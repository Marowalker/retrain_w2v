Flavonoid glycosides have shown many pharmacological
activities in clinical studies. However, the main way to obtain flavonoid
glycosides is to extract and separate them from plants, which wastes
both time and resources. Here, we identified the O-glycosyltransferase (UGTs) TwUGT3 from Tripterygium
wilfordii and analyzed its bioinformatics. First,
the enzyme was found to utilize phloretin and uridine diphosphate
glucose (UDPG) as substrates to produce an acid-tolerant glucoside.
Then, it also can use quercetin and UDPG as substrates to produce
the corresponding O-glucoside. In addition, we further
explored the substrate specificity of TwUGT3, which suggested that
it also accepts luteolin, pinocembrin, and genistein to produce the
corresponding O-glucosides. Subsequently, the optimum
pH, reaction time, reaction temperature, and enzymatic kinetic parameters
of TwUGT3 were determined.

==== Body
Introduction
At the time of writing, more than 8000
flavonoids and their derivatives were known to be widely distributed
in plants,1 many of which are associated
with potential benefits for human health.2 They act as pigments or signal compounds in various parts of plant
organs and have multiple functions. For example, they are involved
in UV-B protection and plant–microbe interactions, while also
providing antifungal and antibacterial activity.3−5 Furthermore,
the antioxidant activity of flavonoids is closely related to human
health, which has attracted widespread attention.1

Glycosylation is one of the major modifications of
phytochemicals. It plays vital roles in many physiological characteristics
and functions of plants and is also a common modification of flavonoids.6,7 Glycosylases can change the solubility, stability, and other physical
and physiological characteristics of their substrates and are consequently
considered to play a role in the bioactivity of modified plant metabolites
and the accumulation of flavonoids.8,9 Studies have
indicated that there are two main types of glycosylation: O-glycosylation
and C-glycosylation. At present, glycosylation is mainly achieved
by glycosyltransferase catalysis, which has played a key role in the
discovery and development of drugs.10,11 In addition,
flavonoids have good biological activities after glycosylation, including
antioxidant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive activities,
and similar effects.12−15

Tripterygium wilfordii Hook
f. is a plant from the Euonymus family, Celastraceae, which had been
used as a traditional medicinal plant for centuries in China.16 It is used to treat fever, chills, edema, and
suppuration.17 Modern studies have shown
that triptolide and its related substances are the main active constituents
of Tripterygium. These substances showed
broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, antidiuretic,
and anticancer activities and were mainly used to treat autoimmune
diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic psoriasis.18−26

In this study, we cloned the glycosyltransferase TwUGT3 from T. wilfordii, expressed
it, and analyzed the substrate specificity of the recombinant enzyme.

Results
Sequence and Molecular Phylogenetic Analysis
A full-length
coding sequence for UDP-glycosyltransferase was identified by searching
against the NCBI nonredundant protein sequence database, the NCBI
nonredundant nucleotide sequence database, the Protein Family database,
the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins 3 database, a manually
annotated and reviewed protein sequence database, the KEGG ortholog
database, and the Gene Ontology database to exploit and note the T. wilfordii transcriptome (SRA accession number:
SRR6001265). Subsequently, based on the full-length sequence, we designed
primers and cloned the TwUGT3 glycosyltransferase
gene. The sequence analysis indicated that TwUGT3
had an open reading frame (ORF) of 1380 bp, encoding a protein of
459 amino acids with a molecular weight of 50.8 kDa and a theoretical
pI of 5.41. Through domain analysis, we obtained the conservative
site (335–378) of the TwUGT3 gene. To analyze
the specific triptophenolide glycosyltransferase, the PRABI-LG service
was utilized to predict the secondary structure of TwUGT3. The result
indicated that the protein had an alpha helix content of 43.57%, along
with 15.47% extended strands and 40.96% random coils. Subsequently,
a three-level model of TwUGT3 protein was constructed using SWISS-MODEL
(Figure S1).

Subsequently, a molecular
tree (Figure 1) was
established based on the translated amino acid sequences of TwUGT3
and other reported genes screened from NCBI. The results of molecular
phylogenetic analysis indicated that TwUGT3 belongs
to the CGT (OG15) family. The enzymes from the OG15 family that convert
2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone-like structures
formed a clade. Subsequently, the PSPG-motif of TwUGT3 was found by
multiple sequence alignment (Figure 1). Therefore, phloretin, which has a 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone-like
structure, was selected as the initial substrate for the preliminary
experiments. As illustrated in Figure 2a, there was a new product (peak 2) that was detected
in the reaction using a crude enzyme (Figure 2a). Subsequently, the product was detected
after incubation with hydrochloric acid for 3 h at 60 °C (Figure 2a). Therefore, it
is speculated that the product is an acid-resistant hydrolyzed glycoside.
The analysis results of UPLC/Q-TOF-MS (ultrahigh-performance liquid
chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry)
indicated that the molecular ion peak of the product may be 597.18,
and the speculated product may be combined with two glucoses in phloretin.
However, no products were detected in the reaction using a purified
enzyme (Figure 2b).
Related experiments such as enzymatic kinetics require pure enzymes
to detect, so quercetin was chosen as a new substrate for subsequent
experiments.

Figure 1 Bioinformatics analysis of TwUGT3. (a) Phylogenetic tree
analysis of TwUGT3. A molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed
using the adjacency method in MEG6 software which is based on the
UGT amino acid sequence deduced from the reported UGT gene. The representative
genes of UGT families such as 708 families, 88 families, 84 families,
78 families, 76 families, and 73 families were selected for cluster
analysis. TwUGT3 was clustered into 708 families. (b) Multiple sequence
alignment analysis. Functionally validated genes were screened by
NCBI BLAST, and multiple sequence alignment analysis was carried out
by DNAMAN software. The label section shows the protected area of
plant UGT (PSPG-motif) which represents the amino acid residues required
for the nucleophilic reaction of conserved sugar receptors in UDP
sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Abbreviations and GenBank
accession numbers were shown in Table S1.

Verification of Enzyme Activity
To confirm the activity
of the enzyme TwUGT3, we cloned the full-length cDNA into pMAL-c2x
with a maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag and introduced it into Escherichia coli. By culturing the recombinant E. coli with the target gene, we obtained the crude
enzyme for enzymatic reactions in vitro. The results (Figure 3a) indicated that the recombinant
TwUGT3 had O-glycosylation activity.

1, isoquercitrin and 2, quercetin.

We cultured strains of E. coli, respectively, harboring the recombinant plasmid and the blank vector
and obtained corresponding protein extracts, which were then used
to catalyze the glycosylation of quercetin in vitro, and the products
were analyzed via UPLC. The chromatogram obtained using the recombinant
strain (Figure 3a)
contained a major peak with a retention time of 8.674 min (peak 2),
which was similar to that of standard quercetin (8.658 min). Furthermore,
the chromatogram contained a peak at 7.384 min (peak 1; Figure 3a), the retention time of which
was similar to that of isoquercitrin, in addition to the major peak
of quercetin (peak 2). Our results therefore revealed that the recombinant
enzyme TwUGT3 displayed glycosyltransferase activity.

Protein Purification and Characterization of the Catalytic Products
of the Pure Enzyme
After confirming the catalytic activity
of the crude enzyme via UPLC analysis, we next attempted to purify
the UGT enzyme using the solubility-promoting MBP tag27 and explored the catalytic properties of the recombinant
TwUGT3. First, we obtained the pure enzyme, as confirmed by the results
of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
analysis shown in Figure 3b.

As illustrated in Figure 3b, we analyzed the purified protein using
markers with a molecular weight range from 35 to 180 kDa. The proteins
of the blank vector strain were mainly concentrated in the parts with
a molecular weight of less than 50 kDa. In contrast, the molecular
weight of the recombinant protein was about 90 kDa. Analysis of SDS-PAGE
showed that we obtained relatively pure recombinant protein and could
further study the enzymatic reaction of the pure enzyme.

Subsequently,
we carried out reactions using the pure enzyme in vitro with quercetin
and UDPG as substrates and analyzed the structure of the product by
UPLC/Q-TOF-MS.

As expected, we discovered a peak that exhibited
the [M – H]− at m/z 463.0921, corresponding to a glucoside of quercetin (Figure 3c). A fragment ion
of [M – H – 162]− at m/z 301.0343 was also detected in the mass spectrum
(Figure 3c), corresponding
to the [M – H]− of quercetin. The retention
time was similar to that of the standard compound, suggesting that
the product is isoquercitrin.

Enzyme Assays
To confirm the Km value of TwUGT3, the factors that may affect enzyme activity
were investigated, such as pH, temperature, reaction time, and so
forth. The optimum temperature and pH of purified TwUGT3 was 35 °C
and 7.0, respectively, under the conditions of glycosylation for 24
h (Figure 4). The kinetic
parameters of recombinant TwUGT3 were measured by using a GraphPad
Prism 7.00, and the Km and Vmax values were 64.1 μmoL and 1.557 × 10–2 μmoL/min/mg, respectively.

Figure 4 Effects of various pH
values (a), temperatures (b), and reaction time (c) on the optimum
enzyme activity of TwUGT3, determination of kinetic parameters for
TwUGT3 (d). UDPG was used as a sugar donor, and quercetin was used
as a substrate. (a) I, II, III, and IV correspond to citric acid–sodium
citrate buffer, Na2HPO4–NaH2PO4 buffer, Tris-HCl buffer and s Na2CO3–NaHCO3 buffer. X-axis
shows that the highest activity of TwUGT3 is 100% at different temperature,
reaction time, and pH value, and the other values are the relative
activity of the enzyme.

Substrate Specificity of TwUGT3
To confirm the substrate
specificity of the recombinant enzyme TwUGT3, we further screened
different types of compounds as substrates. Several terpenoids from T. wilfordii, tetracyclic triterpenoids, coumarins,
lignanoids, flavonoids, and stilbene (Table 1) were selected as substrates for in vitro
enzymatic activity tests with the pure recombinant enzyme TwUGT3 and
UDP-glucose. Seventeen compounds were selected as substrates for enzymatic
reactions in vitro, but the UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis (Figure 5) indicated that the recombinant
enzyme only catalyzed the production of luteolin 3-O-β-d-glucofuranoside, pinocembrin 7-O-β-d-glucoside, and sophoricoside from luteolin, pinocembrin,
and genistein, respectively.

reaction products. (a) Luteolin (2) as the substrate,

(6) as the substrate. Corresponding products are cymaroside
(1), pinocembrin 7-O-β-d-glucoside (3), and sophoricoside (5),
compared with the retention time and the mass spectrum signal of the
reference authentic standards (Figures S2–S4).

The recombinant enzyme displayed signs of O-glycosylation
activity toward some flavonoids, such as quercetin and luteolin. In
contrast, it did not convert terpenoids, suggesting that flavone-like
structures are necessary for substrates to be acceptable by TwUGT3.
The catalytic activity of the enzyme TwUGT3 for luteolin, pinocembrin,
and genistein was low. It could only be judged whether it has any
catalytic activity by extracting the characteristic peak of the corresponding
glycoside from the mass spectrum.

Materials and Methods
Plant Material
T. wilfordii suspension cells were cultured in the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium
containing 0.5 mg·L–1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
acid (2,4-D), 0.5 mg·L–1 indole-3-butytric
acid, 0.1 mg·L–1 kinetin, and 30 g·L–1 sucrose at 25 °C in a rotary shaker at 120 rpm
in the dark.

Cloning and Sequence Analysis of TwUGT3
Total RNA was
extracted from T. wilfordii suspension
cells utilizing the Eastep Super Total RNA Extraction Kit (Promega
Biological Technology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). RNAs were checked
by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized using a Vilber
Lourmat imaging system. The FastKing RT Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing,
China) was used to synthesize cDNA according to manufacturer’s
protocol. The primers TwUGT3R (CTACCAGTTGTTCTTCCACTCACG)
and TwUGT3F (ATGTCGGACTCCGGTGACTT) were designed
using Primer Premier 5.0 software (Premier, BC, Canada) and synthesized
by the Ruibo Biotech Company (Beijing, China). The glycosyltransferase
gene was cloned from the cDNA library using the 2× KAPA HiFi
HotStart ReadyMix. PCR amplification was performed with an initial
5 min step at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C,
30 s at 58.5 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C, and a final 7 min step
at 72 °C. The GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA) was used to purify the PCR products, which were ligated into
the pEASY-Blunt Zero cloning vector (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). E. coliTrans1-T1 phage-resistant
cells (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) were transformed with the
ligated vector and cultured in the Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with
100 mg/L ampicillin at 37 °C in the dark. Then, the Beijing Ruibo
Biotech Company used an ABI 370XL automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
USA) to sequence the positive individual bacterial clones, and the
resulting sequence was aligned with the transcriptome sequence.

Phylogenetic and Bioinformatic Analysis
The sequence
of TwUGT3 was analyzed (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and the ORFs were identified online (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/). The calculate molecular weight (Mw) and theoretical isoelectric point (pI) were analyzed using the
Compute pI/Mw tool (http://Web.ExPASy.org/compute_pi/). PRABI-GERIAND (https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/) was used to predict the secondary structure of the recombinant
enzyme. SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) is used to construct the protein tertiary model. Amino acid sequences
of similar enzymes were downloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The multiple sequence alignment was carried out using DNAMAN,
and the phylogenetic tree was established using the MEGA 6.0 with
the neighbor-joining method, with 1000 replicates and the p-distance model.

Heterologous Expression of TwUGT3
The expression plasmid
pMAL-c2x-TwUGT3 and a the pMAL-c2x control plasmid were used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (TransGen Biotech,
Beijing, China). Subsequently, 300 μL of an overnight culture
of the cells were added into a 300 mL LB medium with 100 μg/L
ampicillin. The bacterial cultures were shaken (250 rpm) at 37 °C
until the OD600 between reached 0.6 and 0.8. Then, 300
μL of 1 M isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG)
was added to induce the E. coli, which
was shaken (200 rpm) at 16 °C for 16 h. The cells were harvested
by centrifugal separation (13 000g, 2 min,
4 °C), the supernatant was discarded, the cells were shock-frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.

Enzyme Purification
The bacterial cells taken from
the −80 °C freezer were thawed on ice and resuspended
in 5 mL of resuspension buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5% glycerol,
and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5]. After resuspension,
the cells were mixed with chicken egg white lysozyme (0.5 mg·mL–1) and lysed on ice for 20 min. Triton X-100 (0.1%)
and NaCl (0.5 mol·L–1) were added to the mixture
and sonicated in an ice bath for 10 s, with pausing for 10 s. Subsequently,
the supernatant after centrifugation (12 000g, 4 °C) for 30 min was mixed with 1.0 mL of amylose resin (New
England Biolabs, Beijing, China) and shaken for 2 h. Subsequently,
the resin was washed six times with 15 mL of washing buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol, pH
7.5) and 15 mL of resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5). In the next step,
2 mL of elution buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM DTT, 2 mM maltose, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5) and 5 mL of elution
buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM
maltose, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5) were used to wash the resin. Finally,
the elution was concentrated to less than 500 μL using Amicon
Ultra-30K filters (Millipore, Merck KGaA, USA) and stored at −80
°C. The enzyme purity was determined by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration
was measured using a modified Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech,
Shanghai, China).

In Vitro Enzyme Assays of TwUGT3
The in vitro enzymatic
reaction system was composed of a 100 μL reaction solution comprising
100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mM sugar donor (uridine diphosphate
glucose, UDPG), 100 μM substrate, and 50 μg of purified
recombinant TwUGT3 protein. The reaction system was incubated at 35
°C for 24 h, and the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μL
of HPLC-grade methanol. Finally, the products were detected by UPLC-molecular
weight determination/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MWD/ESI-MS/MS).

To determine the optimal pH, we routinely conducted three parallel
assays. The reactions mixtures containing 50 μg of purified
recombinant TwUGT3 protein, 1 mM UDPG, and 100 μM quercetin
were prepared in buffers with various pH values (4.0–6.0: 100
mM citric acid–sodium citrate buffer; 6.0–8.0: 100 mM
Na2HPO4–NaH2PO4 buffer; 7.0–9.0: 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer; and 9.0–11.0:
100 mM Na2CO3–NaHCO3 buffer)
and incubated at 35 °C for 24 h.

To confirm the optimal
temperature, we routinely conducted three parallel assays. The enzymatic
reactions were performed at different temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35,
40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 70 °C) for 24 h; the reaction mixtures
consisted of 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM UDPG, and 100 μM
quercetin.

To indicate the optimal reaction times, we routinely
conducted three parallel assays. The reaction times were set at 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 24, and 48 h; the mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM UDPG, and 100 μM quercetin, and the reaction
was performed at 35 °C.

To analyze the kinetic parameters,
hyperbolic Michalis–Menten saturation curves for the substrates
were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 7.0 with the peak areas of
the compounds. The reaction was conducted in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0)
with 1 mM UDPG and quercetin (40–400 μM) at 35 °C
for 13 h. The reactions were stopped with 200 μL of MeOH, and
the reaction products of TwUGT3 catalysis were quantified by UPLC-diode
array detector (UPLC-DAD).

Discussion
Isoquercitrin, a flavonoid derived from
the medicinal plant Apocynum venetum L., is widely distributed in plants, fruits, and flowers.28,29 Isoquercitrin possesses many biological activities, such as antioxidant
activities, free radical scavenging activities, neuroprotective effects,
anti-inflammatory effects, antihypertensive effects, antitumor effects,
diuretic effects, and so on.30−35 At present, isoquercitrin mainly removes rhamnose from rutin by
hydrolysis of Venus kinase. However, many byproducts and other small
metabolites will be produced in this way, which will make the subsequent
separation and purification process more difficult.36−38 Therefore,
the gene obtained in this experiment can be used to construct the
corresponding biosynthetic pathway for isoquercitrin.

According
to the result of the crude enzyme reaction, TwUGT3 has a strong activity
on phloretin, and after terminating the reaction, phloretin can be
completely converted into a product. The product did not change after
acid hydrolysis at high temperature, so it is believed that TwUGT3
can efficiently catalyze phlorizin to produce acid-tolerant glucosides.
This is the first discovery of a glycosyltransferase from T. wilfordii, which can catalyze the production of
acid-resistant glucoside from flavonoid.

His-tag and MBP tag
are two commonly used in the prokaryotic expression system of protein.
pET-32a (+) with His-tag was use used to express TwUGT3 recombinant
protein. However, because of the continuous formation of protein inclusion
body, it was decided to use pMAL-c2x with MBP-tag to express TwUGT3.
MBP-tag is a soluble protein label, which can increase the solubility
of fusion protein. However, because of its high molecular weight,
about 40 kDa, it has a certain impact on the structure of protein.
TwUGT3 was found to bind to MBP tag to form fusion protein, which
may affect its activity to potential flavonoids. In addition, when
exploring the optimum reaction conditions of TwUGT3, we found that
TwUGT3 was too sensitive to the change of the pH value, possibly because
MBP tags affected the structure of fusion protein, so the pH value
had a great influence on protein activity. Comparing the enzymatic
reaction results of pure enzyme and crude enzyme, it is speculated
that it may be due to the MBP-tag, which affects the structure of
TwUGT3 protein resulting in that the product cannot be detected.

So far, the glycosyltransferase in T. wilfordii is rarely reported. Therefore, the extraction of glycosides in T. wilfordii is still in the exploration stage. At
present, the main glycosides that can be formed in T. wilfordii are terpenoids, such as triptolide.39 The C-glycosides in T. wilfordii have not been found. Therefore, although flavonoids are rarely found
in T. wilfordii, TwUGT3 obtained from T. wilfordii has a strong specificity for flavonoids
and is of great significance.40 Therefore,
the construction of a compound biosynthetic chassis cell for industrial
production should not be limited to the species in which the compound
is located. This knowledge can expand the research horizon to identify
the right genes.
