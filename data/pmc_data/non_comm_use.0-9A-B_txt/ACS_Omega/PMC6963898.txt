Drug delivery in excess concentrations and at not-specified sites
inside the human body adversely affects the body and gives rise to
other diseases. Several methods have been developed to deliver the
drugs in required amounts and at specific targets. Nanoparticle-mediated
drug delivery is one such approach and has gained success at primary
levels. The effect of nanoparticles on the human body needs important
apprehension, and it has been unraveled by assessing the protein–nanoparticle
interactions. Here, we have measured the impact of silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) on the human serum albumin (HSA) structure and function with
the help of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). HSA is
a transport protein, and any change in the structure may obstruct
its function. The post MD analyses showed that the NP interacts with
HSA and the conjugated system got stabilized with time evolution of
trajectories. The present investigation confirms that the AgNP interacts
with HSA without affecting its tertiary and secondary structures and
in turn the protein function as well. AgNP application is recommended
in transporting conjugated drug molecules as it has no adverse effect
on serum proteins. Since HSA is present in the circulatory system,
it may open various applications of AgNPs in the biomedical field.

1 Introduction
Nanoparticles (NPs) are materials of sizes in the range of nanometers
(1–100 nm), and they possess different physical, optical, and
electronic properties compared to those of their bulk counterparts.1 NPs exhibit different properties due to their
sizes and high surface areas compared to bulk materials and have various
applications in diverse fields. Neamtu et al. used functionalized
magnetic nanoparticles for wastewater treatment.2 Nanoparticles have been used in hydrogen sensors,3 photoacoustic molecular imaging,4 solar cells,5 and chemical products
such as cosmetics, polymer fillers, catalysts, and many more.6

NPs have various biomedical applications such as in bioimaging,7,8 diagnosis,9,10 and drug delivery.11 There are mainly two approaches that have been
used in drug delivery. One is the conjugation of drugs with a suitable
nanoparticle to deliver at the site of action, and another is to encapsulate
the drug inside a nanoparticle for subsequent release at the specific
cell or tissue. These approaches depend upon the type of nanoparticle
as well as the ligand property and have advantage over traditional
drug delivery. In this method, lesser amounts of the drug are needed
to be administered into the body, which also reduce the unwanted side
effects.12,13

Nanoparticles upon coming in contact with biomolecules (e.g., proteins,
DNA, or lipids) interact with each one of them in a specific manner.14 Proteins form a layer around NPs, which is termed
as protein corona after having an interaction with the nanoparticle.
The biological reactivity of the different nanoparticles is dictated
by the stability of the protein corona. In the recent times, different
types of research have been done on the protein–nanoparticle
aspect, which aid in understanding the adsorption behavior of NPs
on proteins.15 The adsorption of the protein
onto the nanoparticle may bring some conformational rearrangement,
which might alter the protein function. Apart from the adsorption
pattern, studies focus on the effect of nanoparticles on the three-dimensional
structure of the protein.16 Factors contributing
to conformational changes in the proteins are shape, size, surface
charge, and the type of nanoparticles. As the function depends upon
the 3D structure of the protein, significant changes in the structure
shall lead to inactivity of the protein, which in turn makes it toxic.
Ahmed et al. screened fullerene-based nanoparticles on varied protein
targets encompassing different biological functions.17

Different groups have used various types of nanomaterials to study
their effects on biomolecules. Investigations using both experimental
and computational approaches give insight into the protein–NP
interactions at the molecular level. Experimental studies provide
understanding at the macroscopic level, for example, Chatterjee et
al. showed the structural changes of the ToxR protein of Vibrio cholerae upon ZnO NP binding.18 Computational approaches based on molecular dynamics simulations
(MDS) and density functional theory assist in understanding the protein–NP
interactions at the atomic level, for example, Radic et al. delineated
the role of the surface chemistry of fullerene on protein misfolding,
and also Tang et al. showed unfolding of collagen triple helices with
gold NPs.19,20 Luan et al. also showed the toxicity of
graphene sheets by MDS.21 Combination of
experimental and computational techniques has been used to analyze
the efficacy of antimicrobial peptides (nisin) upon conjugation with
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs).22

Earlier work from our group has helped us to understand the applicability
of the drug delivery property of CNTs (carbon nanotubes) mediated
by fullerenes as a function of time.23 Also,
we have shown how graphene, SWCNTs (single-wall carbon nanotubes),
and boron nitride nanomaterials facilitate and improve the recognition
of pyrazinamide drug molecules in the active site of the pncA protein.24,25 The effect of moonlight protein bovine lactoferrin (BLF) and AgNP
conjugation on protein conformation, NP cytotoxicity, and its bacteriostatic
function was analyzed.15 Interaction of
insulin with ZnO NPs has led to enhanced rates of its fibrillation
wherein ZnO NPs act as a favorable template for insulin nucleation
and growth, which ultimately leads to amyloid fibril formation.26

It is well understood that any drug has to transverse thorough
the blood plasma to reach tissues and organs. NPs to be used for drug
delivery have to come in contact with blood and interact with the
most amply available blood proteins. One of the most abundant proteins
in the blood system is serum albumin, which constitutes approximately
60% of the blood plasma. Fanali et al. did a comparative analysis
of the serum albumins to show that, among the sequences from 49 varied
organisms encompassing mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes,
most of them are made up of three repeated domains whereas lamprey
serum albumin is made up of seven domains.27 Li et al. further did a comparative analysis of serum albumins,
which includes animals, plants, bacteria, fungi, and archaea, and
pointed out that serum albumins are only present in vertebrates.28 They showed that serum albumin, α-fetoprotein,
vitamin D-binding protein, and afamin had an evolutionary relationship
among them and reported a new member of the albumin family termed
extracellular matrix protein 1.

Human serum albumin (HSA) plays an important role in the transportation
of endogenous and exogenous compounds such as fatty acids, bile acids,
and a wide range of drugs. Further, HSA helps in regulating the colloid
oncotic pressure.29 Numerous studies on
HSA had culminated into more than a hundred crystallographic solved
structures in the protein data bank (PDB)30 in the recent time. The culmination of so many structures can be
attributed to the property of HSA, which is able to bind and transport
a number of different ligands. Due to its transport function, several
groups have studied the interactions of clinically important drugs
and small molecules with HSA.31,32 It had a tremendous
impact on the clinical studies and led to a better understanding of
the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as axitinib33 and doxorubicin.34

The use of NPs in drug delivery will be feasible only when HSA–NP
interaction does not change the protein conformation. It becomes important
to study the effect of different NPs on the HSA structure. Ramezani
et al. showed the decrement in the structural content of the HSA protein
in the presence of cubic and spherical gold nanoparticles using MDS.35 Using computational approaches, Shao and Hall
brought forth another interesting aspect about the allosteric effect
of HSA and prompted the community dealing with nanobiotechnology to
consider it while designing and applying for biomedical purposes.36 Leonis et al. showed interactive study of HSA
with fullerenes using computational approaches.37

We have considered AgNPs because they are one of the most extensively
investigated nanoparticles due to their therapeutic, electrical, and
optical potential. They have great implications in the biomedical
arena because of their antimicrobial activity;38 also, they are used in nanosilver-based biomedical products,
for example, drug-delivery platforms, orthopedic materials, and bandages,
and in antimicrobial compositions.39 Even
though they have shown great potential in the ever growing field of
nanobiotechnology, some adverse effects have also been reported.40,41

In this work, we have investigated the structural flexibility and
dynamics of the HSA protein in the presence of AgNPs in different
orientations, which have been considered in such a way that each domain
of HSA interacts with the AgNP. In case a selected NP undergoes clinical
trials in different organisms, the serum albumin from other species
should also have no effect. Hence, it becomes imperative to calculate
the similarity between serum albumin from humans and other species
at sequence levels. The interactions between AgNP and the HSA protein
have been deciphered by all-atom molecular dynamics simulation.

2 Results
2.1 Sequence Analysis
Thirteen sequences
of serum albumin from different organisms, including humans, after
performing BLASTP were retrieved, and multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) was done. The selected organisms are generally used for in vivo
experiments in clinical trials. As the sequences (S1 to S13) are for
the same protein, we can observe a higher amount of similarity between
them (Figure S1). The maximum and minimum
lengths among all the sequences are 615 (chicken) and 600 (macaque). Table 1 shows the percent
identity and the query coverage of all of the sequences compared to
the HSA sequence. From Table 1, we can observe that the macaque showed a maximum percent
identity of 93.5% and the chicken showed a minimum percent identity
of 47.45% with HSA, and the query coverage is in the range of 98–100%.
Six different subdomains (present in humans) are shown in Figure S1a–f. Figure S1 shows that all of the higher organisms share a significant
amount of similarity at the domain level, which in turn may give them
a similar 3D structure.

2.2 Simulation Trajectory Analysis
To
gain insight into the dynamics of human serum albumin (HSA) with silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs), we have performed MD simulations on the native
protein and protein–NP complex. In order to measure the effect
of AgNP on the protein’s structure, we have carried out five
sets of simulations wherein the AgNP spanned different domains of
the protein. Information about the structural deviations and stability
of the protein is provided by the parameter root-mean-square deviations
(RMSDs). Figure 1a
shows the RMSD plot of the protein for all the considered simulations,
and from the RMSD analysis, it can be interpreted that the protein
in water fluctuates in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 nm, which is similar
to earlier reported simulation studies.42,43 In the case
of the control (only protein), some fluctuations are observed till
60 ns of simulation, and thereafter it gets stabilized till the end
of the simulation time.

Figure 1 a: RMSD plot of HSA in the presence and absence of AgNPs. b: RMSF
plot of overall fluctuations of the residues of HSA in the presence
of AgNPs.

In the case of OR1, after a few fluctuations till 50 ns of time,
the RMSD converges and maintains its stability until 150 ns. In OR2,
the protein showed a similar behavior to that of the native structure
and with few numbers of fluctuations; it converges after 130 ns. Compared
to the native, OR3 showed quite a number of minor fluctuations, which
stabilize toward the end of simulation, whereas in OR4 and OR5, the
protein showed a similar behavior to the native. Overall, the RMSDs
of the simulations in the presence of NPs were within the range of
0.3–0.6 nm. No significant changes were observed among the
simulation trajectories in the presence of NPs compared to the bare
protein. Additionally, the RMSD of domain regions interacting with
the AgNP was observed, shown in Figure S2, which also showed a similar behavior to that of the overall RMSD
analysis. Thus, the protein does not illustrate any abnormal structural
change in the presence of AgNPs during complete simulation.

In order to understand the residue-wise fluctuations of the protein
over the simulation time, root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) were
calculated. The RMSF analysis sheds light on the fluctuations of residues,
which in turn show their significance as any drastic changes in the
flexibility of the functionally important residues will affect the
HSA’s function. From Figure 1b, we can observe that the overall fluctuations of
the residues of the HSA in the presence of AgNPs in all five simulations
were similar to those of the control. The overlap of the RMSF plots
(five orientations) with that of the bare protein suggests that there
is no influence on the residue flexibility of HSA upon AgNP binding.

2.3 Effect of AgNP on Individual Residues
In order to get a better picture of the behavior of the residue fluctuations,
we have compared the residue level variations in the presence and
absence of NPs by calculating the parameter ΔRMSFi. Comparative flexibilities of the protein residues
in the presence of the NP in the five orientations are tabulated in Table 2. As HSA is a large
protein, we have considered three groups of amino acids on the basis
of the numerical value of ΔRMSF. This parameter measures the
relative flexibility of the residue and groups them into three categories:
(i) reduced, (ii) unchanged, or (iii) increased flexibility in the
presence of NPs.

Table 2 Percentage of Residues in the Three
Categories
 	amino acids (in %)	
systems	<−0.4	[−0.4, 0.4]	>0.4	
OR1	13	86	1	
OR2	2	91	7	
OR3	9	90	1	
OR4	15	84	1	
OR5	20	79	1	
From Table 2, we
can observe that the flexibility of the residues follows a similar
trend among the first four conjugates. In the first four conjugates,
the majority of the residues fall within the unchanged category, which
suggests that the presence of AgNPs does not alter their flexibility;
thus, it would not affect the function rendered altogether by the
protein. In OR5, in the presence of two NPs, 20% of the residue’s
flexibility is reduced although 79% falls in the unchanged category.
Thus, it can be said that, in the presence of higher concentrations
of NPs, the flexibility of residues might slightly change compared
to single-NP conjugates. As the flexibility of the majority of the
residues did not change, we can infer that the presence of AgNPs does
not have any structural effect on the HSA protein.

2.4 Secondary Structure Analysis of HSA
The adsorption of any nanoparticle on the protein’s surface
might have an effect on the secondary structure of the protein. The
function of a protein solely depends on the structure of the protein;
therefore, any alteration in its structure might disrupt its normal
functioning. We have carried out DSSP analysis of HSA for all of the
orientations and compared it with the control. The probability values
in terms of the persistence of helical and loop structural contents
throughout the simulation period for all the orientations were plotted
and are shown in Figure S3. From the plot
(Figure S3a,b), it was inferred that the p value is more than 0.7 for most of the residues, which
means that they remain in the same category of secondary structure
during the simulation. Further, no noticeable variation was witnessed
compared to the control, which suggests that the protein retains its
structure in the presence of the NP.

To gain more insight, we
have calculated the parameter ΔSeci, which provides a comparative change in the secondary structure
of individual amino acid. We have allocated the number of residues
into three categories: residues that maintained their structure (ΔSeci < 0.2), those that have moderate changes
(0.2 ≤ ΔSeci ≥ 0.5),
and ones that changed their structure significantly (ΔSeci > 0.5). The number of residues in these categories
has been tabulated in Table 3. Table 3 shows
that approximately 95% of residues maintain their structure upon AgNP
adsorption with residues mainly belonging to the helical part of the
protein. Only 6–8% of the residues show moderate changes in
the structure. As few residues fall into the third category, this
indicates that hardly any residues show change in the secondary structure
in any of the orientations. This analysis further confirms our previous
observations from RMSD and RMSF analyses in that adsorption of AgNPs
on the HSA protein has no negative impact on its structure.

Table 3 Number of Residues Categorized into
Three Groups
 	number of residues	
orientation	[<0.2]	[0.2, 0.5]	[>0.5]	
OR1	526	50	6	
OR2	539	41	2	
OR3	540	42	0	
OR4	543	38	1	
OR5	528	50	4	
2.5 Number of Nonbonded Contacts
From
the above observations, it can be said that the selected NP makes
no impact on the protein structure. Even the residue-level comparison
between the simulations of bare protein and protein–NP conjugates
validates that the protein remains unaltered. It may be possible that
the nanoparticle is not able to interact with the protein. This possibility
has been ruled out by tracking down the interaction between the AgNP
and protein through the number of nonbonded contacts during the simulation.
The measured number of nonbonded contacts between the nanoparticle
and protein for all the orientations through the simulation time is
shown in Figure 2.
It can be observed in Figure 2 that all of the conjugates make a number of contacts within
6 Å, which increase at the start and are maintained till the
end of simulation. Among all the conjugates, OR1 made the most nonbonded
contacts followed by OR4 and OR5 (the number of contacts for two NPs
were measured separately for OR5) with AgNPs. The interactive amino
acids with the AgNP have been accounted and are given in Table S1. The number of amino acids within the
nonbonded distance cutoff is in the range of 18–32 in different
orientations. It comprises mainly charged amino acids, which have
been further validated in interaction energy calculation wherein the
Coulombic energy is observed to be a highly contributing term toward
the stability of the HSA–AgNP system. It can be inferred from
these nonbonded interaction calculations that the protein interacts
with the AgNP, and the convergence of the curves in all cases suggests
that they maintain their level of interaction throughout the 150 ns
time.

Figure 2 Number of nonbonded contacts between HSA and AgNP within 6 Å.

2.6 Protein–AgNP Interaction Energy
Additionally, the protein–NP interaction energy, which deciphers
the interaction of this protein with silver nanoparticles, was quantified
and compared. The process of adsorption of the AgNP on HSA in different
simulations was compared on the basis of the average energy of the
systems. The negative value of change in the average energy (ΔE) indicates interactions between the protein and AgNP (given
in Table 4). From the
data (Table 4), we
can observe that the Coulombic (SR) energy is the most contributing
nonbonded term toward the stable interactions between the protein
and AgNP.

Table 4 Interaction Energy of the Five Simulated
Systems
 	ΔE (106 kJ mol–1)	
energy term	OR1	OR2	OR3	OR4	OR5	
Coulombic (SR)	–2.1034	–2.4218	–1.8121	–1.8467	–3.4194	
potential energy	–1.7897	–2.0522	–1.5329	–1.5627	–3.4544	
total energy	–1.4670	–1.6823	–1.2563	–1.2807	–2.9176	
On comparing the ΔE of all the orientations,
it was observed that OR5 is the most stable among all of the systems.
It can be attributed to the fact that the fifth case consists of two
NPs around the HSA protein. The interactions happening at the interphase
of the HSA protein and the AgNP contribute toward the net negative
energy values of the total and potential energies as shown in Table 4. This negative ΔE further confirms our nonbonded contact analysis signifying
interactions happening between the AgNP and protein.

3 Discussion
Use of nanoparticles in the targeted drug delivery regime is gaining
importance because of their ability to hold and carry along with a
slow and effective release of small molecules at the specialized locations.9 In this process, the NP has to interact with
the biomolecules, especially the proteins inside the cell. A set of
nanoparticles, such as fullerene, iron oxide, silver, gold, and silica,
have been tested against different proteins to see their effect on
the protein structure and function.37,44−47 In case a selected NP changes the protein structure and in turn
its function, it becomes toxic and so cannot be used for drug delivery.18 The drug-carrier nanoparticles have to interact
with blood plasma proteins during the transport of molecules.

Here, we have chosen a blood plasma protein (serum albumin) to
testify the use of nanoparticles as drug carriers. The NP shall carry
the drug through the blood system to the intended target, and it becomes
imperative to measure its impact on the serum albumin protein. Earlier
work by Shao et al. reported the effect of gold nanoparticles on HSA
and showed the changes in the secondary structure at the amino acid
residue level.36 This promoted us to select
another well-studied NP, that is, the silver nanoparticle, and to
measure its impact on HSA. This computational study gave an insight
into the dynamics of AgNP adsorption on HSA. We have endeavored to
look into the protein–NP interaction at the atomic level by
using an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation technique. In experiments,
multiple NPs may interact with a single protein molecule, but it is
computationally expensive to introduce a number of nanoparticles in
one simulation box along with the protein.15,26 Thus, to save our computational cost and also to consider all feasible
interactions, we have considered five different possible orientations
of the AgNP around the HSA protein. In the all-atom explicit simulations,
we have further considered AgNPs of an optimum size of 4.5 nm.22 Too small-sized nanoparticles might get stuck
in the protein binding pockets, or a NP of a bigger size may not be
able to come in close contact with amino acid residues of the protein
as we have considered only a single protein molecule in simulations.

As any drug or nanomedicine has to pass through the clinical phase
trials,48 we intend to take into consideration
the sequence identity of albumin among such organisms, which are utilized
for in vivo experiments. From the multiple sequence alignment, it
can be observed that the HSA showed significant sequence identity
with the other organisms, the AgNP conjugation with albumin of these
organisms may provide similar outcomes.

The effect of silver nanoparticles on the HSA protein structure
was measured by several simulation trajectory-based analyses. It was
observed that all of the simulations with NPs have similar RMSDs to
those of the control simulation suggesting that no change in the protein’s
structure occurred. The domain, close to NPs in different orientations,
RMSD analysis also did not show any major fluctuations. The residue-level
fluctuation-based changes have been accounted by RMSF analysis, which
also showed similar behavior in the presence of AgNPs to that of bare
protein. These results have been further verified by evaluating the
parameter ΔRMSFi, which compares
the residue-level changes in the presence and absence of NPs during
simulations. Here, we have used only side-chain atoms to calculate
the changes because they play a major role in all of the functional
interactions. This analysis confirms that the protein structure remains
intact even at the level of individual amino acids.

Any change in the secondary structure of the HSA protein may lead
to aggregation, which in turn gives toxicity. The DSSP analysis does
not show any deterioration in the secondary structure in the presence
of the AgNP. We have again re-verified the changes in secondary structure
at the amino acid level by comparing the score of the individual residue
in protein–NP conjugate and only-protein simulations. These
sets of investigations of protein–NP complexes point out that
the silver nanoparticle has no negative impact on HSA.

It may be possible that the nanoparticle is not able to interact
with serum proteins during the simulation time. The protein–NP
interaction was tested by measuring the change in the number of nonbonded
contacts and average energy values of systems over the simulation
time analysis. In both analyses, we have shown that the silver nanoparticle
remains in the periphery of the serum protein and the protein–NP
conjugate becomes more stable with time. It is important to mention
here that the nanoparticle should not have any negative effect on
the biomolecules for any biomedical applications. Through an extensive
MDS for multiple interactive orientations of protein–NP complexes,
we have shown that the silver nanoparticle has no toxic effect on
human serum albumin, which may be confirmed experimentally. These
results support the use of silver nanoparticles in biomedical applications.

4 Conclusions
The effect of nanoparticles inside the human body should be checked
before using them for targeted drug delivery. Experimental as well
as theoretical testing of various NPs has ruled out the possibilities
of their utilization for biomedical purposes because of their toxic
effects on biomolecules. The interactions between biological or nanobio
systems at the atomistic level can be understood by using a state-of-the-art
computational technique known as molecular dynamics simulations. This
theoretical work has contributed to finding the relevant and possible
structural effect of AgNPs on human serum proteins.

It is important for the use of any nanomaterial that the presence
of NPs should not alter the 3D structure of the protein as its function
depends on its structure. Thus, with the help of extensive MD simulations,
approximately 1.5 μs, we accounted no negative impact of AgNPs
(4.5 nm) on the HSA protein. The structural analyses, RMSD, RMSF,
and secondary structure of the protein, in the presence of the silver
nanoparticle confirm that HSA behaves in a similar way to that in
the absence of NPs during the complete 150 ns of dynamics. Further,
the nonbonded contacts, number of interacting amino acids, and comparative
analysis of energy components between proteins and nanoparticles have
been measured to ensure their interactions throughout the simulation
time of 150 ns. It is confirmed that the silver nanoparticle interacts
with human serum albumin without affecting its tertiary and secondary
structure. We believe that the AgNP has no toxic effect on the HSA
protein, and it may be utilized to transport drug molecules conjugated
with it.

5 Methodology
5.1 Sequence Analysis
A nanoparticle
as a drug carrier can be used only if it passes through the different
phases of clinical trials. NPs conjugated to a drug interact with
blood plasma proteins during transportation of molecules. The structures
of serum albumin (an important plasma protein) of other organisms,
which are used in clinical trials, should not get affected by AgNP
because the altered structure may change the protein function. It
may be possible only if the sequences of serum albumins from other
organisms are very much similar to HSA. We have performed BLASTP49 analysis using the input sequence of HSA (UniProt
ID: P02768)50 to find out the available
similar albumins in other organisms. A total of 12 sequences similar
to those of HSA were selected, and a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
was performed using Clustal Omega.51

5.2 System Preparation
More than 100
HSA structures are available in the RCSB Protein Data Bank.30 We have selected a structure (PDB ID: 5ID7)52 on the basis of resolution, the number of missing residues,
and the R factor out of 105 human serum albumin structures,
and its coordinates were retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank. It
is a heart-shaped protein made up of 585 residues. The crystal structure
of HSA has three missing residues: 1, 2, and 585. The protein is a
monomer, which comprises three domains named I, II, and III. The three
domains are further subdivided into two subdomains, namely, IA and
IB, IIA and IIB, and IIIA and IIIB. There are two main binding sites,
which are termed as Sudlow sites.53 The
first binding site is located at the core of the subdomain IIA, and
the second Sudlow site is at IIIA. Apart from the Sudlow sites, there
are five small pockets with the ability to bind fatty acids. As there
are no missing residues in either of the Sudlow sites, we proceeded
with the pdb structure. It contains 83 positively and 97 negatively
charged residues. These residues are dispersed throughout the structure
of the protein. It belongs to the α class of proteins having
74% amino acids in its helical structure forming, in total, 32 helices.

The nanoparticle used in this study is the silver nanoparticle
(AgNP). The spherical structure of the AgNP has a diameter of 4.5
nm, taken from an earlier study.54 The
AgNP structure is made up of 3871 Ag atoms. The Lennard-Jones parameters
for the AgNP were considered from the Heinz group.55

The AgNP and protein conjugates were prepared with the molecular
modeling system Chimera.56 We have considered
five different orientations of the protein to interact with the NP
(Figure S4). As mentioned above, the HSA
protein has multiple active sites spread in three domains, and each
of them has been reported to carry different drug molecules. The AgNP
was placed near the active sites of individual domains to observe
the effect of NPs on protein conformation. Only one NP was considered
in the first four orientations, and two nanoparticles of the same
size were used in the last conjugate. The orientations are considered
such that the AgNP encompasses all the domains of the protein (Table 5). In all of the protein–NP
conjugates, the exterior atoms of the NP were kept in a range of 2–4
Å from the protein’s surface. The coordinates of the five
orientations of the HSA protein–AgNP conjugates were further
used to carry out dynamic simulations.

5.3 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To
comprehend the functionality and dynamics of the protein and protein–ligand
systems, MDS has been extensively utilized.57−60 Therefore, in order to understand
the dynamic behavior of the protein in the presence of NPs, molecular
dynamics simulations were carried out with the GROMACS (Groningen
Machine for Chemical Simulations) 2016.4 version.61,62 The parameterized GROMOS 54A7 force field was utilized for all of
the simulations. In this study, seven sets of simulations were carried
out, that is, that of only the HSA protein and of the AgNP and five
sets of protein–NP conjugate systems. All of the systems were
solvated with the SPC (simple point charge) water model, which were
placed in a cubic box that extends to 1.0 nm from the molecule to
the edge of the box. All bonds were constrained with LINCS algorithm.63 Periodic boundary conditions were applied in
all directions. To neutralize the systems having a net negative charge
of 14, prior to the dynamic run, 14 Na+ ions were added
to the protein in all simulations. This initial preparation was followed
by energy minimization with the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance
of 1000 kJ mol–1 nm–1. The minimized
systems were equilibrated in two phases. First, the systems were equilibrated
at constant volume and temperature (NVT) for 2 ns,
which was then followed by a 5 ns equilibration at constant pressure
and temperature (NPT). The temperature and pressure
were fixed at 300 K and 1 bar, respectively, with the aid of a velocity-rescale
thermostat64 and Parrinello–Rahman
barostat algorithm.65 Final production
runs were carried out after the equilibration phase for 150 ns with
a time step of 2 fs. The number of atoms in these simulations is approximately
0.3–0.4 million. All of the trajectories of the completed production
runs were analyzed with the available tools of the GROMACS package.
Approximately 1.5 μs of simulation was done with a GPU-based
server containing eight physical Intel Xeon CPU cores with two NVIDIA
Tesla P100 graphic cards. It took an average time of 15 days to run
a simulation for only one configuration. The observations were rechecked
after performing repeat simulations of 100 ns for each orientation,
which show similar results. Results are shown for the 150 ns runs,
and the repeat simulations data are presented in the Supporting Information.

5.4 Effect of AgNP on Individual Residues
The protein structure flexibility in the presence of nanoparticles
may affect the drug binding ability of serum albumin. Flexibility
is an intrinsic property of molecules, and therefore we have considered
the parameter ΔRMSFi to gain a comparative
insight into the flexibility of individual protein residues in the
presence and absence of AgNPs.36 It is
defined as 1  where RMSFi is the RMSF of the side chain of the residue i, that without NPs is RMSFinative, and that with NPs is RMSFicomplex. An increase/decrease in the flexibility of residue i is denoted by a positive/negative value of ΔRMSFi.

5.5 Secondary Structure Analysis of HSA
Here, we have calculated the change in the secondary structural content
of the protein in the absence and presence of the NP during the simulation
time using the DSSP tool.66 The secondary
structure is plotted in terms of probability values by the residue
number of the protein.

Apart from the overall secondary structure
of the protein, we are interested to see if the NP has any effect
on the alteration of the secondary structure at the residue level
of the protein. It will help in measuring the structural changes for
individual residues.36 DSSP gives eight
different types of secondary structure elements, but HSA has only
helix (α, π, and 310) and loop (turn, coil,
and bend types). Two scores are defined, which quantify the secondary
structure for residue i: Shelixi and Sloopi. In order to calculate these
scores, we need to determine Nhelix/Ntotal and Nloop/Ntotal wherein Nhelix and Nloop represents the number of frames
in which residue i adopts a helix-and-loop type of
secondary structure and Ntotal represents
the total number of selected frames in the trajectories at regular
intervals. Nhelix/Ntotal and Nloop/Ntotal is equal to Shelixi and Sloopi, respectively, for each residue i. Shelixi and Sloopi measure the frequency of the secondary-structure type (helix and
loop) for residue i during the simulation time.36

These two scores shall be utilized in the quantification of ΔSeci. It is the maximum change in the secondary
structure of residue i of the HSA when it binds with
the AgNP.36 2  where f =
helix and loop.

Here, Sif(conjugate) and Sif(native) represent the secondary
structure scores of residue i in the conjugate and
native structures. ΔSeci provides
two key points of information, that is, the possible change in the
secondary structure in the HSA and which among the two secondary structures
experiences the alteration: helix or loop.

5.6 Nonbonded Contacts
In order to measure
the interaction between the NP and protein, the number of nonbonded
contacts was calculated for all the five complexes. It has been reported
that the nonbonded contacts exist within the range of 5–7 Å.67 We have chosen a cutoff of 6 Å to account
for any nonbonded interaction between the atoms of the protein and
the AgNP. The number of interacting pairs of atoms was defined as
the number of contacts between the protein and nanoparticle. The total
number of nonbonded contacts changes during the course of simulation,
which was used as a parameter to measure the protein–NP interaction.
The number of amino acids of the protein, which comes within a radius
of 6 Å from the silver nanoparticle atoms, was tracked for all
the protein–NP conjugates.

5.7 Protein–AgNP Interaction Energy
In order to quantify the interaction between the protein and AgNP,
we have extracted the average energies from all the simulation trajectories
of AgNP (Enp), protein (Eprotein), and HSA–AgNP (EORN) for each of the five conjugates. The
total energy of the system comprises the sum of the potential and
kinetic energies. The potential energy term contributes toward the
bonded and nonbonded interactions within the system. As our system
of study entails the protein and AgNP, which are nonbonded in nature,
we therefore considered the nonbonded energy component along with
the total energy to understand the system’s stability. The
nonbonded energy is the sum of the van der Waals and Coulombic energies.
Herein, three energy terms, which contribute significantly toward
the system interaction, were considered: short-range (SR) Coulombic,
potential, and total energies. The interaction energy (ΔE) is calculated as the difference in energy of the conjugates
(EORN) and the sum of
the energies of the protein (Eprotein)
and AgNP (Enp). 3  where Eprotein and Enp is the average
energy of the protein and nanoparticles for their independent simulations. EORN is the energy of the protein–NP
system in the case of MD simulations of conjugated systems. A negative
value of ΔE shall indicate a stable serum albumin
and silver nanoparticle conjugate.
