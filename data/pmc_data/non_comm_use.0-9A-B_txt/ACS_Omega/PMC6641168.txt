Two-dimensional
perovskite compounds, (RNH3)2PbX4, have attracted much attention as quantum confinement
materials. To achieve suitable orientation and exciton properties
for optical applications, carboxy groups were introduced into the
ammonium cations of two-dimensional perovskite compounds, which formed
dimer structures based on the hydrogen bonding by the carboxy moieties.
This structural organization allowed control of the layer orientation
for favorable solar cells and thermal stability of the perovskites,
while maintaining quantum confinement effects.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic
perovskite compounds have attracted significant
attention since their initial application in photovoltaic devices
by Miyasaka et al. in 2009.1 As research
into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has progressed over the last several
years and new methods of fabricating perovskite layers and devices
have been developed, the power conversion efficiency values of PSCs
have increased from 3.8% to more than 20%.2−9 Organic–inorganic perovskite compounds are composed of metal
ions, ammonium cations, and halogen anions, and they have the ability
to be applied in the design of various analogues.10−14 Typically, three-dimensional (3D) perovskites with
the general formula AMX3 (A = CH3NH3+, Cs+, CH(NH2)2+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl–, Br–, I–) have been studied
as light harvesters in PSCs due to their outstanding properties, including
high extinction coefficients, moderate band gaps, small exciton-binding
energies, and long exciton- and charge-diffusion lengths.15,16 However, PSCs based on 3D perosvkites have serious problems in terms
of stability, especially in the presence of moisture, because 3D perovskites
are ionic crystals. Therefore, improvements in the stability of PSCs
are necessary. On the other hand, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites
with the general formula A2PbX4 (A = RNH3+; X = Cl–, Br–, I–) are stable against moisture due to the presence
of bulky and hydrophobic organic layers. Focusing on this issue, some
groups have recently reported the application of 2D perovskite compounds
and their analogues that have improved resistance to moisture.17−23 2D perovskite compounds not only show high moisture stability but
also show exceptional optical properties. Because the bandgap of the
organic layers is much larger than that of the [PbX6]4– octahedra layers (by at least 3 eV), the organic
layers act as insulating barriers, while the inorganic layers behave
as semiconductors. The interfaces between the inorganic and organic
layers are intrinsically flat, and it is thought that excitons are
confined as a result and behave as though they are in an ideal 2D
system.24,25 These stable excitons result in exceptional
optical properties, such as a strong photoluminescence and high optical
nonlinearity, and so organic–inorganic layered perovskites
have the potential for application in a wide range of optical materials.
As reported by Tsai et al.,22 the inorganic
layers of 2D perovskites can act as semiconductors for PCEs when the
2D planes are positioned parallel to the substrate. In this study,
to control the orientation of the 2D perovskites while retaining the
quantum confinement structure, 2D perovskites were prepared using
alkyl ammoniums having carboxy moieties (Figure 1).

carboxy groups.

Results and Discussion
Hydroiodides, HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3I (n = 3, 4, or 7), were obtained
by reacting equivalent amounts of the corresponding amines, HOOC(CH2)n−1NH2, with
hydriodic acid. Perovskite solutions were prepared by reacting stoichiometric
amounts of HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3I with PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Films were prepared on preheated
glass substrates at 100 °C by spin-coating at 2000 rpm. For comparison,
[CH3(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 (n =
3, 4, or 7) spin-coated films were also fabricated by a similar procedure.
From the elemental analysis data of microcrystalline, the compositions
of [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 and [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4, with n values of 4 and 7, were
confirmed.

Figure 2 shows the
out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns generated by spin-coated
films of [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 and [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4, with n values of 3, 4, or
7. A series of diffractions corresponding to the interlayer spacing
is clearly observed for each of the samples. On the basis of the diffraction
peaks, the long cell dimensions along the c-axis
were calculated to be 15.6 Å (n = 3), 12.1 Å
(n = 4), and 18.7 Å (n = 7)
for [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4. Similarly, the d-spacing values for [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 were found
to be 12.5 Å (n = 3), 13.8 Å (n = 4), and 18.4 Å (n = 7), respectively. As
for alkylammonium-based perovskites, the variation in the interlayer d-spacing as a function of n was linear
and was also consistent with our previous data.11 In addition, for specimens containing carboxy groups, the d-spacings at n = 4 and 7 were similar
to those in the alkyl group samples. This result suggests the formation
of layered perovskite structures with the formula [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 (n = 4 or 7), as shown in Figure 1. However, the data
for n = 3 deviate from the trend suggested by the d-spacing values for the n = 4 and 7 films
(Figure S1). The relatively large d-spacing of the n = 3 material suggests
that this specimen had a different structure from that of the 2D perovskites.

Figure 2 Out-of-plane
XRD patterns of spin-coated films of (a) [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 and (b) [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4, with n = 3, 4, or 7.

The orientations of the 2D structures were investigated by
grazing
incident in-plane XRD, and Figure 3 presents the in-plane XRD patterns of spin-coated
films of [HOOC(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 and [CH3(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4. The [CH3(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 film generated
a diffraction peak attributed to the [PbI6]4– octahedra at 14.4° (d = 6.2 Å), even
though the corresponding peak was not present in the out-of-plane
XRD pattern. These results suggest that the 2D inorganic layers were
oriented completely parallel to the substrate in the [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 (n = 7) spin-coated
film. In contrast, in the case of the [HOOC(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 film, a diffraction peak
at 4.4° corresponding to the interlayer d-spacing
was observed in addition to a peak at 14.3°, ascribed to the
[PbI6]4– octahedra. This peak indicates
that a 2D perovskite layered structure was formed and that the crystalline
growth was partly perpendicular to the film surface. This perpendicular
crystalline growth is well suited to photovoltaic applications because
it allows charges to migrate within the perovskite layers without
disturbance. The [HOOC(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 film also generated a ring of X-ray scattering
2D wide-angle X-ray scattering data, attributed to inorganic layers
oriented randomly to the substrate.

Figure 3 In-plane XRD patterns of films of (a)
[HOOC(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 and (b) [CH3(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies of these
perovskites
were undertaken to investigate their structural transitions. Figure 4 shows the DSC profiles obtained from [HOOC(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 and [CH3(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 crystals prepared by precipitation, using DMF as the good
solvent and dichloromethane as the poor solvent. Whereas the [CH3(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 crystals showed phase transitions at −1.6, 12.3, and
35.9 °C, no transition peaks were generated by [HOOC(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4. Mercier26 has suggested that 2D perovskite compounds composed
of ammonium cations with carboxy groups form dimer structures through
hydrogen bonds associated with the carboxy groups. The results of
the FT-IR measurements showed that the peaks of the C–O stretching
vibration around 1720 cm–1 and the N–H deformation
vibration around 1570 cm–1 were observed strongly
for [HOOC(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 compared with HOOC(CH2)6NH3I. From these results, the hydrogen-bond interactions between the
carboxylic acid moieties and ammonium ions hinder the motion of the
organic amines between the inorganic layers and thus inhibit phase
transition.

Figure 4 DSC profiles of (a) [HOOC(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 and (b) [CH3(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 crystals
obtained during the second heating.

Figure 5 presents
the UV–vis absorption spectra of spin-coated
films of [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 and [CH3(CH2)n–1NH3]2PbI4 (n = 3, 4, or
7). Exciton absorption peaks attributed to 2D quantum confinement
structures were generated at approximately 500 nm by all [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 films. The absorbance at this wavelength
was increased upon increasing the chain length, n, suggesting the formation of stable excitons in the perovskites
as the result of a suitable barrier layer thickness. In contrast,
the [HOOC(CH2)2NH3]2PbI4 spin-coated film did not exhibit exciton absorption, presumably
as a consequence of its different structure. The [HOOC(CH2)n–1NH3]2PbI4 (n = 4 or 7) films produced exciton
absorption peaks at 505 and 502 nm, respectively.

Figure 5 UV–vis absorption
spectra of spin-coated films of (a) [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3]2PbI4 and (b) [CH3(CH2)n–1NH3]2PbI4.

Therefore, the quantum confinement
effects that are a feature of
2D perovskite compounds were expressed despite the introduction of
carboxy groups.

Conclusions
Two-dimensional perovskite
compounds incorporating ammonium cations
with carboxy groups were fabricated and found to form dimer structures
based on the hydrogen bonds of the carboxy moieties. Films of these
compounds were randomly oriented with respect to the substrate. In
addition, the thermal stabilities of these materials were increased
due to inhibition of the phase transitions of organic layers upon
introduction of carboxy groups. The length of the acid chains can
be varied, and this has a direct impact on the exciton formation exhibiting
quantum confinement effects.

Experimental Section
Materials
Hydroiodic
acid (HI, 57 wt % aqueous solution)
and DMF (super dehydrated) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd and used as received. Dichloromethane was purchased
from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from
Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Amine hydroiodides, HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3I and
CH3(CH2)n−1NH3I, with n = 3, 4, and 7, were synthesized
by neutralizing HOOC(CH2)n−1NH2 and CH3(CH2)n−1NH2 (n = 3, 4, and 7)
with stoichiometric amounts of HI, respectively.

Sample Preparation
HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3I and PbI2 were
dissolved in DMF at 50 °C for 1 h to obtain precursor solutions
for the preparation of [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3I]2PbI4. The concentrations
of these solutions were 40 wt % (for XRD measurements) and 10 wt %
(for UV–vis absorption spectroscopy measurements). Similarly,
the precursor solutions of [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3I]2PbI4 were obtained. Films were fabricated on preheated hydrophilic substrates
by spin-coating at 2000 rpm using a Mikasa spin coater 1H-D7. The
substrates were heated at ca. 100 °C during the spin-coating
process to obtain high-quality films due to the high boiling point
of DMF. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by pouring the precursor
solutions into dichloromethane. After vacuum drying, orange (n = 4, 7) and yellow (n = 3) powders were
obtained for [HOOC(CH2)n−1NH3I]2PbI4 and [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3I]2PbI4.

Characterization
Optical absorption
spectra of the
spin-coated films were recorded with a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(UV-3100PC; Shimadzu) at room temperature. XRD patterns were obtained
over a 2θ range of 1.5–35° with an X-ray diffractometer
(SmartLab; Rigaku) in conjunction with a Ni-filtered copper Kα
target, operating at 45 kV and 200 mA. DSC was performed using DSC
7200 (Hitachi) under a nitrogen flow of 40 mL min–1.
