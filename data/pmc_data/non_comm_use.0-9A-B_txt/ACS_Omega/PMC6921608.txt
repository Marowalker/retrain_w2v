Dual-gate thin-film transistors (DGTFTs) have attracted
increasing
attention in the past few years because of threshold voltage modulation
and device logic functionality. Here, solution-processed chitosan-based
proton conductors are used as the gate dielectric. The threshold voltage
shift depends on the ratio of the capacitances of the two gate dielectrics.
The second interesting application of DGTFTs is logic functionality.
This device demonstrates AND logic function controlled by applying
either 0 or −1 V to each of the gate electrodes. When both
gates were simultaneously applied to be 0 V, the current flows (ON).
Otherwise, the current is blocked (OFF). In order to provide a comprehensive
overview of these paper devices, the planarization of paper surface
and switching stability of such DGTFTs are all discussed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In 1981, one of the first
dual-gate thin-film transistors (DGTFTs)
based on CdSe was reported by Luo et al.1 From then on, many kinds of DGTFTs were reported.2−5 The advantages of DGTFTs reported
by many researchers are steeper subthreshold slope and increased gate
modulation. The second gate electrostatically modifies the charge
carrier distribution in the channel accumulated by the first gate,
so the second gate can set threshold voltage (Vth) accurately.2 The threshold voltage
can be set as a function of the applied biases, and the effective
threshold voltage shift depends on the ratio of the capacitances of
the two gate dielectrics. Besides setting the threshold voltage to
modulate the operation mode of DGTFTs, such devices are demonstrated
as AND gates. Several circuit applications of utilizing DGTFTs have
already been reported;2,6 however, it does not make full
use of the special advantages of DGTFTs. Numerous logic circuits which
are widely used in devices require multiple inputs, while this functionality
can be achieved by using a single DGTFT. Hence, the number of transistors
required in many digital applications is reduced and the circuits
are simplified. These advantages can be used to realize new functional
devices.

Recently, a new kind of transistor, called junctionless
transistor,
has been reported.7−9 In this paper, all the channel and source/drain electrodes
of such junctionless DGTFTs are realized by a thin indium tin oxide
(ITO) film without any source/drain junction formation. Such a junctionless
paper transistor shows high promise for future electronics application
because of simple device process and low-cost paper substrates. Paper
is an intriguing alternative to fulfill low-cost demand because it
is ubiquitous in daily life and the cheapest flexible substrate. Moreover,
paper is also environmentally friendly because it is recyclable and
made of renewable raw materials.10 However,
the paper surface is rough and porous; until now, it is still a challenging
test to fabricate TFTs on the paper substrate. To solve this problem,
the SiO2 film is used as a buffer layer to realize planarization
of paper surface, which has been discussed in our previous paper.11 TFTs on paper substrates with higher than 10
V operation voltage have been reported by several groups;12,13 however, the device performance and stability are still far from
satisfaction to be used for portable applications. Thus, to fabricate
a low-voltage paper TFT, novel gate dielectric materials that offer
both high gate-specific capacitance and low-temperature processability
are in high demand. Recently, polymer electrolytes14 and inorganic nanogranular electrolytes15 with huge electric double layer (EDL) capacitances have
been reported. In this paper, solution-processed chitosan films with
huge EDL gate-specific capacitance are used as the gate dielectric
layers. The major advantage of the EDL effect in chitosan dielectric
is that the specific capacitance is extremely large at low frequencies,
so that a small gate voltage variation (∼1.5 V) could induce
several orders of magnitudes’ change in the drain current.

2 Results and Discussion
The schematic
diagram of the proposed junctionless dual in-plane-gate
paper TFTs is shown in Figure 1a. The capacitance of DGTFTs can be coupled by the bottom
ITO layer has been reported by our previous work.16 As shown in Figure 1b, three capacitors (C1, C2, and C3) are coupled by the bottom
ITO layer (G1), and the operation mechanism of such DGTFTs is demonstrated
by the equivalent circuit. Thus, the channel current IDS controlled by one gate electrode (G2) can be modulated
by the other gate electrode (G3). In order to understand the operation
mechanism of the junctionless dual in-plane-gate paper TFTs, the specific
capacitance of chitosan dielectric is measured. As shown in Figure 1c, when decreasing
frequency, the capacitance of chitosan dielectric increases and reaches
to 3.7 μF/cm2 at 20 Hz. The gate leakage current
is shown in Figure 1d, and an ultralow leakage current (<80 pA) was observed.

Figure 2a shows
the transfer curves of such junctionless DGTFTs with different channel
thicknesses (TITO = 5, 20, 40, and 60
nm) at a fixed VDS = 1.5 V. The bottom
gate (G1) has no modulation effect on the channel current (IDS) when TITO =
5, 40, and 60 nm. However, the bottom gate shows effective modulation
effect on the channel current when TITO = 20 nm. The subthreshold swing (S) and current on/off ratio (Ion/off) were calculated to be 0.12 V/dec and
5.8 × 106, respectively. The channel length is 1 mm,
the channel width is 0.15 mm, the specific capacitance of chitosan
dielectric is 3.7 μF/cm2, IDS = 7 μA at VG1 = 1.5 V
and Vth = 0.1 V, according to the equation
of IDS = (WCiμ/2L)(VG1 – Vth)2, and the field-effect mobility
(μsat) is calculated to be 12.8 cm2/Vs. Figure 2b shows the output
curves of such junctionless DGTFTs with 20 nm channel thickness, and
the bottom gate voltage increased from −0.5 to 1.5 V. It reveals
excellent linear characteristics at low drain/source voltage and good
current saturation behaviors at high drain/source voltage. The transfer
characteristics with a constant VDS of
1.5 V of such junctionless DGTFTs is shown in Figure 3a, which shows that the transfer curves would
shift from negative direction to positive direction when the secondary
gate voltage decreased from 2.0 to −2.0 V.

DGTFTs on paper substrates with various
channel thicknesses (TITO = 5, 20, 40,
and 60 nm) at VDS = 1.5 V. (b) IDS–VDS curve

substrates with VG3 ranging from 2 to
−2 V. (b) (IDS)1/2 vs VG3 curves.

The threshold voltage (Vth) of such
junctionless DGTFTs on paper substrates is shown in Figure 3b. The Vth of such junctionless DGTFTs would change from −0.53
to 0.97 V when the secondary gate (VG3) voltage decrease from 2.0 to −2.0 V, so the operation mode
of such junctionless DGTFTs change from depletion to enhancement.
The threshold voltage (Vth) modulation
effect of the secondary gate (G3) voltage could be explained as follows.
The channel would be more conducting when a positive voltage was applied
on the secondary gate (G3), so a negative voltage has to be applied
on the first gate (G2) to modulate the channel current, which makes
the subthreshold voltage shift to negative direction.17 Otherwise, the channel would be depleted when a negative
voltage was applied on the secondary gate (G3), so a positive voltage
has to be applied on the first gate (G2) to modulate the channel current,
which makes the subthreshold voltage shift to positive direction.17

When the secondary gate (G3) voltage changes
from 2.0 to −2.0
V and the first gate (G2) voltage is a constant value of 0 V, the
circuit model shown in Figure 1b could be equivalent to the combination of C3 and a parallel
capacitance (C1 and C2). If considering the width of gate electrodes,
the values of these three capacitances should be approximately equal
(C1 ≈ C2 ≈ C3). The voltage change ratio between the
bottom gate (G1) and the secondary gate (G3) should be equivalent
to C3/[C3 + (C1 + C2)] = 1:3, which is consistent with the experimental
data [0.97 – (−0.53)]/[2 – (−2)] = 1:2.7.
Because of the sensitivity of Vth to the
secondary gate (G3) voltage,18 such junctionless
DGTFTs are very potential for sensor applications based on ion-sensitive
thin-film transistors. In this paper, the values of C1 and C2 are
changeable at different secondary gate (G3) voltages, which lead to
the asymmetric shift behavior of threshold voltage (Vth). The gate electrodes would be highly conducting when
a positive voltage was applied on the secondary gate (G3); at this
time, C1 and C2 were equivalent to the huge specific EDL capacitance
of chitosan dielectric. However, C1 and C2 would be smaller because
of the depletion effect caused by the negative voltage applied on
the secondary gate (G3), so a negative secondary gate voltage would
lead to a larger shift of threshold voltage (Vth) based on this equation of ΔVth = ΔVG3C3/[C3 + (C1 + C2)].

The threshold voltage and current on/off ratio are shown in Figure 4a, where the threshold
voltage decreases with increasing secondary gate (G3) voltage. However,
the current on/off ratio remains constant at different secondary gate
(G3) voltages. The field-effect mobilities and subthreshold swings
are shown in Figure 4b, where the field-effect mobility decreases from 1.54 to 1.04 cm2/Vs when the secondary gate (G3) voltage decreases from 2.0
to −2.0 V. However, the subthreshold swing remains a constant
at different secondary gate (G3) voltages, which indicates that the
subthreshold swing was hardly affected by the secondary gate (G3)
voltage.

Figure 4 (a) Vth and Ion/off ratio of such DGTFTs on paper substrates at different VG3. (b) μ and S of such DGTFTs on paper
substrates at different VG3.

In order to find out whether electrochemical doping
existed in
the ITO channel layer during the fabrication process, low-frequency
pulse respond characteristic is shown in Figure 5a. The current on/off ratio remains a constant
of ∼107 without on current decrease, which indicates
that no chemical doping or chemical reaction occurs at the chitosan/ITO
interface because IDS would decrease after
gate scanning when chemical doping or chemical reaction occurred.19 To demonstrate the logic function of such junctionless
DGTFTs, different voltage pulse sequences were applied on the dual
in-plane gates used as inputs and the drain/source current IDS used as the output, which are shown in Figure 5b, where −1
and 0 V are defined as the low and high levels for the input, respectively.
When the high level (0 V) was applied on the dual in-plane gates at
the same time, the drain/source current flows, which means the device
is ON. Otherwise, the drain/source current is blocked, which means
the device is OFF. This is exactly AND logic function, and the current
on/off ratio remains a constant of ∼106 without
on current decrease.

device with VG2 = −0.5 to 1.5 V, VG3 = 0 V, and VDS = 1.5 V.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, the dual-input
AND logic gate based on a single
DGTFT was experimentally demonstrated. The dual-gate electrostatic
modulation and low-voltage operation mechanism of the junctionless
DGTFTs on paper substrates were studied. The threshold voltage of
such junctionless DGTFTs could be effectively modulated from negative
(−0.53 V) to positive (0.97 V) when the secondary gate (G3)
voltage changed from 2.0 to −2.0 V. Such junctionless DGTFTs
on paper substrates with AND logic function are very potential for
paper sensor applications.

4 Experimental Section
The paper substrates
used for oxide-based TFT arrays were ink-jet
printing papers. Radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition were used for the fabrication of junctionless
paper TFTs gated by solution-processed chitosan dielectrics. The entire
process was performed at room temperature. First, a 2.0 μm microporous
SiO2 film was deposited on paper substrates for surface
passivation, the performance of TFTs can be improved by the smooth
surface and interface of paper substrates.20 Second, a 200 nm ITO film was deposited on passivated paper substrates
by RF magnetron sputtering at 0.5 Pa. Third, the dielectric layer
was fabricated by chitosan solution (2 wt % in acetic acid) and dried
in ambient air. At last, ITO source/drain and dual in-plane gate electrodes
were completed by RF sputtering through a nickel shadow mask. Electrical
characterizations of the junctionless paper TFTs and chitosan dielectric
were performed by an impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294A) and a semiconductor
parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200 SCS).
