In search for selective ligands for
the muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor (MR) subtype M2, the dimeric ligand approach,
that is combining two pharmacophores in one and the same molecule,
was pursued. Different types (agonists, antagonists, orthosteric,
and allosteric) of monomeric MR ligands were combined by various linkers
with a dibenzodiazepinone-type MR antagonist, affording five types
of heterodimeric compounds (“DIBA-xanomeline,” “DIBA-TBPB,”
“DIBA-77-LH-28-1,” “DIBA-propantheline,”
and “DIBA-4-DAMP”), which showed high M2R
affinities (pKi > 8.3). The heterodimeric
ligand UR-SK75 (46) exhibited the highest M2R affinity and selectivity [pKi (M1R–M5R): 8.84, 10.14, 7.88, 8.59, and 7.47].
Two tritium-labeled dimeric derivatives (“DIBA-xanomeline”-type:
[3H]UR-SK71 ([3H]44) and “DIBA-TBPB”-type:
[3H]UR-SK59 ([3H]64)) were prepared
to investigate their binding modes at hM2R. Saturation-binding
experiments showed that these compounds address the orthosteric binding
site of the M2R. The investigation of the effect of various
allosteric MR modulators [gallamine (13), W84 (14), and LY2119620 (15)] on the equilibrium (13–15) or saturation (14) binding of [3H]64 suggested a competitive mechanism between
[3H]64 and the investigated allosteric ligands,
and consequently a dualsteric binding mode of 64 at the
M2R.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors (MRs) belong to the class A
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and comprise five receptor
subtypes in humans (designated M1R–M5R).1−4 Whereas the M1R, M3R, and M5R receptors
were reported to couple with Gq proteins, the M2R and M4R receptors bind to Gi/o proteins.5 MRs represent interesting drug targets, for instance,
for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.6,7 Because of the high conservation of the orthosteric (acetylcholine)
binding site,8−10 there is lack of highly subtype selective (orthosteric)
ligands, hampering therapeutic approaches such as the treatment of
cognitive decline by centrally acting selective M1R agonists
or M2R antagonists.11 However,
in addition to the orthosteric binding pocket, MRs were reported to
exhibit distinct allosteric binding sites, which are less conserved
and can potentially be exploited to develop subtype selective ligands.12−17 The M2R was the first GPCR described to be subjected
to allosteric modulation,18−20 and several dualsteric M2R ligands (e.g., 7(21) and 10,22,23Figure 1A) and allosteric M2R modulators
(e.g., 13,2014,18 and 15,24,25Figure 1B) were identified.

of the described MR agonists (ACh, CCh, 1, and 2) and antagonists (3–10).
The M2R binding poses of compounds 7 and 10 were reported to overlap in part with the binding pose
of allosteric M2R modulator 14.21,23 (B) Structures of the selected allosteric MR ligands (compounds 11–15). (C) Structures of heterodimeric ligands 16 and 17 as well as homodimeric MR ligands 18 and 19, the latter suggested to exhibit a
dualsteric binding mode at the M2R.23

Dimerization of GPCR ligands can
result in an increased receptor
affinity and improved selectivity.26,27 Bivalent (dimeric)
ligands were described for various GPCRs, such as opioid,28 histamine,29,30 dopamine,31−33 adenosine,33−35 and neuropeptide Y36−38 receptors, not least
to investigate receptor dimerization. Likewise, the design of dualsteric
(bitopic) ligands, that is, hybrid derivatives that simultaneously
address the orthosteric and allosteric sites of one and the same receptor
protomer, represents an approach toward improved subtype selectivity.19,39−42 For example, rationally designed hybrid MR ligands derived from
the orthosteric agonist oxotremorine (2) and hexamethonium-like
allosteric modulators (e.g., compound 16, Figure 1C) showed increased subtype
selectivity compared to 2.43 Similarily, the MR ligand THRX-160209 (compound 17, Figure 1C) was reported to
exhibit a higher M2R affinity and selectivity than the
corresponding monovalent ligands and was suggested to bind to the
M2 receptor in a multivalent manner.44

Pyridobenzodiazepinone derivative 7 and
the structurally
closely related dibenzodiazepinone derivative 8 (Figure 1A) represent tricyclic
M2R-preferring MR antagonists.45,46 Tränkle et al. suggested a dualsteric binding mode of 7 at the M2 receptor,21 and a hybrid ligand formed of 7 and allosteric modulator 14 was reported to show a pronounced positive cooperativity
with 5, pointing at a new way for the development of
allosteric enhancers.47,48

This study was aimed at
the design, synthesis, and pharmacological
evaluation of heterodimeric MR ligands derived from 8, comprising five combinations of 8 with reported orthosteric
or allosteric MR ligands: “8–xanomeline
(1),” “8–TBPB (11),” “8–77-LH-28-1 (12),” “8–4-DAMP (3),” and “8–propantheline (4).” Xanomeline (1) (cf. Figure 1A) is a M1 and M4 receptor preferring MR agonist.49 Compound 11 (cf. Figure 1B) was reported to selectively activate M1 receptors through an allosteric mechanism, as shown by mutagenesis
and molecular pharmacology studies;50−52 in other reports, 11 was described as a bitopic M1R ligand.53 Likewise, compound 12 (cf. Figure 1B) was suggested
to be a bitopic M1R ligand.54 MR antagonists 3 and 4 (cf. Figure 1A) are nonselective orthosteric
MR antagonists with high affinities [Ki (3, M1R–M5R): 0.52–3.80
nM and Ki (4, M1R–M4R): 0.057–0.33 nM].45,55 In addition to the heterodimeric ligands, one monomeric and four
homodimeric ligands derived from xanomeline, one monomeric and two
homodimeric ligands derived from 8, and a monomeric ligand
derived from 11 were prepared as reference compounds.
Furthermore, two radiolabeled heterodimeric ligands (types “8–11” and “8–1”)
were prepared and characterized by saturation binding [including experiments
in the presence of allosteric modulators (Schild-like analysis)],
kinetic investigations, and competition-binding studies.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
Monomeric
reference compound 22 and homodimeric xanomeline-derived
ligand 25 were prepared by N-alkylation of homopiperazine
derivative 21 using bromide 20 [followed
by removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group]
and by alkylation of piperazine
(24) using bromide 23, respectively (Scheme 1). Treatment of amine 26 with octanedioyl dichloride or decanedioyl dichloride in
the presence of triethylamine yielded homodimeric xanomeline-type
compounds 27 and 28, respectively. Likewise,
amidation of terephthalic acid with amine 26, using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDC)/1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBt) as coupling reagent, afforded
homodimeric ligand 29 containing a rigid central linker
moiety. N-alkylation of 21 using bromide 30, followed by removal of the Boc group, afforded TBPB derivative 31 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Xanomeline Derivatives 22, 25, and 27–29 as well as TBPB Derivative 31
Reagents and conditions: (a)
(1) K2CO3, MeCN, microwave 110 °C, 30 min;
(2) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/CH2Cl2 1:4 v/v,
room temperature (rt), 8 h, 66% (22), 20% (31); (b) K2CO3, MeCN, microwave 110 °C,
30 min, 22%; (c) octanedioyl dichloride or decanedioyl dichloride,
triethylamine, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 0 °C/rt, overnight, 39%
(27), 65% (28); (d) terephthalic acid, EDC,
HOBt, dimethylformamide (DMF), rt, overnight, 26%.

The “8–11” type heterodimeric
ligand 34 was prepared by N-alkylation of compound 32 using bromide 33; N-alkylation of 21 using 33, followed by removal of the Boc group yielded
monomeric reference compound 35 (Scheme 2). Likewise, N-alkylation of piperazine derivatives 36 and 37, using bromide 33, gave
the “8–4” type heterodimeric ligands 38 and 39. The “8–1” type heterodimeric ligand 43 was prepared through
N-alkylation of compound 40 by applying a mixture of
bromides 20 and 33, followed by Boc-deprotection
(Scheme 2). Homodimeric
ligand 41,23 obtained as a
“byproduct” (after Boc-deprotection), was isolated as
well. Compound 41 was recently used as an amine precursor
for the preparation of a tritium-labeled homodimeric MR ligand.23 Amine 43 was propionylated to give
congener 44. The “8–1”
type ligand 46 was obtained by N-alkylation of 45 by bromide 33 (Scheme 2). The “8–3”
type heterodimeric ligand 48 and the “8–12” type ligand 50 were synthesized by alkylation
of compound 47 using bromide 33 and by alkylation
of amine 9(22) (cf. Figure 1A) using bromide 49, respectively (Scheme 2). Treatment of 40 with a mixture of bromides 30 and 33, followed by Boc-deprotection, gave
the “8–11” type heterodimeric ligand 51, which contains a rigid homopiperazine moiety in between
the pharmacophores. As in the case of the synthesis of 43, homodimeric “byproduct” 41 was isolated.
Propionylation of 51 gave congener 52 (Scheme 2). Homodimeric ligand 54 was obtained by treating an excess of compound 47 with bromide 53 (Scheme 2). Regarding the syntheses of 43 and 51, it should be mentioned that the respective non-DIBA type
homodimeric ligands, resulting from a double alkylation of 40 with bromides 20 or 30, were formed as
well, but were not isolated because of interference with other impurities
[preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)].

Reagents and conditions: (a)

MeCN, microwave 110 °C, 45 min, 23%.

Amidation of isophthalic acid derivative 57 by applying
a mixture of amines 55 and 56, followed
by Boc-deprotection, afforded heterodimeric ligand 60 and homodimeric ligand 58 (Scheme 3). Propionylation of 58 and 60 gave congeners 59 and 61, respectively.
By analogy, heterodimeric ligands 63, 66, 69, and 72 were obtained by amidation
of 57 using the amine mixtures 55/62, 55/65, 55/68, and 55/71, respectively, and
subsequent Boc-deprotection (Scheme 3). Propionylation of 63, 66, and 69 at the central linker moiety afforded propionamide
congeners 64, 67, and 70. It
should be noted that the respective non-DIBA type homodimeric ligands,
generated by double amidation of 57 with amines 56, 62, 65, 68, or 71, were formed but were not isolated (cf. Scheme 3).

b Slope different from unity
(P < 0.05).

All compounds containing a dibenzodiazepinone moiety showed high
M2R affinity (pKi > 8.3).
Whereas
homodimeric derivatives (25, 27–29) of MR agonist 1 exhibited an increased M2R affinity (pKi > 7.7) compared to
the
parent compound (pKi of 1: 6.55, see Table 3); the opposite was found in the case of MR antagonist 3 [pKi = 7.09 ± 0.04, mean ±
standard error of the mean (SEM) from two independent experiments]
and a homodimeric derivative of 3 (compound 54, pKi = 6.05, Table 1). The “8–1”
type heterodimeric ligand 46 displayed the highest M2R affinity (pKi = 10.14, Table 1). Steep curve slopes
(≤−1.79) were observed for 43, 51, 60, 61, 64, 67, and 70, indicating a complex mechanism of binding
(e.g., the involvement of more than one binding site).

2.2.2 MR Receptor Subtype Selectivity
Selected dibenzodiazepinone-type
heterodimeric ligands (34, 38, 39, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 61, 64, 67, 70, and 72) and monomeric dibenzodiazepinone
derivative 35, containing
an amino-functionalized homopiperazine moiety, were also investigated
by equilibrium competition binding at the MR subtypes M1, M3, M4, and M5 with [3H]5 as the radioligand (Table 1). For all compounds, there was a preference
for the M2R. Except for 38, the M1R and M4R affinities were higher than the M3R and M5R affinities, that is, the selectivity profile
was M2 > M1 ≈ M4 > M3/M5 (34, 39, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 61, 64, 67, 70, and 72) and M2 > M1 ≈
M5 > M3 > M4 in the case of 38 (Table 1). Compound 46, showing the highest M2R affinity
among the studied MR ligands, exhibited a more pronounced M2R selectivity than the pyridobenzodiazepinone-type ligand 7 (cf. Figure 1A),45 the MR antagonist tripitramine56 containing three pyridobenzodiazepinone moieties, as well
as the recently reported dibenzodiazepinone derivatives 10 and 19 (cf. Figure 1C).23 Displacement of [3H]5 by 46 as well as by heterodimeric
ligands 44 and 64, which were prepared as
tritiated ligands (see below), from MxRs (determined at CHO-hMxR cells, x = 1–5) is illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Displacement of [3H]5 [c = 0.2 nM (M1, M2, M3), 0.1 nM (M4), or 0.3 nM (M5)] by heterodimeric
ligands 44 (A), 46 (B), and 64 (C) from
MxRs determined at intact CHO-hMxR cells (x = 1–5). Data represent
mean values ± SEM from at least three independent experiments
(performed in triplicate).

2.3 Effect on IP1 Accumulation
As previously
reported for homodimeric dibenzodiazepinone derivative 19,23 the homodimeric xanomeline-type ligand 25 and the heterodimeric dibenzodiazepinone-type ligands 44, 46, and 64 were investigated
with respect to M2R agonism and antagonism in an IP accumulation
assay (Figure 3). Like 19, compounds 44, 46, and 64 did not induce an IP1 accumulation when investigated in
the agonist mode (Figure 3A), but completely suppressed the effect of CCh when studied
in the antagonist mode (Figure 3B), revealing that the combination of the agonist xanomeline
(1) with a dibenzodiazepinone-type antagonist in one
molecule (e.g., 44) resulted in a loss of agonistic activity.
Interestingly, homodimeric ligand 25, which is derived
from MR agonist 1, proved to be a M2R antagonist
in contrast to parent compound 1 (Figure 3). The pKb values
of 44, 46, and 64 (cf. Figure 3B) were lower compared
to the respective pKi values (cf. Table 1), as previously observed
for homodimeric ligand 19.23 Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed elsewhere.23

mean values ± SEM from at least seven (CCh and 1) or at least two (25, 44, 46, and 64) independent experiments (each performed in
triplicate). (B) Concentration-dependent inhibition of the IP1 accumulation

SEM from at least five independent experiments (each performed in
duplicate).

2.4 Synthesis
of the Radiolabeled Ligands [3H]44 and [3H]64
Aiming at a radiolabeled derivative
of heterodimeric ligand 46, which exhibited the highest
M2R affinity and
selectivity (cf. Table 1), compound 44, containing a propionamido-substituted
homopiperazine moiety instead of the piperazine ring in 46 (cf. Scheme 2), was
prepared as a tritiated derivative from amine precursor 43 and commercially available [3H]42 (Figure 4A). Additionally,
the tritiated derivative of heterodimeric ligand 64 was
prepared from 63 and [3H]42 (Figure 4A). The chemical
stabilities of the “cold” analogues 44 and 64 were investigated under assaylike conditions [phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) pH 7.4] for over 48 h. 44 and 64 proved to be stable under these conditions (cf. SI Figure 1, Supporting Information). [3H]44 and [3H]64 were obtained in high
radiochemical purities (98% and 99%, respectively; Figure 4B,D) and showed a high ([3H]44) and excellent ([3H]64) stability when stored in ethanol at −20 °C (cf. Figure 4C,E).

in the Supporting Information.

2.5 Characterization of [3H]44 and [3H]64
Saturation-binding experiments
with [3H]44 and [3H]64 at intact CHO-hM2R cells or CHO-hM2R cell
homogenates yielded monophasic saturation isotherms (Figure 5). As previously reported for
[3H]19,23 the extent
of unspecific binding strongly depended on the assay conditions: in
the case of experiments performed at intact adherent cells (white/transparent
96-well plates), unspecific binding was considerably higher compared
to experiments performed at cell homogenates, which preclude the unspecific
binding of the radioligand to the microplate (Figure 5).23 The apparent Kd values amounted to 1.0 and 0.081 nM (cell
homogenates, Table 2). As orthosteric antagonist 6 (used to determine unspecific
binding) completely prevented hyperbolic (monophasic) binding of the
radioligands to the M2R, these experiments proved that
[3H]44 and [3H]64 bind
to the orthosteric binding site of the M2R, as previously
reported for [3H]19.23

binding (blue solid line) was determined in the presence of MR antagonist 6 (500-fold excess). Experiments were performed in triplicate.
The error bars of specific binding and error bars in the Scatchard
plots represent propagated errors calculated according to the Gaussian
law of errors. The error bars of total and unspecific binding represent

The association of [3H]44 and [3H]64 with the human M2R was monophasic and
yielded similar kon values (Figure 6A,C, Table 2). Whereas the “8–1” type heterodimeric ligand [3H]44 dissociated completely from the M2R (t1/2 = 47 min, cf. Figure 6B, Table 2), the dissociation of the “8–11”
type dimeric ligand [3H]64 was incomplete,
reaching a plateau at approximately 47% of initially M2R-bound [3H]64 (t1/2 = 35 min, cf. Figure 6D, Table 2). An incomplete
ligand dissociation, which might be attributed to conformational adjustments
of the receptor upon ligand binding57 or
an enhanced rebinding capability of the dimeric ligand,58 was also reported for the homodimeric dibenzodiazepinone-type
ligand [3H]19.23 The kinetically derived dissociation constants of both [3H]44 and [3H]64 [Kd(kin): 0.33 and 0.057 nM, respectively] were in good
accordance with the Kd values obtained
from the saturation-binding experiments (Table 2).

2.6 Competition
Binding at the M2R
Using [3H]44 and [3H]64 as Radioligands
Heterodimeric radioligands [3H]44 and [3H]64 were applied
to equilibrium competition-binding experiments at CHO-hM2R cell homogenates involving various reported orthosteric, dualsteric,
and allosteric MR ligands. Orthosteric MR antagonist 6, dualsteric ligand 10, and allosteric modulator 14 (cf. Figure 1) were capable of totally displacing [3H]44 from the M2R (SI Figure 2A, Supporting Information), indicating either a competitive mechanism or
a strongly negative cooperativity between dimeric ligand [3H]44 and 6, 10, or 14. Likewise, orthosteric ligands 1 and 6, dualsteric ligands 7 and 10, as well
as allosteric modulators 13–15 (cf. Figure 1) completely displaced [3H]64 from the M2R-specific binding
sites. (SI Figure 2B, Supporting Information). For most of the investigated MR ligands, the respective pKi values were in good agreement with the binding
data obtained from competition binding with [3H]5 (Table 3). However, the pKi values
of compounds 1, 6, 7, and 10, determined in the presence of [3H]64, were consistently lower (up to 1 log unit in the case of 7) than pKi values from the competition-binding
experiments with [3H]5. This is in agreement
with the (in part) irreversible M2R binding of [3H]64 (cf. Figure 6D), which compromises its use as a molecular tool for the
determination of binding constants of nonlabeled ligands, as was also
reported for homodimeric MR ligand [3H]19.23

2.7 Schild-like Analysis with
[3H]64 and Allosteric M2R Modulator 14
To further explore the binding mode of heterodimeric
ligand 64 at the M2R, saturation-binding experiments
were
performed with [3H]64 in the presence of increasing
concentrations of allosteric M2R ligand 14 (Figure 7), as recently
reported for homodimeric radioligand [3H]19.23 As in the case of [3H]19,23 this Schild-like analysis
resulted in rightward-shifted saturation isotherms of [3H]64 (Figure 7A) and a linear Schild plot with a slope not different from
unity (Figure 7B),
which is consistent with a competitive mechanism between [3H]64 and allosteric M2R ligand 14. With regard to the fact that [3H]64 binds
to the orthosteric binding site of the M2R (see above),
these results strongly support a dualsteric binding mode of 64 at the human M2R. The “pA2” value of 7.16, obtained for 14 from
the Schild regression (Figure 7B), was in accordance with the reported M2R binding
data of 14 (pKX 7.5059).

Figure 7 Effect of allosteric M2R modulator 14 on
the saturation binding of [3H]64 determined
at CHO-hM2R cell homogenates at 22 °C. (A) Isotherms

not different from unity [P > 0.5, based on the
slope
mean value ± SEM (0.99 ± 0.15) from three sets of independent
saturation-binding experiments (performed in triplicate)], suggesting
a competitive interaction between [3H]64 and 14. Data represent mean values ± SEM from three independent
experiments (each performed in triplicate).

3 Conclusions
Linking orthosteric (1, 3, and 4) and allosteric (11 and 12) MR
ligands with a M2R preferring dibenzodiazepinone-type MR
antagonist (8) yielded a series of heterodimeric ligands
(34, 38, 39, 43, 44, 46, 48, 50–52, 60, 61, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 70, and 72). The “8–1”
type dimeric ligand 46 (UR-SK75), containing a piperazine
moiety in the linker, exhibited a higher M2R affinity (pKi 10.14) and selectivity [expressed as the ratio
of Ki values (M1/M2/M3/M4/M5): 23:1:180:29:430] compared
to monomeric (such as 8(46) and 10(22,23)) and homodimeric (e.g., 18(22) and 19(23)) dibenzodiazepinone-type ligands. High M2R affinity of all dibenzodiazepinone-type heterodimeric ligands
(pKi > 8.3, Table 1), as also reported for monomeric dibenzodiazepinone-type
ligands,22 suggested a minor influence
of the second pharmacophore on M2R binding, indicating
that the high M2R affinity of these compounds is mediated
by the “dibenzodiazepinone” pharmacophore, which binds
most likely to the orthosteric binding site of the M2R.
This is supported by the proposed binding mode of 10 and 19 at the M2R,23 by
saturation-binding studies using the radioligands [3H]44 ([3H]UR-SK71) and [3H]64 ([3H]UR-SK59), and by the fact that compounds containing
M1R/M4R selective agonist 1(49) as a second pharmacophore (43, 44, 46, 60, and 61)
proved to be M2R-preferring ligands. Moreover, the prototypical
heterodimeric ligands 44 and 46 were shown
to be M2R antagonists (cf. Figure 3). Concerning the “8–1” type heterodimeric ligands, one can speculate about the
contribution of the pharmacophore of 1 to M2R binding because the homodimeric derivatives of 1 (compounds 25, 27–29) exhibited considerably higher
M2R affinities compared to 1. This work confirms
that dibenzodiazepinone-type MR ligands represent a promising class
of compounds for the development of highly selective M2R ligands with a high receptor affinity based on the dualsteric ligand
approach.

described procedures.

Millipore water was used throughout for
the preparation of buffers and HPLC eluents. If moisture-free conditions
were required, reactions were performed in dried glassware under an
inert atmosphere (argon). Anhydrous THF was obtained by distillation
over sodium, and anhydrous CH2Cl2 was prepared
by distillation over P2O5 after predrying over
CaCl2. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
using aluminum plates coated with silica gel (Merck silica gel 60
F254, thickness 0.2 mm). Spots were detected by ultraviolet
(UV) light (254 or 366 nm) or by staining using 0.3% solution of ninhydrin
in n-butanol (amines) or iodine. Column chromatography
was performed in glass columns on silica gel (Merck silica gel 60,
63–200 μm). Flash chromatography was performed on an
Intelli Flash-310 Flash-Chromatography Workstation (Varian, Darmstadt,
Germany). Polypropylene reaction vessels (1.5 or 2 mL) with a screw
cap (Süd-Laborbedarf, Gauting, Germany) were used for the synthesis
of radioligands ([3H]44 and [3H]64) for small-scale reactions, for the investigation of chemical
stabilities (44 and 64), and for the preparation
and storage of stock solutions. Melting points were measured with
a Büchi 530 (Büchi, Essen, Germany) apparatus and are
uncorrected. Microwave-assisted reactions were performed with an Initiator
2.0 synthesizer (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE 300 (7.05 T), Bruker AVANCE III HD 400 (9.40 T),
or a Bruker AVANCE III HD 600 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic
probe (14.1 T) (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Abbreviations for the
multiplicities of the signals are s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet),
dd (doublet-of-doublet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), and brs (broad-singlet).

performed on a Finnigan SSQ 710A instrument [chemical ionization mass
spectrometry (CI-MS, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). High-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis was performed on an Agilent 6540
UHD Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS system (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA) using an electrospray ionization source. Preparative HPLC
was performed on a system from Knauer (Berlin, Germany) consisting
of two K-1800 pumps and a K-2001 detector. Except for compound 54, a Kinetex-XB C18 column, 5 μm, 250 × 21 mm
(Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) served as the stationary phase
at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. For the purification of 54, a Nucleodur 100-5 C18 column, 5 μm, 250 × 21 mm (Macherey-Nagel,
Düren, Germany) was used as the stationary phase at a flow
rate of 15 mL/min. Mixtures of acetonitrile and 0.1% aq TFA were used
as the mobile phase, and a detection wavelength of 220 nm was used
throughout. Lyophilization of the collected fractions was performed
with an Alpha 2-4 LD apparatus (Martin Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany).
Except for compound 54, analytical HPLC analysis (purity
control) was performed on a system from Merck-Hitachi (Hitachi, Düsseldorf,
Germany) composed of a L-6200-A pump, an AS-2000A autosampler, a L-4000A
UV detector, and a D-6000 interface. A Kinetex-XB C18 column, 5 μm,
250 mm × 4.6 mm (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) was used
as the stationary phase at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Mixtures of
acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% aq TFA (B) were used as the mobile phase
(degassed by helium purging). The following linear gradient was applied:
0–30 min: A/B 5:95–85:15, 30–32 min: 85:15–95:5,
and 32–40 min: 95:5. Detection was performed at 220 nm throughout.
The oven temperature was 30 °C. Analytical HPLC analysis of 54 was performed on a system from Thermo Separation Products
composed of a SN400 controller, a P4000 pump, a degasser (Degassex
DG-4400, Phenomenex), an AS3000 autosampler, and a Spectra Focus ultraviolet–visible
detector. A Eurospher-100 C18 column, 5 μm, 250 × 4 mm
(Knauer, Berlin, Germany) served as reversed-phase (RP) column at
a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Mixtures of acetonitrile (A) and 0.05%
aq TFA (B) were used as the mobile phase (degassed by helium purging).
The oven temperature was set to 30 °C, and detection was performed

Annotation
concerning the NMR spectra (1H, 13C) of the
dibenzodiazepinone derivatives (34, 35, 38, 39, 43, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 58–61, 63, 64, 66, 69, and 72): due to
a slow rotation about the exocyclic amide group on the NMR time scale,
two isomers (ratios provided in the experimental protocols) were evident
in the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra.

4.2 Compound Characterization
Nondescribed
intermediate compounds were characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, HRMS, and melting point (if applicable).
Target compounds were characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, HRMS, and RP-HPLC analysis. In addition, compounds 44 and 64 were analyzed by IR spectroscopy. Purities
determined by analytical RP-HPLC amounted to >95%.

4.3 Investigation of the Chemical Stability
The chemical
stability of 44 and 64 was
investigated in PBS (pH 7.4) at 22 ± 1 °C. The incubation
was started by addition of 10 mM solution of the compounds in dimethylsulfoxide
(1 μL) to PBS (99 μL) to give a final concentration of
100 μM. After 0, 12, and 48 h, an aliquot (20 μL) of the
solution was taken and added to acetonitrile/0.04% aq TFA (1:9 v/v)
(20 μL). An aliquot (20 μL) of the resulting solution
was analyzed by RP-HPLC using a system from Agilent Technologies (composed
of a 1290 Infinity binary pump equipped with a degasser, a 1290 Infinity
autosampler, a 1290 Infinity thermostated column compartment, a 1260
Infinity diode array detector, and a 1260 Infinity fluorescence detector).
A Kinetex-XB C18 column, 2.6 μm, 100 × 3 mm (Phenomenex)
served as the stationary phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The following
linear gradient was applied: 0–20 min: acetonitrile/0.04% aq
TFA 10:90–68:32, 20–22 min: 68:32–95:5, and 22–28
min: 95:5. The detection wavelength was set to 220 nm.

4.4 Cell Culture and Preparation of Cell Homogenates
The
culture conditions of CHO-K9 cells, stably transfected with
the human muscarinic receptors M1–M5 (obtained
from Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center; Rolla, MO), and the preparation
of CHO-hM2R cell homogenates are described elsewhere.23

4.5 IP1 Accumulation Assay
The IP1 accumulation
assay was performed as described elsewhere.23

4.6 Radioligand Binding
Equilibrium competition-binding
experiments with [3H]5 were performed at intact
CHO-hMxR cells (x = 1–5)
as described previously,22 but the total
volume per well was 200 μL, that is, in the case of total binding,
the wells were filled with 180 μL of L15 medium followed by
addition of L15 medium (20 μL) containing [3H]5 (10-fold concentrated). To determine the unspecific binding
and the effect of a compound of interest on the equilibrium binding
[3H]5, the wells were filled with 160 μL
of L15 medium followed by addition of L15 medium (20 μL) containing 6 or the compound of interest (10-fold concentrated) and L15
medium (20 μL) containing [3H]5 (10-fold
concentrated).

Saturation binding with [3H]44 and [3H]64 at intact CHO-hM2R cells was performed in the same manner as saturation-binding
experiments with [3H]522 with minor modifications: unspecific binding was determined
in the presence of 6 (500-fold excess to [3H]44 or [3H]64), and the incubation
period was 2 h.

Saturation and equilibrium competition-binding
experiments with
[3H]44 and [3H]64 at
CHO-hM2R cell homogenates were performed according to the
procedure described for saturation and competition-binding experiments
with [3H]19 at CHO-hM2R cell homogenates,23 using a total volume per well of 200 instead
of 100 μL. The total amount of soluble protein per well was
between 19 and 43 μg. In the case of competition-binding experiments,
the radioligand concentration was 2.0 and 0.3 nM, respectively. To
keep the total volume per well at 200 μL in the case of saturation-binding
experiments performed with [3H]64 in the presence
of 14, the addition of L15 medium (20 μL) containing 14 (10-fold concentrated) was compensated by an equivalent
reduction in the volume of L15 medium added to the wells.

M2R association experiments with [3H]44 and [3H]64 were performed at CHO-hM2R cell homogenates essentially using the procedure described
for saturation-binding experiments with [3H]19 at CHO-hM2R cell homogenates.23 The radioligand concentration was 2 and 0.6 nM, respectively. The
incubation was started in reversed order after different periods of
time (120–1 min). After last addition of the radioligand, homogenates
were collected on filter mats using the Harvester. Unspecific binding
was determined in the presence of 6 (500-fold excess
to the radioligand). For M2R dissociation experiments with
[3H]44 and [3H]64,
performed at CHO-hM2R cell homogenates, the procedure was
essentially the same as for saturation-binding experiments with [3H]19 at CHO-hM2R cell homogenates.23 The preincubation (60 min) of the cell homogenates
with the radioligand ([3H]44: 4 nM, [3H]64: 0.6 nM) was started in reversed order after
different periods of time ([3H]44: between
180 and 1 min and [3H]64: between 150 and
1 min) by addition of L15 medium (10 μL) containing the radioligand
(10-fold concentrated) to the wells preloaded with L15 medium (80
μL) and cell homogenates (10 μL). The dissociation was
started by addition of 10 μL of L15 medium containing 6 (40 and 6 μM, respectively) and was stopped by collection and washing
of the homogenates using the harvester. To determine unspecific binding, 6 (1000-fold excess to the radioligand) was added during the
preincubation step.

4.7 Data Processing
Retention (capacity)
factors were calculated from retention times (tR) according to k = (tR – t0)/t0 (t0 = dead time). Data from
the IP1 accumulation assay and radioligand-binding assays [saturation
binding (including Schild-like analysis), association and dissociation
kinetics, and equilibrium competition binding] were processed as described
previously.23 Statistical significance
(curve slopes) was assessed by a t-test (one-sample,
two-tailed). Propagated errors were calculated according to the Gaussian
law of errors.
