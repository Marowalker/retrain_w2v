Interaction
of molecular transitions of two fluorophores—fluorescein
(FL) and safranin O (SAF)—with the surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) inside a water/sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate
(AOT)/n-heptane reverse micelle (RM) has been studied
using ultraviolet–visible and fluorescence spectroscopies.
Here, we exploit the natural capacity of a RM to act simultaneously
as a template for nanoparticle formation and host the fluorophores.
The fluorophores and reducing agent were loaded together into the
water pool; thereafter, silver salt was added, and subsequently, spectral
modification and size evolution were monitored by steady-state and
time-resolved optical spectroscopy. In the FL–AgNP composite,
the SPR band of AgNPs undergoes a strong red shift. Moreover, significant
modifications of both the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of FL
were found when AgNPs formed inside the RM core. On the contrary,
in the SAF–AgNP composite, no such effect was noticed, and
the composite system retains the original optical characteristics
of their constituents (i.e., both the position of molecular transitions
and SPR maximum remain unchanged). This differential effect has been
rationalized by the dissimilar plasmon–fluorophore coupling
in the two systems, controlled by a combination of spatial distribution
and spectral detuning of the molecular absorption maxima of the dyes
(455 and 530 nm for FL and SAF, respectively) from the SPR band maximum
(∼400 nm) of AgNPs.

1 Introduction
The
collective coherent oscillation of conductive electrons on
the surface of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), known as surface plasmon
resonance (SPR), can induce a large electromagnetic field around NPs
upon irradiation. The enhanced fields may interact strongly with the
molecular transition of a closely spaced molecular fluorophore. The
near-field interaction of the SPR with the molecular transitions may
produce optical properties in the composite, which are entirely different
from their constituents.1 The fluorophore–plasmon
(FP) coupling can induce a large variation in the absorption strength,
fluorescence intensity, and lifetime of the molecular fluorophore.2−4 The FP composites are convenient multifunctional nanoprobes for
optical signal modification,5,6 cellular imaging and
photodynamic therapy,7,8 sensing,9 infrared detection,10 molecular switches,11 and so forth. The field strength of SPR depends
markedly on the size, shape, and local dielectric environment of the
nanostructure.6,12 SPR is reported to generate extinction
cross-section up to 100 times higher than the physical cross-section
of NPs.13 Nanostructures with various morphologies,
for example, thin films,14−16 single nanorod,17 nanorod assemblies,3,5,9 and spherical NPs,2,18,19 have been utilized to form composites with molecular fluorophores.

The essential requirements of an effective FP coupling are close
proximity of the fluorophore to the plasmonic particle and a significant
overlap of the SPR with the absorption or emission spectrum of the
fluorophore. A strong FP coupling is usually characterized by the
appearance of a new hybrid absorption band different from either the
molecular absorption or metal NP SPR extinction spectrum.9,13 The energy of the new state can be effectively tuned by modifying
the spectral overlap or the distance between the dye and metal nanostructures.5,9 Moreover, the presence of a metal nanostructure in the close proximity
of a fluorophore can alter the nonradiative decay rates of the fluorophore
and can change both the fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield (QY).3 Modulation of the QY particularly depends on
the distance between the fluorophore and the nanostructure; at a distance
of a few nanometers (>5 nm) from the NP surface, emission enhancement
is reported, but at very short distances (<5 nm), fluorescence
quenching is usually dominant.3,8,18 Moreover, plasmon can also alter the absorption strength of a molecular
absorber, but this phenomenon requires close proximity of the two
units. Interestingly, both reduction20,21 and enhancement22 of molecular absorption (or molar extinction
coefficient) are reported near metal NPs.

We have chosen two
charged fluorophores—FL and SAF—for
identifying the FP interactions inside the water pool of the water/sodium
dioctylsulfosuccinate (AOT)/n-heptane reverse micelle
(RM). The charged fluorophores are expected to be partitioned preferentially
inside the RM rather than in the continuous nonpolar phase (n-heptane), and they exhibit a significant overlap with
the AgNP SPR (Scheme 1). These fluorophores are extensively used in cellular imaging and
in a number of studies involving FP interactions. Jana and co-workers
showed that FL coupled with polyacrylate-coated hydrophobic spherical
3–6 nm Ag/Au NPs and hydrophilic Au nanorods synthesized using
the Igepal/cyclohexane RM is a robust system for cell imaging and
protein detection. They also reported quenching of fluorescence and
reduction of fluorescence lifetime when FL is attached to the nanostructures.8,23 Similarly, fluorescence quenching of SAF by AgCl NPs inside the
AOT RM is also reported.2 However, some
reports rather claimed a distance-dependent enhancement of QY using
structurally analogous fluorescein isothiocyanate bound to silica-coated
AgNPs.24 Lodeiro et al. showed that FL-functionalized
gold and silver NPs can be effectively used as an optical mercury
chemosensor.25 The binding capacity of
FL with silica was used in the synthesis of highly fluorescent FL–silica
NPs in Brij35 RM solution.26 Moreover,
effective photosensitization of TiO2 by FL in the AOT RM
is also reported in the literature.27

with the Chemical Structure of FL and Safranin O (SAF) Molecules
Interestingly, in spite of
the extensive use of the FL dye in FP
coupling studies, there are several inconsistencies within different
reports available in the literature. Lim et al. claimed 83% emission
quenching when FL interacts with citrate-stabilized AuNPs.28 On the other hand, Ragab et al. reported a 3-fold
emission enhancement when FL interacts with AgNPs synthesized using
the same synthetic protocol of citrate stabilization.29 However, Parkin and co-workers found no interaction of
FL with citrate-capped AuNPs or AgNPs.30 Motivated by these reports and also to obtain further insights,
we designed the present system.

Here, for the first time, we
will show a novel controlled way to
study the FP coupling between the SPR of AgNPs and molecular fluorophores
inside the restricted environment of RMs. We have utilized the natural
capacity of a RM to act simultaneously as a template for NP formation
and to encapsulate the dye. The advantage is that no tricky synthetic
skills, for example, surface attachment, electrostatic interaction,
or immobilization of the molecular species within a dielectric matrix,
are needed to keep the molecule near the NP. However, for an accurate
determination of the FP interaction, still several problems may be
associated, such as the change in the aggregation state of either
the fluorophore or the NP. Thus, the NP–fluorophore system
is hard to compare with the unassociated fluorophore or NP system.
Here, we have used only ∼1 μM of fluorophore, and at
this low dye concentration, aggregation may be ignored. Moreover,
the dye and reagents required to form the NP are added together into
the RM core, and the in situ spectral and size evolutions of the RM
system were continuously monitored to detect any spectral or size
changes occurring at any instance.

2 Results
2.1 Extinction Properties of the FP Composite
Systems
The growth of AgNPs, after dissolution of Ag+ into the water pool of the RM, was monitored by recording
the extinction spectra at different time intervals. Figure 1a shows that the SPR of AgNPs
gradually develops with time; a clear SPR peak at ∼400 nm can
be easily visible after 6 min. With time, the SPR band intensity continues
to grow for ∼18 min, but the SPR peak position remains invariant
(Figure 1d).

Figure 1 Evolution of
the extinction spectra of different systems with time:
(a) AgNPs inside the AOT RM (w0 = 6),
(b) AgNPs and SAF in the RM, and (c) AgNPs and FL in the RM. The variation
of SPR maxima with time for various systems is shown in plot (d).

To study the FP composite systems,
the fluorophore concentration
was kept low (∼1 μM) to ensure that only the monomeric
form of the fluorophore prevails inside the RM. As soon as the silver
ions dissolve into the water pool of the RM containing a fluorophore,
AgNP formation takes place, and FP interaction, if present, may be
observed. Both the systems containing AgNPs only and SAF–AgNP
composites have a similar reduction time of ∼18 min (Figure 1b). The absorption
maxima of SAF were at 533 nm inside the RM both in the absence and
presence of AgNPs. When the SAF absorption spectra in the RM solution
(in the absence of the silver precursor) were subtracted from the
absorption spectra of the AgNP–SAF composite at different times,
a spectral pattern similar to that of the SPR of AgNPs (in the absence
of fluorophore) can be recovered (Figure S1).

In the FL–AgNP composite, the SPR peak also attains
the
maximum at ∼18 min. However, unlike the SAF–AgNP system,
with further progress of the reaction, the SPR band of the FL–AgNP
composite depletes along with a remarkable red shift (Figure 1c). At the initial time (e.g.,
∼6 min), the FL–AgNP conjugate shows several bands at
different wavelengths designated as λ1 (∼402
nm), λ2 (∼456 nm), and λ3 (∼485 nm). These peaks may be assigned as the SPR of AgNP
(λ1) and the monoanionic form of the FL dye (λ2 and λ3).31 These
three peaks persisted for up to ∼18 min (i.e., time needed
to complete the reduction process). The λ1 peak shifting
started at ∼18 min, the shifting process continued upto ∼100
min, and finally, the λ1 peak was shifted by ∼30
nm. Saini et al. reported a similar type of depletion along with the
splitting of AgNP SPR when the chlorine-P6 dye was gradually added
to poly-l-lysine capped AgNPs.18 From the spectral broadening and shifting of the SPR band observed
here, it appears that NPs may undergo aggregation. However, structural
characterization reveals that FL has a trivial effect on the size
and distribution of AgNPs, which will be discussed later in the article.

To represent the FL coupling more effectively, we performed a simple
convolution analysis (Figure 2). We assumed that if there is no interaction between the
SPR and fluorophore, the extinction spectrum of the SPR–fluorophore
composite should be similar in appearance to the sum of the spectra
of the two separate systems. It is evident from Figure 2 that the bands of the composite system do
appear at the same position like that of the individual systems. However,
for the AgNP–FL system, the spectrum of the composite system
does not have a significant similarity with the calculated combined
spectrum. The combined spectrum shows three peaks at ∼430,
∼452, and ∼485 nm, which are close to the peaks of the
AgNPs (400 nm) and FL (455 and 485 nm) alone. The composite system
shows a broad peak at ∼430 nm and very weak shoulders at ∼455
and ∼483 nm, indicating the formation of a very different hybrid
system.

Figure 2 Normalized UV–visible extinction spectra of only AgNPs,
only fluorophore, and the AgNP–fluorophore composite, and the
calculated combined (AgNP + fluorophore) extinction spectrum. SAF
and FL are, respectively, used in the top and bottom panels. The extinction
spectrum of the AgNP–SAF system has a strong similarity with
the combined spectrum, but the extinction spectrum of the AgNP–FL
system deviates much from the calculated spectrum.

Modification of the spectrum can be attributed
to either aggregation
of AgNPs or hybridization of the SPR and molecular absorbance via
FP coupling. Kitching et al. reported modification of the SPR because
of aggregation of AgNPs or AuNPs.30 However,
Wang and other researchers claimed that the FP coupling induced a
spectral modification.5,9 Therefore, we want to check which
of the possibilities is dominant in our system. We want to determine
if there is any change in the size distribution of NPs in the presence
of FL.

2.2 Structural Characterization of AgNPs and the
FL–AgNP Composite System
Figure 3 shows the size distribution of the FL–AgNP
composite at different times when AgNPs gradually form within the
RM. The details of the average size during the growth of the FL–AgNP
composite are available in the Supporting Information (Table S1). For the AOT RM, the hydrodynamic radius of the RM (rh) is correlated with w0 ([water]/[AOT]) as follows32 1  

Figure 3 DLS measurements
of FL–AgNP composites at different times.

Therefore, at w0 = 6, the hydrodynamic
diameter is expected to be ∼8 nm. Our measured hydrodynamic
diameter was found to be 6.9 nm, approximately matching with the expected
diameter. As seen from Figure 3, after 18 min (time needed for the complete reduction of
AgNPs), the hydrodynamic diameter increases from 6.9 to 8.7 nm. The
enlargement of the RM may be due to the formation of AgNPs within
the core of the RM.33 Thereafter, no abrupt
change in the hydrodynamic diameter was observed after a longer time
delay (Table S1), although a minor increase
in the polydispersity was observed after a very long time (∼1000
min). Thus, time-dependent dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements
give a clear indication that the spectral change in the SPR band in
the presence of FL is not merely because of the change in the morphology
of AgNPs. DLS measurements were further augmented by the transmission
electric microscopy (TEM) measurement of the AgNP-containing RMs with
and without FL (Figure S2). Thus, FL has
only a trivial effect on the mean size and distribution of AgNPs.
The average diameter of the AgNPs was found to be 6.1 ± 2.6 and
6.5 ± 3.1 nm, respectively, in the presence and absence of FL.

2.3 Emission Properties of FP Composite Systems
with Time
To check whether the AgNP formation and the corresponding
SPR have any impact on the optical properties of the fluorophore,
we measured the excitation (Figure S3)
and emission (Figure 4) spectra of the fluorophore inside the RM in the absence and presence
of AgNPs. No notable peak shift is observed either for the excitation
or emission spectrum when AgNPs are formed inside the RM. Invariance
of the peak position gives a clear indication of the invariance in
the chemical form of FL and SAF before and after AgNP formation. However,
the emission intensity of FL decreases with the gradual formation
of AgNPs within the RM (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Variation of the steady-state emission intensity of safranin (λex = 510 nm) and FL (λex = 445 nm), in the
presence of growing AgNPs, with time inside the RM solution. The inset
shows the normalized intensity of the respective fluorophore, and
the arrow indicates an increase in the shoulder peak with time.

The fluorescence intensity steadily
decreases up to ∼40
min; thereafter, no appreciable change in quenching was observed.
This can be rationalized on the basis of the fact that during the
growth of AgNPs, the free FL molecule may be adsorbed on the surface
of AgNPs. The attachment process of the dye is further boosted by
the coexistence of both dye and AgNPs inside the confined environment
of RMs. The quenching is more prominent for FL; almost ∼62%
of the initial fluorescence decreases after AgNP formation. The quenching
is almost insignificant (<10%) for SAF in the presence of AgNPs.
The quenching of the fluorescence intensity of FL after AgNP formation
is very apparent when the systems were viewed under a handheld ultraviolet
(UV) lamp (362 nm), but no detectable change was observed for SAF
(Figure S4).

2.4 Time-Resolved
Fluorescence Properties of the
FP Composite
Fluorescence anisotropy decays of FL and SAF
are shown in Figure 5 before and after the complete growth of AgNPs. It is evident that
the anisotropy decay of both the dyes becomes faster upon AgNP formation.
The average rotational correlation time (⟨τr⟩) for FL in RMs is found to be ∼2.46 ns (Table 1). This agrees with
the average rotational time (τr = 2.50 ns) of FL
in AOT RMs at w0 = 7, as observed by Dutt.31 The fluorescence anisotropy decay becomes slightly
faster upon AgNP formation within the RMs (Table 1). This is in accordance with our earlier
report using the anionic C343 probe.34 A
marginal decrease in the rotation time was observed when the system
changed from RMs to AgNP-containing RMs. On the other hand, for SAF,
a substantial decrease in ⟨τr⟩ from
∼3.70 to ∼2.07 ns was observed by changing the system
from RMs to AgNP-RMs.

The very different anisotropy behavior of the two
fluorophores
upon AgNP formation can be rationalized on the basis of different
locations of the fluorophores inside the RM before AgNP formation.
FL mainly remains inside the water pool, whereas SAF predominately
resides at the interfacial region of the RM.31,32 The large change in the anisotropy decay of SAF may be associated
with the marked reorganization of the RM interface upon AgNP formation.
The interface may become less organized upon formation of AgNPs, which
may expose SAF more into the external nonpolar phase. This may increase
the local motion of the fluorophore, resulting in a faster fluorescence
anisotropy decay. Note that the rotational relaxation time of free
SAF in a homogenous solvent is quite fast.35 On the other hand, because FL resides in a water pool, it may have
a minor change in the microenvironment.

Figure 6 shows the
fluorescence decays of both FL and SAF in the RM before and after
the complete growth of AgNPs. The decay of SAF almost remains unaffected
upon NP formation. This is consistent with the negligible change in
the steady-state emission. However, the fluorescence decay of FL becomes
much faster after formation of AgNPs. The decay of FL in RMs can be
fitted with a biexponential function with time constants of 1.20 ns
(16%) and 3.80 ns (84%) (Table 2). Interestingly, in the FL–AgNP system, FL decay becomes
more nonexponential, and a reasonable fit needs at least three exponentials
with components—0.35 ns (34%), 2.71 ns (28%), and 3.9 ns (38%).
The average decay time shortens significantly from 3.40 ns in RMs
to 2.20 ns in AgNP-RMs. For SAF, only a marginal decrease in the average
decay time from 3.00 ns in RMs to 2.78 ns in AgNP-RMs was observed.

b φ = QY.

The radiative
plasmon model proposed by Lakowicz shows that the
presence of metal NPs near the vicinity of the fluorophore can substantially
modify the decay rates of fluorophores.36 Thus, a strong decrease in the FL decay time indicates modification
of either radiative (kr) or nonradiative
(knr) pathways of FL in the presence of
AgNPs. From the QY and excited-state lifetime measurements, kr and knr can be
easily calculated as follows 2   3  where φ
and τ0 are
the QY and lifetime of the fluorophore, respectively. Thus, the observed
radiative (kr) and nonradiative (knr) decay rates of FL in the RM solution are
0.081 and 0.27 ns–1, respectively. Interestingly,
the presence of AgNPs substantially modifies the nonradiative decay
rates (from 0.28 to 0.440 ns–1). Thus, we infer
that the observed changes in the PL emission time is primarily because
of the nonradiative energy transfer from the photoexcited FL to AgNPs.
The nonradiative energy transfer efficiency (η) and the rate
of energy transfer (KET) can be calculated
by using the following equations 4   5  where τD and τDA represent the lifetimes of the donor (FL) in the absence
and presence of the acceptor (AgNPs), respectively. The calculated
energy transfer efficiencies and the energy transfer rate for the
FL–AgNP pair are 36% and ∼1.6 × 108 s–1, respectively (Table 2). For SAF, the energy transfer efficiency and the
energy transfer rate are 9% and 0.3 × 108 s–1, respectively. Thus, the energy transfer can be effectively tuned
by a precise selection of the molecular dye. From the steady-state
and time-resolved data, it is clear that the FL molecule may be located
in the close vicinity of AgNPs. Because the rate of energy transfer
depends on the spectral overlap between the donor and the acceptor
besides the separation distance between the coupling pair, the FL
dye satisfies both the criteria, and hence a high rate of energy transfer
occurs. Conversely, a low rate of energy transfer for the SAF–AgNP
pair can be rationalized on the basis of the fact that SAF is predominantly
present in the interfacial region, and hence the spatial separation
from the AgNPs formed in the core is quite large. In addition, the
spectral overlap also disfavors an effective coupling.

3 Discussion
Our main objective in the present investigation
is to probe the
modification of the absorption and emission characteristics of a molecular
fluorophore induced by the SPR of AgNPs inside the confinement of
AOT RMs. AgNP was chosen as its SPR band shows around 5 times stronger
excitation coefficient than AuNPs; additionally, AgNPs are also known
to exhibit a stronger FP coupling than AuNPs.13,37 Usually, the extent of FP coupling depends on the spectral overlap
and distance between the molecular absorber and the metal NP. Thus,
the two representative pairs, uncoupled (SAF–AgNPs) and coupled
(FL–AgNPs), are produced by a judicious selection of fluorophores.
Steady-state and time-resolved studies revealed that indeed a strong
interaction between FL and AgNPs takes place, but only a trivial interaction
was observed for the SAF–AgNP conjugates.

Usually, the
interaction of the metal NP with a closely placed
molecular absorber occurs via two well-accepted mechanisms: electromagnetic
and chemical. The interaction of the electric field of the surface
plasmons with the absorption or emission transition dipole of the
molecule constitutes the electromagnetic part. On the other hand,
mixing of metal states with electronic states of the molecule is considered
as the chemical mechanism.13,17,36 Interaction with AgNPs does not alter the excitation or emission
maxima of either of the fluorophores, which implies that the energy
levels of the fluorophore remain the same before and after coupling
with the SPR. However, a strong reduction in the emission intensity
and lifetime was noted for FL upon interaction with the NP. These
are in accordance with the electromagnetic influence of the FP coupling.

FL may remain in different chemical forms depending on pH of the
medium. A concern is that ascorbic acid (AA) used as a reducing agent
here may itself change the chemical form or spectral properties of
FL. The effect of AA on the optical characteristics of FL in water
and in the micellar medium has been investigated in detail by De and
Kundu.38 They demonstrated that AA has
a significant effect on the protonation equilibrium of FL in aqueous
medium. In neutral water, FL mainly exists in the dianionic form,
but with the increase in the AA concentration, monoanionic, neutral,
and even cationic forms may dominate at very high concentrations.38 However, they have not reported any redox reaction
of FL in the presence of AgNPs.38 We studied
the effect of AA on FL inside the AOT RMs at w0 = 6 (see the Supporting Information, Figure S5). In the absence of AA, the absorption and excitation
spectra of FL show two peaks of similar strengths at 483 and 455 nm
(Figure S5). This feature is mainly because
of the monoanionic form of FL.31 With the
increase in the AA concentration, the relative contribution of 455
nm peak increases compared to that of the 483 nm peak. In addition,
the fluorescence intensity of FL was also quenched significantly with
the increase in the AA concentration. Our observations imply the gradual
conversion of the monoanionic form of the FL molecule into a neutral
form with increase of AA and is consistent with the observation of
De and Kundu.38Because we used a fixed
concentration (0.1 mM) of AA, we would not expect that the prototropic
equilibrium of AA changes appreciably during the NP synthesis. Formation
of AgNPs takes place at the expense of AA, and therefore AA concentration
gradually decreases but certainly does not increase in the core of
RMs, when AgNPs are formed. This is very clear from the excitation
spectra of FL recorded before and after the AgNP synthesis inside
the RM (Figure S3). We see that the relative
contribution of the 483 nm peak increases very slightly after NP formation.
This implies that the monoanionic form increases only marginally after
AgNP formation.

We can also estimate pH of the medium before
and after NP formation.
Because FL is a pH-sensitive probe, its excitation and fluorescence
spectra may change with the concentration of AA. This may complicate
the observed fluorescence quenching. However, it is well-known that
the water pool of the AOT RM displays a bufferlike behavior. This
means that pH of the internal water pool is relatively insensitive
to the externally added acid or base. A number of studies have been
devoted to study such a bufferlike action of the water pool of RMs.39,40 Using a ratio-metric analysis of the excitation spectrum of FL,
Hasegawa showed that the water pool of AOT RMs behaves as a buffer
for a wide range of bulk pH (2–12).40 We estimated pH of the water pool under different conditions from
the calibration curve obtained from the FL excitation spectra (Figure S6). We found that pH of the medium changes
very slightly (4.8–5.1) in the presence of various additives
such as AA (AA–FL) and AgNPs (AgNP–FL).

The possibility
of aggregation of FL in the presence of AgNPs may
be another important concern. Thus, we deliberately take a very low
concentration of fluorophore (∼1 μM) to avoid any aggregation.
Simple calculation (Supporting Information, Table S2) reveals that the number of RMs is 2–3 orders of
magnitude higher than the number of FL molecules. Thus, it is very
unlikely that two FL molecules may reside in the same RM core to form
aggregates. In addition, the excitation spectrum of FL is very sensitive
to aggregation.38 The invariance of the
excitation peak position of FL before and after AgNP formation further
supported that no aggregation of FL takes place (Supporting Information, Figure S3).

Now, we have to
consider the distribution of NPs and fluorophores
inside the RM system. As residual positive charges may exist on the
AgNP surface, surface attachment with negatively charged FL molecules
is highly probable (Scheme 2). It was reported that the nucleation process for the AgNP
formation inside the RM takes place via Ag4+ clusters that are finally converted into AgNPs.41 Furthermore, invariance of time-resolved anisotropy decays
suggests that FL molecules may not penetrate the AOT surfactant barrier
when AgNPs are formed; in other words, most of the FL molecules are
attached to the AgNP surface. As the residual positive charges on
the AgNP interface are stabilized by the negatively charged capping
agent AOT, after formation of AgNPs inside the RMs, no water pool
practically exists. It is unlikely that the SAF molecule penetrates
the negatively charged surfactant layer and attaches with the AgNP
surface; rather, it may be present in the interfacial region (Scheme 2). Note that the
interfacial region is the place where maximum perturbation is expected
when AgNPs are formed inside the RM core. A significantly faster anisotropy
decay of SAF after AgNP formation may arise from its presence in the
interfacial region. A minor decrease (∼10%) in the QY of SAF
indicates a trivial interaction with the AgNPs, and the reduction
of the QY may be due to the emitted photons reabsorbed by AgNPs by
the inert filter effect. This is also supported by the lifetime measurement,
where no change in fluorescence decays was observed. On the basis
of the above discussion, Scheme 2 was designed showing probable distribution of dyes
and FP interaction of AgNPs inside the AOT RM system.

Scheme 2 Probable
Distribution of Dyes and FP Interaction of AgNPs inside
the AOT RM System
The remarkable modification of the extinction spectrum
of the SPR
band of AgNPs during the progress of the FL–AgNP composite
can be due to the FP coupling,1,13 change of refractive
index around theNPs,9,17,42 or aggregation of NPs.30Because we do
not observe any appreciable difference in the TEM image of the composite
system from that of the AgNPs in the RM, we may exclude the possibility
of aggregation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of nanoscale
aggregation of small AgNPs (say <3 nm) within the RM core induced
by FL because TEM and DLS are not sensitive to these microscopic aggregations.
A strong coupling of the SPR band of the metal NPs with the excitation
state of the fluorophore may generate two new states with upper and
lower energies.1,13 A significant change in the local
refractive index around NPs may occur when a molecular fluorophore
binds to the NP surface.9,17,42 In all of the aforementioned cases, usually a red shift was noticed
in the FP composite system. Because we can only resolve the low-energy
SPR band (at ∼430 nm) but not the high-energy one, we may ascribe
the shift of the SPR to the change in the refractive index. However,
because of significant spectral broadening, we cannot rule out the
presence of a high-energy peak, and hence other possibilities may
also prevail.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have demonstrated an easy and convenient way
to study the in situ FP coupling both by confining the fluorophore
and gradually developing the NPs inside the RMs. For the two fluorophores,
FL and SAF, we observed very different spectral modifications. For
the SAF–AgNP composite, the extinction spectrum was simple
superposition of the SPR band of AgNPs and the absorption spectrum
of SAF. However, for the FL–AgNP composite, the extinction
spectrum modulates strongly; the original SPR band at ∼400
nm depletes strongly, whereas a new peak develops at ∼ 430
nm. However, the absorption, excitation, and emission spectra of FL
do not show any shift of molecular transition frequencies in the presence
of AgNPs. Moreover, TEM and DLS measurements revealed very less morphological
change of the AgNPs in the presence of FL. Thus, the modification
of the extinction spectrum of the SPR band may not be because of the
aggregation of AgNPs but attributed to the FP coupling. In the Fl–AgNP
composite system, quenching of the fluorescence intensity and the
decrease of the lifetime of FL was attributed to the energy transfer
from the fluorophore to the metal NP. The very different spectral
behavior of the FL–AgNPs and SAF–AgNPs was due to a
combination of different FP distance distribution inside the RM and
different spectral detuning of the molecular transitions from the
SPR band of AgNPs.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials Used
FL, SAF, and n-heptane
(UV spectroscopic grade) were purchased from Merck.
AOT (98%), silver nitrate (99.9999%), and l-AA were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals. Millipore water with resistivity (18.2
MΩ cm) was used for all solution preparations. AOT was dried
overnight at 80 °C in an oven before use to remove the adsorbed
moisture. All studies were performed at room temperature (25 °C).

5.2 Preparation of RM Solutions Containing Dyes
RM solution at w0 = 6 (w0 = [water]/[surfactant]) was prepared by adding the requisite
amount of aqueous solution of AA into 0.09 M AOT solution in n-heptane. To incorporate the charged dyes into the RM solution,
the required amount of a stock solution of the fluorophores in ethanol
was spread in a 3 mL glass vial and allowed to evaporate completely.
Then, the residual dyes were redispersed in 3 mL of pure RM solutions.
The concentration of the dyes was kept at ∼1 μM.

5.3 Synthesis of AgNPs inside Dye-Loaded AOT RMs
The synthesis
of AgNPs inside dye-loaded RMs was performed by slight
modification from our earlier works.12,34 First, a stock
solution of silver nitrate in ethanol was made, and the required amount
of the solution was spread in a 5 mL glass vial and allowed to dry
completely by gentle heat. Thereafter, the dye-loaded RM solution
was added to the silver nitrate containing vial and stirred. The overall
concentrations of both AgNO3 and AA were 0.1 mM. Upon addition
of the dye and AA-loaded RM solution, a bright yellow-to-reddish color
develops gradually with time, depicting the formation of AgNPs.

5.4 Instruments Used
Absorption spectra
were measured using a PerkinElmer LAMBDA-750 spectrophotometer and
fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in a Jobin Yvon FluoroMax4
spectrofluorometer. All absorption and emission measurements were
performed using a standard quartz cuvette of 10 mm path length. The
QY measurements were carried out by taking FL in 0.1 M NaOH (QY =
0.95) and SAF in CH3CN (QY = 0.24) (refs (43) and (44)). The QY was calculated
from the equation 6  where Q is the QY, I refers to the integrated fluorescence intensity, A stands for absorbance, and n is the refractive
index of the solvent. The unsubscripted letters and the subscript
“R” represent the sample and reference, respectively.

The time-resolved fluorescence spectra were recorded with a time-correlated
single-photon-counting (TCSPC) setup (HORIBA Instruments) using picosecond
laser diodes, DeltaDiode-405L and 510L, with excitation wavelengths
of 405 and 510 nm, respectively. The full width at half-maximum of
the setup was typically ∼90 ps. The fluorescence decays were
fitted using DAS6 software. The fluorescence decays were recorded
by keeping the analyzer at the magic angle (55°) with respect
to the polarizer. To measure the fluorescence anisotropy decays, the
analyzer was rotated at regular intervals to obtain parallel (I∥) and perpendicular (I⊥) decay components of a fluorescence decay separately.
The anisotropy function, r(t), was
constructed using the expression 7  

The G value of the
setup was determined at 520
nm emission wavelength of FL and was found to be 0.72. Fluorescence
anisotropy decays were also fitted using DAS6 software.

TEM
measurements were carried out in a JEOL JEM 2100 electron microscope
operating at a maximum accelerating voltage of 200 kV. TEM samples
were prepared by spreading a drop of the AgNP dispersion onto a copper
grid coated with carbon. TEM images were analyzed by ImageJ software
with PSAr12 plug-in; the mean and standard deviations were calculated
for 500–600 particles. DLS measurements were carried out in
a Malvern Nano ZS 90 instrument using a 50 mW DPSS laser (λ
= 532 nm) at a 90° scattering angle. The solutions were filtered
with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) syringe filters having 0.2 μm
pore size before the DLS measurements.
