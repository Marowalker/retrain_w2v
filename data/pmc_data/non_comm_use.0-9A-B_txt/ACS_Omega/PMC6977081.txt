Utilization of safe cytotoxic agents with precise anticancer
activity is considered as the prime focus of cancer therapeutics research.
A greater incentive for such agents arises from the molecules/drugs
that are already being used for other indications. Ormeloxifene (ORM)
is a nonsteroidal, nonhormonal selective estrogen receptor modulator
(SERM), which has been in human use for contraception purposes. Although
in the recent past, many reports have suggested its emerging role
as an anticancer agent, no significant attention was paid toward generating
simple and safe nanoformulation(s) for improved therapeutic activity
and tumor cell-specific delivery. Our aim is to develop nanoformulation(s)
of ormeloxifene to improve its targeted delivery in tumor cells. We
developed ormeloxifene nanoformulation(s) by utilizing various biocompatible
polymers. The optimized formulations with pluronic polymers F127 and
F68 show improved nanoparticle characteristics. These formulations
show enhanced cellular uptake that allows ormeloxifene’s intracellular
availability. We further evaluated its improved anticancer activity
by performing cell proliferation, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting
assays. Overall, this study confirms possible novel nanoformulation(s)
of ormeloxifene to be evolved as a new therapeutic modality for cancer
treatment.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer (PanCa) remains the
third leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the United States.1 Often pancreatic
cancer is diagnosed at the locally advanced stage or when it has metastasized
to distant sites due to nonspecific symptoms.2,3 Such
circumstances are likely suitable for chemotherapy. Among many chemotherapies,
5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, gemcitabine plus capecitabine (GemCap),
Abraxane plus gemcitabine, and FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin,
irinotecan. and oxaliplatin or gemcitabine) are commonly administered
to the patients with pancreatic cancer.4−8 These regimens are associated with numerous side effects such as
nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity,
nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity.9 In most
cases, the heterogenic tendency of cancer progression not only promotes
the aggressive nature of cancer cells but also facilitates resistance
to chemotherapy.10

Repurposing of
already existing drugs for a different indication
has become a new attraction for researchers and is a clinically viable
approach. The process of drug repurposing (drug reusing or repositioning)
is a feasible and affordable mechanism to create newer therapeutic
modalities as the safety and toxicity profiles of the drug(s) are
already well-known.11 Ormeloxifene (ORM,
C30H35NO3, a selective estrogen receptor
modulatory molecule) was originally marketed as oral contraceptive
pills in various Asian and African countries for humans.12,13 Recent literature demonstrates its anticancer activity against various
cancers, such as cervical, ovarian, breast, head and neck, pancreatic,
prostate, and chronic myeloid leukemia.14−20 A strong rationale to implement this molecule as an anticancer agent
is based on a clinical study of ORM in 70 female patients, which suggests
∼a 38.7% overall response rate with 6 months treatment.16 Additionally, ormeloxifene administration showed
superior tumor growth inhibition in both rat and mouse models.19,21−23 These compelling evidence and excellent safety profile
of ormeloxifene promote its clinical implications as an anticancer
agent.24

Producing various types
of anticancer nanoparticle formulations25 can be a step closer toward achieving improved
therapeutic benefits. Nanocarriers are utilized heavily for delivery
of drugs also because they do not alter the loaded drug’s activities.26 A number of nanoparticle formulations that have
been in clinic or under evaluation in clinical trials guide us toward
achieving this newer path to treat cancer.27,28 Nanoparticles follow either passive or active targeting mechanisms
to reach and accumulate in tumors, and thus, these can achieve improved
therapeutic benefits.29 Therefore, we hypothesized
that encapsulation of ormeloxifene in polymer matrices would increase
its anticancer activity through increased cellular accumulation, escape
from endosomal and lysosomal degradations, sustained release in the
cytoplasm, and reduced exocytosis. Hence, in the present study, we
report a simple paradigm for the generation of self-assembled polymer/pluronic-ormeloxifene
nanoformulations (ORMNFs) by employing the solvent evaporation technique
with two pluronic polymers to improve its therapeutic potential in
pancreatic cancer cells. Owing to the miscible nature of this drug
and polymer chain structure of the polymer and pluronic, ormeloxifene
can be entrapped into polymer cores and delivered in a sustained manner
for both in vitro and in vivo applications. These formulations were
optimized for therapeutic applications based on particle size and
morphology of particles and further characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR), and circular dichroism (CD). It was apparent
that formation of nanoparticles is visible within a few minutes to
60 min depending on the pluronic polymer employed. Ormeloxifene molecules
selectively resided inside the core of polymer/pluronic micelles.
We designed these formulations based on pluronic’s biocompatible
nature. Our results suggest enhanced anticancer potential of pluronic-ormeloxifene
nano-formulations in MiaPaCa and HPAF-II pancreatic cancer cell lines
as demonstrated by decreased cellular proliferation and mito-chondrial
membrane potential. This study will facilitate the preclinical development
of ORMNFs as a novel modality for pancreatic cancer management.

Results
Generation of ORMNFs and ORM’s Compatibility with Polymers
Pluronic ORM nanoformulations were prepared using the solvent evaporation
method.30 We screened eight different pluronic
polymers for ORMNF preparation and performed a TEM experiment for
screening. Results from TEM images showed that only two pluronic polymers
had shown uniform particle formation, and both F127-ORM and F68-ORM
nanoformulations were spherical in shape with ∼50 nm particle
size (Figure 1). All
formulations were compared to free ORM.

Figure 1 TEM images show particle
size of a single particle in ORMNFs. Eight
pluronic polymers were screened for ORMNF preparation and visualized
through TEM. Only F127 and F68 showed spherical and uniform construction
of nanoparticle (white arrows) formation with ORM. All other pluronic
polymers’ nanoparticles were aggregated/precipitated as clumps,
which can be seen in TEM images. Images were taken at 600 000×.
All prepared formulations were compared with free ORM.

From this experiment, we selected F127-ORM and
F68-ORM for further
characterizations. To generate a successful and stable nanoformulation,
it is necessary to validate the compatibility between the drug and
polymer molecules. An optical microscopic experiment was performed
to test ORM’s compatibility with F127 and F68 polymers. Images
from different timepoints in this experiment confirmed that ORM was
highly dispersed with these two polymers (Figure 2A). It was evident in this figure that free
ORM formed aggregated clusters as time increased, whereas ORM with
F127 and F68 was completely stable or compatible and fully miscible
as no clumps or aggregates of the drug were seen in these images.
Based on this, we propose a possible structure of nanoparticle formation
with pluronic polymer and ORM (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 (A) Optical microscopic images showing the compatibility
of ORM
with F127 and F68 polymers in ORMNFs. Dried drops of free ORM and
ORMNF aqueous solution were microscopically examined. Free ORM shows
excessive clumps of aggregation as time increases, whereas ORMNFs
show uniform particle formation with no drug aggregation. Images were
taken at 200×. (B) Schematic diagram showing the preparation
steps of ORMNFs (F127-ORM and F68-ORM) by a solvent evaporation method.

Physicochemical Characterization of ORMNFs
Particle
size, surface charge, FT-IR, and CD spectra analyses were performed
after each preparation to confirm the ORMNF production and the presence
of ORM in nanoparticles. Results from DLS analyses revealed that ORMNF
particle size and ζ-potential in 1× PBS aqueous condition
(swollen nanoparticles) were around ∼120 ± 1.7 nm and
∼−10 ± 0.5 mV, respectively [(Figure 3A) size F127-ORM: 119 ±
1.6 nm, F68-ORM: 123 ± 1.8 nm and (Figure 3B) surface charge F127-ORM: −7 ±
0.3 mV, F68-ORM: −9 ± 0.7 mV]. The presence of ORM in
ORMNFs showed characteristic peaks in the FT-IR spectral analysis
(Figure 3C,D).

and F68-ORM nanoformulations. FT-IR spectra of (C) F127-ORM and (D)
F68-ORM showing successful encapsulation of ORM in F127 and F68 polymer
cores.

This suggests that ORM was well dispersed within
F127 and F68 pluronic
polymer matrices due to miscibility/compatibility. Such property offers
superior encapsulation of ORM into the core of these two polymers.
The analysis of conformational changes at the secondary structure
of ORMNFs after their contact with bovine serum albumin (BSA) through
CD spectra revealed that there were not any significant changes in
the secondary structure of BSA–ORMNFs (Figure 4A–C). This set of data signifies less
interaction with serum proteins and, thus, suggests longer half-life
and superior adaptability of ORMNFs.

secondary structure changes of ORMNFs after BSA interaction. ORM and
its nanoformulations show stability and compatibility with bovine
serum albumin protein as no major conformational shifts/changes were
observed in CD spectra.

ORMNFs Inhibit Cellular Viability of Pancreatic Cancer Cells
Cancer cells proliferate in an uncontrolled manner,31 thus to qualify as an anticancer agent, a drug
candidate should be able to inhibit cancer cell proliferation/growth.
To examine the antiproliferative properties of ORMNFs, we exposed
MiaPaCa and HPAF-II pancreatic cancer cell lines to drug treatments
at different concentrations for 48 h for morphological changes and
MTS assay. The results from phase-contrast images showed marked deteriorations
in cellular morphology and viability of both MiaPaCa (Figure 5A) and HPAF-II (Figure 5B) cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner. MTS data was in correlation with these findings as both cell
lines (Figure 5C for
MiaPaCa and Figure 5D for HPAF-II) exhibited significantly decreased cellular proliferation
when compared to free ORM and vehicle controls.

Figure 5 ORMNFs altered morphology
of pancreatic cancer cell lines. (A)
MiaPaCa and (B) HPAF-II cell lines were treated with ORMNFs and free
ORM for 48 h and were imaged with a phase-contrast microscope at 200×
after a careful visualization. Images clearly showed a decreased number
of cells and apoptosis-like signs such as membrane blebbing and shrinkage.
ORMNFs inhibited cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines.
(C) MiaPaCa and (D) HPAF-II cell lines were treated with free ORM
and ORMNFs at different concentrations for 48 h. Utilizing the MTS
method, optical density was recorded at 490 nm to measure cellular
proliferation. Results were normalized to free ORM and vehicle controls
ETOH, F127, and F68. Error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM), n = 3. *p < 0.05.

ORMNFs Reduce Colony-Forming Ability of PanCa Cells
One of the major issues associated with cancer is that even a single
cell is capable of growing into large colonies.32 Thus, this is extremely of high importance to examine ORMNFs’
potential to reduce the colony-forming ability of pancreatic cancer
cells. Results from this experiment indicated that ORMNFs significantly
inhibited the clonogenicity of MiaPaCa pancreatic cancer cell lines
when compared to free ORM and vehicle controls (Figure 6A,B). However, F127-ORM seemed to have a
greater inhibitory effect than F68-ORM in a dose-dependent manner.

reduced colony-forming ability of pancreatic cancer cells.
(A) Images showing reduced clonogenicity of MiaPaCa cell lines. Cells
were treated for 14 days with lower concentrations of ORM and ORMNF
treatment. At the termination, cells were washed, fixed, stained,
and imaged. (B) Graph bars show quantitation of these images. Colonies
(∼50 cells) were manually counted. Results were compared to
free ORM and vehicle controls ETOH, F127, and F68. Error bars show
SEM, n = 3. *p < 0.05.

ORMNFs Decrease Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
Depolarization
of the mitochondrial membrane is an important and one of the early
events in the initiation of apoptosis.33 Therefore, to investigate the ability of ORMNFs to initiate apoptosis,
we performed a flow cytometry experiment. The tetramethylrhodamine
(TMRE) staining method was used to detect the depolarization of the
mitochondrial membrane. Our data from flow cytometry revealed that
ORMNFs significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential
at the highest concentration of 30 μM when compared to free
ORM in both MiaPaCa (Figure 7A) and HPAF-II (Figure 7B) cell lines.

Figure 7 ORMNFs decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. (A)
MiaPaCa
and (B) HPAF-II cell lines were exposed to free ORM and ORMNFs at
10, 20, and 30 μM concentrations for 24 h, stained with TMRE,
and analyzed by a flow cytometer to measure depolarization in the
mitochondrial membrane of cells. Results were normalized to free ORM
and control cells with no treatment. Error bars show SEM, n = 3. *p < 0.05.

ORMNFs Regulate Expression of Key Apoptotic Molecules
It was imperative to further confirm the apoptotic events at the
molecular levels. To do this, we examined the expression level of
two key players in apoptosis, namely, poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase
(PARP) and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xl)34 by utilizing immunoblotting. During apoptosis, total PARP
undergoes degradation, and, thus, it increases the amount of cleaved
PARP. Bcl-xl is an antiapoptotic marker, which promotes cell growth/survival.35,36Figure 8A clearly
illustrates that when MiaPaCa cells were treated with ORMNFs mainly
with a higher concentration of 30 μM, apoptosis was induced
as increased expression of cleaved PARP and decreased expression of
Bcl-xl were observed when compared to free ORM and the control group.

apoptosis in MiaPaCa pancreatic cancer cell lines.
(A) Immunoblots for apoptosis-related protein expression. MiaPaCa
cells were treated with free ORM and ORMNFs for 24 h and processed
for immunoblotting to detect the expression levels of PARP and Bcl-xl
proteins. β-actin was used as a loading control. Treatment groups
were compared to control cells with no treatment. (B) TEM images for
ultrastructural morphological changes. MiaPaCa cells were treated
with 30 μM free ORM and ORMNFs for 6 and 48 h and processed
for TEM imaging to visualize the morphological changes ultrastructurally
and to confirm apoptotic cell death. The control group represents
cells with no drug treatment. Treated cells were compared to control
cells. Images were taken at 3000×.

ORMNFs Induce Ultrastructural Morphological Alterations
TEM imaging technique was utilized to evident the morphological changes
and signs of apoptosis ultrastructurally in MiaPaCa cell lines. After
48 h of ORMNF (F127-ORM and F68-ORM) and free ORM exposure at 30 μM
concentration, clear signs of apoptosis were evident. TEM micrographs
revealed that after 6 h of drug treatment, cells did not show any
obvious morphological changes as the nucleus and cell membrane were
intact, whereas at later hours (48 h), cells were presented with ultrastructural
changes as distorted nucleus and apoptotic vacuoles (endosomal and
lysosomal) were observed (Figure 8B). These vacuoles are formed when the mitochondrial
membrane depolarizes, and cells undergo apoptosis.33 Depolarization in the membrane of the mitochondria disintegrates
the membrane wall, and, thus, it enhances the permeability and swelling
of the organelle.33 ORMNF-treated cells
showed more prominent apoptotic structures than free ORM and control
cells. This set of data clearly indicated that ORMNFs were successfully
delivered to pancreatic cancer cells, which further increased the
therapeutic potential of ORMNFs in these cells.

Discussion
Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease
with a poor 5 year survival
rate of only ∼8%.1 The treatment
for pancreatic cancer requires cytoreductive surgery with possible
chemotherapy.37 Although chemotherapy is
initially responsive, these tumors, unfortunately, relapse due to
the drug resistance.10 Thus, identifying
new therapeutic molecules are urgently required to treat this deadly
cancer. Enormous literature supports that nanocarrier(s) showed promising
potential for the delivery of anticancer drugs.28,38,39 Additionally, nanoparticle-based anticancer
drug formulations provide significant advantages over conventional
small-molecule drug(s) by minimizing nonspecific toxicity and enhancing
therapeutic efficacy at tumors, and this is feasible due to their
large surface-to-volume ratio.40−42

Ormeloxifene is a proven
clinical oral contraceptive agent for
humans and approved in India.24 In the
recent past, considerable work has been focused to examine the mechanistic
role of ormeloxifene in cancer, but not many strategies exist for
efficient delivery of ormeloxifene to cancer cells. Earlier studies
by Gupta and Jabrail43,44 have shown that physically cross-linked
microspheres of chitosan with different molecular weights and degree
of deacetylation offer sustained release of ormeloxifene. Our recent
investigations are the first examples of nanoparticle formulation
of ormeloxifene (poly[lactic-co-glycolic acid]-based
nanoparticles), which demonstrated excellent tumor growth reduction.22,23 Previous efforts from our group have demonstrated that improved
therapeutic effects of curcumin (an anticancer drug) were achieved
using β-cyclodextrin and poly(β-cyclodextrin) inclusion
complex, polymer nanoparticles, nanogels, and magnetic nanoparticle
drug delivery vehicles.45−48 Polymeric micelles have also shown significance as
a drug carrier for superior therapeutic potential.49−51 In the process
of preparing these polymeric micelles, spontaneous formation of drug
nanoparticle aggregation occurs by simply mixing the drug molecules
and polymer micelles together, this results in a core–shell
structure of the drug nanoparticle aggregates, and it is the main
advantage over other nanocarriers.52,53 A cremophor
EL free, paclitaxel-encapsulated poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly-(d,l-lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) polymer micelle
formulation under a trade name Genexol-PM has been approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating breast cancer.54,55 Another polymeric micelle based on Pluronic L61/F127-mixed micelles
(SP1049C from Supratech Pharma Inc.) has successfully completed Phase
II clinical trial for doxorubicin delivery to esophageal and gastroesophageal
cancers.56 Selection of the type of block
copolymers or pluronic polymers is a critical task, and it depends
on the type of the drug that needs to be formulated. Pluronic polymers,
mostly composed of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide)
(PPO), have widely been studied to load various anticancer agents.53,57 These polymers have also been demonstrated to act as inhibitors
of P-gp, which can sensitize tumor cells for therapeutic agents.58 In this context, developing a systemic formulation
of ormeloxifene would be highly valuable to overcome conventional
systemic barriers and to facilitate intracellular drug accumulation
at the tumor site.

In this current investigation, ormeloxifene-encapsulated
polymer
micelle nanoformulations (ORMNFs) were successfully designed, developed,
and tested for superior anticancer activity in MiaPaCa and HPAF-II
pancreatic cancer cell lines. We employed various analytical tools
to characterize ORMNFs and examined their anticancer activity using
the MTS technique for cell proliferation, flow cytometry for mitochondrial
membrane depolarization, and immunoblotting for protein expression.
DLS data of ORM-encapsulated nanoformulations exhibited a particle
size of ∼120 nm and surface charge of ∼−10 mV.
Transmission electron microscopy images of ORMNFs indicated a smooth
surface morphology for F68-ORM, whereas F127-ORM demonstrated an aggregative
pattern of drug molecules and particle size of ∼50 nm for both
nanoformulations. CD spectra and optical images showed that ORMNFs
are highly compatible and stable with serum albumin and within the formulation itself.
The cytotoxic effects of free ORM and ORM nanoformulations exhibited
a dose-dependent effect in decreased cell proliferation for both pancreatic
cancer cell lines and in reduced colony-formation ability for MiaPaCa
pancreatic cancer cell lines. At all treatment concentrations, ORM
nanoformulations showed higher toxicity than free ORM. This enhanced
cytotoxicity can be attributed to greater uptake of nanoformulations
by the cells, which is a widely explained phenomenon. Additionally,
ORMNFs induced apoptosis in these pancreatic cancer cell lines as
evident by a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and the altered
expression levels of PARP and Bcl-xl, two important apoptotic markers.
Moreover, ORMNFs caused obvious ultrastructural changes in these cells
as vacuole formations were observed with TEM, which further confirmed
the induction of apoptosis.

Remarkably, an enhanced anticancer
potential of ORMNFs indicates
the feasibility for developing these novel nanoparticle drug formulations
as a lead therapeutic modality for pancreatic cancer, provided that,
additional studies are warranted for its preclinical and clinical
investigations. Additionally, since ormeloxifene has already been
in human use for oral delivery, this novel formulation can be delivered
orally as well as intravenously.

Material and Methods
Chemicals and Cell Culture
All chemicals and reagents
used in this work were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St.
Louis, MO) unless otherwise mentioned. MiaPaCa and HPAF-II pancreatic
cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture
Collection) (Manassas, VA). These pancreatic cancer cell lines were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
and DMEM-F12 (Gibco, Gibco Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), respectively,
with supplements: 4500 mg/L glucose, 4.00 mM l-glutamine,
10% heat-inactivated FBS (Atlantic Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA),
and 5 mL of 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2. All of the cell lines used in this study were
authenticated and checked for mycoplasma and other infections.

Generation of ORM Nanoformulations (ORMNFs)
Eight different
pluronic polymers, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene
glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol), MW 1100 (L31),
1900 (L35), 2000 (L61), 2900 (L64), 4400 (L121), 5800 (P123), 8400
(F68), and 12 400 (F127), were screened to prepare ORM nanoformulations
following a solvent evaporation technique30 with some modifications. Briefly, 10 mg of ORM in 1 mL of ethanol
(ETOH) and 20 mg of the polymer in 1 mL of water were dissolved separately.
Next, 100 μL of ORM solution was added dropwise to 900 μL
of the polymeric solution, and it is then mixed with 1 mL of water
under magnetic stirring at 800 rpm for about a minute in a 2 mL glass
vial. Ethanol was evaporated under stirring overnight at room temperature
to obtain a homogenous ORM nanoparticle formulation. This homogeneous
suspension was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (Millex-LG,
Millipore Co.) and lyophilized for further long-term use. This technique
allows ormeloxifene to disperse in polymer matrices or self-assembled
into pluronic micelles.

Compatibility of ORMNFs
Before testing these newly
formed formulations in vitro and in vivo, it was imperative to evaluate
the stability/compatibility between drug and polymer molecules. To
determine the stability/compatibility of ORMNFs, we prepared 500 μg/mL
aqueous solutions of ORMNFs, free ORM, and performed a visual evaluation
of nanoparticle formation using the optical microscopy analysis. For
this experiment, 2–3 drops of these freshly prepared solutions
were placed onto a glass slide and were air-dried in a fume hood overnight.
Slides were protected from exposing to dust and light, and the next
morning, slides were imaged using optical microscopy (Olympus BX 41
microscope; Olympus, Center Valley, PA) at 200×.

Physicochemical Characterization
ORMNFs were characterized
by various techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR), and circular dichroism (CD).

Transmission Electron Microscopy
The particle size
and morphology of ORMNFs were examined using a JEOL-1210 transmission
electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For this study, a drop
of ORMNFs (1 mg/mL suspension in water) was dispensed on a thin film
of amorphous carbon deposited on a 200 mesh formvar-coated copper
TEM grid (grid size: 97 μm) (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA),
followed by (2% w/v of uranyl acetate) staining solution, and air-dried.
These nanoparticles on the TEM grid were viewed and imaged under TEM
operating at 60 kV.

Dynamic Light Scattering
The particle size distribution
and surface charge (zeta potential, ζ) of prepared ORMNFs were
measured by the laser diffraction method using a Delsa Nano C particle
size analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). After 2 min equilibration
of the instrument, all of the measurements were performed at 25 °C.
For measurements, ORMNFs (1 mg/mL suspension) were ultrasonicated
for 30 s and transferred into a four-sided, clear plastic cuvette
or a capillary ζ-potential cell for size distribution and ζ-potential.
All results were the mean of 3 test runs.

Fourier Transform Infrared
To confirm ormeloxifene’s
successful assembly in the pluronic polymer matrix, the FT-IR spectrometry
experiments were performed. Using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum BX spectrophotometer
(Perkin-Elmer Inc., Norwalk, CT), FT-IR spectra were obtained for
ORM and ORMNFs. For each FT-IR sample acquisition, 32 scans at the
speed of 2 cm–1 were recorded, and an average of
these scans was presented as the FT-IR spectrum. The spectral range
was chosen from 4000 to 650 cm–1.

Circular Dichroism
A Jasco 815 circular dichroism (CD)
spectrometer (JASCO International Inc., Ltd., Japan) was utilized
to measure the changes in the secondary structure of the protein (bovine
serum albumin, BSA) upon their interaction with ORMNFs. For this experiment,
we used various concentrations of free ORM and ORMNFs (10–40
μM) with 10 μM of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The CD spectra
of BSA or BSA-ORM or BSA–ORMNFs were recorded from 200 to 260
nm in a 1 cm quartz cell at 25 °C.

Cell Viability Assay
To perform cell proliferation/viability
assay, 2 pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa and HPAF-II were seeded
at 5 × 103 cells/well density in 96-well plates and
allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were treated with
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 μM concentrations of either free
ORM or ORM nanoformulations (ORMNFs) for 48 h. ETOH and blank pluronics
were used as vehicle controls for ORM and ORM nanoformulations, respectively.
After 48 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and microscopically visualized for imaging. Images were captured
with an Olympus microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Further,
25 μL of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96 AQueous, Promega Corporation,
Madison, MI) was added to each well, and plates were incubated for
the next 2–3 h. Post-incubation, absorbance was recorded at
490 nm spectrophotometrically using a BioMate 3 microplate reader
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Each experiment was done
in replicates of 6 and repeated 3 individual times.

Colony-Formation Assay
We utilized MiaPaCa cell lines
for further long-term treatment evaluation of ORMNFs. At the density
of 500 cells/well in 6-well plates, cells were plated and allowed
to attach. When cells were fully attached usually in 24–30
h, different concentrations of ORMNFs were given to the cells and
allowed to further incubate for 14–15 days. On the day of termination,
plates were washed with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol (MEOH),
stained with hematoxylin, and again washed with running water. Plates
were then air-dried and imaged with a gel doc (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
Colonies were manually counted, and each experiment was performed
three individual times.

Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨM) using TMRE
2 × 105 MiaPaCa and HPAF-II cells were plated per
well in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day,
cells were treated with ORM and ORMNFs at 10, 20, and 30 μM
concentrations for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized,
and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the final pellet.
The pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL PBS with 50 nM tetramethylrhodamine(TMRE,
ethyl ester) stain containing in it, and cells were further incubated
for 25–30 min in the dark at 37 °C. After the indicated
time, cells were analyzed under the FL2 channel using a BD Accuri
C6 flow cytometer. The experiment was performed three independent
times.

Immunoblotting
For immunoblotting, 5 × 106 MiaPaCa cells were plated in a 100 mm dish and allowed to
adhere overnight. The next morning, cells were treated with ORM and
ORMNFs at 20 and 30 μM concentrations for the next 48 h. Next,
cells were washed with PBS, and lysates were collected by scraping
cells with SDS buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and
sonicated for 30–40 s during freeze–thaw cycles. The
SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) method was employed further
to quantify the protein concentration. 50 μg of protein from
each sample was loaded and separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel
electrophoresis at 150 V for 60 min. Proteins were then transferred
onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membrane at 100 V for 90
min. The membranes/blots were next blocked with 5% skimmed milk in
tris buffered Saline with Twin 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1
h and further incubated with primary antibodies specific for poly[ADP-ribose]
polymerase (PARP), B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xl), and β-actin
at 4 °C for overnight. The next day, blots were washed thrice
with TBST and incubated with goat antirabbit/mouse secondary antibodies
for 1 h at room temperature. For protein signal detection, blots were
washed again thrice with TBST for 15 min per wash and soaked in with
a Lumi Light reagent (Roche, Nutley, NJ) and imaged with a gel doc
(BioRad, Hercules, CA).

Ultrastructure Morphological Analysis with TEM
TEM
has become a powerful tool to study the morphological changes at the
ultrastructural level and detect apoptosis in cells.59 To understand the ORMNF-induced apoptosis ultrastructurally,
1 × 106 MiaPaCa cells per 100 mm dish were plated
and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were exposed
to 30 μM of ORMNFs or equivalent free ORM for 6 and 48 h. At
the indicated timepoints, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized,
centrifuged, and fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde (v/v) in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer and followed by 1% OsO4 solution fixation. Further,
cells were washed with cacodylate buffer, and a graded series of acetone
from 35 to 100% (35, 50, 75, 95, and 100%) was used to dehydrate the
cell pellets. Next, cell pellets were embedded with low viscosity
Spurr resin. Ultrathin sections of 70–90 nm thickness were
cut/sectioned from these resin blocks utilizing an ultramicrotome.
Cut sections were then transferred into 97 μm sized TEM grids
(Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) and stained with uranyl acetate and
lead acetate. After staining, these sections were visualized with
transmission electron microscopy for ultrastructural changes.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical calculations were
performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
The data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
Unpaired Student’s t-test was used for comparison
of two groups. Differences were considered statistically significant
when the p-value was <0.05.

Conclusions
To conclude, this work provides a proof-of-concept
foundation that
pluronic polymers can be a successful delivery vehicle for ormeloxifene.
ORMNFs had a mean particle size of ∼120 nm and ζ-potential
of ∼−10 mV. These values are comparable with existing
FDA-approved nanoformulations for cancer therapeutics.60 Furthermore, these formulations exhibited superior
anticancer activities against pancreatic cancer cell lines than free
ormeloxifene. ORM nanoformulations induced apoptosis through decreasing
the mitochondrial membrane potential and altering the expression of
apoptosis-related two key proteins and the ultrastructure of these
cells. Based on these results, we believe that ORM nanoformulations
could be a promising treatment regimen for pancreatic cancer. These
results are warranted to further examine the anticancer efficacy of
ORM nanoformulations in clinically relevant mouse models.
