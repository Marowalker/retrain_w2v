Recent
developments in the field of designing novel nanostructures
with various functionalities have pushed the scientific world to design
and develop high-quality nanomaterials with multifunctional applications.
Here, we propose a new kind of doped metal oxide pyrochlore nanostructure
for solid-state phosphor, X-ray scintillator, and optical thermometry.
The developed samarium-activated La2Hf2O7 (LHOS) nanoparticles (NPs) emit a narrow and stable red emission
with lower color temperature and adequate critical distance under
near-UV and X-ray excitations. When the LHOS NPs are exposed to an
energetic X-ray beam, the Sm3+ ions situated at the symmetric
environment get excited along with those located at the asymmetric
environment, which results in a low asymmetry ratio of Sm3+ under radioluminescence compared to photoluminescence. High activation
energy and adequate thermal sensitivity of the LHOS NPs highlight
their potential as a thermal sensor. Our results indicate that these
Sm3+-activated La2Hf2O7 NPs can serve as a multifunctional UV, X-ray, and thermographic
phosphor.

1 Introduction
In
the current era of materials science, new kinds of functional
materials have been continuously developed to reduce the burden from
increasing human demand in the areas of energy, health, environment,
food security, agriculture, and so forth.1−5 Some materials which can perform multiple functions
in a system because of their unique properties are known as multifunctional
materials. Such materials can reduce human workload and improve our
lifestyle by virtue of their efficiency, reliability, cost-efficiency,
and scalability. In the areas of photonics and optoelectronics, a
phosphor material which can function for solid-state lighting, scintillation,
and luminescence thermometer is desirable for meeting a multitude
of demands. Phosphor materials synthesized in a nanodomain offer a
high electron–hole overlap integral, large light collection,
and ease of coating on films/fibers.6,7 The host-to-dopant
energy-transfer process in nanosized phosphors is highly relevant
because of their potential to exhibit higher-resolution displays at
lower thermal budget relative to their bulk counterparts.8 Lanthanide ion-doped nanoparticles (NPs) have
displayed outstanding photophysical properties such as large Stoke
shift, high color purity, higher excited-state lifetime, and substantial
quantum efficiency.7,9 Such unique properties provide
obvious advantages for luminescent materials designed toward UV-excited
phosphors, X-ray scintillators, and thermographic phosphors (TGPs).
Designing efficient nanosized phosphors which display all these application
potentials would help solve a variety of issues in the areas of optical
technology. This study is intended to meet these challenges and fill
the gap.

UV-based and blue light phosphors are used for solid-state
lighting,
light-emitting diodes, display panels, sensors, biomedical imaging
and diagnostics, catalysts, and so forth.10,11 Their application in white light-emitting diodes is in high demand
because of their desirable power output, longevity, environment benignness,
and low cost.12 However, the present commercial
white light lamps through a combination of a yellow phosphor (YAG:Ce3+) and a blue light-emitting diode chip (InGaN) suffer from
low color rendering index and high correlated color temperature (CCT)
problems because of the lack of suitable red components.13,14 Therefore, continuous search for better red phosphors with low CCT,
high color purity, and high structural and thermal stability is undergoing.

Scintillators are in high demand because of their broad applications
for ionizing radiation detectors, X-ray imaging, biological and medical
diagnostics, photodynamic therapy, and so forth.15,16 Their single crystal or bulk form suffers from difficult optical
property tuning, long processing time, sophisticated instrumentation,
and high fabrication cost.15 NPs and nanoceramics
are expected to meet these challenges because of the dominance of
surface atoms with strains and electron–hole overlap integral
to fine-tune their optical properties.

Moreover, phosphors have
been explored for thermal sensing as TGPs
because of their temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) characteristics
such as emission intensity and excited-state lifetime. As luminescence
thermometers, TGPs have obvious advantages over other conventional
thermal sensing methods as they do not require direct contact, are
operational in harsh conditions where large electromagnetic noises
exist, and work well in aqueous systems. They also have fast response
and high sensitivity and accuracy. Lanthanide-doped materials, such
as silicates, garnets, and niobates, have gained significant momentum
for such application because of their high spatial resolution and
accuracy of temperature gradients.17 Most
of the relevant work has been performed in the visible region of electromagnetic
spectrum to determine the temperature of running jet turbines, gas
centrifuges, and chemical reaction vessels.18 However, current TGPs are restricted to bulk samples with moderate
sensitivity and intermediate temperature range.

La2Hf2O7 (LHO) is a desirable
host for efficient lanthanide-doped phosphor materials because of
its high structural stability, wide band gap, the ability to accommodate
dopant ions at both La3+ and Hf4+ sites, and
high radiation stability, refractive index, and dielectric constant.19 Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlore
has a phonon frequency <712 cm–1, which is expected
to decrease for heavier hafnate-based pyrochlores.20 As a result, LHO could have low nonradiative relaxations
and accordingly enhanced luminescence intensity. It also has high
stopping power for X- and γ-rays because of its high density
of 7.9 g/cm3 and the presence of hafnium with atomic number
72. Sm3+-doped phosphors exhibit sharp emission bands and
long excited-state lifetimes, and the large difference between the
lowest luminescent level and the highest nonluminescent level of Sm3+ ions makes it an excellent structural probe.21 To the best of our knowledge, there is no report
on designing multifunctional nanosized phosphors using Sm3+-doped LHO (LHOS) NPs as UV, X-ray, and TGPs.

In this paper,
we report the exploration of our LHOS NPs synthesized
by a molten salt synthesis (MSS) method as a new type of multifunctional
UV-excited phosphor, X-ray scintillator, and TGP. Under near-UV excitation,
these NPs demonstrate red emission and 2.5% quenching concentration.
Magnetic dipole transition (MDT) at ∼568 nm is absent, which
suggests a highly asymmetric environment of Sm3+ ions in
the LHO lattice and endows high red color purity. Under X-ray irradiation,
these NPs show orange-red emission with the presence of intense MDT
peak. The LHOS NPs also display favorable thermal stability and good
photo-/radioluminescence efficiencies. The high activation energy
and desirable thermal sensitivity for luminescence thermometer are
attributed to the low phonon energy, low defect density, high crystal
quality, and high structural stability of the LHO host. Overall, our
LHOS NPs demonstrate multifunctional application potentials as UV,
X-ray, and TGPs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Phase, Crystallite Size, and Morphology of
the LHOS NPs
The synthesized LHOS NPs are in the ideal pyrochlore
phase with Fd3̅m space group
(Figure S2) and are nanospheres with particle
size between 20 and 70 nm (Figure S3) as
investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), respectively.

2.2 Structural Analysis: Raman
and FTIR Spectroscopy
On the basis of the concepts of group
theory, the Raman spectra
of ideal pyrochlore A2B2O7 compounds
(Fd3̅m space group) consist
of six well-defined and sharp vibrational peaks in the range 200–1000
cm–1, which are ascribed to A1g + Eg + 4F2g.22,23 Radius ratio (rA/rB) plays an important
role to decide the exact structure of A2B2O7 compounds. When rA/rB > 1.46, an ordered pyrochlore is the most prevalent
structure.24 LHO prefers to stabilize in
an ideal pyrochlore structure because rLa (CN = 8) = 1.16 Å and rHf (CN =
6) = 0.710 Å, giving rLa3+/rHf4+ = 1.63. Figure 1a shows the Raman spectra of
the LHOS NPs that exhibit peaks located approximately at 306, 320,
397, 498, 519, and 615 cm–1 (see deconvoluted spectra
in Figure 1b), which
correspond to F2g, Eg, F2g, A1g, F2g, and F2g modes.25 Specifically, the peaks at 306, 320, and 397 cm–1 are originated from the vibrations of the metal–oxygen bonds
(i.e., La–O and Hf–O bonds). The 519 and 615 cm–1 peaks arise from the Hf–O stretching. The
498 cm–1 peak arising from the A1g mode
is attributed to the bending of O–Hf–O bond in HfO6 octahedra.26 The small peak at
around 769 cm–1 is ascribed to the distortion of
the HfO6 octahedra.27 Therefore,
based on our Raman data, the LHOS NPs have the ideal pyrochlore structure.
Moreover, changing of Sm3+ doping concentration (≤10%)
does not distort the basic pyrochlore matrix of the LHO host, as can
be seen from the Raman spectra.

Figure 1 (a) Raman spectra and (b) vibrational
peak characteristics of ideal
pyrochlore structure obtained after Gaussian fitting, (c) FTIR spectra,
and (d) expanded FTIR spectra at low wavenumbers of the LHOS NPs.

In the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
of the LHOS NPs
(Figure 1c), the broad-band
peaks located at around 3400 cm–1 are attributed
to stretching of surface-adsorbed water molecules on the LHOS NPs.28 The peaks at around 1330–1500 cm–1 are due to bending vibration of OH bond.29 The IR bands at around 840–920 cm–1 are attributed to wagging vibration of NH band, which
may come from the used NH4OH during the coprecipitation
process. The IR peaks at around 510 cm–1 are the
absorption bands characteristic to pyrochlore A2Hf2O7 compounds, which is consistent with the Raman
data shown above.30 The expanded FTIR spectra
in the low wavelength range clearly depict the characteristic absorption
of rare earth hafnates (Figure 1d). The absorption bands characteristic of A2B2O7 hafnates pyrochlore structure was reported by
Klee and Weitz.31 In fact, Sevastyanov
and group30 have observed absorption from
Nd2Hf2O7 and Gd2Hf2O7 pyrochlore at around 530–540 cm–1.

2.3 PL Spectroscopy
The PL excitation
spectra of the LHOS NPs recorded at 607 nm corresponding to the 4G5/2 → 6H5/2 emission
of Sm3+ (Figure 2a) can be divided into two regions. The first region with
a very weak band at around 275–300 nm is attributed to the
charge transfer from O2– → Sm3+ ion. The second region from 300 to 500 nm of the excitation spectra
includes fine peaks at 322, 345, 362, 377, 405, 420, 446, 461, 467,
472, 480, and 490 nm, which correspond to the transitions of Sm3+ ions: 6H5/2 → 2L15/2, 6H5/2 → 4H9/2, 6H5/2 → 4D3/2, 6H5/2 → 4D1/2, 6H5/2 → 4F7/2, 6H5/2 → 4P5/2, 6H5/2 → 4G9/2, 6H5/2 → 4I9/2, 6H5/2 → 4I11/2, 6H5/2 → 4I13/2, and 6H5/2 → 4I15/2, respectively.32 More
interestingly, the Laporte forbidden f–f excitation bands of
the LHOS NPs are found to be more intense than the charge-transfer
band. This phenomenon indicates that the LHO host has low phonon energy
and the energy levels of the doped Sm3+ ions match well
with the band structure of LHO for broad phosphor applications. It
is supplemented by lower phonon energy of the LHO host (745 cm–1) together with relaxation of f–f transition
in the presence of a crystalline field offered by the LHO host.

mechanism of host-to-dopant energy transfer, (d) variation of integrated
emission intensity in the range of 575–675 nm as a function

decay profiles of the LHOS NPs with Sm3+ doping level from
0.5 to 10.0%. The inset of Figure 1a shows the magnified excitation spectra in the wavelength
range of 260–315 nm.

The three main PL emission peaks of the LHOS NPs under 405 nm excitation
are at 605, 653, and 717 nm (Figure 2b), corresponding to the 4G5/2 → 6H7/2, 4G5/2 → 6H9/2, and 4G5/2 → 6H11/2 transitions of Sm3+ ions.33 Intriguingly, the MDT 4G5/2 → 6H5/2 at ∼565
nm is absent, indicating that the majority of Sm3+ ions
are located at sites without inversion center. The A2B2O7-type ordered pyrochlore structure of the La2Hf2O7 host with LaO8 and
HfO6 coordinations is depicted in Figure S4a.34 Samarium ions are expected
to occupy both La and Hf sites, which is also shown pictorially in Figure S4b. On the basis of ionic size and charge,
a large fraction of samarium ions is localized at distorted LaO8 scalenohedra.

In our case, they are localized at highly asymmetric sites in the
LHO host. This phenomenon is consistent with (i) the large spectral
splitting of the 4G5/2 → 6H7/2, 4G5/2 → 6H9/2, and 4G5/2 → 6H11/2 transitions observed (Figure 2b) and (ii) the high luminescence intensity
of the 653 nm peak corresponding to the electric dipole transition
(EDT) 4G5/2 → 6H9/2. Moreover, the characteristic 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 transition of Sm3+ ions has mixed
electric and magnetic dipoles, which contribute to the orange-red
emission at 605 nm as the strongest peak.35 Because there is no MDT emission and strong EDT at 653 nm, the asymmetry
ratio value of the LHOS NPs is much higher than that of Eu3+-doped La2Hf2O7 NPs (∼3.0).19,36 It is reported that surface defects and cation vacancies are deleterious
to PL efficiency where oxygen vacancies may induce improved emissions
by virtue of energy transfer.37 Previously,
we observed violet-blue emission from undoped LHO NPs under UV irradiation,
which was attributed to the presence of ionized oxygen vacancies in
the band gap of the undoped LHO NPs based on density functional theory
calculations.38 In one of our earlier work,
we have estimated the band gap of LHO to be 5.63 eV using hybrid exchange–correlation
functional (HSE06)38 and is in close agreement
with the experimental value of 5.6 ± 0.1 eV. LHO with a large
band gap value of 5.6 eV can provide enough space to accommodate Sm3+ 4f energy levels and effectively reduce the probability
of the overlapping between the lowest 4f state of Sm3+ ions
and the conduction band maxima of the LHO host.39 The energy transfer is mediated through ionized oxygen
vacancies which are localized within the band gap of LHO and transfer
photon energy to excited states of samarium ions. The energy levels
of dopant Sm3+ ions are situated within the band gap of
the LHO host. On the basis of our earlier report38,40 and close similarity between Sm3+ and Eu3+, Sm d- and f-states are present in both valence and conduction bands
of LHO as both minority and majority spin components. This makes the
interaction between O 2p states and Sm d/f states highly feasible
to facilitate efficient host-to-dopant energy transfer. On the basis
of the Dexter proposal, an effective energy transfer needs a good
spectral overlap between the donor emission and the acceptor excitation.41 To further validate these results, we have shown
experimental results on the spectral overlap between the emission
of the LHO host (donor) and the excitation of Sm3+ ions
(acceptor) (Figure S5a), which suggests
an efficient energy transfer from the host to the dopant ions.

To study the role of oxygen vacancies on the PL spectra, both undoped
LHO NPs and the LHOS NPs were annealed under an oxygen-deficient atmosphere
and vacuum. Reducing atmosphere annealing was avoided to prevent reduction
of Hf4+ ions in the samples.33 The PL spectral results (Figure S5b)
demonstrated that the vacuum annealing enhanced the violet-blue emission
intensity for the undoped LHO compared to the initially prepared sample
in air.38 For the LHOS NPs, the red emission
intensity increased to 2.5 times after vacuum annealing because of
the increase of oxygen vacancy concentration. At the same time, the
disappearance of the oxygen vacancy-related band at 400 nm from the
LHO NPs to the LHOS NPs confirms the efficient energy transfer between
the oxygen vacancy of the LHO host and Sm3+ dopant ions
in the LHOS NPs.

2.4 Concentration Quenching
Study
Dopant
concentration plays important roles in the luminescence performance
of phosphors. The Sm3+ doping level in the LHOS NPs changes
their PL intensity but does not affect the spectral profile because
of the strong shielding of 4f electrons of Sm3+ ions by
the outer lying 5s2 and 5p6 electrons (Figure 2b).42 The initial increase of PL emission intensity is ascribed
to the increase of Sm3+ doping percentage; therefore, more
luminophores are available for excitation by near-UV light at 405
nm. After 2.5 mol % doping level, the distance between Sm3+ ions decreases to an extent that there is enhanced probability of
nonradiative energy transfer between adjacent Sm3+ ions
as concentration quenching. The quenching concentration of Sm3+ ions of these LHOS NPs is 2.5 mol % (Figure 2d), which is comparable with other reported
Sm3+-doped inorganic hosts in the literature (Table S2).

To understand the underlying
nonradiative energy-transfer mechanism, that is, exchange interaction,
radiation reabsorption, or multipole–multipole interaction,
of these LHOS NPs, we turn to the empirical relationship proposed
by Blasse to determine the critical distance (Rc) at which concentration quenching takes place based on eq S1.43

On
average, there is one activator ion per V/XcN. The calculated critical
distance Rc of the LHOS (2.5 mol %) NPs
is 30.9 Å, which is much larger than the typical critical distance
responsible for energy transfer via exchange interaction (5 Å).
Because radiation reabsorption is only effective when the emission
spectrum of the donor and the excitation spectrum of the acceptor
overlap broadly, which is not the case for the LHOS NPs, we can rule
out the radiation reabsorption mechanism here. Therefore, electric
multipole–multipole interaction would be the main mechanism
responsible for the energy transfer from one Sm3+ ion to
another in the LHOS NPs. It means that the Sm3+ ions localized
at two LaO8 scalenohedra at a distance less than 30.9 Å
would undergo nonradiative energy transfer and leads to luminescence
quenching by orbital overlap.

The calculated critical distance Rc of the LHOS NPs is larger compared to the
reported values of other
lanthanide-doped pyrochlores, such as Nd2Zr2O7:Eu3+ (13.64 Å), Y2Ti2O7:Eu3+ (6.47 Å), Gd2Zr2O7:Sm3+ (6.28 Å), La2Ti2O7:Er3+ (13.8 Å),
La2Zr2O7:Eu3+ (5.0 Å),
and CaYTiNbO7:Eu3+ (8.0 Å).44−49 This can be attributed to the low phonon energy and nanocrystalline
nature of the LHO host.

We have used the Van Uitert equation
to confirm the multipole–multipole
interaction as the exact nonradiative energy-transfer mechanisms for
our LHOS NPs.50 If nonradiative energy
transfer involves the same acceptor and donor ions (i.e., Sm3+ in the case here), the type of electric multipolar interaction can
be deciphered from the variation in emission intensity per unit concentration
using the relation S2.

When θ = 3, nonradiative energy
transfer proceeds via exchange
interaction, θ = 6 corresponds to dipole–dipole (d–d)
interaction, θ = 8 corresponds to dipole–quadrupole (d–p)
interaction, and θ = 10 corresponds to quadrupole–quadrupole
(q–q) interaction.51 Applying the
condition of β(x)θ/3 ≫ 1, eq S2 is simplified as eq S3.

The slope of this equation (−θ/3) obtained
by plotting
log(I/x) versus log(x) gives the electric multipolar characteristic value θ. For
our LHOS NPs, the slope is −2.19814 (Figure 2e), so θ is approximately 6, corresponding
to the dipole–dipole interaction, as similarly observed from
La2Ti2O7:Eu.52

2.5 Luminescence Lifetime Spectroscopy
Understanding
local site occupancy is important to interpret the
local symmetry around dopant ions in a host and optimize the luminescence
properties of phosphors. Population analysis and number of lifetime
components from lifetime spectra enable us to predict the local structure
of dopant ions in hosts. The luminescence decay profiles of the LHOS
NPs (Figure 2f) under
excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 and 607 nm, respectively,
can be fitted with a biexponential function using eq S4 with a time resolution of 1–2 μs.

In ordered pyrochlore LHO, La3+ ions exist in an eightfold
coordination in highly distorted scalenohedra, whereas Hf4+ ions exist in a sixfold coordination in ideal octahedra, as confirmed
by our XRD and Raman spectra data (Figures S2 and 1).29 Both
the lifetime values are attributed to Sm3+ ions localized
at La3+ sites in distorted scalenohedra geometry. It is
known that there is high concentration of defects in pyrochlore structure.
If LaO8 is surrounded by such defects, the LHOS NPs have
more nonradiative channels and therefore short decay lifetime. Otherwise,
defects are at long distance with long lifetime of the LHOS NPs.53,54 Specifically, the long-lived component τ2 is ascribed
to Sm3+ ions occupying LaO8 scalenohedra sites,
which are at long distance from point or structural defects. On the
other hand, the fast decaying component τ1 is due
to Sm3+ ions localized at LaO8 scalenohedra
but at proximity of defects. In addition, both the lifetime values
of the LHOS NPs decrease monotonically with increasing Sm3+ doping concentration (Table S3). This
can also be seen from the variations of the short- and long-lived
lifetimes with Sm3+ concentration (Figure S6). This may be attributed to enhanced probability
of nonradiative energy transfer among Sm3+ ions with increasing
doping concentration. In our LHOS NPs, Sm3+ ions occupy
La3+ sites, and the matching charge does not invoke the
need to compensate defects in the LHO lattice. This is an additional
advantage of our LHOS NPs because such defects as nonradiative pathways
are deleterious and adversely affect their performance.55

2.6 Colorimetric Performance
of the LHOS NPs
As expected, the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity
diagram (Figure 3a)
and the calculated CIE color coordinates (Table S4) demonstrate that the orange-red light emits from our LHOS
NPs under 405 nm excitation because no PL spectral shift is seen as
a function of Sm3+ doping concentration (Figure 2b). CCT is one of the important
parameters to evaluate phosphor performance. It is reported that CCT
values below 5000 K are ideal to generate artificial warm white light.56 The CCT values of our LHOS NPs are calculated
using McCamy and Kelly approximation mentioned in eq S5.57,58

Figure 3 (a) CIE index diagram (excited at 405
nm) and (b) variation of
the CCT with Sm3+ doping concentration of the LHOS NPs.
The inset of Figure 3a shows the magnified color coordinates of the LHOS NPs with different
Sm3+ concentrations.

The calculated CCT values of the LHOS NPs are in the range of 3057–3437
K (Table S4), and the variation of the
CCT values is shown in Figure 3b. In that context, our LHOS NPs as red phosphors with CCT
of 3266 K can be quite useful in designing a high-quality warm white
light, which can be further explored for indoor and office lighting.59 The CCT values reported for various europium-
and samarium-doped inorganic oxides such as GdPO4:Eu, LiEu(WO4)2, CsGd(MoO4)2:Eu, LaPO4:Sm, and GdPO4:Sm are 1704, 2175, 1627, 1984, and
1925 K, respectively.60−63 In comparison to other lanthanide-doped inorganic oxides in terms
of CCT, our LHOS-nanosized phosphors have an optimum value as a red
phosphor.

2.7 Radioluminescence Performance of the LHOS
NPs
Upon X-ray excitation, the LHOS NPs present four emission
bands at 568, 611, 656, and 722 nm corresponding to 4G5/2 → 6H5/2, 4G5/2 → 6H7/2, 4G5/2 → 6H9/2, and 4G5/2 → 6H11/2 transitions of Sm3+ ions (Figure 4a). These radioluminescence (RL) spectra are obviously different
from the corresponding PL spectra (Figure 2b). The RL asymmetry ratio was found to be
1.33 for the LHOS NPs (2.5%). The major difference is that the RL
spectra show intense MDT 4G5/2 → 6H5/2 peak at 568 nm, which is absent in the PL
spectra. This may be attributed to different mechanisms upon UV and
X-ray excitations.

Figure 4 (a) RL emission
spectra and (b) variation of RL emission intensity
as a function of Sm3+ ion concentration of the LHOS NPs.

It is reported that lanthanide dopants are distributed
at both
La and Hf sites in multiple site lattices such as La2Hf2O7.38 LHO has ideal
pyrochlore structure with distorted LaO8 scalenohedra and
perfect HfO6 octahedra.19 The
EDT peak normally results when Sm3+ ions sitting at asymmetric
La site is excited, whereas the MDT peak appears because of excitation
of Sm ion sitting at symmetric Hf site. The luminescence processes
under UV and X-ray irradiations are distinct because different mechanisms
are involved. On X-ray irradiation, e––h+ pairs are created because 4f–4f bands of Sm3+ ions and LHO are coexcited.64 Under UV
excitation, only the 4f–4f bands of Sm3+ ions are
excited, but not the LHO host. Hence, in the LHOS NPs, a larger fraction
of Sm3+ ions at the La site gets excited under UV excitation,
leading to intense EDT and absence of MDT emission. On the other hand,
both Sm3+ ions at La and Hf sites get excited under X-ray
excitation, leading to both EDT and MDT emission peaks.

The
nature of heavy constituents is very important for efficient
X-ray scintillation process because X-ray absorption intensity varies
proportionally to Zeff4/AE3, where Zeff and A are effective atomic number and atomic mass, respectively,
and E is the energy of X-ray.65 Accordingly, LHO is a desirable host for X-ray scintillators
because of its high effective atomic number of Hf (72) and density
(7.9 g/cc). In the first step, a scintillating material absorbs X-ray
through photoelectric effect (PE), which creates electrons and holes.
At the beginning, the X-ray (E < few 100 keV)
interacts with Hf atom of the pyrochlore LHOS NPs mostly through PE.
A similar interaction mechanism was predominant in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals where X-ray interacts with the Pb atom of the perovskite
nanocrystals through PE.66

As shown
by the variation of integrated RL intensity between 575
and 675 nm corresponding to 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 as a function of Sm3+ concentration
(Figure 4b), the maximum
RL output is found to be with 2.5% Sm3+ doping concentration,
which is similar to the PL results with quenching at higher concentrations.
The emission intensity of phosphors is strongly affected by the surface
defects present on nanostructured materials. There are two affecting
parameters for luminescence properties: surface defects and agglomeration.
Surface defects provide nonradiative pathways, whereas agglomeration
scatters incident and emitted light. Hence, increasing these parameters
reduces PL and RL intensities. Our SEM images show that there is a
gradual decrease of particle size from 70 to 22 nm with increasing
Sm3+ doping level from 0.5 to 10.0 mol % (Figure S3). The initial small decrease of the RL intensity
with the increase of Sm3+ doping from 0.5 to 1.0% is within
experimental error. The increase of RL intensity with the increase
of Sm3+ doping from 1.0 to 2.5% is endowed by enhanced
dopant concentration, which could overturn the negative effects by
the decreased particle size and increased surface defect. When the
Sm3+ doping level is higher than 2.5%, concentration quenching
governs the observed RL trend.

2.8 Thermographic
Performance of LHOS as a Phosphor
We have further investigated
the thermal stability of the LHOS
NPs and explored their potential application as TGPs by in situ PL
measurements from 298 to 1073 K (Figure 5a). The LHOS (2.5%) NPs are used as an example
because they possess the highest PL intensity. With increasing measurement
temperature, the PL emission intensity initially increases and then
decreases rather than monotonously decreases as normally seen from
various doped phosphors.38,40 Meanwhile, the well-resolved
PL peaks pertaining to the Sm3+ ion broaden until 773 K
(Figure 5b). The PL
peaks are masked by broad envelope in the measurement temperature
of 673–773 K, while the PL intensity is very weak between 973
and 1073 K. The broad envelope between 673 K up to 773 K may be attributed
to large density of thermal defects (such as cation vacancies and
cation interstitials) or oxygen vacancies, which can provide nonradiative
pathways.19,38,39 Another possible
reason may be the partial reduction of Sm3+ to Sm2+ at high temperature, which is known to display a broad emission
in the green region.67 Techniques to probe
defects in situ such as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy
and to detect the Sm3+ to Sm2+ reduction in
situ such as electron spin resonance spectroscopy would be helpful
in this regard. Such an instrumental setup is not available to us,
but we would try to seek collaborations in the future.

Of Sm3+-doped phosphors,
there are several nearly resonant
cross-relaxation pathways which would not demonstrate temperature
dependence.68 The temperature-dependent
change of PL emission intensity usually arises because the nonradiative
transition probability of some particular energy levels is also temperature-dependent.69 For our LHOS NPs, with the increase of PL measurement
temperature, nonradiative transition probability reduces up to 773
K,29,37 and therefore, the PL emission intensity
increases in the temperature range of 298–773 K. However, at
temperature higher than 773 K, there is a sudden thermal quench by
∼ 48% from 773 to 873 K (Figure 5c). This thermal quenching phenomenon occurs when phosphors
are supersaturated with thermal heat and can no longer convert the
excitation energy to visible light. Sudden and fast thermal quenching
at high temperatures is typical of phosphors such as the LHOS NPs
wherein nonresonant cross-relaxation channels (by about few hundred
wavenumbers) become resonant at high temperature because of energy
activation.68

We have extrapolated
the activation energy value by Arrhenius fitting
of the integrated PL intensity of 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 transition in the temperature range of 298–773
K based on eqs S6 and S7. The relationship
of  and 1/kT holds a linear
fit (Figure S7) with a slope of −0.153,
which is proportional to the involved activation energy of the LHOS-2.5
NPs. Therefore, the activation energy is equal to 0.153 eV for the
thermal quenching.

The absolute temperature sensitivity (Sa) is a vital parameter to quantitatively evaluate
the optical thermometric
ability of phosphors. Sa denotes the theoretical
variation rate in fluorescence intensity ratio with respect to temperature
and can be expressed by eq S8.

The
absolute temperature sensitivity of our LHOS NPs increases
with the increasing measurement temperature and reaches a maximum
value of 0.98 K–1 (Figure 5d).

Meanwhile, relative temperature
sensitivity (Sr) is another critical parameter
to quantify the temperature
sensing properties of thermometric materials. It is expressed by eq S9 as the relative change of the integrated
PL intensity (I) with respect to temperature (T).

There is a gradual decrease of the Sr value with increasing measurement temperature for 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 transition
of Sm3+ ions, which is similar to the trend observed from
GdVO4:Sm3+(Figure 5d).70 The Sr value from the LHOS NPs reaches a maximum
of 3.79 %
K–1, which is the highest compared with typical
temperature sensors (Table 1). The high activation energy and relatively good thermal
sensitivity of synthesized LHOS NPs could be attributed to (a) low
phonon energy of LHO, (b) high structural stability of LHO, and (c)
little lattice strain or charge compensating defects as the majority
of Sm3+ ions occupy La3+ sites because of similar
ionic radii and the same charge.

Thermographic
and display panel applications of phosphors require
them to possess high structural stability over a wide range of temperatures.
Other than in situ PL measurements, we have also taken in situ XRD
and Raman measurements on the LHOS (2.5%) NPs from 298 to 1148 and
1173 K, respectively (Figure S8). It is
clearly seen that the LHOS NPs are structurally stable. High thermal
stability of phosphors is favorable for luminescence thermometer application
with high PL and RL efficiencies.

3 Conclusions
In summary, our LHOS NPs displayed strong orange-red emission with
high color purity and low CCT under near-UV excitation at 405 nm,
which makes them compatible with commercial NUV light-emitting diodes.
The LHOS NPs are also applicable as an X-ray phosphor by converting
highly energetic X-ray into orange-red light. Interestingly, their
electronic and MDTs are different under UV and X-ray excitations.
Meanwhile, the LHOS NPs demonstrate highest thermal sensitivity among
typical temperature sensors. Therefore, the superior emission characteristics,
efficient RL output, and good thermal sensing capability make the
LHOS NPs potential candidates for multifunctional applications as
phosphors, scintillators, and luminescence thermometry.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of the LHOS NPs
A set of
six samples of LHO/x % Sm3+, where x = 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10, were prepared via a hybrid
coprecipitation and MSS. Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.0%), hafnium dichloride
oxide octahydrate (HfCl2O·8H2O, 98%), and
samarium nitrate (Sm(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.9%) were used as the starting reactants with no further purification.
They were mixed and dissolved in distilled water (18.2 MΩ at
25 °C) together at an appropriate stoichiometric ratio and kept
stirring for around 30 min. The solution was then titrated with 10%
ammonium hydroxide solution (diluted from 28 to 30% NH4OH) over a period of 2 h. The formed precipitate was then washed
with deionized water, filtered, dried, and then mixed with potassium
nitrate (KNO3, 99.9%) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 98%) in a stoichiometric ratio of (1:30:30). The mixture was finely
grinded using a mortal and a pestle before being annealed at 650 °C
for 6 h. The final resulting powder was washed and dried to obtain
the final pure LHOS NPs. The schematic of the synthesis process employed
for the LHOS NPs is depicted in Figure S1.

4.2 Characterization of the LHOS NPs
The XRD patterns were collected using a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer
with a Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm, 30 kV, and 15
mA). The scanning mode used was 2θ, with a scanning range from
10° to 90° and a scanning step size of 0.05° with a
scanning rate of 2° min–1. FTIR spectra were
collected using an FTIR ALPHA II’s Platinum ATR single reflection
diamond ATR module. Raman spectra were recorded on a Bruker SENTERRA
Raman spectrometer (Bruker Optics SENTERRA R200) using a 785 nm laser
with 100 mW power.

In situ Raman measurements were performed
using a custom-built micro-Raman setup. The samples were placed in
a high-temperature microscope stage (TS-1500, Linkam) and were excited
with a continuous wave diode-pumped solid-state laser (Excelsior,
Spectra Physics, 532 nm) through an upright microscope using a 50×
long-working distance objective with NA (numeric aperture) = 0.5.
The typical incident laser power on a sample was maintained at ∼100
μW. The scattered Raman light was analyzed by a spectrometer
(SpectraPro 2300i, Acton, f = 0.3 m) that was coupled
to the microscope and equipped with a 1800 grooves/mm grating and
a CCD camera (Pixis 256BR, Princeton Instruments).

The optical
properties of the NPs were evaluated using an Edinburgh
Instrument FLS 980 fluorometer system equipped with both a steady-state
and a pulsed Xe lamp source. The Xe-pulsed source has a frequency
range of 1–100 Hz. RL spectra were acquired with a silver target
as the X-ray source with λ = 0.52 Å at a power of 12 W
(60 kV and 200 μA). The silver target was adapted to the Edinburgh
Instruments FLS 980 fluorimeter system. No filters were used during
the process. Lead shielding was used to block the incoming radiation
lower than 2 mR/h.
