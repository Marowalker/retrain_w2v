Novel strategies
in the field of nanotechnology for the development
of suitable multifunctional drug delivery vehicles have been pursued
with promising upshots. Luminescent copper nanocluster-doped hydroxyapatite
nanoparticles (HAP NPs) were synthesized and applied for the delivery
of antibacterial drug kanamycin. The negatively charged doped HAP
NPs could electrostatically interact with the positively charged kanamycin.
The kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs showed pronounced activity in the
case of Gram-negative bacteria compared to that in Gram-positive bacteria.
Upon interaction with the bacteria, kanamycin could probably generate
harmful agents such as hydroxyl radical that leads to bacterial cell
damage. After being incorporated with copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs),
the doped HAP NPs were applied for the bioimaging of bacterial cells.
The biocompatibility of doped HAP NPs was also studied in HeLa cells.
As compared to copper nanoclusters, the doped HAP NPs showed excellent
biocompatibility even at higher concentrations of copper. The kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs were further applied toward Pseudomonas
aeruginosa biofilm eradication. Thus, the as-synthesized
copper nanocluster-doped HAP NPs were applied as nanocarriers for
antibiotic drug delivery, bioimaging, and antibiofilm applications.

Introduction
Multidrug resistance
in bacteria is an emerging serious concern,
which has been prevailing because of the development of resistant
genes, by the action of multidrug efflux pumps that eliminate the
uptaken drug, and through modification in the drug target site. The
cure of multidrug resistant bacterial infections demands multiple
treatments with a broad spectrum of drugs that are quite expensive
and toxic.1−4 Nanotechnology has become a promising field in handling the challenge
for the development of nano-sized materials that can vanquish such
serious threat to an extent. The increasing resistance of bacterial
strains toward a wide range of drugs has prompted the researchers
to pursue various drug delivery methods where focus has been driven
to sustained release of drug and biocompatibility of drug delivery
vehicles.5 There has been an accelerated
interest toward inorganic material-based nanoparticles as carriers,
which can be modified to resist enzymatic degradation with improved
affinity between carriers and macromolecules, sustained drug delivery,
and reduced renal clearance. Inorganic nanoparticles have got several
advantages over polymer-based nanocarrier systems and organic nanoparticles
by exhibiting multifunctionality, less toxicity, and lower immune
response. Unlike liposome-based carriers, they show lipase resistance
and stability toward bile salts.6,7

In nature, there
are a diverse range of highly ordered inorganic
materials with a well-defined structure, which can be manipulated
to engineer suitable nanocrystals.8 Hydroxyapatite
(HAP) among the inorganic materials is an important constituent in
the hard tissues of human such as bone and tooth. Being a bioceramic
material, it has excellent biocompatibility, nonimmunogenicity, and
high osteoconductivity, which make it an ideal material for bone implants
and dental implants. The chemical resemblance of HAP with the naturally
existing bone matrix enables it to be used in tissue regeneration
or bone implants. The excellent nanoscale properties of HAP, which
differ from that of their bulk form, have attained wider attention
in the area of inorganic nanoparticle-based applications.9,10 Importantly, the rough surface texture, high adsorption capacity,
and nontoxicity qualify their usage as in vitro and in vivo carriers
for proteins, growth factors, and drugs.11,12 The cell membrane penetrability and in vivo solubility favor HAP-based
nanocarriers to carry out both localized and systemic delivery of
drugs. HAP nanocarriers are found to facilitate sustained drug delivery
with appreciable therapeutic response.13,14 Studies had
been conducted to investigate the loading and release of bovine serum
albumin (BSA)15 and insulin16 from HAP nanoparticles (HAP NPs) and HAP-based
scaffolds, respectively. Investigations have revealed the loading
and release efficiency of drugs such as cisplatin17 and ibuprofen18 from HAP NPs.
In various studies, the HAP NPs are doped with different metal ions
for applications including loading and release of biomolecules, bioimaging,
biolabeling, as well as adsorption of toxic metal ions from the environment.19

One of the dominant, reliable, inexpensive,
and fast methods for
the detection of bacteria in the field of sensing technology is luminescence-based
detection. Metal nanoclusters comprising a few to hundred atoms are
excellent fluorescent materials with high photoluminescence, excellent
photostability, lower toxicity, and high water solubility. Among the
metal nanoclusters, copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) are explored with
great attention in the area of bioimaging in vitro and in vivo. Copper
nanoclusters have another advantage of being used in vivo as there
are cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the uptake and
efflux of copper unlike gold and silver metal ions.20−22 The HAP nanomaterial,
ideally not being a luminescent material, has been converted into
luminescent probes after doping it with organic dyes and lanthanides
for bioimaging and biolabeling applications. However, the HAP NPs
doped with lanthanides have limited in vivo applications because of
their toxicity, so as the case with organic dyes due to the drawbacks
of photobleaching and poor stability. HAP owing to its high biocompatibility
and adsorption property can be used for doping with metal nanoclusters
such as copper.23−25

Herein, we report the synthesis of copper nanocluster-doped
HAP
NPs, which acted as nanocarriers for antibacterial drug delivery (Scheme 1). The negatively
charged doped HAP NPs could be loaded with the positively charged
antibacterial drug kanamycin. Kanamycin is one of the aminoglycosides,
which can irreversibly bind with the 30S ribosomal subunit, further
inactivating the bacterium for the synthesis of vital protein required
for its growth. Having been included within the WHO list of important
medicines, kanamycin is considered as an essential antibiotic for
various bacterial infections.26 Here, the
drug loaded doped HAP NPs showing biphasic mode of antibacterial drug
release exhibited both antibacterial and antibiofilm property. The
as-synthesized doped HAP NPs were biocompatible, and they were also
found to be useful for the bioimaging of bacterial cells.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Kanamycin-Loaded Doped HAP NPs Which on Interacting
with Bacterial Cells Show Both Antibacterial and Bioimaging Potency
The structure of kanamycin sulfate
is shown (inset).

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
The experimental procedures detailed below
include the usage of the following chemicals as-purchased: calcium
chloride dihydrate (Merck), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (Merck),
strontium nitrate pure (Merck), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 400 (Merck),
ammonia 25% (Merck), hydrazine hydrate 80% (Merck), poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA) 87–89% hydrolyzed (Sigma-Aldrich), glacial acetic acid
(Rankem), sodium hydroxide pellet (Rankem), copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate
pure (Merck), BSA (Himedia), kanamycin sulfate (Himedia), Luria-Bertani
(LB) broth (Himedia), nutrient broth (NB) (Sigma-Aldrich), brain heart
infusion (BHI) broth (Sigma-Aldrich), and agar powder (bacteriological
grade, Himedia). Milli-Q grade water (>18 MΩ cm–1, Millipore) was used in all the experiments.

Synthesis of HAP NPs
The HAP NPs were synthesized by
a wet chemical synthesis method by slightly modifying a known protocol.27 In this synthesis, 0.2 M (0.176 g) calcium chloride
dihydrate, 0.12 M (0.098 g) potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and 0.12
M (0.15 g) strontium nitrate were mixed in 6 mL of water. While the
mixture was kept for stirring, 7 mL of PEG 400 was added into it.
The pH of the solution was adjusted to 11 by using 5 M NaOH. While
the pH was brought to 11, the mixture turned to a white turbid dispersion
and was allowed to stir for 10 min. This formed the first set of dispersion.
A second set of solution was prepared where 20 mL of PVA solution,
500 μL of 2.5% diluted glacial acetic acid, and 400 μL
of 0.5% ammonia were mixed together and stirred. Further, the second
set was added to the first set of dispersion and stirred for 10 min,
followed by heating at 85 °C for 2 min. Thereafter, the final
dispersion was cooled and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to remove
the unreacted PVA and PEG. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet
was washed and redispersed into water, followed by centrifugation
at the same speed for 5 min. The obtained pellet was suspended in
water and stored at 4 °C for further use. Instead of N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide reported in the referred protocol, we
have used PEG, which is reported to favor the formation of spherical
morphology of the HAP NPs.28 Moreover,
both PEG and PVA contribute to the biocompatibility and stability
of nanoparticles.

Synthesis of Copper Nanoclusters
The copper nanoclusters
were synthesized by modifying a known protocol.29 In this method, 300 mg of BSA was added to 30 mL of water,
followed by the addition of 30 mg of CuSO4. The reaction
was kept stirring, which led to the formation of bluish turbid dispersion.
To this, 1 M NaOH was added drop by drop, until the color of the medium
turned from blue to purple. Further, 180 μL of 80% hydrazine
hydrate was added to the purple colored solution, until the color
became pale brown. The entire reaction was kept stirring at 80 °C
for 15 min. After cooling down, the as-synthesized BSA-templated copper
nanoclusters were stored at 4 °C for further use.

Synthesis of
Doped HAP NPs
For the synthesis of the
doped HAP NPs, 0.2 M calcium chloride dihydrate and 0.12 M strontium
nitrate were mixed in 3 mL of water. To this, 7 mL of PEG 400 was
added and stirred. The pH was kept at 11 using 1 M NaOH. While the
reaction mixture was kept stirring, the synthesized copper nanocluster
dispersion was added, followed by the addition of 3 mL of 0.12 M potassium
dihydrogen phosphate. This formed the first set of dispersion. The
second set contained 20 mL of the PVA solution, where 500 μL
of 2.5% diluted glacial acetic acid and 400 μL of 0.5% ammonia
were mixed and stirred. The pH of the second solution was brought
to 11 using 1 M NaOH. Finally, the second set and the first set were
mixed together and heated at 85 °C for 2 min. After the synthesis,
the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was redispersed into water, centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and again redispersed in water. The final dispersion
was stored at 4 °C for further studies.

Drug-Binding Efficiency
of Doped HAP NPs
For performing
the binding experiment, different concentrations of doped HAP NPs
with varying calcium concentrations (0.76, 1.06, 2.28, and 3.04 mg/mL)
were taken with the addition of 500 μL of 20 mg/mL of kanamycin.
Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 45 min. By centrifuging
at 5000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and the binding
efficiency was checked by the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-sulfonic acid
(TNBS) assay.30

TNBS Assay
The
TNBS assay was used for the detection
of primary amines. The kanamycin standards ranging from 2, 5, 10,
15, 20, to 25 mg/mL were prepared. To each well in a 96-well plate,
20 μL of each standard as well as sample with the unknown concentration
of kanamycin was added, followed by the addition of 160 μL of
2% sodium bicarbonate to each well. Finally, we added 20 μL
of 1% TNBS to all the wells and waited for 5 min for the yellow color
to develop. After the color was developed, the absorbance was measured
at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader. Here, TNBS reacts with the
amino sugar moieties in kanamycin to give a product of trinitrophenylated
derivatives, which then could be spectrophotometrically detected at
450 nm. The efficiency was calculated by the following formula:  Here, KANi refers to the concentration
of drug used for binding and KANf refers to the concentration
of drug in the supernatant.

Release Kinetics of the Antibacterial Drug
The release
study was quantified in three different pHs, which include pH 4 (acetate
buffer), pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and pH 8.4 (PBS).
Initially, the doped HAP NPs loaded with kanamycin were incubated
for 45 min at 37 °C for binding to take place. After incubation,
centrifugation was carried out, and the supernatant was discarded.
The obtained pellet was redispersed in different pH buffers and incubated
at 37 °C up to 12 h. The sample was withdrawn at each time interval
and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected,
and kanamycin was released from the doped HAP NPs analyzed by the
TNBS assay.  

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
The absorbance characteristics
of the as-synthesized HAP NPs, copper nanoclusters, and doped HAP
NPs in the UV–vis range were recorded using UV–visible
spectroscopy (by using a Jasco V-630 spectrophotometer).

Luminescence
Measurements
All the luminescence measurements
were recorded by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (by using a PerkinElmer
LS55 spectrofluorometer).

Quantum Yield Measurements
The quantum
yield measurements
of doped HAP NPs were carried out using a standard protocol. Quinine
sulfate in 0.1 M H2SO4 was used as a reference
for the study. On the basis of the following equation, the quantum
yield was calculated for doped HAP NPs.  Here, QY refers to the quantum yield of doped
HAP NPs, QYr refers to the quantum yield of quinine sulfate,
which was used as a reference, m and mr refer to the slope of plot obtained from integrated
luminescence intensity versus absorbance for doped HAP NPs and quinine
sulfate, respectively, and n and nr refer to the refractive indices of doped HAP NPs and
quinine sulfate, respectively. QYr has a quantum yield
of 0.54, and solvent (water) has a refractive index of 1.33.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
The as-synthesized
HAP NPs, copper nanoclusters, and doped HAP NPs were analyzed under
a transmission electron microscope, which was operating at a maximum
accelerating voltage of 200 keV (JEM 2100; JEOL, Peabody, MA). For
the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, 7 μL of
the sample was drop-cast to a carbon-coated copper grid and air-dried
overnight. The HAP NPs and doped HAP NPs were sonicated in an ultrasonic
bath (TELSONIC) for 40 min before drop-casting on the grid.

Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
The surface
morphology of doped HAP NPs was studied using field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) (JEOL JSM-7610F). The sample for FESEM
was prepared by drop-casting 20 μL of the sample to an aluminum
foil-covered glass slide and air-drying it overnight. The sample was
sonicated for 40 min before being drop-cast.

The morphologies
of both treated and control bacteria were also studied using FESEM.
During the analysis, the bacteria were treated with kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs at their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Both
the treated and control bacteria were incubated for 10 h at 37 °C
(180 rpm). For analysis, 100 μL of the culture was taken and
centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 1 min. After the removal of the
supernatant, the pellet was washed and suspended in water. A 20 μL
of the diluted culture was drop-cast on an aluminum foil-covered glass
slide and air-dried overnight.

Zeta Potential
The zeta potential of doped HAP NPs,
undoped HAP NPs, copper nanoclusters, and kanamycin-loaded doped HAP
NPs was recorded using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS.

Atomic Absorption
Spectroscopy
The amount of copper
present in the doped HAP NPs was determined using an atomic absorption
spectrophotometer (AA240-Varian Inc.).

Liquid Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry
Using
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (Q-Tof
Premier), the interaction of kanamycin with kanamycin-loaded doped
HAP NPs was studied. The analysis was carried out for kanamycin, kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs, and doped HAP NPs.

Biocompatibility Assay
of Doped HAP NPs
The biocompatibility
study was done on HeLa cells by carrying out the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. For the assay, 1 × 104 HeLa cells/well
were seeded into a 96-well plate and cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) inside a 5% CO2 humidified
incubator overnight at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were treated
with copper nanoclusters and doped HAP NPs of varying copper concentrations
(ranging from 1 to 10 μg/mL). The treated cells were incubated
overnight at 37 °C for 24 h. The MTT assay was carried out after
24 h. The respiratory mitochondrial enzyme in the live cells reduces
the MTT to a formazan product, which can be detected spectrophotometrically
at 570 nm with the reference filter at 655 nm. The amount of formazan
formed is directly proportional to the number of live cells. The percentage
(%) of cell viability was calculated as follows:  

Antibacterial Studies
For the antibacterial
studies,
the following strains were used, which include Gram-positive bacteria
(Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96 and Bacillus subtilis MTCC 1305) and Gram-negative bacteria
[green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing recombinant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 2488, and E. coli DH5α]. S. aureus MTCC 96 was grown in BHI at 37 °C
(180 rpm) for 12 h. B. subtilis MTCC
1305 and P. aeruginosa MTCC 2488 were
propagated in NB at 37 °C (180 rpm) for 12 h. GFP expressing
recombinant E. coli was grown in ampicillin
containing LB media at 37 °C (180 rpm) for 12 h and E. coli DH5α was grown in LB at 37 °C
(180 rpm) for 12 h. The bacterial strains were treated with different
concentrations of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs (kanamycin concentration
ranging from 3 to 50 μg/mL) and free kanamycin (3 to 50 μg/mL).
The bacterial growth was monitored by recording the optical density
(OD) at 595 nm using the UV–visible spectrophotometer (Jasco
V-630). The measurements were recorded in triplicates.

Further,
the MIC and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were again
confirmed by plating the bacteria on nutrient agar media. Here, 100
μL of bacteria treated with the MIC and MBC of kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs was spread-plated on the media using L-rod. Similarly,
the bacteria treated with the MIC and MBC of free kanamycin were also
plated and incubated. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C
for 12 h.

Growth Kinetics Study
The growth
curve was analyzed
for P. aeruginosa MTCC 2488 after treating
the bacteria with the MIC and MBC of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs
and free kanamycin, followed by monitoring the growth for 12 h at
37 °C (180 rpm).

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
The confocal experiment
was done by treating the bacterial cells with doped HAP NPs at the
MIC of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs and incubating for 3 h at 37
°C (180 rpm). The samples were viewed under a Zeiss LSM 880 microscope
(at an excitation of 365 nm).

Bacterial Biofilm Assay
The bacteria were diluted to
1 × 106 cfu/mL using the NB media from which 100 μL
of bacteria was added to a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C
in static condition. After 24 h, the medium was removed and fresh
medium was added. To this, different concentrations of kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs (kanamycin concentration ranging from 12 to 400 μg/mL)
and free kanamycin (concentration ranging from 12 to 400 μg/mL)
were added and incubated for 12 h. After incubation, the medium was
removed, and biofilm was stained with 0.01% crystal violet. The stained
biofilm was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The crystal violet
was dissolved using 95% ethanol, and the absorbance was measured at
595 nm using the microplate reader. The measurements were recorded
in triplicates.31

Lipid Content Detection
The bacteria grown overnight
were diluted to 1 × 106 cfu/mL, and 100 μL was
then added to the 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. Following
incubation, the biofilm was treated with kanamycin-loaded doped HAP
NPs at their minimum biofilm inhibition concentration (MBIC50) and incubated for 12 h. The cells were stained with 0.01 mg/mL
of Nile red and incubated in dark. The excess dye was removed, and
imaging was carried out with an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon
ECLIPSE, TS100, Tokyo) at an excitation filter of 540/25 nm.

Acridine
Orange/Propidium Iodide Dual Staining Assay
The bacteria
were grown overnight, and the culture was diluted to
1 × 106 cfu/mL. A 100 μL of the diluted culture
was added to the 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. After incubation,
the grown biofilm was treated with kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs
at their MBIC50 and incubated for 12 h. The biofilm was
then gently washed and stained with 0.01 mg/mL of propidium iodide
(PI) and 0.01 mg/mL of acridine orange (AO), followed by the incubation
in dark. The excess dye was removed, and imaging was done at an excitation
filter of 465–495 nm for AO and 540/25 nm for PI.

Results
and Discussion
The as-synthesized doped HAP NP dispersion
was turbid and brown
in color. The UV–vis spectrum of doped HAP NPs, HAP NPs (undoped),
or copper nanoclusters (Figure 1A) did not exhibit any significant peak in the visible region
of wavelengths. However, a peak could be observed at around 280 nm
in the case of doped HAP NPs or copper nanoclusters. The observed
peak at 280 nm in the case of doped HAP NPs is attributed to BSA,
which is used as the template in the synthesis of copper nanoclusters
and thus suggests the incorporation of BSA-templated copper nanoclusters
into HAP NPs. Importantly, copper nanoclusters, when excited at 365
nm, exhibited an emission peak at around 650 nm (Figure 1B). A similar luminescence
emission peak was also observed at 650 nm when doped HAP NPs were
excited at 365 nm. This also indicated successful incorporation of
BSA-templated copper nanoclusters into HAP NPs. As compared to the
copper nanoclusters, the doped HAP NPs exhibited apparent higher luminescence
intensity. This was resulted probably due to the aggregation-induced
emission enhancement of nanoclusters.32,33

HAP NPs, and doped HAP NPs. (B) Emission spectra of copper nanoclusters
and doped HAP NPs showing the emission peak at 650 nm when excited

(D) TEM image of a single doped HAP NP showing incorporated copper
nanoclusters at 20 nm scale bar.

Additionally, the photostability study revealed that the
doped
HAP NPs were comparatively more stable than copper nanoclusters or
the organic luminescent dye rhodamine 6G (Figure S1A). In the case of doped HAP NPs, there was reduction in
the luminescent intensity (F/F0) at a rate of only 1.06% per minute. However, copper nanoclusters
and the organic dye showed the decrease of intensity at a rate of
1.4% per minute and 1.8% per minute, respectively. The stability of
doped HAP NPs toward photobleaching can be considered for their bioimaging
application. Using quinine sulfate as the reference, the quantum yield
of doped HAP NPs was obtained to be 1.2% (Figure S1B) and thus can be considered for bioimaging applications.34 TEM images revealed doped HAP NPs (Figure 1C,D) and undoped
HAP NPs (Figure S2A) with an average size
of 32.64 ± 7.0 and 24.0 ± 6.0 nm, respectively. Likewise,
the average size of copper nanoclusters (Figure S2B) was measured to be 1.75 ± 0.3 nm. The copper nanoclusters
incorporated into doped HAP NPs were found to have an average size
of 1.71 ± 0.5 nm, which is almost similar to the size of as-synthesized
copper nanoclusters. The size calculations were carried out using
the ImageJ software. The comparatively larger size of the doped HAP
NPs might be probably due to the incorporation of copper nanoclusters,
which contains the high-molecular-weight BSA as the template. Thus,
from the TEM images obtained, it was confirmed that the copper nanoclusters
were successfully incorporated into the doped HAP NPs. The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns obtained for doped (300),
(310), and (410) and undoped HAP NPs (310), (320), and (410) corroborated
the formation of HAP material as per the earlier reports35 (Figure S2C,D). The
copper nanoclusters themselves did not show any significant SAED pattern
(Figure S2E). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
image of the doped HAP NPs (Figure S2F)
exhibited a lattice spacing of 0.34 nm that corresponds to the (002)
plane of HAP.36

The energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis revealed
the presence of metal ions used in the synthesis of doped and undoped
HAP NPs (Figure S3A−C). The elemental
composition confirms the presence of calcium, phosphorous, strontium,
and copper ions at higher amount in doped HAP NPs. The FESEM images
obtained further revealed the formation of doped HAP NPs with an average
size of 32.07 ± 7.0 nm (Figure S4A,B). The size calculated using the ImageJ software corresponded with
the sizes obtained by TEM analysis. The zeta potential analysis confirmed
that doped HAP NPs had a net negative charge of −3.14 ±
0.17 mV (Figure S5A). Also, both undoped
HAP NPs and BSA-templated copper nanoclusters had zeta potential values
of −0.08037 ± 0.03 and −4.17 ± 0.7 mV, respectively
(Figure S5B,C). Further, kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs were found to possess a negative charge of −2.3
± 0.58 mV (Figure S5D). The reduction
in the negative charge of the kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs as compared
to doped HAP NPs was due to bound kanamycin, which is positively charged.
This result suggests that kanamycin was successfully loaded into the
doped HAP NPs. The negative charge on the nanoparticles is beneficial
to be used as a drug cargo where positively charged drug can be loaded
through electrostatic interaction. The negatively charged nanoparticles
exhibit reduced adsorption of plasma protein on their surface. This
in fact leads to reduced opsonization and reduced clearance of the
nanoparticles from the blood stream, retaining their circulation for
a longer time period. It would also aid in reduced nonspecific cellular
uptake, unlike the positively charged nanoparticles.37,38 Following this, atomic absorption spectroscopy was carried out,
and the copper concentration in doped HAP NPs was found to be 37.8
μg/mL (Figure S6). The LC–MS
analysis exhibited an m/z value
of 483.26 for free kanamycin, which corroborated with the m/z value (483.27) of kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs (Figure S7A,B). However,
similar values were not obtained for the doped HAP NPs (Figure S7C). Thus, the result obtained from LC–MS
suggested the interaction of kanamycin with kanamycin-loaded doped
HAP NPs.39

The luminescence characteristics
exhibited by doped HAP NPs led
to exploring its bioimaging aptness in the bacterial cells probing
through confocal microscopy. The bacteria were treated for 3 h at
37 °C, and the imaging was done at an excitation filter of 365
nm. The images obtained showed the control bacterial cells with no
luminescence (Figure S8A–C). However,
luminescence was observed in the case of doped HAP NP-treated bacterial
cells, implying the fact that doped HAP NPs had been successfully
incorporated in the bacteria (Figure 2A–C). The interaction between doped HAP NPs
and the bacteria could be due to the influence of bridging of calcium
ions with the bacterial cell wall.40 As
inferred from the confocal images, the as-synthesized doped HAP NPs
were found to be attractive candidates for the bioimaging of bacterial
cells. Such a nanoparticle-based bacterial imaging system would be
highly advantageous in identifying pathological strains in clinical
diagnosis and environmental monitoring without having to resort to
time-consuming procedures.41

Figure 2 Confocal images
showing the bacterial uptake of doped HAP NPs.
(A) Fluorescence image, (B) bright-field image, and (C) merged image
of treated bacteria. The bacteria were treated with doped HAP NPs
at the MIC of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs. The images were taken
at a scale bar of 5 μm. An excitation filter of 365 nm was used
for imaging.

Besides the bioimaging
property, the doped HAP NPs were investigated
for their efficiency to act as nanocarriers for antibacterial drug
delivery. The as-synthesized doped HAP NPs, which had a negative charge,
were loaded with the antibacterial drug kanamycin sulfate. The efficiency
of the doped HAP NPs to bind with kanamycin was investigated using
the TNBS assay. The binding efficiency of doped HAP NPs was found
to be 57%, and the concentration of bound kanamycin was found to be
9.3 mg/mL. To quantify the in vitro release of kanamycin from doped
HAP NPs, the release profile was studied. The time-dependent release
profile (Figure 3A–C)
showed that the kanamycin release was found to be more significant
in acidic pH 4 with a maximum release of 62% at 6th h and gradually
reducing to 40% at the end of 12th h. At pH 7.4, a maximum release
of only 6% was found at 8th h, which gradually was reduced by 12th
h. At pH 8.4, 18% of release was observed at 6th h, which remained
constant up to 8th h followed by slow reduction and finally became
constant up to 12th h. Here, a biphasic release pattern was observed
at the acidic pH (pH 4) with an initial burst release, followed by
the sustained release of antibiotic drug. An initial burst release
is important to prevent the intruded bacteria from initiating their
proliferation, thereby eliminating them from the infectious sites.
The sustained release would further inhibit the infection with reduced
toxicity having effective therapeutic index and reduced wastage of
drug. The extended antibiotic delivery is also found to be advantageous
over long-term oral antibiotic intake.42−44 The sustained release
of kanamycin observed after 6th h at acidic pH (pH 4) is fortuitous
for its action against pathogenic bacteria growing at acidic conditions.

Figure 3 Antibacterial
drug release study carried out at (A) pH 4 (acetate
buffer), (B) pH 7.4 (PBS), and (C) pH 8.4 (PBS). The release study
suggested maximum release at acidic pH 4 (62% at 6th h) as compared
to release conducted at pH 7.4 (6% at 8th h) and pH 8.4 (18% at 6th
h).

Cell cytotoxicity study is essential
in understanding the biocompatibility
of doped HAP NPs for their application as nanocarriers. The investigations
performed revealed that the as-synthesized copper nanoclusters were
toxic even at their lowest concentration (copper concentration of
1 μg/mL), whereas when doped into the HAP NPs, the toxicity
was found to be negligible. Interestingly, when HeLa cells were treated
with doped HAP NPs with varying copper concentrations (ranging from
1 to 10 μg/mL), the cells were observed to be viable up to 10 μg/mL
of copper with minimum toxicity (Figure 4). The procured result suggested that the
doped HAP NPs qualify for their use in bioimaging applications.

Figure 4 Biocompatibility
of doped HAP NPs carried out on HeLa cells at
different concentrations. The HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM after
treatment with different concentrations of copper nanocluster-doped
HAP NPs (with varying copper concentrations) and only copper nanoclusters.
The MTT assay was carried out after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C.
The cells were found to be viable upon treating with copper nanocluster-doped
HAP NPs having a concentration of copper up to 10 μg/mL, whereas
only copper nanoclusters even at their lowest copper concentration
(1 μg/mL) exhibited significant toxicity toward cells. The statistical
significance between copper nanocluster-doped HAP NP-treated samples
and copper nanocluster-treated samples was revealed by the analysis
of variance (ANOVA) test, which is denoted by **** (p < 0.0001). The values are represented as mean ± standard
deviation (SD) of three individual experiments.

After successful loading of kanamycin, the antibacterial
activity
was further investigated. The antibacterial study was carried out
on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria where the selected
Gram-positive strains included S. aureus MTCC 96 and B. subtilis MTCC 1305.
Gram-negative strains included GFP expressing recombinant E. coli, P. aeruginosa MTCC 2488, and E. coli DH5α.
The MIC obtained for the kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs and free kanamycin
for all the selected bacteria is given in the table (Table S1). Among all the bacteria that were treated, the MIC
of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs obtained for P. aeruginosa MTCC 2488 was found to be the least. Thus, for further studies,
the Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa MTCC 2488 was selected. Among the various concentrations tested,
the minimum concentration of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs that measurably
inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa was considered as the MIC. Further, by reinoculating from the culture,
which lacked turbidity to a fresh medium, the MBC for the kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs was confirmed. The growth curve studies on P. aeruginosa revealed that at MIC (12 μg/mL)
of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs, there was arrest of bacterial growth,
and at its MBC (35 μg/mL), the growth was completely prevented.
The free kanamycin exhibited an MIC and MBC of 3 and 6 μg/mL,
respectively (Figure 5A). As observed in the figure (Figure 5A), there was no bactericidal activity for doped HAP
NPs unlike kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs. The bacteria were plated
on nutrient agar media to further confirm the MIC and MBC where only
few bacterial colonies were observed in the case of kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs at their MIC and no bacterial colony at their MBC (Figure S9A–C). Similar results were obtained
when bacteria were treated with the MIC and MBC of free kanamycin
(Figure S9D,E).

Figure 5 (A) Growth curve study
showing the inhibitory and killing effect
of doped HAP NPs, kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs, and free kanamycin
on P. aeruginosa by measuring the OD
at 595 nm. The kanamycin concentration was 12 μg/mL (MIC) and
35 μg/mL (MBC) in kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs, 3 μg/mL
(MIC), and 6 μg/mL (MBC) in free kanamycin and 0 μg/mL
in doped HAP NPs. (B) Antibiofilm activity of both kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs and free kanamycin on P. aeruginosa. The ANOVA test revealed the statistical significance of kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NP-treated samples and free kanamycin-treated samples with
respect to control sample. Statistical significance is denoted by
* (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.005),
*** (p < 0.001), and **** (p <
0.0001). The data are represented as mean ± SD of three individual
experiments. (C) Epifluorescence image of P. aeruginosa biofilm stained with Nile red at an excitation and emission wavelength
of 540/25 nm and 605/55 nm, respectively. (I) Control biofilm and
biofilm treated with (II) kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs. The corresponding
bright-field image of (III) control biofilm and biofilm treated with
(IV) kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs at their MBIC50 for
12 h. The control biofilm having high lipid content exhibited high
fluorescence, whereas diminished fluorescence was observed in the
treated biofilm because of reduced lipid content. The epifluorescence
images were taken at a scale bar of 100 μm.

The pattern of activity exhibiting slightly higher detrimental
effect of free drug than the drug-loaded carrier is found to be similar
with various previously reported studies conducted on nanocarrier-based
drug delivery.45−49 The higher MIC of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs as compared to
the lower MIC of free kanamycin was probably due to the partial release
of kanamycin from the kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs.50 The antibiotics bound to nanocarriers have several merits
over free antibiotics in terms of reduced side effects and stability.
Such antibiotic-loaded nanocarriers are beneficial as they play the
role of protecting the bound antibiotic from early degradation upon
interacting with molecules present in the physiological environment.51−53

Further, the interaction of kanamycin loaded doped HAP NPs
with
bacteria was studied using the FESEM analysis. When compared with
control bacterial cells, which had smooth cell surfaces (Figure S10A), the treated bacterial cell showed
disrupted cell wall (Figure S10B) because
of their interaction with kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs. This strongly
suggested that the kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs could effectively
release kanamycin that interacted with the bacteria. The kanamycin
could probably use the internal iron from the iron–sulfur cluster,
leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals mediated by the tricarboxylic
acid cycle. This finally results in the depletion of NADH and cell
damage.54

The bactericidal activity
and the higher susceptibility of P. aeruginosa over all other tested bacterial species
toward as-synthesized kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs suggested their
use in advanced applications. This led us to investigate the activity
of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs against P. aeruginosa biofilm as a proof of principle for application of these nanocarriers
in antibiofilm activity. Adhesion of bacteria followed by their colonization
and formation of biofilms on either animate or inanimate surfaces
can cause serious complications which are actively studied upon.55P. aeruginosa, being an opportunistic pathogen, is capable of forming robust biofilms
and is responsible for various life-threatening infections.56 The antibiofilm studies carried out on P. aeruginosa at different concentrations of kanamycin
(12, 35, 100, and 400 μg/mL) revealed 50% (MBIC50) inhibition by the kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs at a concentration
of 400 μg/mL (Figure 5B). Treatment with free kanamycin exhibited 50% (MBIC50) inhibition at 100 μg/mL. The results obtained for
the antibiofilm activity corroborated the results of antibacterial
studies conducted on P. aeruginosa.

The antibiofilm activity was further characterized by epifluorescence
imaging where Nile red staining was used to study the lipid content. P. aeruginosa being a Gram-negative bacterium possesses
an outer membrane highly rich in lipid content.57 In the case of the control biofilm, the epifluorescence
images obtained showed high lipid content covering almost the entire
area of individual wells in a 96-well plate emitting high fluorescence
(Figure 5C(I)). In
the case of the biofilm treated with the MBIC50 (400 μg/mL)
of kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs, reduced fluorescence intensity
(Figure 5C(II)) was
observed. This suggested that kanamycin released from the doped HAP
NPs could prevent the proliferation of bacteria, leading to reduced
biofilm mass as indicated by the diminished lipid content. The bright-field
image of the control biofilm and biofilm treated with kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs is shown (Figure 5C(III,IV)). The epifluorescence images showing Nile red stained
biofilm treated with free kanamycin are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S11A,B).

The dual staining
study carried out using the AO/PI dyes indicated
that the kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs could reduce the biofilm mass.
As visualized, the control cells after being treated with AO/PI dual
stain could take up the stains and emit out green fluorescence because
of the uptake of AO stain by live bacterial cells. There was only
negligible red fluorescence (due to PI) from the control cells, possibly
due to very less number of dead bacterial cells (Figure 6A(I–III)). In the case
of the biofilm treated with the MBIC50 of kanamycin-loaded
doped HAP NPs (Figure 6B(I–III)), a prominent red fluorescence could be visualized
possibly due to the penetration of PI stain through the damaged bacterial
cell membrane. Only a limited area showed green fluorescence where
few viable bacterial cells were present. The epifluorescence images
of the biofilm treated with free kanamycin are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S12A–C).
From the epifluorescence characterization, the reduction in the biofilm
mass observed by both Nile red and AO/PI-based staining suggested
that doped HAP NPs releasing kanamycin are promising therapeutic agents
against recurrent biofilm infections.

Figure 6 [A(I–III)] Epifluorescence images
of AO/PI stained control
biofilm: [A(I)] AO stained, [A(II)] PI stained, and [A(III)] merged
image. The arrows in the merged image of the control biofilm denote
the regions with dead and live bacterial cells. [B(I–III)]
biofilm treated with kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs: [B(I)] AO stained,
[B(II)] PI stained, and [B(III)] merged image. The arrows in the merged
image of the treated biofilm denote the regions with dead and live
bacterial cells. The excitation/emission of AO is 465–495/515–55
nm. PI was excited at 540/25 nm with an emission at 605/55 nm. For
imaging, the biofilm was treated with kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs
at their MBIC50 for 12 h. The control biofilm with a negligible
number of dead bacterial cells emitted green fluorescence because
of AO uptake by live bacterial cells. The red fluorescence emitted
from the treated biofilm is due to dead bacterial cells stained by
PI. The images were taken at a scale bar of 100 μm.

Conclusions
In brief, HAP NPs were
synthesized and further doped with luminescent
copper nanoclusters. The doped HAP NPs being negatively charged were
successfully loaded with positively charged antibacterial drug kanamycin.
Having been explored for their antibacterial activity against both
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the kanamycin-loaded doped
HAP NPs were found to be more effective against Gram-negative bacteria
as compared to Gram-positive bacteria. The doping of luminescent copper
nanoclusters on the as-synthesized HAP NPs endowed the entire nanoformulation
with the possibility of bioimaging of bacterial cells. The investigation
on biocompatibility of doped HAP NPs in HeLa cells revealed their
negligible toxic nature even at higher concentrations of copper. This
result was in contradiction with the significant toxicity exhibited
on HeLa cells by copper nanoclusters at their lowest copper concentration.
The sustained release of kanamycin from kanamycin-loaded doped HAP
NPs was found to eradicate P. aeruginosa biofilm. Thus, the present copper nanocluster-doped HAP NPs qualify
to be used as a drug cargo as a proof of principle for application
in nanocarrier-based antibiotic delivery with bioimaging property,
antibacterial, and antibiofilm applications.
