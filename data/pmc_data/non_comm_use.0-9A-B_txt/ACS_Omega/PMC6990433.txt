Mouse–mouse hybridoma cell
lines producing stable, highly specific monoclonal antibodies with
good affinity for the cardiac glycoside digoxin (DIG) were established
to construct an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lateral-flow
immunochromatographic strip to detect DIG in human blood. The hapten
DIG was coupled to bovine serum albumin or chicken ovalbumin by sodium
periodate oxidation. The highest sensitivity and specificity antibody
had a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.45 ng/mL,
a linear range of detection of 0.293–0.7 ng/mL, and low cross-reactivity
with several DIG analogues. The cut-off value of the lateral-flow
immunochromatographic strip was 5 ng/mL when the strip was tested
with human blood. The immunochromatographic lateral flow strip test
provides a quick and convenient method for determining DIG in plasma
which can be visually observed in only 5 min to promote rational drug
use.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Digoxin (DIG) is a cardiac
glycoside extracted from the leaf of the Digitalis
lanata plant that binds Na+/K+-ATPase and inhibits its activity. It is the most frequently used
digitalis-based cardiac-active drug for the treatment of congestive
heart failure (HF) and supraventricular arrhythmias.1,2 HF remains a huge medical problem, with unacceptably high morbidity
and mortality rates, despite optimal medical and mechanical treatment.
DIG significantly reduced the risk of all-cause hospital admission
in patients with HF during a mean follow-up period of 37 months and
reduced the left ventricular ejection fraction.3,4 However,
its mechanism of action is complex, its therapeutic index is low,
and its effective therapeutic range is narrow (only 0.8–2.0
ng mL–1), so any small increase in plasma levels
can have serious adverse effects, and the optimal blood concentration
is 0.5–0.8 ng mL–1. Therefore, the patient’s
plasma DIG levels must be monitored during its clinical use.5,6 The therapeutic dose is very close to the toxic amount (60% of the
poisoning dose), so the safety factor is small, and individual differences
in the responses of different patients to DIG treatment are extremely
large. Therefore, the conventional dose of DIG sometimes also causes
poisoning, and the clinical manifestations of overdosing and underdosing
are similar. Consequently, the incidence of poisoning during its clinical
application is high.7,8

In the past few years, the
analytical methods commonly used to monitor the blood concentrations
of DIG have predominantly included liquid chromatography (LC)–fluorescence
detection,9 high-performance LC,10 gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(MS),11 laborious radio-immunoassays,12 LC–MS, and LC–tandem MS (LC–MS/MS).13 The main technique adopted in China is the fluorescence
polarization immunoassay, which is fast, accurate, sensitive, and
specific, but expensive. This immunoassay is highly sensitive in detecting
DIG concentrations in vivo, requires smaller than usual samples, is
simple and rapid, can be performed in batches, and is widely used
in clinical practice. Therefore, this is still the main direction
taken in the development of therapeutic drug monitoring technologies.14,15

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the
ability to process huge numbers of samples with high sensitivity and
specificity and convenience.16−18 The most effective way to prevent
DIG poisoning is to apply an anti-DIG antibody.19,20 In recent years, anti-DIG antibodies also play an important role
in molecular biology hybridization techniques and can be used to detect
all nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates labeled by DIG, for
example, Teles et al. developed an in situ hybridization assay to
detect the MDM2 gene amplification by using a dinitrophenyl-labeled
MDM2 probe and a DIG-labeled CHR12 probe on an automated slide staining
platform at Ventana Medical Systems.21,22 Although polyclonal
antibodies are sensitive and specific, they are not widely used in
the market because they have poor reproducibility. Furthermore, anti-DIG
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been shown to be more useful than
polyclonal antisera in the clinical management of patients with heart
disease and in reversing the toxicity of digitalis. Therefore, a highly
sensitive and specific-mAb-based indirect competitive ELISA (ic-ELISA)
for the detection of DIG is essential. The lateral-flow immunochromatographic
strip, which is established on the competitive format of the ic-ELISA,
is undoubtedly most convenient for on-site analyses and high-throughput
sample processing, and has been widely adopted for the analysis of
chemicals.23−26

To ensure the safety of DIG in clinical use and improve the
rational level of its use, we established lateral-flow immunochromatographic
strip which was based on highly sensitive and specific mAb to detect
the concentration of DIG in plasma. It provides a simple, fast, sensitive,
and accurate measurement of the blood concentration of DIG for use
in clinical monitoring and research.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electrophoresis Characterization
DIG has a relative molecular mass of about 781 and is not immunogenic,
so it is a hapten. Therefore, this small-molecule hapten must be coupled
to a macromolecular protein to prepare an artificial DIG antigen.
DIG was coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or ovalbumin (OVA) by
sodium periodate oxidation to produce the immunogen and the coating
antigen for immunochromatographic strips. In this study, we used electrophoresis
to characterize the antigen. The results of their characterization
are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 1 Synthesis of the DIG hapten.

Figure 2 Electrophoresis of different antigens. (a) 1: BSA, 2: DIG–BSA
and (b) 1: OVA, 2: DIG–OVA.

2.2 Preparation and Characterization of mAb
After the fifth immunization with the immunogen, the mouse with the
highest serum antibody titer and lowest IC50 (5 ng/mL)
were selected for cell fusion. The hybridomas were screened with an
ic-ELISA and isolated with the limiting dilution method.

In
this study, three anti-DIG cell lines 1H2, 1H3, and 2D12 were produced,
and 1H3 had the highest sensitivity and specificity. The standard
curve (Figure 3) was
established for mAb 1H3 with the equation y = 0.293
+ 1.496/(1 + [x/0.453]3.102) and the linear
regression correlation coefficient (R2) was 0.999. The IC50 value was 0.45 ng/mL and the linear
range was 0.293–0.7 ng/mL.

Figure 3 Standard curve obtained by ic-ELISA based
on antibody 1H3.

2.3 Cross-Reactivity
The cross-reactivity (CR) of an antibody, which is its ability
to recognize other similar or different substances, is a measure of
its specificity. To evaluate the mAb specificity, its CR with digitoxin,
cortisol, estradiol, dexamethasone, testosterone, progesterone, estrone,
and ouabain was measured. As shown in Table 1, 1H3 is the most cross-reactive with digitoxin
among these substances closely related to DIG, but digitoxin is not
a natural compound of human blood, its presence in tested samples
accords to pharmaceutical application and is known before the assay,
and the CR with other DIG analogues does not exceed 2.3%. Therefore,
we inferred that the mAb produced was highly specific.

Table 1 Cross-Reaction Results of mAb 1H3
2.4 Characterization of the Immunochromatographic
Strip for DIG with Human Blood
As can be seen in Figure 4, among the three
cell lines isolated in this study (1H2, 1H3, and 2D12), 1H3 was most
effective, and was used in the subsequent experiments.

Figure 4 Detection of three anti-DIG
cell lines 1H2, 1H3, and 2D12 by lateral-flow immunochromatographic
assay (ICA) strip in PBS sample (1 = 0 ppb, 2 = 0.5 ppb).

Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) samples and serum samples
spiked with different concentrations of DIG were analyzed with the
lateral-flow immunochromatographic strip (Figure 5). It can be seen from Figure 5 that the visual limit of detection of the
sample is less than 0.5 ng/mL, which is lower than the optimal blood
concentration of the human body and has practical detection significance.

Figure 5 DIG detection
by lateral-flow ICA strip in PBS sample (a) and human blood sample
(a) 1 = 0 ng/mL, 2 = 0.25 ng/mL, 3 = 0.5 ng/mL, 4 = 1 ng/mL, 5 = 2.5
ng/mL, and 6 = 5 ng/mL; the cut-off value for DIG was 5 ng/mL. (b)
1 = 0 ng/mL, 2 = 0.1 ng/mL, 3 = 0.25 ng/mL, 4 = 0.5 ng/mL, 5 = 1 ng/mL,
6 = 2.5 ng/mL and 7 = 5 ng/mL; the cut-off value for DIG was 5 ng/mL.

The cut-off values for the serum samples were essentially
the same as those for the PBS samples, indicating that there was little
matrix interference when actual samples were tested. Therefore, the
developed lateral-flow immunochromatographic strip is suitable for
the detection of DIG in actual samples.

2.5 DIG Recovery
Test in Serum Samples
The concentrations of DIG mixed into
the serum samples were 3, 5, and 7 ng/mL. As shown in Table 2, the recovery rates were 95.7–105.4%
and the coefficients of variation were 5.37–8.42%, indicating
that the developed method is stable, accurate, and can be used for
the detection of DIG in serum samples.

3 Conclusions
The hapten DIG was conjugated to BSA or OVA by sodium periodate
oxidation in this experiment. A mAb, 1H3, with high specificity and
maximum sensitivity for DIG, was successfully produced with this hapten,
and was used to develop a colloidal gold test strip. The IC50 value of mAb DIG-1H3 was 0.45 ng/mL, its linear range was 0.293–0.7
ng/mL, and it showed low CR with several DIG analogues. Furthermore,
our DIG-1H3-based immunochromatographic strip directly detected DIG
in serum samples, and therefore is more rapid than other methods,
with visible results produced in only 5 min. It also showed good stability
and sensitivity in serum samples. Therefore, the DIG-1H3-based immunochromatographic
lateral-flow strip test developed here provides a rapid and convenient
method for detecting the concentration of DIG in plasma, and should
improve the rational use of this drug.

4.2 Solutions
The coating buffer contained
50 mM carbonate bicarbonate (CB, pH 9.6). The blocking buffer consisted
of 0.2% gelatin in CB. The assay buffer was PBS (0.01 M phosphate,
pH 7.4), and the washing buffer was prepared by 0.05% Tween 20 in
0.01 M PBS. The color buffer contained solution A (9.33 g of citric
acid, 36.8 g of Na2HPO4, and 180 μL of
30% H2O2 per 1000 mL) and solution B [0.06%
(v/v) 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in ethylene glycol]
mixed in a 5:1 (v/v) ratio. Human plasma was obtained from the Second
People’s Hospital of Wuxi City (Wuxi, China).

4.3 Preparation and Characterization of Antigens
The hapten
DIG was coupled to BSA or chicken OVA by sodium periodate oxidation,
briefly as follows: 219 mg of DIG (0.28 mol) was added dropwise to
10 mL of absolute ethanol; 10 mL of 0.1 mol L–1 NaIO4 solution was mixed and stirred at room temperature for 1
h. Ethylene glycol (1 mol L–1, 0.6 mL) was spiked
and the solution was stirred continuously for 5 min. The reaction
mixture was then added dropwise to a 2.8% (2.8 g/100 mL) BSA solution
(pH 9.0–9.5, adjusted with 5% K2CO3)
with stirring, and stirring was continued for 1 h until the pH had
stabilized. NaBH4 (150 mg) was added to deoxygenize for
16 h. Formic acid (1 mol L–1) was then added, the
pH was adjusted to 6.5, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature
for 1 h. The reaction mixture was dialyzed in water overnight (pH
8.5, adjusted with 5% NH4OH). The pH of the dialysate was
then adjusted to 4.8–5.1 with 0.1 mol L–1 HCl to maximize precipitation. The precipitate was allowed to stand
at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C for 3 h. The precipitate
was centrifuged at 4 °C for 8 min (1.2 × 104g) and the supernatant was abandoned. The sediment was dissolved
in 0.15 mol L–1 NaHCO3, and the solution
was collected in a dialysis bag for further separation and purification.
The coating antigen was prepared with the same method, except that
the carrier protein BSA was replaced with OVA. The structures of the
antigen synthesized in this study are shown in Figure 1. The antigens were characterized with electrophoresis.

4.4 Characterization Anti-DIG mAb
The DIG–BSA
complex described above was used as the immunogen and the method of
immunization was as previously reported.27 Briefly, female BALB/c mice (8–10 weeks old) were injected
with the immunogen (DIG–BSA) to produce polyclonal antibodies
against DIG. After the third immunization, the sera were collected
from the mice and examined with ic-ELISA. The procedure was described
briefly as follows:28 the coating antigen
(DIG–OVA) was diluted to 0.3, 0.1, 0.03 μg/mL and was
encapsulated in a 96-well plate with a coating solution and a blocking
solution. Standard potassium PBS (K+PBS; 50 μL/well)
was then added, together with diluted mouse serum, and the plate was
transferred to 37 °C incubator for 30 min. Then HRP-labeled goat
anti-mouse IgG antibody was added to each well and the plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Color buffer (100 μL) was
added to each well and incubated for 30 min in the dark, after which
50 μL of pure sulfuric acid (2 M) was added to terminate the
reaction. The absorbance of each well at 450 nm was measured with
a microplate reader. After the fifth immunization with the immunogen,
the mouse with the highest serum antibody titer and lowest IC50 were selected for cell fusion. The hybridomas were screened
with an ic-ELISA and selected with the limiting dilution method. The
ascites were purified by octanoic acid–ammonium sulfate precipitation
to isolate the mAbs, dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 3 days.
All animal studies in this work were performed according to institutional
ethical guidelines and were approved by the Committee on Animal Welfare
of Jiangnan University.

Digitoxin, cortisol, estradiol, dexamethasone,
testosterone, progesterone, estrone, and ouabain were tested with
the ic-ELISA. The CR values were calculated with the following equation29  

4.5 Preparation of the Immunochromatographic
Strip
Gold nanoparticles were prepared with a previously
reported method.30 First, 100 mL of chloroauric
acid solution (HAuCl4, 0.01%, w/v) was heated in an Erlenmeyer
flask and stirred vigorously to the boiling point. Then, 5 mL of freshly
prepared 1% (w/v) trisodium citrate solution was immediately added
while stirring until the solution was burgundy. The solution was boiled
15 min and cooled to room temperature and stored at 4 °C until
use. Gold nanoparticles have an average diameter of 17 ± 2 nm,
and transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize gold
nanoparticles.

The mAb solution (1 mg/mL) was spiked to 20 mL
colloidal gold solution and the pH was adjusted 8.2 with 0.1 M K2CO3. The surfaces of the untreated gold particles
were blocked with BSA (10%, 100 mL) at room temperature for 2 h. After
centrifugation at 8000g for 30 min at 4 °C,
the precipitate was resuspended in 0.1 mL ultrapure water and stored
at 4 °C until use.31

4.6 Analysis of Blood Samples with Immunochromatographic Strip
The immunochromatographic test strip is established on a specific
antigen–antibody reaction. The antibody with a positive point
is electrostatically adsorbed onto the gold nanoparticles with negative
sites to form a gold-labeled mAb for detecting a specific substance.
The immunochromatographic strip consisted of five sections: a sample
pad, a PVC backing card, a conjugate pad (glass fiber), an absorbent
pad, and a NC membrane. The top of the PVC backing plate is fixed
with an absorbent pad, an NC film is attached to the middle, and a
conjugation pad and a sample pad are pasted to the bottom. Goat anti-mouse
IgG antibody and an optimum concentration of coating antigen were
sprayed onto the NC membrane, forming a test line (T line) and control
line (C line). Finally, the pad was cut longitudinally into 3 mm strips.

Human plasma samples (5 mL) were centrifuged for 5 min at 16 000g. The supernatant was diluted 10 times, transferred to
another centrifuge tube, and examined immediately. The liquid sample
was mixed into the sample pad and immediately moved to the absorbent
pad, and the consequence was detected visually after 5 min. In positive
samples, DIG competed with the antigen for the gold-labeled mAb on
the T line. Conversely, if the sample solution contained no DIG, the
gold-labeled anti-DIG mAb was captured by the antigen immobilized
on the T line, causing the T line to become colored. The C line always
showed obvious color because the free gold-labeled mAb or mAb conjugate
was captured by the anti-mouse IgG antibody.32 Therefore, as the DIG in the sample increased, the color of the
T line decreased. When the amount of DIG reached a certain concentration,
it reacted with all the gold-labeled anti-DIG mAb and the T line disappeared.
