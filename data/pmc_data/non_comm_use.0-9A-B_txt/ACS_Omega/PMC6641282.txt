The current work reports ionic liquid
(IL) facilitated dehydrogenation
of tert-butylamine borane (TBAB) at 90 and 105 °C.
For the screening of potential IL solvent, solubility predictions
of TBAB in ILs were performed by the conductor-like screening model
segment activity coefficient (COSMO-SAC) model. The COSMO-SAC model
predicted a logarithmic infinite dilution activity coefficient of
−6.66 and −7.31 for TBAB in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
acetate [BMIM][OAc] and trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinate
[TDTHP][Phosph], respectively. Hydrogen (1.95 equiv) was seen to release
from TBAB/[BMIM][OAc] at 105 °C, whereas TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph]
produced 1.63 equiv of hydrogen after 360 min of dehydrogenation.
The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) characterization
of TBAB/IL systems revealed the structural integrity of ILs during
dehydrogenation. Further characterization through the boron NMR (11B NMR) technique disclosed the time-resolved formation and
stability of the starting compound, intermediate boron moieties, and
product distribution. The 11B NMR characterization also
revealed the fact that the TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] mixture dehydrogenates
via bimolecular addition of TBAB by forming borohydride anion (−BH4–). It was seen to oligomerize with the
subsequent addition of TBAB in the oligomer chain. For the TBAB/[BMIM][OAc]
system, the 11B NMR characterization could not identify
the borohydride anion but confirmed a faster formation of the B=N
moiety when compared to the TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] system. On the basis
of the NMR characterization, IL-facilitated dehydrogenation mechanism
of TBAB is proposed.

1 Introduction
Amine
boranes are primarily composed of boron and nitrogen with
the presence of at least one B–N bond. They are considered
potential candidates for chemical hydrogen storage. Apart from the
hydrogen storage application, amine boranes are used as mild and moderate
alkaline reducing agents.1 High gravimetric
density for hydrogen makes several amine boranes an intense topic
for research for developing on-board hydrogen storage materials.2 Ammonia borane (AB) is the simplest compound
in the amine borane family having a gravimetric storage capacity of
19.6 wt %. Substituted amine boranes have lesser content of hydrogens
but are still considered for chemical storage of hydrogens. The Lewis
acid–base adducts are also particularly useful for chemical
reagents and precursors.3

tert-Butylamine borane (TBAB) is a substituted
amine borane having ∼6 wt % gravimetric storage. It has some
distinct applications such as a reducing agent for the restoration
of art work.4 Metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation
is the most prominent route for dehydrogenation of TBAB. Bellham et
al.5 reported the catalytic dehydrogenation
of TBAB with β-diketiminate-supported silylamido calcium complex.
Catalytic dehydrocoupling of TBAB undergoes β-hydride elimination
from amionoborane [t-BuNH=BH2].
Additionally, diamidoborane [HB(NH-t-Bu)2], diborazane [(t-BuHN–BH2)2], and triborazine species [(t-BuN–BH)3] are identified as reaction intermediates and products. The
reaction kinetics is found to be slow, and appearance of triborazine
is observed at 60 °C after 138 h of heating. Triamido-amine-supported
zirconium complex facilitates dehydrocoupling of TBAB forms, triborazine,
polyborazylene, and aminodiborane, at longer reaction times.6 García-Vivó et al.7 reported the thermal dehydrogenation of TBAB facilitated
by group 6 cyclopentadienyl complexes having single and triple metal–metal
bonds {e.g., [Cr2Cp2(CO)6] and [Mo2Cp2(μ-dppm)(CO)2]; Cp = cyclopentadienyl,
dppm = 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino) methane} at 60 °C. After 12
h of reaction, triborazine and cycloborazane products are formed.
Hansmann et al.8 measured the dehydrogenation
of TBAB with AlIII and GaIII bases Al(NiPr2)3 and E(NMe2)3 (E = Al, Ga) to produce triborazine. N-heterocyclic
carbene IPr {IPr = [(HCNDipp)C:]; Dipp = 2,6-iPr2C6H3} facilitated TBAB
dehydrogenation in the metal-free condition, resulting in the formation
of similar compounds.9

Looking at
the advantages, we have explored the dehydrogenation
of TBAB facilitated by ionic liquids (ILs). The use of ILs in amine
borane dehydrogenation arises from the theory that it is known for
lowering the induction period and dehydrogenation temperature and
producing uniform product distribution.10 Further it is a known fact that the polar nature of ILs coupled
with tunable physio-chemical properties, wide liquidus temperature,
and negligible vapor pressure favor ILs for use as separation media,11 catalysis,12 and
organic and inorganic syntheses.13

Imidazolium class of ILs form self-organization assembly in solid,
liquid, and gaseous phases. The cations and anions are bonded through
extended scale of hydrogen bonds (H-bond) and hence are highly ordered.
The imidazolium-based ILs form H-bonds with protic and hydridic moieties
of AB and effectively break the dihydrogen bond network. Thus, it
reduces the activation energy barrier, and H2 is released
without the induction period. In the presence of relatively weak bases
or electron-rich transition metal complexes, the imidazolium cation
forms carbene, which stabilizes the transient species in the reactions.
Himmelberger et al.14 reported a mechanistic
investigation of AB/imidazolium IL systems. Sahler et al.15 also reported the use of imidazolium IL, which
lowers the activation energy and enhances the yield of hydrogen for
the dehydrogenation of ethylene diamine bisborane (EDAB). Banerjee
et al.16 recently reported a 3.96 equiv
yield of H2 at 105 °C from EDAB using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
acetate ([BMIM][OAc]) IL. In combination with basic anions, imidazolium
cations exert a strong effect on the yield of hydrogen. The nature
of anions particularly is known to control the reaction rate.

Phosphonium-based ILs are another class of ILs, which are more
thermally stable than their ammonium or imidazolium counterpart. Further,
a change in the cationic center from nitrogen to phosphorous leads
to superior physio-chemical properties.17 However, the dehydrogenation studies of amine boranes with phosphonium-based
ILs are relatively scarce. Our previous investigation with phosphonium
IL-facilitated dehydrogenation of EDAB suggests that the intermediate
radicals are more stable in the basic environment of phosphonium ILs,
despite lower yield of H2, than in imidazolium-based ILs.18 Because of the lower density than water, the
phosphonium-based ILs are particularly useful for separation of biobutanol,19 rare earth, and noble metals20 from aqueous streams. Further, they are suitable for the
application of super capacitors because of an enhanced electrochemical
window.21 Bradaric et al.22 reported the industrial scale preparation of a series of
phosphonium-based ILs from the phosphonium salt.

Following the
above discussion, we have selected [BMIM][OAc] and
trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinate
([TDTHP][Phosph]) for the dehydrogenation of TBAB. The ILs are chosen
based on our apriori prediction of infinite dilution activity coefficient
(IDAC) by the conductor like screening model segment activity coefficient
(COSMO-SAC)23 model. We employ nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization to characterize the TBAB/IL
systems. 1H NMR characterization reveals the role of ILs
in the dehydrogenation, and 11B NMR characterization reveals
the formation and stability of intermediates and products. Therefore,
based on our 11B NMR characterization, we propose an IL-facilitated
reaction mechanism for the dehydrogenation of TBAB.

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Screening of ILs
Solubility of TBAB
in IL is the primary criteria for selecting an IL. Further, we avoid
the ILs, which have the potential to form acids at higher temperature.
Thus, halogen-based ILs are not considered as they form acid upon
heating. We have considered 75 pairs of cation–anion combinations
within the imidazolium and phosphonium class of ILs. On the basis
of the value of IDAC or capacity, the ILs are grouped as high solubility
(i.e., capacity ≥ 102) and low solubility (1 ≤
capacity ≤ 102). The capacity is defined as the
inverse of IDAC and therefore is a unitless quantity. The frequency
diagrams are plotted in Figure 1. For imidazolium-based ILs, 2 acetate-, 1 aminoacetate-,
1 aminopropionate-, and 2 tetrachloroaluminate-based ILs have qualified
for a high solubility of ∼102. Among them, TBAB
has the highest solubility in [BMIM][OAc] with a calculated logarithmic
IDAC value of −6.66. Similarly, among the phosphonium-based
ILs, TBAB is more soluble in [TDTHP][Phosph] than in phosphonium-decanoate
IL. This is exactly the reason that these two ILs are chosen for the
dehydrogenation experiment of TBAB. TBAB is not soluble in imide-based
ILs, hence no value is recorded for them in Figure 1.

times the anion has a capacity ≥102. The hatched
gray bars represent the number of times the anion has a capacity between
1 and 100. (i) Imidazolium-based ILs and (ii) phosphonium-based ILs.

2.2 Dehydrogenation
Experiments
Figure 2 represents the time-resolved
equivalent hydrogen production of TBAB/IL systems. To ensure repeatability,
a set of three experiments were performed at all temperatures. Therefore,
the error bars in Figure 2 represent the standard deviation of equivalent hydrogen generation
at a certain temperature and at a particular time. Although TBAB has
14 hydrogen atoms (9 from −CH3 moieties, 2 from
−NH2 moieties, and 3 from −BH3 moieties), only 5 hydrogens are available for release as the breaking
of C–H bond is a high enthalpy reaction. Therefore, the calculated
“equivalent hydrogen” refers to the total hydrogen released
per mole of TBAB fed to the system. After 360 min, the cumulative
amount of equivalent hydrogen release for the TBAB/[BMIM][OAc] system
is 1.89 and 1.95 at 90 and 105 °C, respectively. On similar lines,
TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] gives a release of 1.56 and 1.63 equiv of hydrogen
at 90 and 105 °C, respectively. It is evident that imidazolium
IL facilitates a faster and higher amount of hydrogen release, in
line with the similar trend for IL-assisted dehydrogenation of EDAB.16,18 Upon heating, the TBAB/[BMIM][OAc] system instantly releases hydrogen.
A single equivalent of hydrogen is seen to release within 30 min of
dehydrogenation, and after 180 min, the release becomes negligible.
Initially, the rate of release is similar in both the temperatures,
however with prolonged heating, the rate of release becomes faster
at 105 °C, and hence more hydrogen is generated. For the TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph]
system, hydrogen starts to evolve after 10 min with a slower rate,
where a single equivalent of hydrogen is released after 90 min. A
higher rate of release is observed between 40 and 120 min, whereas
a lower rate of release is observed after 120 min. Thus, after 360
min, we obtain 1.95 equiv of hydrogen release from the TBAB/[BMIM][OAc]
system. The dehydrogenation of pure TBAB at 105 °C yields only
0.77 equiv of hydrogen after 360 min. The rate of release is even
slower than IL-facilitated dehydrogenation. The ionic nature of cations
and anions of IL hence indeed influences the mobility of TBAB and
its intermediates to form new boron moieties, thereby initiating a
higher amount of H2 release than dehydrogenation of pure
TBAB.

and TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] at 90 and 105 °C. Equivalent hydrogen
generation from pure TBAB at 105 °C is also provided.

2.3 1H NMR Characterization
Figure 3 represents
the 1H NMR spectra of pure ILs, TBAB, and IL/TBAB systems.
In each spectra, the area under the resonance would reflect the number
of hydrogens of the functional group. At first, a reference chemical
shift is identified, and the area is assigned to unity, which corresponds
to one hydrogen. With reference to this area, other areas are integrated,
and thus the number of hydrogens belonging to a particular functional
group is identified. Further, we have also considered the shielding
effect of nuclei in assigning a moiety. 1H NMR spectra
of pure [BMIM][OAc] is given in Figure 3i. The chemical shifts at δ = 10.18, 7.96, and
7.88 ppm are assigned as hydrogens belonging to the imidazolium ring
(denoted by “a”). Chemical shift at δ = 3.89 ppm
is assigned to the methyl moiety (−CH3) (denoted
by “b”). The chemical shifts of the butyl chain are
δ = 4.20 (t), 1.73 (m), 1.21 (m), and 0.84 (m) (denoted by “c”).
The singlet resonance at 1.59 ppm is assigned to the −CH3 moiety of the acetate anion (denoted by “d”). 1H NMR spectra of pure [TDTHP][Phosph] is given in Figure 3ii. The terminal
−CH3 moiety of both cation and anion appears at
δ = 0.86 ppm (denoted by “j”). Chemical shifts
at δ = 1.08–1.44 and 2.44 ppm (denoted by “h”)
are assigned to the −CH2 moiety of IL. Figure 3iii represents the 1H NMR spectra of pure TBAB. Chemical shift at δ = 5.07
ppm is assigned to −NH2 of TBAB because of the presence
of electronegative nitrogen. The methyl moiety is assigned at δ
= 1.10 ppm. The −BH3 moiety appeared as a flat peak
at δ = 1–1.4 ppm.

the quintet chemical shift of −BH4– is shown after extending the x-axis to −1.

Figure 3iv and 3v represent
the 1H NMR of TBAB/IL systems
prior and after reactions. For the TBAB/[BMIM][OAc] system (Figure 3iv), we observe a
mild upfield shift of resonances of IL. The chemical shift at δ
= 5.28 ppm (denoted by “e”) is assigned to −NH2 of TBAB because of the presence of electronegative nitrogen.
The tertiary butyl moiety (sp3) is located at δ =
1.06 ppm (denoted by “f”). The resonance for −BH3 of TBAB is merged with IL and hence is not prominent. However,
after the dehydrogenation, we do not observe the resonances for the
protic moiety, but resonances for [BMIM][OAc] remain unaltered. A
small resonance for the tertiary butyl moiety of TBAB is also visible. Figure 3v represents the 1H NMR of TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] system before and after the
reaction. Here we observe a mild downfield shift of resonances of
IL. Further, the chemical shift at δ = 4.07 ppm represents the
protic (−NH2) moiety of TBAB (denoted by “g”).
The basic environment of IL causes an upfield shift of −NH2. The −CH3 and −BH3 moieties
of TBAB are merged with the resonances of IL. After 360 min of dehydrogenation,
the chemical shifts of IL remain unchanged, whereas at the same time,
the resonance for the protic moiety is not observed. We observe quintet
resonance at δ = −0.22 to 0.18 ppm, which denotes the
presence of −BH4– after 360 min
of reaction. The presence of quintet resonance after 360 min suggests
that the dehydrogenation of TBAB in [TDTHP][Phosph] IL is not completed,
whereas no such resonance is observed for the TBAB/[BMIM][OAc] system
(Figure 3iv). Therefore,
we conclude a catalytic role of IL from the 1H NMR characterization
along with faster dehydrogenation provided more by [BMIM][OAc] when
compared to [TDTHP][Phosph] IL.

2.4 11B NMR Characterization
Before assigning the 11B resonances of the moieties of
TBAB/IL systems during dehydrogenation, we take a closer look of assigned 11B NMR characterization from the literature. The prominent
route for dehydrogenation of TBAB remains transition metal catalyst-facilitated
dehydrogenation.5−9 The dehydrogenation, as described by Bellham et al.,5 follows the β-hydride elimination from TBAB to form
aminoborane [t-BuNH=BH2] having
a chemical shift at δ = 38.2 ppm. Additionally, several new
born intermediates are reported, such as diamidoborane [HB(NH-t-Bu)2] at δ = 29.1 ppm (doublet) and diborazane
[(t-BuHN–BH2)2] at δ
= −6.1 ppm (triplet). At δ = −30.1 ppm, −BH4–-containing species are also reported but
coordinated with calcium. They further reported an unidentified triplet
of doublets at δ = −22.8 ppm. However, on further heating,
cyclic borazine [(t-BuN–BH)3] is
identified at a broad singlet resonance at δ = 34.4 ppm along
with diamidoborane and diborazane. However, they observe the disappearance
of −BH4– at a longer duration.
On the other hand, Erickson et al.24 reported
the unsaturated aminoborane as the final product using tin catalysts.
This is rather inconsistent with other metal catalyst-supported dehydrogenations
of TBAB. Sabourin et al.9 reported metal-free
dehydrogenation of TBAB, facilitated by N-heterocyclic carbene IPr
{IPr = [(HCNDipp)C:]; Dipp = 2,6-iPr2C6H3}. The N-heterocyclic carbene IPr-facilitated
dehydrogenation of TBAB yields monomeric aminoborane at δ =
35.2 ppm (triplet) and triborazine at δ = 25.9 ppm (doublet).
At δ = −17.9 ppm, IPr·BH2N(t-Bu)H–BH3 is reported, which has −BH2 and −BH3 resonances together. Additionally,
(t-BuNH)B2H5 at δ = −25.8
ppm, an unknown species at δ = −8.3 ppm (broad singlet),
and −BH4– (quintet) resonance
at δ = −36.4 ppm are reported. The notable observation
in the reported literature is that, metal-free dehydrogenation influences
the upfield shift of boron moieties. Therefore, the appearance of
resonance spectra of a particular moiety depends on the environment
of dehydrogenation. Further, in metal-free dehydrogenation, unsaturated
aminoborane is considered as the prime intermediate, which converts
to cyclic triborazine upon prolonged heating. The IL-facilitated dehydrogenation
of TBAB somewhat resembles the metal-free N-heterocyclic carbene IPr-facilitated
dehydrogenation.

With this brief background of reported results,
we assign the 11B NMR resonances of TBAB/IL systems at
105 °C in Figure 4. However, previously reported IL-facilitated dehydrogenation of
AB and EDAB are also taken into consideration while assigning the
resonances. Figure S1 of the Supporting Information represents the 11B NMR spectra of the TBAB/IL system
after 1 min of reaction at 90 and 105 °C. In Figure 4i, the chemical shift at δ
= −23.49 ppm (denoted by “a1”) is assigned to
the −BH3 moiety of TBAB in the TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph]
system. A quintet chemical shift at δ = −39.53 ppm (denoted
as “b1”) is observed after 20 min of heating (Figure 4i). The resonance
is attributed to –BH4– formation.
The formation of borohydride anion here reflects similarity in the
dehydrogenation pathway between AB and TBAB. The presence of −BH4– resonance after 360 min of dehydrogenation
suggests the stability of −BH4– in the basic environment of [TDTHP][Phosph] and confirms that the
reaction does not go to completion even at 360 min. However, it takes
less time when compared to several metal catalyst-facilitated dehydrogenations.5,6 However, for diammoniate diborane (DADB), which is formed during
the dehydrogenation of AB, Stowe et al.25 identifies the −BH2 resonance at δ = −13
ppm. Similarly, Neiner et al.26 observed
the −BH2 resonance at δ = −10 ppm that
originates from the bimolecular EDAB resulting from the thermal dehydrogenation
of pure EDAB. Therefore, in line with the similar dehydrogenation
pathway, we observe a broad resonance at δ = −12 ppm
(denoted by “c1”) at t = 60 min that
refers to −BH2 of bimolecular TBAB [(H2C)3C–NH2–BH2–NH2–C(CH3)3]+[−BH4–]. However, a quartet resonance (denoted
by “d1”) at δ = −18.34 ppm is observed
after 60 min of heating. The “d1” grows stronger at
120 min and later diminishes. Concomitantly, the intensity of “a1”
also decreases. The quartet resonance formation is referred to the
new phase of TBAB, where the −BH3 moiety remains
in an environment different from that of the starting material. The
presence of a new −BH3 environment for AB is mentioned
in the literature.25 The above phenomena
support our volumetric hydrogen measurement in Figure 2, where we observe the accelerated rate of
release from the TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] system within 20–120
min. The sustained presence of “b1” and “c1”
implies the subsequent addition of TBAB in bimolecular TBAB species
and further release of hydrogen. Thus, more TBAB is seen to convert
into this anion and is subsequently added to form the TBAB oligomer.

Figure 4 Time-resolved 11B NMR at T = 105 °C.
(i) TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] and (ii) TBAB/[BMIM][OAc].

A flat low intensity resonance at δ = 20.22
ppm (denoted
by “e1”) appears after 180 min of dehydrogenation. The
discussion on analogues chemical shift corresponding to the unsaturated
B=N moiety will be helpful in assigning the resonance. The
solid-state dehydrogenation of AB produces borazine, polyborazylene,
and so forth having the B=N moiety. The solid-state 11B NMR spectra of the AB/[BMIM][Cl] ([BMIM][Cl]: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride) system produces a broad downfield resonance near 30 ppm,14 which is characteristic of the unsaturated sp2 boron–nitrogen framework, that is, polyborazylene
or borazine. However, the solution 11B NMR reported unsaturated
resonances around 16 ppm. Further, the authors explain the interactions
among unsaturated species, which state that the IL solvent could have
an upfield shift in spectra and speculate about the probe temperature
of the 11B NMR analysis leading to the shift in the resonances.
The observed B=N spectrum at δ = 16 ppm is changed to
δ = ∼30 ppm after heating the NMR probe from 27 to 100
°C.14 As per reported literature,
there are two species of dehydrogenated TBAB, which contains the B=N
moiety.5,9 Aminoborane has a chemical shift downfield
at δ = 35 ppm. Triborazine containing B=N possesses a
chemical shift at δ = 34.4 ppm, which is typical for metal catalyst-facilitated
dehydrogenation. A similar observation can also be found at δ
= 25.9 ppm for metal-free N-heterocyclic carbene IPr-facilitated dehydrogenation.9 Considering the above discussion reported in
the literature, it is evident that the chemical shift B=N can
be shifted depending upon the environment of the experiment and NMR
analysis. For that, we assign the singlet resonance at δ = 20.22
ppm (denoted by “e1”) as the B=N moiety.

Figure 4ii represents
the time-resolved 11B NMR characterization of the TBAB/[BMIM][OAc]
system. For TBAB/[BMIM][OAc], a marginal downfield shift is observed
at δ = −24.13 ppm for the −BH3 moiety.
The acidic medium, provided by the imidazolium-based ILs, promotes
the faster formation of B=N moieties at δ = 20.65 ppm
(denoted by “e1”). On the contrary, the presence of
intermediates is not observed in [BMIM][OAc] IL. Thus, the acidic
imidazolium cation in combination with the basic acetate anion accelerates
the yield of hydrogen but with a poor control in the reaction kinetics.
On the other hand, [TDTHP][Phosph] gives a wider control in the reaction
kinetics and stabilizes the ionic intermediates. In both 11B NMR spectra, we observe a broad resonance at ∼0 ppm, which
corresponds to the borosilicate NMR tube that we have used for characterization.
A small resonance around δ = 0.5–1.5 ppm is observed
in Figure 4i,ii. We
are unable to assign a relevant reference peak of this resonance despite
a thorough literature search. Hence, we have left it as an “unassigned
chemical shift.” However, we believe that the resonance can
be one of the intermediates and hence will enable to understand the
reaction mechanism of IL-facilitated dehydrogenation of TBAB. In both 11B NMR spectra, we observe a broad resonance at ∼0
ppm, which corresponds to the borosilicate NMR tube that we have used
for characterization.

2.5 Proposed Mechanism of Dehydrogenation
of TBAB/IL
Systems
Most amine boranes such as AB and EDAB dehydrogenate
through the bimolecular addition, which reduces the activation energy
barrier. The dehydrogenation of pure AB goes through induction, nucleation,
and growth phases.25 The induction phase
refers to the breaking of the dihydrogen bond network and formation
of mobile AB. Nucleation refers to the formation of bimolecular DADB.
The appearance of DADB is identified by the −BH4– resonance at around δ = −36 to −40
ppm. The release of hydrogen commences after the formation of DADB.
The growth phase is the subsequent addition of AB into DADB to form
polyaminoborane (PAB). During the formation of PAB, addition of AB
generates the −BH4– anion, there
is reorientation of −BH4– into
the main chain of the oligomer, and hydrogen is released. Unsaturated
oligomers (polyiminoborane, borazylene, etc.) are formed over prolonged
heating that lead to the release of second equivalent hydrogen. According
to the AB/IL dehydrogenation stated by Himmelberger et al., PAB has
a broadened structure that extends from δ = −7 to −25
ppm.14 The dehydrogenation mechanism of
EDAB was proposed in similar lines with the formation of bimolecular
EDAB as the primary intermediate,26,27 and hydrogen
is released over subsequent addition of EDAB in the oligomer ring
chain. Here also, the second equivalent hydrogen is released after
the formation of a five-member ring from each EDAB monomer.

On the basis of our 11B NMR characterization, we propose
a reaction mechanism scheme of TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] as per Figure 5, which is in line
with IL-facilitated dehydrogenation of AB and EDAB. The presence of
borohydride anions throughout the dehydrogenation period and the absence
of resonance beyond 30 ppm lead us to propose a different pathway
for TBAB/IL dehydrogenation, which is different for the TBAB/metal-catalyzed
dehydrogenation scheme, as given in the literature5,8 or
metal-free N-heterocyclic carbene IPr-facilitated dehydrogenation.9 It should be noted that from 1H NMR,
the structure of IL remains unaltered after the dehydrogenation; hence,
the scheme only considers the intermediate and product formation of
TBAB alone. TBAB has absence of the dihydrogen bond network because
of its lack of terminal amine (−NH2) moiety. Therefore,
we refer to the 20 min induction period for TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] because
of the high viscosity of IL. The measured viscosity of ILs and TBAB/IL
systems at 25, 90, and 105 °C are reported in Table 1. With the addition of TBAB
in IL, the viscosity of systems increases. However with the increase
of temperature, the viscosity of ILs and systems decreases. At 25
°C, TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] has a ∼6-fold higher viscosity
than TBAB/[BMIM][OAc] and at 105 °C, it becomes ∼3-fold
higher. Therefore, the high viscosity hinders the motion of TBAB molecules
freely, which results in the delayed formation of −BH4–.

Figure 5 Proposed dehydrogenation pathway of TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph].

a For each measurement,
0.5 mL of
IL is taken, and for TBAB/IL systems, 15 mg of TBAB is mixed with
0.5 mL of of IL.

The scheme
starts with the bimolecular addition of two TBAB molecules
similar to the DADB formation in the nucleation phase of AB dehydrogenation
(step 5.1). The presence of “b1” implies that all TBAB
do not form bimolecular species instantly. This step is analogous
to the dehydrogenation of AB and refers to the nucleation phase where
the first equivalent of hydrogen is evolved (step 5.2). The subsequent
growth phase adds up TBAB molecule to the bimolecular TBAB through
the formation of −BH4– and −BH2 (step 5.3). The identification of B=N in 11B NMR spectra indicates the second hydrogen release from the TBAB
oligomer (step 5.4). However, we cannot conclusively say the formation
of triborazine as the end product, but certainly the presence of the
B=N moiety in the form of poly-TBAB.

3 Conclusions
We present the mechanistic insight of dehydrogenation
of TBAB in
[BMIM][OAc] and [TDTHP][Phosph] IL belonging to the imidazolium and
phosphonium classes of IL, respectively. Both the ILs are seen to
provide the acidic and basic environments, respectively, for dehydrogenation.
The dehydrogenation at 105 °C and 4 × 10–2 mbar gauge pressure yields 1.95 and 1.63 equiv of hydrogen from
TBAB/[BMIM][OAc] and TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph], respectively. The 1H NMR characterization reveals the structural integrity of
IL after dehydrogenation and establishes the role of IL as the liquid
catalyst. Further, time-resolved 11B NMR characterization
of aliquots elucidates the formation and stability of the starting
material, intermediates, and products. The 11B NMR characterization
reveals a stark difference in the stability of reaction intermediates,
thus emboldening the dominant role of the reaction environment provided
by ILs. TBAB/[TDTHP][Phosph] dehydrogenates via bimolecular addition
of TBAB by forming −BH4–. The
basic nature of [TDTHP][Phosph] stabilizes −BH4–, where the release of the first equivalent of hydrogen
is observed. Subsequent addition of TBAB leads to the formation of
the TBAB oligomer, which is seen to release the second equivalent
of hydrogen to form the B=N moiety as the final product of
dehydrogenation. The appearance of the B=N moiety is at a higher
rate for the TBAB/[BMIM][OAc] system. The intermediates are observed
to be unstable in this system, implying the fact that the acetate
anion accelerates the faster completion of the reaction.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Computational Method
Quantum chemical
coupled with statistical mechanical-based COSMO-SAC model is used
to screen the IL as the solvent for dehydrogenation of TBAB. The details
of the COSMO-SAC model are found elsewhere in the literature.28 Briefly, the COSMO files are first extracted
from quantum chemical calculation. The initial structures are drawn
by Gauss View 5.029 visualization packages,
followed by the geometry optimization by Gaussian 09 package.30 The geometry optimization is carried out by
density functional theory (DFT) with Becke’s three-parameter
exact exchange functional together with the gradient-corrected functions
of Lee, Young, and Parr abbreviated as B3LYP,31,32 with 6-311+G(d) as the basis set. COSMO files are generated with
another set of DFT calculations with the BVP8633 level of theory, with the coordinates of atoms from optimized
geometries. The density fitting basis set DGA134 along with SVP35 are used for
accuracy in relative energies and molecular structures. In the COSMO-SAC
theory, molecules are divided into surface segments, and the COSMO
file stores the information of coordinate of each segment along with
the surface area and screening charge density of each of them. We
have used our in-house reimplementation28 to extract the information from the COSMO file and to predict the
IDAC (denoted as γ∞) of TBAB in ILs. IDAC
is a preferred quantitative descriptor because it predicts the deviation
from the ideal behavior of a mixture. The logarithmic value of IDAC
is used to quantitatively measure the solubility of TBAB in IL. The
negative value of logarithmic IDAC {ln(γ∞)}
measures the solubility of TBAB in ILs, whereas the positive value
denotes insolubility. Further, we have segregated the ILs based on
the capacity of TBAB in ILs. Capacity is defined as the reciprocal
of IDAC. Higher release of hydrogen is achieved with the higher value
of capacity and thus better solubility.

4.2 Experimental
Method
TBAB (97% purity),
[BMIM][OAc] (≥95% purity), and [TDTHP][Phosph] (≥95%
purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The ILs were purified after
heating in an oil bath at 80 °C for 48 h in the presence of high
vacuum. Purity of ILs was confirmed by 1H NMR characterization.
TBAB (10 mg) and 0.5 mL of IL were taken in a three-necked round-bottom
reactor and connected with the experimental setup, as shown in Figure 6i. The setup is divided
into two distinct sections, namely, the reactor side (red dotted lines)
and the gas side (rest part). The reactor part consists of the three-necked
reactor and a filter valve. The gas side contains the condenser, collecting
flask gas chamber, gas burette, and mercury vessel mercury leveler.

Figure 6 Experimental
setup. (i) Schematic diagram of the experimental setup
for the dehydrogenation experiment. Reprinted (adapted)36 with permission from Copyright (2017) American
Chemical Society. (ii) Experimental setup for collecting aliquots.

The vacuum pump is connected with
the gas side (as shown) and with
one neck of the reactor (not shown). The dehydrogenation is performed
at 90 and 105 °C at a vacuum of 4 × 10–2 (±4% instrument error) mbar of gauge pressure. The high vacuum
is an integral part of the experiment as it minimizes the presence
of oxygen and moisture. Presence of these can influence the reaction
dynamics. Further, high vacuum also reduces the presence of nitrogen
gas as the cold trap is unable to condense nitrogen. During the heating
period, the valves VV, AV, filter valve, and collecting flask valve remain
close so that the system maintains vacuum. After a certain time of
heating, the filter valve is opened, allowing the evolved gases to
pass through the condenser. The liquid nitrogen is now used as a cold
trap. The cold trap condenses the volatile impurities and moisture
(if present), which are collected in the collecting flask. Hydrogen,
having a lower condensing temperature (−252 °C) than liquid
nitrogen, escapes the cold trap and enters into the gas chamber. The
valve AV allows the atmospheric air into the GC. The GC is a concentric
tube whose outer tube is connected to AV valve and inner tube is connected
to the condenser to collect the gases from cold trap. The atmospheric
air creates barometric pressure on mercury vessel (MV) and level of
mercury rises to GB. Finally, the volume of hydrogen is measured by
the displacement of mercury. After measuring the equivalent hydrogen,
the valve VV is opened up which remains closed during dehydrogenation
operation. It allows the mercury to come back in MV. The vacuum cycle
is again performed to remove the evolved gases. The evolved hydrogen
is collected from the top of the gas burette by using a Hamilton gas
syringe (5 mL, 22/2′/2). Thereafter, gas chromatography measurement
(Bruker, 450-GC, column Carboxen) is conducted to analyze the composition
of evolved gases after dehydrogenation. The gas chromatography analysis
performed by the thermal conductivity detector technique confirms
the purity of hydrogen in the collected gases from the gas burette.
The absence of peaks of other volatile gases in the analysis reflects
the efficient vacuum cycle and liquid nitrogen cold trap maintained
in the experimental setup.

However, the current experimental
setup makes it difficult to perform
a mechanistic investigation, as collection of aliquots can hamper
the vacuum cycle. Therefore, a separate experimental setup is designed
as per Figure 6ii.
TBAB (100 mg) and 5 mL of IL are taken in a three-necked round-bottom
flask kept in an oil bath maintained at a specified temperature. At
the start of the reaction, vacuum is created to minimize the influence
of oxygen and moisture. Later, the reactor is filled with nitrogen
to maintain an inert atmosphere. TBAB is found to dissolve in both
the ILs. During reaction, the mixture does not foam. Further, the
TBAB/IL mixture remains in faded yellowish color after the reaction.
However, during dehydrogenation, bubbles of gas coming out is visible
for a certain time period. Periodically, the evolved gases are pumped
out of the reactor. The samples are collected at various time intervals
for NMR characterization. 1H and 11B solution
NMR are recorded at room temperature on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer
( Bruker, AVANCE III HD, software Topspin 3.5).Because ILs are viscous
in nature, the molecular motion of TBAB will be hindered and may affect
the dehydrogenation kinetics. Hence, we have measured the viscosity
of ILs and TBAB/IL systems with an interfacial rheometer ( Anton Paar,
Physica MCR301), having a gap between rheometer geometry plates of
about 0.1 mm.
