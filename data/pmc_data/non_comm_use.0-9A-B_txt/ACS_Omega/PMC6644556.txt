Herein, nickel-catalyzed
decarbonylative C–F bond alkylation
of aroyl fluorides with organoboron reagents is reported. Aroyl fluorides
are more chemically stable than the corresponding aroyl chlorides
and can be readily synthesized from the corresponding carboxylic acids.
The fluoronickel intermediate formed via oxidative addition interacts
with Lewis-acidic trialkylboranes, and the subsequent decarbonylative
alkylation proceeds. This new synthetic methodology allows 1,2-bifunctionalization
of aromatic carboxylic acids via palladium-catalyzed ortho-C–H arylation. In addition, an unprecedented 1,4-nickel migration
on ortho-arylated aroyl fluorides was observed. As
a demonstration of the synthetic utility of the present reaction,
the sequential 1-alkyl-2-arylation of 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid was
accomplished via chemoselective alkylation at a fluorocarbonyl moiety
and the subsequent C–O bond arylation at an acetoxy group.

Introduction
In the past three decades,
palladium-catalyzed alkylation of aroyl
chlorides and anhydrides with organozinc,1 aluminum,2 tin,3 and lead compounds4 in a retentive manner
(i.e., where the reaction proceeds without decarbonylation) has been
utilized to afford unsymmetrical alkyl aryl ketones. In 2000, the
first palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura (S–M) alkylation
reaction of aroyl chlorides with alkylboranes was reported.5 Since then, transition-metal-catalyzed S–M
alkylation reaction has been widely applied as one of the most reliable
and versatile synthetic methods to construct C(sp2)–C(sp3) bonds.6 An example of the utility
of these reactions is found in the total synthesis of epothilones.7 In general, S–M alkylation requires a
special palladium complex bearing a sterically hindered bidentate
ligand because the target C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond formation should occur prior to a competing β-hydride
elimination.8

Decarbonylative cross-coupling
of carboxylic acid derivatives has
been developed as an alternative class of transition-metal-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions. Hence, development of S–M coupling
reaction of carboxylic acid derivatives with alkylboron reagents is
expected to be a new sustainable synthetic strategy of C–C
bond formation because naturally abundant carboxylic acid derivatives
could readily be synthesized and then be utilized as aryl electrophile
equivalents. In general, decarbonylative coupling reaction requires
relatively harsh conditions to overcome the high activation barrier
to decarbonylation. Malanga reported a Ni-catalyzed decarbonylative
reduction of aroyl chlorides with tin hydride into the corresponding
simple arenes,9 where decarbonylation of
a (aroyl)(chloro)nickel complex predominates above 50 °C. In
addition, previously reported density functional theory (DFT) studies
indicated that a relatively high activation barrier of 20–30
kcal/mol exists for decarbonylation.10

Recent development of decarbonylative cross-couplings of aromatic
carboxylic acid derivatives have been extensively reported. For example,
Yu and co-workers reported Rh(I)-catalyzed decarbonylative C–H
functionalization of aroyl chlorides.11 Sanford demonstrated widespread functionalizations via decarbonylative
chlorination of aroyl chlorides.12 In the
viewpoint of utilization of aromatic esters, Itami–Yamaguchi,
Love, and Rueping independently have demonstrated a practical Ni-
or Pd-catalyzed decarbonylative arylation of phenyl esters with organoboron
or zinc compounds through C(aroyl)–OPh bond cleavages and sequential
decarbonylation (Scheme 1a).13 On the other hand, regarding the
use of aroyl fluorides as substrates, there have been only one example,
which is a catalytic Negishi coupling in a retentive manner, affording
unsymmetrical alkyl aryl ketones, reported by Rovis (Scheme 1b),14 but no precedent decarbonylative transformation of aroyl fluorides
have been disclosed. Accordingly, we paid much attention to develop
an unprecedented decarbonylative alkylation of aroyl fluorides. Herein,
we report a first example of contrasting alkylation of aroyl fluorides
with Lewis-acidic alkylboranes. In previous studies on alkylation
in S–M coupling reaction, Lewis-acidic trialkylboranes have
been applied to accelerate transmetalation of alkyl groups via interaction
of oxygen in alkoxypalladium complexes with a boron center.8,15 We herein describe a novel C–F bond functionalization strategy
to construct alkyl–aryl scaffold starting from naturally abundant
carboxylic acid (Scheme 1c).

Scheme 1 Ni-Catalyzed Retentive vs Decarbonylative C–F Bond Functionalization
Results and Discussion
In an initial study, we optimized reaction conditions for the nickel-catalyzed
C(aroyl)–F bond ethylation of biphenyl-4-carbonyl fluoride
(1a) with BEt3 (2a, 1.0 equiv)
(Table 1). We first
elucidated the ligand effect (entries 1–5). To our delight,
the reaction with an air-stable and moderately electron-donating 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane
(DPPE) ligand selectively delivered the target decarbonylative cross-coupled
product 4-ethylbiphenyl (4aa), in 83% yield (entry 3).
Very recently, Rueping and co-workers have reported decarbonylative
coupling of aromatic ethers, and the related nickel/bidentate phosphine
catalysis could accelerate this decarbonylative coupling.13d,13e In contrast, results with a strong σ-donating N-heterocyclic carbene, ICy·HCl, ligand gave the retentive product
of 4-phenylacetophenone (3aa) in 27% yield (entry 5).
This result is notable because the reaction proceeds in a completely
retentive manner in spite of the fast oxidative addition obtained
with the strong σ-donating ICy·HCl ligand. We also optimized
reaction temperature; 4aa was obtained in 85% yield at
130 °C (entry 6), but in only 28% at 110 °C (entry 8). We
finally performed the reaction without any ligand, but no product
was formed (entry 9).

We then also examined the reaction with an array of
catalysts and
aromatic carboxylic acid derivatives (see Supporting Information). As a result, we identified that the current decarbonylative
alkylation was possible with the economical and air-stable Ni(OAc)2·4H2O precatalyst (80% NMR yield of 4aa at 130 °C), while NiCl2 showed no activity
(Table S4). Notably, alternative carboxylic
acid derivatives, such as aroyl chlorides, esters, and thioesters,
did not participate in the reaction (Table S5). These results clearly indicate that the nickel-catalyzed decarbonylative
alkylation is specific transformation for aroyl fluorides.

Our
investigations on the scope of aroyl fluorides substrates for
decarbonylative C(aroyl)–F bond ethylation are presented in Table 2. For this screen,
we employed a higher reaction temperature of 140 °C to obtain
better results. We established that products bearing electron-withdrawing
4-cyano (4ba, 68%), 4-methoxycarbonyl (4ca, 54%), 4-methylsulfonyl (4da, 51%), and electron-donating
4-butyl (4ea, 61%) and 4-butoxy (4fa, 52%)
groups were formed in moderate to good yields. Biphenyl-3-carbonyl
fluoride, in which phenyl group is installed in the meta-position, was also readily transformed to 3-ethylbiphenyl (4ga) as the target product in 71% yield. However, aroyl fluorides
bearing a substituent in the ortho-position, such
as biphenyl-2-carbonyl fluoride, gave lower yields (4ha, 36%). Decarbonylative ethylation of aroyl fluorides bearing multiple
substituents (4ia, 68% and 4ja, 69%) or
a fused ring (4ka–na; 56–78%)
at the meta- and para-positions
were also demonstrated. However, a substrate having a sterically hindered
mesityl group did not afford any corresponding product at all (4oa, <1%), as predicted by a previous DFT study.9 Finally, we evaluated heterocyclic substituents.
Benzo[b]thiophene-substituted aroyl fluoride afforded
a good yield of the target product 4pa in 70% yield.
However, benzo[b]furan-substituted aroyl fluoride
gave low yield (4qa, 28%). During this substrate screening
process, protonated products from β-hydride elimination were
also detected (4/β-hydride elimination >10:1).

Table 2 Scope of (Hetero)aroyl Fluorides for
Decarbonylative C((hetero)aroyl)–F Bond Alkylationa
a NMR yield based
on 1,4-dioxane as
an internal standard.

To
expand the scope of the reaction, we examined the reaction with
α-phenylcinnamoyl fluoride (1r), which proceeds
via C(alkenyl)–F bond cleavage. Under the same reaction conditions,
an E/Z mixture of products (4ra, 66% combined yield, E/Z = 0.93:1) was obtained. This result implies that decarbonylation
and E/Z isomerization sequences
are much faster than reductive elimination after the initial oxidative
addition (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 In the field of pharmaceuticals and natural product synthesis,
methylation is the most common alkylation. However, trimethylborane
is difficult to handle because it is a highly flammable gaseous substance
at room temperature (rt). We thus evaluated the other reaction with
alternative methyl-containing organoboranes (see Supporting Information, Table S3). Pleasingly, we show that use of trimethylboroxine
(2b) in the presence of an equimolar amount of CsF efficiently
afforded the target 4-methylbiphenyl (4ac), whereas excess
CsF retarded the reaction. Finally, by employing a 2-fold greater
amount of all of the reagents, we succeeded in obtaining 4ac in 49% yield (Scheme 3). Other methylating reagents such as SnMe4 and SiMe4 proved unsuitable for the present reaction.

Scheme 3 To apply this decarbonylative C–F bond alkylation,
we developed
a novel ortho-arylation/ipso-alkylation
sequences since aroyl fluorides can be directly synthesized from the
corresponding carboxylic acids. Several research groups have independently
reported the palladium-catalyzed ortho-C–H
bond arylation of carboxylic acids.16 We
thus combined the ortho-C–H arylation protocol
of carboxylic acid with the sequential fluorination17 and the present decarbonylative C–F bond alkylation
(Scheme 4). As the
first step, we synthesized 3-aryl-2-naphthoic acids (6a–d) in 45–62% yields under modified conditions
of Daugulis’ procedure.16b Next,
the corresponding aroyl fluorides (7a–d) were readily prepared by fluorination with nucleophilic fluorinating
reagent (Deoxo-Fluor) in 31–78% yields. Finally, we carried
out the nickel-catalyzed decarbonylative alkylation of the C–F
bond. Notably, we detected a mixture of the target 2-ethyl-3-arylnaphtalenes
(8a–d) and 2-(2-ethyl-4-substituted
phenyl)naphthalenes (8a′–d′). As the possible reaction mechanism for the formation of unexpected
regioisomers of 8a′–d′, we herein propose the unprecedented 1,4-nickel migration whose
analogous phenomena have been well known for palladium,18 rhodium,19 cobalt,20 iridium,19m,21 platinum,18j and ruthenium.22 Only one example of 1,4-nickel migration has been reported, albeit
in a bimetallic system.23 However, to the
best of our knowledge, a monometallic 1,4-nickel migration has not
been reported to date.

Scheme 4 ortho-Arylation, Fluorination,
and ipso-Alkylation Sequences, Starting from 2-Naphthoic
Acid (5)
As an additional application, we planned more straightforward
alkylation
and arylation sequences. Previously, Itami reported the orthogonal
couplings of different esters; decarbonylative coupling of phenyl
ester containing C(aroyl)–O bond cleavage predominantly occurred
prior to C(aryl)–O/C–H coupling.13a Hence, we next examined whether the present decarbonylative
coupling can proceed prior to C(aryl)–O bond cross-coupling
to realize a straightforward 1-alkyl-2-arylation. To investigate this
strategy, we conducted the nickel-catalyzed C(aryl)–O bond
arylation with triarylboroxines under the standard conditions reported
by Shi.24 On the basis of the synthetic
procedure, we started the chemoselective functionalization of the
substrate having both fluorocarbonyl and acetoxy groups with organoboron
under nickel catalysis (Scheme 5). 3-Acetoxy-2-(fluorocarbonyl)naphthalene (11) was readily synthesized in 62% overall yield through acid-catalyzed
acetoxylation of 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (9) and the
subsequent nucleophilic fluorination with Deoxo-Fluor. Subsequently,
we examined the nickel-catalyzed decarbonylative alkylation of 11. To our delight, the desired 3-acetoxy-2-ethylnaphthalene
(12) could be obtained in 51% yield without any C(aryl)–O
bond-cleaved byproduct. Finally, we conducted the nickel-catalyzed
arylation via C(aryl)–O bond cleavage and isolated 8a–d as the target products in 44–75% yield.
Through this synthetic scheme, we accomplished a straightforward 1-alkyl-2-arylation
sequence of a naturally abundant hydroxy carboxylic acid scaffold.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a new protocol for decarbonylative
C(aroyl)–F bond alkylation with Lewis-acidic organoboranes.
Lewis acidity of organoboranes is required due to the acceleration
of transmetalation in S–M reaction. Synthetically significant
methylation was also demonstrated by applying trimethylboroxine. A
thermodynamic driving force derived from B–F bond formation
provides a nexus for the specific transformation of aroyl fluorides
over aroyl halides. We are currently further investigating the mechanism
of this novel monometallic 1,4-nickel migration.

Experimental Section
General
All of the reactions were carried out under
Ar atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Glassware was dried
in an oven (150 °C) and heated under reduced pressure prior to
use. Solvents were employed as eluents for all other routine operations,
and dehydrated solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and
employed without any further purification. For thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) analyses throughout this work, Merck precoated TLC plates (silica
gel 60 GF254, 0.25 mm) were used. Silica gel column chromatography
was carried out using silica gel 60 N (spherical, neutral, 40–100
μm) from Kanto Chemicals Co., Ltd. The 1H, 11B{1H}, 13C{1H}, and 19F{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on Varian INOVA-600 (600
MHz) spectrometers. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR
Prestige-21 spectrophotometer. Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were
performed on a Shimadzu GC-14A equipped with a flame ionization detector
using Shimadzu Capillary Column (CBP1-M25-025) and Shimadzu C-R6A-Chromatopac
integrator. GC–mass spectrometry (MS) analyses were carried
out on a SHIMADZU GC-17A equipped with a Shimadzu QP-5050 GC–MS
system. Elemental analyses were carried out with a PerkinElmer 2400
CHN elemental analyzer at Okayama University. Compounds 1b,25,261c,271k,281l,27 and 1o,29 were prepared according to the reported literature methods.

Procedure for the Synthesis of Aroyl Fluorides
from Carboxylic Acids
To a 20 mL of Schlenk tube charged
with a magnetic stirrer bar, carboxylic acids 1-OH (3.0
mmol) and CH2Cl2 (15 mL) were successively added.
After the mixture was stirred at 0 °C, Deoxo-Fluor reagent (1.1
equiv, 608 μL, 3.3 mmol) was slowly added to the reaction mixture.
After the reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 30 min, the
solution was slowly poured into saturated NaHCO3, and after
CO2 evolution ceased, it was extracted into CH2Cl2 (3 × 15 mL) and dried over MgSO4.
The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (CH2Cl2 (1d), Hex/Et2O = 10:1 (others))

Synthesis
of 4-Ethylbiphenyl (4aa)30
To a 20 mL Schlenk tube, Ni(cod)2 (10
mol %, 3.4 mg, 0.0125 mmol), DPPE (10 mol %, 5.0 mg, 0.0125 mmol),
and toluene (500 μL) were added. After stirring for a short
time, BEt3 (2a) (1.0 M hexane solution, 125
μL, 0.125 mmol) and biphenyl-4-carbonyl fluoride (1a) (25.0 mg, 0.125 mmol) were added, and resulting mixture was heated
at 130 °C. After 24 h, the reaction was quenched with 1 M HCl
solution, extracted with EtOAc, washed by brine, and dried over MgSO4. After the volatiles were removed under vacuum, the crude
product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/Et2O = 10:1) to afford the desired product of 4-ethylbiphenyl (4aa) (17.7 mg, 0.0971 mmol) in 78% yield. 1H NMR

Acetylation of 3-Hydroxy-2-naphthoic
Acid (9):
Synthesis of 3-Acetoxy-2-naphthoic Acid (10)47
To a 50 mL Schlenk tube, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic
acid (9) (27 g, 143.5 mmol) and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) (40 mL) were added. Subsequently, a small amount of conc.
H2SO4 (20–30 drops) was added, and the
resulting mixture was vigorously stirred and heated at 90 °C.
After 30 min, the completion of reaction was checked by GC–MS,
subsequently quenched by water, extracted with CH2Cl2/acetone (∼10:1), washed by brine, and dried over MgSO4. After the volatiles were removed under vacuum, the crude
product was washed with hexane and collected 10 by filtration.
Isolated yield of the target 3-acetoxy-2-naphthoic acid (10) was 87% (28.8 g, 125.1 mmol). 1H NMR (acetone-d6, 600 MHz, rt): δ 2.30 (s, 3H), 7.59–7.62
