Recent
surveys have shown that the number of nanoparticle-based
formulations actually used at a clinical level is significantly lower
than that expected a decade ago. One reason for this is that the physicochemical
properties of nanoparticles fall short for handling the complexity
of biological environments and preventing nonspecific protein adsorption.
In this study, we address the issue of the interactions of plasma
proteins with polymer-coated surfaces. With this aim, we use a noncovalent
grafting-to method to functionalize iron oxide sub-10 nm nanoparticles
and iron oxide flat substrates and compare their protein responses.
The functionalized copolymers consist of alternating poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) chains and phosphonic acid grafted on the same backbone.
Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation was used to monitor polymer
adsorption kinetics and evaluate the resistance to protein adsorption.
On flat substrates, functionalized PEG copolymers adsorb and form
a brush in moderate or highly stretched regimes, with densities between
0.15 and 1.5 nm–2. PEG layers using phosphonic acid
as linkers exhibit excellent protein resistance. In contrast, layers
prepared with carboxylic acid as the grafting agent exhibit mitigated
protein responses and layer destructuration. The present study establishes
a correlation between the long-term stability of PEG-coated particles
in biofluids and the protein resistance of surfaces coated with the
same polymers.

I Introduction
In nanomedicine, the possibility of using engineered nanoparticles
for medical imaging and therapy has attracted much interest over the
last 15 years. Recent surveys have shown, however, that nanotechnology-based
formulations have not been as successful as initially thought.1 The number of nanoparticle carriers actually
used to improve patient outcomes at a clinical level is significantly
lower than that expected a decade ago. Today, most therapeutic drug-carrying
particles are in the form of liposomes, lipid-based complexes, or
biodegradable polymer/drug combinations. More complex nanoformulations,
including inorganic particles, have been barely exploited or are still
in clinical trials. One of the reasons for these mixed results is
related to the difficulty in matching the physicochemical properties
of nanoparticle carriers to the constraints of biological environments
and, in particular, in preventing ubiquitous nonspecific protein adsorption.
For a vast majority of nanoformulations, particles administered in
vivo are recognized by plasma proteins and eliminated from the blood
stream within a few minutes, leading to their accumulation in unrelated
organs, such as the liver and kidneys.2,3

On the
physicochemical side, it is now well established that for
biological applications nanoparticle surfaces need to be modified
to prevent protein adsorption. A great deal of surface functionalization
methods have been developed and assessed either in vitro or in vivo.
The most advanced strategies have been based on modified or grafted
polymers,4−11 although new fabrication techniques using supported bilayer or biomembrane
mimetics are currently being evaluated.12 In polymers, surface functionalization is achieved either by physical
adsorption methods (such as spin-coating, layer-by-layer assembly,
and solvent-casting)13,14 or chemical bonding methods based
on surface-initiated polymerization10,11 or surface
activation by means of radiation treatments.15−17 Surface functionalization
takes advantage of the extended library of polymer architectures (linear
chains, copolymers, stars, and dendrimers) and chelating agents that
were developed in polymer and coordination chemistry.18−24 Hydrosoluble neutral polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),
polyacrylamide, and some polysaccharides, show improved protein resistance
(as compared to that of ion-containing chains) and have been incorporated
into nanomedicine formulation synthesis. Among the polymers tested,
PEG is the most studied bioresistant polymer.3,21,23−33 Apart from being inexpensive and approved by regulatory and control
agencies, PEG offers many advantages. Made of a sequence of −CH2–CH2–O– monomers, PEG is a
flexible macromolecule and can be synthesized with a narrow molecular
weight dispersity. Moreover, PEG was also found to accurately follow
polymer dynamics predictions,34,35 so it allows quantitative
evaluation of the chain conformation, in view of the importance of
this factor in determining the adsorption protein behavior.

For polymers at curved or flat interfaces, chain conformations
may be strikingly different. Alexander and de Gennes were the first
to describe theoretically the conformational behavior of polymers
at interfaces and, specifically, polymers tethered by one extremity
and having the remaining part of the chain dangling in the solvent.36,37 For flat surfaces, two main regimes were predicted.37,38 At low polymer densities, that is, σ < 1/πRg2, where Rg is the gyration radius of
the chains under good solvent conditions, the polymers adopt a so-called
mushroom configuration. In this first case, the adlayer thickness
is twice the gyration radius. At higher densities, that is, σ
> 1/πRg2, monomer–monomer excluded volume interactions
induce stretching of the chains, which then enter the brush regime.
In this configuration, the height increases and varies as h ∼ σνN,
where N is the degree of polymerization and ν,
a coefficient between 1/3 and 1 that depends on solvent quality.38−40 It is commonly admitted that the soft interfaces represented by
hydrosoluble polymer brushes are excellent protein repellents.6,15,21,25,27,30,41−43 Polymer adlayers or brushes are
generally regarded as steric repulsive barriers. Recent studies have
shown, however, that protein interactions with soft interfaces are
far more complex and that the brushes act as kinetic barriers rather
than efficiently preventing adsorption.42

The present report aims at establishing a correlation between
the
stability of PEGylated particles in biological environments and the
protein resistance of PEGylated surfaces coated with the same polymers.
To this end, we used a noncovalent grafting-to method to deposit functionalized
PEG copolymers on iron oxide substrates under environmentally friendly
conditions, that is, in aqueous media and at room temperature. The
copolymers studied consist of alternating PEG chains (of molecular
weight 1000, 2000, and 5000 g mol–1) and acidic
moieties grafted on the same backbone. The deposition on iron oxide
is driven by the acid groups, which are of two kinds, carboxylic acid
and phosphonic acid. Phosphonic acid is known to have a higher affinity
toward metals or metal oxides compared to that of sulfates and carboxylates,
and it is anticipated that these residues will build stronger links
with the surface.21−23,32,41,44,45 This research follows up recent pharmacokinetics studies showing
that sub-10 nm iron oxide nanoparticles coated with the above polymers
circulate in the blood pool for over 2 h without being recognized
by the mononuclear phagocytic system.24 The circulation time was about 50 times higher than that of non-PEGylated
probes and benchmarks, a feature that was unequivocally attributed
to the coating. To study the interaction of PEGylated polymers and
proteins with iron oxide substrates, quartz crystal microbalance with
dissipation (QCM-D) was carried out with a twofold objective: (i)
to monitor the polymer adsorption kinetics and derive the adlayer
structure and (ii) to evaluate the protein resistance of the built-up
layers. By varying parameters such as the acid–base conditions,
polymer molecular weight, and nature of the grafting agent, different
protein resistance performances were obtained, with values ranging
typically from 65 to 99% of repulsion efficacy. Interestingly, we
have found a positive correlation between the strength of the PEG–substrate
linkage, the stability of PEGylated nanoparticles, and the protein
resistance determined by QCM-D.

II Experimental
Section
II.I Polymer Synthesis and Characterization
II.I.I Synthesis
Poly(ethylene glycol
methacrylate-co-dimethyl(methacryoyloxy) methyl phosphonic
acid), abbreviated as phosphonic acid PEG copolymer in the following
sections, was synthesized by Specific Polymers, France (http://www.specificpolymers.fr/). The synthesis was carried out by free-radical polymerization from
PEG-methacrylate (PEGMA, SP-43-3-002, CAS: 26915-72-0) and dimethyl(methacryoyloxy)methyl
phosphonate (MAPC1, SP-41-003, CAS: 86242-61-7) monomers, leading
to the formation of the poly(PEGMA-co-MAPC1) statistical
polymer (Figure S1). The conversion rates
of the PEGMA and MAPC1 monomers were determined during from synthesis
and showed similar time dependences, indicating that the copolymers
have the same number of PEGs and phosphonic acid groups (Figure S2). For this synthesis, the molecular
weights of the PEG pending side chains were 1000, 2000, and 5000 g
mol–1, referred to as PEG1K, PEG2K, and PEG5K in the sequel of the article (Figure 1a). Poly(poly(ethylene
glycol) methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid), in short
poly(PEGMA-co-MAA), was synthesized by free-radical
polymerization from PEGMA and methacrylic acid (MAA) (CAS: 79-41-4,
Acros Organics) monomers (Figure S2). The
resulting statistical copolymer is abbreviated as carboxylic acid
PEG copolymer. For this synthesis, the molecular weight of the PEG
pending side chains studied is 2000 g mol–1.

formulae of the statistical copolymers used in this
work. Four copolymers were investigated, three with phosphonic acid
and 1000, 2000, and 5000 g mol–1 PEG side chains,
respectively, and one with carboxylic acid and 2000 g mol–1 PEG. (b) Schematic representation of the statistical copolymers.

II.I.II Characterization
by Light Scattering
The weight-averaged molecular weights
of the polymers were determined
by static light scattering measurements (NanoZS Zetasizer, Malvern).
Toluene was used for calibration. The polymer solutions were prepared
with 18.2 MΩ MilliQ water and filtered with 0.2 μm cellulose
filters, and their pHs were adjusted to 8 by the addition of sodium
hydroxide. The scattering intensity was found to vary linearly with
concentration between 0 and 1 wt % (Figure S2). The refractive index increment of the different polymer solutions
was obtained by refractometry (Arago, Cordouan Technologies), and
it was used to calculate the polymer scattering contrast. The molecular
weights were derived from the Zimm representation and the zero-concentration
extrapolated scattering, as detailed in refs (21) and (32). The weight-averaged molecular
weights of the four polymers studied are provided in Table 1. They are in good agreement
with those of the targeted ones.

equivalent of acid groups per gram (meq g–1) of polymer was determined
from 1H and 31P NMR, leading to estimates of
the number of functionalized groups per chain.

For the characterization of the
iron oxide particles, dynamic light
scattering was performed using NanoZS, at a wavelength of 633 nm and
in a close-to-backscattering configuration, that is, with a scattering
angle of 173°. From the time dependence of the scattered intensity,
the second-order autocorrelation function of the light was calculated
and analyzed using the cumulant method and the CONTIN algorithm. Both
procedures gave consistent values for the hydrodynamic diameter, DH. For bare nanoparticles, the hydrodynamic
diameters were found to be larger than those obtained by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), attributed to the particle size distribution
and the fact that the scattered intensity varies as the sixth power
of the particle diameter.

II.I.III Acid–Base Titration
To
study the role of acid functionality in grafting, poly(PEGMA-co-MAPC1) and poly(PEGMA-co-MAA) adsorptions
were performed at two pH values, 2.0 and 7.4. pH 2.0 corresponds to
the conditions for coating iron oxide nanoparticles.21,24,46 Acid–base titration curves
have shown the presence of two pKA’s
(pKA1 = 2.7 and pKA2 = 7.8) for the phosphonic acid (Figure S3). For the carboxylic acid, the pKA was found at 5.5. For the iron oxides, the point of zero charge
is observed around pH 8.0. The surface below is positively charged
due to the presence of Fe–OH2+ groups,
whereas the surface above bears negatively charged Fe–O–.47,48 It should be mentioned here that
the iron oxide nanoparticles tested are made from maghemite γ-Fe2O3, whereas the flat substrate is magnetite, Fe3O4. As shown by Jolsterå et al. using high-precision
potentiometric titrations,49 the acid/base
properties of magnetite are similar to those of maghemite, except
for the difference in surface site density, estimated to be 1.50 nm–2 for magnetite and 0.99 nm–2 for
maghemite. For this reason, we assume that the two iron oxide substrates
behave similarly with respect to the acidic residues.

II.I.IV Characterization by Size-Exclusion Chromatography
The
molar-mass dispersity, Đ, for poly(PEGMA-co-MAPC1) and poly(PEGMA-co-MAA) was determined
by size-exclusion chromatography on a PolyPore column, using tetrahydrofuran
as the eluant and polystyrene standards. For PEG2K side
chains, molar-mass dispersity Đ was found to
be 1.81 and 1.78, respectively.21

II.I.V Characterization by NMR
Phosphonic
acid PEG copolymers were characterized by 1H NMR and 31P NMR using a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer operating at
300 MHz (Figure S4). From the molar equivalent
of acid groups per gram obtained by NMR, the average numbers of functional
moieties and PEG side chains per chain were derived. They were found
to be between 3 and 7, depending on the PEG side chain molecular weight
(Table 1). These findings
confirm the existence of multiple functional groups on the same polymer
backbone (Figure 1b).

II.I.VI Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
Iron
oxide nanocrystals of 6.8 nm diameter were synthesized by co-precipitation
of iron(II) and iron(III) salts in aqueous media and by further oxidation
of the magnetite (Fe3O4) into maghemite (γ-Fe2O3).46,50,51 The as-prepared particles are positively charged and have nitrate
counterions on their surfaces. The resulting interparticle interactions
are repulsive and provide excellent long-term colloidal stability
to the dispersion. The particle size distribution was determined from
dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The
crystalline cubic structure of the particles was assessed by electron
beam microdiffraction (Figure S5).52

II.I.VII Nanoparticle Coating
For nanoparticle
coating, we used a protocol established in 200832,46 and later applied for the development of magnetic resonance imaging
contrast agents for in vivo experimentations.24 Dispersions of particles and PEGylated copolymers were prepared
under the same conditions of pH (pH 2.0) and concentration and then
mixed at different volume ratios, X. The choice of
pH was dictated by the fact that uncoated iron oxide particles aggregate
under neutral or alkaline conditions. Following the mixing, the polymers
adsorb spontaneously on the particle surfaces due to the acid groups
complexing the iron hydroxide sites on the magnetite surface,32 resulting in an increase in the particle hydrodynamic
diameter (Figure 2a).
For the PEGylated copolymers studied here, no precipitation or particle
aggregation was observed following the mixing at this pH. The pH of
the mixed solution was then raised to 8.0 by sodium hydroxide addition,
leading to two distinct behaviors. Below a critical mixing ratio, XC, well-dispersed coated particles were obtained,
again, with a DH slightly larger than
that of bare particles. Above XC, particles
precipitate and form large clumps in solution, which eventually sediment.
Detailed investigations on polymer coverage as a function of the mixing
ratio are discussed in refs (21) and (24).

(FBS)-containing medium. Inset: intensity distribution corresponding
to the correlograms. (c) Same as that in (b) for carboxylic acid PEG2K copolymer coating. The data show destabilization of the
dispersion and particle agglomeration.

II.I.VIII Serum Proteins
Phosphate buffer
solution (PBS) was prepared by dissolving one tablet (Sigma-Aldrich)
in 200 mL of DI water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ resistivity). FBS
from Gibco Invitrogen, with a nominal composition of 23.9 g L–1 BSA, 13.2 g mL–1 α-globulin,
4.5 g L–1 β-globulin, and 0.155 g L–1 γ-globulin was used. The FBS was diluted with PBS at a concentration
of 10 vol % and used without further modification.

II.I.IX Nanoparticle Stability in Physiological
and Culture Media
For the evaluation of the particle stability,
the following protocol was applied.46,53 A few microliters
of the concentrated dispersion was poured and homogenized rapidly
in 1 mL of the solvent to be studied, and simultaneously, the scattered
intensity, IS, and diameter, DH, were measured by light scattering. After mixing, the
measurements were monitored over a 2 h period, and subsequent measurements
were made after 24 h and 1 week. The nanoparticles are considered
to be stable if their hydrodynamic diameter, DH, in a given solvent remains constant as a function of time
and equal to its initial value. The solvents surveyed here are DI
water (pH 7.4), phosphate buffer saline, and cell culture medium (Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium) with or without FBS. Stability assays
were performed on bare and coated 6.8 nm iron oxide nanoparticles.
Examples of temporal behaviors in physiological and cell culture media
together with the particle stability diagram are shown in Figure S6.

II.II QCM
A QCM-D-monitoring equipment
(Q-Sense E1 system, Biolin Scientific, Sweden) was used to follow
the adsorption kinetics of phosphonic acid and carboxylic acid PEG
copolymers on an iron oxide substrate. AT-cut quartz crystal sensors
coated with a thin film of magnetite (Fe3O4)
(Biolin Scientific, Sweden), with a fundamental resonance frequency
of 4.95 MHz, were cleaned by 10 min of sonication and exposed to an
ultraviolet (UV)/ozone cleaner for 10 min. QCM-D experiments were
carried out at 25 ± 0.02 °C in an exchange mode at a flow
rate of 100 μL min–1. The injected polymer
solutions were prepared at a concentration of 0.1 wt % and pHs of
2.0 and 7.4, adjusted with the addition of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric
acid. At least 0.5 mL of the sample solution was delivered into the
chamber containing the crystal sensor (of internal volume 40 μL)
to ensure complete liquid exchange. In a typical experiment, the crystal
was excited at its fundamental resonance frequency (f0) through a driving voltage applied across the gold electrodes.
Any material adsorbing or desorbing onto the crystal surface induces
a decrease or increase in the resonance frequency, Δfn = fn – f0,
of the nth overtone. Δfn is related to the adsorbed mass per unit
area (ng cm–2) through the Sauerbrey equation 1  where C is the Sauerbrey
constant (17.7 ng s cm–2 for a 5 MHz quartz sensor)
and n (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, or 13) is the overtone
number. An indication of frictional losses due to the viscoelastic
properties of the adsorbed layer is provided by changes in dissipation,
ΔDn = ED(n)/2πES(n), where ED(n) is the energy stored in the sensor crystal and ES(n) is the energy dissipated
by the viscous nature of the surrounding medium for the nth overtone.54,55 The combination of dissipation
measurement and frequency monitoring allows the determination of the
adsorbed mass as well as the layer viscoelastic properties.56 The Sauerbrey equation mentioned previously
assumed that the adsorbed film is laterally homogeneous, evenly distributed,
and thin and that the change in resonance frequency is solely due
to the adsorbed mass, including water hydrodynamically trapped in
the film. However, polymer films are soft, that is, they may exhibit
viscoelasticity, and therefore the Voigt model is more appropriate
for data treatment. The Voigt model uses frequency and dissipation
data from multiple overtones to calculate the thickness, shear elastic
modulus, and shear viscosity of the adsorbed film.57−59 In addition,
the model assumes that (i) the bulk solution above the layer is purely
viscous and Newtonian, (ii) the film is uniform, (iii) the viscoelastic
properties of the layer are frequency-independent in the range 5–65
MHz, and (iv) there is no slip between the adsorbed layer and crystal
during shearing.57 In this work, results
at overtones (n) 3, 5, 7,
9, 11, and 13 were adjusted to the Voigt model using the QTools software
(Biolin Scientific AB, Sweden). The measurements were performed after
mounting the crystals in the flow module and establishing a baseline
with water. The water was exchanged with PEGylated polymer solution
pumped into the chamber. The adsorption behavior of different PEG
copolymers at various concentrations on Fe3O4 was checked one after another, and DI water at pH 7.4 was used to
rinse the layer surface between each deposition step. The adsorption
behavior of 10 vol % FBS on the PEG brush was also studied using the
same procedure.

III Results and Discussion
III.I Stealth Phosphonic Acid PEG-Coated Nanoparticles
In
this work, 6.8 nm iron oxide nanocrystals were coated with phosphonic
acid and carboxylic acid PEG copolymers using the formulation pathway
described in the Experimental Section.50−52 In brief, dispersions
of the particles and PEGylated copolymers were prepared under the
same conditions of pH (pH 2.0) and concentration (c = 0.2 wt %) and mixed at different volume ratios, X. The pH of the mixed solution was raised to 8.0 by sodium hydroxide
addition. It was found that below the critical mixing ratio, XC, equal to 1.5 for both polymers here, well-dispersed
coated particles were obtained, with a DH about 5 nm larger than that of bare particles (Figure 2a). In contrast, above XC, particles form large aggregates and precipitate
in solution (as uncoated particles do), indicating an incomplete surface
coverage by the polymers. The dispersions studied here were prepared
at X = 0.2, that is, with a large excess of polymers,
to ensure that all positive surface charges were complexed by acid
groups. The dispersions were then dialyzed against DI water to remove
the excess polymers (cutoff membrane 50 and 100 kD). Dynamic light
scattering was used to measure the thickness of the polymer layer.
For dispersions that are not stable, light scattering also allows
estimation of the aggregation kinetics.46,53Figure 2b,c displays the second autocorrelation
function of the scattered intensity, g(2)(t), for iron oxide coated with phosphonic and carboxylic
acid PEG2K copolymers in DI water, respectively. The data
exhibit a quasiexponential decay associated with a unique relaxation
mode. Derived from the second cumulant coefficient (Zave), the hydrodynamic diameters were 23.8 and 21.8 nm,
with dispersity indexes of 0.08 and 0.18, respectively. These DH values are 9.8 and 7.8 nm larger than those
of the bare particles (DH = 14 nm24) and were ascribed to the layer thickness noted, hNP, to distinguish it from the polymer layer
thickness on the flat substrate, h2D,
defined in the next section. Here, we found that hNP = 4.5 ± 0.5 nm. With zeta potentials of −2
to −6 mV, electrokinetic measurements confirmed that the PEGylated
particles are globally neutral. For PEG5K, the polymer
thickness was also determined and found to be 8 ± 1 nm. The values
for hNP are consistent with those for
stretched PEG chains forming a polymer brush.38,60 As shown in the insets, the associated intensity distributions are
characterized by a single particle size. When dispersed in 10 vol
% FBS, the autocorrelation function and intensity distribution remain
unchanged for particles with phosphonic acid (DH = 21.8 nm, pdi = 0.21). This result ascertains that PEGylated
particles are stable in a serum rich medium and devoid of protein
corona. A comprehensive characterization study has also shown that
this stability is being maintained in cell culture media without serum
and for an extended period of time (>weeks).21,24 For particles coated with carboxylic acid-functionalized polymers,
the g(2)(t) relaxation
is shifted to longer decay times and the intensity distribution is
now peaked at DH = 85.3 nm (pdi = 0.21),
indicating a modification of the particle structure. The size increase
could be due to protein adsorption on the PEG layer, a scenario that
would be compliant with the corona model3,31,53 or particle aggregation induced by PEG-layer depletion.
From the light scattering measurements, it is concluded that the phosphonic
acid PEG copolymer is an efficient coating agent compared with its
carboxylic acid counterpart. Although the impact of polymer type on
particle stability is clear, the nature of the interactions of plasma
proteins with a PEG coating layer remains open to question. To answer
this question, a series of QCM-D experiments were performed using
iron oxide substrates grafted with PEG copolymers.

III.II Polymer Adsorption on an Fe3O4 Substrate
III.II.I Effect of PEG Molecular Weight
Figure 3a,b displays
the adsorption profiles obtained by means of the QCM-D technique for
the third overtone frequency, Δf3/3, and the related dissipation, ΔD3, of a 0.1 wt % solution of phosphonic acid PEG1K copolymers
at pH 2.0 and room temperature, as those for nanoparticle coating.24 Indeed, at this pH Fe3O4 is positively charged, with an estimated density of active Fe–OH2+ sites of about 1.50 nm–2.47,49 Upon solution injection (arrow at t = 0), the frequency
exhibits a rapid decrease and then a fast saturation at Δf3/3 = −22.7 Hz. Similarly, ΔD3 increases rapidly and reaches a plateau at
1.1 × 106. On increasing PEG molecular weights as
in Figure 3c,d for
PEG2K and in Figure 3e,f for PEG5K, the time-dependent profiles remain
basically the same but the Δf3/3
decreases to −29.4 Hz (with dissipation ΔD3 = 2.0 × 10–6) and −43.3
Hz for PEG2K and −43.3 Hz (with ΔD3 = 4.8 × 10–6) for PEG5K. These adsorption kinetics are consistent with that reported by
QCM-D upon deposition of polymers on various substrates.8,41,42,61−64 The polymer-binding curves corresponding to the different overtones
(n = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) are provided in Figure S7. Figure 3g summarizes the frequency shift data, that is, the
adsorbed mass (including the solvation water) for the three molecular
weights, indicating that increasing masses are bound to the substrate
depending on chain length.65 After the
deposition, rinsing with DI water at pH 7.4 has a little effect on
the adsorbed layer for the considered polymers. The relative frequency
gains after rinsing are 5%, 2% and 1.4% for PEG1K, PEG2K, and PEG5K, respectively, indicating that the
polymer layers are firmly attached to the substrate and that the stability
is enhanced for longer chains.

0.1 wt %) is injected. The second arrow denotes the time at which
DI water (pH 7.4) is introduced for rinsing. (g) Histogram for the
steady-state frequencies upon polymer adsorption and rinsing.

III.II.II Effect of Acid Groups
The study
of layer formation of PEG layers with phosphonic acid and carboxylic
acid, respectively, as linkers, at pH 2.0, sheds light on the role
of acidic groups of different strengths in the adsorption process.
At this acidic pH, indeed phosphonic acid groups are negatively charged,
carboxylic acid groups are uncharged, and the Fe3O4 substrate is positively charged.47−49Figure 4a compares the frequency and
dissipation binding curves obtained for PEG2K copolymers
functionalized with phosphonic acid and carboxylic acid moieties at
pH 2.0 and 25 °C. It can be seen that the carboxylic acid PEG
copolymer undergoes a strikingly different adsorption process compared
with its phosphonic acid counterpart. In particular, a well-defined
undershoot behavior is observed and suggests a fast adsorption/desorption
processes due to conformational rearrangement of the adsorbent on
oversaturated surfaces.66,67 Furthermore, the adsorbed
mass at saturation is 30% lower than that for phosphonic acid (Δf3/3 = −20.6 vs −29.4 Hz), whereas
the related dissipation is slightly higher, globally indicating that
the less carboxylic acid PEG copolymers are more loosely bound to the Fe3O4 substrate than are the phosphonic acid-functionalized
chains. Accordingly, upon rinsing, the carboxylic acid-containing
polymer shows a slight decrease and an apparent compaction of the
bound mass, which are not observed with phosphonic acid.

first arrow at t = 0 denotes the time at which the
polymer solution (concentration 0.1 wt %) is injected. The second
arrow denotes the time at which DI water (pH 7.4) is introduced for
rinsing. (b) Histogram for the steady-state frequencies upon polymer
adsorption and rinsing at the two pH values, 2.0 and 7.4.

To further assess the role of the charges on adsorption,
experiments
were performed at pH 7.4, that is, under conditions in which the phosphonic
and carboxylic acid are both negatively charged and the Fe3O4 substrate is neutral.48,49 The degrees
of ionization estimated from pKa’s
values are 1.3 (indicating that 30% of the phosphonic acid groups
bear two negative charges) and 0.8, respectively. Figure 4b summarizes the frequency
shifts for the two acid-functionalized PEGs at the two pHs (see Figure S8 for complete adsorption profiles).
In particular, the phosphonic acid PEG copolymer suffers a drastic
reduction (of about 50%) in the adsorbed mass from pHs 2.0 to 7.4,
whereas the carboxylic acid-functionalized PEG mass is adsorbed in
comparable amounts at both pHs. Again, rinsing has a negligible effect
on the adsorbed masses. Data from Figure 4b suggest that for phosphonic acid-containing
polymers, electrostatics is an important driving force for binding
to the iron oxide surface, as adsorption is related to opposite-charge
pairing and complexation.41,63 The lower adsorption
levels exhibited by carboxylic acid-functionalized PEG may result
from the fact that the acid groups and substrate are only weakly charged.
In this later case, other binding mechanisms, including H-bonding,
might be relevant.10,68,69 Overall, the data indicate that the most efficient coating and binding
to the Fe3O4 substrate occurred under acidic
conditions, with phosphonic acid groups interacting with protonated
Fe–OH2+ groups. The two different acidic
groups then interact with a strikingly different efficiency, depending
on the relative pKa’s of phosphonic
and carboxylic acid residues.

III.III Polymer
Brush Structure
Figure 5a shows the relationship
between the variation of the dissipation, ΔD3, and resonance frequency shift, −Δf3/3, during the adsorption process of phosphonic
acid PEG1K, PEG2K, and PEG5K and
carboxylic acid PEG2K at pH 2.0. Previous studies have
shown that the slope of the D–f plot reflects the layer viscoelasticity, depending upon processes
such as conformational changes, compaction, or hydration/dehydration
of the macromolecules at the surface.55,62 For phosphonic
acid-containing polymers, the ratio −ΔD3/(Δf3/3) is found to
be in the range of (0.6–1.7) × 10–7 Hz–1 and remains below the Sauerbrey limit, 4 × 10–7 Hz–1, typical of homogeneous and
rigid films.54,55 For the carboxylic acid copolymer
PEG2K, the undershoot observed in Figure 4a translates into a change in regime with
a negative slope 5 min after injection. The Sauerbrey equation (eq 1) is thus used to derive
the areal mass density of the film, which under the present conditions
includes both the polymer adsorbate and solvent. With increasing molecular
weight, from PEG1K to PEG5K, the areal mass
density increases from 400 to 750 ng cm–2 for the
deposition step at pH 2.0 (Table 2 and Figure S9) and 380
to 740 ng cm–2 for the rinsing step at pH 7.4. Values
in the range 200–1000 ng cm–2 are usual for
polymers adsorbing spontaneously at interfaces either via physisorption
or grafting-to mechanisms.41,42,61−63

a The mass (ng cm–2)
is calculated from the Sauerbrey equation (eq 1); the layer thickness, via the Voigt viscoelastic
model; and the PEG density, σPEG, from the polymer
brush theory.39 The reduced tethered density,
∑, is obtained from the expression πσPEGRg2, where Rg = 7.32 × 10–2Mw0.442 denotes
the PEG gyration radius.34,70

The hydrodynamic film thickness, h2D, was estimated using the Voigt viscoelastic
model.54,55 In the deposition step, the thickness increases
to 4.1, 5.7, and
9.4 nm for phosphonic acid-containing PEG1K, PEG2K, and PEG5K polymers, respectively (Figure 5b). The thickness of carboxylic acid-functionalized
PEG2K is 4.6 nm. After rinsing with DI water at pH 7.4,
the h2D-values are lowered by 3–10%,
the reduction being stronger for PEG1K. The values for
the PEG2K and PEG5K brushes are in good agreement
with those obtained by Nalam et al. using poly(l-lysine)-graft-PEG63 and by Emilsson et
al. using thiol-terminated PEGs.42 Note
also that the thickness of the PEG2K and PEG5K films on flat Fe3O4 substrates compares well
with that of the nanoparticle coating layer (Section III.I). From light scattering, the spherical
brush thicknesses were found to be hNP = 4.5 ± 0.5 and 8.0 ± 1.5 nm for PEG2K and
PEG5K, respectively, in excellent agreement with h2D = 5.7 and 9.4 nm measured in QCM-D. The slight
difference between the two determinations may arise from curvature
effects.60

To estimate the PEG density
at the surface, it is assumed that
the layer structure obeys the polymer brush theory38,60 in the moderate- and high-surface density regimes and that the density,
σPEG, and height, h2D, are linked through the relation39,40 2  where a = 0.28 and b = 0.72 nm
are the chemical monomer and Kuhn lengths for
PEG,29,42 respectively, and N is
the degree of polymerization of the chains. The derived PEG densities
are 1.55, 0.57 (0.28), and 0.15 nm–2 for PEG1K, PEG2K, and PEG5K, the value in parenthesis
being that of carboxylic acid-functionalized copolymers. A commonly
used parameter for quantitative characterization of polymer brushes
is the reduced tethered density, Σ = πσPEGRg2, where Rg is the gyration radius
of the chain in the bulk phase.34 For PEG,
we adopt recent small-angle neutron scattering results from Le Coeur
and co-workers,70 who found a dependence
of the form Rg(Mw) = 7.32 × 10–2Mw0.442. From the QCM-D data collected from the different
polymers, Σ is found to be in the range 3.8–11.7 (Table 2), corresponding to
grafting densities in the moderate (carboxylic acid PEG2K, phosphonic acid PEG5K, 1 < Σ < 5) and highly
stretched regimes (phosphonic acid PEG1K and phosphonic
acid PEG2K, Σ > 5).39 This
criterion to evaluate polymer stretching is similar to that found
in parallel studies focusing on the ratio L/2Rg, where L is the distance
between tethered points (L = σPEG–1/2).30,71 The decrease in σPEG by a factor 10 between PEG1K and PEG5K (Table 2) is attributed
to excluded volume interaction and steric repulsion between chains
during deposition. The already adsorbed chains act as barriers to
incoming ones, a mechanism that is more effective for longer chains.
As a result, the brush stretching and morphology are different: dense
and solidlike for PEG1K and soft and viscoelastic for PEG5K.42 These differences in structure
also appear in the different spreadings of the overtones measured
during deposition (Figures S7 and S9).55 The Voigt viscoelastic model also allows estimation
of the adsorbed mass from the layer thickness, h2D.72Table S1 in the Supporting Information compares the areal mass densities
for phosphonic acid PEG copolymers obtained from the Sauerbrey equation
(eq 1) and from the Voigt
model, showing good agreement between the two determinations.

In conclusion, phosphonic acid PEG copolymers are shown to adsorb
spontaneously at Fe3O4 interfaces and acidic
pH. The copolymer backbone attaches to the surface via multisite binding,
and the PEG side chains organize themselves into moderate-density
or highly stretched brushes of a few nanometers. The QCM-D results
confirm the data obtained in the bulk phase with iron oxide nanoparticles.21

III.IV Protein Resistance on
Phosphonated and
Carboxylated PEG-Coated Fe3O4 Substrates
We turn now to the protein resistance properties of the PEGylated
surfaces. To set a reference, we investigated the QCM-D response of
uncoated Fe3O4 substrates exposed to 10 vol
% FBS. As already mentioned, FBS is a part of cell culture medium
and contains mostly albumin and globulin proteins. Figures 6a,b displays the real-time
kinetics of protein adsorption in terms of frequency shift, Δfn/n, and dissipation,
ΔDn, for the different
overtones (n = 3–11). After FBS injection,
the frequency of the third mode decreases rapidly and levels off at
Δf3/3 = −57.6 Hz, whereas
at the same time, the dissipation increases and reaches ΔD3 = 4.2 × 10–6 at steady
state. With the ratio −ΔD3/(Δf3/3)
for proteins being lower than the Sauerbrey limit, the frequency data
can be translated into areal mass density, estimated to be 1020 ng
cm–2 here, at steady state. As for polymer adsorption,
the QCM-D data show no change in mass density upon rinsing with DI
water at pH 7.4, indicating that proteins are also strongly bound
to the Fe3O4 surface (Figure 6c). The slight decrease in dissipation is
indicative of a deswelling of the protein layer induced by dilution.
These findings, together with the values of the protein mass density
confirm the strong affinity and resilience of proteins to untreated
metal oxide surfaces.42,56,62

Figure 6 QCM-D
responses of uncoated Fe3O4 substrates
exposed to a 10 vol % FBS solution: (a) harmonic resonance frequency,
Δfn/n, with n = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, (b) corresponding
dissipation, ΔDn, and (c) areal mass density determined from eq 1. The first arrow denotes the FBS injection
time and the second arrow, the rinsing time.

With PEGylated iron oxide, the adsorption protein behavior
changes
drastically. In Figure 7a–c, Δfn/n and ΔDn are plotted for the different overtones following the 10 vol
% FBS injection. Stationary frequency shifts for the third mode are
Δf3/3 = −34.2, −14.3,
and −11.5 Hz for PEG1K, PEG2K, and PEG5K, respectively, illustrating that the proteins do adsorb
on polymer brushes in various amounts. However, these amounts are
lower than those obtained with untreated surfaces. After rinsing,
the effect is further amplified. For the PEG1K layer, the
residual frequency shift, Δfres,
is decreased by a factor 3, whereas for PEG2K and PEG5K, it is reduced to very low frequency shifts, −1.05
and −0.8 Hz, respectively. Related mass densities are 18.6
and 13.6 ng cm–2 (Figure 8a), that is, close to the QCM-D detection
limit. For these last samples, results suggest that proteins are only
loosely attached to the polymer brush and that rinsing at pH 7.4 washes
them up. Another crucial result from Figure 7 is that the addition of FBS did not modify
the PEG2K and PEG5K layer structures, as both
Δf3/3 and ΔD3 returned to their preinjection levels. Figure 8b displays a histogram of the
protein areal mass densities deposited on PEGylated substrates obtained
under the conditions used in Figure 4b. Here again, phosphonic acid PEG2K polymers
show the best results in terms of protein resistance. A schematic
representation of the different adsorption steps for phosphonic acid-grafted
PEG2,5K layers is shown in Figure 8c.

5, 7, 9, and 11) following the injection of a 10 vol % FBS solution.
(a–c) Data for phosphonic acid PEG-coated iron oxide with molecular

respectively. (d) Same as that in (b) for carboxylic acid PEG2K copolymers. For each plot, the first arrow denotes the FBS
injection time and the second arrow, the rinsing time. The residual

brush formation conditions. With a protein resistance of more than
99%, phosphonic acid PEG5K copolymers deposited at pH 2.0
is the most repellent layer. (c) Illustration of the different adsorption
and rinsing stages used in the QCM-D protocols, including cell preparation
(stage I), polymer deposition (stage II), exposition to serum proteins
(stage III), and final rinsing (stage IV).

With carboxylic acid PEG copolymers (Figure 7d), the QCM-D response occurs through a rapid
decrease in the frequency shortly after injection, followed by a linear
drift of the signal. After 30 min, Δf3/3 continues to decrease and reaches −40 Hz, that is, three
times that found with phosphonic acid-functionalized copolymers. A
similar behavior is obtained for ΔD3, which exhibits no saturation plateau. Rinsing keeps a rather high
residual coverage, associated with a frequency shift of −20
Hz and a dissipation of ΔD3 = 2
× 10–6. These findings confirm our hypothesis
that carboxylic acid-containing polymers are less efficient against
protein adsorption. The continuously varying QCM signal following
protein injection could indicate a progressive degradation of the
PEG layer, due to, for instance, the competitive complexation between
the added proteins and grafted copolymers. For all polymers studied,
the coverage bioresistance can be evaluated from the residual areal
mass densities measured on coated and bare surfaces.8,30,62 The protein adsorption resistance
coefficients for phosphonic acid PEG copolymers are 82, 98, and 99%
for PEG1K, PEG2K, and PEG5K, whereas
it is only 65% for the carboxylic acid-containing polymers. Polymer
adsorption at pH 7.4 does not impart resistant coating, as bioresistance
percentages are between 60 and 80%. In conclusion, the most repellent
layer is that made from phosphonic acid-functionalized PEG5K deposited at pH 2.0. On the whole, the QCM-D results suggest that
the agglomeration of the iron oxide particles coated with carboxylic
acid PEG copolymers in 10 vol % FBS (Figure 2b) is due to the combined processes of protein
adsorption and brush collapse. This latter phenomenon is also not present with particles coated with phosphonic acid PEG copolymers.

IV Conclusions
In this work, we aim to explain
recent results on the pharmacokinetics
of sub-10 nm iron oxide particles that are able to travel in the blood
compartment of mice for more than 2 h without being detected by the
mononuclear phagocytic system or cleared by the kidneys or the liver.
For in vivo assays, the particles were coated with PEGylated polymers
specifically synthesized for biomedical applications and their in
vivo distribution was monitored by time-resolved magnetic resonance
imaging. It should be recalled here that the same core particles without
a PEG coating have circulation lifetimes of a few minutes, that is,
typically 50 times shorter than those of the PEGylated ones. At the
molecular level, it could be shown that this remarkable property results
from the polymer multisite attachment at the particle surface and
from the adlayer structure. Here, we re-examine the issue of nanoparticle
stability in protein-rich media. For copolymers with identical architectures
and differing in their acidic residues, it is demonstrated that the
long-term colloidal stability is excellent only with phosphonic acid
groups as surface linkers and that in this case the coated particles
are devoid of a protein corona. For the particles grafted with carboxylic
acid groups, immediate destabilization of the dispersion is observed,
suggesting a protein-induced effect toward the coating.

To test
this hypothesis, QCM-D experiments are performed using
iron oxide substrates. In a first investigation, the deposition of
different copolymers either with phosphonic acid or carboxylic acid
is conducted under different pH conditions and PEG molecular weights.
Overall, the areal mass density and dissipation coefficient indicate
that the most efficient binding to Fe3O4 substrates
occurs under acidic conditions, with phosphonic residues interacting
with protonated Fe–OH2+ groups. These
findings suggest a grafting-to process driven by complexation and
pairing of electric charges. Estimated from the Voigt model,55 the hydrodynamic film thickness of the flat
iron oxide substrate is found to be identical to that of the nanoparticles,
indicating similar chain conformations in both cases. Comparison with
theoretical models allows concluding that the adlayer forms a polymer
brush in the moderate or highly stretched regimes. PEG densities (σPEG = 0.15–1.5 nm–2) and stretching
parameters (∑ = 3.8–11.7) are also estimated.

In a second part, the protein resistance of PEGylated built-up
substrates is assessed. The main result that emerges from the QCM-D
measurement is that whatever the layer extension and grafted PEG density
proteins do transiently adsorb onto polymer brushes in various amounts.
However, for the PEG2K and PEG5K polymers in
combination with phosphonic acid residues rinsing is able to wash
the proteins away, leading to substrate protein resistance efficacy
close to 100%. More importantly, it is found that in the above two
cases the addition of FBS does not modify the layer structure. In
contrast, PEG layers prepared at neutral pH, with PEG1K or from copolymers with carboxylic moieties are globally inefficient
against protein adsorption. With such coatings, the protein resistance
is mitigated down to 60–80%. The present study establishes
a clear correlation between the behavior of PEGylated nanoparticles
in biological environments and the protein resistance of PEGylated
surfaces made from the same building blocks. In conclusion, in the
development of novel formulations for nanomedicine, it is essential
that the physicochemical properties of the probes be predicted to
a high degree of accuracy and the new approaches challenge the paradigm
of the protein corona. The present work provides answers to these
two major questions, confirming that these goals can be achieved thanks
to tunable functional polymers.
