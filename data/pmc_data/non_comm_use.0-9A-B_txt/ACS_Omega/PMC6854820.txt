Compact
electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) can be applied
to the AC line filtering process and potentially replace conventional
bulky aluminum electrolytic capacitors. However, to realize the AC
line filtering application, the energy density of the EDLCs needs
to be significantly increased while high power density is maintained.
In this work, we demonstrate the EDLCs fabricated with ordered mesoporous
carbon, CMK-5, and small amounts of single walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs), which exhibit the highest areal energy density among various
EDLCs reported so far and power performance sufficient for AC line
filtering. High energy density of CMK-5/SWNT EDLCs can be attributed
to high capacitance arising from the bimodal mesoporosity of CMK-5
and high operation voltage owing to the pores compatible with ion
sizes in organic electrolytes. High power density is ascribed to the
high electrical conductivity and straight ordered pore structure of
CMK-5, enabling facile ion movements. Therefore, the carbon pore structure
is one of the critical factors to be controlled for the enhancement
of the overall performance of EDLCs for AC line filtering. Our demonstration
would greatly contribute to the scientific and technological advancement
of AC line filtering EDLCs.

Introduction
Electrical double layer
capacitors (EDLCs) or supercapacitors have
applications in a variety of technological areas such as consumer
electronics, transportation vehicles, regenerative braking systems,
medical devices, and microgrids.1−3 The performance of supercapacitors
bridges the gap between those of batteries and electrolytic capacitors.
Supercapacitors typically show 10 to 100 times higher power density
than batteries, while the energy density is lower by a similar magnitude.4,5 Hence, the enhancement of the energy density of supercapacitors
has traditionally been the primary focus to complement or replace
batteries.6−8 More recently, demands for the enhancement of power
density have increased because of new potential applications such
as substitution of bulky electrolytic capacitors with compact supercapacitors,
which contribute to the miniaturization of electronic devices.9,10 One of the important applications of electrolytic capacitors is
alternating current (AC) line filtering, which requires high power
performance. However, the power performance of supercapacitors based
on conventional activated carbon significantly falls behind that of
electrolytic capacitors.9,11

Recently, the
power performance has been greatly improved with
new carbon electrode materials, and it has been demonstrated that
supercapacitors can indeed be applied for AC line filtering. For example,
supercapacitors with vertically oriented graphene nanosheets, electrochemically
reduced graphene oxides, and vertically aligned carbon nanotubes have
shown sufficiently fast responses and maintained their capacitive
behaviors against 120 Hz AC signals.9,12−16 Their high power performances are attributed to their open pore
structures allowing facile access of ions; however, their macropores
are unnecessarily large, which lowers the density of electrode materials
and hence the capacitance. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that
supercapacitors with a compact form of mesoporous carbon such as carbon
nanotubes, mesoporous CMK-3, and Ketjen black (KB) can also respond
sufficiently quickly to 120 Hz signals.17−20 However, despite significant
improvement in the power performance of supercapacitors, they are
applicable only to low voltage AC line filtering. To extend their
application to high voltage AC line filtering, which has a much larger
market than low voltage AC line filtering, the energy density needs
to be significantly improved while high power density is maintained.
Therefore, it is indispensable to explore carbon materials with various
pore sizes, structures, and distributions, which is one of the most
critical factors influencing the capacitance and energy density of
supercapacitors.21,22

In this work, we demonstrate
that supercapacitors with ordered
mesoporous carbon, CMK-5, exhibit high areal energy density with high
power performance sufficient for AC line filtering. CMK-5 is chosen
because of its high specific surface area, electrical conductivity,
bimodal mesoporosity, and straight pore structure.23−25 A small amount
of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) (10 wt %) acts as both the
conductive additive and binder. Compared to CMK-3, which has been
previously demonstrated to be an excellent electrode material for
high power applications, CMK-5 has an additional straight pore structure.25−27 This provides increased surface area for charge storage while maintaining
facile ion accessibility. Moreover, the mesopores of CMK-5 exhibit
high compatibility with organic electrolyte ions leading to an operation
voltage of 2.8 V. The unique pore structure of CMK-5 enables high
capacitance and high operation voltage and simultaneously allows a
sufficiently fast response speed for AC line filtering.

Results and Discussion
SBA-15 is mesoporous silica with a hexagonal array of straight
pores and used as a sacrificial template for CMK-5 (Figure 1a).28 The straight mesopores are connected side-to-side by micropores.
The pitch and diameter of the mesopores are 9.9 ± 0.4 and 6.1
± 0.6 nm, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images, a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm, and
a low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the SBA-15 are presented
in Figure S1.28−30 Furfuryl alcohol
(FA) is a liquid organic compound, which easily infiltrates into the
mesopores and micropores of the silica template. Once the template
is filled with FA, a multistep heat treatment polymerizes and carbonizes
the FA (Figure 1b).
As a result, carbon tubes are formed inside the mesopores of SBA-15.23,26,31 The correct amount of FA is required
to form hollow carbon tubes instead of solid carbon rods.27 Finally, SBA-15 is removed by diluted aqueous
hydrofluoric acid (HF) leading to hexagonally arrayed carbon tubes
(Figure 1c). Ions in
electrolytes have facile access to both the inside and outside of
the straight carbon tubes arranged hexagonally (Figure 1d).32,33

Electron microscopy reveals the morphology of a
CMK-5/SWNT thin
film and the detailed pore structure of a CMK-5 particle. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images show a uniform CMK-5/SWNT thin film
prepared on a current collector (Figure 2a,b). The CMK-5 particles have rod shapes
with average width and length of 0.43 ± 0.08 and 1.20 ±
0.21 μm, respectively (the number of samples = 100). SWNTs are
well-dispersed and form a solid electrical network in CMK-5/SWNT electrode
materials (Figure 2b). SWNTs are ideal to connect individual CMK-5 particles because
they are highly conductive and mechanically flexible.34,35 They also provide high specific surface area for charge storage
and play the role of a binder.19,20 Mass loading of a CMK-5/SWNT
thin film is determined by the amount of CMK-5/SWNT used and hence
can easily be controlled. TEM images clearly show the straight tubular
structure of CMK-5. The top view of a CMK-5 particle shows the hexagonal
array of hollow carbon tubes with pitch and inner diameter of 9.6
± 0.4 and 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, respectively (Figure 2c). The wall thickness of the carbon tubes
is estimated to be 2.6 ± 0.4 nm. A lateral view consistently
shows both the straight inner pores of the tubes (indicated by white
arrows) and the pores between the tubes (Figure 2d). Low-angle XRD confirms the ordered structure
of the CMK-5 (Figure S2).23

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm
of CMK-5 powders
is of type-IV with a hysteresis loop at relative pressures of 0.4–0.6,
indicating the mesoporosity of CMK-5 (Figure 3a).36,37 Specific surface area
of CMK-5 is estimated to be 1483 m2/g, which is approximately
1.5 times higher than that of CMK-3.19 CMK-5
has bimodal pore size distribution with two peaks at 3.2 and 4.2 nm
corresponding to the inner pores and spacing between the carbon tubes,
respectively (Figure 3b). The XRD peaks at around 26 and 44° and Raman spectrum with
the G-band and D-band reflect the graphiticity of CMK-5 (Figure 3c,d).38,39 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that the ratio
of carbon and oxygen is approximately 96:4 (Figure 3e). The deconvolution of the C 1s peak shows
the presence of sp2 carbon in C=C, sp3 carbon
in C–C, carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, and carbonates (Figure 3f).

CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitors exhibit excellent performance in terms
of both energy and power characteristics. Cyclic voltammograms measured
at a scan rate of 100 V/s are rectangular indicating ideal EDLC type
behaviors (Figure 4a). There exists a linear relationship between the current density
and scan rate over a wide range of scan rates indicating the excellent
power performance (Figure 4b). The supercapacitors with 20 and 30 μg of CMK-5/SWNT
show linear relationships up to 500 V/s. As the mass loading increases,
the behavior slightly deviates from ideal linear relations. For instance,
the supercapacitor with 50 μg of CMK-5/SWNT starts to deviate
at a scan rate of approximately 350 V/s. Galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) curves also indicate that CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitors behave
as ideal EDLCs (Figure 4c). GCD curves measured at 1 mA/cm2 are triangular without
any noticeable IR drop. The capacitance increases from 910 to 2065
μF/cm2 as the mass loading increases from 20 to 50
μg. Furthermore, the high capacitance values are well maintained
even at high current densities (Figure 4d). For example, the capacitance of the 30 μg
supercapacitor reduces only by 9.5% from 1236 to 1119 μF/cm2, while the current density increases by an order of magnitude
from 1 to 10 mA/cm2.

densities.

The CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitor
exhibits 30% higher capacitance than
the previously reported CMK-3/SWNT supercapacitor with similar mass
loading (1236 vs 963 μF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2).19 The enhanced capacitance can be attributed
to the higher specific surface area of CMK-5. While CMK-3 is composed
of carbon rods, CMK-5 consists of carbon tubes. The inner pores of
CMK-5 provide additional surface area for charge accumulation. Considering
that CMK-5 has approximately 50% higher surface area than CMK-3 according
to BET analysis, the surface area of pores accessible by ions in the
electrolyte is less than that of pores accessible by N2 gas. Some portions of the pores may be approached only by smaller
N2 molecules but not by the larger electrolyte ions, probably
due to some irregularities in the CMK-5 pore structure.

The
response of the CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitor is faster with lower
mass loading of the electrode materials. The negative phase angle
of the 20 μg CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitor is 77.3° at 120
Hz enabling AC line filtering applications (Figure 5a). As the mass loading increases from 20
to 50 μg, the phase angle reduces from 77.3 to 70.2°. Consistently,
the supercapacitor shows smaller time constants for lower mass loadings
as indicated by the peak positions in Figure 5b. On the other hand, the capacitance increases
from 512 to 1331 μF/cm2 at 120 Hz as the mass loading
increases from 20 to 50 μg (Figure 5c). The increase in the capacitance with
respect to the mass loading is due to the increased surface area,
while the reduction in the response speed and the magnitude of phase
angle is due to the increased distance that the electrolyte ions have
to travel during charging and discharging processes.20 The results show that there is a tradeoff relationship
between power performance and capacitance.

capacitance vs frequency (Careal at 120
Hz = 713 μF/cm2 for 30 μg/cm2).
(d) Nyquist plots. The inset shows equivalent series resistances (ESRs).

Equivalent series resistances (ESRs) of the supercapacitors
are
all near 0.3 Ω as shown in the Nyquist plots (Figure 5d). Overall, the CMK-5/SWNT
supercapacitor exhibits comparable power performance to the CMK-3/SWNT
supercapacitor yet with much higher capacitance. The inner pores of
CMK-5 are straight, allowing sufficiently fast movement of the electrolyte
ions into the pores. The properties of the supercapacitors with various
mass loadings are summarized in Table 1. Electrochemical impedance spectra of the supercapacitor
are well described with the equivalent circuit in Figure S3a. Fitting results exhibit the capacitance and resistance
values that are consistent with those obtained experimentally. In
addition, we note that self-discharge is not a critical factor because
the timescale of the self-discharging process is much greater than
that of 120 Hz AC line filtering (minutes vs milliseconds) (Figure S3b).

AC line filtering has been successfully demonstrated
with an electrical
circuit equipped with a CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitor (Figure 6a). First, an AC input signal
(±3.25 V, 60 Hz), generated using an oscilloscope, is applied
to the circuit, as shown in Figure 6b. Subsequently, the AC signal is rectified by a full
bridge rectifier composed of four diodes into a pulsating DC signal
ranging from 0 to 2.48 V at 120 Hz (Figure 6c). Finally, the pulsating DC signal is smoothed
into a constant DC of 2.25 V by the supercapacitor in parallel with
a resistor (Figure 6d). The resulting output DC signal is constant without ripples demonstrating
the excellent AC line filtering function. In addition, the CMK-5/SWNT
supercapacitor exhibited excellent cyclability. The capacitance of
the supercapacitor decreased by 10.7% over 10000 cycles (Figure 7a). Most of the reduction
occurred over the first couple of thousand cycles and then gradually
decreased. GCD curves at the 1st, 5000th, and 10000th cycles are presented
in Figure 7b.

curves at different cycles (constant current = 10 mA/cm2).

Finally, the operation voltage
window of CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitors
can be extended to 2.8 V by implementing asymmetric current collectors.
The CMK-5/SWNT deposited on a Au/Ti/Al current collector has a stability
window between −1.9 and 0.8 V (vs Ag/Ag+), while
the CMK-5/SWNT deposited on a C/Al current collector is stable between
−1.6 and 1.0 V (vs Ag/Ag+) as previously demonstrated
with KB.20 With this asymmetric configuration,
the operation voltage window of the supercapacitor is extended to
2.8 V, which is greater by 0.3 V than that of the supercapacitor with
symmetric current collectors. Rectangular cyclic voltammograms measured
at high scan rates over 2.8 V are displayed in Figure 8a (Ccell = 1247
μF/cm2 at 50 V/s). Triangular galvanostatic charge–discharge
curves with negligible IR drops are shown in Figure 8b. Nyquist plot indicates that the EDLC is
highly capacitive and has low ESR (∼0.28 Ω) (Figure 8c). The Bode-phase
plot shows a high negative phase angle at 120 Hz (∼76.1°)
(Figure 8d). Both the
high capacitance (782 μF/cm2 at 120 Hz) and wide
operation voltage window (2.8 V) impart CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitors
with the highest areal energy density (0.85 μW h/cm2 at 120 Hz) among EDLCs developed to date, which have been fabricated
with various carbon electrode materials such as CMK-3, KB, carbon
nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, and graphenes, for AC line filtering
applications.17,19,20,40−44 Various EDLC properties including areal energy density
are listed in Table 2. Our demonstration would be an important cornerstone for the development
of high-power EDLCs and extension of their applications.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that
CMK-5/SWNT EDLCs exhibit excellent performance
for AC line filtering. CMK-5 has bimodal mesopores among and inside
the carbon tubes, which are hexagonally arranged with pitch and inner
diameter of 9.6 and 2.8 nm, respectively. The bimodal mesopores lead
to high energy density by providing high specific surface area for
high capacitance and compatibility with organic electrolytes for a
wide operational voltage window. Moreover, the straight pore structure
enables fast ion movement during charging and discharging processes.
CMK-5/SWNT thin films are prepared via a vacuum filtration technique
and used as electrodes. As the mass loading increases (20 to 50 μg
per electrode), the cell capacitance measured at 120 Hz increases
from 512 to 1331 μF/cm2 while the magnitude of the
phase angle decreases from 77.3 to 70.2°. AC line filtering has
been successfully demonstrated with CMK-5/SWNT EDLCs. Finally, by
implementing different current collectors, the operational voltage
window can be extended to 2.8 V. Combined with high capacitance, the
wide voltage window of CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitors leads to the highest
areal energy density (0.85 μW h/cm2) at 120 Hz among
various EDLCs.

Experimental Section
Preparation of SBA-15 Template
The P123 triblock copolymer
(4.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into 1.6 M hydrochloric acid (152
mL, Sigma-Aldrich) solution. The solution was magnetically stirred
at 38 °C overnight. Subsequently, 8.8 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate
(99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the solution and stirred for 6
min at 38 °C. The white milky solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined
autoclave for a hydrothermal reaction carried out at 38 and 100 °C
for 24 h. The product was collected by vacuum filtration and dried
at 80 °C. Subsequently, it was calcined at 550 °C for 5
h in air.29,30

Preparation and Characterization of CMK-5
CMK-5 powder
was synthesized by using furfuryl alcohol (FA, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich)
dissolved in trimethylbenzene (TMB, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) as a carbon
source and oxalic acid (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) as a polymerization catalyst.
The SBA-15 template (0.2 g) was added to the FA/TMB solution (volume
ratio of FA/TMB = 1/3) stirred at 60 and 80 °C for 3 h each.
The resulting composite was heat-treated under Ar flow in a tube furnace
at 150 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, it was heated up to 300 °C
at a heating rate of 1 °C/min and up to 850 °C at 5 °C/min,
where it was held for 4 h. CMK-5 was obtained by etching the silica
template with 5% hydrofluoric acid (HF, Sigma-Aldrich) solution.23,25

The morphology and structure of the CMK-5 powder were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FEI, Tecnai 20) and X-ray
diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku, D/max-2500 V/PC) using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.154 nm). Chemical properties were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) using Al Kα radiation (=1486.6 eV) (ULVAC-PHI
Inc., PHI X-Tool) and Raman spectroscopy (Horiba, LabRAM ARAMIS IR2)
with a 532 nm laser. Specific surface area and pore size distribution
were characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
(Micromeritics, ASAP2020).

Preparation of a CMK-5/SWNT Film
CMK-5 (2 mg) and SWNTs
(carbon >90%, Sigma-Aldrich, 2 mg) were dispersed in propylene
carbonate
(PC, 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich, 20 mL) by bar sonication (Sonics &
Materials Inc., VC 750) for 20 min. A small portion of the CMK-5 and
SWNT solution (weight ratio = 9:1) was taken, added into methanol
(CH3OH, 99.9%, JT-Baker, 300 mL), and bar-sonicated for
10 min. The CMK-5/SWNT solution was poured onto an anodic aluminum
oxide (AAO, Whatman, diameter ≈ 47 mm, pore size ≈ 0.2
μm) membrane. A CMK-5/SWNT film was formed on the AAO membrane
by vacuum filtration. Subsequently, the AAO membrane was dissolved
in a 3 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution,
which was eventually exchanged with fresh deionized water. The CMK-5/SWNT
film floating on water can be deposited onto a current collector by
gently removing the water with a syringe. CMK-5/SWNT materials were
deposited on a Au/Ti/Al foil or a carbon-deposited Al (C/Al) foil
current collector. The C/Al current collector was prepared according
to the procedure described in a previous report.20 The morphology of CMK-5/SWNT electrodes was characterized
by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi, S-4700).

Fabrication and Electrochemical Characterization of CMK-5/SWNT
Supercapacitor
A supercapacitor cell was assembled with two
CMK-5/SWNT electrodes, two current collectors, a separator, and an
electrolyte in a glove box. We employed a polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE, Millipore, thickness = 30 μm, pore size = 0.1 μm)
membrane as a separator. 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate
(TEABF4, ≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in acetonitrile
(AN, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an organic electrolyte. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV), GCD, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements were performed using an electrochemical analyzer
(Bio-Logic, VSP-300). EIS was performed using an input signal of 10
mV sine wave AC with a 0 V direct current bias. The AC line filtering
circuit was composed of a full bridge rectifier made of four diodes
(1N4004), a resistor (NTREX, 1 kΩ), and the CMK-5/SWNT supercapacitor
on a breadboard (E-Call, EIC-108). The sinusoidal AC input signal
was generated by a function generator (Keysight Technologies Inc.,
33210A), and the output signal was measured by using an oscilloscope
(Keysight Technologies Inc., DSOX2004A).
