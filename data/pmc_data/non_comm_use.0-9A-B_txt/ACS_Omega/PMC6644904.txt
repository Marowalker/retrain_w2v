==== Body
Introduction
Structurally complex
scaffolds with extensive applications in the
pharmaceutical industry have attracted the attention of the synthetic
community to design and develop expeditious strategies toward their
construction.1 Among which, spirooxindole
represents a ubiquitous skeleton and stands first with regard to its
structural complexity and pharmacological utilities.2,3 Particularly, 3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindole is a privileged scaffold,
which is found in a plethora of natural products and pharmaceuticals
that possess a wide spectrum of biological activities such as antitumor,
anti-obesity, and antidiabetic.4 As these
scaffolds also inhibit enzymes such as HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase and kinase and arginine vasopressin hormone, they are
useful in the treatment of congestive heart failure, hypertension,
edema, and hyponatremia.5 Considering these
biological properties, numerous innovative synthetic approaches have
evolved toward the stereoselective construction of spirooxindole scaffolds.6−15

3-Spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindoles can be traditionally synthesized
in a straightforward, diastereoselective manner by treating oxindoles
with bromonitroolefins.7 They can also
be obtained by reacting 3-ylidene-oxindoles with 1,2-dihaloalkanes,8 diazo compounds under the catalysis of dirhodiumtetraacetate,9 pyridinium salts in the presence of base,10 ethyl diazoacetate,11 or bromonitroalkyl derivatives in a Michael–alkylation cascade
manner.12 Alternatively, they can be constructed
by the ring contraction of corresponding spiro[pyrazolin-3,3-oxindoles],
which are obtained by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of 3-ylidene-oxindoles
with active diazo partners such as 2,2,2-trifluorodiazoethane,13 α-diazocarbonyl compounds,14 or the Bestmann Ohira reagent (Scheme 1).15 However, the aforementioned strategies suffer from disadvantages
such as lower yields; harsh reaction conditions; use of gaseous, toxic,
and explosive CF3CHN2; and requirement of transition
metal catalysts and active diazo partners. Considering these limitations,
investigations for alternate approaches that avoid usage of expensive
and explosive diazo compounds for the stereoselective synthesis of
these scaffolds are still in great demand. Moreover, in spite of the
advances being made, use of inactive α-aryldiazomethanes is
rarely exploited in the cyclopropanation of 3-ylidene-oxindoles.

Scheme 1 1,3-Dipolar Cycloadditions of 3-Ylidene-oxindoles and α-Diazo
Compounds for the Synthesis of 3-Spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindoles
On the other hand, tremendous
advances have been made in the field
of switchable intermolecular domino reactions,16 challenging yet desirable transformations that deliver
different products from identical substrates through solvent regiodivergent
procedures. Domino reactions have the advantage that minimal purification
is required and are step- and atom-economical processes. In continuation
of our interest in developing domino strategies toward the synthesis
of bioactive scaffolds,17 we wondered if
we could construct 3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindole by trapping α-aryldiazomethanes
(generated in situ from tosylhydrazide and aldehyde) with 3-ylidene-oxindoles
via elimination of N2 in a diastereoselective manner, an
approach that has not been described. To realize our goal, initially
3-ylidene-oxindole 1a was treated with tosylhydrazide 3 and aldehyde 2a for the anticipated cyclopropanation,
and to our delight, 3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindole 4a was
obtained with high diastereoselectivity (>95) in 88% yield. Surprisingly,
changing the reaction medium from CH3CN to EtOH delivered
pyrazoloquinazolinones 5 via the anticipated 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition, followed by an unexpected rearrangement. It is worth
mentioning that pyrazoloquinazolinones are also quite interesting
fused heterocyclic compounds with vast application in the pharmaceutical
industry. They possess AMPA, Gly/NMDA, and KA receptor antagonistic
and benzodiazepine receptor agonistic activities and also inhibit
phosphodiesterase 10A and vaccinia virus.17 Herein, we wish to describe our unique observation of solvent-controlled
switchable domino reaction between 3-ylidene-oxindoles and α-aryldiazomethanes,
which deliver substituted 3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindole and pyrazoloquinazolinones.

Results
and Discussion
To investigate the envisioned strategy as
shown in Table 1, we
commenced our study by
treating (E)-ethyl-2-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)acetate
with (diazomethyl)benzene, which was generated in situ from benzaldehyde
and TsNHNH2 in acetonitrile employing 2.0 equiv of K2CO3 in open air under refluxing temperature. As
expected, 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition/ring contraction occurred smoothly
and resulted 3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindole 4 (Table 1, entry 1) with excellent
regio- and diastereoselectivity. The structure of the compound 4 was unambiguously confirmed by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic
data. These interesting results encouraged us to investigate various
parameters that increase the reaction efficiency. Changing the solvent
from acetonitrile to other aprotic solvents such as CH2Cl2, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and toluene offered no improvement
in the yield (Table 1, entries 2–4). Screening of various organic and inorganic
bases such as DBU, Et3N, pyridine, Cs2CO3, and K2CO3 revealed that K2CO3 was the best base of choice (Table 1, entries 5–8).

and solvent (5 mL).

c The dr. values were determined by 1H NMR analysis.

To our surprise, use of protic
solvents such as EtOH offered an
unexpected rearrangement, leading to generation of pyrazoloquinazolinones 5. The structure of the compound was also confirmed by X-ray
analysis. This stimulating result forced us to scrutinize the reaction
parameters in detail. It is clear that EtOH is superior to MeOH, whereas
K2CO3 appeared to be an optimal base even for
this transformation (Table 1, entries 9–14).

With optimized reaction conditions
established, the scope and generality
of the regio- and diastereoselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition/ring
contraction reaction to assemble a series of 3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindoles
were explored first by varying the substitution pattern on both 2,3-oxindole
and aldehyde partners. As summarized in Table 2, the electronic nature of substituents on
2,3-oxindole has only a marginal impact on the reaction efficiency.
Accordingly, a series of 3-ylidene-oxindoles bearing electron-neutral,
electron-donating (e.g., Me and OMe), and electron-withdrawing substituents
(e.g., F, Cl, Br, and NO2) on the aromatic ring reacted
well with in situ-generated α-aryldiazomethanes and delivered
corresponding products with good regio- and diastereoselectivity (Table 2, 4a–v). It is pleasing to mention that phenacylidene and arylideneoxindoles
were also well compatible with the transformation, providing corresponding
products in good yields (Table 2, 4ab–ae). In the next stage,
we have also studied the reactivity of substrates by varying the substitution
pattern on the phenacylidene and phenylidine moieties, which delivered
corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Notably, the electronic
nature of substituents on the aryl moiety of α-aryldiazomethane
has discernible impact on the reaction efficacy, where electron-donating
(e.g., Me and OMe) groups provided corresponding products in slightly
better yields than the electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl and NO2). Furthermore, investigation on the effect of N-protecting
groups such as -Me and -Bn revealed that even N-protected 3-ylidene-oxindoles
could also be successfully involved in this transformation without
altering the reaction efficacy (Table 2, 4w–z and 4aa).

a Reaction conditions: 1 (0.5 mmol), 2 (0.5 mmol), 3 (0.5 mmol),

Encouraged by these fruitful results, to explore our solvent-switchable
domino reaction, we next turned to broaden the scope of pyrazoloquinazolinone
construction from ethyl-2-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)acetate and α-aryldiazomethane
in the presence of protic solvents (Table 3). A broad range of 3-ylidene-oxindoles were
converted into corresponding pyrazoloquinazolinones in moderate to
good yields irrespective of substituents on the aromatic ring of 2,3-oxindole
(Table 3, 5a–e). Oxindole bearing various electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing heteroatoms at the fifth position of the
2,3-oxindole ring are equally amenable for this rearrangement and
delivered corresponding products in good yields. Comparable variation
in the yields of the products was observed by changing the substitution
pattern on the aromatic ring of the diazo partner. Similar to cyclopropanation,
better yields were obtained with electron-donating substituents (Table 3, 5h, 5k, and 5l) than with electron-withdrawing substituents
(Table 3, 5b, 5c, 5f, 5i, and 5m). It is worth mentioning that this rearrangement could also be successfully
extended to even phenacylidene and phenylidineoxindoles to generate
corresponding pyrazoloquinazolinones in moderate to good yields (Table 3, 5h–m).

a Reaction conditions: 1 (0.5 mmol), 2 (0.5 mmol), 3 (0.5 mmol),

To further extend the synthetic feasibility of this reaction, a
gram-scale reaction was performed under optimized reaction conditions
by changing the solvent that delivered 3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindole
(4a) and pyrazoloquinazolinone (5a) without
affecting the reaction efficacy and diastereoselectivity, showing
its potential for bulk-scale utility (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Gram-Scale Synthesis of Compounds 4a and 5a
On the basis of literature11−15 and our outcome, a plausible mechanism was proposed
(Scheme 3). Initially,
aldehyde reacts
with TsNHNH2 and generates corresponding hydrazone intermediate A, which subsequently converts to aryldiazomethane B in the presence of base by the elimination of tosyl group. A formal
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of 3-ylideneoxindoles with aryldiazomethane B would afford intermediate C, which undergoes
decomposition in an aprotic solvent under elevated temperatures to
deliver 3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindole 4. Moreover, it
is also assumed that in the presence of protic solvent, intermediate C transforms into intermediate D by tautomerism,
which may generate spiropyrazole-oxindole E by air oxidation.15a,15c Intermediate E after spontaneous rearrangement delivers
pyrazoloquinazolinones 5 via a ring-expanded intermediate F.15d

Mechanism
Conclusions
In
summary, an attractive, switchable solvent-controlled product-selectivity
domino reaction between 3-ylideneoxindoles and an in situ-generated
α-aryldiazo compound has been developed for the synthesis of
3-spirocyclopropyl-2-oxindole and pyrazoloquinazolinones with high
regio- and diastereoselectivity. Two types of domino reactions, i.e.,
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition/ring contraction and unprecedented 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition/ring expansion reactions, were demonstrated by employing
variable solvent conditions from identical substrates. Broad functional-group
tolerance, absence of metals, and atom and step economy are the salient
features of the developed protocol. Further investigations toward
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions with methyleneindolinones and
evaluation of biological activity for the synthesized scaffolds are
currently underway.

Experimental Section
General Procedures
Unless otherwise noted, all reagents
were used as received from commercial sources. All air- and moisture-sensitive
reactions were conducted under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere using
flame-dried or oven-dried glassware with magnetic stirring. Tetrahydrofuran
(THF) was dried over Na with benzophenone and distilled prior to use.
Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) carried
out on silica plates (silica gel 60 F254, Merck) using UV-light, iodine,
and p-anisaldehyde for visualization. Column chromatography
was carried out using silica gel (60–120 mesh or 100–200
mesh) packed in glass columns. Technical-grade EtOAc and petroleum
ether were used for column chromatography and were distilled prior
to use. Organic solutions were concentrated under reduced pressure
using a rotary evaporator. Room temperature (r.t.) is 23–25
°C.

Materials
Commercial reagents were purchased from Merck,
Alfa, Spectrochem, or TCI and used as received with the following
exceptions. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether,
toluene, and 1,4-dioxane were dried over Na with the benzophenone-ketyl
intermediate as indicator. Dichloroethane and dichloromethane were
distilled over CaH2, and acetonitrile (CH3CN)
was distilled over P2O5. N,N-Dimethylformamide was distilled under reduced pressure.
Other commercially available reagents and solvents were used without
further purification.

Instrumentation
1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or
dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) as solvent on Bruker Avance 400, Inova Instruments, with 400,
300, and 500 MHz frequency spectrometers. The coupling constant J is given in hertz. Chemical shifts (δ) were reported
in ppm relative to the residual solvent signal (CDCl3,
δ = 7.26 for 1H NMR and δ = 77.0 for 13C NMR) and DMSO (1H NMR: δ = 2.54 and 13C NMR: δ = 39.52 ppm). Chemical shifts (ppm) were recorded
with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference standard or
TMS (δ = 0.0) as the internal standard, and signal patterns
are indicated as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet of
doublet, dt = doublet of triplet, t = triplet, q = quartet, qd = quartet
of doublet, m = multiplet, br = broad, and tt = triplet of triplet.
IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker infrared spectrophotometer and
are reported as cm–1. High-resolution mass spectra
(HRMS) were recorded on a Waters-TOF spectrometer.

General Procedure
for the Preparation of Spirocyclopropyloxindoles
(4a–ae)
3-Ylideneoxindole 1 (0.50 mmol), arylaldehyde 2 (0.50 mmol), and TsNHNH23 (0.50
mmol) were stirred in 5.0 mL of CH3CN at room temperature
in a 10 mL Schlenk tube for 10 min. Then, to this solution was added
K2CO3 (1.0 mmol) at the same temperature and
the reaction mixture was stirred at refluxing temperature for 2 h.
Upon the completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the reaction
mixture was cooled to room temperature and diluted with 10 mL of water
and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL). The organic layers were
combined and washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After the solvent was removed under reduced pressure,
the crude product was purified by flash column chromatography on silica
gel (petroleum ether/EtOAc) to afford the desired product 4.

General
Procedure for the Preparation of Dihydropyrazoloquinazolones
(5a–m)
3-Ylideneoxindole 1 (0.50 mmol), arylaldehyde 2 (0.50 mmol), and TsNHNH23 (93 mg,
0.50 mmol) were stirred in 5.0 mL of C2H5OH
at room temperature in a 10 mL Schlenk tube for 10 min. Then, to this
solution was added K2CO3 (1.50 mmol) at the
same temperature and the reaction mixture was stirred at refluxing
temperature for 2 h. Upon the completion of the reaction (monitored
by TLC), the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted
with 10 mL of water, and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL). The
organic layers were combined and washed with brine and dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4. After the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by flash column
chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/EtOAc) to afford the
desired product 5.
