Since
Earth was formed, in the Precambrian era up until our present
days, electric current has participated in the morphology and chemical
composition of organic and inorganic structures. Attempting to elucidate
the mechanism by which electric current participated in the creation
of the first cell in the Precambrian era is an intriguing and of a
permanent subject of interest to be studied. One way of emulating
the formation of structures similar to those that might have existed
in the Precambrian era in the presence of a biomolecule and an electric
current source is to use as a model, the silica–carbonate of
alkaline earth metal compounds known as biomorphs. The objective of
this work was to assess the influence exerted by an electric current
(negatively or positively charged indium tin oxide electrodes) on
the formation of biomorphs in the presence of RNA. The compounds obtained
under both electric charges were visualized through scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and their chemical composition was analyzed through
Raman spectroscopy. The biomorphs obtained under a positive electric
current correspond to aragonite-type BaCO3(I) and calcite-type
BaCO3(II). Whereas, under a negative current, carbon graphite
and aragonite-type BaCO3(I) were obtained. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing that the presence
of RNA and the electric current is fundamental in the rearrangement
of atoms, suggesting that organic and inorganic compounds have coexisted
since the primitive era.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The Precambrian era is considered the first and longest geological
era in the history of the Earth. This stage is critical in the genesis
of the geological and natural history of the Earth because life and
rocks were originated in this period.1,2 The most important
characteristics of this period are a reducing atmosphere, high temperatures,
and constant thunderstorms with lots of electricity, revealing that
since its formation, the Earth is under a constant exchange of electricity.
The complex patterns followed by electric currents and magnetic fields
surrounding the Earth respond to an adjustment of electric charges
in our planet with respect to the potent electric field of the sun.
Atmospheric electricity results from the ionization of the atmosphere
by solar radiation and from the movement of ion clouds.3 In this way, the Earth is electrically charged
and acts as a huge spherical capacitor. The surface of the Earth is
negatively charged,4−7 whereas a positive charge of the same magnitude resides in the atmosphere,
which gives origin to a flow of currents. It has been reported that
the negative charge is carried over to the Earth during storms, and
the descendent flow of positive current during good weather is counteracted
by a returning flow of the positive current from zones of the Earth
with storms.5,7 These facts indicate that because
the electric current exists since the Precambrian era, the electric
charge is a part of the main components of the chemical reactions
in the origin of life. This fact was considered by Miller (1953),8 who, in his experiment synthesized amino acids
emulating the conditions of the Precambrian era, also included an
electric current generated by electrodes.8,9 This
is relevant because apparently life is associated to electric forces
that direct all the processes inside the cell. Attempting to elucidate
the mechanism by which the electric current participated in the formation
of the first living cells in the Precambrian era is an exciting and
intriguing subject that must be approached emulating, as best as possible,
the conditions existing in the primitive era of the Earth. This is
the way by which our results will allow us to understand how the electric
charge influences organisms nowadays. One way of emulating the formation
of structures similar to those that could have existed in the Precambrian
era in the presence of a biomolecule, such as RNA, and an electric
current source is used as a model could be silica–carbonate
of alkaline earth metals (Ba, Ca, and Sr) known as biomorphs. In the
first place, they present morphologies that resemble fossil organisms
that have been found in deep marine rocks, such as radiolarians, diatoms,
foraminifera, and trilobites.10 These organisms
are considered to represent the past and present of our planet. In
the second place, they are a good model of study to analyze the participation
of the electric current, as they are silica–carbonate compounds
whose chemical composition has been widely reported, as well as their
crystalline structure in different conditions,11−14 except under the influence of
an electric current. Finally, in the third place, growing crystals
of the polymorph in the presence of an electric current (dc/ac) is
a novel method that can be used in any type of crystal growth. In
this way, we attempt to understand how the electric current affects
the formation of silica–carbonates both in the presence and
in the absence of a biomolecule. The goal of the present contribution
was to assess the influence exerted by an electric current (negative
or positive charge) in the formation of crystalline silica–carbonate
of Ba(II), in the presence of RNA, which is the first described biomolecule
that was formed in the Precambrian era.15,16 In this research,
we have used RNA from Candida species
(Candida albicans), which is a very
ancient fungus that has colonized other kingdoms. The structures formed
under both electric charges were visualized through scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and the chemical composition was analyzed through
Raman spectroscopy. The synthesis of biomorphs obtained under positive
electric current correspond to aragonite-type BaCO3(I)
and calcite-type BaCO3(II), whereas under negative current,
we obtained carbon graphite and aragonite-type BaCO3(I).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that shows
that the presence of RNA and electricity is fundamental in the rearrangement
of atoms, suggesting that organic (formed by carbon) and inorganic
compounds coexisted in the Precambrian era and could have some implications
in the chemical origin of life on Earth.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Fungal Strain Used
The strain C. albicans was used for RNA extraction. The yeast
cells were cultured in a YPD medium (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L
peptone, and 20 g/L glucose) and incubated at 28 °C during 24
h.

2.2 RNA Extraction
The total RNA was
extracted from C. albicans using the
TRIzol (Invitrogen) method. To prepare each sample, 1.5 mL of the
culture medium was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000g, and the supernatant was discarded; this was performed three or
four times according to the size of the pellet. To homogenize the
samples, cells were maintained, and the supernatant was discarded;
then 0.75 mL of TRIzol was added per each 0.25 mL of the sample. Cellular
lysis was performed through cell rupture with a vortex. Thereafter,
the homogenized sample was incubated for 5 min at room temperature;
this was done to attain a complete dissociation of the nucleus–protein
complex. Once the complete dissociation had been achieved, 0.2 mL
of chloroform was added per each 1 mL of TRIzol, and the assay tube
was vigorously shaken for 15 s and then incubated for 2–3 min
at room temperature. Thereafter, the sample was centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the aqueous phase was removed
with a micropipette inclining the assay tube to 45°; the aqueous
phase was placed into a new tube for RNA isolation; 0.5 mL of isopropanol
was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10
min; then, it was centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min
at 4 °C. To wash RNA, the supernatant was removed with a micropipette,
leaving only the RNA pellet, and adding 1 mL of 75% ethanol (molecular
biology grade) per each 1 mL of TRIzol; this was mixed softly and
centrifuged at 7500g for 5 min at 4 °C. Then,
the pellet was resuspended in 25 μL of water containing 1% diethyl
pyrocarbonate (DEPC, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After obtaining
the RNA, 1 μL of DNAseI (Invitrogen), 1.5 μL of DNAse
buffer, and 2.5 μL of DEPC water were added to 10 μL of
RNA. The concentration of total RNA was determined with a NanoDrop
2000/2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) at 260 nm. The obtained
RNA was used to form the biomorphs.

2.3 Biomorphs
Formation
Biomorphs were
synthesized in different mixtures and conditions (see Table 1). Biomorphs were synthesized
through the gas diffusion method.17 This
synthesis was performed using an ad hoc growth cell made of indium
tin oxide (ITO) (a glass-square electrode constituted by ITO) with
an O-ring. It is important to remark that the ITO electrode is a semiconductor
type n material pertaining to the group of transparent conductive
oxides of 1 mm thickness; the size of the used ITO was of 10 mm height
by 10 mm width. The conductive part of the ITO electrode with a plastic
O-ring (this was fixed with vacuum grease) was the first part of the
cell’s design. Then the mixture (solution of synthesis) was
poured inside the O-ring. Then, the solution was covered with an electrochemical
fluid cell for atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) containing a platinum
wire electrode (working as counter electrode). This experimental set
up was fixed using an electrochemical modulus of the atomic force
microscope (AFM-Bruker NanoScope 8HR) with a temperature controller
to keep the temperature constant along all the experiments. Finally,
a constant electric current of 2 μA was applied using a galvanostat
(VIMAR FC17, Mexico). The polarity of the ITO electrode with an O-ring
was fixed changing the position of the alligators (clamps) creating
a positively charged electrode (anode, red in color) or negatively
charged electrode (cathode, black in color), as shown in Figure 1.

The synthesis solution poured on
the electrochemical cell contained
1000 ppm sodium metasilicate, barium chloride at a final concentration
of 20 mM, and 0.1 ng RNA, at a pH 11.0 adjusted with sodium hydroxide.
All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Experiments were performed at
37 °C. Biomorph formation took place in 24 h; all experiments
were repeated in triplicates.

2.4 Characterization
of Biomorphs
The
biomorphs synthesized in different conditions (Table 1) were observed through SEM with a VEGA3
model microscope (TESCAN, Brno, Czech Republic). Afterward, the biomorphs
were characterized through Raman spectroscopy. This method was chosen
because it has been reported as a powerful method to investigate polymorphs
because of their crystalline structure.18 In addition, in our another study, we determined the chemical composition
and the crystalline phases through both Raman and X-ray diffraction,
and the results were similar.13,19 Raman measurements
were made with a confocal Raman microscope WITec alpha300 R system
at room temperature. The Raman laser excitation wavelength is 532
nm, and the spectral resolution of the spectrometer is 1.0 cm–1. Raman spectra were recorded with a WITec alpha300
Series Raman atomic force microscope (WITec GmbH, Ulm, Germany) using
a 672 lines/mm grating with a 100× Zeiss objective (0.9 NA).
Nb:YVO4 green laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used
as an excitation source with 14.4 mW of laser power. Punctual Raman

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Biomorphs in the Presence
of RNA and a Positive
Electric Current influencing Their Crystal Structure
To assess
the influence exerted by the electric current in silica–carbonate
compounds, we used biomorphs as a model because they are silica–carbonate
compounds whose chemical composition has been widely reported as well
as their crystalline structure under different conditions,13,14 except for the influence of an electric current. The obtained results
will somehow emulate the electric current existing on Earth and will,
therefore, allow us to know whether the electric current influences
the morphology of inorganic and organic compounds, including living
beings. To assess the participation of electric current, the experiments
shown in Table 1 were
performed. In these experiments we evaluated both a positive and a
negative current on the formation of biomorphs. We also evaluated
whether a biomolecule such as RNA, in the presence of an electric
current, influences the morphology of the formed biomorph. The way
in which the electric current, either positive or negative, interacts
with the chemical elements present in the combination as well as in
the synthesis of biomorphs is as follows: when an electric current
passes through an atom, the theory of bands is followed, in which
electrons of one atom valence are the ones located in the most external
energetic levels allowing, therefore, the bonds between/within atoms
in the compounds or between/within atoms of the same type in a molecule
or a crystal (valence band). In turn, the conduction electrons are
those that have been promoted to empty energy levels, giving rise
to their greater mobility and eventually originating the electric
currents (conduction bands). To evaluate what happens within an atom,
we take silicon as one of the main components of silica (SiO2). Silica is present in our synthesis mixture, as shown in Table 1. In this chemical
element (Si), without electric current, when an electron of the valence
band is transferred to the conduction band, a hole is created that
acts as a carrier of positive charges because one electron is displaced
leaving an empty space that is equivalent to having a positive hole,
which is immediately occupied by the adjacent electron and the events
proceed successively. However, in the presence of a constant electric
current, the electric properties change. Hence, in the presence of
a negative charge, the proportion of electrons will be higher than
that of the holes, and the element will behave as a carrier of negative
charges. Likewise, in the presence of a positive electric current,
the element will be a carrier of positive charges (holes) with a lower
proportion of negative charges.

Aimed at evaluating only the
effect of an electric current on the formation of biomorphs, the first
evaluated combination consisted of Ba2+, without RNA, in
the presence of a positive constant electric current of 2.0 μA
(Table 1). Formation
of biomorphs was performed on an ITO plate, as indicated under the Experimental Section. As a control of this combination,
the biomorph was synthesized without electric current. Observation
of the morphology of biomorphs formed without electric current revealed
that they form a nonuniform sphere with slight protuberances (Figure 2a). Whereas biomorphs
synthesized under a positive electric current present hat-like structures,
similar to mushrooms (Figure 2b). Some of these hat-like structures present an apparently
smooth structure, however, most of these structures show a rugose
or fibrillose texture because of the presence of crystals (Figure 2b). In addition,
the fibrillose structures are joined by braided threads (Figure 2b). These results
show that the positive current does influence the morphology of the
formed biomorphs (Figure 2), which agrees with that previously reported in this section.
However, although a change was observed in the morphology of the biomorphs
obtained under a positive current as compared to biomorphs obtained
without electric current, it was necessary to identify their chemical
composition and crystalline phase. These determinations were performed
through Raman spectroscopy, as this technique allowed us to determine
the polymorphs of crystalline compounds.18

Figure 2 SEM
microphotographs of biomorphs obtained (a) without electric
current and (b) with positive electric current. All biomorphs were
synthesized without RNA.

The analysis of the biomorphs
formed without electric current revealed
bands at 96, 154, 225, 693, and 1060 cm–1 (Figure 3a). These vibrations
correspond to BaCO3(I) in its aragonite-type crystalline
structure commonly named witherite that pertains to the orthorhombic
space group.20,21

electric current and (b) with positive electric current. All biomorphs

From the biomorphs formed under electric current,
we chose several
biomorphs formed under positive electric current to be analyzed through
Raman, in which bands at 94, 139, 223–225, 694, 1060, and 1503
cm–1 were identified as shown in the analysis of
a representative biomorph (Figure 3b). These data are interesting because they show that
the positive electric current influences the morphology of biomorphs,
but not their chemical composition nor the crystalline polymorphs
obtained. The second evaluated combination was Ba2+, RNA,
and a positive constant current at 2.0 μA. Tables 2 and 3 show a summary of these experiments performed under the presence
of positive electric charge in the absence and presence of RNA. The
control of this combination was performed with the same components
but without electric current.

of biomorphs with RNA and positive electric current produced cluster-like
crystalline structures intertwined in the form of plates (Figure 4b). These biomorphs
were BaCO3(II) calcite type (Figure 5b). The third group was SiO2 (silica)
(Figure 5c)	
These results show that the
positive electric current influences
the morphology adopted by the silica–carbonate compounds formed.
In addition, the presence of RNA participates in the structural morphology
of the synthesized biomorphs because the morphology is different in
the presence (Figure 4) or absence (Figure 2) of RNA. Chemical identification as well as the crystalline structure
of the silica–carbonates formed with RNA in the absence or
presence of a positive electric current were analyzed through Raman.
The bands found in the control sample (RNA, without positive electric
current) correspond to the witherite polymorph (data not shown). For
the compounds formed with RNA and a positive electric current, several
biomorphs were analyzed and, interestingly, different chemical compositions
were found as well as different BaCO3 polymorphs (Figure 5). In the first group
of silica–carbonate compounds analyzed, peaks at 99, 145, 229,
695, 1063, and 2670 cm–1 were found, which correspond
to the aragonite-type polymorph of BaCO3, commonly called
witherite (Figure 5a). The second group of analyzed polymorphs showed peaks at 110,
191, 465, 625, 991, 1063, 2912, and 2971 cm–1, which
correspond to the calcite-type polymorph of BaCO3 (Figure 5b). This result is
really interesting and important because this type of polymorph is
not commonly found, and it has only been identified when BaCO3 (witherite) was transformed into the BaCO3(II) R3®m calcite type through high pressures
and/or temperatures.20,22,23 This result is relevant because producing the BaCO3(II) R3®m calcite type polymorph in a
constant positive electric current would be equivalent to generate
this crystalline polymorph at a high pressure and/or temperature.
In addition, the use of a positive electric current could be an alternative
technique for the growth of other polymorphs obtained under extreme
conditions such as high pressures and temperatures. The presence of
RNA and a positive electric current seemed to have a function equivalent
to pressure and temperature, as can occur in an element, metal, or
compound as a function of pressure and temperature, depicting different
crystalline forms, which is a feature named allotropy or polymorphism.24

combinations:
(a) without positive electric current and with RNA; and (b) with positive
electric current and RNA.

analyzed revealed peaks at 11 and 491 cm–1, which
correspond to SiO2.

The third analyzed zone was that where bright needles were observed
that when evaluated through Raman, revealed peaks at 11 and 491 cm–1, which correspond to SiO2 (Figure 5c). This formed material does
not correspond to a biomorph, although a crystalline system, it does
not have at all the inherent properties of the silica–carbonates
of Ba compounds. As a whole, these data reveal that the presence of
RNA with a positive electric current can lead to obtain different
aragonite- or calcite-type BaCO3 polymorphs. In previous
studies, it has been shown that biomolecules, being nucleic acids,
are the ones that direct the structural form of biomorphs.13 In this part of the research, we have shown
that with RNA and a positive electric current, we can additionally
modify the structural morphology of barium silica–carbonates
and change their crystal structure. The synthesis of two types of
polymorphs of witherite by the presence of a specific current and
RNA obtaining also silica (SiO2) is particularly interesting.

3.2 RNA under a Negative Electric Current Bioreduces
the CO2 to Graphite
In addition to assessing the
negative electric current in the synthesis of biomorphs, we analyzed
the influence of this current in the production of silica–carbonate
compounds. For this, the evaluated combination was constituted by
Ba2+ and a constant negative current at 2.0 μA. The
control of this combination was performed with the same components
but in the absence of the electric current. The control sample was
the same for both the positive and negative electric current as shown
in Figure 2a. Biomorphs
obtained under a negative current were visualized under SEM. Microphotographs
showed biomorphs with different morphologies, such as semi-spheres
divided by a septum (Figure 6a) that emulated dividing cells. The relevant and interesting
aspect here is that we have found this type of morphology under a
negative current (we must not forget that the Earth has a negative
charge since the Precambrian era, and it was precisely in that era
where the first cell was formed on Earth from the first biomolecules).15 This report is totally concordant with our data.
The generation of similar morphologies to cells (Figure 6a) suggests that possibly the
morphology adopted by the first primitive cell since the Precambrian
era was influenced by the negative electric current present on the
Earth in that era. This cell morphology has been conserved until our
present days. Other types of morphologies found were spherical structures
with rugose covers and joined by spiral-shaped loops (which emulate
the alpha helices in proteins) (Figure 6b). These data indicate that a negative electric current
does influence the morphology adopted by silica–carbonates
(Figure 6a,b). Besides
the structural morphology found under the negative electric current
(Figure 6) is different
from the morphology observed under the positive electric current (Figure 2). Table 4 shows a summary of these experiments
performed under the presence of negative electric charge in both absence
and presence of RNA.

Figure 6 SEM microphotographs of biomorphs obtained under negative
electric
current with different morphologies (a,b). All biomorphs were synthesized
without RNA.

To identify the chemical
composition and the crystalline phase
of the obtained biomorphs, several of them were chosen to be analyzed
through Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 7, the spectra of the different chosen biomorphs
showed bands at 97, 101–106, 138, 146, 155, 164, 225, 236–237,
673, 693–695, 1060–1064, 1361, and 2941 cm–1 (Figure 7). These
peaks correspond to the aragonite-type BaCO3 polymorph,
indicating that the negative electric current influences the morphology
of the produced biomorphs but not their chemical composition nor their
crystal structure.

different morphologies (a–c). All biomorphs were synthesized
without RNA. (i) Optical image; (ii) SEM microphotograph; (iii) mapping

The next combination that was assessed consisted of Ba2+, RNA, and a constant negative electric current of 2.0 μA
(Table 1). Interestingly,
these samples, observed under SEM, did not reveal typical structures
of biomorphs, as in the previous combinations. This combination revealed
leaf-type and layer-type structures (Figure 8a), clusters of brilliant dots or cubes that
emulate small squares (Figure 8b) and laminae in which circles and lines with apparent crystals
were observed (Figure 8c).

Figure 8 SEM microphotographs of biomorphs obtained under negative electric
current with RNA with different morphologies (a–c).

These structures formed in these conditions are completely
different
from those found in the previously analyzed combinations, which is
an intriguing finding. To know their chemical composition and the
crystalline phase of the formed compounds, they were analyzed through
Raman (Figure 9). The
compounds that emulate layers showed peaks at 122, 1362, and 1566
cm–1 (Figure 9a). These bands correspond to graphite.25−27

current with RNA with different morphologies (a–e). (i) Optical

This result is very interesting and surprising because graphite
was the mainly obtained polymorph as opposed to the previous combinations,
where only the BaCO3 polymorph was mainly obtained. For
the leaf-shaped structures (Figure 8a), their chemical composition and crystalline phase
were also analyzed through Raman. The Raman analysis in both the global
and punctual spectra identified peaks at 139, 1060, 1328, and 1594
cm–1 (Figure 8b,c), which correspond to graphite. These results were confirmed
by analyzing several biomorphs; besides, Raman spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for the identification and characterization of all carbon
members.27−29 For example, through the Raman spectrum it is possible
to distinguish within graphite and without ambiguity, monolayer graphene,
bilayer graphene, graphene with few layers and amorphous graphene.30 Based on reports and comparing with our results
in the analyzed conditions, it is clear that the identified structures
are formed by carbon, specifically graphite (Figure 9a–c). The identification of structures
with different morphologies but with the same chemical composition
and the same crystalline phase in the presence of RNA and under a
negative electric current is relevant and intriguing because due to
that several questions arise that evoke the chemical origin of life.
Let us take for instance the existence of a negative electric charge
on Earth since the primitive era, aside from favoring the RNA synthesis;
did it favor the formation of carbon structures? If this is the case,
why is it then that the morphology of the different structures of
organisms, from one cell to a higher organism, has been conserved?
Is it linked to the fact that biomolecules such as RNA and the negative
electric current have also been conserved? In order to understand
the mechanism by which the synthesis of carbon structures is favored
under a negative electric current and RNA, it is necessary to understand
first how carbon is formed from chemical reactions. These chemical
reactions within the atoms of the chemical elements present in the
primitive era would have been the first reaction to occur to give
rise to the first carbon structure and, subsequently, to the first
cell. In this sense, the first hypothesis on the origin of life from
a chemical point of view was posed by Oparin in 1938 who proposed
that the conditions of the primitive era favored the gradual chemical
evolution of molecules based on carbon, from which more complex organic
substances were formed. The formation of these complex organic substances
gave rise to the first molecules to finally originate life.31 Carbon is a widely distributed element in nature,
although it only constitutes 0.025% of the terrestrial crust, mainly
in the form of carbonates. Carbon dioxide is an important constituent
of the atmosphere and the main source of carbon becomes incorporated
into the living matter. But which are the chemical reactions by which
carbon is formed in its graphite form? The graphite in our reaction
mixture could have been obtained from the reduction of CO2 by means of an enzymatic-type mechanism (catalyzed by the RNA) because
CO2 reduction through redox reactions requires high overpotentials,32 as well as having catalysts of both homogeneous
and heterogeneous types.33,34 Our reaction mixture
was not performed with high overpotentials but with the presence of
RNA, which is a nucleic acid thw behaves as an enzyme with catalytic
properties.16 This is very interesting,
as this result indicates that RNA, in a negative electric current,
is capable of reducing CO2 to carbon in its more stable
form: the graphite (Figure 9). All these results are summarized in Table 5.

This evidence could help us understand the chemical origin of life
on Earth since the first biomolecule formed in the Precambrian era
was RNA.15,16 RNA, by acting as an enzyme, could catalyze
CO2, which was present at high concentrations, in that
reducing environment, together with a negative electric current, to
originate carbon. From the latter, more complex biomolecules were
formed that finally allowed the formation of the first cell. The fact
that RNA in the Precambrian era could have acted as an enzyme and
that our results show that in the conditions given under a negative
electric current (which emulate the net electric current of the Earth),
this biomolecule reduces CO2 to carbon in its more stable
form, agreeing with studies that have used enzymes capable of reducing
CO2.35−39 Additionally, in this combination of RNA and constant negative electric
current, a second group of silica–carbonate compounds was obtained,
which through Raman showed peaks at 96, 143, 226, 692, 1060, and 2495
cm–1, corresponding to the aragonite-type BaCO3 polymorph (Figure 9d). This barium polymorph is commonly found in barium biomorphs.13,14 The third analyzed zone was that showing brilliant needles, which
analyzed through Raman showed peaks at 11, 110–115, 233, and
482–486 cm–1, corresponding to SiO2 (Figure 9e). This
material does not correspond to a biomorph, although it is a crystalline
system, it does not have all the properties inherent to the barium
silica–carbonate compounds. Having found that the barium polymorph
is commonly found in other conditions, as well as SiO2 in
the presence of RNA and a negative electric current, this indicates
that organic (carbon base) and inorganic compounds have coexisted
since the primitive era. The Table 6 summarizes all the experiments performed and the polymorphs
obtained for each experiment.

As a whole, these results indicate
that the chemical origin of
life comprises a set of factors that include the chemical elements,
as well as the environmental conditions, together with the negative
electric charge in the primitive era, which gave origin to the phenomenon
called life. Our research group is working in this direction, however,
complete elucidation of the chemical origin of life does not have
an end insight.

4 Conclusions
The
electric current is fundamental in the re-arrangement of atoms
because under a positive electric current, a certain type of barium
polymorph is generated; whereas in the case of a negative electric
current, a carbon graphite is obtained through the enzymatic activity
of RNA. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that RNA
can catalyze the reduction of CO2 into carbon under the
presence of a negatively charged ITO electrode. However, our results
are barely a contribution in this pathway, in which several other
areas of knowledge need to be studied in depth before we can even
attempt to unravel in a forthcoming future the great mystery surrounding
the phenomenon called life.
