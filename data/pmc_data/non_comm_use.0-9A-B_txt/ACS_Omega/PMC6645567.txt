Telomerase inhibition
has been an important strategy in cancer
therapies, but for which effective drugs are still required. Here,
noncovalent hybrid nanoplatforms containing the tetracationic 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-pyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin
(TMPyP) and graphene oxide (GO) were prepared for promoting telomerase
inhibition through the selective detection and stabilization of DNA
guanine-quadruplex (G-Q) structures. Upon binding TMPyP to the GO
sheets, the typical absorption bands of porphyrin have been red-shifted
and the fluorescence emission was quenched. Raman mapping was used
for the first time to provide new insights into the role of the electrostatic
and π–π stacking interactions in the formation
of such hybrids. The selective recovery of fluorescence observed during
the titration of TMPyP@GO with G-Q, resembles a selective “turn-off–on”
fluorescence sensor for the detection of G-Q, paving the way for a
new class of antitumor drugs.

Introduction
Guanine-Quadruplexes
(G-Q) are high-order structures of DNA formed
by the self-assembly of guanine (G) bases, via Hoogsteen hydrogen
bonding into planar G-quartets, and subsequent stacking of the G-quartets
on top of each other, via π–π interactions.1 The stabilization of G-Q structures in telomeres
has been considered as a promising strategy to achieve antitumor activity
through the inhibition of telomerase. This enzyme plays a key role
in the maintenance of telomeres length in roughly 90% of human tumor
cell populations and prevents their senescence.2 Quadruplex folding in telomeric ends inhibits telomerase
activity because this enzyme acts only on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
and cannot recognize G-Q as substrates.3 Human telomeric DNA comprises tandem repeats of an overhanging single-stranded
sequence 5′-TTAGGG-3′, which are able to form G-Q structures
in physiological solutions and in the presence of suitable cationic
ligands.4 To assess the potential of a
compound as a telomerase inhibitor, selectivity for DNA G-Q over duplex
DNA (dsDNA) is a fundamental attribute. This is because the drug must
be able to recognize DNA G-Q in the presence of a large amount of
duplex DNA, in the cellular nucleus.5 Early
reports showed that cationic porphyrins have ideal features to inhibit
telomerase through the stabilization of G-Q structures, namely due
to their size, positive charge, and aromatic structure.6−9 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(1-methyl-pyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (TMPyP, Figure S1) is easily bound to several DNA structures,
establishing electrostatic interactions between its positively charged
groups and the negatively charged phosphate backbone from DNA, as
well as π–π stacking interactions between the porphyrin
macrocycle and DNA aromatic nucleobases. However, a major drawback
in TMPyP as G-Q ligands is the lack of selectivity against the more
common dsDNA.10,11

As such, new strategies
that circumvent this limitation are useful
to improve the efficacy of therapies based on telomerase inhibition.
As a striking example, the functionalization of graphene oxide (GO)
with porphyrins has been pointed out as a strategy to develop selective
and effective cancer therapies.12,13 To the best of our
knowledge, the research reported here is the first example addressing
the selective stabilization of DNA G-quadruplexes through hybrid nanoplatforms
comprising cationic porphyrins and GO. Unlike graphene, GO contains
both sp2 and random sp3-hybridized carbons with
a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface,
such as residual carboxylic acid, epoxide, hydroxyl, and carbonyl
groups.14 Although the structure of GO
is still under debate, it is commonly accepted that the majority of
carboxylic groups are located at the peripheral edges, whereas the
remaining groups are distributed over the basal planes of the GO sheets.15−17 In water suspensions, the carboxylic groups of GO are deprotonated
above pH 4.3, thus, conferring to GO a negative surface charge at
physiological medium (pH 7.4).18 Therefore,
in addition to the π–π stacking interactions through
the nonoxide domains, the negatively charged GO is able to establish
electrostatic interactions with the positively charged molecules,
such as cationic porphyrins. Here, noncovalent hybrid materials comprising
GO sheets and TMPyP have been prepared and investigated as selective
G-Q stabilizers. The porphyrin TMPyP was selected for this work based
on previous studies with both GO-like sheets19−21 and G-Q structures.22−24 Nevertheless, other studies on DNA sensing using GO-based systems
have been described in the literature.25 Examples include research on DNA adsorption/desorption mechanism
on GO,26,27 the use of hybrid structures comprising
metal oxide nanoparticles and GO,28 and
the development of a GO-based system for sequence-specific identification
of DNA molecules generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification.29

Results and Discussion
Free TMPyP
exhibits an intense Soret band at 423 nm in the
absorption spectrum, corresponding to S0 → S2 transitions (Figure 1). Significant spectral changes are observed upon successive
additions of GO to TMPyP: the band originally peaked at 423 nm is
red-shifted to 437 nm and its intensity decreases, indicating interaction
between the porphyrin and GO.19 These are
noncovalent interactions that occur mostly through: (i) electrostatic
attraction between the positive pyridyl groups of porphyrin and the
ionized oxygen moieties of GO; (ii) π–π stacking
promoted by the aromatic structures in both components of TMPyP@GO.
Earlier reports have explained similar red-shifts to the molecular
flattening of TMPyP molecules onto GO sheets, thus, the four cationic
methylpyridinium moieties located at the meso-position of the TMPyP
are rotated to lie flat in its plane,19−21 an effect that causes
an increase in the energy of the ground state.25 Furthermore, the intensity of the strong emission band
of TMPyP at 653 nm (inset on Figure 1) decreases upon the addition of GO. The interaction
enlarges the π-conjugation of the system and contributes to
the electron transfer from the excited state of TMPyP to GO, thus,
decreasing its fluorescence emission compared to the free porphyrin.19,30,31 The potential of free TMPyP to
promote telomerase inhibition has been explored because it has suitable
molecular dimensions to match, induce, and stabilize G-Q structures.22−24 As mentioned above, the free porphyrin lacks selectivity, and therefore,
the TMPyP@GO hybrids described here were evaluated as alternative
G-Q stabilizing agents. First, a DNA oligonucleotide containing the
telomeric sequence T2AG3 was selected because
it is able to form tetramolecular G-Q structures (abbreviated as (T2AG3)4) in physiological conditions,
in the presence of suitable ions (e.g., K+), and it allows
the formation of complexes with positively charged ligands.3,24 Furthermore, the selectivity of TMPyP@GO for G-Q was assessed by
comparing the behavior of such hybrids in the presence of a DNA oligonucleotide
containing the 5′-GCGCGCGC-3′ sequence that is able
to fold into duplex DNA (termed as 4GC) in physiological medium. Hence,
the association of free TMPyP and TMPyP@GO hybrids with the aforementioned
oligonucleotides was monitored by spectrofluorimetric titrations.
Upon addition of 4GC or G-Q to nonimmobilized TMPyP in a physiological
solution, the fluorescence intensity of the porphyrin decreased and
the emission maximum wavelength shifted from 653 to 663 nm or to 659
nm, respectively (Figure 2A,B). These spectroscopic alterations are indicative of interactions
between the positively charged porphyrin and the negatively charged
DNA, mostly through electrostatic and stacking interactions involving
the nucleobases. It has already been reported that TMPyP fluorescence
may be quenched upon G-quadruplex binding by photon-induced electron
transfer from guanine residues.24 In the
present study, a more pronounced decrease in intensity was observed
for the titration with the duplex 4GC when compared to G-Q. This result
suggests that TMPyP has a higher affinity for the common duplex DNA
than to induce and stabilize G-Q structures. This behavior limits
the practical applications of TMPyP as a selective G-Q stabilizer.
To overcome this selectivity issue, the previous studies were extended
to TMPyP@GO hybrids using both oligonucleotides for similar experimental
conditions. It should be noted that the TMPyP fluorescence in these
hybrids is quenched due to interactions with the GO sheets. The addition
of 4GC (able to fold into dsDNA) to the TMPyP@GO hybrids causes a
shift of the emission maximum from 653 to 664 nm (11 nm), while the
band intensity undergoes a small increase (Figure 3A). Conversely, the addition of the G-Q (T2AG3)4 to the TMPyP@GO hybrid causes
a shift from 653 to 660 nm (7 nm) and a prominent increase in the
fluorescence intensity (Figure 3B).

GO interacts strongly with ssDNA
through π-stacking between
the aromatic hexagonal lattice of GO and the ring structures from
the nucleobases and, possibly, hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous
bases and the oxygen groups of GO.32,33 On the other
hand, the adsorption of dsDNA onto the GO sheets is hampered due to
shielding of the nucleobases by the negative charges from the phosphate
backbone, the reason why GO displays lower affinities towards dsDNA.32,33 In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the TMPyP@GO hybrids
show higher affinity towards the G-Q formed from the ssDNA sequence
T2AG3 than to the duplex DNA 4GC.

The
recorded results resemble the optical behavior that operates
in a reversible “turn-off–on” fluorescent sensor
for the detection of G-Q structures. G-Q structures are able to get
closer to the TMPyP@GO hybrid, causing the release of TMPyP from the
GO surface, which gives rise to an increase in the fluorescence emission
(turn-on state). Thereby, the folding and stabilization of G-Q complexes
are enhanced due to the TMPyP release. The selectivity of the hybrid
nanoplatforms towards G-Q structures was further tested through the
simultaneous addition of both oligonucleotides to the TMPyP@GO hybrids
(Figure S2). As expected, the TMPyP fluorescence
was enhanced significantly and a red-shift from 653 to 657 nm was
observed. This observation suggests that the release of TMPyP from
TMPyP@GO towards the G-Q structure is still favored, even in the presence
of the duplex 4GC. To assure that the fluorescence recovery was not
related to a buffer effect, aliquots of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) were added to the hybrid materials and no significant changes
were observed (Figure S3). Besides, fluorescence
was not observed in the 653–664 nm range, when the oligonucleotides
were added to a physiological solution of pure GO (Figure S4). These control experiments demonstrate that the
fluorescence recovery is not due to nonspecific interactions of oligonucleotides
with buffer or GO, thus, supporting the hypothesis that the fluorescence
turn-on state is a result of desorption of porphyrin from GO with
subsequent G-Q stabilization. Furthermore, a comparison of Figures 2 and 3 above shows that the red-shifts observed in the emission
band during the titrations of TMPyP@GO with the individual oligonucleotides
are similar to those observed in the titration of free porphyrin.
This suggests that the final species responsible for the fluorescence
enhancements correspond to porphyrin and G-Q or 4GC DNA, i.e., without
contribution of GO. However, the results presented above also indicate
that the GO sheets in the hybrids do not have an innocent role in
promoting, or hampering, the interaction between the TMPyP and the
G-Q (T2AG3)4, or dsDNA 4GC, respectively.

This raises the question about the type of the hybrid structure
present, in particular, by considering that the nanoscale distribution
of the TMPyP over the GO sheets is certainly a relevant parameter.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of TMPyP@GO (Figure S5) have revealed GO sheets decorated
with darker flakes that we ascribe to TMPyP aggregates. These aggregates
are not evenly distributed over the GO sheets, rather accumulate in
certain regions of the substrate, likely corresponding to over-stacked
porphyrin layers. Indeed, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of the same regions
in the hybrid have confirmed that even the less dark areas of the
hybrid sheets were covered with porphyrin molecules (Figure S6). To have a better insight into the distribution
of TMPyP over the GO sheets, we carried out a Raman imaging study
on these samples. En route with this objective, we also demonstrate
here for the first time the potential of this approach to get information
about the spatial distribution of porphyrinic fluorophores on graphene-based
materials and the interactions involved. Figure 4 presents the Raman spectra of TMPyP@GO collected
on different surface regions of the sample (positions highlighted
in the optical image in Figure 4A), together with the Raman spectra of GO and pure TMPyP.
The most important vibrational modes and respective band assignments
have been performed based on the literature.34−37 Here, we have monitored the diagnostic
bands of GO at 1350 cm–1 (D-band) and at 1600 cm–1 (G-band), assigned respectively to the sp3-carbon containing moieties due to the defects introduced to the
graphene lattice and to the sp2-carbons of the two-dimensional
hexagonal lattice.34,35 Although a detailed characterization
of the vibrational modes of free TMPyP can be found elsewhere,36,37 the band at 978 cm–1, which has been assigned
to vibrational modes of the pyridine groups, and the band at 1006
cm–1, which is closely related to the vibration
of the porphyrin core, have been used here as diagnostic bands. It
should be noted that for the hybrid material the latter bands exhibit
intensities that are dependent on the analyzed region (Figure 4). This is most clear for the
band at 978 cm–1, which is enhanced in relation
to the free porphyrin, but whose intensity decreases as the Raman
analysis progressively moves on to the inner surface of GO (Figure 4, from regions 1–3).
This band is assigned to the in-plane bending deformation of the pyridine
rings, thus having a strong contribution of electrostatic attractions
through the positively charged pyridine groups and the negative charges
on oxygen moieties, that are mostly located on the edges of GO sheets.
The Raman band at 1006 cm–1 was observed in all
the regions analyzed of the hybrid sample, thus suggesting that a
layer of flattened TMPyP may be paving the inner region of GO sheets
(with fewer negative charges),38 mostly
through van der Waals and π–π stacking interactions.

spectra of the TMPyP@GO hybrid acquired at different sample regions

Taking advantage of the Raman signatures associated
with the two
types of chemical interactions involved between the GO sheets and
the porphyrin, the distribution of TMPyP on the GO sheets was mapped
by Raman confocal microscopy. The Raman images shown in Figure 5 show brighter colors for the
regions with the stronger Raman signal for the porphyrin (Figure 5A,B) and for the
GO sheets (Figure 5C). Figure 5A shows
the Raman image that results from the integration of the area of the
band at 978 cm–1, corresponding to the vibrational
mode of the positively charged pyridine groups of TMPyP, exhibiting
a strong Raman signal predominantly around the GO sheets. This result
supports the above interpretation that TMPyP molecules are mostly
located at the edges of GO through electrostatic attractions.

Figure 5 Raman images
of TMPyP@GO hybrids, in which the vertical bar shows
the color profile with the relative intensity scale. The images were
obtained by using the integrated intensity of the Raman bands of TMPyP
at 978 cm–1 (A) and at 1006 cm–1 (B), and the Raman band of GO at 1350 cm–1 (C).
The combined Raman image (D) was obtained by using two different Raman
spectra for the TMPyP decorating GO sheets, as shown in (E).

On the other hand, the Raman image
corresponding to the integration
of the band at 1006 cm–1, assigned to the stretching
mode involving the α- and meso-carbons of the
porphyrin core, indicates an even distribution of the porphyrin over
the GO surface. This result is interpreted by assuming a flattened
orientation of the TMPyP molecules on the surface of the GO through
van der Waals and π–π stacking interactions. Thus,
the combined Raman image (Figure 5D) based on the spectra displayed in Figure 5E, shows the overall mapping
of the TMPyP molecules that are interacting with the GO sheets via
electrostatic (blue area) or by van der Waals and π–π
stacking interactions (red area). Topography atomic force microscopy
(AFM) measurements performed on the TMPyP@GO hybrids are consistent
with the presence of GO sheets covered with TMPyP aggregates (Figure S7), as previously indicated by electron
microscopy. In addition, the Raman mapping performed in the same region
analyzed by AFM, by integrating the intensity of the Raman band corresponding
to the stretching mode of the porphyrin core (at 1006 cm–1), also indicates that the porphyrin is distributed over the GO surface
but aggregates are also present. For comparative purposes, a Raman
map is also shown for that region of the sample obtained by monitoring
the D-band of GO (at 1350 cm–1).

To obtain
deeper insights into the turn-off–on model described
above, Raman spectroscopic studies have been carried out using GO
substrates treated with solutions of TMPyP@GO containing each of the
DNA oligonucleotides, after the spectrofluorimetric titrations. In
this case, no significant changes were observed in the average Raman
spectra collected in different regions of the substrate, in the 1850–850
cm–1 range (Figure S8). In both cases, the band at 978 cm–1, which has
been used here to monitor the TMPyP@GO electrostatic interaction is
not distinguishable from the background noise. This result suggests
that the porphyrin molecules linked through electrostatic interactions
have been more easily detached from the surface of the hybrids, giving
rise to the fluorescence enhancement described above.

However,
in some regions of the substrate TMPyP@GO containing G-Q
(T2AG3)4, the absence of the band
at 1006 cm–1, assigned to the vibration of the pyridine
core, can be observed. This result suggests that the TMPyP molecules
are more selective for the G-Q than to the GO sheets, in
which they can migrate more easily from the GO surface and unbound
the van der Waals and π–π stacking interactions
to stabilize G-Q structures.

Conclusions
Overall, the results
achieved throughout this work provide a new
basis to explore functionalized GO nanoplatforms that selectively
stabilize G-quadruplex structures. Indeed, the noncovalent hybrids
comprising TMPyP and GO have been successfully obtained and their
complexation induced bathochromic shifts of the Soret absorption band
and significant fluorescence quenching. The hypothesis advanced in
this research considers that the electrostatic interactions are the
major driving forces to attract porphyrins to GO sheets, while π–π
stacking interactions will assure a homogeneous distribution of porphyrins
over the GO sheets. The stabilization of G-Q seems to occur through
a turn-off–on fluorescence process. Upon the addition of oligonucleotide
sequences that are able to form G-Q structures, the porphyrin is detached
from the GO surfaces leading to fluorescence recovery. These findings
open new avenues in antitumor drug design that envisages selective
anticancer therapies based on the detection and stabilization of G-quadruplexes.

Experimental
Section
General Remarks and Synthesis
All reagents were used
as purchased from Sigma-Aldrich due to their high purity. Solvents
were used as received or distilled and dried by using standard procedures
according to the literature.39

Commercial
graphene oxide aqueous suspensions (2 mg/mL, Nanocs) were centrifuged
twice at 13 300 rpm for 5 min, and the solid was redispersed
in deionized water to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. The neutral
precursor of TMPyP, 5,10,15,20-tetra-(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP, Figure S1) was synthesized through the reaction
of 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde with pyrrole in refluxing acetic acid
and nitrobenzene for 1 h at 120 °C.40,41 After chromatographic purification, the quaternization of the pyridine
units in TPyP was performed in the presence of iodomethane in dimethylformamide
for 24 h at 40 °C, affording the desired cationic porphyrin TMPyP.
The structure of all the synthesized compounds (Figure S1) was confirmed by 1H NMR (Bruker DRX
300, 300.13 MHz) and ESI-MS (Micromass Q-Tof-2).

A stock aqueous
solution of TMPyP 50 μM was prepared and
then diluted to 2 μM. The preparation of the TMPyP@GO hybrid
was monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy and spectrofluorimetric
titrations. Briefly, these titrations were performed at room temperature
by the successive addition of 10 μL aliquots of the GO aqueous
suspension (1 mg/mL) to 1 mL of an aqueous solution of the porphyrin
(2 μM). After adding each aliquot, the mixture was allowed to
rest for 1 min, to assure a higher reproducibility in the results.
The interactions between GO and the porphyrin were monitored through
the red-shift in the position of the Soret band and by the quenching
of porphyrin fluorescence. GO was continuously added to the porphyrin
solutions until obtaining three consecutive and similar measurement
values of red-shift and fluorescence, meaning that optimal interactions
were achieved. In total, a volume of 50 μL of GO was added to
each 1 mL of porphyrin solution.

Assembly Assays Using DNA
Oligonucleotides
To test
the selectivity of the hybrids towards G-Q structures versus duplex
DNA, the selected sequences were: 5′-TTAGGG-3′, able
to fold into a tetramolecular G-Q structure (abbreviated as (T2AG3)4) and 5′-GCGCGCGC-3′,
which folds as duplex DNA (abbreviated as 4GC). The DNA oligonucleotides
were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Germany). A phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution, containing 20 mM of phosphate buffer (10 mL
of KH2PO4 1 M and 200 μL of K2HPO4 1 M), 0.1 mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,
and 100 mM of KCl was prepared and the final pH was adjusted to 6.8.
PBS solution was used as the solvent for TMPyP, GO, and oligonucleotides
during the titrations. Each oligonucleotide was heated up to 85 °C
for 10 min and left to cool overnight to assure the correct folding
into duplex or G-Q structures. The concentrations of oligonucleotides
in a single chain was determined by absorption spectrophotometry at
260 nm after the heating process described above and the final oligonucleotides
had a concentration of ca. 15 μM. To ensure better reproducibility
in the behavior of the hybrids in the presence of DNA in the spectrofluorimetric
titrations, an excess of negatively charged GO (5 μL of GO 3
mg/mL) was added to each 1 mL of TMPyP@GO (porphyrin concentration
2 μM) before adding the DNA aliquots. During the spectrofluorimetric
titrations, all the compounds were dissolved in PBS to mimic the physiological
conditions. The emission spectra were recorded after excitation at
423 nm (TMPyP Soret band). The fluorescence values were corrected
according to the dilution effect and the same amounts of oligonucleotides
were added to the compounds to facilitate the comparison.

Instrumentation
All the UV–vis absorption spectra
were recorded using a Jasco V-560 spectrophotometer, by placing the
samples in quartz cells of 1 cm length. All the spectra were analyzed
in the 195–850 nm range but the analysis was more detailed
in the Soret band (350–500 nm) absorption region due to porphyrin
absorption: Soret (350–500 nm) and Q-band (500–700)
regions. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured with a Jasco
FP-8300 spectrofluorometer. These spectra were obtained in the range
of 433–750 nm by exciting the sample at the porphyrin Soret
absorption maxima (423 nm). Excitation and emission slits were set
at 10 and 5 nm, respectively. All the spectra were mathematically
corrected for the dilution effect.

Raman studies were performed
in a combined Raman-AFM confocal microscope WITec alpha300 RAS+. Drops
of each hybrid solution and free GO were left to dry on glass substrates
and then excited with a 532 nm line of a Nd:YAG laser (2 s, 10 acquisitions,
1 mW laser power). For Raman analyses of the hybrids with DNA oligonucleotides,
a drop of each sample was collected and left to dry for 3 days before
the measurements. To avoid the interference of PBS signals, these
studies were performed by analyzing the interaction of TMPyP@GO in
water with each oligonucleotide in PBS, instead of having the whole
system in PBS (Raman data not shown). All spectra were normalized
with respect to the intensity of the GO G-band at 1600 cm–1 and corrected with respect to the baseline. The solid spectrum of
the free porphyrin TMPyP was also performed for comparison. Raman
mappings were performed by raster-scanning the laser beam over the
hybrid samples, acquiring a full Raman spectrum at each pixel of the
optical image and finally integrating them to generate false color
images based on the absolute area underneath specific bands at each
pixel. The images were created by the WITec software, WITec Project
2.0 with 150 × 150 points per grid in a 50 × 50 μm
area for small areas and 175 × 175 points per grid in a 175 ×
175 μm area for large areas. The vertical bar in each Raman
image corresponds to the relative color intensity of each selected
Raman band. A Hitachi H-9000 electronic microscope operating at 300
kV was employed to collect the TEM images of a drop of the aqueous
hybrid solutions when placed on a carbon-coated Cu grid and left to
dry at room temperature. The SEM and STEM images were acquired by
using a JEOL 2200FS instrument using the same sample preparation procedure.
