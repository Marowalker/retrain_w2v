We propose a simple way to create
tunable plasmonic cavities in
the infrared (IR) range using graphene films suspended upon a silicon
carbide (SiC) grating and present a numerical investigation, using
the finite element method, on the absorption properties and field
distributions of such resonant structures. We find at certain frequencies
within the SiC reststrahlen band that the structured SiC substrate
acts as a perfect reflector, providing a cavity effect by establishing
graphene plasmon standing waves. We also provide clear evidence of
strong coupling phenomena between the localized surface phonon polariton
resonances in the SiC grating with the graphene surface plasmon cavity
modes, which is revealed by a Rabi splitting in the absorption spectrum.
This paves the way to build simple plasmonic structures, using well-known
materials and experimental techniques, that can be used to excite
graphene plasmons efficiently, even at normal incidence, as well as
explore cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential applications
in IR spectroscopy.

1 Introduction
Graphene is a two-dimensional
(2D) single-atom thick layer of carbon,
and after the experimental proof of existence in 2004,1 its remarkable physical properties have led to one of the
most prolific areas of research in nanoscience. In particular, its
extreme 2D geometry and distinct band structure lead to novel interaction
with light and have resulted in immense interest from the plasmonics
and nano-optics communities.2 Doped graphene
supports collective oscillations of the free carriers known as surface
plasmon polaritons (SPPs) that can be either propagating or localized2,3 and has been recognized as a suitable alternative to noble metals
in the field of plasmonics. These plasmonic modes are characterized
by large field confinement [plasmon wavelengths, a 100 times smaller
than the free-space wavelength, have been demonstrated at mid-infrared
(IR) frequencies4] and enhancements and
are particularly appealing in graphene because of the tunability of
the Fermi energy via chemical doping or electrical gating. Optical
gaps of up to 2 eV (which corresponds to EF ≈ 1 eV) can be created.5 This
paves the way for cheap, reliable, and ultrafast optical modulators.
At terahertz and IR frequencies, graphene plasmons have been conclusively
demonstrated by a number of different experimental techniques including
scanning near-field microscopy,6−8 optical far-field spectroscopy,9 and electron energy loss spectroscopy.10

Silicon carbide (SiC) is a polar dielectric
that supports subdiffraction
confinement of light using the excitation of surface phonon polaritons
(SPhPs) that result from the coupling of a photon with the collective
oscillation of the polar lattice atoms.11 Because of the energy scale of optical phonons, the reststrahlen
band [a narrow and material-dependent frequency range bounded by the
longitudinal optical (LO) and transverse optical (TO) phonon frequencies]
inherently occurs within the IR to terahertz regime, where polar dielectrics
act as an optical metal, that is, they exhibit high reflectivity and
negative real part of the dielectric function. The long phonon lifetimes
(picoseconds), as compared to electron scattering times in metals
(10s of femtoseconds), means that the imaginary part of the dielectric
function can be orders of magnitude smaller than that for noble metals,
leading to low-loss systems with high quality factors and narrow line
widths.11 As previously shown, nanostructuring
SiC results in localized surface phonon polaritons (LSPhPs) with a
high Q and strong field confinement.12,13 SiC also has a large band gap and high thermal, mechanical, and
chemical stability, making it highly suitable for a number of applications.

In this work, we explore the coupling between SiC LSPhPs and graphene
SPPs and explore the unique properties of the hybrid modes,14 which combine positive characteristics of the
graphene SPPs (large light confinement and tunable) and SiC LSPhPs
(low loss). We consider a single-layer graphene sheet on the top of
a SiC cavity. Structuring of SiC12,13 leads to the
excitation of both the graphene SPP and a LSPhP in SiC. This is convenient
as the difficulty in nanofabrication of graphene devices, as well
as the large momentum mismatch between graphene SPPs and the incident
light, means that the creation of graphene-based resonators that can
be excited at normal incidence, is challenging. A numerical investigation,
using finite element analysis method from COMSOL Multiphysics, on
the absorption properties and field distributions of this system in
the IR range is reported. At frequencies in the reststrahlen band,
but away from the LSPhP resonances, SiC acts as a “perfect
conductor”, and at certain lengths of the grating groove, a
plasmon standing wave is set up. Here, by a perfect conductor, we
simply mean that the real part of the permittivity is extremely large
and negative (small field penetration), and we assume that SiC is
undoped and hence is not conductive. This setup is a different way
to excite localized graphene plasmons and achieve strong resonant
absorption, without using nanoribbons. Note that although we consider
the cavity as part of a periodic structure (i.e., a grating that is
convenient for experiments and numerical simulations), we do not consider
the excitation of modes using diffraction. The necessary momentum
is provided by the abrupt breaking of the symmetry of the cavity,
not by the periodicity.a

There is a lot
of interest on the coupling of surface phonons and
graphene plasmons, which becomes important at the mid-IR range for
typical polar dielectric substrates such as SiC15,16 and SiO2.6,17,18 It has also been demonstrated in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN) heterostructures4,19−22 and thin layers of surface-absorbed
polymers.23 Recently, the interaction of
localized plasmons in a gold antenna with a SiO2 coating
and the substrate has been explored, and it was found that strong
coupling between the modes leads to a transparency window.24 We find, near the LO phonon frequency, a strong
interaction between the LSPhPs and the graphene plasmons, leading
to Rabi splitting, signaling the coherent energy transfer between
the two coupled modes.25,26 The high quality factor Q and the small effective volume V of the
hybrid modes make this system a suitable system for cavity quantum
electrodynamics (QED)27 where one is interested
in the strong mixing of light and individual emitters. In photonic
cavities, the modal volume is on the order of λ3,
but by using localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and/or LSPhPs, one
can confine light fields evanescently and achieve subdiffraction modal
volume. Using hybrid modes to tailor the spectral and spatial profile
of localized plasmons to aid strong coupling to emitters has been
demonstrated.28 By picking suitable constituent
modes that have complimentary characteristics, the Q/V ratio, which is proportional to the Purcell factor,
can be increased to enhance strong light–matter interactions
with emitters. Our work provides a potential method to efficiently
excite unique hybrid modes for confining and manipulating light and
could pave the way for applications in tunable broadband molecular
spectroscopy in the terahertz and IR range.29 Furthermore, the device potentially provides a new system to study
cavity QED. The high quality factor and the small modal volume make
this system a very suitable platform for inducing and exploring strong
light–matter interactions.

2 Results
and Discussion
In Figure 1, we
show the system to be studied. It is composed of a monolayer graphene
sheet deposited on a SiC grating, and we assume that the two are in
physical contact with one another. The graphene sheet is located on
the x–z plane with the grating
period in the x direction. The incident light propagates
in the y direction from above and is normal to the
graphene surface. It is TM so that SPPs can be excited above the grating
in the graphene layer. The height, period, ridge width, and groove
width of the grating are, respectively, represented by the letters h, Λ, w, and L (see Figure 1b). The graphene
thickness in the simulations is 0.5 nm, which we have checked is converged
for all results. The cavity supporting the graphene SPPs is given
by the zone where the graphene is suspended (see Figure 1c).

grating and graphene plasmonic device. (a)

view (the incident light is transverse magnetic (TM) polarized normal
incident in the air, where Λ is the grating period, w is the width of the grating ridge, L is
the width of the grating groove, and h is the grating
height). (c) Sketch of the standing waves of graphene SPP resonance
in a grating cavity.

We model the optical properties of graphene using the local
random
phase approximation model that is known to work well.2,30 We also use the zero-temperature limit that is a good approximation
even for finite temperatures. The conductivity is given by 1  where τ is the carrier relaxation time
and is linked to the carrier mobility μ via the equation , θ denotes a step
function, and EF is the Fermi energy.
The first term describes
intraband transitions and is Drude-like. This will dominate the response
over the second term, which describes interband transitions, at the
frequencies and levels of doping we consider. In Figure 2a,b, we plot the corresponding
dielectric function for EF = 0.64 eV and
μ = 10 000 cm2/(V s) (which is a typical maximum
value for the mobility of chemical-vapor-deposition-grown graphene),
where it can be seen that graphene, for a single-layer structure,
has a remarkably large absorption at visible wavelengths.

Figure 2 Material properties
of single-layer graphene in air (a,b) and bulk
SiC (c,d). The chemical potential of graphene is EF = 0.64 eV, and carrier mobility is μ = 10 000
cm2/(V s) in all our simulations unless otherwise specified.

The dielectric function for polar
dielectrics such as SiC can be
described by a Lorentz oscillator model 2  which has a pole at the
TO phonon frequency
ωTO and a zero-crossing point at θLO. For SiC,31 ϵ∞ = 6.56, ωLO = 973 cm–1, ωTO = 797 cm–1, and γ = 4.76 cm–1; in Figure 2c,d, we show the absorption and permittivity of SiC. The SPhPs
can only be supported in a narrow spectral bandwidth (in the case
of SiC around 176 cm–1), but crucially they correspond
to frequencies at which graphene plasmons can be excited, paving the
way for interactions between the two types of excitations.

If
the momentum mismatch is overcome, graphene SPPs can be excited
by the normal incident light. Assuming that interband transitions
can be ignored, the dispersion relation for the plasmon waves in a
free-standing graphene sheet is given by30 3  where kSPP is
the in-plane wavevector of the plasmon and ϵ1 and
ϵ2 are the relative permittivity of the materials
in the infinite half-spaces above and below the graphene sheet, respectively.
The dispersion is plotted in Figure 3a for a graphene sheet in vacuum for different levels
of doping; the dispersion curve indicates that the plasmon wavelength
is on the order of 10–100 times smaller than the incident wavelength,
revealing the large confinement and the consequent momentum mismatch
that must be overcome for efficient coupling. Unless otherwise specified,
we use a Fermi energy of 0.64 eV throughout this work.

μm. The blue lines indicate a fit to a Fabry–Pérot
model for a phase shift of −π (see eq 4).

To investigate our system, we begin by calculating the absorption
of a SiC grating with no graphene sheet present. We assume that SiC
is infinitely thick below the grating to switch off the transmission
channel and simplify the analysis. We consider wavelengths and grating
periods in the range 10–14 and 1.1–5 μm, respectively,
with the grating height and the ridge width fixed at 1 μm. The
results are shown in Figure 3b. We see that within the reststrahlen band there is now a
number of peaks as compared to the plain SiC case (Figure 2c); this is due to the interaction
of the LO phonon and the grating, which leads to the excitation of
LSPhPs.13 There is a region of large absorption
at the LSPhP resonances, but elsewhere in the band the absorption
is close to 0% as SiC acts as a perfect reflector. Outside of the
reststrahlen band, for frequencies less than ωLO and
larger than ωTO, the absorption is very similar to
that for a plain SiC surface shown in Figure 2c.

Next, we add graphene on the top
of the grating, with the results
shown in Figure 3c,d.
We consider two quantities: PabsT, which represents the total
absorption (sum of the absorption of the SiC grating and the graphene
layer), and PabsG, which is the absorption in the graphene.
The most striking difference is the appearance of strong absorption
peaks in the low absorption region of the reststrahlen band for certain
grating period lengths. This can be understood by looking at the near
field of the y component of the electric field for each peak, as shown
in Figure 4a. The field
is concentrated in the graphene layer and has a fixed number of wavelengths
in the region directly over air. The plasmon modes are antisymmetric,
which is a consequence of the electric field boundary conditions.
The normal incident field excites SPPs at the edge, which are out
of phase and will only constructively interfere for odd modes.32 In the parts of the graphene, which are located
on the top of SiC, there exists a very weak field and consequently
there is low absorption in these locations. This can be understood
by noting in this spectral region that SiC acts, to a good approximation,
as a perfect electrical conductor and screens out any external field
very effectively. In other words, the field is zero outside of the
cavity region and leads to plasmon standing waves being established.
To confirm this, in Figure 4a, we show the absorption varying with the cavity length (for
a fixed wavelength λ = 12 μm). We find, at integer multiples
of L/λSPP, absorption peaks that
correspond to the plasmon standing waves. This is shown pictorially
in Figure 1c. For non-normal
incident light, it is also possible to excite symmetric plasmon standing
waves as the symmetry of the system is broken. Note that there is
also a small peak located near L/λSPP = 0, which is a LSPhP mode that is visible without graphene (see Figure 3b); it is present
for small cavities because of near-field coupling between the two
SiC slabs. Our findings have some similarities with earlier work on
the plasmonic coupling between graphene SPPs and magnetic polaritons
in silver gratings.33 Note that the cavities
used in that work are very deep (a width of 300 nm and a height of
2 μm) as compared to that of our system, where the cavity height
and the width studied are always equal or comparable, which makes
the experimental realization potentially much simpler. The highest
field enhancement in our system is located on the graphene layer,
which is very convenient for potential applications in molecular sensors.
Note that the fact that the peak position does not change for varying
Λ (for a fixed cavity length) is a confirmation that these are
localized cavity modes and are not modes excited by diffraction effects
owing to the grating periodicity.34 In
an experiment, it would be more natural to explore these standing
wave modes by scanning the excitation light wavelength for fixed geometric
parameters; in Figure 4b, we show this for various chemical potentials for L = 1.06 μm, w = 2.0 μm, and h = 1 μm. We find that as the Fermi energy is increased
the absorption peak red shifts (as the SPP wavelength changes with EF) and grows in intensity. This illustrates
that our system can act as a tunable cavity, thanks to the inclusion
of the graphene sheet. In Figure 4c, we show how the grating height impacts the absorption
of graphene; we find that the absorption intensity is strongly dependent
on the height. When the height is changed, the graphene SPP wavelength
does not change; this is because when h is large
(h > 500 nm here), then eq 3 applies and λSPP depends
only on the material directly above and below the suspended graphene
(in this case, air).

Figure 4 (a) Absorption of the graphene layer at different geometric
parameters L/λSPP of the SiC grating.
The peaks at
integer numbers of L/λSPP correspond
to the standing waves of the graphene SPPs as indicated by the above
near-field plot of Ey for each peak. The
electric field (here, normalized to the incident field magnitude)
goes to zero at the boundaries, meaning that the plasmon modes must
be antisymmetric. (b) Absorption of the graphene layer against excitation
wavelength for fixed geometric parameters: L = 1.06
μm, w = 2.0 μm, and h = 1 μm (shown for different Fermi energies). (c) Absorption
of the graphene layer at different geometric parameters for different
grating heights h and EF = 0.64 eV.

To confirm our intuition
about these standing wave modes, we use
the graphene dispersion in eq 3 along with a Fabry–Pérot model 4  where δϕ is the phase
shift. Taking
a phase shift of −π, we find a good agreement with the
simulation results (see the blue lines in Figure 3d) in the region near the TO energy where
the grating acts as a perfect electric conductor (i.e., plasmon standing
waves in the cavity). At frequencies away from this, the simple model
breaks down as the phase shift is frequency-dependent and will differ
from −π. This is due to the grating not acting as a perfect
reflector any more and allowing some field penetration into the SiC.
To quantify the suitability of the cavity as an experimental system
for strong light–matter interactions, we consider the ratio Q/V. To calculate the volume, we consider
a square cavity (with sides of length L, we use w = 1 μm and L is calculated using
a period Λ that sets up a plasmon standing wave) with a plasmon
standing wave setup in both directions; the dimension perpendicular
to the graphene sheet is given by the out-of-plane decay of the plasmon: [kSPP(ω)]35 (as kSPP ≫
2π/λ, then kz ≈ ikSPP, and for 12 μm incident wavelength,
this distance corresponds to 0.17 μm). The quality factor can
be estimated using the equation Q ≈ ω/Δω,
where we obtain the line width Δω using a Lorentzian fit.
At a wavelength of 12 μm, we find a value of Q/V = 8 × 105/λ03, which is comparable to the values found for other graphene
nanoresonators.4

Another interesting
feature, revealed in Figure 3d (and a zoom-in is provided in Figure 5a,b), is the presence
of an anticrossing point in the absorption spectrum close to the LO
phonon frequency; this is a manifestation of strong coupling between
the two modes, the graphene plasmon and a localized cavity SPhP,13 and can be intuitively understood by considering
two coupled harmonic oscillators.26 The
shape of the Rabi splitting shown in Figure 5a,b is a consequence of the dispersive graphene
SPP (given by eq 4) and
the LSPhP at a fixed wavelength of 10.6 μm. The strong coupling
regime is very dependent on the level of the damping of the system;
thus, the small line widths of graphene plasmons and SiC SPhPs are
favorable for the observation of Rabi splitting. It should be noted
that at frequencies close to the LO phonon energy graphene SPPs can
become lossy because of substrate phonons.4 In our cavity-grating system, a substantial amount of the graphene
is free-standing and not in contact with the substrate, which should
negate this.

Figure 5 (a) Zoom-in of the absorption in the graphene layers (for w = h = 1 μm) shown in Figure 3d between the wavelengths 10.2
and 10.8 μm, highlighting the Rabi splitting for different modes.
(b) Zoom-in for m = 2 mode (the purple dashed line
indicates the LSPhP wavelength and the cyan dashed line shows the
graphene SPP dispersion using the Fabry–Pérot model
with a phase shift of −1.35π). The blue line shows the
resulting splitting of the hybrid mode.

In Figure 6, we
show a slice of the absorption in the graphene, apply a sum of two
Lorentzian functions to fit the curve, and quantify the strength of
the coupling. We find the peak separation (i.e., the Rabi splitting)
to be ωR = 1 meV. This value can then be used with
a coupled harmonic oscillator model to describe the anticrossing36 5  where we take the LSPhP energy to be fixed
at a value of 0.12 eV, the graphene SPP dispersion is given by eqs 3 and 4, and we use the phase shift as a fitting parameter as it can no
longer be expected to be −π at these wavelengths. The
result for the fit to the m = 2 mode is shown in Figure 5b, where a good fit
is obtained using a phase shift of δϕ = −1.35π;
this indicates that at these frequencies SiC does not act as a perfect
reflector.

Figure 6 Spectra shown correspond to L = 1.45 μm,
which means that Λ = 2.45 μm. The summation of two Lorentz
equations is used to fit these peaks. The full widths at half maximum
of these two peaks are 0.004 rad/μm (W1) and 0.005 rad/μm (W2).
The peak distance is D = 0.005 rad/μm. The
ratio D/W = 1 quantifies the strength
of the coupling and shows that this is the strong coupling regime.

Also shown in Figure 6 are two near-field plots showing
the different nature of the hybrid
mode depending on the frequency; at lower frequencies, the mode is
more phonon-polariton-like and the absorption is situated at the bottom
of the cavity. At larger frequencies, the mode is more graphene-plasmon-like
and the absorption is concentrated in the graphene layer on the top.
Thus, over small frequency range, one has a lot of spatial control
of where absorption takes place in this system, which is a consequence
of strong coupling between the modes. Further control of the relative
contribution of each mode is given by the cavity width and the doping
level. To quantify the coupling, we compare the line width of the
constituent modes (W1 and W2) to the splitting (D), for Rabi splitting
to be experimentally observable D ≳ W.26 Taking the largest line
width, we get the ratio of D/W =
1, which justifies considering this interaction of the two modes as
strong coupling.

3 Conclusions
We have
studied a graphene and SiC cavity system and have shown
its suitability as an experimentally realizable, tunable cavity that
could be useful for cavity QED and molecular sensing in the mid-IR
range. We have shown that the inclusion of a graphene monolayer on
a SiC grating leads to a number of new modes in the low absorption
part of the reststrahlen band. These modes can be explained as antisymmetric
plasmon standing waves, set up by the SiC grating that acts as a perfect
conductor at certain frequencies, which are well-explained by a simple Fabry–Pérot model.
By altering the chemical potential of the graphene or changing the
cavity width, one can change the spectral position of these peaks,
meaning the system acts as a very tunable plasmonic cavity. Near the
LO phonon energy, we find evidence of strong coupling between the
graphene SPP and the LSPhP, leading to a hybrid mode14 that exhibits characteristics of both constituent modes.
Our results also offer promise that a similar coupling with local
trace level quantities of molecules could be possible. We find that
over a small frequency range the spatial profile of the hybrid modes
can change significantly. The tunability, high quality factor, and
low modal volume make this system an ideal setup for molecular sensing
and to study cavity QED.

explore are not reproduced by the equation , where N is the diffraction
order and Λ is the grating period. We consider a grating because
it simplifies the calculation, but similar results would be obtained
