A facile method for reduction of
textile effluents (TEff) using
fluorescent nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) has been developed
and reported here. The synthesis of N-CDs was done by a hydrothermal
carbonization method using the aqueous extract of Phyllanthus
emblica (P. emblica) fruit as a carbon source and aq NH3 as a nitrogen dopant.
Various analytical techniques have been employed for the characterization
of N-CDs. The size of the synthesized N-CDs was found to be 4.08 nm,
which was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
analysis. The graphitic character of the N-CDs was studied by using
selected area energy diffraction pattern and Raman spectroscopy studies.
Under the excitation of 320 nm, an intense blue fluorescence was emitted
by N-CDs of around 400 nm. From the obtained results of energy-dispersive
spectrometry, EDAX, and Fourier transform infrared studies, it was
confirmed that nitrogen was doped over the N-CD surface. Finally,
the catalytic ability of NaBH4 was found to be enhanced
remarkably by the synthesized CDs in the detoxification of TEff.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
earlier days, semiconductor quantum dots have invited the attention
of scientists because of their remarkable luminescent and electronic
properties. Because the preparation of semiconductor quantum dots
usually involves heavy metals, which are very harmful to both human
beings and environment even at low levels, their applications in the
field of biomedicine are very much limited.1 This has prompted the researchers to search for biocompatible quantum
dots in preference to semiconductor quantum dots. In general, carbon
dots (CDs) are highly fluorescent novel carbon nanomaterials having
a diameter between 1 and 10 nm , which mainly consists of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms.2−4 These fluorescent CDs have been
generally utilized in various applications because of their fundamental
merits such as low toxicity, good biosafety, high water solubility,
high chemical inactiveness, and easy functionalization.5,6 Owing to the superior properties of CDs, they have greater applications
in various fields over the conventional semiconductor quantum dots.7

The doping of N, P, and S on CDs has been
found to significantly
improve the fundamental properties of CDs such as optical and electronic,
fluorescent behavior, surface modification, and chemical activity
because of the extra electrons present in the heteroatom.8,9 CDs have been widely used in multidisciplinary research fields such
as catalysis, drug delivery, optoelectronics, bioimaging, gene delivery,
biosensing, metal ion sensing, energy storage devices, and photovoltaics.2−15 Though there has been rapid progress in the field of CDs, their
synthesis is quite difficult because of complicated reaction conditions,
harmful starting materials, and steps involved in surface passivation.16

Nowadays, natural and renewable green
sources are used as precursors
for the synthesis of CDs because they are inexpensive, clean, nontoxic,
and easily accessible.17 For the synthesis
of CDs, some of the reported natural carbon precursors are soya beans,
orange juice, gas soot, grass, watermelon peel, pomelo peel, ginger,
and honey.18 The CDs prepared from these
sources are fluorescent in nature. The particle size, choice of dopant,
effect of the passivating agent, pH, time, temperature, and nature
of the solvent, etc., play a vital role in influencing the fluorescent
behavior of the CDs. The fluorescence ability and catalytic behavior
of the CDs has been significantly improved when electron-rich heteroatoms
such as nitrogen, boron, and sulfur are doped over the surface of
the CDs.19 Moreover, the synthesized CDs
can be utilized as effective fluorescent probes for sensing, catalysis,
and biological applications.20

It
is well-known that textile industries release huge quantities
of textile effluents (TEff) containing a variety of dyes and chemicals
that harm both human and ecosystems when effluents get mixed into
rivers and other water bodies.21,22 In recent years, treatment
of TEff and other environmental pollutants has become a major challenge
worldwide. At present, to overcome this problem, appropriate strategies
are being advocated involving the use of chemicals as reducing agents.23 In the present work, the catalytic ability of
the biogenic nitrogen-doped CDs (N-CDs) is utilized for the detoxification
of TEff.

Indian gooseberry or amla is botanically identified
as Phyllanthus emblica, and it belongs
to the Phyllanthaceae
family of flowering plants. The amla fruit is quite fibrous and has
sour and bitter taste. The phytochemical constituents of the fruit
include two hydrolysable tannins Emblicanin A and B, phyllemblin,
corilagin, furosin, geraniin, quercetin, phyllantine and phyllantidine,
amino acids, and carbohydrates. The juice of the fruit contains high
concentration of vitamin C.24 Further,
it contains a high quantity of valuable nutrients such as iron phosphorus,
sodium, calcium, proteins, vitamin B complex, carbohydrates, cholesterol,
and carotene.25 In India, amla is commonly
used as a diuretic, laxative, liver tonic, refrigerant, restorative,
an antipyretic, hair tonic, an ulcer preventive, and for the treatment
of common cold, alone or in combination with other plants.26

In the present study, P.
emblica is used as a source of carbon, and for the
nitrogen doping, aq NH3 has been used for the synthesis
of N-CDs by an easy one-pot
hydrothermal carbonization method without adding any surface passivating
agent. In order to improve the photophysical property of CDs, aq NH3 was introduced as a nitrogen source in the acidic medium.
The resultant N-CDs were carefully examined with the help of various
analytical techniques such as UV–visible and fluorescence spectroscopy,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), selected
area energy dispersion (SAED), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. UV–visible
spectroscopy was used to monitor the catalytic ability of the hydrothermally
obtained N-CDs in the detoxification of TEff using NaBH4.

2 Results and Discussion
The green hydrothermal
carbonization of P. emblica extract
has resulted in the color transformation from pale green
to blackish brown, which indicated the formation of N-CDs.

2.1 Optical Properties of N-CDs
UV–vis
spectroscopy is the most valuable technique for analyzing the optical
characters of CDs, and it is reciprocal to fluorescence spectroscopy.27Figure 1a shows the UV–vis spectra of the P.
emblica fruit extract and obtained N-CDs in aqueous
medium. The extract of P. emblica fruit
showed the absorption maxima at 275 nm in the UV region, and the N-CDs
exhibit two major absorption maxima at 271 and 317 nm, corresponding
to the π–π* transition of C=C (sp2) bonds and the n−π* transition of the nitrogen or carbonyl
group, respectively.27 The excitation spectrum
of N-CDs (Figure 1b)
showed a photoluminescence (PL) excitation peak at 317 nm, which corroborates
to the absorption spectrum (Figure 1a). The prepared N-CDs were transparent in daylight
and exhibited blue luminescence under UV illumination at 365 nm (Figure 1a inset).

Figure 1 (a) Absorption
spectra of the P. emblica extract and
N-CDs and (b) corresponding PL excitation spectrum of
N-CDs.

Figure 2 displays
the PL emission spectra of the prepared N-CDs at various excitation
wavelengths. The PL emission intensity of the N-CDs depends strongly
on excitation wavelengths. On the variation of the excitation wavelength
from 270 to 320 nm (Figure 2a), the PL intensity gradually increased owing to the π
to π* transitions of graphitic carbon cores of the N-CDs. In Figure 2b, there was a gradual
decrease in the emission peak intensity when the excitation wavelength
was varied from 320 to 400 nm and the PL emission peaks showed a bathochromic
shift. The maximum intensity was observed at 400 nm under the excitation
of 320 nm. Thus, the PL emission spectra of the prepared N-CDs appeared
because of the radiative recombination of nitrogen moieties (or) carbonyl
functional groups present on the N-CD surface.28 The quantum yield was calculated by a relative fluorescence
method, which was found to be 0.34 for undoped CDs and 0.41 for N-CDs.
The zeta potential was found to be −0.27 for N-CDs and −3.23
for undoped CDs.

(a) from 270 to 320 nm; and (b) from 320 to 400 nm.

2.2 Surface Morphology
Figure 3a shows the
HR-TEM images of
the N-CDs at the scale range of 20 nm. The green synthesized N-CDs
were found to be spread evenly on the copper grid and were spherical
in nature. The average diameter of N-CDs was 4.08 nm with size ranging
from 1 to 10 nm (Figure 3b). The HR-TEM image in Figure 3c visibly displays the lattice fringes, which evidently
confirmed the graphitic nature of the N-CD.29 The calculated d-spacing value was approximately
0.27 nm, which revealed the C(100) plane in graphitic carbon.30 The diffused disk pattern in the SAED of N-CDs
(Figure 3d) confirmed
the amorphous nature of carbon.31

of N-CDs (a) at the 20 nm scale; (b) particle size
graph; (c) HR-TEM image of N-CDs at the 2 nm scale; and (d) SAED outline
for N-CDs.

The EDS technique provides supportive
information to the HR-TEM
analysis and furnishes exact details on the elements present in the
N-CDs.32 The EDAX spectrum from the scanning
electron microscopy analysis served as evidence for the elements present
in the N-CDs. The EDS (Figure 4) and EDAX (Figure 5) spectra of the synthesized N-CDs mostly contain C (73.45%),
N (8.65%), and O (17.90%).33

spectrum of N-CDs.

2.3 Structural
Analysis
Figure 6 displays the FT-IR spectra
of the P. emblica fruit extract and
synthesized N-CDs. It can be observed that the P. emblica extract shows broad absorption bands at 3414, 2856, 1707, and 1341
cm–1 that correspond to the stretching frequency
of −OH, −C–H, −C=O, and −C–O–C
functional groups, respectively. The IR spectrum of N-CDs had absorption
bands at 3426, 2928, 1629, and 1047 cm–1, which
could be assigned to the stretching frequency of −OH/–NH,
−CH, −C=C (sp2), and −C–N
(N doping) functional groups, respectively.34,35 These results confirmed that the synthesized N-CDs consists of acid,
hydroxyl, amine, amide, and carbonyl moieties.

and P. emblica fruit extract.

Figure 7 provides
the XRD pattern for the synthesized N-CDs. The intense broad peak
appeared at 2θ = 28.5° and a weak peak appeared at 2θ
= 40.6°, which were assigned to the (002) plane and (100) plane
of graphitic carbon, respectively.36 Bragg’s
equation (eq 1) was used
to calculate the interlayer distance (d-spacing)
value for the synthesized N-CDs. 1  where λ is the
wavelength of incident
X-ray (λ = 1.54 Å), n is a positive integer,
and θ is the position of the plane. Because of the tiny-sized
N-CDs, the XRD peak was broadened. The calculated interlayer distance
(d-spacing) value of synthesized N-CDs was 0.319
and 0.277 nm, which corresponds to the C(002) and C(100) peaks, respectively.

of N-CDs.

Raman spectroscopy is one of the
most important techniques for
characterizing carbon-based materials. Figure 8 displays the Raman spectrum for the green
synthesized N-CDs. This spectrum showed two dissimilar bands at 1384
and 1610 cm–1, which indicate the presence of the
D band and G bands in the synthesized N-CDs, which correspond to the
sp3 defects and sp2 carbon, respectively.32 The Raman spectroscopic results noticeably confirmed
the minimum surface defects with moderate graphitic structure.37

Figure 8 Raman spectrum for synthesized N-CDs.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is the most useful
tool,
and it provides elemental identity and also the exact quantity of
the elements present in the CDs. Figure 9 displays the overall XPS spectrum of the
synthesized N-CDs and its deconvoluted XPS spectra for C (1s), N (1s),
and O (1s) elements. In Figure 9a, the elemental carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen peaks appeared
at 282.8, 397.8, and 529.4 eV, respectively. Figure 9b displays the deconvolution spectrum of
C 1s, which shows three peaks at 283.1, 284.9, and 290.9 eV, and they
are ascribed to C–H, C=C (sp2), and π–π*
transitions, respectively.38−40 In particular, one of the C 1s
peaks at 284.9 eV indicated that the synthesized N-CDs were mostly
constructed by sp2 carbon atoms.36,41 Next, Figure 9c shows
the high-resolution deconvolution spectrum of N 1s, which appeared
as two peaks at 397.8 and 399.1 eV, which may possibly be ascribed
to amide (O=C–NH2) and amine (C–NH2) groups on the N-CDs surface, respectively.36,41 Finally, Figure 9d shows the deconvolution spectrum of O 1s, which exhibits two binding
energy peaks at 529.7 and 531.03 eV, which correspond to the C–O–C
and −C–O/–N–O groups, respectively.37,39 The XPS results noticeably exposed that carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen
were present in the synthesized N-CDs and their atomic percentages
(%) were 73.8, 8.7, and 17.5, respectively, which confirmed that nitrogen
was doped on the surface of the CDs.27,36 From the above
discussion, it can be concluded that the synthesized N-CDs have hydroxyl,
amine, amide, and carboxyl functional groups, which supported the
results of FT-IR spectroscopy and HR-TEM with EDS analysis.36,37,39

(d) O 1s.

2.4 Mechanism
for Formation of N-CDs
The formation of N-CDs has been reported
to be taking place through
four steps: polymerization, aromatization, nucleation, and growth
process.21 The extract of P. emblica and aqueous ammonia on heating to about
100 °C forms bigger sized polymeric particles in the first step
because of inter- and intramolecular dehydration. In the next step,
while increasing the temperature, the aromatization of the bigger
sized polymeric molecules takes place. In the third step, the nucleation
burst between the aromatized molecules could lead finally to the formation
of N-CDs.36,42

2.5 Catalytic Ability of N-CDs
in the Detoxification
of TEff Using NaBH4
The detoxification of TEff
using NaBH4 in the presence of N-CDs was followed using
UV–visible spectroscopy. The λmax values for
the dyes present in TEff were 601, 392, and 302 nm. Figure 10a shows the detoxification of TEff using NaBH4 in the absence
of synthesized N-CDs. The intensity of TEff slightly decreased after
the addition of NaBH4. There was only a slight decrease
in the intensity of TEff on increase of time. Even after 2 h, no significant
reduction of TEff could be observed. Figure 10b displays the UV–visible spectra
of the detoxification of TEff using NaBH4 in the presence
of synthesized N-CDs (green catalyst) and Figure 10c is the inset of Figure 10b that clearly shows the degradation of
pigments. After the addition of 10 μL of green catalyst (0.2
wt/vol %) to the reaction mixture containing TEff and NaBH4, the intensity of TEff decreased markedly and the reduction reaction
was completed in 12 min. The TEff absorption peaks disappeared upon
addition of N-CDs, which confirmed the superior catalytic ability
of the N-CDs in the degradation of dyes present in TEff. The absorption
maximum of synthesized N-CDs at 271 nm (Figure 11b) indicated that the green catalyst remained
unchanged even after the completion of the reduction reaction.

using NaBH4 (a) in the absence of N-CDs and (b) in the
presence of N-CDs and (c) inset of Figure 11b.

Figure 11 Graphical representation of the mechanism of formation of N-CDs.

The reduction of mixture of dyes
present in the TEff by the N-CDs
can be explained with the help of Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.33 The BH4– and dyes
get adsorbed over the biogenic N-CDs. The electronic reaction between
BH4– and dyes is probably facilitated
through electron transfer via N-CDs, which lowers the energy barrier
between the reactant and product. This could lead to the increased
rate of degradation of pigments in the effluents.9,43,44 Thus, the results of the study explicitly
state that N-CDs act as a superior catalyst in the detoxification
of TEff by NaBH4 (Figure 12).45

of TEff using N-CDs.

3 Conclusions
The present study outlines
the successful strategy of production
of N-CDs from the P. emblica fruit
extract through a one-pot hydrothermal carbonization process. The
HR-TEM image exhibits the spherical nature of the synthesized N-CDs
with an average size of 4.08 nm. The XRD pattern and Raman spectroscopic
results confirmed the graphitic nature of the synthesized N-CDs. The
N-CDs emitted an intense blue color at 365 nm. The FT-IR and EDS spectroscopy
results confirmed the doping of nitrogen on the surface of the N-CDs.
The synthesized N-CDs showed considerable catalytic ability on the
reduction of TEff by NaBH4 when monitored spectroscopically.

Thus, the study has brought to light a successful strategy of detoxification
of TEff from textile industries by employing biogenically prepared
N-CDs as revealed by the real-time test results.

4 Experimental
Methods
4.1 Materials and Chemicals
The P. emblica (amla) fruits were acquired from the local
market in Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India. Aqueous ammonia, sodium borohydride,
and quinine sulfate were procured from CDH Fine Chemicals. TEff were
collected from a dyeing unit at Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, India, prior
to the treatment processes. For the preparation of solutions, conductivity
water was used.

4.2 P. emblica Fruit
Extract Preparation
About 50 g of P. emblica fruit was thoroughly washed in running water, carefully cut into
small pieces, and crushed well mechanically. The prepared amla extract
was first filtered by filtration with the help of cotton and then
using a Whatmann 40 filter paper. The resultant P.
emblica fruit extract was utilized as the biogenic
source for the preparation of N-CDs.

4.3 Synthesis
of N-CDs
A simple, one-pot
hydrothermal carbonization process was used for the preparation of
N-CDs from P. emblica extract. In this
process, the mixture of 29 mL of the P. emblica extract and 1 mL of aq NH3 was taken in a stainless steel
autoclave containing a 50 mL Teflon lin. The autoclave was kept in
a hot air oven for 12 h at 180 °C. After the completion of reaction,
the autoclave was allowed to cool at 25 °C. After reaching room
temperature, the autoclave was carefully opened and the extract was
filtered through a Whatmann 40 filter paper and centrifuged for 1
h at 10 000 rpm. The resultant dark brown solution containing
N-CDs was collected and carefully stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C
for further studies.

4.4 Characterization Methods
A Jasco
FP 8500 PL spectrophotometer was used to analyze the optical properties
of the resultant N-CDs. In the fluorescence spectrophotometer, the
excitation wavelengths from 270 to 400 nm were used to find the maximum
luminescence intensity. A PerkinElmer LAMBDA 35 UV–visible
spectrophotometer was used to characterize the N-CDs on the basis
of absorption maxima. The morphology and microstructures were examined
by using a JOEL JEM 2100 electron microscope with an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. In HR-TEM studies, the samples were prepared by
placing an aqueous solution containing CDs over the copper grid and
dried at ambient temperature. A Jasco FT-IR 460 Plus spectrophotometer
was employed to analyze the dried P. emblica extract and synthesized N-CDs. A PANalytical X’Pert diffractometer
was utilized for recording the XRD pattern of N-CDs. STR 500 nm focal
length laser Raman spectroscopy was employed for obtaining Raman spectra
for the synthesized N-CDs. A DelsaNano C particle analyzer was used
to measure the zeta potential of the N-CDs. Simultaneously, the undoped
CDs were also prepared and characterized using the above methods (results
are given in as Supporting Information).

4.5 Assessment of the Catalytic Ability of N-CDs
The catalytic performance of the synthesized N-CDs was examined
using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. The untreated TEff was
collected from a dyeing unit at Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, India, which
contained a mixture of dyes such as yellow RD, navy CN, and black
SGR. The quartz cuvette having 3.5 mL capacity with a path length
of 1 cm was used to carry out the catalytic reduction of the TEff.
Trial experiments were performed to determine the optimum parameters
for the reduction of green synthesized N-CDs. TEff (1 mL) was mixed
with 1.80 mL of water and 0.20 mL of NaBH4 (0.50 M) with
and without N-CDs [10 μL(0.2 wt/vol %)], and the reduction of
TEff was monitored using a UV–visible spectrophotometer at
various intervals of time from 200 to 800 nm.
