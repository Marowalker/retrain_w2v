Despite
significant interest in molecular gels due to their intriguing
structure formation through self-assembly and their stimuli-responsive
behavior, our understanding of the gel formation mechanism of a low-molecular-weight
gelator (LMWG) is incomplete. Here, we report a combined experimental
and computational study on a LMWG, di-Fmoc-l-lysine, that
has two aromatic moieties and multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.
Gelation in various organic solvent–water mixtures was obtained
through the solvent-triggered technique. We show that an approach
based on approximate cohesive energy density derived from density
functional theory (DFT) calculations can capture the experimental
solubility trend of LMWGs in different organic solvents. Furthermore,
DFT calculations indicate parallel and helical structures to be the
preferred structural motifs for gelator dimers. We believe that these
motifs can potentially lead to fiber formation as observed with microscopy.
Our work provides a relatively simple yet effective approach to quantify
interactions between solvents and complex gelators that can help rationalize
solubility and gelation behavior.

Introduction
Molecular gels have
received significant attention as their stimuli-responsive
behavior makes them attractive for numerous applications, including
drug delivery, tissue engineering, and nanostructured materials.1−6 In these systems, low-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) are dissolved
in a solvent and gelation is triggered by external stimuli such as
temperature,7 ultraviolet light,8 salt,9 and pH10,11 or by changing the solubility of gelators through addition of poor
solvents.12,13 The LMWGs often consist of multiple chemical
moieties that manifest different intermolecular interactions between
gelator molecules and between gelators and the surrounding media.
The interactions (∼kBT) can be in the form of hydrogen bonding, dispersion, and π–π
interactions.3,14,15 These relatively weak interactions make the gelation process and
gel properties dynamic and complex.16,17

The
solvent-triggered method is a common method to induce gelation
for different aromatic peptide amphiphiles.13,18−21 In this approach, LWMGs are dissolved in good solvents to obtain
a homogeneous solution within a few minutes and then another liquid
is added to the solution to trigger gelation. The second liquid is
a poor solvent for the gelator but is completely miscible with the
first solvent. Using this approach, gelation of Fmoc-peptide gelator
molecules in organic solvent–water mixtures has been reported,
for example, gelation of Fmoc–leucine–glycine,18 Fmoc–phenylalanine derivatives,19 Fmoc–diphenylalanine,13,20 and Fmoc–asparagine21 in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)–water. In these systems, parallel and antiparallel
stacking of Fmoc moieties result in self-assembled fibrils, ribbons,
or other structures.3,14 The self-assembly process becomes
more complex if additional aromatic moieties are present,10,14,22−25 such as in di-Fmoc-l-lysine in which two Fmoc moieties exist at the two ends of the gelator
molecule. This gelator molecule has shown to form gels,11 but many possible combinations of stacking can
be anticipated, and such a self-assembly process cannot be completely
elucidated using a phenomenological approach.

In addition to
hydrophobic Fmoc moieties, the gelator molecules
consist of many functional groups. Interactions between these functional
groups and the solution media play an important role in the self-assembly
process; however, our understanding on the gel formation mechanism
of LWMGs in a particular medium is incomplete.2,26−28 The most widely used approach, based on the Hansen
solubility parameters (HSPs),26,27,29−33 classifies gelators and solvents depending upon the difference between
the respective HSP components, namely, dispersion, polar, and hydrogen
bonding. In some instances, HSPs were shown to correlate (or partially
correlate) with the gelation behavior of a gelator in a particular
solvent.26,27,29−33 Such correlation mostly involves only one of the HSP components,
but the other components do not follow any trend.27 For instance, 12-hydroxystearic acid (HSA) gelation behavior
correlates with the hydrogen bonding component, δH-bond, of HSPs.27 HSA forms
gels in solvents with low δH-bond but remains
in solution with high δH-bond.34 However, this approach is not suitable for many
cases such as ALS gelators (consisting of aromatic groups other than
Fmoc, linkers, and steroidal groups), where gelation does not correlate
with any of the HSP components.27

Computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT),35−37 molecular dynamics,38−44 and Monte Carlo40,45 have been used to study the self-assembly
of gelators, the preferred geometry of gelators in the gel state,
and a priori prediction of gelation.38,46,47 The ability to predict or to correlate solubility
or gelation with the solubility parameter approach rests on the applicability
of geometric mixing rules for solvent–gelator interactions.48,49 Given the difficulty in determining the accurate solubility parameters
of complex molecules, especially of gelator molecules that are yet
to be synthesized, exploring the utility of DFT calculations to approximate
cohesive energy density (CED) is appealing.

The experimental
and computation studies in tandem can provide
a better understanding of the gel formation mechanism of LMWGs. Toward
this goal, we consider the gelation of a LMWG, di-Fmoc-l-lysine
or Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH, in an organic solvent–water mixture.
We used the solvent-triggered technique for gelation, in comparison
to the earlier report of gelation of this molecule in different pH
buffers.11 The computational approach involves
determining the binding energy of organic solvents at selected sites
of the gelator molecule. The solubility trend obtained from the computational
study correlates with the experimental observation of gelation after
addition of water in the gelator solution.

The di-Fmoc-l-lysine molecule has a unique molecular structure
(Figure 1), as it has
two Fmoc end moieties and multiple functional groups capable of hydrogen
bonding. The Fmoc moieties of di-Fmoc-l-lysine can interact
with the Fmoc moieties of other gelator molecules through π–π
interactions, and various configurations are possible, for example,
parallel and antiparallel stacking,14 but
the most favorable configuration has not been determined. Also, two
large aromatic end-groups with dihedral flexibility and the presence
of multiple hydrogen bond acceptor and donor groups result in complex
interactions that are difficult to predict using the phenomenological
approach. DFT calculations presented here provide energetics associated
with stacking of two gelator molecules leading to fibrillar and branched
structure formation, as observed from microscopy.

Results and Discussion
Gel Preparation and Characterization
Gels were prepared
using the solvent-triggered approach (Figure 1a),13,18−21 where the gelator was dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent,
followed by addition of water. We chose organic solvents with varying
polarity and hydrogen bonding capability, such as methanol, ethanol,
1-propanol, DMSO, and dimethylformamide (DMF) (hereby referred as
solvents). Water is miscible with the organic solvents but is a poor
solvent for the gelator. Dissolving the gelator in the organic solvents
resulted in transparent solutions. The solution became opaque with
addition of water but turned into a transparent gel after some time.
Sequential addition of a solvent and nonsolvent is important for our
case, as addition of gelator in a binary mixture of an organic solvent
and water did not result into gel formation. Most of the results presented
here are for gelator concentrations of 1.7 and 3.4 mM (equivalent
to 1 and 2 mg/mL, respectively). The volume fraction of the solvent
(ϕsolvent) in the final solution was maintained as
0.20 or 0.26. The gelator dissolves in DMF, DMSO, and acetone easily,
within few minutes and without any external mixing. However, heating
and mixing were required to dissolve the gelator in methanol, 1-propanol,
and ethanol (see Table 1). Also, the gelation time depends on the solvent; for example, 1-propanol–,
DMF–, and acetone–water systems have the fastest gelation
time, on the order of 2 h, whereas it took about 2 days in methanol.
We also note that gels in methanol–water systems were not very
stable, as precipitation of the gelator was observed after about 7
days.

Figure 1b displays
the images of the gel samples in different solvents, 72 h after addition
of water, as tested by the vial inversion test. We have also attempted
to obtain a phase/morphology diagram for these gels.50−52 The results for three solvents, 1-propanol, acetone, and DMF, are
shown in Figure S1. For the 1-propanol
and DMF samples, we considered the maximum temperature of 80 °C,
whereas for acetone samples, the maximum temperature was 60 °C,
near the boiling point of acetone. Phase transition was investigated,
through visual observation and the vial inversion test, at every 10
°C interval by heating the samples in an oven. For every temperature,
we have waited at least 60 min so that the samples can reach a thermal
equilibrium. At low concentration, less than about 0.5 mg/mL, a low-viscosity
solution was observed. At room temperature, with increasing gelator
concentration, the low-viscosity solution became a viscous solution,
similar to that reported by Gao et al.50 This is followed by gel formation beyond the gelator concentration
of about 0.8 mg/mL. With increasing temperature, the gel samples maintained
their structural integrity up to a certain temperature, but with a
further increase of temperature, the samples started to melt and the
samples consisted of two phases, a block of gel in a viscous solution
(see Figure S1). With further increase
of temperature, the 2-phase samples melted to become fluid. The sol–gel
transition temperature in our system does not show a significant concentration
dependence.51 Gelation of small-molecule
gelators has been described as a “crystalline assembly”
process, a kinetically controlled process.28,53 Interestingly, the melting behavior of our gel has shown some resemblance
to the melting of a semicrystalline polymer with broad melting transition.

Gel formation was further evaluated using shear rheology. Here,
the evolution of dynamic moduli, G′ (storage
modulus) and G″ (loss modulus), was tracked
as a function of time.54 As displayed in Figure 2a, for a gel in DMF–water, G′ and G″ increased with
time and reached a plateau after about 120 min. At that stage, G′ was about an order of magnitude higher than G″, confirming the formation of a gel (soft-solid)-like
material. The gel also displays an almost frequency-independent behavior
(Figure 2b). Figure 2c displays changes
in G′ and G″ as a
function of strain as obtained from the strain-sweep experiments.
Some of these gels display a strain-softening behavior at a relatively
low strain amplitude, for example, softening of a gel in DMF–water
starts at approximately 0.3% strain amplitude. It is important to
note that the gels loss their structural integrity once they are subjected
to large strain. The subsequent recovery process, that is, the reformation
of a three-dimensional gel structure, is very slow or in some instances
(e.g., DMSO) has not been observed even after prolonged wait time
over multiple days. A similar slow recovery process has also been
observed for the gels melted at elevated temperatures.

were performed immediately after completion of the gelation process.

Although shear rheology is a common
technique to capture the gelation
of LMWGs as a function of time, there are several challenges that
can affect the results. For example, these gels are quite soft and
often dissociate at a small strain (Figure 2c).25 Therefore,
the investigation of the mechanical properties of these gels as a
function of strain and frequency needs to be conducted on the samples
that are prepared on the rheometer itself (in situ rheology). This
process can be time-consuming, and the results can be affected because
of drying of solvent during the prolonged gelation time. Alternatively,
the cavitation rheology technique can be used.55 In cavitation rheology experiments, a needle is inserted
in a gel sample at an arbitrary location, thus creating a defect within
the gel sample at the tip of the needle. The gel at the needle tip
is then pressurized using a syringe pump. During pressurization, the
system pressure increases with time and at the critical pressure, PC, the gel sample at the tip of the needle undergoes
rapid mechanical deformation, resulting in either elastic instability
(cavitation) or fracture of the sample.56 This process is manifested by a sudden increase in cavity growth
(growth of defect) at the tip of the needle. In general, a spherical
cavity is observed when the rapid deformation is caused by elastic
instability, whereas the fracture process causes an irregular growth
of cavity. The critical pressure scales with the gel mechanical properties,
such as the elastic modulus of the sample (E).56 Particularly, for elastic instability, considering
a neo-Hookean material, , and for a fracture-like behavior, , where γ is the
surface energy, rs is the needle radius
or defect size, and Gc is the critical
energy release rate, that
is, the energy required to create a new surface area during the fracture
process.56 This particular technique does
not require any special sample preparation procedure, and the experiments
can also provide insights into the fracture behavior of these gels.

Here, the cavitation rheology experiments were conducted on gels
for a constant gelator concentration of 1.7 mM and organic solvent
volume fraction (ϕsolvent) of 0.20. Figure 3 displays PC for different gels and the images of the corresponding
defect growth or gel deformation at the needle tip. The PC values for these gels are similar, indicating no significant
difference in low-strain elastic moduli of these gels.

Figure 3 Critical pressure (PC) for different
gels obtained from cavitation rheology experiments. The micrographs
illustrate the cavity growth at the tip of the needle. The experiments
were conducted at 22 °C and 72 h after addition of water. The
inner radius of the needle is ≈156 μm. The scale bar
represents 2 mm.

Interestingly, the nature
of gel deformation also depends on the
solvent used. For all gels, except that in DMSO, the cavity growth
was around the needle, extended to the surface. For methanol, the
most unstable gel as described above and having the lowest critical
pressure, the cavity moved toward the sample surface. In comparison,
for the case of DMSO, the cavity remains at the tip of the needle.
In all of these cases, the deformation at the tip of the needle can
be characterized as fracture. Because fracture is the primary mode
of deformation, we can estimate Gc based
on the equation provided above. Considering G′
∼1 kPa, Gc is ∼0.1 J/m2, which is significantly smaller than 1–10 J/m2,57 typically observed for polymeric
gels. Lower values of Gc signify that
the gel can fracture relatively easily.

Rationalization of Solubility
and Gelation Using the Solubility
Parameter Approach
Similar to previous literature reports,26,30 we attempted to link the solubility parameters of the gelator and
solvents to describe the solubility trend and subsequent gel formation. Table 1 presents the Hildebrand
solubility parameters for different solvents (HSPs are shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information).33 The solubility parameters (square root of the
CED) for the gelator are unknown but can be estimated using group
contribution theory.58 We estimated HSPs
as δdispersion ≈ 27.67 MPa0.5,
δpolar ≈ 10.95 MPa0.5, and δH-bond ≈ 6.93 MPa0.5. Correspondingly,
the Hildebrand solubility parameter is estimated as √(δdispersion2 + δpolar2 + δH-bond2) ≈ 30.56 MPa0.5.

For a solid to be soluble in a particular solvent,
the solubility parameters of the solid and the solvent need to be
similar. On the basis of this rule, we would expect the gelator to
have similar solubility in DMSO and ethanol as these solvents have
very similar solubility parameters (see Table 1). This is contrary to the experimental observation,
where the gelator is readily soluble in DMSO under ambient conditions,
whereas we need to heat ethanol to nearly its boiling point to achieve
dissolution of the gelator. Although the Hildebrand solubility parameters
do not capture the solubility trend of this gelator, several observations
can be made from the data presented in Table 1. Dissolution of the gelator in a solvent
with high degree of H-bonding is unfavorable. For example, the gelator
is insoluble in water, which has the highest δH-bond, but it is soluble in 1-propanol, methanol, and ethanol only at
an elevated temperature where the H-bond network is not as extensive
as that in water. Also, aprotic solvents including DMSO, DMF, and
acetone with high δdispersion and with no H-bond
donating capabilities favor dissolution of gelator. Interestingly,
δdispersion for the gelator is far away from δdispersion for these solvents (see Table S1).

To investigate further, the fate of the gelator
after addition
of water has been related to the HSPs of the solvents used here (Figures 4 and S2). Following the trend of solubility, aprotic
solvents resulted in a stable gel. However, for methanol, which has
a high δH-bond, the gel is unstable. In comparison,
1-propanol, which has lower δH-bond compared
to that of the other alcohols used here, provides a stable gel. The
results indicate that the higher degree of H-bonding between solvent
molecules interferes with the H-bonding between gelator molecules
and therefore playing an important role in gel formation and dictating
the stability of the gels. Given the important role of H-bonding and
solvent polarity, we also utilized Kamlet–Taft parameters59−62 and the pyrene-based I3/I1 ratio63 to understand the
solubility and gelation trends. These solvatochromic solvent parameters
are presented in Tables S4 and S5. The
β, π*, and I3/I1 parameters do not show any correlation with the observed
solubility trends. For example, acetone and water have virtually identical
β parameters (0.43 and 0.47, respectively) but have very different
abilities to solubilize the gelator. Similarly, DMSO and water have
similar π* parameters but are at the opposite end of the solubility
scale. The I3/I1 ratio displays a negative correlation for alcohols considered in
the present work. The hydrogen bond donating ability index (α)
displays a weak positive correlation. However, the binary nature of
this parameter (∼0 for molecules without a polar H and ∼1
for solvents with a polar H) presents a significant challenge in utilizing
this parameter as a useful metric. Furthermore, the α parameter
would predict that most nonpolar molecules (with α ∼
0) would dissolve the gelator, which is contrary to the observation
that di-Fmoc-l-lysine is not soluble in hexane.

Figure 4 Fate of the
gelator in different solvents as a function of HSPs
of solvents.

The use of solubility
parameter for capturing the solubility/gelation
rests on the assumption that the binary interaction between the gelator
and solvent can be approximated with the geometric mixing rule.48,49 It has been shown that the geometric mixing rule appears inadequate
when molecules differ significantly in their size as is the case in
the present work.64,65 To overcome this limitation,
we calculated the binary interaction between the gelator and solvent
using DFT. Ideally, one would carry out a detailed molecular simulation
to calculate the solute–solvent interaction, but this will
be an extremely time-consuming process.66 Furthermore, classical simulations rely on empirical force fields
and their accuracy can sometimes be suspect unless there is significant
experimental data to validate the accuracy of the force field. For
this reason, we took an approach that does not rely on empirical force
fields and that does not require extensive computational resources.

We employed hybrid DFT to calculate the binary interaction between
the gelator and solvent at different binding sites. We selected different
binding sites (total of eight) based on the electrostatic potential
map of the gelator (see Figures 1c and 5, which show optimized
geometries of the propanol-gelator at different sites). As can be
seen from Figure 1c,
the negative electronic charge density or more polarizable regions
of the space depicted in red color are near the oxygen atoms in the
functional groups as well as at the aromatic groups.

Figure 5 Optimized structure of
the 1-propanol molecule (solvent) at different
interaction sites around di-Fmoc-l-lysine (gelator).

In addition to elucidating the
different energetic contributions
to the gelator–solvent interaction, this computational approach
allows us to calculate a reasonable estimate of the gelator–solvent
binding energy at different binding sites (Table S2). From Table S2, it is evident
that the site for the strongest binding is different for protic and
aprotic solvents. Protic solvents (water and alcohols) interact strongly
with the acidic functional group at site 3, whereas aprotic solvents
interact strongly with the amide group at site 6 (see Figures 5 and S3). This is because aprotic solvents at site 6 can maximize the interaction
by orienting such that they can form a weak H-bond with the acid group
at site 3, whereas this is not possible for a protic solvent. An arithmetic
average of the binding energy at 8 binding sites provides us the average
binding energy, U (kJ/mol). The molecular volume
(cm3/mol) of the gelator–solvent system at different
binding sites (see Figure 5 in the case of the n-propanol molecule and Figure S3 for the DMSO molecule) is also calculated
(ϑM) and was used to obtain pseudo cohesive energy
density of the gelator–solvent binary mixture as . This is a measure of the binding energy
per unit volume and has the same unit as that of CED. The cohesive
energy of a solvent quantifies the energy gained when individual molecules
associate to form one mole of condensed phase.48,49 It is necessary to normalize this quantity with the molar volume
as larger molecules will generally have larger cohesive energy on
a molar basis. This leads to CED, which is used to calculate the solubility
parameter. Although one can determine these quantities for organic
solvents through enthalpy of vaporization, it is difficult to estimate
CED for polymers or for molecules such as LMWGs that generally have
low vapor pressure.67 Here, we are avoiding
this by directly calculating the solvent/gelator CED. Because we are
not considering the complete solvation sphere, we term this quantity
PCED.

The binding energy of the solvent and the molecular volume
with
the solvent at different binding sites are provided in Tables S2 and S3, whereas in Table 1, we provide the average binding
energy (U) and Λ, which is PCED of the gelator–solvent
(PCEDg-s) normalized by the CED of the solvent,
that is, Λ = PCEDg-s/CEDs. Λ
is a measure of the strength of the gelator–solvent interaction
compared to that of solvent–solvent interactions. As displayed
in Table 1, the average
binding energy of the solvent (U) has a weak correlation
with the solubility and gelation characteristics. Experimentally,
acetone, DMSO, and DMF are found to be good solvents for di-Fmoc-l-lysine, whereas water is a poor solvent. Although the maximum
binding energy (see Table S2) also correlates
with the solubility and gelation, but distinction between the solvents
is not as pronounced. This suggests that selecting a single interaction
site is not a good choice especially for large gelator molecules.
The best correlation with the solubility is obtained with respect
to Λ. When using Λ, we have very clear distinction between
not only gelating and nongelating solvents but also a nongelating
solvent and a solvent that results in an unstable gel. As displayed
in Table 1, the distinction
between methanol that forms an unstable gel and water that forms precipitate
is very clear (0.094 vs 0.035).

Microstructure of Molecular
Gels
Addition of water
triggers nucleation of the gelator followed by growth in the single
and/or multiple dimensions via noncovalent interactions between gelator
molecules. To elucidate the gel structure, atomic force microscopy
(AFM) characterization was conducted on the gel samples in the wet
state, which has rarely been reported in the literature. The main
advantage of this approach is that sample preparation techniques including
drying, freezing, and staining that can potentially introduce some
artifacts were not applied. Figure 6a displays the tapping-mode AFM height image and Figure 6b displays the phase
image of a gel in DMF–water after 2 h of water addition. The
phase image can distinguish various phases present in the system on
the basis of their chemical and physical properties captured through
the phase shifts of the response signal with respect to the applied
signal. A fibrous structure has been observed in the height image;
however, the structure is clearly visible in the phase image because
of a higher contrast. AFM results indicate that the self-assembled
fibers form bundles.

Figure 6 AFM image of a wet gel in the DMF–water system
using the
tapping mode. Height data is shown in (a), whereas the phase image
is shown in (b). The gelator concentration is 3.4 mM and ϕDMF ≈ 0.26.

In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations
were conducted on the gel samples and the results for the gels in
1-proponal and in DMSO are presented in Figures 7 and Figures S4 and S5, respectively. Here, the individual fibers have been imaged. For
both these gels, we have found the fiber diameter of ∼10 nm,
similar to that reported in the literature for other Fmoc-containing
gelators.12 As estimated from the optimized
structure of the gelator molecule, the end-to-end distance is ≈2.3
nm and the width is ≈0.85 nm. This indicates about 10 molecules
stack laterally to form these fibers. TEM images also provide evidence
of branched fiber growth similar to that observed for some peptide
molecules.68,69

at two different locations.
The gelator concentration is 1.7 mM and ϕ1-propanol ≈ 0.26.

To understand early aggregation,
we performed structural optimization
of the gelator dimer using DFT. A dimer can provide important insights
into early stage aggregation without requiring extensive computation
resources. Aromatic moieties can orient in parallel/parallel-displaced
or T/Y-shaped configuration (perpendicular or vertically tilted).70−72 In the case of benzene, both parallel-displaced and T/Y configurations
are nearly isoenergetic.73 However, it
is expected that large rings will favor a parallel or near-parallel
configuration so that rings can maximize π–π interactions.
In the case of di-Fmoc-l-lysine, there is also potential
for hydrogen bonding along the aliphatic segment that contains acid
and amide functional groups. The overall structure of the initial
aggregate will be governed by interplay of primarily H-bond and π–π
interactions. Thus, four different initial conformations were chosen,
AA–BB
and AB–BA both arrangements can stack in parallel and in Y-shaped
configuration (A and B are the aromatic rings of the Fmoc moiety,
as shown in Figure 1c).

Figure 8 presents
the final optimized geometries of the dimers. The most stable dimer
structure (binding energy = 132.97 kJ/mol) is obtained when the two
aromatic moieties maximize their π–π interactions
through parallel stacking and the carboxylic group of one of the molecules
interacts with the carboxylic and amine group of the other molecule
via hydrogen bonding (Figure 8a).

Figure 8 Optimized dimer configurations and their corresponding binding
energies. (a) AA–BB parallel stacking, (b) AA–BB Y-shaped
stacking, (c) AB–BA mixed stacking, and (d) AB–BA Y-shaped
stacking.

The second most stable structure
is the case (Figure 8d) where the dimers stacked
helically. This structure is structurally very different compared
to the most stable structure, but energetically it differs by only
about 3 kJ/mol. In this case, the aromatic moieties are perpendicular
to one another (Y-shape), while only the carboxylic groups of both
molecules participated in the hydrogen bond formation (Figure 8d). In the Supporting Information, we have presented movie files that
provide a three-dimensional view of the optimized geometries. On the
basis of the dimer energetics, we speculate that two lowest energy
structures possibly lead to fiber formation and branching in the gel.

We have not conducted any experimental investigations to study
the initial stage of structure formation. However, several observations
can be made on the basis of the results provided here. The strain-softening
behavior at low strain and the slow recovery process after application
of large strain supports the “crystalline assembly”
process of gelation, a kinetically controlled process.28,53 It has been hypothesized that initially the gelator molecules form
protofibrils, which then self-assemble to form fibers.28,74 However, recent results on the NapFFKYp gelator in water display
a distinctly different behavior, in which the fibers are formed even
with the low gelator concentration and in the solution phase. In future,
we intend to investigate early-stage fiber growth through large-scale
modeling studies and experiments using small-angle scattering techniques.

Conclusions
Here, gelation of di-Fmoc-l-lysine
in various aprotic
and polar solvents and water mixtures using the solvent-triggered
method has been achieved. Gels in different solvent systems display
similar mechanical responses, as characterized using cavitation rheology.
The computational approach adopted here successfully captures the
dissolution of the gelator in various organic solvents. A descriptor,
Λ, which is defined as the PCED of
the gelator–solvent normalized to the CED of the solvent, appears
to successfully correlate with the solubility and gelation characteristics
of the gelator molecule. Furthermore, a fibrous structure was captured
using AFM in the native gel state. DFT calculations indicate that
the parallel and helical stackings of aromatic gelator molecules are
more stable orientations and these stackings might enable fiber growth
that results in a three-dimensional fibrillar network observed with
AFM. The experimental and computational approach applied here can
be useful not only in the field of molecular gelation but also in
any organic self-assembled system and in predicting the solubility
of solids in liquids.

Understanding the solubility and gelation
characteristics of gelators
with multifunctional moieties with hydrogen bonds, polarity, and π–π
interaction presents a significant challenge when utilizing common
empirical parameters such as solubility and/or solvatochromatic parameters.
We believe that our approach that utilizes DFT to quantify the interaction
strength of the solvent and gelator can be a useful tool in rationalizing
the solubility and self-assembly behaviors of complex gelator molecules.

Methods
Materials
Di-Fmoc-l-lysine, methanol, ethanol,
and 1-propanol were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received.
DMSO, DMF, and acetone were obtained from Fisher-Scientific. All solvents
are of high purity (∼99.9%). Deionized water with resistivity
of 18.2 mΩ was used for gel preparation.

Gel Formation Protocol
Hydrogels were prepared in a
two-step process. The gelator was first dissolved in the solvent of
interest (such as DMF, DMSO, acetone, methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol)
and then water was added. The final volume fraction of the solvent
(ϕsolvent = organic solvent volume/total volume)
was fixed either at ϕsolvent ≈0.20 or ≈0.26.
The gelator concentration was also fixed at 1.7 and 3.4 mM for rheological
and microstructural studies. To obtain the phase diagrams, additional
samples with varying gelator concentration from 0.1 to 5 mg/mL were
prepared. To obtain a gel with 1.7 mM gelator concentration, 5 mg
of gelator was dissolved in 1 mL of solvent (ϕsolvent ≈ 0.20) followed by addition of 4 mL of water. The gelator
dissolved easily in DMF, DMSO, and acetone within 10 min. For methanol
and 1-propanol, the samples were heated to 50 °C, whereas for
ethanol, the sample was heated near to its boiling temperature of
78 °C. Once the sample reached the desired temperature, the sample
was removed from the hot plate and a vortex mixer was used for mixing.
Heating and mixing were conducted multiple times until an optically
clear solution was obtained. The mixing process was completed in about
30 min. After mixing of gelator, the solution was allowed to cool
to room temperature (∼22 °C) and water was added at that
temperature. Addition of water turned the clear solution to an opaque
solution in all cases. Then, all of the samples were either molded
or transferred into a rheometer.

TEM
TEM images
were obtained using a JEOL LaB6 transmission
electron microscope operating at 200 keV. Carbon-coated copper grids
(mesh size of 200) were placed on the freshly prepared surfaces for
a minute. The grids were then removed and were dried under vacuum
after carefully removing excess gel using a filter paper.

AFM
AFM images were obtained at room temperature using
a Bruker AFM in TappingMode with the Sharp Nitride Lever (SNL-10)
probe, purchased from Bruker. The samples were casted in an aluminum
mold and were directly imaged with no specific sample preparation
steps. AFM scans were conducted at 512 × 512 pixel resolution
and a scanning rate of 1 Hz, and height data were also first-order
flattened.

Shear Rheology
Dynamic rheological
experiments were
performed using a Discovery Hybrid Rheometer (HR2), TA instruments.
The samples were transferred to the rheometer after addition of water.
A parallel-plate fixture (20 mm) with a solvent trap was utilized
for rheological investigations. The evolution of gel formation as
a function of time was captured using small-amplitude oscillatory
shear experiments at a strain amplitude of 0.1% and a frequency of
5 rad s–1. The gap size was fixed at ∼1500
μm. The experiments were performed at least three times and
representative results were displayed.

Cavitation Rheology
A custom-built cavitation rheology
setup was used to determine the mechanical properties of the gels
and to capture the defect growth inside the sample.55 All experiments were performed after 72 h of water addition
and at room temperature. A flat tip needle with inner radius of ≈156
μm (gauge number 24, Hamilton) was used. Measurements were conducted
with air as a cavitation media and with a compression rate of 2 mL/min.
Cavitation experiments were conducted minimum three times, and the
error bars represent one standard deviation.

Computational Details
All calculations were carried
out using the Gaussian09 quantum chemistry software package.75 Because of torsional flexibility, the gelator
molecule can take different optimized geometries depending upon initial
conformations. Eight optimized geometries were generated; only the
energetically most favorable conformation was picked to perform binding
energy calculations. The M06-2X76 density
functional and the (6-311+g**)77,78 basis set were used
to optimize the geometries for solvent–monomer systems and
to calculate binding energy. An ultrafine grid was used for numerical
integration. During the gelator dimer geometry optimization,
first, a smaller basis set and then gradually larger basis sets were
employed in the following order: (6-31g*),79,80 (6-311g*),77,78 and (6-311g**)77,78 to avoid SCF convergence failure. The frequency calculation was
carried out for each geometry optimization to ensure that the final
structure is a minima (lack of imaginary frequency).
