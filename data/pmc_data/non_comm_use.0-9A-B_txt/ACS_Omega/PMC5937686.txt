RheB GTPase is a Ras-related molecular
switch, which regulates
the mTOR signaling pathway by cycling between the active [guanosine
triphosphate (GTP)] state and inactive [guanine diphosphate (GDP)]
state. Impairment of GTPase activity because of mutations in several
small GTPases is known to be associated with several cancers. The
conventional GTPase mechanism such as in H-Ras requires a conserved
glutamine (Q64) in the switch-II region of RheB to align the catalytic
water molecule for efficient GTP hydrolysis. The conformation of this
conserved glutamine is different in RheB, resulting in an altered
conformation of the entire switch-II region. Studies on the atypical
switch-II conformation in RheB revealed a distinct, noncanonical mode
of GTP hydrolysis. An RheB mutant Y35A was previously shown to exclusively
enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of RheB, whereas the Y35A-D65A
double mutant was shown to reduce the elevated GTPase activity. Here,
we have used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for comprehensive
understanding of the conformational dynamics associated with the fast
(Y35A) and slow (Y35A-D65A) hydrolyzing mutants of RheB. Using a combination
of starting models from PDB structures and in-silico generated mutant
structures, we discuss the observed conformational deviations in wild
type (WT) versus mutants. Our results show that a number of interactions
of RheB with phosphates of GTP as well as Mg2+ are destabilized
in Y35A mutant in the switch-I region. We report distinct water dynamics
at the active site of WT and mutants. Furthermore, principal component
analysis showed significant differences in the conformational space
sampled by the WT and mutants. Our observations provide improved understanding
of the noncanonical GTP hydrolysis mechanism adopted by RheB and its
modulation by Y35A and Y35A-D65A mutants.

Introduction
Ras superfamily GTPases
are guanine nucleotide binding proteins
that function as “molecular switches” by cycling between
guanine diphosphate (GDP)-bound “off” state and a guanosine
triphosphate (GTP)-bound “on” state.1−4 The large conformational changes
accompanying these states are responsible for the regulation of multiple
cellular processes.2,5−8 Members of this superfamily of
GTPases share core G-domain architecture with highly conserved signature
motifs (G1–G5) that are responsible for nucleotide binding
and hydrolysis (Figure 1A). The G1 motif with a consensus sequence of GxxxxGKT/S stabilizes
the phosphates of the nucleotide and is known as a P loop (Figure 1A). G2 has a single
conserved Thr residue, whereas the consensus DxxG residues specify
the G3 region. G2 and G3 motifs mediate large conformational changes
following the transition from GTP to GDP state and vice versa and
are known as switch-I and switch-II regions, respectively (Figure 1A). G4 (NKxD) and
G5 (SAK) motifs together provide contacts required for the stabilization
of the guanine base.9,10

Ras oncogenic mutations are known
to hinder the conventional GTP
hydrolysis process in GTPases, resulting in proteins showing an elevated
activity in the cell.11−14 Significant amount of work has been dedicated to elucidate the mechanism
of GTPase reaction in Ras.15−22 Studies have shown the imperative role of a conserved glutamine
neighboring glycine of DxxG motif in switch-II of G3 region, to align
a catalytic water molecule for GTP hydrolysis.23,24 Also, the role of several conserved and nonconserved residues in
the active site has been elucidated in the GTPase reaction.11,24−30 Since the realization of the critical role of the conserved glutamine
in GTP hydrolysis of Ras, leucine mutants of the same were widely
used among the superfamily proteins as constitutively active forms
to study their cellular functions.11,31−33

Ras homology enriched in brain (RheB), a member of the Ras
superfamily
GTPases, regulates protein translation and cellular growth by mediating
signaling between tumor suppressor proteins TSC1,2 (tuberous sclerosis
complex 1 and 2) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) complex
1.34,35 Unlike other Ras family GTPases, the crystal
structure of RheB shows that the conserved glutamine (Q64) of the
switch-II region adopts a catalytically incompetent conformation35 (Figure 1B). The rate of intrinsic hydrolysis in RheB was found to
be unusually slow compared to Ras, and this was attributed to the
alternate conformation of Q64.35−37 Further, the glutamine to leucine
mutation did not have any effect on the hydrolysis rates of RheB.36 Extensive studies were performed on RheB to
decipher its mode of hydrolysis and develop new strategies to control
the GTP cycle. A noncanonical mode of GTP hydrolysis was proposed,
which details the role of aspartic acid (D65) neighboring the conserved
glutamine (Q64), as a potential water-aligning residue.36 Additionally, Y35 of the switch-I region was
shown to autoinhibit the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of RheB as Y35A
mutant exhibits an elevated hydrolysis rate.36

Here, we present an all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
study of the wild type (WT), Y35A, and Y35A-D65A mutants of RheB.
Our investigation provides the structural rationale toward the effects
of mutations on the intrinsic hydrolysis of RheB GTPase. We report
distinct dynamics at the active site region of RheB, which distinguishes
it from conventional Ras family proteins. Further, these observations
give molecular-level insights into the role of Y35 of switch-I and
D65 of switch-II for the modulation of intrinsic GTP catalysis rates
in RheB.

Methods
Model Preparation
Crystal structures
(PDB ID 4O25 B and 3SEA B) were used as
starting structures for the generation of initial models for the simulations
of RheB WT and RheB Y35A mutant, respectively. The guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate
(GppNHp) nucleotide in the RheB Y35A mutant was replaced with a GTP
molecule. The sequence of the GppNHp-bound RheB Y35A mutant (PDB ID 3SEA B) differs from
the wild type (PDB ID 4O25 B) with a conservative K161R substitution toward the
C-terminal (Figure S1A). Computer-aided
Y35A and Y35A-D65A mutants were generated over the wild-type crystal
structure using UCSF Chimera software package.38 All models were stripped of crystallographic water molecules
prior to system preparation. Table 1 shows the models and their representations followed
in the text. Table 2 represents the production run times of all systems in the current
work.

MD Simulations
All MD simulations were carried out
with the GROMACS simulation package, version 5.0.4, using an all-atom
CHARMM27 force field with CMAP correction and TIP3P rigid water model.39 For simulations, each model was placed in a
cubic box containing TIP3P water with a minimum distance of 10 Å
between the protein atom and the box surface. Counter ions Na+ and Cl– were added for charge neutralization.
Steepest descent energy minimization was used until the system converged
with Fmax no greater than 1000 kJ mol–1 nm–1. Equilibration was performed for 600 ps under NVT and for 1200 ps
under NPT ensemble while coupling proteins, GTP, ions, and water separately.
The temperature was coupled to a V-rescale thermostat with a constant
temperature of 300 K while the pressure was maintained at 1 bar using
a Berendsen thermostat. The coupling constants for the temperature
and pressure to the bath were 0.1 and 1 ps, respectively. The electrostatic
interactions were evaluated using the particle mesh Ewald method.40 A 2 fs integration time step was used for the
production run of each simulation. Four independent trajectories of
100 ns each for the WT, Y35A-xtal, Y35A-mdl, and Y35A-D65A-mdl proteins
were then performed upon the equilibrated systems using leap-frog
algorithm.

Analysis of Trajectories
Analysis
was performed on
8000 conformations generated over four MD runs of 100 ns simulation
time for each protein. GROMACS tools were used to calculate the root-mean-square
deviation, resultant root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of Cα
atoms, principal component analysis (PCA) of backbone Cα atoms,
and surface area accessibility analysis (SASA) of Cα atoms of
proteins and GTP ligand. UCSF Chimera software tool was used for the
visualization and calculation of distances between the atoms. Hydrogen
bond interactions, timeline analysis of the secondary structure (Timeline
plugin), and porcupine plots of the systems were calculated using
the visual MD software tool.41

Water Residence
Time Measurement
The starting structure
of the production run in each system was overlaid with the crystal
structures of H-Ras (PDB ID 5P21), RheB GTPase WT (PDB ID 4O25 B), and RheB GTPase Y35A (PDB ID 3SEA B). The water molecule
in the starting structure of the production run occupying a position
similar to the crystallographic equatorial water molecule was designated
as the equatorial water molecule for each system. Distance between
the oxygen atom of equatorial water and the γ-phosphate of GTP
was measured for the entire duration of the simulation time. The time
the equatorial water molecule resides at below 4 Å distance from
the γ-phosphate of GTP was calculated and reported as residence
times.

Results
MD of the Atypical Conformation
at the Switch-II Region of the
Active Site Correlates with the Slow Intrinsic GTP Hydrolysis Rates
of RheB
The switch-II region in the active GTP state of most
of the small GTPases has a conserved DxxG motif (57DxxG60 in H-Ras),
which stretches into a folded α-helical structure designated
as α2 helix (Figures 1B and 2A). The conformation of the
analogous region differed in RheB (Figure 1B). The GTP-bound RheB crystal structure
(PDB ID 4O25) has two molecules in the asymmetric unit (A and B chains).36 The conformation of α2 helix differs between
the two structures (A and B) in the asymmetric unit of RheB, with
the latter being similar to the previously solved structure of RheB
with GppNHp (PDB ID 1XTR) (Figure 2A). Although
slightly distorted, the structure B of PDB ID 4O25 (WT) still preserves
the octahedral conformation of the essential cofactor Mg2+ similar to other GTP-bound small GTPases (Figure 2). In the structure A of PDB ID 4O25 however, the Mg2+ co-ordination is incomplete with only one water molecule
(Figure 2D). Hence,
we proceeded with the B structure of PDB ID 4O25 (WT) for our MD
simulation studies. Simulations of four independent trajectories of
100 ns each were performed on the WT RheB. We observed that the extended
loop conformation with short 3–10 helices persisted over four
independent simulations of 100 ns each of the WT (Figures 3 and S2). The immediate downstream neighbor of glycine from the 57DTAG60
(H-Ras) motif in the switch-II region is a conserved glutamine (Q61),
which is traditionally recognized as a prerequisite to align the catalytic
water molecule for efficient GTP hydrolysis (Figure 1B). The equivalent Q64 in RheB adopts an
alternate conformation with its side chain away from the active site
(Figure 1B). Previous
structural studies had assumed that this might be because of the bulky
side chain of the proximal R15 residue from the P loop35 (Figure 1B). The analogous residue in H-Ras is G12, which is suggested
to confer dynamic flexibility to the proximal catalytic glutamine
residue of the switch-II region because of the absence of side chain32,36 (Figure 1). Interestingly,
in our study, the side chain of the conserved Q64 remains locked in
the hydrophobic groove formed by L12, P70 and I99, maintaining the
orientation of the Q64 side chain away from the active site for the
entire simulation period (Figures 3, 4, and S2).

The crystal structure of RheB shows a water molecule near
the γ-phosphate
of GTP, analogous to the catalytic equatorial water of H-Ras11,32 (Figure 5). Although
crystallographic water molecules were removed prior to the system
preparation, a water molecule at a similar position was observed during
the start of the simulation of RheB wild type (Figure 5). However, this water molecule was exchanged
within 1 ns timescale with the bulk solvent, suggesting the absence
of stabilizing interactions in the vicinity (Figure S3). Therefore, we assume that the stable atypical conformation
of the conserved Q64 in the switch-II region would not provide a favorable
local electrostatic environment for the GTP catalysis by an equatorial
water molecule. Added to this, the low residence time of equatorial
water (<1 ns) will further diminish the chances for efficient GTP
hydrolysis by RheB.

Y35A Mutation Affects the
Stability of Conserved Interactions
and Water Dynamics at the Active Site
Previous studies have
shown that the Y35A mutation in RheB GTPase accelerates its intrinsic
GTP catalysis rates comparable to H-Ras.36 The crystal structure of Y35A mutant (PDB ID 3SEA) indicates two conformations
in the crystal lattice, each one bound to GDP and GppNHp36 (also discussed in Methods section). The GppNHp-bound structure of RheB Y35A mutant (Y35A-xtal)
displayed only minor conformational variations such as increased solvent
exposure of the nucleotide binding pocket and reduced distance between
the equatorial water molecule and the side chain hydroxyl of T38,
compared to the wild type36 (Figure S1B). The increased rate of GTP hydrolysis
of Y35A mutant was attributed to favorable thermodynamics. Overall,
the activation free energy of hydrolysis was decreased in Y35A mutant.
The bulky electron-rich phenol side chain of Y35 was assumed to destabilize
the transition state.36 We further wanted
to investigate the differences in structural dynamics associated with
the fast hydrolyzing Y35A mutant of RheB.

We found several differences
in the dynamics and stability of the GTP nucleotide in our simulations
of Y35A-xtal. The K19 of P loop is highly conserved among small GTPases
and is responsible for neutralizing the negative charge of GTP by
interacting with the β- and γ-phosphates of the GTP nucleotide.
Compared to the WT, Y35A-xtal showed notable fluctuation in the interaction
of β- and γ-phosphates with the K19 of the P loop (Figure 6A–D). Previous
studies have discussed the conformations adopted by α-, β-,
and γ-phosphates of GTP when bound to H-Ras.19 Here, we observed that the γ-phosphate has variable
dynamics in the simulations of Y35A-xtal compared to WT. We further
quantified this difference by measuring the distance between α-
and γ-phosphate atoms of GTP (Figure 6E,F). In the switch-I region, elevated dynamics
were observed in the interaction of the conserved T38 and Mg2+ ion (Figure 7A,B).
In Y35A-xtal, at switch-II region, the hydrogen bond between backbone
amide nitrogen (NH) of glycine and oxygen of the γ-phosphate
of GTP fluctuates in comparison with the stable hydrogen bond observed
in WT (Figure 7C,D).
These observations suggest that the Y35A mutation destabilizes the
conserved interactions of active site residues with the phosphates
of GTP nucleotide and Mg2+. Interestingly, the equatorial
water remains for longer periods of time in all trajectories compared
to the WT (Figures 5 and 8). Previous experimental study has shown
that the Y35A mutation in RheB GTPase would improve its slow intrinsic
GTP hydrolysis rates similar to that of H-Ras.36 We propose that the destabilization of γ-phosphate
of GTP in the active site of Y35A-xtal might favor its efficient removal.
Similarly, the greater residence time of the equatorial water would
improve the chances for the equatorial water to catalyze GTP hydrolysis.
Taken together, our results show the variable conformational dynamics
observed in the GTP binding site of Y35A-xtal which may provide the
basis for the reported accelerated rates of GTP hydrolysis in the
Y35A mutant of RheB GTPase.36,42

RMSF Plots Reveal Distinctive Cα Fluctuations
in the 3–10
Helix and Switch-I and Switch-II Regions of the Wild Type and Its
Y35A Mutant
We compared the flexibility of each amino acid
residue in the WT and Y35A-xtal by calculating the RMSF of each α-carbon
over four 100 ns simulations of both the proteins. The RMSF profiles
are similar between the two proteins except at the regions corresponding
to the short 3–10 helix downstream of switch-II and the switch-I
regions (Figure 9A).
As anticipated, the switch regions displayed variation in the fluctuation
of the backbone Cα atoms because of the lack of stabilizing
interaction between Y35 and γ-phosphate (Figure 9A). We observed that the high fluctuation
in the Cα atoms in the switch-I region of the WT is because
of the substantial conformational flipping in the residues corresponding
to D33, S34, and Y35 (Figure 9A). The switch-II region displayed notable fluctuation corresponding
to the G63 of 60DxxG63 motif, which as mentioned
previously is involved in the backbone amide and phosphate oxygen
interaction (Figure 7D). At the 3–10 helix, the WT showed a significant variation
in the Cα fluctuation compared to its mutant (Figure 9A). A closer look at MD in
this region revealed that the E40 of switch-I and Y74 of 3–10
helix are at a potential hydrogen bond interaction distance (Figure 9A). Indeed, occupancy
measurements revealed the presence of a hydrogen bond between the
two residues (Figure S4). To evaluate the
stability of this interaction, we plotted the distance between the
side chain Cγ atom of E40 and oxygen atom of side chain hydroxyl
of Y74 as a function of time (Figure 9B,C). The measurements were performed for four 100
ns MD trajectories of the WT and Y35A-xtal proteins. The analysis
showed a significant fluctuation in the distances between the two
atoms in the WT compared to its mutant (Figure 9B,C). The dynamics at the interface of switch-I
and switch-II regions are critical for coordinated transition from
closed (GTP) state to open (GDP) state.43,44 Because this
interaction is away from the catalytic site, it indirectly indicates
that the highly dynamic 3–10 helix in the WT may interfere
with the efficient GTP to GDP conformational transition, accounting
for the slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates of RheB GTPase.

PCA Reveals Notable Variation in the Collective
Dynamics of
the Proteins
PCA is a well-known technique to analyze the
functional collective motions from MD simulation trajectories. To
probe the effect of mutations on the overall combined motion of RheB,
we performed Cα PCA for each system. The projections of PC1
and PC2 for the WT and Y35A-xtal consist of a structural ensemble
of two clusters (Figure 10A,B). The scatter plots indicate that there is a difference
in the eigenvectors computed from the MD trajectories of both the
systems. Further, the WT samples show greater conformational space
compared to Y35A-xtal (Figure 10A,B). To visualize the components that contribute mostly
to the overall motion, porcupine plots for Cα atoms were made
using the two extreme structures generated from the eigenvectors of
both the systems (Figure 10C,D). Interestingly, the dominant motions observed in both
the systems corroborate with their aforementioned dynamics (Figures 7C,D, 9, and 10C,D). The greater conformational
sampling in the WT is contributed by the large motions in the N-terminal
and 3–10 helix downstream of the switch-II region (Figure 10C). The 3–10
helix region also harbors the E40-Y74 hydrogen bond interaction which
is not stable in the WT compared to Y35A-xtal (Figure 9). Similarly, the motions in the switch-II
region of Y35A-xtal concur with its previously quantified variable
dynamics between the backbone amide (NH) of G63 and γ-phosphate
of GTP (Figures 10B and 7D). Together, these results show that
the increase in hydrolysis rates of the Y35A mutant is accompanied
by an overall change in its molecular motions and its associated conformational
dynamics.

MD Simulations of the Y35A-mdl
and Y35A-D65A-mdl Systems Provide
Additional Insights into the Reduced GTP Hydrolysis Rate of Y35A-D65A
Mutant
Previous studies have shown that the Y35A-D65A double
mutation reduces the enhanced intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates of the
Y35A mutant by at least 60%.36 The contrasting
dynamics observed between the WT and Y35A-xtal provided the impetus
to decipher the molecular motions of the Y35A-D65A double mutant.
Because no crystal structure is available for the Y35A-D65A double
mutant, we used the in silico-generated double mutation on WT as a
starting model for the MD simulation (Table 1). Simultaneously, we also generated Y35A
in silico single mutant (Table 1) to compare, correlate, and understand the conformational
dynamics of in silico-generated Y35A-D65A double mutant (Table 1). Both Y35A-mdl and
Y35A-D65A-mdl systems were simulated for four 100 ns independent trajectories
similar to the WT (Table 2). Y35A-mdl did not show significant changes in the dynamics
of the interactions of the conserved residues of switch-I and switch-II
with GTP nucleotide and Mg2+ as previously described for
Y35A-xtal, suggesting that the simulations would need to be run for
a sufficiently long time for the system to reach the energy minima
of Y35A-xtal (Figure 11A). Despite this, the RMSF plots of Y35A-mdl and Y35A-D65A-mdl showed
similar consistent interaction between E40 and Y74 (Figures 11B–D and S4). In addition, the double mutant displayed
reduced Cα fluctuations in the switch regions (Figure 11B). The PCA porcupine plots
indicate that Y35A-D65A-mdl has dominant motions at the N-terminal
similar to the WT (Figures 10C and S5D). However, the rest of
Y35A-D65A-mdl including the switch regions displayed restricted motions
compared to the WT (Figures 10C and S5D). Previous experimental
studies have shown that the electronegative D65 residue is required
for aligning the catalytic water molecule similar to the conventional
glutamine in H-Ras.36 Therefore, our results
show that the additional D65A mutation would possibly constrain the
dynamics of switch regions accounting for the reduction in the hydrolysis
rates observed for the double mutant. Unlike the WT, the residence
time of equatorial water is also sufficiently longer in the simulation
of Y35A-xtal, suggesting efficient GTP hydrolysis (Figure 8). Despite the very low residence
time of analogous water molecule in the simulation of computer-generated
mutants, the water molecule in Y35A-mdl stays at least double the
amount of time as the WT before being exchanged with the bulk solvent
(Figure S3). These observations suggest
a similar trend for the simulation of Y35A-mdl as the crystal structure.
In addition, the PCA and RMSF plots of the double mutant show the
possible role for the distinct collective motions and reduced switch
region dynamics for the reduced rate of GTP hydrolysis (Figures 11B and S5).

Discussion
The
mechanism of intrinsic/GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis in H-Ras
GTPase dictates the imperative role for a conserved glutamine (Q61)
of switch-II region.32,45,46 Therefore, until recently, the glutamine to leucine mutants of Ras
superfamily GTPases were used as constitutively active proteins for
cellular studies.33,47,48 However, recent studies have detailed the potential disparity between
the expected and observed phenotypes of such mutations.49 For RheB (Ras homology enriched in brain), the
analogous conserved glutamine adopts the atypical conformation with
its side chain pointed away from the active site (Figure 1B). Accordingly, its leucine
mutation does not affect the function of the RheB GTPase.35,36 The atypical conformation of the conserved glutamine was reasoned
to be a consequence of proximal bulky side chain of R15 from P loop
(Figure 1B). However,
the arginine to glycine mutation does not affect the intrinsic hydrolysis
rates of RheB, suggesting that the conformation of glutamine side
chain remains unaltered even after the mutation.36 Our results corroborate this and show that the side chain
of the conserved Q64 remains packed in a crowded hydrophobic environment
remote from the influence of R15 side chain (Figure 4).

Y35 of the switch-I region is highly
conserved among Ras and Rho
family GTPases compared to the Rab GTPases. However, the analogous
Y-to-A mutation on slow, intrinsically hydrolyzing Rab6 and Rab7 GTPases
is shown to increase their rates by several fold.45,50 Although the exact role of tyrosine still remains elusive, studies
assume it to influence the GTP hydrolysis process by blocking the
access to bulk water.50 Similarly, the
analogous Y35A mutation of RheB GTPase is shown to accelerate its
GTP hydrolysis activity.36 Our SASA analysis
of Cα atoms of protein and GTP ligand revealed only minor variations
between the WT and Y35A-xtal (Figure S6). Interestingly, we observed noticeable variations in the stability
of several conserved interactions of Y35A-xtal with GTP and Mg2+ (Figures 6 and 7). Moreover, the mutation also impairs
the traditional octahedral geometry of Mg2+ ion20,30 (Figure 2A). In addition,
the mutation also stabilizes the positioning of equatorial water with
interactions from oxygen atoms of γ-phosphate and backbone oxygen
of T38 (Figures 5 and 8 and S7). The dynamic
flexibility of γ-phosphate and accessibility of stable equatorial
water concur with the previously established elevated rates of GTP
hydrolysis in RheB Y35A mutant.36,42

The Cα
RMSF plot of Y35A-mdl differed from Y35A-xtal only
at the catalytic switch regions (Figure 11A). Accordingly, the variable dynamics previously
observed at the active site of Y35A-xtal simulations were not seen
in the simulations of Y35A-mdl (Figures 6 and 7). Unlike Y35A-xtal,
the starting model for Y35A-mdl would have residue network organization
identical to that in the WT. We assume that the system may need to
be energy minimized and run for a sufficiently long time to reach
the energy minima of Y35A-xtal. In agreement, the PCA overlay shows
the ensemble of two clusters at similar positions but varied densities
(Figure S5A). However, Y35A-mdl showed
a trend in dynamics at the 3–10 helix similar to that in Y35A-xtal
(Figure 11B,C). These
observed variations were taken into account while analyzing the simulations
of Y35A-D65A-mdl. The RMSF plots of Y35A-D65A-mdl showed restricted
dynamics at the catalytic switch regions. The motions in the porcupine
plots also indicate restricted motions in the switch regions of Y35A-D65A-mdl
compared to the other systems in the study (Figures 10, S5). Similarly,
the residence time for equatorial water was unusually short as compared
to Y35A-mdl (Figures 11B and S3). On the basis of these observations,
we speculate an additional role for the D65 residue in conferring
dynamic flexibility to the switch regions of RheB, in addition to
its previously described role as a potential water-aligning residue.36

Recent studies have identified several
point mutations at distinct
positions of RheB GTPase that are associated with several cancers.34,51 The E40 of switch-I is involved in contrasting fluctuations with
its interaction of Y74 of 3–10 helix between the WT and Y35A-xtal/Y35A-mdl
(Figures 9 and 11). Interestingly, E40K is one of the several mutants
identified in the renal cancers.52 Similarly,
Y35N is the most recurring oncogenic point mutation observed in RheB.51 Although the exact structural basis is yet to
be identified, Y35N mutation was shown to act as a hyperactive GTPase
inside the cell.51 Our work on Y35A mutation
provides preliminary assessment of the possible destabilization effects
on the γ-phosphate of GTP nucleotide. However, separate studies
need to be conducted to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of
the functioning of these mutants. Taken together, our findings provide
fresh insights into the molecular basis for the noncanonical mode
of GTP hydrolysis in RheB. Further, it provides the mechanistic evidence
for the differential modulation of GTP catalysis by RheB mutants Y35A
and Y35A-D65A.
