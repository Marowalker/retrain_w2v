A hybrid nanofibrous
mat consisting of polyurethane, dextran, and
10 wt % of biopigment (i.e., pyocyanin) was facilely fabricated using
a direct-conventional electrospinning method. The field emission scanning
electron microscopy showed the bead-free fibers with a twisted morphology
for the pyocyanin-loaded mat. The addition of pyocyanin enables the
unprecedented approach to tailor the hydrophilicity of hybrid mat,
as verified from the water contact measurement. Thermomechanical stabilities
of electrospun mats were investigated in terms of thermogravimetric
analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical
analysis. The bacterial inhibition test revealed that the antibacterial
activity of electrospun mat containing pyocyanin was 98.54 and 90.2%
toward Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. By the combined
efforts of rapid release of pyocyanin and oxidative stress, the PU–dextran–pyocyanin
(PUDP) electrospun mat significantly declined the viable cell number
that disrupts the cell morphology. Hence, the proposed PUDP electrospun
mat must meet the requirements of efficient antimicrobial material
in various applications such as disinfectant wiping, food packaging,
and textile industries.

1 Introduction
The
development of disposable, cost-competitive, potential, and
selective destabilization of bacteria is an urgent need in pharmaceuticals,
filtrations, textiles, food packaging, and environmental monitoring,
owing to their serious and often infections to the living environment.
Despite various advancements in the medicinal chemistry domain, most
of the natural compounds can only able to form folk medicines such
as penicillin, carbapenems, and cephalosporins.1−4 Although they are in current use
after semi-synthetic modifications, still there remains a significant
clinical concern. The continuous evolution of pathogenic bacterial
resistance to existing semi-synthetic drugs in accordance with the
evolutionary process of continuous drug developments demands an alternative
emerging agent such as natural bioactive compounds pyocyanin (N-methyl-1-hydroxyphenazine). Pyocyanin is a pro-oxidant
and redox-modulating secondary metabolite, which has superior antibacterial
activity regulated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.5−7 Pyocyanin can readily diffuse inside the cell membrane of bacteria
because of its low-molecular-weight (210 Da) zwitterion and subsequently
can convert molecular O2 to superoxide O2× as a nonenzymatic oxidizing
agent using NAD(P)H.8,9 It was reported that about 90–95%
of antimicrobial inhibitions of P. aeruginosa strains caused because of the generation of water-soluble secondary
metabolite, that is, pyocyanin.6 El-Zawawy
et al. investigated about the combating efficiency of pyocyanin ointment
against skin fungus, that is, Trichophyton rubrum.10 In another one study, it was reported
that substances such as pyocyanin secreted by P. aeruginosa showed antibiotic actions in vivo on Candida species which were grown on Sabroud’s Dextrose Agar.11 The pyocyanin has been applied to fight against
other pathogens to reduce crude oil degradation, whereas biosurfactants
are used in textile industries and leather processing industry because
of their antibacterial efficiency.12 According
to Saha et al., phenazine pigment pyocyanin can be exploiting as an
antibacterial agent and food colorants in food and beverage industries.13 There are reports on the antagonistic effect
of P. aeruginosa against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella
paratyphi, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by synthesizing
pyocyanin.6,13,14 The aforementioned
reports certify that pyocyanin is a potential bioactive compound to
destabilize the bacteria and can applicable in antibiotics, membrane
filters, protective textiles, and food packaging. Different sorts
of antibacterial carrier systems have been developed, by incorporation
of antibacterial substances into a packet connected to the carrier,
direct incorporation of antibacterial substances into carrier films/coating
the antibacterial packages on the carrier matrix.

Polymer nanofibers
hold considerable attention in diverse applications
such as optical devices, filtrations, energy devices, and biomedical
areas because of their exclusive features including ultrahigh specific
surface area, flexibility, tailored morphology of fibers, tunable
pore size, and drug-carrying competency. A number of techniques including
pressurized gyration, phase separation, blowing, melt/solution blowing,
and centrifugal spinning have been developed for the fabrication of
polymer nanofibers. At present, electrospinning has emerged as a well-recognized
engineering technique to fabricate seamless ultrafine fibers with
tunable diameter size. In the electrospinning process, polymer solution/melt
is driven electrostatically from the syringe and the discharged polymer
solution jet is accelerated toward the grounded collector because
of charge separation.

Further, the solvent evaporates, and the
highly stretched polymer
fiber deposits on a grounded collector.15,16 By incorporation
of a biocide in the electrospun nanofiber membrane, the unique result
toward structural composition and excellent antibacterial activity
can be achieved.17 Kenaway et al. first
reported about the incorporation of a biocide agent in nanofibers
through electrospinning with controlled release.18 Because numerous hydrophobic and hydrophilic biocides including
chlorhexidine, triclosan, QACs, and PHMB have been applied to conventional
fibers for various industrial and household disinfections as well
as for antibacterial finishing,19−21 these biocides are typically
mixed in the polymer solutions prior to electrospinning and in consequence
a burst release of those bioactive agents from the nanofibers inside
any aqueous solutions. One previous study showed that the control
release of ampicillin from electrospun poly (methyl methacrylate)–nylon
6 core/shell-based nanofibers was able to inhibit Listeria
innocua growth effectively.22 Kim et al. published that the sustained release of drug (Mefoxin)
from electrospun poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-based
scaffold nanofibers was effective to inhibit S. aureus growth up to 90%.23

Polyurethane
(PU) is a cost-effective, biodegradable, chemical
resistance, non-antigenic, and nonimmunogenic polymer. It is associated
with intrinsic features such as elasticity, clarity, tunable mechanical
properties, and self-healing effects.24 The network of physical bond of PU is capable of rearrangement when
it was subjected to different temperatures and different mechanical
loads and while interaction with rigid heterogeneous domains.25 Although, PU is suitable for an electrospun
nanofiber membrane, it has low compatibility with biocide because
of its extreme hydrophobic behavior.26 If
any hydrophilic polymer blends with PU, then, it enables the electrospun
nanofiber membrane to encapsulate biocide. Dextran, produced by lactic
acid bacteria, is a highly suitable polymer for producing the electrospun
blend membrane because it is compatible with both hydrophobic PU and
hydrophilic bioactive agents because of its amphiphilic behavior.26 This unique solubility characteristic of dextran
helps for directly blending with biodegradable polymers such as PU
to prepare composite nanofibrous membranes through electrospinning
after mixed solution in organic solvents. Because of its unique solubility
characteristic, mechanical strength and swelling properties of dextran
in water could thereby be modulated.27 Although P. aeruginosa can cause cystic fibrosis by producing
pyocyanin during infection, this study aims a trail to develop modified
novel antibacterial PU–dextran (PUD) electrospun nanofibers
by incorporating natural pyocyanin extracted from P.
aeruginosa as a promising biomedical antibacterial
active compound after considering its great bactericidal efficiencies
against bacteria in order to apply in various fields such as biomedical,
textile, and food packaging. Pyocyanin has been used as a barrier
to prevent bacterial growth. The pyocyanin production by bacteria
was determined by the LC–MS technology. Furthermore, the modified
nanofibers were explored in order to assess an antibacterial efficiency
against Gram-positive S. aureus and
Gram-negative E. coli, and in vitro
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the presence of pyocyanin
incorporated with nanofibrous scaffolds was also determined. The bacterial
apoptotic death was analyzed by FACS. The scaffolds were further characterized
by scanning electron, atomic force microscope (AFM), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and by Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) technology.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
PU (medical grade Mw = 110 000) was received from Cardio Tech Intern.,
Japan. Dextran (from Leconostoc mesenteroides, average Mw = 8500–11 500) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethyl formamide (DMF) and methyl ethyl ketone/2-butanone (MEK)
were procured from Samchun Chemicals, South Korea. The Luria–Bertani
medium was obtained from BD Difco, United States. Standard pyocyanin
and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate were supplied
by Sigma-Aldrich. S. aureus (KACC 10768)
and E. coli (KACC 11304) were collected
from Korean Agricultural Culture Collection. P. aeruginosa (KCTC 1750) was obtained from Korean collection for type Cultures.
FITC-Annexin V with a PI apoptosis detection kit was purchased from
Bio-legend, San Diego, United States.

2.2 Pyocyanin
Production
Bacto Peptone
(20 g), MgCl2 (1.4 g), K2SO4 (10
g), glycerol (2%), and glucose (2%) were charged together into 1000
mL of DI water in a conical flask.28,29 The solution
was then transferred to an autoclave and sterilized at 121 °C
for 15 min. Separately, P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown in a Luria–Bertani medium at 37 °C for
12 h. The P. aeruginosa PAO1 suspension
was inoculated into the above-prepared pyocyanin Broth medium (1:100
v/v) at 37 °C for 48 h. The obtained supernatants were collected,
centrifuged (10 000 rpm for 10 min), and filter-sterilized at room
temperature.

2.3 Pyocyanin Extraction and
Purification
Pyocyanin was extracted according to the procedure
reported in refs (30) and (31). The above-prepared
filter-sterilized
supernatant and chloroform (1:1 v/v) were mixed thoroughly by vortex
in a test tube. The obtained pale blue suspension was collected and
dried at room temperature for 72 h. The residue was then dissolved
in 1 mL of acetonitrile and subjected to liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS). Pyocyanin was purified via a procedure
reported in refs (10) and (13). The blue
suspension (pyocyanin solution; ∼3 mL) was mixed into 1.5 mL
of 0.2 M HCl in another test tube until attaining the pink color.
The pink suspension was transferred to a fresh test tube, and the
borate–NaOH buffer (0.4 M, pH—10) was added into this
suspension until the color changes to blue. Afterward, the blue-colored
pyocyanin was again re-extracted with chloroform, and this step was
repeated twice to get a clear blue pure pyocyanin solution. Finally,
the pyocyanin powder was recovered by completely evaporating the chloroform.

2.4 Electrospinning
The electrospun mats
were prepared via an electrospinning method, in which the mixed solution
of DMF/MEK (1:1) containing PU (80%) and dextran (20%) was stirred
at room temperature for 72 h. Then, 10 wt % pyocyanin (with respect
to polymer) was added with the above blend, and the mixture was stirred
at room temperature until attaining a homogeneous solution. The mixture
solution was loaded into the 5 mL syringe with a microtip. A conventional
horizontal electrospinning setup, consisting of a high-voltage supplier,
a capillary tube, a syringe pump with a stainless steel needle, and
a metal drum collector, was used in this study. A voltage of 22 kV
was created between the tip and collector, and the voltage has conquered
the viscosity of polymeric solution thereby allows to form the interconnected
fibers.

3 Characterizations
3.1 Morphological Characterizations
The
surface morphology of electrospun mat specimens was captured by field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (SUPRA 40VP) comprising
direct and cross detectors. The imaging was performed after gold sputtering.
The surface roughness of mat specimens was investigated using an AFM
(multimode-8 model), in a tapping mode. The shape deformation of bacteria
(after inhibition) on PU, PUD, and PU–dextran–pyocyanin
(PUDP) electrospun mats was observed using FE-SEM. Prior to analysis,
the electrospun mats were immersed into the first fixation solution
(2% paraformaldehyde + 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate
buffer) and second fixation solution (1% osmium tetroxide in 0.05
M sodium cacodylate buffer) for 12 h and 15 min, respectively. Subsequently,
the samples were stained with 1% uranyl acetate in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate
buffer. Dehydration was performed in a graded series of ethanol (30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100% each for 10 min), and the electrospun
mats were dried in air at room temperature. Then, the mats were mounted
on aluminum sample stubs and sputtered with gold.

3.2 Structural Characterizations
The
functional groups in electrospun mat specimens were characterized
by a FT-IR spectrometer (spectrum GX model) at the frequency range
of 4000–400 cm–1, where the KBr pellet method
was exploited for sample preparation. LC–MS (Agilent 6410B
Triple Quadrupole) was used to confirm the production of pyocyanin
form P. aeruginosa PAO1. An aliquot
of 3 μL of the processed samples was injected into the high-performance
liquid chromatography (1200 Series) equipped with a 2.6 μm C8
column (100 Å, 50 × 2.1 mm, Kinetex) maintained at 30 °C.
Cone voltage, capillary voltage, and source offset were set to be
30 kV, 3 kV, and 30 V, respectively. The source temperature was maintained
at 380 °C throughout the experiment. ESI was operated at the
potential of +3000 V. Mobile phase A (water and 0.1% formic acid)
and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile) were used for
all experiments to separate the analyte at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min
over the time of 20 min. Nebulizer pressure, gas flow of desolvation,
cone, fragmentor voltage, and collision voltage were set at 15 bar,
650 L/h, 150 L/h, 70 V, and 10 V, respectively. Data acquisition was
performed with MassHunter Software (Version B.04.00).

3.3 Thermal and Mechanical Characterizations
The thermal
behaviors of the specimens of electrospun mats were
analyzed using the TA Instruments (Q-50 model), and the analysis was
conducted from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate increment of 5
°C/min under N2 gas atmosphere. Glass-transition temperatures
of the electrospun mat specimens were investigated using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Q20 thermal analysis system—TA
instruments) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere.
The mechanical stabilities of the electrospun mat specimens were evaluated
from the stress–strain curves obtained with a universal testing
machine (LR5K plus 5 kN, Ametek Lloyd instruments Ltd) at a strain
rate of 10 mm/min.

4 Measurements
4.1 Contact Angle
Wettability of electrospun
mat samples was measured by static water contact angle using a contact
angle goniometer (DSA10, Kruss GmbH analyser, Germany). The detailed
procedure of the contact angle measurement can be found in the literature.32

4.2 In Vitro Drug Release
The % of pyocyanin
in the electrospun mat was determined from the pyocyanin release in
the buffer solution (0.15 mol L–1). A piece of PUDP
electrospun sample with an area of 2 cm × 2 cm was soaked into
10 mL of buffer solution at 37 °C for 24 h. To measure pyocyanin
release, 1 mL of above solution was exposed to UV-rays. By measuring
the intensity of λmax of pyocyanin (i.e., 691 nm),
the % of pyocyanin contained in the electrospun sample was determined.33 The measurement was repeated three times for
the electrospun mat using different specimens, and the average value
was used for calculation. The % of pyocyanin release was calculated
by using the following equation 1  where C0 and C∞ refer
to the concentration pyocyanin
in the buffer solution before and after immersing an electrospun mat.

4.3 In Vitro Antibacterial Activity
4.3.1 Quantitative Analysis
Preactivated
[subcultured in a fresh Luria–Bertani Broth medium at 37 °C
under shaking condition (220 rpm) in an incubator for overnight] E. coli and S. aureus were inoculated separately in 5 mL of the LB liquid medium, incubated
at 37 °C until the log growth phase was achieved (OD600 value ≈ 0.6). After incubation, the bacterial culture was
centrifuged (8000 rpm for 10 min) and washed with the sterile phosphate-buffered
solution (PBS). The cell pellets were suspended in the PBS solution
to attain a final density of 106 cells/mL (standardized
spectrophotometrically OD540 ≈ 1.0).16 Followed by, the dynamic contact test was conducted
to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the electrospun mat containing
pyocyanin quantitatively.20 A piece of
electrospun fiber mat (2 cm × 2 cm) was soaked into 10 mL of
bacterial suspension in a Erlenmeyer flask and kept under shaking
condition (220 rpm) at 37 °C up to 12 h (Scheme 1). To measure the viable cell count, the
surface spread plate method was employed. Initially, 1 mL of suspension
was taken from the bacterial sample at 2 h of interval over the period
of 12 h and followed by decimal serial dilutions with PBS. From these
dilutions, 0.05 mL was taken and spread onto sterile agar plates and
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the colonies were
counted and expressed as mean colony-forming units per milliliter
(CFU/mL) after multiplication with the dilution factor.

Scheme 1 Schematic
Diagram of the Experimental Setup Used To Measure the Antibacterial
Activity upon Exposure to the PUDP Mats
The antibacterial activity of electrospun mats were further
assessed
by calculating the percentage of bacterial inhibition. The required
amount of the electrospun mat was immersed into the 5 mL E. coli or S. aureus liquid bacterial medium. To evaluate the antibacterial activity,
the bacterial medium was exposed to UV-light. By measuring the optical
density of the bacterial medium (i.e., 600 nm), the remaining quantity
of bacteria was determined using a spectrophotometer. The optical
density was measured at 2 h of intervals over a period of 12 h. The
measurement was repeated three times for each electrospun mat using
different samples, and the mean value was used for calculation. Following
equation was used to calculate the % of bacterial inhibition 2  where IC and IS are the average optical density
values of
the control group and the experimental group, respectively.23

4.3.2 Qualitative Analysis
of the Antimicrobial
Activity
In the qualitative analysis, the antimicrobial activity
was evaluated via a disk diffusion method.34E. coli or S. aureus (prior grown culture for overnight) was spread over the solid agar
plates. Subsequently, electrospun mat samples (diameter 6 mm) were
placed on the agar plates. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h, and the zone of inhibition (ZOI) for each sample over the
agar plate was visually examined. The experiment was repeated three
times for each electrospun mat using different samples, and the reported
value is the average of experiments.

4.3.3 ROS
Detection
Accumulation of ROS
was measured using an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate
(DCFH-DA).35 Exponentially grown bacteria
were harvested, washed with PBS buffer (pH—7.2), and resuspended
in PBS buffer. Next, the bacterial cells were stained with 10 μM
DCFH-DA for 30 min at 37 °C under dark condition. The cells were
washed with copious amount of water until the removal of excess DCFH-DA.
The stained bacterial cells were incubated with electrospun mats (2
cm × 2 cm) for 4 h. Finally, the samples were examined by a fluorescence
microscope (LSM 510 META-Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at an excitation
wavelength of 488 nm and at an emission wavelength of 535 nm. The
fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the ROS level within
the cell cytosol.36

4.3.4 Determination of Apoptosis
The
dissipation of bacterial cells after treating with electrospun mats
was examined with FITC-Annexin V with a PI apoptosis detection kit
using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (USA, BD). The electrospun mats
(2 cm × 2 cm) were immersed into the bacterial solution containing
the cells of 1 × 107 for 12 h. Subsequently, the mats
were taken out, remaining bacterial solution centrifuged and washed
with PBS buffer (pH—7.2) to remove bacterial media. The obtained
cell pellet was resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer, and the staining
process was carried out according to the protocol given in the kit.
Finally, the stained cells were analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur flow
cytometer, and data were acquired using FlowJo 10.0.7 software (Treestar
Inc, Ashland, US).

5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Determination of Pyocyanin
The identification
of the presence of pyocyanin in the culture filtrate of P. aeruginosa was performed via a sensitive analysis
method by using LC–MS. The absorption peak of the culture filtrate
showed the almost identical absorption peak of standard pyocyanin.
Figure S1 (Supporting Information) displays
the obtained chromatogram. The retention time of standard pyocyanin
matches with the culture filtrate, and the full scan positive ion
matches with the molecular mass of pyocyanin. Hence, it endorses the
presence of pyocyanin in the supernatant.

5.2 Morphological
Properties
The morphologies
of the natural PU nanofibers, PUDP nanofibers, and hybrid PUDP nanofibers
were analyzed by FE-SEM, and the micrographs are shown in Figure 1. The PU nanofibers
exhibit a smooth surface and a flat weblike structure without beads
or agglomerated with diameter 400–600 nm. The flat ribbon-like
nanofibers have changed to ellipse shape spun homogeneous nanofibers
after the addition of dextran. Compare to PU and PUD, the microstructure
of PUDP nanofibers showed round fibers with a skin that sometimes
twisted and wrinkled bend irregularly. An astute scrutiny in the morphology
of PUDP nanofibers narrates well mixing of pyocyanin with nanofibers.
It can be clearly observed that the PUDP nanofibers exhibited wrinkle
and crumpled morphology where the aromatic and aliphatic chains of
polymers and pyocyanin possibly clenched together. The attained crumpling
was due to the Π–Π stacking and H-bonding between
the polymer chains and pyocyanin, which enables the effectual dispersion
of pyocyanin throughout the nanofiber mat. Scheme 2 shows the possible interactions applied
between the components in the hybrid nanofiber mat. Therefore, it
demonstrates a good compatibility between pyocyanin, polymer, and
solvent. The incorporation of pyocyanin seems to significantly alter
the smooth fibrous morphology and diameter of nanofibers. The viscosity
or conductivity of electrospinning solution influences the morphological
structure and average size of the obtained fibers.37 The slightly twisted structure of the PUDP nanofibers than
that of pure PU nanofibers is presumably due to the increase of the
solution viscosity or the solution conductivity which was caused by
the introduction of pyocyanin and dextran as a foreign species in
the electrospinning solution.38 From Figure 1 (inset), it can
be observed that the water contact angle of PUDP was 38.8°, revealing
the hydrophilic surface of the hybrid electrospun mat because of its
hydrophilic functionalities. On the other side, the contact angle
of bare PU is 125°. It is noteworthy that the hydrophilic character
of PU enhanced after blending with dextran and pyocyanin. Collectively,
the more hydrophilic surface of the PUDP electrospun mat facilitates
the attachment of bacterial cells during antibacterial applications.
The AFM images of electrospun mat specimens are displayed in Figure 2. The surface roughness
that calculated for fibers was considerably increased after mixing
with pyocyanin. Thus, pyocyanin had an influence on the increase in
the surface roughness of the PUDP mats. It proves that successful
incorporation of pyocyanin into the PUD matrix resulted in the interactions
between the pyocyanin and PUD chain which may result in the enhanced
surface roughness. Jaganathan et al. reported an increased surface
roughness of the PU hybrid membrane after adding mustard oil, which
is in agreement with this present study.39 Furthermore, a rougher surface of the membrane is important for
the antibacterial activity. The higher surface roughness is more advantageous
for bacterial solution uptake and easy binding with bacteria.40

Nanofiber Mat
5.3 Structural
Properties
FT-IR spectra
were recorded to investigate the intermolecular bond stretching in
constructed electrospun mats, and Figure S2 portrays the obtained FT-IR spectra. The peak appearing at 3336
cm–1 in PU, PUD, and PUDP specifies the existence
of −OH groups (attributed to hydrogen bonds) in electrospun
mats. The peak appearing at 2960 cm–1 in PU, PUD,
and PUDP specifies the existence of −OH groups (attributed
to alcoholic groups) in electrospun mats. The characteristic peaks
found at 1721 cm–1 are common for all of the three
electrospun mats, which is attributed to the C=O stretching
of PU and dextran. There is no new pyocyanin peak observed for PUDP
because the functional groups of pyocyanin are also present in polymers.10 The small peak shifts in hybrid electrospun
mats with respect to pristine PU electrospun mat were observed, representing
strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between the polar groups of (−OH,
−O–, C=O) PU, dextran, and pyocyanin.

5.4 Thermal Stability
TGA thermographs
of the fabricated electrospun mats are demonstrated in Figure S3. Pristine PU exhibited a single step
weight drop with the onset temperature of 300 °C, owing to the
crystallinity of PU, whereas the hybrid electrospun mats depicted
two-step weight drops: (i) from 30 to 230 °C and (ii) from 240
to 450 °C. The former two is due to the desorption of free water
molecules and detachment of hydrophilic functionalities. The second
is because of disintegration of the aromatic backbones of the polymer.
The thermal behavior of hybrid electrospun mats shifts toward the
low temperature throughout the study, representing the manifestation
of less thermal stability of the hybrid membrane, caused because of
the hydrophilic functionalities of dextran and pyocyanin.

DSC
thermograms were recorded in order to further scrutinize the thermal
behaviors of electrospun mats. Figure S3 exhibits the all obtained endothermic inflexions (Tg) of electrospun mats. Compared with the pristine PU,
slightly lower Tg is noticed for hybrid
electrospun mats because of the sluggish reorganization of polymer
backbones in hybrids caused by interfacial interactions such as H-bonding
and Π–Π interactions. The Tg values yielded by PU, PUD, and PUDP mats are 174, 164, and
172 °C, respectively.

5.5 Thermomechanical Stability
Mechanical
strength of the electrospun mats was investigated by DMA, and the
results are presented in Figure S4. Figure S4a shows the modulus curves of electrospun
mats. The maximum storage modulus of the bare PU membrane was 549
MPa, whereas the PUD and PUDP hybrid electrospun mats exhibited the
maximum storage moduli of 558 and 221 MPa, respectively. The extended
storage modulus of the PUD membrane was associated with the mutual
interaction, such as hydrogen-bonding Π–Π interactions,
between the backbone chains of PU and dextran. In the case of PUDP
mat, the mat contains higher number of bound water molecules, which
causes the rapid relaxation of hybrid mat during elongation. Therefore,
the PUDP mat has a lower storage modulus compared to bare PU and PUD
mats.

5.6 In Vitro Drug Release
The pyocyanin
release profiles from the PUDP hybrid mat are shown in Figure 3. The behavior of these electrospun
mats showed an initial burst release of pyocyanin after immersing
the PUDP sample into the PBS buffer with a pH of 7.4. Approximately,
60–80% of the pyocyanin was released in the burst phase within
the first 24 h. The remaining pyocyanin was releasing at a gradual
slower speed. The release profile of mixed bioactive agents was investigated
by many researchers and reported to be a biphasic profile which follow
initial burst release and further slower process.18,20,23 Zheng et al. proposed that the rapid release
of amoxicillin (AMX) may be because of the fact that the physical
interaction between AMX and n-HA (e.g., hydrogen
bonding) is not sufficiently strong.38 Hence,
in our study also, the burst release of pyocyanin in the starting
phase is thought to be due to the same fact that the bonding interaction
between pyocyanin and polymers (e.g., π–π interaction
and H-bonding) is not strong enough. Moreover, the electrospun fiber
contains high surface area with very small diameter which allocates
more mass transfer through the short diffusion pathway.20 Therefore, these factors could also induce the
release of pyocyanin. However, it is of interest that the longer sustainable
release of pyocyanin after 40 h could be a desirable feature for the
antibacterial material.

PUDP mat as a function
of time.

5.7 Antibacterial
Activity
5.7.1 Quantitative and Qualitative Analyses
The antibacterial activity was examined by immersing the PU, PUD,
and PUDP membrane into the S. aureus or E. coli suspension. The count
of viable cells was measured as a function of time via observation,
and Figure 4a,b shows
the corresponding results. It can be seen that there is no significant
loss in the number of viable bacterial cells with pristine PU and
PUD samples, whereas a significant decrease in the number of viable
cells can be found with the PUDP sample, representing the antibacterial
activity of pyocyanin. Further, the antibacterial activity of pristine
PU, PUD, and PUDP samples was further assessed by calculating the
percentage of bacterial inhibition after 12 h of time and represented
in Figure 4c,d. The
% of bacterial inhibition for the PUDP sample was found to be 98.54
and 90.2% for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. The lower count of viable
cells and higher % of bacterial inhibition with the hybrid electrospun
mat sample are a clear manifestation of higher antibacterial activity
of the hybrid electrospun mat containing pyocyanin. Because the deterioration
of S. aureus is delayed by the thick
peptidoglycan layer of its cell wall, the viable cell number of S. aureus increases in relation to the E. coli. The PUDP sample exhibited lower count of
viable cells for E. coli and slightly
higher count of viable cells for S. aureus. The antibacterial activity of prepared electrospun mat samples
was further investigated by a disk diffusion method on the solid medium,
as shown in Figure 5. Pristine PU and PUD nanofibers did not show activity, whereas the
electrospun mat containing pyocyanin showed clear ZOI. The inhibition
zone is slightly bigger for E. coli compared to the S. aureus plate,
which is due to different cell membrane structures of both bacteria.
The mean diameter of the inhibition zone for E. coli and S. aureus was around 22 ±
1.02 and 20.5 ± 1.17 mm, respectively. These results demonstrate
that the pyocyanin-loaded electrospun fiber showed excellent antibacterial
efficiency qualitatively against both S. aureus and E. coli. It is hypothesized that
pyocyanin is a bioactive phenazine molecule which interacts with the
bacterial cell membrane thereby interrupting the active metabolic
transport process of bacteria.41 Besides,
the pyocyanin has high tendency to produce O2× and H2O2 via
a nonenzymatic self-reduction and consequently destroy the cell membrane
by oxidative stress.6Table 1 lists the antibacterial activity
results of various bioactive antimicrobial agent-based electrospun
reported in the literature for comparison with the present study.

5.7.2 Mechanism of Cell Death Induced by Physical
Contact of PUDP Nanofibers with the Bacterial Surface
The
morphological images of pristine PU, PUD, and PUDP electrospun mats
were examined after antibacterial activity treatment for 12 h (Scheme 1). Figure 6a–c shows all obtained
images for S. aureus bacteria. Compared
with pristine PU and PUD, the PUDP electrospun mat shows highly distributed S. aureus bacteria on its surface. The shape of S. aureus remained intact after 12 h contact with
pristine PU and PUD mats. However, the shape of S.
aureus was deformed (shrinkage and irregular shape
of cells) significantly after 12 h contact with the PUDP fiber mat.
In the case of pristine PU and PUD, S. aureus was distributed in between fibers rather than being located only
on the surface. In contrast, S. aureus was entrapped only on the surface in the PUDP case, owing to the
dense and defect-free morphology caused by the incorporation of pyocyanin. Figure 6d–f shows
all obtained images for E. coli bacteria.
It can be seen that numerous distinguishable E. coli cells were distributed over the surface of pristine PU, PUD, and
PUDP fibers. The morphology of E. coli remains intact after 12 h contact with pristine PU and PUD fiber
mats (Figure 6a,b),
whereas the morphology of damaged cells of E. coli can be found after 12 h contact with the PUDP fiber mat surface,
representing that pyocyanin penetration causes shrinkage and deformation
of cells. In the case of E. coli, the
number of disrupted cells is more, whereas relatively lower number
of disrupted cells is observed for Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus. It is noteworthy to mention that the difference
in the thickness of the peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria could be the reason for this variation. Altogether, the presence
of pyocyanin enables the electrospun mat to be well suited for antibacterial
applications. It was reported that the interaction of pyocyanin with
the cell membrane causes the inhibition of bacterial growth.42

5.7.3 Detection of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen
Radicals
Pyocyanin is a redox-active phenazine that can produce
ROS after diffusing into the bacterial cell membrane from the electrospun
mat. The intracellular ROS formation from PUDP-treated cells was evaluated
by using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe (DCFH-DA). DCFH-DA
is a nonfluorescence intracellular ROS indicator which diffuses into
cells and oxidizes to highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
(DCF) using ROS.9 It can be found that
the PUDP-treated bacteria became DCF+ and exhibit high-fluorescence
intensity, which is due to the intracellular ROS formation caused
by pyocyanin (Figure 7). In contrast, pristine PU- and PUD-treated cells have no fluorescent
DCF+ because of the absence of pyocyanin. The fluorescence
intensity and the number of DCF+ cells were found to be
higher for E. coli with respect to S. aureus, which is owing to the rapid degradation
of E. coli caused by more exposed surface
for pyocyanin penetration. The fluorescence intensity depends on the
amount of intracellular ROS production.9 Upon obtained results, it is assumed that burst release of pyocyanin
after immersing into the bacterial solution induces its diffusion
to the cell membrane and stimulates oxidative stress via ROS.6 This postulated hypothesis is summarized in Scheme 3.

5.7.4 Determination
of Apoptosis
Oxidative
stress of the electrospun mat is a crucial parameter which is necessary
to be high to determine the effective apoptosis process. Apoptosis
is a programmed cell death which can be induced through intracellular
apoptotic effector molecules such as ROS. Thus, the apoptosis of bacterial
cells was determined quantitatively by using Annexin V-FITC/PI-stain. Figure 8 shows the corresponding
results. The PUDP mat exhibited the late bacterial apoptosis of 89.6
and 83.42% toward E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. The % of early apoptosis
was 0.32 for E. coli and 6.92 for S. aureus. Nevertheless, the significant apoptosis
was not found for pristine PU and PUD mats toward both bacteria cells.
The PUDP mat induces the apoptosis process via ROS provided by the
bioactive compound (i.e., pyocyanin). Previously, it has been reported
that apoptosis can be characterized in prokaryotic cells through (i)
cell morphology, (ii) cell shrinkage, (iii) DNA fragmentation, and
(iv) DNA condensation.43 It can be seen
that the obtained apoptosis results are consistent with other above-mentioned
findings. Dwyer et al. reported that apoptosis induction takes place
in response to ROS generation.44 The contribution
of pyocyanin for the generation of ROS in bacterial cells through
oxidative stress has been well described by Rada et al.45 Although various pyocyanin-based apoptosis were
reported, a complete realization and detailed explanation on the electrospun
mat-based apoptosis have rarely been investigated.5,46 It
is hypothesized that the vigorous release of pyocyanin from PUDP mats
possibly induced the apoptosis in both bacteria. Therefore, PUDP mats
can be used as a local treatment or disinfectant wiping purpose.

binding after (a–c) E. coli and

6 Conclusions
In the
present study, a bioactive compound (i.e., pyocyanin) incorporated
the hybrid membrane was successfully prepared through electrospinning,
and their applications toward antimicrobial activity were investigated.
A slightly twisted bead-free cylindrical fiber morphology was observed
after incorporation of pyocyanin, whereas the pristine and dextran
mixed fiber exhibited a flat ribbon-like structure. A more hydrophilic
electrospun membrane was obtained after the addition of pyocyanin.
The hybrid electrospun showed an initial burst release of 60–80%
over the time of 20 h, which represent the effectual release profile
of bioactive molecules. The PUDP mat showed the antimicrobial activity
of 98.54 and 90.2% against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively, demonstrating the cytotoxic
behavior of the hybrid membrane. The higher ZOI clearly depicted the
bacterial efficiency of the hybrid electrospun mat. The morphology
of bacteria after being adsorbed on PUDP mats was examined by FE-SEM,
and shrinkage and irregular shape of cells was observed throughout
the surface of mats. The apoptotic cell determination on the PUDP
mat exhibited the late bacterial apoptosis of 89.6 and 83.42% toward E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Altogether, the present results showed that pyocyanin-mixed
electrospun mats can be applied as an antibacterial material in various
applications such as household disinfectant product, textiles, and
food industries.
