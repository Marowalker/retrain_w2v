The calcination temperature plays a significant role in the structural,
textural, and energy-storage performance of metal oxide nanomaterials
in Li-ion battery application. Here, we report the formation of well-crystallized
homogeneously dispersed Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microsphere architectures
through a simple cost-effective coprecipitation and chemical mixing
route without surface modification for improving the efficiency of
energy storage devices. The synthesized Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microsphere
cathode materials are calcined at 800, 900, 950, and 1000 °C.
Among them, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 calcined at 950 °C exhibits a high discharge
capacity (277 mAh g–1 at 0.1C rate) and excellent
capacity retention (88%) after 50 cycles and also delivers an excellent
discharge capacity of >172 mAh g–1 at 5C rate. Good
electrochemical performance of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2-950 is directly related
to the optimized size of its primary particles (85 nm) (which constitute
the spherical secondary particle, ∼720 nm) and homogeneous
cation mixing. Higher calcination temperature (≥950 °C)
leads to an increase of the primary particle size, poor cycling stability,
and inferior rate capacity of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 due to smashing of quasi-hollow
spheres upon repeated lithium ion intercalations/deintercalations.
Therefore, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2-950 is a promising electrode for the next-generation
high-voltage and high-capacity Li-ion battery application.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The drastic production of greenhouse gases resulting from the widespread
use of fossil fuels has been attracting considerable attention worldwide.
To solve these problems, alternative energy resources and/or the robust
energy storage systems are crucially needed in the current stage.
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have found a prominent place in the energy
storage systems, particularly in the electric vehicles, hybrid electric
vehicles, and large-scale grid-based electrical energy storage systems.1−3 However, the commercially available cathode materials, such as layered
(LiCoO2, LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2), spinel (LiMn2O4, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4), and olivine (LiFePO4),
cannot fully satisfy the current demands such as high energy density
and low cost. In this direction, Li-rich layered oxides Li2MnO3–LiMO2 (M = Co, Ni, and Mn) are
promising cathode materials, owing to their high capacity, enhanced
cyclic stability, and low cost.4−8 The high voltage plateau (4.5 V) of LiMn2O3 and LixMnO2 formation along
the electrochemical phenomenon is attributed to the activation of
LiMn2O3, which is responsible for its excellent
discharge capacity above 250 mAh g–1.9,10 However, some disadvantages still need to be overcome before the
practical applications in LIBs such as tap density, low initial Columbic
efficiency, poor high-rate performance, and cycling capacity fading.11

To date, significant effort has been dedicated to improve the electrochemical
performance of the Li- and Mn-rich layered cathode materials by surface
modification,12,13 lattice doping,14 and tuning the material composition.15 Moreover, the synthetic conditions, such as coprecipitation,16,17 lithium content,18,19 particle size,20 calcination temperature,21 calcination
atmosphere (O2, air, etc.), and heating and cooling rates22,23 are also varied to examine the electrochemical performance of Li-
and Mn-rich layered cathode materials. Furthermore, it has been confirmed
that some electrode materials based on nano/sub-micro architecture
morphologies, such as nanoplates24 and
nanosheets,25 are greatly helpful to the
enhancement of high-rate capabilities of Li-ion cathode materials.
In addition, hollow or porous microparticles of cathode materials
have been reported for the improvement of electrochemical performance.26,27 The cavities present in the hollow microparticles could provide
more active sites for Li+ ion storage, which is beneficial
for increasing the reversible capacity. In this microstructure, the
secondary hollow nano/sub-micron-sized particles consist of nanosized
primary particles and possess a larger surface area. The larger surface
area and mesoporous nature of the electrodes provide more Li ion diffusion
access to the electrolyte, attributed to the improvement of high-rate
capability. Finally, the void space in the hollow nano/sub-microsphere
particles could offer an extra space for volume expansion/contraction
in the process of Li+ intercalations/deintercalations,
which could facilitate the improvement of electrochemical performances.28−32

Considering the advantage of cost-effective and simplified preparation,
the coprecipitation route would be of great interest. The coprecipitation
method is applicable for the direct control of the particle nano/sub-microstructure,
size, and shape. In this work, we demonstrated the Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (LMNCO)
hollow nano/sub-microsphere preparation using a MnO2 hollow
nanosphere template. The effect of calcination temperature on the
primary nanoparticle size, cation mixing, and electrochemical performance
of a Li- and Mn-rich cathode material Li-ion cell (LMNCO), with a
large secondary particle size, required for reaching a high volumetric
density, is evaluated. The Li-ion cell with LMNCO material calcined
at different temperatures (800–1000 °C) was cycled with
a high cutoff voltage of 4.8 V; LMNCO-950 showed significantly improved
performance and thus the Li- and Mn-rich cathode materials can be
adopted for high-capacity and high-voltage LIB applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Material Characterization
Figure S1 displays the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of MnCO3 nanospheres (a and b) and MnO2 hollow nano/sub-microspheres (c and d) at different magnifications.
Legibly, MnCO3 solid spheres prepared by the coprecipitation
method are seen (400–550 nm) and employed as a self-template,
and MnCO3 nanospheres are converted into MnO2 hollow spheres by thermal decomposition at 350 °C. The α-MnO2 hollow nano/sub-microsphere template precursors show relatively
uniform sizes, about 400–600 nm, with a hollow nano/sub-microsphere
morphology. We observed the hollow morphology of secondary particles;
according to the Kirkendall effect, during the calcination process,
the metal atoms rapidly diffuse outward and the opposite O atom slowly
diffuse inward, which leads to the formation of the hollow MnO2 precursor; moreover, the CO32– ion decomposition is also involved in the hollow structure formation
process. The thermal decomposition of the MnO2 hollow nano/sub-microsphere
precursor with Ni, Co, and Li source salts and the formation of Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 (LMNCO) hollow nano/sub-microspheres were measured by thermogravimetric
analysis/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA) and are presented
in Figure S2. There were three major weight
losses found in the temperature range from 25 to 1000 °C. The
first weight loss was measured to be 7% (25–180 °C), which
can be attributed to the loss of hygroscopic nature and coordination-bonded
water molecules. The second drastic weight loss from 180 to 400 °C
was ascribed to the thermal decomposition of nitrates of Ni, Co, and
LiOH along with interstitial H2O. The third weight loss
region at 350–652 °C may be due to the complete elimination
of organic moieties and unwanted gaseous matter along with structural
re-orientation. The reaction between transition metal oxides and Li
salts occurs below 800 °C, and the formation of a Li-rich structure
is accomplished above 800 °C.7,35 Finally, there
was no considerable weight loss found beyond 800 °C temperature,
and it can be interpreted that the Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microsphere
samples were stable at a higher temperature. Hence, the effect of
various calcination temperatures on the electrochemical performances
was evaluated using the Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microspheres samples
calcinated at 800, 900, 950, and 1000 °C.

The influence
of calcination temperature on the morphology has been investigated
and presented in Figure 1, which shows SEM images of LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microspheres (630–730
nm) formed by several 70–95 nm polyhedral smooth-edged primary
nanoparticles. The primary LMNCO particle size gradually increases
from 70 to 95 nm when the calcination temperature increases from 800
to 1000 °C, as shown in Table S1.
However, there is no change in the morphology of secondary particles,
but the primary particles are loosened on increasing the temperature.
The SEM-energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental maps for LMNCO-950
samples were made to verify the distribution of the transition (Mn,
Ni, Co, and O) metals and are shown in Figure S3c–f. The LMNCO-950 sample confirms the homogeneous
distribution of the transition metal and reiterated in the SEM-EDX
spectrum shown in Figure S3a. Each secondary
particle analogous spherical morphology with a nano/sub-microspheres
and we can observe porous on the surface of the secondary particles
which are formed by the CO2 escape during the MnCO3 calcinations, the porosity can offer good electrolyte percolation.
However, the LMNCO-1000 sample shows that the primary particles are
more adhesive to other primary particles, which is not beneficial
to the Li ion diffusion and electrolyte percolation.33 Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of the LMNCO-950
sample are presented in Figure 2a–d. The spherical morphology with a hollow structure
can be clearly observed, consistent with the SEM images. Figure 2c shows the typical
bright-field high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image taken for the edge
of a single primary nanoparticle, and the size is 84 nm. Figure 2d shows the edge
of a single primary nanoparticle, demonstrating that the lattice distance
of 4.6 Å agrees well with not only the {003} lattice spacing
of the rhombohedral phase of LMO2 (M = Ni, Co, Mn) but
also the (001) planes for monoclinic Li2MnO3.

f), and LMNCO-1000 (g, h) hollow nano/sub-microspheres at low and
high magnifications.

(g) LMNCO-950, and (h) LMNCO-1000 hollow nano/sub-microspheres.

The calcination temperature appears to significantly affect the
surface area, pore volume, and pore size of the porous materials (Table S1). Figure S4a shows the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the as-prepared
samples at different calcination temperatures, namely, LMNCO-800,
LMNCO-900, LMNCo-950, and LMNCO-1000 hollow nano/sub-microspheres.
All the samples show type IV isotherms with the H3-type hysteresis
loop according to IUPAC classification, which is the characteristic
of a mesoporous material. In addition, we observed a drastic reduction
of surface area from 27.252 to 3.301 m2 g–1, when the calcination temperature of the LMNCO sample increased
from 800 to 1000 °C. The subsequent decrease of pore volume (from
0.0315 to 0.0111 cm3 g–1) and surface
area upon thermal treatment at a higher temperature could be due to
the increase of primary and secondary particle sizes of LMNCO samples.
Indeed, the corresponding pore size distribution of LMNCO calcined
materials was calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method and plotted (Figure S4b), and materials
exhibited an increase in the mesopore width from 11.392 to 40.743
nm due to the loosely bonded primary particles. The porous structure
of LMNCO is also confirmed by SEM and TEM characterization, as shown
in Figures 1a–h
and 2a–d, respectively. These nano/micro
mesoporous structures could effectively shorten the Li+ ion migration path, reduce the volume change during the charge–discharge
cycling, and increase the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte,
beneficial for the cycling performance.

The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized MnCO3 nano/sub-microsphere
precursor can be indexed to the pure rhombohedral phase of MnCO3 (JCPDS card no. 44-1472),34 and
the spectra are presented in Figure S5a. The MnCO3 microspheres decomposed into hollow MnO2 by thermal treatment at 350 °C for 5 h. The XRD pattern
shown in Figure S5b indicates the formation
of a tetragonal phase of the MnO2 hollow nano/sub-microspheres
(JCPDS card no. 24-0735).35 The LMNCO hollow
nano/sub-microspheres are synthesized at various calcination temperatures,
and their impact on the crystallinity and phase purity is shown in Figure S6, and the Rietveld refinement fitting
of the observed LMNCO peak, calculated peak, and their difference
profile is presented in Figure 2e–h. The lattice parameters were calculated α-NaFeO2 using XRD analysis software (TOPAS 4.1) shown in Table 1. All peaks are corresponding
to a trigonal structure with the R3̅m space group. The I(003)/I(104) ratio has been used as an indicator of
cation mixing, that is, values higher than 1.2 indicate a high degree
of cation mixing, due to the occupancy by other ions in the lithium
interslab regions, and the reversible capacity of the cathode materials
tends to decrease when the ratio is less than 1.2. In this work, the
LMNCO-800 sample shows the highest I(003)/I(104) ratio of 1.843, indicating that
this sample has the lowest amount of cation mixing. However, as the
calcination temperature increases to 950 °C, the ratio I(003)/I(104) decreases
dramatically, indicating that the LMNCO-950 sample has high degree
of cation mixing. Further increase of calcination temperature to 1000
°C creates more Li/Mn cation mixing with enhanced crystallinity,
which could be attributed to an increase of oxygen vacancies at high
temperatues.21,36,37 Moreover, the diffraction peak in the 2θ range of 20–25°
is for the alternate arrangement of Li+ and Mn4+ ions in the transition metal layers and the existence of a monoclinic
crystal structure of Li2MnO3 (space group, C2/m).11,38,39

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed
to gain more chemical insight into transition metal ions in the LMNCO-950
samples, and their corresponding spectra are shown in Figure 3. Initially, the binding energies
are calibrated by referring the C 1s line to 284.6 eV. The XPS survey
spectrum (Figure 3a)
exhibits the existence of Li, Ni, Co, Mn, O, and C (reference specimen)
without the presence of any impurities. Further, it can be clearly
noted that there are four signals for both Ni 2p and Co 2p with two
main peaks and two corresponding satellite peaks in the LMNCO-950
hollow nano/sub-microsphere samples using the Gaussian fitting method.
However, the Mn 2p spectrum (Figure 3b) shows a pair of main spin–orbit lines at
about 642.3 eV for Mn 2p3/2 and 654.2 eV for Mn 2p1/2, with a separation of 11.5 eV, which indicates that the
majority of Mn is in the Mn4+ state in LMNCO as in the
case of previously published lithium-rich cathode materials.38−42 In detail, the Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 3c) shows a sharp Ni 2p3/2 peak
located at 855.2 eV and Ni 2p1/2 peak at about 873.1 eV
with a separation of 17.9 eV, which are the characteristic peaks for
the Ni2+cation. Further, two mild prominent peaks with
binding energies of 858.2 and 876.5 eV are observed, indicating that
the Ni ions are in a +2 oxidation state. Figure 3d shows the Co 2p spectrum, which reveals
two major peaks at around 780.1 and 795.3 eV with a spin–orbit
splitting of 15.2 eV, which can be ascribed to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks, respectively, indicating the coexistence
of Co2+. Two satellite peaks are detected at about 790.1
and 805.2 eV related to the fingerprint of Co3+ cations.38−42 Thus, it can be concluded that the well-formed LMNCO-950 cathode
materials with hollow nano/sub-microspheres have been successfully
prepared through our designed coprecipitation and chemical mixing
method.

2.2 Electrochemical Properties
To evaluate
the influence of calcination temperature on the electrochemical performance
of LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microspheres, cyclic voltammograms (CVs)
were performed at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 between
2.0 and 4.8 V with 2032 coin-type cells shown in Figure 4. The Li- and Mn-rich LMNCO
electrode materials exhibit two main oxidation peaks in the first
cycles at around 4.0–4.2 V corresponding to the reversible
oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni4+ and Co3+ to Co4+ on extraction of Li+ ions from the
LiMO2 (M = Ni, Co) layered structure. On the other hand,
the second oxidation peak appearing at around 4.6–4.7 V is
due to the irreversible extraction of Li+ ions from the
Li2MnO3 component, resulting in Li2O formation through the oxygen activation.11,43 Furthermore, all of the LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microsphere samples
show three distinguishable reduction peaks at around 4.3, 3.7, and
3.2 V. The first two peaks are ascribed to the reduction of Ni4+ and Co4+, while another peak at around 3.2 V
is related to the Mn4+ reduction for balancing the charge
of oxygen vacancies arising from the loss of oxygen during the first
cycles. However, the sharp oxidation peak present in the first cycles
appearing at around 4.6–4.7 V in all of the samples depletes
in the second cycle due to the stabilization of the Li2MnO3 compounds. Meanwhile, the oxidation peak appearing
at 4.08–4.17 V is shifted to the 3.8–4.08 V range; this
is due to electrochemical polarization.44 Significantly, the LMNCO-950 hollow nano/sub-microspheres show the
irreversible oxidation peak at 4.7 V, which is relatively higher than
the potential shows the other three LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microspheres
electrodes is less even at the higher temperature calcined material,
suggesting an improvement in the oxygen loss and decomposition of
the electrolyte. Furthermore, the subsequent CV curves of the LMNCO-950
sample reveal better reversible and higher electrochemical properties
due to the degree of symmetry associated with the shape of redox peaks.
Thus, the sample LMNCO-950 possesses excellent structural stability
and shows favorable cycle performances.

(c) LMNCO-950, and (d) LMNCO-1000 hollow nano/sub-microspheres at
a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge performance of LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microspheres
was examined between 2.0 and 4.8 V at 0.1 C (27 mA g–1) for 50 cycles and is plotted in Figure 5. The first charging profiles were in good
agreement with those of other reported Li- and Mn-rich LMNCO cathodes.9,11−13,45−47 All the samples exhibited two plateau regions in the first charging
profiles: first plateau is up to 4.5 V, and the second plateau is
between 4.5 and 4.8 V. It is generally accepted that Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 electrodes
are charged in two steps with different mechanisms during the initial
charging process. This behavior can be explained as follows.

Figure 5 Charge/discharge curves of (a) LMNCO-800, (b) LMNCO-900, (c) LMNCO-950,
and (d) LMNCO-1000 hollow nano/sub-microspheres at a 0.1C rate (27
mA g–1).

2.2.1 Charging Process
 1  

 2  

As described in the reaction, the two plateau regions belong to xLi2MnO3(1.2 – 2x) and LMO2, which is confirmed through the XRD results
where the Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microspheres are recognized
as a mixture of trigonal (R3̅m) and monoclinic (C2/m) structures.

2.2.2 Discharging Process
 3  

The first chemical reaction, eq 1, explains the charging
reaction where delithiation takes place below 4.5 V corresponding
to the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni4+ and Co3+ to Co4+, and the second charging reaction, eq 2, occurs between 4.5 and
4.8 V, attributed to the irreversible oxygen loss from the Li2MnO3 component with the removal of Li2O in the first irreversible charging process. During the discharge
chemical reaction (eq 3), lithiation occurs at >3.0 V and the discharge plateau decreased
sharply below 3.0 V, where the reduction of Ni4+, Co4+, and Mn4+ ions occurs and forms the original
state of the Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 electrode material. The first cycle discharge
capacity is higher than that from the next consequent cycles owing
to the fact that the electrochemical behavior of the Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 electrode
is getting stabilized and it exercises non-electrochemical processes
at ≤3.0 V; thus, lowered capacity retention than in the first
cycles was observed. All the LMNCO electrode materials revealed the
large irreversible capacity loss (Table S2) mainly due to the elimination of the oxygen ion vacancies and the
lithium ion sites as well as side reactions with the electrolyte at
the high operating voltage over 4.5 V.9,11−13,35,45−47 Interestingly, all the LMNCO electrode materials
showed remarkably higher charge/discharge capacities than the other
reported conventional cathode materials (e.g., LiCoO2,
LiFePO4, and LiMn2O4),48−50 which is an important characteristic property of high-energy-density
LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microsphere electrodes. The discharge capacity
retention values of LMNCO-800, LMNCO-900, LMNCO-950, and LMNCO-1000
electrodes after 50 cycles were 81, 80, 87, and 85%, respectively,
which are best among the previous reports, shown in Table 2. The Coulombic efficiencies
have a great influence on the possible applications of Li- and Mn-rich
layered cathode materials. Generally, the nanoparticle electrode shows
a high surface area and increased electrode/electrolyte interface
provokes the risk of severe side reactions including decomposition
of electrolytes and consumption of lithium. In the present synthesized
LMNCO secondary particles, the electrode/electrolyte contact surface
area is higher, but the fouling and the dissolution of electrode were
not found as inferred from the higher Coulombic efficiency. The specific
solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) area can be reduced significantly
with an electrolyte-blocking layer outside the assembled secondary
particles, which can help to defer the side reactions between the
electrolyte and the electrode and achieve excellent Coulombic efficiency.

To evaluate the high-rate capability of four LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microsphere
electrodes, the fabricated cells were tested at various rates ranging
from 0.2C (54 mA g–1) to 10C (2700 mA g–1). Figure 6a displays
the measured discharge capacitance of LMNCO-800, LMNCO-900, LMNCO-950,
and LMNCO-1000 hollow nano/sub-microspheres at different rate capabilities,
and the corresponding charge/discharge curves of LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microspheres
are presented in Figures 6b and S7a–c. The discharge
capacities of the LMNCO-950 hollow nano/sub-microsphere electrodes
were 229, 218, 211, 183, 173, 162, and 220 mAh g–1 at current rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 0.2C, respectively.
Notably, the electrode could still deliver a capacity of more than
160 mAh g–1 even at 10C, equivalent to as high as
71% of discharge capacity at 0.2C. Additionally, the discharge capacity
of LMNCO-950 is recovered to 220 mAh g–1 when the
discharge rate was dropped back down to 0.2C, which is close to its
initial discharge capacity under 0.2C rate. However, LMNCO-800, LMNCO-900,
and LMNCO-1000 samples show less high-rate performance, where the
discharge capacity at 10C rate dropped to 62, 65, and 62%, respectively,
when compared with the discharge capacity of the same samples at 0.2C
rate. The discharge capacities of all the LMNCO electrode materials
slowly decreased when increasing the discharge rate. However, the
LMNCO-950 hollow nano/sub-microsphere sample showed its superior electrochemical
performance.

hollow nano/sub-microspheres and (b) charge/discharge curves of LMNCO-950
at different C-rates.

Figure 7a–d
shows the electrochemical cycle performances of all the LMNCO hollow
nano/sub-microsphere electrodes at 1, 3, and 5C rates. The initial
discharge capacities of 186, 158, and 139 mAh g–1 (LMNCO-800); 202, 176, and 157 mAh g–1 (LMNCO-900);
212, 183, and 173 mAh g–1 (LMNCO-950); and 201,
176, and 150 mAh g–1 (LMNCO-1000) with capacity
retention values of 74, 70, and 55% (LMNCO-800); 89, 73, and 56% (LMNCO
-900); 93, 94, and 83% (LMNCO-950); and 91, 90, and 85% (LMNCO-1000)
after 200 cycles at 1, 3, and 5C, respectively, were obtained. All
the LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microsphere samples show the average Columbic
efficiency of 98%. It can be concluded that the LMNCO-950 hollow nano/sub-microsphere
electrode sample exhibits the highest initial discharge capacity,
good rate capability, and most stable cyclic performance, which may
be benefitted from its excellent structural integrity. Meanwhile,
the SEM and HR-TEM images of the LMNCO-950 electrode exhibit nanometer-sized
primary particles and increased the pore size supports for the excellent
electrochemical performance and the shorter diffusion distance of
Li+ ions helps in high-rate performance.

LMNCO-900, (c) LMNCO-950, and (d) LMNCO-1000 hollow nano/sub-microspheres
for 200 cycles at 1, 3, and 5C rates.

The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of all the LMNCO hollow
nano/sub-microspheres electrodes is recorded at the 1st cycle and
200th cycle and is presented in Figure 8a,b. Each plot consists of a depressed semicircle in
the high-frequency region and a straight line in the low-frequency
range. The impedance spectra can be explained using an equivalent
electric circuit shown in Figure S9, which
consists of the electrolyte resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct),
and Warburg impedance (Zw). Table S3 shows the specific data of each resistance.
As shown, the Rs and Rct values increase during the subsequent cycles. Furthermore,
after 200 cycles, the increase of the Rs and Rct values of LMNCO-950 is small,
indicating that the SEI film formation on LMNCO-950 is negligible.
The Li+ diffusion coefficient of the electrode has been
calculated by the following equations, eqs 4 and 5.51,52 4   5  where R is the gas constant
(8.314 J mol K), T is the absolute temperature (294
°C), A is the surface area of the cathode (1.3
cm2), n is the number of electrons per
molecule during oxidation, F is the Faraday constant
(96 485 C mol–1), C is the
concentration of lithium ion, and B is the Warburg
coefficient associated with the slope of linear fittings between Z′ and the reciprocal square root of the angular
frequency in the low-frequency region, as shown in Figure 8c,d. The calculated values
of the lithium ion diffusion coefficient are listed in Table S3. The Li+ diffusion coefficient
of LMNCO-950 (200th cycle) is much higher than that of the other three
samples, as shown in Figure 8d, while the LMNCO-950 electrode still presents the lowest
values of Rs and Rct and excellent Li-ion diffusion coefficient, indicating that
the LMNCO-950 cathode still possesses relatively stable material interfaces
even after long-term cycling performances without any disintegration.

low-frequency region of (c) 1st cycle and (d) 200th cycle for LMNCO
hollow nano/sub-microsphere electrodes.

To further understand the Li-ion storage performance in Li- and
Mn-rich LMNCO-950 hollow nano/sub-microspheres, coin cells were initially
activated with three cycles (2.0–4.8 V); after that, the cells
were evaluated at different cutoff voltages (2.0–4.8, 2.0–4.7,
2.0–4.6, and 2.0–4.5 V) at 0.1C rate, and the discharge
capacities were 273, 252, 227, and 201 mAh g–1,
respectively, in the first cycles (Figure S8a–d). The discharge capacity of LMNCO-950 decreased with decreasing
cutoff voltage. However, the cyclic stability of the LMNCO-950 sample
at different cutoff voltages was examined (4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8
V) at 1C rate for 200 cycles. The initial discharge capacities were
obtained as 211, 205, 199, and 175 mAh g–1 at 4.8,
4.7, 4.6, and 4.5 V cutoff voltages at 1C rate, respectively; then,
they gradually reduced on further cycling process. After 200 cycles,
the capacity retention values were measured to be 93, 75, 83, and
89% for 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, and 4.5 V cutoff voltages, respectively (Figure S8e). On comparing all the cutoff voltage
capacity retention after the 200th cycle, a higher capacity retention
was observed for the 4.5 V cutoff voltage, which may be due to the
excellent electroactive behavior of LMO2 compounds. However,
on increasing the cutoff voltage, the partial involvement of Li2MnO3 hinders the Li ion movements in the topotactical
reactions, resulting in reduced capacity retention. In contrast to
this, further, at a higher cutoff voltage of 4.8 V, Li2MnO3 and LMO2 got involved in the host–guest
process completely, resulting in a significantly improved performance
of 197 mAh g–1 discharge capacity after the 200th
cycle. Overall, the cyclic stability of prepared LMNCO-950 electrode
materials coulomb efficiency is ≥98% in all the cutoff voltages,
due to the higher pore size, higher surface area and nanoparticles
are increased the electrode/electrolyte interaction. We have observed
that our LMNCO-950 electrode materials have a higher cutoff voltage,
superior rate capability, and excellent capacity retention than the
commercially available cathodes.

To examine more detail the interfacial phenomenon of the LMNCO-950
electrode at different cutoff voltages, the EIS measurements were
carried out after three charge–discharge cycles (Figure S9a,b), and the Nyquist plots showed that
the cutoff voltages did not show any effect on the solution resistance
(Rs). However, the charge transfer resistance
(Rct) significantly lowered for the cutoff
voltage of 4.8 V (39.18 Ω) and 4.5 V (63.16 Ω), whereas
it was higher for 4.6 V (76.99 Ω) and 4.7 V (79.67 Ω).
The obtained Rs and Rct and calculated DLi+ values
are summarized in Table S4. These results
clearly indicate that the partially participating Li2MnO3 phase leads to a slower Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation
process, which results in a reduced capacity retention at different
cutoff voltages. In general, the capacity retention of all LMNCO electrodes
at different cutoff voltages shows good electrochemical performances.

3 Conclusions
Li- and Mn-rich layered cathode materials, i.e., Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2,
have been prepared at various calcination temperatures, and their
structural and morphological properties and electrochemical performances
at high cutoff voltages (2.0–4.8 V) have been systematically
investigated. The results demonstrated that the electrochemical performance
of the Li- and Mn-rich LMNCO cathode is optimized with respect to
the calcination temperature and the primary particle size. An unsurpassed
electrochemical performance of the LMNCO-950 electrode is achieved
with an excellent discharge capacity of 277 mAh g–1 at 0.1C rate, and it is capable of delivering the capacity above
173 mAh–1 at 5C rate and retention capacity of 82%
of its initial capacity even after 200 cycles. On the other hand,
increasing the calcination temperature (LMNCO-1000) leads to inferior
long-term cycling stability and rate capability because of smashed
quasi-hollow spheres and broken formation upon Li+ deintercalation/intercalation
that is closely related to the large primary nanoparticles in the
electrode. These outcomes have highlighted the importance of optimizing
the calcination temperature for preparing the Li- and Mn-rich hollow
sphere electrodes. Besides, the optimization of calcination temperatures
and primary and secondary particle sizes would depend on the compositions
of the Li- and Mn-rich cathode materials; therefore, such parameters
need to be carefully considered while tailoring the Li- and Mn-rich
cathode materials to enhance their electrochemical performances. The
Li- and Mn-rich LMNCO-950 electrode is an excellent alternate to the
existing commercially available LMNC oxide cathode materials for high-energy
lithium-ion batteries.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of LMNCO Hollow Nano/Sub-Microspheres
The target product (Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) was synthesized using the coprecipitation
approach as it has been widely used in the synthesis of hollow nano/sub-microspheres
and is a cost-effective method. Scheme 1 is derived based on the synthesis process of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microspheres. Initially, the MnO2 hollow nanosphere template was synthesized by the following process:
400 mL of 0.01 M MnSO4 was taken in a 1000 mL round-bottom
flask and 400 mL of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate was added slowly into
the MnSO4 solution. Stirring was continued for 2 h, and
then, the MnCO3 nanospheres were separated by centrifugation
and washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove the impurities.
The separated MnCO3 nanospheres were dried at 120 °C
for 12 h and decomposed at 350 °C for 5 h to obtain MnO2 hollow nanospheres by elimination of CO2. The MnO2 hollow nanospheres and the stoichiometric amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and LiOH·H2O were dispersed
in ethanol. The above added compounds were allowed to react with MnO2 hollow nanospheres and evaporated at room temperature. To
observe the influence of calcination temperature on the morphology
and physicochemical and electrochemical properties of LMNCO hollow
nano/sub-microspheres, the formed nanospheres were calcined at different
temperatures: 800 °C (LMNCO-800), 900 °C (LMNCO-900), 950
°C (LMNCO-950), and 1000 °C (LMNCO-1000) for 10 h.

4.2 Structure and Morphological Characterization
The crystallinity and phase purity of the synthesized LMNCO hollow
nano/sub-microsphere samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Bruker-D8 advance) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406
Å) at 40 kV/25 mA at a scan rate of 0.06° s–1 with a 2θ angle from 10 to 70. The morphology and particle
size were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8010)
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Tecnai
G2). Surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the synthesized LMNCO
hollow nano/sub-microspheres were analyzed using the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm method by a monosorb surface area analyzer (Quantachrome,
Autosorb-6B). The XPS spectra were obtained using a PHI spectrometer
(Perkin-Elmer, American) with monochromatic Mg radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV) for LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microspheres.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical performances of the LMNCO hollow nano/sub-microsphere
electrodes were tested in a CR2032 coin cell in half-cell LIB. The
preparation of a positive electrode is as follows: 80 wt % active
material, 10 wt % super P, and 10 wt % poly(vinylidene fluoride) were
dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The slurry was
coated on the aluminum foil and dried at 120 °C overnight in
a vacuum oven. Then, the dried electrode sheet was cut into small
disks of about 13 mm. The active material loading mass is ∼3.7
mg cm–2. A lithium metal piece was used as a reference
and counter electrode. A microporous polypropylene film was selected
as a separator and soaked in the electrolytic solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (VEC/VDMC = 1:1). Finally, the
assembly of coin cell (CR2032) was made in an argon-filled glow box
with H2O and O2 concentrations below 1 ppm.
The galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed on
the Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat instrument in a voltage range
from 2.0 to 4.8 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
measurements were carried out on the Autolab PGSTAT-30 (Eco Chemie
B.V., Netherlands) electrochemical workstation in the frequency range
from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with the alternate current voltage amplitude
of 5 mV.
