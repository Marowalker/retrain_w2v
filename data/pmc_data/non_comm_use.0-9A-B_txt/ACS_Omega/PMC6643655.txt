White-light-emitting diodes are energy
efficiency replacement of
conventional lighting sources. Herein, we report the luminescent behavior
of three simple cyanostilbenes with triphenylamine-donating groups
bearing different electron-withdrawing groups (phenyl, pyridyl, and p-nitrophenyl) in a common donor (D)−π–acceptor
(A) α-cyanostilbene construct along with their thermal and electrochemical
properties. The density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that
aggregation-induced emission characteristic feature of the D−π–A
dyes is inversely proportional to the intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) effect, that is, phenyl-and pyridyl-substituted compounds show
characteristic aggregation-induced emission in water, whereas the
ICT effect is dominant for the nitro derivative. The extent of ICT
and the solvatochromic emission shifts, from blue to red, depend on
the strength of the electron-withdrawing group. White luminescence
and tunable emission colors are obtained by careful admixtures of
these cyanostilbenes bearing triphenylamines. The results rationalized
through DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations follow a consistent
trend with the energy levels measured from the electrochemical and
optical studies. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning
calorimetry studies showed excellent thermal stability of the compounds.
The scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements
were performed to reveal the formation of aggregates. This strategy
involving synthetically simple and structurally similar molecules
with different emission properties has potential applications in the
fabrication of multicolor and white-light-emitting materials.

Introduction
Organic materials emitting
white light have attracted significant
attention for their potential applicability in lighting devices and
for efficient energy utilization.1,2 In general,
the white light emission is obtained by blending of two or more complementary
colors that cover the full spectrum of visible wavelength ranging
from 400 to 700 nm.3−7 Traditionally, the white light emission has been achieved with the
use of single chromophoric systems,8 self-assembly,9,10 complexation with macrocyclic hosts,11 supramolecular gelation12,13 or through the use
of natural pigments from vegetable extracts,14,15 and related processes.16−18 A scaffold with suitable electronic
push–pull substituents separated by a π-spacer is prevalent
in the organic dyes exhibiting strong emission or color characteristics.
Such molecular materials with electron-donating and electron-accepting
substituents connected through conjugated π-electrons (D−π–A)
have been extensively investigated because of their abundant applications
for organic electronic  and biological applications.17,19−25 Among many known derivatives, there is an active interest toward
materials exhibiting unique aggregation-induced emission (AIE or
AIEE) for their excellent emissive properties in the solid or aggregated
state due to restricted molecular rotations with subsequent reduction
of radiationless decay processes.26−29 α-Cyanostilbenes belongs
to one such class of π-conjugated substrates that exhibit this
unique emission behavior and were widely utilized for optical and
biological applications.30−35 Cyanostilbenes are considered to be an attractive platform  as
different chemical entities can be synthetically incorporated
in the core structure in the form of the donor (D) or acceptor (A)
groups  and other functional moieties via routine synthetic
procedures.36 Self-assemblies, nanostructures,
supramolecular complexes, fluorescent probes, sensors, supramolecular
materials, and several other functional materials with cyanostilbene
core have been investigated by taking advantage of this synthetic
tunability.37−40 Previously, derivatives based on tetraphenylethylene, a well-known
AIE substrate, is shown to emit white light in the presence of a suitable
polymer host or dopant.41−43 Although cyanostilbenes have
also been explored as excellent optoelectronic materials, the multicolor
tunability and achieving of white light emission are not reported
to the best of our knowledge. Here, in this work, we explored α-cyanostilbene
derivatives bearing triphenylamine donor and variable electron-acceptor
groups (nitro, pyridyl, and phenyl) separated by cyanovinyl π-spacer
[Scheme 1]. This design
ensures a facile but variable charge transfer between two terminals.
All the compounds exhibited solvatochromic emission with a change
in solvent polarity but emitted white light when these compounds were
mixed at specific proportions. Fine tuning the mixing ratios of these
three compounds allowed a broad emission range spanning from blue
to red regions. This strategy can pave the way for developing varieties
of organic dye admixtures to create a molecular palette for tuning
emissions and colors. The results involving the photophysical, electrochemical,
and density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT)
studies are detailed below.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the cyanostilbene derivatives
Results and Discussion
Absorption
and Emission of Cyanostilbenes
A series
of cyanostilbene derivatives were synthesized [Scheme 1] and investigated for their absorption and
emission behavior in solution. The compounds have a triphenylamine
donor linked to an aromatic ring [phenyl 1, pyridyl 2, and p-nitrophenyl 3] separated
by a π-spacer (double bond). All the compounds also have an
electron-withdrawing cyano substituent on the double bond. The absorption
and emission maxima of the compounds are given in Table 1. Compound 1 with
no electron-withdrawing group shows the absorption maxima at ∼394
nm in dioxane [Figure S1A]. Compound 2 bearing a pyridyl substituent absorbs at ∼418 nm
[Figure 1A] and compound 3 substituted with a stronger electron-withdrawing nitro group
absorbs at ∼437 nm [Figure 1B]. In effect, increasing the electron-withdrawing
strength shifts the absorption maxima to a longer wavelength in the order, 3 > 2 > 1, owing to greater
electron delocalization. A shorter wavelength band observed at 300
nm is attributed to the transitions of triphenylamine chromophore.44 The absorption at longer wavelength region is
due to the charge-transfer transition of the donor (triphenylamine)
to acceptor (cyano, pyridine, or nitro) groups. Changing the solvent
polarity does not result in any significant absorption changes, but
in water, all the compounds show broad absorption with bathochromic
shifts [Figures 1 and
S1A] attributed to the formation of aggregates.

With
increasing solvent polarity, cyanostilbene 1 shows
bathochromic emission shifts from 447 nm in nonpolar
heptane to 543 nm in polar acetonitrile with overall emission shifts
of +95 nm [Figure S1B]. Similar solvatochromic
emission shifts were noted for compound (2) [∼+123
nm shift from heptane (465 nm) to acetonitrile (588 nm)]. Compound 3 emits at 496 nm in heptane and similar to the other compounds
(1 and 2), bathochromic emission shifts
are observed with emission at 548 nm in dioxane [Figure 2B]. In polar solvents, the
emission of nitro-substituted 3 is severely quenched
because of the strong intersystem crossing and subsequent nonradiative
transitions.45 In water, interesting emission
changes are noted. Compound 1 shows emission at ∼517
nm, 2 at 561 nm, and 3, despite quenched
emission in polar solvents, emits at 626 nm. These emission maxima
are also associated with intensity enhancement [∼5 fold in 1, ∼4.3 fold in 2, and ∼56 folds
intensity enhancement in 3 in comparison with the observed
emission in acetonitrile, a polar solvent]. These emission changes
in water are attributed to aggregation-induced emission.46,47

Figure 2 Emission
spectra of (A) stilbene 2 and
(B) stilbene 3 in solvents. The excitation
wavelength is 410 nm (2) and 430 nm (3),
respectively. Concentration [10 μM].

To achieve a better insight, the emission of these compounds
was
measured in binary solvent mixtures of dioxane and water. For this,
10 μL aliquots of the stock solution of the compound in dioxane
were added to 1 mL of water to measure the emission spectrum. Stilbene 1 emits at ∼497 nm in dioxane and increase in water
fractions yields solvatochromic emission shifts with maximum emission
wavelength (545 nm) at 60% water fraction [Figure S2]. Further increase in water fraction results in
enhancement of the emission intensity (∼31 fold rise with
respect to emission intensity observed in dioxane) with a final emission
maximum at ∼517 nm. Likewise, compound 2 emits
at 517 nm in dioxane, and with increased water percent, the maximum
emission wavelength is noted at 592 nm at 60% water (∼8.8-fold
emission intensity enhancement) with the final emission maximum at
∼561 nm [Figure 3A]. Compound 3 emits at ∼550 nm in dioxane. Upon
increasing the water fraction, gradual emission shifts with quenched
emission are observed [Figure 3B] with a final emission maximum at ∼620 nm. However,
in this case, emission shifts were noted with no emission intensity
enhancement. As noted earlier [Figure 2B], the emission of compound 3 in water
is due to the formation of aggregates.47

colors seen under UV illumination (365 nm) are shown in Figure S3.

Scanning Electron Microscopy Measurements
The unique
emission noted in the aqueous media for cyanostilbenes is attributed
to the formation of aggregates. To assess the aggregate morphology,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded. The SEM images
reveal spherical aggregates with diameters of 270 nm for 1 and 365 nm for 2, and for 3, particles
of smaller diameter (123–193 nm) were observed [Figure 4]. The morphology of these
aggregates is distinct to that seen in their powdered form [Figure S4]. The dynamic light scattering (DLS)
experiments of the compounds in water and their binary mixtures show
particles in a size range of 195–550 nm [Table S1]. The size distribution obtained in DLS measurements
is slightly greater than that measured through SEM, indicating the
influence of added solvent on the size of the particles.

(10 μM) in water over a silicon wafer.

Emission Tuning: Emission of Binary Mixtures in Solution and
Solid State
Compounds 1–3 emit at different
wavelengths in water, that is, 517 nm for 1, 560 nm for 2, and 626 nm for 3. These wavelengths approximately
correspond to green, yellow, and red emission regions. Because the
designed molecules have strong structural similarity, excepting for
the end groups, we assumed that these molecules could perfectly blend
and show unique emission characteristics. For this, we performed absorption
and emission measurements in different combinations of 1 + 2, 1 + 3, 2 + 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 in equimolar concentrations (10 μM in 1 mL of water).
The absorption and emission of these blends are shown in Figure 5A. Interestingly,
the emission of all of these blends is different from what is observed
for the corresponding individual counterparts. Equimolar proportions
of 1 + 2 show unique emission at 541 nm.
Similarly, a combination of 1 and 3 or 2 and 3 yields emission at 607 and 612 nm, respectively.
The emission of 1 and 3 also shows a shoulder
band at ∼570 nm. Finally, a combination of cyanostilbenes 1 + 2 + 3 results in an emission
maxima at 588 nm (Figure 5A). Thus, by simple mixing of the structurally similar fluorophores,
tunable emission bands are observed. These blends show visually distinct
colors under UV illuminator (Figure 5B). The corresponding emission spectra obtained from the binary mixture titration
 are shown in the Supporting Information [Figure S5] and also yields visually distinct colors. SEM image
of 1 + 2 + 3 show formation
of closely associated spherical aggregates [Figure 4].

and 3 and their combinations (10 μM) in water (A)

Emission Tuning in Solid
State
To determine the solid-state
tunable emission, we measured the emission of individual fluorophores
and their combinations in the solid state [Figure 6A]. For this, 10 mg of each fluorophore was
taken, and their spectra were measured individually. Later, desired
combinations were mixed and annealed together with dioxane as the
annealing solvent. Similar to the solution state observations, distinct
emission signatures were also obtained in the solid state [Figure 6A] indicating a perfect
blend. For better visualization, we represented the emission in the
CIE color-space diagram.48 The CIE (Commission
Internationale de l’Eclairage proceedings) diagram given below
shows emissions of molecules  1, 2, and 3 in green, yellow, and reddish-yellow
regions, respectively. The combinations (2 + 3), (1 + 3), and (1 + 2) appear in orange, yellow, and yellowish green regions,
respectively. The CIE chromaticity coordinate for molecules (1–3 and mixtures) appears in the green and yellow-red
region. The CIE color coordinates (Figure 6B) obtained for the compounds are given in
the parenthesis: 1 (0.21, 0.60), 2 (0.53,
0.44); 3 (0.67, 0.23), and for the mixtures are as follows: 1 + 2 (0.41, 0.53), 1 + 3 (0.53, 0.38), 2 + 3 (0.63, 0.32), and 1 + 2 + 3 (0.43, 0.47).

the mixtures; (B) CIE plot based on the solid-state emission.

White Light Emission
To obtain white light, there is
a need for broad emission covering the visible light wavelength region.
To accomplish this, typically an additive mixture of complementary
colors (blue and green) or (red, green and blue: RGB) are needed.
The cyanostilbenes are characterized by moderate to strong solvatochromism
with a change in solvent polarity. In water, aggregation-induced emission
features are obtained, but the emission maxima of these compounds
lie outside of the RGB requirements. The binary or the ternary mixtures,
although yielded unique emission signatures and colors, failed to
yield broad emission spectra required for the white light emission.
The unique emission signatures could be a result of intermolecular
energy transfer.49−51 We examined our data closely and observed that the
emission maxima of the compounds in tetrahydrofuran (THF) closely
corresponds to the RGB region. Mixing of these compounds thus should
result in the white light emission. Accordingly, the spectra measured
yields broad emission from 380 to 700 nm for the binary mixtures of 1 and 3 [10 + 5 μM] as well as ternary
mixtures of 1, 2, and 3 (20
+ 5 + 20 μM) [Figure 7A]. The CIE coordinates [Figure 7B] observed for the binary mixture (1 + 3) and the ternary mixture combination [1 + 2 + 3] are (0.39, 0.37) and
(0.33, 0.31), respectively, that correspond to the white light emission
[inset Figure 7A].

Molecular Geometry and Transitions of the
Molecules
Density functional studies of the molecular geometries
have proven
to be an invaluable method to gain insights about the structural and
optoelectronic properties. DFT-optimized geometries of the molecules
exhibit a significant variation of torsional deviations in the gas
phase using DFT/B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The mean value
of the dihedral angle between the planes of C–N–C–C
atoms from diphenylamine unit is predicted to be ∼53°
(Figure 8). The phenyl
unit deviates from the plane with a torsional twist of ∼25°
upon its attachment to the diphenylamine part, and the vinylene unit
maintains coplanarity (2°–5°) with the acceptor units.
On the other hand, torsion of the α-cyano group is considerably
decreased with respect to increasing acceptor strength from the terminal
phenyl (29.4°) to pyridyl (22.1°) and 4-nitrophenyl units
(21.8°). The ground-state dipole moment (μg)
of the compounds 1, 2, and 3 is computed to be 6.25, 9.28, and 12.26 D, respectively. It is noted
that increasing the acceptor strength gradually augmented the ground-state
dipole moment of the molecules. The greater dipole moment (μe) obtained from transient state evidences the positive solvatochromism
of the molecules.

Electron density distribution analysis has been carried out
to
understand how the terminal acceptor units influence the charge distribution
on α-cyanostilbenes. In highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO),
the electron density is distributed over the entire molecular system
irrespective of the acceptor substitution. Nevertheless, the electron
density of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) inclined toward
the acceptor side upon photoexcitation, but it is difficult to predict
the charge distribution over the α-cyano, and the terminal acceptor
units as they seem identical (Figure 9). However, remarkable intramolecular charge
transfer (ICT) effect is found in the molecules. It is of crucial
importance to understand the role of α-cyano and terminal acceptor
units on the optoelectronic properties such as AIE, absorption, and
emission.52 Hence, to examine the exact
contribution from the individual molecular segments toward the electron
density population of the molecules in terms of their molecular orbital
density, we performed partial density of states (PDOS) calculations
by partitioning the molecular system into several segments such as
diphenylamine (D), phenylvinylene (π), α-cyano (A1), and
terminal acceptor units (A2), respectively.

Figure 9 Schematic diagram shows
the energy level comparison of the molecules
estimated from electrochemical method vs DFT predictions and the isodensity
surface plots of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs).

As displayed in Figure 10, the electron density is uniformly distributed
in HOMO that
is revealed from the molecular orbital density contribution of the
individual segments. On the other hand, in LUMO,  distinct variation
was observed with respect to terminal acceptor units. It can be explained
as follows:  Compound 1 measured in dioxane
showed the emission peak at 496 nm. At 100% water, versatile
intramolecular rotation behavior of vertically positioned α-cyano
unit to the principal axis of the molecular system is restricted upon
aggregation and yields a red-shifted emission peak.47 Explaining this from LUMO-PDOS point of view,
the contribution from the molecular orbital density of α-cyano
segment is found to be 25% for the compound 1 which is
the highest in the series. As a result, AIE of compound 1 is obtained at 517 nm with a ∼31-fold enhancement in the
emission intensity. For compound 2, AIE peak appears
at  a longer wavelength (561 nm) from its monomer peak at 517
nm in dioxane, but its emission intensity enhancement is significantly
lowered to eight-fold. The moderate electron-accepting pyridyl unit
abstracts the electron density from the α-cyano unit which decreases
the intensity of AIE peak but increases the ICT character of the system.36 In the case of compound 3, the
nitro group retains 63% of the electron density population on it by
eliminating the electron density from α-cyano group upon photoexcitation.
As a result, the ICT character of compound 3 is shifted
to longer wavelength (109 nm), but the AIEE effect is almost quenched.
To say in general words, “acceptor strength of
the peripheral units in a D−π–A system is inversely
proportional to AIE effect”;  Compound 1: dominant AIE character > compound 2: moderate
(AIE + ICT) effect > compound 3: dominant ICT character.

individual segments and its correlation with their AIE behavior of

To simulate the experimental
absorption of the molecules measured
in dimethylformamide (DMF) and to get a deeper understanding of the
excited-state transitions, TDDFT calculations were performed using
different hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and M06-2X
with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set in DMF solvent medium. B3LYP functional
reproduced an overestimated wavelength to the experimental results,
whereas CAM-B3LYP yielded an underestimation for all of the molecules.
The excitation energy predicted by M06-2X functional provides excellent
agreement with the experimental results, and the corresponding values
predicted using three functionals along with the oscillator strength
are summarized in Table 2. The maximum absorption shifts to longer wavelength upon increasing
the acceptor strength.53 We also calculated
the Mulliken population analysis for the molecules using the common
6-311G(d,p) basis set to get qualitative information on the partial
atomic charge density of the atoms. All the heteroatoms bear a negative
charge, thereby inducing a positive charge on the proximal carbon
atoms, as shown in Figure S6.

The ESP surface analysis reveals the most negative
valued potential
localization sites on the cyano and terminal electron acceptor units,
respectively, that can efficiently undergo intermolecular interactions
upon photoexcitation (Figure S7). The
geometrical coordinates of the molecules are given in Figure S8.

Electrochemical Studies
The redox activity of the complexes
was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a standard three-electrode
configuration. In DMF, the scan started from the cathodic (reduction)
direction toward the anodic side (oxidation). Irreversible oxidation
features were observed for all of the three complexes ∼0.4–0.8
V versus ferrocene. Compound 1 exhibits a small shoulder
on oxidation side around 0.45 V versus ferrocene and a subsequent
clear oxidation feature at 0.65 V versus ferrocene. Nasar and co-workers
have attributed the first peak as oxidation of triphenylamine group
for analogous compounds.54 The second feature
is possibly because of the two successive oxidations of the conjugated
double bond present in the stilbene framework, which subsequently
produces the radical cation. Compound 2 also showed
analogous anodic features; however, the position of those peaks were
altered. The triphenylamine oxidation peak shifted slightly toward
cathodic direction (negative side) at 0.43 V versus ferrocene, where
the olefin oxidation peak moved further anodic (positive direction),
and it was observed at 0.70 V versus ferrocene. Compound 3 exhibited two strong oxidation features around 0.55 and
0.70 V versus ferrocene (Figure S9). Similar
oxidation features for the molecules and the molecular mixtures were
also noted in water (30 μL of a 10 μM stock solution of
dioxane is added to 3 mL of H2O). Here, the potentials
reported are with respect to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
Compounds 1 and 2 have shown oxidation features
at 1.14 and 1.16 V versus SHE [Figure 11 and Table S2]. Interestingly, when these two compounds were mixed, an average
oxidation potential (0.15 V vs SHE) was observed for the same oxidation
process rather than retaining the original features. Analogously,
mixing compounds 2 and 3, or 1 and 3, results in similar averaging of oxidation processes
(Figure 11B). The
electrochemical data suggests that the compounds were interacting
as a mixture through π–π stacking that altered
their electronic distribution.

Figure 11 CV data of (A) compounds 1, 2, and 3 and (B) their two component
mixtures in 3% dioxane–water
solvent. The data were recorded with a glassy carbon disc electrode
at 0.1 V/s scan rate. Each scan was started from 0.4 V to a positive
direction.

Thermal Stability
For potential applications in organic
electronics, thermal stability is an important parameter. The temperature
stability of the molecules was measured using thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis. The molecular
systems bearing triphenylamine units are expected to have appreciable
thermal stability because of extensive delocalization and the strong
possibility of π–π interactions. The TGA and DSC
measurements reveal that the synthesized molecules are stable in the
range of 312–350 °C with insignificant (∼5%) weight
loss.

Thermal stability of the molecules gradually increased
in the following order: 1 < 2 < 3 (Figure S10). The high thermal
stability of triphenylamine derivatives is attributed to the presence
of a greater number of phenyl units. The melting point of molecules obtained
from DSC was different from TGA because of tight molecular packing,
and the values are found in the range of 146–194 °C. The
excellent thermal stability of the compounds reveals their utilization
in optoelectronic device applications.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we successfully obtained white light emission
by using different CIE color coordinates (0.39, 0.37) and (0.33, 0.31)
for binary and ternary combinations, respectively, of structurally
similar D−π–A based on α-cyanostilbene constructs
with varying electron-withdrawing groups. The synthesized molecules
show excellent solvatochromic emission because of ICT as well as strong
emission in the solid state. Varying proportions of the compounds
yield tunable emission signatures and distinct colors. DFT studies
illustrated a fine-tuning of AIE and ICT effects with respect to the
terminal acceptor units present in the compounds. The electrochemical
results also suggested intermolecular interactions in mixture conditions.
Thus, these results have highlighted the potential of using tunable
photoactive organic compounds for the fabrication of tunable optical
materials through simple structural changes.

Experimental Section
Reagents required for the synthesis of the phenylacrylonitrile
derivatives were obtained from Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, Sigma-Aldrich,
and S. D. FineChem. The absorption spectral data were recorded using
Analytic Jena, Specord 210 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission
spectra were obtained using Horiba Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker
Avance 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. The accurate mass analysis was
performed using a Waters-Synapt G2S (ESI-QToF) mass spectrometer.
For the absorption or fluorescence studies, 10 μL of the desired
fluorophore stock solution in dioxane (∼10–3 M) was added to 1 mL (effective concentration ≈ 10 μM)
of the desired solvent media. Typically, the excitation wavelengths
were set at the absorption maxima (λabs) of the compounds
under investigation, and the emission (λem) reported
is uncorrected. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
SEM analysis was carried out using a field-emission SEM (JSM 7600F
JEOL). For this purpose, one drop of the sample [∼10 μM
solutions] was deposited on a Si wafer mounted on an aluminum stub
with the help of a double-sided adhesive carbon tape. The samples
were heat-dried at 35 °C for 12 h and vacuum dried for 30 min
to ensure complete removal of any residual water and coated with platinum
before being analyzed. TGA was performed with a TGA/SDTA 851e (Mettler
Toledo) thermal analyzer using a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range
of 33–550 °C. CV measurements were performed on Metrohm
Autolab Potentiostat (PGSTAT101) with the dyes at variable scan rates
in an organic solvent (DMF) or organic solvent–water mixture.
A 1 mm diameter glassy carbon disc electrode was used as a working
electrode, whereas a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl solution
were used as a counter and a reference electrode, respectively. Ferrocene
and K4Fe(CN)6 were used as internal standards
for organic (0 V vs ferrocene couple) and aqueous solutions (or +0.36
V vs SHE), respectively.

Synthetic Methods
The synthetic
strategy for the synthesis
of desired derivatives is given in Scheme 1.

Synthesis of Triphenylamine-1-yl Acetonitrile
Derivatives (1–3)
Substituted phenylacetonitrile
derivatives
(3.6 mmol) and formyl triphenylamine (3.6 mmol) was taken in a round-bottomed
flask. To this, 120 μL of piperidine in 10 mL of ethanol was
added, and the contents of the flask were heated for 24 h at 80 °C.
The reaction was cooled to room temperature and washed with ethanol.
Light yellow 1, dark yellow 2, and red 3 colored products obtained were purified using column chromatography.
The characterization data is given in the Supporting Information Figures S11–S18.

Computational Details
All the theoretical
calculations
have been performed within the framework of DFT using Gaussian 09
quantum ab initio software package. Geometry optimization of the molecules was
carried out using DFT/B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The optimized
geometries are subjected to vibrational frequency analysis to ensure
the real minima on the potential energy surface. All the simulations
were carried out in the gas phase, and no symmetry constraints were
imposed during the optimization. These molecular structural coordinates
were used as input for further single-point calculations including
electron density distribution analysis of FMOs, TDDFT simulations,
and PDOS analysis. TDDFT calculations (first 15 vertical singlet–singlet
transitions) have been employed using various hybrid functionals such
as B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and M06-2X with a standard 6-311G(d,p) basis
set.55 The integral equation formalism
conductor-like the polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) within the
self-consistent reaction field theory was used to describe the solvation
of the molecules.56 To interpret the major
portion of the absorption spectrum and to analyze the nature of transitions,
GaussSum 2.2.5 software has been utilized.57 Mulliken population analysis and electrostatic potential surface
(ESP) studies have been employed to examine the partial atomic charge
and charge population of the molecules, respectively.
