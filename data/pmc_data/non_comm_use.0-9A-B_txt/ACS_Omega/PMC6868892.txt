The mechanism of the reaction of lithium and magnesium carbenoids with ethylene to
give cyclopropane has been explained in detail in all the steps at
the G4 level of theory. We explored the lithium and magnesium interaction
toward πC=C and σC–C bonds in the reactants and the products. We have also investigated
the reaction path by means of the force profile formalism in order
to highlight the electronic and the structural rearrangements along
the potential energy surface of the cyclopropanation. The results
indicate that all of the reactions are stepwise, exoenergetic, with
low barriers. All our findings were confirmed by dynamic simulations
for chlorometal carbenoids. Furthermore, from the intrinsic reaction
coordinate procedure, we were able to find out the intermediates that
can take place when the reaction is descending from the transition
state to the products or reactants. The reaction force analysis at
B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) indicates that the energy barriers are mostly due
to structural rearrangements which are produced by the approach of
the carbenoid to ethylene. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules and
electron localization function analyses indicate that products, reactants,
and intermediates form complexes stabilized by attractive forces between
Li/Mg and single/double bonds.

Introduction
In molecular synthesis,
there are many possible pathways that can
connect the reactants and products. Hence, the proposed mechanisms
usually involve different types of intermediates. Rather often, a
wise combination of imagination and experimental pieces of evidence
may suggest molecular structures that are rather far from chemical
intuition. In chemical textbooks, the possible intermediates in a
chemical reaction are classified into four groups: cations, anions,
radicals, and carbenes. In particular, carbenes have been proved to
be systems with unique reactivities,1−6 although normally under extreme conditions due to their high reactivity.
Closely related to carbenes are the so-called carbenoids, a term used
for the first time by Closs and Moss in the early sixties7,8 to designate any system having the characteristics of a carbene
or able to produce carbenes, in other words, systems that may react
as carbenes even though they are not free divalent carbon species.9 Carbenoids have been shown to be particularly
useful in cyclopropanation reactions,10−12 in organic synthesis,
and as catalysis intermediates.13−17

Recovering the way to gain cyclopropane derivatives may be
considered
as a springboard to attain many valuable compounds, including natural
products and biologically active species.18−21 Understanding their chemistry
becomes mandatory before exploring the paths to reach them. In gas
phase and precisely by computational methods, the study of reactivity
in chemistry has largely showed its validity to understand complex
systems.

The main aim of the present paper is to explore the
simplest way
to reach cyclopropane within reactants as lithium and magnesium carbenoids.
Why do we choose these reactants? The main reason for this choice,
besides the ones cited above, is to be able to apply the highest level
of theory such as the G4 theory and describe adequately the stationary
points. The second reason is to try to offer a novel point of view
on the interaction of lithium and magnesium with double and single
covalent bonds. Hence our survey on cyclopropanation reactions, involving
carbenoids with a metalated carbon atom, such as an alkyl lithium
or alkyl magnesium R2C(X)M (M = Li, Mg; X = F, Cl, Br),
is to get a new picture of the insertion of CH2 to ethylene.

The second goal of our work is to explore the reactivity toward
ethene as a simple model for more complex systems.22−25 The reaction mechanism of cyclopropanation
reactions involving carbenoid systems vary depending on the carbon
bonded to the metal and the metal itself. It can be either a single-step
reaction, concerted, or a stepwise mechanism. Actually, cyclopropanation
reactions involving iodomethyl zinc iodide carbenoids seems to proceed
by a concerted mechanism.13,26 Other studies reported
on lithium carbenoids have shown that the concerted pathway was always
favored over a stepwise or carbometallation mechanism that exclusively
occurs with lithium aggregates.27−29 All these analyses were based
on the use of low-level theoretical methods, and no detailed exploration
of the reaction mechanism was done. On this sense, our main aim in
this study is to use specific mechanism analysis formalisms, such
as the reaction force and the reaction electronic flux,30,31 to unambiguously recover the nature of the mechanism involved. This
analysis will be combined with other reactivity descriptors to gain
further insights on the intrinsic changes that occur when ethene is
transformed to cyclopropane by the action of lithium and magnesium
carbenoids, including halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) as leaving groups.

Theoretical
Framework
The theoretical descriptors are used for the analysis
of the reaction
mechanisms; energetic and electronic properties of carbenoid cyclopropanation
reaction are defined in the following paragraphs:

Reaction Force
To characterize reaction mechanisms,
the evaluation of energy is the most important task that gives information
about the reaction energy (ΔE°) and the
height of the reaction barrier (ΔE⧧).

The reaction force is the first derivative of the reaction
energy over the reaction coordinate and is defined as30−35 1  

In a single step potential, this function presents two critical
points, a minimum ξ1 and a maximum ξ2. These points delimit three zones: the reactant zone (from ξR to ξ1) where the structural rearrangements
occur, the transition-state zone (from ξ1 to ξ2) where all of the electronic rearrangements take place and
the product zone defined from ξ2 to ξP where structural relaxation of the system occurs to lead to products.
From these partitions, it is possible to get the works associated
with structural and electronic phenomena.36

Electronic Chemical Potential
From conceptual density
functional theory, various response functions or local and global
reactivity descriptors can be defined.37,38 One of the
most important properties is the electronic chemical potential or
the escaping tendency of electrons from an equilibrium state. It has
been associated with the negative of electronegativity defined by
Mulliken. For an N electron system, chemical potential
is defined as37,38 2  

Owing to the discontinuity of the energy
along the number of particles, the finite difference approximation
can be used to get an analytic expression of μ in terms of the
ionization energy I and the electron affinity A. Also within Koopman’s theorem, this index can
be expressed in term of the frontier orbital of highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), εHOMO and εLUMO.38 3  

Reaction Electronic Flux
The relation between electron
flux and the gradient of the chemical potential is used to define
the reaction electronic flux.32,35,39,40 This index measures the electronic
reorganization in a chemical reaction and is defined as 4  

In analogy with thermodynamics, this
property can be associated with the spontaneity of the electronic
processes. When J(ξ) is positive, it may point
out to a spontaneous reorganization of the electron cloud, indicating
bond forming or strengthening, and when it is negative, the electronic
changes are then nonspontaneous meaning bond breaking or weakening.31,41

Results and Discussion
Lithium and magnesium are known
by their ability to donate their
valence electrons when interacting with new species. Its electronic
charge in a molecule where they are inserted usually approaches unity
for lithium and two for magnesium. This makes the adjacent atoms chemically
more reactive. The lithium carbenoid inserts easily CH2 into a double bond in ethene or ethylene, leading a rupture of π
bond substituted by two new σ bonds.

In order to analyze
in detail the mechanism of the cyclopropane
formation, that is, the energetic, structural, and electronic profiles
of this transformation, a series of G4 calculations of the reactants,
products, and transition states connecting them have been carried
out. The calculations have been achieved considering different halogen
atoms as substituents in order to counteract the electropositive effect
of the alkaline metal and consequently explore their effect on electronic
distribution in this reaction. Our research was additionally extended
to consider the magnesium-containing carbenoids in order to explore
the differences that could exist between alkaline and alkaline-earth
metals.

The first step to have a complete picture of the reaction
mechanism
is to explore the nature and strength of the interactions between
the reactants. The optimized structures show that the most stable
configuration corresponds to the metal interacting with the double
bond of ethylene with interatomic distances between the metal and
the double bond of about 2.3 and 2.5 Å for lithium and magnesium,
respectively (see Figure S1). As far as
the nature of the interaction is concerned, the electron localization
function (ELF) shows the existence of a trisynaptic basin (M, C, C)
(M = Li, Mg) associated with the polarization of the C=C double
bond toward the metal center (see Figure 1). This is consistent with the presence of
a bond critical point(BCP) between the metal and the π cloud
of the C=C bond, with an electronic density about 0.016 a.u.

most important points. The electronic density in the BCP is in a.u.
while the electronic charge in the mentioned basin is in e. (Li: purple,
Mg: yellow, Cl: green, C: gray, Br: red, F: light green, H: white).

The dissociation energy, De, of an
AB system is defined as the difference between the energy global system,
AB, and the sum of the energies of the two fragments, A and B, when
all of them are in their equilibrium conformation. However, additional
information on the nature and strength of the interaction can be achieved
by evaluating the interaction energy (Eint), defined as the difference between the energy of the global system
AB and the sum of the energies of the two fragments, A and B, when
they retain the structure they had in the global system. It is obvious,
as illustrated in Scheme 1, that De can be decomposed in
two terms: the interaction energy, Eint, and the deformation energy (Edef),
defined as the energy necessary to distort the structure of the subunits
A and B from their equilibrium geometry to their forms in the complex.
The results for both sets of compounds are reported in Table 1.

The dissociation energies indicate a typical lithium and magnesium
bonds toward a π-system which was already highlighted by Ammal
et al. for C2H4–LiX (X = H, F)42 complexes and by Li et al. for C2H4–MgX2 (X = H, F) ones.43 The dissociation energies found for the halocarbon
are found to be slightly smaller to the ones reported previously by
Ammal et al.42 and Li et al.,43 respectively. In the case of Mg, the difference
is larger, being the G4 estimates systematically smaller.

We
have found that for these systems the deformation energy is
negligibly small for Li-containing carbenoids, independent of the
nature of the leaving group (F, Cl, Br). Conversely, the same deformation
energies are not negligible for the Mg-containing analogues, being
up to 21% of the total interaction energy.

The second-order
natural bond orbital (NBO) perturbation analysis
shows that the interaction between the carbenoid and ethylene involves
the bonding πC–C orbital of the former and
the σC–M* (M = Li, Mg) antibonding orbital of the carbenoid, with a
perturbation energy being of the order of 8.0 kcal/mol (see Figure 2). The partial population
of this antibonding orbital predicted by the NBO method is consistent
with the lengthening observed for the C–M (M = Li, Mg) bonds
on going from the isolated carbenoid to the complex between the carbenoid
and ethylene (Figure S1). It should be
mentioned that although this effect is weaker for Li- than for Mg-containing
systems, it raises the question of why the deformation energy is negligibly
small for Li systems, whereas for Mg ones it is not.

between πC=C of ethylene and the
anti-bonding σ* of magnesium chloromethane Mg–C bond.

A more detailed exploration of the ethylene-M-carbenoid
adducts
(M = Li, Mg) clearly shows that as mentioned above, the M–CH2 and the M–X (X = F, Cl, Br) of the carbenoid become
longer with respect to the separated systems, whereas the X–CH2 distance becomes shorter for the Li-containing systems; this
effect is almost inexistent for Mg-containing ones (see Figure S1). This means that for Li the formation
of the complex with ethylene implies X–CH2 bond
shortening that counterbalance the effect of the Li–CH2 and the Li–X bond lengthening, whereas this effect
is practically inexistent for Mg. By contrast, in the later the perturbation
induced by the interaction is translated into a deformation of the
carbenoid structure. The angle XMgCH2 is reduced from 169°
in the isolated reactant to 136° in the chlorine complex. Therefore,
the complexation affects the bonds of lithium complexes while in the
magnesium systems changes the angle between atoms.

To get in
the mechanism of the formation of cyclopropane it is
reliable to present the reactants as the interaction between the metal
and the double bond of ethylene as reported above. However, from this
interaction a first accommodation of the fragments where methylene
group needs to get closer to π bond is mandatory. This raises
a fundamental question: how do the isolate reactants (Li/Mg halo-carbenoids
and ethylene) evolve to products? To answer this question the first
step is to find out the transition states that connect reactants and
products followed by a detailed description of the different stationary
points of potential energy surface of the reaction. Our calculation
at the G4 level of theory suggests a transition-state structure where
methylene is nearby the π bond of ethene. Its activation energy
is about 8.0 and 5.8 kcal/mol above the entrance channel if we take,
as example, chlorine derivative in lithium and magnesium reactions,
respectively.

To get a detailed picture of the process, an intrinsic
reaction
coordinate (IRC) calculation was carried out in order to find out
the minima in both directions following the reaction coordinate. The
results are reported in Figure 3. The most important finding was that in the reaction pathways
an intermediate [I(Li)/I1(Mg)] takes place in the reverse
direction. This means that the interaction between reactants can go
through the minimum previously proposed in the literature42,43 [R(Li)/R(Mg)] then, by a structural reorganization attains the intermediate
I(Li)/I1(Mg) to reach the transition state. In the forward
direction, the lithium mechanism progresses directly to product while
the magnesium reaction goes through an intermediate, namely, [I2(Mg)], before reaching the product (see Figure 3b). It is worth noting that all our tries
to find transition states between the intermediates and the reactants
or products were unsuccessful. It is quite intuitive because the subtle
structural differences between these species suggest the rearrangement
between them to be barrierless.

relative energies obtained at the G4 level of theory are in kcal/mol.
Color codes are as follows: blue: fluorine, red: chlorine, and green:
bromine. Relative energies obtained at the G4 level of theory are
in kcal/mol (Li: purple, Mg: yellow, Cl: green, C: gray, H: white).

At this stage, based on the IRC calculation we
can conclude that
the mechanism of the cyclopropane formation is not concerted, but
it is a two-step process. The formation of the two new C–C
bonds initially corresponds to the formation of an intermediate I(Li)/I1(Mg), where the first C–C bond begins its assembly
to reach the TS(Li)/TS(Mg), which in turn is followed by a formation
of second C–C bond leading to the final product P(Li). In the
case of magnesium, the second step goes through an intermediary I2(Mg), which collapses directly to the product by a simple
accommodation of MgX2 on the cyclopropane ring (see Figure 3).

This description
is totally coherent with the results of the noncovalent
interaction (NCI) plots and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules
(QTAIM) analysis. If we focus on the lithium mechanism (see Figure 4), the NCI analysis
of the intermediate shows an attractive region (Figure 4a) between the carbon of the LiClCH2 system and one of the carbon atoms of the ethylene molecule. Consistently,
the QTAIM presents a BCP between both carbon atoms (Figure 4b), whereas the energy density
in the region (Figure 4c) also indicates a bonding interaction.

To validate our assumption, a molecular dynamics
propagation of
the nuclei from the transition state was done by means of the atom-centered
density matrix propagation (ADMP).44−46 The main objective is
to localize the points that the interaction of halocarbenoid with
ethene overpasses in its travel from the reactants to products.

Over the 20 explored trajectories in each case we selected the
ones which can describe roughly the mechanism in both reactions. In Figure 5 represents the evolution
in both directions [reverse (a) and forward (b)] of the chlorocarbenoid
Mg mechanism from the transition state to reactants and products,
respectively. The chloro-lithium mechanism is reported in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). The first
conspicuous result from dynamics is the existence of the intermediate
I1(Mg)/I(Li) as one of minima of the mechanism pathway.
It appears in the range between 50 and 100 fs with a HOMO orbital
involving the lone pair of carbon and the π orbital of the ethene
double bond (see Figure 5a). The mechanism elapses then through this, confirming the IRC calculations.
In the forward direction, we can deduce that the cyclopropane begins
its formation at approximately 50 fs. The intermediate I2(Mg) appears at about 100 fs to get transformed to P(Mg) at about
150 fs. The energy of the mechanism expressed by the dynamics potential
energy follows the same trends as in the static calculation. Both
potential energy surfaces (Figures 3 and 5), indicate that although
the carbenoid reactions follow a stepwise energy, they are extremely
favorable, thus with an endoenergetic reaction and low barriers leading
to products. These results confirm that the reactions need a small
activation, and might be the reason why carbenoid reactions are performed
at low temperatures.27

(in kcal/mol) of the Mg-halocarbenoid
mechanism to reactants (a) and to product (b) during ADMP simulation
of 400 fs. The structure of some selected points is reported by their
HOMO and LUMO orbitals.

To understand the structural
and electronic contributions to the
reaction energy profile, we have determined the reaction force and
their associated works that are shown in Table 2 and Figure 6. Because the progress of the reaction profile could
not overpass the intermediates in both reactions (Li and Mg), the
following analysis will be exclusively focused on the region achieved
by the IRC calculation. Therefore, the relative energies and barriers
are calculated from now on at this level of theory, taking as reference
the intermediates I(Li)/I(Mg). It is to note that the trends with
the calculation at the G4-level of theory reported in Figure 3 are conserved.

The first conspicuous conclusion
from the energy profile is that
the primary structural reorganization at the transition state oscillates
in the range 4.3–8.0 kcal/mol. In fact, focusing on this step
and going deeper on the force profile analysis, we can shed some light
on more aspects. Hence, by evaluating the energy and the force profile,
the structural reorganization with respect to the electronic reorganization
presents about 70% of the activation energy in lithium carbenoids
at the determinant step of the reaction. This analysis is reinforced
when the works corresponding to each zone of the reaction profile
are evaluated. As it can be appreciated in the Table 2 which can be confirmed by the values reported
in Figure 3, the reaction
is highly exothermic. The halogen electronegativity affects slightly
the global activation barriers if the reactant [R(Li)] is taken as
reference see Figure 3. However, if we analyze the profile from I(Li) to the products,
we can notice that fluorine derivative is the less reactive species
in the lithium carbenoid reaction, whereas in the Mg counterparts
it appears the most reactive. In the former the energy barrier accounts
for the highest activation energy in the lithium set (about 6.2 kcal/mol)
while in the latter it accounts for the smallest barrier in the Mg
set (about 4.2 kcal/mol). Chlorine and bromine derivatives in the
lithium reaction present similar reactivity whereas in the Mg homologues
chlorine is slightly more reactive than the bromine derivative. The
electronic rearrangement in global trending is similar in all of the
reactions considered. The work W2 which
reflects these changes oscillates around 2 kcal/mol. However, if we
compare its participation in the activation energy, we found that
the electronic rearrangement is about 30% in all of the cases with
exception of Mg–Cl and Mg–Br that present values of
17 and 13%. This result can be understood by the electronegative capability
of the atoms under scrutiny.

With respect to the third and fourth
step of the mechanism, W3 and W4 indicate that
the electronic rearrangement
is slightly higher than the structural relaxation in the formation
of the product. These last works might be associated with the bond
breaking and the formation of the cyclopropane, and the following
formation of the complex between the halide salt and the cyclopropane.

We have so far obtained the energies and the contributions to the
main step of the cyclopropanation reactions. However, it is necessary
to understand the electronic rearrangements during both reactions
and the nature of the reactive intermediaries.

For the electronic
analysis, we have used the REF formalism over
the IRCs calculations from I(Li) to P(Li) on lithium and from I1(Mg) to I2(Mg) on magnesium carbenoids. The plots
of the reaction electronic flux are shown in Figure 6, using the geometries given by the IRC calculations.
For all of the systems, this index starts at the reactant zone, indicating
that the electronic phenomena are coupled to the structural rearrangements.
Most of the changes are concentrated at the transition state. For
both Li–X and Mg–X profiles, some electronic activity
at the product zone was observed which might be associated with the
rotation of the cyclopropane to attain the product. The sign of the
flux in this region indicates a spontaneous reaction step, which might
be representing bond strengthening/formation. In other words, it could
denote the interactions that appears between the metal (Li, Mg) and
cyclopropane at the product or intermediary I2(Mg) in the
case of magnesium.

With alkyl magnesium carbenoids, all of the
systems present changes
condensed at the same points of the IRC, indicating a spontaneous
rearrangement, followed by a nonspontaneous change that might be associated
with the detachment of the CH2 group in order to form the
cyclopropane. With lithium, we found mild changes that follow the
same trend; this might be attributed to the electronic nature of the
alkyl lithium carbenoid, and analyzing the charges of the systems,
the CH2 radical has less electronic charge (∼0.8|e|) in contrast to their magnesium counterparts (∼1.0|e|).

Having explored all of the stationary structures
of the potential
energy surface of the lithium and magnesium carbenoids, it appears
necessary to close our study by a discussion of the complexation in
products. In other words, lithium and magnesium bonds with cyclopropane
are of a great relevance to be analyzed. In fact, in the cyclopropane
the interaction is provided by σC–C to the
metal which is underlined by a great electronic donation from the
σC–C orbital to the empty antibonding orbital
σM–X* (see Figure 7). The
second-order perturbation analysis in the NBO population quantifies
this donation by approximately 2.3 kcal/mol for lithium, whereas for
magnesium it is about 1.6 kcal/mol for each Mg–X bond in the
case of chlorine derivatives.

Figure 7 Reaction electronic flux in lithium and magnesium
carbenoids X
= F (black), Cl (blue), Br (red).

It is worth to mention that the interaction between the metal and
cyclopropane has been also explored by QTAIM and ELF techniques. The
presence of a BCP and trisynaptic basin in the interaction region
is a great proof of that (see Figure 8). The effect of halogen substitution is noticeable
in the lithium bonding because the electronic density in the BCP between
the metal and cyclopropane increases when moving from the most electronegative
halogen (F) to the least electronegative one (Br). It is clear that
the nature of halogen plays an important role in the interaction.
In fact, the high electronegativity of the halogen apparently disfavors
the complexation of lithium to the cyclopropane. These results can
be ratified if the binding energies involved are analyzed in each
case. In fact, the binding energies of LiX and cyclopropane are about
8.8, 10.9, and 11.6 kcal/mol for F, Cl, and Br, respectively. In the
case of magnesium complexation even with two halogen atoms attached
to the metal, the perturbation to get a complex appears minimal. The
electronic densities of
the bond critical points and the binding energies of each association
can demonstrate it (Figure 9).

analysis in the orbital interactions between cyclopropane and LiCl

Conclusions
In this study, we have
presented the cyclopropanation reactions
on magnesium and lithium carbenoids substituted with halogens (F,
Cl, Br) with ethylene at the G4 theory level. We found that all of
the Li and Mg reactions are stepwise with intermediaries that are
basically in between the transition states and do not differ in more
than 4 kcal/mol from the reactants and products. Our findings suggest
a new mechanism of the cyclopropanations by Li and Mg carbenoid.

The Li and Mg reactants are formed by an electrostatic interaction
of the π bond with the electron-deficient metal coming from
the carbenoid. These results were confirmed by QTAIM, ELF, and NBO
analysis.

The inspection of the works given by the reaction
force at the
determinant step indicated that the structural work defines the barrier
height, being the highest at Mg carbenoids and associated with the
transposition of the methyl group and rearrangement of the carbenoid
in order to get the transition state.

The REF analysis pointed
out that the electronic rearrangements
occur mostly at the TS zone where all of the bond forming and breaking
take place and are characterized by a spontaneous flux at the beginning
of the TS zone and a nonspontaneous by the end of the same zone. At
the products zone, there is some electronic activity related to the
rearrangement of the cyclopropane in order to give a complex with
the halide salt I(Li) and I2(Mg). The QTAIM, ELF, and NBO
analysis indicated that an electrostatic interaction between the cyclopropane
and the halide lithium and halide magnesium salt is formed.

was established by applying the IRC procedure at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)48,49 level of theory, taking into account more than 180 points far from
the transition state in each direction. In order to test our assumptions,
dynamic simulation was done for some selected systems. ADMP molecular
dynamics44−46 was chosen with simulation time of 400 femtosecond
and an initial kinetic energy about 6.3 kcal/mol. The selection of
the velocities and momentums along the transition-state coordinate
is done randomly.

All of the calculations have been carried
out by means of Gaussian
09 series of programs.50 The electronic
population analysis was done by the QTAIM,51,52 by using the AIMall program,53 NBO,54−56 and the ELF57−59 using TopMOD suite of programs.60 To highlight the weak interaction, we used the NCI method
proposed by Contreras-García et al.61
