This study reports the potential
of a unique functional composite
for anti-icing applications. To date, various ionic salt formulations
have been applied to prevent ice accumulation on surfaces. However,
salt can be removed by external factors and large amounts must be
used to attain anti-icing properties. Incorporating hydrophilic salts
into hydrophobic mediums and controlled release of specific agents
can provide effective solution to reduce ice accumulation on surfaces.
Here, we developed functional polymer composites with salt pockets
of altered ionic salts consisting of potassium formate (KCOOH), sodium
chloride (NaCl), or magnesium chloride (MgCl2). We dissolved
ionic salts in hydrophilic gel domains and dispersed in a hydrophobic
styrene–butadiene–styrene polymer matrix. Na+ and Cl– ions delayed ice formation by 42.6 min
at −2 °C compared to that for unmodified surfaces. Functional
composites prepared with the NaCl ionic salt exhibited better anti-icing
behavior at −2 °C because of their high concentration
compared to that of the composites prepared with KCOOH and MgCl2 ionic salts. We also characterized the release of ionic salts
from composite-modified hydrophobic medium separately up to 118 days.
Furthermore, we monitored freezing of water on composite-incorporated
or composite-coated hydrophobic surfaces in a camera-integrated cold
chamber with a uniform temperature (−2 °C). The results
demonstrated significant increases in the delay of freezing on composite-incorporated
or composite-coated surfaces compared to that on controls. We observed
altered effects of each ionic salt on the mechanical, morphological,
and functional properties of the composite-incorporated or composite-coated
hydrophobic surfaces. Our results suggested that the efficiency of
a polymer composite to promote anti-icing behavior on a surface is
directly related to the type and concentration of the particular ionic
salt incorporation into the composite. This approach is promising
and demonstrates significant potential of the ionic salt embedded
within polymer composite-modified hydrophobic surfaces to attain delayed
icing function.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Anti-icing
strategies are based on disrupting ice crystallization
before it builds up on a surface. Ionic salts can depress the freezing
point of water and therefore they have been commonly used to eliminate
accumulation of ice on surfaces. Yet, salt can easily be removed by
external factors and requires frequent application. Besides their
economical consideration, using large amounts of anti-icing agents
weakens mechanical properties of surfaces and has negative impacts
on living organisms and the environment.1−3

Sodium chloride
(NaCl), calcium chloride (CaCl2), potassium
formate (KCOOH), and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) have been
frequently used for this purpose.1 However,
bulk application of salts on surfaces has negative impact on the mechanical
strength of the underlying surface and damages vehicles, plants, and
many living organisms. To address this limitation, several other approaches
were used to eliminate ice upon its formation on a surface. Electrical
systems have been considered through the use of wiring underneath
surfaces and activation of heating when needed to reduce ice deposition.
However, this application has high energy requirements and demands
high costs and hence considered as not feasible. Because of these
limitations associated with deicing, many studies focused on the development
of an anti-icing approach through delaying of ice formation on surfaces.2−4

Altering the topology is a major strategy to achieve an ice-repellent
surface. Self-assembled monolayers, bulk coatings, micro- and nanostructures,
and infused polymers can be employed on surfaces for the development
of anti-icing property, and a common method to reduce ice adhesion
and deposition involves super-hydrophobic surfaces.2,4−18 This approach has shown several promising results and is based on
the rough surface structure to inhibit nucleation of ice on a variety
of surfaces. However, the super-hydrophobic surface approach is not
always applicable for all surfaces as those surfaces promote slip
with exposure to water.10,19 These surfaces also
result in a high ice adhesion strength on rough surfaces because of
the large contact area between the solid and the ice under high humidity
and water condensation conditions.20 In
addition, repeated icing/deicing cycles on super-hydrophobic surfaces
damage the micro/nanostructure, which further increases ice adhesion
strength with time.21

Other approaches
to promote anti-icing on surfaces included graphite
and carbon fiber-reinforced conductive structure5 and rubber nanoparticles.6 Geothermal
energy was also used to delay icing on tunnels and bridges.7,22 Feasibility of super-hydrophilic polymer brush coatings,9 super-hydrophobic coatings on composite silicone
rubber,8 nanoparticle–polymer composites,23 and anti-icing fillers were investigated as
alternative methods for anti-icing applications.3,24,25 In another study, researchers tested the
potential of fillers such as NaCl, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) into complex hydrophobic
fluids to gain anti-icing property. Delays in frost formation and
decreases in adhesion between the ice and surfaces were reported.
However, these fillers included high concentrations of salt (70–75%
(w/w)), which had negative impacts on the mechanical and morphological
properties of the underlying surface.

To date, hydrophilic ionic
salts could not be effectively incorporated
into hydrophobic surfaces and controlled release of these molecules
from surfaces to obtain anti-icing property has not been achieved.
To address these challenges, we modified a hydrophobic medium with
a polymer composite, which was prepared using the nanoparticle-stabilized
Pickering emulsion approach. The polymer composite has a hybrid nature
and contains anti-icing agents within the hydrophilic domains that
are embedded in a continuous hydrophobic styrene–butadiene–styrene
(SBS) polymer. We investigated the mechanical, morphological, and
functional properties of modified hydrophobic platforms in our previous
studies where we used potassium formate ionic salt as an anti-icing
agent.26,27 Potassium formate has many advantages compared
with other salts such as its high solubility and environmentally friendly
properties. However, it is costly compared with the other commonly
used NaCl, MgCl2, or CaCl2.

In our current
study, to further explore the influence of different
hydrophilic ionic salts on the mechanical, morphological, and functional
properties, we prepared hydrophobic surfaces that were either modified
or coated with our composites. We investigated the potential of NaCl,
MgCl2, and KCOOH in our functional polymer composite, where
we monitored freezing of water in realistic conditions. The results
suggested that freezing delays could be tuned with the type and amount
of hydrophilic ionic salt incorporation into the composite as well
as through the surface coating strategy. According to our knowledge,
it is the first time that such well-defined surface characterizations
have been systematically investigated through functional hybrid composites
to promote the anti-icing property. This approach is promising for
the development of complex hydrophobic fluids and hence surfaces are
prepared with these fluids, with the anti-icing function and for industrially
relevant applications.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Styrene–butadiene–styrene
(SBS, S/B weight fraction: 70:30) block copolymer (Kraton D1101),
potassium formate (KCOOH) (99%), magnesium chloride (MgCl2) (99%) and NaCl (99%) (Sigma-Aldrich), silica nanoparticles (AEROSIL
R 816), agar powder (Sigma-Aldrich), and cyclohexanone (99.9%) (Merck)
were used for the synthesis of particle-stabilized emulsions. The
hydrophobic fluid (50/70 penetration grade bitumen) was kindly provided
by TÜPRAŞ. Deionized water was used in all experiments
(PURELAB Option, ELGA).

2.2 Preparation of Composite-Modified
Hydrophobic
Surfaces
2.2.1 Preparation of Pickering Emulsions
Emulsions were prepared as described in our previous study.26 Briefly, emulsions with 0.25 (v/v) internal
volume fraction (Φ = 0.25) and 1.5% (w/v) nanoparticle concentration
in the internal phase were prepared. The concentration of salt used
in emulsions was determined on the basis of the solubility of NaCl
in water because NaCl has the lowest solubility in water among the
salts used in this work. Thus, 0.5 mL of ionic salt (0.3 g/mL) salt
solution-dissolved agar was added to 0.5 mL of 1.0% (w/v) nanoparticle–cyclohexanone
stock solution under mixing by vortex for 10–15 s. After the
formation of Pickering emulsion, 1 mL of the SBS polymer in cyclohexanone
(110 mg/mL) was added drop-wise to 1 mL of the ionic salt, agar, and
nanoparticle mixture by mixing gently.

2.2.2 Preparation
of Functional Composites and
Incorporation into the Hydrophobic Fluid
Prepared emulsions
were cast in Petri dishes to obtain functional composite membranes.
Then, dry membranes were incorporated into the hydrophobic fluid (5%
(w/v)), as described in our previous study.26,27 After processing, the samples were kept at room temperature. These
samples are referred to as composite-incorporated surfaces throughout
the text.

2.2.3 Preparation of Composite-Coated
Hydrophobic
Surfaces
Emulsions were coated on hydrophobic surfaces via
spin-coating (Figure 1). Five hundred microliter of the emulsion was dropped on 4 cm2 of the hydrophobic fluid-covered surface and coated with
a spin-coater (SCS—Special Spin-Coating Systems) at 1000 rpm
for 60 s. Next, emulsion-coated slides were dried overnight to obtain
composite coatings on hydrophobic surfaces. These samples are referred
to as composite-coated surfaces throughout the text.

of (a) composite-incorporating and
(b) composite-coated samples.

2.3 Surface Characterization of Composite-Modified
Surfaces
2.3.1 Fluorescence Microscopy
Fluorescence
microscopy was used to infer SBS distribution in polymer-modified
hydrophobic surfaces. The morphologies of composite-incorporated hydrophobic
fluids were analyzed under fluorescence microscopy with an emission
wavelength of 520 nm and excitation wavelength of 450–490 nm.

2.3.2 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) experiments were conducted in a Bruker Dimension
ICON AFM with MPP21100-10 REFSP tips. 20 × 20 μm2 of sample surfaces were scanned. Imaging was performed in soft tapping
mode at room temperature to acquire phase difference microscopy images.

2.4 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
The rheology
experiments were performed using a Discovery Hybrid Series-2 Rheometer
(TA). Dynamic mechanical analysis was conducted using oscillation
tests between parallel plates within the region of the linear viscoelastic
response. Viscoelastic parameters were measured at 0.02 Hz constant
frequency and temperature sweeps between 20 and 120 °C. The tests
were undertaken with 20 mm diameter parallel plate geometry with a
1 mm gap.26

2.5 Characterization
of Functional Properties
2.5.1 Salt Release Characterization
The
release of KCOOH, NaCl, and MgCl2 from composite-modified
surfaces was monitored by immersing the samples in water and measuring
the Cl– and K+ ions using ion-selective
electrodes (ISE K 800 and Cl DIN). Composite-incorporated surfaces
were incubated in 12 mL of deionized water, and cumulative release
of the K+ and Cl– ions was measured for
118 days using ion-selective electrodes (WTW potassium combination
electrode K 800 and Cl DIN, respectively) at specific time points.
The total amount of salt released was calculated from measured Cl– and K+ concentrations.26

2.5.2 Characterization of Anti-icing
Properties
of Surfaces
Delays in the icing properties of samples were
investigated through monitoring the duration of freezing of water
on functional composite-incorporated and composite-coated surfaces
separately. For the case of composite-incorporated samples, glass
slides were dip-coated with the functional hydrophobic fluid, and
for the coated samples, glass slides were dip-coated with the unmodified
hydrophobic fluid, followed by spin-coating (SCS—Special Coating
Systems) of 500 μL of functional composite solution (prepared
with NaCl, KCOOH, or MgCl2) at 1000 rpm for 60 s (Figure 1). Water droplets
(50 μL) were placed onto the surface of all samples. Freezing
of water droplets was induced in a temperature-controlled chamber
(Pol-Eko-Apartura) at −2 °C. The freezing process was
monitored by a color area scan camera (JAI) with high-resolution lens
(KOWA). Disappearance of transparency in water droplets was considered
as the time of freezing. Freezing tests on surfaces were performed
twice with the same samples consecutively to elucidate the effects
of the repeated freezing–thawing process on the icing property
of surfaces. After the first freezing test, water droplets were kept
on the surface and evaporated. After the surfaces were fully dry,
new water drops were placed on surfaces for the second freezing test.
Schematics for the preparation steps of composite-incorporated and
composite-coated surfaces are illustrated in Figure 1.

2.5.3 Ice Adhesion Test
An ice adhesion
test was performed to determine the effects of different salts on
the adhesion strength. Water droplets (50 μL) were placed on
the surface of unmodified, coated, and polymer composite-incorporated
samples and frozen. Next, samples were placed in a spin-coater (SCS—Special
Spin-Coating Systems) and spun at 1000 rpm. Samples were examined
to determine the time for the removal of ice from the surface with
constant centrifugal force. Experiments were repeated at least four
times, and the average duration of adhesion for each sample was recorded.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Fluorescence,
Light, and Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) Characterization
Emulsions were prepared
by dispersing the aqueous phase of NaCl, MgCl2, and KCOOH
in the continuous phase. Next, emulsions were casted on Petri dishes
to obtain dry composite membranes. Composite-incorporated hydrophobic
fluids were prepared with either incorporation of the composite within
the hydrophobic fluid or coating of the hydrophobic surfaces with
the composite. Fluorescence microscopy was used to infer the SBS morphology
in composite-incorporated surfaces, whereas the surface morphology
of composite-coated surfaces was investigated with SEM. The morphologies
of SBS in composite-incorporated surfaces were investigated under
fluorescence microscopy. The macroscopic appearance of composite membranes
is demonstrated with the corresponding microscopic image of emulsions,
fluorescence microscopy images of surfaces prepared with incorporation
of the composite into the hydrophobic fluid, and SEM images of surfaces
prepared with composite coating of hydrophobic surfaces in Figure 2. SEM images of the
unmodified hydrophobic surface are demonstrated in Figure S1. We observed that emulsions prepared with KCOOH
or MgCl2 are more stable and have more uniform morphology
compared to those of the ones prepared with NaCl. This difference
resulted in the formation of uniform structures in composite membranes
prepared with KCOOH or MgCl2. The difference could be attributed
to the effects of high concentration of salt on emulsion stability,
which was also reported in previous studies.28−30 For example,
the effect of various ionic salts including NaCl, CaCl2, KCl, NaCH3CO2, and NaNO3 on water–seed
oil emulsion stability were investigated, and decreases in the stability
of emulsions as well as separation of water from oil were observed.28 In our study, the amount of mass used for each
salt was kept constant and NaCl has the highest concentration among
other salts because of its low molecular weight. Thus, the higher
concentration of NaCl might have compromised the stability of emulsions.
Another possible reason might be the negative influence of Na+ ions on the agar gel network. In a previous study, sodium
sulfate was shown to damage the integrity of agarose gel.29 In our study, high concentrations of Na+ affected agar gel negatively and resulted in the formation
of nonuniform structures in composite membranes. This result is also
consistent with our SEM observations, where we observed spherical,
gel-like, and embedded agar domains when surfaces were coated with
KCOOH- or MgCl2-containing composites. These domains appeared
as rigid in the NaCl-containing composite, which could be due to insufficient
gelation of agar at high concentration of sodium ions.

hydrophobic fluid, and (d) SEM images of composite-coated hydrophobic
surfaces prepared with different ionic salts, scale bar = 100 μm.

3.2 Energy-Dispersive
X-ray (EDX) Characterization
Composite-coated hydrophobic
surfaces were examined with EDX for
elemental analysis. Spherelike domains observed on composite-coated
hydrophobic surfaces were analyzed for the presence of salt. Both
inside and outside of these domains were tracked for elemental analysis
of the particular salt to confirm proper encapsulation of ionic salt
within each domain. Figure 3 demonstrates EDX spectra of the inner and outer regions of
the spherelike domains on hydrophobic surfaces. Those surfaces coated
with emulsions of altered ionic salts were presented along with their
corresponding SEM images. Figure 3B,C includes EDX characterization from outside and
inside ionic salt domains on hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. The
peak found for the K+ element on the KCOOH salt-containing
composite-coated surfaces is an indication of the presence of KCOOH
inside the spherelike domain. The fact that the K element was not
detected outside the spherelike domains proved once more that ionic
salt was only dissolved in the hydrophilic agar gel phase during the
preparation of the emulsion and that spreading of salt toward uncoated
regions of the surface did not occur. Similarly, Na+ and
Cl– were observed inside the spherelike domains
for the NaCl-containing composite-coated hydrophobic surface and Mg2+ and Cl– were detected for the MgCl2-containing composite-coated hydrophobic surface. These elements
were not present outside the spherelike gel domains.

surfaces coated with composites of
different salts. (a) SEM images, (b) EDX spectra of the hydrophobic
surface outside salt domains, and (c) EDX spectra of the hydrophobic
surface inside salt domains. Red circles indicate the presence of
particular elements.

3.3 Atomic Force Microscopy Characterization of
Surfaces
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans covered areas
of 20 × 20 μm2 in hydrophobic surfaces that
included composite incorporation or coating. Figure 4A demonstrates phase images of surfaces prepared
with the hydrophobic fluid, where two phases, continuous and dispersed
phases, were observed. The other important feature of these hydrophobic
surfaces is the appearance of “bee-shaped structures”,
which can be characterized with AFM microscopy. This bee-shaped feature
was retained with the incorporation of altered ionic salts. These
structures look like strings, which are immersed and emerged in the
surface. The uniform distribution of these features confirmed that
composite-modified hydrophobic surfaces had uniform structures. These
structures also correspond to stiffer parts in the fluid and provide
information about the mechanical properties.31,32 Bee-shaped structures were not observed when hydrophobic surfaces
were coated with composites of altered ionic salts. This was expected,
as bee-shaped features are attributed to the characteristic of hydrophobic
fluid, and by coating, this feature becomes hidden underneath the
coating (Figure 4B).
Nonuniform structures were also observed on coated surfaces because
of the differences in hydrophobicities of the surface and ionic salts.

topography on the surfaces. (b) Surface when the hydrophobic
surface is coated with SBS or composites prepared by altered salts.

3.4 Rheological
Characterization of the Composite-Modified
Fluid
Dynamic mechanical tests were conducted to measure
the viscoelastic properties of the unmodified and modified hydrophobic
fluids. Oscillatory tests were used to measure the viscoelastic parameters,
complex modulus (G*), and the phase angle (δ). G* provides information about the total resistance of a
material to deformation under shear loading, whereas δ is a
measure of viscoelastic balance of the material behavior. δ
is the phase difference between the shear stress and the shear strain
in an oscillatory test and gives information about the ratio of loss
modulus (G″) to storage modulus (G′).33

Isochronal plots of
the complex modulus, G*, versus temperature at 0.02
Hz for unmodified and composite-incorporated hydrophobic fluids are
presented in Figure 5A. According to Figure 5A, there is no significant difference between G*
values of unmodified and composite-incorporated fluids at high temperatures.
However, 1 order of magnitude difference was observed between the
hydrophobic fluid modified with the NaCl-added composite and the other
groups at low temperatures. This difference is an evidence for a minor
decrease in the resistance of the fluid at low temperatures with NaCl
addition into the composite. Despite minor differences in G* values, more distinct decreases were obtained in δ
values at low temperatures with composite incorporation into the hydrophobic
fluid compared to that of unmodified hydrophobic fluid (Figure 5B). Decrease of δ at
low temperatures is an indication of improved elasticity, which is
a desired property for this particular hydrophobic fluid as elasticity
reduces the risk of fracture on surfaces in real-life conditions.

0.02 Hz for the unmodified hydrophobic fluid and ionic salt composite-incorporating
hydrophobic fluids.

3.5 Anti-icing
Property Characterization
In our previous work, we used a
temperature- and humidity-controlled
custom-made chamber with −14 °C plate, with 5–6
°C medium temperature and 50% humidity conditions.26 Despite these challenging conditions, we could
observe significant delays in freezing on modified hydrophobic surfaces
compared to those on unmodified surfaces. In our current study, we
conducted freezing experiments in a temperature-controlled large chamber
that operated similar to realistic ambient conditions during winter.
This cold chamber was integrated with a camera where the temperature
was maintained at −2 °C and uniformly distributed. Freezing
delays on surfaces coated with the unmodified hydrophobic fluid and
composite-modified hydrophobic fluids were investigated by observing
the freezing rate of a water droplet on the surface (Figure 6). Water droplets (50 μL)
were placed onto each hydrophobic surface, and all samples were kept
in the cold chamber. The temperature inside the chamber was also recorded
with thermocouples placed in different parts of the chamber. The freezing
of droplets was monitored with a camera-attached system and recorded.
The freezing time is determined based on the disappearance of transparency
of the droplets.

Figure 6 Monitoring of freezing experiments in the cold chamber
at −2
°C. (a) Photographic image of the camera-attached cold chamber
where samples inside the chamber were observed on the computer screen.
The left bottom image shows inside of the chamber with camera attachment. (b) Freezing
of water droplets on hydrophobic surface (unmodified) and surfaces
prepared with different salt composite-incorporated hydrophobic surfaces
in the cold chamber.

Investigation of the freezing rate of a water droplet on
each surface
was repeated twice sequentially. Water droplets were left on the surface
after each exposure and subsequently evaporated so that ionic salt
would not be washed away with water, and new water droplets were then
added onto the surface for the second exposure measurements.

Freezing delays on surfaces with unmodified, SBS-coated, composite-incorporated,
or composite-coated samples are presented in Figure 7. Coating of hydrophobic surfaces with the
SBS polymer did not have a significant influence on the delay of freezing.
Higher freezing delays were observed on composite-coated hydrophobic
surfaces compared to those on surfaces with composite incorporation.
This result was expected, as water droplets were directly in contact
with the composite layer, which included encapsulated salt molecules.
A higher amount of salt could diffuse out from the composite layer
to water droplets on composite-coated samples compared to that on
composite-incorporated samples. Thus, longer delays in the freezing
were observed on composite-coated hydrophobic surfaces compared to
those on surfaces prepared with composite-incorporating hydrophobic
surfaces. When we compare the effects of altered ionic salts in composite-coated
samples, the highest freezing delay was recorded on the NaCl-containing
composite-coated sample. This delay was consistent with the freezing
point depression values of the dispersed phase in parenting emulsions,
where the same amount of salt was used for each case. The degree in
the depression of freezing point of water when an ionic salt is used
can be calculated by the following equation 1  where ΔTF is the amount of decrease
in the freezing temperature (°C); KF is the cryoscopic constant, which is an intrinsic
property of the solute; b is the molality of the
salt solution (mol/kg); and i is the van’t
Hoff factor, which is the number of ions per solute molecule. According
to this expression, the freezing point depression performance of a
particular ionic salt in water is directly proportional to the concentration
of ionic salt and ionization degree of the salt.

Figure 7 Freezing delays of unmodified,
composite-incorporated, and composite-coated
hydrophobic surfaces prepared with different salts in the temperature-controlled
chamber at −2 °C.

On the basis of eq 1, the values presented in Table 1 were obtained for the ionic salts used in
our study.
We expected to observe longest delays in the freezing of water on
surfaces that included the NaCl ionic salt in the composite. However,
in our experiments, this effect was not observed in composite-incorporated
samples, probably due to the differences in the distribution and diffusion
properties of ionic salts in the hydrophobic fluid.

Table 1 Theoretical Amount of Decreases in
Freezing Points Based on 1 for the Aqueous Phase
in Emulsions Prepared with 0.3 g/mL Concentration of Ionic Salt
ionic salt	Kf (°C kg/mol)	b (mol/kg)	i	ΔT (°C)	
KCOOH	1.86	3.566	2	13.26	
NaCl	1.86	5.137	2	19.11	
MgCl2	1.86	3.151	3	17.58	
Freezing tests on surfaces were performed
twice with the same samples
consecutively to demonstrate the effects of the repeated freezing
process on the icing property of surfaces. After the first freezing
test, which was defined as “first exposure”, water droplets
were kept on the surface and evaporated. Once the surfaces were fully
dry after 3 days, new water drops were placed on surfaces for the
second exposure. Hence, up to 1 h, freezing delay occurs as a result
of ionic salt release for 3 days. Similarly, this salt release will
continue even in wetting/drying cycles in following tens of days in
realistic conditions, which will provide continued delays in freezing.
This continued salt release is also demonstrated in Figure 8 where ionic salt release was
measured up to 118 days.

Figure 8 Time-dependent release of KCOOH, NaCl, and MgCl2 from
surfaces prepared with different salt composite-incorporated hydrophobic
fluids.

We also tested freezing delays
of composite-modified hydrophobic
fluid samples with larger sizes prepared in Petri dishes (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information) using
6 mL of water films and a lower freezing test temperature, −8
°C, where the larger amount of water takes a longer time to freeze
and provides more detailed comparison among altered surfaces. We observed
higher freezing delays for surfaces prepared with KCOOH (Figure S4). This observation is also consistent
with our earlier experiments where the amount of KCOOH release is
higher than that of NaCl or MgCl2 after a week-long incubation
of samples in water (Figure 8).

In addition to anti-icing experiments, ice adhesion
tests were
performed to determine the adhesion strength of ice on modified and
unmodified surfaces. Removal of ice from modified surfaces by centrifugal
force is a commonly applied method for the assessment of ice adhesion.34 To test the ice adhesion strength, we used centrifugal
force at 1000 rpm and recorded the time for the detachment of ice
droplets from the surface. Whereas the unmodified surface could keep
the ice on its surface for 15.5 s, ice detached earlier from salt
composite-incorporated samples (Figure S5). The early detachment of ice from the polymer composite-incorporated
samples is the result of a decreased ice adhesion force between the
surface and the ice in the presence of an anti-icing component.25 On the other hand, for the coated samples, ice
detachment was observed later at 22 s for KCOOH and NaCl composite-coated
samples. However, for MgCl2 composite-coated samples, ice
detachment was not observed. This is attributed to the interaction
of the MgCl2 composite with the water layer at the ice–coating
interphase. Because of this reason, we did not include MgCl2-coated samples in our ice adhesion figure (Figure S5). When the surface is coated with the polymer composite,
water droplets placed on the surface can interact with the hydrophilic
domains of the polymer. This results in direct melting of the frozen
water droplet on the surface rather than detachment from the surface
as a solid entity. Previous research findings show that increased
roughness results in increased ice adhesion.35 Because the amount of polymer composite is much larger on the surface
for the coated samples, surface roughness is also enhanced. Therefore,
ice adhesion at the interface of ice and composite is reinforced.

3.6 Characterization of Ionic Salt Release from
Functional Surfaces
The release of KCOOH, NaCl, and MgCl2 from composite-modified hydrophobic surfaces was investigated
by placing surfaces in water and measuring the Cl– and K+ ions using ion-selective electrodes. Cl– and K+ ion concentrations were measured at specific time
points, and the amount of salts released was calculated from the measured
values of Cl– and K+ concentrations.
The amount of ionic salt released at specific time points is shown
in Figure 8. We observed
that salt release from composite-modified hydrophobic surfaces reached
saturation after 118 days. This result shows that freezing delays
on composite-incorporated hydrophobic surfaces are expected to increase
after 118 days because of the accumulation of salts on the surface.
However, significant increase is not expected in the case of composite-coated
hydrophobic surfaces because there is no continuous salt diffusion
from underlying layers of hydrophobic medium. The highest amount of
salt release was observed from the KCOOH-containing surface after
118 days. This can be explained by the two possible reasons: (1) KCOOH
was incorporated within the composite in the hydrophobic fluid uniformly
and (2) compared to those of other salts, KCOOH diffusion rates in
the hydrophobic fluid were higher. This result shows that the addition
of KCOOH in the composite-incorporated hydrophobic fluid can result
in better anti-icing performance compared to that of the other ionic
salts for long periods of time.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we investigated anti-icing properties of different
ionic salts in composite-modified hydrophobic fluids. We both incorporated
composites into hydrophobic fluids and coated hydrophobic surfaces
with our composite to investigate and compare the performance of delayed
icing properties of alternative approaches. We observed higher delays
in the freezing on composite-coated samples compared to those observed
on composite-incorporating surfaces. The samples modified with composites
that contained NaCl resulted in higher delays in freezing when concentrations
of ionic salts were kept constant. These results suggested that delays
in freezing could be tuned with the type and concentration of the
anti-icing agent incorporation into the composite.

We also investigated
the effect of particular ionic salt on the
mechanical and morphological properties of the composite-incorporated
or -coated hydrophobic surfaces. We obtained stable emulsions and
surfaces with uniform morphologies when composites were prepared with
KCOOH or MgCl2. The complex modulus of hydrophobic fluid
was not affected significantly with the type of ionic salt. On the
other hand, composite-modified hydrophobic fluids showed improved
elastic properties. A comparison of ionic salts to delay ice formation
on surfaces demonstrated the possibilities and potential of using
alternative salts for inducing anti-icing behavior on surfaces. Comparison
of the application methods of the anti-icing agents into the hydrophobic
fluids (surface incorporation or surface coating) suggested that desirable
delays in freezing could be achieved with the most appropriate approach.
