We recently showed, using chemically
specific modeling and simulation,
how the process of intercalation of polymers within clay sheets occurs,
transforming the large-scale materials properties by a specific set
of spatial and temporal processes that can lead to exfoliation. Here,
we use the same hierarchal multiscale modeling scheme to understand
the processes that occur during the shear-induced processing of clay–polymer
nanocomposites. For both hydrophobic polymers (polyethylene) and hydrophilic
polymers (poly(ethylene glycol)), we used free-energy methods to identify
the lowest-free-energy separation of the clay sheets; the polymer
molecules spontaneously intercalate into the clay interlayer from
the surrounding polymer melt. We apply shear forces to investigate
exfoliation and find that while exfoliation is promoted by shearing,
it is the surfactant molecules that play the dominant role in resisting
it.

Introduction
The central goal of
theory, modeling, and simulation in materials
science and engineering is to predict the large-scale properties of
materials on the basis of chemical composition and processing conditions.1−3 In the field of nanocomposites, we would like to be able to predict
whether it is possible to disperse the solid phase; for clay–polymer
nanocomposites, and other two-dimensional nanomaterials, improvement
in the elastic properties of the nanocomposite is greatest when the
two-dimensional layers are fully dispersed, exposing the maximum surface
area to the surrounding polymeric matrix.4−7 The difficulty lies in the small
spacing between the clay layers, which is of order 1 nm (compared
to lateral dimensions of 10 nm to microns). Grafting surfactants to
clay surfaces is a common step in the processing of clay–polymer
nanocomposites. This approach facilitates the delamination and exfoliation
of clay minerals when they are aggregated into stacks, called tactoids4,5 by increasing the gallery spacing and allowing polymer penetration.
Shear forces are also often required, however, to remove individual
clay layers from the tactoid through methods such as extrusion processing.

There is, therefore, much interest in determining the conditions
that increase the gallery spacing and promote exfoliation. Previous
theoretical efforts in examining the thermodynamics of clay–polymer
nanocomposites include lattice mean-field models developed by Vaia
and Giannelis,8,9 which calculated the enthalpic
and entropic contributions to the expansion of surfactant-treated
two-clay-layer systems and their subsequent penetration by long-chain
polymers. They showed that there is a substantial loss of entropy
for confined intercalating polymers, which can be compensated by an
increase in enthalpy for properly selected surfactants. Subsequently,
Balazs and co-workers applied lattice self-consistent field theory
(SCFT) to examine nanocomposite morphologies as a function of the
density and length of the surfactants and polymer molecular weight.10−12 They found that even for negative Flory–Huggins interaction
parameters between the components, for long polymer chains, only intercalated
nanocomposites were formed. For low surfactant molecular weight and
for the surfactant and polymer possessing the same chemistry, the
system was found to be immiscible.

However, such models lack
atomistic detail, being defined by polymer-mediated
contributions to the particle-pair potential. There could be contributions
from longer-range clay–clay interactions and excluded volume
interactions, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations of clay surfaces.13−17 In this study, we build upon our previous work studying the intercalation
of polymer molecules into clay tactoids2 to perform detailed molecular modeling of clay–polymer nanocomposites
to address the exfoliation of these systems. We use large-scale coarse-grained
molecular dynamics (CG-MD) to observe, for the first time, the process
of intercalation and the formation of intercalated and exfoliated
polymer–clay composite systems. Here, we apply these methods
to examine the role of surfactants and polymers in the exfoliation
process. Surfactants not only reduce the adhesion between layers but
also alter their lubrication and friction properties.18−21 The shear stress required to delaminate the clay layers must overcome
the residual adhesive forces to form exfoliated particles.22−24 In the case of intercalated clay layers, these adhesive forces result
from a combination of surfactant and polymer molecules, which reside
on the surface of the clay as well as within the interlayer spacing.
The role of the adsorbed and free polymer in determining the exfoliation
properties of clay layers has been hitherto unknown.

We use
the coarse-grained MD technique to simulate a clay platelet
immersed in a reservoir of polymer melt (see Figure 1a) to address this problem. No assumptions
about the equilibrium separation of the clay platelets and the density
of polymer molecules within the interlayer are made. The chemical
potential of the surrounding polymer melt is therefore included in
our simulation, and it is this that drives the evolution of the system,
including intercalation and shear-induced exfoliation. As the polymer
molecules intercalate, they adopt conformations, which are partially
within the clay interlayer spacing and partially outside (see Figure 1b).

Figure 1 (a) Initial setup of
the clay–polymer CG system used in
this study. The surfactant molecules are shown in red, clay CG pseudoatoms
are cyan, and clay edge CG pseudoatoms are yellow. The two-clay-layer
system is in the center of a box of molten polymer (each polymer CG
atom is represented by a blue dot). Two highlighted polymer molecules
illustrate the amorphous nature of the polymer matrix (blue spheres).
The dimensions of the simulation box are approximately 200 ×
200 × 200 Å3. (b) Diagram illustrating the different
configurations of adsorbed polymers and surfactants in the interlayer
spacing. The clay layers are shown as thick blue lines, the surfactant
head groups as brown squares, the surfactant tails as red lines, and
the adsorbed polymers as black lines. Surfactant tails can interact
with surfactant tails that are attached, via their head groups, to
the opposite surface, to effectively form bridges across the interlayer
spacing. (c) A schematic diagram illustrating our procedure for computing
the free energy of separation (reaction coordinate is the red line)
and shear simulations of clay layers A and B (force is applied to
clay layer A in the x direction). Only the clay layers
are illustrated; surfactant and polymer molecules are not shown.

We use free-energy methods to
calculate the equilibrium separation
between clay sheets and then investigate the shear force required
to exfoliate a clay layer. In this way, we are able to dissect those
processes, which promote and inhibit exfoliation.

Modeling Methods
To exemplify shear-induced polymer-driven exfoliation of organophilic
clays in a chemically specific manner, we study montmorillonite clay
with a variety of quaternary ammonium surfactants and molten polymers.
We consider two polymers for the matrix: hydrophilic poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG)25−28 and hydrophobic polyethene (PE). For surfactants, we consider the
dimethyldioctadecylammonium ionic surfactant, denoted NC182, which has two long hydrophobic alkyl chains (each of length C18, chemically identical to the PE polymer) and a surfactant
containing two chains made of PEG monomer units (hence, chemically
identical to the free PEG polymer), denoted NPEG2. The
quaternary ammonium ions interact strongly with the charged sites
on the clay surface and can be considered to be tethered surfactants.
All polymer molecules used in this study are 100 monomer units long,
ensuring that we are in the entanglement regime for the polymer molecules.
All simulations were performed at the elevated temperature of 500
K and a pressure of 100 atm, associated with melt processing.

The procedure to create the CG interaction parameters has been
described in our previous studies.1,2 The CG interaction
parameters are calculated from numerous small atomistic simulations
and are designed to match structural details including radial distributions
functions and density profiles perpendicular to the clay surface1 using Iterative Boltzmann Inversion.29−31 Each clay layer consists of 672 CG pseudoatoms with lateral dimensions
of approximately 140 × 100 Å2. To examine the
role of clay surface charge density, which in turn affects the density
of charge-balancing surfactants on the clay surface, we consider four
different isomorphic substitution percentages in the clay framework.
These correspond to substituting Al3+ ions with Mg2+ ions in the octahedral sheet of the clay framework. Table 1 lists various aspects
of the models used in the study and the nomenclature we use to identify
them.

a The lowest-free-energy separation
is calculated using umbrella sampling, with the reaction coordinate
perpendicular to the clay sheet.

A snapshot of the two-clay-layer system used is shown in Figure 1a. Each simulation
contains approximately 77 000 CG particles, corresponding to
540 000 atoms. The simulation box is approximately 200 Å3, and the polymers are built using a Monte-Carlo growth program,
we described previously.1 There are 717
polymer molecules in each model. The density of the polymer phase
is approximately 0.62 g/mL, assuming 20% of the simulation box volume
is occupied by the clay platelet. All simulations were performed using
the LAMMPS code.32 To calculate the Gibbs
free energy, the difference in the z coordinates
of clay layers A and B, i.e., the separation between the basal planes
of the clay layers (see Figure 1c), is used as the reaction coordinate. Umbrella sampling
is used to calculate the free energy as a function of layer separation,
with the free energy reconstructed using the WHAM method.33 For the shear simulations, a snapshot from the
basal-plane separation simulation is selected at the lowest-free-energy
separation. One clay layer is fixed, and a force is imposed equally
to all atoms in the other clay layer in the x direction
at every timestep of the molecular dynamics simulation. We observe
how far the clay layer A moves with this additional force by calculating
the difference in the x coordinates of the center
of mass of the clay layers. For more details on our simulation procedure,
see Supporting Information (SI).

Results
and Discussion
In the following section, we examine the changes
that occur in
the interlayer gallery during expansion and describe the consequences
of the configurations of adsorbed polymer and surfactant molecules
for resisting the shear-induced separation of clay layer.

Free Energy
of Basal-Plane Separation
Our simulations
show the following results: when the surrounding polymer is hydrophilic
(PEG), and there are no surfactant molecules in the clay galleries
(only Na+ ions), the thermodynamically lowest-energy state
is for a bilayer of polymer to intercalate. When the surfactant and
the polymer are chemically identical (either PEG or PE based), the
clay galleries expand to form a tri- or quad-layer in the clay interlayer
spacing, but there is no polymer density in the center of the clay
galleries. The surfactant and the polymer molecules are immiscible,
and intercalation is restricted to the very edges of the clay tactoid.
This immiscibility is consistent with the SCFT model of Balazs et
al.,10 although we observe a slight increase
from the unintercalated d-spacing (∼23 Å)
due to small amount of polymer intercalation on the edges of the clay.
When the surrounding polymer is hydrophilic and the surfactant tails
are hydrophobic (i.e., PE based), the clay galleries expand considerably,
the surfactant molecules lengthen to almost their full extent, and
the surrounding polymer intercalates onto the surface of the clay
sheet, forming up to six layers in the interlayer spacing (see SI for atomic density profiles perpendicular
to the clay surface). These results are shown in Figure 2. It should be noted that there
are valleys and peaks in the high-energy regions in the free-energy
profiles; these are poorly sampled regions, so we cannot draw any
conclusions about the shape of profile at these separations. With
a longer length of simulation between each d-spacing
point in the umbrella sampling, it might be possible to have more
confidence in these high-energy areas, but the time scale of our simulations
is sufficient to draw conclusions on the position and shape of the
lowest-free-energy regions in the free-energy profile, as discussed
above.

Figure 2 Free energies of clay-layer separation. (a) Hydrophilic polymer
systems: blue line, Na+ and PEG polymer; red line, NC182 surfactant and PEG polymer (9% substitution rate); light
blue line, NC182 surfactant and PEG polymer (12.5% substitution
rate). (b) Identical surfactant backbone and polymer systems: red
line, NPEG2 surfactant and PEG polymer; blue line, NC182 surfactant and PE polymer.

The behavior described above can be understood by considering
the
balance between the various thermodynamic contributions.8,9 When the enthalpic interactions between the clay surface and the
surfactants are the same as those of the polymer and the clay surface,
there is an entropic penalty for the polymer molecules to intercalate
into the confined space between the clay sheets, and hence, gallery
expansion is unfavorable. When the interaction between the polymer
and the clay sheet is favorable, this entropic penalty is overcome,
and the clay sheet interlayer spacing increases to accommodate the
polymer molecules. There is also a gain in conformational entropy
of the surfactants, which can now extend further from the surface.
However, at a distance of 40–50 Å, the surfactant molecules
are almost fully extended, and there is no further entropic gain from
expansion. These detailed molecular simulations are in agreement with
SCFT models, which showed that favorable interactions between surfactant
and polymer can lead to intercalated structures.6,10

Application of Shear
To determine the properties of
the clay layers under processing conditions, we performed calculations
to determine the minimum shear force required to separate clay layers.
First, we consider the case where the surfactant and the surrounding
polymer are chemically identical (NC182 surfactant and
PE polymer). For this model, we examine the clay tactoid at its lowest-free-energy
clay sheet separation (28 Å) (see Figure 3a) and, for comparison, at a high separation
of 44 Å where the clay surface and surfactants of the two layers
can be considered as noninteracting (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 Shear-induced exfoliation of the NC182 surfactant and
PE polymer system. (a) Illustration of our shear-induced exfoliation
simulation for the PE polymer and NC182 surfactant system
at a d-spacing of 28 Å. The highlighted surfactant
molecules bridge between the clay layers. (b) A snapshot from simulation
of one of the clay layers with noninteracting clay layers (d-spacing separation of 48 Å). The difference in x component of the center of mass of clay layers during
the shearing simulations as a function of force added to each atom
in the upper clay layer applied at each timestep for a d-spacing of (c) 28 Å and (d) 48 Å. The colors in (c) are
as follows: black, 0.01 kcal/(mol Å); red, 0.025 kcal/(mol Å);
blue, 0.03 kcal/(mol Å); green, 0.0325 kcal/(mol Å). The
colors in (d) are as follows: black, 0.005 kcal/(mol Å); red,
0.01 kcal/(mol Å).

In Figure 3c, we
show the displacement as a result of different forces applied to the
upper layer of our two-clay-layer system. At the lowest-energy separation,
we find that the greater the force, the greater the shift of the upper
platelet, and rupture, defined as the upper clay sheet moving more
than 50 Å, occurs at 0.0325 kcal/(mol Å). When the clay
sheets are noninteracting, in each case the applied force separates
the clay sheets, and the distance traveled by the upper sheet in a
specified time is proportional to the force applied (Figure 3d). These simulations indicate
that there is significant entanglement of the surfactant molecules
at the lowest-energy separation and a relatively large force is required
to overcome these adhesive forces; resistance is completely removed
when the sheets are far enough apart that the surfactant molecules
do not interact. In Figure 3a, we highlight the considerable number of surfactant molecules
that act as a bridge between the two clay surfaces at the lowest-energy
clay separation. These bridges, and interactions between the surfactant
molecules, resist the rupture of the clay tactoid; considerable force
is required to desorb these molecules.

When polymer molecules
intercalate into the clay gallery, the conformation
of the polymer might also play a role in determining the resistance
to shear exfoliation. These intercalated conformations are commonly
described in terms of trains, loops, tails, and bridges: trains are
in contact with a clay layer, loops dangle from a surface into solution
between two trains, whereas tails are not in contact with the surface
but extend into the melt. A bridge arises between two trains on different
surfaces. A schematic diagram of these configurations is shown in Figure 1b. In the following
section, we describe the influence of these different configurations
on the resistance to shear exfoliation. In Figure 4a, we illustrate the displacement of the
upper sheet under shear force for the surfactant–polymer combination
of N182 surfactant and PEG polymer.

Figure 4 Shear-induced exfoliation
of the NC182 surfactant and
PEG polymer system. (a) Difference in x component
of the center of mass of clay layers at a d-spacing
of 42 Å, a force added to each atom in the top clay layer of
0.02 kcal/(mol Å) (green line) and 0.03 kcal/(mol Å) (blue
line). (b) Modified simulations, started from the unmodified simulation
after 40 ns (the green curve in (a)). The colors are as follows: black,
removal of bonded interactions in the polymer molecules; blue, removal
of the bridging polymer molecules; brown, removal of bonded interactions
between the surfactant molecules; orange, an unmodified simulation,
starting at a greater clay-layer separation (55 Å). (c) An example
of a bridging polymer molecule, subsequently removed in the black
line simulation in (b). (d) A snapshot from simulation where all bonded
interactions (i.e., bonds, angles, and dihedrals) within the polymer
molecules have been removed, thereby turning all polymer molecules
into monomers (polymer molecules not shown in the visualization).

In contrast to the case where
the surfactant backbone and the polymer
molecules are chemically identical, with a hydrophilic polymer and
hydrophobic surfactant, we find that the separation between the clay
layers gradually increases as larger forces are applied to the upper
clay layer. For the highest applied force (0.03 kcal/(mol Å)),
the separation increases in a stepwise fashion, until rupture occurs
after 18 ns. A similar trend is seen with an applied force of 0.02
kcal/(mol Å), with shear-induced exfoliation occurring at 50
ns. These forces are lower than the lowest force required to exfoliate
the clay layer when the surfactant backbone and the polymer molecules
are identical.

To analyze the factors inhibiting shear-induced
exfoliation, we
have modified the interactions present in our simulations to observe
the effect on shear-induced exfoliation. We use as our starting structure
the 0.02 kcal/(mol Å) force simulation (the green line in Figure 4a) at 40 ns, which
is approximately 10 ns before the separation in the clay layers increases
dramatically due to the applied shear force. We removed polymer molecules,
which form bridges across the interlayer (defined as polymer molecules
with density within 9.5 Å of both clay surfaces), an example
of which is shown in Figure 4c. Restarting the simulation without the bridging polymers
makes only a small difference to the shear-induced time profile, with
separation still occurring 10 ns after the restart (blue line in Figure 4b). Thus, bridging
polymer molecules only play a minor role in determining the resistance
to shear exfoliation. Second, we removed all bonded interactions within
polymer molecules, thereby turning all polymers into monomers units.
This has the effect of removing all of the loops and bridges on each
clay surface. In Figure 4b, we see that this process actually reduces the separation (black
line); i.e., it increases the friction between the layers. It is,
therefore, clear that the polymer molecules are not the main reason
for the resistance to shear. To test the dependence on the surfactant
interactions, we removed all bonds within the surfactant molecules,
which led to a spontaneous increase in shear-induced separation (purple
line in Figure 4b).
Furthermore, we repeated the simulation using a snapshot from the
free energy of separation simulation of the N182 surfactant
and PEG polymer system with a z separation of 55
Å, a distance at which there is no interaction between surfactants
tethered to opposite surfaces, but there are bridging polymer molecules.
In both cases, there is no resistance to shear-induced exfoliation,
and the distance between the clay layers increases rapidly, again
indicating that the interaction between the surfactant molecules is
the determining factor in resisting shear-induced exfoliation. In Figure 4d, we illustrate
the overlap between surfactant molecules tethered to opposite surfaces,
thereby indicating their interaction, through a snapshot from one
of our simulations.

Conclusions
We have examined the
factors that affect the swelling of pretreated
clay layers using multiscale methods to elucidate the processes that
resist shear-induced exfoliation. Because they are initially added
to promote expansion of clay layers, somewhat surprisingly we find
the surfactant molecules dominate the mechanism by which clay layers
resist exfoliation in their expanded state. For clays with surfactants
that are chemically identical to the surrounding polymer, there is
no thermodynamic driving force for polymer to intercalate, so the
interlayer is dominated by strongly interacting surfactants. Only
large shear forces are able to overcome these interactions. For clays
with surfactants that possess favourable interactions with the surrounding
polymer, although the thermodynamically stable d-spacing
is much expanded through intercalation, the surfactant molecules from
opposite surfaces interact strongly, in turn inhibiting shear-driven
exfoliation. The force required to exfoliate is less than that for
unintercalated clay platelets. Under shear, surfactant–surfactant
interactions are gradually broken and the surfactants eventually untangle.
By contrast, the polymer plays no role in resisting exfoliation.

We can compare the minimum shear force we have found in our simulations
to those estimated to occur in processing conditions. According to
the analysis of Borse and Kamal,23 the
typical shear rates in extrusion processing are between 1 and 100
s–1, although higher rates can be found within an
extruder. The viscosity of most polymers during extrusion is between
1000 and 2000 Pa s. Thus, the maximum available shear stress is of
order 2 × 105 N/m2. The surface area of
our clay systems is approximately 140 × 100 Å2, and each clay layer contains 672 coarse-grained atoms. The minimum
force required to break apart the clay tactoids in our simulations
was 0.02 kcal/(mol Å) per atom; this leads to a shear stress
(i.e., total applied force/surface area) of approximately 6.4 ×
105 N/m2, which is comparable to those found
in extruders. Assuming that the force per atom required to exfoliate
the clay layer is independent of the number of atoms in the clay layer,
this value should be platelet size independent. Of course, our estimates
are likely to be an upper bound, there may be other directions that
require less force and, as we have shown, the duration of the applied
force is important; lower forces may still cause shear-induced exfoliation
over longer time scales than we can access here with the computing
resources available to us.

In conclusion, we have shown that
surfactants, while necessary
to help initial intercalation, strongly resist the subsequent shear-induced
exfoliation.
