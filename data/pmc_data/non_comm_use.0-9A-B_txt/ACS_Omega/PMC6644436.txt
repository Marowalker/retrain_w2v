Reactions
of Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a, Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3) with 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 equiv of Ar′OH
(Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(OAr′), Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(OAr′)2,
or Nb(NAr)(OAr′)3, respectively (at 25 °C),
whereas the reaction with 2.0 equiv of 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(O-2,6-tBu2C6H3) upon heating (70 °C) without the formation of bis(phenoxide)
and the reaction of 3a with 2.0 equiv of 2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,4,6-Me3C6H2)2(HN=CtBu2). Similar reactions of 3a with 1.0 equiv of (CF3)3COH or 2.0 equiv of
(CF3)2CHOH afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2[OC(CF3)3](HN=CtBu2)
or Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)[OCH(CF3)2]2(HN=CtBu2), respectively. On the basis of their structural
analyses and the reaction chemistry, it was suggested that these reactions
proceeded via coordination of phenol (alcohol) to Nb and the subsequent
proton (hydrogen) transfer to the ketimide (N=CtBu2) ligand. The reaction of Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(OAr′)
with 1.0 equiv of 2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH
gave the disproportionation products Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(OAr′)2 and Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,4,6-Me3C6H2)2(HN=CtBu2) with 1:1 ratio, clearly indicating
the presence of the above mechanism and the fast equilibrium (between
the ketimide and the phenoxide). The reaction of 3a with
1.0 or 2.0 equiv of C6F5OH afforded Nb(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)3(HN=CtBu2) as the sole isolated product, which was formed from
once generated Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)(HN=CtBu2) by treating with C6F5OH.

Introduction
Arylimido ligands have
been widely used to stabilize the high-oxidation-state
early transition-metal complexes,1−10 which are especially used as catalysts or catalyst precursors for
carbon–carbon bond formation exemplified in olefin metathesis,6−10 and olefin polymerization.11,12 Introduction of a steric
bulk in the arylimido ligand should be effective not only to stabilize
the oxidation state, but also to avoid the formation of dimeric species
through the bridged imido ligand or certain dimeric decomposition
pathways in metal-alkylidenes;4,6−9 the ligand modification is also effective to control the electronic
nature through the metal–nitrogen double bond.6−8,10,13 Monodentate anionic ancillary donor ligands (such as phenoxy,10,14−16 ketimide,15−19 imidazolin-2-iminato,20 and others15,16,21,22) have also been known to play a role to stabilize the oxidation
state as well as control of electronic/steric natures by the ligand
modification.10,15,16

Studies on the synthesis and some reaction chemistry of half-sandwich
niobium complexes containing arylimido ligands,23−31 which would exhibit metallocene-like reactivity through the “isolobal”
relationship,25 were known. Moreover, synthesis
of some (called nonmetallocene type) (arylimido)niobium(V) complexes,32−40 especially those containing monoanionic chelate guanidinato ligand
(Scheme 1),37−39 was also known. However, in contrast to a number of reports of (tert-butyl-imido)niobium complexes especially containing
β-diketiminate ligand (Scheme 1),41−44 reports concerning the synthesis and reaction chemistry of (arylimido)niobium(V)
complexes containing “monodentate” anionic ancillary
donor ligands still have been limited so far (Scheme 1).32−34,40 Since certain (arylimido)vanadium(V) complexes containing anionic
donor ligands (such as phenoxy, ketimide, imidazoline-iminato) exhibit
promising characteristics as catalysts or catalyst precursors for
olefin metathesis9,10,13,45 and coordination/insertion polymerization12,46−49 and also (arylimido)niobium(V)-alkylidene complexes containing fluorinated
alkoxo ligand catalyze metathesis polymerization of cyclic olefins
and disubstituted acetylene (Scheme 1),40 synthesis and some
reactions of (arylimido)niobium(V) complexes containing ketimide and
aryloxo ligands have been a promising subject.50−52

Examples for (Arylimido)niobium(V) Complexes,32−34,38−40 and Selected
Four-, Five-, and Six-Coordinate (t-Butylimido)niobium
Complexes41,42
In this study, we thus focus on the synthesis of (arylmido)niobium(V)
complexes containing ketimide (N=CtBu2) ligand, not only because use of this ligand plays
a role to stabilize the oxidation state,50 as demonstrated by the synthesis of a series of (arylimido)vanadium(V)
complexes,9,53−55 but also because, as
described below, the solvent-free tris(ketimide) complex, Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a), could be isolated from Nb(NAr)Cl3(dme) (Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3, dme = 1,2-dimethoxyethane) and
subsequent substitution with phenol was expected.54,55

Moreover, on the basis of the reaction chemistry of V(NAr)Me(N=CtBu2)2 with phenols,
it was demonstrated that the reactions of ketimide with phenols proceed
by coordination with phenol and not by protonation (protonolysis,
H+) and also proceed by coordination of phenol to the electron-deficient
metal center trans to the methyl group to give a pentacoordinated
trigonal bipyramidal species and subsequent proton (hydrogen) transfer
to the aryloxide/ketimide affording ketimine/phenol dissociation.55−58 Therefore, we herein present our explored reaction chemistry of
the (arylimido)niobium(V)-ketimide complexes with phenols and the
unique contrast in the reactivity between the vanadium and niobium
complexes.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of (Arylimido)niobium(V) Complexes
Containing Phenoxide,
Ketimide Ligands, and Some Reactions with Phenols and Fluorinated
Alcohols
Reactions of (imido)niobium(V) trichloride, Nb(NR′)Cl3(dme) [R′ = 2,6-Me2C6H3 (Ar),40 2,6-iPr2C6H3 (Ar′),32,33 1-adamantyl (Ad),32,33 dme = 1,2-dimethoxyethane] with
LiOAr′ in Et2O afforded corresponding Nb(NR′)Cl2(OAr′)(dme) (Scheme 2, R′ = Ar (1a), Ar′ (1b), Ad (1c)) in high yields (76–84%),
and the reaction of Nb(NAr)Cl3(dme) with Li(O-2,6-Ph2C6H3) also afforded Nb(NAr)Cl2(O-2,6-Ph2C6H3)(dme) (1d).a These complexes were identified by NMR
spectra and elemental analysis (except 1b),a and the structures of 1a and 1d were determined by X-ray crystallography as a distorted octahedral
geometry around niobium.b It turned out that
both 1a and 1d showed low catalytic activities
for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO)
(activities for 1a and 1d = 23 and 12 kg
PE/(mol Nb h), respectively, ethylene 8 atm at 25 °C for 1 h).c The reason for the low catalytic activities would
be coordination of dme, which seems difficult to cleave from Nb, as
described below.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of (Imido)niobium(V) Complexes Containing
Aryloxide, Ketimide,
and Triflate (OTf) Ligands (Detailed Synthetic Procedures Are Shown
in the Supporting Information (SI))a,b
It turned out that dme was strongly coordinated
to Nb in CDCl3 even at 100 °C (variable-temperature
spectra are shown
in Figure S2-1, Supporting Information
(SI)),a and attempted treatments of 1a with NiBr2 or ZnCl2 (3 equiv) in toluene at
50 °C recovered 1a. Treatment of 1a with 2 equiv of AgOTf (OTf = CF3SO3) in CH2Cl2 afforded corresponding Nb(NAr)(OAr′)(OTf)2(dme) (2a) without liberation of dme (Scheme 2); 2a was identified by NMR spectra and elemental analysis.a Similarly, Nb(NAr)Cl3(dme) was treated with 3
equiv of AgOTf in CH2Cl2 to afford Nb(NAr)(OTf)3(dme) (2b), which was also isolated as the sole
product confirmed by NMR spectra.a Structure
of 2a was suggested on the basis of that of 1a (confirmed by X-ray crystallography) and the NMR spectra, but two
resonances were observed in the 19F NMR spectrum when the
CDCl3 solution was kept at room temperature (25 °C)
for 21 h, probably due to isomerization of the OTf ligand (trans to
cis, the spectra are shown in Figure S2-3, SI).a

In contrast, reactions of Nb(NAr)Cl3(dme) with 3.0 equiv
of Li(N=CtBu2) in toluene
afforded the corresponding four-coordinate tris(ketimide) analogue,
Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a), and treatment of NbCl5 with
3.0 equiv of Li(N=CtBu2) in toluene also afforded trans-NbCl2(N=CtBu2)3 (3b) as the sole isolated product (Scheme 2).a These
complexes (3a and 3b) were identified by
NMR spectra and elemental analysis.a

As
described in Introduction, reports concerning
synthesis and reaction chemistry of (arylimido)niobium(V) complexes
containing monodentate anionic donor ligands (without solvent coordination)
still have been limited (Scheme 1).32−34,40,50 Since the ketimide (N=CtBu2) ligand in the (arylimido)vanadium(V) complexes were known
to be replaced with phenoxide (alkoxide) upon addition of phenol (alcohol),
reactions of Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a) with phenols were thus conducted.a

It turned out that reaction of 3a with 1.0 equiv of
Ar′OH in n-hexane afforded the mono phenoxide,
Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(OAr′) (4a), as the sole isolated product
(Scheme 3).a The similar reactions with 2.0 and 3.0 equiv of
Ar′OH afforded the corresponding bis- and tris(phenoxide) complexes,
Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(OAr′)2 (5) and Nb(NAr)(OAr′)3 (6), respectively, in high yields (Scheme 3);a the reaction of
Nb(NAr)Cl3(dme) with 3.0 equiv of LiOAr′ in Et2O also afforded 6. Complexes 4a, 5, and 6 were identified by NMR spectra and elemental
analysis, and the structure of 4a was determined by X-ray
crystallography (Figure 1).a,d

Scheme 3 Reactions of Nb(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a) with Phenols (Detailed Synthetic Procedures
Are Shown in the Supporting Information)a
In contrast, the similar reaction of 3a with
1.0 equiv
2,6-tBu2C6H3OH (in n-hexane at 25 °C) afforded a
mixture of 3a and the corresponding mono phenoxide, Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(O-2,6-tBu2C6H3) (4b), even after stirring overnight (Figure S2-4, SI).a The reaction did not reach
full conversion of 3a upon heating at 70 °C overnight,
and 4b could be isolated from the mixture after purification,
including separation of 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH by extraction of 4b with n-hexane.a It turned out that monitoring
the reaction of 3a with 2.0 equiv of 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH at 70
°C (by 1H NMR spectra in C6D6) showed resonances ascribed to 4b (and those in the
phenol) solely with complete conversion of 3a, and further
reaction did not take place even after 1 week (Figures S2-5 and S2-6, SI).a Moreover, 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction of 3a with 2.0
equiv of 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH in toluene-d8 at 100
°C for 1 day also showed resonances ascribed to 4b with complete conversion of 3a (Figure S2-8).a Complex 4b was identified by NMR spectra and elemental analysis, and the structure
was determined by X-ray crystallography (Figure 1).a,d As shown in Scheme 3, the resultant complexes (4a, 4b, 5, and 6) are four-coordinate (arylimido)niobium
complexes without coordination of HN=CtBu2 (product by reaction with phenol).

In
contrast, it should be noted that the similar reaction of 3a with 1.0 equiv of C6F5OH in n-hexane afforded Nb(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)3(HN=CtBu2) (7, isolated
from the mixture), and the same reaction with 2.0 equiv
of C6F5OH also afforded 7 as the
sole isolated product from the mixture (Scheme 4, 33% isolated yield). The results clearly
suggest that the reaction of arylimido ligand in 3a with
C6F5OH took place, whereas the reaction of the
ketimide ligand in 3a cleanly took place with 2,6-iPr2C6H3OH,
2,6-tBu2C6H3OH (and 2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH shown
below). The complex 7 was identified by NMR spectra and
elemental analysis, and the structure was determined by X-ray crystallographic
analysis.a,d

Scheme 4 Reactions of Nb(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a) with C6F5OH, (CF3)3COH, and (CF3)2CHOH (Detailed Synthetic Procedures
Are Shown in the Supporting Information)a
It turned out that reactions of 3a with 1.0
equiv
of (CF3)3COH afforded the mono alkoxide, Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2[OC(CF3)3](HN=CtBu2) (8), which coordinates HN=CtBu2 to Nb trans to the arylimido ligand (Scheme 4). The fact could
strongly suggest that (CF3)3COH coordinates
to Nb through the N(arylimido)–N(ketimide)–N(ketimide)
face and the ligand exchange took place with proton transfer (not
protonation) from (CF3)3COH to the ketimide
ligand. However, it was difficult to reach complete conversion of 3a upon heating monitored by 1H NMR spectra, and
the reaction reached 50% conversion of 3a when the mixture
was heated at 40 °C overnight. In contrast, the reaction of 3a with 2.0 equiv of (CF3)2CHOH in n-hexane (at 25 °C) afforded the bis(alkoxide), Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)[OCH(CF3)2]2(HN=CtBu2) (9, Scheme 4). The complexes 8 and 9 were identified
by NMR spectra and elemental analysis, and their structures were determined
by X-ray crystallography (Figure 2).a,d It is thus clear that the reaction with the arylimido ligand
did not take place, whereas the reaction with the arylimido ligand
took place in the reaction of 3a with C6F5OH (described above). It also turned out that coordinated
HN=CtBu2 in 9 could be removed by treatment with NiBr2 (ca. 3 equiv)
in toluene; the 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture
(after filtration and removal of toluene) suggested the formation
of Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)[OCH(CF3)2]2 (10) due to disappearance
of resonances ascribed to tBu protons
(and shift of resonances in 19F NMR spectra, Figures S1-28 and S1-29, SI).a

and Nb(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)(HN=CtBu2) (11, right). Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the 50%
probability level, and H atoms are omitted for clarity. Detailed analysis
data are shown in the Supporting Information.d

To explore why reaction of 3a with C6F5OH afforded Nb(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)3(HN=CtBu2) (7) as the isolated
product, we conducted reaction of 3a with 0.50 equiv
of C6F5OH under diluted conditions (details
are shown in the SI).a Interestingly, upon careful dropwise addition of n-hexane solution containing C6F5OH under diluted
conditions at −30 °C, the reaction mixtures consisted
of Nb(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5) (11), which could be isolated from the
mixture and was identified by NMR spectra and X-ray crystallographic
analysis, and 3a was monitored by NMR spectra (Scheme 5, data shown in Figures S2-9–12, SI).a,d The results strongly suggest
that the reaction to afford 7 proceeded via formation
of 11 as the initial product, which would be formed by
coordination of C6F5OH to Nb through N(arylimido)-N(ketimide)-N(ketimide)
face in 3a (and the subsequent proton transfer from C6F5OH to the ketimide ligand). In fact, further
careful experiments of dropwise (and two- or three-step) addition
of C6F5OH afforded 11 even in the
reaction with 0.8 equiv of C6F5OH (monitored
by NMR spectra, Figures S2-13 and S2-14, SI).a Importantly, after the above experimental
procedure (careful three-step addition of C6F5OH under highly diluted conditions), further addition of 1.0 equiv
of C6F5OH afforded Nb(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)3(HN=CtBu2) (7) as the major observed product on NMR spectra (Scheme 5, Figures S2-15 and S2-16, SI).a Although
the equivalence of C6F5OH was uncertain, the
results could suggest that 7 was formed from the mono
phenoxide (11) by reaction with the arylimido ligand.

1.946(8)–1.957(3) Å] are close to or slightly longer than
those reported [1.937(2) and 1.939(2)] in Nb(N=CtBu2)4,50 and the Nb–N–C bond angles [173.4(3)–178.9(3)°]
are close to those reported in Nb(N=CtBu2)4 [176.5(2)°].50

by X-ray crystallographic analysis,d and the
selected bond distances and angles are summarized in Table 1. These complexes fold a distorted
trigonal bipyramidal structure around niobium consisting of N(arylimido)–Nb–N(in
HN=CtBu2) axis [N(1)–Nb–N(4) (for 8 and 11) or N(1)–Nb–N(3) (for 9) bond
angles: 174.27(6), 165.90(13), and 170.26(6)°, respectively]
and a N–N(O)–O plane from alkoxide (or OC6F5) and N=CtBu2 ligand [sum of N(2)–Nb–N(3) or N(2)–Nb–O(2),

350.95° (8), 353.09° (9), 353.0°
(11)].

The Nb–N(arylimido) bond distances
in complexes 8, 9, and 11 [1.7877(15)–1.796(3)
Å] are longer than those in 1a and 1d [1.7643(15) and 1.7730(8) Å, respectively],b but close to those in 4a and 4b [1.783(3) and 1.790(9) Å, respectively]. The Nb–N(1)–C(phenyl)
bond angles in 8 and 9 [177.56(13) and 177.89(14)°,
respectively] are larger than those in 11 [170.1(3)°]
and 4a and 4b [174.5(2) and 170.1(7)°,
respectively] and are relatively close to those in 1a and 1d [176.53(12) and 175.806(3)°, respectively].b The Nb–N bond distances in the ketimide (N=CtBu2) ligand [1.9399(16)–1.9670(17)
Å] in 8, 9, and 11 are
within the range of 4a and 4b [1.946(8)–1.957(3)
Å], but apparently shorter than the Nb–N(H)=CtBu2 bond distances [2.440(2)–2.5448(17)
Å];d the Nb–N(4)–C or Nb–N(3)–C
bond angles in Nb–(H)N=CtBu2 [157.30(12)–160.7(3)°] are apparently
small compared to the Nb–N(2)–C bond angle in the ketimide
ligand [174.01(12)–178.8(3)°]. The Nb–O bond distances
in 8, 9, and 11 [1.9879(14)–2.066(3)
Å] are longer than those in 1a and 1d [1.8878(12) and 1.9231(9) Å, respectively],b4a and 4b [1.939(3) and 1.965(7)
Å, respectively], and NbCl2[(O-2,4-Me2C6H2-6-CH2)3N]
[1.8838(19)–1.925(2) Å],59 but
close to those in CpNbCl[(O-C6H4-6-CH2)3N] [1.970(5)–2.009(6) Å].61

As shown in Figure 3, ORTEP drawing for Nb(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)3(HN=CtBu2) (7), the complex
folds a distorted octahedral geometry around niobium, and both OC6F5 ligands and two of ketimide (N=CtBu2) ligands are positioned trans
[172.10(14), 168.32(12)°]. These four ligands fold a plane [sum
of O(1)–Nb–N(2), N(2)–Nb–O(3), O(3)–Nb–N(3),
and O(1)–Nb–N(3): total 360.97°] against the O(in
OC6F5)–Nb–N(in HN=CtBu2) axis [O(2)–Nb–N(1):
178.35(14)°]. The Nb–O bond distances [1.950(3)–1.976(3)
Å] are within the range of those introduced above, and the Nb–N
bond distances in the ketimide ligands [1.965(3) and 2.098(4) Å]
are shorter than the Nb–(H)N=CtBu2 bond distance [2.234(4) Å], clearly suggesting
a difference of nature of anionic donor or neutral donor ligand.

Exploration for Reaction
Mechanisms of Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a) and Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) (4a) with Phenols
As
described above, the reaction of Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a) with 1.0 or 2.0
equiv of 2,6-iPr2C6H3OH in n-hexane afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) (4a) or Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3)2 (5), respectively, as the
sole isolated product, whereas similar reactions with 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH (2.0 equiv)
afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(O-2,6-tBu2C6H3) (4b, Scheme 6) upon heating. On the basis of reactions
of 3a with fluorinated alcohols (and C6F5OH under dilute conditions), these reactions would proceed
via coordination of phenol (or alcohol) to Nb through the N(arylimido)–N(ketimide)–N(ketimide)
face in 3a and the subsequent proton transfer from the
phenol (or alcohol) to the ketimide (N=CtBu2) ligand, without accompanying protonolysis of
the N=CtBu2 group with
the alcohols (phenols). Although, as described in Introduction, this is the similar hypothesis confirmed in
the reactions of V(NAr)Me(N=CtBu2)2 with phenols affording another methyl complex54 and the reaction of V(CHSiMe3)(NAd)(CH2SiMe3)(PMe3)2 with phenol;57 however, the reaction chemistry in the niobium
complexes have never been reported. We thus conducted reaction of 4a with a different phenol (2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH) to get some information concerning the mechanism.

Scheme 6 Reactions of Nb(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a) with 2.0 equiv of Phenols (Detailed Synthetic Procedures Are Shown
in the Supporting Information)a
It turned out that
the reaction of 3a with 2.0 equiv
of 2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH in n-hexane afforded the corresponding bis(phenoxide) with coordination
of HN=CtBu2, Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,4,6-Me3C6H2)2(HN=CtBu2) (12, Scheme 6), identified by NMR spectra and elemental
analysis.a As observed in 9, treatment
of the complex 12 with NiBr2 (ca. 3 equiv)
in toluene (at 25 °C for 3 days) would afford Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,4,6-Me3C6H2)2 (13) due to disappearance
of resonances ascribed to methyl protons in the 1H NMR
spectrum of the reaction mixture (after filtration and removal of
toluene, Figure S1-32, SI).a

We note that the reaction mixture of 4a with 1.0 equiv
of 2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH in n-hexane (after 2 h) afforded a 1:1 mixture of 5 and 12 (and residual 4a) without the formation of
Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3)(O-2,4,6-Me3C6H2) (Scheme 7 and Figure 4); the reaction seemed complete and further stirring
did not improve the conversion of 4a even after 1 day
(1H NMR spectra are shown in Figures S2-17–19, SI). The fact clearly indicates not only that
certain disproportionation (phenoxy exchange reactions) proceeded
in situ, but also that the reaction should proceed via fast coordination
(shown in bracket in Scheme 7), proton transfer, and dissociation of phenols. We do not
have a clear explanation of why the reaction only afforded the disproportionation
products (5 and 12) at this moment.

Concluding Remarks
We have prepared a series of four-, five-, and six-coordinate (arylimido)niobium(V)
complexes containing ketimide (N=CtBu2), phenoxide, or fluorinated alkoxide ligands. Unique
reactivities of the tris(ketimide) analogue, Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a), with various phenols (2,6-iPr2C6H3OH, 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH, 2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH, and C6F5OH), (CF3)2CHOH, and (CF3)3COH have
been demonstrated as summarized below.

Reactions of Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)3 (3a) with 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 equiv
of 2,6-iPr2C6H3OH afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3), Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3)2, or Nb(NAr)(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3)3, respectively (in n-hexane at 25 °C),
whereas a similar reaction with 1.0 equiv of 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH afforded a mixture
of 3a and Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(O-2,6-tBu2C6H3) (4b) (even after
overnight) and the reaction with 2.0 equiv of 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH at 70 °C in
C6D6 (or 100 °C in toluene-d8) afforded 4b without the formation of the
bis(phenoxide); the reaction with 2.0 equiv of 2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,4,6-Me3C6H3)2(HN=CtBu2) with coordination of HN=CtBu2. Similar reactions of 3a with 1.0 equiv of (CF3)3COH or 2.0 equiv of
(CF3)2CHOH afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2[OC(CF3)3](HN=CtBu2)
or Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)[OCH(CF3)2]2(HN=CtBu2), respectively. In addition to the structural
analyses data, it was assumed that these reactions proceeded via coordination
of phenol (alcohol) to Nb and the subsequent proton transfer to the
ketimide ligand.

In contrast, the reaction of 3a with 1.0 or 2.0 equiv
of C6F5OH afforded Nb(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)3(HN=CtBu2) (7) as the sole isolated product (with reaction of
the arylimido ligand). It turned out that the careful dropwise addition
of C6F5OH to 3a under diluted conditions
afforded Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(OC6F5)(HN=CtBu2) (by reaction of 3a with
the ketimide) and subsequent treatment with C6F5OH afforded 7.

The reaction of Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) with 1.0
equiv of 2,4,6-Me3C6H2OH afforded
the disproportionation
products Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3)2 and Nb(NAr)(N=CtBu2)(O-2,4,6-Me3C6H2)2(HN=CtBu2) with 1:1 ratio, clearly indicating that the reaction proceeded
via coordination of phenol to Nb and the subsequent fast proton transfer
(between ketimide and phenoxide), not by protonation.

As described
in Introduction, the synthesis
and reaction chemistry of (arylimido)niobium(V) complexes containing
monodentate anionic donor ligands were less compared to those in vanadium
complexes and (tert-butylimido)niobium complexes
containing β-diketiminate ligand. Therefore, the results introduced
here should provide important information in the reaction chemistry
of niobium for better understanding. We are now exploring another
route for the synthesis of the four-coordinate (arylimido)niobium(V)
dichloride or dialkyl complexes as promising catalyst precursors for
olefin polymerization and promising precursors for the alkylidene
complexes for olefin metathesis.

All experiments were carried out
under nitrogen atmosphere in a vacuum atmosphere dry box unless otherwise
specified. All chemicals used were of reagent grade and were purified
by the standard purification procedures. Anhydrous-grade n-hexane, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, and toluene (Kanto Chemical
Co., Inc.) were transferred into bottles containing molecular sieves
(mixture of 3 Å 1/16 and 4 Å 1/8, and 13× 1/16) under
a nitrogen stream in the dry box and used without further purification.
Nb(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl3(dme),40 Nb(N-2,6-iPr2C6H3)Cl3(dme),33 and Nb(NAd)Cl3(dme)33 (Ad = 1-adamantyl) were
prepared according to a published procedure.33,40 Ethylene for polymerization was of polymerization grade (purity
>99.9%, Sumitomo Seika Co., Ltd.) and was used as received. Elemental
analyses were performed using EAI CE-440 CHN/O/S Elemental Analyzer
(Exeter Analytical, Inc.). All 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV500 spectrometer (500.13 MHz for 1H NMR, 125.77 MHz for 13C NMR). All spectra were
obtained in the solvent indicated at 25 °C unless otherwise noted.
Chemical shifts are given in parts per million and are referenced
to SiMe4 (δ 0.00 ppm, 1H NMR, 13C NMR) and CFCl3 (δ 0.00, 19F NMR). Coupling

(s, 6H, ArCH3), 1.13 (s, 18H, C(CH3)3). Dissociation of HN=CtBu2 could be observed by 1H NMR spectrum.

Crystallographic Analysis
All measurements were made
on a Rigaku XtaLAB P200 diffractometer using multilayer mirror monochromated
Mo Kα radiation. The crystal collection parameters are listed
in Table S1. The data were collected and
processed using CrystalClear (Rigaku)62 or CrysAlisPro (Rigaku Oxford Diffraction),63 and the structure was solved by direct methods64 and expanded using Fourier techniques. The nonhydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically, and the hydrogen atoms were refined
using the riding model. All calculations were performed using the
Crystal Structure65 crystallographic software
package, except for refinement, which was performed using SHELXL version
2014/7.66,67 Crystal data and the collection parameters
are shown in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting
Information, and structure reports and CIF and xyz files are also shown in the Supporting Information. CCDC numbers for complexes 1a, 1d, 4a, 4b, 7, 8, 9, and 11 are
1839646–1839653, respectively.
