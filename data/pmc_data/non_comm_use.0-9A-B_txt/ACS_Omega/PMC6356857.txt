Isotopic
variants of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) have previously been used
as a method of multiplexed detection for Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy
(SERS), including protein detection and quantification. Challenges
exist, however, with producing long-term stable SERS signals with
exposure to silver or gold metal surfaces without the use of additional
protective coatings of nanomaterials. Here, novel rhodamine “dimers”
and “trimers” have been created that demonstrate a higher
avidity for metal nanoparticles and induce aggregation to create plasmonic
“hotspots” as indicated by enhanced Raman scattering in situ. These aggregates can be formed in a colloid, on
surfaces, or membrane substrates such as poly(vinylidene fluoride)
for applications in biosciences. The integrity of the materials and
Raman signals are maintained for months of time on different substrates.
These dye materials should provide avenues for simplified in situ generation of sensors for Raman-based assays especially
in settings requiring highly robust performance.

Introduction
Rhodamine 6G (R6G)
has been widely utilized as a fluorescent probe1,2 and
laser dye3,4 due to its outstanding optical
properties (i.e., large molar extinction coefficient and fluorescence
quantum yield). In previous work, isotopic variants of R6G derivatives
have been synthesized and applied for quantitative Surface Enhanced
Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)5−7 and SERS-based protein detection.8,9 The distinct Raman signals of D0-R6G and D4-R6G (Figure 1A) at 610 and 600 cm–1, respectively, provide the basis for the accurate quantification
of protein concentration, and this isotopologue strategy of substituting
hydrogens for deuterium atoms on R6G has been employed for single
molecule detection.10 Standardization methods
using isotope dilution for enhanced Raman have been demonstrated for
samples of biological fluids.11,12

The application of SERS in quantitative bioassays motivates
approaches
to improve reproducibility and the robustness of molecular assemblies.
The development of new bioassays suitable for clinical or point-of-care
applications are especially timely. An established approach has been
the use of core–shell nanomaterials, as individual reporters
often termed nanotags or nanoprobes.13 Complementary
approaches to arrive at substrates with stable arrays of SERS active
gold or silver nanostructures continue to emerge. Several examples
include metal functionalized “nanopillars” anchored
on silicon wafers,14 paper dipsticks, and
cotton swabs integrated with branched nanoantennas,15 printed gold nanoparticles on plastic substrates,16 cross-linked Au/Ag nanoparticles in mesoporous
aerogels,17 gold-plated nanoporous membranes,18 and gold nanoparticles stabilized in filter
paper.19 All of these approaches add complexity
to either preparation of substrates or nanomaterials, substrates,
or both. The robustness and costs of these methods for translation
to commercial products remain to be realized.

An alternative
approach is the in situ generation
of nanoparticle assemblies capable of enhancing specific Raman signals
at the point of analyte detection. A few recent examples have enabled
biochemical measurement in complex matrices.20−22 However, the
broad extendibility of these reported methods is not known at this
time. Although dyes like R6G produce reliable Raman signals in silver
colloid, the signal stability limits practical applications due to
chemical instability of the dye–metal aggregates. Silver and
gold nanoparticle aggregation can be induced through the addition
of heat or salts to colloidal suspensions,23−26 but certain assay formats on
different matrices may not be able to take advantage of this effect.
To advance the in situ assembly of silver nanoparticle
hotspots, the chemical features of dye molecules that promote interactions
with silver and gold were employed to increase avidity for the metal
surface by linking the dye units.

Results and Discussion
The basic strategy involves the covalent linkage of rhodamine molecules
based upon previous work for substitution of the 2′-carboxylic
acid functional group.9 The symmetrical
dimer molecules were synthesized through the linker N,N-dimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine (Schemes S1 and S2). The coupling reaction was achieved with high yield (80–90%)
using O-(1H-6-chlorobenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HCTU) to form tertiary amides. Similarly, a rhodamine
“trimer” was created using a trivalent, symmetric linker
(Figure 1C and Scheme S3). Optical absorptivity of these compounds
correlated with the number of dye fragments with the D0 dimer and
trimer having measured molar extinction coefficients at 532 nm of
296 000 and 376 000 M–1 cm–1, respectively, which are both higher than that of R6G (116 000
M–1 cm–1).

The major Raman
features of all the rhodamine variants are expected
to be similar. However, the chemical properties of the dimer and trimer
compounds should be distinct with respect to their associations with
metal nanoparticles. Isotopomeric variants of the dimer molecule were
also prepared using the relevant isotopic substitution in R6G free
acid based upon previous methods (Scheme S2).7,27 Four isotopically labeled variants of the
dye dimers were synthesized—D0, D4, D8, and D12—that
are analogous to the substitution patterns of the R6G isotopomers
in Figure 1A. Enhanced
Raman spectra were obtained using two different substrates: gold-coated
glass and PVDF.

The Raman transitions of each of the dimers
were compared to R6G
and the trimer. Raman shifts at 532, 633, and 785 nm (Figures S1–S3, respectively) indicate similar spectral
features for the nondeuterium labeled R6G, D0 dimer and trimer. As
expected from the previous work using R6G isotopologues the D4, D8,
and D12 dimers showed distinct shifts in the 600 and/or 1350 nm range.10 Principal component analyses of the spectra
also statistically validate these observations (Figures S4). The resulting spectra were of comparable intensity
and shifts on the glass slides and PVDF membranes (Figure S5).

The exposure of the silver nanopoarticles
(SNPs) to the dimer or
trimer resulted in visible aggregation at dye concentrations greater
than 2.5 μM or 625 nM, respectively (Figure
S6). R6G did not cause observable aggregation even at greater
than 10-fold higher concentrations. The same effect was observed when
using 20 or 100 nm silver nanoparticles or 50 nm gold nanoparticles
(data not shown). Additionally, visible aggregation (noted by dark
coloration and opaqueness) was observed even when dimer or trimer
dyes were dried on either glass slides or PVDF before exposure to SNPs on the surface. These characteristics were not
observed with R6G under any of the conditions tested. Furthermore,
when the D0 dimer and R6G were added to SNPs at the same concentration
(10 μM), the enhanced Raman for the dimer showed more than 10-fold
greater signal-to-noise ratio relative to R6G (Figure 2A). When the concentration of R6G is taken
to much higher concentrations (>100 μM), there begin to be
some
visible signs of aggregation, but not with the sharp transition observed
with the dimer and no increases in Raman signals. Additionally, extending
the period of exposure of the dyes to the nanoparticles to greater
than 1 h had no noticeable effect on the resulting levels of aggregation
and Raman signal.

Figure 2 Enhanced Raman signals of dye dimers. (A) Raman spectra
for equimolar
(10 μM) amounts of R6G (black line) or the D0 dimer (red line)
exposed to SNPs showing differential enhancement of the Raman signals.
The calculated signal-to-noise for the monomer and dimer is 10.8 and
128.3, respectively. (B) Mixtures of the D8 dimer and R6G were combined
in varied ratios at 10 μM total dye concentrations, exposed
to SNPs, and spotted on gold-covered glass slides. At 10-fold molar
excess of R6G to D8 dimer, the peaks at 600 and 615 cm–1, representing the dimer or R6G, respectively, have approximately
equal areas under the curves; at equimolar proportions, the D8 dimer
signal is more than 10-fold than that for R6G.

A competition experiment was executed by mixing R6G and D8
dimer
to assess if there are observed differences in the association with
hotspots as detected by enhanced Raman scattering. Aqueous solutions
of D8 dimer and R6G were mixed in various proportions from 1:20 to
5:1, respectively, before exposure to constant amounts of SNPs (Figure 2B). At equivalent
molar concentrations, the dimer signal (603 cm–1) was 10-fold greater in intensity than that of R6G (615 cm–1), based on signal-to-noise ratios of 238.9 and 24.6, respectively.
The 603 and 615 cm–1 peaks had the closest to equal
signals when R6G was 10-fold higher in concentration than the D8 dimer.
These observations are consistent with the distinctive greater intensity
SER(R)S for the D0 dimer.

Since aggregation of SNPs has been
associated with longer-term
stability,23 a comparison of 10 μM
samples of R6G and D0 dimer with colloidal SNPs were spotted on PVDF
membrane and a gold-coated glass slide. The enhanced Raman signals
were measured at 532 nm using identical conditions for both samples
on each matrix at 4 h and 90 d after depositing on the surfaces, with
the dried PVDF membrane stored at room temperature, without specific
protection from light. After the period of storage, the Raman spectra
of the dimer had not significantly changed on either PVDF or glass
(Figure 3A,B), while
the signal of R6G had nearly completely been lost (Figure 3C). As confirmation that this
observation was not dependent on visible aggregation (see Figure S6), a 313 nM colloidal sample of D0 dimer—well
below the level of visible aggregation—was spotted on PVDF.
In accordance with the previous observation of D0 dimer, after 90
d at room temperature, the Raman signal was not diminished (Figure S7).

Figure 3 Stability of Raman signal over time. (A)
Spectra of the D0 dimer
were obtained on PVDF (A; green line) or a gold-covered glass slide
(B; black line) at 532 or 785 nm, respectively. The two samples were
assessed after 90 d at ambient temperature without protection from
light using identical measurement conditions (green dotted line in
A; red dotted line in B). Samples were prepared by mixing 10 μM
D0 dimer with SNPs in water. Removal of the signal backgrounds (right
panels in A and B) reveals that there was not substantial change in
peak shape or intensities of the Raman signals even after 90 d of
exposure. (C) When compared to the monomer, the D0 dimer (left panel)
maintained a stable signal over time, while the R6G signal (right
panel) is nearly completely absent.

In accordance with previous studies that have utilized isotopically
labeled variants of fluorescent dyes,5−7 deuterium-labeled dimers
should have distinct spectral shifts. To demonstrate these features,
the D0 and D8 dimers were combined in increasing ratiometric mixtures
in water before deposition onto gold-coated glass (Figure 4). The results show that the
two isotopic variants of the dye dimer have unique spectral characteristics
that can be exploited, as has been done in previous studies with Raman-active
dyes, to enable relative quantification of one dye compared to the
other.

Figure 4 Feasibility of using dimers for quantification. The D0 and D8 dimers
were combined in ratiometric mixtures in water, were exposed to SNPs,
and were then deposited on gold-coated glass. Consistent with prior
studies involving isotopically labeled variant dyes, deuterium-labeled
dimers have distinct Raman shifts, compared to the nondeuterated variant.

The unique properties of the dyes
described here could find application
in bioassays. To enable general protein labeling by these compounds,
variants of the D0 and D8 dimers were synthesized with a trivalent,
symmetrical linker that contains an NHS ester functional group (Figure 5A and Scheme S4).9 Generic
goat antimouse IgG was labeled with the modified dimers. The extent
of labeling was determined by the ratio of absorbances at 280 and
532 nm. A feasibility test for the detection of the IgG involved deposition
onto low-fluorescence PVDF membrane, which is a generally useful protein
binding substrate. The entire membrane was then exposed to PROTOGOLD
gold staining solution (Ted Pella, Inc.), which was followed by exposure
to LI silver solutions (Nanoprobes, Inc.), which generates Ag0 in situ. The deposited dye-labeled IgG could then be observed
using chemical imaging with a Raman microscope down to sub-picogram
levels (Figure 5B).
Taken together with the fact that mixtures of isotopically labeled
dyes can be used for purposes of quantification, the dye dimer-labeled
IgG offers utility for common workflows involving antibody-based detection
of bioanalytes on membranes. The assays could be performed with basic
metal “staining” reagents, circumventing the need to
formulate more sophisticated materials, such as coated nanoparticles.

Figure 5 Dye-labeled
IgG can be detected at low levels using basic staining
procedures. (A) Variants of the D0 and D8 dimers were synthesized
containing a trivalent linker containing an NHS ester functional group.
This enables covalent attachment to protein lysine groups. (*) The
locations of deuterium substitution for the D8 dimer. (B) When generic
IgG antibody is labeled with the dye dimer(s), and spotted on
PVDF, it can be easily detected with Raman to sub-picogram levels
using basic Au/Ag staining conditions (see Experimental
Section for details).

To further demonstrate the feasibility of such an assay,
solutions
of human-derived serum albumin ranging from 2 nM to 2 pM were created
in varying concentrations with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH
7.4). Strips (0.5 × 3 cm) were cut from low-fluorescence PVDF
membrane and submerged into the solutions containing different
concentrations of human serum albumin. The protein was probed by
exposing the strips to mouse antihuman serum albumin monoclonal IgG,
followed by exposure to secondary antibody composed of D0 dimer-labeled
goat antimouse IgG. The PVDF strips were then treated with PROTOGOLD
gold stain and LI silver stain, before analysis by Raman spectroscopy
at 532 nm. From the results, albumin present at a concentration of
2 pM in PBS could be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of
4.4, based on the peak at 615 cm–1; however, these
data are not shown, because the large amount of background signal
(at that low level of detection) would make it impractical to try
to integrate any peaks from the curve. The overall signal intensity
and S/N increased in accordance with increased concentrations of serum
albumin, with respective S/N ratios of 10.1, 23.4, and 31.4 (Figure 6). While this demonstration
is not a complete or optimized analytical method, it does establish
the feasibility of a simple “dipstick”-based assay for
specific proteins adsorbed onto surfaces. Also note that, at points
during the course of experimentation, nanoparticles were exposed to
solutions of dyes in either ultrapure water or PBS at pH 7.4, and
no effect on the resulting Raman signals’ intensities or stabilities
(following exposure to dyes) was observed (data not shown). More acidic
or basic solutions have not been tested, but along with more extensive
mechanism studies of the aggregates will be an interesting subject
for future investigations.

Figure 6 Dye-labeled IgG can be used as a probe to detect
dilute protein
in solution. Strips of PVDF were submerged in solutions of varying
concentrations of human serum albumin in PBS buffer. Albumin was then
probed for using mouse antihuman albumin, followed by D0 dimer-labeled
goat antimouse IgG. The PVDF strips were exposed to PROTOGOLD and
LI silver stain solutions, and analyzed by Raman spectroscopy at 532
nm. The resulting spectra were baseline corrected and vector normalized
to equivalent scales using OPUS 7.5 software.

The combination of high Raman scattering dyes with isotopic
labeling
provides avenues for accurate and quantitative SERS. By leveraging
increases in dye avidity for gold and silver nanoparticles exhibited
by dimer and trimer rhodamine dyes, the direct applications in surface-enhanced
Raman-based assays are enabled. The greater simplicity of the materials
and processes and long-term stability of dye–metal aggregates
offer a robust approach for in situ generation of
chemical sensors suitable for field-use and/or point-of-care on low-cost
substrates. By synthetic modification, these dyes can be covalently
incorporated by bioconjugation or other reactive surfaces typically
used for bioanalytical methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and microarrays. Along with prior
efforts,8,9 this study establishes isotopically labeled
dye dimer bioconjugation reagents for quantitative protein detection
using in situ generation of SERS active sensors.
The extension of these dimeric dyes through chemical modification
are anticipated to improve on the utility of SERS for applications
such as robust, quantitative immunological assays.28

Sampling and Analysis of
Raman Spectra
Raman spectra
were obtained using a SENTERRA I Raman microscope (Bruker Optics,
Inc.), with a 20× objective, 532 nm laser source, 5 mW laser
power, 0.5 s integration time, and three coadditions. Spectral data
were processed and analyzed using OPUS 7.5 software (Bruker Optics,
Inc.). Graphs depicting Raman spectra were generated using OriginPro
2015 software.

General Procedure for Depositing of Dye-Coated
Nanoparticles
on Glass or PVDF Substrates
Five microliters (1 mg/mL) of
50 nm diameter silver citrate-capped nanoparticles (nanoComposix,
Inc.) were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with ultrapure water
three times. The pelleted SNPs were dispersed into 20 μL of
each of the respective dyes at equal concentrations (10 μM)
in ultrapure water for 30 s. One microliter of the colloids was spotted
onto a gold-coated microscope slide and allowed to air-dry. PVDF membranes
were used as a second test matrix using the same sampling procedure.

Labeling of IgG with Raman-Active Dyes
One hundred microliters
of goat antimouse IgG (2.12 mg/mL; Abcam, Plc.) was transferred to
an Amicron Ultra 0.5 mL spin tube (MilliporeSigma), followed by 300
μL of 50 mM NaHCO3 (pH 9.0). The tube was centrifuged
at 13 000g for 10 min, and 400 μL of
additional 50 mM NaHCO3 (pH 9.0) was added. The tube was
centrifuged  and 50 μL aliquots of the supernatant
were pipetted into two separate 500 μL Eppendorf tubes. Ten
equivalents of either D0 or D8 NHS ester dimer (2 μM in 50 mM
NaHCO3 (pH 9.0)) were added, and the solution was incubated
at room temperature for 1 h, after mixing. The solutions were then
transferred into two Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL spin tubes, followed by the
addition of 300 μL of PBS at pH 7.4 with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST),
and centrifuged at 13 000g for 7 min.
Four hundred microliters of additional PBST buffer was added, and
the tubes were again centrifuged for 7 min; this step was repeated
twice more, until the flow-through was colorless. The solutions were
then transferred to 500 μL Eppendorf tubes and diluted to a
final volume of 100 μL using PBST. Concentrations of IgG were
assessed via BCA.

Generating Raman Spectra of Dye-Labeled IgG
Raman spectra
of dye dimer-labeled IgG were obtained using low-fluorescence, 0.45
μm pore size PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Solutions
of dye-labeled IgGs were first prepared in ultrapure water; 2 μL
of the samples were deposited on PVDF presoaked with methanol, and
the membrane was allowed to air-dry for 20 min in the dark. At that
time, the membrane was exposed to PROTOGOLD gold stain solution (Ted
Pella, Inc.) for 3.5 h at room temperature in the dark. The membrane
was then washed with ultrapure water and exposed to a mixture of equal
volumes of LI silver solutions A and B (Nanoprobes, Inc.) for 15 min
in the dark. At that time, the membrane was washed with ultrapure
water and allowed to air-dry overnight at room temperature in the
dark, prior to Raman analysis.

Detection of Serum Albumin
Using Dye-Labeled IgG
Solutions
of human serum albumin were prepared in PBS buffer at concentrations
from 2 nM to 2 pM. Separately, 0.5 × 3 cm strips were cut from
bulk low-fluorescence PVDF membrane. The strips were submerged in
the different albumin solutions and then agitated at room temperature
for 30 min; they were then removed from the albumin solutions, and
excess liquid was blotted away. Following subsequent washing of the
PVDF membrane with PBST buffer, and incubation of the strips in blocking
buffer (3% BSA in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature, the strips were
exposed to monoclonal mouse antihuman serum albumin IgG (2.0 mg/mL;
Abcam, Plc.) in blocking buffer, washed with PBST, and then exposed
to D0 dimer-labeled goat antimouse IgG in blocking buffer. The strips
were washed with PBST and ultrapure water and then were allowed to
dry at room temperature in the dark. The strips were then exposed
to PROTOGOLD gold staining solution for 2.5 h at room temperature
in the dark, followed by exposure to LI silver stain solution at room
temperature for 10 min in the dark, washed with ultrapure water, and
dried.
