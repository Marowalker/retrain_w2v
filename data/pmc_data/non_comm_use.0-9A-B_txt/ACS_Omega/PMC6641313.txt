The (111) surface
of γ-alumina has been reexamined, and a
new (111) surface model has been suggested. The local structure of
this new surface of γ-alumina, (111)n, has been optimized
by the density functionals along with the full electron basis sets
by using periodic boundary condition. This newly modeled (111)n surface is characterized by the same stability as that of
the (110) surface, and its surface energy amounts to 2.561 J/m2, only about 0.002 J/m2 larger than that of (110).
Three different types of the tricoordinated Al centers have been identified
on (111)n. Molecular orbital (MO) analysis and the population
analysis demonstrate that one type of Al, Al(I), is a nonpaired electron
center. The singly occupied MO on Al(I) center is expected to play
an important role in the catalytic activities of the γ-alumina.
Moreover, the neighboring Al (Al(III)) on the (111)n surface
provides suitable acceptance position for the electron donating groups.
The defected surfaces of (111)n are found to be having
a similar stability. The detachment of Al(I) from the (111)n surface results in disappearance of the nonpaired electron centers.
Meanwhile, the attachment of Al(I) on (111)n surface will
produce rich nonpaired electron centers on this new surface. Therefore,
this newly defined surface is expected to attract the research interests
in the catalytic activities of γ-alumina.

==== Body
Introduction
One of the important
forms of alumina phases determined by experimental
investigations on deposited Al/Al2O3 multilayers
is the so-called γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3).1 Although this form of alumina phase
is widely used in industry, its accurate structure is still controversial.
Understanding its structure and the corresponding properties inspires
a large number of experimental and theoretical studies.2−7 In general, the γ-Al2O3 can be characterized
as a defective spinel structure in which the Al vacancy sites are
distributed within the lattice.3,5 However, the structure
and the physicochemical properties of the surfaces of γ-Al2O3 are less understood. Experimental and theoretical
modeling on a low-index surface suggest the presence of pentacoordinated
Al sites at the surface that might play a key role in the physicochemical
properties of γ-Al2O3 surfaces.5,8 However, other studies indicated that the surface with tricoordinated
centers is particularly important in the formation of active centers
of dissociation of C–H bond in methane.2−4,9−14 Recent studies of the activation of methane on the γ-Al2O3 surfaces suggest that the highly reactive acid–base
pairs created at the tricoordinated Al (AlIII) enable low-energy
pathways for the heterolytic splitting of C–H bond of methane.2,14

The precise structure of γ-alumina is still undetermined
though it has been modeled by different groups using theoretical approaches.3−5,15,16 Amongst these models, the model constructed by Digne et al. has
been widely accepted for the investigations of the crystal facets in γ-alumina.2−4,6,7,15 On the basis
of this model, most studies have been focused on the (100) and (110)
surfaces. It is important to note that the highly reactive acid–base
pair center, AlIII, exists only on the surface (110). On
the other hand, the (111) surface of the γ-alumina has been
reported to be much less stable and less important due to its high
surface energy (as compared to that of (100) and (110) surfaces).3,4

On examining Digne’s model of the γ-alumina,
we noticed
that there could exist a different form of (111) surface of the γ-alumina.
Here, we report the local structure and the energy properties of this
altered surface of γ-alumina (see Figure 2 below, denoted as (111)n to differentiate
the (111) surface model proposed by Digne et al.3,4).
Our studies demonstrate that this (111)n surface has lower
surface energy as compared to that of (110). Moreover, this new surface
includes more tricoordinated Al centers, as compared to that of (110).
Therefore, this newly reported findings should attract the research
interests, especially from a community interested in the catalytic
activities of γ-alumina.

Methods and Model
Selection of the (111)n Surface
The unit
cell of the γ-alumina bulk was constructed according to the
well-documented crystallographic data by Digne et al. (Figure 1).3,4 Although
this model cannot reproduce the intricacy of the γ-alumina entirely,3 it provides a good compromise between the structure
reliability and the sizes compatible with quantum chemical calculations.
On examination of the (111) surface of the γ-alumina proposed
in ref (3) (see Scheme 1 for the corresponding
surface selections of the γ-alumina and Figure 2, the light blue framed area that depicts (111) surface),
we noticed that there is a similar surface that should be more stable.
This is because less Al–O bond breaking is needed to form it
(the black line indicated in Figure 2). The surface density of broken Al–O bonds
is as low as 12.2 bonds/nm2. As comparison, the surface
density of broken Al–O bonds is 27.0 bonds/nm2 for
the surface (111) and 20.7 bonds/nm2 for the surface (110).3 However, one should realize that surface energy
does not depend entirely on the number of broken Al–O bonds.
The bond energy also depends on the types of the Al–O bond.
On the basis of this new (111)n surface, a hexagonal lattice
form of γ-Al2O3 unit cell was constructed,
as shown in Figure 3. The construction of this new hexagonal lattice form does not alter
the model of the γ-alumina. However, it provides an easy way
to examine the (111)n surface because in the hexagonal
lattice form, (111)n is on the surface of the cell unit,
as can be seen from Figure 3. Similar to the rectangular form of the unit cell, this hexagonal
form of cell also contains 40 atoms and 400 electrons. To ensure that
there is sufficient bulk environment underneath the investigated surface,
a supercell model consisting of two units along the (111)n surface direction has been adapted (see Figure 4). Thus, a model of the supercell system
that contains 80 atoms and 800 electrons has been used in the present
computational study.

Method of Computations
The calculations are based on
density functional theory (DFT). The spin-polarized density functional
and the generalized gradient approximation by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof
(PBEPBE)17,18 and the newly developed functional by Peverati
and Truhlar (M11-L and MN12-L)19 have been
used in the calculations. Instead of using the plane wave basis, such
as in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),20−22 the localized
basis set, the standard valence double ζ basis set, 6-31G,23,24 was applied. Also, the smaller basis set 3-21G25 was tested for comparison. Periodic boundary conditions
were applied for the description of the bulk phase. The total k-point number amounts to 76 for the two-unit cell system,
and the corresponding repeated cell number reaches 1829 in the calculations
for the bulk phase. For the computations of the surfaces, two-dimensional
periodic boundary conditions were applied for the model systems. The
total k-point number amounts to 52 in the surface
phase studies. During the computations of the bulk phase, both atoms
and the cell parameters were fully optimized. One should note that
using a two-dimensional periodic boundary condition implies infinite
vacuum above the studied surface. Therefore, the possible long-range
interactions between the surfaces are not taken into consideration
in this method. For the study of the surface, the positions of all
of the atoms were fully optimized while the corresponding lattice
vectors were kept fixed. The Gaussian-09 package of programs26 was used for all computations.

Results
and Discussion
The unit cell of the rectangular form of the
model was optimized
by DFT approach using the functional PBEPBE, M11-L, and MN12-L, with
the all-electron basis set 6-31G (and also 3-21G), respectively. Table 1 summarizes the computed
bulk structural parameters. The calculations using M11-L functional
predict the most tightened cell parameters for the considered model.
The cell volume calculated at the M11-L/3-21G level of theory is 43.90
Å3 for each Al2O3, about 2.49
Å3/Al2O3 smaller than that determined
experimentally. Increasing the basis set to 6-31G improves the cell
volume estimation. The cell volume calculated at M11-L/6-31G level
amounts to 45.65 Å3/Al2O3. This
underestimates experimental data by about 0.74 Å3 for
each Al2O3. The newly developed functional MN12-L
overestimates the cell volume by 0.66 Å3 for each
Al2O3 when 6-31G basis set is used. With the
3-21G basis set, the functional PBEPBE predicts the cell volume of
46.21 Å3/Al2O3, best agreement
compared to the experimental values of 46.39 Å3/Al2O3.27 However, the PBEPBE
functional has a strong basis set dependency. The cell volume predicted
at the PBEPBE/6-31G level of theory is 49.60 Å3/Al2O3, about 3.21 Å3/Al2O3 larger than that of the experimental value. Increasing
to the triple-ζ type of basis set TZV28,29 slightly reduces the cell volume to 48.96 Å3/Al2O3, still significantly overestimating the cell
volume as compared with the experimental value. Therefore, the following
discussions will mainly be based on the results obtained using the
PBEPBE functional with 6-31G and 3-21G basis sets.

The fully optimized supercell unit in the hexagonal
form in bulk
is depicted in Figure 4. The space group is found to be P21/m for the fully optimized cell. Also, the fully optimized
(111)n surface model is given for comparison. As mentioned
above, two slabs of the unit have been adapted to ensure inclusion
of sufficient bulk environment underneath the considered surface.
During the optimization process of the surface (111)n,
the periodic boundary conditions were applied only for the b and c directions of the unit cell. Also,
the cell lengths of b and c in the
surface unit were kept as the same as those of the optimized unit
in bulk. The optimized structural parameters of the cell unit are
summarized in Table 2, and the corresponding coordinates of the atoms in the cells are
given in the Supporting Information. As
expected, the cell volume in the hexagonal form of the model is virtually
the same as that in its rectangular form. This indicates that the
model selection and the computation method applied are reasonable
and are suitable in the present study.

On the basis of the supercell (two-unit cell) model
(in which the
film consists of eight atomic layers, see Figure 4) the surface energy of the nonoptimized
(111)n surface is calculated to be 2.946 J/m2 at the PBEPBE/6-31G level of theory. The corresponding surface energy
is 3.091 J/m2 at the PBEPBE/6-31G//3-21G level of theory.
Optimization leads to the decrease in the surface energy by about
0.624 J/m2. The surface energy of the optimized (111)n surface amounts to 2.322 J/m2 by the PBEPBE/6-31G
method. Using the PBEPBE/6-31G//3-21G approach, this surface energy
is 2.561 J/m2. The surface energy difference resulted from
the basis-set-induced geometric variation is around 0.24 J/m2, as revealed by the PBEPBE method. This difference is smaller than
that obtained by applying different functionals. The surface energy
of (111)n surface is computed to be 3.087 J/m2 at the MN12-L/6-31G level of theory (3.781 J/m2 for the
nonoptimized surface).

For comparison, the surface energy of
the (110) surface was calculated
at the PBEPBE/6-31G//3-21G level of theory on the basis of the supercell
of the rectangular form (Figure 5). The surface energy of the nonoptimized (110) surface
is calculated to be 3.355 J/m2, about 0.264 J/m2 larger than that of (111)n surface. Furthermore, on the
basis of the optimized structures, the surface energy of (110) surface
is evaluated to be 2.559 J/m2, about 0.002 J/m2 smaller than that of (111)n surface. Therefore, the formation
of this novel (111)n surface is expected to be as feasible
as the case of (110) surface under the dehydrated conditions.

surface based on the two-unit supercell of the
rectangle form of γ-alumina. Color legends: red for O and light
pink for Al.

It is important to note
that the surface energies calculated by
using the localized basis sets (3-21G and 6-31G) are significantly
larger than those computed by using the plane wave basis (using the
VASP program).20−22 With the nonlocalized plane wave basis, the PBEPBE
method predicts that the surface energy of the (111)n surface
amounts to 1.772 J/m2, whereas that of the (110) surface
is 1.760 J/m2 at the same level of theory (supercell model,
eight atomic layers, with a vacuum thickness of 40 Å between
the periodically repeated slabs). For comparison, the relaxed surface
energy of the (110) surface is reported to be 1.540 J/m2 with PW91 functional (slab with eight atomic layers, with a vacuum
thickness of 12 Å between the periodically repeated slabs, see
ref (3)).

It
is clear that the surface energy predicted by using the localized
basis sets is significantly larger than that by using the plane wave
basis set. This surface energy difference can be attributed to the
valence electrons only description of the Al–O bonding by the
plane wave approaches. The larger surface energies predicted using
the localized basis sets suggest that Al–O bonding may be included
in the inner-shell electron configurations contribution.

The
results of band gap predictions are found to be strongly related
to the functional used. For the bulk phase, the band gap is 7.64 eV
by the MN12-L/6-31G approach, whereas it is 5.86 eV by the PBEPBE/6-31G
method. For comparison, the electron gap is 3.9–4.9 eV with
the functional PW91 by using the plane wave basis set in the VASP
calculations.3,5 For the (111)n phase,
the band gap predicted in the present study is reduced to 3.21 eV
at the MN12-L/6-31G level of theory and to 3.25 eV at the PBEPBE/6-31G
level of theory. This reduced electron gap implies existence of active
sites on the surface.

Local Structure of (111)n Surface
Only three-coordinated
Al atoms are found in this (111)n surface. One of them
comes from the six-coordinated Al (marked I in Figure 4) in bulk phase and the other two are derived
from the four-coordinated Al (marked II and III in Figure 4). The top view of the optimized
surface layer of (111)n is depicted in Figure 6, in which the atoms underneath
the surface have been deleted for clarity. Main geometric parameters
of the optimized surface layer of (111)n are summarized
in Table 3. Compared
to the bulk phase, the Al(I)–O bond lengths increases by about
0.09 Å for the oxygen atoms not connected to Al(II). The dihedral
angle O(1)–O(3)–O(2)–Al(I) on the surface (111)n is equal to 57.06°, about 2° smaller than that
in the bulk. Thus, the coordination bonding between the Al(I) and
O on this surface is weaker than that in bulk. On the other hand,
the Al–O bonding for the Al(II) and Al(III) is intensified
on the (111)n surface. The decrease in Al–O atomic
distance ranges from 0.03 to 0.05 Å, as compared to that in the
bulk. It is important to note that the coordination pattern of Al
is greatly influenced by the local structure of its surroundings.
In spite of the intensified Al–O bonding, Al(III) on the (111)n surface still adopts the tetrahedron form of the bonding
pattern. The dihedral angle of O(6)–O(7)–O(8)–Al(III)
on the surface (111)n is about 19°. However, Al(II)
on the surface virtually lies in the plane formed by the three-coordinating
O atoms. The value of dihedral angle O(3)–O(4)–O(5)–Al(II)
on the surface (111)n is about 3°. It seems that by
sharing the coordinating atom O(3), the presence of Al(I) in the neighbor
position strongly influences the bonding pattern of Al(II). This phenomenon
will be discussed again in the next section.

the optimized surface layer of (111)n. Atoms underneath
the surface have been deleted for clarity.

Molecular orbital (MO)
analysis demonstrates that one of the sp3 type of MOs of
Al(I) is singly occupied (Figure 7, highest occupied molecular
orbital, HOMO – 2 of α MO and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) of β MO). Consistent with the MO analysis, the
population analysis based on the electron density (Table 4) reveals that the spin density
of Al(I) amounts to 0.74 and that of Al(III) to 0.00. This single
occupancy of Al(I) is further confirmed by the projected density of
states (PDOS) analysis of the surface phase. The weak peak around
−0.4 eV in Figure 8 is mainly attributed to the singly occupied HOMO –
2 of α MO, whereas the weak peak at around 3.4 eV is assigned
to the corresponding LUMO of β MO. This singly occupied MO of
Al(I) is expected to play an important role in the catalytic activities
of the γ-alumina. On the other hand, the unoccupied sp3 MO of Al(III) (Figure 7) on the (111)n surface provides good acceptance location
for the electron donating groups. Figure 9 displays the PDOS of the Al and O on the
(111)n surface phase. As expected, the occupied lower energy
bands are mainly contributed by the electrons from O, indicating the
coordination bonding between the anionic O and the positively charged
Al. On the other hand, the notable contributions from O to the first
unoccupied bands suggest that the electrons of the O are more attracted
toward the Al on the surface phase, as compared with on the bulk phase.
This is consistent with the spin density analysis (Table 4) on the (111)n surface.
Also, this indicates a stronger Al–O bond on the surface phase,
agreeing with the short Al–O bond length, as revealed in the
last section.

(111)n Surface with Defects
As mentioned
above, the bonding between O and Al(I) is weakened on the (111)n surface of the γ-alumina. Therefore, Al(I) might be
detached from the (111)n surface during the surface creation.
This Al(I) detached surface of the γ-alumina will be labeled
here as (111)nd. Meanwhile, this detached Al(I) is more
likely to be retained on the other side of the surface during the
crystal splitting process (see Figure 10), forming Al(I)-attached surface (111)na. The surface energy of the nonoptimized (111)nd and (111)na surface is calculated to be 3.091 J/m2 at the PBEPBE/6-31G//3-21G level of theory. Optimization
leads to the surface energy of 2.556 J/m2. Thus, the stability
of the defected (111)n surface is nearly the same as that
of the (110) surface. The local geometric parameters of the optimized
(111)nd surface are listed in Table 5. Only Al(III) type of Al exists on this
surface (see Figure 11). The detachment of Al(I) from the (111)n surface eliminates
the planar form Al–O coordinating bonding. The dihedral angle
of O(3)–O(4)–O(5)–Al(II) on the surface (111)nd is about 25°, roughly close to that of O(6)–O(7)–O(8)–Al(III)
on the (111)n surface. Both MO analysis and the population
analysis (Table 6)
indicate that the Al atoms on this defected surface are close-shelled.
The detachment of Al(I) from the (111)n surface removes
the nonpaired electron centers. Two types of Al are found on the surface
(111)na: Al(I) and Al(II). Similar to that on the (111)n surface, one nonpaired electron locates on Al(I), as shown
by the population analysis (Table 6). As expected, the geometry of Al(I) on the surface
(111)na resembles that on (111)n surface. The
dihedral angle of O(1)–O(3)–O(2)–Al(I) on the
surface (111)na is 56.77°. Meanwhile, Al(II) on the
surface virtually lies in the plane formed by the three coordinating
O atoms. This is evidenced by the value of 4° of the dihedral
angle O(3)–O(4)–O(5)–Al(II) on the (111)n surface.

Concluding Remarks
The local structure of the newly revealed
surface of γ-alumina,
(111)n, has been optimized by density functional methods
along with the localized full electron basis sets using periodic boundary
conditions. Our studies demonstrate that the (111)n surface
has lower surface energy as compared to that of (111) and similar
surface energy as compared to that of (110). The surface energy of
the optimized (111)n surface of 2.561 J/m2 is
only 0.002 J/m2 larger than that of (110), suggesting significance
of both (110) and (111)n surfaces. This new surface includes
three different types of the tricoordinated Al centers. The results
of MO and the population analysis reveal existence of one type of
Al, Al(I), which is a nonpaired electron center. The singly occupied
MO on Al(I) might be the key component for the catalytic activities
of the γ-alumina. Moreover, the neighboring Al (Al(III)) on
the (111)n surface provides a suitable location for the
electron donating groups. Therefore, this should be vital for the
catalytic properties of γ-alumina.

The defected surfaces
of (111)n are found to have a
similar stability. The detachment of Al(I) from the (111)n surface results in disappearance of the nonpaired electron centers.
Meanwhile, the attachment of Al(I) on (111)n surface will
produce rich nonpaired electron centers on this new surface.

The study of the hydration properties and the corresponding thermal
stability is of importance for the understanding of the catalysis
procedures of the new surface. Also, the study of the adsorption properties
of suitable probe molecules (e.g., CO) that can provide information
about the Lewis acidity of the Al surface sites is of importance.
Studies of these properties are undergoing in our laboratories.
