This study aimed to novelly design
and synthesize an amide derivative
as a potential substitute of celastrol (CLT). We constituted the compound
celastrol–glucosamine (CLG) by conjugating 1-(2-aminoethoxy)-2-glucosamine
to celastrol (CLT) and confirmed its chemical structure by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and LC-MS/MS. Then, the potential efficacy
of the CLG was investigated on renal ischemia–reperfusion injury
animal models. The results demonstrated that the decorated compound
CLG could completely reverse the disease progression as same as CLT.
Furthermore, the toxicity of CLG was also fully evaluated in rat blood,
liver, kidney, heart, spleen, lung, and reproductive system. Compared
to the performance of CLT on normal organs, CLG could remarkably maintain
high safety and significantly reduce the side effects. Taken together,
the CLG could keep the same efficacy as CLT while processing lower
toxicity in vivo.

1 Introduction
Renal
disease is gradually rising around the world, which is a
severe problem. It is reported that 6.5–10% population in developing
country is suffering from kidney disease. Even worse, the incidence
of kidney disease is reported to be 10.2–11.3% in China.1 Furthermore, acute renal failure plays an important
role in kidney disease. In that case, renal injury, which often occurs
in various clinical therapy, such as kidney transplantation,2 cardiac failure,3 kidney
vascular surgery,4 and shock resuscitation,5 induced by ischemia–reperfusion (I/R)
is the main reason of acute renal failure. This has been regarded
as a serious health problem in present society.6 A variety of drugs have been identified including propofol,7 erythropoietin,8 and
glutamine9 for treating renal I/R injury.
However, the efficacy of these pharmaceuticals for IR-induced renal
injury is still limited and these drugs are hard to translate into
clinical application.10 Therefore, there
is an urgent need for developing novel drugs for acute IR-induced
renal injury.

Therefore, we attempted to obtain an effective
but low-toxicity
drug to ameliorate the current conditions. In the current study, we
chose to construct an effective derivative through conjugating glucosamine
to celastrol (CLT), also known as tripterine, which was the major
biologically active component extracted from the traditional Chinese
medicinal herb, Tripterygium wilfordii Hook (also known as Thunder of God Vine).11

In previous studies, some research groups had successfully
proved
that CLT had diverse biological activities as an inhibitor of lipid
peroxidation12 and a downregulation mediator
of anti-inflammatory responses, such as interleukin-1α,13 tumor necrosis factor-α,14 and nuclear factor κB.15 Besides, CLT could also induce the heat shock response,16 increase the expression of cytoplasmic chaperones,
and activate unfolded protein response.17 Specially, because of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activity,
CLT was a potent agent for treating inflammatory disorders, such as
arthritis,18 atherosclerosis,19 allergic asthma,20 and Parkinson’s disease.21 Recently,
it was proven that CLT could protect cerebral ischemic injury and
reduce brain infarct volume as well as water content in a rat stroke
model.22 Furthermore, it also demonstrated
that CLT was able to cure acute kidney disease, which was verified
in protecting kidney I/R-induced injury.10 However, the long-term administration of CLT was always accompanied
by systemic toxicities and multiple adverse effects, such as blood
toxicity, hepatic damage, and reproductive disorder.23 Given those conditions, we focused on the development of
an alternative of CLT, seeking an identically efficient but a much
safer derivative.

In the current study, we developed an amide
derivative—celastrol–glucosamine
(CLG) conjugate—and investigated the pharmacological properties
mainly in efficacy and toxicity. The results suggested that the CLG could be used
in acute kidney disease and really kept enough safety in organs and
blood.

2 Results and Discussion
In the current
study, we synthesized a new celastrol–glucosamine
(CLG) conjugate, and, further, we verified that CLG could maintain
the efficacy as CLT and significantly decrease the adverse effects
on blood cells, liver, and testis. These results in rats suggested
that the CLG may have the opportunity to be further developed in clinical
trials.

2.1 Successful Synthesis and Characterization
of CLG
CLG was constructed as designed (Figure 1). The structure of CLG was
confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) and (1H NMR and 13C NMR). Yield was
20%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD): δ 7.26 (m,
1H), δ 6.71 (d, 1H), δ 6.44 (dd, 1H), δ 5.67 (M,
1H), δ 3.81–3.64 (m, 3H), δ 3.29 (m, 10H), δ
2.71 (m, 3H), δ 2.18–2.03 (m, 8H), δ 1.68 (m, 10H), 13C NMR (151 MHz, CD3OD): δ 182.96, 173.76,
168.32, 151.54, 139.66, 131.84, 125.09, 123.03, 122.56, 105.10, 82.22,
79.59, 75.07, 72.52, 65.71, 62.59, 61.52, 49.65, 49.01, 47.21, 46.37,
45.01, 44.27, 43.95, 42.89, 41.25, 39.92, 38.33, 36.59, 35.71, 35.35,
34.24, 33.69, 33.31, 26.56, 22.93, 15.25. ESI-MS: m/z [M + H]: 655.5 (Figures S1–S3).

Stability study showed that no
released CLT was found in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 24 h, which demonstrated that this
type of conjugate was highly stable (Figure 2).

CLG was incubated
with rat plasma, liver, or kidney homogenate for 24 h. All of the
mixtures were incubated at 37 ± 1 °C in the shaking bath,
and the samples were taken at the predetermined time points. Data

3).

2.2 Maintaining
Protective Effects of CLG against
Renal I/R Injury in Rats as CLT
To investigate the protective
effect of CLG on renal dysfunction caused by I/R injury, plasma creatinine
(Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels at 24 h after renal reperfusion
were measured (Figure 3A). Male SD rats (body weight of 200 ± 10 g) were randomly assigned
into four groups (n = 5): sham-operated group, I/R
group, I/R + CLT group, and I/R + CLG group. In this experiment, the
rats pretreated by CLG exhibited a significant
decrease in concentration of BUN and Cr in a dose-dependent manner,
similar to the rats pretreated with CLT (Figure 3A), compared with the sham group.

Figure 3 Therapeutic
effect of CLT and CLG on the renal function in the
I/R rats. (A) The plasma levels of BUN (A-a, A-c) and Cr (A-b, A-d)
were measured in rats that were pretreated with CLT (the dosage ranged
from 0.45 to 1.8 mg/kg) and CLG (the dosage ranged from 0.65 to 2.62
mg/kg) (all groups vs sham group, n = 5, mean ±
SD, ***p < 0.001). (B) The respective light photomicrographs
of hematoxylin–eosin (H&E)-stained renal tissue in rats
pretreated with 0.45 mg/kg of CLT and 0.65 mg/kg of CLG [the sham
group marked by (−); the I/R group marked by (+++); the CLT
group marked by (+); and the CLG group marked by (+)]. (C) Representative
light photomicrographs of TUNEL-stained kidney tissue. (D, E) The
effect of CLT and CLG on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) during renal I/R was detected
by immunohistochemical analysis. Original magnification in all of
the figures was 400×. All of the results are means of measurements
from five replicates. [(−) represented normal; (+) minimal
damage (less than 5% area of the cortex or outer medulla); (++) mild
damage (5–25% area of the cortex or outer medulla); (+++) moderate
damage (25–75% involvement of the cortex or outer medulla);
(++++) severe damage (more than 75% involvement of the cortex or outer
medulla)].

Then, the kidney was collected
at 24 h after renal reperfusion
with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining and tested for renal
damage score. The results suggested that there was no histological
change in the sham-operated group (Figure 3B). But for the I/R group (Figure 3B), the obvious renal damage
appeared, which was especially expressed in features of severe acute
tubular damage, including tubular cell swelling, tubular dilatation,
loss of brush border, and cellular infiltration. The symptomatic changes
were distributed in the whole kidney cortex. Compared with the I/R
group, these histological alterations were significantly attenuated
in rats pretreated with CLT and CLG (Figure 3B), although dilatation of tubular lumen
and degeneration of the renal tubular epithelial cells could still
be found. In brief, the score of renal damage in the I/R group was
much higher than that in the sham-operated group and the drug-given
groups.

Apoptosis of renal cells in situ was assessed by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Figure 3C). Only few apoptosis
could be detected in the sham-operated group, with the AI (apoptotic
index) of 15.25 ± 1.73%. However, there was significantly increased
apoptotic cells in the I/R group (Figure 3C), with the AI of 22.64 ± 0.62%. In
contrast, evident decline in the number of apoptotic cells was observed
in the I/R group pretreated by CLG (Figure 3C) with the AI of 16.41 ± 1.18%, similar
to the I/R group pretreated by CLT (Figure 3C) with the AI of 17.94 ± 0.63%.

According to the reported studies, the numbers of proinflammatory
mediators, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), would be elevated to a high
level in the ischemic organ diseases,24 suggesting that the severity of renal damage and dysfunction was
positively associated with proinflammatory mediator levels.25 Besides, CLT was quite effective to handle these
problems.10 Therefore, in the experiment,
we detected those proinflammatory mediators, including ICAM-1 and
iNOS, that always amplified the inflammatory response and deteriorated
tissue damage in morphology and function.26 ICAM-1 was mainly detected in the damaged tubular cells by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 3D). The expression
of ICAM-1 in the kidney tissues significantly increased in the I/R
group compared with those in the sham group, whereas the CLT and CLG
could markedly inhabit the expression of ICAM-1 induced by I/R injury.
In addition, the expression of iNOS appeared to be significantly increased
in the kidneys, mainly located in the renal tubular cells (Figure 3E). Similarly, the
pretreatment of CLT and CLG also blocked the increase in the iNOS
level. The results demonstrated that CLG could suppress the expression
of ICAM-1 and iNOS as same as CLT did.

Taken together, all of
those results implied that celastrol–glucosamine
(CLG) conjugate could alleviate the renal damage and decrease the
proinflammatory mediator caused by I/R injury as effectively as CLT.

2.3 CLG Reduced Adverse Effects in Blood System
Previous studies suggested that rats treated with CLT would suffer
developmental disorder of testicular atrophy, toxicity of blood system,
and damage of liver.23 Hence, we decided
to compare the adverse effects of CLT and CLG on rats for a long period.

To investigate the toxicity differences between CLT and CLG in
the blood system, both of them were injected into normal rats in the
condition of dose gradient. Rats were randomly divided into seven
groups of five animals each. A control group; and in regard to CLT and CLG group, we set up a serial of
dose gradient, in which the dose of CLT was 1.8, 0.9, and 0.45 mg/kg,
equaling the dose of CLG of 2.62, 1.31, and 0.65 mg/kg. Then, we measured
several blood routine indexes for 3 weeks, and it exhibited that CLT
drastically affected the number of blood cells, but CLG had little
influence on their number. In the results, white blood cells (WBCs)
were quite susceptive to the dose change in CLT but not sensitive
to the dose fluctuation of CLG (Figure 4A). Additionally, the number of lymphocytes (Figure 4B) and neutrophils
(Figure 4C) similarly
ranked to a high level after 3 week injection with CLT, which proved
that CLT indeed led blood system to a defensive behavior with a dose-dependent
tendency.

Figure 4 Toxicity of CLT and CLG in blood system. The number of WBC (A)
including lymphocyte (B) and granulocyte (C) in rats, which were respectively
injected with CLT and CLG, were measured for 3 weeks. The results
showed that the high dose (1.8 mg/kg) of CLT significantly contributed
to the surge in the leukocyte series cells. The count of red blood
cell (RBC) (D), hemoglobin (HGB) (E), and platelet (PLT) (F) were
analyzed. RBC and PLT were severely depressed by high dose (1.8 mg/kg)
of CLT and almost not influenced by CLG. All of the results are means
of measurements from five replicates.

Except for influencing WBC in the blood system, red blood
cells
(RBCs) were also profoundly impacted by CLT (Figure 4D), especially at a high dose, which could
significantly suppress the number of RBC and cause the downregulation
of hemoglobin (HGB) (Figure 4E). In the study, we observed that CLG always performed with
consistently stable safety even in the condition of high dose. Taken
together, it indicated that CLG also maintained safety to RBC.

Among all of the indexes, the count of blood platelet (PLT) also
conducted as a major criterion in the blood system. Apparently, CLT
could powerfully restrain the production of PLT, especially when given
in the dose of 1.8 mg/kg (Figure 4F). As was predicted, dose gradient of CLG had little
influence on the count of PLT, which manifested that the modified
compound had the ability to avoid the problem of coagulation dysfunction
that CLT always faced. Moreover, what was most interesting was that CLG kept the long-periodic
safety even up to 2.62 mg/kg, equaling the dose of CLT of 1.8 mg/kg.

As described above for routine analysis of blood, CLT exactly contributed
to surge in the leukocyte series cells, deregulation of RBC, and depression
of PLT, especially when the dose reached a high level. However, the
newly synthesized derivative, CLG, had little influence on the blood
cells, which was certainly up to our expectation.

2.4 No Obvious Harm to Normal Rat Liver in Gradient
Dose of CLG
Another factor limiting the use of CLT was that
it would partly impair the hepatic cells. As so, we further conducted
research on liver indexes, including plasma alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and H&E staining.

As was known, AST and ALT are important standards to appraise the
extent of damage, so this study consecutively detected the fluctuation
of numerical values for 3 weeks. What surprised us was that ALT (Figure 5A) in the CLT-treated
groups could keep the concentration as same as that in the control
group, but the concentration of AST (Figure 5B) was raised to exceed the average level.
According to the results, it demonstrated that CLT was really harmful
to hepatic cells, whereas CLG did have little effect, especially when
the dose approached the high level.

Figure 5 Effect of CLT and CLG on liver in normal
rats. The levels of ALT
(A) had no alteration and AST (B) reached a high degree when the dose
of CLT arrived 1.8 mg/kg. (C) The representative light photomicrographs
of H&E stained tissue from the liver. According to the damage
score, the control group is marked by (−), the CLT group by
(++), and the CLG group by (+). Original magnification in all of the
figures was 400×. All of the results are means of measurements
from five replicates.

To further certify the above-mentioned hepatotoxicity, H&E
staining was carried out for hepatic damage score. As a result, the
liver obtained from the high dose of CLT (1.8 mg/kg) demonstrated
obvious characteristics of lesion, including hepatocyte vacuolation,
cytoplasm mild swelling, liver sinusitis cell infiltration, and partial
liver cell degeneration (Figure 5C). However, the CLG group was really less harmful
to the hepatic cells, which maintained a better integrity in texture
and function (Figure 5C). These histological alterations almost did not obviously exist
in rats injected with CLG. Though the damage score of the CLG group
could not totally arrive at the level of the control group, at least,
it showed no obvious changes in the histology and morphology compared
with the CLT group. The damage score of CLT and CLG was kept as low
as that of the control group, when the injected dose was consistent
with the therapeutic dose in renal I/R rats (Figure S5).

CTL did damage liver of the rats; however, the parallel
experiment
confirmed that CLG could still maintain the hepatic basically healthy.

2.5 No Obvious Toxicity to Productive System of
CLG
To our knowledge, CLT was also restricted by reproductive
toxicity.23 Hence, in the present study,
we compared the toxic effects of CLG and CLT on rat testis. In the
current study, male rat testes collected after 3 week injection were
stained with H&E and tested for histologic lesion state. In the
CLT groups, especially when the dose reached a high level (Figure 6), evidence showed
that the testis tissue had damaged, including varying degrees of denaturation
necrosis in convoluted seminiferous tubules, thinning of the epithelium,
and absence of spermatozoa in spermatogenic cells. In contrast, the
CLG group did not have any focal changes whenever the dose changed
from 0.65 to 2.62 mg/kg. From the results, we could basically judge
that only when the dose of CLT reached a relative level was the lesion
of productive system toxicity obvious. On the contrary, the influence
of CLG on the testis tissue was always satisfactory, even up to a
high dose. Similarly, the CLG also had no toxicity on the testis of
normal rats at doses 0.65 and 1.31 mg/kg (Figure S6). The results of H&E staining examination indicated
that CLG induced little toxicity in the male reproductive system,
much lower than that caused by CLT when the dose of CLT was changed
from 0.45 to 1.8 mg/kg.

Figure 6 Representative light photomicrographs of H&E-stained
tissue
from the testis of rats treated with (A) 0.9% saline, (B) CLT (the
highest dose of 1.8 mg/kg), and (C) CLG (the highest dose of 2.61
mg/kg). Black arrows indicated areas of damage. According to the damage
score, the control group is marked by (−), the CLT group by
(+), and the CLG group by (−). The original magnification in
all of the figures was 400×. All of the results are means of
measurements from five replicates.

2.6 Quite Acceptable Safety of CLG in Kidney,
Spleen, Lung, and Heart
In the current study, we also verified
that CLG did not harm the kidneys in normal rats. The plasmatic Cr
(Figure 7A) and BUN
(Figure 7B) were examined,
which played an indispensable role in measuring the renal function.
The results indicated that the kidneys functioned very well during
the administration period of 3 weeks, which properly encouraged it
to be full of expectation. Incidentally, we parallelly studied the
renal toxicity of CLT. Interestingly, CLT also would not cause alterations
in kidney tissue even at the dose of 1.8 mg/kg. To further ensure
the safety of CLG and CLT in kidney, the kidney tissues collected
3 weeks after injection were stained with H&E and tested for renal
damage degree. Not surprisingly, there was no lesion region in the
whole kidney cortex (Figure 7C). The histological examination was totally in accordance
with the activity shown by BUN and Cr. Taken together, it demonstrated
that compared to CLT itself, the CLT derivative did not bring any
toxicity to rat kidneys (Figures 7C and S4).

Figure 7 Effect of CLT and CLG
on kidney in normal rats. The concentration
of plasma (A) Cr and (B) BUN were kept at a steady level, whatever
the dose of drugs the rats accepted for 3 weeks. (C) The histological
examination showed that CLT (the highest dose of 1.8 mg/kg) and CLG
(the highest dose of 2.61 mg/kg) had little influence on the renal
tissue. According to the damage score, the control group is marked
by (−), the CLT group by (−), and the CLG group by (−).
Original magnification in all of the figures was 400×. All of
the results are means of measurements from five replicates.

In addition to kidney, the other
organs, such as spleen, lung,
and heart, were removed from the rats and stained with H&E for
investigating the degree of damage. The H&E images of heart and
spleen did not show any obvious damage (Figures S7 and S8). The damage score of lung in the rats injected with
CLG was a little lower than that of the group injected with CLT (Figure S9). The CLG-treated group would dysfunction
this organ, including the infiltration of the interstitial inflammatory
cells, whereas the CLT-treated group did not cause any adverse effect
on lung tissue. Though the possibility that CLG would slightly increase
the toxicity, which was acceptable, in lung cells, was also confirmed
safe, and it could not cover up the main advance in decreasing the
CLT toxicity that heavily affected the treatment safety, especially,
in the plasma and the urogenital system. Therefore, clinical potential
of the novel derivative was promising. It suggested that we might
take advantage of both compounds to ameliorate the diseases in the
relative organs according to the different conditions.

Taken
together, the advance in protective advantages of CLG was
much more promising.

3 Conclusions
Celastrol–glucosamine
(CLG) conjugate was first designed
and successfully constructed from celastrol (CLT). The CLG could significantly
promote the renal recovery for renal I/R injury, similar to CLT, but
its toxicity in the blood system, liver, and testis was much slighter
than that of CLT. Our results illuminated that CLG would be a great
substitute of CLT for the treatment of acute ischemic failure.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Glucosamine
was purchased
from Kelong Chemical Reagent Factory (Chengdu, China). CLT (purity
of 99.0%) was supplied by Chengdu Must Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Chengdu,
China). Methanol (high-performance liquid chromatography grade) was
purchased from Kemiou (Tianjin, China). All of the other chemicals
and reagents were of analytical grade obtained commercially.

4.2 Animals
Sprague-Dawley rats (male;
body weight: 200 ± 20 g), provided by the West China Experimental
Animal Center of Sichuan University (Chengdu, China), were maintained
in a special environment and allowed free to food and water. All of
the procedures involving animals were approved by the Sichuan University
animal ethical experimentation committee, according to the requirements
of the National Act on the use of experimental animals (People’s
Republic of China).

4.3 Synthesis and Characterization
of 2-Glucosamine–Celastrol
Conjugate
1-(2-Aminoethoxy)-2-glucosamine was synthesized
and certified by our group in previous study,27 and there scarcely existed any isomer in the product. In the current
study, we just introduced the detailed synthetic method of CLG (Figure 1). Celastrol (1.11
mmol) and 1-(2-aminoethoxy)-2-glucosamine (4.44 mmol) were dissolved
in anhydrous DMF (15 mL) and cooled in ice–water mixture for
30 min. Benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate
(0.56 mmol) as a catalyst was dropped slowly into the reacting solution
in the condition of stirring, after which, the mixture was allowed
to warm up and stirred for another 1 h at room temperature (RT). Then, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.052 mmol)
was added into the mixture drop by drop and stirred for another 40
h until reacting fully. Then, dichloromethane (DCM) (40 mL) was added
and the mixture was re-extracted with pure water (20 mL each for 3
times). The aqueous layer was combined and evaporated. The residue
was purified with flash chromatography on silica gel giving the pure
product as a brownish red powder (mobile phase, DCM/methanol = 12:1).
Then, we attempted to investigate whether any diastereoisomer was
contained in the product by using a gradient elution in LC-MS, and
as expected, the results still maintained a single peek. Moreover,
we analyzed the 1H NMR and 13C NMR comprehensively,
which could contribute to excluding the possibility of enantiomer.

4.4 Surgical Procedure and Experimental Groups
The renal I/R model was established as described previously.28 Briefly, chloral hydrate (0.35 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally
administrated to anesthetize. Then, midline laparotomy was performed
and the bilateral renal were subjected to 60 min of ischemia by bilateral
renal arteries and veins clamping with no vascular damage followed
by reputation for 24 h. In the process, when the renal clamps have
been removed, the kidneys must be observed for 5 min with the aim
to ensure the reflow and then the incision sutured. After that, the
rats were placed in cages, which guaranteed the comfortable environment
to recover from anesthesia. Finally, the rats were sacrificed for
collecting plasma and kidney specimens (temporarily stored at −40
°C). Blood was obtained from the inferior caval vein and plasma
was immediately isolated by centrifugation (8000g, 5 min, 4 °C).

Before performing a midline laparotomy,
male SD rats (body weight of 200 ± 10 g) were randomly assigned
into four groups (n = 5): (1) sham-operated group,
in which the rats were subjected to the same surgical procedure as
described but had no induction of renal I/R; (2) I/R group, in which
the rats were injected with a vehicle solution via caudal vein 3 days
before standard surgical procedure; (3) I/R + CLT group, in which
the rats received CLT via caudal vein 3 days before renal ischemia;
and (4) I/R + CLG group, in which the rats were injected CLG via caudal
vein 3 days before renal ischemia. The vehicle-treated rats received
0.9% saline containing 1% Tween 80 and 10% absolute ethanol.

4.5 Renal Function Parameters for Pharmacological
Experiment
Creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
were measured by the assay of serum markers using a chemistry analyzer
(Hitachi 7020, Japan), respectively.

4.6 Histological
Examination for Pharmacological
Experiment
Twenty-four hours after the reperfusion, the rat
kidneys were collected and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for at least 48 h just at room temperature, dehydrated by grading
ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, the tissue specimens
were cut into 5 μm, placed on glass slides, deparaffinized with
xylene, hydrated with grading ethanol, and stained with the hematoxylin–eosin
(H&E) solution. For the histological evaluation, three kidney
sections per rat were examined under a light microscope (Media Cybernetics)
at the magnification 100× and 400× by the examiners, respectively.
The kidney damage features included tubular dilatation, tubular cell
swelling, brush border loss, and cytoplasmic vacuole. The renal injury
was semiquantitatively scored according to the standard described
previously: (−) represented normal kidney; (+) minimal damage
(less than 5% area of the cortex or outer medulla); (++) mild damage
(5–25% area of the cortex or outer medulla); (+++) moderate
damage (25–75% involvement of the cortex or outer medulla);
and (+++) severe damage (more than 75% involvement of the cortex or
outer medulla). Mean scores were presented per group.

Apoptosis
of kidney cells was identified by TUNEL assay using In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit (Roche Basel, Switzerland). The paraffin sections of
renal tissue (5 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated
in a graded ethanol series (100, 90, 80, and 70% for 3 min, respectively).
The tissue specimens were dealt with proteinase K for 25 min at room
temperature. Then, the sections were stained with preparation of new
TUNEL reactive solution, in contrast with positive and negative control
groups. Subsequently, 50 μL converter peroxidase was added to
the tissue sections for reacting half an hour at room temperature.
Finally, 50–100 μL chromogenic reagent diaminobenzidine
(DAB) was dropwise added into staining close to 10 min, observed at
25 °C. For appropriate assessment, photomicrographs were taken
with a microscope camera (BA400 Digital, Mike audi industrial group
Co. Ltd.) at a 100× magnification and 4× magnification,
respectively. The percentage of apoptotic cells, apoptotic index,
was calculated as the ratio of the number of TUNEL-positive cells
to the total number of cells, calculated in five different random
fields.

4.7 Immunohistochemical Staining
Immunohistochemical
staining was performed with the Polink-2 Plus Polymer HRP Detection
System (Zhongshan Biosciences Inc., China) using the reported protocol.
Briefly, paraffin-embedded kidneys were cut at a thickness of 5 μm,
then deparaffinized and hydrated. The sections were subjected to methanol
hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the
sections were put in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for incubation
at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, the sections were washed with
PBS for 5 min (2×). Subsequently, the sections were incubated
with the primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) against
the intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1 (1:100; Abcam) and inducible
nitric oxide synthase iNOS (1:100; Zhongshan Biosciences Inc.) overnight
at 4 °C. The sections were washed with PBS for 3 times. Then,
the sections were added with diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic agent
for reacting 2 min and terminated with running water. The sections
were counter-stained with hematoxylin and mounted with resinene. The
yellowish-brown signals were considered as positive staining, which
was detected under a light microscope (BA400 digital, China) at the
magnification of 400×.

4.8 Toxicity Assays in Blood
and Organs
Rats were randomly divided into seven groups of
five animals each.
In regard to CLT and CLG, we set a serial dose gradient, in which
the sequence dose of CLT was 1.8, 0.9, and 0.45 mg/kg, equaling the
sequence of CLG at the dose of 2.62, 1.31, and 0.65 mg/kg. In addition,
the control group was injected with the vehicle solution, which consisted
of 0.1% Tween-80, 10% absolute ethyl alcohol, and 0.9% saline. All
of the groups were administrated 3 times per week for 3 weeks by intravenous
injection. All of the rats were weighed every other day to ensure
accurate dosing.

During the period of drug delivery, the whole
blood was collected by anticoagulated blood-collection tube through
the way of orbital blood. Meanwhile, we also collected part of blood
in ordinary plastic centrifuge tube and obtained the serum after centrifugation
for 8 min by 8000g. As for the whole blood, it was
examined by an automatic biochemical analyzer (Hitachi 7020, Japan),
and we could get the information concerning white blood cells (WBCs),
red blood cells (RBCs), and platelets (PLTs). As for the serum, it
was analyzed for the activity of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) using the Hitachi automatic biochemical analyzer.

After
3 weeks, the organs, including heart, liver, spleen, lung,
kidney, and testis, were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for at least 48 h at room temperature, dehydrated by grading ethanol,
and embedded in paraffin. Three sections per rat were counter-stained
with H&E and observed under a light microscope (Media Cybernetics)
at the magnification 100× and 400×. The main aims were to
examine whether CLT and CLG could bring alterations to the organs
in normal rats.
