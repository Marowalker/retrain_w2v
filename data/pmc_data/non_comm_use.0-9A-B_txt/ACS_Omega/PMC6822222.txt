Aza-annulation
of novel 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline derived
enaminones and nitroenamines with various 1,2- and 1,3-bis electrophiles,
such as oxalyl chloride, maleic anhydride, 1,4-benzoquinone, 3-bromopropionyl
chloride, itaconic anhydride, and imines (from formaldehyde and primary
amines), has been investigated. These methodologies provide simple
one-step pathways for efficient construction of highly functionalized
tetrahydro-β-carboline 1,2-fused, five- and six-membered heterocyclic
frameworks, such as indolizino[8,7-b]indoles, pyrido[1,2-a:3,4-b′]diindoles,
indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidines, and pyrimido[1′,6′:1,2]pyrido[3,4-b]indoles, which are core structures of many naturally occurring
indole alkaloids with diverse bioactivity.

Introduction
The indole structure
is regarded as one of the most privileged
classes of heterocycles representing structural core of many natural
and non-natural compounds with a range of biological activities.1 The indole alkaloids have been a subject of intense
structural, pharmacological, biosynthetic and synthetic studies, because
of the structural diversity and complexity of many of its members,
along with the important physiological and medicinal properties displayed
by this class of compounds.2 Similarly,
natural product inspired compounds based on polycyclic indole alkaloids
also exhibit interesting biological activities.3 Therefore, the development of new synthetic methods that
allow rapid and efficient access to these natural and non-natural
indole-containing scaffolds has attracted much attention for several
decades among organic as well as medicinal chemists.3

Tetrahydro-β-carboline constitutes a recurring
subunit in
numerous indole alkaloids;4 besides, they
are also templates for drug discovery and have been used as scaffolds
for combinatorial libraries.4a,4b Therefore, the construction
of structurally novel, non-natural alkaloid type polycyclic heterocyclic
scaffolds containing this subunit is a highly challenging and rewarding
endeavor in the fast emerging area of oriented synthesis.

Enaminoketones,
esters, and nitriles, including nitroenamines,
have been shown to be versatile building blocks for the synthesis
of various five- and six-membered heterocycles and are frequently
used in domino and multicomponent reactions, because of the rich reactive
sites present in these intermediates.5 However,
the corresponding heterocyclic enaminones/esters derived from tetrahydro-β-carboline
framework have not been much explored for the construction of indole-annulated
heterocycles, despite their considerable synthetic potential,4a,6 although acyclic β-enaminoesters generated from the reaction
of tryptamine and alkyl propiolates have been frequently employed
as useful building blocks for construction of indole-annulated heterocycles
via the sequential Pictet–Spengler reaction.7a,7b

We have previously reported an efficient general approach
for the
synthesis of 6,7-dimethoxytetrahydroisoquinoline-derived push-pull
enaminones/esters/nitriles of the general structure 2 and their subsequent synthetic elaboration to tetrahydroisoquinoline-fused
five- and six-membered heterocycles 3 (Scheme 1).8 The overall process involves the Bischler–Napieralski type
cyclization of newly synthesized ketene N,S-acetals 1 derived from 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine
and polarized ketene dithioacetals8a and
subsequent aza-annulation of the resulting enaminones/nitroenamines 2 with two or three carbon 1,2- and 1,3-electrophilic species,
affording highly functionalized isoquinoline-fused five- and six-membered
heterocycles, such as pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines,8b,8d indolo[2,1-a]isoquiolines,8b and substituted benzo[a]quinolizidin-4-one and
pyrimido[6,1-a]isoquinoline structural motifs8d present in several naturally occurring alkaloids
and physiologically active drugs (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Aza-Annulation of Isoquinoline-Derived
Enaminones/Nitroenamine to
Tetrahydroisoquinoline-Fused Five- and Six-Membered Heterocycles
Our fascination with this class of molecules
prompted us to extend
these studies for the synthesis of tetrahydro-β-carboline-derived
functionalized push-pull enamines, as potentially useful building
blocks for the synthesis of 1,2-heteroannulated tetrahydro-β-carbolines-derived
5–6 membered heterocycles and related natural products. Thus,
we had previously reported the synthesis of a series of functionalized
1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline-derived enaminones/esters/nitriles 7 via trifluoroacetic acid-induced Bischler–Napieralski
type cyclization of newly prepared polarized ketene N,S-acetals 6 from tryptamine 4 and polarized ketene S,S-acetals 5 (Scheme 2).4a

Scheme 2 Synthesis of β-Carboline-Derived
Push-Pull Enaminones
On the basis of our
previous studies, with tetrahydroisoquinoline-based
enaminones (Scheme 1),8b,8c we anticipated that tetrahydro-β-carboline-derived
enaminones and nitroenamines such as 7 could also be
employed in efficient aza-annulation reactions with various 1,2- and
1,3-biselectrophiles, leading to a variety of tetrahydro-β-carboline
1,2-annulated five- and six-membered heterocycles (Scheme 3). Also, because of our previous
experience in exploring the reactivity and synthetic potential of
polarized ketene N,S-acetals as
functionalized enaminones,9 we also envisioned
the possibility of synthesizing the target tetrahydro-β-carboline-fused
heterocycles, directly from acyclic N,S-acetals 6,with concurrent formation of both tetrahydropyridine
and 5/6 membered rings in a tandem one-pot operation (Scheme 3). The results of these studies
have been presented in the following section, and we now report in
the present paper, one-step synthetic elaboration of a few of these
enaminones/nitroenamine 7 to 1,2-tetrahydro-β-carboline-annulated
heterocycles, such as substituted dihydroindolizino[8,7-b]indoles, pyrido[1,2-a:3,4-b′]diindole, indolo-[2,3-a]quinolizidines, their benzo-fused
analogues, and other novel heterocyclic scaffolds (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Tetrahydro-β-Carboline-Fused
Five- and Six-Membered
Heterocycles
Results and Discussion
We first examined the cycloannulation of few β-carboline-derived
enaminones and nitroenamine 7, with oxalyl chloride,
and maleic anhydride with a view to synthesize dihydroindolizino[8,7-b]indole derivatives (Schemes 5 and 6). Indolizino[8,7-b]indole represents an
important class of the indole-containing heterocyclic core present
in several naturally occurring bioactive alkaloids, such as harmicine,
pegaharmalines B, and also in synthetic pharmacologically active compounds
such as human CCK1 receptor antagonists (Figure 1).7a−7c,10 Several synthetic approaches for the construction
of this heterocyclic core have been reported in recent years.7−14 In most of these protocols, the pyrrole ring of the indolizino[8,7-b]indole framework has been constructed in various ways.
Thus, Knolker and co-workers have reported a two-step procedure for
the construction of the pyrrole ring by addition of a propargyl Grignard
reagent to 3,4-dihydro-β-carboline and subsequent silver(I)-promoted
oxidative cyclization of the resulting adduct.12 The pyrrole ring has also been constructed by several research
groups via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of tetrahydro-β-carboline-derived
azomethine ylides13a (or munchnones13b) with various dipolarophiles, including a photoredox-catalyzed
oxidation/1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reported by Maurya and co-workers.13c Functionalized tetrahydroindolizino[8,7-b]indoles have also been obtained via a one-pot or stepwise
reaction of tryptamine, alkyl propiolates, and β-nitroalkenes/α,β-unsaturated
ketones via intermediacy of acyclic β-enaminoesters, with concomitant
formation of both tetrahydropyridine and pyrrole ring in a domino
fashion.7a,7b Wu and co-workers have recently reported
the acid-catalyzed multicomponent cyclization protocol for the synthesis
of polyfunctional dihydroindolizino[8,7-b]indoles
from readily available arylglyoxal monohydrates, tryptamine, and β-nitrostyrenes
or malononitrile.10,14

compounds with dihydroindolizino
[8,7-b]indole moiety.

For our study, the desired enaminones 7a–f and
nitroenamine 7g were synthesized according to our earlier
reported procedure,4a as shown in the Scheme 4. We first examined
the reactions of enaminones 7a,b,d and nitroenamine 7g with oxalyl chloride, with a view to synthesize indolizino[8,7-b]indole-2,3-diones 8 (Scheme 5). Thus, under optimized reaction conditions, when the enaminone 7a was reacted with oxalyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature, work-up and purification
of the crude reaction mixture afforded a red crystalline solid, in
76% yield, which was characterized as the expected 1-benzoyl-6,11-dihydro-5H-indolizino[8,7-b]indole-2,3-dione 8a on the basis of its spectral and analytical data (Scheme 5). Similarly, the
corresponding 4-chlorobenzoyl and acetyl-substituted enaminones 7b and 7d also reacted with oxalyl chloride under
identical conditions, yielding the corresponding indolizino[8,7-b]indole-2,3-diones 8b and 8d in
high yields. Alternatively, we also reacted the corresponding tryptamine-derived
acyclic N,S-acetals 6a,b, 6d with oxalyl chloride under similar conditions,
expecting the formation of the desired indolizino[8,7-b]indole-2,3-diones 8 in a domino fashion, with concomitant
formation of both the rings via intramolecular cyclization of the
initially formed N-substituted 4-benzoyl-5-methylthiopyrrolidin-2,3-diones 9 (Scheme 5). Indeed, the reactions proceeded as expected, yielding the desired
tetracyclic indolizino[8,7-b]indole-2,3-diones 8a,b,d in comparatively better yields (route b, Scheme 5). However, the corresponding
cyclic nitroenamine 7g or the acyclic nitroketene N,S-acetal 6g failed to furnish
the desired 1-nitro-indolizino[8,7-b]indole-2,3-dione 8g under above described conditions, yielding only an intractable
reaction mixture (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of 1-Acyl-6,11-dihydro-5H-indolizino
[8,7-b]indole-2,3-diones
With the successful isolation of indolizino[8,7-b]indole-2,3-diones 8 from the reactions of enaminones 7 with oxalyl chloride, we next investigated aza-annulation
of enaminones 7 with maleic anhydride 10, with a view to synthesize functionalized indolizino[8,7-b]indoles such as 11 with an acetic acid side
chain (Scheme 6). Aza-annulation of a few acyclic and cyclic
enaminones/esters/nitriles with maleic anhydride/maleimide has been
reported in the literature affording substituted monocyclic and bicyclic
pyrrolidinones;8b,15 however, cycloannulation of tetrahydro-β-carboline-derived
enaminones such as 7 with maleic anhydride has not been
investigated. Thus, when the enaminone 7a was reacted
with an equimolar quantity of maleic anhydride in solvents such as
benzene, toluene, and acetonitrile under reflux conditions, the product
isolated after work-up was characterized as expected 2-(1-benzoyl-3-oxo-3,5,6,11-tetrahydro-2H-indolizino[8,7-b]indol-2-yl)acetic acid 11a, with the help of spectral and analytical data (Scheme 6). However, the best
yield (60%) of 11a was obtained in refluxing acetonitrile,
whereas in other solvents, formation of side products was observed
along with 11a. Similarly the 4-chlorobenzoyl-substituted
enaminone 7b also afforded the substituted indolizino[8,7-b]indole-2-acetic acid 11b in good yield (Scheme 6). However, the corresponding
nitroenamine 7g, although reacted completely with maleic
anhydride under identical conditions, the products could not be isolated
in their pure form, even after repeated column chromatography. Similarly,
attempted domino cyclization of N,S-acetal 6a with maleic anhydride was not successful
and neither the tetracyclic product 11a nor the pyrrolidinone
intermediate 12a could be isolated from the reaction
mixture (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Cycloannulation of Enaminones 7 with
Maleic Anhydride
We next extended our
aza-annulation strategy for the synthesis
of pyrido[1,2-a:3,4-b′]diindole
analogues via a Nenitzescu type reaction of enaminones 7 with 1,4-benzoquinone (Scheme 7).8b This pentacyclic pyrido[1,2-a:3,4-b′]diindole framework constitutes
the core structure of several marine alkaloids, including red pigment
fascaplysin, homofascaplysins B,C, and their bromo-analogues (Figure 2).16 Fascaplysin displays a broad range of biological activities,
such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antimalarial, HIV-1-RT,
and especially inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4, which regulates
the G0–G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle.16,17 Therefore, there is considerable interest in the synthesis and development
of fascaplysin and its analogues, as lead compounds for potential
anticancer drugs and for other therapeutic applications.16,17 Similarly, naturally occurring alkaloids cladoniamide G possessing
an unprecedented indolotryptoline skeleton have also shown to display
significant toxicity against human colon and breast cancer (Figure 2).18

Scheme 7 Synthesis of 2-Hydroxy-13-acyl/nitro-12H-pyrido[1,2-a:3,4-b′]diindole
by Cycloannulation
of Enaminones 7 with 1,4-Benzoquinone
Although the Nenitzescu reaction for the synthesis of
5-hydroxyindole
has been widely studied and various acyclic and cyclic enaminoesters/enaminones
have been employed as enamine components in this reaction,5a the corresponding heterocyclic enaminones such
as 7a–d or nitroenamine 7g derived
from β-carboline have not been explored for the construction
of the pyridodiindole framework. On the basis of our previous studies
with tetrahydroisoquinoline-derived enaminones,8b we have developed a new one-step procedure for the synthesis
of the novel pentacyclic pyrido[1,2-a:3,4-b′]diindole framework through the Nenitzescu reaction
of enaminones 7 with 1,4-benzoquinone (Scheme 7). Thus, the reaction of 7a with 1,4-benzoquinone in either refluxing acetic acid or
in presence of ZnCl2 catalyst (20 mol %)5a in dichloromethane yielded only a complex mixture of products;
however, when the enaminone 7a was stirred with 1,4-benzoquinone
in nitromethane for 2 days under our earlier described conditions,8b,8e the reaction mixture after a usual work-up and purification yielded
a yellow solid (58%) characterized as 6,7-dihydro-2-hydroxy-13-bezoyl-12H-pyrido[1,2-a:3,4-b′]diindole 13a (Scheme 7). Similarly, the other substituted enaminones 7b,c also
underwent cycloannulation with 1,4-benzoquinone under identical conditions
furnishing the corresponding 2-hydroxy-13-aroyldihydropyridodiindoles 13b,c in moderate to good yields (Scheme 7). Interestingly, the nitroenamine 7g could also be reacted with benzoquinone, yielding the corresponding
hitherto unreported 2-hydroxy-13-nitropyridodiindole analogue 13g, although in low yield (35%) (Scheme 7).

We next investigated aza-annulation
of enaminones 7 with 3-bromopropionyl chloride and itaconic
anhydride with a view
to construct indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidine-4-one frameworks
(Schemes 8 and 9). The indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidine structural motif is of significant importance,
since this privileged structure is present in a plethora of numerous
naturally occurring, bioactive indole alkaloids,1d,6b,19 such as deplancheine, geissoschizine, dihydrocorynantheine,
including ajmalicine, and yohimbane, a potent modulator of tubulin
cytoskeleton, and important anticancer drugs (Figure 3).3 Because of
their complex structures and pharmacological properties, new synthetic
routes for the construction of this tetracyclic indolo[2,3-a]quinolizin-4-ones with diverse functionalities have attracted
much attention, among synthetic as well as medicinal chemists.20 Some of the recent approaches for the construction
of this challenging heterocyclic target involve cyclization of N-acyliminium ion on the pendant indole ring,20a,20b Bischler–Napieralski reaction,21a and Fischer Indole synthesis.21b

Franzén22 and Wu’s23 groups have
recently developed facile organocatalytic
enantioselective one-pot, three- component, cascade approaches for
highly substituted indoloquinolizidines, involving a Michael addition-Pictet–Spengler
sequence of β-ketoesters (or alkyl propiolates), α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes, and tryptamine. Muller and co-workers4b have reported a sequential, four-component synthesis of
highly substituted indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidin-4-ones
by Sonogashira coupling of acid chlorides, terminal alkynes, followed
by amination with a tryptamine, aza-annulation-Pictet–Spengler
sequence.

A few of the indoloquinolizidin-4-ones have also been
synthesized
by aza-annulation of β-carboline-derived enaminoester with acrylate
derivatives in moderate to good yields.6a Du and co-workers have recently reported a novel synthetic approach
to functionalized indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidones via
N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed annulations of β-carboline-derived
enamino ester with enals.6b,24

In our study,
we first examined cycloannulation of enaminones 7a, 7d, and nitroenamine 7g with
3-bromopropionoyl chloride 15 with a view to synthesize
1-aroyl/nitro-tetrahydroindolo[2,3-a]quinolizin-4-ones 14 (Scheme 8). Thus, under optimized reactions conditions, when 7a was reacted with 3-bromopropionoyl chloride 15 in refluxing
THF and triethylamine, the reaction proceeded smoothly, yielding the
desired indoloquinolizidin-4-one 14a in 65% yield. Alternatively,
we also attempted one-pot tandem cyclization of open-chain N,S-acetal 6a with 15, under identical conditions, and to our delight, indoloquinolizidinone 14a was obtained in increased yield of 75%, without isolation
of the corresponding tetrahydro-2-pyridone intermediate 16a (Scheme 8). The corresponding
1-acetyl and hitherto unreported 1-nitroindoloquinolizidinone 14d and 14g were similarly obtained in good yields
from respective cyclic enaminone 7d, 7g or
the corresponding N,S-acetals 6d and 6g under identical conditions (Scheme 8).

With the
successful synthesis of 1-substituted tetrahydroindolo[2,3-a]quinazolidones 14 by cycloannulation of enaminones 7 with 3-bromopropionyl chloride, we next examined the aza-annulation
of enaminones 7a–c and nitroenamine 7g with itaconic anhydride 18, with anticipation to synthesize
functionalized indoloquinolizidin-4-ones 17, bearing
an acetic acid side chain (Scheme 9). There are very few reports of aza-annulation of
enamine substrates with exocyclic anhydrides, like itaconic anhydride 18.4a,9a Thus, when enaminone 7a was reacted with itaconic anhydride in refluxing acetonitrile, under
our previously described conditions,4a,9a work-up and
purification of the reaction mixture yielded a single product, which
was found to be the expected 1-benzoyl-indolo[2,3-a]quinolizin-4-one-3-acetic acid 17a (62%) on the basis
of its spectral and analytical data (Scheme 9). Similarly, the enaminones 7b,c and the nitroenamine 7g also reacted with itaconic
anhydride 18 under identical conditions furnishing the
corresponding 1-aroyl- and 1-nitroindolo[2.3-a]quinolizido-4-one-3-acetic
acids 17b,c, 17g in good yields (Scheme 9). In an alternative
procedure, the acyclic N,S-acetal 6a was reacted with itaconic anhydride 18 with
a view to obtain the target functionalized indolo[2,3-a]quinolizinone 17a in a tandem one-pot operation. However,
when 6a was reacted with 18 in refluxing
acetotonitrile, the product isolated was found to be only acyclic
substituted dihydropyridone 19a (70%), which did not
cyclize to indoloquinolizidone 17a even on prolonged
heating of the reaction mixture (Scheme 9). However, treatment of the isolated dihydropyridone 19a with trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature furnished
the quinolizidone 17a in good yield (64%, Scheme 9). In fact, it was not necessary
to purify the pyridone 19a and the crude reaction mixture
after evaporation of acetonitrile (from the reaction of 6a and itaconic anhydride), affording 17a in comparable
yield, on treatment with trifluoroacetyl (TFA).

We also subjected
2-chloro/bromobenzoylenaminones, such as 7c, 7e,f, to intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic
substitution (SNAr), with a view to synthesize pentacyclic
dihydroindolo[2′,3′:3,4]pyrido[1,2-a]quinolin-2-ones 20 (Scheme 10).25 Thus, when o-chlorobenzoylenaminone 7c was heated in in
either dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence
of bases like K2CO3, Cs2CO3, or sodium t-butoxide at higher temperature for
a prolonged time, the desired product 20c was formed
in varying yields; however, the best yield (71%) of 20c was obtained when N,S-acetal 7c was heated in DMSO for 12h at 120 °C (Scheme 10). Similarly, the other substituted o-halobenzoyl enaminones 7e,f also underwent
intramolecular nucleophilic substitution to give the corresponding
indolo-fused dihydroindolopyridoquinolin-2-ones 20e,f in high yields. However, the products 20e,f were found
to be highly insoluble and 20e could be characterized
by 1H NMR/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data,
whereas 20f, only by HRMS.

Scheme 10 Synthesis of Pentacyclic
Dihydroindolo[2′,3′:3,4]pyrido[1,2-a]quinolin-2-ones
Finally, we also
synthesized a few of the 2,3,4,6,7,12-hexahydropyrimido[1′,6′:1,2]pyrido[3,4-b]indoles 21a–c via cycloannulation
of enaminones and nitroenamines 7a, 7g via
the double Mannich reaction with formaldehyde and primary amines (Scheme 11). Thus, when the
enaminone 7a was stirred with formaldehyde and benzylamine
at room temperature in solvents like THF, CH2Cl2, acetonitrile, and benzene, starting materials remained unchanged
whereas in methanol as solvent, the corresponding 1-benzoyl-3-N-benzylhexahydropyrimido[1′,6′:1,2]pyrido[3,4-b]indole 21a was obtained in 65% yield. On
the other hand, annulation of nitroenamine 7e with formaldehyde
and benzyl or furfuryl amines was found to be very facile, providing
the corresponding, 1-nitro-3-benzyl/furfuryl-hexahydrpyrimido[1′,6′:1,2]pyrido[3,4-b]indoles 21b,c in 80 and 91% yields, respectively
(Scheme 11). Some
of these compounds are shown to be a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation.26

Conclusions
In
summary, we have carried out a detailed study of aza-annulation
of newly synthesized β-carboline-derived enaminones and nitroenamines
with various 1,2- or 1,3-biselectrophilic species, like oxalyl chloride,
maleic anhydride, 1,4-benzoquinone, 3-bromopropionyl chloride, itaconic
anhydride, etc. and successfully developed convenient one-pot protocols
for the construction of a variety of novel β-carboline 1,2-fused
highly functionalized five- and six-membered tetra- and pentacyclic
heterocyclic motifs, in reasonable yields. It should be noted that,
while there are few reports of aza-annulation of β-carboline-derived
enaminoesters (or in situ generated acyclic enaminoester from tryptamine
and ethyl propiolate) furnishing tetrahydroindolizino[8,7-b]indoles or indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidines
derivatives, the synthesis and reactivity of the corresponding β-carboline-derived
enaminones and especially nitroenamines have not been explored. Also,
the aza-annulations of these β-carboline-derived enamines with
maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, and 1,4-bezoquinone have not
been reported in the literature. These novel protocols provide a rapid
and efficient access to biologically important non-natural indole
alkaloids in a highly concise fashion. The overall study reveals the
possibility of construction of a range of novel substituted β-carboline-fused
heterocyclic scaffolds with potential biological activity employing
this protocol.
