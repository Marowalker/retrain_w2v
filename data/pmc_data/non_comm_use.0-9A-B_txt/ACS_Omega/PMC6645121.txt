A dual-emission pyrene-based new
fluorescent probe (N-(4-nitro-phenyl)-N′-pyren-1-ylmethyl-ene-ethane-1,2-diamine
(PyDA-NP)) displays green fluorescence for nitric oxide (NO) sensing,
whereas it exhibits blue emission in the aggregated state. The mechanism
of nitric oxide (NO/NO+) sensing is based on N-nitrosation
of aromatic secondary amine, which was not interfered by reactive
oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. The aggregation-induced
enhancement of emission (AIEE) behaviors of the PyDA-NP could be attributed
to the restriction of intramolecular rotation and vibration, resulting
in rigidity enhancement of the molecules. The AIEE behavior of the
probe was well established from fluorescence, dynamic light scattering,
scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
diffraction, optical fluorescence microscopy, and time-resolved photoluminescence
studies. In a H2O/CH3CN binary mixture (8:2
v/v), the probe showed maximum aggregation with extensive (833-fold)
increases in fluorescence intensity and high quantum yield (0.79).
The aggregated state of the probe was further applied for the detection
of nitroexplosives. It displayed efficient sensing of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
(TNP), corroborating mainly the charge-transfer process from pyrene
to a highly electron-deficient TNP moiety. Furthermore, for the on-site
practical application of the proposed analytical system, a contact-mode
analysis was performed.

Introduction
The role of nitric
oxide (NO), a redox molecule, as a key mediator
of immunity has recently garnered renewed interest and appreciation.
It plays key roles in mammalian biology such as (a) in signal transductions
in the central nervous system, (b) in inflammatory response, (c) in
modulations of ion channels, and (d) in cardiovascular homeostasis.1−4 It is also an integral part of the immune system. As a result, monitoring
of the concentration of NO in a biological system is crucial. The
quantification of trace amount of NO in a biological system is very
difficult as it is highly reactive and rapidly scavenged and persists
in a wide range of physiologically relevant concentrations.5 Again, nitrosonium ion (NO+), an oxidized
form of nitric oxide, is the key species in the process of nitrosation
reactions, which most likely occur through electrophilic attack by
NO/N2O3 on a nucleophile center such as thiols/amines
to generate S-nitrosothiols or N-nitrosamines.6,7

The van der Waals-like attractive
forces between molecules are
responsible for self-association in solution or at the solid–liquid
interface, which exhibit distinct changes in the absorption/emission
bands as compared to those of the monomeric species. The spectral
shifts tell us about the various aggregation patterns. The molecular
exciton coupling theory, i.e., coupling of transition moments of the
constituent probe molecules, successfully explains the occurrence
of bathrochromically shifted J-bands and hypsochromically shifted
H-bands of the aggregates. The aggregation of a fluorophore (FL) is
a natural process; however, it may play both a positive and a negative
role in the enhancement of the emission of a fluorophore. The aggregation-induced
emission (AIE) was first coined in 2001 to indicate luminogen aggregation
with enhancing its emission.8,9 Contrary to the conventional
emitters, the AIEgens are weakly emissive or nonemissive in dilute
solutions but emit efficiently in the aggregated or solid states,
which may arise due to restriction of intramolecular motions like
intramolecular rotation (RIR) and intramolecular vibration (RIV).10−13 Attracted by this intriguing phenomenon, a large number of AIEgens
with diversified architectures and versatile properties have been
generated and applied in organic light-emitting devices, chemo- and
biosensors, biological imaging, etc.14−17

Detection of explosives
is of extreme importance due to the intimidation
for human security as a result of illegal transport, terrorist activities,
and forensic investigations.18−21 Trinitrophenol (TNP) was the first highly explosive
nitrated organic compound that is widely considered suitable to withstand
the shock of firing in conventional artillery. Apart from its highly
explosive nature, TNP also causes severe irritation, dizziness, nausea,
skin allergy, and damage of kidney and liver. It is also an important
basic compound for fungicides, analytical reagents, fireworks, staining
agents, and germicides and also used in glasses, matches, and leathers.22 The commercial production of TNP or its uses
may cause release of TNP in the environment, leading to the contamination
of aquatic systems and thus also of drinking water resources. TNP
gets converted into picramic acid (2-amino-4,6-dinitrophenol) during
the mammalian metabolic processes, which shows more mutagenic activity
than TNP itself.23 Therefore, quick and
specific recognition of TNP is very important. For the detection of
explosives, various methods are available, such as gas chromatography,
ion-mobility spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy.19 Among these different techniques, the fluorescence-quenching-based
technique is a favored one for molecular sensing24−34 because it is highly sensitive, specific, fast, simple, and cost-effective.

In this research endeavor, we have designed a smart molecular probe
which exhibits water-mediated aggregation-induced enhancement of emission
(AIEE) (λem = 467 nm), which on further treatment
with trinitrophenol (TNP) exhibits selective fluorescence quenching
over other nitrated compounds,
indicating the sensing of TNP in the blue zone. In addition, it also
displays selective sensing of nitric oxide (NO) and NO+ in the (λem = 523 nm) green zone by the intramolecular
charge-transfer (ICT) mechanism. A number of fluorescent probes for
selective sensing of NO have been exploited till date using different
fluorophores (FLs). The mechanism of NO sensing is based on (a) selective
reaction of NO (Scheme 1) with o-phenylenediamine35−37 to form triazole,
(b) diazo ring formation,38,39 (c) oxidative deamination,40−42 and (d) reaction of NO with thiosemicarbazide,43 leading to the formation of oxadiazole. All of these lead
to the enhancement of emission. Here, we have developed a new pyrene-based
probe (Scheme 2) for
the selective detection of NO via the N-nitrosation44,45 reaction with a huge increase (66-fold) in fluorescence intensity
(FI). Pyrene is a very important moiety to make dyes or dye precursors,
and its derivatives are widely used as fluorescent sensors for lanthanide
ions, adenosine triphosphate, G-quadruplex DNA, etc. in aqueous solutions.
Here, for the first time, we have designed and synthesized a pyrene
derivative for sensing of nitric oxide.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
1-Pyrenecarboxaldehyde,
4-nitrochlorobenzene,
ethylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich), absolute ethanol, salts of cations
like Ca2+, Al3+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Cu2+, K+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Na+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ and different reactive molecules/ions
like •OH, H2O2, NO3–, O2–, ClO–, (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) radical, NO2–, ONOO–, ascorbic acid
(AA), dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), and DEA-NONOate as well as 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
(TNP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), p-choloronitrobenzene (Cl-NB), m-dinitrobenzene (DNB),
3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (DNBA), and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA) were
obtained from commercial suppliers and Sigma-Aldrich, which were used
without further purification. The reagent-grade solvents like CH3CN (Merck, India), MeOH, and tetrahydrofuran were dried before
use.

Physical Measurements
A PerkinElmer RX I Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer was used to record Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra in the range 4000–400 cm–1 in solid KBr disks. To record UV–vis spectra, an Agilent
8453 diode-array spectrophotometer was used, whereas fluorescence
spectra were recorded on a PTI (model QM-40) spectrofluorimeter. 1H and 13C NMR data were recorded on a Bruker 300
MHz spectrometer using trimethylsilane as an internal standard in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6. To obtain
the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS+)
(m/z) spectra of the amine (L1), probe (N-(4-Nitro-phenyl)-N′-pyren-1-ylmethyl-ene-ethane-1,2-diamine (PyDA-NP)), and
the reaction product (PyDA-NP–NO), an high-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) spectrometer (model no: QTOF Micro YA263) was
used. Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements
were carried out on a Hamamatsu MCP photomultiplier (R3809) and analyzed
by IBH DAS6 software embedded with a nanosecond diode laser (IBH Nanoled-07)
in an IBH fluorocube apparatus.

Solution Preparation for
UV–Vis Absorption and Fluorescence
Studies
For UV–vis as well as fluorescence titrations,
a 1.0 × 10–3 M stock solution of PyDA-NP was
prepared in CH3CN and 1.0 × 10–2 M stock solution of NOBF4 was prepared in dry CH3CN. Similarly, 1.74 × 10–3 M stock
solution of NO was prepared by a previously reported method46 in deoxygenated deionized water. The •OH, ONOO–, and HNO solutions were prepared by reported
methods.43 The 1.0 × 10–3 M stock solutions of TNP and other nitroaromatics were prepared
in 8:2 (v/v) water and CH3CN. The solutions of different
anions and metal cations were prepared in H2O. The probe
PyDA-NP (10 μM) was taken in 2.5 mL of CH3CN with
5% water in a cuvette, to which NO+ or NO was added incrementally
from 0 to 80 μM, and UV–vis and fluorescence spectra
were recorded.

Calculation of Limit of Detection (LOD)
The detection
limit (LOD) of NO and NO+ has been calculated by the 3σ
method.  From the plot of FI versus [PyDA-NP], standard
deviation (Sd) of the intercept was obtained,
and slope S was obtained from the fluorescence titration
of PyDA-NP with NO/NO+ and taking the linear part of FI
versus [NO/NO+] plots.

Quantum Yield (Φ)
Calculation
Fluorescence quantum
yields (Φ) were calculated by the equation  where Asample and Astd are the areas of fluorescence spectral curves
of the sample and standard, respectively, at the excitation wavelength
and ODsample and ODstd are the respective optical
densities. The standard aqueous acidic quinine sulfate solution (Φstd = 0.54) was used for measuring the quantum yields of PyDA-NP,
PyDA-NP + NO+, and different ratios of binary mixture (v/v)
H2O/CH3CN systems.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Analyses
The crystallinity of the deposited materials on
mica foils by the drop-cast method was examined by the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) technique using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with
a Bragg–Brentano goniometer geometry and Cu Kα X-radiation
source (λ = 1.5418 Å). Morphological analyses were carried
out by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (JEOL,
JSM-6700F) and TEM (JEOL JEM 2100F) with an acceleration voltage of
200 kV. For TEM analysis, the samples were prepared in 10–3 M range, drop-cast on a copper grid, and then allowed to vacuum-dry
overnight. The extent of aggregation of Py-DANP has been studied with
a DLS (Particle Size Analyzer-Zetasizer 1000 HS, U.K.) experiment.

CuI (0.38 g, 2 mmol) was added to act as a catalyst. The reaction
mixture was stirred for 6 h under reflux, then cooled down to room
temperature, and poured into cold saturated brine solution. The precipitate
thus formed was filtered and dried to afford 2.3 g (12.7 mmol, 63%)

Results and Discussion
Optical Sensing Properties
The photophysical
properties
of PyDA-NP were investigated with absorption and fluorescence studies.
The free PyDA-NP shows a weak emission at 430 nm on excitation at
390 nm in CH3CN. It is quite astounding to ascertain that
PyDA-NP shows an aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effect
when the volume percentage of water is increased up to 80% in the
binary solvent mixture (H2O/CH3CN). Moreover,
another quite surprising finding is that PyDA-NP exhibits highly selective
and sensitive recognition toward NO in CH3CN containing
5% water.

Spectral Response of PyDA-NP to NO
The UV–vis
spectrum of sensor PyDA-NP was recorded in 5% water in CH3CN, which displayed well-defined bands at 242, 276, 284, 342, 360,
370, and 389 nm. On gradual addition of NO+, there is a
decrease in absorbance at 242, 276, and 284 nm along with the development
of new bands at 243, 309, and 448 nm, with isosbestic points at 237,
253, 289, and 322 nm (Figure 1). This indicates an electrophilic substitution of H+ by NO+ at the NH nitrogen atom, which is confirmed by
FT-IR, HRMS, and 1H NMR studies (vide infra). A plot of
absorbance (at 448 nm) versus [NO+] gives a nonlinear curve
of decreasing slope, which yields Kd =
(6.47 ± 0.51) × 10–6 M by a nonlinear
computer-fit program (Figure 1, inset).

of absorbance vs [NO+].

In 5% water–CH3CN, the PyDA-NP probe is
highly sensitive
and selective toward NO+. A fluorescence titration was
carried out with a fixed concentration of PyDA-NP (10 μM) with
variable concentrations of NO+ (0–80.0 μM)
at 25 °C in 5% water–CH3CN. It was observed
that on gradual addition of NO+ a new emission band at
∼523 nm was developed on excitation at 390 nm (Figure 2).

in concentration of NO+ from 0 to 80 μM at 25 °C
in 5% water–CH3CN. (b) Plot of FI vs [NO+]. (c) UV-exposed photograph.

A FI versus [NO+] plot gives a nonlinear curve,
which
was fitted by a nonlinear computer-fit program to give Kd = (16.8 ± 1.3) × 10–6 M.
It is interesting to note that there is a reasonable agreement between
the Kd values obtained from two different
spectroscopic titrations.

We also performed the titration of
PyDA-NP with a standard saturated stock solution of NO (1.74 ×
10–3 M) in pure water. It is interesting to observe
that
a new emission band appears at ∼523 nm with the increase in
the concentration of NO (0–14.0) μM (Figure 3a) with the probe in 5% aqueous
CH3CN. However, when the NO concentration is increased
beyond 14 μM, the emission peak at ∼523 nm decreases
gradually and a new emission band at ∼445 nm builds up with
a bathochromic shift. This interesting photophysical property is attributed
to the fact that on increasing the concentration of NO up to 14 μM
(6% water content), the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) mechanism
(Scheme 3) is operative,
showing the emission band at ∼523 nm, but on further increase
in the concentration of NO beyond 14 μM, the water content of
the resulting solution gradually increases (16% or more water content).
As a result, aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE) of PyDA-NP
dominates over the ICT mechanism and thus an emission band at ∼445
nm builds up (vide infra). As AIEE is more effective than the ICT
process at a comparatively higher water content, the emission peak
at 523 nm is decreased and the peak at 445 nm builds up gradually
beyond 14 μM NO (Figure 3b).

μM). (d) Plot of FI vs [NO] at λem = 445 and

Scheme 3 Mechanism of NO/NO+ Ion
Detection
Mechanism of NO Sensing
The PyDA-NP probe reacts with
NO in the presence of O2 through the formation of intermediate
N2O3, which acts as a source of NO+ (N2O3 → NO+ + NO2–) to give N-nitroso amine.43 On the other hand, NO+ (NO+BF4–) in CH3CN also directly
reacts with PyDA-NP to give deep yellow N-nitrosamine.
The pure product thus obtained was analyzed
by the 1H NMR (Figure S7), HRMS
(Figure S8), and FT-IR studies (Figure S9). From the FT-IR study, PyDA-NP showed
the absorption band at 3363 cm–1 corresponding to
the −NH stretching frequency (Figure S9). However, for the product formed after the reaction between PyDA-NP
and NO or NO+, the −NH stretching frequency vanishes
and a new absorption band appears at 1411 cm–1 corresponding
to the −N=O stretching frequency of nitrosamine47 (Figure S9b). Again,
the 1H NMR study reveals that −NH peaks of PyDA-NP
at 7.48 ppm vanish to base line on reaction with NO+, indicating
the fact that NO+ attacks on the −NH group to give
the −N–N=O moiety (Figure S7). The observation of ESI-MS+ peak at 486.1884
(PyDA-NP + NO + Na+ + CH3CN) clearly suggested
the formation of the −N–N=O group (Figure S8). To account for the observed sensing
of NO or NO+ ion by PyDA-NP, an intramolecular charge-transfer
(ICT) mechanism (Scheme 3) was invoked. Due to the formation of −N–N=O,
an electron-withdrawing moiety, as well as the presence of an electron-withdrawing
group −NO2 on the benzene ring, leads to an enhanced
ICT emission as indicated by a large red shift of 93 nm (peak shifted
from 430 to 523 nm).

Selectivity
Exclusivity in the detection
of analyte
is imperative for a real-time sensor system. Thus, the selectivity
of the probe (10 μM) toward NO/NO+ is confirmed by
reacting with various reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen
species (RNS) such as •OH, H2O2, O2–, NO3–, ONOO–, NO2–, DEA-NONOate,
NO, NO+, TEMPO radical, ascorbic acid (AA), and dehydroascorbic
acid (DHA) in 70 μM concentration. As shown in Figure 4, the fluorescence behavior
of PyDA-NP showed almost negligible changes after the addition of
ROS/RNS, except for DEA-NONOate, NO, and NO+. The detection
of NO is not interfered by various inorganic anions (Figure S10) and cations also (Figure S11).

Figure 4 Bar plot for fluorescence signals of PyDA-NP at 523 nm (λex = 390 nm) toward different biological anions in 5% water–CH3CN. PyDA-NP = 10 μM, Xn– = 80 μM.

Quantum Yield (Φ) and Detection Limit (LOD)
Using
quinine sulfate as a standard, the quantum yield (Φ) of PyDA-NP–NO
becomes 0.107, whereas for the free ligand, Φ = 0.00118. To
calculate the LOD of NO and NO+, the 3σ method was
adopted, and it was found to be 2.13/0.307 pM, respectively (Figure S12), which seems to be the lowest LOD
of the so far reported probes. From all of the results presented above,
it is clear that PyDA-NP is an ideal chemosensor for the detection
of NO+ or NO.

Aggregation-Induced Emission
It
is well known that
a fluorophore may undergo aggregation naturally. It will be exciting
when aggregation leads to an increase in emission of a fluorophore
by a positive role instead of a negative.48 During the solvent selection process for sensory property, we found
that our probe PyDA-NP is freely soluble in CH3CN. UV–vis
absorption of PyDA-NP in CH3CN solution shows prominent
peaks at 343, 360, 370, and 388 nm, which may be originated from the
π–π* transition of the monomeric form of pyrene
chromophore. Upon incremental addition of the water fraction (fw) from 0 to 80% to PyDA-NP in CH3CN, the UV peak at 358 nm is decreased and the peak at 388 nm is
red-shifted toward the isosbestic point at 396 nm (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Absorption titration
of PyDA-NP (10 μM) with the increase
in % of water in CH3CN.

From the fluorescence spectra, with the increase in % of
water
content in CH3CN, a gradual enhancement of emission intensity
with 20 nm red shift from 447 to 467 nm (Figure 6a) was observed, reaching a maximum at 80%
of water content. This bathochromic shift in the emission band arises
due to J-type aggregation through a face-to-face packing between the
monomers.49 This clearly indicates that
the PyDA-NP molecule is AIEE-active. This aggregation-induced enhanced
emission of PyDA-NP could be due to high rigidity of the probe in
the aggregated state causing restriction of RIR and/or RIV. Again,
a noticeable color change is observed from colorless to cyan under
UV light illumination upon addition of different % of water (Figure 6c). A plot of FI
as a function of water % shows a steady increase in FI with the increase
in water %, reaches a maximum at 80% water (Figure 6b), and then decreases on further increase
in water %. This indicates that aggregation maximizes at 80% water
content; however, on a further increase in water content, the aggregates
get ruptured.

Time Course of Fluorescence
Response
To gain deep insight
into fluorescence enhancement, time-dependent studies have been performed
on the nanoaggregates of PyDA-NP. In the presence of 40% water content
in CH3CN, the fluorescence intensity becomes almost saturated
after ∼15 min. This indicates that the aggregation process
is rather fast
(Figure 7).

fluorescence spectral changes of PyDA-NP (10
μM) in 40% water content CH3CN (λex = 390 nm) (each measurement performed at an equal span of 50 s).
(b) Relative changes in fluorescence intensity of PyDA-NP, as a function
of time (0–17 min).

FESEM, TEM, and DLS Studies
To establish a nanolevel
aggregation of the ligand (PyDA-NP) during AIEE studies, FESEM, TEM,
DLS, and XRD studies were performed. Structural and morphological
changes with respect to (w.r.t.) water dilutions from 0 to 100% were
noticed. Also, an unusual change was observed during treatment with
NO+. The surface morphology of PyDA-NP after different
treatments has been analyzed by FESEM. Here, Figure 8 reveal that (a) the ligand in pure CH3CN (0% water) shows trigonal crystallites with a grain size
of ∼90 nm, (b) the ligand in the presence of 80% water shows
cubical crystallites with a grain size of ∼65 nm, and also,
(c) the ligand in the presence of NO+ in 5% water–CH3CN shows spherical crystallites with a grain size of ∼70
nm at room temperature; the corresponding magnified crystallites are
shown in the inset of the Figure 8. The changes in their surface morphologies (in the
same scale bars i.e., 3 μm) were responsible for the enhanced
emission, which directly influence the impressive coloration behavior
of the hydrosol, supported with optical studies (vide infra). From
the TEM analysis (Figure 9), the scattered nanocrystals of Schiff base (a) PyDA-NP in
CH3CN at a 100 nm scale bar
indicates that the small crystallites are well dispersed. On the other
hand, (b) PyDA-NP at 80% (water–CH3CN) shows the
smaller crystallites to form distorted cubical grains and (c) PyDA-NP
+ NO+ (80 μM) in 5% (water–CH3CN)
denotes spherical grains (Figure 9) having 10–15 nm crystallites size in 20 nm
scale bars, respectively. The corresponding lattice fringes of three
distinct samples PyDA-NP in CH3CN, PyDA-NP in 80% water–CH3CN, and PyDA-NP + NO+ (80 μM) in 5% water–CH3CN are encircled in yellow in Figure 9 and are shown in (d) 100 nm, (e)
5 nm, and (f) 5 nm scale bars, respectively. The density of lattice
fringes and their orientations are completely different from each
other due to their own space filling nature exerted by the incumbent
interactions. From TEM analyses, it has
been noticed that the shape of the small crystallites is almost the
same as the surface
topography in different conditions. It was also suggested that the
aggregation-driven growth is one of the reasons for emission enhancement.
The agglomeration tendency of PyDA-NP in 5% water–CH3CN on NO+ charging is shown to be the predominating reason
for the ICT process of sensing.

corresponding magnified crystallites are shown.

in 5% water–CH3CN; (d–f) the
corresponding atomic fringes of three different samples are encircled.

Particle size determination of
the prepared PyDA-NP hydrosol was
performed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements with successively
increasing dilution of the stock solution by deionized water. The
average diameters of the particles ∼38, ∼171, ∼455,
and ∼341 nm have been observed after each dilution with 0,
30, 80, and 100% water content in binary (water–CH3CN) mixtures followed by ultrasonication for 15 min, respectively
(Figure 10). With
the increase in water fractions from 80 to 100% the average diameter
of the particle starts decreasing from ∼455 to ∼341
nm, which can be attributed to the change in the nature of agglomerated
structure; the solubility or dispersion of the agglomerated adduct
of the pyrene system is much more affected in 100% water medium. It
is to be expected that the maximum number of excimers reside together
at 80% water fraction. The number of fluorogenic groups is progressively
decreasing with the increase of dilution (80–100%); therefore,
grain distributions are also affected, which directly influence the
AIEE behavior. The change in the agglomerated structure in aqueous
medium with water dilution
indicates their high surface reactivities, with the adjacent moieties
thereby showing the bulky nature of the particle. Therefore, we assume
that with dilution the surface topology as well as their reactive
sites altogether changes, which influences the emission process. Again,
the size of the aggregates is reduced with an increase in water content,
resulting in a dramatic decrease in the emission intensity examined
through different optical and structural analyses.

particle size diameter with increasing % of water content in CH3CN solution: (a) 0% water, (b) 30% water, (c) 80% water, and
(d) 100% water.

XRD Analysis
From
XRD analysis, it has been confirmed
that the size of the crystallites gradually increases because of water
dilutions effects. The diffraction patterns are almost the same, but
for the PyDA-NP in 100% water, the intensity of the peaks gradually
decreases (Figure S13), indicating the
fact that agglomeration is no longer taking place. It has been noticed
that peak broadening takes place with an increase in the % of water
dilution and maximum peak broadening has been observed at 80% water
dilution due to the changes in chemical environments, as evidenced
from their magnification as well as lower same scale bar fitting images
(Figure 11).

μM) in CH3CN; PyDA-NP (10 μM) in 30, 80, and
100% water–CH3CN; and NO+ (80 μM)
in 5% water–CH3CN.

The Debye–Scherrer equation,50D = 0.9 × λ/β cos θ
(where D is the crystallite size, λ = 1.5418
Å, β is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and θ
is the half of the diffraction angle in radian), was applied to determine
the crystallite size of the deposited films by the drop-cast method
on different cleaned mica foils. The values of the dislocation density
(δ), which gives the number of defects in the materials, were
calculated from the average values of the crystallite size D by the relationship51 δ
= 1/D2 and found to be significantly low,
on the order of 10–4/nm2. A comparison
between the FWHM, crystallite size (D), and dislocation
density (δ) at different peaks of hybrid PyDA-NP films under
different reaction conditions is shown in Table S1. The Debye–Scherrer grain size and dislocation density
clearly indicate that the bare ligand PyDA-NP and its dilution in
a binary mixture (water–CH3CN) in the range of 30–80%,
with NO+ in 5% water, are altogether different from 100%
water-treated PyDA-NP. Thus, X-ray analysis also supports the change
in crystallinity nature w.r.t. dilution which may directly influence
the emission process of optical properties.

Optical Fluorescence Microscopy
Studies
The aggregation
of PyDA-NP in the presence of water can be well established with the
help of solid-state luminescence studies by optical microscopy. Moreover,
upon UV excitation, PyDA-NP does not show any emission, but with 80%
water content in CH3CN, the PyDA-NP shows strong green
emission. Again, in a 5% water–CH3CN binary mixture,
the solution of PyDA-NP (10 μM) and NO+ (80 μM)
displays orange emission (Figure 12). This is a beautiful illustration of an optical waveguide
effect operating in a light transmission process within the nanocrystals.
The responsive behavior toward light depends upon the number of excitons
in different wavelengths of UV radiation. Thus, the luminescence behavior
in the solid state is attributed to the fabrication of organic light-emitting
diode as a suitable material.12,48

water–CH3CN, and (c) PyDA-NP + NO+ (80
μM) in 5 % water–CH3CN with UV light excitation
(scale bar = 50 μm).

TCSPC Studies
The time-resolved single-photon counting
(TCSPC) measurements were used to reveal the nature of different light-emitting
species. This measurement is more robust than the measurement of fluorescence
intensity because it does not depend on the excitation intensity or
the concentration of the fluorophore. With the increase in % of water
in the binary mixture, the lifetime of PyDA-NP also increases (Table S2). As shown in Figures 13 and S14, the
fluorescence decay profile of PyDA-NP with 0, 30, 80, and 100% water–CH3CN solution is well fitted with biexponential decay.

Figure 13 Time-resolved
fluorescence decay of PyDA-NP in CH3CN
and in the presence of 30 and 80% water content binary mixture (water–CH3CN) solution at room temperature.

As revealed previously, the J-type aggregation of PyDA-NP
has been
proposed from the bathochromic shift of absorption and emission bands.
AIEE behavior of PyDA-NP was further investigated by measuring the
fluorescence quantum yield (Φ) as a function of fw (0–100%), shown in Figure S15 and Table S2. The fluorescence quantum yield of PyDA-NP
(Φ = 0.00118) in pure CH3CN is also enhanced 833-fold
(Φ = 0.79) in the presence of 80% water content in CH3CN. A further increase in water % decreases Φ, for the same
reason as discussed earlier. All of these results are consistent with
the photophysical properties of reported J-type aggregates.52−54

We have also calculated the radiative (kr) and nonradiative (knr) rate
constants
of PyDA-NP at different water % using the following equations  where Φf is the quantum yield
and τ is the lifetime. This clearly showed that kr increases significantly with an increase in the % of
water, whereas knr decreases to some extent.
All of these photophysical parameters are listed in Table S2.

The fascinating AIEE effects of the probe,
PyDA-NP, lead us to
explore its potential applications as a chemosensor for nitroaromatics
such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), 4-nitrophenol
(4-NP), m-dinitrobenzene (DNB), p-choloronitrobenzene (Cl-NB), 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (DNBA), and
4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA). Among the different aromatic nitroexplosives,
only TNP showed selective reduction of the fluorescence intensity
of the aggregated (excimer) fluorophore up to 97% (Figure 14). We also performed overselectivity
for the detection of TNP (Figure S16),
where the fluorescence intensity is fully quenched only in the presence
of TNP.

Figure 14 Quenching efficiency (%) of the excimer fluorescence (at λem = 467 nm with λex = 390 nm) of PyDA-NP
(10 μM) in 8:2 H2O/CH3CN upon addition
of different nitroexplosives.

It was observed that on addition of TNP (0–250 μM)
to the solution of PyDA-NP in 8:2 H2O/CH3CN
(Figure 15) the fluorescence
intensity gradually decreases. To determine the quenching constant
of PyDA-NP by TNP, the fluorescence intensity ratio (I0/I) was plotted against the concentration
of TNP, yielding a nonlinear curve (Figure 16), and was solved by adopting an exponential
quenching Stern–Volmer (SV) equation, I0/I = A ek[Q] + B.55 From this equation, the calculated quenching constant becomes (1.4
± 0.02) × 104 M–1. The value
of quenching constant is high enough to indicate the superquenching
ability of TNP toward PyDA-NP.

and (iii) upon addition of TNP in the aggregated state under a UV
lamp (365 nm).

Figure 16 Plot of I0/I against
the concentration of TNP.

The nonlinear nature of the Stern–Volmer (SV) plot
of TNP
(Figure 16) can be
ascribed to the self-absorption or an energy transfer process. It
is pointed out here that the linear deviation of the SV plot indicates
the combination of static and dynamic quenching or that the extent
of quenching is high at a higher concentration of TNP. The fluorescence
lifetime measurement of the sensor in the presence and absence of
the quencher (TNP) is the best way to understand the involvement of
either dynamic or static mechanism in the quenching process. The static
quenching arises due to the binding of the sensor with the quencher
in the ground state, forming a nonfluorescent complex in the “dark
state”, and the unbound molecules exhibit their inherent lifetimes.
However, for dynamic quenching, the fluorescence lifetime of the sensor
decreases via diffusion-controlled collisions between the excited
sensor and the quencher. As shown in Figure S17, the fluorescence lifetime of PyDA-NP in 80% water content (water–CH3CN) remains unchanged in the presence of different concentrations
(80 and 240 μM) of TNP (Table S3),
which shows that fluorescence quenching of the aggregated state occurs
by TNP through a static mechanism. Thus, the only reason for the upward
deviation
of the SV plot (Figure 16) is the superquenching ability of TNP at a higher concentration.

We also studied the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the PyDA-NP
(10 μM) in the AIEE state (80% water) in the presence of TNP.
Interestingly, on addition of TNP (250 μM), a new absorption
band (a shoulder) appears at 430 nm, which may arise due to the strong
interaction between the electron-deficient TNP and π-electron-rich
aromatic fluorophores, leading to the formation of a charge-transfer
(CT) complex56,57 (Figure S18). The spectral changes are also accompanied with a drastic color
change from almost colorless to light yellow (i → ii) (Figure 15c), visible to
the naked eyes. Thus, the sensing of TNP is associated with the intercalation
of the nitroaromatic compounds between two pyrene rings held together
by π–π stacking interactions in the aggregated
state, leading to a CT process from pyrene to the analyte (TNP).

In addition to solution phase detection, we have also performed
contact-mode analysis of TNP, which is particularly useful in the
field of analytical and forensic sciences. Therefore, we have prepared
test paper strips by dip-coating a solution of PyDA-NP (10 μM)
in 80% water in CH3CN onto a Whatman 40 filter paper. After
that, the paper strip was dipped in 1 mM solution of TNP, which showed
an immediate color change from colorless to light yellow (a →
c) visible to the naked eye (Figure 17). The instantaneous cyan blue fluorescence quenching
(b → d) was observed under a UV lamp (365 nm).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized
a pyrene-based
fluorescent probe, which displays dual emission; green fluorescence
emission (∼523 nm) for nitric oxide due to the ICT process
and aggregation-induced enhancement emission (AIEE) in the blue region
(∼467 nm) for the formation of a pyrene excimer complex. The
high selectivity and sensitivity of the novel probe PyDA-NP toward
nitric oxide could be achieved by the N-nitrosation mechanism. The
AIEE property of the novel probe was well established from UV–vis,
fluorescence, DLS, SEM, TEM, XRD, optical fluorescence microscopy,
and time-resolved photoluminescence studies. In the H2O/CH3CN binary mixture (8:2 v/v), the probe showed maximum aggregation
with extensive (833-fold) increases in fluorescence intensity and
high quantum yield (Φ = 0.79). The fascinating AIEE effects
of PyDA-NP lead us to explore its potential applications as a chemosensor
for the selective recognition of trinitrophenol (TNP). In addition,
we have also performed contact-mode analysis for the detection of
TNP, which is specifically used in the field of analytical and forensic
sciences. Therefore, we strongly believe that this non-dye-based PyDA-NP
molecule is a superior multifunctional material, which shows selective
sensing of NO (λem = 523 nm), AIEE behavior (λem = 476 nm), and selective detection of nitroexplosive TNP.
