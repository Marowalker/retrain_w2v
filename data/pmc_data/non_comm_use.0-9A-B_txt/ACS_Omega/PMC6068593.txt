Commercial
humic acids mainly obtained from leonardite are in increasing
demand in agronomy, and their market size is growing rapidly because
these materials act as soil conditioners and direct stimulators of
plant growth and development. In nature, fungus-driven nonspecific
oxidations are believed to be a key to catabolizing recalcitrant plant
lignins, resulting in lignin humification. Here we demonstrated the
effective transformation of technical lignins derived from the Kraft
processing of woody biomass into humic-like plant fertilizers through
one-pot Fenton oxidations (i.e., artificially accelerated fungus reactions).
The lignin variants resulting from the Fenton reaction, and manufactured
using a few different ratios of FeSO4 to H2O2, successfully accelerated the germination of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and increased the tolerance
of this plant to NaCl-induced abiotic stress; moreover, the extent
of the stimulation of the growth of this plant by these manufactured
lignin variants was comparable or superior to that induced by commercial
humic acids. The results of high-resolution (15 T) Fourier transform-ion
cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, electrostatic force microscopy,
Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analyses strongly
indicated that oxygen-based functional groups were incorporated into
the lignins. Moreover, analyses of the total phenolic contents of
the lignins and their sedimentation kinetics in water media together
with scanning electron microscopy- and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller-based
surface characterizations further suggested that polymer fragmentation
followed by modification of the phenolic groups on the lignin surfaces
was crucial for the humic-like activity of the lignins. A high similarity
between the lignin variants and commercial humic acids also resulted
from autonomous deposition of iron species into lignin particles during
the Fenton oxidation, although their short-term effects of plant stimulations
were maintained whether the iron species were present or absent. Finally,
we showed that lignins produced from an industrial-scale acid-induced
hydrolysis of wood chips were transformed with the similar enhancements
of the plant effects, indicating that our fungus-mimicking processes
could be a universal way for achieving effective lignin humification.

Introduction
The continual misuse
of NPK-based fertilizers has increased the
need to develop and use sustainable and ecofriendly materials for
increasing soil fertility and hence enhancing crop productivity.1 Humic substances (HSs), which are mainly derived
from the decay of plant tissues, are known to stimulate plant growth
and development in a multifunctional way.2−4 In addition,
the capacity of high-molecular-weight HSs to immobilize inorganic
plant nutrients5 and to aggregate soil
particles6 suggests that they may serve
as excellent soil conditioners. Commercial HSs manufactured in bulk
are extracted from coal resources such as lignite and leonardite,
whereas natural humic materials are widespread in the environment.
The production and quality control of commercial HSs rely thus on
the distribution of coal, which is limited. To overcome this bottleneck,
developments of artificial humification pathways, in particular those
with ecofriendly materials, have been recently highlighted. For examples,
Savy et al. demonstrated that soluble fractions of technical lignins
exhibit a humic-like activity toward maize.7 Polymeric products obtained from oxidative polymerization of natural
phenols such as catechol and vanillic acid were proven to be effective
at stimulating Arabidopsis plants.8

Lignin and HSs have been suggested to be structurally
similar.8,9 Aromatic portions of HSs that persist in
the environment are believed
to be derived from lignin because lignins with multiple aromatic rings
supplied from plant biomass tend to be recalcitrant compounds against
most microbes.9 Fungi, however, have been
shown to actively oxidize lignin under aerobic conditions,10 presumably resulting in the transformations
of its aromatic architectures. Although a detailed relationship between
humification and microbe-driven metabolism of lignin has not yet been
demonstrated, some reports have suggested that fungal metabolism with
lignin-related biomaterials can contribute to humification.11,12 Nonspecific oxidations resulting from Fenton chemistry and ligninolytic
enzymes are mainly involved in the biotic transformation of lignin
due to the structural diversity and three-dimensional structure of
lignin.10 Through these reactions, lignin
fragmentation concomitant with addition of oxygen-based functional
groups occurs,13 and it is not unreasonable
to suggest that such structural changes give rise to the enhancement
of the cationic exchange capacity of HSs, which is one of their main
beneficial characteristics.14 In addition,
phenols and carboxylic acids in aromatic polymers have been proven
to directly stimulate plants, indicating that oxygen incorporation
leading to the formation of such hydrophilic functional groups allows
lignins to directly boost the stimulation of plant growth and development.8

Production of technical lignins from woody
biomass has been increasing
steadily due to the industrialization of cellulose-based fermentation
as well as due to the traditional pulp industry.15 Effective valorization strategies for lignins are thus
required to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the biomass refinery.
Toward this end, some methods have been introduced to isolate humic-like
molecules from lignin biomass; note that such methods are also important
because humic-like molecules are applicable to crop production and
alternative to commercial humic substances.7,16,17 However, their plant-stimulation action
relies heavily on their high water solubility, suggesting that low-molecular-weight
lignin-derived phenolics exhibiting strong phytotoxicity8,18 become mixed with each other during the separation processes. Moreover,
little attention has been paid to the inorganic portion of humic materials
despite humic–Fe complexes being readily identifiable in the
environment19 and lignite, one of the major
coal sources for commercial humic acids (HAs), also containing significant
amounts of iron.20 It is thus not unreasonable
to suggest that humic substances showing hydroxyphenyl groups persist
as organic–Fe complexes in the environment. Several biomolecules
containing polyphenolic chains (i.e., the structures readily found
in HSs) have been shown to recruit Fe ions to modulate their physicochemical
and biological functionalities through the formation of polyphenol–Fe
complexes21,22 and Fe uptake, which is essential for healthy
plant growth, has been shown to be significantly affected by the presence
of organic matter in soils.23 These results
strongly indicated that the Fe-associated inorganic portion of humic
acids must be considered for optimizing artificial humification of
plant materials.

The aim of this study was to develop a novel
ecofriendly methodology
for effective humification of technical lignins that are used in Kraft
and sugar fermentation processes. A Fenton-based one-pot advanced
oxidation was employed not only to mimic fungus-driven lignin humification,
but also to induce the formation of Fe-based complexes with lignin
variants. Several analytical tools including a scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), measurements of specific surface area, high-resolution Fourier
transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), sedimentation
kinetics, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electrostatic force
microscopy (EFM), element analysis, determination of phenol contents,
Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and inductively coupled
plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) were used to compare
the variants with commercial humic acids with respect to both their
organic and inorganic structures and to decipher structural aspects
key for driving humic-like fertilization. Plant-stimulation activities
of lignins before and after Fenton oxidations were evaluated by using Arabidopsis plants.

Results and Discussion
Fenton-Induced Changes
in Kraft Lignin Structures
Kraft
lignins have been produced as a byproduct in pulp industries, but
their applicability has not yet been extended to agronomy.24 To induce an accelerated humification, Fenton
agents were mixed with Kraft lignin particles. Because the reactions
were based on water matrices, lignins were partitioned into two phases
(i.e., water-soluble and water-insoluble phases). Here, we employed
Fenton lignin variants belonging to the water-insoluble phases for
further experiments because low-molecular-weight phenolics derived
from Fenton-based lignin depolymerization are known to exhibit strong
phytotoxicity.25,26 The insoluble portion was harvested
through the same centrifugal force with both Fenton-treated and nontreated
samples, thus assuring that lignin-related molecules showing similar
solubility were collected (see Materials and Methods). The collected particles after freeze-drying were colloidally dispersed
in distilled water as did commercial Sigma humic acids.

The
intensity of broad peaks ranging from 3200 to 3400 cm–1 clearly increased in the IR spectra of the samples subjected to
Fenton oxidations (Figure 1A). The peak positions corresponded to the O–H of the
phenolic groups. In addition, the intensities of the peaks in the
vicinity of 1705 cm–1 corresponding to C=O
of the carboxylic acids increased with increasing concentration of
Fe2+, suggesting that carboxylic acids were incorporated
into the lignin particles (Figure 1C). To observe the morphological changes in lignin
particles, the lyophilized powders were visualized using SEM. As shown
in Figure 2A, globular
structures in Kraft lignins were frequently identified, but the structures
mostly appeared degraded, presumably due to the Fenton-based advanced
oxidations. The globular structures are also identifiable in supramolecular
structure of melanin involving π–π stacking.27 Several hydrophilic groups introduced through
Fenton oxidation would facilitate the disassembly of π–π
stacking, thus making the polymeric architecture much irregular. In
addition, other factors such as polymer length and metal chelating
would be involved in the destruction of the globular structures. Such
a morphological change would link to a change in the surface areas
of the lignin powders. As shown in Table 1, the Fenton reactions were observed to yield
significant increases in the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of the lignin particles. This increase would be
also attributable to the physical opening of a tightly packed π–π
stacking. The significant increases in the total phenolic contents
derived from particle surfaces of the lignin variants (Figure 2B) suggest that the particle
fragmentation leading to the increases in the BET surface areas is
initiated with phenol-based surface modifications. It is also noticeable
that the total phenolic contents could be achieved, similar to that
of commercial humic acids (Figure 2B). However, unexpectedly, their ζ-potential
values were slightly decreased, although the IR peaks suggested that
the Fenton reactions resulted in the lignin surfaces becoming modified
with oxygen-based functional groups. Moreover, the hydrodynamic sizes
of some of the Fenton samples were greater than those of the untreated
lignins (Table 1).
This result was in contrast to changes in the particle morphologies
and the surface areas. Both ζ-potential values and hydrodynamic
sizes were measured in aqueous media and indicated that water molecules
were actively incorporated into macro-organic components of the lignin
powders. In addition, iron-related inorganics capable of being cross-linked
with lignins after Fenton treatments were expected to affect the extent
of lignin coagulations. Coordination of metals with lignin architecture
has been shown to coincide with physical coagulation.28

Clear evidence for the incorporation of oxygen into the lignins
was also provided by elemental and ultrahigh-resolution (15 T) electrospray
ionization (ESI) (−) FT-ICR MS analyses. The relative amount
of oxygen in the lignins increased as a result of the Fenton reactions,
whereas those of carbon and nitrogen decreased, suggesting that bleaching
of the pre-existing organics and addition of oxygen-based functional
groups occurred simultaneously (Table 2). The total number of ions detected in the negative
ESI mode dramatically increased as a result of the Fenton oxidations
(Table 3). This ESI
result was attributed to the presence of oxygen-based functional groups,
which were readily transformed into negative dipoles and ions. Furthermore,
based on the molecular assignments of the detected m/z values, we were able to decipher in detail the
structural modifications of the lignin components that resulted from
the Fenton reactions (Figure 3). First, the relative number of molecules showing high O/C
ratios increased, and this result was comparable with the IR peaks
supporting oxygen incorporation. Second, the relative number of molecules
showing high H/C ratios (i.e., lipid-like molecules) also increased.
Similarly, molecular distribution with respect to double-bond equivalents
(DBEs) showed that the DBE values for carbon numbers at about 20 decreased
during the course of the Fenton reactions, suggesting that aromatic
portions of lignins became saturated (Figure 4). Fenton-based oxidations have been shown
to facilitate benzene-ring openings and the resulting formation of
aliphatic structures.29 Solid-state NMR
analyses have clearly demonstrated heterogeneous mixtures of aromatic
and aliphatic groups to constitute one of the key structural features
of commercial humic acids.8 Thus, the use
of Fenton-based oxidations of lignin powders would be a scalable way
to effectively transform aromatic lignins into humic-like structures
containing aliphatic groups. This method also overcame our previous
humification method,8 which hardly generated
aliphatic structures.

To characterize the electrostatic interactions occurring on the
lignin surfaces, EFM scanning was employed. As shown in Figure 5, the electrostatic roughness
was directly proportional to the amount of ferrous ions used for the
Fenton reactions. This direct proportionality may have resulted from
(i) the addition of oxygen-based hydrophilic groups to lignin surfaces
or (ii) with the presence of iron-related inorganics deposited in
lignin during Fenton reactions. The formation of iron oxides during
Fenton reactions for pollutant degradation has been well characterized.30 Fenton reactions with lignins would thus also
be expected to lead to the formation of the oxides. We hypothesized
that polyphenolic structures in lignins would recruit the oxides by
chelating them, thus retaining them during water-based washing (see Materials and Methods). To test this hypothesis,
ICP-OES analyses were performed before and
after Fenton oxidations. As shown in Figure 6, much higher amounts of iron-related inorganics
were observed in the Fenton-based lignin variants than in the untreated
lignins. Interestingly, the iron content in some commercial humic
acids manufactured in different countries was also much higher than
the iron content in untreated lignins. These results strongly indicated
that Fenton-based modifications resulted in lignins displaying inorganic
as well as organic structural features. In addition, our results indicated
the potential commercial benefit of using inorganic compounds in humic
acids to stimulate the growth of plants. In fact, iron belongs to
one of the essential elements for plant growth and development.31

The EPR spectra we obtained for the lignin and Fenton variants
showed similar g values of about 2.00, and this result
suggested that the lignin and Fenton variants contained significant
amounts of semiquinone-type free radicals (Table 4 and Figure 7A). In fact, such types of radicals are readily identifiable
in lignins.32 Overall, the peak-to-peak
signals decreased as the concentration of Fe2+ used to
treat lignin particles was increased. This kind of signal reduction
was consistent with the previous results showing the chelation of
metal by polydopamine, the similar polyaromatics.33 The deposition of iron oxide into lignin matrices during
Fenton oxidations was thus hypothesized to lead to a decrease in the
relative amount of semiquinone-type free radicals. We also studied
the sedimentation kinetics of the lignins to determine whether the
extent of supramolecular interaction of the lignin molecules under
water matrices was modified. As shown in Figure 7B, commercial humic acids sedimented at the
slowest rate. Much slower kinetics for the sedimentation in aqueous
solutions was observed for all of the Fenton variants than for the
untreated lignin. Interestingly, the specific mass ratio of FeSO4 and H2O2 (i.e., Kraft-0.5) for Fenton
oxidations exhibited kinetics similar to that of humic acids. These
patterns indicate that the hydrophobic region of lignin contributing
to self-aggregation was destroyed via Fenton-based nonspecific oxidation.

Solid-state 13C NMR spectra were acquired from the lignins
before and after being subjected to the Fenton oxidations, and the
carbon signals were clearly diminished as a result of the Fenton oxidations,
suggesting that the carbon–hydrogen located at the surfaces
of the particles were replaced with carbon–oxygen (Table 5). In addition, the
paramagnetic impurities derived from iron oxide deposition during
Fenton reactions would also contribute to the lower signals. According
to the ratios of the intensities of the aliphatic carbon to aromatic
carbon peaks,34 the aromaticity levels
of the samples subjected to Fenton-based modifications were slightly
less than those not subjected to oxidation. This result was consistent
with the other results including FT-ICR MS, IR, and sedimentation
(Figures 1, 3, and 7B). The Kraft lignin
transformation did not yield any significant changes in the intensities
or positions of the NMR peaks corresponding to the oxygen-based functional
and aliphatic groups (Figure S1). Note,
in this regard, that the oxygen-containing organics have been shown
to chelate metal oxides.35 The formation
of oxygen-based functional groups followed by their chelating of iron-based
inorganics would hinder the detection of carbon-based shifts using
NMR. Indeed, the chelation of ferric ions by lignins made 31P NMR-based structural elucidation not possible.25

Plant-Stimulation
Effects of Kraft Lignins and Their Fenton
Variants
The Kraft lignins were concluded, based on the above-described
results, to be oxygenated and then their polymers fragmented when
the Fenton-based modifications occurred. In addition, significant
amounts of iron-related species were shown to be deposited with lignin
particles, thus resembling commercial humic acids with respect to
inorganic sides. The commercial value of humic acids in agronomy lies
in their plant-stimulation activity. It has been reported several
times that the multifunctional effects of humic acids allow plants
to take up macroelements more efficiently, to increase their biomass
more quickly, and to endure abiotic stresses effectively.36−38 The extents of plant stimulations for Kraft lignins and their variants
must be thus examined to assess the effectiveness of our artificial
humification strategy. First, as lignin–iron complexes themselves,
variants of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings
were examined for their effects. Interestingly, specific conditions
used to produce the complexes (i.e., Kraft-0.5 and Kraft-1.0) induced
a faster germination than did those of untreated lignins and commercial
humic acids (Figure 8A). The rate of germination at these conditions increased with increasing
concentration of the variants treated (Figure 8A). Photographic images of A. thaliana showing longer radicles for the Fenton
variants were also consistent with the observed germination kinetics
(Figure 8B).

treated with 0.50 g of FeSO4·7H2O. The
control samples without any treatments and the samples treated with
humic acids were also used to compare the germination rates in Figure 12.

To determine the extents of any effects of iron
deposits derived
from the Fenton processes on plant stimulations, acid washing was
employed to remove the iron deposits from the lignin particles. The
ICP analyses indicated that acid washing resulted in a dramatic decrease
in the amount of iron (Figure 9). The washed lignin particles still induced accelerated A. thaliana germination, suggesting that the iron
particles hardly affected the germination process (Figure 10). However, the association
of iron species with humic acids was previously shown to be correlated
with plant growth.23,39 Different kinds of plant experiments
aimed at determining long-term effects of iron-related inorganics
are planned. In addition, experiments using this strategy and involving
the assessment of soil conditions where most crops are cultivated
are also planned because the dynamics of soil microorganisms affecting
plant growth can be modulated with iron, which is one of the ubiquitous
electron donors/acceptors.40 The physiological
effects of HSs on higher plants are multifunctional and several mechanisms
related with ion absorption, metabolism, and hormone-like activity
have been so far suggested to explain these effects.41 The capacity of the lignin variants to tolerate salt-induced
stress was also evaluated to determine whether the multifunctional
effects of humic acids on plants also occur. The chlorophyll contents
demonstrated that the Fenton-based transformation of lignins showed
a better plant-stimulation activity than did both untreated and commercial
humic acids (Figure 11). Our previous results strongly support that the salt tolerance
is associated with gene induction such as high-affinity K+ transporter 1 via humic-like polyphenolic structure.42 Detailed differences in the gene induction between
commercial humic acids and lignin variants should be assessed to fully
understand the exact molecular mechanisms.

Plant-Stimulation Effects of Acid Hydrolysis-Derived Lignins
and Their Fenton Variants
Recently, acid hydrolysis-based
fermentations of celluloses from woody biomass have been shown to
give rise to lignin byproducts. The detailed structures of lignins
are not easily determined because the materials are highly cross-linked
and coagulated. In addition, the detailed structures vary depending
on the sources of the lignins and methods used to extract them.43 Advanced oxidations including Fenton reactions
have been shown to induce nonspecific oxidations, strongly suggesting
that lignins can be transformed regardless of their structural diversity.29,30 To determine whether our strategy for lignin humification is universal,
lignins of a different type, specifically derived from acid hydrolysis
of woody biomass, were transformed using Fenton reactions. Here, the
extent of plant stimulations differed from those with Kraft lignins.
However, Fenton variants of the lignin from acid hydrolysis exhibited
a much more rapid germination than did both commercial humic acids
and the untreated lignin. A similar trend was also observed in the
cases of salt-induced abiotic stresses (Figure 12).

Figure 12 (A) Accelerated germination
rates and (B) salt stress-related chlorophyll
contents and related photographical images of A. thaliana in the presence of commercial humic acids, acid hydrolysis-related
lignins, and their Fenton variants (86 or 860 mg/L for the germination
and 860 mg/L for the salt stress). NaCl (250 mM) was treated to induce
salt-related abiotic stresses for the chlorophyll measurements. Data
are mean ± SE (n = 3). Significant differences
are shown as asterisks (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). Abbreviation: HA,
commercial humic acids; acid, untreated acid lignin; acid-0.1, lignin
treated with 0.05 g of FeSO4·7H2O; acid-0.5,
lignin treated with 0.25 g of FeSO4·7H2O; acid-0.7, lignin treated with 0.35 g of FeSO4·7H2O.

FT-ICR MS-based molecular
assignments of the lignins derived from
the acid treatment were also made, and the results indicated that
the overall distribution of their molecular compositions differs from
that of the Kraft lignins (Figure S2),
supporting the previous results regarding the structural diversity
of lignins.43 The atomic ratios derived
from these results corresponding to protein- and lipid-like molecules
showed the acid lignins to have a greater diversity of molecules than
did the Kraft lignins. Moreover, the lignins subjected to the Fenton
oxidations displayed higher O/C ratios than did the untreated lignins,
suggesting the occurrence of efficient oxygenations during the Fenton
reactions (Figure S2 and Table S1). Carbon
numbers with same the DBE values significantly decreased during the
course of the Fenton reactions (Figure S3). This pattern may have been due to the bond cleavage through the
Fenton-induced nonspecific oxidations. Morphological changes of the
acid lignins were similarly achieved with those of Kraft lignins (Figures 2A and S4). Efficacy of Fenton oxidation is known to
depend on the organic structures of oxidation targets.29 The similar humification results compared with
those of Kraft lignins suggest that key structural aspects of polyaromatics
for plant-stimulation are inducible with the overall control of amphiphilic
groups, especially oxygen-related functional groups. Further optimization
of the Fenton processes based on a response surface methodology is
planned to find the best ratio of hydrogen peroxide to iron(II) sulfate
for lignin humification.

Conclusions
Here, we designed a
scalable and lignin structure-independent strategy
to convert technical lignins into humic-like plant fertilizers using
Fenton-based advanced oxidations. Several analyses including FT-ICR
mass spectrometry, sedimentation, FT-IR, BET, determination of total
phenolic content, and elemental analysis showed that the oxygen groups
were incorporated into the lignin particles concomitant with polymer
fragmentation. Such changes in amphiphilic groups and aggregation
patterns led to accelerated rates of seed germination and the tolerance
of A. thaliana to salt-induced abiotic
stress. The extent of plant-stimulation here was comparable to that
of commercial humic acids, implying that the Fenton reaction for technical
lignin humification could be a promising lignin valorization strategy.
Interestingly, analytical tools such as ICP-OES and EFM suggested
iron-related inorganics to be widespread in commercial humic acids.
The Fenton reactions allowed lignin particles to mimic the inorganic
aspects of commercial humic acids because some of the oxidized iron-based
inorganics spontaneously deposited into the lignin matrices during
the Fenton reactions. Further tests of the long-term effects of iron-based
inorganics on plant stimulations are planned to confirm the necessity
of humic mimic–iron complexes.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
and Materials
Kraft lignin was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, whereas lignin from the acid-induced hydrolysis
of wood chips was kindly donated by the GS Caltex Corporation. The
acid lignin containing approximately 1% H2SO4 was directly used without further washing. Plant-stimulation tests
were based on A. thaliana wild-type
(Col-0 background) cultivated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium purchased
from Duchefa Biochemie. Iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate, humic acid,
and hydrogen peroxide (35%) were obtained from Junsei, Sigma-Aldrich,
and Duksan, respectively. Additional humic acids used in the ICP-OES
analyses for determining the Fe content originated from China and
the United States and were purchased from MR Innovation Corporation
(Daegu, Korea). Sulfuric acid and 60% perchloric acid were purchased
from Samchun Chemical and J. T. Baker, respectively. Both Folin and
Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent and gallic acid were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich.

Fenton Oxidation and Plant-Stimulation Tests
After
crushing Kraft and acid lignins with a mortar and pestle, a volume
of 20 mL of hydrogen peroxide (35%) was mixed with 1 g of each lignin
powder followed by stirring each of these two mixtures at 130 rpm
with a magnetic bar. Each of three different amounts of iron(II) sulfate
heptahydrate (i.e., 0.05, 0.25, or 0.50 g for Kraft lignins; 0.05,
0.25, or 0.35 g for acid hydrolysis-related lignins) were then added
to different samples of these stirred mixtures to initiate Fenton
reactions at room temperature. The ratios of hydrogen peroxide to
iron(II) sulfate were based on the previous study showing Fenton-based
oxidation of aromatics.29 A fifth of the
tested mass iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate completely dissolved in
5 mL of distilled water was injected every 10 min into the mixture.
Each oxidation reaction was terminated after 2 h by subjecting the
respective mixture to centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The pellets
were then washed two times with distilled water by repeated centrifugation
(3000 rpm for 15 min). The final powders for the plant experiments
were obtained by carrying out lyophilization. The lignin used as a
control was subjected to the same methods except that neither hydrogen
peroxide nor iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate was included as control.
Commercial Sigma humic acids were colloidally dispersed in distilled
water for further use.

Seed germination and NaCl-related salt
tolerance tests were based on the methodologies previously described.8 Briefly, the seeds were germinated on the MS
media, each of them containing commercial humic acids, lignin, and
lignin variants. Radicle and cotyledon emergence after 2 and 4 days
of the incubation were monitored and photographed with a microscope
(Olympus). Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the MS
media for 5 days were transferred onto new MS media, each containing
commercial humic acids, lignin, and lignin variants in the absence
or presence of NaCl (250 mM). After a further 7 day incubation, the
plants were photographed with a conventional digital camera and then
their chlorophyll was extracted by using 80% (v/v) acetone and then
quantitatively measured by using a visible spectrophotometer.8

Characterizations of Technical Lignins and
Their Fenton Variants
Lyophilized lignins and their Fenton
variants were treated with
gold sputtering after they were attached to a carbon tape (Tedpella).
The field-emission SEM (Philips, XL30S FEG) images of the powders
were then obtained to visualize their ultrastructures. The electrostatic
interactions made by the functional groups of lignins and their Fenton
variants were monitored using EFM scanning (+8 V tip, Nanoscope IV,
Veeco Instruments, Inc.). Flat plates of lignins for EFM analyses
were manufactured with a conventional compressor. The specific surface
areas (i.e., Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)) of the particles
were measured with N2 gas (ASAP 2010 system, Micromeritics
Corp.). The relative amounts of C, H, O, N, and S in the samples were
determined using a Flash EA 2000 series instrument (Thermo Fisher).
The solid-state 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a 400
MHz NMR spectrometer (Avance III HD, Bruker, Germany) with the use
of tetramethylsilane as a chemical shift reference. The operating
conditions used for the NMR experiments were described in detail previously.8 All of the powders were scanned 6000 times. The
X-band continuous-wave EPR spectra were obtained with a Bruker EMX
Plus 6/1 spectrometer equipped with a dual-mode cavity (ER 4116DM).
The detailed experimental parameters used were as described previously.8 The hydrodynamic size distribution and ζ-potentials
of the lignins and their Fenton variant particles dispersed in distilled
water were measured with an electrophoretic light-scattering spectrophotometer
(ELS 8000, Otsuka, Japan). The IR spectra of the powders were acquired
in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode (iS50, ThermoFisher).

ICP-OES (OPTIMA 5300DV) was employed to quantify Fe-containing inorganics
in commercial humic acids (i.e., Sigma, United States, and China),
lignins, and Fenton variants of lignins. The procedures for digesting
the organic materials used here have been described in detail previously.33 The organic materials were digested while heating
them up for 6 h up to 300 °C, diluted with distilled water (i.e.,
100 mL), and subsequently passed through a filter paper (AVANTEC,
no. 2, 9 cm diameter); these digested filtered organic materials were
then analyzed using ICP-OES analyses. The total amounts of phenolic
compounds in the lignins and their Fenton variants were determined
as described previously.44,45 The lignin particles
(0.5 mg) were added to a mixture of Folin and Ciocalteu’s phenol
reagent (0.25 mL) and distilled water (2.25 mL). The resulting mixture
was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and we mixed a 7% Na2CO3 (w/v) solution (2.5 mL) into this incubated
mixture. The resulting mixture was incubated for 90 min at room temperature,
and the intensity of the blue color generated in this mixture was
monitored at a wavelength of 550 nm with a visible spectrophotometer.
The absorbance of lignins and their Fenton variants totally dispersed
in distilled water samples (0.5 mg/mL) were monitored at 600 nm every
10 s for 5 min to evaluate the sedimentation kinetics. To remove the
Fe-containing inorganics after Fenton treatments, the lignin particles
were washed three times with 0.1 N HCl and then three times with distilled
water to achieve neutralization of the pH. The final powders were
lyophilized for further A. thaliana germination and ICP-OES analyses.

FT-ICR MS Analysis and
Elemental Composition Assignments
To obtain the elemental
compositions for lignin and Fenton variant
samples, ultrahigh-resolution mass spectra were acquired using a 15
T FT-ICR MS (solariXR system, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped
with the standard electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. The samples
dissolved in methanol including 7% NH4OH for pH adjustment
to 8 were directly infused into the MS at a flow rate of 3 μL/min
using a syringe pump and analyzed in negative ion mode at a capillary
voltage of 4.5 kV. The lower and upper mass limits were set to the
mass-to-charge (m/z) value of 150
and 1000, respectively. The drying gas flow rate was held at 1.5 L/min,
drying gas temperature at 200 °C, an ion accumulation time at
0.001 s, and a transient length at 2.796 s for all the experiments.
Two hundreds scans with 8 M words of data were collected per each
sample, resulting in a mass resolving power of greater than 900 000
(at m/z 400). The instrument was
externally calibrated using an arginine solution (10 μg/mL in
methanol) before the sample analysis. The data processing for elemental
composition assignments was conducted as described previously.8 The molecular formulas considering the elements
C, H, O, N, and S were deduced from the raw data by using Composer
software (Sierra Analytics, Modesto, CA). The formulas showing the
assignment errors >0.3 ppm were ruled out for further interpretation.
