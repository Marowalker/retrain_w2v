We report a simple
approach to fabricate a pyridinic-N-doped graphene
film (N-pGF) without high-temperature heat treatment from perforated
graphene oxide (pGO). pGO is produced by a short etching treatment
with hydrogen peroxide. GO perforation predominated in a short etching
time (∼1 h), inducing larger holes and defects compared to
pristine GO. The pGO is advantageous to the formation of a pyridinic
N-doped graphene because of strong NH3 adsorption on vacancies
with oxygen functional groups during the nitrogen-doping process,
and the pyridinic-N-doped graphene exhibits good electrocatalytic
activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Using rotating-disk
electrode measurements, we confirm that N-pGF undergoes a four-electron-transfer
process during the ORR in alkaline and acidic media by possessing
sufficient diffusion pathways and readily available ORR active sites
for efficient mass transport. A comparison between Pt/N-pGF and commercial
Pt/C shows that Pt/N-pGF has superior performance, based on its more
positive onset potential and higher limiting diffusion current at
−0.5 V.

Introduction
With increasing demand
for environmentally friendly and renewable
energy, the generation and storage of clean energy have become a major
concern.1,2 Electrocatalysts are important components
of promising clean energy technologies such as fuel cells, metal–air
batteries, and renewable energy.3−11 The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key step for clean energy
technologies. Various materials including metal oxides,3,4,7,9 heteroatom-doped
carbon nanotubes,12−16 few-layer graphene nanosheets,14,15,17−22 and graphene nanoribbons23,24 have been used to promote
the ORR in alkaline solutions. To improve their electrocatalytic ORR
performance, similar atomic-sized N atoms are used to dope the carbon
networks of graphene-based materials, with the resultant lone pair
electronic structure, facilitating reductive O2 adsorption.17,25,26 Thus, N-doped graphene is a promising
alternative to high-cost Pt, which is currently the best ORR catalyst.

The hybridization of the nitrogen atoms in graphitic networks is
a central factor that determines the unique electrocatalytic activity
of N-doped graphene for the ORR. Recent studies have shown that the
electrocatalytic activity of N-doped graphene depends on the presence
of pyridinic N (N bonded to two carbon atoms) or graphitic N (N bonded
to three carbon atoms).26−28 Pyridinic N atoms especially
facilitate electron transfer from the electronic bands of carbon in
the graphitic lattice to the antibonding orbitals of O2.12,29,30 Very recently,
Guo et al. reported that the ORR active sites are carbon atoms next
to pyridinic N by designing model graphite catalysts consisting of
pyridinic-N-dominated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and
graphitic N-dominated HOPG.26 The development
of facile methods for the synthesis of pyridinic-N-doped graphene
rich in ORR active sites is a major research topic in the field of
high-performance ORR catalysts, which necessarily includes the important
feature of favorable reactants’ and products’ access
to the active sites. However, most of the reported methods for N-doping
have required the heat treatment of between 600 and 1100 °C11,17−19 or have high cost,18 which
have drawbacks for large-scale production.

Here, we report a
facile and scalable approach without high-temperature
heat treatment to the large-scale production of N-doped graphene,
which has pyridinic-N-dominated catalytic sites for ORR. The pyridinic-N-doped
graphene film (N-pGF) was prepared from perforated graphene oxide
(pGO) at low temperature below 100 °C, which provided high ORR
active sites and sufficient diffusion pathways. Electrochemical measurements
showed that the pyridinic N endowed the material with a high degree
of electrocatalytic activity.

Result and Discussion
Graphene etching
treatments with H2O2 eventually
cause graphene to fracture into small pieces, and the etching reaction
time determines the lateral size and perforated structure of the graphene
fragments.31−33Figure 1A shows the synthetic procedure for treating GO with H2O2 to produce pGO.

Figure 1 (A) Schematic illustration of the fabrication
of GO-1 and GO-2.5
by time-dependent etching reaction. (B–D) AFM height images
and the corresponding line scan of (B) control GO, (C) GO-1, and (D)
GO-2.5 on the SiO2/Si substrate.

The corresponding tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM)
images
and line profiles are shown in Figure 1B–D. The GO flakes with H2O2 treatment for 1 and 2.5 h are designated as GO-1 and GO-2.5, respectively.
For the AFM imaging, the samples of the control GO, GO-1, and GO-2.5
were identically prepared on a SiO2/Si substrate by spin-coating.
Details of the sample preparation are given in the Experimental Section. As seen in Figure 1B, the control GO that did not undergo H2O2 treatment shows typical AFM images,34,35 with a measured thickness of ∼1.2 nm and no aggregation.
On the other hand, GO-1 and GO-2.5 aggregated to form large films,
as shown in Figure 1C,D, respectively. The GO-1 and GO-2.5 films exhibited the morphology
of dense, uniform, and self-assembled structures. Moreover, GO-1 and
GO-2.5 were well-connected with one another, forming large and homogeneous
∼1.4 nm thick monolayer films. This result indicates that the
materials containing more oxygen functional groups tend to cluster
together by an enhanced wettability and hydrogen bonding capability.36,37 Additionally, the self-assembled nanostructures of GO-1 and GO-2.5
show a clear phase contrast between GO-1 or GO-2.5 flakes and an empty
region on the SiO2 substrate (Figure S1). The AFM phase image of GO-2.5 shows many small, bright
spots that correspond to the nano-sized holes (or vacancies) formed
in the self-assembled GO-2.5 with lateral sizes of less than 100 nm
(Figure S1B). The result shows that GO-2.5
is broken into small fragments as the H2O2 treatment
time increases. The bright lines and small spots in the phase image
of the GO-1 film also indicate nano-sized holes (or vacancies) and
the two-dimensional nanocapillaries (Figure S1A).38 Although some small GO flakes were
present after H2O2 etching, most of the GO-1
sample had large lateral sizes (∼500 nm) on account of the
short etching reaction time. GO-1 was further characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM);
a comparison of the TEM images of control GO and GO-1 is shown in Figure 2A,B. The TEM image
of the GO-1 flakes shows nano-sized pores in the basal plane; no pores
are evident on the control GO that did not undergo H2O2 treatment. It is well-known that H2O2 is a strong oxidizing agent that generates nano-sized holes (or
vacancies) by the attack of H2O2 to sp2-hybridized domains around the initial defect sites of GO. The cross-sectional
SEM image of the GO-1 paper shows that more pores and a large thickness
of ∼3.1 nm were obtained relative to the tightly packed control
GO paper (∼1.8 nm thickness) (Figure 2C). The increase in the thickness of the
self-assembled GO-1 paper may be due to the additional number of oxygen-containing
functional groups after H2O2 etching.

We next prepared N-doped graphene solutions by simultaneous
N-doping
and reduction of the control GO, GO-1 (pGO), and GO-2.5 (GO nanofragments,
GOnf) in the presence of N2H4/NH3 for 1 h. This N-doping method in N2H4 and
NH3 is one of the most widely used methods in liquid-phase
environments and is the most successful approach to obtain a flat
N-doped graphene at low temperature from the pGO during N-doping and
reduction reactions. Films of these N-doped materials were then obtained
by filtration (Figure S2). We refer to
the N-doped reduced GO film as N-GF, the N-doped reduced pGO film
as N-pGF, and the N-doped reduced GOnf film as N-GnfF. Figure S2B shows images of N-doped graphene samples
that were prepared under the same conditions; N-GF and N-pGF were
obtained as a large freestanding film, and N-GnfF was obtained as
small film pieces of broken nanofragments.

We compared the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) results of N-pGF and N-GnfF
with N-GF, which did not undergo H2O2 etching
(Figure 3A), to characterize
the crystalline nature and degree of graphitization of the resulting
N-doped films. The N-GF and N-pGF films exhibited a sharp graphitic
peak of (002) at ∼25°, suggesting that they possess a
crystal structure similar to graphite.39 However, the peak corresponding to N-pGF [red line, 2θ = 23.2°, d = 3.83 Å, full width at half-maximum (fwhm) = 9.7]
was slightly broadened and lowered in 2θ relative to that of
N-GF (black line, 2θ = 24.9°, d = 3.58
Å, fwhm = 8.2). These results indicate that the interlayer spacing
of N-pGF expanded because of the reaction of GO with H2O2. Unlike N-pGF, N-GnfF showed a broad diffraction pattern
with weak peak intensity, indicating a low degree of crystallinity.
This finding is consistent with the AFM analysis. Therefore, the H2O2 etching treatment induces considerable fracturing
of the GO flakes even with a reaction time of 2.5 h.

Figure 3 (A) XRD, (B) FTIR, and
(C) Raman spectra of N-GF (black line),
N-pGF (red line), and N-GnfF (blue line).

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was also used
to
understand these structural changes. Figure 3B shows the characteristic IR peaks for the
N-doped graphene films. As reported previously in N-doped graphene,28 N-GF shows the typical four peaks at 3600–3100,
1593, 1326, and 1050 cm–1 that correspond to the
O–H stretching vibrations, a combination of C=C and
C=N in-plane stretching vibrations, and C–O stretching
vibrations, respectively. Relative to N-GF, both N-pGF and N-GnfF
exhibited stronger absorption bands for oxygen-related groups at 1725–1650
cm–1 (νC=O), 1570 and 1433 cm–1 (skeletal vibrations of aromatic rings), 1251 cm–1 (νC–N aromatic), and 1141 cm–1 (νC–O
of C–OH). The O–H and C–O stretching vibrations
of C–OH were more prominent in N-GnfF, suggesting that the
more highly etched N-GnfF caused a higher intensity in the O–H
band. In N-pGF, the νCH and νC=O bands at 2950
and 1725–1650 cm–1, respectively, are predominant
in the perforated graphene structure. The νCH peaks are attributed
to the stretching vibration of aliphatic CH groups of the vacancies
and edges induced by the etching treatment. The C=O stretching
mode is sensitive to its surrounding environment including conjugation,
hydrogen bonding, and ring strain. The νC=O modes at
the vacancies and edges in N-pGF were observed at 1650–1695
cm–1 (unsaturated and amidic C=O at vacancies)
and 1724 cm–1 (ketones at edges), whereas that of
N-GnfF was observed at 1724 cm–1 for the edge ketones.40 Additionally, the strong νC–N band
at 1251 cm–1 was assigned to aromatic amide groups,
and aromatic CH out-of-plane bending vibrations appeared between 900
and 600 cm–1. Thus, the oxygen-functionalized groups
of N-pGF and N-GnfF increasingly determine the interlayer distance
of the graphene nanoflakes, which is consistent with the XRD data.

Figure 3C shows
the Raman spectra of N-GF, N-pGF, and N-GnfF. The Raman spectra of
all graphene materials typically exhibit two bands27,34 D and G, located at ∼1348–1352 and ∼1585–1592
cm–1, respectively. The D band corresponds to the
sp3-hybridized carbon atoms at the vacancies and edges
of graphene flakes, whereas the G band corresponds to the E2g vibrational mode of the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in
the hexagonal structure. The N-GF samples, which did not undergo H2O2 treatment, showed bands similar to the D band
at 1350 cm–1 and the G band at 1592 cm–1, with a D to G band intensity ratio (ID/IG) of 1.02. By comparison, the ID/IG values of the
H2O2-treated N-pGF and N-GnfF were 1.08 and
1.18, respectively, which is higher than that of N-GF. Higher ID/IG ratios are
associated with a more disordered carbon network. Thus, these results
indicate that N-pGF and N-GnfF had more vacancies or edges than N-GF.

We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the
chemical environments of N-GF, N-pGF, and N-GnfF. The survey spectra
of all samples showed principal peaks corresponding to carbon (C 1s
at ∼284 eV), oxygen (O 1s at ∼530 eV), and nitrogen
(N 1s at ∼398 eV) (Figure. S3).
The O/C atomic ratios of N-GF, N-pGF, and N-GnfF were 0.15, 0.19,
and 0.30, respectively, demonstrating that N-GnfF had a relatively
higher level of oxidation than either N-GF or N-pGF (Figure. S3C). The deconvoluted high-resolution C 1s and N
1s spectra are shown in Figure 4. The C 1s peak can be divided into five subpeaks: C=C
(284.4 eV), C=N (285.4 eV), C–N/C–OH (286.4 eV),
C=O (287.9 eV), and O=C–OH (289.2 eV). The C
1s spectra of the N-doped graphene samples are dominated by the peak
corresponding to sp2-hybridized graphite-like carbon at
284.4 eV (Figure 4A–D).
The area of these peaks indicates that N-GF consists of 59.9% sp2-hybridized C atoms; by comparison, the sp2-hybridized
C fraction decreased to 48.4% for N-pGF and 41.7% for N-GnfF.

raw data are represented by a black dotted line, whereas the fitted
curve is represented by a red line.

Additionally, the C–N/C–OH content in N-GnfF
was
15.4%, whereas N-GF and N-pGF contained a much smaller amount (1.5–3.5%).
Collectively, the high OH content in N-GnfF, as confirmed by FTIR
spectroscopy, and these XPS results suggest an enrichment of hydroxyl
groups in N-GnfF.

The N 1s XPS spectrum was also used to determine
the N-bonding
configurations. The high-resolution N 1s peaks were fitted into three
types of N bonding at 398.4, 399.2, and 401.3 eV, corresponding to
pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic N, respectively (Figure 4E–H). Analysis of the
fitted N 1s peaks showed that the predominant types were pyridinic
and pyrrolic N; the pyridinic-N contents are 2.1, 3.9 and 1.7% for
N-GF, N-pGF, and N-GnfF, respectively. N-pGF had a higher content
of pyridinic N than N-GF and N-GnfF, which may result from structural
defects such as vacancies and edges, as well as a large number of
active sites. Li et al. used ab initio molecular dynamic simulations
to show that NH3 molecules are well-trapped by the vacancies
of defective graphene and that pyridinic N is formed in the vicinity
of double vacancies by a doping process.41 This previous report suggests that the vacancies of defective pGO
are beneficial to the formation of pyridinic N. On increasing the
N-doping reaction time from 1 to 10 h (N-pGF-10), the total N amount
increased from 4.78 to 6.63%. A distinct higher-energy peak corresponding
to graphitic N appeared at 401.3 eV, indicating that a lengthy N-doping
reaction favors the formation of graphitic N (Figure 4H). The pyridinic-N and graphitic-N contents
of N-pGF-10 were 4.1 and 2.5%, respectively; the pyrrolic/pyridinic
N accounted for only a small portion of the total N content.

Thus, the strongly oxidizing free radicals generated by H2O2 can induce graphene perforation by the electrophilic
attack and oxidation of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. During
the etching reaction at 85–90 °C, the perforation of graphene
predominated in the short etching time of ∼1 h, and as the
etching reaction was further increased to 1.5 h, fractured GOnf with
high OH functionality were formed rather than increased perforation.
A pyridinic-N-doped graphene tends to be produced on vacancies of
the pGO during the nitrogen-doping process. A schematic representation
for the formation of N-pGF, N-pGF-10, and N-GnfF is illustrated in Figure S4.

Finally, the electrochemical
ORR activity of N-pGF and N-GnfF was
examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in N2- and O2-saturated alkaline media. A clear oxygen reduction peak with
increasing current was observed in the O2-saturated electrolyte
solution but not in the N2-saturated solution (Figure S5). Figure 5A shows a comparison of the CV curves of
N-pGF, N-GnfF, N-GF, and bare glassy carbon (GC) in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. As seen, N-pGF has a much higher
current density and more positive peak potential compared with the
other samples, suggesting an enhanced electrocatalytic ORR activity.
We also compared the ORR capability of N-pGF with that of N-pGF-10,
which had a higher N content. Despite the higher N content in N-pGF-10,
it exhibited a decreased current density with no peak potential shift
and its CV curve resembled that of N-GnfF. This finding is supported
by its corresponding XRD results (Figure S6). We further established the activity of N-pGF using linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) with a rotating-disk electrode (RDE) by comparing
our material with a reference sample of commercial 20% Pt/C under
the same conditions. The LSV curves of N-GF, N-pGF, N-pGF-10, N-GnfF,
and Pt/C were obtained in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte
at 1600 rpm and 10 mV s–1 (Figure 5B). The onset potentials were determined
from the intersection between the baseline and the signal current.
The onset potentials of N-GF, N-pGF, N-pGF-10, and N-GnfF were −0.17,
−0.12, −0.19, and −0.23 V (vs Ag|AgCl), respectively,
which followed the order of N-pGF > N-GF > N-pGF-10 > N-GnfF
(Figure 5C). N-pGF,
which
possesses a relatively high pyridinic N and very low pyrrolic and
graphitic-N contents, showed the lowest onset potential and the highest
limiting diffusion current, suggesting that it has excellent electrocatalytic
activity for the ORR. Relative to Pt/C, N-pGF showed a small downshift
of 64 mV in the half-wave potential (E1/2) and a higher limiting diffusion current at −0.5 V. Relative
to N-pGF, N-pGF-10 showed a more negative onset potential and a lower
limiting current, which is noteworthy because N-pGF-10 possesses the
most graphitic-N functionality (Table S1). These results confirm the low contribution of graphitic and pyrrolic
N to the ORR. Moreover, these results are consistent with a recent
report that pyridinic N is much more active than graphitic N in a
model HOPG ORR catalyst.26

Figure 5D–F
shows the electrochemical activity of N-pGF for the ORR process at
different rotational rates and a comparison of Pt/N-pGF and commercial
Pt/C. The diffusion current density values increased with the increasing
rotation rate, while the onset potentials were almost independent
of the rotation rate. Figure 5E shows Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots from the
LSV curves of Figure 5D. The slopes of the K–L plots were used to calculate the
number of electrons transferred (n) using eqs 1 and 2(42) 1   2  where j is the measured current
density, jk and jL are the kinetic and diffusion limiting current density, respectively,
ω is the rotating speed of the RDE (rad s–1), n is the overall number of electrons transferred
in the oxygen reduction, F is the Faraday constant
(96 485 C mol–1), D is the
diffusion coefficient of oxygen (1.9 × 10–5 cm2 s–1), v is the
kinematic viscosity of 0.1 M KOH (0.01 cm2 s–1), and C is the bulk concentration of oxygen in
the electrolyte (1.2 × 10–6 mol cm–3). The linearity of the K–L plots at different potentials
suggests first-order reaction kinetics for the reduction of dissolved
oxygen. The parallel lines show that similar numbers of electrons
were transferred in the ORR. The electron-transfer number (n) was calculated to be 3.9 (±0.2) from −0.3
to −0.7 V (vs Ag|AgCl). The calculated jk value shows a current density of 20.8 mA cm–2 at −0.5 V. The Tafel slope is 39.7 mV/dec and is comparable
to that of Pt/C (34.5 mV/dec) (inset of Figure 5E). These results suggest that the ORR kinetics
of N-pGF gives rise to a facile 4e– transfer and are similar to those of Pt/C. The N-pGF exhibits good
electrocatalytical activity in an alkaline electrolyte for ORR and
shows higher ORR catalytic performance than the N graphene synthesized
at high temperature of 800 °C or much better ORR activity than
the electrochemical synthesized N graphene at room temperature (Table S1).

To evaluate the ORR activity
of N-doped graphene samples in acidic
solution, we obtained the linear sweep voltammograms in an O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 1600
rpm 10 mV s–1 (Figure S7A). The ORR onset potentials were 0.018, 0.045, −0.110, and
0.009 V for N-GF, N-pGF, N-GnfF, and N-pGF-10, respectively. N-pGF
showed the lowest onset potential and the highest limiting diffusion
current. LSV curves at different rotation rates (400–2000 rpm)
are shown in Figure S7B, and the corresponding
K–L plots at various applied potentials are shown in Figure S7C. The diffusion current density values
increased with the increasing rotation rate, while the onset potentials
were almost independent of the rotation rate. The K–L plots
show good linearity. From the linear fitted K–L plots, the
calculated electron-transfer number is 3.6–4.2. The ORR activity
of N-pGF is coincident with the results in alkaline solution.

To examine the stability and the crossover effect of methanol tolerance,
the chronoamperometric responses on ORR at N-pGF and Pt/C electrodes
were obtained at a constant potential of −0.6 V in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 (Figure 6A–D). In a
0.1 M KOH electrolyte, N-pGF shows higher stability (94.6%) than Pt/C
(91%). Under a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, N-pGF
and Pt/C exhibit similar stability before 1.5 h. After 4 h, N-pGF
retains 89.3% current density. After addition of methanol, the ORR
current for the N-pGF electrode was slightly changed in both alkaline
and acidic electrolytes, while Pt/C exhibited a distinct drop (Figure 6C,D). N-pGF is a
durable catalyst with high methanol tolerance for ORR.

The excellent ORR activity
of N-pGF is reflected by the influence
of pyridinic-N-doping-induced charge redistribution. Pyridinic N with
lone pair electrons can accept electrons from the adjacent carbon
atoms, which is favorable for the adsorption of O2 or OOH
and ultimately facilitates the reduction of OH to form H2O. On the basis of the K–L analysis, N-pGF shows similar electron-transfer
numbers of 3.9 (±0.2) at different potentials and a small Tafel
slope of 39.7 mV/dec at low overpotentials. These results are consistent
with those of the reported N-doped graphene,19,26 which suggest the four-electron ORR pathway of N-pGF in the direct
four-electron mechanism or sequential 2 + 2 electron mechanism with
OOH– formation. The catalytic activity of N-doped
graphene is highly related to the pyridinic-N-bonding configuration.

We also compared the LSV curves for the ORR with 20% Pt/N-pGF and
commercial 20% Pt/C in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at 10 mV
s–1 and 1600 rpm (Figure 6F). As seen, Pt/N-pGF exhibited much better
performance than the commercial Pt/C in terms of the onset potential
and limiting diffusion current, showing a positive shift of 30 mV
in the onset potential and 1.3 times higher limiting diffusion current
at −0.5 V. The electron-transfer numbers (n) calculated from the K–L plots for Pt/C and Pt/N-pGF were
3.4 ± 0.2 and 4.0 ± 0.3 between −0.2 and −0.6
V (vs Ag|AgCl), respectively (Figure S8). The high performance of Pt/N-pGF can be attributed to a fast ORR
and an abundance of electrocatalytic active sites in N-pGF, which
are present because of its perforated structure and pyridinic-N functionality.

Conclusions
In summary, we report a facile and straightforward approach without
high-temperature heat treatment to prepare perforated pyridinic-N-doped
graphene with high active sites and effective diffusion pathways for
a fast ORR. Under the etching time of GO and the N-doping reaction
time of 1 h, a pyridinic-N-doped graphene film was produced by pGO,
which showed a higher pyridinic-N content (3.9%) than that of either
N-GF (2.1%) or N-GnfF (1.7%). When the N-doping reaction time of pGO
was increased from 1 h to 10 h (N-pGF-10), the total N content increased
from 4.78 to 6.63%. The N 1s XPS spectrum of N-pGF-10 showed a distinct
graphitic-N peak at 401.3 eV, indicating that a lengthy N-doping reaction
favors the formation of graphitic N. Despite N-pGF-10 having the most
graphitic-N functionality, it showed a smaller contribution to the
ORR performance than N-pGF. By comparison, N-pGF, which had predominantly
pyridinic-N functionality, showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity
and four-electron transfer, suggesting that pyridinic N caused the
high electrocatalytic activity. A comparison between 20% Pt/N-pGF
and commercial 20% Pt/C showed that the performance of Pt/N-pGF was
superior in terms of its onset potential and limiting diffusion current.
These results provide an easily scalable method for the preparation
of N-doped graphene catalysts that are rich in ORR active sites, which
would be invaluable to applications in the areas of catalysts, sensors,
and nanoelectronics.

Experimental Section
Materials and Characterization
GO (>7 μm, Standard
Graphene Co. Ltd. South Korea), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 wt % in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrazine (35
wt % in H2O, Aldrich), and ammonium hydroxide solution
(28% NH3 in H2O, purity ≥99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich)
were used as received. Deionized (DI) water with a resistivity of
18 MΩ cm was used for all experiments.

XRD patterns were
collected using a high-power microarea X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku,
D/MAX-2500) using Cu Kα radiation. XPS elemental analysis was
carried out using a K-Alpha XPS analyzer with monochromatic Al Kα
X-ray sources (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The XPS spectra
were fitted using a Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shape after baseline
correction. Raman spectra were obtained at 514 nm using a HORIBA Jobin
Yvon LabRAM-HR instrument (HORIBA Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA). The
silicon peak at 520 cm–1 was used to calibrate the
absolute peak position. FTIR spectra were obtained using a Nicolet
iS50 FT-IR spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with a
DLaTGS attenuated total reflection accessory. AFM measurements were
performed with a Digital Instruments Dimension (D3100, Veeco). Samples
were prepared for AFM imaging by spin-coating at 2000 rpm (100 μL
of 1 mg/mL GO, pGO, and GOnf was spin-coated onto a 1 × 1 cm
SiO2/Si substrate) and dried under vacuum for 15 h. TEM
images were recorded using a JEOL JEM 2100F transmission electron
microscope using a Cu grid coated with a lacey carbon film. TEM samples
were prepared by drop-casting a very dilute dispersion on a substrate
and drying under ambient conditions. CV and LSV analyses were carried
out in a standard three-electrode system using a BAS electrochemical
analyzer (BAS 100B, USA) coupled with a Pine Modulated Speed Rotator
system. A GC electrode (geometric area: 0.2 cm2) was used
as the working electrode and was polished to a mirror finish with
0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina. Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the
counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All N-doped graphene
samples were dispersed by sonication in a mixture of DI water and
dimethylformamide (DMF) (1 mg/mL) containing 10 wt % Nafion to form
a homogeneous graphene ink. From these dispersions, 15 μL was
drop-casted onto the GC electrode and allowed to dry at 23–25
°C. Finally, this electrode was further dried in vacuum. CVs
were obtained between −1.0 and 0.2 V (vs Ag|AgCl) at 50 mV
s–1 in an O2-saturated and N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. LSV was performed to determine
the ORR activity using a RDE in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH
electrolyte at 10 mV s–1 with a rotational rate
of 400, 800, 1200, 1600, or 2000 rpm. For comparison, commercial 20
wt % Pt on graphitized carbon (Pt/C, 20 wt % Pt on Vulcan XC 72, Aldrich)
was also measured.

Preparation of pGO
The pGO materials
were prepared
according to the following procedure: GO powder was dispersed in DI
water and sonicated for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension (2.2
mg/mL). A H2O2 aqueous solution (30%, 5 mL)
was added to the GO aqueous dispersion (30 mL) and then refluxed at
85–90 °C for either 1 h or 2.5 h under stirring. The resulting
mixtures of GO-1 and GO-2.5 were left to stand for 30 min and then
purified by filtration (membrane filter with a pore size of 0.2 or
0.025 μm). The resultants were then washed with DI water to
remove the residual H2O2 before being redispersed
in DI water by ultrasonication for 10 min. The preparation of GO-1
(pGO) and GO-2.5 (GOnf) can be easily scaled up. The starting GO dispersion
was used as a control sample.

Preparation of N-Doped
Graphene Films (N-GF, N-GnfF, N-pGF,
and N-pGF-10)
N-pGF, N-GnfF, and N-GF were prepared by the
simultaneous N-doping and reduction of pGO, GOnf, and control GO in
the presence of N2H4/NH3 for 1 h.
The pGO and GOnf dispersions (0.2 mg/mL, 100 mL) were each mixed with
ammonium hydroxide (350 μL, 28% NH3) and hydrazine
(50 μL, 35 wt %) solution in a round-bottom flask with a Teflon
cap and then reacted in a water bath at 95 °C for 1 h without
stirring. After cooling to 60 °C, the reaction mixture was filtered
with an Anodisc membrane filter (aluminum oxide membrane, 0.02 μm)
and washed with DI water and methanol. The resultant films were obtained
in the form of a black freestanding film (Figure S2). N-pGF-10 was prepared from pGO by a simultaneous N-doping
and reduction reaction for 10 h under the same conditions as N-pGF.

Electrochemical Measurements
To maintain the as-is
structure of N-pGF, the working electrode was carefully prepared so
that the N-pGF form was not broken into particles. N-pGF was dispersed
in a mixture of DI water and DMF (1 mg/mL) containing 10 μL
Nafion solution (10 wt %) with mild sonication for 1 min to form a
uniform graphene ink. From the dispersion, 15 μL was drop-casted
onto a GC electrode or a RDE and allowed to dry at 23–25 °C.
Finally, this electrode was further dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight.
All N-doped graphene and commercial 20 wt % Pt on graphitized carbon
(Pt/C, 20 wt % Pt on Vulcan XC 72, Aldrich) electrodes were prepared
in the same conditions as N-pGF. CVs were obtained between −1.0
and 0.2 V (vs Ag|AgCl) at 50 mV s–1 in an O2-saturated and N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH or 0.5 M
H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. LSV was performed
to determine the ORR activity using a RDE in an O2-saturated
0.1 M KOH or 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 10 mV
s–1 with a rotational rate of 400, 800, 1200, 1600,
or 2000 rpm. For comparison, commercial 20 wt % Pt/C was also measured.
Stability and methanol tolerance tests on N-pGF and Pt/C were conducted
by chronoamperometry at a constant potential of −0.6 V (vs
Ag|AgCl) in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH or 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.
