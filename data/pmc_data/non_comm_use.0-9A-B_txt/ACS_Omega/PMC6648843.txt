Co-, Ni-, and Zn-containing MOFs
are prepared and then pyrolyzed
to generate materials for ambient temperature NO adsorption. Materials
containing Co are much more efficient for NO adsorption than those
containing Ni and Zn; therefore, Co is identified as the active phase.
The best performing material studied here achieves 100% low concentration
(10 ppm) NO adsorption for more than 15 h under a weight hourly space
velocity of 120 000 mL g–1 h–1. Powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier
transform infrared, and Raman spectroscopies, along with scanning
electron microscopy and TEM, are used to probe the physicochemical
properties of the materials, particularly the Co active phase, and
chemistries involved in NO adsorption–desorption. NO adsorbs
on oxygen-covered Co nanoparticle surfaces in the form of nitrates
and desorbs as NO at higher temperatures as a result of surface nitrate
decomposition. NO storage capacity decreases gradually upon repeated
NO adsorption–desorption cycles, likely because of Co3O4 formation during these processes.

1 Introduction
Nitrogen
Oxides (NOx) emitted from automobiles has long been recognized
as a major pollutant to the environment and to human health. Over
the past decades, three-way catalysis,1,2 NOx storage
and reduction,3,4 and selective catalytic reduction5−8 processes have been developed and commercialized to eliminate NOx
generated by vehicles. Even though these processes are highly efficient,
and certainly responsible for the air quality improvement we have
experienced in recent years, none of them can eliminate 100% tailpipe
NOx, especially during the so-called “cold-start”.9 As such, in places of poor ventilation, for example,
underground transportation tunnels and indoor parking lots, low concentrations
of unconverted NOx (up to 10 ppm, mainly as NO) from engine exhausts
can accumulate. Air quality in such places is harmful to human health,
especially with long periods of exposure. Removal of NOx from these
locations in highly economical ways, however, is extremely challenging
because of the low NOx concentrations and because of the vast air
volumes.

Passing air that contains NOx through basic solutions
or solid
adsorbers, during which NOx is either reacted or adsorbed, appears
to be a viable solution. However, because NO2 is in most
cases much more reactive than NO, it is essential to first (catalytically)
oxidize NO to NO2, preferably at ambient temperatures and
high space velocities prior to the adsorption stage. In the past few
years, a few groups discovered that some early transition-metal oxides
catalyze ambient temperature NO oxidation quite efficiently. For example,
Shi and coworkers systematically investigated manganese oxide and
MnOx-containing binary oxide catalysts
for ambient temperature NO oxidation.10,11 Because of
a few restraints, for example, quick nitrate poisoning and low thermal
stability, practical applications of these catalysts have not yet
been realized. Liu et al.12 reported that
CrOx prepared by ammonia precipitation
can oxidize low-concentration NO to NO2 at ambient temperature,
and NO2 is then readily adsorbed by an alkaline solution.
However, this catalyst does not catalyze NO oxidation with high efficiency.
More recently, our group discovered that Cr–X (X = Zr, Co,
Fe, Ni) bimetallic oxides synthesized with a sol–gel method
are more efficient in catalyzing oxidation of low-concentration NO
at ambient temperatures.13,14 These catalysts also
display considerable reusability and water resistance. Unfortunately,
the high toxicity of chromium oxides may preclude their practical
use. Recently, (doped) activated carbon materials have also been found
to oxidize NO to NO2 at ambient temperatures. For example,
Wang et al.15,16 discovered that activated carbon
nanofibers display good efficiency in both oxidizing and trapping
low-concentration NO (20 ppm). Particularly, when such materials are
modified with transition-metal oxides (e.g., MnO2), NO
oxidation capacity can be further enhanced.17

An alternative approach is to use solid materials to adsorb
(trap)
NO directly. In this case, NO oxidation to NO2 is no longer
a prerequisite, even though some of such materials may still catalyze
NO oxidation to NO2 as part of the trapping process. In
the past few years, researchers have discovered that Pd-exchanged
zeolite materials are efficient passive NOx adsorbers that can be
used to trap NOx from diesel engine exhausts during the cold start.18−20 However, these materials are likely too costly for use in removing
low-concentration NOx from air. For this latter application, desirable
materials should have the following features: low cost, low toxicity,
high stability, and reusability.

Metal–organic framework
(MOF) materials are a new class
of porous crystalline materials that have been widely investigated
and applied for various applications including the storage of hydrogen
and hydrocarbons,21,22 gas purification,23,24 and sensor techniques,25,26 to name a few. Because
of their limited thermal stability, these materials are typically
not suitable for high-temperature applications. Thanks to their high
surface area, tunable porosity, and controllable structures, however,
MOFs can be treated by various methods (e.g., pyrolysis) to form thermally
stable materials with unique porous nanostructures. In the present
study, we seek to synthesize low-cost carbon-supported early transition-metal
(oxide) materials by MOF pyrolysis and use them in ambient temperature
NOx trapping. Note that even though our target NOx trapping temperature
is ambient, regeneration of such materials after use requires elevated
temperature treatments. Therefore, high-temperature stability is a
requirement for these materials. This study is inspired by the findings
described above that activated carbon materials show promise for this
application and by the fact that high-temperature treatment of MOFs
leads to the formation of materials with high surface areas and specific
structures. For example, when the high-temperate treatment is done
in the presence of O2, metal oxides such as Co3O4, Mn2O3, and bimetal oxides are
generated;27−29 whereas in the absence of O2 (i.e., pyrolysis),
nanoporous carbon materials are generated.30−32

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Material Preparation
Co-MOF (ZIF-67)
was used as the precursor of the NO adsorber materials. The synthesis
of ZIF-67 has been described in detail in recent literature.33,34 Important synthesis parameters have been identified as the 2-methylimidazole
(C4H6N2) to cobalt ion ratio and
the solvent of choice (methanol or deionized water). In the present
study, 1.092 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Macklin, 99%) and 1.232 g of 2-methylimidazole (Aladdin, 98%)
were first dissolved in 30 mL of methanol (general-reagent, ≥99.5%),
and the two solutions were then mixed. The mixture was stirred at
30 °C for 8 h for Co-MOF (ZIF-67) formation. Purple-colored solid
ZIF-67 was collected with filtration and washed a few times by methanol.
It was then dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. Similarly,
by using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Shanghai
Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, 99%) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd, 99%) to replace cobalt nitrate, Zn-MOF (ZIF-8) and Ni-MOF
were prepared.

Pyrolysis of the MOF materials was carried out
by heating the samples placed in a ceramic crucible to target temperatures
of 500, 550, and 600 °C at 5 °C/min and maintaining at these
temperatures for 1 h, in a flowing nitrogen (Air Liquide, 99.999%)
atmosphere. After cooling to ambient temperature in N2,
the samples were ground, pressed, and sieved to 40–60 mesh
size in the open air, prior to their use in NO trapping. The materials
thus prepared are designed as M-T, where M represents
the transition metal and T represents the pyrolysis
temperature. For example, Co-600 denotes the material containing Co
that is heat-treated at 600 °C.

2.2 NO Adsorption
and Desorption Tests
Ambient temperature NO trapping was
carried out in a continuous flow
quartz reactor (i.d. = 8 mm) and 0.15 g of the sample was used for
each test. The reaction temperature was maintained at 25 °C by
immersing the reactor in a thermostatic water bath. The reaction feed
gas contained 10 ppm NO, 21 vol % O2, and balance argon.
The total gas flow was 300 mL min–1, resulting in
a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 120 000 mL g–1 h–1. Before each test, the sample was pretreated at 300 °C for
1 h in argon (200 mL min–1) and then cooled to 25
°C in the same gas. Inlet and outlet NOx (NO and NO2) concentrations were continuously recorded by an on-line NOx analyzer
(Thermo Fisher 42i-LS).

NO removal efficiency is calculated
by the following equation 1  where subscripts “inlet” and
“outlet” represent the inlet and outlet NO concentrations,
respectively. The NO trapping measurement was stopped when inlet and
outlet NO concentrations were identical (i.e., adsorption saturation),
following which, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was performed
by heating the sample from 30 to 400 °C in flowing Ar at a ramping
rate of 5 °C min–1 and maintaining at 400 °C
until no NOx desorption was observable. Samples with the adsorption–desorption
cycle described above were tested again for ambient temperature NO
adsorption to evaluate their stability and reusability.

2.3 Characterizations
Most of the characterizations
described below were conducted on freshly prepared materials stored
in air and on materials after desorption of trapped NO. Some measurements
were also performed on samples with adsorbed NO to elucidate chemistries
involved in NO trapping.

Transient-metal contents (i.e., Co,
Ni, and Zn) of the materials were measured using an inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) apparatus (Varian 710).

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an ESCALAB
250Xi focus diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 100
mA, λ = 1.5406 Å), with 2θ ranging from 10°
to 80° at a step size of 0.02°. The grain sizes of the samples
were calculated by the Scherrer equation. Crystalline phase identification
was made using the JCPDS database.

Specific surface areas were
measured with a Micromeritics ASAP
2020 M surface area and pore size analyzer by N2 adsorption
at 77 K. Before the measurements, all samples were pretreated at 80
°C in vacuum for 720 min. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method was adopted for surface area calculations.

Diffuse
reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra were collected
on a Nicolet Nexus 6700 spectrometer equipped with a mercury–cadmium–telluride
detector and a Harrick diffuse reflectance cell with CaF2 windows. Ground fine powders were used for the measurements, with
a scanning range of 400–4000 cm–1.

Raman spectra was collected using a Renishaw invia Raman microscope
equipped with a CCD detector. The excitation wavelength of laser beam
was 514 nm with a power of 1 mW at a resolution of 4 cm–1. Each spectrum was a sum of two scans recorded from 300 to 3000
cm–1.

X-ray photoelectron spectra were collected
on a PHI-Quantera SXM
spectrometer with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation. The excitation
source was under ultrahigh vacuum (6.7 × 10–8 Pa). Binding energies (BE) were calibrated with the adventitious
carbon C 1s BE of 284.4 eV. The powder samples were pressed into self-supporting
disks and evacuated for 4 h before tests. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were deconvoluted and fitted by a Gaussian
function with the XPSPEAK 4.1 software.

Field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained
by a scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 200 SEM, FEI Company,
Hillsboro, OR) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) analysis function
operated at the beam energy of 3 kV. All samples were coated with
a thin layer of evaporated gold. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were acquired on a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin electron microscope
operated at 200 kV. The samples were first dispersed in ethanol and
then deposited on copper grids covered with carbon film.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Composition and Pyrolysis
Temperature Effects
Note first that the as-prepared MOF materials
do not possess any
ambient temperature NO adsorption capacity. However, it is no longer
the case after pyrolysis. NO trapping efficiency was first tested
on Co-600, Ni-600, and Zn-600 samples, and the results are shown in Figure 1a. These results
reveal that Co-600 is significantly more efficient in trapping NO
than the other two samples; the former achieves 100% NO trapping efficiency
for ∼6 h. Ni-600 shows some initial NO adsorption capacity
but deactivates too rapidly. Zn-600 essentially has no NOx trapping
capacity. Such dramatic differences in NOx trapping performance may
be a result of differences in metal loadings, surface areas, pore
structures, or the nature of the metal-containing species. To obtain
information to pinpoint the key causes, metal loadings and surface
areas of these materials are presented immediately below. Besides
the three samples used for the initial NOx adsorption tests, Co-500
and Co-550 are also included. Table 1 presents the Co, Ni, and Zn contents for all of the
samples studied here. In comparing the three M-600 samples, it is
readily seen that their metal contents are similar (Ni content is
somewhat higher). This immediately demonstrates that the NOx storage
capacity difference shown in Figure 1a is irrelevant to metal loading. By comparing the
Co-T samples, it is also readily seen that with increasing
pyrolysis temperature, the Co content increases. This is because higher
temperature causes more complete decomposition of the MOF structure,
thus releasing more gaseous products. As indicated from specific surface
areas of these materials tabulated in Table 2, such a dramatic difference in NO storage
is also irrelevant to their surface areas. These observations lead
us to believe that phases containing the transition metals are responsible
for NO adsorption; clearly, phases containing Co possess much better
NO storage capacity than those containing Ni or Zn. Therefore, Ni-
and Zn-containing materials are no longer explored in the rest of
the study. More information regarding these samples is nevertheless
presented in the Supporting Information (Figures S1and S3). Next, the ZIF-67 pyrolysis temperature effect
was explored. As depicted in Figure 1b, Co-500 shows a remarkable 100% NO trapping duration
of ∼15 h, whereas Co-550 and Co-600 display such durations
of ∼11 and ∼6 h, respectively. Again, this efficiency
difference is irrelevant to material surface areas. As shown in Table 2, Co-550/600 even
has a specific surface area higher than that of Co-500, presumably
because of extra porosity generated at higher pyrolysis temperatures.35 However, their NO storage capacities are apparently
inferior to the latter.

and Zn-600, and (b)

21% of O2 balanced with Ar at a WHSV of 120 000
mL g–1 h–1 and a reaction temperature
of 25 °C.

3.2 Morphological and Physicochemical
Properties
X-ray diffractograms of Co-500/550/600 are shown
in Figure 2. The three
samples exhibit
similar diffraction patterns with essentially identical reflection
angles suggesting their structural similarity. A metallic cobalt phase
with diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ = 44.3, 51.6 and 76.0°
is found as the predominant crystalline phase.36,37 Therefore, it can be concluded that this metallic Co phase is responsible
for NO trapping. By exploiting the Scherrer equation, Co particles
are estimated to be 11.5, 13.9, and 21.5 nm, respectively, for the
Co-500/550/600 samples. The increase of particle size with increasing
pyrolysis temperature is likely due to increased particle sintering
at higher temperatures. The fact that NO trapping efficiency decreases
with increasing Co particle size further corroborates the statement
that Co is the active phase for NO adsorption. Another crystalline
phase appears at 2θ = 25.9° for all three samples, which
is attributed to graphitic carbon.38,39 The intensities
of these features are extremely weak, suggesting that large quantities
of carbon in these samples are amorphous. To verify this point, Raman
spectroscopy was used to probe these samples, and the results are
shown in Figure 3.
All of the three samples exhibit two strong bands: one at 1590 cm–1 attributed to graphitic carbon and one at 1350 cm–1 assigned to amorphous carbon.40 Intensities of the two bands are comparable for all samples,
suggesting, indeed, a highly disordered nature of the carbon matrix.
Note also that no Raman scattering is found below 1000 cm–1; this may suggest the absence of cobalt oxides in these samples.
For example, Co3O4 possesses five Raman-active
modes at 194, 482, 522, 618, and 691 cm–1.41 However, because these materials have been stored
in the open air after pyrolysis, the presence of chemisorbed oxygen
or even a surface oxide layer on cobalt is rather anticipated. Therefore,
the absence of Co–O scattering may be better rationalized such
that the total amount of surface oxygen is below the detection limit
of our Raman spectrometer.

Co-600.

SEM was used to study morphologies
of the as-synthesized ZIF-67
material and Co-500/550/600 samples. ZIF-67 contains primarily dodecahedral
and to a lesser extent cubic primary particles ∼1 μm
in size, as displayed in Figure S2. SEM
images of the Co-500/550/600 samples are exhibited in Figure 4 at two magnification levels.
As shown in Figure 4A–C, the primary particles largely maintain their morphologies
after pyrolysis; however, for Co-600, some level of primary particle
aggregation is clearly observed. By comparing images shown in Figure 4D–F collected
at higher magnifications, it is readily seen that particle surfaces
become more distorted and corrugated following treatment at higher
pyrolysis temperatures. EDS analysis was also carried out for Co-500.
The following atomic composition was obtained: C (77.5%), N (10.8%),
Co (7.8%), and O (3.9%).

Figure 4 SEM images for Co-500 (A and D), Co-550 (B and
E), and Co-600 (C
and F).

To further probe morphological
differences of Co-500/550/600, and
more importantly, to reveal evolution of the Co particles as a function
of pyrolysis temperature, TEM was exploited at a few magnification
levels, as Figure 5 shows. Consistent with the SEM results, comparison among Figure 5A–C reveals
that the dodecahedral particle shapes are well preserved for Co-500/550,
but the particle corners decay considerably for Co-600. For the Co
particles (the dark spots in these images), it is readily observed
that average particle sizes increase with increasing pyrolysis temperature,
consistent with estimations using the Scherrer equation. At higher
magnifications, Figure 5D reveals that Co particles are largely uniform in Co-500, measuring
∼10 nm. Again, this is in agreement with estimations via the
Scherrer equation. As shown in Figure 5E, Co particle sintering becomes evident at the pyrolysis
temperature of 550 °C. At the highest pyrolysis temperature of
600 °C, some carbon nanotubes even develop, likely at the expense
of corner decay of the support particles as found in Figure 5C. To study Co particle surface
orientations, high-resolution TEM imaging was conducted on selected
Co particles. Figure 6 presents the Co particle size distribution obtained from the TEM
images (Figure 5),
and the average sizes are listed in Table 3, which are 8.9, 10.4, and 17.1 for Co-500,
550, and 600, respectively. This is consistent with the particle sizes
calculated from XRD peaks (11.5, 13.9, and 21.5 nm, respectively).
For both particles embedded in the carbon matrix (Figure 7A) and the ones located at
the external surfaces (Figure 7B), the primary exposed facet is (111) as determined using
fast Fourier transform calculations. This result does not suggest
that a surface oxide layer is absent on the Co particles. It does
suggest, however, that if a surface oxide layer exists, it grows commensurately
along the (111) orientation of the Co particles.

On the
basis of the characterizations shown above, our Co-T materials
can be qualitatively described as Co nanoparticles embedded in a carbon
matrix (a small portion of the Co particles are not embedded and stay
on the surface). Elemental analysis from EDS, however, demonstrates
that besides Co and C, N and O are also present in these materials.
To obtain more details on the nature of the carbon support and the
Co active phase, XPS was carried out next. For the sake of brevity,
only results for the Co-500 material are presented. Figure 8 depicts C 1s, N 1s, O 1s,
and Co 2p XPS spectra for Co-500. As shown in Figure 8a, the C 1s spectrum contains three features
with BE of 284.6, 285.7, and 286.6 eV, which are readily assigned
to carbon in C–C/C=C, C–N/C=N and C–O,
respectively.42Figure 8b displays the N 1s spectrum, where bands
at 398.7, 399.4, 400.5, and 401.5 eV are attributed to pyridinic N,
Co–N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively.43 Note that the N/C atomic ratio in ZIF-67 is
1/2 based on the 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2) ligand composition. This ratio drops to ∼1/8 after
pyrolysis at 500 °C (from EDS analysis), suggesting that a majority
of imidazole rings are damaged during pyrolysis to release N. The
detection of graphitic N and N bonded to Co demonstrates that some
of the released N becomes dopant of the Co and graphite phases. However,
the presence of pyridinic and pyrrolic N indicates that some fragments
of the imidazole rings are maintained during pyrolysis. As exhibited
in Figure 8c, the main
O 1s band appears at 531.6 eV, which can be assigned to oxygen in
C–O.44 The weaker features at ∼530
and ∼533 eV can be attributed to oxygen in Co–O and
C=O, respectively.45 Oxygen in these
bonds likely originates from air. After pyrolysis, Co-500 has been
stored in open air during which both the carbon and Co phases have
access to oxygen. Finally, the Co 2p XPS spectrum is presented in Figure 8d. Via peak deconvolution,
four different Co features are derived. In the 2p3/2 region,
features with BE of 786.3, 781.8, 780.2, and 778.5 eV are attributed
to the satellite peak of Co 2p, Co2+, Co3+,
and metallic cobalt, respectively.46,47 It is important
to note that the weakness of the Co0 feature can indeed
only be rationalized by invoking the presence of a surface oxide layer,
apparently growing commensurately along the (111) direction as indicated
from TEM imaging (Figure 7). Such a surface oxide layer is too thin to have any XRD
(Figure 2) and Raman
(Figure 3) sensitivity.
The co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ may indicate
that this oxide layer is Co3O4-like; however,
the situation is further complicated by the fact that some Co also
coordinates with N as evidenced from the 399.4 eV N 1s XPS feature
from Co–N. Based on XRD, electron microscopy images and XPS
analyses shown above, it is not possible to provide further details
regarding the Co particle surface structures. Next, NO adsorption
and desorption chemistries are described.

3.3 Chemistries
Involved in NO Storage and Release
Note at the onset of this
section that during our ambient temperature
NO trapping measurements, NO2 release has never been observed.
Therefore, the 2NO + O2 = 2NO2 reaction can
be safely excluded. The NO adsorption chemistry was first examined
with XPS. Figure 9a,b
presents the N 1s and O 1s spectra of Co-500 following NO saturation
at 25 °C. In comparison to the corresponding spectra prior to
NO adsorption, the evolution of N 1s band at 406.7 eV and O 1s band
at 532.7 eV clearly points to the formation of NO3–.48,49 This notion is further corroborated
by FTIR measurements, as displayed in Figure S4. After NO adsorption, a sharp IR band appears at 1384 cm–1, which is readily assigned to nitrate species.13 In contrast, C 1s and Co 2p XPS spectra before and after
NO adsorption barely display any difference; therefore, the corresponding
spectra after NO saturation are only displayed in Figure S5. Quantification of Co species via peak deconvolution,
however, does suggest that a small portion of Co2+ (∼3–4%
of total XPS detectable Co) is oxidized to Co3+ during
NO adsorption (Table 4). Because such quantifications are achieved via peak fitting, a
process that may introduce rather large errors, the reliability of
this finding awaits proof from further characterizations.

Figure 10 presents
NOx TPD following Co-500 saturation with NO at ambient temperature.
Although NO2 evolution is frequently observed upon surface
nitrate decomposition, interestingly, NO is the only NOx species that
desorbs here. NO desorption occurs in two states: a weak, shoulder
peak at ∼130 °C and a major desorption state at ∼190
°C. Because no molecular NO adsorption was observed via FTIR
(Figure S4), both desorption states are
attributed to NO release from surface nitrate decomposition. Following
the TPD process, the regenerated Co-500 sample was subjected to XRD,
XPS, FTIR, Raman spectroscopic analyses, and TEM imaging to reveal
changes of the morphological and physicochemical properties. XRD,
FTIR, and TEM reveal little difference between fresh and used samples.
The results are displayed in the Supporting Information, that is, Figures S4, S6, and S7. In contrast, XPS and Raman spectroscopic
analyses reveal important changes worth detailed discussions as follows.

Figure 10 TPD
of NOx from NO saturated Co-500.

As shown in Figure 11, a new Raman band appears at 681 cm–1 after
one
cycle of NO adsorption–desorption, which can be attributed
to Co3O4.50 This
notion is further corroborated by XPS analysis. After one cycle of
NO adsorption–desorption, both the intensity increase of the
O 1s band at ∼530 eV (Figure 12a, attributed to Co–O) and the intensity decrease
of the Co0 band at 778.5 eV (Figure 12b) suggest Co3O4 formation.
Therefore, the Co 2p peak fitting result shown in Table 4 appears to be reliable that
during ambient temperature NO adsorption, some Co2+ sites
are indeed oxidized to Co3+, leading to stoichiometric
Co3O4 formation.

surface Co sites that are capable of NO and O2 adsorption.
In this proposal, pathway (2) represents the primary, reversible NO
storage-release mechanism and pathway (3) causes irreversible Co oxidation,
which eventually leads to Co3O4 generation.

3.4 Stability and Reuse
Figure 13 presents NO storage results
for Co-500 in 5 repeated adsorption–desorption cycles. It is
readily seen that NO storage capacity keeps declining during repeated
use. For example, 100% NO trapping lasts for more than 15 h in the
first use; however, the duration drops to 11 h in the fifth use. In
comparison to NO trapping results shown in Figure 1b, the NO storage capacity for Co-500 after
5 uses is still comparable to that of the fresh Co-550. For the latter
material, the lower NO storage capacity as compared to fresh Co-500
is likely due to Co particle sintering (Figure 5). It can be suggested, therefore, that the
carbon matrix plays a role of stabilizing the Co particles, particularly
the ones that are embedded, during the NO adsorption–desorption
cycles. Even so, the deactivation rate found in Figure 13 is likely still too rapid
for practical applications. The main cause for deactivation is not
clear at this time. Co3O4 formation is a possible
one based on XPS results (Figure 12). However, other changes, for example, Co particle
sintering and Co surface structural changes can also lead to NO storage
performance loss. Even though the Co-500 material at the current stage
appears to be not stable enough for practical ambient NO trapping
applications, it does own a few desirable features, for example, low
cost, low toxicity, and easiness of synthesis to warrant further investigations.
We are currently working toward pinpointing the deactivation causes
and solutions to their prevention. Furthermore, it is anticipated
that both the Co particle size and the matrix composition will play
certain roles in stabilizing this type of materials. Work is also
planned on using other Co-containing MOFs to generate new NOx trapping
materials and to compare with the materials used in the present study.

4 Conclusions
Pyrolysis of M-MOF (ZIF-67) materials (M = Co, Ni, and Zn) in a
nitrogen atmosphere is applied to generate materials for low-concentration
NO removal from air at ambient temperature. The nature of the transition
metals used to prepare these materials is critical for NO trapping,
where materials containing Co are much more efficient than those containing
Ni and Zn. Pyrolysis temperature is found to influence NO trapping
capacity. The Co-MOF sample pyrolyzed at 500 °C exhibits the
best NO trapping efficiency, maintaining 100% low-concentration (10
ppm) NO adsorption efficiency for more than 15 h under a high flow
rate of 12 000 mL g–1 h–1. Via XRD, FTIR, Raman, and XPS spectroscopic studies and SEM and
TEM imaging, the active phase for NO adsorption is suggested to be
Co nanoparticles with a thin oxide layer embedded in the carbon matrix.
NO is found to adsorb in the form of surface nitrates, which decompose
to release NO upon thermal treatment. The NO trapping efficiency decreases
with repeated NO adsorption–desorption cycles. Co3O4 formation during such cycles is a possible reason for
deactivation.
