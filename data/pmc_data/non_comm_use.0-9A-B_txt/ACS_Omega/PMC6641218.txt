Development
of room-temperature gas sensors is a much sought-after
aspect that has fostered research in realizing new two-dimensional
materials with high surface area for rapid response and low-ppm detection
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, a fast-response and
low-ppm ethanol gas sensor operating at near room temperature has
been fabricated successfully by utilizing cubic mesoporous graphitic
carbon nitride (g-CN, commonly known as g-C3N4), synthesized through template inversion of mesoporous silica, KIT-6.
Upon exposure to 50 ppm ethanol at 250 °C, the optimized Ag/g-CN
showed a significantly higher response (Ra/Rg = 49.2), fast response (11.5 s),
and full recovery within 7 s in air. Results of sensing tests conducted
at 40 °C show that the sensor exhibits not only a highly selective
response to 50 ppm (Ra/Rg = 1.3) and 100 ppm (Ra/Rg = 3.2) of ethanol gas but also highly reversible
and rapid response and recovery along with long-term stability. This
outstanding response is due to its easily accessible three-dimensional
mesoporous structure with higher surface area and unique planar morphology
of Ag/g-CN. This study could provide new avenues for the design of
next-generation room-temperature VOC sensors for effective and efficient
monitoring of alarming concern over indoor environment.

Introduction
The quench of realizing
highly sensitive, fast response/recovery,
and selective gas sensors that can operate at room temperature for
detecting trace concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
in indoor climate has always fostered the development of novel synthesis
routes and new materials.1,2 Ethanol is one of the
kinds of beverage VOC present in alcoholic drinks (beer, wine, whiskey,
liquors, spirits, etc.) in diluted form.3,4 The detection
of the concentration of ethanol in breath, blood, or urine facilitates
prosecuting drunk drivers.5−7 In addition, the quantitative
detection of ethanol in human breath can be utilized as breath marker
for specific diseases.3−5 Ethanol is also used as an industrial solvent, and
its vapors are released in air during the production of chemical compounds
such as lacquers, aerosols, cleaning/mouthwash products, polishes,
surface coatings, dyes, inks, pesticides, preservatives, explosives,
and petrol additives.8,9 Ethanol is a central nervous system
depressant and affects brain, brainstem, and spinal cord when inhaled
or consumed. Exposure to ethanol leads to stupor, nausea, mental excitement
or depression, vomiting, loss of coordination (ataxia), sleepiness,
narcosis, impaired perception, lack of coordination, and death.10,11 Considering the harmful effects of the potential exposure of ethanol
gas on human, much efforts have been invested in the development of
low-cost, highly sensitive, selective, and durable ethanol sensors,
which can precisely recognize and detect ethanol gas when operating
at room temperature as well as result in significantly fast response
and recovery.12−14

Recently, explosive growth of interest in generating
novel two-dimensional
(2D) materials because of their high surface-to-volume ratio, quantum
hall effect at room temperature, high electron transfer rate, and
excellent thermal stability has stimulated their use in a variety
of applications, such as energy-storage devices, catalysis, and chemical
sensors.15,16 Graphitic carbon nitrides (g-CNs, commonly
known as g-C3N4) are a metal-free polymeric
semiconductor consisting of tri-s-triazine building
blocks with structure analogous to that of 2D layered graphite.17−20 Owing to its exciting physicochemical properties, appropriate band
gap, and excellent thermal/chemical stability, g-CN has been extensively
explored in photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, fuel cell, bioimaging,
and sensing applications.15−19 However, in conventional g-CN, the high degree of polycondensation
of monomeric heptazine units results in a very low surface area (<10
m2/g), which restricts its use in designing highly responsive
gas sensors. Recently, our group has demonstrated superior relative
humidity (RH)-sensing performance using hybridized g-CN nanocomposite
in 11–98% RH range.16 Generally,
high specific surface area (SSA) is the basic and foremost requirement
for a gas sensor to exhibit high sensitivity, reversible response
with rapid response/recovery, and long-term stability.21−23 An improvement in the SSA of g-CN could promote quick adsorption,
facile transmission, and rapid diffusion of analyte gas molecules
and carrier mobility on the surface of gas sensors. Ordered mesoporous
nanostructured materials offering large SSA and a high surface-to-volume
ratio not only enhance the sensing performances by providing high
surface permeability and ample surface reaction sites for faster gas
diffusion through their porous structure but also regulate the arrangement
of dopant nanoparticles in their periodic nanopores, thereby improving
the sensitivity and response/recovery time of the sensor.24−27

So far, a variety of techniques, including hard templates
like
silica (SBA-15, KIT-6) and alumina and carbon nitride precursors like
cyanamide and dicyandiamide, have been employed to produce mesoporous
g-CN for diverse applications.28−31 Lee et al. synthesized cubic mesoporous g-CN using
KIT-6 silica as hard template and utilized it for the selective detection
of metal ions. Because of its high surface area and induced affinity
to bind with metal ions, the mesoporous g-CN chemosensor shows a high
sensitivity to Cu2+ ions among other metal ions.28 Also the research work of Goettmann et al. was
focused on the synthesis of mesoporous g-CN (SSA = 439 m2/g) using colloidal silica nanoparticles as template. They observed
a remarkably high catalytic activity toward benzene with hexanoyl
chloride in the Friedel–Crafts reactions.29 Wang et al. developed mesoporous g-CN as a metal-free photocatalyst,
which can work under visible light, and demonstrated high-efficiency
hydrogen production by photochemical water reduction.30 Similarly, Kailasam et al. synthesized stacked mesoporous
g-CN by condensing cyanamide and silica together, followed by the
removal of silica. The reported material illustrates improved photocatalytic
activity for the production of hydrogen from water.31

Considering the highly promising prospects due to
the enhanced
surface area and ordered pore channels for a diverse range of applications,
exciting opportunities can be explored for the development of highly
sensitive/selective, durable VOC sensors with short response and recovery
that can operate at near room temperature. In the past, researchers
have devoted much effort in exploring the response of ethanol sensors
at low operating temperatures (<100 °C). Chen et al. synthesized
a SnO2/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructure and demonstrated
ethanol sensing in the temperature range of 43–276 °C.
They observed a response (Ra/Rg) of 7.6 for 100 ppm ethanol gas at 43 °C. However,
the sensor exhibits slow response/recovery (24/6 min) at 43 °C.13 Similarly, Shao et al. synthesized highly ordered
nanoporous Sb–SnO2 thin films and demonstrated sensitivity
toward ethanol at 100 °C. They observed a response (Ra/Rg) of 30.8 for 50 ppm ethanol
gas along with response and recovery times of 54 and 58 s, respectively.14 Therefore, the technological advantages of using
ethanol sensors under ambient conditions have always prompted constant
efforts in addressing the challenges in designing low-working-temperature
sensors.

In the present study, we have utilized a mesoporous
Ag/g-CN system
for the selective detection of trace levels of VOCs commonly present
in indoor climate when operating under near-room-temperature conditions.
Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been chosen for their outstanding electronic
conductivity in enhancing the sensitivity, selectivity, and response/recovery
time of chemical/biological sensors.12,16,19 Mesoporous Ag/g-CN synthesized by templated inversion
of three-dimensional (3D) cubic mesoporous silica (KIT-6) shows not
only excellent response and selectivity to ethanol gas at room temperature
but also rapid response/recovery, excellent stability, highly reversible
response, and cross-sensitivity from other interfering VOCs, including
acetone, formaldehyde, isopropanol, benzyl alcohol, and ethyl acetate.
The present strategy offers new avenues for the development of next-generation
high-performance VOC sensors, which can efficiently detect trace concentrations
when operating at near room temperature using mesoporous g-CN materials.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) results of
as-prepared samples in the 2θ range of 10–70° are
shown in Figure 1.
As can be observed, a broad peak centered at 2θ = 22° for
the mesoporous KIT-6 template, which can be denoted as the fingerprint
peak for the amorphous materials.32 For
CN-based samples, two clear and distinct peaks were observed at 2θ
= 12.5 and 27.5° (JCPDS no.: 087-1526) for the (100) and (002)
crystal planes of CN, respectively, which can be related to the regular
arrangement within the tri-s-triazine sheets and
the stacking of aromatic heptazine sheets, respectively.19 For the Ag(X)/meso-CN nanocomposites, three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 38.1, 44.2,
and 64.3° were observed. These peaks of silver correspond to
the (111), (200), and (220) planes of metallic Ag(0) nanoparticles
(JCPDS no.: 04-0783) with face-centered cubic symmetry and space group Fm3̅m.12 Further, the intensity of the Ag(0) reflection peaks increases gradually
with the increase of Ag concentration. Small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) patterns of all of the samples in the 2θ range of 0.5–3°
are shown in Figure S1. As can be seen,
well-resolved Bragg reflection at 2θ = 0.84° corresponding
to the (211) plane was observed for pure KIT-6 template. Additionally,
two shoulder peaks were observed in the 2θ region of 1–2°,
demonstrating the cubic Ia3d symmetry
and long-range pore ordering of the mesoporous structure of the KIT-6
template.32 The samples (meso-CN and Ag(X)/meso-CN) prepared
using KIT-6 as hard template also show a sharp peak centered at 2θ
∼ 0.84°, akin to the one revealed by mesoporous KIT-6.
However, the absence of shoulder peaks accounts for the reduction
in mesoporous ordering of the nanocasted samples.28 Furthermore, a slight positive shift in the (211) reflection
peak to higher angles (with reference to the (211) peak for the KIT-6
template) was observed in the nanocasted samples. This could be due
to the decrease in the X-ray scattering contrast between pore channels
and the mesoporous framework and is also validated from the decreasing
pattern in the pore diameters (Table 1 and Figure S2) for the
nanocasted samples.12,16,28

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of KIT-6 template, meso-CN, and Ag(X)/meso-CN samples are shown in Figure 2. The KIT-6 template exhibits type IV isotherms and
H1-type hysteresis loops, which, according to the IUPAC classification,
are related to the characteristic capillary condensation within the
uniform ordered mesopore channels.21,33 A sharp increment
beyond P/P0 > 0.6
demonstrates
the highly mesoporous nature and a narrow pore size distribution for
KIT-6. Nanocasted meso-CN and Ag(X)/meso-CN samples show type IV isotherms along with
a H3-type hysteresis loop, attributed to the large interparticle porosity
and irregular pores.21 The conventional
g-CN is nonporous, with a total surface area of ∼11 m2/g. The pore size distribution curves of KIT-6, meso-CN, and Ag(X)/meso-CN samples
are shown in Figure S2. For the nanocasted
samples (meso-CN and Ag(X)/meso-CN), the removal of silica template causes a corresponding
systematic reduction of pore diameter. As observed, the pore diameter
of Ag(1)/meso-CN was less than that of meso-CN because of the pore blockage caused by 1% Ag dopant nanoparticles.
Thereafter, the pore diameter systematically decreases due to further
loading of Ag NPs in meso-CN. However, the sensing
response (discussed later) does not directly depend on the surface
area and pore diameter of the samples. The SSA, pore size, wall thickness,
and pore volume are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, the wall thickness of the
nanocasted samples matches closely with the pore diameter of KIT-6,
which also reveals the successful replication of the nanocasted samples
from the mesoporous KIT-6 template.16,19,28,29

To gain a deep insight of the
morphology and dispersion of Ag NPs
in the mesopores, the KIT-6 template and the nanocasted Ag(3)/meso-CN nanocomposite were further explored by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and elemental mapping by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The HRTEM images in Figure 3a–c exhibit a well-ordered
array of the long range of mesoporous channels, confirming the regular
3D mesostructure of KIT-6.32 The replication
of mesoporous channels was observed in Figure 3d–f for the nanocasted Ag(3)/meso-CN nanocomposite templated from KIT-6. However, a reduced
ordering in the mesoporous structure of the nanocomposite can be observed,
which is also revealed by the SAXS data (Figure S1). Data regarding distribution of C, N, and Ag in the Ag(3)/meso-CN nanocomposite were obtained from the elemental mapping
of the SEM image (inset of Figure 3f), which itself shows clusters of rods with a relatively
uniform size of ca. 1–2 μm. As can be observed, Ag(0)
nanoparticles were found to be distributed uniformly throughout the
Ag(3)/meso-CN nanocomposite. The results of the experimental
loading of Ag wt % in meso-CN are illustrated in Table 1.

Gas-Sensing Properties
Generally, n-type materials
exhibit excellent sensing response when exposed to reducing gases.22−28 This happens when the chemisorbed oxygen ions on the surface of
the material react with the reducing gases: the bound electrons (e–) are released back to the conduction band of the material,
thereby leading to an increase in the conductivity of the material.24−26 The responses of g-CN, meso-CN, and Ag(X)/meso-CN nanocomposites toward 50 ppm
ethanol gas were measured in the temperature range of 40–400
°C (Figure 4A). The response for all of the materials
increases monotonically with an increase in the operating temperature
from 150 to 400 °C, attains a maximum value at 250 °C, and
decreases with further increase in the operating temperature. This
could be due to the fact that at low operating temperatures (<250
°C) the energy is not sufficient to activate the chemical reaction
between the ethanol molecules and at high temperatures (>250 °C)
the gas molecules have inclination to escape from the chemical reactions.34−40 The meso-CN (R = 26.5) nanocomposite
shows almost double response than that of conventional g-CN (R = 14.3) at 250 °C. As expected, the response increases
with the loading of Ag NPs in the meso-CN nanocomposite
and a maximum response (R) of 49.2 was obtained for
Ag(3)/meso-CN, which was 1.85, 1.2, and 1.4 times
higher than that of sensors based on pure meso-CN
(R = 26.5), Ag(1)/meso-CN (R = 42.9), and Ag(5)/meso-CN (R = 36.4), respectively, at 250 °C; hence, this temperature was
used in further sensing investigations. It was also observed that
with a decrease in operating temperature (<100 °C), the response
of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor to 50 ppm ethanol gas
decreases dramatically; however, the gas could be detected at a temperature
close to room temperature (40 °C). Responses of 1.3, 2.4, 4.9,
7.1, and 11.1 were obtained at temperatures of 40, 55, 70, 85, and
100 °C, respectively. These excellent sensing results obtained
from the unique combination of physicochemical properties originated
from the 3D cubic mesoporous structure and excellent catalytic activity
of Ag NPs within the pores. Interestingly, the sample response to
ethanol does not seem to vary directly with the surface area or pore
diameter irrespective of the fact that the morphology of the nanocasted
samples is highly related to the surface area and porosity attributes.
Sample Ag(1)-meso-CN (R = 42.9 at
250 °C) has less surface area but shows better response (1.62
times) than pure meso-CN (R = 26.5
at 250 °C) to 50 ppm ethanol gas, as some of the surface area
of the latter was sacrificed to provide space for highly conducting
Ag NPs, which in turn significantly increases the response of the
Ag(1)-meso-CN material. Contrarily, the decrease
in the sensing response with increasing (3–5 wt %) Ag concentration
in meso-CN could be due to the blockage of pore channels
of mesoporous meso-CN with Ag NPs. This pore blockage
reduces the possibility of Ag NPs to impregnate the pore channels
of meso-CN, thus causing an obstacle in the transmission
of charge carriers across the mesoporous channels.

materials to 50 ppm ethanol gas at

response and recovery curve of Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor
to 50 ppm ethanol gas at 250 °C.

Figure 4B
shows
the response of pure g-CN, meso-CN, and Ag(X)/meso-CN nanocomposites for ethanol gas
in the concentration range of 1–500 ppm at an operating temperature
of 250 °C. As can be seen, the Ag(3)/meso-CN-based
sensor shows comparatively higher response to ethanol gas in the 1–500
ppm concentration range than all other materials employed in this
study. The inset in Figure 4B shows excellent linearity in response for the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor even in the 1–50 ppm concentration
range. Figure 4C shows
the response of the sensor toward varying concentration of test VOCs
(ethanol, acetone, formaldehyde, isopropanol, benzyl alcohol, and
ethyl acetate) at 250 °C. As can be seen, the response of the
Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor increases monotonically with
the tested VOC concentration range of 1–500 ppm. The response
of the sensor to ethanol gas was comparatively higher in the entire
concentration range, which might be due to easier oxidation of the
hydroxyl groups at 250 °C.34−37

Figure 4D shows
the response of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor toward varied
concentration of ethanol (1–100 ppm) measured over a temperature
range of 40–250 °C. As can be seen, a very little response
was observed toward 1 ppm ethanol gas at <100 °C, which increases
with increase in temperature. Nevertheless, with the increase in ethanol
concentration from 5 to 100 ppm, the response increases monotonically
from the lower medium temperature range (100 °C) to 250 °C.
From near room temperature (40 °C) to 100 °C, the rate of
increase in response for the entire concentration range was slow,
which might be due to poor dehydrogenation of ethanol gas at lower
operating temperatures. Under mild heating, the sensor is also able
to detect 20 ppm (R = 1.23 at 55 °C) and 10
ppm (R = 1.24 at 70 °C) ethanol gas, confirming
its excellent sensitivity. After amplification of these signals through
electronic circuitry, the sensor can be used to locate ethanol vapors
at lower operating temperatures.

The transient response/recovery
time is the important attribute
of a sensor to determine its application in real-time environment. Figure 4E shows the response
and recovery curves of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor to
varying concentrations (1–50 ppm) of ethanol at 250 °C
under both dry and humid (90% RH) ambient. Under the dry ambient,
the sensor response increases linearly with increasing ethanol concentration
and responses of 1.99, 4.2, 8.98, 18.6, 27.2, 38.6, and 49.2 were
obtained for 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 ppm, respectively. Response
and recovery times of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensors were
estimated by the time taken to reach 90% of the final and initial
resistances for adsorption and desorption, respectively.38−42 Ethanol adsorption–desorption curves show that the sensor
exhibits excellent reversibility toward detecting ethanol gas when
rapidly switched to the ethanol and air atmosphere. Moreover, the
sensor reverts to its initial state very quickly during the process
of desorption in the entire concentration range. The response time
varied in the range of 8–12 s, whereas the recovery time was
observed in the range of 3–7 s. The results also conclude that
the sensor took less time to resume its initial state and became readily
available for the next measurement. For real-time applications, such
as in drunken driving cases, it is highly desirable to measure the
sensor response to ethanol under high humid conditions (>85% RH).
Considering that the exhaled breath gases are composed of high amount
of water vapor, comparative tests for mesoporous Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor toward ethanol response were also carried out at 90% RH.
The dynamic response characteristics of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor in Figure 4E showed good response to ethanol (R = 1.56 and
29.4 for 1 and 50 ppm, respectively) in humid ambient (90% RH). Under
humid conditions, hydroxyl groups (−OH) are formed on the sensor
surface instead of chemisorbed oxygen species, which causes a decrease
in ethanol response under high humid conditions.6,7 The
results also indicate that the mesoporous Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor material is suitable for real-time practical applications.

A single loop of ethanol response–recovery behavior of the
Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor to 50 ppm ethanol gas at 250
°C in Figure 4F shows fast response and recovery times of 11 and 5.5 s, respectively.
A comparison with other ethanol sensors based on metal oxides having
mesoporous or 2D sheetlike structure (Table 2) shows that our sensor possesses faster
response and recovery at relatively lower working temperature. Figure S3A shows the single-loop response/recovery
curve for the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor toward detecting
1 ppm ethanol gas at 250 °C. A response of 1.98 was observed
(Figure S3a) along with fast response (τres = 11.8 s) and recovery (τrec = 5 s) times. Figure S3B shows the response and recovery curves
of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor for varying concentrations
(50–500 ppm) of ethanol at 40 °C. As can be seen, the
sensor response increases linearly with increasing ethanol concentration
and the response and recovery times varied in the ranges of 6–9
and 3–5 min, respectively. The inset image shows the single-loop
response/recovery curve for the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor
toward detecting 50 ppm ethanol gas at 40 °C. A response of 1.3
was observed along with satisfactory response (τres = 580 s) and rapid recovery (τrec = 300 s) times.
The result shows that the sensor was able to detect ethanol vapors
even under near-room-temperature conditions. Figure S3C shows the response of the pure g-CN, meso-CN, and Ag(X)/meso-CN nanocomposites
for ethanol gas in the concentration range of 10–1500 ppm at
an operating temperature of 40 °C. As can be seen, almost negligible
response was shown by all of the samples up to 200 ppm ethanol gas,
after which the Ag(3)/meso-CN sample started showing
a little response, which increases linearly beyond 500 ppm ethanol
gas concentration. The selectivity of the as-prepared samples to 100
ppm test gases at 40 °C is shown in Figure S3D. As can be seen, the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor
shows better response to ethanol gas among all other mesoporous materials,
a little response to acetone and formaldehyde, and almost negligible
response to 100 ppm isopropanol, benzyl alcohol, and ethyl acetate
at 40 °C. To determine the dynamic response and recovery of the
Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor toward rapid variation of adsorption
and desorption, the sensor was exposed to 50 ppm ethanol gas and air
in four loops at 250 °C (Figure S4). The response–recovery curves show that the sensor exhibits
a highly reversible nature, and the response of the sensor returned
to the baseline quickly as soon as fresh air was blown into the chamber,
recommending an excellent reversibility of the sensor response to
ethanol. Figure S5 shows the response and
recovery times of g-CN, meso-CN, and Ag(X)/meso-CN (X = 1, 3, and 5) sensors
toward the detection of 1 and 50 ppm ethanol gas at 250 °C. The
results illustrate that the Ag(3)/meso-CN-based sensor
responds quicker toward the detection of both 1 and 50 ppm ethanol
gas than other sensors under similar measurement conditions.

The response–recovery
times of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor toward detection
of 50 ppm test VOC at 250 °C are
shown in Figure S6. As can be observed,
a significantly lower response–recovery time (11.5/7 s) was
obtained for the detection of 50 ppm ethanol gas compared to that
of acetone (24/15 s), formaldehyde (32.5/16 s), isopropanol (38/19
s), benzyl alcohol (40/15 s), and ethyl acetate (54/23 s). The results
show that the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor shows a rapid
response to ethanol gas under same testing conditions. Also, it was
observed that the sensor took less time to recover (compared with
response time) to its original state for all of the gases. This could
be due to the cubic mesoporosity accessible as well as the stacked
sheets of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor, which allows
the gas molecules to rapidly desorb from its surface especially with
ethanol compared with other gases. The long-term stability of the
sensor is an important parameter to determine its applicability in
commercial devices. Figure S7 shows the
response of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor to ethanol gas
over a span of 5 weeks. During this measurement period, the sensor
shows a good stability and almost a constant response was observed,
which shows excellent stability of the mesoporous Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor.

The selectivity of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor among
other as-prepared samples to 50 ppm test gases at 250 °C is shown
in Figure 5. As can
be seen, the sensor shows a significant response toward ethanol gas
among all other sensors. The response to ethanol gas (R = 49.2) was 3.06, 3.94, 5.4, 7.8, and 12.3 times higher than that
to acetone (R = 16.1), formaldehyde (R = 12.5), isopropanol (R = 9.12), benzyl alcohol
(R = 6.3), and ethyl acetate (R =
4.01) gases under same test conditions. Recognizing a particular gas
is an important attribute of any gas sensor showing its selectivity
for particular gas detection in any mixture of gases. Therefore, the
sensor was exposed to random VOC test gases (50 ppm) at 250 °C
over a period of time. As can be seen in Figure 6, the sensor recovers its original state
once fresh air is passed into the chamber. To quantify the selectivity
of the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor against other test gases,
the ratios of the response to 50 ppm ethanol to that toward other
test gases were calculated and plotted (Figure 6 inset). The higher the value of relative
sensitivity (RS = Sethanol/Stest gas), the better the selectivity of the sensor.49 From the results, we can observe that the values
of RS for all of the interfering test gases is >3, indicating that
the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor exhibited excellent selectivity
to ethanol gas.

Ethanol-Sensing Mechanism
The fundamental gas-sensing
mechanism of n-type semiconductor materials is primarily linked to
the change in electrical conductivity due to the adsorption/desorption
of target gas and oxygen molecules on their surfaces.22−27,36−40 Mesoporous n-type materials because of their enhanced
surface area and ordered, long-range/uniform pore channels enhance
surface active sites, which ultimately leads to rapid adsorption,
facile propagation, and quick desorption of analyte gas molecules
within and on the sensor surface.25,38−42 In this study, when the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor is
exposed to hot air in a gas chamber at 250 °C, the oxygen molecules
in the air get adsorbed on the surface of the sensor and trap free
electrons (e–) from the conduction band of n-type
g-CN, causing the formation of negatively charged oxygen species (O–, O2–, O2–, and O22–). This process of trapping
of e– forms a depletion region on the sensor surface,
resulting in an increase in sensor resistance.50−52 The analyte
gas molecules preferentially adsorb on these oxygen sites. As the
Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor is exposed to ethanol gas, the
surface of the sensor gets oxidized by reactive oxygen species and
e– are released back to the conduction band of g-CN,
resulting in an increase in the conductivity of the sensor. A schematic
of the gas-sensing mechanism of the Ag/meso-CN sensor
is shown in Figure 7. A typical band energy diagram for the Ag/meso-CN
sensor in the presence of ethanol gas is illustrated in Figure 8. In the semiconductor-based
materials, the transfer of electrons between constituting materials
is dependent on their respective work functions (WF),12,26,36−39 wherein the difference in WF leads to
the formation of a potential barrier and the electrons move from materials
possessing lower WF to that with higher WF to form a new Fermi energy level.36−41 In the Ag/meso-CN sensor, due to the lower WF of g-CN (4.3 eV)19 than Ag (4.7 eV),12 the electrons get
transferred from the conduction band of g-CN to that of Ag by band
bending, resulting in the formation of a potential barrier. This potential
barrier hinders the transfer of electrons across the mesoporous sensor,
and the electrons present on the sensor surface become prominent sites
for the adsorption of oxygen species, which in turn significantly
increases the sensor response.37−39 According to this study, the
sensing performance significantly depends on the surface area of the
Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor, catalytic nature of Ag NPs,
and the physicochemical behavior of ethanol gas.

mechanism by Ag/meso-CN sensor.

in the presence of ethanol gas.

Effect of Mesoporosity
High surface area is an essential
prerequisite to achieve superior gas-sensing performances. The provision
of an enhanced surface area generates ample active sites for gas diffusion.
The sensor based on nanocasted mesoporous g-CN exhibits enhanced response
than that based on conventional g-CN. The mesoporous Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor possesses ordered structure, and the availability
of long, uniform, widely accessible mesoporous channels in all of
the directions facilitates quicker diffusion, smoother propagation,
and rapid desorption of ethanol molecules from the sensor surface,
thus causing the sensor to possess much improved response and excellent
response–recovery times. However, as observed from Table 1, the total surface
area of the prepared materials does not directly depend on the response
toward ethanol gas. The Ag(3)/meso-CN sample has
less surface area than pure meso-CN and Ag(1)/meso-CN but shows 1.9 and 1.15 times higher response to
ethanol gas, respectively. This could be due to the fact that some
of the mesoporosity was lost when loading Ag NPs in meso-CN, which results in significant improvement in the response of
the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor.

Dehydrogenation of Ethanol
Gas
The physicochemical
properties of the target gas along with its interaction with adsorbed
oxygen species on the sensor surface significantly influence the response
of the sensor.22,23 When the Ag(3)/meso-CN sensor is exposed to hot air in a chamber, the electrons are
consumed from the conduction band of the materials during the process
of adsorption of atmospheric oxygen on the sensor surface, resulting
in a decrease in the conductivity of the sensor, according to eq 1(26,27) 1  where Sads denotes the surface
adsorption site. Thereafter, when the sensor is exposed to ethanol
gas, it gets dehydrogenated on contacting with the sensor surface
and converted to acetaldehyde according to eq 2 and further reacts with 2O–ads or O2– to form CO2 and
H2O (eq 3)
as follows 2   3  Hence, the
ethanol gas removes the adsorbed
oxygen, frees up electrons, and increases the electrical conductivity
of the Ag/meso-CN sensor.

Role of Ag NPs
Ag NPs because of their excellent electrical
conductivity have been known to increase the response of n-type semiconductors.
The presence of Ag NPs accelerates the process of catalytic oxidation
and chemical sensitization, which increases active oxygen species
on the surface of meso-CN. Chemical sensitization
(spillover effect) of Ag NPs greatly enhances the adsorption–desorption
rate of molecular oxygen over the sensor surface and converts them
to oxygen ions (O–) with the help of e– species captured from the conduction band of g-CN. Also, the excellent
catalytic nature of Ag NPs encourages the breakdown of ethanol gas
molecules into active radicals, thereby increasing the interaction
between adsorbed surface oxygen ions and ethanol gas.12,53 Furthermore, because of their large Helmholtz double layer, the
metal nanoparticles become efficient electron sinks and hence Ag NPs
acquired a tendency to form Ag2O compound in air and accelerated
the formation of a more intense e– depleted layer
when extracting the e– from meso-CN.54 Besides, the lower work function
of meso-CN (4.32) than that of Ag (4.26) causes e– to move from the meso-CN to the Ag
NPs (Figure 8) and
leads to the formation of a negative-charge layer around the Ag and meso-CN interface.12,19 On exposure to reductive
ethanol gas, e– moves back to the meso-CN via redox reaction between Ag2O and Ag and hence the
regions adjacent to the Ag and meso-CN interface
become highly sensitive for ethanol gas detection. Therefore, the
presence of catalytic Ag(0) NPs generates more active oxygen species
and exhibits higher response to ethanol at lower operating temperature.

Conclusions
In summary, we report for the first time
the synthesis of ordered
mesoporous Ag/meso-CN using hard template of KIT-6
via the nanocasting process for the trace detection of ethanol at
near room temperature. We observed that the negatively replicated
cubic mesoporous g-CN (meso-CN) shows about twice
response to ethanol gas (50 ppm at 250 °C) than the conventional
g-CN. This is due to exceptionally higher surface area of meso-CN with uniform pore channels accessible through all
directions compared to that of conventional g-CN. The response to
ethanol gas further increases about twice that of meso-CN when 3 wt % Ag NPs were loaded to it. Compared to those of traditional
gas sensors based on semiconducting metal oxides, significantly higher
response (R = 49.2), faster response time (11.5 s),
quicker recovery (7 s), and better stability were observed to 50 ppm
ethanol. The sensor not only detects trace ethanol concentration (1
ppm) at 250 °C with response and recovery times of 10.5 and 2.5
s, respectively, but also shows excellent relative sensitivity (>3
times) toward detecting ethanol gas compared to that of measured test
VOCs. Interestingly, the response at near room temperature (40 °C)
shows that the sensor was also able to selectively detect 50 ppm (R = 1.3) and 100 ppm (R = 3.2) ethanol
gas among a variety of test VOCs. The excellent sensing response results
from the high surface area and the unique planar morphology of Ag/g-CN,
which facilitates the adsorption and diffusion and fastens the reaction
kinetics of ethanol molecules on its surface. We believe that the
demonstration of outstanding room-temperature sensing results in this
study holds promise for the accurate identification of harmful VOCs
present in indoor climate at room temperature and thus provides a
positive glimpse for futuristic miniaturized, handheld sensing devices
with superior gas-sensing attributes.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of Mesoporous Silica, KIT-6
Typically, Pluronic
P123 (2.0 g; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 70 mL of distilled water
and vigorously stirred (1200 rpm) at 40 °C for 1 h. HCl (2.75
mL, 35%; Fisher Scientific) was added to the above solution, and the
mixture was again stirred for 45 min. Thereafter, 1-butanol (2.5 mL;
Fisher Scientific) was added and stirred to obtain a clear transparent
solution. To this solution, tetraethoxy orthosilicate (4.6 mL; Sigma-Aldrich)
was added and further stirred for 24 h. The white gel product thus
obtained was autoclaved in a hydrothermal reactor at 100 °C for
24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the products were recovered,
washed, and dried at 80 °C. Finally, the recovered products were
calcined at 550 °C (heating rate, 2 °C/min) for 4 h to produce
KIT-6.

Mesoporous g-CN (meso-CN)
The mesoporous
g-CN was synthesized using as-prepared KIT-6 silica as hard template.
Initially, CH2N2 (cyanamide, 1 g; Sigma-Aldrich)
was dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water and then poured dropwise
in KIT-6 (0.5 g). The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 40 °C, followed
by drying in air at 80 °C for 3 h. The white powder was then
moved to a covered crucible and heated at 550 °C (heating rate,
2 °C/min) for 4 h. The obtained products were mixed with NH4HF2 (ammonium hydrogen difluoride, 2M, 50 mL; Sigma-Aldrich)
and stirred for 24 h. The bright yellow filtrate was washed with distilled
water and dried at 100 °C for 6 h to obtain ordered meso-CN nanostructures. Ordered mesoporous Ag-doped g-CN nanostructures
(Ag/meso-CN) were obtained by sequential addition
of an adequate amount of AgNO3 (silver nitrate; Fisher
Scientific) aqueous solution to the solution of cyanamide, and further
the same route was followed as utilized for the synthesis of meso-CN nanostructures. A series of optimizing experiments
were carried out with different weight ratios of Ag in Ag/meso-CN nanocomposite, and the prepared products at above-mentioned
ratios were denoted as Ag(X)/meso-CN, where X represents 1, 3, and 5 wt % ratios
of Ag NPs in meso-CN. Conventional g-CN was synthesized
by directly heating cyanamide according to the reported procedure.20

Characterization
The crystalline
phases of the materials
were evaluated by XRD using advance Bruker D8 diffractometer with
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA
in the 2θ range of 10–70°. SAXS data were recorded
at 2θ = 0.5–3° on SAXSess mc2 instrument
(Anton Paar) equipped with a high-performance charge-coupled device
detector. Nitrogen-sorption isotherms were collected using Autosorb
iQ2 instrument (Quantachrome) at 77 K. The samples were degassed overnight
under vacuum at 200 °C. The morphology of the samples was observed
using HRTEM instrument (JEOL) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
Quantitative information on the elemental composition was obtained
using SEM instrument (JSM-IT300; JEOL).

Gas-Sensing Measurement
Sensing measurements were performed
on Ag–Pd interdigitated substrates with five pairs of electrodes.
The procedure for sensor fabrication and gas-sensing experiments was
similar to that described in our previous study.12,24 To measure the sensor response under highly humid conditions, the
humidity level was maintained at 90% RH in the testing sensor chamber.
The resulting response (R = Ra/Rg) is the mean value obtained
from repeated experiments at a particular temperature.
