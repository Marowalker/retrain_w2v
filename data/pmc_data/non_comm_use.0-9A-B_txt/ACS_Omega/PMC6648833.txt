A methodological
survey of density functional theory (DFT) methods
for the prediction of UV–visible (vis)–near-infrared
(NIR) spectra of phthalocyanines is reported. Four methods, namely,
full time-dependent (TD)-DFT and its Tamm–Dancoff approximation
(TDA), together with their simplified modifications (sTD-DFT and sTDA,
respectively), were tested by using the examples of unsubstituted
and alkoxy-substituted metal-free ligands and zinc complexes. The
theoretical results were compared with experimental data derived from
UV–visible absorption and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy.
Seven popular exchange-correlation functionals (BP86, B3LYP, TPSSh,
M06, CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP, and ωB97X) were tested within these
four approaches starting at a relatively modest level using 6-31G(d)
basis sets and gas-phase BP86/def2-SVP optimized geometries. A gradual
augmentation of the computational levels was used to identify the
influence of starting geometry, solvation effects, and basis sets
on the results of TD-DFT and sTD-DFT calculations. It was found that
although these factors do influence the predicted energies of the
vertical excitations, they do not affect the trends predicted in the
spectral properties across series of structurally related substituted
free bases and metallophthalocyanines. The best accuracy for the gas-phase
vertical excitations was observed in the lower-energy Q-band region
for calculations that made use of range-separated hybrids for both
full and simplified TD-DFT approaches. The CAM-B3LYP functional provided
particularly accurate results in the context of the sTD-DFT approach.
The description of the higher-energy B-band region is considerably
less accurate, and this demonstrates the need for further advances
in the accuracy of theoretical calculations. Together with a general
increase in accuracy, the application of simplified TD-DFT methods
affords a 2–3 orders of magnitude speedup of the calculations
in comparison to the full TD-DFT approach. It is anticipated that
this approach will be widely used on desktop computers during the
interpretation of UV–vis–NIR spectra of phthalocyanines
and related macrocycles in the years ahead.

1 Introduction
The unique physical–chemical properties of phthalocyanines
(Pcs) paved the way for a wide range of applications, such as their
use as photosensitive optical and electronic materials in solar cells,
agents for photodynamic therapy and diagnosis, in memory storage devices,
as sensors, etc.1−10 This is enabled by the presence of unusually intense absorption
bands that lie at the red end of the visible region and into the near-infrared
(NIR) region (650–800 nm), which is referred to as the Q-band
in the context of Gouterman’s four-orbital model.11,12 In the context of phthalocyanines, the Q-band can be attributed
primarily to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) →
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO → LUMO
+ 1 transitions.13 Excitations from low-lying
orbitals to the LUMO and LUMO + 1 correspond to higher-energy bands,
including a weaker broad charge transfer (CT) band envelope in the
context of alkoxyphthalocyanines,14,15 and the B-bands
of Gouterman’s four-orbital model in the 350–450 nm
region.13 The optimization of the performance
of light-absorbing materials based on Pcs aims at fine-tuning the
positions of these bands to cover certain ranges of the electromagnetic
spectra and provide the required functionalities for practical applications.

Modern quantum chemistry affords valuable and powerful approaches
based on time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), which
is widely used for the interpretation of the UV–visible (vis)–near-infrared
(NIR) absorption spectra of colored inorganic, organic, coordination,
and organometallic compounds, including phthalocyanines and their
analogues.13,16−29 However, TD-DFT is known to have certain drawbacks, such as overestimation
of the excitation energies, appearance of low-energy “ghost”
states with low oscillator strengths, incorrect description of charge-transfer
processes, etc.30−34 Moreover, TD-DFT calculations are often time-consuming, so their
application for large molecular systems is typically limited by the
available computational facilities.

Therefore, over the last
decade, efforts have been made to eliminate
or at least to alleviate these drawbacks. To solve the problems of
overestimated excitation energies and ghost transitions, various functionals
were proposed, among them are range-separated hybrid functionals,
which contain a certain amount of Hartree–Fock exchange (CAM-B3LYP,
LC-BLYP, etc.). Some speedup can be achieved using Tamm–Dancoff
approximation (TDA);35,36 however, full TD-DFT calculations
typically yield more accurate transition dipole moments and hence
more accurate spectra.

One of the recent advances was the development
of the so-called
simplified TD-DFT (sTD-DFT) and simplified Tamm–Dancoff approximation
(sTDA) proposed by Grimme et al.,37−40 which is in line with the modern
trend of elaboration of quantum-chemical methods affordable even for
large molecules at relatively modest facilities, including desktop
computers.41−43

The reliability of sTDA and sTD-DFT methods
was proven through
a comparison of the experimental and calculated UV–visible
absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectra of several types of
compounds, including various dyes and pigments, fullerenes, helicenes,
etc. Importantly, these methods afforded a spectacular 2–3
orders of magnitude speedup in the calculations in comparison to conventional
TD-DFT treatments. This speedup is achieved in part by restricting
the configuration space to a user-specified energy range of excitations.
This means that all excited-state configurations that lie higher than
the threshold in energy will be neglected.

Thus, together with
its low computational cost, these new methodologies
became attractive for research purposes dealing with large systems,
including biomolecules.44 Currently, sTD-DFT
and sTDA are implemented in several quantum-chemistry packages, which
can be used in a “black-box” fashion by nonprofessionals
even on conventional desktop computers.

Herein, we report a
survey of the optimal simplified methods for
interpreting the spectral properties of phthalocyanines. Several popular
exchange-correlation functionals are used in conjunction with 6-31G(d)
basis sets to predict the Q-band regions of the UV–visible
spectra of phthalocyanines using gas-phase BP86/def2-SVP geometries.
Four different calculation methodologies, namely, TDA, TD-DFT, sTDA,
and sTD-DFT, are implemented with the ORCA 4.0.145,46 software package.

A series of different exchange-correlation
functionals were corrected,
including a pure generalized gradient approximation (GGA)—BP86,47,48 hybrid GGAs—B3LYP49 and TPSSh,50 meta-GGA—M06,51 and range-separated hybrids—CAM-B3LYP,52 LC-BLYP,52 and ωB97X.53 These functionals have been widely used to carry
out TD-DFT calculations of tetrapyrrolic macrocycles,54−63 and the benefits and drawbacks of their applications have been highlighted.

The initial set of calculations were performed at a relatively
modest level of theory using gas-phase BP86/def2-SVP optimized geometries
for the evaluation of excitation energies in the gas phase using a
series of different methods and functionals with 6-31G(d) basis sets.
Then, the level of the optimal computational protocol was gradually
augmented to further study the effects of starting geometry, solvation
effects, and basis sets on the results of the sTD-DFT calculations.

During the study, calculations were performed using the macrocycles
depicted in Chart 1; so the results could be compared with the data obtained for the
corresponding reference molecules, which have been characterized previously
by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy:(i) Unsubstituted phthalocyanines H2Pc and ZnPc whose predicted spectra were compared to those of well-soluble tetra-tert-butyl-substituted phthalocyanines.

(ii) Symmetrical peripherally substituted
octa-β-methoxyphthalocyanine and its zinc complex M[(β-MeO)8Pc] (M = 2H, Zn) modeling corresponding
octa-β-butoxyphthalocyanines.

(iii) Symmetrical nonperipherally substituted
octa-α-methoxyphthalocyanine and its zinc complex M[(α-MeO)8Pc] (M = 2H, Zn) modeling corresponding
octa-α-butoxyphthalocyanines.



Chart 1 Experimentally
Characterized and Model Phthalocyanines Used for Benchmark

These molecules were selected for use as model compounds
for the
following reasons:(i) To provide a comparison of calculated
spectra of symmetrical zinc complexes with the corresponding metal-free
ligands, which reveals the effects associated with the decrease of
molecular symmetry from D4h to D2h that results
in the characteristic splitting of Q-bands of metal-free ligands (Figure 1).64

(ii) The introduction
of the alkoxy groups
at the peripheral β-positions of the Pc macrocycle is known
to result in a relatively small bathochromic shift of the Q-band,
while substitution at nonperipheral α-positions provides a strong
bathochromic shift of this band by ca. 80 nm.14 The energies of the corresponding vertical excitations will be compared
to the experimental values. Moreover, the addition of alkoxy substituents
is known to give rise to additional bands in the 400–450 nm
region, associated with charge transfer (CT) transitions involving
low-lying molecular orbitals (MOs) that are localized on the peripheral
fused benzene rings and the lone pairs of oxygen atoms.14,15,64

In summary, the conclusions
that can be drawn from this can be
viewed as recommendations for how best to predict the properties of
novel phthalocyanines and related macrocycles, in a manner that can
pave the way to the rational design of light-harvesting chromophores
for optical applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Geometry Optimization
A previous
survey of the optimal methods for the TD-DFT interpretation of phthalocyanine
absorption spectra demonstrated that the starting geometry has only
a minor influence on the energies of vertical excitations.54 In the present work, we used the BP86 functional
with double- and triple-ζ def2-SVP and def2-TZVP basis sets,
respectively, with RIJCOSX acceleration as a compromise between the
need for accuracy and achieving a reasonable calculation speed. The
BP86 functional was chosen since it is known to provide highly accurate
geometries for tetrapyrrolic macrocycles. In some cases, this accuracy
exceeds the one provided by the frequently used B3LYP method.65−67 Solvation effects in chloroform were accounted for by using the
solvation model based on density (SMD).68 The obtained structures were verified to be local minima by subsequent
vibrational frequency calculations showing no imaginary frequencies.

While unsubstituted and β-MeO-substituted Pcs have almost
perfectly flat macrocyclic cores, the introduction of α-MeO
substituents creates steric crowding, which is released by the nonplanar
deformation of the macrocycle. This crowding was accounted for by
using Grimme’s atom-pairwise dispersion correction and Becke–Johnson
damping (D3BJ). Geometries, selected bond lengths, and angles with
designations of atoms for optimized molecules are given in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Front and side views
of the optimized geometries and selected geometrical
parameters for the model phthalocyanines optimized in gas phase at
the BP86/def2-SVP+D3BJ level. The values given in brackets are obtained
in gas phase at the BP86/def2-TZVP+D3BJ level.

The calculated geometrical parameters of the metal-free ligands
and their complexes follow similar general trends (Figure 2). In the metal-free ligands,
two isoindole units with the NH groups have C1′–C2′ and C2′–C2′
bonds that are elongated by ca. 0.01 Å in comparison to those
without NH groups, and the C1′–NH–C1′ angles are larger by ca. 5° in
comparison to the NH-proton-free isoindoles. In the case of zinc complexes,
these bonds and angles are equalized because of the equivalence of
the four isoindole moieties, and the angles formed by the C1 carbon atoms and the meso-nitrogen atom exhibit
minor differences of no more than 0.5–0.7°. The addition
of electron-donating β-MeO groups has a vanishingly small influence
on the geometries of H2[(β-MeO)8Pc] and Zn[(β-MeO)8Pc] macrocyclic
cores in comparison to H2Pc and ZnPc, respectively. The observed tendencies
correlate well with the results of X-ray diffraction studies.69,70

The basis sets selection was found to be relatively unimportant.
Using triple-ζ def2-TZVP basis sets did not result in significant
changes in the molecular geometries. The bond lengths systematically
contracted by less than 0.01 Å (Figure 2, values in brackets), and the trends observed
in the def2-SVP-optimized structures were completely preserved. Even
smaller changes in geometry were observed when solvation was taken
into consideration.

2.2 Origin of UV–Vis
Spectra of Phthalocyanines
The UV–visible absorption
spectra of phthalocyanines are
well-documented in the literature.71 These
spectra are dominated by the bands that are associated with the Q-
and B-transitions of Gouterman’s four-orbital model, which
are derived from the doubly degenerate frontier orbitals of a 16-atom
18-π-electron system arranged in an ML = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6, ±7,
eight sequence, due to the magnetic quantum number associated with
the circulation of electron density around the phthalocyanine ring.11,12 In the context of porphyrins,72 the MOs
derived from the HOMO and LUMO of the C16H162– parent hydrocarbon perimeter have ML = ±4 and ±5 angular nodal properties, respectively.
In the context of metal complexes with fourfold symmetry, the LUMO
retains its degeneracy for symmetry reasons and the MOs derived from
the HOMO remain accidentally near degenerate due to the effect of
incorporating the four pyrrole rings. This results in forbidden and
allowed ΔML = ±9 and ±1
transitions that give rise to the Q- and B-bands, respectively, since
an incident photon can only provide up to a single quantum of orbital
angular momentum.

A unified approach is needed for the nomenclature
used for the frontier π-MOs, which facilitates a comparison
of the results of the DFT calculations performed for phthalocyanines
and other porphyrinoids with differing symmetries. This can be readily
achieved by using Michl’s formalism for the MOs that are derived
from the HOMO and LUMO of the parent perimeter that display ML = ±4 and ±5 angular nodal properties.73−75 These are referred to as the a, s, –a, and −s MOs (Figure 3), based on whether the atoms
aligned with the y axis lie on a nodal plane (a/–a) or have large MO coefficients (s/–s). The a and s MOs are derived from the HOMO of the C16H182– parent hydrocarbon perimeter, while the –a and –s MOs are derived from
the LUMO. The Q- and B-bands can be viewed as arising from the cancelation
and addition of the electric dipole transition moments that are generated
by the one-electron transitions between the doubly degenerate HOMO
and the doubly degenerate LUMO. Near-equal a →
−a/–s and s → –a/–s contributions are typically
predicted for the Q- and B-bands of porphyrins.

on the examples of H2Pc and ZnPc calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level
for a gas-phase BP86/def2-SVP+D3BJ geometry.

When further structural modifications are made, the energies
of
the a, s, –a, and –s MOs depend on the nature of the macrocycle and structural
modifications that can be made, such as the incorporation of bridging
aza-nitrogens, the presence of peripheral fused rings and substituents,
and the metal ion inside its cavity.75 In
the context of phthalocyanines,13 the Q-band
predominantly involves the one-electron transitions between the a MO and the –a and –s MOs, as there is an unusually large splitting of the a and s MOs derived from the HOMO of the C16H182– parent hydrocarbon perimeter (the
ΔHOMO value in the context of Michl’s perimeter model73−75). Since there are four nodal planes and 16 atoms on the inner ligand
perimeter, the nodal planes of the two MOs lie on alternating sets
of atoms. The s MO, which has large MO coefficients on
the electronegative aza-nitrogen atoms, is stabilized, while the a MO with large MO coefficients on the eight carbon atoms
is destabilized, since the addition of peripheral fused benzene rings
adds an extra set of nodal planes. The large ΔHOMO value results
in the Q- and B-bands losing their forbidden and allowed character,
so the Q-band becomes the dominant spectral feature in a manner that
makes the phthalocyanine π-system suitable for use in applications
where a highly photostable dye is required that absorbs strongly at
the red end of the visible region and the near-infrared region. TD-DFT
calculations have been used to demonstrate that the ΔHOMO value
of porphyrinoids can be used to systematically predict their optical
and redox properties.

In the context of metal phthalocyanine
complexes, the distinctive
derivate-shaped Faraday A1 terms observed
in the magnetic CD (MCD) spectra (Figures 4–6) have been
used to definitively identify the band centers of the Q- and B-bands.76−81 The readily identified derivative-shaped
Faraday A1 term arises from the
Zeeman splitting of orbitally degenerate excited states and in the
absence of extensive band overlap has an inflection point that corresponds
to the band center of the main x/y-polarized absorption band in the Q-band region (Figures 4–6). The validity of Gouterman’s four-orbital model in the context
of phthalocyanines has been confirmed by moment analyses of the absorption
and MCD spectra of Mg(II) and Zn(II) complexes of the parent unsubstituted
phthalocyanine, since the spectral envelope in the Q-band region has A1/D0 ratios (which provides the excited-state magnetic moment since
the electric dipole moment contribution cancels out) of up to 3.55ℏ.81 This demonstrates that the Q-band still retains
a significant portion of its forbidden character.

Figure 4 Experimental MCD and
UV–vis spectra of H2[(tBu)4Pc] and Zn[(tBu)4Pc] in chloroform (TOP) are
plotted on an energy scale to provide a comparison with the positions
of the vertical transitions calculated in gas phase for the H2Pc and ZnPc model complexes optimized in gas phase at the BP86/def2-SVP+D3BJ
level of theory. The size of the vertical lines is proportional to
the oscillator strengths of the corresponding transitions. For clarity,
only transitions with Fosc. > 0.005
are
shown. Red is used to highlight the Q- and B-bands that are associated
with excitations predominantly involving the a, s, –a, and –s of Michl’s
perimeter model. Blue lines show transitions predominantly involving
non-Michl’s orbitals.

The B-transitions of phthalocyanines typically overlap and
mix
with other close-lying ππ* transitions resulting in a
broad absorption envelope that is observed in the 300–400 nm
region. A detailed assignment of these transitions has been discussed
in depth in the literature, often providing controversial interpretations.54,76−78,82 The large ΔHOMO
value of phthalocyanines is known to result in extensive configurational
interaction between the B excited state that arises primarily from
one-electron transitions between the s MO and the –a and –s MOs and other higher-energy
ππ* states that are associated with transitions from MOs
that are localized primarily on the peripheral fused benzene rings.
Analysis of the MCD spectra has also demonstrated that there are at
least two intense overlapping bands in the 300–400 nm region.76−81 This led to the Q (ca. 660 nm), B (ca. 320 nm), N (ca. 275 nm),
L (ca. 245 nm), and C (ca. 210 nm) band nomenclature sequence originally
recommended by Gouterman83 on the basis
of spectral measurements in the gas phase to be amended as Q, B1, B2, N, L, and C, respectively.76−81 More recently, Nemykin et al. have demonstrated that the relative
energies of the s MO and close-lying MOs that are localized
primarily on the fused benzene rings depend to a significant extent
on the size of the Hartree–Fock component incorporated into
the exchange-correlation functional, which is used for these calculations.54 This makes an accurate description of the B-band
region of the phthalocyanine spectrum highly challenging, since even
small changes in the energies of the s MO and other close-lying
ππ* can radically alter the predicted optical properties.

The Q-bands in the spectra of metal-free Pc ligands are split into x- and y-polarized components (Figures 4–6) due to the splitting of the –a and –s MOs that is related to the presence of
inner NH nitrogens aligned with the y axis that results
in the geometry changes reported in Figure 2. Upon metalation, the –a and –s orbitals become degenerate, and a single x/y-degenerate Q-band is observed.13 In contrast to the spectra of metal complexes, coupled pairs of
oppositely signed Gaussian-shaped Faraday B0 terms are observed in the context of the MCD spectra
of metal-free Pcs (Figures 4–6) due to the splitting of
the –a and –s MOs (Figure 3).80,81 In the context of the peripherally substituted Pcs, the Q-bands
are located at 660–700 nm in the case of the metal-free ligands.
Nonperipheral substitution results in a strong relative destabilization
of the a MO, since there are larger MO coefficients on
the α-carbons on these atoms than in the case with the s, –a, and –s MOs,
resulting in a stronger mesomeric interaction with the lone pairs
of the oxygen atoms. The resulting destabilization of the HOMO and
the narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap shift the Q-band bathochromically
to 750–800 nm. The Q-band splitting in the H2[(α-BuO)8Pc] spectrum decreases to 25 nm
from 36 nm in the spectrum of H2[(β-BuO)8Pc]. The 400–450 nm region of the alkoxy-substituted
Pc spectra corresponds to transitions from low-lying MOs localized
mostly on the peripheral benzene rings and the lone pairs of the oxygen
atoms. These transitions are typically described as CT bands, since
they involve the transfer of charge from the ligand periphery to MOs
localized on the inner ligand perimeter. The absence of a significant
circular redistribution of charge on the inner ligand perimeter means
that there is a relatively small magnetic dipole transition moment
involved and this results in relatively weak MCD band envelopes that
are dominated primarily by Faraday B0 terms that arise from the field-induced mixing of states (Figures 4–6).14,15

In the subsequent section,
the benchmarking of the TD-DFT methods
will be achieved through a comparison of the calculated and experimental
spectra mainly in the Q- and CT-band regions, due to the greater relevance
of this range of the spectrum for most practical applications.

2.3 Prediction of Vertical Excitations in the
UV–Vis Spectra of Phthalocyanines
The results of the
calculations performed using the four methods for MPc, M[(β-MeO)8Pc], and M[(α-MeO)8Pc] (M = 2H, Zn) with seven selected functionals and the commonly
used 6-31G(d) basis sets in the gas phase are summarized in Tables 1–4 and Figures 4–6. Previously it has been demonstrated that addition
of polarizations and/or diffuse functions to 6-31G(d) basis sets has
only a minor effect on the TD-DFT excitation energies of tetrapyrrolic
compounds, and are hence not worth the extra computational cost.54,59,84

2.3.1 Prediction
of Vertical Excitations in the
Q-Band Region of UV–Vis Spectra of Unsubstituted Phthalocyanines H2Pc and ZnPc
The use of
the TDA approximation is characterized by a large overestimation of
the energies of the Q-bands in comparison to the experimental values,
which can be readily identified by using the crossover point in the
Faraday A1 term in the MCD spectrum
of Zn[(tBu)4Pc] and the coupled pair of oppositely signed Faraday B0 terms in the MCD spectrum of H2[(tBu)4Pc] (Figure 4). The errors lie within the 0.2–0.4
eV range depending on which exchange-correlation functional is applied.
This result suggests that TDA is particularly inaccurate in the prediction
of the UV–visible absorption spectra of phthalocyanines.

In the case of full TD-DFT, the errors in the predicted Q-band energies
are smaller, but they are more sensitive to functional selection,
with minimum values obtained in this regard for LC-BLYP and ωB97X
(0.03–0.04 eV). Calculations with these functionals are also
characterized by the best accuracy for the prediction of the Q-band
splitting. Values of 36.8 and 34.4 nm are predicted in the case of
the metal-free H2Pc ligand as opposed to 36 nm for H2[(tBu)4Pc] in chloroform. The energy of the Q-band
in ZnPc is also accurately predicted. The error associated
with the use of the CAM-B3LYP range-separated hybrid functional (0.2
eV) for the prediction of the Q-band is comparable to the one given
by GGA, hybrid GGA, and meta-GGA functionals; the latter three families
of functionals are also particularly inaccurate when the Q-band splitting
is taken into consideration.

In the case of the simplified methods,
the sTDA calculation provides
a smaller discrepancy between the experimental and calculated energies
of the Q-bands than the TDA method. This improvement in accuracy is
particularly notable in the case of the M06 and CAM-B3LYP functionals.

Finally, sTD-DFT provides the best fit between the calculated and
experimental energies of the Q-bands, especially in the case of the
three range-separated hybrid functionals and the meta-GGA M06 functional.
However, only the CAM-B3LYP functional provides an almost correct
value for the Q-band splitting in the case of the metal-free ligand H2Pc (33.1 nm), while
underestimating the energy of the Q-bands by only 0.02–0.03
eV. The other two range-separated hybrids provide less accurate positions
for the Q-bands with errors below 0.1 eV, while Q-band splittings
of 24.5 and 26 nm are predicted in the calculations with the LC-BLYP
and ωB97X functionals, respectively.

2.3.2 Prediction
of Vertical Excitations in the
Q- and CT-Regions of UV–Vis Spectra of Octa-MeO-phthalocyanines M[(α-MeO)8Pc] and M[(β-MeO)8Pc], M = 2H, Zn
The trends in the Q-bands
predicted for the M[(β-MeO)8Pc] model complexes by all four approaches (Figure 5) are similar to
those observed for the corresponding unsubstituted MPc compounds (Figure 4). In the case of every functional considered, TDA provides less
accurate predictions when a comparison is made with the experimental
spectra.

Figure 5 Experimental MCD and UV–vis spectra of H2[(β-BuO)8Pc] and Zn[(β-BuO)8Pc] in chloroform (TOP) are plotted on
an energy scale to provide a comparison with the positions of the
vertical transitions calculated in gas phase for the H2[(β-MeO)8Pc]Pc and Zn[(β-MeO)8Pc] model complexes optimized in gas phase
at the BP86/def2-SVP+D3BJ level of theory. The size of the vertical
lines is proportional to the oscillator strengths of the corresponding
transitions. For clarity, only transitions with Fosc. > 0.005 are shown. Red is used to highlight the
Q-
and B-bands that are associated with excitations predominantly involving
the a, s, –a, and –s of Michl’s perimeter model. Blue lines show
transitions predominantly involving non-Michl’s orbitals.

TD-DFT and particularly sTD-DFT
provide notably more accurate results
for the Q- and CT-bands in conjunction with the CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP,
and ωB97X range-separated hybrid functionals. Again, the spectra
predicted within the full TD-DFT approach using the LC-BLYP and ωB97X
functionals are in close agreement with the experimental ones, and
CAM-B3LYP overestimates the Q-band energies by ca. 0.3 eV. In contrast,
the application of CAM-B3LYP provides the best accuracy when the simplified
TD-DFT approach is adopted. The errors in the Q-band predictions lie
within 0.01–0.02 eV, and the splitting patterns of the Q-bands
of H2[(β-MeO)8Pc] and Zn[(β-MeO)8Pc] are also correctly predicted.

It is noteworthy that the introduction of peripheral MeO substituents
has a crucial effect on the accuracy of the predictions of the other
spectral features in the cases of pure, hybrid, and meta-GGAs when
all four approaches are adopted.

In the case of BP86, weak bands
with very low Fosc. values can be observed
in the calculated spectra
of both H2[(β-MeO)8Pc] and Zn[(β-MeO)8Pc], whose energies are smaller
than those of the Q-bands. This clearly contradicts the experimental
data. These bands are assigned to transitions with significant CT
character involving MOs that lie close in energy to the a and s frontier π-MOs. Only weak bands are observed
in the MCD spectra (Figure 5), since the CT transitions involved lack the large orbital
angular momentum changes associated with the redistributions of charge
on the inner ligand perimeter that are generated by the Q- and B-transitions.
In the case of the hybrid (B3LYP and TPSSh) and meta-GGAs (M06) functionals,
these bands are predicted to have considerably higher energies, but
they are still underestimated by 0.5 eV in comparison to the experimental
data. It must be concluded, therefore, that the overall accuracy of
calculations with these functionals in this context is inappropriately
low. Similar effects were observed previously in the case of phthalocyanines
bearing electron-rich 15-crown-5-oxanthrene substituents,85,86 whose treatment with TDA and TD-DFT methods at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory led to misguided conclusions about the nature of CT-bands
in their spectra.

The level of accuracy observed in the calculations
obtained for
the α-MeO-substituted phthalocyanines (Figure 6) is similar to that observed in the results obtained for
β-MeO-substituted macrocycles (Figure 5). Again, the best overall accuracy is observed
when the sTD-DFT method was used with the CAM-B3LYP range-separated
hybrid functional. The bathochromic shift of the Q-band upon α-alkoxy-substitution
is well reproduced, as is the decrease in the Q-band splitting in
the case of the metal-free ligand. Within all four DFT approaches,
all but the range-separated hybrid functionals predict low-lying CT
transitions with energies strongly underestimated in comparison to
the observed experimental data.

Figure 6 Experimental MCD and UV–vis spectra
of H2[(α-BuO)8Pc] and Zn[(α-BuO)8Pc] in chloroform (TOP) are
plotted on
an energy scale to provide a comparison with the positions of the
vertical transitions calculated in gas phase for the H2[(α-MeO)8Pc]Pc and Zn[(α-MeO)8Pc] model complexes optimized in gas phase
at the BP86/def2-SVP+D3BJ level of theory. The size of the vertical
lines is proportional to the oscillator strengths of the corresponding
transitions. For clarity, only transitions with Fosc. > 0.005 are shown. Red is used to highlight the
Q-
and B-bands that are associated with excitations predominantly involving
the a, s, –a, and –s of Michl’s perimeter model. Blue lines show
transitions predominantly involving non-Michl’s orbitals.

Notably, the deformation of the
α-substituted macrocycles
to form a lower-symmetry compound results in the appearance of numerous
additional transitions, which are symmetry forbidden in spectra of
the corresponding unsubstituted and β-MeO-substituted analogues,
which possess highly symmetrical planar structures. There is a marked
intensification of the CT band region of the MCD spectra relative
to the B-band for this reason (Figure 6).

2.3.3 Effects of Starting Geometry,
Solvation,
Basis Sets, and Energy Threshold on sTD-DFT Excitation Energies
The spectacular speedup of calculations that is facilitated by
the sTD-DFT method allows for fast screening of various effects (e.g.,
molecular geometry, solvation effects within SMD in CHCl3, and basis sets) that influence the excitation energies in the UV–vis
spectra of phthalocyanines, so a comparison in the trends predicted
can readily be made with those for full TD-DFT calculations, which
have been comprehensively studied and reported previously.54,64Table 5 summarizes
the various combinations of different computational conditions applied
for this screening when using the BP86 functional for geometry optimizations
and the CAM-B3LYP functional for sTD-DFT calculations. Comparisons
of experimental and simulated spectra are provided in Figures 7–9, which reveal that there are only minor effects
on the excitation energies when the starting geometry, solvation,
and basis sets selection are taken into consideration.

To reveal the
influence of starting geometry, we compared the results
obtained for def2-SVP- and def2-TZVP-optimized gas-phase geometries
(entries A and B). The alteration of geometrical characteristics of
molecules upon going from double- to triple-ζ basis sets was
only minor (Figure 2). It was followed by an increase in the excitation energies by 0.01
eV, which correlates with the previously made conclusion about the
insignificant influence of starting geometry on the full TD-DFT outcome.

The influence of solvent on excitation energies was studied in
CHCl3 by using the SMD continuum solvation model.68 With this goal in mind, gas-phase def2-SVP and
def2-TZVP geometries were used to perform sTD-DFT/SMD calculations
(nonequilibrium approach, entries C and D). The predicted energies
were compared to those obtained from SMD def2-SVP and def2-TZVP geometries
(equilibrium approach, entries E and F). It was found that both of
these approaches provide the same values for the Q-band excitation
energies, suggesting that the consideration of solvation in sTD-DFT
calculations is more important than its application during geometry
optimizations.

Finally, the influence of basis sets selection
on sTD-DFT calculations
was studied by using four Pople basis sets—6-31G(d) and 6-311G(d,p)
(entries A and H) as an example. Moving from valence-split double-
to triple-ζ basis sets has only minor effects on the predicted
excitation energies. The use of 6-31+G(d) with diffuse functions proved
to be problematic in terms of the convergence of the sTD-DFT calculations,
so this approach could not be tested further; however, it has previously
been demonstrated that the addition of diffuse functions is not worth
the extra computational cost.23,59,87 The addition of polarization functions on hydrogen atoms in basis
sets 6-31G(d,p) and 6-311G(d,p) was found to have a minuscule influence
below 0.01 eV on the sTD-DFT outcome.

Importantly, the same
trends are observed for other transitions,
including the B-band excitations. Altogether, these results are in
agreement with the conclusions that were previously drawn for full
TD-DFT calculations of phthalocyanines concerning the influence of
starting geometry, solvation effects, and basis sets selection on
the calculated spectra.54,59,84

The effect of the extent of the polarization functions included
into the double-ζ basis set was studied by using the BP86/def2-SVP
gas-phase geometries with the CAM-B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d,p),
6-31G(2d), 6-31G(2d,p), 6-31G(2d,2p), 6-31G(2df), 6-31G(2df,2p), and
6-31G(2df,2pd) basis sets (Figure 10). It was found that on moving from 6-31G(d) to 6-31G(2d)
basis sets, there is a 0.08–0.10 eV decrease of the Q-band
excitation energies, while moving to 6-31G(2df) has a much weaker
effect on the excitation energies of less than 0.02 eV. The addition
of any amount of polarization functions to the hydrogen atoms was
found to have a negligibly small effect on the Q-band excitation energies
of less than 0.002 eV.

of the model complexes
calculated using the sTD-DFT method by using the CAM-B3LYP functional
with various double-ζ basis sets. The geometries of the complexes
were optimized in the gas phase at the BP86/def2-SVP level of theory.

The trends observed in the predicted
energies for the other higher-energy
bands when different double-ζ basis sets [6-31G(d), 6-31G(2d),
or 6-31G(2df)] are used are summarized in Figures 11–13. It can be clearly observed that the effects associated with
the addition of more polarization functions into the basis sets are
relatively minor. Again, it should be emphasized that although changing
the basis sets does influence the predicted energies of the vertical
excitations, it does not significantly affect the trends predicted
in the spectral properties across the series of structurally related
substituted free bases and metallophthalocyanines that were used in
this study.

level of theory. The bandwidths in the simulated spectra were set

The use of the sTDA
and sTD-DFT approaches affords a spectacular
speedup in the calculations in terms of the duration of the CIS module.
In the present study, the “classical” TDA and TD-DFT
calculations performed on eight parallel processes for the model complexes
took 0.2–1 h to predict the 16 roots. Figure 14 provides the duration of the calculations
for the Zn[(β-MeO)8Pc] model complex. The simplified sTDA and sTD-DFT approaches
took less than 10 s to provide a notably larger number of roots, which
is defined by the energy threshold (Ethresh = 5 eV) up to which configuration state functions (CSFs) are included.

Figure 14 Durations
observed for the CIS module of the gas-phase TD-DFT,
TDA, sTD-DFT, and sTDA calculations performed for the Zn[(β-MeO)8Pc] model complex optimized
in the gas phase at the BP86/def2-SVP level of theory. The number
of roots for TDA and TD-DFT was set to 16, while the numbers marked
in blue correspond to numbers used for the sTDA and sTD-DFT calculations,
which depended on the number of orbitals taken into consideration
for the calculations.

The introduction of a smaller Ethresh means that all excited configurations, which lie higher in energy,
are neglected. This drastically reduces the amount of calculations
required and results in the observed orders of magnitude speedup of
sTD-DFT calculations.40 The drawback of
this feature is the dependence of the absolute value of excitation
energy on the Ethresh value because some
correlation with other states can be neglected. We checked the trend
in predicted Q-band energies for H2[(β-MeO)8Pc] and Zn[(β-MeO)8Pc] at a series of different Ethresh values (Figure 15). The Ethresh value has a notable effect
on excitation energies, which systematically increase by 0.1 eV upon
the increase of Ethresh from 4 to 6 eV.
Nevertheless, the dependence trends for both compounds are nearly
parallel, suggesting that correlations between known compounds and
their sTD-DFT spectra can be used to determine an appropriate spectral
shift for the prediction of spectra of unknown compounds.

state functions (CSFs) are included.

2.3.4 Prediction of Vertical Excitations in the
B-Region of the UV–Visible Spectra of Phthalocyanines
The errors associated with the prediction of s → –s and s → –a transitions (i.e., the B-bands) strongly depend on the molecule,
and the methodology and functional selected. Moreover, these errors
cannot be correlated with the accuracy of the prediction of the Q-bands.
For example, using the sTD-DFT method at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level,
the predictions for the Q-bands of both H2Pc and ZnPc are particularly accurate.
B-bands are predicted at 3.35 and 3.74 eV in the spectrum of H2Pc, which satisfactorily
matches the position of the B-band in the experimental spectrum (broad
absorption band with a maximum at 3.63 eV corresponding to an intense
Faraday A1 term or a coupled
pair of Faraday B0 terms in the
MCD spectrum). However, when the same method is applied to ZnPc, the B-band is predicted to lie at 3.97 eV, while in contrast, the
experimental value is 3.58 eV. Moving from computationally modest
gas-phase calculations with double-ζ basis sets to augmented
computational conditions that included more polarization functions
did not improve the accuracy of B-band prediction (Figures 7–9 and Figures 1–3).

Again, it should be emphasized that the
Q-band region, which is the most important from the standpoint of
applications, can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. However,
neither full TD-DFT nor its simplified versions can provide a general
description of the B-band region of phthalocyanine spectra, which
can successfully be applied to any molecule due to the complex mixing
of states that occurs in this energy region. It should be emphasized
that this result cannot be improved significantly through the application
of extended basis sets for initial geometry optimization or by introducing
a solvation model. Therefore, further advances in theoretical calculations
are still required to achieve the ultimate goal of “the possibility
of employing a TD-DFT approach for the accurate prediction of vertical
excitation energies in phthalocyanines within a large energy range”.54,64

3 Conclusions
The
use of the calculated UV–visible absorption spectra
of phthalocyanines to interpret experimental data and rationally design
new chromophores for applications is a challenging task given the
size of the molecules and the general need for fast and accurate computational
approaches.

In the present study, a methodological survey to
determine the
relative merits of the full TD-DFT method and its Tamm–Dancoff
modification (TDA), as well as the relatively new simplified sTD-DFT
and sTDA implementations for the prediction of the UV–visible–NIR
spectra of phthalocyanines is reported. To the best of our knowledge,
the latter two methodologies have not previously been systematically
tested on porphyrinoids.

Seven of the most popular exchange-correlation
functionals were
tested with four different approaches related to TD-DFT by running
calculations for a set of model geometries. The best accuracy for
the Q-band region was observed for both the unsubstituted and alkoxy-substituted
phthalocyanine spectra when using the LC-BLYP and ωB97X range-separated
hybrid functionals in the case of full TD-DFT and when using the CAM-B3LYP
in a similar manner in the case of sTD-DFT. The description of the
B-band region is much less accurate, and this problem still needs
further theoretical work to make further advances in how calculations
are carried out.

The overall results obtained for the selected
series of model complexes
emphasize the need to check the broad range of molecules to provide
a benchmark for the reliability of DFT methods when dealing with phthalocyanines.
Previously, such studies were typically performed on ZnPc(60,88−90) and this resulted in the successful
prediction of its spectrum by the methods that are generally inapplicable
for the substituted derivatives. This conclusion can also be drawn
where the TD-DFT and sTDA calculations with the BP86 and M06 functionals
are concerned since although they are characterized by relatively
small errors for the prediction of the Q-bands (Table 1), these functionals are particularly inaccurate
where the other bands in the spectra of substituted phthalocyanines
are concerned.

As long as sTD-DFT predicts trends that match
those observed experimentally
across a series of compounds, the MO approach can still be used to
rationalize the observed spectral and redox changes in terms of the
energies of the frontier MOs. At that point, the faster calculation
times should help to facilitate studies that would previously have
been too expensive in processing time terms. Therefore, it is anticipated
that this approach will be widely used in the years ahead so that
desktop computers can be routinely used during the interpretation
of UV–visible–NIR spectra of phthalocyanines and related
macrocycles. Studies of this type will probably extend in future to
the multidecker sandwich complexes of phthalocyanines and related
macrocycles that are formed through covalent and coordination bonding
and also to supramolecular assemblies.

4 Experimental
Section
Phthalocyanines were synthesized using previously
reported procedures.91−93 UV–vis and matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectra of the synthesized compounds were in agreement
with the proposed structures. UV–vis spectra were measured
with a Thermo Evolution 210 spectrometer in quartz cells with a 1
cm optical path. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were measured on a Bruker
Daltonics Ultraflex spectrometer with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as
the matrix. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra were recorded
on a Chirascan plus spectrodichrometer equipped with a permanent magnet,
which produces magnetic fields of 1.0 T with both parallel and antiparallel
fields.

The ORCA 4.0.1 package45,46 was used to
carry out
the geometry optimizations, and the four sets of spectral calculations
were run by using the Windows 10 Pro operation system on a desktop
computer fitted with a 3.7 GHz Intel Core i7-4820 K processor and
64 GB of random-access memory. All calculations were performed in
eight parallel processes using the native Microsoft MPI. The Gabedit
2.3.0 program was used to prepare the input files and to follow the
progress of the calculations,94 and the
Chemissian 4.58 program (by L. Skripnikov) was used to analyze and
visualize the results of the quantum-chemical calculations. For the
current version, see www.chemissian.com.

The geometry optimizations for the series of model compounds
were
performed by using the BP86 functional with def2-SVP or def2-TZVP
basis sets95 in gas phase or in chloroform
within the SMD solvation model.68 Tight
self-consistent field convergence criteria were set without symmetry
constraints. The RIJCOSX approximation96,97 was used with
auxiliary basis def2/J98 to accelerate
the calculations without notable loss of accuracy. The geometry optimization
was performed using Grimme’s atom-pairwise dispersion correction
and Becke–Johnson damping (D3BJ),99 which is particularly important to reproduce the steric crowding
of the eight neighboring MeO groups in nonperipherally substituted
phthalocyanines.

The TDA, TD-DFT, sTDA, and sTD-DFT calculations
were performed
with 6-31G(d) basis set on the DFT-optimized structures by using a
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional (BP86), two GGA
hybrid functionals (B3LYP and TPSSh functionals), a meta-GGA functional
(M06), and three range-separated hybrid functionals (CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP,
and ωB97X).100,101 The TDA and TD-DFT approaches
were used to predict 16 vertical excitations since this is typically
sufficient for the interpretation of the Q-band, and CT- and B-regions
of phthalocyanine spectra. The sTDA and sTD-DFT approaches were used
to predict the vertical transitions with energies below 5 eV with
the RIJCOSX approximation applied to accelerate the calculations.
In each case, the output files are provided as Supporting Information, along with detailed information about
energies, oscillator strengths (Fosc.),
wave functions of corresponding excitations, and absorption spectra
via transition electric dipole moments (with components of the electronic
transition dipole moment Tx, Ty, and Tz provided in
atomic units along with the square of the transition moment T2). The sTDA and sTD-DFT output files contain
the length and velocity expressions for the oscillator and rotatory
strengths—fL, fV, RL, and RV, respectively. The influence of
various factors on the sTD-DFT calculations was analyzed by using
the CAM-B3LYP functional with a range of different double-ζ
basis sets 6-31G(d,p), 6-31G(2d), 6-31G(2d,p), 6-31G(2d,2p), 6-31G(2df),
6-31G(2df,2p), and 6-31G(2df,2pd), as well as triple-ζ 6-311G(d)
basis sets either in the gas phase or in chloroform (SMD model) with
both BP86/def2-SVP and BP86/def2-TZVP optimized geometries.
