We
computationally investigate the mechanism of the reduction half-cycle
of the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia.
We compare both Fe- and Cu-exchanged zeolite catalysts and aim at
exploring all accessible reaction pathways. From our calculations,
a comprehensive picture emerges that unifies several previous mechanistic
proposals. We find that both for Fe and for Cu catalysts different
reaction pathways are feasible but some of the possible reaction pathways
differ in these two cases. Our computational results provide a basis
for the interpretation of in situ spectroscopic investigations that
can possibly distinguish the different mechanistic pathways.

1 Introduction
The
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is widely used for the
removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust-gas
aftertreatment systems of vehicles with diesel engines.1−4 In the presence of suitable heterogeneous catalysts, NOx can be reduced by reaction with ammonia injected
into the exhaust-gas flow. Transition-metal zeolite catalysts are
available for SCR and are predominately used in automotive applications.2,4−6 The most widely used zeolite catalysts are the iron-based
Fe-ZSM-57−9 and copper-exchanged zeolites with the chabazite
structure, particularly Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-SAPO-34.10,11 The latter are particularly attractive due to their hydrothermal
stability. More recently, the chabazite iron-catalyst Fe-SSZ-13 has
also been demonstrated to show high-temperature SCR activity.12

Both the structure of the catalytically
active metal centers in
these catalysts and the catalytic mechanism of the SCR reaction have
been studied extensively both experimentally and computationally.
For the chabazite-based catalysts, the nature of the catalytically
active sites has been investigated, both for Cu-SSZ-1313−16 and Cu-SAPO-3417 as well as for Fe-SSZ-13.18,19 Different studies agree that the major active species are single
CuII or FeIII centers located in the 6-membered
or 8-membered rings of the zeolite framework, where they balance the
negative charge of an Al3+ site. Depending on the coordination
of further ligands such as water, NH3, or NO as well as
on temperature, the Cu centers can detach from the zeolite framework
and can become mobile.15,20−24 On the other hand, Fe centers are believed to be
more strongly bound and remain immobile within the zeolite framework.19

Even though many details of the catalytic
mechanism have been elucidated,
the SCR mechanism is still not fully understood.25−28 This is particularly true for
Fe-exchanged zeolite catalysts, which have been studied less extensively
than Cu-exchanged zeolite catalysts. Although for Cu catalysts computational
studies explored different possible mechanistic pathways,17,22,29−32 a comprehensive computational
picture of the SCR mechanism for Fe catalysts is still lacking.26,33 Here, we aim at closing this gap by computationally exploring different
possible mechanistic pathways for the reduction half-cycle of the
SCR reaction with Fe catalysts. In addition, we set out to compare
these reaction pathways for Fe and Cu zeolite catalysts to provide
a unified picture.

There is general agreement that the SCR reaction
proceeds via the
redox cycle schematically shown in Figure 1a (ref (28)). First, in the reduction half-cycle, NO and
NH3 react to N2 and H2O while reducing
the catalytic metal center. Second, in the oxidation half-cycle, the
catalytic metal center is reoxidized. This slow reoxidation is generally
considered to be the rate-determining step. The reaction equation
of the oxidation half-cycle will differ depending on the availability
of NO2 (see Figure 1a). Different detailed mechanistic proposals have been made
for the oxidation half-cycle with Cu-exchanged zeolite catalysts under
both standard SCR and fast SCR conditions.17,22,29−31,34 Most likely, the oxidation half-cycle proceeds via the formation
of dimeric Cu species.22,35

and the fast SCR reaction.

metal center, whereas Mx–1 (red)

simplified reaction mechanisms for the SCR reduction half-cycle on
the NH3-first pathway (left) and the NO-first
pathway (right).

Here, we focus on the
reduction half-cycle of the SCR reaction.
Most generally, this first part of the SCR reaction can proceed via
two different mechanistic pathways (see Figure 1b) by adsorbing either NH3 or
NO at the catalytic metal center in the first step. If NH3 is coordinated first (NH3-first pathway), a proton needs
to be transferred either to another ligand or to the zeolite framework.
NO can subsequently either be adsorbed at the metal center or directly
attack the coordinated NH2 ligand. Both possibilities lead
to the release of N2 and H2O via an NH2NO intermediate. If NO reacts first (NO-first pathway), one generally
assumes the intermediate formation of a HONO ligand, either via an
intermediate NO complex or via a direct attack of NO at an OH– ligand. Subsequently, this HONO ligand reacts with
NH3 to form N2 and 2H2O. Again, this
step could proceed either via intermediates in which NH3 is coordinated with the metal center or via a direct attack of NH3 at the HONO ligand.

Previous computational studies
for Cu-exchanged zeolite catalysts
provide an ambiguous picture for the reduction half-cycle. Although
refs (17, 22, 30) assume the SCR reduction half-cycle to proceed via the NH3-first pathway, refs (29, 31) consider the NO-first pathway. In ref (34), both pathways are explored, with the computational
results suggesting that the reaction via a HONO intermediate is preferred.
Further details of these different mechanistic proposals will be discussed
below. Based on kinetic and spectroscopic studies of SCR catalyzed
by Fe-ZSM-5, mechanisms proceeding via different variants of an NO-first
pathway have been suggested,36,37 whereas computational
investigations assumed mechanisms via the NH3-first pathway.33,38

2 Results and Discussion
To computationally
explore the mechanism of the SCR reaction with
Fe and Cu zeolite catalysts, we employ minimal models of the active
center33,39 as shown in Figure 2b,c. These models are based on the optimized
structure of the model shown in Figure 2a. In both cases, we consider overall neutral models
of the active center (see the Supporting Information for further discussions). The use of a minimal active-site model
will allow us to identify feasible reaction pathways and to reveal
intrinsic mechanistic differences between Fe and Cu catalysts that
are independent of the precise nature of the active center. A comparison
to a larger active-site model as well as to an NH3-solvated
active-site model  is provided in the Supporting Information.

calculations. (b) Optimized molecular structure of our starting model

O (red), N (blue), Al (gray), Si (light brown), and H (white). The
coordinates of the atoms highlighted in cyan for models (b) and (c)
are kept fixed at their positions in model (a) in all our calculations.

We start by considering possible
reaction pathways for the reduction
half-cycle of the SCR reaction with Fe-exchanged zeolite catalysts
(see Figure 3) and
start from the overall neutral model [Z–FeIII(OH)2] (A, see Figure 2b) with a d5 high-spin electron configuration.
Such species have been identified as the major monomeric Fe species
in Fe-SSZ-13 catalysts.18

Figure 3 (a) Reaction pathways
considered for the mechanism of the reduction
half-cycle of the SCR reaction catalyzed by Fe-exchanged zeolite catalysts.
Both pathways starting with the adsorption of NO (left) and with the
adsorption of NH3 (right) are considered. (b) Calculated
energy profiles (BP86/TZ2P) for the considered reaction pathways.
For all FeIII species (blue), the high-spin (S = 5/2) state is the ground state. For the FeII species,
the calculated energies of both the high-spin (S =
2, red) and low-spin (S = 0, green) states are included.

The first possible SCR reaction
pathway (NH3-first pathway,
see the right part of Figure 3a) starts with the adsorption of NH3, leading to
[Z–FeIII(OH)2(NH3)] (B). This step is exothermic by −56 kJ/mol. Subsequently,
a proton is shifted from the NH3 ligand to one of the OH– ligands, resulting in [Z–FeIII(OH)(H2O)(NH3)] (C), which can abstract a
water molecule to arrive at [Z–FeIII(OH)(NH2)] (D). This proton shift and the water abstraction
are endothermic and altogether require 82 kJ/mol. However, we could
not identify any feasible alternatives on the NH3-first
pathway.

Intermediate D can now react with NO in
two different
ways. First, NO can be coordinated to form [Z–FeII(OH)(NH2)(NO)] (E), reducing FeIII to low-spin (S = 0) FeII. A rearrangement,
in which the NH2 ligand shifts to form a N–N bond,
then leads to [Z–FeII(OH)(NONH2)] (G). According to our computations, G has a high-spin
(S = 2) ground state, i.e., this step requires a
spin crossover. Species G can release N2 and
H2O via (I), finally resulting in a reduced
iron species [Z–FeII(OH)] (J). Alternatively,
one could assume a direct reaction of NO from the gas phase with the
NH2 ligand. The only plausible resulting intermediate that
we could find in our calculations is species F, which
contains an ON–NH2 ligand coordinated with the Fe
center via the nitrogen atoms. Again, our computations show a high-spin
(S = 2) ground state for this species, which could
further react to J under release of N2 and
H2O. However, the formation of the alternative intermediate E from D is exothermic by −119 kJ/mol,
whereas F is 60 kJ/mol higher in energy than E. Therefore, this reaction path would most likely proceed via E with a coordination of NO with the iron center instead of
a direct reaction of NO from the gas phase.

The second possible
SCR reaction pathway (NO-first pathway, see
the left part of Figure 3a) starts with the adsorption of NO, leading to [Z–FeII(OH)2(NO)] (K) while reducing the
Fe center to low-spin (S = 0) FeII. This
step is exothermic by −95 kJ/mol. The subsequent formation
of an intermediate [Z–FeII(OH)2(NO)(NH3)], in which NO and NH3 are simultaneously coordinated
with the Fe center, was not stable in our computations. Instead, K rearranges under formation of a HONO ligand, which could
be coordinated either via an oxygen atom (L) or via the
nitrogen atom (M), which are almost equal in energy.
Both L and M have a high-spin (S = 2) ground state in our calculations, and the formation of the
HONO ligand thus requires a spin crossover.

After the formation
of L or M, NH3 can coordinate,
resulting in [Z–FeII(HONO)(NH3)], with
HONO coordinated via the oxygen atom (N) or via the nitrogen
atom (O), respectively. This step
is exothermic by 57 and 68 kJ/mol, respectively, and the two intermediates N and O differ in energy by only 14 kJ/mol. Abstraction
of H2O from O leads to [Z–FeII(OH)(NH2)(NO)] (E), which can release N2 and H2O via G and I or
via F and I (see above).

Overall,
according to our calculations, a mechanism via the NO-first
pathway seems more likely as it does not require the energetically
unfavorable intermediate D that needs to be formed on
the NH3-first pathway. The highest-energy intermediates
on the NO-first pathway are L and M, which
are 41–44 kJ/mol lower in energy than D. Both
the mechanisms via L and M, i.e., via the
formation of a HONO ligand and subsequent adsorption of NH3, are possible according to our computational results. According
to our calculations, all accessible reaction pathways require a spin
crossover from low-spin to high-spin FeII. However, because
of the known insufficiencies of density-functional approximations
for spin-state energy differences,40−42 it cannot be ruled out
that for some of our high-spin FeII intermediates the corresponding
low-spin species are actually more stable (see the Supporting Information for additional calculations and discussion).

For comparison, we considered the same possible reaction pathways
for the SCR reaction catalyzed by Cu-exchanged zeolites (see Figure 4). Here, we start
from the overall neutral model [Z–CuII(OH)] (A, see Figure 2c), which is in line with the neutral models considered in refs (22, 29, 34). Similar
results are obtained for a negatively charged model [Z–CuII(OH)2]− resembling the models
used in refs (17, 30, 31) (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 (a) Reaction pathways considered for the mechanism of the reduction
half-cycle of the SCR reaction catalyzed by Cu-exchanged zeolite catalysts.
Both pathways starting with the adsorption of NO (left) and with the
adsorption of NH3 (right) are considered. (b) Calculated
energy profiles (BP86/TZ2P) for the considered reaction pathways.

For the NH3-first pathway
(see the right part of Figure 4), the same possible
reaction steps and intermediates as for the case of Fe-exchanged zeolite
catalysts were found, even though the relative energies of the different
intermediates differ. Most importantly, the transfer of a proton from
the NH3 ligand to the OH ligand and the subsequent abstraction
of water (B to D) now require only 56 kJ/mol,
with D lying lower in energy by 20 kJ/mol than the starting
point A. Note that some previous calculations assume
a proton transfer to the zeolite framework in this step,17,22,30 which cannot be described by
our small model. However, according to ref (17), such a proton transfer would require 114 kJ/mol.
The further reactions via the formation and decomposition of an ON–NH2 ligand (F or G) can proceed via
steps that are all exothermic or require only little energy.

For the NO-first pathway (see the left part of Figure 4), there are some fundamental
differences to the case of Fe-exchanged zeolite catalysts. After coordination
of NO (K), the formation of a HONO ligand coordinated
via its oxygen atom L leads to the dissociation of the
HONO ligand after coordination of NH3 (N).
Thus, this path does not lead to the reduction of NO. Instead, the
formation of a HONO ligand coordinated via its nitrogen (M) atom is preferred and leads to O after coordination
of NH3. Alternatively, ammonia can coordinate with K under formation of P. Such an intermediate
was not available in the case of an Fe zeolite catalyst. Here, the
formation of P is energetically preferred compared to
that of M by 28 kJ/mol, but both can further react to
the same intermediate O. The remaining steps proceed
via the formation of E, which is endothermic by +70 kJ/mol,
and match those discussed above for the Fe zeolite catalyst.

Overall, also for Cu-based zeolite catalysts, the NO-first pathway
seems to be preferred, even though on the NH3-first pathway
the high-energy intermediate D is more favorable in the
case of a Cu catalyst than for an Fe catalyst. However, for a Cu catalyst,
the NO-first pathway cannot proceed via an intermediate L as it does for Fe catalysts. Instead, the SCR reaction will most
likely proceed via intermediate P, which is not accessible
with an Fe catalyst. The only slightly disfavored route via M is available for both Cu and Fe catalysts.

Our computational
elucidation of the possible catalytic reaction
pathways provides the basis for spectroscopic identification of catalytic
intermediates. A unique method for this purpose is provided by X-ray
spectroscopy.43,44 Based on in operando valence-to-core
X-ray emission spectroscopy (VtC-XES), we previously observed a peak
at ca. 7087 eV (“peak A”) for Fe-ZSM-5 that appears
at lower energies than the peak due to the lone pair at ligands coordinated
via oxygen (ca. 7091 eV, “peak B”) and the peak due
to the lone pair at ligands coordinated via nitrogen (ca. 7096 eV,
“peak C”). This led us to the conclusion that with Fe-ZSM-5
the SCR reaction proceeds via the NO-first pathway45 with an intermediate featuring HONO coordinated via its
central oxygen atom that bears a positive partial charge. On the other
hand, for Cu-SSZ-13, such a peak is absent from the in operando XES
spectra and thus a different mechanism via the NH3-first
pathway seems to be employed.32

To
reconcile these earlier spectroscopic results with our present
computational study, we calculated the XES spectra of all considered
intermediates. The calculated spectra of selected intermediates are
shown in Figure 5 (see
the Supporting Information for all calculated
spectra). These results confirm the previous assignment of peaks B
and C. For Fe catalysts, a spectroscopic feature that is clearly shifted
to lower energies by ca. 3 eV with respect to peak B is found only
for the low-spin states of L, N, and M. Thus, the peak A that was experimentally observed in ref (45) could indeed indicate
that the SCR reaction proceeds via the NO-first pathway for Fe catalysts.
However, this assignment holds only if the reaction proceeds via low-spin
FeII intermediates that are not the ground state in our
calculations. On the other hand, we can clearly rule out that peak
A is due to the coordination of NO with the iron center, as was suggested
in ref (28).

Figure 5 Calculated
(BP86/QZ4P) Fe K-edge and Cu K-edge XES spectra of selected
intermediates on the considered catalytic reaction pathways of the
SCR reaction with Fe catalysts (left) and with Cu catalysts (right).
The indicated assignment refers to the in operando measurements of
refs (45) and (32). Calculated XES spectra
of all considered intermediates are shown in the Supporting Information.

Of the intermediates considered for Cu catalysts, only the
intermediates L and N show a peak clearly
shifted to lower
energies compared to peak B in the calculated spectra. However, these
species do not lie on a feasible reaction path that leads to the reduction
of NO. Thus, the absence of such a peak in the in operando XES spectra
reported in ref (32) does not allow us to distinguish between the NH3-first and NO-first (via M or P) reaction
pathways.

3 Conclusions
We could computationally
identify several possible catalytic reaction
pathways for the reduction half-cycle of the selective catalytic reduction
of NOx with Fe- and Cu-exchanged zeolite
catalysts. They provide a comprehensive picture that unifies several
previous mechanistic proposals. We find that both for Fe and for Cu
catalysts different reaction pathways are available and both an NH3-first pathway and an NO-first pathway seem feasible, of which
the NO-first pathway is preferred according to our computational results.
Although on both pathways a coordination of NO at the metal center
and its direct reaction of NO with ligands coordinated at the metal
center are both possible, NH3 can react further only after
its adsorption at the metal center. However, some of the available
reaction pathways differ for Fe and Cu catalysts. Although for Fe
catalysts the SCR reaction can proceed via an intermediate with a
HONO ligand coordinated with the metal center via its central oxygen
atoms, this pathway is not possible for Cu catalysts. This is in agreement
with previous in operando XES measurements. On the other hand, for
Cu catalysts, a reaction path via an intermediate that simultaneously
coordinates NO and NH3 is available, which is inaccessible
for Fe catalysts.

A distinction between the different pathways
that are feasible
according to the present computational results will require further
spectroscopic and computational studies. Computationally, larger models
of the active site as well as the use of higher accuracy computational
methods could decrease the computational error bars and possibly distinguish
between different pathways. For Fe catalysts, quantum-chemical methods
beyond density-functional theory (DFT) might be required to provide
more accurate spin-state energy differences. Moreover, the determination
of the transition states connecting different intermediates as well
as the calculation of the corresponding activation energies will be
required for a complete picture. Of course, additional reaction pathways
might become possible when considering larger active-site models,
e.g., by involving a second metal center or by allowing for mobile,
NH3-solvated metal centers. Nevertheless, the unified mechanistic
picture provided here will form an ideal starting point for such future
studies.

4 Computational Methods
The molecular
structures of all considered models have been optimized
using DFT as implemented in the Amsterdam density functional program
package,46,47 employing the BP86 generalized-gradient
approximation exchange–correlation functional48,49 in combination with the Slater-type TZ2P basis set.50 Further details on the construction of our model structures
are given in the Supporting Information. All relative energies refer to the differences in the total electronic
energy without additional corrections. For all FeIII species,
the ground state is the high-spin (S = 5/2) state,
whereas for FeII, both the low-spin (S = 0) and the high-spin (S = 2) states were considered.
For all CuI models, we assumed a closed-shell singlet ground
state, whereas for all CuII models, spin-unrestricted calculations
were performed for the doublet (S = 1/2) ground state.
Optimized molecular structures as well as all calculated relative
energies are included in the Supporting Information. For comparison, all calculations have been repeated using the B3LYP
hybrid exchange–correlation functional51 with the same basis set as well as including Grimme’s D3
dispersion correction52 (see the Supporting Information). XES spectra were recorded
using the standard ΔDFT approach53,54 including
higher-order intensity contributions55 with
BP86/QZ4P. Fe K-edge and Cu K-edge spectra have been shifted by 181.34
eV and by 229.14 eV, respectively, to align them with the experimental
energy scale.
