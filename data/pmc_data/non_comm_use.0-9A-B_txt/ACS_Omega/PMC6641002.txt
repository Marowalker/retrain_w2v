We quantified the
concentrations of two little-studied brominated
pollutants, 1,3,5-tribromobenzene (TBB) and 4-bromobiphenyl (4BBP),
in the deep water column and sediments of Lake Geneva. We found aqueous
concentrations of 625 ± 68 pg L–1 for TBB and
668 ± 86 pg L–1 for 4BBP over a depth range
of 70–191.5 m (near-bottom depth), based on duplicate measurements
taken at five depths during three separate 1 month sampling periods
at our sampling site near Vidy Bay. These levels of TBB and 4BBP were
1 or 2 orders of magnitude higher than the quantified aqueous concentrations
of the components of the pentabrominated biphenyl ether technical
mixture, which is a flame retardant product that had a high production
volume in Europe before 2001. We observed statistically significant
vertical concentration trends for both TBB and 2,2′,4,4′,6-pentabromobiphenyl
ether in the deep water column, which indicates that transport and/or
degradation processes affect these compounds. These measurements were
enabled by application of a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatograph
coupled to an electron capture negative chemical ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS) and to a micro-electron
capture detector (GC×GC-μECD). GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS and
GC×GC-μECD were found to be >10× more sensitive
toward
brominated pollutants than conventional GC×GC-EI-TOFMS (with
an electron impact (EI) ionization source), the latter of which had
insufficient sensitivity to detect these emerging brominated pollutants
in the analyzed samples. GC×GC also enabled the estimation of
several environmentally relevant partitioning properties of TBB and
4BBP, further confirming previous evidence that these pollutants are
bioaccumulative and have long-range transport potential.

==== Body
Introduction
Many brominated organic
pollutants have been found to persist in
the environment,1−6 bioaccumulate,2,3 and pose a risk to human health
and ecosystems through their toxicity.2,3,7 Most of these compounds are brominated flame retardants
(BFRs)3,8 or industrial chemicals5,9 having
wide commercial use.4,5 These brominated persistent and
bioaccumulative pollutants (Br-PBPs) may occur in surface water systems
as a result of inputs from urban wastewater and runoff, atmospheric
deposition, and associated long-range transport.10−17 For example, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and/or polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been found in the precipitation and lake
water of the Great Lakes, in biota of the Baltic Sea and North Sea,
in surface waters of the Arctic, and in lake sediments in Europe.10−18 Many of the PBBs and PBDEs have been widely studied for their environmental
fate and behavior.3,19 The production and sale of the
most commonly used PBBs (e.g., Firemaster technical mixture) in the
United States was stopped in 1974,7 and
production in Europe was discontinued after 2000.13 Global restrictions have also been placed on the production
and use of PBDEs, employed as flame retardants (e.g., the pentabrominated
diphenyl ether (pentaBDE) technical mixture).20

However, other potential Br-PBPs are currently produced that
have
undergone little scrutiny for their environmental impact. These include
so-called novel BFRs (NBFRs), which came to be used as replacements
for the discontinued PBDEs and PBBs.21 Howard
and Muir recently identified 80 Br-PBPs of diverse origins that have
annual global production volumes of >1 t year–1 and
were considered as potentially bioaccumulative and persistent in the
environment.4 Among the 80 Br-PBPs, 65
were neither legacy pollutants nor well monitored.4 Hereafter, we refer to these as emerging or novel Br-PBPs.

Despite their importance, Br-PBPs are difficult to measure in environmental
samples due to the complexity of the analyzed matrices and trace concentration
levels of these compounds.12−14,18,22−27 Measurement of Br-PBPs by conventional gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) typically requires intensive cleanup and
fractionation of the environmental sample, which alters the sample
and may compromise the ability to detect and quantify some brominated
pollutants.28 By comparison, the chromatographic
resolution provided by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography
(GC×GC) mitigates the problem of sample complexity and can avert
the need for intensive sample cleanup steps. GC×GC has been shown
to be an effective analytical tool for separation of Br-PBPs in complex
samples.27−33

The choice of instrument detector is an important consideration
for the identification and quantification of Br-PBPs. Mass spectrometry
with electron capture negative chemical ionization (ENCI; also called
ECNI or NCI) in single-ion mode (SIM) is a common detection strategy
for analysis of Br-PBPs in environmental samples, due to the high
sensitivity of ENCI toward halogenated chemicals.28,34−38 However, this detection method can be affected by matrix36,39 and provides less confident analyte identification than that by
electron impact (EI) ionization with the full scan mode. Therefore,
a high degree of chromatographic resolution is needed to ensure confident
identification and quantification of Br-PBPs in complex samples when
employing GC–ENCI-MS with SIM (e.g., as reviewed by Papachlimitzou
et al.28). EI ionization in the full scan
mode provides a higher selectivity compared to that of ENCI with an
SIM, while having a lower sensitivity for Br-PBPs.28,40 Therefore, sample preparation and cleanup become crucial steps during
the analysis of Br-PBPs in environmental samples when using GC–EI-MS
in the full scan mode.

In two recent studies, we developed and
validated a highly sensitive
analytical method for the detection and quantification of trace-level
halogenated hydrocarbons in environmental samples, with limited cleanup.29,30 This method employs a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatograph
coupled to two detectors that are both highly sensitive for halogenated
analytes: an electron capture negative chemical ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS) in the full scan mode and
a micro-electron capture detector (GC×GC-μECD). By employing
limited sample cleanup, we could conduct an analysis that broadly
encompasses several families of nonpolar halogenated analytes. This
approach previously enabled us to successfully detect and quantify
picogram/liter levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons in aquatic samples.29 In comparison, low-resolution GC×GC-TOFMS
with a conventional EI ion source in full scan mode has a poorer sensitivity
toward both chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons.28,31,32

In the present study, we
apply GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS and GC×GC-μECD
for the detection and quantification of a suite of Br-PBPs in samples
from both the water column and sediments of Lake Geneva. These chemical
analysis results are compared to those obtained by GC×GC-EI-TOFMS
with a conventional EI source. The analyzed Br-PBPs include four emerging
brominated pollutants that have received little attention: 1,3,5-tribromobenzene
(TBB), 4-bromobiphenyl (4BBP), hexabromobenzene (HBB), and pentabromoethylbenzene
(PBEB), as well as the five components of the legacy pentaBDE technical
mixture (see Selection of Target Analytes). We report on the concentrations of these Br-PBPs in the deep water
column and sediments at selected locations of Lake Geneva. Finally,
we employ GC×GC to estimate several environmentally relevant
partitioning properties for these emerging Br-PBPs.

Results and Discussion
Comparison
of GC×GC-μECD, GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS,
and GC×GC-EI-TOFMS for Analysis of Br-PBPs in Sediment Extracts
Two sediment samples collected at Sites 1 and 2 (Figure 1) were used to compare analyses
results by GC×GC-μECD, GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS, and GC×GC-EI-TOFMS.
These two sampling sites were both considered likely to have elevated
levels of other persistent pollutants (i.e., chlorinated hydrocarbons
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), on the basis of previous reports.41,42

the location where passive samplers were deployed in the water column
(Site 1), and the outfall of Lausanne’s wastewater treatment
plant (WWTP; 30 m depth). The locations of major communities bordering
the lake are also labeled.

GC×GC-μECD and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS both successfully
detected five of nine target Br-PBPs (4BBP, PBEB, 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl
ether (BDE47), 2,2′,4,4′,5-pentabromodiphenyl ether
(BDE99), and BDE153) in the extracts of the two sediments collected
from Sites 1 and 2 (Table 1). Moreover,
GC×GC-μECD and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS exhibited 100% agreement
in both positive detections (indicating the presence) and negative
detections (indicating the absence) of the nine analyzed Br-PBPs in
both sediment samples (Table 1). In comparison, GC×GC-EI-TOFMS did not detect any of
the nine target Br-PBPs in the same two samples. For both GC×GC-EI-TOFMS
and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS, a target analyte was considered successfully
detected in the sediment extracts if it met five criteria.29 These were as follows: positive matches between
the standard peak and sample analyte peak for retention times in both
the first and second dimensions and positive matches between the standard
peak and target peak for three m/z values, within a tolerance level of 5 mmu (Table S5). The lack of detection of any of the target analytes in
the sediment extracts analyzed by GC×GC-EI-TOFMS was attributed
to the lower sensitivity of EI-TOFMS for Br-PBPs. For GC×GC-μECD,
an analyte was considered detected if there was a positive match of
the retention times in first and second dimensions between the standard
peak and suspect peak in the sample.29

Further
confirming the above results, GC×GC-μECD and
GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS were both found to be more sensitive than GC×GC-EI-TOFMS
by more than an order of magnitude for Br-PBPs (Section S7). GC×GC-μECD produced LODi values that were 34–61 times lower than those achieved by
GC×GC-EI-TOFMS for the nine Br-PBP analytes (Table 1). Similarly, GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS
gave LODi values 22–40 times lower than those achieved
by GC×GC-EI-TOFMS. The excellent sensitivity of GC×GC-μECD
and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS for Br-PBPs thus enabled confident detection
of several brominated analytes in sediment samples. This was not possible
by GC×GC-EI-TOFMS with the sample preparation protocols employed
here.

Finally, we employed GC×GC-μECD and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS
for analysis of three passive sampler extracts deployed near the bed
of the lake (191.5 m depth) during June, July, and August, 2011. Using
the detection criteria discussed above, we successfully detected eight
of nine target analytes in the water column of the lake. We observed
100% agreement
between GC×GC-μECD and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS for both positive
detections and negative detections for all individual Br-PBPs in all
three analyzed passive sampler extracts (Table S5). As was found with sediment extracts (above), this procedure
confirmed our ability to confidently detect Br-PBPs in the water column.

Quantification of Br-PBPs in the Sediments and Water Column
GC×GC-μECD has been employed previously for quantification
of trace-level halogenated pollutants in complex environmental samples.29,30,33,40,45 However, recent studies have revealed the
importance of applying appropriate data processing to the GC×GC
chromatogram prior to analyte quantification.29,46 Therefore, all chromatograms were baseline-corrected with Eilers
baseline,47,48 using a freely available code49 implemented in Matlab.50 The three unitless algorithm parameters, λ, p, and d, were set to 104, 0.02, and 2,
respectively. The Eilers baseline is effective for eliminating poorly
resolved background signals in complex samples analyzed by GC×GC.29,46 After baseline correction, the analyte peaks were integrated with
the inverted watershed algorithm implemented in GC Image software48 (Table S4). This
combination of baseline-correction and peak-integration algorithms
was recently shown to give good performance for analyte quantification
by GC×GC-μECD.29 We used external
standard calibration at five concentration levels, with three replicates
at each level, for the quantification of the target analytes in the
environmental samples.29

Using this
approach, we successfully quantified up to four of nine target Br-PBPs
in the four sediment extracts and up to seven of nine target Br-PBPs
in the thirty passive samplers that had been deployed in the water
column with GC×GC-μECD (Figure S2 and Tables 2 and S7). A target analyte was considered quantifiable
if its integrated GC×GC-μECD signal in the environmental
sample was more than three times the sum of the target analyte signal
in the blanks. The effective limit of quantification (LOQe) values were 3.5–4.0 pg g–1 for sediment
samples and 1.0–50 pg L–1 for water column
extracts, depending on the analyte (Table S5). The achieved LOQe values in the present study were
nearly 30× lower than the reported LOQe values for
conventional GC–MS with SIM.28 Exceptionally,
due to the apparent blank contamination (for water column extracts)
and matrix effect (for sediment samples), we report BDE47 as nonquantified;
see Section S8 of the Supporting Information
for further explanation.

Occurrence
of Target Br-PBPs in Lake Geneva Sediments
On the basis of
analyte quantifications by GC×GC-μECD,
the concentrations of 4BBP, PBEB, BDE99, and BDE153 in the sediment
samples collected from the deep lake (Site 2) and near the urbanized
area of Lausanne (Site 1) were elevated compared to the Br-PBP levels
in samples collected from near the Rhône River delta (Sites
3 and 4), as shown in Table 2. The observed concentration distributions at these four sampling
sites suggest that the Rhône River is not the principal input
of these pollutants into Lake Geneva, as the Rhône is the major
tributary that flows over Sites 3 and 4. However, the observed concentration
differences in the four analyzed locations may be confounded by the
different sedimentation rates at these sites, and the results of the
statistically small number of samples reported here should not be
overinterpreted. The highest measured 4BBP concentration in the Lake
Geneva sediment samples (187.0 pg g–1) exceeded
the highest 4BBP concentration reported in the River Daqing sediment
samples in China (40 pg g–1). For BDE99, we observed
sediment concentrations in Lake Geneva samples (15.5–89.6 pg
g–1) to be lower than those in samples from some
US, Canadian, and other European lakes and rivers (Table 2).15−17,51,52 For BDE153, we observed
sediment levels that were 3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported
in Llobergat River, Spain (17 000 pg g–1, Table 2).

Concentrations
and Trends of Target Br-PBPs in the Deep Water
Column of Lake Geneva
At Site 1, both TBB and 4BBP were found
to have aqueous concentrations exceeding 600 pg L–1 in the deep water column (>70 m depth), which is 1 or 2 orders
of
magnitude higher than the aqueous concentrations of the analyzed legacy
pentaBDEs (Figure 2 and Table S7). The depth-averaged concentration
of TBB was 668 ± 86 pg L–1, and the depth-averaged
concentration of 4BBP was 625 ± 68 pg L–1,
on the basis of measurements during three separate 1 month sampling
periods (Figure 2).
For PBEB, the concentration was 7 ± 1.8 pg L–1, and HBB was not detected (LODe = 30 pg L–1). By comparison, the measured aqueous concentrations of the pentaBDEs
ranged from 2 ± 0.8 pg L–1 (HBBP) to 27 ±
7 pg L–1 (BDE99). These aqueous concentrations of
pentaBDEs are comparable to those reported in the waters of all five
Great Lakes10,55 and in some rivers and lakes
in Europe, including Lakes Thun and Greifensee in Switzerland.14,16 Much higher aqueous concentrations of pentaBDE compounds have been
reported in waters of Niuchao Lake, China (4020 pg L–1 in winter and 520 pg L–1 in summer).56

Figure 2 Average measured aqueous concentrations (Caq (pg L–1)) of the target Br-PBPs at
Site
1 (Figure 1). The error
bars show the concentration variability (±2 standard deviations)
over thirty water column samples taken at five different depths during
three sampling periods (June, July, and August, 2011).

We observed statistically significant vertical
trends in the aqueous
concentrations of both TBB and BDE100 over the sampled depth range
of 70–191.5 m at Site 1 (Figure 3), on the basis of a linear regression of depth versus
concentration for each Br-PBP. A vertical concentration trend was
considered to be present if the 95% confidence interval57 of the regression slope parameter was found
to not span zero. The remaining detected Br-PBPs, 4BBP, PBEB, and
BDE99, did not exhibit a discernible trend at Site 1, on the basis
of this criterion (Figures 3 and S3). Additionally, results
from a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test58 indicated that the concentration distributions of TBB,
4BBP, PBEB, BDE99, and BDE100 did not change significantly over the
3 month period of June, July, and August, 2011. The temporal stability
of the water concentrations further supports the conclusion that the
vertical concentration trends are statistically meaningful.

(c) BDE99, and (d) BDE100 at Site 1. The error bars indicate the observed
concentration variability (95% confidence interval) over the 3 month
sampling period. The dotted line shows the depth of the lake bottom
at the sampling site.

Spatial trends in contaminant concentrations are physically
meaningful
because they express processes that transport and/or degrade pollutants
in the lake system. For example, the observed trends of decreasing
concentrations of TBB and BDE100 with increasing depth may result
from the active removal of these compounds by biodegradation in the
anaerobic sediments at the lake floor. This interpretation is consistent
with the finding that neither TBB nor BDE100 was detected in the sediments
at any of the four sampling sites (Table 2), implying that their concentrations in
the sediments were lower than those expected based on equilibrium
partitioning with the water column (Table S8). Additional data and modeling analysis would be needed to attribute
confidently the processes that explain the vertical concentration
trends of the Br-PBPs in the water column at Site 1 in Lake Geneva.

Limited published data are available on the spatial concentration
trends or gradients of hydrophobic compounds in aquatic systems, especially
the deep water column, because the aqueous concentrations of these
compounds are difficult to sample and quantify reliably. Published
water column measurements of Br-PBPs in lakes are limited to surface
samples having depths <10 m.10,55,56,59−62 However, previous modeling efforts
have indicated that hydrophobic compounds could exhibit vertical gradients
in large aquatic or marine systems, due to the simultaneous influences
of currents and turbulent mixing, air–water exchange, atmospheric
deposition, sedimentation, and/or transformation reactions.63−66 The high sensitivity of GC×GC-μECD produced precise quantifications
of Br-PBP analytes, and this allowed us to establish spatial trends
of Br-PBP concentrations in the water column. This would have been
more difficult (or impossible) with conventional analytical methods
such as GC–MS.

Potential Sources and Sinks of TBB and 4BBP
in Lakes
Little is known about the global production and
distribution of TBB
and 4BBP. Both chemicals have estimated global production volumes
of >1 t year–1,4 and
they are mainly produced in China.67 TBB
is used as a reagent in the production of different pharmaceuticals
and personal-care products.68,69 TBB is also used as
an added flame retardant together with HBB during the production of
organic polymers.70,71 4BBP is utilized in the industrial
synthesis of other chemicals, including rodenticides, pharmaceuticals,
and personal-care products.72−74 TBB and 4BBP are additionally
known to be anaerobic dehalogenation products of HBB and HBBP, after
several successive dehalogenation reactions.75−79 PBEB and HBB are currently still in use as NBFRs.3

The presence of TBB and 4BBP in Lake Geneva
is unlikely to be explained by dehalogenation of higher brominated
congeners. Although TBB and 4BBP are dehalogenation products of HBB
and HBBP, respectively, they are not the main products of these pathways.75−79 Additionally, in our search of the GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS data of
the analyzed sediment samples, we failed to find the target ions for
1,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzene and 2,2-dibromobiphenyl (on the basis of
the masses reported in literature78,79), which are
the transformation intermediates that would be expected to produce
TBB and 4BBP upon dehalogenation, respectively.75−79 Therefore the surprisingly high levels of TBB and
4BBP in the water column are unlikely to be explained by in situ production
of these compounds through the anaerobic dehalogenation of HBB and
HBBP, respectively.

Anaerobic dehalogenation is likely to be
a potential sink for both
TBB and 4BBP in anaerobic lake sediments, on the basis of their structural
similarities to BFRs that are known to degrade via this pathway.80−82 Anaerobic dehalogenation has been measured in the laboratory for
4BBP.76,77 No information is available concerning the
rates of direct photolysis for either TBB or 4BBP. However, this process
merits investigation, as structurally similar brominated compounds
have environmentally relevant rates of direct photolysis (Table S10).67,83

Bioaccumulation
Potential, Long-Range Transport Potential (LRTP),
and Arctic Contamination Potential (ACP) of TBB and 4BBP
GC×GC presents a unique opportunity to analyze for Br-PBPs and
simultaneously estimate several environmentally relevant partitioning
properties of these compounds. For TBB and 4BBP, few partitioning
property data have been reported in the literature. Therefore, to
expand upon the preliminary assessment of Howard and Muir,4 we compiled several environmentally relevant
property data based on the available literature data and multiple
estimation methods, including a recently developed property estimation
method based on GC×GC retention times84 (Tables 3 and S10, Section S10). Both TBB and 4BBP meet the
criteria for environmental persistence in aerobic environments, according
to an estimated atmospheric oxidation half-life of >1 day and expert
judgment (see refs (4) and (85)). According
to partitioning property estimates by GC×GC, TBB and 4BBP were
found to have both LRTP and ACP, as defined by the following criteria:
4 < log Kow < 8, 6 < log Koa < 9, and −3 < log Kaw < 1.6 TBB was
identified previously as a potential Arctic contaminant by
Wania.6 Additionally, the previously reported
detection of TBB in a snow core in Nunavut, Canada,9 may be viewed as supporting evidence for its potential
for long-range transport and associated Arctic contamination. Other
target analytes, pentaBDEs, HBB, and PBEB, have been previously investigated
for LRTP and ACP.9,18,59,86−88

According to chemical property estimates provided
by GC×GC
(Table 3), TBB and
4BBP meet the bioaccumulation potential criteria set by Howard and
Muir,4 defined as log Kow > 3 and BCF > 500. These more conservative criteria
compared to those in REACH (i.e., BCF > 200089) include a larger number of chemicals as potential bioaccumulative
pollutants. 4BBP
has been reportedly found in tissues of human cancer patients in China90 and in human breast milk in Denmark and Finland,91 which is consistent with its predicted tendency
to bioaccumulate. Biotic occurrence data are absent for TBB. However
TBB is the brominated analogue of trichlorobenzene, which is considered
bioaccumulative and persistent.92 PBEB,
HBB, HBBP, and pentaBDEs have been found to bioaccumulate in the environment
on the basis of both their properties and their previously reported
occurrences in biotic media.25,51,52,86,88,93−104

Implications
The combination of GC×GC-μECD
and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS was found to be a sensitive and selective
analytical approach for the detection and quantification of Br-PBPs
in complex environmental samples with limited cleanup. Conventional
methods that are used for sample preparation and analysis of halogenated
organic pollutants are optimized for specific chemical families. By
comparison, the method proposed in the present study enables simultaneous
analysis of a wide range of nonpolar halogenated target analytes,
thanks to the limited cleanup step. The successful detection and quantification
of TBB and 4BBP was made possible by the higher sensitivity and selectivity
of GC×GC-μECD and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS for halogenated
PBPs compared to those of GC×GC-EI-TOFMS and/or conventional
GC–MS. Additionally, GC×GC enabled the estimation of several
environmentally relevant chemical and physical properties for TBB
and 4BBP. Finally, the mass spectrum data recorded by GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS
enabled retrospective analysis of both the passive samplers and sediment
samples for additional suspect analytes, which enabled us to rule
out debromination of higher brominated congeners as a potential source
of TBB and 4BBP.

Experimental Methods
Selection of Target Analytes
We performed a prioritization
screening of the 65 novel Br-PBPs listed in the Howard and Muir study.4 The screening criteria were that chemicals must
be (1) amenable to GC−μECD without derivatization; (2)
neutral; (3) thermally stable; (4) available as analytical chemical
standards from research chemical suppliers; (5) registered in the
European Union’s Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization
and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) database; (6) and not banned
from production in Europe. Applying these criteria led to four high-priority
novel Br-PBPs: TBB, 4BBP, HBB, and PBEB. More details regarding the
screening protocol are provided in Section S1 and Table S1 of the Supporting Information.

We additionally
analyzed the legacy pentaBDE technical mixture, which consists of
BDE47, BDE99, BDE100, BDE153, and HBBP. Throughout the present article
we refer to this technical mixture as “pentaBDEs”. These
compounds had a historically high volume of production14 and have been investigated widely in the environment
in different parts of the world,14,18,109 including Switzerland,14,18,109 due to their toxicity,110,111 bioaccumulation potential,16,25,112,113 and persistence in the environment.12,14,18,26 Our findings on pentaBDEs provide a point of comparison for interpreting
the levels of novel Br-PBPs in Lake Geneva. A list of chemical suppliers
for all target analytes is given in the Supporting Information.

Sampling Locations
Lake Geneva is
one of the largest
fresh surface water resources in Europe, having a surface area of
580 km2 and a maximum depth of 310 m.114 It is the main drinking water source for more than 520 000
people (Figure S1).115 Commercial and recreational fishing in Lake Geneva together
amount to approximately 1000 tons of fish per year.116

We collected sediment cores from four locations of
the lake (Figure 1),
using either a Benthos gravity corer from a surface vessel (Sites
1–4) or a tube core from the robotic arm of a human-occupied
Mir submersible (Site 2) during the Elemo field campaign in the summer
of 2011.114 The sediment samples were collected
from locations having total depths of 192 m (Site 1), 310 m (Site
2), 236 m (Site 3), and 188 m (Site 4). Site 1 was located at 46.4945°N
and 6.5796°E (World Geodetic System, WGS84), Site 2 was located
at 46.4390°N and 6.6130°E, Site 3 was located at 46.4183°N
and 6.7801°E, and Site 4 was located at 46.4345°N and 6.8551°E.
Site 1 was at about a 2000 m distance from the lake shore and a 1200
m distance from the effluent discharge of Lausanne’s Vidy WWTP,
which serves a population equivalent of approximately 220 000
(Figures 1 and S1). The second sediment sampling site (Site
2) was located near the center of the deep lake. Sites 3 and 4 were
located farther east and are likely affected by pollutant inputs from
the Rhone river tributary and also the coastal cities of that region.
All sediment samples, after collection, were brought immediately to
the lab and stored at −20 °C until extraction for analysis.

We also sampled the deep water column of the lake by deploying
passive samplers at Site 1 (Figures 1 and S1). This sampling
location was chosen because it is likely influenced by pollutant inputs
originating from urban runoff and the WWTP of the city of Lausanne.
However, this location was sufficiently distant from the shore such
that it also mixes regularly with the waters of the central lake,
which are affected by other pollutant inputs, such as those from the
Rhône River, agricultural runoff, cities of the French coast
(e.g., Evian), and atmospheric deposition.42,117−120 In the summer of 2011, during each of the months of June, July,
and August, we deployed two passive samplers at five different water
depths of 70, 132, 172, 178, and 191.5 m. Each passive sampler had
an exposure time of 1 month. The deepest sampling point was 0.5 m
above the sediment bed, which had a total water depth of 192 m. We
were not permitted to
place samplers at depths less than 70 m due to the operation of fishing
trawlers. To deploy the passive samplers, we used a stainless steel
chain connected to a buoy and a stainless steel bottom release. To
protect the passive samplers from biofilm formation and bioturbation,
the passive samplers were placed inside solvent-prewashed stainless
steel cages. The cages were then deployed at the desired depths.

Water Column Sampling
Passive samplers are often employed
for measurement of persistent and bioaccumulative pollutants in aquatic
systems, due to their low expense, ease of storage and transport,
and stability over time.121−124 The rate constant describing pollutant uptake
into the passive samplers from the water column (ke) was estimated based on the extent of disappearance
of several performance reference compounds (PRCs) from the passive
samplers during the sampling period (see eq 1 in Section S4 of the Supporting Information).125−127 For further information, see the Sample Preparation
and Cleanup section and also Section S4 of the Supporting Information.

Sample Preparation and
Cleanup
Extraction of Sediment Samples and Cleanup
We culled
sediment from the top 1 cm of each of the four collected sediment
cores. Only the center section of the sediment core was taken, thereby
excluding the sediment in contact with the plastic walls of the coring
tube. The resulting sediment samples had a dry weight of approximately
5 g each. These samples were air dried and then homogenized (EPA method
EPA-823-B-01-002, revision of October 2001). Each homogenized dried
sample (0.5 g) was extracted using accelerated solvent extraction,
which was a modified version of EPA Method 3545A, revision 1, February
2007.30 We employed an extraction mixture
of acetone and hexane that has been proposed previously for organochlorinated
pesticides in sediment samples. We omitted the alumina, silica gel,
and gel permeation chromatography (i.e., fractionation) and sulfur
cleanup steps that would be usually applied with EPA Method 3545A
so that the resulting extracts could be analyzed broadly for several
classes of nonpolar halogenated compounds, including Br-PBPs. Further
method details are given in Section S5 of
the Supporting Information.

Extraction of the Passive
Samplers Deployed in the Water Column
For passive sampling
of the water column, we used PDMS sheets (AlteSil
Laboratory Sheet, U.K.) of 5 mm thickness. PDMS exhibits linear mass
transfer behavior over a wide range of sorbate Kow values.128,129 The PDMS sheets were cut into
strips of 10 × 1 × 0.05 cm3, each of which had
a weight of 1.98 ± 0.20 g. The strips were then cleaned using
Soxhlet extraction with methanol for 24 h130−133 and subsequently stored at −20 °C. Five cleaned strips
were then immediately extracted, and these are referred to as the
PDMS blank. Before field deployment, we loaded each of the PDMS strips
with four PRCs (PCB 30, PCB 50, PCB 145, and PCB 204) to a concentration
of 20 ng g–1 of each PRC. The details of the PRC
loading process are explained elsewhere.127 After the loading step, five strips were used to determine the initial
PRC concentrations in the strips. After deployment in the lake, extraction
of each of the deployed strips was carried out by soaking the strips
in 20 mL of pentane for 8 h three consecutive times. The volume of
the final extract (60 mL) was reduced to 1 mL by rotary evaporation
and simultaneously solvent-exchanged to hexane. The final extract
was stored at −20 °C until analysis. We did not perform
any cleanup step on the final extract.

For quality assurance,
we analyzed four different types of blanks. These were as follows:
the five PDMS blanks (explained above); the solvent blanks, which
were the solvents used for extraction (pentane and hexane); three
field blanks, which were extracts of loaded strips brought to the
field but not deployed; and the method blank, which was a solvent
extract of the glassware used for the extraction and rotary evaporation.

GC×GC-μECD and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS Analysis
We analyzed our environmental samples with a Leco Corp GC×GC-μECD
instrument equipped with a modified Agilent 7890A GC system having
a split/splitless injector and a dual-stage, quadruple-jet modulator.
The Leco GC×GC had a 30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter (i.d.),
0.25 μm film thickness RTX-1 column (Restek, USA) as the first
dimension and a 2 m length, 0.1 mm i.d., 0.1 μm film thickness
BPX-50 column as the second dimension (Restek).

GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS
and GC×GC-EI-TOFMS analyses were both performed using a Zoex
(Zoex Corp.) instrument. This instrument was a modified Agilent 7890A
GC system with a loop thermal modulator supplied by Zoex. The TOFMS
was made by TOFWERK, Switzerland, and it was equipped with both an
EI source and ENCI source. The column set and temperature program
were similar to those used for GC×GC-μECD measurements.
When used with either an EI or ENCI source, the TOFMS exhibited a
mass precision of ± 5 mmu for the target masses that we investigated.
Further instrument details are reported in Section S6 of the Supporting Information. These analyses provided us
with the bases for the comparison of the combination of GC×GC-μECD
and GC×GC-ENCI-TOFMS with conventional GC×GC-EI-TOFMS.

Chemical Property Estimation
We compiled chemical property
data for all analyzed Br-PBPs, including previously reported measurement
values and also several model estimates. For TBB, 4BBP, PBEB, HBB,
and BDE47, all of which have a boiling point of <402 °C, several
partitioning properties were estimated from GC×GC retention times
using a methodology that we have reported previously,84 as described in Section 10 of
the Supporting Information. Partitioning properties were also estimated
for all investigated Br-PBPs with EPISuite.105 We also assessed the Br-PBPs for aerobic persistence using BioWin105 and the expert judgment criteria for biodegradability
potential.4,85 This provides a tabulation of environmentally
relevant physical and chemical property estimates and/or experimentally
measured values for TBB, 4BBP, PBEB, and HBB and the components of
the pentaBDE technical mixture according to several different methods.
