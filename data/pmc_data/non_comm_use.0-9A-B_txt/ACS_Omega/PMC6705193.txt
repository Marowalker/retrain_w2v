Metal-based multinuclear
supramolecules with different functionalities
designed by self-assembly represent a growing area of research due
to their versatile applications, particularly as anticancer agents.
Four novel boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-based octacationic heterometallic
molecular squares, 3–6 were synthesized by self-assembly
via reaction of dipyridyl BODIPY ligands with suitable 90° palladium
and platinum acceptors. The formation of the as-synthesized molecular
squares was confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental
analysis, high resolution electrospray mass spectrometry, UV–vis
spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The square molecular
structures of 4 and 6 were further rationalized
theoretically using the PM7 semi-empirical method. The activities
of the supramolecules against cancer cells were tested using cell
lines of various malignant and nonmalignant origins. Complexes 3–6 showed high cytotoxicity toward cancer cells but
7.0 to 15.2 times lower cytotoxic effects were observed against nonmalignant
human kidney epithelial cells (HEK-293). Particularly, complexes 3–6 provided 2.1–6.0 times lower IC50 values as compared to cisplatin in HCT116 cells. Interestingly,
BDP ligand-containing complexes (3 and 4) induced cytotoxicity through apoptosis, whereas BDPCC-based complexes
(5 and 6) induced cell death by necrosis.
This study presents a novel series of iron-based heteroatomic palladium
and platinum complexes that exhibit substantial potential as drug
candidates for anticancer therapy.

Introduction
Coordination-driven
self-assembly for the design of multinuclear
well-defined molecular structures is a convenient technique to develop
large interesting supramolecules and metal organic compounds.1−6 Among the studied self-assembled supramolecules, macrocycles are
commonly used owing to their different functionalities, which can
be finely tuned based on the chemical and physical requirements.1−8 Since the initial development of palladium-based square-shaped macrocycles
by Fujita et al. and Stang and Cao9,10 via self-assembly,
several macrocycles with distinct triangular, square, and cage-type
architectures have been reported.11−13 The size, shape, and
functions of these architectures vary depending on the ligand and
metal center used for the assembly.2−8,11,12 The overall properties of the architectures can be engineered to
exhibit interesting physical and chemical properties that differ from
those of the individual constituent materials.

Boron dipyrromethene
(BODIPY) is a class of excellent fluorophores
with important applications varying from biological labeling to light
harvesting.14−16 Its physical and chemical properties together with
its high stability are responsible for the attractiveness of this
fluorescent material.17,18 The central BODIPY core can be
extended further by adding different functionalizations without significant
change to its optical properties. Recently, pyridine-functionalized
BODIPY ligands were introduced by Hupp et al. to develop metal–organic
frameworks with interesting light-harvesting properties.19 More recently, Lee et al. introduced dipyridyl
BODIPY ligands for the synthesis of self-assembled ruthenium and iridium
metalla-rectangles for anticancer applications.20−24 Furthermore, Nitschke et al. developed several BODIPY-based
metal supramolecules with sensing, host–guest, and other interesting
physical properties.25−27 Although several BODIPY ligands have been used to
develop metal-based supramolecules, macrocycles based on palladium
or platinum metals have been rarely reported. Pistolis et al. designed
the first BODIPY-based platinum macrocycles with a square architecture
that exhibited interesting physical properties.28 Since this first report, the same group has developed several
other square and hexagonal architectures and studied their physical
properties, including the host–guest chemistry.29,30 Additionally, only a few studies have been reported where the biological
activities of palladium or platinum macrocycles based on BODIPY are
investigated.31,32

Furthermore, a biological
study of heterometallic macrocycles containing
palladium or platinum with diphenyl ferrocenyl moieties was recently
reported by Chi and co-workers.33 Herein,
we present a novel series of diphenyl ferrocene-appended heteroatomic
palladium and platinum complexes with square architectures synthesized
from dipyridyl BODIPY ligands. The abilities of the synthesized supramolecules
against proliferating cancer cells were determined and compared with
those obtained from standard cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, their
abilities to penetrate the cell membrane were investigated and examination
of the probable mechanism of cell death was attempted.

Results and Discussion
The reaction of heterometallic palladium iron triflate complex 1 and platinum iron triflate complex 2 with dipyridyl
BODIPY (BDP and BDPCC) ligands in a mixed dichloromethane/nitromethane
solution under nitrogen formed four novel self-assembled square complexes 3–6 (Scheme 1). The octanuclear complexes were isolated in good yields
as their triflate salts and are soluble in common organic solvents.
The complexes were fully characterized using different analytical
techniques. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy was used to examine the
formation and purity of the new complexes. The 1H NMR spectra
of complexes 3–6 in CDCl3 showed characteristic
peaks corresponding to the starting precursor and BODIPY ligands (Experimental Section and Figure S1).

Molecular Squares 3–6 from 1, 2, BDP, and BDPCC
In addition, 31P and 19F NMR were used to
confirm the formation of these macrocycles (Figure 1). The 31P NMR of the starting
palladium precursor 1 showed a peak at 46.90 ppm. However,
after self-assembly, this peak shifted upfield by approximately 13
ppm and peaks centered at 33.06 and 32.50 ppm appeared for 3 and 5, respectively. Similarly, the platinum precursor 2 showed a peak at 8.76 ppm, which after complexation with
BDP and BDPCC ligands shifted upfield to peaks at 4.15 and 3.60 ppm
for macrocycles 4 and 6, respectively. This
upfield shift together with the single peak in the 31P
NMR confirmed the presence of symmetric phosphorus nuclei in macrocycles 3–6. Similarly, the 19F NMR showed a sharp
singlet at approximately −78 ppm, corresponding to the fluorine
atom of the triflate molecule. In addition, a quartet between −145.85
and −146.19 ppm was observed in the 19F NMR spectra,
originating from the fluorine atom of the BODIPY ligands in 3–6.

of complexes 1–6 in acetone-d6.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI–MS) was used
to confirm the formation of these macrocycles. ESI–MS spectra
in acetonitrile showed tri-, tetra-, hexa-, and octa-cationic peaks
corresponding to the loss of three to eight triflate anions. The peaks
were centered at m/z 1287.57 and
569.16 for 3; m/z 1335.59
and 593.17 for 4; m/z 1376.68 and 613.68 for 5; and m/z 1424.60 and 637.75 for 6, originating from
the tetra- and octacationic fragmentation, respectively. In addition,
complex 4 showed a tricationic peak centered at m/z 1829.30, corresponding to the loss
of three triflate anions, and the peaks centered at m/z 897.84 and 748.98 corresponded to the loss of
six and seven triflate anions, respectively, for complex 6. The details of the peak assignments for these complexes are provided
in the Experimental Section, and their spectra
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

The photophysical properties of the free BODIPY
ligands and prepared
metal supramolecules were studied at room temperature in methanol
solution. The absorption spectra of the supramolecules shown in Figure 2 exhibited major
absorption peaks at around 518 nm for 3 and 4 and 556 nm for 5 and 6. These peaks originated
from the BODIPY ligands present in these supramolecules and were assigned
to the vibration band of the π–π* transition localized
on the BODIPY chromophore. The emission properties of the free ligands
and their corresponding metal complexes were also studied in methanol
and are shown in Figure 2. The complexes were highly emissive due to the presence of the BODIPY
chromophores. The emission peaks were centered at approximately 533
nm for 3 and 4 and 575 nm for 5 and 6.

Our attempts to grow crystals
suitable for single crystal X-ray
study were not successful, so we investigated the structure of platinum-based
complexes 4 and 6 using the PM7 semi-empirical
method implemented in the Gaussian 16 software package.34,35 As expected from the molecular skeleton structures of 4 and 6 (see Scheme 1), we successfully obtained square structures from
geometry optimizations, which were performed without symmetry constraints
(Figure 3). The molecular
size was estimated from the nearest Pt–Pt distance: 19.5 and
24.6 Å for 4 and 6, respectively. A
variety of orientations of the BODIPY moiety were considered to obtain
further insight into the structures of complexes 4 and 6 (Figure S3a,b). The geometric
parameters related to the square structures are listed in Table S1. The torsional angles for the four Pt
ions and interior angles for the local minimum structures of complex 4 (∼87°–93°) and 6 (∼90°)
indicate that all molecular complexes adopted a square geometry. The
interplanar angles between the square plane of four Pt ions and BODIPY
moiety showed that steric hindrance is considerable in complex 4 compared to that of complex 6. The interplanar
angles for the local minimum structures of complex 4 were
determined to be ∼32°–52°, indicating a more
tilted geometry of BODIPY from the perpendicular orientation with
respect to the square plane of the complex compared to that of complex 6 (∼68°–73°). The strong effect of
steric hindrance on the stability of complex 4 compared
to that of complex 6 was also reflected in the larger
variation of the relative energies in complex 4 depending
on the orientation of BODIPY, ranging between ∼13 and ∼0.2
kcal/mol for complexes 4 and 6 (Figure S3a,b). Therefore, introducing the ethynyl
group between the BODIPY and pyridyl groups may reduce the steric
hindrance between the methyl groups of BODIPY and pyridyl group and
leads to increased coplanarity of the BODIPY plane with the pyridyl
group, which is favorable for improving the π-conjugated network.

square geometries of complexes (a) 4 and (b) 6.

Owing to the growing interest
and popularity of self-assembled
metalla-architectures in biological systems, the anticancer properties
of the synthesized complexes were studied in vitro. The cytotoxic
activities of the prepared supramolecules were evaluated after incubation
for 48 h with cancer cells of various origins: colorectal carcinoma
(HCT116), prostrate adenocarcinoma (PC-3), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7),
and lung adenocarcinoma (A549) (Figure 4). To qualify as a potent anticancer drug candidate,
a complex must efficiently reduce the viability of cancer cells and
exhibit minimal effects on the proliferation of normal cells. However,
various metal-based anticancer agents cause significant toxicity to
the normal cells. For example, cisplatin (cis-diamine-dichloro-platinum)
exhibits cytotoxicity toward nonmalignant human embryonic kidney cells
(HEK-293).36,37 Therefore, the respective cytotoxicities
of 3–6 on cancer cells are compared with those
obtained with nonmalignant HEK-293 cells. As indicated in Figure 4 and Table 1, all supramolecules show strong
cytotoxic activities in all cell lines after 48 h incubation and high
IC50 values of supramolecules were almost similar comparing
the standard drug, cisplatin in most of the tested cells. For instance,
the supramolecules inhibit the proliferation of HCT116, PC-3, and
A549 with activity that is 2.1–6.0, 0.7–4.0, and 0.9–5.6
times, respectively, better than cisplatin. However, the IC50 values are higher by approximately 9.5–15.2 and 1.0–2.8
times, as compared to cisplatin for the HEK-293 and MCF-7 cells, respectively.
More specifically, complex 4 shows 6.0, 4.0, and 3.7
times higher cytotoxicity toward HCT116, PC-3, and A549 cells, respectively,
compared with cisplatin. However, it shows a slightly lower toxic
effect against HEK-293 and MCF-7 cells. Overall, complexes show lower
IC50 values against HCT116 and A549 comparing PC-3 and
MCF-7 cells, exhibiting their selective cytotoxic affinities toward
proliferating colorectal and lung cancer cells. Above all, our compounds
were found to be 7.0 to 15.2 times less toxic than cisplatin in normal
cells (HEK-293), and at the same time, have strong cytotoxicity in
cancer cells.

To identify the mechanism of cell death by
the supramolecules,
annexin-V FITC and propidium iodide (PI) dual-staining was conducted
to distinguish between apoptosis- and necrosis-caused cell death by
flow cytometry. Necrosis-based cell death was observed when cisplatin
was used to treat HCT116 cells and the population of necrotic cells
increased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5). Interestingly, cisplatin-induced necrosis
was identified in the A549 cells exposed to 10 μM cisplatin,
but significant apoptosis was observed when the dose was increased
to 1 mM. Complexes 3 and 4 induced apoptosis
in both HCT116 and A549 cells; both cell lines treated with complexes 5 and 6 displayed significant necrosis. Together,
these experiments demonstrate that BDP ligand-containing complexes 3 and 4 exhibit cytotoxicity through apoptosis,
but BDPCC-based complexes 5 and 6 induce
cell death by necrosis.

and cisplatin.

When a fluorescent material shows
cytotoxicity in cancer cells,
the mechanism of action within the cells can be understood more easily
via visualization using autofluorescence. In this regard, BODIPY-based
complexes are easier to work with than the popular platinum-based
anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, as the processes
of translocation and drug release can be easily tracked in BODIPY-based
complexes.20,21,31,32 Based on their emission properties described
in Figure 2, the intracellular
penetration of 3–6 was validated. Confocal laser
scanning microscopy investigations were performed on all types of
cells previously tested (HEK-293, HCT116, PC-3, MCF-7, and A549) with
complexes 3–6. Counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) was performed to demarcate the nuclei. As seen in Figure 6, no fluorescence
was detected in the untreated/control cells, except for that originating
from the counterstain. In contrast, all cells treated with complexes 3–6 for 1 h displayed strong intracellular fluorescence,
but fluorescence was not observed in the nuclei. These results indicate
that complexes 3–6 were able to penetrate the
cell membrane but failed to compromise the nuclear barrier. The results
also indicate that the cell killing mechanism of all complexes was
extranuclear. Previously, we obtained similar results using highly
cytotoxic Pd-complexes localized in the cytoplasm of HeLa, MCF-7,
and U87 cells.32 In this study, endocytosis
may be the major mechanism of internalization. The cationic nature
of the complexes is likely favorable for the cellular uptake because
the potential of cell membrane is negative.38

(scale bar = 50 μm).

Determination of the biological activity of any organometallic
complex largely relies on the understanding of its stability in biological
media. To obtain more information regarding the stabilities of the
synthesized supramolecules, 3–6 were pre-incubated
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or complete cell culture medium (RPMI
1640) at 100 μM for 0, 12, 24, or 48 h at 37 °C. Cytotoxic
activities were then examined, as described in the Experimental Section against HCT116 cells. As shown in Figure 7, the cytotoxic activities
of the complexes after preincubation in DMSO increased with the increasing
preincubation time. On the other hand, the activities declined with
preincubation time when the complexes were incubated in complete cell
culture medium. Moreover, after incubation in DMSO, the cytotoxic
activities were relatively stable for up to 48 h, likely because of
the nonpolar nature of DMSO, allowing the complexes to be well dispersed.
This is in contrast to the water-based culture media, where the relatively
less soluble organometallic complexes tend to precipitate, leading
to a reduced biological activity. Thus, we expect that the latter
mechanism may have retarded the cell membrane penetration efficacy
due to some precipitation.

complexes in
HCT116 cells. (a) 3, (b) 4, (c) 5, and (d) 6. Red circles (●): supramolecules
in DMSO, black squares (■): supramolecules in RPMI 1640.

In support of the aforementioned observations,
understanding the
structural stability of the complexes under oxidative and reducing
conditions is important. Thus, the fluorescence spectra of 3–6 in DMSO, 10 μM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in DMSO, 10 μM dithiothreitol (DTT) in DMSO, phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and complete cell culture medium were analyzed (Figure 8).33 As shown in Figure 8, the maximum emission spectra of complexes 3, 4, and 6 are observed in DMSO and these
slightly decrease under oxidative (H2O2) or
reducing (DTT) conditions. Complex 5 shows the maximum
fluorescence in H2O2, but no significant difference
in the presence of DMSO is observed. However, the emission intensity
disappears when dissolved in PBS as well as RPMI 1640 and DMEM cell
culture media, likely due to the insolubility of the complexes. The
emission spectra measured with the cell culture medium and PBS mimic
the intracellular pH conditions. Together, these results indicate
that 3–6 are stable under oxidative and reducing
conditions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a series
of novel BODIPY-based heterometallic palladium
and platinum supramolecules with square architectures were designed
and synthesized in good yields. The formation of the highly charged
cationic complexes was confirmed by various analytical techniques
and their square structures were further examined using the PM7 semi-empirical
method. The anticancer properties of these complexes were studied
using different cancer cell lines. Complexes showed similar toxicities
toward the cancer cells compared to the standard drug, cisplatin in
terms of their IC50 values. However, all complexes were
found to be 7.0 to 15.2 times less toxic than cisplatin in normal
cells (HEK-293), and at the same time, have strong cytotoxicity in
cancer cells. Complex 3 was selective and better in killing
lung cancer cells, whereas 4 and 5 displayed
strong toxicity against HCT116 cells. Complexes 3 and 4 induced apoptosis in HCT116 and PC-3 cells, whereas 5 and 6 followed a necrotic mode of toxicity.
Confocal microscopy studies indicated an extranuclear path of action
for all prepared complexes. A further in-depth examination of the
molecular mechanisms would certainly aid in understanding these drug
candidates.
