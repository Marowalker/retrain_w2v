The
study reported CO2 storage properties of single-walled
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by introducing amino groups onto
CNT surfaces via a chemical process. Two different approaches were
used to produce amino-functionalized nanotubes by adding lithium amide
and l-lysine amino acid. Lithium amide was introduced on
CNT surfaces, and then, it was further modified by adding amino-moiety
(l-lysine amino acid) to obtain multiamino sites on the CNT
surface for CO2 storage. The aminated CNT were followed
by CO2 adsorption experiments, and amino group interactions
with CO2 have helped CNT to achieve higher adsorption capacity.
The successful modification of CNTs showed ameliorated CO2 storage capacity as compared to pristine CNT. The modified CNT possessed
free amine groups on the surface, which led to an enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity. The modified CNT samples were analyzed
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray
diffraction techniques.

Introduction
Carbon dioxide is anticipated as the most
important greenhouse
gas responsible for global warming. It is a major combustion product
in many industries, ranging from energy production in power stations
(fossil fuel and natural gas) to glass and cement fabrication. According
to latest approximation, the level of CO2 surpassed 400
ppm. Fossil fuels supply more than 98% of the world’s energy
needs. However, the combustion of fossil fuels is one of the major
sources of the greenhouse gas CO2. It is necessary to develop
technologies that will allow us to utilize the fossil fuels while
reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Commercial CO2 capture technology that exists currently is very expensive and energy-intensive.
Development of enriched technologies for CO2 capture is
necessary to achieve low energy penalties. The recovery of carbon
dioxide is an important issue, on one side, to decrease the carbon
dioxide emission into the atmosphere and, on the other side, to reuse
the captured carbon dioxide for industrial applications. As a means
to remove CO2 from flue gases on a large-scale, several
different approaches have been proposed.1 In general, there are four main approaches utilized for the separation
of CO2 from other light gases: cryogenic distillation,
membrane purification, absorption with liquids, and adsorption using
solids.1 Cryogenic distillation, although
widely used for other gas separations, is generally not considered
as a practical means to separate CO2 from flue gases because
of the high energy costs involved.

Absorption processes involving
CO2 capture by liquid
media are widely established. The liquid media are often aqueous amine
(e.g., monoethanol amine) solutions or other fluids with basic character,
such as chilled ammonia, that chemically absorb the acid gases.2,3 Commercial processes that are based on physical absorption exist
as well, using methanol or poly-(ethylene glycol) and dimethyl ether
as absorbing phases.4 Absorption-based
processes are often used as the current benchmark for comparing new
CO2 capture processes. Adsorption processes for gas separation
via selective adsorption on solid media are also well-known.5,6 These adsorbents can operate via weak physisorption processes or
strong chemisorptions interactions. Solid adsorbents are typically
employed in cyclic, multimodule processes of adsorption and desorption,
with desorption induced by a pressure or temperature swing. Selective
adsorption on microporous materials seems to provide another alternative.
Accordingly, among the possible procedures, we can mention the adsorption
of CO2 in the amine-based systems, currently used for the
purification of natural gas on the industrial scale. However, amine
plants being complex and costly to develop, the scientific community
has been looking for alternative solutions for both separation/removal
and storage of CO2. Therefore, a transfer from carbon dioxide
absorption in liquid amine baths to adsorption on amine-functionalized
solids may be an interesting way to overcome these mentioned disadvantages.
Leal et al.7 were the first to functionalize
the surface of silica with an aminosilane for its use in the adsorption
of carbon dioxide. The amine-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
were also reported by Ma et al. though for different applications.8 After that, further work was carried out to investigate
the adsorption of carbon dioxide on amine-functionalized materials
using different amine molecules and different techniques.7−14

In this work, we studied the carbon dioxide interaction with
amine-functionalized
materials. We have investigated the use of CNTs functionalized with
amine groups and amine precursors for the use in solid-state CO2 storage. The amine groups were functionalized on the surface
of CNTs via the chemical process using dimethyl formamide (DMF) as
a solvent. The aminated CNTs (ACNTs) were later functionalized with
amino acid precursors such as l-lysine. Recent interests
in CO2 capture with solid sorbents with high CO2 adsorption capacity has led to an active research in this area.7,13,15 Amines immobilized on high surface
area materials can be used as high-capacity CO2 capture
sorbents. We postulate that CO2 adsorption capacity can
be enhanced by increasing the number of amine functional groups on
the surface using diamines (an amine molecule with two amino groups).
Furthermore, this sorbent can be used to capture other acid gases,
such as H2S and SO2. The amine groups are particularly
useful for the adsorption of CO2 bonded chemically or physically
on any supported materials. The ACNTs were investigated for CO2 storage both before and after functionalization with amine
molecules.

Results and Discussions
Figure 1 presents
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of CNT, CNT–LiNH2, and CNT–LiNH2–Lys, indicated as (a–c),
respectively. The curve (a) gives the typical peaks of CNT at around
2θ = 27.0 and 44.0, representing the ordered structure and amorphous
phases of carbon in the sample. Similarly, the profile (b) shows the
peaks from the lithium amide-functionalized CNTs, where the aminated
peaks dominated over the CNTs peaks. These composite peaks provide
information that the amine groups are adsorbed to CNT surfaces in
the form of −NH2. There is a sharp peak at 2θ
= 29.5, which indicated that a part of LiNH2 phase is also
present on the CNT surface. CNT peaks significantly decreased in the
aminated sample and new peaks emerged with good crystallinity as shown
in Figure 1b. In addition,
CNT–NH2–Lys showed various peaks in the spectrum
with high intensity and crystallinity. The peaks belong to the composite
material of CNT–NH2 and lysine chemically mixed
for several hours. The new peaks were emerged because of the functionalized
product of CNTs, which include the formation of N–C bond between
amine groups of CNT–NH2 and that of the carboxyl
group present in lysine as shown in spectrum (c), thus giving rise
to a new composite or grafted product containing two amine groups
in addition to the one attached directly to CNTs. These amine groups
are believed to be effective binding sites for the CO2 storage
under favorable conditions.16−18 Moreover, a negligible amount
of lithium amide is also present in the sample even after washing
several times by using DMF. However, all the samples did not show
any peak which belong to any impurity or byproduct particularly in
ACNTs and functionalized ACNTs. Thus, this development was significant
to conclude that the functionalization of CNT–NH2 to form CNT–NH2–Lys occurred during the
process.19

Figure 1 XRD profiles of CNT and ACNTs: (a) CNT,
(b) CNT–LiNH2, and (c) CNT–LiNH2–Lys.

Figure 2 presents
the surface morphology of samples prepared for this study. The field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs (a–f) indicated
raw CNTs, CNT–NH2, and CNT–NH2–Lys, respectively. The morphologies of pure CNT at two different
magnifications indicated their diameter approximately 50–100
nm and length over 500 nm Figure 2a,b. The addition of LiNH2 to the CNTs however
provided different morphology as shown in (c,d). The nanotubes were
not similar in shape and size compared to that of pure CNT in panel
(b), instead a scattered and long nanotube covered with bonded amine
groups could be observed in the micrographs. It is believed that CNTs
functionalized with amine groups could possibly change their shape
during the process.20 Mostly, the amine
groups are adsorbed on the CNT surface through chemisorptions or physisorption
depending on the experimental conditions. During this interaction
between the CNT and amine group, some traces of lithium ion (Li+) separated from the LiNH2, which paved way for
amine groups to adsorb on the CNT surface. The remaining ions of amine
(NH2–) and lithium (Li+) were
washed out from the sample through DMF repeatedly, and the adsorbed
amine groups were observed from the FESEM image as shown in Figure 2d. Similarly, the
addition of Lys to the ACNTs covers more surface because of the interactions
between amine groups of ACNTs and carboxylic group (−COOH)
of Lys. The amine group of ACNTs involved in chemical bonding with
alpha carbon (−C=O) of −COOH of Lys released
a H2O molecule. The resulted H2O molecule from
the −OH– of −COOH and H+ from the amine group was removed after the sample was heated at
100–110 °C for 2–4 h in a vacuum oven.

Figure 2 FESEM images
of (a,b) CNT, (c,d) CNT–LiNH2, and
(e,f) CNT–LiNH2–Lys.

However, the Lys-functionalized ACNTs presented interesting
results
as shown in Figure 2e,f, where a small fractions of Lys is attached to the ACNTs through
chemical bonding as confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) results presented in the later section. The images also showed
that the ACNTs contain bulk particles of impurities remaining in samples
in the form of LiNH2 and unreacted lysine. However, this
impurity is smaller than that of ACNTs (Figure 2d) as confirmed by XRD results.

Figure 3 presents
the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of CNT, CNT–LiNH2, and CNT–LiNH2–Lys indicated as
(a–c), respectively. The spectrum (a) provided a typical peak
of graphitized C 1s carbon with binding energy 284.5 eV. There was
no other peak present except a small peak (286.1 eV) probably because
of the atmospheric oxidation or residual oxides resulting from the
CNT purification.21 The XPS spectra of
ACNT and ACNT–Lys however showed the peaks of nitrogen (N 1s)
and lithium (Li 1s) elements in addition to the C 1s and O 1s peaks
as observed from the spectra (b,c) of Figure 3. The percentage of lithium was low in spectra
(c) as compared to (b) because of the remaining of small part of LiNH2 as confirmed by XRD analysis. This was also related to the
C 1s peak in trace (c) where a less intense peak is observed as compared
to traces (a,b). The functionalization of Lys on ACNTs probably covers
the most of the CNT surface, which led to the decrease in peak intensity
for C 1s. In addition, this effect was also observed for the O 1s
peaks. This observation clearly shows that the surface of CNT is occupied
by the amine groups (−NH2) in ACNTs and by −NH2 and −Lys in ACNT–Lys samples. Hence led to
low CNTs surface exposed for core-level electrons in XPS measurements.

of samples CNT and ACNTs: (a) CNT, (b) CNT–LiNH2, and (c) CNT–LiNH2–Lys.

Further investigation of the XPS data was carried
out through convolution
of core level electrons of different elements present in the samples.
The details of each element including carbon, oxygen and nitrogen,
lithium and their core level states are presented in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. Figure 4 shows the C 1s and O 1s core level electrons of the three samples,
where (a,b), (c,d), and (e,f) indicates the raw CNT (a,b), CNT–LiNH2 (b,c), and CNT–LiNH2–Lys (e,f),
respectively. The CNT shows three peaks of C 1s orbital with a typical
peak from graphitized carbon in C=C with binding energy 284.5
eV indicated as C1 in Figure 4a. Similarly, the peaks C2 and C3 were identified to arise
from C–O and C–C, respectively.22 Similarly, there were four types of carbon and three types of O1
peaks convoluted from the ACNT sample. The ACNT showed different carbon
peaks (C1, C2, C3, and C4 in Figure 4b) which could be assigned to C=C, C–O,
C–C, and C–N functionalities, respectively. Amino acid-functionalized
ACNT (ACNT–Lys) provided three carbon peaks assigned as C1,
C2, and C3 in Figure 4A(c). The C2 peak confirmed the presence of C=O, which is
from the lysine molecule added to ACNT for the functionalization.
Because there were not many carbon peaks in ACNT–Lys, there
was no impurity present in the form of inorganic or organic materials
other than lithium and l-lysine. However, the presence of
H2O and LiOH were observed as indicated in Figure 4A(f). This confirmed that the
surface of CNT was occupied by both amine groups and by l-lysine through chemical bonding, corresponding to the different
functionalities of different carbons as well as oxygen. In addition
to this, a detailed XPS core electron analysis of nitrogen and lithium
was investigated to find out their exact contribution toward the surface
modifications of the samples.

Figure 5 Schematic representation of the reactions involved in the study.

In this investigation of elements
of nitrogen and lithium from
the ACNT and ACNT–Lys, we observed peaks of Li 1s and N 1s
as in Figure 4B. It
was analyzed that the peaks of lithium comes from Li–O, Li–N,
and Li–C assigned as Li1, Li2, and Li3 in Figure 4B(a), respectively. However,
the functionalized ACNT showed only two XPS peaks (Li1 and Li2) probably
belonged to Li–O and Li–N, which indicated that there
was little or negligible amount of LiNH2 present after
the functionalization of the ACNT with lysine. This also confirmed
that the −NH2 group on the CNT surface has contributed
to the covalent bonding with the −COOH group of l-lysine,
resulting in the loss of H2O and formation of the C–N
bond between −COOH and −NH2 groups. This
development provided two −NH2 groups present in
the lysine molecule to the ACNT for CO2 storage through
chemical bonding between −NH2 and CO2. Finally, the XPS study showed that the modifications carried out
on the CNT surface were successfully achieved for higher CO2 adsorption.23 The important development
however was the grafting of the −NH2 group of ACNT
with that of the −COOH group of lysine, which was clearly observed
from the Figure 4A(c),
where only three peaks of carbon were obtained.

Figure 5 provides
the schematic representation of the prepared samples for this study.
The simple mechanistic routes suggested that the CNT acted as a support
for the amine precursors for CO2 absorption. The other
functionalized supports previously used for the CO2 adsorption
were silica or titania.24 This functionalization
of −NH2 on CNTs usually takes place through chemical
bonding or sometimes as a physisorption in nature25 and thus gives rise to C–N bonding as confirmed
by XPS results. Furthermore, the ACNTs were treated with an organic
compound lysine, which includes one −COOH group and two −NH2 groups in a single molecule. The −NH2 group
of the ACNT is free to bond with the −COOH group of lysine,
thus releasing a H2O molecule. After the functionalization
on the ACNT, two amine groups were available for two or more CO2 molecules to adsorb as shown in the Figure 5. The substitution of water actually occurs
when an electron rich amine group interacts with the carbonyl of the
carboxyl group present in lysine. This interaction leads to form a
new bonding between carbon and nitrogen, thus giving a grafted product
with multiamine groups attached on the CNT support. This would help
to enhance the adsorption of CO2 on CNTs or ACNTs under
modified conditions.26

In order to
know the chemical nature of the modified samples, FTIR
measurements were carried out for CNTs and functionalized CNTs assigned
as CNT, CNT–NH2, and CNT–NH2–Lys
in Figure 6, respectively.
The IR spectrum of raw CNT showed a typical peak at around 1600–1650
cm–1, which belongs to the C=C of ordered
phase. There was a weak and broad band present at wavenumber approximately
3400 cm–1, which was attributed to O–H groups
on the surface of CNT.21 Similarly, the
IR spectrum of CNT–NH2 showed the band at 1250 cm–1 assigned to that of C–N bond stretching as
shown in Figure 6.
Furthermore, weak and broad bands between wavenumbers 2950–3100
cm–1 were attributed to N–H stretching bands.
In addition, a weak band that appeared at 3700 cm–1 corresponds to the O–H stretching bands. This O–H
band was emerged because of absorption of moisture or OH by the lithium
ion (Li+), thus forming LiOH during the process. In addition,
an IR of CNT–NH2–Lys has shown number of
bands for different functionalities present within the material. A
band at 1610 cm–1 is attributed to the −C=O
group,27 which is at lower frequency because
of the bonding with the amine group of ACNT, thus reducing its band
toward lower wavenumbers. However, the actual frequency of C=O
in the −COOH group is approximately 1700–1785 cm–1. This result is in consistent with the XPS findings
explained above. Small bands of C–N and N–H at 1230
and 1570 cm–1 were observed related to the formation
of new amide in ACNT–NH2–Lys. Furthermore,
weak stretching bands at wavenumbers 2800–3000 cm–1 were assigned to that of N–H and C–H functionalities,
respectively. These IR results were consistent with the XPS results
explained in the above section, thus confirming the functionalization
of ACNT–NH2 and ACNT–NH2–Lys.

ACNT.

The N2 isotherms of samples at
273 K were obtained and shown in
the Figure 7. The CNT,
CNT–NH2, and CNT–NH2–Lys
showed different curves from type II for CNT and type IV for CNT–NH2–Lys, respectively. The samples of modified CNT did
not show any micropores and there was no N2 adsorption
at lower pressures. The nitrogen adsorption increased at higher relative
pressures (P/P0 0.7–0.9)
up to 350 and 175 cm3/g for CNT–NH2 and
CNT–NH2–Lys, respectively. The N2 adsorption for CNT was approximately 170 cm3/g under
similar conditions. The reduction in N2 adsorption in CNT–NH2–Lys as compared to CNT–NH2 was due
to the large CNT surface occupied by Lys molecules through chemical
interaction with amine groups present on the CNT surfaces. The addition
of lysine precursors as led to the blocking of pores thus reduced
the overall pore volume, which reduced the N2 adsorption
onto the CNT–NH2–Lys. However, the surface
of CNT–NH2 was not covered fully by the amine precursor
used, but there was less effect on the porosity of CNTs. Another reason
for high N2 adsorption could be the lithium ions (Li+) present on the surface of CNT–NH2, which
came from the amine precursor LiNH2 used for the amination
of CNTs. The Li+ being electron-deficient can easily attract
the electron-rich nitrogen to form a complex. Subsequently, this adsorption
by Li+ could lead to further increase in the adsorption
of nitrogen onto the CNT–NH2. Interestingly, this
phenomenon was not found in the CNT–NH2–Lys
sample, where there was negligible amount of Li+ present
on the surface because of the extra washing and lysine functionalization
of the CNT–NH2 sample. Thus, the lysine functionalization
reduced the surface area of CNT–NH2–Lys,
which proved to be insignificant for the N2 adsorption.
However, the CNT–NH2–Lys was still better
than CNT in N2 adsorption by a small factor of approx.
5 cm3/g. This showed that the N2 adsorption
in CNT–NH2–Lys was probably through different
factors. First, the N2 adsorption might be due to the spaces
originated from the functionalization of lysine on the CNT–NH2. These channels between two fictionalized groups can adsorb
nitrogen chemically and/or physically on the surface of CNT–NH2–Lys. The second reason for the adsorption of N2 might be the presence of a small amount of Li+ onto the surface as confirmed from XPS results. Thus, these results
showed that the nitrogen adsorption of CNT was effective by amine
and lysine functionalization, which produced higher adsorption capacity
as compared to raw CNT.

CNT samples.

Carbon dioxide adsorption
experiments were performed at 273 K and
a pressure of 750 mmHg. The results are presented in Figure 8, where each sample
was analyzed under similar conditions for CO2 storage.
The unmodified CNT adsorbed 150 cm3 of CO2 at
a given pressure. The adsorption of CO2 in CNT was the
result of the high porosity and surface area of CNT. The CO2 adsorption of CNT showed its active nature toward the free CO2 molecule. However, the percentage of CO2 was increased
after the medication of CNT with amine precursors. The ACNT–NH2 sample further enhanced the CO2 storage to 178
cm3 at similar pressure as that of the CNT sample. The
increase in CO2 storage was related to the −NH2 groups, which are very active for CO2 adsorption
because of the free electrons present on the nitrogen atom. Subsequently,
the −NH2 groups interact with CO2 under
pressure and gave rise to the formation of some intermediates such
as carbamate or carbamic acid species as reported in the literature.24 Some CO2 was also adsorbed on the
vacant space of the CNT surface, thus helping to maintain the pure
CNT storage capacity. Thus, additional modified ACNT–NH2 with lysine provided a much higher CO2 quantity
than unmodified and ACNT–NH2 samples. The total
capacity of CO2 adsorbed by ACNT–NH2–Lys
was estimated to be 230 cm3 with similar conditions. This
ameliorated capacity was significant toward the CO2 storage.
It showed that the amine groups had played a greater role in the enhanced
CO2 storage as reported previously by many studies.28

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the CNTs and
modified CNTs for
the use in CO2 adsorption. The CNTs were modified by using
amino group-containing precursors via a chemical process. The functionalization
of CNT with amino precursors has significantly improved the CO2 storage capacity of CNTs. First, the CNT was treated with
LiNH2 under appropriate conditions to get the ACNT or the
amine-functionalized CNT. The part of this prepared ACNT was further
modified with organic amine precursor, l-lysine. The CNT
and ACNT interactions with LiNH2 and l-lysine
were confirmed through XPS and FTIR measurements, respectively, and
related these results with previously reported amino–carboxylic
interactions. The unmodified CNT and modified CNT showed a significant
CO2 adsorption at STP. The CO2 adsorption capacity
of CNT was observed to be approximately 150 cm3/g, and
this adsorption capacity was further increased significantly after
the CNT was modified with amide and lysine precursors. The ACNT and
ACNT–Lys produced higher CO2 storage (178 cm3/g) and (250 cm3/g) under similar conditions, respectively.
These results provide an opportunity to extend these adsorptive application
areas of high standard CNTs in large quantity.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
The single-walled CNT, lithium
amide (LiNH2), l-lysine, and DMF were procured
from Aldrich and were used without any further purification. The first
step in the process was the preparation of the ACNT or the amine-functionalized
CNT in DMF for 12 h. The prepared solution of LiNH2/DMF
(1 g/10 g) was added to the CNT/DMF (1 g/20 g) solution at 50 °C
and was stirred constantly for 8–12 h until the homogeneous
solution was obtained. The solution was then filtered and washed several
times with DMF to remove unreacted amide molecules. The sample was
dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 6 h. After drying, the sample
of ACNT was taken for the further characterization and analysis.

Functionalization of the ACNT
The remaining ACNT was
further dissolved in DMF and constantly stirred for 1 h. A predissolved l-lysine (Lys) was added to ACNT solution once and was kept
under vigorous stirring for further 8 h. The solution was filtered
and washed several times to remove impurities and unreacted materials
in the reaction mixture. The product was dried in a vacuum oven at
100 °C for 6 h and finally followed by detailed characterization
and analysis. The prepared samples were collected in air-tight sample
vials to protect them from the oxidation or atmospheric moisture.
The use of lysine for functionalization was performed because of the
presence of additional number of amine groups in it, particularly
significant for CO2 interactions. Lysine also contains
one carboxylic group (−COOH), which is involved in the reaction
with the amine group of ACNT to form the nitrogen–carbon bond
(N–C) as the functional group from carboxylic to amide formation.

Characterization
The surface morphology of the prepared
samples was investigated using FESEM (Hitachi, S-5500). The samples
were examined without any of the coatings usually used in FESEM measurements.
XRD measurements were performed using a D/Max-2200 Ultima/PC apparatus
(Rigaku, Japan) to analyze the elemental phases and the crystalline
structures in the materials. XPS spectra of the samples were obtained
using a MultiLab 2000 spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, UK)
to investigate the chemical nature and oxidation states of the samples.
FTIR of samples was conducted to identify the chemical nature of each
precursor after grafting. To study the CO2 adsorption of
the samples, the BET analyzer Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument was
used. The measurements were performed at 273 K.
