We
have developed a substantially faster and greener technique
for routine chemical reaction workups. We use silicone elastomer-coated
glass powder (“FastWoRX”) as an absorbent to extract
organic products from a quenched aqueous reaction mixture. After filtration,
FastWoRX powder loaded with organic products can serve as a convenient
input for flash chromatographic separations. With this technique,
tedious and solvent-consuming liquid–liquid extractions are
replaced by a simple filtration. Use of FastWoRX reduces solvent use
and the E-factor by up to an order of magnitude compared
to traditional liquid–liquid extraction-based workup.

Introduction
Organic synthesis is
of fundamental importance in the discovery
of new pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. For
example, during the discovery phase to develop a drug, the synthesis
of a large number of compounds is needed for biological evaluation
and optimization. However, the labor-intensive nature of organic synthesis
and its hazardous conditions have not changed fundamentally despite
other significant advances. Typically, after reaction completion,
a workup or cleanup procedure is needed to quench the active intermediate
(e.g., acid chloride) and catalyst(s) and remove water-soluble inorganic
byproducts (e.g., salts) and polar solvents, which can affect chromatographic
separation. Reaction workup is a particularly time- and labor-consuming
practice.1

The most common reaction
workup procedure is liquid–liquid
extraction (LLE) using a separatory funnel. A typical LLE-based procedure
has the following steps: the crude reaction mixture is quenched with
a suitable aqueous solution (e.g., saturated NH4Cl solution)
to stop the reaction and destroy excess reagent(s)/intermediate(s)/catalyst(s)
and to dissolve water-soluble byproducts. Then, the mixture is extracted
with organic solvents (e.g., diethyl ether or ethyl acetate) in an
iterative fashion and the combined organic layers are washed with
an aqueous solution to remove inorganic byproducts. Next, the organic
phase is dried using a drying agent such as Na2SO4. The drying agent is then filtered and the solvents in the filtrate
are removed under vacuum. Finally, the organic residue is further
purified by flash chromatography. All of these steps are indeed labor-
and time-consuming, especially for the workup of a large number of
reactions. Additional disadvantages of LLE include the use of relatively
large volumes of solvent, possible emulsion formation that blurs the
separation between liquid phases, and a relatively high chance of
contact with potentially hazardous chemicals and solvents.

To
overcome these drawbacks, we originally developed a substantially
faster technique for workup that relied on a porous organic polymer
(“Porelite”)-supported solvent phase (a “rigid
solvent”) to extract organic products from an aqueous reaction
mixture.2 Porelite was based on a then-new
type of porous polymer—a high internal phase emulsion polymer
(“polyHIPE”) containing extremely large and interconnected
pores.3−10 However, large-scale preparation of a polyHIPE-type polymer such
as Porelite was later found to be difficult. A large amount of a templating
surfactant was used in the preparation of Porelite and the complete
removal of the surfactant was not easy. Also, the density of polystyrene
foam-like Porelite is very low (ca. 0.15 g/mL),2 which was later found to cause handling and weighing problems,
particularly in low ambient humidity conditions that promote static
electric charge generation.

Results and Discussion
It is highly
desired to develop a fast reaction workup protocol
using an easy-to-handle absorbent which can be prepared using a scalable
protocol. Instead of using a porous organic polymer, our next-generation
extraction absorbent is based on the encapsulation of an inert inorganic
support with a permeable organic elastomer (Figure 1a). The support is inert to most organic
compounds. It will typically be an inorganic such as glass powder
or beads of suitable size but could be organic if suitable for the
application. The inorganic support we chose is glass powder, which
is generally chemically inert and readily available at commercial
scale. We chose a commercially available and inexpensive silicone
elastomer (silicone rubber) precursor 1(11) for coating the glass powder (Figure 1a). Precursor 1 has the poly(dimethylsiloxane)
backbone with reactive acetoxy sites for cross-linking. Precursor 1 reacts with the surface hydroxy groups on the glass powder
and cross-links by reacting with the moisture in the air, releasing
the byproduct acetic acid. As a result, the glass powder is coated
with a thin layer of silicone elastomer. Of course, other siloxane
compounds, including fluorinated ones, could also be used depending
on the application. Silicone elastomers are generally hydrophobic,
inert, and highly permeable12 and their
high permeability has been applied in membranes for blood oxygenation,
gas separation, drug delivery,12 catalyst
immobilization,13−22 and solid-phase microextraction.23,24 The high flexibility
of the silicon–oxygen chain in silicone elastomers provides
“openings” and “free volume” that permit
the incorporation and diffusion of organic products and solvents12,25 (Figure 1a). After
coating a thin layer of silicone elastomer on glass powder, the sorbent
(we named it FastWoRX, now commercially available from Faster Chemistry
LLC) can be used for the next-generation reaction workup (Figure 1b). The concept is
simple: the organic product/solvent mixture will have an affinity
for the organic silicone polymer layer because of the high permeability
and high internal “free volume” of silicone.

process; (b) concept of FastWoRX-based extraction;
and (c) workflow of FastWoRX-based reaction workup.

It should be noted that FastWoRX is different than
solid-phase
extraction (SPE),26−28 widely used in analytical work, although they both
utilize a solid to do an extraction. SPE is based on adsorption—the surface of the support is treated with a compound to
give the surface an affinity for a certain class of target compounds
present in the aqueous phase. However, using only the surface limits
the SPE resin’s capacity to hold organics. The SPE resin best
suited for a given target compound is found on a case-by-case basis.
In contrast, FastWoRX is based on the broad absorption of organics—the powder absorbs most organics into the bulk
volume of its relatively thick polymer coating, removing the capacity
limit imposed by surface area. The nonspecific affinity of the hydrophobic
polymer coating for organic compounds allows compounds to be absorbed
into the polymer while excluding water. This forms a “solid
solvent” phase in which the absorbed organics are immobile
compared to the usual liquid solvent.12,25 Therefore,
our process is similar to traditional LLE but without one of the liquids.
SPE is good for analytical work but due to the high price of the resins
and their relatively low capacity, it is impractical for preparative
applications such as reaction workup. On the other hand, FastWoRX
is relatively inexpensive, organic nonspecific, and has high organic-holding
capacity, making it very suitable for preparative applications. Therefore,
FastWoRX can practically separate mixtures at a scale ranging from
milligrams to kilograms.

The typical workflow of a FastWoRX-based
reaction workup is straightforward
(Figure 1c). The reaction
is conducted in the usual way and quenched with a suitable aqueous
solution. Instead of using a relatively large amount of a conventional
organic solvent such as ethyl acetate to extract the aqueous reaction
mixture, we added FastWoRX powder to the mixture. Then, after evaporating
most of the solvent and a simple filtration of the FastWoRX powder
from the aqueous mixture, the desired organic products are incorporated
in the FastWoRX powder. The desired products can be eluted from the
FastWoRX powder by a suitable organic solvent during chromatography.
By doing this, tedious and solvent-consuming LLE(s) is avoided. In
addition, a common problem with LLE—emulsion formation—is
eliminated because there is no need for the separation of two liquid
phases. Also, automation and parallelization of FastWoRX-based workups
is much easier than automating traditional LLE. Compared to traditional
LLE-based workup, our FastWoRX-based workup saves a lot of time and
solvent and greatly reduces the chance of contact with potentially
hazardous chemicals.

The ideal reaction workup protocol should
have a high recovery
rate (recovery of organic products from a quenched aqueous mixture).
The recovery rate for FastWoRX-based workup will depend on two factors:
(1) the complete transfer of the sorbent from the reaction flask to
the filtration device and (2) the water solubility of the target products.
In our model system (Table 1), a test compound (p-toluenesulfonamide)
was dissolved in an organic solvent (ethyl acetate) and pure water
or a saturated solution of NaCl was added under stirring to simulate
the quenching of a chemical reaction. We investigated the effect of
the particle size of the glass powder and the amount of silicone coating
on the recovery rate. We found that noncoated glass powder is not
effective (Table 1,
entry 1), the optimum particle size is about 180 mesh, and the optimum
amount of coating is about 5 wt/wt % of the support weight (Table 1, entry 8). When the
particles are too small (e.g., 400 mesh), the particles tend to stick
to the glass wall of the reaction flask, making complete transfer
to a filtration device more difficult (Table 1, entry 9). Because p-toluenesulfonamide
has moderate water solubility (0.32 g/100 mL water), the recovery
rate from pure water is only 88%. The recovery can be greatly improved
(to 97%) by using brine instead of water (Table 1, entry 8).

a Procedure:
the test compound, p-toluenesulfonamide (100 mg),
was dissolved in 5 mL of
ethyl acetate, then 5 mL of water or 5 mL of saturated NaCl solution
was added with stirring (this is a simulation of a reaction mixture
after quenching), and then 1.0 g of the sorbent was added. After stirring
for 2 min, most of the ethyl acetate was removed with vacuum and the
mixture was filtered and washed with water or brine (ca. 5 mL) and
finally washed with ethyl acetate to recover the product.

With our optimized parameters, the
FastWoRX particles loaded with
organic products are relatively nonsticky toward the glass walls of
the reaction vessel and the transfer of the sorbent from the reaction
flask to the filtration device is relatively complete by rinsing with
a small amount of water or brine. Therefore, the recovery rate is
mostly determined by the water solubility of the target products.
We studied the recovery rate of diverse organic products with various
water solubilities (Table 2). Our protocol is widely applicable and gave excellent recoveries
for most test compounds investigated (including hydrocarbon, alcohol,
heterocycle, acid, and ester functionalities) (Table 2). The only exception was the extraction
of glucose and an amino acid, but this result was not surprising as
these compounds are only soluble in water and are not soluble in most
organic solvents.

a Procedure: the test compound (100
mg) was dissolved in 5 mL of ethyl acetate, then 5 mL of water or
5 mL of saturated NaCl solution was added with stirring (this is a
simulation of a reaction mixture after quenching), and then 1.0 g
of the sorbent was added. After stirring for 2 min, most of the ethyl
acetate was removed with vacuum and the mixture was filtered and washed
with water or brine (ca. 5 mL) and finally washed with ethyl acetate
(ca. 20 mL) to recover the product.

After filtration, FastWoRX powder loaded with organic
products
can serve as a convenient input for flash chromatographic separations.
The quality of the separation achieved with our new workup method
(e.g., peak width) is similar to the conventional method of dry loading
on silica gel (Figure 2) with a test mixture of 1:1:1 of ferrocene, p-Cl-benzaldehyde,
and p-NO2-benzaldehyde.

The test mixture is a 1:1:1 mixture of ferrocene, p-Cl-benzaldehyde, and p-NO2-benzaldehyde.
The blue line represents the percentage of ethyl acetate (B) in the
eluent (ethyl acetate/hexanes); the red/yellow/purple lines are the
UV absorption curves at wavelengths of 254, 220, and 280 nm, respectively.

Our new workup also worked very
well in diverse synthetic reactions
(Figure 3). Compared
to the traditional LLE-based reaction workup, our procedure gave comparable
or slightly better isolated yields (after chromatographic purifications)
with an order of magnitude less solvent use. All reactions in Figure 3 used a standard
volume of 5 mL of ethyl acetate for the FastWoRX method (see “General Procedure for FastWoRX-Based Reaction Workup” in the Experimental Section). However,
about half of these example reactions were done in a water-immiscible
solvent and could have been worked up with FastWoRX without the addition
of any solvent to extract products from a water miscible solvent (or,
in some cases, to dissolve solid products).

Figure 3 Comparison study of LLE-based
and FastWoRX-based reaction workups.
(a) For the LLE-based workups, the time required for drying the reaction
mixture after LLE using a drying agent such as Na2SO4 is not included. This normally requires from 0.5 h to few
hours so the actual LLE-based workup times will be much longer. (b) E-factor is calculated for the workup process only. E-factor = waste generated (grams)/product (grams). For
LLE based work-up, the lower E-Factor is calculated
using 20 mL EtOAc and the upper E-Factor is calculated
using 50 mL EtOAc for extraction and washing. For FastWoRX work-up,
the lower E-Factor is calculated with no added solvent if using a
water-immiscible reaction solvent and the upper E-Factor is calculated with 5 mL of EtOAc added. Using the work-up
of 3 as an example: LLE E-Factor = (6
g (NH4Cl solution for quenching) + 18.0 or 45.1 g (20 or
50 mL EtOAc for extraction and washing))/0.090 g (product) = 267 -
568; FastWoRX E-Factor = (1.2 g (NH4Cl
solution) + 4.51 g (5 mL EtOAc))/0.0913 g (product) = 63. This reaction
uses a water-miscible solvent so EtOAc must be added.

In addition, importantly, our workup protocol only
needed a simple
filtration for each sample, which could be done in parallel using
a commercially available filtration station.

In general, the
FastWoRX-based reaction workup has many benefits
over LLE-based workup including:(1) Solvent savings—For a typical
reaction conducted at 100 mg scale and depending on the chemist's
preferences, 20 to 50 mL or more of solvent is typically needed for
traditional LLE-based work-up. FastWoRX-based reaction work-up can
be done with only 0−5 mL of solvent (depending on the reaction
solvent—if the reaction solvent is not water-miscible, no extra
solvent need be added)—a significant reduction (see E-Factors in Figure 3).

(2) Time savings—traditional
LLE-based
reaction workup requires many steps such as LLE (10+ min per extraction,
longer if there is emulsion formation), drying of the organic layers
with Na2SO4 and filtration of Na2SO4 (20+ min), removing excess solvents with a rotavap
(10 min), and loading the residue to a loading cartridge (10 min).
Therefore, typically, the total time will be more than 50 min (Figure 3). Our FastWoRX-based
method only requires the solvent removal and filtration steps so the
total time will typically be 15 min or less. Also, our filtration-based
method can be set up in parallel using a commercially available filtration
station. Therefore, much greater time savings can be realized if doing
multiple reactions in parallel. It should be noted that for the LLE-based
workups, the time required for drying of the reaction mixture after
LLE using a drying agent such as Na2SO4 is not
included. This normally requires from 0.5 h to a few hours so the
actual LLE-based workup times will be much longer. Also, the time
for washing glassware (e.g., separatory funnels) and other ancillary
tasks is not included in our estimates.

(3) Reduction in potential human contact
with hazardous reagents and solvents.



Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a substantially faster, more efficient,
and greener technique for workup after chemical reactions. FastWoRX
is commercially available now (fasterchemistry.com). Other
applications of this new technique are currently being pursued in
our laboratory.

Experimental Section
General
1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (101 MHz) spectra were recorded
on a Bruker NMR apparatus.
The chemical shifts are reported in δ (ppm) values (1H and 13C NMR relative to CHCl3, δ 7.26
ppm for 1H NMR, and δ 77.0 ppm for 13C
NMR) or alternatively, 1H NMR chemical shifts were referenced
to tetramethylsilane signal (0 ppm). Multiplicities are recorded by
s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), p (pentet), h
(hextet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). Coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz). Gas chromatography (GC) analyses
were performed using a Shimadzu GC-2010 GC–mass spectrometry
instrument equipped with a Shimadzu AOC-20s autosampler. CombiFlash
Rf 200 (Teledyne ISCO) was used for chromatographic separation. Silicone
elastomer precursor 1 (structure shown in Figure 1) was purchased from Dow Corning.
Glass powder (180 mesh) was purchased from Hangzhou High-Tech Composite
Material Company. Other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Strem,
Acros, and Adamas.

Preparation of the Silicone-Coated Absorbent
(FastWoRX)
Ten grams of silicone rubber precursor 1 was dissolved
in 150 mL
of ethyl acetate in a 500 mL round-bottle flask under stirring; then,
190 g of glass powder (180 mesh) was added. The mixture was stirred
for 10 min and then excess ethyl acetate was removed using a rotavap
under vacuum. The obtained powder was placed on a tray and kept in
open air for 48 h to cure (caution—the curing process generates
acetic acid). The obtained powder (ca. 200 g) was washed with ethyl
acetate (ca. 250 mL) and dried in vacuum.

General Procedure for LLE-Based
Reaction Workup
After
the reaction was quenched with a suitable aqueous solution, such as
saturated ammonium chloride solution (5 mL), the reaction mixture
was extracted with EtOAc (10 mL × 2); the combined organic phases
were dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and Na2SO4 cake was washed with EtOAc (30 mL); the solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by
an automatic flash chromatography system.
