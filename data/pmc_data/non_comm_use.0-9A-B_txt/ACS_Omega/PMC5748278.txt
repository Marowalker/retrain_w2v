A novel crosslinker [4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl
diacrylate (44BDA)]
was developed, and a series of temperature-responsive hydrogels were
synthesized through free radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) with 44BDA. The temperature-responsive
behavior of the resulting gels was characterized by swelling studies,
and the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the hydrogels
was characterized through differential scanning calorimetry. Increased
content of 44BDA led to a decreased swelling ratio and shifted the
LCST to lower temperatures. These novel hydrogels also displayed resiliency
through multiple swelling–deswelling cycles, and their temperature
responsiveness was reversible. The successful synthesis of NIPAAm-based
hydrogels crosslinked with 44BDA has led to a new class of temperature-responsive
hydrogel systems with a variety of potential applications.

1 Introduction
Hydrogels
are crosslinked three-dimensional polymeric networks
that swell in aqueous solution but do not dissolve.1,2 Stimuli-responsive
hydrogels exhibit swelling behavior that changes in response to environmental
factors such as pH, salt concentration, temperature, etc.3−6 These “smart” hydrogels have attracted much attention
due to their variety of applications in biomedicine,1,7 drug delivery,2,8,9 tissue
engineering,10,11 separation processes,12 wastewater treatment,13−15 etc.

Temperature-responsive hydrogels, especially the ones based on N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm), are particularly appealing
because of their unique properties. NIPAAm-based polymers typically
exhibit a well-defined lower critical solution temperature (LCST)
at 32 °C in aqueous solution, at which hydrogen bonds form/break
between water molecules and the NIPAAm chain, followed by hydration/dehydration
of the network.8,11,16 The fine balance between hydrophobic–hydrophilic nature causes
the swelling behavior of NIPAAm hydrogels to change significantly
over a narrow temperature range.17 This
temperature-modulated swelling property has been applied to develop
an on–off switch for various activities such as drug delivery,
controlled release, etc.14,18,19 In addition, the LCST can be modified through incorporating a hydrophobic
or hydrophilic comonomer/crosslinker to adjust the hydrophilic–hydrophobic
balance within the polymer. Usually, biomedical applications require
the LCST to be between ambient temperature and body temperature (∼37
°C) or even above body temperature. The incorporation of hydrophilic
compounds such as methacrylic acid,20,21N-hydroxyethylacrylamide,2,22 and acrylic acid3,18,23 has been demonstrated to raise
the LCST. In regard to such studies, Lue et al. showed that addition
of 2.7 mol % hydrophilic acrylic acid to poly-NIPAAm-based gels increased
the LCST from 34.82 to 43.96 °C.3 For
other research, such as separation processes, it is potentially desirable
to lower the LCST closer to ambient temperatures, so that large energy
input is not needed to drive the transition. The incorporation of
hydrophobic comonomers has been reported by several studies, for example,
di-n-propylacrylamide,24 methyl methacrylate,25 and butylmethacrylate
(BMA).26 Bae et al. reported a shift of
LCST to ∼17 °C after the addition of 10 mol % of BMA.26

We synthesized NIPPAm-based thermoresponsive
hydrogels using a
novel crosslinker, 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl diacrylate (44BDA).
44BDA is synthesized from 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl, which is
an aromatic hydrocarbon derivative.27,28 4,4′-Dihydroxybiphenyl
is known to work as a mesogen in combination with aliphatic dibasic
acids to synthesize thermotropic liquid crystal polyesters, which
have been reported to exhibit a unique odd–even effect.29−31 Beyond that, Chung et al. reported several studies using 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl
as a tyrosinase inhibitor for skin whitening purposes in the field
of cosmetics.32,33 This present work focuses specifically
on the synthesis and characterization of 44BDA and NIPAAm-based temperature-responsive
hydrogels that use 44BDA as a crosslinker. In this paper, we have
studied the effects of 44BDA content on the swelling behavior and
LCST of NIPAAm hydrogels. The goal of incorporating 44BDA was to decrease
the LCST while maintaining the temperature-responsive behaviors of
NIPAAm gels and to introduce the unique biphenyl functionality to
the network, which could potentially be useful for environmental remediation.
This is the first report of the synthesis of 44BDA, as well as 44BDA-crosslinked
NIPAAm hydrogels.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Analysis of 44BDA by Liquid Chromatography
Time-of-Flight (LC–TOF) Mass Spectrometry
Upon reaction
of 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl (precursor) with acryloyl chloride,
hydroxyl groups were replaced by acrylate groups, and depending on
the number of hydroxyl groups that were replaced, two forms of acrylated
product could be produced: 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl monoacrylate
and 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl diacrylate. To determine the average
molecular weight of the resulting product, LC–TOF was used
to identify different forms of the acrylate and their corresponding
percentages, with the results shown in Figure 1. Determining the average molecular weight
is critical because it is used in the following calculations for gel
synthesis. The major peak present at 12.9 min with a molecular weight
of 295 g/mol corresponds to 44BDA, and the peak intensity was reported
as 4.97 × 107 cps. According to a previous 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl
partial acrylation study, the 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl monoacrylate
and precursor had peaks at around 9 and 6 min, respectively (see Supporting Information). Referencing the partial
acrylation results, the minimal peak at 9.08 min shown in Figure 1a,b corresponds to
4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl monoacrylate. There was no measurable
peak around 6 min in Figure 1a–c corresponding to the precursor, which is likely
due to the addition of an excess amount of acryloyl chloride (3:1,
and 1 mole of 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl only reacts with 2 moles
of acryloyl chloride (AC)). The excess addition of acryloyl chloride
resulted in approximately 100% conversion of the precursor to the
diacrylate product, leaving 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl (with a
molecular weight of 187 g/mol) and 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl monoacrylate
(with a molecular weight of 241 g/mol) with no measurable contribution.
Two minor peaks present at 10.26 and 17.11 min might be associated
with impurities left in 44BDA, which could either be side products
from acrylation or impurities in the precursor. Because of the approximate
100% conversion of 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl to 44BDA, the average
molecular weight of 44BDA was considered to be 295 g/mol.

(b) monoacrylate, and (c) diacrylate.

2.2 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
A combined HPLC chromatogram for 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl
and 44BDA is shown in Figure 2. The blue and green lines represent the chromatograms for
4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl and 44BDA, respectively. The major peak
observed in the blue line shown at 4.5 min is associated with the
characteristic peak of 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl. No peak was
observed at 4.5 min in the case of 44BDA (green line), indicating
all starting material was converted to the acrylated forms. On the
basis of an increase in hydrophobicity of the acrylated forms of 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl,
the major peak in 44BDA shown at 11 min can be attributed to either
the mono- or diacrylate of 44BDA. Because of the excess acryloyl chloride
addition during synthesis, the reaction was pushed further to produce
almost 100% diacrylate. Thus, on the basis of our analysis, the peak
could be assigned to 44BDA instead of 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl
monoacrylate, and these results were observed to be in accordance
with the LC–TOF data discussed in the previous section.

2.3 Synthesis of NIPAAm Gels Crosslinked with
44BDA
Five different 44BDA-crosslinked NIPAAm gels and a
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) comparison group were prepared via free
radical polymerization. The acrylate groups on 44BDA allow for the
crosslinking with the NIPAAm chain resulting in the network structure.
Prior to gel synthesis, reaction conditions (temperature, time, N2 purging) were optimized.

2.4 Swelling
Studies
The kinetic swelling
behavior of 44BDA gels was studied at 25 °C. A plot of swelling
ratio versus time (Figure 3) shows that the gels reach equilibrium swelling by 24 h.
For all swelling studies reported in this work, NIPAAm crosslinked
with 0.9 mol % of PEG400DMA was chosen as a comparison group for the
44BDA gels, and it was labeled as PEG 0.9 control. PEG multiacrylates
and multimethacrylates are commonly used crosslinkers, and they have
been reported in several studies.34−36 From Figure 3, it can be observed that the
equilibrium swelling ratio decreased significantly with increasing
44BDA content, as expected. The PEG400DMA comparison group had the
highest swelling ratio, because PEG400DMA is less hydrophobic than
44BDA.

Figure 3 Kinetic swelling study of PEG control gel and 44BDA gel set, error
bars represent average swelling ratio ± standard deviation where n = 3.

The temperature-dependent
swelling profiles of the NIPAAm-based
hydrogels with varying amounts of 44BDA are illustrated in Figure 4. As temperature
increased, swelling decreased until 50 °C, when all gels completely
collapsed. The swelling ratio decreased significantly between 25 and
35 °C, where the phase transitions were observed. The transition
temperatures shifted away from the LCST of NIPAAm (32–33 °C),
which was expected, as addition of a hydrophobic crosslinker should
shift the transition temperature to lower temperatures. Higher 44BDA-content
gels showed broader phase transitions than those of the lower content
ones, which was due to their higher crosslinking degrees in the gel
structure. This can especially be seen in the 44BDA 3.6 and 4.5 gels,
which require a temperature of 50 °C to collapse completely,
whereas the lower-crosslinked ones collapsed completely at 35 °C.
Comparable investigations by Inomata et al. and Tang et al.37,38 also confirmed that the transition range is influenced by crosslinking
density.

44BDA gel set, error bars represent average swelling ratio ±
standard deviation where n = 3.

Reversible temperature response, which reveals the potential
reusability
of a gel, is important for applications of hydrogels. In this study,
reversible temperature changes were designed to span the LCST of the
gels alternating between 10 and 50 °C, where gels went from being
almost completely swollen to completely collapsed. A plot of swelling
ratio versus temperature is shown in Figure 5. It was found that the gel reswelling ratios
at 10 °C for the second and third cycle were very similar to
the initial swelling ratio, indicating that the swelling–collapse
process of the gels was reversible.

gel and 44BDA gel set,
error bars represent average swelling ratio ± standard deviation
where n = 3.

2.5 LCST Measurements
The LCSTs of the
PEG control and 44BDA gels were measured by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). Results from the analysis are shown in Figure 6a for example thermograms
and (b) for LCST values. Endothermic peaks in the thermograms represent
the LCST where intramolecular hydrogen bonds are broken requiring
heat.3 PEG 0.9 control gel showed a LCST
of 32.8 °C, which was within the range of previously reported
literature values for homopolymer NIPAAm (32–33 °C).16,39−41 It is expected that the incorporation of hydrophobic
comonomers or crosslinkers will decrease the amount of intermolecular
hydrogen bonding, resulting in less heat being required to break the
hydrogen bonds and resulting in a decrease in LCST. From Figure 6, the LCST of the
gels showed the expected decrease with increasing amounts of 44BDA,
and the LCST shifted up 4.3 °C from that of the PEG control (32.8
°C) to that of the 44BDA 4.5 gel (28.5 °C).

3 Conclusions
The hydrophobic crosslinker 44BDA was successfully synthesized,
and NIPAAm was reacted with this novel crosslinker to form temperature-responsive
hydrogels through free radical polymerization. 44BDA content in the
hydrogel was varied from 0.9 to 4.5 mol %, and its effect on hydrogel
swelling behavior and LCST was studied. As more 44BDA was incorporated,
hydrogels showed decreased swelling ratios, and the difference was
especially significant in the low temperature region. Meanwhile, their
LCSTs were shifted to lower temperatures with increasing 44BDA. Higher
44BDA content gels exhibited broader phase transitions due to a high
degree of crosslinking. A reversible response to temperature change
was seen for those hydrogels, indicating good reusability for various
applications including environmental remediation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
4,4′-Dihydroxybiphenyl,
triethyl amine (TEA), acryloyl chloride (AC), N-isopryopylacrylamide
(NIPAAm, 97%), and ammonium persulfate (APS, ≥98%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis). Poly(ethylene glycol)
400 dimethacrylate (PEG400DMA) was purchased from Polysciences, Inc.
(Warrington). All solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetone, tetrahydrofuran
(THF), dichloromethane (DCM), and acetonitrile (ACN)), HCl, K2CO3, and magnesium sulfate were purchased from
VWR International (Radnor). Molecular sieves (3 Å) were added
to the solvents to remove any moisture present and to maintain the
anhydrous state of the solvents. Crosslinker 44BDA was synthesized
in the lab by acrylation of 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl.

4.2 Synthesis of 44BDA
44BDA was synthesized
using a modification to a method reported previously.42 Briefly, 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl was dissolved in
an excess amount of THF, followed by the addition of TEA and AC with
the ratio of TEA/AC/4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl of 3:3:1. AC was
added dropwise under continuous stirring in an ice bath. The acrylation
process was allowed to proceed overnight under dark conditions. The
mixture was then subjected to vacuum filtration to remove the precipitated
triethylammonium chloride salts. Next, THF from the filtrate was evaporated
under vacuum using a liquid N2 trap. The recovered 44BDA
was redissolved in DCM and purified by multiple washes with 0.1 M
K2CO3 and then 0.1 M HCl to remove any unreacted
AC and TEA. Then, magnesium sulfate was added to remove any remaining
water from the solution, followed by the second filtration of the
product. The final mixture was evaporated again under vacuum using
a liquid N2 trap to obtain a dry powdered product, and
this was stored at −20 °C until use. A combination of
mono- and diacrylates was obtained (see Figure 7 for their structures).

and (b) 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl diacrylate.

4.3 Confirming the Acrylation through High Performance
Liquid Chromatography
The synthesized 44BDA was characterized
using reverse-phase HPLC (Waters Phenomenex C18 column, 5 μm,
250 mm (length) × 4.6 mm (I.D.) on a Shimadzu Prominence LC-20
AB HPLC system). Samples were dissolved in ACN at 100 μg/mL.
A gradient from 50/50 ACN/water to 100/0 ACN/water over 24 min at
1 mL/min was used with the column chamber set at 40 °C. The absorbance
was measured from 260 to 370 nm.

4.4 Characterizing
the Molecular Weight of 44BDA
through Liquid Chromatography Time-of-Flight
Analysis of
44BDA was carried out using a Shimadzu HPLC coupled with a Sciex TripleTOF
5600 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. 44BDA was analyzed
using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18 column, 5 μM, 4.6 × 150
mm column (Agilent). The mobile phase consisted of water with 0.1%
TEA as solvent A and ACN with 0.1% TEA as solvent B. The flow rate
was 0.5 mL/min with a column temperature of 30 °C. The sample
injection volume was 10 μL. The mass spectrometer was operated
in the positive electrospray ionization mode with a curtain gas of
20 psi, ion spray voltage of 5500 V, ion source gas1/gas2 of 40 psi
and temperature of 550 °C.

4.5 Synthesis
of NIPAAm-co-44BDA Hydrogels
All gels were synthesized through
free radical polymerization (schematic
in Scheme 1). A control
system was synthesized by crosslinking NIPAAm with 0.9 mol % of PEG400DMA.
The 44BDA system was crosslinked with NIPAAm at five different compositions
(0.9, 1.8, 2.7, 3.6, and 4.5 mol %). For example, the 44BDA 0.9 gel
was synthesized by dissolving 6.6 mg of 44BDA with 280 mg of NIPAAm
in 1 mL of DMSO. The initiator, APS, was dissolved in DI water (0.5
mg/mL) and added at 4 wt % combined weight of NIPAAm and 44BDA. The
monomer and reactant solution was vortexed and purged with nitrogen
for 5 min. The mixture was then equally divided into five shell vials
with the top covered by a rubber stopper and allowed to react in a
preheated 80 °C water bath for 1 h. To remove any unreacted monomers,
the gel was washed with excess acetone followed by DI water (three
times each for 30 min per wash). Then, the gels were cut into small
pieces and freeze dried for 24 h until no further mass change occurred.
Reaction components for all other gels have been summarized in Table 1.

4.6 Swelling Studies
A series of swelling
studies were performed to test the swelling properties of the 44BDA
gels. First, the gels were swelled in DI water at 25 °C in an
isothermal water bath to study the equilibrium swelling kinetics.
Mass measurements were taken at time points of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8,
12, 24, and 48 h. The swelling ratio was defined as swollen mass divided
by dry mass as shown in eq 1. 1  Once the equilibrium swellings were obtained,
a temperature-dependent swelling study was conducted to determine
the swelling profile for each composition. In this study, gels were
swelled at temperature increments of 5 °C from 10 to 50 °C
for 24 h to reach equilibrium swelling, and mass swelling ratios at
each temperature were calculated. In this study, gels were placed
through three cycles in an isothermal water bath from swollen state
at 10 °C to a collapsed state at 50 °C, and mass swelling
ratios were recorded at each temperature after 24 h of swelling.

4.7 LCST Measurements
The LCSTs of the
hydrogels were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC
Q200, TA instruments Inc., New Castle). Hydrogels were allowed to
swell completely for at least 24 h in DI water. A small piece of gel
was gently dabbed dry, placed in a T-zero pan, and the mass was carefully
recorded. The sample was hermetically sealed in the T-zero pan and
placed along with a reference pan on the heater. Samples were then
heated from 10 to 50 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min under a dry
nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 50 mL/min.
