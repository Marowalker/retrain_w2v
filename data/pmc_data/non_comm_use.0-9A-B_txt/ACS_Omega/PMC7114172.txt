Human-β-defensins
(HBD1-3) are antibacterial peptides containing
three disulphide bonds. In the present study, the effect of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the
antibacterial activities of HBD2-3, C-terminal analogues having a
single disulphide bond, Phd1-3, and their corresponding myristoylated
analogues MPhd1-3 were investigated. The effect of LPS on the activities
of linear amphipathic peptides melittin, LL37 and non-ribosomally
synthesized peptides, polymyxin B, alamethicin, gramicidin A, and
gramicidin S was also examined. The antibacterial activity of HBD
2-3, Phd1-3, and MPhd1-3 in the presence of LPS against E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited. While LPS inhibited the antibacterial activity of
LL37, the inhibition of melittin activity was partial. The hemolytic
activity exhibited by MPhd1, MPhd3, melittin, and LL37 was inhibited
in the presence of LPS. HBD2-3, Phd1-3, and MPhd1-3 also showed endotoxin
neutralizing activity. The antibacterial and hemolytic activities
of polymyxin B, alamethicin, gramicidin A, and gramicidin S were not
inhibited in the presence of LPS. Fluorescence assays employing dansyl
cadaverine showed that HBD2-3 and defensin analogues bind to LPS more
strongly as compared to alamethicin, gramicidin A, and gramicidin
S. Electron microscopy images indicated that peptides disintegrate
the structure of LPS. The inhibition of the antibacterial activity
of native defensins and analogues in the presence of LPS indicates
that the initial interaction with the bacterial surface is similar.
The native defensin sequence or structure is also not essential, although
cationic charges are necessary for binding to LPS. Hydrophobic interaction
is the main driving force for association of non-ribosomally synthesized
polymyxin B, alamethicin, gramicidin A, and gramicidin S with LPS.
It is likely that these peptides rapidly insert into membranes and
do not interact with the bacterial cell surface, whereas cationic
peptides such as β-defensin and their analogues, melittin and
LL37, first interact with the bacterial cell surface and then the
membrane. Our results suggest that evaluating interaction of antibacterial
and hemolytic peptides with LPS is a compelling way of elucidating
the mechanism of bacterial killing or hemolysis.

Introduction
Human-β-defensins
(HBDs) are cationic antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs) containing three disulfide bonds having a broad spectrum antibacterial
and anti-inflammatory activities.1−7 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major constituent of the cell wall of
Gram-negative bacteria, is released during bacterial cell division
or death on administration of therapeutic antibiotics. It is a potent
stimulant of immune response that causes sepsis.8 It has a dual purpose, protecting the bacteria from their
surroundings, and as an effector molecule by initiating an immune
response against the invading bacteria.9 Several investigations have indicated that AMPs bind to LPS and
exhibit antibacterial activity and LPS detoxification activity.10−15 Human enteric α-defensin 5, in the reduced form, is able to
suppress the pro-inflammatory effect of bacterial LPS by blocking
the interaction between LPS and LPS-binding protein.11 Studies on the structure–activity relationship of
anti-endotoxic activity of AMPs and their analogues have been reported.16,17 A higher minimum inhibitory concentration of some AMPs is observed
for Gram-negative bacteria because of LPS that is present in the outer
membrane as compared to Gram-positive organisms.18 LPS also induced aggregation of AMPs that resulted in their
complete inactivation, which is evident in frog skin temporins and
Leu/Lys and K12-designed peptides.19−25 Linear membrane active peptides on the interaction with LPS micelles
showed distinct α-helical conformation.26−30 This structure is likely to favor insertion of the
peptide into the lipid bilayer because of electrostatic interactions
with the negatively charged phospholipids in the membrane bilayer
of bacteria.27 Biophysical studies on the
interaction of AMPs with LPS suggest that the overall biophysical
properties required to kill bacteria are not the same as the ones
to neutralize LPS. The chemical properties of the peptide that are
required for each function are: sequence, cationic charge, an amphipathic
structure, affinity for LPS, ability to traverse the LPS layer, and
to disaggregate LPS micelles.21 The interaction
of AMPs with the bacterial membrane surface is an important step for
microbial killing. The cationic and hydrophobic characteristics of
peptides and cell wall components of bacteria play important roles
in insertion and translocation of peptides toward the cytosolic membrane.31,32 However, the precise mechanism and physicochemical properties of
the AMPs required for interactions with bacterial LPS and anti-endotoxin
activity remains to be established unequivocally.

AMPs are considered
to be very attractive candidates for development
as therapeutic agents against drug-resistant bacterial pathogens as
well as to neutralize LPS. Several analogues and covalent chemical
modifications have been attempted in AMPs that display selectivity
for bacterial membranes and to increase their antibacterial potency.31,32 Earlier, we had reported antibacterial and hemolytic activities
of C-terminal cationic segments of bovine-β-defensin BNBD2 analogues
(P1-4) and mammalian β-defensins HBD1-3 analogues (Phd1-3) having
a majority of the cationic residues present in native defensins, containing
a single disulfide bond exhibited salt sensitive antibacterial activity
without hemolytic activity.33,34 Attempts were made
to reduce the salt sensitivity by N-terminal fatty acylation of these
analogues; palmitoylation for BNBD2 analogues (P1-4) and myristoylation
for HBD1-3 analogues (Phd1-3) that increases the hydrophobicity of
the peptides and favors association with the membrane.35,36 Myristoylated HBD1-3 analogues (MPhd1-3) exhibited enhanced antibacterial
potency and MPhd1, 3 exhibited hemolytic activity.36 Improved salt sensitive antibacterial activity was observed
for MPhd1-2.36 It is of interest to examine
the interaction of defensins and their analogues with LPS because
these peptides are neither amphipathic nor helical. In the present
study, the effect of interaction of LPS with native HBDs HBD2-3, myristoylated,
and non-myristoylated C-terminal segments of HBD1-3 (MPhd1-3 and Phd1-3)
on their antibacterial and hemolytic activities was investigated.
Linear amphipathic host-defense peptides LL37, melittin, and non-ribosomally
synthesized antibacterial peptides polymyxin B, alamethicin, gramicidin
A, and gramicidin S were also used to delineate the physicochemical
properties of peptides that are involved in their selective interaction
with the bacterial and RBC membrane in the presence of Escherichia coli LPS.

Results
Peptides
investigated in this study are C-terminal segments of
HBD1-3, Phd1-3 having positively charged residues at different positions,
their N-terminal myristoylated analogues, full-length defensins HBD2-3,
and linear amphipathic antibacterial peptides, LL37, melittin, and
peptides with noncoded amino acids, polymyxin B, alamethicin, gramicidin
A, and gramicidin S (sequences except HBD2-3, are shown in Table 1). The interaction
of these peptides with LPS was investigated at their respective minimal
bactericidal concentrations (MBC) at which no viable colonies are
formed (Table 2), to
understand the importance of the sequence, net charge, and structure
for antibacterial, hemolytic, and LPS neutralization activities.

The inhibition of hemolytic activity of MPhd1 and MPhd3 at different
concentrations of the peptide at a ratio (w/w 1:5) of LPS E. coli K-235 is shown in Figure 5A,B. Significant decrease in hemolytic activity

LPS E. coli K-235 neutralization
activity with HBD2-3, Phd1-3, and MPhd1-3 was assayed by using a commercially
available semi-quantitative Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) E-TOXATE
kit.39 Depending on the LPS concentration
in the sample, LAL reagent results could range from increasing the
viscosity to the formation of a hard gel. Samples are considered positive
for LPS when the formed gel does not collapse after the sample tube
is inverted vertically.39 Inverted test
tubes used to determine the LPS level are shown in Figure 7. Gel formation was not observed
in any of the peptide-treated samples with LPS indicating native defensins
as well as analogues have LPS neutralization activity.

Images show inverted test tubes of endotoxin control and tested defensin
analogues. The surface of the generated gels of LPS E. coli K-235 at a concentration (0.2 EU/mL) is shown
in the control tubes. Images are representative of 2 independent experiments
(photos in this figure were taken by Krishnakumari and Taniya Mary
Binny).

The binding affinity of HBD2-3,
defensin analogues Phd1-3 and MPhd1-3,
amphipathic peptides LL37, melittin, polymyxin B, alamethicin, gramicidin
A, and gramicidin S to LPS E.coli K-235
was investigated using dansyl cadaverine (DC) which binds lipid A
of LPS and is displaced by molecules which has an affinity for lipid
A. The data are shown in Figure 8A,B. The addition of LPS to DC results in the enhancement
of the fluorescence intensity accompanied by a blue shift in the emission
maximum wavelength which is indicative of interactions of DC with
LPS molecules. The addition of the displacer or peptide to the mixture
of LPS and DC results in the decrease of fluorescence intensity. The
addition of the displacer to DC alone indicates no such effects. This
is indicative of the displacement of bound DC from LPS by the displacer.
The quenching of the fluorescence intensity as a function of a given
peptide concentration is represented as an occupancy factor. Polymyxin
B was used as a positive control that has been shown to form stable
molecular complexes with the lipid A portion of LPS and its binding
involve both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.40 The binding data for HBD2-3 and analogues Phd1-3
and MPhd1-3 to LPS are shown in Figure 8A. The control peptides HBD2-3 showed more affinity
to LPS compared to their analogues. Phd1 and MPhd1 have more affinity
as compared to Phd2-3 and MPhd2-3. The binding data for amphipathic
peptides to LPS are shown in Figure 8B. Polymyxin B has strong binding compared to HBD2-3
as well as LL37 and melittin. The pore forming peptides alamethicin,
gramicidin A, and gramicidin S have weak affinity as compared to polymyxin
B and their affinity saturated around 0.5 of occupancy factor.

The CD spectra of non-myristoylated and myristoylated peptides
recorded in buffer and in the presence of LPS E. coli K-235 at a ratio (1:5), indicated that no structural changes were
observed for Phd1-3 and MPhd1-3 with LPS (Figure S1).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of
LPS E. coli K-235 obtained in the absence
and in the
presence of peptides are shown in Figure 9. LPS in aqueous solution shows aggregated
structures. This result also indicates the formation of large inhomogeneous
aggregates of LPS. In contrast, TEM images confirmed the disaggregation
of the assembly of LPS to small dense spherical particles of LPS molecules
in the presence of peptides at both (w/w 1:1) and (w/w 1:5) peptide/LPS
ratios.

Discussion
Many therapeutic antibiotics have bactericidal effects but they
cannot effectively prevent septic shock caused by LPS because of a
lack of ability to neutralize LPS.41,42 Hence, there
has been interest in examining whether cationic AMPs, particularly
that are a part of host-defense arsenal, can interact with LPS and
make them unavailable to cause septic shock. AMPs interact initially
with the outer membrane of bacteria. The arrangement of amino acids
in the AMP sequence, which determines the structure of the peptide,
favors interaction with pathogen surfaces made up of proteins, glycan
chains, or surface lipids.43 HBDs are host-defense
antibacterial peptides for protection against invading microbes. Defensins
kill bacteria by mechanisms different from therapeutic antibiotics.
Their initial site of action is the bacterial cell surface, where
they interact with LPS in Gram-negative bacteria and peptidoglycan
in Gram-positive bacteria.44 This interaction
does not result in detergent-like solubilization of the bacterial
surface but a pathway is created for an approach to the bacterial
“plasma” or cytoplasmic membrane where they exert their
activity to kill bacteria. Defensins are also internalized in bacteria
wherein they cause destabilization of bacterial metabolism.44,45 Defensins have bactericidal activities and some of them lose their
activities in the physiological concentration of NaCl.2−4 They also have LPS-neutralizing activity depending on the LPS, from
different species of bacteria.10 In the
present study, we have examined the effect of E. coli LPS O26:B6 and E. coli LPS K-235
which differ in length of the polysaccharide chain,23,46 on the bactericidal and hemolytic activities of full length human
defensins and their active analogues to delineate the contributions
of the peptide sequence and structure for their interaction with LPS.
The interaction of nonspecific membrane lytic linear amphipathic peptides
and the cyclic peptide gramicidin S with LPS was also examined.

LPS effectively inhibits the antibacterial activity of Phd1-3,
MPhd1-3, and HBD2-3 against E. coli and S. aureus. Relative binding affinities
of HBD2-3, defensin analogues, amphipathic peptides, and LPS binding
peptides, polymyxin B examined in terms of their ability to displace
DC from LPS, indicate that the HBD2-3, defensin analogues, and other
peptides bind to LPS with lower affinity compared to polymyxin B.
However, the binding affinity of peptides was not reflected in their
inhibition of antibacterial activity in the presence of LPS. In addition,
the binding did not result in structural changes in the defensin analogues,
indicating that the interaction is electrostatic and the peptide chain
is not intimately associated with the LPS. The importance of the cationic
nature of the peptides for LPS interaction is evident from the lack
of inhibition of antibacterial activity of alamethicin that has one
negative charge, gramicidin S that has two positive charges and gramicidin
A which has no charge. The chemical structure of LPS varies among
different species of bacteria, with each species expressing structurally
heterogeneous LPS molecules.47 The amphiphilic
nature of LPS results in the formation of oligomers above a critical
concentration (CMC). CMC of LPS E. coli 026:B6 is 14 μg/mL.48 CMC is considered
to be directly proportional to the polysaccharide chain length. E. coli K-235 will have low CMC compared to E. coli 026:B6. There are reports that both monomeric
and aggregated forms of LPS exhibited pro-inflammatory responses.49,50 EM studies indicate the association of defensin analogues and other
peptides polymyxin B, alamethicin, gramicidin A, cyclic gramicidin
S, melittin, and LL37 with LPS results in the disintegration of LPS
aggregates. The disaggregation of LPS is evident both at higher and
lower ratios of the peptide to LPS. Studies on defensins have shown
that certain aromatic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, and Arg play a
dominant role in stabilizing the peptide-pathogen surface complexes.43 It is possible that the cationic defensin peptides
and LPS are intimately associated, indicating that free peptide is
excluded at a higher ratio of the peptide to LPS (w/w 1:5), due to
which the peptides are unable to interact with the bacterial cell
surface, which is the first step in bacterial killing. This interaction
also displayed their activities in limulus amebocyte lysate assay
which results in the loss of LPS ability to cause coagulation of haemolymph.
Hydrophobic interactions are the main driving force for the insertion
of non-ribosomally synthesized peptides such as polymyxin B, alamethicin,
gramicidin A, and gramicidin S. Polymyxin B and gramicidin S can also
neutralize LPS. The mechanism of Gram-negative bacterial killing by
gramicidin S and polymyxin B involves initial interaction with LPS
resulting in a self-promoted uptake.51 It
is likely that the peptides rapidly insert into membranes and do not
interact with the bacterial cell surface. While the LPS structure
appears to be disintegrated by these peptides but they may not be
bound to the debris as they can kill bacteria.

Association of
MPhd1, MPhd3 and melittin as well as LL37 with LPS
also prevents their hemolytic activity indicating the intimate association
of these peptides with LPS after disintegration. In the case of alamethicin,
gramicidin A, and gramicidin S no inhibition of hemolysis is observed.
Alamethicin, gramicidin A, and gramicidin S form highly ordered structures
and form channels in membranes.52−54 Gramicidin A and alamethicin
can interact with the fatty acyl chains of LPS, perturb the LPS, and
then associate with the bacterial inner membrane which is the site
of action. When this type of mechanism is operational, LPS does not
inhibit their ability to kill bacteria as well as to lyse RBCs. Our
results suggest that evaluating the interaction of antibacterial and
hemolytic peptides with LPS is a compelling way of elucidating the
mechanism of bacterial killing or hemolysis.

In nature, defensins
may have evolved with twin roles of inhibiting
bacterial killing and neutralizing LPS activity. Because bacterial
killing would be the early event, subsequent binding of defensins
with LPS would not affect the role of defensins in bacterial killing.
Whereas, once LPS is removed from the pathogen, the disaggregated
LPS–peptide complex causes neutralization of LPS. Our present
study suggests a possible dual role even for defensin analogues in
host defense. This study also suggests that evaluating the interaction
of antibacterial and hemolytic peptides with LPS could be of help
in elucidating the mechanism of bacterial killing or hemolysis.

× 250 mm)] as described earlier. The molecular masses of HPLC-purified
Phd1-3 and MPhd1-3 were confirmed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometer (AB4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF) from Applied
Biosystems (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the in-house
proteomics facility (Figure S2).

Effects
of LPS on Antibacterial Activity
Antibacterial
activity of the peptides against bacterial strains of wild-type E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 (CGSC-7740) subsequently
referred to as E. coli and S. aureus (ATCC 8530) in the presence of LPS was
determined as described earlier.34,36,38 Bacteria was grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C.
After 20 h, 0.2 mL from this suspension was subcultured for 3 h in
20 mL of LB broth to obtain a mid-log-phase culture. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with 10 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4 (PB), to remove LB medium. Cells were resuspended in the same
buffer, and the concentration was adjusted to 106 colony-forming
units (cfu)/mL. Peptides Phd1-3, MPhd1-3, and HBD2, 3 were diluted
to their MBC (MBC is the concentration of the peptides at which no
viable colonies formed) as determined earlier.34,36,38 The protocol used was similar to the one
used for defensins55,56 because their activity in the
presence of the salt is attenuated. MBC concentrations were mixed
with LPS E. coli K-235 or LPS E. coli 026:B6 at different ratios (w/w 1:1 or w/w
1:5). LL37, melittin, alamethicin, gramicidin A, gramicidin S, and
polymyxin B diluted to their MBC and mixed with LPS E. coli K-235 at a fixed ratio (w/w 1:1 or w/w 1:5).
After incubation with LPS for 30 min, 106 cfu/mL cells
were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in sterile 96-well
plates in a final volume of 100 μL. Suitably diluted aliquots
were spread on LB agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C
for 18 h. The cfu were counted, and percentage killing of bacteria
relative to the cfu in untreated controls was calculated which was
determined from the average of the three independent experiments done
in duplicates.

Effects of LPS on Hemolytic Activity
Red blood cells
were isolated from heparinized rat blood by centrifugation and washed
thrice with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.15 M NaCl
just before the assays were performed. LPS E. coli K-235 at a ratio (w/w 1:5) was mixed with peptides MPhd1, 3, and
LL37, melittin, alamethicin, gramicidin A, and gramicidin S at different
concentrations in duplicates in Eppendorf tubes and aliquots of cell
suspension (107/mL) were added and incubated at 37 °C
for 30 min with gentle mixing. The samples were centrifuged and the
absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm. The lysis obtained
with 1% Triton X-100 was considered as 100%. The percentage lysis
was calculated. The experiments were repeated thrice with duplicate
samples.

LPS Binding Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence
measurements were carried out on a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer
to study the binding affinity of HBD2-3 Phd1-3, MPhd1-3, LL37, melittin,
polymyxin B, alamethicin, gramicidin A, and gramicidin S with LPS E. coli K-235. DC a fluorescent probe specifically
binds to LPS and its displacement from LPS by the peptides results
in dequenching of its fluorescence.57 The
samples were excited at 340 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded
from 420 to 600 nm. The excitation and emission slits were set to
2.5 and 5 nm, respectively. All measurements were carried out at 25
°C. The fluorescence spectrum of DC (12 μM) was recorded
and fluorimetric titrations were carried out with increasing concentration
of LPS in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and maximum fluorescence intensity
was observed at (280 μg/mL) LPS concentration. Increasing concentrations
of the displacer was added and dequenching fluorescence intensity
was recorded. Initially, the displacement experiment was done using
polymyxin B as a positive control. Subsequently, the experiment with
other peptides was carried out in a similar manner. Occupancy factor
(F – F0)/(Fmax – F0)
was calculated, where F0 is the fluorescence
intensity of DC alone, Fmax is the intensity
in the presence of the maximum LPS concentration and F are the intensities of the DC–LPS mixture at different displacer
(peptide) concentrations. The estimation of occupancy in this manner
implies a value of 1 at zero displacer concentration (F = Fmax) and 0 when DC is completely
displaced with an excess of the displacing ligand (F = F0).

LPS Neutralization Assay
The peptides’ ability
to neutralize LPS activity was assayed by using a commercially available
semi-quantitative LAL E-TOXATE kit.39 The
protocol explained in the manufacturer’s instructions was followed.
The LPS in Gram-negative bacteria, activates a pro-enzyme in the LAL.
The peptides were dissolved in the pyrogen-free water supplied with
the kit, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 N HCl which is prepared
in pyrogen-free water. Peptides were incubated with 0.2 endotoxin
units (EU) of LPS E. coli K-235 at
a peptide-LPS ratio (w/w 1:5) in a volume of 50 μL for 30 min,
and 50 μL of LAL reagent was added to the peptide–EU
complex and further incubated for 60 min at 37 °C without shaking.
After an incubation of 60 min for the reaction, gel formation was
recorded.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Defensins analogues
Phd1-3, MPhd1-3, and amphipathic peptides polymyxin B, LL37, melittin,
alamethicin, gramicidin A, and gramicidin S were incubated with LPS E. coli K-235 (0.1 mg/mL) at ratios (w/w 1:1) and
(w/w 1:5) for 30 min in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Then, 1 μL
aliquot was placed on a formvar coated copper grid, stained with 1%
uranyl acetate, dried, and imaged in a JEOL JEM 2100 electron microscope
at 120 kV. An LPS control sample without incubation with peptides
was prepared in the same manner.
