Ultraviolet (UV)-durable superhydrophobic
nanocomposite thin films
have been successfully fabricated on aluminum substrates by embedding
cobalt stearate (CoSA)-coated TiO2 nanoparticles in a hydrophobic
polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) matrix (PMHS/TiO2@CoSA)
using the sol–gel process. When compared to the sharp decrease
of water contact angle (WCA) on the superhydrophobic PMHS/TiO2 thin films, the PMHS/TiO2@CoSA superhydrophobic
thin films exhibited a nearly constant WCA of 160° under continuous
UV irradiation for more than 1 month. The designed scheme of the TiO2@CoSA core–shell structure not only increased the hydrophobic
properties of the TiO2 nanoparticle surface but also confined
the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 nanoparticles. A
plausible model has been suggested to explain the UV-durable mechanism
of the superhydrophobic nanocomposite thin films based on PMHS/TiO2@CoSA. Furthermore, the elongated lifetime in the exposure
of the solar light imparts this superhydrophobic nanocomposite thin
film with potential practical applications where UV-resistant properties
are emphasized including corrosion-resistant building walls, anti-icing
airplanes, self-cleaning vehicles, and so forth.

Introduction
Superhydrophobicity,
as inspired by the “Lotus effect”
in nature, features a water contact angle (WCA) above 150°. The
water repellency of a surface is governed by a combination of chemical
composition and geometrical surface structure. Superhydrophobic thin
films have attracted great attention in a wide range of applications
including antifouling paints,1 waterproof
clothes,2 corrosion inhibition,3 water and oil separation,4 and so forth. Recently, superhydrophobic thin films incorporating
wide band gap semiconductor oxide nanoparticles such as TiO2 (band gap: 3.2 eV), ZnO (3.4 eV), and CeO2 (3.1 eV) have
attracted increased interest because of their ultraviolet (UV) absorption
and self-cleaning properties.5−12 These superhydrophobic thin films were converted to hydrophilic
films because of the photocatalytic properties of these nanoparticles.
In other words, these thin films changed their wetting properties
from the Cassie state13 to the Wenzel state14 via the exposure to UV radiation.5−12 Nishimoto et al.8 reported the hydrophilic
transformation of a superhydrophobic surface based on TiO2 porous layers passivated with a self-assembled monolayer of octadodecylphosphonic
acid because of UV radiation in just 30 min. Similarly, polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS)-coated TiO2 nanoparticles turned hydrophilic in
6 h because of the UV exposure as reported by Zhang et al.15

In the recent years, several works have
been performed on UV-protective
superhydrophobic thin films on substrates such as metals, cottons,
and fabrics.6,16−24 Most works used TiO2 nanoparticles as a UV absorber and
organic compounds to lower the surface energy to fabricate UV-protective
superhydrophobic surfaces.6,16−21 Recently, Gao et al. used fluoroalkylsilane (FAS)-modified TiO2 nanoparticles to fabricate superhydrophobic thin films that
converted to hydrophilic [contact angle (CA) = 2°] following
an exposure to UV radiation for 24 h.16 This conversion from superhydrophobicity to hydrophilicity was an
expected phenomenon as the fabricated thin film contained only a monolayer
of FAS on TiO2. However, contradictory reports over FAS-coated
superhydrophobic surfaces state that it is possible to maintain the
superhydrophobic properties upon prolonged exposure to UV radiation.24 Wang et al. have demonstrated stable superhydrophobic
properties on steel surfaces even after 50 h of exposure to UV radiation.24 The UV durability was ascribed to the long chain
of FAS-17 on the surface, which could provide a large number of C–F
bonds (i.e., −(CF2)7–CF3 chain). This C–F bond, with a bond energy of 485 kJ/mol,
cannot be broken by the UV light (314–419 kJ/mol).24

In another work by Gao et al., epoxy resin-covered
TiO2 nanoparticles were used to fabricate superhydrophobic
filter papers.
These authors showed that the WCA on the surface of the filter paper
slightly decreased to 151° ± 0.5° from 153° ±
1° after more than 300 min of UV exposure.17 However, there was no information on the stability of the
superhydrophobic properties after a long-term exposure as presented
in our work. In another work by Wang et al., the superhydrophobic
surfaces prepared by TiO2/polybenzoxazine nanoassemblies
became hydrophilic upon exposure to UV radiation of only 300 s.19

Qing et al. used TiO2 nanoparticles
covered by PDMS
layers to make superhydrophobic thin films which demonstrated corrosion
resistance. These films, however, failed to maintain their superhydrophobic
properties after only 20 min of exposure to UV radiation, and their
CA reduced drastically from 162.3° to 75.6° converting to
hydrophilic surfaces. Surprisingly, a postheat treatment of these
surfaces at 120 °C for 30 min restored the superhydrophobicity.18 In another work, the reversibly switchable wettability
of the FAS–TiO2/poly(vinylidene difluoride) composite
surface was investigated through the serial alternating of UV exposure
and heat treatment.6 They observed that
the CA decreased sharply as the UV irradiation time increased, converting
a superhydrophobic surface with a CA of 160° to superhydrophilic
with a CA of 0° just after 60 min. Interestingly, it was observed
that it took only 40 min to revert to the original CA when these surfaces
were heated at a temperature of 180 °C.6

Several smart ideas have been utilized to obtain UV-durable
superhydrophobic
surfaces.5,7,10,25−27 Ding et al.26 reported a UV-durable superhydrophobic fluorinated polysiloxane/TiO2 nanocomposite coating because of the fact that Si–O
and C–F bonds in the fluorinated polymer matrix were stable
against photocatalytic reactions of TiO2 nanoparticles.
It is noteworthy to mention that fluorinated silanes are quite expensive,
environmentally unfriendly, and not appropriate for practical applications.
Similarly, in a study of Gao et al.,5 a
transparent and UV-durable superhydrophobic surface was fabricated
by passivating the arrays of the SiO2-coated ZnO nanorods
with perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane. The physical barrier of the SiO2 layers was responsible for the UV resistance property. However,
both of their fabrication processes are complex, and a further modification
of the hydrophilic SiO2 shell with low-surface-energy materials
is always inevitable.

In the present study, a facile, low-cost,
and effective sol–gel
spin-coating method has been developed to fabricate UV-durable superhydrophobic
thin films. With this method, initially, TiO2 nanoparticles
are coated with cobalt stearate (CoSA) and this core–shell
(TiO2@CoSA) material is further incorporated in the ethanolic
polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) solution. The sol–gel spin-coated
thin films prepared with this mixture are found to be superhydrophobic
with high UV durability properties. A model has been proposed to explain
the UV durability mechanism of this material.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a-I,II shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pure stearic acid (SA) powder
and CoSA films, respectively, on aluminum substrates in the 2θ
scan range of 3°–30°. Figure 1a-I shows the characteristic peaks at the
2θ values of 6.76°, 20.35°, 21.61°, and 24.29°,
assigned to the SA (#JCPDS stearic acid: 00-009-0618). The XRD pattern
of CoSA (Figure 1a-II)
shows a series of equidistant diffraction peaks situated at 3.61°,
5.42°, 7.22°, 9.02°, 10.81°, 12.62°, 14.44°,
and 16.24°. The origin of these equidistant peaks in the diffraction
pattern is attributable to the layered structure of CoSA. The average
distance between the two peaks has been calculated to be 1.80°
± 0.01°. Hence, an initial peak would be expected to be
situated at 2θ equal to 1.81°. Luo et al.28 have reported the appearance of a peak in a position similar
to that in the Langmuir–Blodgett thin film of CoSA. We have
not observed this first peak in our study as we have performed the
experiment at the initial angle of 3°. Lowering the diffraction
angle may cause permanent damage to the detector because of the possibility
of direct bombardment of the high intensity of X-ray to the detector.
It is noteworthy to mention that we have observed 12 distinct characteristic
diffraction peaks of CoSA as compared to only the 4 peaks reported
by Luo et al.28

Figure 1 (a) Low-angle XRD patterns
of (I) SA powder and (II) CoSA thin
films and (b) ATR–FTIR spectra of (I) SA powder and (II) CoSA
thin films. The inset in (a) shows the corresponding UV–vis
absorption spectrum of CoSA coated on quartz substrates.

The inset of Figure 1a shows the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption
spectrum of the drop-coated CoSA films on quartz substrates in the
light wavelength range of 200–400 nm. A strong absorption peak
is observed at around 210 nm. This result is comparable to the UV–vis
spectrum of copper stearate.29 It is noteworthy
to mention that the UV–vis spectrum of CoSA is not available
in the literature.

Figure 1b-I,II reveals
the attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR)
spectra of pure SA powder and the drop-coated CoSA film, respectively.
In the high-frequency region of the two spectra, the adsorption peaks
at 2847 and 2914 cm–1 are attributed to the asymmetric
and symmetric stretching vibrations of −CH2 groups,
respectively. One tiny peak assigned to the asymmetric stretching
of −CH3 is observed at 2939 cm–1.3,30 In the mid-frequency region, a distinct sharp peak
of the carboxyl (−COOH) group of SA is observed at 1701 cm–1, as shown in Figure 1b-I. It is noteworthy to mention that this peak, associated
with the carboxyl group, disappears in the CoSA thin films (Figure 1b-II). Interestingly,
and on the contrary, Figure 1b-II shows two distinct peaks observed at 1410 and 1550 cm–1 corresponding to the carboxylate (−COOCo)
symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations, respectively.31 Another peak in between these two peaks appearing
at 1446 cm–1 is ascribed to −CH2 bending.31,32 In the low-frequency range, a
sharp absorption peak at 720 cm–1 is attributed
to the in-plane rocking vibrations of −(CH2)n long carbon chains in the CoSA molecules.31 In brief, XRD, ATR–FTIR, and UV–vis
results confirm that CoSA has been successfully synthesized.

Anatase phase of the TiO2 nanoparticle is well-known
for the use of photodegradation11,33,34 of organic compounds because of the wide photonic band gap of 3.2
eV. Therefore, we have used anatase TiO2 nanoparticles
of size 100 nm to study photodegradation as well as to counter the
photodegradation using our synthesized CoSA in the thin films. It
is extremely significant to develop UV-durable superhydrophobic thin
films especially for painting the exterior surfaces such as building
walls which are normally exposed to the UV light directly from the
sun.35 A comparative UV degradation study
has been performed on two superhydrophobic thin films prepared by
a sol–gel process using (i) TiO2 nanoparticles and
PMHS (coded as PMHS/TiO2) and (ii) CoSA-modified TiO2 nanoparticles and PMHS (coded as PMHS/TiO2@CoSA)
in our UV chamber developed in-house.

The red plot of Figure 2a shows the variation
of the WCA on the PMHS/TiO2 thin films with respect to
the UV irradiation time. The initial
superhydrophobic PMHS/TiO2 thin films exhibit a WCA of
∼152° (shown in the inset) and a contact angle hysteresis
(CAH) of ∼6°. After 1 h of exposure to UV radiation, the
WCA of this film decreased to ∼119°, losing the rolling-off
properties. With the UV irradiation time increasing to 2 h, the WCA
of the PMHS/TiO2 thin films was found to be only ∼44°.
It is important to note that the static and dynamic CAs may be influenced
by the size, shape, and movement of the water drop.36,37

Figure 2 (a)

and PMHS/TiO2@CoSA (black square) superhydrophobic thin
films as a function of UV irradiation time. The inset in (a) shows
the water drop on the corresponding surfaces; (b) ATR–FTIR
spectra of (I) PMHS liquid and (II) PMHS/TiO2@CoSA superhydrophobic
thin films. The inset in (b) shows the ATR–FTIR spectra specifically
in the range of 3050–2750 cm–1; (c) XRD patterns
of (I) aluminum substrates, (II) PMHS/TiO2, and (III) PMHS/TiO2@CoSA; and (d) EDS spectra of (d-I) PMHS/TiO2@CoSA
and (d-II) PMHS/TiO2.

The superhydrophobic PMHS/TiO2 thin films were
completely
converted to superhydrophilic films after UV irradiation of 4 h because
of the photocatalytic effect of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles.33 The low-surface-energy PMHS was decomposed by
highly reactive superoxide and hydroxyl radicals generated by TiO2 nanoparticles under UV irradiation.33,38 Similar photodegradation and polymerization processes induced by
ZnO nanoparticles have been studied recently by Schmitt.39,40 He further reported the formation of silanes and siloxanes by Raman
spectroscopy.41

A model has been
presented in Figure 3b to explain the degradation mechanism. By
contrast, Figure 2a
(black square) shows that the WCA remains nearly constant after more
than 300 h of UV irradiation for the PMHS/TiO2@CoSA superhydrophobic
thin films. Although the data have been presented for 300 h, we have
observed that these films retain their superhydrophobic properties
even after more than 1000 h of UV irradiation. The initial WCA of
160° (CAH = 2°) reduced only slightly to 156° (CAH
= 5°) after 300 h of UV irradiation. The intensity of the UV
light in our in-house UV chamber is much stronger than that in the
direct sunlight, indicating that the PMHS/TiO2@CoSA superhydrophobic
thin films have great potential in outdoor applications. This highly
UV-durable superhydrophobic thin film with water roll-off properties
can be regarded as a potential candidate for creating an excellent
self-cleaning material as well. It is to be noted that the photo-Kolbe
reaction leads to radicals which might result in a protective layer
around the embedded TiO2 particles similar to that reported
by Schmitt on ZnO nanoparticles.39

Figure 3 (a) SEM image
and (b) schematic model of the PMHS/TiO2@CoSA superhydrophobic
thin films on the aluminum substrate. The
inset in (a) shows water drops on these thin films.

Figure 2b shows
the ATR–FTIR spectra of the chemical groups of the pure PMHS
organosilane liquid (Figure 2b-I) and the superhydrophobic PMHS/TiO2@CoSA thin
films (Figure 2b-II).
In the high-frequency region, the spectrum of PMHS displays a single
peak at 2969 cm–1, which is assigned to the asymmetric
stretching mode of −CH3 groups in the PMHS molecule.
The spectrum of the superhydrophobic PMHS/TiO2@CoSA thin
film (the inset top graph of Figure 2b) shows two peaks at 2914 and 2853 cm–1 attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of −CH2 groups, respectively, arising from CoSA, beside the absorption
peak of −CH3. In the mid-frequency region, a tiny
peak is observed at 1450 cm–1 because of the −COOCo
bonds. It can be seen that the intensity of this peak is very low
because the number of −COOCo bonds in the composite films is
calculated to be hardly 2% of that of Si–O–Si or Si–CH3 bonds. It is a known fact that the signals of FTIR peaks
are proportional to the number of corresponding chemical bonds.

In the mid-frequency region, the peak at 2162 cm–1 arising from the Si–H groups of PMHS shown in Figure 2b-I is no longer observed in
the spectrum of the superhydrophobic PMHS/TiO2@CoSA surfaces
in Figure 2b-II. This
indicates that the cross-linked polymer matrix has been formed by
PMHS organosilanes through condensation reactions of Si–H groups
during the sol–gel process.42 The
two peaks at 1270 and 764 cm–1 correspond to Si–CH3 groups. In addition, the double peaks present at 1112 and
1026 cm–1 are ascribed to the Si–O–Si
groups of PMHS organosilanes after the formation of oligomers.42 Furthermore, the absorption peak of Ti–O
groups is displayed at quite a low frequency, in the region near 500
cm–1, indicating the existence of TiO2 nanoparticles in our UV-durable superhydrophobic thin films.

Figure 2c depicts
the XRD spectra of the as-received aluminum substrates (Figure 2c-I) and PMHS/TiO2 (Figure 2c-II) and
PMHS/TiO2@CoSA superhydrophobic thin films (Figure 2c-III) in the scan range of
22°–58°. The two distinct peaks observed at 38.4°
and 44.7° on the XRD pattern of the as-received aluminum substrates
are attributed to the characteristic peaks of Al(111) and Al(200).
In addition, the XRD patterns of PMHS/TiO2 and PMHS/TiO2@CoSA superhydrophobic thin films coated with aluminum substrates
show the characteristic peaks of aluminum as well as the characteristic
peaks of TiO2(101), TiO2(200), TiO2(105), and TiO2(211) at 25.3°, 48.1°, 53.9°,
and 55.1°, respectively, confirming the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles in the thin films.

Figure 2d shows
the energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) spectra of different elements
in the superhydrophobic thin films PMHS/TiO2@CoSA (Figure 2d-I) and PMHS/TiO2 (Figure 2d-II).
The spectra show the common elements in each of the two thin films,
which include C, Ti, O, and Si. The element Co, in particular, can
only be detected in the EDS spectra of PMHS/TiO2@CoSA,
confirming the existence of CoSA in this superhydrophobic nanocomposite
film. The atomic composition of the coating is found to be C/O/Si/Ti/Co
= 25.7:54.1:7.9:12.1:0.1, as revealed from the EDS data.

Figure 3a shows
the morphology of the superhydrophobic PMHS/TiO2@CoSA thin
film on the aluminum substrate, as revealed by the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) measurements. PMHS molecules, CoSA sheets (as found
from XRD), and TiO2 nanoparticles (100 nm) have agglomerated
together producing microsized random particles during the sol–gel
and spin-coating processes. The roughness of the thin film is found
to be ∼3.3 μm with a WCA as high as 160°. The hydrophilic
TiO2 nanoparticles covered with a low-surface-energy CoSA
sheet as well as PMHS molecules form binary structures, providing
superhydrophobic as well as UV-protective thin films.

Figure 3b shows
a schematic model of the thin film composed of a core–shell
structure of TiO2@CoSA covered with a PMHS network (PMHS/TiO2@CoSA). The CoSA shell on the TiO2 nanoparticles
stops the photocatalytic reaction of TiO2 with PMHS by
suppressing the movements of the electron–hole pairs generated
from TiO2 because of UV absorption. In the literature,
SiO2 and Al2O3 shells have been used
around TiO2 to stop such reactions to fabricate UV-protective
superhydrophobic thin films.7,27,43 However, it should be pointed out that the adoption of the hydrophilic
SiO2 shell around the hydrophilic TiO2 nanoparticles
would increase the risk of producing hydrophilic surfaces rather than
the superhydrophobic ones. In our case, the naturally hydrophobic
CoSA shell covering the cores of the TiO2 nanoparticles
not only improved the hydrophobic properties of the nanocomposite
surfaces but also inhibited the photoinduced degradation by TiO2 nanoparticles, providing a dual protection against UV degradation
as well as water adhesion. As a result, the hydrophobic PMHS matrix
will not be decomposed by the photoinduced degradation reactions of
TiO2. Therefore, the superhydrophobic nanocomposite thin
films fabricated with a TiO2@CoSA core–shell structure
embedded in the hydrophobic PMHS matrix sustain UV irradiation while
exhibiting and maintaining their superhydrophobic properties.

In the literature, few works have been reported on the simultaneous
UV degradation study of the nanoparticles dispersed in the liquid
of methylene blue (MB) or rhodamine B (RhB) as well as UV degradation
in the thin films.20,21 For instance, in a work by Xu
et al.,20 an organically modified silica
(ormosil) aerogel with a high surface area and high porosity was loaded
with TiO2 nanocrystals to synthesize TiO2–SiO2 nanocomposites. Both ormosil and TiO2–SiO2 nanocomposites show superhydrophobic properties when coated
on fabric surfaces. The authors further studied the photocatalytic
performance of the TiO2–SiO2 composite
particles and observed decolorization of RhB diluted in water.20 It is interesting to note that these catalyst
nanoparticles are more UV active when they are dispersed in the MB
or RhB solutions than that in the form of a solid in the thin films.
Although the decolorization of RhB was due to photocatalytic reactions
of TiO2–SiO2 nanocomposites under UV
radiation, the coatings on fabrics remained superhydrophobic after
UV radiation.20 Similarly, PDMS-coated
SiO2 and N-TiO2 were used by Lee et al.21 to prepare UV-resistive superhydrophobic coatings.
They reported that nearly 50:50 mixture of PDMS-coated SiO2 and N-TiO2 provided a film with stable superhydrophobicity;
however, it suffered the maximum photocatalytic activity when dispersed
in the MB solutions, degrading upon exposure to UV.

In the present
case, we have shown that our coatings retain their
superhydrophobic properties even after more than 300 h of UV exposure,
which is much longer than those of other works reported previously.6,16,18−21,24 Further work is in progress to understand the UV degradation mechanism
of MB or RhB by our newly developed core–shell CoSA@TiO2 (TiO2 in the core) nanoparticles in the liquid
as found in the literature.20,21

Conclusions
CoSA
thin films have been prepared and characterized by XRD, ATR–FTIR,
and UV–vis spectroscopy. The synthesized CoSA has been utilized
to prepare a UV-durable superhydrophobic nanocomposite thin film by
embedding TiO2 nanoparticles in a hydrophobic PMHS matrix
on AA6061 aluminum substrates. This PMHS/TiO2@CoSA superhydrophobic
thin film exhibited a nearly constant WCA of 160° under continuous
UV irradiation for 1 month, whereas the superhydrophobic PMHS/TiO2 thin films, without CoSA shells on TiO2 nanoparticles,
were drastically converted to the superhydrophilic state after UV
irradiation of only 4 h. The synthesized CoSA not only increased the
hydrophobicity in the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles but
also confined the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2. The
UV durability mechanism of the superhydrophobic TiO2 thin
films has been explained using a reasonable schematic model. These
UV-durable superhydrophobic thin films formed by incorporating TiO2@CoSA nanoparticles have potential to be utilized in a wide
range of practical applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Reagents
An AA6061-T6 aluminum alloy
with a chemical composition of Al 97.9 wt %, Mg 1.08 wt %, Si 0.63
wt %, Mn 0.52 wt %, Cu 0.32 wt %, Fe 0.17 wt %, Ti 0.02 wt %, and
V 0.01 wt % has been used as substrates for coating. The aluminum
(AA6061 alloy) substrates of dimension 1″ × 1″
were ultrasonically degreased in a soap solution and cleaned in ethanol
and deionized water for 30 min each. The ultrasonically cleaned aluminum
samples were dried for 24 h at 70 °C before further coating processes.
The reagents including PMHS, cobalt nitrate, SA, and ammonium hydroxide
were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich. TiO2 nanoparticles (average
particle size: 100 nm) were purchased from MKnano. All of the reagents
were of analytical grade. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2
MΩ·cm was used in all of the experiments.

Preparation
of PMHS/TiO2 Sol
In the first
beaker, a mixture was prepared using 2 mL of PMHS and 40 mL of ethanol.
Similarly, in the second beaker separately, 3 mL of ammonium hydroxide
(28 wt %) was diluted in 10 mL of ethanol. This diluted ammonium hydroxide
solution was added drop by drop into the first beaker to make the
sol of PMHS. The prepared PMHS sol was aged for 48 h at room temperature
while stirring continuously using a magnetic Teflon stirrer. In the
third beaker, 1.5 g of anatase TiO2 nanoparticle was dispersed
in 50 mL of ethanol, by ultrasonication for an hour. In the same beaker,
25 mL of PMHS aged sol was added drop by drop while constantly stirring
to prepare the sol of TiO2/PMHS. This mixed solution was
further aged for 5 days at room temperature while being constantly
stirred prior to spin-coating on clean aluminum surfaces.

Preparation
of CoSA
CoSA was prepared using 17 mL of
cobalt nitrate (0.01 M) and 34 mL of SA (0.01 M) ethanolic solution
as well as 150 μL of ammonia (28 wt %) catalytic solution; the
mixture was stirred overnight.

Preparation of PMHS/TiO2@CoSA Sol–Gel
Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles
(1.5 g) were dispersed in 51
mL of ethanolic CoSA solution prepared as above. Further, 25 mL of
PMHS aged sol as prepared above was added drop by drop while constantly
stirring to prepare the sol of TiO2@CoSA–PMHS. This
mixture was also aged further similar to the PMHS/TiO2 sol
for 5 days at room temperature prior to spin-coating on clean aluminum
surfaces.

Spin-Coating Process
The spin-coating process was carried
out using a Single Wafer Spin Processor (Laurell Technologies WS-650SZ-6NPP/LITE)
to prepare thin films from PMHS/TiO2 and PMHS/TiO2@CoSA sol.

UV Degradation Process
A UV degradation
chamber developed
in-house, composed of two UV lights with wavelengths of 302 and 365
nm, was used to study the UV degradation process of the coated thin
films.

Characterization
The morphological and elemental analyses
of the thin films prepared by the spin-coating process were performed
using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6480LV) equipped with
an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy instrument. The chemical compositional
and structural analyses were carried out using XRD (D8 discover with
a Cu Kα wavelength of 0.154 nm) as well as by ATR–FTIR
(Agilent Technologies Cary 630 FTIR). UV–visible absorption
properties were characterized using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Agilent 8453 UV–visible Spectroscopy System). The surface
wettability investigations of the coated samples were conducted by
measuring static and dynamic CAs of a 10 μL water drop using
a First Ten Angstrom CA goniometer. The dynamic WCA was measured by
holding the water drop with a stationary needle in contact with the
sample surface and moving the goniometer stage in one direction. The
CAH, which is the difference between the advanced and receding CAs,
was measured as described in previous reports.3,36,44,45 The roughness
measurements were carried out using the MicroXAM-100-HR 3D surface
profilometer.
