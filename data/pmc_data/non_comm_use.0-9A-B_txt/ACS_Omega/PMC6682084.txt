The three lowest full three-dimensional
adiabatic and three diabatic
global potential energy surfaces are reported for the title system.
The accurate ab initio method (MCSCF/MRCI) with larger basis sets
(aug-cc-pVQZ) is used to reduce the adiabatic potential energies,
and the global adiabatic potential energy surfaces are deduced by
a three-dimensional B-spline fitting method. The conical intersections
and the mixing angles between the lowest three adiabatic potential
energy surfaces are precisely studied. The most possible nonadiabatic
reaction pathways are predicted, i.e., N(2D) + H2(X1∑g+) → NH2(22A′) →
CI (12A′–22A′) →
NH2(12A′) → CI (12A″–12A′) → NH2(12A″)
→ NH(X3∑–) + H(2S). The products of the first excited state (NH(a1Δ)
+ H(2S)) and the second excited state (NH(b1∑g+)
+ H(2S)) can be generated in these nonadiabatic reaction
pathways too.

1 Introduction
Reactions
between atomic nitrogen and molecule are of great interest
in atmospheric chemistry and combustion processes.1 The three lowest adiabatic electronic states (labeled 12A″/12B1, 12A′/12A1, and 22A′/12B2 in the Cs/C2v symmetry, respectively)
of NH2 have been studied quite extensively over a number
of years by various experimental2−5 and theoretical techniques.6−34 Jungen and co-workers6 obtained an accurate
potential energy surface for X2B1 and A2A1 states of NH2 in 1980. Carter and
Handy7 generated three-dimensional (3D)
potential energy functions of the A2A1–X2B1 bent–bent Renner–Teller system
of NH2. Alijah and Duxbury8,9 used the stretch–bender
approach method to study the rovibronic energies for the ground state
of NH2, and the Renner–Teller and spin–orbit
interactions between the A2A1 and the X2B1 states of NH2. The global potential
energy surface (GPES) for 1A″ has been careful studied by Pederson
and co-workers.15 In this work, the authors
found a saddle point energy of 2.3 kcal/mol for the perpendicular
approach of the second-order configuration interaction surfaces, and
got the collinear stationary point energy of 5.5 kcal/mol. Another
GPES24 for the ground state of NH2(X2A″) has been constructed by three-dimensional
cubic spline interpolation method, and the vibrational frequencies
of NH2 and its isotopomers were calculated. The NH2(12A′) GPES has been presented by Pederson
et al.,16 and the nonadiabatic quasiclassical
trajectory calculations were performed. This work obtained the different
products of the ground-state NH and the excited-state NH(a1Δ). The NH2(12A′) GPES and the
NH2(22A′) GPES have been accurately calculated
by Li and Varandas26,28 with single-sheeted double many-body
expansion method. The 22A″/22B1 state of NH2 is also well studied by Li and co-workers.35

Most of these works have studied the potential
energy surfaces
(PESs) for the ground and the first two excited states. Although the
title reaction process mostly occurs in the ground state, nonadiabatic
interactions with excited electronic states may also play an important
role.36 It is well-known that the diabatic
potential energy surfaces can be used for modeling electronically
nonadiabatic processes.37−41

In quantum chemistry, conical intersections (CIs) between
two potential
energy surfaces are very important because the potential energy surfaces
are degenerated, the Born–Oppenheimer approximation breaks
down, and the nonadiabatic processes can occur here. Therefore, the
location and characterization of the geometry of the CIs are essential
in explaining the nonadiabatic events. CIs play a very important role
in nonradiative de-excitation transitions from an excited electronic
state to a ground electronic state of the molecules.42

Up to now, no accurate diabatic PES exists for nonadiabatic
study
for NH2. The major goal of the present work is to report
an accurate global diabatic PES including the ground and the first
two excited states of NH2 based on the MCSCF/MRCI calculation
method. First, the lowest three adiabatic PESs are calculated. Second,
the mixing angles, which are used to transform the adiabatic PESs
to diabatic PES, are fitted. Third, CIs, which are between two adjacent
PESs, are accurately studied.

This paper is organized as follows:
the next section outlines the
theory for calculating the potential energies and mixing angles. The
adiabatic potential, CIs, and diabatic potential results are presented
and discussed in the third section. A simple summary is given in the
last section.

2 Computational Methods
2.1 Adiabatic Potential Energies Calculation
All ab initio
calculations have been carried out at the MCSCF/MRCI
level with the MOLPRO 2012 package43 using
the large basis sets (aug-cc-pVQZ) of Dunning.44 This involves 9 electrons in 1 closed orbital (1A′
+ 0A″), 6 active orbitals (5A′ + 1A″), and 165
external orbitals (104A′ + 61A″). Similar to our earlier
works,45−48 we calculated the three lowest states in atom–diatom (N–HH)
Jacobi coordinate (r(H–H), R(N–HH), and θ) (see Figure 1). For θ = 0.0–40.0°, the
angle grid is 5.0°. In this range, r is calculated
from 0.4 to 12.0 Å with 72 points and R is calculated
from 0.0 to 18.0 Å with 107 points in different step sizes. Therefore,
61 633 geometries are generated for each state. For θ
= 40.0–90.0°, the angle grid is 10°. In this range, r is calculated from 0.4 to 5.0 Å using 37 points and R is calculated from 0.0 to 18.0 Å using 77 points.
Therefore, 17 094 geometries are generated in this range. A
total of 78 727 geometries are calculated for each state. The
PESs, which are fitted using this range and large number points, are
accurate for further study. Inside the whole scan field, the procedures
interpolate the surfaces are made using the three dimension B-spline method.49,50

coordinate.

2.2 Mixing
Angles (α) Calculation
It is generally known that the
nonadiabatic coupling terms and the
avoided crossing point between two adiabatic PESs can be well-calculated
in one-dimensional (1D) coordinate;51−53 the mixing angles are
predicted in the same method in the present work. The details are
shown as follows. The mixing angles (α) between states (12A″, 12A′, and 22A′)
are calculated using the corresponding adiabatic potential energies.
The details for calculating the α12 between E1 and E2 is as follows.
First, r and θ values are fixed and then the potential energies E1 and E2 are calculated with the
function R and the derivatives of dE1/dR and dE2/dR. Second, a point where dE1/dR = dE2/dR is found
and the mixing angle α = 45.0° is assigned, which is the
crossing point of the two diabatic potential energy surfaces. Third,
tangents are made from the crossing point to the adiabatic curves
and then α is set at 90.0 and 0.0°. Finally, the other
values of α are fitted between these two points. Using the same
method, the α23 between the states of 12A′ and 22A′ can be achieved. After calculating
all α12 and α23 at the needed range
of r and θ, the global three-dimensional (3D)
mixing angles can be derived by 3D-B-spline method.

2.3 Adiabatic-to-Diabatic Transformation
Considering three
coupling states of NH2, the diabatic
energies Hiid can be obtained in terms of our fitted adiabatic energies Eia as
follows:

when α12 is larger than 45.0°,
the diabatic energies H11d can be calculated using eq 1. 1  when α12 is less than 45.0°
and larger than 0°, the diabatic energies H11d can be calculated
using eqs 2 and 3. 2   3  The second and the third diabatic potential
energies can be calculated using eqs 4 and 5. 4   5  The coupling potential energies
between two
diabatic states are shown as follows 6   7   8   9   10   11  

3 Results and Discussion
The adiabatic potential energies of the lowest three states of
the NH2 system are calculated and transformed to the lowest
three diabatic potential energies. For the ease of discussion of these
PESs, the lowest state energy of N(2D) + H2(X1∑g+) is shifted to 0.000 eV.

3.1 Two-Dimensional Adiabatic
Potential Energy
Surfaces
To clearly show the change of potential energy as
a function of R and r, the two-dimensional
ground-state adiabatic potential energy surfaces (2D-PESs) of NH2 are plotted in Figures 2–5 for θ = 0.0,
30.0, 60.0, and 90.0°, respectively. The upper part of each figure
is 2D-PES, and the lower part is the contour plot of the corresponding
2D-PES. The difference of energy between two adjacent curves is 0.20
eV in the contour plot parts, and short distance between two adjacent
curves corresponds to big energy changes with distance (R or r) and vice verse.

Figure 2 Adiabatic potential energy
surface (in eV) and contour plots of
the potential energy surface for the ground state of NH2 as a function of distances r and R (in Å) in C∞ symmetry.

From Figure 2, one
can see that with the decrease in the distance R,
the potential energies increase. There is no minimum for these linear
geometries, but there exists a transition state. The energy of this
transition state is nearly 0.663 eV (r = 1.08 Å, R = 1.65 Å). After crossing this transition state,
the system can reach its product part. Figure 3 shows the adiabatic potential energy surface
for the ground state of NH2 with the angle θ = 30.0°.
The character of this figure is similar to the linear symmetry: first,
with the decrease in the distance between the atom N and the molecule
H2, the potential energy is increased; second, after the
transition (the energy of this transition state is 0.533 eV), the
system will reach its product part. The different character of this
figure is that after the transition state, whose energy is 0.225 eV,
there is a shallow minimum in this figure. The minimum energy is 0.134
eV. Similar to our earlier work,47 this
is not a real minimum; if this geometry is optimized, the C2v symmetry geometry will be
obtained, which has been frequently pointed out by Poveda and Varandas.54

Figure 3 Adiabatic potential energy surface (in eV) and its contour
plots
for the ground state of NH2 as a function of distances r and R (in Å) at an angle θ
= 30.0° in the Jacobi coordinate.

The 2D-PES and its contour plot for θ = 60.0°
is shown
in Figure 4. From this
figure, one can know that when the N atom attacks the H2 molecule along the angle θ = 60.0°, the energies are
increased with decrease in the distance R; after
crossing this transition state (the energy of this transition state
is 0.145 eV), the system will reach its first minimum. The energy
of this minimum is −0.415 eV. After this minimum, the lowest
potential energy reaction pathway will cross another transition state
(the energy of this transition state is 0.265 eV) and then will reach
its product part.

Figure 4 Adiabatic potential energy surface (in eV) and its contour
plots
for the ground state of NH2 as a function of distances r and R (in Å) at angle θ =
60.0° in the Jacobi coordinate.

The 2D-PES of θ = 90.0° is shown in Figure 5. Similar to the HN2 system,54 there are two minima and two transition states in this
figure. When using the N atom to attack H2 molecule along
the θ = 90.0°, the system should overcome 0.117 eV energy
to reach the first minimum, whose potential energy is −0.962
eV (R = 1.06 Å, r = 0.96 Å);
then, the ground-state system crossing the second transition state reaches
the global minimum. The energy of the global minimum is −4.022
eV, which is 5.154 eV lower than that of the reactants of N(2D) + H2, which is in good agreement with the results of
Qu et al.17 (5.47 eV). The geometry of
this minimum is R = 0.32 Å and r = 1.88 Å.

Figure 5 Adiabatic potential energy surface (in eV) and its contour
plots
for the ground state of NH2 as a function of distances r and R (in Å) in the C2v symmetry.

Comparing the energy of the minima of θ = 0.0, 30.0,
60.0,
and 90.0°, we can reach the conclusion that the minimum with
the C2v symmetry is the
global minimum. The detailed information is given in Figure 6.

state are plotted in Figure S1–S6 (see the Supporting Information).

3.2 Three-Dimensional
Diabatic Potential Energy
Surfaces
3.2.1 Conical Intersections (CIs)
The
CIs between two potential energy surfaces, where the nonadiabatic
reaction processes take place, are very important. To clearly understand
the nonadiabatic event of the NH2 system, the geometries
of CI1 for 12A″–12A′,
and CI2 12A′–22A′
states are optimized using the CASSCF method with 6-311G(d,p) basis
set. The optimized structures are shown in Figure 7. The left panel of Figure 7 shows the CI1 geometry. The figure
shows that the geometry of this conical intersection is C2v symmetry, the bond length of the two
H atoms is stretched to 1.304 Å, and R(N–HH)
is 0.989 Å. For ease of understanding the change of these two
potential energy surfaces near the CI1 part, the 2D-PESs
of the ground state (12A″) and the first excited
state (12A′) are plotted in Figure 8. In this figure, the geometry of the avoid
crossing point for these two adiabatic PESs is R =
0.906 Å and r = 1.192 Å, the corresponding
adiabatic energies are E1 = −0.681
eV and E2 = −0.583 eV, the difference
of energy for these two states is 0.098 eV. The geometry of CI2 are plotted in the right panel of Figure 7 and the 2D-PESs near CI2 are
plotted in Figure 9. The geometry of CI2 is different from CI1. CI2 is near the product part, the data of this geometry
are r = 1.693 Å, R = 1.153
Å, and θ is nearly 60.0°. The avoid crossing part
for these two adiabatic states is in good agreement with the optimized
geometry; our results are R = 1.202 Å and r = 1.808 Å, and the potential energies are E2 = 1.434 eV and E3 = 1.439 eV, with the difference between these two energies being
0.005 eV. Because the energies of these two conical intersections
are not too high, these two conical intersections may play an important
role in the title reaction.

basis set using MOLPRO program, for the 12A″–12A′ and 12A′–22A′
states of NH2.

Figure 9 Adiabatic PESs for the states of 12A′
and 22A′ of NH2 near the conical intersection
area with the function of R and r (in Å), the angle is fixed at θ = 60.0°.

Taking into account all of the adiabatic PESs and
CIs, the nonadiabatic
reaction pathways can be speculated. Figure 10 shows the most possible nonadiabatic reaction
pathways for the title system. For N(2D) + H2(X1∑g+) reaction, the system can form the NH2(22A′) isomers, a part of these isomers will separate and generate
the second excited state products (NH(b1∑g+) + H(2S)). The energy of the second excited state products is slightly
higher than that of the reactants. The other part of the second excited
state isomers can pass CI1 to transfer to the first excited
state isomers. The energy of CI1 is nearly equal to that
of the isomer (NH2(22A′)), so the transformation
is quite easy. Some part of these first excited state isomers can
separate to the first excited state products (NH(a1Δ)
+ H(2S)); the others may cross CI2 to transfer
the isomers of the ground state; at last, the isomers of the ground
state can lead to the ground-state products (NH(X3∑–) + H(2S)). The reverse reaction can also
occur simultaneously in these reaction pathways. It should be pointed
out that the main aim of Figure 10 is to show the nonadiabatic process, so the complexes
and the transition states for the title system are not included in
this figure.

3.2.2 Diabatic Potential
Using formulas 1–11, the global diabatic potentials can be derived.
To clearly show the most important part of the diabatic potentials,
the 1D adiabatic and diabatic potential near the CI points are plotted
in Figures 11 and 12, and the enlarged avoid crossing parts are plotted
in the same figure. To ensure that the diabatic PESs are accurate,
atomic units are chosen to show these potential energy surfaces. Figure 11 shows the three
lowest adiabatic energies (E1, E2, and E3), diabatic
energies (H11, H22, and H33), and nondiagonal elements
(H12 and H23) in the function of R values with the angle fixed
at θ = 90.0° and r = 1.30 Å. For
the adiabatic potential energy surfaces, there are three avoid crossing
points in this figure. The first one lies between the ground-state
PES and the first excited-state PES. The geometry of the CI point
is similar to the minimum of the first excited state. The energy of
this CI is nearly −0.6 eV, meaning that the electrons easily
hop between the ground state and the first excited state. There are
two adiabatic avoid crossing points between the first excited state
and the second excited state. The crossing geometry of the diabatic
PES, R, is nearly equal to 1.27 Å, and the potential
energy is nearly −55.53 au for the first adiabatic avoid crossing
point. The R value is nearly 0.5 Å for the second
diabatic crossing point; the energy (near −55.39 au) of this
point is higher than that of the previous one (−55.53 au).
The energies of these two avoid crossing points are higher than that
of the conical intersection between these two excited states, so they
are not the main surface hopping part. Figure 12 shows the lowest three adiabatic potential
energies and the corresponding diabatic potential energies near the
conical intersection between the first excited state and the second
excited state. This figure shows that near the CI point, the difference
in the energy between the first excited state and the second excited
state is very small, and the geometry of the CI point is close to
the minimum geometry of the second excited state. On this condition,
the electrons hop easily between these two states. In other words,
from this CI point, the NH2 system is easily transformed
between 12A′ and 22A′ states.
There is a second crossing part between the first excited state and
the second excited state; the R value for this diabatic
energy crossing part is nearly 0.5 Å, but the energy of this
crossing point is much higher than that of the first crossing point,
which is not important for this system. In this figure, there is crossing
point between diabatic energies H11 and H22; however, since the energy difference between
these two states is large, this is not the main surface hopping part.
From Figures 11 and 12, we could find that the diabatic PESs are very
smooth even near the crossing part. And near the crossing part, the
nondiagonal elements H12 and H23 are large and other parts are zero.

and the nondiagonal elements (panel B: H12 and panel A: H23) (in au) as the function
of R (in Å) with
fixed θ = 90.0° and r = 1.30 Å. The
crossing part of every two diabatic PESs are enlarged plotted in this
figure.

elements (panel C: H12 and panels A and
B: H23) (in au) as the function of R (in Å)
with fixed θ = 60.0° and r = 1.70 Å.
The most important crossing part of every two diabatic PES is enlarged
plotted in this figure.

What should we point out here is that these diabatic potential
energies only considered three adiabatic potential energies; if more
adiabatic potential energy surfaces were considered, the diabatic
energy of H11 would have been much higher
with the increase of the R value; there should be
no transition state point in Figure 11.

Because the angles of CI1 and CI2 are 60.0
and 90.0°, the 2D diabatic PESs are plotted at angles 60.0 and
90.0°, respectively. The details are shown in Figures 3–7. Figures 13 and 14 show the diabatic PESs of H11, H22, and H33 with fixed θ = 90.0° near the CI point of
the ground state and the first excited state. Figure 15 shows the different diabatic potential
energy between H11−H22 and H11−H33. Figures 16 and 17 show the diabatic PESs
of H11, H22, and H33 with fixed θ = 60.0°
near the CI point of the first excited state and the second excited
state. These four figures show that the diabatic PESs of each state
are very smooth; the diabatic crossing points are nearly in the same
line for each two diabatic PESs (see Figure 15).

4 Conclusions
The three lowest electronic adiabatic state PESs have been reported
for NH2 on the B-spline fit method for the ab initio MCSCF/MRCI
energies calculated using AVQZ basis sets. The conical intersections
between the ground state and the first excited state and between the
first excited state and the second excited state have been accurately
studied using MOLPRO program. The mixing angles, which can be used
to calculate the diabatic PESs with adiabatic PESs, have been precisely
studied in the present work. The three diabatic PESs of H11, H22, H33 and the coupling potential energies between every two
diabatic states have been calculated and discussed carefully. After
carefully studying the adiabatic PESs, CIs, and diabatic PESs, the authors make a conclusion
that if the title reaction starts with the second excited state, some
part of the reactant can reach the second excited state products,
and the other part of the system should cross CI1, the
electrons hopping from the second excited state to the first excited
state, then form the isomer in the first excited state. The same with
the second excited state, some of the first excited state isomer can separate
to the first excited state products, and the others may get the enough
energy then it can pass CI2, the electrons can hop to the
ground state, the isomer on the ground state can be formed, at last,
the ground state NH(X3∑–) + H(2S) products can be obtained. A full dynamic study of these
global diabatic potential energy surfaces can be used to prove this
speculation.
