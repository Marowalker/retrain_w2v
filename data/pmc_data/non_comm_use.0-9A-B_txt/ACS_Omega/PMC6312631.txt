Aluminum (Al) is one of the most widely
used metals for industry and household applications, but its longevity
is limited by its tendency for corrosion. In this work, we report
a facile method to fabricate superhydrophobic Al surfaces that have
excellent anti-corrosion effect. The surface is obtained by etching
Al in CuCl2 solution to form the micro–nano-pit
surface texture followed by lowering its surface energy in an aqueous
ethanol solution of stearic acid. The superhydrophobic Al surfaces
show water contact angles as high as 165°. Electrochemical tests
demonstrate that the corrosion rate of the Al surface drops by 94.5%
after the superhydrophobic modification (corrosion current density
lowers from 1.11 × 10–4 to 6.10 × 10–6 A cm–2). We also show that the
superhydrophobic surface will protect the Al from corrosion even under
a very harsh environment. In addition, our method is scalable and
the superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit excellent flexible and reparable
properties. This anti-corrosive superhydrophobic Al surface will prolong
Al in its broad usage.

Introduction
Throughout
the long-term evolution in nature, many organisms developed
various characteristics with amazing properties. For instance, one
such property is the superhydrophobicity of lotus leaves and water
strider legs, which describes the nonwetting characteristics of material
surfaces.1−3 A superhydrophobic
surface, normally defined as a surface with a water contact angle
(an angle that a liquid makes with a solid) larger than 150°,
repels water to form near spherical shapes that do not adhere to them
but instead bounce off, which has attracted intensive attention because
of its excellent prospects in the fields of self-cleaning, anti-icing,
anti-corrosion, and microfluidic devices.4−14 As a light
metal, aluminum (Al) has widely used in general industry as well as
in household activities thanks to its excellent heat and electrical
conductivities, natural availability, and high mechanical properties.15 However, these applications are seriously limited
because of the easy corrosion or deterioration of Al surfaces. With
the extensive nano- and micro-scale surface textures and a layer of
air trapped among these structures, a superhydrophobic layer can repel
the water and moisture from the surface, which results in a dry and
clean surface.4,16 Consequently, superhydrophobic
surfaces can slow down the corrosion or deterioration process on metal
surfaces.7,8,17 It is therefore
highly desirable to create a protective superhydrophobic Al surface
with large area by facile and cost-effective approaches. In this work,
we report an easy method to produce superhydrophobic Al surfaces by
etching in CuCl2 solution to form micro–nano-pit
surface textures followed by lowering its surface energy in an aqueous
ethanol solution of stearic acid. The fabricated superhydrophobic
Al surfaces exhibit excellent properties of anticorrosion, flexibility,
and reparability, which have significance to prolong Al materials
in its broad usage.

Experimental Section
Al foils (Goodfellow, USA), copper(II) chloride (98%, Alfa Aesar),
stearic acid (98%, Alfa Aesar), ethanol (absolute for analysis, Emsure,
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), sodium chloride (99%, Alfa Aesar),
and acetone (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) were used for preparation of the superhydrophobic
Al surfaces and characterization of the surface properties.

Al foils with the thickness of ∼0.2 mm were degreased in acetone
and ethanol by using the ultrasonic method, and cleaned with deionized
(DI) water. Then the cleaned Al foils were immersed in CuCl2 solution (5%) to carry out the etching process. The etching process
was stopped when the surface of the Al foil was totally etched (e.g.,
for an Al foil with a size of about 5 cm2 in 150 mL CuCl2 solution, the suitable etching time is about 5 min). During
the etching process, ultrasonic was also used to remove the Cu particles
aggregated on the Al foils. After the etching process, Al foils were
first rinsed with DI water and then ultrasounded with acetone for
10 min to remove the Cu particles finally. Al foils without Cu particles
were dried by using nitrogen and immersed in an aqueous ethanol solution
of stearic acid (0.01 M) for 10 min. After that, samples are rinsed
by pure ethanol and kept in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h, and cold
in air for using.

Contact angle measurements were done by using
a drop-shape analyzer (Sl200KB, Kino, USA) with a droplet of distilled
water having a drop volume of 0.2 μL. The experiments were repeated
at five different points on each sample and the average values are
calculated. Surface morphologies of samples were examined using scanning
electron microscopy (Zeiss-Auriga Germany) and a confocal UV scanning
laser microscope (KEYENCE, VK-9700).

To characterize anticorrosion
property, the electrochemical measurements were performed by an electrochemical
workstation (CHI 680) in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution at the room temperature.
The measurements were conducted in a three-electrode cell with a Ag/AgCl
reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode. The sample with
an exposed area of 1 cm × 1 cm serves as the work electrode.
Before the electrochemical measurements, all the samples were immersed
in the 3.5 wt % NaCl solution for 60 min to obtain a stable open circuit
potential (OCP). Polarization curves were obtained for untreated and
superhydrophobic Al surfaces by using a scan rate of 1 mV/s in the
range of ±100 mV versus the OCP.

Results and Discussion
The Al superhydrophobic surfaces
are synthesized by two steps: first roughing the surface of a cleaned
Al foil by chemical etching in CuCl2 solution (5%), and
then lowering the surface energy of the roughed Al foil by immersing
into an aqueous ethanol solution of stearic acid (0.01 M). Detailed
fabrication processes are described in the experimental part. Figure 1a,b shows the scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images with sample photos (insets) of Al
surfaces before and after CuCl2 etching. As can be seen,
the chemical etching totally changes the morphologies of Al surfaces,
which results in micro–nano-pits on the surface of the Al foil.
More SEM images with a large area or high magnification are shown
in Supporting Information Figure S1. The
cross section of laser microscope shown in Figure
S2 demonstrate that the height of the micro–nano-pits
variates to about 40 μm. The confocal UV laser microscope image
of the three-dimensional surface profile can be found in Figure S3. These structures are essential for
superhydrophobicity. Without the surface roughness, water static contact
angles on the Al surface before and after stearic acid modification
are only about 48° and 90°, respectively, as shown in Figure 1c,d. Surface modification
by stearic acid solution does not change the morphologies of Al foils,
as shown in Figure S4. However, this modification
is also very important to obtain the superhydrophobicity. The roughed
Al surface without the chemical modification of stearic acid solution
is totally hydrophilic. As shown in Figure 1e, water drops disperse immediately on the
roughed Al surface upon impact, which makes it difficult to measure
the static contact angle. After stearic acid modification on the rough
Al surface, water static contact angle is found to be about 165°,
as shown in Figure 1f. Surface modification to lower the surface energy with stearic
acid solution results in the formation of a sponge-like layer on the
roughed Al surface due to the process of a carboxyl group that reacts
with the Al atom through the following dehydration process:  

Figure 1 SEM images and sample photos (insets) of Al surfaces before
(a) and after (b) CuCl2 etching. Contact angle measurement
of the Al surface without surface roughness before (c) and after (d)
stearic acid modification, and Al surface with surface roughness before
(e) and after (f) stearic acid modification.

Bonding of the long nonpositive end
of the alkyl to the roughed Al surface creates a low energy surface,
which results in the final superhydrophobic property.15,18 This dehydration process is confirmed by our infrared spectra shown
in Figure S5. The roll-off angles for the
superhydrophobic surfaces are measured, which are less than 5°.
Because of the excellent superhydrophobicity, when a drop of water
is released and falls toward the superhydrophobic Al surface, the
water droplet is repelled by the Al surface to such a degree that
it bounces off the surface, lands again due to gravity, and bounces
again and off the surface, as shown in Supporting
Information Movie S1. Top- and side-view photos of a water
drop locates on the surface of our prepared superhydrophobic Al foil
are shown in Figure S6, which is very similar
as a water drop on lotus leaves.

For the roughed Al surfaces
after modification by stearic acid solution, water droplets could
maintain a spherical shape on such surfaces with a water static contact
angle of about 165° (Figure 1f). The droplets are repelled by the modified Al surface,
and could roll off with a very small angle (Movie S1). Therefore, the Al surface exhibits superhydrophobicity
and ultralow adhesion to water droplets. The cooperation between the
etching-induced roughness and the low-surface-energy stearic acid
layer effectively inhibits the contact between the water droplet and
the hierarchical micro- and nano-scale surface. The water droplet
is at the Cassie–Baxter contact state.6,7 The
water droplet looks like being lifted by the hierarchical micro–nano-structures
and touches just the top part of the structures. Therefore, the small
contact area between the hierarchical structure and the water droplet
leads to the superhydrophobicity of such roughed Al surfaces.

To check the mechanical durability of our superhydrophobic Al surfaces,
we carried out the experiment of mechanical abrasion by using sandpaper
(grit no. 400). As show in Figure S7, in
one abrasion cycle, the Al surface with a weight of 50 g was placed
face-down to a sandpaper and moved for 10 cm along the ruler; and
then the sample was rotated by 90° (face to the sandpaper) and
moved for 10 cm along the ruler, which guarantees the surface is abraded
longitudinally and transversely in each cycle. Our experiment shows
that the Al surface can withstand at least 30 cycles of this sandpaper
abrasion, which confirmed that the superhydrophobic Al surface has
good mechanical durability to some extent.

In order to estimate
the anti-corrosion property, Tafel plots were measured for untreated
Al surface and superhydrophobic Al surface when the stable OCP was
obtained after the samples being immersed into NaCl solution (3.5
wt %) for at least 1 h.7,8 The measured Tafel plots are shown
in Figure 2. On the
basis of electrochemical kinetics of corrosion, the corrosion potential
(Ecorr) and corrosion current density
(Icorr) can be obtained by the extrapolation
method in this polarization (Tafel) plots.9,19−21 The ordinate
and the abscissa of the intersection of anodic slope (βa) and the cathodic slope (βc) represented
the Icorr and Ecorr values, respectively, as shown in Figure 2. The fitting slopes of the linear parts
in the Tafel plots at anodic and cathodic branches are βa and βc, as shown in Figure
S8. The values of the Ecorr, Icorr, βa and βc derived from Tafel plots are summarized in Table 1. We can find that the Ecorr and Icorr of the untreated
Al surface are about −1.52 V and 1.11 × 10–4 A cm–2, respectively. In comparison to the untreated
Al surface, the Ecorr and Icorr of the superhydrophobic Al surface reach about −1.38
V and 6.10 × 10–6 A cm–2,
respectively. On the basis of electrochemical kinetics of corrosion,
in such Tafel curves, a more positive Ecorr corresponds to a lower corrosion probability, while the Icorr is a measurement of the corrosion rate
(CR).9,19,20 Therefore,
this result demonstrates that superhydrophobic modification reduces
both the corrosion probability and the CR of the Al surface obviously.
The corrosion performance in our system is further evaluated by the
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) that is a powerful and
complementary electrochemical technique.8Figure 2b is the
EIS spectrum of the untreated Al surface and superhydrophobic Al surface
by immersing in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution. It is well known that a large
Nyquist loop means a low CR.8 The diameter
of the Nyquist loop of the superhydrophobic Al surface is significantly
larger than that of the normal Al surface, which indicates that the
corrosion resistance has been greatly enhanced because of the superhydrophobic
treatment.

plots (b) of the untreated Al surface and superhydrophobic Al surface

Table 1 Corrosion Potential (Ecorr), Corrosion Current Density (Icorr),
Anodic Slope (βa) and Cathodic Slope (βc), CR and the CIE of the Untreated Al Surface and Superhydrophobic
Al Surface
sample	Ecorr (V)	Icorr (A cm–2)	βa (mV/dec)	βc (mV/dec)	CR (mm/year)	CIE (%)	
untreated Al	–1.52	1.11 × 10–4	208.33	156.25	1.2099	0	
superhydrophobic Al	–1.38	6.10 × 10–6	416.67	129.87	0.0665	94.5	
On the basis of the obtained value of Icorr (μA/cm2), we can estimate the CR
according to the following equations  where M is the relative atomic mass of the metal
(g/mol), d is the density of the metal (g/cm3), n is the number of electrons required
to oxidize an atom of the element in the corrosion process, that is,
the valence of the metal, respectively.21,22 Also the corrosion
inhibition efficiency (CIE) can be calculated according to the following
equation  Icorr and Icorr′ are the corrosion current densities before and after superhydrophobic
modification for our Al surface, respectively.7 The calculated values of CR and CIE are also summarized on Table 1. These electrochemical
values demonstrate that the superhydrophobic modification really protects
the surface of Al. The CR drops by 94.5% after the superhydrophobic
surface treatment. The trapped air layer on the superhydrophobic surface
diminishes the contact of water with the substrate interphase, which
results in a barrier for the corrosion ions reaching the Al surface
and corroding the metal.7,8 Furthermore, the trapped
air among the hierarchical micro- and nano-structures could repel
the corrosion ions due to the Laplace pressure.7,8 Therefore,
superhydrophobic modification can slow down the corrosion or deterioration
process in the Al surface.

In order to check the anti-corrosion
property of the Al superhydrophobic surface more directly, we tested
the untreated Al foil and superhydrophobic Al foil under a harsh environment
by using CuCl2 solution (5%) as etching solution. Figure 3a shows the surfaces
of the superhydrophobic and untreated Al foils before the etching
test. Because of the strong diffusion of the roughed surface, the
superhydrophobic Al foil looks much darker than the untreated one.
After etching by CuCl2 solutions with the same volume (4
drops) during the same time (65 s), these two Al foils display a totally
different appearance. As shown in Figure 3b,c, the superhydrophobic Al surface only
shows a very small etched area (the area with light brown color).
By contrast, the untreated Al surface is etched seriously. Brown Cu
particles are found obviously, which come from the etching of CuCl2 solution, as shown in Figure 3c. Detailed etching processes for these two foils can
be seen clearly in supporting formation Movie S2. This experiment demonstrates undoubtedly that our superhydrophobic
Al surface can slow down the corrosion of the Al foil even under a
harsh environment.

Al foil (rectangle
sample at left side) and an untreated Al foil (round sample at right
side) before (a) and after (b) etching by the same CuCl2 solution (5%) for 65 s, and after (c) pouring off the rest of the
etching solution.

Furthermore, our superhydrophobic Al surface
is scalable. As shown in Figure 4a, it is fast and easy to fabricate such surface with
a diameter of 10 cm. In addition, the superhydrophobic Al surfaces
exhibit excellent flexible and repairable properties. As can be seen
in Figure 4, it still
retains the superhydrophobic property after flattening the crumpled
Al foil (Figure 4a–d).
Also the superhydrophobic property on our Al surface can be repaired.
As marked by the red arrows in Figure 4, the sandpaper-abraded areas exhibit obvious hydrophilic
property (Figure 4e,f).
However, this hydrophilic area can easily be repaired to superhydrophobicity
after roughing the surface by CuCl2 solution etching and
then lowering the surface energy by aqueous ethanol solution of stearic
acid, which are described in experimental process and shown in Figure 4g–j. It should
be noted that, during the surface repairing process, the dropped CuCl2 solution only locates on the abraded hydrophilic area, as
other areas are superhydrophobic (Figure 4h). After lowering the surface energy by
dropping stearic acid solution, the superhydrophobic property recovers
on these abraded hydrophilic areas (Figure 4i,j). This selectively repairable ability
should have important significance for the practical application of
superhydrophobic Al surfaces as touching and damaging the surface
is unavoidable in real usage.

areas that are etching by CuCl2 solution; and (i) top-view
and side-view (j) photos of the Al foil with water drops after superhydrophobic
modification again (the repaired areas are marked by red arrows).

Conclusions
In summary, superhydrophobic Al surfaces are fabricated by a simple
approach, first etching in CuCl2 solution to form a micro–nano-pits
surface texture and then lowering its surface energy in an aqueous
ethanol solution of stearic acid. The modified Al surfaces show water
contact angles as high as 165°. Electrochemical tests demonstrate
that the CR of the Al surface drops by 94.5% after these treatments
(corrosion current density lowers from 1.11 × 10–4 to 6.10 × 10–6 A cm–2).
We also show that the superhydrophobic surface will protect the Al
from corrosion even under a very harsh environment. In addition, our
method is scalable and the superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit excellent
flexible and reparable properties. This anti-corrosive superhydrophobic
Al surface will prolong Al in its broad usage.
