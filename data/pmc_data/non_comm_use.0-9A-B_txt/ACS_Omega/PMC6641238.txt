The
interesting redox properties and reactivity of metalloporphycene
have been studied for decades; however, the detailed experimental
investigation on the reactivity and reaction mechanism under inert
condition combined with theoretical calculations had not been performed
so far. In this study, the novel reactivity of the reduced form of
the cobalt porphycene with alkyl halides to form cobalt–carbon
(Co–C) bonds was revealed. Under electrochemical reductive
conditions, not the central cobalt, but the ligand was reduced and
reacted with alkyl halides to afford the cobalt–alkyl complexes
under N2 atmosphere in a glovebox. The reaction mechanism
was clarified by the combination of experimental and theoretical studies
that the porphycene ligand works as a noninnocent ligand and allows
the SN2-type Co–C bond formation. This result provides
us the possibility of the reaction triggered by the reduction of ligand
with macrocyclic π-conjugated system, not by the reduction of
metal.

Introduction
In general, transition-metal
complexes, which work as catalysts
reacting with organohalides, show a catalytic cycle that starts from
the generation of a low-valent metal. Oxidative addition, transmetallation,
and reductive elimination are the significant steps in these catalytic
reactions.1 Especially, electrocatalytic
reactions possess common mechanistic features such that the metal
center accepts electrons from the working electrode by changing to
a lower valence state and become an initiator of the catalytic reaction.
Among them, the cobalt-catalyzed reactions have received increasing
attention because of some advantages. One of the reasons is that cobalt
is inexpensive compared to other transition metals, which show a high
catalytic reactivity such as palladium, rhodium, etc. Another reason
is that the cobalt catalyst is effective for the synthesis of complicated
molecules because the cobalt-catalyzed reaction is a characteristic
reaction with the generation of a radical intermediate by the homolytic
cleavage of the cobalt–carbon (Co–C) bond.2−4 The Co–C bond formation process is the key step and mainly
classified into the following three types by the valence of cobalt:
(1) reaction of Co(I) with alkyl halide,5,6 (2) reaction
of Co(II) with alkyl radical,7,8 and (3) reaction of
Co(III) with nucleophile such as the Grignard reagent.9,10 We also reported the Co–C bond formation reaction using hydrophobic
vitamin B12 derivatives, which was initiated by the reduction
of the cobalt center from Co(II) to the super nucleophilic Co(I).11,12 The reaction mechanisms of these reactions have also got attention.13 Aiming for further improvement, it is necessary
to utilize not only the valence change of the cobalt, but also the
effect of the ligands. Recently, there have been several examples
of the reaction of cobalt complexes with redox-active ligands.14−19 In the case of cobalt(III) bis(amidophenolate), the cobalt center
acts as a strong nucleophile and reacts with alkyl halides under gentle
conditions to generate the Co–C bond without a valence change
in the cobalt ion but with the one-electron oxidations of two amidophenolate
ligands. The reaction mechanism was estimated to be the SN2-type oxidative addition of alkyl halides to the Co(III) center.
The redox-active ligands supply two electrons instead of the cobalt
ion for the formation of the Co–C bond. In this reaction, the
redox-active ligands played the role of an electron donor along with
the reaction sequence.14

As a ligand
of cobalt complex, we focused on porphycene, a tetrapyrrolic
macrocycle and one of the structural isomers of porphyrin, which has
been attracted increasing attention because of its intriguing properties
such as low-energy absorption, small highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap, strong
emission, as well as rich coordination chemistry and its catalytic
activity.20−25 The reduction potential of porphycene is known to be anodically
shifted compared to that of porphyrin due to the splitting of LUMO,
which is degenerate in porphyrin, based on the symmetry lowering from
porphyrin to porphycene (D4h to D2h). Depending
on this positive shift in the reduction potentials, the redox behavior
of the Co(II) complex of porphycene is totally different from that
of porphyrin. In the case of the porphyrin–Co complex, the
one-electron reduction of the Co(II) complex affords the Co(I) complex.6,26 On the other hand, the radical anion of the Co(II) complex is known
to be formed in the case of the porphycene–Co complex (Figure 1).27,28 The unique catalytic reactivity of the porphycene–cobalt
complex was reported for the oxidation of vinyl ether into two corresponding
different acetals under aerobic conditions.29 In this study, the electrochemical experiments of the porphycene–cobalt
complex under anaerobic conditions (in glovebox, O2 <
3 ppm) have been investigated. We found the formation and dissociation
reaction of the Co–C bond via the redox of the noninnocent
porphycene ligand. Although the reactivity of the reduced species
of metalloporphycene has been investigated in several examples, this
study gave information of fundamental reactivity and reaction mechanism
of cobalt porphycene with alkyl halides under inert condition. The
theoretical interpretation of the reaction also provides us the possibility
of the reaction triggered by the reduction of ligand, not by the reduction
of metal, using macrocyclic π-conjugated molecule.

Results and Discussion
The cyclic voltammogram of the cobalt
complex of β-tetra-n-propyl porphycene (Co(II)Pc) in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) exhibited two reversible reduction processes at −0.93
and −1.25 V (vs Ag/AgCl), almost the same values as already
reported (Figure 2a).20,27,28 The time-dependent spectral change
in the UV–vis absorption spectrum was observed under electrochemical
reductive conditions at −1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The generation
of the radical anion of the porphycene–Co(II) complex (Co(II)Pc•–) under reductive
conditions was detected by spectroelectrochemistry in THF. The absorption
peaks at 386 and 610 nm became weaker and new peaks at 731 nm and
longer wavelengths appeared (Figure 2b), indicating that the reduction proceeded not at
the central metal, but at the porphycene ligand, as already reported.27,28 The cyclic voltammogram and absorption spectra of Co(II)Pc in CH2Cl2 without total degassing are also
known to show reversible redox waves and similar spectral changes.20 The radical anion species was also observed
by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement. The ESR spectrum of
the solution obtained from the bulk electrolysis of Co(II)Pc at −1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in THF exhibits many well resolved
hyperfine structures (g = 2.007, A = 0.68 G) (Figure 3). The spectrum is characteristic to that of the one electron reduced
form of metalloporphycene (MPc•–), which displays hyperfine couplings assigned to the four
core nitrogens and the 16 peripheral protons (pyrrole β ×
4, methine bridge × 4, propyl α × 8),20,30,31 indicating the generation of
radical delocalized to the whole porphycene skeleton, thus the observed
species was identified as Co(II)Pc•–. However, when the electrochemical reduction of Co(II)Pc was performed in CH2Cl2 under N2 atmosphere in a glovebox, the electrochemical and spectral changes
were totally different from those of the reaction in THF. Cyclic voltammogram
showed irreversible behavior (Figure 2c) and no bathochromic shift was observed for both
the Soret band and Q band, whereas the intensity of absorption bands
at 592 and 384 nm was slightly decreased and increased, respectively
(Figure 2d). This result
implies that a chemical reaction occurred after the first reduction
step, but there was little change in the macrocyclic conjugation system
of the porphycene ligand before and after the electrolysis. The observed
spectrum after the electrolysis resembled that of the reported porphycene
with the Co–C bond.31,32 To identify the product,
constant potential electrolysis was carried out in CH2Cl2 at −1.20 V (vs Ag/AgCl). CH2Cl2 was removed from the solution after the constant potential electrolysis
under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by washing it
with methanol/water = 2:1. The obtained product was successfully isolated
and characterized by 1H NMR and electron spray ionization
time-of-flight mass spectra (ESI-TOF-MS). Methylene protons of the
axial chloromethyl group were observed at −2.22 ppm because
of the shielding effect due to the ring current of the 18π porphycene
core (Figure 4). This
result indicated that dichloromethane reacted with the reduced porphycene–cobalt
complex and the covalent bond between the cobalt and chloromethyl
group was formed at the axial position of the cobalt.

voltammograms and spectral changes by

data were collected under N2 atmosphere in glovebox. Supporting

Figure 4 1H NMR spectrum of CH2Cl–Co(III)Pc in CDCl3 (* shows
the signal assigned as residual solvent).

By using a similar procedure, the Co–CH3 complex
was prepared by the electrochemical reductive reaction of Co(II)Pc under the CH3I coexisting condition in dimethylformamide
(DMF) and analyzed by 1H NMR and ESI-TOF-MS. The methylated
complex CH3–Co(III)Pc was also successfully afforded and isolated. On the basis of the 1H NMR of CH3–Co(III)Pc in CDCl3, the signal at −5.0 ppm was assigned
as the axial methyl group and the valence of the cobalt could be +3
(Figure 5). Hence,
the formation of the Co–alkyl bond via the electrochemical
reductive reaction of Co(II)Pc was confirmed. Judging
from the spectral change without the appearance of a low-energy absorption
band due to the radical anion in the spectroelectrochemistry and the
irreversible reduction process of Co(II)Pc in CH2Cl2, the reaction between the radical anion ([Co(II)Pc]•–) and alkyl
halides quickly proceeds after the generation of the radical anion
(Scheme 1, Figure 6A). As the intermediate,
small amount of highly nucleophilic Co(I) species could be considered
as one possibility (Figure 6B). If there was a small ratio of electron transfer from the
ligand to cobalt and generated [Co(I)Pc]– was the reactive species, the longer-wavelength absorption
due to dominant inactive [Co(II)Pc]•– should be observed, but no such behavior was observed.

(PBN).

Behavior and Reactivity of Co(II)Pc (a) in THF and (b)
in CH2Cl2
Free-radical migration from the porphycene ligand to the
alkyl
halide followed by the reaction with the Co(II) complex and haloalkyl
radical (Figure 6C)
was also unlikely from the radical-trapping experiment described below.
α-Phenyl-N-tert-butyl-nitron
(PBN) was added as the radical-trapping reagent to the reaction system
including Co(II)Pc and CH3I at −1.2
V (vs Ag/AgCl). Though the reaction was traced by an ESR measurement,
no signal due to the CH3-PBN radical was observed, probably
due to the fast formation of the Co–C bond. Furthermore, the CH3–Co(III)Pc could
be even isolated from the solution containing PBN and characterized
by 1H NMR. However, the ESR signal of the CH3-PBN radical appeared by visible light irradiation after the electrolysis
at −1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 2 h, indicating that the formation
of the Co(III)–C bond under reductive conditions proceeded
without the generation of the methyl radical. Therefore, the pathway
through the Co(II) complex of porphycene radical anion is the most
plausible (Figure 6A), and the homolytic dissociation of the Co(III)–C bond by
light irradiation produces the Co(II) species and methyl radical (Figure 6ii).

We performed
the density functional theory (DFT) calculations for
the detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism. There are two possible
electronic states for the one-electron reduced species of Co(II)Pc; i.e., the metal-reduced species, [Co(I)Pc]–, or the ligand-reduced species, [Co(II)Pc]•–. The energy level of the
former one was estimated to be 21.2 kcal/mol higher than the latter
one, thus the ligand-reduced radical anion species is dominant and
the presence of metal-reduced Co(I) species is negligible (Figure 7). This is consistent
with the experimental result that the reduction occurred not at the
Co center, but at the porphycene ligand. The expected absorption spectrum
from TD-DFT calculation also reproduced the long-wavelength absorption
of the ligand-reduced radical anion species (Supporting Information
(SI), Figure S12). The energy levels of
the MOs, including HOMO-3, derived from the dz2 orbital of Co(II) center increase from ca. −6
to −2 V, along with the reduction of the porphycene ligand
from neutral to the radical anion (SI, Figure S10). From the optimized positional relationship between the [Co(II)Pc]•– and substrate (CH3I) at the first step of the reaction (RC1 in Figure 7), the substrate
approaches from a slightly diagonal position on the ligand, not from
just above the cobalt ion, might be because of the electrostatic interaction
between negatively charged porphycene ligand and slightly positively
charged carbon due to the difference in electronegativity with halogen.
Then, the activated cobalt center reacts with CH3I to afford
a product having the Co–C bond via the SN2-like
transition state (TS1). From the theoretical calculation
of the spin density, the electron spin delocalized to the macrocyclic
conjugation system of the porphycene at first, and partial electron
transfer occurred from both the porphycene ligand and cobalt ion to
CH3I, indicating that the porphycene ligand took the electronic
state between the radical anion and neutral at the transition state
(TS1). More precisely, spin density moved onto the carbon
atom of CH3I from the ligand, and iodine atom, which is
released as a leaving group of the SN2-type reaction, became
negatively charged without the electron spin (Figure 8). On the basis of the result, porphycene
could be thought of as a noninnocent ligand whose reduction initiates
the Co–C bond formation reaction. It is worthy to note that
the reduced part and the reacted part are different. The reduction
occurred at the porphycene ligand, but the following reaction proceeds
at the central cobalt and affords the Co–C bond via TS1. The energy gap between the reaction complexes (RC1) and TS1 was estimated to be 15.0 kcal/mol that is
possible to be surpassed at room temperature. From these results,
it could be concluded that the one-electron reduced species of the
porphycene–Co(II) complex takes the radical anion form, which
is highly reactive to form the Co(III)–C bond by the reaction
with alkyl halides.

and spin density distribution of each reaction step.

The chemical one-electron reduction of the porphycene–cobalt
complex was also performed using decamethylcobaltocene, possessing
a reduction potential of −1.44 V vs Ag/AgCl. The anion radical
of the porphycene was formed and checked by the change in the absorption
spectra. The spectral change induced by the reductant was similar
to that observed by the electrochemical one-electron reduction in
THF, indicating that it was not due to the change in the valence of
the central metal ion, but the formation of the radical anion species
of the porphycene ligand. When this reduction proceeded in CH2Cl2, the porphycene–Co–CH2Cl complex was generated and successfully isolated. The resembling
Co–alkyl complexes were formed in THF by the chemical reduction
and the following reaction with alkyl halides.

Conclusions
In
summary, we found that the one-electron reduced species of the
Co(II) porphycene, Co(II) porphycene radical anion, reacts with alkyl
halides to form Co–C bonds under N2 atmosphere.
The Co–C bond formation reaction discovered here is a new type
of reactivity, which had not seen in the cobalt complexes. The reaction
mechanism was clarified by the combination of experimental and theoretical
studies. The ligand-reduced species of Co(II) porphycene was detected
by photoelectrochemistry and ESR measurement, and the cobalt–alkyl
complexes could be isolated after the constant potential electrolysis.
DFT calculations revealed that the porphycene ligand works as a noninnocent
ligand and afforded cobalt–alkyl complex by the SN2-type reaction between cobalt center and substrate. Further investigation
to construct a catalytic cycle by using a redox-active porphycene
ligand is now underway in our group.

Experimental Section
General
Information
Reagents and solvents of the best
grade available were purchased from commercial suppliers and were
used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. Dried dichloromethane
(CH2Cl2) and DMF were obtained by distillation
from CaH2 under N2 atmosphere. THF was dried
by distillation from benzophenone/sodium under N2 atmosphere.
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz NMR spectrometer.
The resonance frequencies are 500 and 125 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively. Chemical shifts were reported as δ
values in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane. High-resolution electron
spray ionization time-of-flight mass spectra (HR-ESI-TOF-MS) were
measured on JMS-T100LC-AccuTOF and microTOFQII spectrometer (JEOL,
Japan). Ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared (UV–vis–NIR)
absorption spectra were recorded on U-3310 spectrometer (Hitachi,
Japan) and V-670KS (JASCO, Japan). Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement
was carried out with a JES-FE1G X-band spectrometer (JEOL) equipped
with an Advantest TR-5213 microwave counter and an Echo Electronics
EFM-200 NMR field meter.

Redox potentials were measured by the
cyclic voltammetry method on an ALS electrochemical analyzer model
630C in glovebox. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out
using 1.6 mm diameter platinum working electrode and platinum wire
counter electrode in dehydrated solvents containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte under nitrogen atmosphere
at room temperature. In this experiment, we employed a Ag/10 mM AgCl
reference electrode. The reference electrode was separated from the
bulk solution by a fritted-glass bridge filled with 0.1 M KCl aqueous
solution.

DFT Calculation
We optimized local minima on the potential
energy surfaces using the B3LYP method.33,34 To estimate
excited states, TD calculations35 with
the B3LYP method were performed using optimized structures. We used
the TZVP (for Co, C, H, and N) basis36 and
the SDD (for I) basis.37 Vibration frequencies
were systematically computed to ensure that on a potential energy
surface each optimized geometry corresponds to a local minimum that
has no imaginary frequency. The Gaussian 09 program package38 was used for all DFT calculations.

Synthesis of TPrPc and Co(II)Pc
TPrPc and Co(II)Pc were synthesized as
described in the literature.39,27

Synthesis of CH2Cl–Co(III)Pc and CH3–Co(III)Pc
The electrosyntheses
of CH2Cl–Co(III)Pc and CH3I–Co(III)Pc were performed under N2 atmosphere and in the dark using the following procedure: 5.8 mg
(11 μmol) of Co(II)Pc was dissolved in either 12
mL of CH2Cl2 or a mixture of 10 mL of DMF and
2 mL of CH3I containing 0.1 M TBABF4. Bulk electrolysis
of the solution was performed at −1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl for 2 h
using a divided cell system consist of a platinum mesh electrode as
working, a zinc plate electrode as counter (sacrificial), and a cell
guard 2400 film as a separator. After completion of electrolysis,
the solution was transferred from the cell and the solvent was evaporated
to dryness using a stream of N2 gas. The residue was dissolved
in diethyl ether and the insolubles were removed by filtration. The
resultant organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure, and 1H NMR measurement was performed on the residual solid.
