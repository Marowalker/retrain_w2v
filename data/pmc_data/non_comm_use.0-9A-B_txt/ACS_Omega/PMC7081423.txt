The
clinical impact and accessibility of 99mTc tracers
for cancer diagnosis would be greatly enhanced by the availability
of a new, simple, and easy labeling process and radiopharmaceuticals.
In this study, Technetium-99m-imatinib mesylate ([99mTc]TcIMT) was developed and prepared as a new radiopharmaceutical
for breast cancer diagnosis. The effect of critical process parameters
on the product quality and stability of [99mTc]TcIMT was investigated using the quality by design concept of
the ICH Q8 (Pharmaceutical Development) guideline. [99mTc]TcIMT was subjected to in vitro cell binding studies
to determine healthy and cancer cell affinity using HaCaT and MCF-7
cells, respectively. The optimal radiolabeling procedure with 1 mg
of IMT, 500 μg of stannous chloride, 0.1 mg of ascorbic acid,
and 1mCi 99mTc radioactivity was obtained for
[99mTc]TcIMT. The pH of the reaction mixture
was adjusted to 10 and allowed to react for 15 min at room temperature.
The radiochemical purity of [99mTc]TcIMT was
found to be higher than 90% at room temperature up to 6 h. Chromatography
analysis revealed >85% [99mTc]TcIMT complex
formation with promising stability in saline, cell medium, and serum
up to 6 h. The radiolabeled complex showed a higher cell-binding ratio
to MCF-7 cells (88.90% ± 3.12) than HaCaT cells (45.64 ±
4.72) when compared to 99mTc. Our findings show that the
developed preparation method for [99mTc]TcIMT falls well within the proven acceptable ranges. Applying quality
by design (QbD) principles is feasible and worthwhile for the preparation
of [99mTc]TcIMT. In conclusion, radiochemical
purity, stability, and in vitro cell binding evaluation of the [99mTc]TcIMT complex indicate that the agent can
be utilized for imaging of breast cancer cells.

==== Body
Introduction
Imatinib mesylate (IMT), a tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, acts by competitively
blocking the ATP binding site of the receptors. It has revolutionized
medicine as a specific drug for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.1 Except this, IMT has been used in many diseases
which exemplified by various protein kinase-active cancers such as
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, especially breast cancer.1−8

Diagnosis of breast cancer can be good if it is stated in
early
phases; however, in the presence of metastatic disease, five year
survival decreased significantly. The development of new imaging agents
and techniques is important for early diagnosis of breast cancer and
patient survival.9,10 Nuclear medicine imaging techniques
have advantages over radiological imaging in terms of higher specificity
with a similar high sensitivity for cancer detection.11,12 Moreover, the use of nuclear medicine imaging in detection of tumors
allows prevention of unnecessary diagnostic invasive procedures. More
than 80% of all nuclear medicine, single photon emission computerized
tomography (SPECT) scans are used to detect cancer with radiopharmaceuticals.13 Radiopharmaceuticals consist of two components,
a pharmaceutical and radionuclide with a specific radiation.13,14 For diagnostic purposes, gamma emitter radionuclides are preferred
in accordance with their low linear energy transfer which results
in low tissue damage in the targeted organ. Among gamma emitter radionuclides,
Technetium-99m (99mTc) is the most used radioisotope in
the preparation of SPECT radiopharmaceuticals. Tc-99m is the decay
product of Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), which is mainly generated in research
reactors, and has ideal properties such as 6 h physical half-life,
low cost and energy, and ready availability.14−16 The pharmaceutical
part of radiopharmaceuticals is responsible for the accumulation of
the radionuclide in the targeted tissue. High accumulation in the
target tissue and low accumulation in the nontarget tissue are preferred
to increase the resolution and sensitivity of the images and to reduce
radiation damage in the rest of the body. To achieve the high target/nontarget
ratio, the receptor specific molecules are radiolabeled for cancer
imaging and therapy. Herein, IMT and 99mTc were used as
pharmaceutical and radionuclide parts to prepare the [99mTc]TcIMT complex that is formed by the direct radiolabeling
method (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic
design of the direct radiolabeling method for [99mTc]TcIMT.

There are samples of radiopharmaceuticals
including 99mTc-labeled small-molecule inhibitors. The
investigators at Molecular
Insight Pharmaceuticals (MIP) developed a series of novel glutamate–urea
(Glu–urea) amino acid heterodimeric inhibitors of PSMA for
developing SPECT radiopharmaceuticals using 99mTc because
it is the optimal radionuclide for developing SPECT radiopharmaceuticals,
and the investigators at MIP developed 2 high-affinity small-molecule
PSMA inhibitors, MIP-1404 and MIP-1405, which are successfully labeled
with 99mTc based on novel tricarbonyl chemistry.17,18 The QbD approach was described in the International Council for
Harmonization (ICH) guidelines such as Q8 Pharmaceutical Development,
Q9 Quality Risk Management, and Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System.
These systems are the fundamental guidelines for drug research.19,20

The main function of QbD is developing a method that is suitable
for keeping the changes within an acceptable range in order to maintain
the same product quality, instead eliminating the changes in formulation
or process steps. For this purpose, experimental studies should be
designed, necessary process and product assessments and measurements
should be made, data analyses should be performed, and the design
space should be formed.21

The aim
of this study is to develop a new radiopharmaceutical that
is [99mTc]TcIMT and investigate the influence
of preparation conditions on the quality of the radiopharmaceutical
product and its stability by application of QbD principles. For this
purpose, the concentration of IMT was determined with in vitro cytotoxicity
studies. IMT was radiolabeled using 99mTc, and the quality
control of the radiolabeled complex was performed with radioactive
thin layer chromatography (RTLC). The effect of formulation parameters
such as reducing and antioxidant agents and also incubation time on
the labeling efficiency was aimed to be enlightened and obtain an
optimum value for each parameter via MODDE Pro (Sartorius Stedim Data
Analytics) and create design space. Furthermore, the in vitro cell-binding
capacity of [99mTc]TcIMT to MCF-7 and HaCaT
cells was investigated.

Results
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Studies
The cell viability ratios
were found to be 85.5, 89.9, 93.5, 96.3, 97.8, and 99% for 1500, 750,
350, 150, 75, and 5 μg/mL in MCF-7 cells at the end of 48 h
(Figure 2). Furthermore,
1500 μg/mL IMT provides 83.5% cell viability, 750 μg/mL
provides 88.9% cell viability, 350 μg/mL provides 94.7% cell
viability, 150 μg/mL provides 98.5% cell viability, 75 μg/mL
provides 99.1% cell viability, and 5 μg/mL provides 99.6% cell
viability for HaCaT cells at the end of 48 h (Figure 2). According to the results, while the IMT
concentration increased, cell viability % decreased. An IMT concentration
of 350 μg/mL and below provides above 90% cell viability for
MCF-7 and HaCaT cells. The IC50 values were calculated
as 34.6 ± 2.7 and 25.3 ± 1.44 μM for MCF-7 and HaCaT
cells, respectively. These values suggested that the concentration
applied in MCF-7 and HaCaT cells was not likely to cause toxicity
and further radiolabeling studies were performed with 1 mg of IMT.

cells at the end of 48 h.

Defining Optimized Formulation
To diagnose different
types of cancer disease, new radiopharmaceuticals are developed and
their standard procedure is still being studied by research groups
and health authorities. The critical parameters such as the reducing
agent, antioxidant agent, and incubation time for the radiolabeling
process provide optimized radiopharmaceuticals and influence the quality
of these products. Within the scope of QbD, modelling parameters to
obtain optimized formulation were evaluated, and the results are given
in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Modelling parameters
of the optimized formulation.

The design and knowledge space limit values of the inputs and outputs
were calculated with multiple linear regression (MLR), and the results
are shown in Figure 4. The requirement of the QbD approach such as minimum–maximum
values of the design space was provided from the knowledge space.
After providing a successful design space with the QbD steps, the
optimum formulation was determined using MODDE pro, and the results
are demonstrated in Table 1.

One formulation was prepared using these optimal
parameters, and
then, quality control of this formulation was performed. The optimal
formulation’s contents were found to be 554.5 mg of stannous
chloride, 0.0625 mg of ascorbic acid, and 8.12 min of incubation time
with the predicted value of radiochemical purity.

Studies on
Optimal Formulation
Radiolabeling Studies
The radiolabeling
of IMT with 99mTc was carried out. Radiochemical
purity/radiolabeling
efficiency of [99mTc]TcIMT was analyzed by
RTLC. The amounts of radioactive impurities were separated and quantified
by two different solvent systems.

The Rf values of mobile phases and the RTLC chromatogram of [99mTc]TcIMT are presented in Figure 5. The free 99mTc
migrated forward with acetone as a solvent, while [99mTc]TcIMT and reduced/hydrolyzed (R/H) 99mTc remained
at the spotting point in saline as the other solvent. The radiochemical
purity of [99mTc]TcIMT at 37 MBq was found
to be over 90%.

(B) saline.

Effect of the Reducing
Agent on the Radiolabeling Process
The stability of the radiopharmaceuticals
depends on its contents,
such as the pharmaceutical part, reducing agent, and antioxidants
used in the formulation. There are many studies in the preparation
of new 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals which have stannous chloride
as a reducing agent. Stannous chloride also facilitated radiolabeling
reactions.22,23 In this study, the effect of
stannous chloride on the radiolabeling process was examined, and ideal
stannous chloride amount was found to be 500 μg. The radiochemical
purity of [99mTc]TcIMT with 500 μg/mL
stannous chloride solution was over 90% and did not change significantly
for 6 h at room temperature (p > 0.05) (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Effect of stannous chloride
solution on the radiolabeling process.

Effect of the Antioxidant Agent on the Radiolabeling Process
99mTc radiopharmaceuticals may have auto radiolysis
during preparation, release, and storage. Decomposition of radiopharmaceuticals
will decrease the targeting capability before and after administration.
Therefore, it is very important to use a stabilizer to minimize the
auto radiolysis. Radiolytic stabilizers are often antioxidants, such
as ascorbic acid, gentisic acid, and p-aminobenzoic
acid.24 In this study, ascorbic acid was
used as an antioxidant agent. The radiochemical purity of [99mTc]TcIMT was found to be greater than 85% at 0.1 and
0.5 mg of ascorbic acid. Our results demonstrate that radiochemical
purity in the presence of ascorbic acid was changed (p < 0.05) and 0.1 mg of ascorbic acid was used to radiolabel IMT
(Figure 7).

Figure 7 Effect of ascorbic
acid on the radiolabeling process.

Effect of Incubation Time on the Radiolabeling Process
The
radiochemical purity of the complexes containing 500 μg
of stannous chloride and 0.5 mg of ascorbic acid was examined at 5,
15, and 30 min to evaluate the effect of incubation time on the radiolabeling
process. The radiochemical purity of [99mTc]TcIMT was changed between sampling time intervals (p <
0.05) and found to be 75.4 ± 3.97% for 5 min incubation time
at the end of study time (Figure 8). Over 90% radiochemical purity was achieved for [99mTc]TcIMT, and there was no statistical difference
between the radiochemical purity values obtained at the end of the
6 h for 15 and 30 min (p > 0.05). The incubation
time was selected as 15 min for the radiolabeling process, taking
into consideration that the radiation exposure time should be kept
to a minimum in ALARA principles.25

Figure 8 Effect of incubation
time on the radiolabeling process.

According to all results, specific activity and radiochemical yield
of the radiolabeled complex were found to be 37 MBq and above 90%,
respectively. The optimal radiolabeling procedure with 500 μg
of stannous chloride and 0.1 mg of ascorbic acid was obtained for
[99mTc]TcIMT. Although [99mTc]TcIMT was needed to adjust the body pH, preparations in small
volume were adjusted to stabilize the pH. The pH of the radiolabeled
complex was measured and found to be 10. Radiolabeling was performed
with 99mTc (37 MBq) in 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.1
mL) and the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for
15 min prior to radiochemical analysis. Also, the acidic (pH = 3–5)
and neutral pH (pH = 7–7.4) values were studied to prepare
[99mTc]TcIMT but precipitation was observed
in [99mTc]TcIMT for both pH values.

Stability
of [99mTc]TcIMT in Different
Media
The stability of [99mTc]TcIMT was examined in saline, cell medium, and serum. The radiochemical
purity of [99mTc]TcIMT was found to be between
85 and 95% for 6 h in saline cell medium and saline (p > 0.05) (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Stability of [99mTc]TcIMT in different
media.

Microbiological Analysis
of [99mTc]TcIMT
The absence and growth
of microorganisms in the vials containing
[99mTc]TcIMT were observed visibly and clearly.
Also, the gel clot test indicated that [99mTc]TcIMT was pyrogen free.

Cell-Binding Studies
The cell-binding
results of [99mTc]TcIMT are demonstrated in Table 2. Although the cell-binding
ratio of 99mTc solution was found to be 15.77 ± 10.45,
the cell-binding ratio of [99mTc]TcIMT was
found to be 88.90 ± 3.12% for MCF-7 cells. The highest MCF-7
cell-binding capacity was provided with [99mTc]TcIMT. When the results obtained from HaCaT cells were evaluated,
it was observed that the binding ratio was 45.64 ± 4.72 and 10.93
± 1.035 for [99mTc]TcIMT and 99mTc, respectively. Also, the cell-binding capacity of [99mTc]TcIMT was found to be higher than 99mTc
solution for each cell lines and time intervals.

Discussion
The choice of radionuclide and pharmaceutical
parts in the preparation
of radiopharmaceuticals is significant. Although the pharmaceutical
part of the radiopharmaceutical is kept in mind for obtaining desired
localization, the radionuclide part should be thought in terms of
the compatibility, half-life, energy emission and values, stability,
stoichiometry, and molecular size. Herein, IMT and 99mTc
have created the pharmaceutical and radionuclide part of radiopharmaceuticals,
respectively.

The aim of this study is to develop new radiopharmaceuticals
by
combining the radiolabeling process and QbD. In radiolabeling studies,
varying most of the parameters investigated did result in adequate
radiochemical purity and stability. However, in some experiments,
unacceptable results (radiochemical purity < 90%) were obtained.
Performing the labeling with different amounts of reducing and antioxidant
agents, incubation time, and optimal conditions may yield a less stable
product. The reducing agent is important for 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals.
Although the colloidal systems form and the radiochemical purity starts
to decline in the presence of high reducing agent concentrations,
the free technetium ratio decreases in the presence of low reducing
agent concentrations. Commonly, the stannous salts are used as reducing
agents in 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals. Although technetium
is a stable pertechnetate in the +7 oxidative state, radiolabeled
compounds have been formulated with oxidation states from −1
to +7. Reducing agents lead to reduction of 99mTc from
the +7 oxidation state to the more reactive +5 oxidation state to
encourage the connection of 99mTc and the pharmaceutical
part.26 Herein, [99mTc]TcIMT was prepared using stannous chloride. Also, ascorbic acid
is an antioxidant and used as a radiolysis stabilizer. Incubation
time is another important parameter of the radiolabeling process.
There are few studies about radiolabeling of IMT derivatives with
the positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclide. Glekas et al.
performed the synthesis of the 2-fluoroethyl analogue of imatinib
(SKI696) and radiolabeling of this molecule and pure IMT with 18F. IMT and SKI696 molecules (1–5 mg) with 200 μL
of 18F containing 370–555 MBq of radioactivity and
heat was applied on the labeling complex at 90 °C for 10–15
min. According to their results, 18F-IMT and SKI696 complexes
remained stable (up to 90%) at room temperature for up to 4 h after
labeling.27 Peng et al. synthesized two
series of IMT (STI-571) analogues to develop a Bcr-Abl and c-KIT receptor-specific
labeling agent for PET imaging. The radiolabeling of STI-571 with 18F and 131I was performed by the long and complex
reaction. 18F-labeled STI-571 was prepared with high specific
activity (75 GBq/μmol) by nucleophilic displacement and an average
radiochemical purity of 12%. 131I-labeled STI-571 was prepared
with high radiochemical purity (>90%).28 Kumar et al. developed the procedure for radiolabeling of an anticancer
drug tamoxifen with 99mTc for tumor diagnosis and to evaluate
the diagnostic effect of the radiolabeled compound in mice. Radiolabeling
efficiency of tamoxifen with 99mTc was found to be 97%.
In vitro stability of the labeled complex increased with time and
reached maximum at 2 h (98.1 ± 0.17). This study indicates that 99mTc-labeled tamoxifen can be used as a potential tumor diagnostic
agent with low uptake in normal tissues.29 In this study, IMT was labeled with 99mTc using a reducing
agent and [99mTc]TcIMT was found to be stable
for 6 h. The various complexes of 99mTc may be formed by
interactions between electron donor atoms and reduced technetium.
In order to form bonds with technetium, the structure must contain
electron donors such as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur. The
possible nature of [99mTc]TcIMT binding is
caused by coordination of IMT that has electron donor atoms such as
nitrogen in its structure with 99mTc.30 The radiochemical purity > 90% was maintained for up
to
6 h. In addition, the stability of [99mTc]TcIMT in human serum, cell medium, and saline was maintained for 6 h.

QbD is a scientific way that develops new pharmaceutical product
development and produces scientific data quickly. The objective of
QbD is rapidly yielding a more coherent pharmaceutical product with
high quality in a short period. Although there are a number of studies
in QbD-based nanostructured drug delivery system research,31,32 application of essential elements of the quality by design-concept
from ICH Q8 is new for the preparation and development of radiopharmaceuticals.20,33,34 Herein, we combined and evaluated
the QbD and preparation of 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals by
the influence of changing preparation parameters on radiochemical
purity and stability of [99mTc]TcIMT. The
quality features and process parameters are significant to carry out
desired QbD. They have been defined after obtaining [99mTc]TcIMT. The antioxidant and reducing agents and incubation
time are the most fundamental features of 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals
which are liable for efficacy/efficiency and stability of radiolabeled
compounds.35 In this regard, these parameters
were chosen as critical quality attributes. When QbD and practical
acceptable ranges were evaluated together, the results obtained by
both methods were not statistically different (p >
0.05) in this study. Mapping the proven acceptable ranges, by validating
the preparation process for every individual parameter while keeping
all other variables constant, is worthwhile for assuring the product
quality and, therefore, contributes to the Good Manufacturing Practice.36

A high target to nontarget ratio of radiopharmaceuticals
in the
desired area has a critical role in clinical administrations. It can
affect the quality of target organ images because radiopharmaceuticals
can have little localization in the nontarget organs. The high specificity
on the target organ is important for ideal radiopharmaceuticals; only
then will it result in a high target to nontarget ratio. If it does
not happen, radiopharmaceutical localization in nontarget areas can
cause injury in these tissues.37 In vitro
cell-binding studies indicated that the highest cell-binding capacity
was observed with [99mTc]TcIMT for MCF-7 cells
and the binding ratio of [99mTc]TcIMT to breast
cancer cells was found to be higher than that of 99mTc
solution. Also, the cell-binding ratio has been changed at time intervals
(60 and 120 min), according to the obtained results (Table 2). Despite the exact reason
not being explained, these changes may be due to the pharmaceutical
and radionuclide part of [99mTc]TcIMT, affinity
of [99mTc]TcIMT to cells, and time. Furthermore,
we believe that these results can be a pioneer and guide for further
in vivo studies.

Conclusions
The radiolabeling process
and QbD implementation were combined,
and [99mTc]TcIMT was designed and prepared.
A design space was formed for determining the quality target product
profile by QbD, and the radiolabeling procedure was optimized using
this design space. Optimal [99mTc]TcIMT was
prepared as a result of mathematical modeling, and the quality control
of [99mTc]TcIMT was realized. In the view
of all results, a new radiolabeled complex has been developed which
has predetermined quality features, high radiolabeling efficiency,
and cell binding capacity for MCF-7.

Experimental Section
IMT was kindly provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland).
Technetium-99m pertechnetate (Na99mTcO4) was
obtained from the Department of Nuclear Medicine of Ege University.
The MCF-7 and HaCaT cells were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC).

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Studies
MCF-7
and HaCaT cells
and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) were used for in vitro cytotoxicity studies. The cells (1 ×
105/well) were seeded in 24-well plates. The cells were
incubated with IMT in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide solutions. Six different
concentrations of IMT solutions (5, 75, 150, 350, 750, and 1500 μg/mL)
were administered to the cells at 37 °C. After the 48 h incubation
of IMT solutions and cells, the solutions containing IMT were taken
out and 1 mg/mL MTT in phosphate-buffered saline solution was added.
The absorbance was measured at 540 nm to determine the viable cells.
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated
using GraphPad Prism and fitting a “one-site total binding”
algorithm program. The IMT concentration and absorbance values were
entered as X and Y values, respectively.
Nonlinear regression was selected, and IC50 values were
seen in the screen. According to IC50 values, the dose
of the pharmaceutical part for radiolabeled IMT was determined.

Identification of Critical Parameters in the Radiolabeling Process
Reducing
Agent
Several studies concerning the usage
of reducing agents such as stannous derivatives were identified in
the literature.14,38−42

Antioxidant Agent
The amount of
the antioxidant agent
was identified as a critical parameter. The usage of ascorbic acid
as an antioxidant agent is common43−47 for Tc-99m radiopharmaceuticals.

Incubation
Time
Incubation time was also determined
as a critical parameter in the preparation process of radiopharmaceuticals.
Studies have demonstrated that adequate labeling needs a certain amount
of time.39,44

Defining the Critical Ranges
for the Identified Radiolabeling
Process Variables
Radiolabeling Studies
Radiolabeling
studies were performed
in the presence of reducing (stannous chloride) and antioxidant (ascorbic
acid) agents and different incubation time periods to find the optimum
radiolabeling conditions. IMT was directly labeled with 99mTc. A total of 1 mg of IMT was dissolved in 1 mL of saline. The reducing
agent solution (10, 50, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL stannous chloride
in 0.01 N HCl) and the antioxidant agent (0.1 and 0.5 mg of ascorbic
acid) were added to the solution. Radiolabeling was performed with
freshly eluted 37 mBq/0.1 mL 99mTc. The mixture was shaken
for 60 s, filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size cellulose nitrate
membrane, and incubated for different time intervals (5, 15, and 30
min) at room temperature. The pH of the radiolabeled complex was examined
using a pH meter, and the radiochemical purity of the complex was
analyzed by RTLC.

RTLC Procedure
RTLC eluents were
grouped as mobile
and stationary phases. Acetone, physiological serum, methanol/ammonium
solution mixture (20:1 as v/v), chloroform/methanol (6:4 as v/v),
and pyridine/acetic acid/water mixture (3:1:2 as v/v) were assayed
as mobile phases. Silicagel plaque (SG), instathinlayer silicagel
plaque (ITLC-SG), and Whatman 3M papers were evaluated as stationary
phases to analyze the radiochemical purity of [99mTc]TcIMT. Although the ideal stationary phase was found to be ITLC-SG
which is having dimensions of (1.5 × 14) cm, free and R/H 99mTc was separated with acetone and serum physiological as
the mobile phases. The radioactivity on plaques was measured using
an RTLC scanner (AR 2000, Bioscan, USA), and the percent radiochemical
purity of 99mTc-IMT was calculated from the following equation
(eq 1) 1  

Effect of the Reducing
Agent on the Radiolabeling Process
99mTc pertechnetate
was eluted from a 99Mo/99mTc generator in the 99mTc(VII) oxidation state
which was not able to label with any compound on direct addition.
Therefore, prior to the labeling procedure, reduction of 99mTc is required for converting 99mTc from the 99mTc(VII) state to a desired lower oxidation state, which can make
complexes with the ligand to form the radiopharmaceutical. Different
types of reduction agents are used for this reason. Herein, stannous
chloride was used to perform the radiolabeling process.47 IMT (1 mg) was dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride
solution (1 mL). Reduction of 99mTc was performed with
different amounts of stannous chloride in 0.01 N HCl (10, 50, 250,
500, and 1000 μg/mL). Stannous chloride solution was added to
IMT solution, under an atmosphere of bubbling nitrogen. Freshly eluted
37 mBq/0.1 mL 99mTc was added to each vials. The vials
were shaken for 60 s, filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size membrane
filter, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The pH of [99mTc]TcIMT was measured. The radiochemical purity
of the complex was determined by RTLC.

Effect of the Antioxidant
Agent on Radiolabeling
IMT
(1 mg) was dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride solution (1 mL) in three
groups of vials. Stannous chloride (500 μg/mL) in 0.01 N HCl
was added to each individual group. The radiolabeling was performed
in the absence and presence (0.1 and 0.5 mg) of ascorbic acid. The
pH of the solution was measured. Freshly eluted 37 mBq/0.1 mL 99mTc was added to each vial. The vials were shaken for 60
s, filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size membrane filter, and
incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The radiochemical purity
was analyzed by RTLC.

Effect of Incubation Time on Radiolabeling
The incubation
time is important for the radiochemical purity of 99mTc
radiopharmaceuticals. IMT (1 mg) was dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride
solution (1 mL) in three groups of vials. Stannous chloride (500 μg/mL)
in 0.01 N HCl and 0.1 mg of ascorbic acid were added to each individual
group. The pH of the solution was measured. Freshly eluted 37 mBq/0.1
mL 99mTc was added to each vial. The vials were shaken
for 60 s, filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size membrane filter,
and incubated for 5, 15, and 30 min at room temperature. After that,
the radiochemical purity was evaluated by RTLC.

Stability
of [99mTc]TcIMT
In
vitro stability of [99mTc]TcIMT was estimated
in the saline, cell medium, and serum by incubating 100 μL of
the complex with 900 μL of media at room temperature. Aliquots
at different time periods were applied on an ITLC-SG strip and allowed
to run in 100% acetone to check any dissociation and degradation of
the labeled complex. The dissociation was estimated as the % radiolabeled
complex remaining after the incubation time of 6 h.

Implementation
of QbD
Mathematical Modeling and Optimization
In order to
achieve the optimum formulation and method which meets the required
quality attributes, research studies and the data from preformulation
studies were interpreted and the knowledge space of the formulation
components and process parameters was established. Then, the experimental
data were evaluated in a piece of software using statistical methods
and response surface methodology in order to create an experimental
design, model fitting to a response surface model using MLR, which
was used for evaluation of the optimal formulation and process parameters,
and form a design space. Also, it encompasses the multidimensional
combination, interaction of input variables, and process parameters
and has been shown to obtain the assurance of quality according to
ICH Q8 (R2).20,21

In MODDE Pro 12, four statistical
parameters such as R2, Q2, model validity, and reproducibility are used to establish
the model accuracy which leads to the usage of the optimum formulation.
A model fit with low significance has values of R2 below 0.5. Q2 which should
be above 0.5 for a good model which refers to precision of the prediction.
A value for reproducibility higher than 0.5 indicates reproducible
results which can also lead to low model validity.48

Microbiological Analysis of Optimal [99mTc]TcIMT
Sterility Test
The radiolabeled complex was incubated
with Thioglycollate broth and Tryptic Soy Broth medium at 37 ±
2 °C in the vials. The vials were controlled visibly during the
sterility test.

Pyrogenicity Test
The pyrogenicity
test is performed
using a Pyrotell Gel-Clot formulation (Associates of Cape Cod Incorporated,
Falmouth, MA, USA).

Cell Culture Studies
McCoy’s
5A containing 10%
fetal bovine serum was used for both cells. The cells were incubated
at 37 °C under 90% humidity and 5% CO2.49,50

Cell-Binding Studies
A total of 1 × 106 cells/well were dispensed in 6-well plates and incubated for 7 days
in an incubator to adhere the membrane. [99mTc]TcIMT (37 MBq/0.5 mL) was put into the cells and incubated for
120 min. The cell culture medium was collected at 60 and 120 min.
After removal of the cell culture medium, the cells were consecutively
washed with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline to separate free 99mTc and trypsinized with 0.5 mL of trypsin to remove the
cells. The cell medium (1 mL) was added to the trypsinized cells,
and the system was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The activities
in the tubes containing sediment cells and in the tubes containing
culture medium were both counted using a gamma counter (Sesa Uniscaller).
The radioactivity of cells as percentage was calculated from the following
equation (eq 2) 2  

Total radioactivity refers to the radioactivity
of cells and cell medium.

Statistical Analysis
The calculation
of means and standard
deviations was performed on Microsoft Excel. One-way Anova was used
to determine statistical significance. Differences at the 95% confidence
level (p < 0.05) were considered significant.
