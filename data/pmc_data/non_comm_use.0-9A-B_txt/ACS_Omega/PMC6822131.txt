Amylose inclusion complexes were
prepared in aqueous solution with
the amphiphilic moiety 3-pentadecylphenol via a direct mixing method.
Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
as well as differential scanning calorimetry confirmed the formation
of amylose inclusion complexes. The morphology of the synthesized
complexes is sensitive to temperature, and X-ray data revealed that
the inclusion complexes exhibited distinct structures at different
temperatures. Small-angle X-ray scattering data indicated ordered
lamellar structures of the synthesized complexes at room temperature,
and wide-angle X-ray scattering profiles showed the transformation
of the crystalline structure as a function of the temperature. The
results of this research will help to understand the relationship
between the inclusion complex structures with temperature.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Starch is composed of two distinct components: essentially linear
or slightly branched amylose consisting of α-1,4-glycosidic
bonds and highly branched amylopectin having α-1,4-glycosidic
and α-1,6-glycosidic bonds.1−3 The amylose chains have
a helical hydrophobic interior cavity, and it is known to form inclusion
complexes via hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions4−8 with hydrophobic guest moieties such as dyes,9 flavors,10,11 lactones,12 polymers,13−15 and lipids.16,17 The formation of the
complex increases the physical and chemical stability of lipophilic
guest molecules by shielding them against oxidation, evaporation,
and decomposition. These kinds of inclusion complexes show their potential
applications in food and pharmaceutical applications for nanoencapsulation,18 control release of the drugs,19 and flavor encapsulations.20

Different ligands display a distinct interaction with amylose,
and their interactions can significantly influence the structural
properties of amylose inclusion complexes. The morphologies of the
amylose inclusion complexes are known to be greatly affected by experimental
conditions such as concentration of amylose and guest molecules, temperature,
and pressure.7a,11 Depending on the guest molecules, amylose
inclusion complexes of 6, 7, or 8 glucosyl residues per helical turn
are obtained for alcohols, acetone, lipids, and naphthol.21−23 Therefore, it is always interesting to explore distinct crystal
structures of the resulting complexes of amylose with different complexing
agents.

The impact of guest molecules and other experimental
parameters
on the morphological properties of synthesized inclusion complexes
are most often explored by X-ray scattering techniques, and we have
recently explored the structural characterization of amylose-polymer
inclusion complexes by these techniques.6,7 In the present
study, different concentrations of the pentadecylphenol (PDP) complexing
agent is used to form amylose-PDP inclusion complexes. PDP is a naturally
occurring amphiphilic phenolic surfactant obtained from cashew nut
oils and has potential applications in medicine, resin additives,
and fuel additives.24 Facilitating the
formation of inclusion complexes with phenolic surfactants can extend
the shelf life of food products via reducing enzymatic browning.

The objective of this work was to synthesize inclusion complexes
of amylose with PDP and to further systematically elucidate the morphological
characteristics via attenuated total reflection Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS),
and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization techniques.
The effects of temperature and guest molecule concentration on the
morphology of amylose-PDP inclusion complex were also investigated.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Amylose
with a molecular
weight of ∼ 180 kg/mol was received from Avebe. PDP was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. PDP was recrystallized from petroleum ether and
dried under vacuum at room temperature for 24 h.

2.2 Synthesis of Amylose-PDP Inclusion Complexes
Amylose-PDP
complexes were prepared by suspending 500 mg of amylose
in 15 mL of deionized water followed by mixing 5, 10, and 20% (w/w)
PDP. The solution was rotated at room temperature for 2 h and transferred
to a pressure vessel. The pressure vessel was heated to 160 °C
for 1 h followed by cooling down to 80 °C. The solution was continuously
rotated at 80 °C overnight. Thereafter, the solutions were cooled
down to room temperature and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 30 min. The
supernatants were discarded, and filtrates were washed with hot water
to remove noncomplexed PDP. The washed precipitate samples were freeze-dried
overnight. The complexes of amylose with PDP mass ratios of 20:1,
10:1, and 5:1 are presented as APD-5, APD-10, and APD-20, respectively.

2.3 Characterization
Fourier transform
infrared spectra were recorded by a Bruker IFS88 FT-IR spectrometer
equipped with n MCT-A detector at a resolution of 4 cm–1. The simultaneous measurements of WAXS and SAXS data as a function
of temperature were measured at the Dutch-Belgium Beamline (DUBBLE)
station BM26B of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)
in Grenoble, France. The sample to detector distance of the SAXS setup
was ∼3.5 m, and the X-ray wavelength was 1.03 Å. A Linkam
DSC 600 cell was used to execute temperature resolved measurements.
The X-ray patterns were recorded with a heating/cooling rate of 5
°C/min in the temperature range of 25 to 160 °C. The scattering
vector q is denoted here as q =
4π/λ(sin θ), where 2θ is the scattering angle.25

3 Results and Discussion
Three different compositions of PDP molecules were mixed with amylose
to form inclusion complexes. The chemical structures of the pristine
materials and conformational changes during the complex formation
were investigated by FTIR. The FTIR spectra of PDP (a), amylose (b),
and different compositions (20:1, 10:1, and 5:1 mass ratios) of amylose
guest molecule (c), (d), and (e) are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 ATR-FTIR spectra of (a)
PDP, (b) amylose, (c) APD-5, (d) APD-10,
and (e) APD-20. (i) Wavenumber range 750 to 3800 cm–1. (ii) Magnified range of panel (i) between 750 and 1750 cm–1.

The common functional group stretching
and bending vibrations of
the amylose appeared in the range of 900–1200 and 2800–3400
cm–1, respectively. The typical characteristic peaks
of the C–C and C–O bonds of amylose were positioned
at about 990, 1080, and 1150 cm–1. The stretching
vibration of the C–O–C glycosidic bond and O–H
bonds were displayed at 850 and 3250 cm–1, respectively
(Figure 1b).26−28 The FTIR spectrum of PDP showed a broad absorption band of the phenolic
hydroxyl group at 3305 cm–1. The absorption bands
of the long pentadecyl chain were centered at 2916 and 2850 cm–1. The characteristic peaks of the substituted aromatic
ring were found at 1589, 1460, and 782 cm–1 (Figure 1a).29

Typically, the FTIR spectra of amylose-PDP inclusion
complexes
(Figure 1c,d) exhibited
the vibrational peaks of amylose and PDP. However, due to the insertion
of PDP into the amylose cavity, several characteristic absorption
peaks of PDP between 1600 and 1000 almost vanished in the inclusion
complex spectra. Moreover, the inclusion of the guest molecule splits
the band of 990 cm–1 into two separate peaks, and
these peaks appeared at 993 and 1014 cm–1 in the
inclusion complex spectra.7 The intensities
of these peaks decreased with increasing concentration of the PDP
guest molecules.

The amylose characteristic peaks at 1640, 1080,
and 855 cm–1 were found to shift at 1645, 1076,
and 860 cm–1, respectively. The shifting of the
vibrational frequencies
is similar to the shifts reported elsewhere for amylose inclusion
complex systems.7,30 The intensity of the peak at
2850 cm–1 increased with the insertion of PDP inside
the amylose cavity. Moreover, the broadening of the −OH peak
at around 3280 cm–1 occurred in the complex. The
disappearance of the guest absorption peaks, splitting of the 990
cm–1 band, and broadening of the −OH peak
in the complex spectrum confirmed the formation of the amylose-PDP
inclusion complex. Furthermore, the FTIR results suggest that the
hydrophobic forces are responsible for transfer of the PDP molecule
into the hydrophobic amylose helix cavity to form the amylose-PDP
inclusion complex.31

The thermal
properties of the amylose and inclusion complexes were
characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure 2). The thermogram
of amylose-PDP inclusion complexes showed an endotherm as compared
to pristine amylose that arises due to dissociation of the inclusion
complexes. A more detailed description of this behavior can be found
elsewhere.7,31,32 By increasing
the concentration of PDP, the endotherm enthalpy peak of the inclusion
complexes sharpens due to the higher crystalline nature of PDP. Furthermore,
the endothermic enthalpy increased with the concentration of PDP molecules,
which proved to be better complexation between amylose and PDP at
higher concentrations.

Figure 2 Thermograms (heating scan) of amylose and inclusion complexes
between
amylose and three different concentrations of PDP (ADP-5, APD-10,
and APD-20).

The effects of thermal treatment
and concentration of PDP on inclusion
complex structures were analyzed using synchrotron X-ray measurement.
The SAXS patterns of the APD-5 and APD-20 inclusion complexes were
recorded as a function of temperature (25 to 160 °C and vice
versa) as shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

Figure 3 SAXS intensity profiles
from APD-5 inclusion complex during (a)
heating cycle (b) cooling cycle.

Figure 4 SAXS patterns
of APD-20 during (a) heating cycle and (b) cooling
cycle.

The scattering peaks at q of 0.7, 1.4, and 2.1
nm–1 suggested a lamellar structure of the amylose-PDP
inclusion complexes at room temperature.33 Biais et al. reported that the lamellar structural organization
of the amylose complex constituted by alternating crystalline and
amorphous layers.34 The starting peak at
0.7 nm–1 is associated with the thickness of this
lamellar morphology.35

The van der
Waals forces, mainly hydrophobic–hydrophobic
interactions and H-bonds, play an important role in the inclusion
complex formation. The strength of Van der Waals forces decreased
with increasing temperature, and it had a significant influence on
the inclusion complex morphology. It was observed that the inclusion
complexes started to dissociate at 70 °C that is above the melting
temperature of PDP (54 °C), and this is indicated by a reduction
in the ordering of the lamellar structure. Furthermore, the SAXS patterns
showed that the intensity of peaks decreased with increasing temperature
and less well-defined peaks were obtained at the higher temperature.
The cooling X-ray profile showed the reorder of the lamellar structure
of the inclusion complexes. SAXS revealed the lamellar morphology
and disruption of the ordered lamellar morphology of the amylose-PDP
complexes with the temperature.

The concentrations of amylose
and complexing agent have a significant
impact on the morphology of the complexes. It was reported that the
concentration of the complexing agents can induce more than one type
of crystalline structure.36,37

In the present
study, the influence of the complexing agent concentration
on the inclusion complexes was investigated, and SAXS diagrams of
a higher amount of PDP (20 wt %) are recorded as a function of temperature.
The heating and cooling cycles of the inclusion complex are presented
in Figure 4a,b, respectively.
As shown in Figure 4a, APD-20 showed two characteristic peaks at about 0.7 and 1.4 nm–1, which confirms a lamellar structure of the inclusion
complex. However, higher PDP concentration reduced the intensity of
the higher order peaks. These results indicated that increasing the
amount of complexing agent might induce the random arrangements of
well-defined domains of alternating layers of crystalline and amorphous
regions.

The inclusion complexes were heated up to about 160
°C to
redissolve the complexes followed by cooling back to room temperature
to allow recrystallization of the complexes. The crystalline structure
of the inclusion complexes during the heat treatment was investigated
by WAXS. The representative WAXS patterns of the APD-5 and APD-20
complexes as a function of temperature are shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5a, the diffraction patterns
exhibit a typical crystalline structure displayed by different peaks
at 10.7, 12.5, 12.8, 13.5, 14.0, 15.8, and 17.1 nm–1 at 25 °C.38−40 After heat treatment, the intensities of the peaks
changed and shifted to new positions at 11.5, 12.8, 14.5, and 17.4
nm–1.

Figure 5 WAXS profile of (a,b) APD-5 and (c,d) APD-20
as a function of temperature
recorded during heating (a,c) and cooling (b,d) of the complex from
25 to 160 °C and vice versa, respectively.

The transition to a different crystalline structure with temperature
can be explained by temperature of crystallization and stabilizing
the guest molecule in the hydrophobic cavity of the amylose molecules.41 The WAXS data demonstrated that the inclusion
complex crystallizes into two polymorphs with the temperature. Similar
transformations of the crystalline structure of amylose inclusion
complexes during heat treatment have also been reported elsewhere.42,43 The complexes showed a stable crystal structures after the heat
treatment, and it remains intact during cooling as well. Furthermore,
a dominated sharp peak at 12.8 nm–1 of the heat-treated
sample suggested that the higher temperature induced the crystalline
size of the complex.

The WAXS profile of APD-20 at room temperature
(Figure 5c,d) displays
more vivid peaks
as compared to APD-5, and these peaks are located at 8.7, 10.7, 12.4,
12.8, 13.5, 14.0, 17.0 nm–1. It is observed that
the reorganization of less perfect crystalline structures occurred
with the temperature via restructuring of amorphous and crystalline
lamellae in order to provide more impeccable crystalline structures.44−46 The increasing number of peaks indicates that regularity of the
inclusion complex increased with the amount of crystalline host molecules.47 Similar to APD-5, the peaks moved to new positions
at 8.5, 9.2, 11.6, 12.9, and 17.5 nm–1 after the
heat treatment, which confirmed the transformations of the crystalline
structure of the complex due to the heat treatment.42,43 Some variations in the diffracted intensity of the peak at 12.9
cm–1 was observed with different concentrations
of complexing agents due to different crystal sizes of the complex. Figure 6 displays SAXS and
WAXS patterns at room temperature of APD-5, APD-10, and APD-20. The
SAXS profile clearly shows the presence of lamellar patterns of the
peaks.

and APD-20 (curves are offset for clarity).

4 Conclusions
The results of this study prove that PDP
can be effectively inserted
into the hydrophobic cavity of amylose in order to form amylose-PDP
inclusion complexes. The formation of the inclusion complexes was
confirmed by FTIR and DSC measurements. The DSC thermograms revealed
an increased stability of the complex at higher concentrations of
PDP. The crystalline structure and periodic organization of the complexes
as a function of temperature were analyzed by SAXS and WAXS. Two different
crystal structures of inclusion complexes were revealed by WAXS.

The complexation of PDP with amylose is a promising approach to
improve the utilization of these kinds of complexes in food and drug
industries, for instance, nanoencapsulation, controlled release of
the drugs, and flavor encapsulations. In addition, the self-assembly
of the inclusion complexes is expected to have potential applications
in supramolecular chemistry for the fabrication of hierarchical morphologies,
such as phase compatibilizers.
