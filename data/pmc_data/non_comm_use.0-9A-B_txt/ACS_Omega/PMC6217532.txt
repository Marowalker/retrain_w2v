Artificial
skin substitute made of polymeric films are of great
demand in the field of skin tissue engineering. We report here the
fabrication of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) blend films by solution casting method for wound healing applications.
The physicochemical characteristics and the thermal stability of the
films were analyzed. The surface morphology shows crystalline structures
with large hexagonal-like platelet crystals of CMC on the surface
of the films. Pure CMC films exhibited higher tensile strength than
the CMC/PEG blend films. The swelling ratio (SR) of the films was
influenced by the pH of Tris–HCL buffer (2.0, 5.0, and 7.0),
which increased with increase in pH. The hemocompatibility assay and
cytotoxicity test using NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells showed that the films
were biocompatible. To evaluate the wound healing efficacy, the films
were applied in full-thickness wounds created in normal and diabetic
Wistar albino rats. The wounds healed faster with pure CMC film compared
to blend films in both normal and diabetic rats, evidenced by intensive
collagen formation in histopathological analysis. Thus, the films
have potential application in skin regeneration, thereby to restore
the structural and functional characteristics of the skin.

Introduction
Over the past few decades, a large number
of studies have been
carried out on various strategies to develop appropriate wound dressing
materials to facilitate wound healing by providing template for better
recruitment of cells.1 An ideal wound dressing
material should be biocompatible and create a moist environment at
the wound site to prevent wound dehydration. Besides, the material
should protect the wound from dust and resist microbial invasion,
permit gaseous exchange, and promote epithelialization.2,3

The widely explored polymer-based wound dressings are tailored
from natural polymers like collagen, chitosan, gelatin, keratin, and
silk sericin and synthetic polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA),
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polycaprolactone
(PCL), and silicone in the form of film, foam, hydrogel, nanofiber,
woven matrix, etc.4−6 The most accepted biomaterials for wound healing
application are collagen, hyaluronic acid, and chitosan, which are
low antigenic, biocompatible, and biodegradable.7−9 Recent findings
show the fabrication of hyaluronic acid-grafted pullulan polymers
as films for wound healing applications.10 Electrospun potato starch-based nanofibrous scaffolds were also
prepared and utilized to promote cellular proliferation for dermal
wound healing.11 Currently, polymer surgical
dressings as sponges based on chitosan/sodium hyaluronate/resveratrol
were tailored to evaluate their regenerative effects in wound healing.12 Besides, the chitosan/collagen/alginate composite
was fabricated and evaluated for determining its promoting effect
on wound healing.13 But the use of these
polymeric dressing materials is usually limited due to weak mechanical
properties, poor biostability, and low shelf life.14 They have the tendency to shrink, deform, or contract,
indicating lack of support for cell ingrowth due to improper maintenance
of these materials structures.15 Gelatin
and keratin are used for the fabrication of wound dressings as they
have low antigenicity and can promote adhesion, differentiation, and
proliferation of cells. Nonwoven wound dressings were fabricated from
chicken feather keratin, keratin/chitosan, and keratin/sodium alginate
blends for skin regeneration purposes.16 But the major drawback of the polymers involved is their brittleness.17−19 Silk sericin is also considered as an attractive biomaterial for
wound healing owing to its low antigenicity and good mechanical properties.20 However, sericin sometimes leads to in vivo
inflammation as it suppresses proinflammatory cytokines production;
hence, the silk is often degummed during silk processing.21,22 On the other hand, synthetic polymers like PVA, PEG, PLA, PCL, and
silicone exhibit appreciable mechanical properties and also diverse
plasticity. Insulin delivering nanoparticles of chitosan was embedded
on electrospun PCL/collagen matrix to develop potential cutaneous
wound care materials.23 PVA/chitosan/zinc
oxide beads were also investigated as potential elements for wound
healing applications.24 But, synthetic
polymers when used alone exhibit immunogenic properties and are lightly
toxic in nature. Polyurethane-based commercial wound dressings like
Opsite, Tegaderm, and Biooclusive have been marketed, but they possess
poor absorbent properties.25 Lack of biological
cues in terms of cellular attachment hinders the use of these synthetic
polymers for skin regeneration applications.19,26 The current strategies focus on the fabrication of wound dressing
materials from a new class of polymer and their role in accelerating
chronic wound repair by regulated deposition of extracellular matrix.27

Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a derivative
of cellulose, has been
widely used in pharmaceutical industry as emulsifier, viscosity modifier,
lubricant, and stabilizer to develop different pharmaceutical dosage
formulations.28,29 CMC is a seminatural polymer
and has excellent water-absorbing and swelling capacities.30 It is physiologically nontoxic and is compatible
with mucous membrane, bone, and skin.31−33 CMC may be used as a
template for wound healing and skin regeneration applications, and
there is not much evidence that elaborates on the application of CMC
films to treat full-thickness wound or chronic wounds like diabetic
foot ulcers. The advantage of CMC is film formulation and the ability
to blend with other polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),
which is biocompatible, less toxic, and hydrophilic.34

The present study aims to fabricate CMC/PEG blend
films as wound
dressing materials for full-thickness normal and chronic (diabetic)
wound healing. As there has been limited reports on the effect of
CMC on full-thickness diabetic wound healing process, this work highlights
the potential of CMC polymer application in such cases. The films
were prepared using solution-casting method and characterized in terms
of its physicochemical, thermal, and mechanical properties. The pH-responsive
swelling behavior of CMC films in physiological body fluid was also
examined. The hemolytic potential and the cytocompatibility of the
films were also studied with fibroblast cells. Besides, the novelty
of the work lies in utilizing CMC-based films to treat chronic diabetic
wounds. A full-thickness wound model was adopted in normal and diabetic
rats to study the efficiency of the films for wound closure and skin
regeneration.

Results
Physicochemical Characterization
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the films are shown in Figure 1a. The crystalline nature of CMC is evident
with a high intensity peak at 2θ of 19.7°. The other diffraction
peaks of CMC are observed at 18.4, 22.7, 25.3, and 28.4°. The
peak intensity decreased as PEG concentration increases. This might
be due to the hydrogen-bond interaction between the carboxylic group
of CMC and the hydroxyl group of PEG, which resulted in change in
the crystallographic position of the two polymers after blending.35 Only one peak of PEG was observed at 2θ
of 20.7°, and other peaks of PEG are not visible due to low concentration
of PEG being used in the blend films.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of the
films. CMC and PEG peaks
are indexed as (•) and (Δ), respectively. (b) Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra; (c) differential scanning calorimeter
(DSC) curves; and (d) thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) traces of the
films.

The FTIR spectra of the films
are shown in Figure 1b. The band at 1024 cm–1 is due to −CH–O–CH2 stretching,
and the band at 1419 cm–1 is assigned to −CH2 scissoring vibration, whereas the absorption band at 1605
cm–1 confirmed the presence of the COO– group in CMC. The absorption band at 3224 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching of the −OH group of CMC.
The band at 1150 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching
of the C–O–C group for PEG. The scissoring and bending
of the C–H group for PEG are obtained at 1367 and 1429 cm–1, respectively, and the band at 2892 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching of the C–H group. For the blend
films, addition of PEG did not influence the structure of CMC.

The thermal behavior of the films analyzed by DSC and TGA is shown
in Figure 1c,d. The
pure CMC films (CMEG00) have a relatively large sharp endothermic
peak at 79 °C, the glass-transition temperature of CMC. A relatively
smaller endothermic glass-transition peak for CMEG25 and CMEG50 is
observed at 79 and 80 °C, respectively. The addition of PEG in
CMC showed a slight variation in the melting temperature, due to the
interaction between the functional groups of CMC and PEG. Due to the
high hydrophilicity of CMC, it still contained a small amount of moisture
water molecules, which is evident from the TGA curve as weight loss
(approximately 6%) at 86 °C. The weight loss at 200 °C is
due to the removal of carbon dioxide from the polysaccharide chain
and degradation of saccharide ring of CMC. The weight loss at 305
°C is attributed due to the breaking of −C–O–C
bonds present in CMC.36,37 The weight losses of the films
at 200 and 305 °C are 32 and 55%, respectively. The overall weight
loss of the films upon heating to 600 °C is 73%. All of the films
degraded effectively on heating, and the presence of PEG in CMC has
shown no influence on the thermal property of CMC.

Tensile Properties
The stress vs strain curves of the
films are shown in Figure 2. The maximum tensile stress, strength, and Young’s
modulus were calculated from the stress–strain curves and are
tabulated in Table 1. The maximum tensile stress of CMEG00 is 14 ± 3 kPa, higher
than that of CMEG25 (8 ± 2 kPa) and CMEG50 (10 ± 3 kPa).
The tensile strengths of CMEG00, CMEG25, and CMEG50 are 13 ±
3, 8 ± 3, and 11 ± 3 kPa, and Young’s moduli are
found to be 1 ± 0.21, 0.81 ± 0.18, and 1 ± 0.10 kPa,
respectively. The films were soft, and the pure CMC films possess
better tensile properties than the blend films.

ultimate tensile strength, and Young’s modulus were calculated
from the stress–strain curves.

Surface Morphology of the Films
The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of the films are shown in Figure 3a–c, The surface shows
platelet-like crystallites that are randomly arranged and overlayed
on the surface. The crystals seem to be thinner and more concentrated
in CMEG25, whereas higher the PEG amount, bigger and more coarse are
the crystals.

(b) CMEG25,
and (c) CMEG50 showing platelet-like crystals (magnification level:
5000×).

Effect of pH on Swelling
of Films
Water binding and
absorption ability of the films are crucial parameters for wound healing.
The effect of pH on swelling of the films was investigated in acidic
and neutral ranges of pH, and the results are shown in Figure 4. Three different pHs (2.0.
5.0, and 6.0) were chosen to determine the pH-responsive behavior
of CMC polymer. The swelling ratios of CMEG00, CMEG25, and CMEG50
in Tris–HCL buffer of pH 2.0 were 1228 ± 34, 1186 ±
32, and 703 ± 56%, respectively, and 1346 ± 32, 1263 ±
58, and 611 ± 42%, respectively, at pH 5.0. The film showed the
highest swelling ratios in Tris–HCL buffer at pH 7.0 as 1428
± 56, 1335 ± 24, and 1190 ± 32% for CMEG00, CMEG25,
and CMEG50, respectively. The swelling ratios of CMEG00 and CMEG25
have similar behaviors at all pHs, while CMEG50 showed lower swelling
ratios at pHs 2 and 5 and a similar behavior at pH 7. There is a slight
decrease of swelling ratio at all pHs with increasing PEG content,
but it was not significant. The addition of PEG does not influence
the swelling property of CMC.

pHs 2.0, 5.0, and
7.0 at 37 °C after 12 h (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ns = not
significant).

Biological Characterization
Hemocompatibility
Study
Hemocompatibility is a key
issue for the safety of dressing materials in wound healing. This
study reflected the degree of interaction between the films and the
blood. The impact of the films via contact activation has been studied.
The amount of RBC, WBC, and platelets adhered to the films, percentage
hemolysis, and plasma hemoglobin were measured and are summarized
in Table 2. The WBC
count (%) for the films was found to be higher than the control. On
the other hand, it is interesting to see that the RBC and platelet
counts (%) for CMEG00 and CMEG25 decreased compared to the control,
whereas the values increased for CMEG50. Hemolysis results indicate
any undesirable conditions originated from the biomaterials, and a
value of 0.2 indicates excellent biomaterial property of pure CMC
films.

a Empty polystyrene
tube exposed to
blood was taken as control.

The SEM images in Figure 5 show the adhered red blood cells on the surface of the films
after blood contact, thus indicating the ability of the polymer matrix
to entrap blood cells when exposed to blood. The cells are flat and
adherent, arranged in layers, and no rupture of the cells was visible
in CMEG00. There is a slight fusion or surface destruction in very
few cells in CMEG25, while the cells are not as flat as in CMEG50,
more or less spherical, and are not arranged very close to each other.
This suggests that CMEG00 has the ability to maintain the cell behavior
and structure, while in contact with blood, compared to blend films.

electron microscopy images of the red blood cells adhered
to the films: (a) CMEG00; (b) CMEG25, and (c) CMEG50 after hemocompatibility
test (magnification level: 15 000×).

Cell Cytotoxicity Study
The cytotoxicity of the film
extracts was analyzed by treating with the fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3).
The viabilities of the cells in contact with CMEG00, CMEG25, and CMEG50
extracts were found to be 92, 90, and 88%, respectively, and 95% for
control medium after 3 days of incubation as evaluated by cell viability
analyzer. The cell metabolic activity cultivated in the medium exposed
to the extracts as measured by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium blue (MTT)
assay indicated appreciable cell proliferation for all films.

Effect
of Films on Wound Healing
The aim of skin wound
treatment is to restore and revive the structural and functional properties
of damaged skin to normal tissue levels involving orchestrated regeneration
of skin with accelerated neovascularization, angiogenesis, and scar-free
integration of the surrounding skin. The efficacy of the films in
wound healing under normal healthy and diabetic conditions was evaluated
in rat models. Morphology of the gross appearance of the wounds with
and without films is shown in Figure 6 for different time periods (days 0, 8, and 16 postsurgery).

Figure 6 Photographs
of the wound area in normal and diabetic rat models
on days 0, 8, and 16 postsurgery, showing gradual healing of wound
with time. The wound in normal healthy rat healed completely on 16th
day (as marked by black circles), whereas in control and diabetic
rats, the wound still persisted. The scale bar is 1 cm.

The wounds in normal healthy rats reduced significantly
in size,
whereas the size of diabetic wounds was not reduced to the same extent
and the mean wound closure (%) calculated from the wound area is given
in Figure 7. On day
8, the process of wound closure in normal rats was significantly facilitated
by the films with mean wound closures of 70 ± 2, 60 ± 2,
and 55 ± 2% compared to diabetic wounds with mean closures of
30 ± 1, 20 ± 3, and 20 ± 2% for CMEG00, CMEG25, and
CMEG50, respectively (p < 0.001). In normal healthy
wounds, the skin regeneration required 16 days to form complete skin,
but wounds still persisted in the diabetic model at the same time
point. The mean wound closures (%) of diabetic wounds were 60 ±
2, 50 ± 3, and 48 ± 3% on day 16 (p <
0.001) for different films. From this, it is evident that CMEG00 showed
better wound healing in normal and diabetic wounds compared to blend
film. For both the normal and diabetic control groups, after surgery,
the unhealed area was higher and hair growth was comparatively slower
than in the membrane-treated wounds. However, a significant difference
between membrane-treated and -untreated was also noted. Normal wounds
treated with membranes healed completely, whereas wound still persisted
in the control.

and diabetic
(filled symbols) rats on days 8, 12, and 16 compared individually.
CMEG00, CMEG25, and CMEG50 films are represented as (◊), (□),
and (Δ) respectively.

Histopathological analysis provides the cellular and tissue-level
interpretations of the wound healing process. The wound sections (days
8 and 12) stained with haemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) are shown
in Figure 8. Generally,
on day 8 postwounding, the wound exhibited inflammatory response and
gradual granulation tissue formation and early collagen deposition.
On day 12, granulation tissue formation with the onset of collagen
remodeling was noted. In this study, on day 8 postsurgery, the untreated
normal and diabetic wounds were characterized with inflammation along
with the infiltration of neutrophils, whereas granulation tissue formation
was noted for film-treated wounds in both the rat models. On day 12
postwounding, the formation of granulation tissues like fibroblasts
was higher in the treated normal wound compared to the treated diabetic
wounds. Inflammation still persisted in both the controls as represented
by the presence of inflammation on day 12. Tissue formation is incomplete
for both the control groups. The diabetic control group shows higher
inflammation and necrosis compared to the normal control. The film-treated
normal wound showed enhanced reepithelialization than diabetic wound.

staining of the wound sections collected on days 8 and
12 in normal and diabetic rat models. Control group is untreated open
wounds, and experimental group is treated with three different films:
CMEG00, CMEG25, and CMEG50.

The formation of collagen is a very crucial step in wound
healing.
Skin wound sections stained with Masson’s trichrome to highlight
the formation of collagen bundles are shown in Figure 9. Newly formed collagen fibers can be identified
in film-treated normal and diabetic wounds compared to the control
groups on day 8. Collagen deposition with a typical wavy pattern of
collagen fibers was noted in normal wounds treated with films on day
12, whereas diabetic wounds exhibited lack of specific collagen fiber
organization. Irregular collagen formation with incomplete tissue
formation is noted for the control groups, and no improvement in wound
healing is observed for the diabetic control. The diabetic control
group shows the lowest rate of collagen synthesis and deposition.
The collagen deposition in film-treated groups is almost similar to
the findings in normal skin, thus representing enhanced skin regeneration
by the application of the films.38 Overall,
CMC-based films exhibit accelerated wound healing and more organized
tissue formation and collagen deposition at the wound site than the
blend films.

Discussion
To fabricate an appropriate
film for wound healing and skin regeneration
applications, different crucial aspects are considered, including
physicochemical, mechanical, morphological, and swelling properties,
degradability, cell cytotoxicity, and finally, in vivo accommodation.
Blending plays an important role in addressing the film structure
pattern, mechanical strength, fluid absorption capability, and degradability.
In this study, CMC and CMC/PEG blend films were prepared by solution
casting method. CMC films were characterized by XRD and FTIR to determine
the structural phases and specific information about chemical bonding
and molecular structure of CMC.

Thermal analyses, such as DSC
and TGA, described the behavior of
the films as a function of temperature and revealed the thermal transition,
degradation process, and thermal stability of these films. The shapes
of the thermograms for all of the films are identical; however, the
endothermic peaks of the blend films became less prominent than that
of the pure CMC films. The melting temperature depression for the blend films might be due to
the presence of PEG in CMC, resulting in interaction between the functional
groups of these two polymers.39 All of
the films exhibited steady degradation with the increase in heating
temperature. The present study yielded low values of tensile properties
of the films, although the tensile strength of skin is 1–100
MPa.40 The seeding of cells may lead to
strengthening of the films due to the secretion of extracellular matrix
by the cells.41

Swelling ability
has a prime significance in skin tissue engineering
to enable films to respond to varying pHs and absorb wound exudate
from the wound site. Healthy intact skin has acidic pH to regulate
bacterial flora to prevent infection. The occurrence of wound disturbs
the acidic milieu of skin, and the pH is disrupted, resulting in neutral
pH of the tissue lying underneath the epidermis. The successful skin
healing and reepithelialization help the skin to return to being acidic.
Wound exhibits neutral pH during the healing process, which includes
various factors like hypoxia and increased lactic acid formation.
An acidic pH environment is desired to facilitate fibroblast proliferation,
migration, and differentiation and also to prevent bacterial colonization.
Delayed wound healing oscillates the pH, which becomes alkaline over
time.42 Thus, it is important to study
the pH-responsive behavior of CMC in the physiological body fluid
of different pHs (from acidic to neutral range).

Swelling ability
is affected when the films come in contact with
external solution of different pHs. The effect of pH on swelling of
the films was investigated in Tris buffer in acidic and neutral range
of pH. The swelling ratio results showed that the films can serve
as an excellent matrix to facilitate absorption of a huge amount of
fluid. CMC films exhibited a higher swelling capability than the blends,
and the swelling ability decreased with increase in PEG concentrations.
The swelling ratio of the films was lower in acidic region (pHs 2.0
and 5.0) and was found to be higher at the neutral pH. These results
can be correlated to the swelling ratio of pure CMC hydrogel with
and without cross-linking, which showed a very small intake of fluid
in a lower pH range and exhibited sufficient fluid uptake at higher
pH. The uptake of water was pH-dependent, and the phenomenon is fully
governed by protonated (COOH) hydrogen bond present in CMC. The polysaccharide
chain without blend is not confined to any network, and COO– moieties (fixed negative charge) result in chain stiffening, thus
initiating a large molecule of water absorption. CMC is an excellent
adsorbent hydrogel, whose swelling behavior is notably influenced
by the appreciable amount of CMC content in the films.30 It is also noted that the swelling ratio of
the films in Tris–HCL buffer increased from acidic region to
the neutral region. The low swelling ability in acidic region can
be due to COO– occupation of CMC by protonation
in the buffer. This results in repulsive forces between carboxylate
ions, thus resisting association with water through hydrogen bonding.43 Generally, carboxylic group ionizes at higher
pH, resulting in deprotonation. With the increase in pH of Tris buffer,
the carboxylic group present in CMC ionizes, which generates anionic
charged polymer chains due to self-repulsion of carboxylate ions,
resulting in network chain expansion and leading to an increase in
swelling.

Blood–material interaction is a key host reaction
that occurs
during implantation of a biomaterial. In this study, blood–material
interaction was accounted by the deposition of blood cells and platelets
on the prepared films. From wound healing perspective, deposition
of blood cells on a biomaterial is defined as provisional matrix formation.
Such matrix furnishes cellular components to initiate wound healing
and reaction with foreign bodies. It directly influences and activates
substances that are capable of macrophage activity modulation along
with proliferation of cells in wound healing responses.44 Hemocompatibility test is regarded as a simple,
reliable, and effective method to measure material’s hemostatic
potentials. The interaction between cellular components and the films
may lead to the damage of cells. These interactions can rupture the
blood cells and the condition can be fatal; thus, blood–film
interaction in terms of hemocompatibility test was conducted. The
control sample showed 0.10% hemolysis. Generally, a biomaterial should
yield at least 2% hemolysis.45 The hemolytic
potentials of CMEG00, CMEG25, and CMEG50 are 0.06, 0.10, and 0.12%
and the values are <0.14%, which exhibited negligible hemolytic
property according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM
F756-00, 2000). In addition, the cell viability results indicated
that the fibroblast cells were viable and proliferated normally in
the presence of film extracts, thus confirming film benefits for cell
growth.

The efficiency of the films to treat full-thickness
normal and
diabetic wounds in rats was also evaluated. The wound healing process
can be classified into three overlapping stages: inflammation, proliferation,
and tissue regeneration. The films were not removed from the wound
site during in vivo experiment. The films were expected to degrade
at the wounded region, which is also an important factor in influencing
new tissue formation.46 The application
of films on the wound site increased the wound healing rate. The wound
was smaller and the reepithelialization propensity was higher in rats
treated with pure CMC films than the blends and the control. A study
by Lee et al. indicated that the acceleration of open full-thickness
wound healing is observed with layered chitosan-based hydrogel treatment,
which occurred in 21 days.47 Findings on
wound healing efficacy of CMC scaffolds suggested that these scaffolds
demonstrated reduction in partial-thickness wound size and gained
full reepithelialization in 22 days.48 The
prepared films required shorter duration to achieve complete reepithelialization
of the normal as well as diabetic wounds. The speedy recovery of wound
can be due to the presence of CMC polymer in the films. CMC might
have favored neutrophil accumulation at the wound site without inducing
further inflammation. These results can be correlated to the one-step
procedure application of meshed autograft/commercially available Integra,
silver nylon, Biobrane and Vaseline gauzes in facilitating wound closure
within 6–19 days in rat model and also macroporous waterborne
polyurethane/chitosan hydrogel scaffolds, which required 21 days for
complete wound recovery in rat model.49,50

The
most common histopathology methods, H&E and Masson’s
trichrome staining, were used to assess the formation of granulation
tissue and collagen during the wound healing process. The histopathological
analysis revealed that the neutrophils infiltrated at the site of
the skin wound. Accumulation of excess neutrophils had a direct influence
on the reduction of wound closure rate.51 When the neutrophil inflammation declines, macrophages approach
toward the wound site and refill the wound. At the same time, the
epidermis surrounding the edges of the wound allows epithelial cell
migration, resulting in the onset of reepithelialization.52 The major role of epidermis is to prevent loss
of water and to minimize the exposure to potential bacterial infection.53 Generally, full-thickness skin wound is difficult
to heal and is characterized by scar even after complete healing.
On the other hand, complete diabetic wound closure is difficult to
achieve as such healing process is very complex and involves changes
in vascularization, immune and biomechanical functions, and neuropathy.54,55 Thus, appropriate material is highly desirable to meet the need
of rapid wound closure by promoting wound healing and scar reduction.
The wound covering by the films decreased hemorrhage and exudation
at the wound site. In the middle stage, granulation tissues containing
fibroblasts and new capillaries formation were observed in all of
the film-treated normal and diabetic wounds, which were not prominent
in the control groups. In the later stage, collagen fiber formation
is observed, which further accelerated the wound healing process.
The collagen deposition in film-treated normal wounds was found to
be more organized than that in film-treated diabetic wounds. Application
of films at the wound site did not interrupt the process of wound
healing, instead, potentially accelerated healing by inhibiting neutrophil
infiltration and promoting reepithelialization. These results agree
with the results obtained by utilizing one of the most important polymers
used for wound healing, i.e., chitosan. Chitosan fosters sufficient
granulation tissue formation accompanied by deposition of thin collagen
fibers. The prepared films showed similar results like chitosan dressings.
CMC-based films kept the wounds moist and also encouraged granulation
tissue growth and reduced the formation of scar. The films contain
polysaccharide chain, which promotes wound healing by providing moist
environment around the wound, favoring tissue granulation to achieve
hemostasis. CMC films might absorb wound fluid by ion exchange. This
can promote granulation tissue formation, rapid epithelialization,
as well as healing, resulting in increase of healing time and quality
with polysaccharide-based films. It can be assumed that the faster
wound healing with the films is nearly related to polymer degradation
at the wound site, which could stimulate aggregation of inflammatory
cells and promote migration of epithelial, vascular endothelial, and
fibroblast cells, leading to a significantly higher and accelerated
wound healing of films than the control groups. The systemic histopathological
analysis provided evidence directly to improve the understandings
of the efficacy of the CMC-based films, thus encouraging further research
and utility of such films.

Thus, the prepared films can be considered
as potential biomaterials
due to their crystalline morphology, high swelling capability, biodegradability,
good cytocompatibility, and fibroblast and collagen production characteristics.
Generally, natural polymers like chitosan, collagen, and gelatin are
often cross-linked or blended with PVA, PEG, and PCL to improve the
various characteristic properties of the materials. In this study,
it is also evident that pure CMC films exhibit enhanced properties
in all terms than the blends, which suggests the potential of CMC
to be used alone without any additives or cross-linkers as a unique
polymer matrix for critical chronic wound healing applications.

Conclusions
In the present study, CMC and CMC/PEG blend films were prepared
by solution-casting method as wound dressings. The films were characterized
by different techniques to establish them as suitable templates as
wound healing materials. The XRD and FTIR analyses confirmed the purity
of CMC in the films and showed the crystalline property of CMC. The
films are pH-responsive and exhibit low to high swelling ratio over
a considerable range of pH (2.0, 5.0, and 7.0). The films are found
to be hemocompatible with less than 2% hemolysis. These films are
noncytotoxic and support fibroblast cell proliferation. The wound
healing process using normal and diabetic rats indicated that pure
CMC films are more effective in healing wounds than the blends, but
all of the films have the capability to accelerate the wound healing
process. The histopathological study showed that the films can promote
reepithelialization by the formation of granulation tissue and collagen
synthesis at the wound site. Overall, the prepared films can serve
as an excellent template for successful tissue regeneration in skin
tissue engineering application.

Experimental Section
Materials
Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (viscosity:
250–450 cps), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (MW, 4000 Da), phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) powder, Tris buffer powder, hydrochloric acid, streptozotocin,
sodium citrate, hematoxylin, and eosin (2% w/v) were purchased from
HiMedia, India. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM),
thiazolyl blue tetrazolium blue (MTT), dimethyl sulfoxide, and Masson’s
trichrome stain kit were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Penicillin
and streptomycin were received from Biochrom AG, Germany.

Preparation
of Films
CMC and CMC/PEG blend films were
prepared by solution casting method. CMC solution (2.5 wt %) and different
concentrations of PEG (0.025% and 0.05% w/v) were mixed to form a
polymer blend. The polymer blend solutions were homogenized at room
temperature for 30 min and filtered to remove the air bubbles trapped
inside the viscous solutions. The solutions were cast in a mold and
transferred into an hot-air oven preset at a temperature of 40 °C.
After 72 h of complete drying, the films were removed and stored in
a desiccator. The films are named as CMEG00, CMEG25, and CMEG50, where
the last two digits indicate the amount of PEG used.

Characterization
of the films
X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD study
was done using an
X-ray diffractometer (GE Inspection, XRD 3003TT, Germany) to examine
the crystalline nature of films, with a monochromatic Cu Kα
(λ = 1.54 A°) The X-ray source was operated at 40 kV, scanned
in the 2θ range of 10–70° with a step size of 0.02/s.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
The
chemical compositions of the films were characterized using a Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometer (IRA Shimadzu, Japan) equipped
with ZnSe cell/crystals by identifying the functional groups of CMC
and PEG. All of the spectra were recorded within a range of 4000–400
cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

Thermal Characterization
The glass-transition or crystalline
temperature of the polymer blends was determined using a differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC 204 Netzsch, Germany) from 25 to 500 °C
at a scanning rate of 10 K/min under nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal
properties of the films were analyzed by a thermogravimetric analyzer
(TGA, Q50V20.13 Build 39, TA Instruments) from 25 to 800 °C at
a constant heating rate of 10 K/min under a constant flowing nitrogen
atmosphere.

Tensile Test
The mechanical properties
of the films
were determined at room temperature using Texture Analyzer (CT V1.4
Build 17, Brookfield Engineering Labs, Inc.) under tensile mode. Specimens
of 50 × 5 mm size were applied with a trigger load of 5 g using
a load cell of 10 kg and a cross-head speed of 0.1 mm/s. The maximum
stress, tensile strength, and Young’s modulus were evaluated
from the stress–strain data at breaking yield point.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The surface morphology
of the films was examined using a scanning electron microscope (Carl
Zeiss, EVO 18 SEM, Germany) operated at 30 kV and at a working distance
of 6 mm. All of the films were coated with gold for 10 min under high
vacuum at 20 kV using a sputter coater (Cressington Sputter Coater,
108auto).

Effect of pH on Swelling Property
To study the effect
of pH on films swelling, the films were immersed in Tris–HCL
buffer (pHs 2.0, 5.0, and 7.0) at 37 °C for 12 h and the swelling
ratio (SR) was calculated using eq 1. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. 1  where wi is the
initial weight of the films in the dry state and wt is the weight of the swollen films.

Biological
Characterization
Hemocompatibility Test
Hemocompatibility
test was performed
to evaluate the interaction of blood cells with the films. Whole blood
was stored in polystyrene tubes preloaded with anticoagulant, citrate
phosphate, and dextrose solution to optimize the storage condition
of the blood cells. About 3 mL of anticoagulated blood was introduced
into the 10 mL polystyrene tubes containing the films. Then, 1 mL
of blood was taken out immediately from the tubes for blood cell count.
Percentage of hemolysis and plasma hemoglobin was measured by agitating
the remaining blood in contact with the films in an incubator for
30 min at 75 rpm in an environmental shaker thermostated at 37 °C.
Empty polystyrene tube exposed to blood was taken as control. The
experiment was performed in triplicate.

After 24 h, the films
in contact with blood were sterilized in ethanol solution for 30 min
and rinsed thoroughly with PBS (pH 7.4). The films were dried and
then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h to adhere and fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope.

Cytotoxicity Test
The cytotoxicity of the films was
evaluated by indirect dilution method by preparing extracts of the
films in DMEM and by treating with fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3) via
cell viability and MTT assays. Initially, the cells were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 units/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were added to the extracts at a density of
1 × 105/500 μL culture medium in each well in
a 24-well plate and incubated for 3 days to determine the cell viability
quantitatively using a cell viability autoanalyzer (Vi-CELL XR, Beckman
Coulter). For MTT assay, the MTT solution diluted with PBS was added
to the cell medium and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a 96-well
plate. The unreacted MTT solution was removed and dimethyl sulfoxide
was introduced to dissolve the accumulated formazan crystal giving
a purple solution. The absorbance of the colored solution was measured
at 570 nm using Elisa Microplate Reader (Multiscan Ex, Thermo Scientific)
in terms of cell viability (%).

In Vivo Full-Thickness
Wound Healing Study
To evaluate
the efficiency of the films for wound healing, full-thickness wounds
were created in male Wistar albino normal and diabetic rats. All of
the animal procedures were carried out in compliance with the experimental
protocols approved by Institute Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) of
Chettinad Hospital and Research Institute (CHRI), Chennai, India.
Diabetes was induced in rats using a single dose of intraperitoneal
injection of 60 mg/kg streptozotocin dissolved in saline-sodium citrate
buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.5). The blood glucose level was monitored using
a blood glucose monitor (Accu-Check) at regular time periods. The
rats showing blood glucose level >200 mg/dL were considered diabetic.
Diabetes was maintained in rats throughout the experiment by feeding
glucose to them.

For surgical procedure, the animals were anesthetized
with halothane, placed in prone position, and the hair from the dorsal
region was shaved using a razor blade. A circular full-thickness wound
(1 cm diameter) was created on the dorsum of each rat. The wounds
in normal healthy and diabetic wounds were treated with CMEG00, CMEG25,
and CMEG50 and compared to the untreated group. The films were applied
only once and wound closure was measured at specific time points.
All measures were taken to minimize pain during the surgical procedures,
and at the end of the study, the rats were euthanized by halothane
inhalation to collect the skin at closed wounds for histopathological
analysis.

Macroscopic Evaluation of Wound Healing
The surface
of the wound area was photographed using a digital camera (Nikon Coolpix
A10) on the day of wound incision, days 0, 8, and 16, and the wound
size profile in terms of wound closure (%) was calculated by the equation.  

Histopathology
For histological analysis, the wounds
were excised from rats after euthanizing them on days 8 and 12 and
fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution. After fixation, the specimens
were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in paraffin. The specimens
were sectioned at 4 μm using microtome and stained with hematoxylin–eosin
(H&E) for the assessment of cell morphology and proliferation,
and with Masson’s trichrome stain to visualize collagen matrix
formation at the wound site.

Statistical Analysis
The experimental data for maximum
stress, Young’s modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and swelling
ratio are reported as mean ± SD and analyzed by one-way ANOVA,
followed by Tukey’s post-test for attaining statistical significance.
GraphPad Prism v5.01 was used to find statistical significance, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
