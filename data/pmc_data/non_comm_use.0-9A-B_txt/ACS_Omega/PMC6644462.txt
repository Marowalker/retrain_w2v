Colloidal
CdSe quantum dot (QD) phosphors have attracted considerable
attention as green and red phosphors for blue backlight downconversion
in next-generation liquid-crystal displays because of their excellent
emission features including tunable emission wavelength and narrow
emission bands. Alternatives to CdSe, which do not contain toxic cadmium,
are strongly desired to ensure safety and reduce the environmental
load of consumer products. Herein, we synthesized colloidal Zn(Te,Se)/ZnS
core/shell QDs and demonstrated narrow-band green photoluminescence
(PL) emission. A full width at half-maximum of 30 nm was achieved
for PL emission at 535 nm from Zn(Te0.77Se0.23)/ZnS core/shell QDs with a core QD diameter of 4.3 nm. This emission
characteristic was as good as that of CdSe QDs.

1 Introduction
Colloidal semiconductor
quantum dots (QDs) exhibit excellent luminescence
properties, such as narrow emission bands arising from exciton recombination
and controllable emission energy owing to quantum size effects.1 Because of these features, QDs are expected to
have applications in various light-emitting devices, such as light-emitting
diodes (LEDs)2,3 and electroluminescent devices.4,5 Although light-emitting devices based on QDs are still under development,
QDs are currently being used as phosphors for blue LED backlight downconversion
in commercial liquid-crystal displays (QD-LCDs).6−8 Because the
QD phosphors enable the realization of a wide color range and excellent
energy efficiency, they are suitable to the next-generation displays,
responding to the switching from full-high-definition to ultrahigh-definition
television broadcasts. In current QD-LCDs, colloidal CdSe QDs are
used as green and red phosphors because of their narrow-band emission.
The full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of their emission bands is typically
less than 40 nm, and high quantum efficiencies (photoluminescence
quantum yield, PLQY) are achievable (>85%).6,9,10 However, cadmium is a toxic element and
its use is highly restricted to <100 ppm Cd in products sold in
many countries, based on laws such as the RoHS directive in countries
of the European Union.11 Cadmium-free QD
phosphors, which exhibit green and red emission, are highly desirable
for ensuring the safety of QD-LCD consumer products. InP QDs are a
promising alternative to CdSe QDs; however, InP QDs have not yet managed
to replace CdSe QDs because their PLQY and emission bandwidth remain
unsuitable for practical applications.9 CuInS2-based QDs have also emerged as nontoxic alternatives.12−14 The II–VI-based chalcogenides are easier to synthesize than
III–V pnictides because the source materials of group VI elements
are more stable and easier to handle than those of group V elements
and high PLQYs have been achieved.14 However,
broadband emission (fwhm = 80–120 nm) of CuInS2-based
QDs, arising from the electron–phonon interaction of the electron–hole
pair recombination via defect levels, is a serious disadvantage for
display applications.15,16

ZnTe, which exhibits the
smallest band gap (2.25 eV) among cadmium-free
and II–VI binary semiconductors, is not applicable as a green
QD phosphor because its band gap is too large. A method to form ZnTe/ZnSe
core/shell QDs was previously reported in order to realize green and
red emissions from ZnTe-based QDs. Because ZnTe and ZnSe form type-II
quantum well structure, the effective optical gap of the ZnTe/ZnSe
core/shell QDs is smaller than that of both ZnTe core and ZnSe shell.
As a result, ZnTe/ZnSe core/shell QDs exhibit visible emission ranging
from red to blue dependent on the thickness of the ZnSe shell. Bang
et al. reported visible emission ranging from blue to red of ZnTe/ZnSe
core/shell QDs with 30–50 nm of fwhm and 2–6% of PLQY,17 and Fairclough et al. also reported on the ZnTe/ZnSe
core/shell QDs that exhibit visible emission ranging from blue to
green with ∼30 nm of fwhm and 12% of PLQY.18 Because the electron and hole in the type-II core/shell
QDs are spatially separated, the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of
type-II core/shell QDs is longer than that of the conventional type-I
core/shell QDs, in which both the electron and hole are confined in
the core region.17,18 This feature of type-II core/shell
QDs is favorable for the photovoltaic application because the electron–hole
pair recombination can be avoidable but is generally not suitable
to light emission device applications required for fast response and
bright emission.

Recently, we have theoretically proposed another
approach to realize
green and red emissions of ZnTe-based QDs.19 In that approach, the optical gap of ZnTe QDs is tuned at the smaller
energy range by alloying with ZnSe or ZnS. The energy band gap of
an alloyed semiconductor is generally adjusted at approximately a
mole fraction weighted mean of the energy band gaps of the constituent
unalloyed materials; however, in Zn(Te,Se) and Zn(Te,S) alloys, the
energy band gap of the alloys deviates downward considerably from
the mole fraction weighted mean and exhibits a much smaller energy
band gap than that of ZnTe. In particular, while the energy band gaps
of ZnTe, ZnSe, and ZnS are, respectively, 2.25, 2.72, and 3.83 eV,
the minimum energy band gaps of the Zn(Te,Se) and Zn(Te,S) alloys
are reported to be 2.03 eV at Zn(Te0.63Se0.37)20 and 1.90 eV at Zn(Te0.68S0.32), respectively.21 While
the colloidal Zn(Te,S) alloy QDs have not been reported so far, colloidal
Zn(Te,Se) alloy QDs have been synthesized and their optical properties
have been reported by some groups. However, green emission from Zn(Te,Se)
alloy QDs has received less attention because the previous studies
focused on a narrow composition range in Se-rich side in order to
realize blue emission,22,23 although the smallest band gap
in the Zn(Te,Se) alloys appears in Te-rich compositions.24−26 Very recently, our group experimentally demonstrated that Zn(Te1–xSex)
QDs with diameters of 3.5–5 nm and x ≈
0.35 are promising as green QD phosphors;27 however, green PL emission from Zn(Te,Se) alloy QDs has yet to be
achieved.

Here, we report green PL emission from Zn(Te,Se)/ZnS
core/shell
QDs with a type-I quantum well structure.28 Fwhm was 30 nm for PL emission at 535 nm from Zn(Te0.77Se0.23)/ZnS core/shell QDs with a mean core QD diameter
of 4.3 nm. This emission characteristic is as good as that of CdSe
QDs. Our study demonstrates great potential for replacing CdSe-based
green QD phosphors in QD-LCDs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS Core/Shell QDs
Figure 1a,b shows
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the Zn(Te1–xSex) QDs before and after
ZnS shell formation. For the Zn(Te1–xSex) QDs before ZnS shell formation
(blue lines), all the diffraction peaks observed were identified as
those from the zinc blende structure, and no impurity phase formation
was observed. The diffraction peaks were considerably broadened because
of the small crystallite size. After ZnS shell formation (red lines),
no ZnS phase was detected, indicating that ZnS did not precipitate
separately during ZnS shell formation. The results of inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES) analyses
of typical Zn(Te1–xSex) QDs before and after ZnS shell formation (Table 1) clearly indicate
that a decent amount of sulfur was contained in the QDs after ZnS
shell formation. In the optical absorption spectra of the Zn(Te0.77Se0.23) QDs before and after ZnS shell formation
(Figure 2), the absorption
shoulder corresponding to the optical gap of the QDs exhibited a slight
red shift after the ZnS shell formation. This effect is commonly observed
in core/shell QDs and suggests successful ZnS shell formation owing
to the leakage of electron and hole wave functions from the QD core
into the shell.10,29 These XRD, ICP–AES, and
optical absorption results strongly suggest that ZnS was precipitated
only on the surfaces of the Zn(Te1–xSex) QDs and that Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS core/shell QDs
were successfully obtained. The thickness of the ZnS shell estimated
based on ICP–AES was approximately 0.2 nm (Table 1).

Figure 3 shows the
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of shallow core levels
and Se 3p and S 2p regions of Zn(Te1–xSex) QDs before and after ZnS shell
formation. In the shallow core-level spectra of Zn(Te0.73Se0.27) QDs with a diameter of 3.8 nm (Figure 3a), while the signals attributed
to Zn, Te, and Se are clearly observed in the spectrum of the QDs
before ZnS shell formation, the relative intensities of the signals
attributed to Te and Se after ZnS shell formation are reduced as compared
to the signal attributed to Zn. Because the XPS signals are surface-sensitive,
this observation indicated that the concentrations of Te and Se surfaces
were reduced after ZnS shell formation. In the spectra of Se 3p and
S 2p regions (Figure 3b), while Se 3p signals that are split by the spin–orbit coupling
were clearly seen in the spectrum before ZnS shell formation, only
a S 2p signal appeared after ZnS shell formation, indicating that
the surfaces of the QDs were covered by ZnS similar to the previous
studies on the formation of a ZnS shell on ZnSe QDs.30,31 In the spectra of Zn(Te0.77Se0.23) QDs with
a diameter of 6.6 nm (Figure 3c,d), there was a similar spectral change in the shallow core
level and Se 3p and S 2p regions; therefore, we safely concluded that
the ZnS shell was formed on Zn(Te1–xSex) QDs and that Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS core/shell QDs
were successfully obtained.

Figure 4 shows high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the QDs before
and after ZnS shell formation: Zn(Te0.77Se0.23) with a diameter of 3.5 nm (Figure 4a), Zn(Te0.77Se0.23) with a diameter
of 4.3 nm (Figure 4b), and Zn(Te0.74Se0.26) with a diameter of
6.2 nm (Figure 4c).
The small QDs were almost spherical (Figure 4a), but larger QDs exhibited slightly faceted
surfaces (Figure 4c).
The particle size distributions determined from those images indicated
that the average diameter increased by 0.1–0.6 nm by the ZnS
shell formation. Hence, the shell thickness was 0.05–0.3 nm
that is consistent with that estimated from chemical analysis (Table 1).

2.2 Optical
Properties of Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS Core/Shell QDs
Figure 5a shows
optical absorption (blue lines) and PL spectra (red lines) of Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS
core/shell QDs with x = 0.13, 0.23, and 0.39 and
core diameters of 4.3 ± 0.1 nm. The absorption shoulder indicated
by a black triangle corresponds to the first exciton peak, that is,
the optical gap of the QDs. This peak shifted to longer wavelengths
as the Se concentration in the core QDs x was increased.
The optical gaps of the alloyed QDs covered wavelengths from 521 to
502 nm, which is slightly shorter than the green wavelength range
recommended in BT.2020.32 By varying the
size of the core Zn(Te0.77Se0.23) from 3.5 to
6.2 nm in Zn(Te0.77Se0.23)/ZnS QDs, the optical
gap was controlled from the wavelengths of 493 to 540 nm (Figure 5c) owing to quantum
size effects. Although weak and broad and defect-related PL emission
at >600 nm appeared in some QDs, the Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS core/shell QDs
exhibited
narrow PL emission bands (red lines in Figure 5a,c) at wavelengths just longer than that
of the absorption shoulder. A small Stokes shift of approximately
110 meV was observed for the QDs with core diameters of 4.3 ±
0.1 nm (Figure 5b)
and 78–135 meV for Zn(Te0.77Se0.23)/ZnS
QDs with core diameters of 3.5–6.2 nm (Figure 5d). Furthermore, the small fwhms of the PL
emissions ranged from 30 to 37 nm (Table 2), which suggested that the emission arose
from electron–hole pair recombination, not involving deep defect
levels, that is, exciton recombination in Zn(Te,Se) core QDs. Although
the PLQYs of the materials were less than 1% at present, it should
be noted that the excellent narrow-band emission exhibited was as
good as that of CdSe QDs.6,9,10 Hence, the green emission of the present QDs, as observed in Figure 5e, is promising for
realizing a wide color range in QD-LCDs that are free from toxic cadmium.

On the basis of the ICP–AES and HRTEM
observation, the average
ZnS shell thickness is approximately 0.2 nm, corresponding to almost
0.5 monolayers. According to a previous study on CdSe/ZnS core/shell
QDs, 0.5 monolayers of a ZnS shell can reasonably passivate surface
states and increase the PLQY up to several tens of percent.29 Because the Zn(Te,Se) QDs before ZnS shell formation,
that is, the bare Zn(Te,Se) QDs, did not exhibit PL emission as previously
reported,27 the ZnS shell likely passivated
some surface states that behaved as nonradiative recombination centers;
however, the PLQYs of the present core/shell QDs were less than 1%.
The ZnS shell did not fully passivate the surface states of the core
Zn(Te,Se) QDs for the following reasons: first, the ZnS shell did
not completely and homogeneously cover the core Zn(Te,Se) surfaces
because the shell thickness is too small. Owing to the large lattice
mismatch between the Zn(Te1–xSex) core and the ZnS shell, in the range between
11% for x = 0.13 and 9% for x =
0.39, the ZnS shell formation on the Zn(Te1–xSex) surfaces likely developed
through island growth. Considering the very thin average shell thickness
of 0.2 nm, the island growth likely resulted in partial coverage of
the core surfaces. Even when the ZnS shell covered the whole Zn(Te,Se)
core surface, the grain boundaries of the ZnS shell crystals likely
acted as nonradiative recombination centers. Second, partial oxidation
of the core Zn(Te,Se) surfaces generated interfacial states between
the Zn(Te,Se) and the oxidized regions, and the interfacial states
behaved as nonradiative recombination centers. In the present shell
formation, the core Zn(Te,Se) QDs were once extracted from solution
and were then distributed in organic solvent again. Because ZnTe is
easily oxidized,33 partial oxidation of
the core Zn(Te,Se) surfaces likely occurred before ZnS shell formation.
These situations are schematically illustrated in Figure 6. In addition to these two
reasons, the band offset between Zn(Te,Se) and ZnS might be related
with the small PLQY of the Zn(Te,Se)/ZnS core/shell QDs. According
to the natural band offset between ZnTe and ZnS, ZnTe and ZnS form
a type-I quantum well structure, and the confining potentials for
the electron and hole are, respectively, 0.22 and 1.36 eV in the ZnTe/ZnS
core/shell QDs.28 Because the energy band
gap of bulk Zn(Te1–xSex) with x = 0.2–0.3 is approximately
0.15 eV smaller than that of ZnTe,20 the
confining potentials for the electron and hole in the Zn(Te,Se)/ZnS
core/shell QDs are expected to be slightly larger than those in the
ZnTe/ZnS core/shell QDs. However, the confining potential for the
electron in the Zn(Te,Se)/ZnS core/shell QDs, which is inferred to
be 0.2–0.3 eV, is much smaller than that for CdSe/ZnS core/shell
QDs, where the confining potential for the electron is 1.15 eV.28 Such a small confining potential for the electron
in the Zn(Te,Se)/ZnS core/shell QDs should introduce that a significant
portion of the electron wave function in the Zn(Te,Se) core region
penetrates into the ZnS shell layer and reaches to the surface of
the ZnS shell. In this situation, the surface states on the ZnS shell
layer should behave as nonradiative recombination centers and reduce
the PLQY of the Zn(Te,Se)/ZnS core/shell QDs. The much thicker ZnS
shell is required in order to eliminate the effect of surface states
of the ZnS shell.

Figure 7 shows time-resolved
PL emission decay traces of the Zn(Te0.77Se0.23)/ZnS core/shell QDs for core QDs with a diameter of 4.3 nm. Triple
exponential functions were required to fit the observed decays, and
the fitting suggested components with lifetimes of 0.6, 3.9, and 20
ns (Table 3). The lifetimes
for the three components are close to those previously reported for
CdSe and CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs and indicate that the PL emission
is not attributable to defect levels. The origin of PL decay components
in CdSe-based QDs is a topic of discussion; however, the short lifetime
component (τ < 1 ns) is related to surface states.34 In the present Zn(Te0.77Se0.23)/ZnS core/shell QDs, the pre-exponential factor of the shortest
lifetime component, A1 in Table 3, suggested that almost half
of the radiative recombination was related to surface states. This
result supports that the surface states of the core Zn(Te0.77Se0.23) QDs were not sufficiently passivated by the ZnS
shell as described above.

Improving
the PLQY is a major challenge for enabling the practical
application of the present QDs. In the case of InP/ZnS core/shell
QDs, aliovalent elements, that is, group II Zn and group VI S, are
deposited onto an InP core, consisting of group III and V elements.
Hence, interfacial electronic defects are likely to form between the
InP core and the ZnS shell, and the PLQY cannot be easily improved.
Recently, the PLQY of green emission from InP QDs was improved up
to 85% with the use of an InP/GaP/ZnS core/shell/shell structure,35 in which the density of interfacial defects
at the core–shell interfaces must be reduced because InP and
GaP are both III–V semiconductors. Unlike the InP/ZnS core/shell
QDs, the Zn(Te1–xSex) and ZnS in our Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS core/shell QDs are both
II–VI semiconductors; therefore, the Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS core/shell QDs
are free from interfacial electronic defects, except for stress-induced
dislocation caused by lattice mismatch. Therefore, the small PLQY
of the present Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS core/shell QDs is concluded to arise from the
very small thickness of the ZnS shell and/or partial oxidation of
the Zn(Te1–xSex) core. Thus, the PLQY of our Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS core/shell QDs might be
expected to be increased more easily by modifying the formation process
for the ZnS shell on the Zn(Te1–xSex) alloy QDs.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, a colloidal solution of Zn(Te,Se)/ZnS
core/shell
QDs was synthesized, and their optical properties were studied. Although
the PLQYs of the core/shell QDs require further improvements, we observed
narrow-band green emission, that is, a fwhm of 30 nm for PL emission
at 535 nm from Zn(Te0.77Se0.23)/ZnS core/shell
QDs. This feature is as good as that of CdSe QDs. The present study
demonstrates the great potential for replacing CdSe-based green QD
phosphors in QD-LCDs for blue backlight downconversion. Future work
will focus on forming high-quality and thick ZnS shells without oxidation
of the surfaces of core Zn(Te,Se) alloy QDs to improve the PLQY so
that cadmium-free and environmentally benign QD-LCDs can be developed
from Zn(Te,Se) alloy QDs and InP QDs as green and red phosphors, respectively.

4.2 Synthesis of Zn(Te1–xSex)/ZnS
Core/Shell QDs
A total of 34 μL of ZnEt2 and 73 μL of DDT
were dissolved into 6 mL of ODE to prepare a ZnS source solution.
Next, 18 mg of Zn(Te1–xSex) QD powder, which was prepared based on a previously
reported method,27 was dispersed in a mixed
solution of 2.00 mL of TOP, 6.00 mL of ODE, and 1 mL of OLA in a flask.
Then, the solution was degassed under vacuum at 100 °C for 30
min. After the solution was heated up to 240 °C under argon flow,
the ZnS source solution was added dropwise to the solution in a flask
at a rate of 0.2 mL min–1. After the ZnS source
solution was completely added, the solution in the flask was kept
at 240 °C for 15 min; then, it was cooled to room temperature.

Powder samples were extracted from the product colloidal solution
as follows: 0.5 mL of hexane and 6 mL of acetone were added to 2 mL
of the product colloidal solution to aggregate the product QDs. Aggregated
QDs were isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting
powder was redispersed in 0.5 mL of hexane, and the QDs were again
aggregated by the addition of 6 mL of acetone. This was repeated several
times, and the resulting wet precipitate was dried in a vacuum desiccator
at room temperature.

4.3 Characterization
The crystalline
phases of the obtained core and core/shell QDs and the lattice parameters
of the core QDs were determined using powder XRD (Rigaku, RINT2500,
Cu Kα radiation). The average size, dXRD, was evaluated from the fwhm of the 111, 220, and 311 diffractions
of the zinc blende structure using the Scherrer equation36 1  where λ is the X-ray wavelength, β
is the fwhm, θ is the diffraction angle, and 0.9 is the shape
factor in bulk Zn(Te1–xSex) alloys with a zinc blende structure. Because the
lattice parameters of alloys agree well with Vegard’s law,37 that is, a mole fraction weighted mean lattice
parameter of the compounds, the chemical compositions, x, of the alloy QDs were determined from their lattice parameter at
a composition x, a(x), from the following equation27 2  

The chemical compositions of the alloy
QDs were also determined by ICP–AES (SPS7800, SII Nanotechnology,
Japan and Spectro ARCOS, AETEK Inc., U.S.). HRTEM images were collected
using a JEM-2010 microscope (JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV. Samples were prepared by depositing dilute QD solutions
in toluene on carbon-coated copper grids (EM Japan, 200 mesh) and
by drying under vacuum at room temperature. XPS spectra were recorded
using a PHI5600 spectrometer (ULVAC-PHI Inc., Japan) with a hemispherical
electron analyzer. Monochromated Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) was used as an excitation source. The QDs were
distributed onto an indium plate and subjected to the XPS measurements.
The binding energy was calibrated based on the assumption that the
C 1s binding energy for the contaminant carbon is 284.6 eV.

For the optical measurements, the QDs dispersed in chloroform were
loaded into a 10 mm pathlength SiO2 glass cuvette. The
optical absorption spectra were recorded using a double beam spectrophotometer
(U4100, Hitachi, Japan), and the PL spectra were acquired using a
blue diode-pumped solid-state laser (Shanghai Sanctity Laser Technology
Co., Ltd., P. R. China) with an excitation source of 473 nm, recorded
using a USB2000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USA). The PLQYs of the
core/shell QDs were evaluated using a PL spectrometer (FP6500, JASCO,
Japan) with a xenon discharge lamp from the integrated PL intensity
of the colloidal solution of core/shell QDs using Rhodamine B as a
standard.

Time-resolved PL emission decay traces of the as-synthesized
colloidal
solution of core/shell QDs were recorded using a time-correlated single-photon
counting system comprising a pulsed picosecond diode laser operating
at a wavelength of 375 nm (PLP-10-038, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan),
a monochromator (Acton SP2150, Princeton Instruments, USA), a photosensor
module equipped with a photomultiplier tube (H7422P-50, Hamamatsu
Photonics, Japan), and a photon-counting board (SPC-130, Becker and
Hickl, Germany).
