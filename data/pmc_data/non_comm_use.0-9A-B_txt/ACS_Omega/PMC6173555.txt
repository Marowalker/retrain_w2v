Fullerene–protein
interaction studies have been a key topic
of investigation in recent times, but the lower water solubility of
fullerene somewhat limits its application in the biological system.
In this work, we have compared the activities of fullerene and its
water-soluble hydrated form, that is fullerenol, on ribonuclease A
(RNase A) under physiological conditions (pH 7.4). The interaction
studies of fullerene and fullerenol with protein suggest that the
binding depends on the hydrophobic interactions between the protein
and the ligand. In addition, fullerene and fullerenol slow down the
ribonucleolytic activity of RNase A through noncompetitive and mixed
types of inhibition, respectively. This precisely gives the idea about
the ligand-binding sites in RNase A, which has further been explored
using docking studies. Both these nanoparticles show a reduction in
dityrosine formation in RNase A caused due to oxidative stress and
also prevent RNase A dimer formation to different extents depending
on their concentration.

1 Introduction
Nanoparticles
have found widespread applications in the field of
polymer science,1 green synthesis,2 electronics,3 and
also absorption of species, which would otherwise be harmful to health.4,5 Their contribution in the field of biology and medicinal chemistry
has highlighted their ever-increasing necessity as the nanometer-level
dimensions render them possible for use in monitoring cellular activities
at a minute scale.6 They find applications
in the field of fluorescent labeling,7 purification
of biomolecules,8 drug delivery,9 probing proteins and DNA,10,11 treatment of tumors,12 etc.

Fullerene
(Ful) is a carbon allotrope that can take the forms of
hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and other geometries, of which spherical fullerenes are buckyballs.
The smallest member of the buckyball family is C20, and
the most common member is C60 (buckminsterfullerene). The
cagelike structure of fullerenes has led to much focus on their properties (Figure 1). The production of fullerene-specific antibodies have shown
that they are capable of specific interactions with proteins.13 The widespread applications of fullerene in
biology are mainly due to the presence of significant interactions
with proteins in aqueous solution. Fullerenes and their derivatives
have been extensively explored for biomedical applications. Examples
of fullerene bioactivity include antibacterial activity,14 neuroprotection,15 DNA cleavage,16 apoptosis,17 ion channel inhibition,18 and inhibition of amyloid formation.19 Due to the high degree of unsaturation, the molecule is able to
effectively trap free radicals, thereby making it a radical sponge.20 In vivo studies on rats have shown that at moderate
concentrations fullerene increases the life span significantly without
any toxic effects.21 It shows nanomolar-level
affinity toward peptides, leading to the formation of fullerene-based
tetrameric helix bundles.22 Apart from
this, it shows fluorescence quenching in human serum albumin (HSA)
as well as significant perturbation in the chemical shift in the presence
of lysozyme.23,24 As a result, fullerene and its
derivatives have been utilized as inhibitors for certain proteins
like neuronal nitric oxide synthase,25 human
immunodeficiency virus protease,26 glutathione
reductase,27 and tyrosine phosphatases.28 Studies on fullerene are, however, limited due
to its poor solubility in aqueous medium. In aqueous solution, it
has a solubility of less than 10–9 mg/L with an
octanol–water partition coefficient log KOW of 6.67 and readily forms aggregates of nC60, thereby making it sparingly soluble in water.23

Figure 1 Structure of (a) fullerene and (b) fullerenol.

Several techniques are employed to make nanoparticles
soluble in
aqueous medium to exploit their biological properties. Generally,
carbohydrate-based compounds like chitosan and cyclodextrin have been
found to increase the solubility of nanoparticles for their use in
drug delivery and other biological applications.29,30 This laboratory has also reported methods to prepare protein-based
nanoparticles as well as poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid)-loaded nanoparticles to improve the solubility of bioactive
compounds.31,32 In this article, the focus is
on the development of water-soluble fullerene derivatives to investigate
their inhibitory and antioxidant abilities. Hydroxylated fullerenes,
generally known as fullerenols (FulOH), are commonly used water-soluble
fullerene derivatives. The solubility of these nanoparticles depends
on the number of OH (hydroxyl) groups attached to the fullerene unit
and is denoted C60(OH)x [x = number of hydroxyl groups attached]. Chiang et al. have
shown that fullerenols with 12 OH groups are not as soluble in water33 as C60(OH)22–2634 under neutral conditions. On the other
hand, higher fullerenol compounds prepared using H2O2 in the absence and presence of a phase-transfer catalyst
showed much improved solubility in water to about 17.5 mg/mL [C60(OH)36] and 64.9 mg/mL [C60(OH)44], respectively.35,36 The higher solubility
of fullerenol renders it possible to be used in biological systems
with almost negligible toxicity.37 The
unsaturated fullerene unit along with the large number of attached
−OH groups also makes fullerenol a better radical scavenger.
Polyphenolic compounds having several −OH groups are known
to possess high antioxidant activity as estimated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
assay.38 However, encapsulation of such
polyphenols using β-cyclodextrin has shown to increase the overall
solubility and prevent oligomerization of proteins caused due to oxidative
stress.39 Research on the antioxidant properties
of fullerenol showed its ability to quench the superoxide radical
generated in the presence of xanthine and xanthine oxidase,40 which further led to the scope for in vivo studies.
Fullerenol has the ability to increase the survival rates of mice
by quenching reactive oxygen species41 and
can also prevent the damage of A549 cells in the presence of H2O2 with much higher efficiency.42 The interaction of fullerenols with proteins has been studied
by Yang et al. with lysozyme using both experimental and theoretical
methods, where a high association constant was observed followed by
tryptophan (Trp) quenching.24 The protein
binding ability of fullerenol was further explored for studying the
enzymatic inhibition properties where it showed significant reduction
in enzymatic activity at high fullerenol concentrations. Detailed
studies on the enzyme (E) monooxygenase showed that fullerenol acts
as a noncompetitive and mixed-type inhibitor depending on the nature
of the substrate with Ki values at the
micromolar level.43 Wu et al. used docking studies to explore the interaction of fullerene and
fullerenol with different proteins. The results highlighted that the
extent of binding interactions between the protein and ligand depends
on the size of fullerene unit and number of OH groups attached.44 However, the study was restricted to theoretical
calculations only.

In the present work, fullerenol has been
prepared and the effect
of both fullerene and fullerenol on ribonuclease A (RNase A) has been
investigated experimentally using several spectroscopic studies. Ribonucleases
(RNases) are a group of enzymes that catalyze the degradation of RNA
into smaller components. RNases catalytically cleave RNA to maintain
an optimal level of balance in protein synthesis during the transcription
and translation processes. One of the most widely studied proteins
of this family is bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A45,46 (RNase A). Higher levels of RNases can lead to cytotoxic effects
by entering into the cell cytosol and preventing protein synthesis
by breaking down RNA, thereby causing cell death.47 Earlier reports from our laboratory have shown that polyphenols
like rutin and quercetin as well as green tea polyphenols like (−)-epicatechin
gallate (ECG) and (−)-epigallocatechin gallate have inhibitory
effects on RNase A.48,49

Because RNase A plays a
crucial role in protein synthesis, a proper
balance of this protein within our body is highly essential. Deficiency
of ribonucleases can lead to brain infection; thus, retention of enzyme
activity is equally important.50 Oxidative
stress is one of the main causes for protein damage caused due to
reactive free radical species.51 Out of
several modifications in amino acid residues occurring due to oxidative
stress, dityrosine (DT) formation is one such modification often found
in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, cataracts,
etc.52 Dityrosine (DT) formation can result
in intermolecular covalent bond formation between two Tyr residues
of different monomers, leading to a protein dimer.53 Because both fullerene and fullerenol have antioxidant
properties, these molecules have been used to study the changes in
DT formation caused due to oxidation of RNase A in the presence of
peroxide. The extent of dimer formation has been monitored using sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF).
The role of fullerene and fullerenol as an inhibitor as well as an
antioxidant molecule has also been explored. The number of binding
sites and Tyr fluorescence quenching using these two compounds have
been monitored to further understand protein–nanoparticle interactions.
In the present work, we investigated the interaction of fullerene
and fullerenol with RNase A and compared the extent of inhibition
of the ribonucleolytic activity of the protein.

2 Results
and Discussion
Fullerene and fullerenol have been characterized
using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and MALDI-TOF
along with microscopic techniques field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanoparticles
were initially used for interaction studies with RNase A, after which
their effects on the enzymatic action of the protein were investigated.
Due to their high radical quenching ability, both fullerene and fullerenol
were used to prevent the dityrosine (DT) formation in RNase A due
to oxidative stress.

2.1 Characterization of Aqueous
Suspension of
Fullerene and Fullerenol Prepared
2.1.1 UV–Vis
Studies
The UV–vis
spectra for both fullerene and fullerenol were measured in the range
of 200–600 nm. Fullerene gives two characteristic peaks, one
at around 340 nm and the other at around 260 nm, which changes slightly
depending on the degree of association of fullerene in water.54 In our present work, the concentration of fullerene
has been determined by taking the absorbance value at 347 nm (ε347 = 18 900 M–1 cm–1).55 Fullerenol, on the other hand, being
a clear and colorless solution, does not exhibit any characteristic
peaks like fullerene (Figure S1 in Supporting
Information).56

2.1.2 FTIR
Studies
Fullerene shows a
distinct peak at around 1647 cm–1, which is due
to the C=C stretching, whereas the other peaks around at 1400,
1153, 580, and 522 cm–1 are due to the IR-active
F1u modes of fullerene
C60.57 In the case of fullerenol, a sharp
peak of very high intensity at around 1107 cm–1 (corresponding
to C–O stretching) confirms the linking of hydroxyl groups
to the fullerene system along with C=C peaks at around 1618
cm–1 (Figure 2). The broad region 3415 cm–1 corresponds
to the −OH stretching in addition to −OH bending vibrations
at around 1446 cm–1 (in plane) and 987 cm–1 (out of plane).58,59

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of Fullerene and Fullerenol.

2.1.3 MALDI-TOF
Mass spectrometric analysis
(MALDI-TOF) of the fullerene sample gave a sharp, highly intense peak
at around 720 Da m/z, which is the
molecular weight for C60 fullerene (Figure S2 in Supporting Information).60 This suggests
that the aqueous suspension of fullerene is highly pure. MALDI-TOF
analysis of the fullerenol sample gave a distribution of peaks ranging
from 1.3 to 1.4 kDa m/z (Figure 3), indicating that
about 30–40 hydroxyl groups are present in the prepared sample
of fullerenol, thus contributing to its high solubility in aqueous
medium.61,62

of peaks within
1300–1400 m/z.

2.1.4 Morphology, Size, and
ζ Potential
Measurements
The morphology and size range of fullerene and
fullerenol were initially measured from field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both these microscopy
images showed that both fullerene and fullerenol particles form aggregates
in aqueous solution having somewhat spherical shapes (Figure S3 in Supporting Information). The FESEM
images show that the fullerene and fullerenol nanoparticles are almost
spherical in shape and have smooth surfaces. The average size distribution
of the nanoparticles in FESEM for fullerene is around 140–160
nm, and it increases to 230–250 nm for fullerenol. In both
the cases, larger sizes of the nanoparticles can be seen, which results
from aggregation of smaller particles.63 AFM also shows the presence of spherical nanoparticles in the system,
and the size distribution gives the sizes of the nanoparticles present
within the system. The sizes of fullerene nanoparticles from AFM are
around 150 nm and just over 250 nm for fullerenol nanoparticles. The
greater size of fullerenol may be due to the increase in size of the
pristine C60 due to addition of −OH groups. However, in AFM,
it can be seen that the fullerene nanoparticles are well distributed
and are separated from one another; however, the nanoparticles are
closely packed in the case of fullerenol. This may be due to the fact
that the −OH groups in fullerenol are involved in intermolecular
hydrogen bonding with neighboring fullerenol molecules, leading to
a closely associated structure. This may be manifested in the larger
fullerenol aggregates, which are closely packed, as seen in AFM images.
The size of the nanoparticles was also determined using dynamic light
scattering experiments. It was observed that the average size of the
fullerene nanoparticles was 158 ± 27.71 nm (Figure 4), which is close to that obtained
from AFM. Upon hydration, the average size of the fullerenol nanoparticles
increases by ∼50% to 237.5 ± 24.7 nm. The ζ potential
of fullerene solution in water at pH 7.4 was found to be −7.34
± 2.80 mV, and it decreases to −14.45 ± 1.90 mV for
fullerenol solution in water. The presence of −OH groups in
fullerenol may increase the negative charge density as compared to
that in fullerene, accounting for the decrease in the ζ potential
value.

2.2 Interaction Studies of Fullerene and Fullerenol
with RNase A
The interaction studies were carried out by
studying the Tyr fluorescence quenching in RNase A in the presence
of fullerene and fullerenol. RNase A exhibits fluorescence emission
at 304 nm on excitation at 278 nm due its tyrosine residues.64 The emission peak intensity decreases with an
increase in both fullerene and fullerenol concentrations in the solution
(Figure 5). However,
the decrease in intensity is much more significant in the case of
fullerene compared to that in fullerenol. From Table 1, it can be seen that the Ksv values for fullerene are ∼5 times higher than those for fullerenol. The
lower Ksv value for fullerenol suggests
that fullerene is able to quench the Tyr residue more effectively
than fullerenol. Although both nanoparticles bind to the protein in
a 1:1 ratio, the binding constant (Kb)
values indicate that the binding of fullerenol decreases by ∼34% in comparison to that of fullerene.
It may be concluded from the tyrosine quenching experiment that although
fullerene and fullerenol both bind to RNase A the binding sites are
different and fullerenol binds at a site further away from the Tyr
residue compared with fullerene.

Figure 5 Fluorescence quenching of RNase A in the
presence of fullerene
(0–10 μg/mL) and fullerenol (0–2 μg/mL).

Table 1 Binding Parameters
for Fullerene and Fullerenol with RNase A
 	Ksv, (g/mL)−1 × 104	Kb, (g/mL)−1 × 104	n	
fullerene	8.2 ± 0.65	5.3 ± 0.42	1.19	
fullerenol	1.7 ± 0.11	3.5 ± 0.13	1.09	
In the
presence of proteins, the sizes of the fullerene nanoparticles
increase to a significant extent as seen from DLS results (Figure S4 in Supporting Information). The average
size of fullerene increases by ∼42% (275.15 ± 28.5 nm)
and of fullerenol by ∼35% (369.05 ± 38.2 nm) in the presence
of RNase A at pH 7.4. This may be due to the fact that the protein
gets bound to the surface of the nanoparticles, which leads to the
increase in their size by a significant amount. Moreover, on addition
of RNase A to the nanoparticle solution, the overall charge on the
nanoparticles becomes almost neutral with the fullerene–protein
complex having a slightly higher positive charge (0.16 ± 0.01
mV) than that on fullerenol/protein complex (0.06 ± 0.01 mV)
at pH 7.4. RNase A is positively charged at pH 7.4 (pI 9.6) and attaches to the surface of the nanoparticles (as seen from
DLS studies), thereby reducing the negative charge on the nanoparticles.
Both these study signify that in the presence of protein, fullerene
and fullerenol bind with RNase A, which increases their size in solution,
and also, due to the higher pI of the protein (pI 9.6), the overall negative charge on the nanoparticles
decreases. Moreover, the increase in size for protein–fullerene
is higher as compared to that for protein–fullerenol. This
can be explained from the interaction studies, which show that the binding affinity
of fullerene is higher than that of fullerenol, which indicates that
in the system more number of RNase A can bind to the fullerene nanoparticle
than with fullerenol.

2.3 Inhibition Studies
2.3.1 Agarose Gel-Based Assay
The effect
of fullerene and fullerenol on RNase A was assayed qualitatively by
the degradation of t-RNA in an agarose gel-based assay. The extent
of degradation of t-RNA was estimated by observing the intensity of
stained ethidium bromide, as shown in Figure 6a. The ability of the ligand to affect the
enzyme activity is measured in terms of the extent of t-RNA degradation
from the differential intensity observed. Lane 2 displays degraded
t-RNA in the presence of RNase A, with intensity significantly decreased
with respect to that in lane 1 (only t-RNA). Lane 3 displays slightly
enhanced intensity compared with lane 2, indicating reduced degradation
of t-RNA in the presence of fullerene (Figure 6b). The intensity of lane 4 is higher than
that of lane 3, indicating that the extent of degradation is the least
in the presence of fullerenol. This suggests that both fullerene and
fullerenol inhibit the RNase A activity with fullerenol showing somewhat
greater inhibition compared with fullerene.

intensity in agarose gel; Lineweaver–Burk plot for (c) fullerene
(Ful) and (d) fullerenol (FulOH).

2.3.2 Inhibition Kinetics
The mode of
inhibition in RNase A by fullerene is noncompetitive, whereas for
fullerenol, it is of a mixed type, as shown in Figure 6c,d. The inhibition constant (Ki) value for fullerene is 26.49 ± 2.17 μg/mL,
and being a noncompetitive inhibitor, it binds to a region away from
the active site generally referred to as the allosteric site (Table 2). In the case of fullerenol, it can bind to the active site as well
as the allosteric site with a Ki value
of 4.66 ± 1.04 μg/mL. Both the nanoparticles significantly
lower the enzymatic activity of RNase A, with fullerenol being slightly
more effective compared with fullerene.

inhibitor	Ki (μg/mL)	type

fullerene	26.49 ± 2.17	noncompetitive	
fullerenol	4.66 ± 1.04	mixed type	
2.4 Docking Studies
Both fullerene and
fullerenol were optimized in Avogadro software. MALDI-TOF suggested
that the number of hydroxyl groups present in fullerenol ranges from
30 to 40. In our case, fullerenol was prepared by placing OH groups
in the equatorial position, which is considered to be the most stable,65 and 35 −OH groups were placed accordingly
and used for docking studies after optimization.

Autodock Vina
gives two probable positions for the attachment of both fullerene
and fullerenol with a slight difference in their −ΔG values. The two different modes of attachment of fullerene
and fullerenol are represented by fullerene-1/fullerene-2 and fullerenol-1/fullerenol-2,
respectively. It can be seen that Tyr115 lies within a distance of
0.5 nm from fullerene-1, whereas no Tyr residues are present near
the binding sites of both the fullerenols (Figure 7a). The results obtained show that −ΔG (free energy of binding) is higher in the case of fullerene
as compared to that in fullerenol despite the attachment of hydroxyl
groups to the latter (Figure 7b). This explains the higher Tyr quenching ability of fullerene
over fullerenol. The residues located close to fullerene-1 and fullerene-2
are mostly nonpolar (Ala, Leu, Val) and aromatic (Phe, Tyr), thereby
implying that the protein–ligand binding is stabilized by hydrophobic
interactions (Figure 8a). On the other hand, in Figure 8b, both the fullerenols are surrounded mostly by polar
residues (Lys, Arg), which might prevent any hydrophobic interaction,
thus reducing the extent of binding between the protein and the ligand.
The ∼25% decrease in free energy can be attributed to the lowering
in hydrophobic interactions, which has been studied earlier using
quantum mechanical calculations.66 The
lower interaction value for fullerenol can be correlated with the
binding energy obtained from Tyr fluorescence quenching studies, which
also showed a similar trend.

and fullerenol
in RNase A as obtained from AutoDock Vina. (b) Free energy of binding
for fullerene and fullerenol.

Figure 8 RNase A residues located within 0.5 nm distance from (a) fullerene
and (b) fullerenol.

Fullerenol-1 binds almost
directly with the active site residues
(His12, Lys41, His119), making it an effective inhibitor as compared
with fullerene, which lies slightly away from the active site. This
supports the experimentally obtained results for inhibition constant
values for fullerene and fullerenol, where Ki (fullerenol) < Ki (fullerene). Figure 9 gives a comparative
idea about the distance of fullerene-1 and fullerenol-1 from the Cα
backbone atom of three active site residues of RNase A. It has been
previously observed that the Lys41 residue in RNase A plays a vital
role during RNA cleavage by stabilizing the transition state through
hydrogen bond formation with the substrate.67,68 From Figure 8b, the
proximity of fullerenol-1 to Lys41 clearly indicates that the hydroxyl
groups of fullerenol may get associated with hydrogen bonding with
Nζ of Lys41, thereby preventing the amino acid from stabilizing
the transition state and finally reducing the enzyme activity. In
addition, both fullerene-2 and fullerenol-2 occupy a common binding
site, which is away from the active site of RNase A. Previous reports
from this laboratory have shown that noncompetitive inhibitors of
RNase A (like (−)-epicatechin, ECG) bind near residues like
Arg10, Asn34, Leu35, and Lys37.49 From Figure 9, it can be seen
that the nearby residues of fullerene-2 and fullerenol-2 are Arg10,
Arg33, and Asn34 and thus it can be stated that this region may be
the allosteric site for RNase A.

A in the docked structure.

2.5 Prevention of Dityrosine (DT) Cross-Linkage
in RNase A
The RNase A dimer obtained by treating pure RNase
A with K2S2O8 and Co(OAc)2, can be detected using dityrosine fluorescence, SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF.
RNase A upon treatment with oxidant shows an enhanced fluorescence
peak around 405 nm upon excitation at 317 nm which is absent in native
RNase A. The sulfate free radical produced abstracts one proton from
the tyrosine residue and forms a tyrosyl free radical which has been
reported earlier by using a radiolysis study.69 As a result two such tyrosyl free radicals formed from two different
protein molecules come close to one another leading to the formation
of a DT bond.

2.5.1 Inhibition of DT Fluorescence
To
check how fullerene and fullerenol affect the DT fluorescence, RNase
A samples were treated with fullerene and fullerenol prior to the
addition of K2S2O8 and Co(OAc)2. A significant decrease in the DT fluorescence intensity
was observed with an increase in the concentration of fullerene along
with a gradual blue shift from 403 to 400 nm (Figure 10a). The decrease in DT intensity suggests
that fullerene reduces the formation of dityrosine cross-linkage,
thereby acting as a potential inhibitor against oxidative stress.
The shift of around ∼3 nm in the peak intensity in the lower-wavelength region may be due to the fact that with an increase in the concentration
of the nanoparticles a significant population of fullerene molecules
comes close to the DT bond by replacing the water molecules around
it. Fullerene itself being highly hydrophobic decreases the polarity
around the DT bond, thereby causing the blue shift.70 In the case of fullerenol, the DT fluorescence intensity
decreases initially with an initial increase in concentration. However,
the DT intensity increases at a high concentration range of fullerenol
(10 μg/mL), indicating that fullerenol could have a tendency
to enhance oxidation and subsequent dimerization at high concentrations
(Figure 10b).71 In the case of fullerenol, no shift in emission
maximum is noticed with change in concentration. This difference from
fullerene can be explained on the basis of the extent of interaction
of these nanoparticles with Tyr residues. Interaction studies highlighted
that fullerene is able to quench the Tyr fluorescence more than fullerenol,
thus suggesting that the former is likely to be in a closer proximity
to the Tyr, as observed from docking studies. Thus, the population
of fullerenol near modified Tyr residues (DT bond) is expected to
be lower than fullerene due to which no such significant change in
the wavelength shift is observed for fullerenol.

concentrations of (a) fullerene and (b) fullerenol. Effect of (c)
fullerene and (d) fullerenol on dimer formation of RNase A upon oxidation.
Oxi: K2S2O8 + Co(OAc)2.

2.5.2 SDS-PAGE
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis was performed to investigate the effect of fullerene
and fullerenol on dimer formation. Figure 10c shows that with an increase in the concentration
of fullerene the dimer band intensity around 25 kDa decreases. A similar
observation was made for fullerenol (Figure 10d) except that at very high concentration
(10 μg/mL) the band intensity at 25 kDa did not show much decrease
and thus reinforcing the conclusions derived from the dityrosine (DT)
fluorescence experiment.

2.5.3 MALDI-TOF
The
observations in MALDI-TOF
analysis showed a peak at around 27.6 kDa for the RNase A dimer (monomer
peak at around 13.6 kDa) upon oxidation (Figure 11). On addition of fullerene (36 μg/mL)
and fullerenol (1.0 μg/mL), the dimer peak intensity decreases
significantly. This shows that both fullerene and fullerenol are effective
in preventing oxidation and subsequent dimerization of RNase A and
have potential antioxidant properties.

and fullerenol. Oxi: K2S2O8 + Co(OAc)2.

2.6 Relevance
of the Study
Both fullerene
and fullerenol show significant
interaction with RNase A under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) but
with a notable difference in the binding constant values. Fullerene
showed greater quenching in Tyr fluorescence compared with fullerenol,
which is highlighted from the Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv) values. Previous studies showed that attachment
of organophosphate groups to fullerene decreases the Ksv value compared to that for pristine fullerene in the
case of HSA, which suggests that the extent of quenching depends on
the functional group attached to the fullerene.23,72 Moreover, the extent of quenching for C60 is higher in
the case of Tyr (RNase A) than Trp (HSA), which shows that the mode
of interaction also depends on the protein residue.23

The binding constant for fullerene and fullerenol
is comparable to that for previously reported polyphenolic compounds
like rutin and quercetin with RNase A as well as their Cu complexes
(on the order 104 M–1).48 On the other hand, carboxy-functionalized fullerene showed
enhanced Kb values for HSA, which is about
103 times higher than that for fullerene or its hydrated
form for RNase A.73 Because the residues
present in the binding pocket differ from one protein to another,
the above comparison suggests that the extent of binding depends more
on the nature of the protein pocket than the interacting ligand. In
the present case, fullerene shows 1:1 binding with RNase A, whereas
attachment of carboxy group to fullerene increases the binding to
3:1 in the case of bovine β-lactoglobulin.74 On the other hand, fullerenol shows 1:1 binding in the
case of lysozyme, which is similar to our result for RNase A.24

The Ki value
shows that fullerenol
acts as a better inhibitor than fullerene for RNase A. This difference
can be attributed to the fact that Ki calculation
takes into consideration the attachment of the ligand with enzyme
(E) as well as the enzyme substrate complex, whereas in the case of Kd, the substrate concentration is not involved.
The presence of negatively charged oxygen atoms in fullerenol assists
the approach to the active site, thereby showing greater inhibition.
The nonpolar fullerene molecule has a lower tendency to approach close
to the active site and thus binds to the allosteric site (away from
the active site), thereby showing lower inhibition.

The enzymatic
activity of the dityrosine (DT) cross-linked RNase
A dimer was compared to that of the monomer using the agarose gel-based
assay. It was found that the intensity of the dimer peak is almost
2 times that of the monomer, indicating the presence of a higher amount
of active t-RNA in the dimer system as compared with the monomer (Figure S5a,b). This shows that the activity of
dimer is somewhat lower than that of the monomer. The kinetics data
(using cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate (2′,3′-cCMP)
as substrate) (Figure S5c) showed that
the maximum rate of substrate degradation decreases by 16% (from Vmax values) in the case of the dimer, which
is also reflected from the Km values,
which increases by almost 31%, indicating the reduced activity of
the dimer in comparison to that of the monomer (Table S1). This was further quantified using the Kcat value that is the turn-over number of the enzyme,
which was reduced by ∼14% for the DT cross-linked dimer as
compared with the native protein. A previous study on the enzymatic
activity of the RNase A dimer showed that the photoirradiated DT cross-linked
dimer has lower substrate affinity than the RNase A monomer.53

Fullerene acts as a potential antioxidant,
thereby suppressing
oxidative stress in proteins. The introduction of OH groups into fullerene
is expected to increase the antioxidant power of fullerenol compared
to that of the parent molecule. The antioxidant properties of these
two species were studied in the presence of RNase A by measuring the
DT fluorescence intensity. Incubation of the protein with oxidant
(Co2+ and S2O82–) in the presence of these nanoparticles showed a decrease in DT
intensity in a concentration-dependent manner. It has been observed
that the antioxidant activity increases with the increase in fullerene
concentration, as seen from the gradual decrease in DT spectra. The
case is somewhat different for fullerenol, which shows antioxidant
activity at very low concentrations that increases at elevated concentrations.
A comparative analysis of the change in DT fluorescence intensity
is shown in Figure 12. The antioxidant effect of fullerenol for RNase A is almost twice
that of fullerene at concentrations less than 10 μg/mL. There
is a slight increment in the change in DT fluorescence with an increase
in concentration for fullerenol at very low concentration, after which
it shows a regular decrease. On the other hand, the antioxidant activity
of fullerene is proportional to its concentration. Fullerene being
a radical scavenger may have the tendency to react with the sulfate
ion present, thereby preventing its effect on the Tyr residue. This
antioxidant effect is reversed for fullerenol at higher concentrations.
Although previous reports highlighted the aggregation of fullerenol
at higher concentration as a key factor for promoting oxidation,71 the exact mechanism is still to be understood.
Both fullerene and fullerenol prevent oxidative stress in protein,
and their presence in the system may inhibit the enzymatic activity.
In the present study, the concentrations of fullerene and fullerenol
both are kept above and below the Ki value
while studying their effect during oxidative stress. However, for
fullerene, significant antioxidant activity can be observed for concentrations
7.2 and 21.6 μg/mL, which are lower than the inhibition constant
value (26.49 μg/mL) of fullerene. On the other hand, fullerenol
prevents DT formations at 0.1 and 1.0 μg/mL, which are also
lower than its Ki value (4.66 μg/mL).
Thus, both fullerene and fullerenol decrease DT formation and prevent
oxidative stress in RNase A much at a much lower concentration than
the inhibition constant value. This suggests both fullerene and fullerenol
can be employed as an antioxidant without affecting the enzymatic
activity of the protein if the concentrations of these components
are kept below their respective Ki values.

concentrations of fullerene and fullerenol.

3 Conclusions
Our present work investigates
the interaction of fullerene and
fullerenol with RNase A with the possible prevention of oxidative
stress in the protein. Fullerene being highly nonpolar is sparingly
soluble in water, and to overcome this, we have prepared highly water
soluble fullerenol having ∼30–40 −OH groups within
a span of 1–2 h without any catalyst with certain modification
of previously used techniques. Although both fullerene and fullerenol
bind to the protein in a 1:1 ratio, the extent of binding is much
higher in the case of fullerene compared to that in fullerenol. This
has been further verified using molecular docking studies, which showed
that the ΔG value is more favorable in the
case of fullerene compared to that of fullerenol. The interaction
is governed mainly by hydrophobic as well as π–π
stacking interactions with the aromatic protein residues. The unsaturated
fullerene prevents oxidative stress in RNase A with an increase in
concentration, whereas for fullerenol, this effect is more pronounced
at lower concentrations. The nanoparticles also show significant inhibition
of the ribonucleolytic activity of RNase A with fullerenol showing
a lower Ki value than fullerene. Fullerene
shows noncompetitive inhibition by binding to the allosteric site,
whereas fullerenol shows a mixed-type inhibition by binding to both
the allosteric site and the active site. The experiments show that
fullerene and fullerenol have the ability to control the damage of
the protein caused due to oxidative stress and can also prevent significant
cleavage of RNA by inhibiting RNase A at a comparatively lower concentration.
This shows that hydroxylation of fullerene to fullerenol not only
affects the extent of binding with RNase A but also has a considerable
effect on DT formation caused due to oxidative stress.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
RNase
A, yeast (t-RNA),
and cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate (2′,3′-cCMP)
were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis). Fullerene (C60)
was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Cobalt acetate [Co(OAc)2], potassium persulfate (K2S2O8),
and other analytical-grade reagents were obtained from SRL India.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Preparation of Aqueous
Suspension of Fullerene
and Fullerenol
An aqueous suspension of fullerene was prepared
using the general protocol, which includes dissolution of solid fullerene
in toluene followed by a solvent-exchange method using toluene as
the organic phase and water as the aqueous phase.75,76 In brief, solid fullerene was initially dissolved in toluene and
stirred for 30 min. Water was added to the solution in a 2:1 v/v ratio,
and the entire mixture was subjected to ultrasonication till complete
evaporation of the organic solvent. The aqueous residue was filtered
using a 0.22 μm ultrafiltration membrane. The clear yellow solution
thus obtained was stored at room temperature away from light.

Several methods of fullerenol preparation have been reported, which
include oxidation of the double bond using peroxide and NaOH. Earlier
methods involved the initial acidification under drastic conditions
with the reaction being carried out at a high temperature of around
85–95 °C.77 Wang et al. devised
a unique method for the preparation of fullerenol using solid-state
organic reactions, which gave ∼16 −OH groups attached
to fullerene with very high yield.78 More
recently, Kokubo et al. showed that the number of −OH groups
increased to more than 40 when peroxides were used in the presence
of a phase-transfer catalyst (tetrabutylammonium hydroxide) at 60
°C.36 We have employed the acidification
technique followed by addition of peroxide at room temperature. For
preparation of fullerenol, 2 mL of the water suspension of fullerene
(having concentration 1 mg/mL) was acidified by conc. H2SO4 and stirred for ∼25 min. H2O2 was added dropwise to a glass vial containing NaOH pellets
followed by simultaneous addition of the acidified fullerene solution.
The mixture was stirred for another 1–2 h during which the
yellow color fades to give a colorless solution. This colorless solution
was taken in a clean, dried separating funnel, and ∼5 mL of
ethyl acetate was added to it. Around 2 mL of double-distilled water
was added to the separating funnel, and the solvents were mixed thoroughly.
This led to the separation of two colorless solvent phases, which
were collected in two test tubes separately. Fullerenol having a relatively
more hydrophobic surface prefers the organic phase and remains in
the ethyl acetate part, whereas the salts are dissolved exclusively
in the aqueous part. The organic phase was again added to the separating
funnel followed by double-distilled water, and the same process was
repeated 2–3 times. The organic part was collected and vacuum-dried,
and solid colorless fullerenol was obtained by evaporating the solvent.
An aqueous solution of fullerenol was used for further studies. The
pictorial representation of the preparation of fullerene and fullerenol
is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Preparation of Water-Soluble Fullerenol from Fullerene
4.2.2 Characterization
of Fullerene and Fullerenol
from UV–Vis Studies
UV–vis spectroscopy was
used to characterize the fullerene suspension and fullerenol solution.
Spectral measurements were carried out using a Shimadzu UV-1800 UV–vis
spectrophotometer over a wavelength range 200–600 nm at 25
°C.

4.2.3 Morphology, Size, and
ζ Potential
Measurements
Field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) was used to determine the morphology of the fullerene and
fullerenol aggregates. A drop of sample was mounted on a glass slide,
air-dried, and then scanned in Nova NanoSEM 450 operating at 10 kV.
The morphology of the aggregates was also monitored by atomic force
microscopy (AFM) using Agilent Technologies, model 5500. A drop of
sample was deposited on a freshly cleaved mica foil. The mica foil
was then allowed to dry in air and then scanned. The images were taken
in tapping mode using a silicon probe cantilever of 215–235
μm length, at a resonance frequency of 146–236 kHz, and
a force constant of 21–98 N/m.

The sizes of fullerene
and fullerenol particles were analyzed by dynamic light scattering
(DLS). The particles were initially sonicated, and sizes were determined
using a Malvern Nano ZS instrument, which operates using a 4 mW He–Ne
laser (λ = 632 nm) and a scattering angle of 173°. ζ
potential measurements were carried out using the same instrument
with very dilute solutions of the sample. The reported value is the
measurement of 100 runs and is the average of three independent readings.

4.2.4 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The characteristic vibrational bands for fullerene and fullerenol
were identified using Shimadzu IRTracer-100. The aqueous solutions
of the nanoparticles were dried over a KBr pellet before being subjected
to IR radiation.

4.2.5 Fluorescence Quenching
of Tyrosine by Fullerene
and Fullerenol
Fluorescence measurements were performed using
a Jobin Yvon Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter in a 1 cm quartz
cell using an excitation wavelength of 278 nm.64 It may be mentioned here that RNase A lacks tryptophan
(Trp). The excitation and emission bandwidths were 5 nm. The emission
spectra were recorded from 298 to 350 nm. A quantitative analysis
of the interaction with RNase A was performed by a fluorimetric titration
of a solution of RNase A in 10 mM phosphate buffer (2 μM) with
addition of fullerene (0–10 μg/mL) and fullerenol (0–2
μg/mL), total volume of the solution being 600 μL. The
binding parameters for fullerene/fullerenol have been calculated from
fluorescence quenching data using the following equations79 1   2  where ΔF = F0 – F; F0 and F are the fluorescence
intensities
of protein in the absence and presence of fullerene/fullerenol, respectively, Ksv is the Stern–Volmer constant, [Q]
is the concentration of the quencher, n is the number
of binding sites, and Kb is the equilibrium
binding constant.

4.2.6 Inhibition Studies
4.2.6.1 Agarose Gel-Based Assay
RNase
A was mixed with Tris–acetic acid buffer (pH 8) and fullerene/fullerenol.
Aliquots (20 μL) were mixed with 20 μL of t-RNA (16.6
mg/mL, freshly dissolved in RNase A-free buffer) and incubated for
30 min. The sample buffer (10 μL) with 10% glycerol and 0.025%
bromophenol blue was added to quench the reaction. Aliquots (10 μL)
were loaded onto a 1.1% agarose gel, and the undegraded t-RNA was
visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

4.2.6.2 Inhibition
Kinetics
The effect
of fullerene and fullerenol on the ribonucleolytic activity of RNase
A was checked following the method described by Anderson et al.80 The assay was carried out in oligovinylsulfonic
acid-free 0.1 M N-morholinoethane sulfonic acid–NaOH
buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl and 2′,3′-cCMP
as the substrate. The substrate concentration was varied from 0.2
to 0.9 mM and the inhibitor concentration from 0 to 10 μg/mL
for both fullerene and fullerenol. The inhibition constant and the
type of binding enzyme were established from Lineweaver–Burk
plots.81

4.2.7 Docking
Studies
The Protein Data
Bank (PDB) file of the crystal structure of the wild-type native bovine
pancreatic RNase A (PDB ID: 1FS3)82 was downloaded from
RCSB (http://www.rcsb.org) and
used for further study. The structures of fullerene and fullerenol
(30 −OH attached) were prepared and optimized in Avogadro software.83 The binding region of fullerene and fullerenol
in RNase A was identified from docking studies using AutoDock Vina
with the center positioned at the following coordinates: x = 20.489, y = 18.046, and z =
25.639 and grid size 32 Å × 28 Å × 44 Å.84 The structures were further analyzed using Chimera
software.85

4.2.8 Oxidation
of RNase A
To 200 μM
Co(OAc)2 and 2 mM K2S2O8 solution in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the RNase A solution
was added so as to make the final concentration of protein 100 μM.
For studying the antioxidant property, different concentrations of
fullerene (5–40 μg/mL) and fullerenol (0.1–10
μg/mL) were added to the oxidizing medium prior to the addition
of protein. The resultant solutions were incubated at 37 °C for
24 h.

4.2.9 Dityrosine (DT) Fluorescence
The
formation of DT in RNase A during oxidative stress was confirmed by
measuring the DT fluorescence emission intensity around 405 nm.86 The samples were excited at 317 nm, and the
emission scan range was set at 330–450 nm. Both the excitation
and emission slits were set at 5 nm with an integration time of 0.3
s.

4.2.10 Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel
Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
The oxidized and fullerene-/fullerenol-treated
protein samples were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The samples were mixed with buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol
and heated for 5 min prior to loading onto a 15% SDS polyacrylamide
gel. Staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (SRL, India) was followed
by destaining using an aqueous solution with 8% acetic acid and 6%
methanol. The molecular mass of the fractions was compared with that
of a standard-molecular-weight marker (10–250 kDa).

4.2.11 Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time
of Flight (MALDI-TOF)
To ensure the formation of an aqueous
solution of fullerene and estimate the probable molecular weight of
fullerenol, MALDI-TOF analyses were performed. This method was also
used to confirm the formation of the RNase A dimer during oxidation.
The matrix was prepared using a saturated solution of sinapinic acid
(20 mg/mL) in 1:1 (v/v) CH3CN/H2O solution containing
1% trifluoroacetic acid. Equal volumes of the fullerene and fullerenol
samples and the prepared matrix were mixed for analysis. A Bruker
ultrafleXtreme mass spectrometer was used for the measurement with
a 19 kV acceleration voltage along with pulsed ion extraction. A reflection
mode of 20 kV was used for the detection of the positive ions. Laser
desorption was done using a smartbeam-II Laser system, and 500 laser
shots were summed.
