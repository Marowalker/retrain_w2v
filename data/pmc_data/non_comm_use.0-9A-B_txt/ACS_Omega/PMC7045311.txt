The valence and conduction band offsets
for both polar and nonpolar
CuGaS2/CuAlSe2 and CuGaS2/ZnSe interfaces
were studied here by the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations.
Using the hybrid functional calculations, we show that the CuGaS2/CuAlSe2 and CuGaS2/ZnSe heterostructures
in all interfaces form type II band alignment. The difference of valence
and conduction band offsets is mainly due to lattice mismatch, generating
stress in the interface and affecting the electronic properties of
each material; meanwhile, the polarity configuration does not play
an important role in these values. From the local density of states
and the charge density, we can determine how the nature of the band
alignments changes when the semiconductor conforms to each interface.
This allows us to localize the electrons and holes at different sites
of the interface.

Introduction
The most important aspect of CuGaS2 solar cells is the
interface between CuGaS2 and the buffer layer, where the
essential physics of photovoltaics takes place with the intrinsic
band alignment as the dominant factor. Since the band alignment between
the compounds will always act as the boundary conditions imposed on
a particular interface,1 its understanding
is fundamental to comprise the driving force of the kinetics of the
electronic charge carriers and the recombination mechanism. In the
case of semiconductor heterojunctions, the correct description of
the relative alignment of the energy bands is critical for the improvement
of the design of high-performance electronic devices. In a previous
report,2 we studied the band alignment
of the interfaces between CuGaS2 and several contact materials,
and we have found that the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 and
CuGaS2/ZnSe interfaces show the desirable characteristics
for the design and development of thin-film solar cells. The results
suggest that the interfaces between them would affect the conversion
efficiency in such devices.3

However,
theoretical complications arising from complex interfacial
bonding interactions and the lattice mismatch between the compounds
have hindered the development of general analytic models capable of
accurately predicting fundamental interfacial quantities.4 The large lattice mismatch between CuGaS2 and the contact material (CuAlSe2 ≈ 6%
and ZnSe ≈ 5%) and the type II band alignment of the two interfaces
have motivated intensive studies on CuGaS2 heterostructures
because the type of alignment is always accompanied by natural charge
carrier separation, which is advantageous for promising solar cells.

The band offsets are well defined when the materials are in contact
with the interface, requiring a so-called pseudomorphic interface,
in which at least one of the materials is strained to match the in-plane
lattice constant across the interface. Also, according to an experimental
report,5 epilayers of ternary chalcopyrite
semiconductors grown on GaAs(111) or GaAs (110) exhibit several epitaxial
orientations. It is for this reason that it is important to study
how the polarity configuration of the interfaces can affect the band
alignment.

In this work, we used calculations based on density
functional
(DFT) theory and the hybrid functional with the modified fraction
of screened short-range Hartree–Fock exchange (HSE06) to deeply
understand how the band alignment occurs at the interfaces of CuGaS2 (a light absorber candidate) and the semiconductors CuAlSe2 and ZnSe, proposed as contacts materials in applications
as solar cells, taking into account different polarity configurations
such as polar directions (001) and (112) and nonpolar directions (110)
and (102). According to our results, CuGaS2 can act as
a donor material and, at the same time, as an acceptor semiconductor
depending on the material it is interacting with. This behavior is
confirmed from our ab initio calculations based on the analysis of
the local density of states (LDOS) and the charge density distribution
of the heterostructures.

Model and Computational Technique
We performed first-principles calculations based on the framework
of the generalized Kohn–Sham scheme6,7 using
the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method8 and either the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)9,10 or the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional,11−13 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).14−16 In particular, we showed that the hybrid functional HSE06 with the
modified fraction of screened short-range Hartree–Fock exchange
gives accurate band gaps for the semiconductors considered in this
study.2 The electronic wavefunctions were
expanded in a plane wave basis setup to a kinetic energy cutoff of
450 eV, and the atomic positions were optimized using the conjugate
gradient method until the force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV
Å–1. The valence electron configurations used
in our calculations are Cu 3d104p1, Ga 4s24p1, S 3s23p4, Al 3s23p1, Se 4s24p4, and Zn 3d104p2. Brillouin zone sampling was performed with
the Monkhorst–Pack special k-point mesh.17 To compute the interface between CuGaS2 and
CuAlSe2 and the ZnSe semiconductors, the supercell slab
model was used here, employing an 8 × 8 × 1 mesh for the
(001), (112), and (110) interfaces; meanwhile, for the (102) surface,
a 6 × 2 × 1 mesh was used. The valence band maximum (VBM)
and conduction band minimum (CBM) energies were calculated at the
center of the Brillouin zone. We constructed a supercell that includes
one slab of each semiconductor and has one interface between them
at the center of the supercell. Four specific polarity configurations
are considered to construct the heterostructures: two polar interfaces,
(001) and (112), and two nonpolar interfaces, (110) and (102) (Figure 1). For the polar
interfaces, each slab contains 12 atomic layers, while for the nonpolar
interfaces, each slab contains eight atomic layers of each semiconductor.
All surfaces of contact are able to form cation–anion bonds
across the interface, minimizing any charge accumulation.

interfaces. The top and bottom of the heterostructure correspond to
CuGaS2 and CuAlSe2, respectively. For the CuGaS2/ZnSe interfaces, the heterostructures are constructed similarly.
The dashed line represent the interface.

To obtain the valence and conduction band offsets, we used an electrostatic
potential-based alignment method.18,19 The goal of
this method is to model a real epitaxial interface where the band
gap of the materials forming the interface can be different from that
of the bulk, while the electrostatic potential is used to connect
the macroscopic band energy levels for the bulk systems and the interfaces.20,21 For that, we averaged the electrostatic potential within the xy plane parallel to the interface between the two semi-infinite
semiconductors. For sufficiently thick layers (minimum of eight atomic
layers for each of the two materials), the electrostatic potentials
in the center of each layer become bulk-like and allow the extraction
of a band alignment representative of an infinite interface. The valence
band offsets at each interface are calculated, as is explained in
detail in ref (2) using
the equation ΔEVB = ΔEPint –
ΔEPB + ΔEVB, where ΔEPint is the discontinuity
in this reference potential across the interfaces, and ΔEPB and ΔEVB are the differences between the electrostatic potential and
the valence band edges, respectively, obtained from the two independent
bulk calculations of the single phases. Finally, knowing the relative
position of the valence bands, we simply add the theoretical band
gaps for each semiconductor forming each slab to obtain the conduction
band offsets (ΔECB).

Results and Discussion
Lattice
Mismatch
To develop a complete systematical
analysis of the band alignments between the CuGaS2/CuAlSe2 and CuGaS2/ZnSe interfaces, we proposed, as a
first step, four interfacial heterostructures: two polar interfaces
in the (001) and (112) directions and two nonpolar interfaces in the
(110) and (102) directions. This is done to observe the effects of
the interface polarity in the behavior of the structural and electronic
properties. It is important to ensure that the strain introduced by
this way does not alter the electronic properties in an unrealistic
way. Based on our experience, we expected that changing the lattice
constant of a Cu-chalcopyrite surface by ∼1.5% already altered
the band gap by ∼0.1 eV. In contrast, a larger change in the
lattice parameter had an even more dramatic effect. A tensile strain
of ∼10.0% reduces the band gap by ∼0.6 eV.2

Since the unit cell of CuAlSe2 (or ZnSe) is slightly larger than that of CuGaS2, one
might expect an increase in the in-plane lattice constant for CuGaS2 in both heterostructures. To minimize the strain that is
introduced by the interface, we constructed the unrelaxed supercell
with in-plane lattice constants equal to the average between the lattice
constants of the constituent semiconductors. To calculate the strain
of the in-plane lattice constant, in the perpendicular direction of
the interface, we used the following definition: S = 100 × (a – abulk)/abulk), where a and abulk are, respectively, the in-plane
lattice constant of the relaxed interface layer and the in-plane lattice
constant of the bulk-like constituent semiconductor.

In Table 1, we present
the calculated strains between CuGaS2 and the other semiconductors
involved in the four proposed interfaces. According to our results,
in all the interfaces, the contact material CuGaS2 tends
to expand the in-plane lattice constants parallel to the interface,
and the variation of the lattice constant of the semiconductor on
the slab with respect to the bulk-like parameter is less than 4.0%.
Nevertheless, this semiconductor suffers the greatest distortion compared
to the other semiconductors, leading to a weakening in the bonds between
the atoms that participate in the interface and furthermore affecting
the band alignments between them.

Proposed Semiconductor when Conforming to the Interface)
 	S (%)

(110)	2.12	–1.23	2.37	–0.96	
(102)	3.41	–0.78	3.76	–1.27	
On the other hand, the CuAlSe2 and ZnSe
semiconductors
are under compressive strain in the range of 0.3–1.3%. Such
a small value of strain would avoid loss of structural coherency and
formation of misfit dislocations at the interfaces.22 This is important to consider because, as can be seen below,
the lattice mismatch determines the magnitude of the structural variation
displayed by the different types of interfaces and this can generate
band gap fluctuations in all semiconductors. Finally, according to
the theoretical strain of the in-plane lattice constant, the general
behavior of the polar interfaces on the lattice mismatch is similar
to that of the nonpolar interfaces. However, it can be noticed that
the nonpolar configuration (110) presents the lower difference between
the absolute value of the change in percentage of the theoretical
strains with respect to the bulk-like semiconductors. This can be
interpreted as an equitable distribution of the stress induced by
the distortion on the lattice parameters, while the polar directions
present a higher distortion of the bond lengths because of the difference
between the involved ionic nature of the terminations.

Electronic
Properties
As we mentioned earlier, the
strain induced by the interface generates band gap fluctuations in
CuGaS2 and the contact semiconductors. Therefore, DFT calculations
under the precision of HSE06 approximation13 are needed not only to evaluate the band gaps but also to determine
the band alignments. We calculated the band gap of CuGaS2, CuAlSe2, and ZnSe from the adjustment of the HF mixing
in the hybrid functional. Increasing the HF mixing from the standard
value of 0.25 in the HSE06 functional in all semiconductors gives
the band gaps of 2.43 eV for CuGaS2, 2.65 eV for CuAlSe2, and 2.82 eV for ZnSe,2 which
agree pretty well to the experimental values.23−25

From Table 2, we can observe how
these values change with respect to the strain. Particularly, the
CuGaS2 band gap decreases (respect to the bulk material)
by a significant amount (0.06–0.28 eV) depending on the interface
orientation and the contact material. For CuGaS2, the strain
of the in-plane lattice constant of the interface increases the Cu–S
bond length. The Cu d orbitals are more diffuse, overlapping more
effectively with the S orbitals; this leads to a substantial upward
repulsion of the anion p states and a reduction in the band gap. The
conduction band minimum also contributes in the reduction of the band
gap, which could be attributed to the fact that the CBM is conformed
by strong Ga s states, whereas the other states in the conduction
band are more heavily mixed with atomic orbitals such as S p states.26,27 Inversely, for CuAlSe2 and ZnSe, the internal compression
produced an opening of the band gap. In the case of CuAlSe2, it increases to 0.19 eV as the lattice mismatch enlarges. For ZnSe,
the band gap increases by a negligible amount (∼0.085 eV) as
the internal stress augments. On the other hand, the CuAlSe2 structure responds in an opposite way to CuGaS2, and
the band gap expansion occurs through an upward shift of the CBM,
which consists mostly of the antibonding states of Al s and Se s orbitals.
Since the selenium atom is closer to the aluminum atom, the antibonding
state resulting from Se 4p–Al 3s hybridization is pushed to
higher energies and the band gap is increased.26 The general trend that we can find, according to Table 1, is that, when the
strain in the material increases, the band gap reduces; meanwhile,
when the strain decreases, the band gap enlarges.

In Figure 2, we
show the LDOS projected along the direction perpendicular to the interfaces.
In all cases, the band gap varies nonmonotonically across the interface
due to the bending of band edges. For the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 interfaces (Figure 2a–d), the valence manifold near to the Fermi level
is almost completely occupied by states lying on CuAlSe2; meanwhile, the conduction manifold contains mainly CuGaS2 states near to the Fermi level. However, for the ZnSe/CuGaS2 interfaces (Figure 2e–h), this behavior is reversed and the larger contribution
to the valence manifold near to the Fermi level is due to the CuGaS2 states, while the conduction manifold conforms to the ZnSe
states. All the calculated LDOS show the charge separation in the
heterostructures, a characteristic behavior of the type II band alignment.
Thus, for the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 interfaces, the
holes are confined to CuAlSe2, while the electrons are
in CuGaS2, and in the case of the ZnSe/CuGaS2 interfaces, the holes are now confined to CuGaS2, and
the electrons are localized on ZnSe.

for the series
of (a, b, e, f) polar and (c, d, g, h) nonpolar interfaces, respectively.
The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum refer to the
Fermi level. The zero of energy is at the Fermi level.

To complement the previous LDOS analysis, we proceeded to
develop
the study of the behavior of the charge transfer, which was computed
based on the Baders topological analysis,28 where the three-dimensional space is partitioned into basins, belonging
to individual atoms delimited by surfaces through which the flux of
the density gradient is zero. In our case, for the Bader analysis,
we used the Henkelman group implementation29−31 to quantify
the amount of charge transferred across the interfaces. As we can
see in Table 3, the
absolute values of the charge for both semiconductors are similar
at each interface in all the proposed orientations. For the CuGaS2/CuAlSe2 interface, the localization of negative
charge is observed on CuGaS2, while for CuGaS2/ZnSe, it is located on ZnSe, corroborating the charge redistribution
found from the LDOS. The largest change occurs at the interface of
the nonpolar (102) CuGaS2/ZnSe heterostructures, where
the Se atoms increase their electron density (1.76 e), making them
less positive; the larger contribution to this charge increment occurs
in the second layer of the interface.

The same behavior can be
recognized from the plotting of the electronic
charge density difference, as shown in Figure 3. The red and blue regions in the figure
represents electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. In Figure 3a,c, it can be seen
that there is electron enrichment around the sulfur atoms, whereas
electron deficiency appears around the aluminum atoms, indicating
an electron transference from the CuAlSe2 surface to CuGaS2. Meanwhile, in Figure 3b,d, the transferred electrons to the ZnSe material are mostly
contributed by the sulfur atoms of CuGaS2. All the presented
estimated electronic properties are in good agreement with the band
alignment obtained from the electrostatic potential-based alignment
method (Table 4), as
we present in the next section.

Band Alignments
To determine how the band alignments
take place between CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 and ZnSe/CuGaS2, we first calculated the electrostatic potential difference
between the two semiconductors that conform to the interface. For
this purpose, we plot the plane-averaged electrostatic potentials
along the heterostructure, and then we determine the mean of these
potentials in the corresponding materials. Using this method, we obtain
a value of ΔEPint for each interface, and then we
compute the band edges relative to the electrostatic potential for
each bulk semiconductor. Since these are distorted due to the epitaxial
strain, we took the lattice constants and atomic coordinates from
the central part of each slab in the model. The change in the local
averaged electrostatic potentials between the two semiconductors at
the proposed polar and nonpolar interfaces is presented in Figure 4 to facilitate their
comparison and analysis. In all the cases, we can notice that the
energy range of the averaged electrostatic potential of CuGaS2 is smaller than the ones of the other semiconductors. Also,
in Figure 4, we included
the energy position of valence band maximum and the conduction band
minimum of each semiconductor with respect to the reference potential
energy to have an insight into the estimated band offset.

Insets: Energy positions of the top edge of the valence band and the
bottom edge of the conduction band. Similar results found for the
other proposed systems are not shown here.

Table 4 shows the
theoretical band offsets for the polar and nonpolar CuGaS2/CuAlSe2 and CuGaS2/ZnSe interfaces. We have
used a sign convention such that a positive value of the band offset
for the discontinuity at the junction CuGaS2/CuAlSe2 corresponds to an upward step in going from CuGaS2 to CuAlSe2, as employed in ref (18). Knowing the relative
position of the valence bands, we simply add the theoretical band
gaps for each semiconductor forming each slab to obtain the conduction
band offsets (ΔECB). However, the ΔECB values given by standard DFT calculations are incorrect because
the GGA functionals underestimate the band gap of the semiconductors
studied here. Unfortunately, experimentally measured values also have
very large uncertainties.32 For that reason,
we calculate the band gap of each distorted semiconductor with the
HSE hybrid functional using the optimum value obtained before each
relaxed, nonstrained pure semiconductor.

From the calculated
ΔEVB and ΔECB for both CuGaS2/CuAlSe2 and CuGaS2/ZnSe interfaces,
we find a type II band alignment. In this type
of band alignment, the two bands are shifted in the same direction,
leading to a band structure in which the lowest CBM occurs on one
of the sides and the highest VBM on the other, with energy separation
between the two of them lower than the those of the two bulk band
gaps.33 We can see that, in all the cases,
the band alignments are conserved since the total dipolar moment is
equal to zero in all the heterostructures proposed here; this can
be explained because the different polar and nonpolar slab configurations
affect mainly the structural properties and, as a consequence, also
the electronic properties.

As we show in Table 4, the calculated ΔEVB and
ΔECB for
the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 interface are in the range
of 0.03–0.21 eV and 0.32–0.86 eV, respectively. For
the CuGaS2/ZnSe interface, ΔEVB and ΔECB are calculated similarly. However, ΔEVB was estimated to be 0.74–1.27 eV; meanwhile, the ΔEVB of nonpolar surfaces gave a value of 0.87–1.03 eV.
These results are consistent with the empirical work of Chen et al.34 This leads to localization of the electrons
and holes on different sides of the interface, which is beneficial
for improving the performance of photovoltaic devices.

To have
a deep understanding of the band alignment between CuGaS2 and the contact materials (CuAlSe2 and ZnSe),
we have further calculated the charge density isosurface of both interfaces
of each heterostruture. Figure 5a–d shows that the VBM (CBM) is located in the semiconductor
CuAlSe2 (CuGaS2), which clearly indicates the
spatial separation of electrons and holes in the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 interface. On the other hand, for the CuGaS2/ZnSe interface, the behavior is inverse; the VBM (CBM) is
located in the CuGaS2 (ZnSe) component, as we can see in Figure 5e–h. It is
well known that, when two different materials conform to an interface,
an intrinsic electric field is generated. This phenomenon is observed
because the material that possess the larger total electron number
in its respective unit cell transfers electrons to the other material,
generating holes in its own VBM. Meanwhile, the acceptor electron
material now presents new occupied states at the CBM due to the extra
received electrons. Applying this to our proposed heterostructures,
the acceptor material is CuGaS2 for the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 interface and, at the same time, plays the role
of a donor material when conforming to the ZnSe/CuGaS2 interfaces.
This kind of localization of electrons and holes in different materials
is characteristic of type II (staggered) band alignment.35 All of these electronic properties of both interfaces
are closely related to the carrier mobility.

Figure 5 Isosurface charge density
distributions at VBM and CBM for (a–d)
the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 and (e–h) ZnSe/CuGaS2 interfaces. The charge is displayed using a threshold of
6 × 10–5 e/Å3.

By comparing the calculated isosurface charge density with
the
LDOS of the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 interface (Figure 2a–d), we can
see that the edges of the valence and conduction bands are almost
equal in both sides of the interface, and as one moves away from it,
the bulk features begin to be recovered for each semiconductor. So,
in the case of this heterostructure, we can observe that states of
the closer valence band edge to the Fermi level mainly correspond
to CuAlSe2, demonstrating a donor character; meanwhile,
in contrast, the conduction band edge contains CuGaS2 states
near the Fermi level for the most part. This is in good agreement
with the charge separation, as can we see in Figure 3.

According to Figure 5 and Table 4, the
band alignment of the CuGaS2/CuAlSe2 polar surfaces
agrees with those for the nonpolar surfaces within 0.1 eV, which is
consistent with the experimental observation.5 However, we find that the band alignment in the (001) surface orientation
leads to a dramatic decrease in the ΔECB to 0.3 eV
with those for the (112), (110), and (102) surfaces. This could be
attributed to the surface atomic arrangements of the different surfaces
and the distance between atomic planes in the unit cell, which could
affect the surface chemistry. The (001) polar surfaces of CuGaS2 can be terminated by cationic layers that consist of either
50% of Cu atoms and 50% of Ga atoms (see Figure 1); meanwhile, the anionic layers consist
of 100% of S atoms, so they can generate a total interfacial dipole
that can slightly shift the charge density distribution but not in
a dominant way. This behavior can be observed on the charge density
isosurface for the (001) or (112) interfaces (see Figure 5a,c), where the charge density
distribution at VBM is localized on the Cu atoms of CuAlSe2; meanwhile, the charge density distribution at CBM is localized
mainly in the sulfur atoms of CuGaS2. That is the reason
why the transition from the valence band to the conduction band mainly
occurs between the S and Cu states, which is beneficial to the separation
of electron–hole pairs. On the other hand, for the nonpolar
interfaces, the charge density is distributed uniformly along the
layers of each band. Similar results were found for the CuGaS2/ZnSe interfaces.

Finally, our studies show that the
electrostatic potential is not
affected by the polarity on the interfaces. Nevertheless, we notice
that the termination cation and anion surfaces affect the length of
the bonds between the atoms that conform to the interface, and this
modifies the electronic properties of each semiconductor at the interface
and can shift the band offsets, which reflects the importance of atomic
relaxations at this interface.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have presented results of first-principles calculations,
which properly include strain and relaxation effects at the polar
and nonpolar interfaces between CuGaS2 and the CuAlSe2 and ZnSe semiconductors, to achieve a complete understanding
of the physical process that is involved in the band alignment. Based
on the above analysis, we can determine that the distortions of the
lattice at the interface induced shifts in ΔEVB,
and as a consequence, the Eg values of both materials change
with respect to the bulk values; for that reason, correct treatment
of the band gap is important to obtain an accurate ΔECB.

From the electronic properties, we can conclude that, in
the CuAlSe2/CuGaS2 systems, CuAlSe2 acts as a electron
donor material and CuGaS2 as an acceptor compound. Meanwhile,
in the case of the ZnSe/CuGaS2 interfaces, the holes are
confined to CuGaS2, and the electrons are localized on
ZnSe. This is clearly observed from the LDOS and the charge density
distributions since we can notice that the semiconductor with the
larger electron number on the unit cell transfers electrons to the
semiconductor with the lowest electron number.

The confinement
of the charge carriers on a specific side of the
interface, presented on the obtained results in this study, guarantees
the correct carrier mobility and avoids their recombination. Finally,
the polarity configuration does not play an important role in the
band alignment; rather, it is determined by the intrinsic nature of
the atoms at both sides of the interface and the induced strain.
