Nanobiocomposites
with balanced mechanical characteristics are
fabricated from poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)blend
at a weight ratio of 80/20 in association with varying concentrations
of functionalized chitosan (FCH) through reactive
extrusion at a temperature of 185 °C. The combined effect of FCH and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) showed insignificant change
in tensile strength with a remarkable increase in % elongation at
break (∼45%) values. Addition of DCP also caused increase in
the molecular weight (Mw ∼ 22%)
of the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite, which is attributed
to the cross-linking/branching effect of FCH on the
polymers. The interfacial polymer–filler adhesion is also improved,
which is observed from the field-emission scanning electron microscopy
images of PLA/PBS/1DFCH. For PLA/PBS/1DFCH, the crystallization rate and nucleation density of PLA are increased
because of cross-linked/branched structures are developed, which
acted as nucleating sites. Therefore, the present work facilitates
a simple extrusion processing with a combination of balanced thermal
and mechanical properties, improved hydrophobicity (∼27%),
and UV-C-blocking efficiency, which draw the possibility for the utilization
of the ecofriendly nanobiocomposite in the packing of UV-sensitive
materials on a commercial level.

Introduction
The recent trend is
focused on consumption of bioplastics in developing
a novel process for the fabrication of ecofriendly polymeric materials
and for solving the fossil-oil crisis associated with conventional
synthetic polymers.1 Poly(lactic acid)
(PLA), a biomass-based thermoplastic polyester, is generally produced
from renewable resources (tapioca roots, sugar beet, and sugar cane)
and is the most sustainable alternative to the conventional synthetic
polymers compared with other biopolymers.2 Among those bioplastics, PLA has drawn considerable interest due
to its competitive mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and easier
processibility.3 However, the application
of PLA on industrial scale is limited because of its brittle nature,
high glass-transition temperature (Tg ∼
55 °C), low crystallization rate, poor melt strength, and inferior
barrier properties.4

From this view
point, modification of PLA by copolymerization or
physical blending and loading of a nanofiller or plasticizer is an
economic and effective approach to overcome these limitations. The
primary role of blending of PLA with flexible biopolymers that exhibit
lower Tg values such as poly(butylene
succinate) [PBS (Tg ∼ −32
°C)], poly(butylenes succinate-co-adipate) (Tg ∼ −45 °C), and polycaprolactone
(Tg ∼ −60 °C) is to
maintain the biodegradability with tuned Tg, which resolves the brittleness problem and finally improves the
toughness.5,6

Melt polycondensation allows the synthesis
of PBS by the reaction
of 1,4-butanediol with succinic acid, which can also be derived using
monomers from fossil feedstock or renewable bioresources.7,8 PBS is also a bio-based polyester with high flexibility, impact
strength, and chemical resistance, which is similar to polypropylene
(PP). Thus, PBS has attracted much attention as a promising ecofriendly
bioplastic and could be an appropriate choice to melt-mix it with
PLA. Nevertheless, applications of PBS are limited because of its
poor gas barrier, water vapor transmission rate, and melt viscosity
(η) in the packaging sector.

In fact, PLA/PBS system is
one of the best choices because the
combination of two gives the desired properties of each polymer. One
polymer has potential to tailor the mechanical characteristics (e.g.,
toughness, elongation at break) of the blend to control the physiological
environment by varying the blend ratio, and the other polymer provides
stability to the molecular properties of the two-component system.6,9 Many research papers are reported about the PLA/PBS system in the
literature, and it is claimed that the PLA/PBS (80/20) blend has shown
better compatibility in comparison to that of other blend ratios.10 However, the properties of this system are not
significantly enhanced by melt processing probably due to poor interfacial
adhesion and phase separation between PLA and PBS.

Chitosan
(CH) is a cationic polysaccharide produced by deacetylation
of chitin, which is an extremely recommended biopolymer for packaging
applications due to its biodegradability; biocompatibility; excellent
oxygen barrier; antioxidant, antifungal, and antimicrobial characteristics;
and most importantly its film forming ability.10 It is the second most abundant biopolymer in nature after
cellulose and can be used as a polymer matrix as well as in the form
of a biofiller. On the other hand, chitosan has poor dispersion in
the PLA matrix due to its hydrophilic nature. According to Pal et
al.,10 hydrophobic functionalized chitosan
(FCH) can solve the dispersion problem of chitosan
in the hydrophobic PLA matrix. It is also worth mentioning that FCH has a great potential to be used as a bio-based filler
in the food packaging application with enhanced barrier properties.

As mentioned above, PLA, PBS, and FCH are one
of the most promising candidates and play vital roles to contribute
toward the marketing of bioplastics designed for sustainable packaging.
None of these three components can fulfill the demand for almost all
structural materials in packaging application when used alone. For
food packaging applications, barrier to UV light is also one of the
essential characteristics to inhibit the decomposition of packed food
stuff.11 It is a well-known fact that UV
light damages the vitamins and fatty acids found in food items. Therefore,
this demand should be fulfilled for its benefits in the food packaging
application.

The evolution of the nanobiocomposite with requisite
melt strength,
thermal performance, and stiffness–toughness balance is still
a challenging task. In comparison with a binary system, a multicomponent
polymer system usually shows more balanced performance in terms of
physicochemical and thermal properties. Recently, investigation on
the properties of multicomponent-based polymeric systems formed by
the combination of three or more components has attracted the attention
from both the commercial and the academic world.12 Therefore, significant attention has to be paid for multicomponent-based
polymeric systems at industrial scale.

To the best our knowledge,
a PLA/PBS/FCH-based
nanobiocomposite in the presence and absence of dicumyl peroxide (DCP)
has not been evaluated so far. To consider the promising tailored
characteristics of PLA and PBS, we investigated the influence of FCH and DCP (as a compatibilizing agent) on various analytical
properties of the PLA/PBS system.

The reactive extrusion technique
is utilized to prepare the nanobiocomposite
with balanced performance, and different characteristics such as surface
morphology, structural, thermal, and mechanical properties of the
multicomponent system are evaluated to check its feasibility of production
in a continuous manner. These complementary properties of PLA/PBS/FCH with addition of DCP are very important in tailoring
the mechanical properties, melt strength and thermal performance.

Results
and Discussion
Plausible
Reaction Mechanism
The plausible reaction mechanism of the
nanobiocomposites in the presence of DCP during the melt state under
high shear action is illustrated in Scheme 1. When DCP is decomposed into free radicals
at elevated temperature, it could facilitate the extraction of H’s
from the PLA and PBS chains to generate free radicals on the backbone
of PLA and PBS components, which is a result of propagation of the
radical reaction to form a cross-linked/branched structure between
PLA and PBS.13,14 PLA generates free radicals on
tertiary C atoms, which get readily stabilized during reactive extrusion.4,14 It is well reported that PBS contains many secondary hydrogen (H)
atoms and provides easy abstraction of hydrogen’s (H) by peroxide
radicals in comparison with PLA. On the other hand, free radicals
are formed on lactic acid oligomer (OLLA) chains attached to FCH. It is worth mentioning that there are possibilities
of the formation of a strong covalent (C–C) chemical linkage
via a combination of PLA/FCH, PBS/FCH, PLA/PBS, PLA/PLA, PBS/PBS, PLA/PBS/FCH, and
PLA/FCH/PBS. This may result in the formation of
more complex products, which include crosslinking/branching of PLA
and PBS with FCH, and PLA-g-PBS
copolymers, and the resulting reaction will be more complicated.4,15,16 In a nutshell, it can be assessed
that the cross-linked/branched structures in the nanobiocomposites
play a vital role to amend the properties of the reactive nanobiocomposites
in a controlled fashion. With the help of literature, we have put
forwarded a plausible reaction mechanism shown in Figure 1.

Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Analysis
The FTIR–attenuated
total reflectance (ATR) technique is used to identify the structural
modification taking place during the chemical reactions among PLA,
PBS, and FCH in the presence of DCP, as shown in Figure 2. The characteristic
infrared bands of all of the samples are tabulated in Table 1. The representative characteristic
peaks of PLA are as follows: 2996 (corresponding to the asymmetric
CH3 stretching), 2946 (symmetric CH3 stretching),
2880 (C–H stretching), 1748 (C=O stretching), 1382 (symmetric
bending of CH3), 1381–1358 (symmetric bending of
CH3), 1452 (asymmetric bending of CH3), 1180
(asymmetric C–O–C asymmetric rocking CH3),
1128 (symmetric rocking CH3), 1080 (symmetric stretching
C–O–C), 1041 (stretching C–CH3), 868
(stretching C–COO and also attributed to the amorphous region
of the PLA phase), 954 (rocking CH3 + stretching C–C),
and 753 cm–1 (bending C=O in PLA due to its
crystalline phase).17−19 However, PBS shows a band at 2880 cm–1 (−CH2 stretching) in the PLA/PBS blend. For PLA/PBS/1FCH spectra, the transmittance band at 1646 cm–1 also confirms the presence of amide linkage in FCH. It is noticed that the intensity of bands at 2996, 2946, and
2880 cm–1 is decreased, whereas the band at 2964
(−CH2 vibration) is more intense than that of the
PLA/PBS blend. However, a new chemical bond is not formed after the
addition of FCH into the PLA/PBS blend, which indicates
merely an electrostatic interaction of FCH with the
PLA/PBS system.20

After addition of DCP into PLA/PBS/1FCH, we observe
that the band at 2996 cm–1 is slightly shifted to
2992 cm–1 and the band at 1748 cm–1 is shifted to 1746 cm–1 due to change in structure.
The peak at 2880 cm–1 is absent and two new peaks
at 2918 cm–1 (asymmetric stretching CH3) and 2850 cm–1 (symmetric stretching CH3) are found. Further modification in the chain due to branching/cross-linking
through the formation of a new band at 805 cm–1 (C–C
bond) is detected, which influences the intensity of ester linkages.21 While chain modification in PBS chains is confirmed
through the presence of doublet attributed to twisting of CH2 at 1338–1312 cm–1, C=O group at
1712 cm–1 and band at 917 cm–1 assigned to C–OH bending in carboxylic group.22−24 It may suggest the interaction of PLA, PBS, and FCH in the presence of DCP existed upon reactive modification.

Gel Content
(%)
As mentioned in the schematics of the reaction mechanism,
the PLA/PBS ternary nanobiocomposite system with the DCP content shows
a complex type of reaction through the formation of a cross-linked/branched
structure as well as a copolymer of PLA and PBS in the presence of
DCP. The gel contents of PLA/PBS and PLA/PBS/FCH
nanobiocomposites at various FCH loadings (1 and
3 wt %) with the addition of 1 phr DCP are determined on the basis
of the extraction process. It is found that the gel fraction of the
PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite is significantly improved
in comparison to that of the PLA/PBS blend, as shown in Figure 3. The reason behind such high
gel content is the development of cross-linking sites within all of
the three components. At the fixed DCP amount, the gel fractions of
PLA/PBS with FCH composites are approximately inversely
proportional to the FCH quantity. It is observed
that the calculated gel fraction is lower than 10% when the FCH content is 3 wt % in the presence of DCP. This is probably
due to the reduction in cross-linking efficiency, which subsequently
leads to the thermal decomposition of the polymeric system due to
agglomeration of FCH at higher loading (3 wt %).25

Gel Permeation
Chromatography (GPC) Analysis
Figure 4a,b represents the distribution of molecular
weight and polydispersity index (PDI) for PLA and PLA/PBS-based nanobiocomposite
with or without DCP as a function of FCH content.
Compared with the processed PLA, depletion in the Mw and Mn values of the PLA/PBS
blend by ∼22 and ∼10%, respectively, indicates that
it had experienced thermal degradation during its processing at elevated
temperature. Interestingly, reactive extrusion of PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposites shows an increase in both Mn and Mw by ∼16
and ∼51%, respectively, and this could be due to the formation
of some cross-linking/branching sites, which is also referred to as
an improvement in the value of gel content, as mentioned in the previous
section. This is probably due to the fact that reactive processing
helps to inhibit the thermal decomposition in the presence of
1 phr DCP. However, the PLA/PBS/3DFCH nanobiocomposite
underwent a decrease in Mn and Mw with a slightly high PDI ∼ 2.4 and
a noticeable reduction in the gel content supports the possible agglomeration.

(Mn) and weight-average
(Mw) molecular weight distribution and
(b) polydispersity index (PDI) of PLA and PLA/PBS-based composites
in the presence of DCP as a function of FCH content.

When FCH is added
into PLA/PBS, it displays small
reduction in values of Mn and Mw, as compared to those of the PLA/PBS blend.
Therefore, it can be inferred that FCH has a minor
effect on thermal decomposition of the PLA/PBS blend. After addition
of DCP, the cross-linking and degradation occur simultaneously in
the reactive modified nanobiocomposite, which enhanced both the high-
and low-molecular-weight regions, resulting in the improvement of
PDI (broadening molecular weight distribution) index. From Figure 2S, the presence of cross-linked/long-chain
branched linkage is confirmed due to the appearance of a new shoulder
peak in the side of the high-molecular-weight (Mw) population in the case of PLA/PBS/1DFCH.
Also, this fact should be considered that the hydrodynamic volume
is highly influenced by the chain topology and thus determination
of molar mass distribution using only GPC is not a preferable technique.21

Field-Emission
Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) Analysis
As it is known
that PLA and PBS are semicrystalline polymers, their thermal resistance
and mechanical characteristics are mostly affected by two important
factors, i.e., solid-state morphology and % crystallinity.26 The fractured morphology of all of the nanobiocomposites
as well as the PLA/PBS sample was observed through FESEM analysis.
For the polymer blend, moderate interfacial adhesion between two phases
is favorable to the enhancement of mechanical characteristics, particularly
toughness, whereas too weak or too strong interfacial adhesions suppress
the stress through interfacial debonding or induce complete phase
separation between dispersed and matrix phases. FESEM micrographs
of the fractured surfaces of PLA/PBS, PLA/PBS/DCP, and PLA/PBS/FCH with and without DCP are displayed in Figure 5a–d. It has
been reported earlier that PLA and PBS are partially compatible to
each other.14 As seen in Figure 5a, PBS is poorly embedded in
the PLA matrix and the interfacial adhesion between PLA and PBS phases
is weak, as evidenced by the oval cavities found after the tensile
deformation.12,27 In case of the PLA/PBS reactive
blend, no dispersed phase of PBS is noticed due to reduction in PBS
size.14,27 Moreover, the presence of voids between
PLA and PBS is also observed. These could assist as stress concentrators
during tensile stress, responsible to level off the mechanical properties
such as tensile strength (TS) in Figure 5b.

surface of the PLA-based
ternary system: (a) PLA/PBS blend, (b, b′) PLA/PBS/1DCP, (c,
c′) PLA/PBS/FCH, and (d, d′) PLA/PBS/1DFCH.

For the PLA/PBS/1FCH nanobiocomposite, FCH is dispersed
into the PLA/PBS phase, as displayed in Figure 5c. After the addition
of 1 wt % FCH in PLA/PBS/DCP, the morphology of the
nanobiocomposite is quite uniform, as clearly demonstrated in Figure 5d. Moreover, the FCH nanoparticles are well adhered to PLA and PBS phases
in the presence of DCP and no voids are noticed after the tensile
fracture, indicating improvement in the interfacial adhesion between
PLA and PBS phases, which is again attributed to the development of
a copolymer or crosslink network at the interface. Consequently, it
could control the mechanical properties significantly. It also has
the potential to prevent stress concentration when the external force
is applied to the composite in tensile mode.27 Therefore, synergistic influence of FCH along with
DCP could enhance the compatibility of PLA and PBS domains in the
studied nanobiocomposites.

Wide-Angle
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
The crystal structures of
PLA/PBS ternary nanobiocomposites have been verified to observe the
influence of cross-linking/branching by using the wide-angle XRD technique.
From Figure 1S, it is clear that neat PLA
has no peak at the set processing conditions; it confirms that the
sample is amorphous in nature. However, diffraction peaks positioned
at Bragg angles of 16.4° (200)/(110) and 18.6° (110) are
assigned to the α′ phase crystal of PLA in PLA/PBS and
their nanobiocomposites, as shown in Figure 6a.26,28 This represents the
orthorhombic crystal unit cell of PLA, which is confirmed by reflection
pattern (200). The peaks appearing at 22.5° (110) are assigned
to PBS. When 1 wt % FCH is added with DCP in the
PLA/PBS blend, it shows an increase in the peak height at 16.4°,
indicating the growth of α′-crystal of PLA. From Figure 6b, it is noticed
that the addition of FCH into PLA/PBS gradually decreases
the relative crystallinity (Xc) of PLA
in the PLA/PBS ternary nanobiocomposite. However, Xc of the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite
is significantly increased up to 33%. Furthermore, it can be concluded
that the incorporation of FCH with DCP in PLA/PBS
not only improves the Xc of the nanobiocomposite
but also contributes to the growth of α′ crystal of the
PLA phase.

nanobiocomposites.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) Analysis
DSC analysis is carried
out to understand the crystallization and melting behavior of the
fabricated PLA/PBS blend and its ternary nanobiocomposites. In the
present investigation relating the thermal properties of nanobiocomposites,
it is necessary to study the effect of FCH on the
thermal parameters of the PLA/PBS system with or without DCP. The
obtained second heating and cooling curves are depicted in Figure 7a,b, respectively;
the corresponding melting and crystallization parameters are also
mentioned in Figure 7a,b. For neat PLA, second heating scans show glass-transition temperature
(Tg) at 60 °C and cold crystallization
temperature (Tcc) at 115 °C. The
crystallization (Tc) temperature is not
identified during the first cooling scan (at 10 °C/min), which
gives the confirmation that neat PLA shows a slow crystallization
property for being amorphous in nature.29 This finding is in agreement with the wide-angle XRD result also.
Furthermore, neat PLA exhibits double melting peaks and can be explicated
by a similar type of crystal structure that melted at various temperatures
due to lamellar divergence.30,31 For the PLA/PBS blend,
the Tg and Tm of PLA are unchanged, indicating that both are thermodynamically
incompatible.31−33 However, broad Tcc of
the PLA phase is shifted to a lower temperature as blended due to
the dispersed molten PBS content or the presence of contamination
in PBS. Therefore, it can function as a crystallization nucleus for
the PLA system.34 The Tm of PBS is found to be 110.9 °C, and Tccof the PLA component is found to be around 100.9 °C,
which is attributed to the partial overlapping of the melting peak
of PBS with the cold crystallization peak of PLA. On the other hand,
mobility of PBS segments is strongly constrained by PLA chains and
inhibited the PBS crystallization. Therefore, no peak is noticed
for crystallization of PBS during the cooling run. For PLA/PBS-based
ternary nanobiocomposites, the melting peak of PBS is not clearly
observed because it is masked by the cold crystallization region of
PLA. Subsequently, due to the confinement effect, the crystallization
of PBS has been restricted, as mentioned before. Moreover, the presence
of FCH shows no significant change in Tg and Tcc of PLA in the PLA/PBS-based
ternary system in comparison with the PLA/PBS blend. Similarly, Tm of both PLA and PBS was not affected by incorporating FCH, but their melting enthalpy values are reduced with
increasing FCH loading up to 3 wt % due to the reduction
in the volume fraction of the polymer.35

Figure 7 DSC
thermograms of neat PLA, PLA/PBS blend, and their nanocomposites
with and without DCP: (a) second heating cycles and (b) first
cooling cycles.

For PLA/PBS/1DFCH, it is noticed that Tg is
not clearly visible and the relative temperature
at this inflection (Tg) point is found
to be 60 °C. The result shows that the melting peak related to
the PBS phase becomes clear and the reduction in Tm,PLA is observed due to the generation of
imperfect crystals of PLA. For DCP-treated PLA/PBS/1FCH, the decrease in the value of Tm,PLA is probably due to the broad molar mass distribution of
the polymeric matrix by the developed cross-linking sites between
the chains.36 It is observed that the shapes
of the melting endotherms slightly vary when 1 phr DCP content is
added to PLA/PBS/FCH. These data revealed a decrease
of ΔHm,PLA after incorporating DCP
in PLA/PBS/FCH. This also exhibited a notable Tc in the absence of Tcc for the PLA phase, indicating an increment of the crystallization
ability of the amorphous part of PLA from the melt state to cooling
cycle. It probably explained from the interface due to phase separation
where favorable nucleation sites formed for crystal growth.12,25 Other researchers have reported that when the Tc of PLA is higher than 126 °C it crystallizes as
an α-form.37 At a higher loading
of FCH (∼3 wt %), the decrease in Tc of PLA demonstrates that the unreacted parts
of PLA chains have rearranged along with the essential energy to overcome
the reaction barrier, and finally crystal is formed at a lower temperature.38 These data show that the value of ΔHc is also increased, which allows the higher
portion of unreacted PLA chains to undergo rearrangement to form a
crystal.

The percentage crystallinity values of both PLA and
PBS domains
are determined, and their values in nanobiocomposites are summarized
in Table 2. The PLA/PBS
blend depicts percentage crystallinity (Xc) of 24.86% for PLA and 15.72% for the PBS phase. It could be considered
that PBS is more efficient in assisting the crystallization of the
PLA phase. However, the Xc (%) of PBS
is slightly reduced in the presence of PLA content. It is attributed
to the fact that crystallization of PBS is compromised by the PLA
phase. Figure 7 reports
that with the addition of 1 wt % FCH in the PLA/PBS
blend, Xc of PLA content is slightly enhanced,
whereas Xc of PBS is decreased. It is
found that the Xc of PLA is further reduced
on incorporation of FCH especially at a higher loading
(∼3 wt %), whereas crystallinity of the PBS phase remained
unchanged. Conversely, FCH has a tendency to suppress
the crystallization of the PBS phase. With the aid of 1 phr DCP content,
the values of crystallinity of both PLA and PBS are increased from
∼27.15 to 49.01 and ∼0.6 to 4.15%, respectively, in
the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite. For the PLA/PBS/3DFCH nanobiocomposite, it is clear that the Xc of PBS content is not altered significantly, whereas
the crystallinity of PLA is slightly reduced to 43.23%. This implies
the low molecular segment mobility during crystallization.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA) Analysis
Figure 8a displays the TGA plots of PLA/PBS and PLA/PBS/FCH nanobiocomposites with or without DCP, and quantified
parameters are also given in Table 2. All of the film samples show a two-stage degradation
process, revealed by the first derivative thermograms (DTGs) as displayed
in Figure 8b. As mentioned
earlier, the incorporation of 1 wt % FCH into the
PLA/PBS blend shows no significant reduction in molecular weight,
as evidenced by GPC analysis, which is subsequently found to have
less effect on thermal properties. For the PLA/PBS/1FCH nanobiocomposite, TGA results show that T10 (10% weight loss temperature), T50 (50% weight loss temperature), and Tmax (maximum degradation temperature) are varied insignificantly in
comparison to those for the PLA/PBS blend, which may be due to enhanced
compatibility between the PLA and PBS phases in the presence of 1
wt % FCH. However, T90 (90% weight loss temperature) is reduced by ∼6 °C after
addition of FCH as compared to that for the PLA/PBS
blend, which indicates that FCH promotes the degradation
of the PLA/PBS blend at a higher temperature. However, the composite
shows reduction in thermal parameters with a higher loading of FCH (3 wt %) in the PLA/PBS blend. This could be explained
by the increase in the short OLLA chain attached with chitosan that
gives the plasticization effect and finally supports the thermal decomposition
of the polymer composite at a lower temperature.10,36T50 and T90 values for PLA/PBS/1DFCH are shifted to higher
temperatures; however, no significant change in T10 is observed in comparison to that for the PLA/PBS/FCH nanobiocomposite. This suggests that the thermal stability
is enhanced due to the development of some cross-linking/branching
sites at the polymer interface, which control the decomposition process
at a higher temperature.38,39 The high value of the
char yield of the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite
in the high-temperature region is crucial. This indicates that PLA/PBS/1DFCH has good thermal stability. However, in comparison with
the PLA/PBS blend, T10 reduction might
be associated with the polymer chain scission with the initiator (DCP)
and Tm and T50 are merely affected.

Mechanical
Properties
The ultimate tensile strength (TS) of neat PLA
is 48 MPa, and elongation at break (% ε) is 8% due to its brittle
nature. After addition of 20 wt % PBS, the elongation at break is
enhanced up to 14%, whereas tensile modulus (TM) and strength have
dropped. This finding confirms the improvement in ductility of PLA
during the tensile test. The analysis of the mechanical properties
is done to investigate the influence of FCH on the
PLA/PBS blend with or without DCP, including the elongation at break
(%), tensile strength (MPa), and modulus (GPa). Mechanical properties
of all of the strips are displayed in Figure 9a,b. As expected, the elongation at break
is gradually increased from 13 to 24% (approximately 45% increment)
for the PLA/PBS/FCH nanobiocomposite due to the presence
of low-molecular-weight FCH, which has plasticizing
effect. These results indicate that the ductility is improved, which
made it more stretchable in comparison with neat PLA. Meanwhile, the
influence of FCH is detrimental to Young’s
modulus and tensile strength. This could be ascribed to the shorter FCH segments that have the tendency to align faster than
the long polymeric segments under the tensile run.10 Therefore, the presence of shorter polymer chains reduced
the Young modulus and strength, but the calculated tensile strength
is lower in comparison to that of polyethylene (40 MPa).40 However, on further addition of 3 wt % FCH in the PLA/PBS blend, elongation at break is decreased
probably due to agglomeration of FCH but the tensile
strength and modulus almost remain constant. In fact, this is probably
due to the insufficient transfer of stress across the interphases
of either PLA or PBS phase to the FCH due to their
poor interphase adhesion.

Figure 9 Mechanical properties: (a) tensile strength
and elongation at break
(%) and (b) tensile modulus of the PLA-based ternary system with
and without DCP.

When FCH is 1 wt % and DCP content is 1 phr, the
PLA-based ternary nanobiocomposite exhibits balanced mechanical properties.
For the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite, the tensile
strength and modulus are improved and reduction in elongation at break
is noticed in comparison to that of the PLA/PBS/FCH nanobiocomposite. The improvement in the tensile strength
and modulus can be assigned to the formation of some cross-linked/branched
structure, which subsequently led to restrict the mobility of the
polymer chains to dissipate energy under tensile load. However, the
determined value of tensile strength is close to that for polyethylene
(40 MPa) and elongation at break is still higher than that of the
PLA/PBS blend. Hence, the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite
is very useful for the food packaging application. For the PLA/PBS/3DFCH nanobiocomposite, the grafting efficiency is also reduced
due to agglomeration of FCH. This may contribute
to the drop in the elongation at break, but the tensile strength and
modulus are almost constant.

Contact
Angle
A film utilized for the food packaging application
should prevent the food items from humidity during transport to the
consumption stage. The contact angle test is utilized to quantify
the wettability of the solid substrate by depositing a liquid drop
on its surface.41 The estimated values
of static contact angle indicate the relative wettability of PLA,
PLA/PBS blend, and their nanobiocomposites, as shown in Figure 10. This contact
angle is highly relying on the surface tension of the water droplet
and surface energy of the examined film surface. The contact angles
of PLA and PLA/PBS blend are 70 ± 2 and 80 ± 1°, respectively,
which confirms that the PLA/PBS blend is more hydrophobic than neat
PLA. It is a well-known fact that hydrophobic PBS shows weak affinity
toward water molecules, which subsequently leads to enhance the water
resistance of the polymer blend.42 The
addition of FCH into the PLA/PBS blend shows no remarkable
change in the wettability of the PLA/PBS blend, which is due to the
presence of less polar OLLA tails with low polarity tethered to the
hydrophilic chitosan, and thereby maintaining hydrophobicity of the
polymer nanobiocomposite film surface.10,42 For the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite, the static contact angle is enhanced
up to ∼27° in comparison to that of neat PLA, which is
probably due to the combined influence of DCP along with FCH. Furthermore,
it can be suggested that nucleation of the polymer crystallite contributes
to the reduction in polarity of chains, which leads to a higher static
contact angle (89 ± 5°) of the nanobiocomposite film. Another
possible reason of increased hydrophobicity of the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite is probably film roughness.43 Hence, it can be inferred from the contact angle
data of all of the samples that the PLA/PBS/1DFCH
nanobiocomposite shows the highest degree of hydrophobicity, which
is a desirable touchstone in food packaging applications.

hydrophobicity of PLA, PLA/PBS, and PLA/PBS/FCH with
and without DCP.

UV Transmittance
The percentage transmission of PLA/PBS and PLA/PBS/FCH nanobiocomposites with or without DCP is displayed in Figure 11a. The PLA/PBS-based
film is the most transparent, representing the maximum percentage
of transmission in the visible region (400–800 nm). Further
incorporation of FCH into the PLA/PBS blend provokes
a remarkable reduction in the transparency of the nanobiocomposite
in the visible and UV (400–200 nm) regions, which is probably
due to its brownish color.11 This effect
is more pronounced with FCH along with DCP. Subsequently,
at 275 nm, which is related to the UV-C region, the transmittance
values of the PLA/PBS ternary nanobiocomposites decreased 10, 36,
49, and 62% with the incorporation of 1,3 wt % FCH without and with DCP in comparison with those for the PLA/PBS
blend, as seen in Figure 11b. PLA/PBS/1FCH with DCP demonstrates the
maximum UV-blocking influence (250–400 nm) with the lowest
UV-C region. Therefore, this result suggests that the PLA/PBS/FCH nanobiocomposite with DCP has enhanced the UV barrier,
which is an interesting characteristic for the UV-sensitive food packaging
application.

nm)
and (b) comparison of % transmittance at 700, 400, and 275 nm.

Polarized
Optical Microscopy (POM) Analysis
POM investigation for the
spherulite growth patterns developed in PLA/PBS, PLA/PBS/FCH, and PLA/PBS/1DFCH during isothermal crystallization
at 126 and 140 °C is depicted in Figure 12a,b respectively. For all samples, maltese
cross patterns for PLA spherulites have been observed44 and the nucleation density is enhanced gradually with time.
The POM result confirms that the growth of PBS spherulites is not
observed at a temperature above Tc (80
°C) of PBS in the PLA-rich blend. This is probably due to the
fact that PLA macromolecule chains in the PLA/PBS (80/20) blend strongly
inhibited the crystallization of PBS chains.45 In the case of the PLA/PBS blend, large and distinct spherulites
are developed, which show the weak nucleation ability.46 Moreover, the incorporation of FCH into the PLA/PBS blend could slightly improve the nucleation ability.
PLA/PBS/1DFCH displays the strongest nucleation ability,
and after 15 min, spherulites of PLA cover the bulk region. The effect
and differences among the PLA/PBS blend and their nanobiocomposites
in the presence or absence of DCP are clearly noticed after isothermal
crystallization at 140 °C. The growths of spherulites (slope
determined from the spherulite radius (μm) against the crystallization
time (min)) and nucleation density (the total number of spherulites/mm2) are displayed in Figure 12c,d, respectively, for PLA/PBS, PLA/PBS/1FCH, and PLA/PBS/1DFCH at 140 °C. At 140 °C,
the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite represents the
strong nucleation ability, which is due to the generation of the cross-linking/branching
sites, which possibly function as nucleation sites.47−49 Both DSC and
POM analyses confirm that the crystallization of the PLA/PBS blend
is accelerated by the presence of FCH with DCP. According to the studies
of Kim et al.25 and Ji et al.,49 the DSC result confirmed that the developed
cross-linked/branched structures during reactive blending may act
as nucleation sites in the reactive system.

blend and its FCH-based

and growth rate of spherulites and (d) nucleation density (number
of spherulites/mm2) at 140 °C.

Moreover, the growth rate of spherulites of PLA/PBS/1DFCH is inhibited (after 10 min) due to the entanglement
of polymeric
chains, which subsequently led to overlapping of high-density spherulites
and finally deformation in their shapes.47,50 It is found that the lowest crystal size and the highest nuclear
density (maximum number of spherulites/mm2) are noticed
for PLA/PBS/1DFCH. Figure 3Sa,b displays the dependency of the number of spherulites on time at
126 and 140 °C, respectively

Conclusions
The
present investigation provides a simple industrially viable
melt extrusion technique to fabricate a PLA/PBS/FCH-based ternary nanobiocomposite with or without DCP, and the structure
modification is confirmed by FTIR analysis. The surface morphology
study confirms that no PBS droplet is observed in the PLA continuous
phase by incorporating DCP or 1 wt % FCH. Furthermore,
good dispersion of FCH is observed for the PLA/PBS/1DFCH nanobiocomposite in both polymer domains, which helps
in obtaining a balanced set of mechanical properties with improvised
crystallization efficiency. Interestingly, Xc of PLA is enhanced 33 and 27%, as confirmed by wide-angle
XRD and DSC, respectively, for PLA/PBS/1DFCH. Also,
DSC investigation confirms that the crystallization rate of PLA is
increased after the incorporation of DCP in the PLA/PBS/FCH nanobiocomposite, mostly because the developed cross-linked structure
acts as nucleating sites. Furthermore, as evident by POM results,
spherulites formed in the reactive nanobiocomposite are larger in
number and smaller in size than those formed in the PLA/PBS blend
and ternary nanobiocomposite (0% DCP). In addition, the nucleation
density is also the highest, which is referred to the active participation
of FCH in the presence of DCP. For PLA/PBS/1DFCH, the static contact angle is significantly increased
(∼27°) as compared to that of PLA. The remarkable UV-C-blocking
effect of the reactive modified nanobiocomposite may suggest a possible
application toward packaging of UV-sensitive materials.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA) (grade:
4032D, 98.6 of d-lactic and 1.4 of l-lactic acid
unit) with number-average
molecular weight, Mn, ∼ 150 000
Da and polydispersity index, PDI, ∼ 1.3 was purchased from
NatureWorks. Poly(butylene succinate) (grade: 1001MD) with Mn ∼ 88 000 Da and PDI ∼
2.2 was supplied by Showa Highpolymer Singapore Pte. Ltd. (Japan).
Dicumyl peroxide (DCP, purity >99.5%) was purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (India) and used as a radical initiator. Whatmann filter paper
(grade: 1) was used to extract the functionalized chitosan (FCH). Acetone was supplied by SISCO Research Laboratories
(SRL chemicals, India). All of the chemicals have been consumed without
any further purification.

One-Pot
Microwave-Assisted Synthesis of FCH
FCH is produced using microwave-assisted synthesis as reported
elsewhere.10 Both l-lactic acid
and chitosan are mixed in the ratio of 3.33:1 (w/w %) in a round-bottom
flask (RBF) to perform the synthesis of functionalized chitosan. Lactic
acid is mixed manually and completely soaked by hydrophilic chitosan
to enhance the reaction performance. The soaked mixture is placed
inside a microwave oven, and an inert atmosphere inside RBF is generated
by purging N2 gas. The condenser and ice bath are connected
with RBF and are placed outside the microwave in such a way that the
generated byproducts can easily collect in the reservoir. The reaction
termed as “condensation polymerization” is executed
at 240 W and 110 °C for 30 min. The microwave is automatically
stopped after the completion of reaction, and the N2 atmosphere
is broken by closing the gas valve.

A low-molecular-weight oligomer
chain (Mn and Mw values are 1400 and 3000 Da, respectively) has been attached with
the chitosan backbone during the reaction, and finally, a dark brown
viscous product is formed as per the mentioned reaction pathway in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Reaction Pathway
for the Synthesis of Functionalized Chitosan
Thereafter, a fixed amount of FCH is
dissolved
in acetone (20 mL) and stirred at 1000 rpm for 6 h, followed by vacuum
filtration. The supernatant has been discarded, and the remaining
solution is collected for its use in further experimental work.

Preparation
of PLA/PBS/DCP/FCH Nanobiocomposites via the Melt
Extrusion Technique
PLA and PBS pellets are vacuum-dried
at a temperature of 40 °C overnight to remove bound moisture.
DCP (1 phr) is dissolved in acetone (10 mL) and sprayed on the PLA/PBS
(80:20 wt %) blend.9 The DCP-coated PLA/PBS
blend is mixed with filtered FCH (1 and 3 wt %) and
left at room temperature to remove the trapped acetone before processing,
followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Then, PLA/PBS/FCH pellets with or without DCP are melt-mixed using a twin
extruder (HAAKE MiniLab II, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the processing
temperature and screw speed are set as 185 °C and 60 rpm, respectively,
for ∼5 min. Hereafter, PLA/PBS-based composites extruded with
or without DCP having different loadings of FCH (1
and 3 wt %) are labeled as PLA/PBS (80/20), PLA/PBS/1FCH (80/20/1), PLA/PBS/3FCH (80/20/3), PLA/PBS/1DFCH (80/20/1/1), and PLA/PBS/3DFCH (80/20/1/3).
Finally, the extruded strips are used for testing.

Characterization
Techniques
Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Study
IR spectra of samples are
collected by Spectrum FTIR (Frontier, PerkinElmer). These are recorded
in transmission mode with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) assembly.
An extruded strip is placed on a ZnSe-based crystal surface in the
wave number range 4000–600 cm–1 with 16 scans
at a 4 cm–1 resolution for the analysis. A background
spectrum is collected prior to analysis to compensate the influence
of humidity and carbon dioxide present in air by subtracting spectra.

Gel
Content (%)
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade
chloroform is used for the removal of unreacted part because it is
a good solvent for PLA, PBS, and FCH but not appropriate
for cross-linked structure. The amount of gel from the extruded strips
is obtained by washing it in excess chloroform for ∼12 h; after
that, the suspension is vacuum-filtrated and gel is washed several
times to remove the unreacted portion. Finally, the gel is collected
and vacuum-dried at ∼40 °C to remove the chloroform. The
gel fraction (%) is calculated using eq 1 1  where W0 is the initial weight of extruded
strips and Wgel is the final weight of
dried gel obtained after extraction.

Gel
Permeation Chromatography (GPC)
This is used for the analysis
of samples to determine the number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity index (PDI). Samples
(∼40 mg) are dissolved in HPLC-grade chloroform (∼2
mL) for 24 h and filtered prior to analysis.

Field-Emission
Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM)
FESEM (ZEISS) is used
to examine the fracture behavior of the extruded strips at an accelerating
voltage of ∼2–5 kV. After tensile testing, cross sections
of the film strips are mounted on a stub using carbon tape and sputter-coated
with a thin layer of gold for ∼180 s under vacuum before analysis.

Wide-Angle
X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD measurements are carried out
using a diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) equipped with
Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The operating
sources (receiving and diverging slits) are set at 40 kV and 40 mA
at a scan rate of ∼2 s/step in the 2θ range of ∼3–50°.
Film strips are annealed at 60 °C for 6 h prior to analysis.
The diffractogram inbuilt software is used to deduct the peaks, and
the crystallinity indexes (ICR) of polymer
composites are determined using eq 2 2  where Ac and Aa represent the area of
crystalline and amorphous
peaks, respectively.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The calorimetric measurement of
the sample is subjected to DSC (NETZSCH, Germany) equipped with a
liquid nitrogen cylinder required for cooling. The sample is kept
in a platinum crucible, heated from −50 to 200 °C at a
scanning rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen (50 mL/min) atmosphere,
and held in the isothermal state for 2 min at 200 °C to erase
the thermal history. The sample is then cooled to −50 °C
with the same scan rate to understand the crystallization behavior.
Then, it is heated again to 200 °C with the scan rate as that
in the first heating cycle. Indium is used to check the calibration
according to the given standard before sample analysis. For calculating
the percentage of crystallinity (%Xc),
the used standard heats of fusion (ΔHm°) for pure PLA and PBS are 93.0 and 110.0 J/g, respectively.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
Thermal stability of the PLA/PBS blend and
its composites is calculated by TGA (4000 PerkinElmer) to acquire
knowledge about its thermal behavior. The measurement is carried out
in the temperature range of 30–600 °C at 10 °C/min
under a N2 inert atmosphere.

Universal
Testing Machine (UTM)
The mechanical properties (elongation
at break, tensile strength, and modulus) of the strips are measured
using UTM KIC 2-050-C (Kalpak Instruments, India) equipped with a
load cell (500 N) at a speed of 5 mm/min. The dimensions of the specimens
are 50 mm in length and 5 mm in width. Three specimens are tested
for each sample, and the average value is reported with the standard
deviation.

Contact
Angle (CA) Analysis
Hydrophobicity quantification is performed
using a CA analyzer (Krüss DSA25, Germany). The sessile drop
method is used to measure the static contact angle by depositing a
drop of Millipore water on the film substrate at various locations.
The measurement of each sample (∼2 × 2 cm2)
is repeated at least three times, and sufficient time is provided
for the drop to settle before angle measurement.

UV–Visible
Spectrophotometry
Optical transmittance of samples (25 ×
15 mm2) is measured with a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(Lambda 25, PerkinElmer) over the wavelength range 250–1100
nm. The transmittance spectrum is analyzed in the presence of air
as a reference medium.

Polarized
Optical Microscopy (POM)
POM analysis is carried out to investigate
the growth rate of PLA crystals with a POM eclipse (LV100N POL, Nikon
Co., Japan) instrument. The samples (∼0.3 mg) of PLA/PBS, PLA/PBS/FCH, and PLA/PBS/1DFCH are sandwiched between
two glass slides to make a thin film at 190 °C. For POM study,
all of the samples are first melted by a hot stage (Linkam TST350,
Linkam Scientific Instruments, U.K.) at 185 °C with 50 °C/min
and held for 3 minutes. After this, samples are cooled rapidly to
distinct temperatures (i.e., 126 and 140 °C) with the same rate
and placed at isothermal conditions for 20 min. These hold temperatures
would detect the influence of DCP along with FCH
on PLA crystals.
