Eco-friendly and good-performance
resin adhesives are needed for
wood manufacturing. In this study, phenol–urea–formaldehyde
(PUF) resin adhesives were modified by adding various ratios of resorcinol.
The properties of PUF, phenol–resorcinol–urea–formaldehyde
(PRUF) resin adhesives, and the performances of the prepared plywood
were tested. The curing behaviors and the structural features of the
PUF and PRUF resin adhesives were investigated via dynamic scanning
calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, 13C NMR, and
cross polarization magic angle spinning 13C NMR. The results
indicated that 1.3% resorcinol (based on resin, w/w) could decrease
the curing temperature and accelerate the curing process after PUF
resin modification. The PRUF resin adhesives demonstrated a lower
activation energy during the curing process, with up to 28.8% less
energy than that of PUF resin adhesive without any curing agent. The
plywood demonstrated low formaldehyde emissions (<0.1 mg L–1) and acceptably high bonding strengths (>1.00
MPa).
This work provided a method for preparing an easy-cured and high-performance
phenolic resin for wood manufacturing.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Adhesives are vital ingredients
for the manufacturing of wood-based
composite panels, including plywood, oriented strand board, medium-density
fiberboard, and laminated veneer lumber.1,2 Urea–formaldehyde
(UF) adhesive, phenol–formaldehyde (PF) adhesive, and melamine–formaldehyde
(MF) adhesive are the commonly used conventional thermosetting wood
adhesives. The UF resin adhesive is a cheap and colorless adhesive
that is typically used in an interior application. UF resin has poor
water resistance and higher formaldehyde emission, which is harmful
to human health and environment.3,4 The MF resin adhesive
is more expensive, as it is water resistant and has good thermostability.
This adhesive is ideal for exterior and semi-exterior use.2,5 The formaldehyde emission is lower compared with that of UF resin
adhesive, but the curing temperature of the MF resin adhesive is relatively
high. The PF resin adhesive creates strong bonds to resist solvents
and aging, and is commonly used for large scale projects.6 This adhesive has a high curing temperature and
a lengthy curing time during the manufacturing of wood panels. These
three conventional adhesives each have their own defects that could
be enhanced by modification.

Urea has partially replaced phenol
when producing the co-condensed
phenol–urea–formaldehyde (PUF) resin.7,8 The
addition of urea to the PF resin significantly increases the reactivity
and reduces manufacturing costs.9 The increased
urea content would negatively affect the stability of the resin, which
could result in poor water resistance and bonding strength. A few
research studies have been reported about the additive amount of urea.10−12 The co-condensation between phenol, urea, and formaldehyde would
cause a series of complicated reactions, which could affect the molecular
structure of the resin, the curing process, and the performances of
wood panels. Some PUF resin adhesives were modified by adding tannins.
However, tannins with a high reactivity with formaldehyde and a large
molecular size could result in a weak polymeric structure.13

The carbonates and bivalent metal oxides
have been shown as catalysts
to accelerate the curing time for PUF resins. The wood bonding properties
performed well at higher hot pressing temperature, which could ameliorate.14 Moreover, most of these inorganic salts and
inorganic oxides demonstrate poor solubility or dispersity in aqueous
phenolic resins, so the usage ratio of these resin additives remains
relatively low.15 Furthermore, many additives
for hardening acceleration were used in the glue mix, such as organic
esters,10 carbonate,16 organic anhydrides,17 isocyanates,18 and aldehyde.19 The
synthesis processes of resins with these additives were not ideal,
resulting in the ordinary performances of the adhesives. These additives
are effective but have not been applied on a large scale for wood
panel manufacturing. Some research has focused on the nanoparticles,
in an attempt to obtain a better reinforcement results, including
nanofibrils,20 nanocupric oxide,21 nanosilica,22 nanoclay,23 and alumina nanoparticle.15 However, these nanometer materials require premixing with
resin adhesives via mechanical agitation or ultrasonic agitation for
at least 30 min, which limits their use.

To reduce the harmful
gas emissions of these formaldehyde-based
adhesives, various studies have turned attention to formaldehyde-free
adhesives, such as soybean-based adhesives and isocyanate adhesives.
Soybeans are renewable and sustainable materials that have been used
to supersede petrochemical-based products. The conventional soybean-based
adhesive is both nontoxic and economical. Unfortunately, this adhesive
has poor water resistance because of the multifarious amino acid compositions
and multilevel structures of soybeans.24 Many methods have been used to modify soybean, including acid, alkali,
organic solvents, detergents, urea, enzymatic agents, and exposure
to heat.25 These methods complicate the
manufacturing technique and increase the production cost. The wood
bonding strength met type II plywood, according to the Chinese National
Standard (GB/T 17657-2013), and the solid content of the soybean-based
adhesive was mostly under 37%. More energy was required for the curing
process of the soybean-based adhesive as a result of the low solid
content.26−29 Isocyanate adhesives were used as formaldehyde-free adhesives to
demonstrate excellent bond performances in wood manufacturing.30 However, isocyanate is toxic to human health,
which forces the factories to build a secure environment, resulting
in expensive production costs.

Resorcinol is an aromatic compound
(1,3-dihydroxy benzene) that
is used directly in the synthesis of resin adhesives with phenol and
formaldehyde. Only adhesives containing resorcinol have been used
for some applications requiring ambient temperature setting or curing.
This is due to the fact that resorcinol accelerates and improves the
crosslinking of phenolic resin at low temperatures. The resorcinol-containing
adhesives have good waterproof and durability performances.31 These phenol–resorcinol–formaldehyde
resins are typically made by manufacturing a PF resin and then modifying
it with resorcinol.32 The plywood that
is glued with these cold-setting resin adhesives require lengthy pressing
times exceeding 24 h.33

In this study,
resorcinol was firstly used to marginally replace
phenol during the synthesis process of co-condensed PUF resins, to
decrease the curing temperature and accelerate the curing of resins.
The adhesive properties and the plywood performances were measured.
To better understand the chemical structure, the curing behavior,
and their relationship between the cure-accelerated phenol–resorcinol–urea–formaldehyde
(PRUF) resins, the dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric
analysis (TGA), 13C NMR, and cross polarization magic angle
spinning (CP-MAS 13C NMR) were used to investigate the
structural features and curing characteristics.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
Phenol (99%), formaldehyde
aqueous solution (37%), solid urea (99%), sodium hydroxide (96%),
and resorcinol (99%) were of analytical grade and were used without
further purification.

2.2 Synthesis of PUF and PRUF
Resins
The synthesis of the PUF and PRUF resins were performed
in a round
flask with three necks provided with a thermometer, a magnetic stirrer,
and a reflux condenser. Phenol, urea, 37% formaldehyde water solution,
and sodium hydroxide were prepared in the laboratory with a molar
proportion of 1.0:1.2:3.2:1.2 via two-step reactions. In the first
step, phenol and half of the formaldehyde were initially placed in
the reaction flask, where 33.3% sodium hydroxide solution was gradually
added to adjust the pH to 12 after constant stirring. The system was
heated to 90 °C and maintained at this temperature for 40 min.
A moiety of urea was blended into the compound and allowed to react
for 1 h.

During the second step, the remainder of the formaldehyde
and 33.3% sodium hydroxide solution were added to the compound. Resorcinol
was a substitute for 0% (PUF) to 10% (PRUF) (w/w) of phenol, which
meant the highest rate based on the resin was 1.3% (w/w). Resorcinol
was slowly added under a temperature range between 80 and 90 °C.
After a period, the temperature of the mixture was decreased to 65
°C, and the rest of the urea was blended into the compound for
30 min. The resulting resins were cooled to room temperature before
use. Various reaction conditions performed are listed in Table 1.

2.3 Three-Layer Plywood Manufacture and Testing
The performances
of the PUF and PRUF resins were tested via preparing
laboratory plywood and evaluating the formaldehyde emission and bonding
strength in accordance with the Chinese National Standard (GB/T 17657-2013).
Duplicate three-layer laboratory plywood panels (400 mm × 400
mm × 4.5 mm) were prepared using PUF or PRUF resin adhesives
and poplar veneers without any curing agent. All these adhesives were
mixed with 20% wheat flour as the filler. The glue spread was 316
g m–2 of double glue line, that was hot pressed
for 243 s (54 s mm–1) or 405 s (90 s mm–1) at 135 °C, and with 1 MPa of pressing pressure. Following
hot pressing, the plywood was stored in an ambient environment for
24 h prior to testing.

2.4 Dynamic Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC)
DSC analysis of the uncured freeze-dried adhesives
was performed
on a Shimazu DSC-60A (Japan) under a nitrogen atmosphere with a flow
rate of 50 mL min–1. High-pressure aluminum hermetic
pans, which could withstand vapor pressure up to 0.3 MPa, were used
to prevent the components of the samples from evaporating at high
temperatures. About 4 mg of the samples were used in each test. Scans
were run at heating rates of 5, 10, and 15 °C min–1 and the scanning temperature ranged from 30 to 200 °C.

2.5 Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)
Thermal stabilities
of the cured PUF and PRUF resins were measured
with TA Instruments TGA Q50 that operated from 25 to 700 °C at
10 °C min–1. The PUF and PRUF resins were cured
at 120 °C for 2 h to circumvent water adsorption.34 The nitrogen flow rate for all the samples was
60 mL min–1. About 7 mg of the resin samples were
used for each test in a platinum crucible. Curves of the weight loss
and the derivative weight loss (differential thermogravimetry (DTG))
were plotted.

2.6 13C NMR Spectra
Eighty
milligrams of freeze-dried uncured adhesives were dissolved in 0.5
mL of D2O for NMR shifts control for solution-state 13C NMR analysis. The spectra were obtained on a Bruker AV-III
400 MHz spectrometer (Germany) at 25 °C. The solid-state CP-MAS 13C NMR spectra were acquired at 100 MHz, on a Bruker AV-III
400 MHz spectrometer (Germany). The cured adhesives were prepared
by treating the uncured adhesives at 120 °C for 2 h in an air
convection oven. The uncured and cured adhesive powders were packed
into a zirconium oxide rotor sealed with a Kel-F cap for analysis.
The acquisition time was 0.01 s with a number of transients, approximately
5000 for each experiment.35

a Standard deviation.

The solid content and the pH of each PUF and PRUF resin adhesive
met the requirements defined by the Chinese National Standard (GB/T
14732-2006). The viscosity of the PUF and some PRUF resin adhesives
with a lower percentage of resorcinol accretion was less than the
requirement of the Chinese National Standard (GB/T 14732-2006). It
is well-known that controlling the viscosity of the adhesive has a
great influence on its adhesion strength in wood panels. A low viscosity
demonstrates a small molecular weight, which can result in a weak
strength of plywood.36,37 The adhesives from PRUF4 to PRUF7
showed that both increasing the reaction time and the temperature
could enhance the viscosity to reach the Chinese National Standard.

The formaldehyde emissions of all the plywood were below 0.5 mg
L–1 and reached the requirement of E0 grade (≤0.5 mg L–1) as specified
by the Chinese National Standard (GB/T 9846.3-2004). The plywood prepared
with the PRUF5 resin adhesive exhibited the lowest formaldehyde emission
(0.01 mg L–1). This plywood can be directly used
in an interior application, which is beneficial to human health and
inner environment. The bonding strength of the plywood bonded using
PUF and PRUF resin adhesives met the requirements of the exterior-grade
panels (first grade, ≥0.7 MPa) at a bonding time of 405 s.
However, there was a weak bonding strength when the accretion of resorcinol
was less than 1.3%. The actual result indicated that the plywood bonded
with PURF5 to PURF9 resin adhesives exhibited good bonding performances
with the 243 s bonding time, which reached the Chinese National Standard
(GB/T 17657-2013). The plywood prepared with the PRUF6 resin adhesive
demonstrated the best bonding strength (1.50 MPa). This plywood can
be directly used in an exterior application to resist a humid environment.
Among these, the PRUF5, 6, 7, and 9 resin adhesives with the 243 s
bonding time showed a similar or even superior bonding results than
the PUF resin adhesive with the 405 s bonding time. Therefore, it
was confirmed that the addition of 1.3% resorcinol (based on resin,
w/w) could reduce the curing time of the PUF resin adhesive. The plywood
prepared with these PRUF resin adhesives demonstrated superior bonding
performances relative to some significant studies that were eco-friendly
and widely utilized.10,11,38 The following analyses of the PRUF resin adhesives were conducted
from the PURF5 to the PRUF9.

3.2 Dynamic Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC) of PUF
and PRUF Resins
The curing temperature of the adhesive is
a significant parameter in wood manufacturing. If the plywood is pressed
at a lower temperature, the phenolic resin will not have a complete
condensation. Inversely, if the plywood is pressed at a higher temperature,
there will be many apertures in the resins, which can destroy the
wood fiber structure since the volatile matter cannot deviate from
the panels. Therefore, the wood panels should be prepared at an adequate
pressing temperature, which is quantified with the curing temperature
of resin via DSC analysis.

To compare the curing processes of
the different PUF and PRUF resin adhesives, the DSC kinetic analysis
started by obtaining the kinetic parameters from the peak temperature
of the DSC scanning curves that were conducted at various heating
rates. The peak temperatures of the PUF and PRUF resin adhesives at
various heating rates are listed in Table 4. The characteristic curing temperature were
determined by the peak temperature of the first exothermal peak obtained
from the nonisothermal DSC measurements at various heating rates through
linear regression analysis. The intercept at a heating rate of 0 °C
min–1 denoted the characteristic curing temperature
under isothermal conditions.39,40 As given in Table 4, the characteristic
curing temperatures of the PRUF resin adhesives were all lower than
that of the PUF resin adhesive. The results turned out that the addition
of resorcinol could reduce the curing temperature without any hardener
agent.

d The values in parentheses represent
the regression coefficients.

The activation energy was calculated by the dependence of the peak
temperature at various heating rates via the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa
and Kissinger methods. The results are listed in Table 4.41 The Ek values were similar to Ef values. The regression coefficients were more than 0.98 for
each of the regression calculations, which manifested credible and
consistent results for both methods. The data in Table 4 indicated that the activation
energy of the PRUF resin adhesives was lower than that of the PUF
resin adhesive, which was in agreement with the variation of curing
temperatures. The PRUF6 resin presented the lowest activation energy,
which could reduce 28.8% more than the PUF resin. This reduction was
likely due to the higher chemical activity of resorcinol with the
two phenolic hydroxyls, which possessed strong electron-donor conjugated
functions. The lower activation energy signified that the resin had
an effortless curing process. Among PRUF resin adhesives, the PRUF6
exhibited the lowest curing temperature and activation energy, which
demonstrated good bonding performances, as presented in Table 3.

3.3 Thermal
Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) of PUF
and PRUF Resins
The TGA and DTG curves of the cured PUF and
PRUF resin adhesives are represented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
These PRUF resin adhesives had different reaction temperatures during
the second step. The temperature where the maximum degradation took
place (Tmax) in various thermal events
of the cured PUF and PRUF resins, as well as the weight residues at
700 °C, are provided in Table 5. There were four main mass loss events during thermal
degradation, which was more complicated with respective to those of
conventional PF resins.42 The initial stage
of weight loss between 200 and 322 °C corresponded to the post
curing reactions of the phenolic resin. The result was also confirmed
by an endotherm in the DSC curves. The weight loss included the evaporation
of water, formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, phenol, and cresol. These
formed via the condensation between the methylol groups, the breaking
of the methylol groups, and the methylene bridge breakdown that lead
to further crosslinking.34,43 Weight loss (13–15%)
of PUF and PRUF was observed at this stage, which could reflect the
degree of the condensation reaction. There would be a drastic reaction
at the maximum degradation temperature, as shown in Table 5. Generally speaking, the pressing
temperature of the plywood panels should be set prior to the maximum
(Tmax in the first stage). Among the PUF
and PRUF resin adhesives, the PRUF6 and PRUF7 presented lower Tmax values than that of the PUF. This result
validated that resorcinol could reduce the curing temperature.

PRUF9	277.2	322.3	385.7	510.9	56.1	
The second and the third stage occurred in the temperature
range
between 322–365 and 365–450 °C, respectively. Degradation
took place in these two steps and was thought to arise from the breakdown
of methylene linkages and the loss of water that was produced from
the condensation reaction between phenolic −OH and methylene
and between the two hydroxyl functional groups. The ligand in the
resin decomposed entirely into volatile products. The DTG of PRUF
resins were visibly slower than that of the PUF resin displayed in Figures 2 and 3. There was a higher thermal stability during this stage.
The fourth thermal event ranged between 450 and 588 °C. The crosslinking
of the methylene with the carbon-hydrogen crosslinks led to hydrogen
elimination with the formation of carbon monoxide and methane.34,43−45

3.4 Solution-State 13C NMR of Uncured
Resin Adhesives
The chemical structures of the PUF and PRUF
resin adhesives were studied by employing a solution-state 13C NMR spectrum of the uncured adhesives after being freeze-dried. Figure 4 shows the 13C NMR spectra of the PUF and PRUF resin adhesives. The spectrum of
the PUF resin adhesive was similar to those of the PRUF5 through PRUF9
resin adhesives. The series of peaks between 160.7 and 162.7 ppm are
attributed to the urea’s C=O groups in the branched
resin spectra. The carbonyl peak at 161.0 ppm indicated that part
of the urea did not react. In addition, the disubstituted urea was
of 162.7 ppm (−CH2–urea–CH2).33,46 The PUF and PRUF resins were synthesized
with the beginning of the reaction between phenol and formaldehyde.
Thus, the addition of a small quantity of urea reacted sufficiently
to reduce the emission of formaldehyde in the final resin adhesives.
The dominant signals around 127.6 ppm represent the free meta sites
(C–H) and the para, ortho reacted sites (C–C) of the
aromatic nucleus in resorcinol and phenol. The signals at 120 and
116 ppm, respectively, belong to the unreacted para, ortho sites (C–H)
of the phenolic −OH in the aromatic ring, which was not observed
previously.10 Thus, the para, ortho sites
of the aromatic rings completely reacted with the resorcinol and phenol. Figure 4 shows that PRUF6
and PRUF7 resins had a weaker signal at 127.6 ppm compared with other
resins. This is due to the fact that the meta sites were partially
substituted when the resin is synthesized in a longer reaction time,
as shown in Table 2. The chemical shifts of the formaldehyde from 80 to 100 ppm were
not observed in Figure 4, indicating that the formaldehyde reacted sufficiently. Similarly,
the signals from 71 to 76 ppm were also not observed. These signals
are assigned to the methylene ether linkages which could break and
release formaldehyde at high temperatures. Therefore, the PUF and
the PRUF5 to PRUF9 resin adhesives had an extremely low formaldehyde
emission, as shown in Table 3.

Figure 4 Solution-state 13C NMR spectra of the uncured PUF and
PRUF resin adhesives.

The peak at 61.5 ppm is attributed to the ortho methylol
group
of the phenol (o-Ph–CH2OH). The
small signal at 46.3 ppm corresponds to the co-condensed methylene
group (o-Ph–CH2–N(CH2−)CO−), where the PRUF9 resin was slightly higher.47 The signals at 39.6 and 34.6 ppm belong to the
methylene linkages between phenolic units, the former for a p,p-Ph–CH2–Ph,
and the second for an o,p-Ph–CH2–Ph. The peak at 39.6 ppm was higher than the peak
at 34.6 ppm for the PUF resin. This is attributed to the superior
reactivity of the aromatic hydrogen at the para site of the phenolic
−OH rather than that at the ortho site. At the initial stage
of the resin synthesis process, a hydroxymethylated reaction took
place at the para site of the phenolic −OH within phenol. The
following condensation reaction easily took place between the para
methylol group and the unreacted para site of the phenolic −OH
in the phenol. Therefore, a large proportion of the para sites of
the phenolic −OH were consumed to form para–para methylene
bonds.10

3.5 CP-MAS 13C NMR of Uncured and Cured
Resin Adhesives
The curing behaviors of the PUF and PRUF
resin adhesives were explored by analyzing the uncured and cured resin
adhesives via solid-state CP-MAS 13C NMR. Figures 5 and 6 display the spectra of the uncured and cured resin adhesives, respectively.
The signal assignments of the PUF resin adhesive were similar to the
PRUF resin adhesives, despite being uncured or cured. The new spectra
signals around 79 ppm are attributed to spinning sidebands. Furthermore,
the peak around 61.3 ppm decreased slightly compared with the signals
of all resin adhesives before curing. This was caused by the methylene
bridges between phenolic ring breaking during the curing process.
This implied that the main reaction of the curing process was the
condensation reaction between the ortho methylol groups and the remaining
unreacted ortho and para sites.35 In addition,
the signals of the formaldehyde around 80–100 ppm were not
observed in the spectra of the cured resin adhesives, as shown in Figure 6, which was in agreement
with the results shown in Table 3.

4 Conclusions
The eco-friendly plywood
was successfully prepared with these PRUF
resin adhesives, based on the proposed formulation. The cost of resorcinol
and the performances of the resin adhesives were taken into account
in determining that the addition of resorcinol was feasible at a 1.3%
(based on resin, w/w) substitution rate. The ortho and para sites
of resorcinol reacted completely when they were added at the beginning
of the second stage, rather than simply mixing them with the phenolic
resins. The thermodynamic studies indicated that the additional resorcinol
could reduce the activation energy of resin up to 28.8% more than
the PUF resin adhesive without any curing agent. The PRUF resin adhesives
exhibited better performances for decreasing the curing temperature
and accelerating the curing process of resins. In this study, the
plywood prepared with PRUF resin adhesives exhibited low formaldehyde
emissions (<0.1 mg L–1) and acceptably high bonding
strengths (>1.00 MPa). The PRUF resin adhesives, therefore, have
a
great potential use in wood panels prepared with agricultural and
forest residues.
