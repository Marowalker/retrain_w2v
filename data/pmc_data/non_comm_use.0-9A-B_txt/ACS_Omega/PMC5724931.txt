Stereoselective
total syntheses of the four stereoisomeric forms
of guaiacylglycerol 8-O-4′-coniferyl ether,
viz., compounds 1, ent-1, 2, and ent-2, have been
established. The key step involves an Evans/Seebach auxiliary-controlled
and syn-selective aldol process followed, in the reaction sequences
leading to the anti-compounds, by a Mitsunobu reaction involving a
benzylic alcohol residue. The proangiogenic properties of the synthetic
materials were evaluated in a human microvascular endothelial cell
tubule formation assay, thus revealing that they are all active, with
the 8S-configured compounds 1 and 2 being
the most potent.

Introduction
Compounds that promote
the formation
of new blood vessels from existing endothelia are described as proangiogenic
and could be beneficial in promoting wound healing, treating burns,
and the revascularization of ischemic tissues encountered in stroke
victims and those suffering from cardiac disorders.1 Screening plant extracts for such properties is an emerging
area of interest and the rat aortic ring model and related assays
have proven useful in identifying natural products that can modulate
angiogenesis.2,3 By such means, various extracts
of soybean (particularly the xylem sap) were evaluated recently, and
two proangiogenic principals were isolated.3 Although only small quantities of these materials were obtained, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic as well as mass spectral
analyses suggested that these are one or other of the neolignans 1 or ent-1 and 2 or ent-2.3 The racemic forms of these compounds have previously been isolated
from various other plant sources and shown to exhibit a range of biological
effects.4 They are almost certainly produced
in vivo through peroxidase-mediated radical coupling of coniferyl
alcohol, and optically enriched forms of them (but of undefined absolute
stereochemistry) have been generated by enzymatic dehydrogenative
coupling of this monomer using cell-free extracts of a producing organism.5

Given the very small amounts of these compounds
available from
natural sources, the seasonal variations in their yields, and the
lack of information regarding their stereostructures (and, in many
instances, their optical purities), unambiguous syntheses of the guaiacylglycerol
8-O-4′-coniferyl ethers 1, ent-1, 2, and ent-2 were sought in an effort to clarify matters. Herein,
we detail the total syntheses of each of these four stereoisomeric
8-O-4′-linked neolignans6,7 and
report on their proangiogenic properties (Figure 1).

ether targeted for synthesis.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses of the Racemic Forms of Compounds 1 and 2
Although many neolignans have
been the subject
of synthetic studies,8 enantioselective
approaches to 8-O-4′ linked systems, as required
in accessing the compounds targeted here, have received only modest
attention.9,10 Our first approach to compounds 1, ent-1, 2, and ent-2 is shown in Scheme 1, and in this we sought, inter alia, to exploit
key elements of Ley’s asymmetric synthesis of the 8-O-4′ neolignan polysphorin.9a This started with the conversion, by conventional means, of commercially
available ferulic acid (3) over four steps into bis-methoxymethyl
(MOM) ether 4 (79%) (see Experimental
Section for details). Asymmetric dihydroxylation of the olefinic
residue within compound 4 using AD-mix-α and methanesulfonamide
afforded the diol 5 (78%), the configuration of which
was assigned using the Sharpless “mnemonic”.11 Although the enantiomeric excess (ee) of this
oxidation product was not established, the fact that it was optically
active {[α]D + 10.7 (c = 1.02, CHCl3)} encouraged us to continue exploring the reaction sequence,
the next step of which involved selective oxidation of the benzylic
hydroxyl group within compound 5 using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone
(DDQ) under ultrasonication conditions.12 By such means, the acyloin 6 (86%) was obtained and
the associated hydroxyl group was reacted with p-toluenesulfonic
anhydride in the presence of pyridine, thus giving the optically active
ester 7 in 93% yield. Although treating this last compound
with coniferyl aldehyde (8) in the presence of cesium
carbonate and 18-crown-6 (18-C-6) led to the formation of the anticipated
8-O-4′-linked ether 9 (47%),
this proved to be an optically inactive material, thus suggesting
racemization of substrate 7 and/or the product had occurred
under the reaction conditions.1 Despite this,
the completion of the synthetic pathway was pursued because of the
capacity it provided to deliver the racemic forms of the target compounds
(materials that would prove useful in establishing the enantiomeric
excesses of their enantiomerically enriched congeners). So, compound 9 was treated with a trace of concentrated HCl in isopropanol,
thus effecting cleavage of the MOM-ether residues, and thereby affording
the dihydroxy-derivative 10 (76%). The required 2-fold
reduction of the keto-aldehyde 10 was best effected using
polymer-supported borohydride9a and, in
a presumably sterically driven process, this gave a ca. 7:1 mixture
of the diastereoisomeric syn- and anti-compounds (±)-1 and (±)-2, respectively, in 87% combined yield.
These could be separated from one another using reverse phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the spectral data derived from each
were in complete accord with those reported earlier4e,4l for the natural products (see Table 1 for relevant comparisons of the 13C NMR
data sets).

Although
each of the synthetically derived compounds (±)-1 and (±)-2 could be separated into their
constituent enantiomers using chiral HPLC techniques, the equivalent
analysis of the soybean-derived natural products could not be carried
out due to their decomposition on prolonged (>12 months) standing
(as a crude extract). That said, when samples of these compounds have
been isolated from other plant sources, they tend to be obtained as
racemates or, at best, enantiomerically enriched (but certainly not
homochiral) materials.5a

Chiral Auxiliary-Controlled
Syntheses of Homochiral Compounds 1 and ent-1
The synthetic
route successfully employed in obtaining neolignan ent-1 is shown in Scheme 2 and involved, as the key feature, an Evans’
aldol reaction13 utilizing the readily
available l-valine (11)-derived chiral auxiliary 12 introduced by Seebach.14 This
was coupled with the eugenol (13)-derived and readily
available α-aryloxyacetic acid 14 (85%) through
its conversion into the corresponding acid chloride and reaction of
this with the anion derived from deprotonation of the 2-oxazolidinone 12 using n-butyl lithium. Compound 15 (93%) so formed was then converted, on treatment with dibutylboron
triflate in the presence of Hünig’s base,14a into the corresponding boron enolate that reacted
stereoselectively with aldehyde 16 embodying a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS)-protected phenol residue.
The auxiliary associated with the aldol product so-formed was cleaved
using lithium borohydride/methanol, thus affording the 1°-alcohol 17 (76% from 15) as a single diastereoisomer
and in optically active form {[α]D = −63.3
(c = 0.8, CHCl3)}. The illustrated structure
was initially assigned to compound 17 on the basis of
the well-established syn-selective outcomes of Evans’ aldol
reactions9h,13,14 involving
the types of auxiliaries used here, but eventually it was confirmed
through chemical correlation studies (see below). Aerobic and palladium-catalyzed
acetoxylation of compound 17 using a procedure reported
by Stahl et al.15 and employing 4,5-diazafluorenone
as ligand then afforded ester 18 in 48% yield and exclusively
in the E-isomeric form. Cleavage of both the acetate and silyl ether
residues associated with compound 18 was accomplished
using potassium carbonate in methanol, thus giving the target neolignan ent-1 in 79% yield.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Compound ent-1
All of the mass spectral as well as the NMR and IR spectroscopic
data acquired on compound ent-1 matched
those derived from the corresponding racemate [(±)-1], and the specific rotation determined for the optically active
material was −36.7 (c = 0.9, methanol). Chiral
HPLC analysis of compound ent-1 established
that it was of >99% enantiomeric excess and represents the less
mobile
component of the racemate (±)-1.

The synthesis
of compound 1 was readily achieved following
the reaction scheme shown above but using the auxilliary ent-12 derived from d-valine (ent-11). Although all of the spectral data recorded on
neolignan 1 matched those reported for its enantiomer,
the specific rotation of this material was of similar magnitude but
opposite sign {[α]D = +32.4 (c =
0.2, methanol)}. Chiral HPLC analysis of compound 1 established
that it had been obtained in ca. 90% ee and represents the more mobile
component of the racemate (±)-1 obtained earlier.

The synthesis of the anti-compound ent-2 is shown in Scheme 3 and involved, in the opening stages, selective mono-protection of
the 1°-alcohol residue within compound 17 followed
by cleavage of the associated phenolic TBDMS ether. This gave phenol 19 (96%) that was reacted with p-toluenesulfonyl
chloride (p-TsCl) in the presence of triethyamine
and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine
(DMAP) to afford ester 20 (87%). The introduction of
the tosyl group was necessary to attenuate the electron-donating properties
of the attached aryl oxygen such that this now did not facilitate
ionization of activated forms of the benzylic alcohol during the subsequent
Mitsunobu reaction.16 Consistent with such
expectations, when compound 20 was treated with triphenylphosphine
and diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD), and using p-nitrobenzoic
acid as nucleophile, benzoate 21 (84%) was obtained.
Confirmation of the illustrated S-configuration at the PNB-ester bearing
center in this product follows from its conversion into the target
neolignan ent-2. To such ends, treatment
of compound 21 with sodium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran
(THF)/water afforded the alcohol 22 (74%) that was itself
subjected to allylic oxidation using Stahl’s protocol,15 thereby affording acetate 23 in
64% yield.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Compound ent-2
Treatment of ester 23 with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) then
sodium hydroxide in water/methanol
resulted in cleavage of the TBDMS ether, acetate, and tosyl groups
such that the targeted neolignan ent-2 was obtained in 73% yield. All of the spectral data obtained on
this material were consistent with the assigned structure. Chiral
HPLC analysis established that it was of >99% ee. The specific
rotation
of this material was [α]20D = −8.1
(c = 1.1, methanol), and it represents the more mobile
component of the racemate (±)-2.

The synthesis
of compound 2 was readily achieved following
the reaction scheme shown but using compound ent-17 as starting material. Although all of the spectral data
recorded on neolignan 2 matched those reported for its
enantiomer, the specific rotation of this material was of similar
magnitude but opposite sign {[α]20D =
+7.4 (c = 0.5, methanol)}. Similarly, chiral HPLC
analysis of compound 2 established that it was of >99%
ee and that it represents the less mobile component of the racemate
(±)-2 obtained as described above.

To this
point, the assignments of the illustrated structures to
compounds 1, ent-1, 2, and ent-2 are based on the
assumption that the pivotal Evans’ aldol reactions proceed
in the anticipated (syn-selective) manner and that the Mitsunobu reactions
take place with inversion of configuration. Further support follows
from the recent work of Nair et al.,9k who
employed closely related Evans’ aldol protocols to prepare
compound 2 and who undertook certain chemical correlation
studies and a single-crystal X-ray analysis to establish the selectivities
of their pivotal reaction. The NMR spectroscopic data we acquired
on compound 2 matched those reported by Nair.9k

Initial Biological Evaluations of Compounds 1, ent-1, 2, and ent-2
Compounds 1 and 2 as well as their enantiomers, ent-1 and ent-2, respectively, were
each
examined for their abilities to enhance endothelial cell tubule formation
on reconstituted basement membrane matrix (see Figure 2 and the Experimental Section) in an assay widely used to identify proangiogenic and antiangiogenic
factors and their underlying mechanism(s) of action.17

Figure 2 Effect of neolignans 1, ent-1, 2, and ent-2 on tubule formation by human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs)
on reconstituted basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) over a 4 h period
compared with that of media (only) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2
(positive) controls as well as when coadministered with the MEK1/2
inhibitor PD (PD98059). The columns represent the mean of the means
of 4 independent experiments with each condition performed in triplicate.
Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Statistical significance
was determined by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
test (compared with media only, i.e., MCDB131 medium with supplements
and 0.2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) using GraphPad Prism software,
where **** denotes P < 0.0001, *** denotes P < 0.001, * denotes P < 0.05, ns
denotes not significant, and † denotes significance at P < 0.01 between FGF-2 and compound 1. There
was no significant difference between FGF-2 and compounds 2, ent-1, or ent-2.

All four compounds stimulated
endothelial cell tubule formation
compared with media only, with compounds 1 and 2 being the most active and congener ent-2 the least active. It is noteworthy that each of these neolignans
exhibited significant proangiogenic activity compared with media only,
with compound 1 being more active than the fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF-2) control.18 The
flavone derivative PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MEK1/2) and FGF-2 signaling, suppressed the proangiogenic
activity of all of the compounds, which is consistent with the title
neolignans acting via this pathway.

Conclusions
The
work detailed here provides stereochemically unambiguous routes
to a quartet of neolignans that display varying degrees of activity
as proangiogenic agents. The variation in efficacy as a function of
stereochemistry indicates that the S-configuration at C8 (as seen
in neolignans 1 and 2) has a positive impact
on activity, with compound 1 being even more active than
the FGF-2 control. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents
the first time that a suite of diastereisomerically related neolignans
has been identified as proangiogenic agents. As such, it should serve
as an important consideration for the development of proangiogenic
compounds that might serve as therapeutic agents.

Experimental
Section
General Protocols
Unless otherwise specified, proton
(1H) and carbon (13C) NMR spectra were recorded
at room temperature in base-filtered CDCl3 on a Varian
spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for proton and 100 MHz for carbon
nuclei. The signal due to residual CHCl3 appearing at δH 7.26 and the central resonance of the CDCl3 triplet
appearing at δC 77.1(6) were used to reference 1H and 13C NMR spectra, respectively. 1H NMR data are recorded as follows: chemical shift (δ) [multiplicity,
coupling constant(s) J (Hz), relative integral] where
multiplicity is defined as: s = singlet; d = doublet; t = triplet;
q = quartet; m = multiplet or combinations of the above. Infrared
spectra (νmax) were recorded on a Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer. Samples were analyzed as thin films on KBr
plates or as neat material. Low-resolution electrospray ionization
(ESI) mass spectra were recorded on a single quadrupole liquid chromatograph-mass
spectrometer, whereas high-resolution measurements were conducted
on a time-of-flight instrument. Low- and high-resolution electron
ionization (EI) mass spectra were recorded on a magnetic-sector machine.
Melting points were measured on an Optimelt automated melting point
system and are uncorrected. Analytical thin layer chromatography was
performed on aluminum-backed 0.2 mm thick silica gel 60 F254 plates as supplied by Merck. Eluted plates were visualized using
a 254 nm UV lamp and/or by treatment with a suitable dip followed
by heating. These dips included phosphomolybdic acid/ceric sulfate/sulfuric
acid (conc.)/water (37.5 g:7.5 g:37.5 g:720 mL) or potassium permanganate/potassium
carbonate/5% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution/water (3 g:20 g:5 mL:300
mL). Flash chromatographic separations were carried out following
protocols defined by Still et al.19 with
silica gel 60 (40–63 μm) as the stationary phase and
using the AR- or HPLC-grade solvents indicated. The melting points
of solids purified by such means were recorded directly (i.e., after
they had crystallized from the concentrated chromatographic fractions).
Starting materials and reagents were generally available from the
Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, TCI, Strem, or Lancaster Chemical Companies
and were used as supplied. Drying agents and other inorganic salts
were purchased from the AJAX, BDH, or Unilab Chemical Companies. Tetrahydrofuran
(THF), methanol, and dichloromethane were dried using a Glass Contour
solvent purification system that is based upon a technology originally
described by Grubbs et al.20 Where necessary,
reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Step i: Using a procedure
analogous to that described by Bazin et al.,21 a magnetically stirred solution of ferulic acid (3)
(30.2 g, 155.5 mmol) in dry methanol (200 mL) was treated with five
drops of concentrated sulfuric acid, and the resulting mixture was
heated under reflux for 24 h. The solution was then cooled to room
temperature, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The
residue thus obtained was dissolved in dichloromethane, and the resulting
solution was washed with NaHCO3 (2 × 100 mL of a saturated
aqueous solution) before being dried (MgSO4), filtered,
and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a pale-yellow oil.
Subjection of this oil to flash chromatography [silica, petroleum
ether → 1:5 v/v ethyl acetate/petroleum ether gradient elution]
and concentration of the relevant fractions (Rf = 0.6 in 1:1 v/v ethyl acetate/petroleum ether) under reduced
pressure afforded ferulic acid methyl ester22 (30.0 g, 93%) as a white, crystalline solid, mp = 60.9–62.1
°C (lit.22 mp = 65 °C). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.62 (d, J = 15.9 Hz, 1H), 7.07 (dd, J = 8.2 and
1.9 Hz, 1H), 7.02 (d, J = 1.9 Hz, 1H), 6.92 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 1H), 6.29 (d, J = 15.9 Hz,
1H), 5.90 (m, 1H), 3.92 (s, 3H), 3.79 (s, 3H); 13C NMR
(100 MHz, CDCl3) δ 167.8, 148.1, 146.9, 145.1, 127.1,
123.2, 115.3, 114.9, 109.5, 56.1, 51.7. These spectral data matched
those reported by Li et al.22

Step ii: Chloromethyl methyl ether (MOM-Cl) (12.0 mL, 158.3
mmol) was added dropwise to a magnetically stirred solution of ferulic
acid methyl ester (22.0 g, 105.6 mmol) and Hünig’s base
(i-Pr2NEt) (27.6 mL, 158.3 mmol) in dry
dichloromethane (100 mL) maintained at 0 °C. The resulting mixture
was allowed to warm to 22 °C and stirred at this temperature
for 14 h whilst being maintained under nitrogen then quenched with
NH4Cl (50 mL of a saturated aqueous solution). The mixture
thus obtained was stirred at 22 °C for a further 1 h then treated
with NaHCO3 (100 mL of a saturated aqueous solution). The
separated aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 ×
100 mL) and the combined organic phases were washed with Na2CO3 (3 × 50 mL of a saturated aqueous solution) and
brine (3 × 50 mL) before being dried (MgSO4), filtered,
and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a yellow oil. This
oil was subjected to flash chromatography [silica, dichloromethane
→ 1:20 v/v Et2O/dichloromethane gradient elution],
and concentration of the relevant fractions (Rf = 0.8 in 1:9 v/v Et2O/dichloromethane) under reduced
pressure afforded methyl (E)-3-(3-methoxy-4-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl)acrylate23 (25.0 g, 94%) as a clear, light-yellow oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.63 (d, J = 16.0 Hz, 1H), 7.15 (d, J = 8.1 Hz,
1H), 7.07 (m, 2H), 6.33 (d, J = 16.0 Hz, 1H), 5.26
(s, 2H), 3.91 (s, 3H), 3.80 (s, 3H), 3.51 (s, 3H); 13C
NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ 167.7, 149.9, 148.6, 144.8,
128.8, 122.4, 116.2, 115.9, 110.4, 95.3, 56.5, 56.1, 51.8. These spectral
data matched those reported by Lui et al.23

Step iii: Aluminum trichloride (14.45 g,
109.2
mmol) was added to dry THF (160 mL), and the resulting suspension
was stirred at 0 °C under nitrogen for 0.25 h. LiAlH4 (150 mL of a 1 M solution in THF, 150 mmol) was then added dropwise
over 0.5 h, and the resulting suspension was stirred for a further
0.5 h at 0 °C. A solution of methyl (E)-3-(3-methoxy-4-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl)acrylate
(24.97 g, 99.0 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) was then added (dropwise over
0.5 h) to the reaction mixture that was then stirred at 0 °C
for 0.5 h before being allowed to warm to 22 °C and stirred for
an additional 1 h at this temperature. The reaction mixture was then
cooled to 0 °C, water (5.7 mL) was added dropwise (Caution: hydrogen
gas evolution), and stirring then continued for 0.25 h. After this
time, NaOH (5.7 mL of a 15% w/v aqueous solution) was added to the
reaction mixture, and stirring continued for an additional 0.25 h
before more water (17.1 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was warmed
to 22 °C, diluted with Et2O (10 mL), then dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford
a light-yellow oil. Subjection of this material to flash chromatography
(silica, petroleum ether → ethyl acetate gradient elution)
and concentration of the relevant fractions (Rf = 0.4 in 1:1 v/v ethyl acetate/petroleum ether) under reduced
pressure afforded (E)-3-(3-methoxy-4-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl)prop-2-en-1-ol24 (21.21 g, 96%) as a white, crystalline solid,

(S)-3-(2-(4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)acetyl)-4-isopropyl-5,5-diphenyloxazolidin-2-one
(15)
Oxalyl chloride (710 μL, 8.14 mmol)
was added dropwise over 0.08 h to a magnetically stirred solution
of carboxylic acid 14 (1.65 g, 7.40 mmol) and dimethylformamide
(DMF) (28 μL, 0.37 mmol) in dichloromethane (15 mL) maintained
at 0 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ensuing mixture was
allowed to warm to 22 °C and stirred until gas evolution ceased
(ca. 1 h). The dichloromethane was then removed by sparging the reaction
mixture with a stream of nitrogen followed by further concentration
of the reaction mixture under reduced pressure. The acid chloride
thus obtained was dissolved in dry THF (15 mL). In a separate flask, n-BuLi (4.52 mL of a 1.5 M solution in hexanes, 6.79 mmol)
was added dropwise over 0.25 h to a magnetically stirred solution
of (S)-4-isopropyl-5,5-diphenyloxazolidin-2-one (12)14b (1.74 g, 6.17 mmol) in dry
THF (150 mL) maintained at 0 °C. The resulting solution was stirred
at this temperature for 0.5 h then cooled to −78 °C. The
previously formed solution of the acid chloride in THF was then added
dropwise over 0.25 h, and stirring of the combined solutions continued
at −78 °C for 0.5 h. The cooling bath was then removed,
and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 22 °C and stirring
was continued for 3 h. After this time, the reaction mixture was cooled
to 0 °C and quenched with NH4Cl (30 mL of a saturated
aqueous solution) then acetic acid (5 mL). The ensuing mixture was
allowed to warm, over 0.25 h, to 22 °C then it was extracted
with ethyl acetate (3 × 30 mL). The combined organic phases were
washed with NaHCO3 (2 × 10 mL of a saturated aqueous
solution) and brine (2 × 20 mL) before being dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure.
The ensuing viscous, clear, and light-yellow oil was subjected to
flash column chromatography (silica, hexane → 1:4 v/v ethyl
acetate/hexane gradient elution), and concentration of the appropriate
fractions (Rf = 0.3 in 1:4 v/v ethyl acetate/hexane)
afforded amide 15 (2.79 g, 93%) as a white foam, [α]20D = −156 (c = 0.3, CHCl3). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.52–7.27

Step i: A magnetically
stirred solution of amide 15 (2.00 g, 4.12 mmol) in dry
dichloromethane (8 mL) maintained at 0 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere
was treated, dropwise over 0.08 h, with freshly prepared14b Bu2BOTf (1.07 mL, 1.35 g, 4.94 mmol).
The ensuing mixture was allowed to warm to 22 °C, stirred at
this temperature for 0.25 h, then freshly distilled Hünig’s
base (970 μL, 5.56 mmol) was added dropwise over 0.08 h. Stirring
was continued at 22 °C for another 0.5 h then the reaction mixture
was cooled to −78 °C before a solution of aldehyde 16(27) (1.35 g, 4.94 mmol) in dichloromethane
(4 mL) was added via syringe pump over 0.75 h. The ensuing mixture
was stirred at −78 °C for a further 1 h then warmed to
0 °C, stirred at this temperature for 4 h, then quenched with
phosphate buffer (15 mL of a 1 M aqueous solution at pH 7) before
being treated with methanol/30% aq. hydrogen peroxide (10 mL of a
1:1 v/v mixture) and allowed to warm to 22 °C over 1 h. The biphasic
mixture thus obtained was diluted with water (20 mL), and the separated
aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 10 mL).
The combined organic phases were washed with brine (1 × 10 mL)
then dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The ensuing thick oil was subjected to flash
column chromatography (silica, dichloromethane → 1:19 v/v Et2O/dichloromethane gradient elution), and concentration of
the appropriate fractions (Rf = 0.5 in

nitrogen at 22 °C. The resulting solution was cooled to 0 °C,
and lithium borohydride (123 mg, 5.65 mmol) was then added in portions
over 0.08 h. The ensuing mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 0.5
h then warmed to 22 °C and stirred at this temperature for 2
h before being quenched with NH4Cl (20 mL of a saturated

The following one-pot procedure for preparing

°C for 2 h then heated at 40 °C for 4 h. The cooled reaction
mixture was stirred at 22 °C for 16 h before being diluted with
ethyl acetate (30 mL) and washed with NH4Cl (3 × 10

(ent-19)
A magnetically stirred solution
of diol ent-17 (452 mg, 0.95 mmol) in
dichloromethane (6 mL) was cooled to −5 °C and treated
sequentially with imidazole (129 mg, 1.9 mmol) and TBDMS-Cl (155 mg,
1.00 mmol). The cooling bath was then removed, and the reaction mixture
was stirred at 22 °C for 16 h before being quenched with NH4Cl (10 mL of a saturated aqueous solution). The separated
aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 10 mL)
and the combined organic phases were then washed with brine (2 ×
10 mL) before being dried (Na2SO4), filtered,
and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the anticipated bis-TBDMS
ether (386 mg) as a light-yellow oil. This oil was dissolved in DMF
(1 mL), and the resulting solution was treated with Cs2CO3 (307 mg, 0.95 mmol) and water (100 μL) then
stirred at 22 °C for 24 h. After this time, another batch of
Cs2CO3 (200 mg, 0.62 mmol) was added, and stirring
continued for an additional 24 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted
with ethyl acetate (30 mL) before being washed with NH4Cl (3 × 10 mL of a saturated aqueous solution). The combined
aqueous washings were extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL),
and the combined organic phases were then washed with brine (2 ×
10 mL) before being dried (Na2SO4), filtered,
and concentrated under reduced pressure. The ensuing pale-yellow residue
was subjected to flash column chromatography (silica, 1:9 v/v Et2O/dichloromethane), and concentration of the appropriate fractions
(Rf = 0.2 in 1:19 v/v Et2O
/DCM) afforded phenol ent-19 (232 mg,
51% over two steps) as a clear, colorless oil, [α]20D = +98.8 (c = 0.7, CHCl3).
All other spectral data acquired on this material were identical with
those reported above for compound 19.

added to the reaction mixture, and stirring was continued at 0 °C
for 1 h. The resulting mixture was quenched with NH4Cl
(20 mL of an aqueous solution), and the separated aqueous layer was
extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 10 mL). The combined organic
phases were washed with brine (2 × 15 mL) before being dried
(Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced

overnight at 4 °C with Matrigel basement membrane matrix. The
plates were incubated at 37 °C, and the cells in each well were
photographed (under 40× magnification) 4 h after seeding. Microtubules
were counted using Image J software. Each treatment was performed
in triplicate, and four independent experiments were performed.
