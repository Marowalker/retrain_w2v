Unlike
the easy electroless deposition of other metals, the deposition
of aluminum can be challenging. This is because the standard reduction
potential of aluminum lies outside the electrochemical window (EW)
of water. Ionic liquids such as AlCl3-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride (EMIC) have been used because of their wide EW. Here, we
introduce a novel ionic liquid for electroless deposition of aluminum
by reacting AlCl3 and urea, with lithium aluminum hydride
(LAH) as a reducing agent. Additionally, we report the first successful
effort in coating carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as an example of nanostructures
with high surface area to volume ratio, with aluminum using electroless
deposition. The produced aluminum coating was found to be nanostructured,
uniformly covering the CNTs and in close contact with their surfaces.

Introduction
The deposition of aluminum has been the
subject of intense investigations
in the past decade. Aluminum is a light metal of outstanding electric
and thermal conductivities, which lead to many promising applications
including electronic circuits, semiconductor devices, memory devices,
compact disks, composite materials for structural applications, and
many more.1−5

To metallize nonconductive substrates, electroless plating
has
become a frequently adopted technique due to its simplicity, reproducibility,
and low cost. Metals such as nickel and copper were found to be easily
deposited using electroless plating in aqueous solutions.6−11 On the other hand, the electroless deposition of aluminum was found
to be unfeasible in aqueous solutions due to the narrow electrochemical
window of water and the nature of aluminum as a less noble metal.12−14 However, using room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), scientists
were able to successfully electrodeposit aluminum on different substrates.15−21 A commonly used method for the electroless deposition of aluminum
is based on AlCl3-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride
(AlCl3-EMIC) ionic liquid with either diisobutylaluminum
hydride (DIBAH) in toluene as a liquid reducing agent, or lithium
hydride (LiH) as a solid reducing agent.12−14,22 The AlCl3-EMIC ionic liquid provides Al2Cl7– ions, which are the main species for aluminum deposition when reduced
by the electrons associated with the reducing agent. Attempting to
use AlCl3-EMIC RTIL to apply aluminum coats on nanostructures
of very high surface area to volume ratios can be costly. Therefore,
for such cases, alternatives are highly desired.

The use of
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a reinforcement phase in
aluminum matrix composites suffers from several challenges, namely,
the poor wettability and the nonuniform dispersion of CNTs in the
aluminum matrix.2,5,23−26 Electroless deposition of intermediate layers such as nickel, copper,
and silver on CNTs was found to improve their dispersion and wettability
in molten aluminum.2,5,9,10,27−31 Although coating CNTs with aluminum prior to their introduction
in the aluminum matrix would avoid undesirable alloying effects that
can occur when other metals are used, only minor efforts were conducted
in this regard. Trials to coat CNTs with aluminum using normal electroplating
were done. However, it was concluded that this is only viable when
CNTs are used in the form of a thin film.23 On the other hand, coating loose powders of CNTs comprised of aggregates
of individual CNTs would only be possible by electroless deposition.
Nonetheless, there are no reported efforts in the literature addressing
this.

In the current letter, we report the use of aluminum chloride
(AlCl3)–urea ionic liquid as an alternative RTIL
for electroless
deposition of aluminum wherein lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is used
as a reducing agent. The reaction mechanisms involving the presence
of Al2Cl7– ions are discussed. We also report the first effort
in covering multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with aluminum through
an electroless deposition. Additionally, we conducted a simple time-saving
one-step catalyzation process on CNTs instead of the two-step method
usually followed for electroless plating.7,9,32,33 The aluminum-coated
CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy.

Experimental
Section
Figure 1 shows the
general scheme of electroless deposition of aluminum on CNTs. The
electroless deposition cannot take place on noncatalytic surfaces
and hence catalytic activation of CNTs was first conducted using colloidal
Pd–Sn nanoparticles. Because the nanoparticles are typically
deposited with a thin layer of stannous hydroxide Sn(OH)2 on their surfaces, an acceleration step followed to remove excess
stannous hydroxide and increase the surface activity. Finally, the
electroless plating of aluminum was performed, as will be explained
in the next paragraphs.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram showing the process of obtaining
aluminum-coated
CNTs through activation, acceleration, and electroless deposition.

For the present study, multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs) supplied
by Thomas Swan Corporation (average diameter of 10–12 nm and
lengths of tens of micrometers) were used. The CNT surfaces were activated
using a one-step approach inspired by the plating of plastics (POP)
industry.32 To prepare the activation solution,
62.5 mL of a commercial colloidal Pd–Sn concentrate (supplied
by MacDermid Enthone Corporation) was stirred in chlorinated DI water
prepared by mixing 137.5 mL of DI water and 50 mL of concentrated
hydrochloric acid (37%).CNTs (0.1 g) were immersed in the prepared
Pd–Sn activation solution; the mixture was sonicated for 3
min and then stir-agitated for an extra 7 min. The activated CNTs
were then filtered out by means of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)
filter membrane (0.22 μm) using a microfiltration kit. During
filtration, the DI water was continuously added to wash the activated
CNTs from traces of the Pd–Sn solution. The collected CNTs
were then dispersed in a 50 g/L commercial accelerator solution (supplied
by MacDermid Enthone Corporation) for 5 min. For 0.1 g of CNTs, 250 mL of the accelerator
solution was used. The CNTs with the accelerated Pd–Sn nanoparticles
were then washed with DI water, filtered out, collected on a glass
dish by means of tweezers, and dried in a vacuum furnace at 100 °C
in preparation for electroless plating.

For electroless plating
of aluminum, the AlCl3-urea
mixture, to be used as an ionic liquid, was prepared under a dry argon
environment using the following steps. First, AlCl3 (99.999%,
Alfa Aesar) and urea (99.9%, Loba Chemie) were mixed in a 2:1 molar
ratio by magnetic stirring for 5 min. Since the reaction between AlCl3 and urea is exothermic, caution was exercised because excess
heat could result in the decomposition of the entire electrolyte.
Accordingly, the ionic liquid was prepared in four parts of 50 mL
each. In addition, the reaction flask was cooled on a sealed rubber
ice bucket to preserve the dry environment during the reaction and
thus avoid the decomposition of the electrolyte. By following the
previous steps, a transparent pale yellow ionic liquid was obtained.
As a final step, lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) (97%, Alfa Aesar)
was dissolved in diethyl ether and mixed with the prepared AlCl3–urea ionic liquid such that the final concentration
of LAH in the plating electrolyte was 2.5 g/L. The previously activated
CNTs were then immersed in the plating electrolyte under sonication
for 5 min and magnetic stir agitation for 10 extra min. In the current
work, 200 mL of the ionic liquid was used for each 0.1 g of CNTs.
To reduce the viscosity of the mixture for ease of filtration, more
diethyl ether was added, followed by filtration. After filtration,
the CNTs were washed thoroughly with diethyl ether on the same filter
membrane, dried overnight in a vacuum at 100 °C, and kept in
a sealed glass container under dry argon.

The procedure of electroless
plating of aluminum described above
is summarized in Figure 2. The morphology of the obtained aluminum coating was investigated
using SEM imaging (LEO SUPRA 55 FESEM equipped with Oxford EDS detector)
and TEM imaging (JEM-2100 LaB6, JEOL, operating at 200 kV and equipped
with Gatan SC200B CCD camera). The chemical composition of the Al-coated
CNTs was determined by means of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) analysis. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Cu Kα, Panalytical
Xpert Pro diffractometer) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED,
conducted in JEM-2100) were used to analyze the crystal structure
of the aluminum coat. Raman analysis (ProRaman-L, ENWAVE OPTRONICS)
was used to compare the intensities of the D-band and G-band (ID/IG) of CNTs before
and after electroless plating of aluminum to confirm their structural
integrity.

deposition of aluminum on CNTs.

Results
and Discussion
EDX analysis confirmed that 84.67% of aluminum
and 1.67% of carbon
are present in the prepared sample. In addition, the results showed
that some parts of the sample are oxidized, with oxygen present in
13.67%.

SEM imaging (Figure 3a) and high-resolution TEM imaging (Figure 3b) confirmed that there is
a considerable
increase in the diameter of CNTs as a result of the aluminum coat.
Aluminum-coated CNTs with diameters of about 100–150 nm were
obtained. The aluminum coating on CNTs was found to be nanostructured,
as shown in Figure 3c. It is believed that due to the refined structure of the catalytic
Pd–Sn nanoparticles used in the activation step, the aluminum
coating was deposited in a nanostructured manner. Further analysis
to confirm the average crystallite size of the deposited aluminum
was conducted using the XRD patterns collected from the sample, as
explained later.

indicating
a significant increase in the diameter of CNTs after being coated
with aluminum. (b) TEM image shows the Al-coated and uncoated part
of a CNT. (c) TEM image showing that the aluminum coat is nanostructured.
(d) Magnified view of a CNT showing a significant difference in the
diameter between the coated and uncoated parts of CNT.

The difference in the thickness between the coated and uncoated
parts of a CNT can be clearly seen in Figure 3d. The aluminum coat is noticeably much thicker
than the CNT itself, which is desirable when used in a composite material.
In this case, the provided aluminum coat would contribute to the overall
fraction of the aluminum matrix in the final composite.

Figure 4a shows
the XRD pattern of the obtained Al-coated CNTs, which confirms the
existence of the aluminum coat in a crystalline form. The pattern
shows the characteristic peaks for Al corresponding to the (111),
(200), (220), (311), and (222) planes in the face-centered cubic (FCC)
crystal structure. Interestingly, the 0002 peak of CNTs at 26°
was not detected in spite of the high concentration of CNTs in the
sample. This can be attributed to the CNTs being embedded inside the
aluminum coat. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) height for each
of the characteristic peaks was measured from the collected pattern
and average crystallite size of 31.7 nm was calculated using the Scherrer
equation, thus confirming the nanosized structure of the Al coat.

data of Al-coated CNTs by (a) XRD analysis. (b) SAED
indexing of aluminum superimposed on palladium and CNTs.

Additionally, using SAED indexing shown in Figure 4b, information about CNTs,
palladium, and
aluminum was revealed where the aluminum pattern was superimposed
on the patterns of both palladium and CNTs, indicating the presence
of palladium as well as CNTs underneath the aluminum coat. Palladium
was previously used to render the surface of CNTs catalytic prior
to plating.

Raman analysis results, shown in Figure 5, confirmed that the difference
in the ID/IG ratios between
the Al-coated CNTs and the as-received CNTs is not significant. This
can imply that the CNTs did not undergo any change in their structure
during electroless plating. However, a slight shift toward high wavenumbers
was noticed in the position of the G-band for the Al-coated CNTs compared
to the as-received ones, which can be attributed to the interaction
between CNTs, Pd–Sn nanoparticles, and aluminum after the coat
is applied.34

Figure 5 Raman analysis of Al-coated
CNTs compared with that of the as-received
CNTs.

The AlCl3–urea
ionic liquid, utilized in the
current study, was adapted from a battery electrolyte formed by reacting
AlCl3 and urea at molar ratios above 1:1.35,36 It was discovered that during the operation of the battery, aluminum
was deposited on the anode by the reduction of [AlCl2·(urea)n]+ shown in eq 1 and Al2Cl7– ions shown in eq 2.36 1   2  The
addition of extra AlCl3 was
found to enrich the ionic liquid with more Al2Cl7– ions, thus
promoting the conversion of AlCl4– into more Al2Cl7– ions as
shown in eq 3.36 3  In the current study, the
ionic liquid was
tailored for the current application by increasing the molar ratio
between AlCl3 and urea to 2:1 to promote the generation
of more Al2Cl7– ions and adding lithium aluminum hydride as a reducing
agent to promote the autocatalytic reduction process of Al2Cl7– ions and [AlCl2·(urea)n]+ without using an external power source.

Based
on the previous chemical reactions, aluminum was plated on
the CNTs from three different sources represented by the reduction
reaction of Al2Cl7– ions, the reduction reaction of [AlCl2·(urea)n]+, and
the decomposition of LAH.

Conclusions
The motivation of the
current study was to explore alternative
electrolytes for the electroless deposition of aluminum that are cheap
and can be prepared in large quantities for coating high surface area
to volume structures such as CNTs. The results confirm that the AlCl3–urea electrolyte is effective in covering the CNTs
uniformly with aluminum. In addition, the presented approach could
cut at least two undesirable processing steps, which were previously
thought to be essential in obtaining aluminum-coated CNTs. The first
is the acid functionalization of CNTs, which was found to be unnecessary.
The second is the use of a one-step colloidal Pd–Sn catalyzation
approach instead of the two-step stannous chloride and palladium chloride
solutions approach for surface activation.5,13,14,32,37 Accordingly, the processing time was reduced significantly.

The aluminum coat was found to be conformal according to the SEM
and TEM analysis. In addition, the aluminum was found to be nanostructured,
confirming that the colloidal palladium nanoparticles used in the
activation step were effective in the nucleation and film growth of
a nanostructured aluminum coat on the CNTs.

The process of electroless
plating of aluminum on CNTs presented
here could facilitate the use of Al-coated CNTs as a filler in aluminum
matrix composites. The high energy ball milling process, which is
widely used for dispersing CNTs in aluminum matrices prior to processing
by other techniques but is also reported to damage the CNTs and to
strain-harden the aluminum matrix, can thus be eliminated. With the
present approach, the CNTs were preserved in their original form without
damage in a way that makes them more effective in CNT-reinforced aluminum
composites. The investigation of the mechanical behavior of Al composites
reinforced with Al-coated CNTs is currently underway. Those high-performance
Al-CNT composites can be potentially used in structural applications
for aerospace and the automotive industries. Other potential applications
for the developed electroless plating of aluminum include aluminum
thin film deposition on conductive and nonconductive substrates and
microdevices, especially temperature-sensitive ones as well as corrosion-resistant
protective coats on steel parts. Finally, it is believed that the
process can be a good alternative for aluminum physical vapor deposition
(PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) thin film deposition.
