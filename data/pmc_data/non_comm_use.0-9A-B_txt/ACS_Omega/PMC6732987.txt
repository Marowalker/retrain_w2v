Reliable prediction
of the properties of nanosystems with radical
nature has been tremendously challenging for common computational
approaches. Aiming to overcome this, we employ thermally-assisted-occupation
density functional theory (TAO-DFT) to investigate various electronic
properties (e.g., singlet–triplet energy gaps, vertical ionization
potentials, vertical electron affinities, fundamental gaps, symmetrized
von Neumann entropy, active orbital occupation numbers, and visualization
of active orbitals) associated with a series of triangle-shaped graphene
nanoflakes with n fused benzene rings at each side
(denoted as n-triangulenes), which can be extended
from triangulene. According to our TAO-DFT results, the ground states
of n-triangulenes are singlets for all the values
of n studied (n = 3, 5, 7, 9, ...,
and 21). Moreover, the larger the values of n, the
more significant the polyradical nature of n-triangulenes.
There are approximately (n – 1) unpaired electrons
for the ground state of n-triangulene. The increasing
polyradical nature of the larger n-triangulenes should
be closely related to the fact that the active orbitals tend to be
mainly concentrated at the periphery of n-triangulenes,
apparently increasing with the molecular size.

1 Introduction
Because
of its promising properties and potential applications,
graphene has been extensively studied by several researchers in recent
years.1−6 For instance, the high carrier mobility, saturation velocity, and
long spin diffusion length of graphene have yielded the possibility
of developing fascinating electronics and spintronics based on graphene.1,2,6 Nonetheless, owing to the lack
of an energy band gap, graphene is not suitable for transistor applications.
A method to create a finite band gap in graphene is to cut it into
graphene nanoflakes.7−9 However, the properties of graphene nanoflakes can
be highly influenced by their shapes, sizes, and periphery conditions.10,11 Consequently, it is essentially important to investigate how these
factors affect the properties of graphene nanoflakes to fully utilize
the promising potential of graphene in electronics and spintronics.

Among graphene nanoflakes with several possible shapes, graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs), which are narrow strips of graphene, have attracted
considerable attention from the research community and have been regarded
as fascinating quasi-one-dimensional materials for electronic nanodevices.7−9,12−24 Owing to their low dimensionality and quantum size effect, GNRs
can possess energy band gaps for transistor operation with excellent
switching speed and high carrier mobility. In particular, zigzag GNRs
are anticipated to possess edge-localized states, which could be important
ingredients for electronics and spintronics based on GNRs.

On
the other hand, other shapes of graphene nanoflakes may deserve
our investigation as well. Very recently, the on-surface synthesis
of triangulene (a molecule with two unpaired electrons) has been successfully
achieved by Pavliček et al. using a needle-like scanning tunneling
microscopy tip (i.e., an unconventional synthesis).25 Besides, they found that triangulene did not bond to the
underlying metal surface, which was highly unexpected. Note, however,
that the microscopy tip used was not magnetic, and hence unable to
directly identify the spin polarization of the ground state of triangulene.26 Nonetheless, it can be anticipated that triangle-shaped
graphene nanoflakes, which can be extended from triangulene, may be
created using this new type of chemical synthesis in the near future.
Consequently, in this study, we focus on a series of triangle-shaped
graphene nanoflakes with n fused benzene rings at
each side (denoted as n-triangulenes), as illustrated
in Figure 1. Note that n-triangulenes (Cn2+4n+1H3n+3), which belong
to the category of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are delocalized
π-conjugated systems. A systematic study of the properties of n-triangulenes is crucially important to fully understand
their potential applications.

Figure 1 Geometry of n-triangulene,
consisting of n fused benzene rings at each side.

To date, the properties of n-triangulenes
have
been investigated mainly via computational approaches.27−34 However, Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT)35 with commonly used (e.g., the local density
approximation (LDA), generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), hybrid,
and double-hybrid) exchange–correlation (XC) density functionals
cannot adequately describe the ground-state properties of systems
with radical nature,36−38 such as n-triangulenes (as will
be shown and discussed later). On the other hand, it is common to
carry out ab initio multireference electronic structure calculations13,16,39−41 for an accurate
prediction of the ground-state properties of systems with radical
nature. Nonetheless, as the system size (n) grows,
the number of electrons in n-triangulene, N = 6n2 + 27n + 9, can quickly increase. Therefore, it is computationally intractable
to carry out sufficiently accurate multireference electronic structure
calculations for n-triangulenes, especially for those
with the larger n values. Accordingly, it remains
tremendously challenging for common computation approaches to reliably
describe the ground-state properties of the larger n-triangulenes.

With the aim to study the ground-state properties
of nanosystems
with radical nature at low computational cost with reasonable accuracy,
we have recently developed thermally-assisted-occupation density functional
theory (TAO-DFT),15 a density functional
theory with fractional orbital occupations produced by the Fermi–Dirac
distribution function. In TAO-DFT, the entropy contribution (e.g.,
see eq 26 of ref (15)), which are explicitly dependent on the fictitious temperature (θ)
and orbital occupation numbers, can approximately describe the static
correlation energy of a system (e.g., see Section III.E of ref (15) for the physical arguments
and Section IV of ref (15) for the numerical investigations), even when the simplest LDA XC
density functional is adopted. More sophisticated XC density functionals,
such as the GGA,19 global hybrid,24 and range-separated hybrid24,42 XC density functionals, can be adopted in TAO-DFT as well. Besides,
an approach that determines the fictitious temperature in TAO-DFT
in a self-consistent manner43 has been
recently developed to improve the overall accuracy of TAO-DFT for
general applications. As TAO-DFT is computationally efficient (i.e.,
similar to KS-DFT), we have employed TAO-DFT for the study of the
electronic properties of various nanosystems with radical nature in
recent years.20,22,44−49 Very recently, TAO-DFT and related approaches have also been employed
for the study of the properties of several nanosystems of radical
nature (e.g., cyclic nanorings and carbon nanotubes) by other researchers.50,51

Despite attracting great interest recently, graphene nanoflakes
with pronounced radical nature can be wrongly treated with standard
electronic structure methods (e.g., KS-DFT with commonly used XC density
functionals); hence, more investigations and new conceptions are really
needed at the nanoscale. Owing to an excellent trade-off between computational
cost and accuracy, employing TAO-DFT for a comprehensive study on
graphene nanoflakes with different shapes, edges, and sizes is well-justified.
Consequently, in this work, TAO-DFT is adopted for the study of various
electronic properties associated with n-triangulenes
(n = 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., and 21).

2 Computational
Details
All calculations are carried out with Q-Chem 4.0,52 using the 6-31G(d) basis set and the numerical
grid consisting
of 75 radial points in the Euler–Maclaurin quadrature and 302
angular points in the Lebedev grid. Results are computed using TAO-LDA15 (i.e., TAO-DFT with the LDA XC functional53,54 and the LDA θ-dependent functional (e.g., see eq 41 of ref (15))) with the fictitious
temperature θ = 7 mhartree (e.g., see Section V of ref (15) for this choice of θ).
For comparison, some results are also obtained with KS-LDA (i.e.,
KS-DFT with the LDA XC functional53,54). As KS-LDA
is simply TAO-LDA with θ = 0, the performance of KS-LDA is shown
here to assess the significance of TAO-LDA.

Although the XC
density functionals at the upper rungs of Jacob’s
ladder, such as the GGA19 and global hybrid24 XC density functionals, can also be adopted
in TAO-DFT, they improve upon TAO-LDA mainly for the properties governed
by short-range XC effects (e.g., the atomization energies and barrier
heights of systems with nonradical character) not for the properties
governed by strong static correlation effects (e.g., the singlet–triplet
energy gaps and fundamental gaps of systems with radical character).15,19,24 As shown in our previous studies, the GGA and global
hybrid XC density functionals in TAO-DFT have similar performance
as TAO-LDA for the electronic properties of linear acenes (i.e., systems
with polyradical character).15,19,24 Accordingly, the electronic properties of n-triangulenes
obtained with TAO-LDA are expected to be qualitatively similar to
those obtained with the GGA and global hybrid XC density functionals
in TAO-DFT.

It is worth mentioning that if the fundamental gap
is estimated
by the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) gap (i.e., the energy gap between the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO)) in KS-DFT, the LDA XC functional tends to underestimate
the fundamental gap due to the lack of the derivative discontinuity
(DD) of the LDA XC functional.55 Therefore,
in this work, the fundamental gap is obtained with multiple energy-difference
calculations (see eqs 2–4), circumventing the above DD issue
and showing a reasonably good accuracy for a wide variety of atoms
and molecules (see, e.g., Table 5 of ref (56)). For TAO-LDA, the fundamental gap cannot be
directly estimated by the HOMO–LUMO gap due to the possibility
of fractional orbital occupations (see, e.g., Section III of ref (43)); hence, the fundamental
gap is obtained with the aforementioned multiple energy-difference
calculations.19

Besides, the expectation
value of the total spin-squared operator,
⟨Ŝ2⟩, is computed
for the assessment of the degree of spin contamination in KS-DFT.
For a system with significant radical nature, the ⟨Ŝ2⟩ value calculated using commonly
used XC functionals in KS-DFT can differ considerably (e.g., 10% difference
or more) from the exact value S(S + 1),57 where S can
be 0 (singlet), 1/2 (doublet), 1 (triplet), 3/2 (quartet), 2 (quintet),
and so forth. For such a system, the results obtained with the commonly
used XC functionals in KS-DFT can be unreliable due to spin contamination
(i.e., the artificial mixing of different electronic spin states).15,19,20,44,48,49,58−60

Similar to the case of
spin-unrestricted Hartree–Fock (HF)
theory, the expectation value of the total spin-squared operator of
spin-unrestricted KS-DFT is evaluated with the Kohn–Sham (KS)
wavefunction (i.e., a single Slater determinant constructed from a
set of KS orbitals) associated with the ground-state density (e.g.,
see eq 3 in the Supporting Information (SI) of ref (21)). However, in TAO-DFT,15 the ground-state density of a physical system
at zero (physical) temperature is represented by the thermal equilibrium
density of a noninteracting system at the fictitious temperature θ;
hence, the wavefunction associated with this ground-state density
remains unknown. Therefore, the expectation value of the total spin-squared
operator of spin-unrestricted TAO-DFT remains undefined due to the
lack of wavefunction information. Therefore, we also investigate the
consequences of spin contamination by comparing the difference between
the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted energies for the lowest
singlet state of n-triangulene, which should be zero
for the exact theory due to the symmetry constraint.15,17,19,20,44,48,49

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Singlet–Triplet Energy Gap
To obtain the ground
state (i.e., the energetically preferred spin
state) of n-triangulene (n = 3,
5, 7, 9, ..., and 21), calculations based on spin-unrestricted TAO-LDA
and KS-LDA are carried out to determine the lowest singlet and lowest
triplet states of n-triangulene, with the respective
geometries being fully optimized. Afterward, the singlet–triplet
energy gap of n-triangulene is calculated as 1  where ES and ET are the energies of the lowest singlet and
lowest triplet states, respectively, of n-triangulene.
Owing to severe spin contamination (see the discussion below), it
is extremely difficult to obtain the converged KS-LDA results for
the larger n-triangulenes (e.g., n > 9). Therefore, the KS-LDA results are only reported for the
smaller n-triangulenes (e.g., up to n = 9) due
to convergence problems.

Figure 2 plots the EST value of n-triangulene as a function of the side length, computed
using spin-unrestricted TAO-LDA and KS-LDA. Based on TAO-LDA, EST decreases monotonically with the increase
of n, and n-triangulenes possess
singlet ground states for all the values of n studied
(n = 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., and 21). By contrast, from
the KS-LDA results, the triplet states of n-triangulenes
(e.g., n = 3, 5, 7, and 9) have lower energies than
the corresponding singlet states (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information (SI) for detailed numerical results).

Figure 2 Singlet–triplet
energy gap of n-triangulene
computed using spin-unrestricted TAO-LDA and KS-LDA.

Here, we investigate the reasons of discrepancies by computing
the ⟨Ŝ2⟩ values for
the lowest singlet and lowest triplet states of n-triangulene using spin-unrestricted KS-LDA. On the basis of the
computed ⟨Ŝ2⟩ values
(see Table 1), the
lowest singlet and lowest triplet states of n-triangulene,
computed using spin-unrestricted KS-LDA, are strongly influenced by
spin contamination, with the sole exception of the lowest triplet
state of 3-triangulene. Moreover, the degree of spin contamination
in the lowest singlet and lowest triplet states of n-triangulene rapidly increases with increasing n, implying that the larger n-triangulenes may have
an increasing polyradical nature in the lowest singlet and lowest
triplet states. Therefore, the contradictory results obtained with
KS-LDA should be artifacts associated with spin contamination.15,19,20,44,48,49,58−60 It should be mentioned that the
errors caused by spin contamination are not systematic errors, which
can adversely affect the difference in energy between the spin-states
of n-triangulene (e.g., EST).

a Note that the exact
value S(S + 1) is 0 for the singlet
state and
2 for the triplet state.

On the other hand, owing to the symmetry constraint,15,17,19,20,44,48,49 for the lowest singlet state of n-triangulene, the spin-restricted energy obtained with the exact
theory should be identical to the respective spin-unrestricted energy.
Nevertheless, KS-DFT with commonly used XC functionals can fail to
fulfill this condition due to the aforementioned spin contamination.
Here, we examine if the symmetry-breaking effects occur by additionally
performing spin-restricted TAO-LDA and KS-LDA calculations for the
lowest singlet states of n-triangulenes, with the
respective geometries being fully optimized. Because of the spin contamination
issue mentioned above, the difference between the spin-restricted
and spin-unrestricted energies, obtained with KS-LDA, for the lowest
singlet state of n-triangulene is considerably large
(e.g., the energy difference is 10.78 kcal/mol for n = 3, 8.70 kcal/mol for n = 5, and 12.26 kcal/mol
for n = 7) when compared with the magnitude of the
corresponding EST value, obtained with
spin-unrestricted KS-LDA (e.g., see Figure 2). By contrast, the spin-restricted energy
obtained with TAO-LDA is essentially the same as the respective spin-unrestricted
energy (i.e., within the numerical precision considered in the present
work) for the lowest singlet state of n-triangulene,
indicating that unphysical symmetry-breaking solutions are not generated
by our spin-unrestricted TAO-LDA calculations.

3.2 Vertical
Ionization Potential, Vertical Electron
Affinity, and Fundamental Gap
Here, we examine whether n-triangulenes are promising for photovoltaic applications.
Calculations based on spin-unrestricted TAO-LDA are carried out at
the ground-state (i.e., the lowest singlet state) geometry of n-triangulene to obtain the vertical ionization potential 2  vertical
electron affinity 3  and fundamental gap 4  where E(X), E(X+), and E(X–) are
the total energies of n-triangulene in the neutral,
cationic, and anionic states, respectively.

As presented in Figure 3, 4, 5, with the increase of system size,
IPv decreases monotonically, EAv increases monotonically,
and thus, Eg decreases monotonically.
It is worth mentioning that the Eg values
of n-triangulenes (n = 5, 7, 9,
..., and 19) range from 1 to 3 eV, lying in the ideal regime for photovoltaic
applications (see Table S2 in the SI for
detailed numerical results).

state of n-triangulene computed using spin-unrestricted
TAO-LDA.

of n-triangulene computed using spin-unrestricted
TAO-LDA.

3.3 Symmetrized von Neumann Entropy
To
assess the radical nature of the ground state of n-triangulene, we compute the symmetrized von Neumann entropy17,19,20,44,49 5  using spin-unrestricted TAO-LDA. Here, fi,σ (i.e., a value between
zero and one) is the ith σ-spin (σ =
α or β) orbital occupation number obtained with spin-unrestricted
TAO-LDA, approximately yielding the ith σ-spin
natural orbital occupation number.15,19,22,24 For a system of nonradical
nature, {fi,σ}
take values in the vicinity of zero or one; hence, the corresponding SvN is very small. However, for a system with
significant radical nature, {fi,σ} can differ greatly from either zero or one for active
spin orbitals (i.e., the spin orbitals that are fractionally occupied)
and take the values in the vicinity of zero or one for other spin
orbitals; hence, the corresponding SvN can grow rapidly with the number of spin orbitals that are fractionally
occupied.

As shown in Figure 6, SvN grows monotonically
with increasing n. Therefore, the larger n-triangulenes are expected to possess increasing polyradical
nature in their ground states (see Table S2 in SI for detailed numerical results).

Figure 6 Symmetrized von Neumann
entropy for the ground state of n-triangulene computed
using spin-unrestricted TAO-LDA.

3.4 Active Orbital Occupation Numbers
To understand
why SvN grows rapidly with n, we plot the occupation numbers of active orbitals for
the ground state of n-triangulene, computed using
spin-restricted TAO-LDA. For the ground state of n-triangulene, the (N/2)th orbital is referred to
as the HOMO, the (N/2 + 1)th orbital is referred
to as the LUMO, and so forth, with N being the number
of electrons in n-triangulene.15,20,22,44,49

As presented in Figure 7, with the increase of the side length of n-triangulene, there are growing number of orbitals with
occupation number in the vicinity of one (i.e., there are growing
number of spin orbitals with occupation number in the vicinity of
0.5). Interestingly, the occupation numbers of active orbitals are
found to be very close to one (e.g., between 0.9 and 1.1), indicating
that the radical nature of n-triangulenes should
be very significant. On the basis of our TAO-LDA results, 3-triangulene
exhibits a pronounced diradical nature (e.g., the active orbitals
are HOMO and LUMO), 5-triangulene exhibits a pronounced tetraradical
nature (e.g., the active orbitals are HOMO – 1, HOMO, LUMO,
and LUMO + 1), 7-triangulene exhibits a pronounced hexaradical nature
(e.g., the active orbitals are HOMO – 2, HOMO – 1, HOMO,
LUMO, LUMO + 1, and LUMO + 2), 9-triangulene exhibits a pronounced
octaradical nature (e.g., the active orbitals are HOMO – 3,
HOMO – 2, HOMO – 1, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO + 1, LUMO + 2,
and LUMO + 3), and so forth. In other words, there are approximately
(n – 1) unpaired electrons for the ground
state of n-triangulene.22,33 Accordingly, the larger n-triangulenes should indeed
exhibit increasing polyradical nature in their ground states.

Figure 7 Occupation
numbers of active orbitals for the ground state of n-triangulene computed using spin-restricted TAO-LDA. Here,
for simplicity, HOMO and LUMO are referred to as H and L, respectively.

Similar to our previous TAO-DFT studies on hexagon-shaped
graphene
nanoflakes48 and zigzag GNRs,20 the larger n-triangulenes also
possess a polyradical nature in their ground states. However, the
electronic properties of n-triangulenes, hexagon-shaped
graphene nanoflakes, and zigzag GNRs are distinctly different. For
example, n-triangulenes possess a very significant
polyradical nature (e.g., the occupation numbers of active spin orbitals
are all very close to 0.5), yielding approximately (n – 1) unpaired electrons in their ground states. By contrast,
with increasing system size, there is a monotonic transition from
the nonradical nature of the smaller hexagon-shaped graphene nanoflakes
to the increasing polyradical nature of the larger hexagon-shaped
graphene nanoflakes (see Figures 5–9 of ref (48)). Besides, the zigzag
GNRs exhibit an oscillatory polyradical nature with increasing ribbon
length, and the polyradical nature is also highly dependent on the
ribbon width (see Figures 11–13 of ref (20)). On the other hand, the
narrowest armchair GNRs (i.e., a series of planar poly(p-phenylene) oligomers) possess a nonradical nature in their ground
states,21 regardless of the ribbon length.
These examples clearly support the statement that the radical nature
of graphene nanoflakes (e.g., triangle-shaped graphene nanoflakes
(n-triangulenes), hexagon-shaped graphene nanoflakes,
zigzag GNRs, and armchair GNRs) is intimately correlated with the
shapes, edges, and sizes of graphene nanoflakes. Accordingly, it is
essential to conduct a comprehensive study on graphene nanoflakes
of different shapes, edges, and sizes for guiding the modulation of
electronic and magnetic properties.

3.5 Visualization
of Active Orbitals
For the ground states of some representative n-triangulenes
(e.g., n = 3, 5, 7, and 9), we explore the visualization
of active orbitals (i.e., the orbitals with an occupation number in
the vicinity of one), obtained with spin-restricted TAO-LDA. As presented
in Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, the highest two active orbitals (e.g., HOMO and LUMO for n = 3, LUMO and LUMO + 1 for n = 5, LUMO
+ 1 and LUMO + 2 for n = 7, LUMO + 2 and LUMO + 3
for n = 9, and so forth) are delocalized over the
entire n-triangulene molecule. Besides, the lower
the energies of active orbitals, the more concentrated at the periphery
of n-triangulene the active orbitals. This indicates
that these edge states, when available, are energetically more favorable
than others. For larger n-triangulenes, there are
more edge states available; hence, there are more unpaired electrons
near the edges of n-triangulenes. However, the reason
of this fact (i.e., that the active orbitals with lower energies (and
hence, with larger occupation numbers) have an increased tendency
to localize at the edges of n-triangulenes) may not
be obvious; hence, it will be interesting to build a simple model
to explain this fact in the near future.

active orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) for the ground
state of 3-triangulene computed using spin-restricted TAO-LDA at isovalue

referred to as H and L, respectively. The orbital occupation numbers
are shown in parentheses.

and L, respectively. The orbital occupation numbers are shown in parentheses.

HOMO –

TAO-LDA at isovalue = 0.02 e/Å3. Here, for simplicity,
HOMO and LUMO are referred to as H and L, respectively. The orbital
occupation numbers are shown in parentheses.

Similar to previous findings for zigzag GNRs,13,16,17,20 the increasing
polyradical nature of the larger n-triangulenes should
be closely related to the fact that active orbitals tend to be mainly
concentrated at the periphery of n-triangulenes,
apparently increasing with the molecular size.

4 Conclusions
We have investigated the electronic properties,
such as EST, IPv, EAv, Eg, SvN, active orbital
occupation numbers, and visualization of active orbitals, of n-triangulenes (n = 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., and
21) using TAO-DFT due to its decent balance between cost and performance
for studying nanosystems with radical nature. As the larger n-triangulenes exhibit an increasing polyradical nature
in their ground states, the properties of n-triangulenes
may not be reliably predicted by KS-DFT with the commonly used XC
functionals. On the other hand, it is computationally intractable
to study the properties of the larger n-triangulenes
using a sufficiently accurate multireference electronic structure
method. Accordingly, employing TAO-DFT to study the electronic properties
of n-triangulenes in this work is certainly justified.

According to our TAO-DFT results, n-triangulenes
have singlet ground states for all the values of n studied. Relative to the smaller n-triangulenes,
the larger n-triangulenes possess smaller EST values, smaller Eg values, larger SvN values, and more
significant polyradical nature. In particular, 3-triangulene exhibits
a pronounced diradical nature, 5-triangulene exhibits a pronounced
tetraradical nature, 7-triangulene exhibits a pronounced hexaradical
nature, 9-triangulene exhibits a pronounced octaradical nature, and
so forth. Accordingly, there are approximately (n – 1) unpaired electrons for the ground state of n-triangulene. The increasing polyradical nature of the larger n-triangulenes should be closely related to the fact that
the active orbitals tend to be mainly concentrated at the periphery
of n-triangulenes, apparently increasing with the
molecular size. On the other hand, in view of the approximate nature
of the method adopted in this work, to examine the accuracy of our
TAO-DFT results, the electronic properties of n-triangulenes
obtained with relatively inexpensive and reliably accurate ab initio
multireference electronic structure methods are called for.

Since the polyradical nature of n-triangulenes
(i.e., triangle-shaped graphene nanoflakes) is closely related to
the shapes, edges, and sizes of graphene nanoflakes, several possible
directions can be further explored to establish the structure–,
edge–, and size–property relationships guiding the modulation
of electronic and magnetic properties. For example, if two graphene
nanoflakes are covalently bonded together, it will be interesting
to examine if the polyradical nature remains or not. Besides, the
role of structural defects (e.g., atomic vacancies, pentagon–heptagon
defects, adatoms, and dopants) in graphene nanoflakes can be further
investigated. Moreover, to passivate the polyradical nature of graphene
nanoflakes, we may consider different edge types and chemical termination
of the edges in graphene nanoflakes. Furthermore, we may switch from
graphene nanoflakes to the corresponding nanoflakes with two or more
heteroatoms (e.g., boron nitride nanoflakes) to see if the polyradical
nature persists or not. We plan to address some of these questions
in the near future.
