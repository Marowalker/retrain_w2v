A well-behaved
model chemistry previously validated for the study
of the chemical reactivity of peptides was considered for the calculation
of the molecular properties and structures of a group of five new
antifungal tripeptides, namely (2R)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]propanamido]-5-[(diaminomethylidene)amino]pentanoic
acid, (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenyl propanamido]propanamido]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic
acid, (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-methylbutanamido]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic
acid, (2R)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamido]-3-sulfanylpropanoic
acid, and (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamido]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic
acid, according to their amino acid sequences. A methodology based
on conceptual density functional theory was chosen for the determination
of the reactivity descriptors. The molecular active sites were associated
with the active regions of the molecules that were associated with
the nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical Fukui functions. Additionally,
the pKa values for the different peptides
are predicted with great accuracy, which constitutes a useful knowledge
for the process of drug design. Finally, the bioactivity scores for
the new antifungal peptides are predicted through a homology methodology
relating them with the calculated reactivity descriptors.

==== Body
Introduction
It is well known nowadays that, within
medicinal chemistry research,
the design and development of new pharmaceutical drugs have a preponderant
place. These drugs act by producing changes in some physiological
process or function, exerting their effect by interacting specifically
with some macromolecular structure of an organism which is called
the receptor. In this way, the interaction of each drug with its respective
receptor or site of action initiates the biochemical and physiological
changes that are characteristic of that drug.1−3

Starting
from the knowledge of the receptor associated to each
disease, a protocol composed of a series of steps, generally known
as computer-aided drug design, has been devised by researchers in
this field over the past decades allowing us to understand the way
by which the potential drugs interact with the corresponding sites
of action, leading to the name of druggable receptors. Computers play
a significant role in this protocol and, together with their associated
software, have become an indispensable tool for performing these tasks
with a guarantee of success.1−3

There are actually two variants
of this protocol depending on whether
the molecular structure of the druggable receptor is or is not known.
When the structure of the receptor is already known, the following
process is called structure-based drug design and has a long-standing
record of already developed pharmaceutical drugs. However, when this
knowledge is not available, the process is called ligand-based drug
design, and it is associated with some computer-related techniques
like pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure activity relationship
(QSAR), and three-dimensional (3D)-QSAR.

QSAR is one of the
most important methodologies that can be used
in the process of drug design and development.4−6 Its utility
resides in the idea that the biological activity of a given molecule
candidate, to be considered as a potential drug, can be expressed
in the form of a mathematical formula relating this activity with
a series of parameters called descriptors. Although there are hundreds
of descriptors available from the specialized literature, for the
objectives of the present work, we will be more interested in those
properly called chemical reactivity descriptors which arise naturally
from the conceptual density functional theory (CDFT), which allow
to understand the interaction between molecules as well to have a
comprehensive picture on the way that chemical reactions proceed.7−9

The reasons for this election are based on the assumption
that
relates the potential bioactivity of drugs with their chemical reactivity
from the molecular point of view10,11 and also that
when a group of descriptors cannot be cast in a QSAR mathematical
formulation because of the limited availability of information, the
knowledge of the chemical reactivity of a small group of molecules
may still provide useful results that can serve as a guide for the
purpose of the research.

One of the most important groups of
molecules which have arisen
during the last years as potential candidates to be considered as
pharmaceutical drugs are that of peptides of marine origin. Although
there have been some controversies in the literature about the possibilities
of considering small peptides as drugs because of their limited bioavailability,
it is also true that there has been an explosion of research in this
field since the beginning of the 21st century because of the potential
importance that peptides may have in the practice of medicinal chemistry.12−14

Assuming that an understanding of the chemical interactions
is
essential for the development of new pharmaceutical drugs, several
recently synthesized small tripeptides have been chosen as the object
of this study by considering that they could be the basis for the
development of new therapeutic antifungal peptides.15 Thus, in this work, we will be studying the reactivity
properties of five new antifungal tripeptides, namely (2R)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]propanamido]-5-[(diaminomethylidene)amino]pentanoic
acid, (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenyl propanamido]propanamido]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic
acid, (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-methylbutanamido]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic
acid, (2R)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamido]-3-sulfanylpropanoic
acid, and (2S)-2-[(2S)-2-[(2S)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanamido]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamido]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pro-panoic
acid, by resorting to the CDFT methodology, which will allow the determination
of the global properties as well as the local properties for the prediction
of the active reaction sites, both electrophilic and nucleophilic.
The corresponding short names for these tripeptides are FAR, FAY,
FVY, FWC, and FWY. In a similar way, the pKa values for each of the tripeptides will be
calculated by resorting to a methodology previously considered by
us,16 and the descriptors of bioactivity
(bioactivity scores) will be established through a procedure described
in the literature,17,18 trying to relate them with the
global and local CDFT reactivity descriptors that result from a calculation
protocol based on DFT already validated by our group in previous research.19−26

Computational Methodology
Following the methodology considered
in our previous works,19−26 similar computations have been performed in this work by resorting
to the Gaussian 09 software.27 The full
methodological procedure is explained in detail at the beginning of
the Results and Discussion section. In a similar
way as it was done in the referenced works, the MN12SX density functional28 was considered because of the fact that it is
a well-behaved density functional for our purposes according to our
proposed KID (for Koopmans in DFT) criteria,19−26 related to the approximate validity of the Koopmans theorem within
DFT.29−33 For the calculation of the electronic properties, a model chemistry
has been considered on the basis of the MN12SX density functional
associated to the Def2TZVP basis set, whereas a smaller Def2SVP was
considered for the prediction of the most stable structures.34,35 All calculations were performed using water, which is the universal
biological solvent, simulated with the Solvent Model Density (SMD)
model.36

Results and Discussion
The molecular structures of the antifungal tripeptides FAR, FAY,
FVY, FWC, and FWY drawn by scratch, as depicted in Figure 1, were optimized in gas phase
by resorting to the Density Functional Tight Binding Model A (DFTBA)
model, through the consideration of the five most stable conformers
chosen from a preoptimization accomplished by means of molecular mechanics
techniques37−41 using the conformer search engine available in the Marvin View 17.15
program, which can be regarded as an advanced chemical viewer (https://www.chemaxon.com). All the resulting conformers were processed, as is customary within
computational chemistry, by means of a new reoptimization with the
MN12SX density functional mentioned before, together with the Def2SVP
basis set and the SMD solvent model, using water as the solvent. Once
it has been verified that every structure belonged to the minimum
energy conformation by means of a frequency calculation analysis,
the corresponding electronic properties were calculated with the Def2TZVP
basis set instead of that used for the geometry optimization.

tripeptides showing the numbering of the atoms: (a) FAR; (b) FAY;
(c) FVY; (d) FWC; and (e) FWY, where green is used for C, red for
O, blue for N, and gray for H.

As it has been mentioned recently by Becke42 and also by Baerends et al.,43 it can
be said that the lowest excitation energy can be associated with the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) gap of the ground state.44 Therefore, in this work, the determination of the maximum
wavelength absorption of the five antifungal tripeptides was done
by conducting ground-state calculations with the aforementioned density
functional at the same level of model chemistry and theory and then
determining the HOMO–LUMO gaps from which the maximum absorption
wavelengths λmax were obtained (Table 1).

Calculation of Global Reactivity Descriptors
According
to the results obtained when studying melanoidins19−25 as well as peptides from marine sources,26 it can be said that the calculations performed with the MN12SX density
functional render HOMO and LUMO energies that satisfy the approximate
Koopmans theorem. Thus, the application of the KID procedure will
be justified. The global reactivity descriptors, electronegativity
χ,7,9 global hardness η,7,9 electrophilicity
ω,45 electrodonating power ω–,46 electroaccepting power
ω+,46 and net
electrophilicity Δω±47 were calculated by resorting to the HOMO and LUMO energies
determined with the MN12SX density functional, with the results being
presented in Table 2. The interested reader in the mathematical formulations of these
reactivity descriptors is referred to the original works and to our
previous research on the field.19−26

Table 2 Global Reactivity Descriptors of the

FWC	5.563	1.880	7.442	
FWY	10.294	5.885	16.178	
As
expected from the molecular structure of these species, their
electrodonating ability is more important than their electroaccepting
character as can be seen from the values of the electrodonating and
electroaccepting powers and their comparison through the net electrophilicity.
However, an interesting comparison can be performed by taking into
account the values for the global hardness which is a measure of the
deformability of the molecular electron density and, hence, of the
chemical reactivity. In this case, it can be observed that FVY and
FWC are much more reactive than the other tripeptides. This is corroborated
by the lower values of the global electrophilicity, that is, the balance
between the chemical electronegativity and the global hardness, for
those peptides.

Local Reactivity Descriptor Calculation
We now turn
our attention to the local descriptors of chemical reactivity, namely
the electrophilic Fukui function f–(r),7−9 the nucleophilic Fukui function f+(r),7−9 and the dual descriptor (DD) Δf(r).48−52 As for the case of the global reactivity descriptors, the interested
reader in the mathematical formulations of these reactivity descriptors
is referred to the original works and to our previous research on
the field.19−26

The electrophilic Fukui functions f–(r) and nucleophilic Fukui functions f+(r) for the five new antifungal tripeptides
FAR, FAY, FVY, FWC, and FWY are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Graphical representation of the electrophilic
Fukui functions f–(r) (left column) and nucleophilic
Fukui functions f+(r) (right
column) of the five antifungal tripeptides.

Martínez-Araya has explained in a recent research52 that the condensed expression for DD as Δfk will be more useful for the
prediction of the preferred sites of reaction than the condensed Fukui
functions alone. For this reason, we have decided to present the results
for the condensed DD Δfk in comparison with the nucleophilic and electrophilic Parr
functions, Pk+ and Pk–, proposed by Domingo et al.53,54 through the consideration
of atomic spin densities that result from the Mulliken population
analysis (MPA).

The definitions for the Parr functions are as
follows:

Nucleophilic Parr function53,54  

Electrophilic Parr function53,54  where ρsrc(r) and ρsra(r) are related
to the atomic spin density of the radical cation or anion of the considered
system, respectively.55

The results
for the calculation of these local reactivity descriptors
for the five antifungal tripeptides FAR, FAY, FVY, FWC, and FWY are
presented in Table 3 where the condensed DD Δfk has been determined by localizing the corresponding Fukui
functions over the atomic sites, employing a charge scheme based on
MPA as it was done for the Parr functions. It must be noticed that
we are presenting the results only for those atomic sites where Δfk are maxima in absolute value.
The values of Δfk are multiplied by 100 for easier comparison.

FWY	
29C	–22.96	0.013	0.459	
41C	12.68	0.316	0.126	
As can be seen from Table 3, there is a good
agreement between the results that come
from the condensed DD Δfk and those obtained through the nucleophilic and electrophilic
Parr functions Pk+ and Pk–. Thus, it can be expected that the methodology used in this work
could be the basis for the study of the chemical reactivity of therapeutic
peptides of larger size. Moreover, by comparing the results from Table 3 and the graphics
in Figure 2, it can
be concluded that there is a perfect match for both kinds of analysis.

Calculation of the pKa’s
of the Five Antifungal Tripeptides
In a recent work, the
relationship between the pKa’s
of small peptides and the chemical hardness was developed in our group,16 leading to the conclusion that it represented
a starting point for the prediction of the pKa of bigger peptides which could be of interest for the development
of new therapeutic drugs.

According to the methodology employed
in our previous work, we have applied the mentioned relationship of
the form pKa = 16.3088 – 0.8268η
to the calculation of the pKa of the new
tripeptides, with the η values presented in Table 4.

Table 4 pKa’s
of the Antifungal Tripeptides FAR, FAY, FVY, FWC, and FWY
molecule	pKa	
FAR	12.83	
FAY	13.88	
FVY	12.59	
FWC	13.08	
FWY	11.44	
It is
good to see from these results that this approximate relationship
allows us to discriminate between the pKa results for the tripeptides. This could be of interest for the development
of pharmaceutical drugs starting from these molecules, enabling at
the same time to obtain an explanation about the mechanisms of action
and drug delivery procedures. Moreover, they can be shown as an additional
application of the results of the calculation of the global reactivity
descriptors to the new field of computational peptidology56 and as a possible basis for explaining the solubilities
of the peptides.

Bioactivity Scores
The properties
of the molecules
that are identified with the idea of their ability to behave as a
pharmaceutical drug are those which are related to the proposal by
Lipinski et al.57,58 for the prediction of druggability
and have been determined by associating the SMILES notations corresponding
to each tripeptide with the MolInspiration software which is readily
available online (Slovensky Grob, Slovak Republic https://www.molinspiration.com).

Indeed, this criterion which is called the Lipinski Rule
of Five, or Ro5 for short, does not apply to peptides. Then, a homology
modeling approach was considered by searching for structures with
known pharmacological properties that could be compared with those
that are the object of our study. Thus, a series of descriptors called
bioactivity scores which are an indication of the capacity of the
potential drugs to interact with different receptors, such as G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) ligands or kinase inhibitors, to act as ion channel
modulators, or to interact with enzymes and nuclear receptors. It
must be recalled that GPCRs are the largest family of signaling receptors
in the human genome and also are the largest class of targets of approved
drugs. The values of the bioactivity scores for the five antimicrobial
peptides are presented in Table 5.

Table 5 Bioactivity Scores of the Antimicrobial
Peptides FAR, FAY, FVY, FWC, and FWY Calculated on the Basis of the
GPCR Ligand, Ion Channel Modulator, Nuclear Receptor Ligand, Kinase
Inhibitor, Protease Inhibitor, and Enzyme Inhibitor Interactions
molecule	GPCR ligand	ion channel
modulator	kinase inhibitor	nuclear receptor
ligand	protease
inhibitor	enzyme inhibitor	
FAR	0.42	0.24	0.08	0.08	0.64	0.47	
FAY	0.35	0.18	0.10	0.17	0.67	0.38	
FVY	0.32	0.15	0.07	0.15	0.67	0.36	
FWC	0.43	0.29	0.09	0.07	1.09	0.51	
FWY	0.39	0.21	0.07	0.11	0.78	0.35	
The interpretation
of the bioactivity scores is based on a scheme
that tends to classify them as active, moderately active, or inactive,
depending on the obtained values. If the bioactivity score is >0,
it will correspond to the first case; if the bioactivity score lies
between −5.0 and 0.0, it will belong to the second case; and
if the bioactivity score is <−5.0, it will be assigned to
the third case. It can be seen that although the antifungal tripeptides
considered in this work may act as GPCR ligands and as ion channel
modulators, their main bioactivity is related to their ability to
act as protease inhibitors. It is also evident that for the FWC peptide,
this ability is larger than for the other tripeptides. Although this
behavior cannot be cast into a QSAR equation because the number of
results is low, it can be however related to the values of the global
descriptors for this particular tripeptide. From Table 2, it can be seen that for FWC,
the values of the electronegativity χ, the electrophilicity
ω, the electrodonating and electroaccepting powers, ω– and ω+, and the net electrophilicity
Δω± attain minimum values. Thus, it can
be said that, as an approximation, the protease inhibition ability
for these antifungal tripeptides has a behavior related to the inverse
of the mentioned global reactivity descriptors.

Conclusions
In this work, the chemical reactivity of a group of five recently
synthesized antifungal tripeptides with therapeutic potential, FAR,
FAY, FVY, FWC, and FWY, was studied by resorting to CDFT as a tool
to explain the molecular interactions.

The information about
the global and local reactivity descriptors
of the tripeptides acquired in this work could be helpful to assist
in the design of new pharmaceutical drugs based on these compounds.

Among the many descriptors that could be useful for the development
of new medicines, pKa is of paramount
importance because it is related to the water solubility of the drugs.
Thus, when the experimental values of pKa are unknown, the approximate QSAR relationship employed in this
work could be a useful predictive tool for the determination of the
pKa’s of small and large peptides.

Finally, the molecular properties related to the bioavailability
and the descriptors used for the quantification of the bioactivity
allowed the characterization of the studied antifungal tripeptides,
establishing some relationships between the bioactivity properties
and the calculated global reactivity descriptors.
