Herein, graphene oxide (GO) was suitably
functionalized to obtain
carboxylated and fluorinated GO (GOCOOH and GOF) derivatives, respectively,
via the Hunsdiecker reaction. Electrospun mats of poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF)/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF fibers were then prepared
by electrospinning from well-dispersed GO derivatives. The piezoelectric
coefficient (d33), as measured using piezoelectric
force measurement (PFM), enhanced by more than 2 folds with respect
to the control PVDF spun mat. The piezoelectric coefficient though
enhanced upon the addition of GO and GOCOOH, however, enhanced significantly
in the case of GOF. For instance, a drastic increase in piezoelectric
response from 30 pm V–1(electrospun neat PVDF) to
63 pm V–1 (for electrospun PVDF/GOF) was observed
as revealed from PFM results. The phase transformation in these fibers
was systematically investigated by various techniques such as Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), wide angle X-ray diffraction
(XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and PFM. FTIR and XRD results revealed
that the electrospun fiber mats showed predominantly β-PVDF.
Interestingly, the highest β content was obtained in the presence
of GOF. The drastic enhancement in β phase is due to the presence
of highly electronegative fluorine. The addition of GOCOOH and GOF
in PVDF not only increases the polar β phase but also changes
the piezoelectric response significantly. More interestingly, PVDF/GOF
films exhibited higher energy density and dielectric permittivity
when compared with the control PVDF samples. These findings will help
guide the researchers working in this field from both theoretical
understanding and practical view point for energy storing device and
charge storage electronics.

Introduction
The ever increasing interest in electronic
devices with high piezoelectric
coefficient, which includes polymers, ceramics, and polymer ceramic
composites, has become the focus of many research areas. These piezoelectric
materials are used in many fields from sensors, capacitors, actuators,
and energy storing devices. So far, polymers such as nylon-11,1 polylactic acid,2 poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid),3 and poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF)4 have shown piezo- and
pyroelectric properties. As compared to ceramics, polymers have advantages
such as flexibility, biocompatibility, and toughness.5 Among the various piezoelectric polymers, PVDF is a semicrystalline
polymer, which crystallizes in four crystalline phases namely; α,
β, γ, and δ.6,7 The α phase, which
is nonpolar with monoclinic TGTG conformation, is thermodynamically
stable, is obtained by cooling from the melt, and does not show piezoelectric
properties.8,9 The β phase, on the other hand, which
is polar with all trans (TTT) conformation is thermodynamically unstable
and is difficult to obtain.10 The β
phase also has high dipole moment as compared to the other phases
because of the conformation of hydrogen and fluorine on the opposite
side of the polymer chain (nonzero dipole moment).11 Piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials with high piezoelectric
coefficients are required for energy storage devices. Because the
piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of PVDF depend strongly
on the structural orientation of β crystal, recent publications
deal mostly with the investigation of β phase.

Various
strategies have been developed to induce β phase
in PVDF. The β phase in PVDF can be obtained by various strategies
such as shear, uniaxial stretching,12,13 rolling,14 and polling under high electric field.15,16 It can also be facilitated by blending with an amorphous polymer
such as poly(methyl methacrylate) at low concentration (<20%) under
shear.17 For example, from our previous
study, maximum amount of β phase was obtained by shearing PVDF
at high temperature (220 °C) and isothermally crystallized at
155 °C. Here, the gap between the temperature at which the sample
is sheared and the crystallization temperature played an important
role in the transformation of α to β.18 A similar study on PVDF demonstrated that maximum β
content of 82% and higher piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 21 pC/N) was achieved by stretching PVDF films.19 Another study showed that the relation of β
phase content and dielectric coefficient through uniaxial stretching
and found that the samples with higher β phase content showed
the maximum piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 34 pC/N) because of higher oriented dipoles in β.20 Mohammadi et al. also reported a high piezoelectric
coefficient of d33 = 33 pC/N for samples
with a higher amount of β phase during drawing.21 At a high strain rate, the relaxation is low, leading to
higher transformation of α to β and higher orientation
of crystals. In general, PVDF processed by various methods lead to
enhanced amount of β phase, but the piezoelectric coefficient
was very less. Although blending gives a maximum amount of β
phase, the dielectric coefficient was low as compared to ceramics.
For example, Li et al. enhanced the dielectric coefficient (from 3.6
to 9 pC/N) by blending PVDF with polyamide (PA11) with the addition
of styrene and maleic anhydride (SMA). The addition of SMA enhanced
the polarization of PA11/PVDF resulting in improved dielectric coefficient.22

To increase the piezoelectric coefficient,
many researchers have
been focusing on the incorporation of nanoparticles in PVDF such as
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxides (GOs). The addition of
CNTs in PVDF increases the β phase because of rapid crystallization
offered by nucleating agents such as multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs).23 At 0.2 wt % MWCNT, maximum amount of β
phase was obtained and, in addition, enhanced the piezoelectric coefficient
for drawn and poled samples. However, agglomeration of nanotubes during
processing and poor interfacial adhesion with the matrix limit their
application.24 Recently, electrospinning
has been used to fabricate PVDF/GO nanofibers. The fibers displayed
a higher piezoelectric coefficient and an enhanced β phase at
1.0 wt % GO.25 Jiang et al. also demonstrated
that the incorporation of GO in PVDF exhibits enhanced dielectric
properties as compared to the neat sample.26 Another study showed enhanced ferroelectric and dielectric properties
by incorporating reduced GO in PVDF. This was attributed to polarization
and specific interaction of PVDF with oxygen functional groups in
RGO.27 Rahman and Chung observed enhanced
normalized strain and remnant polarization by adding low concentrations
of RGO (0.3 wt %) in PVDF.28

Chlorine-doped
carbon materials showed excellent dielectric constant
and electrical conductivity. For example, chlorine doped in reduced
GO/polymer enhanced dielectric constant compared to control samples.
The high dipole moment and high polarization present in the C–Cl
bond is responsible for the increase in dielectric property.29 Similarly, thionyl chloride (SOCl2)-treated single-wall CNTs showed both enhanced mechanical and electrical
conductivity because of charge transfer complex formed by chlorination.30 Furthermore, increase in dielectric properties
was reported by doping chlorine in GO/poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanocomposites.31 Although many GO-based PVDF composites for various
property enhancements have been reported in the literature, the effect
of GO doped with fluorine (GOF) did not receive much attention. The
effects of addition of GOF on the phase transformation, piezoelectric
response, energy density, and dielectric permittivity in PVDF require
systematic analysis to understand the exciting properties offered
by fluoro-doped GO derivatives.

In this work, GO was doped with
fluorine (GOF) and was used as
a nanoadditive, because of their versatile properties such as magnetic
resonance imaging32 and good dielectric
permittivity, efficient microwave absorber, and cathode for batteries.33 Herein, we report significant enhancement in
piezoelectric coefficient, energy density, and dielectric permittivity
in electrospun PVDF fibers with fluoro-doped graphene derivatives.
The electrospinning process has been used to fabricate PVDF/GOF nanofibers.
The conformational transformation of PVDF/GOF nanofibers was analyzed
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD). The piezoelectric coefficient for the electrospun fibers was
investigated by piezoelectric force measurement (PFM).

Experimental
Section
Materials
PVDF (Kynar-761, with Mw of 440 000 g/mol) was obtained from Arkema Inc. GO
was procured from BT COM. Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and Selectfluor
were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. All solvents [dimethylacetamide
(DMAC) and acetone] used were of analytical grade and procured from
S.D. Fine Chemicals (India). All the reagents were used as received
without further purification.

Synthesis of GOCOOH and
GOF
First, GOCOOH was synthesized
from GO as previously reported.34 A schematic
illustrating the synthesis of carboxylated and fluorine-doped graphene
oxide is presented in Scheme 1. GO powder (350 mg) was dispersed in deionized water (350
mg) by sonication for 1 h, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 14 g) and sodium
chloroacetate (ClCH2COONa, 19.6 g) were added and stirred
for 1 h at room temperature. To adjust the pH dilute HCl was added.
The GOCOOH colloid was centrifuged with ethanol and water. The GOCOOH
sample was obtained after being freeze-dried for 24 h.

Scheme 1 Schematic
Presentation of the Synthesis of Fluorine-Doped Graphene
Oxide
To synthesize GOF, we adopted
a procedure that was reported previously.35 GOCOOH (300 mg) was dissolved in distilled water.
Then, 1 g of selectfluor and 0.1 g silver nitrate were added. The
reaction mixture was stirred for 10 h at 90 °C under an atmosphere
of nitrogen. Then, the mixture was centrifuged with ethyl acetate
(3 × 15 mL) and water for 15 min at 8000 rpm to remove organic
impurities. After being freeze-dried for 24 h, GOF was obtained.

PVDF/GOF nanofiberes PVDF/GOF nanofiberes were obtained by dissolving
in a mixture of solvents [DMAC and acetone (4:6 by v/v)]. First, PVDF
powder was dissolved in these solvents under magnetic stirring for
2 h at 60 °C. GOF was sonicated and dispersed in these solvent.
GOF (1 wt %) was used because it is possible to achieve maximum amount
of piezoelectric β phase. Mixtures of PVDF/GOF were stirred
using a magnetic stirrer for 2 h at 60 °C. For comparison, neat
PVDF and PVDF/GO were similarly prepared. Electrospinning of PVDF/GOF
solution was done with an injection rate of 0.5 mL/h and at a bias
value of 25 kV. The distance from the needle tip to the collector
was 12 cm. After spinning, the electrospun fibers were dried under
vacuum at room temperature for 24 h.

For dielectric properties,
different PVDF composites were prepared
by using HAAKE extruder CTWS at 220 °C for 20 min with a screw
speed of 60 rpm under the nitrogen atmosphere. The concentrations
of the particles were similar to those of the electrospun fibers.
Finally, melt mixed samples were subsequently compression-molded into
thin films pressed for 5 min at 10 bar. The film thickness was about
120 μm.

Characterization
of GO, GOCOOH, and GOF
Chemical structures
of GO, GOCOOH, and GOF were analyzed by FTIR using an attenuated total
reflectance by accumulating 16 scans in the frequency range of 4000–50
cm–1. XRD was carried out using Cu Kα radiation
(40 kV), a scan rate of 0.04° s–1, and 10–60°
range of 2θ. Raman spectra of the samples were performed with
a LabRAM XploRA Raman spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon SAS).

Characterization
of Electrospun Fibers
FTIR and XRD
measurements were performed to obtain information about the conformational
transformations of PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF fibers. The
morphology of the fibers was evaluated using a ZEISS Ultra 55 field
emission scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage
of 5 kV. Electrospinning was done on the Pt/Ti coated silicon substrate.
The piezoelectric coefficient (d33) was
measured using a Bruker AFM in piezo-mode under the applied voltage
−12 to 12 V. Dielectric measurements were performed using an
Alpha-N Analyzer, Novocontrol (Germany), in a frequency range of 0.01
≤ ω ≤ 107 Hz.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of GO Derivatives
FTIR
was carried on different graphene derivatives (GO, GOCOOH, and GOF).
The results are presented in Figure 1a. GO indicated peaks at 3263 cm–1 (O–H group stretching vibrations), 1722 cm–1 (C=O stretching of the carboxylic functional groups), and
1035 cm–1(C–O group stretching vibrations).36 As explained in the Experimental
Section, GO was activated by acetic acid to convert hydroxyl
groups to carboxylic acid (COOH). Upon fluorination, GOF was obtained.
As compared to GO and GOCOOH, the peak intensity at 1600 cm–1 assigned to the C=C bond decreased in GOF. This is attributed
to the formation of C–F bond through the attack of carbon atom
in C=C by fluorine. This can be further verified by the peak
at 1090 cm–1 ascribed to the semi-ionic C–F
bond.37 Therefore, this result confirms
the successful fluorination of the GO.

XRD, and (c) Raman spectra of GO, GOCOOH,
and GOF Conformational transformation by FTIR and XRD electrospun
fibers.

The structural differences between
GO, GOCOOH, and GOF were further
investigated by XRD. GOCOOH and GOF showed different characteristic
peaks as compared to GO (Figure 1b). The characteristic peaks at 2θ = 31.7°
and 44.6° for GOCOOH can be attributed to the interlayer spacing
of 0.235 and 0.203 nm. GOF showed characteristic peaks at 2θ
= 27.8°, 32.2°, and 46.3° ascribed to the interlayer
spacing of 0.318, 0.276, and 0.195 nm. However, GOCOOH and GOF do
not exhibit characteristic peak of GO. It is well-reported that the
increase in average interlayer spacing in GOF is due to the atomic
radius of F being larger than that of the oxygen atoms.

It is
well-reported that the Raman spectra of pristine graphite
show two peaks at 1580 cm–1 (G-band) and 1350 cm–1 (D-band).38−40 The peak at 1580 cm–1 corresponds to the E2g mode of sp2 hybridized
graphitic carbon atom, and the D-band is associated with vibrations
of disordered graphite carbon atoms with dangling bonds. Figure 1c illustrates the
Raman spectra of GO, GOCOOH, and GOF. All the samples show two strong
Raman peaks. Hence, the ratio between the intensities of G-band and
D-band (ID/IG) provide valuable information on the number of defects.41,42 The values decrease from 1.09 for GO to 1.05 and 0.99 for GOCOOH
and GOF, respectively. This is due to the defects introduced by carboxylic
acid (COOH) and fluorine atom. An explanation for the decrease of ID/IG ratio is due
to the double bond formed during the formation of GOCOOH and GOF.
The decrease in the ID/IG ratio of GOF compared to that of GO and GOCOOH indicates
the decrease number of aromatic rings, presumably because of the fluorination.36 Therefore, this result coincides with the FTIR
and XRD, indicating the successful fluorination of GO to GOF.

A recent study showed that the addition of GO and mechanical deformation
induces β phase in PVDF. The interaction between the functional
groups of GO and the −CF2 or −CH2 groups of PVDF are responsible for this phase transformation.43 For example, El Achaby et al. enhanced the β
phase by incorporating GO in PVDF using the solvent casting method.
This was attributed to the specific interaction between −C=O
of GO and CF2 of PVDF.44 The
incorporation of functionalized CNTs (MWCNTs) (functionalized with
COOH, NH2, and OH) induces polar β phase in PVDF.45 Highest fraction of β phase was obtained
with amino-functionalized MWCNTs. This was attributed to better dispersion
and surface interaction, which led to the formation of electoactive
β phase. It was also reported that polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated
MWCNTs/PVDF nanocomposites promote polar β phase because of
the nucleating agents of nanotubes.46 Here,
GO was functionalized with COOH and fluorine, and GOCOOH and GOF were
used as nanoadditives in the PVDF matrix. Conformational transformations
of electrospun fibers were analyzed by FTIR. The FTIR spectra of the
electrospun PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF are presented in Figure 2a,b. The characteristic
vibration bands of the α phase appear at 480, 763 cm–1 (CF2 bending and skeletal bending), 795 cm–1 (CH2 rocking), and 975 cm–1 (CH2 twisting), while those of β phase appear at 510 cm–1 (CF2 bending) and 840 cm–1 (CH2 rocking).47,48 The α phase of
PVDF has a unique IR absorption band at 763 cm–1. The presence of exclusively β phase can be observed through
the presence of bands at 510 and 840 cm–1. Thus,
absorption bands at 763 and 840 cm–1 have been used
to evaluate the changes in the fraction of α and β phases
in all the samples. From our previous work, neat PVDF without electrospinning
showed a mixture of α and β phases. To ascertain the effect
of electrospinning and incorporation of functionalized and unfunctionilized
GO in PVDF were electrospun. From Figure 2, it is evident that all electrospun fibers
showed increase in height intensity at 840 cm–1 ascribed
to polar β phase and diminished peak intensity at 763 cm–1 corresponding to α phase. Moreover, this phenomenon
was more pronounced in the case of PVDF/GOF composites. This shows
electrospinning and addition of functionalized GO (GOCOOH and GOF)
play an important role in the phase transformation from α to
β phase. This can be explained as follows: the increase in the
intensity of height peak for the β phase after electrospinning
could be due to the elongation of the jet fluids which made it easier
for the polymer chains to orient along the fiber axis to produce a
more polar β-phase.49

Figure 2 (a,b) FTIR spectra of
electrospun PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF
fibers and (c) XRD of PVDF/GOF fibers.

To quantify the fraction of β-phase in each sample,
IR absorption
bands at 763 and 840 cm–1 were chosen (characteristic
of the α and β phases, respectively). Assuming that IR
absorption follows the Lambert–Beer law, the Aα and Aβ absorbencies,
at 763 and 840 cm–1, respectively, can be estimated
as 1   2  where L and C refer to the sample
thickness and average total monomer concentration,
respectively. The incident and transmitted intensity radiations are
given by I0 and I. The
subscripts α and β refer to the two crystalline phases
present in the sample. The Aα and Aβ values were determined by I0 and I at 763 and 840 cm–1, respectively. K is the absorption coefficient,
while X represents the degree of crystallinity of
each phase. Kα and Kβ are the absorption coefficients of the respective
bands50 (Kα = 6.1 × 104 and Kβ = 7.7 × 104 cm2/mol); Xα and Xβ are the
% crystallinity of the respective phases. The relative β fraction, F(β), was calculated as 3  

From FTIR, the amount of β phases (F(β))
content increases with incorporation of nanoparticles. For instance,
neat PVDF showed 38% β, PVDF/GO showed 70% β, PVDF/GOCOOH
showed 79% β, and PVDF/GOF showed 89% β. This implied
that incorporation of GO doped with fluorine increases the content
of β phases drastically. The effect of addition of CoFe2O4 coated with surfactants aided in β phase
in PVDF.51 The results revealed that higher
fraction of polar β phase was obtained with nanoparticles coated
with negatively charged moieties. This is attributed to the interaction
of highly negatively coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles
with CH2 group of the polymer. Under this frame work, we
can conclude that the high fraction of electroactive β phase
in PVDF/GOF is due to the presence of high electronegativity fluorine,
which makes GO more electrostatically charged leading to higher interaction.
In general, the electrospinning process and addition of functionalized
GO by fluorine showed maximum amount of polar β phase as compared
to others.

The presence of different phases was further confirmed
by XRD. Figure 2b shows
the XRD pattern
of electrospun PVDF/GOF fibers. It is well-reported that characteristic
peaks at 18.4°, 20°, and 26.2° ascribed to the diffraction
peaks (020), (110), and (021) of α phase and peak at 20.8°
ascribed to diffraction peak (200) for the electroactive β phase.52 From Figure 2c, electrospun PVDF/GOF showed a single peak at 2θ
= 20.8°, which is the characteristic peak for the β phase.
The strong β-phase observed in the PVDF/GOF composite can be
attributed to the improved hydrogen bond between the GOF sheets and
the PVDF chains, as well as the dipolar interaction between the C=O
bonds and the F atoms. From FTIR and XRD, we established that electrospun
PVDF/GOF results in the maximum β phase.

Morphology of Electrospun
Fibers
The piezoelectric
response of fibers depends on the applied voltage and diameter of
the fibers.53 The most important parameters
influencing the diameter of the fiber are solution viscosity, temperature,
surface tension, and distance between the tip and the collector.54 Le et al. found that the piezoelectric coefficient
of piezoelectric materials increases with decrease in the domain size.
This is attributed to many nucleation sites exposed by the fine domains,
results in reduction of the coercive field.53 The microstructures and dimensions of electrospun fibers were studied
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 3a–c shows the SEM images of PVDF/GO,
PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF fibers, respectively. From Figure 3, it is evident that the fibers
are continuous and exhibit closely packed fiber morphology. No beaded
fibers were observed under the applied spinning condition. The average
diameters of all fibers are 600–700 nm, measured from the SEM
images. The mean diameter of the fibers was shown in the inset histogram.
This diameter was used to measure the piezoelectric response. Figure 3d shows the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of nanofiber-containing GOF. It is
well-evident that GOF is present along the fiber direction.

PVDF/GOF (the mean diameter of fibers as deduced from the histogram
is shown as an inset), and (d) TEM image of PVDF/GOF (arrows indicating
the presence of GOF).

Piezoelectric Response of Electrospun Fibers
To evaluate
the piezoelectric response, PFM images of the electrospun fibers were
captured. The PFM tip was fixed in the electrospun fiber, and voltage
was applied across the fiber. The voltage induces structural deformation
within the fibers. The strain of the fiber is detected by a cantilever
tip. The magnitude of the amplitude and phase obtained from piezoresponse
determines the polarization and domain structure of the fibers. Figure 4a,b shows the PFM
images of amplitude and phase PVDF/GOF images, respectively, on which
PFM was carried out. The amplitude and phase images provide information
about the magnitude of piezoelectric response and orientation of domains
in the fiber, respectively.

PFM amplitude image,
(b) PFM phase image PVDF/GOF fibers, and (c) PFM phase versus voltage
hysteresis loop of PVDF/GOF.

The hysteresis loop obtained under the applied electric field
provides
information about ferroelectric properties of the material. Figure 4c illustrates the
phase versus applied voltage for PVDF/GOF fibers. PVDF/GOF shows 180°
switching hysteresis loop. Baji et al. explained that the 180°
switching hysteresis loop is due to the stress induced by the tip,
which leads to domain rearrangement and affects piezoelectric response.

Figure 5a,b shows
the piezoelectric response for the samples measured by piezoresponse
force measurement (PFM). From these figures, it can be revealed that
the maximum amplitude from PFM was found to be 4.8, 5.5, and 7.5 nm
for PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF, respectively, at E = 12 V. The piezoelectric coefficient of electrospun fibers were
calculated by using the following 4  where S refers to the total
strain or amplitude, d33 refers to the
piezoelectric coefficient, and E corresponds to the
applied electric field.55

Figure 5 PFM amplitude vs dc voltage

12 V) hysteresis loops for (a) PVDF/GOCOOH and (b) PVDF/GOF.

The piezoelectric coefficient
(d33)
of electrospun PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF fibers was compared.
From previous work, the piezoelectric coefficient of electrospun neat
PVDF was ca. 30 pm V–1.55 From Figure 5a,b,
it was revealed that the piezoelectric coefficient of PVDF/GO is 40
pm V–1 and increased to 46 pm V–1 for PVDF/GOCOOH. This result shows that the addition of GOCOOH to
PVDF does not enhance the piezoelectric coefficient. Interestingly,
after addition of GOF (PVDF/GOF), a drastic increase to 63 pm V–1 was observed. Baji et al. showed that maximum amount
of d33 was obtained by the incorporation
of BaTiO3 in PVDF. An explanation for the increase in the
piezoelectric coefficient is due to the polarization effect of PVDF
and BaTiO3.56 A drastic increase
in dielectric permittivity of GOF as compared to GO was reported by
Sudeep et al. because of the charge separation induced by fluorine
which acts as a polarization center.33 From
this point of view, the increase in the piezoelectric coefficient
with the addition of GOF is attributed to the increase of the content
of β phase as revealed by FTIR results and to the polarization
effect of GOF and PVDF. Comparable values of d33 of various PVDF based fibers are presented in Table 1. The d33 value significantly enhanced in fluorine-doped GO as compared
to Ag-decorated CNT and barium titanate (Table 1).

Dielectric Properties and Energy Density
A recent study
showed that incorporation of reduced graphene derivatives enhances
the dielectric properties of PVDF. For instance, Zheng et al. has
demonstrated that incorporation of reduced graphene derivatives exhibit
enhanced dielectric permittivity and low dielectric loss as compared
to samples without undergoing the reduction reaction.57 This was attributed to strong interfacial interaction between
the PVDF matrix and reduced graphene derivatives. The frequency dependent
dielectric constant and dielectric loss of PVDF doped with various
graphene derivatives of compression-molded samples are presented in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6a, the PVDF composite
doped with fluorine exhibits enhanced dielectric constant. The result
reveals that the incorporation of fluorinated GO significantly enhances
the dielectric constant of PVDF composites. This can be due to the
fluorine group in GOF that can trap electrons and lead to large charge
accumulation at the interface. Thus, the charge separation induced
by fluorine, which acts as the polarization center, leads to enhanced
dielectric constant as shown in Figure 6a. Thus, the increase in the dielectric constant of
PVDF/GOF is due to increase in polarization at the interface. The
changes in loss tangent of compression-molded samples measured at
room temperature are presented in Figure 6b. The dielectric losses for all composites
are relatively low.

Figure 6 Frequency dependence of (a) dielectric constant and (b)
dielectric
loss for PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF composites.

The P–E loop of PVDF doped
with various graphene derivatives is illustrated in Figure 7. The incorporation of fluorinated
GO into PVDF induces enhanced polarization. It can be seen that fluorine-doped
composite (PVDF/GOF) showed highest saturation polarization as compared
to PVDF/GOCOOH and PVDF/GO composites. This result also benefits the
energy density and the efficiency of the composites. The energy density
of PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF reaches value of 0.1 J/cm3 at 500 kV/cm, 0.3 J/cm3 at 500 kV/cm, and 1.2
J/cm3 at 950 kV/cm, respectively. The substantial enhancement
of the energy density in the PVDF/GOF film is a result of the increase
of the breakdown strength. The results illustrated that doping with
fluorine is a useful way of enhancing the energy density of PVDF films.

PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF at room temperature.

Conclusions
In this study, the effects of GO and functionalized
GO (GOCOOH
and GOF) on the piezoelectric response and crystalline structure of
PVDF were investigated. Different PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF
fibers were prepared by the electrospinning technique. The results
revealed that the as-received PVDF exhibits ca. 38% β phase.
However, interestingly electrospinning enhanced the amount of β
phase content in PVDF in the presence of GO, GOCOOH, and GOF. Quantitatively,
the amounts of β phase for PVDF/GO, PVDF/GOCOOH, and PVDF/GOF
are 69, 79, and 89% respectively. The results indicate that an enhanced
amount of β phase content was observed in all the fibers as
compared to control PVDF samples. This fact can be explained by uniaxial
stretching of the samples by the electrospinning process, which leads
to the transformation of α-phase into polar β-phase aided
by graphene derivatives. The effect is more pronounced in electrospun
PVDF fibers in the presence of GOF as compared to GOCOOH and GO. The
piezoelectric coefficient of the fiber mats increased with the addition
of GO, GOCOOH, and GOF in PVDF. The pressed samples of PVDF/GOF exhibited
a maximum dielectric constant of 15 and an energy density of 1.2 J/cm3. The mechanisms behind this drastic enhancement are due to
the charge separation induced by fluorine, which acts as a polarization
center, and due to the increase in the amount of β phase in
PVDF/GOF fibers. Taken together, our study clearly demonstrates that
addition of fluoro-doped graphene derivatives can offer exciting properties
such as electoactive β phase, enhanced piezoelectric coefficient,
and high energy density.
