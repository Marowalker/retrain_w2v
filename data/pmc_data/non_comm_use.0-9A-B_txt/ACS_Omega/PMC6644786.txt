Here we report one-pot,
straightforward synthesis of hybrid conjugated
oligomer-silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by utilizing tertiary alkyl
amine and fluorene-benzothiodiazole-containing conjugated oligomer
that both acts as a reducing agent in the reduction of silver ions
into metallic silver and as a matrix to accommodate the newly formed
AgNPs. By tuning the reaction conditions, it is possible to control
the sizes and the structural features of hybrid nanoparticles as either
raspberry or core–shell type hybrid structures.

Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic nanostructures
containing metals
(e.g., Ag and Au) and polymers are very intriguing materials, as they
combine the flexible and tailorable features of polymers with optical,
electrical, and photophysical properties of metals, and because of
these synergistic properties, they can find applications in areas
including catalysis, plasmonic lasers, sensing, and theranostics.1−6

Hybrid nanoparticles of polymers with Au or Ag can be prepared
by chemical reduction of Au or Ag salts using a variety of polymers.7−18 Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is one of most widely used
reducing agents, but recently, the need of additional reducing agents
like NaBH4 has been eliminated by employing polymers as
both reducing and stabilizing agents.7−17 Hybrid NPs can be prepared in organic solvents or in aqueous media
depending on the polymers used. For the preparation of water-dispersible
hybrid nanoparticles, usually amphiphilic block copolymers10−15 that can self-assemble into micellar or vesicle structures in water
or water-soluble hyperbranched polymers8 and dendrimers17 are used because the
interior of these nanostructures can accommodate metal ions in high
concentration and act as a microreactor to facilitate the reduction
of metal ions without the need of extra reducing agents and subsequently
stabilize the newly formed metal nanoparticles.

As can be seen
from the above literature examples, there are numerous
studies on functionalizing of Au or Ag NPs with polymers, but the
examples are relatively scarce on the use of conjugated and light-emitting
polymers or oligomers for functionalization of Au or Ag NPs, although
the synergistic effect of the both materials could offer many opportunities
in the areas of nanophotonics and theranostics. For instance, gold
and silver nanostructured materials having surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) in the near-infrared region (NIR) have been widely used for
NIR-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT). It would also be possible
to combine photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic therapies in a single
theranostic platform.19 For this purpose,
organic dye-based photosensitizers that exhibit the photodynamic effect
upon light irradiation have been incorporated to the gold or silver
nanoparticles.20 However, these dyes are
usually attached to metal nanoparticles through noncovalent interactions
that might cause the leakage of these dyes and a decrease in the efficiency.
Moreover, these small organic dyes suffer from low photostability.

To this end, the hybrid of Ag or Au with conjugated polymer nanoparticles
(CPNs) could be a good candidate for this and for many other applications
because of CPNs’ easy synthesis, tailorable chemical structures
with desired functionalities, intrinsic and tunable emission properties,
negligible toxicities, and high photostabilities.21−23 Owing to these
features they have been used in a variety of applications spanning
from photonics to biomedical areas.21−33 In the literature there are also some examples for hybrid nanostructures
of CPNs with metal nanoparticles.34,35 In these examples,
usually preprepared gold nanoparticles were mixed with conjugated
polymers to form raspberry-type hybrid particles or embedded into
conjugated polymer nanoparticles.36−42 The photocatalytic applications of these nanoparticles have also
been demonstrated.43,44

However, in the literature,
to the best of our knowledge, there
are no examples on the one-pot synthesis of hybrid nanoparticles of
conjugated oligomers/polymers and silver/gold nanoparticles, in which
the oligomer or polymer acts as a reducing agent to reduce the metal
ions to form nanoparticles as well as acts as a matrix to hold the
newly formed metal nanoparticles.

In this context, here, we
report the one-pot, straightforward synthesis
of hybrid conjugated oligomer/Ag nanoparticles. Tertiary alkyl amine
and fluorene-benzothiodiazole-containing conjugated oligomer acted
as reducing agents for reducing Ag ions into Ag(0) and then as a matrix
to encapsulate and provide binding sites for the newly formed silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs). Using this conjugated oligomer, it is possible
to tune the structural features of hybrid nanoparticles. Hybrid NPs
can be prepared in the form of raspberry-type structures, in which
AgNPs will form in situ on the periphery of preprepared conjugated
oligomer nanoparticles (COL-NPs) or core–shell type structures.
We have also preliminarily shown that this approach could be applied
for the reduction of gold ions to prepare hybrid gold nanoparticles.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis
In this work, red-emitting
conjugated oligomer
(COL), namely, 3,3′,3″,3‴-{[(1E,1′E)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diylbis(ethene-2,1-diyl)]-bis(9H-fluorene-9,9,2-triyl)}-tetrakis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine), and its nanoparticle dispersion
in water, for which the synthesis and characterization were reported
in our previous publications, was used.30,33

To prepare
hybrid nanoparticles of conjugated oligomer and silver, we have adopted
two different routes, as shown in Scheme 1. In the first route (route A), we have first
prepared COL-NP using the nanoprecipitation method, in which COL was
dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the THF solution of COL was
injected into large excess of water under sonication. THF was evaporated
off to obtain aqueous dispersion of COL nanoparticles (COL-NP). To
this aqueous dispersion of CO-NPs, aqueous solution of silver nitrate
was added in varying ratios. The reaction was followed by UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy over time.

Scheme 1 Schematic Presentation of the Synthesis
of Hybrid COL-Ag NPs Using
Two Different Approaches
In the second route (route B), instead of first preparing
the oligomer
nanoparticles and then adding the aqueous solution of AgNO3 to allow AgNP formation, we have injected COL THF solution into
aqueous AgNO3 solution at predetermined ratios while rapidly
stirring. In this way, COL chains self-assembled to form hybrid NPs
by encapsulating the silver ions when they were exposed to water and
Ag ions. Again, the reaction was monitored by UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy by following the appearance of the plasmonic band of
AgNP at around 430 nm.

Details of Route A
COL-NPs were
prepared briefly, as
follows. COL solution in THF (1 mg/mL) was injected into water under
sonication, and the sonication has continued for about 30 min. THF
was removed under reduced pressure to obtain water-dispersible red-emitting
COL-NPs. The hydrodynamic diameter of the COL-NPs was determined by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM as around 70 ± 10 nm (Figure 2a).

To prepare
hybrid COL-NPs with silver NPs, aqueous silver nitrate solution was
added at varying ratios to the preprepared COL-NPs aqueous dispersion.
The mixture was sonicated for a few minutes and kept in an airtight
container for at least 24 h at room temperature to allow for AgNP
formation before opening the flask. The reaction of AgNP formation
was monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy. Figure 1 shows the UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of COL-NP only and hybrid nanoparticles (COL-NP@AgNP)
with increasing concentration of Ag. At low concentration of AgNO3, changes in their UV–vis absorption bands are not
significant but from the ratio of 1:2 for COL-NP to AgNO3, the plasmonic band of the AgNPs is apparent as a shoulder at around
445 nm. The plasmonic band at 445 nm gradually increases with the
increasing concentration of Ag. In the PL intensity, a slight increase
is observed at the low concentrations of Ag but starting from the
ratio of 1:2 for COL to AgNO3, PLs of the COL-NPs are quenched
significantly.

Figure 1 (a) UV–vis absorption and (b) PL spectra of COL-NP
only
and COL-NP@AgNP at 25 °C, with increasing concentration of Ag.

To confirm the formation of AgNPs
and investigate the morphology
of the hybrid structures, we recorded their transmission electron
microscope (TEM) images, as given in Figure 2. As can be seen
from the TEM micrograph of the sample prepared at room temperature
(COL/AgNO3, 1:8), silver nanoparticles decorated the surface
of the nanoparticles. Figure 2b focuses on COL-NP with 88 nm diameter decorated with 9.7
nm diameter AgNPs. There are also some debrislike residues, which
are probably Ag clusters that will coalesce to form larger AgNPs over
time. Figure 2c shows
the coalesced small AgNPs leading to large particles on the periphery
of the COL-NPs. In the focused micrograph, COL-NP, with a diameter
of 77 nm, was surrounded by AgNPs with 18 nm diameter. Over time,
large aggregates and network type hybrid structures are formed (Figure 2d).

only; (b) COL-NP@AgNO3, 24
h later; (c) COL-NP@AgNO3, 48 h later; and (d) COL-NP@AgNO3, 1 week later.

Details of Route B
In this route, hybrid nanoparticles
were prepared by injecting the THF solution of COL into aqueous solution
of AgNO3. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min and then
THF was removed under reduced pressure to obtain stable hybrid COL-Ag
NPs in water. COL to Ag ratios, such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 2:1, 3:1, and
4:1, were used to investigate the concentration effect of silver in
the hybrid nanoparticle formation. Figure 3 shows the UV–vis and fluorescent
spectra of these nanoparticles prepared at different ratios. As can
be seen from the UV–vis spectra, even at the lowest concentration
of Ag, the plasmonic band of AgNPs appears at around 428 nm and at
high concentrations its intensity increases. Although there is a decrease
in the fluorescence emission intensity even at low Ag concentrations,
this decrease is not as significant as in the hybrid nanoparticles
prepared in route A. Especially at the low concentrations of Ag, there
is about a 30% decrease in the PL intensity.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis absorption
and (b) PL spectra of hybrid COL-Ag
NPs prepared at varying ratios of COL to AgNO3.

To reveal their morphologies and sizes, their TEM
images were taken
(Figure 4). As can
be seen from the TEM micrograph of the hybrid NPs, with the COL to
Ag ratio of 1:4 (Figure 4a), although AgNPs are evenly distributed, high concentration of
Ag causes the formation of aggregation and network type structures
(Figure 4a,b). By decreasing
the initial concentration of Ag ions, the hybrid nanoparticles become
more ordered and homogenous. The results indicate that depending on
the ratios of COL to Ag ions, it is possible to control the sizes
of hybrid nanoparticles and to prevent aggregate formation. It seems
that the ratios of COL to Ag ions of 2:1 and lower are suitable for
the synthesis of well-defined hybrid nanoparticles.

(c) 2:1, and (d) 4:1 and single oligomer–silver hybrid nanoparticle
as inset, (e) the EDX spectrum of a hybrid nanoparticle (one of the
hybrid nanoparticles shown in micrograph (d)) and focus given as inset,
(f) elemental mapping is also performed for Ag and S and drift-corrected
image given as inset. (TEM micrograph of a single oligomer nanoparticle
given as inset in (d) for the 4:1 (oligomer/Ag) sample is measured
as 47 nm with GATAN digital micrograph software, and the diameter
of the silver nanoparticle is found as 13 nm).

Chemical composition of the hybrid nanoparticles with the
COL to
Ag ratio of 4:1 (Figure 4d) was further investigated with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX), shown in Figure 4e, with the focus point given as inset. The spectrum confirms the
presence of silver as well as sulfur present in the structure of COL,
and Cu signal comes from the TEM grid. Elemental mapping is further
performed using drift correction, and given in Figure 4f. Ag is shown by pink and sulfur by purple.

Their sizes were also measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
(Figure 5). In the
case of the samples with high Ag concentrations, we were not able
to obtain reliable results because of the aggregate formation, as
this can also be seen in their TEM images. However, the diameter of
the hybrid nanoparticles with the ratios of COL to Ag as 2:1 and lower
were measured to be around 50 ± 5 nm. The sizes of COL-NPs without
Ag are also in the same range. These results are also in line with
the results taken from TEM images. For example, TEM image of a single
hybrid oligomer–Ag nanoparticle given as inset in Figure 4d for the 4:1 (oligomer–Ag)
sample is measured as 47 nm with GATAN digital micrograph software
and diameter of AgNPs is found as 13 nm.

COL-NPs and (b) hybrid COL-Ag NPs (COL/AgNO3, 4:1).

Although we were not able to obtain
a satisfactory XRD spectrum
with the hybrid NPs with low concentration of silver, the crystalline
nature of silver nanoparticles can be inferred from their TEM micrographs.
For instance, a TEM micrograph of one of the hybrid COL-Ag NPs with
low concentration of Ag composition (the ratio of 1:1) in Figure 6 (right panel) shows
regularly spaced horizontal lines probably due to the interplanar
spacing of the lattice fringe. However, this should be further supported
by taking the selected area diffraction pattern. Figure 6 (right panel) shows a TEM
micrograph of one of the hybrid COL-Ag NPs with low concentration
of Ag composition (the ratio of 1:1). However, COL to Ag ratio of
1:4 allowed us to do the XRD analysis for the hybrid NPs. XRD pattern
of the hybrid COL-Ag NPs is shown in Figure 6 (left panel).

Figure 6 TEM micrographs of the
hybrid COL-Ag NPs with the ratio of 1:1,
COL to Ag (right panel); XRD pattern of the hybrid COL-Ag NPs with
the ratio of 1:4, COL to Ag (left panel).

To prepare the sample for XRD analysis, the solution was
drop casted
onto very thin glass and the zero background holder was used in Theta/2
geometry. The spectrum was recorded at 30–90° using 0.05
step size and 45 s of counting time. Peaks were observed at 37.9,
44.2, 64.3, and 77.5° corresponding to planes (111), (200), (220),
and (311) of the face-centered cubic (FCC)-structured silver nanocrystal,
with reference number (ICDD reference code: 98-018-0878).

On
the basis of the literature precedents,45−48 we propose the following reaction
mechanism (Scheme 2) for the reduction of Ag ions to Ag(0) and subsequent AgNP formation.
The mechanisms are expected to be slightly different in each route
due to different coordination modes of silver ions. In route A, the
AgNP formation was observed to be slower than that in route B. In
route A, silver ions use the available surface amine groups and may
be aromatic fluorene and benzothiodazole groups are less likely accessible
for the coordination of Ag ions. As suggested in the reaction mechanism
scheme, probably due to close proximity of silver ions with amine
groups, one electron of the nitrogen of amine is transferred to Ag+, reducing Ag+ to Ag(0), and itself becomes a radical
cation by transferring a second electron of the radical cation to
another silver. The subsequent abstraction of one of the protons of
the methyl group by a nitrate ion will form an imine which will be
further attacked by water molecules by leading a simultaneous departure
of formaldehyde to leave behind secondary amine. After the formation
of formaldehyde, reduction of the remaining silver ions are expected
to be faster. Silver ions are reduced to metallic silver, and formaldehyde
is oxidized to formic acid.

Scheme 2 Proposed Reaction Scheme for the Reduction
of Silver Ions to Metallic
Silver and as a Result the Formation of Silver Nanoparticles
In the case of route B, first,
silver ions will be captured by
COL chains and then self-assembled Ag ions containing nanostructures
will be formed. Confined silver ions can coordinate with sulfur residues
and benzene rings of the oligomer backbone, forming π–ion
complexes as well as coordinating with amine groups. In the confined
environment, the electron transfer from amine nitrogen to Ag ion and
the consequent reduction of silver ions with the above proposed reaction
mechanism would be faster as the interior of the COL-NP will be providing
the microenvironment for the silver ions by catalyzing oxidation of
tertiary alkyl amine and reducing silver ions to metallic silver.
Moreover, formaldehyde formed during this reaction will be again confined
in this environment for further reaction with the available silver
ions.

Conclusions
We reported the one-pot, straightforward
synthesis of hybrid conjugated
oligomer with silver nanoparticles. We have tried two different methods
to prepare nanostructures. In the first method, first, COL-NPs were
prepared and these COL-NPs were decorated with AgNPs. COL-NPs acted
here as the reductant and supporting frame for the newly formed AgNPs
to be attached. There are some drawbacks in this design. AgNPs’
formation is slow, and it is difficult to control the sizes of AgNPs
as the small particles coalesce by forming larger nanoparticles. Moreover,
PL of the COL-NPs are significantly quenched and at high silver concentration
aggregates are formed. Using the second method, it is possible to
control the sizes and the morphology of the hybrid nanoparticles.
This method is simpler than the first method; hybrid nanoparticles
are prepared in a single step by injecting COL solution into aqueous
silver nitrate solution. AgNPs are formed in the interior of the COL-NPs
by the reduction of silver ions. There is no need to use an extra
reducing agent as COL acts as a reducing agent as well as a matrix
to encapsulate the newly formed AgNPs. Moreover, with this method,
by carefully adjusting the ratio of COL to Ag, we will be able to
keep PL properties of COL. We have also applied the second method
for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles, and our preliminary results
show the success of the method in the formation of gold nanoparticles.
Currently, we are working on the synthesis of other hybrid nanoparticles
using this method and exploring the application of these hybrid NPs
in various areas. We believe that these hybrid nanoparticles could
find variety of applications including photocatalysis, plasmonic sensing,
and theranostics.

Methods
Optical properties of oligomer
nanoparticles and silver-decorated
oligomer nanoparticles were characterized by a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Carry, UV–vis) and a florescence spectrophotometer (Carry
Eclipse Florescent Spectrophotometer). The morphologies of oligomer
and silver nanoparticle were investigated using focused ion beam scanning
electron microscopy (FEI, NanoSEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(FEI Technai G2 F30). Determination of the size distribution and average
diameter of nanoparticles with respect to their hydrodynamic sizes
were carried out via dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements (Malvern
Nano-ZS Zetasizer). Chemical and elemental analysis of nanoparticles
were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Measurements were performed with a spot size of
∼400 μm, 30 eV pass energy, and 0.1 eV step size. The
powder X-ray diffraction system (X’pert pro MPD (PANalytical))
to study the XRD patterns of the hybrid materials.

All chemicals
and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical
Co. (Germany), including silver nitrate salt. Detailed synthesis and
characterization of the oligomer were reported in our previous publications.30,33

Synthesis
of Nanoparticles
Route A: 1
mL of the THF solution of COL (1 mg/1 mL) was injected into 4 mL of
deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and then THF was
removed under reduced pressure. To prepare hybrid nanoparticles with
COL to Ag ratios of 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, aqueous AgNO3 solutions in predetermined concentrations were added to preprepared
aqueous dispersion of COL-NPs. The mixture was sonicated for 5 min.

Route B: Hybrid COL-Ag NPs were prepared, with the
COL to AgNO3 ratios as 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4.

In a
Typical Hybrid NP Synthesis (COL to AgNO3, 1:1)
COL (4.0 mg, 4.7 μmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of THF. AgNO3 (5.0 mg, 29.4 μmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of distilled
water. AgNO3 (aq) solution (160 μL) was placed into
a flask and the total volume was made up to 5 mL with distilled water.
During the sonication, 1 mL of the THF solution of COL was added into
this flask and the sonication continued further for 30 min. THF was
removed under reduced pressure to leave behind the dispersion of hybrid
nanoparticles.
