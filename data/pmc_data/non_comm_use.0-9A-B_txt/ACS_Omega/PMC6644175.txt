The reaction of copper(I) iodide
(CuI) and N-alkyl pyridinium (RPy+, R = H, Me, Et, n-propyl = Pr, n-butyl = Bu, n-pentyl = Pn, and n-hexyl = Hx) or N-butyl-3-substituted
pyridinium (N-Bu-3-PyX+, X = I, Br, Cl, CN, and OMe) iodide
salts yielded pyridinium
iodocuprate(I) salts. Crystal structures of iodocuprate ions coupled
with RPy+ include {Cu3I63–}n (R = H), {Cu2I3–}n (R = Me), {Cu3I4–}n (R = Et), {Cu6I82–}n (R = Pr), and {Cu5I72–}n (R = Bu, Pn, Hx).
The [N-Bu-3-PyX]+ ions were typically paired with the 1-D
chain {Cu5I72–}n. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy performed on the
[N-Bu-3-PyX]+ iodocuprate salts revealed that increasing
the electron withdrawing capacity of the [N-Bu-3-PyX]+ system
reduced the absorption edge of the iodocuprate salt. Variable temperature
emission spectra of several [N-Bu-3-PyX]+ compounds revealed
two emission peaks, one consistent with a cluster-centered halide
to metal charge transfer and the other consistent with an intermolecular
mixed halide/metal charge transfer to the organic cation. The emission
intensity and emission wavelength of the mixed halide/metal to cation
charge transfer depends on the organic cation substitution.

Introduction
Anionic metal halide
clusters show remarkable structural diversity
and are of interest for their electronic and photophysical properties.1 We are interested in the clusters of copper(I)
because of its variable coordination number, relative softness, and
photoemissive behavior.2 Similarly, iodide
possesses a large electron sphere which exhibits both softness and
coordinative flexibility, having been shown to bridge 2–8 Cu(I)
centers or acting as a terminal ligand. Thus, iodocuprate(I) clusters,
[CuyIx+y]x−, show great structural
diversity and have been prepared with various organic cations. The
secondary building units (SBUs) associated with these iodocuprates
span the range from zero- (molecular) to one-, two-, and three-dimensional
clusters. Because of their relative ease of formation, iodocuprates
are very well represented in the literature.3 Iodocuprates may be network or molecular, with cluster size varying
tremendously, ranging from [Cu2I3]− up to [Cu36I56]20–.

In order to prepare a tetraalkylammonium iodocuprate, the organic
salt is first prepared from a tertiary amine and an alkyl iodide,
reaction 1. Next, this salt is reacted with
copper(I) iodide according to reaction 2. However,
under solventothermal conditions, combined use of a tertiary amine,
an alcohol, and iodide source with CuI can directly give an iodocuprate
salt as shown in reaction 3.4−6 1   2   3  

It should be noted that the
products, which are given the simplified
formula R4N[CuI2] above, are anything but simple
or predictable. In fact, the two-coordinate CuI2– ion is quite rare,7 occurring instead
as larger iodocuprate clusters or networks. Moreover, despite a large
number of known examples, it remains almost impossible to predict
the stoichiometry of the particular iodocuprate formed under any given
circumstances. A single published study has probed the relationship
between cation volume and resulting anion cluster size.8 The authors used tetraalkylammonium cations with
varying alkyl chain length. They found that longer chain cations,
such as tetra-n-hexylammonium, tend to produce larger
iodocuprate clusters, such as [Cu8I11]3– and [Cu9I12]3–. These authors
noted that crystallization does not guarantee production of the lowest
energy anion and that anion transformations can take place even in
samples stored at low temperature. Our results below suggest a similar
behavior. Although arylinium salts derived from pyridine,5,6,9,10 4-cyanopyridine,11 quinoline,12 4,4′-bipyridine,11 bis(isoquinoline),13 and other aromatics6,14 have been reported for iodocuprates;
nevertheless, no systematic study of their anion structures or photophysical
behavior upon systematic variation of arylinium cations has been undertaken.

Photoluminescence behavior has been noted for iodocuprates having
both aliphatic and aromatic cations.1,3c,3d,4,14b In the former case, this must necessarily be the result of anion
cluster-centered and/or internal Cu(I) transitions. The question then
is whether pyridinium iodocuprates also show cation involvement through
charge transfer. In the present study, we set out to see (1) what
effect N-alkyl chain length would exert on iodocuprate cluster size
and (2) whether luminescence changes resulting from pyridinium ring
substitution by donor and acceptor groups would offer evidence of
charge transfer between the iodocuprate anion and the aromatic cation.
To carry out these studies, we chose the two sets of cations shown
in Chart 1. Varying
the R group = H, Me, Et, Pr (n-propyl), Bu (n-butyl), Pn (n-pentyl), and Hx (n-hexyl) with X = H allowed us to study the structural effects
of alkyl chain length (and thus cation volume). Alternatively, varying
X = Cl, Br, I, CN, and OMe with R = Bu allowed us to study inductive
effects on luminescence.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis
While solventothermal
methods have often
been used in their preparation, iodocuprate(I) complexes are readily
synthesized by simple ambient temperature and pressure stirring of
pyridinium iodide and copper(I) iodide in alcohol, as indicated in
reaction 2 above. In this way, iodocuprate(I)
complexes 1–12 were prepared as yellow, orange,
or red powders with very good yields. In actuality, reaction 2 is more complicated, as revealed by the variable
product stoichiometry, which was determined after-the-fact via elemental
analysis and X-ray crystallography. The reaction results are summarized
by modifying reaction 2 to give eq 4 4  

As indicated in Table 1, stoichiometric CuI/pyridinium cation parameter y/x has been found to vary between 1 and
3 for the twelve complexes studied herein. Moreover, the stoichiometry
revealed by analysis of bulk product did not always agree with that
of the X-ray crystal structure, in confirmation of previous observations.8 The bulk and crystallized products showed different
formulations for compounds 5, 7, and 10. Nevertheless, Table 1 reveals a strong preference for y = 2.5, that is, (pyridinium)2[Cu5I7]. This value was found as often as all the others combined.

X-ray Crystallography
Crystals of
the complexes were
readily grown from acetonitrile or acetone solution with ethyl ether
diffusion. Structures were solved for all complexes herein, except 2, 3, and 6. Complexes 2 and 3 are known structures, and unit cell determinations
were sufficient to confirm matches to the known structure in both
cases.4,5,10 In the case
of 6, serious disorder rendered full structure solution
nearly impossible, but nevertheless, clearly revealed a Cu5I72– cluster similar to the others seen
herein and in agreement with elemental analysis results. The structure
solution data and selected structural parameters for all compounds
are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

The X-ray crystal structure
of the parent pyridinium iodocuprate(I),
(HPy)3{Cu3I6} 1, is
shown in Figures 1, S13, and S14. The novel and unique structure
consists of isolated HPy+ cations and chain iodocuprate
anions. Both the cations and the anions sit on a mirror plane in the
monoclinic P21/m structure.
This plane bisects the pyridinium cation through the nitrogen and
para-carbon atoms. The C3v-symmetric Cu3I7 iodocuprate SBUs are also
bisected by this plane, resulting in only two crystallographically
independent Cu atoms and five such I atoms. The cluster is built on
a triangular tricopper cluster with close Cu···Cu interactions
of 2.7103(9) and 2.7315(11) Å. These are shorter than the 2.8
Å van der Waals sum for copper, but are larger than the metallic
copper value of 2.65 Å. Three μ2-bridging and
one μ3-bridging iodide over-gird the Cu3 triangle. Another iodide (I1) is terminal. The clusters share an
iodide (I5) which lies on the screw axis and has an unusual linear
coordination. This μ2-I bridging causes the clusters
to link into a chain with the formula Cu3I63–. Ignoring the Cu···Cu interactions,
the Cu geometry is nearly tetrahedral, with I–Cu–I bond
angles of 103.63(3)–113.92(2)°. There are only a few known
iodocuprates with the Cu3I63– formulation. These include closed19 and
open4 nonnetworked I-bridged Cu3 clusters and a chain consisting of Cu corner-sharing Cu3I4 SBUs.3c A previous synthesis
of pyridinium iodocuprate(I) in refluxing acetone produced a very
different product with the remarkable formula (HPy)24[Cu36I56]I4.9

structure of 1. Anion SBU emphasized by ball
and stick. Color scheme for all X-ray structures: orange = Cu, purple
= I, gray = C, blue = N, green = Cl, brown = Br, red = O.

The chain structure seen here for compound 1 appears
to be unique. The anionic chains in 1 are cross-linked
together by interactions with the pyridinium cation, forming sheets
(see Figure S13). One of the two independent
pyridinium cations forms three C–H···I hydrogen
bonds from the meta and para hydrogens to I5, I4, and I5′ on
a single anion chain, while also forming a N–H···I
hydrogen bond to I2 on another chain. The other pyridinium ion acts
in pairs to form links between anion chains, interacting with terminal
I1 via N–H···I on one chain and via C–H···I
to the μ2-I4 on another.

The structures of
the N-methyl pyridinium and N-ethyl pyridinium
iodocuprates are known, having the formulas [MePy]{Cu2I3}, 2,5,6,10 and [EtPy]{Cu3I4}, 3.5,6 Their structures are shown in Figure 2. Like the parent pyridinium complex 1, both 2 and 3 contain iodocuprate networks.
However, with larger Cu/pyridinium ratios y/x = 2 and 3 in 2 and 3, respectively,
the degree of iodocuprate networking is increased. The anion in 2 consists of a series of rippled Cu4I6 partial ladder SBUs composed of and linked together by edge-sharing
Cu2I2 rhombs. Iodide centers are μ2- and μ4-bridging. All copper centers are
nearly tetrahedral. Hydrogen-bonding interactions (C–H···I)
to MePy+ cations cross-link the ladders to form sheets.
In 3, the iodocuprate itself forms infinite planar sheets.
These consist of triangular Cu3(μ3-I)2 units that are linked by pairs of sheet-forming μ3-I at each copper producing D3h-symmetric Cu3I8 SBUs. At 2.97
Å, Cu···Cu distances within the Cu3 triangles are much longer than those in 1 and cannot
be considered bonding. The cations lie between these sheets, with
four C–H···I hydrogen bonds linking them to
the anionic layers and forming a 3-D network.

Anion SBU emphasized by ball and stick.

N-Propylpryridinium iodocuprate 4 was revealed
by
X-ray crystallography to have the formulation (PrPy)2{Cu6I8}·MeCN (see Figures 3 and S15–S17). The anionic network consists of Cu6I10 SBU
clusters in which all copper atoms are tetrahedral. The SBUs are bridged
together by edge-shared Cu2I2 rhombs, forming
an extended 2-D honeycomb network. Eight of the iodides in the SBU
are μ3-bridging and one each is μ2- and μ4-bridging. There is a continuous series
of close Cu···Cu interactions along the backbone of
the cluster (Figure S15). The shortest
of these are Cu1···Cu2A = 2.456(2) and Cu2A···Cu5A
= 2.649(16) and are thus shorter than the metallic bonding distance
for copper, although it should be noted that Cu2A and Cu5A are both
the major sites for Cu in two-site disorder. The pore size in the
network is 12.0 × 6.7 Å. One of the cations and the solvent
MeCN sit in the pores, while the other MeCN molecule lies between
the roughly planar anionic sheets. Four C–H···I
interactions with the anionic network are evident for the former MeCN
and only one in the case of the latter. Minor disorder is present
in one of the cations and in two copper positions in the anion network
(see Figure S17). To our knowledge, this
type of iodocuprate network is unique. A somewhat related network,
(N-benzyl pyridinium)2{Cu6I8}, shows
Cu3I7 SBUs that are linked by Cu2I2 rhombs, forming a 3-D channeled network.20

Figure 3 X-ray structure of 4. Anion SBU emphasized
by ball

N-Butylpyridinium iodocuprate 5 was found by X-ray
crystallography to have the formula (BuPy)4{Cu10I14} (see Figures 4 and S18–S20). The Cu10I144– cluster is a symmetrical
dimer composed of Cu5I7 SBUs in which all of
the Cu atoms are tetrahedral and there are three μ2-, two μ3- and two μ4-iodides.
As is common with iodocuprates, the SBUs are linked together via Cu2I2 rhombs, and as is the case with 3, Cu···Cu interactions follow the chains of fused
Cu2I2 rhombs (Figure S18). The Cu5I7 SBU is relatively common. It occurs
either as a molecular anion in which a Cu5 pentagon is
capped with two μ5-iodides and stellated with five
additional μ2-iodides21 or as an opened up and slightly rearranged version of this cluster
seen for 5. In 5 and related networks, two
of the Cu atoms have migrated toward the inside of the cluster, allowing
a pair of outer Cu–I to share edges and thus producing the
polymer seen here, which we will call a ribbon-cluster.3e,12,22

Anion SBU emphasized by
ball and stick; bottom: close interaction of cation with anion ribbon-cluster
emphasized.

The anionic ribbon-clusters
in 5 form zigzag threads
that propagate through the structure. The grooves in the zigzag are
occupied by cations, enabling significant cation–anion C–H···I
interactions. In the case of 5, each cation showed at
least one such interaction with the anion chains. Moreover, the Cu5I72– ribbon-cluster motif was
also identified for larger N-alkyl pyridiniums. Therefore, we decided
to use a series of substituted N-butyl pyridinium iodocuprates in
the second part of the study hoping to produce analogous Cu5I7 SBUs for consistency as we compared photophysical behavior
(see below).

Crystals of N-pentyl pyridinium (PnPy) and N-hexyl
pyridinium (HxPy)
iodocuprate(I) compounds 6 and 7 were also
examined by X-ray diffraction. The former was highly disordered and
a final structure was not readily achieved. Nevertheless, both structures
showed ribbon-clusters containing the Cu5I7 SBU,
proving to be (PnPy)2{Cu5I7} (6) and (HxPy)2{Cu5I7}·1/2MeCN
(7, see Figures 5, S21, and S22), respectively.
The ribbon-cluster anions in these complexes are essentially identical
to that in 5, the only significant difference being that
the anion repeat unit (and SBU) in 5, Cu10I144–, is twice as long as that seen
in 6 and 7, Cu5I72–. Compound 7 showed minor disorder in
both crystallographically independent cations. The cations in 7 both showed C–H···I interactions with
the anions, in particular, for cations that were located in the grooves
of the zigzag ribbon-clusters.

SBU emphasized by ball

For further comparison, polyhedral
diagrams of the iodocuprate(I)
anions for 1–5 are collected together in Figure 6. Shared in common
between all of the structures is the tetrahedral coordination of Cu(I)
and its tendency to engage in corner-, edge-, and/or face-sharing
with other tetrahedra. Examining network dimensionality as a function
of N-alkyl pyridinium chain length reveals interesting behavior. All
the iodocuprate anions reported herein, except that of 10 (see below), formed extended networks. There was no consistent motif
for the anions associated with the shorter alkyl chains for RPy+, R = H (1), Me (2), Et (3), and Pr (4). These produced corner- and edge-sharing
chains (1), edge-sharing ribbons (2), corner-
and edge-sharing sheets (3), and corner-, edge-, and
face-sharing 2-D honeycombs (4). In contrast, isostructural
anionic ribbon-cluster networks were found for each of the larger
N-alkyl pyridiniums (R = Bu, Pn, and Hx). These networks are constructed
of Cu5I7 SBUs that result from edge- and face-sharing
of tetrahedra. Thus, sufficiently large cation size seems to exert
a common, and therefore predictable, influence on anion formation.

After studying the effect of alkyl chain length on pyridinium
iodocuprate
structures, we turned our attention to producing a series of ring-substituted
N-butyl pyridinium iodocuprates 8–12. Given that
longer pyridinium alkyl chain complexes 5–7 all
produced the Cu5I7 SBU, we anticipated that
the structures of N-butyl pyridinium cations with small substituents
at the 3-position of the pyridinium ring would prove analogous to
the parent complex 5. If this were the case, the effects
of iodocuprate cluster size, arrangement, and stoichiometry could
be factored out during analysis of the photophysical properties of
complexes 8–12.

Substituted N-butyl pyridinium
iodide salts [N-Bu-3-PyX]I (X =
Cl, Br, I, CN, OMe) were prepared, reacted with CuI, and crystallized
as described above. This resulted in [N-Bu-3-PyX]2{Cu5I7}·nMeCN crystal structures
for all but one of the complexes: 8: X = Cl, n = 1; 9: X = Br, n = 1; 11: X = CN, n = 1; 12: X = OMe, n = 0.5 (see Figures 7, and S23–S31). The crystal
structures of chloro and cyano complexes 8 and 11 were isomorphic. The bromo complex 9 showed
a unit cell that was isomorphic to that of 8 and 11, except with a doubled a-axis cell edge
and doubled formula. This formula doubling was akin to that of the
parent N-butyl pyridinium complex 5. Thus, following
upon the example of 5, all of the ring-substituted analogs,
except that of the iodopyridinium complex 10, showed
a ribbon-cluster iodocuprate structure with extensive C–H···I
interactions. Multiple Cu···Cu interactions of <2.8
Å were also found. In contrast to the non-ring-substituted complex 5, iodocuprate salts 8, 9, 11, and 12 all contained acetonitrile solvent,
and 9 and 12 showed some positional disorder.

structures of 8 (top) and 10 (bottom).
Anion SBU emphasized by ball and stick.

Among the ring-substituted N-butyl pyridinium iodocuprates,
only
the 3-iodo complex 10 was found to have a different formulation:
[N-Bu-3-PyI]2[Cu6I10] (Figures 7, S27, and S28). Two Cu3I5 SBU groups are dimerized
to form a molecular dimer Cu6I104– anion in 10. Interestingly, formation of the Cu6I104– units into chains appears
to be disrupted by the insertion of cations between them. Cation–anion
C–H···I interactions are found at one end of
the inserted cations, and a short I···I (3.56 Å)
between the cation and anion is seen at the other end. Of the five
crystallographically unique iodide centers in the 10 anion,
two each are μ3- and μ2-bridging
and the remaining iodide (I4) is terminal. Related Cu6I104– anions have previously been reported,23 but in contrast to that in 10,
these previous clusters are centered by a Cu2(μ2-I)3, while 10 shows only Cu2I2 rhombs. A copper atom (Cu3A) in 10 is
3-coordinate, the only non-four-coordinate Cu center in the current
study.

Comparing the cation–anion interactions in compounds 8–12, it is noteworthy that all six species show multiple
hydrogen-bonds of the type C–H···I. In each
case except 10, these interactions cross-link the zigzag
iodocuprate ribbon-clusters to form a 2-D sheet. For 10, the chains are disrupted into dimers, although they still lie roughly
in threaded arrangement through the lattice with a spacing of about
6 Å between the units. Looking at the effect of heteroatoms associated
with the cations, the bromine and iodine atoms in 9 and 10 form halogen···halogen interactions with
iodide in the anions. No such interactions are noted with chlorine,
cyano, or methoxy in 8, 11, or 12.

Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
In order to conform
to the structures established above, all samples were recrystallized
before spectroscopic measurements were carried out. The N-butyl pyridinium
complexes 5 and 8–12 were investigated
spectroscopically. The colors of these salts vary, from light yellow
for 5 to dark red for 11, suggesting that
the band gap of these salts is dependent upon the organic cation.
Therefore, UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)
measurements were performed on solid samples. The results are displayed
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 DRS spectra
of 5 and 8–12 at 298
K.

All compounds showed strong absorption
in the visible region, with
absorption falling sharply between 450 and 550 nm. Generally speaking,
the absorption edge shifts to lower energies with increasing electron-withdrawing
character of the pyridinium substituent/aryl group, with the optical
band gap increasing for N-butyl 3-X-pyridinium complexes in the order:
X = CN (1.58 eV), OMe (1.75 eV), Br (1.89 eV), Cl (1.94 eV), I (2.01
eV), and H (2.29 eV). A number of related copper(I) halide compounds
have been reported to undergo a mixed halide-metal to ligand charge
transfer (XMLCT) transition with strong absorption bands between 300
and 500 nm.24−31

Electronic transitions in iodocuprates can originate from
an intermolecular
halide-metal to cation charge transfer XMCCT or a cluster-centered
halide-to-metal charge transfer (XMCT). In the case of an XMCT, absorption
should be independent of cation substitution, a result that is not
consistent with the observed DRS spectra. For XMCCT, pyridinium stabilization
by an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as cyano, would be expected
to decrease the energy difference between the iodocuprate cluster
and pyridinium orbital energy levels. The weak electron-withdrawing
ability of the halide substituents will do little to stabilize the
N-butyl pyridinium ring. With this in mind, we directly observe a
reduction of the absorption edge with increased stabilization of the
N-butyl pyridinium cation in 5 and 8–12 via an increase in substituent electron withdrawing capacity. Given
that an intermolecular charge transfer for these salts is similar
to an XMLCT, and that we observe a clear shift in absorption edge
that varies with cation substitution, it follows that absorption within
this region is the result of an XMCCT.

Luminescence Spectroscopy
Variable temperature photoluminescence
spectra for complexes 5, 8, 9, and 12 were collected to evaluate the effects the
various pyridinium cation substituents had on the photophysical properties.
Compounds 10 and 11 showed no emission between
ambient temperature and 78 K. Among the luminescent complexes, we
observed a clear relationship between the emission properties and
the withdrawing capabilities of the pyridinium ring, indicating that
the luminescence of these compounds can be tuned via careful selection
of the substituent. The luminescence spectra are shown in Figure 9 and summarized in Table 4.

Figure 9 Luminescence spectra
of 5, 8, 9, and 12 between 78 and 298 K (dashed line excitation,
solid lines emission).

Table 4 Summary of 78 K Luminescence Parameters
for 5, 8, 9, and 12
complex	excitation λmax (nm)	emission λmax (nm)	emission λShoulder (nm)	
5	400	546	570	
8	468	556	590	
9	400	558	588	
12	400	540	600	
Under UV excitation at room
temperature, only complex 5 emits weakly in the visible
range. Upon cooling to 78 K, all four
complexes become very bright emitters when irradiated with UV light.
Emission bands for all complexes are very broad between 500 and 700
nm with correspondingly broad excitation bands. The emission bands
are composed of two distinct features: (1) a maximum peak between
540 and 558 nm and (2) a lower energy shoulder between 570 and 600
nm. The emission energy of the shoulder closely follows the trend
for inductive effects: H > Br > Cl > OMe (570, 590, 588,
and 600 nm
respectively), in agreement with the trend seen in the DRS spectra.
Because the iodocuprate clusters are identical among the four complexes,
it follows that the observed emission shoulder is likely the result
of an XMCCT from the iodocuprate cluster to the pyridinium cation.
Evidence of charge transfer can also be seen in the excitation spectra
of 8 and 9 which contain sharp peaks between
450 and 500 nm. These sharp peaks are uncharacteristic of halo- and
pseudohalocuprate complexes, for which excitation spectra are typically
smooth and broad.24,28,30,32 The maximum emission peak energy is independent
of the choice of cation and is relatively unchanged between complexes.
Thus, we assign the remaining maximum emission band to an XMCT within
the iodocuprate cluster.

It is interesting to point out that
the relative intensity of the
shoulder in comparison with the maximum emission intensity is dependent
on the electron-withdrawing ability of the pyridinium substituent
where the ratio of the emission Imax/IShoulder for X = H, Br, Cl, OMe is 1.37, 1.11,
1.28, and 1.10, respectively, further supporting our assignment. In
order to compare the DRS and luminescence behavior of the N-butyl
pyridinium salts to the electronic demand of the cation ring substituents,
the absorption edge energy values and emission wavelengths for the
studied complexes were plotted against the σ Hammett parameter
for the meta ring position (Figure 10). Hammett parameters are linear free-energy relationships
based on ionization constants for various benzoic acid derivatives.33 They have proved to be a very valuable measure
of electron donation and withdrawal behavior for aromatic ring substituents.
Because the amount of data is very limited, the trends in Figure 10 must be treated
with great care, especially the spectroscopic data for which two of
the six compounds studied did not reveal luminescence emission. Nevertheless,
it is apparent that the halogens, methoxy, and cyano substituents,
all of which have positive (electron withdrawing) Hammett parameters,
show reduced absorption edge energy and longer emission wavelengths
than the nonsubstituted N-butyl pyridinium cation. These trends support
electron withdrawal stabilization of the acceptor cation, lessening
the energy gap both for absorption and emission. The methoxy substituent
(complex 12) appears to deviate greatly from the trend
line in both measures, suggesting a possible resonance effect in this
case. It becomes clear that strategic synthetic considerations for
this class of complexes are able to produce desired photophysical
properties such as emission energy and charge transfer efficiency.
On the basis of our observations, this tunability is directly related
to the electron-withdrawing or -donating ability of the cation substituent.

Conclusions
The results presented herein show that
a diverse range of iodocuprate(I)
clusters is produced with N-alkyl pyridinium cations. In several cases,
crystal structure formulations did not match those of the bulk products.
Crystallization of pyridinium and N-alkyl pyridinium ions (RPy+) produced polymeric iodocuprate ions based on Cu(I) tetrahedra
with terminal, μ2-, μ3-, and/or
μ4-iodide centers. No consistent anion SBU was evident
for R = H, Me, Et, and Pr. Pyridinium ions with R = Bu and longer
formed Cu5I72– clusters that
fused together through edge-sharing to produce ribbons. The exception
was for N-butyl 3-iodopyridinium which produced a nonpolymeric Cu6I104– ion. Hydrogen-bonding-like
interactions between C–H (and N–H for pyridinium) and
iodide create longer range networks and potentially offer pathways
for charge transfer in these salts.

The 3-substituted N-butyl
pyridinium iodocuprates all show fairly
distinct optical band gap behavior in the diffuse reflectance spectra.
Electron-withdrawing substituents lower this band gap energy with
the trend: H > I > Cl > Br > OMe > CN. The luminescence-active
parent
N-butyl pyridinium and the 3-chloro-, 3-bromo-, and 3-methoxy substituted
N-butyl pyridinium iodocuprates showed emission bands that indicated
a dominant halide-to-metal charge transfer (XMCT) as well as likely
interion charge transfer wherein substituent inductive effects reflected
the expected energy trend: H > Br > Cl > OMe. The spectroscopic
results
in tandem with the structural studies support the fact that the photophysical
properties of these materials can be tuned through selection of the
cation substituent.

Methods
General
All reagents
were purchased from Aldrich or
Acros. Acetone was dried by distilling from Drierite. Other reagents
and solvents were used as received. Proton NMR spectra were collected
in 5 mm o.d. NMR tubes on a Varian Mercury 400VX NMR spectrometer
operating in the pulse Fourier transform mode. Chemical shifts were
measured with respect to internal solvent. All JHH coupling constants are reported in hertz. NMR spectra of
pyridinium iodide salts are shown in Figures S1–S12 (electronic Supporting Information).

Diffuse reflectance
spectra were collected on solid samples at 298 K. The light source
was a Mikropack DH-2000 deuterium and halogen light source coupled
with an Ocean Optics USB4000 detector. Scattered light was collected
with a fiber optic cable. Spectra were referenced with MgSO4. Data were processed using SpectraSuite 1.4.2_09. Steady-state luminescence
spectra were collected with a QuantaMaster-1046 photoluminescence
spectrometer from Photon Technology International. This device uses
a 75 W xenon arc lamp combined with two excitation monochromators
and one emission monochromator to adjust the bandwidth of light hitting
the sample and detector, respectively. Signal intensity was measured
using a photomultiplier tube. The samples were mounted on a copper
plate using nonemitting copper dust-high vacuum grease. Low-temperature
scans were run on this system coupled to a Janis ST-4 100 optical
cryostat. Liquid nitrogen was used as a coolant.

X-ray Crystallography
Crystals were
grown via ethyl
ether diffusion into a MeCN solution (acetone solution for 1) of the iodocuprate complex. Crystals were mounted on glass fibers.
All measurements were made using graphite-monochromated Mo (1–4 and 6–11) or microfocus Cu
(5 and 12) Kα radiation on a Bruker-AXS
DUO three-circle diffractometer, equipped with an APEX II CCD detector.
Initial space group determination was based on a matrix consisting
of 36 or 120 frames. The data were reduced using SAINT+,15 and empirical absorption correction applied
using SADABS.16 Structures were solved
using intrinsic phasing. Least-squares refinement for all structures
was carried out on F2. The nonhydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed in
riding positions and refined isotropically. Structure solution, refinement,
and the calculation of derived results were performed using the SHELXTL
package of computer programs17 and ShelXle.18
