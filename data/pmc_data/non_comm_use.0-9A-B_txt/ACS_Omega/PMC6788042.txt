Avian influenza virus (AIV) infection,
caused by influenza virus
type A, is an infectious, acute respiratory disease of birds related
to influenza outbreaks worldwide. The highly pathogenic AIV subtype
H5N1 has crossed species barriers to infect mammals, including humans,
with fatal outcomes and has received attention as a potential pandemic
threat. A rapid and timely detection in poultry is vitally important
to prevent the virus spread. Despite their great sensitivity, conventional
detection methods such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction and the agar gel precipitation test are time-consuming
and labor-intensive and require special training. In this work, an
immunowall device was evaluated as an easier and faster way for detecting
AIV H5-hemagglutinin (AIV H5-HA). For detection, fluorescence-labeled
or enzyme-labeled antibody was employed as a labeling antibody in
a sandwich immunoassay. Both were shown in this paper to be easier
and faster assays for detection compared with the conventional enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. In addition, high selectivity was
achieved for AIV H5-HA detection after the evaluation of other different
HA virus subtypes. The limit of detection was 0.23 ng/mL for the enzyme-labeled
antibody. This value was equivalent to that of the conventional ELISA
kit but 8 times faster (31 min compared to 260 min). The detection
range was 0.23–100 ng/mL. The immunowall device with the enzyme-labeled
antibody offers a rapid, sensitive, selective, and simple immunoassay
system for future H5 AIV real sample detection.

==== Body
Introduction
Influenza, also known as “the flu”,
is a contagious,
acute respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. There are three
main types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. Among them, type A influenza
viruses infect a wide variety of avian species and mammals, and type
A is the only type associated with influenza pandemics, making it
the most significant for public health worldwide.1 Influenza virus type A is further divided into subtypes
based on the combinations of different virus surface glycoproteins
hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). So far, 16 HAs (H1–H16)
and 9 NAs (N1–N9) have been identified. The HA subtypes govern
the ability of the virus to bind to and enter cells, where the epidemiologically
most important multiplication of the virus then occurs.2−4

Avian influenza virus (AIV) infection is an infectious disease
of birds that is caused by influenza virus type A. Wild waterfowl,
gulls, and shorebirds are known to be the natural reservoirs of this
virus. Other bird species are also susceptible to being infected with
a wide range of symptoms: from those of a mild illness to a highly
contagious and rapidly fatal disease.5,6 On the basis
of their virulence, influenza A viruses are categorized into two groups:
low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) and highly pathogenic AIV. To date, highly
pathogenic forms have been limited to those of the H5 and H7 subtypes.
When two different viruses infect the same cell, some of their gene
segments are easily exchanged because of the organization of the influenza
virus into eight gene segments.5 Thereby,
LPAIVs can begin to evolve rapidly and can mutate into a highly lethal
version of the same initially mild strain that can kill chickens within
48 h, with the mortality approaching 100%.6−8 Avian H5N1 influenza
in particular has shown a fast mutation and propensity for acquiring
genes from viruses and infecting other animal species.9−11 Globally, between 1997 and 2015, 907 human cases of H5N1 influenza
infection with a 53.3% mortality rate have been reported in 16 countries.12 The increasing incidence of H5N1 influenza in
birds also increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans
and, subsequently, the risk of transmission from person to person.
Quick and timely on-site detection is vitally important to detect
virus outbreaks before the virus has the opportunity to mutate to
the highly pathogenic form.13,14

Laboratory diagnosis
of AIV infection is usually based on established
“gold standard” viral culture and genetic detections
using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Despite their great sensitivity, these methods are time-consuming
and labor-intensive, requiring a week or more for completion, and
they need specially trained workers and facilities.15−22 Other popular methods include antibody-based immunoassays such as
conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).23−28

Currently, on-site disposable detection systems are thought
to
be the best option to prevent infection spread. They offer the advantages
of not requiring sample transport and avoiding exposure to the virus
sources and subsequent equipment decontamination.29 We previously reported a microdevice for immunoassay using
a three-dimensional photopolymer structure (immunowall) fabricated
in a microchannel, called the immunowall device. The immunowall device
provides a fast, easy, and highly sensitive detection of disease biomarkers.30−32 In the immunowall device, a biotinylated capture antibody is immobilized
on the wall structure surface through biotin–streptavidin (SA)
interaction. Introducing an analyte and secondary and labeled antibodies
produces a sandwich complex anchored on the sides of the wall. To
improve the sensitivity, an enzyme label was used, and the signal
was amplified by the enzymatic reaction with a fluorogenic substrate.32

In this work, we carried out the detection
of H5-HA from AIV using
the immunowall device. A comparison between fluorescence-labeled and
enzyme-labeled antibodies was made to achieve a highly sensitive detection.
The performance was contrasted with that of a conventional ELISA kit.
Also, the selectivity was evaluated for different HA proteins: H1,
H3, H5, and H7.

Experimental Section

photopolymer (AWP, 6%) was purchased from Toyo Gosei Co., Ltd. (Tokyo,
Japan). SA was purchased from ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd. (East Brunswick,
NJ). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), skim milk powder, hydrochloric acid,

Fabrication of the Immunowall Device
Figure 1 shows a photograph and schematic
representation of a microchip and the evaluated immunowall device.
The microchip was fabricated by Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. (Tokyo,
Japan) from a cyclic olefin copolymer and had 40 microchannels. The
immunowall had a width of 40 μm and was fabricated inside a
microchannel using a mixture of a water-soluble photopolymer (AWP)
and SA by photolithography, in accordance with the literature.32 The AWP/SA ratio was 5:5 for the assay with
DyLight 650-labeled antibody and 7:3 for that with the alkaline phosphatase-labeled
antibody; in both, the final concentration of SA was 5 mg/mL. The
fabrication process is briefly described. First, the microchip and
the photomask were aligned into a homemade holder. After this, the
microchannel was filled with a mixture of AWP and SA (0.25 μL)
by using a pipette (PIPETMAN; Gilson S.A.S.; Villiers le Bel, France).
Then, UV light (320 nm, 20 mW) from a mercury lamp (LA-410UV; Hayashi
Watch Works; Tokyo, Japan) was irradiated for 8 s. Finally, the uncured
mixture was removed by a vacuum pump (SP 20; Air Liquide Medical Systems;
Paris, France), and the immunowall was washed 10 times with a washing
buffer (PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 and 0.5% BSA).

using a mixture of a water-soluble photopolymer (AWP) and SA. The
AWP/SA ratio was 5:5 for the fluorescence-labeled antibody and 7:3
for the enzyme-labeled antibody.

Capture Antibody Biotinylation Process
Mouse anti-H5N1
HA monoclonal antibody was biotinylated following the procedure described
in the biotin-labeling kit-NH2 with minor modifications.
Briefly, 25 μg of the antibody solution and 100 μL of
WS buffer (contained in the kit) were added to a filtration tube by
pipetting and mixed. Then, this mixture was centrifuged at 10 000
rpm for 10 min. Next, 100 μL of the reaction buffer (contained
in the kit) and 8 μL of the NH2-reactive biotin solution
(contained in the kit) in dimethyl sulfoxide were added to the filtration
tube by pipetting and were mixed. The mixture was incubated at 37
°C for 10 min. After incubation, 100 μL of the WS buffer was added to the filtration tube,
and the mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. Finally,
the conjugate was recovered by adding 200 μL of the WS buffer.
The resulting solution was transferred to a sealable microtube and
stored at 4 °C until used.

Assay Procedure
The volume of each solution injected
into a microchannel was 0.25 μL. First, a concentration of 50
μg/mL of biotinylated mouse anti-H5N1 HA monoclonal antibody
(capture antibody) in PBS containing 0.5% of BSA (0.5% BSA–PBS)
was injected into a microchannel and incubated for 1 h. Next, a standard
of recombinant H5-HA protein in PBS was added with an incubation time
of 15 min. Then, 1% of skim milk in PBS (blocking solution) was added
and incubated for 5 min (this step is only required when the alkaline
phosphatase-labeled antibody is employed). This blocking process avoided
the nonspecific adsorption of the detection and labeling antibody
on the immunowall surface. Subsequently, anti-AIV H5-HA antibody (detection
antibody) (50 μg/mL) in 0.5% BSA–PBS was injected and
incubated for 30 s. Finally, DyLight 650-labeled antibody or alkaline
phosphatase-labeled antibody (labeling antibody) (50 μg/mL)
in 0.5% BSA–PBS was injected and incubated for 30 s. After
each incubation at room temperature and humidity conditions, the solution
was removed by a vacuum pump, and the immunowall was washed five times
with a washing buffer. The last washing buffer injection was not removed
from the microchannel.

For the experiments with the alkaline
phosphatase-labeled antibody, an extra step was required: the immunowall
device was placed on a fluorescence microscope stage, and 30 μM
of the fluorogenic substrate (DDAO phosphate) in Tris-HCl buffer (pH
8.0, 1 μM Mg2+) was injected into the microchannel.
The enzymatic reaction was carried out in the dark at room temperature
for 30 min.

Image Capture and Analysis
The immunowall
device was
placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000;
Keyence; Tokyo, Japan) with a filter cube Cy5 filter (OP-87766; excitation
620/60 nm, emission 700/75 nm; Keyence; Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence
images were taken at 10, 20, and 30 min for alkaline phosphatase-labeled
antibody assay (CCD camera exposure time was 0.5 s) and without any
time interval for DyLight 650-labeled antibody assay (CCD camera exposure
time was 7 s). For each standard, the assay was performed in triplicate.

The fluorescence intensity of the captured images was measured
through ImageJ software. Figure 2 shows typical fluorescence images. The detection area,
20 pixels × 1000 pixels or 100 pixels × 1000 pixels, was
adjusted manually depending on the assay (red dotted line in Figure 2).

Results and Discussion
H5-HA
Detection with Fluorescence-Labeled Antibody
The conventional
immunowall method30 was
employed to prepare a calibration curve for the H5-HA standard in
PBS with the DyLight 650-labeled antibody for a concentration range
between 1 and 100 ng/mL (Figure 3). In this case, the fluorescence-labeled antibody
was immobilized on both sides of the immunowall, where fluorescence
was shown (Figure 2a). The limit of detection (LOD), 10.7 ng/mL, was determined considering
the average of the blank signal plus 3 standard deviations. Thus,
the detection range of H5-HA was from 10.7 to 100 ng/mL, with a total
incubation time of 16 min. This detection method is known to be faster
but not as sensitive as the conventional one. Therefore, the signal
amplification with the enzyme-labeled antibody was tested in the next
experiment to achieve higher sensitivity.

the standard of AIV H5-HA PBS with a fluorescence-labeled
antibody. The detection range was 10.7–100 ng/mL. The dotted
line represents the LOD (blank average plus 3 standard deviations).
Exposure time of the CCD camera was 7 s.

H5-HA Detection with Enzyme-Labeled Antibody
In this
analysis mode, fluorescent molecules were generated by an enzymatic
reaction in the presence of an excess amount of substrate (DDAO phosphate).
The diffusion of the fluorescent enzymatic product (DDAO) into the
immunowall induced fluorescence in the entire wall area (Figure 2b). Our previous
research has suggested that DDAO molecules could be accumulated inside
the wall and could efficiently magnify the fluorescence intensity.32 First, a standard solution of H5-HA in PBS (20
ng/mL) was used as a model to probe the fluorescence intensity variation
during 30 min. It was found that the fluorescence intensity considerably
increased as a function of time (Figure 4a), and the value of the signal/blank ratio
(S/B) because of the DDAO accumulation inside the immunowall was slightly
improved.

Figure 4 Fluorescence intensity measured with an alkaline phosphate-labeled
antibody. (a) Fluorescence intensity of a standard of H5-HA in PBS
(20 ng/mL) as a function of time. (b) Calibration curves for the standards
of AIV H5-HA in PBS of H5-HA with an enzyme-labeled antibody at three
different times (10, 20, and 30 min). Detection range was 0.23–100
ng/mL. The dotted lines represent the LOD (blank average plus 3 standard
deviations). Exposure time of the CCD camera was 0.5 s.

Different solutions of the H5-HA standard in PBS (concentration
range 0.1–100 ng/mL) were measured with the alkaline phosphatase-labeled
antibody and the DDAO phosphate substrate. The resulting calibration
curves are shown in Figure 4b. Although the fluorescent intensity increased over time,
the behavior of the calibration curves was the same. The LODs, calculated
by considering the average of the blank plus 3 standard deviations,
were 0.23 ng/mL (at the 10 min measurement), 0.31 ng/mL (20 min),
and 0.33 ng/mL (30 min). These values did not differ much between
themselves, but they were much lower than that obtained for the device
with the fluorescence-labeled antibody. Thus, an enzymatic reaction
time of 10 min was selected as the optimum time for the subsequent
selectivity experiments. The detection range was from 0.23 to 100
ng/mL, with a total incubation time of 31 min.

Table 1 summarizes
the results for both the immunowall device analysis mode and the conventional
microtiter plate method.30 The conventional
ELISA kit offered the lowest value of LOD (0.08 ng/mL) but had the
longest analysis time (260 min). Immunowall devices had the advantages
of requiring a very small volume of sample (only 0.25 μL) and
a shorter assay time. The fluorescence-labeled antibody presented
a rapid way for H5-HA detection in only 16 min, with an LOD value
of 10.7 ng/mL. The enzyme-labeled antibody increased the sensitivity
(LOD 0.23 ng/mL) while keeping the short assay time (31 min). The
comparison of LOD values between the immunowall device with the alkaline
phosphatase-labeled antibody and the microtiter plate method showed
that the sensitivity was equivalent. However, the time required for
the former analysis was 8 times less. As mentioned before, the rapid
and timely detection of AIV H5-HA is needed for stopping the spread
and the mutation of this virus into its highly pathogenic form. Thus,
the immunowall device with an enzyme-labeled antibody is a good option
for future rapid and sensitive detection using a very low volume of
sample.

Selectivity Experiments
The selectivity experiments
were carried out with four types of HA proteins H1, H3, H5, and H7
in the immunowall device with fluorescence-labeled and enzyme-labeled
antibodies. Solutions of each standard at 100 ng/mL in PBS (fluorescence-labeled
antibody) and 20 ng/mL in PBS (enzyme-labeled antibody) were tested
and compared against a blank signal. The normalized values of fluorescence
intensity were calculated considering the average of the H5-HA signal
as 1. The results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Normalized values of fluorescence intensity for different
HA subtypes
(H1, H3, H5, H7) measured with the immunowall device using fluorescence-labeled
and enzyme-labeled antibodies.

Among the different HA protein subtypes, H5-HA was the only one
that presented a significantly different signal to the blank. From
these results, it was concluded that the immunowall device with an
enzyme-labeled antibody is a promising option for future AIV H5-HA
virus detection.

Conclusions
In this work, AIV H5-HA
detection using the immunowall device was
optimized. Fluorescence-labeled antibody and enzyme-labeled antibody
were used as labeling antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody
with DDAO phosphate as the fluorogenic substrate showed an increase
in sensitivity because of enzymatic amplification. The LOD of the
H5-HA solution in PBS was 0.23 ng/mL (almost 50 times lower than that
of the fluorescence-labeled antibody), and the detection range was
0.23–100 ng/mL. Only 31 min were required as analysis time
with a small volume of sample (0.25 μL). Also, the high selectivity
of the optimized method was proved against other subtypes of AIV HAs.
The immunowall device with the enzyme-labeled antibody offers a rapid,
sensitive, selective, and simple immunoassay system for H5 AIV detection.

Future tasks involve testing to detect H5 AIV from real samples
of chickens and other kinds of poultry with the presented methodology.
Additionally, the evaluation of the sensitivity of this device with
real samples needs to be examined. As a short-term goal, the development
of a miniaturized detection system with the immunowall device for
on-site detection will be pursued.
