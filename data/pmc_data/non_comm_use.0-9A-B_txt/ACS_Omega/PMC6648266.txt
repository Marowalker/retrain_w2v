Human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2) is overexpressed
in nearly 20–30% of breast cancers and is associated with metastasis
resulting in poor patient survival and high recurrence. The dual EGFR/HER2
kinase inhibitor lapatinib has shown promising clinical results, but
its limitations have also led to the resistance and activation of
tumor survival pathways. Following our previous investigation of quinones
as HER2 kinase inhibitors, we synthesized several naphthoquinone derivatives
that significantly inhibited breast tumor cells expressing HER2 and
trastuzumab-resistant HER2 oncogenic isoform, HER2Δ16. Two of
these compounds were shown to be more effective than lapatinib at
the inhibition of HER2 autophosphorylation of Y1248. Compounds 7 (5,8-dihydroxy-2-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione) and 9 (2-(bromomethyl)-5,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-1,4-dione) inhibited
HER2-expressing MCF-7 cells (IC50 0.29 and 1.76 μM,
respectively) and HER2Δ16-expressing MCF-7 cells (IC50 0.51 and 1.76 μM, respectively). Compound 7 was
also shown to promote cell death in multiple refractory breast cancer
cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.12 to 2.92 μM.
These compounds can function as lead compounds for the design of a
new series of nonquinonoid structural compounds that can maintain
a similar inhibition profile.

==== Body
Introduction
Breast
cancer (BC) is the second-most common cause of cancer-related
deaths in women with ∼40 000 deaths per year in the
United States.1 Of the BC patients, 20–30%
have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressed
BC, which has been shown to result in poor prognosis with high recurrence
and decreased overall survival rates.2 In
2006, FDA approved the clinical use of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody
that targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor, which
dramatically improved the survival rate for patients with HER2-positive
BC.3,4 The initial treatment strategy for HER2-positive
breast cancer typically consists of trastuzumab (an IgG1-class monoclonal
antibody),5−8 in combination with chemotherapy,3,9 or lapatinib
(a small molecule EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitor).10−12 Trastuzumab
was shown to increase the overall patient survival and progression-free
survival and showed higher response rates when used in conjunction
with chemotherapy.13−16 However, despite the efficacy of trastuzumab, acquired or intrinsic
resistance remains a major clinical issue and has been evidenced to
occur within a year of treatment.17−19 There are several implicating
factors responsible for trastuzumab resistance. Among them, a common
phenomenon found in HER2-positive breast cancer is the presence of
a truncated HER2 (p95HER2), which has shed its extracellular domain
while retaining active kinase functionality.20 Additionally, an oncogenic isoform of HER2 containing an in-frame
deletion of exon 16 (HER2Δ16) was shown to enhance transformation
activity over wild-type HER2, leading to node-positive breast cancer
and trastuzumab resistance.21,22 Further, HER2Δ16
was shown to promote estrogen-independent growth in ERα-positive
breast tumor cells and induced tamoxifen resistance through multiple
mechanisms including the upregulation of BCL-2 through miR-15a/16
suppression.23

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
may be more effective in treating HER2-positive
breast cancer, due to their ability to block downstream-signaling
pathways in p95HER2, HER2Δ16, and full-length HER2. Treatment
with lapatinib was shown to delay tumor progression by 4 months as
a single-agent treatment and 8 months when used in conjunction with
chemotherapy in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.24 However, lapatinib has its limitations, and resistance
remains a major challenge.25 One of the
primary mechanisms linked to lapatinib resistance is an ER-dependent
survival pathway occurring as a result of the upregulation of ER signaling
and the parallel upregulation of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein.26

We previously demonstrated that analogs
of the natural product
emodin could be used as HER2 kinase inhibitors.27,28 To further explore and optimize the structure–activity relationships,
we designed and synthesized several quinone compounds that were highly
effective at growth inhibition of HER2 and HER2Δ16 overexpressed
in MCF-7 breast tumor cells. Western blot assays were performed on
these compounds to determine their effectiveness in the inhibition
of autophosphorylation of Y1248. Additionally, the most potent inhibitor
was subjected to high-throughput assays in multiple breast cancer
cell lines expressed in triple-negative breast cancer, as well as
trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant cells. Many of the tyrosine kinase
inhibitors being investigated as EGFR or HER2 inhibitors contain N-heterocyclic
scaffolds, such as pyrimidoazepines, anilinoquinazolines, pyrrolotriazinamines,
and pyrrolopyrimidines.27 To our knowledge,
these are the first naphthoquinones to be used as kinase inhibitors
in HER2-associated breast cancer. Herein, we report the synthesis
of some naphthoquinone compounds as breast cancer growth inhibitors
and their efficacy studies. In our future work, the structural features
of these compounds will be used to design a new series of molecules
that can potentially exhibit similar breast cancer growth inhibition
properties.

Results and Discussion
Our earlier work28 on the identification
of lead compounds as growth inhibitors of the trastuzumab-resistant
MCF-7/HER2Δ16 cell lines gave us three effective compounds.
All of them were mono/dihydroxynaphthoquinone derivatives 1–3 (Figure 1).

breast
cancer cell line reported earlier.

Chemistry
In continuation of our search for newer derivatives
with increased potency, we embarked on the synthesis of 5,8-dihydronaphthoquinone
derivatives substituted at the 2, 3, 6, and 7 positions. Four different
schemes were employed for this purpose. Scheme 1 involved the double Friedel–Crafts
acylation reaction using substituted maleic anhydrides and/or substituted
1,4-dimethoxybenzene in the presence of aluminum chloride and sodium
chloride at high temperatures followed by demethylation with HCl at
0 °C (25–55% yield). With a methyl substitution on both
of the reactants 8a and 8b, isomeric mixtures
of products were obtained as an inseparable mixture. With the use
of visible light initiation (120 W flood lamps), free radical halogenation
of compound 6 using N-bromosuccinimide
(NBS) gave the brominated side-chain compound 9(29) in 32% yield.

Acylation Reaction
Reagents and conditions: (a)
NaCl, AlCl3; (b) HCl, 180–200 °C; (c) N-bromosuccinimide, azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), CCl4.

The second synthetic route made
use of the established reaction
sequence for generating 1,4,5,8-tetramethoxy-2-naphthaldehyde from
1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene 12 (Scheme 2). Compounds 14–17 were prepared using reported methods.30 The preparation of ethyl (E)-3-(5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-dioxo-1,4-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)acrylate 20 was achieved through a three-step process involving the
Wittig reaction of 2-formyl-1,4,5,8-tetramethoxynaphthalene 12 and ethyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate in dichloromethane
(DCM) at room temperature. The phosphonium ylide was prepared through
the nucleophilic substitution of ethyl 2-bromoacetate with triphenylphosphine
under refluxing conditions in toluene. The precipitated phosphonium
bromide salt was filtered and then deprotonated with sodium hydroxide
to afford ethyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate. The obtained
Wittig product ethyl (E)-3-(1,4,5,8-tetramethoxynaphthalen-2-yl)acrylate 18 was then oxidized using aqueous ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate
at room temperature, which afforded a mixture of isomers that were
easily separated through silica gel chromatography and showed distinct
chemical shifts in proton NMR. Demethylation of ethyl (E)-3-(5,8-dimethoxy-1,4-dioxo-1,4-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)acrylate
was achieved through a boron tribromide adduct, which was hydrolyzed
by the addition of water to afford product 20 (41% yield
from 12). The photooxidation method31 was used to prepare 5-hydroxynaphthalene-1,4-dione (juglone) 11 from 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene by bubbling molecular oxygen
in methanol in the presence of Rose Bengal catalyst and green light-emitting
diode (LED).

1,4-benzoquinone, with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid
in chloroform for 48 h followed by purification using silica gel chromatography.32

5-hydroxy-7-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione 25 was prepared

using 3-methyl-1-methoxy-1-trimethylsiloxy-1,4-diene and 1,4-benzoquinone
as a dienophile at 0 °C for 20 h (Scheme 4). The resulting 7-methyl 5-(trimethylsiloxy)naphthalene-1,4-dione
adduct was hydrolyzed using 1 N hydrochloric acid in methanol to afford
product 25.33 Compound 5-methoxy-7-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione 27 was obtained by refluxing 25 in silver(II)
oxide with iodomethane followed by filtration over celite and flash
chromatography.33 Side-chain bromination
of compound 25 to form compound 26 was accomplished
using NBS in the presence of the radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN) in carbon tetrachloride under refluxing conditions.

Our laboratory is also working on a class of phthalimides
as cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors (unpublished work). Some of the commercially available
compounds were purchased and tested for their growth inhibition ability
of the MCF-7/HER2 and MCF-7/HER2Δ16 cell lines (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Structures of the phthalimide
derivatives that were tested for
the growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells.

Growth Inhibition of HER2- and HER2Δ16-Overexpressed MCF-7
Breast Cancer Cell Lines
The naphthoquinone series of compounds
that were synthesized in our laboratory and the phthalimide compounds
purchased from Timtec Chemicals were initially subjected to high-throughput
screening against the MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines expressing HER2,
HER2Δ16, and empty vector. Lapatinib was used as positive control.
The cells were treated with the compounds at 10 μM concentration
for 48 h. After treatment, cell viability was tested using the CellTiter-Glo
Assay (Promega). Out of a total of 24 compounds, 5 compounds suppressed
cell viability potently in all three cell lines. After 48 h, these
five compounds decreased cell viability by >90% when compared to
lapatinib
with a cell viability of <70% at the same concentration. Eight
compounds showed moderate suppression of cell viability with many
of them showing a greater inhibition of the MCF-7-HER2 cell line than
that of the MCF-7-HER2Δ16 cell line in a pattern that was similar
to that of lapatinib (Figure 3). The six best compounds 7, 9,
the mixture of 8a + 8b, 25,
and 27 were then taken up for further studies.

Figure 3 Cell viability
after 48 h treatment of each compound at a concentration
of 10 μM.

The IC50 values
of the six best compounds from the high-throughput
screening were measured by treating each of the cell lines with different
drug concentrations for 48 h followed by the CellTiter-Glo Assay to
detect cell viability (Table 1). Lapatinib, a known HER2/EGFR inhibitor in clinical use,
was taken as the positive standard. Lapatinib inhibited the three
cell lines MCF-7/pcDNA, MCF-7/HER2, and MCF-7/HER2Δ16 with IC50 values of 15.71, 15.79, and 19.22 μM. Other than compound 25, most of our compounds (7, 9,
the mixture of 8a + 8b, and 27) showed higher potency of inhibition of the three breast cancer
cell lines than lapatinib. The dose–response curves for the
three compounds 7, the mixture of 8a + 8b, and 9 with the lowest IC50 values
for MCF-7/pcDNA (0.32, 1.28, and 1.66 μM), MCF-7/HER2 (0.29,
1.30, and 1.78 μM), and MCF-7/HER2Δ16 (0.51, 0.51, and
3.61 μM) are represented in Figure 4. Compound 7 showed the best
inhibition potency for all three cell lines.

HER2 is a member of the erbB family of tyrosine kinases,
which
is composed of four partial homologous transmembrane receptors: EGFR/HER1
(erbB1), HER2 (erbB2/neu), HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4). With the
exception of HER2, these receptors exhibit ligand specificity. Ligand
binding induces homo- or heterodimerization through a disulfide bond
linkage and leads to receptor activation and tyrosine autophosphorylation.
HER2 is a preferred dimerization partner due to its high catalytic
activity and forms potent heterodimers with EGFR and HER3.34 HER2 with its intrinsic kinase activity can
transphosphorylate other members of the erbB family. HER2 and HERΔ16
are overexpressed in the breast cancer cell lines that have been used
in this study, leading to the kinases being constitutively active.
Upon dimerization, the constitutively active HER2 and HER2Δ16
receptors can transphosphorylate coexpressed EGFR. The levels of phosphorylated
HER2 in the parental MCF-7 cell line were less, resulting in its lack
of dimerization with EGFR and its transphosphorylation. Western blots
were performed to determine the ability of the compounds to inhibit
the activation of the HER2 receptor (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Western blot analysis of autophosphorylation
at the HER2 residue
Y1284. Compounds 6, 7, (8a + 8b) and 9 inhibit the phosphorylation at HER2-Y1284
in MCF7/pcDNA, MCF/HER2 and MCF7/HER216. Compounds 12, 25, 26 and 27 did not show
notable inhibition of phosphorylation at HER2-Y1284 even though they
showed notable inhibition in the high-throughput assay. Compound 28, which did not show notable inhibition in the high-throughput
assay, shows significant phosphorylation at HER2-Y1284 in all of the
three cell lines.

The total and phosphorylated
protein were detected upon the treatment
of each of the cell lines with compounds 6, 7, 8a + 8b, 9, 12, 25, 26, 27, and 28 along with the positive control lapatinib at 10 μM concentration
for 2 h. Compound 28 did not show notable growth inhibition
in the high-throughput assay and was used as a negative control. Compounds 6, 7, 8a + 8b, and 9 significantly decreased HER2-activating phosphorylation
to the same extent as lapatinib at the autophosphorylation site Y1284.
Compounds 12, 25, 26, and 27 did not show such an effect on autophosphorylation. The
ability of these compounds to inhibit the breast cancer cell lines
and not the HER2 autophosphorylation at Y1284 indicates that the mechanism
of growth inhibition in cancer cells might involve some other alternate
pathways. Compounds 6, 7, 8a + 8b, and 9 that showed a decreased autophosphorylation
in HER2 were then tested for the ability to decrease the transphosphorylation
of the EGFR receptor at the residue Y1068 (Figure 6). Compounds 26 and 28 were used as negative controls. The transphosphorylation at Y1068
of EGFR receptor was decreased by compounds 6, 7, 8a + 8b, and 9 in
levels comparable to that of lapatinib.

Figure 6 Western blot analysis
of autophosphorylation at the EGFR residue
Y1068. Compounds 6, 7, (8a + 8b), and 9 inhibit the phosphorylation at EGFR-Y1068
in MCF-7/pcDNA, MCF/HER2, and MCF-7/HER216. Compound 26 did not show notable inhibition of phosphorylation at EGFR-Y1069
even though it showed a notable inhibition in the high-throughput
assay. Compound 28, which did not show a notable inhibition
in the high-throughput assay, shows significant phosphorylation at
EGFR-Y1068 in all of the three cell lines.

Compound 7 was taken up for further analysis
of its
ability to inhibit the growth of a panel of breast cancer cell lines
of varied types. The panel included the triple-negative cell lines
BT20, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231, the trastuzumab-sensitive cell lines
SKBR3 and BT474, and the trastuzumab-resistant cell lines SUM 190PT
and SUM 225CWN (Figure 7). Compound 7 inhibited the growth of these breast cancer
cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.1231 to 2.923
μM. The potency of inhibition was comparable for most of the
cell lines that were tested except for MDA-MB-231 where a 3- to 4-fold
decrease in potency was evidenced.

Figure 7 Inhibition of various breast cancer cell
lines by compound 7.

Compound 7 was then subjected to a cross kinase
panel
high-throughput assay at 10 μM concentration, at Life Technologies,
to determine the selectivity of kinase inhibition. A panel of 100
disease-relevant kinases (assay performed by Thermo Fisher Scientific’s
SelectScreen Profiling Service) was studied (see the Supporting Information). Kinases (11) were inhibited at 80%
or more, protein kinase B 1/2 (also known as AKT1/2), Aurora kinases
A/B (AurK A/B), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), feline sarcoma kinase,
fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGFR1), I kappa B kinase B/E (IKK B/E),
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1), mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase kinase 8 (MAP3K8), never in mitosis (NIMA)-related
kinase 2 (NEK2), polo-like kinase 1/3 (PLK1/3), serum/glucocorticoid-regulated
kinase 1 (SGK1), and TEK tyrosine kinase. All of these kinases except
for CHEK2 are reported to have tumorigenic roles in breast cancer.35−42

Docking studies were performed on the active compounds with
the
HER2 X-ray crystal structure 3RCD.pdb,43 using the molecular
operating environment software’s docking module. The binding
pocket of the HER2 protein is L-shaped with two large cavities that
are connected to each other. The cavity where the base of the ATP
molecule binds to the hinge region has a width of ∼13.11 Å
and a height of 8.30 Å. The second cavity behind the first cavity
has the invariant Lys753 and Asp853 residues outlining it with a width
of 22.13 Å and a height of 9.20 Å. Compound 7 is a planar molecule with the dimensions 8.07 Å × 6.63
Å. Docking studies of this compound revealed that it preferred
to reside in the second cavity where it made more hydrogen bonds with
the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr862, the backbone −NH of
Asp863, and the backbone carbonyl of Leu796. The side-chain methyl
group of compound 7 depicted hydrophobic interactions
with the side chain of Leu852 and the side-chain methyl group of Thr862.
On the other hand, compound 3 with one less phenolic
group preferred to reside in the first cavity. The additional hydrogen
bonds made by compound 7 might have contributed to its
greater efficacy in the growth inhibition of the breast cancer cell
lines MCF-7/HER2 and MCF-7/HER2Δ16 (Figure 8).

Conclusions
Our search for new inhibitors that can
have good efficacy against
HER2Δ16- and HER2-overexpressed breast cancer cell lines has
yielded several compounds with sub-micromolar growth inhibition potency.
The compounds with greater growth inhibition profile also showed HER2
autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation repression. Some of the
compounds that showed potential for growth inhibition of the HER2Δ16-
and HER2-overexpressed breast cancer cell lines did not exhibit inhibiting
effects on the HER2 autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation.
One can safely conclude that these agents might be affecting the growth
inhibition of these breast cancer cell lines through other mechanisms.
Additionally, we found that the most effective compound showed good
growth inhibition potency for several types of breast cancer cell
lines with an IC50 range of 0.1231–2.923 μM.
These results demonstrate the ability of these compounds to effectively
inhibit the growth of refractory breast cancer cells. This could be
due to the inhibition of several key kinases that play a detrimental
role in cancer. With several of the highly selective kinase inhibitors
in clinical settings as breast cancer therapeutics leading to the
development of resistance within a year,44−47 the thought arises whether the
inhibition of more than one key tumorigenic kinase would be the path
to take for achieving success in the fight against aggressive and
refractory breast cancer. Such an approach will also require better
success at the targeted delivery of these agents to minimize any side
effects due to multiple kinase targeting. The problems with the quinone
structural moiety are recognized for issues on redox cycling and chelating.
The future research work will involve mitigating these issues by modifying
the quinone ring and designing a new series of compounds that are
structurally acceptable therapeutic series. The goal will be to maintain
similar breast cancer growth inhibition profile and improved kinase
inhibition profile as compound 7.

Experimental Section
Synthetic
Materials and Methods
All reagents were used
as received from the manufacturer, with the exception of NBS, which
was recrystallized from water and allowed to dry before use. All NMR
spectra were recorded on a Agilent 400 MHz using tetramethylsilane
as an internal solvent reference. Aluminum-backed 60F254 silica plates
were used for thin-layer chromatography. Flash chromatography was
performed using the Teledyne Isco CombiFlash automated column machine
using ethyl acetate and hexane as the mobile solvents. Melting points
were obtained from a Mel-Temp melting point apparatus. High-resolution
MS was performed at the University of Texas at Austin on the Micromass
Autospec Ultima, giving high-resolution chemical ionization.

Cell Culture
Generation of MCF-7/pcDNA3,
MCF-7/HER2,
and MCF-7/HER2Δ16 cell lines has been described previously.51 All MCF-7 cell lines were cultured according
to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) recommendations. The
human breast cancer cell lines BT20, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3,
and BT474 were purchased from ATCC and cultured according to their
instructions. The SUM 190PT and SUM 225CWN cell lines were procured
from Asterand Bioscience and cultured according to their protocol.

Cell Viability Assay
Cell lines were plated in duplicate
wells using a white 96-well plate (VWR) at 3000 cells per well. After
24 h, the cells were treated with the listed drug concentrations for
48 h. The plates were then assayed for cell viability using the CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Luminescence was recorded using a Victor X3 Multilabel
Plate Reader (PerkinElmer).

Protein Extraction and Western Blot
MCF-7 cell lines
were plated at 3 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well
plate and cultured for 48 h followed by a 10 μM drug treatment
for 2 h. Cells were lysed using a 50 μL radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer (10 mM NaPO4, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
0.1% SDS, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P40) per well. Lysates were
collected and protein concentrations were measured by a plate reader
using a Coomassie Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Samples were
then combined with a 4× LDS loading buffer (Thermo Fisher) and
DTT (Thermo Fisher) and then boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. Sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by
loading 30 μg of protein sample onto a NuPAGE 4–12% gradient
Bis–Tris gel (Thermo Fisher). Samples were transferred to a
PVDF Immobilon-FL membrane (Millipore) using a trans-blot semidry
electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) and blocked for 1 h using
5% BSA in TBST (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). Membranes
were probed with the following antibodies overnight: c-ERBB-2 AB8
e2-4001 (MS-325, Neomarkers), HER2-Y1248 (ab47755, Abcam), EGFR D38B1
(4267, Cell Signaling), EGFR-Y1068 (ab5644, Abcam), or α-tubulin
(05-829, Millipore). All washes were performed using TBST. After incubation
with IR dye-conjugated secondary antibodies goat antirabbit 680RD
(926-68071, Li-Cor) and goat antimouse 800CW (926-32210, Li-Cor),
membranes were scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor
Biosciences).
