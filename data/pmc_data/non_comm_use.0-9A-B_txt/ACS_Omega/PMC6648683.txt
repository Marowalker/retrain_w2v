Manipulating the
atomic structure of semiconductors is a fine way
to tune their properties. The rationalization of their modified properties
is, however, particularly challenging as defects locally disrupt the
long-range structural ordering, and a deeper effort is required to
fully describe their structure. In this work, we investigated the
photoelectrochemical properties of an anatase-type structure featuring
a high content of titanium vacancies stabilized by dual-oxide substitution
by fluoride and hydroxide anions. Such atomic modification induces
a slight red-shift band gap energy of 0.08 eV as compared to pure
TiO2, which was assigned to changes in titanium–anion
ionocovalent bonding. Under illumination, electron paramagnetic resonance
spectroscopy revealed the formation of TiIII and O2– radicals which were not detected in defect-free
TiO2. Consequently, the modified anatase shows higher ability
to oxidize water with lower electron–hole recombination rate.
To further increase the photoelectrochemical properties, we subsequently
modified the compound by a surface functionalization with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). This treatment further modifies
the chemical composition, which results in a red shift of the band
gap energy to 3.03 eV. Moreover, the interaction of the NMP electron-donating
molecules with the surface induces an absorption band in the visible
region with an estimated band gap energy of 2.25–2.50 eV. Under
illumination, the resulting core–shell structure produces a
high concentration of reduced TiIII and O2–, suggesting an effective charge carrier separation
which is confirmed by high photoelectrochemical properties. This work
provides new opportunities to better understand the structural features
that affect the photogenerated charge carriers.

1 Introduction
Owing
to its semiconductor character enabling light-induced productions
of charge carriers, titanium dioxide has been largely investigated.1 In particular, the pioneering work of Fujishima
and Honda on water splitting2 led to intensive
research on photoelectrochemical systems using TiO2 including
photoelectrochemical water splitting, photocatalysis, and dye-sensitized
solar cells.3 However, current limitations
of (anatase) TiO2 are a limited light absorption due to
a band gap energy of 3.2 eV yielding an absorption of less than 5%
of the incident solar radiation and a rapid recombination of electrons
and holes produced upon photoexcitation.4,5

Enabling
the practical uses of TiO2 as photoelectrodes
requires a concomitant red-shift light adsorption into the visible
light range and an improved charge separation upon photoexcitation.
This can be achieved by using different strategies including surface
engineering and/or doping/substitution with heteroatoms.1,6,7 In the latter strategy, metallic
and nonmetallic dopants can produce donor/acceptor states in the band
gap of TiO2 to effectively extend the light adsorption
into the visible light range.8,9 Cationic metal dopants,
however, produce localized d states deep in the band gap of TiO2 and create new recombination centers for electrons and holes.9

Among all anionic dopants, fluoride is
unique because it can act
as both a morphology director and electron scavenger to reduce the
recombination rate of charge carriers.9−15 There is, however, no clear understanding on how fluorine doping
affects the band gap energy and the photoactivity of anatase TiO2.12,14−17 Czoska et al.15 reported that fluorine doping of TiO2 did not
show a red shift in the visible light region nor reacted with absorbed
O2 to form superoxide radicals. Li et al.16 demonstrated that fluorine doping did not produce any effect
on the optical absorption of TiO2, although a high visible
photocatalytic activity was achieved because of the creation of surface
oxygen vacancies. On the contrary, Calatayud et al.14 reported that lattice fluorine doping enabled a 0.2 eV
decrease of the band gap energy. Yu et al.12 previously reported that the F-doped TiO2 showed stronger
absorption in the UV–visible range and a red shift. Overall,
such discrepancies might come from the nature of defects induced by
the partial substitution of O2– by F–. For instance, the stabilization of fluorine through a mechanism
of valence induction,14 that is, TiIV(1–x)TiIIIxO(2–x)Fx, yielded a 0.2 eV decrease of the
band gap energy. In this substitutional mechanism, the presence of
TiIII centers is suggested to be the physical origin of
the reduced band gap.17−19

Another substitutional mechanism associates
the formation of titanium
vacancies (□) through the partial substitution of divalent
O2– by monovalent F– and OH–. This gives the opportunity to better understand the
impact of particular structural features related to the presence of
F–, OH–, and vacancies on the
band gap energy and the photogenerated carriers.

Experimentally,
nanoparticles of anatase featuring the general
chemical formula Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y can be synthetized by a sol–gel process activated under mild
solvothermal conditions.20 This synthesis
method allows to stabilize anisotropic particles with a large percentage
of reactive (001) facets along with a high concentration of titanium
vacancies arising from a large substitution rate of O2– by F–/OH–.21,22

In the present paper, we report the study of the impact of
titanium
vacancies on the band gap energy and the trapping of photoexcited
electrons and holes. The reactivity of the charge carriers diffusing
to the surface was monitored by photoelectrochemical measurements.
Anatase Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y shows a 2-fold
enhancement of quantum efficiency with a slight band gap reduction
of 0.08 eV as compared to anatase TiO2. Furthermore, we
took advantages of the high concentration of under-coordinated Ti
to functionalize the surface by a donor molecule, that is, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which further allows reducing
the band gap and reaching a 5 times higher quantum efficiency as compared
to anatase TiO2.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Cation-Defective Anatase (Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y)
The cation-defective anatase was prepared
by a previously reported method employing sol–gel chemistry
performed in the presence of Hydrofluoric acid (HF). This method allows
to stabilize the nanoparticles of anatase having the general chemical
formula Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y, where □
represents a titanium vacancy formed by the negative charge deficiency
induced by the partial substitution of oxide by fluoride and hydroxide
anions (Figure S1).20 In the present study, a compound featuring a high concentration
(x + y) of titanium vacancy was
prepared (see the Experimental Section). The
accurate chemical composition was assessed by determining the vacancy
concentration through structural refinement of the pair distribution
function (PDF) data, the fluorine content was determined by 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and the OH content
was deduced by electroneutrality leading overall to Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76.20,23 For comparison purpose, the cation-defective
free anatase TiO2 was prepared. Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) confirms the phase purities of both anatase samples (Figure S2). The optical absorption properties
of anatase TiO2 and Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 were investigated
by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (Figure 1). Doped and undoped anatase showed an absorption
edge within the 350–400 nm range, which corresponds to the
typical charge transfer region of O(2p)–Ti(3d).24 Although the deduced band gap energy is 3.2
eV for anatase TiO2, the band gap energy of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 is red-shifted to 3.12 eV. For TiO2, the conduction band
is characterized by the 3d states of Ti and the valence band is composed
of the 2p orbitals of O2–. In the case of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76, the valence band is composed of the 2p orbitals
of O2–, F–, and OH–. It was shown that the 2p states of F– ions are
localized rather at the bottom of the valence band, hence leading
to a higher band gap energy.25 On the other
hand, OH groups were proposed to decrease the band gap energy value
of a titanium hydroxyfluoride compound featuring titanium vacancies.26 We propose that the observed reduction of the
band gap energy observed is due to the presence of OH groups in larger
quantity than F– ions.

plots for anatase TiO2 and Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76.)

Electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) spectra were recorded (Figure 2) under dark and
light irradiation (in the spectral range of 250–1000 nm) to
investigate the ability of the anatase samples to generate paramagnetic
centers (PCs), that is, radicals and reduced Ti.27−30 The anatase TiO2 EPR
signal features a slightly asymmetrical shape and a g-factor value of 2.000 which can be assigned to electrons trapped
at oxygen vacancies (VO + e = VO–).31 The EPR signal of such oxygen vacancies
in TiO2 does not change with illumination. The most likely
reason for this phenomenon may be because the defects act as recombination
centers of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Therefore, the
amplitude of the EPR signal does not change with irradiation. Such
species can contribute to the absorption of light in the visible range
because they can create levels in the forbidden band (impurity absorption).
However, they are inactive for photoconversion, such as photocatalysis.
Under dark condition, no PCs were detected for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 (Figure 2), in agreement with
the sole presence of TiIV. Under illumination, a weak EPR
signal at around 3300–3340 G, with g1 = 2024, g2 = 2010, and g3 = 2003, is observed to be characteristic of O2– radicals. Furthermore, an intensive signal at
3350–3370 G with g⊥ = 1.9845
and g∥ = 1.958 assigned to TiIII (Figure 2) is also observed. In TiO2, the reduction of TiIV is combined with the formation of oxygen vacancy or OH groups leading
to TiIII/oxygen vacancy PCs.27,29 Moreover,
the line width of the TiIII centers signal is small (approximately
15 G), suggesting that these PCs are isolated (no overlapping of the
wave functions) and mainly localized in the bulk. Indeed, the dipole–dipole
interaction between PCs localized on sample surface and surrounding
paramagnetic oxygen molecules strongly increases the line width of
the EPR signal.32

TiO2 and Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 at T = 77 K under dark and illumination.

The photoelectrochemical properties of anatase TiO2 and
Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 were evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry
recorded under dark and UV–vis light conditions. The photocurrent
response (Figure 3a)
was calculated by subtracting the current measured under dark from
the current measured under UV–vis light. Overall, the measured
activity for water oxidation was low, which is probably due to the
porosity of the deposited film that might affect electron–hole
recombination, their electronic conductivity, and in fine the photocurrent
density. However, the photocurrent response of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 is
ca. 2 times higher than that of TiO2 at 0.70 V versus NHE.
More interestingly, a shift of the onset potential is observed going
from 0.10 V versus NHE for anatase TiO2 to −0.10
V versus NHE for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 (Figure 3a).

electrolyte (1 M Na2SO4, pH = 5). Scan rate
is 5 mV s–1. The photoanode geometric surface area
is 0.19 cm2. (c) IPCE spectra of TiO2 and Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 photoanodes at 1 V/NHE. (Inset: Tauc plots for
the direct optical transitions of TiO2 and Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 photoanodes.)

The higher photocurrent
and the negative shift of the photocurrent
onset potential clearly indicate that the anatase Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 exhibits lower electron–hole recombination rate compared
to anatase TiO2. Because of the similar specific surface
area for TiO2 (∼180 m2 g–1, data not shown) and Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 (∼190 m2 g–1, data not shown), this phenomena can
be related to the presence of surface and bulk defects in Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76.33 It has been shown that O2– radicals are very active species for photocatalytic
processes, for example, to decompose toxic substances on oxide surface.
Therefore, the presence of these radicals at the surface of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76, upon light irradiation, might play a role in
the modification of the charge separation process observed between
these two anatases.

To further illustrate this point, photocurrent
transient measurements
were performed to measure the charge recombination at the semiconductor/electrolyte
interface. In Figure 3b, the evolution of the photocurrents is reported when light is turned
on and off, with a frequency of 0.062 Hz. Anatase TiO2 and
Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 show distinct behaviors. On the one hand, a sharp
anodic transient photocurrent occurs upon illumination of TiO2, showing that the photogenerated holes move to the semiconductor/electrolyte
junction and accumulate (the carriers oxidize trap states in the bulk
and on the surface).34 This is followed
by photocurrent stabilization when equilibrium is reached between
water oxidation and charge recombination.35 Conversely, when the light is turned off, the photocurrent decay
is assigned to electrons recombining with the accumulated holes. Regarding
anatase Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76, a gradually increase of the transient
photocurrent is observed and a stabilization (stable photocurrent)
occurs at a much longer time. These distinct behaviors are attributed
to differences in equilibrium between the rate of water oxidation
and charge recombination; a longer recombination rate of electron–holes
was observed in the case of anatase Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 where
electrons are stabilized at the TiIII centers and then
the electron–hole recombination rate is reduced.

To better
understand the interplay between the photoelectrochemical
activity and light absorption, the incident photon-to-current conversion
efficiency (IPCE) of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 compared with that
of TiO2 was evaluated using the following law: IPCE = 1239.8jph/λPw,36 where jph is the
measured photocurrent density (mA cm–2) and Pw is the incident power density (mW cm–2) at the wavelength λ (nm). After applying the light source
photoemission correction, the IPCE spectra (Figure 3c) show that Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 exhibits
an enhanced photoelectrochemical activity in the UV range as compared
to TiO2, suggesting that the separation and transportation
of photogenerated charge carriers occur more efficiently. The inset
of Figure 3c shows
the Tauc plot for a direct optical transition (n =
1/2) in jph = A(hν – Eg)n/hν.37 The linear extrapolation at the energy axis yields an Eg of 3.21 eV for anatase TiO2, in agreement
with literature data38 and an Eg of 3.13 eV for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76. This latter
result agrees with the result obtained from the UV–vis absorbance
spectrum.

2.2 Surface Functionalization of Anatase Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76
To improve the properties of anatase
Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76, we used the absorption of donor molecules, an
established way to modify properties.39,40 We found that
the optical properties of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 can be modified
when NMP molecules are adsorbed on its surface, as revealed by the
yellowish color of the powder (Figure 4a,b). Such a surface modification was shown to be effective
only on the anatase Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76. The coloration of
the powder is observed by dispersing the powder into NMP (see the Experimental Section) for more than 3 days under
air atmosphere. No coloration was observed when the experiment is
performed under dry atmosphere (Figure S3). Then, it can be assumed that H2O molecules induce hydroxylation,
which in turn enables the functionalization of the nanoparticles with
NMP molecules (Figure S4). These reactions
are specific to Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 because no color change was noticed
for pure anatase TiO2 (Figure S5). Figure 4c shows
the UV–vis absorption spectra of anatase Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 before
and after the surface functionalization with NMP molecules. The sample
treated with NMP shows an additional absorption feature within the
visible range, that is, ∼550 nm, in agreement with its yellow
color. Moreover, a plot of (αhν)1/2 versus hν (see inset of Figure 4c) using the modified
Kubelka–Munk method reveals a slight decrease of the band gap
energy from 3.12 to 3.03 eV and a second feature occurring at 2.25
eV.

(Inset: Kubelka–Munk vs photon energy plots for anatase Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 before and after NMP functionalization.)

Elemental analysis was performed
at the level of an aggregate of
nanoparticles of NMP-Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y (Figure 5a). Elemental
mapping (Figure 5b–e)
obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in a scanning
transmission electron microscope revealed the presence of nitrogen
atoms present in the whole area of the aggregate, suggesting a homogeneous
grafting of NMP molecules at the surface of the nanoparticles.

The effective grafting
of NMP molecules was also confirmed by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The XPS spectrum of NMP-Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y (Figure 6) shows the appearance of a N 1s peak centered
at 400.5 eV, which is characteristic of pyrrole nitrogen atom in NMP.41,42

and after NMP treatment.

2.2.1 Structure and Spectroscopic Analysis of
NMP-Functionalized Anatase Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y
To probe the structural impact of the NMP functionalization,
we first performed XRD analysis which confirms that the long-range
order remains intact after the NMP treatment (Figure S2). Subsequently, we used the PDF obtained by Fourier
transformation of synchrotron-based XRD data to analyze any structural
deviation occurring at the short-range order. Figure 7 shows the refined PDF patterns of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 and NMP-Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y samples. The extracted structural parameters are gathered in Table S1. Both anatase samples showed similar
unit cell parameters and a close coherence length of ca. 4 nm, suggesting
that the long-range order was not modified upon functionalization.
The refinement of the Ti site occupancy, however, shows a slight decrease
of the titanium vacancy with site occupancies of ca. 69(3)% for pristine
Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 sample and 75(2)% for NMP-Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y sample, indicating a modification of the chemical
composition, that is, a decrease of F (x) and/or
OH (y) contents.

Figure 7 PDF refinements of anatase Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 and NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66.

The treatment with NMP results in a substantial decrease
of the
fluorine wt % (from ∼13.3 to ∼9.3 wt %) measured by 19F solid-state NMR. According to the general chemical formula
Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y, the pristine Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 becomes Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 after the NMP treatment. This
may be explained by the hydrolysis of water, yielding a partial defluorination
of the network according to Ti–F + H2O →
Ti–OH + HF. Concomitantly, oxolation reaction such as Ti–OH
+ HO–Ti → Ti–O–Ti + H2O occurs,
thereby decreasing the OH content.

The change in the chemical
composition was confirmed by XPS analysis.
Atomic percentage analysis of Ti 2p3/2, O 1s (that includes
Ti–O and Ti–OH contributions) and F 1s peak was performed
for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 and NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66. The
atomic percentages of Ti/O/OH/F change from 30/40/5/25 for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 to 30/48/3/19 for NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66, confirming
changes in the sample stoichiometry induced by the treatment.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Figure S6) showed that the NMP functionalization induces noticeable differences
in the thermal behavior, which might be due to a dual effect of the
grafting of the NMP molecules and the chemical composition changes.

To better understand the changes occurring during the NMP treatment
at the local level, we performed 19F and 1H
solid-state NMR experiments. The 19F MAS NMR (Figure 8) spectrum of the
pristine sample features three lines previously assigned to fluorine
atoms coordinated with different numbers of titanium atoms and/or
titanium vacancies, namely, species Ti3–F at −87
ppm, Ti2□–F at −4 ppm, and Ti□2–F at 76 ppm.20 The 19F MAS NMR spectrum of NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 differs from
those of the pristine sample. The three main lines are broader and
those assigned to Ti□2–F and Ti3–F are asymmetric (and are then fitted with two contributions).
The fluorine environments are then even more disordered in NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 than in Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76. Because of the
decrease of the titanium vacancy rate, the proportion of Ti2□–F decreases and those of Ti□2–F
remains constant. An increase of the proportion of Ti3–F
species is expected but with a lower extent than observed. Indeed,
despite the partial defluorination, the sample contains a larger quantity
of Ti3–F species after the treatment. This further
highlights that the treatment is accompanied by a local structural
rearrangement. Finally, a resonance appears at −122.5 ppm,
attributed to adsorbed F– ions,43,44 resulting from the partial defluorination of the network.

bands. The individual contributions used for the fits are shown below
the fits, and parameters used for these fits are given as the Supporting Information (Tables S2 and S3).

The 1H MAS NMR experimental
and reconstructed spectra
of the sample before and after the NMP treatment are shown in Figure 9. According to the
increase of the chemical shifts upon increasing the number of Ti-surrounding
OH groups observed in anatase by Crocker et al.45 and to the assignments (of the species Ti3–OH,
Ti2□–OH, and Ti□2–OH)
in Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y samples21 and (of the species Ti□–X, Ti2–X,
Ti□3–X, Ti2□2–X, Ti3□–X, and Ti4–X)
in a layered lepidocrocite-type structure,46 the species Ti3–OH, Ti2□–OH,
and Ti□2–OH are expected to give signals
in the ranges of 6–8, 4–5, and 1–2 ppm, respectively.
On the basis of this trend, the four NMR resonances used to reconstruct
the spectrum of the pristine sample have been tentatively assigned
(Table S4 and Figure 9). The relative intensities of these NMR
resonances point out that OH groups preferentially form Ti2□–OH and Ti3–OH species.

Despite a decrease of the OH content,
because of the grafting of
NMP molecules, the 1H MAS NMR spectra recorded before and
after the treatment feature similar integrated intensities. Nevertheless,
the treatment induces significant changes in the spectrum. First,
a broad resonance appears at about 2.3 ppm. This new contribution
is assigned to the H atoms of NMP in accordance with their 1H δiso values in solution ranging from 2.0 to 3.4
ppm (Table S5). Second, the NMR signal
of the Ti□2–OH species vanishes or, more
likely, is substantially reduced and hidden by the broad contribution
of NMP. The decrease of the quantity of Ti□2–OH
species cannot be explained solely by the decrease of the titanium
vacancy rate. Then, it can be assumed that they are preferentially
involved in the oxolation reactions.

To probe the presence of
PCs in the NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 sample,
we performed EPR spectroscopy (Figure 10). Similarly, to the pristine compound,
under dark condition, the EPR spectrum indicates the absence of TiIII. However, weak EPR signals appear in the range of 3300–3340
G, characteristic of O2– radicals,47 indicating that the NMP treatment induces changes
in reactivity even under dark.

Figure 10 EPR spectra of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 and
NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 anatase
at T = 77 K under dark and illumination.

Under illumination, we observed significant changes
on the EPR
spectrum features. The previous signal at around 3300–3340
G, characteristic of O2– radicals, significantly
increases. Moreover, similarly to the pristine compound, an intense
signal at 3350–3370 G is assigned to TiIII (g⊥ = 1.9845 and g∥ = 1.958). The line width of this signal reflects that
these PCs are isolated and mainly localized in the bulk.32

A quantitative assessment of the TiIII and O2– radicals shows that
the NMP treatment significantly
modifies the reactivity of anatase. Indeed, the content of TiIII centers is 6 × 1016 spin/g for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 and 5 × 1017 spin/g for NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66.

The O2– radical content further grows
under illumination from ∼1014 spin/g for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 to 3 × 1017 spin/g for NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66. Most strikingly, the TiIII/O2– ratio strongly decreases after the NMP
treatment, going from 600 (=6 × 1016/1014) to 1.67 (=5 × 1017/3 × 1017). This
indicates that the treatment not only increases the concentration
of TiIII but also most importantly seems to limit the electron–hole
recombination. Indeed, the photoexcited electrons are captured by
oxygen molecules and TiIV centers, leading to a space separation
of the charge carriers and prevents their recombination with photoexcited
holes. We do not detect photoexcited holes by the EPR technique, which
is probably due to their very short relaxation times and, correspondingly,
to the large width of the EPR signal line.

2.2.2 Photoelectrochemistry
on NMP-Functionalized
Photoanodes
Photoelectrochemical measurements were further
performed to understand the impact of the NMP treatment. Figure 11a gathers the electrochemical
response under UV–vis light illumination for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 and NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 anatase. Compared to Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76, NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 shows a 2.5-fold increase of the photocurrent.
Additionally, one should notice that the photocurrent onset potential
of NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 is further shifted to a more negative
potential, that is, −0.16 V versus NHE. A comparison of these
values with anatase TiO2 shows a total potential shift
of ΔE = 0.26V. The electrochemical responses
under intermittent light (Figure 11b) have the same behavior for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 and
NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66, indicating that the electron–hole
recombination rate is low compared to anatase TiO2. As
it was observed for Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76, EPR measurement, under
light, indicated the formation of TiIII centers where electrons
are localized. These electron scavengers allow holes to react directly
with water. Furthermore, the onset potential under illumination is
negatively shifted, indicating that holes do not have the same reactivity
to form OH radicals. This is a strong indication of a direct charge
transfer of holes. This is also supported by the high IPCE values
observed for NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 (Figure 11c). Additionally, the IPCE spectrum of NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 sample shows a weak contribution in the visible
range up to ca. 475 nm. The Tauc plot (inset in Figure 11c) allows an estimation of
a band gap of 2.97 eV with a second threshold featured at 2.50 eV
for NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66, in agreement with the results obtained
by UV–vis absorption.

optical transitions of Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 and NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 photoanodes.)

The treatment with NMP
results from a surface functionalization
and a chemical composition change. These two effects were shown to
have distinct consequences on the optical absorption properties. We
first observed a red shift of the O(2p)–Ti(3d) charge transfer
from 3.12 to 3.03 eV. Such a red shift can be assigned to the changes
in the chemical composition, particularly to the partial defluorination
of the network and possibly to the modification of the proton environments.
The speciation, that is, the number of neighboring cations, of OH
groups and fluoride can also induce different effects on the band
gap energy. The ionocovalent character of Ti–X (X = F, OH)
bonds is dictated by the speciation of these species with Ti–X
bonds being more covalent in Ti1□2–X
than in Ti2□1–X. This point should
be more carefully investigated. The second effect observed after the
NMP treatment is the appearance of a broad absorption band within
the visible range and responsible of the yellow color, leading to
a reduced band gap energy at 2.25–2.50 eV. We assigned this
broad absorption band to the effective grafting of the electron-donating
NMP molecules expected to reduce the band gap energy.48 Hence, NMP-Ti0.75□0.25O1.00F0.34(OH)0.66 can be better described
by a core–shell structure that synergistically favors the formation
and separation of electron–hole carriers, similar to the previous
report activating anatase TiO2 with a coated carbon shell,
producing the same color features and increased photoelectrochemical
activities.49 It should be noted that after
several photoelectrochemical tests, the coloration of the powder did
not evolve, suggesting that NMP molecules are strongly bound to the
surface.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, we report on the optical and photoelectrochemical
properties of anatase featuring an oxy-hydroxyfluorinated network
with titanium vacancies (Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76). Compared to pure
TiO2, this compound showed a red shift of 0.08 eV assigned
to changes in the ionocovalent character of the titanium–anion
bonding. Under illumination, we measured EPR signals characteristic
of TiIII and radicals O2– which
were absent in pure TiO2. We further showed that the ability
to induce photogenerated charge carriers in Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76 enabled
higher photocurrent and more negative shift of the photocurrent onset
potential as compared to pure TiO2. We subsequently attempted
to modify the surface of the oxy-hydroxyfluorinated anatase by using
coordinating NMP molecules. The functionalization, which was shown
to be specific to Ti0.69□0.31O0.76F0.48(OH)0.76, led to a modification of the
chemical composition as shown by PDF analysis and 1H/19F solid-state NMR. Moreover, we demonstrated the effective
grafting of the electron-donating NMP molecules, which induces the
appearance of a new absorption band in the visible range corresponding
to an estimated band gap of 2.25–2.50 eV. Hence, the as-prepared
composite material showed enhanced photoelectrochemical properties.
Such an increasing performance was ascribed to an increasing ability
to generate and separate photogenerated charge carriers. This work
provides new opportunities in the development of high-performance
photocatalysts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y and NMP-Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y
Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y was synthesized
using the sol–gel chemistry under solvothermal conditions following
previous reports.20,23,50 In short, 1.2 mL of HF was added to a mixture solution containing
24.8 mL of isopropanol and 4 mL of titanium isopropoxide in a 45 mL
Teflon line container. The Teflon line container was loaded into a
stainless steel autoclave. After sealing the autoclave, the solution
was heated at 90 °C for 12 h, and the white powder was recovered
from the solution. The recovered powder was dried at 80 °C overnight.
Such a low temperature was used to avoid the thermal dehydroxylation
of the compound, enabling to preserve a high vacancy concentration.23

Anatase functionalized with NMP was obtained
by stirring 500 mg of the as-prepared Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y in 20 mL of NMP at room temperature for 7 days. A yellow powder
was recovered from the solution using centrifugation and washed several
times with ethanol. The solid was dried at 80 °C overnight.

For the sake of comparison, anatase TiO2 was synthesized
without HF followed by a post-heat treatment at 300 °C under
air for 2 h to obtain crystallized anatase TiO2 (Figure S2). The heating temperature was adjusted
to obtain pure TiO2 with particle sizes close to that of
anatase Ti1–x–y□x+yO2–4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y (Table S1).

4.2 Physical Characterizations
XRD measurements
were carried out on a Rigaku diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation
in a Bragg–Brentano geometry.

TGA was performed on a
METTLER TOLEDO thermogravimetric analyzer under argon atmosphere at
a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 from room temperature
to 600 °C.

UV–visible adsorption spectra were recorded
using an Agilent
Technologies Cary Series spectrophotometer.

Scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM)–EDX measurement
was performed using FEI-TITAN 80–300 kV with ChemiSTEM capability
(Cs probe corrector and extreme field emission gun (X-FEG)).

X-ray scattering measurements were performed for PDF analysis at
the 11-ID-B beam line at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National
Laboratory. Similar to previous reports,23,50 high-energy X-rays (λ = 0.2128 Å) were used to collect
data yielding high values of momentum transfer Q ≈
22 Å–1.51 By the
integration of the diffraction images, one-dimensional diffraction
data were achieved.52 After the correction
of the background and the Compton scattering, the G(r) function was extracted from the data using PDFgetX2.53 The PDF data were refined with the PDFgui software,54 and the refined parameters were the scale factor, s ratio, sp diameter (i.e., particle diameter), lattice
parameters, oxygen atomic position, titanium (4a Wyckoff site) rate
occupancy, and isotropic atomic displacement parameters.

1H and 19F solid-state magic angle spinning
(MAS) NMR experiments were performed in the same way (spectrometer,
probe head, pulse sequences, and references) as previously employed
for Ti1–x□xO1–4x(OH)4x+yF2–y.551H and 19F spectra were
fitted by using the DMFit software.5619F solid-state NMR was also used to quantify the fluorine
content on the studied samples by using reference samples.20−22,55

XPS characterization was
performed with a VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer
at the operating pressure of 3 × 10–9 mbar
using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν
= 1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source, as described in the previous report.23 The energy of spectrometer was calibrated with
reference to the binding energy (BE) of clean Au sample (Au 4f7/2 at 84 eV). The pass energy of the analyzer was 100 eV for
survey and 20 eV for the high-resolution spectra (Ti 2p, C 1s, O 1s,
N 1s, and F 1s). The BE of peaks was calibrated by setting the C 1s
signal corresponding to −CH2–CH2– bonds at 285.0 eV. The Advantage software (version 5.954)
was employed to perform a peak fitting using a Shirley background
and Gaussian/Lorentzian line shape with a ratio of 70/30.

EPR
spectra were recorded by the standard Bruker EPR spectrometer
ELEXSYS-500 (X-band, sensitivity is around ∼1010 spin/G). To illuminate the samples directly in the spectrometer,
the optical cavity was used. The samples were positioned in flat ampoules.
Etalon CuCl2·2H2O was used for the calculation
of PC concentration. Mn2+ in MgO was employed as a reference
for g-values. The samples were illuminated in situ
(directly in the EPR cavity) with a high-pressure tungsten lamp in
the spectral range 250–1000 nm. The intensity of the illumination
was 40 mW/cm2. The measured temperature was 77 K. Experiments
at liquid nitrogen temperature were carried out using a finger cryostat.

4.3 Photoelectrochemical Characterizations
4.3.1 Photoanodes
A suspension containing
10 mg of active powder and 2 mL of ethanol was prepared. The mixture
was ultrasonically stirred for 2 h to ensure a homogeneous dispersion;
after that, 300 μL of suspension was sprayed via an airbrush
over the conductive SnO2:F (YSUB/ASASHI120/1:10 ×
30 mm, SOLEMS) surface. The resistance of the glass was 80 Ω/sq.
The deposit was dried at 100 °C under air for 2 h. The electric
contact of the electrode was done by a copper foil sticker in a region
free of active material.

4.3.2 Photoelectrochemical
Measurements
Current–potential curves were measured
in a three-electrode
photoelectrochemical cell with a working Ti-based porous layer photoanodes,
a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The
photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in an argon-purged
1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under UV–vis radiation.
A shutter was used during these experiments. The measured potentials
versus Ag/AgCl were converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)
according to the following equation: E versus NHE
= E versus Ag/AgCl + 0.197 V. IPCE action spectra
were recorded at 1.0 V/NHE under UV–vis illumination at 300–550
nm with a 150 W xenon lamp (Spectral Products, ASB-XE-175EX) with
an incident irradiation power at the electrode of 34 mW/cm2. Note that the lower light intensity was used in the present study,
generating lower photocurrent, compared to the commonly used light
intensity (100 mW/cm2) in the literature. Generally speaking,
the photocurrent increases with the light intensity. Indeed, solar
light between 400 and 700 nm with 2–4% UV is called AM 1.5,
with ca. 100 mW/cm2, which is essential for solar cells.
In this study, the incident power density is only essential to calculate
the IPCE by applying the light source photoemission correction. All
aqueous solutions were prepared using 18.2 MΩ·cm Millipore
Milli-Q water, and all measurements were conducted with illumination
of the film–electrolyte interface through a 0.19 cm2 mask at the working electrode in the UV–vis light range.
