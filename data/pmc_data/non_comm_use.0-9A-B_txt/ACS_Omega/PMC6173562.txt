Rapid
and accurate diagnostic technologies for early-state identification
of cardiovascular abnormalities have become of high importance to
prevent and attenuate their progression. The capability of biosensors
to determine an increase in the concentration of cardiovascular protein
biomarkers in circulating blood immediately after a myocardial infarction
makes them ideal point-of-care platforms and alternative approaches
to electrocardiograms, chest X-rays, and different laboratory-based
immunoassays. We report here a generic approach toward multianalyte
sensing platforms for cardiac biomarkers by developing aptamer-based
electrochemical sensors for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP-32) and
cardiac troponin I (cTnI). For this, commercial gold-based screen-printed
electrodes were modified electrophoretically with polyethyleneimine/reduced
graphene oxide films. Covalent grafting of propargylacetic acid integrates
propargyl groups onto the electrode to which azide-terminated aptamers
can be immobilized using Cu(I)-based “click” chemistry.
To ensure low biofouling and high specificity, cardiac sensors were
modified with pyrene anchors carrying poly(ethylene glycol) units.
In the case of BNP-32, the sensor developed has a linear response
from 1 pg mL–1 to 1 μg mL–1 in serum; for cTnI, linearity is observed from 1 pg mL–1 to 10 ng mL–1 as demanded for early-stage diagnosis
of heart failure. These electrochemical aptasensors represent a step
further toward multianalyte sensing of cardiac biomarkers.

1 Introduction
The incidence and prevalence
of cardiovascular diseases rise in
many parts of the world. The need for fast and accurate diagnosis
has become crucial to prevent and limit heart failure. Cardiovascular
diseases, chronic conditions that get worse over time, are classified
into four stages ranging from high risk to advanced heart failure
probability, and treatment plans are provided accordingly. It is well
known that effective intervention at an early stage can prevent and
attenuate their progression. Next to conventional methods for the
diagnosis of eventual heart failure, such as electrocardiograms1 and chest X-rays,2 the detection of cardiovascular biomarkers3 provides a simple method for early indication of the disease. The
current methods used to identify the presence of cardiac biomarkers
are based on antigen–antibody recognition, such as the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or rely on fluorescence or radiochemical
detection.4 Even though these immunoassays
are developing rapidly, their main drawbacks are related to long analysis
time and cross-reactivity issues. These drawbacks can be overcome
by the use of biosensors as cheap and fast detection tools that can
be integrated in multiplexed point-of-care devices.5 The development of various sensors for the detection of
cardiovascular biomarkers is consequently rapidly advancing,6 with electrochemical transduction being one of
the most advanced methods in this field for fast and accurate sensing.7−11

We have, for example, shown recently that nitrogen-doped reduced
graphene oxide (N-prGO)-modified electrodes when covalently modified
with Tro4 aptamers result in electrochemical sensors applicable for
cardiac troponin I (cTnI) detection down to 1 pg mL–1.7 These sensors specified that acute
myocardial infarction (AMI)-diagnosed patients, the most immediately
life-threatening syndrome, leading to particularly severe cardiac
events, such as irreversible damage in the myocardium, have a saliva
cTnI level as high as 675 pg mL–1.

Next to
cTnI, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) have been recognized as powerful
cardiovascular biomarkers for acute heart failure.12 These natriuretic peptides are released in response to
pressure overload in ventricles and increased stress on ventricular
walls. BNP is first synthesized as pre-pro-BNP, which upon proteolytic
processing is split into BNP and the amino terminal fragment NT-pro-BNP,
with no biological activity. In clinical practice, NT-pro-BNP detection
is mostly performed as NT-pro-BNP has a circulation time of about
1–2 h, while that of BNP is only 20 min. Nevertheless, BNP
would be the more desirable biomarker for heart failure considering
the rapid release and diffusion from the injured tissue to the blood.
Moreover, it has a well-defined cutoff level of 100 pg mL–1.13 While both natriuretic peptides are
produced similarly, plasma levels of NT-proBNP are influenced by renal
functions14 and are strongly susceptible
to the age of the patient. However, the detection of BNP is more challenging
compared to other cardiovascular biomarkers, as the BNP blood level
in healthy patients is low (20 pg mL–1; 6 pM) and
rises to only about 2 ng mL–1 (600 pM) in patients
with acute heart failure.15 This might
be the reason why there are a limited number of sensors for BNP described
so far. A miniaturized immunosensor was reported by Niwa and co-workers
and reached a detectable concentration range of 5 pg mL–1 to 100 ng mL–1.16 One
of the first electrochemical biosensors for BNP is that of Matsuura
et al. with a reported detection limit of 20–40 pg mL–1, on the limit to detect basal levels of BNP in blood.17,18 It relies on acetylcholinesterase-labeled anti-BNP antibodies undergoing
an immunological reaction with BNP. The assay is rather long (2 h)
to complete, and the analysis has to be performed in deaerated alkaline
solution. An optical lateral flow immunoassay has been recently proposed
by Gong et al. using gold nanoparticles modified with BNP antibodies,
which reached a detection limit of BNP down to 100 pg mL–1 using a simple assay format.19 Electrical
impedance measurements in silicon nanowells have been proposed by
Prasad et al. for BNP using anti-BNP as a specific ligand with a detection
limit of 1 ag mL–1.20 The group of Pingarron has reported recently the electrochemical
detection of BNP down to 4 pg mL–1 involving peroxidase-labeled
BNP antibodies on screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with gold
nanoparticles.9 Esteban-Fernández
de Ávila et al.21 proposed carbon-based
screen-printed electrodes (SPE) as ideal interfaces for the simultaneous
and independent amperometric detection of NT-pro-BNP and cardiac reactive
protein (CRP). Bruno et al. demonstrated the interest of an aptamer–magnetic
bead electrochemiluminescence sandwich assay for the detection of
BNP with a pg mL–1 detection limit.22 The assay used SPE modified with magnetic beads with covalently
immobilized NT-proBNP antigen or anti-CRP specific capture antibodies
to trap the biomarkers. This was followed by analyte quantification
via indirect competitive and sandwich-type immunoassays, respectively,
using horseradish peroxidase-labeled tracers. The developed methodology
achieved detection limits of only 470 pg mL–1 for
both analytes.

We show in this work that commercially available
gold-based screen-printed
electrodes when modified electrophoretically by a polyethyleneimine
(PEI)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite film result in robust
and sensitive electrochemical platforms for the sensing of BNP in
serum without the need for any label (Figure 1). Branched PEI was previously proposed as
an effective linker for the quantitative immobilization of biomolecules
in sensing platforms with electrochemical detection.11 In this work, the presence of NH2 groups on
PEI (Figure 1) allows
the covalent linking of BNP-specific ligands, DNA aptamers in our
case. Their affinity to specific epitopes on target proteins such
as BNP is defined by their sequences, selected in vitro by an iterative
and stringent process. Unlike antibodies, aptamers have the advantage
of being produced in a fast, reproducible manner and in large quantities.
Their interest for sensing platforms is in addition related to their
increased stability, thus representing stable and innovative ligands
for biosensors. Despite their great potential, aptamers are yet to
be more widely integrated into biosensors and tested under clinically
relevant conditions. The strategy proposed in this work allows achieving
sub-pM BNP detection limits in serum without the need for any amplification
strategy. The possibility of sensing using screen-printed electrodes
makes this approach, in addition, appropriately operational for parallel
multianalyte sensing, which will be exemplified in sensing cardiac
troponin I (cTnI) using the same strategy as developed for BNP, by
simply changing the used aptamer.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Electrophoretic Modification of Screen-Printed
Electrodes
SPEs were used in this work to bring the sensor
as close as possible to practical application. Using integrated systems
like this, the question remains how to modify selectively the working
electrode over the counter and reference electrodes to maintain good
electrochemical performance. Some of us have shown that electrophoretic
deposition (EPD) is beneficial for coating sensors as it enables to
obtain homogeneous coatings of controlled thickness. More recently,
we have shown that EPD can be applied to modify working electrodes
in electrochemical microsystems using an optimized process by mixing
PEI with GO for cathodic EPD.23 Charging
of GO with a cationic polymer such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) results
in a positive ζ-potential of +36.4 ± 1.3 mV and well-reduced
graphene oxide thin films. Figure 2A shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of SPE before and after modification with rGO/PEI upon the application
of +120 VDC for 20 s. In the case of SPE, cracks in the
surface of the electrode are clearly visible. After EPD of rGO/PEI
the surface roughness is increased and a homogenous deposit is observed
over the entire surface. These films have a thickness of 3 nm.

Figure 2 (A) SEM images
of SPE before and after electrophoretic coating
with rGO/PEI at 120 VDC for 20 s. (B) Differential pulse
voltammograms of SPE (black) and SPE-rGO/PEI (blue) recorded in [Fe(CN)6]4– (5 mM)/KCl (0.1 M). (C) Raman images

spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of SPE modified electrophoretically

Figure 2B exhibits
the differential pulse voltammograms of the SPE using [Fe(CN)6]4– as the redox probe, before and after
coating with rGO/PEI through electrophoretic deposition. The real
electrochemically active surface area of the SPE-rGO/PEI electrodes
is 0.149 cm2 as determined by plotting the peak current
against the square root of the scan rate,7 and is 18% higher than the geometrical area. Taking into account
the real electrochemically active area, it becomes evident that coating
SPE with a thin rGO/PEI film results in an increase of the anodic
peak current. The magnitude of the current correlates with the good
electronic properties of the rGO/PEI film, enhanced surface area,
and favorable electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged
redox probe and the positively charged rGO/PEI interface as reported
previously.24 The selective formation of
the rGO/PEI film on the gold working electrode is further validated
by recording Raman spectra at different parts of the SPE (Figure 2C). The D- and G-bands
are located at 1350 and 1582 cm–1, respectively,
with an ID/IG ratio of 0.89 for rGO/PEI, higher than that of GO with ID/IG = 0.71.25 No Raman spectrum was obtained outside the modified gold
microelectrode, notably on the reference electrode and on the counter
electrode, indicating that the deposition process is highly selective.

The XPS survey spectrum of the rGO/PEI films (Figure 2D) features peaks at binding
energies of 285, 532, and 400 eV due to C1s, O1s, and N1s respectively. In addition, bands due to Au 4f7/2 (85 eV), Au 4d5/2 (335 eV), and Au 4d3/2 (333 eV) are observed, indicating that the rGO/PEI layer is below
10 nm. The amount of N1s is determined to be 9.5 atom %.
The C1s core-level XPS image of SPE-rGO/PEI (Figure 2E) displays the characteristic
bands of rGO at 284.4 eV (sp2-hybridized carbon), together
with bands at 285.0 eV (sp3-hybridized carbon/C–H),
286.1 eV (C–O/C–N), and 287.2 eV (C–OX).26

2.2 Functionalization of SPE-rGO/PEI
Electrodes
The integration of propagyl functions onto SPE-rGO/PEI
was achieved
through covalent linking of propargylacetic acid (Figure 1) to the NH2 groups
of PEI using classical EDC/NHS chemistry. The SPE-propargyl electrode
can be further modified via click chemistry with aptamer ligands (Figure 1).27,28 The BNP aptamer chosen was aptamer A10 (Figure 1) as proposed by Wang et al. by the SELEX
process selection.29 This aptamer is reported
to have a dissociation constant of Kd =
12 ± 0.1 nM for BNP-32 peptide and be highly selective.29 In the case of cardiac troponin I protein sensing,
we used the Tro4 aptamer with a reported Kd = 270 pM,30 and it was shown to be adequate
for the formation of a selective electrochemical aptasensor for cTnI.7

The effectiveness of the surface modification
procedure used was confirmed by the high-resolution N1s XPS image (Figure 3A). It reveals a band at 400.2 eV due to the nitrogen in the triazole
ring (N=N–N)
and amide bonds (NH–C=O) as well as a band at 402.4
eV (N=N–N) with an additional
band at 398.2 eV due to the nitrogen in PEI.

Figure 3 (A) N1s core-level
spectrum of SPE-rGO/PEI-aptamer and
(B) differential pulse voltammograms of SPE-rGO/PEI (black) SPE-aptamer
(gray) and SPE-aptamer/PEG (blue) using [Fe(CN)6]4– (5 mM)/PBS (0.1 M).

The electrochemical behavior of the SPE-aptamer electrode
using
[Fe(CN)6]4–/3– as a redox couple
is seen in Figure 3B. Integration of the aptamer results in decreased current due to
the incorporation of aptamers carrying negatively charged phosphate
backbones. Further immersion into pyrene-PEG, where the lipophilic
pyrene part adheres strongly to rGO/PEI and the PEG unit confers the
surface with antifouling properties, does not affect strongly the
charge transfer.24

3.3 Electrochemical
Sensing of BNP-32 Peptide
Differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV) using [Fe(CN)6]4– as a redox probe
was used for the detection of BNP-32
peptide with the developed aptasensor. Addition of BNP-32 results
in a decrease of the redox current (Figure 4A) as the complex formed between the aptamer
and the peptide acts as a diffusion barrier, hindering the charge
transfer from the redox probe [Fe(CN)6]4– to the electrode surface. The sensor exhibits excellent analytical
performance for BNP-32 detection (Figure 4B) with a wide linear range between 1 pg
mL–1 and 1 μg mL–1 and correlation
of j (μA cm–2) = 771.2 –
105.2 log[BNP – 32] (pg mL–1)···(R2 = 0.9992). From a signal/noise ratio of 3/1
using intra-day assays, a detection limit of about 0.9 pg mL–1 is determined. As the blood BNP level under normal conditions is
about 20 pg mL–1, the detection limit is appropriate
for analyzing blood samples with the aptasensor. Moreover, acute heart
failure rises BNP concentration to levels around 2 ng mL–1, where the sensor is still in its linear range.15 This sensor format was also competitive with other reported
BNP sensing schemes (Table 1) in terms of not only sensitivity but also simplicity, as
it did not require the use of any enzyme or nanoparticle amplification.

The sensor proved to be
specific for BNP-32 (Figure 5A). A significant decrease of the current density is observed
in the presence of 100 pg mL–1 BNP-32, while addition
of several times higher concentrations of cTnI (6 μg mL–1), myoglobin (1.0 mg mL–1), or bovine
serum albumin (BSA) (60 mg mL–1) did not alter the
electrochemical signal.

(0.1 M) in BNP-32 (100 pg
mL–1) being the control (cont.) in the presence
of cTnI (6 μg mL–1), BSA (60 mg mL–1), and myoglobin (1.0 mg mL–1) and (B) reusability
after immersion into NaOH (0.1 M, pH 12.0) for 20 min. The signal
recorded for a concentration of BNP-32 peptide of 100 pg mL–1 was taken as the reference (error bars refer to the standard deviation
for n = 5 determinations).

Moreover, the reproducibility of the aptasensor fabrication
was
evaluated by testing its performance for BNP-32 sensing on different
electrodes (intra-day assays) and the coefficient of variation of
the signal recorded for 100 pg mL–1 BNP-32 was 5.9%
for n = 10 electrodes. When stored at 4 °C in
PBS for 1 month, the aptasensor response for 100 pg mL–1 BNP-32 decreased by 4%, indicating good storage stability.

While disposable sensors are relevant for endpoint measurements
in clinical settings (e.g., to minimize the risk of contamination),
reusable devices are desirable for studies monitoring the biomarker–drug
interaction or the evolution of cardiac biomarkers levels in a patient.
With progress in automation and miniaturization, sensor reusability
remains an important feature. By immersing the BNP-32 aptasensor into
NaOH (0.1 M, pH 12.0) for 20 min, the aptamer/BNP bond was broken
and the aptamer-based sensor coating was regenerated, enabling sensor
reuse. As demonstrated in Figure 5B, this cleaning and surface regeneration procedure
does not affect the sensitivity of the measurements for up to 10 tested
regeneration/sensing cycles.

The novel sensor was furthermore
tested in biological fluids. For
this purpose, we spiked human serum samples with BNP-32 standards
(Figure 6). From the
calibration curve (Figure 6A), a linear relationship between current density and BNP-32
concentration between 1 pg mL–1 and 1 μg mL–1 is seen according to j (μA
cm–2) = 773.9 – 96.5 log[BNP –
32] (pg mL–1)···(R2 = 0.9995). In comparison to the calibration curve obtained
in PBS (Figure 4B),
the sensitivity and the linear range are somehow reduced. The limit
of detection was estimated to be 1 pg mL–1, comparable
to the sensors in PBS.

serum
spiked with various BNP-32 concentrations. (B) DPV response of serum
samples of four different patients spiked with 100 pg mL–1 BNP-32 (results represent the average of n = 3
determinations).

2.4 Sensing
of cTnI in Serum Samples
To validate if the proposed sensor
strategy can be used for other
aptamers, a different SPE-propargyl electrode was modified via click
chemistry with cardiac troponin I (cTnI), an aptamer ligand with a
reported Kd = 270 pM.30 Using DPV and [Fe(CN)6]4–,
a linear range between 1 pg mL–1 and 10 ng mL–1, a correlation of j (μA cm–2) = 666 – 121 log[cTnI] (pg mL–1)···(R2 = 0.9992), and
a detection limit of 1 pg mL–1 are determined (Figure 7). The sensing characteristics
are in line with real demands with the cutoff level for cTnI in serum
for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) being 50 pg mL–1.

Figure 7 (A) DPV at various cTnI concentrations recorded with an SPE-aptamer/PEI
sensor. (B) Calibration curve for cTnI obtained with the aptasensor
(error bars refer to the standard deviation for n = 5 determinations).

2.5 Sensing in Real Samples for Clinical Diagnosis
Finally, serum samples, obtained from patients who reported heart
failure symptoms, were analyzed. Patient 1 showed a cTnI level of
3 pg mL–1, comparable to the classical enzyme-linked
fluorescence assay (ELFA) test (Table 2). This level in addition ruled out any ACS. Increased
cTnI levels were found for the other patients.

In the case of
BNP-32, in all of the samples, no BNP-32 could be
detected. This was confirmed by using the i-STAT BNP test (Abbott),
a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with a detection limit
of 15 pg mL–1.31 However,
NT-proBNP could be detected in these samples using the ELFA. This
is in line with the fast degradation of BNP-32 to NT-proBNP. Normal
concentrations of NT-proBNP are 10–300 pg mL–1, which indicates that patients 2–4 are high-risk individuals
for major cardiovascular events. These results also validate that
there is no direct correlation between BNP-32 and NT-proBNP levels
in blood.32,33

To check the accuracy of the electrochemical
aptasensor for higher
BNP-32 concentrations, the serum samples of all four patients were
spiked with 100 pg mL–1 BNP-32, the cutoff level
for positive ACS diagnosis. From the current response (Figure 6B), total BNP-32 concentrations
between 98 and 108 pg mL–1 could be determined with
a coefficient of variation for the various samples between 1.85 and
3.77% (n = 3 assays). The 98–108% recovery,
correlated with excellent repeatability indicates the very good accuracy
of the BNP aptasensor.

3 Conclusions
A robust
and sensitive electrochemical aptamer-based sensor for
the sensitive detection of two cardiovascular biomarkers, BNP and
cTnI, was obtained starting from commercially available gold-based
screen-printed electrodes that were coated by EPD with a PEI/rGO nanocomposite
film. The presence of the NH2 groups in PEI facilitated
the linking of a BNP-32 and cTnI aptamer via grafting a propargylacetic
acid linker followed by Cu(I)-based click-chemistry attachment of
the azide-terminated aptamer. While the use of specific aptamers with
dissociation constants in pM and nM ranges (for cTnI and BNP-32, respectively)
ensured highly sensitive recognition of the targeted biomarkers even
in complex matrices such as serum, the presence of rGO in the nanocomposite
coating enabled facile protection against nonspecific interactions
with other proteins, simply by immersion into poly(ethylene glycol)-modified
pyrene. The sensor design leads to a sensitive electrochemical platform
for the detection of BNP in serum without the need for any label with
a limit of detection of 0.9 pg mL–1 and high accuracy
demonstrated based on measurements of serum samples spiked with BNP-32.
Moreover, reuse of more than 10 assays without significant loss in
sensitivity was demonstrated.

To prove that the approach is
generic and can be extended to other
aptamers to advance toward multianalyte platforms for cardiac biomarker
detection, we have applied the same procedure for the cardiac troponin
aptamer. Serum samples from patients suspected of ACS were analyzed
in parallel with the aptasensors for BNP-32 and cTnI and by the standard
kits used in the hospitals, and a good agreement was determined. The
proposed reusable electrochemical aptasensors for BNP-32 and cTnI,
based on screen-printed electrodes, represent an advance toward cost-effective
multianalyte platforms for cardiac biomarker detection. Indeed, a
thorough diagnosis and monitoring of people with cardiac conditions
is in line with the current trend for multiplexed point-of-care devices,
as it requires simultaneous detection of multiple parameters, including,
besides BNP-32 and cTnI, biomarkers such as N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP)
and C reactive protein (CRP). The approach demonstrated here will
be advanced toward complete, “hybrid” systems for cardiac
monitoring, including not only aptamers but also antibodies or peptides
as biorecognition elements for best specificity and sensitive detection
of cardiac biomarkers. Integration with screen-printed eight-electrode
arrays is the next step in this direction as it will allow parallel
testing of a higher number of samples in clinical laboratories for
the validation of the proposed devices.

gold working electrode (A = 0.125 cm2),
a gold auxiliary electrode, and
a Ag reference electrode were obtained from DropSens, Spain.

Serum samples were collected from a peripheral vein of patients
admitted under suspicion of heart failure in the Cardiology Department
of “Agrippa Ionescu” Emergency Clinical Hospital, Bucharest,
Romania. The studied samples were provided as per the medical protocol
for heart failure suspicion and stored at −70 °C. The
study was approved by the Hospital’s Ethics Committee, and
all of the patients signed an informed consent.

4.2 Electrophoretic Deposition of rGO/PEI
GO/PEI dispersions
were obtained by mixing GO (1 mg mL–1) and PEI (1
mg mL–1) for 48 h at room temperature
under stirring. Gold-based SPEs were coated with a thin layer of PEI/rGO
by a cathodic electrophoretic deposition process by applying a direct
current voltage of 120 V for 20 s between the SPE (cathode) and a
Pt plate (anode).

4.3 Formation of Aptamer Sensors
(SPE-Aptamer/PEG)
Azide-terminated cardiovascular aptamers
were “clicked”
to SPE-rGO/PEI electrodes by first immersing into EDC (25 mM)/NHS
(25 mM) containing propargylacetic acid (20 mM) for 2 h, followed
by interaction of 5′-N3-modified aptamer (1 μM
in the presence of 10 mM CuSO4, 100 mM sodium ascorbate,
and 20 mM THPTA) ions for 7 h at room temperature and washing (three
times) with PBS. Finally, the electrode was immersed into pyrene-PEG
(1 mM)24 for 2 h at room temperature to
block nonspecific adsorption. The formed SPE-aptamer/PEG sensors were
stored in 0.01 M PBS at 4 °C before use.

4.4 Electrochemical
Sensing
Electrochemical
measurements were performed with a potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm
Autolab, The Netherlands). For the detection of BNP-32 peptide and
cTnI protein, differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs) were recorded
in a [Fe(CN)6]4– (5 mM) solution in 0.01
M PBS (pH 7.4) under a modulation amplitude of 50 mV with a step potential
of 5 mV, a modulation time of 0.05 s, and an interval time of 0.5
s. The SPE-aptamer/PEG electrode was immersed in BNP-32 or cTnI standard
solutions or undiluted serum solutions spiked with BNP-32 or cTnI
for 30 min. After rinsing with PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4, three times),
the electrodes were immersed in [Fe(CN)6]4– (5 mM in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4) and a DPV signal was recorded. The aptasensor
interface was regenerated upon immersion in NaOH (0.1 M, pH 12.0)
for 20 min.

4.5 Surface Characterization
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using an ULTRA 55 electron
microscope (Zeiss, France).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was carried out on a PHl 5000 VersaProbe-Scanning ESCA Microprobe
(ULVAC-PHI, Japan/USA) instrument at a base pressure below 5 ×
10–9 mbar with 90° between the X-ray source.
The spectra were decomposed into their components with mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian
(30:70) shape lines using CasaXPS software.

ζ-Potential
measurements were carried out with a Zeta-sizer
Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments Inc. Worcestershire, UK) at a sample
concentration of 10 μg mL–1 and measured in
Milli-Q water at pH 7.0.
