Self-heating of coal
mine goaf or shallow coal seams can release
an outbreak of unimaginable pollution disaster under suitable circumstances.
As an indicator gas, CO2 is always used to determine the
coal spontaneous combustion state during the self-heating process.
Based on this, the paper investigated the influence of abandoned coal
mine goaf CO2 on the surface environment by measuring the
CO2 concentration in the borehole connected to the goaf
and CO2 flux on the soil surface. Furthermore, rainfall
and atmospheric temperature effects are discussed to illustrate the
correlation between the CO2 concentration and surface soil
CO2 flux in the closed mine goaf. Subsequently, the tracer
gas experimental method is employed to analyze the effect of air leakage
from an open-pit slope on CO2 flux. The experimental results
demonstrated that the distribution of CO2 concentration
in the borehole confirms the continuous diffusion of goaf CO2 onto the surface. The value of CO2 flux in the goaf is
significantly higher than that of a normal area. Temperature is one
of the primary factors that affect the CO2 flux on the
field. Air leakage from the slope promotes the surface soil-overlying
goaf CO2 diffusion. The study provides important reference
data for the assessment of the mining area field environment and the
determination of the spontaneous combustion risk of the residual coal
in the goaf.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Coal has been the primary
energy resource in China. For a long
time, the large-scale exploitation of coal resources has led to an
increase in the area of goaf created by underground mining. At the
same time, the influence of the underground mined-out area has gradually
emerged on the surrounding environment. On the one hand, the toxic
and harmful gases are generated by the spontaneous combustion of residual
coal remained in the closed goaf and then diffused to the surface,
which affects the surface flora, fauna, and shallow microbes, thereby
affecting the ecological environment of the area. On the other hand,
by the action of high temperature and high pressure in the deep, the
CO2 gas in the closed goaf migrates to the surface. During
this process, CO2 gas can dissolve the shallow groundwater
that affects its characteristics by changing the pH and directly or
indirectly affect the surface soil–plant ecosystem.1−3 Therefore, the research on correlation between the underground coal-generated
CO2 concentration and surface soil CO2 flux
has become more and more important.

At present, the study on
the characteristics of spontaneous combustion
in the goaf mainly includes the beam tube monitoring method, tracer
gas method, infrared thermometer method, temperature sensor method,
etc.4 There are many factors, such as high
cost, complex implementation, and difficult installation, and so on,
which make it difficult to carry out. Meanwhile, the research on the
influence of the harmful gases generated by spontaneous combustion
in the goaf on its overlying surface and the analysis of spontaneous
combustion characteristics in the goaf by the change in surface CO2 emission concentration has not been carried out. Based on
this, on the premise of analyzing the spontaneous combustion characteristics
and the gas diffusion law in the closed goaf, the emission law of
CO2 from the overlying surface of the goaf and its influencing
factors were measured and analyzed by the intelligent soil gas monitoring
system combined with tracer gas monitoring equipment. Then, the effects
of CO2 concentration in the closed goaf on the changes
of surface CO2 flux and fluctuation laws were discussed
in the paper.

2 Experimental Apparatus and
Procedure
2.1 Outline of Measurement
Surface CO2 flux measurement is mostly used in environmental science
studies to investigate respiration characteristics of surface soil,
vegetation, and soil microorganisms.5−7 Previous studies show
that, during the whole process from coal low-temperature oxidation
to high-temperature pyrolysis, the reaction that produced CO2 takes up a large proportion in each stage.8−11 Therefore, it is feasible to
take CO2 as an indicator gas to determine the oxidation
state of goaf residual coal or shallow coal seam. The dynamic factors
that promote the goaf surface soil CO2 diffusion process
are as follows: (i) Mining process destroyed the original geological
structure and formed a large number of fissures, which is conducive
to the CO2 diffusion; (2) the goaf residual coal oxidized
or smoldered to generate heat, making the goaf ambient temperature
increase benefitting the gas emission; (3) overlying strata collapse
increases the goaf pressure, which is conducive to the CO2 emission. In addition, the respiration of microorganisms and plant
roots on the ground surface that produces CO2 is affected
by environmental conditions. It is clearly different from the gas
diffusion from the goaf. An approach to the prediction of coal spontaneous
combustion is presented under the assumption that the surface soil
CO2 flux can directly reflect the oxidation state of underground
coal. In this study, the surface soil CO2 flux, environmental
temperature, and wind velocity were measured continuously by the soil
gas flux monitoring system. The CO2 flux characteristics
including the fluctuation rule were analyzed to clarify the differences
between the fields of the normal area and over the goaf.

However,
surface CO2 flux overlying the goaf is dominated mainly
by the oxidation of residual coal remaining in the goaf. The results
show that, in the process of CO2 diffusion to the surface,
some of CO2 will dissolve in the underground aquifer; a
small amount of CO2 will be fixed by the rock medium or
by microorganisms and plants near the surface; and most of CO2 produced by spontaneous combustion in the goaf will diffuse
to the surface.12,13 Therefore, the flux change of
surface CO2 can indirectly reflect the spontaneous combustion
state of the goaf. Studying the variation law of surface CO2 flux can effectively analyze the spontaneous combustion process
of residual coal in the goaf.

The surface soil CO2 flux is the amount of CO2 gas emission per unit area
and unit time, which is defined as 1  where F is
the gas flux (mol·m–2·s–1), ρ is the standard state gas density (kg·m–3), V is the gas chamber volume (m3), A is the surface area of CO2 emission (m2), M is the gas molecular weight (g·mol–1), Ct is the linear increase
in CO2 concentration in parts per million (10–6), Δt is the time step (s), g is the gravitational acceleration (m·s–2), P is the absolute pressure of the measuring point (Pa), P0 is the standard atmospheric pressure, T is the temperature of the measuring point (K), and T0 is the standard state temperature (K).

The characteristics of CO2 emission were monitored by
the closed chamber method in the field measurements.14 In this study, a constant volume automatic ventilation
chamber (HL-1017B) was used to measure the gas exchange flux between
the soil and the atmosphere environment. By drilling holes on the
surface of the goaf to monitor the distribution of CO2 concentration
in the borehole with a multichannel gas analyzer (SKY2000-M3), the
emission and diffusion characteristics of CO2 in the goaf
are analyzed. The tracer gas technique was used to find out the source
and route of air leakage in the slope of the test area and verify
the influence of air leakage on the variation of goaf surface CO2 flux.

2.2 Field Measurement Methodology
The
targeted field is located on the overlying surface of the mined-out
area including goafs on the east side, about 150 m away from the Haizhou
Open-Pit Mine, as shown in Figure 1. The Haizhou Open-Pit Mine is 3 km away from the Fuxin
City center. The mining area is 4 km long from east to west and 2
km wide from north to south. The Haizhou Open-Pit Mine 250 m deep
and involves a total area of 30 km2 was closed and stopped
its production. The average annual rainfall in this area is 539 mm,
and the evaporation is 1800 mm. It is a semi-arid continental monsoon
climate zone in the north temperate zone.15 The soil type in the mining area is composed mainly of cinnamon
soil; the sandy soil layer is about 3.0–5.5 m in thickness.
The content of the organic matter is 1.2–1.5%, and the soil
pH value is between 7.1 and 7.5.

Figure 1 Map of measurement locations.

As shown in Figure 1, the measurement locations on the surface area are
as follows: the
#0 point on normal soil in is an unmined area, #2 and #3 points are
on the surface over the goaf, and the #1 point is a wellbore 80 m
in depth, which connects to the goaf. Also, the diameter of the wellbore
upper part (H ≤ 6 m) is 27 cm. The layout
of monitoring points in the borehole is shown in Figure 2. There are six coal seams
in the location. From the bottom to the top are Gaode 3, Gaode 2,
1.0 m, 2.5 m, 1.5 m, and 1.3 m coal seams, respectively. Among them,
the 1, 1.5, and 2.5 m coal seams are not mined, and the coal seam
elevation is between −75 and −30 m (ground elevation
is about +180 m). About 70 m on the west side of the measuring point
is the Gaode 2 chasm. The geological condition of the monitoring points
and surface soil properties and atmospheric parameters of the measuring
area are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

In this
study, the long-term monitoring method of the surface CO2 flux was carried at #0, #2, and #3 points (Figure 3). The surface CO2 fluxes at #0,
#2, and #3 points were measured by the closed chamber
method. The effect of spontaneous combustion in the goaf was investigated
by continuous monitoring of the soil surface CO2 flux.

Figure 3 Site maps
of measuring points and measuring instruments.

Furthermore, the short-term measurement of the CO2 concentration
versus the depth of the borehole at the #1 point was carried out using
the open measuring principle. The relationship between air leakage
into the goaf and CO2 flux changes was studied using the
SF6 laser leak detector (KARAT LLD-100) to verify the effect
of air leakage at the #3 point. SF6 as a tracer gas was
released continuously from the surface at the lower part of the open-pit
mine slope. The vertical distance from the monitoring point is 30
m, and the horizontal distance is 120 m. The locations of the releasing
and monitoring points are shown in Figure 4. To avoid the data contingency caused by
the single point measurement, two test points and two blank points
were selected to measure the SF6 concentration. The test
points I and II for the measurements were located over the fracture
zone, and the blank points (points III and IV) for measurements are
30 cm away from the test points. The SF6 concentrations
of the points were compared to verify the air leakage from the open-pit
mine slope.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 CO2 Emission Characteristics of
the Overlying Surface at the Normal Area
To investigate the
CO2 flux changes in the soil overlying the goaf, the CO2 flux at the normal area (#0 point) was measured as shown
in Figure 5. It was
observed that the CO2 flux of the #0 measuring point is
high in the daytime and low at night. The reason is basically consistent
with the change in soil temperature. The surface soil of the measurement
area is composed of sandstone and coal powder. The soil is relatively
dry, and there is no vegetation on the surface. The measured surface
CO2 flux between 0.1 and 0.2 μmol·m–2·s–1 is mainly emission from the respiration
of microorganisms in the soil. A low temperature inhibits soil microbial
respiration, and high soil moisture prevents the diffusion of CO2.16 Therefore, the lowest surface
flux emission in the daytime occurs around 6 a.m. with the lowest
temperature and relatively high humidity. In this monitoring area,
the soil is dry. Accordingly, the CO2 flux increased sharply
during the period of rainfall. According to the measurement results,
the appropriate rainfall will lead to a large increase in the surface
CO2 flux. This kind of increase does not occur immediately
but starts approximately 2 h after rainfall. This is a process in
which rainwater penetrates into the soil and causes decomposition
and buffering of the microorganisms and organic matter in the soil.
The elapsed time of the CO2 flux starts to rise up until
the peak value is about 3 h. With continuous rainfall, the soil water
content on the surface will inhibit CO2 emission.

Figure 5 Surface CO2 flux at the normal area during 1 week at
the #0 point.

3.2 Analysis
of Surface CO2 Flux over
Goaf
The CO2 fluxes measured at #2 and #3 points
are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.
The CO2 flux at the #2 point is about 0.25–1.25
μmol·m–2·s–1,
which is 5–10 times larger than that of the normal area (about
10% of #3 point test data). The goaf under the #2 point was created
about 30 years ago, and the surface has subsided due to free collapse.
The goaf is in a closed state and does not have coal spontaneous combustion;
therefore, the measured value of the surface flux is relatively low.

Figure 6 Tests
result of the #2 point (15 days).

Figure 7 Tests result of the #3 point (15 days).

The spontaneous combustion phenomenon in the goaf under the
#3
point is obvious. Due to the short distance, air leakage from the
slope to the goaf may induce residual coal spontaneous combustion.
The test results of the CO2 flux at the #3 point are shown
in Figure 7. The surface
CO2 flux range is 10–15 μmol·m–2·s–1. The variation of CO2 flux
is still correlated with the daily temperature changes, and the fluctuation
of CO2 flux is much larger than that of the normal area.
These results indicate that the daily variation of CO2 flux
is not only affected by the biological activity but also related to
the air leakage intensity caused by diurnal temperature differences.

Figure 8 shows the
temperature and CO2 flux curves of the day and night (24
h). It can be seen that the CO2 flux of the normal area
(#0 measuring point) has the same trend as the temperature changes
(see Figure 8a). The
CO2 flux increases with increasing atmospheric temperature.
However, Figure 8b,c
shows that the CO2 flux on the surface over the goaf is
negatively correlated with the atmospheric temperature. The #2 point
is located over the goaf but does not include the spontaneous combustion
of coal. However, the CO2 flux is still 5–10 times
larger than that of the normal area, indicating that, due to the influence
of internal and external temperatures and pressure differences, there
is still existing goaf CO2 continuous emission to the surface.
The mined-out area of this measuring point was created for a long
time and collapsed freely. The goaf interior is approximately confined,
the air leakage is weak, and the temperature is constant.

Figure 8 Curves of CO2 daily emission: (a) #0 point, (b) #2 point,
and (c) #3 point.

During the summer period,
the temperature difference between the
goaf and the outside reduces with increasing atmospheric temperature.
So, it weakens the diffusion of CO2 due to less buoyancy
force on the gas.17,18 Therefore, surface CO2 flux increases as the temperature decreases. CO2 emission
of the #3 point is significantly higher than that of the #2 point
and affected by the temperature change. The change in air leakage
intensity caused by the temperature difference has a significant effect
on the oxidation reaction of residual coal in the goaf and the gas
diffusion intensity from the goaf to the surface. These relations
indicate that the oxidizing reaction intensity of residual coal in
the goaf affects indirectly the value of surface soil CO2 flux.

3.3 Seasonal Changes in Surface CO2 Fluxes over Goaf
The surface soil CO2 emission
under different seasonal conditions is measured as shown in Figures 9 and 10. The same time period (9:00 a.m.
to 12:00 p.m. in sunny daytime), winter (December), and summer (July)
monitoring results were selected to compare the effect of season changes
on CO2 flux.

Figure 9 Monitoring results at the #2 point in summer.

Figure 10 Monitoring results at the #2 point in
winter.

The soil animals, plants, soil
microflora, and other soil organisms
show significant differences in the living conditions due to the temperature
difference between winter and summer (the average temperature difference
is about 40 °C). In summer, the measured CO2 flux
in the goaf-overlying surface contains both CO2 released
by soil fauna and soil microflora activities and the CO2 diffused from the goaf. However, in winter, the life activities
of surface soil fauna and microflora are almost stopped since the
atmospheric temperature drops below the freezing point. Based on this,
it has become apparent that the oxidation state of the underground
coal can be indirectly determined by monitoring the change in the
surface CO2 flux.

Due to the seasonal changes, the
fluctuation law of CO2 flux on the surface of the #2 point
shows quite different trends.
Comparing Figures 9 and 10 can conclude
that, in the same test period, the CO2 flux fluctuation
range is small, and the variation curve is relatively flat in summer;
however, the CO2 flux increases with temperature in winter.
In summer, the atmospheric temperature is high, and the metabolic
activities of soil animals, plants, soil microflora, and other soil
organisms in the surface soil are frequent. The slow oxidation stage
of the residual coal in the goaf accelerates the release of CO2; therefore, the total measured CO2 flux is relatively
high.19,20 Consequently, the measured CO2 flux is about 1 time larger than that in winter. However, during
the summer monitoring period, due to the small relative temperature
difference between the goaf and the outside, the surface CO2 flux varies slightly (as shown in Figure 9), which is not conducive to the diffusion
of CO2 to the surface. Therefore, when the temperature
is at the highest level, the change in surface CO2 flux
is not obvious. In winter tests, the measured CO2 flux
range is 0.2 to 0.3 μmol·m–2·s–1, much lower than the measured summer data. In a cold
environment, the soil fauna and soil microflora activities almost
stopped, and there is no extra CO2 emission. The measured
CO2 flux is only from the goaf diffusion. Additionally,
the #2 point underground goaf is closed; the temperature is higher
than that of the outside atmosphere, resulting in a large temperature
and pressure difference between the goaf and the outside, which accelerates
the CO2 release to the surface. So, the surface CO2 flux increased with increasing outside atmospheric temperature,
as shown in Figure 10. From the discussion, one may conclude that the difference in environmental
conditions such as temperature and soil characteristics is the main
reason for the different trends of CO2 flux on the surface
soil. By measuring the CO2 flux overlying the goaf, the
conditions of underground coal can be indirectly reflected, which
lays a data foundation for more accurately predicting and warning
the residual coal in the abandoned goaf and the spontaneous combustion
state of the shallow buried coal seam.

3.4 Tracer
Gas Measurement for Air Leakage Pass
To confirm the air leakage
to the goaf from the open-pit mine slope,
the tracer gas measurement was carried out. Before the release of
SF6, the background concentrations of the points (test
points I and II and blank test points III and IV) were determined.
After the values were stabilized, SF6 was continuously
released. The wind velocity is measured every 5 min. The change in
SF6 concentration and the distribution of wind velocity
are shown in Figures 11 and 12.

Figure 11 Relationship
between the SF6 concentration and wind
velocity at points I and II.

Figure 12 Relationship between the SF6 concentration and wind
velocity at points II and IV.

As shown in Figure 11, the measured SF6 background concentration is
in the
range of 5–18 ppb. The elapsed time of test point I that detected
the SF6 concentration rise was 50 min, and the peak value
reached 110 ppb. According to the measured wind velocity, the stronger
the wind velocity, the higher the measured SF6 concentration.
Since SF6 is released in the slope, to eliminate the influence
of diffusion in the atmosphere, the blank test point III is simultaneously
measured, and the concentration change is also illustrated in Figure 11. When moved to
the blank test point III, the concentration of SF6 instantaneously
drops below 18 ppb, returning to the background concentration measured
before release.

As can be seen from Figures 4 and 12, the
crack position at the test point II is relatively wide, and a peak
concentration value of 230 ppb appears when the wind velocity is up
to the maximum. When the wind velocity drops, the concentration value
also decreases. Finally, the SF6 concentration in the test
point II is stable at about 120 ppb. Once the monitoring probe to
the blank test point IV was moved, the SF6 concentration
drops below 18 ppb.

Combining the results of Figures 11 and 12, we can see that a certain concentration
of SF6 can be
detected at the surface crack of the goaf. The measured SF6 concentration is directly proportional to the wind velocity, indicating
that the goaf has air leakage in the slope and the stronger the wind
velocity, the more air leakage to the goaf. Air leakage promotes the
oxidation of residual coal in the goaf, which increases the concentration
of internal CO2 and speeds up its diffusion to the surface.
According to the comparative analysis of the measured results of test
points I and II and blank test points III and IV, it can be seen that
most of SF6 released from the slope penetrates into the
goaf with the air leakage. The surface cracks connect to the goaf,
and the air leakage on the slope promotes the CO2 emission
from the overlying surface.

3.5 Correlation Analysis of
Surface CO2 Emission and Goaf Spontaneous Combustion
To study the diffusion
process of CO2 from the goaf to the surface and fully understand
the variation of the underground CO2 concentration, the
emission characteristics of CO2 from the borehole connecting
to the goaf were measured by infrared gas monitoring equipment. In
the measurement, nine monitoring positions were set at the #1 point
(see Figure 2). Each
monitoring takes 6 min and operates 11 cycles throughout the day.

Summarizing the data measured in Figure 13, the CO2 concentration in the
borehole deeper part is higher than that in the upper part. However,
when H > 1 m, the CO2 concentration
almost
remains constant. Meanwhile, the larger the depth, the smaller the
fluctuation of the monitored CO2 concentration. According
to Fick’s law and the measured climate data, atmospheric temperature
is the most important reason for this phenomenon. Moreover, it also
points out that the CO2 concentration in the borehole below
1 m depth is not affected by changes in atmospheric temperature. The
measurement results indirectly prove the existence of CO2 diffusion from the goaf to the surface. When the region exceeds
2 m in depth, the CO2 concentration has a decreasing trend
with increasing depth, as shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13 Relationship of the CO2 concentration
and temperature
changes at different depths: (a) H = 0.4 m, (b) H = 0.6 m, (c) H = 0.8 m, (d) H = 1 m, (e) H = 2 m, (f) H = 3
m, and (g) H = 5 m.

The change in the CO2 concentration is positively
correlated
with the ambient temperature, as shown in Figure 13. The higher the ambient temperature, the
stronger the CO2 diffusion ability. Therefore, the existed
deeper part of CO2 in the wellbore is easier to diffuse
to the top area.

As shown in Figures 13 and 14, the
surface microbial activity is enhanced as the atmospheric temperature
increases. Due to the influence of air leakage from the open-pit slope
to the goaf, the surface CO2 flux increases. From the changes
in CO2 concentration in the borehole, it can be found that
with increasing temperature, a large fluctuation in the CO2 concentration was measured near the surface of the borehole (within
a depth of 1 m) due to the increase in CO2 emission. It
is important to point out that the atmospheric temperature and slope
leakage affect the goaf CO2 diffusion and promote the emission
of CO2 on the surface. Note that the concentration of CO2 in the H ≥ 3 m area becomes smaller.
Meanwhile, the CO2 concentration in the borehole is influenced
not only by the goaf but also the diffusion of the surrounding stratum.

Figure 14 Surface
CO2 flux curve.

The above preliminary analysis has provided important information
that there is a certain amount of CO2 in the upper stratum
and the CO2 diffusion from the goaf to the surface.

3.6 Surface Soil CO2 Fluxes Related
to Spontaneous Combustion in the Goaf
The coal mines have
(#3 point location area) already closed the mine shafts, roadways
around goafs 2 years ago. There is a smoking belt fissured from the
north to the south on the surface. Therefore, air leakage from the
slope surface provides oxygen to residual coal in the goaf and may
induce spontaneous combustion in the goaf.

As shown in Figure 15, the value of
CO2 flux at the #3 point overlying the goaf is roughly
10 times larger than that of the #2 point on the normal soil surface
due to spontaneous combustion of the residual coal. We expect that
the main environmental and topographic factors to induce spontaneous
combustion at the goaf are atmospheric temperature, wind velocity,
and wind direction at the pit slope surface.

Figure 15 Relationship between
the CO2 flux and temperature at
the #3 point.

According to the environmental
monitoring data at the site, the
influence of wind velocity on the surface CO2 flux over
the goaf is discussed, because the wind direction of the monitoring
area is mainly west wind. Figure 16 shows the relation between the wind velocity and surface
soil CO2 flux. The trend of CO2 flux is sensitive
to the wind velocity. The reason may be that the goaf air leakage
induces with increasing wind velocity, and it promotes the coal oxidation
and producing CO2 gas. This phenomenon is attributed to
the increase in the surface CO2 flux.

Figure 16 Relationship between
the CO2 flux and wind velocity
at the #3 point.

Figures 17 and 18 show the
relationships between the goaf surface
soil CO2 flux, temperature, and wind velocity for V ≤ 2 m·s–1 and V > 2 m·s–1, respectively. Under the influence
of the air leakage from the slope and the temperature difference between
the goaf and the outside, the wind speed and the atmospheric temperature
dominate the fluctuation of the surface CO2 flux. When
the wind speed is less than 2 m·s–1, the temperature
plays a leading role. When the wind speed is higher than 2 m·s–1, the wind speed dominates the fluctuation of the
CO2 flux. Accordingly, the correlation between the surface
soil CO2 flux and the temperature on V > 2 m·s–1 is more sensitive to the wind
velocity
than that of V ≤ 2 m·s–1.

and wind velocity at the #3 point (V ≤ 2 m·s–1): (a) surface CO2 flux versus temperature

4 Conclusions
In this study, the CO2 concentration in the borehole
connected to the goaf and CO2 flux in the soil surface
was carried out to investigate the influence of abandoned coal mine
goaf CO2 on the surface environment. The present study
is summarized as follows:1. The surface CO2 flux over
the goaf is obviously higher than that of the normal area. The measured
CO2 flux over the goaf is mainly provided from the oxidation
reaction of residual coal. The present measurement results are useful
for early warning to prevent hazards related to spontaneous combustion
in the goaf or shallow coal seams.

2. Both surface CO2 fluxes
over the goaf and the normal area are affected by the soil characteristics
and atmospheric temperature. However, the CO2 flux in the
normal area increases with increasing atmospheric temperature, while
the CO2 flux over the goaf decreases with increasing atmospheric
temperature.

3. The CO2 concentration in
the borehole is basically constant when the depth is higher than 1
m. The difference in the concentration at different depths indicates
the presence of CO2 diffusion in the stratum.

4. The tracer gas method proved the air
leakage in the goaf. The air leakage intensity is proportional to
the magnitude of wind velocity. It was found that the fracture in
the area of the #3 point is connected to the goaf. The air leakage
from the open-pit slope was expected to promote the surface CO2 emission over the goaf.
