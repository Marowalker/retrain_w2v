Hybrid nanoarchitectures of AgInS2 and TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared by using a modified sol–gel
method. The experimental results reveal that these nanocomposites
display enhanced visible light absorption and effective charge carrier
separation compared to their pristine parent samples (AgInS2 or TiO2). 0.5 wt % AgInS2 loading was found
to be the optimum concentration for photocatalytic applications. More
than 95% of doxycycline degradation was achieved within 180 min of
solar light illumination. Similarly, the dopant concentrations at
lower values (<2 wt %) exhibited 300 times higher H2 generation rate under visible light irradiation compared to AgInS2 and TiO2. The microbial strains (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
aureus) exhibited a 99.999% reduction within half
an hour of simulated solar light illumination. The computational investigation
was employed to understand the structural, electronic, and the dielectric
properties of AgInS2 and TiO2 composites. The
improved photocatalytic results are explained as a result of the decreased
rate of exciton recombination. The current investigation opens up
new insights into the use of novel ternary heterostructure nanocomposites
for improved visible light activity.

1 Introduction
Fossil fuels such as coal
and natural gases have been the mainstay
for the industrialized world for the past century.1,2 However,
their rapid depletion and ever-increasing demand raise some grave
challenges.3,4 Rising global temperature and population
are the key elements of concern in relation to energy shortage and
environmental pollution.5,6 Hydrogen is considered
as the fuel for the 21’st century.7−9 However, processes
such as steam reforming utilizing coal are still the major route to
generate H2.10−13 Similarly, the water plants across different cities
around the globe utilize the conventional route of adsorption, sedimentation,
and flocculation as secondary water treatment protocols.14,15 This results in the disposal of untreated hostile effluents to the
ecosystem, which further leads to channelization to a higher order
of the food chain via biomagnification.16,17 The lack of
cost-effective and sustainable technologies has been a challenge for
this region.14,15 Nevertheless, sustainable technologies
such as solar and wind energy have emerged to be efficient alternatives
for modern civilization.18,19 Among the various sustainable
technologies, photocatalysis is identified as one of the long-term,
stable, environmentally friendly alternative, to produce green energy
and environmental remediation.4,20−23 Semiconductor-based heterogeneous photocatalysis has the ability
to utilize solar energy to convert and store into other renewable
forms of energy, chemical fuels, degradation of harmful effluents,
and even disinfection of microorganisms.24−28 A photocatalytic process is defined by five basic
steps: (1) Absorption of light on the semiconductor surface, (2) creation
of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, (3) migration of these
excitons or recombination, (4) adsorption of reactants and the desorption
of the products, and (5) completion of redox reactions on the photocatalytic
surface.29−31 Thus, finding light-absorbing materials with semiconducting
properties is not enough, but tailoring the design to effectively
enhance the interfacial charge transfer and decreasing the rate of
recombination is the key attribute. Various procedures such as band
gap modulation, defect formation, dimensionality alteration, pore
texture alteration, surface sensitization, heterojunction creation,
etc. are attempted to reduce the recombination rate and enhance the
visible light absorption.24,29

Titania is a
traditional semiconductor material, which garnered
significant attention in 1972 when Honda and Fujishima demonstrated
its use in the electrochemical water splitting reaction to produce
hydrogen.32,33 Apart from the key properties, there exist
major drawbacks such as low visible light absorption and wide band
gap.18,34,35 However, heterostructure
formation of titania with other semiconductor materials has pushed
them back into the spotlight. Ternary chalcogenides are another class
of multicomponent elements, which have attracted attention for their
small band gap and excellent photon absorption in the visible region
of the electromagnetic spectrum.25,36 These attractive
multielement structures have been in the research realm for the past
3 decades, but their utilization as a possible heterostructure component
for photocatalytic applications is still underexploited. Although
copper-based ternary compounds have recently been explored for several
photocatalytic applications such as degradation of emerging pollutants,
real wastewater treatments, CO2 reduction, and energy generation,37−40 silver-based ternary compounds as a potential heterostructure component
are yet to be studied and there exists enough opportunity to explore.

Amid all, AgInS2(I-III-VI), a ternary semiconductor,
crystallizes into two different polymorphs; a room-temperature stable
tetragonal chalcopyrite structure and the other high-temperature orthorhombic
wurtzite structure.41 The phase transition
occurs at 620 °C, and these nanocrystals are known to be synthesized
using different liquid-phase reactions.42−45 The orthorhombic AgInS2 has been reported for various photocatalytic applications.46 The small band gap and excellent photon absorption
in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum aid in several
efficient processes. Nevertheless, these materials display reduced
quantum efficiency and strong light etching that confines its significant
application.47 Yin and Cui et al. reported
the synthesis of AgInS2 nanoparticle-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays and AgInS2 cluster films on the
TiO2/FTO substrate, respectively. These composites were
investigated for their photoelectrochemical properties.48,49 Similarly, Liu et al. effectively studied the same composite and
illustrated the degradation of 1,2 dichlorobenzene.47 Similar heterostructural composites such as AgBiS2-TiO2 were also previously reported.50 However, there still exists significant potential of these
materials for their various functional applications, which remains
unexplored. Studies of these composites for photocatalytic hydrogen
production, doxycycline (DC) degradation, and antibacterial disinfection
have not yet been reported.

Hence, in the current investigation,
we outline the optimal solvothermal
synthesis parameters of AgInS2 and developed a staggered
heterostructure composite of TiO2 at different wt % (0.5,
1, 2, and 5). These as-prepared composites illustrate positive heterostructure
formation in the Raman and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
results. Moreover, the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(UV-DRS) spectra illustrate the enhanced visible light absorption
by the composite samples. The decreased band gap of the material enabled
in illustrating 300 times enhanced hydrogen output, 5-log bacterial
inactivation within 30 min of illumination, and more than 95% degradation
of doxycycline (DC) within 3 h of irradiation. The introduction of
even a low dopant ratio of AgInS2 effectually harnessed
the efficiency of the incoming light and decreased the recombination
rate. A plausible photocatalytic mechanism and the interfacial charge
transfer are discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Computational Results
In this section,
computational results concerning the structural properties, the electronic
structure, the projected density of states (PDOS), and dielectric
properties of TiO2 and AgInS2 are presented.
This helped to understand the underlying photocatalytic mechanism.
The initial structures of TiO2 and AgInS2 were
obtained from the Materials Project library. The initial geometry
of AgInS2 had the lattice constants a =
6.81 Å, b = 7.15 Å, c =
8.35 Å, and the angles were α = β = γ = 90°.
After the structural optimization, there were no changes in the lattice
angles, but the lattice constants slightly changed upon volume relaxation
to a = 6.75 Å, b = 7.05 Å,
and c = 8.25 Å. The volume was relaxed by 3.5%
in the case of orthorhombic AgInS2. The X-ray diffractogram
(XRD) pattern of the orthorhombic phase of AgInS2 obtained
theoretically is also given in Figure S1. Both the Ag and In cations have tetrahedral coordination with S.
The AgS4 and InS4 tetrahedra are connected to
one another at the corners (see polygons diagrams in Figure 1).

crystal structure of AgInS2. Color code: gray = Ag, light
red = In, and red = S.

TiO2, on the other hand, had lattice
constants a = b = 10.16 Å and c = 2.96 Å and the lattice angles α = β
= γ
= 90° at the end of the geometry relaxation where the volume
was reduced by 3.77% from the initial structure. The initial structure
of TiO2 had the lattice parameters a = b = 10.32 Å and c = 2.98 Å and
angles α = β = γ = 90°. The Ti cations and
O anions are connected to each other in an octahedral coordination.
Alternate edge and corner sharing connect these octahedra to each
other, as seen in Figure 2.

phase. Color code: blue = Ti and red = O.

There is an underestimation in the band gap value
with respect
to the experimentally observed value even though the computed lattice
parameters fall within a 1% error with respect to the experimental
ones. This is not unexpected as the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) functional used is well-known to underestimate the band gap.54 In the calculation of the band structure, the
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional under GGA was
used owing to its computational speed. This functional is known to
contain unphysical Coulomb repulsion, which leads to a poor description
of the band gap.51,52 There are works that report the
PBE band gap of well-known compounds, which are shown to underestimate
the experimentally observed band gap.3 In
fact, there are many insulators (nonzero band gap) such as FeO and
GaSb that were estimated as metals (zero band gap) upon the usage
of PBE functional.53 The band structure
of AgInS2 is presented in Figure 3a and shows a direct band gap of ∼0.5
eV. Both the valence band maxima (VBM) and the conduction band minima
(CBM) lie on the Γ point in the Brillouin zone. The upper valence
band (UVB) is dominated by S p-orbitals and Ag d-orbitals and the
lower conduction band (LCB) by the In s-orbitals and S p-orbitals.
Energy larger than the computed band gap value is expected for the
electrons to transfer from VB to CB due to the p–p forbidden
transitions. In the current work, the experimentally observed band
gap of AgInS2 is 1.95 eV (Figure 11b), and the PBE band gap is 0.5 eV, which
is within an error of 74.36%. The band structure and partial density
of state (PDOS) plots were only used as a tool to illustrate the orbital
occupancies near the band edges.

Figure 3 Calculated band structure of (a) AgInS2 and (b) TiO2 with the corresponding PDOS. The
top of the valence band
(horizontal line) is aligned at 0 eV.

TiO2, on the other hand, is an indirect
band gap material
with a band gap of ∼2.7 eV. The band structure and the PDOS
of TiO2 are shown in Figure 3b. The VBM lie between Z and P points, and the CBM lie between the Γ and X points of the Brillouin zone. The O p-states dominate
the UVB, and the Ti d-states dominate the LCB. The Ti p-states were
also present at the UVB of TiO2.

Absorption spectra
for AgInS2 and TiO2 are
calculated in the independent particle approximation and plotted in Figure 4 in the range of
0–7.5 eV input light. The first peak of the imaginary part
of the dielectric function, which indicates the energy value at which
the actual electron transition starts, of AgInS2 and TiO2, was found to be 2.04 and 3.43 eV, respectively.55 AgInS2 is optically anisotropic,
but along the x- and y-directions, the light absorption spectrum is
isotropic for TiO2.

Figure 4 Imaginary part of the dielectric function
(Im(ε)) of (a)
TiO2- and (b) AgInS2-calculated infrared, visible,
and ultraviolet regions.

The band gap and the optimized crystal structure
of AgInS2 in the tetragonal phase were also calculated
(Figure S2).The geometry was obtained from
the Materials Project
library with the lattice parameters a = b = 5.93 Å and c = 11.52 Å and the angles
α = β = γ = 90°. After relaxation, the volume
of the cell was reduced by 3.3% and the lattice constants were obtained
as a = b = 5.85 Å and c = 11.42 Å without changing its angles. The band gap
of AgInS2 in the tetragonal phase was found to be 0.36
eV. The crystal structure of AgInS2 attained via experimental
synthesis exists in an orthorhombic phase, hence the computational
conclusions drawn for the orthorhombic phase is discussed hereafter,
except otherwise identified.

2.2 Synthesis and Crystal Structure
The
synthesis process of AgInS2–TiO2 is illustrated
in Figure 5. Typically,
the TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by the sol–gel method
undergo solvothermal process resulting in the in situ formation of
the AgInS2 nanoparticles.47 This
results in a uniform distribution of the dopant particles and formation
of close intimate heterojunctions as discussed in the latter sections.
The challenges of synthesizing these semiconductor nanostructures
are their stability, controlling the stoichiometric composition, and
the crystal structure.37,38,56 As similar to other bulk materials, the nanoparticles of the ternary
compounds exhibit interesting electronic and optical properties compared
to their bulk counterparts.57 The formation
of the low-temperature stable orthorhombic structure of AgInS2 could be ascribed to the solvent picked for the reaction
and the balanced use of the two cationic precursors used in the synthesis
process. The appropriate reaction temperature and time aid in tuning
the reactivity of Ag and In precursors (as observed in the diffractograms
of time and temperature studies of AgInS2). As Ag+ is a soft Lewis acid, therefore appropriate Lewis base such as ethanolamine
(EA) is used as a suitable ligand required for the complexation process.
Moreover, the presence of lone nitrogen chelating atom on an amine
molecule makes EA, a potential structure forming mediator.58,59

Figure 5 Schematic
illustration of the synthesis mechanism of AgInS2–TiO2 composites.

The formation of AgInS2 nanoparticles
using a solvothermal
technique could be explained as follows 1   2  At the beginning of the reaction, the Ag+ and In3+ ions form covalent complexes as given
above (where x and y are positive
integers), due to the use of EA as a solvent.60,61 Additionally, these complexes react with thiourea (TH) resulting
in the formation of complexes as 3   4  The formation of any free radicals of S2– from thiourea is proposed to be prevented to some
extent, due to the use of EA as a solvent. This mechanism averts the
creation of any additional binary impurity phases, for example, In2S3 or Ag2S. The stability of thiourea
falls on enhancing the temperature and eventually results in the formation
of more stable ternary chalcogenide phase to yield AgInS2. Meanwhile, the thiourea in the reaction plays a dual nature partly
by aiding in the formation of a complex and also as a source of sulfur
other than thiourea.62,63 5  The structure and the crystallinity of the
as-synthesized AgInS2–TiO2 composites
were investigated using X-ray diffractogram (XRD). Figure 6 displays the formation of
the as-prepared AgInS2 and AgInS2–TiO2 composites. Orthorhombic phase of AgInS2 [a = 7.00 Å, b = 8.28 Å, c = 6.69 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°]
with peaks defining at 24.90, 25.40, 26.80, 28.50, 36.70, 43.67, 44.78,
48.23, and 51.80° owing to (120), (200), (002), (121), (122),
(040), (320), (203), and (042), respectively, is observed [JCPDS -00-025-1328].46 The XRD peak intensity at 26.8° of the
(002) plane shows a higher intensity. Although, the primary peak in
the given case might reflect the formation of the tetragonal phase.
However, the presence of prominent peaks at 24.9, 25.4, and 28.5°
prove otherwise. The tetragonal phase of AgInS2 does not
exhibit any peaks at <26° (2⊖ value). The slightly
widened peaks could be attributed to the decreased nanocrystal size
as observed in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 15) and also observed
in the previous reports.64−66 Moreover, the Raman results aid
in confirming the orthorhombic phase as the peaks at 264 and 316 cm–1 correspond to the orthorhombic wurtzite structure,
while the peaks of the tetragonal phase only appear at 240 and 345
cm–1, which are absent in this case (the inset of Figure 12).43,46,67,68

The diffractograms in Figure 7 compare the as-synthesized AgInS2 with
other peaks of Ag2S [JCPDS 00-014-0072], In2S3 [JCPDS 00-033-0624], AgIn5S8 [JCPDS
00-026-1477], and AgInS2 tetragonal [JCPDS 00-025-1330].
It displays the orthorhombic AgInS2 formation, deprived
of any impurity.

peaks
of AgInS2 orthorhombic, AgInS2 tetragonal, Ag2S, and In2S3.

The temperature and time studies were accomplished,
with the purpose
of optimizing the reaction parameters for solvothermal synthesis. Figure 8a illustrates the
temperature study of AgInS2 at altered temperatures (150–250
°C) for 12 h. The crystallinity of the sample increases with
the rise in temperature from 150 to 180 °C (the peak observed
at 26.80°). The intensity of the identical peak declines on increasing
the temperatures after 200–250 °C. Therefore, 180 °C
was applied as an ideal temperature for further assessing the time
period for this solvothermal synthesis. Figure 8b exhibits the outcome of time study, which
demonstrates the surge in the crystallinity of the peak at 26.10°
on enhancing the time duration from 6 h to 12 h. The intensity of
the peak at 26.80° decreases on assessment up to 72 h of the
synthesis period. Therefore, 180 °C for 12 h is reflected as
the optimum solvothermal parameters for AgInS2.

Figure 8 (a) Temperature
and (b) time studies of AgInS2 solvothermal
synthesis.

Figure 6 also exhibits
the diffractograms of TiO2 and its composites with AgInS2. Peaks corresponding to AgInS2 are not observed
in the current diffractogram, which is endorsed to the high crystallinity
of the TiO2 nanoparticles and the small doping amount of
AgInS2. Sharp peaks of TiO2 [a = b = 3.78 Å and c = 9.50
Å] at 25.40, 38.50, 48.00, and 55.00° to (101), (112), (200),
and (211) correspondingly are likewise displayed in the diffractogram.69,70

The composite structures as exhibited in Figure 6 neither showed any change
in crystallinity
nor there is any indication of rutilation (impurity phase) of TiO2. Moreover, the lattice constant acquired for the bare samples
presented a decent agreement to the computationally obtained values.
The 0.5 wt % AgInS2–TiO2 composites demonstrated
the top photocatalytic outcomes (as shown in the latter segments)
amid their parent and other dopant % samples. Therefore, henceforward,
it is used for additional characterizations except otherwise identified.

2.3 Optical Properties
To examine the
optical absorption behavior of the as-synthesized materials, UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra were employed. Figure 9 shows the diffused
reflectance spectra of titania and AgInS2–TiO2 composites. TiO2 exhibits a maximum at 350 nm
(UV region), which corroborates the computationally obtained first
peak of the imaginary part of the dielectric spectra at 3.8 eV. A substantial improvement in the absorption in the visible region
is detected in AgInS2–TiO2 materials.70 The composite samples exhibited the signature
sharp hump of TiO2 at 380 nm; however, the absorption edge
is extended up to 800 nm.

Figure 9 DRS spectra of TiO2 and AgInS2–TiO2 composites.

The indirect band gap measurements of the composite
samples and
titania are assessed, as shown in Figure 10. Thus, this substantiates the results computed
theoretically (Figures 3b and 4a). The composite samples show a decreased
band gap value with an increase in the AgInS2 content.
This effectively proves the successful doping of the sample and the
formation of the heterostructure.47

Figure 10 Band gap
estimation of titania and AgInS2–TiO2 composites.

Figure 11a illustrates the DRS spectra of AgInS2,
it shows an enhanced visible light absorption, and the edge extending
up to 800 nm. The corresponding band gap is also calculated and shown
in Figure 11b. As
observed through the absorption spectra, a high visible light absorption
resulted in a small band gap of 1.95 eV, which is consistent with
the theoretically computed results as discussed in an earlier section
(Figures 3a and 4b). The first peak of the imaginary part of the
dielectric spectra obtained at 2.04 eV restates the experimental findings
of absorption maxima observed at 600 nm (Figure 4b).

Figure 11 (a) DRS spectra of AgInS2. (b) Band
gap estimation of
AgInS2.

The Raman analyses of titania, AgInS2, and AgInS2–TiO2 are illustrated in Figure 12. Characteristic vibrational peaks of the wurtzite structure
of AgInS2 are observed at 264 and 316 cm–1 (as shown in the inset).43,46 Apart from that, characteristic
bands for titania are detected at 147, 197, 396, 516, and 638 cm–1 for A1g, 2B1g, and 3Eg correspondingly attributed to the anatase phase.69,71

Figure 12 Raman analyses of AgInS2, TiO2, and AgInS2–TiO2 composites.

Sharp and symmetric peaks of anatase appear in
the case of the
composite sample and a red shift is also detected for the composite
maxima (as specified in the inset of Figure 12), and this successfully proves the efficient
doping of the TC atoms into the TiO2 host material. Moreover,
the Raman spectra of the composite do not show the existence of any
other impurity peaks, which corroborates to the inferences observed
in XRD.72,73

The recombination rate of the solar
light-generated electron–hole
pair is evaluated using the photoluminescence (PL) measurement. The
PL spectra of AgInS2–TiO2 and TiO2 are displayed in Figure 13 (mass normalized). The emission peak intensity of
AgInS2–TiO2 is reduced compared to TiO2. The lesser PL intensity specifies the poor rate of recombination
of electron–hole pairs. This suggests that the introduction
of AgInS2 results to retardation in the recombination rate
of the excitons, which overwhelmingly improves the photocatalytic
efficiency.

2.4 Chemical Composition Analysis
The
chemical environment and the bonding characteristics are analyzed
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectra exhibit
the presence of Ti 2p and O 1s in spectra of TiO2. Peaks
of Ti 2p, O 1s, Ag 2d, In 3d, and S 2p were observed for AgInS2–TiO2 composites. Very low intensity peaks
of C 1s and N 1s are also detected among all of the materials, which
might be acquired through the experimental or analysis procedure. Figure 14A illustrates the
Ti 2p spectra of titania (a) and the composite of AgInS2–TiO2 (b).

Figure 14 High-resolution deconvoluted spectra
of (A) Ti 2p (a) titania and
(b) AgInS2–TiO2; (B) O 1s (a) TiO2 and (b) AgInS2–TiO2; (C) Ag
3d (a) AgInS2 and (b) AgInS2–TiO2; (D) In 3d (a) AgInS2 and (b) AgInS2–TiO2; and (E) S 2p (a) AgInS2 and (b)
AgInS2–TiO2.

Peaks of Ti 2p3/2 are observed at 457.8
eV, assigned
to Ti+4. The Ti 2p peaks remained unaltered in both cases.
Moreover, the O 1s spectra illustrated in Figure 14B show no change in the values of 528.59
and 530.40 eV consistent to crystal lattice oxygen of (O–Ti4+) and adsorbed O2 molecules correspondingly in
TiO2 (a) and AgInS2–TiO2 (b)
samples.33,74,75 The Ag 3d
high-resolution spectra for both AgInS2 (a) and AgInS2–TiO2 structure (b) are displayed in Figure 14C.

The signature
points of Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 are detected
at 372.73 and 366.72 eV correspondingly for the AgInS2 sample.76,77 The peak shifts slightly to 372.1
and 366.1 eV for the AgInS2–TiO2 sample.44 Nevertheless, the doublet separation of the
Ag 3d oxidation state remained unaltered (6 eV).78 A similar shift in peaks is observed for In 3d peaks at
451.52 and 443.97 eV corresponding to In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2, respectively, to 451.24 and 443.63 eV for AgInS2–TiO2 (Figure 14D). The doublet separation of 7.55 eV was observed
for the In 3d peaks, consistent with the previous literature.79Figure 14E illustrates the high-resolution spectra of S 2p. Peaks at
161.41 and 160.26 eV correspond to the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 are observed for AgInS2 samples (doublet splitting
of 1.15 eV).80 Apparently, significant
peaks of sulfur were not detectable in that same region; however,
broad peak around 161.4 eV is noticed. The peak location of all of
the elements is summarized in Table S2.

Thus, the effective interaction amid the heterostructure elements
results in the rise in electron concentration, which leads to the
interfacial charge transfer causing the shift of the peak detected.
The effective electron screening results in the increase in electron
concentration leading to a decrease in binding energy.81−84

2.5 Morphological and Microstructure Analysis
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is employed to evaluate
the morphology and microstructure of the samples prepared. The TEM
of titania and its selected area diffraction pattern is demonstrated
in Figure 15a. The nanoparticles exhibited ovular features, and
the typical size was observed to be around 25–40 nm. The interplanar
spacing (d) values obtained for diverse areas of
the image confirm the formation of the anatase phase of the nanoparticles.85Figure 15b illustrates the TEM image of pristine orthorhombic AgInS2. The nanoparticles likewise displayed ovular nature, and
the clear lattice fringes were identified of (002) and (121) planes
with respective interplanar spacing values of 0.314 and 0.176 nm are
observed.

AgInS2–TiO2.

In the meantime, Figure 15c,d shows the TEM images of AgInS2–TiO2 composites. The presence of asymmetric particles
identified
as AgInS2 in TiO2 is observed. However, the
existence of the nanoparticles demonstrates that both AgInS2 result in intimate integration with the TiO2 nanoparticles,
and thus result in the formation of the heterostructure.47,86 High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the composites are further
provided in Figure 16.

2.6 Photocatalytic Applications
2.6.1 Photodegradation
Pharmaceutical
effluent has grown to be a major contaminant source in rivers and
groundwater. The rise in contamination shall result in the growth
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the water bodies. Hence, effective
secondary wastewater treatment has resulted to be an imperative solution
to this crisis. Photocatalysis is an excellent alternative, and hence
in this study, doxycycline (DC) is used as a modal antibiotic to assess
the photocatalytic efficiency of AgInS2–TiO2. The photocatalytic trials were done under dark and solar
light illumination correspondingly.87Figure 17 demonstrates the
degradation pattern of AgInS2–TiO2 materials
by presenting the variation in DC amount (in concentration) with time
[C/C0 % vs time]. As
illustrated in Figure 18, the pristine parent and the composite sample displayed no adsorption
activity. Moreover, the DC solution (blank sample) exposed under the
same condition did not report any change in the profile and thus nullified
any possibility of photodecomposition.

of DC with time with TiO2, AgInS2, and AgInS2–TiO2 composites.

of 0.5 wt % AgInS2–TiO2.

Under visible light irradiation, the AgInS2–TiO2 composites exhibit remarkable photocatalytic
efficacy as
compared to the TiO2 and AgInS2 exposed under
the same condition. The pristine TiO2 and AgInS2 presented the least activity compared to the composite samples.
The AgInS2, even though having a lower band gap value,
is not sufficient to display enhanced results. This might be ascribed
to the higher recombination of the photogenerated excitons (e–h
pairs). Although all of the composites unveiled remarkable degradation
profiles, the 0.5 wt % material showed the best and the 5 wt % of
AgInS2–TiO2 composite presented the lowest
activity within 180 min of irradiation. Henceforth, it could be said that the composites display the best
outcomes simply at lesser addant ratios. These effects might be additionally
confirmed by the hydrogen generation outcomes as conferred in the
later section.

So, as to assess the reusability competence of
the materials, the
used sample was washed, dried, and reused after every single photocatalytic
study. The C/C0 % vs
time graph of 0.5 wt % AgInS2–TiO2 is
illustrated in Figure 18a. The degradation profile remained unaltered even after 4 cyclic
runs, and this illustrates the efficiency and the stability of the
catalyst prepared. The scavenging experiment was also completed to
clarify the contribution of the potential reactive oxygen species
associated with the degradation phenomenon. Scavenger chemicals, AgNO3, triethanolamine, benzoquinone (BQ), and isopropyl alcohol
(IPA), were added to the degradation system. As observed in Figure 18b, it compares
the degradation profiles of 0.5 wt % AgInS2–TiO2 with the 4 sets of systems in the reaction mixture on irradiated,
under the same irradiation condition. The decrease in the activity
was considerably altered on the introduction of silver nitrate and
BQ. Thus, electrons and holes are observed to be the major active
entities in the reaction mixture. Moreover, the IPA-added reaction
mixture also exhibited a nominal decrease, which outwardly demonstrates
that hydroxyl radicals are not the key players in the photocatalytic
activity. Therefore, electron and holes might be established as the
key reactive oxygen elements for AgInS2–TiO2. Moreover, Liu et al. and Zhang et al. studied AgInS2–TiO2 for various applications. They verified
the results of the scavenging experiments by the electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) technique. The composite samples did not display any
signal under dark, while on light irradiation, the AgInS2–TiO2 displayed four peak intensities for DMPO-O2*. The DMPO-OH– exhibits a very weak signal
intensity, hence substantiating to the results observed in the scavenging
experiments.47,88 Nevertheless, earlier results
of EPR on TiO2 and AgInS2 parent samples indicate
the formation of superoxide radicals. He et al. studied the major
reactive species generated on visible light irradiation on AgInS2 nanoparticles.89 Weak signals
of hydroxyl and singlet oxygen were observed; however, superoxide
radicals exhibited strong signals, which concluded it as the major
species in the study. Similarly, anatase TiO2 illustrates
weak signals for hydroxyl and singlet oxygen for UV light irradiation,
and strong peaks were observed for superoxide radicals. The visible
light illumination also left weak signals for all of the three major
species.90,91

The gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry and high-performance
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry are utilized to identify
the polar and nonpolar intermediates generated in the photocatalytic
degradation process.92 The chromatograms
observed aid to define the possible degradation pathway of the pollutant.
Zhu et al. define a plausible degradation pathway, as illustrated
in Figure 19.92 The holes generated in the process accept electrons
from the pollutant molecules and result in the formation of intermediate
products. In the very initiation of the process, DC molecules change
from a m/z ratio of 445 to m/z of 431 by losing an N-methyl group
and resulting in formation of anionic species. Additional degradation
leads to generation of intermediates at m/z 400. A continuous light exposure results in further mineralization
resulting in the complete disintegration of the DC molecule. The resulting
disintegrated smaller parts of the complex structure undergo additional
oxidation and lead to generation of smaller organic molecules such
as acids and alcohols.92−94

2.6.2 Photocatalytic H2 Production
With the aim of evaluating the photocatalytic competence, the synthesized
composites of AgInS2 were investigated for H2 generation. Visible light-induced water splitting and photoreforming
of organic species in aqueous solution have been considered as crucial
processes to convert solar to chemical energy. The use of sacrificial
organic agents helps to obtain higher photoefficiency due to the oxidation
of organic species by photogenerated positive holes, with the simultaneous
production of H+ ions. Photogenerated electrons on the
surface of the catalyst encounter with hydrogen ions to produce hydrogen
gas. Therefore, merging organic wastewater supervision and H2 generation via sunlight might be an encouraging sustainable approach
to tackle environmental and energy issues.

The H2 generation rate of AgInS2–TiO2-synthesized
materials together with their bare samples (AgInS2 and
TiO2) was measured. Methanol ([CH3OH] = 10 vol
%) as a sacrificial agent was utilized in this experimental process.
As shown in Figure 20a, the catalysts tested show appreciable hydrogen production for
0.5, 1, and 2 wt % for all over the photocatalytic runs. The composite
at low dopant % exhibited H2 output as high as 310 μmol/min.
On the contrary, the parent pristine samples (AgInS2 and
TiO2) showed 0 μmol/min. The composite structure
exhibits efficient output at lower wt % (up to 2); on increasing the
dopant value to 5 wt %, the photocatalytic efficiency decreases. With
respect to the starting pH values of the solution, no noteworthy variations
have been logged for the AgInS2–TiO2 composite
materials during the illumination duration (Figure 20b).

Figure 20 (a) Rate of hydrogen generation and (b)
influence of the pH of
the solution at different doping percentage of AgInS2–TiO2. [CH3OH] = 10 vol %; sample added = 500 mg/L at
RTP.

The illumination measures recorded in the ultraviolet
and visible
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum on the exterior surface of
the apparatus for various AgInS2–TiO2 samples tested are reported in Figure 21a,b, respectively.

Figure 21 Illumination recorded
at the exterior of the reactor walls amid
(a) 315–400 nm and (b) 400–1100 nm at different doping
ratios of AgInS2–TiO2 samples. [CH3OH] = 10 vol %; sample added = 500 mg/L at RTP.

Subsequently, eliminating the ultraviolet A filter,
a prompt surge
to the UV illuminance measure has been logged. The higher illuminance
values herein logged for the AgInS2 material indicating
a lesser suspension absorption, thus resulting in the absence of photocatalytic
hydrogen generation. The illumination measures obtained from the outer
walls of the reactor did not exhibit any prominent alteration at the
visible region. On comparing the irradiance values with hydrogen production
rates in the visible region for samples with different composition
in weight percentage, it can be stated that higher radiation absorption
values (i.e., lower irradiance values recorded on the photoreactor
walls) result in slightly improved hydrogen generation rates. In accordance
with pecking order of irradiance values in the visible region, the
photocatalytic activity had the following sequence: 2% AgInS2–TiO2 > 1% AgInS2–TiO2 ≈ 0.5% AgInS2–TiO2 ≫
5% AgInS2–TiO2.

2.6.3 Photocatalytic Antimicrobial Studies
The photocatalytic efficacy of AgInS2–TiO2 samples with their pristine parent samples was also studied by light-induced
microbial disinfection using a suspension test. A sample mixture with
the bacterial inoculate and catalyst was placed under both dark and
light environments, respectively.

Additionally, bare materials
(only with microbial strains) were too illuminated devoid of the presence
of any sample. On irradiating bacterial cells under visible light
by catalysts, these displayed higher photocatalytic proficiency by
the AgInS2–TiO2 samples compared to their
parent materials. More than a 5-log decrease was achieved in 30 min
of illumination for AgInS2–TiO2 (Figure 22).

Figure 22 Log reduction of microbial
strains with AgInS2, titania,
and AgInS2–TiO2 on 30 min of light irradiation.

The development of the 2 strains was constant in
light and dark
environments devoid of the presence of any photocatalysts. The bacterial
progression of the AgInS2 parent sample displayed a complete
antibacterial efficiency only after 80 min. In the case of pristine
TiO2, the total bacterial inactivation for both the strains
was reached only after 60 min of light illumination.

The pictures
of agar plates with bacteriological clusters at different
periods for AgInS2–TiO2 are given in Figure 23. All of the composite
samples were more active than their parent samples. This could be
attributed to the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of the composite
sample. None of the test samples showed any bacterial disinfection
property under dark conditions.

of (a) Escherichia
coli colonies and (b) Staphylococcus
aureus colonies on agar plates at different periods
using AgInS2–TiO2.

2.7 Photocatalytic Mechanism
The composite
design of AgInS2 using TiO2 displayed remarkable
photocatalytic performance when equated to their bare materials. The
computational results of the electronic and optical properties of
AgInS2 and TiO2 helped in corroborating with
the experimentally obtained orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, respectively.
Additionally, the band structure and PDOS investigation illustrate
that the Ti 3d orbital of TiO2 dominates the valence band,
while the 2p orbital of oxygen is dominated by the conduction band.
Similarly, the In–S interaction dominates the conduction band
minima of AgInS2, while the Ag–S interaction determines
the valence band maxima. Hence, on solar light illumination on the
composite structure, the electrons migrate from the 4d orbital of
Ag and 3p orbitals of sulfur toward the 5s orbital of In of AgInS2 and latter proceed to the 2p orbital of oxygen in titania.47,95

In accordance with the theoretical study, trapping experiments,
and the band gap values from UV-DRS, a likely photocatalytic and interfacial
electron-transfer mechanism for AgInS2–TiO2 heterojunction is illustrated in Figure 24. The conduction band (CB) and valence band
(VB) potentials of the heterostructure components (AgInS2 and TiO2) are vital to comprehend the migration of photoexcited
charge carriers above the nanocomposites. The relevant calculations
and the summarized explanation of the process are given in the Supporting Information.

Figure 24 Graphical illustration
of the photocatalytic mechanism for AgInS2–TiO2 (a) before and (b) after heterojunction
formation.

Therefore, by means of the calculated values, as
given in the Supporting Information, a
likely photocatalytic
mechanism is proposed below. The CB and VB edge values of AgInS2 and titania, prior and later the AgInS2–TiO2 heterojunction creation, are illustrated in Figure 24. Figure 24a displays the Fermi level positions of
AgInS2 and titania at 0.27 and −0.1 eV correspondingly.
The formation of the heterostructure results in the Fermi levels of
AgInS2 and titania to an extent at a uniform level (Figure 24b). Since the dopant
level of AgInS2 is extremely low, thus the band position
of AgInS2 is altered, and hence the Fermi level of AgInS2 reaches −0.1 eV.47 The
refreshed band edge locations for AgInS2 are found to be
at +0.825 and −0.625 eV, as both the VB and CB shift, as shown
in Figure 24b. Charged
excitons are produced on the surface of titania and AgInS2 on being irradiated with solar light. The holes on the VB of TiO2 and the holes on the VB of AgInS2 participate
in the reaction process individually,96 while the electrons from the CB of AgInS2 migrate to
the conduction band of titania. The electrons participate along with
the adsorbed O2 in the surface of the photocatalyst to
form anO2* (superoxide) radical. As observed in the result
of trapping experiments, the electrons, superoxide radicals, and the
holes played the role of predominant species. These radicals were
further engaged in photocatalytic reactions.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the current
study reported the fabrication of ternary
metal chalcogenide heterostructure nanocomposites of titania. The
composite material showcased a dramatic improvement in visible light
absorption. The increase in the dopant percent in the composite ensued
in the narrowing of the band gap. Furthermore, the shift in the peak
signals of XPS suggested an alteration in the chemical surroundings
of the heterostructure. Importantly, the degradation outcomes illustrated
the enhanced efficiency, and comparable results were observed in the
case of the light-induced hydrogen generation. The composite structures
displayed 300 times enhanced hydrogen production output when matched
with their bare sample materials. A log-5 microbial inactivation was
accomplished in 30 min of light irradiance. A possible interfacial electron transfer and the photocatalytic mechanism
are offered based on the computational analysis, species trapping
experiment, and also the band gap value estimation from the absorbance
plot. Therefore, the current investigation details the positive composite
preparation and highlights the multifunctional photocatalytic applications.

4 Materials and Method
4.1 Photocatalyst Preparation
Pristine
anatase titania was synthesized by the sol–gel method, using
titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) as the precursor. In this experiment,
20 mL of TTIP was suspended in 100 mL of isopropanol. Further on continuous
stirring, distilled water was added slowly to the solution of TTIP
in isopropanol. The volume of water and isopropanol was equal, and
the resultant sol was left for gel formation for 120 min at room temperature.
The white colloid gel that formed was allowed to dry for 12 h at 100
°C in an oven. The dried xerogel was ground and further calcined
using a muffle furnace at 500 °C, with a gradient rate of 600
°C per h for 2 h.

The one-pot solvothermal method was used
to prepare AgInS2–TiO2 heterostructure
composites. A certain quantity of AgNO3, In(NO3)3·xH2O, and thiourea
(1:1:2) was vigorously stirred in 30 mL of ethanolamine for 30 min.
The prepared TiO2 was added to the mixture and was sonicated
for the next half an hour. The above mixture was transferred into
a 50 mL steel Teflon-lined vessel and heated up to 180 °C for
12 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the resultant solid
product was washed with water and ethanol multiple times to remove
the residue. The washed powder was dried at 60 °C for 12 h and denoted as
AgInS2–TiO2, and it was used for further
characterization and applications. The parent sample, AgInS2, was synthesized using the same method without the addition of TiO2.47

4.2 Photocatalytic Activity
To evaluate
the photocatalytic efficiency of synthesized AgInS2–TiO2 samples, photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline (DC) under
solar light radiance by means of a photoreactor unit was done. In
this experiment, 0.10 g of the photocatalyst was added into 100 mL
of DC (10–5 M) solution (1 g/L) in water and was
stirred for 1 h in dark prior to irradiation to attain absorption–desorption
equilibrium. During the illumination period, aliquots were withdrawn
at an interval of 15 min. A UV–vis spectrophotometer was used
to measure the degradation profiles of the doxycycline with respect
to time of the sample aliquots. The reduction in the peak intensity
(357 nm) of doxycycline was analyzed. Similarly, the degradation profiles
of bare samples (TiO2 and AgInS2) were performed
for a comparative evaluation. To assess the recyclability of the samples,
the photocatalysts were subjected to centrifugation, washing, drying,
and these were reused after each experiment.

4.2.1 Species Trapping Experiment
Different
scavenger tests were performed to analyze the ROS (reactive oxygen
species) formed during the catalytic reaction in the mixture. Radical
scavengers like isopropanol (10 mM), AgNO3 (6 mM), benzoquinone
(6 mM), and triethanolamine (10 mM) were added into separate photocatalytic
systems to quench the formed hydroxyl radicals (OH–), electron, superoxide radicals (O2•), and holes, respectively. The concentration of catalysts was kept
as same as for degradation studies (0.08 g in 80 mL of aqueous DC).
These solutions were kept in dark condition for 60 min, and further,
they were allowed to expose to light irradiation for another 180 min.
Aliquots were taken at an interval of 15 min and tested for DC concentration
for the photocatalytic experiments as explained above.

4.3 Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation
The photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiments were performed
in a 300 mL annular glass batch reactor, which was concealed with
an aluminum foil (Figure 25).

Figure 25 Schematic diagram of the photocatalytic reactor.

A 125 W high-pressure mercury vapor lamp from Helios
Italquartz
was used as the light source. During the experiments, the temperature
of the reactor was maintained at 25 °C using a thermostatic bath
(Falc GTR 90). The reactants and gaseous nitrogen were fed into the
reactor through an inlet, and gaseous sample aliquots at different
times were taken through an outlet.

In a typical H2 experiment, a fixed amount of the photocatalytic
material and CH3OH solution was added into 300 mL of aqueous
solution, and the subsequent solution was fed into the reactor under
magnetic stirring. To prevent the unwanted reactions of dissolved
oxygen with photogenerated electrons, the solution was flushed with
nitrogen gas for 30 min before the photocatalytic runs. Furthermore,
nitrogen was continuously fed to the reactor with a flow rate (QN2) of 0.3 L/min throughout the experiments.

The pH of the solution was observed with an Orion 420Ap pH-meter
(Thermo) during the experiments. The collected liquid aliquots at
different time intervals were quickly filtered using regenerated cellulose
filters (pore diameter 0.20 μm, Scharlau), and the pH was measured
using the filtrate.

The Tedlar gas sampling bags were used to
collect the gaseous samples
recovered from the outlet, and then the hydrogen concentration is
evaluated. A gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) equipped with an HP–PLOT
Molesieve 5A column (Agilent) and a TCD detector with argon as the
carrier gas were used to measure the concentration of hydrogen in
the samples.

The radiation that emerged from the reactor was
evaluated on the
exterior walls of the reactor with radiometers in the wavelength ranges
from 315 to 400 and to 400 to 1100 nm during the experiments. 1 M
sodium nitrite solution was introduced inside the cooling jacket for
maintaining 25 °C temperature during the experiment and to cut-off
UVA radiation emitted from the lamp (⌊ < 400 nm) for a fixed
reaction time of 60 min in all of the same experiments.

4.4 Photocatalytic Antimicrobial Activity
Bacterial disinfection efficiency of AgInS2–TiO2 composites was calculated with Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) strains and compared the activity with the parent samples TiO2 and AgInS2. A fixed concentration of 1 g/L of
the catalyst in bacterial suspensions (strain in 0.9% NaCl solution)
was taken in a cylindrical glass and placed inside a photochamber
under visible light irradiation for 3 h. The concentration of bacterial
colonies in the buffer solution was maintained as 104 CFU/mL
(colony forming units/mL) for all experiments. Aliquots of 1 mL of
the cell suspension were taken at fixed time intervals of 15 min.
To attain a countable CFU, aliquots were diluted in PBS (phosphate-buffered
saline) solution (pH 7), and then 0.1 mL of aliquots was spread onto
an agar plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The viable cells
were counted and recorded as CFU/mL. Control experiments were performed
with the bare bacterial solution, and all samples were also examined
under dark environments. All analyses were conducted in triplicate.
Log reduction and N/N0% vs time plot were utilized to calculate
the antimicrobial efficiency.
