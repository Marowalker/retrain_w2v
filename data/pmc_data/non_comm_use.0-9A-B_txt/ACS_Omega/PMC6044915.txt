Five enantiomeric
pairs of palladium complexes of 1,2,4-triazole-derived
chiral N-heterocyclic carbene ligands were investigated to probe the
influence of chirality on the compound’s anticancer activity.
Although no chirality-related influence was observed for any of the
enantiomeric pair, strong anticancer activity was seen for a particular
pair, (1S,2S,5R)-1c and (1R,2R,5S)-1c, which was significantly more active
than the benchmark drug cisplatin for human breast cancer cells, MCF-7
(ca. 24–27-fold), and human cervical cancer cells, HeLa (ca.
three- to fourfold). Broadening its scope of application, (1R,2R,5S)-1c also exhibited antiproliferative activity against lung cancer (A549),
skin cancer (B16F10), and multidrug-resistant mammary tumor (EMT6/AR1)
cell lines. Interestingly, (1R,2R,5S)-1c displayed 8- and 16-fold stronger
antiproliferative activity toward B16F10 and MCF-7 relative to their
respective noncancerous counterparts, L929 (fibroblast skin cells)
and MCF10A (epithelial breast cells), thereby upholding the potential
of these complexes for further development as anticancer agents. (1R,2R,5S)-1c inhibited tumor-cell proliferation by blocking the cells at the
G2 phase. (1R,2R,5S)-1c caused DNA damage in MCF-7 cells, leading to mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species production and subsequently cell death. We
also present evidence indicating that (1R,2R,5S)-1c induced p53-dependent
programmed cell death in MCF-7 cells.

Introduction
Cancer still remains
a formidable threat to human society accounting
for maximum number of deaths annually worldwide.1 Of the several strategies at disposal for battling the
disease, organic2−4 and inorganic compounds5−7 having high anticancer
activity play pivotal role in chemotherapy, which may be administered
before or after surgery depending upon the line of the treatment.8−11 A variety of such anticancer drugs of organic genre,8,12−14 namely, taxol, podophyllotoxin, camptothecin, and
so forth, and of inorganic genre,15,16 such as cis-diamineplatinum(II)dichloride (cisplatin), carboplatin,
and oxaliplatin, are thus being routinely prescribed as a part of
cancer treatment. However, between these two genres of anticancer
drugs, the organic ones are significantly more potent than their inorganic
counterparts. For example, the half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) range observed for taxol (2.5–4.1 nM)17 is substantially lower than that of the cisplatin
(13–36 μM)18 for various cancer
cell lines like MCF-7, HeLa, HT-29, and A549 under in vitro conditions.

This interesting observation triggered us to undertake the design
and development of transition-metal complexes displaying high anticancer
activities at par with the organic genre anticancer drugs. In this
regard, while looking into the viability of palladium as a substitute
for platinum for designing metal-based anticancer drugs, we have earlier
reported a palladium N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex, showing
ca. 2–20 times higher activity than the cisplatin under in
vitro conditions.19 Moving forward, we
aim at further increasing the potency of this palladium complex by
lowering its IC50 value by suitable structural modifications.
In this context, a recent report of a ruthenium(II)-based anticancer
drug, exhibiting a 35-fold increase in potency owing to enhanced solubility
arising from a change in counteranion15,20,21 led us to seek similar increase in potency of our
palladium complex by enhancing its solubility through incorporation
of polar anionic substituents.

It is worth noting that our earlier
reported palladium N-heterocyclic
carbene complex arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase triggering
apoptotic cell death19 and thereby indicated
a pathway bearing resemblance to that of cisplatin’s, for which
the metal center too binds to the nuclear DNA, stopping transcription.16 Hence, given the fact that DNA is chiral by
itself as well as expecting our palladium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes
to operate by a pathway similar to that of cisplatin’s, we
chose to probe the influence of chirality by deciding to study the
anticancer properties of the enantiomeric pairs of these palladium
N-heterocyclic carbene complexes.

Here in this article, we report
a comprehensive anticancer study
of five enantiomeric pairs of palladium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes,
(1S,2S,5R)-(1–3)b and (1R,2R,5S)-(1–3)b, (1S,2S,5R)-(1c, 3c) and (1R,2R,5S)-(1c, 3c), looking into the influence of chirality on their
respective anticancer activities (Figure 1). All of the complexes displayed moderate
to strong anticancer activity; however, no effect of chirality on
the anticancer activity of the compounds was observed. The complex
(1R,2R,5S)-1c was found to be the most active and showed potent antiproliferative
activity against various cancer cell lines. It was found to be much
more potent than the highly successful anticancer drug, cisplatin.
Further, (1R,2R,5S)-1c showed differential antiproliferative activity
toward cancer cells and their noncancerous counterparts. (1R,2R,5S)-1c treatment induced DNA damage, inhibited cell-cycle progression at
G2 phase, and induced p53-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
The results suggested that complex (1R,2R,5S)-1c has a strong anticancer potential.

Results and Discussion
Five enantiomeric pairs of the palladium N-heterocyclic carbene
complexes, centered on a chiral menthyl moiety, were constructed by
a sequence of reactions starting from the enantiomers of 1-menthyl-1,2,4-triazoles,
(1S,2S,5R)-A22 and (1R,2R,5S)-A, based on our earlier
reported protocol for the (1S,2S,5R)-1b22 and (1S,2S,5R)-3b22 complexes. The direct
alkylation reaction with alkyl bromides yielded the respective 1,2,4-triazolium
bromide salts (1S,2S,5R)-(1–3)a and (1R,2R,5S)-(1–3)a (Scheme 1). The reaction of (1S,2S,5R)-(1–3)a and (1R,2R,5S)-(1–3)a with
PdBr2 produced the bromide derivatives (1S,2S,5R)-(1–3)b and (1R,2R,5S)-(1–3)b in 71–94% yields in their enantiopure
forms and were easily characterized from their equal and opposite
optical rotation values. The incorporation of the polar CF3CO2 moiety was achieved by simple salt metathesis reaction
of two of the bromide derivatives, (1S,2S,5R)-(1b, 3b) and (1R,2R,5S)-(1b, 3b), with Ag(CO2CF3), giving
the corresponding trifluoroacetate-derived enantiomeric pairs, (1S,2S,5R)-(1c, 3c) and (1R,2R,5S)-(1c, 3c), in 57–66% yields.

Complexes of Palladium
The molecular structures of all of the five enantiomeric
pairs
of the palladium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes, including the two,
(1S,2S,5R)-1b and (1S,2S,5R)-3b, reported earlier22 have
been determined by X-ray crystallography, which provided further insights
into the absolute configurations of the stereocenters in these complexes
(Figures 2, 3, S1–S6, and Table S1). As expected, a square planar geometry was observed for all of
the complexes with the two N-heterocyclic carbene ligands being bound
to the metal center in a trans fashion, and the anionic bromide and
the CF3CO2 ligands occupied the remaining two
trans sites. The Pd–Ccarbene distance
of ca. 2.008(6)−2.049(11) Å observed in the
bromo derivatives, (1S,2S,5R)-2b and (1R,2R,5S)-(1–3)b, compare
well with the range of 1.999(10)−2.022(11) Å
observed in two of earlier reported bromide enantiomers, (1S,2S,5R)-1b and (1S,2S,5R)-3b,22 and also with that
of 2.020(8)−2.047(11) Å of the trifluoroacetate
derivatives (1S,2S,5R)-(1c, 3c) and (1R,2R,5S)-(1c, 3c).

All of the enantiomeric pairs, (1S,2S,5R)-(1–3)b and (1R,2R,5S)-(1–3)b, (1S,2S,5R)-(1c, 3c) and (1R,2R,5S)-(1c, 3c), when evaluated against
MCF-7, human breast cancer cells, in culture using sulforhodamine
B (SRB) assay, showed moderate to excellent activities displaying
IC50 values as low as 550 ± 20 nM (Figure 4 and Table
S2). Of these, the enantiomeric pair (1S,2S,5R)-1c and (1R,2R,5S)-1c was the
most active, exhibiting extremely low IC50 values of 700
± 5 and 550 ± 20 nM, respectively, in case of MCF-7 cells,
which are significantly lower than those reported for other related
palladium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes, namely, trans-[1-benzyl-3-t-butylimidazol-2-ylidene]2PdCl2 (IC50 value: 1 ± 3 μM),19 {[1-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-3-(N-tert-butyl-ethan-2-amine)imidazol-2-ylidene]Pd(allyl)}Cl
(IC50 value: 6.47 ± 0.07 μM),23 and the benchmark drug cisplatin (IC50 value:
15 ± 2 μM),19 for the same cancer
cell line. Also notable is the fact that the extremely low IC50 values of the enantiomeric pair (1S,2S,5R)-1c and (1R,2R,5S)-1c are ca.
27-fold lower than the benchmark drug cisplatin (IC50 value:
14.9 ± 0.4 μM) in MCF-7 cells (Figures 5a, S90, and Table S3). This observation further supports
our approach of making potent anticancer compounds by increasing its
solubility, which has been achieved in the enantiomeric pair (1S,2S,5R)-1c and (1R,2R,5S)-1c by the incorporation of two polar CF3CO2 moieties.

representation of the comparison of the anticancer activity of (1R,2R,5S)-1c against cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and B16F10, and their respective
noncancerous counterparts, MCF10A and L929.

Although all of the complexes displayed anticancer activity
against
MCF-7 cells, no influence was observed of chirality. Both the enantiomers
of all of the five pairs of the enantiomeric palladium complexes exhibited
near-equal activities (Figure 4 and Table S2, entries 1–5). The lack of the influence of chirality on the anticancer activity
may be due to the larger dimensions of the chiral major (ca. 22 Å)
and minor (ca. 12 Å) grooves of DNA24 with respect to the chiral menthyl moieties having cross-sectional
diameter of ca. 8 Å in the enantiomeric pairs of the palladium
N-heterocyclic carbene complexes. The other possibility for the lack
of the influence of chirality may also be due to a different species
interacting with the DNA strands other than the chiral palladium N-heterocyclic
carbene complexes in its original forms.

The most potent enantiomeric
pair, (1S,2S,5R)-1c and (1R,2R,5S)-1c, when studied
on another cancer cell line, namely, the human cervical cancer cells
(HeLa), exhibited IC50 values of 2.6 ± 1.6 and 2.3
± 1 μM, respectively, which were ca. three- to fourfold
more active than that observed for cisplatin (IC50 value:
8.5 ± 0.7 μM) for the same cancer cell line (Figures 5a, S91, and Table S3). Furthermore, a closer
look at the IC50 values of all of the palladium N-heterocyclic
carbene complexes across the aforementioned two cancer cell lines
(Tables S2 and S3) reveals the (1R,2R,5S)-1c complex to be the most potent one, for which the anticancer activity
study was further extended to other cancerous cell lines. In this
context, (1R,2R,5S)-1c exhibited IC50 values of 5.7 ±
1.6 and 1.3 ± 0.4 μM for human lung cancer (A549) and mouse
skin cancer (B16F10) cell lines, respectively (Figures 6, S92, S93, and Table S4).
Furthermore, (1R,2R,5S)-1c complex could also inhibit the proliferation of
multidrug-resistant EMT6/AR1 cells with an IC50 value of
4.8 ± 0.3 μM, thereby extending the broad scope of acceptability
of this (1R,2R,5S)-1c complex against various cancer cell lines (Figures 6, S93, and Table S4).

Figure 6 Graphical representation
of the anticancer activity of the most
potent Pd–NHC complex (1R,2R,5S)-1c against various cancer cell
lines, namely, MCF-7, HeLa, B16F10, A549, and EMT6/AR1.

Finally, the selectivity of the (1R,2R,5S)-1c complex
was tested with respect
to the nontumor cell lines, L929 (mouse fibroblast skin cells) and
MCF10A (human epithelial breast cells), and their respective cancerous
cells, B16F10 (mouse skin cancer cells) and MCF-7. (1R,2R,5S)-1c showed
ca. 8-fold more potency toward B16F10 (IC50 value: 1.3
± 0.4 μM) relative to L929 (IC50 value: 10.5
± 0.2 μM) and ca. 16-fold more potency toward MCF-7 (IC50 value: 0.55 ± 0.02 μM) relative to MCF10A (IC50 value: 8.6 ± 0.9 μM) (Figures 5b, S90, S92, and Table S5). These findings thus highlight the potential of this class
of palladium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes for further development
as anticancer agents.

The mechanism of cytotoxicity of the most
potent enantiomeric pair
(1R,2R,5S)-1c was investigated through a series of experiments. To examine
whether (1R,2R,5S)-1c induces cell death, MCF-7 cells were treated without
or with 4 and 8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c. The percentage of dead cells was determined
by flow cytometry after propidium iodide (PI) staining (Figure 7a). Proportions of 41 and 90%
of the total cells were found to be dead when treated with 4 and 8
μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 48 h, respectively, whereas only 2% of the
total population were dead in control (untreated) cells. On the other
hand, 4 μM cisplatin treatment could kill only 8% of the total
cells, which was significantly less compared to 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c (Figure 7a and Table 1). (1R,2R,5S)-1c-treated
cells could undergo either apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Further,
the effect of (1R,2R,5S)-1c on poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate-ribose)
(poly(ADP-ribose)) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage in cells was elucidated
by western blot analysis using anti-PARP antibody. Under cellular
stress, PARP-1 aids in DNA repair by adding poly(ADP-ribose) polymers.25 During apoptosis, PARP-1 (125 kDa) is cleaved
into 85 kDa fragment by caspases, thus inactivating the protein. Cleaved
PARP-1 is thus considered a typical indicator of apoptosis in cells.26 PARP cleavage was observed in MCF-7 cells after
48 h incubation with 4 and 8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c, indicating apoptosis
in cells (Figure 7b).
However, 4 μM cisplatin did not cleave PARP in cells. Cell-death
analysis by PI staining and determination of PARP cleavage by western
blot showed that (1R,2R,5S)-1c caused apoptosis in cells in a concentration-dependent
manner. More interestingly, the effect of (1R,2R,5S)-1c was more pronounced
than cisplatin and much lower concentration of (1R,2R,5S)-1c was required
to kill cells as compared to cisplatin. Clearly, the complex (1R,2R,5S)-1c is more potent than cisplatin.

in MCF-7 cells. (a) (1R,2R,5S)-1c treatment leads to cell death in MCF-7

cytometry. Representative images from three independent sets of experiments
are shown. (b) (1R,2R,5S)-1c cleaves PARP in MCF-7 cells, indicating apoptosis.
MCF-7 cells were treated without and with 4 and 8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 48 h. PARP cleavage was determined by western blot using anti-PARP
immunoglobulin G (IgG). Actin was used as a loading control. The experiment
was performed three times. Representative blot is shown.

set of experiments, and ± indicates standard deviation (SD).

To elucidate the mechanism
of cell death, several experiments were
performed. Compounds like cisplatin27 induce
DNA damage and are known to block cells at the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle. As expected, (1R,2R,5S)-1c also showed strong DNA-damaging effects
on MCF-7 cells. Exposure of cells to DNA-damaging stress like ionizing
radiation or other DNA-damaging agents leads to the generation of
double-stranded breaks (DSBs), resulting in the phosphorylation of
histone H2A variant H2AX at Ser 139, producing γ-H2AX.28 Phosphorylation of H2AX (γ-H2AX) due to
DNA damage is abundant, fast, and can be correlated with each DSB.28 Thus, it is a highly sensitive marker that can
be used to determine DNA damage in cells. We determined the DNA-damaging
effects of (1R,2R,5S)-1c by assessing the phosphorylation of histone-2AX
(γ-H2AX) using immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells treated
without and with 4 and 8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c and 4 μM cisplatin were
stained with γ-H2AX antibody, and DNA was stained with Hoechst.
Tremendous increase in the phosphorylation of H2AX (γ-H2AX intensity)
was observed in (1R,2R,5S)-1c-treated cells as compared to control
cells. However, 4 μM cisplatin-treated cells showed much reduced
γ-H2AX intensity compared to 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c-treated
cells (Figure 8a,b).
The results suggested that (1R,2R,5S)-1c had a stronger DNA-damaging
effect on MCF-7 cells than cisplatin.

Figure 8 (1R,2R,5S)-1c causes DNA damage in MCF-7
cells. (a) MCF-7 cells were
treated without and with 4 and 8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 36 h and immunostaining

intensity was calculated using ImageJ software. The experiment was
performed three times, and in each case, 500 cells were scored. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 show statistical
significance of the data.

DNA damage correlates with the induction of reactive oxygen
species
(ROS) in cells.29 Interplay between DNA
damage response cascade and ROS signaling in cells is responsible
for inducing apoptosis following DNA damage.29 DNA damage induced by (1R,2R,5S)-1c led to a dramatic increase in ROS levels
in MCF-7 cells. The generation of intracellular ROS was evaluated
by ROS assay using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA).30 H2DCFDA is a cell-permeable
molecule. Inside the cells, ROS can oxidize H2DCFDA to fluorescent
2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein,30 which can be detected by flow cytometry. Figure 9a,b shows the percentage of (1R,2R,5S)-1c-treated
cells with intracellular ROS generation (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA)-positive cells) using flow cytometry. Majority of the total cells (72%)
were DCFH-DA positive when treated with 30 μM hydrogen peroxide,
which was used as a positive control. In cells incubated with 4 and
8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 24 h, 49 and 74% of the total cells were DCFH-DA
positive, respectively (Figure 9b and Table 2). It is well known that dissipation of mitochondrial potential is
associated with the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS).31,32 The data suggested that DNA damage induced
by (1R,2R,5S)-1c leads to ROS production in cells, causing apoptosis following
mitochondrial pathway.

Nuclear DNA damage can cause cell-growth arrest, subsequently
leading
to apoptosis in cells. To determine the effect of (1R,2R,5S)-1c on the
progression of the cell cycle, MCF-7 cells were incubated without
or with 2 and 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 36 h. Treated cells were incubated
with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. The DNA distribution profiles
of different phases of cell cycle showed that (1R,2R,5S)-1c blocks
MCF-7 cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Figure 10a). Proportions of 35 and
50% of the total cells were blocked at G2/M when treated with 2 and
4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 36 h, respectively, whereas in control cells
only 10% of the cells were in the G2/M phase (Figure 10a and Table 3). However, it was not clear from the data whether
the cells got arrested in the G2 or M phase of the cell cycle. Further,
mitotic cells were visualized under the microscope after staining
with Hoechst 33258. MCF-7 cells were incubated without or with 2 and
4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 36 h, and the number of cells in mitosis were
counted on the basis of DNA morphology. The mitotic index (percentage
of cells in mitosis) of MCF-7 cells treated with 2 and 4 μM
(1R,2R,5S)-1c was found to be similar to that of the control cells. This
implies that the cells were arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle
and not mitosis (Figure 10b,c and Table 3). The results indicated that (1R,2R,5S)-1c arrested cells at the G2 phase
and prevented the cells from entering mitosis, which subsequently
induced apoptosis in these cells.

Figure 10 (1R,2R,5S)-1c arrested MCF-7 cells at the

(a) (1R,2R,5S)-1c blocked cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. DNA
distribution profiles in different phases of the cell cycle after
36 h treatment with media alone (control) or 2 and 4 μM of (1R,2R,5S)-1c were determined by flow cytometry. Data analysis was done using
FlowJo software. (b) (1R,2R,5S)-1c did not arrest cells at mitosis. MCF-7
cells were incubated without and with 2 and 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 36
h. Mitotic cells were visualized on the basis of DNA morphology after
staining the cells with Hoechst 33258. The scale bar is 20 μm.
(c) Mitotic index was calculated from the microscopy data and plotted.
The experiment was performed three times, and 1000 cells were scored
in each case. *p < 0.05 shows statistical significance

a Cell-cycle analysis

indices of MCF-7 cells without and with 2 and 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c. Cell-cycle analysis was done using flow cytometry. Data were analyzed
using FlowJo software. Mitotic index was calculated on the basis of
DNA morphology of cells. Data were average of three independent sets
of experiments with SD (±), and 1000 cells were scored in each
set.

G2 arrest triggers
p53 and various other signaling pathways to
ensure that apoptosis follows the G2 block in cells.33 Different stress signals, including DNA damage, stabilize
cytoplasmic p53 protein and lead to its translocation and accumulation
in the nucleus. This leads to transcription activation of p53-dependent
genes, such as Bax, p21, and so forth.34 The G2 arrest in MCF-7 cells after (1R,2R,5S)-1c treatment was further
confirmed by p53 and p21 staining. MCF-7 cells treated without and
with 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c were processed for immunofluorescence
using anti-p53 antibody. In the presence of 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c, 78% of
the cells showed nuclear accumulation of p53, whereas in control cells,
it was only 23% (Figure 11a). Nuclear accumulation of p21, the downstream target gene
of p53, was also determined by microscopic analysis of (1R,2R,5S)-1c-treated
cells using p21 antibody. Increased (73%) nuclear accumulation of
p21 was observed in 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c-treated cells compared to untreated
(control) cells (18%) (Figure 11b). The data suggested that nuclear accumulation of
p53 led to the activation of p53-responsive genes and subsequent apoptosis
in cells. The results indicated that DNA damage induced by (1R,2R,5S)-1c arrested cells at the G2 phase of the cell cycle and followed p53-dependent
pathway for cell death.

(1R,2R,5S)-1c treatment leads to nuclear accumulation of p53. MCF-7 cells

Conclusions
Five enantiomeric pairs of 1,2,4-triazole-based
palladium complexes
(1S,2S,5R)-(1–3)b and (1R,2R,5S)-(1–3)b, (1S,2S,5R)-(1c, 3c) and (1R,2R,5S)-(1c, 3c) of chiral N-heterocyclic carbene ligands were
synthesized and investigated for their anticancer properties. All
of the complexes displayed antiproliferative properties against MCF-7
cells in culture. However, the enantiomers of all of the complexes
exhibited nearly equal activity, suggesting no influence of chirality
on their antiproliferative activity. Furthermore, a particular enantiomeric
pair (1S,2S,5R)-1c and (1R,2R,5S)-1c bearing CF3CO2 moieties displayed
significantly higher anticancer activity than cisplatin against human
breast and cervical cancer cells. It is important to underline that
(1R,2R,5S)-1c exhibited very low toxicity toward noncancerous cell lines
compared to their cancerous counterpart. The detailed mechanistic
study suggests that the (1R,2R,5S)-1c is a highly effective DNA-damaging anticancer
agent. (1R,2R,5S)-1c induced the production of intracellular ROS, stalled
cells at the G2 phase, and led to p53-dependent programmed cell death
(apoptosis). In summary, the biological characterization of the compound
(1R,2R,5S)-1c provides compelling evidence to suggest that (1R,2R,5S)-1c is more potent than cisplatin and pointed toward the potential of
this type of palladium-based N-heterocyclic carbene complexes for
further development as anticancer agents.

Procedures
The standard Schlenk techniques
were employed for all manipulations. Palladium bromide, (1R)-(−)-menthol, (1S)-(+)-menthol,
and silver trifluoroacetate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. (1R,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl p-toluenesulfonate22 and (1S,2R,5S)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl p-toluenesulfonate were synthesized by following modified
literature procedures.22 The ligand precursors
(1S,2S,5R)-1a and (1S,2S,5R)-3a and the palladium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes
(1S,2S,5R)-1b and (1S,2S,5R)-3b were prepared according to a literature procedure
reported by us.22 Bruker 400 and 500 MHz
NMR spectrometers were used for recording the 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, and 19F{1H} NMR
spectra. 1H NMR signals are labeled as singlet (s), doublet
(d), triplet (t), broad (br), triplet of triplet (tt), doublet of
doublet (dd), doublet of quartets (dq), multiplet (m), and septet
(sept). PerkinElmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer was used to record
the infrared spectra. Micromass quad time-of-flight spectrometer and
Bruker maxis impact spectrometers were used for the mass spectrometry
analysis. Thermo Finnigan FlashEA 1112 series elemental analyzer was
used for the analysis of CHNS. Single-crystal X-ray data for compounds
(1–3)b, 1c, and 3c were collected on Oxford Diffraction XCALIBUR-S diffractometer
and Rigaku Hg 724+ diffractometer, solved using direct method and
standard difference map techniques, and refined by full-matrix least-squares
procedures on F2. X-ray metrical data

Methods
Cell Culture
EMT6/AR1 cells were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) and were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 1 mg/mL doxorubicin.
MCF-7, MCF10A, HeLa, A549, B16F10, and L929 were purchased from National
Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India. mtrDNA sequence analysis
was done by NCCS to confirm the species, and cells were tested free
from mycoplasma. MCF-7, HeLa, B16F10, and L929 cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (HiMedia,
India). A549 cells were cultured in F-12k medium (Kaighn’s
Modification of Ham’s F-12 Medium) (HiMedia, India). MCF10A
cells were cultured in 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F-12 medium (HiMedia) supplemented
with 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone,
and 10 μg/mL insulin. The media were supplemented with 10% (v/v)
FBS, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic
solution, as described earlier.35 Cells
were grown in a 37 °C incubator in a humidified chamber (Sanyo,
Tokyo, Japan) of 5% CO2.

Cell-Proliferation Assay
The palladium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes, (1S,2S,5R)-(1–3)b and (1R,2R,5S)-(1–3)b, (1S,2S,5R)-(1, 3)c and (1R,2R,5S)-(1, 3)c, were dissolved in 100% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated
for their antiproliferative property in culture. Cells were seeded
in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well.
After the cells were attached, they were incubated without or with
different concentrations of the complexes at 37 °C for one cell
cycle (48 h). The effect of the compounds on the proliferation of
the cells was determined using sulforhodamine B assay36,37 by measuring the absorbance at 520 nm using a SpectraMax M2e Microplate reader, as described earlier. IC50 was
calculated as the concentration of the complex that inhibited the
proliferation of cells by 50% relative to the untreated cells. The
inhibitory effect of the most potent complex (1R,2R,5S)-1c on HeLa, A549, B16F10,
EMT6/AR1, L929, and MCF10A cells after 24, 22, 20, 15, 14, and 16
h, respectively, was determined by sulforhodamine B assay as described
above.

Western Blot Analysis
MCF-7 cells (5 mL) were seeded
at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/mL in 60 mm cell-culture
dishes. After cell attachment, they were incubated with 4 and 8 μM
(1R,2R,5S)-1c and 4 μM cisplatin for 48 h. The cells were then
processed, and the whole cell lysate was isolated as described earlier.38 An equal amount of total protein was resolved
on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted
onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore). Immunoblotting
was performed using specific antibodies against PARP-1 and β-actin.
The blots were developed by chemiluminescence using HRP-conjugated
secondary IgG.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy
MCF-7
(5 × 104 cells/well) cells were seeded on glass cover
slip in a 24-well
cell-culture plate. After the cells were attached, they were incubated
with 4 and 8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c and 4 μM cisplatin for 36 h and
immunostaining was performed using specific antibodies as described
earlier.38,39 Cells were stained with anti-p53 IgG (1:300)
and anti-p21 IgG (1:300) for 2 h at 37 °C. All of the antibody
dilutions were made in 2% BSA and added after blocking cells with
2% BSA. Primary antibody incubation was followed by Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated
sheep anti-mouse secondary IgG (1:400) incubation for 1 h at 37 °C.
Hoechst 33258 was used to stain the DNA. To determine DNA damage,
cells were immunostained using anti-γ-H2AX IgG (1:200), followed
by Alexa Flour 555 goat anti-rabbit secondary IgG (1:400). ImageJ
software was used to calculate the fluorescence intensity. A total
of 500 cells were scored in each case. For mitotic index (percentage
of cells in mitosis) calculation, the cells were scored on the basis
of DNA morphology and plotted using graph pad, and 1000 cells were
scored in each case.

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Assay
Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production in cells when treated with (1R,2R,5S)-1c was estimated
by ROS assay using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA).40 MCF-7 cells (5 mL)
were seeded in 60 mm cell-culture dishes at a density of 1.5 ×
105 cells/mL. After cell attachment, they were incubated
with 4 and 8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 24 h. Cells treated with 30 μM
hydrogen peroxide were used as a positive control. Following 24 h
of incubation, the cells were processed and analyzed using flow cytometry.40

Live–Dead Assay and Cell-Cycle Analysis
by Flow Cytometry
MCF-7 cells (5 mL) were seeded in 60 mm
cell-culture dishes at
a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/mL. Cells were incubated
with 4 and 8 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 48 h for live–dead assay.
The cells were incubated with 2 and 4 μM (1R,2R,5S)-1c for 36
h for cell-cycle analysis. After the required incubation, cells were
processed and analyzed by flow cytometry, as described earlier.41 Cell-cycle data were analyzed using FlowJo software.

Statistical Analysis
Significance test analysis was
done using the Student t-test.
