Cellulose-based materials
are very attractive for emerging bioeconomy
as they are renewable, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly.
Cellulose beads are spherical and porous and can be highly engineered
to be used as catalyst support material. This type of inorganic catalysts
is cost-effective and suitable for multiple re-usage and has been
rarely explored in cellulose reaction research. In this work, NiFe-layered
double hydroxide (LDH) was tailor-made in situ on anionic cellulose
beads to form a hybrid, supported photocatalyst for the first time.
The hybrid beads were prepared in a size larger than the pulp fibers
in order to make the catalysis reaction heterogeneous in nature. Hydrophilic
pulp fibers were converted into hydrophobic pulp by photocatalytic
topochemical grafting of ethyl acrylate using the LDH-cellulose bead
catalyst. The approach identified for the modification of the pulp
fibers is the “hydrogen abstraction–UV photografting”
because the low-energy, UV radiation-induced grafting offers advantages,
such as a reduced degradation of the backbone polymer and a control
over the grafting reaction. After grafting, the pulp fibers showed
increased water repellency and unaltered thermal stability, indicating
the hydrophobic, plasticizing nature of the pulp, which in turn accounts
for its thermoformable behavior. These acrylated pulp fibers can be
further designed/customized for waterproof or oil absorption applications.

Introduction
Because of rising environment
concerns and society demands, bio-based
materials are of great interest to the scientists and industries.
Especially cellulose fiber-based products are much attractive owing
to their properties and abundance in nature. Many industries convert
cellulose into value-added consumer products such as absorbents, paper,
textiles, and fillers for pharmaceutical tablets. Nevertheless, all
these employ cellulose in its natural hydrophilic form. However, when
cellulose is made hydrophobic by chemical treatments, its range of
applicability widens. This brings more opportunity in research and
development, production followed by consumer supply. Hydrophobic cellulose
has very big potential in the food packaging industry in the near
future and it could replace “fossil-derived chemicals”-based
packaging polymers.1−3 Pulp fibers (PFs) in the form of translucent see-through
thin films for covering and wrapping of food products is one of the
desired target applications. Also, this type of bioplastic material
can be extruded and molded into container bottles or vessels to store
liquids, food, water-resistant building insulation material, stationary
phase in column or thin layer chromatography employing nonaqueous
(organic) solvents, oil-absorbent sponges, water-repellent papers,
and nonwoven fabrics.

There are literature reports where hydrophobic
cellulose composites
are derived from physical grafting/mixture interactions on cellulose
by water-repelling organic moieties.4−6 However, these composites
are made by using either expensive, time-consuming synthetic routes,
or environment polluting stoichiometric reagents. In addition, their
technical specifications require further improvement in order to compete
with other nonrenewable materials used for the same applications.
Hence, there is a need to produce these functional materials by simple,
inexpensive, eco-friendly chemical routes with high turnover and target
specifications. Our research meets this need as our protocol utilizes
(i) water as solvent medium, (ii) kraft PFs without any treatment,
(iii) abundantly available bio–geo mineral-based catalyst,
to yield target hydrophobicity and thermal stability specification
values. Further, our novel catalyst system was heterogenized in order
to separate the catalyst particles from the reaction mixture after
grafting. This means that the physical size/shape of the catalyst
particles was considerably larger for easy filtration from the solvent
medium. Hence, our catalyst material can be regenerated and recycled
and our synthesis and the final product exhibits promising qualities
that might fulfill the needs of industry.

In the present study,
ethyl acrylate (EA) was coupled with PFs
via dissociative esterification to add value to cellulose/pulp in
terms of its induced hydrophobic properties. EA or acrylic acid ethyl
ester was technically used as a precursor in many polymers, textiles,
nonwoven fabric and as additives in paints. EA is a clear, colorless
liquid with relatively low vapor pressure, readily miscible with most
of the organic solvents and sparingly soluble in water. Structure-wise,
EA has a five carbon chain with an olefinic π bond in one end
and two paraffinic carbons at the other end with a connecting functional
group, −COO– (ester).7 This
makes its hydrogen bond acceptor count 2 and topological polar surface
area (PSA) of 23 Å2. The hydrogen bond acceptor count
indicates the number of electronegative centers with a lone pair of
electrons readily available to form bonding with the hydrogen of another
molecule. The surface area covering the polar atoms (O, N, S, etc.)
in the molecule gives the PSA in angstrom units. If a molecule possesses
more polarizable groups, then it would have more PSA. EA possess the
“O”-induced polar surface. These properties are thoroughly
exploited in topochemical modification of PFs to bring hydrophobicity
in fibers as against its intrinsic hydrophilic nature bestowed by
−OH groups. The topochemical modification of PFs was carried
out in both noncatalyzed and catalyzed routes under irradiated and
nonirradiated conditions.

The catalyst we aimed to design to
facilitate EA grafting on pulp
was an inorganic material, named layered double hydroxide (LDH). Naturally
occurring mineral hydrotalcite [Mg6Al2(OH)16]CO3·4H2O] is the best example
for a LDH compound. It forms by charge neutralizing the cationic hydroxide
layers by mobile anions in interlayer galleries. LDH belongs to the
family of lamellar ionic solids possessing superior properties like
crystallinity, tunable surface area–size–porosity, cation–anion
exchangeability, swelling, and memory effect. These properties make
LDH an interesting candidate for exploring in the area of catalysis,
photocatalysis, adsorbents, composites, and medicine. LDH is identified
for its efficient and selective heterogeneous/photocatalytic application
in chemical syntheses, decomposition of pollutants, and production
of energy.8−17 Sobhana and coworkers31 synthesized NiFe
LDH by the co-precipitation method and carried out decomposition of
orange II dye, a water pollutant, by using NiFe LDH as a photocatalyst.
Gong et al. employed Ni–Fe LDH nanoplates in electrocatalysis
to oxidize water, as oxygen evolution is an important side pathway
in water splitting and metal–air batteries.18 NiFe LDH composed with carbon nitride has been proven an
efficient photocatalyst for water oxidation and reduction reactions,19 whereas NiFe LDH fabricated with CdS liberated
hydrogen from aqueous methanol solution photocatalytically.20 Ni nanoparticles decorated NiFe LDH performed
as a bifunctional catalyst in oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxidation
reaction under electrochemical conditions.21

In the present work, LDH was chosen to be employed as a photocatalyst
for the following reasons: (i) semiconducting, (ii) ability to initiate
hydrogen abstraction for radical formation, and (iii) potential to
transfer photogenerated electrons to the reactant surface. Photocatalysis
can be done in either heterogeneous condition or homogenous environment.
In homogeneous phase reactions, separation of the catalyst (i.e.,
LDH) from the product is often impossible, whereas under heterogeneous
conditions, the solid catalyst particles can be separated by simple
filtration. Therefore, modification of the catalyst turned to be very
important and a challenging step as both the reactant (PFs) and catalyst
(LDH particles) existed in the solid phase. Heterogeneous catalysts
have advantages owing to their ease of separation, reusability, and
cost-effectiveness. In order to make these types of catalysts, catalytically
active nano-/microcomponent should be anchored/supported on an inert
bulk solid matrix. In the present case, the size difference between
the supported catalyst and the reactant PFs must be high, as both
are in the solid state.

Cellulose has gained increasing interest
in materials research
because of its ecological properties, such as its natural abundance,
biodegradability, and renewability. Cellulose dissolution and regeneration
into definite physical forms/shapes has been a focus in recent years.22,23 The bead form of cellulose is one of the physical forms, which could
show numerous applications such as stationary phase in chromatographic
column, pharmaceutical fillers, absorbent, structure-directing agent,
and so forth.24 We realized that the cellulose
bead (CB) could act as catalyst support or catalyst anchoring site
matrix so that the fine particles of LDH can be immobilized on it
and used in heterogeneous catalysis.

The most important feature
in our study is that cellulose in PFs
has been derivatized using an organic moiety (EA) through proper chemical
bonding as opposed with widely reported weak physical bonding/interaction
(van der Waals force). The chemistry between host cellulosic −OH
groups and guest organic moiety in functional composites is not well
understood and reported. Thus, our investigation paves way to address
the intricacies of bonding, need of having proper chemical composites,
and robust properties in material applications. Further, we have attempted
to plasticize/hydrophobize cellulose in its original form (PF in water
medium) instead of first derivatizing it into some other form, for
example, ether, before functionalizing with EA. There are many reports
in which acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, EA was grafted on cellulose
ethers. However, the bonding is not of chemical type and it is merely
a physical mixture of cellulose and the grafted molecule.25−27 We believe that super-hydrophobic cellulose acrylate derivative
material will be a potential renewable substitute for petroleum-based
nonrenewable poly (-olefin, ester) plastics.

Results and Discussion
Hybrid
Bead Catalysts
An eco-friendly solvent system
(alkali/urea aqueous solution) was used to dissolve microcrystalline
cellulose, and the dissolved cellulose was extruded through a needle
nozzle into a regenerative acid medium for coagulation shaping into
spherical beads (CB). Further, the beads were subjected to (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl
(TEMPO) oxidation.

Oxidation brings anionic charges on the beads
via the introduction of the −COOH group in place of −CH2OH in cellulose moiety. Oxidation of the beads anionic CB
(ACB) was confirmed with reference to the unoxidized CBs via Raman
spectroscopy. The oxidized CBs exhibit peaks at 1614 cm–1 corresponding to −COOH out of phase stretching frequency28,29 (Figure 1). These
ACB were used as support material to anchor catalytically active LDH
nanoparticles, which was prepared from mixed metal salt solution of
Ni/Fe ratio 3:1. Heterogenization of the LDH particle catalyst is
vital for better separation of catalyst particles from the PF solution
at the end of the reaction (Figure S1).
Hence, we chose large-sized CB material as a matrix to immobilize
the photoactive NiFe LDH platelets. This type of novel hybrid structures
was used as heterogeneous catalysts for the first time. Powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD), attenuated total reflectance (ATR)–Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR), NMR, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements proved the successful synthesis
and growth of LDH on ACB.

Figure 1 Raman spectra of CBs.

XRD measurements were studied to ensure the authenticity
of the
structure and purity of the synthesized materials. Figure 2 shows the powder XRD patterns
of the CBs obtained from regenerated cellulose (CB), ACBs, LDH–ACB
hybrid beads (HBs). The extruded beads (CB) and oxidized CBs (ACB)
showed three different peaks at 11.22°, 19.17°, and 20.24°,
which were indexed as the (101), (101̅), and (002) planes of
the cellulose II structure. This confirmed the crystallinity of the
bead-shaped regenerated and oxidized cellulose.30 The unsupported LDH material usually displays the reflections
at 11.9°, 24°, 33°, 38°, and 42° corresponding
to (003), (006), (012), (015), and (018) planes, respectively, which
suggested the formation of NiFe LDH.31 These
strong reflections arising from the layers of LDH demonstrated the
crystalline nature of LDH particles.

Figure 2 XRD of CBs. * Peaks from the copper sample
holder (to be ignored).

The PXRD of the HB material exhibited plane reflections attributable
to both ACB and LDH discussed above. The diffraction peak appeared
at 10.9° (003 planes) was the peaks overlap aroused from both
ACB and LDH. Thus, the original peak for cellulose at 11.22°
merged with the LDH diffraction peak (Figure 2), suggesting enhanced LDH coverage on CBs.
The other peaks from LDH showed a layered structure of rhombohedral
symmetry in agreement with the hydrotalcite-like structure reference,
JCPDS no. 40-0215. This indicated the co-existence of NiFe LDHs and
cellulose in the hybrid material. Between these two components, cellulose
was obtained commercially as microcrystalline cellulose, whereas NiFe
LDH was synthesized in situ (in ACB–water dispersion medium)
as well as an individual control sample. Therefore, the purity of
the synthesized LDH should be vindicated.

As elaborated in the
experimental part, LDH was synthesized from
its precursors, nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in the presence of Na2CO3, NaOH in ACB-dispersed water solution. There
is always a possibility of anion exchange in LDH intergalleries initiated
by foreign anionic species; in the present case, it is anionic cellulose.
The XRD data suggested that there was no such intercalation, as the
(003) reflection from HB did not shift to the lower angle side (Figure 2). Hence, anionic
cellulose was not dissolved in the metal salt medium and subsequently
not displaced the already existing anions (CO32–, NO3–) in nascent LDH. The reason could
be the steric hindrance between the brucite layers of LDH, which made
the bulgy cellulose polymer unable to penetrate inside and undergo
anion exchange. Thus, electrostatic/ionic type chemical bonding was
avoided between LDH and ACB. This implied only the formation of physical
bonding between LDH–ACB, facilitated by van der Waals forces.
These forces were the outcome of hydrogen bonding between the −OH
groups of LDH and −COOH groups of ACB. Another thing in regard
with purity is that, the co-precipitation reaction might also form
undesirable byproducts like Ni(OH)3, Fe(OH)2–3, Ni(CO3)3, Fe(CO3)3,
Ni2O3, FeO, and Fe2O3.
However, their characteristic diffraction peaks were not found in
XRD spectra. Hence, no other detectable impurity phases were evidenced
during the characterization of control LDH and HB materials.

The sharp narrow peaks/peak heights of 003 and 006 reflections
revealed the smaller crystallite size of LDH particles.32 The basal spacing value for NiFe LDH in HB was
calculated as 8.10 Å (Table S1), and
this value was in good agreement with the literature.31 This higher value is due to the perpendicular orientation
of the interlayer anion to the cationic lamellar sheets and their
weaker electrostatic interaction.33,34 The hybrid
formation from LDH and ACB was allowed under air atmosphere and therefore,
the majority of the anions occupying the interlayer will be carbonates
with the inclusion of some nitrate anions. The interference of nitrate
anions is inevitable from the precursor solution that contributes
to an increase in the basal spacing between the layers.31 The distance between the metals in the cationic
layer was calculated to be 3.02 Å using the formula “a = 2 × d(110)” (Table S1). The XRD reflections from HB were slightly
broader in comparison to the highly ordered structure of LDH that
we reported earlier.31 This is because
of the higher octahedral ionic radius of Ni2+ (0.72 Å)
and Fe3+ (0.69 Å) occupying the brucite-like sheets.
The peaks at 110 and 113 were merged into one peak, signifying the
arrangement of metal cations in the lamellar layers.34 The modification of the CBs with TEMPO oxidation has thus
apparently resulted in the hybrid formation between LDH and cellulose.

The ATR–FTIR studies (Figure 3) conveyed the information on the nature of bonding
in CB, ACB, and LDH synthesized in the presence of ACBs (LDH–ACB),
that is, HBs. As a known fact, the cellulose polymer possesses primary
and secondary hydroxyl groups (1°, 2° −OH), and the
repetitive monomer units of carbon rings are connected via an ether
bond (−O−). The TEMPO oxidation yields −COOH
groups in place of 1°–OH groups and rest of the 2°–OH
remain unaffected. The anionic CBs showed broadband in the region
of 3500–3000 cm–1 corresponding to stretching
of cellulosic −OH bonds and intramolecular hydrogen bonds (X–H).
It is also a known fact that water molecules vibrate in the same region,
hence the peak overlaps between the vibration frequencies of cellulosic
−OH, X–H, and H2O molecules. The peaks at
2893 and 1422 cm–1 asserted the presence of amorphous
as well as crystalline nature in ACBs. A narrow peak at and 1601 cm–1 was due to bending of −OH groups in adsorbed
water. The typical 1155, 102, and 888 cm–1 vibrational
frequencies were results of stretching of C–O–C glycosidic
ether bond, ring C–C bond, and C–O–C stretching
of β-(1 → 4)-glycosidic linkages in cellulose molecule,
respectively.35 The LDH-hybridized ACBs
show similar vibrational frequencies, which are already observed at
3400 and 1611 cm–1 with plain ACBs. The intensity
boost was offered by stretching vibration of free −OH groups
in brucite layers and bending vibration of interlayer H2O molecules of LDH material. The unique peak at 1356 cm–1 was emerged by the asymmetric stretching of carbonate (CO3–) anions bridging between brucite layers. The
vibration pattern at lower wavelengths 775, 573,, 479 cm–1 were characterized as O–M–O, M–OH, M–O–M
bonds (M—Ni, Fe).31

The cross-polarization magic angle
spinning Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic
resonance (CP MAS 13C NMR) supplied the information that
CB contains mainly amorphous cellulose. ACB has disclosed the carbonyl
carbon signal from the carboxylic acid groups, which appeared at 173
ppm35 (Figure 4). The exact level of oxidation cannot be
determined with CP MAS. The HB catalyst sample seemed to contain mainly
inorganics, as the signals were very weak. Despite accumulating 30 000
scans, the spectrum looked noisy, and it was almost impossible to
tell if the carbonyl signal had shifted at all.

Figure 4 NMR spectra of CBs.

Figure 5 shows the
SEM images of the surfaces of CBs and LDH-hybridized ACB (HB). The
freshly prepared CBs show smooth, uniform, and bubble-like or cauliflower-like
surface without any contaminant particles (Figure 5a,b). It was expected that when microcrystalline
cellulose was dissolved in an alkali solution (NaOH, urea) and then
neutralized in acidic medium (HNO3), it would have formed
salts. Nevertheless, there was no sign of salt lumps/crystal formation
across the scanned surfaces. The cross section of the CBs also revealed
a clean uniform surface, which resembled the surface of scooped ice
cream, whereas the morphology of the LDH-precipitated surface of ACBs
(HB) looked rough and grainy (Figure 5d) as against CBs, for the air-dried sample. The high
magnification image (Figure 5e) exhibited the formation of LDH crystals in definite shapes
(e.g., blood platelets) on the surface of ACBs covering them completely.
On the contrary, the cross section of HBs did not show any presence
of LDH crystals (Figure 5f) and it looked similar to the cross section of CBs (Figure 5c). It should be noted here
that the oxidation condition chosen for CBs was controlled in such
a way that it can only oxidize the −CH2OH located
on the external/outer surface of CBs. This way, the LDH deposition
was tuned to be only on the outer surface of ACB via hydrogen bonding.
Thus, the photocatalytically active LDH was made richly available
on the outer surface of the HBs for catalysis. The morphology of the
freeze-dried HB was rough (Figure 5g) at low magnification, whereas at high magnification,
it looked like a porous weblike structure in plant walls and the pattern
was uniform across the surface of the HBs (Figure 5h,i)

Figure 5 SEM images of CBs.

EDX analysis was performed in parallel to scanning of morphology
on the beads (CBs, HBs), in which HBs show a clear presence of Ni
and Fe, that was absent on CBs (Figure 6).

Topochemical Grafting on PFs
Cellulose-based hybrid
materials comprising the inorganic component LDH were used as photon
harvesting catalysts (HB) in order to bring novel functionalities
(acrylate groups) in the cellulose chain. The empirical formula of
LDH is written as [M1–x2+Nx3+(HO–)2]x+[(Xn–)x/n·yH2O]x−. The
catalyst, as named, possesses a layered structure of repetitive positively
charged brucite layers and interconnecting anionic lamellar layers
in between. These layers contain −OH groups and interstitial
crystalline H2O molecules which has the potential to interact
with −OH-rich PFs and electronegatively (O=C–O−)
polarizable EA.

A catalyst is a foreign substance, which increases
the rate of the reaction when it is added to the reaction medium.
A catalyst can either participate in a reaction through chemical bonds
or just act as an active site, to reduce the activation energy barrier
of a given reaction. Heterogeneous catalysts possess active sites
in which the reactants bind/adsorb and are activated to undergo chemical
transformations (bond breaking/making) followed by product desorption.
Here, LDH facilitates the adsorption of PFs and EA on its surface
through weak hydrogen bonding. The bonding was between LDH −OH
groups and cellulosic −CH2OH, >CHOH or −O–,
>C=O (PSA) of EA. In addition, LDH is a well-known photocatalyst,
which can harvest photons from irradiated energy to its surface. Thus,
LDH −OH groups and its surface utilized as active sites to
induce PF and EA radicalization followed by esterification reaction.

The generation of radicals could occur by hydrogen abstraction
from the −CH2OH group in the cellulose chain and
[O=C)···(OC2H5] cleavage
in EA as shown in Figure 7. The photogenerated cellulose radical and acryloyl radical
on the LDH surface recombined to form the cellulose acrylate. This
molecular route allows the newly designed catalyst to graft the hydrocarbon/organic
moieties on the cellulose chain to achieve hydrophobicity and thermoformability
by disrupting hydrogen bonds between the cellulose polymer chains.

Figure 7 Scheme
for the photocatalytic esterification of PFs.

The technique adopted for topochemical functionalization
of PFs
by EA was “hydrogen abstraction–UV photografting”.36 Here, UV radiation is the limiting factor for
the reaction. Therefore, the reaction was controlled mostly like “stop
and go” by switching on/off UV lamp. The reaction steps were
carried out in dark, so that only the irradiated area undergone reaction
and the dark areas remain unreacted. As in most cases, we believe
that hydrogen abstraction is the rate-determining step. The abstraction
of hydrogen preferred at the −OH on the C6 position is due
to limited hindrance around the cellulose chain. In this case, the
cellulose polymer was excited to become a macroradical. This was induced
by the addition of LDH particles as a catalyst, which played their
role as a binding active site and photosensitizer. The enhanced catalytic
efficiency was achieved because of the superficial growth of LDH platelets
over the anionic CBs, which offered more surface-exposed catalytic
active sites for grafting of EA on pulp. In addition, there was no
metal (Ni/Fe) leaching from LDH (catalyst) and LDH leaching from its
anchoring support, ACBs. Hence, the catalyst was stable.

This
photografting method showed advantages in several points such
as (i) easy and controllable introduction of the graft moiety as the
radiation is the limiting reagent for the reaction to happen, (ii)
the bulk properties of the parent material (PFs) remains undamaged,
(iii) ensures covalent attachment of the graft moiety and gives long-term
chemical stability of introduced functional group in contrast to the
physically mixed/coated (composite) material, (iv) the cost of radiation
energy spent for UV radiation was lower than the ionizing radiation,
(v) UV-mediated photocatalysis was environmentally friendly as the
stoichiometric esterification reagents cause waste generation and
pollution, and (vi) above all, the procedure itself is simple and
facile.

Various factors affecting the grafting efficiency on
the PFs was
considered viz., homopolymerization, partitioning effect, and screening
effect. Homopolymerization occurs when the repeating EA monomers chain
grow without attaching to the PFs, that is, −EA to EA–.
The partitioning effect occurs when there is a decreased concentration
of EA available at the grafting site, which makes cellulose and EA
remain unreacted. The screening effect arises when the PFs are not
exposed to UV irradiation due to the increased concentration of PFs
followed by congestion of fibers in solution medium. This was studied
by optimizing the operation concentration as 500 mg/100 mL. Acidic
treatment enhances grafting and hinders homopolymer formation in the
case of homopolymerization and partitioning effect. However, the nature
and choice of the acids are also important. Among many mineral acids,
sulfuric acid is effective, but it also depends on the polymer backbone.
The choice of nitric acid has the possibility or tendency to degrade
cellulose during irradiation. Hydrochloric acid could exert a negative
effect in grafting efficiency, as chlorine could be incorporated in
the final product acrylated PF (APF). Therefore, sulfuric acid was
used in our experiments to enhance the grafting efficiency. The grafting
was carried out in a slightly acidic condition under UV irradiation
for 15–60 min, with a definite amount of catalyst (air-dried
HB). Control experiments for EA grafting on PFs were also performed;
(i) in the absence of the catalyst and UV irradiation unacrylated
PF (UAPF 1), (ii) in the presence of the catalyst without UV irradiation
(UAPF 2), and (iii) in the absence of the catalyst with UV irradiation
(UAPF 3).

Another important aspect to consider is that the mobility
of LDH
in the HB catalyst. To hinder the LDH diffusion inside the pores of
ACB, different drying methods were applied for HB. The closing down
of pores was achieved via air-drying HB, thus LDH diffusing inside
pores was completely arrested which could occur under grafting reaction
conditions. In addition, it made the HB hard and mechanically stable.
The drying experiments were also carried out under a freeze-drying
condition, which is mostly used to obtain high surface area because
of pores not closing down. Nevertheless, later, the HBs became soft
and fragile. When they used in catalytic coupling reaction between
EA and cellulose on PFs, they broke down and became powder, which
made their separation/regeneration difficult from the reaction mixture
(Figure S1). Hence, they have not proven
to be ideal separable heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, drying methods
had a huge influence on LDH mobility viz-a-viz pores in HB and stability
of HB (Figure 5f,i).

Acrylated PFs
The characterization results for the
APF obtained from ATR–FTIR, time of flight–secondary
ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), SEM–EDX, and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA)/differential thermal analysis (DTA) are discussed here
to highlight the gained acrylate groups on the cellulose backbone
and its homogenous distribution.

The ATR–FTIR measurements
were performed to understand the bonding interaction between EA and
PFs (Figure 8). The
new functional group formed during this reaction could be either (cellulose–CH2–O)···C=O–CH=CH2 (acrylate) or (cellulose–CH2–O)···CH2–CH2–COO–C2H5 (an alkyl ether group). The IR spectra of the pulps (UAPF
1), (UAPF 2), and (UAPF 3) showed the peaks similar to that of the
reference PFs without any new peak, indicating that no grafting happened
or was initiated without the catalyst and the UV light source. When
the pulp was treated with a definite amount of catalyst with UV radiation
for 15 min, there appeared a peak for the carbonyl group around 1700
cm–1, confirming that grafting has taken place (APF
1).37 In order to increase the grafting
efficiency, the irradiation time was increased to 60 min. As the duration
of UV irradiation increased, the intensity of the carbonyl group also
increased sharply (APF 2). The TOF-SIMS studies revealed the fragmentation
pattern of APF 2, and the predominant peak (m/z = 55) was found to be the acroloyl radical, (CH2=CH–C*=O), which could have been the potential
intermediate in the formation of cellulose acrylate. The visual images
showed plain fibers in the PF sample, whereas islets of acrylate groups
on fibers as bright spots in the APF 2 sample (Figure 9). Thus, the bonding emerged could be due
to the radical-mediated esterification reaction between the acryloyl
CH2=CH–C*=O group and the cellulosic
−CH2O* group as schematized in Figure 7.

Figure 8 FTIR spectra of the modified
fibers.

Figure 9 TOF-SIMS image of the APF 2.

The morphology of kraft pulp found from SEM images
revealed the
complex weblike fibrous network in reference fibers (PF) (Figure 10a) and modified
fibers (Figure 10c,e).
The low-magnification images (Figure 10c,e) have also shown slight fibrillation on the surfaces
of PFs caused by sulfuric acid/EA environment. The high-magnification
images depicted that the wrinkled surface of the reference fibers
(Figure 10b) have
been smoothened and became a shine-coated surface (Figure 10d,f) after treatment with
EA. The coating difference was seen clearly with 1 h treated fiber
(APF 2) than the 15 min reacted fiber (APF 1) with respect to PF.
This proved that APF 2 had excessive functionalization by the acrylate
group. Thus, the morphology gave indication about EA functionalization/plasticization
on fibers. EDX analysis (Figure 11) was carried out on the spent catalyst and EA-modified
fibers (APF 2) to make sure that the HB catalyst did not undergo any
chemical reaction and there was no leaching of metals. If there is
any chemical reaction between LDH and PFs, there should be a presence
of Ni and Fe in APF 2. The analysis showed that the APF 2 did not
have any metal ions present in it. In other words, it was clear that
the LDH in HBs acted only as a catalyst and does not interfere with
the final product. This ensures that the HB catalyst will not have
any bonding with the feedstock fibers in large-scale applications;
therefore, the final materials will be metal-free, safe, and environmentally
friendly.

APF 2.

Figure 11 EDX spectra of the catalyst and modified
fibers. The spectra reveal
the absence of any metal ions (Ni and Fe, here) in the final modified
fibers. In other words, it is clear that the LDH acts only as a catalyst
and does not interfere with the final product, which will not affect
the applications.

The EA-grafted pulp
(APF) was further analyzed for their thermal
stability using TGAs in order to evaluate the effect of the grafting
on their thermal behavior. The TGA (Figure 12) showed a different weight loss profile
for reference PFs and APF 2. The reference pulp lost its weight in
two instances sequentially (i) at 350 °C corresponding to depolymerization
and the destruction of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen
bonding and (ii) at 480 °C due to the complete decomposition
of cellulose. APF 2 was stable until 250 °C and beyond this temperature,
the weight loss occurred in three consecutive instances: (i) 250–300
°C due to intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding
(minus one −OH group), (ii) 400 °C corresponding to ester
group removal, and (iii) 480 °C due to incineration of the cellulose
backbone in pulp. There was no weight loss observed at 350 °C,
which confirms the absence of the EA homopolymer.38,39 The DTA curves suggested that the weight loss temperatures obtained
in TGA measurements was exactly fitting in, where the temperature
difference was steep high in DTA curves. Thus, both the thermal profiles
were in good agreement and confirmed the decomposition temperatures.

and DTA analysis of the reference (PF) and APF 2.

Hydrophobicity/Water Repellency Behavior of APF
The
water contact-angle (CA) measurements were carried out in order to
evaluate the extent of cellulose acrylate formation in PFs (Figure 13). The more the
acrylate formation, the better was the water CA. The better the CA,
the more suitable it will be for water-proof/oil adhesive applications.
The reference (PF), dissolving pulp (ACel Enocell) was highly hydrophilic
in nature because of inherent −OH groups in cellulose; hence,
water droplets wetted the pulp sheet in a fraction of second and there
was no CA measured. The APFs obtained via control experiments got
wetted swiftly and showed very poor CA (19–20°), whereas
UV-irradiated/HB-catalyzed esterification reactions showed slight
increase in CA (26°) for APF 1, and much improved CA (90°)
for APF 2. Thus, APF 2 avoided wetting by water droplets. This showed
that the APF 2 was largely functionalized by acrylate groups and highly
hydrophobic. Therefore, APF 2 material can be employed in hydrophobic
(water repellency) or lipophilic (oil affinity) applications. Pulp,
paper, packaging, thin film, and textile industries are those that
can become potential exploiters of this biocomposite material if their
technical specification requires high water repellency and oil affinity.
They would benefit from this material as it employs a nonlaborious
synthesis technique, kraft PFs and recyclable eco-friendly catalyst
material, which reduces cost of solvents, radical initiators, and
energy consumption. The final material can be easily made into hand
paper sheet for facile characterization and transport or even pressed
into deep three-dimensional shapes for printed materials applications.
Thus, it could encourage the forest product industries to develop
new materials and support circular economy.

(PF), control (UAPF) and APF. The
water CA of APF 2 remains constant for at least 1 min. 

Conclusions
The
NiFe LDH catalyst particles were made to grow in situ and immobilized
over the surface of anionic CBs (HB) as a novel attempt. The HBs were
applied as heterogeneous catalysts, which made their separation from
the reaction mixture feasible and easy. This way, the catalyst can
be washed and reused multiple times, that made our finding cost-effective.
Hydrophilic pulp was converted into hydrophobic pulp photocatalytically
in kraft PFs. The photon-harvesting HB catalyst facilitated the creation
of radical formation in the cellulose backbone and EA, for the esterification
reaction between cellulose and EA. This successfully brought novel
functionality (acrylate group) covalently anchored to the cellulose
chain (APF) under aqueous conditions and it is reported for the first
time. This tailor-made catalyst system was stable chemically, thermally,
and photonically. When the duration of UV irradiation was increased,
the pulp exhibited higher grafting efficiency and the APF 2 hand sheets
showed better hydrophobicity compared to our previous report. Thus,
grafting acrylate functionality on the cellulose backbone brought
new properties to the PFs for advanced utilization. APF can be used
in water-repellent packaging of goods, food, and groceries (meat,
fish, vegetables, cooked food). The strategic value of the material
could be that it will have the potential to replace the existing nonrenewable
petrochemical-based thermoformable plastic composites with its unique
features such as low cost, hazardless, recyclability, ease of making,
converting harmful EA into nonharmful material and thus fixing the
EA waste problem. These features will have very high impact on cellulose
economy and clean environment. In academy, this study addresses photocatalytic
way of functionalizing inactive −OH groups of cellulose to
form ester, chemical bonding between cellulose and hydrophobic moiety/plasticizer
and its stability. This investigation can also be disseminated to
graft other co-materials like acrylonitrile and acrylic acid on cellulose
covalently. Hence, the economic potential and environmental protection
can be widened.

Materials
Kraft pulp (ACel Enocell)
was obtained from VTT Technical Research
Centre of Finland. Microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH 101), sodium
dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4), sodium hypochlorite
(NaClO), sodium chlorite (NaClO2), TEMPO, EA were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, sodium carbonate
Na2CO3, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 98%, urea (CO(NH2)2), and nitric acid (HNO3) were procured
from Merck and VWR. All the reagents in the synthesis were used as
received and Milli-Q water was used in all the experiments.

Experimental
Methods
Catalyst Preparation
Preparation of Anionic CBs
Microcrystalline
cellulose
was dissolved in 7% NaOH–12% urea–water at −10
°C aiming the final concentration of cellulose 5%. The cellulose
solution was further carefully dropped in a beaker containing 2 M
HNO3 at 25 °C at systematic time intervals and allowed
them to grow into a spherical shape followed by aging to become hard.
The formed beads were kept standing still for a couple of hours and
then washed thoroughly in running tap water for 24 h to ensure complete
neutralization of the CBs. The beads (CB) were then subjected to TEMPO
oxidation using a mixture of TEMPO/NaClO2/NaClO for 5 h
at 40 °C. These oxidized beads were washed thoroughly and stored
in water for further use. These beads are denoted as ACBs.

Synthesis
of an Anionic CB-Supported LDH Catalyst
The
NiFe LDH material was prepared via the co-precipitation method in
the presence of ACBs. To do that, the as-prepared beads were suspended
in solution containing nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O overnight, where
the Ni/Fe ratio was 3:1. Further, this mixture was treated with sodium
carbonate–sodium hydroxide solution for 24 h at pH 9, to form
NiFe LDH and immobilize on the beads in situ. The whole reaction was
performed at room temperature and air atmosphere. Thus, NiFe LDH was
synthesized in the presence of anionic CBs and subsequently, anchored
on these beads uniformly as first of its kind for catalysis purpose.
The ACB-supported LDH material was filtered and washed repeatedly
until neutral pH was reached to remove any mobile LDH particles. The
LDH on ACB were air-dried in one portion and freeze-dried in another
portion for further comparison. The LDH–ACB beads are denoted
as HBs.

Synthesis of Unsupported LDH
The NiFe LDH material
was also prepared in the absence of catalyst support (anionic CBs)
via the abovementioned co-precipitation method by exactly following
the other preparation parameters.

Catalyst Testing
Topochemical
Grafting on PFs
PFs (500 mg) were dispersed
in 100 mL of deionized water. Further, 50 mg of the HB catalyst was
added to this mixture followed by the addition of a small quantity
of scavenger reagent, methyl viologen. The mixture was stirred well
and then 5 mg of plasticizing/hydrophobic organic moiety, EA, was
added. The whole mixture was continued to stir under nonirradiation
conditions and UV light conditions for 15 min, to induce topochemical
functionalization of pulp fibers. The product material was pressed
into sheet and dried at 21 °C temperature in a protective room
with 53% of relative humidity. Similar experiments were performed
without adding catalyst beads in the mixture to study the difference
in grafting on PFs.

Characterization
The synthesized
catalyst materials
and photocatalytically produced APF products were analyzed systematically
using the range of spectroscopic, microscopic, and thermal analytical
techniques.

XRD Spectroscopy
As such, the beads
were macroparticle,
and it was not possible to subject them for the PXRD technique. Therefore,
the beads (pristine and hybrid) were pressed into pellets with a force
of 1 ton using a laboratory press prior to diffraction studies. Then,
the pelleted beads were investigated for PXRD using a Siemens D501
diffractometer with copper Kα radiation (λ = 0.15415 nm).
Patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 5–70°
in steps of 0.04° with a counting time per step of 8 s. The analyses
performed were triplicated to correctly check the reproducibility
of the diffraction from the crushed beads.

ATR–FTIR and Raman
Spectroscopy
ATR–FTIR
spectra were measured in the range 4000–400 cm–1 on a Thermo Scientific, Nicolet iS50 FTIR, Madison, WI, USA, instrument
with a Raman module. It was equipped with a diamond crystal and a
pressure gauge. The beads and APF product material were gently and
carefully placed on the diamond crystal and the IR spectra were recorded.
A total 64 scans were recorded for each sample and corrected by the
OMNIC spectral suite software that provided ambient background. ATR
correction was done for 45° incident angle with 1 refraction
index, assuming a 1.50 refractive index for all samples. Raman measurements
were performed for ACBs using a diode laser as source radiation (P = 0.5 W, λ = 1064 nm) and a gold plate as a sample
holder in order to strengthen the signal. An indium gallium nitride
detector with CaF2 splitter was used. The total number
of scans for each sample was 1024 with the resolution 8.00 cm–1.

Time of Flight–Secondary Ion Mass
Spectrometry
Secondary-ion mass spectra in TOF mode were
obtained for the APFs
using a physical electronics TOF-SIMS TRIFT II spectrometer. The spectrometer
operates with a primary ion beam of the 69Ga+ liquid metal ion source. A raster size of 200 × 200 μm
with the resolution of 256 × 256 pixels was scanned, and at least
five different spots were analyzed. The surface distribution of acrylate
groups was obtained with the best spatial resolution using the ion
gun at 25 kV. The spectra were acquired for 10 min ensuring static
conditions. The electron flood was used to compensate the charge with
respect to the ion gun.

Solid-State CP MAS 13C NMR
CP MAS 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AVANCE-III
HD 400 MHz spectrometer.
The powdered samples of CB, ACB, and HB were spun at a 12 kHz spin
rate in a Bruker 1H broadband double-resonance 4 mm CP MAS probe.
The proton 90° high-power pulse was 2.9 μs with contact
time 2 ms. The recovery delay time was set to 2 s and 30 000
scans were accumulated.

Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy-Dispersive
X-ray
Spectroscopy
A Leo Gemini 1530 field-emission scanning electron
microscope with an in-lens detector (LEO Electron Microscopy Ltd.,
Oberkochen, Germany) was utilized for morphological characterization
of the CB, HB, and APF. The samples were coated on carbon in a Temcarb
TB500 sputter coater (Emscope Laboratories, Ashford, UK). The optimum
accelerating voltage was 2.70 kV. EDX spectra were also obtained using
the same equipment in energy-dispersive X-ray spectra mode.

ThermoGravimetric
Analysis and Differential Thermal Analysis
The thermal behavior
of the samples was studied with a TA Instruments
SDT Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC apparatus between 25 and 600 °C
in a flowing air (flow rate: 100 cm3 min–1). A heating rate of 10 °C min–1 and sample
weight of ca. 10 mg was used. The sample pan was aluminum oxide and
the reference material was an empty aluminum oxide pan.

Water CA Measurements
The hydrophobicity/water repellency
of all the pulp handsheets was assessed by CA measurements. These
were performed with an optical contact angle meter, CAM 200 (KSV Instruments
Ltd., Finland), using deionized water. A water droplet size of 1.6
± 0.2 μL was placed on a 1 × 10 cm sample hand sheet
strip. Then, the CA values were collected at 200 ms intervals in the
beginning and subsequently at 1 and 2 s intervals until either the
water droplet absorbed or no changes during wetting occurred. The
results were analyzed and interpreted with Attention Theta software
(Biolin Scientific, Sweden) based on the Young–Laplace function
for iterative CA calculation.
