Natural
polysaccharide pectin has for the first time been grafted
with polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) via ring-opening polymerization of
β-butyrolactone. This copolymer, pectin-polyhydroxybutyrate
(pec-PHB), was blended with PHB in various proportions and electrospun
to produce nanofibers that exhibited uniform and bead-free nanostructures,
suggesting the miscibility of PHB and pec-PHB. These nanofiber blends
exhibited reduced fiber diameters from 499 to 336–426 nm and
water contact angles from 123.8 to 88.2° on incorporation of
pec-PHB. They also displayed 39–335% enhancement of elongation
at break relative to pristine PHB nanofibers. pec-PHB nanofibers were
found to be noncytotoxic and biocompatible. Human retinal pigmented
epithelium (ARPE-19) cells were seeded onto pristine PHB and pec-PHB
nanofibers as scaffold and showed good proliferation. Higher proportions
of pec-PHB (pec-PHB10 and pec-PHB20) yielded higher densities of cells
with similar characteristics to normal RPE cells. We propose, therefore,
that nanofibers of pec-PHB have significant potential as retinal tissue
engineering scaffold materials.

1 Introduction
A rapidly
expanding world population and concomitant deletion of
resources in the postindustrial era has led to increasing research
on the applications of sustainable materials, such as pectin,1−3 lignin,4−6 cellulose,7 and chitosan.8 One of the most abundant renewable polymers is
pectin; a complex carbohydrate found in higher plants. Pectin consists
mainly of galacturonic acid units joined by α-(1→4) linkages.9 Commercial pectin is obtained by acid extraction
from waste products by the food industry, such as apple pomace, citrus
peel, and sugar beet pulp. It is widely used as a gelling agent, emulsifier,
glazing agent, stabilizer, and thickener in food applications.1 Pectin’s nontoxic, biodegradable, and
biocompatible properties suggest potential as a biomaterial for use
in personal care, pharmaceutical, and biomedical applications.1,9,10

The general insolubility
of pectin in organic solvents stymies
its application in the polymer field.2 Chemical
modification is necessary to overcome this drawback, but most conventional
chemical modifications take place in organic solvents, in which pectin
is insoluble. Previous chemical modifications of pectin were mostly
carried out in water and include methylation,11 acetylation,12 amidation,13 alkylation,14,15 quaternization,16 thiolation,17 sulfation,18 cross-linking,19 grafting,2 and depolymerization.20,21 These pectin derivatives possessed improved physicochemical properties,
including solubility,2 gelling2,11,15 and/or biological characteristics,13 such as anticoagulation18 and bioadhesion.17 In addition, new functionality,
such as emulsifying and emulsion stabilizing,12,19 antimicrobial activity,16 and antioxidant
properties,22 have been discovered. Herein,
we report for the first time the grafting of pectin with PHB via solventless
ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of β-butyrolactone to afford
pectin-polyhydroxybutyrate (pec-PHB), which is soluble in organic
solvents.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a renewable, biodegradable,
and biocompatible
polymer commonly utilized as a biomaterial.23−27 However, the application of PHB in the biomedical
field has been hampered by its hydrophobicity, brittleness, and slow
rate of biodegradation.28 There has, therefore,
been increasing research on blending or grafting PHB with natural
polymers, including alginate,29 carrageenan,30 cellulose,31 and
chitosan.32 The greater hydrophilicity
and biodegradability of pectin could potentially overcome the limitations
of PHB, generating a copolymer with more suitable physical and chemical
properties than each component polymer.

In plants, pectin constitutes
the matrix in which other components,
such as cellulose microfibrils, are embedded and has been shown to
have important roles in regulating the biological and mechanical behavior
of cell walls.1,9,33−35 Inspired by this structural function of pectin in
plants, we have utilized our pectin copolymer as a filler to be blended
with PHB for electrospinning into nanofibers. Electrospinning is a
technique that utilizes electrostatic forces to produce fibers with
diameters in the range of micrometers to nanometers.5,36 Bulk materials can be electrospun to fibers with a porous, three-dimensional
interconnected network structure.37 These
porous matrices have high specific areas, and their nanoscale architectures
may be used to mimic morphological features of the native extracellular
matrix (ECM) for biomedical applications.38−43 Recent reports have demonstrated that nanofibers are promising candidates
for tissue engineering scaffolds.44,45

Ocular
disorders, such as retinal degeneration, can cause impaired
vision and total blindness. Transplantation of retinal cells is a
feasible approach to alleviate these diseases. Achieving good viabilities,
differentiation, and integration of retinal epithelial cells, however,
remains a challenge.46 Recent reports have
proposed the possibility of seeding retinal cells onto soft, polymeric
scaffolds,47,48 which can be made of natural
or synthetic polymers, such as collagen and poly(lactic acid), respectively.49 Natural polymers are able to facilitate cell
signaling and have good biodegradability, but they have drawbacks
such as structure heterogeneity and difficulty in functionalization.50 Synthetic polymers, by comparison, are generally
mechanically stronger, but lack biological functionality.51 Copolymers combining the advantages of both
could have potential for constructing soft frameworks for cell growth.
Our electrospun pec-PHB nanofibers have been evaluated for their potential
as scaffolds for retinal tissue engineering in terms of their topographical,
thermal, and mechanical properties. We also report their biocompatibility
and capacity to support the proliferation and growth of seeded human
retinal pigmented epithelium (ARPE-19) cells.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of pec-PHB
Copolymer
pec-PHB was synthesized from β-butyrolactone
monomer using pectin as initiator by in situ ROP. Polymerization was
carried out in bulk and initiated by the pectin hydroxyl groups in
the presence of catalyst tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (Figure 1). 1H NMR spectroscopy
was performed on pectin (D2O), PHB (CDCl3),
and pec-PHB (CDCl3) (Figures S1–S3). Pectin cannot be dissolved in organic solvents and thus pectin’s
spectra in CDCl3 are not available. The spectra of pec-PHB
contained peaks characteristic of PHB and pectin. Broad proton signals
were observed between 3 and 4 ppm that are attributed to the pectin
moiety, supported by previous reports of the 1H NMR spectra
of modified (persilylated) cyclodextrins in CDCl3, which
concluded that almost all of the carbohydrate ring protons occurred
between 3 and 5 ppm in broad signals.52 To further verify the successful grafting of PHB on pectin, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of pec-PHB displayed absorption
characteristics of both pectin and PHB (Figure 2). The spectrum of pec-PHB contained a hydrogen-bonded
O–H absorption at 3450 cm–1, a fingerprint
absorption at 1010 cm–1 that can be assigned to
pectin,53−55 and C–H absorptions (CH2 and CH3) at around 2950 cm–1, together with C–O–C
vibrations at 1185 cm–1 that match PHB.56,57

polymerization of β-butyrolactone using pectin
as initiator to yield pec-PHB.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of the precursors (pectin and PHB) and copolymer pec-PHB.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
revealed that grafting PHB on
pectin causes a reduction in the degradation temperature (Td) of pec-PHB (246.26 °C) relative to that
of pristine PHB (288.44 °C). Despite reduced thermal stability,
pec-PHB was stable up to 240 °C. The presence of a single decomposition
step represents the successful grafting of PHB on pectin. Like pectin,
pec-PHB has a high residue content (15.31%) (Table S1), possibly due to the presence of sodium and potassium salts
of uronic acid groups.58,59

PHB is a semicrystalline
polymer with melting temperature (Tm)
of 160.98 °C and glass-transition temperature
(Tg) of 8.69 °C. Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed that pec-PHB is fully amorphous
with the disappearance of the melting peak (Figure S4). The amorphous property of pec-PHB also suggests that the
polymerized PHB chains on the pectin backbone are most likely in an
atactic configuration.60 This hypothesis
is further supported by the stronger intensity of the FTIR band at
1185 cm–1 in pec-PHB, which is sensitive to the
amorphous state of PHB (Figure 2).57 The presence of a single Tg for pec-PHB further indicates the successful
grafting of PHB on pectin (Figure S4).
Compared to pristine pectin and PHB, the Tg of the copolymer was lower (−15.41 °C) (Table S1), indicating its increased rubbery nature
and improved chain conformation flexibility and mobility, even at
temperatures lower than 0 °C.61 TGA
and DSC therefore confirmed the successful grafting of PHB on the
pectin backbone.

2.2 Electrospinning of PHB/pec-PHB
Fibers
Through grafting with PHB, pectin in pec-PHB was rendered
soluble
in organic solvents chloroform and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
and could be blended with PHB for further engineering of porous surfaces.
A series of PHB/pec-PHB fibers with different mass ratios were prepared
(Table 1). Pectin content
increased with increasing pec-PHB content in the blend. The influence
of pectin composition on the morphology and fiber diameters of PHB/pec-PHB
are summarized in Figure 3. The fibers exhibited uniform and bead-free nanostructures,
suggesting that PHB and pec-PHB copolymers were miscible on the nanoscale.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed a three-dimensional
porous structure with a microenvironment mimicking the geometry of
the extracellular matrix (ECM). The incorporation of pectin copolymers
was observed to decrease the fiber diameters by up to 32.7% from 499
± 96 nm, with blends of higher pectin composition affording thinner
fibers. The fiber diameters of pec-PHB nanofibers were found to be
within the range of structural extracellular matrix (ECM) fibrous
proteins, which are from 50 to 500 nm,62 rendering pec-PHB nanofibers ideal candidates for tissue engineering.

2.3 Hydrophobicity of PHB/pec-PHB
Nanofibers
Water contact angles of the PHB/pec-PHB nanofibers
were determined
to evaluate the hydrophobicity of the nanostructured surfaces. PHB
nanofibers exhibited a water contact angle of 123.8 ± 1.3°
(Figure 4), and the
addition of pec-PHB copolymers enhanced the hydrophilicity of the
nanofibers, inversely correlated to pec-PHB composition. pec-PHB20
was found to be quite hydrophilic, with a water contact angle of 88.2
± 1.2°. This reduction in the hydrophobicity of the nanofibers
is presumably due to extra hydrogen bonding between water and the
hydroxy groups of the incorporated pectin. Therefore, the hydrophobicity
of PHB can be tuned by pec-PHB to meet the specific requirements of
different applications. In the case of tissue engineering, the fibers
need to maintain a suitable hydrophobic to hydrophilic ratio that
enables both cell adhesion and resident cell hydration.63

(p < 0.05).

2.4 Thermal Properties of PHB/pec-PHB Nanofibers
TGA revealed single-step decomposition of pec-PHB nanofibers, indicating
miscibility between pec-PHB and PHB. Incorporating pec-PHB did not
have a large effect on the thermal stability of PHB/pec-PHB nanofibers,
which can withstand temperatures up to 240 °C. The residue percentages
of the pec-PHB nanofibers directly correlated with the composition
of pec-PHB (Table 2), presumably due to the high residue content of pec-PHB (Table S1).

a Td is
defined as the temperature at which the mass of the sample has a 5%
weight loss, determined by TGA.

b Residue is defined as the mass percentage
of the sample at 500 °C, determined from TGA.

c Tg, Tcc, ΔHcc, Tm, and ΔHm were deduced from the second heating curve by DSC. Tm was taken as peak maxima. ΔHm and ΔHcc were determined
from the endothermic melting peak and exothermic cold crystallization
peak, respectively.

d Xc was
calculated using the following equation  where ΔHmO is a reference
value, which represents the heat of melting for 100% crystalline PHB,
146 J g–1.69Xc values were normalized based on the mass percentage
of PHB segments in the fibers: 100% for PHB, 98% for pec-PHB2, 95%
for pec-PHB5, 90% for pec-PHB10, and 80% for pec-PHB20.

DSC measurements revealed a single Tg for pec-PHB nanofibers (Table 2), confirming the miscibility of pec-PHB
and PHB.64 The Tg and cold
crystallization temperature (Tcc) of pec-PHB
nanofibers were slightly increased relative to pristine PHB (0.07
and 36.32 °C, respectively) and inversely correlated to the composition
of pec-PHB (Table 2). Degree of crystallinity was also inversely correlated with pectin
content (Table 2).
Compared to pristine PHB (50.81%), all pec-PHB nanofibers exhibited
lower degrees of crystallinity, excluding pec-PHB2 (53.21%). The incorporation
of up to 2% of amorphous pec-PHB allows the blend to be rearranged
to a molecular conformation with increased intermolecular cohesive
forces,65 favoring crystallization and
thus a higher degree of crystallinity (53.21%) and Tg (6.76 °C). There was no Tcc observed for pec-PHB2, confirming the stable molecular orientation
of the blend.66 Further increase in pec-PHB
content progressively disperses the PHB chains, increasing segmental
mobility and hindering the crystallization process, and thus lowers
the degree of crystallinity, Tg, and Tcc. Multiple melting peaks for PHB is a common
phenomenon and has been explained by melting, recrystallization, and
remelting of crystals with different lamellar thicknesses and/or structures.67 Melting peaks were gradually convoluted with
increasing composition of pec-PHB (Figure 5), suggesting the nanofibers with increasing
pec-PHB content resulted in more metastable crystals than ordered
crystals.68

fibers: PHB, pec-PHB2, pec-PHB5,
pec-PHB10, and pec-PHB20.

2.5 Mechanical Properties of PHB/pec-PHB Nanofibers
Tensile tests were carried out at room temperature to evaluate
the mechanical properties of pec-PHB nanofibers compared to pristine
PHB nanofibers. PHB nanofibers displayed a Young’s modulus
of 0.15 ± 0.01 GPa, ultimate tensile stress (UTS) of 4.72 ±
0.71 MPa, and elongation at break (εb) of 5.12 ±
0.14%. The proportion of pec-PHB is inversely correlated with Young’s
modulus, UTS, and elongation at break (Table 3). pec-PHB2 displayed the best mechanical
properties with 153% increase in Young’s modulus, 165% increase
in UTS, and 335% enhancement in elongation at break. The next best
was pec-PHB5, which had a Young’s modulus comparable to pristine
PHB, 131% increase in UTS, and 236% enhancement in elongation at break.
These results show that pec-PHB2 was stiffer than pristine PHB nanofibers
and that pec-PHB5 had a similar stiffness to the latter. This is attributed
to increased or similar degrees of crystallinity.70 Further increases of pec-PHB content (above 10 wt %) reduced
the Young’s modulus and UTS of the nanofibers, corresponding
to reduced degrees of crystallinity in pec-PHB10 and pec-PHB20. These
results demonstrated that nanofibers with higher composition of pec-PHB
(above 10 wt %) were less stiff and ductile compared to pristine PHB.
Unlike typical fibers, which display trade-offs between stiffness
and ductility,66 pec-PHB nanofibers were
ductile and possessed a 139–335% enhancement in elongation
at break. pec-PHB2 and pec-PHB5 nanofibers are tougher than pristine
PHB, presumably due to the stable molecular orientation of these blends.66

2.6 ARPE-19 Cell Attachment
and Proliferation
pec-PHB nanofibers were found to be biodegradable,
noncytotoxic,
and biocompatible (Figures S5 and S6).
We further explored the potential of pec-PHB nanofibers in retinal
tissue engineering by studying the attachment and proliferation of
ARPE-19 cells on the nanofibers.

Retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE) is a layer of tissue from the back of the eye.71 RPE plays many complex roles in the eyes, and its degeneration
is related to ocular disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa, that
can lead to vision blindness.71,72 As RPE cells are mostly
nonproliferative, repair, and regeneration of the damaged tissue is
nearly impossible.73 One possible solution
is to culture RPE cells in vitro and induce them to reenter the eye’s
medium in their glycolytic metabolism stage, during which proliferation,
migration, and differentiation are possible.71,72

One of the most commonly used RPE cell lines is ARPE-19, which
displays similar cell morphology and gene expression to native human
RPE cells.74 ARPE-19 cells were seeded
at a density of 1.00 × 104 cells cm–2 onto PHB and pec-PHB nanofibers as scaffolds and glass coverslips
(as control) in a 24-well plate. Quantification of cell proliferation
using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay revealed that growth of ARPE-19 cells on day 1 ((72.11
± 7.50) × 103) and day 3 ((90.85 ± 22.63)
× 103) after seeding was comparable among all five
nanofibers (Figure 6). There was a significant difference in cell growth on day 7 between
the nanofibers as determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
at the p < 0.05 level [F(4,10)
= 3.625, p = 0.045]. Cell density on pec-PHB10 and
pec-PHB20 was higher relative to the other polymer blends. Apart from
higher pectin content, which confers biocompatibility,50 the nanofibers of pec-PHB10 and pec-PHB20 were
smaller in diameter compared to the others. It has previously been
demonstrated that cell viability and proliferation is highest with
thinner, randomly aligned fibers.75 The
reduction in crystallinity achieved with our pec-PHB nanofibers is
also important for cell attachment and proliferation.76 Crystallinity had been shown to decrease cell viability
and proliferation on randomly aligned fibers.77

Figure 6 MTT
assay indicated comparable cell attachment densities on all
groups on days 1 and 3. Values plotted are means ± standard deviations,
with three replicates taken per data point. One-way ANOVA (Tukey post
hoc test) indicated that there was no significant difference between
any groups.

The expression of F-actin,
which is associated with cell junctions,
was assessed using rhodamine phalloidin 24 h after seeding (Figure 7A). The presence
and distribution of F-actin was consistent with the pattern of F-actin
expression in cells seeded on glass. This indicates that ARPE-19 cells
had successfully adhered to the different scaffolds and were actively
proliferating in pristine PHB and pec-PHB nanofibers. SEM analysis
was performed to observe the morphology, adhesion, and proliferation
of ARPE-19 cells (Figure 7B). SEM images were taken 1 day post seeding and revealed
differences in morphology between the nanofibers. Cells on PHB, pec-PHB2,
and pec-PHB5 did not retain the polygonal morphology as distinctively
seen on glass. ARPE-19 cells on PHB10 and PHB20 were more rounded
and localized, similar to the characteristic of normal RPE cells.

3 Conclusions
pec-PHB
copolymer was successfully synthesized via ROP in bulk
using pectin as initiator. Solubility in organic solvents was achieved
by grafting PHB onto pectin. pec-PHB was blended with PHB, and nanofibers
produced by electrospinning were found to be of finer fiber morphologies
with enhanced hydrophilicity, relative to PHB. These engineered nanofibers
also possessed superior mechanical properties relative to pristine
PHB. ARPE-19 cells adhered well and actively proliferated on pec-PHB
nanofibers, demonstrating the potential of this material as a scaffold
for tissue engineering.

4 Materials and Methods
Pectin (from apple), β-butyrolactone, tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate,
and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Solvents chloroform and n-hexane were of ACS grade
and were purchased from J.T. Baker. All chemicals were used as received.

PHB was purified by dissolving in chloroform followed by filtration
and subsequent precipitation in n-hexane before use.
The absolute Mn and Mw of the purified PHB, characterized by miniDAWN multi-angle
laser light scattering (Wyatt Technology) using dn/dc = 0.144, were 6.0 × 104 and
7.1 × 104 g mol–1, respectively.
The apparent Mn and Mw of the purified PHB, characterized by GPC (SEC RI detector)
(Tosoh, Japan) with polymethylmethacrylate calibration standards,
were 2.5 × 105 and 7.6 × 105 g mol–1, respectively.

4.1 Synthesis of pec-PHB Copolymer
pec-PHB
was obtained by ROP using tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate as a catalyst.
The reaction mixture comprised pectin, β-butyrolactone, and
tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (weight ratio, 1:5:0.05). The reaction mixture
was stirred under an inert nitrogen atmosphere at 100 °C for
24 h and left to cool. Chloroform was added, and the resulting mixture
was stirred overnight at 50 °C. The mixture was left to cool
and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. pec-PHB was obtained by
precipitating the supernatant in n-hexane and drying
under high vacuum at 40 °C.

4.2 Characterization
of pec-PHB Copolymer
1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a JEOL 500 MHz NMR spectrometer
(JEOL, Japan) at room temperature. The 1H NMR measurements
were carried out with an acquisition time of 4.37 s, a pulse repetition
time of 9.37 s, and a 90° pulse width. Measurements were performed
with 16 scans, and chemical shifts were referred to the solvent peak
[δ = 4.79 ppm for deuterium oxide (D2O) and δ
= 7.26 ppm for deuterated chloroform (CDCl3)].

Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of potassium bromide (KBr) pellet
samples were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 2000 FTIR spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer); 16 scans were signal-averaged with a resolution of
4 cm–1 at room temperature. Pellet samples were
prepared by mixing each sample with potassium bromide.

Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was performed using TGA Q500 (TA
Instruments). Samples were heated from room temperature to 900 °C
at a rate of 20 °C min–1 under continuous nitrogen
purge with a flow rate of 40 mL min–1.

Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed
using DSC Q100 (TA Instruments) equipped with an autocool accessory
and calibrated using indium. The following protocol was used for each
sample: equilibrate at −60 °C and isothermal for 5 min,
heating to 200 °C at 20 °C min–1 and isothermal
for 5 min, cooling to −60 °C at 20 °C min–1 and isothermal for 5 min, and finally reheating to 200 °C at
20 °C min–1. Data were collected from the second
heating curve.

4.3 Electrospinning of PHB/pec-PHB
Mixtures
A series of PHB and pec-PHB mixtures with various
mass ratios were
dissolved by stirring overnight in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol.
The mass ratios of PHB and pec-PHB with a preset total concentration
of 3% w/v were prepared as shown in Table 1. The solution was loaded in a 5 mL syringe
with a blunt flat-tip 22-gauge needle and pumped out at 1 mL h–1 with 10 kV of voltage applied on the needle. Fibers
were electrospun on a collector wrapped with aluminum foil (≈7.5
cm away from the needle tip). The fibers were left to dry in the fume
hood at room temperature. PHB fibers were fabricated under the same
parameters as the control.

4.4 Characterization of PHB/pec-PHB
Fibers
Surface topographies of the fibers were characterized
using JSM-6700F
field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan). Samples
were sputter-coated with gold before imaging. Micrographs of each
sample were obtained from random locations. The diameters of fibers
were determined from 50 random measurements per image using ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health).

The hydrophilicity of the fibers
was evaluated by sessile water contact angle measurement using an
NRL contact angle goniometer 100-00 (Ramé-Hart). Droplets of
5.00 μL deionized water were sprinkled onto the fibers, and
data were recorded after 10 s. Three samples were used for each composition.

The mechanical properties of the fibers were measured by uniaxial
tensile test using Instron 5943 (Instron) with 100 N load capacity
at a rate of 10 mm min–1 at room temperature. The
fibers were cut into rectangular strips of 5.0 mm × 20.0 mm for
testing. The thickness of the samples was about 0.20 mm, and the gauge
length was 20.0 mm. Three samples were prepared for each composition.
Tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and elongation at break
were calculated on the basis of the stress–strain curve of
each sample.

Thermal behavior of the fibers was investigated
by TGA Q500 (TA
Instruments) and DSC Q100 (TA Instruments) using the same procedure
described above (refer to Section 2.2).

4.5 Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with SPSS Statistic 21 software
(IBM). The statistical significance was evaluated using Tukey post
hoc test at p < 0.05.

4.6 Biodegradability
and Biocompatibility of PHB/pec-PHB
Fibers
4.6.1 Degradation Studies
Fibers were
incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) at
room temperature and lightly shaken at 150 rpm for 2 weeks with PHB
as the control. The PBS solution was changed every 2 days. Surface
topographies of the fibers were characterized using JSM-6700F field
emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) on a weekly basis.
Samples were sputter-coated with gold before imaging. Micrographs
of each sample were obtained from random locations. The fibers were
also incubated in PBS solution at pHs 7.4 and 12.0 at 37 °C to
identify the approximate period required for their complete solubilization.
The PBS solution was changed every 2 days.

4.6.2 CellTiter-Blue
Assay
The fibers
on round slides were UV-sterilized, inserted into 24-well microplates,
and sterilized again. NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC CRL-1658) were cultured
based on standard protocols provided by the American Tissue Culture
Collection (ATCC). Cells grown in culture flasks were seeded onto
24-well microplates at a density of 5000 cells per well. After 72
h, the resazurin (CellTiter-Blue Promega) cell viability assay was
conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 2
h of resazurin incubation, media extracts were transferred onto black
96-well microplates for reading at 560 nm excitation/590 nm emission.
Tissue culture plastic was taken as the standard (viability = 1),
and all readings were normalized accordingly. Higher fluorescence
readings indicate higher cell viability and better biocompatibility.

4.6.3 ARPE-19 Cell Culture
A commercially
available human retinal pigmented epithelium cell line (ARPE-19, CRL-2302)
was purchased from ATCC. Cells were first grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium and Ham’s F12 (D-MEM/F12, 1:1)
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% fetal bovine serum until confluence.
Thereafter, the cells were passaged by trypsin and seeded onto different
fiber scaffolds in 24-well plates at a density of 1.00 × 104 cells cm–2 in the same media for in vitro
experiments. Glass coverslips were used as controls. Cultures were
incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2, and the medium was
changed every 2 days.

ARPE-19 cell viability and proliferation
were tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Molecular Probes), in reference to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In brief, three samples from each group of fibers were
washed at different time points (days 1, 3, and 7 after seeding) and
transferred to a new 24-well plate with fresh culture medium and incubated
in MTT solution (5 mg mL–1) for 4 h at 37 °C.
Dimethyl sulfoxide (500 μL) was then added to each well plate
to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorbance was measured at 560
nm using a microplate reader (Infinite F200, Tecan, Switzerland).
Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software
(GraphPad Software Inc.), and p < 0.05 was regarded
as statistically significant with a 95% confidence interval.

4.6.4 Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry
was performed to certify the growth and distribution of ARPE-19 cells
after 24 h of seeding. ARPE-19 cells on different fibers were incubated
with rhodamine phalloidin (1:50 dilution, Molecular Probes) for 20
min at room temperature. The cells were air-dried and then mounted
with VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories).
All images were taken at random locations with a Axio Imager M1 fluorescence
microscope (Zeiss).

4.6.5 Morphology and Cell Attachment
The morphology and cell attachment of ARPE-19 cells on the scaffolds
were observed by JEM-6330F scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan).
The cells on scaffolds were fixed for 1 h using 3% glutaraldehyde
at 24 h after cell seeding, followed by dehydration with hexamethyldisilazane.
The samples were then air-dried overnight before observation. Micrographs
of each sample were obtained at random locations.
