On account of
the intralayer and interlayer heterogeneity, high temperature (110
°C), and high salinity (224,919 mg/L) of Tahe channel sand reservoir,
single profile control or chemical flooding cannot greatly enhanced
oil recovery. The goal of the current research was to optimize a polymer
gel formula that was suitable for high-temperature and high-salinity
reservoirs, screen an appropriate chemical flooding method, and determine
the efficiency of the combination of profile control and chemical
flooding. Experimental results indicated that the formed polymer gel
could maintain relatively high strength after aging for 30 days. Moreover,
the combination of profile control and surfactant flooding could result
in an enhanced oil recovery of 17.9%, and the combination of profile
control and foam flooding could result in an enhanced oil recovery
of 23.0%, which was ascribed to the improvement of sweeping efficiency
and displacement efficiency. All the results indicated that the formed polymer gel and the combination
of profile control and chemical flooding have great application potential
in Tahe high-temperature and high-salinity channel sand reservoir.

1 Introduction
At present, excess water
production and low recovery factor are
the main problems faced by Tahe high-temperature (110 °C) and
high-salinity (224,919 mg/L, containing 8895 mg/L Ca2+ and
821 mg/L Mg2+) channel sand reservoir, which are caused
by the existence of evident water channeling in the middle of the
channel and the difficult activation of remaining oil in both sides
of the channel. How to effectively control water production and consolidate
oil production is the main task.

Commonly, chemical flooding
technologies are applied to water control
and oil production boost, such as polymer flooding, surfactant flooding,
alkaline flooding, polymer/surfactant (PS) flooding, alkaline/surfactant/polymer
(ASP) flooding, and foam flooding.1−5 Different chemical flooding technologies are suitable for different
reservoir conditions. For example, polymer flooding and polymer-based
flooding technologies are applicable in medium–low-temperature
and low-salinity reservoirs due to the limited temperature resistance
and salt tolerance properties of polymers.6 Alkaline flooding will cause serious scaling, which will damage
low permeability formation. Although foam flooding can be implemented
at high-temperature and high-salinity reservoirs, its sealing performance
is poor in strong heterogeneity reservoirs, and foam will be output
along high permeability channels.7 Some
novel surfactants can effectively improve displacement efficiency
under high-temperature and high-salinity reservoirs, while the viscosity
of surfactant solution is similar to that of formation water, and
channeling occurs during the displacement process under the condition
of strong heterogeneity.8

To effectively
expand sweep efficiency and further enhance oil
recovery, polymer gel treatment is proposed to reduce water cut by
sealing the thief zone and diverting injection fluid.9−12 Many polymer gels are developed including in situ monomer gel, in
situ polymer gel, and particle gel.13−15 For in situ monomer
gel, the initial viscosity of monomer and cross-linker solution is
similar to that of formation water, and it can access into the in-depth
reservoir theoretically. However, the gelation time is uncontrollable
in high-temperature reservoirs for monomer gelation is a free-radical
initiated process. Also, the system contains high monomer concentration
(4–10%) to maintain gel strength under high-temperature and
high-salinity conditions, leading to high operation cost. Moreover,
the penetration of the system into low permeability causes low permeability
formation damage.1 For in situ polymer
gel, since it was proposed by Philips in the 1970s, it has been widely
applied for conformance control.16 The
commonly used polymers include polyacrylamide (PAM), partially hydrolyzed
polyacrylamide (HPAM), xanthan and guar, and so on. These polymer
molecules are connected by cross-linkers to form three-dimensional
(3D) networks with a unique liquid-like characteristic on a molecular
length scale and liquid-like characteristic on a macroscopic scale.
However, due to the single repetitive unit and linear structure of
PAM and HPAM, their antishearing properties, temperature tolerance,
and salt resistance properties are poor, which may reduce gel strength
and even lead to failure of gelation after the system enters into
porous media.17,18 Due to the biodegradation of
xanthan and guar, the long-time stability of gels is poor.

The
main objective of this study is to prepare a novel anti-high-temperature
and high-salinity polymer gel and select a suitable chemical flooding
method to improve sweep efficiency and displacement efficiency. First,
the functional polymer was optimized according to polymer performances,
such as temperature tolerance, salt tolerance, antishearing performance,
and gelling properties. Then, the optimal polymer formula was determined
according to gel properties. Then, the effect of salinity, temperature,
pH, and aging time on gel performance was evaluated. Subsequently,
core flooding experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of
profile control combined with chemical flooding on enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) under Tahe channel sand reservoir conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization of Gel Formula
2.1.1 Optimization of Polymer Type
The
gel that was prepared using a functional polymer is suitable for high-temperature
and high-salinity conditions and has good economic benefits; therefore,
it is essential to screen polymers with favorable salt resistance
and temperature tolerance properties, antishearing properties, and
gelling properties.

2.1.1.1 Temperature Endurance
The temperature
endurance of polymers in fresh water is shown in Figure 1. The viscosity of polymer
solution decreased with the increase in temperature. For KY-5SH, due
to the mutual repulsion between hydrophilic and lipophilic groups,
the curl and entanglements among intramolecules and intermolecules
weakened, and polymer chains arrayed in a comb shape in aqueous solution,
which enhanced the rigidity of molecular chains and regularity of
the molecular structure.19 When the temperature
was increased to 95 °C, the viscosity of KY-5SH solution was
285.1 mPa·s with a viscosity retention ratio of 59.9%; the highest
viscosity of HY-5SH was ascribed to the highest molecular weight and
hydrolysis, while the flexible molecular chains indicated poor temperature
tolerance. For polymers that were supplied by the SNF group, the introduction
of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS) in molecular
chains enhanced the molecular hydrodynamic volume at high temperatures,
resulting in the enhancement of temperature endurance.20 Moreover, with the increase in molecular weight,
the viscosity of polymer solution increased at high temperatures with
higher viscosity retention ratio. AN391 and AN125SH exhibited favorable
temperature resistance with viscosity retention values of 70.2 and
70.4%, respectively at 95 °C.

Figure 1 Apparent viscosity of polymer as a function
of temperature (c = 3000 mg/L).

2.1.1.2 Salt Resistance
Brine was prepared
by mixing formation water and deionized water in different proportions.
The effect of salinity on polymer viscosity is illustrated in Figure 2. With the increase
in salinity, viscosity decreased sharply first and then tended to
be constant. In deionized water, the repulsive forces among negatively
charged polymer chains endowed polymers with favorable thickening
ability. With the increase in salinity, the diffused double layer
was compressed by metal cations, negative electricity of polymer chains
was reduced, and polymer molecules curled to form compact random cluster;
thus, polymer solution viscosity was reduced.21 When salinity was 11 × 104 mg/L, AN391 and AN125SH
exhibited favorable salt tolerance with viscosity retention values
of 12.9 and 12.3%, respectively.

Figure 2 Effect of salinity on viscosity (c = 3000 mg/L).

2.1.1.3 Antishearing Performance
The
antishearing performance of polymer solution was determined by the
change in viscosity after shearing at 3000 rpm for different times
using a Wuyin agitator, and the results are shown in Figure 3. When the polymer solution
was subjected to mechanical shearing, molecular chains were broken
and molecular weight and mechanics volume decreased, resulting in
the decrease in solution viscosity. Meanwhile, the longer the shearing
time, the greater the loss of polymer viscosity. After comparison,
it was found that the viscosity retention ratio of AN125SH was the
highest after shearing and showed favorable shear resistance property.

performance of polymers.

2.1.1.4 Cross-Linking
Properties
The
cross-linking properties of polymers were evaluated and the optimal
polymer was determined according to the gel properties under the condition
of 110 °C. First, 3000 mg/L polymer solution was prepared by
dissolving polymer particles into 5.6 × 104 mg/L simulated
formation water. Then, FQ-1 and thiourea as stabilizers were added
into the polymer solution with concentrations of 1000 and 50 mg/L,
respectively. Subsequently, the properties of gel were measured, and
the results are tabulated in Table 1. The gels that formed with different molecular weights
and hydrolysis showed different properties. With the increase in molecular
weight, gelation time shortened and gel strength was enhanced. KY-5SH
had the highest molecular weight and final strength, while stability
was poor and the gel was dehydrated after aging for 20 days. The strength
of gel that formed with AN391 weakened by thermo-oxidative degradation,
and the final strength was B. The molecular weights of AN191 and SAV522
were relatively low, the gelation time was 5 days, the gel strength
was weak, and gel was hydrated after aging for 20 days. For AN125SH,
it had favorable temperature and salt tolerance due to the introduction
of the sulfonate group, its gelation time was 4 days, and its final
strength was E. After aging for 20 days, it was not dehydrated and
its gel strength was maintained at D. Based on the evaluation experiments,
AN125SH was selected as the main agent of gel.

2.1.2 Optimization of Cross-Linker Type
Cross-linker was optimized by the following procedures. First, 3000
mg/L polymer solution was prepared by dissolving polymer particles
into 5.6 × 104 mg/L simulated formation water. Then,
cross-linker and stabilizer were added into the polymer solution with
concentrations of 1000 mg/L and 50 mg/L, respectively. Subsequently,
the properties of gel were measured and the results are tabulated
in Table 2. The strength
of gel that formed by formaldehyde and AN125SH was weak and its long-time
stability was poor. After aging for 10 days, the gel strength was
reduced to B, which was ascribed to the C–N bonds that formed
by the interaction between formaldehyde and acylamino group was easily
destroyed at high temperature conditions, resulting in the decrease
in gel strength. FQ-1 and FQ-2 not only had part of formaldehyde cross-linking
effect but also had a polyhydroxymethyl phenol cross-linking reaction.
Moreover, the introduction of benzene ring in gel enhanced covalent
bonds’ strength and provided better temperature tolerance than
the formaldehyde system. While the phenol content in FQ-1 was higher
than that of FQ-2, resulting in better performance of the FQ-1 system
than FQ-2. For the FEI system, the gel strength was high, while both
of them were dehydrated after 20 days. Ultimately, FQ-1 was optimized
as a cross-linker.

2.1.3 Optimization of Polymer
Concentration
The AN125SH concentration was optimized under
the conditions of
a stabilizer concentration of 50 mg/L and FQ-1 concentration of 1000
mg/L, and the results are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. With the increase
in AN125SH concentration, gelation time decreased and gel strength
was enhanced. The increase in polymer concentration increased reaction
active points, and the more polymer molecules were cross-linked in
the same time, macroscopically manifesting the shorter gelation time
and stronger gel strength.22 After aging
for 60 days, the gel strength slightly decreased while no dehydration
was observed. With the increase in polymer concentration, the decomposition
of molecular chains slowed down, resulting in the enhancement of gel
stability. In order to realize long-time profile control, 4000–8000
mg/L AS125SH was optimized due to the benign fluidity.

2.1.4 Optimization
of Cross-Linker Concentration
Cross-linker concentration
was an important evaluation index for
gel performance. When cross-linker concentration was too low, the
gel strength was too weak and even no cross-linked networks were formed.
Meanwhile, the gelation time was too short and even dehydration occurred
when the cross-linker concentration was too high.23 FQ-1 concentration was optimized under the conditions of
an AS125SH concentration of 6000 mg/L and stabilizer concentration
of 50 mg/L, and the results are shown in Figure 4 and Table 5. With the increase in cross-linker concentration,
gelation time shortened and gel strength was enhanced. When the mass
ratio of AN125SH and FQ-1 ranged from 3:5–3:4, the gel had
benign properties with a gelation time range of 66–72 h and
gel strength of 5.3–9.6 Pa. When the FQ-1 concentration increased
from 15,000 to 20,000 mg/L, gel strength weakened and was even dehydrated.
The optimal FQ-1concentration range was 8000–10,000 mg/L.

2.1.5 Optimization of Stabilizer
Concentration
Thiourea as a stabilizer could react with oxygen
in a system and
weaken thermo-oxidative degradation of polymer before the gel was
formed; therefore, long-time stability was improved. The optimal stabilizer
concentration was determined under the conditions of AN125SH concentration
of 6000 mg/L and FQ-1 concentration of 10,000 mg/L, and the results
are shown in Figure 5 and Table 6. The
addition of stabilizer had no obvious effect on gel strength and gelation
time, while it evidently enhanced the gel’s long-time stability
at high-temperature and high-salinity conditions. However, when the
stabilizer concentration exceeded 200 mg/L, gel strength and long-time
stability slightly weakened. Hence, the optimal stabilizer concentration
was 50–100 mg/L.

The gel formula was obtained
through the above experiments, which
included (4000–8000 mg/L) AN125SH + (8000–10,000 mg/L)
FQ-1 + (50–100 mg/L) stabilizer. In the following experiments,
the gel formula that include 6000 mg/L AN125SH + 8000 mg/L FQ-1 +
50 mg/L stabilizer was applied.

2.2 Properties
of Gel
2.2.1 Effect of Salinity on Gel Performance
Effects of salt type and concentration on gel properties were investigated,
and the results are shown in Figure 6. With the increase in metal cation concentration,
gel strength weakened and gelation time shortened. Polymer molecules
were relatively stretched in low-salinity water, and more cross-linking
points could react with the cross-linker, resulting in relatively
high strength of the gel. With the increase in metal cation concentration,
the double layer of polymer molecules was compressed, and polymer
molecules curled, leading to the decrease in cross-linking point that
involved in the reaction, increase in gelation time, and decrease
in gel strength. Also, the effect of Ca2+ on gel performance
was more obvious, which was ascribed to the fact that the compress
effect of Ca2+ on the double layer was stronger than that
of Na+.

Figure 6 Effect of salinity on gel properties.

The effect of simulated formation water salinity on gel strength
is tabulated in Table 7. When salinity exceeded 11.3 × 104 mg/L, gel was
dehydrated after aging for 30 days, and gel was stable after aging
for 60 days when salinity was lower than 5.6 × 104 mg/L. The lower the salinity, the more stable the gel.

2.2.2 Effect
of Temperature on Gel Performance
The effect of temperature
on gel performance was studied and the
results are shown in Figure 7. With the increase in temperature, gelation time evidently
shortened, while gel strength was first enhanced and then weakened.
As temperature increases, the thermal movement of molecular chains
was intensified and the probability of intermolecular collisions was
enhanced, leading to the decrease in gelation time24,25 However, the 3Dnetwork of the gel would be destroyed at high temperatures,
and molecular chains were oxidized and broken, resulting in the drop
in gel strength.

Figure 7 Effect of temperature on gel properties.

2.2.3 Effect of pH on Gel Performance
The effect of pH on gel performance was investigated, and the results
are shown in Table 8. With the increase in pH, gelation time decreased, while gel strength
increased first and then decreased. Also, when the pH value was above
9, gel was not formed. The stability of gel that formed under strong
acid conditions was poor for the formation of thermoplastic resin,
which reacted with the acylamino group and formed a linear cross-linking
structure with the characteristics of high strength and crispness.
Under alkaline conditions, polymers underwent severe hydrolysis.15,26,27 With the increase in hydrolysis
degree, amide groups that were involved in the reactions decreased,
leading to the decrease in gel strength and even nongelling.

2.2.4 Long-Time Stability
The changes
in gel strength in high-temperature and high-salinity conditions are
illustrated in Figure 8. With the extension of aging time, gel strength decreased to 2.0
Pa after aging for 80 days. As showsn in Figure 9, after aging for 80 days, the strength was maintained at F.

2.3 Microstructure
The microstructure
of the gel, which was aged for 5 days, is shown in Figure 10. It could be observed that
the evident network structure was formed. As shown in Figure 10a, the network was compact
with thick backbone. After the microstructure was further magnified,
it was found that salt particles adsorbed on the skeleton of networks.
Moreover, a “spider web” network was covered on the
skeleton, which evidently increased the network structure density.
The dual network structure endowed the gel with favorable stability
in high-temperature and high-salinity conditions (Figure 10b).

2.4 Profile
Control Combined with Chemical Flooding
Experiments
2.4.1 Profile Control Performance
of the Gel
The profile control performance of the gel is
shown in Figure 11. In water flooding
development, 66.21% of crude oil was recovered, which was produced
from the high-permeability zone in the second layer and third layer.
During gel injection, the gel preferentially entered into the high-permeability
zone of the second layer and part of gel entered into the high-permeability
zone of the third layer. In subsequent water flooding, injection water
entered the third layer and activated the low-permeability zone first
and then entered into high-permeability zone of the second and third
layers with an enhanced oil recovery of 13.09%.

Figure 11 Profile control performance
of the gel.

2.4.2 Combination
of Gel Treatment and Chemical
Flooding
For foam flooding, 3000 mg/L AOS was used as a foaming
agent and 1000 mg/L KY-5SH was employed as a foam stabilizer with
a gas–liquid ratio of 2:1. The initial foam volume was 620
mL and the foam half-life time was 14 min; the interfacial tension
(IFT) between crude oil and AOS/KY-5SH solution was 0.29 mN/m. For
surfactant flooding, the IFT between crude oil and KPS solution was
0.036 mN/m.

The changes in water cut and oil recovery during
the displacement process are depicted in Figures 12 and 13. During water
flooding, 62.4–64.4% of crude oil was recovered. After the
profile control was implemented, 4.5–4.8% of oil recovery was
enhanced, which was ascribed to the plugging of high-permeability
zone in the second layer and the activation of crude oil in the high-permeability
zone in the third layer. For surfactant flooding, when the surfactant
solution bypassed the plugging, it entered into the high-permeability
layer again due to the viscosity of surfactant solution was similar
to that of formation water, and the seepage resistance of the high-permeability
layer was the lowest. Nonetheless, 8.5% of oil recovery was produced,
which was ascribed to the enhancement of displacement efficiency due
to the low IFT. For foam flooding, after foam was injected, it entered
into high-permeability zone in the third layer first and then part
of foam entered into the high-permeability zone in the second layer;
during the subsequent water flooding, the foam migrated into in-depth
of the model and control profile, the first layer were activated,
and ultimately, 12.4% of oil recovery was boosted.

treatment combined with surfactant flooding.

3 Conclusions
A novel polymer gel was formed, and a combination of profile control
and chemical flooding was systemically studied in this study. The
novel polymer gel could maintain relatively high strength at high-temperature
and high-salinity reservoir conditions, and the combination technology
could sufficiently improve heterogeneity. The profile control ability
of gel in the high-permeability layer and foam in the high-/middle-permeability
layer synergistically adjusted the profile, resulting in the expansion
of sweep volume. Moreover, the reduction in IFT synergistically enhanced
displacement efficiency. Based on the experimental results, the following conclusions were
drawn.

(1) Gel formula was optimized and the formula contained:
(4000–8000
mg/L) AN125SH + (8000–10,000 mg/L) FQ-1 + (50–100 mg/L)
stabilizer.

(2) Single profile control and subsequent water
flooding could
result in an enhance oil recovery of 13.09%; the combination of profile
control and surfactant flooding and the combination of profile control
and foam flooding could result in enhanced oil recovery values of
17.9 and 23.0%, respectively. For the reservoir where intralayer and interlayer heterogeneity
were contemporarily existing, the synergistic effect of profile control
and in-depth profile modification and flooding had better displacement
efficiency for the improvement of sweeping efficiency and displacement
efficiency.

cross-linker and stabilizer were added into deionized water or formation
water at ambient temperature. Then, polymer stock solution was added
into the system under stirring condition until the solution was uniform.
Subsequently, the solution was heated to 110 °C in a high-temperature
oven. The gel formula was optimized according to gel strength, and
rheological and bottle methods were employed to measure gel strength.
Gel strength in the rheological method was denoted as the elastic
modulus that was measured by an Anton Paar MCR302 rheometer. Gel strength
in the bottle method was expressed as an alphabetic code of A through
I, which is shown in Table 11.28,29

Table 11 Gel Strength Code
alphabetic
code	description	
A	The viscosity of gel is
similar to that of polymer solution, and nondetectable gel is formed	
B	The viscosity of gel is
slightly higher than that of polymer solution	
C	Most of the gel flows to
the other end of the bottle when the bottle is turned over	
D	A small portion (5–10%)
of the gel cannot flow to the bottle end by gravity upon inversion
(tonguing sharped)	
E	A significant portion of
gel cannot flow by gravity upon inversion	
F	The gel does not flow to
the bottle end by gravity upon inversion	
G	The gel can flow to the
middle of bottle by gravity upon inversion	
H	Only the surface of gel
slightly deforms by gravity upon inversion	
I	No deformation occurs by
gravity upon inversion	
4.4 Microstructure of Gel
The microstructure
of gel was observed using a Quanta 200 FEI environmental scanning
electron microscope (ESEM).

4.5 Three-Dimensional Model
Displacement Experiments
A three-dimensional plate model
was designed and assembled with
a length of 14.4 cm, width of 14.4 cm, and height of 10.5 cm, as shown
in Figure 14. The
experimental procedures were as follows. (1) In the middle of the
model, three different permeability layers (80 mD, 800 mD, and 300
mD) were prepared by filling quartz sand with sizes of 140–200,
20–40, and 80–100mesh, respectively. The low-permeability
areas on both sides of the model were filled with quartz sand with
a size of 140200mesh. The thickness of each layer was 3.5 cm. (2)
The model was saturated with formation water by injecting formation
water from wells #1, #2, #4, #6, and # 5 and outputting from well
#3. (3) Crude oil was injected into the model from wells #1, #2, #4,
#6, and #5 and produced from well #3 to establish original oil saturation.
(4) Water flooding (WF) was conducted by injecting water from well
#1 and producing from #4 until the water cut reached to 98%. (5) A
0.3 PV gel system was injected (the injection volume was referred
to the literature30), and it was placed
for 24 h.30 (6) If chemical flooding would
not be conducted, subsequent water flooding would be conducted, and
if chemical flooding would be conducted, chemical flooding would be
conducted followed by subsequent water flooding, such as foam flooding
and surfactant flooding. All the displacement
experiments were carried out with an injection rate of 0.5 mL/min
and temperature of 110 °C.
