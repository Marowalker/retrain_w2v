Collagen-based bio-hydrogels
are undoubtedly a hot spot in the
development of biological dressings for wound healing promotion. Herein,
glutamine transaminase (TGase), a biological nontoxic cross-linker
with high specific activity and reaction rate under mild conditions,
was utilized for the self-catalytic cross-linking of the regenerated
collagen (COL) fibril hydrogel fabricated through a molecular self-assembly
method. The results showed that the natural triple helical conformation
of COL remained completely integrated after self-catalytic cross-linking
TGase, which was definitively the fundamental for maintaining its
superior bioactivity. It was worth noting that TGase could promote
the self-assembly process of COL building blocks into a higher order
D-period cross-striated structure. Also, the reconstructed TGase cross-linked
COL fibrils exhibited a higher degree of interfiber entanglements
with more straight and longer fibrils. Meanwhile, the thermal stability
of COL was significantly improved after introducing TGase. Besides,
the cytocompatibility analysis suggested that the regenerated COL
fibril hydrogel showed excellent cell growth activity and proliferation
ability when the dosage of TGase is less than 40 U/g. Further, animal
experiments indicated that the targeted COL fibril hydrogel could
significantly promote skin wound healing, exhibiting better capacity
of skin tissue for regeneration than the COL hydrogel untreated as
expected. Therefore, the reconstructed TGase cross-linked COL fibril
hydrogel could serve as a novel soft material for wound healing promotion.

==== Body
Introduction
Collagen (COL) is a major component of
the extracellular matrix
and widely presented in connective tissues.1 Due to its natural and unique triple helical structure, COL has
distinct functional properties, such as excellent biocompatibility,
hemostatic properties, biodegradability, and induction of cell growth
and differentiation, which has been widely used in cosmetics, biomedical
materials, tissue engineering, wound healing, and other fields.2−5 Studies have shown that, as a biomedical material, COL can activate
the expression of characteristic groups of cells and promote the adhesion
and growth of cells.6−8 Therefore, COL-based medical materials are considered
to be the most promising substrates for biomedical applications. As
one application, COL hydrogel is a promising scaffold material owing
to its excellent properties of water retention and the ability to
maintain a spherical morphology of encapsulated cells and promote
tissue regeneration,9 exhibiting a promising
soft biomaterial for medical dressing, drug delivery, and tissue engineering.10

COL could spontaneously self-assemble
into hydrogels with aligned
fibril structures at physiological conditions, mimicking the structure
and biofunctionality of biological tissues from the nanoscopic to
macroscopic length scales. However, these spontaneous hydrogels suffer
from the relatively weak mechanical properties, inferior stability
(thermostability and structural stability) in vivo, inadaptable enzyme
degradation, etc. Therefore, an additional cross-linking step is extremely
required to enhance the natural physicochemical performances of COL.
Many different methods exist for the improvement of the natural physicochemical
performances of COL in vivo, including physical modification, chemical
modification, and biological modification. Thereinto, chemical cross-linking
methods are more diverse and mostly used. Up to date, many synthetic
or natural derived cross-linkers, including formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde,
polyepoxy compounds, genipin, cyanamide, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride, have been broadly utilized for the chemical modification
of collagen-based biomaterials. Unfortunately, the cytotoxicity and
ability to significantly improve the physicochemical properties of
these cross-linkers could not be met simultaneously, which has restricted
their potential applications seriously. Physical methods include dehydrothermal
treatment (DHT), and ultraviolet radiation (UV irradiation), among
others. DHT treatment universally requires a longer reaction time
when compared to UV irradiation, which consequently increases the
possibility of COL degradation; however, UV irradiation is only effective
for thin or transparent materials. Although all of these methods can
increase the tensile strength of the material, they cause the natural
structure of the COL to be broken to varying degrees. Furthermore,
the physical methods result in weaker bonds compared with the chemical
methods and require a long reaction time.11 Biological modification is a highly efficient and nontoxic method
to promote COL stabilization through the addition of enzymes. The
biomass enzymes have several advantages, including specificity, mild
reaction conditions, and biodegradability. Avoiding the introduction
of a toxic cross-linker is important; thus, biological modification
is an ideal mode of action for COL-based medical materials.

Transglutaminase (TGase), a nontoxic cross-linker with high specific
activity and reaction rate under mild conditions, has been widely
used for the cross-linking of protein. To date, it has been applied
in the fields of medicine,12 food,13 and tissue engineering.14 TGase, widely found in animals, plants, and microorganisms, is composed
of 331 amino acids and has a cysteine residue site as the active center
of the monomeric protein.15 It has been
reported that TGase could mainly catalyze the acyl transfer reaction
between the γ-carboxamide group (acyl donor) of the glutamine
residue and the ε-amino group (acyl acceptor) of the lysine
residue in the collagen peptide chains, thus resulting in the intermolecular
and intramolecular formation of ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine
covalent bonds.16 Furthermore, the cross-linking
reaction of microorganism-derived TGase and collagen can improve the
stability and mechanical strength.17 Therefore,
TGase could serve as an ideal biological cross-linker to improve the
physicochemical properties of collagen. However, the studies rarely
evaluate the effects of TGase on the fibrillogenesis of collagen and
the microtopography of the resulting regenerated collagen fibrils.18−20 Meanwhile, the feasibility of collagen after cross-linking TGase
for promising applications in wound healing promotion still remains
unknown.

Herein, a series of self-assembled COL fibril hydrogels
cross-linked
by different concentrations of TGase as the nontoxic biocatalyst and
cross-linker were obtained. The effects of TGase on the fibrillogenesis
process, thermostability, and microstructure of COL were synthetically
investigated. Furthermore, the cytocompatibility in vitro and histocompatibility
in vivo of the resulting cross-linked collagen fibril hydrogel has
been evaluated. Our aim is
to fabricate the self-cross-linking COL fibril hydrogel for potential
applications as soft materials for wound healing promotion.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
The porcine type I COL was self-prepared
according to our previous report,21 and
microbial transglutaminase was purchased from Shanghai Yuanye BioTechnology
Co., Ltd., China. Unless noted otherwise, all the reagents used in
the experiment are all analytical grade.

Preparation of the Self-Catalytic
Cross-Linked COL Fibril Hydrogel
According to the properties
of TGase under aqueous phase,15 the TGase
self-catalytic cross-linked COL conditions
are as follows: the COL was prepared into a 2 mg/mL COL solution (pH
7.0), the temperature and reaction time was 25 °C and 6 h, respectively,
and the enzyme dosages were 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 U/g (U/g collagen).
After the reaction was complete, the cross-linked COL solution was
cultivated at 37 °C for 1 h to prepare the regenerated COL fibril
self-assembled hydrogel. In addition, the cross-linked COL sponge
was obtained by vacuum freeze-drying under the temperature of −20
°C for further testing. Scheme 1 shows the molecular interactions between TGase and
COL and the effects of TGase on the fibrillogenesis of COL, which
indicates that TGase mainly catalyzes the acyl transfer reaction between
the γ-carboxamide group (acyl donor) of the glutamine residue
and the ε-amino group (acyl acceptor) of the lysine residue
in the collagen peptide chains, thus resulting in the intermolecular
and intramolecular formation of ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine
covalent bonds. Scheme 1 also presents that TGase could further promote the self-assembly
of COL building blocks into a higher-order D-period cross-striated
structure, which is confirmed in the fibrillogenesis process analysis.

and the Effects of TGase on the Fibrillogenesis of COL
Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Analysis
The secondary
structure of the cross-linked COL sponge was analyzed by an FT-IR
spectrophotometer in the 4000–500 cm–1 range
(PerkinElmer Company, England). One hundred milligrams of KBr crystal
and 2 mg of the sample were mixed and then compressed into flakes.
The measurements were carried out in a dry atmosphere (relative humidity:
<65%) at room temperature (21 ± 1 °C). All spectra were
collected in the wavelength range of 4000–500 cm–1 and recorded by transmission mode with a 4 cm–1 resolution time and 32 scans.

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Analysis
The self-catalytic
cross-linked COL fibril hydrogel was re-dissolved in a solution of
0.05 M acetic acid and then prepared into a sample liquid with a concentration
of 0.1 mg/mL. Before the test, the sample liquid was placed in a biological
incubator at 25 °C for 1 h and measured by a circular dichromatic
spectrometer (Jasco, J-810, Japan) in the wavelength range of 190–260
nm at 25 °C. The corresponding molar ellipticity was collected
at the rate of 20 nm/min.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Analysis
The
thermal degradation process and thermal phase transition temperature
of the cross-linked COL sponges were analyzed by differential scanning
calorimetry (Netzsch DSC 2000PC, Germany). Three to five milligrams
of freeze-dried samples was sealed in the DSC aluminum crucible and
heated at the speed of 10 °C/min over the range of 20–140
°C under a nitrogen flow of 60 mL/min. Besides, the empty crucible
was used as the reference.

Fibrillogenesis Process of TGase-COL Solutions
The
COL was dissolved in 10 mM PBS solution (containing 110 mM NaCl) at
pH 7.0 and prepared into a COL solution with a concentration of 1
mg/mL. Then, the different concentrations of TGase was added to the
COL solution and stirred magnetically for 4 h. After the solution
was thoroughly mixed, it was poured into a cuvette. In order to investigate
the effect of TGase on the fibrillogenesis process of COL, the turbidity
of the mixed solution was monitored at 313 nm by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer
(Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 UV/VIS, US) at 37.0 ± 0.1 °C.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Morphology
The self-catalytic
cross-linked COL fibril hydrogel was diluted with 0.1 M acetic acid
into a sample solution with a concentration of 20 μg/mL, and
5 μL of sample solution was dropped to the mica tablet. The
mica tablets carrying the samples were directly placed on the AFM
(SPM-9600, SHIMADZU Co., Ltd.) sample table after drying naturally
at room temperature, and the observation was set in a noncontact tapping
mode. The force constant is 2.8 N/m, the scanning frequency is 1 Hz,
the probe microcantilever length is 180 μm, and the tip radius
of curvature is 10 nm.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Analysis
The self-catalytic
cross-linked COL fibril hydrogels were diluted to a concentration
of 5 mg/mL with 0.1 M acetic acid, and 200 μL was paved on a
clean coverslip. The SEM test sample was obtained by drying naturally,
washing with deionized water repeatedly, fixing with glutaraldehyde,
dehydration with gradient dehydration, critical-point drying, and
other steps.22 After the liquid nitrogen
was fractured and the surface was sprayed with gold, the test samples
was observed in the scanning electron microscope at the acceleration
voltage of 5 kV (Hitachi S3000N, Hitachi, Ltd., Japan).

In Vitro Biocompatibility
Study
According to the international
standard23,24 and the method of Streifel,25 the cytotoxicity of the self-catalytic cross-linked COL
fibril hydrogel was evaluated by the MTT method with L929 as the model
cell, and further the growth and proliferation of cells on the self-catalytic
cross-linked COL fibril hydrogel were observed by confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM)26 and SEM.27

In Vivo Study
The rats with a body
weight of about
300 g were selected. All experimental animals were handled in accordance
with the guidelines formulated by the National Institutes of Health
(China) on human use and care of laboratory animals. The Animal Care
and Use Committee of Sichuan University has approved all procedures
performed for animals. Based on the previous research, a rat model
of wound healing was established.28 Briefly,
Sprague–Dawley rats (average weight: 300 g) were all anesthetized
by intraperitoneal injection of 3% pentobarbital sodium (1 mL/kg).
Then, an area of approximately 1 × 2 cm2 full-thickness
skin excision wounds was artificially created on both sides of the
dorsal surface of the rats (two injuries/rat) under aseptic conditions.
Subsequently, COL-GA group, COL-TGase-0U/g, and COL-TGase-40U/g specimens
were implanted in the right injured side of the rats, and the left
side was regarded as a contralateral control. All the wounds were
wrapped with medical gauze, and an interrupted suture was further
performed. Finally, the animals were euthanized at 1, 2, and 3 weeks
after operation, and the injured and surrounding tissues were taken
and fixed by 10% buffered formalin for histopathological analysis.
The tissue samples were then obtained after dehydration, defatting
and paraffin-embedding, and Masson staining according to our previous
report.29 The appropriate magnification
was selected by an optical microscope to observe wound healing and
new tissue formation.

Results and Discussion
FT-IR Analysis
FT-IR spectroscopy can accurately reflect
the secondary structure of COL and has been reported to be used to
study the characteristic groups and basic skeletons of COL. The triple
helical conformation of COL is particularly important for maintaining
its natural functional characteristics. Figure 1 showed the FT-IR spectra of COL treated
with different concentrations of TGase, and the absorption peaks of
each characteristic amide band of COL could be still clearly identified.
The amide A and B bands of COL appeared at approximately 3326 and
3085 cm–1, respectively, and were the characteristic
absorption peaks of the −OH and −NH2 groups
of the molecular side chain, which were caused by the N–H bond
stretching vibration. The amide I band that appeared at about 1654
cm–1 was mainly associated with the stretching vibration
of the amide group C=O of the COL molecular skeleton, while
the amide II band appearing at 1560 cm–1 was the
absorption peak formed by the bending vibration of the N–H
bond and the telescopic vibration of the C–N bond. In addition,
amide III band at 1240 cm–1 was predominantly attributed
to C–N stretching vibration, N–H bending vibration,
and the wagging vibrations of the CH2 group in the glycine
backbone and proline side chains, which was consistent with observations
previously reported.30−33 As shown in Figure 1, the characteristic absorption peaks of COL after treatment with
different dosages of TGase were obvious, and it was confirmed that
TGase did not destroy the triple helical structure of COL. After the
introduction of TGase, the intensity of the absorption peaks of each
amide band in the IR spectrum was reduced to varying degrees. With
the increasing concentration of TGase, the absorption peaks of amides
A and B exhibited widening and underwent a weak blue shift. This may
have resulted from the generation of intermolecular or intramolecular
covalent cross-linking among COL molecules producing a certain disruption
for the hydrogen bonds between the COL molecules chain and increasing
the order of the molecules, which also suggested that COL had a certain
degree of self-assembly.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of COL cross-linked with different
dosages of TGase
((A) 0 U/g, (B) 10 U/g, (C) 20 U/g, (D) 40 U/g, (E) 60 U/g, (F) 80
U/g).

DSC Analysis
DSC
is commonly used to study the thermal
stability of COL. The thermal denaturation temperature (Td) is defined as the peak value of the corresponding endothermic
process when the triple helical structure of COL is irreversibly damaged.
To some extent, it can also be used to measure the degree of cross-linking
between molecules34−36 and can reflect the integrity of the triple helical
structure of COL. The typical DSC spectrum of COL has a small peak
at about 35 °C, which indicates that the three α-peptide
chains of COL undergo relaxation to a certain extent. With the heating
temperature reaching Td, the triple helical
structure of COL is completely dissociated into three α-peptide
chains, causing many of the excellent properties of COL to disappear
or diminish.37Figure 2 shows the DSC spectrum of COL treated with
different dosages of TGase. As for untreated COL, the Td was found to be 60.6 °C. The causes of this heat
conversion included the interactions of protein and water, the breaking
of hydrogen bonds, and the evaporation and vaporization of combined
water.38 When COL was treated with TGase,
its Td increased to varying degrees from
60.6 to 82.8 °C, indicating that the addition of TGase was conducive
to the improvement of the COL thermal stability.39 This is mainly due to the increased dosage of TGase, the
improved osmosis binding of enzymes to COL, and the formation of more
(γ-glutamyl)-lysine covalent cross-linking bonds of intermolecular
or intramolecular COL molecules.37 Consequently,
the thermostability of COL was increased to a certain extent, which
is significantly beneficial for maintaining its biological activity
and promoting the use of COL biomedical materials.

Figure 2 DSC curves of COL cross-linked
with different dosages of TGase.

CD Analysis
CD can be used to detect specific stereostructures
of α-helix, β-sheet, β-turns, and random coils in
the secondary structure of proteins. It can also be used to characterize
the integrity of COL triple helical structures to some extent. The
typical CD spectra of COL exhibits positive and negative absorption
peaks at 221 and 198 nm, respectively. The ratio of the positive peak
intensity to the negative peak intensity (Rpn) is typically used to
determine the integrity of the COL triple helical structure in dilute
solutions. When its helical structure is destroyed, the positive peak
at 221 nm will disappear in the CD spectrum, and the trough at ∼198
nm will also shift to a lower wavelength.40 The CD spectra of COL treated with different dosages of TGase are
shown in Figure 3.
This spectrum still displayed the typical pattern of natural COL,
indicating that the triple helical structure of COL was still kept
complete after TGase treatment, which is consistent with the findings
of the FT-IR analysis. It is worth noting that the Rpn value of COL
after treatment with TGase was significantly greater than that of
pure COL. This may suggest that the tidiness and orderliness of COL
molecules after treatment with TGase are significantly higher when
compared with pure COL and may also be related to the slight differences
in their secondary structures. Compared with the 80 U/g concentration
of TGase, the Rpn exhibited a greater improvement when the concentration
of TGase was 40 U/g, which may be because the excessive catalytic
cross-linking may have a negative effect on the maintenance of triple
helical structure of collagen. Meanwhile, a higher Rpn value may also
suggest that the formation of the covalent bond induces the self-aggregation
of COL molecules and accelerates the formation of COL fibrils.

Figure 3 CD spectra
of COL cross-linked with different dosages of TGase.

Fibrillogenesis
Figure 4 displays the turbidity versus
time curves of COL treatment
with different dosages of TGase. The increase in TGase concentration
is expected to have an impact on the turbidity of COL at 313 nm. Turbidity
experiments are a common method for studying COL self-assembly in
vitro, which refers to the process of COL fiber formation. The self-assembly
of COL molecules follows the cooperative nucleation–growth
mechanism and is mainly divided into three stages: initial lag period
(the growth phase of nucleation), fiber growth period, and growth
balance period. During the growth phase of nucleation, the absorbance
increases at a slow rate, while the absorbance rapidly increases and
COL accumulates into COL fibrils during the fibril growth period.
Finally, the absorbance reaches the maximum value in the growth balance
period, and the three-dimensional network structure of the COL is
formed at this stage.41 As seen from Figure 4, the nucleation
period of COL after treatment with different concentrations of TGase
was very short, indicating that their nucleation period of fibrillogenesis
process was relatively rapid. The total turbidity change (Δh) and the time reached Δh/2(t1/2) of pure COL were also calculated in the
current study42 and found to be 0.1607
and 3.49 min, respectively. After the introduction of TGase, the total
turbidity increased significantly, and the degree of absorbance was
higher with the growth balance period reached. This proved that the
formation rate of COL fibrils increased and demonstrated that TGase
had a significant promoting effect on the self-aggregation process
of COL. This may be directly related to the fact that TGase catalyzes
the formation of covalent cross-linking of intermolecular or intramolecular
COL molecules.

dosages
of TGase on the fibrillogenesis process of collagen at 313 nm ((A)
0 U/g, (B) 10 U/g, (C) 40 U/g, (D) 80 U/g).

AFM Morphology Analysis
AFM was used to investigate
the effect of TGase on the morphology of COL fibrils. As shown in Figure 5, a large number
of tortuous COL fibrils were tightly arranged and exhibited dense
interfiber tangles. Following the introduction of TGase, the COL fibrils
exhibited a higher degree of entanglement, and the interstices between
fibrils were gradually decreased, which is advantageous for improving
the stability of COL fibrils. In addition, thickening of the fiber
diameter of COL fibrils was observed to a certain degree. Furthermore,
it was shown that TGase catalyzed the self-cross-linking reaction
among COL molecules’ ontology and induced self-aggregation
between COL molecules. At the same time, the D-period cross-striated
structure of COL fibrils could be clearly observed subsequent to the
catalysis of cross-linked COL by different TGase concentrations. These
results proved that the natural structure of COL fibrils can still
be greatly retained after catalytic cross-linking, which plays a major
role in the mechanical and biological functions of COL matrix materials.40

Figure 5 AFM images of collagen cross-linked with different contents
of
TGase ((A) 0 U/g, (B) 10 U/g, (C) 20 U/g, (D) 40 U/g, (E) 60 U/g,
(F) 80 U/g).

SEM Analysis
In
the abovementioned FT-IR, CD, and AFM
analyses, TGase treatment was found to promote the self-aggregation
of COL, while the hydrogen bonds between COL molecule chains also
provided a certain driving force for the self-aggregation of COL.
As shown in Figure 6, the SEM images at different magnifications showed the TGase self-catalytic
cross-linked COL fibrils used at different concentrations (0, 40,
and 80 U/g). COL fibrils treated with different concentrations of
TGase exhibited a typical three-dimensional network structure. COL
fibrils were tightly intertwined, and the arrangement and orientation
of fibrils were disordered and irregular. However, it can be clearly
observed that, with the increase in TGase concentration, the fibers
formed closer tangles and were interspersed with each other, resulting
in a reduction in voids and a more substantial fiber diameter. It
is worth noting that fission occurred in the segmental horizontal
stripes of COL fibrils after cross-linking TGase. This may be due
to the fact that the self-cross-linking could influence the natural
lateral and transverse aggregation of COL simultaneously during the
fibrillogenesis process; therefore, the periodic interval between
D-banding of the fibrils presented expanded and even separated finally.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay
Good cell compatibility
of COL-based materials is a necessary prerequisite for their use as
a medical material.44−46Figure 7 illustrates the optical density values acquired in the MTT assay
for the L929 fibroblast cultured in the leaching liquors after 1,
3, and 5 days. Obviously, the optical density for the L929 fibroblasts
cultured in all the extraction liquids from TGase cross-linked collagen
specimens was significantly higher than that of the negative control,
indicating their nontoxic nature. It is still worth noting that the
optical density of COL-TGase-80U/g is slightly lower than that of
COL-TGase-40U/g in the third and fifth day. Combined with the CD and
fibrillogenesis analysis, 40 U/g may be the optimal concentration
of TGase for the cross-linking of collagen.

on the proliferation of fibroblasts
on the COL fibril hydrogel at different time intervals (1, 3, and
5 days).

Figure 8 displays
CLSM diagrams of fibroblasts co-cultured with the COL fibril hydrogel
for 3 days. After 3 days of culture, the morphology of fibroblasts
on COL-based materials was still normal. Nevertheless, fibroblasts
had a long spindle rather than a circular shape (apoptotic state),
demonstrating that the TGase self-catalytic cross-linked COL was well
compatible. With the increase in TGase concentration, an increasing
trend in the cell density was also observed. According to the CD and
turbidity analyses, the addition of a higher concentration of TGase
led to a higher tendency for the formation of COL regenerated fibers.
Furthermore, it was illustrated that COL regenerated fibers can better
increase the adhesion and proliferation of cells and improve the cell
compatibility of COL-based materials to a certain extent.

Figure 8 CLSM images
of L929 fibroblasts cultured for 3 days on the COL
fibril hydrogel with different contents of TGase treatment (green
is actin, and blue is nuclei; (A) 0 U/g, (B) 40 U/g, (C) 80 U/g).

To further illustrate the compatibility
of the COL fibril hydrogel
with L929 fibroblasts, SEM images were used to observe the cell growth.
As shown in Figure 9, L929 fibroblasts grew well on the specimens, indicating that different
concentrations of the TGase cross-linked COL fibril hydrogel exhibited
excellent compatibility. The number of cells on the COL fibril hydrogels
treated with TGase increased, which may be due to the modified COL
fibril hydrogels providing adhesion sites for L929 fibroblasts, thereby
increasing the cell proliferation rate.43 As a biomass enzyme, the nontoxic behavior of TGase enables cells
that adhere to the COL matrix to survive. Therefore, the catalytic
cross-linked COL material can be applied in biomedicine.

hydrogel with different contents of TGase treatment ((A) 0 U/g, (B)

In Vivo Evaluation
Figure 10 showed the comparison of the effects of
COL-GA, COL-TGase-0U/g, and COL-TGase-40U/g groups on the healing
rate of full-thickness cutaneous wounds. Both COL-TGase-0U/g and COL-TGase-40U/g
could obviously promote wound healing compared with COL-GA. The wound
healing rate in both COL-TGase-0U/g and COL-TGase-40U/g was more than
50% at 2 weeks postoperatively, even the wound healing rate in the
COL-TGase-40U/g group reached ∼75%. At 3 weeks postoperatively,
all the groups were almost completely healed.

Figure 10 The effect of the COL
fibril hydrogel cross-linked by different
TGase dosages on the wound healing rates of the rats.

Figure 11 shows
the histological observation of the wound sections stained with Masson
for 1, 2, and 3 weeks. One week after healing, the wound was enriched
with a large number of fibroblasts, which secrete COL to form COL
fibers in order to fill the wound. As shown in Figure 11a1, b1, a greater number of inflammatory
cells were detected in the COL-GA group as compared with that in the
COL-TGase-0U/g group, while fewer inflammatory cells were observed
in the COL-TGase-40U/g group. After 2 weeks, the epidermal cells at
the edge of the wound were activated, proliferated, and differentiated,
and the epithelial cells of the hair follicle mass in the dermis around
the wound migrated to the wound surface, which accelerates the epithelialization
of the wound. The wounds of COL-TGase-40U/g and COL-TGase-0U/g groups
exhibited complete epithelialization, while small vessels and granulation
tissues also existed. The degree of formation of the COL-TGase-40U/g
group was relatively larger and denser. After 3 weeks, the epithelialization
of the wounds in each group was completed, and the stratum corneum
was formed on the outermost surface. Furthermore, the formation of
the granulation tissue and small blood vessels was observed in each
group, with the highest formation degree observed in the COL-TGase-40U/g
group. It is worth noting that the hair root was formed in the COL-TGase-40U/g
group, indicating that the wound surface had healed completely. Finally,
the results also revealed that the COL-TGase-40U/g group had a significant
effect on wound healing.

Conclusions
Herein,
the nontoxic glutamine transaminase (TGase) with high specific
activity was used for the self-catalytic cross-linking of the regenerated
collagen (COL) fibril hydrogel fabricated through a molecular self-assembly
method. The results indicated that TGase can catalyze the covalent
cross-linking among the intermolecular or intramolecular COL and promote
the self-aggregation of COL to assemble into aligned collagen fibrils,
mimicking the structure and biofunctionality of biological tissues
from the nanoscopic to macroscopic length scales. After introducing
TGase, the triple helical structure of natural COL is still remained,
and its thermal stability is greatly improved, which plays an important
role in maintaining the biological function of the collagen matrix
material. Furthermore, the resulting COL fibril hydrogel can significantly
increase cell adhesion and proliferation. In addition, the COL fibril
hydrogel could meaningfully promote skin wound healing, and its capacity
of skin tissue for regeneration was better than the COL hydrogel as
expected. Therefore, the COL fibril hydrogel self-catalytic cross-linked
by TGase is expected to be a novel soft material for wound healing.
