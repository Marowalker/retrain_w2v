The first set of phenoxy BsubNc compounds,
PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc,
was synthesized through an axial displacement reaction of Cl-ClnBsubNc with phenol and pentafluorophenol
(respectively). Like their precursor, the products were found to be
an alloyed mixture of phenoxylated ClnBsubNcs with random positioning in the solid state yet consistent
frequency of bay position chlorination. The average bay position chlorine
occupancy was determined to be 0.99 through single crystal diffraction
of PhO-ClnBsubNc. Although the phenoxylation
of Cl-ClnBsubNc did not influence the
chromophore photophysical properties, the electrochemical behavior
was found to be more stable. Phenoxylation yielded differences in
organic photovoltaic (OPV) device metrics. Specifically, a significant
increase in open circuit voltage (VOC)
was observed, ultimately exceeding 1.0 V when phenoxylated ClnBsubNcs were paired with alpha-sexithiophene
(α-6T) in planar heterojunction OPVs. Phenoxylation enabled
the first example of BsubNcs incorporated into polymer-based bulk
heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs through enhanced solubility. Phenoxylated
ClnBsubNcs, when paired with poly-3-hexylthiophene,
also showed high VOC in BHJ OPVs with
broad spectral absorption up to 760 nm. In the BHJ case, simple phenoxy
was shown to be a better axial substituent compared to pentafluorophenoxy.
This study represents the first example of using ClnBsubNcs with nonchlorine axial substituents in OPVs and demonstrates
that phenoxylation has a significant impact on device metrics while
enhancing solubility to enable incorporation of ClnBsubNcs into BHJ OPVs.

Introduction
Boron subnaphthalocyanines
(BsubNcs) are lower homologues of naphthalocyanines
composed of three N-fused 1,3-diiminobenzoisoindoline subunits around
a single, central boron atom (Figure 1a). They are formed from a cyclotrimerization reaction
of 2,3-dicyanonaphthalene with a Lewis acidic boron template (e.g.
PhBCl2, BBr3, BCl3) in an aromatic
solvent or solvent mixtures under an inert atmosphere (Scheme 1). Like boron subphthalocyanines
(BsubPcs), which are instead composed of 1,3-diiminoisoindoline subunits,
BsubNcs are nonplanar, cone-shaped, and aromatic in structure.1−6 Compared to BsubPcs, BsubNcs have a longer π-conjugation system,
causing their absorption spectra to be heavily red-shifted; the Q
band is found in the mid and high 600 nm region in solution2−6 and in thin solid films,7 respectively.
This feature of capturing light in the red portion of the visible
spectrum, combined with their high molar extinction coefficients,
has made them desirable targets as a photosensitizing agent in photodynamic
therapy.5 Additionally, and more relevant
to our research group, Cl-BsubNc (Figure 1) has seen increasing interest as a photo-
and electro-active material in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) since
its debut in 2009.7−9 No other BsubNc derivative has been explored in this
application. At the present time, there are several reports on the
use of Cl-BsubNc in OPVs.7−16 In one of these studies, its inclusion resulted in an 8.4% efficient
planar heterojunction (PHJ) OPV cell, a power conversion efficiency
(PCE) value that is one of the highest within the space of PHJ OPVs.14

In our previous work, we had demonstrated
that Cl-BsubNc, whether
synthesized via literature methods or our in-house developed processes
or purchased from a commercial vendor, is actually a mixture of Cl-BsubNc
products with random amounts of chlorination at the bay positions
of the BsubNc structure. As a result of this mixture and chlorination
format, we appropriately refer to the compound as chloro-(chloro)n-boron subnaphthalocyanine (Cl-ClnBsubNc, Figure 1a).16 The conclusion of
our study was consistent with the study of Endres et al.,17 published at approximately the same time. We
were unable to develop a chemical process to produce a pure, nonperipherally
chlorinated sample of Cl-BsubNc. However, we were able to develop
chemical processes to produce Cl-ClnBsubNcs
with either lower or higher amounts of peripheral chlorination relative
to the literature or commercial Cl-ClnBsubNc samples. The bay position chlorination and its quantification
were determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Following these structural analyses,
we showed that the photo- and electrophysical properties as well as
the PHJ OPV device characteristics were found to be different among
the Cl-ClnBsubNc samples with varying
amounts of chlorination. Our findings strongly suggest that the Cl-BsubNc
samples used in all previous reported OPV studies are likely not pure,
consisting of a mixture of Cl-ClnBsubNcs
with bay position chlorination.16

Within the literature, there are only six derivatives beyond Cl-BsubNc.
Three of these compounds are derived from using substituted 2,3-dicyanonaphthalene,1,2,6 one compound is derived from using
BBr3 as the Lewis acid and templating agent,3 and two compounds are derived from an axial displacement
reaction.6 Despite the limited examples,
the BsubNc scaffold is derivatizable at the axial position and the
periphery much like their BsubPc counterparts. This chemical flexibility
has proven to be a powerful tool for tailoring the physicochemical
properties of BsubPcs18,19 such as their solubilities,20 optical absorption properties,21,22 solid-state arrangements,23,24 and electrochemical
properties.25,26 From the collection of known
BsubNcs, albeit small in quantity, it appears that the BsubNcs also
share this tunability feature. For example, peripheral fluorination
blue-shifts the absorption spectra and lowers the HOMO energy level
of the resulting BsubNc compound relative to Cl-BsubNc.6

As mentioned above, a pure, nonperipherally
chlorinated Cl-BsubNc
cannot be obtained but its mixture of chlorinated species collectively
shows great promise as a light-harvesting and charge-transporting
material in OPVs.16 Given this performance
appeal and the fact that no other BsubNc outside of Cl-BsubNc/Cl-ClnBsubNc has been studied in OPVs, we were
motivated to examine other derivatives of this class. In particular,
we were interested in adopting axial phenoxylation chemistry because
of our familiarity and our established protocols for introducing phenoxy
substituents at the axial position(s) of BsubPcs20,27,28 and silicon phthalocyanines (SiPcs).29,30 We have shown that displacing the axial halide with a phenoxy group(s)
leads to improvements or benefits on several different levels: (1)
open-circuit voltage (VOC) output stemming
from a better solid-state arrangement for Pcs,29,30 (2) charge transport properties for BsubPcs,31 (3) solubility in organic solvents for BsubPcs20,32 and Pcs,33 and (4) ambipolar (i.e. n-
and p-type) characteristics for BsubPcs28 and SiPcs.29,30

Herein, we first describe
the synthesis of two phenoxylated derivatives
of BsubNc, phenoxy-BsubNc (PhO-ClnBsubNc)
and pentafluorophenoxy-BsubNc (F5-ClnBsubNc), from an axial displacement reaction of Cl-ClnBsubNc obtained from our in-house “literature
procedure”.16 Reacting this mixed
intermediate with a phenol derivative also resulted in a product composed
of an alloyed mixture, where the random bay position chlorination
was again confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The synthesis and confirmation
of composition is followed by an examination of the phenoxy-ClnBsubNc’s basic photo- and electrophysical
properties and their PHJ OPV and bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OPV device
characteristics. Comparison of these properties is then made to those
of Cl-ClnBsubNc. We also outline how phenoxylation
enables the application of these derivatives in solution processed
polymer-based BHJ OPVs. Again, we emphasize that this work not only
augments the very small collection of known BsubNc derivatives but
it marks the first set of examples of BsubNcs other than the prototypical
Cl-BsubNc as the organic photoactive material in OPVs.

Results and Discussion
From our previous work, a number of processes were developed for
the synthesis of Cl-ClnBsubNc. Each distinct
route resulted in a mixture of Cl-ClnBsubNc
products that differed among each other in the level of bay position
chlorination.16 The best route with respect
to mass yield was the one adapted using the literature process published
by Kennedy et al.4,16 The resulting product, which
we had termed “literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc”, was found to be composed of Cl-BsubNc, Cl-Cl1BsubNc, Cl-Cl2BsubNc, and Cl-Cl3BsubNc.
Through the same axial phenoxylation chemistry that has been developed
for BsubPcs,23,27 literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc was treated with phenol and pentafluorophenol
in refluxing toluene solution to produce PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc,
respectively (Scheme 1). High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)−UV/vis analysis
revealed a mixture of five BsubNc compounds, based on the absorption
profile characteristic of a BsubNc chromophore, with Rt ≈ 3.4, 3.9, 4.6, 5.4, and 5.6 min and Rt ≈ 4.1, 4.8, 5.6, 6.6, and 6.9 min for
PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc, respectively (Figures S1 and S2). The quantity of the five products in both
samples matches those of literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc (Rt ≈ 3.6, 4.4, 5.4, 6.9,
and 7.1 min).16

Following their synthesis,
the phenoxy-ClnBsubNcs were purified via
train sublimation. Like our previous
findings on the processes leading to any of the Cl-ClnBsubNcs,16 the technique
was not successful in separating any of the BsubNc compounds. This
inability was not a concern given that mixtures of Cl-ClnBsubNcs perform well in PHJ OPVs.16 The sublimed sample of each phenoxy-ClnBsubNc was suitable for analysis by low-resolution mass spectroscopy
(LRMS); LRMS analysis of PhO-ClnBsubNc
and F5-ClnBsubNc is consistent
of a mixture of four compounds/isomers (Figure S3): PhO-BsubNc (m/z 638.2),
PhO-Cl1BsubNc (m/z 672.2),
PhO-Cl2BsubNc (m/z 706.1),
and PhO-Cl3BsubNc (m/z 740.1) and a mixture of three compounds/isomers (Figure S4), F5-BsubNc (m/z 728.2), F5-Cl1BsubNc (m/z 762.1), and F5-Cl2BsubNc
(m/z 796.1). It is worth noting
two observations. The first is that the F5-ClnBsubNc sample has one fewer peripherally chlorinated
species (3 vs 4) compared to the PhO-ClnBsubNc sample. Second, the number of compounds as detected by LRMS
(i.e. 3/4) is lower than that by HPLC (i.e. 5). This is consistent
with the previous findings for literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc and for a commercial sample.16 We attribute this difference to a structural isomeric effect, whereby
a pair of structural isomers may have different Rts on HPLC. It is also possible, in the case of F5-ClnBsubNc, that this difference
could be attributed to the relative sensitivity of the LRMS instrument,
whereby the intensity of a fourth and fifth BsubNc species is below
the detection limit. To the best of our knowledge, these two BsubNc
compounds are the first set of phenoxy BsubNc derivatives, and this
is the second known example of the use of axial functionalization
of BsubNc. In contrast to this, there are several known phenoxy derivatives
of BsubPcs.21,23,27,34,35

For
PhO-ClnBsubNc, crystals suitable
for X-ray diffraction were grown by slow evaporation from a DCM solution
(Figures 2, S5, and Tables S1–S7, CCDC deposition 1588061). The crystal analysis confirmed a mixture
of chlorinated species and that phenoxylation was exclusive to the
axial position. Like the literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc’s X-ray-determined structure,16 the chlorines were found situated exclusively in the bay position.
The average peripheral chlorine occupancy was calculated to be 0.99
per molecule (Table S7), resulting in an
average molecular formula of C42H22.01BCl0.99N6O. This value is slightly lower than that
found for literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc (1.13).16

1H NMR analysis was carried out on the doubly
sublimed
samples of PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc (Figures S6 and S7). The 1H NMR spectra are very similar
in regards to the chemical shift range and multiplicity to their precursor,
Cl-ClnBsubNc. Three sets of peaks were
observed in the aromatic region and are attributed to the BsubNc macrocyclic
ring. For PhO-ClnBsubNc, three additional
peaks were found upfield in the aromatic region, corresponding to
the axial phenoxy substituent. As reported previously by our group16 and by Endres et al.17 assignment of the resonances as well as quantification are problematic
due to the mixture format of each synthesized sample. The bay position 1H resonance peaks were found downfield in the range of 9.45–9.25
ppm, which is in line with the findings by Takao and Ohno.6 In the study of Takao and Ohno, all peripheral
positions other than the bay position of the BsubNc structure were
fluorinated, allowing for the 1H NMR characterization of
the bay position hydrogens. Additionally, Takagi and Mizutani were
able to characterize the bay position resonances in a recent study
due to the lack of bay position chlorination.36 However, unlike these findings, the multiplicity of the bay position
hydrogens for PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc was found to be multiplets
as opposed to singlets. The multiplet patterns are caused by the presence
of the asymmetric randomly bay-chlorinated BsubNc isomers, as opposed
to a single compound. As a result of this mixture format, it is very
problematic to assign and quantify the bay-position 1H
resonances of PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc. Therefore, 1H NMR analysis cannot easily quantify the level of bay position chlorines
for either compound. A more comprehensive NMR investigation has been
stated to be underway by Endres et al.17

UV–vis absorption spectra of the two phenoxy ClnBsubNcs were acquired in toluene solutions
at room
temperature (Figure 3a and Table S8). Both compounds had nearly
identical profiles to each that are characteristic of a BsubNc chromophore.
The main Q band for PhO-ClnBsubNc and
F5-ClnBsubNc were found at
a λmax of 650 and 654 nm with a distinct shoulder
peak at 587 and 591 nm, respectively. In comparison to literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc,16 the
phenoxy derivatives are slightly blue-shifted (i.e. to higher energy)
in absorption with slightly higher extinction coefficients.

The PL spectra (λex = 630 nm) of
the two phenoxy
ClnBsubNc compounds were also acquired
in toluene solutions at room temperature (Figure 3b and Table S8). Like the results from the absorption experiments, the PL spectra
of PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc were very similar with λmax of emission at 662 and 666 nm, respectively. While the
latter spectrum is essentially identical to that of the literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc,16 the
former spectrum is slightly blue-shifted. With similarities in absorption
and PL to literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc, it
is not surprising that their Stokes shifts are also nearly identical.
In contrast to their phenoxy BsubPc counterparts,27 these Stokes shifts are noticeably smaller (12 nm vs 20–29
nm). This suggests that their ground state and excited state are closer
in structure than those of the phenoxy BsubPcs, a feature that is
likely traced back to the more rigid nature of the benzoisoindoline
subunits. Fluorescence quantum yields (ΦPL) of 19%
were calculated relative to a standard of oxazine-170 (Table S8 and eq S1), and they were somewhat lower than the value for literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc.

The electrochemical properties
of PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc
were analyzed via cyclic voltammetry (CV) in degassed DCM solution
containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Figure 4 and Table S8). All potentials (E) were corrected to
the half-wave reduction potential (E1/2,red) of decamethylferrocene (−0.012 V vs Ag/AgCl37). Each compound underwent a reversible first oxidation
(Eox1), an irreversible second oxidation (Eox2), and a reversible
reduction (Ered1). Amongst the two, PhO-ClnBsubNc is easier to oxidize (Eox1 = 0.80 vs 0.85
V) while F5-ClnBsubNc is easier
to reduce (Ered1 = −0.94 vs −0.99 V). The same
trend is also observed for the related BsubPcs, whereby PhO-BsubPc38 is easier to oxidize, whereas F5-BsubPc27,39 is easier to reduce. It is desirable to note that both Eox1 and Ered1 were reversible processes, a feature that is absent for Cl-ClnBsubNc16 and one
that is not common for BsubPcs.21 On the
basis of this, adding a phenol substituent in the axial position of
BsubNc grants the molecule electrochemical reversibility in the reduction
regime. This effect is also true for some phenoxylated BsubPcs.27,39 The reversibility in both the oxidation and reduction region for
the phenoxy ClnBsubNcs is not overly surprising
as the aromatic nature of the axial substituent combined with the
more π-extended benzoisoindoline subunits are anticipated to
stabilize the BsubNc in its radical anion or radical cation form.
Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV, degassed DMF, 0.1 M TBAPC) was
also carried out and it verified the CV results (Figure S8 and Table S9).

Given the similar photophysical
properties to literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc
and the reversible electrochemical
nature of phenoxy ClnBsubNcs, the performance
of PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc were first examined as electron acceptors
within PHJ OPV devices. Each compound was paired with sexithiophene
(α-6T) using the following device structure: indium tin oxide
(ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/α-6T
(50 nm)/ClnBsubNc (25 nm)/bathocuprione
(BCP, 10 nm)/silver (Ag, 80 nm). This configuration replicates the
one adopted for the Cl-ClnBsubNc-based
PHJ OPV cells in our previous study,16 allowing
for a direct point of comparison. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Figure 5a) were measured under 100
mW/cm2 of simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination. The measured
external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Figure 5b. The performance characteristics
(Table 1) are derived
from the measurement of at least 16 PHJ OPV devices.

PHJ OPV cells made with PhO-ClnBsubNc
outperform the cells made with F5-ClnBsubNc across the board (i.e. VOC, JSC, FF), producing an average PCE
of 1.87% for the former and 1.57% for the latter. The VOCs are higher than those based on literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc and are consistent with a steric shielding
effect,40 observed with sterically bulky
groups (i.e. phenoxy groups) in small molecule-41−43 and polymer44-based OPVs. This effect is explained by an increase
in the distance between the donor and acceptor materials induced by
steric hindrance. This causes the potential energy of electron–hole
pairs at the donor–acceptor interface to increase, leading
to an enhancement in the VOC.40

Although these cells had higher VOCs than those based on literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc, their PCEs were more than two times
lower. The major loss
for both set of devices was the result of much lower extracted JSCs. Given that the photophysical properties
of the phenoxy ClnBsubNcs are similar
to literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc, it is unlikely
that the origin of this loss is derived from the efficiency behind
the photon absorption and exciton generation process. It is more likely
that the lower JSCs are attributed to
a decrease in the efficiency behind the exciton dissociation step,
whereby the barrier for electron transfer from the α-6T to the
BsubNc layer is higher as evident in the higher reduction potentials
(i.e. weaker electron accepting ability). Moreover, the drop in the JSCs could be the result of a steric shielding
effect (as described above) due to the higher potential energy of
electron–hole pairs at the donor–acceptor interface,
making it more difficult to separate and collect the individual charge
carriers.40 Overall, these results imply
that contrary to BsubPcs,28 adding phenoxy
groups at the axial position of ClnBsubNc
mixtures is detrimental to PHJ OPV device performance. These results
also imply that there could be a better electron-donating material
than α-6T for pairing with the phenoxy ClnBsubNcs, a point of future work.

Having demonstrated
the functionality of Cl-ClnBsubNc, PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc as electron acceptors
paired with α-6T and having noted the increase in solubility
of the phenoxylated ClnBsubNcs, we then
moved to explore their potential application in BHJ solution processed
OPVs. For simple proof of functionality, we chose the benchmark polymer
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), the relatively simple thiophene homo-polymer,
somewhat analogous to α-6T and one of the most extensively used
and best understood polymers in OPV research.45,46 See ESI for experimental device fabrication details. We started
with a mass ratio of P3HT/ClnBsubNc of
1.0:0.8, again to simply illustrate the functionality.

Initial
indication was that Cl-ClnBsubNc
could be solubilized in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB)
along with P3HT at 45 °C overnight. However, on casting of the
solution, distinct crystals of Cl-ClnBsubNc
formed within the film (Figure S9). However,
we still used AFM to characterize the morphology of the three distinct
thin films of photoactive layer composite (Figure S10). In the case of Cl-ClnBsubNc,
AFM was conducted away from the crystal formation. The surface roughness RRMS is 6.04 nm for the surface of films derived from Cl-ClnBsubNc and 6.07 nm for F5PhO-ClnBsubNc. The highest RMS was found for the
mixtures incorporating PhO-ClnBsubNc (9.36
nm). A rougher metal–polymer interface can be desirable, to
a point, for efficient charge collection through a larger net surface
area.47

The BHJ OPV device metrics
incorporating the three ClnBsubNcs (under
100 mW·cm–2 of simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination)
are outlined in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 6. All ClnBsubNcs are shown to
be functional in BHJ OPVs. OPVs
incorporating PhO-ClnBsubNc gave the best
PCE (0.70%) compared to those fabricated with Cl-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc,
which is consistent with the higher surface roughness mentioned above
and the absence of large crystal formation. The higher PCEs of the
PhO-ClnBsubNc BHJ OPVs are attributed
to a higher VOC and JSC. The high VOC is of interest
and expected relative to standard fullerene-based acceptors based
on the established band structure (Figure 1). Also of interest is the significant coverage
of the visible spectrum as indicated in the EQE. Typical power conversion
stops at approximately 650 nm for P3HT/fullerene-based BHJ OPVs. The
absorption profile of the ClnBsubNc acceptors,
however, enables power conversion up to approximately 760 nm.

To scope the potential for optimization of ClnBsubNc-based BHJ OPVs, we explored the standard
set of device
optimization handles, starting with the use of volatile additives.48 The concentration of volatile additives that
have been reported are typically low, often in the range of 1–3%
by volume relative to the host solvent. We added 0.5 and 1% (by volume)
1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) into the principal solvent of ODCB to prepare
films of P3HT/ClnBsubNc, and we observed
a change in BHJ OPV metrics, depending on the ClnBsubNc acceptor (Table 3).

For devices based on Cl-ClnBsubNc,
the PCEs of devices prepared with 1-CN as an additive were reduced
based on both a reduction in the VOC and JSC. It is not assumed 1-CN as an additive will
always be beneficial.46,49 The presence of 1-CN in blend
of P3HT/Cl-ClnBsubNc presumably led to
the formation of a film with a nonoptimal morphology. For P3HT/F5-ClnBsubNc devices, we obtained
a higher PCE (0.74%) for OPVs fabricated from mixtures of 0.5% of
1-CN in ODCB than for OPVs made from ODCB alone (0.38%). The PCE of
the devices slightly decreased when adding a higher amount of 1-CN
(1%). In OPVs composed of P3HT/PhO-ClnBsubNc, the use of 1-CN proved to yield higher efficiency and ultimately
the best PCE, which is consistent with baseline PCE results. The use
of 0.5% 1-CN enhanced the PCE from 0.7 to 1.07%. A similar, slight
decrease in performance was observed when a larger amount of 1-CN
(1%) was used. We then also examined the influence of 1,8-diiodooctane
(DIO) on the metrics of OPVs prepared exclusively with P3HT/PhO-ClnBsubNc blend. In the presence of DIO (3%),
metrics dropped significantly (VOC = 0.55
± 0.046 V; JSC = 0.06 ± 0.01
mA/cm2; FF = 0.320 ± 0.012; and PCE 0.011 ± 0.002%).
The addition of DIO also yielded a significant color change of the
casted films (Figure S11). Color changes
with BsubNcs are easily attributed to the changes in solid-state arrangements;
arrangement perhaps enabled by DIO halogen bonding to the imine nitrogen
of the BsubNc chromophore.24 These results
clearly indicate that DIO is not suitable for enhancing device metrics
for PhO-ClnBsubNc.

We then moved
on to scope the effect of thermal annealing on BHJ
OPVs based on P3HT/PhO-ClnBsubNc. Thermal
annealing has been proven effective for the increase in performance
of BHJ OPVs based on P3HT.46 For devices
composed of P3HT and small molecule electron acceptors, higher performance
was often obtained when annealed below 150 °C.50−53 Therefore, P3HT/PhO-ClnBsubNc devices were annealed for 15 min at temperatures
varying between 110 and 150 °C performed before the deposition
of BCP and Ag, so-called prethermal treatment. ODCB was used as a
solvent, and no volatile additive was used. The effect of thermal
annealing on the device performance is showed in Figure 7, including J–V and EQE plots. The experimental data are
summarized in Table 4.

Figure 7 shows the
dependence of thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance of
BHJ OPVs containing P3HT/PhO-ClnBsubNc
active layer. After annealing at 110 °C for 15 min, the efficiency
of devices was slightly increased from 0.70 to 0.89%. The improvement
in the PCE of devices annealed at 110 °C was due to an enhanced JSC from 2.05 to 2.53 mA/cm2, consistent
with the increase in EQE within the range of 300–750 nm. Annealing
at higher temperature (130 and 150 °C) led to a decrease in efficiency
relative to 110 °C due to a decrease in JSC and (minor) change in VOC. Therefore,
annealing at 110 °C for 15 min was used moving forward.

The final handle we probed was the mass ratio between the electron-accepting
PhO-ClnBsubNc and the electron-donating
P3HT. All the devices were preannealed at 110 °C for 15 min.
We did obtain a PCE of 1% for devices at a 1.0:1.0 ratio of P3HT/PhO-ClnBsubNc. This was achieved through a modest
increase in JSC while maintaining the VOC and FF parameters (Figure 8 and Table 5).

Conclusions
The first set of phenoxy BsubNc compounds—PhO-ClnBsubNc and F5-ClnBsubNc—was synthesized through an axial displacement
reaction of literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc with
phenol and pentafluorophenol (respectively). Like their precursor
Cl-ClnBsubNc, the phenoxylated products
were composed of an alloyed mixture of phenoxylated ClnBsubNcs with differing levels of bay position chlorination
which could not be separated. Single crystals of PhO-ClnBsubNc were obtained, analyzed, and determined to
have an average bay position chlorine occupancy of 0.99. While the
phenoxy ClnBsubNcs share photophysical
characteristics similar to literature-Cl-ClnBsubNc, their electrochemical properties were found to be modified
by phenoxylation; they display reversible oxidative and reductive
processes with the reduction potential being significantly higher
when compared against Cl-ClnBsubNc. Phenoxylation
also resulted in a significant change in the application of ClnBsubNc in OPVs. Within PHJ OPVs, phenoxylation
resulted in a significant performance drop compared to Cl-ClnBsubNc. However, the inclusion of the phenoxy molecular
fragment resulted in PHJ OPVs with higher open-circuit voltages (VOC), suggesting that a steric shielding effect
between the donor and acceptor is likely in play and that higher efficiencies
could be afforded with a better electron-donating material than alpha-sexithiophene
(α-6T) for pairing with the phenoxy ClnBsubNcs. This very high VOC also
translated into BHJ OPVs. The solubility of ClnBsubNc was significantly enhanced by phenoxylation, enabling
incorporation into BHJ OPVs. Several of the standard handles for potentially
optimizing BHJ OPVs also enabled increased BHJ OPV device performance.
In conclusion, the work herein marks the first examples of the use
of BsubNcs with a non-chlorine axial substituent in OPVs. Contrary
to BsubPcs, the axial derivatization of ClnBsubNcs seems to have a pronounced effect on the electrochemical
properties and PHJ OPV performance. More work is ongoing to deconvolute
these observations to determine if other electron-donating materials
would work better when paired with phenoxy ClnBsubNcs and ultimately the best pairing to truly see the ultimate
potential of BsubNcs as electron-accepting materials.

Methods
All reactions were performed
under an atmosphere
of an inert gas using oven-dried glassware. Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer at
23 °C in CDCl3, operating at 400 MHz for 1H NMR. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million
referenced to tetramethylsilane (0 ppm) for 1H NMR. Coupling
constants (J) are reported in hertz. Spin multiplicities
are designated by the following abbreviations: s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). LRMS was
carried out on a GCT Premier TOF mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation,
Milford, Massachusetts, USA) with EI/CI sources. Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra were acquired on a PerkinElmer
Lambda 1050 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer using a PerkinElmer quartz cuvette
with a 10 mm path length. PL spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer
LS55 fluorescence spectrometer using a PerkinElmer quartz cuvette
with a 10 mm path length. HPLC analysis was carried out on a Waters
2695 separation module with a Waters 2998 photodiode array and a SunFire
C18 3.5 μm 3.0 × 150 mm column. The mobile phase used was
HPLC grade acetonitrile (80% by volume) and N,N-dimethylformamide (20% by volume). Cyclic and DPV was
carried out using a Bioanalytical Systems C3 electrochemical workstation.
The working electrode was a 1 mm platinum disk, the counter electrode
was a platinum wire, and the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl2 saturated salt solution. Spec-grade solvents were purged with a
nitrogen gas at room temperature prior to their use. Four cycles at
a scan rate of 100 mV/s were measured for each sample. Tetrabutylammonium
perchlorate (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. Decamethylferrocene
was used as an internal reference. All half-wave potentials were corrected
to the half-wave reduction potential (E1/2,red) of decamethylferrocene, which was previously reported to be −0.012
V vs Ag/AgCl.37

PHJ OPV Device Fabrication
OPV devices were fabricated
on 25 mm by 25 mm glass substrates coated with ITO having a sheet
resistance of 15 Ω per square. The ITO was prepatterned, leaving
8 mm from one side as uncoated glass. Substrates were cleaned by successive
sonications in detergent and solvents, followed by 5 min of atmospheric
plasma treatment. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the substrates, 500
rpm, 10 s and 4000 rpm, 30 s. Substrates were baked on a hot plate
at 110 °C for 10 min and then transferred into a nitrogen atmosphere
glovebox (O2 < 10 ppm, H2O < 10 ppm).
All subsequent device layers were thermally evaporated at ∼1.0
A/s and a working pressure of ∼1 × 10–7 Torr for organic layers and ∼1 × 10–6 Torr for Ag. The α-6T layer thickness for all devices was
50 nm. All BsubNc layer thicknesses were 25 nm, followed by a 10 nm
layer of BCP. Silver electrodes were evaporated to a thickness of
80 nm through a shadow mask, defining 0.2 cm2 as the active
area for each device. A transfer back to the glovebox was required
between BCP and silver layers to change the shadow masks.

PHJ OPV Device
Characterization
Layer thickness and
deposition rates of evaporated films were monitored using a quartz
crystal microbalance calibrated against films deposited on glass and
measured with a KLA-Tencor P16+ surface profilometer. To enhance the
electrical contact during testing, silver paint was applied to the
ITO and metal electrode contact points and left to dry for 20 min.
Devices were kept in the nitrogen-filled glovebox throughout testing.
Voltage sweeps of the devices were performed under full illumination
by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Oriel) with an AM 1.5G filter, and the corresponding
currents were measured with a Keithley 2401 Low Voltage SourceMeter.
Light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW/cm2 with reference
to a calibrated silicon photodetector. Wavelengths scans at 10 nm
intervals were performed using an in-line Cornerstone 260 1/4 m Monochromator,
and the corresponding currents were measured using a Newport Optical
Power Meter 2936-R and converted to external quantum efficiencies
using a reference wavelength scan of a calibrated silicon photodetector.

BHJ OPV Device Fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates
were cleaned with water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic
bath. The dried subtrates were subjected to air plasma treatment for
5 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios Al4083) was spin-casted on the cleaned ITO
subtracted for 4000 rpm for 30 s. The resulting layers were annealed
in air at 115 °C for 30 min. All the subsequent steps were performed
in a controlled atmosphere in a glovebox. P3HT is first solubilized
in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) to form a 10 mg/mL solution. The solution
was heated at 45 °C for 2 h. The P3HT solution was then added
to ClnBsubNc. The ratio of donor to acceptor
was initially chosen to be 1.0:0.8. The resulting solutions were heated
at 45 °C overnight. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating
the photoactive blend onto the PEDOT:PSS at 1000 rpm for 2 min. It
should be noted that the solution was kept at 45 °C during the
spin-coating process. Also, all substrates of ITO/PEDOT:PSS were spun
while dropping the photoactive solution. A thin layer of BCP was deposited
on the top of the active layer as the buffer layer (7 nm). The cells
were completed by evaporating 80 nm of Ag as the top electrode. The
vacuum chamber had a base pressure of ∼8 × 10–8 Torr and a working pressure ∼1 × 10–7 Torr during deposition of BCP and Ag. The resulting photocells had
the following architecture: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/ClnBsubNc/BCP/Ag.

Synthetic Procedures
2,3-Dicyanonaphthalene
2,3-Dicyanonaphthalene (DCNAP)
was prepared according to literature procedure.54

Chloro Boron Subnaphthalocyanine (Cl-ClnBsubNc)
To a three-neck round bottom flask equipped
with a gas inlet and a short-path condenser was added DCNAP (3.80
g, 0.021 mol, 1 equiv) and dried 1,2-dichlorobenzene (80 mL) under
an atmosphere of argon gas. The mixture was stirred for 10 min at
room temperature before BCl3 (1.0 M in heptane, 22.5 mL,
1.1 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 150 °C
for 1 h to distill off the heptane before it was heated to 180 °C
for 2 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and concentrated
via rotary evaporation. The crude product (0.730 g) was purified by
train sublimation. The apparatus was operated under a vacuum with
a controlled flow of carbon dioxide gas generating an internal pressure
of 100 mTorr. The temperature was increased from room temperature
to ∼580 °C (external temperature) and was held constant
at that temperature overnight. A metallic purple band was collected
(0.150 g, 21% yield relative to mass placed in the train sublimation
apparatus). The sublimed product was subsequently purified a second
time by train sublimation under the same condition (0.115 g, 76% yield
relative to the mass placed in the train sublimation apparatus). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 9.43 (s, 6H), 8.37–8.33
(m, 6H), 7.77–7.73 (m, 6H); MS (EI): m/z 580.1, 614.1, 648.1, 684.0; UV–vistoluene λmax(ε): 656 nm (78 400 M–1 cm–1).

Phenoxy Boron Subnaphthalocyanine
(PhO-ClnBsubNc)
To an oven-dried
round bottom flask equipped
with a condenser and a gas inlet was added Cl-ClnBsubNc (0.41 g, 0.71 mmol, 1 equiv), phenol (0.33 g, 3.51 mmol,
5 equiv), and toluene (35 mL) under an atmosphere of argon gas. The
reaction mixture was heated to a reflux (∼115 °C), and
the reaction progress was monitored via HPLC. After ∼16 h,
the reaction was cooled to room temperature and the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure to yield a dark purple solid (0.48 g). The
crude product was purified twice by train sublimation. The apparatus
was operated under a vacuum with a controlled flow of carbon dioxide
gas generating an internal pressure of 100 mTorr. The temperature
was increased from room temperature to ∼560 °C (external
temperature) and was held constant at that temperature overnight.
A metallic purple band was collected (126 mg, 28%). Single crystals
suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were grown by slow evaporation
from DCM solution. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3):
δ 9.40–9.25 (m, 6H), 8.35–8.22 (m, 6H), 7.72–7.61
(m, 6H), 6.83–6.74 (m, 2H), 6.69–6.61 (m, 1 H), 5.64–5.55
(m, 2H); MS (EI): m/z 638.2, 672.2,
706.1, 740.1; UV–vistoluene λmax(ε): 650 nm (90 000 M–1 cm–1).

Pentafluorophenoxy Boron Subnaphthalocyanine (F5-ClnBsubNc)
To an oven-dried round bottom
flask equipped with a condenser and a gas inlet was added Cl-ClnBsubNc (0.33 g, 0.57 mmol, 1 equiv), pentafluorophenol
(0.52 g, 2.84 mmol, 5 equiv), and toluene (30 mL) under an atmosphere
of argon gas. The reaction mixture was heated to a reflux (∼115
°C), and the reaction progress was monitored via HPLC. After
∼16 h, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield a dark purple
solid (0.43 g). The crude product was purified twice by train sublimation.
The apparatus was operated under a vacuum with a controlled flow of
carbon dioxide gas generating an internal pressure of 100 mTorr. The
temperature was increased from room temperature to ∼560 °C
(external temperature) and was held constant at that temperature overnight.
A metallic purple band was collected (0.13 g, 31%). 1H
NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 9.45–9.34 (m, 6H),
8.39–3.20 (m, 6H), 7.81–7.70 (m, 6H); MS (EI): m/z 728.2, 762.1, 796.1; UV–vistoluene λmax(ε): 654 nm (86 000
M–1 cm–1).
