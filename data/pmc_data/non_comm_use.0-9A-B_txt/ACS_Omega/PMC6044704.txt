Because circulating microRNAs (miRNAs)
have been recognized as
a new class of blood-based biomarkers for various diseases, a significant
challenge has been the development of point-of-care testing (POCT)
systems based on detection of circulating miRNAs directly from serum.
A promising approach to POCT systems is considered to be the development
of enzyme-free and isothermal detection systems. Here, two types of
DNA circuit system based on proportional and exponential amplification
strategies were constructed using double-stranded DNA-modified magnetic
beads (dsDNA-MBs) and their performances for detection of miRNA were
studied comparatively. Both proportional and exponential amplification
DNA circuit systems enabled the detection of target miRNA (miR-141)
at room temperature without the need for additional enzymes because
miR-141 acted as a catalyst for successive toehold-mediated DNA displacement
reactions. A significant increase in the noise fluorescence signal
was observed for the exponential amplification DNA circuit system
because of the leakage (undesired DNA displacement reaction) revealed
by the kinetic study on each DNA displacement reaction. Nevertheless,
the exponential amplification DNA circuit system showed a lower limit
of detection (LOD: 46 pM) and shorter assay time (15 min) compared
to those of the proportional amplification DNA circuit system (LOD:
103 pM at 180 min). It is most likely that the exponential amplification
DNA circuit system enabled amplification of both the signals and target
miR-141, whereas the proportional amplification DNA circuit system
enabled amplification of the signals alone. In addition, the exponential
amplification DNA circuit system was able to discriminate between
mismatched base sequences in miR-200 family members and specifically
detect miR-141 even in the presence of serum. These findings are important
for the rational design for POCT systems.

Introduction
Circulating
microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as a new class
of relatively noninvasive (i.e., blood-based) biomarkers for various
diseases because expression profiles of miRNAs are reported to be
different between abnormal and normal cells.1−4 A significant challenge is to
detect circulating miRNAs directly from serum because of their possible
application to point-of-care testing (POCT) systems.5−7 Currently, the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) method is the “gold standard method”
for expression profiling analysis of circulating miRNA in serum samples.8−10 However, coexisting materials in serum easily inhibit enzymatic
reactions, including synthesis of complimentary DNA (cDNA) through
reverse transcription of miRNA and amplification of cDNA based on
PCR. Therefore, miRNA-specific qRT-PCR still requires tedious processes
such as the isolation of total miRNA from exosomes in serum samples.11−14 Additional problems for miRNA-specific qRT-PCR are the use of instruments
to precisely control thermal cycling. On the basis of these facts,
miRNA-specific qRT-PCR is considerably difficult to use for POCT systems.
Hence, a promising approach to POCT systems is believed to be the
development of an enzyme-free and isothermal assay system, achieving
detection of miRNAs directly from serum samples.

A new class
of enzyme-free and isothermal system, entropy-driven
catalytic reaction (the so-called DNA circuit system),15 has been devised on the basis of successive
toehold-mediated DNA displacement reactions.16 The DNA circuit system enables to amplify signals proportionally
at room temperature without any enzymes or instruments because the
target DNA (RNA) catalyzes successive toehold-mediated DNA displacement
reactions.17−21 Although proportional amplification DNA circuit systems have been
used for the detection of miRNAs, an assay time over several hours
is needed to detect low concentrations of target miRNAs. Meanwhile,
DNA circuit systems based on an exponential amplification strategy
have also been reported,15,22,23 which enable amplification of both signals and target nucleic acids,
and thus, PCR-like, this system is considered to be the best candidate
for miRNA-based POCT systems. However, the number of reports on exponential
amplification DNA circuit systems is limited and furthermore comparative
studies of the analytical performances of proportional and exponential
amplification DNA circuit systems have not been reported. Accordingly,
it is important to clarify the performance and problems of the exponential
amplification DNA circuit system when considering the rational design
for POCT systems.

As presented here, two types of a DNA circuit
system based on proportional
(Figure 1a) and exponential
amplification strategies (Figure 1b) were constructed using double-stranded DNA-modified
magnetic beads (dsDNA-MBs) and their analytical performances, including
the limit of detection (LOD), assay time, and kinetics were studied
comparatively. One of the most troublesome defects in DNA circuit
systems is leakage, causing the generation of noise signals even in
the absence of the target nucleic acid, caused by (i) impurity of
dsDNAs and (ii) undesired DNA displacement reactions.15 Because the source of dsDNA impurity (single-stranded DNAs)
is mainly partially formed dsDNA due to imperfect stoichiometry, dsDNA
should be purified by electrophoresis to ensure proper stoichiometry
and improve purity. The use of dsDNA-MB in place of free dsDNA does
not require the time-consuming purification of dsDNA by electrophoresis
because impurity of dsDNA-MB is easily removed by washing under a
magnetic field, eliminating the leakage by dsDNA impurity. Both proportional
and exponential amplification DNA circuit systems were able to detect
target miRNA at room temperature without any enzymes. Unlike the proportional
amplification DNA circuit system, a significant increase in the noise
signal was observed for the exponential amplification DNA circuit
system due to the leakage caused by undesired DNA displacement reactions.
Nevertheless, the exponential amplification DNA circuit system showed
lower LOD and shorter assay time compared to that of the proportional
amplification DNA circuit system. Eventually, the exponential amplification
DNA circuit system allows for a rapid assay for detecting target miRNA
at concentrations as low as 46 pM in 15 min, as well as discriminating
base-mismatched miR-200 family sequences.

Results and Discussion
Design Principle of Proportional
and Exponential Amplification
DNA Circuits
The current study reports on a comparative study
of the proportional and exponential amplification strategies for DNA
circuit systems (Figure 1). Table S1 shows miRNA and DNA sequences
used in this study. As a proof of concept, hsa-miR-141 (miR-141) was
chosen as a target miRNA because expression profiles of miR-141 in
serum are reported to be different between healthy persons and cancer
patients.24 Two types of dsDNA (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f)
and dsDNA (2) (S-4/S-5f/trigger) were added to DNA-modified MB to
prepare dsDNA-MBs (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f) and (2) (S-4/S-5f/trigger), respectively,
and the resulting dsDNA-MBs (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f) and (2) (S-4/S-5f/trigger)
were washed repeatedly with buffer under a magnetic field to remove
any impurity (undesired single-stranded DNAs). The target miR-141
causes the toehold-mediated DNA displacement reaction with DNA (S-2)
in dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f), resulting in the formation of an intermediate
containing a newly formed toehold structure. Subsequently, the release
of the miR-141 and a 6-carboxy-fluorescein (FAM)-labeled DNA (S-3f)
from the intermediate occurs by fuel DNA through the toehold-mediated
DNA displacement reaction. The released target miR-141 can be recycled
as a catalyst for the DNA circuit, and the proportional amplification
of the fluorescence signal starts a new (proportional amplification
strategy: Figure 1a).
Additionally, the released DNA (S-2) induces the release of trigger
DNA and FAM-labeled DNA (S-5f) from dsDNA-MB (2) (S-4/S-5f/trigger)
through the toehold-mediated DNA displacement reaction. The released
trigger DNA can also act as a catalyst for the DNA circuit because
of the sequence of trigger DNA being identical to that of the miR-141,
and the exponential amplification of both the fluorescence signal
and the trigger DNAs equivalent with miR-141 occurs (exponential amplification
strategy: Figure 1b).
Thus, the exponential amplification DNA circuit system is a simple
expansion of the proportional amplification DNA circuit system, allowing
an easy comparison of their analytical performances.

Performance
of Proportional and Exponential Amplification DNA
Circuits
To evaluate the proportional amplification DNA circuit,
dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f) ([dsDNA (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f)] = 10 nM) was
incubated in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing 12.5 mM
MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 in the presence
of fuel DNA (10 nM) and various concentrations of miR-141 (100 pM
to 8 nM). Fluorescence intensity in the mixture was monitored at 522
nm at 25 °C for 180 min; the fluorescence intensity was normalized
as follows: normalized F = (Ft – F0)/(Fmax – F0), where Ft, Fmax, and F0 are fluorescence intensities at t min, 10 nM of dsDNA (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f), and 0 min, respectively.
Notably, a significant increase in the normalized F was observed for the mixture of dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f), fuel
DNA, and miR-141 with different concentrations (Figure 2) and both the values and increase rates
of the normalized F are concentration-dependent on
miR-141. However, the mixture of dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f) and fuel
DNA showed a slight increase in the normalized F even
in the absence of miR-141 due to leakage caused by an undesired entropy-driven
DNA displacement reaction between fuel DNA and dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f).
Consequently, 100 pM of miR-141 could be detectable within 180 min
and the turnover number of miR-141 is roughly four cycles (100 pM
of miR-141 reacted with 397 pM of dsDNA (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f) on dsDNA-MB
(1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f) above the baseline set by the presence of fuel
DNA and absence of miR-141). These facts obviously demonstrate that
proportional amplification of the normalized F is
due to a miR-141-triggered DNA circuit mechanism.

Figure 2 Normalized F of the proportional DNA circuit system
as a function of time at different miR-141 concentrations in the presence
of fuel DNA (10 nM). Normalized F represents that
1.0 is the fluorescence of 10 nM of FAM. Gray circles are normalized F of the dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f) alone. Mean values
and standard deviations were obtained from three independent experiments.

An exponential amplification DNA
circuit system was constructed
by adding dsDNA-MB (2) (S-4/S-5f/trigger) to a mixture containing
the dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f), fuel DNA, and miR-141. Ideally, this
DNA circuit system should enable amplification of both the normalized F as well as the trigger DNA (equivalent to miR-141) by
2n-fold, with n being
the number of circuit cycles. Figure 3a shows the normalized F as a function
of time at different concentrations of miR-141 (10 pM to 5 nM). The
normalized F exhibited a typical sigmoidal curve
with an abrupt increase and a plateau after 180 min. In addition,
the normalized F in the absence of miR-141 showed
a substantial increase after 30 min. Note that the time needed to
reach the normalized F of 0.4 (the Ct value) was also proportionally dependent on the
log-concentration of miR-141 at 50 pM to 5 nM (Figure 3b), strongly indicating exponential amplification
of both the fluorescence signal and the trigger DNA (miR-141). Taken
together, these findings revealed that the concentration of miR-141
was responsible for the rise time of the normalized F. The delayed exponential increase in the normalized F observed even in the absence of miR-141 is most likely due to the
released DNA (S-2) by leakage through an undesired DNA displacement
reaction between fuel DNA and dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f), viz., the
released DNA (S-2) starts nonspecific amplification of both the fluorescence
signal and the trigger DNA.

standard deviations were obtained from three independent experiments.

Kinetic Study on the Proportional
and Exponential Amplification
DNA Circuits
The toehold-mediated DNA displacement reaction
involves a two-step process. The first step is to form several base
pairs at the toeholds, and then the second step is a branch migration
process to form complete dsDNA along with the release of outgoing
DNA. A model of bimolecular kinetic can be applied to the kinetics
of the toehold-mediated DNA displacement reactions.25−27Figure 4 shows models of each toehold-mediated
DNA displacement reaction in both proportional and exponential amplification
DNA circuit systems. Because the toehold-mediated DNA displacement
reactions with an appropriate toehold length proceed rapidly, the
back reactions can be negligible (see the Supporting Information).25 To estimate the
individual rate constants k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, kL1, and kL2, all DNA displacement
reactions were carried out in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7
containing 150 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.01 (v/v %)
Tween 20 at 25 °C, with all DNA concentrations of 10 nM. The
time-dependent increase in the fluorescence signal in the mixture
was monitored (Figure S1), and the rate
constants were determined from the equation (see eq SI4 in the Supporting Information). Note that the rate
constants k1 (4.2 × 105 M–1 s–1), k2 (1.3 × 105 M–1 s–1), k4 (6.0 × 105 M–1 s–11), and k5 (3.4 × 105 M–1 s–1) are of the same order of magnitude as the
rate constants of the DNA circuit system using free DNA in solution.15 Additionally, the rate constant k3 (3.7 × 104 M–1 s–1) was the lowest among k1–k5, indicating that this process
is the rate-determining step in both proportional and exponential
amplification DNA circuit systems. The lower rate constant observed
for k3 is presumably due to a shorter
toehold length (4 nt) compared to that of other toehold-mediated DNA
displacement reactions (6 nt). However, significantly lower rate constants kL1 (5.5 × 102 M–1 s–1) and kL2 (9.0
× 10 M–1 s–1) were observed
for leakage caused by entropy-driven DNA displacement reactions between
fuel DNA and dsDNA-MB (1) (S-1/S-2/S-3f) and rate constant kL1 was one-order higher than kL2. Therefore, the proportional amplification DNA circuit
system can amplify signal generation by over 2 orders of magnitude
(k3/kL2 =
411). Meanwhile, the nonspecific amplification observed for the exponential
amplification DNA circuit system (Figure 3) is due to the low k3/kL1 ratio (= 67), viz., the released
DNA (S-2) by leakage causes the release of trigger DNA from dsDNA-MB
(2) (S-4/S-5f/trigger).

DNA circuit

experiments.

Sensitivity and Assay Times
of Proportional and Exponential
Amplification DNA Circuits
Figure 5 shows the normalized F of
both proportional (Figure 5a) and exponential amplification DNA circuit systems (Figure 5b) with various concentrations
of miR-141 at different assay times (15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180
min). The normalized F of proportional and exponential
amplification DNA circuit systems proportionally correlated to the
concentration of miR-141, and the LODs (calculated 3 times the standard
deviation (σ) of the leak signal, i.e., normalized F at 0 M (leak signal) + 3σ) are summarized in Table 1. The LODs of the proportional
amplification DNA circuit system decreased with an increase in assay
time, achieving the lowest LOD (103 pM) after 180 min. This is due
to proportional amplification of normalized F caused
by the miR-141-triggered DNA circuit mechanism. In sharp contrast,
the LODs of the exponential amplification DNA circuit system did not
depend on assay time (15–60 min), viz., LODs were found to
be almost constant values (40–50 pM) due to nonspecific exponential
amplification caused by leakage. It should be noted that the LODs
of the exponential amplification DNA circuit system had an LOD (46
pM) even after 15 min that was ca. 20-fold lower compared to that
of the proportional amplification DNA circuit system (LOD: 1.1 nM
at 15 min). Because the concentration of miR-141 was responsible for
the rise time of the normalized F, the real-time
fluorescence signal curves could be used as the measure for quantitative
analysis of miR-141. The LOD was also calculated to be 36 pM from Figure 3b. Moreover, the
exponential amplification DNA circuit system had a dynamic range over
3 orders of magnitude of miR-141 concentrations and the dynamic range
of the exponential amplification DNA circuit system was wider than
that of the proportional amplification DNA circuit system. The lower
LOD, shorter assay time, and wider dynamic range are based on the
exponential amplification of both the normalized F and the trigger DNA.

Specificity of Exponential Amplification DNA Circuit
Another important consideration is specificity because miRNA family
members are known to have homologous sequences. Target miR-141 belongs
to miR-200 family members, including miR-429, miR-200a, miR-200b,
and miR-200c.24 A similar assay procedure
was employed for the exponential amplification DNA circuit system
using miR-200 family members. Figure 6 shows the comparison between the normalized F at 15 min of different miRNAs (100 pM and 1 nM), and Figure S2 also shows the normalized F as a function of time and Ct values.
Note that normalized F at 15 min and Ct values of miR-200 family members except for miR-141
were similar to those of the leakage (miRNA = 0 M) and miR-141 induced
the highest normalized F and the smallest Ct values, demonstrating that the exponential
amplification DNA circuit system allows for discriminating between
other miR-200 family members and miR-141. These results are due to
the high capability of toehold-mediated DNA displacement reactions
to discriminate mismatched base sequences.28

Mean values and standard deviations were obtained from three independent
experiments.

Detection of Target miRNA
in the Presence of Serum by Exponential
Amplification DNA Circuit
To demonstrate the feasibility
of a more practical application of the exponential amplification DNA
circuit system, detection of miR-141 from exosome-free fetal bovine
serum (Exo-FBS) was conducted by spiking different concentrations
of miR-141 (100 pM and 1 nM) into Exo-FBS. Exo-FBS as a realistically
complex matrix is known to inhibit enzymatic reactions used in qRT-PCR.11−14Table 2 shows the
normalized F at 15 min and Ct values at different concentrations of miR-141 (100 pM and 1 nM)
in the presence (10%) and absence of FBS, and Figure S3 also shows the normalized F as
a function of time. Notably, the exponential amplification DNA circuit
system showed no change in normalized F at 15 min
or Ct values with high reproducibility,
even in the presence of 10% FBS. Thus, satisfactory recovery (95.3–103.9%)
and a low relative standard deviation (RSD: 2.8–6.2%) were
observed, indicating serum does not interfere with the exponential
amplification DNA circuit process through successive toehold-mediated
DNA displacement reactions. These results indicate that the exponential
amplification DNA circuit system shows great promise as a practical
application for the detection of miRNAs directly from real samples.

Conclusions
The
current study describes a comparative study of DNA circuit
system-based proportional and exponential amplification strategies
for enzyme-free detection of miRNA at room temperature. The proportional
and exponential amplification DNA circuit systems were constructed
using dsDNA-MBs. The use of dsDNA-MBs in place of free dsDNAs allowed
easy elimination of the leakage caused by impurity of dsDNA because
impurity of dsDNA-MBs is easily removable by washing under a magnetic
field without the time-consuming purification process by electrophoresis.
Both proportional and exponential amplification DNA circuit systems
were able to detect miR-141 at room temperature without the need for
additional enzymes because the miR-141 acted as a catalyst for successive
toehold-mediated DNA displacement reactions. A slight increase in
noise fluorescence signal was observed for the proportional amplification
DNA circuit system, whereas the exponential amplification DNA circuit
system showed a significant increase in noise fluorescence signal
due to the leakage caused by undesired DNA displacement reactions.
The kinetic study of each toehold DNA displacement reaction in DNA
circuit systems revealed that ratio (k3/kL1) of rate constants of the rate-determining
step (k3) and leakage step (kL1) for the exponential amplification DNA circuit system
was lower than that for the proportional amplification DNA circuit
system (k3/kL2), indicating that this finding was in accordance with the observed
noise signals. Nevertheless, the exponential amplification DNA circuit
system showed a lower LOD (46 pM) and shorter assay time (15 min)
compared with those of the proportional amplification DNA circuit
system (LOD: 103 pM in 180 min). In addition, the exponential amplification
DNA circuit system was able to discriminate between differences in
base mismatches in miR-200 family members and detect miR-141 even
in the presence of serum. These findings revealed that suppression
of the leakage in the exponential amplification DNA circuit system
is an important issue for the development of miRNA-based POCT systems.

150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 to adjust 6 × 108 MBs mL–1 concentration. To quantify the amount
of immobilized capture DNA strands on MB, FAM-labeled capture DNA
(capture DNA-F) was used in place of capture DNA. Procedures for the
preparation and the purification of FAM-labeled capture DNA-modified
MB were the same as those described above. Fluorescence intensity
at 522 nm aliquots of the supernatant were converted to molar concentrations
of capture DNA-F by interpolation from a standard linear calibration
curve prepared with known concentrations of capture DNA-F using identical
buffer pH, salt, and Tween 20 concentrations. The average number of
capture DNA-F per MB particle was (2.16 ± 0.17) × 106 strands per MB (immobilization efficiency: 27%), calculated
by dividing the measured DNA molar concentration by the MB concentration.

A solution of DNA-MB in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing
150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (200 μL, 1.2 × 108 MBs) was added to a 1.5 mL PCR tube, and the DNA-MB was pulled
to the wall of the reaction tube by application of a magnetic field
to remove buffer solution. Each solution of dsDNAs (1) and (2) in
10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01
(v/v %) Tween 20 (76 μL, [dsDNA (1)] = [dsDNA (2)] = 1 μM)
was separately added to DNA-MB (1.2 × 108 MBs) to
prepare dsDNA-MB (1) and dsDNA-MB (2), respectively, and the mixtures
were incubated with gentle mixing at 25 °C for 60 min. The dsDNA-MB
(1) and dsDNA-MB (2) were pulled to the wall of the reaction tube
by application of a magnetic field. Both dsDNA-MB (1) and dsDNA-MB
(2) were then washed three times using 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer
pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (400 μL),
and supernatants were corrected to quantify the amount of immobilized
dsDNA (1) and (2) strands on MB. In addition, fresh 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (1000
μL) was added to the dsDNA-MB (1) and dsDNA-MB (2) and the mixtures
were incubated further with gentle mixing at 25 °C for 6 h to
remove nonspecific adsorbed dsDNAs (1) and (2). The dsDNA-MB (1) and
dsDNA-MB (2) were pulled to the wall of the reaction tube by application
of a magnetic field and washed three times using 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (400
μL). Fluorescence intensity at 522 nm of all supernatants was
converted to molar concentrations of dsDNAs (1) and (2) by interpolation
from a standard linear calibration curve prepared with known concentrations
of dsDNAs (1) and (2) using identical buffer pH, salt, and Tween 20
concentrations. The average number of dsDNAs (1) and (2) per dsDNA-MB
(1) and dsDNA-MB (2) was (2.70 ± 0.21) × 105 strands
per MB (immobilization efficiency: 71%) and (2.82 ± 0.15) ×
105 strands per MB (immobilization efficiency: 74%), respectively,
as calculated by dividing the measured DNA molar concentration by
the MB concentration. The dsDNA-MB (1) and dsDNA-MB (2) were dispersed
in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and
0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 to adjust 50 nM concentrations of dsDNAs (1)
and (2).

Detection of miR-141 by the Proportional Amplification DNA Circuit
System
A solution of the dsDNA-MB (1) in 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (40
μL, [dsDNA (1)] = 50 nM) was added to a 0.5 mL PCR tube, and
the dsDNA-MB (1) was pulled to the wall of the reaction tube by application
of a magnetic field to remove buffer solution. To the dsDNA-MB (1),
10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01
(v/v %) Tween 20 (170 μL), 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7
containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20, and 250 mM of MgCl2 (10 μL), fuel DNA in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH
7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (200 nM, 10 μL),
and various concentrations of miR-141 solutions in 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (2–160
nM, 10 μL) were added, and the total volume was 200 μL.
Final concentrations of Mg2+, dsDNA (1), fuel DNA, and
miR-141 were 12.5 mM, 10 nM, 10 nM, and 100 pM to 8 nM, respectively.
The resulting mixture was incubated with gentle mixing at 25 °C
for 180 min. During the incubation, fluorescence intensity at 522
nm was measured at appropriate time intervals after precipitation
of dsDNA-MB (1) by application of a magnetic field. Furthermore, measured
fluorescence intensity was normalized as follows (Ft – F0)/(Fmax – F0), where Ft, Fmax, and F0 are fluorescence intensity at t min, fluorescence intensity at 10 nM of dsDNA (1), and fluorescence
intensity at 0 min, respectively.

Detection of miR-141 by
the Exponential Amplification DNA Circuit
System
A solution of the dsDNA-MB (1) in 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (40
μL, [dsDNA (1)] = 50 nM) was added to a 0.5 mL PCR tube, and
the dsDNA-MB (1) was pulled to the wall of the reaction tube by application
of a magnetic field to remove buffer solution. To the dsDNA-MB (1),
a solution of the dsDNA-MB (2) in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH
7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (40 μL,
[dsDNA (2)] = 50 nM) was added, and both the dsDNA-MB (1) and dsDNA-MB
(2) were pulled to the wall of the reaction tube by application of
a magnetic field to remove buffer solution. To the mixture of dsDNA-MB
(1) and dsDNA-MB (2), 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing
150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (170 μL), 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20, and 250
mM of MgCl2 (10 μL), fuel DNA in 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (200
nM, 10 μL), and various concentrations of miR-141 solutions
in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and
0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (20 pM to 100 nM, 10 μL) were added, and
the total volume was 200 μL. Final concentrations of Mg2+, dsDNA (1), fuel DNA, and miR-141 were 12.5 mM, 10 nM, 10
nM, and 1 pM to 5 nM, respectively. The resulting mixture was incubated
with gentle mixing at 25 °C for 180 min. During the incubation,
fluorescence intensity at 522 nm was measured at appropriate time
intervals after precipitation of the dsDNA-MB (1) and the dsDNA-MB
(2) by application of a magnetic field. Furthermore, the measured
fluorescence intensity was normalized as follows: (Ft – F0)/(Fmax – F0), where Ft, Fmax, and F0 are fluorescence intensity at t min, total fluorescence intensity at 10 nM of dsDNA (1) and at 10
nM of dsDNA (2), and fluorescence intensity at 0 min, respectively.

Determination of Rate Constants of DNA Displacement Reactions
To determine the individual rate constants k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, kL1, and kL2, FAM-labeled
DNAs (S-2f and trigger-f) and FAM-miR-141 (miR-141f) were also used.
The procedures for the preparation and the purification of dsDNA-MBs
were identical to those described above. Each DNA displacement reaction
was carried out in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing
150 mM NaCl, 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20, and 12.5 mM of MgCl2 at 25 °C, and final concentrations of dsDNAs and other single-stranded
DNAs and RNAs (fuel DNA, S-2, miR-141, and miR-141f) were same as
10 nM. During the incubation, fluorescence intensity at 522 nm was
measured at appropriate time intervals after precipitation of the
dsDNA-MBs by application of a magnetic field. Furthermore, measured
fluorescence intensity was normalized as follows: (Ft – Fblank)/(Fmax – Fblank), where Ft, Fmax, and Fblank are fluorescence intensity at t s, fluorescence intensity at 10 nM of dsDNA, and fluorescence
intensity of dsDNA-MB alone at t s, respectively.
Thus, normalized F corresponds to the reaction efficiency
(0–1) of each DNA displacement reaction. Figure S1a,b shows the time-dependent increase in normalized F, and the rate constants k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, kL1, and kL2 were determined
from the fitting eq SI4 (see the Supporting
Information) using normalized F values and the kinetic
model (see the Supporting Information).

Discrimination of Base Mismatches in miR-141 Family Members
Except for the use of miR-429, miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c
(100 pM and 1 nM), the detection procedure and conditions were identical
to those described above.

Detection of miR-141 in the Presence of Serum
A solution
of guanidine thiocyanate in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing
150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (4 M, 500 μL) was added
to exosome-free FBS (500 μL) to deactivate DNase and RNase,
and the FBS–guanidine mixture was incubated for 10 min at room
temperature. Solutions of miR-141 in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer
pH 7.7 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 (v/v %) Tween 20 (95.4 nM and
0.954 nM, 10 μL) were separately added to the FBS–guanidine
mixture (190 μL), and the total volume of FBS solutions was
200 μL ([FBS] = 49.7% (v/v), [guanidine thiocyanate] = 1.9 M,
[miR-141] = 4.77 and 0.477 nM). The resulting FBS (42 μL) solutions
containing miR-141 (4.77 and 0.477 nM) were used to the assay mixture,
as described above. Final concentrations of FBS, guanidine thiocyanate,
and miR-141 were 10%, 0.4 M, and 1.0 nM or 100 pM, respectively, and
the detection procedure and conditions were identical to those described
above. Although increase in fluorescence intensity was observed for
all samples containing FBS, the normalized F values
were the same as those of the samples in the absence of FBS.
