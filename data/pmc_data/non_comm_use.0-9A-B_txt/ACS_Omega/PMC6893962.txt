Due to the availability, biodegradability, and biological
effects,
lignin has emerged as an interesting alternative to petroleum-based
compounds for developing sustainable chemicals, materials, and composites.
In this study, lignin at various concentrations was incorporated into
methacrylate resin via solution blending to fabricate lignin-reinforced
composites using stereolithography apparatus three-dimensional printing.
Softwood kraft lignin in the amounts of 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0
wt % in the methacrylate resin was used as a printing ink, and the
gel contents and relative contents of the residual resin in the printed
samples with various lignin concentrations were measured. The effects
of the lignin on the ultimate mechanical properties of the non-postcured
and postcured printed composites were determined. The tensile testing
results revealed that the incorporation of lignin in the composite
increased the tensile strength by 46–64% and Young’s
modulus by 13–37% for the postcured printed composites compared
with that of the control sample (no lignin added). Employing a 0.4
wt % softwood kraft lignin, the tensile strength of the postcured
printed composite reached the highest value of 49.0 MPa, which was
a 60% increase in comparison to that of the control sample with 30.7
MPa. Scanning electron microscopy images of the fracture samples illustrated
that the lignin-incorporated composites exhibited a rougher fracture
surface that can presumably dissipate the stress, which could be a
contributing factor for the mechanical enhancement.

1 Introduction
Three-dimensional (3D)
printing is a computer-aided additive manufacturing
method that has gained growing attention due to its capability to
fabricate high-shape-complexity products without molds.1 Several techniques, such as fused deposition
modeling (FDM), direct ink writing, powder bed fusion, binder jetting,
vat photopolymerization, sheet lamination, and stereolithography,
have been applied in the 3D printing process. Among these techniques,
the stereolithography apparatus (SLA) uses UV light to solidify and
cure a liquid ink through photopolymerization that allows for superior
accuracy control and high resolution (up to 10 μm/layer) during
the layer-by-layer printing process.2 However,
the requirement of photoreactive resin in stereolithography narrows
the selection of the starting material2 and, in turn, limits the applications of the resultant products.
To overcome this shortcoming and obtain SLA products with various
functions, researchers have developed various types of modified photoreactive
resins.3−8 One of the methods is blending fillers with resins. For example,
carbon materials, such as graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, renowned
for their high-performance mechanical properties, were added as enhanced
fillers in the resin system to improve the mechanical performance
of the printed materials.4,9,10 Apart from carbon materials, other inorganic particles (nanoclay,
aluminum oxide nanowires, sepiolite nanofibers, TiO2,
and SiO2) have also been incorporated into the stereolithography
process.11−13 These reports suggest that the incorporation of fillers
in photoreactive resins is a promising means to improve the mechanical
properties of the SLA-printed products.

Of the many additives
available, lignin shows significant research
interest, particularly in the advent of bioeconomy.14 With the addition of lignin as a filler, a variety of studies
have shown that the resulting polymeric composites exhibit improved
physical properties including antiaging,15 flame retardant,16 and UV absorption.17 3D-printed lignin-based materials have been
investigated for the application as drug-delivery materials18,19 and bio-based plastics and composites for scaffold in the medical
engineering area.19 From the perspective
of improving the mechanical properties of composites, lignin can be
employed as a stiff filler,10,13 in much the same manner
as it performs in vascular plants contributing to cell wall rigidity
and durability. Therefore, several researchers had applied lignin
in the field of 3D printing for biomaterials and composites, and studied
on the reinforcement of lignin on the printed materials. Using an
FDM 3D printing technique, Nguyen et al.20 have shown that the incorporation of hardwood lignin (40 wt %) into
nylon 12 increased Young’s modulus of printed samples from
∼1.77 to ∼3.01 GPa and maintained the tensile strength
at ∼55 MPa. The authors attributed the enhancement to the rigid
phenolic units in lignin. This type of reinforcement in modulus may
also be ascribed to the potential hydrogen bonds between lignin and
nylon according to the report by Sallem-Idrissi et al.21 Gkartzou et al.22 reported the reinforcement of pine kraft lignin in FDM-printed sample
of polylactide/lignin composite at various lignin concentrations.
The Young’s modulus of composites increased from ∼2.31
GPa (0 wt % lignin) to ∼2.33 GPa (5 wt % lignin), 2.41 GPa
(10 wt % lignin), and ∼2.39 GPa (15 wt % lignin), while the
tensile strength decreased with more lignin being added. Mimini et
al.23 compared the influence of kraft lignin,
organosolv lignin, and lignosulfonate on the flexural and impact strengths
of FDM-printed composite with PLA. The results showed a slight reduction
on both flexural and impact strengths with blending 5, 10, and 15
wt % of the three species of additive. In terms of stereolithography
3D printing, Feng et al. printed composites with methacrylate/lignin-coated
cellulose resin. They found that 0.5 wt % or less lignin-coated cellulose
nanocrystals in the printed composite slightly improved the tensile
strength and modulus of the postcured samples. However, the tensile
performance dropped down when more filler (max to 1.0 wt %) was blended.24 Another report by Sutton et al. proposed a method
to modify lignin into photoreactive fillers (i.e., methacrylic anhydride-modified
lignin), which could be photopolymerized with a methacrylate resin
in the printing process.25 The reported
mechanical tests indicated that the elastic modulus decreased from
0.65 to 0.37 GPa, while the elongation increased from 1.87 to 7.62%
with the addition of 15 wt % modified lignin of the printed composites.
All of the abovementioned reports had clearly highlighted that on
the one hand, lignin plays a crucial role as a sustainable filler
in impacting the performance of 3D-printed products. On the other
hand, the reinforcing effect of lignin seems complicated depending
on the lignin source, content, polymer resin, and the printing techniques
used. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, limited studies15 have been reported on the effect of incorporation
of lignin into stereolithography 3D printing.

In this study,
a softwood kraft lignin is applied as a filler in
stereolithography 3D printing to reinforce the mechanical properties
of printed products. The methacrylate resin was selected for its commercial
availability and widespread application in the 3D printing field.
Printed samples with slurry blends of lignin and methacrylate resin
were prepared, and it was determined that low charges of lignin (0.2–1.0
wt %) could significantly improve the mechanical performance (both
Young’s modulus and tensile strength) of the fabricated lignin-reinforced
composite, which may extend the application of lignin-reinforced stereolithography
products. The changes in the fracture morphology of the composites
were suggestive of the mechanism of improved mechanical behavior of
lignin composite in the 3D printing of these photoreactive resins.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Printability of the Mixed Resin
The
blended resin was used to print a “Tennessee” pattern
to show the printability of the blended resin. Figure 1a shows that the whole pattern was composed
of printed parts with various lignin concentrations (i.e., 0.0, 0.2,
0.5, 0.8, 1.0 wt %). A higher concentration of lignin darkens the
printed sample (Figure 1a) and makes the printed sample softer (Figure 1b,c).

of lignin; (b,
c) Stiffness estimation of the printed sample with various lignin
concentrations by holding the same weight (b-0.2 wt %, c-1.0 wt %).
The sample with higher lignin concentration has lower stiffness. All
of the scale bars are 1 cm.

2.2 Determination of Lignin Concentration in the
Printed Sample
To measure the lignin concentration in the
3D-printed composites, the concentrations of lignin in the printed
samples were measured and calculated with the samples N-0.2%, N-0.4%,
N-0.5%, N-0.8%, and N-1.0% using UV–vis spectroscopic analysis.26 The measured results in Table 1 indicated that the lignin concentration
in the printed samples is in accordance with the feed ratio, but the
measured lignin concentrations were higher than that from the feed
ratio. This may be attributed to the settling of lignin in the resin
tank by gravity hence lignin was incorporated into the composites
during the photopolymerization.

Resin and Measured Lignin Concentration in Printed Composites

N-1.0%	1.0 wt %	1.49 ± 0.89 wt %	
N-0.8%	0.8 wt %	1.02 ± 0.08 wt %	
N-0.5%	0.5 wt %	0.83 ± 0.04 wt %

N-0.2%	0.2 wt %	0.29 ± 0.04 wt %	
2.3 Gel Contents and Relative Residual Resin Contents
in the Printed Samples
The printed samples consisted of gel
fraction that cannot be dissolved (usually cross-linked network) and
nongel fraction that can be extracted out using acetone. The gel contents
from the printed samples decreased as more lignin was added into the
composites (Figure 2). There is ∼98 wt % gel in the printed sample without lignin,
which implied that the printed sample by pure resin was highly cross-linked.27

Figure 2 Gel contents of the printed samples with various lignin
concentrations.

With increasing lignin concentration in the composites,
less gel
was obtained in the printed composites, which indicated that the added
lignin likely hindered the cross-linking of the methacrylate resin
during the printing, in part, due to the UV absorption of the lignin.17 This decreased degree of cross-link is consistent
with the lower stiffness of the printed samples with higher lignin
concentration (Figure 1b).

We then used differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) to
investigate
the thermal behaviors of printed samples with an attempt to characterize
the polymerization status of the nongel part (Figure 3). It has been reported that the unreacted
resin in the printed sample will polymerize when the temperature increases,
releasing heat in the processing.28 As
shown in Table 2, all
of the non-post-cured samples have exothermic enthalpy, suggesting
the presence of unreacted resin in the printed samples. The increased
concentration of lignin leads to higher exotherm enthalpy values,
which implied that increased amounts of unreacted resin was present
in the composites. To confirm this is related to the unreacted resin
residual, we ran two postcured printed samples, P-0% and P-1.0%, as
well. By contrast, the postcured printed samples have no exothermic
behaviors (Figure 3), which can be explained by the relatively low amount of residual
resin after UV postcure. In addition, we found that the printed control
sample owns an exothermic peak at a higher temperature (163.5 °C),
while the other printed samples blended with lignin have exothermic
peaks appearing at a lower temperature (137.2–140.4 °C).
This phenomenon can be attributed to the low diffusion by the highly
cross-linked structure in the control sample, making polymerization
in highly cross-linked structures to require more energy (at a higher
temperature). Adding lignin in the printed sample caused more residual
resin and less-confined (cross-linked) structure, which requires lower
energy (thus lower temperature to initiate28) for curing the resin.

2.4 FTIR Analysis of the Non-Postcured Samples
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was performed
for the non-postcured samples, as well as the starting softwood kraft
lignin (Figure 4).
With regard to the softwood kraft lignin, the hydroxyl, carbonyl,
and typical aromatic skeletal vibrations29 of the kraft lignin were observed at 3362, 1678, and 1505 cm–1, respectively. The aromatic C–H in-plane deformation
in the guaiacyl ring at 1134 cm–1 of the lignin
can also be observed. In the printed samples, the C–H and CH3 on the backbone of the photoreacted polymer chain were observed
at 2959 and 2863 cm–1, respectively. The peaks appearing
at 3356 and 1700 cm–1 can be attributed to the −OH
stretching and C=O stretching, respectively. The −OH
stretching was attributed to the adsorption of water and −OH
from lignin during the fabrication process, as previously reported.3,25,28 Due to the low contents of lignin,
all of the abovementioned peaks of the printed control sample did
not show significant changes of intensities in the spectra compared
with the composites incorporated with a different amount of lignin
from 0.2 to 1.0 wt %. However, a subtle difference between the printed
control sample and the composites was found with respect to the peaks
located at 1638 and 1400–1100 cm–1. The minor
peak at 1638 cm–1 (Figure 4b) represents the stretching of C=C
of the residual methacrylate that was not photopolymerized during
the printing process,28 which increased
with the increasing amount of lignin added to the printing resin.
This was attributed to the presence of lignin that could hinder the
photopolymerization process, and the increasing lignin particles interfered
with the UV light absorption in the system more significantly. The
higher lignin incorporated accompanied by more unreacted residual
resin in a printed sample leads to a lower stiffness (Figure 1b,c). With respect to the spectra
between 1400 and 1100 cm–1, the intensities of the
multipeaks at 1350–1275 cm–1 (Figure 4c) were assigned to the methacrylate
ester and at the side chain of the polymer, which showed a gradual
rise as lignin concentration increased. The peak intensity at 1200–1120
cm–1 corresponding to the aromatic C–H in-plane
deformation of lignin increased with more lignin added (Figure 4d).25,28 These structural changes in printed samples indicated that the addition
of lignin had interfered with the polymerization of methacrylate resin.

softwood kraft lignin ((a) 4000–600 cm–1,
(b) 1660–1620 cm–1, (c) 1350–1275
cm–1, and (d) 1200–1100 cm–1).

2.5 Effects of Lignin on the Tensile Properties
of Printed Samples
After the samples were printed, UV postcuring
was performed to fully complete the polymerization in the resin, thereby
enhancing their mechanical properties.28 Based on the results (Figure S1), 4 h
was chosen for the postcure.

The effects of lignin on the tensile
performance of printed samples were analyzed by varying the lignin
loading concentration from 0.0 to 1.0 wt % in the resin system and
were compared in Figure 5. Comparing the non-postcured and postcured samples, all non-postcured
samples exhibit lower tensile strength at the same tensile strain
than that of the postcured with the same lignin concentration, and
all non-postcured samples show gradually weaker tensile performance
as more lignin was added. By contrast, all of the postcured lignin-added
samples have a significantly increased ultimate tensile strength at
break (45–50 MPa) than the control sample without lignin addition
(30.7 MPa). This result indicated that the softwood kraft lignin showed
a reinforcing effect to the methacrylate resin in the overall SLA
3D postcured printed samples. Also, the stress–strain curves
of P-0% and the P-0.2% show typical yielding before the ultimate break,
whereas the other samples with higher lignin addition do not show
yielding. This result meant, on one hand, the addition of lignin increased
the brittleness of the printed sample, and, on the other hand, there
was a lignin concentration threshold beyond which the deformation
behavior of the postcured printed sample has been changed.

Figure 5 Stress–strain
curves for non-postcured and postcured printed
samples with various lignin
concentrations.

To further analyze the tensile test results, the
tensile strengths
and Young’s modulus of postcured printed samples are compared
in Figure 6 (the data
for tensile strength and modulus are recorded in Table 3). With respect to the tensile
strength represented in Figure 6a, the tensile strength value of the printed sample without
lignin increased from 12.4 to 30.7 MPa after postcuring compared between
N-0% and P-0%. This data suggested that the photopolymerization during
printing was only partially completed and postcure was necessary to
enhance the mechanical properties. Concerning the printed composites,
the tensile strength showed a gradual decrease as more lignin was
added for non-postcured composites. The tendency can be attributed
to the hindering effect of the lignin on UV photopolymerization of
the resin during printing, which was consistent with the finding in
DSC that more residual methacrylate unreacted as more lignin was added.
The weaker tensile strength also results in printed samples with more
than 0.5 wt % lignin, which cannot be measured on the given load cell
for the tensile stress was lower than the minimum stress value can
be tested (5 MPa). It showed a similar trend on Young’s modulus
of the non-postcured samples (Figure 6b).

non-postcured
and postcured printed samples.

On the other hand, for postcured printed samples,
the tensile strength
increased significantly to 46.1 and 49.6 MPa at the lignin incorporation
levels of 0.2 and 0.4 wt %, respectively, which are 52 and 64% increment
improvement from 30.7 MPa. The tensile strength leveled off by adding
more lignin to 1.0 wt %. The incorporation of lignin has also resulted
in a remarkable increase of Young’s modulus of the printed/postcured
samples (Figure 6b).
With the addition of 0.2 wt % lignin, Young’s modulus increased
by 26% from 1.74 to 2.20 GPa. Further increasing the lignin concentration
to 0.8 wt % in the resin did not increase the modulus that remained
in the range of 2.10–2.50 GPa. However, when 1.0 wt % lignin
was added, the modulus steeply decreases to 1.98 GPa. The abovementioned
results of the tensile strength and modulus indicated that the incorporation
of a small amount of lignin to the methacrylate resin could significantly
reinforce the mechanical strength of the postcured printed composites.

2.6 Morphological Analysis of the Fracture Feature
of the Printed Samples
To examine the enhancement mechanism
of lignin on the printed samples, fractographic analysis of interfacial
bonding has been performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
P-0.2% was selected to make a comparison with P-0% control as it has
shown significant improvement of tensile strength with the lowest
lignin concentration. The surface of P-0.2% (Figure 7a) shows observable layer stack gaps every
∼100 μm, which is in accordance with the layer thickness
(0.1 mm) in printing while layer gaps can only be recognized at some
spots in the view as marked in Figure 7b for P-0%. By comparing the sample surface of P-0.2%
and P-0%, the surface of P-0.2% was much rougher than that of the
control sample. These differences were likely due to the hindering
effect of lignin on the UV photopolymerization printing process so
that the resin was not fully polymerized. Concerning the fracture
surface shown in Figure 7c,d, the fracture surface of both P-0.2% and P-0% showed a typical
“brittle” fraction. However, there is some difference
between them mainly on crack formation. The control shows a much smoother
surface with several long cracks (Figure 7d), while there was some uneven area instead
of conspicuous cracks on the failure surface of P-0.2% (Figure 7c). These morphological difference
of fracture surfaces can explain, in part, the increase of the tensile
strength by the theory of rigid filler particles toughing.30

Figure 7 SEM images of the surface (a, b) and cross section (fracture
surface)
(c, d) of P-0.2% (a, c) and P-0% (b, d).

The micromechanism of rigid filler particles toughing
includes
three steps as stress concentration, debonding, and shear yielding.
In this work, adding lignin can affect the stress concentration step
during tensile tests. Without lignin addition, the methacrylate resin
polymerized into a brittle polymer matrix after postcuring, which
resulted in an internal integrity structure that is prone to failure
at some weak points with stress loaded. The stress induced on the
cross section of the test sample will be concentrated on a few weak
points first and then break from there, leaving a smooth surface with
a few individual cracks observed in Figure 7d. By contrast, with rigid fillers (i.e.,
lignin microparticles in this study), the fillers increase the number
of stress concentration spots. Then, the stress will be dissipated
on more dispersed spots with a more distributed load that prevents
the stress concentration microscopically. The well-dispersed lignin
fillers at low concentration, therefore, enable the sample bearing
higher tensile stress macroscopically. This is possibly the reason
that the corresponding fracture surface of P-0.2% was uneven compared
with that of the P-0% control. In addition, Manapat et al. found a
similar fractographic morphology with printed graphene oxide composite
that is related to crack deflection.9 They
concluded that the rough bonding and interactions in the printed sample
lead to different stress distribution, which needs more energy for
crack propagation, thereby bearing more stress in a tensile test.
It seems that the incorporated lignin and graphene oxide played a
similar role in dissipating stress load in the composites that are
showing enhanced tensile properties.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, lignin-added
methacrylate resin composite with enhanced
tensile properties has been fabricated using 3D stereolithography
apparatus. The lignin concentration in the composite determined by
the UV–vis spectroscopic analysis revealed that the softwood
kraft lignin in the range of 0.2–1.0 wt % had been successfully
incorporated into methacrylate resin composite. Gel content measurement
and DSC tests illustrated that the printed sample without lignin was
highly cross-linked with low residual resin but increasing lignin
concentration will hinder the cross-link, thus leading to higher residual
resin in the printed sample. Postcuring has played a considerable
influence in completing the photoreaction showing significantly enhanced
mechanical properties compared with non-postcured analogs. The addition
of lignin had the enhancement of tensile stress of the composite,
and the fractographic analysis revealed a rough fracture surface in
the lignin-added composite. The added filler at a certain amount is
favorable for dissipating stress concentration that could be the primary
reason for the enhanced mechanical performance of the lignin-included
3D-printed composites.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials and Chemicals
Softwood
kraft lignin was acquired from an industrial source in the southeastern
USA and was used after purification following a published methodology.31 That is, shortly, the received dry kraft lignin
was first suspended and stirred in the NaOH solution with EDTA-2Na+. The stirred mixture was then filtrated through a filter
paper (Whatman 1), and the filtrate was then gradually acidified to
pH = 3.0 with 2 M H2SO4 and then stored at −20
°C overnight. After thawing, the precipitates were collected
by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with deionized water. The
obtained air-dried powder was then used in the following 3D printing
procedure. The hydroxyl content on the softwood kraft lignin was characterized
by 31P NMR in the Supporting Information (Figure S2 and Table S1).

Photoreactive methacrylate
resins (product code: RS-F2-GPCL-04), including methacrylate monomer
and oligomer and initiator, were purchased from Formlabs, Inc. Acetone
(≥99.5%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.9%) were
supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Inc. 2-Chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2
dioxaphospholane, endo-N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide,
pyridine, and deuterated chloroform and chromium acetylacetonate for
NMR were all of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Isopropyl alcohol (≥99.5%) was provided by Fisher Chemical.
All chemicals were used as received.

4.2 Fabrication of Lignin-Dispersed Resins
Lignin was dispersed into the methacrylate resin using a solution-blending
procedure. Lignin was first dispersed in acetone at a concentration
of 1.00 g/200.00 mL (lignin/acetone), and the resin was dissolved
in acetone separately in a ratio of 200.00 g/200.00 mL (resin/acetone).
The two solutions were blended independently and stirred overnight
at room temperature. The two solutions were then mixed by varying
feed ratios to control the lignin concentrations in the resin at 0.0,
0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 wt %. The resulting mixtures were stirred
further overnight followed by rotary evaporation for 4 h at 30 °C
to remove the acetone. All of these mixing steps were accomplished
in aluminum-foil-covered beakers and flasks to avoid any prepolymerization.
To measure the size of lignin in the acetone, dynamic light scattering
(DLS) and SEM were used, and the data is shown in the Supporting Information
(Figures S3 and S4).

4.3 3D Printing of the Samples
A stereolithography
file (.stl) of the required specimen shape (Type V dogbone in this
case) was created in a Siemens NX 10.0 program before 3D printing.
The printing processing was controlled by the printer software (Preform,
v.2.15.0, Formlabs, Inc.) using a stereolithography printer (Form
1 +, Formlab Inc.) equipped with a 405 nm UV light laser (Figure S5). The 3D printing process included
a layer-by-layer UV-light-induced free-radical polymerization of methacrylate
resin to form the shape of samples as designed, where the layer thickness,
which represents the resolution in the z-axis, was
chosen as 0.1 mm (Figure S5). After printing,
the samples were removed from the platform manually. They were then
soaked at room temperature for 10 min in an isopropyl alcohol bath
and another 10 min in a second isopropyl alcohol bath to remove unreacted
resin on the surfaces of samples following the reported procedure.25 The obtained sample was then stored in self-made
aluminum foil boxes in an ambient environment after air drying overnight
and designated as the non-postcured sample.

To postcure the
printed samples, a 36 W UV reactor (MelodySusie Co.) equipped with
two 9 W lamps centered at a wavelength of 365 nm lamp combined with
two 9 W LED centered at a wavelength of 405 nm was used. The UV intensity
of the postcure device was measured as 280 ± 16 μW/cm2 (SP-82UV, Lutron Pocket UV Intensity Meter) during the postcure,
and the data is shown in Table S2. The
samples were horizontally placed in the light reactor for a certain
amount of time to cure one side of the sample, and then the samples
are turned over for another period of the same time to cure the other
side of the sample. The total postcuring time was presented as the
sum up of the two time periods. The non-postcured and postcured samples
were designated as N-x and P-x,
respectively, where x represented the weight percentage
of lignin in the sample corresponding to 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8,
and 1.0 wt %. All of the non-post-cured and postcured samples were
kept in self-made aluminum foil boxes for further testing.

4.4 Characterization of Printed Samples
4.4.1 Determination of the Lignin Concentrations
in the Printed Sample
To determine lignin concentration in
the printed sample, the uncured printed sample was used because of
its higher solubility than the UV cured products in DMSO. The non-postcured
samples were first cut into small cubes (approximately 1 mm ×
1 mm × 1 mm) and then dissolved into DMSO. The cubes with different
lignin blending ratios (N-0.2%, N-0.4%, N-0.5%, N-0.8%, and N-1.0%)
were weighed (m1, ∼0.3 g) and then
dissolved in 20.00 mL DMSO with magnetic stirring at room temperature
for 24 h. The undissolved material was separated by centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm. The supernatant was pipetted out to measure
the UV absorption of lignin in the solvent using UV–vis spectrometer
at a wavelength of 300 nm with appropriate dilution.26 The dissolved lignin concentration in the supernatant (q, mg/mL) was determined according to the calibration curve
function from softwood kraft lignin/DMSO solution in various concentrations
(0.0160, 0.0252, 0.0260, 0.0330, and 0.0365 mg/mL) as described in
the Supporting Information (Figure S6).
The weight (m2, g) of the undissolved
residue was quantified after vacuum drying at 45 °C until the
weights were unchanged. The lignin concentration (c, %) in the printed samples was given by eq 1 with the assumption that the lignin concentration
(wt %) in the dissolved products is the same as that left in the undissolved
residue 1  where V is the volume of
the solution of the supernatant (20 mL).

4.4.2 Gel Contents
The gel contents of
the non-postcured and postcured printed samples were gravimetrically
determined after Soxhlet extraction using acetone for 48 h.27 The samples (∼0.2 g) were cut into similar
size (around 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm). The gel contents were
calculated using eq 2 2  in which the M0 represented the initial weights before the extraction and the M1 represented the weights after the extraction.
The measurement was conducted in triplicates.

4.4.3 Relative Contents of Unreacted Resin in
Printing
The relative contents of unreacted resin in the
printed sample were evaluated by differential scanning calorimeter
(DSC, Diamond, Perkin Elmer), which was calibrated with indium under
a nitrogen atmosphere before the tests. The printed samples (3–5
mg) were heated from 25 to 210 °C at 10 °C /min to record
the heat flow curves. The polymerization enthalpy was given by the
peak area of the exothermic peak during each scan.28

4.4.4 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR) Analysis
FTIR analysis of the 3D-printed non-postcured
composites was performed on a Perkin Elmer FTIR-ATR spectrometer II
at room temperature. The FTIR spectra were collected from 4000 to
600 cm–1 with 16 scans and a resolution of 4 cm–1.

4.4.5 Tensile Tests
Tensile testing of
the printed samples was performed using a universal testing machine
(Instron Co., model: Instron 5567) equipped with a 30 kN load cell
according to the ASTM standard D638 (Type V).32 Dogbone specimens were tested at an ambient temperature using a
crosshead speed of 1 mm/min for all of the samples. Young’s
modulus was obtained by linear fitting of the stress–strain
curves in the linear portion of the strain range33 (0.1–0.5%) in the current study. Young’s
modulus and tensile strength were determined and reported as an average
value of three test specimens.

4.4.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The morphology of the sample and fracture surfaces of the 3D-printed
composites were studied using an SEM (Zeiss dual-beam FIB/SEM instrument),
with an accelerating voltage of 3 kV. All samples were sputter-coated
with a thin layer of gold on the target surface to prevent the buildup
of electronic charge before observation.
