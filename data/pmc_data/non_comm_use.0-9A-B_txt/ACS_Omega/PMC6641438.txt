Nanostructured
molybdenum oxides are promising materials for energy
storage, catalysis, and electronic-based applications. Herein, we
report the synthesis of MoO3–x nanosheets
(x stands for oxygen vacancy) via an environmentally
friendly liquid exfoliation approach. The process involves the reflux
of the bulk α-MoO3 precursor in water at 80 °C
for 7 days. Electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy show that
the MoO3–x nanosheets are a few
nanometer thick. MoO3–x nanosheets
exhibit near infrared plasmonic property that can be enhanced by visible
light irradiation for a short time (10 min). Photocatalytic activity
of MoO3–x nanosheets for organic
dye decolorization is examined using two different dyes (rhodamine
B and methylene blue). Under visible light irradiation, MoO3–x nanosheets make a rapid decolorization for the dye
molecules in less than 10 min. The simple synthesis procedure of MoO3–x nanosheets combined with their
remarkable photochemical properties reflect the high potential for
using the nanosheets in a variety of applications.

1 Introduction
Inorganic
two-dimensional materials such as transition metal oxides,
carbides, and chalcogenides are attractive materials because of their
unique physical and chemical properties.1−7 Transition metal oxide nanosheets are applied for catalysis,8−10 gas sensing,11,12 and energy storage applications.13−15 They can be synthesized using different methods including liquid
exfoliation,16,17 hydrothermal synthesis,18 chemical and physical vapor depositions,13,19 salt-template,20 and others.21−23 Among these approaches, liquid exfoliation of bulk metal oxides
is the most common technique to fabricate transition metal oxide nanosheets.16,17 However, liquid exfoliation usually involves the use of organic
solvents, which is environmentally unfriendly and leads to undesirable
wastes. Thus, large efforts have been focused on the development of
environmentally friendly approaches.21,22,24

Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is a
superior semiconducting
material25,26 which can be used in several applications,
such as batteries,27 supercapacitors,28 gas sensors,29 field
effect transistors,30 and catalysis.31−33 In addition, MoO3 is a polymorph material with at least
four known phases [orthorhombic (α-MoO3),34 monoclinic (β-MoO3),35 hexagonal (h-MoO3),36 and high pressure monoclinic (MoO3-II)].37 Among them, α-MoO3 has been
extensively studied because of its outstanding electrochemical and
catalytic activities.38,39 So far, a variety of α-MoO3 nanostructures were synthesized including nanoparticles,40,41 nanobelts,9,11 flower-like hierarchical structures,36 nanoflakes,30,42−45 and nanosheets.10,28,46−48 MoO3 nanosheets can be prepared using
hydrothermal synthesis,47 salt-templated
approach,20 and milling or sonication of
bulk α-MoO3 powder mixed with organic solvents (e.g., N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, ethanol, and isopropanol).30,33,43 However, these methods include
several steps,29 produce undesirable organic
wastes, and require a high temperature.20

Organic dyes are widely used in industries, especially in
textile
manufacturing; however, they are considered as environmental threats.49 Water treatment approaches, such as adsorption,50 photocatalysis,51 or others,52,53 were reported for the treatment
of dyes in waste water. Several materials, including zeolitic imidazolate
frameworks (ZIF-8),54 Degussa TiO2 (P25), and ZnO,55 were reported as photocatalysts
for dye degradation, decolorization, or encapsulation.56 One interesting property of α-MoO3 is being a semiconducting layered material, with a tunable
band gap depending on the intercalating ions between layers.57 Therefore, it can be used as a photocatalyst
for dye degradation.32,58−62 MoO3–x nanosheets
are efficient photocatalysts for dye degradation/decolorization because
of their high aspect ratio and the presence of oxygen vacancies.32,58−62 Furthermore, they can generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) upon dispersion in water which causes degradation of organic
dyes.36

In this paper, we report
the synthesis of MoO3–x nanosheets
using a one-step water-based exfoliation
technique. The method provides a cheap and environmentally friendly
strategy for fabricating MoO3–x nanosheets with a reasonable yield. The nanosheets show a near infrared
(NIR) plasmonic property that was mediated using visible light irradiation.
The nanosheets were applied as a photocatalyst for decolorization
of organic dyes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis, Structural Properties, and Chemical
Composition of MoO3–x Nanosheets
The bulk α-MoO3 possesses a tunable layered structure
with an orthorhombic unit cell.38 Water
molecules have an affinity to intercalate into the MoO3 layers,63 which results in an expansion
of the interlayer distances and thus weakens the bonds holding the
α-MoO3 layers together. Consequently, the reflux
of bulk α-MoO3 in water at an elevated temperature
can lead to its exfoliation into the nanosheets. The exfoliation process
is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. In a typical experiment, bulk α-MoO3 was dispersed in deionized water to form a white suspension, which
was then refluxed at 80 °C for 5–7 days. At the end of
the reflux, the suspension color changes to yellow because of the
formation of MoO3–x nanosheets.
The exfoliated nanosheets can be separated from the remaining bulk
material by centrifugation at a high speed (10 000 rpm). The
bulk material was decanted as a white precipitate, whereas the MoO3–x nanosheets remain dispersed in
the mother liquor, which has a faint yellow color and form green strips
of MoO3–x nanosheets upon drying
in air at 80 °C for 2–5 h (Figure S1c). The yield of MoO3–x nanosheets varied from 17 to 60% depending on the reflux temperature
and the concentration of the starting bulk material. The yield increases
with the increase of reflux temperature but decreases with the concentration
of the starting material.

Scheme 1 Schematic Presentation for the Exfoliation
Process of Bulk α-MoO3 to MoO3–x Nanosheets
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the exfoliated
MoO3–x nanosheets show a poor crystallinity
(Figure 1a). However,
the resolved XRD peaks suggest that the exfoliated nanosheets are
composed of both orthorhombic α-MoO3 and hydrated
MoO3 (h-MoO3). Interestingly, the exfoliation
of α-MoO3 occurs readily, even under dark conditions
(via covering the reaction vessel with an aluminum foil), which reveals
that the visible light is not playing a significant role in the exfoliation
process (Figure 1a).
In the following sections, MoO3–x nanosheets were synthesized via refluxing at 80 °C for 7 days
under natural light.

Figure 1 Structural properties and chemical composition of MoO3–x nanosheets: (a) XRD patterns of
exfoliated MoO3–x nanosheets using
0.45 (in dark
conditions), 0.90, and 1.80 g of bulk α-MoO3 and
standard patterns for h-MoO3 and α-MoO3. (b) Raman spectra of exfoliated MoO3–x nanosheets, bulk α-MoO3, and bulk MoO2. (c,d) XPS spectra of Mo 3d and O 1s core levels of MoO3–x nanosheets, respectively.

Raman spectrum of the MoO3–x nanosheets shows broad and low
intense peaks compared to the bulk
α-MoO3 (Figure 1b). The sharp Raman peaks associated with α-MoO3 at 283, 290, 336, 666, 820, and 994 cm–1 became less intense,8,30,43,64 and the extra peaks at Raman shifts of 244,
370, 480, 865, and 962 cm–1 refer to MoO3–x,30,42,64 suggesting the creation of oxygen vacancies in the exfoliated nanosheets.
Although the ratio of peak intensities at 283 and 290 cm–1 (I283/I290) can be used to estimate the amount of oxygen vacancies,64 unfortunately, the Raman spectrum of MoO3–x nanosheets is not well-resolved
and thus it is difficult to make such an estimation.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was employed to
investigate the oxidation states and the presence of oxygen vacancies
in the MoO3–x nanosheets. The Mo
3d spectrum in Figure 1c displays a couple of peaks at 233.0 and 236.1 eV, which refer to
the binding energies of Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2, respectively. The energy gap between the
two doublets is approximately 3.1 eV, which is consistent with the
previous report.65 The O 1s spectrum shows
a broad asymmetric peak, which can be deconvoluted into three peaks,
as shown in Figure 1d. The main peak (red curve) at 530.9 eV can be assigned as O2–. This value is slightly lower than that reported
for commercial α-MoO3 (531.3 eV),8 suggesting a change in the coordination environment between
O and Mo atoms in the MoO3–x nanosheets.
In previous reports, the shift of the O 1s peak to a lower binding
energy was attributed to the transfer of electrons to the oxygen vacancies.8,66 The peak at 531.7 eV (blue curve) can be assigned as the surface-adsorbed
species (OH–, O–, or oxygen vacancies).8,67,68 Finally, the peak at 532.8 eV
(orange curve) can be assigned to adsorbed water.8,67,68

2.2 Chemical Bonding, Photochemical
Properties,
and Morphology of MoO3–x Nanosheets
The chemical bonds in MoO3–x nanosheets and bulk α-MoO3 were compared using
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The bulk α-MoO3 displays peaks at the wavenumbers of 434, 532, 810, 840, and 976
cm–1, whereas the MoO3–x nanosheets show peaks at wavenumbers of 532, 654, 615, 810,
864, 960, 1600, and 3400 cm–1 (Figure 2a). The complete assignment
of all peaks is described in Note S1 (see Supporting Information). The vibrational peaks between 1000 and 900 cm–1 refer to Mo=O bond characteristic stretching
vibrations.36 The small shift between bulk
α-MoO3 (976 cm–1) and MoO3–x nanosheets (960 cm–1) shows that
the local structure surrounding the Mo core is different because of
the oxygen vacancies of the nanosheets. Therefore, the FTIR spectra
prove that the chemical bonding and local structure environment of
the MoO3–x nanosheets are different
from those of the bulk α-MoO3, which confirms the
successful exfoliation of the bulk MoO3.

photochemical properties of MoO3–x nanosheets: (a) FTIR spectra of the exfoliated MoO3–x nanosheets and bulk α-MoO3. (b)
UV–vis absorbance and (c) NIR absorbance of the
MoO3–x nanosheet aqueous solution
under visible light irradiation for a given interval. (d) Variation
of the NIR plasmonic peak absorbance at the wavelengths of 1160 and
954 nm over the time.

The UV–vis spectrum for MoO3–x nanosheets shows absorbance in the range of 320–800
nm, with a broad absorption peak at a wavelength of 320 nm (see Figure S1a). The absorbance in the visible range
(400–800 nm) is attributed to the existence of d electrons
arising from the intervalence charge transfer between Mo5+ and Mo6+,69 which explains
the turquoise (bluish-green) color of the MoO3–x aqueous suspension compared to the white color of
the bulk α-MoO3 suspension (see Figure S1b). The electron charge transfer can be further activated
by solar light irradiation.43−45 To investigate the effect of
light irradiation on MoO3–x nanosheets,
we recorded the UV–vis–NIR absorbance of MoO3–x under visible light irradiation (Figure 2b–d). The absorbance
in the range of 500–800 nm shows a decrease in the peak intensity
over the time (0–60 min). Furthermore, a couple of new weak
absorption peaks emerged at the wavelengths of 954 and 1160 nm (Figure 2c). These two peaks
refer to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of MoO3–x nanosheets.30,43−45 The intensity of the two peaks increases with time
and reaches its maximum after ∼10 min. The increase in the
intensity of the NIR plasmonic peaks is due to the excitation caused
by light irradiation which increases the free carrier density.69 Thus, visible light irradiation causes a dramatic
effect on the photochemical properties of MoO3–x nanosheets. It is worth noting that the UV–vis–NIR
spectra backgrounds decrease with time (see Figure 2b,c). If the spectra backgrounds were removed,
there will be no dramatic change in the plasmonic peak intensities
after 10 min of light irradiation.

Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) revealed that
the exfoliated MoO3–x and bulk
α-MoO3 possess different morphologies. The bulk α-MoO3 has a plate-like morphology (Figure 3a), whereas the exfoliated MoO3–x is composed of fine nanosheets with a few nanometer
thickness (Figure 2b,c). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) further confirmed the uniform nanosheet morphology (Figure 3d,e). The AFM height
profile for the MoO3–x nanosheets
showed that the nanosheet thickness is about 10 nm (Figure 3f). Furthermore, the aqueous
suspension of MoO3–x showed Tyndall
effect (inset Figure 3c), which reflects the colloidal nature of the suspension and indicates
the formation of homogeneous and stable MoO3–x nanosheets.

2.3 Photocatalytic Activity of Bulk α-MoO3 Versus MoO3–x Nanosheets
for Organic Dye Decolorization
The photocatalytic decolorization/degradation
process of Rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) using bulk α-MoO3 or MoO3–x nanosheets was
carried out under visible light irradiation with stirring. The decolorization
process was tracked via recording the UV–vis absorption at
a given reaction time. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the
pure dye solution under visible light irradiation displayed insignificant
changes over the time (Figures 4a and 5a). The absorption maxima at
550 and 515 nm for RhB (Figure 4a) or at 665 and 605 nm for MB (Figure 5a) refer to the monomeric (0–0 band)
and dimeric (0–1 band) forms of the corresponding dye. Notably,
the intensities of the absorption peaks of the investigated dye (RhB
or MB) decreased in the presence of bulk α-MoO3 (Figures 4b and 5b) or MoO3–x nanosheets
(Figures 4c and 5c), which indicates the photodegradation of the
corresponding dye. Furthermore, in the presence of MoO3–x nanosheets, the shape of the absorption peaks changed
after the direct addition of the nanosheets to the investigated dye
(see the red curves in Figures 4c and 5c). This observation indicates
that the reaction is fast. As reported in previous investigations
using h-MoO336 or α-MnO2/h-MoO3 hybrid material,32 the dye degradation can be attributed to the strong chemisorption
between the MoO3–x nanosheets and
the dye, in addition to the formation of reactive radical species
such as OH• and O2•–. The peak broadening upon a photocatalytic reaction with MoO3–x nanosheets indicates the change
of the chromophoric group of the dye under investigation. To the best
of our knowledge, this observation is reported for the first time.
Taking into account of the low surface areas of bulk MoO3 and MoO3–x (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
and Langmuir surface areas are 4 and 6 m2/g for bulk MoO3 and 2 and 3 m2/g for MoO3–x, respectively, Figure S2), the reactive radical species play a leading role for dye degradation.
The color changes of RhB dye were also monitored using naked eye,
as shown in Figure S3.

plots for RhB photocatalytic degradation:
(a) RhB without the catalyst, (b) RhB with bulk α-MoO3, (c) RhB with MoO3–x nanosheets,
and (d) variation of the removal efficiency of RhB in the presence
of the catalyst (α-MoO3 or MoO3–x nanosheets) over the time.

(a) MB without catalyst (b) MB with bulk α-MoO3,
(c) MB with MoO3–x nanosheets,
and (d) variation of the removal efficiency of MB in the presence
of the catalyst (α-MoO3 or MoO3–x nanosheets) over the time.

Generally speaking, there are many pathways for dye photodegradation,
such as “step-by-step N-dealkylation” and “cycloreversion”
(cleavage of the whole chromophore structure).70,71 The former pathway usually shows a shift in the absorption maximum,
whereas the latter pathway does not make a shift in the absorption
maximum but it causes a decrease in the absorption intensity.70,71 On the basis of the recorded UV–vis absorption spectra (Figures 4 and 5), both pathways were observed for MoO3–x nanosheets, whereas the bulk α-MoO3 showed only a cycloreversion pathway. It is worth mentioning that
we observed 10% degradation for RhB under dark conditions (no light)
using MoO3–x nanosheets as the
catalyst (Figure S4). This observation
agrees well with previous report, which showed the degradation of
the organic dye in the absence of light using h-MoO3.36 This phenomenon was attributed to the in situ
generation of H2O2, which is the major oxidizing
agent for dye degradation under dark conditions.36

The degradation products of the investigated dyes
were probed using
FTIR (Figure 6) and
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Figure S5). The FTIR spectra after photocatalytic reactions
show the presence of O–H or N–H band (3300–3500
cm–1) and a strong peak of C–O (1050–1150
cm–1), which confirms the degradation of the investigated
dyes. In addition, the change of C=O (1715 cm–1) peak shape for RhB approves its degradation.54 Notably, the ESI-MS spectra of MB after photocatalysis
using bulk α-MoO3 or MoO3–x (Figure S5) show almost the absence
of the dye molecular weight at 284 m/z and formation of other species with high and low molecular weights.72 Interestingly, in the case of photocatalysis
using MoO3–x nanosheets, several
peaks of low molecular weights were observed, which confirm the dye
degradation (Figure S5d). Some of these
peaks are shown in Scheme S1.

Figure 6 Probing degradation
product by FTIR: (a) FTIR spectra of RhB and
(b) MB before and after photocatalysis. The highlighted peaks show
the change of the dye function groups.

A comparison between photocatalysis using MoO3–x nanosheets and other materials for dye degradation
is tabulated in Table 1. Under UV irradiation, h-MoO336 and ZIF-854 show degradation efficiencies
of about 71.0 and 82.3%, respectively, for MB. However, MoO3–x nanosheets under visible light irradiation result
in the disappearance of the characteristic absorption peak(s) of the
investigated dye after 10 min. One can see from Table 1 that the photocatalysis using MoO3–x nanosheets has several advantages, such as (1) the
use of a low-energy source (150 W), (2) the reaction occurs at room
temperature, (3) the use of a low amount of catalyst, and (4) offering
photocatalysis for a concentrated dye solution without losing the
free radicals generated by MoO3–x.65 Furthermore, there is no dramatic
change in the material crystallinity after catalysis (Figure S6). Therefore, MoO3–x nanosheets are considered as an efficient photocatalyst
and can be used for further applications including water treatment
using membrane-based technologies.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we introduced a novel environmentally
friendly exfoliation
strategy to fabricate MoO3–x nanosheets
from commercially available bulk α-MoO3. FE-SEM,
TEM, and AFM indicated that MoO3–x possesses a nanosheet morphology with a thickness of about 10 nm.
XRD, XPS, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of
MoO3–x nanosheets. Visible light
irradiation for the aqueous suspension of MoO3–x nanosheets mediated LSPR peaks at 954 and 1160 nm,
suggesting the creation of more oxygen vacancies upon light excitation,
which increases the free carrier density. The MoO3–x nanosheets displayed a satisfactory performance
in dye decolorization under visible light irradiation for a short
time (10 min). FTIR and ESI-MS confirmed the degradation of RhB and
MB dyes after visible light photocatalysis in the presence of MoO3–x nanosheets. The nanosheet morphology
of MoO3–x offers the potential
for membrane technology and opens a new venue for the removal of dyes
from waste water.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Material and Methods
Bulk α-MoO3 was
purchased from Alfa Aesar (Germany). RhB and MB were
purchased from Sigma (Germany) and Fluka (India), respectively. All
chemicals were used as purchased without any purification.

4.2 Synthesis of MoO3–x Nanosheets
In a typical synthesis, a given amount
(1.80, 0.90, or 0.45 g) of bulk α-MoO3 was refluxed
in 200 mL of deionized water (DIW) for 5–7 days at 25–80
°C. The resulting suspension was then centrifuged at a speed
of 10 000 rpm for 5 min. The unexfoliated MoO3 crystals
were decanted from the dispersion of exfoliated MoO3–x nanosheets. The faint yellow supernatant was collected
and dried at 80 °C for 5–8 h to form green strips of MoO3–x nanosheets.

4.3 Characterization
Techniques
PXRD
was performed in the 2θ range of 4°–60° using
a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with a pixel
detector and Cu Kα1 radiation (wavelength, 1.5406
Å). FTIR spectra were recorded by attenuated total reflectance
FTIR (ATR-FTIR, UK, Varian 610-IR) in the wavenumber range of 4000–400
cm–1. Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM
HR 800 Raman instrument with an 800 mm focal length spectrograph and
wavelength of 786 nm. The XPS measurement was performed using AXIS
Ultra (Kratos Analytical Ltd.) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.7 eV), and the binding
energies were normalized to the C 1s peaks of (C–C) and (C–H)
bonds (284.8 eV). The material morphology was observed using FE-SEM
(JEOL, JSM-7401) and TEM (JEOL, JEM 2100, accelerating voltage 200
kV). The thickness of the nanosheets was determined by AFM (Bruker
Nanoscope III in the tapping mode). The UV–vis–NIR measurements
were acquired using a PerkinElmer Lambda 19 UV–vis–NIR
spectrometer. ESI-MS was performed using Bruker solariX XR FTMS in
the positive mode. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained at
77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Before the measurements,
the samples were degassed under a reduced pressure (<10 Pa) at
100 °C for 3 h.

4.4 Visible Light Activation
of MoO3–x Nanosheets
The
aqueous suspension of MoO3–x nanosheets
(10 mL, 8 g/L) was irradiated
with visible light (Halolux Ceram Eco 150W) under ambient temperature.
The UV–vis–NIR absorption of the suspension was recorded
in the wavelength range of 200–1300 nm.

4.5 Photocatalytic
Decolorization of Organic Dyes
The photocatalytic activity
of MoO3–x nanosheets was evaluated
using RhB and MB as models. In a
typical experiment, 1 mL of the dye stock solution (1 g/L) was diluted
to 20 mL, and then 1 mL of the catalyst suspension (bulk α-MoO3 or MoO3–x nanosheets)
with a concentration of 8 g/L was added. The reaction mixture was
stirred under ambient temperature and then irradiated with visible
light (Halolux Ceram Eco 150W, the distance between the reaction vials
and the light source was ∼25 cm). After a given reaction time,
a sample of 0.1 mL from the reaction mixture was diluted to 4 mL by
DIW, and then its UV–vis absorption spectrum was recorded in
the range between 300 and 800 nm. The removal efficiency of the dye
was estimated according to the following equation (eq 1) 1  where A0 is the
initial absorbance of the dye before mixing with the catalyst and At is the absorbance of the
dye at a given reaction time t (min).

The effect
of direct addition of the catalyst on dye decolorization was measured
by adding 50 μL of MoO3 or MoO3–x (8 g/L) to 4 mL of the solution containing 100 μL
of the dye (1 g/L).
