A 3.1%
Ru/UiO-66 material was prepared by adsorption of RuCl3 from
ethyl acetate on to MOF UiO-66, followed by reduction
with NaBH4. The presence of acid–base and ox-red
sites allows this 3.1% Ru/UiO-66 material acting as a bifunctional
catalyst for the reduction of nitroarenes and tandem reaction of alcohol
oxidation/Knoevenagel condensation. The high efficiency of 3.1% Ru/UiO-66
was demonstrated in the reduction of nitroarenes to amines. This system
can be applied as a catalyst for at least six successive cycles without
loss of activity. The 3.1% Ru/UiO-66 catalyst also was active in the
tandem aerobic oxidation of alcohols/Knoevenagel condensation with
malononitrile. However, the activity of this catalyst strongly decreased
in the second cycle. A combination of physicochemical and catalytic
experimental data indicated that Ru nanoparticles are the active sites
both for the catalytic reduction of nitro compounds and the aerobic
oxidation of alcohols. The activity for the Knoevenagel condensation
reaction was from the existence of the “Zrn+–O2– Lewis acid–base”
pair in the framework of UiO-66.

1 Introduction
Metal
organic frameworks (MOFs), being the porous and crystalline
coordination polymers formed from the coordination of metal ions or
clusters and chelating ligands, have attracted considerable attention
in many fields, such as drug delivery systems, sensor, gas storage,
as well as separation, electrochemistry, and catalysis, due to their
large surface area, high adjustability of metal nodes, and organic
ligands.1−19 In addition, the highly well-organized nanometer-sized nanocages
in MOFs allow them to be possible as ideal platforms to anchor metal
nanoparticles.20,21 However, most MOFs have the weakness
of rather low thermal, hydrothermal, and chemical stabilities compared
to those of zeolites, which will undoubtedly limit their applications
on a large scale. Fortunately, a zirconium-based MOF (UiO-66) was
confirmed with the character of either large surface area or very
high thermal stability.22 The UiO-66, resulting
from the alternating combination of hexanuclear zirconium clusters
with bridging ligand 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, provides a robust,
three-dimensional porous structure. It possesses a decomposition temperature
above 500 °C and can tolerate many chemicals and water.23 In addition, there are some hydroxyl groups
on the surfaces of hexanuclear zirconium clusters helping the anchoring
of other transition metals. Therefore, UiO-66 can be regarded as an
ideal support for developing heterogeneous catalysts with special
performance.

Up till now many transition metals, such as Pt,
Au, Pd, V, and
Ti, have been successfully introduced into UiO-66 or its derivatives
by the postsynthetic method to obtain catalysts in various catalytic
reactions.20,24−35 For example, Pt nanoparticles were successfully confined inside
the cavities of amine-functionalized UiO-66 (UiO-66-NH2), forming a catalyst for selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde,
exhibiting high activity and selectivity toward cinnamyl alcohol;24 Au nanoparticles encapsulated in UiO-66 showed
excellent catalytic performance and good reusability for the aerobic
oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under solvent-free conditions.36 The nanopalladium particles, respectively, supported
on UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 were used in the catalytic hydrogenation
of phenol in aqueous media.33 Interestingly,
Pd–UiO-66 gave higher selectivity toward cyclohexanol but Pd–UiO-66-NH2 showed higher selectivity toward cyclohexanone under the
same conditions. Because of the multifunctional catalysis of ruthenium,
more attention has been paid to the deposition of ruthenium onto UiO-66
and its derivatives. Ru nanoparticles supported on UiO-66 showed good
performance in various reactions, such as the selective hydrogenation
of furfural to furfuryl alcohol under mild conditions37 and the methanation of CO2 in high yield.38 Ru nanoparticle deposition onto sulfonic acid-functionalized
UiO-66 (UiO-66-SO3H) exhibited dual-functional catalysis,
converting biomass-derived methyl levulinate into g-valerolactone
efficiently under the mild conditions of 80 °C and 0.5 MPa H2.39

On the other hand, neat
MOFs including UiO-66 have also been used
as solid catalysts for various condensation reactions due to the metallic
nodes acting as Lewis acid sites.40 Therefore,
the deposition of metal nanoparticles onto MOFs is expected to provide
multifunctional catalysts for one-pot cascade reactions. Generally,
one-pot cascade reactions can improve efficiency compared to multistep
synthetic processes.41−43

More recently, reduction of nitro compounds
with formic acid or
its salts as hydrogen source has drawn increasing attention.44−47 Formic acid as hydrogen source has the advantages of safety, nontoxicity,
and easiness of transportation and storage compared with hydrogen.
In addition, formic acid is a major byproduct in the conversion of
biomass into value-added products. Therefore, the reduction of nitro
compounds to amines with formic acid is more efficient and environmentally
friendly than the traditional ways. Up till now, several catalysts
from the immobilization of noble metals Pt and Pd on various supports
have been developed and have showed excellent performance in the hydrogenation
of nitroarenes to anilines with formic acid as hydrogen source.44−47 However, no report has been observed for the reduction of nitro
compounds to amines with formic acid activated by Ru nanoparticles
deposited onto MOFs. Furthermore, the immobilized Ru nanoparticles
can be transformed to different active species under reduction and
oxidation conditions due to the presence of Run+/Run+2 ionic pair, which is expected
to be active both in reduction and oxidation reactions as a catalyst.

In this work, a 3.1% Ru/UiO-66 material was prepared from the deposition
of Ru nanoparticles onto UiO-66. This material as a catalyst showed
good performances for the reduction of nitro compounds with formic
acid to amines and one-pot tandem aerobic oxidation/Knoevenagel condensation
reaction of various alcohols with malononitrile.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of UiO-66–Ru
UiO-66
was employed as the host matrix to embed Ru nanoparticles due to its
high physicochemical stability, resistance to water and various organic
solvents, and large surface area. In the beginning, UiO-66 was synthesized
according to the reported method.26 Characterization
results confirmed that the structure of the as-synthesized material
is in agreement with that of UiO-66. We envisioned the deposition
of Ru nanoparticles onto UiO-66 similar to the immobilization of other
metal nanoparticles on UiO-66 or UiO-67.26,27,48 A precursor named as UiO-66–RuCl3 was first synthesized from the reaction of RuCl3 with the hydroxy groups on the Zr node of UiO-66. The stability
of RuCl3 and UiO-66–RuCl3 in solvent
is of great importance to ensure the adsorption of RuCl3 onto UiO-66. Several solvents, including ethyl acetate, methanol,
water, and 0.2 N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid were tested
in the preparation of UiO-66–RuCl3. Except ethyl
acetate, the other solvents led to part decomposition of RuCl3 or UiO-66–RuCl3, as shown in Figure 1a. Therefore, the adsorption
of RuCl3 onto UiO-66 was conducted in ethyl acetate. The
formed UiO-66–RuCl3 was extracted with ethyl acetate
in Soxhlet extractor to remove the free RuCl3 on the surface
of the framework. Then, the UiO-66–RuCl3 was reduced
with NaBH4 in water, from which Ru3+ was reduced
to Ru0, leading to embedment of Ru nanoparticles onto UiO-66
to give UiO-66–Ru. Upon the formation of UiO-66–Ru,
it was stable in all of the tested solvents (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 Stability test in several solvents: UiO-66–RuCl3 (a), UiO-66–Ru (b).

2.2 Characterization of Catalysts
The
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of UiO-66, UiO-66–RuCl3, and UiO-66–Ru are shown in Figure 2. The XRD patterns of UiO-66 are matched
well with the simulated XRD patterns. Specific characteristic diffraction
peaks of UiO-66 structure (Figure 2) are same as those reported in the literature.23,49 The XRD patterns of UiO-66–RuCl3 and UiO-66–Ru
are consistent with those of UiO-66, manifesting maintenance of the
frame structure of UiO-66 after embedment of Ru species. For all of
the samples loaded with Ru species, no characteristic peaks of Ru
are observed in their XRD patterns, which indicates that ruthenium
species are well dispersed and/or the content of loaded Ru is too
low to generate a large cluster to give diffraction signals.37,50

Figure 2 XRD
patterns of the samples.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM), and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) images of the samples are shown in Figure 3. Both the TEM and STEM images
revealed that the neat UiO-66 exhibits octahedral morphology and the
surfaces of the crystals are very smooth (Figure 3a,d). After the loading of Ru species, both
UiO-66–RuCl3 and UiO-66–Ru remain in octahedral
morphology (Figure 3b,c,e f). The surfaces of the crystals of UiO-66–RuCl3 are still smooth, indicating the uniform dispersion of RuCl3 (Figure 3b,e).
However, some small nanoparticles are clearly observed on the surfaces
of the crystals of UiO-66–Ru similar to the case of UiO-66–Pt
in the literature51 (Figure 3c,f), indicating the depositing of Ru species
on the surface of UiO-66. The HRTEM images (Figure 3g–i) of the fresh and used samples
clearly show Ru particles are well dispersed on the surface of the
UiO-66. Figure 3j–l
provides the mean Ru particle sizes of the samples of fresh, used
UiO-66–Ru in reduction (red.) and used in oxidation (oxi.),
which are 1.07, 1.27, and 1.56 nm, respectively. The Ru particle sizes
in the used UiO-66–Ru are larger than of those in the fresh
one, indicating Ru particle aggregation taking place during the catalytic
run, especially in the case of oxidation reaction.

distributions of the fresh UiO-66–Ru (g, j), used UiO-66–Ru
(red.) (h, k), and used UiO-66–Ru (oxi.) (i, l).

In addition, the energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDS) element mappings
of UiO-66–Ru (Figure 4) disclosed the coexistence of zirconium, ruthenium, carbon,
and oxygen. The element mappings of UiO-66–Ru revealed that
four elements are uniformly distributed throughout the octahedral
crystal.

Figure 4 EDS-mapping analysis of UiO-66–Ru.

Figure 5 shows
the
SEM images of the fresh and used samples of UiO-66–Ru. The
images show that the morphologies of all of the samples are composed
of octahedral crystals with different dimensions. No big difference
was observed between the fresh and used samples either in nitrobenzene
reduction or alcohol oxidation, which indicated that the framework
of UiO-66–Ru was stable during the catalytic applications.

Figure 5 SEM images
of UiO-66–Ru: fresh UiO-66–Ru (a), used
UiO-66–Ru (red.) (b), and used UiO-66–Ru (oxi.) (c).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was carried out
to determine the ruthenium species and their relative contents in
the fresh and used samples of UiO-66–Ru. The XPS wide scan
spectra of the samples exhibit distinct C 1s, O 1s, Ru 3p and 3d,
and Zr 3d peaks (Figure S1). The fitted
Ru 3d spectra are shown in Figure 6. Deconvolution of the Ru 3d profile of the fresh UiO-66–Ru
revealed three binding energy peaks located at 280.3, 281.2, and 282.9
eV (Table 1), which
could be ascribed to Ru0, RuO2, and RuO2·xH2O, respectively.37,52 The Ru 3d profile was used to reveal the changes of the three species
and their relative contents in the used samples. As shown in Table 1, both the binding
energies of RuO2 and RuO2·xH2O of the used samples changed in reasonable intervals
compared to those of the fresh one. The contents of the three species
of the sample after use in the reduction of nitrobenzene are almost
same as those of the fresh sample. For the sample after use in the
oxidation of alcohol, the content of Ru0 decreased by 7%,
whereas the content of RuO2 increased by 7%, indicating
the transformation of some surface Ru0 into RuO2 under aerobic oxidation conditions.

used UiO-66–Ru (oxi.)	280.3/42	281.4/39	282.8/19	182.3	184.5	
In addition, the binding energies of Zr 3d5/2 and Zr
3d3/2 of UiO-66–Ru remained constant before and
after the catalytic reactions (Table 1, Figure 6), indicating the stability of UiO-66 as a support to embed ruthenium
nanoparticles.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
of the samples
of UiO-66, UiO-66–RuCl3, and UiO-66–Ru were
measured at 77 K, from which the specific surface areas and texture
porosities of the samples were obtained. As shown in Figure 7, all of the samples exhibited
typical type I isotherms, indicating the microporous nature of the
samples.53 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of UiO-66, UiO-66–RuCl3, and
UiO-66–Ru are 1276, 789, and 876 m2/g, corresponding
to pore volumes of 0.53, 0.34, and 0.39 cm3/g, respectively.
The small BET surface areas and the pore volumes of UiO-66–RuCl3 and UiO-66–Ru compared to those of UiO-66 also indicated
the deposition of Ru species onto the framework of UiO-66,20,39,50 which is in accordance with the
TEM characterization result. The bigger surface area and pore volume
of UiO-66–Ru than those of UiO-66–RuCl3 is
due to the reduction of RuCl3 to Ru0, leading
to removal of Cl– from the cavities of UiO-66.

and UiO-66–RuCl3.

Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out to study
the
thermal stability of UiO-66 and UiO-66–Ru. As shown in Figure 8, both UiO-66 and
UiO-66–Ru show three weight-loss stages. The initial weight-loss
stage occurring in the temperature range of 25–100 °C
is due to desorption of physisorbed water, whereas the second weight-loss
stage observed in the temperature range of 100–500 °C
is related to the removal of dimethylformamide (DMF) and the dehydroxylation
of the zirconium oxo-clusters.53,54 The third weight-loss
stage starting at 500 °C is attributed to the decomposition of
UiO-66 as a result of the burning of organic-linker molecules in the
framework. The results revealed that UiO-66–Ru is thermally
stable below 500 °C.

2.3 Catalytic
Hydrogenation of Nitro Compound
Amines are important intermediates
or precursors in the manufacture
of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, pigments, and polymers.55,56 Generally, amines are manufactured by catalytic hydrogenation of
nitro compounds. Recently, formic acid as hydrogen source has been
successfully applied to the hydrogenation of nitro compounds to amines,44−47,50 which is safe and environmentally
friendly compared with the traditional ways. So we applied UiO-66–Ru
to the reduction of nitro compounds to amines, with formic acid as
hydrogen source. First, the catalytic performance of UiO-66–Ru
was evaluated for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline as
a model reaction. Initially, the reaction was conducted in a mixture
of H2O and 2-propanol (1:9) at room temperature, as described
in the literature.44−47 However, no reaction was observed in this case. With increasing
temperature, the reaction took place and was improved gradually (Table 2, entries 4, 7, 8).
When the temperature was increased to 150 °C, nitrobenzene was
almost quantitatively converted to aniline at 1.0 mol % of catalyst
loading in 3 h (Table 2, entry 4). As a control experiment, almost no aniline was obtained
in the absence of UiO-66–Ru. Replacing UiO-66–Ru with
UiO-66 or RuCl3 as catalyst led to very poor results (Table 2, entries 2, 3). Decreasing
UiO-66–Ru loading from 1 to 0.5 mol % led to a big decrease
of selectivity of aniline from 99 to 42.8%, although the conversion
of nitrobenzene was maintained (Table 2, entries 4, 5). The reaction was also conducted in
different solvents. Both the conversion and selectivity decreased
sharply when the reaction was run in neat 2-propanol (Table 2, entry 9). Excessive increase
of water in 2-propanol also led to a sharp decrease of conversion
of nitrobenzene (Table 2, entry 10). The other proton polar solvents, ethanol and H2O–methanol mixture, afforded high conversion of nitrobenzene
but low selectivity of aniline (Table 2, entries 11, 12). High conversion of nitrobenzene
and selectivity of aniline were received in toluene but were still
inferior to those in H2O/2-propanol (1:9). These results
could be ascribed to the fact that the addition of a certain amount
of water can greatly improve the conversion rate and selectivity,
probably because water can promote the decomposition of formic acid
into H+ and HCOO–.46 Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
analysis showed that the major byproduct was unconverted nitrosobenzene
and hydroxylamine intermediate in other reaction solvents.46 It is worth noting that the best results were
received in H2O/2-propanol (1:9) mixture. The volume ratio
of 1:9 in the H2O/2-propanol mixture is close to the azeotropic
composition of 2-propanol and water, which allows easy recycling of
the solvent in large practice. The loading amount of formic acid was
also screened, and the optimal molar ratio of formic acid to substrate
was 5:1 (Table S1).

According to the above results in combination with the results

ratio of formic acid to nitrobenzene of 5:1, 2-PrOH/H2O
(9/1) 3 mL, and reaction temperature 150 °C.

A filtration
test was carried out to evaluate the heterogeneity
of the hydrogenation of nitro compounds to amines catalyzed by UiO-66–Ru,
with nitrobenzene as the substrate. After 1 h of reaction, the UiO-66–Ru
was removed by centrifugation and the liquid phase was stirred further
under identical conditions for 2 h. As shown in Figure 9, the conversion remained constant throughout
the process, which indicated that no active species leaking took place
and UiO-66–Ru belongs to a heterogeneous catalyst.

Figure 9 Filtration
test for the reduction of nitrobenzene over UiO-66–Ru.

To evaluate the versatility of
this catalytic hydrogenation system,
the reduction of various nitro compounds were explored under the optimized
conditions. As shown in Table 3, various substituted nitrobenzenes with both electron-withdrawing
and electron-donating groups were selectively converted to the corresponding
anilines in excellent yields. The time to finish the reaction changed
with the substituents, but no regularity was observed from the viewpoint
of electronic effect (Table 3, entries 2, 5–7, 9). The position of the substituent
related to the nitro group has some effects on the reaction. The substrate
with an o-substituent gave lower selectivity and isolated yield than
that with a para- or meta-substituent due to the steric hindrance
(Table 3, entries 2–4).
Large substituent generally gave low yield compared with small substituent
of the same kind (Table 3, entries 5–7 and 9). Delightedly, no dehalogenation was detected
in the cases of various halogenated nitrobenzenes as substrates, which
generally occurred in the catalytic hydrogenation of halogenated nitro
compounds. Similar to the catalyst from deposition of Pd nanoparticles
onto UiO-66,44 UiO-66–Ru showed
high activity and selectivity in the reduction of substrates with
ketone and carboxyl groups (Table 3, entries 10, 11). Besides, nitronaphthalene was almost
quantitatively converted to aminonaphthalene (Table 3, entry 12). However, it failed in the reduction
of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (Table 3, entry 13). Some oligomers rather than the
target product were obtained, which might be due to the condensation
of formyl group with amines at 150 °C. The catalyst also failed
in the reduction of nitrocyclohexane, being a representative of aliphatic
nitro compounds. An oily mixture of unidentified compounds was obtained
in this case (Table 3, entry 14).

2.4 Catalytic Alcohol Oxidation/Knoevenagel
Condensation
Reaction
Tandem reactions, which combine two or more synthetic
steps in one pot, are attractive and practical tools in organic synthesis.
Compared to the corresponding multistep synthetic processes, they
have the advantages of avoiding isolation of intermediates, reducing
production of wastes, and easily available starting materials.57,58 It is known that supported Ru nanoparticles are efficient catalysts
for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols59−62 and UiO-66 is active in the Knoevenagel
condensation reaction due to the existence of the “Zrn+–O2– Lewis acid–base”
pair in its framework.63 Therefore, the
UiO-66–Ru was also evaluated in the one-pot tandem aerobic
alcohol oxidation/Knoevenagel condensation reaction. First, we examine
the catalysis of UiO-66–Ru on the aerobic oxidation of alcohols
with benzyl alcohol as a model substrate under the atmospheric oxygen
with a catalyst loading of 3.6 mol % at 100 °C in toluene (Table S2). The reaction proceeded smoothly and
completed almost quantitatively in 1 h. Replacing UiO-66–Ru
with UiO-66 or UiO-66–RuCl3 led to very low conversion
of benzyl alcohol, which indicated that the embedded Ru nanoparticles
were the active species for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol.

Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzylaldehyde with malononitrile
as a model reaction was conducted over bare UiO-66 and UiO-66–Ru,
respectively, to reveal whether the catalytic activity was from UiO-66
or Ru nanoparticles. The reaction was performed in 1.5 mL of toluene
at 100 °C with 0.25 mmol benzaldehyde and 0.3 mmol malononitrile.
As shown in Figure 10, bare UiO-66 exhibited higher activity than UiO-66–Ru, which
indicated that the catalytic activity was from UiO-66 due to the existence
of the Zrn+–O2– Lewis acid–base pair in its framework.63 The low activity of UiO-66–Ru compared to that of
bare UiO-66 could be ascribed to the deposition of Ru nanoparticles
on the Zr nodes of UiO-66, reducing the active sites exposed to the
reactants.

Figure 10 Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with malononitrile
over
UiO-66 and UiO-66–Ru.

Thereafter, UiO-66–Ru was applied to the one-pot tandem
aerobic oxidation/Knoevenagel condensation reaction of alcohols with
malononitrile. Benzyl alcohol was converted to the condensation product
benzylidene malononitrile in an isolated yield of 89.3% in a total
reaction time of 6 h (Table 4, entry 1). Various para- or meta-substituted benzyl alcohols
with either an electron-withdrawing or an electron-donating group
were smoothly converted to the corresponding condensation products
in high yields. Unexpectedly, random results were received in view
of the electronic effect of the substituent (Table 4, entries 2–9), which is different
with those of the NH2-MIL-101(Fe)-catalyzed photo-oxidation/Knoevenagel
condensation at room temperature.64 Herein, p-methoxy, p-methyl, and p-nitro substituted benzyl alcohols were transformed to the desired
products with similar yields (Table 4, entries 2, 5, 9), although nitro group is a strong
electron-withdrawing group and methoxy and methyl groups belong to
good electron-donating groups. In addition, p-fluorobenzyl
alcohol gave the highest yield among all halogenated benzyl alcohols
(Table 4, entries 6–8).
Steric hindrance has a large effect on the tandem reaction because
ortho-substituted benzyl alcohols exhibited poor results compared
to their para- or meta-substituted counterparts, and no desired condensation
product was received in the case of α-phenethyl alcohol as substrate.
These results indicated that the dehydration of the addition product
from aldehyde and malononitrile to benzylidene malononitrile was the
rate-determining step in the absence of steric hindrance; in the presence
of steric hindrance, the addition of malononitrile to aldehyde became

Condensation of Alcohols with Malononitrile Catalyzed by UiO-66–Rud
a Conversation and
selectivity were
determined by GC on the basis of area %.

b Isolated yield, calculated on the
basis of initial mmol of benzyl alcohol.

c Independent oxidation reaction,
reaction temperature 120 °C, O2 0.4 MPa.

d Reaction conditions: benzyl alcohol
(0.25 mmol), UiO-66–Ru (3.6 mol % Ru), toluene (1.5 mL), O2 1 atm, malononitrile (0.3 mmol), reaction temperature 100
°C.

Poor results were
obtained in the cases of primary heterocyclic
alcohols as substrates. Although 2-thiophenemethanol and 2-furanmethanol
were smoothly oxidized to their corresponding aldehydes, low yields
(41.3 and 56.0%) of the final condensation products were obtained
due to the formation of some unidentified impurities during the condensation
process (Table 4, entries
11, 12). This catalytic system was also less effective in the tandem
reaction of trans-cinnamyl alcohol due to the low conversion of the
intermediate cinnamaldehyde to the condensation product, in which
the isolated yield of the desired product was only 51.2% (Table 4, entry 13). Unfortunately,
no Knoevenagel condensation product was detected in the cases of 1-hexanol
and cyclohexanol as substrates, which are the representatives of aliphatic
alcohols as substrates, presumably due to the inactivity of the intermediate
aldehyde and ketone in the nucleophilic addition by the malononitrile.

The heterogeneity of the oxidation reaction was examined in the
oxidation of benzyl alcohol. After 18 min of reaction, the UiO-66–Ru
was removed by centrifugation and the liquid phase was stirred further
under identical conditions for 42 min. As shown in Figure 11a, the conversion remained
constant throughout the process. Similarly, the heterogeneity of the
Knoevenagel condensation was confirmed in the condensation of benzaldehyde
with malononitrile. After 2 h of reaction, the UiO-66–Ru was
removed by centrifugation and the liquid phase was stirred further
under identical conditions for 3 h. As shown in Figure 11b, the conversion did not
change with time. Both filter tests indicated that no active species
leaking took place during the reactions and UiO-66–Ru belongs
to a heterogeneous catalyst.

Figure 11 Filtration test for the tandem reactions over
UiO-66–Ru:
oxidation reaction (a), Knoevenagel condensation reaction (b).

Further experiments were performed
to evaluate the reusability
of UiO-66–Ru in the nitrobenzene reduction. After reaction,
UiO-66–Ru was recovered by centrifugation and subjected to
the next run. As shown in Figure 12, the conversion and selectivity were well maintained
in the consecutive runs, which manifested the good recyclability of
UiO-66–Ru in the nitrobenzene reduction. The SEM images disclosed
the framework of UiO-66–Ru did not change obviously after catalytic
runs. The XPS characterization revealed that the relative contents
of Ru0, RuO2, and RuO2·xH2O in the UiO-66–Ru did not change after
application in the reduction of nitrobenzene, indicating the stability
of the active species in the reaction. Besides, the molar ratio of
zirconium to ruthenium in the sample of UiO-66–Ru disclosed
by XPS and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) almost remained constant
before and after the reaction (Tables S3 and S4), demonstrating little leaching of ruthenium occurring in the catalytic
run. On the basis of the above results, it can be concluded that UiO-66–Ru
is a stable and recyclable catalyst in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene
to aniline with formic acid.

Figure 12 Recyclability of the UiO-66–Ru catalyst
for the reduction
of nitrobenzene.

Unfortunately, UiO-66–Ru
showed very poor reusability in
the tandem aerobic oxidation/Knoevenagel condensation of alcohols
with malononitrile. The deactivation of UiO-66–Ru occurred
in the oxidation step. As shown in Figure S2, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was only 56% in the second run
of the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. As shown in the SEM images
(Figure 5), the morphology
of the sample after use in alcohol oxidation did not change obviously
compared to that of the fresh one, which indicated that the deactivation
of UiO-66–Ru was not due to the collapse of the framework of
UiO-66. ICP analysis revealed that no big leaching occurred in the
reaction (Table S4) and the molar ratio
of Zr to Ru disclosed by XPS changed slightly after catalytic run
(Table S3). These results indicated that
the deactivation of UiO-66–Ru in the aerobic oxidation of alcohol
was not caused by the leaking of Ru in the reaction. As shown in Figure 3, obvious aggregation
of Ru particles took place during the aerobic oxidation of alcohols,
which could be ascribed to the main reason causing the deactivation
of the catalyst in the tandem aerobic oxidation/Knoevenagel condensation
of alcohols with malononitrile.

3 Conclusions
In summary, Ru nanoparticles were successfully embedded onto the
framework of UiO-66 with the postsynthesis method to afford UiO-66–Ru.
The characterization results revealed that most parts of the Ru nanoparticles
were deposited on the inner surfaces of the cavities of UiO-66. UiO-66–Ru
as a catalyst showed high activity and selectivity in the reduction
of nitroarenes to amines at elevated temperature and can be recycled
without obvious deactivation of its catalysis. UiO-66–Ru was
also active in the tandem aerobic oxidation/Knoevenagel condensation
of alcohols with malononitrile; however, it cannot be recycled in
this case due to the transformation of surface Ru0 to RuO2 of Ru nanoparticles under the aerobic oxidation conditions.
The surface Ru0 of Ru nanoparticles were regarded as the
active species for both the catalytic reduction of nitro compounds
and the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The activity for the Knoevenagel
condensation reaction was from the existence of the Zrn+–O2– Lewis acid–base
pair in the framework of UiO-66.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Terephthalic acid and ZrCl4 were obtained from J&K Scientific. RuCl3·3H2O was supplied by Xi’an Catalyst Chemical Co., Ltd.
The nitro compounds and alcohols were obtained from Alfa Aesar China
(Tianjin) Co., Ltd. All reagents were of analytical grade and used
without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis
of UiO-66
UiO-66 was prepared
in accordance with the methods described previously.26 Briefly, in a 3000 mL round-bottom flask, ZrCl4 (3.72 g, 16 mmol) was dissolved under stirring in a mixture of DMF
(1000 mL) and glacial acetic acid (288 g, 274.6 mL, 4.8 mol). In another
2000 mL round-bottom flask, terephthalic acid (2.66 g, 16 mmol) was
dissolved completely in DMF (1000 mL). The terephthalic acid solution
was slowly added into the ZrCl4 solution, and the resulting
mixture was stirred to a homogeneous solution. The solution was separated
into 100 vials. The vials were closed and heated at 120 °C for
24 h, then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture in the
vials was gathered, and the white powder UiO-66 product was collected
through centrifugation and rinsed with methanol to get a white solid
(3.0 g, 70% yield). The UiO-66 product was activated at 150 °C
under high vacuum for 12 h, stored at room temperature.

4.3 Synthesis of UiO-66–RuCl3
In a 100
mL round-bottom flask, RuCl3·3H2O (700
mg, 2.68 mmol) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (30 mL),
followed by the addition of the activated UiO-66 (1.5 g). The resulting
mixture was heated to 50 °C and maintained at this temperature
for 48 h in an oil bath. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
and the solid was collected through centrifugation. The unreacted
RuCl3 was removed by extraction with ethyl acetate in a
Soxhlet extractor for 24 h. The extracted solid was dried under air
to give UiO-66–RuCl3.

4.4 Synthesis
of UiO-66–Ru
The
UiO-66–Ru was synthesized referencing a previous method.65 NaBH4 (130 mg) was added to 70 mL
of deionized water in a round-bottom flask, after which 1.0 g of UiO-66–RuCl3 was added. The pH was controlled in the range of 6–8
throughout the addition of NaBH4. The obtained mixture
was stirred for 30 min, then was subject to filtration. The collected
solid was washed thoroughly with deionized water to give black powder
of UiO-66–Ru. Finally, the UiO-66–Ru was activated at
150 °C for 12 h under high vacuum. The content of Ru in UiO-66–Ru
is 3.1 wt %, determined by ICP-optical emission spectrometry (OES).

4.5 Catalysts Characterization
Powder
X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were recorded on a D8 Advance
X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Corporation, Germany) with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) and scanning speed of 12°/min
from 5 to 50° at ambient temperature. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was carried out on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope operating
at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by
dispersing the catalyst powder in ethanol under ultrasound and then
supported on a carbon film of copper grid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi system (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
with a standard Al Kα X-ray source. The contents of Ru were
analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
(ICP-OES, PerkinElmer). The specific surface areas of the catalyst
samples were measured by N2 adsorption method at 77 K using
ASAP2020M+C instrument (Micromeritics Company). Prior to the measurement,
the samples were degassed at 423 K for 12 h under high vacuum. Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA) was evaluated using an SDT Q-600 thermogravimetric
analyzer from 30 to 800 °C with a temperature rate of 20 °C/min
in air. SEM images were taken with a Nova Nano SEM450 instrument.

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 400 DRX spectrometer
in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 with tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard.

4.6 Reduction of Nitro Compounds
with Formic Acid
In a typical process, substrate nitro compound
(0.5 mmol), catalyst
(16.3 mg, 1 mol % Ru), formic acid (2.5 mmol), and 3 mL of isopropanol/water
(9:1) were successively charged into an autoclave, after which the
autoclave was sealed and purged with nitrogen. Then, the mixture was
stirred at 150 °C until the end of the reaction. The reaction
progress was monitored by a gas chromatograph (Shandong Lunan Ruihong
SP-7800A) equipped with a SE-54 column of 30 m. Because of very weak
response of formic acid on GC, the reaction mixture was directly subjected
to GC analysis without needing pretreatment to remove the formic acid.
The yield of the product was obtained by column chromatography separation.

4.7 General Procedure for One-Pot Tandem Oxidation/Knoevenagel
Condensation
Into a round-bottom flask, alcohol (0.5 mmol),
catalyst (3.6 mol % Ru), and toluene (1.5 mL) were added. The flask
was purged with O2 from a top balloon, and then the mixture
was stirred at 100 °C under 1 atm of oxygen to start the aerobic
oxidation of alcohol. The oxidation was monitored by GC. After completion
of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature.
Then, malononitrile (0.55 mmol) was added directly into the above
reaction mixture and the resulting mixture was stirred at 100 °C
further to finish the reaction. After reaction, the solvent was removed
by rotary evaporation under vacuum. The crude product was subject
to silica gel column chromatography eluted with petroleum ether–EtOAc
(5:1) to afford pure product.
