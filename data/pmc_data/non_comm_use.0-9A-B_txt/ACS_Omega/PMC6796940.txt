We
have investigated the production of benzyl alcohols
and bioaromatics via the reductive lignin depolymerization process
over Fe/H-style ultrastable Y (HUSY), Ni/HUSY, and Ni–Fe/HUSY
catalysts using HCOOK/ETOH in air. Synergy effect between HCOOK and
the catalysts improved the depolymerization process, resulting in
a higher bio-oil recovery. HCOOK does not act solely as an in situ
hydrogen source; it also interacts with lignin to enable its initial
depolymerization via a base-catalyzed mechanism to low-molecular-weight
fragments, and in tandem with the catalyst, the hydrogenolysis rate
of the depolymerized lignin monomers was enhanced. Fe/HUSY displayed
an excellent activity for the catalytic reductive step in contrast
to Ni/HUSY
and Ni–Fe/HUSY by facilitating methoxy group removal via hydrogenolysis,
thereby contributing to the yield and stabilization of the low-molecular-weight
aromatics [diethyl ether (DEE)-soluble products]. Fe/HUSY gave the
highest DEE product yield of >99 wt % and a total benzyl alcohol
yield
of 16 wt % with a total selectivity of 47 wt % (60 wt % for aromatic
alcohols). Fe/HUSY was reused for the lignin depolymerization reaction
without much loss of its initial activity, giving 13 wt % yield of
benzyl alcohols with a selectivity of 58 wt % (77 wt % for aromatic
alcohols).

==== Body
Introduction
The utilization of
lignocellulosic biomass as an alternative and
sustainable resource for production of fuels, chemicals, and materials
is progressively being regarded as a promising strategy to contribute
to net emission reduction of greenhouse gas.1 Lignin is one of the most abundant aromatic resources in nature
and accounts for about one-third of the organic carbon on earth; it
mainly consists of three phenylpropyl alcohols—p-courmaryl alcohol (H), coniferyl alcohol (G), and sinapyl alcohol
(S)—connected by carbon–ether (mostly β-O-4) and
carbon–carbon such as β–5, β–β,
and 5–5 bonds.2 The composition
and the proportion of the lignin subunits vary considerably between
different plant species, as well as the linkage types in the polymer
and the quantity of methoxy groups present on the aromatic ring.3 These differences play an important role during
lignin isolation from biomass. As such, organosolv lignin can be obtained
through the pretreatment of lignocellulose by certain solvents such
as ethanol, methanol, acetic acid, formic acid, or mixed organic solvents
with water.4 Organosolv lignin is known
to have a good solubility in polar organic solvents in comparison
to other technical lignins (e.g., kraft and soda lignins). It is a
sulfur-free lignin and has high purity and relatively lower molecular
weight compared with other technical lignins and so has a higher catalytic
conversion potential to valuable chemicals and products.5−7

Over the past few decades, numerous lignin depolymerization
methodologies
including thermochemical, catalytic, and oxidative approaches have
been studied for converting lignin into bioaromatics.3,8 However, recent research priorities have been on the development
of cheap transition-metal heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenolysis
process during the depolymerization process to reduce operating costs.9,10 Traditionally, heterogeneous acid catalysts, especially zeolites,
have been successfully used in industrial processes including catalytic
cracking, dealkylation, dehydration, and isomerization11,12 due to their low cost, high surface
area, and excellent acid catalytic performance.13−15 Meso-/microporous
zeolites with high Brønsted acid sites are reported to be highly
effective for dealkylation and de-etherification reactions during
lignin conversion processes.13−15 Ma et al.16 reported that using zeolite catalysts with different acidities
and pore sizes in catalytic fast pyrolysis greatly impacted the lignin
conversion to bioaromatics. As recently demonstrated by Wanmolee et
al.,17 H-style ultrastable Y (HUSY) catalyst
with a Si/Al molar ratio of 5 and large pore size outperformed other
HUSY types, H-BEA, and proton-exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalysts
with higher Si/Al ratios to produce the highest yield of bioaromatics
from organosolv lignin. Zhai et al.18 made
great effort in depolymerizing organosolv birch lignin in methanol
using bimetallic Ni–Fe catalysts supported on activated carbon
to enhance the selectivity and yield of aromatic monomers. Song et
al.19 showed that native lignin in birchwood
was effectively depolymerized in alcohol over Ni-based catalysts [on
supports such as Santa Barbara amorphous-15 (SBA-15)] into bioaromatics.
This and other studies indicated that the use of an external gaseous
H2 source may not be necessary. This is because solvents20−25 in sub- and supercritical conditions [e.g., methanol, ethanol (ETOH),
and 2-propanol] were shown to be effective in lignin hydrogenolysis
as a result of their advantageous properties in terms of hydrogen-donor
capacity, high lignin solubility, and high heat transfer conductivity.

Despite all of these research, key challenges still exist in developing
commercial viable technologies using technical lignins (such as organosolv
lignin) because of low product yield as a consequence of reduced proportion
of β-O-4 bonds and an increase in the proportion of condensed
carbon–carbon bonds. Furthermore, the use of organic solvents,
high catalyst loading, and catalyst stability in organic solvents
still pose problems. We have considered some of these issues, and
with the aim to improve the overall process economics, we have targeted
the production of two groups of compound classes, namely, benzyl alcohols
and bioaromatics (di- and polyaromatics). The former are used for
higher-value applications in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical
industries and will therefore lead to increased revenue, while the
latter have potential for the production of bioresins.

In this
study, mono- and bimetallic Ni and Fe supported on HUSY
zeolite catalysts were investigated in ethanol and ethanol–water
mixtures. Ethanol was selected as a solvent because it acts as a capping
agent and formaldehyde scavenger, thereby suppressing char formation.26 In addition, a comparison between the oxide
and metallic forms was performed and a depolymerization reaction was
conducted in the presence of H2 gas and using HCOOK as
a hydrogen donor for the in situ conversion of aromatic aldehydes
to aromatic alcohols. Simultaneously, the effect of the catalyst structure
and catalyst reusability was also determined. The structures of the
catalysts were investigated by several techniques, i.e., X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The efficiency of lignin depolymerization was
determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS),
while the types of gases produced with the different solvents were
measured by GC-thermal conductivity detector (TCD).

Results and Discussion
Catalyst
Characterization
Table 1 shows the main physical properties of the
synthesized catalysts. It can be seen that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and total pore volume decreased with metal addition
to the support as a result of the metal covering the zeolite support
as well as partially blocking the pore channels’ mouth.27 The total acidity increased in the order Fe
< HUSY < Ni–Fe < Ni. Two different types of acidic
sites (Table S1) were distinguished—the
weak acidic sites (signal maxima at 100–106 °C) and the
strong acidic sites (signal maxima at 386–585 °C). The
weaker sites are predominant in the Ni–Fe/HUSY (17.58 mmol
g–1) catalyst, but the stronger sites are present
in the Ni/HUSY (2.67 mmol g–1) catalyst. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns
for the support and metal-impregnated samples at the specific range
of 2θ = 40–80°.

a Total acidity is the sum of high-
and low-temperature peaks of acid sites’ concentration.

The unique diffraction peaks (2θ
= 10–38°) of
the HUSY support are shown in Figure S1 and correspond to a single crystalline phase with the faujasite
framework.28 For the metal catalysts, the
characteristic peaks of NiO and Fe2O3 (hematite)
were detected without any substantial transformation of the peak position,
indicating the existence of these oxides within the HUSY matrix (Figure 1). However, for the
5% Ni–5% Fe/HUSY bimetallic catalyst, the unit crystal size
of Fe2O3 is higher than that of the corresponding
monometallic catalyst—an indication of possible NiO particles’
inclusion in the crystal lattice of Fe2O3.

The micrographs from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of
Ni, Fe, and Ni–Fe catalysts with corresponding EDS elemental
mappings of Ni and Fe are depicted in Figure 2. The results reveal that Ni and Fe species
are well distributed on the zeolite surface with a uniform dispersion,
which is in good agreement with the mean metal crystallite size as
calculated from XRD patterns (Table 1). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
images of fresh 10% Ni/HUSY and 10% Fe/HUSY are also presented in Figure 2c,f. The HUSY zeolite
support is light gray, and oxides of Ni and Fe are shown as dark particles.
The NiO particles (inset of Figure 2c) are well defined as cubes, whereas the Fe2O3 particles (inset of Figure 2f) are less uniform and appear in clusters
of spherical particles.

and TEM images of the fresh catalysts: (c) 10% Ni/HUSY and (f) 10%

The chemical states of monometallic
Ni, Fe, and bimetallic Ni–Fe
catalysts were also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements. The high-resolution XPS (HR-XPS) results of Ni
2p, Fe 2p, and O 1s are presented in Figure 3A–C, respectively. All spectra were
first calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV and subtracted by
a Shirley background. In Figure 3A, the binding energies of Ni 2p3/2 (856.2
and 853.9 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (871.2 and 873.9 eV) peaks indicate
the characteristic peak of NiO. In addition, both Ni 2p3/2 (861.4 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (880.4 eV) peaks are also attributed
to Ni(OH)2.29,30 These peaks also clearly appear
in the bimetallic Ni–Fe/HUSY sample although no strong diffraction
peaks were found in XRD patterns. As shown in Figure 3B, two main peaks belonging to Fe 2p3/2 (710.3 eV) and Fe 2p1/2 (724.4 eV) appear in
the spectra of the monometallic Fe/HUSY and bimetallic Ni–Fe/HUSY
samples. These characteristics were related to Fe3+ in
α-Fe2O3,3131 and the results are consistent with the XRD
results. The XPS results of O 1s of the monometallic and bimetallic
catalyst samples are shown in Figure 3C, where three-band peaks are observed as previously
reported in the literature.32,33 The first highest peak
at 531.7 eV is associated with oxygen atoms in Si–O–M
(Si–O–Al) bonds, and the right shoulder peak at 529.0
eV was assigned to M–O–M bonds. The O 1s signal at 533.3
eV could be assigned to hydroxyl oxygen species or oxygen in SiO2 impurity.34,35

Catalytic Activities toward Lignin Depolymerization
Based
on our previous work on organosolv lignin conversion to monoaromatics
over the HUSY zeolite catalyst,17 it was
decided that the metal-doped HUSY zeolite should be investigated to
determine the catalytic effect of metal addition to zeolite on lignin
depolymerization in ETOH/H2O (50/50 vol %) at 350 °C
for 2 h in the presence of air. More importantly, the effect of the
addition of HCOOK on the catalyst properties and stability as well
as the presence of a hydrogen source was also examined. The product
yields [diethyl ether (DEE)-soluble, acetone soluble, and char] and
lignin conversion for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions are
summarized in Table 2, entries 1–5. Compared with the uncatalyzed reaction, the
metal-supported HUSY catalysts show higher lignin conversion and DEE-soluble
product yields but lower acetone-soluble product yield and char content.
There were also differences in the product yields between Fe and the
Ni supported catalysts. These results indicate that the nature of
the metal supported on the zeolite, i.e., physical and chemical characteristics,
plays important roles in product yields. Among these metal oxides,
the Fe/HUSY catalyst showed the highest DEE product yield (89.4 wt
%), while the lowest DEE product yield was obtained with the monometallic
Ni (76.4 wt %). It is well known that Ni has been widely used as a
catalyst in steam reforming and gasification reactions.36 The results from Lu’s study37 showed that Ni supported on MgO was a more effective
catalyst for biomass gasification compared with Fe/MgO catalysts,
producing more H2 and CO2 gases. The metals
Ni and Fe have different catalytic effects on the water–gas
shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2); therefore, a concomitant gasification reaction of the DEE-soluble
on the Ni/HUSY catalyst could promote some of the products into volatile
compounds and gases (i.e., H2 and CO2).

product composition of the DEE-soluble fractions.

Chen et al.38 reported that the pore
size could also affect lignin depolymerization performance. In this
work, addition of Fe produces a larger pore size than addition of
Ni to the zeolite, which probably contributed to enabling the high
yield of lower molecular fragments through steric constraints that
can hinder the interactions between the intermediate fragmented lignin
species and/or result in further decomposition into smaller-molecular-weight
compounds inside the pore channel.39 In
addition, Fe/HUSY has the highest mean metal crystal size and so provides
the largest surface coverage for the depolymerization process.

Table 2, entry 7,
shows that without the use of HCOOK and increasing three times the
amount of the catalyst, the DEE-soluble fraction obtained was very
low, whereas the char formed was 20 wt %, over 2× higher than
the blank where no catalyst was used. On the contrary, the presence
of HCOOK and a similar catalyst loading (Table 2, entry 6) significantly improved the yield
of the DEE-soluble fraction. This clearly suggests that the mechanism
of lignin depolymerization and subsequent stabilization of the fragmented
lignin intermediates is to a greater extent achieved by formate-mediated
reaction steps. Product selectivity as determined by GC–MS
for the DEE fractions and the total monomer yields are then summarized
in Figure 4, where
the main product compound groups have been classified as nonaromatics,
alkylphenolics, oxygenates, cyclic, aromatics, oxygenated polyaromatics,
and others (see detailed composition in Table S3). It is important to remark that in all experiments conducted
in this study (Table 3, except entry 7), it was established that mono-oxygenated compounds
syringol (1), vanillic acid (2), (alkyl)benzyl
alcohol (3), 3-phenylpropanol (4), 2-hydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone
(5), benzoic acid (6), and 5′-hydroxy-2′,3′,4′-trimethylacetophenone
(8) were obtained as the major compounds for the oxygenate
group, while 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenol (7) was the main
compound of the alkyl phenol group. In the case where no HCOOK was
added during reaction (Table 3, entry 7), compounds such as phenol, products 1 and 2, and other methoxylated phenol derivatives were
the dominant products obtained, an indication of the effectiveness
of the use of HCOOK to enhance demethoxylation through hydrogenolysis.
More importantly, HCOOK catalyzed the conversion of the aldehydes
to benzyl alcohols as was observed by Baidossi et al.40 A higher selectivity toward product 3 was obtained with
Ni/HUSY and Fe/HUSY compared with the bimetallic catalyst. However,
the yields of products 4 and 5 were similar in all conditions except
for the Ni/HUSY catalyst. A small amount of 6 was produced when the
Fe/HUSY catalyst was used. These results indicate that metal-based
Lewis acid catalysts such as Ni and Fe promote alkylation reaction
in the presence of alcohol as a solvent.41 However, Fe/HUSY shows a higher activity in compound 6 when the reaction was conducted under air. This is probably due
to Lewis acid-catalyzed transformation of alcohols to acids on the
Fe3+ sites of the Fe/HUSY catalyst, particularly alcohol
oxidation reactions42,43 where benzyl alcohol is oxidized
to acetophenone, benzaldehyde, and benzoic acid.44 The yield of total monomeric oxygenates reached a maximum
of 7.33 wt % using Fe/HUSY. Previous studies demonstrated that significant
deoxygenation and monomer formation were achieved with Ni/ZSM-5, Ni/Al-SBA-15,
and Ni-SBA-15.44,45 Hence, in this study, the metal-supported
HUSY catalysts showed lower deoxygenation and monomer yield because
of lower surface area and lower pore size compared with the mesoporous
catalysts and differences in reaction conditions used.

GC–MS at 350 °C with and without catalysts and using air
as the gas reactant (Table 2, entries 1–5). See Table S2 for further details of selectivity of composition of the DEE-soluble
products.

In conclusion, our results therefore
indicate that the Fe/HUSY
catalyst is more suitable for the reductive depolymerization of lignin
into small-molecular-weight compounds, i.e., benzyl alcohols, under
the conditions tested. Besides, it produced the highest amounts of
cyclic and aromatic compounds and, hence, was selected for further
studies.

Effect of Reactant Gas on Lignin Depolymerization
The
lignin depolymerization reaction was investigated in the presence
of air and hydrogen environments. The main product fractions obtained
after the reaction with their corresponding lignin conversions are
shown in Table 4, entries 1–7. It can be observed
that when hydrogen was present, higher yields of the DEE product (95.0–98.8
wt %) and char (3.0–7.5 wt %) are produced as compared with
when the reaction was conducted under air. Char formation tended to
occur with the addition of hydrogen gas, which may be ascribed to
the combined effects of activated adsorption of hydrogen on the metal
sites and the total number of acidic sites of the catalysts during
the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction of phenolic compounds.46 A relative decrease in the acetone-soluble fraction
was observed, except for the reaction where a physical mixture of
Ni/HUSY and Fe/HUSY was used. This result can be explained as interactions
between Ni and Fe species (as evidenced by XRD and XPS data, Figures 1 and 3, respectively) when impregnated in the same HUSY support,
synergistically influenced product yield, and selectivity (Figure 5). Gaseous products
on all of the catalysts tested were similar; H2 and CO2 were the two main gases analyzed by the GC (Figure S2).

As shown in Figure 6, the depolymerization
reaction of lignin, carried out with Ni/HUSY
under a hydrogen environment, has the highest selectivity for the
aromatics and the total monoaromatics in the oxygenates group category.
More so, Table 3 entry
19 showed that the maximum yield of benzyl alcohol (product 3), 10.43 wt %, was obtained with Ni/HUSY even though both
Ni/HUSY and Fe/HUSY produced similar yields out of all of the monomeric
compounds combined together (16.88 and 16.32 wt %). The Ni/HUSY catalyst,
under a hydrogen atmosphere, also selectively produced 2-cyclohexen-1-ylidene
that belongs to the cyclic group. Ni/HUSY is a common bifunctional
hydrodeoxygenation catalyst with both active metal and acid sites
of the support. However, the in situ formation of high-molecular-weight
products, such as naphthalenes and anthracenes (Table S3), via the polymerization of intermediates of phenolic
compounds during breakup of the active ArO–CH3 bond44 negatively impacted the hydrodeoxygenation reaction,
promoting char formation. The compounds 2H-pyran-2-one,
tetrahydro-4-methyl essentially disappeared, but the oxygenated polyaromatic
group remained the same for the Ni/HUSY catalyst. The selectivity
toward nonaromatic compounds was lower with Fe/HUSY but that of the
alkyl phenols was higher in contrast to the Ni/HUSY catalyst. Compared
with the metal-oxide-based catalysts (Table 3, entries 3–5), the reduced catalysts
(Table 3, entries 16–22)
significantly increased product 3 concentration (i.e.,
benzyl alcohols) up to 10.43 wt %. These results imply that the depolymerization
of lignin in ETOH/H2O mixtures under a reducing reaction
environment promoted the removal of methoxy groups by hydrogenolysis
along with C-alkylation.

with 30% catalyst loading in ETOH (Table 2, entries 12–15). See Table S9 for further details of selectivity of
composition of the DEE-soluble products.

Effect of Reaction Time and Ethanol Content on Product Type
and Yield
As shown in Table 3, the highest values of monoaromatics were obtained
when the reaction was conducted in the presence of an external hydrogen
source. Thus, we decided to investigate whether increasing the reaction
time and using ETOH alone as the solvent over the Fe/HUSY catalyst
would be an alternative means to produce high values of monoaromatics
without the use of an expensive external hydrogen source. Prior to
investigating the use of ETOH alone as a solvent, we examined different
ETOH/H2O ratios to identify the role water played as a
cosolvent in the depolymerization process. The results indicated that
the highest selectivity of monoaromatics and cyclic compounds can
be achieved with the ETOH solvent alone, with a reduced number of
compounds formed, i.e., better selectivity (Figure S3 and Table S5). Interestingly, cedranone (though with very
low selectivity) was produced when the reaction was performed in ETOH
alone. This was also evident from previous works,46−48 where ETOH
was consumed by a self-condensation reaction forming hydrocarbons,
alcohols, and esters via Guerbet-type reactions. The selectivity of
5-isopropyl-3,3-dimethyl-2-methylene-2,3-dihydrofuran as well as 2H-pyran-2-one, tetrahydro-4-methyl- was dominant in the
ETOH/H2O ratio of 25:75. The two-dimensional heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (2D HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
(Figure S4 and Table S6) spectrum of the
parent lignin with signals of resinol and spirodienone lignin substructures
disappeared after liquefaction and may have degraded to selectively
produce 2,3-dihydrofuran derivatives.4931P NMR also (Figure S5 and Table S7) showed that the 4–O–5 linkage of lignin disappeared
after reaction. The spirodienone structure in the oxygenated polyaromatic
group was undetected when the ethanol content was greater than 50%
by volume. The condensation products were mainly diaromatic components
such as biphenyl-2-yl-methanol and naphthol with molecular weights
higher than 200 g mol–1. These oxygenated products
may be formed via either oligomerization of the monomeric products48 or cyclization of the hexyl-alkylated aromatics.

Entries 4, 6, 8, and 9 of Table 2 show the lignin conversion and product yields obtained
at different Fe/HUSY-to-lignin ratios from 0.1 to 1 by weight. Lignin
conversion increased with the catalyst loading amount to reach a maximum
of about 98 wt % conversion at a 1:1 lignin/catalyst ratio. Similarly,
DEE-soluble products increased to a maximum yield of about 92 wt %;
however, it declined with further increment in the catalyst loading.
This is because of the accelerated decomposition of HCOOK, generating
molecular hydrogen that subsequently reacts rapidly to stabilize the
depolymerized lignin fragments before repolymerization to heavier
molecular fractions, accounting for the progressive reduction of the
acetone product and char yields. Meanwhile, hydrogenolysis and deoxygenation
of lignin toward monoaromatic and oligomeric products were also favored
as catalyst loading increased, thus accounting for the increased proportion
of the total monomer yield in the oxygenates (Figure S6 and Table S8). However, the noticeable decline of
DEE products (Table 2, entries 4, 6, 8, and 9) and monomer yield (Figure S6) after the catalyst/lignin ratio of 0.3:1 is indicative
of the consecutive conversion of the low-molecular-weight (LMW) fractions
into gaseous compounds.

The effect of reaction time on the lignin
conversion and product
yields in the presence of Fe/HUSY with 30% catalyst loading using
ETOH alone as the solvent was therefore studied (Table 2, entries 12–15). From
the analysis of results, the reaction time was also an important factor
in both DEE and acetone product yields. DEE product yield increased
with reaction time, while there was a corresponding decrease in the
acetone fraction. This result is in good agreement with that of Limarta
et al.,50 whose studies also observed a
similar trend during the lignin depolymerization process in supercritical
ETOH. Significant amounts of char were formed at a moderate reaction
time (2 h) and then decreased as the reaction time progressed. The
reason for this is not known but may be related to the modification
of the catalyst with reaction time, as when using methanol as the
solvent, the product yield as well as lignin conversion is lower than
those of ETOH as the solvent. A large amount of acetone-soluble product
was formed (16.6 wt %), which was consistent with previous reports
in which depolymerization in methanol (Table 2, entry 16) produced higher-molecular-weight
compounds, implying that lignin depolymerization conducted under ETOH
is more effective in suppressing repolymerization reactions than methanol.21,51

Figure 6 shows
the
time versus selectivity plot for the main groups of compounds. It
also shows the progressive yield of the monoaromatics from 0.5 to
4 h. The selectivity of the nonaromatics (i.e., the fatty acids, endogenous
to lignin, and fatty acid esters) did not change at 1 h but significantly
did thereafter corresponding to the increase in the monoaromatic content.
The selectivity for the oxygenates also decreased but not as sharply
as that of the nonaromatics. The selectivity of the cyclic, aromatics,
and oxygenated polyaromatics increased with reaction time. It is probable
that the decrease in the selectivity of the nonaromatics during depolymerization
could be due to their catalytic decomposition to hydrocarbons.47 The formation of the latter would then enhance
deoxygenation and consequently increase the formation of nonaromatics.
The product mixtures obtained after hydrothermal treatment of lignin
with ETOH/HCOOK in Fe/HUSY for 2 and 4 h (Table 2, entries 12 and 15) were further analyzed
by the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) technique
(Figure S7). The result showed that the
intensities of lower-molecular-weight compounds obtained for 4 h were
higher than those obtained at 2 h, confirming that increasing the
reaction time increases the formation of the monoaromatics, under
the conditions used in this work.

The main monomeric products
obtained with ETOH with increasing
reaction time were determined, and the results are presented in Table 3, entries 12–15.
Compound 3 significantly increased with time, while there
was a gradual increase in yield with 4. Compound 6, however, decreased with time. The yield of compound 5 reached a maximum at 2 h and decreased thereafter. A value
of 17.84 wt % was obtained for the monoaromatics with Fe/HUSY under
an air atmosphere at 4 h, a value slightly higher than that obtained
with Ni/HUSY (16.88 wt %) and Fe/HUSY (16.32 wt %) in the presence
of hydrogen after 2 h. Also, the benzyl alcohol (3) yield
was in the order 6 wt % [Fe/HUSY (in air)] > 10.4 wt % [Fe/HUSY
(in
H2)] > 10 wt % [Ni/HUSY (in H2)]. As such,
the
combined use of HCOOK and ETOH provided enough hydrogen in situ and
hydrocarbons for the depolymerization process, thus eliminating the
need for an external hydrogen source.

From the above experimental
results, the possible pathway for the
formation of these monomeric products is via the reaction mechanism
that involves the base-catalyzed formation of a reactive quinone methide–enol
ether intermediate since the lignin depolymerization reaction was
performed in an alkaline condition (starting pH = 11).52,53 The depolymerized fragment, especially the enol ethers, then undergoes
a catalytic reductive step with the in situ hydrogen generated from
HCOOK via the decomposition of formate ions.54 The hydrogen reductive step of the fragmented lignin species via
processing such as hydrogenolysis and/or hydrodeoxygenation on the
catalyst, accompanied by an increase in the degree of demothxylation
and deoxygenation, thus generates stable monomeric and dimeric compounds
as well. In addition, solvent-aided catalytic conversion cannot be
excluded as alkylation of the depolymerized fragments with ethanol
may also occur through either O-alkylation of phenolic intermediates
or C-alkylation of the aromatic rings.21

Study of Spent Fe/HUSY
To test the stability of the
catalyst, the spent catalyst was recycled and reused for the depolymerization
reaction under similar experimental conditions (ETOH/H2O, 50:50 vol % at 2 h in HCOOK) as the fresh catalyst. The DEE-soluble
fraction yield was 83.01 wt % at 88.17 wt % lignin conversion, corresponding
to approximately 10 wt % decrease in the catalytic activity (Table S10). However, the yield of the monoaromatics
significantly reduced by about 30 wt % (Figure S8). This decline of the catalytic activity is expected since
during depolymerization of lignin over acidic zeolite catalysts, a
large number of aromatic compounds are formed, where some of these
eventually react to form char, which influence catalyst performance
when it is recycled. A repeat experiment with the spent Fe/HUSY catalyst
and HCOOK/ETOH was carried out but at a longer time of 4 h. Table S10 shows that the lignin conversion was
97.5 wt % and the DEE-soluble fraction was >99 wt %. Table S11 shows that the selectivity for the
total benzyl
alcohols was 58 wt % (77 wt % for total aromatic alcohols) and the
yield was ∼13 wt % (Table 3, entry 24). These results are comparable to those
obtained with fresh Fe/HUSY, although with higher selectivity. Unfortunately,
further recycling experiments could not be conducted because of significant
catalyst loss during recovery and the coverage of the catalytic sites
with carbon and ash.

As mentioned earlier, using HCOOK during
reaction not only produces in situ hydrogen but also suppresses char
formation. To gain an insight into the changes that occurred on the
catalyst surface, HR-XPS analysis was conducted on the fresh and spent
Fe/HUSY catalysts. The characterization results are summarized in Figure 7a–d. The C
1s peak dramatically increased after depolymerization of lignin for
the spent catalyst compared with the fresh one, indicating that highly
dehydrogenated carbonaceous species were formed. A comparison of the
Fe 2p spectra for fresh and spent Fe/HUSY catalysts, irrespective
of the differences in the electron binding energy, shows that the
electronic state significantly affected the structure of the shake-up
peaks (satellites) and that particular important changes took place
in the yellow region (Figure 7b,d) of the Fe 2p3/2 species (Fe3+).
We observed that the surface atomic concentration of Fe decreased
from 3.6 to 0.8%, whereas that of carbon increased by almost 4-fold
from 11.9 to 45.2%. Hence, this suggests carbonaceous species covering
the surface of the catalyst.

(a, b) fresh, before
depolymerization reaction, (c, d) spent, after depolymerization reaction
with HCOOK in ETOH/H2O (50:50 vol %) at 350 °C for
2 h.

XRD of the spent Fe/HUSY catalyst
was carried out to probe its
structural integrity after the depolymerization process. The XRD (Figure 8) spectra obtained
for the spent catalyst were significantly different when compared
with the fresh catalyst. The peak intensity of the spent catalyst
was greatly attenuated (Figure 8b), and after the second cycle of reusing the spent catalyst
(Figure 8c), no observable
difference was noticed in peak intensity. This structural change has
arisen due to desilication of the fresh catalyst, which may have led
to a partial collapse of the zeolite framework.55 Also, it may be due to the fact that deposited carbon (confirmed
by XPS) on the catalyst surface is amorphous in nature.

Conclusions
This work has demonstrated that lignin
can be depolymerized in
a HCOOK/ETOH reaction system utilizing a HUSY zeolite-based catalyst.
The process is highly selective for organosolv lignin conversion into
the high-value benzyl alcohols and bioaromatics, utilizing HCOOK as
the hydrogen donor for the catalytic reductive step. Moreover, HCOOK
not only was able to facilitate the fragmentation of lignin into low-molecular-weight
fractions but also hinders the fragmented species from condensation
into heavier compounds. Thermocatalytic reduction of lignin considerably
increased the depolymerization rate of lignin as well as the hydrogenolysis
of the lightweight compounds. Fe/HUSY demonstrated promising performance
in the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the fragmented lignin species
into monomeric aromatics, especially in the conversion of aldehydes
into benzyl alcohol. To a lesser extent, complimentary reactions on
the catalyst such as hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and alkylation contributed
to increased oil yield and stabilization of the aromatic monomers.
Fe/HUSY exhibited good catalytic performance, which could be ascribed
to its acidity and structural and geometrical configurations. Product
selectivity and yield can be tuned depending on the type of metal
site on the HUSY support; however, process conditions such as alcohol/water
ratio, type of alcohol, catalyst concentration, gaseous environment,
and reaction time have considerable effects as well. The spent Fe/HUSY
can be reused, and its catalytic behavior for the depolymerization
reaction was found to be close to that of the fresh one in terms of
the yield toward benzyl alcohol, which stabilized at 13 wt % yield
corresponding to 77 wt % selectivity of aromatic alcohols. Thus, the
implementation of a transition-metal-based catalyst in combination
with an environmental-friendly hydrogen source represents an economically
feasible approach to lignin valorization.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Materials
Eucalyptus wood chips were
obtained from The Siam Forestry Co., Ltd. in Kanchanaburi province,
Thailand. They were air-dried at 70 °C overnight and then cut
with Retsch SM 200 (Hann, Germany) to an average particle size of
0.5 mm in diameter. Eucalyptus lignin (EUL) was fractionated from
the biomass according to a procedure described in detail in a previous
publication.56 In summary, 10% (w/v) eucalyptus
wood particles were pulped in a 79% (v/v) ternary mixture of ethyl
acetate/ETOH/H2O (32:25:43) with 21% (v/v) formic acid
at 164 °C for 45 min with the initial pressure of 20 bar N2. The EUL was then recovered from the organic solvent by separation,
filtration, evaporation, and drying at 105 °C.

Commercial
HUSY (Si/Al molar ratio = 5) zeolite catalyst was purchased from TOSOH,
Japan. The aromatic monomers that were used for product quantification
are benzoic acid, benzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, 2-methylbenzyl
alcohol, 4-ethylbenzyl alcohol, 3-phenylpropyl alcohol, and 2-hydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone,
which were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate
[Ni(NO3)2·6H2O] was purchased
from Univar, Australia, and iron(III) nitrate nanohydrate [Fe(NO3)3·9H2O] was obtained from Ajax
Finechem, Australia. All chemicals and reagents were used as received.

The composition of EUL (Tables S6, S7, S12, and S13 and Figures S4, S5, S9, and S10) was analyzed using
the standard Klason lignin method, pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 2D heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (HSQC), and phosphorous (31P)
NMR. The amounts of Klason lignin, acid soluble lignin, total carbohydrate
contents, and ash are 89.9, 2.7, 5.4, and 1.0 wt %, respectively.
Py-GC/MS was used to analyze the EUL substructures in which H, G,
and S contents are 1.5, 29.6, and 68.9%, respectively.

Catalyst Preparation
and Characterization
The catalysts
were prepared by means of incipient wetness impregnation. To prepare
the catalyst precursor, the calculated amount of the required metal
salt content [i.e., Ni(NO3)2·6H2O or Fe(NO3)3·9H2O] was dissolved
in deionized water. The aqueous solution was then impregnated on HUSY
by continuous stirring at 60 °C followed by microwave-drying57 at 450 W maximum output power for 5 min.58 The sample was calcined in air at 400 °C
for 4 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 to
obtain the metal oxide form. The catalysts that were prepared contain
10 wt % Fe, 10 wt % Ni, and 5 wt % Fe and 5 wt % Ni for the bimetallic
catalyst. The catalysts were labeled as 10% Ni/HUSY, 10% Fe/HUSY,
and 5% Ni–5% Fe/HUSY. Catalyst reduction was also conducted
by reacting at 400 °C for 5 h in 5 vol % H2/Ar atmospheres.

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained
at liquid N2 temperature (−196 °C) using BELSORP-max
MicrotracBEL equipment (Japan). Prior to each measurement, the samples
were degassed at 200 °C overnight on a vacuum line. The specific
surface area and pore properties of the catalysts were calculated
by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique. The pore
size distribution curve was determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
model on the desorption isotherm curve.

The total acidity of
the fresh solid catalysts was analyzed by
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) with ammonia. The catalysts
were performed in BEL-CAT-A-200, a chemisorption apparatus consisting
of a gas mixing unit, a U-tube quartz microreactor with a thermocouple,
and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Then, 50 mg of the sample
was pretreated in He flow (50 mL min–1) at 500 °C
for 1 h and then exposed to 5 vol % NH3/He at room temperature
for 30 min. TPD was carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in a flow of He (50 mL min–1),
and NH3 was desorbed and monitored by a TCD detector.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) spectra of fresh and spent solid
catalysts were collected using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer
operating in Bragg–Brentano geometry with a cobalt source at
40 kV and 40 mA at step size of 0.016° in the range of 4–90°.
Incident optics included 0.05 rad Soller slits, a 0.5° fixed
divergence slit, a 2° fixed antiscatter slit, and a 15 mm mask.
Receiving optics before the X’Celerator detector included 0.05
rad Soller slits, a 5.0 mm fixed antiscatter slit, and an iron Kβ
filter. The samples were spun during data collection. Phase identification
was performed using PDF4+ and ICSD databases in X’Pert Highscore
Plus (v4.5, PANalytical) and Jade (v4.1.0, Materials Data Inc.).

The morphology and elemental composition of the catalysts were
analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (JEOL 7001F FESEM) at an
accelerating voltage of 15 kV connected with an Oxford X-Max 80 mm2 SDD EDS detector using chemical standards for semiquantification.
The chemical states of elements in the fresh and spent catalysts were
anatomized by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Kratos Analytical,
U.K.). High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) was
also employed to determine the information on the chemical composition
and oxidation state of the fresh and spent metal oxide catalysts.
Atomic contents (%) were calculated using CasaXPS version 2.3.19 software
(Manchester, U.K.). Peak fitting of the high-resolution data was also
carried out using CasaXPS software.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrographs were taken on
the fresh Fe/HUSY and Ni/HUSY catalysts as they both showed better
catalytic activities than the bimetallic catalyst from the initial
screening tests. The TEM microscope used was a JEOL JEM2100 transmission
electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
Images were acquired on a TVIPS XF416 camera, and spectra were acquired
with an Oxford X-Max energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer.

Catalytic
Lignin Depolymerization
For the depolymerization
reaction, a mixture of lignocellulosic material and ETOH/H2O [1.75% (w/v)] was transferred to a 25 mL stainless steel high-pressure
reactor (Parr Reactor 4740, Parr Instrument, Moline, IL) with and
without a catalyst. A known amount of HCOOK (7.43 mmol) was then added
to the reactor. The reactor was heated in a sand bath at different
reaction conditions depending on the experimental requirement. At
the end of the reaction time, the reactor was rapidly quenched in
a water bath to stop further reaction. A standard workup procedure
for separating the products from the reaction mixture is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Workup procedure for
product separation after liquefaction.

Briefly, the content in the reactor was decanted into a container,
and the reactor was washed with distilled water to recover any residue.
The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to 2.0 using 1 M HCl to precipitate
the solid from the liquid phase and retain the soluble phenols in
the latter phase. The acidified mixture was then filtered with No.
52 Whatman filter paper. The liquid was extracted with diethyl ether
(DEE) to recover low-molecular-weight (LMW) products (i.e., phenolic
monomers and oligomers). The DEE was also used to recover other LMW
compounds in the water fraction. The combined DEE-soluble fraction
was mixed with Na2SO4 to remove residual water,
filtered, and then evaporated to recover the phenolic monomers and
oligomers. The DEE-insoluble fraction was dissolved in acetone, and
the solid (i.e., catalyst and char) was separated by filtration. The
acetone-soluble fraction was evaporated to obtain the heavy-molecular-weight
products. Then, products were dried under vacuum at 45 °C overnight.
All fractions were expressed on a dry basis. Experiments were conducted
in duplicate.

Product Characterization
Phenolic
products in the DEE-soluble
fraction were identified and quantified using a GC–MS system
(Agilent J&W GC columns 6890 app Hephaestus) equipped with an
Agilent HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm;
Agilent). The temperature program of the oven was set at 90 °C
for 10 min; then, it was ramped up to 300 °C at a rate of 4 °C
min–1 and kept at this temperature for 5 min. Wiley
library-HP G1035A and NIST library of mass spectra and subsets-HP
G1033A were used for the identification of products released (a criterion
quality value ≥80% was used). Calibration standards were prepared
for the quantification of the main phenolic monomers.

The yields
of phenolic monomers, DEE-soluble product, acetone-soluble product,
char, and lignin conversion were calculated using the following equations 1   2   3   4   5  

Product
Gas Analysis
Gas compounds were identified
via a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014, Japan). The mixture gas
products were satisfactorily separated by the use of a 50/80 ShinCarbon
ST column (2 m × 2 mm I.D., Agilent). The outlet of the gas chromatograph
column was directly connected to both the thermal conductivity detector
(TCD) and the flame ionization detector. Gas analysis was conducted
for the experiments that involved the use of the reduced catalysts.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Two-dimensional (2D)
heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) was used to analyze
the products. The sample was prepared by dissolving 25–30 mg
of materials in 0.75 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6). The 1H
and 13C correlation 2D HSQC spectra were recorded at room
temperature using a 600 MHz spectrometer (Agilent) equipped with a
cooled 5 mm TCI Cryoprobe (cold 1H and 13C channels).
The spectrometer frequency of 600 MHz was used for 1H and
150 MHz in the case of 13C dimensions detection. A total
of 1024 complex points were collected for the 1H dimension
with a 1.5 s recycle delay. A total of 64 transients at 256 time increments
were recorded for the 13C dimension. The central solvent
(DMSO-d6) peak was used as an internal
chemical shift reference point (δC/δH 39.5/2.49). The spectra were acquired using an adiabatic HSQC pulse
program (Bruker standard pulse sequence “hsqcetgpsi2”)
under the following conditions: spectra were acquired from 10 to 0
ppm in F2 (1H) using 200 ms, and an interscan delay of
1 s, and from 165 to 0 ppm in F1 (13C) using 256 increments
of 32 scans with a total acquisition time of 2 h 40 min. 1JCH used was 145. The spectral widths
of 1H and 13C dimensions were 5 and 20 kHz,
respectively. The processing used a shifted squared sine bell Gaussian
apodization in 1H and 13C. HSQC data processing
and plots were carried out using ACD/NMR processing software, with
automatic phase and baseline correction.
