The
United States and numerous other countries worldwide are currently
experiencing a public health crisis due to the abuse of illicitly
manufactured fentanyl (IMF) and its analogues. This manuscript describes
the development of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based
method for the multiplex detection of N = 24 IMF
analogues and metabolites in whole blood at concentrations as low
as 0.1–0.5 ng mL–1. These available IMFs
were fentanyl, norfentanyl, furanyl norfentanyl, remifentanil acid,
butyryl norfentanyl, remifentanil, acetyl fentanyl, alfentanil, AH-7921,
U-47700, acetyl fentanyl 4-methylphenethyl, acrylfentanyl, para-methoxyfentanyl, despropionyl fentanyl (4-ANPP), furanyl
fentanyl, despropionyl para-fluorofentanyl, carfentanil,
(±)-cis-3-methyl fentanyl, butyryl fentanyl,
isobutyryl fentanyl, sufentanil, valeryl fentanyl, para-fluorobutyryl fentanyl, and para-fluoroisobutyryl
fentanyl. Most IMF analogues (N = 22) could be easily
distinguished from one another; the isomeric forms butyryl/isobutyryl
fentanyl and para-fluorobutyryl/para-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl could not be differentiated. N = 13 of these IMF analogues were quantified for illustrative purposes,
and their forensic quality control standards were also validated for
limit of detection (0.017–0.056 ng mL–1),
limit of quantitation (0.100–0.500 ng mL–1), selectivity/sensitivity, ionization suppression/enhancement (87–118%),
process efficiency (60–95%), recovery (64–97%), bias
(<20%), and precision (>80%). This flexible, time- and cost-efficient
method was successfully implemented at the Montgomery County Coroner’s
Office/Miami Valley Regional Crime Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, where
it aided in the analysis of N = 725 postmortem blood
samples collected from February 2015 to November 2016.

==== Body
Introduction
Fentanyl is a synthetic
opioid that was developed for pharmaceutical
use in 1960 by Paul Janssen in Belgium.1−4 Since its introduction into the United States
in 1970, fentanyl has rapidly become a leading analgesic and anesthetic
agent due to its 50–100 times higher potency than that of morphine,
shorter onset, and quicker absorption by the human body.3,4 Fentanyl causes depression of the respiratory and central nervous
system in a dose-dependent manner. Over the past few years, increased
availability and abuse of illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) and
its analogues emerged as a significant threat to public health in
the United States and other countries.5−10 Ohio is one of several U.S. states that was gravely impacted by
the opioid epidemic; the number of IMF-related overdose deaths increased
by 526% between 2013 and 2015.11 Even more
alarming is the fact that new IMF analogues are being synthesized
in Asian countries and marketed on a regular basis across United States
and Europe in an attempt to stay ahead of regulations.12−14 Many of these analogues have increased potency compared with IMF.
For example, carfentanil or the so called “elephant tranquilizer”
entered the U.S. market in July 2016 and is known to be 100 times
more potent than fentanyl.15,16 From July to November
2016, over 80% of all carfentanil positive cases in the United States
(i.e., N = 451 cases) were reported in Ohio.17

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
has responded to this epidemic
by declaring IMF a public health safety factor on March 18th, 2015.8 Unfortunately, IMF and its analogues are not
always part of routine toxicology testing in the United States. Thus,
there is an urgent need for developing sensitive, multiplex detection
methods that could be easily modified to include newly emerging IMF
analogues. A successful method was reported in 2017 by the Miami-Dade
County Medical Examiner Department, where an ultrahigh performance
liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry system with MSn capabilities (UHPLC-Ion-Trap-MSn) was employed for the qualitative identification
of N = 13 IMF analogues (i.e., acetyl fentanyl, alfentanil,
β-hydroxythiofentanyl, butyryl fentanyl, carfentanil, despropionyl
fentanyl, fentanyl, furanyl fentanyl, norfentanyl, 4-fluoroisobutyryl
fentanyl, 4-fluorobutyryl fentanyl, sufentanil, and U-47700) in postmortem
samples.18

The key aim of this study
is to describe the development and validation
of a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based
method for the multiplex detection of N = 24 IMF
analogues, metabolites, and synthetic opioids. The IMF analogues were
selected on the basis of previous forensic reports and their presence
on the Dark Web:19 (1) norfentanyl, (2)
furanyl norfentanyl, (3) remifentanil acid, (4) butyryl norfentanyl,
(5) remifentanil, (6) acetyl fentanyl, (7) alfentanil, (8) AH-7921,
(9) U-47700, (10) acetyl fentanyl 4-methylphenethyl, (11) acrylfentanyl,
(12) fentanyl, (13) para-methoxyfentanyl, (14) despropionyl
fentanyl (4-ANPP), (15) furanyl fentanyl, (16) despropionyl para-fluorofentanyl, (17) carfentanil, (18) (±)-cis-3-methyl fentanyl, (19) butyryl fentanyl, (20) isobutyryl
fentanyl, (21) para-fluorobutyryl fentanyl, and (22) para-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl, (23) sufentanil, and (24)
valeryl fentanyl (Figure 1). U-47700 is not an analogue of fentanyl and is not approved
as a pharmaceutical agent, but it is typically included in fentanyl
studies because of its similar, potent analgesic activity and combination
with IMF in cases of overdose deaths.20 AH-7921 is also a synthetic opioid analgesic that was placed into
schedule I of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act in 2016.21 It is usually incorporated in fentanyl-related
studies due to its structure being similar to that of IMF and potency
comparable to that of morphine.22

and synthetic opioids used for the development of the LC-MS/MS-based
method.

In this study, LC-MS/MS is the
analytical method of choice because
of its common use in numerous forensic and toxicology laboratories
across the nation.23 LC has become the
leading separation technique in chromatography due to its flexibility,
accuracy, and efficiency. Although LC achieves the physical separation
of multiple components in a mixture, MS offers information about their
structural identity. The addition of tandem MS technology further
improves the specificity and accuracy of the detection method. The
triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (QQQ) capability of the selected
system facilitates the simultaneous identification and quantification
of fentanyl analogues. QQQ performs a true multiple-reaction monitoring
(MRM) mode scan because both mass analyzers can simultaneously monitor
quantitative and qualitative transition ions. Running dynamic MRM24,25 is desired for rapid and simple quantifications due to its dynamic/noble
range and sensitivity.26 Pairing LC-MS/MS
with solid phase extraction (SPE)27 allows
for the identification and quantification of IMF analogues from postmortem
blood.

Experimental Section
Materials
High-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC)
grade water and acetonitrile (ACN) were purchased from Honeywell (Morris
Plains, NJ). Formic acid (88%), methanol, ammonium formate, potassium
phosphate monobasic-sodium hydroxide buffer solution (phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), pH 6.0), glacial acetic acid, ammonium hydroxide, isopropanol,
and methylene chloride were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA). Certified reference standards of acetyl fentanyl, acetyl norfentanyl,
alfentanil, sufentanil, fentanyl, and norfentanyl were acquired from
both Cerilliant (Round Rock, TX) and Lipomed (Cambridge, MA). Butyryl
fentanyl and (±)-cis-3-methyl fentanyl were
procured from both Lipomed and Cayman Chemical. Butyryl norfentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl, para-fluorobutyryl
fentanyl, furanyl fentanyl, furanyl norfentanyl, valeryl fentanyl,
acrylfentanyl, isobutyryl fentanyl, despropionyl para-fluorofentanyl, 4-ANPP, U-47700, 4-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl, para-methoxyfentanyl, acetyl fentanyl 4-methylphenethyl
analogue, and AH-7921 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor,
MI). Remifentanil and remifentanil metabolite were obtained from Cerilliant.
Internal standards were acetyl fentanyl-13C6, fentanyl-d5, and norfentanyl-d5 from Cerilliant. Carfentanil was donated by
DEA. Clean screen drugs of abuse (DAU) SPE columns were acquired from
United Chemical Technologies Worldwide Monitoring (Bristol, PA).

Instrumentation
Two different LC-MS/MS systems (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) were employed for validation purposes:
(1) a 1200 series LC system (Binary HPLC Pump, high-performance autosampler,
and vacuum degasser) equipped with a 6410 triple quadrupole, and (2)
an HPLC 1260 Infinity system (binary pumps, a six-port valve, and
high-performance autosampler) coupled to a 6420 triple quadrupole
HPLC-MS/MS system. The analytical column on both instruments was a
Raptor biphenyl LC column (150.0 mm x 3.0 mm, 2.7 μm) that was
purchased from Restek (Bellefonte, PA). SPE was done on a UCT Positive
Pressure Manifold.

Preparation of Calibration and Quality Control
Solutions
Stock standards and stock controls of 1 and 100
ng mL–1 were prepared for all IMF analogues by dilution
of the purchased
certified reference material in methanol and were stored at −4
°C for up to 3 months. All standards (0.1–50.0 ng mL–1) and quality controls (0.35, 2.5, and 25.0 ng mL–1) were made by serial dilution from stocks directly
into treated blank whole blood (see Biological
Matrices). The quality control concentrations were selected
to fit the low (quality control low concentration (QCLO)), medium
(medium concentration (QCMED)), and high (high concentration (QCHI))
ends of the calibration range. Additional controls included blank
water and blank whole blood. All standards and quality controls excluding
blank water were spiked with three internal standards to a final concentration
of 10.0 ng mL–1. The norfentanyl-d5 (stock of 100.0 μg mL–1), fentanyl-d5 (100.0 μg mL–1), and
acetyl fentanyl-13C6 (50.0 μg mL–1) working internal standards were prepared by 5–10-fold volumetric
dilution of stock internal standard to 100.0 ng mL–1 in methanol. 2H1 and 13C6 internal standards were selected for use due to their structural
similarity and physicochemical properties compared to those of the
IMFs. Fentanyl-d5 was used as the internal
standard for all IMF analogues without a stable, labeled internal
standard on the market due to the limited availability of most analogues
and the structural similarities to fentanyl. Controls (triplicate)
and calibration standards were extracted daily. Post extraction controls
(spiked after separation) and neat controls (directly evaporated and
not extracted) were also made for method validation purposes.

Biological
Matrices
Whole blood free of pathogens was
obtained from the Community Blood Center, Dayton, OH. Blank whole
blood was preserved with sodium fluoride (1%) and was refrigerated
(∼4 °C) or frozen (−10 to −20°C). Before
use, the acquired blood was analyzed for over 70 potential contaminants
and drugs of abuse (Table S1) by running
a blank sample through multiple extractions and quantifications. Verified
whole blood was diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio. Because of limited
blood supply, the product was diluted to extend the amount of blood
needed for each analysis; however, proficiency blind tests were carried
out to demonstrate accurate analyte quantitation for accreditation
purposes.

Sample Preparation and Solid Phase Extraction
Calibrants,
controls, and samples were treated the same throughout all experiments
for method validation. Briefly, 1.0 mL of whole blood was added to
4.0 mL of PBS and 2.0 mL of water in a 16 x 125 Pyrex Screw Cap Tube.
Each sample was then spiked with 100.0 μL of internal standard.
Calibrators and controls were administered to additional stock solutions, resulting
in seven calibration concentrations (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0,
and 50.0 ng mL–1) and three quality controls (0.35,
2.5, and 25.0 ng mL–1). Afterward, calibrants, controls,
and samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 rpm (1811g) for 10 min to remove particulate matter prior to SPE.

The isolation of IMFs was selectively achieved using CLEAN SCREEN
DAU columns (United Chemical Technologies Bristol, PA). Desired drugs
were selectively eluted by maintaining the pH of reagents and column
close to 6.0 through the addition of PBS buffer. Briefly, SPE columns
were preconditioned and activated with 3.0 mL of methanol, washed
with 3.0 mL of water, and conditioned to pH 6.0 with PBS. Slight positive
pressure (∼10 psi) was employed for each wash using a UCT Positive
Pressure Manifold.

Calibrants, controls, and samples were loaded
into the SPE columns,
which were then washed with 3.0 mL of water, 1.0 mL of 1.0 M of acetic
acid, and 3.0 mL of methanol to remove potential interferences. The
cationic IMFs were eluted with 3.0 mL of a v/v/v methylene chloride/isopropanol/ammonium
hydroxide mixture (78:20:2). The eluate was collected and evaporated
at 40 °C under a stream of air. Analytes were then reconstituted
with 100.0 μL of methanol and injected into LC-MS/MS.

Liquid
Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
Separation
of fentanyl analytes was achieved with a Raptor biphenyl
analytical column heated to 40 °C. Mobile phase A (MPA) consisted
of 10.0 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water. Mobile
phase B (MPB) was made of 0.1% formic acid in ACN. MPA and MPB were
held for 2 min at 90/10%. MPA was gradually ramped down from 90 to
10% over 6 min, then held for 0.5 min at 10/90%, and finally returned
to 90/10% in 0.1 min, and was held for the remainder of the time.
A total run time of 13.5 min ensured the elution of analytes and the
equilibration of the column.

Electrospray ionization in a positive
ion scan mode was selected for MS measurements. Source parameters
were maintained for nitrogen gas temperature (350 °C), gas flow
(12.0 L min–1), and capillary voltage (4000 V).
Detection was accomplished by using a dynamic MRM scan function. Precursor
and product ions were identified using the Optimizer software (Agilent)
and manual determination (Table 1).

LC-MS/MS Assay Validation
Validation followed method
development and occurred daily over 5 days. It included a batch of
seven calibrators, controls in triplicate, a negative blood blank,
and a water blank. The limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation
(LOQ), bias, precision (coefficient of variation, % CV), linearity,
matrix effects, recovery, carryover, and any potential interferences
were determined within the validation period.

Data Analysis
The software used for data analysis was
MassHunter Qualitative and Quantitative analysis. Data was plotted
in Excel 2016 and Origin 8 software.

The development of the
LC-MS/MS method required the adaptation of the following: (1) SPE
extractions for separation of the analytes of interest from interferences
inherent in biological matrices, (2) LC for further improvement in
sensitivity and specificity, and (3) MS/MS for MRM transitions specific
to each IMF analogue and analogue quantification at sub ng mL–1 concentrations.

SPE Extractions were performed
according to the United Chemical
Technologies extraction method (10.5)26 for N = 9 IMF analogues in urine (fentanyl, alfentanil,
carfentanil, sufentanil, 3-methyl fentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl,
α-methyl fentanyl, thianfentanil, and lofentanil). This gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method was
successfully adapted for the extraction of all N =
24 IMF analogues in whole blood specimens.

LC Optimization
First, two columns were tested: C-18
and biphenyl. The C-18 column proved inefficient for the separation
of all IMF analogues, whereas the biphenyl column was found to generate
an improved signal-to-noise ratio and separation. Thus, the biphenyl
column was selected for method validation. Three mobile phase mixtures
(methanol and formic acid, ammonium formate and formic acid in water
(MPA), and formic acid in ACN (MPB)) were explored to provide the
best separation of IMF analogues in the shortest amount of time. Exploratory
work deemed methanol and formic acid as unsuitable because separation
of IMF analogues could not be achieved within acceptable time frames
(<20 min) and corresponding chromatography exhibited poor signal-to-noise
ratios under the studied conditions. Following this, MPA and MPB mixtures
were deemed acceptable for a gradient method by achieving time efficient
separation (13.5 min). A flow rate of 0.400 mL min–1 was selected to accommodate the maximum column pressure on both
LC-MS/MS systems. The gradient change of mobile phases was then optimized
from 90% MPA/10% MPB to 10% MPA/90% MPB to achieve a total run time
of 13.5 min per sample and to avoid overloading the column (Figure S1).

MS/MS Optimization
Electrospray ionization mode paired
with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry was employed for MRM transitions,
which were optimized for high sensitivity of each IMF analogue. Briefly,
precursor-ion and product-ion transitions for each IMF analogue and
internal standards (Table 1) were mostly determined using the Agilent Optimizer software.
Manual adjustment of the fragmentor and collision energy voltage was
done when the software adjustment led to low sensitivity for the qualifier
transitions ((±)-cis-3-methyl fentanyl, U-47700,
and remifentanil). MRM transitions were identified by the highest
sensitivity and specific discrimination between coeluting analogues
(e.g., AH-7921 and U-47700 in Table 1). Separation and identification between butyryl fentanyl
and isobutyryl fentanyl and para-fluorobutyryl fentanyl
and 4-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl could not be achieved under current
conditions. Thus, they were classified as butyryl/isobutyryl and para-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl/para-fluorobutyryl
fentanyl. Using this method, the isomeric IMF analogues can be detected
but not distinguished from each other. Thus, Figure 2 shows only the quantitative transitions
of N = 22 fentanyl analogues and N = 3 internal standards. The acquisition method report is provided
in the Supporting Information.

fentanyl, (22) carfentanil, (23) para-fluorobutyryl/para-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl, (24) sufentanil, and (25)
valeryl fentanyl. Separation between butyryl/isobutyryl and para-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl/para-fluorobutyryl
fentanyl was not achieved due to isomerism.

Method Validation
The directed assay was validated
by determining the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation
(LOQ), selectivity and specificity, recovery, ion suppression/enhancement,
process efficiency, bias, and precision. All analyses were performed
after a 5 day validation period. LOD, lower limit of quantitation
(LLOQ), upper limit of quantitation, bias, and precision were calculated
over five replicates from five consecutive days.

Limit of Detection
(LOD)
LODs for IMF analogues are
listed in Table 2.
Evaluation of LOD for most IMF analogues (excluding fentanyl) was
carried out by using a linear calibration curve model. LOD was estimated
using eq 1 1  where sy is the
standard deviation of the y-intercept and Avgm is the average of the calibration slopes.

LOD of
fentanyl (quadratic fit, 1/x) was determined
by evaluating the calibration standards 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10 of the
lowest calibrator (i.e., 0.05, 0.025, and 0.01 ng mL–1) for the lowest fentanyl concentration with an acceptable signal-to-noise
ratio. The standard that exhibited a signal five times greater than
the background noise was then selected as the LOD for fentanyl.

Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)
LODs represent the lowest
quantity that can be distinguished from a blank, whereas LOQs define
our range of quantitation for the assay. The lowest limit of quantitation
(LLOQ) was chosen to be the lowest nonzero calibrator that demonstrated
acceptable bias and precision (<20, >80%), along with reproducible
chromatography. The upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) was selected
as the highest calibrator within the calibration range (i.e., 10.0
ng mL–1 for all IMF analogues except for fentanyl
and norfentanyl at 50.0 ng mL–1).

Selectivity/Specificity
All IMF analogues were evaluated
for endogenous and exogenous interferences. Endogenous interferences
were evaluated (N = 5) daily with whole blood previously
screening negative for targeted IMF analogues. Negative blanks were
extracted daily to assess false positive results due to potential
matrix interferences. All negative blanks revealed no interferences
were present that could result in a false positive identification.

Exogenous interferences were measured with solutions containing N = 70 commonly detected analytes in toxicology laboratories
(Table S1). Verification of selectivity
included extracting each commonly detected analyte at the concentration
level specified in Table S1 and spiking
with 0.35 ng mL–1 targeted IMF analytes in whole
blood. Specificity was addressed by analyzing all N = 70 nontargeted analytes in whole blood without the addition of
IMF analogues. False positives were not detected with nontargeted
analytes, but large concentrations of benzodiazepine (2500 ng mL–1) were found to interfere with AH-7921 and U-47700.
However, these concentrations are much larger than usually seen in
normal assays.

Recovery
SPE extraction recoveries
were determined
by analyzing post extraction spikes against regular extractions. Recoveries
were determined using LOCTRL, MEDCTRL, and HICTRL (N = 3). The average recoveries for LOCTRL, MEDCTRL, and HICTRL were
84 ± 19, 78 ± 12, and 94 ± 4.1%, respectively, for
all N = 21 nonisomeric IMF analogues (excluding butyryl/isobutyryl
fentanyl and para-fluorobutyryl/para-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl). Recovery ranges for LOCTRL, MEDCTRL,
and HICTRL were 38–140, 33–96, and 91–97%, respectively.
All recovery values can be found in Table S2.

Ionization Suppression/Enhancement (ISE)
Ion suppression
and enhancement (ISE) was evaluated using post extraction additions
that were compared with neat standards. The signal response exhibited
minor changes in most IMF analogues. Remifentanil acid exhibited the
lowest ISE (<45%). The detection of each analyte was not affected
by ISE. All ISE values can be found in Table S3.

Process Efficiency
The total process efficiency was
determined for each IMF analogue by comparison of neat standards against
regular extractions. The process efficiency for LOCTRL, MEDCTRL, and
HICTRL were 80 ± 13, 76 ± 12, and 89 ± 1.3%, respectively,
for all IMF analogues. Process efficiency ranges for LOCTRL, MEDCTRL,
and HICTRL were 45–104, 41–91, and 88–90%, respectively.
All process efficiency values can be found in Table S4.

Statistical quantitation of each IMF analogue
followed immediately after qualitative evaluation. Structural isomers
that coeluted with each other were only qualitatively determined.
Quantitative determination of drugs is normally important for toxicological
analyses; however, taking into account the paucity of data available
on IMFs, the qualitative identification of an IMF is more important
than its quantity. All other IMF analogues were evaluated for bias
and precision to meet acceptable criteria.28

Bias and Precision
Intra- and interday bias and precision
were assessed with the help of quality control samples containing
all IMF analogues (0.35, 2.5, and 25.0 ng mL–1 of
IMF analogues). Intraday bias and precision were expressed as the
largest calculated bias and precision for each of the 5 days of the
validation period. All other bias and precision values fell below
the maximum intraday value (Table 3). Any IMF analogue not meeting acceptable criteria
(bias < 20% and precision > 80%) was defined as qualitative
only.

Results
and Discussion
The LC-MS/MS method developed in this study
allows for the multiplex
detection of N = 24 IMF analytes with good sensitivity
and a short sample run time (13.5 min). Quantitated IMF analogues
(N = 13) passed all evaluations. These were norfentanyl,
butyryl norfentanyl, remifentanil, acetyl fentanyl, alfentanil, U-47700,
acetyl fentanyl 4-methylphenethyl, acrylfentanyl, fentanyl, para-methoxyfentanyl, furanyl fentanyl, carfentanil, and
valeryl fentanyl. All analytes had an LOD ≤ 0.100 ng mL–1 and a maximum LLOQ of 0.500 ng mL–1 (the lowest LLOQ value being 0.100 ng mL–1).

Casework
Since its development and validation in January
2017, the LC-MS/MS method was successfully utilized in the IMF analysis
of N = 725 blood samples at the Montgomery County
Coroner’s Office (MCCO) in Dayton, Ohio. The postmortem samples
were collected from accidental drug overdose death cases that occurred
between February 2015 and November 2016. The MCCO laboratory provides
postmortem forensic toxicology services to approximately 30 of Ohio’s
88 counties. The following N = 10 IMF analogues were
found to be present in the analyzed samples: (±)-cis-3-methyl fentanyl, 4-ANPP, acetyl fentanyl, carfentanil, despropionyl para-fluorofentanyl, fentanyl, furanyl fentanyl, furanyl
norfentanyl, norfentanyl, and U-47700. Table 4 summarizes the total number of times each
IMF analogue was detected across the N = 725 whole
blood samples. Fentanyl (N = 662, 91%) and its metabolite,
norfentanyl (N = 582, 80%), were the most commonly
encountered in the examined cases. Furthermore, N = 82 cases (11%) tested positive for 4-ANPP, which is an impurity
related to the synthesis of fentanyl and also a metabolite of fentanyl.
There were also 40 acetyl fentanyl (6%), 39 furanyl fentanyl (5%),
and 22 carfentanil (3%) positive cases.

The analysis of more
recent accidental overdose cases at MCCO laboratory
that occurred in between January and February 2017, identified N = 13 IMF analogues (fentanyl, acrylfentanyl, furanyl fentanyl,
carfentanil, norfentanyl, despropionyl fentanyl (4-ANPP), despropionyl para-fluorofentanyl, furanyl norfentanyl, acetyl fentanyl,
butyryl/isobutyryl fentanyl, butyryl norfentanyl, fluorobutyryl/fluoroisobutyryl
fentanyl, and U-47700).29

Figure 3 illustrates
the recent, multiplex detection of N = 8 IMF analogues
from a single whole blood sample at MCCO along with their corresponding
concentrations: norfentanyl (0.47 ng mL–1), U-47700
(0.50 ng mL–1), fentanyl (1.2 ng mL–1), and furanyl fentanyl (1.5 ng mL–1). Because
of cases like this, it is critical to incorporate such flexible methods
into the routine toxicological analysis at forensic laboratories worldwide.
A second manuscript is in production, in which N =
725 cases will be discussed in detail.

Several previous studies8−10,30−35 have already demonstrated the capabilities of the LC-MS/MS-based
analytical method in detecting IMF analogues, in the 0.050–0.500
ng mL–1 concentration range.10 However, the LOQ was determined to be the lowest calibrator
at 0.100 ng mL–1, which is equivalent to the LOQ
value of this study. To the best of our knowledge, these LC-MS/MS
studies on human blood detected at most N = 17 IMF
analogues and homologues with a 35 min scan time but without quantitation.30 Furthermore, those LC-MS/MS methods that offered
quantitation did not tackle more than N = 9 IMF analogues.35 As the frequency of opioid abuse cases is drastically
increasing both in the forensic and clinical world, both the qualitative
identification and quantitation of such analytes is becoming equally
important.36 The LC-MS/MS method of this
study will address this deficit by facilitating both the identification
(N = 22) and quantification (N =
13 for illustrative purposes) of IMF analogues and metabolites (total
of N = 24 of the most commonly encountered IMFs in
human blood) down to 0.100 ng mL–1, i.e., the lowest
LOQ reported to date according to our knowledge. Additionally, this
LC-MS/MS method can be easily adapted to accommodate newly emerging
IMFs in various drug analysis settings and with the shortest screening
time (13.5 min) under the studied conditions.

Other analytical
methods, such as gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS)37 and thermal
desorption direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry,38 have also been explored. Although successful
in the qualitative detection of N = 17 and quantitation
of N = 4 IMF analogues and metabolites, these methods
had greater LODs (0.08–0.351 ng mL–1) and
LLOQs (0.500 ng mL–1) than the ones described in
this LC-MS/MS method, namely, 0.017–0.050 and 0.100 ng mL–1, respectively, for all N = 13 quantitated
IMF analogues.

Conclusions
An LC-MS/MS-based method
was developed for the multiplex detection
of N = 24 IMF analogues and metabolites in postmortem
blood at sub ng mL–1 concentrations. It was successfully
implemented at the Montgomery County Coroner’s Office/Miami
Valley Regional Crime Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, where it aided in
the analysis of N = 725 postmortem blood samples
collected from accidental drug overdose death cases. This forensic
work demonstrated the cost- and time-efficiency of the newly developed
IMF detection method. In addition to employing commercially available,
inexpensive supplies and common forensic instrumentation, the method
requires 13.5 min scan time for a single sample and 5–10 min
for quantitative and qualitative analysis. The LC-MS/MS-based protocol
can be easily adapted by forensic laboratories worldwide; it is currently
undergoing modifications to incorporate the addition of four new IMF
analogues (β-hydroxythiofentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl,
tetrahydrofuran fentanyl, and cyclopropyl fentanyl) at the Montgomery
County Coroner’s Office.
