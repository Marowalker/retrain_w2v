In this paper, the
adsorption properties
of wheat straw (WS) and corn straw (CS) for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in
solution were studied. The effects of adsorption time, pH of the solution,
temperature, and initial concentration of metal ions on adsorption
capacity were investigated. The adsorption mechanism was discussed.
The results showed that the adsorption isotherms of WS and CS for
Cr(VI) and Cr(III) satisfied the Langmuir equation. By fitting the
Langmuir equation, the saturated adsorption capacity of WS for Cr(VI)
and Cr(III) can reach 125.6 and 68.9 mg g–1, and
that of CS for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) can reach 87.4 and 62.3 mg g–1 , respectively. The adsorption kinetics conformed
to the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation. The effect of temperature
on the adsorption capacity was not significant. Physical diffusion
and chemical adsorption coexist in the process of adsorption of metal
ions by straws, and chemical adsorption is dominant, and the effect
of physical diffusion on the chemical adsorption rate can be neglected.
It can be seen from the experimental results that the treatment of
chromium-containing wastewater by using cheap and easily available
wheat straw and corn straw had a remarkable effect. The adsorbed straw
could be completely desorbed and had excellent recyclability, indicating
that the straws are ideal adsorbents.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Wastewater from mining
and smelting of chromium, manufacture and plating of chromium salts,
metal processing, tanning, paints, pigments, printing, and dyeing
contains a large amount of Cr(VI). Natural activities such as volcanic
eruptions and weathering of rocks can also cause chromium emissions.
Therefore, chromium exists in water and soil environments for a long
time, leading to serious environmental pollution and affecting human
health.1−3 The methods
of precipitation,4 membrane filtration,5 amine solvent extraction,6 ion exchange,7 adsorption,8 electrodeposition,9 and various other biological processes10−12 are usually used to treat chromium-containing
wastewater. Among them, adsorption is the most common method. The
biosorption method is widely used because of its low cost, high efficiency,
stability, and good selectivity to different heavy metal ions.13,14

China is one of the countries with the most abundant straw
resources in the world. The annual total output of straw resources
in China is 600–700 million tons, and the utilization rate
is 60–70%.15 The comprehensive utilization
and recycling of straw is one of the most important topics in China.
Rational utilization of straw will become a necessary trend for future
environmental protection and sustainable development strategies.16,17

First, the surface of the straw is rough, the cell wall capillary
structure is internal, the porosity is high, and the surface area
is large. These structures are favorable for the physical adsorption
of pollutants.18,19 Second, the straw body is generally
composed of macromolecules such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin,
and protein, which consist of C, H, O, N, and S. These macromolecules
contain functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups.
These functional groups have strong coordination ability.20,21 Therefore, the straw has a strong chemical adsorption capacity and,
in particular, adsorbs heavy metal ions having an electronic structure
capable of forming a coordinate bond.22 Compared with other traditional methods for treating pollutants
in water, it has the advantages of good structural performance, large
specific surface areas, high removal efficiency, abundant sources,
low costs, and less secondary pollution.23 A large number of the literature have confirmed that the use of
modified straw as an adsorbent for the removal of water pollutants
is a good way to utilize straw resources, which not only improves
the utilization rate of straw but also opens up a new water-pollution
treatment mode.24−26 Therefore,
the development and utilization of straw-based adsorbents has important
practical significance.27

In this
paper, wheat and corn straw were selected as research objects, and
their adsorption characteristics for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) were studied.
Surface properties such as surface functional groups and pore structures
of biomass carbon were analyzed. They are expected to provide a scientific
basis for the efficient treatment of heavy metal pollution by biochar
and also open up new ways for the rational development and recycling
of straw.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
Wheat straw and corn straw,
K2Cr2O7 (AR, Tianjin Fuchen Chemical
Reagent Factory), and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (AR, Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent
Factory). All other chemicals were of analytical grade.

2.2 Preparation of Adsorbents
The straws were washed by
distilled water, dried in air, and cut
into 1 to 2 cm length. They were then ground in a ball mill, sieved
to particle sizes of 100 mesh, and placed in a desiccator for later
use.

2.3 Characterization
of Adsorbents
The materials were analyzed using a Tensor
27 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Bruker Company, Germany), scanning electron
microscope (SEM, Hitachi, Japan), X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D2-PHASER, Dandong Haoyuan Instrument Co., Ltd.China), Rario
type II elemental analyzer (Elementary, Germany), BET specific surface
meter (3H-2000PS1,Beijing,China), and an instrument of microelectrophoresis
(JS94H, Shanghai Zhong Chen Digital Technology Equipment Co., Ltd).

2.4 Batch Adsorption Experiment
An amount of
0.2 g of adsorbents was placed in a solution containing
one metal ion for adsorption, and the adsorption properties of straw
on Cr(VI) and Cr(III) were studied under noncompetitive conditions.
All the adsorption experiments were carried out upon stirring at 200
rpm in an orbital shaker for 12 h at 25 °C. The adsorbed mixture
was separated by membrane filtration of 0.2 μm, and the filtrates
were collected to measure the final ion concentration by atomic absorption
spectrophotometry (AAS). The adsorption capacity at equilibrium (Qe, expressed in mg g–1) was
calculated by eq 1. 1  where Qe is the equilibrium adsorption
capacity (mg g–1), C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium
metal ion concentrations (mg L–1), respectively, V is the solution volume (L), and m is
the mass of the dried straws (g).

The impact of the solution
pH on the metal adsorption was investigated with the initial pH of
the solutions ranging from 1.0 to 7.0 and the initial concentration
of metal ion of 200 mg L–1.

The adsorption
isotherm experiments were conducted in solution at a pH 3.0 for Cr(VI)
and pH 5.0 for Cr(III) with the initial metal ion concentration varied
from 25 to 300 mg L–1 at 25, 35, 45, and 55 °C.
Adsorption isotherms were obtained by plotting Qe versus Ce. The Langmuir (eq 2) and Freundlich (eq 3) equations were used to
fit the adsorption isotherms of straw for Cr(VI) and Cr(III). 2   3  where Qe is the adsorption
capacity (mg g–1), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of metal ions (mg L–1), Q0 is the saturated adsorption capacity
(mg g–1), KC is the
Langmuir constant (L mg–1), KF is an empirical parameter (mg1–1/n L–1/n g–1), and n is the Freundlich constant.

In the
case of the adsorption kinetic experiments, the pH of the initial
solution was fixed to 3.0 for Cr(VI) and 5.0 for Cr(III), and the
initial concentration of metal ions was 200 mg L–1. Samples were collected at different time intervals. The kinetic
curve was obtained by a plot of Qe versus
adsorption time. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model (eq 4), pseudo-second-order kinetic model
(eq 5), and intraparticle
diffusion model (eq 6) proposed by Weber and Morris28 were
used to fit the adsorption kinetic data. 4   5   6  where t is the adsorption time (min), k2 is the adsorption rate constant (min–1), K1 is the Lagergren rate constant (min–1) of the adsorption, Kid is the intraparticle
diffusion rate constant (mmol g–1/min0.5), and Qt and Qe are the adsorption amount at given time t and equilibrium time, respectively.

The R2 value of the linear equation is used to judge the degree
of fitting of the adsorption kinetic model and isothermal adsorption
model.

2.5 Recycling
Experiments
The Cr(VI)-loaded straws and Cr(III)-loaded straws
were regenerated with 1 M KOH solution and 0.1 M HNO3 solution,
respectively, then collected by filtration, washed with distilled
water, and reused in the next cycle of adsorption experiments.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of Adsorbents
3.1.1 Physical and Chemical
Properties of Straw
Table 1 shows the chemical composition, elemental composition,
and pore structure parameters of straws. Straws are composed of macromolecules
such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and protein, which are composed
of elements such as C, H, O, and N. These macromolecules contain functional
groups such as hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, and amino groups
with strong coordination ability. Therefore, straws possess strong
ability of chemical adsorption. It can be seen from the pore structure
parameters of straw that the straw has high porosity and a large surface
area, which is beneficial to the physical adsorption of pollutants.29

3.1.2 Analysis of SEM
The photo and SEM of the straws are
shown in Figure 1.
The straws have a rough surface, and there are cell wall capillary
structures inside the straws. The structure of the straws is loose,
which can expose more active sites and is more conducive to the chemical
adsorption. At the same time, it can be seen that there are more small
pores distributed in the loose pores of the straw, which is beneficial
to increase the specific surface area.

CS (taken by Y.C.) and SEM of (c) WS and (d) CS.

3.1.3 Analysis
of FT-IR
The IR spectrum
of straw is shown in Figure 2. It can be seen from Figure 2 that there are a large number of surface functional
groups in the straw, and these surface functional groups may play
a very important role in the process of adsorbing heavy metal ions.
Wheat straw has a strong absorption peak in 3412, 1702, 1615, 1273,
1097, and 950 cm–1 (Figure 2a). The broad peak near 3412 cm–1 is a stretching vibration of a hydroxyl group (−OH). The
peak at 1702 cm–1 is the characteristic absorption
peak of an ester (C=O). The peak at 1615 cm–1 represents the stretching vibration of C=C in the aromatic
ring. The bending vibration absorption peak of the phenolic hydroxyl
group is at 1273 cm–1.The peaks near 1097 and 929
cm–1 are the stretching vibrations of C–O
and C–H, respectively. The infrared spectrum of corn straw
is shown in Figure 2b. Among them, 3420 cm–1 is the stretching vibration
absorption peak of the phenolic hydroxyl group and amino group in
proteins. The peak at 1720 cm–1 is the stretching
vibration peak of the carboxyl group. The bending vibration peak of
the hydroxyl group is at 1383 cm–1. The peak at
1250 cm–1 represents the plane vibration absorption
peak of hydroxyl in cellulose.

3.1.4 Analysis
of ζ Potential
The ζ
potential means that the charged particles attract the oppositely
charged particles in the dispersion, and the ions near the surface
of the particle are strongly bound, and the ions farther away form
a difference between the internal and external potentials of a loose
electron cloud. A large number of polar groups exist on the surface
of the straw, and when it is dispersed in solution, a certain amount
of ions can be adsorbed on the surface of the straw to form an electric
double layer, thereby generating a ζ potential.

The pH−ζ
potential curves of WS and CS samples are presented in Figure 3. It can be seen that the ζ
potential values of wheat straw and corn decrease as pH increases.
This can be explained by the mechanism of variable charge generation.
Due to the presence of pH-dependent functional groups (such as hydroxyl
and carboxyl groups) in WS and CS, the surface positive charge of
CS and WS decreases, while the surface negative charge increases with
the increase of pH. The hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the surface
are protonated under acidic conditions, resulting in the enhancement
of positive charge in WS and CS. As the pH increases, these groups
will exhibit a greater negative charge and result in the decrease
of the positive charge in WS and CS.

pH values.

3.2 Adsorption
Property
3.2.1 Effect of pH on Adsorption
Figure 4 shows the effect
of solution pH on Cr(VI) and Cr(III) adsorption. The pH value of the
solution affects the form of Cr(VI) and has a certain effect on the
activity of the functional groups on the adsorbent. With the increase
of pH, the adsorption amount of wheat straw and corn straw for Cr(VI)
increased slowly and then decreased rapidly. When the pH is low, Cr(VI)
mainly exists in the form of HCrO4– and
Cr2O72–, and these ions are
easily adsorbed to the protonated adsorption site by electrostatic
attraction, and the surface of the adsorbent is surrounded by a large
amount of hydrogen ions, thereby increasing the attraction between
the Cr(VI) and adsorbent surface bonding sites. As the pH increases,
the concentration of OH– increases and induces competitive
adsorption with Cr2O72–, resulting
in a decrease in adsorption capacity. With the increase of the pH
value, the adsorption capacity of wheat straw and corn straw for Cr(III)
increased gradually. This may be because, at lower pH conditions,
protonation in the solution gives the material a positive charge,
while Cr(III) also has a positive charge, which affects the adsorption
capacity of the adsorbent for Cr(III). As the pH value of the solution
increases, OH– on the surface of the adsorbent increases,
and the adsorbent can adsorb Cr(III) through a surface metal reaction,
proton reaction, and complexation reaction. At higher pH, Cr undergoes
a hydrolysis reaction. The higher the pH is, the stronger the hydrolysis
is, which weakens the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for Cr(III)
in the solution. Therefore, pH 3.0 and 5.0 were selected as the optimum
pH for subsequent adsorption of Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively.

Figure 4 Effect of pH
on the adsorption of WS and CS for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) (initial concentration:
200 mg L–1; 25 °C; adsorbent dose: 0.2 g).

3.2.2 Effect of Temperature
on Adsorption
Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the adsorption of Cr(VI)
and Cr(III). It can be seen from Figure 5 that the adsorption capacity of WS and CS
for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) increased with the increase of temperature.
The adsorption capacity improved with increasing temperature, probably
due to the chemical interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate,
which created a new adsorption site under high-temperature conditions
or accelerated the internal diffusion rate of metal ions into the
pores of the adsorbent. However, as can be seen from Figure 5, the adsorption capacity did
not change significantly with temperature.

of temperature on the adsorption of WS and CS for Cr(VI) and Cr(III)
(pH 3.0 for Cr(VI), pH 5.0 for Cr(III); contact time: 12 h; adsorbent
dose: 0.2 g).

3.2.3 Adsorption
Isotherms
Figure 6 showed the adsorption isotherm
for adsorption of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) by wheat straw and corn straw
at 25 °C. With the increase of the equilibrium concentration
in the system, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of wheat straw
and corn straw for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) increased gradually, and it
stabilized when the equilibrium mass concentration was 100 mg L–1.

and Cr(III)
at 25 °C (pH 3.0 for Cr(VI), pH 5.0 for Cr(III); contact time:
12 h; adsorbent dose: 0.2 g).

The adsorption isotherm parameters fitted
by the Langmuir and Freundlich models are shown in Table 2. The adsorption of wheat straw
and corn straw for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) can better conform to the Langmuir
model. Therefore, the adsorption of WS and CS for Cr(VI) and Cr(III)
belongs to monolayer adsorption.

3.2.4 Adsorption
Kinetics
The dynamic adsorption
effect of the adsorbent was investigated, as shown in Figure 7. It can be seen from Figure 7 that the adsorption
process of the straw for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) was divided into two stages.
The adsorption rate was very fast at 0–5 h, while the adsorption
rate was slowed down after 5 h, and the adsorption capacity reached
equilibrium after about 12 h.

Cr(III) at 25 °C (initial concentration:200 mg L–1; pH 3.0 for Cr(VI), pH 5.0 for Cr(III); adsorbent dose: 0.2 g).

The pseudo-first-order kinetic
equation, pseudo-second order kinetic equation, and intraparticle
diffusion equation were used to fit the adsorption kinetics of the
process, and the kinetic mechanism was analyzed. The fitting parameters
are shown in Table 3.

R2	0.957	0.948	0.962	0.971	
It can be seen from Table 3 that the fitting effect of the pseudo-second-order
kinetic equation was better than that of the pseudo-first-order kinetic
equation and intraparticle diffusion equation, and the correlation
coefficient R2 reaches 0.99. When R2 > 0.980, the model is considered to be
suitable for describing the dynamics of the adsorption process. In
addition, the equilibrium adsorption capacity obtained by fitting
the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation was closer to the equilibrium
adsorption capacity obtained in the experiment. Therefore, the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model can better reflect the adsorption process of straws
for Cr(VI) and Cr(III).

According to the mechanism established
by the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation, it can be inferred that
physical diffusion and chemical adsorption coexist in the process
of adsorption of metal ions by straws, and chemical adsorption is
dominant, and the effect of physical diffusion on the chemical adsorption
rate can be neglected.

3.2.5 Adsorption Thermodynamics
Thermodynamic parameters
such as free energy change (ΔG), enthalpy change
(ΔH), and entropy change (ΔS) can provide in-depth information about the inherent energy change
related to adsorption, which can be calculated using eqs 7–9, respectively 7   8   9  where R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1), T is the
absolute temperature (K), and KC is the
adsorption equilibrium constant.

The results are shown in Table 4. The negative value
of ΔG indicated that the adsorption of Cr(VI)
and Cr(III) on WS and CS was a spontaneous process. The thermodynamic
data of ΔH and ΔS proved
the endothermic nature of the process and the increase of randomness
at the solid/liquid interface, indicating that the temperature is
a favorable factor for the adsorption kinetics. In the temperature
range studied, TΔS accounted
for a large proportion of the total free energy, indicating that the
increase of entropy during ion binding was an important factor to
promote the interaction between metal ions and straws.

3.2.6 Reusability
To explore
the desorption and reusability of straws, 1 M KOH and 0.1 M HNO3 were used as eluants to carry out the recycle experiment
for Cr(VI)-loaded straws and Cr(III)-loaded straws, respectively.
As shown in Figure 8, there was no significant change in the adsorption capacities of
WS and CS during the repeated adsorption–desorption, indicating
that the straws had excellent reusability.

4 Conclusions
In this work,
the adsorption properties of wheat straw and corn straw for Cr(VI)
and Cr(III) in solution were investigated. Pseudo-second-order and
Langmuir adsorption isotherm models can preferably describe the adsorption
process. The saturated adsorption capacity of WS for Cr(VI) and Cr(III)
can reach 125.6 and 68.9 mg g–1, and that of CS
for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) can reach 87.4 and 62.3 mg g–1 , respectively. The straws possess excellent reusability. These
results indicate that wheat straw and corn straw might serve as an
efficient, simple, and low-cost material for heavy metal-ion removal
from wastewaters. This research has theoretical and practical significance
for the development and application of adsorbents based on agricultural
straws. It also has a positive effect on solving the problem of heavy
metal pollution in water and the problem of environmental pollution
and safety caused by improper disposal of agricultural wastes.
