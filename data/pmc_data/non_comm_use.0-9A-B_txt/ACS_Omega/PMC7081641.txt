Organometallic
sandwich complexes, composed of cyclic hydrocarbon
ligands and transition-metal atoms, display unique physical and chemical
properties. In this work, the electronic and spin transport properties
of one-dimensional (1D) VBz2 ligand bimetallic sandwich
complexes, VBz2–TM (TM = Cr, Mn, and Fe), are systematically
investigated using density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green’s
function method. The results show that all the 1D infinite molecular
wires [(VBz2)TM]∞ (TM = Cr–Fe)
are found to be thermodynamically stable with high binding energies
(∼1.0–3.45 eV). In particular, they are predicted to
be ferromagnetic half metals. Moreover, the I–V curves exhibit negative differential resistance for one,
two, and three VBz2–TM wires at TM = Cr, Mn, and
Fe, respectively, which is of great significance for certain electronic
applications. Our findings strongly suggest that the benzene ligand
bimetallic sandwich molecular wires are good candidates for potential
electronics and spintronics.

Introduction
Since the discovery of ferrocene,1 organometallic
sandwich complexes, composed of metal atoms and π-conjugated
ligands, have been inspiring ongoing interests because of their excellent
electronic and magnetic properties and have become promising candidates
for the next generation of electronic and spintronic devices. To date,
various organometallic sandwich complexes,2−55 incorporating organic–monocyclic–hydrocarbon ligands
such as Bz(=C6H6),2−21 Cp(=C5H5),20−25 COT(=C8H8),26−30 and so forth and organic–polycyclic–hydrocarbon
ligands such as Np(=C10H6),31,32 Pn(=C8H6),33,34 coronene (=C24H12),35 and so forth, have been exemplified; besides, the metal
atoms include the 3d transition-metal (TM) atoms and 4f lanthanide
metal (Ln) atoms and so forth. In addition, such organometallic sandwich
configurations consisting of bimetallic atoms24,25 or mixed organic ligands20 are also extensively
addressed because of their tunable electronic and magnetic properties.
Recently, the one-dimensional (1D) metal trihydride molecular nanowire
MH3 (M = Sc, Cr, Mn, and Co) has been shown to have versatile
magnetic properties, and the CoH3 nanowire shows the properties
of a half metal (HM).36

Among the
various organometallic sandwich complexes, vanadium(V)–Bz
compounds are one of the most extensively studied systems. Experimentally,
a stable V6Bz7 molecular chain as long as seven
layers was successfully synthesized by the laser vaporization method.5 Theoretically, Wang et al. investigated an achiral
to chiral structure transition for VnBzn+1 at n = 4,7,8 which is due to spectral broadening and appearance of new spectra.8 Besides, multilayer VnBzn+1 sandwich clusters were predicted
to be of great stability, and, in particular, VBz2 is experimentally
shown to possess ultrahigh stabilities with high ionization energy.4,9 The Stern–Gerlach experiment revealed that the magnetic moments
of VnBzn+1 (n = 1–4) are size-dependent at T = 154 and 296 K,6 which are
well elucidated by later density functional theory (DFT) calculation.7 Using the DFT calculation, Xiang et al.18 found that the 1D [VBz]∞ wire
is a robust ferromagnetic (FM) HM. Maslyuk et al.19 revealed that it is the direct exchange interaction between
V atoms, leading to the FM ground state. Interestingly, such robust
FM behaviors can also be conserved in the TM-stacked benzimidazole
(Bzim)-modified single-stranded DNA structures.52 Furthermore, coupling a finite VnBzn+1 sandwich wire to magnetic
(Ni(001) or Co(001)) electrodes makes it act as a nearly perfect molecular
spin filter.19 Moreover, high spin polarizations
can be achieved to spin transport through the family of molecular
systems the benzene–vanadium clusters sandwiched between carbon
nanotube electrodes.53

On the other
hand, the electronic and magnetic properties of the
bimetallic multilayer sandwich complexes have more significant advantages
via varying the organic ligands, metallic atoms, and so on. For example,
the magnetic moments of TMn(FeCp2)n+1 (TM = Ti, V, and Mn) are found to
increase linearly with their size.24 1D
[CpTiCpTM]∞ (TM = Cr and Fe), [CpCrCpTM]∞ (TM = Fe and Co), and [CpFeCpCo]∞ biorganometallic
sandwich molecular wires (BOSMWs) are robust FM HMs.25 Moreover, the amplitude and sign of the spin filter efficiency
(SFE) of (CpFeCpV)n multidecker sandwich
clusters were investigated to be varied by choosing the contact condition.54 Analogous to FeCp2, VBz2 is shown to be quite stable and can act as the building block to
bond with other TM atoms forming stable bimetallic sandwich configurations.
In our previous study, we investigated that 1D [BzVBzTM]∞ (TM = Sc, Ti, and Cr–Ni) molecular wires show rich electronic
and magnetic properties depending on the choice of TM atoms.14 In this work, we systematically investigate
the spin transport behaviors of 1D [(VBz2)TM]∞ (TM = Cr–Fe) BOSMWs. Our results indicate that the bonding
between “VBz2” and all the TM atoms in these
1D molecular wires is rather stable. Furthermore, all the studied
1D [(VBz2)TM]∞ (TM = Cr–Fe) BOSMWs
are FM HMs. Interestingly, the I–V curves exhibit negative differential resistance (NDR) for one, two,
and three 1D VBz2–TM molecular wires at TM = Cr,
Mn, and Fe, respectively, which is of great significance for certain
electronic devices, such as rectifier diodes.

Results and Discussion
The optimized lattice parameters for 1D [(VBz2)Cr]∞ BOSMW is 7.24 Å, which is a bit longer than that
of its 1D [(FeCp2)Cr]∞ analogue (7.16
Å).24 In contrast, the lattice parameters
of 1D [(VBz2)Mn]∞ and [(VBz2)Fe]∞ BOSMWs are 7.02 and 6.92Å, respectively,
much shorter than their [(FeCp2)Mn]∞(7.22
Å) and [(FeCp2)V]∞ (7.46 Å)
analogues.24 The distances of V or other
TMs to the mass center of Bz rings in these 1D [(VBz2)TM]∞ BOSMWs are 1.722 Å/1.909 Å, 1.674 Å/1.841
Å, and 1.688 Å/1.782 Å at TM = Cr, Mn and Fe, respectively.
Moreover, the TM-Bz (including V-Bz) distances in these bimetallic
systems are slightly larger than that in [VBz]∞.18,19 The stabilities of such 1D [(VBz2)TM]∞ BOSMWs are evaluated by calculating the binding energies with the
following equation 1  where E[ ] is the total energy
of the molecular wires, VBz2 molecule, and TM atoms, respectively.
The binding energies of these studied 1D [(VBz2)TM]∞ BOSMWs are 1.0, 1.27, and 3.45 eV for TM = Cr, Mn,
and Fe, respectively, which is slightly smaller than that of the 1D
[(FeCp2)TM]∞ analogues.24 As shown in the density of state (DOS) plot in Figure 1a, all the 1D BOSMWs
display a striking feature of combining a metallic (spin down) and
semiconducting gap (spin up) at different spin channels, indicating
that they are robust FM HMs, and such a result is similar to that
of [VBz]∞18,19 and our previous predicted
BOSMWs.14,25

Scheme of (VBz2)TM(VBz2) cluster connected to
two Au(100) electrodes. Here, vertical solid lines present the borders
of the central scattering region.

To calculate the electron transport properties through finite VBz2–TM molecular wires, we sandwich four types of clusters
having different lengths and anchoring ends: (i) (VBz2)TM,
(ii) (VBz2)TMBz, (iii) (VBz2)TMBzV, and (iv)
(VBz2)TM(VBz2) (TM = Cr, Fe, and Mn), between
two Au(100) electrodes (see Figure 1b). The distances between different terminated ends
and Au(100) surfaces are around 2.60–2.70 Å, varying slightly
within 0.05 Å. To quantify the transmission spin polarization,
we calculate the SFE as 2  where Tmaj(EF) and Tmin(EF) indicate the transmission coefficient of
the majority and minority spin channel around the Fermi level, respectively.
As shown in Table 1, the absolute value of SFEs for such 1D (VBz2)–TM
molecular wires are in the range of 92–100%, in which the highest
SFE is found for (VBz2)Cr, (VBz2)Mn(VBz2), and (VBz2)Fe(VBz2), respectively,
∼100%, and the least one is for (VBz2)FeBzV, ∼92%.
Our results indicate that all the studied 1D VBz2–TM
molecular wires act as robust spin filters independent of the molecular
chain lengths, which are better than those of the FeCp2–V bimetallic wires, whose SFE is found to be sensitive to
the choice of the contact condition.54 In
the case of VBz2–Cr complexes, the V–Au or
Cr–Au contact is strong for spin-up transport, while the Bz–Au
contact prefers spin-down transport (see Table 1), showing that the transport behaviors are
sensitive to the contact sites. In contract, different cases are envisioned
for the VBz2–Mn and VBz2–Fe combinations,
in which both contacts prefer the spin-down transport. On the other
hand, such spin transport characters of these VBz2 ligand
BOSMWs are different from those [(FeCp2)V]n analogues.54

To further understand the spin transport
characteristics of these
1D VBz2–TM systems, we plot the transmission spectra
for different contact configurations in Figures 2 and 3. As shown in Figure 2a–d, the transport
behaviors through (VBz2)Cr and (VBz2)CrBzV clusters
under the small bias voltage are mainly determined by the transmission
peak originated from the perturbed highest occupied molecular orbitals
(HOMO) of the spin-up channel, while in the case of (VBz2)CrBz and (VBz2)Cr(VBz2), the peak of the spin-down
channel is dominant around the Fermi level. Also, it should be noted
that the narrow peaks for the above two systems appear alternately
in both spin-up and spin-down channels, indicating that the spin-up
or spin-down transport can be realized by shifting the Fermi level.
As shown in Figure 2e–h, wider spin-down peaks are found to cross the Fermi level
for different VBz2–Mn arrangements, showing that
they have a stable spin transport channel. Similar results can also
be found for the 1D [(VBz2)Fe]∞ system
(see Figure 3). Moreover,
the electronic transport behaviors are slightly affected by the chain
lengths, which are consistent with the HM properties of 1D [(VBz2)TM]∞ BOSMWs.

Figure 2 (a–h) Spin-resolved
transmission spectra of (VBz2)TM, (VBz2)TMBz,
(VBz2)TMBzV, and (VBz2)TM(VBz2) (TM
= Cr, Mn), respectively.

transmission spectra of (VBz2)Fe, (VBz2)FeBz,
(VBz2)FeBzV, and (VBz2)Fe(VBz2),
respectively.

The I–V curves for various
finite VBz2–TM molecular wires coupled between two
Au(100) electrodes are shown in Figure 4, and different shapes of the I–V curves are identified. For (VBz2)Cr, striking
NDR features appear at around 0.4 V bias voltage. Interestingly, similar
NDRs are also found for (VBz2)MnBzV, (VBz2)Mn(VBz2), (VBz2)Fe, (VBz2)FeBzV, and (VBz2)Fe(VBz2). This behavior has gained widespread
interest because the NDR is necessary for several electronic components,
such as the Esaki and resonant tunneling diodes.55,56 Finally, we come to the different molecule–electrode coupling
for spin-up electrons and spin-down electrons between these VBz2–TM (TM = Cr, Mn and Fe) systems. Taking (VBz2)Cr and (VBz2)Fe as examples, we present their lowest
unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), HOMO, and the secondary HOMO
(HOMO-1) of the spin-up channel and spin-down channel in Table 2. For (VBz2)Cr, the LUMO and HOMO orbitals are localized in both spin-up and
spin-down channels, particularly the spin-down electron states, which
correspond to the small transmission spectra in the spin-up channel
and zero transmission spectra in the spin-down channel, showing that
the spin-down electron does not contribute to the electronic transport.
While for (VBz2)Fe, the spin-up LUMO and HOMO orbitals
are localized and does not contribute to the transport; in contrast,
the spin-down LUMO and HOMO orbitals extend into both electrodes and
induces transmission spectra in Figure 3a, which contribute to spin transmission at the Fermi
level.

Conclusions
In summary, we systematically
investigated the structural, electronic,
and spin transport behaviors of 1D [(VBz2)TM]∞ (TM = Cr, Fe, and Mn) BOSMWs by DFT and nonequilibrium Green’s
function (NEGF) techniques. All the 1D [(VBz2)TM]∞ BOSMWs are energetically stable and are robust FM HMs. Moreover,
six VBz2–TM clusters with different lengths and
terminals possess NDR, which is essential for electronic applications.
Our results indicate that the VBz2–TM combinations
display good spin transport behaviors and are potential in future
spintronic applications.

Computational Method
The structure
optimizations and electronic properties are investigated
within the framework of spin-polarized density functional theory as
implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.57,58 The exchange–correlation potentials are treated by the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerholf.59 The interaction between valence electrons and
ion cores is described by the projector augmented wave method.60,61 In our previous studies, we noted that both GGA and GGA + U schemes make negligible difference on the structural,
electronic, and magnetic properties for these 3d TM organometallic
systems;20,25 here, we will discuss the results based
on the GGA calculations in the whole work. In addition, the DFT-D2
method was adopted in all calculations to take into account the van
der Waals interaction.62 For 1D infinite
[(VBz2)TM]∞ wires, periodic boundary
conditions are applied along the TM–Bz axis within the unit
cell containing two TM atoms and two Bz molecules (Figure 1a, red dotted line). To avoid
the interaction of the nanowires from the adjacent unit cell, the
vacuum space opposite to the periodic direction is set as large as
20 Å. The energy cutoff for the plane wave function is 400 eV.
Numerical convergence was achieved with a tolerance of 10–6
eV in energy, and the force acting on each atom is less than 0.01
eV/Å. The ions in the periodic unit are allowed to fully relax.
The Gaussian smearing technique of width 0.01 eV was used. The reciprocal
space is sampled by 1 × 1 × 15 Monkhorst–Pack k-points mesh grids for the geometric optimization, and
a much denser k-point grid (1 × 1 × 45)
is used for the electronic structure calculation.

The spin transport
simulation is carried out with the help of Atomistix
Toolkit package.63,64 The system is described by DFT
with the standard nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotential, and the
quantum spin transmission is evaluated by the NEGF technique.64,65 The wave functions are expanded on a numerical basis set of double-ζ
plus polarization for TM atoms and single-ζ plus polarization
for other atoms. The convergent results are achieved by using the
Monck Horst–Pack grid with 100 k-points in
the 1D Brillouin zone. The two-probe system can be divided into three
parts, the scattering region, left electrode, and right electrode.
To provide that the charge distribution in left and right electrodes
are the same as that of the bulk phase, the scattering region is constructed
by a VBz2–TM cluster and two(three) surface layers
of the left(right) electrodes by including the screening effects in
the contact region. The Au(100) surface is represented by a (4 ×
4) primitive cell with periodic boundary conditions. To obtain the
appropriate distance of the two-probe structural model, the distance
between the central cluster and the electrode has been optimized by
fixing the cluster and the electrode.
