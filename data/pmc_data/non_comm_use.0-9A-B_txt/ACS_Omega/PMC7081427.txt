G-quadruplexes have
important biologic functions that are regulated
by G-quadruplex-binding proteins. In particular, G-quadruplex structures
are folded or unfolded by their binding proteins and affect transcription
and other biologic functions. Here, we investigated the effect of
the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and arginine–glycine–glycine
repeat (RGG) domain of nucleolin on G-quadruplex formation. Our findings
indicate that Phe in the RGG domain of nucleolin is responsible for
G-quadruplex binding and folding. Moreover, the RRM of nucleolin potentially
binds to a guanine-rich single strand and folds the G-quadruplex with
a 5′-terminal and 3′-terminal single strand containing
guanine. Our findings contribute to our understanding of how the RRM
and RGG domains contribute to G-quadruplex folding and unfolding.

Introduction
G-quadruplexes in DNA
and RNA have important biologic roles, such
as regulation of transcription, translation, DNA replication, telomere
elongation, and histone modification.1−3 Each function of G-quadruplexes
is thought to be regulated by G-quadruplex-binding proteins.4 Some of these binding proteins, including heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1), nucleolin, cold-inducible
mRNA-binding protein (CIRBP), translocated in liposarcoma (also known
as fused in sarcoma, TLS/FUS), and Ewing’s sarcoma (EWS), have
common nucleic-acid-binding domains, such as the RNA recognition motif
(RRM) and arginine–glycine–glycine repeat (RGG) domain.5−11 Previous bioinformatic analysis revealed that the RGG domain is
an evolutionarily conserved sequence and at least 31 different protein
isoforms contain the domain.12,13 The RRM is one of the
most highly conserved nucleic-acid-binding domains, presenting in
approximately 0.5–1% of human genes and comprising one four-stranded
antiparallel β-sheet and two α-helixes packed against
the β-sheet.14,15 The RGG domain with the RRM of
hnRNP A1 and nucleolin is a G-quadruplex-binding domain.5−7 hnRNP A1 and its derivative UP1 are involved in telomere maintenance
and transcription, and nucleolin regulates transcription, translation
of G-quadruplex-containing regions, and suppression of virus replication.16−24 Furthermore, nucleolin interacts with the G-quadruplex-formed C9orf72
hexanucleotide repeat expansion, which causes the neurodegenerative
disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.25 On the other hand, only the RGG domains of CIRBP, TLS/FUS, and EWS
have been shown to bind the G-quadruplex.8−10 In particular,
the formation of the ternary complex between TLS/FUS and the G-quadruplex
of telomeric DNA and telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) leads
to telomere shortening and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine
9 and histone H4 at lysine 20 at the heterochromatin of telomeres.9

The conformational changes of G-quadruplex
structures regulated
by G-quadruplex-binding proteins are important for gene expression
and replication. DNA and RNA helicases unwind G-quadruplex structures
and enhance transcription, translation, or replication.1,2,26,27 NM23-H2, which unfolds G-quadruplex DNA in the promoter regions,
is necessary for its transcriptionally active form.28 The RRM and RGG domains in the C-terminal region of nucleolin
are necessary for inducing G-quadruplex formation of the c-myc promoter sequence.6 The RGG domain of
nucleolin is especially important for inducing a stable G-quadruplex.
Moreover, the RGG domain of the C-terminal domain in TLS/FUS and EWS
is important for folding G-quadruplex telomere DNA.9,10 On
the other hand, the RRM of hnRNP A1 unfolds G-quadruplex telomere
DNA, and the RGG domain of hnRNP A1 enhances the G-quadruplex unfolding
activity of RRM.5 Therefore, G-quadruplex-binding
proteins containing the RRM and RGG domains that are involved in folding
or unfolding G-quadruplex structures have been identified and their
functions investigated. The reasons for the differences in the effects
of these domains on G-quadruplex formation, however, are unknown.
Here, we investigated the effect of the RRM and RGG domains in nucleolin
on G-quadruplex formation. Our findings indicate that the Phe of the
RGG domain in nucleolin is responsible for G-quadruplex binding and
folding. Moreover, the RRM of nucleolin folds G-quadruplex structures
with guanine residues in the G-quadruplex terminal single strands
and loops. Our findings suggest potential mechanisms underlying the
effects of the RRM and RGG domains of nucleolin for G-quadruplex folding
and unfolding.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid Constructs
The nucleolin plasmid was used as
a template for polymerase chain reaction. The RRM-RGG (267–709)
and RRM (267–645) cDNAs of nucleolin were cloned into the pGEX6P-1
vector (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites
using the following sets of primers to express an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein: for RRM-RGG,
forward 1 d(CGG AAT TCT TCA ATC TCT TTG TTG GAA ACC) and reverse 1
d(CGC TCG AGC TAT TCA AAC TTC GTC TTC); for RRM, forward 1 and reverse
2 d(CGC TCG AGT TAT CTT TGA GAA TCT TCT CTG GAG AC). RRM-RGGF/A1,
RRM-RGGF/A2, RRM-RGGF/A3, and RRM-RGGF/A4 were obtained by replacing
Phe with Ala in RRM-RGG using a KOD-Plus- Mutagenesis Kit (Toyobo,
Japan) with the RRM-RGG in the pGEX6P-1 vector used as the template
and the following primers: for RRM-RGGF/A1, F/A forward 1 d(CGG CGC
TGG AGG ACG AGG TGG TGG T) and F/A reverse 1 d(CCT CTG CCT CCA CCA
CGA CCC CCG A); for RRM-RGGF/A2, F/A forward 1, F/A reverse 1, F/A
forward 2 d(AGG AGC TGG TGG CAG AGG CCG GGG A), and F/A reverse 2
d(CCT CGG CCT CCT CTA CCA CCA CCT CGT C); for RRM-RGGF/A3, F/A forward
1, F/A reverse 1, F/A forward 2, F/A reverse 2, and F/A forward 3
d(AGG CGC TGG AGG GCG AGG AGG CGC C) and F/A reverse 3 d(CCC CGG CCT
CTG CCA CCA AAT CCT CCT C); for RRM-RGGF/A4, F/A forward 1, F/A reverse
1, F/A forward 2, F/A reverse 2, and F/A forward 3, F/A reverse 3
F/A, forward 4 d(AGG CGC CCG AGG AGG CAG AGG AGG A), and F/A reverse
4 d(CCT CGC CCT CCA AAG CCT CCC CGG C). All constructs were verified
by automated DNA sequencing. All DNA oligomers were obtained from
Operon Biotechnologies (Japan).

Expression and Purification
of Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion
Proteins
All recombinant proteins were fused at the N-terminus
to GST and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS-competent
cells were transformed with the vectors, and transformants were grown
at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL).
Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside.
The cells were then grown for an additional 16 h at 25 °C and
harvested by centrifugation (6400g for 20 min). The E. coli pellets were resuspended in the following
buffers: WK buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate [pH 7.0], 150 mM KCl,
1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
and 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) or WLi buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
[pH 7.5], LiCl 20 mM, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride). The supernatants containing the expressed proteins were
lysed by sonication (model UR-20P, Tomy Seiko, Japan) and centrifuged
at 16 200g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
and glutathione agarose (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) were incubated
with gentle mixing for 1 h at 4 °C; the resin was washed with
WKT buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate [pH 7.0], 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT,
1 mM EDTA acid, and 1 v/v % Triton X-100) or WLiT buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
[pH 7.5], 20 mM LiCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 v/v % Triton X-100)
at 4 °C. GST-tags were cleaved using buffer containing 8 units/mL
PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) on a resin for 16 h at 4 °C,
and the protein was eluted with K buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate
[pH 7.0]) or Li buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 20 mM LiCl). The
protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Scientific, Altham, MA). All proteins were stored at 4 °C
and used within 12 h of purification.

Electrophoretic Mobility
Shift Assay
32P-Labeled
oligonucleotide annealing and G-quadruplex formation were induced
by heating samples to 95 °C on a thermal heating block and cooling
to 4 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min in K buffer or Li buffer.
Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μL
using 1 nM labeled oligonucleotide with various concentrations of
each purified protein with 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin in K buffer
or Li buffer. After incubating the samples for 30 min at 4 °C,
they were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide
= 19:1) nondenaturing gel. Both the gel and the electrophoresis buffer
contained 0.5x TBE buffer (45 mM Tris base, 45 mM boric acid, and
0.5 mM EDTA) with or without 20 mM KCl. Electrophoresis was performed
at 10 V/cm for 100 min at 4 °C. The gels were exposed in a phosphorimager
cassette and imaged by a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). To determine the equilibrium dissociation constants
(Kd), the data from four replicate experiments
were plotted as ϕ (1 fraction of free DNA) versus the protein
concentration, which is equal to the protein at which half of the
free DNA is bound. The Kd was extracted
by nonlinear regression using Microsoft Excel 2011 and the following
equation: ϕ = [P]/{Kd + [P]}.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
Circular dichroism
(CD) spectra were recorded on a model J-820 instrument (Jasco). The
CD spectra of DNA (2.5 μM strand concentration) with each protein
(2.5 μM) in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) were recorded
using a 0.2 cm pathlength cell at 20 °C. For each spectrum, the
spectrum of the corresponding buffer was subtracted, and these data
were not further processed (e.g., by smoothing).

Results and Discussion
RRM–RGG
Domain in Nucleolin Slightly Folded the BCL-2 G-Quadruplex
Structure and RRM Did Not Fold It
Nucleolin has four RRM–RGG
domains as a nucleic-acid-binding
region and binds to G-quadruplex DNA (Figure 1A).6,7 To investigate the G-quadruplex-binding
abilities of the RRM and RGG domains in nucleolin, we compared the
binding of the RRM–RGG domain and RRM alone to the modified
promoter sequence of the bcl-2 gene (BCL-2) (Figure 1B–D).
As BCL-2 forms an intramolecular hybrid (3 + 1) G-quadruplex
and nucleolin activates bcl-2 expression in living
cells, we used BCL-2 as G-quadruplex DNA in Figures 1 and 2 to investigate G-quadruplex binding and folding.6,21,29 All purified proteins discussed
in this article were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (Figure S1). The electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) data of the RRM–RGG domain or RRM
with various concentrations of BCL-2 were fitted
to a hyperbolic equation to give a Kd of
79.6 ± 4.0 and 73.6 ± 7.1 nM, respectively (Figure 1B,C). EMSA of the RGG domain
alone with BCL-2 did not show obvious binding (Kd > 2000 nM, Figure 1D). These results suggest that the binding
activity of nucleolin to BCL-2 depends mainly on
the RRM.

and its truncated mutants. (B–D) The equilibrium binding curve
was obtained by calculating the fraction of BCL-2
at varying RRM–RGG domain (B), RRM (C), or RGG domain (D) concentrations.
The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined
by fitting the data to the appropriate equation. The DNA–protein
complexes were resolved by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
visualized by autoradiography. (E) Circular dichroism spectra of BCL-2 with RRM or the RRM–RGG domain. Line colors:

of DNA and protein were both 2.5 μM. The G-quadruplex structure
is indicated in (B). Black circles in the cartoon of the G-quadruplex
represent a guanine residue.

To investigate the effect of nucleolin on the G-quadruplex structure,
we performed CD spectroscopy studies of BCL-2 with
1 equivalent of the RRM–RGG domain or RRM in nucleolin (Figure 1E). The CD of BCL-2 with the RRM–RGG domain or RRM showed a positive
peak at 262 nm, consistent with the result of a previous CD spectroscopy
study of BCL-2,8 which
was slightly increased in the presence of the RRM–RGG domain
and slightly decreased in the presence of the RRM. These findings
indicate that while the RGG domain has an important role in the induction
of the BCL-2 G-quadruplex structure, the RGG domain
does not show strong binding to the G-quadruplex structure and RRM
did not induce G-quadruplex formation of BCL-2. These
data are not consistent with previously reported findings that both
the RRM–RGG domain and RRM in nucleolin induce the G-quadruplex
structure of the promoter sequence of the c-myc gene
(c-MYC).4 Taken together,
these findings suggest that the effects of the RRM in nucleolin for
G-quadruplex folding might differ depending on the G-quadruplex structure
and its DNA sequence.

Phe in the RGG Domain of Nucleolin Contributes
to G-Quadruplex
Binding and Folding
The RGG domain is a G-quadruplex-binding
domain in several proteins.5−11 NMR-based-binding assays revealed that each Phe and Tyr of the C-terminal
of the RGG domain in TLS/FUS plays a central role in binding to G-quadruplex
telomeric DNA and TERRA.30 The RGG domain
in nucleolin contains a Phe adjacent to four Arg-Gly-Gly sequences
(Figure 1A). To evaluate
the role of the adjacent Phe in the RGG domain for G-quadruplex binding,
RRM–RGG domains with the Phe substituted with an Ala were designed
and expressed. The substitutions of Phe with Ala at different positions
and the resulting mutated proteins (RGGF/A1, RRM-RGGF/A2, RRM-RGGF/A3,
and RRM-RGGF/A4) are shown in Figure 2A. The EMSA of RRM-RGGF/A1, RRM-RGGF/A2, RRM-RGGF/A3,
and RRM-RGGF/A4 with various concentrations of BCL-2 fitted to a hyperbolic equation gave Kds of 75.5 ± 9.5, 71.8 ± 6.9, 171.8 ± 9.1, and >500
nM, respectively (Figure S2A–D).
These data indicate that the G-quadruplex-binding affinities of RRM-RGGF/A1
and RRM-RGGF/A2 were essentially the same as that of RRM–RGG,
but the binding affinities of RRM-RGGF/A3 and RRM-RGGF/A4, in which
three or four of the Phe were replaced with Ala, were decreased. Thus,
the increase of the number of Phe-to-Ala substitutions in the RGG
domain decreased G-quadruplex-binding affinities except for the Phe
to Ala point mutation of residue 690.

To estimate the role of
Phe in the RGG domain for G-quadruplex folding, we performed CD spectroscopy
studies of BCL-2 to examine the effect of substituting
Phe with Ala within the RGG domain of the RRM–RGG domain (Figure 2A,B). The CD spectrum
of BCL-2 with RRM-RGGF/A1 shows a decreased positive
peak at 262 nm compared with the RRM–RGG domain. As the number
of Phe-to-Ala substitutions in the RGG domain increased, the positive
peak at 262 nm of BCL-2 decreased, except for the
Phe to Ala point mutation of residue 690. These findings indicate
that replacing Phe with Ala at amino acids 663, 676, and 684 affected
G-quadruplex folding but the Phe to Ala substitution at amino acid
690 did not. Comparing the CD spectrum of BCL-2 with
RRM and RRM-RGGF/A3, RRM-RGGF/A4 strongly decreased the positive peak
at 262 nm (Figures 1E and 2). This finding suggests that the RGG
domain in which Phe was substituted with Ala enhances the G-quadruplex
unfolding activity of RRM.

RRM-Mediated Unfolding Does Not Depend on
the Differences between
Parallel and Hybrid G-Quadruplexes
The negative effect of
RRM in nucleolin for G-quadruplex folding of BCL-2
is not consistent with a previous report that the RRM in nucleolin
induces the G-quadruplex structure of the promoter sequence of c-MYC.4 These findings suggest
that the effects of RRM in nucleolin on G-quadruplex folding might
differ depending on the G-quadruplex structure or its DNA sequence.
Previous NMR analyses revealed that BCL-2 forms a
(3 + 1) hybrid type G-quadruplex and c-MYC forms
a parallel-type G-quadruplex.29,31 To investigate the
effects of the RRM in nucleolin for folding different G-quadruplex
structures, we performed CD spectroscopy studies of parallel-type
G-quadruplexes based on BCL-2 with RRM (Figure 3A). The number of
bases in the loops within each G-quadruplex is an important factor
in determining the topology of G-quadruplex structures.11,32 The (3 + 1) hybrid G-quadruplex of BCL-2 contains
one, three, and seven bases in each loop (Figure 1D). CD spectroscopy of mutated BCL-2, in which three bases in the loop were changed to one base (parallel BCL-2), showed a shift in the spectrum with a decrease in
the strong positive band at 265 nm (Figure 3A). This finding is characteristic of the
parallel form and consistent with the results of a previous CD study.8 These results suggest that the G-quadruplex DNA-folding
activities of RRM in nucleolin do not depend on the G-quadruplex topology.

of DNA and protein were both 2.5 μM. The G-quadruplex structure
is indicated. Black circles in the cartoons of each G-quadruplex represent
a guanine residue.

RRM Folded G-Quadruplex
with 5′-Terminal and 3′-Terminal
Single Strands Containing Guanine
We then investigated the
effects of different DNA sequences, not topology, for RRM-mediated
folding or unfolding of G-quadruplex structures. A comparison of the
DNA sequences of each previous NMR structure of BCL-2 and c-MYC revealed that c-MYC has single strands containing three bases at both the 5′-
and 3′-terminals of the G-quadruplex whereas BCL-2 does not (Table 1).29,31 To investigate the effects of the 5′-
and 3′-terminal single strands of G-quadruplex on RRM-mediated
folding, we performed CD spectroscopy studies of mutated G-quadruplexes
based on c-MYC in the presence of RRM (Figure 3B–E). The CD spectrum
of mutated c-MYC without 5′- and 3′-terminal
single strands (c-MYC Δterm) with RRM showed
a decrease in the positive peak at 265 nm, even though the c-MYC with RRM showed a slight increase in the positive
peak (Figure 3B,C).
These results suggest that RRM binds to 5′- and 3′-terminal
single strands and folds the G-quadruplex structure.

To characterize the DNA-binding
base of RRM in nucleolin, we analyzed
the binding ability of RRM to homo-oligo-DNAs such as dA10, dT10, dG10, and dC10 by EMSA (Figure S3). All homo-oligo-DNAs were folded in
buffer containing Li+ instead of K+ to inhibit
the formation of the G-quadruplex of dG10. The EMSA showed
that RRM binds well to dG10. The DNA sequence of each 5′-
and 3′-terminal single strand in c-MYC contains
one guanine among the three bases. We hypothesize that guanine in
the 5′- and 3′-terminals of G-quadruplex needs the RRM
to fold the G-quadruplex. To investigate the effect of the guanine
in the 5′- and 3′-terminals of the G-quadruplex for
RRM-mediated folding and unfolding of the G-quadruplex, we performed
CD spectroscopy studies of c-MYC mutated 5′-
and 3′-terminals (c-MYC GG/TT) with RRM (Figure 3D). c-MYC GG/TT comprises c-MYC with thymine substituted
for a guanine in the 5′- and 3′-terminals. The CD spectrum
of c-MYC GG/TT with RRM showed a decrease in the
positive peak at 265 nm. The CD spectrum of c-MYC with thymine substituted for a guanine in the loop (c-MYC G/T) with RRM was not changed compared to that of the c-MYC without RRM (Figure 3E). These results suggest that RRM mainly binds to guanine in the
5′- and 3′- terminal single strands and folds the G-quadruplex
structure.

Conclusions
This article reports
the amino acids in the RGG domain that are
important for G-quadruplex folding and the role of RRM in nucleolin
for G-quadruplex folding. Our findings suggest that the RRM domain
of nucleolin preferentially binds to the 5′ -and 3′-terminal
single strands containing guanine in the G-quadruplex and Phe in the
RGG domain contribute to the G-quadruplex folding. The RRM of nucleolin
folds the G-quadruplex with guanine-containing single strands, but
the RRM unfolds G-quadruplexes without guanines in the single strands
of the 5′- and 3′-terminals. The RRMs of hnRNP A1 and
hnRNP D are reported to bind and unfold G-quadruplexes.5,33 The X-ray structure of two RRMs in hnRNP A1 with single-stranded
telomere DNA revealed direct interactions with d(TAGG) and d(TTAGG)
in RRM1 and RRM2, respectively.34 The recognition
of d(TAG) in d(TTAGGG) by the RRM of hnRNP D was determined by NMR.33 These data suggest that RRMs of hnRNP A1 and
hnRNP D bind to guanine forming a G-tetrad and induces unfolding of
the G-quadruplex. This article shows that the RRM in nucleolin bound
preferentially to guanine and unfolded the G-quadruplex when it did
not contain single-stranded DNA (BCL-2) or if the
single-stranded DNA contained thymine in place of guanine (c-MYC GG/TT). The RRM of nucleolin might unfold G-quadruplexes
with a mechanism similar to that of the RRMs in hnRNP A1 and hnRNP
D.

Figure S2 shows that the Phe of
the
RGG domain in nucleolin is important for G-quadruplex binding, even
if the RGG domain alone does not show obvious binding to the G-quadruplex.
Mutated RGG domains in which some Phe were substituted with Ala (RRM-RGGF/A3
and RRM-RGGF/A4) decreased the ability of RRM to bind to the G-quadruplex.
The RGG domains in the C-terminals of EWS and TLS/FUS bind G-quadruplexes
and the substitutions of Tyr or Phe by Ala in the RGG domains decrease
G-quadruplex binding.10,35 These findings suggest that the
aromatic amino acids in the RGG domain of TLS/FUS and EWS are important
for G-quadruplex binding. The RGG domains of TLS/FUS and EWS are thought
to bind loops in G-quadruplexes. Furthermore, NMR studies of the RGG
domain in TLS/FUS with G-quadruplex telomere DNA indicate that Phe
in this domain interacts with the G-tetrad.30 The RGG domain in CIRBP binds to the G-quartet plane of a G-quadruplex
and the loss of Phe in this domain results in decreased binding.8 The Phe in the RGG domain of nucleolin might
bind to G-tetrad or loops with a similar mechanism as in TLS/FUS and
CIRBP.

The RGG domain is known as both a G-quadruplex folding
and unfolding
domain.5,6,9−11,36 The RGG domains in the C-terminals
of EWS and TLS/FUS fold G-quadruplexes, whereas the RGG domain in
hnRNP A1 promotes RRM-mediated unfolding of G-quadruplexes.5Figure 2 shows that Phe in the RGG domain of nucleolin contributes
to G-quadruplex stabilization except for the Phe of residue 690. The
RGG domain in hnRNP A1 contains Phe but it might not be able to achieve
G-quadruplex folding. The findings of the present study will contribute
to reveal the roles of the RRM and RGG domains conserved in many nucleic-acid-binding
proteins and to elucidate their biologic functions.
