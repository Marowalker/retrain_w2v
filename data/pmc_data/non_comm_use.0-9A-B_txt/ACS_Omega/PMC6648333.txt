A superior electrical conductivity
of 38.5 S/cm and an electromagnetic
shielding (EMS) effectiveness of −30 dB (−545 dB/mm)
across a wide frequency range of 0–15 GHz, including the X-band,
were achieved with thin organic paper of (55 μm) cellulose nanofiber
(CNF)/polyaniline (PANI) doped with (±)-10-camphorsulfonic acid
nanohybrid. Both electrical conductivity and EMS effectiveness of
the PANI-coated CNF were strongly affected by the amount and type
of dopant, which could be tunable after fabrication process via simple
in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline. Flexible and free-standing
film was obtained, since CNF provides good mechanical property without
diminishing the electrical property of PANI.

1 Introduction
Electromagnetic
shielding (EMS) material is becoming increasingly
important for achieving proper use of electronic devices and communication
systems.1−5 Electromagnetic waves produced by electronic devices using the radio
frequency band can damage human health6,7 or interfere
with the proper use of other devices; therefore, they are considered
a serious issue. Thus, effective EMS materials that can operate over
a wide range of frequencies are required.8 Furthermore, flexible and lightweight EMS materials are better suited
to be used in wearable devices.6,7,9−11 Metals, magnetic particles,12−15 and carbon materials16−20 have been widely applied as EMS materials, but these present difficulties
with processing and colorability. These problems can be overcome by
producing EMS materials made of completely organic components.21−25 Conductive polymers are organic materials that are particularly
promising for use in EMS applications.26−28 Aliphatic conductive
polymers such as polyacetylene have extremely high electrical conductivity
but are unstable under atmospheric conditions. However, aromatic conductive
polymers such as polyaniline (PANI) or polypyrrole (PPy), while atmospherically
stable, have lower electrical conductivity than that of polyacetylene.29 Therefore, these have been used in applications
such as batteries,30,31 EMS materials,32,33 actuators,34 sensors,35,36 and organic thermoelectric materials.37,38

PANI
is a typical conductive polymer that is easily synthesized
at low cost with good environmental stability.39 However, to achieve the required high electrical conductivity,
conductive polymers require a dopant such as hydrochloric, sulfuric,
or toluenesulfonic acid. A specific feature of PANI that distinguishes
it from other conductive polymers is the tunability of its electrical
conductivity. This is because some of its associated dopants are easily
detached and exchanged,28 allowing the
electrical conductivity to be adjusted by detaching the dopant species
to transform from the conductive emeraldine salt to the insulating
emeraldine base.40 Unfortunately, PANI
is rigid and brittle, so that PANI films are relatively fragile.41 To overcome this problem and achieve superior
mechanical properties and processability, PANI composites have been
blended with other polymeric materials.42

One such material, cellulose nanofiber (CNF), with a fiber
diameter
below 100 nm, is attracting much attention as a filler for polymer
composites due to its excellent mechanical properties.43,44 CNF, obtained from cellulose, is the most abundant natural resource
on earth; due to its good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and
hydrophilicity,45,46 it is currently used as a thickener
in food and paints. Recent studies have reported composites of CNF
and conductive polymers such as PANI and PPy.47−50 Nanocellulose-based conductive
polymer composites were produced by simply coating the CNF surface
or hybridizing within the polymer network.51

The most popular method of fabricating CNF conductive polymer
composites
is in situ oxidative polymerization, which initiates monomer polymerization
by adding an oxidizing agent to a solution containing well-dispersed
CNF. In this study, we fabricated CNF/PANI nanocomposites (Scheme 1) possessing superior
electrical properties via in situ oxidative polymerization. Previously,
several studies reported CNF/PANI nanocomposites and their application
to EMS materials. Marins et al.52 reported
an EMS effectiveness of −5 dB in the X-band with an 80 μm
thick film. Gopakumar et al.41 indicated
that the EMS effectiveness could be improved to −23 dB in the
X-band with a paper thickness of 1 mm. However, to be commercially
viable in electronic devices, a higher EMS effectiveness is required.
Therefore, EMS effectiveness as a function of paper thickness needs
to be further improved to match that of other carbon-based composites.16,18,19

Scheme 1 Preparation of CNF/PANI
Nanocomposites by Oxidative Polymerization
of Aniline
In this study, the
electrical conductivity and EMS efficiency of
the CNF/PANI nanocomposites were tuned by exchanging the dopant species
to achieve unprecedented efficiencies. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study that has used the CNF/PANI nanocomposite to
achieve an EMS effectiveness of −30 dB over a wide range of
frequencies, including the X-band. The tuned CNF/PANI nanocomposite
is a breakthrough that will pave the way to commercial application
in flexible and wearable electronic devices.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of PANI-Coated
CNFs
PANI-coated
CNFs were prepared via a stepwise process from pristine CNF to PANI–Cl-coated
CNF, dedoped-PANI-coated CNF, and finally PANI–CSA-coated CNF. Figure 1 shows color images
of pristine CNF and PANI-coated CNF papers with/without dopants. The
appearance of the PANI/CNF paper clearly changed after each the modification
step from blue to violet to green with Cl doping, dedoping, and (±)-10-camphorsulfonic
acid (CSA) doping, respectively. These color changes clearly reflect
exchanges of dopant species. The PANI/CNF papers retained the excellent
flexibility and foldability of the pristine CNF paper.

CNF, (b) PANI–Cl-coated

of flexibility of PANI–CSA-coated CNF.

During modification, a small amount of PANI coating on the
CNF
surface was peeled off as shown in Table 1. The PANI-dopant contents of the PANI-coated
CNFs were calculated using eq 1.48 1  Although the PANI–Cl-coated
CNF contained
62.0 wt % PANI–Cl, after detaching the Cl anion in ammonium
solution, the PANI-dopant content decreased to 45.0 wt %. Moreover,
after CSA doping, the PANI–CSA content decreased to 34.3 wt
%, suggesting the desorption of PANI–CSA due to a weak interaction
between PANI–CSA and the CNF surfaces.

2.2 Morphological Changes of CNF after PANI Coating
Figure 2 shows morphological
changes in CNF and the distribution of N obtained by scanning electron
microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM–EDS)
of PANI–Cl-coated CNF, PANI-coated CNF, and PANI–CSA-coated
CNF. Surface modification of CNF by PANI via in situ polymerization
was confirmed by EDS mapping, since N derived from aniline was predominantly
observed on the CNF surface. Small nanoscale particles of PANI were
observed on the CNF surface (Figure 2a). However, while exchanging the dopant species with
CSA, these disappeared (Figure 2c). The surface of the PANI–CSA-coated CNF was uniformly
smooth; however, N was observed on its surface (Figure 2c,f). This is due to mechanical detachment
of PANI during stirring for dedoping in the ammonium solution and
being partially soluble in m-cresol53 during the CSA-doping step, resulting in the formation
of a homogeneous layer by recoating and associated weight loss as
indicated in Table 1.

Figure 2 SEM–EDS (N) images of (a, d) PANI–Cl-coated CNF,
(b, e) PANI-coated CNF, and (c, f) PANI–CSA-coated CNF.

It is important to understand
the interaction between the conductive
polymers and the CNF surface in the composites.51 The affinity between these polymeric materials could be
increased via multiple hydrogen bondings between the −NH and–OH
groups of PANI and the CNF surface, respectively, to cause the recoated
PANI on the CNF surface to form a smooth and uniform layer.

2.3 Chemical Structures of PANI-Coated CNFs
PANI–CSA-coated
CNF paper was characterized by Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), as shown in Figure 3, and compared with pristine CNF and free PANI–CSA.
Pristine CNF showed a strong absorption peak at 3347 cm–1, assigned to νOH. Other peaks at 2899, 1656, 1438,
1370, 1028, and 899 cm–1 are attributed to νCH, δCH,in-plane, δOCH,in-plane, δCH,out-of-plane, νC–O–C, and vibration of anomeric carbon (C1), respectively.41,54 As regards PANI, peaks observed around 1550, 1470, 1290, and 802
cm–1 are attributed to νC=C,quinoid, νC=C,benzene ring, νCH,secondary amine, and δCH,benzene ring, respectively.55,56 The peak at 1140 cm–1 was attributed to the δCH vibration of the “electronic-like band” and
is considered to be a measure of the degree of electron delocalization.
Therefore, it is a characteristic peak of PANI conductivity.57,58

Dopant attachment was confirmed by a characteristic peak

2.4 Mechanical
Properties of PANI-Coated CNFs
The mechanical properties
of PANI-coated CNFs after tensile tests
(stress–strain curves are shown in Figure S2) are summarized in Table 2. Drastic deterioration of the mechanical properties
such as the tensile strength and the Young’s modulus was observed
when CNF was coated with rigid PANI. These results were consistent
with the previous reports,49,52 and reduced hydrogen-bond
formation between cellulose microfibrils due to surface modification
by PANI was considered to explain the deterioration in mechanical
properties.53 The PANI–CSA-coated
CNF showed better mechanical properties than the PANI–Cl-coated
CNF. This could be due to a decrease in the PANI content by elution
when changing the dopant using m-cresol. CNF was
considered to be a suitable support for improving the mechanical properties
of composites with conductive polymers, which are generally fragile
and rigid.

2.5 Electrical Conductivity of PANI-Coated CNFs
The electrical conductivity and resistivity of the PANI-coated
CNF papers are summarized in Table 3. The electrical conductivity of pristine CNF was relatively
low, 7.34 × 10–13 S/cm. However, the electrical
conductivity of the PANI–Cl-coated CNF rose steeply to 0.20
S/cm. Significantly, this value was considerably higher than those
previously reported for the CNF/PANI composites within the range 10–4 to 100 S/cm (Table S3 in the Supporting Information). Surprisingly, the electrical
conductivity of the PANI–CSA-coated CNF reached 38.5 S/cm,
which was 193 times higher than that of the PANI–Cl-coated
CNF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest electrical
conductivity ever reported for the CNF/PANI composites.

Table 3 Resistivity and Electrical Conductivity
of CNF, PANI–Cl-Coated CNF, and PANI–CSA-Coated CNF
sample	thickness
(μm)	surface resistivity (Ω/sq)	volume
resistivity (Ω cm)	electrical
conductivity (S/cm)	
CNF	35.1 ± 3.5	2.7 × 1013	1.40 × 1012	7.34 × 10–13	
PANI–Cl-coated CNF	87.5 ± 14.0	82.4 ± 1.4	5.23 ± 1.49	0.20 ± 0.0	
PANI–CSA-coated CNF	54.9 ± 15.8	5.3 ± 2.1	0.03 ± 0.00	38.5 ± 0.8	
One possible explanation is that because CSA is an excellent dopant
for PANI-coated CNF, it enhances the electron transfer to PANI. Moreover,
the dopant and solvent combination positively affected the electrical
conductivity. It is also known that the electrical conductivity of
PANI was drastically changed by the solvent choice. In this study,
a structural change from a compact coil to an expanded CSA coil is
considered to occur on treatment with a phenol-type solvent, m-cresol, as previously reported.59 Proton exchange between the imine group in PANI and the acid group
in the dopant is believed to be promoted by m-cresol,
with the efficient removal of protons from the dopant.

The effects
of the dopant content on the electrical conductivity
and the volume/surface resistivity of the PANI–CSA-coated CNF
are shown in Figure S3. The electrical
conductivity increased with increase in the CSA dopant content from
0.06 S/cm (0.1 mmol) to a maximum of 38.5 S/cm (0.5 mmol). However,
the electrical conductivity decreased when the CSA content was further
increased. These results indicated that achieving an optimum dopant
content is necessary to achieve high electrical conductivity, since
the dopant itself showed no conductivity.

2.6 Electromagnetic
Shielding
Theoretically,
an electrical conductivity above 10–1 to 1 S/cm
is necessary to achieve effective attenuation or shielding from microwaves.60 However, the high conductivity is complemented
by the formation of a continuous network and the presence of electric
dipoles in PANI/CNF, which further improve the overall shielding effectiveness.41

Typical spectra showing the EMS effectiveness
of the PANI/CNF nanocomposites are shown in Figure 4a. The effectiveness of the PANI–Cl-coated
CNF was only −3 dB, with a paper thickness of 88 μm.
Conversely, the PANI–CSA-coated CNF showed an improvement of
2 orders of magnitude in the EMS effectiveness of around −30
dB (97% attenuation) for the 0–15 GHz bandwidth including the
X-band (8.2–12.4 GHz), despite using a thinner paper of 55
μm. This excellent EMS shielding effectiveness is equivalent
to −545 dB/mm, considering the film thickness, as shown in Figure 4b.

Figure 4 EMS effects of (a) PANI–Cl-coated
CNF paper (thickness:
88 μm) and (b) PANI–CSA-coated CNF paper (thickness:
55 μm) with (right) or without (left) consideration of film
thickness.

The correlation between the dopant
content and the EMS effectiveness
of the PANI–CSA-coated CNF film is shown in Figure S4. The electrical conductivity and the EMS effectiveness
obtained with doped PANI-coated CNF at 10 GHz are shown in Figure S4(b). The maximum EMS effectiveness (−30
to −35 dB) was achieved at a dopant concentration of 0.5 mmol,
which also showed the highest electrical conductivity, while a lower
or higher dopant content did not give superior EMS effectiveness.
The EMS effectiveness is shown to be strongly affected by electrical
conductivity.61 Thus, both suitable dopant
and dopant content are essential for achieving both superior electrical
conductivity and EMS effectiveness.

Table 4 summarizes
the previously reported completely organic EMS materials. An EMS effectiveness
of −5 dB by PANI–Cl/CNF was reported by Marins et al.
(no. 1 in Table 4),
which was close to the value of −3 dB for no. 8 in Table 4, with the same components,
but the attenuation achieved was far from being viable for commercial
application to electronic devices.52 However,
the improvement in EMS effectiveness achieved by Gopakumar et al.41 to −23 dB in the X-band region for the
PANI–Cl-coated CNF with a paper thickness of 1 mm (no. 2) is
notable. However, this is not superior to carbon-based composites
in terms of thickness and EMS effectiveness, as shown in Table 4, when compared with
the results for nos. 3 and 4.16,18,19,41,46,52,62 In contrast
to no. 2, PANI–CSA-coated CNF (no. 9, thickness 55 μm)
was much thinner and showed superior EMS effectiveness reaching −30
dB (−545 dB/mm) over a wide frequency range of 0–15
GHz, including the X-band; this has, to the best of our knowledge,
the highest EMS effectiveness of all organic EMS materials previously
reported as shown in Table 4. The decrease in the thickness during the change of dopant
was due to a reduction in PANI by dissolution in m-cresol. It is noteworthy that the EMS effectiveness increased despite
a decrease in paper thickness for the PANI–CSA-coated CNF paper,
whereas the general rule is that EMS effectiveness increases with
paper thickness. The increase in EMS effectiveness is consistent with
the electrical conductivity spike of 38.5 S/cm, which is 193 times
that of the PANI–Cl-coated CNF. An attenuation above 97% could
be achieved by an EMS effectiveness exceeding −30 dB. A decrease
in the content of PANI, which is fragile and rigid, improved the flexibility
of the paper. Hybridization of a tough CNF with PANI–CSA, which
has good electrical conductivity, gave a free-standing paper with
superior EMS effectiveness over a wide band width including the X-band
region.

3 Conclusions
The
flexible and lightweight PANI/CNF nanocomposites, which were
successfully fabricated via in situ oxidative polymerization, appear
to show the highest EMS shielding efficiency ever reported. The electrical
conductivity and EMS shielding efficiency of PANI were improved by
replacing dopant species from HCl with CSA. The PANI–CSA-coated
CNF showed the highest electrical conductivity of 38.5 S/cm, which
was 193 times higher than that of the PANI–Cl-coated CNF. The
choice of dopant and its combination with a solvent having a phenolic
component such as m-cresol was significant in the
improving electrical conductivity. The PANI–CSA-coated CNF
nanocomposite with a paper thickness of only 55 μm achieved
an EMS shielding efficiency of −30 dB (−545 dB/mm) across
a wide frequency range of 0–15 GHz, including the X-band. The
PANI–CSA-coated CNF nanocomposite will be applicable not only
to EMS materials but also to capacitors or sensors due to its flexibility
and lightweight.

Polymer composites possessing excellent mechanical
and electrical
properties could be developed by compounding with the PANI–CSA-coated
CNF as a masterbatch.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Aniline, ammonium solution
(28%), ammonium persulfate (APS), m-cresol, CSA,
hydrochloric acid (HCl), and lithium chloride (LiCl) were purchased
from WAKO Chemical (Wako, Japan). CNFs in 1% water suspension, produced
by an aquatic counter-collision method from bamboo cellulose, were
provided by Chuetsu Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd. (Takaoka, Japan) and
were used as received.

4.2 Fabrication of PANI-Coated
CNF Nanocomposite
Paper
A diagram of the fabrication of PANI-coated CNF nanocomposite
paper is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting
Information). In situ oxidative polymerization of aniline on CNF was
conducted under atmospheric conditions. A 10 g sample of 1% CNF gel
(100 mg dry weight) was dissolved in 100 mL of 1 M HCl solution together
with aniline (1.4 mmol) and LiCl (0.2 mol), and the solution was stirred
for 1 h at −10 °C. An oxidizing agent, APS (1.75 mmol)
dissolved in water (50 mL), was slowly added over 1 h and stirred
for 3 h at −10 °C. The resulting PANI–Cl-coated
CNF gel was obtained after filtering with a membrane filter (pore
size 1.0 μm) and washing with water and acetone. The PANI–Cl-coated
CNF nanocomposite was obtained as a paper of 88 μm thickness
after freeze drying at room temperature (RT).

Chlorine ions,
as a dopant of the PANI–Cl-coated CNF gel, were detached by
soaking in an ammonium solution (1 M, 100 mL) and stirring for 3 h
at RT. Consequently, the PANI-coated CNF nanocomposite was obtained
after freeze-drying at RT.

Another dopant species, CSA (0.5
mmol), was dissolved in m-cresol (50 mL), added to
the PANI-coated CNF gel/ammonium
solution, and stirred for 3 h at RT to attach CSA as a dopant. The
PANI–CSA-coated CNF gel was obtained after centrifugation (5000
rpm, 10 min) followed by vacuum filtration and washing with acetone.
Finally, the PANI–CSA-coated CNF nanocomposite was obtained
as a paper of 55 μm thickness after freeze-drying at RT.

Free PANI–CSA was prepared in a similar manner from free
PANI and CSA without CNF.

4.3 Characterization
The morphologies
of the modified CNF and freeze-dried pristine CNF were observed using
field emission scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS) (JSM-7800F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at
an accelerating voltage of 15 kV with an electron conductive gold
layer.

The chemical structures of the CNF/PANI nanocomposites
were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy, using a Nicolet iZ10 attached
SMART iTR instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Tokyo, Japan), in
the wavenumber range 400–4000 cm–1 at a resolution
of 4 cm–1. Transmission spectra were measured using
a KBr disk blended with each sample.

4.4 Electrical
Properties
The electrical
conductivity was measured at 23 ± 2 °C by a four-point probe
method with a low-resistance meter (Loresta MCP-T410, Mitsubishi Chemical
Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan). The samples for measurement were prepared
in sizes of 4 × 16 mm2 from various PANI-coated CNF
papers, whose thicknesses were measured using a digital micrometer
(PG-01, Teclock Corporation, Nagano, Japan) with a resolution of 1
μm.

The EMS effectiveness of each sample was evaluated
at 23 ± 2 °C in the frequency range 0.45–15 GHz,
including G-, S-, and X-bands, with a network analyzer (MS202C, Anritsu
Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan) and a coaxial tube-type shield-effect
measurement system (SEM01 KEYCOM, Tokyo, Japan).
