We examine the applicability of urea
solutions as a novel cost-effective
chemical for enhanced oil recovery processes. Two sandpack flooding
experiments were conducted using 5 and 10 wt % urea solutions. Another
flooding experiment was also carried out using the same sandpack with
fresh water and used as a reference. Supporting experiments such as
interfacial tension (IFT), viscosity of water in oil (W/O) emulsions,
total acid number (TAN), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
were conducted to confirm the generation of in situ surfactants by
reacting urea solutions with the naphthenic acids in bitumen and evaluate
their impact on the oil recovery. The analyses of FTIR, IFT, TAN,
and viscosity measurements support the generation of in situ surfactants
that leads to the formation of stable water in oil emulsions and hence
a more stable displacement front resulting in higher oil recovery.

1 Introduction
Global reserves of bitumen
and extra heavy crude oils are three
times higher than the conventional crude oils with 10 trillion barrels
of bitumen around the world.1 Steam-assisted
gravity drainage (SAGD) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) are the
most common techniques that have been utilized to recover the bitumen.2 These recovery techniques are associated with
high energy consumption for
steam generation, excessive water treatment, and greenhouse gas emissions.
To overcome these challenges, co-injection of solvents with steam
has been suggested.3,4 Hydrocarbons such as pentane and
hexane are examples of the solvents that have been proposed to reduce
the required steam in the expanding solvent steam-assisted gravity
drainage (ES-SAGD) process.5 Recovery processes
such as CSS and SAGD mobilize viscous bitumen through viscosity reduction
by heating,6 while in solvent-aided methods,
both heat and dilution effects are utilized to mobilize the bitumen.
To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have examined factors
other than viscosity reduction to improve the recovery of bitumen
using ES-SAGD processes.7,8 Urea is a potential
candidate that can synergize the reduction in bitumen viscosity and
sweep efficiency improvement.9 Several
chemicals such as surfactants, alkaline, and ionic liquids have been
proposed in the literature to decrease the interfacial tension and
change the rock wettability toward more water-wet, thereby improving
the sweep efficiency of crude oil.10−18

Urea solution has a basic nature due to the presence of amino
functional
groups in the urea molecular structure enabling it to react with naphthenic
acids found in bitumen and generate in situ surfactants.19 Urea melts at 133 °C and starts to decompose
to ammonia and isocyanic acid (HCNO) at 152 °C, which is much
lower than usual SAGD temperature.20,21 However, at
the steam chamber condition of SAGD, above 200 °C, the urea solution
partially decomposes into ammonia and carbon dioxide.7 As a result of the decomposition at high temperature, urea
combines the advantages of ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia also
dissolves strongly in water condensing from steam to generate a basic
solution of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), which in turn reacts
with naphthenic acids found in bitumen to generate in situ surfactants.7,22 By virtue of in situ surfactants, water in oil (W/O) emulsion is
generated, and thus, the sweep efficiency of the process is improved
through the reduction of viscous fingering as a result of a more stable
displacement front. Water in oil (W/O) emulsions formed through an
alkaline environment are usually more viscous compared to fresh water
in the SAGD process, leading to the suppression of viscous fingers
formed through the flooding process.23 Moreover,
flooding the reservoir with alkaline solutions change the rock wettability
toward more water-wet due to the presence of polar compounds in alkaline
solutions, which are adsorbed to the rock surface containing different
charges.24 In addition to the generation
of in situ surfactants, ammonia effectively reduces the viscosity
and the total acid number (TAN) of acidic crude oil making it more
valuable and desired for refining.22,25,26 According to ASTM D664, the total acid number is
the milligram of potassium hydroxide (KOH) that should be added into
the solution to neutralize the acidic compounds found in 1 gram of
the crude oil.27 Carbon dioxide is another
important product resulting from the decomposition of the urea solution
at the SAGD steam chamber conditions. Carbon dioxide easily dissolves
in bitumen and improves oil mobility due to the viscosity reduction,
oil swelling, and lowering of the interfacial tension with formation
brine.8,28,29 Furthermore,
carbon dioxide is a non-condensable gas at the conditions of the steam
chamber that can reduce heat loss to the overburden formation leading
to recovery improvement.7,30

The objective
of this study is to investigate the capability of
urea solution to improve the sweep efficiency of bitumen via altering
the rock wettability toward water-wet and/or reduction of IFT. Sandpack
flooding experiments were conducted to investigate the efficiency
of urea solutions in the recovery of bitumen. The overall goal of
this work is to investigate the generation of in situ surfactants
through the reaction of naphthenic acids found in bitumen with urea
solutions and improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

2 Materials
Athabasca bitumen with a specific gravity
of 1.004 (°API =
9.44), viscosity of 29 cp at 150 °C and 500 psig, and molecular
weight of 513 g/mol was used as an oleic phase through the flooding
experiments. The molecular weight of bitumen was measured using the
freezing point depression technique. A simulated distillation test
(ASTM 7169) and the carbon number distribution of the Athabasca bitumen
have been reported in the literature.31,32 High-purity
urea provided by Amresco VWR Chemicals was dissolved in deionized
water to prepare urea solutions. A sandpack was prepared and packed
with fine glass beads of 120 mesh size to generate the porous medium
for the flooding experiments.

3 Experimental Work
3.1 Sandpack Flooding Setup
Flooding
experiments were conducted using a 1D sandpack flooding experimental
rig shown in Figure 1. The experimental rig consists of an axial vertical core holder
packed with glass beads to prepare the sandpack. A hydraulic hand
pump is used to apply a vertical pressure on the sandpack to imitate
the overburden pressure. A vacuum pump is utilized to vacuum the sandpack
and ensure that there is no air trapped in the sand during the flooding
tests. A back-pressure regulator designed and made by a machine shop
at the University of Calgary is installed to keep the pore pressure
at the desired value. A Quizix pump (QX6000) is used to inject water,
bitumen, and urea solutions through imbibition and drainage processes.
The accuracy of the injection rate of Quizix pumps is ±0.001
cm3, whereas the maximum flow rate and maximum pressure
that can be achieved are 50 cm3/min and 41 MPa (6000 psi),
respectively. To save the pump from corrosion, the urea solutions
are injected indirectly into the sandpack from an external stainless-steel
transfer cylinder. A pressure transducer from Sensotec Company with
a range from 0 to 100 psi (∼0.7 MPa) is used to measure the
pressure drop along the sandpack during the bitumen recovery process.
Pressure drop data is recorded and logged using SOLO 9696 data acquisition.
All the core holder, back-pressure regulator, and bitumen accumulator
were placed inside a temperature-controlled oven from VWR Company
to control the temperature. A heat exchanger is used for heating the
urea solution before being injected into the sandpack to ensure that
the solution enters the sandpack at the desired temperature. All fluids
produced from the sandpack are collected in graduated flasks to obtain
the recovery data as a function of time.

3.2 Flooding Experiment Procedures
The
axial core holder was packed with glass beads using the hammering
technique to achieve porosity and permeability as close as those of
the reservoir condition. Then, the sandpack was confined vertically
with 1000 psig (∼7 MPa) overburden pressure and flooded with
carbon dioxide (CO2) for 30 min at 50 psig (∼0.345
MPa) inlet pressure while the outlet was open to the atmosphere to
displace air from the sandpack. After that, the sandpack was vacuumed
for 1 h to remove CO2 as much as possible prior to water
imbibition. The sandpack was then fully saturated with distilled water
and pressurized to 500 psig (3.45 MPa) using the Quizix pump. Porosity
and pore volume of the sandpack are reported based on the amount of
the water imbibed into the sandpack. Absolute permeability of the
sandpack was calculated using Darcy’s law after measuring the
pressure drop through the sandpack at different water flow rates ranging
from 1 to 16 cm3/min. The sandpack was brought to 150 °C
for 3 h to ensure a thermal equilibrium at the desired temperature
and then flooded with hot bitumen to establish the initial oil saturation
(Soi). The flooding with hot bitumen was
continued for more than one pore volume (PV) of the sandpack to ensure
that no further water is produced. The displaced water was cooled
and collected using graduated flasks to measure the irreducible water
saturation (Swirr) of the sandpack after
eliminating the dead volume of tubes. Finally, the urea solution was
injected from the top side of the sandpack at a flow rate of 1 cm3/min and 500 psig (3.45 MPa) pore pressure to recover bitumen
from the bottom side. In all flooding experiments, a pressure drop
of 3–7 kPa was observed. The flooding process was continued
until the effluent fluid was only water. The produced emulsion was
collected as discrete samples with volumes ranging from 50 to 100
cm3 based on the abundance of bitumen in the produced emulsion.
The produced bitumen volume was then used to calculate the residual
oil saturation left in the sandpack.

4 Results
and Discussion
4.1 Sandpack Flooding Experiments
Three
flooding experiments including water flooding, 5 wt % urea solution
flooding, and 10 wt % urea solution flooding were conducted. The properties
of the sandpacks used in these experiments (length, bulk volume, pore
volume, porosity, absolute permeability, and irreducible water saturation)
are reported in Table 1. In the first experiment, the water flooding was started at an initial
oil saturation (Soi) of 0.873. More than
5.2 pore volumes (PV), 1430 cm3, of fresh water was injected
continuously into the sandpack at a flow rate of 1 cm3/min
until an effluent water cut of 99% is reached. The results shown in Figure 2 demonstrate that
∼73% of the original oil in place (OOIP) was produced at the
end of the hot-water flooding process. In addition, the result shows
an early water breakthrough at 6% of the PV of water injection.

In the second experiment,
the sandpack with an initial oil saturation
of 0.911 was flooded with 4.37 PV (1174 cm3) of 5 wt %
urea solution until a water cut of 93% was achieved. The results reported
in Figure 3 show that
the breakthrough has occurred at 12.2% of the pore volume injection
as compared to 6% in the first experiment, which indicates a noticeable
delay in the breakthrough time. Around 72% of the original oil in
place (OOIP) was produced at the end of the flooding experiment.

In the third experiment, 3.93 PV (1044 cm3) of
10 wt
% urea solution was injected into the sandpack at an initial oil saturation
of 0.863. The results shown in Figure 4 demonstrate breakthrough time at 12.8% PV of injection,
which is comparable with the 5 wt % urea solution injection. About
76% of the original oil in place (OOIP) was produced at the end of
the displacement with a water cut of 91% for the 10 wt % urea solution
flooding process.

4.2 Comparison of the Flooding Experiments
Figure 5 presents
the oil recovery factor at one and two pore volumes of injection for
all the sandpack flooding experiments. The results show that both
5 and 10 wt % urea solutions outperform water flood at 1 PV of injection,
while 5 wt % urea solution is more efficient than water flood and
10% urea solution at 2 PV of injection. The results clearly indicate
that the recovery of bitumen has improved when the urea solution is
injected. One reason behind the additional oil recovery can be due
to the generation of in situ surfactants and subsequent emulsification.
The emulsification caused by the presence of surfactants leads to
the formation of a highly viscous zone leading to a more stable displacement
front (less severe viscous fingering) and thus improves the oil recovery.
In addition, in situ surfactants generated as a result of the interaction
of urea solutions with naphthenic acids found in bitumen at high temperature
facilitate the dispersion of water droplets inside the oil phase.
In the following section, we have measured the interfacial tension
(IFT) of the urea solutions with bitumen, viscosity of W/O emulsions,
the total acid number (TAN), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra to further support this observation.

all three flooding experiments at one (left)
and two (right) pore volumes injected.

4.3 Measurements of Interfacial Tension (IFT)
Two concentrations of urea solutions (10 and 15 wt %) were prepared
to measure the interfacial tension (IFT) with bitumen at 100 °C
and 500 psig (3.45 MPa) using a pendant drop tensiometer as shown
in Figure 6.37 The tensiometer has a high-pressure, high-temperature
isolated cell with a volume of 600 cm3. A Quizix pump was
utilized to inject a small droplet of bitumen from a standard needle
into the isolated cell, which was prefilled with urea solution. Two
thermocouple probes were used to monitor and control the temperature
inside and outside of the isolated cell using a temperature controller.
A cell containing water and pressurized by nitrogen was connected
into the system to keep the pressure of the system constant at 500
psig (3.45 MPa). The light, digital camera, and software from Rame-hart
Instrument Company were used to record video frames and process them
to obtain interfacial tension using the Young–Laplace equation.33 The densities of water and bitumen are nearly
equal at 150 °C, which makes the IFT measurements using the pendant
drop tensiometer very difficult if not impossible. For that reason,
IFT measurements for bitumen/water and bitumen/urea solutions using
the pendant drop tensiometer were not feasible. However, for the purpose
of this study, a qualitative trend of the IFT would allow interpretation
of our experimental observations of the bitumen recovery factor. To
increase the density difference between bitumen and urea solutions,
the IFT measurements have been conducted at high concentrations of
urea (10 and 15 wt %) at 100 °C. The IFT measurements were started
as soon as the oil drop was formed at the tip of the needle, and the
IFT data were recorded at the rate of 1 frame/s for 2000 s. To ensure
the reproducibility of the results, each experiment was repeated twice,
and the final value was reported as an average of the last 100 s experimental
data. The IFT of bitumen and water measured by the pendant drop method
at 90 °C has been reported to be 34 mN/m.34 The results shown in Figure 7 reveal that the interfacial tension of the urea solution
and bitumen decreases by increasing the urea concentration. This observation
supports the fact that urea promotes water and oil emulsification
due to the generation of in situ surfactants,34−36 leading to
additional recovery of bitumen.

high-pressure IFT apparatus.37

of urea solutions at 100 °C and 500 psig (3.45 MPa). The IFT

4.4 Measurements
of Viscosity of W/O Emulsions
Two W/O emulsions were prepared
by stirring 15 g of bitumen with
30 g of 5 and 10 wt % urea solutions for 2 days at 150 °C and
400 rpm. Then, the mixtures were left for two weeks to allow the separation
of the two stable phases including W/O emulsion on the top and O/W
emulsion at the bottom. Small samples of each W/O emulsion were charged
into the pressure cell of an MCR 302 Anton Paar rheometer to measure
the viscosity of emulsions at 150 °C and 500 psig (3.45 MPa).
The results shown in Figure 8 reveal that the W/O emulsion treated with 10 wt % urea solution
has a higher viscosity compared to 5 wt % urea solution in the typical
shear rate of 20–100 s–1. The high viscosity
of the W/O emulsion treated with 10 wt % urea solution is attributed
to the small droplet size of water inside oil through generation of
W/O emulsion.38 The measured higher viscosity
of the 10 wt % urea solution is consistent with the lower interfacial
measurements for the same solution. Certainly, viscosities of these
emulsions are higher than viscosity of oil in water (O/W) emulsions
produced through the water flooding, which are less than 1 cP at the
operating condition of our experiments. The high viscosity of W/O
emulsions generated through urea solution flooding leads to the suppression
of viscous fingering and delays the water breakthrough to 0.12 PV
compared to 0.06 for the case of water flooding.

and 500 psi (3.45 MPa). (Green-shaded circle) 5 wt % urea solution,

the typical shear rate.

4.5 Measurements
of Total Acid Number (TAN)
The total acid number of the untreated
bitumen was measured to
be 3.768 mg/g. To measure the total acid number of the urea-treated
bitumen, three samples of the bitumen produced from each experiment
(5 and 10 wt % urea solution flooding) were collected separately at
different times. The total acid number (TAN) of each sample was measured
three times using a Metrohm 848 Titrino Plus instrument, and the results
are reported in Table 2. First, 1.5 g of each sample was diluted in 10 cm3 of
toluene to break the W/O emulsion formed through the flooding process.
Then, the solution was washed four times with 40 cm3 of
deionized water and centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 rpm to remove acidic
water droplets and urea contaminations from the treated bitumen. The
arithmetic average of the TAN values as a function of the pore volume
injected (collection time) are reported in Table 2. The results shown in Figure 9 reveal a significant reduction in the total
acid number of the urea-treated bitumen. The TAN values for the produced
bitumen through the urea solution flooding decrease sharply for the
first two pore volumes of injection followed by gradual increases
over time. The results shown in Figure 9 confirm the reaction of urea solution by the naphthenic
acids as evidenced in TAN reduction and formation of stable water
in oil emulsion in sandpack flooding experiments. The sharp decrease
in the total acid number is due to the sufficient contact and the
reaction between the urea solution and the naphthenic acids in bitumen.
The small gradual increase in TAN may be attributed to the poor contact
between the injected urea solution and bitumen at the later stage
of the displacement process that prevents the reaction with the naphthenic
acids.

solutions at different collection times. (Green-shaded circle) 5 wt

4.6 Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The
FTIR spectroscopy provides information on the chemical structure
and composition of bitumen. Representative FTIR spectra of bitumen
samples obtained after the water flooding experiment and reactions
with 5 and 10 wt % urea solutions are presented in Figure 10. The FTIR spectra of all
samples indicate expected features as evident in the FTIR spectrum
of bitumen derived from Athabasca oil sands.39Figure 10 shows
intense absorptions at 2850–2950 and 1370–1465 cm–1 corresponding to C–H stretching (ν(C–H))
and bending (δ(C–H)) vibrations, respectively. The peaks
at 1601 and 3052 cm–1 represent the aromatic C=C
and C–H stretching vibrations, respectively, which indicates
the presence of aromatic rings in bitumen samples. Also, the absorptions
at 1650–1710 and 3175–3550 cm–1 correspond
to C=O and overlapping O–H/N–H stretching vibrations,
respectively; this verifies the presence of carboxyl or amide groups
in bitumen samples. As seen in Figure 10, the carbonyl peak in the water flooding
sample is around 1700 cm–1. Interestingly, after
the reaction of bitumen with 5 or 10 wt % urea solutions at 150 °C,
the carbonyl peak shifts to around 1670 cm–1 and
becomes more evident in the FTIR spectra of 5 and 10 wt % urea-treated
samples. This is an indication of the formation of amide functional
groups and consequently verifies the formation of amide surfactants
through the reaction of carboxylic acids found in bitumen with urea
in 5 and 10 wt % urea solutions.

bitumen samples obtained
after the water flooding experiment and reactions with 5 and 10 wt
% urea solutions.

5 Conclusions
Three sandpack flooding experiments were conducted to investigate
the efficiency of urea solutions as a novel solvent for solvent-aided
thermal recovery processes. Our results indicated that urea solutions
positively impact the oil recovery efficiency, highlighting the synergy
between the reduction in viscosity of bitumen and generation of in
situ surfactants through the flooding process. The results indicated
that emulsification at the displacement front leads to formation of
an emulsion that has significantly higher viscosity than the aqueous
urea solution, leading to a more stable displacement front through
the suppression of viscous fingering and consequently higher oil recovery.
Interfacial tension measurements revealed a noticeable reduction in
the interfacial tension of the bitumen/water in the presence of urea
in the aqueous phase solution. In addition, measurements verified
a significant reduction in total acid number (TAN) of the treated
bitumen. To reveal the source of the IFT and TAN reductions, FTIR
measurements were conducted. The analysis of the FTIR measurements
indicated that the reaction of carboxylic acids found in bitumen with
the aqueous urea solutions led to the formation of amide functional
groups and thus the formation of amide surfactants, which confirms
IFT and TAN reductions. Comparisons of the flooding experiments revealed
that there is an optimum concentration of urea solution that leads
to more efficient displacement of oil by urea solutions, which may
be due to the effect of urea solutions on the wettability of the sand.
Future studies should focus on the wettability alteration of sands
due to the generation of in situ surfactants resulted from the reaction
of urea solutions with naphthenic acids.
