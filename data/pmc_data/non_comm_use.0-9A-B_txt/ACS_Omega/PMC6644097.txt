Vertically formed and well-defined
SnO2 nanosheets are
easy to fabricate, involving only a single process that is performed
under moderate conditions. In this study, two different sizes of a
SnO2 nanosheet were concurrently formed on a Pt interdigitated
electrode chip, with interconnections between the two. As the SnO2 nanosheets were grown over time, the interconnections became
stronger. The ability of the fabricated SnO2 nanosheets
to sense H2 gas was evaluated in terms of the variation
in their resistance. The resistance of a SnO2 nanosheet
decreased with the introduction of H2 gas and returned
to its initial level after the H2 gas was replaced with
air. Also, the response–recovery behaviors were improved as
a result of the growth of the SnO2 nanosheets owing to
the presence of many reaction sites and strong interconnections, which
may provide multipassages for the electron transfer channel, leading
to the acceleration of the reaction between the H2 gas
and SnO2 nanosheets.

1 Introduction
Because of the characteristic
properties of nanomaterials, they
are widely used in advanced industrial science and technology. These
properties are not found in the bulk state and instead depend on the
materials’ morphologies and nanostructures. Therefore, attention
has been focused on methods of controlling the size and morphology
of nanomaterials. Among these methods, those using an aqueous solution
to synthesize nanomaterials, enabling the precise control of their
size and morphology, have been the subject of much discussion,1−6 since these processes offer many advantages such as low energy consumption,
room-temperature synthesis, and low production and equipment costs.7 Using these processes, nanomaterials with a range
of nanostructures and morphologies can be fabricated.

Recently,
a process was developed for synthesizing SnO2 with a nanosheet
structure under moderate conditions without any
additives.8 Although several reports addressing
the synthesis of SnO2 nanosheets have been published, the
presented processes all required a high synthesis temperature (over
100 °C), the use of additives, or a heat-treatment process.9−12 Also, the SnO2 nanosheets were generally obtained in
a powder form with an overlapping or flowertype morphology. On the
other hand, SnO2 nanosheets produced by a single process
can be directly synthesized on targets and exhibit a well-dispersed
structure. Thus, SnO2 nanosheets with a high surface-to-volume
ratio can be obtained easily. Such novel SnO2 nanosheets
are expected to exhibit a higher level of performance in many fields.

Especially, in the area of sensors, nanosheets have attracted attention
in that they offer a candidate ideal structure,7 because such well-defined nanosheets have a high surface-to-volume
ratio as well as specific exposed crystal facets. The tuning of these
properties can improve the gas-sensing properties of sensors.

In a previous study,13 a SnO2 nanosheet synthesized using a single process was adopted for a gas
sensor based on SnO2 nanoparticles and noble metals for
detecting 1-nonanal gas, which is a constituent of the breath of lung-cancer
patients. The sensor incorporating the SnO2 nanosheet proved
to be much more sensitive than that without the SnO2 nanosheet.

In this study, to further examine the application of SnO2 nanosheets to gas sensors, we prepared a gas sensor consisting only
of a SnO2 nanosheet. The target gas was H2,
which was selected given its importance to fuel cells, which are currently
the center of considerable research as part of efforts to satisfy
the global demand for energy.14 That is,
the relationship between the size of a SnO2 nanosheet and
the sensor sensitivity was investigated for H2 gas.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the synthesized
SnO2 nanosheets on the Pt interdigitated electrodes. Regardless
of the condition, the ultrathin SnO2 nanosheets formed
vertically on the Pt interdigitated electrode chip. These were not
agglomerated and not arranged in parallel, i.e., the SnO2 nanosheets were well dispersed on the Pt interdigitated electrode
and interconnected with one another in such a manner that the edge
of one nanosheet touched the surface of another. The SnO2 nanosheets were of two different plane sizes; one was small and
tightly formed, while the other was larger but sparsely formed. The
plane size of both SnO2 nanosheets increased with the synthesis
time. For S-0.5, tightly formed (ca. 20 nm) SnO2 nanosheets
and sparsely formed (ca. 100 nm) nanosheets were observed (Figure 1a). For S-2, the
plane sizes of the two SnO2 nanosheets increased to ca.
70 and ca. 500 nm (Figure 1b). Moreover, the interconnections between the small SnO2 nanosheets could be clearly observed. For S-6, tightly formed
(ca. 100 nm) SnO2 nanosheets and sparsely formed (ca. 1
μm) SnO2 nanosheets were observed (Figure 1c). Also, strong interconnections
between the SnO2 nanosheets were observed. These interconnections
may act as multipassages for the electron transfer channel,9 which can accelerate the reaction of the SnO2 nanosheets with the gas species.

Figure 1 FE-SEM images of the
(a) S-0.5, (b) S-2, and (c) S-6 SnO2 nanosheet gas sensors.

For S-6, the cross section was
investigated after cutting with
a roll glass cutter. The results are shown in Figure 2. The SnO2 nanosheets crystallize
directly on the Pt electrode without any clearances. These results
were identical to those reported previously.7 The SnO2 nanosheets were formed in a single layer, meaning
that the thickness of the SnO2 film was equal to the plane
size of the SnO2 nanosheets. Even though the SnO2 nanosheets formed without any clearances, from a gas molecular point
of view, the structure is porous enough to enable diffusion. That
is, gas species can diffuse deep into the material. This porous structure
provides many reaction sites and, as such, enhances the response to
H2 gas of the sensors.15

gas sensor.

Figure 3 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the S-0.5, S-2, and S-6. For all
samples, the pecks of the XRD patterns were indexed to a tetragonal
cassiterite structure of SnO2 (JCPDS No. 41-1445). The
crystallite sizes of the SnO2 nanosheet were calculated
using the angular positions of the (110), (101), and (211) peaks at
2θ = 26.8, 33.8, and 51.7°, respectively. After 6 h, the
crystallite sizes perpendicular to the (110), (101), and (211) planes
were calculated to be 4.2, 4.0, and 4.9 nm, respectively. The crystallite
size perpendicular to the (101) plane was much smaller than that of
the others, suggesting slow growth of the crystallite size perpendicular
to the (101) plane.16 This result means
that the main growth direction of the SnO2 nanosheet was
parallel to the (101) plane. Thus, the mainly exposed crystal face
of the SnO2 nanosheet is assigned to the (101) plane.

Figure 4 shows
the
variation in the resistance of SnO2 nanosheet gas sensors
for 500 ppm H2 gas. The SnO2 gas sensors exhibited
a degree of sensitivity that was typical of an n-type semiconductor
gas sensor. When the sensors were exposed to H2 gas, their
resistances decreased. When the H2 gas was replaced with
air, the resistance returned to its initial level. This variation
in the resistance was observed for all of the sensors. This suggests
that the SnO2 nanosheets were well formed on the Pt interdigitated
electrode chips without any clearance gaps, regardless of the conditions.
The response to H2 gas, response time, and recovery time
of the sensors are summarized in Table 1. The sensing properties of S-P are also tabulated.
The sensing properties of S-0.5, S-2, and S-6 were superior to those
of S-P. For S-0.5, S-2, and S-6, the response to H2 gas
increased with the synthesis time. The response and recovery times
also changed with the synthesis time, which decreased as the synthesis
time increased. The SnO2 nanosheet gas sensor synthesized
for 18 h exhibited considerably unfavorable sensing properties because
of the significantly low resistance under both air and H2 gas. Among the fabricated gas sensors, S-6 exhibited the highest
response to H2 gas as well as rapid response and recovery
properties.

The reaction
scheme of a possible mechanism on the SnO2 surface is presented
below14,17    When the SnO2 sensor is exposed
to air at the reaction temperature, oxygen is adsorbed onto the SnO2 surface such that electrons are trapped. This corresponds
to the initial state of a SnO2 gas sensor. After the H2 gas is introduced, the H2 molecules react with
adsorbed oxygen species (Oads–), thus
liberating H2O molecules and trapped electrons. The electrons
return to the conduction band of the SnO2. As a result,
the resistance of the SnO2 decreases. After the H2 gas is replaced with air, the surface is restored by oxygen adsorption,
such that the resistance returns to its initial level. As indicated
by the reaction mechanism, the variation in the resistance is dependent
on the amount of adsorbed oxygen species and the reaction with the
H2 molecules, i.e., to realize a large variation in the
resistance, the sensor should have many reaction sites and these should
be able to adsorb both oxygen and H2 molecules. Among the
fabricated sensors, S-6 has the largest SnO2 nanosheets
and therefore can absorb much larger amounts of oxygen than either
S-2 or S-0.5. Hence, the best sensor response to H2 gas
was obtained with S-6. Moreover, the response and recovery properties
of the sensors were enhanced by increasing the synthesis time. Since
the recovery of SnO2 gas sensors is relatively inferior,18 the enhancement of the response and recovery
times is particularly important. In the case of the fabricated sensors,
the SnO2 nanosheets were interconnected as can be seen
in the FE-SEM images (Figure 1). Also, the interconnections became stronger as the plane
size of the SnO2 nanosheets increased. These interconnections
may act as multipassages for the electron transfer channel,9 accelerating the reaction with the gas species
on the SnO2 nanosheets, leading to an enhancement in the
response and recovery properties.

Figure 5 shows the
response of S-6 for various H2 gas concentrations. The
response varies with the H2 gas concentration, with the
response to H2 gas being essentially the same for a particular
concentration of H2 gas, demonstrating that the sensor
exhibited a reversible response. The responses to H2 gas
concentrations of 5000, 500, 50, and 5 ppm were calculated to be ca.
31.8, 12.8, 3.2, and 1.6 as the H2 concentration increased,
and 26.2, 9.3, 2.9, and 1.3 as the concentration decreased, respectively.
According to a previous report,19 the sensor
response to H2 gas should be proportional to a square root
of hydrogen concentration. For this sensor, the response exhibited
linear increase with increasing square root of the partial pressure
of H2 gas, indicating the applicability of the prepared
sensor structure for the real field application.

H2 concentrations.

3 Conclusions
SnO2 nanosheet gas
sensors were successfully fabricated
using a single process. Two different plane sizes of SnO2 nanosheets were formed concurrently, growing vertically on a Pt
interdigitated electrode chip without any clearances. The plane sizes
of both SnO2 nanosheets increased with the synthesis time.
After being synthesized for 6 h, the SnO2 nanosheets had
grown to ca. 100 and ca. 1 μm. The SnO2 nanosheets
were well dispersed and interconnected.

The resistance of the
SnO2 nanosheets decreased with
the introduction of H2 gas but then returned to the initial
level after the H2 was replaced with air. The response
to H2 gas and response–recovery time changed with
the synthesis time. The properties improved as the synthesis time
increased. This is thought to be a result of the large SnO2 nanosheets having many reaction sites and strong interconnections,
which may act as multipassages for the electron transfer channel.
Therefore, the reaction with the H2 gas was accelerated
on the SnO2 nanosheets. Furthermore, the resistance of
a SnO2 nanosheet gas sensor was found to be dependent on
the gas concentration and exhibited a reversible response.

4 Methods
A SnO2 nanosheet was directly synthesized
on a Pt interdigitated
electrode chip (G-IDEPT5, Drop Sens) using SnF2 (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd., 90.0% pure). The surface of the Pt interdigitated
electrode chip was cleaned by light irradiation using a vacuum ultraviolet
light (PL16-10 low-pressure mercury lamp, air flow, 100 V, 200 W,
SEN Lights Co.) for 0.3 h to ensure the effective nucleation and growth
of the SnO2 nanosheet on the surface.20 Then, the cleaned Pt interdigitated electrode chip was
placed in a polypropylene vessel. Next, SnF2 (0.8706 g)
was dissolved in distilled water at 90 °C (200 cm3) in a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) bottle, and the resulting solution
was added to the vessel. Subsequently, the vessel was held at 90 °C
in a drying oven (DKN402, Yamato Scientific Co., Ltd.) for 0.5, 2,
and 6 h to fabricate the SnO2 nanosheet sensors. The fabricated
sensors were rinsed under running water and then dried using an air
blower. The precipitates synthesized via the same process for 0.5,
2, and 6 h were collected for crystal growth analysis. To facilitate
appropriate comparisons, SnO2 nanopowder (Sigma-Aldrich,
≤100 nm size) was dissolved in ethanol and the solution was
deposited on the cleaned chip. Herein, the SnO2 nanosheet
sensors synthesized for 0.5, 2, and 6 h are denoted S-0.5, S-2, and
S-6, respectively, and the SnO2 nanopowder sensor is denoted
S-P.

The surface morphologies and cross sections of the SnO2 nanosheet sensors were observed using a field emission scanning
electron microscope (FE-SEM; JSM-6335FM, JEOL Ltd.). X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD; SmartLab, Rigaku) patterns of the precipitates were
obtained using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA) in the 2θ
ranges of 10–70°. The crystallite size was calculated
using the Scherrer equation.21 The gas-sensing
performances were assessed using a digital multimeter/switch system
(Model 2700, Keithley Instruments Inc.). The fabricated sensors were
placed in a quartz chamber, which was set in the center of a furnace,
after which the temperature was increased to the operating temperature,
that is, 300 °C. To stabilize the sensors, pretreatment was carried
out at the operating temperature for 3 h under a flow of compressed
air. Each concentration of the H2 target gas was prepared
by mixing pure gas (GL Science Inc.) with compressed air. The total
gas flow rate into the chamber was maintained at 100 cm3 min–1. The electrical resistance between the electrodes
was measured under compressed air and the target gas. The sensor signal
sensitivity, 90% response time, and 90% recovery time, which are the
times required to reach 90% of the total change in the resistance,
were investigated. The sensor signal response to H2 gas
(R) relative to the target gas was defined as Ra/Rg, where Ra and Rg are the
electrical resistances under air and the target gas, respectively.
