In vitro mutagenesis methods have
revolutionized biological research
and the biotechnology industry. In this study, we describe a mutagenesis
method based on synthesizing a gene using a complete set of forward
and reverse spiked oligonucleotides that have been modified to introduce
a low ratio of mutant nucleotides at each position. This novel mutagenesis
scheme named “Spiked Genes” yields a library of clones
with an enhanced mutation distribution due to its unbiased nucleotide
incorporation. Using the far-red fluorescent protein emKate as a model,
we demonstrated that Spiked Genes yields richer libraries than those
obtained via enzymatic methods. We obtained a library without bias
toward any nucleotide or base pair and with even mutations, transitions,
and transversion frequencies. Compared with enzymatic methods, the
proposed synthetic approach for the creation of gene libraries represents
an improved strategy for screening protein variants and does not require
a starting template.

Introduction
The ability to produce
a large number of protein variants that
are screened to optimize the desired protein function continues to
expand our technological progress. Directed molecular evolution relying
on random and semirandom mutagenesis of genes has become a powerful
strategy for modifying protein properties.1,2 There
are already many proteins whose function has been modified by selecting
variants from a created protein library. For example, variant proteins
with stability to high temperatures,3 extreme
pH,4,5 and organic solvents6,7 have been obtained.
Moreover, variant enzymes with improved activities8,9 or
specificity changes10,11 are available. Other physical
properties, such as oligomerization of a target protein12,13 or color of fluorescent proteins have also been modified.14,15

Although screening and selection are intrinsically related
to the
particular properties of the target protein, the generation of genetic
diversity at the gene level is a more general issue and depends on
the mutagenesis method employed.1,2,16 Soon after the advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique,
it was determined that random point mutations were generated during
the in vitro amplification process,17,18 and protocols
were developed to take advantage of such mutations, creating the error-prone
PCR (epPCR) mutagenesis approach.19,20 Now, it is
well known that manganese ions and unbalanced dNTP ratios,21,22 nucleotide analogs,23 and low-fidelity
DNA polymerases24,25 promote the random incorporation
of erroneous nucleotides.

On the other hand, early studies on
oligonucleotide synthesis performed
on a solid phase demonstrated that when added in equimolar concentrations,
the four DNA monomer phosphoramidites dA, dC, dG, and dT have similar
chemical reactivity.26 In 1986, taking
advantage of the equal nucleotide reactivity, the 30 bp glucocorticoid
response element of the mouse mammary tumor virus was randomized by
spiked oligonucleotides, wherein each position was doped during automated
DNA synthesis by the low levels of the other three phosphoramidites.27 This work confirmed the robustness of the method
to produce all of the expected mutations by sequencing 546 clones
and finding 88 different base substitutions out of the 90 possible
single mutants. A similar mutagenesis approach was reported the following
year by Hill et al.28 and 4 years later
by Dale et al.29 Using genes as templates,
researchers incorporated spiked oligonucleotides by PCR-based methods
to modify specific regions of the encoded proteins.30 More recently, Hidalgo et al.31 and Jin et al.32 reused the spiked oligonucleotides
to achieve a focused and directed evolution in certain regions of
the regulatory elements and enzymes via in vitro recombination with
oligonucleotides bearing the wild-type sequence.

In the recent
era of synthetic biology, using only the sequence
information without any gene template, libraries of synthetic genes
have been prepared by two similar approaches termed “Synthetic
Shuffling”33 and “Assembly
of Designed Oligonucleotides”.34 In both methods, the gene library is assembled by appropriately
prepared oligonucleotides containing saturated degeneracies at the
desired nucleotide positions, selected by sequence alignments of homologous
genes. The precise annealing required to form full-length genes is
achieved by controlled overlapping of the designed oligomers. However,
contrary to the spiked oligonucleotides, ordinary primers synthesized
with saturated degeneracies at some positions rapidly increase the
number of variants at the nucleotide level35 and enrich the libraries with protein variants harboring multiple
amino acid mutations, which usually affect either the folding or function
of most encoded proteins. The fundamental difference between spiked
and ordinary degenerated oligonucleotides relies on the level of doping
of the wild-type nucleotides. In spiked oligonucleotides each wild-type
nucleotide is “doped” during the chemical synthesis,
with a very low ratio of the other three bases, yielding oligonucleotide
mutants harboring very few changes per chain and a high ratio containing
the wild-type sequence. However, in ordinary commercial degenerated
oligonucleotides, the target nucleotides are completely replaced with
an equimolar ratio of the desired mixed bases: N: A/G/C/T, V: A/C/G,
D: A/G/T, H: A/T/C, B: C/G/T, M: A/C, R: A/G, W: A/T, S: C/G, Y: C/T,
or K: G/T, producing oligonucleotide mutants harboring multiple mutations
per chain and practically nothing of the wild-type sequence when more
than 12 nucleotides are randomized with N.

In this article,
for the first time, we report the strategy of
using a complete set of spiked oligonucleotides to introduce mutations
throughout an entire synthetic gene, an approach that according to
a review written by Wong et al. has not been reported yet.36 This method is not limited to a target region,
as previously described,30−32 or to a reduced number of target
nucleotides.33,34 This synthetic strategy, which
we have named “Spiked Genes”, was applied to the monomeric
enhanced red fluorescent protein emKate.37,38 This relatively small protein composed of 243 amino acids, including
a polyhistidine tag on its carboxy end, was selected as a model test
not only because its small gene is suitable for chemical assembly
but also because emKate harbors the mutation S158A with respect to
the original mKate protein,39 a mutation
that makes it more fluorescent than its parental protein.38 Moreover, some amino acid replacements on its
scaffold produce variants of a different color,37 similar to the protein DsRed that served as a scaffold
for producing a palette of fluorescent proteins termed mFruits.14

Results and Discussion
Gene Library Synthesis
The synthetic emKate gene library was assembled,
as described in the Methods section, by a
one-step strategy using a diluted equimolar
pool of 22 internal spiked oligonucleotides and two outermost spiked
oligonucleotides as extension primers (Figure 1).37 The optimal
concentration of the internal oligonucleotides was 4 nM, 100-fold
less concentrated than that of the external primers. The assembly
efficiency was sensitive at higher internal oligonucleotide concentrations
likely due to mispairing between some of them and the external primers.
We did not observe any assembly efficiency difference between the
wild-type37 and spiked mutant oligonucleotides.

arrow represents a spiked oligonucleotide, wherein each position was
doped with 0.25% of each of the other three bases. Primer sequences
are listed in Table S1. (A) Scheme of the

concentrations of the internal primers (4, 8, and 16 nM) and outermost
primers at 400 nM, analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the

To evaluate the higher efficiency of Spiked Genes
for generating
random point nucleotide substitutions, we compared our method with
the mutagenesis efficiencies, over the emKate gene, of three enzymatic
epPCR-based methods: two commercial mutagenesis kits (GeneMorph II
and Diversify) and the traditional epPCR method.20 The Diversify PCR Random Mutagenesis Kit is based on the
methods of Leung et al.19 and Cadwell and
Joyce20 and relies on the use of Titanium
Taq polymerase and different concentrations of manganese and dGTPs
to achieve different mutation rates. GeneMorph II is a commercial
mutagenesis kit containing Mutazyme II: a blend of two error-prone
DNA polymerases.25 One of these enzymes
is Mutazyme I, which favors mutations at G’s and C’s,
whereas the other is a novel Taq DNA polymerase mutant
that exhibits increased misinsertion and misextension frequencies
at A’s and T’s compared with those of the wild-type Taq.

Analysis of the Libraries
To evaluate
the mutagenic
efficiency of the Spiked Genes method versus the three error-prone
enzymatic methods, we used three parameters to define the quality
of DNA libraries:16,40 (1) the mutation distribution,
which evaluates the capacity of the method to spread point mutations
along the complete gene sequence, (2) the mutation rate, which evaluates
the prediction ability of the method to achieve an expected number
of point mutations per kb, and (3) the mutational diversity, also
known as the mutational spectrum, which evaluates the capacity of
the method to produce all type of transition and transversion mutations.41 To measure these parameters while avoiding misrepresented
data, we randomly selected several clones (independent of the phenotype
displayed) from the antibiotic supplemented plate. A total of 57 867
bases were sequenced for this analysis (Table 1).

Mutation Distribution
The first point to highlight
from the sequencing results was the homogeneous distribution of mutations
generated along the entire gene (Figure 2). Using our Spiked Genes method, we did
not observe accumulation or reduction of mutations at any location
of the gene, even at the boundaries of the oligonucleotides used.
Similar evenly distributed results were also obtained for the libraries
created by the three enzymatic mutagenesis methods tested. Although,
for the enzymatic methods, some bases were more prone to be replaced
than others due to the nucleotide specificity of the DNA polymerases,
which is dependent on the surrounding sequence.24

Figure 2 Experimental mutation distribution of the libraries constructed
with the four methods examined. Each bar represents a point nucleotide
substitution at a certain location of the gene from the initial ATG
codon. The bar height represents the number of substitutions found
in each position.

Mutation Rate
For our Spiked Genes method, the expected
mutation rate was 15 changes/kb due to the 0.75% doping ratio per
base per strand and therefore 1.5% per base-pair. The experimental
results exhibited an average replacement rate of 10.3 point mutations
per kb, which was slightly lower than the expected value, as shown
in Table 1. This difference
between the theoretical and experimental values reflects a selective
pressure during the PCR assembly process to favor pairing of complementary
primers with the least ratio of mismatches. The difference between
the theoretical and experimental mutation rates would probably decrease
using less stringent annealing conditions during the PCR step.

Because of the 1.0% experimental mutation rate, the mutagenesis of
the 0.7 kb emKate gene (with our method) resulted in an average of
seven nucleotide changes at the DNA level and four or five amino acid
changes at the protein level, which is appropriate for performing
experiments of directed evolution in most protein targets.40 However, if a lower mutagenic rate is desired
for elucidating protein function–structure relationships, the
doping ratio may be simply reduced during the oligonucleotide synthesis
to achieve one or two amino acid changes per protein variant.

Such fine control in the mutagenic rate of the Spiked Genes method
is hardly achievable by the enzymatic mutagenesis approaches. In our
experiment, using the epPCR protocols reported in the literature produced,
on an average, 5.8 replacements per kb (0.8 replacements less than
the expected 6.6 changes/kb). However, the range of mutagenic rates
with the epPCR methods is very broad.24 Using similar mutagenic conditions, with different target genes
and Taq DNA polymerases from different suppliers, we have observed
mutation frequencies as high as 25 changes per kb (results not shown).
None of the commercial epPCR mutagenesis kits tested could achieve
the predicted value even when the mutagenesis conditions were set
to reach the maximal mutation rate. Whereas the 4.2 mutations per
kb rate of the GeneMorph II kit was lower than the expected mutation
rate and the 7.2 mutations per kb rate of the Diversify kit surpassed
the expected value (Table 1).

Mutational Diversity
The mutational
spectrum is the
most important parameter to assess the quality of mutagenesis libraries.
The ideal mutagenesis method should be able to replace any base in
the gene with any of the other three bases at the same frequency.
Mutational diversity can be examined by different parameters.41,42 One is by analyzing the ratio of transitions (Ts) to transversions
(Tv). Transition mutations are purine (G and A) to purine changes
and pyrimidine (T and C) to pyrimidine changes, whereas transversions
are changes from purine to pyrimidine and from pyrimidine to purine.
In this regard, the theoretical transitions to transversions ratio
is 0.5 because there are 4 possible transitions (A → G, G →
A, C → T, and T → C) and eight possible transversions
(A → C, C → A, T → A, A → T, C →
G, G → C, T → G, and G → T). The analysis of
the libraries constructed for this work showed that our Spiked Genes
method, with a 0.61 Ts/Tv ratio, yielded the most diverse library.
However, the classical and diversify epPCR libraries produced less
diverse libraries, with Ts/Tv ratios of 1.81 and 3.16, respectively.
In other words, the epPCR libraries produced 64.4 and 76.0% of transitions,
although the expected value is 33.3%.

Another way to evaluate
the mutational diversity is by calculating the ratio of AT →
GC to GC → AT transition mutations (AT → GC/GC →
AT ratio), which would be 1 for a perfectly unbiased mutagenic method
targeting a gene with the same proportion of AT and GC pairs. As observed
with the Ts/Tv ratio, Spiked Genes yielded the most even library,
producing an experimental AT → GC/GC → AT ratio of 0.88
versus the expected 0.91 value calculated for the nucleotide composition
of the emKate gene (A 26.13%, T 21.45%, G 27.72%, C 24.66%) (Table 1). Instead, the classical
epPCR and diversify methods yielded GC-enriched libraries.

Finally,
mutational diversity can also be assessed by measuring
the ratio between the frequency of mutating A’s and T’s
versus the frequency of mutating G’s and C’s (AT →
NN/GC → NN ratio). This ratio should also be 1 for an unbiased
mutagenic method that targets a gene with equal concentrations of
ATs and GCs. For the Spiked Genes method, we measured the AT →
NN value as 46.90%, which was very close to the 47.58% expected value
for nucleotide composition of the emKate gene, whereas the GC →
NN experimental value was 53.10% as compared with the expected value
of 52.38%.21,22,43 For the enzymatic methods, GeneMorph II produced less biased results
than classical epPCR or the Diversify kit that generated a higher
AT → GC bias.

We dissected our results to analyze the
individual mutations found
in the coding strand, normalizing each type of mutation with respect
to the wild-type nucleotide content of the gene. Figure 3 shows that the Spiked Genes
method yielded the broadest mutagenesis spectrum among all methods,
whereas the enzymatic methods had a poor representation of the transversions
C → G, G → T, G → C, T → G, and C →
A, a result that is in concurrence with that reported by Alexander
et al.44 for GeneMorph II. At the protein
level, the nucleotide bias of enzymatic methods favors neutral amino
acid replacements due to the protecting nature found in the degeneracy
of the genetic code, leaving unexplored a large fraction of the sequence
space. Again, the analysis of individual mutations reflected a clear
advantage of the Spiked Genes method over that of the enzymatic-based
approaches to produce more complete libraries of protein variants,
as reported in the supplementary Table S2, wherein all of the amino acid replacements found in the four libraries
were analyzed. Clearly, Spiked Genes created amino acid substitutions
unachievable by the other methods.

Figure 3 Experimental/expected frequency ratios
for each of the 12 possible
nucleotide mutations. The pointed line indicates the ideal normalized
value for every substitution.

Although nonbiased mutagenic libraries are mainly used to
perform
directed evolution studies, controlled-bias mutagenic libraries are
occasionally preferred to favor certain amino acid mutations.36,45,46 Thus, it is important to have
an adjustable method for setting specific transition/transversion
bias to achieve the maximal coverage of desired amino acid substitutions.
For this matter, the Spiked Genes method can be finely tuned to produce
the desired mutation frequency and mutational bias by simply changing,
during oligonucleotide synthesis, the proportion of the spiked bases.
Moreover, if an important functional region is discovered after the
first screening of the library, our method allows the mutational enrichment
of this specific region by reusing some of the spiked oligonucleotides
used in the initial assembly, which may be selectively incorporated
by additional rounds of mutagenesis via overlapped PCR.47

Together, all of the presented results
confirm that the Spiked
Genes method is a superior mutagenesis approach to produce libraries
with evenly distributed random point nucleotide substitutions and
affords an accurate statistical description of the library composition,
contrary to the libraries built by epPCR approaches.40 Unfortunately, our method also showed a higher deletion
rate than the enzymatic methods. It is well known that due to the
inefficient coupling of the incoming nucleoside phosphoramidites and
subsequent inefficient capping of the growing oligonucleotide chains
that fail to be blocked synthetic oligonucleotides contain a high
rate of single nucleotide deletions.48−50 The deletion rate can
be reduced during synthesis by increasing the concentration of the
nucleoside phosphoramidites to improve coupling yield at every nucleotide
addition and using a double capping step to improve blocking.51,52 Deletion mutations can also be reduced by postsynthesis purification
of the oligonucleotides by size exclusion chromatography, high-performance
liquid chromatography, or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as it
has already been done to assemble complete virus genomes.53 These improvements will render higher quality
libraries.

Mutant Analysis
After transforming Escherichia
coli competent cells with only one-tenth of the ligation
reaction, nonbiased random mutagenesis of the emKate gene using the
Spiked Genes method produced 181 colored colonies out of 1995 colonies
selected on kanamycin. From the analyzed colonies, 149, 16, 4, and
12 were red, green, yellow, and orange variants, respectively. As
expected, one clone containing the wild-type emKate intact sequence
emerged after sequencing the plasmid from 12 red colonies, whereas
the rest of the red clones contained an average of 2 to 3 amino acid
replacements and only 2 clones contained 6 and 8 changes. Most of
the substitutions corresponded to neutral replacements.

The
color variation observed in some of the mutant clones (Figure 4A) was the result of incomplete
maturation of the DsRed-type chromophore present in the emKate protein.37 In some variants, the chromophore was trapped
as a GFP-like immature intermediate (Figure S1). As a consequence, some variants showed an orange phenotype that
corresponded to a mixture of two proteins: one that remained in the
GFP-like state, with an absorbance peak of approximately 470–500
nm and another that reached the DsRed-like state, with an absorbance
peak of approximately 580–600 nm. The simultaneous emission
of green and red lights produced the orange phenotype. Proteins displaying
slow and incomplete maturation of their chromophores have been extensively
used as fluorescent timers,54 and perhaps
some of our variants could also be used as timers.

Figure 4 emKate mutants generated
by the Spiked Genes method. (A) E. coli colonies expressing wild-type GFP, a nonfluorescent
GFP mutant containing the multiple mutations L64A/C65M/Y66G/G67V,
wild-type emKate, and the representative fluorescent mutants found
in the library. (B) Absorbance spectra of the mutants and reference
proteins shown in panel A.

The different levels of protonation of the chromophore also
influenced
the observed phenotypes, as revealed by the absorption properties
of the green and yellow variants (Figure 4B), which exhibited different ratios of the
GFP-type chromophore in its ionized state at approximately 488 nm
and its neutral state at approximately 382 nm. Although the absorbance
properties of green and yellow variants were very similar, their phenotype
was clearly different, as shown in the streaked colonies in Figure 4A. Because green
variants were colored but nonfluorescent, perhaps their chromophores
achieved a trans configuration around the double bond formed between
the Cα and Cβ of Tyr64 (equivalent to Tyr66 in GFP) during
the oxidation step, whereas the yellow variants achieved a cis configuration.
It is well known that most nonfluorescent chromoproteins display a
GFP-type chromophore in the trans configuration, whereas most fluorescent
proteins display a chromophore with cis configuration.55,56

Here, it is important to mention that emKate’s chromophore
was formed by post-translational modification of the amino acids Met63,
Tyr64, and Gly65, whose equivalent positions in the reference GFP
protein are Ser65, Tyr66, and Gly67. In this context, all amino acid
changes that gave rise to drastic changes of phenotypes compared with
the red color of emKate were located on the vicinity of the chromophore,
either on the α-helix holding the chromophore or on amino acid
positions located on the β-strands surrounding the chromophore,
whose side-chains face the interior of the β-barrel and are
near the chromophore. For instance, the yellow phenotype of emKate-yellow1
was generated by the mutation S66G, adjacent to the chromophore moiety,
whereas the green and orange phenotypes found in emKate-green1 and
emKate-orange1 were generated, respectively, by mutations Q39H and
A158V (Figure S2), located in β-strands
2 and 7.

These substitutions probably caused the loss of hydrogen
bonds
with the chromophore or crowded that region, disturbing the appropriate
conformation of the GFP-like intermediate and hampered the second
oxidation step, which would produce the red chromophore.57 Surprisingly, a green shift was also found in
a variant containing the external mutation A142P, which presumably
destabilized the β-barrel, causing loss of the hydrogen bond
between the phenolate ion of the chromophore and Ser143. The alteration
of the H-bond network results in the destabilization of the cis configuration
and probably neutralization of the phenolate.58

Conclusions
In this study, we describe a new method
to perform random mutagenesis
that we call the Spiked Genes method, and we compared its efficiency
against that of enzymatic epPCR mutagenesis methods. Using oligonucleotides
with 0.75% mutant nucleotides at each position, we obtained a mutant
library that (with respect to other methods) showed: first, a higher
control of mutation rate; second, a wider and homogeneous mutation
distribution along the entire gene; and third, a more even mutation
diversity, with minimal mutation bias. Moreover, our method can be
modulated to achieve the desired mutation and transition/transversion
ratios. In this era of synthetic biology, the continuous drop in the
price of oligonucleotides makes this random mutagenesis strategy a
suitable option for the improvement of protein properties. The power
of the strategy was manifested in the high phenotypic variations found
in the library. We have created a rich library of emKate variant proteins
that once characterized could potentially be used as reporters of
cellular processes.

Methods
Oligonucleotide Synthesis
All oligonucleotides used
for the gene library assembly, forward and reverse (shown in Table S1), were synthesized with a MerMade 192
DNA synthesizer (BioAutomation), using standard DMTr-protected phosphoramidites
dABz, dCAc, dGdmf, and dT. However,
contrary to conventional synthesis, each nucleotide was doped with
0.25% of each of the other three nucleotides, producing an overall
contamination of 0.75% per base. After deprotection and analysis by
denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, all oligonucleotides
were observed as a single band and were used for the subsequent experiments
without further purification.

Library of Synthetic Genes
Encoding emKate
The library
of synthetic genes encoding emKate (accession number EU383029, DNA
Data Bank of Japan) was assembled in a single PCR step, as described
in a previous report.37 Oligonucleotides
in one strand were designed to overlap 30 nt with the oligonucleotides
in the complementary strand. To improve gene expression, the least
frequent E. coli codons were substituted
with more frequently used codons. An overlapping extension was carried
out using an equimolar pool of the 22 internal oligonucleotides as
templates (mFw2 to mFw12 and mRv1 to mRv11) (Table S1). Three different equimolar concentrations of the internal
oligonucleotides were tested (4, 8, and 16 nM), plus 400 nM of the
outermost primers (mFw1 and mRv12), which, for cloning purposes, also
included NdeI and Xhol restriction
sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the synthetic genes,
respectively. mRv12 also contained the information to introduce a
polyhistidine tag −SGGSHHHHHH at the carboxy end of the variant
proteins. The final 100 μL of PCR mixture had Vent DNA polymerase
(New England BioLabs), buffer, MgSO4, and dNTPs, as recommended
by the supplier. The PCR reaction was performed under the following
conditions: 1 cycle: 94 °C for 3 min; 25 cycles: 94 °C for
1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min; 1 cycle: 72 °C
for 5 min.

Both the gene library and the pJOQ plasmid were double-digested
with the NdeI and XhoI restriction
endonucleases for 12 h at 37 °C and purified from agarose gel,
using the EZ-10 spin column PCR purification kit (Bio Basic Inc.).
Next, 200 ng of the gene library was ligated into 200 ng of the vector
in a 20 μL reaction at 16 °C for 20 h. Using electroporation,
2 μL of the ligation reaction was used to transform 100 μL
of MC1061 E. coli cells. After recovering
in 1 mL of LB media at 37 °C for 1 h, the transformed cells were
grown at 37 °C for 20 h on LB-Kanamycin plates. After transformation,
plasmids from several independent colonies (fluorescent and nonfluorescent)
were isolated for DNA sequencing.

Enzymatic Mutagenesis
The wild-type gene emKate was subjected to three
different epPCR-based mutagenesis approaches,
two using commercial kits and one established in our laboratory. We
followed the instructions to obtain the highest mutation rate recommended
for two commercial kits: 16/kb for the GeneMorph II mutagenesis kit
from Stratagene and 8/kb for the Diversify PCR Random Mutagenesis
Kit from Clontech. As a third protocol, we evaluated the classical
epPCR approach at the predicted mutation rate of 6.6/kb, as described
by Cadwell and Joyce.20 All libraries generated
from the three epPCR methods were cloned, selected, and evaluated,
as previously described for the synthetic library.
