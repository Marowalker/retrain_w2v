Fe2As has been studied in
situ by synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) over
the range of temperatures 25–850 °C and under a neutral
atmosphere to understand its thermal behavior, which is potentially
important for gold extraction. For the first time, incongruent high-temperature
reactions of Fe2As are observed as it breaks down and the
existence of a previously undiscovered high-temperature FeAs phase
with an NiAs-type structure has been determined experimentally. No
evidence has been found for the existence of the high-temperature
Fe3As2 phase. Hence, the previously published
phase diagram for the Fe–As system has to be modified accordingly.

Introduction
Due to resource depletion
of easily processed nonferrous and precious
metals, metallurgical processing is increasingly moving toward refractory
ores and concentrates with high arsenic (As) content. In this regard,
the problem of As removal, and countering the problems it adds to
the technological process of obtaining end product metals, becomes
absolutely critical.

Iron arsenides may be the key to the extraction
of gold from double
refractory gold–arsenic-bearing carbonaceous ores, where gold
is not extractable without significant ecological contamination from
the associated arsenopyrite mineralization. By processing under reducing
atmospheres in the presence of an iron-rich slag, certain proposed
direct reductive melting (DRM) processes lock As into iron arsenide
phases.1 The effectiveness of As removal
from arsenic-bearing gold concentrates is directly associated with
the decomposition of such iron arsenides. Hence, the development of
the DRM process demands an improved fundamental understanding of the
thermal behavior of the iron–arsenic phases of interest, especially
the main constituent Fe2As diiron arsenide. There is no
information on the thermal behavior of diiron arsenide in reducing
and inert atmospheres, which are characteristic of the conditions
of the DRM process.

Fe–As System
Initial interest
in the Fe–As
system originated from the need to minimize the negative ecological
and environmental impacts of As resulting from metallurgical processing
since it often accompanies nonferrous and precious metals in sulfidic
ores. The application of As-containing compounds in electronic devices
and the discovery of their thermoelectric and superconducting properties
fueled further interest in the Fe–As system.

The Fe–As
system has been extensively reviewed by Okamoto.2 The phase diagram of the Fe–As system is shown in Figure 1. The phases are
α-As, FeAs2, FeAs, Fe3As2,
Fe2As, α-Fe, and γ-Fe. The existence of a high-temperature
Fe3As2 phase was previously postulated but never
confirmed experimentally.2

Figure 1 Phase diagram of the
Fe–As system adapted from Okamoto.2 Line phases are shown in dark blue at room temperature
and alternatively colored where polymorphs occur at high temperatures.
The postulated stability field of the Fe3As2 phase is indicated.

The known minerals occurring
in this system are loellingite (FeAs2) and westerveldite
(FeAs). Crystallographic data of previously
reported iron arsenides stable at room temperature are given in Table 1.

The congruent melting points
of FeAs2, FeAs, and Fe2As are 1020,6 1030,7 and 919 °C7 (or 930 °C8),
respectively. A high-temperature study of the
stoichiometric FeAs phase showed that the MnP-type crystal structure
remains virtually unchanged up to 1300 K (1027 °C).9 A high-pressure X-ray study of an FeAs single
crystal did not reveal any deviation from the MnP structure throughout
the applied pressure range.10

Studies on
the Thermal Behavior of Iron Arsenides
Previous
studies on the thermal behavior of iron arsenides under various atmospheres
had two principal aims: first, a better understanding of dearsenication
mechanisms of refractory gold–arsenic-bearing ores and concentrates
and the optimization of gold recovery technologies and second, attempts
to improve the commercial production of high-purity As in a vacuum.
Information on the thermal behavior of iron arsenides in reducing
and neutral atmospheres is very limited. Earlier studies on the thermal
behavior of natural loellingite (FeAs2) at 450–800
°C and one atmospheric pressure reported that loellingite decomposes
with the release of As and formation of FeAs.11 The thermal behavior of synthetic iron arsenides under vacuum (<0.0106
kPa) was studied by Tkach et al.12 Heating
of the 0.074–0.14 mm grain-sized material at a rate of 10°
min–1 indicated the following mechanism of decomposition: 1  In contrast, Isabayev et al.13 observed only one endothermic effect at 940
°C from
the differential thermal analysis (DTA) curve of a synthetic iron
diarsenide heated under a helium atmosphere.

A thorough investigation
of the thermal behavior of iron arsenides FeAs2 and FeAs
in a vacuum has been conducted previously.14 Arsenides were prepared by sintering a mixture of metallic arsenic
and iron in evacuated quartz ampoules. The resulting synthetic iron
diarsenide, according to the mineralogical and X-ray structure analyses,
contained about 10% FeAs and had the formula Fe1.05As1.95. The synthesized iron monoarsenide contained about 2%
FeAs2. An exothermic peak at 320–350 °C and
an endothermic effect at 650–640 °C, accompanied by a
loss of weight, were observed in the DTA analysis of FeAs2. The endothermic effect was attributed to the decomposition of iron
diarsenide. The DTA study of FeAs showed an exothermic peak at 340–360
°C and an endothermic peak at 630–650 °C, accompanied
by a slight decrease in mass. A noticeable loss of weight was observed
at 820–830 °C. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and electron
probe micro-analysis (EPMA) of the solid products of monoarsenide
decomposition at temperatures above 800 °C revealed the presence
of Fe2As. Diarsenide dissociation was investigated by in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction when heating
in a vacuum of 0.1 Pa over a temperature range of 25–900 °C.
X-ray patterns were taken every 50–100 °C. It was found
that FeAs2 decomposition commences at 400 °C and ends
at 600 °C with the formation of FeAs. Visible decomposition of
FeAs was observed at 650 °C and was completed above 800 °C
with the formation of diiron arsenide Fe2As as a solid
phase. The authors arrived at the conclusion that the thermal dissociation
of iron diarsenide under vacuum has a stepwise nature 2   3   4   5  Thus, as
is present in the form of diiron
arsenide in the residues of thermal decomposition of arsenopyrite
and iron arsenides at temperatures above 900–1200 °C,
heated in an inert atmosphere or vacuum.12,14,15

Thus far, however, no single study
has reported the thermal behavior
of diiron arsenide. Hence, data on the thermal behavior of Fe2As in neutral and reducing atmospheres, which are characteristic
of the conditions of any proposed DRM process, are essential. The
aim of this study is to fill this gap in our understanding and study
the thermal behavior of diiron arsenide by conducting in situ high-temperature synchrotron XRD of diiron arsenide. This is the
first high-temperature structural study of Fe2As.

Results
and Discussion
The PXRD patterns of the Fe2As
sample (Figure 2) show
three noticeable phase
transformations in the sample upon heating. The sample composition
remains unchanged until about 300 °C, when magnetite, Fe3O4, and FeAs are formed. The second phase transformation
in the system occurs at around 650 °C, where magnetite transforms
into wuestite FeO (Figure 3). It is known that, under low oxygen fugacity, magnetite
is more stable than wuestite at lower temperatures.16 The magnetite reaction to produce wuestite probably involves
the consumption of Fe2As and further formation of FeAs
according to reaction 6 6  The final transformation takes place at 800
°C, when the known phase of FeAs disappears to be replaced by
a phase displaying new unidentified peaks that appear in the PXRD
plot (Figure 2). These
unidentified peaks disappear upon subsequent cooling below 650 °C,
at which point the phase reverts to the familiar structure of FeAs
as seen during heating. The peaks were found to belong to a new high-temperature
polymorph of FeAs (see below).

sample upon heating and cooling.

refinement of the PXRD patterns of Fe2As. The
experimental (black), calculated (red), and difference (gray) curves
are shown. Peak marks: red—Fe2As, blue—FeAs,
green—Fe3O4, and black—FeO.

Experimental, calculated, and difference curves
of the final fit
for three representative temperature steps for the experiment performed
with the Fe2As sample are shown in Figure 3. It should be noted that the formation of
very minor amounts of silicate phases (including fayalite) arises
during the experiment as a result of chemical reactions between the
iron arsenide compound(s) with the silica glass tube walls of the
capillary container.

Crystal Structure Solution of a New High-Temperature
Phase of
FeAs
At 800 °C, the diffraction peaks corresponding
to the MnP-type phase of FeAs disappear and some new peaks develop
in the pattern. Upon closer analysis, most of these new peaks were
in fact triplets and only a few minor ones were single peaks (Figure 4a,b). The single
peaks were identified as fayalite. It is known that at low oxygen
fugacity, wuestite reacts with SiO2 (present as the capillary
wall) to form silicates.17 7  This distinction was possible because of the
excellent data quality. The interpretation is that a new phase has
grown as three individual large single crystals and triplet reflections
were caused by quasi-single-crystal scattering artifacts; when one
or a few bigger crystals are present in the polycrystalline powder
in a 0.1 mm thick capillary, their reflections appear to be shifted
compared to the expected peak position. Such quasi-single-crystal
peak intensities are also affected strongly by the preferred orientation
as their orientation is not randomized. No known iron and/or arsenic
compound matches the new triplet peaks, including oxides and silicates.

Figure 4 Example
of parts of the diffraction patterns of our sample at 800
°C: (a) single peak and (b) triplet peaks.

Therefore, the triplet peaks were carefully selected and fitted
using a single pseudo-Voigt peak shape. The peak positions and intensities
thus calculated were extracted together with the background to produce
a synthetic diffraction pattern (Figure 5). As Figure 6 shows, there is virtually no overlap between the triplet
peaks and the other peaks in the diffraction pattern. Indexing in
cubic, hexagonal, trigonal, and tetragonal symmetries was attempted
with the indexing algorithm DICVOL,18 which
is included in the software DASH19 from
the CCDC suite.20

The observed (black), calculated (red), and difference (gray) patterns
and peak marks for a new phase are shown. The observed pattern has
been obtained by fitting the triplet unidentified peaks of the data
obtained at 800 °C with single pseudo-Voigt peaks.

Among others, a hexagonal unit cell with a volume of 73 Å3 gave an excellent Pawley fit, yielding a and c equal to 3.9439(4) and 5.3897(6) Å,
respectively. Space group statistics suggested a 63 screw
axis along [0 0 1] and a c glide plane
along [1 1 0]. A Pawley fit using space group P63/mmc—one of the most
common space groups in the ICSD database21—gave the same χ2 as for space group P6. Before attempting any structure solution trial, we searched
in the ICSD database for compounds with cell parameters similar to
our refined results to within 3%. Amongst a number of binary compounds
with a nickeline (NiAs)-type structure, a CoTe phase (ICSD collection
code 53090), isostructural to nickeline (NiAs),22 was found. Atoms were replaced with Fe and As in the corresponding
atomic positions. As can be seen from Figure 5, this structure fitted the experimental
data well. The difference curve shows that some of the peaks are slightly
shifted (see the inset in Figure 5). Rather than a problem with the cell symmetry and
parameters, we believe that this is due to the way this synthetic
pattern was created from an experimental powder pattern affected by
single-crystal artifacts. Assuming that this high-temperature FeAs
phase is in fact dominated by three big single crystals, then these
crystals would most likely be oriented differently. A misorientation
between the crystals also combines with the preferred orientation
effect, yielding different intensity ratios for different triplets.
This affects the synthetic pattern peak positions giving rise to relatively
minor misfit features in the final Rietveld plot (see the difference
profile of the Figure 5 inset). A Rietveld refinement on this synthetic pattern converged
with χ2, Rwp, and RBragg equal to 0.86, 5.76%, and 3.47%, respectively.

A transition from an MnP-type to a high-temperature NiAs-type structure
has been observed previously for many transition metal arsenides including
TiAs, VAs, CrAs, (Mn,Fe)As, CoAs, and NiAs. Heyding and Calvert mentioned
the possibility of a phase transition in FeAs below its melting point.
However, they were not able to obtain satisfactory diffraction data,
due to the attack of the silica capillaries above 900 °C.17 Selte et al. did not observe any structural
changes in FeAs up to its melting point at 1070 ± 20 °C
in their X-ray and neutron diffraction studies.9 However, in their later work, Selte et al. suggested the
possibility of phase transition in FeAs.23 Although the existence of this high-temperature NiAs-like structure
for FeAs was suggested, it has never before been experimentally observed
for pure FeAs. Its stability field is indicated by the red portion
of the line phase of FeAs shown above in Figure 1.

The two different crystal structures
are given in Figure 7 for comparison. It should
be noted that the NiAs-type FeAs phase found here is only stable over
a very limited temperature range. The variation in the phase composition
of our sample as a function of temperature is given in Figure 8.

Figure 7 Crystal structures of
FeAs phases: MnP-type (top) projected along
the a axis and NiAs-type (bottom) projected along
the c axis. As atoms and Fe atoms are light gray
and dark gray, respectively.

Figure 8 Composition
of our sample as a function of temperature as obtained
from the Rietveld analysis. The estimated standard deviations were
found to be smaller than the symbols.

Finally, based on the phase diagram of the Fe–As system
given by Okamoto,2 and taking into account
the experimental conditions (heating up to 850 °C and inert atmosphere)
as well as the composition of the sample, the following phases can
be identified in the studied sample: FeAs, Fe2As, Fe3As2, and α-Fe (Figure 1). However, in this study, we found no evidence
for the presence of an HT Fe3As2 phase. The
stability field of Fe3As2 has always been considered
ambiguous.2 The existence of Fe3As2 below 800 °C was initially proposed by Friedrich.7 Hagg believed that a high-temperature Fe3As2 phase was stable only above 795 °C.4 Heyding and Calvert found no indication of the
high-temperature Fe3As2 phase in iron–arsenic
alloys quenched from temperatures above 800 °C17 but did not attempt to do experiments above 795 °C.
According to Sawamura and Mori, Fe3As2 decomposes
eutectoidally at 824 °C.8 Earlier
studies were conducted ex situ on heated and quenched
or cooled products. This hinders access to intermediate transformation
products and therefore could not provide information about the full
process of phase transformation. Our in situ PXRD
experiment did not suggest the existence of the high-temperature Fe3As2 phase at temperatures from 795 to 850 °C
(Figure 1).

those obtained in this study are given in the Supporting Information

of cell parameters and volume of FeAs with temperature was calculated
according to expression 8 and is in good agreement with the data reported by Selte et al.9 (Table 2). 8

Conclusions
Our temperature-dependent study of a starting diiron arsenide compound
allowed ambiguities in the Fe–As binary system to be resolved.
For the first time, the existence of a high-temperature FeAs phase
with an NiAs-type structure has been demonstrated. In addition, no
experimental evidence is found for the presence of a high-temperature
Fe3As2 phase. Hence, the phase diagram for the
system Fe–As has to be modified accordingly.

Preliminary in situ high-temperature PXRD data
and identification of various phases upon thermal dissociation of
diiron arsenide provide evidence related to phase transformations
of iron arsenides upon heating, which is important in defining the
thermodynamic state of these materials in real applications.

Experimental
Methods
In situ high-temperature powder
X-ray diffraction
was conducted at the Materials Science Beamline of the Swiss Light
Source (SLS) of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland.24 This diffractometer yielded an exceptionally
high angular resolution and data quality; despite the small binning
step (0.0036°), some of the sharpest peaks appeared undersampled,
with less than five data points above the half maximum (inset in Figure 3). This complicated
the peak fitting somewhat. Nevertheless, the data quality allowed
for high precision cell parameters to be determined and the identification
of unexpected high-temperature phases including a new previously unreported
high-temperature phase of FeAs. The experiments were performed at
the powder diffraction station of X04SA using monochromatic radiation
(λ = 0.56502 Å). The starting FeAs2 samples
were ground using a mortar and a pestle manually, sieved through a
75 μm sieve, mixed, and weighed. The preparation of the samples
required the use of a glovebag under nitrogen to prevent the oxidation
of As. The experiments simulated the conditions of the DRM process.
Samples of 99.5% Fe2As (commercial, Alfa Aesar) were thus
loaded under nitrogen into quartz capillaries with an internal diameter
of 0.1 mm and sealed. Phase changes were monitored throughout the
heating and cooling profile by in situ PXRD.

Raw diffraction data were processed and merged using in-house software.
The structural changes associated with limits of stability were determined
by Rietveld analysis. Parametric Rietveld refinements were performed
using Topas V4.1.25 Parameters of the Mythen
detector position and intensity correction model, the specimen displacement,
the divergence slit, and the instrumental contribution for peak broadening
using the Gaussian parameters of a pseudo-Voigt function were refined
globally against the entirety of all datasets. This lowers the corresponding
estimated standard deviations because of the larger number of observations
and minimizes the overall number of free parameters. Simultaneously,
background, phase compositions, unit cell dimensions, and microstrain-related
Lorentzian peak broadening were refined individually for all phases
at all temperatures. March–Dollase preferred-orientation corrections
were applied to the (0 0 1) plane of Fe2As.
The background was modeled with a Chebyshev polynomial function refined
using 10 parameters. The refinements converged with a χ2 of 9.70–18.08 and an Rwp of 6.70–12.08. The starting structural data were taken from
the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).26
