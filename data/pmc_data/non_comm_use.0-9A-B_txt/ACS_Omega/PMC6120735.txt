This
article reports the fabrication of organic solvent nanofiltration
membranes containing a labile disulfide bond, which is broken by reaction
with a chemical stimulus. These membranes are a new generation of
smart membranes that have tailored selectivities and flux that can
be altered by reacting with a chemical stimulus. The selectivity and
flux of chemicals through the membranes was controlled by varying
the concentration of disulfide bonds in the membrane. When the disulfide
bonds were cleaved, the pores in the membrane became larger and yielded
different separation properties. The membrane selectivity was changed
by up to 70% and flux was increased up to 5×. The rapid change
in selectivity of the membrane allowed for the separation of three-component
mixtures. A three-component mixture of 33.3% m-dinitrobenzene,
33.3% triphenylmethane, and 33.3% 1,3,5-tris(diphenylamino)benzene
(TDAB) was separated into three different fractions that were significantly
enriched in one of the three molecules. The first fraction contained m-dinitrobenzene at 82% purity and 84% yield, the second
fraction contained triphenylmethane at 67% purity and 49% yield, and
the third fraction contained TDAB at 71% purity and 88% yield.

1 Introduction
The
chemical industry is critically important worldwide with chemical
sales in the United States alone reaching $800 billion in 2015.1 In order to produce high-quality chemicals and
products, chemicals are purified using many different methods including
distillation, chromatography, crystallization, liquid–liquid
extraction, sublimation, and much more.2 Chemical separations account for as much as 15% of the total global
energy consumption.3−5 In part due to these costs, energy efficiency is
one of the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry that are widely recognized
as important principles to guide the future of chemistry in academic
and industrial settings.6−11 Membrane-based separations are attractive alternatives to distillations
and other energy intensive separation methods and can be applied to
chemicals that do not form crystals, do not sublime, or are challenging
to purify with other methods. One of the emerging fields in membrane
science is organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN),12 which is concerned with the separation of chemicals with
molecular weights ranging from 100 to 1000 g mol–1 in organic solvents. Many important chemicals have molecular weights
that fall in this range such as catalysts, ligands, solvents, monomers
used to make plastics, and pharmaceutical drugs. The purification
of these chemicals is important for companies to produce high-quality
products, as impurities can significantly affect how materials function
or how drugs react in the body. OSN is a promising alternative for
chemical separations that can save energy and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions when compared to a more conventional technique such as distillation.13,14

Membranes separate mixtures into a retentate and permeate;
if two
chemicals are present then each chemical may be isolated in high purity.
If the initial mixture has three or more chemicals, then typically
only one chemical will be isolated in high purity unless multiple
membranes with different separation properties are used in a membrane
cascade.15 Despite the need for membranes
that can separate more than two chemicals, this area of research is
understudied, with only one example in the recent literature involving
OSN.16 This study used a molecularly imprinted
membrane (MIM) to separate a three-component mixture of an active
pharmaceutical ingredient (API), a catalyst, and the API building
block. However, when the selective sites in the MIM reached saturation,
the membrane lost selectivity.

In this article, we report a
new method of controlling flux and
selectivity in OSN membranes by fabricating new membranes which incorporate
disulfide bonds into cross-linked epoxy nanofiltration membranes.
Cleavage of the disulfide bond changes the separation properties of
the membranes, and incorporating different concentrations of disulfide
bonds in the membrane allows for control over the changes in selectivity
and flux of chemicals. We also report the application of these membranes
to isolate three chemicals in significantly enhanced purity from a
three-component mixture.

Research on membranes that can change
pore sizes has received increasing
attention in recent years.17−20 Membranes can respond to various stimuli such as
pH,21 temperature,22 light,23 electricity,24 and magnetism.25 These membranes
are highly desired because they give the user control over flux and
selectivity, which are two of the most important characteristics of
a membrane. Both properties are controlled by membrane pore size,
and in a stimulus-sensitive membrane the pore size can either decrease
or increase in response to specific stimuli.

To the best of
our knowledge, there has not been a report of a
membrane with cleavable disulfide bonds, despite the fact that disulfides
have been incorporated into other smart materials such as self-healing
polymers26,27 and reprocessable thermosets.28 Disulfide bonds are easily cleaved through chemical
or thermal processes, which makes them excellent candidates for incorporation
into a membrane.

In this paper, we report the fabrication of
epoxy nanofiltration
membranes with cleavable disulfide bonds using a one-pot step polymerization
with a diepoxide and a mixture of two dianilines (Figure 1a). The reaction between amines
and epoxides creates a highly cross-linked polymer membrane rich in
disulfide bonds, and the space between the physical and chemical cross-links
forms the pores within the membrane. Chemicals diffuse into the membrane
and through the space between the cross-links to permeate the membrane.
A chemical stimulus is used to cleave the disulfide bonds and open
up the pores in the membrane (Figure 1b,c). The change in flux and selectivity of chemicals
through the membrane is dependent on how many disulfide bonds are
cleaved during exposure to a chemical stimulus.

Figure 1 (a) Chemical reaction
between two monomers to synthesize a cross-linked
polymer membrane is shown. The disulfide bonds are intact when the
membrane is fabricated. (b) Photograph of an epoxy membrane with cleavable
disulfide bonds showing the color change after treatment with a chemical
stimulus. Only the center part of the membrane was exposed to the
stimulus and the yellow polymer was completely etched away leaving
behind the white, inert solid support. (c) Chemical structure of the
polymer membrane after it has been treated with a chemical stimulus.
The disulfide bonds have been cleaved to thiols.

We also report how these membranes were used to produce three
purity-enriched
streams of chemicals from a three-component mixture using one membrane.
After collecting the first chemical in high purity, the disulfide
bonds in the membrane were cleaved to increase the pore size and the
second, larger chemical permeated the membrane in high purity. The
third chemical was too large to permeate the membrane, so it was rejected
by the membrane and retained in high purity.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Selection of Monomers for
Epoxy Nanofiltration
Membranes with Disulfide Bonds and Characterization of the Membranes
Various diamines and diepoxides were investigated for their ability
to fabricate epoxy membranes that were robust but permeable for selected
chemicals (Figure 2). All membranes were fabricated with a 1:1 mole ratio of NH bonds
to epoxides, yielding a highly cross-linked polymer network. Chemicals
diffuse into the membrane and through the physical and chemical cross-links
which make up the pores of the membrane.

Figure 2 (a) Amines and (b) epoxides
that were screened in the fabrication
of epoxy nanofiltration membranes.

Attempted synthesis of diamine A, which bears a disulfide,
began
with transesterification of 3,3′-dithiopropionic acid to the
diester, which proceeded smoothly in 91% yield. Treatment of the diester
with ethylenediamine to form diamine A proved unsuccessful, as the
primary amines of ethylene diamine reacted with the aliphatic disulfide.
Because the aliphatic disulfide was unstable in the presence of primary
amines, an aromatic disulfide monomer was investigated. Commercially
available dianiline B (4-aminophenyldisulfide) was stable in the presence
of a primary amine for over a month (Figure S1). Fabrication of membranes using dianiline B and diepoxide 1 yielded
membranes that were brittle and showed little permeation of chemicals
(<1%) through the membrane after 10 d (Table S1). However, use of epoxide 2 in the polymerization allowed
chemicals to permeate the membrane (Table S2).

Incorporating a chemically responsive bond, such as a disulfide
bond, in the membrane allows modification of the cross-links and pores
in the membrane. If a membrane is fabricated with 100% disulfide monomer
in the polymerization, the membrane will completely dissolve upon
cleavage of the disulfide bond. If a membrane is fabricated with 50%
of disulfide monomer and 50% of a comonomer that does not bear a disulfide,
only 50% of the cross-links will break, leaving behind a cross-linked
membrane with much larger pores. After cleavage of the cross-links
in a membrane, the separation properties will change, and the degree
of this change is controlled by varying the molar equivalents of disulfide
comonomer used in the fabrication of the membranes.

To make
testable variations on this membrane, it was necessary
to select a diamine that had epoxide reactivity similar to that of
monomer B. Dianilines D and E were mostly unreactive with epoxide
2 and were unable to form a solid membrane after 2 weeks at 60 °C.
These results are likely due to the fact that both monomers possess
strong deactivating groups between the aromatic rings. By contrast,
dianiline C has an activating ethylene group between the two aromatic
groups, and polymerization with epoxide 2 was successful, allowing
chemicals to permeate the membrane (Table S3).

Diepoxide monomer 2 and diamine monomers B and C were then
used
in the polymerizations or copolymerizations to fabricate epoxy nanofiltration
membranes. Membranes are henceforth referred to by a simplified nomenclature.
For example, a membrane fabricated with diamine B and diepoxide 2
is referred to as membrane B-2. If a mixture of the diamine comonomers
B and C is used, the membrane is referred to as BaCb-2, where the superscripts denote
the molar equivalents of the comonomers. For example, membrane B1C3-2 would contain 25% of monomer B, and 75% monomer
C.

The thickness of the membranes was characterized via scanning
electron
microscopy (SEM). A membrane was fractured to obtain a cross-sectional
image that showed the epoxy membrane fabricated on top of the solid
support (Figure 3a).
SEM micrographs showed that the thicknesses of the epoxy membranes
were approximately 1 μm.

(b) FT-IR spectra
of the epoxide peaks at different times during the fabrication of
membrane C-2.

The polymerization reaction
was monitored by Fourier-transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy by observing the decrease in % transmittance
of the epoxide peaks at 910 and 860 cm–1 (Figure 3b).29,30 The reactions were deemed complete when there was no further change
in the spectra for the peaks at 910 and 860 cm–1. The fabrication of membrane C-2 was completed within 5 d because
the FT-IR spectra collected at 8 d overlapped with the 5 d spectra.
The reaction to form membrane B-2 was completed within 7 d (Figure S2), and the fabrication of membranes
B3C1-2, B1C1-2, and B1C3-2 was also monitored by FT-IR and they reached
completion within 7 d (Figure S3–S5).

2.2 Selection of Chemical Stimulus To Break the
Disulfide Bonds
It was important to select a chemical stimulus
that would cleave the disulfide bonds, while retaining membrane integrity.
Cleavage of the disulfide bonds would result in a large increase in
flux because of the large increase in the size of the membrane pores.
Cysteamine was investigated for its ability to cleave the disulfide
bonds and break the cross-links in the membrane. Cysteamine was chosen
because it is a small chemical that was expected to have a rapid flux
through the membranes, and it is well known for its ability to cleave
disulfide bonds in biology. Initial experiments with membrane B-2
and cysteamine were promising based on the color change of the membranes.
The membrane was off-yellow, but after the center part of the membrane
was exposed to cysteamine in dichloromethane (DCM) the yellow color
disappeared and the white solid support was visible (see Figure 1b). This is due to
cysteamine cleaving all of the disulfide bonds, which breaks the cross-links
and dissolves the membrane.

The use of cysteamine to break the
disulfide bonds in the membranes was investigated by several methods.
First, the flux of pNB was investigated before and after treatment
with cysteamine for membranes B-2 and C-2 as control experiments (Figure 4a,e). If all of the
disulfide cross-links in membrane B-2 were cleaved, the membrane would
wash away as soluble organic chemicals, and membrane C-2 should remain
unchanged because it contains no disulfide bonds. The flux of pNB
through membrane B-2 was 4.7× faster after treatment with cysteamine,
but the flux was unchanged through membrane C-2 after treatment with
cysteamine. Flux was determined following a previous procedure.31

Figure 4 Flux before treatment with cysteamine and after treatment
with
cysteamine for membranes (a) C-2, (b) B1C3-2,
(c) B1C1-2, (d) B3C1-2,
and (e) B-2. The chemicals were pNB, triethylamine (Et3N), tripropylamine (Pr3N), and TPM.

Next, the flux of pNB, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and
triphenylmethane
(TPM) through intact membranes B-2 and C-2 was investigated. The relative
flux of these chemicals was measured for separations through membranes
B-2 and C-2, and the results in Figure 4 demonstrate that their rates of permeation decreased
in progression from pNB, to triethylamine, to tripropylamine, and
to TPM. This result is understood based on the different sizes of
these chemicals as described elsewhere.32 When the membranes were exposed to cysteamine for 18 h and the separation
of the chemicals were investigated, the relative flux of the chemicals
was unchanged for membrane C-2 but changed dramatically for membrane
B-2. The relative flux of the chemicals through membrane B-2 after
treatment with cysteamine was very similar to the relative flux of
chemicals through the solid support in the absence of any epoxy membrane.

Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the disulfide bond
in the membranes before and after exposure to cysteamine by investigation
of two peaks that were unique to the disulfide monomer (Figure 5a,b). The peak at 480 cm–1 was unique to the disulfide bond and the peak at
1600 cm–1 was only present in the spectrum for membranes
fabricated with the disulfide monomer. Neither was present in the
spectrum for membrane C-2 that did not contain any disulfide bonds
(Figure S6).33 The peak at 1600 cm–1 was a shoulder peak to the
peak at 1620 cm–1; both peaks were due to the aromatic
ring vibrations, and the peak at 1620 cm–1 was seen
in the spectra for both membranes B-2 and C-2. The disappearance of
the peaks at 480 and 1600 cm–1 demonstrated that
the disulfide bonds were no longer present in the membrane. Figure 5a shows the Raman
spectra for membrane B1C1-2 before treating
with cysteamine, with both peaks at 480 and 1600 cm–1 showing strong intensities. Following treatment with cysteamine
for 3 h, another Raman spectrum was collected and there was a significant
decrease in both peaks related to the disulfide bond. The disulfide
peak at 480 cm–1 has decreased by 68%, and the aromatic
peak from the S–S had been reduced to a small shoulder to the
left of the larger peak at 1620 cm–1. Longer reaction
times did not reduce the peak at 480 cm–1. Raman
spectra were collected for all membranes used in this study before
and after treatment with cysteamine (Figures S6–13). After characterizing the cleavage of the disulfide bonds, the
membranes were investigated for their ability to separate chemicals
before and after cleavage of the disulfide bonds.

2.3 Selectivity in Epoxy Nanofiltration
Membranes
before and after Cleaving the Disulfide Bonds
To investigate
how the cleavage of disulfide bonds affected the selectivities of
membranes, they were fabricated with 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mol %
of diamine monomer B. By varying the amount of the disulfide in the
membrane, we controlled the number of cleavable cross-links in the
membrane and thus controlled the change in selectivity and flux. It
was hypothesized that membranes containing more disulfide bonds would
show a larger increase in flux and a loss of selectivity after the
disulfide bond was cleaved.

In nanofiltration, the two models
most commonly used to describe the flux of chemicals through a membrane
are the solution-diffusion model34 and
the pore-flow model.35 In this report,
we will use the solution-diffusion model to describe the permeation
of chemicals through the membrane, both for its simplicity and because
the chemicals were separated in a diffusion-based separation apparatus
(Figure S14). Chemicals were dissolved
in DCM and added to the retentate side of the diffusion apparatus.

The concentration of chemicals in the permeate stream was monitored
using 1H NMR spectroscopy and used to determine the relative
and absolute flux of the chemicals through the membrane before treatment
with cysteamine (Figures 4 and S5–S10). For the membrane
series of B1C3-2, B1C1-2, and B3C1-2, the selectivities for pNB to
TPM increased from 12.4:1, to 14:1, and up to 15.9:1. As the selectivity
of this membrane series increased, the flux of pNB through the membrane
decreased (Figure 6a). One possible reason for this decrease was that membranes containing
more of monomer C had lower conversions of the epoxide functional
group, as determined by FT-IR spectroscopy (Table S4). The density of cross-links decreased as the conversion
of the reaction between epoxides and amines decreased.

Figure 6 (a) Flux of pNB through
the membranes before and after treatment
with cysteamine is shown. (b) Graph showing the relative increase
in flux of pNB through the membrane, and the % decrease in selectivity
for pNB over TPM after the disulfide bonds were cleaved. The red data
points correspond to the right axis and represent the decrease in
selectivity for pNB to TPM, and the green data points correspond to
the left axis and represent the increase in flux for pNB through the
membrane.

This decrease in density of cross-links
would yield larger pores
consistent with a faster flux of pNB through the membrane and a lower
selectivity for pNB over TPM. After characterizing the flux and selectivities
of chemicals through the membranes before exposure to a chemical stimulus,
the membranes were treated with cysteamine. Using the initial data
as a baseline, a clear difference in flux in pNB was observed before
and after the disulfide bonds were broken in each membrane. This was
consistent with the existence of larger pores after reaction with
cysteamine (Figures 6a and S5–10). As more disulfide
bonds were broken, the membranes showed a greater increase in flux
for pNB (Figure 6a).
For the membrane series B1C3-2, B1C1-2, and B3C1-2, the flux of pNB
was 1.1×, 2.2×, and 5.3× faster when compared to the
membranes that had the cross-links still intact (Figure 6b). This result demonstrates
that the flux and selectivities of chemicals through the membranes
were altered by adding a chemical stimulus (Table 1).

relative error.

The selectivity
of the membranes also decreased after reaction
with cysteamine, which was consistent with the membranes possessing
larger pores (Figure 6b). Figure 6b and Figures 4 show that as the
molar equivalents of disulfide in the membrane increased, the selectivity
between pNB and TPM decreased because more disulfide bonds were broken.
Membrane C-2 showed minimal changes because cysteamine does not react
with this membrane, and membrane B-2 showed significant loss of selectivity
(86%), and the flux of pNB was close to that of the solid support
in the absence of an epoxy membrane (Table S10). This result was expected because membrane B-2 dissolved after
treatment with cysteamine. For the membrane series of B1C3-2, B1C1-2, and B3C1-2, the membranes lost 29, 58, and 75% respectively of their
initial selectivity (Figure 6b), which correlated with the molar equivalents of disulfide
bonds cleaved in each membrane. Repeated experiments to reform the
disulfide bond after reaction with cysteamine did not succeed, and
selectivities of the original membranes could not be completely recovered
after reaction with cysteamine.36−39

2.4 Separation of Chemicals in a Three-Component
Mixture
Cleavage of the disulfide bonds yielded membranes
with different selectivities, which would allow for a simple separation
of a three-component mixture of chemicals A, B, and C (Figure 7a). The first separation would
remove the smallest chemical, A, from two larger chemicals, B and
C, that were retained by the membrane (Figure 7b). Next, the cross-links in the membrane
could be cleaved to increase the pore size and change the separation
properties (Figure 7c). This change in separation properties of the membrane would allow
B to permeate the membrane while retaining C (Figure 7d). The result would be the separation of
three chemicals using a single membrane.

Figure 7 Depiction of a three-component
separation. The yellow membrane
indicates a membrane that has not been treated with a chemical stimulus,
and a white membrane indicates that the membrane has been treated
with a chemical stimulus. (a) Initially, at t = 0,
a mixture of three chemicals on the retention side of the membrane
is shown. (b) Over time, the red molecule has permeated the membrane
and is extracted from the permeate side of the membrane. (c) Membrane
has been treated with a chemical stimulus to change the membrane selectivity
and fresh solvent is added to the permeate side. (d) After some amount
of time, the green molecule permeates the membrane, and the blue molecule
is retained by the membrane.

A three-component mixture of equal molar equivalents of m-dinitrobenzene, TPM, and 1,3,5-tris(diphenylamino)benzene
(TDAB) was added to a separation apparatus using membrane B1C1-2. m-Dinitrobenzene is the smallest
chemical with a molecular weight of 168.11 g mol–1, and TPM and TDAB have molecular weights of 244.34 and 579.79 g
mol–1, respectively. The first fraction of permeate
was collected before treating the membrane with cysteamine, and it
was found to be highly enriched with m-dinitrobenzene
(Table 2). The permeate
contained 84% of the initial starting mass of m-dinitrobenzene,
and the purity was increased from 33.3 to 82%.

After collection
of the first permeate, the remaining mixture was
removed from the separation apparatus and the membrane was treated
with cysteamine to cleave the cross-links. After the cross-links were
cleaved, the retentate was reintroduced to the separation apparatus,
solvent was added to the permeate side of the membrane, and another
permeate fraction was collected. The second permeate fraction was
enriched in TPM, containing 49% of the initial starting material at
67% purity. The retentate was collected after isolation of the second
permeate, and it was significantly enriched in TDAB. The final retentate
contained 88% of the starting TDAB chemical at 71% purity. The epoxy
membrane was able to separate the three chemicals into three different
fractions, all significantly enriched in purity compared with purity
levels in the starting mixture.

3 Conclusions
We report the first examples of epoxy nanofiltration membranes
that have cleavable disulfide bonds within the polymer matrix. These
disulfide bonds reacted with the chemical stimulus cysteamine, modifying
the flux and selectivity of chemicals through the membrane. Cleaving
the disulfide bonds increased the pore sizes, increased the flux,
and decreased the selectivities of the membranes. Furthermore, incorporating
the disulfide bond in a membrane gave a single epoxy membrane with
two different separation properties. These membranes were successfully
applied to the separation of a three-component mixture. Though membrane
modification is currently not reversible, in further research we hope
to address this issue.

Not only is this new methodology useful
in tackling chemical separations,
but we believe that the introduction of labile disulfide bonds within
a membrane may be useful in extending the lifetime of OSN membranes,
which are typically 1–3 years.40

Over time, membranes age and undergo compaction, and a significant
decrease in flux of chemicals and solvents through the membrane is
often observed. If the membrane begins to suffer from compaction,
cleaving a disulfide bond in the membrane could restore the flux and
allow for a full recovery of membrane properties. When the membrane
has aged further, cleaving more disulfide bonds could allow for the
recovery of flux again, further extending the life of the membrane.
Such an innovation may improve membrane performance and efficiency
and spur further enthusiasm for this attractive green separation technology.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All
chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, or VWR at their highest purity and used
as received. Flat-sheet membrane PZ polyacrylonitrile solid supports
(MWCO 30 000) were purchased from Synder Filtration and used
as received. 1,4-Butanediol diglycidyl ether was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and purified as described in a prior publication.31

4.2 Characterization
1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected using a Bruker DPX-500
at 500 MHz or Bruker DRX-400 at 400 MHz at room temperature. NMR samples
were referenced to trimethylsilane. Fourier transform-infrared spectra
were collected at room temperature using an Avatar 370 FT-IR with
a HP-DTGS-KBr detector. A Hitachi S-4800N scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) system was used to collect SEM micrographs. Raman spectra were
collected using a custom Raman instrument. The components include
a diode-pumped CW laser (Excelsior, Spectra physics) producing 300
mW of 532 nm radiation, a Horiba iHR320 spectrometer, and an Andor
Newton BV-CCD detector.

4.3 Fabrication of Membrane
B-2
Diamine
monomer B (4-aminophenyldisulfide, 0.25 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved
in dimethylformamide (0.32 mL) in a scintillation vial. Purified diepoxide
monomer 2 (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether, 0.37 mL, 2 mmol) was added
to the reaction mixture, and the vial was placed in an oil bath at
60 °C for 12 h. The vial was then removed, and 0.05 mL of the
reaction mixture was cast onto a polyacrylonitrile solid support.
The membrane was placed in an oven at 60 °C and allowed to cure
for 7 d.

Fabrication of membranes C-2, B1C3-2, B1C1-2, and B3C1-2
followed a similar procedure, and experimental details are described
in the Supporting Information.

4.4 Flux of pNB, Triethylamine, and Tripropylamine
A membrane
was clamped between two O-rings and two glass vessels.
pNB (0.20 g, 1.3 mmol), triethylamine (0.18 mL, 1.3 mmol), tripropylamine
(0.25 mL, 1.3 mmol), and DCM (25 mL) were added to one side of the
membrane (retentate). DCM (25 mL) was added to the other side of the
membrane (permeate). Approximately 7.07 cm2 of membrane
was in contact with solvent on both sides. Solvent on both sides of
the membrane was continuously stirred at room temperature. Samples
(1 mL) were removed from the permeate and retentate sides of the membrane
at various time points. p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate
(1 mL of a 0.53 M solution) dissolved in methanol was added to each
sample that was removed from the separation apparatus to form salts
with the amines. This increased their boiling points so the volatile
amines would not evaporate. Tetraethylene glycol dissolved in DCM
(0.4 mL of 0.023 M solution) was added to each sample, and solvent
was removed by evaporation. The samples were analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy to find concentrations of the chemicals on both
sides of the membrane.

This experiment was repeated using pNB
and TPM.

4.5 Flux of pNB, Triethylamine, and Tripropylamine
after Treating the Membrane with Cysteamine
A membrane was
clamped between two O-rings and two glass vessels. DCM (8 mL), MeOH
(7 mL), and cysteamine (1.0 g, 13.0 mmol) were added to the side of
the apparatus facing the membrane (retentate). DCM (8 mL) and MeOH
(7 mL) were added to the other side of the membrane (permeate). After
18 h, both solutions were removed and both sides of the apparatus
were washed with 50 mL of MeOH and 50 mL of DCM. After washing, chemicals
were added to the retentate side, and the experiment followed the
same procedure as described previously.

between two O-rings in a glass separation apparatus. m-Dinitrobenzene (22.8 mg, 0.14 mmol), TPM (33.0 mg, 0.14 mmol), and
TDAB (80.5 mg, 0.14 mmol) were dissolved in DCM (10 mL) and added
to one side of the membrane (retentate). DCM (70 mL) was added to
the other side of the membrane (permeate). Extractions were performed
every 24 h by decanting the permeate and removing the solvent in vacuo.
Fresh DCM (70 mL) was added to the permeate side of the membrane.
Permeate samples were weighed and analyzed via 1H NMR spectroscopy.
After 7 d, the retentate was removed, analyzed by 1H NMR
spectroscopy to determine its composition, and saved. The membrane
was then treated with cysteamine as described above. After treatment
with cysteamine, the saved retention fraction was redissolved in DCM
(10 mL) and returned to the retentate side of the membrane. DCM (70
mL) was added to the downstream. Extractions were performed again
every 24 h. After 13 d, the retentate was decanted and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine composition of the retention.

4.7 Monitoring the Polymerization via FT-IR Spectroscopy
Monomers used to fabricate an epoxy membrane were mixed together
as described above. A couple of drops were removed from the mixture
and placed between two polished NaCl salt plates. The first FT-IR
spectrum was collected immediately. After collecting the first spectrum,
the salt plates were placed in a 60 °C oven. Subsequent spectra
were collected at different time points by removing the salt plates
from the oven, collecting a spectrum, and placing the salt plates
back in the 60 °C oven. The reaction was monitored until there
were no further changes in the spectra, indicating that the reaction
had reached completion and the membranes were ready for use.

4.8 Collecting Raman Spectra of the Membranes
Epoxy membranes
were fabricated as described above and in the Supporting Information. Before acquiring Raman
spectra, the spectrometer and camera were calibrated using known emission
lines from a neon lamp. The laser radiation incident on the samples
was focused to spot size of ca. 100 μm2, and the
beam energy was attenuated to achieve irradiance on the samples between
7 and 0.5 mW to avoid sample damage. The scattered radiation from
the sample was collected via a Nikon f/1.2 camera lens with a focal
length of 50 mm and passed through two holographic notch filters (Kaiser
optical systems) to eliminate 532 nm radiation. The collected radiation
was focused onto a 0.05 mm slit before entering the spectrometer.
Spectra are composed of 50 accumulations with exposure times of 2
s per accumulation (100 s total acquisition time). Spectra were collected
for membranes C-2, B1C3-2, B1C1-2, B3C1-2, and B-2 before exposure
to cysteamine and after 3 h of exposure to cysteamine.
