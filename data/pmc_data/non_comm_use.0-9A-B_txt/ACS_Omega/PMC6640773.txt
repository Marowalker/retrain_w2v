Pirin is an iron (Fe)-dependent regulatory
protein of nuclear factor
κB (NF-κB) transcription factors. Binding studies have
suggested that the oxidative state of iron plays a crucial role in
modulating the binding of Pirin to NF-κB p65, in turn enhancing
the binding of p65 to DNA. The Fe(III) form of Pirin is the active
form and binds to NF-κB, whereas the Fe(II) form does not bind
to NF-κB. However, the surprising consequence of a single charge
perturbation in the functional modulation of NF-κB is not well
understood. Here, we use quantum mechanical calculations and microsecond-long
molecular dynamics simulations to explore the free-energy landscapes
of the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms of Pirin. We show that the restricted
conformational space and electrostatic complementarity of the Fe(III)
form of Pirin are crucial for binding and regulation of NF-κB.
Our results suggest that a subtle single-electron redox trigger could
significantly modulate the conformational dynamics and electrostatics
of proteins in subcellular allosteric regulatory processes.

Introduction
Nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB) is a class of ubiquitous
cellular regulatory transcription factors that modulate the intracellular
signaling cascade for immune response, inflammatory response, cell
growth, and apoptosis.1−5 Their uncontrolled regulation could lead to several life-threatening
diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.6−8 In response to activating external stimuli, NF-κB
proteins are translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where
they bind and activate several κB genes. Inside the nucleus,
the activity of NF-κB proteins is tightly controlled by a number
of regulatory proteins and cofactors, collectively known as co-regulators.9−11 Although the exact role of these co-regulators is not well understood,
experiments suggest that one such co-regulator, Pirin, interestingly
plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of NF-κB proteins
via a single-electron redox process at the iron center.

Pirin
is a nonheme iron-binding nuclear protein composed of 290
amino acid residues.12,13 The iron is located in an open
cleft near an R-shaped loop (Figure 1).14 A recent study has
suggested that Pirin binds and activates NF-κB in a redox-dependent
manner, although the mechanism of the redox reaction is not completely
known.14 It has been suggested that the
Fe(III) form of Pirin is the active form and the Fe(II) form of Pirin
is the resting form. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation,
surface plasmon resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy have shown
that Pirin in its Fe(III) form significantly enhances the binding
of the NF-κB p65 homodimer to the κB DNA.14 High-resolution crystal structures of the Fe(II) form (PDB
ID: 1J1L) and
Fe(III) form (PDB ID: 4GUL) of Pirin show that the metal is located near the
R-shaped loop region and is coordinated to three histidines (His56,
His58, His101), one glutamate (Glu103), and two water molecules. The
crystal structures of Pirin in the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms show subtle
differences in the conformations at the R-shaped Fe center, but these
differences are significant enough at the R-shaped region that is
suggested to directly interact with the outer surface of the NF-κB
p65 protein.14 Although the X-ray structures
show subtle differences between the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms of Pirin,
the effect of Pirin binding to NF-κB is dramatic, and Pirin
significantly enhances the binding of NF-κB to the κB
DNA. Additionally, very little is known about the effect of a single-electron
redox process on the conformational dynamics of Pirin and on the regulation
of NF-κB.

represents the R-shaped loop. A zoomed-in image of the Fe-binding
site, with an octahedral geometry and coordinating residues, is presented.

Results and Discussion
Conformational Dynamics
of the Fe(II) and Fe(III) Forms of Pirin
We initially study
the conformational dynamics of the Fe(II) and
Fe(III) forms of Pirin using principal component analysis (PCA) on
the Cartesian coordinates of the backbone Cα atoms to determine
the principal eigenvectors that represent the dominant motions (Figure 2A).

Figure 2 PCA of the Fe(II) and
Fe(III) forms of Pirin. (A) Projection of
principal component 1 (PC1) and PC2 of Fe(II) (black) and Fe(III)
(red). PC1 contributes 62% and PC2 contributes 18% among the top five
components. (B) Dominant motions contributed by PC1: Fe(III), green;
Fe(II), yellow. (C) Major fluctuations contributed by PC2: Fe(III),
green; Fe(II), yellow. Fe and waters are shown as pink and red spheres,
respectively. Movies of PC1 and PC2 fluctuations are provided in the Supporting
Information.

The majority of the total
fluctuations of the two forms is captured
by the top two PCs: PC1 and PC2. PC1 clearly separates the Fe(II)
and Fe(III) forms of Pirin, with little overlap between the two forms
(Figure 2A). The ensemble
of conformations of the Fe(III) form of Pirin is restricted to a single
energy basin. On the other hand, the ensemble of the Fe(II) form of
Pirin is relatively broader than that of the Fe(III) form, sampling
multiple basins. Therefore, the results suggest that binding of the
Fe(III) form of Pirin to NF-κB would be entropically more favorable
than that of the Fe(II) form, losing less conformational entropy upon
binding. The dominant motions contributed by PC1 are primarily observed
near the R-shaped loop region (residues Ala74–Gly83), residues
Pro249–Phe256, the C-terminus, and the terminal helix of Pirin
(Figure 2B). The major
contributions from PC2 were also observed in the R-shaped loop region,
mainly residues Ala74–Gly83. The R-shaped region has been suggested
to be the binding interface of Pirin when interacting with NF-κB
p65, using mutagenesis experiments.14

The probability densities of the distributions of the conformations
projected on PC1 and PC2 were calculated to identify the prevalent
conformations of Pirin in the different oxidation states of iron (Figure 3). In the Fe(II)
form of Pirin, two dominant conformational states were observed (Figure 3A). The Fe(III) form
of Pirin is localized to a single free-energy basin (Figure 3B), as shown in Figure 2. The conformations at the
center of the free-energy basins were isolated, and the electrostatic
potentials for each conformation were calculated using the Adaptive
Poisson–Boltzmann Solver (APBS)15 and projected onto their respective molecular surfaces. The electrostatic
potential shows that in the Fe(II) form of Pirin the R-shaped loop
region is a patchwork of electropositive and electronegative regions.
On the other hand, the electrostatic potential of the Fe(III) form
shows a significant concentration of electropositive regions on the
proposed binding surface of Pirin. Most interestingly, the distribution
of the electropositive environment was observed in the R-shaped loop
region and its surroundings. These results clearly show that a single-electron
redox process in the metal center can significantly modulate the conformational
dynamics and electrostatics of proteins. We hypothesized that electrostatic
modulation by the Fe(III) of Pirin could provide a better electrostatic
complementarity with NF-κB p65.

0.5 kT (blue).

Role of Electrostatics
in the Pirin–NF-κB Association
To test the electrostatic
complementarity hypothesis, we calculated
the electrostatic potential of the NF-κB p65 protein obtained
from the Protein Data Bank, with PDB ID 2RAM.16Figure 3C shows the electrostatic
potentials on the molecular surface of the NF-κB p65 monomer
bound to DNA. As expected, the DNA-binding region of NF-κB has
a high density of electropositive potential. On the other hand, the
region suggested to interact with Pirin has a high density of electronegative
potential (Figure 3D), suggesting electrostatic complementarity with the binding surface
of Pirin. Unlike the Fe(II) form, the Fe(III) form of Pirin provides
the positive environment necessary to complement the negative potential
of the interaction site on NF-κB p65.

Estimating the electrostatic
interaction free energy between Pirin and the NF-κB–DNA
complex further assessed the contribution of electrostatics. The initial
coordinates of the NF-κB–DNA complex were obtained from
the Protein Data Bank, with PBD ID 2RAM. The initial Pirin–NF-κB–DNA
supercomplex was obtained by docking the Pirin onto the NF-κB–DNA
complex using ZDOCK,17 applying constraints
based on mutagenesis results, as previously described.14 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were then
performed on the Pirin–NF-κB–DNA supercomplexes
of the Fe(III) form of Pirin. More details of the simulations can
be found in the Computational Methods section.
The molecular mechanics (MM)/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area
approach was used to estimate the electrostatic contribution to the
binding free energy (ΔGbinding)
of Pirin within the supercomplex. The binding free energies were calculated
using snapshots from the MD trajectories. Using the snapshots of the
Fe(III) form of the Pirin supercomplex, the partial charges of the
iron center and surrounding residues were replaced with the partial
charges corresponding to the system in the Fe(II) state, and the binding
free energies were recomputed. This was done to assess the immediate
effect of changing from Fe(III) to Fe(II) on the binding free energy
before any conformal change. The electrostatics component of the binding
free energy for the binding of the Fe(III) form of Pirin to the supercomplex
has a much lower value (ΔGbinding(electrostatic)), −444.5 ± 2.4 kcal/mol, compared to
the ΔGbinding(electrostatic) for
the Fe(II) form, −216.6 ± 2.2 kcal/mol, corresponding
to a significant reduction. These results also suggest a significant
role for electrostatics in the association between Pirin and NF-κB.
It can be concluded that the Fe(III) form of Pirin has a stronger
affinity to the NF-κB–DNA complex also due to the more
favorable electrostatic interaction free energy. Taken together, the
results suggest that the Fe(III) form of Pirin is entropically preorganized
to bind with better electrostatic free energy, losing less entropy
upon binding compared with Fe(II). The Fe(III) form of Pirin could
therefore bind more tightly to the NF-κB–DNA complex
compared with the Fe(II) form, in agreement with the spectroscopic
assays.14

Reorganization of Residue–Residue
Contact Dynamics
It is clear from the current studies that
a single-electron redox
process can significantly alter the dynamics and electrostatics of
Pirin. How does this subtle redox process dramatically alter the dynamics?
We can answer this question by investigating the ensuing rearrangements
of the residue–residue contact dynamics and how this information
is propagated away from the iron center. In general, proteins with N number of residues can have N(N – 1)/2 possible residue–residue contacts.
The majority of these
residue–residue contacts are never formed, and a small amount
of contacts are always formed or dynamically form and break in the
ensemble of native conformations. Analysis of residue–residue
contacts between the active and inactive forms of protein structures
from the Protein Data Bank suggested that the network of residue–residue
contacts can describe functional modulation of proteins.18

In this study, we define a residue–residue
contact as having been formed when any two of the inter-residue heavy
atoms are within 4.5 Å. Only non-neighboring residue–residue
contacts are considered. A contact is defined as a part of the “dynamic
contacts” if the average percentage of contact formation is
between 10 and 90% over the entire microsecond-long simulations of
the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms of Pirin. A total of 594 dynamic contacts
were considered. Details of the method have been described previously.19,20 Perturbation of the contact dynamics between the Fe(II) and Fe(III)
forms of Pirin is analyzed by carrying out PCA on the contact trajectories
of the dynamic contacts. A contact trajectory is a time-dependent
trajectory of all of the dynamic contacts defined as 0 or 1 to signify
broken or formed, respectively. Projections of the top two PCs are
shown in Figure 4A.
The projection in the residue–residue contact space explored
by the Fe(II) form of Pirin shows an extended distribution of loosely
forming and breaking contacts relative to the Fe(III) form.

Figure 4 Residue–residue
contact dynamics of the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms
of Pirin. Projection of the top two PCs of dynamic contacts in the
residue–residue contact space for Fe(II) (black) and Fe(III)
(red). PC1 contributes 54.5% and PC2 contributes 25.7% among the top
five components (A). The residue–residue contacts that are
more formed and more broken in the Fe(III) form are represented in
blue and red, respectively. The width of the cylinder represents the
magnitude of the difference. Residue–residue contacts, with
an absolute difference greater than 30% (B) of all of the dynamics
contacts, are shown. Iron and waters are shown as green and red van
der Waals spheres, respectively.

On the other hand, a more restricted residue–residue
contact
space is seen in the Fe(III) form of Pirin, which is completely shifted
away from that of the Fe(II) form, suggesting tighter residue–residue
contacts. The separation between the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms of Pirin
is along the PC1 component. We take a closer look at those dynamic
contacts that largely contribute to PC1. The percent difference in
dynamic contact is calculated by subtracting the fraction of formed
contact in the Fe(II) form of Pirin from that for the Fe(III) form,
that is, (Fe(III) – Fe(II)); therefore, contacts that are more
formed in Fe(III) are positive (shown in blue) and contacts that are
less formed in the Fe(III) form are negative (shown in red). The difference
in the fractions between the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms of Pirin is
shown in Figure 4B. Figure 4B shows the residue–residue
contact statistics when the difference is more than 30%. Figure 4B clearly shows significant
residue–residue contact rearrangement around the R-shaped region,
the loop region, and the N-terminal region of Pirin, mainly the proposed
interaction site with NF-κB p65. More precisely, more number
of contacts are formed at the R-shaped region as the oxidative state
of iron changes from Fe(II) to Fe(III). The residue–residue
interactions tighten up in the Fe(III) form, restricting the conformational
space. Interestingly, rearrangement of the residue–residue
contacts due to the subtle redox trigger is shown to propagate far
beyond the iron center, accompanied by changes in the backbone dynamics.
These results therefore suggest that such a subtle change in the oxidation
state of metal ions could significantly alter the dynamics of proteins
distal to the metal center.

Conclusions
We
have investigated a plausible role of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox-dependent
activation of Pirin in the regulation of NF-κB transcription
factors. In the Fe(III) form, Pirin explores a more restricted conformational
space compared to that in the Fe(II) form, which explores multiple
conformational states, suggesting a possible role of entropy in the
Pirin–NF-κB association. Preorganization of the Fe(III)
form of Pirin would be entropically more favorable upon binding to
the NF-κB protein due to the less loss in entropy compared to
that for the Fe(II) form of Pirin. In addition to the entropic contribution,
the charge distribution associated with the Fe(III) form induces a
more electropositive environment at the R-shaped region, creating
an electrostatic complementary surface for its binding partner, NF-κB
p65. The electrostatic contribution of the binding free energy between
the Fe(III) form of Pirin and NF-κB p65 is found to be significantly
more favorable than that for the Fe(II) form. This study provides
substantive evidence for the pivotal role of entropy and electrostatics
in iron redox-dependent activation of Pirin in NF-κB regulation.
These results provide a new outlook and perspective on redox activation
of metalloproteins in complex biological systems. A single redox trigger
could allosterically regulate subcellular processes. We can therefore
speculate that many other cellular processes are possibly regulated
by subtle changes in the oxidative state of metal centers, cofactors,
or amino acid residues.

Computational Methods
Here, we have
used quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)
methods to calculate partial charges and microsecond-long MD simulations
(a total 5 μs) of the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms of Pirin to explore
the free-energy landscape and provide a detailed atomistic description
of the dynamical response as a result of the redox process.

Calculation
of the Partial Charge of Iron-Coordinating Residues
The initial
structure of the iron (Fe)-bound Pirin (obtained from
PDB ID: 1J1L(13)) was processed using the xleap module
in AmberTools12. Two systems, one for Fe(II) and one for Fe(III),
were solvated in octahedron periodic boxes using the TIP3P21 explicit water model. The overall charge of
the system was neutralized by adding counter ions for electrostatic
neutrality. The Fe(II)- and Fe(III)-bound forms of Pirin were optimized
using the QM/MM method incorporated in the AMBER14 package22 and using the external Gaussian0323 program for the quantum mechanical calculations.
The QM region consisted of His56, His58, His101, Glu103, Gln115, two
water molecules, and the Fe atom (Figure S1A,B). The histidine residues coordinated to the Fe atom are treated
as monoprotonated HID residues. The QM/MM minimization was performed
with the QM region treated at the B3LYP level of theory and the LANL2DZ
Hay–Wadt effective core potential as the basis set. The rest
of the protein was treated with the AMBER14 ff14sb force-field parameters.24−27 On the basis of previous experiments, the spin states of Fe(III)
and Fe(II) were considered as high spin and low spin, respectively.14 In addition to the minimized geometries in the
QM/MM region, two additional residues, Pro57 (connecting His56 and
His58) and Ala102 (connecting His101 and Glu103), were considered
in calculating the electrostatic potential, preceding the restrained
electrostatic potential (RESP)28 charge-fitting
procedure (Figure S1C). Only subtle structural
changes in the iron centers and to the distal regions were observed
after the QM/MM minimization (see Figure S2). The RESP partial charges were calculated for ∼150 atoms
from the electrostatic potential calculated at the M06 level of theory
and all-electron 6-31G(d) basis set.29 The
partial charges obtained from the RESP fitting procedure (see Table S1 for detail) were used for the microsecond-long
MD simulations.

MD Simulations
All MD simulations
were performed with
the CUDA version of the AMBER1422 program,
using the ff14SB30 force field. Each simulation
was run using a single NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 GPU. The overall charge
of the system was neutralized by adding counter ions for electrostatic
neutrality. The SHAKE algorithm31 was implemented
to constrain all of the bonds involving hydrogen. The systems were
equilibrated at 300 K, and the Langevin thermostat, with a collision
frequency of 1 ps–1, was used to maintain the temperature.32 The long-range electrostatic interactions were
calculated using the particle mesh Ewald summation method,33 and a cutoff of 9 Å was used for the nonbonded
interactions. All simulations were carried out using the NPT ensemble
at a constant pressure of 1 bar, and a time step of 2 fs was used
to integrate the equation of motion. The optimized nonbonded parameters
for Fe(II) and Fe(III) by Merz et al. were used.34,35 After a series of minimizations (500 step conjugate gradient method
followed by 500 step steepest descent method) and MD simulations with
constraints on the protein (slowly releasing the force constant from
250 to 10 kcal/mol/Å2), the production simulations
were run for 2.5 μs, considering the first 500 ns of simulation
as equilibration. The crystallographic coordination bonds from the
Fe to the coordinating atoms were maintained by applying harmonic
bonds with a force constant of 150.0 kcal/mol Å2 throughout
the simulation. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) over the trajectory
indicates equilibration of the trajectory. The RMSDs of the Cα
atoms of both systems suggested that each system had reached equilibrium
(Figure S3) and therefore all of the analyses
were performed during the last 2 μs of the simulations. VMD36 and PyMOL37 visualization
programs were used for graphical representations.

Calculation
of Electrostatic Potentials
The electrostatic
potentials of Pirin and NF-κB were determined using numerical
solutions to the Poisson–Boltzmann equation using the APBS
package.15 Atomic charges were obtained
from the AMBER force field and parameterized partial charges for the
iron center. A low dielectric constant of 2.0 was assigned to the
protein interior, whereas a dielectric of 78.0 was assigned to the
solvent. Multigrid solutions with grid dimensions of 161 × 131
× 161 and 161 × 225 × 161, with a solvent radius of
1.4 Å, were used for Pirin and NF-κB, respectively. The
salt concentration of 150 mM was used as the ionic strength for the
calculations. The temperature was set to 310 K.
