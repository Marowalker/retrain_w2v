Synthetic
routes to potent bicyclic nonsteroidal sulfamate-based
active-site-directed inhibitors of the enzyme steroid sulfatase (STS),
an emerging target in the treatment of postmenopausal hormone-dependent
diseases, including breast cancer, are described. Sulfamate analogs 9–27 and 28–46 of the core in vivo active two-ring coumarin template,
modified at the 4- and 3-positions, respectively, were synthesized
to expand structure–activity relationships. α-Alkylacetoacetates
were used to synthesize coumarin sulfamate derivatives with 3-position
modifications, and the bicyclic ring of other parent coumarins was
primarily constructed via the Pechmann synthesis of hydroxyl coumarins.
Compounds were examined for STS inhibition in intact MCF-7 breast
cancer cells and in placental microsomes. Low nanomolar potency STS
inhibitors were achieved, and some were found to inhibit the enzyme
in MCF-7 cells ca. 100–500 more potently than the parent 4-methylcoumarin-7-O-sulfamate 3, with the best compounds close
in potency to the tricyclic clinical drug Irosustat. 3-Hexyl-4-methylcoumarin-7-O-sulfamate 29 and 3-benzyl-4-methylcoumarin-7-O-sulfamate 41 were particularly effective
inhibitors with IC50 values of 0.68 and 1 nM in intact
MCF-7 cells and 8 and 32 nM for placental microsomal STS, respectively.
They were docked into the STS active site for comparison with estrone
3-O-sulfamate and Irosustat, showing their sulfamate
group close to the catalytic hydrated formylglycine residue and their
pendant group lying between the hydrophobic sidechains of L103, F178,
and F488. Such highly potent STS inhibitors expand the structure–activity
relationship for these coumarin sulfamate-based agents that possess
therapeutic potential and may be worthy of further development.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a major health threat
to women of all age groups
and a prime contributor to cancer deaths in women. About two-thirds
of cases when first diagnosed are classified as hormone-dependent
(ER+), in which to grow and develop the tumors need estrogens,
which act via the estrogen receptor (ER).1 Endocrine therapy administered by the oral route is an effective
form of treatment for this type of cancer.2 Although newer targeted agents such as mTOR and CDK4/6 inhibitors,
e.g., everolimus and palbociclib, are now gaining recognition in treatment,
they are expensive and are administered in conjunction with endocrine
therapy.3,4 Currently, the first-line treatment for
patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer (HDBC) includes either
a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, such as tamoxifen, which
blocks the action of estrogens at the ER or an ER downregulator (SERD),5 or a “third-generation” aromatase
inhibitor (AI) such as letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane. This
strategy leads to a reduction in the biosynthesis of estrogens and
has been found to be superior to tamoxifen alone.6 Also, in one study, anastrozole has shown significant preventative
activity in high-risk postmenopausal women with undiagnosed breast
cancer.7 However, resistance will inevitably
occur and blocking the action of estrogens at the ER and inhibiting
the aromatase enzyme are not the only strategies available for endocrine
therapy. There is now evidence that inhibition of steroid sulfatase
(STS),8 the enzyme that converts the biologically
inactive estrone sulfate to estrone, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate to dehydroepiandrosterone, may render significant estrogen
deprivation in patients treated with an STS inhibitor. This strategy
works in an intracrine fashion because in the postmenopausal setting
tumor cells can convert the large reservoir of circulating estrone
sulfates, imported through organic anion transporters, to active estrogen
in situ. Moreover, STS inhibition also decreases levels of androstenediol,
an estrogenic androgen,9 levels of which
are unaffected by AI inhbition. Chronic AI treatment leads to compensatory
increases in both STS and 17β-HSD1 levels.10 Moreover, the contribution of both STS and organic anion
transporters to AI resistance was recently established and could be
overcome by an STS inhibitor.11 These ideas
have led to STS inhibitors reaching phase II clinical trials for several
indications in oncology including breast cancer and endometrial cancer
and a phase I trial in prostate cancer.12

The first STS inhibitor discovered with a remarkable potency
was
the steroidal sulfamate ester estrone-3-O-sulfamate
(EMATE, 1, Figure 1).13 This agent is orally active
and inhibits STS in an irreversible manner. However, EMATE was subsequently
shown to be highly estrogenic in rats and this undesirable property
effectively precluded its further development for use in the treatment
of HDBC, although the estradiol variant (E2MATE, PGL2001, 1a) has nevertheless proceeded to clinical trials in the hormone-dependent
nononcology setting of endometriosis.12a,12b,14

Figure 1 Structures of STS inhibitors: 1 (EMATE), 1a (E2MATE), and 2 (Irosustat, STX64, 667COUMATE,
BN83495).

In an attempt to search for a
nonestrogenic alternative to 1 with a comparable or even
superior STS inhibitory profile,
many structurally diverse inhibitors that contain the pharmacophore
for irreversible inhibition of STS, i.e., an aryl sulfamate ester,
have been developed,8,12,15 leading to the clinical inhibitor Irosustat 2 (Figure 1).16 Initial work focused on designing A/B ring mimics of 1 such as derivatives of indanone, tetralone, and tetrahydronaphthol,15 and this yielded a series of bicyclic coumarin
sulfamates17 (3–8, Figure 2) that were promising leads, showed a significant improvement over
the first lead nonsteroidal candidate 5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalene
7-O-sulfamate, and, more significantly, possessed
in vivo activity. A main lead was the two-ring 4-methylcoumarin-7-O-sulfamate (3) that was orally active in vivo
and, like EMATE, was a highly potent time- and concentration-dependent
STS inhibitor, but importantly with no rodent estrogenic activity.18,19 The related 3,4-dimethylcoumarin-7-O-sulfamate
(6) inhibited STS in MCF-7 cells with IC50 = 30 nM, and a series of derived tricyclic compounds was subsequently
synthesized that proved even more potent.16,17 Further development of this series of nonsteroidal inhibitors led
to the discovery of the tricyclic coumarin sulfamate (2) (Irosustat, STX64, 667COUMATE, BN83495, Figure 1) which has proven to be the most successful
STS inhibitor to date.12,16 Recently, other examples of both
mono-20,21 and two-ring sulfamate-based STS inhibitors22 have been published, but these compounds are
generally still of relatively modest inhibitory activity. Irosustat
was the first STS inhibitor to enter clinical trials for postmenopausal
patients with advanced HDBC and has shown encouraging results.12,23−26 Irosustat has just completed CRUK sponsored phase II trials in both
early breast cancer and in advanced breast cancer in combination with
an AI, with positive indications of efficacy.27,28

However, despite the significant
progress made in developing irreversible
inhibitors of STS and although 1a and 2 have
reached clinical trials, their mechanism of action remains unresolved.
The crystal structure of human STS has been solved,29,30 and several hypotheses have been postulated to suggest how a sulfamate-based
STS inhibitor might inhibit STS irreversibly. The currently favored
hypothesis is a transfer of the sulfamoyl group (or as sulfonylamine)
to a hydrated or unhydrated STS active site formylglycine residue,
and this leads to inactivation of the active site machinery.12b Although multiple mechanisms have been proposed
for this, e.g. ref. (12e), see ref. (12b) for
a full up-to-date discussion.

Because of the unique role that
a coumarin ring system plays in
the design of potent STS inhibitors, we further expand here the bicyclic
coumarin sulfamate series exemplified by 3–8 to give derivatives that bear various substituents at the
3- and/or 4-position(s), following on from preliminary encouraging
data.17 The inhibitory activities of most
new candidates against STS were evaluated in MCF-7 cells and in placental
microsomes. This study, in conjunction with other studies carried
out on 2,16,17 provides a more comprehensive
structure–activity relationship (SAR) for coumarin sulfamates
and has also produced highly active inhibitors of picomolar potency
in vitro. The activity of two of the best bicyclic compounds is supported
by molecular modeling and by comparing binding poses with those of
the benchmark compounds EMATE and Irosustat.

Chemistry
The
compounds synthesized in this work fall into two different
series: (i) those with an alkyl group of increasing carbon chain length
or other functionalities at the C-4 position of the coumarin ring
(A, Figure 3) and (ii) those with an alkyl group of increasing carbon chain length
or other functionalities at the C-3 position and with a methyl group
at the C-4 position of the coumarin ring (B, Figure 3).

Figure 3 General structures of
bicyclic coumarin sulfamates: A: 4-substituted series, B: 3,4-disubstituted series.

We employed β-keto esters as starting materials for
synthesizing
coumarins with a substituent at the 3-position, and this also leads
to a 4-methyl substituent. Because 4-methylcoumarin 7-O-sulfamate (COUMATE) is more active as an STS inhibitor than unsubstituted
coumarin 7-O-sulfamate, we retained this 4-substituted
group, which imbues good activity.18,19 Thus, to study
further the SAR of COUMATE, we ideally needed to keep this 4-methyl
group for comparison while we explored different substituents at the
3-position. Apart from coumarin 46a, the bicyclic ring
of other parent coumarins was constructed by the Pechmann synthesis
of hydroxyl coumarins. For our purposes, this route was preferred
because the target structures can be prepared with relative ease by
condensing resorcinol with an appropriate β-keto ester. The
only synthetic hurdle to overcome is the synthesis of the various
β-keto esters required because most of them are not available
commercially. The 7-hydroxycoumarins synthesized are subsequently
sulfamoylated with freshly prepared sulfamoyl chloride to form the
corresponding coumarin sulfamates.

The alkanoyl acetate esters
required as starting material for the
coumarins in the 4-alkyl series (A, Figure 3) were synthesized by treating
the inexpensive ethyl potassium malonate with the corresponding acid
chloride in the presence of magnesium chloride (MgCl2),
triethylamine (Et3N), and acetonitrile (CH3CN)
as the solvent (Scheme 1).31 This method has the advantage of
being relatively safe, clean, economical, and suitable for scaling
up with the product produced in high yield and purity, which is free
from any unnecessary side products. Rathke and Cowan32 have shown that the combination of anhydrous MgCl2 and Et3N provides a system with enough basicity for metallating
ethyl potassium malonate and that the reactions failed when MgCl2 was replaced with other metal chlorides such as ZnCl2, CuCl2, FeCl3, TiCl4, LiCl,
and AlCl3.32 The number of equivalents
of reagents used in the reaction determines the yield of the product
obtained. For aromatic acid chlorides which have electron-withdrawing
substituents such as fluoro, chloro, or nitro groups, 2.1 equiv of
potassium ethyl malonate, 2.5 equiv of MgCl2, and 2.2 equiv
of Et3N are optimal, and the yield is around 90%. On the
other hand, aliphatic acid chlorides or aromatic acid chlorides containing
electron-donating substituents generate side products, which are minimized
by employing extra equivalent of Et3N to obtain the alkanoyl
acetate in high yield.

temperature (rt), 12 h; (iii) RCHO, SnCl2, CH2Cl2, rt, 3 h.

β-Ketoesters
were also prepared efficiently by reacting the
corresponding aldehyde with ethyl diazoacetate in the presence of
a catalytic amount of tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) (Scheme 1). The mechanism
of the reaction is likely to proceed via a betaine intermediate, followed
by a preferential migration of the aldehyde hydrogen to the β-carbon
i.e., a 1,2-hydride shift producing the required β-keto ester
and N2 as products. The two most noteworthy aspects of
this method are its selectivity and the mild conditions involved.
The reaction is insensitive to atmosphere, is complete between 1 and
2 h at room temperature, and can be catalyzed by various Lewis acids,
such as BF3, ZnCl2, ZnBr2, AlCl3, SnCl2, GeCl2, and SnCl4, but the highest yield is obtained with SnCl2.33 Although other common organic solvents can be
used, CH2Cl2 is often employed because it gives
the best results and can be easily removed.

The α-alkylacetoacetates
required for the synthesis of coumarins
in the 3-substituted-4-methyl series were prepared conveniently by
treating a solution of ethyl acetoacetate in CH2Cl2 with the corresponding alkyl bromide in the presence of potassium
carbonate (K2CO3) and tetrabutylammonium chloride
(Bu4NCl) (Scheme 2).34

Sulfamates

Pechmann synthesis of coumarins
with a β-keto ester and resorcinol
was carried out in the presence of an equimolar mixture of trifluoroacetic
acid (CF3COOH) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) warmed from ice-water temperature to room temperature
(Schemes 3 and 4). The use of a 1:1 mixture
of conc. H2SO4 and conc. CF3COOH
as the condensing agent for the Pechmann synthesis of coumarins was
first described by Hua et al.,35 and, in
our hands, such a mixture has been found to be as effective as using
conc. H2SO4 alone, which is playing a role as
a catalyst. The role of conc. CF3COOH in this reaction
is not entirely clear, although it might be acting as an organic solvent
and lowering the viscosity of the reaction mixture, rendering the
stirring process more efficient.

The sulfamoylation reaction was performed
by reacting the hydroxyl
coumarins with an excess of (∼5 equiv) sulfamoyl chloride after
treating with 1 equiv of NaH as described previously by Woo et al.36

Biological Results and Discussion
The in vitro inhibition of STS activity by most of the sulfamates
synthesized in this work was measured in two assay systems: (i) a
preparation of an intact monolayer of MCF-7 cells, which assesses
the ability of compounds to cross the cell membrane and inhibit STS
under conditions that closely resemble the tissue/physiological situation
and (ii) a placental microsomes preparation where a higher concentration
of substrate is employed, with which a compound has to compete for
binding to the enzyme active site. For the placental microsome STS
assay, a saturating substrate concentration of 20 μM was used
and inhibitors were tested under initial rate conditions. The MCF-7
STS assay is meant to mimic/reflect physiological conditions (intact,
living cells). Hence, a physiological concentration of 3 nM of E1S
was used. The results are reported as % inhibition at various concentrations,
and IC50 values are determined for several compounds (Tables 1–4). Although time- and concentration-dependence studies
have not been carried out to confirm the nature of inhibition for
those compounds tested, it is anticipated that they act mechanistically
in a similar manner to other aryl sulfamates like 1 and 2, which have been shown to be active-site-directed inhibitors

4-Substituted Compounds
MCF-7
For 4-n-alkyl derivatives 9–15, 17, and 18, all derivatives
inhibit STS activity >90% at 1 μM. Based
on the % inhibition observed at 0.1 and 0.01 μM, the inhibitory
activity of the compounds increases slightly as the chain length of
the alkyl group increases, and it peaks at the nonyl (14, 90% at 0.01 μM) and decyl (15, 86% at 0.01 μM)
derivatives. This may be attributed to the increase in lipophilicity
of the compounds as their alkyl group becomes longer until steric
hindrance potentially becomes a limiting factor. A similar observation
was reported in studies of (p-O-sulfamoyl)-N-alkanoyl tyramines.37,38 We and others have
also noted the existence of a hydrophobic pocket at the end of the
steroid binding pocket39 that might also
be accessed by the present compound series to improve binding, although
seeking the right compromise between hydrophobicity and steric hindrance
is important.40 For other substituents
at the 4-position of the coumarin ring, their inhibitory activities
vary with the phenethyl derivative 24 (39% at 0.01 μM,
IC50 = 18 nM) and the cyclohexyl derivative 26 (37% at 0.01 μM, IC50 = 24 nM) being the most active.
However, both 24 and 26 are less potent
as STS inhibitors than the 4-n-alkyl derivatives.
One possibility is that the active site of STS, like many other enzymes
with steroids as substrate in general, has limited accommodation for
substituents at the C1/C11/C12 edge of the steroid scaffold. Hence,
the more flexible aliphatic alkyl chains may be better tolerated by
the enzyme active site than the bulkier and more rigid substituents
such as phenyl, benzyl, phenethyl, 4-ethylphenyl, and cyclohexyl when
these substituents are placed at the 4-position of the coumarin ring
system, which mimics the A/B ring of the steroidal STS inhibitor 1.

Placental Microsomes
Apart from
the two lower members 3 and 4 and the two
higher members 17 and 18, other 4-n-alkyl derivatives
(5–16) tested show >90% inhibition
at 1 μM. However, the SAR between chain length and inhibitory
activity is not clear because all derivatives evaluated show the same
order of magnitude in regard to % inhibition at 0.01 μM and
IC50 values. Nonetheless, the n-pentyl
(10, IC50 = 40 nM) and n-dodecyl
(17, IC50 = 45 nM) derivatives appear to be
the most active inhibitors in this group. For those derivatives that
have bulkier substituents at the 4-position, they are significantly
less potent than their n-alkyl derivatives with the
exception of 23 (benzyl, IC50 = 64 nM), 24 (phenethyl, IC50 = 82 nM), and 26 (cyclohexyl, IC50 = 42 nM), the IC50 values
of which are of the same order of magnitude as those of n-alkyl derivatives. As expected for a cell-based assay, the IC50 values against STS obtained for compounds in Table 1 are much lower than those obtained
from the cell-free placental microsomes assay (Tables 2 and 3). A similar
phenomenon was observed in previous work.41

3-Substituted-4-methyl Compounds
MCF-7
A relatively
smaller number of synthesized compounds
in this series compared to their 4-substituted relatives were tested
for their inhibitory activities. From the results available, 3-alkylated-4-methyl
compounds 28–33 show >97% inhibition
at 0.1 μM, whereas compounds 39–43, which have other substituents at the 3-position, inhibit STS between
29 and 98% at 0.1 μM. Of those five compounds that have IC50 values determined, 29 is the most potent (0.68
nM), closely followed by 41 and 42 (1 and
1.1 nM, respectively). On comparing 23 (4-benzyl, IC50 = 75 nM, Table 1) and 24 (4-phenethyl, IC50 = 18 nM, Table 1) with 41 (3-benzyl-4-methyl, IC50 = 1 nM) and 42 (3-phenethyl-4-methyl,
IC50 = 1.1 nM), there is 1 order of magnitude difference
between the potency of the two pairs of compounds. This finding suggests
that placing either a benzyl or a phenethyl group at the 3-position
of the coumarin ring produces a more potent STS inhibitor. It is anticipated
that on binding of 41 and 43 into the active
site of STS, the coumarin ring of which is designed to mimic the A/B
ring of 1, their substituents at the 3-position extend
into the same area where the C/D ring of 1 resides.

Placental Microsomes
On the basis of the IC50 values available, it appears that compounds with shorter alkyl chains
at the 3-position of the coumarin ring (28, n-pentyl, IC50 = 12 nM and 29, n-hexyl, IC50 = 32 nM) are more potent STS inhibitors than
those with longer alkyl chains (32–34, 37; IC50 > 300 nM). This contrasts with
those compounds in the 4-alkylated series (Table 2) the IC50 values (40–102
nM) of which are tighter and fall within the same order of magnitude.
This finding suggests that a long alkyl chain placed at the 4-position
of the coumarin ring may interact better with the enzyme active site
than its counterpart placed at the 3-position of the coumarin ring.
To this effect, the sulfamate group of 4-alkylated compounds may be
better positioned within the catalytic site of the enzyme for inactivation.

For compounds 40–43, the inhibitory
activity observed at 0.1 μM starts from 65% for 40 (phenyl) and rises to 94% for 41 (benzyl) before it
falls to 91 and 47% for 42 (phenethyl) and 43 (phenylpropyl), respectively. A similar pattern is observed when
the IC50 values of 40 (54 nM), 41 (8 nM), and 42 (33 nM) are compared. In regard to potency,
the benzyl group is therefore the optimal substituent for this group
of 3-substituted-4-methyl coumarin sulfamates. It is possible that
the phenyl, phenethyl, and phenylpropyl groups interact less favorably
with or are less well accommodated by the enzyme active site (Table 4).

When the benzyl group of 41 is replaced
by a cyclohexylmethyl
group to give 44, a reduction in potency is observed
(at 0.1 μM, 94% for 41 vs 74% for 44). The same pattern, but to a greater extent, is observed when the
phenethyl group is replaced by a cyclohexylethyl group as shown by
the 91% inhibition of the STS observed for 42 at 0.1
μM compared to the 37% inhibition for 45 at the
same concentration. This finding suggests that the more rigid and
electron-rich phenyl group may interact better with the enzyme active
site (such as through π-interactions with neighboring amino
acids) than the more flexible aliphatic cyclohexyl group. The best
inhibitors are illustrated in Figure 4, with an attempt to illustrate the mimicry of the
steroidal C and D rings and also with some comparative activities
shown in Table 5.

Molecular Modeling
Docking studies
were conducted to explore potential interactions
between the substituted bicyclic coumarin derivatives and the STS
active site, in a similar fashion to those carried out for STX64/Irosustat
and related series members.16 They show
that the two most active compounds 29 and 41 are placed in a very similar fashion to the irreversible STS inhibitor
Irosustat, with the sulfamoyl group in close proximity and opposite
to the catalytic FGly 75 (Figure 5), suggesting that a putative sulfamoyl group transfer
could also readily occur that might lead to similar irreversible inhibition
(although note that no experiments were conducted to explore the reversibility/irreversibility
of 29 and 41 against STS). Residue V486
on one side and residues L103 and V177 on the other sandwich the bicyclic
ring system. Both compounds possibly form a hydrogen bond (N···O
= ∼3.2 Å) from their chromen-2-one oxygen to the NH of
G100 in the same manner as Irosustat (Figure 5). These more potent compounds have fairly
small hydrophobic pendant groups attached to the 3-position of the
chromen-2-one ring. These hydrophobic moieties lie between the hydrophobic
sidechains of L103, F178, and F488. Those compounds with larger pendant
groups may be less active due to the hydrophobic nature of the group
making the compound less soluble. Alternatively, because STS is a
membrane-bound protein and any substrate or inhibitor has to pass
through the membrane to access the active site, it may be that larger
hydrophobic tails result in the inhibitor failing to fully transit
through the membrane: the hydrophobic tail stays, preferentially,
embedded in the membrane.

the crystal structure of human STS. Right: docking of Irosustat (cyan)
and 41 (brown) into the crystal structure of human STS.
In both figures, the Ca2+ ion is depicted as a yellow sphere
and FG75 is the gem-diol form of FGly 75 aldehyde.
The dotted yellow lines are potential hydrogen bonds.

On examining the data in Table 5, where the best compounds are benchmarked
against
the steroidal EMATE and the nonsteroidal Irosustat and, more particularly,
against the known two-ring coumarin sulfamate COUMATE, it is readily
apparent that highly potent compounds have been designed through the
targeted 3- and 4-substitutions undertaken in this work. Some of these
(29, 32, 41, and 42) have a potency approaching the clinical drug Irosustat in the more
definitive intact MCF-7 cell assay, and of these, 29 is
highly significant with a similar picomolar IC50. Compound 41 is perhaps of the widest interest with an IC50 of 1 nM but also with an inhibitory activity better than that of
Irosustat in the more challenging placental microsomal STS assay.
It has an attractive 3-benzyl substituent that, as for the highly
active homolog 42, could potentially be substituted to
further refine activity. Moreover, 41 and 42 are structurally distinct from the fully saturated C-ring surrogate
of Irosustat and, as more versatile compounds, could form the basis
of an attractive series for further optimization and eventual preclinical
development. In any case, if we sensibly take COUMATE 3 for comparison, the best compounds are gratifyingly some 100–500
times more potent in the MCF-7 assay.

Conclusions
Synthetic
routes to two-ring coumarin 7-O-sulfamate
derivatives possessing 3- and 4-modified substitutions were devised,
generally using an α-alkylacetoacetate strategy and the Pechman
hydroxycoumain synthesis.15,17 Compounds were shown
to inhibit, often highly potently, the emerging clinical drug target
STS8 now validated for hormone-dependent
diseases12 using an intact MCF-7 cell assay
and an assay against placental microsomal STS activity. The best compounds
were benchmarked for activity against the steroidal sulfamate drug
EMATE,13 the nonsteroidal Irosustat,12,16 and the known two-ring parent coumarin sulfamate COUMATE.18,19 Through the targeted 3- and 4-substitution strategy undertaken,
highly potent compounds were designed. In intact MCF-7 cells, compounds 29, 32, 41, and 42 had
a potency approaching Irosustat with 29 having an IC50 of 680 pM. 41 had a similar IC50 of 1 nM but was also better than Irosustat against placental microsomal
STS. With COUMATE 3 taken as the most relevant comparative
structural benchmark for non-tricyclic derivatives, the best compounds
were ca. 100–500 times more potent in the MCF-7 assay. Both 41 and 42 possess motifs structurally distinct
from the fully saturated cyclic C-ring of Irosustat with attractive
pendant 3-benzyl and 3-phenethyl substituents, respectively, that
could potentially be further optimized through aromatic substitution.
Compounds 29 and 41 were modeled into STS
in comparison to benchmarks and dock well into the active site, placing
the aryl sulfamate moiety opposite the catalytic FGly, as for Irosustat16 and with their pendant side chains occupying
a hydrophobic pocket noted previously.39 The expectation is that, in a similar fashion to Irosustat and EMATE,
such compounds will act as irreversible inhibitors by transfer of
their sulfamoyl group to the STS enzyme,12b,13b although this has not been formally explored here. Thus, the versatile
3-benzyl-4-methyl- and 3-phenethyl-4-methyl-derivatives 41 and 42, respectively, and possibly also the 3-n-hexyl-4-methyl-derivative 29 from this study
are potent STS inhibitors and could represent new leads for potential
preclinical development.

Experimental Section
In Vitro Steroid Sulfatase
Assay
STS inhibitory assays
were performed essentially as previously described.13b,43 The ability of the compounds synthesized to inhibit E1S was tested
in vitro using MCF-7 cells and a placental microsomal preparation
from a sulfatase-positive human placenta from a normal term pregnancy
and compared with that of EMATE. For the placental microsome STS assay,
a saturating substrate concentration of 20 μM was used and inhibitors
were tested under initial rate conditions. For the MCF-7 STS assay,
a physiological concentration of 3 nM E1S was used. Thus, for the
placental microsome assay: [E1S] = 20 μM, [I] = 0.1 nM to 10
μM; MCF-7: [E1S] = 3 nM, [I] = 0.1 nM to 10 μM (NB for
highly potent compounds, this was changed to 0.1 pM to 10 nM).

Chemicals
and Analyses
All reagents were purchased
commercially either from Aldrich Chemicals Co. (Gillingham, Dorset,
U.K.) or Lancaster synthesis (Morecambe, Lancashire, U.K.). All organic
solvents used were of general purpose or analytical grade and were
obtained from Fisons Plc. (Loughborough, U.K.) and stored over 4 Å
molecular sieves. Anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) used for all sulfamoylation
reactions was purchased from Aldrich and was stored under a positive
pressure of N2 after use. Sulfamoyl chloride was prepared
by adapting a method originally reported by Appel and Berger44 and was stored as a standard solution in purified
sulfur-free dry toluene.36

Thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was carried out using precoated plates (Merck
TLC aluminum sheets silica gel 60 F254, art. no. 5554). Product(s)
and starting material were detected by treating plates with a methanolic
solution of phosphomolybdic acid followed by heating or simply by
viewing directly under UV light. Flash column chromatography was carried
out by gradient elution (solvents used are indicated in the text)
on wet-packed silica gel (Sorbsil C60). IR spectra were recorded using
a PerkinElmer 782 spectrophotometer with peak positions expressed
in cm–1. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded using either a Jeol Delta 270 MHz or Varian Mercury
VX 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in
parts per million (ppm) using an internal standard of tetramethylsilane.
Coupling constants (J) are quoted to the nearest
0.1 Hz. Mass spectra were acquired at the Mass Spectrometry Service
Centre, Bath and FAB mass spectra used m-nitrobenzyl
alcohol as matrix. Elemental analyses were carried out by the Microanalysis
Service, Bath. Melting points are uncorrected and were determined
using a Reichert-Jung Thermo Galen Kofler block. High-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a Waters 660E instrument
equipped with an autosampler and photo diode array detector. A Waters
Radialpak column (RP18, 8 mm × 100 mm) was used. The conditions
of elution and analytical data are as indicated for each compound
analyzed.

Molecular Modeling
Schrödinger software (running
under Maestro 9.0) was used to build and minimize all of the ligands.
The ALS75 residue in PDB crystal structure 1P49 (human placental estrone/dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfatase) was mutated to the gem-diol form using
the Schrödinger software editing tools. Minimization of the
resulting structure, with the position of the backbone atoms fixed,
allowed the atoms of the gem-diol and surrounding
side chains to adopt low-energy conformations. Ligands were docked
into the rigid protein using GOLD. A 10 Å sphere centered on
the ALS75 sulfate was defined as the binding site. The GOLDScore fitness
function was used to score the docked poses (25 for each ligand).

General Methods for the Synthesis of Ethyl 3-Oxo-alkanoates
for the Preparation of 4-Alkylcoumarin Sulfamates
Method A31
To ethyl potassium
malonate (2.1 equiv) in MeCN (100 mL/5 g of acid chloride) at 10–15
°C and under N2 was added Et3N (3.2 equiv),
followed by MgCl2 (2.5 equiv). The mixture was stirred
at 20–25 °C for 2.5 h and then at 0 °C for 0.5 h
before the corresponding acid chloride (1 equiv) was added dropwise
during 25 min. The mixture was further treated with Et3N (5 mL) and stirred overnight at 20 °C. The evaporation residue
was dissolved in toluene and re-concentrated. More toluene was added,
stirred, and cooled to 10–15 °C before aq HCl (1 M, 50
mL) was added cautiously while keeping the temperature <25 °C.
The organic layer was washed with 1 M aq HCl (50 mL) and water. Drying,
evaporation, and distillation or chromatography (CHCl3 or
CHCl3/acetone, 10:1) gave the corresponding ethyl α-alkanoylacetate.

Method B33
To anhydrous
SnCl2 (0.1 equiv) was added CH2Cl2 (∼100 mL/5 g of aldehyde), followed by ethyl diazoacetate
(1.05 equiv). The reaction was initiated by adding a few drops of
the corresponding aldehyde in CH2Cl2. When N2 evolution began, the remaining solution of aldehyde (1 equiv)
was added dropwise over 30 min. After the evolution of N2 had stopped (∼1–3 h), the mixture was washed with
brine (50 mL) and extracted twice (Et2O). Drying, evaporation,
and chromatography (CHCl3 or CHCl3/acetone,
10:1) or distillation gave the corresponding ethyl alkanoylacetate.

General Method for the Synthesis of Ethyl α-Alkylacetoacetates
for the Preparation of 3-Alkyl-4-methylcoumarin Sulfamates34
K2CO3 (2.4 equiv),
water (50 mL), alkyl bromide (1 equiv), ethyl acetoacetate (1 equiv),
CH2Cl2 (50 mL/5 g of alkyl bromide), and Bu4NCl (1 or 2 equiv) were boiled under reflux for 3 days. After
cooling, the separated organic layer was washed with 5 M aq HCl (30
mL). The mixture was extracted twice with Et2O. The combined
ethereal extracts were dried, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo.
Chromatography (CHCl3 or CHCl3/acetone 10:1)
or distillation gave the corresponding ethyl α-alkylacetoacetate.

General Method for the Synthesis of 3- or 4-Alkyl-7-hydroxycoumarins17
Resorcinol (1 equiv) was dissolved
in the corresponding hot β-keto ester (1 equiv). The resulting
syrup was cooled to 0 °C and treated dropwise with a mixture
of CF3COOH (2 equiv) and conc. H2SO4 (2 equiv) while keeping the temperature <10 °C. After stirring
for 3 h at room temperature, the mixture was cautiously quenched with
ice-water. The brightly colored gluey mass formed was stirred for
further 1 h. The bright yellow/brown precipitate resulted was collected
by suction filtration, washed exhaustively with water, and re-dissolved
in acetone. The yellow/brown solid obtained upon evaporation was purified
by flash chromatography (CHCl3/acetone, 8:1 to 4:1 gradient)
and/or recrystallized from hot absolute ethanol, acetone/hexane (4:1),
or THF/hexane (2:0.5) to give the corresponding coumarin as a crystalline
solid.

General Method for the Sulfamoylation Reaction15
To a solution of the compound (1 equiv) in anhydrous
DMF (5 mL) at 0 °C under N2 was added NaH (1 equiv).
When the evolution of H2 had ceased, previously prepared
sulfamoyl chloride (∼3–5 equiv) was introduced. After
stirring at room temperature under N2 overnight, the mixture
was quenched with ice-water. The organic fractions were extracted
into ethyl acetate (∼150 mL) and washed with brine (4 ×
100 mL). Drying, evaporation, chromatography (CHCl3/ethyl
acetate, 8:1 to 2:1 gradient), and/or recrystallization with either
ethyl acetate/hexane (5:2) or THF/hexane (2:1) gave the corresponding
crystalline sulfamate.

Upon sulfamoylation, 9b (700 mg, 3.21 mmol)
gave a crude white solid, which was fractionated by flash chromatography
(CHCl3/ethyl acetate, 8:1 to 2:1 gradient). The white solid
isolated was recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane to give 9 as white crystals (98 mg, 10%): Rf = 0.36 (CHCl3/ethyl acetate, 4:1); mp 147–150
