Introduction
Catalytic dimerization
of terminal alkynes provides a simple and
atom economic preparative route to conjugated enynes, which are useful
building blocks for the synthesis of functional materials and biologically
active compounds, and a number of transition metal complex catalysts
of precious metals, such as palladium, ruthenium, and rhodium, have
been developed.1−3 Despite these advances, effective control of regio-
and stereoselectivity has been a long-standing challenge due to the
potential formation of a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-isomers and gem-stereoisomer, which
limits the application of this process.1−3 The nature of the metal,
specific ligand sphere, and substituents on alkyne substrate are the
main parameters that govern the regio- and stereoselectivity of the
catalyst.2 Solvents could also play a role
in the selectivity, as observed in the reaction catalyzed by the combination
of Rh(CO)(PPh3)2Cl/K2CO3/ICH3.2,4 The abundance of iron, the relatively
low toxicity of many iron compounds, and a broad spectrum of accessible
oxidation states and spin states of iron species render iron a versatile
catalytic metal for organic reactions, and iron-catalyzed organic
transformations have become increasingly important and attractive.5−7 Recently, the use of iron in the catalytic dimerization of alkynes
has received considerable research interest.8−13 Dash et al. first reported the combinative use of FeCl3 (30 mol %) and an amine or phosphine as catalyst in the presence
of KOtBu in the dimerization of terminal
aryl alkynes.8,9 Subsequently, it was found that
the iron(II) PNP pincer complexes,  [Fe(H)(BH4)(iPrPNP)]10 and [Fe(PNP)(H)2(η2-H2)],11 could efficiently catalyze the dimerization of arylacetylenes to
yield Z-selective enynes under mild conditions. Iron(II)
complex containing picolyl N-heterocyclic carbene ligands could achieve
gem-specific dimerization of terminal aryl alkynes.12 Iron(0) complex with cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene ligand
has also been reported to be active toward the same type of reactions
with E selectivity (up to 84:16 of E/Z) in the presence of KOtBu.13 Inspired by these recent advances,
and as part of our continual interest in using easily accessible metal
salts and complexes as catalyst for C–C bond formation reactions,14−19 we herein reported the catalytic activity of a series of iron(II)
complexes (Fe1–Fe4)14 with functionalized amine-pyrazolyl tripodal ligands toward the
dimerization of terminal aryl alkynes and an unusual KOtBu- and NaOtBu-controlled E/Z selectivity. The microwave-irradiation-assisted
dimerization of terminal aryl alkynes catalyzed by these iron complexes
has also been studied, and different activities of the catalyst in
the presence of KOtBu and NaOtBu have been observed.

Results and Discussion
It was reported that the combination of anhydrous FeCl2/DMEDA (DMEDA = N,N-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine)
(30 mol % loading for each) could give the dimerization product of
phenylacetylene (1a), 1,4-diphenylbut-1-ene-3-yne (2a), in 63% yield (E/Z =
67:33) in the presence of KOtBu (3 equiv)
at 145 °C after 2 h and FeCl3 (30 mol %) alone could
afford 2a in only 42% yield (E/Z = 77:23).8 As shown in Table 1, under the same reaction
conditions, we found that with only 5 mol % of common iron(II) salt
FeCl2·4H2O as catalyst, 2a could be obtained in 78% yields (E/Z = 3:1) (entry 1).8 Encouraged by this
result, we further explored the catalytic activity of a series of
iron(II) complexes Fe1–Fe4 (Figure 1) obtained from the reaction between FeCl2·4H2O and the corresponding functionalized
amine-pyrazolyl tripodal ligands.14 The
hybrid ligands in Fe1–Fe4 present diverse coordination
modes to the metal center depending on the nature of the tether function
on the central amine moiety, leading to four-, five-, and six-coordinate
iron(II) centers.14 These complexes could
thus be a good model complex to study the effect of coordination geometry
of metal center on catalytic performance.

Using KOtBu, Fe1–Fe3 (5 mol %) could
produce 2a in 76–78% yield but
with improved E selectivity (E/Z = 4:1) (entries 2–4) compared to that of FeCl2·4H2O (cf. entry 1). Neither starting material
nor gem-stereoisomer could be observed on the basis
of both NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses.
Compound Fe4, which contains a six-coordinate iron center,
produced 2a in a slightly lower yield (72%, entry 5).
Conducting the reaction for only 1 h, or at 85 °C, or using THF
as the solvent led to a lower yield of 2a (entries 6–8).
When the amount of KOtBu was reduced from
3 equiv to 1 equiv with respect to that of the alkyne, 2a was obtained in a lower yield (62%) (entry 9). In the absence of
KOtBu, no reaction took place (entry 10).
Using other bases, such as Na2CO3, K2CO3, NEt3, and LiOtBu, the reaction could not proceed (entries 11 and 12).

It
was reported that using NaOtBu as
base additive FeCl3/DMEDA gave 2a in a very
low yield (<5%).9 It is thus intriguing
to note that in the presence of NaOtBu, Fe2, and Fe3 showed not only good activity (ca.
70% yield of 2a), but also a reversal of the stereoselectivity
(E/Z = 33:67) compared with those
obtained when using KOtBu as the base
(entries 3 and 4 cf. entries 13 and 14). It was reported that reacting 1a with 2 equiv of KOtBu at 135–140
°C in dimethylformamide for 4 days gave (2-tert-butoxyvinyl)benzene in 80% yield without any byproducts.20 Dash et al. found that the reaction between 1a and 3 equiv of KOtBu (in toluene
at 145 °C for 2 h) could give (2-tert-butoxyvinyl)benzene
as the main product (63% yield) and 2a (11% yield, E/Z = 77:23) as a byproduct.8 However, we found that under both oil-bath heating
(145 °C, 2 h) and microwave radiation (145 °C, 10 min, vide
infra) conditions, 2a was obtained in less than 2% yield
only (NMR yield) when mixing KOtBu or
NaOtBu with 1a (3:1) in toluene
(entries 15 and 16). Trace amounts of (2-tert-butoxyvinyl)benzene
could be observed for the reactions with KOtBu. GC-MS showed the unreacted 1a in the reaction mixture
for all cases. In spite of the very low yield of 2a,
it is interesting to note that the reaction with KOtBu has an E selectivity, whereas NaOtBu alone gives the reaction a Z selectivity. However, when FeCl2·4H2O
was used as the catalyst, 2a was obtained in only 8%
yield with an E/Z ratio of 50:50
(entry 17), suggesting the effect of the amine-pyrazolyl tripodal
ligands on both catalytic activity and E/Z selectivity.

The substrate scope study was performed
using Fe3 as
catalyst in the presence of KOtBu or NaOtBu. Microwave-assisted organic synthesis can
greatly shorten the reaction time and/or increase the yield compared
to that in conventional heating, and it has been widely used in different
types of reactions.21,22 Therefore, microwave irradiation
heating technique was also applied in these reactions as an alternative
to the conventional oil-bath heating method. The results are shown
in Table 2. An array
of terminal arylacetylenes could be dimerized to the head-to-head
products in moderate to excellent yield using the oil-bath heating
method. In general, the ethynylbenzene derivatives with electron-donating
substituents gave higher yields than those with electron-withdrawing
groups. For para-electron-donating group substituted acetylenes, the
yields of the dimerization products ranged between 82 and 94%, with
the ratio of E and Z head-to-head
dimers being ca. 4:1 when using KOtBu
(entries 3, 5, 7, and 9). When NaOtBu
was used as base, the E/Z ratio
was nearly the same (36:64) as the yields ranging between 74 and 97%
(entries 4, 6, 8, and 10). Electron-deficient para-fluorophenylacetylene produced the corresponding dimer 2f in 71% with an E/Z ratio of 36:64
in the presence of NaOtBu, whereas for
the reaction with KOtBu, 2f was obtained only in moderate yield (Table 2, entries 11 and 12). KOtBu and NaOtBu gave similar yields
of dimers (60–78%) when the meta-substituted phenylacetylenes
were used as substrate (entries 13–18). Interestingly, in the
presence of KOtBu, no reaction proceeded
when using the sterically most hindered substrates bearing an ortho-substituent
such as 1j and 1k; however, the reactions
with NaOtBu could afford head-to-head
dimers in 65 and 45% yield, respectively, with an E/Z ratio of 55:45 (entries 19–22). Apart
from the E/Z selectivity, it suggests
that the difference (mainly the size difference) between sodium and
potassium ions also has an effect on the activity of the Fe(II) complexes
used in this work. This effect becomes significant for the sterically
most congested substrates.

The reaction condition screening using the microwave
irradiation
heating method showed that 90% yield of 2a could be obtained
after the 10 min reaction at 145 °C when using KOtBu as base. Under microwave irradiation, the products
could be obtained in higher yields for nearly all cases with similar
or only slightly lower E selectivity compared to
using the oil-bath heating method. For example, the dimerization of
the phenylacetylenes with the electron-donating group at the para-position
could afford the products in nearly quantitative yield (entries 3,
5, 7, and 9). 1-Chloro-2-ethynylbenzene could be converted to the
dimer in 41% yield; however, no reaction occurred under oil-bath heating
conditions (entry 21). It is quite surprising that under the microwave
conditions, the reactions with NaOtBu
either could not proceed or afforded products in lower yields than
those obtained using the oil-bath heating method. By extending the
irradiation time to 30 min or even 1 h, the yield of 2a increased only slightly (from 21 to 30%).

Selective cross-coupling
between two different terminal alkynes
is much more challenging due to the issues of chemo-, regio-, and
stereoselectivity compared with the homo-coupling of terminal alkynes.2 For the terminal arylacetylenes, which have little
steric and/or electronic differences, poor selectivity of the cross-coupling
products is expected. Using Fe3 as catalyst and KOtBu as base (145 °C, 2 h), the reaction
between phenylacetylene (1a) and 1-ethynyl-4-methylbenzene
(1b) gave a mixture of the homo-coupling products 2a (≈37% yield based on 1a) and 2b (≈50% yield based on 1b) and the cross-coupling
products (≈31% yield) based on the 1H NMR spectrum
and GC-MS analyses of the reaction mixture.

Failure of NaOtBu to yield product
in the FeCl3/DMEDA-catalyzed dimerization of terminal alkyne
has been attributed to the strong cation−π interaction
between the sodium cation and the toluene solvent, which restricts
its binding to the benzene ring of the phenylacetylene.9 Our present results clearly indicate that such
a cation−π interaction has little effect on the catalytic
activity. Furthermore, a radical involved mechanism has been proposed
for FeCl3/DMEDA- and FeCl2/DMEDA-catalyzed reactions
because no reaction occurred upon the addition of 1 equiv galvinoxyl
or TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl) to FeCl3/DMEDA-catalyzed reaction systems.9 In
this mechanism, KOtBu reacts with terminal
alkyne to form an alkene radical and an aryl acetylide, both of which
interact with iron(II/III) complexes to form catalytically active
hexacoordinate iron(IV) species.9 However,
a radical pathway for the Fe3-catalyzed reaction could
be excluded because when 0.5 or 1 equiv of the common radical inhibitor,
TEMPO or butylated hydroxytoluene, was added to the reaction mixture
with KOtBu as base, respectively, the
yield of 2a only slightly dropped to ca. 69% (cf. 78% Table 1 entry 4).

This
work presents a rare example of the catalytic dimerization
of terminal alkynes with the E/Z selectivity determined by the base additive. To shed some light
on the reaction mechanism, especially the base-dependent E/Z selectivity, the reactions of Fe3 with 1a and NaOtBu or KOtBu (1:2:2) in toluene under the catalytic reaction
conditions (145 °C, 2 h) have been studied. Although attempts
to obtain isolable species from the reaction mixture failed, the electrospray
ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) of the reaction mixtures provided
useful information to identify the species that could be related to
the catalytic reaction intermediates. The most striking feature of
the positive-mode spectrum of the reaction mixture with KOtBu as base is the presence of a series of signals
starting from the peak at m/z 668
with an m/z value difference of
101, which corresponds to a phenylacetylide anion (Figure 2). Among them, the strongest
peak locates at m/z 769, which could
be assigned to Fe(III) oxo enynyl species with tert-butoxido ligand based on the m/z value and the isotope pattern. The presence of oxo ligand could
be due to the exposure to air, whereas the presence of enynyl moiety
is closely responsible for the formation of the (E or Z) head-to-head 1,3-enynes.2 The potassium cation could interact with both the OtBu ligand and the enynyl moiety. The signal
of m/z 668 could be assigned to
iron(II) acetylide tert-butoxido species. The other
peaks with an increment of m/z of
101 could be derived from further coordination of the acetylide ligand,
which can explain the formation of the oligomer byproducts of the
dimerization reactions. The reaction mixture with NaOtBu does not give analogous fragments; however, the
signals corresponding to the structure of Fe3 have been
observed, such as [Fe3-Cl]+ and iron(II) acetylide
species.

Figure 2 Positive-mode ESI-MS of the reaction mixture of Fe3 with 1a and KOtBu (1:2:2)
in toluene under the catalytic reaction conditions (145 °C, 2
h).

On the basis of the general mechanism
of transition-metal-complex-catalyzed
dimerization of alkyne2 and the results
mentioned above, a tentative reaction mechanism via metal acetylide–vinylidene
pathway has been proposed, as shown in Scheme 1. In the first step, Fe3 reacts
with 1a in the presence of NaOtBu or KOtBu to form complex I, an iron(II) acetylide complex containing a tert-butoxido ligand. The interactions between K+ or Na+ with the acetylide ligand and the O donor of the tert-butoxido ligand lead to the species II-K or II-Na, supported by the fragment with m/z 668, as shown in Figure 2. Subsequent reaction of II-K or II-Na with another molecule of 1a yields
the iron(II) alkynyl complex III-K or III-Na, which further transforms into the vinylidene rotamer intermediates IV.2,10,13,23−25 These intermediates
may interchange. Migration of the acetylide ligand to the α-carbon
of the vinylidene generates iron(II) enynyl species V, evident from the fragment with m/z 769 in Figure 2.
Coordination of another terminal alkyne and the following proton transfer
from the coordinated alkyne lead to the release of the E or Z enyne product and the regeneration of species II. The E/Z selectivity
of the reaction could be determined by the relative magnitude of the
steric interactions between Na+ or K+ ion with
the vinylidene and the acetylide ligands. When using KOtBu, the significant steric repulsions between the
relatively large K+ and the ligands cause the IV-K-E to be favored, whereas the repulsion is reduced
when NaOtBu is used as base and IV-Na-Z becomes favored, which could explain
the base-dependent reversal of E/Z selectivity observed in this work. In the presence of a different
base NaOtBu or KOtBu, the different reactivity of Fe3 to the sterically
most hindered substrates bearing an ortho-substituent such as 1j and 1k could be also explained. The tripodal
NNN ligands used serve as a backbone to define the steric size of
the catalyst.

Scheme 1 Tentative Reaction Mechanism of Fe3-Catalyzed
Dimerization
of Phenylacetylene in the Presence of NaOtBu or KOtBu
As the system may be complicated by the dissociation and
association
of the coordinating atoms of the ligand, alkali-metal cation, tert-butoxide, phenylacetylene, and so on, in the course
of the reaction, we chose to employ DFT to compute the stationary
points of II and III and to evaluate the
steps from IV to V based on the proposed
mechanism as the atom counts are unchanged. Importantly, three different
spin states were evaluated, namely, singlet, triplet, and quintet
states, and in all steps, including the transition states, the high
spin iron center (quintet) exhibits the lowest energies (Supporting
Information, Figures S26 and S27). II and V were found to be among the most thermodynamically
favored species, consistent with the ESI-MS analysis, where the hydrolyzed
and oxidized forms of II-K and V-K were
observed. However, the processes for the conversion from IV from V for both Na+ and K+ leading
to E and Z were found to proceed
via relatively small energy barriers in favor of E conformers, suggesting that IV to V is
unlikely the rate- and regio-selectivity-determining step (Supporting
Information, Figure S28).

Conclusions
Iron(II) complexes with functionalized amine-pyrazolyl tripodal
ligands (Fe1–Fe4) showed good catalytic activity
and selectivity toward the dimerization of terminal alkynes in the
presence of a base (KOtBu or NaOtBu). In general, the reactions using KOtBu as base gave higher product yields than those
using NaOtBu. Microwave irradiation applied
well to the reaction with KOtBu with greatly
shortened reaction time and increased yield. Moreover, an unusual E- or Z-selective head-to-head dimerization
of terminal aryl alkynes depending on the bases KOtBu and NaOtBu was achieved.
DFT calculations indicate that the iron species exist in the high
spin state, but the origin of the remarkable alkali-metal ion-dependent
regio-selectivity requires further mechanistic investigation. We believe
that this finding fuels the potential of using a simple base as additive
to adjust E/Z selectivity with further
selectivity enhancement from the judicious choice of hybrid ligands
of the iron complex catalyst.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All preparations and manipulations
were performed using standard Schlenk techniques or conducted in a
glovebox filled with nitrogen gas. All commercial chemicals were used
as purchased. Solvents were dried by standard procedures. 1H and 13C NMR were measured at room temperature (rt) with
a Bruker AMX500 500 MHz and a JEOL 500 MHz FT NMR spectrometer. Electrospray
ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were recorded on a Thermo Finnigan
LCQ spectrometer and Bruker AmaZon-X and a liquid chromatography mass
spectrometer (Shimadzu) LCMS-IT-TOF without performing LC separation.
GC-MS analyses were recorded on an Agilent 6890N/5973N system. Microwave-assisted
reactions were conducted on a Microwave synthesis reactor (Anton Paar
Monowave 300). The preparation of Fe complexes Fe1–Fe4 was based on the literature procedure.14

Representative Procedure of the Catalytic Dimerization of Phenylacetylene
(1a) Using Fe3 as Catalyst with KOtBu as Base
(1) Conventional oil-bath heating method:
To a 25 mL Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stir bar were added Fe3 (11.8 mg, 0.025 mmol), KOtBu (168.3 mg, 1.5 mmol), 1a (51 mg, 0.5 mmol), and toluene
(2 mL) in a glovebox. The reaction mixture in the sealed Schlenk tube
was stirred at rt for 5 min and then heated at 145 °C for 2 h.
(2) Microwave irradiation heating method: To a 10 mL microwave vial
equipped with a magnetic stir bar were added Fe3 (11.8
mg, 0.025 mmol), KOtBu (168.3 mg, 1.5
mmol), 1a (51 mg, 0.5 mmol), and toluene (2 mL) in a
glovebox. The vial was capped with a microwave vial septum. After
stirring for 5 min at rt, the reaction mixture was transferred to
a microwave synthesis reactor and heated to 145 °C under stirring
at 600 rpm for 10 min. For both methods (1) and (2), the reaction
mixture was filtered through a silica pad after cooling to rt and
eluted with diethyl ether (3 × 5 mL). GC-MS measurement was conducted
using the solution obtained. To calculate NMR yield, 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene
(42 mg, 0.25 mmol) as internal standard was added to the solution.
Subsequently, all volatiles were carefully removed on a rotary evaporator,
and the 1H NMR spectrum (in CDCl3) of the residue
was measured. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography
using n-hexane as eluent to give (E/Z)-1,4-dipenylbut-1-ene-3-yne (2a)
as colorless solids.

Computational Details
Gaussian 09
program, version
D.01, was used to perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations.26 Becke’s three-parameter functional with
the nonlocal Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional theory
was applied together with the 6-31G(d,p) Pople basis set and the SDD
effective core potential, which was used to describe the nonreactive
core electrons of the metal.27 Tight convergence
criteria and ultrafine integral were used for all optimizations. All
optimizations to ground states were confirmed by frequency calculations
by making sure that there were zero imaginary frequencies and all
SCF criteria had been met. Good transition state guesses were found
by scanning relevant bond lengths and angles using the modredundant
keyword, and using them as inputs for the transition state optimizations,
the noeigentest keyword was always applied. The transition state optimizations
were confirmed by frequency calculations by making sure that one imaginary
frequency was present and that the vibrational motion represented
the relevant step of the reaction. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations
were performed in forward and reverse directions to confirm the transition
state connected to the relevant structures in the reaction mechanism.
