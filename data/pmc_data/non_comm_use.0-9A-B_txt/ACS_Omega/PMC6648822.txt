New
nanocomposites have been prepared by combining tin selenide
(SnSe) with graphene oxide (GO) in a simple aqueous solution process
followed by ice templating (freeze casting). The resulting integration
of SnSe within the GO matrix leads to modifications of electrical
transport properties and the possibility of influencing the power
factor (S2σ). Moreover, these transport
properties can then be further improved (S, σ
increased) by functionalization of the GO surface to form modified
nanocomposites (SnSe/GOmod) with enhanced power factors
in comparison to unmodified nanocomposites (SnSe/GO) and “bare”
SnSe itself. Functionalizing the GO by reaction with octadecyltrimethoxysilane
(C21H46O3Si) and triethylamine ((CH3CH2)3N) switches SnSe from p-type to
n-type conductivity with an appreciable Seebeck coefficient and high
electrical conductivity (1257 S·m–1 at 539
K), yielding a 20-fold increase in the power factor compared to SnSe
itself, prepared by the same route. These findings present new possibilities
to design inexpensive and porous nanocomposites based on metal chalcogenides
and functionalized carbon-derived matrices.

1 Introduction
Sustainable
means of energy storage and conversion are vital globally,
given the economic, security, and environmental concerns associated
with fossil fuels. There is an urgent need to consume less power and
improve energy efficiency. Thermoelectric materials have been studied
for many years and offer a very convenient method of converting waste
heat into useful power. However, the efficiency of this process is
too low to be cost-effective.1,2

The conversion
efficiency of thermoelectric materials is determined
by the figure of merit,3ZT = S2σT/κ,
where σ is the electrical conductivity, S is
the Seebeck coefficient, T is the temperature, and
κ is the thermal conductivity. To maximize the ZT value, a high Seebeck coefficient is required, coupled with small
thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity. Nanostructuring
can very effectively enhance ZT, where most notably
the high density of interfaces can improve phonon scattering, decreasing
the lattice thermal conductivity.

Tin selenide (SnSe) is a narrow
band gap, binary IV–VI semiconductor,
suitable for various optoelectronic applications like memory switching
devices, photovoltaics, and light emitting devices. It has also emerged
as a highly promising thermoelectric material over the last 4 years.4 SnSe is characterized by excellent energy conversion
efficiency, low cost, and high earth abundance of the component elements.5−10 Most current research has been concentrated mainly on p-type SnSe11−15 and conversely n-type SnSe16−18 is more difficult to achieve.
The high efficiency of SnSe as a thermoelectric material is determined
to a great extent by the method of its production. To synthesize SnSe
with appreciable ZT values, the use of toxic chemicals,
high annealing temperatures, and long processing times is required.
Alternative solution-based syntheses can be used to produce nanostructured
SnSe in bulk quantities under much milder and simpler conditions,
but use of surfactants to control growth and morphology can lead to
relatively meagre thermoelectric properties.19

Recently, graphene-based materials have been explored for
their
potential as thermoelectrics.20,21 With appropriate nanostructuring
and band gap engineering, studies have demonstrated that both the
lattice thermal conductivity of carbon derivatives can be reduced
and the Seebeck coefficient can be enhanced without dramatically decreasing
electrical conductivity.22 Various graphene
nanostructures have thus been predicted to possess ZT values sufficient to make them attractive for energy conversion.22 Similarly, the chemical modification of the
graphene or graphene oxide (GO) surface provides alternative routes
to engineer the mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. For
instance, experiments show that aromatic molecules tethered to graphene
layers can increase the power factor by a factor of 8 compared to
that of an unmodified graphene film.23 Carbon
is light, abundant, relatively cheap, and easily recyclable and so
it presents a number of other attractions in terms of a potential
thermoelectric.24 However, neither pure
graphene nor GO have yet demonstrated a superior thermoelectric performance
experimentally.

The best examples of SnSe thermoelectric performance
arise in large,
dense single crystals, whereas bulk powders (especially, some of those
synthesized under mild conditions) can often exhibit relatively mediocre ZT values compared to such crystals. Emerging studies over
the last 5 years have begun to demonstrate that graphene and its derivatives
can be used effectively as a component in composite materials, where
either graphene is added in small concentrations to influence the
grain boundaries or is employed to “wrap” nanoparticles
of the active thermoelectric material. Examples in Bi2Te3, PbTe, and skutterudite systems demonstrate that charge carrier
concentrations can be increased, the nature of the charge carriers
altered (as manifested in a change of the sign of Seebeck coefficients),
and thermal properties improved by increased phonon scattering at
defects and grain boundaries.25−27 Given the need to improve the
thermoelectric properties of bulk SnSe and given the chemical flexibility
associated with functionalizing carbons, an interesting alternative
approach could thus be to engineer nanoscale composites comprising
the selenide and modified GO. Although there are some reports of the
application of types of SnSe/GO-based composite materials in photodetectors,28,29 photocatalytic devices,30 and sodium-ion
batteries,31 to the best of our knowledge,
there are no existing reports of SnSe/GO-hierarchical nanocomposite
materials or of using SnSe/GO composites for thermoelectric applications.

In this work, we demonstrate how it is possible to make SnSe nanocomposites
with GO as a “host” matrix. The materials can be produced
in bulk quantities and potentially cast into bespoke, well-defined,
shaped, and sized monoliths. Additionally, we show that chemically
modifying (functionalising) the surface structure of the GO component
is an effective way to manipulate the thermoelectric properties of
the SnSe/GO nanocomposites. The rationale behind the functionalzation
of the GO component was first to modify the surface chemically with
amine groups in aqueous media to produce hydroxyl groups, which act
as electron donors and second to expand the interlayer distance between
GO layers (using octadecyltriethoxysilane), thus preventing agglomeration
and creating local structural disorder at the GO surface. Subsequent
experiments show that both the electrical conductivity and Seebeck
coefficient of the nanocomposites are influenced by functionalization.
This approach suggests a new direction for modifying the thermoelectric
performance of chalcogenides and lays the foundations for the design
of other kinds of GO-based thermoelectric composites.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of GO
GO nanosheets were
prepared by the improved Hummers’ method.32,33 In detail, a 9:1 mixture of concentrated of H2SO4/H3PO4 (360:40 mL; analytical reagent
grade, Fisher and 85% aq, Alfa-Aesar, respectively) was added to a
mixture of graphene flakes (3.0 g; graphene nanoplatelet aggregates,
Alfa-Aesar) and KMnO4 (18.0 g; ACS reagent >99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich),
in a mildly exothermic process at 40 °C. The mixture was subsequently
heated to 50 °C and stirred for 16 h before cooling with ice
and water (400 mL). Once cooled, 30% of H2O2 (7 mL; 30%, VWR) was added slowly to the reaction mixture, which
was subsequently stirred for 5–6 h until the mixture color
changed from light yellow to brown. The product was washed with deionized
(DI) water to remove any oxidant residues entirely. The resulting
solution was poured into 40 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for
1 h at 4000 rpm before separating the oxidant residues to yield a
brown solid. The process was repeated more than 10 times until the
product was thoroughly washed. For the preparation of GO dispersions,
the solid products were redispersed in DI and sonicated for 1 h at
200 W. The dispersions were purified by centrifugation for 20 min,
and the upper half of their volume was selected for further studies.

2.2 Synthesis of SnSe Nanoparticles
SnSe
nanoparticles were synthesized via a citric acid-assisted solution
synthesis,19 which includes three steps:
first, 285 mmol citric acid (99.5%, Alfa-Aesar) and 10 mmol SnCl2·2H2O (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved
in 50 mL of DI in a two neck round-bottom flask, so as to prepare
a transparent solution containing Sn2+ ions. Separately,
10 mmol Se (>99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 23 mmol NaBH4 (98%,
Alfa-Aesar) were dissolved in 50 mL of DI in a single-neck round-bottom
flask to prepare sodium hydrogen selenide (sodium biselenide; NaHSe).
In the final stage, NaHSe was injected into the solution of Sn2+ ions, which leads to the direct formation of a black precipitate
of SnSe. The mixture was held at room temperature under Ar (99.998%,
BOC) on a Schlenk line. The product was washed with DI and ethanol
several times. The as-synthesized samples used for characterization
and performance evaluation were stored in an Ar-filled MBraun glovebox
(<0.5 ppm H2O, <0.5 ppm O2) to avoid possible
reaction with air or water.

2.3 Chemical Modification of
GO
As-synthesized
GO was silylated following a procedure similar to that reported for
the silylation of a layered silicate.34−37 First, GO (160 mg) was mixed
with toluene (20 mL; 99%, Alfa-Aesar), and the mixture was sonicated
for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere to form a homogeneous solution.
Octadecyltrimethoxysilane (2 mL) (ODTS; C21H46O3Si; 98% Alfa-Aesar) was added slowly to the GO solution.
Triethylamine (2 mL) (TEA; (CH3CH2)3N; 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the reaction mixture,
which was allowed to stand for 12 h. After 12 h at 50 °C, the
product was washed and centrifuged with ethanol several times.

2.4 Ice-Templating Synthesis of SnSe/GO Nanocomposites
A modified ice-templating method was utilized to prepare SnSe/GO
and SnSe/GOmod nanocomposites.34,38 First, an aqueous solution of SnSe (2.2 g in 100 mL H2O) was mixed with an aqueous dispersion of GO (200 mg in 30 mL H2O) in 100 mL of distilled water and the mixture was sonicated
for 1 h. The sonicated dispersion (100 mL) of nanoparticles was dropped
slowly into a Dewar of liquid nitrogen (600 mL) using a syringe equipped
with a needle. Freezing lasted for 30 min until the suspension was
completely frozen and brown, sponge-like, misshapen beads of SnSe/GO
(with a size of ca. 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm × 2 mm; Scheme 1) were formed. The SnSe/GO
spheres were freeze-dried (Schlenk line at ca. 3 × 10–1 mbar and −196 °C to ambient temperature) and dried further
under vacuum overnight (16 h). The SnSe/GOmod nanocomposite
was prepared following the same procedure described above for SnSe/GO
and by way of example, the overall synthesis procedure for the SnSe/GOmod nanocomposite is shown in Scheme 1 (and in more detail in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information). The modified and unmodified
nanocomposites used for characterization and property measurements
were stored in an Ar-filled MBraun glovebox (<0.5 ppm H2O, <0.5 ppm O2) to avoid any possible reaction with
air or water.

Scheme 1 Synthesis Steps for SnSe/GOmod Nanocomposites
2.5 Materials
Characterization
Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytical
X’pert Pro MPD diffractometer in Bragg–Brentano geometry
(Cu Kα1 radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). Diffraction
data were typically collected in the angular range of 2θ = 5°–60°
for up to 12 h. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy was
performed with a Jasco 4100 FTIR spectrometer operating in the 400–4000
cm–1 spectral range to obtain FTIR spectra at room
temperature. Raman spectroscopy was conducted using a LabRAM HR system
(Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a Ventus 532 laser system operating at 100
mW and 532 nm.

The morphological and structural characteristics
of the synthesized products were investigated by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) using a Carl Zeiss Sigma microscope equipped with
an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Oxford Instruments X-Max
80), with accelerating voltages of 5 and 20 kV for imaging and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. The obtained nanocomposites
were dispersed on a conductive carbon tape attached to a standard
aluminium SEM sample stub.

The microstructure and crystallography
were further investigated
by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) using a JEOL 2011 microscope operated
at 200 kV. TEM samples were prepared by mixing/grinding either SnSe
or nanocomposite (SnSe/GO) powders with acetone in an agate mortar.
Three to six drops of the resulting suspension were dropped onto a
3 mm diameter holey C-coated Cu TEM grid.

2.6 Measurement
of the Electrical and Thermal
Transport Properties of SnSe/GO Nanocomposites
To measure
the performance of the nanocomposites, the samples were loaded into
a graphite die and hot-pressed into pellets at 500 °C for 20
min under Ar protection with a uniaxial pressure of ≈60 MPa.
XRD data (see Supporting Information) and
EDS spectra revealed no significant changes to the composition of
the samples following hot pressing. The obtained pellets were cut
into bars of dimensions 12 mm × 3 mm × 2 mm, and the Seebeck
coefficient and electrical conductivity of the samples were measured
perpendicular to the hot pressing direction using a Linseis LSR-3
instrument under a helium atmosphere over a temperature range of 290–540
K. The uncertainty in the measurement of the Seebeck coefficient and
electrical conductivity is 5%. Electrical measurements were also performed
on samples of SnSe itself (i.e., without addition of GO or modified
GO), prepared by a similar process, for the purposes of comparison.

The total thermal conductivity was calculated through κtot = DCpρ,
where D (the thermal diffusivity) was measured using
a Linseis LFA 1000 instrument under vacuum conditions, over a temperature
range of 290–540 K, Cp (the specific heat) was obtained via DSC measurements (822e
Mettler Toledo), and ρ (the density) was determined from the
sample mass and geometry. Lattice thermal conductivity (κlat) was calculated via the Wiedemann–Franz law, κ
= κtot – LσT, where κtot is the total thermal conductivity, L is the Lorenz number, T is the temperature,
and σ is the electrical conductivity.

3 Results and Discussion
FTIR analysis gives valuable information
about the presence of
different chemical groups on the surface and was used both to confirm
the degree of oxidation of GO and to monitor the passage of surface
reactions after the modification of the GO surface. Figure 1 shows the FTIR spectra of
(a) pristine GO and (b) silylated GO over the range of 500–4000
cm–1. For the pristine GO sample (Figure 1a), characteristic bands are
observed at 822 and 1080–1331 cm–1 (alkoxy
C–O stretching and epoxy C–O–C stretching vibrations),
1723 cm–1 (C=O stretching vibrations of COOH
groups), 3450 and 1610 cm–1 (stretching vibrations
of hydrogen-bonded-OH group and adsorbed water), and 1604 cm–1 (stretching vibrations of the sp2-hybridized C=C
bond in phenolic group).39 By contrast,
the IR spectra of modified GO (Figure 1b) show a reduction in the intensity of peaks assigned
to the epoxy C–O–C stretching vibration in parallel
with the appearance of new peaks at ca. 1100 and 2978 cm–1. These can be assigned to the C–N stretching vibration and
to the C–H stretching vibration in alkyl groups, respectively,
which may suggest that amine reacts with the epoxy groups at the GO
surface by ring-opening reaction to generate C–N bonds. Additionally,
the modified GO spectrum shows the disappearance of the hydroxyl group
vibration at approximately 3450 cm–1, an intensity
reduction in the peak due to adsorbed water at 1600–1610 cm–1 and the appearance of an alkyl band (2978 cm–1). All these features suggest that silane grafting
occurs at the GO surface.

(b) modified (silylated)
GO (GOmod).

Raman spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools to characterize
the structure, bonding, level of disorder, and composition of carbon-based
materials.40Figure 2 depicts the Raman spectra of GO, SnSe, SnSe/GO,
and SnSe/GOmod. The Raman spectra of GO (Figure 2a) show two prominent peaks
at ca. 1348 and 1597 cm–1. The G band (1597 cm–1) belongs to the stretching of the C–C bond
in graphitic materials and is common to all sp2 carbon
systems. Meanwhile, the D band (1348 cm–1) is associated
with the disordered structure of GO or structural defects.41 The Raman spectra of pristine SnSe (Figure 2b) show a peak at
150–170 cm–1, which originates from the Ag1 vibration mode characteristic of the orthorhombic phase
of SnSe.42 The relative intensity of the
D band is larger than that of the G band in the SnSe/GOmod (Figure 2d, ID/IG = 1.07) nanocomposite
as compared to GO itself (Figure 2a) as a consequence of the structural disorder induced
by the modification of the GO. The higher intensity of the D-band
can also be attributed to the alkyl groups which are anchored to the
GO surface as the result of the silylation process (as manifested
by C–H bands in the IR spectra; Figure 1b). Also, notable in the spectra is the presence
of the 2D band at ca. 2700 cm–1 (Figure 2a,d) that signifies the multilayer
nature of the GO material, while the peak at ca. 2940 cm–1 (Figure 2a,d) can
be assigned to the combination mode of G and D bands (D + G band).43,44 By comparison, considering the main features of the unmodified nanocomposite
(SnSe/Ge; Figure 2d),
the intensity of the D band (at 1348 cm–1) is relatively
only slightly higher than that of the G band (at 1597 cm–1) (ID/IG =
1.03) but nonetheless indicates increased formation of structural
defects compared to GO itself. The A1g vibration band with
a relatively weak intensity at 150–170 cm–1 from SnSe is observed as might be expected in the spectra of both
nanocomposites (Figure 2c,d).

Figure 2 Raman spectra of (a) neat GO, (b) neat SnSe, (c) SnSe/GO nanocomposite,
and (d) SnSe/GOmod.

Figure 3 depicts
XRD patterns of the components GO and SnSe and of the composites SnSe/GO
and SnSe/GOmod. The XRD pattern of GO contains one peak
at 10.5°, which can be assigned to the (001) reflection with
a corresponding interlayer distance of 0.84 nm (Figure 3a). The relatively simple pattern is characteristic
of GO and is consistent with a well-ordered GO structure that is sustained
by the presence of water and different oxygen-containing functional
groups,45 such as those identified in the
IR data presented above. The XRD pattern of pristine SnSe (Figure 3b) indicates the
presence of the expected peaks corresponding to the most prominent
reflections of the orthorhombic phase of SnSe. The diffraction pattern
of the SnSe nanoparticles could be matched well to JCPDS-ICCD, card
no. 32-1382, and all reflections could be indexed to the orthorhombic
phase of SnSe.46−48 No peaks indicative of Se, SnO2, SnSe2, or any other impurities were present, and the SnSe samples
were thus single-phase. The SnSe/GO and SnSe/GOmod nanocomposites
(Figure 3c,d and S1) exhibit similar XRD patterns dominated by
the SnSe phase reflections, with the notable observation that the
peaks are considerably broader than those from the pristine sample
of SnSe. The broadening of these reflections in the patterns of both
nanocomposites likely reflects a reduction in the particle size compared
to SnSe itself and indeed electron microscopy (HRTEM and SEM) corroborates
this assumption and is discussed in more detail below.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of (a) neat
GO; (b) SnSe; (c) SnSe/GO, and (d) SnSe/GOmod (reflections
marked with an asterisk and a dot correspond
to those of SnSe and GO, respectively).

Figure 4 shows
SEM
images of pristine SnSe and of both nanocomposites (SnSe/GO and SnSe/GOmod). Treatment of the SEM image (Figure 4c–e) using the ImageJ software with
the Granulometry Plugin (based on grey level mathematical morphology
operations)49 allows us to calculate the
size distribution of the primary particles and their aggregates for
each of the samples presented. SnSe itself (Figures 4c,f and S2 in the Supporting Information) is seen to be composed of approximately regular
nanospheres with diameters in the range of 7–35 nm and that
assemble into larger loose agglomerates. The morphology of the pristine
ice-templated GO is entirely different, and SEM images of the individual
beads and their cross-sections indicate the distinctive porous structure
with typical pore diameters of ca. 2–10 μm (Figure S3). By comparison, lower magnification
SEM images of both nanocomposites (Figures 4a,b, S4 and S5) indicate a mixing of sections of GO sheets with the SnSe nanoparticles
creating a more porous microstructure than for SnSe itself (Figure 4c) but lacking the
ordered macroporosity of pristine ice-templated GO (Figure S3). Looking at higher magnification (Figure 4d,e), the nanosphere-like morphology
of SnSe itself is retained in the synthesized nanocomposites. The
nanocomposite samples synthesized using unmodified GO (Figure 4d,g) were shown to form beads
with diameters in a range that are slightly smaller (7–32 nm)
than SnSe itself (Figure 4c,f). By contrast, the nanocomposites prepared using modified
GO (Figure 4e,h) consist
mostly of smaller nanoparticles dominated by those of a mean diameter
of ca. 5 nm and to a lesser extent to particles 20 nm across. One
would assume that the reduced nanoparticle size that predominates
in the modified GO nanocomposites is a direct consequence of the GO
surface modification, where the modifying agent that anchors to the
GO surface likely acts in a similar fashion to a surfactant. In this
case, the grafted silane chains can prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles
by steric repulsion, thus hindering any further growth of the composite
particles. The decrease in the GOmod particle size could
be a promising development toward reducing the thermal conductivity
via shortening the phonon mean free path and increasing the phonon
scattering at the grain boundaries.50−54 The high porosity indicated by the SEM images is
also potentially beneficial as a means to increase phonon scattering
centers as exemplified in systems such as Bi2Te3–PbTe where the porous microstructure exerts a significant
positive influence on both the thermal conductivity and the value
of the Seebeck coefficient; careful control of these structural features
can be exploited to improve the energy conversion efficiency of devices
employing such materials.

TEM images and SAED patterns of
neat SnSe and both nanocomposites
are shown in Figure 5. The lattice fringes for neat SnSe can be clearly seen in HRTEM
images (Figure 5d).
Correspondingly, the measured interplanar distances d for various sets of lattice planes closely match with the expected
planar separations for indexed planes from the orthorhombic phase
of SnSe and SAED patterns could be successfully indexed on this basis
(Figure 5g). For example,
lattice spacings of 2.95 Å (d(111)) and 3.55 Å (d(201)) were typically
observed in HRTEM images (Figure 5d). The diameter of the approximately spherical nanoparticles
in the neat SnSe material was determined to be ca. 20–40 nm,
which is in close agreement to estimates made from SEM images. It
is observed from Figure 5b,c,e,f that the nanoparticles in the composites are typically a
factor of 2 or more smaller than those of SnSe, again corroborating
SEM results. It is difficult to discern separate (modified) GO sheets
in the TEM images of the composites, which suggests a complete mixing
of sheet fragments and SnSe. Both nanocomposites (Figure 5d,f) produce SAED patterns
that are similar to those of as-synthesized SnSe, demonstrating that
highly crystalline selenide particles are preserved within the nanocomposites;
indeed, the measured interplanar distances are in excellent agreement
with the expected d-spacings for orthorhombic SnSe.47,48 It is also possible to note that in addition to the sharp diffraction
spots associated with the orthorhombic SnSe phase, there are more
diffuse rings which suggest the presence of (modified) GO, likely
coating the SnSe particles. This is persuasive evidence that the (modified)
GO has a role in preventing the agglomeration/growth of the SnSe particles
(cf. Figure 5a).

Given that previous evidence has suggested that powders of
SnSe
lose mass above 600 K, thermal and electrical data were measured over
a range from 290–540 K where the material is thermally stable.19 As can be seen from Figure 6a, the electrical conductivity σ of
the SnSe/GOmod nanocomposite increases from 708 S·m–1 at 290 K to 1257 S·m–1 at
539 K. It is especially notable that the values of the electrical
conductivity obtained for the modified SnSe/GOmod nanocomposite
are greater than those for both the unmodified SnSe/GO nanocomposite
(increasing from 443 S·m–1 at 290 K to 999
S·m–1 at 539 K) and SnSe itself (conductivity
increasing from ca. 55 S·m–1 at 290 K to only
250 S·m–1 at 539 K) over the same temperature
range (Figure 6a),
although the unmodified nanocomposites still compare well with some
of the best previously reported SnSe nanomaterials.55 Therefore, the effect of the GO component in the composites
has some significance. That the conductivity of the unmodified composite
is as high as observed is perhaps quite surprising given the electrically
insulating nature of GO.56 Less surprising
perhaps is the fact that once many of the oxygen-containing functionalities
have been removed by modification, the conductivity increases. In
the context of electrical conductivity, the modified GO behaves more
like reduced GO, graphene or indeed, “graphitic carbon nitride,
g-C3N4” as a component in the modified
composites.25 (Interestingly there is evidence
of C–N bonding by FTIR spectroscopy, as seen in Figure 1).

Figure 6 (a) Electrical conductivity,
(b) the Seebeck coefficient, and (c)
the power factor of neat SnSe, ice-templated SnSe/GOmod, and SnSe/GO nanocomposites.

The contrast in the variation in the Seebeck coefficient S with temperature for each of the nanocomposites is stark
(Figure 6b). S for SnSe/GO increases with temperature, showing the n-type
behavior at room temperature and transforming to p-type behavior at
402 K with S ≈ 31 μV·K–1 at 539 K. By comparison, S for SnSe/GOmod has a negative sign—showing n-type behavior—across
the entire measured temperature range and changes monotonically from
−102 μV·K–1 at room temperature
to −136 μV·K–1 at 539 K. Such
behavior indicates that the majority charge carriers are electrons
in both nanocomposites SnSe/GO and SnSe/GOmod. A comparison
with the temperature-dependent behavior of S for
SnSe itself, meanwhile, shows that the selenide itself exhibits n-type
behavior at room temperature with a value of the coefficient that
increases (becomes less negative) with increasing temperature, approaching
a transition to p-type behavior at 539 K (S ≈
−46 μV·K–1). Given that n-type
semiconductivity has been previously observed in SnSe nanoparticles
prepared from hydrated SnCl2,55 it would not be surprising if low levels of Cl– doping contributed to the negative Seebeck coefficients in both
SnSe itself and the nanocomposites in our measurements. The notable
difference in the magnitude of the coefficient in the modified SnSe/GOmod materials (and that the value remains negative with temperature,
indeed becoming more negative as T increases), however,
suggests an alternative (additional) source of electron doping, and
this is consistent with the N-doping in the modified GO component
(as indicated by spectroscopic data). Hence, the treatment with ODTS
and TEA both increases the electrical conductivity and switches the
semiconducting behavior from p-type (as observed in the majority of
SnSe materials and at high T for the GO nanocomposite here) to n-type.

Taking the above electrical data and Seebeck values of neat SnSe
and both nanocomposites, it was possible to derive values for the
power factor, S2σ, as a function
of temperature (Figure 6c). A combination of high electrical conductivity coupled with substantial
(negative) values of the Seebeck coefficient, S,
explains the significant difference in S2σ for neat SnSe and unmodified composite as compared with modified
one. The most important finding concerning the power factors of the
two different types of nanocomposite and neat SnSe is that S2σ for SnSe/GOmod is more than
an order of magnitude (20-fold) higher than that for SnSe/GO nanocomposites
and neat SnSe, at 539 K. The difference in power factor accomplished
by the modification of the GO component is especially striking given
that only 10 wt % of (modified) GO is used in the nanocomposites,
and the effect is very similar to that engendered by doping SnSe with
either iodine (S2σ of ≈0.016
mW m–1 K–2 at 565 K)6 or chlorine (S2σ
of ≈0.068 mW m–1 K–2 at
530 K).55 It remains to be seen in future
work as to what constitutes an optimum level of modified GO component
for a high-performance SnSe/GOmod nanocomposite (or indeed
whether alternative forms of functionalizing the GO can improve the
transport properties still further). However, ultimately, it should
prove beneficial to be able to replace at least some of the relatively
expensive and environmentally detrimental raw materials (namely, tin,
selenium, and halide additives where applicable) with ubiquitous carbon,
nitrogen, and silicon. Coupled with the energy-efficient, aqueous
solution synthesis approach used to prepare the SnSe component, there
are thus several ways in which the introduction of SnSe-based materials
could be made more sustainable.

Another obviously important
criterion in assessing the effectiveness
of a modified-GO composite approach to SnSe material development is
an evaluation of the thermal transport behavior. At the present time,
we have conducted preliminary thermal diffusivity measurements on
hot pressed samples, given the challenges in accounting for the porosity
of such materials and in representing their true experimental densities.
By approximating the composite density as the sum of the components
and making corrections for porosity,57 we
calculated the thermal conductivity (Figure S6) of the nanocomposites. It is perhaps not surprising that the total
thermal conductivity of the unmodified SnSe/GO composite is lower
than that of the modified material (by a factor of approximately 2;
tentatively ca. 0.4 W m–1 K–1 vs
0.7 W m–1 K–1 at 550 K) given
the likely more electrically and thermally insulating nature of GO
compared to the SnSe/GOmod nanocomposite. Both nanocomposites
exhibit values of κtotal of the same order as “pristine”
solution-synthesized SnSe nanoparticles.58 With further attenuation of the porosity and manipulation of GO
functionalization/doping in association with advanced processing techniques
such as spark plasma sintering, it should be possible to engineer
nanocomposites with finely tuned electrical and thermal properties.

4 Conclusions
This work demonstrates that it is possible
to prepare ice-templated
tin selenide-GO nanocomposites via a simple aqueous solution process.
Moreover, it is possible to functionalize the GO component by way
of modifying its surface using alkylamines. This allows the facile
creation of both unmodified (SnSe/GO) and modified (SnSe/GOmod) composite materials for the first time. The chemical modification
of the GO surface with TEA and ODTS produces significant changes to
the electrical properties of the ensuing SnSe GO-based composites.
Markedly, the surface-modified nanocomposite, SnSe/GOmod, exhibited higher electrical conductivity and an increased negative
Seebeck coefficient. The superior electrical conductivity and Seebeck
coefficient give rise to S2σ values
that exceed those of typical as-prepared powders of SnSe. Further,
the power factor for the modified SnSe/GOmod composite
is 20 times that of the equivalent unmodified nanocomposite, SnSe/GO.
Overall, these results suggest that freeze-cast GO nanocomposites
formed with “active” thermoelectric components can provide
a very effective means of influencing the electrical properties. Preliminary
data suggest that thermal properties may be similarly tunable. The
GO component in these nanocomposites affords a further layer of property
and performance control via porosity and functionalization/modification
of the surface. The approach should be adaptable to other material
systems offering a new strategy for designing relatively inexpensive,
lightweight, and low-toxicity thermoelectric materials and devices.
