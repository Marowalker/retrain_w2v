Miniaturization of electronic devices
and systems enhances the
complexity of inbuilt circuitry, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic
interference (EMI). EMI is a serious cause of concern as it affects
the performance of a device, transmission channel, or system. In a
quest to find an effective solution to this problem, several materials,
apart from the conventional metals, such as carbon derivatives, have
been extensively explored recently. In addition to carbon derivatives,
hybrid structures such as core–shell, conjugated systems, etc.
have also been researched. However, semiconducting fillers have received
less attention, especially in this application. Hence, this review
article will primarily focus on the systematic understanding of the
use of semiconductor-based polymer nanocomposites and how the band
gap plays a crucial role in deciding the dielectric properties and
subsequently the electromagnetic absorption behavior for shielding
applications. Our primary aim is to highlight the mechanism of shielding
involved in such nanocomposites in addition to discussing the synthesis
and properties that lead to effective shielding. Such nanocomposites
containing semiconductors can pave the way for alternate materials
for EMI shielding applications that are lightweight, flexible, and
easy to integrate.

1 Introduction
The growing demand for
electronic and communication devices in
various sectors of military, industry, and commercial applications
has led to a new kind of challenge called electromagnetic (EM) pollution.
To combat this problem, the scientific and research community has
initiated the development of various materials for electromagnetic
interference (EMI) shielding applications, which range from metals
to polymer nanocomposites. Polymer nanocomposite-based shield materials
are advantageous over the conventional metal-based shield due to its
low density, corrosion resistivity, ease of processability, and other
applications. Once we step into the field of polymer nanocomposites,
it spans a vast range of materials starting from various conducting
and semiconducting fillers to a few insulating fillers. The conducting
fillers that are commercially used include metal nanoparticles, carbon-based
fillers such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon fibers (CFs),
etc.1 Mxene2 comprises a newer class of conducting filler being investigated
for EMI shielding. Mxenes are two-dimensional inorganic compounds,
consisting of few-atom-thick layers of transition metal carbides,
nitrides, or carbonitrides. The high conductivity of Mxenes has compelled
the researchers to explore it for applications in the EMI shielding
domain. There are several reviews explaining conducting fillers and
its commercial usage. Herein, we will focus on the semiconducting
fillers that are recently being explored among the research groups
working in this field. The main reason behind stepping from conducting
fillers toward semiconducting fillers is the various losses involved
during the interaction of EM waves with matter at the GHz frequency
range. The losses in this frequency range are not only attributed
to ohmic, conduction, or eddy current losses but also to polarization
losses, which might be a possible reason that compelled the scientific
community to investigate the semiconducting fillers. However, the
exact mechanism of shielding and various losses involved in the GHz
frequency range is not well-established and is still under investigation.
This review article will highlight the EMI shielding properties of
semiconducting filler-based polymer nanocomposites, and to the best
of our knowledge, no such review article has discussed this topic
in detail.

A semiconductor is a material whose electrical conductivity
value
falls between a conductor and an insulator. The conventional semiconductors
have a band gap between 1 and 1.5 eV, whereas wide band gap semiconductors
have a band gap between 2 and 4 eV. It is to be noted that the value
of the band gap of a material is dependent on particle size3 and also the phase of the material obtained.
In this review article, we will cover semiconducting filler-based
polymer nanocomposites with varying band gaps, as demonstrated in Table 1. The various fillers
in the table have been categorized as low, medium, and high band gap
semiconductors for convenience. However, a few of the fillers mentioned
in this list remain unexplored/less explored for EMI shielding applications.
The primary aim of this work is to include literature that deals with
a semiconducting filler in a polymer matrix, but due to lack of available
data, a few papers that compared the shielding effectiveness data
for the hybrid structures with control semiconducting fillers are
also included in this review article. Semiconducting fillers such
as BaTiO3 and ZnO are very well studied along with their
hybrid structures for EMI shielding applications, and hence only a
few representative papers have been highlighted here. In each subsection
of this article, composites with only a semiconducting filler will
be covered first, followed by composites with hybrid fillers. Moreover,
the focus of this work is also on the nonmagnetic semiconducting material
as the magnetic fillers have been explored for EMI shielding applications
in the recent past. It is also to be noted that this work focuses
on polymer nanocomposites, and hence, literature involving non-polymer-based
nanocomposites for EMI shielding applications are excluded, as is
evident from the title of this work.

2 Terminologies Used for EMI
Shielding Measurements
EM shielding is defined as the material’s
ability to attenuate
EM radiations, and it is expressed either in terms of total shielding
effectiveness (SET) or reflection loss/reflection coefficient
(RL/RC).

SET is defined as the logarithm of the ratio
of the
incident power (PI) to the transmitted
power (PT) and is calculated using eq 1. 1  where SEA, SER, and
SEMR refer to the shielding via absorption, reflection,
and multiple reflections, respectively.

SEA, SER, and SEMR can be represented
by eqs 2, 3, and 4 respectively. 2   3   4  where σ represents the total conductivity,
ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf), μr corresponds to the relative permeability of
the shield material, d is the thickness of the shield,
and ε0 represents the dielectric constant in free
space.

However, for magnetic metallic materials with dielectric
loss and
magnetic loss properties (ε and μ), shielding is generally
defined in terms of reflection loss or reflection coefficient (RL
or RC) and can usually can be evaluated by eq 5. So, a minimum RL signifies that the losses
are mainly via the absorption mechanism. 5  where Z0 is the
impedance of free space and Zin is the
input characteristic impedance and is defined as 6  where μr and εr are the relative permeability and relative
permittivity of
the shielding material, f is the frequency of incoming
EM wave, d is the thickness of the shield material,
and c is the velocity of light in a vacuum.

It is to be noted that few papers in the literature report the
EMI shielding performance in terms of shielding effectiveness (SET, SEA, SER), whereas others report it
in terms of reflection loss or reflection coefficient (RL or RC).
The correlation between SE and RL is difficult to obtain without the
values of the relevant input parameters (as per eqs 1–6). It would
have been easier to compare data if the results were expressed in
terms of either SE or RL; however, given that many papers did not
include both RL and shielding effectiveness data in the same paper,
we reported the available data as is.

3 Semiconducting
Filler-Based Polymer Nanocomposites
3.1 Composites
with Low Band Gap Fillers
3.1.1 MoS2-Based
Composites
Transition metal dichalcogenides are 2D layered
semiconductor materials
of the type MX2, with M as the transition metal (Mo, W,
etc.) and X as the chalcogen (S, Se, or Te). MoS2 is a
well-known dichalcogenide used in photonics, photovoltaics, microelectronics,
and hydrogen evolution applications. MoS2 is one of the
dichalcogenides gaining attention for EMI shielding applications.
Zhang et al.25 studied the MoS2/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) system for EMI shielding performance.
It is observed that the minimum RL value of MoS2/PVDF composites
with a filler loading of 25 wt % reached −26.11 dB at 11.36
GHz for a thickness of 2.5 mm. In the 18–40 GHz frequency range,
the minimum RL of −27.47 dB was observed at 18.47 GHz (for
30 wt % filler and 1.5 mm thickness) and of −32.67 dB was observed
at 28.93 GHz (20 wt % filler and 3.5 mm thickness). Also, they observed
that the MoS2 hierarchical nanostructure showed a minimum
RL value of −26.11 dB (at 11.36 GHz), which is much higher
than that of bulk MoS2/PVDF composites (−11.94 dB
at ∼5.9 GHz) and micrometer-sized MoS2/PVDF composites
(−12.27 dB at ∼13.5 GHz) for 25 wt % filler loading
and for a thickness of 2.5 mm. The authors claim that the microwave
absorption mechanisms include various polarization, destructive interference
theory, and multiple reflections. Menon et al.26 measured the EMI shielding behavior (shown in Figure 1) of MoS2, Fe3O4, Fe3O4@MoS2, multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and MWCNT/Fe3O4@MoS2 in a dopamine-functionalized polyurethane
(PU) matrix. The concentration of MWCNTs and other nanoparticles was
fixed at 3 and 5 wt %, respectively, and the composite sample was
made 5 mm thick. The total shielding effectiveness for 5 wt % MoS2 is observed to be −5.5 dB, 5 wt % Fe3O4 is −6.3 dB, and 5 wt % Fe3O4@MoS2 is −11.6 dB at 18 GHz frequency. However,
the total shielding effectiveness increases as frequency increases
for composite samples with MWCNTs. At 18 GHz, SET for a
composite with 3 wt % MWCNT is observed to be −23.6 dB, and
for the composite with 3 wt % MWCNT/5 wt % Fe3O4@MoS2, it is observed to be −36.6 dB. The authors
report shielding via absorption to be the primary cause of energy
dissipation. They have attributed it to multiple internal reflections
from MWCNTs, eddy current losses, interface polarization losses at
the heterogeneous interfaces, and polarization losses from defect
sites in the nanoparticles.

Wang et al.27 studied the hybrids of
MoS2 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on microwave absorption
performance. Both rGO and MoS2 are semiconducting; however,
the degree of reduction decides the band gap of rGO. With 10 wt %
loading of the MoS2/rGO in a wax matrix and for a sample
thickness of 2.3 mm, the minimum RL of −50.9 dB was observed
at 11.68 GHz frequency. They claimed that the microwave absorption
is a result of three different mechanisms (shown in Figure 2): (a) the defect polarization
of MoS2 nanocrystals, (b) the defect polarization of the
oxygen-containing groups and the imperfect carbon structures in rGO,
and (c) the multiple interfacial polarization in MoS2/rGO
hybrids. Ding et al.28 synthesized rGO-MoS2 via hydrothermal synthesis and incorporated it in the paraffin
matrix. They measured the EMI shielding performance of the composite
and further compared it with pure MoS2 and a pure rGO-based
composite. With 10 wt % filler loading of rGO-MoS2, the
minimum RL value obtained was −41.53 dB at 11.36 GHz with a
thickness of 3.0 mm. The proposed mechanism of shielding was similar
to that mentioned by Wang et al.27 Ran
et al.29 synthesized 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane
(KH570)-modified MoS2 (M/MoS2) and prepared
a composite of the (M/MoS2)/rGO nanosheet by embedding
it in a PVP matrix. For a thickness of 3 mm, they obtained a minimum
RL of −49.7 dB at 13.68 GHz with 18 wt % (M/MoS2)/rGO. They have attributed the microwave absorption behavior to
the defect dipole polarization as well as the multiple interfacial
polarization.

3.1.2 MnO2-Based Composites
Zhou et al.30 synthesized hollow urchin-like
α-MnO2 nanostructures and studied the microwave absorption
properties of α-MnO2 nanostructures by mixing it
with paraffin wax in a mass ratio of 1:1. The minimum RL of −41
dB was obtained at 8.7 GHz with a thickness of 1.9 mm. It is to be
noted that, in general, MnO2 nanostructures are antiferromagnetic
materials, which implies that the magnetic loss is negligibly small
and dielectric loss dominates the loss mechanism. The sample that
exhibited minimum RL of −41 dB has lower tan δε but higher tan δμ as compared to the sample
in which MnO2 was prepared under different experimental
conditions. They further support their result by stating that it has
been well-established in the literature that magnetic behavior can
be disturbed by the dielectric behavior at a microwave frequency.
Even with comparatively low tan δε compared
to that of the other sample, it has proved to be a better EM shield,
and thus they claim that both dielectric and magnetic losses play
a crucial role in this scenario. Moreover, they suggest that the microcircuit
model explains the dielectric loss due to the inner walls of the urchin-like
nanostructures, which can be considered as microloops, whereas actinomorphic
one-dimensional MnO2 can be considered as several antennas
that convert electromagnetic waves into a vibrating microcurrent.
This microcurrent can be produced in the microloops, leading to dielectric
resonant peaks. Bora et al.31 synthesized
a PANI-α-MnO2 nanorod composite and investigated
the EMI shielding performance. With a thickness of 169 ± 2 μm,
the composite showed most effective EMI SET of approximately
−35 dB (EMI shielding due to absorption, SEA ∼
−24 dB and EMI shielding due to reflection SER ∼
−11 dB) in the X-band, whereas SET was found to
be approximately −39 dB (SEA ∼ −29
dB and SER ∼ −10 dB) in the Ku-band. It is
to be noted that α-MnO2 is reported to be a better
microwave absorber compared to other crystalline states. The EM shielding
property of PANI-MnO2 is attributed to the high dielectric
loss incurred due to presence of MnO2 and high electrical
loss (dissipation current) that takes place along the PANI-grafted
MnO2 nanorods.

3.1.3 CdSe-Based Composites
Cao et al.32 reported a ligand-assisted
solvothermal synthesis
of CdSe hollow nanostructures (70 wt %) and incorporated it in paraffin
for EMI shielding applications. They also compared it with solid CdSe
nanoparticles (70 wt %) in the paraffin matrix. It is observed that
with 3 mm thickness and at 11.7 GHz frequency, minimum RL is −14
dB for CdSe hollow nanostructures, whereas the reflection loss for
the solid CdSe nanostructures is more than −3 dB for frequencies
above ∼11–18 GHz. For 4 mm thickness, two minima are
observed in the value of RL (−16 dB at 5.6 GHz and −31
dB at 17.8 GHz). The authors claim that this difference in RL between
the hollow and solid CdSe nanostructures has a size dependence. They
explain that the size of the building blocks of CdSe nanostructures
(small or large) decides the properties of the nanostructure, which
further has its role in shielding. Moreover, both the real and imaginary
parts of the relative permittivity for the hollow sample are higher
than those for the solid one. This also indicates that the hollow
CdSe nanostructures have an electrical conductivity higher than that
of the solid ones, enhancing the microwave absorption properties.

3.2 Composites with Medium Band Gap Fillers
3.2.1 CuS-Based Composites
He et al.33 synthesized CuS nanostructures by varying the
ratio of the precursors and observed that change in nanostructure
resulted in the change in EMI shielding performance. For a shield
thickness of 3.5 mm and CuS loading of 20 wt %, the minimum RL value
for the CuS–paraffin composite is observed to be −76.4
dB at 12.64 GHz. The authors attribute the microwave absorption behavior
to the CuS dielectric losses and interfacial polarization due to the
heterogeneous structure of the composite. The flower-like CuS with
a band gap of 1.45 eV was prepared by Hu et al.34 using solvothermal synthesis. They prepared the EMI shielding
samples by blending CuS with waterborne polyacrylate emulsion along
with thickening agent and deionized water. Finally, this mixture was
coated on a circular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) plate to obtain
a 0.6 mm thick EMI sample. SET was observed to be between
−27 and −31 dB with CuS content as 28.6 wt % in the
frequency of 300 kHz to 3 GHz. In another work by Hu et al.,35 they explored PANI/flower-like CuS for EMI shielding
performance. Compared to the original CuS and pure PANI, PANI/flower-like
CuS composites exhibited enhanced SET. The EMI shielding
was measured after incorporating PANI/CuS in the paraffin matrix.
The optimal EMI SET of the PANI–CuS (50 wt % CuS)
composites in paraffin reached −45.2 dB at 2.78 GHz for 3 mm
thickness. It is to be noted here that the authors first prepared
the PANI/CuS composite (20 wt %) and mixed it in the paraffin matrix.
Also, an improved shielding efficiency (or shielding effectiveness)
below −18 dB was obtained over the entire frequency range from
300 kHz to 3 GHz. The authors explained that the mobile charge carriers
in CuS interacted with the electromagnetic fields. However, the enhanced
EMI SET of the PANI–CuS composites is mainly attributed
to the coordination bonding and the strong π–π
interactions between PANI and CuS. This may be useful for the charge
transfer at the newly formed interface of PANI and CuS. Another reason
that contributes to the SET is the flower-like structure
CuS–PANI composites resulting in multiple scattering or reflections
of incident EM radiations. Liu et al.36 investigated CuS nanoflakes which were vertically aligned on magnetically
decorated (NiFe2O4) graphene for EMI shielding
performance. With 20 wt % magnetically decorated graphene/CuS in paraffin
and for a thickness of 2.5 mm, the minimum RL was obtained to be −54.5
dB at 11.4 GHz frequency. CuS powder being a low band gap semiconductor
is often used as an additive coating on the polymer surface to increase
its conductivity. The author explains the mechanism of shielding by
citing the free-electron theory. It says that an increase in conductivity
of a composite could result in strong dielectric loss, and hence,
they concluded that magnetically decorated graphene@CuS shows a stronger
dielectric loss. They further explain that the magnetic loss is probably
caused by natural resonance and an eddy current effect. While delving
deeper into the mechanism, they add that CuS nanoflakes can also act
as a microwave receiver, as the EM waves can get trapped in the inner
voids and can lead to multiple reflections and scattering. They also
suggest that the addition of magnetic particles in graphene sheets@CuS
increases the microwave absorption properties due to better impedance
matching, interfacial polarization, dipole polarization, and ion polarization.
Also, the residual defects and groups in graphene sheets tend to introduce
defect polarization relaxation, electron polarization, and relaxation
processes that favor microwave absorption.

3.2.2 CoO-Based
Composites
Sun et al.37 studied
the microwave absorption properties
of CoO nanobelts and sub-micrometer CoO spheres. It was observed that
the CoO nanobelts showed a strong broad peak at 14.2 GHz with a minimum
RL of −12.3 dB, whereas the minimum RL reached −8.7
dB at 14.4 GHz for sub-micrometer spheres of CoO. It is to be noted
that CoO nanostructures (70 wt %) were uniformly mixed in the paraffin
matrix, and a shield of thickness 3 mm was obtained. CoO nanostructures
are antiferromagnetic material, and thus there is negligible magnetic
loss contribution. The major contribution to the microwave absorption
is primarily due to the dielectric loss rather than the magnetic loss.
The dielectric loss is known to originate from electronic polarization,
ion polarization, and intrinsic electric dipole polarization, but
it is the frequency range that decides which polarization is the dominant
cause of the loss. The material crystal structure, size, and shape
of nanomaterials influence the shielding properties as was observed
in this paper,37 where the change in the
shape of CoO resulted in a change in shielding properties. From the
electron microscopy characterization results, the authors concluded
that the microwave-absorbing performance is associated with the single-crystal
structure, the crystallization, and the aggregation degree of the
nanocrystal building blocks.

3.2.3 WS2-Based Composites
Zhang et al.38 explored the microwave
absorption property of WS2-based composites. They synthesized
WS2–rGO by varying the mass ratios of GO (3, 4,
5, and 6%) and denoted the samples as S3, S4, S5, and S6. These samples
were incorporated in 60% wax, and a shield with a thickness of ∼1.5
mm was prepared. SET of over −20 dB is obtained
in the frequency range of 2–18 GHz, with a minimum of −32
dB for sample S5. The EMI shielding mechanism for WS2–rGO
architecture is explained in Figure 3. The dielectric loss and abundant multiscattering
are the dominant reasons for energy dissipation. The dielectric loss
comprises the conduction loss and relaxation loss. The difference
in surface conductance between WS2 and rGO results in an
additional loss via the interfacial polarization which can be modeled
as a capacitor. The literature for WS2 is very limited,
and dichalcogenides still remain an unexplored area for EMI shielding
applications.

3.2.4 CdS-Based Composites
Lu et al.39 studied the temperature-dependent microwave
absorption properties of the CdS-MWCNT-based composite. They fabricated
three kinds of structures, namely, MWCNTs coated with CdS nanocrystals
(CdS-MWCNTs), coated with a thin CdS sheath (S-MWCNTs), and coated
with a thick CdS sheath (TS-MWCNTs). For room-temperature tests, paraffin
wax served the purpose of the matrix. The minimum RL of the wax matrix
composite loading with CdS-MWCNTs is observed to be −25 dB
(10 wt % filler loading and 3.5 mm thickness), which is 2.5 times
higher than S-MWCNTs and 12 times higher than TS-MWCNTs. They attribute
the strong absorption ability to the effective impedance matching
in CdS-MWCNTs and dielectric loss. As per the Debye theory, ε″
denotes the dielectric loss, which comprises both polarizations and
electrical conductivity originating from CdS-MWCNTs. The polarizations
include the interfacial polarization due to abundant interfaces between
CdS nanocrystals and MWCNTs and the dipolar polarization caused by
surface functional groups, defects on/in acid-treated MWCNTs. Moreover,
high aspect ratio and conductivity of MWCNTs and CdS-MWCNTs can build
a conductive network in the composite for electron hopping and migration.
In the case of S-MWCNTs and TS-MWCNTs, the CdS sheaths hinder the
electron transfer between MWCNTs in the conductive network, which
further decreases the dielectric loss.

3.2.5 WO3-Based Composites
Sastry et al.40 carried out an in situ
polymerization of aniline monomer with camphor sulfonic acid (CSA)
as dopant and ammonium persulfate as an oxidizing agent. They synthesized
PANI-CSA tungsten oxide composites (PANI/CSA-WO3) with
a chemical oxidation method. With 40 wt % filler content, the obtained
SET ∼ −13.8 dB at 14.2 GHz frequency. They
claim that WO3 acts as a lossy dielectric filler between
the PANI/CSA chains, resulting in effective EM attenuation. Boujar
Dolabi et al.41 synthesized WO3/MnFe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs core, 50/50 wt
%) and via in situ polymerization obtained a core–shell structure
of a WO3/MnFe2O3/PANI nanocomposite
(50 wt % as the core). With a thickness of 1.5 mm, a minimum RL of
−12 dB was observed at 8.8 and 11.6 GHz. They attribute the
shielding to the dielectric and magnetic losses. They further claim
that the interfacial losses due to the changing boundary condition
at various interfaces also contributes to the loss mechanism. Wang
et al.42 synthesized the hierarchical structure
of graphene@Fe3O4@PANI@WO3 (graphene@Fe3O4/WO3 mass ratio = 2:1) and studied
its microwave-absorbing performance after incorporating it in paraffin
wax (70 wt % nanostructure). The EM wave absorption studies show that
graphene@Fe3O4@PANI@WO3 exhibits
high EM wave absorption properties, with a minimum RL of −46.7
dB at 9.3 GHz for a thickness of 4 mm, which is higher than that of
graphene@Fe3O4 (minimum RL = −15.4 dB
at 14.1 GHz for a thickness of 1.5 mm) and graphene@Fe3O4@PANI (minimum RL = −20.9 dB at 9.4 GHz with
a coating of 4 mm). The enhanced EM wave absorption mechanism of graphene@Fe3O4@PANI@WO3 is ascribed to the improved
impedance matching, enhanced interfacial polarization, and multiple
scattering. Moreover, the presence of the PANI layer on the graphene
sheet can lead to electron tunneling and enhanced electronic clouds,
converting EM energy into heat. Herein, WO3 particles in
the hierarchical structure were designed to decrease permittivity,
leading to an improvement in impedance matching.

3.3 Composites with High Band Gap Fillers
3.3.1 MoO3-Based Composites
Lyu et al.43 synthesized MoO3/Mo4O11/MoO2 heterogeneous nanobelts
(60 wt %) and incorporated them into the paraffin matrix. It showed
a minimum RL of −59.2 dB at 10.8 GHz with a thickness of 4.6
mm. The EM absorption studies show that the high dielectric loss and
enhancement in impedance matching due to the heterogeneous structure
contribute to enhanced shielding. The heterogeneous interface leads
to a formation of microcapacitance and leads to enhancement in multiple
scattering. Li et al.44 synthesized 1D
MoS2/MoO3 hybrids and incorporated them in the
PVDF matrix. With a filler loading of 20 wt %, the minimum RL is found
to be −38.5 dB at 8.7 GHz with a thickness of 1.9 mm. They
attribute the shielding performance primarily to the dielectric losses.
The uneven distribution of space charges between MoO3 cores
and MoS2 shells leads to interfacial polarization, and
the defects and residual groups in the low-crystalline MoS2 shells can accumulate enough bound charges (dipoles) to generate
considerable orientation polarization.

3.3.2 BaTiO3-Based Composites
Zhu et al.45 synthesized BaTiO3 nanotubes via a wet chemical route.
The dielectric loss at a lower
frequency range (shown in Figure 4) is explained by the leak conductance, whereas relaxation
polarization and electric conductance become dominant at a higher
frequency range. The overall loss mechanisms in dielectric BaTiO3 can be explained by dielectric polarization, spontaneous
polarization, and the associated relaxation phenomena. Here, it becomes
important to understand the difference between dielectric polarization
and spontaneous polarization (a characteristic of ferroelectric material).
Dipolar/dielectric polarization arises from molecules with a permanent
electric dipole moment that can change orientation in an applied electric
field. If a molecule of a substance has a permanent dipole moment,
that is, they have a moment even in the absence of an electric field,
it is called dipolar molecule and substances containing such molecules
are called dipolar substance (for example, H2O). It is
to be noted that though the individual molecules in a dipolar substance
have a permanent dipole moment, the net polarization disappears in
the absence of an external electric field because the molecular moments
are randomly oriented, resulting in complete cancellation of the polarization.
However, BaTiO3 is a ferroelectric crystal (a special class
of dielectric material), and ferroelectrics exhibit an electric dipole
moment even in the absence of an external electric field. Ferroelectrics
generally consist of regions called domains. Within each of these
domains, the polarization is in the same direction, but in adjacent
domains, the polarization is in different directions. The net polarization
depends on the difference in the volumes of the upward- and downward-directed
domains. In the ferroelectric state, the center of the positive charge
of the crystal does not coincide with the center of negative charge.
They exhibit a spontaneous nonzero polarization even when the applied
electric field is zero. This spontaneous polarization can be reversed
by a strong applied electric field in the opposite direction. The
polarization is therefore dependent not only on the current electric
field but also on its history, yielding a hysteresis loop. It is worthwhile
to note that crystal in a normal dielectric state usually does not
show significant hysteresis with the electric field, but ferroelectrics
do exhibit hysteresis. Ferroelectricity usually disappears above a
certain temperature called the transition temperature.

The paper also shows the plots of μ′
and μ″
(Figure 4c,d), which
exhibits a resonance peak which may be related to natural resonance.
However, as these values are higher than the ones reported in the
literature, there could be a possibility of instrument error. In addition
to this, the high interfacial area and hollow structure of nanotubes
resulted in the minimum RL of −21.8 dB for BaTiO3 nanotubes/paraffin wax composite at 15 GHz for a shield thickness
of 2 mm and weight fraction of 70% (Figure 4e). Chauhan et al.46 measured the EMI shielding performance of BaTiO3-filled
polyetherketone (PEK) composites in the X-band. Total shielding effectiveness
of −11 dB (∼92% attenuation) is observed for a shield
thickness of 2 mm and filler content of 18 vol %. As the dielectric
loss due to BaTiO3 is the major cause of EM attenuation,
the author attributes the loss to the polarization effect. Abbas et
al.47 studied the complex permittivity
and RL of BaTiO3/polyaniline in the polyurethane matrix
for X-band frequencies. Composite samples were prepared by dispersing
BaTiO3/PANI particulates in a two-pack polyurethane matrix
that consisted of polyol-8 and hexamethylene diisocyanate mixed in
50:50 ratios. A minimum RL of −15 dB was observed for a sample
(BaTiO3/polyaniline = 1:3) with a thickness of less than
3.0 mm at 10 GHz frequency. BaTiO3 is a ferroelectric material
exhibiting high resistivity. Ba2+ and O2– ions form a face-centered cubic lattice, with Ti4+ ions
fitting in the octahedral interstices. At room temperature, the Ti4+ ions are possibly at minimum energy, which is off-centered
and thus gives rise to permanent electric dipoles. When protonated
by HCl acid solution, polyaniline also possesses permanent electric
dipoles. Thus, dipolar polarization becomes one of the contributing
factors in the loss mechanisms, owing to the dielectric nature of
filler and matrix. Joule heating due to inherent conductivity of the
polyaniline adds to the loss mechanism. Interfacial polarization is
also expected due the heterogeneous structure of the composite.

Guo et al.48 also studied the BaTiO3-based composite for EMI shielding applications. The composite
with 15 wt % rGO@BaTiO3 in the PVDF matrix showed the minimum
RC of −45.3 dB at 5.44 GHz for a thickness of 4.5 mm. They
also calculated the SET and found that 30 wt % filler demonstrates
a minimum SET of up to −9.8 dB in the frequency
range of 2–14 GHz.

3.3.3 TiO2- and
ZnO-Based Composites
Zhuo et al.49 synthesized dendritic
nanostructures by a two-step chemical vapor deposition process and
compared the results of dielectric and microwave shielding properties
with ZnO nanowires. Figure 5 shows the complex permittivity and RL plot of the primary
ZnO nanowires composite versus the ZnO dendritic nanostructured composite.
The filler content was 50 vol % in a paraffin matrix. The real permittivity
of the ZnO nanowire composite is observed to be nearly 5.0, and the
imaginary permittivity is about 1.0. However, the real part of relative
permittivity showed a decrease from 30 to 15 as the frequency increases
for ZnO dendritic nanostructures. It exhibits a peak in the frequency
range of 13–17 GHz. The imaginary part of permittivity shows
an increase from 4 to 7, and the curve exhibits two broad peaks in
the frequency range of 0.1–13 and 13–17 GHz. This resonance
behavior is expected for a highly conductive composite with significant
skin effect. The response of ZnO nanostructures can be attributed
to the electronic spin and charge polarization due to polarized centers.
The value of the minimum RL for the ZnO dendritic nanostructure composite
is −42 dB at 3.6 GHz with a thickness of 5.0 mm. Excellent
dielectric and microwave shielding properties are observed for complicated
interfaces of ZnO dendritic nanostructures compared to nanowires,
and thus it can be concluded that morphology has a significant role
in microwave absorption.

Singh et al.50 studied the EMI shielding
behavior of nanocomposites based on transition metal oxides in poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA). They studied different transition metal oxides such
as Fe2O3, ZnO, SiO2, ZrO2, and TiO2 incorporated in the PVA matrix in the frequency
range of 4–8 GHz (C-band) and 8–12 GHz (X-band). At
10 wt % concentration level and 0.5 mm thickness, the minimum
reflection loss values for the composites containing Fe2O3, ZnO, SiO2, ZrO2, and TiO2 were found to be −38.85 (10.4 GHz), −33.65
(10.4 GHz), −41.90 (10.4 GHz), −24.90 (11.0 GHz), and
−32.90 dB (9.76 GHz), respectively. PVA is not 100% transparent
to EM radiations, and thus it also shows a minimum reflection loss
of −21.50 dB at 10.4 GHz frequency. It is to be noted here
that Fe2O3, ZnO, and TiO2 are the
semiconducting oxides, whereas ZrO2 and SiO2 have a band gap greater than 5 eV. The authors have attributed the
losses in SiO2-, ZnO-, ZrO2-, and TiO2-based nanocomposites to be dielectric in nature, whereas they claim
that Fe2O3-based nanocomposites exhibit both
dielectric and magnetic losses.

Phang et al.51 synthesized hexanoic
acid (HA)-doped PANI nanocomposites containing TiO2. Pani/HA/TiO2 nanocomposite with the highest permittivity, heterogeneity,
and loss tangent showed a minimum RL of −31 dB at 10 GHz. Dhawan
et al.52 synthesized a conducting ferrimagnetic
polyaniline nanocomposite with γ-Fe2O3 (9–12 nm) and TiO2 (70–90 nm) nanoparticles.
A different formulation of polymer nanocomposite having an aniline/TiO2/γ-Fe2O3 weight ratio of 1:1:1
(PTF11) and 1:1:2 (PTF12) was chosen along with composite having aniline/TiO2 weight ratio of 1:1 and aniline/γ-Fe2O3 (PF12) weight ratio of 1:2 for comparison. The polyaniline–TiO2–γ-Fe2O3 nanocomposite
showed enhanced shielding effectiveness (SEA ∼ −45
dB) compared to that of polyaniline−γ-Fe2O3 (SEA ∼ −8.8 dB) and polyaniline–TiO2 (SEA ∼ −22.4 dB) nanocomposite for
the frequency range of 12.4–18 GHz (Ku-band). Losses due to
TiO2 is a result of its high dielectric constant along
with strong dipolar polarization and the associated relaxation phenomenon.
γ-Fe2O3 and TiO2 in the polyaniline
matrix leads to a significant increase in a real and imaginary part
of complex permittivity. It can be attributed to the interfacial polarization
due to the presence of insulating γ-Fe2O3 particles and high dielectric TiO2 particles. Absorption-based
EMI shielding is mainly attributed to the combined effect of magnetic
and dielectric losses incurred due to the incorporation of γ-Fe2O3 and TiO2. In another work by Akman
et al.,53 they exploited the combined effect
of BaFe12O19 and TiO2 on EMI shielding
performance. They varied the weight fractions of BaFe12O19/TiO2 weight fractions and compared the
nanocomposites with and without polypyrrole (Ppy) coating. The dielectric
loss saw a significant jump in the samples with Ppy coating in the
frequency range of 8–18 GHz. The sample having an equal amount
of magnetic and dielectric fillers and with Ppy coating showed a minimum
RL of −35 dB at 16.5 GHz. However, the minimum RL of −45
dB at 17.5 GHz was obtained for the sample with a higher amount of
magnetic filler and without Ppy coating.

Kong et al.54 gave a good insight into
the EM-absorbing material and its need to have a suitable permittivity
and dielectric loss value. With the increase in dielectric loss, the
absorption coefficient increases, but the problem arises because,
as the dielectric loss is enhanced, the permittivity also increases
and subsequently the EM reflection increases. This poses a problem
as the aim of a good shield is to enhance the EM absorption capabilities.
It is revealed that the materials having high EM absorption capability
require a low real part of permittivity and an appropriately high
electrical conductivity (around 1 S/m). Alternatively, when the permittivity
meets the EM impedance match requirement, higher dielectric loss implies
better EM absorption properties. It is to be noted that the electrical
conductivity is related to the imaginary part of permittivity (ε″)
according to eq 7. 7  Here, σ represents the electrical conductivity
(S/m), ε0 is the permittivity of free space, and f is the frequency (Hz). From the above description, it
is also evident that the value of 1 S/m required for good EM absorption
ability lies in the semiconducting range. Moreover, they have also
presented a chart, as shown in Figure 6, which relates the real and imaginary part of permittivity
with RC/RL (calculated from eq 5). The minimum value of RC is a function of frequency and
thickness (shown in Figure 6). The four-color lines in Figure 6 signify that the permittivity corresponding
to a minimum RC decreases with the increase of thickness and frequency.
The blue color line represents the minimum RC corresponding to 2 mm
thickness. It is observed that the complex permittivity of the minimum
RC is reduced from 20–5j to 10–3j when the frequency changes from 8.2 to 12.4 GHz. Orange,
yellow, and red lines represent thicknesses of 2.86, 4, and 5 mm,
respectively. Also, the paper claims that no material in literature
satisfies the condition of optimum combination of the real and imaginary
parts of permittivity to serve the dual purpose of RC and maximizing
effective absorption bandwidth. Hence, to improve absorption properties
and to obtain optimal permittivity, it is desired to design materials
with special composition and microstructure. In their work, they have
synthesized ZnO/ZnAl2O4 composite powders via
sol–gel synthesis. Sub-micrometer-sized ZnO acts as an electrically
lossy phase, and ZnAl2O4 nanograins act as a
medium permittivity phase. ZnO/ZnAl2O4 (40 wt
%), when incorporated in the paraffin matrix, exhibits appropriate
permittivity and electrical conductivity, which can be attributed
to the high carrier concentration and mobility at the interfaces.
For a sample thickness of 2.86 mm, the minimum RC reaches −25
dB (whole X-band) for the sample with ZnO/ZnAl2O4 in the molar ratio of 88.9:11.1.

permittivity and reflection
coefficient. Reprinted from re (54). Copyright 2013 American Chemical Society.

In another work by Song et al.,55 they
decorated ZnO particles on MWCNTs and incorporated them in wax. With
40 wt % ZnO/MWCNT content in the wax, the minimum RL was obtained
as −36 dB for a 5 mm thick shield between 5 and 6 GHz. They
described shielding behavior using a resistor–capacitor model.
They claim that the MWCNT/ZnO shows resonant absorption, which implies
two different types of RL peaks caused by the quarter-wavelength attenuation
and the MWCNT/ZnO interface. Han et al.56 studied C/ZnO nanoparticles mixed in paraffin wax for electromagnetic
shielding performance. With 40 wt % nanofillers, the composite shows
a minimum RC of −52 dB at 11 GHz with a sample thickness of
1.75 mm. Compared to pure carbon spheres and ZnO hollow spheres, the
core/shell structure of C/ZnO composites showed promising results
with high dielectric loss and moderate impedance match. In a work
by Wu et al.,57 they synthesized 3D rGO/ZnO
nanoparticles followed by subsequent UV irradiation to remove the
remnant oxygen functional groups from rGO. They incorporated these
nanoparticles in the paraffin matrix (10 wt %). It was observed that,
for a sample thickness of 3 mm, the minimum RL is −25.31 dB
at 11.52 GHz.

3.3.4 SrTiO3-Based
Composites
Murugan et al.58 hydrothermally
synthesized
cubic SrTiO3 nanoparticles and made them into a composite
with epoxy as a polymer matrix. With a filler content of 50 wt % and
a shield thickness of 1 mm, the composite exhibited a minimum RL of
−48 dB at 14.5 GHz frequency. SrTiO3 in an epoxy
matrix was also studied by Choi et al.59 It is observed that the minimum RL for a 5 mm thick composite with
0.6 volume fraction of SrTiO3 is −30 dB at 9 GHz,
and the composite containing a 0.3 volume fraction of SrTiO3 shows a minimum RL of −34 dB at 4.3 GHz. The authors have
plotted the complex permittivity and permeability with an increase
in frequency, and it is evident that the dielectric losses are one
of the dominant factors resulting in EMI shielding performance.

3.3.5 SnO2-Based Composites
Feng
et al.60 studied the effect of SnO2 nanowires (NWs) on the EMI shielding performance. The value
of minimum RL for the composites with 20 vol % SnO2 NWs
were found to be approximately −32.5 dB at 14 GHz with a thickness
of 5.0 mm. They observe that microwave absorption exhibited by the
composite is due to the dielectric loss rather than magnetic loss.
The authors propose that dipolar polarization and the associated relaxation
phenomena of SnO2 constitute the loss mechanisms. It has
been studied that composite materials, in which semiconductor NWs
are coated with a dielectric nanolayer, introduce additional interfaces
and more polarization charges at the surface. The interfacial polarization
and the associated relaxation in such cases add to the loss mechanism.
Further, they have suggested that the molecular dipoles formed at
the NWs’ surface interact with the microwave field, resulting
in some absorption losses through heating. Zhao et al.61 synthesized honeycomb-like SnO2 foams
via the polystyrene template method. The SnO2 foams were
uniformly blended with paraffin wax at 30% weight fraction, and EMI
shielding measurements were done for 2 mm thick samples. The minimum
RL is reported to be −37.6 dB at 17.1 GHz, with RL below −10
dB at 5.6 GHz (12.4–18.0 GHz). The enhanced microwave absorption
properties were ascribed to dipole polarization. The small SnO2 nanoparticles serve the purpose of dipoles in the SnO2 foam. Interfacial polarization, impedance match, multiple
reflection, and diffuse scattering further adds to the mechanism of
shielding. Liu et al.62 synthesized an
Fe3O4@SnO2 yolk–double-shelled
structure with a magnetic Fe3O4 core and a dielectric
SnO2 as a double shell. The composite samples were prepared
by mixing the Fe3O4@SnO2 and epoxy
resin in a mass ratio of 1:5. The RL for the double-shelled Fe3O4@SnO2 yolk–shell microspheres
reached a minimum of −36.5 dB at 7 GHz with a shield thickness
of 2 mm. The authors suggest that the shielding is due to the absorption
losses arising out of the interaction of EM waves with the shield
material. It is not only the dielectric losses due to SnO2 and the magnetic losses due to the Fe3O4 playing
role but also the synergistic effect of SnO2 and Fe3O4. The dielectric constant and loss increase due
to effective interfaces between the dielectric and magnetic materials,
thus resulting in loss via interfacial polarization. However, the
authors suggest that the void spaces and high porosity of the yolk–shell
microspheres might also act as active sites for internal scattering
of EM waves.

4 Summary of Semiconducting
Fillers Used in Polymeric
Shields
Table 2 discusses
the summary of the literature discussed in this article. It is quite
difficult to compare different semiconducting materials as the parameter
for measurement varies in each paper. So, we cannot exactly conclude
the role of the band gap of filler material for EMI shielding applications.
However, this table gives a preliminary idea as to how different semiconducting
fillers perform in the area of microwave absorption via dielectric,
interfacial, and scattering losses.

As most of the semiconducting
fillers stated above exhibit dielectric
losses as one of their primary mechanism of shielding, it is worthwhile
to study the relation between semiconducting nature and dielectric
behavior of a material. We carried out a literature survey to figure
out if there exists any relationship between the band gap and dielectric
properties. Yim et al.63 confirmed that,
for most of the oxides, there is an inverse correlation between the
band gap and the real part of permittivity. They compiled the result
of well-known oxides in Figure 7. However, they also mentioned that there do exist certain
materials that show large permittivity, despite their large band gaps.

However, in EMI shielding applications, it is the trend of
dielectric
loss and tan δ that is a primary concern as our focus lies in
lossy materials. Dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and tan δ
of each material are all size-dependent and frequency-dependent functions.
Thus, it becomes complicated to find a universal law that suits each
material and for all frequencies. However, studies have been done
to understand the underlying principles. Sun et al.64 studied the dielectric suppression and their dependence
on band gap for nanometric semiconductors. The complex dielectric
constant was correlated to the band gap, which has a dependence on
the crystal field. The crystal field was further found to be a function
of atomic separation and charge transportation. They have also plotted
a graph showing energy dependence of the suppression of ε″
of the nanometric semiconductors with respect to the direct and indirect
band gap transitions. It is observed that (Δεr″/εr′) increases as (ℏω/Eg) increases. Sati et al.65 studied the variation of dielectric constant and dielectric
loss at 5 MHz frequency as a function of Hf doping in BaTiO3. They showed that with an increase in Hf doping in BaTiO3, the band gap increases and the value of the dielectric constant
and that of dielectric loss/tan δ systematically decrease. They
have also stated that it is well-studied that Hf doping at the Ti
site reduces tetragonality, which probably leads to the decrease in
the value of dielectric constant. They also mentioned that Penn theoretically
derived the dielectric constant (ε′) of semiconductors
in terms of plasma frequency (ωp) and optical band
gap (Eg) as65 8  As per the
Drude’s theory, ωp is defined as
(ne2/meε0)0.5, where n is the number density
of electrons, e is the electric charge, me is the effective mass of the electron, and ε0 is the permittivity of free space.66

For an insulating/semiconducting system, the dielectric loss,
that
is, leakage current, is related to band gap according to the following
equation:65 9  Equation 9 implies that, with
an increase in the band
gap, the conductivity should decrease. In their work, they further
proposed that increasing the value of Eg leads to a decrease in the tunneling probability of electron from
the valence band to the conduction band, which resulted in the lowering
of dielectric loss.

Hence, the general rule of thumb implies
that, with the increase
in the band gap, the dielectric constant decreases (as shown in Figure 7 and eq 8).54,63,65 The same trend is followed by dielectric loss. As
the band gap increases, the conductivity decreases and subsequently
the dielectric loss decreases (as shown in eqs 7 and 9).54,65 It is to be noted that this rule may not be universally applicable
in all the cases as exceptions do exist.63 Moreover, unlike homogeneous material, these theories become even
more complicated in the case of heterogeneous materials, such as polymer
nanocomposites.

5 Do Semiconducting Fillers
Have the Potential
to Replace the Conventional Fillers?
Semiconducting fillers
might stand as a potential candidate for
EMI shielding applications. It depends primarily on electrical conductivity
and the dielectric/magnetic properties of the material. It is observed
that semiconductors with electrical conductivity near 1 S/m show reasonable
EM absorption behavior. Many semiconductors such as ZnO, TiO2, MoS2, CoO, BaTiO3, SrTiO3, etc.
are known to have good dielectric properties which play a crucial
role in the losses, whereas there are a couple of semiconductors which
have adequate magnetic properties (e.g., Fe2O3, Fe3O4, etc.), which aid in the EM absorption
behavior. Hence, it is primarily the mechanism of shielding through
the various types of losses (dipolar, interfacial, conduction, eddy
current, magnetic) that decides whether a semiconducting material
will prove to be a good shield for EM absorption. The mechanism of
shielding is decided by the structure of each individual material/materials
in the polymer matrix as well as their size and morphological features.
Moreover, the mechanism is also governed by the interaction of these
nanomaterials at various junctions, the state of aggregation, and
the synergistic response of the polymer nanocomposite to the incoming
EM radiations. Here, it is also worthwhile to note that there exist
theories that correlate band gap to dielectric constant and dielectric
loss. It is observed that with an increase in the band gap, both the
dielectric constant and dielectric loss decrease. However, it may
not be universally true for all semiconducting materials and at all
frequencies. Moreover, for heterogeneous materials, such as polymer
nanocomposites, these theories become even more complicated. To maximize
the EM absorption properties, it is desirable to maximize tan δε using a material with low dielectric constant and high
dielectric loss. The other aspect to be noted is that the characteristic
impedance of the absorber material (z = (μ/ε)1/2, valid for ideal dielectric) should be as close to the
characteristic impedance of free space (Z0 = (μ0/ε0)1/2 = 377
Ω) in order to maximize EM absorption. If permittivity meets
the EM impedance match requirement, a higher dielectric loss implies
better EM absorption properties.54

Our survey of the existing literature shows that semiconducting
fillers meet the commercial requirement of EMI shielding value of
−20 dB and above, only at high loading percentage. It is to
be noted that as the loading percentage of filler is increased, the
mechanical aspect of the shield material is compromised. However,
to exploit the absorption losses incurred due to the presence of semiconducting
filler, a hybrid composite serves as a better alternative solution.
For example, composites consisting of metallic or semiconductor particles
embedded in a dielectric matrix have been widely explored in the literature.60 The hybrid composite also enhances the number
of interfaces and thus the dielectric mismatch which results in better
shielding behavior.
