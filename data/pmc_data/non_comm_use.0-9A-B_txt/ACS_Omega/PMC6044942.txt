Honeybee silk proteins can be produced
at high levels in recombinant
systems, fabricated into materials, and are tolerant of amino acid
modifications: properties that make them exciting templates for designing
new functional materials. Here, we explore the properties of materials
either made from silk-antimicrobial peptide (AMP) fusion proteins
or silk containing entrapped AMPs or silver nanoparticles. Inclusion
of AMP within the silk protein sequence did not affect our ability
to express the proteins or process them into films. When AMP-silk
proteins and Escherichia coli cells
were coincubated in solution, a reduction in cell numbers was observed
after degradation of the chimeric protein to release a truncated version
of the AMP. In films, the AMP was retained in the silk with leaching
rates of <1% per day. Films containing silver nanoparticles were
antimicrobial, with the silk preventing aggregation of nanoparticles
and slowing the rate of dissolution of the particles.

Introduction
Antibiotic resistance
is a growing problem in health care. Systemic
antibiotics are failing, and few replacements have been found in recent
decades.1 New technologies to control microbial
infections are needed.2 Two antimicrobial
ingredients that are currently receiving considerable attention are
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and silver nanoparticles. AMPs are short
cationic peptides that are part of the innate immune system found
in living organisms.3 α-Helical AMPs,
which assume an amphipathic α-helical conformation in microbial
membranes, are the most abundant group of AMPs.4 Two of the most studied peptides from this group are magainin,
derived from Xenopus, and its synthetic
analogue pexiganan.5,6 Pexiganan is a 22 amino acid peptide
with activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal species,7,8 which has been shown to be effective as a topical coating for treating
infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers9 and, when entrapped within collagen matrices as a wound
dressing, has been demonstrated to reduce the likelihood of infection.10

Silver is an antimicrobial that has been
used for more than six
millennia to prevent microbial infections, with Herodotus dictating
that “no Persian king would drink water that was not transported
in silver containers”.11 Silver
is now used widely: silver sulfadiazine is in the WHO Model List of
Essential Medicines as an anti-infective medicine. Silver, in various
forms, is commercially available for a range of medical conditions
from wound dressings to treatments for warts and corns. Silver has
also been incorporated into clothing to produce “odor-free
clothes”, and its presence in food containers and washing machines
is marketed as a way to reduce bacterial numbers.

The use of
silver salt preparations remains controversial. The
nitrate component of silver nitrate used in burn treatment is toxic
to tissues and can decrease wound healing,12 and a recent Cochrane review has found that silver sulfadiazine
applied directly to a burn increases the rate of infection by between
8 and 80%.13 These findings are prompting
a move away from silver-based solutions for wound treatment. Instead,
elemental silver preparations are increasingly being used as an alternative,
with a myriad of products commercially available that use silver nanoparticles
as the active ingredient.

Our laboratory is developing recombinant
honeybee silk proteins
as templates for designing new materials. The honeybee silk protein,
AmelF3, has been expressed in transgenic Escherichia
coli at high levels14 and
fabricated into solid-state materials such as fibers, scaffolds, and
films.15−18 The ability to modify these proteins using molecular biology allows
us to insert nonnatural peptide motifs into their primary sequence.
The natural sequence variation of homologous silk proteins from different
species19,20 suggests that such modifications will not
compromise the ability of the protein to function as a silk material.
Materials generated from recombinant honeybee silk have been demonstrated
to entrap and stabilize metal cofactors,21,22 proteins,17 and viruses,23 indicating that, in addition to adding functionality by
modifying the primary sequence, further functionality can be obtained
by entrapping bioactive molecules within the silk materials.

In this work, we investigate the antimicrobial activity of several
composite recombinant honeybee silk materials: chimeric silk-AMP proteins,
silk with entrapped AMPs, and silk with entrapped silver nanoparticles.
Previous studies have demonstrated that E. coli is susceptible to both AMPs and silver ions;5,24 hence,
we used a common laboratory strain of E. coli to investigate the ability of these compounds to render honeybee
silk antimicrobial.

Results and Discussion
Antimicrobial Activity
of AMP-Silk Chimeric Proteins
AMPs are receiving widespread
research attention as an alternative
to existing antibiotic compounds.3 However,
the use of peptide-based drugs is limited by their rapid degradation
which requires the use of very high and therefore toxic concentrations
during therapeutic applications.10 Methods
to stabilize or deliver these drugs to their site of action are required
before their full potential can be realized. Recent studies have demonstrated
that some AMPs retained efficacy despite being attached to fusion
partners such as other AMPs,25 recombinant
spider silk proteins,26 recombinant elastin,27 or other proteins.28−30 Here, we investigated
whether inclusion of the AMP, pexiganan, in honeybee silk generates
antimicrobial materials and/or stabilizes the peptide.

As with
other so-called α-helical AMPs, the pexiganan peptide is unstructured
in solution and assumes an antiparallel dimer of amphipathic helices
in the presence of microbial membranes, leading to membrane permeabilization,
cell lysis, and cell death.31 In solution,
different portions of the honeybee silk protein adopt structures similar
to the solution and membrane-bound structures of the pexiganan peptide:
the N- and C-termini being unstructured, and the central region adopting
a coiled-coil structure comprising multiple amphipathic helices.32 We designed AMP-silk chimeric proteins in which
different regions of the silk protein were replaced or extended with
the pexiganan protein sequence: either at the C-terminus of the silk
protein (construct T: terminal extension); as an extension of the
silk protein’s coiled-coil region (construct E: extension);
or as a partial replacement of the silk protein’s coiled-coil
region (construct R: replacement) (Figure 1). On the basis of previous examples in the
literature,25−30 we expected that construct T was most likely to show antimicrobial
activity.

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the placement of the 22 amino acid
pexiganan AMP in honeybee silk protein (AmelF3). Construct R (replacement)
retains the length of the native AmelF3 sequence with the end of the
coiled-coil domain being deleted and replaced with the AMP. Construct
E (extension) has the AMP added onto the end of the coiled-coil region.
Construct T (terminal) has the pexiganan added to the C-terminus of
the silk protein.

Consistent with earlier
studies that had demonstrated that the
expression of AMPs into E. coli inclusion
bodies masks the toxic effects of the peptides during production (see
Ref (33)), the presence
of the antimicrobial sequences attached to the silk protein did not
have a detrimental effect on the high-level expression of E and R
constructs into the inclusion body. The T construct, which placed
the AMP sequence at the C-terminus, was expressed at a lower rate,
although protein expression did not appear to adversely affect the
cell growth. After solubilization and purification, all three chimeric
proteins were solubilized, purified, and fabricated into transparent
films which did not differ in handling ability and visual characteristics
from films generated from unmodified proteins.17 This result showed that large modifications to the silk
protein at various locations along the protein backbone do not inhibit
our ability to make these proteins into solid-state materials.

Initially, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of silk materials
using a simple laboratory assay based on that described by Lok et
al.34E. coli strain K-12 cells [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 27325]
were a convenient tool for this purpose because their growth rate
in medium is reproducible; therefore, differences in population growth
rates could be attributed to sample treatments.35 This method which is convenient for comparing treatments
that have log-scale effects on cell numbers yet can detect more modest
antimicrobial effects than determined from standard minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) assays. We incubated E. coli cells with films generated from unmodified honeybee silk protein
in a nutrient-free buffer. After a set incubation period, bacterial
growth medium was added and growth of the culture was monitored by
measuring the optical density (OD) at 600 nm for up to 20 h (Figure 2). The slope of the
linear part of the growth curve did not differ between control and
silk-exposed populations (control: 197 ± 2.2 × 10–5; silk: 195 ± 0.57 × 10–5 OD units·min–1), indicating that the recombinant silk film was essentially
inert to E. coli growth during the
growth phase. The population of the cells in the presence of silk
achieved log-phase growth earlier than the control population, indicating
that a higher proportion of cells survived the incubation in the nutrient-free
buffer, suggesting that the silk film protects the cells during this
initial incubation.

Figure 2 Growth curves of E. coli populations
after incubation in the presence and absence of recombinant honeybee
silk films. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean of
measurements from 18 cultures.

We repeated the assay using stabilized films generated from
the
silk proteins modified with AMPs at various positions. None of the
films generated from the chimeric proteins led to a decrease in E. coli numbers. We also tested the antimicrobial
activity of chimeric silk films using zone of inhibition assays, where
films were incubated in the presence of a growing lawn of E. coli cells, and did not observe any clearing around
the films. The lack of antimicrobial activity was not likely due to
the inactivation of the AMP by the aqueous methanol treatment used
to stabilize the silk films18 because synthetic
pexiganan treated with aqueous methanol in the absence of silk protein
retained activity.

To understand the loss of efficacy of the
AMP in our silk materials,
we investigated the rate of release of synthetic pexiganan entrapped
in the silk films using a fluorescently labeled pexiganan variant.
Leaching of the labeled peptide from the silk films was slow, with
only around 2% of the peptide leaching out of the films containing
25% AMP after 1 week incubation (Figure 3). We used a nonlabeled synthetic pexiganan
to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the silk films containing
entrapped synthetic pexiganan (Figure 4). Controls without silk film showed antimicrobial
activity consistent with previous reports,5,9 whereas
low levels of antimicrobial activity were observed from films containing
high levels of AMP (500 μg AMP: 1.5 mg of silk, equivalent to
1 mg·mL–1 in the assay), and no antimicrobial
activity was observed with AMP loadings containing the equivalent
of 5–25 × MIC (Figure 4).

Figure 3 Amount of fluorescently labeled pexiganan (AMP) released
from silk
protein films in solution over time.

Figure 4 Growth curves obtained after E. coli cells are incubated with pexiganan alone or pexiganan entrapped
in honeybee silk.

The reduced antimicrobial
activity of the loaded films was consistent
with the low levels of leaching of the labeled peptide from the silk
films (Figure 3). The
low levels of pexiganan leaching from our protein films are in contrast
to that observed by Gopinath et al.10 who
reported around 80% release of pexiganan from collagen films containing
1.5% AMP over 30 h.

Stabilization of the honeybee silk films
using methanol increases
the amount of β-sheet structure in the silk materials.18 Although our results demonstrated that methanol
treatment had no effect on the peptide in isolation, the extensive
H-bonding network associated with β-sheet structure that arises
from this treatment in the silk likely tethers the peptide within
the material reducing its release rate. Similarly, a reduction in
antimicrobial activity was found to be associated with the formation
of β-sheet structure in spider silk-AMP fusion proteins.26 The association of β-sheet structure and
peptide release gives us a starting point to design a material that
will allow controlled long-term release of AMP.

To understand
if the absence of antimicrobial activity in our chimeric
proteins was the result of fusion of the AMP to the silk protein or
due to masking of the activity due to the solid-state format of the
silk-AMP proteins, we incubated soluble silk-AMP proteins with E. coli cells in solution rather than in solid-state
formats. Initial tests using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) guidelines M07-A7 and M27-A3 with proteins at 3 and 6 mg·mL–1 did not detect antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative
bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, or fungus. Using an agar plate counting
assay, capable of detecting more modest reductions in cell numbers,
we found a reduction in E. coli numbers
when cells were exposed to 3 mg·mL–1 protein
(equivalent to 227 μg·mL–1 AMP; 10 times
the published MIC for E. coli(5)) (Figure 5A). Greater activity was observed when either the incubation
time or the number of cells in the protein solutions was increased
(Figure 5A). Similar
reduction in the E. coli cell number
was found after incubation of cells with any of the three chimeric
constructs.

size E. coli populations for different
incubation periods in the presence of solutions of the silk protein
(AmelF3) or chimeric silk-AMP proteins (construct E). (B) Degradation

(−) E. coli cells. Arrows indicate
major degradation products from each protein. (C) Cell numbers remaining
after incubation of 105 cells·mL–1E. coli for 1 h with recombinant honeybee silk protein
or various silk-AMP proteins.

To understand why incubation in the presence of increased E. coli cell numbers and/or increased incubation
time resulted in greater antimicrobial activity, we compared the silk
proteins, before and after incubation with E. coli cells, using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) (Figure 5B). SDS-PAGE showed that the silk-AMP proteins were degraded during
incubation with E. coli. We investigated
the major degradation products using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopic
analysis and found that the proteins were cleaved between the 4th
Lys and 5th Phe of the pexiganan sequence. Zasloff6 has shown that truncation of magainin 2 in the equivalent
position results in an increase in the MIC for E. coli by around 30 times. Given the relationship between incubation time,
cell number, and antimicrobial activity, we attribute the antimicrobial
activity observed in the silk-AMP chimeric protein study to products
that arise after proteolysis of the AMP in the chimeric proteins during
the incubation period by exogenous proteases released by E. coli. Similar activity was observed for all three
constructs, suggesting that the presence of silk protein sequences
at the C-terminus of the AMP did not negatively affect the activity
(Figure 5C).

The results presented here demonstrate that we are able to produce
silk-AMP chimeric proteins without negatively affecting the protein
expression levels or the ability to form into materials. Even when
not covalently attached to the silk protein, the AMP remains entrapped
within the silk material, indicating that there is a strong interaction
between the peptide and the silk material. These properties provide
a platform for designing a responsive wound dressing material. Possibly,
by controlling the β-sheet content in the materials, we may
be able to control peptide leaching rates. Alternatively, signals
that trigger dissolution of the silk will allow entrapped AMP to be
stably maintained in the silk and then released when required.

Silver
Nanoparticles Are Stabilized and Make Silk Antimicrobial
When Entrapped in Films
The ability of entrapped silver nanoparticles
to render honeybee silk materials antimicrobial was assessed. Silver
is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent used widely in medical and
consumer products. It is the silver ions that are active, and in the
metallic form, silver is not antimicrobial.36 However, metallic silver nanoparticles are frequently used in consumer
products because silver ions in gel or liquid form rapidly diffuse
and are easily precipitated by a range of counterions, and therefore,
local effective concentrations cannot be maintained. When silver nanoparticles
are exposed to water and oxygen, the surface dissolves to release
silver ions.

Suspensions of E. coli cells were exposed to recombinant honeybee silk protein films containing
entrapped silver nanoparticles for 2 h, and the size of the surviving
population was compared to that of the control population (Figure 3). Population sizes
were back calculated from the bacterial growth curves after the addition
of growth media, and based on the time, the cell density reached 0.2
absorption units (600 nm), assuming consistent growth rates across
all treatments. This method requires that the toxicity of silver be
neutralized by the addition of the chloride ions in the bacterial
growth media, and if the silver ions remained present then it would
be expected that the growth curves of the microbial population would
be affected. We compared the rate of population growth in all treatments
and found them to be statistically similar (Supporting Figure 1), thus justifying the use of the growth curve to compare
population sizes after treatments.

The antimicrobial activity
of the silver nanoparticles entrapped
in the silk was compared to positive control treatments containing
only nanoparticles (Figure 6). The positive controls demonstrated expected antimicrobial
activity, with 10 nm nanoparticles showing greater activity compared
to 100 nm nanoparticles (Figure 6). The greater activity of the smaller nanoparticles
can be attributed to their larger surface area/weight ratio, leading
to the release of more silver ions. As with controls, when entrapped
within the silk, again the antimicrobial effect was correlated to
the surface area of the entrapped silver. The activity conferred by
the entrapped silver particles was lower than the activity from the
control samples without silk, with nearly 10 times as much as entrapped
silver nanoparticles required to give antimicrobial activity similar
to controls containing silver alone (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Proportion of surviving E. coli cells
after exposure to silver nanoparticles entrapped in recombinant honeybee
silk films (with silk) compared to the equivalent amount of silver
without silk (no silk). Error bars show standard error from four replicates.

To understand the activity of
the silver nanoparticles when entrapped
in silk, we investigated the stability of the particles with and without
entrapment. We compared the stability of free particles or particles
entrapped in silk films, by monitoring their absorbance at 390 nm
over time in aqueous buffer. The absorbance of the free particles
rapidly declined in the first 100 h of incubation (Figure 7). No shift in absorbance to
higher wavelengths was observed, indicating that the silver nanoparticles
were dissolving rather than aggregating. In comparison, only a relatively
modest loss of absorption was observed when the silver was entrapped
within the silk films (Figure 7). We conclude from this that entrapment of silver nanoparticles
within the silk films reduces the rate of dissolution of the particles.
Similarly, Wen et al.37 report a significant
reduction of silver ion release from silver nanoparticles in the presence
of cytoskeletal proteins. This stabilization of the silver within
the silk protein solution provides a method to deliver silver ions
and hence antimicrobial activity, over a sustained period of time.

or entrapped in recombinant honeybee silk film covered by solution
(silk) over time. Error bars show standard error from four replicates.

Conclusions
Recombinant
AMP, pexiganan, can be produced within honeybee silk
proteins as inclusion bodies in E. coli, and this modification does not affect the ability of the host silk
proteins to form films. A simple antimicrobial assay was developed
that used the growth kinetics of laboratory strain E. coli to assess the efficacy of known antimicrobial
agents. The recombinant silk materials themselves do not affect the
growth kinetics of E. coli cells. AMP
efficacy required the AMP to be released from the silk proteins. Although
this technique does not generate an antimicrobial material per se,
it provides a method for protein designers to present a bioactive
peptide in an inactive form that can be activated upon proteolytic
release. In solid-state materials, free AMP was retained within the
recombinant silk material, leaching at low rates, thus providing a
platform for designing a responsive wound dressing. Recombinant silk
protein films entrap silver nanoparticles, preventing aggregation
and reducing their rate of dissolution. The silk silver material had
antimicrobial activity correlating to the amount and morphology of
the entrapped silver nanoparticles. These results contribute to our
understanding of how we can fabricate a responsive antimicrobial material
in the future.

Expression and Purification
of Silk-AMP Chimeric Proteins
The silk-AMP chimeric proteins
were produced in the inclusion bodies
of E. coli cells using previously described
methods developed for the high-level expression of the silk protein.14 Briefly, the silk-AMP expression plasmids were
transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2
(DE3) competent cells (Novagen), plated onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar
containing 100 μg·mL–1 ampicillin, and
then incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. A starter culture from a single
colony was grown at 37 °C for 1 h, transferred into a 1 L Overnight
Express Instant Terrific Broth (Novagen) containing 100 μg·mL–1 ampicillin and 10 mL of glycerol in shaking flasks,
and then incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Recombinant E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation at
5000g for 15 min, and inclusion bodies were purified
after the cells were lysed in BugBuster Master Mix (Novagen), containing
1% Benzonase Nuclease (Novagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Washed inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 M guanidine
hydrochloride (Sigma) in 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 40 mM imidazole
(His buffer kit; GE Healthcare) by incubation at 4 °C for 24
h. Nonsolubilized protein and particulate matter were removed by centrifugation
at 5000g for 30 min. Supernatant was filtered through
a 0.22 μm Millex syringe filter unit (Merck). The silk-AMP protein
was purified by binding the supernatant to a HisTrap HP column (GE
Healthcare), washing the bound protein in 20 mM buffer containing
40 mM imidazole, and then eluting the proteins in 20 mM buffer containing
250 mM imidazole. The salt levels were reduced, and imidazole was
removed from the protein solutions using a desalting column (GE Healthcare)
with the proteins being eluted into 25 mM NaCl. Proteins were concentrated
using Vivaspin 15R centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius), and protein
concentrations were quantified using a Direct Detect spectrophotometer
(Merck Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Antimicrobial Activity of Solid Materials
To assess
the antimicrobial activity of materials, films were cast in wells
of 24-well tissue culture plates. For studies involving silver nanoparticles,
silk films (1.5 mg of dry weight silk protein) containing 0, 0.01,
0.1, or 1% of 10 nm or 100 nm diameter silver nanoparticles (nanoComposix)
were formed by mixing 1% silk protein solutions with either 2 mM sodium
citrate buffer (no silver control) or the appropriate amount of silver
nanoparticles in 2 mM sodium citrate buffer. Four films were prepared
for each condition. The absorbance spectra of silver nanoparticles
in silk films (Supporting Figure 1) were
similar to the spectra obtained in dispersed solutions. Controls included
silver nanoparticles in equivalent amounts of water and silk protein
without silver nanoparticles. Mixtures were cast into plastic trays,
and water was allowed to evaporate. The resultant films were transparent
(controls), with yellow (10 nm particles) or pink (100 nm particles)
coloration. The films were stabilized by overnight treatment with
aqueous (70%) methanol, according to the method of Huson et al.18 The loss of silver nanoparticles during the
stabilization treatment was around 10%, as determined from the OD
at 390 nm of the aqueous methanol solution after stabilization treatment
compared with a standard curve from silver nanoparticles in 70% methanol.
Consistent with this, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
of films showed around 9% loss of silver from the material after methanol
treatment.

E. coli cells grown
to log phase (3 × 105 cfu·mL–1) in 100 μL N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer were placed
on top of the stabilized silk films or controls and then incubated
in a shaker at 75 rpm for 2 h at room temperature. HEPES buffer does
not chelate metal ions.40 After this treatment,
the antimicrobial effect of silver was neutralized by the addition
of an equivalent volume of ×2 LB to each well, with the chloride
ions in the LB precipitating silver ions from the solution. The proportion
of surviving E. coli cell numbers relative
to controls was determined from the time it took for cultures to reach
an OD at 600 nm of 0.2, assuming a doubling time of 20 min, at 37
°C.

The antimicrobial properties of films containing entrapped
pexiganan
were examined similarly. Silk films (1.5 mg of silk) containing 0,
50, 100, or 500 μg synthetic pexiganan, controls containing
10 and 50 μg synthetic pexiganan, or silk alone were assayed
in 1 mL of solution. These amounts of pexiganan were chosen based
on published MIC of the peptide against E. coli ATCC 25922 (16 μg·mL–1).5,9

For films generated from the chimeric silk-AMP protein, a
zone
of inhibition assay was also used. Films, stabilized by overnight
treatment in aqueous methanol, were placed on LB agar plates seeded
with a lawn of E. coli cells. After
overnight incubation, the plates were inspected for clearing zones
around the silk films.

Antimicrobial Adhesion Activity of Silk-AMP
Chimeric Proteins
in Solutions
The antimicrobial activities of the silk-AMP
chimeric proteins in solution were determined initially using a standard
microbroth dilution assay in accordance with the CLSI guideline M07-A7.
Briefly, frozen (−80 °C) aliquots of Staphylococcus
epidermidis RP62A (ATCC 39584), Staphylococcus
aureus (ATCC 29213), E. coli (ATCC 25922), or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) were plated on agar plates and incubated overnight
at 37 °C, and then a single colony was transferred into 5 mL
of nutrient broth (NB) and incubated at 37 °C for 5–6
h to reach log phase. The log-phase bacterial solutions were diluted
with fresh NB at OD600 = 0.1 (approximately 108 cfu·mL–1) and then further diluted 100-fold
into Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) for testing. The chimeric silk-AMP
proteins E2 (3 mg·mL–1) and T2 (6 mg·mL–1) were prepared as twofold serial dilutions in MHB.
Equal volumes of bacterial suspension and protein dilutions were mixed
in wells of a 96-well microplate and then incubated at 35 °C
for 18 h. The presence or absence of bacterial growth was examined
visually with the aid of a mirror reader. The activity against fungi
was assessed using the wild-type Candida albicans strain DAY185 according to CLSI guidelines M27-A3. Log-growth-phase
fungi were diluted to ∼1–5 × 103 cfu·mL–1 in a Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium,
then equal volumes of fungal suspension and protein dilutions (as
above) were mixed in wells of a 96-well microplate and then incubated
at 37 °C for 48 h. The presence or absence of fungal growth was
examined visually with the aid of a mirror reader.

To measure
the lower levels of antimicrobial activity that were not apparent
using the above method, a protocol similar to that used to demonstrate
the antimicrobial activity of lacritin was developed.41 The antimicrobial activity was assessed by incubating 3
mg·mL–1 recombinant silk-AMP protein with 104 to 106E. coli (ATCC
27325) cells in LB for 0, 20, or 60 min, at 37 °C, with shaking.
After treatment, the cells were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended
in LB, and the number of remaining live cells was determined by plating
the equivalent of 400 cells before treatment onto LB agar plates containing
100 mg·mL–1 ampicillin. The plates were then
incubated overnight at 37 °C, and colony-forming units (cfu)
were manually counted. The extent of proteolysis of the silk-AMP protein
during this treatment was assessed by SDS-PAGE of the supernatant,
following the removal of the cells. Degradation products were identified
by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the protein
bands separated by SDS-PAGE.

of release of pexiganan from silk films was monitored using pexiganan
N-terminal labeled with the fluorescent group, 5-carboxyfluorescein
(95% purity; Mimotopes). A standard curve of peptide in 100 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 7.6) was prepared by measuring fluorescence at 515 nm using
an excitation wavelength of 475 nm of peptide solutions ranging from
0.1 to 8 μM. Good proportionality was observed between the fluorescence
signal and peptide concentrations between 0 and 0.5 μM peptide.
Silk (1.5 mg)-labeled AMP (25, 125, 250, or 500 μg) films were
stabilized according to Huson et al.,18 and then rates of leaching of the peptide from the films into HEPES
buffer were determined by measuring the fluorescence of the buffer
solution over time.

Stability of Silver Nanoparticles Entrapped
in Silk Films
The stability of silver nanoparticles entrapped
within the silk
films compared to the stability of silver nanoparticles by monitoring
the changes in the Ultraviolet–visible spectrum of samples
in the HEPES buffer is as follows: silver nanoparticles (1 mg·mL–1) were added to the recombinant honeybee silk protein
solution (1% protein w/v) to give a final ratio of 1% silver per dry
weight of silk protein. Aliquots (100 μL) were dried in wells
of a 24-well tissue culture plate and treated with aqueous 70% methanol
overnight to stabilize the films; the methanol solution was removed,
and films were allowed to dry. HEPES buffer (pH 7.6, 400 μL)
was added to the films, and the plate was incubated at room temperature
with shaking at 500 rpm. At regular time intervals, the absorption
spectra from 300 to 600 nm from each film were collected using a SpectraMax
M3 (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer. Between sample times, the
sample volume was retained at 1 mL through the addition of water,
and the plate was covered to prevent sample drying. Control samples
contained equivalent amounts of silver nanoparticles in the same amount
of HEPES buffer.
