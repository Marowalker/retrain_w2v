The electrospinning
of highly concentrated solutions of cyclodextrin (CD) leads to bead-free
nanofibers without the need of a polymeric carrier. The occurrence
of numerous hydrogen bonds among CD molecules is the main driving
force for their electrospinning, and hence, additives with hydrogen-bonding
potential can disturb the aggregation of CD molecules and affect their
electrospinning. In this study, we systematically investigated the
influence of five different hydrogen-bonding additives, i.e., methylamine (MA),
ethylenediamine (ED), urea, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol
(HFIP), on the solution behavior of hydroxypropyl-β-CD (HP-β-CD)
by rheology, conductivity, and NMR analyses, and the morphology of
the electrospun HP-β-CD nanofibers by scanning electron microscopy.
The 1H NMR chemical shifts of the HP-β-CD protons
in D2O were observed with the incorporation of hydrogen-bonding
molecules due to the occurrence of intermolecular associations
between HP-β-CD and additives. Dynamic light scattering measurements
revealed a clear decrease in the aggregate size with the introduction
of additives. Unlike other additives, which showed a general decreasing
trend in viscosity with increasing additive content, the addition
of MA led to a significant increase in the viscosity with increasing
concentration and gave rise to HP-β-CD nanofibers at lower concentrations.
The addition of low concentrations of ED, urea, TFE, and HFIP led
to thinner nanofibers due to the lower viscosity of the respective
solutions. Increasing additive content deteriorated the electrospinnability
of HP-β-CD solutions, resulting in beaded fibers. A systematic
relationship was found between the solution viscosity and morphology
of the respective electrospun fibers. Overall, this study, for the
first time, reports the influence of hydrogen bonding on the polymer-free
electrospinning of CD molecules and shows a correlation between solution
properties and morphology of their electrospun nanofibers.

==== Body
Introduction
Cyclodextrin (CD) is
a cyclic oligomer with various numbers of glucopyranose units and
has a toroidal structure with a relatively hydrophobic cavity interior
and a hydrophilic exterior.1 The inner
cavity of CD acts as a molecular host for small hydrophobic molecules
or portions of large molecules and forms inclusion complexation with
appropriately sized molecules.2 CDs have
therefore been widely used in various forms for a wide spectrum of
applications, including textile3−5 and food industry,6,7 biomedical field,8−11 and water treatment.12−15

The electrospinning of CD solutions without the need of a
polymeric carrier was previously reported in various solvent systems
using different CD types, e.g., native CDs (α-CD,16,17 β-CD,16−18 and γ-CD17,19) and chemically modified
CDs (hydroxypropyl (HP) CDs20−22 and methylated CDs23). Further, CD-inclusion complexes were successfully
electrospun into nanofibers without using any polymeric carrier.24−27 The presence of numerous hydrogen bonds between CD molecules is
the main driving force for the formation of polymer-free CD nanofibers,
which requires highly concentrated solutions to be able to produce
a single continuous jet from their solutions. Due to their low water
solubility, the aqueous solutions of native CD molecules cannot be
used for electrospinning under mild conditions, except their highly
alkaline solutions to break hydrogen bonds among CD molecules16 or use their solutions in polar aprotic solvents,
such as a combination of dimethylformamide (DMF) and ionic liquid.18 Therefore, modified CD derivatives were mostly
exploited in the polymer-free electrospinning of CD molecules. Particularly,
hydroxypropyl (HP),20 randomly methylated,23 and sulfobutyl ether (SB)27-modified CD molecules have high solubility, exceeding 103 g/L in water and dimethylformamide (DMF) and could form highly
concentrated solutions to be electrospun into fibers in the absence
of a polymeric carrier. Likewise, the highly concentrated solutions
of tannic acid could recently be electrospun into nanofibers without
the requirement of a polymeric carrier in water/ethanol mixtures owing
to the presence of numerous hydrogen bonds.28 The electrospinning of such small molecules is governed by the presence
of numerous hydrogen bonds and is therefore highly sensitive to additives
with hydrogen-bonding potential, such as urea, which can affect their
electrospinnability.20 The hydrogen-bonded
aggregates of CD molecules can also be disturbed by the ionization
of pendant hydroxyl groups, which results in increased solubility.29 Although the electrospinning of CD solutions
without using a polymeric carrier has been well studied using different
CD types16−23 and their inclusion complexes24−27,30,31 with a wide range of molecules, the effect of hydrogen bonding on
the electrospinnability of CD molecules has remained an unresolved
issue.

Hydrogen bond occurs between two polar groups when a
hydrogen atom is bound to a highly electronegative atom having a pair
of electrons, such as oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and fluorine (F).32 The strength of this bond varies depending on
the electronegativity of the atom and increases with higher electronegativity
of hydrogen bond acceptor. CD has many hydroxyl groups whose oxygen
(O) makes hydrogen bonds with the protons of other hydroxyl groups,
water molecules, or amine-functional molecules.21,24,33 Recent studies showed that organofluorine
compounds can also form hydrogen bonds with water molecules: for instance,
F atom in CH3F acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor in its
complex with water, and this bond is about 80% strong as a hydrogen
bond in water dimer.34 Another study showed
that the fluorine of RCH2F is a superior hydrogen bond
acceptor compared to the RCHF2 and RCF3 molecules.35

this Study, and Their Potential Hydrogen-Bonding Atoms with Respect
to the Hydroxyl Groups of the HP-β-CD Are Shown in Color
In this study, the influence
of hydrogen bonding additives on the electrospinning solution
of CD molecules was studied. Five different molecules (i.e., methylamine
(MA), ethylenediamine (ED), urea, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), and
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)) having potential hydrogen-bonding
groups were used as additives (Scheme 1). Viscosity tests were conducted to elucidate
intermolecular associations in electrospinning solutions at various
concentrations of additives. The occurrence of intermolecular interactions
between CD and additive molecules was also explored by 1H NMR and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses. The electrospinning
of CD aggregates in the presence of increasing additive concentration
was performed, and the resultant electrospun CD nanofibers were investigated
in terms of morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Results
and Discussion
Due to numerous hydrogen bonds, CD can self-associate
to form aggregates in aqueous solutions. In most cases, they form
small aggregates so that the solution remains clear and transparent.
When the concentration exceeds the critical aggregation concentration
(cac), molecular associations dominate the solution behavior and lead
to the formation of large aggregates. In this regard, Garnero et al.
reported the calculated cac of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin
(HP-β-CD) from both 1H NMR and conductivity
analyses to be 77.7 and 69.3 mg/mL (∼49.5 mM), respectively.36 On the other hand, Do et al. reported the cac
values for various CDs (HP-β-CD, 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin
(HP-γ-CD), and sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD))
from different companies to be ∼20 mg/mL.37 Apart from these techniques, the aggregation can be supported
by evidence from the concentration dependence of viscosity measurement.29 However, the electrospinning of HP-β-CD
molecules takes place in the highly concentrated regime, in which
the concentration of HP-β-CD exceeds 1600 mg/mL (∼23-fold
of the cac).

All additives, i.e., MA, ED, urea, TFE, and HFIP,
are water-miscible molecules and could form homogeneous mixtures.
Due to differences in the chemical composition, each of these additives
has different hydrogen-bonding potential. Aqueous HP-β-CD solutions
containing various concentrations of additives formed clear and transparent
solutions (Figure 1b, inset). The flow behavior of these solutions was explored in the
shear rate (γ) range of 0.01–2000 s–1. All solutions displayed shear thinning behavior with increasing
shear rate (Figure S1). The viscosity (η)
of the solutions decreased with higher concentrations of additives
(Figure 1a). This decrease
in the viscosity can be ascribed to the partial breakage of hydrogen
bonds among HP-β-CD molecules with the incorporation of additive
molecules. Owing to the presence of two electronegative nitrogen (N)
atoms linked to the hydrogen bond acceptor carbonyl group, urea is
considered as the strongest hydrogen-disrupting molecule among the
additives and hence should lead to the lowest viscosity. Therefore,
the most obvious decrease was observed for the sample containing urea,
followed by TFE. The η of the HP-β-CD solution significantly
decreased from 0.677 (±0.034) to 0.135 (±0.013) Pa s with
the addition of 40% (w/v) urea. Likewise, the η decreased to
0.138 (±0.016) Pa s with the incorporation of 40% (w/v) TFE.
A similar decreasing trend was also observed for the samples containing
40% (w/v) of HFIP and ED: η decreased to 0.226 (±0.030)
and 0.235 (±0.016) Pa s with the addition of 40% (w/v) HFIP and
ED, respectively. Unlike other additives, the addition of MA significantly
increased the viscosity: η increased from 0.370 (±0.092)
to 516 (±68) Pa s with an increasing MA concentration from 2.5
to 20% (w/v) (Figure 1a). The aggregation behavior of CD molecules in the presence of different
additives was explored by DLS analysis (Figure S2), where the size of CD aggregates drastically decreased
with the incorporation of additives: the size of CD aggregates reduced
from 163 (±14) to 80 (±9), 56 (±4), 25 (±7.8),
24 (±4), and 16 (±5) nm in the presence of 2.5% (w/v) TFE,
HFIP, ED, urea, and MA, respectively. Thereafter, an increase in the
aggregate size was observed with a concentration rise of additives
since the actual concentration was higher than the critical aggregation
concentration.

Figure 1 (a) Viscosity (η at the shear rate of 0.1 s–1) of aqueous HP-β-CD solutions (c = 160% (w/v)) containing various concentrations of additives, i.e.,
HFIP, ED, MA, TFE, and urea. (b) Conductivity of HP-β-CD solutions
containing 20% (w/v) of additives and an additive-free HP-β-CD
solution (noted as blank). The inset shows the optical photo of the
HP-β-CD solutions containing 20% (w/v) additives.

Since electrospinning is a process that relies
on electrical forces to draw charged jets of highly viscous solutions
of polymers and nonpolymeric systems, solution conductivity has a
significant impact on the electrospinning process. The conductivity
values of HP-β-CD solutions containing 20% (w/v) additives are
shown in Figure 1b,
where the conductivity of 160% (w/v) HP-β-CD solution was measured
as 9 μS/cm because of the poor conductivity of HP-β-CD
molecules in water. However, with the incorporation of additives,
the conductivity increased with an order of TFE, HFIP, urea, ED, and
MA. Unlike other additives, the addition of 20% (w/v) MA drastically
increased conductivity to 161 μS/cm (Figure 1b), whereas the conductivity of an HP-β-CD
solution containing 20% (w/v) urea was measured as 46 μS/cm.

The occurrence of intermolecular interactions between HP-β-CD
and additive molecules was confirmed by 1H NMR analysis,
where the proton peaks of CD molecules revealed negative or positive
chemical shifts. The chemical structure of the HP-β-CD molecule
and the assignments of CD protons are shown in Figure 2a, while Figure 2b shows the 1H NMR spectra of
HP-β-CD solutions (c = 25 mg/mL) in D2O in the absence and presence of MA of various molar ratios (i.e.,
n[additive]/[CD] = 0.5, 1, 2, and 4). The methyl protons
of the hydroxypropyl group show a doublet peak at 1.1 ppm, while proton
H1 resonates between 5.03 and 5.2 ppm appearing as two sets of doublets
owing to the H1 protons of hydroxypropyl substituents in different
positions. The signal at 5.11 ppm can be attributed to glucopyranose
with no substitution, while the peak at 5.2 ppm can be ascribed to
the H1 protons of glucopyranose with HP substituents. A similar spectrum
for HP-β-CD molecules was observed by Chay et al., and the authors
attributed this second peak to the hydroxypropyl-substituted glucopyranose.38 The other peaks of the HP-β-CD appeared
at 3.578 ppm for H2, 3.882 ppm for H3, 3.458 ppm for H4, 3.781 ppm
for H5, 3.816 ppm for H6, 3.669 ppm for H7, and 3.972 ppm for H8. 1H NMR analysis allows the determination of complexation behavior
in terms of estimation of the sites of interactions between HP-β-CD
and additives. It is known that H3 and H5 protons are located in the
CD cavity, while H1, H2, and H4 protons are located on the outside
of the CD cavity.39 The shift in the positions
of these protons shows whether the interactions take place as inclusion
complexation or hydrogen bonding with the exterior OH groups of CD
molecules. From the spectra shown in Figure 2, the chemical shifts of glucopyranose protons
were determined. With increasing MA concentration, the peak intensities
drastically dropped, and the chemical shifts of the H1, H2, and H4
protons were observed, suggesting the existence of interactions between
the protons of HP-β-CD and MA. A similar shift was reported
for the complexation of flurbiprofen and β-CD molecules, and
the proton peaks shifted to lower ppm values upon the addition of
flurbiprofen.40 The change in chemical
shifts (Δδ) in the absence and presence of an additive
molecule was followed over the same protons, i.e., Δδ
= δHP-β-CD/additive –
δHP-β-CD. Upon addition of higher
amount of MA, clear shifts were observed for H1, H2, and H4, suggesting
the presence of interactions between MA and the exterior protons of
the HP-β-CD. On the other hand, proton chemical shifts were
more distinctive for other additives (Figure 2c–f). The most obvious changes were
observed for HFIP, followed by ED, urea, MA, and TFE. The addition
of increasing concentration of ED led to the chemical shifts of HP-β-CD
protons (Figure 2c).
HP-β-CD protons shifted to higher ppm with the addition of higher
concentration of ED, whereas the incorporation of higher amount of
HFIP shifted the HP-β-CD protons to lower ppm (Figure 2e). A similar trend was observed
for TFE, demonstrating that both TFE and HFIP similarly interacted
with HP-β-CD molecules (Figure 2d). However, the addition of urea led to the downfield
of H1 protons of HP-β-CD molecules (Figure 2f). Overall, 1H NMR studies showed
the presence of interactions between additives and HP-β-CD molecules,
and these interactions led to the chemical shifts of HP-β-CD
protons with an increasing concentration of additives. The incorporation
of MA and ED showed obvious chemical shifts for the exterior protons
of CD molecules (Figure 3a,b). On the other hand, other additives likely formed inclusion
complexation with CD molecules due to chemical shifts in the positions
of H3 and H5 protons (Figure 3c,e).

The electrospinning of the HP-β-CD
solutions at various concentrations was performed, and the formation
of electrosprayed beads and beaded fibers was observed at the HP-β-CD
concentration of ≤120 wt % (Figure 4). The diameter of electrosprayed beads increased
with higher HP-β-CD content, at which only HP-β-CD microsized
beads were formed at 60% (w/v) with a mean bead diameter of 1.91 μm.
On the other hand, the electrosprayed beads obtained at the 100% (w/v)
HP-β-CD were 3.20 μm in diameter, suggesting enhanced
intramolecular interactions with a concentration rise of the HP-β-CD
so that larger beads were formed. The solution containing 120% (w/v)
HP-β-CD led to extended beads, while beaded fibers were observed
at the HP-β-CD concentration of 140% (w/v). The increase of
the HP-β-CD concentration to 160% (w/v) led to bead-free HP-β-CD
nanofibers with a mean diameter of 780 nm. These results
are consistent with the previous report on the electrospun nanofibers
obtained at the identical concentration of HP-β-CD molecules
in water.20 The electrospinning of HP-β-CD
in water (c = 160 wt %) led to nanofibers in the
size range of 250–1780 nm, whereas the electrospinning of HP-β-CD
in DMF at 120 wt % formed larger nanofibers in the size range of 400–1800
nm.20 When the HP-β-CD concentration
is very low, the occurrence of beaded nanofibers was observed, suggesting
that intramolecular interactions between HP-β-CD aggregates
are not strong enough to drive the formation of bead-free nanofibers.

at various concentrations: (a) 60 wt %, (b) 80 wt %, (c) 100 wt %,

size distribution plots of the electrosprayed HP-β-CD beads
(a–c). Inset (f) shows the size distribution plot of the nanofibers.

The importance of hydrogen bonding
on the electrospinning of HP-β-CD molecules can also be confirmed
by varying the solution pH. The pH of the electrospinning medium is
highly critical for hydrogen-bonded aggregation as in the case of
HP-β-CD molecules due to the ionization of OH groups of CDs.29 The viscosities of 160% (w/v) HP-β-CD
molecules in solutions having pH values 3 and 14 were measured as
0.331 (±0.068) and 0.525 (±0.053) Pa s, respectively, whereas
the viscosity of the sample prepared at neutral pH was 0.677 (±0.034)
Pa s. The nanofibers produced at a pH of 3 exhibited beaded nanofibers
due to lower viscosity of the solution, whereas the nanofibers produced
at a pH of 14 showed bead-free nanofibers, but with decreased electrospinnability
(Figure S3). The results suggest that the
pH of the electrospinning solution is important, particularly for
those produced from polymer-free hydrogen-bonded assemblies.

The additives with hydrogen-bonding potential can influence the HP-β-CD
aggregation by disturbing hydrogen bonds among HP-β-CD molecules
and hence affect their electrospinning. The urea addition at various
concentrations at the constant HP-β-CD content (c = 160% (w/v)) was investigated over the morphology of the resultant
nanofibers (Figure 5). The addition of urea caused a significant decrease in the fiber
diameter, and above 20% (w/v) of urea, beaded nanofibers were observed.
A similar observation was also reported by Celebioglu et al. (2012).20 The mean size of the nanofibers decreased from
800 to 730 nm with an increasing urea concentration from 2.5 to 20%
(w/v). Further, the morphological changes of the nanofibers were supported
by the viscosity data of the respective solutions: the viscosity of
the HP-β-CD solutions significantly decreased with a urea
concentration rise: the viscosity of the respective solutions decreased
from 0.509 (±0.038) to 0.135 (±0.013) Pa s with increasing
urea concentration from 1 to 40% (w/v). The effect of urea on HP-β-CD
electrospinning was also investigated at a lower HP-β-CD
concentration (140 wt %). All fibers revealed beaded structure due
to the lower concentration of HP-β-CD molecules (Figure S4), which could not produce a bead-free
fiber structure as revealed with the urea-free sample (Figure 4e). Even at this concentration
of HP-β-CD (i.e., 140 wt %), the morphology of beaded fibers
transformed into electrosprayed beads at 40% (w/v), demonstrating
the disruptive effect of urea on the electrospinning of HP-β-CDs
(Figure S5). This is in line with the viscosity
of the respective solutions, which drastically decreased from 0.256
(±0.035) to 0.113 (±0.026) Pa s with increasing urea concentration
from 2.5 to 20% (w/v) at the HP-β-CD concentration of 140 wt
% (Figure S6).

Figure 5 Scanning electron micrographs
of the electrospun HP-β-CD nanofibers (c =
160% (w/v)) produced at various urea concentrations: (a) 1% (w/v),
(b) 2.5% (w/v), (c) 5% (w/v), (d) 10% (w/v), (e) 20% (w/v), and (f)
40% (w/v). The insets show the size distributions of the nanofibers.

As observed for the addition of
urea, the incorporation of ED resulted in the formation of thinner
HP-β-CD nanofibers at low concentrations while beaded nanofibers
were observed with a further rise in the concentration of ED to 40%
(w/v) (Figure 6). The
mean fiber diameter decreased from 430 to 320 nm with increasing ED
concentration from 2.5 to 40% (w/v). This can also be seen over the
viscosity of the respective solutions with an increasing ED concentration.
The viscosity of the HP-β-CD solutions having ED concentration
decreased from 0.297 (±0.026) to 0.235 (±0.016) Pa s with
increasing ED concentration from 1 to 40% (w/v). The formation of
thinner nanofibers at an increasing ED concentration can be attributed
to the disruption of intramolecular interactions between HP-β-CD
molecules, which facilitates their flow. Further, the appearance of
thinner nanofibers in contrast to urea can be associated with the
conductivity of the respective solutions. Even though the aqueous
solutions of CD containing ED have higher viscosity than the solutions
containing urea, high conductivity may lead to thinner nanofibers
by enhancing electrospinnability.

HP-β-CD nanofibers (c = 160% (w/v)) produced

(w/v), (d) 10% (w/v), (e) 20% (w/v), and (f) 40% (w/v). The insets
show the size distributions of the respective nanofibers.

HFIP, i.e., a fluorinated alcohol, is widely used
as a polar solvent and known for its strongly hydrogen bond-donating
and weakly nucleophilic characters.41 It
has been used as the solvent for dissolving native β-CD molecules
to a large extent and allowed producing electrospun nanofibers from
native β-CD molecules at low concentrations. In this regard,
Akashi and co-workers reported the electrospinning of native β-CD
molecules into well-tuned nanofibers at a very low β-CD concentration
(12.5 wt %).17 In this study, HFIP was
used as an additive, and its influence on the HP-β-CD electrospinning
was explored by the morphological analysis of the resultant nanofibers
(Figure 7). The addition
of HFIP into HP-β-CD solutions led to beaded nanofibers at lower
concentration while bead-free HP-β-CD nanofibers were observed
at the HFIP concentration of 40% (w/v). The mean fiber diameter decreased
from 780 to 580 nm with increasing HFIP concentration from 1 to 40%
(w/v).

(c = 160% (w/v)) produced at various HFIP concentrations:
(a) 1% (w/v), (b) 2.5% (w/v), (c) 5% (w/v), (d) 10% (w/v), (e) 20%
(w/v), and (f) 40% (w/v). The insets show the size distributions of
the respective nanofibers.

Another fluoroalcohol, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), was
also exploited as an additive into aqueous HP-β-CD solutions.
Like HFIP, TFE also forms hydrogen bonding with HP-β-CD molecules.
The addition of TFE at the concentration of 1% (w/v) led to the formation
of thinner HP-β-CD nanofibers (Figure 8), whereas beaded nanofibers were observed
at a concentration of 20% (w/v). This is consistent with the results
of other additives, except MA: first, thinner nanofibers were observed
at the low concentration of additives, whereas beaded nanofibers were
obtained with increasing concentration. The diameter of the respective
nanofibers decreased from 860 to 480 nm with increasing TFE concentration
from 1 to 20% (w/v).

Figure 8 Scanning electron micrographs of the electrospun HP-β-CD
nanofibers (c = 160% (w/v)) produced at four different
TFE concentrations: (a, a′) 1% (w/v), (b, b′) 5% (w/v),
(c, c′) 10% (w/v), and (d, d′) 20% (w/v). The insets
show the size distributions of the respective nanofibers.

The electrospun nanofibers obtained at various
MA concentrations showed completely different morphologies from those
produced using other additives (Figure 9). Increasing MA concentration led to the formation
of larger HP-β-CD nanofibers until a critical MA concentration,
and above this concentration, thinner HP-β-CD nanofibers were
observed: the fiber size increased from 540 to 1430 nm, with an increasing
MA concentration from 2.5 to 20% (w/v). This is in line with the viscosity
data, which revealed a marked rise in the viscosity, followed by a
dramatic decrease. The viscosity of the HP-β-CD solution containing
1 wt % was measured as 0.477 (±0.021) Pa s, while it increased
to 516 (±68) Pa s with a rise of MA concentration to 20 wt %.
The size of electrospun fibers is associated with the solution viscosity,
and generally, increasing viscosity led to the formation of larger
fibers. In this regard, the higher viscosity of HP-β-CD/MA solutions
resulted in larger nanofibers. The formation of larger electrospun
fibers with MA can be attributed to the enhanced intermolecular associations
among CD molecules. The pH of the respective solution was measured
as 11.98, which is high enough for the deprotonation of the hydroxyl
groups of CD molecules. On the other hand, the pH of a HP-β-CD
solution containing 20% (w/v) ED was measured as 11.18. Unlike other
additives, deprotonated CD molecules in the presence of MA may lead
to some physical interactions (i.e., larger fibers). Generally, an
increase in the fiber size can be ascribed to the presence of high-degree
intra- or intermolecular interactions, which drastically increases
apparent molecular weights.42

micrographs of the electrospun HP-β-CD nanofibers (c = 160% (w/v)) produced at various MA concentrations: (a) 2.5% (w/v),
(b) 5% (w/v), (c) 10% (w/v), (d) 20% (w/v), and (e) 40% (w/v). The
insets show the size distribution plots of the nanofibers.

As observed in the viscosity of HP-β-CD solutions,
MA was only the additive that showed an increasing trend in the viscosity
with a concentration rise. Therefore, we investigated the influence
of MA on the electrospinning of HP-β-CD solutions with concentrations
between 80 and 140% (w/v) at the constant MA concentration at 20%
(w/v) (Figure 10).
At 80 and 100% (w/v) HP-β-CD, the electrospraying of HP-β-CD
solution took place, since the concentration was not high enough to
form electrospun nanofibers. At 120% (w/v), discontinuous nanofibers
were observed while increasing HP-β-CD concentration to 140%
(w/v) led to the formation of continuous HP-β-CD nanofibers
with a bead-free structure. Thus, the addition of MA assisted in the
formation of HP-β-CD nanofibers at lower concentration.

are (a) 80% (w/v), (b) 100% (w/v), (c) 120% (w/v), and (d) 140% (w/v).

The influence of hydrogen-bonding
additives on the electrospinning of HP-β-CD molecules at low
concentration (140 wt %) in the presence of 20% (w/v) additive was
investigated. All solutions formed homogeneous mixtures (Figure S7) The electrospinning of the solutions,
except MA, led to beaded fibers, while uniform bead-free fibers were
obtained for MA-containing CD solution (Figure S8). Unlike HFIP, TFE, and urea, the addition of ED tended
to form smoother fibers with a bead-on-string structure. Besides their
influence on the electrospinning of CD molecules, the presence of
hydrogen-bonding additive significantly affects CD-inclusion complexation
and decreases the associations with guest molecules as shown with
CD-acridine complex by the addition of TFE.43

Conclusions
The influence of hydrogen bonding additives on
the electrospinning of HP-β-CD molecules was studied. The addition
of HFIP, ED, MA, TFE, and urea significantly influenced the flow behavior
of the HP-β-CD solutions. The additives, except MA, decreased
the solution viscosity with increasing concentration. On the
other hand, MA was the only additive that could increase the viscosity
of HP-β-CD solutions. The occurrence of hydrogen bonding between
HP-β-CD and additives was evidenced by 1H NMR analysis
with the chemical shift of the HP-β-CD protons, as well as DLS
measurements. As revealed by a viscosity decrease, the additives reduced
the fiber size with increasing concentration and led to the formation
of beaded nanofibers at high concentrations. Unlike HFIP, ED, TFE,
and urea, the addition of MA gave rise to higher viscosity and led
to larger nanofibers, while other additives resulted in thinner nanofibers
due to a decrease in the solution viscosity. MA was the only additive
that could drive the formation of HP-β-CD nanofibers at low
concentrations. The variations in the pH of the solutions also affected
the fiber morphology: the electrospinning of an acidic HP-β-CD
solution (pH = 3) led to beaded nanofibers owing to the disruption
of hydrogen bonds while the electrospinning of an alkaline HP-β-CD
solution (pH = 14) yielded bead-free nanofibers. Overall, this paper
shows that the polymer-free electrospinning of HP-β-CD molecules
is highly sensitive against the presence of hydrogen-bonding additives,
which severely affect the formation of uniform fiber morphology with
respect to their concentrations.

Experimental Section
Materials
Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD, Cavasol W7 HP,
molar substitution per 0.60) was obtained from Wacker Chemie GmbH
(Germany) as a gift sample. Urea (99.8%, Merck), 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol
(TFE (>99%), Sigma-Aldrich), methylamine (MA, 40 wt % solution
in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), ethylenediamine (ED (>99.5%),
Sigma-Aldrich), and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP (≥99%),
Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased and used as received. The electrospinning
solutions were prepared using high-purity water from a Millipore Milli-Q
system.

Electrospinning of Cyclodextrin Solutions
HP-β-CD
was dissolved in water and mixed with an additive molecule, i.e.,
urea, TFE, MA, HFIP, or ED. The electrospinning was carried out at
the HP-β-CD concentration of 160 wt % unless otherwise noted,
and the concentration of additives was given with respect to water
(% w/v). The solutions were mixed and then transferred into 1 mL syringes
having blunt-edged metallic needles (Sterican MIX, 18G × 11/2″,
Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The syringes were placed horizontally
on a syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems, NE-300 “Just Infusion”
Syringe Pump). The flow rate of CD solutions was set to 0.5 mL/h during
the electrospinning, and a high-voltage power supply (Matsusada, AU
series) was used to apply a constant voltage at 15 kV. Randomly oriented
nanofibers were deposited on a grounded stationary rectangular metal
collector, which was covered by a piece of an aluminum foil at a distance
of 15 cm. The electrospinning process was performed at ∼24
°C (±1) in an enclosed Plexiglas chamber. For the electrospinning
at pH values 3 and 14, HP-β-CD molecules were dissolved in 0.001
M HCl (pH = 3) and 1 M NaOH (pH = 14) and thereafter electrospun into
fibers.

Characterization
Viscosity measurements were performed
using an Anton Paar Physica MCR 301 rheometer equipped with a Peltier
device for temperature control. The top plate (cone plate (CP), diameter
(D) 50 mm, 1°) was set at a distance of 104
μm prior to the measurements. A solvent trap system was used
to minimize water evaporation during rheological testing. Further,
the sample perimeter was covered with a low-viscous silicone oil to
prevent water evaporation throughout the measurements. Viscosity experiments
were performed in the shear rate range of 0.01–2000 s–1, and the viscosity at the shear rate (γ) of 0.1 s–1 was taken for comparison. Conductivity measurements were carried
out using a conductivity meter (Mettler Toledo) at room temperature.
The morphology of the electrospun nanofibers was explored by a Quanta
200 FEG, FEI scanning electron microscope (SEM). Prior to SEM analysis,
the fiber samples were sputtered with a thin layer of Au (∼
5 nm), a Gatan 682 Precision Etching and Coating System (PECS). The
average diameter and size distribution of the nanofibers were calculated
over 100 fibers using SEM images by ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

NMR Experiments
1H NMR spectra of the HP-β-CD
molecules in D2O were recorded on a Bruker DPX-400 instrument
at various concentrations of additives. The spectra were recorded
at 400 MHz, and a total of 32 scans were taken.

Dynamic Light
Scattering (DLS) Experiments
The measurements were performed
by a photon correlation spectroscopy using a Malvern Nano ZS ZEN3600
(Malvern Instruments Inc.) at a fixed scattering angle of 173°.
HP-β-CD molecules (20 mg/mL) dissolved in distilled water and
additives with various concentrations were added. Polystyrene cuvettes
were used for the measurements, and the data were analyzed by Zetasizer
software (Malvern).
