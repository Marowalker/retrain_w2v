Semiconducting
colloidal quantum dots (QDs) provide an excellent
platform for nanoscale charge-transfer studies. Because of their size-dependent
optoelectronic properties, which can be tuned via chemical synthesis
and of their versatility in surface ligand exchange, QDs can be coupled
with various types of acceptors to create hybrids with controlled
type (electron or hole), direction, and rate of charge flow, depending
on the foreseen application, either solar harvesting, light emitting,
or biosensing. This perspective highlights several examples of QD-based
hybrids with controllable (tunable) rate of charge transfer obtained
by various approaches, including by changing the QD core size and
shell thickness by colloidal synthesis, by the insertion of molecular
linkers or dielectric spacers between donor and acceptor components.
We also show that subjecting QDs to external factors such as electric
fields and alternate optical excitation energy is another approach
to bias the internal charge transfer between charges photogenerated
in the QD core and QD’s surface charge traps. The perspective
also provides the reader with various examples of how single nanoparticle
spectroscopic studies can help in understanding and quantifying nanoscale
charge transfer with QDs.

1 Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots
(QDs) are an important class of semiconducting
nanomaterials with exciting physical and chemical properties such
as large absorption cross section, high brightness and high photostability,
spectrally narrow and size- and composition-dependent emission spanning
from ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR), easiness of chemical synthesis,
and surface ligand modification.1−10 QDs have been utilized in various applications in biological imaging
and sensing, in optoelectronics including photovoltaics and solid-state
lighting, photocatalysis, and quantum information science.5−29 Following the absorption of light by the QD, an electron–hole
pair is generated inside its core, a neutral quasiparticle known as
exciton. The electron and hole can recombine radiatively, leading
to photon emission, a transition leading to a state called “on”,
as it is associated with the emission of light. The QD can also undergo
photocharging followed by nonradiative Auger recombination when either
of the photogenerated charges is trapped outside the core. In this
case, a trion is formed inside the QD’s core, either negative
(hole trapping) or positive (electron trapping).30−34 The states associated with trions are either “dark
(off)” or “dim (gray)”, whether the trion is
positive or negative.34 Trapping of photogenerated
charges outside a QD’s core has been proposed to relate to
surface defects, including diffusive ones, dangling bonds, or the
presence of external charge acceptors.35−37 The alternation of a
QD emission between “on” and “off” or
“gray” states is known as photoluminescence (PL) blinking
and is therefore regulated by the so-called “internal charge
traps”. When the intended utilization of QDs is to harvest
light such as in photovoltaic solar cells, to generate electroluminescence
like in solid-state lighting or to optically sense a biological event,
colloidal QDs might be coupled with external acceptors like dyes,
carbon nanomaterials, conductive polymers, metal oxides, and so on.12,38−44 In doing so, hybrid QD-based donor–acceptor systems can be
fabricated by band-gap engineering of the QD and of the QD–acceptor
interface.45−57 Band-gap engineering of QDs allows to obtain optimal band alignment
with the acceptor component in order to promote efficient photoinduced
charge transfer.39 Engineering of the donor–acceptor
interface can further improve the efficiency of this process or it
can allow rate tunability. This perspective discusses recent progress
in our ability to impose and control nanoscale charge transfer in
QD-based donor–acceptor hybrids through a variety of approaches,
such as chemical synthesis, click chemistry, optically inert spacer
implantation, the use of an external electric field and of varying
optical excitation energy. These are straightforward approaches to
tune the interfacial charge transfer in the direction one needs for
a particular application, either photovoltaics, sensing, solid-state
lighting, or reversible optical switching.55−61

2 Design of QD-Based Donor–Acceptor Hybrids
with Tunable Charge-Transfer Rate
The kinetics of electron
transfer in QD-based donor–acceptor
hybrids can be described by the Marcus theory for nonadiabatic electron
transfer for weakly coupled systems.62 The
rate of electron transfer, kET, can be
expressed as a function of the driving force (ΔG°), the reorganization energy (λ), and the electronic
coupling strength (V), as shown by 1  In eq 1, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is
the temperature. In general, the driving force for electron transfer
is set by the difference between the values of the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO or conduction band, CB) energy levels of the
donor and acceptor components. In addition, the electronic coupling
strength, V, can be expressed by an exponent-dependent
decay function of the donor–acceptor interspacing, d,63,64 2  where V0 is a
constant and β is a damping factor. A similar equation is used
for characterizing the rate for hole transfer, except to the fact
that the driving force, in this case, is set by the difference between
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO or valence band, VB)
energy levels of the donor and acceptor components. The above molecular
parameters from eq 1 governing
charge transfer, in particular, the energy band difference and the
separation distance between donor and acceptor components, respectively,
provide a strategy to design QD donor–acceptor hybrids for
the study of nanoscale interfacial charge transfer. For example, as
shown herein, colloidal QD synthesis is an elegant method to tune
both electron and hole transfer by varying either the core size or
the shell thickness in core/shell QDs.55,57,59,60,65−67 One other way to tune charge transfer is through
the use of optically inactive spacers linking the donor QD and the
acceptor component, and two examples involving molecular and inorganic
spacers are discussed below.55−57

3 Tunability
of Charge Transfer via Colloidal
Nanocrystal Synthesis
As previously stated, the rate for
charge transfer in QD-based
hybrids can be controlled by band-gap engineering of QDs, precisely
by varying the QD core size. This can be achieved by controlling the
chemical reaction time and/or temperature and the concentrations of
precursors and surfactants.67,68

3.1 Electron
Transfer in Core/Shell Quantum Dot–Bridge–Fullerene
Hybrids
To fabricate donor–acceptor hybrids for charge-transfer
studies, we used a series of water-soluble carboxy-ended core/shell
CdSe/ZnS QDs with core sizes of 2.5, 3.2, and 4.5 nm and similar ZnS
shell thickness, and with corresponding emission colors peaking at
525, 565, and 605 nm, respectively (Figure 1a). We preferred the use of core/shell QDs
with type I band alignment because of their enhanced chemical and
physical stabilities in aqueous solution in which we assembled the
hybrids.69,70 We connected each of these QDs to a water-soluble
fullerene derivative, fullerene-malonic acid hexaadduct (FMH), via
click chemistry using an aminoalkanethiol linker, 16-amino-1-hexadecanethiol
hydrochloride (16AHT), which can connect to the carboxyl group of
the FMH through a standard coupling reaction assisted by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
and to the ZnS shell of the QD with the thiolated end of the 16AHT
linker.60 To control the stoichiometry
in these hybrids, we developed a stepwise surface-based self-assembly
method, which starts with anchoring the FMH and adding the linker
and finally the QD. Due to the difference in size between FMH (1 nm)
and QD (>5 nm including the shell), mostly a single QD couples
to
a thiolated FMH, thus producing a donor–bridge–acceptor
heterodimer. For the 605 nm emitting CdSe/ZnS QD of 4.5 nm, the positions
of the CB and VB are at −4.3 and −6.4 eV,40 while for FMH, the positions of LUMO and HOMO
are at −4.7 and −6.8 eV, respectively.41 This type II energy band alignment (Figure 1a) enables photoinduced charge (electron)
transfer from QD to FMH following optical pumping with blue light
(460 nm), which excites solely the QD (Figure 1b) and with the fullerene known as a strong
electron acceptor (n-type) molecule. For QDs with smaller sizes, the
electron transfer is expected to become stronger due to the increase
in quantum confinement, leading to a higher gap between the CB of
QD and LUMO of FMH. For example, by decreasing the QD core size from
4.5 to 2.5 nm, the CB is expected to be upshifted by around 0.2 eV,40 resulting in an increase of the driving force,
which will lead to increased electron-transfer rate.

of 525 nm (QD525), 565 nm (QD565), and 605 nm (QD605), respectively,
were used to produce heterodimers with varying electron-transfer rate.

Since electron transfer is a quenching process for the photoluminescence
(PL) of the QD as part of the heterodimer, time-resolved PL measurements
can be employed to resolve the quenching rate. The heterodimers from Figure 1 were probed by single
nanocrystal PL spectroscopy measurements where PL lifetimes were measured
from various individual QDs, and related heterodimers and distribution
of PL lifetimes were built (Figure 1c–e) from which mean values were extracted to
compute electron-transfer rates according to 3  with τQD–FMH and τQD mean values for the PL lifetimes of QD–16AHT–FMH
dimer and QD alone, respectively, obtained from the PL histograms
in Figure 1c–e. Figure 1f shows the calculated
electron-transfer rate versus QDs’ core diameter with kET increasing from 2.2 × 107 to 4.9 × 108 s–1 when changing
the QD core from 4.5 nm (QD605) to 2.5 nm (QD525), thus demonstrating
tunability in electron-transfer rate by band-gap engineering of donor
QD.

3.2 Hole Transfer in Core/Shell Quantum Dot–Conductive
Polymer Hybrids
For QD-based donor acceptor hybrids functioning
on photoinduced hole transfer, the rate can also be tuned by the same
approach of band-gap engineering of the QD core.57,71 In the particular example described in ref (57), we assembled negatively
charged carboxyl-ended core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs with a p-type positively
charged conductive polyelectrolyte, poly(9,9′-bis(6-N,N,N-trimethylammoniumhexyl)fluorene-alt-1,4-(2,5-bis(6-N,N,N-trimethylammoniumhexyloxy))phenylene) (FHQ) by
electrostatic interaction, and with FHQ functioning as a hole acceptor
for QDs (Figure 2a).
Using QDs of different sizes but with similar shell thickness and
surface ligand (3-mercaptopropionic acid), with emission peaks at
605 nm (QD605) and 632 nm (QD632), we could change the rate for photoinduced
hole transfer by tuning the valence band energy and therefore the
energy gap between the VB and the HOMO of the accepting polymer FHQ
(Figure 2a). This particular
FHQ polymer absorbs and emits in the UV and blue regions of the spectrum,
respectively (Figure 2b), and by optically pumping a QD–FHQ hybrid at 532 nm, we
could solely photoexcite the QD and observe the hole transfer as a
quenching of the PL emitted by the QD by the nearby FHQ polymer (Figures 2a,b and 3b). Similar to the case of electron transfer, we
performed time-resolved single nanocrystal spectroscopic experiments
on isolated QDs and QD–FHQ hybrids and measured PL lifetimes
from such entities from which we built PL lifetime histograms, as
shown in Figure 2c–f.
From the mean values of the PL lifetimes estimated from Figure 2c–f and using eqs 3 and 4 4  we estimated an increase in hole transfer
rate from 1.1 × 107 to 3.2 × 107 s–1 and in efficiency (EHT) from 20 to 43% when decreasing the QD core size from QD632 to QD605,
which demonstrates the achievement of tunability in hole transfer
through QD band-gap engineering in QD–conductive polymer donor–acceptor
hybrids.

As mentioned before, the surface
passivation of a core-only QD
by a wide band-gap semiconductor can enhance the long-term photostability
of a QD and its photophysical properties such as PL quantum yield
and lifetime. It does this by passivating surface charge traps involved
in the photocharging of the core.1 Coating
a CdSe QD with multiple ZnS shells improves both the PL quantum yield
and the PL lifetime of the neutral exciton and shifts slightly the
emission peak toward lower energies, as can be seen in Table 1.55 At the same time, a wide band-gap shell will act as a tunneling
barrier for any charge-transfer process initiated in the core and
with an external acceptor. With this in mind, we designed and assembled
a series of CdSe/ZnS QD–conductive polyelectrolyte donor–acceptor
hybrids (Figure 3a),
where tunability in the rate for charge (hole) transfer from the CdSe
core to polymer could be achieved by increasing the shell thickness,
from monolayer and up (Table 1).55 As mentioned before in this
paragraph, for these types of hybrids composed of negatively charged
CdSe/ZnS QDs emitting at around 635 nm and a positively charged p-type
conductive polyelectrolyte FHQ absorbing and emitting in the UV–blue
spectral range, photoinduced hole transfer proceeds from the photoexcited
CdSe core onto the p-type polymer (see Figure 3a, and energy band alignment in Figure 3b) and it can be
easily monitored through the PL quenching experienced by the QD in
the presence of polymer, following optical pumping at around 590 nm
where only the QD absorbs.

Data characterizing the hole
transfer in the QD–FHQ hybrids
with varying shell thickness are shown in Figure 3c,d. We measured the hole transfer both in
solution and in thin-film phases. In solution, we blended diluted
QDs (200 nM) in borate buffer with FHQ polymer at different molar
ratios, from 1:0 to 1:20 QD/FHQ (Figure 3c). We observed the strongest PL quenching
at the highest molar ratio and for the thinnest ZnS, where we estimated
an efficiency of EHT = 67%, which suggests
efficient electrostatic binding of positively charged FHQ to the negatively
charged surface of QD. With the increase in shell thickness, we start
to observe the dominant role of the shell as a tunneling barrier as
a decrease in PL quenching even at high molar ratios (1:20 QD/FHQ),
with quenching decreasing to 40% for QD-2/FHQ, 18% for QD-3/FHQ, 11%
for QD-4/FHQ, and 7% for QD-5/FHQ (Figure 3c). PL lifetime measurements of QD-X samples and QD-X/FHQ hybrids performed
using a 590 nm optical pumping can be used in conjunction with eq 3 to compute hole transfer
rates versus ZnS shell thickness for QD-X/FHQ hybrids
in solution (QD/FHQ molar ratio of 1:20) to reveal the shell thickness
dependency of the hole transfer and the increased tunneling character
at thicker shell (Figure 3d, black-colored data), with the strongest rate kHT of about 2.0 × 108 s–1 observed for QD-1/FHQ hybrid, i.e., the QD with the thinnest shell.
For the thickest shell, hole transfer does not proceed at all since
there is no observable quenching. According to eq 1, changes in hole transfer rate in these hybrids
are expected mainly from changes in the electronic coupling strength, V = V0 exp(−βd), since they bear QDs with same size cores such that parameters
like the driving force (ΔG°) and the reorganization
energy (λ) do not change. As such, the hole transfer rate kHT for QD-X/FHQ hybrids will
be sensitive only to changes in donor–acceptor separation distance,
e.g., ZnS shell thickness, ts, and will
be given by kHT = k0 exp(−βts).
A fit of kHT versus ZnS shell thickness
is shown in Figure 3d, black line, with a β ∼ 0.2 Å–1, and it confirms our ability to tune the hole transfer rate through
shell engineering. If the solution of QD-X/FHQ is
spin-casted on a solid support, an increase in hole transfer rate
is observed when compared to the solution case (Figure 3d, red-colored data), with the strongest
rate kHT(QD-1/FHQ) ≈ 4.6 ×
108 s–1 observed for the QD-1/FHQ, the
hybrid with the thinnest shell. Similarly, the hybrid with the thickest
shell does not experience any quenching, suggesting that the tunneling
of the photogenerated hole through the shell and onto the polymer
is not possible anymore at such shell thickness (4.2 nm). The increase
in hole transfer rate from solution to solid thin films was attributed
to a denser packing of the FHQ polymer chains on the QD surface, leading
to increased electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor in
thin film versus solution.

4 Tunability
of Electron Transfer via Optically
Inert Spacers
Click chemistry is a popular tool to couple
various motifs to biological
specimens like proteins and enzymes and has become popular in the
material science field when functionalizing colloidal nanoparticles
for various studies.72 With the help of
click chemistry, we developed a surface-based stepwise assembly method
to create inorganic–bridge–organic heterodimers composed
of colloidal quantum dots as donors and fullerene as acceptors. Details
on the method have been provided in a preceding paragraph and can
also be found in refs (59) and (60) (Figure 1a). Here, we discuss
a specific class of these hybrids, where the bridge, an aminoalkanethiolated
linker, is used to change the separation distance between the donor
and acceptor components to achieve distance-dependent, tunable electron
transfer.59,60 We used linkers of varying lengths to connect
a CdSe/ZnS QD emitting at 605 nm with a water-soluble fullerene (FMH, Figure 4), namely, 6-amino-1-hexanethiol
hydrochloride (6AHT), 11-amino-1-undecanethiol hydrochloride (11AUT),
and 16-amino-1-hexadecanethiol hydrochloride (16AHT). By controlling
the density of hybrids linked to a glass support, we could achieve
concentrations optimal for performing single nanoparticle spectroscopic
studies of distance-dependent electron transfer. We measured PL lifetimes
from individual QD605 nanocrystals on glass support and from QD605–bridge–FMH
hybrids of different bridge lengths and constructed PL lifetime histograms
shown in Figure 4a–d,
and they show progressive advance of both the mean value and the full
width at half-maximum toward smaller values when going from isolated
QDs (Figure 4a) to
QD–FMH hybrids, with the observed values becoming smaller for
shorter linker (Figure 4b–d correspond to 16AHT, 11AUT, and 6AHT linkers, respectively):
20 ns (standard deviation σ ≈ 6.5 ns) for isolated QDs,
5 ns (σ ≈ 6.7 ns) for QD–16AHT–FMH, 3 ns
(σ ≈ 5.9 ns) for QD–11AUT–FMH, and 1 ns
(σ ≈ 4.4 ns) for QD–6AHT–FMH. Computing
electron-transfer rates according to eq 3 leads to Figure 4f, which clearly shows exponential-dependent electron
transfer versus donor–acceptor distance, kET = k0 exp(−βts), with an attenuation coefficient β
∼ 0.1 Å–1. Furthermore, it is observed
that with stronger electron transfer (shorter linker), the standard
deviation for PL lifetime histograms in Figure 4b–d decreases, although each of the
lifetimes contributing to these histograms was calculated in such
a way as to account for similar error (standard deviation).60 In the absence of the linker (Figure 4e), which is for isolated QDs
deposited on a monolayer of FMH molecules, the PL lifetime histogram
is broad, with a mean value close to that of isolated QDs on glass
support. This demonstrates the important function of the aminoalkanethiol
linkers in promoting and controlling the electron transfer in these
hybrids.

Electron transfer of a photoexcited
QD with a strong external acceptor
like fullerene (bare fullerene can accept up to six electrons) affects
its PL blinking by competing with the QD’s internal charge
traps. In the case of this series of QD–linker–FMH hybrids,
we investigated how electron transfer affects the PL blinking of isolated
QDs when part of the hybrid. Isolated QDs on glass support feature
PL blinking in the form of a quasi-two-state level (Figure 4g) with a clear distinction
between the on- and off-levels. QD–linker–FMH hybrids
blink differently, featuring a multistate on/off-blinking behavior
with no clear distinction between the on- and off-states (Figure 4h). Associated PL
intensity histograms built from such PL intensity traces show clear
differences between the two types of blinking, two-state (Figure 4g) and multistate
(Figure 4h). Using
a so-called intensity threshold method,38,59,73−75 traces like those shown in Figure 4g,h can be analyzed
with respect to the times a QD spends in the on-state (probability
of occurrence of on-times, P(ton)) and off-state (probability of occurrence of off-times P(toff)). For isolated QDs on
a glass support, both P(ton) and P(toff) follow
an inverse power-law distribution, which can be modeled by a power-law
model73 5  where b is a constant, and mon and moff are
the power-law exponents for the on- and off-states, respectively.
Fitting parameters are shown in Table 2. For QD–linker–FMH hybrids, P(ton) distributions for hybrids
also display power-law dependency but only at short times. At longer
times, they become exponential such that a more complex model with
a truncated power-law model must be used to model these data for hybrids37,76−78 6  where τ is a crossover
time from the
power-law to exponential dependency. In addition, P(toff) distributions of QD–linker–FMH
hybrids also show deviations from a power-law dependency at longer
times, but these can only be modeled by a stretched exponential bending
tail at long times and next to the power law model for short times 7  From isolated QDs to QD–linker–FMH
hybrids, there is an increase in blinking activity, seen here by an
increase in the value of mon (shorter
on-times), and, at the same time, among the three hybrids, an increase
in mon with increased strength in electron
transfer, i.e., shorter linker (Table 2). An opposite trend is observed for the off-times,
that is, smaller values for moff (longer
off-times) with stronger electron transfer and smaller than those
observed for isolated QDs. These trends clearly reflect the competition
introduced by the electron transfer with external acceptors to the
blinking of the QD which involves internal charge traps.

One other hybrid system involving
QDs and external acceptors we
recently designed and assembled is based on near-infrared (NIR) absorbing/emitting
core/shell PbS/CdS QDs and TiO2 thin film (Figure 5a). The energy band alignment
between PbS core and TiO2 favors photoinduced electron
transfer from PbS QDs into TiO2. This is true, as long
as there is no overlap between the absorption of TiO2 and
the emission of PbS QD so that a competing energy transfer is excluded
(Figure 5b). Similar
to the case of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs, the wide bandgap CdS shell
in the case of core/shell PbS/CdS QDs serves the purpose of a tunneling
barrier for the electron transferring from the PbS core onto TiO2, thus making possible to probe the electron transfer via
PL quenching (the lack of a wide band-gap shell will make the transfer
superefficient, leaving no PL to be detected in the QD–acceptor
hybrid). To demonstrate tunability by an optically inactive spacer,
we introduced a dielectric layer of Al2O3 of
1 nm between the QD and acceptor. From isolated QDs on glass support
to QDs deposited on TiO2 thin film, we observed substantial
quenching, as shown by the PL lifetime histograms of single nanocrystal
lifetimes in Figure 5c,d, on average, 2.24 μs on glass and 1.06 μs on TiO2, which corresponds to a rate for the electron transfer of kET (QD–TiO2) ≈ 4.9×
105 s–1.

The insertion of 1 nm Al2O3 between
the QD
and TiO2 slowed down the quenching, with the PL lifetime
recovering back to 1.5 μs (Figure 5e), which corresponds to a rate for electron
transfer of kET (QD–Al2O3/TiO2) ≈ 2.15 × 105 s–1. As such, tunability in the rate for electron
transfer can be easily demonstrated by the use of donor–acceptor
spacers.

5 Charge Transfer with Internal Traps: Tunability
of Electron Transfer by External Factors
As mentioned at
the beginning of this perspective, an isolated
QD can undergo photocharging followed by efficient nonradiative Auger
recombination when either of the photogenerated charges is trapped
outside the core, by surface defects and/or dangling bonds acting
as traps. We call this charge transfer with internal traps. This charge
transfer followed by charge recombination with the remaining charge
in the core induces an alternation between emissive and nonemissive
states populated by the QD, which, in turn, leads to PL blinking.
In this paragraph, we discuss two examples on how charge transfer
can be reversibly manipulated by external factors affecting internal
charge traps: (i) through the use of an external electric field reversibly
manipulating the energy of the internal trap and (ii) through the
use of low- and high-energy optical pumping, which access different
types of charge traps leading to different dynamics in the emission
of a QD.58,61

5.1 Internal Charge-Transfer
Tunability via an
External Electric Field
The influence of an external electric
field  on the PL emitted by isolated QDs has been
related to the quantum-confined Stark effect and promised as a way
to directly control the optical switching behavior of these nanoparticles
beyond blinking.82−84 To demonstrate our ability to reversibly tune internal
charge transfer in CdSe/ZnS QDs, we incorporated highly diluted QDs
in a capacitor-like architecture with the QDs sandwiched between two
insulating layers of SiO2, and poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA), with the material further sandwiched between two electrodes,
one of indium tin oxide (ITO) and one of aluminum (Figure 6a) so that an  oriented perpendicular to the electrodes
would be present when bias is applied to the device.

QDs without bias (red bars,  = 0) and under bias (green bars,  ≠ 0) for (e) group QD(A) nanocrystals

to a power-law model are also shown. (k) A QD is positioned inside
a capacitor where its internal electric field interacts with an external

We applied a modulated
(triangular) external electric field  to the device and observed
that the PL
intensity and PL lifetime from an isolated QD also become modulated,
with the two molecular parameters strongly correlated. In fact, we
observed two types of behavior under modulated external : isolated QDs that emit with a PL intensity/lifetime
signal following synchronously the modulation (Figure 6c) and isolated QDs that show opposite or
asynchronous response in emitted PL intensity/lifetime (Figure 6d). We next measured PL intensities
and PL lifetimes from isolated QDs under constant bias ( ≠ 0) while maintaining the direction
of the external , and without bias ( = 0). We found that
about 55% of the probed
isolated QDs exhibited a decrease in PL lifetime following applied
bias, on average from 24.3 ns ( = 0) to 20.6 ns ( ≠ 0), and this
was accompanied by
a decrease in PL intensity, and we categorized this population as
QD(A). The remaining 45% of isolated QDs exhibited an increase in
the PL lifetime, on average from 24.7 ns ( = 0) to 27.8 ns ( ≠ 0), which was accompanied by an
increase in PL intensity, and we categorized this population as QD(B).
PL lifetime histograms of these two QD populations under  = 0 and  ≠ 0 are shown
in Figure 6e,f. We
investigated how the
PL blinking dynamics of these two groups is affected by external bias
(Figure 6g–j).
We constructed probability distributions P(ton) and P(toff) using the previously described threshold method and
fit each probability with a power-law model (eq 5). We observed that the two groups responded
differently to the external : group QD(A) exhibited a decrease in on-time
with applied external  (mon changes
from 1.36 at  = 0 to 1.53 at  ≠ 0), while group
QD(B) shows an
increase in on-time with applied external  (mon changes
from 1.56 at  = 0 to 1.29 at  ≠ 0). To explain
these different
behaviors of the two groups with applied bias, we refer the reader
to the cartoon in Figure 6k. We know that QDs have an intrinsic permanent dipole moment
(about 70 D) developed along the nanocrystal’s c axis of the wurtzite crystal structure;85 this dipole moment can generate an internal electric field (int) with a direction along this
same c axis. This int can bias
the energy depth
of the internal trap states associated with blinking, making traps
oriented parallel to the direction of the permanent dipole moment
to become energetically favorable. When applying an external ext to a QD, this can either
increase or decrease the strength of the local field int experienced by the charge
carriers in the trap states. If the QD has a permanent dipole moment
(projection in the x axis) aligned antiparallel to
the ext, an electron will be trapped
easily (increased internal charge-transfer rate) and it will be retained
longer in the trap state (deep trap), a manifestation seen as a decrease
in the on-time probability (increase of mon), such as observed in group QD(A), whereas group QD(B) includes
QDs with a permanent dipole moment (projection in the x axis) aligned parallel with the ext and exhibits
an increase
in on-time blinking (decrease in mon),
as we saw in Figure 6i. In consequence, we demonstrate the ability to reversibly control
the PL emitted by a QD with an external electric field, which biases
the internal charge-transfer process associated with blinking.

5.2 Internal Charge-Transfer Tunability via Optical
Excitation
One other approach to reversibly alter the internal
charge-transfer process of a QD with its surface traps is to change
the photon excitation energy. Near-infrared absorbing and emitting
PbS/CdS QDs blink differently under different optical excitation energies,
whether cold or hot excitons (electron–hole pairs) are produced
following a particular optical excitation. For example, 633 nm is
a low energy optical excitation, just above the band-gap edge of the
QD, thus producing cold excitons, while 488 nm is a high energy optical
excitation producing hot excitons.61 In Figure 7a–c, we show
that the PL blinking of an isolated PbS/CdS QD emitting at around
900 nm switches reversibly from a classic telegraph-like blinking
under 633 nm excitation (low energy) to a multistate blinking under
488 nm excitation (high energy).86 Changing
the excitation back to 633 nm (low energy) restores the two-state
telegraph-like blinking behavior. This effect can be captured also
by analyzing the probabilities P(ton) and P(toff) of isolated QDs obtained with 633 and 488 nm optical excitations,
respectively (Figure 7d,e). For P(ton), power-law
fits with eq 5 reveal
that mon increased from 1.62 at 633 nm
excitation to 1.86 at 488 nm excitation. Such an increase points toward
an increase in blinking activity, which accounts for a decrease in
on-time. For P(toff),
fits according to eq 6, a modified power-law model, including an exponential tail-off,
renders power-law exponents and crossover times moff = 1.52 and τ = 20.5 s for 633 nm excitation
and moff = 1.30 and τ = 2.4 s for
488 nm excitation. This suggests an increase in the off-time from
633 to 488 nm excitation. These changes in blinking dynamics are similar
to those observed for the CdSe/ZnS–linker–FMH hybrid,
where a QD is connected with an external electron acceptor59 (see section 4).

Figure 7f,g
provides
a mechanistic explanation for the reversible changes observed with
alternating low-energy (633 nm) and high-energy (488 nm) optical excitations.61,76,87−90 In Figure 7f, a cold exciton is formed following excitation
above the band-gap edge, which can recombine radiatively to emit from
the band-gap edge state or it can connect nonradiatively with QD’s
surface traps, leading to two-state on/off blinking (Figure 7a). In Figure 7g, high-excitation energy produces hot excitons,
which can either cool down to the band-gap edge state, where they
can recombine and emit photons or they can cross over through a transition
state and populate defect states from which radiative recombination
can occur and additional trap states can be accessed (Figure 7g, the right part depicted
in blue). This crossover leads to an increase in blinking activity
and results in multistate emission. Therefore, by changing the optical
excitation energy, we can tune internal charge transfer with different
defect states within an isolated QD.

6 Conclusions
and Outlook
In this perspective, we presented a variety of
synthetic and experimental
approaches to control the nanoscale charge transfer in colloidal quantum
dot hybrids, most of them originating from modifications of molecular
parameters defining the rate of the process in the well-known theory
of Marcus for nonadiabatic electron transfer for weakly coupled systems.
We have shown that colloidal nanocrystal synthesis, in particular,
both core and shell engineering, can provide elegant ways to control
the driving force and the electronic coupling strength for either
electron or hole transfer. We have shown that optically inactive donor–acceptor
spacers such as alkane-based linkers and dielectric nanomaterials
can be used to tune the rate of charge transfer. Besides charge transfer
with external acceptors, we have provided two examples where we could
reversibly tune internal charge transfer between QD’s core
and
surface traps with the help of external electric fields and alternating
optical excitation energy. The progress gained from these QD hybrids
functioning on charge transfer can provide useful information for
the design of active materials for next-generation high-efficient
optoelectronics, sensors, and quantum materials. One can envision
combining QDs with semiconducting nanowires in creating 0D–1D
hybrids such as QDs with TiO2 and with ZnO nanowires for
photocatalytic activities or QDs with 2D materials like graphene or
transition-metal dichalcogenides for improved solar cell, solid-state
lighting, and energy storage applications. The replacement of “toxic”
colloidal QDs with more environmentally friendly InP and CuInS2 QDs can produce hybrids for the large market of biological
and medical sensing which function on nanoscale charge transfer. We
believe that the progress gained from our charge-transfer studies
of QD-hybrid systems can provide useful insights into the design,
control, and optimization of novel QD-based hybrids and related devices.
