Anthocyanins are
plant secondary metabolites that, despite their
chemical instability, have found many applications as natural food
colorants. They are also known for their beneficial health effects
because of their antioxidant and anticancer properties. More stable
versions of these molecules, particularly at neutral pH conditions,
are required to study the anthocyanin pharmacokinetic properties and
obtain effective therapeutic results. In the present report, a cost-effective
technique was developed to prepare the deuterated anthocyanin using
recombinant Escherichia coli as a production
host and deuterated glycerol and D2O in the culture media.
This approach resulted in the formation of endogenous deuterated uridine
5′-diphosphate-glucose that was further incorporated by the
recombinant anthocyanin pathway, resulting in the formation of deuterated
cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (C3G). The deuterium exchange
of O–D and C–D were studied by liquid chromatography
(LC)–mass spectrometry and NMR analysis. The labeled C3G, purified
by high-performance LC showed a stable nature at pH 7.0 as compared
to nondeuterated C3G.

==== Body
Introduction
Anthocyanins are a
group of plant natural products and dietary
polyphenols that are responsible, to a large extent, for the red color
in fruits, vegetables, flowers, and red wine.1 Among these natural products, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside
(C3G) is one of the most prevalent anthocyanins in nature. Because
of the increasing preference for natural food colorants, anthocyanins
in general and C3G in particular have received considerable attention
in recent years as candidates for replacing artificial food colorants
and cosmetic additives.2−5 In addition, C3G has gained attention for its potential therapeutic
role related to its neuroprotective effects, including protection
against amyloid-β-peptide-induced toxicity,6 antioxidant and cognitive promotion activity,7 anti-ischemic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory
properties.8,9

Because of their promising therapeutic
potential, various pharmacokinetic
studies have focused on analyzing the signaling mechanisms of anthocyanins
such as C3G in vital organs.10−12 Unfortunately, the disappearance
of C3G in the blood stream is very fast owing to its rapid biotransformation
and its chemical instability at normal pH.10 As a result, there is considerable interest in using more stable
anthocyanins, such as deuterated anthocyanin derivatives. The biological
effect of deuterium (2H), with twice the mass of a hydrogen
atom, has been extensively studied. Deuterium–carbon bonds
are generally about six to 10 times more stable than the corresponding
hydrogen–carbon bonds. As a result, they demonstrate slower
rates of bond cleavage. The presence of deuterium also results in
a kinetic isotope effect,13 which has been
used to slow the metabolism of drugs when they reach vital organs
and get metabolized through C–H bond breaking. One or more
well-placed deuterium can actually have a significant effect on how
long a drug will circulate in the bloodstream, by slowing down its
clearance. Deuterated compounds also can provide critical insights
into the pharmacokinetic properties of molecules.14

As current methods of anthocyanin production rely
on extraction
from plant sources, they are not amenable to modifications that can
allow the facile production of non-natural anthocyanin derivatives,
such as deuterated anthocyanins. However, in the recent past, microbial
production of recombinant anthocyanins has emerged as an attractive
alternative and more flexible production method, especially using
well-characterized microbial hosts such as Escherichia
coli.15 In our laboratory,
we have reconstituted the metabolic pathways leading to the biosynthesis
of various anthocyanins, including C3G, from flavan-3-ol precursors
as well as glucose.16,17 We have shown that recombinant E. coli expressing anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) are
able to convert the cheap and abundant precursor (+)-catechin into
the unstable compound cyanidin, which can be significantly stabilized
by glycosylation with uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose:
3-O-glycosyltransferase (3GT) to form C3G (Figure 1). In this work,
we describe the biosynthesis of deuterated C3G through recombinant E. coli as a production host by supplementing deuterated
glycerol and deuterated water into the culture media (Figure 1). This is the first time the
synthesis of a deuterated anthocyanin molecule has been reported,
opening the possibility of synthesizing not only other deuterated
anthocyanin molecules but also, more generally, deuterated polyphenols.

Figure 1 Schematic
illustration of the biosynthesis of deuterated C3G by
an engineered E. coli strain expressing
ANS and flavonoid 3-glucosyltransferase (3GT) in this study. Deuterated
glycerol and D2O were used to support cell growth and to
supply deuterated UDP-glucose, which provided the deuterated glucosyl
group in the deuterated C3G. Regular catechin was employed as the
substrate for the formation of the tricyclic structure in the deuterated
C3G. The −OH group in the tricyclic structure can be exchanged
with the deuterated hydroxyl (−OD) of D2O in the
medium.

Results and Discussion
Comparison of Glucose and
Glycerol as Carbon Sources in C3G
Fermentation
Glucose is the most widely utilized carbon source
in industrial E. coli fermentations,18 but the excess glucose supplementation under
aerobic conditions causes the formation of acidic byproducts by E. coli, the most common of which is acetate.19,20 Alternatively, glycerol can serve as an excellent carbon source
despite the fact that it is a more energy-poor carbon source, and
is a better source to produce regular and deuterated C3G and has increased
importance in industrial biotechnology.21,22E. coli can utilize glucose and glycerol as carbon
sources to produce destination compounds. Previously, our lab reported
the production of flavan-3-ols using recombinant E.
coli cocultures with different ratios of glycerol
and glucose as a carbon source.23 In that
work, increasing the glycerol percentage in the fermentation medium
resulted in a shift in the production landscape toward higher titers
appearing at later induction points. However, the effects of glycerol
on C3G production by E. coli have not
been tested so far, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, in the
present study, to select a better carbon source for C3G production,
we decided to compare the C3G production by recombinant E. coli in the presence of both glucose and glycerol.

The growth of the C3G-producing strain was slower on glycerol-supplemented
media than glucose (Figure S1). The recombinant
strain reached the midlog phase (OD600 ≈ 3.7) in
22 h after the start of the fermentation when grown in glycerol-supplemented
media (Figure S1c), whereas it reached
the same growth stage faster (17 h, OD600 ≈ 3.5)
in glucose-supplemented media (Figure S1b). This difference may be due to the incorporation of glycerol into
the central metabolism as dihydroxyacetone phosphate that can participate
in both gluconeogenic and glycolytic processes.24 Growth on glycerol resulted in a decrease of specific growth
rate and low level of acetate production.25 The induction time points with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) were also optimized for different cell dilutions separately
in each glucose- and glycerol-supplemented Aspergillus minimal medium (AMM) [3.5 g/L KH2PO4, 5.0
g/L K2HPO4, 3.5 g/L (NH4)2HPO4, 100 mL 10× 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid) (MOPS) mix (83.72 g/L MOPS, 7.17 g/L tricine, 28 mg/L FeSO4·7H2O, 29.2 g/L NaCl, 5.1 g/L NH4Cl, 1.1 g/L MgCl2, 0.48 g/L K2SO4, and 0.2 mL micronutrient stock), 1 mL 1 M MgSO4, 0.1
mL 1 M CaCl2, and 1 mL 0.5 g/L thiamine HCl. Micronutrient
stock contains 0.18 g/L (NH4)6Mo7O24, 1.24 g/L H3BO3, 0.12 g/L CuSO4, 0.8 g/L MnCl2, and 0.14 g/L ZnSO4,
supplemented with 20% (w/v) glucose or glycerol with ampicillin] (Figure 2c,d). The objective
of optimization was to achieve the maximum C3G titer by optimizing
induction time points and sampling conditions. In glucose-supplemented
media, the cells were induced at 15, 16, and 17 h after subculturing
and sampling was done 18 and 24 h after induction. Induction at 16
h after subculturing resulted in maximum C3G production followed by
17 and 15 h time points. Overall, the cells with dilutions of 1200
and 1600 showed better results than lower dilutions. The highest titer
achieved was 44.98 mg/L, at OD600 ≈ 2.8 with induction
at 16 h after inoculation, and sampled 24 h following induction (Figure 2c).

at 18 and 24 h in glucose-supplemented media (c) and glycerol-supplemented
media (d). The values are average of three replicates. Error bars
represent standard deviation.

In glycerol-supplemented media, the cultures were induced
at later
induction time points, that is, 17, 18, and 19 h at different cell
dilutions (Figure 2d). The induction at 19 h after subculturing showed enhanced production
of C3G at 800 and 1600 dilutions. Sampling at 18 h after induction
proved to be better than 24 h sampling. The highest titer of C3G was
obtained with glycerol as the sole carbon source and was 90.95 mg/L
at OD600 ≈ 3.7 by inducing the recombinant C3G pathway
19 h after inoculation, and sampled 18 h after induction (Figure 2d).

The better
C3G production in low-cost glycerol-supplemented media
than glucose-supplemented media allowed us to continue with the production
of deuterated anthocyanins by using deuterated glycerol as the carbon
source in the medium.

Deuterium-Labeled C3G Production
The deuterium-labeled
C3G production was carried out in AMM where normal water and normal
glycerol were replaced by deuterated water (D2O) and deuterated
glycerol-d8. Liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis showed the different probabilities
of deuterium incorporation to the C3G compound in the culture supernatant
(Figure 3b), whereas
no deuteration was found in C3G produced in normal medium (Figure 3a). The highest probability
of deuterium incorporation to C3G was of 10 atoms of deuterium (mass
459) followed by nine atoms of deuterium (mass 458) (Figure 3b). The MS/MS spectrum of the
selected peak clearly confirmed most of the deuterium incorporation
in the glucose residue of C3G, which is consistent with the preliminary
design that deuterium in deuterated glycerol will be incorporated
into UDP-glucose and delivered into the glucose residue in deuterated
C3G, as regular catechin was used as the precursor for the formation
of the tricyclic structure of C3G. Thus, the deuterated hydrogens
in deuterated C3G are mainly located in the glycosyl group. The deuterium
was also incorporated into the tricyclic ring, which was possibly
ascribed to the deuterium–hydrogen exchange in the presence
of D2O.

of anthocyanidin
glucoside; (a) nondeuterated sample; (b) deuterated sample; (b1,b2)
MSMS ESI of the selected peak after losing glucoside residue shows
different possibilities of deuteration in the aromatic ring.

For structural determination of
deuterated C3G, NMR analysis was
performed. Deuterated C3G was purified from the crude sample using
high-performance LC (HPLC) (Figure S2)
and subject to NMR analysis. Treating regular anthocyanins with 1%
DCl in 500 μL MeOD-d4 for 1 h, the
subsequent 1H NMR spectrum was exactly matched with the
commercial C3G anthocyanin standard (Figure S3). This control experiment demonstrated that hydrogen–deuterium
exchange on the carbon atoms from glucose residue of anthocyanins
did not occur under the fermentation conditions. Characterization
of the purified deuterated anthocyanins and regular anthocyanins by
NMR spectroscopy is presented in Figure 4. Peaks at 5.0–7.5 ppm (denoted with
a bracket) in both spectra correspond to aromatic protons on anthocyanins
and are exactly matched, indicating that no hydrogen–deuterium
exchange occurred on the aromatic ring. Peaks at 1.8–4.0 ppm
(denoted in dashed boxes) in panel (a) correspond to protons of carbon
atoms from glucose residue, such as peak at 3.8 ppm that corresponds
to glucose-anomeric hydrogen, but did not show up in panel (b), demonstrating
that hydrogen–deuterium exchange happened on glucose residue.
This technique is very promising to produce labeled anthocyanins having
a much stronger C–D bond, the content of which can be measured
in the tissues during pharmacokinetic studies using heteronuclear
NMR.

and deuterated anthocyanins (b). Peaks at 5.0–7.5 ppm (denoted

anthocyanins and are exactly matched. Peaks at 1.8–4.0 ppm
(denoted in dashed boxes) in panel A correspond to protons from glucose
residue but did not show up in panel B, demonstrating that deuterated
exchange happened on glucose residue.

Stability Analysis of Deuterated C3G
At normal pH,
anthocyanins are highly unstable molecules that are susceptible to
degradation in response to different environmental factors such as
oxygen, temperature, and light.26 Anthocyanins
are more stable at acidic pH (1–3). In aqueous solutions at
pH > 4, anthocyanins adopt the form of carbinol and chalcones that
undergo degradation easily and produce phenolic acids.27 The degradation of anthocyanins at normal pH
is an important factor that can influence their therapeutic properties,
given that the pH of the human blood is around 7.3 and at 7.3.10 More generally, it plays a critical role in
determining the application of these molecules in the food industry
as natural food colorants. Therefore, it was necessary to test the
stability of the produced deuterated C3G at normal pH.

The pH
stability test of deuterated and nondeuterated C3G was performed at
pH 7.0 and showed a more stable nature for deuterated C3G as compared
to normal C3G at room temperature (Figure 5). The sample analysis by HPLC at regular
intervals showed more decrease in residual percentage of regular C3G
(from 100 at 0 h to 21.2% at 72 h) as compared to deuterated C3G (from
100 at 0 h to 71% at 72 h).

Figure 5 Stability comparison between regular C3G (blue
line) and deuterated
C3G (red line) at different intervals of time (from 0 to 72 h) at
pH 7.4, demonstrating early fall for regular C3G as compared to deuterated
C3G.

The improved stability of deuterated
C3G will result in longer
residence times of this molecule in the human body, possibly resulting
in increased absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in
clinical trials. We envision that deuterated C3G can be used to better
study the fate of anthocyanins in human bodies and to investigate
their interaction with human cells.

Conclusions
In
the present study, recombinant E. coli was used to convert deuterated glycerol and D2O to deuterated
UDP-glucose that was incorporated into the deuterated C3G by the last
step in the biosynthetic pathway, catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase
3GT. The biosynthesis process presented in this work is benign and
cost-effective. Therefore, recombinant E. coli strains can provide a very convenient and effective approach to
synthesizing deuterated C3G, which only requires simple deuterated
glycerol and D2O in the fermentation medium. Such deuterated
anthocyanins can be used in the future in pharmacokinetic studies
in animal models. Moreover, this technique can also be applied for
the production of other deuterated anthocyanins using engineered E. coli incorporated with other anthocyanins producing
genes.

Materials and Methods
Strains and Chemicals
E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study were
constructed previously
in our lab,16 and are available through
Addgene (plasmids #86901–86917). The culture media and other
chemicals, viz., LC–MS grade methanol, water, formic acid,
MeOD-d4 (99.9%), deuterated glycerol-d8 (99%), and deuterium chloride (99 atom % D),
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Bacterial Culture Conditions
and Growth Curve
All anthocyanin
production experiments were performed using a recombinant E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) carrying plasmid pETM6-At3GT-m-PhANS
where a two-step anthocyanin pathway has been introduced in monocistronic
configuration.16 The working culture was
maintained on Luria–Bertani agar plates supplemented with 80
μg/mL ampicillin. All growth as well as production experiments
were performed in 1 mL AMM as described previously in polypropylene
deep 48-well plates (5 mL, VWR) covered with breathable rayon film
(VWR). Casamino acids were excluded as they are a potential carbon
source.17,28 For carrying out experiments in deuterated
media, buffer salts and mineral salts were pre-equilibrated with 99.9%
D2O and then flash-evaporated/lyophilized to dryness to
remove exchangeable hydrogen atoms. The exchanged salts were then
dissolved in 99.9% D2O and filter-sterilized. Deuterated
glycerol-d8 (20 g/L) was used as a carbon
source.

For obtaining a bacterial growth curve, glycerol stocks
of recombinant BL21 Star (DE3) strains carrying anthocyanin pathway
plasmids were grown on solid media and after overnight growth, a single
colony was inoculated into a single well of a polypropylene deep 48-well
plate containing 1 mL of liquid media. The plate was then incubated
at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm. Optical cell density was measured
on a BioTek Synergy 4 Microplate Reader.

Optimization of Induction
Time Points
For induction
time point optimization in glucose-supplemented media after 17 h of
overnight growth, 400-, 600-, 800-, 1200-, and 1600-fold dilutions
were made, whereas for glycerol-supplemented media after 22 h of overnight
growth, 200-, 300-, 400-, 600-, 800-, 1200-, and 1600-fold dilutions
were made. All cultures were incubated at 225 rpm and 30 °C.
Substrate (1 g/L (+)-catechin final concentration) stock dissolved
in dimethylformamide/ethanol (8:2, v/v) and inducer (1 mM IPTG final
concentration) was added sequentially by multichannel pipette at different
time points after subculturing. These time points were 15, 16,, 17
h for glucose (Figure 2a) and 16, 17, 18, and 19 h for glycerol-supplemented media (Figure 2b). Cultures were
sampled for anthocyanin quantification at 18 and 24 h postinduction.
All production experiments were performed in biological triplicate,
and reported production values represent mean and standard error of
the mean as quantified by HPLC.

HPLC Analysis and Purification
The 200 μL of
cell culture was extracted by addition of an equal volume of acidified
methanol (1% HCl, v/v), followed by brief vortexing and centrifugation
at 21 000g for 10 min. C3G stock solutions of known
concentrations were prepared by dissolving analytical standards (purchased
from Extrasynthese) in dimethyl sulfoxide and were stored at −20
°C. Standard curves for quantifying the anthocyanidin glucoside
production were prepared by dilution of C3G into methanol at appropriate
concentrations. The samples or standards (10 μL) were injected
for analysis on an Agilent 200 series HPLC equipped with a ZORBAX
SB-C18 StableBond analytical column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm)
and a diode array detector. Acetonitrile (solvent A) and water (solvent
B), both containing 0.1% formic acid, were used as mobile phases.
A flow rate of 1 mL/min was used with the following gradients: 10–40%
A (0–10 min) and 10–40% A (10–15 min). C3G was
quantified at a retention time of 4.8 min against the standard curves
by peak area integration at 520 nm.

Anthocyanins were purified
from substrate catechin as well as other components of media using
HPLC with 60 μL injection volume. The separation was conducted
using mobile phases A and B as defined above, at a flow rate of 1
mL/min with the following gradients: 1.0–15% A (0–45
min), 15–60% A (45–50 min), 60–1.0% (50–52
min), and 1% A (52–55 min).

LC–MS Analysis
LC analysis was performed by
injecting 5 μL of the sample to the Agilent 1200 HPLC system
with column Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 4.6 × 150 mm 5 μm.
Water and acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid were used as solvents
A and B, respectively, at a flow rate of 250 μL/min, using the
following gradients: 5–10% B (0–1 min), 10–30%
B (1–10 min), 30–90% B (10–30 min), 90–5%
B (34.9–35 min), and 5% B (35–40 min). MS analysis was
done using LTQ Orbitrap XL from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara,
CA, USA), electrospray ionization (ESI), positive-ion mode, resolution
30 000, and mass accuracy 3 ppm.

NMR Analysis
All
samples were dissolved in 0.5 mL of
MeOD-d4 (contains 1% DCl). 1H spectra were performed at 298 K on a Bruker 800 MHz instrument
recorded for 32 scans with TopSpin 2.1.6 software.

Stability Test
of Deuterated Anthocyanins
The purified
deuterated C3G or regular C3G (Alkemist Labs, USA) was dissolved in
phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) with an initial concentration of
∼20 mg/L and was left at room temperature in the dark for 72
h. Samples were taken periodically and the residual C3G was measured
by HPLC.
