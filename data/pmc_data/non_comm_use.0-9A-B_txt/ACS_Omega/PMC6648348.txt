A new protocol for ring-closing metathesis/isomerization
sequence
was developed. The reactions of selected dienes were performed in
overheated 2-methyltetrahydrofuran at 120 °C and provided a wide
range of cyclic vinyl ethers and amides with good yields and selectivities.
Computational analysis suggests that the relative yield of products
depends on a thermodynamically driven process on the basis of relative
stabilities of isomers.

1 Introduction
For
many years, the olefin metathesis (OM) reaction has been appearing
as an elegant and convenient methodology for carbon–carbon
double bond formation commonly used in chemical laboratories all over
the world1,2 and more and more frequently in industry.3 With the introduction of well-defined complexes,
especially the second generation ones (Figure 1), its popularity has further increased.
This transformation is easy to maintain, the majority of metathesis
reactions are run under mild conditions, often at room temperature,
and the catalysts used exhibit high tolerance to a wide range of functional
groups. Both these factors enable the use of OM in the final stages
in numerous total syntheses.4−7 Moreover, considering the high atom economy, as usually
the only by-product is ethylene or other short alkenes, and the increasing
tendency to utilize green solvents (e.g., dimethyl carbonate,8−10 cyclopentyl methyl ether,11 ethyl acetate,11,12 2-methyltatrahydrofuran,13,14 or water15,16), which replace the traditionally applied toluene or chlorinated
solvents (some of which are or will soon be abolished),17 OM is recognized as a green technology, which
suits perfectly the principles of circular economy.18

Figure 1 Selected commercially available second-generation catalysts.

In addition, OM is often one of
the key steps in tandem catalytic
reactions,19−21 including assisted tandem catalysis. In this process,
the ruthenium catalyst utilized in the metathetical step upon treatment
with so-called trigger is transformed into a complex catalyzing a
subsequent non-metathetical reaction. One example of such process
is the metathesis/isomerization sequence. Double bond isomerization,
for many years treated as an undesired side reaction, has traditionally
been attributed to the formation of ruthenium hydrides,22 although recent studies indicate that also other
ruthenium species such as nanoparticles23 or dimers24 may also be responsible for
this by-process. Because the ruthenium species responsible for the
double bond isomerization differ in structure and origin,25 it was of key importance to find the conditions
under which C–C bond migration will be induced at a certain
moment in the sequence after full completion of the metathesis reaction
and will not be competing with the latter process. Pioneering research
on this methodology was performed by Snapper et al.26 Upon treatment with molecular hydrogen, cyclic allyl ethers
obtained in ring-closing metathesis (RCM) were transformed into their
corresponding vinyl isomers. To avoid a competing hydrogenation reaction,
hydrogen was utilized as a mixture with nitrogen (95:5 N2/H2). At the same time, Schmidt and co-workers conducted
research on the application of different additives converting the
metathesis catalyst into the corresponding ruthenium hydrides. Depending
on the reaction, they utilized NaOH/i-PrOH,27−29 NaBH4 or NaH,29−31 ethyl vinyl ether,32 and triethylsilane/toluene33 systems at elevated temperatures. The used methodology
enabled preparation of cyclic vinyl ethers, in which direct synthesis
in metathesis reactions is problematic because of the readiness of
the alkylidene species formed in the catalytic cycle for decomposition
to the long-lived hydride complexes.34,35 The metathesis/isomerization
sequence was exploited, for example, in the synthesis of centrolobine
derivatives.36,37 Reactions leading to cyclic vinyl
ethers,38,39 amines,39,40 and lactams,39,41,42 whereby double bond migration
was induced by simple heating of the reaction mixture without any
chemical triggers, are also possible. However, in most cases, utilization
of specially prepared substrates was crucial to achieve satisfactory
yields.38,39 When allylic alcohol is used as one of the
substrates in sequence metathesis/isomerization, the resulted enol
is rapidly tautomerized to its saturated carbonyl compound.43−45 In these cases, the isomerization step was induced thermally.

Herein, we examine the influence of different solvents, traditional
and “green”, and the reaction conditions on the yield
and selectivity of metathesis/isomerization sequences using both experimental
and computational methods.

2 Results and Discussion
To investigate how different reaction conditions (solvent, concentration,
temperature) affect the tandem metathesis/isomerization (Scheme 1), a series of substrates
belonging to different classes of compounds like allylic ethers, N,N-diallyltosylamides, N,N-diallylamides, and C,C-diallyl hydrocarbons, have been studied (Figure 2).

hydrocarbons.

Scheme 1 Tandem RCM/Isomerization
In the first attempt, a number
of substrates were reacted with
the nitro analogue of Hoveyda–Grubbs second-generation catalyst
(Gre II, loading 0.25–2.5 mol %) under the conditions
previously reported in the literature,11 namely, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, which is a green solvent utilized
in a number of organic reactions, including the pharmaceutical industry,46 at 80 °C for 4 h (Table 1).

With the exception of anthrone derivative 10a, the
conversion of all substrates was complete, but at the same time, significant
differences in the effectiveness of the subsequent isomerization reaction
were observed. Thus, when 1-(allyloxy)-1-vinylcyclohexane (1a) was used, almost exclusively product of RCM, 1b was
observed regardless of catalyst loading (Table 1, entries 1–3). When 3-(allyloxy)oct-1-ene
(2a) was used, the compound with a structure similar
to 1a but without a spirocyclic motif, the corresponding
vinyl ether 2c was obtained quantitatively in the presence
of an enlarged amount of catalyst. Such a dramatic difference in the
reactivities of these two allylic ethers may be related to steric
hindrance elicited by the strained spiro system. Similar differences
in subsequent isomerization were observed for derivatives of allylic
tosylamides and amides. For example, in the case of N,N-diallyltosylamide (4a) (Table 1, entry 6), almost
quantitative conversions to a product with a shifted double bond were
observed, whereas for N,N-bisallylamide
derivatives, this subsequent process was noticeably less effective
(Table 1, entries 7,
10, 12, and 14). Moreover, in the reaction of N,N-diallyl-2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2-oxoacetamide (9a), because of its low solubility even in boiling 2-methyltetrahydrofuran,
higher dilutions were necessary to obtain improved isomerization yield
(Table 1, entries 14–16).
Of note, in all cases, an increased catalyst amount resulted in improved
isomerization efficiency. This fact suggests a rather low stability
of isomerization active species. Furthermore, when the substrates
without heteroatoms in close proximity to the double bonds were subjected
to the metathesis/isomerization sequence (Table 1, entries 18 and 19), mostly the products
of the RCM reaction were observed, with as little as 30 or 2% (for 10a and 11a, respectively) of the product with
a shifted double bond. A possible explanation for limited isomerization
in the case of carbocyclic compounds based on quantum-mechanical calculations
is provided below.

Next, the influence of different solvents
on the effectiveness
of the isomerization step was studied. For this purpose, toluene,
typically used in a number of OM reactions, and ethyl acetate, one
of the so-called green solvent, were compared with previously used
2-methyltetrahydrofuran (Table 2).

As shown in Table 2, in all examined solvents, the OM reaction proceeded
with the same
effectiveness, as quantitative conversions of all substrates were
observed. On the contrary, differences in promoting the subsequent
isomerization reaction were clearly visible. In toluene, only the
minor double bond migration in the range of 5–6% was observed
(Table 2, entries 3,
6, and 9). When ethyl acetate was utilized, a slight improvement in
isomerization process was noted. The highest level of isomerization,
but still unsatisfactory, was achieved in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran,
which was used for further studies.

Because the reaction conditions
studied so far have not sufficiently
favored the metathesis/isomerization sequence, the temperature of
the process was increased and the reaction time was extended to shift
the reaction equilibrium in favor of the desired products Xc (Table 3). As the
selected process temperature was higher than the boiling point of
2-MeTHF (120 and 80.2 °C, respectively), the reactions were carried
out in pressure ampoules.

c c = 0.05 M.

As expected,
the significant increase of the reaction temperature
and the extension of its time shifted the equilibrium almost exclusively
toward the isomerized products Xc. For practical usefulness,
the quantitative yield in a metathesis/isomerization sequence is crucial.
This is due to the very similar polarity of the metathesis Xb and the subsequent isomerization Xc products, which
would make the application of standard purification techniques troublesome.
To achieve that goal, high catalyst loadings, up to 10 mol %, were
required in some cases, as in the transformation of 5a (Table 3, entries
4–6).

What is important, under the new chemical additive
free conditions,
it was also possible to obtain products containing 6- (5c) and 7-membered (3c) rings, which was a major challenge
in earlier studies by Schmidt.32 Unfortunately,
despite the use of these improved reaction conditions, satisfactory
yields were not obtained for the carbocyclic systems (substrates 10a and 11a, Table 3, entries 13 and 14). This is probably related
to the absence of a heteroatom in the resulting ring, thereby the
lack of coupling resulting from double bond isomerization, as is the
case for other heteroatom-containing substrates.

2.1 Ab Initio
Studies
To gain better
insight into the experimental selectivity patterns, we performed theoretical
calculations using the DFT and DLPNO-CCSD(T) approach for the RCM/isomerization
in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran at 120 °C and high catalyst loadings.
Because the reactions were run for a relatively long time and in high
temperatures, we assumed that the selectivity is a thermodynamically
driven process and assessed the relative stabilities of isomers b and c. The results of the differences in Gibbs
free energies for substrates 1–11 translated into
relative concentrations using Boltzmann distributions are presented
in Table 4 and show
very good agreement with experimental data from Table 3. In most cases, the isomerized product is
energetically more favorable than the metathesis product by 2–4
kcal/mol, yielding more than 90% of this product in the final solution.
There are, however, instances where the computational results are
not in good agreement with the experimental data. This is true for 3 and 7, for which the computational estimates
of Xb:Xc are 36:64 and 26:74, respectively,
but in the experiment, the product of isomerization was obtained in
more than 90% yield. There is also one instance (11)
where the experimental yield of Xb:Xc of 96:4 is way
off the computational estimate of 60:40. At this point, we do not
have a good explanation to this discrepancy, though it is worth noting
that the accuracy of our calculations is not better than 1 kcal/mol
and a small error in Gibbs free energies can translate into a relatively
large one (up to ±25%) in estimates’ relative yields.
Another feasible explanation is the possibility of the second step
of the reaction (isomerization) being at least partially kinetically
driven, which would be in agreement with experimental results presented
in Table 3, showing
different isomerization rates corresponding to different catalyst
loadings.

3 Conclusions
The
use of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and the careful selection of
reaction conditions enabled the synthesis of the number of products
with shifted double bonds in the metathesis/isomerization sequence.
Under these conditions in the processes involving substrates containing
heteroatoms in close proximity to the double bond (like in allylic
ethers, N,N-diallyltosylamides,
and N,N-diallylamides) almost exclusively
one isomer was reached. Due to that fact, the studied reaction can
be considered as an effective synthesis method of the vinylic ethers
and amides. When the heteroatom-free substrates were applied, the
subsequent isomerization was very limited because the isomerized product c has similar energy to the product b, resulting
from the RCM reaction. Computational estimates of the relative Gibbs
free energies of isomers are in good agreement with experimental data
and suggest that there exists a thermodynamic control of reaction
products, though a partial kinetic control at lower catalyst loadings
cannot be ruled out.

(2-MeTHF) bought from Sigma-Aldrich (ReagentPlus, 150–400 ppm
BHT as stabilizer, 155810-2.5L) was distilled from sodium/benzophenone.
Dry solvents were purified on an SPS column. Reactions were monitored
by thin layer chromatography with Sigma-Aldrich silica gel plates
(56524-25EA). Visualization was accomplished with either UV light
or by immersion in solutions of KMnO4 followed by heating
using a heat gun for about 15 s. Purification of starting materials
and products was carried out by flash chromatography using a Merck
silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh). 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained using an Agilent Mercury 400 MHz (400
MHz for 1H and 101 MHz for 13C) spectrometer.
Chemical shifts are reported relative to chloroform (δ = 7.26)
for 1H NMR and chloroform (δ = 77.16) for 13C NMR. Data are reported as br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet,
t = triplet, q = quartet, and m = multiplet. Coupling constants are
given in hertz. IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet
iS 50 FT-IR spectrometer; wavenumbers (ṽ) are given in cm–1. HRMS spectra were collected on a LCT Micromass TOF
HiRes apparatus at the Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw.
GC measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Clarus 580 instrument

to obtain intensive reflux of solvent. Then, an adequate amount of Gre-II precatalyst in DCM (100–500 μL, depends
on the amount of used catalyst) solution was added. Reaction was stirred
for 4 h under an argon atmosphere before being quenched with ethyl
vinyl ether (1 mL, 0.2 M solution in DCM) and then analyzed via GC.

argon pressure and transferred to the oil bath heated to 120 °C
(blast-shield was used for safety features). The resulting reaction
mixture was stirred at this temperature for 24 h. After cooling to
ambient temperature, the reaction was quenched with ethyl vinyl ether
(1 mL, 0.2 M solution in DCM). 100 μL of solution was taken

Computational
Data
In this work, we used the DFT and
DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods using all-atom models for all studied organic
compounds.49 In the geometry optimization
step, we used the M06 density functional with the 6-31G** for all
atoms.50 In all calculations, we have used
the standard energy convergence criterion of 5 × 10–5 Hartree. For each structure, frequencies were calculated to verify
the nature of each stationary point (zero imaginary frequencies for
minima). In the second step, we performed solvation energy calculations
using the Poisson–Boltzmann self-consistent polarizable continuum
method as implemented in Jaguar v.7.9 (Schrödinger, 2013) to
represent 2-MeTHF, using the dielectric constant of 6.97 and the effective
radius of 2.52 Å. For all stationary points, we have also performed
single-point energy calculations using the larger 6-311++G** basis
set as well as the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method and the def2-svp basis set.
Gibbs free energies discussed in this work were calculated as the
sum of electronic energy [either from single-point 6-311++G** or DLPNO-CCSD(T)
calculations], solvation energy, zero-point energy correction, thermal
correction to enthalpy, and the negative product of temperature and
entropy (at 120 °C). DFT calculations were performed in the Jaguar
v.7.9 software, whereas DLPNO-CCSD(T) was done in the Orca v.4.0.0.1
software.51,52
