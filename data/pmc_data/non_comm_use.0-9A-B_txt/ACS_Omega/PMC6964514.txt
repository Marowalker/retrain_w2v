Halogen–lithium exchange reaction of o-(silyl)bromobenzene 5 with tert-BuLi
afforded o-(silyl)lithiobenzene 6, which
was reacted with (alkoxy)diarylboranes 7 to form borate
intermediates 8. Treatment of 8 with chlorotrimethylsilane
formed o-(alkoxysilyl)(diarylboryl)benzenes 4. The C–O bond in 4 was activated by
intramolecular interaction between the oxygen atom and the boron atom. 4a readily reacted with MeOH and EtOH to afford the corresponding
alkoxysilanes 10 and 11, respectively. Treatment
of 10 with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) afforded
the silyloxyborate complex 13.

Introduction
Lewis acids have been recognized as useful
catalysts in synthetic
organic chemistry as well as main group chemistry. For example, Lewis
acids such as BF3, AlCl3, and SnCl4 activate the C–O bond in carbonyls, ethers, and epoxides
by coordinating to the oxygen atom and lead to its cleavage.1 In recent years, arylboranes have attracted much
attention as Lewis acids. Piers and Oestreich reported that B(C6F5)3 can activate the Si–H bond
in the hydrosilylation of aromatic aldehydes, ketones, and esters.2,3 In contrast to the well-studied Si–H bond activation, the
silicon–heteroatom bond activation has been less investigated.
Wrackmeyer reported that 2-boryl-1-(aminosilyl)alkene (I) readily reacted with nucleophiles to afford 2-boryl-1-(alkoxysilyl)alkene
(II) owing to the intramolecular Si–N bond activation
by the boryl group (Scheme 1).4

Scheme 1 Intramolecular Si–N
Bond Activation
Recently, we synthesized o-(hydrosilyl)(diarylboryl)benzene, 1, in which the dimesitylboryl and hydrosilyl groups were
linked through an o-phenylene skeleton.5 The Si–H bond was activated by the boryl
group for several types of reactions (Scheme 2): (i) dehydrogenative condensation with
alcohols to form 2 (R = Me (a); i-Pr (b)),5a (ii)
nucleophilic displacement by a fluoride ion to form 3,5b and (iii) H-Mes exchange between the
hydrogen atom on the Si atom and mesityl (Mes) group on the boron
atom.5c

Scheme 2 Si–H Bond Activation by an o-Boryl Group
in 1
Herein, we report the preparation of o-(alkoxysilyl)(boryl)benzenes
bearing less sterically demanding aryl groups (Ar = p-tolyl, p-t-butylphenyl) on the boron atom, and
the activation of C–O bond by diarylboryl groups.

Results and Discussion
o-[(Isopropoxy)dimethylsilyl](diarylboryl)benzenes 4 were prepared as shown in Scheme 3. The Br–Li exchange reaction of o-(dimethylsilyl)bromobenzene (5) with n-BuLi produced o-silyl(lithio)benzene 6,5a which reacted with diaryl(isopropoxy)borane 7 to form lithium [(isopropoxysilyl)phenyl]hydroborate 8 in 56% yield. The 11B nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectrum of 8 showed a doublet at δ = −9.7
because of the coupling of boron to one hydride (1JB–H = 66 Hz) in the typical region for
tetracoordinate borates. The 29Si NMR spectra of 8 was observed as a singlet at δ = 13.4. It is plausible
that the initially formed lithium [(hydrosilyl)phenyl](isopropoxy)borate 9 underwent intramolecular hydride–isopropoxide exchange
to form 8. Treatment of 8 with chlorotrimethylsilane
in situ afforded o-[(isopropoxy)silyl](diarylboryl)benzenes 4.6 Compound 4a was
isolated by distillation as a colorless oil in 70% yield, whereas 4b was isolated by recrystallization from toluene as colorless
crystals in 58% yield. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
at B3PW91/6-31G(d) level of theory showed that anion part of 8 was more stable than that of 9 by 9.2–12.3
kcal/mol.7

Scheme 3 Preparations of 4
via Hydride–Isopropoxide Exchange in 9
The reaction of 4a with MeOH and
EtOH in a J. Young
NMR tube resulted in the formation of methoxysilane 10 and ethoxysilane 11 in 96 and 92% yield, respectively,
as shown in Scheme 4. In contrast, 4a did not react with tert-BuOH at all. When the same reaction was performed in a reaction
flask, 10 and 11 were isolated as colorless
crystals in 77 and 59% yield, respectively.

Scheme 4 Reactions of 4a with Alcohols (NMR
Yields Are Given in Parentheses)
The 11B NMR signal of 4a (δ = 31)
was shifted upfield, whereas the 29Si NMR signal of 4a (δ = 20.0) was shifted downfield as compared to the
corresponding values of 2b (δ(11B) =
73; δ(29Si) = 4.6). With decreasing steric bulkiness
of the alkoxy groups (4a > 11 > 10), the 11B NMR signal was shifted upfield and
the 29Si NMR signal was shifted downfield, as shown in Table 1. These chemical shifts
were also compared to those of the corresponding dimethylphenyl(alkoxy)silanes 12 (R = Me, Et, i-Pr), showing that the electronic
effect of the alkoxy groups is not significant. The intramolecular
coordination of the oxygen atom to the boron atom increased the electron
density on the boron atom and decreased that on the silicon atom.

Molecular structure of 10 was finally
determined by
X-ray crystallographic analysis (Figure 1).8 The B···O
interatomic distance (1.652(2) Å) was much shorter than the sum
of the van der Waals radii of the two elements (B: 1.85 Å; O:
1.52 Å)9 and only 7–8% longer
than the sum of their covalent bond radii (B: 0.84 Å; O: 0.66
Å).9 The boron atom adopted an intermediate
geometry between tetrahedral and trigonal planar with the sum of the
bond angles around the boron atom (∑(C–B–C) =
343°). The five-membered ring consisting of C1, Si1, O1, B1,
and C2 atoms was almost planar and coplanar with the phenylene ring.
The oxygen atom adopted a trigonal planar geometry (∑(O) =
359°) and the tetrahedral geometry of the boron atom was distorted
because of the small endocyclic bond angle (O1–B1–C2
= 99.78(9)°). The Si–O (1.714(1) Å) and C–O
(1.448(1) Å) bonds were longer than the typical Si–O (1.51
Å) and C–O (1.43 Å) bonds,9 respectively, but slightly shorter than those of silylated oxonium
ions.10 These structural parameters support
the intramolecular coordination of the oxygen atom to the boron atom
as mentioned above.

99.78(9).

To gain further insight into the electronic structure
of the (alkoxysilyl)(boryl)benzenes,
DFT calculations of 10 and 2 (R = Me) were
performed at B3PW91/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory (Figure 2 and Supporting Information).7 The lone pair of
electrons on the oxygen atom in 10 contributed to highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) – 1 (−6.27 eV). The
HOMO (−6.46 eV) of 10 is the π orbital of
the tolyl groups, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO,
−0.59 eV) is mainly the π* orbital of the phenylene skeleton.
The vacant 2p orbital on the boron atom in 10 was involved
in LUMO + 2 (−0.40 eV). The charge distribution was revealed
by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis (Mulliken charge in parentheses),
as shown in Figure 3.11 Compared to 2 (R = Me), 10 exhibited more positive charges on the oxygen atom (−0.84
vs −0.92) and the methyl carbon atoms (+0.39 vs +0.31) bonded
to it, while the boron atom had lesser positive charges (+0.74 vs
+1.97).

level of theory with overlay of HOMO – 1 (left) and LUMO +
2 (right) (isosurface value = 0.04).

in 10 (left) and 2 (R = Me) (right).

The perturbation theory energy analysis in NBO
basis reveals delocalization
from the donor LPO to the acceptor LP*B with
the occupancy of 0.306:12 the stabilization
energy E(2) was calculated to be 16.2 kcal/mol (see Supporting Information).

The B···O
interaction was expected to render the
carbon atom more electropositive. Thus, treatment of 10 with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) afforded silyloxyborate–(DABCO-Me)+ complex 13, as shown in Scheme 5. Compound 13 was isolated as
colorless crystals by recrystallization from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
in 79% yield. The structure of 13 was characterized by
its 11B NMR (δ = 3.0) and 29Si NMR (δ
= 9.1) signals, which were consistent with those of oxasilaboratacyclopentene
(δ(11B) = 6.0; δ(29Si) = 10.5)5d and benzosiloxaborole (δ(11B) = 31.0; δ(29Si) = 22.3).13 The reaction of 10 with NEt3 in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) did not occur even after heating at 80 °C for a day. It
is worth noting that compound 10 was regenerated upon
treatment of 13 with MeI.4a The reaction of 10 with KF in the presence of 18-crown-6
led to the Me–O bond cleavage to form 14 in 70%
yield as a white precipitate from THF–hexane (Scheme 6). The reason why the fluoride
ion attacks the methyl carbon rather than the boron atom may be that
formation of the stable 5-membered ring is more favorable than formation
of an acyclic fluoroborate.

Conclusions
o-[(Isopropoxy)silyl](diarylboryl)benzenes 4 bearing less sterically demanding aryl groups were prepared.
The interaction between the oxygen atom and boron atom was confirmed
by NMR spectra, X-ray crystal structure analysis, and DFT calculations.
The B···O interaction led the C–O bond activation.

MeI (56 μL, 0.90 mmol) was added dropwise via a syringe at room
temperature and the reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature
for 10 min. After the solvents were removed in vacuo, the residue
was dissolved in toluene (1 mL) and filtered. The filtrate was cooled
to −18 °C to obtain colorless crystals of 10 (72 mg, 67% yield).

X-ray Crystallographic Analysis
X-ray crystallographic
data for 10 was collected using a SMART APEX-II CCD diffractometer
with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å) at 173 K at the Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of
Science, Hiroshima University. The structure was solved by direct
methods using SIR 97 and refined by a full-matrix least-squares procedure
based on F2 with SHELX-97.8 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen
atoms were located at the expected positions by geometrical calculations
and refined isotropically or found on the difference Fourier map and
refined isotropically.
