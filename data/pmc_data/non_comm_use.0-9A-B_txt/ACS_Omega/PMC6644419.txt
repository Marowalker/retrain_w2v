Hybrid perovskite materials used
for realization of efficient perovskite
solar cells have drawn great attention in both academic and industrial
sectors. It was reported that the crystallinity of hybrid thin-film
perovskite materials plays an important role in device performance.
In this study, we report a novel and simple method to tune the crystallinity
of CH3NH3PbI3 thin film for device
performance of perovskite solar cells. By employing tetraphenylphosphonium
chloride on the top of PbI2 thin layer in the two-step
perovskite deposition processes, the crystallinity of the resultant
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film was tuned. As
a result, perovskite solar cells by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with tuned crystallinity exhibit an enlarged
open-circuit voltage and enhanced short-circuit current, thus boosted
efficiency as well as reduced photocurrent hysteresis compared to
pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. These
results indicate that our study provides a new simple way to boost
device performance of perovskite solar cells through tuning the crystallinity
of CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.

1 Introduction
In the past years, hybrid
perovskite materials used for realization
of efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn great attention
in both academic and industrial sectors due to their advanced features,
such as large absorption coefficient,1,2 high charge-carrier
mobility,3,4 and long charge-carrier diffusion lengths.5,6 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more than 22% have been
reported from PSCs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3 with large crystal and generic interfacial engineering in
PSCs device structure.7−10 However, there is still a gap to realize 31% PCE, a theoretical
value, from CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs.11 Toward the end, device performance parameters,
short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit
voltage (VOC), and fill factors (FFs)
are required to be enhanced for boosting PCE. In the case of PSCs
fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, VOC is estimated to be 1.3 V.11 But the reported VOC always
exhibited unavoidable optical and electrical losses,12,13 which were induced by interfacial states.14−16 Toward the
end, passivating the charge defects and improving the energy disorder
at the electron extraction layer have been utilized to realize large VOC.16−22 On the other hand, many effects have been also devoted to enhance JSC PSCs.11,23−25 Han et al. reported a solvent-annealing process to control the crystal
orientation transformation to improve charge-carrier collection and
prolong charge-carrier lifetime, thus boosting JSC.26 Recently, Leblebici et al.
have found that different crystal facets of individual grains have
a direct impact on both VOC and JSC.27 Thus, optimization
of microscopic facet orientation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals in polycrystalline perovskite thin film could boost
both VOC and JSC.26−29

In this study, we report a novel and simple method to tune
the
crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 thin
film for boosting PSCs device performance. By employing tetraphenylphosphonium
chloride (TPPCl) on the top of PbI2 thin layer in the two-step
perovskite deposition processes, the crystallinity of the resultant
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film was tuned. As
a result, the PSCs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layer exhibit
a VOC of 1.12 V, a JSC of 21.71 mA/cm2, an FF of 74.43, and a corresponding
PCE of 18.04%, with dramatically reduced hysteresis, compared to the
PSCs fabricated by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, which exhibit a VOC of 1.04
V, a JSC of 21.08 mA/cm2, an
FF of 74.41, and a corresponding PCE of 16.34%, with serious hysteresis.

2 Results and Discussion
TPPCl is selected to tune the
crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 thin
film through modification of PbI2 thin-layer surface originated
from the Cl– anion, which probably chelated with
the Pb2+ cations
and altered the kinetics of thin-film formation.29 The molecular structure of TPPCl is shown in Scheme 1a. Figure 1a–e presents the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of pristine PbI2 thin film and
PbI2 thin films treated with the TPPCl ultrathin layers.
It is found that pristine PbI2 thin film possesses layered
crystals with sizes of tens of nanometers and many voids. Such observation
is in good agreement with the morphologies of PbI2 thin
film reported by others.30,31 After the PbI2 thin films are treated with different TPPCl ultrathin layers cast
from different concentrations of TPPCl solutions, PbI2 thin
films still possess layered crystals with sizes of tens of nanometers
and many voids, but a mass of interlaced particles like strip is adhered
to the surfaces of PbI2 thin films. As the TPPCl solution
is at 1 mg/mL, several well-distributed large TPPCl particles are
formed on the surface of PbI2 thin film. As the TPPCl solution
is further increased to 1.5 mg/mL, large TPPCl nanoparticles are aggregated
on the surface of PbI2 thin film.

Figure 1f–j
presents the SEM images of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers. Compared to pristine
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, no significant
change in the film morphology is observed in the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin
layer cast from TPPCl solution with a concentration of 0.25 mg/mL.
However, the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film
pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from TPPCl solution
with a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, displays larger and more inerratic
grains. The CH3NH3PbI3 thin film
pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from TPPCl solution
with a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL, shows larger gains and higher gains
continuity with distinctly less grain boundaries. The CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl
ultrathin layer cast from TPPCl solution with a concentration of 1.5
mg/mL, possesses very fine grain with flatness feature of grain boundary.
Thus, these results demonstrate that the TPPCl ultrathin layers affect
the qualities of resultant CH3NH3PbI3 thin films.

Figure 2 presents
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers.
No XRD patterns assigned to TPPCl ultrathin layer are found in all
CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, indicating
that TPPCl is evaporated during the thermal annealing for the formation
of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. All CH3NH3PbI3 thin films exhibit the same
diffraction peaks located at 14.1, 28.5, and 31.9°, corresponding
to the (110), (220), and (114) crystal planes. No XRD patterns assigned
to TPPCl ultrathin layer are found in all. These results indicate
that all CH3NH3PbI3 thin films possess
the tetragonal crystal phase.29,32 However, the peak intensities
are different. The highest peak intensity (the (110) plane) is observed
from the CH3NH3PbI3 film pretreated
with the TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from a 1.0 mg/mL concentration
of TPPCl solution, indicating that the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layer
possesses the best crystallinity, which is in good agreement with
the SEM results. All of these results imply that the CH3NH3PbI3 film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin
layer cast from a 1.0 mg/mL concentration of TPPCl solution, possesses
optimal photovoltaic properties.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 film and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films
pretreated with the TPPCl ultralayers cast from TPPCl solutions with
concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL.

Figure 3 depicts
the UV–vis absorption spectra of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and CH3NH3PbI3 film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layers.
All CH3NH3PbI3 thin films have identical
absorption spectrum with the same onset of absorption, indicating
that the TPPCl ultrathin layers do not have any influence on the band
gap of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.
However, the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film
pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layers possesses gradually enhanced
absorbance ranging from 380 to 770 nm along with the TPPCl ultrathin
layers cast from increased concentrations of TPPCl solutions. The
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with
the TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from a 1.0 mg/mL concentration of TPPCl
solution possesses the highest absorbance. Such high absorbance indicates
that more light will be absorbed by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, implying that more photocurrent could
be generated.

pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layers cast from TPPCl solutions
with concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL.

The photovoltaic properties of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin
layers are evaluated
through investigation of device performance of PSCs with a device
structure of ITO/PTAA/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, as shown in Scheme 1b, where ITO is indium tin oxide, which acts as the
anode; PTAA is poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine], which
acts as the hole extraction layer; PC61BM is 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, which acts as the electron extraction
layer; BCP is bathocuproine, which acts as the hole blocking layer;
and Ag is sliver, which acts as the cathode. The current density versus
voltage (J–V) characteristics
of PSCs are shown in Figure 4a. The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PSCs fabricated
by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film
exhibit a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 21.08 mA/cm2, an FF of 74.41, and a corresponding
PCE of 16.34%. These device performance parameters are consistent
with reported values from PSCs with the same device structure.7−9 The PSCs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers exhibit enlarged VOC, enhanced JSC, and thus boosted PCEs. The best device performance (VOC of 1.12 V, JSC of 21.71
mA/cm2, FF of 74.43, and the corresponding PCE of 18.04%),
is observed from the PSCs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layer
cast from a 1.0 mg/mL concentration of TPPCl solution.

Figure 4b presents
the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of PSCs fabricated by either
pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or
CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated
with TPPCl ultrathin layers. Enhanced EQE values are observed from
the PSCs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers compared to those
by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.
The integrated JSC values are 20.16 mA/cm2 for the PSCs fabricated by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, and 20.42, 20.83, 20.80, and 20.46
mA/cm2 for the PSCs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin
layers cast from the TPPCl solutions with concentrations of 0.25,
0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively. These JSC values are consistent with the JSC extracted from J–V characteristics,
as shown in Figure 4a.

The increased JSC is attributed
to
the enlarged grain size (Figure 2) and stronger light-harvesting ability of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin
layers (Figure 3).33,34 To further understand enhanced JSC,
transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements
are conducted to assess the intrinsic properties of charge-carrier
extraction and charge-carriers recombination in PSCs.35,36Figure 5a presents
the normalized TPC of the PSCs fabricated by either pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin
layers. The PSCs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers possess
slightly shorter charge extraction lifetimes (0.17, 0.24, and 0.23
μs) compared to that (0.29 μs) by the PSCs fabricated
the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film,
indicating that reduced trap-assisted charge recombination and better
charge extraction efficiencies have taken place in these PSCs. However,
the longest charge extraction lifetime (0.43 μs) is observed
in the PSCs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layers cast from a
1.5 mg/mL concentration of the TPPCl solution, indicating that PSCs
fabricated by such thin film exhibit the poorest device performance.

Figure 5 (a) Transient
photocurrent and (b) transient photovoltage decays
of PSCs fabricated by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layers cast from
TPPCl solutions with concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL.

Figure 5b shows
the normalized TPV of the PSCs fabricated by either pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin
layers. The PSCs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers possess
longer charge recombination lifetimes to reach the same TPV compared
to those fabricated by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. The longest charge recombination lifetime is observed
in the PSCs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from a
1 mg/mL concentration of the TPPCl solution. The longer charge recombination
lifetime demonstrates the more suppressed charge recombination in
PSCs. Thus, the PSCs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers possess
larger JSC values compared to those fabricated
by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.

The light intensity dependence on VOC is further investigated to illustrate the charge-carrier recombination
in PSCs. Figure 6a
displays the light intensity dependence on VOC for the PSCs fabricated by either pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers.
According to VOC ∝ S In(I)37 (where S is the slope and I is the light intensity),
the smallest S (0.038) is observed in the PSCs fabricated
by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated
with the TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from a 1 mg/mL concentration of
the TPPCl solution, indicating that suppressed trap-assisted charge
recombination occurred in PSCs.38 Therefore,
the PSCs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from a
1 mg/mL concentration of the TPPCl solution exhibit the highest JSC value among all PSCs.

Figure 6 (a) VOC dependence on different light
intensities and (b) J–V characteristics,
in the dark, of the PSCs fabricated by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layers
cast from TPPCl solutions with concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1,
and 1.5 mg/mL.

To understand the underlying
physics of enlarged VOC, the J–V characteristics
of PSCs are measured in the dark, and the results are shown in Figure 6b. According to the
Shockley–Queisser model,39 the relationship
between J and VOC is
described as  where J0 is the
reverse dark current density, q is the electron charge, n is the diode ideality factor, k is the
Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Thus,
it concludes that a large VOC is anticipated
from the PSCs with a low value of J0.
As shown in Figure 6b, the PSCs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers possess
low J0 values compared to those fabricated
by the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.
In particular, the PSCs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layer
cast from a 1 mg/mL concentration of the TPPCl solution possess the
lowest J0. Thus, the PSCs fabricated by
the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated
with the TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from a 1 mg/mL concentration of
the TPPCl solution exhibit the largest VOC value.

The hysteresis behaviors of PSCs are further investigated. Figure 7a–e presents
the J–V characteristics of
the PSCs fabricated by either pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film or the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layers under either
forward scan direction (from the negative voltage to the positive
voltage) or reserved scan direction (from the positive voltage to
the negative voltage). The hysteresis index (HI) is defined as .40Table 1 summarizes PCEs and
the corresponding HI values of PSCs under different scan directions.
Clearly, the PSCs fabricated by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film exhibit PCEs of 17.00 and 17.66% under
forward and reversed scan directions, respectively, which reveal an
HI value of 3.74%. A stable PCE and the smallest HI are observed from
the PSCs fabricated by the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with TPPCl ultrathin layer cast from a 1 mg/mL
concentration of the TPPCl solution. Thus, the PSCs fabricated by
the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated
with the TPPCl ultrathin layers possess reduced photocurrent hysteresis.
Such reduced photocurrent hysteresis behavior probably originated
from suppressed charge recombination due to the improved crystallinity
of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films.

Figure 7 J–V characteristics of
the PSCs fabricated by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film and the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films pretreated with the TPPCl ultrathin layers cast from
TPPCl solutions with concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL
and measured under forward and reverse scan directions.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we reported a simple method to tune the crystallinity
of CH3NH3PbI3 thin film in a two-step
process. Compared to pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, large and inerratic grains have been observed
in the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated
with the TPPCl ultrathin layer. As a result, the PSCs fabricated by
CH3NH3PbI3 thin film pretreated with
TPPCl ultrathin layer exhibit a VOC of
1.12 V, a JSC of 21.71 mA/cm2, an FF of 74.43, and a corresponding PCE of 18.04%, with dramatically
reduced hysteresis compared to the PSCs fabricated by pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, which exhibit a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 21.08 mA/cm2, an FF of 74.41, and a corresponding
PCE of 16.34%, with serious hysteresis. Our results provide a new
strategy to boost device performance through tuning the crystallinity
of perovskite thin films.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Bathocuproine (BCP), tetraphenylphosphonium
chloride (TPPCl), n-butyl alcohol, anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and ethanol
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid
methyl ester (PC61BM) was purchased from 1-Material Inc.
Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and methylammonium
iodide (MAI) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology
Corp. All materials were used as received without further purification.

4.2 Solution Preparation
PbI2 was
first dissolved in DMF at a concentration of 400 mg/mL and then
stirred at 60 °C for 12 h to form a PbI2 solution.
Afterward, the PbI2 solution was filtered using a filter
of size 0.45 mm to obtain a transparent yellow solution. The MAI was
dissolved in ethanol to form an MAI solution with a concentration
of 35 mg/mL. TPPCl was dissolved in n-butyl alcohol
with concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL.

4.3 Preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 Thin
Film
The CH3NH3PbI3 thin
films were prepared by a two-step deposition
method. PbI2 solution was first spin-cast on the top of
the PTAA layer, which was cast from the corresponding solution, and
thermally annealed at 80 °C for 5 min. After PbI2 thin
film was cooled to room temperature, the TPPCl ultrathin layer was
coated on the top of PbI2 thin film from TPPCl solution
at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Afterward, the MAI thin layer was spin-coated
on the top of either pristine PbI2 thin film or the PbI2/TPPCl thin film and thermally annealed at 100 °C for
2 h for converting PbI2 and CH3NH3I into CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.

4.4 Characterization of CH3NH3PbI3 Thin Film
The surface profilometer (Tencor,
Alpha-500) was used to measure the film thickness. UV–vis absorption
spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films
were recorded on an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Top-view images of
CH3NH3PbI3 thin films were obtained
using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Merlin).

4.5 Fabrication of Perovskite Solar Cells
Precleaned
indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were first treated
by oxygen plasma for 3 min. Afterward, ∼10 nm of the PTAA film
was spin-cast on the top of the ITO substrates from PTAA solution
and then thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 thin films were prepared by
the two-step deposition method described above. Then, an ∼40
nm thick PC61BM layer was spin-cast on the top of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. Afterward, an ∼10
nm BCP thin film was spin-cast on the top of the PC61BM
layer. Finally, an ∼100 nm silver (Ag) electrode was thermally
evaporated on the top of the BCP layer in vacuum with a base pressure
of 2 × 10–6 mbar. The device area was measured
to be 5.7 mm2.

4.6 Characterization of Perovskite
Solar Cells
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs were measured
under 1 sun from
an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI, XES-40S1), where light
intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell with
a KG5 visible filter. The photocurrent hysteresis properties of PSCs
were assessed by testing the PSCs at both forward (from −1.2
to 0.2 V) and reverse (from 0.2 to −1.2 V) directions at a
scan rate of 3 V/s. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra
of PSCs were recorded on a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with an SR830 lock-in
amplifier, a bromine tungsten light source, and a calibrated Si detector.

4.6.1 Transient Photovoltage and Transient Photocurrent
Measurements
A digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3052C)
with input impedances of 1 MΩ and 50 Ω was used to monitor
the charge density decay and charge extraction time of PSCs. The transient
photovoltage of PSCs was measured under 0.03 sun illumination with
a small perturbation by an attenuated laser pulse (500 nm). The laser-pulse-induced
photovoltage variation (ΔV) was smaller than
5% of the VOC produced by the background
illumination. The transient photocurrent of PSCs was measured by applying
laser pulses to the short-circuited devices in the dark with an excitation
wavelength of 500 nm, a pulse width of 120 fs, and a repetition rate
of 1 kHz.
