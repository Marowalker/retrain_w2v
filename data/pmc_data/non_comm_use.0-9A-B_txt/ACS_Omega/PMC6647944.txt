New
class of ternary nanohetrostructures have been proposed by mixing
2D gallium nitride (GaN) with graphene and 2D hexagonal boron nitride
(BN) with an aim towards desgining innovative 2D materials for applications
in electronics and other industries. The structural stability
and electronic properties of these nanoheterostructures have been
analyzed using first-principles based calculations done in the framework
of density functional theory. Different structure patterns have been
analyzed to identify the most stable structures. It is found to be
more energetically favorable that the carbon atoms occupy the positions
of the nitrogen atoms in a clustered pattern in CC–GaN heterostructures,
whereas boron doping is preferred in the reverse order, where isolated
BN and GaN layered configurations are preferred in BN–GaN heterostructures.
These 2D nanoheterostructures are energetically favored materials
with direct band gap and have potential application in nanoscale semiconducting
and nanoscale optoelectronic devices.

Introduction
Simulations based on
quantum mechanical treatment of atoms and
electrons have a great impact on computational material science research.
These simulations and modeling techniques not only provide atomistic-level
understanding but also give necessary information to tailor design
new materials for future technologies. Density functional theory (DFT)-based
techniques have found applications in academia as well as different
areas of industrial research.

A great interest has been shown
by semiconductor industry on gallium
nitride (GaN)-based device structures.1,2 Owing to its
large direct band gap3 and high peak velocity,4 GaN possesses substantial promise for optical
devices and high-power electronics. Moreover, because of its larger
peak electron velocity, larger saturation velocity, and higher thermal
stability, GaN is an ideal material in high-power, high-temperature,
and high-frequency electronic applications. Recent research shows
that incorporating carbon atoms into the GaN volume strongly alters
their electronic and magnetic properties.5,6 This
incorporation of carbon in GaN films results in an insulating material
with resistance >108 Ω.7,8 The
GaN films
in their high resistive forms are finding applications as insulating
buffer layers or substrates in GaN-based device technologies.

Graphene is still one of the most exciting topics of research in
condensed matter physics as well as in materials science, due to its
remarkable electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties,9−15 in particular as its charge carriers behave like massless Dirac
particles. Additionally, through its electronic band gap tuning, graphene
has found applications in nanoelectronic devices.9,16 Energy
band gap can be opened in graphene through various means, including
hydrogenation,17 interaction with substrate,18,19 molecules adsorption,20 and also deposition
on a latticed-matched substrate, such as SiO2 or hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN).21,22 Recently, various attempts have
been made to fabricate graphene devices by engineering their band
gaps through doping.23−25 Investigations on doped graphene nanoribbons23,24 indicate that upon doping by N or B, n-type or p-type semiconducting
graphene can possibly be obtained, respectively. It has been experimentally
established that upon N doping of graphene,23 the Dirac point in the band structure of graphene tends to move
below the Fermi level (EF) and an
energy gap appears at high-symmetric K-point. Boron
nitride is an insulator with strong ionic bond and can be synthesized
in hexagonal close-packed structure,26 similar
to graphite, with lattice constants very close to those of graphite.
This auxiliary closeness among graphite and hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN) drove a few examinations to make multilayers of these materials,
which can have semiconducting properties with a small band gap.

A simple metal–insulator–n-type-GaN diode produces
blue electroluminescence,27 and consequently,
GaN has been studied as a suitable material in optoelectronic devices
as laser and light-emitting diodes. However, the concentration of
free electrons is too large (1018–1020 cm–3) for the fabrication of a p-type crystal
to be successful. Nitrogen vacancies have been found as major source
of free electrons rather than any unknown donor impurities.28 In this work, we performed first-principles
electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory
approximation to investigate the effects of the incorporation of CC
and BN layers in the GaN two-dimensional (2D) sheet on its structural
and electronic properties. We have investigated two different patterns
of heterostructures: first, in the GaN 2D structure, we replaced two
adjacent gallium nitride layers by two layers of carbon atoms in alternative
patterns, and in the second configuration, single gallium nitride
layers are replaced by single carbon–carbon layer in alternate
patterns. Similar configurations are investigated by replacing GaN
layers by BN layers, keeping boron concentration of 25% in both cases.
The paper is organized as follows: Under Results
and Discussion section (Structure and Stabilty sub-section), we first define the hetrostructures and their
different configurations and discuss their stability on the basis
of fomation energies and structural changes. Next, we describe the
electronic properties, including band structure and density-of-states
(DOS) plots, and explain the band gap changes due to incorporation
of CC and BN layers in 2D GaN sheet. We conclude the work in
the Conclusions section, whereas computational
and other technical details of the calculations are given at
the end in Computational Methodology section.

Results
and Discussion
Structure and Stability
In this section,
we discuss
the structures and different configurations of heteronanostructures
investigated in the present work. First, we investigated CC:GaN hetrostructures
by replacing gallium nitride (GaN) layers with carbon carbon (CC)
layers in a 2D GaN sheet of 32 atoms. We tried two different configurations:
(a) in the first configuration (CC-GaN1), we replaced
single gallium nitride layers by single layers of carbon atoms  in
alternative patterns (Figure 1a,b); in the second configuration (CC-GaN2), we replaced two adjacent GaN layers by two CC layers (Figure 1b), with a carbon
concentration of 50% in each case. Similarly, we modeled the BN:GaN
nanoheterostructures and considered two different configurations of
alternate BN–GaN layers (BN-GaN1)(Figure 2a) and two alternate BN–BN
and GaN–GaN layers (BN-GaN2)(Figure 2b), with a BN layer concentration
of 50% in each case.

Figure 1 Simulated structures of CC:GaN: (a) CC:GaN heterostructure
in configuration
1 (CC:GaN1), (b) CC:GaN heterostructure in configuration
2 (CC:GaN2). A 2 × 2 unit cell is shown for the better
representation of chemical bonding and structures, where a 32-atom
GaN supercell is doped with C atoms with carbon concentrations of
50% used in the calculations.

Figure 2 Simulated structures of BN:GaN: (a) BN:GaN heterostructure in configuration
1 (BN:GaN1), (b) BN:GaN heterostructure in configuration
2 (BN:GaN2). A 2 × 2 unit cell is shown for the better
representation of chemical bonding and structures, where a 32-atom
GaN supercell is doped with B atoms with boron concentrations of 25%
used in the calculations.

We evaluated the stability of the CC:GaN nanoheterostructures
by
calculating the formation energy of each substitution to find the
energetically most favorable configurations, as 1  where ECC:GaN is
the total ground-state energy of the CC–GaN nanoheterostructure; EC, EGa, and EN are the ground-state energies of carbon, gallium,
and nitrogen atoms, respectively; and NC, NGa, and NN are the number of carbon, gallium, and nitrogen atoms in the heterostructure,
respectively.

Similarly, we calculated the formation energy
of BN:GaN nanoheterostructures
as  with EBN:GaN as
the ground-state energy of the BN:GaN nanoheterostructure; EB, EGa, and EN as the ground-state energies of isolated boron,
gallium, and nitrogen atoms, respectively; and NB, NGa, and NN are the number of boron, gallium, and nitrogen atoms in the
heterostructure, respectively.

The calculated formation energies
per atom for different hetrostructures is
tabulated in Table 1, and it can be seen that for all concentrations, the formation energy
is lower when a carbon atom or a boron atom occupies the position
of a gallium atom; therefore, it is energetically more favorable that
carbon or boron atoms occupy the positions of gallium atoms in the
GaN 2D structure. Additionally, all of the new 2D nanoheterostructures
have negative formation energies, which shows that these Gr:GaN and
BN:GaN structures are thermodynamically stable. Further, we calculated
the formation energy per atom for GaN sheet and found the value to
be −5.720 eV, which is greater than the formation energies
per atom (Table 1)
for all of the new CC:GaN and BN:GaN structures designed, indicating
new heterostructures to be more stable.

CC:GaN2	0.50	–6.9634	
BN:GaN1	0.25	–6.9671	
BN:GaN2	0.25	–6.9527	
Our calculations indicate
that in CC:GaN heterostructures, clustering
of CC chains and GaN chains is favored over scattering of CC and GaN
chains within the ternary structure, with clustered configurations
(CC:GaN2) being more stable compared to isolated chains
configuration (CC:GaN1). In contrast to CC:GaN, clustering
of chains is not favored in BN:GaN configurations and GaN and BN single
isolated layered structure is more stable (BN:GaN1), as
depicted in Table 1, reporting the formation energies. From Table 2, we observe that as a result of incorporating
CC and BN layers in GaN structures, the supercell shrinks and the
volume of the simulated 32-atom GaN supercell decreases from 981.09
to 825.70 Å3 and to 776.86 Å3 for
most stable CC:GaN and BN:GaN structures, respectively.

In two CC:GaN configurations
investigated, we observe that C–C
bonds and Ga–N bonds are of slightly smaller length in the
second configuration (1.505 Ǻ in CC:GaN2) compared
to that in the first configuration (1.515 Ǻ in CC:GaN1), indicating more stronger bonding in the second configuration
and preferring bigger clusters of Ga–N and C–C chains
over isolated CC and GaN chains in graphene and gallium nitride heterostructures
(Table 3). However,
in BN:GaN, shorter bond lengths and hence stronger bonds are found
to be indicative of more stability of segregated layered structures
of BN–GaN. Moreover, Ga–N bonds are found to be more
stiffer in CC:GaN and BN:GaN structures than in pristine GaN 2D structure,
resulting in their stability and rigidity due to a strong covalent
bonding character.

Electronic Properties
The electronic band structures
at high-symmetry k-points for both CC:GaN and BN:GaN
heterostructures are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The band gap
of GaN 2D sheet is found to be 2.285 eV (Figure S4). The calculated band gaps of CC:GaN heterostructures
(Figure 3a,b) are 1.92
and 1.70 eV for CC:GaN1 and CC:GaN2, respectively,
while for two BN:GaN heterostructures (25% B concentration, Figure 4a,b), the band gaps
are found to be 2.44 and 2.14 eV, respectively, for BN:GaN1 and BN:GaN2 heterostructures. Hence, incorporation of
graphene CC layers in GaN 2D structure lowers the electronic band
gap, whereas incorporation of BN layers increases the band gap of
GaN 2D structure. The gaps occur due to mixed hybridization of valence
states of Ga and N with that of C atoms and due to mixed hybridization
of valence states of Ga and N with that of B atoms in their respective
compounds. The calculated values of band gap are presented in Table 2.

Figure 4 Calculated band structures at high-symmetry k-points
for B-doped GaN: (a) BN:GaN1 configuration and (b) BN:GaN2 configuration.

To further analyze the nature of interactions and origin
of gaps
in these nanoheterostructures, we have plotted the DOS and projected
DOS (p-DOS) of CC:GaN heterostructures in Figures 5 and 6 and for BN:GaN
heterostructures in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. On visualization
of atomic orbitals, we note that the DOS near the gaps is essentially
of pz character occurring from the antibonding
and bonding Ga and N states hybridizing with those of pz states of carbon. Similar hybridization of states
is observed due to boron atoms in BN–GaN heterostructures.
The position of the energy gap due to such hybridization is very crucial
such that upon doping of GaN by different coverage or configurations
of C or B, the energy gap occurs at the EF. For the ternary structures, the calculated band gaps are given
in Table 2. From the
electronic band structure plots analysis, we observe that these structures
are direct band gap materials with band gap values of 1.92, 1.70,
2.44, and 2.14 eV, with the valance band and conduction band to be
located at the γ k-point. A comparison with
the band structures of graphene and GaN with the new 2D structures
shows that new bands are formed due to hybridization of states in
the new 2D ternary compounds.

Conclusions
In this article, we describe a successful
example of the application
of DFT to design new structural materials. We used DFT calculations
to investigate the ground-state structural and electronic properties
of new 2D heterostructures of 2D gallium nitride, graphene, and h-boron
nitride. We discussed the stability through calculation of formation
energies of different heterostructures, investigating two different
doping patterns for both the CC:GaN and BN:GaN heterostructures. Similar
to borocarbonitrides, these new 2D materials have tunable band gap
and may find applications in various fields. These results may provide
guidance in practical engineering applications, especially to tune
the band gap in 2D materials. Finally, our results are useful to provide
an explanation of the formation of hybridized 2D nanomaterials. This
new form of hybridized 2D material facilitates the development of
band gap engineering and applications, in particular, in nanoelectronics
and nano-optics. To generalize, we would like to emphasize that DFT
calculations should not only be considered useful for studying some
selected cases, i.e., compounds with a given composition as in the
present case, but they are very useful to produce a database for searching
a large space of possible structural configurations. Our case study
could provide some guidelines for the industrialists and academic
scientists in the development of new materials.

Computational Methods
The first-principles calculations performed in the present work
use generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of density functional
theory (DFT) through Quantum ESPRESSO package.29 The calculations are based on ultrasoft pseudopotentials30 for modeling the ion–electron interactions31 employing the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) exchange–correlation functional. We have used the
Methfessel–Paxton smearing technique with a Gaussian broadening
of 0.003 Ry.32 A full variable-cell relaxation
of the structure has been performed with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno33−35 scheme to get minimum total energy using the Hellmann–Feynman
forces36,37 calculations on atoms, with a tolerance
on forces on each atom of 0.001 Ry/Bohr. To model monolayer of 2D
sheets, interactions between the periodic images of the sheets have
been made negligible through introducing a vacuum of 10 Ǻ
in the z-direction. A 30 Ry cutoff has been used
for representing wave functions in plane wave basis, while a 180 Ry
cutoff for the density has been implemented in the calculations. We
have included dispersion interaction corrections using semiempirical
Grimme’s DFT-D2 approach.38

After getting the relaxed structures, we performed self-consistent
calculations, and Brillouin zone integrations were sampled with a
G-centered 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack39k-point grid, followed by the non-self-consistent
calculations for band structures DOS and p-DOS separately. We used
9 × 9 × 1 k-points mesh along the path
Γ–M–K−Γ in the irreducible Brillouin
zone to obtain the band structure with very fine mesh points.
