Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
with perovskite and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PCBM) heterojunction have attracted much interest
because they can be fabricated by a low-temperature process and exhibit
high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Various compositional engineering
and interface engineering approaches have been applied to produce
high-performance PSC devices. In this study, we found that high-quality
lead halide crystal precursor has a significant effect on the perovskite
film quality and it could enhance perovskite film light absorption,
reduce crystal defects, and suppress charge recombination, resulting
in enhanced device performance (from 8.9 to 15.0% for CH3NH3PbI3 and from 14.2 to 18.0% for MA0.7FA0.3PbI3–xClx). Moreover, electron and hole interlayer free
devices were achieved by using high-quality PbI2 crystals
and the devices exhibited a high PCE of 13.6 and 10.4% for glass and
flexible substrates, respectively. This is important for simplifying
the perovskite solar cell fabrication process without complex interface
engineering involved, especially for printed PSCs.

1 Introduction
Perovskite
solar cells (PSCs) have received much attention in recent
years due to their unique properties, such as high absorption coefficient,
long charge-carrier lifetime, high efficiency, low cost, etc.1−4 To further enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs,
many strategies have been investigated, such as solvent engineering,5,6 compositional engineering,3,7−11 interface engineering,12−14 and so on. Among these methods,
interface engineering has been widely used in PSCs and it was found
that the interface modification could lower the contact resistance,
improve the energy alignment, reduce the charge recombination, and
enhance the charge extraction. Several interlayers have been used
to enhance electron extraction and collection so as to improve the
device efficiency.14,15 Among them, metal oxides, such
as titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), tin dioxide
(SnO2), and polyelectrolytes, such as fullerene surfactant
(bis-C60), rhodamine 101, bathocuproine (BCP), etc. have been found
to be potential candidates to act as the cathode interlayer because
they can help to form good ohmic contacts between the cathode and
the perovskite film, which could substantially improve the device
performance and stability.11,12,16−19 However, for printed perovskite solar cells, the device performance
is sensitive to the interlayer treatment because it is much affected
by the interlayer thickness which is hard to control by using printing
techniques.20 Hence, the interlayer free
structure is desired.21

Besides the
interface engineering approach, compositional engineering
is thought to be another important method to enhance the perovskite
solar cell efficiency and stability. Previously, the compositions,
precursor aging condition, and precursor purity have been investigated
and the results showed that the perovskite thin-film crystallinity,
morphology, and device performance could be significantly enhanced
by optimizing the precursor solutions.7,9,10,22 Moreover, much lower
trap-state density and longer carrier diffusion length have been observed
in perovskite single crystals compared to that in polycrystalline
thin films.1 Hence, it is meaningful to
improve the perovskite thin-film quality for enhancing the device
performance. Meanwhile, investigation and analysis of film quality
in perovskite devices are important to get more insight into electrical
transport properties and enhance the device performance.

In
this study, we investigated the effects of both lead halide
quality and interface structure on perovskite solar cell performance
and found that the device using high-quality lead halide crystals
achieved a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 0.80 even without any electron
interlayer treatment. The device processed from high-quality PbI2 crystal without electron interlayer treatment exhibited a
short-circuit current density (Jsc) of
19.8 ± 0.6 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 ± 0.02 V, and a FF of 0.79
± 0.01, leading to a corresponding average PCE of 15.0%, and
the PCE could be further promoted to 18.0% by using mixed lead halide
crystal-based precursor. It was found that all of the photovoltaic
parameters, such as Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE were enhanced significantly by using the
high-quality lead halide crystals. Moreover, the lead halide quality
has a significant effect on the precursor solubility and high-quality
lead halide crystals could promote the solubility of the precursor
solution. Meanwhile, it was found that the high-quality lead halide
crystals could improve the film crystallinity, enhance light absorption,
increase the built-in field, and reduce the charge recombination.
Most importantly, the simple-structured electron and hole interlayer
free devices were achieved by using high-quality PbI2 crystals
and the devices exhibited a high PCE of 13.6 and 10.4% for glass and
flexible substrates, respectively. These results indicate that the
efficient printed perovskite solar cells could be realized by using
high-quality lead halide crystals without complex interlayer modification
involved.

2 Results and Discussion
The high-quality
precursor is processed with ultrahighly pure PbI2 crystals,
whereas low-quality precursor is processed with
commercial PbI2 powders. It is unexpected that the high-quality
crystals could enhance the precursor solubility, hence they are better
for high-concentration solutions. PSC devices with the structure of
indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag have been fabricated. Figure 1 shows typical current density
versus voltage (J–V) characteristics
of devices with different PbI2 qualities and different
electron interlayers. From Figure 1b and Table 1, it can be seen that the PSCs with low-quality PbI2 powder (denoted as control PSCs) delivered a PCE of 8.9%, with Jsc of 14.7 mA/cm2, Voc of 0.91 V, and FF of 0.63, whereas the PSCs using high-quality
PbI2 crystal showed a PCE of 15.0%, which was much higher
than that of control PSCs by 50–60%. The average Jsc, Voc, and FF parameters
are substantially enhanced to 19.8 mA/cm2, 0.96 V, and
0.79, respectively. For control PSCs (Figure 1c), the BCP interlayer treatment significantly
enhances the FF from 0.63 to 0.76, whereas devices with high-quality
PbI2 (Figure 1d) exhibited similar J–V characteristics without or with the electron interlayer such as
BCP. These results indicate that the charge accumulation is minimal
between perovskite/PCBM and Ag electrode for high-quality PbI2-based devices, which is desirable for simple device fabrication,
such as that of printed PSCs. In this case, the PbI2 precursor
quality plays an important role in determining the final device performance
regardless of whether the electron interlayer is involved or not.
Because during the device fabrication, the only difference between
these two kinds of devices is the PbI2 quality, and all
of the other conditions, such as the solvent used, materials used,
and fabrication conditions, are the same, we can conclude that the
performance difference is only caused by the PbI2 precursor
quality. Meanwhile, PbCl2 crystals and PbBr2 crystals exhibited similar trends with higher performance achievement
compared to that of low-quality PbCl2 powder and PbBr2 powder counterpart. It should be mentioned that the device
efficiency could be further improved to 18.0% by using MA0.7FA0.3PbI3–xClx perovskite layer based on high-quality PbI2 and PbCl2 crystals. The Jsc, Voc, and FF are 21.9 mA/cm2, 1.04 V, and 0.79, respectively. Moreover, the device also
exhibited negligible hysteresis for different scan directions (Figure S1). Correspondingly, the device based
on low-quality PbI2 and PbCl2 powder presented
a low PCE of only 14.2% (Figure 1e).

The results of steady-state current density and PCE at the
maximum
power point as a function of time are consistent with the J–V scan results, manifesting that
our devices are stable and the final result is credible (see Figure 2a,b). Furthermore,
it clearly shows that the high-quality PbI2 can enhance
the Jsc and PCE of devices compared to
those of the lower one. The J–V hysteresis behaviors of devices based on different precursors were
also measured along the forward (from −0.2 to 1.1 V) and reverse
(from 1.1 to −0.2 V) scans with a voltage step of 0.01 V and
a delay time of 100 ms, as shown in Figure 2c,d. The J–V curves of the forward and reverse scans are well coincident
for both devices with negligible hysteresis, which indicates that
the devices are very stable due to the fullerene passivation23,24 and the PbI2 quality is not related to the device hysteresis.
The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table S1. The incident photon-to-electron conversion
efficiency (IPCE) curves of both devices are shown in Figure 3a. The high-quality PbI2-based device shows higher IPCE value than that of the low-quality
one, ranging from 400 to 800 nm. The calculated Jsc values by integrating the product of IPCE and solar
irradiance are 15.5 and 19.3 mA/cm2 for the devices with
low-quality and high-quality PbI2, respectively. These
values were consistent with measured Jsc values derived from J–V curves. The enhancement in the IPCE suggests that high-quality PbI2 could enhance light absorption and charge transport and suppress
charge recombination.25,26

Dark current
analysis further reveals differences of devices with
high- and low-quality PbI2 precursors. We observed that
PSCs with high-quality PbI2 have a lower leakage current
at reverse bias and higher on-current at forward bias. A high rectification
ratio (defined as the ratio of forward-to-reverse bias current density)
of 1.3 × 103 has been achieved from dark J–V characteristics of the devices with high-quality
PbI2, whereas it is only 2.9 × 102 for
devices with low-quality PbI2 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The Voc is given by the equation:27,28Voc = (nkT/q) ln(Jsc/Js + 1), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature
in kelvin, q is the elementary charge, n is the ideality factor, and Js is the
(reverse bias) saturation current density. The Js values of devices with low and high-quality PbI2 are 1.9 × 10–2 and 8.6 × 10–3 mA/cm2, respectively. Hence, smaller Js indicates larger Voc, whereas
decreased Js implies reduced recombination
loss in the PSC device. Furthermore, in contrast to the devices with
low-quality PbI2 precursor, it is calculated that the devices
with high-quality PbI2 have a higher shunt resistance (Rsh) and lower series resistance (Rs), which is consistent with the inferior leakage current
and higher Jsc. Thus, the fill factor
is enhanced substantially.

To further figure out the PbI2 quality effect on the Voc and
related recombination properties, the
function between Voc and the logarithm
of light intensity was depicted. Generally, the Voc is related to the energy differences between the quasi-Fermi
levels of electrons and holes. In this case, the quasi-Fermi level
position is determined by the free-carrier concentrations, which are
affected by the balance between the photogeneration and recombination
rates.29 As shown in Figure 3b, Voc increases
linearly with logarithmic light intensity, and for a trap-free device,
the slope of δVoc versus kT/q should equal to 1. In our case, the
linear fitting suggests that the slope n = 1.1 and
1.38 for the PSC devices with high-quality and low-quality PbI2 precursors, respectively, implying that the Shockley–Read–Hall
recombination (monomolecular recombination) is more dominant in the
devices processed with low-quality PbI2 precursor,30,31 which indicates that the impurities or defects in the low-quality
precursor can increase trap sites and thus promote trap-assisted recombination.32 Hence, the charge recombination of high-quality
devices is suppressed due to lower trap density and the device performance
is enhanced. We also extracted the FF as a function of light intensity
to study the PbI2 quality effect on carrier extraction,
as shown in Figure S3. It was found that
the effective FF shows less dependence on different light intensities
for a high-quality PbI2 precursor-based device, indicating
that the recombination is minimal in this condition because the FF
is related to charge recombination and carrier lifetime.33,34

Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were taken in the dark at room temperature
to investigate
the electronic properties of MAPbI3 in actual devices with
respect to the doping properties.35,36 The capacitance
was measured against different bias voltages, with ac excitation amplitude
of 30 mV, at frequency of 100 kHz. For a Schottky diode, the junction
capacitance showed a bias dependence according to the Mott–Schottky
relation,37,38C–2 =
2(Vbi – V)/(A2qεε0N), where Vbi is the
built-in potential, V is the applied voltage, A is the device’s active surface, q corresponds to the elementary charge, ε accounts for the relative
dielectric constant of the perovskite (assumed to be 6.5 as determined
by the diffusion reflection),39 ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and N is
assumed as the doping density of perovskite. The Vbi which accounts for the difference of the equilibrium
Fermi levels at both sides of the contact could be estimated by the
voltage corresponding to the maximal of capacitance that equals the
flat-band condition. As shown in Figure 3c, the differences of Vbi and N in the devices were compared. We
attained 0.82 V of Vbi and 4.20 ×
1016 cm–3 of N from
the devices with the low-quality PbI2 precursor. The Vbi and N were respectively
enhanced to 0.93 V and 2.16 × 1016 cm–3 in the devices with the high-quality PbI2 precursor.
Because there are many trapped states and ion migration in the perovskite
thin films or at the interface and electrons and ions are easily trapped
at the interface, Vbi will decrease due
to the screening effect if electrons are trapped at interface states
and more ions are piled.40 The larger N value indicates an increase of the surface doping density,
which may be caused by charged impurities or defects of structure.
A higher doping concentration results in enhanced recombination between
the doped carrier and the photocarrier, leading to a large proportion
of trap-assisted recombinations; hence, the Jsc and FF are reduced. The Vbi for
the devices is in agreement with the Voc extracted from J–V characteristics.
The smaller Vbi of devices based on the
low-quality PbI2 precursor means lower driving force for
the photogenerated carriers to be separated in PSC,41 which indicates that the devices with a low-quality PbI2 precursor have higher energy barrier. Hence, the reduced Vbi resulted in an increased probability of recombination
and a decreased probability of charge-carrier extraction. This is
consistent with the recombination mechanism.42 The charge transport properties were also studied by using a thin-film
transistor diode. The perovskite thin film based on the high-quality
PbI2 precursor exhibited higher current and conductivity,
which is beneficial for efficient charge extraction and collection
(Figure 3d). These
results also correlate well with the J–V data and suggest that the high-quality PbI2 precursor could result in better device performance.

To verify
our views about film crystallinity, crystal size, and
light-harvesting ability, the measurements of scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV–vis absorption were
performed. As shown in Figure 4a, both perovskite thin films exhibited uniform and compact
morphology, and the average crystal size of the high-quality perovskite
film is larger than that of the low-quality one. It was thought that
the impurities introduce more nucleation sites and induce a heterogeneous
nucleation and crystal growth thus leading to smaller crystallites.
Larger crystal size also means lower crystal defect density and trap
sites existing in the thin films, which is beneficial for the efficient
charge transport and reduced charge recombination. This is also confirmed
by charge transport results. Thin-film crystallinity could be further
confirmed by XRD measurements. As shown in Figure 4c, the two MAPbI3 thin films exhibit
strong diffraction patterns at 14.2, 28.5, and 31.9°, which can
be assigned to (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal
perovskite phase, respectively.8 However,
the diffraction intensity of the high-quality film is much higher
than that of the low-quality one, demonstrating that the former has
better crystallinity and fewer defects, which is consistent with SEM
results. According to the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values
(Figure S4), the crystallite size of the
perovskite films could be estimated in terms of the Scherrer equation
to be around 453 and 628 nm for low-quality and high-quality PbI2-based thin films, respectively. Larger crystals mean less
grain boundaries existing in the thin films, indicating that the grain
boundaries and impurities-related defects are reduced. Because it
was speculated that the impurities could affect light absorption of
perovskite thin films due to the lower crystallite size in the perovskite
layer, the light absorption of the perovskite thin films with different
precursors were investigated through UV–vis spectroscopy (Figure 4d). Obviously, the
high-quality film exhibited increased light absorption in the range
of 300–800 nm. This can be attributed to the higher crystallinity
of the high-quality perovskite film.

To figure out the photoconversion processes associated
with the
quality of the PbI2 precursor in the perovskite films,
photoluminescence (PL) was carried out on both thin films, as shown
in Figure 5a. The high-quality
thin film exhibited a larger intensity of PL emission compared to
that of the low-quality film. Therefore, the perovskite MAPbI3 with high quality could help devices possess a lower defect
density and a lower charge recombination rate compared with the low-quality
one. Consequently, the performance is enhanced substantially. The
transiently photoexcited carriers were investigated by time-resolved
PL measurements on the basis of perovskite films deposited on glass
substrates. Perovskite thin films are known to be subject to two-carrier
recombination under high fluorescence, which results in a fast PL
decay.43,44 The PL decay of these two kinds of thin
films is shown in Figure 5b, and the fitted parameters are summarized in Table S2. The average PL lifetimes for perovskite
thin films prepared from high-quality and low-quality precursor were
calculated to be 80.26 and 10.72 ns, respectively. Combining the steady-state
and time-resolved PL study, the high-quality thin films displayed
higher PL intensity and a slower PL decay rate, which indicates that
the perovskite MAPbI3 with high quality has a high electron
transport rate and a low carrier recombination rate compared to those
of the low-quality counterpart.

(b) time-resolved PL spectra
of perovskite thin films deposited on glass substrates.

To further simplify the device fabrication step,
hole-transport-layer-free
(HTL-free) MAPbI3/PCBM planar heterojunction solar cells
were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag.
The hole-transport-layer-free devices have been reported in this structure,
and it has been found that PEDOT:PSS has less effect on the charge
transfer from MAPbI3 to the ITO electrode determined from
PL spectra; hence, the PEDOT:PSS interlayer could be avoided in this
structure.45−47 Without using the hole-transporting layer, the devices
are rapidly fabricated in comparison with devices containing hole-transporting
layers. The simple structure and simplified fabrication process provide
a potential for the commercialization of printing electronic devices.
As shown in Figure 6a, the hole-layer-free device exhibited a maintained Jsc of 20.1 mA/cm2, slightly enhanced Voc of 1.00 V, and decreased FF of 0.67. Hence,
the final device showed only a slightly decreased PCE of 13.5% compared
to that of the control device (14.9%) with the PEDOT:PSS interlayer.

solar cells fabricated on glass substrates with/without the PEDOT:PSS
hole transport layer. (b) J–V curves of perovskite solar cells fabricated on poly(ethylene terephthalate)

To investigate the universality of this structure and high-quality
precursor, we achieved flexible HTL-free perovskite solar cells on
PET substrates. The device fabrication method is similar to that of
the glass substrates. The J–V curve of the flexible perovskite solar cell is shown in Figure 6b. The flexible solar
cell devices achieved a best PCE of 10.4%, with a Jsc of 17.0 mA/cm2, a Voc of 0.97 V, and a FF of 0.63. The Jsc and FF slightly decreased compared to that of the glass
substrates, which may be due to the increased surface resistance of
the ITO electrode. The device hysteresis behavior was also checked,
and only a slight hysteresis behavior was observed, which may be due
to the trap states at the interface between ITO and perovskite thin
films (Figure S5).23,47

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have studied
the lead halide crystal quality
and interlayer structure effect on the performance of planar heterojunction
perovskite solar cells. The high-quality lead halide crystals could
promote the growth of perovskite crystals, which enhances the perovskite
film light absorption, reduces crystal defects, and suppresses charge
recombination. Moreover, a larger built-in field could be obtained
for a high-quality lead halide-based device, which could enhance the
charge collection and the charge transport. These advantages help
the devices with high-quality lead halide to improve the fill factor
to 0.80 and enhance the device performance substantially (from 8.9
to 15.0% for CH3NH3PbI3 and from
14.2 to 18.0% for MA0.7FA0.3PbI3–xClx). Meanwhile, HTL-free
devices were successfully fabricated by using the high-quality PbI2 precursor and exhibited a high PCE of 13.6 and 10.4% for
glass and PET substrates, respectively. This is important for simplifying
the perovskite solar cell fabrication process and could be the potential
choice for the printed PSCs.
