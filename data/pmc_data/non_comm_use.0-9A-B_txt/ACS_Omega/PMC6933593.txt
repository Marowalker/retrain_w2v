Cobalt (Co) nanoparticles (NPs) are produced in different
applications
and unintentionally generated at several occupational and traffic
settings. Their diffuse dispersion may lead to interactions with humans
and aquatic organisms via different exposure routes that include their
transformation/dissolution in biological media. This paper has investigated
the particle stability and reactivity of Co NPs (dispersed by sonication
prior to exposure) interacting with selected individual biomolecules
(amino acids, polypeptides, and proteins) in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). No or minor adsorption of amino acids (glutamine, glutamic
acid, lysine, and cysteine) was observed on the Co NPs, independent
of the functional group and charge. Instead, phosphate adsorption
resulted in the formation of a surface layer (a corona) of Co phosphate.
The adsorption of larger biomolecules (polyglutamic acid, polylysine,
lysozyme, and mucin) was evident in parallel with the formation of
Co phosphate. The dissolution of the Co NPs was rapid as 35–55%
of the particle mass was dissolved within the first hour of exposure.
The larger biomolecules suppressed the dissolution initially compared
to exposure in PBS only, whereas the dissolution was essentially unaffected
by the presence of amino acids, with cysteine as an exception. The
formation of Co phosphate on the NP surface reduced the protective
properties of the surface oxide of the Co NPs, as seen from the increased
levels of the released Co when compared with the nonphosphate-containing
saline. The results underline the diversity of possible outcomes with
respect to surface characteristics and dissolution of Co NPs in biological
media and emphasize the importance of surface interactions with phosphate
on the NP characteristics and reactivity.

==== Body
Introduction
Co metal is widely used in high wear-resistant
alloys and as a
binder in hard metals because of its excellent wear resistance, magnetic
and catalytic properties, as well as strength at high temperatures.
Nanoparticles (NPs) of Co and Co oxides are further used as pigments,
as catalysts, in magnetic fluids, and as contrast agents for medical
imaging.1 Their use and potential dispersion
via, for example, wear processes at occupational settings, from implant
materials, or tire studs at traffic settings may result in adverse
effects on humans and the environment. Repeated exposure to Co ion
concentrations exceeding 20 μg/L is reported to result in
risks for systemic toxicity.2 Exposure
to Co can furthermore induce asthma and acute illness including fever,
anorexia, malaise, breathing difficulties, and interstitial pneumonitis.3 However, Co is also a vital component of vitamin
B12, an essential compound for the well-being of humans,
plants, and animals.4

Nanosized particles
need special attention as they, in many cases,
pose a greater risk than larger sized particles on human health and
the environment.5,6 Tires with studs made of tungsten
carbide cobalt (WC-Co) are frequently used during the winter season
in the Northern countries. As a consequence, wear particles of W and
Co, some of nanometer size, have been observed in road dust.7−10 Workers in hard metal industries have further experienced negative
health effects from airborne Co,11 and
WC-Co particles have shown higher reactivity and generation of free
radicals (indicative of a higher toxic potency) compared with WC particles
and also release of Co ions.12−15

For risk assessment, it is important to understand
the dynamics
of reactions taking place at the outermost surface of NPs as it influences
their mobility, stability, and dissolution pattern.16−22 Surface adsorption of humic and fulvic acids, amino acids, and proteins21 to metal NP surfaces has been shown to take
place instantaneously upon environmental entry, forming an eco- or
biocorona.23 This corona formation has
further shown to influence NP dissolution, agglomeration, and cell
interactions.21,23,24

The adsorption of biomolecules (the biocorona) influences
the corrosion
properties, characteristics, and reactivity of the surfaces and wear
particles of CoCrMo alloys in hip implants.25 Literature findings furthermore report that proteins (albumin and
fibrinogen) enhance (catalyze) both the release of Co and the corrosion
process in saline (NaCl).26 The surface
oxide composition is important as minor dissolution has been observed
in cell media for Co3O4 NPs, whereas complete
dissolution was evident within 24 h for Co metal NPs (surface oxide
mainly composed of CoO).27 The effects
of biomolecule adsorption, forming biocoronas, on the dissolution
and reactivity of Co NPs are however poorly understood. This lack
of knowledge hampers risk assessments and accurate interpretations
of toxicological findings, both from human and environmental perspectives.

This paper focuses on the interaction between Co NPs and different
biomolecules of varying structure and properties under simulated physiological
conditions with the aims to: (i) deduce the trends in the adsorption
of biomolecules of different characteristics, (ii) explore if the
formation of a biocorona prevents the agglomeration of Co NPs in solution
and, hence, influence their stability and mobility, and (iii) investigate
the influence of biomolecule characteristics and biocorona formation
on the dissolution of Co NPs.

Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
is used in this study to mimic
the ionic strength (ca. 170 mM, mainly from NaCl) and pH of blood
(pH 7.4). The selection of amino acids (lysine, glutamine, glutamic
acid, and cysteine) is based on their different characteristics in
terms of net charge and functional groups at the same pH. Lysine is
positively charged and has an amine group as the functional group
on the side chain, glutamine is uncharged with an amide as the functional
group, glutamic acid is negatively charged with a carboxylate functional
group, and cysteine is uncharged with thiol (SH) as the functional
group that under certain conditions forms strong complexes with both
metallic surfaces and metal ions.29,30 Two oppositely
charged polypeptides were selected to investigate the effect of biomolecule
size and number of charged entities compared with the selected amino
acids: positively charged poly-l-lysine and negatively charged
poly-l-glutamic acid. A comparative study using polypeptides
and amino acids provides insight on how larger biomolecules with the
same functional groups affect the interaction with Co NPs. Studies
on the natural proteins lysozyme and mucin, for instance, of relevance
for the inhalation route, were performed in parallel to investigate
how the differences in protein structure and flexibility affect the
interaction with Co NPs. Mucin is a flexible, high-molecular-weight
(several MDa) glycoprotein produced in epithelial tissues of the mucous
membrane that lines most of the cavities in the human body, for example,
the digestive and respiratory tracts. Mucin is also important for
lubrication and may act as a chemical barrier that hinders the corrosion
process of metallic surfaces.31,32 Lysozyme is a small
compact globular protein that is present in saliva, tear fluids, and
mucus. Mucin and lysozyme are oppositely charged at pH 7.4 (mucin–net
negatively charged; lysozyme–net positively charged). Previous
studies show that the net charge of the protein can influence the
metal release process of metallic surfaces.33−35 These studies
revealed that metal surface interactions of negatively charged protein
bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly enhanced the extent of metal
release from both stainless steel and silver, whereas the interaction
with positively charged proteins such as lysozyme predominantly resulted
in a minor increase of the amount of released metal from stainless
steel and a significant reduction of released silver. Co has a high
affinity to phosphate and readily forms insoluble complexes.36 It is hence possible that Co preferentially
forms such complexes with phosphate rather than with the biomolecules
of this study. These aspects are important to address because Co phosphate
complexes present on the surface, and in solution, most likely will
result in different surface characteristics of the Co NPs (e.g., charge
and barrier effects on dissolution) compared with the corresponding
interactions with different biomolecules.

In this study, attenuated
total reflection Fourier transform infrared
(ATR–FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to probe the adsorption
of biomolecules to a layer of Co NPs deposited onto the ATR crystal
in situ. The released amount of Co ions in solution was determined
for different particle loadings and biomolecule concentrations using
atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Solution speciation estimations
were performed using the joint expert speciation system (JESS) to
deduce the trends of Co ion complexation to amino acids and phosphate.
The zeta potential (apparent surface charge) was estimated for the
Co NPs in PBS, 10 mM NaCl, and PBS buffer without chloride. Photon
cross-correlation spectroscopy (PCCS) was employed to assess the particle
stability and changes in particle size. The particle morphology and
composition (native dry particles and particles after exposure in
PBS and in PBS-containing biomolecules) were assessed by means of
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS). The composition of the outermost surface was determined
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Results and Discussion
Particle Characteristics under Dry Conditions
The TEM
micrographs of unexposed Co NPs under dry conditions show agglomerated
particles of polyhedral structure typically sized between 10 and 50
nm (Figure 1). The
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined
to be 10.7 ± 0.2 m2/g.27

Compositional analyses by means of X-ray diffraction
(XRD) revealed
CoO (main diffraction peaks at 42.5, 36.6, 61.7, 74.0, and 77.9—2θ)37,38 to be the predominating crystalline oxide. Its presence on the surface
was supported by high-resolution XPS measurements (Co 2p3/2: 780.1, 782.1, 785.5, and 786.5 eV; O 1s: 529.4 eV),27,39 though phase identification using this technique is only indicative
and not conclusive. The XPS findings further indicate the possible
presence of Co3O4 (Co 2p3/2 peaks
at 779.7, 781.5, 783.8, and 789.8 eV), an observation supported by
recent analyses by the authors using Raman spectroscopy.39 Its presence is not surprising as the surface
of CoO has been shown to readily oxidize to Co3O4 in air.39,40 As no diffraction peaks related to Co3O4 were observed, these results indicate its presence
in an amorphous state and/or in a minor quantity.

Particle Characteristics after Sonication
Metal NPs
have in general strong van der Waals forces, which make their driving
force for agglomeration relatively high. Sonication was therefore
required to prepare the particle dispersions for testing. However,
as previous findings have shown this step to largely influence dissolution
and the surface characteristics of metallic particles,41 such effects were investigated in this study.
This knowledge is essential to properly connect NP characteristics
prior to exposure with the observed transformations after exposure
of the same NPs. Co NPs in both non-sonicated and sonicated solutions
showed bands in the ATR–FTIR spectra (Figure 2), at 650–680, 550–600, and
380 cm–1, all attributed to Co3O4.37,42 The band at 675 cm–1 can
also be attributed to CoO (Tang et al. 2008). The broad plateau between
400 and 520 cm–1 includes several bands from both Co3O4 (e.g.,
519, 482 cm–1) and CoO (e.g., 455 cm–1).37 The band at 620 cm–1, attributed to Co3O4 (Tang, Wang et al. 2008),
was visible prior to sonication but disappeared after the sonication
steps, which may indicate a change of the Co3O4 (spinel) structure.

Figure 2 ATR–FTIR spectra for non-sonicated and sonicated
Co NPs
in ultrapure water and ethanol, respectively.

Changes in the outermost surface
oxide composition of the Co NPs
as a result of sonication were also observed by means of XPS. The
binding energy of the main Co 2p3/2 peak attributed to
Co3O4 shifted from 779.7 to 781.8 eV, and both
the main Co 2p3/2 peak at 780.1 eV and the O 1s peak attributed
to CoO at 529.4 eV disappeared. This corroborates the results of ATR–FTIR
spectroscopy that showed sonication to change the composition and
possibly also the thickness of the surface oxide.

Sonication
further influenced the dissolution of the Co NPs. 8%
of the total Co mass was dissolved after sonication in the stock solution.
As a result, the administered dose contained 92% NPs and 8% dissolved
ions, findings in line with previous observations on differences between
the nominal and the administrated dose of metal NPs.36

Changes in the Surface Characteristics of Co NPs as a Result
of Interactions with PBS and Biomolecules
The absorption
spectra, based on the ATR–FTIR measurements of Co NPs in PBS
in the presence and absence of amino acids, are presented in Figure 3 together with the
background spectra for PBS. The concentration of biomolecules used
is relatively close to what is expected under physiological conditions.43 The PBS solution showed (Figure 3B) peaks at 1077 and 989 cm–1, assigned to the monoprotonated (HPO42–) species,44 and a peak at 1640 cm–1 related to the bending mode of H2O.45

Figure 3 ATR–FTIR spectra collected after 5 min exposure
of Co NPs
in (A) saline and in PBS containing 146 mg/L lysine and (B) in PBS,
in PBS containing 146 mg/L lysine, glutamine, glutamic acid, or cysteine,
and pure PBS solution with MQ water as the background. The PBS solution
spectra are added for comparison (no Co NPs present). All spectra
have been offset for clarity.

In the presence of Co NPs, all conditions showed
bands at 1110
and 960 cm–1 that are attributed to the stretching
vibration of P–O bonds.36 The background
spectra for each solution (without Co NPs) were subtracted in each
case (Supporting Information, Figure S1).
A shift between 25 and 40 cm–1 compared with the
P–O bands in PBS was evident for all cases and attributed to
the formation of Co phosphate surface complexes in which Co ions influence
the vibration of the original HPO42−.46 No evident peaks that could be attributed to
any amino acid interactions with the Co NPs were observed, such as
δas(NH3+) at 1626–1629
cm–1 and δs(NH3+) at 1526–1527 cm–1 for lysine, or
1668–1687 cm–1 for ν(C=O) of
glutamine (see Figures 3 and S1), though some overlap with the
broad H2O band at 1645 cm–1 cannot be
excluded.47 From the results, it is evident
that the surface interactions are dominated by the formation of Co
phosphates and that any adsorption of the small-sized amino acids
is minor or not possible to observe with the ATR–FTIR technique.
Measurements in saline and water showed the adsorption of the amino
acids (see Supporting Information, Figure
S2). A minor increase in peak intensities of the phosphate bands was
observed with time (data not shown), indicative of a nearly complete
adsorption already within a few minutes. The dominance of phosphate
over amino acids in terms of surface affinity is corroborated by equilibrium
calculations that show a higher affinity between Co and phosphate
ions compared with Co ions and lysine or glutamine molecules in solution
(Table 1).

a Only components with a fraction
of Co ions exceeding 1% are included in the table.

According to the equilibrium calculations in Table 1, Co ions in solution
have a higher affinity
to cysteine (thiol functional group) compared to phosphate. However,
no or minor adsorption of cysteine was possible to be observed by
means of ATR–FTIR spectroscopy. This indicates a difference
in affinity between Co ions and cysteine in solution compared with
its affinity to adsorb at the oxidized Co NP surface. From an electrostatic
(Coulomb) perspective, a positively charged amino acid is expected
to adsorb onto the negatively charged Co NP surface (see zeta potential
measurements below), whereas an uncharged amino acid would not adsorb.
However, the high ionic strength of the PBS solution results in very
short-range electrostatic interactions, and the driving force may
hence not be strong enough for any exchange between the adsorbed phosphate
species at the surface and any amino acid molecules in solution.

Zeta potential measurements were conducted to investigate how the
adsorption of phosphate affected the surface charge of the Co NPs
(Figure 4). The most
negative potential (p < 0.05, Student’s t test) was measured in the phosphate buffer (0.02 mM phosphate).
All measurements in PBS resulted in very broad potential distributions,
from negative to positive potentials, making Coulomb interactions
between negatively charged phosphate groups and some positively charged
Co NPs plausible (Figure S3). The results
clearly show that the adsorption of multivalent phosphate anions (Figure 3) generates a more
negatively charged surface (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Average zeta potentials of Co NPs (10 mg/L) at pH 7.4
in 10 mM
NaCl (considering a higher concentration of NaCl corresponding to
a high ionic strength that causes a screening effect in the zeta potential
measurements, only 10 mM NaCl is used here), PBS (>150 mM ionic
strength),
and phosphate buffer (20 mM). The error bars represent the standard
deviation from at least three independent measurements. The stars
indicate statistically significant differences (p < 0.05, Student’s t test). Note—broad
zeta potential distributions (see Supporting Information, Figure S3).

ATR–FTIR spectra are presented in Figure 5 for Co NPs after
interactions with polylysine,
polyglutamic acid, lysozyme, and mucin in PBS for different time periods.
From the spectra, it is evident that the amide bands (amide I and
II) from the adsorbed biomolecules dominate the spectral region between
1200 and 1800 cm–1, and the band present at 1625
cm–1, attributed to the water bending mode, grows
in the negative direction with time. Curve fitting using Gaussian
functions (details given in Figure S5)
was used to resolve the negative spectral band in addition to the
bands corresponding to the adsorbed proteins and polypeptides (amide
bands).

in PBS, 146 mg/L polyglutamic acid in PBS; (B) 146 mg/L lysozyme in

The observed vibrational peak positions for Co
NPs exposed to different
polypeptide and protein solutions are summarized in Table 2.

The position of the amide I bands (the main band between
1645 and
1655 cm–1) indicates mainly an α-helix or
unordered secondary structure of the adsorbed biomolecules.48 The very weak band at approximately 1670 cm–1 may indicate that some of the molecules have other
secondary structures, such as turns.48 The
fitting procedure became exceedingly difficult to perform in the case
of the 2 h exposure in mucin because of the large negative water bending
band at ≈1625 cm–1. It should be noted that
additional uncertainties exist, such as contributions from side chains47 and difficulties in fitting in the case of broad
bands composed of several vibrational modes.49

As evident from Figure 5, the amplitude of the negative water band grew with time,
which indicates that less water was probed in the spectra compared
with the background (Co NPs in PBS) collected before the introduction
of biomolecules and subtracted from each spectrum when the biomolecules
were introduced (Figure 6). As will be shown in the next section, the dissolution of the Co
NPs was relatively rapid (at least 20% of the total mass dissolved
within 1 h). As the dissolution of the surface oxide of the Co NPs
results in a thickness reduction of the Co NP film, the effective
refractive index of the medium above the ATR crystal is reduced.50 This makes the probing depth of the IR beam
in the ATR measurements shorter, which in turn makes the amount of
probed water smaller compared to the background that is collected
at the start of the experiment.50 In all,
this results in an FTIR spectrum with a water band in the negative
direction. This assumption was confirmed as the stretching vibrations
of water (≈3000–3700 cm–1) followed
the same trend as the bending mode at 1625 cm–1.
An increased adsorption of both biomolecules and phosphate anions
(the biocorona) also results in a reduction of water molecules that
are associated to the Co NP surface and thus in a lower amplitude
of the band related to water in the spectra. This effect was however
minor as the adsorption of polypeptides and proteins was fast and
did not increase in amplitude after 2 min of exposure, whereas the
negative water band amplitude continued to increase within the exposure
time frame (up to 2 h) (Figures 5 and 6). An increased amplitude
of the negative water bending mode band was also observed for the
amino acid solutions (Figure S5). The adsorption
of proteins and biomolecules was irreversible with respect to rinsing,
as evident from the lack of changes in the ATR–FTIR spectra
upon extensive rinsing using PBS (data not shown).

the amide bands of adsorbed polypeptides and
proteins and the presence of H2O (bending mode) for the
Co NPs in PBS. (A) Polyglutamic acid, (B) polylysine, (C) lysozyme,
and (D) mucin.

Peaks attributed to phosphate adsorption (1110
and 960 cm–1) were also observed in Figure 5, similar to the ATR–FTIR
spectra of Co NPs
in PBS with different amino acids (Figure 3). In the case of polylysine, these peak
positions resemble the positions of the solution spectra of PBS, whereas
their positions were shifted for the other biomolecules in a similar
way as observed for the amino acids (Figure 3). One plausible explanation for the lack
of peak shifts in the presence of polylysine is the ionic bonding
between the positively charged amine group (NH3+) of the adsorbed polylysine side chain and the negatively charged
phosphate anion (HPO42–). This conformation
might not induce a change in the vibration mode of HPO42– in the same way as observed for the Co phosphate
complexes observed for Co NPs in PBS.

Several intermolecular
interactions can influence the adsorption
of biomolecules on surfaces, including ionic (electrostatic) interactions
(both repulsive and attractive), hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions,
hydration forces, acid–base interactions, and van der Waals
forces.51 The most important driving forces
for protein adsorption are often regarded to be hydrophobic and ionic
interactions, combined with an entropy gain originating from the release
of small molecules (e.g., water and counterions) from the interface
between the biomolecule and the surface and in some cases conformational
changes of the protein during the adsorption.52,53 Hence, the size of the biomolecule will largely influence its ability
to adsorb onto surfaces. In the case of larger biomolecules compared
with amino acids, a higher amount of contact points between the Co
NPs will result in a gain in entropy upon adsorption, as opposed to
the amino acids. Adsorption was evident for the polypeptides and proteins
regardless of their charge. From this, it follows that the gain in
entropy upon adsorption originates from dehydration from the hydrophilic
Co NPs as a result of displaced water molecules and other small molecules.
Adsorption took place for both the negatively charged polyglutamic
acid and the net negatively charged mucin on the average negatively
charged Co NP layer deposited onto the ATR crystal. Some positively
charged Co NPs may have been present in the Co NP layer (Figure S3). However, the electrostatic interactions
are, as discussed above, expected to be of a very short range because
of the high ionic strength of the solutions.

The ATR–FTIR
results were corroborated by TEM findings,
as illustrated for unexposed Co NPs and Co NPs exposed in PBS, in
PBS + lysine, and in PBS + polylysine, after 1 and 24 h (Figure 7). EDS data (not
shown) indicate a predominance of Co, P, and O (sometimes also Na)
(indicative of Co phosphate) when exposed in PBS (P/Co atomic ratio:
0.36–0.42) and in PBS + lysine (P/Co atomic ratio: 0.24–0.56),
whereas the exposure in polylysine resulted in particle surface layers
predominantly rich in Co, O, and C (no or minor content of P) as well
as features (no evident particles left) with the P/Co atomic ratio
between 0.10 and 0.30. The latter observation is in concordance with
the lack of peak shifts for the phosphate peaks in the case of polylysine,
as observed with ATR–FTIR spectroscopy (see Figure 5), which implies the formation
of Co phosphate species in solution or their presence within the outermost
part of the biocorona rather than that adsorbed to the Co NP surface.
Unexposed Co NPs showed only the presence of Co and O (Figure 1). Similar observations were
made after 24 h with the Co particles still left after 24 h for all
conditions, which means no complete dissolution within this time frame.

Changes in Particle Stability and Dissolution Related to the
Adsorption of Phosphates and Biomolecules
Studies were conducted
to assess whether the adsorption of a “corona”, that
is, of phosphate species and biomolecules of different characteristics,
would influence the extent and pattern of Co NP dissolution and the
colloidal stability of Co NPs.

Scattered light intensity levels
from the NPs in solution were rapidly and substantially reduced within
24 h of exposure for all biomolecule conditions and also for Co NPs
exposed in PBS only, as illustrated in Figure 8 for the selection of biomolecule-containing
solutions. A reduction in scattered light intensity indicates the
agglomeration and sedimentation of NPs, showing that the van der Waals
forces were higher than any repulsive electrostatic or steric forces
from the adsorbed phosphate and/or polypeptides and proteins. Increasing
scattered light intensities were observed for some early time points
(<1 h), indicative of larger sized agglomerates momentarily entering
into the path of the laser beam during the PCCS measurements.

Rapid sedimentation disabled the possibility for
detailed particle
size distribution measurements with time. The particle sizes in solution
were in the range from 400 to 5000 nm during the first 1 h of exposure.
However, there was not a clear tendency of changes in particle size
with time. After 24 h, the intensity was reduced by 40–180
times to levels less than 5000 counts/s. These low and largely varying
light intensities between different sampling times and biomolecule
conditions up to 24 h, and poor curve fitting for correlation functions
in PCCS, suggest the predominant formation of micrometer-sized agglomerates
and almost complete sedimentation within 24 h.

Because of the
rapid particle agglomeration and sedimentation for
all exposure conditions already within 24 h, differences in dissolution
behavior are only displayed after 1 and 24 h. The release data after
168 h are presented in Figures S6 and S7 in the Supporting Information.

The adsorption of phosphate
on Co NPs (ATR–FTIR, Figures 3 and 4) resulted in 4.5–6
times higher released amount (per
mass) of Co in the case of PBS compared with saline (Figure 9A). It is possible that the
adsorbed phosphate can destabilize surface Co species by weakening
the Co–O bonds, which is the opposite trend of metals such
as Fe when it comes to the effect of phosphate on dissolution.54 Complexation of phosphate to free Co ions in
solution can in addition enhance the extent of dissolution as the
system is pushed further away from equilibrium conditions in terms
of dissolved Co ions.

Figure 9 Co dissolution per mass (%) for different Co NP loadings
in PBS
(pH 7.4) with and without amino acids. (A) Saline, PBS; (B) PBS with
and without 14.6 and 146 mg/L amino acids, 1 h; (C) PBS with and without
146 mg/L amino acids, 1 h; (D) PBS with and without 146 mg/L amino
acids, 24 h.

No significant differences in soluble Co were observed
for the
different amino acid concentrations or when compared with PBS at a
particle loading of 1 mg/L (Figure 9B). The released fractions of Co in solution after
1 and 24 h from the Co NPs in PBS with and without the presence of
amino acids (146 mg/L) are presented in Figure 9C,D for three different particle concentrations
(1, 10, and 20 mg/L Co NPs). Except for the exposure with cysteine,
the results show 20–60% of the Co NP mass to be dissolved within
1 h followed by considerably slower release rates with time (24 h—Figure 9D and 168 h—Supporting Information), independent of particle
and amino acid concentrations (Figure 9B–D).

Observed dissolution rates are in
general agreement with the reported
dissolution rates in physiological cell media of the same Co NPs.27

Speciation modeling calculations (Table 1) showed that Co ions
have the highest affinity
to phosphate when compared with all amino acids investigated, except
for cysteine. These calculations support higher fractions of released
Co in solution in the presence of cysteine (Figure 9). This may be related to a higher affinity
between cysteine and soluble Co ions, from which follows an increased
complexation and hence driving force for dissolution.55 As no significant differences in agglomerate size (PCCS)
could be discerned for the Co NPs (10 mg/L) in PBS with and without
cysteine (146 mg/L), differences in surface area do not play a significant
role for the comparison of dissolution between different biomolecules.
It should be noted that Table 1 does not include insoluble Co phosphates as they are missing
from the JESS database. Recent predictions using Visual MINTEQ show
that insoluble Co3(PO4)2 dominates
the formation of Co phosphate salts in PBS.27 The lack of reduced amounts of Co observed in solution (Figure 9) indicates however
the minor precipitation of Co complexes/compounds up to 24 h. The
phosphate concentration in this study (20 mM) is higher than that
under more realistic conditions (ca. 0.38 mM)43 and can hence amplify the importance of phosphate relative to more
realistic conditions. Nonetheless, PBS is a very widely used buffer
for NP transformation investigations, and Co phosphates are still
expected to form under physiological conditions.4

The released fractions of Co per mass from the Co
NPs exposed for
1 and 24 h (168 h in Supporting Information) in PBS in the presence of polypeptides, mucin, or lysozyme are
presented in Figure 10 for two different biomolecule concentrations and Co NP loadings.
Under these conditions, 15–45% of the Co NP mass was dissolved
into solution within 1 h, that is, to a generally lower extent than
that observed in the case of PBS and amino acids (35–55%).
Previous literature findings show dissolved amounts of Co (from 100
μg/L Co NPs in PBS) of 15.6% after 2 h.27 However, as the sonication time of that study was only 3 min, compared
to 15 min in this study, the observed findings show that a prolonged
sonication time can result in increased dissolution rates also in
the stock solution and alter the surface properties of the sonicated
NPs compared to dry conditions (Figure 2). The results are in concordance with the literature,
showing effects of sonication on particle reactivity and surface composition.27 The only exception was lysozyme after 1 h for
the lower particle loading and the biomolecule concentration. It is
hypothesized that the small size of lysozyme in solution can increase
its rate of exchange between solution and the surface and therefore
enhance the extent of metal release at a larger rate than the other,
larger, biomolecules such as mucin and polypeptides.

Figure 10 Dissolution of Co NPs
of different concentrations (1 and 10 mg/L)
in PBS with and without polypeptides or proteins of different concentrations
(14.6 or 146 mg/L): (A) 1 mg/L Co NPs in PBS containing 146 mg/L polypeptides/proteins,
(B) 10 mg/L Co NPs in PBS containing 146 mg/L polypeptides/proteins,
(C) 1 mg/L Co NPs in PBS containing 14.6 mg/L polypeptides/proteins,
(D) 10 mg/L Co NPs in PBS containing 14.6 mg/L polypeptides/proteins.

The higher particle loading (10 mg/L) generally
resulted in lower
amounts of released Co after 1 h compared to the lower loading (1
mg/L), possibly because of the formation of larger particle agglomerates
that facilitates the adsorption and biocorona formation of the relatively
large polypeptides and proteins. Higher loadings will, in addition,
generally result in a higher released Co ion concentration in solution.
Higher concentrations in solution should reduce the dissolution rates
compared with the findings for lower loadings, as equilibrium conditions
will be reached at lower NP concentrations.56 These effects were not observed any more after 24 h for which more
(1 mg/L Co NPs), or similar/slightly reduced (10 mg/L Co NPs), amounts
of Co per mass were dissolved compared with the exposure in PBS only.
Exposure up to 1 week (168 h) showed no or only minor effects of the
adsorbed biomolecules on the extent of Co dissolution (Figures S6 and S7). The results illustrate that
the formation of a biocorona of polypeptides or proteins combined
with phosphate species at least initially hinders (up to 1 h) the
dissolution of Co NPs in PBS.

Even though no large differences
in the dissolution pattern could
clearly be discerned related to the charge or number of charged entities,
the results imply that the negatively charged amino acids and polypeptides
with the same functional group (carboxylates), glutamic acid and polyglutamic
acid, resulted in somewhat higher released quantities after 1 h compared
with the positively charged lysine and polylysine (amine groups) (Figure 11). These findings
are in line with previous findings that show the metal–surface
interactions of negatively charged proteins (BSA) to significantly
enhance the extent of metal release from both stainless steel (of
different grades) and silver, whereas the interaction with positively
charged proteins (lysozyme) predominantly resulted in a minor increase
of the amount of released metals from stainless steel and a significant
reduction of released silver from massive silver.33−35

Figure 11 Released
amount of Co per mass from Co NPs: (A) 1 mg/L and (B)
10 mg/L after 1 h in PBS with and without the presence of amino acids,
polypeptides, or proteins in a concentration of 146 mg/L. The stars
indicate statistically significant differences (p < 0.05, Student’s t test).

The correlation between the charge of biomolecules
and dissolution
was, in this study, less evident with a higher release of Co after
1 h in the case of lysozyme (net positively charged) compared to mucin
(net negatively charged). However, it is hypothesized that the small
compact globular structure of lysozyme increases its exchange rate
between solution and the surface and therefore enhances the metal
release process compared to the other more flexible biomolecules (mucin
and polypeptides) as observed for lower particle and biomolecule concentrations.

Initially hindered release processes in the presence of adsorbed
polypeptides/proteins are in general concordance with the trends often
observed for corrosion and metal release.57 The adsorbed molecules will temporarily block the surface areas
for ongoing dissolution/corrosion processes. However, slower corrosion/release
processes such as ligand exchange that take place after certain time
periods can result in enhanced dissolution,57 even though some exceptions from this trend have been reported for
corrosion.58 There is moreover a possibility
that the biomolecules may slowly replace the adsorbed phosphate.21

The observed trend of initially slower
dissolution in the presence
of proteins is opposite to what has been observed for the massive
Co metal interacting with BSA in saline.26 This implies that different proteins may have different dominating
modes of interaction with the Co surface, as BSA was hypothesized
to catalyze corrosion reactions leading to the faster dissolution
of NPs. These effects were not observed in this study.

Conclusions
This paper focuses on the interaction between
Co NPs and biomolecules
of different properties in PBS in order to understand their potential
adsorption and biocorona formation and how it influences particle
stability, particle characteristics, and the dissolution of Co NPs.
The sonication step that was performed to disperse the Co NPs in PBS
prior to exposure to the biomolecules resulted in a slightly altered
composition of the surface oxide of the Co NPs compared with dry conditions
and induced some particle dissolution in the stock solution. This
preparatory step may be the reason why the dissolution rates of the
Co NPs in PBS were faster compared with the previously reported rates.

The high affinity of phosphate to Co ions and the Co NP surface
resulted in the formation of strong surface complexation that largely
hindered the adsorption of small amino acids. The presence of a phosphate-rich
corona reduced the protective properties of the CoO/Co3O4-containing surface oxide on the Co NPs, assessed from
increased dissolution.

Compared to the influence of PBS, the
presence of amino acids of
different characteristics had no or minor influence on the dissolution
of Co NPs, with cysteine as the main exception. The dissolution of
Co NPs was rapid with 15–40% dissolved within 1 h of exposure.
In addition to phosphate adsorption, the larger biomolecules (polylysine,
polyglutamic acid, mucin, and lysozyme) adsorbed to the Co NPs forming
a biocorona, which resulted in the reduction of the dissolution rate
during the first hour. These effects did, however, not last after
longer exposure periods (24–168 h). The presence of negatively
charged biomolecules possibly increased the release of Co compared
with the positively charged biomolecules, with lysozyme being an exception.

The results imply that Co NPs will not be relatively long-lived
if internalized by organisms, for example, in the human lung or within
the gills of a fish. The presented results underline the diversity
of possible outcomes with respect to the surface and particle characteristics
and their dissolution pattern depending on the presence of different
types of biomolecules, as well as the importance of phosphate for
the resulting NP surface composition and properties. These aspects
are important to consider as the media for eco- and nanotoxicological
assays, for example, typically vary with respect to both phosphate
and biomolecule contents.21

Materials and Methods
Investigated Particles
Co NPs (product code CO-M-028M-NP.1000N,
LOT # 1211392979-814, <100 nm, metal purity-99.9%) were purchased
from American Elements, USA. According to previous particle characterization,
the average primary particle size was 25 ± 8.8 nm (based on TEM
imaging), the BET surface area was 10.7 m2/g, and CoO was
the main constituent of the surface oxide.27

Chemicals and Solution Preparations
PBS was used to
simulate the human blood serum, commonly used for bioaccessibility
studies.59 Its chemical constituents include
8.77 g/L NaCl (CAS: 7647-14-5, Lot: 17E314108, assay 100.1%, VWR Chemicals),
1.28 g/L Na2HPO4 (CAS 7558-79-4, Lot: # BCBV2075,
assay ≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.36 g/L KH2PO4 (CAS 7778-77-0, Lot: 16K154102, assay 99.8%, VWR Chemicals)
and has an ionic strength corresponding to 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02 M
phosphate buffer. The 20 mM phosphate buffer (PBS buffer without chloride)
included 1.28 g/L Na2HPO4 and 1.36 g/L KH2PO4. NaCl (150 mM) contained 8.77 g/L NaCl. All
salts were dissolved in ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity,
Millipore, Sweden). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 by means of 50% NaOH
(batch no. 08D280509, made in EC-EMB 45053, EC label: 215-185-5, Prolabo). l-Lysine (MW: 146.19 g/mol, CAS 56-87-1, Lot: #BCBT1990, assay
≥98%, PCode: 101813210, Sigma-Aldrich), l-glutamine
(MW: 146.14 g/mol, CAS: 56-85-9, Lot: # BCBJ2148V, BioUltra, PCode:
101455953, Sigma-Aldrich), l-glutamic acid (MW: 147.13 g/mol,
CAS 56-86-0, Lot: #BCBH3883V, Assay ltra3, ECPCode: 101420757, Sigma-Aldrich),
and l-cysteine (MW: 121.16 g/mol, CAS 52-90-4, Lot: #SLBQ4967V,
assay ≥98%, PCode: 1002305403, Sigma-Aldrich) were all dissolved
directly in the PBS solution to a concentration of 146 mg/L (1 mM).
Poly-l-lysine hydrobromide (MW: 30 000–70 000
g/mol, CAS: 25988-63-0, Lot: #SLBS0150V, PCode: 1002509720, Sigma-Aldrich)
and poly-l-glutamic acid sodium (MW: 15 000–50 000
g/mol, CAS: 26247-79-0, Lot: #096K5103V, PCode: 1001412838, Sigma-Aldrich)
were dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 146 mg/L. Lysozyme from
chicken egg white (lyophilized powder, protein 5, MW: 14.1 kDa, CAS:
12650-88-3, Lot: #SLBT5160, PCode: 1002515139, Sigma-Aldrich) and
mucin from bovine submaxillary glands (Type I-S, MW: 7 MDa, CAS: 84195-52-8,
Lot: #SLBS0651V, PCode: 1002519367, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved
directly in PBS to a concentration of 146 mg/L.

The selected
concentrations of the amino acids are relevant to physiological conditions.60 The investigated concentrations of the polypeptides
and proteins were the same as for the amino acids, in order to have
comparable conditions. Even though these concentrations are different
from real biological conditions, this fundamental study only reflects
the conditions using one kind of amino acid, polypeptide or protein
separately in each solution and not combined.

Biomolecule Adsorption Studies
The ATR–FTIR
technique, using a Bruker Tensor 37 FTIR spectrometer with a platinum
ATR–IR accessory, was employed to study the adsorption of different
biomolecules to the Co NPs. The ATR–IR accessory consists of
a diamond crystal with an angle of incidence for the IR beam of 45°.
For investigations of dry Co NPs, a deuterated triglycine sulfate
(DTGS) detector equipped with a polyethylene window was used with
a relatively low wavenumber (>ca. 250 cm–1).
A  mercury
cadmium telluride  detector with a ZnSe window was used for
the in situ adsorption experiments on Co NP films in order to have
a greater sensitivity compared with the DTGS detector, however limiting
the working wavenumber range to >ca. 650 cm–1.

A total of 256 scans were collected with a resolution of
4 cm–1 in the experiments using amino acids and
512 scans
in the studies using polypeptides and proteins. The Co NPs (a particle
loading of 25 mg in 10 mL ethanol) were dispersed by means of tip
sonication for 15 min (Branson Sonifier 250, constant mode, output
2) that delivered an acoustic energy per liter of 1.18 × 106 J/L.41 Approximately 400 μL
of the sonicated Co NP solution was transferred onto the ATR–IR
crystal by means of a pipette directly after dispersion, followed
by drying for approximately 2 h at ambient air conditions. This procedure
allowed ethanol evaporation and NP layer formation on the crystal.
All spectra were collected when such NP layers were exposed to different
aqueous solutions. Background spectra were collected for the Co NP
layer in PBS only, followed by measurements in the biomolecule solutions
of interest. Separate spectra with biomolecules in PBS showed no peaks
related to the bulk solution species of the biomolecules at the studied
concentrations of this study. This means that the detected signals
of biomolecules originate from their adsorption to Co NPs. All experiments
were performed in duplicate, and a spectrum was collected every fifth
min up to 1 h for the experiments in the amino acid solutions and
up to 2 h in the case of the polypeptide and protein solutions. At
the end of the experiments, PBS was used to rinse the Co NP layer
to assess if the adsorption of the biomolecules was irreversible or
not.

The limit of detection (LOD) in terms of adsorption of
an equivalent
layer of amino acids was estimated to ca. 10%, that is, when amino
acids adsorbed to an extent exceeding 10% of the surface, a signal
can be detected (see Supporting Information for details).

Metal Release Measurements
A stock solution with a
concentration of 1 g NPs/L was prepared in an acid-cleaned glass vial
by dispersing 6 mg Co NPs (weighted by XP26 DeltaRange Microbalance,
Mettler Toledo) in 6 mL of ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity,
Millipore, Sweden) using tip sonication (Branson Sonifier 250, constant
mode, output 2) for 15 min. To prepare the biomolecule–Co NP
solutions, amino acids, polypeptides, or proteins solutions (ca. 20
mL) of each concentration were transferred into an acid-cleaned 60
mL PMP Nalgene jar from which an appropriate volume of the freshly
prepared Co NP stock solution was added to Co NP concentrations of
10 and 1 mg NPs/L. For a sample with 1 mg/L Co NP loading, 0.02 mL
of NP stock solution was added into a 19.98 mL solution containing
amino acids and polypeptides or proteins. For the 10 mg/L Co NP loading,
0.2 mL of the NP stock solution was added into 19.8 mL of the biomolecule-containing
solution. At the beginning of each experiment, a dose sample (stock
solution added into ultrapure water and acidified directly after preparation)
was prepared in an acid-cleaned plastic vial (25 mL) in order to determine
the actual added amount of Co NPs (the administered dose) as it may
differ from the nominal dose as shown for metal NPs.41 Each set of experiments to be analyzed for the released
Co concentration in solution using AAS included a dose sample, a blank
sample (biomolecule solution without Co NPs), and triplicate samples
of the biomolecule-exposed Co NP solutions (see below). The dose samples
were immediately acidified to pH < 2 using 65 vol % ultrapure HNO3. Samples with biomolecule-Co NPs were placed in an incubator
(Stuart S 180) at bilinear agitation conditions (37 °C, 12°
inclination, 22 cycles/min) for 1, 24, and 168 h (1 week). After exposure,
solutions of 4.5 ± 0.1 mL were transferred to centrifuge tubes
and ultracentrifuged (Beckman Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge, 50 000
rpm, 1 h) to remove the nondissolved particles from the solutions.
Note that the ultracentrifugation treatment effectively makes the
exposure time in solution somewhat longer than the nominal investigation
time periods for dissolution (1 h, 24 h, and 1 week)

Nanoparticle
tracking analysis (Nanosight NS300, Malvern, Sweden) measurements
confirmed that no detectable Co NPs were left in solution after ultracentrifugation.
After the centrifugation step, 3.7 mL of the top volume of the centrifuged
solution was transferred to acid-cleaned 10 mL vials and acidified
to a pH < 2 by using 65% ultrapure HNO3 for subsequent
AAS measurements.

Chemical Analysis of Released Co in Solution by means of AAS
Graphite furnace AAS (PerkinElmer, AAnalyst 800) was used to analyze
the amount of released Co in solution for exposures with a particle
loading of 1 mg/L. Standard solutions with known Co ion concentrations
(10, 30, 60, and 100 μg/L) were prepared in 1% ultrapure HNO3 together with a blank sample (1% ultrapure HNO3). Mg(NO3)2 was used as a matrix modifier during
the analysis. The LOD was approximately 3.6 μg/L (the mean value
of blank samples + 3 times the standard deviation of the blank samples).
A calibration standard was used for quality control and run every
fourth sample to ensure no memory effects. Calibration and analysis
were repeated if the quality control sample deviated more than 10%.
Flame AAS was employed to assess the released Co in solution for higher
particle loading (10 mg/L). This calibration curve included a blank
sample (ultrapure water) as well as 1, 3, and 10 mg/L Co ion standard
solutions. The 3 mg/L solution was used as quality control and run
every fourth sample. The LOD was approximately 0.20 mg/L. Calibration
and analysis were repeated if the quality control deviated more than
10%. Before the AAS analysis of the samples, Co ions in the biomolecule
control samples were made and measured, which indicated that the AAS
method worked well. The results showed the described method to be
valid for all Co-biomolecule exposures with recoveries >83%. The
dose
sample results were compared with those of digested Co NP samples
(digestion with 65% HNO3 and H2O2), and a complete dissolution of the Co NPs was proved in the dose
samples.

Changes in Particle Morphology and Composition Assessed Using
TEM Combined with EDS
The morphology and structure of unexposed
and precipitated Co NPs from the different solutions were analyzed
using TEM (Hitachi HT7700 microscope operating at 100 kV) after the
metal release investigations in PBS, lysine, and polylysine solutions
for 1 and 24 h. The precipitated particles were transferred via a
pipette directly from the jars onto TEM copper grids, coated with
holey carbon films (Ted Pella), and left to allow the aqueous solution
to evaporate under ambient air condition. All images were collected
in bright-field mode.

TEM was also performed using a JEOL 200
kV 2100F field emission microscope operated in scanning beam mode
(scanning transmission electron microscopy) combined with EDS microanalysis
using a windowless silicon drift detector X-MaxN TLE from
Oxford Instruments and the Aztech software. A beryllium sample holder
was used when performing the chemical analyses.

Compositional Analyses of the Outermost Surface Oxide Using
XPS
XPS (Kratos AXIS UlraDLD, Kratos Analytical) measurements
were performed for compositional analysis of the outermost surface
of the Co NPs (pristine-unexposed NPs) and Co NPs after sonication
in ultrapure water and in ethanol, respectively, with the aim to investigate
if the sonication treatment would change the surface oxide composition.
Dry NPs were transferred with a spoon directly onto an adhesive carbon
tape for XPS analysis. Co NPs dispersed in ultrapure water and in
ethanol were dispersed in the same way as the NP stock solutions for
the metal release experiments (described above), pipetted onto a carbon
tape (total volume about 200 μL), and dried at ambient air conditions.
High-resolution spectra of Co 2p, O 1s, and C 1s were acquired on
two different areas (each ≈0.4 mm2) using a monochromatic
Al X-ray source (150 W), a pass energy of 20 eV, and a linear background
correction, averaging nine scans for each element and area. All binding
energies were corrected to the adventitious carbon C 1s peak (C–C,
C–H) set at 285.0 eV.

Particle Size and Zeta Potential in Solution
Measurements
of the particle size in solution were performed using dynamic light
scattering spectroscopy by means of PCCS (Nanophox, Sympatec GmbH,
Germany). The main purpose was to investigate the stability of Co
NPs dispersed in PBS with and without amino acids, polypeptides, or
proteins. All measurements were performed at an ambient laboratory
temperature (25 °C) after 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min exposure
in solution. A volume of 1 mL was pipetted into the PCCS cuvettes
and measured for 180 s. All measurements were run twice. Standard
latex particles sized 100 nm (Malvern instruments) were used as quality
control prior to the analysis to ensure the accuracy of the measurements.

The zeta potential of the Co NPs was determined using laser Doppler
microelectrophoresis using a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern
Instruments, U.K.) at 25 °C. Triplicate measurements were performed
in PBS, in 10 mM NaCl (pH 7.4), and in phosphate buffer (20 mM) without
NaCl.

Speciation Modeling of Released Co in Solution
The
JESS version 8.360 model was used for chemical
equilibrium speciation calculations of Co in PBS and amino acid solutions.
The temperature was set to 37 °C and the redox potential to 300
mV based on measurements using an Inlab redox electrode (Mettler Toledo,
Sweden).

Statistical Analysis
Student’s t test analysis was done in EXCEL, with a double-side mode to compare
the difference between the results of several groups of metal release
samples.
