The
isomerization of estragole to trans-anethole
is an important reaction and is industrially performed using an excess
of NaOH or KOH in ethanol at high temperatures with very low selectivity.
Simple Ru-based transition-metal complexes, under homogeneous, ionic
liquid (IL)-supported (biphasic) and “solventless” conditions,
can be used for this reaction. The selectivity of this reaction is
more sensitive to the solvent/support used than the ligands associated
with the metal catalyst. Thus, under the optimized reaction conditions,
100% conversion can be achieved in the estragole isomerization, using
as little as 4 × 10–3 mol % (40 ppm) of [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3] in toluene, reflecting a total turnover number
(TON) of 25 000 and turnover frequencies (TOFs) of up to 500
min–1 at 80 °C. Using a dimeric Ru precursor,
[RuCl(μ-Cl)(η3:η3-C10H16)]2, in ethanol associated with P(OEt)3, a TON of 10 000 and a TOF of 125 min–1 are obtained with 100% conversion and 99% selectivity. These two
Ru catalytic systems can be transposed to biphasic IL systems by using
ionic-tagged P-ligands such as 1-(3-(diphenylphosphanyl)propyl)-2,3-dimethylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide immobilized in 1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-2,3-dimethylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide with up to 99% selectivity and
almost complete estragole conversion. However, the reaction is much
slower than that performed under solventless or homogeneous conditions.
The use of ionic-tagged ligands significantly reduces the Ru leaching
to the organic phase, compared to that in reactions performed under
homogeneous conditions, where the catalytic system loses catalytic
performance after the second recycling. Detailed kinetic investigations
of the reaction catalyzed by [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3] indicate that a simplified kinetic model (a monomolecular reversible
first-order reaction) is adequate for fitting the homogeneous reaction
at 80 °C and under biphasic conditions. However, the kinetics
of the reaction are better described if all of the elementary steps
are taken into consideration, especially at 40 °C.

1 Introduction
Trans-anethole is a naturally occurring alkylbenzene,1 which can be extracted from anise or fennel oils,2,3 albeit with variable proportions of the cis isomer as an impurity.
Extraction of trans-anethole from natural sources
cannot supply the growing market (food, drugs, and cosmetics),4−7 generating the need for a synthetic alternative. For industrial
purposes, only trans-anethole is of use, as the cis
isomer has a higher toxicity and unpleasant organoleptic properties.8−10 Currently, trans-anethole is obtained by estragole
isomerization (Scheme 1), promoted by an excess of NaOH or KOH.11,12 However, there are a number of disadvantages for this process, including
the requirement of high temperatures (>200 °C), low conversion
in anethole (∼60%), a lack of stereoselectivity (trans/cis
ratio 82:18), and the significant amounts of basic wastes that are
generated.

Scheme 1 Isomerization of Estragole to Trans-Anethole
To overcome these
limitations, several protocols using homogeneous13−16 and heterogeneous17,18 metal-based catalysts have been
developed.1 The best results were obtained
using Ru(IV) catalysts in homogeneous systems (conversions and trans-anethole selectivities of up to 99%).16 Alternatively, heterogeneous systems show only moderate
selectivities for the trans isomer (85–88%) with conversion
of around 86–98%.17,18 However, the search
for more efficient and selective systems, capable of attaining green
and sustainable approaches to trans-anethole, is
desirable19−21 and is an on-going challenge for the relevant scientific
communities. Indeed, catalytic estragole to trans-anethole isomerization, using green reaction media, has already
been reported using ethanol–glycerol and ethanol–H2O.16 Similarly, ionic liquids (ILs)
have emerged as one of the most important and investigated solvents
for several green chemical transformations.22−26 The combination of these liquids with charge-tagged
ligands has proven to be a valuable tool in organometallic catalysis.27−30 The ionic modification of these ligands confers a particular solubility
profile that makes catalyst/product recovery possible and often improves
the activity of the catalytic species compared to that of the parent
tag-free analogue.31 Moreover, new selective
processes can be envisaged by changing the solubility and diffusion
of substrates and products in the active phase of a reaction.32−34 However, little is known about the rate law and kinetics of this
apparently simple isomerization reaction in which the desired product
(trans isomer) is the thermodynamic product. An intimate knowledge
of the reaction law and intrinsic kinetics is necessary to design
more active and selective catalysts in both homogeneous and multiphase
conditions. To address these issues, we have investigated, in detail,
the kinetics of estragole isomerization under both homogenous and
biphasic conditions using Ru, Rh, and Pd catalyst precursors dissolved
in organic solvents, immobilized in ILs, and under “solventless”
conditions.

Herein, we present the development of homogeneous
systems for estragole
to trans-anethole isomerization and the direct transposition
for biphasic systems containing ILs and charge-tagged ligands. Moreover,
the kinetics aspects of this reaction, in homogeneous and biphasic
systems, have also been investigated. Finally, we show that this simple
catalytic reaction has complex kinetics.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Estragole Isomerization
in Classical Organic
Solvents
In our study, we first compared the efficiency of
some of the most popular and most used alkene isomerization complexes,1 for the transformation of estragole to trans-anethole. [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3] 1, [RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3] 2, [RhCl(PPh3)3] 3, and
[PdCl2(NCPh)2] 4 were evaluated
for this transformation (entries 1–15, Table 1; for detailed information see Table S1). [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3] complex 1 is the most active among these catalysts
and demonstrates 100% substrate conversion to anethole in 1 h and
a trans selectivity of 95%. Using a ratio of estragole/1 of 100, the reaction could be performed in air without any changes
to the conversion or selectivity (entries 1 and 2, Table 1). However, visual changes could
be observed when the reaction was not performed in an inert medium,
indicating partial decomposition of the catalyst (Figure S1). As previously reported, despite the high stability
of precursor 1 in the solid state, in solution it quickly
decomposes when exposed to air.35 In addition,
the reaction could be performed under solventless conditions with
no significant changes in the selectivity (entries 3 and 4, Table 1 and Figure S2). Indeed, in just 5 min, the reaction was completed,
with a selectivity of 92% for the trans isomer at 80 °C. This result is best reported
under solventless conditions using [RuCl3(AsPh3)2]·MeOH at very high temperatures (>200 °C)
for 5 h.36

Under the optimized reaction conditions
(Tables S2 and S3), 100% conversion (92% selectivity in trans-anethole) can be achieved for the estragole isomerization using
as little as 4 × 10–3 mol % (40 ppm) of 1, with a total turnover number (TON) of 25 000 and
turnover frequencies (TOF) of up to 500 min–1 (entry
8, Table 1 and Figure S3). Furthermore, the removal of the peroxides
(entries 5–8, Table 1) present in the substrate is essential in avoiding catalyst
deactivation.37,38

The influence of temperature
(from 40 to 80 °C) was evaluated
for estragole isomerization using 1 (Figure 1 and Table S4). Hydride catalyst 1 has been demonstrated
to be an efficient catalyst for estragole isomerization with a high
potential for this reaction, due its high activity at low loadings
of the catalyst and at low temperatures (40 °C) (entry 9, Table 1). It is important
to note that at full estragole conversion, the formed cis-anethole is transformed into the trans isomer with the increasing
reaction time (Figure 1), that is, the cis isomer is reduced from 7% after 2 h to 3% after
24 h at 60 °C. Further attempts to improve the selectivity of
estragole isomerization were made using dimeric Ru precursors already
described in the literature as being efficient for estragole isomerization.15,16 Ru precursors [RuCl(μ-Cl)(η6-C6H5OCH2CH2OH)]25 and [RuCl(μ-Cl)(η3:η3-C10H16)]26 were explored
under homogeneous conditions (entries 16–27, Tables 1 and S7). As expected, dimeric Ru(II) complex 5 showed a conversion
of 91% in 4 h and a trans-anethole selectivity of
97%, whereas dimeric Ru(IV) precursor 6 was more active
and selective for this type of transformation, showing a conversion
of 99% and a selectivity of 99% after a 1 h reaction (entries 16 and
20, Table 1). Second,
we reasoned that the introduction of phosphorous ligands, phosphites
and phosphines, with different electronic and steric properties, should
exert some influence in terms of the activity and trans/cis selectivity
of the reaction.

60 °C,
and ○ 80 °C. Reaction conditions: estragole 2.0 mmol,
estragole/1 ratio of 10 000, toluene 0.5 mL, and
estragole filtered over aluminum oxide.

As expected, bimetallic compound 5, in the presence
of the ligand, P(OEt)3, showed a greater reaction speed
and selectivity, compared to that of the system in the absence of
phosphite, reaching a conversion of 100% in 1 h and a trans selectivity
of 99% (entry 18, Table 1). When P(OEt)3 was added to the system containing precursor 6, no changes were observed in the conversion and selectivity,
but the reaction was faster than in the system in the absence of phosphite
(entries 20 and 22, Table 1). The same behavior was observed when PPh3 was
used (entry 27, Table 1). Reactions were also performed using toluene as the solvent, and
the activity and selectivity decreased dramatically when compared
to that of the system with ethanol (compare entries 22 and 26, Table 1). It is certain that
phosphorous ligands play a key role on the catalytic activity of these
bimetallic precursors. However, we cannot discard the fact that the
good activities and selectivities occur mainly as a result of the
nature of the solvent used, probably due to the easier hydride formation,
which constitutes the first step of the process.15

We also investigated how the process is affected
by changing the
catalyst loading (for detailed information see Supporting Information
(SI), Table S8). We observed that decreasing
the quantity of Ru from 1 to 0.04 mol % did not modify the ratio of
trans/cis. Alternatively, lower metal loadings (0.01 mol %) resulted
in lower selectivities for the trans isomer. Under the optimized reaction
conditions, a total TON of 9800 and TOFs of up to 125 min–1 were obtained (entry 25, Table 1 and Figure S7). Nevertheless,
small amounts of 6 were sufficient for performing the
selective estragole to trans-anethole isomerization
in shorter reaction times with selectivities of up to 99%.

2.2 Estragole Isomerization in ILs
To
obtain a biphasic system for estragole isomerization, experiments
were conducted in a two-phase homogeneous system containing ILs by
the direct transposition of the homogeneous system for the biphasic
one. Initially, we evaluated the solubility of estragole and anethole
in three imidazolium-based ILs at 80 °C (Scheme 2; Table S5). The
highest solubility of anethole and estragole was found in BMI·NTf2 and the lowest in nPr(OH)MI·NTf2. BMI·PF6 (Scheme 2) showed an intermediate solubility and was
chosen for preliminary isomerization biphasic tests.

Scheme 2 Estragole
Solubility (S80 °C) in ILs
Initially, we performed tests in biphasic systems containing
the
IL BMI·PF6 (Table S6).
After 20 min, the system reached 100% conversion with a selectivity
for trans-anethole of 96%. The biphasic isomerization
of estragole in the presence of BMI·PF6 was straightforward,
and essentially the same conversion and selectivities were obtained
compared to those by the homogeneous test. The product phase was collected
by simple decantation at the end of the reaction, followed by subjection
to ICP-AES analysis (Table 2). Although, a high Ru content was measured (160 ppm), the
IL phase could retain part of the Ru, as a total of 216 ppm of Ru
was present in the reaction mixture (0.0052 mmol Ru/2.43 g). As expected,
the reaction rate of the biphasic system was slower than in the homogeneous
one, probably due to the mass transfer limitations that will be discussed
in the Section 2.3. As the anethole is recovered by phase separation, and the main
contaminant is Ru, we decided to verify whether the addition of the
ionophilic phosphine ligands (Figure 2) would improve the immobilization of the Ru complex
in the IL phase (Table S6).

Figure 2 Ionophilic ligands used.

c Ru content in the organic phase.

The addition of four equivalents of phosphine L1 relative
to Ru completely inhibited the catalytic activity, which is expected
as an excess of phosphine ligands has been shown to have detrimental
effects on the isomerization activity.39 Indeed, an excess of P-containing ligands
inhibits the formation of the 16-electron Ru–H catalytic active
species (see below). When one or two equivalents of the ligand were
used, good results could be obtained, whereas larger amounts led to
long reaction times. Changing the nature of the ionophilic phosphine
resulted in no observable changes in the catalytic results. ESI(+)-MS
experiments indicated the substitution of the phosphine, present in
the precursor 1, by the ionophilic phosphine, through
the observation of species [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)L1] (m/z = 751.0842) and [RuHCl(CO)(L1)2] (m/z =
1092.0302) in the reaction solution (Figure S6). This indicates that this ligand increases the immobilization of
this catalyst in IL systems, reducing the lixiviation and contamination
of the organic phase.

Attempts were made to recycle the ionic
phase containing the catalyst. A new charge of the fresh substrate
was added, and the reaction proceeded for 1 h; remarkably, changes
in catalytic activity could be observed (entry 1, Table 2). The ionic phase completely
lost its catalytic activity with a second charge of the substrate.
Recycling experiments performed with the ionophilic ligand, L1, presented the same behavior, although the Ru content in
the oil phase was lower, resulting in a small drop in the catalytic
activity after the first cycle. The isomerization of estragole with
BMI·NTf2, promoted by 6/P(OEt)3, gave a conversion of 83% in 3 h and a trans selectivity of 98%
(entry 1, Table 3).
To improve the catalytic activity, we decided to use an IL with similar
characteristics to ethanol.

b Selectivity
for trans-anethole.

An experiment using the IL nPr(OH)MI·NTf2 was performed, and the reaction reached
99% conversion in
30 min with a selectivity of 99% for trans-anethole
(entry 2, Table 2).
In this case, the estragole was only partially miscible with nPr(OH)MI·NTf2, and a biphasic
system was obtained. By comparing the reaction performed with BMI·NTf2 and that performed with nPr(OH)MI·NTf2, it became clear that even in a biphasic system, the catalyst
was much more active and selective if an OH-functionalized IL is used.
Interestingly, the amount of IL could be reduced 5-fold and used as
a “liquid support” (entries 2 and 4, Table 2). Thus, the reaction using
P(OEt)3 or PPh3 as ligands gave an identical
conversion and the same selectivity as that obtained using larger
amounts of IL (compare entries 2 and 3 and entries 4 and 5, Table 2). However, the time
for total conversion increases when the amount of IL decreases, indicating
that the isomerization is probably under mass transfer control.

In addition, a new family of phosphite ligands (L4 and L5; synthesis is described in Experimental
Section) that bear an imidazolium fragment and
consist of a versatile ligand class for IL biphasic catalysis was
synthesized and applied to the estragole isomerization. The ionophilic
phosphine ligands, L1–L3, and the
ionophilic phosphite ligands, L4 and L5,
were added to the reaction system to prevent the metal contamination
in the final oil phase (as previously observed for the system using
the [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3] precursor) with no pronounced
changes in the catalytic results. No meaningful changes were observed
for the conversion and selectivity of these systems when compared
to those of the parent tag-free analogue (e.g., compare entries 1
and 2, Table 4).

2.3 Kinetic Modeling Study
of Estragole Isomerization
Kinetic studies were carried out
to determine a rate law for the
systems considered more environmentally friendly, that is, under solventless
conditions. Experiments were performed for the homogeneous and biphasic
systems containing Ru precursor 1 and estragole. As a
first approach, we assumed that the system is composed of a monomolecular
reversible first-order reaction according to previous works, such
as for the isomerization of butene and pentene (Scheme 3).40

Scheme 3 Monomolecular
Model of Estragole Isomerization
The equilibrium concentrations and thermodynamic properties
(ΔG°, ΔH°,
ΔS°) of the allylbenzene conversion on
its internal
isomers at different temperatures have already been reported. For
example, at 75 °C the ratio of allylbenzene and cis and trans
isomers are 0.157, 3.81, and 96.03%, respectively.41

The concentrations of the substrate ([E]) and products cis-anethole ([C]) and trans-anethole ([T]),
with respect to time, are given by the solution of the first-order
ordinary differential equations (ODEs), as defined by eqs 1–3 1   2   3  The relative kinetic constants for this model
were calculated by the fitting of the ODEs’ numerically integrated
solution to the experimental data using the kinetic simulator software
Dynafit.42 These constants were evaluated
for the model proposed in Scheme 3 at three different temperatures. The agreement between
the prediction model and the experimental data could be measured qualitatively
by the simultaneous fit of eqs 1–3 to experimental results, and
the best agreement was obtained for the reaction performed at 80 °C
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 Simultaneous
fit of eqs 1–3 to experimental data for estragole
isomerization at 80 °C. Reaction conditions: estragole 2.0 mmol,
estragole/1 ratio of 10 000, solventless, and
estragole filtered over aluminum oxide. Experimental data: ■,
estragole; ▲, trans-anethole; and ○, cis-anethole. Model prediction: blue line, estragole; red
line, trans-anethole; and green line, cis-anethole.

This agreement could
also be supported quantitatively by the residual
sum of squares (S) presented in Table 5. The best S value was obtained for the reaction performed at 80 °C, with
a residual sum of squares43 of 457 (entry
3, Table 5). This result
supports the assumption that the entire system can be described in
terms of the first-order reversible reactions. However, when lower
temperatures were used, the difference between the prediction and
the experimental data increases (entry 1, Table 5). These results suggest that besides the
intrinsic limitation of the monomolecular model, in which virtual
kinetic constants are valid only for a catalytic concentration, the
model is also not suitable at low temperatures, mainly because the
known important steps of the reaction, such as the formation of the
catalytic active species, are neglected. Indeed, the formation of
the 16-electron catalytic active species [Ru(H)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2] from 1 should be considered (see below).

c See Table S9 for details.

The kinetic
constants determined for the reaction performed at
80 °C are shown in Table 6. The relative constants, k1 and k2, rule the selectivity of the isomerization
at the beginning of the reaction. The undesired cis isomer is formed
at a rate that depends mainly on k2 and
the substrate concentration, as k2 ≫ k3. However, the removal rate of the cis isomer
is related to the relative kinetic constant, k–3, as k–3 ≫ k–2. Therefore, as soon as the substrate
is consumed, the liquid rate of cis formation decreases due to cis
→ trans conversion, causing the appearance of a maximum of
around 25% of the cis-anethole relative concentration
(see green curve, Figure 3). In the equilibrium, the selectivity is controlled mostly
by the ratio K = k–3/k3 ≈ 19 (95% trans-anethole), as k–1 and k–2 are approximately zero. Considering
that k2 < k1 and K > 1, the trans isomer is the kinetic and
thermodynamic product in this reaction.

An interesting result about this
model is its good agreement for
the two-phase system containing IL (entry 4, Table 5 and Figure 4). Obviously, biphasic systems are strongly influenced
by mass transfer between the organic and catalytic phases,44 and to neglect this can be problematic. However,
for a preliminary fitting of the concentration of the reaction components
over time, this approach can be useful. At short times, it is likely
that the reaction is slow due to the low concentration of the substrate
in the catalytic phase of the IL. This may be a consequence of the
slow diffusion and low solubility of the substrate in the IL.

fit of eqs 1–3 to experimental data for biphasic
estragole isomerization at 80 °C. Reaction conditions: estragole
2.0 mmol, estragole/1 ratio of 10 000, L1 2 equiv and BMI·PF6 0.5 g. Experimental data: ■,
estragole; ▲, trans-anethole; and ○, cis-anethole. Model prediction: blue line, estragole; red
line, trans-anethole; and green line, cis-anethole.

Therefore, this model
is adequate for describing the kinetics of
the reaction performed in ILs, and the complex behavior of the biphasic
systems could be mathematically condensed in the relative kinetic
constants. However, as demonstrated, this monomolecular model is not
adequate for describing the experimental kinetic data obtained at
40 °C (Table S9).

In the face
of the limitations found using the monomolecular model,
a simplified model based on the metal hydride mechanism (Scheme 4) was evaluated.

Scheme 4 Metal Hydride Mechanism
Steps IV, VII, and VIII were omitted, and the sequential
monomolecular
steps (coordination, insertion/migration, β-elimination, and
discoordination) were combined in single steps, characterized by kinetic
constants, as follows: k5/–5 (steps
II and III); k6/–6 (steps VI and
X); and k7/–7 (steps V and IX).
Thus, a simplified mechanistic model could be proposed for catalytic
estragole isomerization (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Mechanistic Model Proposed for Catalytic Estragole
Isomerization
(Herein, X0 are 16-Electron Ru–H Catalytic Active
Species ([Ru(H)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2])
Assuming a first-order dependence of the reaction
rate with the
catalyst and substrate concentrations, the system of ODEs that describe
the kinetic model can be defined by eqs 4–10 4   5   6   7   8   9   10  A good fit
was obtained for estragole isomerization
at all temperatures used (Figures 5 and S9), as characterized
by low values of S (Table S10). This result reinforces the hypothesis that the step of formation
of active species should be considered, especially at low temperatures
(e.g., compare k4 and k5 for the reaction performed at 40 °C, entries 1
and 3, Table 7). In
addition, values k5, k6, and k7 were in agreement
with the literature, that is, the relative kinetic constant for estragole
coordination (k5) is greater than the cis- and trans-anethole coordination (k6 and k7). Also,
as expected, k6 is greater than k7.

The proposed simplified mechanistic model was also
evaluated for
considering the steady-state approximation for the concentration of
reaction intermediates and the mass balance of metal species using
the mathematical Software Maple 15.00 (Figure S10). A good agreement between the experimental data and the
reaction rate based on the Bodenstein approximation was also achieved.
Thus, the reaction rate could be described as presented in eq 11, where [XT] is the metal complex concentration used. 11  

3 Conclusions
The isomerization of estragole
to trans-anethole
can be easily accomplished by Ru-based catalysts under homogeneous,
IL biphasic, and “solventless” conditions with selectivities
of >99% at complete estragole conversions. TOFs of 125–500
min–1 can be achieved using simple Ru(II) or Ru(IV)
catalyst precursors, such as [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3] or [RuCl(μ-Cl)(η3:η3-C10H16)]2 in toluene, ethanol, ILs, or
under solventless conditions. Although this reaction can be transposed
to IL biphasic conditions using ionic-tagged P-ligands, the system
cannot be reused in view of the high sensitivity of the catalytic
active species. The removal of the peroxides present in the substrate
is essential to not deactivate the catalytic active species. The selectivity
of this reaction is more sensitive to the solvent/support used than
the ligands associated with the metal catalyst. The monomolecular
kinetic model (monomolecular reversible first-order reaction) is adequate
for fitting the homogeneous reaction at 80 °C and under biphasic
conditions. However, the kinetics of the reaction is better described
if a mechanistic model containing elemental steps (such as migratory-insertion
and β-elimination) is used, indicating that the step of formation
of active species should be considered, especially at 40 °C,
along with the generation of unsaturated 16-electron Ru–H catalytic
active species.

Considering Bondenstein approximation, the reaction
follows the
rate law . Therefore, the use of well-defined 16-electron
Ru–H catalyst precursors is key for obtaining a more easily
recyclable catalytic system for the isomerization of alkylbenzenes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General
All manipulations
of complexes
were conducted under Ar using dry boxes or standard Schlenk techniques.
Chemicals were treated as follows: toluene distilled from Na/benzophenone,
[RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3], [RhCl(PPh3)3], and [PdCl2(NCPh)2] from
Aldrich, acetone-d6 and CDCl3 (Cambridge Isotope) and other solvents were used as received. [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3],45 ILs (BMI·PF6, BMI·BF4, and BMI·NTf2),46L1,47L2,47 and L3(48) were synthesized according to literature
procedures. Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed using
a Shimadzu GC-2010 instrument equipped with a capillary column RTx-50
(30 m; 0.25 mm i.d.) using 4-methoxy-1-propylbenzene as an external
standard. GC–MS data were recorded with a Shimadzu QP2010.
ESI-MS experiments were performed using a Micromass Q-Tof micro. NMR
spectra were recorded on a Varian instrument at 400 MHz (1H), 100 MHz (13C), or 162 MHz (31P) using SiMe4 or 85% H3PO4 as standards.

4.2 Typical Isomerization Procedure in the Homogeneous
System
In a glovebox, estragole (2.0 mmol, 298 mg), the isomerization
catalyst (0.020 mmol), and the solvent (0.5 g) were charged in a Schlenk
flask. The system was heated to 80 °C and kept under stirring
for predetermined times. Samples were taken periodically for GC analysis.
The reaction products were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance
of hydrogen (1H NMR) (Figure S3) and quantified by GC (Figure S4).

4.3 Typical Isomerization Procedure in the Biphasic
System
In a glovebox, estragole (2.0 mmol, 298 mg), the catalyst
precursor (0.020 mmol), the solvent (0.5 g), and IL (0.5 g) were added
in a Schlenk flask. The system was heated to 80 °C and kept under
stirring for predetermined times. The reaction products were quantified
by GC by removing the top phase (organic phase) diluted in diethyl
ether.

4.4 Hydrogenation of Estragole for 1-Methoxy-4-propylbenzene
In a one-type reactor (Fisher Porter stainless) were added 15 g
of estragole and 0.5 g of Pd/C 10% (0.464 mol % Pd). Total conversion
was observed for the p-propilanisol (1-methoxy-4-propylbenzene)
after 3 h at a temperature of 85 °C and 26 bar hydrogen pressure.
The product was characterized by GC–MS and stored to be used
as an external standard (ES) in the chromatographic analysis.

4.5 Determination of Estragole and Anethole Solubilities
in ILs
To a glass reactor with an external heating jacket
(Figure S11), 0.700 g of IL and 1.500 g
of estragole or anethole (trans/cis: 96/4) were added. The system
temperature was raised by circulating warm water in the external jacket
and was monitored with a thermometer inserted in the biphasic mixture.
After the mixture was allowed to stand for 10 min at a temperature
of analysis under vigorous stirring (600 rpm) using a magnetic bar,
the agitation was reduced and maintained at approximately 60 rpm for
5 min to allow phase separation. With the aid of a glass Pasteur pipette,
previously heated with a heat gun, samples were removed from 200 mg
of the ionic phase. About 100 mg of 1-methoxy-4-propylbenzene was
added as an external standard, and three extractions with diethyl
ether were carried out. The extracted fractions were pooled and analyzed
by GC. The solubility of estragole or anethole in IL was calculated
by eq 12. In cases in
which the preheating of the Pasteur pipette was not sufficient to
prevent phase separation, due to cooling of the mixture, the pipette
containing the sample was heated with the heat gun until the mixture
became homogenous again avoiding preferential loss of a phase on the
walls of the pipette. Solubility measurements were made in duplicate
and are presented in a mean ± standard deviation format. 12  

4.6 Determination of Metal Content in Samples
The decomposition
of the samples was assisted by microwaves (MAD)
using Multiwave 3000 oven (Anton Paar, Austria) and quartz bottles.
The sample was weighed with the aid of a pipette into a small glass
container, which was placed inside the quartz vial. The samples were
decomposed in triplicate, using 5 mL of HNO3 and 1 mL of
HCl. The determination of Ru was performed using ICP-OES equipment
(Perkin Elmer Optima 4300 DV) with a primary argon flow of 15 L/min,
an argon auxiliary of 0.2 L/min, and an argon nebulizer of 0.7 L/min.
The wavelengths used were 240.272, 349.894, and 279.535 nm.

4.7 Synthesis of Ionophilic Ligand L4
In a typical synthesis,
a round-bottom Schlenk flask was charged
with dry 1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(2.80 g, 4.13 mmol), triethylamine (0.420 g, 4.13 mmol), and dry CH2Cl2 (20 mL) and cooled to 0 °C. Then, freshly
distilled PCl3 (0.190 g; 1.38 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was added dropwise; the ice bath was removed,
and the reaction was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The solvent
was removed under vacuum, and the product was extracted with dry acetone
(3 × 5 mL) to remove the insoluble HNEt3Cl. Yield:
