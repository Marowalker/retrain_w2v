Raman
optical activity (ROA) spectra of proteins hold a lot of
information about their structure in solution. To create a better
understanding of the ROA spectra of, among others, the intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs), involved in neurodegenerative diseases,
the effect of conformational disorder and dynamics on the ROA spectra
was studied. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of small
ensembles of model peptides with increasing disorder show that the
ROA patterns of α-helical and polyproline II (PPII) structure
reflect the average backbone angles in the ensemble. The amide III
region in the ROA spectra of the α-helical peptides is shown
to retain its typical −/+/+ pattern, while the amide III region
of PPII secondary structure diminishes in intensity with increasing
structural disorder. The results show that the ROA spectra of IDPs
hence more likely stem from short stretches of well-defined PPII helices
rather than a very flexible chain. Further DFT calculations support
that mixing of PPII with helical secondary structure is consistent
with experimental spectra of IDPs, while mixing with β-strand
results in spectral patterns that are not observed experimentally.
The detailed information obtained from these results contributes to
a better understanding of the spectrum–structure relation.

Introduction
Over the past decades,
Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra have
been shown to be uniquely sensitive to the solution structure of biomolecules.1,2 Nevertheless, the use of ROA as a complementary structural elucidation
technique in structural biology is not widespread. Exactly because
of its strong structural sensitivity, the detailed interpretation
of the spectroscopic signals is very challenging. Since ROA provides
unique spectral patterns for inter alia peptides,3 proteins,1 glycoproteins,4,5 and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs),6,7 there
is a clear incentive to create a deeper understanding of the structure–spectrum
relationship. Especially proteins such as IDPs are challenging to
characterize by standard techniques.8 As
these proteins are involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, there is a strong
motivation to develop structure elucidation techniques that are complementary
to, for example, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methodologies.8

The strength of Raman spectroscopies in
the study of dynamic systems
stems from the very short time scale of the scattering process (∼3.3
× 10–14 s for a vibration with wavenumber 1000
cm–1), which is much smaller than that of conformational
changes.9 The spectra are therefore a superposition
of snapshot spectra arising from all conformations that the protein
adopts in solution. Conventional Raman spectra of proteins arise from
molecular vibrations in both the side chains and the backbone of the
protein. ROA on the other hand is a chiroptical technique as it is
measured as the difference in the right- (IR) and left-handed (IL) circularly polarized
components in Raman scattered light. Because of its sensitivity to
chirality, ROA mainly records signals from the most rigid parts of
the protein. Therefore, the experimentally observed ROA spectral patterns
mainly arise from amide bond and skeletal stretching vibrations in
the backbone of the protein and thus depend on the secondary structure
of the protein.1 While the most important
secondary structure elements such as α-helix and β-sheet
can readily be identified from a protein’s ROA spectrum, the
detailed interpretation of ROA spectra is elusive.10 Therefore, in the past decade, several studies have been
performed using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate Raman
and ROA spectral patterns to aid in the interpretation of the experimental
patterns.11,12 Both for peptides3,13,14 and proteins,15−18 the interpretation of the experimental
spectra based on DFT calculations has been reported. In other approaches,
DFT calculations of model systems such as poly-l-alanine
peptides were used to support the general understanding of the relationship
between protein structure and the ROA spectrum.19−24

Recently, our group has reported the creation of an ROA database
to study the relationship between the secondary structure and the
corresponding ROA patterns.10 This database
consists of a large collection of ROA spectra, each one calculated
for a HCO-(l-Ala)5-NH2 or a HCO-(l-Ala)11-NH2 peptide with all ϕ
backbone torsion angles set to the same value and all ψ angles
set to the same value. By selecting a large number of geometrically
possible combinations of ϕ and ψ angles, a collection
of regular conformations with the corresponding spectra was created.
Using that database, the experimental ROA patterns of various peptides
adopting a specific secondary structure in solution could be elucidated.10 Interestingly, the database also correctly assigns
the secondary structure of the flexible XAO peptide that has an important
conformational propensity to poly-l-proline type II helix
(PPII), yet is considered to be flexible and explore multiple regions
of the Ramachandran space.10,25 A PPII helix is characterized
by the backbone ϕ and ψ torsion angles clustering around
ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145° in the Ramachandran
plot and is also observed for sequences that do not contain proline.25 It is an important secondary structure element
of both globular proteins and flexible and dynamic IDPs.25 Since our ROA database10 considers only fixed model geometries with a regular arrangement
of backbone torsion angles (the same ϕ and the same ψ
angles for each residue in the backbone), it would conceptually be
less useful to study IDPs compared to well-ordered peptides. Given
the need to further understand the effect of conformational dynamics
and disorder on the ROA spectra of peptides and proteins, we here
extend the database to account for structural disorder. To this end,
using DFT, the ROA spectrum was first computed for a peptide model
with a fixed backbone conformation by setting the ϕ and ψ
angles of all residues in its sequence to the same values across the
backbone. Next, the effect of conformational dynamics and disorderedness
was investigated by increasingly deviating the conformation of this
peptide from the original regular conformation and monitoring its
effect on the computed ROA spectrum. In this study, the effect of
conformational dynamics on the ROA spectra of the left-handed PPII
helix and the right-handed α-helix was studied, since ROA has
been shown to be very sensitive to these types of secondary structure,
yet the detailed understanding of their spectral characteristics is
still lacking.10 Furthermore, these secondary
structure types are of interest to elucidate the experimental ROA
spectra of IDPs.7

Results and Discussion
Intrinsic
Disorder and the PPII Secondary Structure
IDPs are very flexible
proteins, but many of their backbone torsion
angles fluctuate around ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145°,
characteristic for PPII secondary structure.25 ROA gives unique spectral patterns of IDPs that support that these
dynamic proteins do not merely behave like random coils but do contain
residual structure.7,21,26 The most prominent band (∼1320 cm–1) in
the experimental ROA spectra of IDPs is assigned to PPII secondary
structure, although further understanding of the relation between
the spectral patterns and a protein’s structure is lacking.1,21,27 Recently, our group has reported
the experimental ROA spectrum of the XAO peptide that is considered
to primarily adopt PPII helical structure.10,25,28,29 Yet, the XAO
peptide is flexible and its radius of gyration was shown by small-angle
X-ray scattering to be much smaller than that it would be for a fully
extended PPII helix.29 Zhu et al. suggested
that this observation of a low radius of gyration could be reconciled
with the strong evidence from spectroscopic methods pointing to a
major contribution of PPII helical structure in the peptide, by proposing
that flexible stretches of PPII structures are truncated by other
secondary structure elements.21,25 We showed that the
experimental ROA spectrum of the XAO peptide was very well reproduced
by spectra calculated using DFT of poly-l-alanine model structures
with a regular PPII backbone conformation, i.e., with all backbone
torsions set to ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145°.10 This observation hence prompted us to further
study how the spectral patterns would be affected by conformational
dynamics or disorder, as both the XAO peptide and IDPs in general
have a dynamic and flexible structure, although with a propensity
for PPII conformation. To account for the increased flexibility, we
generated sets of structures with ϕ ± σ and ψ
± σ based on chosen values for σ (Scheme 1). Four families of 50 structures
were defined with σ = 6, 10, 20, or 30. The Ramachandran plots
in Figure 1a show the
distribution of the torsion angles going from ϕ = −75°
± σ and ψ = 145° ± σ with a low standard
deviation from the mean angles (σ = 6) to much more conformationally
randomized structures (σ = 30). The Ramachandran plots show
all ϕ and ψ backbone angles of the 50 conformations of
each conformational family. The corresponding molecular geometries
are displayed as superimposed stick figures in Figure 1b. In the Raman and ROA spectra, the largest
variation is observed in the lower-wavenumber region (200–800
cm–1) and the extended amide III region (1240–1345
cm–1), as shown in Figure 1c. Although the individual spectra are distinctly
different, averaging of the spectra over the 50 conformations in each
family leads to mean spectra with similar patterns. In Figure 1d, the Raman and ROA spectra
of HCO-(l-Ala)7-NH2 with all backbone
angles set to ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145° (blue,
σ = 0) are compared to the mean spectra of the four conformational
families (σ = 6, 10, 20, and 30 in red, yellow, purple, and
green, respectively). The Raman spectral patterns are affected only
to a very limited extent by the increasing conformational disorder.
The most apparent changes are the broadening of the lower-wavenumber
region (200–800 cm–1), which leads to the
lowering of the band maxima in that region.

disorder on the Raman and ROA patterns
of PPII secondary structure. The backbone conformation of HCO-(l-Ala)7-NH2 is increasingly randomized
by deviating each ϕ and ψ angle in the backbone from ϕ
= −75° and ψ = 145° to ϕ = −75°
± σ and ψ = 145° ± σ in steps of
σ = 6, 10, 20, 30. (a) Ramachandran plots displaying the increasing

Structure Is Created, in Which All Backbone ϕ and ψ Angles
Are Equal to the Chosen Pair of Angles; (3) Conformational Disorder
Is Introduced by Deviating the Original Pair of Angles More and More
by Using a Different Normally Distributed Random Number στ,ck for Each Torsion Angle
(“randn” in Matlab).
ROA is more sensitive to the increase in conformational
freedom.
Both the low-wavenumber region and the extended amide III region in
the ROA spectra are strongly reduced in intensity with increasing
conformational disorder of the HCO-(l-Ala)7-NH2 model peptide. The ratio of the maximum intensity of the
amide III relative to the amide I region is also reduced as the maximum
intensity of the amide III region drops significantly with increasing
disorder. This suggests that the relative ratio in experimental spectra
of IDPs could be used as an indicator of the dynamics or conformational
freedom of IDPs. For example, both the XAO peptide10 (see above) and the IDP α-synuclein7 in their experimental ROA spectra have a positive amide
III band with a maximum intensity that is higher relative to the amide
I maximum intensity. The ROA spectra in Figure 1 hence suggest that the standard deviation
of the mean torsion angles of XAO and α-synuclein in the PPII
region of the Ramachandran plot does not exceed σ = 20. This
suggests that the ROA patterns of IDPs arise from short sequences
in the protein adopting PPII conformation with torsion angles very
close to ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145°. Our results
support the hypothesis that the XAO peptide adopts PPII helical secondary
structure truncated by other secondary structure elements and furthermore
indicate that the variation of the backbone angles in the PPII region
of the Ramachandran plot is limited.

To further investigate
the effect of mixing different secondary
structure elements, in the following sections, the effect of mixing
PPII secondary structure with right-handed helical structure is evaluated.
Before this mixing can be considered, in the next section, we first
examine how the ROA patterns of α-helical structure on its own
are affected by increasing conformational disorder.

ROA Patterns
of Right-Handed Helical Structure
The
ROA bands that mark α-helical protein structure are well studied
and were assigned years ago.1,30 The most distinctive
patterns are a −/+ couplet centered at ∼1650 cm–1 in the amide I region and a −/+/+ pattern
at ∼1245/1300/1345 cm–1 in the extended amide
III region.1,10 The relative ratios of the amide
III bands of α-helical proteins differ, which therefore has
been suggested to be sensitive to the precise ϕ and ψ
angles. However, the detailed interpretation has been a matter of
debate in the scientific literature. Already in 1999, Blanch et al.
suggested that the positive band around 1345 cm–1 (Cα–H bending vibration parallel to the C–N
bond, coupled with amide III) marks hydrated helical structure, while
the 1300 cm–1 (Cα–H bending vibration
perpendicular to the C–N bond, coupled with amide III) was
proposed to be a signature of α-helical structure without hydration.10,31,32 These assignments were later
questioned and shown to be inaccurate.10 Nevertheless, our group showed that the ratio of the two bands is
very sensitive to the exact helical geometry, which can be affected
by intramolecular hydrogen bonding or interaction with the solvent.10 The database developed in our group showed that
helical structure with the C=O group tilting outward from the
helix axis gives rise to a very intense ROA band around 1300 cm–1, while the band around 1345 cm–1 is a conservative marker of α-helical structure. Since that
database consists of regular conformations with repeated ϕ and
ψ angles, here the influence of conformational dynamics on the
ROA patterns of α-helical structure was investigated. In Figure 2, the spectra of
the HCO-(l-Ala)7-NH2 model peptide
in an α-helical conformation with typical backbone torsion angles
ϕ = −66° and ψ = −41° are shown
and how the Raman and ROA patterns are affected when these specific
torsion angles are increasingly randomized. As shown in Figure 2a,b, with high standard deviations
σ of the mean ϕ and ψ angles, the regular α-helical
structure is very much randomized from the regular conformation. Because
of that, both the Raman and ROA spectra of the individual conformations
in each family are strongly affected, as shown in the superimposed
spectra in Figure 2c. It is therefore a striking result that the mean spectra of each
family of conformations are so similar (see Figure 2d). The largest spectral differences in the
mean spectra are observed in the lower-wavenumber region that drops
significantly in maximal intensities and in the amide I region, which
loses the negative portion of the characteristic −/+ couplet.
As we showed before that the amide III region is very sensitive to
the exact α-helical conformation,10 it is a remarkable result that the mean patterns here are so similar.
While the individual spectra shown in Figure 2c show a lot of variation in that region,
the mean spectra show the same relative intensities of the −/+/+
pattern.

Figure 2 Effect of conformational disorder on the ROA patterns of α-helical
secondary structure. The backbone conformation of HCO-(l-Ala)7-NH2 is increasingly randomized by deviating each
ϕ and ψ angle in the backbone from ϕ = −66°
and ψ = −41° to ϕ = −66° ±
σ and ψ = −41° ± σ. (a) Ramachandran
plots displaying the increasing deviation from the central ϕ

family of 50 structures with a set standard deviation σ. (b)

family. (c) Individual Raman (IR + IL) and ROA (IR – IL) spectra of each family of 50 conformations.
(d) Mean Raman and ROA spectra of the four families (σ = 6 (red),
10 (yellow), 20 (purple), and 30 (green)) compared to the computed
spectrum of HCO-(l-Ala)7-NH2 with all
backbone angles set to ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145°
(blue; σ = 0).

ROA Is Sensitive to the Mean α-Helical Conformation
As our previous work showed that ROA is very sensitive to the exact
α-helical conformation,10 the results
shown in Figure 2 were
extended to other α-helical conformations (specific pairs of
ϕ and ψ angles) to study the effect of conformational
disorder in more detail. Similar to the results discussed above, first,
the ROA spectra of regular HCO-Ala7-NH2 model
conformations with all ϕ and ψ backbone angles equal were
computed. The computed Raman and ROA spectra are shown in Figure 3 by the blue lines
and thus correspond to a Raman and an ROA spectrum of a single conformation.
By looking at five different pairs of ϕ and ψ angles,
the effect of slight differences in the α-helical conformation
is evaluated. These results are also compared to a 310-helical
conformation (ϕ = −71° and ψ = −18°)
to confirm the structural sensitivity of ROA to different types of
helix. The red, yellow, purple, and green lines correspond to the
average spectra of families of 50 structures with the standard deviation
σ of the mean ϕ and ψ backbone angles being σ
= 6, 10, 20, and 30, respectively (see Figures S1–S5 for the spectra of the individual conformations).

Figure 3 Effect
of conformational disorder on the ROA patterns of right-handed
helical secondary structure. For six couples of ϕ and ψ
angles, the conformation of HCO-(l-Ala)7-NH2 was increasingly randomized by deviating each ϕ and
ψ angle in the backbone from the initial ϕ and ψ
to ϕ ± σ and ψ ± σ in families of
50 conformations with respective standard deviation σ (see Scheme 1). Mean Raman (IR + IL) and ROA
(IR – IL) spectra of HCO-Ala7-NH2 with backbone torsion
angles set to various values corresponding to α-helical secondary
structure or 310-helix (σ = 0; blue) and the deviation
from that with torsion angles with a standard deviation from these
angles set to σ = 6 (red), 10 (yellow), 20 (purple), and 30
(green). The red, yellow, purple, and green spectra correspond to
the average of 50 spectra of the family of 50 model structures with
randomly generated normal distributed torsion angles.

The mean Raman spectra in Figure 3 mostly show broadening of the spectral patterns
with
increasing conformational disorder (higher σ) from the original
regular helix conformation (blue; σ = 0). The spectral differences
in the mean ROA spectra are similar to those observed in Figure 2. Also for the other
α-helical conformations, the amide I region in the ROA spectra
in Figure 3 does not
show the negative contribution of the couplet upon increasing conformational
disorder. Since for α-helical proteins and peptides the amide
I is always observed as a −/+ couplet, this indicates that
this spectral pattern arises from regular helical structure with a
limited variation of the backbone ϕ and ψ angles.

In accordance with our previous analysis,10 the spectra of the α-helical models with slightly different
mean backbone angles show markedly different amide III patterns. We
showed that the ratio of the maximal intensity of the positive amide
III bands depends on the ϕ and ψ angles in the backbone
of regular α-helical model conformations. For α-helical
conformations defined by torsion angles in the bottom right of the
α-helical region in the Ramachandran plot to the top right in
that same region, the intensity of the ROA band around 1300 cm–1 relative to the band around 1345 cm–1 increases. The band around 1345 cm–1 was shown
to be a conservative marker of α-helical structure. This is
also observed in Figure 3, by comparing the ROA spectra of the same color. For example, the
blue spectra of the top three panels show a much higher positive maximum
intensity around 1345 cm–1, relative to the 1300
cm–1 band, compared to the ratio in the panels below.

The effect of increasingly deviating the conformation from the
regular conformation (all ϕ angles and all ψ angles equal,
see Scheme 1) can be
seen by comparing the ROA spectra within the same panel from σ
= 0 (blue) to σ = 30 (green). Very surprisingly, the amide III
region of the α-helical models is robust with the increase in
variation of the backbone conformation; in other words, the −/+/+
pattern and relative ratios remain generally the same for each combination
of ϕ and ψ angles. This shows that the amide III region
of α-helical proteins is a pattern resulting from the average
helix conformation in the structural ensemble. In agreement with our
previous results, the positive band around 1345 cm–1 is a robust marker of α-helical structure; it is found in
all calculated spectra of α-helical structure, even if the helix
is considerably random (see spectra for σ = 20 or 30). The positive
band around 1300 cm–1 is very sensitive to the combination
of ϕ and ψ angles and has a very low (even negative) value
for structures with backbone angles in the bottom right of the α-helical
region of the Ramachandran plot and gradually increases for structures
with backbone angles toward the top left of the α-helical region
(see Figure 3 and ref (10)).

These observations
are further supported by analyzing the ratio
of the maximum intensity of the two positive bands at 1300 and 1345
cm–1 in the amide III region in Figure 4. In agreement with our earlier
results, the ratio is very sensitive to the exact combination of the
ϕ and ψ angles, observing very high ratios for structures
with backbone angles in the top left of the helical region in the
Ramachandran plot, to much lower ratios in the bottom right. Both
for the α-helical model with torsion angles set ϕ = −77°
and ψ = −34° and the 310-model with ϕ
= −71° and ψ = −18°, the positive band
around 1300 cm–1 has a very high intensity that
collapses with increasing conformational freedom.

Figure 4 (Left) Ratio of the maximum
intensity of the two positive bands
in the extended amide III region of the mean ROA spectra at 1300/1345
cm–1. (Right) Ramachandran plot showing the (ϕ;
ψ) pairs of angles used in this study: (−75; 145°),
(−51; −53°), (−59; −44°), (−64;
−41°), (−66; −41°), (−77; −34°),
(−71; −18°). The contour lines mark different secondary
structure regions based on the hydrogen bonding in regular model alanine
heptapeptides (see ref (10)).

Only with a very high degree of
conformational dynamics or disorder
(σ = 30), all helical models, including the 310-conformation,
obtain a similar ROA pattern (Figure 3) and intensity ratio (Figure 4). To conclude the above results, the intensity
ratio of the two bands is sensitive to the average helical conformation.

Effect of Mixing PPII with Other Secondary Structures on the
ROA Patterns
As discussed above, IDPs adopt a substantial
amount of PPII in their structural ensembles. The results discussed
above furthermore showed that the experimental ROA patterns do not
agree with very flexible chains with average torsion angles around
PPII angles (ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145°).
More likely, short stretches of PPII with average angles close to
ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145° but truncated by
other secondary structure elements fit better with experiment.21

To further study the ROA patterns associated
with IDPs, here the effect of PPII mixing with other secondary structure
components is therefore explored. First, the behavior in solution
of IDPs is considered. The protein α-synuclein, for example,
has attracted extensive scientific interest due to its central role
in Parkinson’s disease and related neurodegenerative diseases
(termed synucleinopathies).7,33,34 Our group reported the experimental ROA patterns of α-synculein
adopting different conformations, yet the origin of the spectral patterns
of IDPs and small differences in their ROA spectra are unknown.7 To describe the flexible structure of IDPs, multiple
structural ensembles have been proposed based on NMR approaches. In Figure 5, the Ramachandran
plots of three of such structural ensembles of α-synculein are
shown. All three display distinct conformational preferences.

Figure 5 Ramachandran
plots of the α-synuclein ensembles by Allison
et al. (left), Tóth et al. (middle), and Schwalbe et al. (right).33−35

Due to the differences in the
methodology of these three studies,
the Ramachandran plots of the ensembles are quite different. Yet,
all three graphs show that most backbone torsion angles fluctuate
in the PPII region, with the right-handed helical region also populated.
The ensemble by Tóth et al. (middle) furthermore shows an important
contribution of the β-strand region. On the basis of these graphs,
the mixing of PPII structure with either helical or β-strand
structure is explored here. To this end, the Raman and ROA spectra
of HCO-Ala7-NH2 model peptides that differ in
the ratios of PPII/helix and PPII/β-strand were computed. As
before, families of 50 structures were created by defining the backbone
torsion angles. To include conformational freedom in these families
of structures, a standard deviation of the mean backbone angles of
σ = 20 was used. Next, ensembles of 50 structures with different
specified ratios of PPII/helix or PPII/β-strand were generated
as visualized in the Ramachandran plots in Figures 6 and 7. To vary the
ratio of the two secondary structures, we used a similar approach
to that described in Scheme 1, by adding an additional step to randomly assign each residue
to one of the two secondary structures, as described in more detail
in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 6 Mixing
of PPII with right-handed helical structure: Ramachandran
plots of the backbone angles of each family of 50 DFT optimized structures
with a specific ratio of PPII/helix. For PPII, (−75; 145°)
was used as the central pair of angles, and for the helical structures,
(−71; −18°) (see Ramachandran plot for the ensemble
by Schwalbe et al. in Figure 5). On the right-hand side, the ROA (IR – IL) spectra are shown
as the average of 50 spectra of the 50 structures.

Figure 7 Mixing of PPII with β-strand structure: Ramachandran
plots
of the backbone angles of each family of 50 DFT optimized conformations
with a specific ratio of PPII/helix. For PPII, (−75; 145°)
was used as the central angles, and for the β-strand, (−125;
150°) (see Ramachandran plot for the Tóth ensemble in Figure 5). On the right-hand
side, the ROA (IR – IL) spectra are shown as the average of 50 spectra of the
50 corresponding structures.

In Figure 6, the
average ROA spectra of the different conformational families of PPII/helix
are shown (the corresponding Raman spectra are shown in Figure S6). The amide I band in both the Raman
and ROA spectra shifts down about 15 cm–1 going
from 100% PPII to 100% right-handed helix because of the presence
of C=O···H–N hydrogen bonds in the helical
structures. The broad amide III band around 1230–1240 cm–1 in the Raman spectra gradually decreases in intensity,
marking the reduction in PPII content while the positive bands around
1300 and 1345 cm–1 increase, both arising from Cα–H
bending modes coupled to amide III vibrational motions in the helical
structure.

In the ROA spectra, the change in the extended amide
III region
is more visible with the positive band at 1318 cm–1 (100% PPII) becoming broader upon increasing the helical content,
with eventually the appearance of the characteristic two positive
bands marking α-helical structure around 1300 and 1345 cm–1 (100% helix). Two important conclusions can be drawn
from this graph. First, the broad asymmetric band in the amide III
region in the ROA spectra with mixed PPII/helix suggests that the
extended amide III region in experimental ROA spectra of IDPs arises
from PPII segments mixed with other structural elements such as helical
structure. Second, the appearance of the two positive ROA bands marking
α-helical structure at 1300 and 1345 cm–1 only
for a content of 80–100% helix again shows that ROA is sensitive
to rigid secondary structure elements in solution. As experimental
ROA spectra of proteins in solution with much less helical content
than 80% already show the two positive bands, these bands must arise
from sequences of multiple residues adopting a right-handed helix.
Since here a helix with 310-backbone angles was considered,
the unfolding of an α-helix to PPII structure was calculated
to further study the mixing of secondary structures.

As the
Ramachandran plot of the ensemble of α-synculein by
Tóth et al. shows an important population of the β-strand
region (Figure 5),
the effect of the mixing of PPII with β-strand structure on
the ROA patterns was also probed here. Similar to the previous calculations,
multiple families of 50 structures with different ratios of PPII/β-strand
were generated (see the Ramachandran plot in Figure 7). As can be seen in the computed spectra
of these conformational families, the amide I region is not much shifted
upon variation of the PPII/β-strand ratio (the corresponding
Raman spectra are shown in Figure S7).
However, as can be seen in Figure 7, the ROA amide I does change shape quite distinctly,
with a negative band emerging upon increasing the β-strand content.
This spectral change hence arises from the change in the orientation
of the C=O groups and not from hydrogen bonding.

The
extended amide III region is quite sensitive to the mixing
of PPII/β-strand in both the Raman and ROA spectra. A positive
amide III band appears around 1240 cm–1 in the ROA
spectra upon increasing the β-strand content, as well as a broad
negative band in the region 1345–1370 cm–1. The experimental ROA spectrum of, e.g., poly-l-lysine,
in β-sheet state displays a broad positive band around 1260
cm–1 and a negative band at 1351 cm–1.36 Such a negative band is often observed
in the experimental ROA spectra of proteins with a large β-sheet
content.36 While for the mixing of PPII
with helical structure the skeletal stretch region changed from a
typical PPII −/+/+ signature (860–980 cm–1) to a positive band (930 cm–1) with high helical
content, this spectral pattern −/+/+ (860–980 cm–1) upon mixing PPII with β-strand structure remains
the same.

To conclude, the spectral features that appear in
the ROA spectra
in Figure 7 upon increasing
the β-strand content do not reflect spectral patterns observed
experimentally for IDPs. The ROA spectra of mixing PPII backbone torsion
angles with helical backbone torsion angles is on the other hand reminiscent
of the experimental ROA spectral patterns observed for IDPs. Finally,
to further study the mixing of PPII with helical secondary structure,
in the next section, the unfolding of an α-helix to a PPII backbone
is studied.

α-Helix Unfolding to PPII
Above, the transition
of helical structure to PPII secondary structure was probed by varying
all backbone torsion angles of a peptide model simultaneously and
calculating the Raman and ROA spectra at set percentages of the two
secondary structures (two pairs of ϕ and ψ angles). In
this section, the change in the spectra is considered when one regular
α-helical model peptide makes a gradual transition to PPII extended
helix by changing the backbone angles of each residue one by one starting
from the N-terminus. By doing this for a HCO-(l-Ala)11-NH2 peptide, the difference with the results
described above is that multiple consecutive residues of both secondary
structure types coexist within the same peptide.

As shown in Figure 8, upon varying the
structure from 100% PPII to 100% α-helix, the largest changes
in the Raman spectra appear in the 500–550 cm–1 region (backbone deformations and out-of-plane N–H bending),
the extended amide III region, and the amide I region. The ROA spectra
show considerable changes across the entire spectral window. Amide
I in the ROA spectra changes from a positive band associated with
PPII structure to a −/+ couplet marking α-helical structure.
The most interesting spectral region appears to be the amide III region
that retains a strong positive band around 1300–1325 cm–1, while only for the spectrum consisting of 100% α-helical
backbone, the two positive amide III bands are clearly distinguishable.

(IR + IL)
and ROA (IR + IL) spectra of the gradual change of a PPII backbone conformation
to an α-helix starting from the N-terminus. Each spectrum is
calculated for a HCO-Ala11-NH2 model peptide.
From (A) to (F), each time the next two consecutive (ϕ; ψ)
angles are changed from PPII (−75; 145°) to α-helical
(−64; −41°): (A) residues 1–11 PPII, (B)
residues 1–2 α-helical, (C) 1–4 α-helical,
(D) 1–6 α -helical, (E) 1–8 α-helical, and
(F) 1–10 α-helical.

In Figure 9, the
amide III spectral region is shown in more detail. There are different
contributions to the extended amide III region. The vibrational modes
in this spectral region arise from the coupling of C–N stretching
with Cα–H and N–H bending.32 The coupling of the latter two bending modes is very sensitive
to the exact geometry and is considered one of the most important
regions in the ROA spectrum due to the intense bands ca. 1230–1350
cm–1.1 In Figure 9, with higher α-helical
content in the model peptide, a negative amide III band appears below
1300 cm–1. Furthermore, four positive bands are
observed in the Cα–H bending mode region (1300–1370
cm–1). PPII structure has a prominent positive band
at 1308 cm–1 that diminishes with increasing α-helical
content. The shoulder around 1323 cm–1 becomes more
evident for the mixed PPII/α-helical structures. Only for the
fully α-helical model structure, the ROA band marking α-helical
structure at 1343 cm–1 is separately observed without
the band around 1323 cm–1. The band around 1323
cm–1 has two important contributions: (1) amide
III modes in the backbone and (2) an amide III mode of the C-terminus.
The latter mode, arising from the capping of the peptide model, possibly
explains the intense appearance of the band in the amide III region
of the mixed PPII/α-helix structures. A fourth Cα–H
bending mode band is observed around 1370 cm–1 for
the structures with a high PPII content.

Figure 9 Raman (IR + IL) and ROA (IR – IL) spectra in
the extended amide III region
of HCO-(l-Ala)11-NH2 in an α-helical
conformation (red) that was unfolded to a PPII backbone conformation
starting from the N-terminus to an α-helix (red). Ranging from
the red to the black lines, one pair of consecutive (ϕ; ψ)
angles for each consecutive spectrum changed from (−75; 145°)
to (−64; −41°).

A few conclusions can be drawn from Figure 9. First, the amide III band around 1340–1345
cm–1 is the most reliable marker for α-helical
structure. Even for a minor contribution of ϕ and ψ α-helical
angles, this band is observed. It mainly arises from Cα–H
bending with its motion parallel to the Cα–N bond. The
diminishing of this ROA band around 1345 cm–1 is
reminiscent of the gradual disappearing of that band in the experimental
ROA spectra of thermally unfolding α-lactalbumin.37,38 On the other hand, here, a positive intensity of around 1300–1310
cm–1 in the ROA spectrum is observed for both the
α-helical and PPII secondary structures, and should hence be
carefully assigned. Furthermore, the region 1200–1300 cm–1 has an important contribution from C–N stretching,
which is very dependent on hydrogen bonding, e.g., with water.39 For structures with a large content of PPII
structure, intense Raman bands are observed in that region in Figure 9. However, PPII structure
is not stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds such as in the
case of α-helical structure, rather the carbonyl groups pointing
outward from the backbone allow hydrogen bonding with water.25 This urges the need to study the effect of explicit
hydration on the ROA patterns in more detail, specifically in the
case of PPII structure. Also the negative ROA band around 1280 cm–1 appears upon hydrogen bond formation in the α-helical
segment of the model peptide. Experimentally, the ROA spectra of IDPs
show a negative band in this region. On the basis of the calculations
in this study, there are no indications for this negative band arising
from PPII secondary structure, which is the main structural element
of IDPs. The calculated spectra in this study, however, show that
it could arise from helical contributions.

Conclusions
This
study of the effect of conformational dynamics and structural
disorder showed that ROA patterns mainly reflect the average distribution
of the backbone conformation. Therefore, the approach to elucidate
experimental ROA spectra based on a large database of calculated spectra
of fixed model structures reported before by our group is a good simple
methodology to study the amide modes.10 Only upon larger variation of the backbone angles of common secondary
structure elements such as PPII and right-handed helical structure,
the ROA patterns average.

This study furthermore supports the
view that experimental ROA
patterns likely stem from the most rigid components in the structural
ensemble. For example, in the case of IDPs, a strong positive band
∼1318 cm–1 in the amide III reflects PPII
secondary structure with backbone angles close (variation of the mean
angles σ ≤ 20°) to the average PPII backbone angles
(ϕ = −75° and ψ = 145°), rather than
a fully flexible structure with the mean backbone angles being ϕ
= −75° and ψ = 145°. Furthermore, the mixing
of PPII with other secondary structure elements may explain the experimentally
observed ROA patterns. Mixing of PPII structure with right-handed
helical structure is more alike experimental ROA patterns than mixing
with β-strand structure. Furthermore, it was shown that ROA
is extremely sensitive to the exact conformation of α-helical
structure and the tilt of the carbonyl groups in the C=O···H–N
hydrogen bonds, which could be affected by explicit hydrogen bonding
with water.10 Also the CH and CH2 groups in amino acid side chains could have a pronounced effect
on, e.g., the amide III region through coupling of the vibrational
modes of these groups with Cα–H and N–H bending
modes, which will hence be the focus of our future research.

Methodology
ROA signals of proteins mainly arise from the amide and skeletal
stretching vibrations in the backbone; therefore, poly-l-alanine
peptides are often used in computational ROA studies, since this is
the smallest chiral amino acid and conformational averaging of the
side chains does not need to be considered.10 In this study, model peptide structures of the general formula HCO-(l-Ala)7-NH2 were created using the Python
peptide builder by Tien et al. that generates the models based on
a set of ϕ and ψ torsion angles.40 First, different secondary structure element models were created
by selecting specific pairs of torsion angles (step 1 in Scheme 1) and setting all
backbone ϕ and ψ angles to this pair for each residue
in the peptide (step 2 in Scheme 1). In that way, “regular” conformations
are generated. To include conformational dynamics, the model ϕ
and ψ angles were varied to different extents from the initial
angles (step 3 in Scheme 1). To this end, the torsion angles of each residue were generated
using the “randn” function in Matlab R2017a (Mathworks,
Inc.) that renders normally distributed pseudorandom numbers with
standard deviation 1 (see curve in Scheme 1). By increasing the standard deviation of
these random numbers, the generated ϕ and ψ angles deviate
more and more from the initial chosen angles, and hence more and more
conformational variation is imposed on the model peptide. In this
way, families of 50 randomly generated conformations were constructed,
where for each family, a different degree of conformational freedom
was imposed by multiplying the chosen standard deviation σ of
the torsion angles 6, 10, 20, or 30° with a normally distributed
random number (step 3 in Scheme 1). So, for each backbone angle of each conformation,
a new random number was generated.

Next, the geometry of each
conformation of the model peptide was
partially optimized using the normal mode optimization procedure.41 By locking the normal modes between i300 cm–1 (imaginary) and 300 cm–1 in the
optimization, the backbone conformation is retained, while the modes
of spectroscopic interest are fully relaxed.41 These geometry optimizations were performed using the B3PW91 DFT
functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Subsequently, the Hessian
matrix and Raman and ROA tensors were calculated using the same functional
and the 6-31++G(d,p) basis set. The experimental backscattered Raman
(IR + IL)
and ROA (IR – IL) spectral shapes were simulated by using a Lorentzian
function for each normal mode with a full width at half-height of
20 cm–1 to mimic the physical line broadening in
the experimental spectra. A Boltzmann intensity correction factor
was applied for a temperature of 300 K (see, e.g., Cheeseman et al.).42 Solvent–solute interactions with water
were taken into account using the conductor-like polarizable continuum
model with the default solvent parameters in the program Gaussian.
For all DFT calculations, the Gaussian 16 (rev A.03) program was used.43 For the sake of comparison with experimental
data in the scientific literature, the calculated spectra are scaled
in the wavenumber dimension by using a global scaling factor of 0.987.10 Images of molecular structures were created
using Jmol-12.2.32 or CylView v1.0 β, and figures were produced
using Matlab R2017a.44,45 The Ramachandran plots were prepared
with “scatplot” in Matlab.
