An activity-guided
fractionation approach revealed several phenylpropanoid
glycerol glucosides isolated from the bulbs of Lilium
longiflorum Thunb. (Easter lily) with gluconeogenesis
inhibitory activities. The strongest activity was observed for (2S)-1-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosylglycerol (3), (2S)-1-O-caffeoyl-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosylglycerol (1), and (2R)-1-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-2-O-p-coumaroylglycerol (2) with inhibitions of 51.2, 39.2, and 36.8%, respectively. The p-coumaroyl-based (3) and its acetylated derivative
(5) exhibited differential inhibition activity (51.2%
as compared to 3.6%), suggesting that natural acetylation decreases
the hypoglycemic activity of these compounds. Direct structure–activity
analysis of phenylpropanoid glycerol glucosides indicated that the
hydroxylation pattern of the hydroxy cinnamic acid moiety and acetylation
were responsible for the differences in activity. This is the first
report of phenylpropanoid glycerol glucosides as a phytochemical class
of hepatic glucose production inhibitors.

Introduction
Type II diabetes is
one of the leading causes of death in the United
States.1 According to recent estimates,
over 30 million Americans have diabetes and 84 million are estimated
to be prediabetic. In 2014, the World Health Organization estimated
that 422 million adults worldwide had diabetes.2 The global prevalence of diabetes has been steadily rising,
and in the United States the disease is forecast to affect more than
54.9 million Americans by 2030, resulting in an economic burden exceeding
$622 billion.3 To counter the increasing
incidence of type II diabetes, effective and targeted treatments are
needed.

Targeting the prediabetic stages of type II diabetes
offers an
attractive approach to confront this global epidemic. In healthy people,
insulin is produced by the pancreas, eliciting a commensurate decrease
in glucose production in the liver to maintain blood glucose homeostasis.
In diabetics, this process is disrupted, causing a chronic hyperglycemic state resulting in vascular dysfunction
and organ-specific damage.4 Preceding the
development of type II diabetes, a metabolic syndrome characterized
by increased hepatic gluconeogenesis is frequently observed.5 The liver is the main producer of glucose that
is released into circulation through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
Postprandial insulin directly inhibits glycogenolysis and increases
glycogen synthesis by modulating the activities of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase and glucose 6-phosphatase, two key enzymes that regulate
pyruvate metabolism and glucose secretion.4 Identifying new therapies targeting these pathways offers an approach
to delay, or potentially prevent, the onset of type II diabetes.

Well known agents successfully targeting hepatic gluconeogenesis,
such as metformin, the most widely prescribed type II diabetes drug,
have motivated significant interest in identifying new hepatic glucose
inhibitors.6 Other drugs, such as glucokinase
activators, which treat the prediabetic stages, have had inconsistent
success.7 Natural products offer promise
as potential hepatic gluconeogenesis inhibitors because their structural
diversity is often the basis for their specific pharmacological activity.
Accordingly, natural products may well contribute to a pipeline for
the discovery of new small-molecule-based treatments.8

Food-derived natural products offer a wealth of compounds
that
could be effective hepatic gluconeogenesis inhibitors. In a contemporary
study, polyphenols from a green tea extract were shown to suppress
hepatic glucose enzyme production.5 In
another recent work, chlorogenic acids extracted from chicory were
also shown to suppress hepatic glucose production.9 The bulbs of the Easter lily, Lilium longiflorum Thunb., are widely used in Asian cooking and in traditional medicinal
treatments. In China and Japan, the bulbs are added to culinary dishes
and are also prescribed to treat inflammation, suppress coughing fits,
and induce wound healing.10,11 Studies have identified
a variety of steroidal glycosides and polyphenols within the Lilium genus, which may be the basis for their broad use
in traditional medicine applications.12 In a previous study, crude bulb extracts of Easter lily were effective
in improving glucose metabolism in oral glucose tolerance tests performed
on type II diabetic murine models, although the compounds responsible
for the activity were not identified.13 Moreover, some extracts prepared from Easter lily bulbs provided
hepatoprotective activity, lowering blood glucose levels in murine
models with impaired glucose tolerance and improving liver function
in type II diabetic mice. These results indicate steroidal glycosides
present in the extracts played a role in the observed hepatoprotective
effects; however, the compounds responsible for the hypocholesterolemic
and hypoglycemic effects have yet to be identified.13

The studies conducted in this report were designed
to identify
and evaluate other natural products in Easter lily having the potential
to delay the onset of metabolic syndrome by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis.
Here, this work reports the antigluconeogenic properties of Easter
lily bulb extracts by employing an activity-guided fractionation approach
modeled on a cellular hepatic glucose assay to examine the inhibitory
activity of the fractionated extracts. The objectives were to: (1)
isolate compounds from the bulb extracts and identify structures through
a combination of preparative chromatography, liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS), and NMR; (2) determine the antigluconeogenic
activity of the pure compounds; and (3) further investigate this activity
by examining their structure–activity relationship.

Materials
and Methods
Plant Material
L. longiflorum (cultivar 7-4) bulbs were cultivated following the methods reported
in Munafo et al. 2010.14 Mature L. longiflorum bulbs (∼60 bulbs) were harvested,
separated, and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to being lyophilized
with a Virtis advantage freeze dryer (SP Industries, Warminster, PA)
and stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis.

Chemicals
All solvents, acetonitrile, 1-butanol, dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), ethyl acetate, ethanol, formic acid, methanol, pentanes, and
tetrahydrofuran were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.
(Fairlawn, NJ). Methanol-d4 (0.3% v/v
TMS) was sourced from Millipore-Sigma (St. Louis, MO). A purification
system (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was employed to obtain deionized (DI)
water (18 MΩ cm), in-house.

Isolation and Identification
of Compounds
Sequential Solvent Extraction of Lyophilized L. longiflorum Bulbs
Lyophilized lily bulbs
(100 g) were ground to a fine powder using a standard laboratory mill
(IKA Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany), after which the bulbs were extracted
with pentanes (3 × 100 mL) while being shaken on a wrist action
shaker (Burrell Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) for 30 min at room temperature.
The solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 710 G on a Sorvall RC-3C
Plus centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ). Next, the
materials were combined and evaporated under reduced pressure (1.0 ×
10–3 bar) at 30 °C with a Laborota 4003 rotary
evaporator (Heidolph Brinkman LLC, Elk Grove Village, IL), resulting
in Fraction I. The pellet was placed in the fume hood overnight to
remove excess solvent, and the resulting dried residue was mixed with
ethanol and deionized water (70:30, v/v; 2 × 150 mL) on an autoshaker
for 45 min. Then, the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 710 G,
followed by vacuum filtration with Whatman 114 qualitative filter
paper (Whatman International, Maidstone, U.K.). The supernatant was
then removed and evaporated under reduced pressure to be lyophilized
twice, resulting in Fraction II. After which the additional powder
(12.7 g) was combined with deionized water (100 mL), the solution
extracted with ethyl acetate (5 × 100 mL), and the organic phases
combined. These were placed under reduced pressure to be evaporated,
dissolved in deionized water (25 mL), and lyophilized twice, producing
Fraction III. After that, using 1-butanol, the aqueous phase was extracted
(5 × 100 mL), followed by evaporation under reduced pressure
and two lyophilizations, leading to Fraction IV. For the final fraction,
the aqueous phase was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue
was dissolved in deionized water (25 mL) prior to two rounds of lyophilization,
producing Fraction V (Figure 1). The yields from each fraction were as follows: I (0.57
g), II (13.7 g), III (0.77 g), IV (8.96 g), and V (2.42 g). All fractions
were stored at −80 °C for later use in fractionation,
bioassay, and chemical analysis.

Subfractionation of Fraction
III
Fraction III showed
significant activity in hepatic cellular assays and was further investigated.
The above procedure was repeated multiple times to produce enough
of Fraction III for further fractionation. Fraction III (5.0 g) was
dissolved in deionized water (275 mL), the solution extracted with
ethyl acetate (2 × 200 mL), the organic phases combined and evaporated
under reduced pressure, then dissolved in deionized water (25 mL),
and lyophilized twice, producing Fraction III-1 (0.6 g). The remaining
aqueous phase was extracted with 1-butanol (2 × 200 mL), evaporated
under reduced pressure, and twice lyophilized, producing Fraction
III-2 (3.8 g). Lastly, the aqueous phase was evaporated under reduced
pressure, and the residue was dissolved in DI water (25 mL), and lyophilized
twice, yielding Fraction III-3 (0.3 g) (Figure 2).

Preparative Reverse-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
(RP-HPLC)
Implementing a modified procedure reported in Munafo
et al. 2015, compounds 1–9 were purified to homogeneity
from the pooled subfractions III-1 and III-2 (III-1/2).12 Fraction (III-1/2) was fractionated by semipreparative
RP-HPLC on a 10 μm Luna C18 column (250 mm × 21.2 mm i.d.)
(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). This was done using an LC-6AD liquid chromatograph
(Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Columbia, MD) connected to
a UV−vis detector and a 2 mL injection loop. The mobile phases
were (A) 0.1% formic acid in DI water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in
acetonitrile. The flow rate was set to 20 mL/min, the column temperature
was 23 ± 2 °C, and UV detection was recorded at 210 nm.
Fraction (III-1/2) (100 mg) was dissolved in a mixture of mobile phase
A and mobile phase B (90:10, v/v; 2 mL) and filtered through a 0.45
μm PTFE syringe filter prior to injection (injection volume;
1 mL). The extract was fractionated using a linear gradient of 5–24.4%
B for 35 min and then ramped to 90% B over 5 min, with a hold at 90%
B for an additional 5 min. The solvent mixture was reset to 5% B for
10 min before subsequent injections. Fractions containing the compounds
of interest were collected, and the separation was repeated. After
multiple purifications, the fractions were analyzed by LC–MS
and individually pooled. The solvent was evaporated under reduced
pressure (30 °C; 1.0 × 10–3 bar) and lyophilized,
yielding 1 (5.2 mg), 2 (2.1 mg), 3 (29.6 mg), 4 (5.2 mg), 5 (30.3 mg), 6 (5.7 mg), 7 (5.4 mg), 8 (7.2 mg),
and 9 (6.9 mg) as yellow amorphous powders with >98%
purity as determined by LC–MS and NMR.

Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS)
LC–MS analyses were performed with an Agilent 1260 series
HPLC system interfaced to a 6410 triple-quadrupole LC–MS mass-selective
detector with an API-ESI ionization source (Agilent Technologies Inc.,
Santa Clara, CA). The system was equipped with an autosampler, a BIN
Pump SL binary pump, a TCC SL thermostated column compartment, and
a DAD-SL diode array detector. Chromatographic separations were made
on a 5 μm Prodigy C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.) (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, the column temperature
was set to 23 ± 2 °C, and an injection volume was of 10
μL. The binary mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.1% formic acid
in DI water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Separations
were affected using a linear gradient of 15–34.6% B for 28
min and, then, ramped to 95% B over 5 min with a hold at 95% B for
5 min. The system was reset to 15% B for 10 min before each sample
injection. The column temperature was set at 25 °C and operated
at a 1.0 mL/min flow rate. All samples were dissolved in a mixture
of mobile phase A and mobile phase B (90:10, v/v) and filtered through
a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter prior to injection (injection
volume 10 μL). Data acquisition and analysis were performed
using Mass Hunter Workstation Data Acquisition, Qualitative Analysis,
and Quantitative Analysis software. LC–MS analysis was performed
in both negative- and positive-ion modes with ionization parameters
set at capillary voltage, 3.5 kV; nebulizer pressure, 35 psi; drying
gas flow, 13.0 mL/min; drying gas temperature, 350 °C; and mass
scan range, m/z 100–2000.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR)
1D 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were acquired on an AMX-400
spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). 2D heteronuclear multiple-bond
correlation, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence, and H–H
correlation spectroscopy (H–H COSY) spectra were acquired on
a 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). Samples for
NMR analysis were dissolved in methanol-d4, and chemical shifts were calculated as δ values with reference
to tetramethylsilane (TMS).

Cell Culture
To
determine the efficacy of these compounds
as gluconeogenesis inhibitors, the rat hepatoma cell line H4IIE (CRL-1600)
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) was examined because these cells maintain physiological
regulation of gluconeogenesis in vitro in response to hormones. Cell
passage was performed every 3–4 days, and cells were cultured
in a high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (Life Science Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with
1% penicillin–streptomycin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA)
at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Next, cells were subcultured
in 24-well plates and, once confluence was reached, were cultured
on an induction medium consisting of glucose-free DMEM supplemented
with 20 mM sodium lactate and 2 mM sodium pyruvate. To induce gluconeogenesis,
cells were treated with 0.5 μL of dexamethasone and 10 mM 8-CTP-cAMP
(Dex-cAMP). After 8 h, 10 nM insulin was applied to suppress glucose
production.

In Vitro Assay for Glucose Production Inhibition
The
production of glucose was measured by sampling 50 μL of cell
culture medium from the vehicle (negative control, 0.1% DMSO), the
glucose-inducing control (Dex-cAMP)(DC), positive control (Dex-cAMP
with 10 nM insulin)(Ins), and treatment levels (Dex-cAMP with 50 μg/mL
fractions or 10 μM of a single compound 1–9). The conversion of glucose to gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide
was measured at an absorption of 530 nm and an emission of 590 nm
following the instructions of the Amplex red glucose/glucose oxidase
kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) on a fluorescence microplate
reader (BioTek Synergy HA, Sunnyvale, CA). All cellular results are
expressed as the percent of the induced control.

Statistical
Analysis
To establish the activity of fractions,
subfractions, and pure compounds in the examined cell line, a one-way
analysis of variance followed by a Tukey HSD (α = 0.05) was
conducted on JMP Pro 14 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The data was
presented as mean ± SEM. P-values of <0.05
were considered statistically significant.

Results and Discussion
Activity-Guided
Fractionation and Suppression of Cellular Glucose
Production
Sequential solvent extracts (Fr. I–V) of
lyophilized L. longiflorum bulbs were
examined for their suppression of glucose production in the H4IIE
rat hepatoma cell line. The negative control (Dex-cAMP) was considered
the maximum glucose production at 100%, while the positive control
(Dex-cAMP + insulin 10 μm) showed only 20% glucose production
in comparison. The bulb fractions (I–V) were tested at a concentration
of 50 μg/mL with Fr. III glucose production suppressed by 25%
(p < 0.05) (Figure 3). The remaining fractions (I, II, IV, and V) did not
show significant gluconeogenesis suppression relative to the control.
Fraction III was further separated by liquid–liquid solvent
partitioning. Of the three subsequent fractions, III-1 and III-2 showed
the strongest suppression of glucose production at 56 and 64%, respectively.
These two fractions were pooled and subjected to successive preparative
RP-HPLC, yielding compounds 1–9.

Isolation and Identification
of Compounds 1–9 from L. longiflorum Bulbs
Subfractions III-1
and III-2 were pooled together (III-1/2) and fractionated by semipreparative
RP-HPLC (Figure 4),
yielding compounds 1–9 (Figure 5). All structures were determined through
1D 1H and 2D NMR.15,20 Low levels of saponins
were also present in the fractions, although they were not explored
further in this work.21

from L. longiflorum Fraction (III-1/2).

Figure 5 Structures of compounds 1–9 identified in L. longiflorum.

The first five compounds identified
were phenylpropanoid glycerol
glucosides, previously reported from the bulbs of L.
longiflorum.(12,17) Compound 1 was confirmed to be (2S)-1-O-caffeoyl-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosylglycerol. The structure
consisted of a glucosylated glycerol backbone and caffeoyl moiety.
Using ESI––MS, a base peak was observed at m/z 415 (100, [M – H]−), consistent with MW 416 (see the Supporting Information for MS spectra of 1–9). Compound 2, (2R)-1-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-2-O-p-coumaroylglycerol, consisted
of glucose connected at the C1 of the glycerin backbone and an acyl
group at C2 to connect the p-coumaroyl. For compound 2, a base ion peak was observed at m/z 399 (100, [M – H]−), consistent
with MW 400. Compound 3, (2S)-1-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosylglycerol, is an isomer of 2 differing
only by the glycerol linkage, in that C2 350 connects to the glucose
and C1 to the acyl group. Similar to 2, a base peak was
observed at m/z 399 (100, [M – H]−). The p-coumaroyl 3 was the most predominant
phenylpropanoid glycerol glucoside found in the L.
longiflorum bulb.12 Both
compounds 4, (2S)-1-O-caffeoyl-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-acetylglycerol, and 5, (2S)-1-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-acetylglycerol,
were acetylated with the only difference being the caffeoyl and coumaroyl
groups, respectively. Compound 4 showed a base peak at m/z 457 (100, [M – H]−), consistent with MW 458. Both caffeoyl compound 1 and
its acetylated derivative 4 were reported to have the
highest concentrations in the leaf and flower tissues, respectively.12 For compound 5, a base peak was
observed at m/z 441 (100, [M –
H]−), consistent with MW 442. The acetylated compounds 4 and 5 had the overall highest concentrations
in the L. longiflorum buds. Compound 6, (2S)-1-O-p-coumaroylglycerol, was identified in the fresh bulbs of L. longiflorum and is a phenolic monoacylated glycerol.17 This compound showed an ion at m/z 237 (100, [M – H]−),
consistent with MW 238. Compound 7, (2)-hydroxy-3-O-p-coumaroyl-1,2-propanedicarboxylic acid,
has been previously reported in L. longiflorum.(19) The compound is a p-coumaroyl ester of dihydroxydicarboxylic acid. Compound 7 showed ions at 309 (100, [M – H]−) and
163 (32, [M – 146]), consistent with MW 310. Both compound 8, 3,6′-diferuloylsucrose, and compound 9, 4-acetyl-3,6′-diferuloylsucrose, were previously identified
in the bulb flesh of Lilium pardalinum, Lilium auratum, and L. longiflorum.(17,20) Their structures
consist of sucrose esters with decorating feruloyl moieties on the
C3 of the fructose and C6′ of the glucose. They differed in
that compound 9 is acetylated at C4 of the fructose moiety.
For compound 8, a base peak was observed at m/z 693 (100, [M – H]−),
consistent with MW 694, and compound 9 had a base ion
at m/z 735 (100, [M – H]−), consistent with MW 736.

Evaluation of Purified
Compounds 1–9
The effects of the compounds
(1–9) were tested
for inhibitive activity at 10 μM using cellular hepatic assays
(Figure 6). Of the
nine compounds examined, compounds 1–3 were effective
at reducing glucose production by 39.2, 36.8, and 51.2%, respectively;
however, there was no statistically significant distinction between
their activity. The next compound examined, compound 4, an acetylated derivative of compound 1, reduced glucose
production by 32.0% but was not significantly different from its nonacetylated
counterpart compound 1.

Figure 6 Effect of compounds 1–9 on H4IIE rat hepatoma
glucose production expressed as the percent of the induced control.
Mean glucose suppression ± SEM. Abbrev: Cont (Neg. control),
DC (Dex-cAMP), Ins (Dex-cAMP + insulin). Each number corresponds to
that compound.

Comparatively, other
compounds were found to be ineffective inhibitors,
with compound 5 showing only a 3.6% decrease in glucose
production. Comparing compounds 3 and 5 suggests
natural acetylation reduces antigluconeogenic activity (Figure 7). Both compounds 6 (phenolic monoacylated glycerol) and 7 were weak inhibitors,
reducing glucose production by 16.5 and 3.6%, respectively. Furthermore,
compounds 8 and 9 (sucrose esters) showed
mild suppression of glucose production by 11.0 and 24.0%, respectively.
Compounds 6–9 were statistically identical, yet 8 and 9 possessed a glucoside group decorated
with additional fructose and ferulic acid groups, while compounds 6 and 7 did not. The key compositional difference
between compounds 8 and 9 was an acetyl
moiety, which is particularly interesting since the acetyl moiety
in compounds 3 and 5 strongly controlled
the inhibitory activity, yet there was no statistical difference in
activity between compounds 8 and 9. Notably,
there was no significant difference between compounds 5−9 and the control. As a result, the acetyl impacts
the inhibitory activity and is dependent upon its location on the
compound.

Figure 7 Structural diagram of compounds 3 and 5 depicts how natural acetylation of 3 reduces activity.

The class of compounds identified
here as 1–5, phenylpropanoid glycerol
glucosides, have been reported
throughout the Easter lily tissues and are commonly named regalosides.
These compounds are acylated glycerol glucosides often containing p-coumaric, ferulic, or caffeic acids. Regalosides have
a glucosylated glycerol backbone esterified at the C1 or C2 carbon,
with either an S configuration at the 2-position,
(2S)-regalosides being the most prevalent, or an R configuration, (2R)-regalosides being
less common. Regalosides have been reported to show bioactivity, such
as in the extracts of L. casablanca flower buds that contained regaloside 1 (an isomer of compound 5) which suppressed UVA-induced alterations in human dermal
fibroblast morphology.22 In the current
study system, the glucoside may act as a vehicle, engaging the molecule
in gluconeogenesis, while additional groups may become subsequently
engaged to establish inhibitory activity. However, to date, the bioactivity
of regalosides as hepatic gluconeogenesis inhibitors has not been
reported.

Comparing the inhibitory activity of these structurally
similar
compounds reveals that the location of decorating moiety groups, more
so than their presence, significantly impacts the strength of their
activity. Compounds 1–3 differ by their caffeoyl
and coumaroyl groups, and glucoside linkages, suggesting that the
number of −OH moieties located on the phenolic group is crucial
to differential activity. Cinnamoyl glucosides have not been examined
in this cell line, and so the role of the hydroxy groups is not completely
established. The premise of location over the presence of groups in
determining activity is emphasized when considering the glucoside
group. Compounds 6 and 7 have no glucoside
group and showed only weak activity, while compounds 1, 3, and 8 all have a glucoside group,
but compound 8 was shown to be a weak inhibitor, while 1 and 3 were strong. The importance of the glucoside
group is also emphasized by comparing these results with previous
reports investigating the inhibitory activity of 3-caffeoylquinic
acid and its major groups.5 In this previous
work, both 3-caffeoylquinic acid and its major tail caffeoyl group
showed similar inhibitory activity, 45% at 3.5 μg/mL and 50%
at 5.4 μg/mL, while the isolated quinic acid group did not.
This finding suggests that the inhibitory activity may originate in
the caffeoyl group, consistent with our results from compound 1, that showed a 39.2 % reduction in activity. Still, we report
a nominally enhanced activity in compound 3 by exchanging
the caffeoyl group for a coumaroyl group. Based on these previous
results, the isolated coumaroyl group, compound 6, should
show similar inhibitory activity to compound 3. However,
compound 6 showed a diminished inhibitory activity of
only 16.5%, compared to compound 3, which showed 51.2%.
This result implies that there is a strong reliance on the entire
structure, which is distinctly different from previous reports.5

In summary, following activity-guided fractionation,
a new class
of compounds was identified as candidate hepatic glucose production
inhibitors in L. longiflorum. Investigating
the inhibitory activity of the five identified phenylpropanoid glycerol
glucosides and structurally similar compounds reveals a strong dependence
of activity on the moiety number and location. In hepatic glucose
inhibitory assays, glucose production was suppressed by more than
50%, at concentrations of 10 μg/mL. This report is the first
of phenylpropanoid glycerol glucosides as natural product hepatic
glucose production inhibitors. The results of this study present a
new class of natural dietary products that may be further investigated
for their potential to control metabolic syndrome and potentially
delay the subsequent onset of type II diabetes.
