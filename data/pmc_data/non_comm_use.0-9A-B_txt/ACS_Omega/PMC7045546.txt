Drilling fluids with poor filtration
property are disadvantageous
for well drilling, easily causing wellbore instability and formation
collapse. This work reports the novel utilization of tea polyphenols
(TPs) as a fluid loss additive in the bentonite–water-based
drilling fluids (BT-WDFs). The influence of TP concentration and temperature
on the filtration property of the fluids was described. The results
showed that an increase in the TP concentration contributed to a decrease
in fluid loss. Especially BT-WDFs added with 3.0 wt % TP exhibited
a low fluid loss (less than or approximately 10 mL) at room temperature
and high temperatures (∼150 °C), displaying better filtration
property and temperature resistance than common fluid loss agents.
Through the investigations on the viscosity, the particle size of
TP/BT-WDFs, and micromorphology of filter cakes, the dispersion effect
of TP was considered as the dominant factor for the filtration property
of TP/BT-WDFs. TP molecules, containing many functional groups, could
attach to the surface of bentonite platelets, improve the hydration
of bentonite particles, and promote the dispersion of bentonite particles.
At room temperature, TP facilitated the dispersion of hydrated bentonite.
The existing “house-of-cards” structure was weakened,
decreasing the particle size and viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs. At high
temperature, bentonite dehydrated and aggregated, thereby increasing
the particle size of bentonite particles, decreasing the viscosity
of bentonite dispersion, and resulting in a high fluid loss. The addition
of TP dispersed bentonite from face-to-face (FF) attraction to edge-to-face
(EF) attraction, recovered the house-of-cards structure, and increased
the viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs. Under the dispersion effect of TP, an
appropriate grain composition of bentonite particles was formed and
the pore throats were plugged to prevent the penetration of water.
Finally, a compact and thin filter cake was built and the fluid loss
was greatly reduced. The TP/BT-WDFs exhibited good filtration property.
TP is a prospective candidate to be a high-performance and biodegradable
fluid loss additive in well-drilling applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Drilling fluid is an important
functional fluid in the well-drilling
operation. The success of drilling operations greatly depends on the
performance of drilling fluids. In the drilling process, drilling
fluids are pumped from the surface into subsurface reservoirs through
the drilling string. They perform important roles such as cleaning
the rock fragments, balancing formation pressure, stabilizing the
borehole wall, and cooling and lubricating drilling tools.1,2 Due to the cost and environmental requirements, water-based drilling
fluids (WDFs) are more commonly used. The WDFs are mainly composed
of water, bentonite (BT), and various chemical agents (fluid loss
additive, tackifier, shale inhibitor, etc.).3 The filtration property is one of the most important properties
for WDFs. In the case of a poor filtration property, too much water
will penetrate into the formation and form a thick filter cake. This
may lead to formation damage, borehole collapse, pipe sticking, and
eventually an increase in drilling costs.4 Therefore, over the past decades, a great number of additives have
been employed to reduce the filtration volume of WDFs, for example,
starch,5,6 polyanionic cellulose (PAC),7 copolymers,8−10 humic acid,11 phenolic
resin,12 graphene,13 and nanosilica.14−16

Tea polyphenols (TPs), as one of the most extensive
plant polyphenols
worldwide, have received much attention from the daily chemical, pharmaceutical,
and food industries owing to their extraordinary antioxidative and
antibacterial characteristics.17,18 The major polyphenols
in TPs are flavonols, and the major components in flavonols are catechins.
In detail, there are four major components in catechins, including
(−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (−)-epigallocatechin
(EGC), (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), and (−)-epicatechin
(EC). EGCG accounts for 50–70% of catechins and is the major
catechin in TPs.19 TPs are water-soluble
and quite stable with good temperature-resistant property and oxidation-resistant
property. Based on these special characteristics, TPs have been widely
applied in the engineering field and demonstrated good thermal stability,
antioxidative property, and emulsion stabilization ability. In fact,
some plant-based phenolic materials have been employed as chemical
additives in petroleum engineering due to their distinctive characteristics
(biodegradability, water-solubility, surface activity, adsorption
dispersibility, etc.). As a kind of phenolic materials, the utilization
of TPs as more effective fluid loss additives in the WDFs is worth
researching.

The filtration property of BT-WDFs is greatly influenced
by the
filter cake quality and filtrate viscosity.2,20,21 Various fluid loss additives have been used
to reduce fluid loss by increasing the filtrate viscosity and improving
the filter cake quality. Nanoparticles could plug the pores in filter
cakes as sealing agents to decrease the filter cake permeability.
Some copolymers, such as acrylamide-based copolymers, can be adsorbed
onto clay particles and form a hydration shell, preventing the aggregation
of clay particles.22 Downhole, the conditions
are pretty complex, especially at high temperatures. Drilling fluid
additives must possess high-temperature resistance. Therefore, it
is necessary to evaluate the filtration property when adding TPs at
high temperatures.

This work aims to study the promising application
of TPs as biodegradable
fluid loss additives in BT-WDFs and uncover the underlying mechanism.
The characteristics (e.g., solubility of the TP solution, ζ-potential,
morphology, and thermogravimetric property) of TPs were studied. The
lower fluid loss was observed with increase in the concentration of
TPs. Through the investigations on the viscosity, the particle size
distribution of TP/WDFs, and micromorphology of filter cakes, the
filtration mechanism of TPs was proposed.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Materials
TP (purity ≥98%)
extracted from green tea leaves was purchased from Qingdao Yousuo
Chemical Technology (China). Bentonite was obtained from Huaian Tengfei
Development Co., Ltd. (China). Carboxymethyl starch (CMS) was purchased
from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (China). Polyanionic cellulose
(PAC) was obtained from the China National Offshore Oil Corporation
(CNOOC). All of the chemicals were used without further purification.

2.2 Characterization of TP
2.2.1 Proton
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR)
The 1H NMR spectrum of TP was recorded
with a Bruker AVANCE III 600M NMR apparatus. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was used as the solvent.

2.2.2 TP Solution Stability
The TP solutions
at different pH values were prepared to observe their solution forms
and stability.

2.2.3 ζ-Potential
The ζ-potential
of TP solutions at different pH values was measured by a Malvern Zetasizer
Nano series. The concentration of all of the samples in this test
was about 1.0 g L–1.

2.2.4 Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
The TGA and derivative thermogravimetry curves
of TPs were measured
by PE Pyris 1 in the temperature range of 50–500 °C at
a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 and under an
N2 gas flow.

2.2.5 Biodegradability Test
The biodegradability
of the TPs was evaluated through the BOD5/CODcr method. In the petroleum industry, the values of BOD5/CODcr in the range of <1.0, 1.0–5.0, and >5.0%
represent hardly degradable, nondegradable, and biodegradable, respectively.

2.3 Preparation of BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs
Four percent BT-WDFs were prepared by adding 4% (w/v) bentonite in
distilled water and stirring at 1500 rpm for 12 h, followed by static
standing for 24 h. Then, 1, 2, and 3% (w/v) TPs were dissolved in
4% BT-WDFs with stirring at 5000 rpm for 30 min and the pH of the
TP/BT-WDFs was adjusted to 9 by adding NaOH aqueous solution.

2.4 Filtration Tests of BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs
Filtration
tests were carried out by the American Petroleum Institute
(API) guidelines.3,23 About 250 mL of the fluids (BT-WDFs
or TP/BT-WDFs) were poured into a standard filter press (Fann Instrument
Company) equipped with reinforced filter paper (9 mm in diameter and
2.7 μm in pore size). The filtration tests were conducted under
a pressure of 100 psi using N2 gas chargers for 30 min.
The volume of fluid loss was recorded at 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 7.5, 15, and
30 min after each test had begun.

For high-temperature filtration
tests, the fluids were first added into a sealed jar. Then, the jar
was hot-rolled in a BGRL-5 roller furnace (Qingdao, China) at 120
and 150 °C for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, the fluid
loss was measured as mentioned above.

2.5 Rheology
Analysis of BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs
The rheological properties
of BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs were measured
through a Haake Mars rheometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham,
MA). The apparent viscosity was measured under a shear rate from 1000
to 1 s–1. All of the tests were conducted at 25
°C. Before the rheological measurement, the dispersions were
stirred energetically for 30 min.

2.6 Microstructural
Analysis
The exterior
morphologies of BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs dispersions with different
TP concentrations were observed by a Leica DM4 M microscope with a
total magnification of 50×.

The particle size distributions
of BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs with different TP concentrations were measured
by a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyzer.

The microstructure
of dry filter cakes was observed by a SU8010
scanning electron microscope.

The association forms of bentonite
particles were observed through
a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characteristics of TP
The molecular
structure of the TP was first characterized. As mentioned above, the
major polyphenols in TP are catechins, which account for 60–80%
of the total TPs. In detail, there are four major tea catechins: EGCG,
EGC, ECG, and EC (as shown in Figure 1), among which EGCG was reported as the most abundant
ingredient. Meanwhile, the 1H NMR spectroscopy was also
used to characterize the structure of the TP. As shown in Figure 2, typical chemical
shift values in the TP were preliminary presented: δ = 2.6–2.9
ppm mainly for EGCG and ECG, δ = 4.6, 6.6, 6.8 ppm for EGC,
δ = 4.7 ppm for EC, δ = 5.0 ppm for ECG, δ = 4.9,
5.3, 5.8 ppm for mainly EGC, EGCG, and δ = 6.4 ppm for EGCG.24,25 The TP exhibited various polyphenol structures.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
major polyphenols in the TP.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectrum of the TP.

The ζ-potential of TP versus pH was first measured to evaluate
its charged nature (Figure 3). TP was almost negatively charged over the whole pH range.
There are many phenolic hydroxyls in TP molecules. These functional
groups can ionize and produce H+, thereby resulting in
the negative charge of TP. Due to the ionizing effect, the TP solution
was acidic and its natural pH was 2.51. A variety of external parameters
can affect the oxidation state of the TP solution, of which pH is
the most important one. The oxidation rate will improve with increase
in the pH value, which can be evident by the gradual deepening color
of the TP solution (Figure 3).

Figure 3 ζ-Potential of the TP solution at different pH values.

The TGA results were also analyzed (Figure 4). The slight mass loss for
TP from 50 to
150 °C corresponded to the evaporation of free water and crystal
water in the TP. After the temperature was subsequently increased
to 500 °C, the remaining weight of TP was still 58.28%. The TP
mass started to dramatically decrease at 210 °C, showing a high
thermal decomposition temperature. The results indicated that TP had
the potential to be used in high-temperature conditions.

Environmental protection property
is pretty important for drilling
fluid additives due to strict environmental regulations. According
to the previous literature,18,19,26 the TP was nontoxic and good for people’s health. However,
as a drilling fluid additive, there was no direct proof to show its
degradability. Thus, a biodegradability test was conducted to further
evaluate the environmental performance of the TP. As shown in Table 1, the value of the
BOD5/CODcr was 26.97%. The result proved that
the TP was environmentally friendly and biodegradable as a drilling
fluid additive.

3.2 Filtration Properties of TP in BT-WDFs
A series of API filtration tests for TP were conducted in 4% BT-WDFs
at different TP concentrations and temperatures (Figure 5a). The fluid loss of pure
BT-WDFs was as high as 23 mL within 30 min at room temperature. When
1.0, 2.0, and 3.0% TPs were added into BT-WDFs, 43.5, 58.3, and 59.1%
reductions in the fluid loss volume were achieved, respectively, displaying
an improved filtration property.

Figure 5 Plots of fluid loss versus time for BT-WDFs
at different TP concentrations
after aging at room temperature (a), 120 °C (b) and 150 °C
(c). The fluid loss volume (mL/30 min) of TP/BT-WDFs with different
TP contents under different temperatures (d).

The downhole temperature rises gradually with an increase in the
drilling depth, which might limit effective filtration control. Therefore,
we also measured the fluid loss variation of BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs
after aging at 120 and 150 °C (Figure 5b,c). For pure BT-WDFs, the fluid loss increased
dramatically with increase in the aging temperature, displaying a
poor filtration property at high temperatures. As expected, TP/BT-WDFs
still maintained remarkable filtration property. The fluid loss volume
was still further decreased with increase in the TP concentration
(as shown in Figure 5d). For example, when the aging temperature was 120 °C, the
addition of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0% TPs greatly decreased the fluid loss
from approximately 30 to 19.5, 13.4, and 9.5 mL, respectively. Moreover,
the fluid loss curve of fluid with the addition of 3.0% TP reached
a plateau after 15 min. Similar phenomenon was also observed at 150
°C. The fluid loss was reduced to 10.2 mL when 3.0% TP was added,
whereas that of pure BT-WDFs was about 50 mL at 150 °C. The improvement
in filtration property was beneficial for maintaining the stability
of borehole and avoiding the formation of collapse. These results
demonstrated that TP could be used as an effective fluid loss additive
in BT-WDFs.

Subsequently, the filter cakes obtained in the filtration
tests
were taken into account. Figure 6 shows the photos of fresh filter cakes formed by TP/BT-WDFs
at different TP concentrations and temperatures. For pure BT-WDFs,
bentonite particles will imbibe water and hydrate immediately when
dispersed in water, forming diffused electric double layers. This
will cause separation of individual bentonite layers and the formation
of typical “house-of-cards” structure, producing a desired
high viscosity of the bentonite dispersion. Finally, bentonite settled
to build a relatively thin and compact filter cake (Figure 6a), forming a barrier layer
to prevent the penetration of water. That was the typical filtration
mechanism for pure BT-WDFs. However, the filter cakes of BT-WDFs became
greatly thicker after aging at 120 and 150 °C (Figure 6a1,a2), demonstrating a deteriorated
filtration property. For TP/BT-WDFs, improved appearances of filter
cakes were seen by adding TPs with different concentrations (Figure 6b–d,b1–d1,b2–d2).
In detail, with the addition of 1.0% TP, the filter cake became thinner
and denser. This positive effect became stronger as the TP concentration
increased to 3.0%. Especially, the filter cake was almost transparent
after the addition of 3.0% TP at room temperature. In addition, very
thin, clear, and smooth filter cakes of TP/BT-WDFs were also observed
after aging at 120 and 150 °C, showing a better filtration property.
In addition, the thickness of the filter cakes was also measured to
show a quantitative description. As shown in Table 2, the thickness of the filter cakes from
pure BT-WDFs increased with an increase in the temperature. After
TP was reacted with BT-WDFs, the thickness of the filter cakes was
sharply reduced. For example, after 3% TP was added at 150 °C,
the thickness of the filter cake was 1.02 mm, which was slightly thinner
than that of pure BT-WDFs at room temperature. The filtration property
of BT-WDFs is greatly determined by the filter cake quality. A thinner
filter cake usually shows better filtration property. TP could improve
the filter cake quality and reduce the filter loss of BT-WDFs at temperatures
ranging from room temperature to 150 °C, showing the potential
of TP as an effective fluid loss additive.

cakes from TP/BT-WDFs at TP concentrations

temperature. Filter cakes (a1)–(d1) and (a2)–(d2) were
those of filter cakes (a)–(d) after aging at 120 and 150 °C.

150 °C	3.12	1.22	1.08	1.02	
To further evaluate the filtration
property of TP, some common
fluid loss additives were also tested at 150 °C to compare with
TP. Diverse fluid losses were obtained when different additives were
added at a fixed concentration of 3.0% (Figure 7a). Compared with CMS and PAC, the addition
of TP in BT-WDFs resulted in the lowest fluid loss. Moreover, the
filter cake of TP/BT-WDFs also performed the thinnest and the most
compact appearance (Figure 7b). CMS and PAC were common fluid loss additives in drilling
engineering, but these materials exhibited poor filtration property
under high temperature. The comparative tests further proved that
TP displayed better filtration property.

Figure 7 Fluid loss (a) and filter
cakes (b) of base fluids added with different
fluid loss additives after aging at 150 °C.

3.3 Characteristics of TP/BT-WDFs
As
mentioned above, the viscosity of fluids and filter cake quality are
two key factors that can influence the filtration property of drilling
fluids. Generally, the higher the viscosity, the lower the fluid loss.
Therefore, if the viscosity of drilling fluids is the dominant factor
for the filtration mechanism, drilling fluids with higher viscosity
should show lower fluid loss volumes. Therefore, the plots of viscosity
versus shear rate for TP/BT-WDFs at different TP concentrations and
temperatures were first evaluated (Figure 8). Distinctive trends of viscosity were observed
by incorporating TP at different temperatures. At room temperature,
pure BT-WDFs displayed typical shear thinning behavior and showed
higher viscosity than all of the TP/BT-WDFs samples. However, the
viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs presented a downward trend with the increase
of TP concentration. Meanwhile, with the increase in the temperature
from room temperature to 150 °C, the viscosity of pure BT-WDFs
decreased gradually. On the contrary, the viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs
became higher. Moreover, the viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs at 150 °C
was higher than that of pure BT-WDFs at 150 °C but still almost
equal or less than that of pure BT-WDFs measured at room temperature.
Besides, at the same temperature, the viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs always
showed a downward trend with increase in the TP concentration. Filtration
experimental results showed that the fluid loss decreased with an
increase in the TP concentration at every temperature. The above results
were contrary to the conception that drilling fluids with a higher
viscosity should have a lower fluid loss. Therefore, the viscosity
was not the primary factor for the filtration property of TP/BT-WDFs.

Figure 8 Plots
of viscosity versus shear rate for BT-WDFs at different TP
concentrations after aging at room temperature (a), 120 °C (b),
and 150 °C (c).

Subsequently, the particle
size of bentonite was also taken into
account for understanding the role of TP in the filtration process.
The particle size distribution of BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs at different
temperatures is shown in Figure 9. Distinct particle size distribution was obtained
after adding TP as a fluid loss additive, especially at high temperatures.
At room temperature, pure bentonite was homogeneously dispersed in
micron size. The addition of TP caused a smaller particle size. Compared
with pure BT-WDFs, a new peak denoting a smaller particle size arrange
appeared in the particle size distribution curves of TP/BT-WDFs. Especially,
the smaller particle size part was in nanoscale. At high temperatures,
the effect of decreasing particle size was more significant. For describing
the variation of particle size, the median diameter of the particles
(D50) and the volume average particle
diameter (Dv) were further measured (Figure 10). The D50 and Dv of pure
BT-WDFs increased dramatically after aging at high temperatures, correlating
to a high filter loss. On the contrary, after TP with different concentrations
was added, the D50 and Dv of TP/BT-WDFs decreased gradually, whereas the filtration
property was improved.

Figure 9 Particle size distribution of BT-WDFs at different TP
concentrations
after aging at room temperature (a), 120 °C (b), and 150 °C
(c).

Figure 10 D50 and Dv of BT-WDFs at different TP concentrations
after aging at different
temperatures.

In fact, the filtration property
of BT-WDFs is greatly influenced
by the particle size distribution of the solid phase in BT-WDFs. Generally,
the particles with an appropriately small size can have more access
to the pores and pore throats.27 Many solid
particles, such as nanosilica,28 ultrafine
calcium carbonate (CaCO3), laponite nanoparticles,29 and some fibrous materials, have been developed
and used as sealing agents. Satisfactory filtration property can be
achieved by choosing the appropriate nanoparticles that match the
size of pores. After adding TP, the particle size of bentonite became
smaller and exhibited a wide distribution range. Namely, TP could
promote the dispersion of bentonite particles, even at high temperatures.
The combination of nanosized and micron-sized clay particles contributed
to plugging the pore throats and forming an effective barrier layer
to prevent the penetration of water, thereby reducing the fluid loss.

3.4 Microstructural Analysis of TP/BT-WDFs
The micromorphology of bentonite particles was observed by microscopy
(Figure 11). Pure
bentonite dispersion displayed quite homogeneously distributed particles
at room temperature (Figure 11a). With an increase in the aging temperature, bentonite particles
aggregated and the particle size obviously increased. The addition
of TP as a filtration agent restored the bentonite to a smaller size,
which was consistent with the particle size measurement results. These
results further proved that TP could promote the dispersion of bentonite
and induce smaller particles, which was beneficial for reducing fluid
loss. The changing pattern of particle size of bentonite as a function
of TP concentration was identical to that observed for the fluid loss.
This demonstrated that the size change of bentonite particles might
be the predominant reason for the improved filtration property of
TP/BT-WDFs.

0 wt %,
(b) 1.0 wt %, (c) 2.0 wt %, and (d) 3.0 wt % at room temperature.
Images (a1)–(d1) and (a2)–(d2) were the TP/BT-WDFs after
aging at 120 and 150 °C, respectively. The graph scale length
is 500 μm.

SEM micrographs have
been usually applied to examine the influence
of fluid loss additives on the microstructure of dry filter cakes,
further elaborately accounting for filtration mechanism. The SEM micrographs
of dried filter cakes from TP/BT-WDFs are shown in Figure 12. For pure BT-WDFs, at room
temperature, bentonite could form a relatively compact filter cake
(Figure 12a). However,
at high temperatures, the bentonite aggregated and generated rough
morphology, especially at 150 °C. A large number of wrinkles
appeared on the surface of the filter cakes, and the surface was very
rough (Figure 12a1,a2).
These wrinkles seemed to be stacked in layers, indicating that there
might be many channels available for fluid penetration. For TP/BT-WDFs,
with the addition of TP, such stacked wrinkles gradually disappeared.
A more smooth and compact microstructure was clearly observed (Figure 12d–d2). Obviously,
the addition of TP improved the filter cake quality. The results were
also in accordance with that of filtration tests.

3.5 Filtration
Mechanism Analysis
Generally,
the bentonite platelets are negatively charged on the flat surface,
while the edges can be negative, neutral, or positive depending on
the pH value. Bentonite particles hydrate, swell, and disperse in
water. The ionic attraction between the negatively charged flat surface
and positively charged edge (edge-to-face (EF) attractions)30 forms a special house-of-cards structure, which
is responsible for the viscosity of bentonite dispersion.31 These special features enable bentonite to be
an ideal rheological and filtration material in BT-WDFs. However,
bentonite is sensitive to temperature. Under high-temperature conditions,
the adsorption of clay particles to water molecules becomes weak and
clay particles dehydrate and aggregate (Figures 9 and 11), thereby
resulting in thick filter cake and poor filtration property (Figures 5 and 6).

TP molecules contained many functional groups, such
as phenolic hydroxyls, carbonyls, and carboxyls. TP could be attached
to the surface of bentonite platelets via hydrogen bond between carbonyl/hydroxyl
groups of TP and hydroxyls groups of bentonite platelets. The negative
hydration groups in TP increased the electronegativity of bentonite,
improved the hydration of bentonite particles, and promoted the dispersion
of bentonite particles. At room temperature, bentonite fully hydrated
and dispersed in pure BT-WDFs. A house-of-cards structure was formed
by EF attraction (Figure 13a). The bentonite dispersion displayed quite a high viscosity,
showing typical shear-thinning non-Newtonian characteristics (Figure 8a). After the addition
of TP, the adsorption of TP further accelerated the dispersion of
bentonite and broke the house-of-cards structure (Figure 13b). Thus, the particle size
and viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs decreased with increase in the dosage
of TP (Figures 8a and 9a). At high temperature, as shown in Figure 13c, the bentonite in pure BT-WDFs
dehydrated, aggregated, and settled through face-to-face (FF) attraction
(Figure 14c). The
viscosity of pure BT-WDFs decreased and fluid loss increased sharply.
As exhibited in Figure 13d, the addition of TP dispersed bentonite from FF attraction
to EF attraction (Figure 14d). The house-of-cards structure was recovered and the particle
size of TP/BT-WDFs decreased again, as well as the viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs
increased (Figures 8c and 9c). Then, an appropriate grain composition
of bentonite particles was created and an effective barrier layer
was formed. Finally, a compact and thin filter cake was built and
the fluid loss was greatly reduced.

of the filter cakes from
BT-WDFs and TP/BT-WDFs at room temperature and high temperature.

The concentration of TP was 3.0%.

3.6 Cost Implication
The prices of different
fluid loss additives were investigated and compared (as shown in Table 3). Among these additives,
CMS had the lowest price, while TP was the most expensive. However,
in the above study, TP showed better filtration property than CMS
and PAC at the same concentration. The sulfonated phenolic resin (SMP)
was also a common fluid loss additive in the oilfield. However, this
material was restricted in use because of its toxicity. From the investigation,
although TP had good filtration property and was environmentally friendly,
it still had the problem of high cost.

4 Conclusions
In this work, TP was utilized as an effective
and environmentally
friendly fluid loss additive in BT-WDFs. The addition of TP could
effectively decrease the fluid loss at room temperature and high temperature
(∼150 °C), displaying better filtration property than
common fluid loss agents. Moreover, based on the investigations on
the viscosity, the particle size distribution of TP/BT-WDFs, and micromorphology
of filter cakes, the filtration mechanism of TP was also proposed.
The dispersion effect of TP was predominant for the filtration property
of TP/BT-WDFs. At room temperature, the addition of TP further promoted
the dispersion of bentonite, decreased the particle size of bentonite,
and increased the particle size distribution range. The house-of-cards
structure of bentonite was weakened, leading to a decrease of the
viscosity. At high temperature, pure bentonite dehydrated and aggregated
through FF attraction. The particle size of bentonite increased and
the viscosity of bentonite dispersion decreased sharply, leading to
a high fluid loss. The addition of TP dispersed bentonite from FF
attraction to EF attraction. Then, the house-of-cards structure was
recovered and the viscosity of TP/BT-WDFs was increased. As a result,
a compact and thin filtration cake was formed and the fluid loss was
reduced. Therefore, TP was expected to be used as an effective and
biodegradable fluid loss reducer in well-drilling applications. Meanwhile,
it still has some deficiencies. TP is more expensive than some conventional
fluid loss control materials, such as PAC and CMS. Besides, TP may
decay in drilling fluids and affect the durability of its effect.
Considering these concerns, it may be better to use TP in combination
with other fluid loss agents and fungicides.
