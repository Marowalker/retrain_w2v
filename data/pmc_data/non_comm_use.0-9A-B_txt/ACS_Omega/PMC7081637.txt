Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were prepared by a chemical
oxidation method using luffa sponge based activated carbon fiber as
the raw material. The obtained CQDs were well characterized. The fluorescence
quenching effect of Cr(VI) ion on CQDs was investigated. The results
show that the addition of Cr(VI) changes the intensity of the ultraviolet
characteristic absorption peak of CQDs, and causes static quenching
of the fluorescence of CQDs. With the increase in the Cr(VI) concentration,
the fluorescence of CQDs was gradually extinguished linearly.

==== Body
Introduction
Cr is one of the
main heavy metal elements that pollute the environment
and affects human health.1 Usually, the
toxicity of Cr is related to its valence state; Cr(VI) is 100 times
more toxic than Cr(III).2 Cr(VI) is widely
found in common industrial wastewaters because of its use in the electroplating,
metallurgy, printing, and dyeing and chemical industries, especially
in various solutions from the vanadium hydrometallurgical industry.3 Additionally, Cr(VI) discharged into environmental
water bodies directly cannot be biodigested without the standard treatment.
Under biomagnification, Cr(VI) is enriched into the human body through
the atmosphere, water body, and food chain, which can lead to the
occurrence of cancer lesions.4 Therefore,
Cr(VI) has become a key monitoring target in environmental monitoring
in various countries, and the measurement method for Cr(VI) has received
much attention from environmental monitors.5 The rapid and sensitive identification and measurement of Cr(VI)
are very important for environmental protection and human health.6

At present, the determination methods of
Cr(VI) concentration mainly include complex metric titration, electrochemical
analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography, ion chromatography,
atomic absorption spectrometry, and mass spectrometry.7,8 Although these methods are sensitive, they have disadvantages such
as a cumbersome pretreatment process for the sample to be tested,
the inability of miniaturizing the detection instrument, and inability
to perform time-resolved measurements.9 Compared with this method, the fluorescent probe method has the
advantages of simple sample pretreatment, fast response, wide linear
dynamic range, less spectral interference, and high sensitivity and
has become a common analytical method for the rapid detection of metal
ions.10−14 Among the fluorescent
probes, carbon quantum dot fluorescent probes are easy to synthesize
and cost less and their fluorescence can be adjusted. The application
of carbon quantum dots (referred to as CQDs) in the field of Cr(VI)
detection has become a research hotspot at home and abroad in recent
years.15−20 At present, various precursors have been employed to prepare CQD,
including carbon-based materials, synthetic chemicals, plant extracts,
and animal byproducts.21−24

Usually, oxidant or expensive equipment
is needed to prepare CQDs when carbon-based materials were used as
the carbon source. The common oxidant is nitric acid and sulfuric
acid, which could cause great harm to the environment.25−27 Therefore, the green preparation
method of CQDs, especially, environmental-friendly oxidant and simple
cut method using carbon-based materials should be developed.

In this study, CQDs were prepared using luffa sponge based activated
carbon fiber (referred to as LSACF) as raw materials. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report using ACF as the precursor.
In addition, CQDs were synthesized by chemical oxidation using H2O2 as the environmental oxidant. The obtained CQDs
were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy. The morphology, chemical composition, functional
groups, and fluorescence properties of the quantum dots, combined
with the UV–vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra
of Cr(VI) and CQDs mixtures, were investigated to explore the effect
of Cr(VI) on the fluorescence properties of CQDs. On this basis, a
method of identifying and quantifying Cr(VI) using CQDs as fluorescent
probes was established, which lays the foundation for rapid and highly
sensitive detection of Cr(VI).

Results
and Discussion
Morphological Characterization
Figure 1 a shows
the transmission electron micrograph of the CQDs. The CQDs were nearly
spherical with good dispersion. Figure 1b shows the crystal lattice of CQDs with a lattice
spacing of 0.27 nm, which is consistent with previous studies.28,29Figure 1c shows the
diffused ring pattern of the CQDs, which identifies the amorphous
phase of carbon of the CQDs.30 The particle
sizes of the CQDs were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS)
with the dominant size from 4 to 8 nm, as shown in Figure 1d.

Figure 1 (a) TEM image, (b) HRTEM
image (inset: lattice spacing), (c) SAED patterns, and (d) particle
size distribution (DLS) of CQDs.

Photoluminescence and Spectroscopic
Characterization
Figure 2a shows the
UV–vis spectrum of the CQDs. Two shoulder absorption peaks
can be observed at 238 nm, corresponding to an aromatic C=C
bond and the associated π–π* transition and an
approximately 290 nm due to the n−π* transition of the
aromatic sp2 (C=C) domains,31 which indicates the formation of CQDs. In the inset, the CQDs became
brown under the excitation of light while emitting bright green light
under the excitation of ultraviolet light. The result is different
from some previous studies. Mewada et al. prepared CQDs with an average
size of 7.5 nm using an aqueous extract of Trapa bispinosa peel as
a carbon source that emits blue light under ultraviolet light excitation.32 Arul et al. prepared CQDs with an average size
of 2.5 nm using Hylocereus undatus as
a carbon source with sizes ranging from 5 to 10 nm, and the same character
was obtained.33 Currently, the relatively
reliable theories for this result are quantum confinement theory and
defective field emission.34,35

Figure 2 (a) UV–vis
spectrum (inset: picture of carbon quantum
dot solution under visible light (left) and UV light (right)), (b)
full spectra of excitation and emission, (c) emission spectra obtained
at different excitation wavelengths, and (d) fluorescence decay lifetime
of CQDs under 360 nm excitation wavelengths.

Figure 2b shows the full spectra of
excitation and emission of CQDs. The fluorescence intensity maximum
was obtained with excitation at 360 nm. Figure 2c shows the emission spectra obtained at
different excitation wavelengths for the CQDs. It is shown that a
red shift occurs as the excitation wavelength is increased and the
maximum fluorescence intensity is reached with excitation at 360 nm.
The luminescence mechanism of the excitation wavelength dependence
is still unclear. It is generally believed that the luminescence is
derived from a defect existing on the surface of the CQDs, which acts
as an excitation energy trap and emits light under the excitation
of a certain wavelength of light.

Figure 2d shows the fluorescence decay lifetime of
the CQDs under 360 nm excitation. The CQDs have two fluorescence decay
lifetimes of 1.8 and 6.7 ns, and further calculation shows 4.1 ns
is the average fluorescence decay lifetime. Using quinine sulfate
(54%, 0.1 mol/L H2SO4) as reference material,
the fluorescence quantum yield of the CQDs was determined to be 2.1%,
which is lower than that of CQDs prepared by others.36,37 The possible reason is related to the lack of incorporating a passivating
agent and heteroatoms in the preparation process.

Structure Characterization
The functional
groups on CQDs surface were analyzed using the FTIR analysis. Figure 3a shows the FTIR
spectrum of the CQDs. A broad band at 3419 cm–1 corresponds
to the −OH stretching vibration peak.38 The peak at 1715 is ascribed to the C=O group. The peaks
at 1602 and 1433 cm–1 are assigned to the −COO
group. The appearance of peaks at 1263 and 1165 cm–1 is due to C–O–C stretching vibration group. A C–C
stretching vibration peak appears at 634 cm–1. The
presences of −COOH and −OH groups provides the water
solubility of the CQDs.

Figure 3 (a) FTIR, (b)
XRD, and (c) Raman spectra of
CQDs.

Figure 3b shows the XRD pattern of the CQDs. A distinct broad
absorption peak appeared at approximately 27.6°, indicating the
amorphous carbon structure of the CQDs. In addition, there is also
a very small diffraction peak at 44°, corresponding to the (100)
crystal plane of graphite, which means that the carbon fiber has a
certain degree of graphitization.

Figure 3c shows the Raman spectrum of the CQDs. Generally,
the intensities of the D peak (at approximately 1354 cm–1) and G peak (at approximately 1594 cm–1) are employed
to determine the degree of graphitization of a sample. However, the
Raman spectrum of the CQDs shows that G peak (indicating crystallinity)
and D peak (indicating the degree of disorder) are not significant,
which is caused by the interference of the intense fluorescence from
the carbon quantum dots.39,40 Therefore, no certain
result was obtained from the Raman spectra of CQDs.

Detection of
Cr(VI) Ions
To study the application
of the prepared CQDs as a metal fluorescent probe for Cr(VI), Cr(VI)
ions were used to test their effect on the PL value of the CQDs. Besides,
other metal ions (K+, Mg2+, Zn2+,
Cr3+, Na+, Al3+, and Ca2+) were selected to study their effect on the PL value of the CQDs.

Figure 4a shows
the emission spectra obtained at different Cr(VI) concentrations.
As the Cr(VI) concentration increased from 0 to 0.4 μg/L, the
fluorescence intensity of the CQDs decreased gradually at 473 nm emission,
which indicates that Cr(VI) has the fluorescence quenching effect
on the CQDs.

Figure 4 (a) Emission
spectra obtained at different Cr(VI) concentrations, (b) the normal
curve of F0/F under excitation
at 360 nm, and (c) the effect of other metal ions on F0/F.

Figure 4b shows the normal curve of F0/F for the CQDs. F0 is the fluorescence
intensity of the CQDs at 473 nm emission with no addition of Cr(VI)
and F is the fluorescence intensity of the CQDs at 473 nm emission
with different concentrations of Cr(VI). The obtained linear correlation
coefficient R2 is 0.989, which indicates a good linear
relationship between the fluorescence intensity of the CQDs and the
concentration of Cr(VI). The results show the promising potential
of the CQDs for a fast and easy determination of Cr(VI). Balavigneswaran
et al used self-made silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as the probe to
quickly detect the concentration of Cr(VI), and the obtained results
were good. However, AgNPs are a kind of metal material and have a
relatively high cost so that extensive use of this material is difficult.41 Zheng et al. developed salicylaldehyde rhodamine
B hydrazone (SRBH) as a new spectrofluorometric probe to detect the
concentration of Cr(VI), and a good linear relationship between the
concentrations of (SRBH) and Cr(VI) was achieved.42 However, the additional H2SO4 was
significantly necessary to enhance the blank fluorescence of probe.
Therefore, the CQDs used in this study show the advantages of simple
operation and environmental-friendly material.

Figure 4c shows the effect of other
metal ions (K+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, Na+, Al3+, and Ca2+) on
the PL value of the CQDs. The results demonstrate the negligible effect
of these metal ions on the PL value of the CQDs, which confirms the
availability of CQDs to determine the Cr(VI) concentration.

The fluorescence quenching mechanism of Cr(VI) on CQDs has been investigated.
The inner filter effect (IFE) is employed to explain the fluorescence
quenching mechanisms of CQDs. As reported in previous literature,
Cr(VI) exhibits broad absorption at 260, 360, and 440 nm, respectively.43 The excitation spectrum of LSACF CQDs has the
obvious excitation band at 360 nm and the emission band at 473 nm
under the excitation of 360 nm. There is an obvious overlapping in
the excitation spectrum, indicating that Cr(VI) can shield the excitation
light for CQDs. Therefore, the increasing Cr(VI) concentration could
lead to the more strong fluorescence quenching of CQDs, which ensures
that the IFE occurs in a highly efficient way.43

In addition, the quenching effect kinetic mechanism
was been investigated. Generally, fluorescence quenching usually is
caused by the static quenching effect (SQE), or the dynamic quenching
effect (DQE), or both.44 The ground-state
complex formation model of DQE and SQE can be described by the Stern–Volmer
equation (eq 1) 1  where KSV is the quenching constant, τ0 is the
average lifetime of CQDs (4.1 ns), and Kq is the quenching rate constant. For Cr(VI) sensing, Kq was calculated to be 6.86 × 1012 M–1 s–1. The obtained Kq is much higher than the maximum scatter collision quenching constant
(1.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1), which indicates a static quenching.

Conclusions
In
this study, CQDs were prepared by chemical
oxidation using LSACF. The obtained CQDs have a uniform particle size
with an average particle size of 6.8 nm and good solubility. The PL
intensity of the CQDs depends on excitation wavelength and the CQDs
emit green light under 365 nm UV light. In addition, the application
of CQDs as a metal probe was tested using Cr(VI) as the target metal.
As the Cr(VI) concentration increased, the fluorescence quenching
rate of the CQDs increased. At present, the CQDs prepared using LSACF
still have some shortcomings, such as obvious aggregation and low
quantum yield, which still need to be improved in the future.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instruments
Luffa sponge was purchased
from
Luohe Huahui Daily Necessities Co., Ltd. All of the reagents employed,
including hydrogen peroxide, potassium dichromate, calcium chloride,
chromium trichloride, zinc chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium
chloride, aluminum chloride, and sodium chloride, were analytical
grade and applied without any further purification. An aqueous Cr(VI)
solution was prepared using distilled water.

The TEM measurements
were performed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope
(JEM-2100F). The RS measurements were performed using a confocal microscopic
Raman spectrometer (InVia). The PL measurements were performed using
a spectrofluorometer (Sigma). The spectrophotometric measurements
were measured using a UV–vis spectrometer (UNICOWFUV-2). The
XRD analysis was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance).
FTIR analysis was performed using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(Nexus). The dynamic light scattering (DSL) test was performed using
a dynamic light scattering particle size analyzers (NANOZS). Other
general instruments included an electronic balance (BS223S), a tubular
resistance furnace (SK2-4-12A), a centrifuge (TG16-II), a drying box
(DGG-9123A), a magnetic stirrer (TWCL-D), a lyophilizer (JL-D10N-50C),
and an oil bath (HH-1S).

Preparation
of LSACF
The luffa sponge was oxidized, carbonized, and activated
by a high-temperature tubular resistance furnace. The heating process
of the resistance furnace is as follows: heating at 8 °C/min
to 200 °C for 120 min, then heating to 750 °C for 70 min,
and then cooling naturally; the resistance furnace was fed with N2 (flow rate is 0.7 L/min) as a protective gas; the obtained
product was luffa sponge activated carbon fiber (LSACF).

Preparation
of LSACF-Based CQD
Two grams
of LSACF powder was added to a round-bottom flask followed by 100
mL of hydrogen peroxide (15%) and sonication for 30 min before heating
in an oil bath for 24 h at 100 °C. The round-bottom flask was
removed after the reaction, naturally cooled, and filtered using a
0.45 μm polyethersulfone membrane. The filtrate was centrifuged
in a centrifuge for 15 min at 10 000 rpm, and then the supernatant
was again filtered through a 0.22 μm needle-type syringe filter.
The obtained filtrate was dialyzed into a dialysis bag with a molecular
weight of 2000 d. The dialysis time was 2 days, with changing water
intervals of 24 h. After the completion of the dialysis, the freeze-dried
solid powder is the desired CQDs.

Calculation of Quantum
Yield (QY) and Fluorescence Decay Lifetime
Determination
of fluorescence quantum yield: quantum yield was
determined by the reference method. Quinoline sulfate (referred to
as QS) with 55% QY was used as a reference standard. The fluorescence
integral area and absorbance value (A) of carbon
quantum dots (CQD) and quinoline sulfate solutions were measured at
the same excitation wavelength. The fluorescence quantum yield of
the CQDs was obtained according to the following eq 2 2  where QY is
the fluorescence quantum yield
in %, I is the fluorescence integral area, A is the absorbance of the incident light, and n is the refractive index of the solvent. The fluorescence quantum
yield of the CQDs was determined to be 2.1%.

The exponential
decay curve was fitted to calculate the fluorescence decay lifetime.
The following eq 3 was
employed in the fitting45 3  where A is the weight coefficient, τ is the fluorescence decay lifetime,
and I is the fluorescence intensity. The CQDs have
two fluorescence decay lifetimes of 1.8 and 6.7 ns.

Determination
of Cr(VI) Using CQDs
The
solid CQDs sample was diluted to the appropriate 1 mg/L using pure
water, and then 2 mL of the solution including Cr(VI) ion was added
to the CQDs solution in a ratio of 1:1. After mixing, the PL value
of the CQDs was measured.
