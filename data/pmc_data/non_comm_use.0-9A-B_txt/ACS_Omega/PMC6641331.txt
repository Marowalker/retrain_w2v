Understanding
molecular diffusion across the interfaces in planar
heterojunctions is fundamentally important to improving the performance
and stability of organic electronic devices. In this study, we quantitatively
evaluated the diffusion of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid
methyl ester (PCBM) across the interface of planar heterojunctions
into the polymer layers by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy.
Careful calibration allowed the concentration of PCBM to be determined
in the polymer layer at concentrations as low as 0.01 wt %. We found
that approximately 1 wt % PCBM was present in the poly(3-hexylthiophene)
layer in the planar heterojunction with no thermal treatments, indicating
that a small amount of PCBM diffused into the polymer layer even at
room temperature. The diffusion behavior depended strongly on the
crystallinity of the PCBM layer and the properties of the polymer
layers such as glass transition temperature. Further analysis suggested
that the diffusion of PCBM into the polymer layers was also related
to the interface free energy between the layers.

Introduction
Planar heterojunction
(PHJ) structures consisting of stacked layers
of organic semiconducting materials are used for various organic optoelectronic
devices. Multilayered PHJs are widely used in organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) to control the charge transport and light-emitting
positions precisely.1−3 PHJs are also used in organic photovoltaics (OPVs)
as model systems for mixed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures because
PHJs can eliminate the complicated effects of the mixing morphology
in BHJs and reveal the correlation between the material properties
and the device performance more directly.4−7 PHJs with electron donor and acceptor
materials have been used to investigate the electronic structure near
the interface by photoelectron spectroscopy8−10 and the charge
generation process by ultrafast spectroscopy11 and to evaluate exciton diffusion length in materials by interfacial
fluorescence quenching.12−14 PHJs have been also used to elucidate
the mixing behavior of the semiconducting materials by observing the
evolution of the mixed structures during the thermal treatment of
PHJs.15−22

It is often assumed that PHJs have a smooth interface and
that
each layer consists of the pure materials. Experimentally, however,
it is difficult to construct well-defined PHJ structures without intermixing
of the materials at the interfaces. Preparation of PHJs by vacuum
deposition or sequential spin-coating can cause the intermixing of
two molecules near the interface or even the diffusion of the molecules
into the whole layer.23−29 We previously showed that the contact film transfer (CFT) method
can be used to construct the well-defined PHJ structures.30,31 X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and the depth profiles obtained by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the interface is flat
and there is no substantial intermixing at the interfaces of PHJs
made by the CFT method.32 We observed the
effects of the interfacial modifications in PHJs, such as the introduction
of dipole moments and energetic cascade structures on their photovoltaic
performance, which suggests that the surface structures of the films
are maintained at the interface of PHJs during CFT.33−35 However, this
does not mean that each layer is pure because neither XRR nor depth
profiles of XPS can detect the molecular diffusion of less than several
percent. A low level of molecular diffusion can affect the photophysical
properties of the organic electronics, such as quenching of the excitons
and charge recombination. However, such small amount of diffused molecules
in PHJs for OLEDs or OPVs has never been quantified.

To quantify
the small amount of diffused molecules in PHJs, secondary
ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) is a powerful tool for analyzing the
components of the organic thin films with high sensitivity. Dynamic
(D)-SIMS has been used to investigate [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PCBM) diffusion into polymer layers by thermal
annealing.15,16,36 In D-SIMS measurements, owing to the high primary ion intensity,
organic molecules are decomposed to atomic fragments; hence, it is
often necessary to label the target molecules with deuterium. In contrast,
static time-of-flight (ToF)-SIMS can ionize target molecules with
less decomposition because the amount of the primary ion is much smaller
than that of D-SIMS. ToF-SIMS can analyze film surfaces without the
deuteration of the materials because the assignment of the mass spectra
to the targeted molecules is straightforward.37,38 Combined with Ar cluster ion as an etching source, ToF-SIMS can
produce reliable depth profiles of the molecules, with little damage
to the organic materials.39−42 The disadvantage of ToF-SIMS is its difficulty in
quantification, mainly due to the dependence of the secondary ionization
efficiency on the materials. The quantitative analysis of the low-level
molecular diffusion occurring at a low temperature have not been investigated
by ToF-SIMS in the bilayer structures.

In this study, we systematically
carried out quantitative analysis
of PCBM diffusion into various polymer films at room temperature.
Sample structures of PCBM//polymer PHJs were used, where // denotes
the interface prepared by the CFT method (Figure 1a) and the concentration of PCBM in the polymer
layer was evaluated by ToF-SIMS measurements. Careful calibration
of the sensitivity allowed the concentration of PCBM to be determined
in the polymer layer in PHJs at concentrations as low as 0.01 wt %.
The diffusion behavior of PCBM was discussed on the basis of the crystallinity
of each organic layer and the polymer properties.

Results and Discussion
To calibrate
PCBM concentration to the signal intensity of ToF-SIMS,
we performed measurements on the mixed thin films of PCBM and the
polymers with various PCBM concentrations prepared on a Si/SiO2 substrate. Figure 2a shows depth profiles of the PCBM signal intensity in the
mass spectra for the mixed films of PCBM and poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT) (see the Experimental Section for the
details of ToF-SIMS measurements). The sum of the intensities of the
negatively charged molecular peaks of C60 and PCBM was
used as the PCBM signal intensity. A representative mass spectrum
is shown in Figure S1. To eliminate the
variation of the primary ion-source intensity in each measurement,
PCBM signal intensities were normalized by those of SixOy– derived from the Si/SiO2 substrate (gray lines in Figure 2a). The PCBM signal
intensity clearly depended on its concentration in the mixed film. Figure 2b shows the calibration
line using the average PCBM signal intensity in 10–50 sputtering
cycles. Below 5 wt % PCBM concentration, the signal intensity had
a linear relation with the concentration, indicating that the signal
intensity can be converted to PCBM concentration in this range. In
contrast, the pristine PCBM film (PCBM concentration of 100 wt %)
showed a signal intensity much smaller than expected from the straight
calibration line. The intensity was even smaller than of that with
the concentration of 1 wt %. This deviation is due to the matrix effect
of ToF-SIMS, in which the secondary ionization efficiency of the molecules
is affected by their surroundings or the nearby substrates.43,44 A similar decrease in the ionization efficiency of PCBM at high
concentration in the mixed films with the semiconducting polymers
was observed previously.45 Thus, more careful
calibration would be necessary to quantify the high concentrations
of PCBM above 5 wt % expected for thermally treated PHJs or the mixed
BHJs for OPVs.

slope of 1.

The calibration allowed
the concentration of PCBM in the P3HT layer
in PHJs to be quantified. First, we investigated the effect of crystallinity
in the PCBM layer on its diffusion behavior. The PCBM thin film was
annealed at 155 °C for 10 min before making contact with the
P3HT film by the CFT method, which induced crystallization of PCBM,
as previously reported.46−48Figure 3a shows X-ray diffraction patterns in the
out-of-plane direction of the 30 nm thick PCBM film on a Si/SiO2 substrate before and after thermal annealing. Because the
cast film does not show any diffraction peaks, the film structure
was amorphous. After annealing at 155 °C for 10 min, the diffraction
peaks appeared, indicating that PCBM crystallized into the thin-film
phase.47

Figure 3 (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of the
PCBM thin film in the out-of-plane
direction before and after thermal annealing at 155 °C for 10
min. (b) Depth profiles of PCBM-normalized intensity from the Si/SiO2/PCBM (amorphous or crystal)//P3HT structure. That for a pristine
PCBM thin film is also shown for comparison.

The depth profiles of PCBM signal intensity in the PHJ samples
are shown in Figure 3b. We prepared two samples of Si/SiO2/PCBM (amorphous
or crystallized)//P3HT. The thickness of the PCBM and P3HT layers
were approximately 30 and 40 nm, respectively. The profile of pristine
PCBM is also shown for comparison. The regions with <180, 180–260,
and >260 sputtering cycles correspond to the P3HT and PCBM layers
and Si substrate, respectively, determined by the point with the half
intensity of the corresponding signals. We did not convert the sputtering
cycles into film thickness because the etching rate of each layer
may be different. PCBM mass spectrum was observed in the P3HT layer
of the PHJ samples, indicating that PCBM diffuses into the polymer
layer upon contact, even at room temperature. The PCBM signal intensity
from the P3HT layer was much lower in the crystallized PCBM//P3HT
sample than in the amorphous PCBM//P3HT sample. This result is consistent
with previous reports that the crystallization of the PCBM thin film
suppresses the diffusion of PCBM into the polymer layer during thermal
treatment.49,50 The PCBM concentrations in the
P3HT layers with the crystalline and the amorphous PCBM were 0.89–1.4
wt % and 2.0–2.5 wt %, respectively, for 10–100 sputtering
cycles. This diffusion of a small amount of PCBM into the polymer
layers at room temperature has not been reported previously, probably
due to the lack of a quantitative analytical method. PCBM was uniformly
distributed in the P3HT layer, or the concentration was slightly higher
in the region close to the surface. Near the interface between crystalline
PCBM and P3HT (150–180 sputtering cycles), the signal intensity
of PCBM appeared as a peak. There are two possible reasons for this:
the PCBM concentration was high near the interface, or this was an
artifact arising from the existence of the P3HT/PCBM interface. The
PCBM signal intensity deviated from the linear scale at high concentrations
owing to the matrix effect (Figure 2b). A similar effect could play a role at the interfacial
region even if there is no intermixing of the materials at the interface.
In the case of a noncrystalline PCBM sample, the doubled signal intensity
of PCBM in the bulk P3HT layer may obscure the interfacial phenomena
due to the limited depth resolution of ToF-SIMS measurement (∼9
nm; see Figure S4), leading to the monotonic
decrease of PCBM intensity at the interface. At this stage, it is
difficult to obtain an exact picture of the molecular distribution
near the heterointerface using ToF-SIMS measurement.

Figure 4a shows
depth profiles of PCBM concentration in four polymers: P3HT, regiorandom
P3HT (ran-P3HT), PTB7, and polystyrene (PS). PCBM layers were crystallized
by thermal treatment in all of the PHJ samples before making contact.
The calculated PCBM concentrations in the polymer layers after calibration
are listed in Table 1. The calibration lines for these polymers are shown in Figure S2. The PCBM signal in the ran-P3HT layer
was high compared to that in the P3HT layer. This indicates that the
amorphous ran-P3HT allows more PCBM diffusion into the polymer layer
compared with the crystalline regioregular P3HT. This result is consistent
with a previous report that PCBM tends to diffuse into the weakly
crystalline region near the grain boundaries of P3HT.15 We did not test the PHJ of amorphous PCBM and ran-P3HT,
which is predicted to exhibit higher PCBM diffusion because the higher
concentration of PCBM would not lie on the calibration line and would
be difficult to quantify. The small differences in the pristine PCBM
layer (180–260 sputtering cycles) in each measurement could
be due to inevitable deviation in the ToF-SIMS measurements and variation
in the matrix effect. PTB7 and PS are also less crystalline polymers,
similar to ran-P3HT,51 but they exhibited
much lower PCBM concentrations in the layers compared with ran-P3HT.
In particular, PCBM concentration in PS is lower than the detection
limit of this ToF-SIMS measurement (Figure 4b).

a Numbers in parentheses are standard
deviations of the four measured values.

The mixing behavior could be connected to a thermodynamic
factor
like the interface free energy after these polymers make contact with
the crystallized PCBM film. Table 1 shows the water contact angle of these polymers and
the calculated interface free energy with the crystalline PCBM film,
for which the water contact angle was 79.5°. The interface free
energy was calculated following Neumann’s analysis.52,53 The largest interface free energy appeared in the PCBM//P3HT and
PCBM//ran-P3HT interfaces, followed in order by PCBM//PTB7 and PCBM//PS.
This trend coincides with the order of PCBM concentration in the less
crystalline polymers, with the exception of the crystalline P3HT.
The interface free energy calculated using the contact angle of each
thin-film surface before making contact is the ideal value neglecting
the intermixing of the two materials. After making contact, diffusion
occurs that can reduce the interface free energy owing to the additional
entropic contribution by dispersing PCBM molecules into the polymer
layer. Owing to the high interface free energy, PCBM in contact with
ran-P3HT is more likely to diffuse into the polymer, whereas PCBM
molecules near the PS film do not.

However, the interface free
energy failed to explain the different
mixing behavior between P3HT and ran-P3HT that exhibited the similar
interface free energy. Because the system may not reach the thermodynamic
equilibrium, kinetics factor should be considered. The local mobility
of the polymer side chains can be related to the molecular diffusion
based on kinetics. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymers was reported as a key factor governing
the kinetics of PCBM diffusion.54 It was
reported that pristine regioregular P3HT55−57 exhibited a
lower Tg (∼12 °C) compared
to that of PS (∼100 °C),58 whereas
PTB7 did not exhibit a clear glass transition in differential scanning
calorimetry measurements59 and UV–visible
spectroscopy.60 Because Tg of ran-P3HT (−3 to 4 °C) is lower than that
of P3HT,61,62 the difference in Tg may explain the order of PCBM diffusion for at least three
polymers (ran-P3HT > P3HT > PS). The interface free energy and
crystallinity
and the local mobility of the polymer side chains can provide qualitative
guidelines for predicting the diffusion behavior at the interfaces
in PHJs, although it is still not clear which factor is determining
at the room temperature.

Finally, we consider the possible effects
of the PCBM diffusion
in PHJs on the organic electronic devices. A concentration of PCBM
of around 1 wt % corresponds to a molecular density of 6.6 ×
1018 cm–3. Assuming a
uniform distribution of molecules, the average intermolecular distance
was estimated as 5.3 nm. This density is well above the level that
affects the exciton quenching because the exciton diffusion length
of the semiconducting polymers is typically in the range of 2–10
nm. This means that we must be careful about the molecular diffusion
to obtain the exciton diffusion length by using the PHJ structure
and the interfacial quenching model, which may explain the large variation
in calculated exciton length.63 The concentration
of 1 wt % is too low to form interconnected domains for electron transport,
but after the photoinduced electron transfer, the diffused PCBM could
cause charge recombination with the holes in the polymer layer. The
diffused PCBM may exist locally in the less crystalline domains of
the polymer layers. In this case, the effects of the diffused PCBM
could be smaller than those expected from the uniform distribution.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we quantitatively determined the amount of PCBM
in the range of several weight percent to approximately 0.01 wt %
in PHJs with various polymer layers by ToF-SIMS. We found that even
in the combination of the crystallized PCBM and crystalline P3HT,
approximately 1 wt % PCBM diffused into the P3HT layer at room temperature,
which has been overlooked thus far. The lower Tg of the polymers and the higher interface free energy of the
contact may facilitate the diffusion. This study provides important
insight into PHJ structures where the purity of the layers can affect
the interpretation of the measurements and the performance of the
organic optoelectronic devices.

Experimental Section
Materials
ran-P3HT (Mw:
60 000–95 000; Rieke Metals), regioregular P3HT
(lisicon SP001, Merck), PTB7 (1-Material), PS (Mw: 5000, TOSOH), and PC61BM (purity: 99.5%; Solenne)
were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received.

Sample
Preparation
Si/SiO2 (300 nm) substrate
with a mirror surface was cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in
detergent solution, water, 2-propanol, and acetone, followed by UV-O3 treatment. A 10 mg/mL chloroform solution of PC61BM was spin-coated onto Si substrates at 1500 rpm for 30 s to give
an approximately 30 nm thick film. Thermal annealing of the PCBM film
was carried out in a N2-filled glovebox. Aqueous poly(sodium
4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS; 30 mg/mL; Mw: 70 000; Aldrich) was spin-coated onto a precleaned glass
substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. A solution of the polymers (10 mg/mL
in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the glass/PSS substrates at
1000 rpm for 30 s. The glass/PSS/polymer substrate was gently placed
upside down on the Si/SiO2/PC61BM substrate,
and one drop of water was placed on the edge of the two substrates.
Water selectively penetrated into and dissolved the PSS layer, allowing
the polymer layer to be transferred onto the PC61BM layer. Figure S3 shows the CFT method.

Measurements
The primary ion source of ToF-SIMS (TOF.SIMS
5, ION-TOF) was Bi32+ (30 kV), with a 5.5 ns
pulse width. The negative secondary ion from an area of 300 ×
300 μm2 was detected. Sputtering was done with an
Ar gas cluster ion beam with an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV, etching
over an area of 600 × 600 μm2. The median value
of the cluster size was 1400 atoms. The currents of primary ion beam
and Ar gas cluster ion beam were 0.1 pA and 1.2 nA, respectively.
These conditions were optimized to minimize the damage to the organic
materials. The surface of the sample was neutralized during the measurement
electron flood gun. A postacceleration voltage of 10 kV was applied
in front of the detector for improved high mass sensitivity. The water
contact angle was measured with a contact angle meter (DMe-201, KYOWA).
The contact angle was calculated by using the θ/2 method with
a 1.5 μL pure water droplet.
