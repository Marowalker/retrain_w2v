To meet the growing
energy demands, sodium-ion batteries can be
a potential substitute for lithium-ion batteries. Here, we report
the solid-state synthesized alkali Rb- and Cs-modified Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, which adopts hexagonal P63/mmc symmetry. The second
charge/discharge capacity for the as-synthesized Rb- and Cs-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 are
118/114 and 130/125 mA h g–1, which reduces to 62/62
and 77/76 mA h g–1, respectively, after 100 cycles.
In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction data illustrate that a solid
solution reaction occurs for most of the charge/discharge process
in both cases. Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows multiple phases near the charged state,
whereas Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows the formation of a new phase (P2new) at about 2.5 V and multiple phases below 1.7 V. The P2new phase is found to evolve in conjunction with the original P2 phase
until about 1.7 V, where the P2 reflection appears to split into multiple
reflections and a single P2 phase is recovered at 2.7 V on the second
charge. The Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows better energy density in comparison
with the K- and Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 and comparable to the parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2. Ex situ scanning electron
microscopy images show no noticeable change in surface morphology
of the Cs-modified Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, whereas in the case of Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, rods and irregular-shaped
particles are observed after the 100th cycle. The solid-state 23Na NMR shows a distinct shift in the peak position in comparison
with the parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, and two Na environments are observed with no local
disordering in Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 samples. Overall, this article illustrates
the influence of using larger alkali ions to modify P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 and compares this scheme
in terms of phase transitions and electrochemical performance.

Introduction
Over
the last few decades, our technological and economic growth
has increased the overall global energy consumption. To meet future
energy requirements and mitigate the environmental issues caused by
burning fossil fuels, there is an intensive interest to move from
fossil fuels toward renewable energy resources. The use of these energy
sources requires a large-scale energy-storage system (ESS) to store
energy and use it as required, with the aim to achieve an integrated
smart grid.3 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
have become common power sources for the portable electronic market4 because of its high energy density, and these
are already employed in various ESS installations5 around the world. The nonuniform and limited distribution
of Li resources6 has resulted in an increase
in the price of Li and ultimately higher costs of LIBs.7 Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted attention,
particularly in ESS applications because of the wider geographical
distribution of sodium resources and lower perceived cost in comparison
with LIBs.8 SIBs may not surpass the LIB
energy density because of a higher atomic mass (Na 23 g mol–1 and Li is 7 g mol–1) and larger ionic size9 (Na 1.02 and Li 0.76 Å), but the application
of SIBs can be considered in large-scale ESS, where the operational
cost and battery longevity are more important than energy density.10 Notably, some SIB electrode materials show similar
intercalation chemistry to LIB electrodes.7

Conventional-layered sodium transition metal oxides NaxTMO2 (TM = V, Cr, Ti, Mn, Co,
Fe, and
Ni or a mixture of 2–3 of these elements) have been widely
explored for NIBs because of the use of inexpensive transition metals
in some cases and high theoretical capacities.10 The structure features Na ions sandwiched between sheets
of TMO2 layers. Delmas11 notation
of P2, P3, O3, and so forth can be used to describe the structure,
where the letter indicates the Na environment (P is prismatic, and
O is octahedral), and the number indicates the number of layers within
the unit cell. Manganese-rich-layered cathode materials have been
studied for SIBs,12 and the parent P2 NaxMnO2 typically shows low Na diffusion,
poor structural reversibility, and cyclability part of which has been
associated with the Jahn–Teller effect of Mn3+.13 In recent investigations, cation substitutions7,14 on Mn sites appear to be an effective method to improve the structural
stability of P2 NaxMnO2. Magnesium
is electrochemically inactive, and doping on the Mn site in P2 NaxMnO2 appears to minimize phase
transitions during cycling, without significantly affecting the magnitude
of capacity.2,15 Various Mg-doped NaxMnO2 compositions, that is, P2 Na0.67Mn1–xMgxO2, have been reported in the literature.2,16,17 P2 Na2/3Mn0.72Mg0.28O216 has shown
an anomalously high reversible capacity of ∼220 mA h g–1 at a rate of 10 mA g–1 in 1.5–4.4
V, among all of the reported P2 Na0.67Mn1–xMgxO2 compositions.2,16,17

Previously, we reported
on the K-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 and compared its electrochemistry
and structural evolution with P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (K-free).1 Scanning
transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (STEM–EDXS) mapping and X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) K L-edge spectra indicated that K is nonuniformly
distributed in the sample. Overall, the structural evolution of K-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 showed
the combination of solid solution evolution with multiple-phase regions
at the charged and discharged state. In comparison, the parent P2
Na0.67Mn0.8Mg0.2O215 showed a P′2 phase adopting Cmcm symmetry at the discharged state. Here, further exploration of group
1 alkali metals, Rb and Cs, are performed, and their structural-electrochemical
evolution is characterized.

Results
and Discussion
The location and distribution of Cs/Rb in
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 is
likely to be similar to
our previously synthesized K-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2.1 This is
supported by the Rietveld analysis of structural models with X-ray
diffraction (XRD) data of the Rb-modified and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (Figure 1, Table 1, and Table 2). For Rb-modified, the lattice parameters
are a = 2.89098(9) and c = 11.2773(2)
Å which are only 0.8% larger in c lattice parameter
than the parent and the 0.14% larger than the K-modified Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2. For Cs-modified P2
Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, lattice
parameters are a = 2.88938(9) and c = 11.2647(2) Å which are only 0.7% larger in c lattice parameter than the parent and the 0.03% larger than the
K-modified Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2. With the ionic radii9 increasing from
K at 1.38 Å to Rb of 1.52 Å and Cs of 1.67 Å in a sixfold
coordination, a significantly larger expansion in the c lattice is
expected for the partial substitution of significant quantities of
Rb and Cs, especially if they are located on the Na sites. Considering
the fact that Na0.3CoO2 shows a lattice parameter c = 11.197(9) Å and hydration with either the monolayer
or bilayer hydrate, Na0.3CoO2·0.6H2O or Na0.3CoO2·1.2H2O, there is an expansion in the c lattice parameter
by ∼24% (13.83(1)) and ∼76% (19.701(4) Å).18 K0.6CoO219 shows a hexagonal P63/mmc symmetry with the lattice parameters a = 2.838 Å and c = 12.372 Å, whereas hydration
in KxCoO2, for example, K0.3CoO2·0.4H2O, shows an increase
of ∼12% in c lattice parameter (13.8269(6)
Å). A simplified comparison of K0.3CoO2 and Na0.3CoO2 shows an increase in the c lattice parameter by 11% for the K-containing sample,
whereas in our case, Rb and Cs (which are significantly larger than
K) show minimal expansion in the c axis. Considering
the charge and size of Cs and Rb in comparison with the Na, Mn, and
Mg, it is unlikely that Rb or Cs are located on the transition metal
or sodium layers without significant changes to the lattice. This
indicates that the Rb and Cs are unlikely to dope into the structure.
Comparison of weight profile R-factor (wRp) and goodness-of-fit (χ2) assuming
Rb/Cs on the Na sites (Nae or Naf or equally
distributed on both) are shown in Supporting Information Table S1. In all cases, the χ2 and wRp values are higher than the model with no Rb/Cs.

The weak reflection at 2θ
≈ 18.4° marked by (*)
asterisk in Figure 1 and Supporting Information Figure S1
appears to match with Mg6MnO8 in cubic Fm3m symmetry.20 Further weak
reflections at 2θ ≈ 12.5° and ∼25.2°
are likely to be associated with hydrated phases in Rb-modified P2
Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (marked
by # in Figure 1 and Supporting Information Figure S1).17

The 23Na NMR spectra of parent
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 and
alkali metal (K, Rb, and
Cs)-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 are compared in Figure 2. In the present case, the primary contribution of
the large NMR shifts of ∼1000 ppm is due to the paramagnetic
interaction of the Na+ ions with the paramagnetic MnO2 layers.21 Additionally, compared
to the parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (blue-dashed line), the Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 show a distinct shift
in the position of the NMR signal by 37 ppm (red-dashed line) and
33 ppm (green-dashed line), respectively. There is also a noticeable
change in the peak shape relative to the parent. These changes are
a result of subtle changes in the local bonding environment as a result
of Rb and Cs modifications, to which the 23Na NMR is sensitive.
Comparatively, this shift and change in the peak shape are very different
to the previously measured NMR data for K-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, where significant
line-broadening and distinct peak-splitting were observed relative
to the parent sample.1 A detailed line-shape
fitting routine was carried out to determine the number of 23Na environments present in Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, and the fits are presented
in Supporting Information Figure S2. In
the Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 samples, two Na environments are identified
with no local disordering.

XPS (Tables 1 and 2).

Electrochemical
Characterization
Charge/discharge curves of Rb- and Cs-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 at
different current rates and potential cutoffs are shown in Figure 3. The potential profiles
of Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 electrode exhibit relatively smoother slopes in comparison
with the Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 electrode. Some features shown in the potential profile
of Rb-modified sample could be because of sodium carbonate22 or the Rb distribution on the surface. On sodium
extraction during the first charge to 4.2 V at 15 mA g–1, capacities of 27 and 53 mA h g–1 were observed
for Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 samples, respectively, whereas on sodium addition
during first discharge to 1.5 V at 15 mA g–1, capacities
of 115 mA h g–1 and 125 mA h g–1 were observed (Figure 3a,c), respectively. The second charge/discharge capacity for the
Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 were 118/114 and 130/125 mA h g–1, which reduced to 62/62 and 77/76 mA h g–1, respectively,
after 100 cycles. The first charge capacity of the Rb-modified P2
Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 material
is also low in this composition similar to the previously reported
K-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 material.1 Maintaining the same
applied current but reducing the potential window to 2–4 V
(Figure 3b,d), for
Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, the first charge/discharge capacity was 22/88 mA h g–1 and second charge/discharge capacity was 92/86 mA
h g–1, whereas the 100th cycle capacity was 70/69
mA h g–1. For Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, the first charge/discharge
capacity was 60/131 mA h g–1 and the second charge/discharge
capacity was 135/129 mA h g–1, whereas the 100th
cycle capacity was 84/83 mA h g–1. The comparison
of capacity retention of alkali (K, Rb, and Cs)-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 with P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 from 2nd to
100th cycle between the 1.5–4.2 and 2–4 V cutoff windows
is shown in Figure 4. The Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows the best capacity retention in 1.5–4.2
V series (Figure 4a),
suggesting that such modifications maybe beneficial. Whereas in 2–4
V, K-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows the best capacity retention (Figure 4b). The average operating voltage of Rb-
and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 for the first discharge between 1.5 and 4.2 V was 2.28
and 2.52 V, respectively. The energy density with respect to the active
material mass of Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 was 260.95 and 315.42 W h kg–1, respectively. A comparison of the cycling performance of Rb- and
Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 at different current densities (15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 mA
g–1) is shown in Supporting Information Figure S4 in the potential range of 1.5–4.2
V.

P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (green

Ex situ scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) was performed to investigate
the surface morphological change of the electrode material after cycling. Figure 5a,d shows the fresh-electrode
SEM images of Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, respectively, which illustrates irregular-shaped
particles. Figure 5b,e represents the SEM images of Rb- and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 samples, respectively,
after the first cycle (charged 4.2 V and discharged 1.5 V) and Figure 5c,f after 100 cycles.
No noticeable change is observed in surface morphology for Cs-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2,
although in both cases, the electrode after the first cycle appeared
much smoother than the as-prepared electrode and the electrode after
100 cycles. In Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 after 100 cycles, rods can be seen in addition
to the irregular-shaped particles. EDS elemental mapping was recorded
on the rods and irregular-shaped particles, which suggest Na, Mn,
Mg, O, and Rb are distributed all over the sample (as prepared and
cycled) and that the rods after 100 cycles are Rb, Na, and O rich
(elemental mapping images are shown in Supporting Information Figure S5) and are not related to the separator.
The improvement in stability is larger for the K/Rb-modified samples
compared to the Cs-modified sample between 2 and 4 V relative to the
1.5 and 4.2 V.

Phase
Evolution during Cycling
For the initial assessment of phase
evolution during charge/discharge of Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, selected 2θ
ranges are plotted in Figure 6 as a function of time. The Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 cell used for the in
situ XRD experiment showed a capacity of 66 mA h g–1 during first charge, 147 mA h g–1 during first
discharge, and 136 mA h g–1 during second charge,
comparable to the capacity of conventional coin cells at the current
rates employed.

XRD data
highlighting the evolution of the (a) (002) and (b) (100), the potential
profile is also included.

The phase evolution of Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 during charge/discharge/charge
is mostly
a solid solution with some multiple-phase regions. The change in the
(002) and (100) reflection positions (2θ values) with time is
shown in Figure 6a,b,
respectively. A constant change in the diffraction angle 2θ
for the (002) reflection, the stacking axis in these layered systems,
occurs within the solid-state regions. During the first charge, the
(002) 2θ values decrease before reaching a minimum at 140 min
and 3.7 V and then starts to stabilize and subtly increase for the
reminder of charge. The 2θ values of the (100) reflection are
approximately opposite to the (002) reflection (see Figure 6), indicative of an anisotropic
evolution of the lattice parameters occurring during charge and discharge.

During the first charge, the (002) reflection appears to split
into multiple reflections from about 84 min at 3.1 V and the presence
of multiple phases continue on first discharge to 364 min, 2.4 V.
Similarly, splitting of reflections is noted approaching the second
charged state after 2.7 V, 1120 min. These multiple reflections illustrate
that multiple phases are present at the first charged and second charged
states (shown by yellow shaded region in Figure 8). These phases at the charged state are
likely to be similar to each other.

The Rietveld refined fit
to the first in situ synchrotron XRD dataset
of Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 is shown in Figure 7a. Figure 7b shows evidence of the formation of multiple phases in the
region near the charged state with black arrows indicating some of
the other phases present. The first in situ dataset, Rb-modified P2
Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, adopts
hexagonal P63/mmc symmetry
with lattice parameters a = 2.8974(2) and c = 11.205(2) Å. Crystallographic details can be found
in Table 3, and the
fit is shown in Figure 7a. Note that values for the parameters are slightly different to
those obtained from the pure powder because our structural model represented
here is of the material inside a battery, which is in constant contact
with an electrolyte, and thus some Na exchange (Na loss/gain) may
occur.21

are shown as red dots, the calculated Rietveld model as a black line
through the data, and the difference between the data and the model
as the blue line below the data, and pink vertical markers are the
reflection markers of P2 Na0.70Mn0.8Mg0.2O2. Black arrows in (b) represents the presence of other
phases which were hard to model because of the similarity of the peak
positions.

81.46(2) Å3, χ2 = 1.32, wRp = 5.3%, and 26 refinement parameters.

The evolution of the lattice parameters
is shown in Figure 8, where the only refined parameters were
lattice parameters,
background, and profile (type 4, LX). Note that the phases present
in the multiple-phase region (shown in yellow shading) have very similar
lattice parameters and thus are difficult to reliably deconvolute
within the refinements. Thus, a single-phase model approach was chosen.
On the first charge, the a lattice parameter decreases
to 2.8696(3) Å and increases to 2.9131(3) Å at the discharged
state, whereas the c lattice parameter on charge
increases to 11.3101(8) Å just prior to the charged state and
then decreases to 11.1466(5) Å at the discharged state. Discharge
appears to show a decrease in c and increase in volume
and a lattice parameter throughout. Interestingly,
during the second charge, the a lattice parameter
increases to 2.8774(6) Å and then decreases after 952 min, 2.1
V, whereas the c lattice parameter decreases to its
minimum value at 2.1 V of 11.1234(5) Å and increases to 11.2877(7)
Å close to the charged state. The second half of the second charge
mirrors the behavior of the first charge; in other words, charge from
about Na × 0.5–0.7 onward differs from charge when Na
concentrations are higher (from deeper discharged or a more Na-inserted
state) and a similar behavior was observed in P2 Na0.67Mn0.8Mg0.2O2.15

as black and red squares, respectively; volume represented by blue
squares; and the potential profile. A significant multiple phase coexistence
region is indicated with yellow shading.

Overall, the volume decreases to its minimum 80.62(1) Å3 during the first charge and increases to its maximum 81.90(1)
Å3 during discharge and appears to stabilize near
the first charged and first discharged states. The volume remains
fairly stable for second charge and then rapidly decreases. The maximum
change with the single P2 model assumption in volume is 1.28(1) Å3, where Δc is 0.1867(1) Å and
Δa is 0.0435(1) Å.

The Cs-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 cell
used for the in situ XRD experiment, yields a
capacity of 63 mA h g–1 during the first charge,
135 mA h g–1 during the first discharge, and 136
mA h g–1 during the second charge, comparable to
the capacity of conventional coin cells at the current rates employed.
The phase evolution and analysis of Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 are shown in Figures 9–11. During the first charge, the
phase evolution is a single-phase solid solution and the second phase
appears at 420 min, 2.5 V during the first discharge, and continues
past the discharged state up to 980 min, 2.7 V during the second charge,
white arrow in Figure 9a. On the first charge, the (002) reflection decreases in 2θ,
and near the charged state, it increases then on discharge decreasing
marginally before increasing (Figure 9a). The inflexion near the first charged state is more
pronounced compared to second charge. Overall, the (100) reflection
follows the opposite trend, and both the (100) and (002) lose reflection
intensity near the discharged state.

Figure 11 Structural evolution of the Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 electrode during charge/discharge
and the potential profile. For the P2 phase, a and c lattice parameters indicate purple and red squares, respectively,
and volume by blue squares. For the P2new phase, a and c lattice parameters are represented
by black and purple empty squares, respectively, and volume by
green empty squares. The phase fractions for P2 and P2new phases are represented by orange filled and brown empty
squares, respectively. A multiple-phase coexistence region with multiple
P2-like phases is indicated with blue shading and yellow shading exhibits
predominantly two-phase regions of P2 and P2new, and nonshaded
regions indicate predominantly solid-solution reactions. 

Another phase termed “P2new” appears during
the first discharge at 420 min, 2.5 V, and evolves along with the
pre-existing P2 phase. Furthermore, near the discharged state, 756
min, 1.7 V, the (002) reflection appears to split into multiple reflections.
These multiple reflections illustrate that multiple phases are present
near the first discharged state. After 980 min, 2.6 V during the second
charge, the P2new reflection (and other split reflections)
merge back to form the P2 reflection, and this subsequently evolves
as a single phase. Formation of an additional P2-type phase with the
pre-existing P2 phase near the discharged state is also observed in
other Mn-rich layered materials.22

The Rietveld refined fit to the first in situ synchrotron XRD dataset
shows that Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 adopts hexagonal P63/mmc symmetry with lattice parameters a =
2.8939(1) and c = 11.271(2) Å. Crystallographic
details can be found in Table 4, and the fit is shown in Figure 10a. Figure 10b shows evidence of a single-phase electrode at the
charged state. At discharged state, the presence of the P2new phase (green vertical marker) with P2 phase (pink vertical marker)
can be seen in Figure 10c. Additional phases are also clearly present near the P2 phase,
marked by a black arrow in Figure 10c. At the discharged state, the lattice parameters
are a = 2.9238(5), c = 10.942(2)
Å, and volume = 81.01(2) Å3 for the P2-type phase,
whereas for P2new, the lattice parameters are a = 2.9303(7), c = 11.372(3) Å, and volume =
84.57(4) Å3.

The evolution of lattice parameters
of the Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 electrode
during charge/discharge is shown in Figure 11, where the P2 and P2new two-phase
region is shown in yellow shading, and the presence of multiple-phase
region is shown in blue shading. On the first charge, for the P2 model,
the a lattice parameter decreases to its minimum
value 2.8641(1) Å and increases to its maximum value 2.9238(5)
Å at the discharged state with a small inflexion region approximately
half way through the first charge. The c lattice
parameter on the charge increases to its maximum value to 11.3688(4)
Å prior to the charged state and decreases from this value as
it reaches the charged state. It then increases during the initial
discharge and decreases again from about 336 min, 2.9 V for the reminder
of the discharge. During the second charge, the a lattice parameter decreases, whereas the c lattice
parameter increases but again begins to stabilize near the charged
state. The maximum change with the P2 phase in volume is 1.76(1) Å3, where Δc is 0.3918(3) Å and
Δa is 0.0597(4) Å.

Overall, the
volume decreases to its minimum 80.097(6) Å3 during
the first charge and increases to its maximum 81.862(7)
Å3 during discharge, corresponding to the point of
inflexion in the a lattice parameter, then decreases
and appears to stabilize near the discharged state. The stable regions
continue to about 952 min into the second charge and then the evolution
mirrors the first charge. The onset of second phase (P2new) appears from 420 min, 2.5 V during the first discharge and continues
until 980 min, 2.7 V during the second charge and approximately corresponds
to the region where the volume of the pre-existing P2 phase is stable.
For the P2new phase, the change in lattice parameters and
volume is smaller than the P2 phase.

Comparison
with Literature and between Samples
Parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O215 shows the presence of both Cmcm and P63/mmc phases at the discharged
state, especially at low applied currents, whereas the modification
with alkali (K and Rb) in P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 seems to suppress the formation of Cmcm phase during cycling (at the current rates examined).
Furthermore, parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O215 shows a two-phase transition
at approximately half-way through the first discharge similar to that
observed in Cs-modified Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2. However, in Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, the pre-existing P2 phase
and the P2new phase continue to evolve during discharge
unlike the parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2,15 where the original phase
transforms into the new P2 phase.

The Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows the
formation of a new P2 phase, the original P2 phase, and splitting
of the original P2 phase near the discharged state (Figures 9 and 10). In comparison, Rb-modified Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows the presence of multiple phases at the
charged state only and single phase at the discharged state. Whereas
K-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O21 shows multiple phases at the
charged state and subtle two-phase reaction at the discharged state.
Essentially, each modification results in subtly different phase evolution.

On the basis of the electrochemical analysis and comparison, parent
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows
higher capacity but Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows marginally better capacity retention
in comparison with the parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 and other alkali (K, Rb)-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (Figure 4a) in 1.5–4.2
V. It is likely that the differences in phase evolution, subtle differences
in sodium local environment (Figure 11), result in the differences in the electrochemistry.
Interestingly, the Cs-modified shows the maximum change using the
single P2 phase assumption in volume, that is, 1.76(1) Å3, in comparison with that of Rb-modified of 1.28(1) Å3 and K-modified of 1.321(1) Å3, whereas the
change in c lattice parameter of K- and Cs-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 is
∼2 times larger compared to Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2. Rb/Cs-modified P2
Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 also
contain a weak reflection at 2θ ≈ 18.4° in the XRD
data, whereas no such peak was observed in K-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 sample.

In the
2–4 V window, all samples show better capacity retention
than in the 1.5–4.2 V window. The Rb- and K-modified show better
retention than the Cs-modified and parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2.

Conclusions
The
Cs-modified and Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 synthesized by a conventional solid-state
reaction are used as a cathode material for SIBs. The Cs-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (315.42
W h kg–1) shows better energy density in comparison
with the K-modified (254.19 W h kg–1) and Rb-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (260.95
W h kg–1) and is comparable to the parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 (356.72 W
h kg–1). The Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 also shows better capacity
retention in comparison with the parent P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 and other alkali (K, Rb)-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 in
1.5–4.2 V (Figure 4a). Overall, all of the materials show better capacity retention
in reduced voltage window suggesting that a shorter voltage range
is beneficial for the long-term performance of battery (Figure 4). The solid-state 23Na NMR shows two Na environments with no local disordering in Rb-
and Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 samples. SEM images illustrate that Rb/Cs-modified
P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 are
composed of irregular-structured plates. The Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows the
presence of multiple phases only near the charged state and the initial
parts of the first discharge, whereas Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 shows a single-phase
evolution at the charged state. However, a more complex phase evolution
is found near the discharged state; from 2.5 V, a second phase (P2new) appears and continues to 2.7 V on the second charge; further,
the P2 phase splits into multiple reflections near the discharged
state.

The variation in the electrochemical performance and
different
structural evolution clearly indicates that the Rb and Cs additions
perturb both electrochemistry and structural evolution. In particular,
the R -modification appears to suppress phase transitions at low potentials,
whereas the Cs modification suppresses phase transitions at higher
potentials. This work sets up the groundwork to understand these perturbations.

Experimental
Section
Rb/Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 of target composition “Na0.7Rb0.1Mn0.8Mg0.2O2” and
“Na0.7Cs0.1Mn0.8Mg0.2O2” were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction.
Stoichiometric amounts of Cs2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich,
99.9%), Rb2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%), Na2CO3 (Analytical Univar, 99.8%), MnCO3 (Laboratory BDH), and MgO (Analytical AnalaR, >99%) were ground
and heated at 900 °C for 12 h in air and quenched to room temperature
and immediately transferred to an Ar-filled glovebox.

Laboratory
XRD patterns were collected on a PANalytical X’Pert
Pro Multipurpose Powder Diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation
between 5 ≤ 2θ ≤ 90° in 0.001° steps.
SEM (Hitachi S3400-N) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer
(EDS, Bruker SDD XFlash model 5010) and running the Bruker ESPRIT
1.9 software23 were used to understand
surface morphology and composition. Samples were mounted on a double-sided
carbon tape (uncoated). To perform the ex situ SEM, active material
electrodes were obtained from coin cells after cycling to the charged
4.2 V and/or discharged 1.5 V states. The electrodes were extracted
from the coin cells in the Ar-filled glovebox, washed with dimethyl
carbonate (DMC), and dried for 3 days inside the glovebox. After 3
days, the active material was scratched from the electrode foil and
mounted on the double-sided carbon tape inside the glovebox.

23Na solid-state NMR measurements on the fresh cathode
material were carried out on a Bruker AVANCE III 300 MHz instrument,
with a wide bore 7 T superconducting magnet operating at a frequency
of 79 MHz for the 23Na nucleus. The samples were packed
into 2.5 mm zirconia rotors fitted with Vespel caps in an Ar-filled
glovebox and spun to 30 kHz at the magic angle. The spectra were acquired
using a Hahn echo sequence and a hard 90° pulse optimized to
1.5 μs to ensure the broadband excitation. Upto 1452k signal
transients, at a recycle delay of 10 ms were signal averaged to ensure
sufficient signal to noise ratio. The spectra were referenced to the 23Na NMR signal of solid NaCl set to 0 ppm. The spectra were
deconvoluted using the DmFIT program.24,26

The electrode preparation was undertaken inside an Ar-filled
glovebox.
The active material was combined with a conductive agent (carbon black,
IMERYS C65) and binder (polyvinylidene fluoride, MTI corporation)
in the 80:10:10 weight ratio. N-Methyl pyrrolidone
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added dropwise to the powder and stirred overnight
to form a viscous slurry. The slurry was cast using a notch bar of
height ∼200 μm on an aluminum foil current collector,
dried overnight, and pressed using a flat-plate mechanical press at
100 kN (MTI Corporation). The mass loadings for the active material
on electrode were 3.0 ± 0.5 mg. Research coin cells (CR 2032)
were assembled using the active material electrode, 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate and propyl carbonate (EC/PC, 1:1 vol
%) electrolyte solution on a glass fiber separator, and a sodium metal
electrode (∼1 mm thickness). The coin cells were then galvanostatically
charged/discharged to characterize their electrochemical performance
in the two different voltage ranges of 1.5–4.2 and 2–4
V on a Neware battery tester. Various cycling tests were used at room
temperature, for example, long-term cycling (up to 100 cycles) at
15 mA h g–1 or rate capability with current densities
ranging from 15 to 90 mA g–1.

In situ half-coin
cells contained 3 mm diameter holes in the casing
and 5 mm diameter holes in the stainless spacer for in situ XRD measurements.
The coin cells contained Na metal (∼1 mm thickness), 1 M NaClO4 in EC/PC (1:1 vol %) electrolyte solution on a glass fiber,
and thicker (∼300 μm)-casted electrode material. Cells
were made 1–2 days before the in situ synchrotron XRD experiments.
Further details regarding the coin-cell construction and beamline
setup can be found in our previous publications.15,27−29 In situ synchrotron
XRD data were collected on the Powder Diffraction Beamline30 at the Australian
Synchrotron
with an X-ray wavelength λ = 0.59082(6) Å for Rb-modified
and λ = 0.68804(3) Å for Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2. The wavelength was
determined by refining a structural model against data from the NIST
660b LaB6 standard reference material. Each data set was
collected for 3.5 min (with a detector position movement) every 28
min on the coin cell in transmission geometry throughout the charge/discharge
cycles. The Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 active electrode material mass was 3.44 mg;
and the cell was charged at 15 mA g–1 to 4.2 V,
discharged to 1.5 V, and charged again to 4.2 V during the experiment.
The Rb-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2 active electrode material mass was 3.6 mg; and the
cell was charged at 20 mA g–1 to 4.2 V, discharged
at 15 mA g–1 to 1.5 V, and charged again at 15 mA
g–1 to 4.2 V during the experiment.

Rietveld
refinements were performed with GSAS32-EXPGUI31 and GSAS-II.33 For ex situ
data of the powders and initial in situ synchrotron
XRD data, the lattice, background, profile, and selected atomic parameters
were refined. For sequential refinements of the in situ data, the
refined parameters for both samples were the lattice parameters, profile,
and background, whereas for Cs-modified P2 Na0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O2, phase fractions of the phases
identified were refined from 420 min, 2.5 V (first discharge) until
980 min, 2.7 V (second charge).32,33
