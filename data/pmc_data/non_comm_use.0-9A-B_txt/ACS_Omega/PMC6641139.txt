Sodium lignosulfonate (SLS) was aminated
to obtain a lignin amine
(LA) compound, which was subsequently crosslinked with poly(ethylene
glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) to obtain hydrogels. The chemical
structure of the resulting LA-derived hydrogel (LAH) was characterized
by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis, and the interior
morphology of the freeze-dried hydrogel was examined by scanning electron
microscopy. NMR and FTIR spectroscopy results indicated that the amino
groups of LA reacted with PEGDGE in the crosslinking reaction. The
lignin content in the resulting hydrogel increased with an increase
in the LA/PEGDGE weight ratio in the reaction, approaching a maximum
(∼71 wt %) and leveling off. The hydrogel with such a composition
happened to be the same as the one prepared by reacting the primary
amines of LA and epoxy groups of PEGDGE in equal stoichiometry. These
results strongly suggest that the formation of the hydrogel network
structure was largely dictated by the reactions between the primary
amines and epoxy groups. The gels with lignin contents at this level
exhibited a superior swelling capacity, viscoelasticity, and shear
properties.

Introduction
Sodium lignosulfonate
(SLS) is an inexpensive byproduct obtained from sulfite pulping manufacturing.
Because SLS contains many sulfonate salt groups, it is a water-soluble
polymer. Lignosulfonate has been used as a low-cost surfactant and
dispersant in some applications, such as concrete admixtures,1,2 coal slurry in water,3 and dyestuff.4 Owing to its renewable and water-soluble characteristics,
in recent years lignosulfonate has also been widely investigated for
the preparation of hydrogel products.5−8

Nowadays, the market of hydrogel products
is growing rapidly. Depending
on their chemical structures and properties, hydrogels are used for
many different applications. Most hydrogels are used in hygiene products9 and only a small proportion is used for applications
such as contact lenses,10 tissue engineering
scaffolds,11 drug-delivery systems,12 and wound dressings.13 Recently, there is a growing interest in using lignin-based aerogels
and carbon aerogels for advanced applications, such as energy storage,14 environmental remediation,15 etc. Nonetheless, except for some starch- and protein-based
hydrogel products, which have only found certain niche applications,16,17 current commercially available hydrogel products are almost entirely
made from petrochemical feedstock, especially from acrylic acid and
acrylamide monomers.18 In recent years, hydrogels
based on natural polymers, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, have
also received considerable attention.19

However, there are only a few reports on lignosulfonate-derived
hydrogels in the literature. In those studies, hydrogels based on
lignosulfonate or modified lignosulfonate feedstocks are mainly prepared
through self-crosslinking or crosslinking with other polymers.20 For example, in one study xanthan and lignosulfonate
were crosslinked with epichlorohydrin to form a xanthan–lignosulfonate
hydrogel. However, the yield of the hydrogels decreased from 87 to
48% with an increase in the lignosulfonate content from 5 to 40 wt
%.5 In another study, the dichromate ion
was found to be an efficient crosslinking agent for gel formation
and the gels made from solutions with SLS contents varying from 5
to 30 wt % exhibited an elastic modulus ranging from 1 to 40 kPa.6 Although the elastic modulus of the gel was improved
by this method, the use of a chromium salt could cause significant
environmental pollution. Wu et al. graft-copolymerized magnesium lignosulfonate
with acrylic acid and acrylamide using potassium persulfate as an
initiator and N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide
as a crosslinker to obtain a superabsorbent hydrogel.7 The swelling capacity of the gel decreased with increasing
lignin content in the gel, indicating that the swelling capacity was
mainly determined by the acrylic acid and acrylamide contents. In another
study, a hydrogel was prepared by the reaction between an oligo(oxyethylene)-grafted
SLS and poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE), but the swelling
capacity of the obtained gel was only 8.1 g/g.8 So far, lignosulfonate-based hydrogels with a high swelling capacity
have only been obtained via graft copolymerization with acrylic acid
or acrylamide, and the swelling capacity generally decreases with
increasing lignin content in the hydrogel. However, those lignin-based
hydrogels from all of the above preparation methods have a low lignin
content. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method for the
synthesis of lignin-based hydrogels with a high lignin content.

In this work, a new lignin-based hydrogel was prepared from lignin
amine (LA) and PEGDGE. LA was prepared via the Mannich reaction by
reacting SLS with formaldehyde and diethylenetriamine (DETA). In the
literature, LA has often been prepared by the Mannich reaction and
used as flocculants, precipitants, asphalt emulsifiers, oil well cement
additives, and cationic dispersants.21−23 Because amine groups
usually have a much higher reactivity than hydroxyl groups in reacting
with epoxy groups, the aminated lignin derivatives are expected to
react with PEGDGE more effectively than SLS itself, resulting in hydrogel
products with higher gel contents. To the best of our knowledge, the
use of LA for hydrogel preparation has not been reported elsewhere.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterizations of LA
According to
previous studies in the literature,5,8 the hydroxyl
groups in SLS are not reactive enough for a crosslinking reaction
to achieve hydrogels with a high lignin content and good swelling
capacity. To improve the reactivity, lignosulfonate was modified through
the introduction of amino groups into its molecular structure in this
study. The Mannich reaction is a frequently used method for introducing
alkyl amino groups to the aromatic ring of lignin.24Scheme 1 gives a schematic illustration of the reaction and the possible
structure of the formed LA. In this work, DETA was used as an amination
agent, which has two primary amino groups in its structure. The LA
structure shown in Scheme 1 is one of many possible structures formed and has the maximum
primary amino groups. The resulting LA with a high primary amino content
could greatly enhance the efficiency of high hydrogel formation.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Structure of a Possible LA Product
Prepared Using the Mannich Reaction
Figure 1 shows a
comparison of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra between SLS
and LA. The spectra display both typical and specific characteristics
for each lignin sample.25,26 With the peak of benzene
skeleton vibrations, at 1509 cm–1, as the reference
peak, the peak area ratios of A3415 to A1509 increased from 0.04 for SLS to 1.88 for
LA. This was due to the contributions of the introduced amino groups
in LA (see Figure 1).27 Moreover, the peak of aromatic C–H
stretching vibrations, at ∼817 cm–1, for
LA became much wider compared to that for SLS, indicating that the
substitution reaction occurred on the benzene ring of lignin via the
Mannich reaction.24Table 1 shows the elemental compositions of SLS
and LA. The nitrogen content increased from 0.07% for SLS to 6.49%
for LA. Moreover, the amount
of primary amine groups in LA was found to be 1.67 mmol/g. All of
the results also indicate that amine groups were successfully introduced
into the lignin structure.

Synthesis and Characterizations
of Lignin Amine Hydrogel (LAH)
Scheme 2 illustrates
the likely chemical reactions involved in the formation of a hydrogel
network structure from LA and PEGDGE. It is known that the
primary amino groups can easily open the epoxy ring through nucleophilic
substitution. As the reaction proceeded, the multifunctional LA and
difunctional PEGDGE quickly formed an infinite polymer network. The
amino groups introduced into lignin are believed to be much more reactive
toward the epoxy groups of PEGDGE than the original hydroxyl groups
in lignin.

of LA and PEGDGE
FTIR Spectra
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the FTIR spectra of PEGDGE,
LA, and LAH. There are some clear differences in the whole range of
wavenumbers. The appearance of two new bands in LAH at 1114 and 951
cm–1, which were attributed to the C–O–C
stretching vibration, clearly indicated the presence of PEGDGE segments
in the hydrogel.27 The inclusion of the
PEGDGE moiety in the hydrogel was also supported by increases in the
absorbance of the bands between 2850 and 2910 cm–1, which originated from the C–H stretching of methylene in
PEGDGE. Furthermore, new bands at 1353 and 848 cm–1, corresponding to the C–H bending vibration, and at 1252
cm–1, corresponding to the C–C stretching
vibration, were also observed in the LAH hydrogel. By comparing the
spectra of LA and LAH, it is noted that the absorbance at ∼3400
cm–1, which was attributed to the stretching vibration
of the hydroxyl groups and amino groups, showed little change. This
is because the crosslinking reaction between the amino group of LA
and epoxy group of PEGDGE also resulted in the formation of a new
hydroxyl group; therefore, the intensity of the peak at 3400 cm–1 for LA and LAH did not change obviously.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra
of PEGDGE, LA, and LAH (LA% = 69.6%).

Solid-State 13C NMR
Solid-state 13C NMR is widely used for investigating the composition of the hydrogel
network. In this work, it was also used for analysis of the chemical
structures of LA and LAH. In Figure 3, it can be seen that all characteristic peaks in the
spectrum of LA were retained in the spectrum of the gel (LAH). For
example, the signals between 146.8 and 163.2 ppm were attributed to
the C3 and C4 of the guaiacyl units and C3 and C5 of the syringyl
units in the lignin structure. Carbons at positions 1, 2, 4, 5, and
6 of the guaiacyl unit and other phenolic units (like 5-5, β-5,
etc.) were noted in the peaks at 108.0–146.8 ppm. The peaks
between 53.6 and 67.2 ppm were mainly attributed to the carbons of
methoxy groups.28,29 However, a strong peak at 75.7
ppm is noted in the spectrum of LAH and is believed to be due to the
presence of the PEGDGE moiety in the hydrogel structure. After PEGDGE
was crosslinked with LA, the peak attributed to the methylene group
(carbon c, Figure 3) in PEGDGE was shifted from 69.5 to 75.7 ppm. The broadening of
this peak in the hydrogel resulted from the complex environment surrounding
those newly formed bonds in the structure of the lignin hydrogel.
This result indicates that the crosslinking reaction effectively took
place between LA and PEGDGE.

Figure 3 Solid 13C NMR spectra of PEGDGE,
LA, and LAH (LA% =
69.6%).

Hydrogel Composition
Difunctional PEGDGE played the
role of a crosslinker, whereas multifunctional LA served as both a
building block and a branching unit in the formation of a hydrogel
network structure. The number average molecular weight of PEGDGE is
500 g/mol, which corresponds to an equivalent epoxy weight of 4 mmol/g,
whereas the primary amine content of LA is 1.67 mmol/g. When the crosslinking
reaction proceeded
by a stoichiometry of 1 M primary amine reacting with 1 M epoxy under
the experiment conditions, the equivalent weight ratio of LA/PEGDGE
was ∼2.4/1 (w/w). Consequently, the resulting hydrogel would
assume a composition containing ∼71 wt % lignin. Figure 4 shows that
the conversion of LA in the crosslinking reaction slowly decreased
with an increase in the LA/PEGDGE weight ratio from 1.5/1 to 2.5/1,
and there was a sharp drop on further increasing the LA/PEGDGE ratio.
On the other hand, the gel
content remained almost unchanged with an increase in the LA/PEGDGE
weight ratio to 2.5/1, which also similarly exhibited a rapid decrease
with further increase in the LA/PEGDGE ratio.

Figure 4 Conversion of LA and
gel content at different initial LA/PEGDGE
weight ratios.

When LA was in stoichiometric
deficit (LA/PEGDGE = 1.5/1 to 2.5/1
w/w), it mostly reacted as indicated by the high LA conversion (Figure 4). Meanwhile, the
resulting hydrogels exhibited a high level of gel content. In the
case of LA in deficit, the higher than stoichiometric amounts (with
respect to those of the primary amines) of the PEG moiety (Figure 5) in the resulting
gels suggest that PEGDGE also reacted with other functional groups
in addition to amino groups in LA. It is understood that both the
primary amines and phenolic hydroxyl groups in LA can react with the
epoxy groups of PEGDGE, but the primary amine groups have a higher
reactivity.

Figure 5 LA content in LAH at different initial LA/PEGDGE weight ratios.

When the LA/PEGDGE weight ratio
was 2.5/1 (w/w), which was around
the equivalent weight ratio (∼2.4/1 w/w), besides showing a
high conversion and gel content, the resulting gel exhibited a composition
(69.6 wt % lignin) similar to that anticipated for the gel prepared
by reaction of a primary amine and epoxy by stoichiometry (Figure 4). This result suggests
that the reaction between the primary amines of LA and epoxy groups
of PEGDGE proceeded to better completion. However, when LA in the
reaction became increasingly excessive (LA/PEGDGE weight ratio >2.5/1),
that is, the crosslinker was in greater deficit, the LA conversion
and gel content of the resulting gels precipitated quickly (Figure 4). Nonetheless, in
this case, the lignin contents in the resulting gels remained relatively
unchanged (Figure 5). This evidence further supports the fact that the crosslinking
reaction occurred mainly between the primary amines and epoxy groups.

In Figure 5, the
LA content in the final product, LAH, increased from 63.2 to 69.6%
with an increase in the LA/PEGDGE weight ratio from 1.5/1 to 2.5/1
in the crosslinking reaction; it then started leveling off at higher
ratios. Again, this result suggests that beyond the stoichiometric
amount excessive LA was largely not incorporated into the network
structure. The highest LA content that could be achieved for the hydrogel
in this study was around 71 wt %, which is almost identical to the
composition of the hydrogel in which all primary amine groups were
reacted with the epoxy group of PEGDGE in a 1:1 ratio.

Swelling
and Interior Morphology of the Freeze-Dried Hydrogel
Figure 6 shows the
swelling capacities of hydrogels with different LA contents. All hydrogels
exhibited a significantly higher swelling capacity than that of similar
SLS-derived hydrogels reported in the literature,8 suggesting that our preparation method of lignin-based
hydrogels using LA could greatly improve the ability of water absorption.
It is interesting to note that the swelling capacity of LAH increased
continuously from 31 to 42 g/g with an increase in the LA content
in the gel from ∼63 to ∼71 wt % (Figure 6) and then quickly leveled off with further
increase in the LA content of the hydrogel. It is interesting to note
that the gels containing higher PEG contents (or PEG-rich) in their
structures exhibited lower swelling capacities. In contrast, gels
with a composition similar to that anticipated by the stoichiometric
reaction of primary amine/epoxy displayed the maximum swelling. This
result suggests that for those PEG-rich gels some of the PEG chains
were probably not effectively built into the network structure, that
is, they were the dangling chains. The rheological properties shown
below provided further support for this argument.

Figure 6 Swelling capacity of
LAHs with different LA content in hydrogels.

Figure 7 shows
the
interior morphological structures of freeze-dried LAHs with different
LA contents. The honeycomb-like morphological structure of the freeze-dried
hydrogel is a consequence of phase separation of water and the crosslinked
polymer in the swollen hydrogel during drying, and the pore size is
influenced by the chemical composition, crosslinking, and drying conditions.
It was noted that the pore size of the xerogel increased with LA content
in the hydrogel. The rigid aromatic LA building block might exhibit
a higher tendency to aggregate with the evaporation of water during
freeze-drying. Consequently, the swollen hydrogel with a higher LA
content tended to phase-separate faster during drying, resulting in
a coarse (large pore size) phase structure.

(SEM) micrographs of LAHs with different
LA contents (a, LA% = 63.2%; b, LA% = 66.9%; c, LA% = 69.6%; d, LA%
= 71.1%; e, LA% = 72.7%).

Rheological Properties
The hydrogel specimens for rheological
tests were prepared by transferring 1 mL of the reaction mixture into
a disk-shaped mold and letting the gel form in the mold. The samples
without extraction were used directly for rheological testing. The
LAH gels exhibited typical viscoelastic behavior, as both the storage
modulus (G′; Figure 8a) and loss modulus (G″; Figure 8b) increased with
oscillating frequency. G′ was larger than G″ over the whole range of frequencies, suggesting
a general dominance of the elastic response of the gels to deformation
over a broad time scale. It was noted that
both G′ and G″ increased
with an increase in the LA content of the LAH hydrogels, which was
probably due to the improvement in the network structure of these
samples and the more rigid molecular structure of the lignin moiety
in the hydrogel network structure. Figure 8c shows the shear stress versus shear strain
curves of LAHs with different LA contents. Whereas all hydrogel samples
demonstrated similar strains at failure (∼60%), they exhibited
very different moduli and strengths, both of which increased rapidly
with an increase in the LA content of the gel. The inferior viscoelastic
performance and shear mechanical properties for those PEG-rich hydrogels
were likely due to the existence of network defects, like dangling
PEG chains, as aforementioned. In addition, the rigid LA building
block tended to render the hydrogel the superior mechanical performance.

modulus (G″, 1% strain) (b), and stress–strain

test specimens contained 71.4% water.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All chemical reagents were commercially
available. SLS (Mw = 4000–100 000
g/mol, sulfonate salt content = 1.25–2.5 mequiv/g) was purchased
from Borregaard Ligno Tech USA Inc. (Houston) and used as received.
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from Macron Fine Chemicals,
DETA (99.5% solution) from Acros Organics, formaldehyde (HCHO, 37%
solution) from Fisher Scientific, hydrochloride acid (HCl, 36.8% solution)
from EMD Millipore, and propanol and PEGDGE (Mn = 500 g/mol, density at 25 °C = 1.14 g/mL) from Sigma-Aldrich.

Preparation of LA
The preparation of LA followed a
method reported in the literature.22 10
g of SLS (OH value = 2.9 mmol/g) was first dissolved in 100 mL of
distilled water in a three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser
and a thermometer, and then, 15 g of DETA was added dropwise under
stirring at room temperature. The pH of the solution mixture was adjusted
to 10–10.5 using a 0.1 M NaOH solution and 0.1 M HCl solution.
Next, 10 g of formaldehyde solution (37%) was added dropwise under
stirring at room temperature. The temperature was raised to 50 °C
and the reaction was continued for 4 h. Finally, the solution was
poured into 500 mL of propanol to precipitate the LA. After the dark
brown LA was collected by filtration and washed with propanol three
times, the solid product was dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C
until a constant weight was reached. Primary, second, and tertiary
amine groups are all likely present in the structure of the resulting
LA. The primary amine is believed to be the most reactive form in
the crosslinking reaction with the epoxy group of PEGDGE. The primary
amine value of LA was determined according to the ASTM D 2074-92 and
ASTM D 2074-92 methods, which are based on the formation of a Schiff
base from the reaction of a primary amine and aldehyde. Salicylaldehyde
was used the aldehyde reagent, and the primary amine content was determined
by comparing the hydrochloride titration results before and after
the reaction. The primary amine value was found to be 1.67 mmol/g.

Preparation of LAH
First, a predetermined amount of
LA was dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water at 85 °C for 2 h
under stirring. Next, to this LA solution was added PEGDGE (1 g) while
stirring, and then the magnetic stirring was stopped. The hydrogel
was formed in about 5 min. After the hydrogel was extracted thoroughly
with warm and cold water until neither lignin nor PEGDGE was detected
in the washing water by UV spectroscopy, the sample was freeze-dried.

Characterization and Tests
The content of LA in the
hydrogels and its conversion efficiency were calculated using the
following equations (eqs 1 and 2) 1   2  where LA% is
the content of LA in the final
hydrogel after the crosslinking reaction; Y is the
conversion efficiency of LA after the crosslinking reaction; mi is the initial amount of LA added in the crosslinking
reaction; mw is the amount of LA in the
washing water; and mx is the weight of
the xerogel after freeze-drying.

A UV spectrometer was used
to measure the residual LA in the washing water due to its characteristic
absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm. At low concentrations, SLS is
completely dissolved in the solution, so the UV absorbance increases
linearly with an increase in the lignin mass concentration. A standard
curve of the absorbance intensity at 280 nm versus SLS concentration
was first established and then used for calculation of the mass of
the residual SLS in the extraction water.23

The gel content was calculated using eq 3 3  where X is the
gel content
of LAH; ma is the weight of the xerogel
after washing; and mb is the weight of
the xerogel before washing.

FTIR Spectroscopy and Elemental Analysis
All samples
were freeze-dried for 24 h prior to FTIR spectroscopy, solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and SEM measurements.
FTIR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet Nexus 670 Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer using the ATR mode of measurement. The samples
were scanned 32 times in the range of 4000–650 cm–1. Element analysis was performed using a LECO CHN Analyzer according
to the method of ASTM D5291.

SEM
After the
hydrogel samples were swollen in distilled
water at room temperature for 24 h, they were frozen in liquid nitrogen
and then cut immediately into smaller samples with flat surfaces,
followed by freeze-drying. Prior to the SEM experiment, the surface
(cross-section) of the hydrogel was sputter-coated with gold. SEM
examination was performed on an FEI Quanta 200F apparatus, with an
accelerating voltage of 20 kV.

13C NMR
Solid-state 13C NMR analysis
for LA and LAH was performed on a Varian Inova 500 MHz NMR spectroscope
equipped with a Nalorac H{CPN} Quad Resonance probe with XYZ-axis PFG. The 13C NMR spectrum of PEGDGE in D2O was recorded using a Varian VNMRS 600 instrument.

Swelling
Capacity of Hydrogels
A known weight of the
xerogel placed in a tea bag was immersed in distilled water. After
the sample was fully swollen without any stress at room temperature,
the tea bag was removed from the water and the swollen hydrogel was
filtered through a sintered-glass funnel to remove excess water. The
swelling capacity of the hydrogel is calculated using eq 4 4  where Ws and Wd represent the weights
of the swollen and dry
hydrogel (xerogel), respectively.

Rheological Measurement
The rheological properties
of the LAHs were measured using a Discovery HR-2 rheometer (TA instruments).
A parallel-plate geometry with a diameter of 25 mm was used, and the
testing gap was set at 2.0 mm. The angular frequency was scanned from
0.1 to 450 rad/s at 25 °C. The hydrogel test specimens were prepared
by transferring aliquots of the reactant solution into a mold with
disk-shaped cavities and letting the gel form in the mold at 85 °C.
The disk-shaped cavities had the same diameter (25 mm)
as that of the parallel plate and a thickness of 2 mm.

Conclusions
A new preparation method for lignin-based hydrogels was successfully
introduced in this study. SLS was converted into an LA compound, which
was then crosslinked using poly(ethylene) glycol diglycidyl ether
to give hydrogels. Compared with the hydrogel counterparts prepared
from unmodified lignosulfonate in the literature, the hydrogels in
this study exhibited clearly higher conversions of lignin and gel
contents. This was because the amine groups introduced, especially
the primary amine groups, had a higher reactivity than the phenolic
hydroxyl groups in the crosslinking reaction with the epoxy groups;
consequently, the reaction efficiency for hydrogel preparation was
greatly improved. Our LAHs also exhibited a higher swelling capacity
than other similar lignin-based hydrogels in the literature. The lignin
content in the resulting
hydrogel increased with an increase in the LA/PEGDGE weight ratio
in the reaction until it reached a maximum (∼71 wt %); it then
leveled off with further increase in the LA/PEGDGE ratio. It is noted
that the maximum achievable lignin content in the hydrogel corresponded
fairly well to the composition predicted by the stoichiometric reaction
between the primary amines of LA and epoxy groups of PEGDGE in a 1:1
molar ratio. This result strongly suggests that formation of the hydrogel
network structure was largely dictated by the reactions between the
primary amines and epoxy groups. On the other hand, those gels with
lignin contents lower than the maximum indicate that other functional
groups in LA could also participate in the reaction process when primary
amines are insufficient. However, the low swelling and rheological
properties for those gels suggest the existence of network defects,
probably some dangling PEG chains. Nonetheless, all gels with a similar
lignin content as that predicted by the stoichiometric reaction between
primary amines and epoxy groups exhibited superior swelling capacity,
viscoelasticity, and shear properties, suggesting improvement of the
network structures in these gels. The results from this study suggest
that converting lignosulfonate to the more reactive LA and subsequently
crosslinking it with a diglycidyl ether compound is a good method
for the preparation of lignin-based hydrogels with an improved performance.
