Developing new molecular ligands
for the direct detection and tracking
of amyloid protein aggregates is key to understanding and defeating
myriad neurodegenerative and other disorders including Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s diseases. A crucial factor in the performance
of an amyloid dye is its ability to detect the amyloid structural
motif independent of the sequence of the amyloid-forming protomer.
The current study investigates structure–function relationships
of a class of novel phenyleneethynylene (PPE)-based dyes and fluorescent
polymers using amyloid fibrils formed by two model proteins: lysozyme
and insulin. A small library of 18 PPE compounds that vary in molecular
weights, charge densities, water solubilities, and types and geometries
of functional groups was tested. One compound, the small anionic oligo(p-phenylene ethynylene) electrolyte OPE1, was identified
as a selective sensor for the amyloid conformation of both lysozyme
and insulin. On the basis of protein binding and photophysical changes
observed in the dye from this set of PPE compounds, keys to the selective
detection of the amyloid protein conformation include moderate size,
negative charge, and substituents that provide high microenvironment
sensitivity to the fluorescence yield. These principles can serve
as a guide for the further refinement of the effective amyloid-sensing
molecules.

==== Body
Introduction
The function of a protein
in living cells depends on the folding
and stabilization of a native structure or set of conformers. Misassembly
of proteins into β-sheet-enriched fibrillar aggregates is a
hallmark of protein misfolding disorders such as, among many others,
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease.1−6 Amyloid protein aggregation is a complex and heterogeneous process
that begins with protomeric proteins that differ widely in sequence,
structure, size, and function and ends with highly ordered fibrils
that accumulate in the affected tissues.7,8 In AD, protein
aggregation is believed to initiate a cascade of events culminating
in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline decades before the onset
of clinical symptoms,6,7 protein aggregates are thus ideal
biomarkers for early disease detection and therapeutic intervention.

Many studies have been launched to develop probes for detecting
the aggregated conformation of disease-associated proteins, and conformation-
and sequence-specific antibodies have been developed for protein aggregates.9 However, the myriad of challenges associated
with antibody-based detection and failures of a number of clinical
trials10,11 have spurred renewed efforts in developing
small-molecule probes. Several amyloid plaque-specific positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging probes have been reported,12−15 including [11C] Pittsburgh
compound B, [18F] florbetapir, and [18F] flutemetamol.
Although these compounds are capable of detecting fibrillar aggregates
of the amyloid-β protein (Aβ) that constitute the amyloid
plaques in the brain, they are of limited clinical use. These probes
are insensitive toward neurofibrillary tangles composed of fibrillar
aggregates of the tau protein, undermining their diagnostic value
as AD entails a complex regional localization of both Aβ and
tau deposits.16,17

The shortcomings of existing
PET probes partly stem from the molecular
scaffolds from which they are derived, primarily the 2-phenylbenzothiazole
dye thioflavin T (or the mixture of related dyes “thioflavin
S”), commonly used for the histologic detection of amyloid.
All amyloid-binding agents share a common rigid or semiflexible “conjugated
rod” motif, which allows them to favorably bind to the hydrophobic
surface grooves on amyloid fibrils.18 When
used for fluorescence imaging, these ligands primarily function on
a “molecular rotor” basis, in which fluorescence shift
or enhancement occurs because of planarization of the conjugated region
and prevention of fast nonradiative decay by intramolecular rotation.19,20 New sensors based on different scaffolds with improved sensing capabilities
are thus urgently needed to unravel the underlying pathogenesis of
amyloid-related diseases. While radiopharmaceutical tracers have the
advantage in the preclinical and clinical setting, optical sensors
are uniquely suited to broad adoption because of the wide availability
of instrumentation for imaging and spectroscopy.21,22 Along with high sensitivity for the aggregated protein conformation
and a large increase in brightness upon binding, the critically important
property of a sensor is its ability to detect the aggregates formed
from a wide set of promoter proteins.

Recently,23 we have reported the use
of novel oligo(p-phenylene ethynylene) electrolytes
(OPEs) as optical sensors for amyloid fibrils formed from hen egg-white
lysozyme.24 The fibrils formed by incubating
the lysozyme under acidic conditions are structurally and morphologically
indistinguishable from those formed from the disease-associated proteins.
Lysozyme oligomers and fibrils have also been shown to be cytotoxic
toward the human neuroblastoma cells,25 indicating that the aggregates of lysozyme recapitulate the biological
activities of the known disease-associated proteins. Four OPEs (Table 1, compounds B4, B5,
B6, and OPE1), differing in charge and size, were tested and found
to selectively detect lysozyme fibrils in vitro by binding-activated
increase in the fluorescence yield, with low micromolar affinity and
high selectivity for the amyloid conformation of lysozyme over the
native conformation of protein.23 On the
basis of spectral properties and previous work in analogous systems,
we posit that the fluorescence turn-on mechanism is a combination
of OPE backbone planarization, reduction of solvent-mediated quenching
of the OPE ethyl ester end groups, and the formation of chiral J-type
OPE aggregates templated on the lysozyme fibril surface.23

Table 1 Structures of the
18 PPE-Based Oligomers
and Polymers Used in This Study
To validate that the OPEs are useful optical sensors
that can selectively
detect the fibrillar amyloid conformation of proteins independent
of the properties of the underlying protomer, we report here the binding
and fluorescence of the OPE compounds to the fibrils formed from another
model amyloid protein, bovine insulin. Similar to lysozyme, insulin
readily forms fibrillar aggregates when incubated under acidic and
high-temperature conditions. Moreover, while lysozyme is positively
charged at neutral pH, insulin is negatively charged at the same pH.
The common fibrillar morphology of lysozyme and insulin aggregates,
combined with large differences in the charge states of the proteins,
allowed for testing the selectivity of the OPE sensors for fibrillar
over monomeric protein conformations. In this study, we additionally
tested a small library of oligomeric and polymeric phenyleneethynylenes
(PPEs) (Table 1) to
further probe the effects of charge and substituents on fluorophore
amyloid binding and recognition and compare the amyloid interactions
of the conjugated small molecules of varying size and conjugated polymers.
The results of this study support previous research into the molecular
mechanism of amyloid detection by small molecules and provide insights
into new properties that may allow enhanced detection of these important
analytes.

Results and Discussion
The library of 18 conjugated
compounds tested (Table 1) comprises a variety of molecular
weights, charge densities, water solubilities, and types and geometries
of functional groups, all based on the linear PPE molecular scaffold.
Twelve oligomeric PPE compounds with well-defined molecular weights
were used. Compounds A1, A2, and A3 are cationic and relatively small
molecules with no side chains and charged end groups with varying
hydrophobicity. The B series compounds and OPE1 have side chains that
are either cationic (B1–B8) or anionic (OPE1) and have different
end groups and a varying number of repeat units (n = 1, 2, or 3). The six polymeric compounds have high and not well-defined
molecular weights (n < 1000) and vary in the conjugated
backbone structure and cationic side chains. The oligomeric compounds
are water-soluble and well-dispersed in aqueous solutions. Although
the charged polymers are also water-soluble, they form aggregates
in aqueous solutions.26 From this structural
diversity, we expect to validate and glean some guiding principles
for functional amyloid sensor molecules and investigate structure–property
relationships for binding-activated photophysical changes.

To
test the efficacy of the library of PPE-based compounds to selectively
detect protein aggregates, the excitation and emission fluorescence
spectra of each compound were measured after incubation with the monomeric
or fibrillar hen egg-white lysozyme and bovine insulin. As these two
proteins differ in their charge, hydrophobicity, and surface residues,
they are well-suited to test the robustness of amyloid sensing. The
amyloid aggregates of these two proteins were prepared by the incubation
of the stirred protein solutions at low pH and high temperatures for
24 h. Lysozyme23 and insulin amyloid aggregates
were thioflavin T-positive (Figure S1).
Far-ultraviolet (UV) circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the protein
solutions (Figure 1b,d) confirmed the transformation of the primary α-helical
native structures of both proteins, as shown by the negative bands
at 208 and 222 nm, into the characteristic β-sheet structures
of amyloid fibrils, as shown by the negative band at 218 nm. Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) images of the incubated protein solutions deposited
on mica (Figure 1a,c)
showed short fibrillar aggregates, with individual linear structures
composed of two or more twisted subfibrils, and average dimensions
of about 100 nm long and 20 nm wide. The short fibril morphology is
consistent with incubation conditions where low pH and high temperature
caused fast fibril nucleation and growth, and agitation caused competing
fibril fragmentation.

Figure 1 AFM images of insulin (a) and lysozyme (c) fibrils deposited
on
mica (imaged in air by the tapping mode). Far-UV CD spectra of insulin
(b) and lysozyme (d) monomers and amyloid fibrils indicate the loss
of native α-helical structures to the formation of β-sheet
secondary structures. The error bars in the CD spectra are standard
errors of replicate measurements of the same sample.

The in vitro formed amyloid aggregates of lysozyme
and insulin
were tested against the 18 different PPE dyes with a significant structural
heterogeneity (Table 1). The fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of the dyes alone
in buffer, with a monomeric protein, and with an aggregated protein
were recorded, with the main readout of interest being the changes
in emission intensity and the shifts in excitation or emission wavelengths.
Complete spectral data can be found in the Supporting Information. To ease the evaluation of amyloid sensing, that
is, whether a compound exhibits selective sensing of the fibrillar
conformation of a protein over its native structure, the fluorescence
spectral data were processed and reduced to a factor quantifying the
selective amyloid-sensing performance, the amyloid detection factor
(ADF), using eq 1 1  where Fdye+monomer is the integrated fluorescence signal of the
dye in solution with
the native protein, Fdye+fibril is the
fluorescence signal of the dye in solution with amyloid aggregates
of the protein, and Fdye in buffer is the fluorescence signal of the dye alone in buffer. Integrated
rather than the peak fluorescence intensity values were used to better
model the situation in the microscope, where all photons that pass
through the filter set are integrated at the detector. As defined,
the ADF value is thus indicative of the ability of a dye to selectively
detect the amyloid conformation of a protein from its native confirmation
relative to the background fluorescence of the dye in buffer. As such,
the ADF values near zero indicate that the dye does not distinguish
between the monomeric and fibrillar states of a protein. This effect
is due to the lack of dye binding or binding without a concomitant
increase in the fluorescence signal. The negative ADF values indicate
that the dyes exhibited higher fluorescence in the presence of protein
monomers than protein fibrils; the dyes are thus selective sensors
for the monomeric protein conformation. The positive ADF values indicate
that the dyes yielded higher fluorescence in the presence of fibrillar
aggregates of a protein than monomers; these dyes are thus selective
sensors for the protein amyloid state and potentially useful sensors
for protein aggregate biomarkers. Furthermore, the magnitude of the
ADF value indicates the extent by which the dye distinguishes the
fibrillar versus the monomeric state of the protein over background
fluorescence of the dye. The larger the ADF value, the better the
sensor signal. This data processing and reduction approach allowed
us to easily identify compounds in the library that exhibited useful
photophysical changes when interacting with amyloid. Figure 2 summarizes the ADF values
obtained for the 18 conjugated compounds for both lysozyme and insulin
proteins.

Figure 2 ADF values of 18 PPE-based dyes for insulin and lysozyme amyloids.
Dye and protein concentrations were 2 μM and 1.88 μg/mL,
respectively.

As shown in Figure 2, many of the tested
compounds gave rise to the ADF values close
to 0 (within the gray “insensitive” zone in the figure),
indicating that either these compounds did not bind to the proteins
or any interaction with the proteins did not lead to changes in fluorescence.
The oligomeric compounds A1, A2, and A3 had significant background
fluorescence in buffer and did not exhibit increased fluorescence
in the presence of either monomeric or fibrillar lysozyme or insulin
(Figure S4). Most of the polymeric compounds,
C1, C3, C4, C5, and C6, also gave rise to the ADF values close to
0. These compounds have significant background fluorescence in buffer,
and although some compounds exhibited increases in fluorescence when
added to protein monomers or fibrils, their fluorescence signals were
not useful as they were not selective for either the fibrillar or
the monomeric state of lysozyme or insulin (Figures S8 and S9). However, enhanced fluorescence was observed for
many compounds when they were mixed with protein monomers or fibrils
as the dyes gave rise to large positive ADF values (fibril selective)
or large negative values (monomer selective), including most oligomeric
compounds in the B series and the polymeric compound C2. A few of
the dyes were effective sensors for the fibrillar conformation of
one protein (positive ADF values) and for the monomeric conformation
of the other protein (negative ADF values), including B3, B5, and
B6. Importantly, two small dyes, cationic B4 and anionic OPE1, are
identified as selective sensors for both lysozyme and insulin fibrils,
as the positive ADF values were obtained for each dye for both proteins.
As the magnitude of the ADF values for OPE1 was larger than that for
B4, the anionic OPE1 compound appears to be the more sensitive selective
amyloid sensor from the library of PPE compounds screened. In addition
to identifying useful sensors, other useful observations about the
effects of substituents on the conjugated backbone, charge, and molecular
size on the amyloid-sensing effectiveness of the dyes can be gleaned
from the ADF results.

The effect of substituents on dye sensing
is especially stark.
Except for the polymers (C2), the only dyes with significant positive
ADF values, that is, selective detectors of amyloid, were B4, B5,
B6, and OPE1, all bearing ethyl ester end groups. This small structural
substitution has profound effects on the photophysical properties
of the compounds. Whereas the fluorescence quantum yields of H- and
ester-terminated dyes such as B1, B2, B3, and B8 were similar in methanol
and water, the quantum yields of the ethyl ester terminated dyes B4,
B5, B6, and OPE1 are dramatically reduced in water compared to those
in methanol (Table 2), providing a mechanism for the hydrophobicity-induced unquenching.
The ester groups provide, through a complex mechanism27 that is not yet completely understood, a means for the
efficient nonradiative transfer of excited-state energy to solvent
modes in aqueous solutions, massively reducing the fluorescence yield.
The ester-terminated series of PPE compounds is thus highly sensitive
to detecting their solvation environment. The binding of dyes containing
ethyl ester groups to proteins, likely mediated by hydrophobic interactions
between protein residues and the hydrophobic backbone of the PPE compounds,28 is indeed dramatically transduced to large increases
in fluorescence (see Figure S6 and OPE1
spectra in Figure S7). As the molecular-level
details of dye–protein interactions and influence of different
substituents on the electronic properties of these structurally related
dyes are unclear, further exploration is warranted.

Charge
had a major effect on the ADF performance of all dyes, especially
on their ability to selectively distinguish between the monomeric
and fibrillar protein conformations. Figure 3 shows the integrated fluorescence intensities
of the dyes that were identified from the ADF values (Figure 2) to exhibit selective sensing
of either the monomeric state (negative ADF values) or the fibrillar
state (positive ADF values) of lysozyme or insulin. As shown, the
larger cationic ethyl ester terminated dyes, B5 (n = 2) and B6 (n = 2), were very effective at selectively
detecting lysozyme fibrils, for which large increases in fluorescence
intensities were observed when the compounds were mixed with lysozyme
fibrils and only small increases were observed when the compounds
were mixed with lysozyme monomers. However, sensing selectivity was
reversed when the dyes were mixed with insulin fibrils: large increases
in fluorescence intensities were observed when the compounds were
mixed with insulin monomers and only small or no increase was observed
when the compounds were mixed with insulin fibrils. The significant
increases in the fluorescence of the B5 and B6 compounds to insulin
monomers can be attributed to binding because of attractive Coulombic
interactions between the cationic compounds and a negatively charged
insulin monomer at neutral pH. This long-range attractive interaction
allows the dye and an insulin monomer to approach close enough for
the dye to bind to the hydrophobic pockets on the protein surface.
Once bound, the ethyl ester terminated compounds exhibit hydrophobicity-induced
unquenching, yielding large increases in the fluorescence intensity.
Overall, the larger cationic ethyl ester terminated B5 and B6 compounds
are good sensors as the binding of these compounds to lysozyme fibrils
and insulin monomers resulted in large increases in the fluorescence
signal. However, they are not suitable amyloid sensors, as their sensing
is protein-specific and they did not detect the amyloid conformation
of the insulin protein (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Background-subtracted-integrated fluorescence signals from various
dyes of interest with different protein preparations. “ns”
indicates no significant difference at p < 0.10.

On the basis of Coulombic interactions,
the anionic dyes B7, B8,
and OPE1 are expected to exhibit favorable binding to the positively
charged lysozyme monomers at neutral pH. However, significant enhancement
in fluorescence was not observed (Figure S7). Compounds B7 and B8 do not possess the ethyl ester end groups
that give rise to fluorescence quenching in aqueous solutions, as
shown by the comparable fluorescence quantum yield values of these
two compounds in methanol and water (Table 2). Thus, even if these compounds bind to
lysozyme based on favorable Coulombic interactions, the dyes are not
useful sensors as the binding is not accompanied by increases in the
fluorescence signal. By contrast, the fluorescence of B7 and B8 decreased
in the presence of lysozyme monomers and fibrils compared to the fluorescence
of the dye in buffer (Figures 4c and S7). The best selective amyloid
sensor identified in this screening study is the small anionic OPE1
compound as it exhibited increased fluorescence in the presence of
both lysozyme and insulin fibrils (Figures 3 and 4). Importantly,
only small increases in the fluorescence of OPE1 were observed in
the presence of a monomeric lysozyme or insulin. On the basis of Coulombic
interactions, the anionic OPE1 compound is expected to favorably bind
to the cationic insulin monomers. However, very little binding between
OPE1 and insulin monomer was observed. Although this effect cannot
yet be fully explained, we postulate that this effect is due to the
higher solvation energy of the anionic −SO3– group as compared to that of the −NMe3+ group in B5 and B6, reducing the propensity of the OPE1
molecule to desolvate and bind to hydrophobic patches on the protein
monomer. Experimental29 and theoretical30 studies show that the Gibbs free energies of
the aqueous solvation for −SO3– versus −NMe3+ differ by several hundred
kcal/mol because of the larger size of the anion and its greater number
of H-bond acceptors.

OPE1 (a
and b) vs the anionic H-terminated B7 (c and d) with lysozyme (a and
c) and insulin (b and d) proteins. Chromophoric ethyl ester substitution
has profound effects on the fluorescent response to protein aggregates.

Size is the third major characteristic
affecting the dye performance.
The small-end-substituted dyes A1, A2, and A3, although perhaps capable
of binding appropriately, lack a mechanism for enhancement in the
fluorescence signal upon binding. In fact, these molecules have been
shown to lose the fluorescence yield when complexed because of the
formation of H-type aggregates.31 Polymers
(compounds C1–C6), for the most part, did not perform well
either. Increases in fluorescence were observed when a few of the
cationic polymers were added to anionic lysozyme fibrils (Figure S8). However, as no fluorescence increases
were observed when the compounds were added to insulin fibrils, these
dyes were not useful amyloid sensors. Performance of these polymeric
compounds was likely affected by the size mismatch with a binding
site or solubility problems. Because of their extended hydrophobic
backbone, many of these polymers are highly self-aggregated in aqueous
solutions, resulting in low solubility and depressed emission intensity.26 These high-molecular-weight polymers are unlikely
candidates for tissue stains or in vivo fluorescent probes because
they are unlikely to transit membranes readily or diffuse very far.
The series of cationic ethyl ester terminated oligomeric B4, B5, and
B6 compounds provide an extremely useful insight into size effects
on the amyloid detection performance. These three dyes vary only in
the number of repeat units, and their ADF values of lysozyme sensing
shown in Figure 2 (gray
bars) show a clear optimum at the size of B5 (n =
2), with five phenyl rings in the PPE chromophore. B4 (n = 1) is too small to have enough exposed hydrophobic surface to
bind strongly to yield large increases in fluorescence, and B6 does
not have enough of the chromophore bound to protein to elicit unquenching
of the ethyl ester end groups, or possibly the end groups are not
sufficiently shielded from water in the bound state. The typical twisted
amyloid structural model, which places the hydrophobic binding grooves
at an angle to the fibril axis, indicates the possibility of a maximum
effective size for a linear chromophore to bind: if the chromophore
is too long, it cannot conform to the curvature of the binding site.
Possibly longer chromophores may be effective if they have a flexible
backbone structure.32

Overall, our
results show that small changes in the dye structure
can have a profound effect on the amyloid sensor performance. The
least effective sensors were the dyes with charged groups on the ends
(A1, A2, and A3) and those with charged groups on the sides of the
chain and no moiety on the terminal phenyl rings (B1, B2, and B3).
The cationic ester-terminated dyes (B4, B5, and B6) were more responsive
to the presence of protein but had significant drawbacks. These compounds
interacted with and exhibited enhanced fluorescence with both native
and fibrillar insulin, as indicated by their negative ADF values in Figure 2 (see also Figure S6), and the longer dyes (B5 and B6, with n = 2 and 3 repeat units, respectively) had some selectivity
for lysozyme amyloid, but overall none of these dyes performed well
relative to others in the screening set.

The sole dye found
to perform effectively as a selective sensor
for the amyloid conformation of the two model proteins was the small
anionic OPE1 that vastly outperformed even very close structural analogues.
Fluorescence of the anionic OPE1 was low in the presence of both cationic
lysozyme monomers and anionic insulin monomers (Figure 4a,b). In the presence of fibrillar aggregates,
OPE1 exhibited large increases in the binding-activated fluorescence.
Thus, OPE1 is a protein-conformation selective sensor and not a protein-specific
sensor. OPE1 binds to lysozyme and insulin amyloid fibrils with dissociation
constants (Kd) in the low micromolar range
(Table 3), similar
to those previously reported by our group for similar ethyl ester
substituted PPE small molecules.23 Reported
dissociation constants for thioflavin T binding to insulin and lysozyme
amyloid vary but range between 500 nM and 23 μM for insulin
fibrils33 and between 150 nM and 25 μM
for lysozyme fibrils,34 putting OPE1 well
in the useful range of affinities. Induced CD was also observed for
OPE1 with insulin and lysozyme amyloids (Figure S2), indicating that the dye binds as a chiral complex, possibly
a chirally biased J-type dimer. The peak of the emission spectrum
for OPE1 bound to the insulin amyloid is blue-shifted with respect
to the emission peak of OPE1 bound to the lysozyme amyloid (Figure 4b), indicating that
the J-aggregate character is more dominant in the insulin-bound population.
Comparison of the fluorescence spectra of OPE1 with those of its structural
analogue B7 (Figure 4, top and bottom) demonstrates the importance of a substituent on
effective sensing. B7 and OPE1 are identical except that OPE1 bears
ethyl esters on both ends of the conjugated backbone, whereas B7 does
not. B7 loses some fluorescence yield in the presence of lysozyme
monomers or fibrils and is completely insensitive to insulin in any
form. The anionic OPE1 is the only molecule with positive ADF values
for both lysozyme and insulin amyloid.

Conclusions
This
study evaluated a small library of 18 different fluorescent
compounds based on a p-PPE backbone for their ability
to selectively detect the amyloid aggregate conformers of two model
amyloid proteins. Most of the compounds showed some nonspecific binding
to protein monomers, and some were able to detect amyloids of either
insulin or lysozyme, but only one compound performed effectively with
both proteins: a shorter compound with anionic sulfonate solubilizing
groups and ethyl ester end groups (Figure 5).

anionic OPE1 and cationic
B5 to lysozyme and insulin monomers and fibrils. Red indicates the
positively charged species, and blue indicates the negatively charged
species.

The very small and hydrophobic
end-functionalized compounds (A1,
A2, and A3) did not effectively sense the amyloid state, possibly
because they can nonspecifically interact with many binding sites.
These compounds have been shown to have high toxicity to bacterial
cells and to inactivate viruses, suggesting that they can interact
destructively with proteins. We might have expected that the very
large repeating polymeric dyes would sense amyloids with high selectivity
because of their long linear chains binding to equally long linear
aggregate structures. The results show that this was not the case—some
polymers bound to amyloids with moderate sensitivity, but none bound
well to both insulin and lysozyme amyloid.

Exchanging cationic
quaternary ammonium groups for anionic sulfonate
groups has multiple profound effects on the mechanics of binding,
as evidenced by the formation of less emissive states by B7 and B8
dyes and the very different behavior of OPE1 and B5 (Figure 5). For small molecules, the
anionic groups seem to reduce nonspecific binding to monomers appreciably,
especially for insulin. We postulate that this effect is due to the
higher solvation energy of the −SO3– group
as compared to that of the −NMe3+ group, reducing
the propensity of the molecule to desolvate and bind to hydrophobic
patches on the protein monomer.

The results of this study have
provided some structural insights
into the binding and fluorescence sensing of amyloids by PPE-based
dyes. For this class of compounds, restriction of intramolecular motion
by binding alone does not seem to be sufficient for the sensitive
monomer-independent detection of amyloids—that is, they do
not function like a molecular rotor. A secondary mechanism of binding-activated
quantum yield increase (in this case, unquenching by reduced water
accessibility) is necessary to produce an effective sensor. Overall,
anionic structures are less prone to nonspecific binding and more
broadly biocompatible, and smaller size seems to be crucial for effective
interaction. These results will provide guidelines for future investigation
of amyloid-binding fluorogenic dyes.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of PPE dyes was reported previously.35−40 Hen egg-white lysozyme and bovine insulin were obtained as lyophilized
powders from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used without further
purification. Salts and reagents used to make buffers were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. Thioflavin T (ThT) was obtained from VWR International
(Radnor, PA). Water used was purified to a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ
at 25 °C (Millipore Synergy UV purification system, EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA). All experiments were performed in duplicate, and the
mean values were reported with standard error. Paired t-test was carried out to assess the statistical significance of the
difference between the PPE fibril fluorescence and the PPE monomer
fluorescence. The spectra reported are a single representative experiment.

Lysozyme and insulin fibrils were prepared by dissolving each protein
at 5.46 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 3 with 0.1 M NaCl
and by incubating at 70 °C for 12 h with 250 rpm magnetic stirring.
Extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 1.0 L/(g·cm) for insulin41 and 2.63 L/(g·cm) for lysozyme42 were used to determine the concentrations. Both
protein solutions, initially clear, formed a cloudy precipitate within
an hour of heating. For ThT assay, protein and ThT stock solutions
were mixed in pH 7.4 10 mM phosphate buffer (PB) to a final concentration
of 5 μg/mL protein and 20 μM ThT, and the emission spectra
were obtained at 440 nm excitation (Figure S1). Presence of amyloids was confirmed by the direct observation of
fibril morphology with AFM on mica in air (Figure 1).

In the wells of a 96-well plate,
a monomeric protein, an amyloid,
or a buffer blank was diluted with dye stocks into PB to a final concentration
of 2 μM OPE or 1.88 μg/mL PPE (the same monomer concentration
as the intermediate-size OPEs) and 5 μg/mL protein. The final
sample volume was 200 μL, and each well was prepared in duplicate.
The absorption and emission spectra of the samples were then measured
on a plate-reading spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M2e, Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). For the higher resolution evaluation of spectral changes,
a steady-state cuvette-reading fluorimeter (PTI QuantaMaster 40, HORIBA
Scientific, Edison, NJ) was used. The same concentration and sample
volumes were prepared and transferred to a small-volume quartz fluorimetry
cuvette (Starna Cells, Atascadero, CA), and the excitation and emission
spectra were obtained. To determine the secondary structures of a
protein (Figure S3), CD spectra of the
protein samples, diluted in pH 3 10 mM sodium citrate buffer without
NaCl to a concentration of 0.14 mg/mL, were recorded using an Aviv
410 CD spectrometer (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ) with a 15 s averaging
time. A blank spectrum (buffer only) was subtracted from that of each
sample to remove the background signal. The error bars are standard
deviations over multiple reads of a single sample as reported by the
AVIV software. For OPE-induced CD, OPEs and protein were diluted in
PB to an OPE and a protein concentration of 5 μM, and the data
were obtained and processed identically to the protein CD experiments.
For binding constant determinations, the matured fibrils were first
separated from the residual monomeric and smaller aggregated proteins
by repeatedly passing the diluted solutions through a 30 kDa molecular
weight cutoff Amicon centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA). The concentration of the fibril solution was determined by measuring
the absorbance at 280 nm. The fluorescence of the samples containing
a fixed fibril concentration (500 nM) and a range of OPE concentrations
was measured using a spectrofluorometer. Peak fluorescence values
versus the OPE concentration was subsequently plotted and fitted to
the Hill equation43 using OriginPro 9 to
obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values.
