In this paper, we report on the unexplored
reaction mechanisms
of bimolecular homolytic substitution
(SH2) between GeH3 radicals and the nitrogen
atom of NF3. The SH2 reactions are studied both
experimentally and theoretically with ab initio and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. The experimental results of X-ray irradiation
of mixtures of GeH4 and NF3 show the formation
of GeH3–NF2 and GeH3–F.
The trend of product yields as a function of the increase in GeH4 partial pressure in the irradiated mixtures evidences the
predominant role of GeH3 radicals. Particularly, the SH2 mechanism can be hypothesized for the reaction between GeH3 radicals and NF3 molecules leading to GeH3–NF2. This mechanism is further confirmed
by the increase in GeH3–NF2 yield observed
if O2 is added, as a radical scavenger, to the reaction
mixture. In agreement with the experimental data, from the calculations
performed at the CCSD(T) and G3B3 levels of theory, we observe that
the GeH3–NF2 product actually occurs
from a bimolecular homolytic substitution by the GeH3 radical,
which attacks the N atom of NF3, and this reaction is in
competition with the fluorine abstraction reaction leading to GeH3F, even if other mechanisms may be involved in the formation
of this product.

Introduction
Bimolecular homolytic
substitution (SH2) reactions are
classical reactions of free radicals, following reaction 1 1  Over the years, the SH2 reactions
(reaction 1) have received
considerable attention both from experimental and theoretical points
of view. In fact, they are elementary steps of many chemical reactions,
are observed with different types of radicals (R1), and
can be useful not only in the development of novel synthetic methodologies,
particularly to generate new radicals, but also for the formation
of carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds (C–S,
C–Si, C–Se, C–Sn, and so forth).1

Generally, these reactions occur at the univalent
hydrogen or halogen
atoms (Y = H, Cl, Br, I) but mostly proceed at the main-group heteroatoms
(Y = Si, Ge, Sn, P, O, S, and Se, Te).2

It is generally recognized that the SH2 reactions
occur
with a backside mechanism, in which the attack of R1 and
the expulsion of R2 (in reaction 1) occur in opposite directions and involve
a collinear (or nearly collinear) transition structure (TS) or a hypervalent
intermediate.3−5 A frontside R1 attack has also been proposed,
and the two mechanisms can be in competition.

Both of the mentioned
mechanisms can occur for the homolytic substitution
of methyl and acetyl radicals at disilane, digermane, distannane,
silylgermane, silylstannane, and germylstannane.6 Recently, the reaction of phenyl radicals with silane was
studied both experimentally and theoretically to investigate the chemical
dynamics of phenylsilane formation via bimolecular radical substitution.7 The occurrence of frontside and backside mechanisms
in the homolytic substitution by silyl, germyl, and stannyl radicals
at the heteroatom in disilane, digermane, distannane, silylgermane,
silylstannane, and germylstannane has also been theoretically investigated
by Schiesser and co-workers.8 Processes
like these were first reported by Cadman et al.,9 and more recently, Belter10 explored
the reactivity of NF3 with aliphatic and aromatic substrates.
However, despite the general interest in this kind of reaction, there
is a lack of information about the SH2 reaction between
radicals and nitrogen-containing molecules.

In our previous
work, we investigated the reactions between NF3 and the
radicals CH3, C2H5, and i-C3H7, generated by
X-ray irradiation of the corresponding iodides R-I, and we performed
ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the
observed reactions. The results of our investigation indicate that
R-NF2 is obtained from a SH2 reaction by the
alkyl radicals R, which attack the N atom of NF3, while
the attack of alkyl radicals at the F atom(s) of NF311 leads to R-F products.

In this work, following
our interest in the gas-phase reactions
between the fluorinated compounds and hydrides of C, Si, and Ge,12 we decided to further investigate the SH2 reactions at the nitrogen atom using NF3 as a
substrate. In particular, taking into account that the homolytic bimolecular
substitution mechanism that occurs at the nitrogen atom by means of
the germyl radical is still not explored, we studied the reactions
between GeH3 radicals generated by X-ray irradiation and
NF3. For this purpose, we used a combined approach involving
long-time static X-ray radiolysis, gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry analysis at very low temperatures, and high-level theoretical
calculations. We irradiated mixtures of GeH4/NF3 at several partial pressures of reagents, with different irradiation
doses. Moreover, we also used an effective Ge and GeH2 radical
scavenger to highlight the reactions of the GeH3 radicals.
Three different levels of theory (CASSCF, CCST(T), and G3B3) have
been used to verify the expected reaction mechanisms between the GeH3 radicals and the NF3 molecules.

Results and Discussion
Radiolysis
of GeH4/NF3 Mixtures
X-ray irradiation
of GeH4/NF3 mixtures can
produce both ionic and radical species that lead to the formation
of new gaseous species and to the deposition of solid products.

The relative contribution of radicals and ions to the formed products
can be evaluated considering the average energy absorbed to form the
ion pair, W (i.e., the energy related to the process:
M → M+ + e–; M = GeH4 or NF3), and the ionization energy, I.13,14 The difference between W and I is always positive,
and the W – I excess energy is available to
form excited molecules and/or radicals.

During the radiolysis
of pure NF3, the following radicals
are produced, according to the dissociation reaction: 2  The primary radicals formed during the radiolysis
of pure GeH4 are germyl (GeH3) and germylene
(GeH2) radicals; it has been proposed15 that their formation occurs by decomposition of excited
molecules according to eqs 3 and 4 3   4  The activation energy required for
the formation
of GeH3 and GeH2 radicals is 355.6 and 221.8
kJ mol–1, respectively; thus, the reaction forming
GeH2 radicals is favored.16 Moreover,
it was also observed that GeH2 is further decomposed to
give Ge and GeH and the corresponding reactions compete with each
other in the ratio 9:1.15

The W and I values of NF3 and GeH4 are
listed in Table 1,
together with the energy values related to reactions 2–4.16

a The calculated
number of radicals
for each formed ion is also shown.

b The experimental values of W for NF3 and GeH4 are not available,
but it is known that for gaseous molecules the ratio W/I ranges from 2.2 to 2.6.23 Thus, W was obtained from the average value of W/I and the ionization potential of NF316 and GeH4.24

From these data, it is possible
to evaluate the radicals formed
for each ion: about seven from NF3 and about four or six
from GeH4 if reactions 3 and 4 are considered, respectively.
Therefore, the observed products obtained from radiolysis can be considered
to be mainly due to radical reactions.

Moreover, the total energy
absorbed by the mixture is related to
the irradiation dose (Gy = J Kg–1), and it is shared
between GeH4 and NF3 on the basis of their mass.
Therefore, even if it is not possible to calculate the actual yields
of the GeH3 and GeH2 primary radicals, it is
reasonable to suppose that the total energy absorbed by germane is
split in reactions 3 and 4 with the same ratio in all mixtures, and hence,
the GeH3/GeH2 radical ratio is constant.

All radicals formed participate in the reactions leading to solid
and gaseous products, but the results of our previous works obtained
from theoretical calculations, mass spectrometry, and radiolysis on
mixtures containing germane with and without oxygen indicate that
the radicals involved in the deposition of the solid product are different
from the radical precursors of primary gaseous species detected after
radiolysis experiments.15,17 In particular, the
hydrogen-poor species from germane (GeH2 and Ge radicals
and ions) are involved in the polymerization processes leading to
solid products but not in those leading to primary gaseous products.
In fact, if O2 is added as a radical scavenger (which reacts
with GeH2 but not with GeH3), an oxygenated
solid product is obtained, whereas no variation in gaseous product
yields is observed.15,17 This fact also indicates that
the GeH3 (radicals and ions) can be considered to be related
to the formation of the observed primary gaseous species.15,17 On the other hand, in a previous work on ion–molecule reactions
occurring in the GeH4/NF3gaseous mixture investigated
by ion trap mass spectrometry and ab initio calculations,12b we observed that the GeH3+ ion does not react with NF3 and no ionic products with
Ge–N connectivity12b,12c were evidenced. Therefore,
it is reasonable to suppose that the primary gaseous species observed
after radiolysis are attributable to reactions involving GeH3 radicals.

The characterization of solids obtained from irradiation
of the
GeH4/NF3 mixtures indicates that they are networked
polymers of Ge and N, with dangling bonds saturated with F and H atoms.
The average empirical formula (obtained by elemental and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis) and hydrogenation degree (H/(Ge + N)
atomic ratio) of the solids obtained by X-ray irradiation (100 kGy)
of the GeH4/NF3 mixtures with different compositions
are reported in Table 2.

Degree (H/(Ge + N) Atomic Ratio) of the Solids Obtained by X-ray Irradiation,

Different Compositions

The low values of the
hydrogenation degree of solids, varying between
1.40 and 1.18 when GeH4 ranges from 70 to 30%, suggest
that even in the GeH4/NF3 mixtures the hydrogen-poor
active species (principally radicals) of germane play a predominant
role in the reaction pattern, leading to the condensed phase and confirming
the above-reported hypothesis.

The gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS)
analysis of the gas phase after irradiation of GeH4/NF3 mixtures shows that GeH3F forms in an appreciable
quantity and GeH3NF2 in smaller quantities.
Other products are also observed: a fair amount of digermane and a
small amount of HNF2. The product yields detected from
experiments performed with two different irradiation doses (100 and
200 kGy) and with different GeH4/NF3 relative
pressures are shown in Table 3.

a μ-mole determinations are
affected by errors of about ±15%; 1.0 Torr = 1.91 × 10–2 mmol.

From Table 3, it
is observed that the yields of GeH3F and GeH3NF2 in the gas phase increase if the GeH4 relative
pressure in the irradiated mixture is increased, suggesting that even
for GeH4/NF3 mixtures the reactions leading
to gaseous products happen through mechanisms that involve germyl
radicals and NF3 molecules. This process contributes only
in part to the GeH3F product, and other processes must
be considered; for example, the substitution reaction of F radicals
that replace the hydrogen of GeH4. In fact, the ratio between
the GeH3F and GeH3NF2 product yields
decreases if the NF3 percentage in the mixture is increased,
suggesting that the F radicals produced by X-ray fragmentation of
NF3 contribute to the formation of the GeH3F
product. Nevertheless, the finding that the GeH3F yield
decreases significantly even if NF3 increases from 30 to
70% (and hence F radicals are increased by a factor of 2.3) indicates
that the F radicals contribute to the total GeH3F amount
only to a minor extent.

Table 4 reports
the results of GC–MS analysis of the gas phase after irradiation
of the GeH4/NF3 mixtures with different partial
pressures of GeH4 (600 and 400 Torr) and a constant partial
pressure of NF3 (400 Torr). Table 4 also reports the results obtained by adding
O2 as a radical scavenger.

a The results obtained by adding O2 as a radical scavenger are also shown.

b μ-mole determinations are
affected by errors of about ±15%; 1.0 Torr = 1.91 × 10–2 mmol.

The
results of Table 4 show
a sharp decrease in both GeH3F and GeH3NF2 products with decreasing GeH4 partial pressure
but a constant partial pressure of NF3 (400 Torr) and,
hence, with the expected same amount of F radicals. This fact evidences
the predominant role of GeH3, confirming the above hypothesis.

Table 3 also shows
the variations of GeH3F and GeH3NF2 yields with different irradiation doses. To explain these results,
it must be considered that the new products formed by irradiation
modify the mixture composition and can participate in the reaction
as both molecular and radical/ionic species. Thus, the observed yields
are a result of the competition between formation and decomposition
reactions, and they can vary with doses in a not easily predictable
way. Nevertheless, from Table 3, some qualitative considerations can be made: (i) the GeH3F and GeH3NF2 yields increase with dose
for all mixtures (except for GeH3NF2 in the
50% mixture), indicating that the formation reaction always prevails
over the decomposition one and suggesting the high stability of these
species even under the radiolysis condition; (ii) the sharp increase
in GeH3F with dose indicates the rather high reactivity
of GeH3 radicals toward NF3; (iii) the yield
increment of the gaseous products is higher if the NF3 percentage
in the mixture increases: variations from 47 to 160% and from 14 to
46% for GeH3F and GeH3NF2 are observed,
respectively, if the NF3 pressure is varied from 30 to
70%. This confirms the above-reported hypothesis that the GeH2 radicals play a predominant role in the polymerization process,
leading to solid deposition, while the GeH3 radicals are
involved in the reaction mechanisms of the gaseous product formation.

In fact, even the products of radiolysis, such as GeH3F and GeH3NF2, can react with GeH2 radicals in the radical polymerization reactions leading to solid
products; for example 5   6  The lower amount of GeH2 radicals
in the higher NF3 percentage mixture makes reactions 5 and 6 less probable, favoring the increase in the yields of GeH3F and GeH3NF2.

The same effect is obtained
if O2 is used as a radical
scavenger (Table 4).
In fact, oxygen effectively scavenges the GeH2 radicals
but not the GeH3 radicals,15,17 leading to
oxygenated solid products, thus decreasing the extent of reactions 5 and 6 and increasing the GeH3F and GeH3NF2 yields.

Computational Results
The experimental
results suggest that both products GeH3–NF2 and GeH3–F can be obtained
by competitive reactions of the GeH3 radicals with NF3. The GeH3–NF2 product can arise
from the bimolecular homolytic substitution (reaction 7), occurring at the nitrogen atom of NF3, while the GeH3–F product can be considered
to be mainly due to the F-atom abstraction reaction (reaction 8) through the attack of GeH3 on the F atom(s) of NF3, even if other reaction
mechanisms can contribute to this product yield. 7   8  To confirm the experimental results
and the
predicted reaction mechanisms, a theoretical study of the potential
energy surface related to the reactions of GeH3 with NF3 was carried out.

The geometries of intermediates and
TSS (Figures 1 and 2) were optimized with three different
theoretical models: a multideterminantal
CASSCF model in conjunction with the 6-31G(d) basis set, perturbative
MP2(full) and DFT/B3LYP methods, which include the electron correlation
with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set.

Several previously
published studies18−22 show that NF3 acts as a Lewis base that
interacts with electrophilic species through the N and F atoms. Therefore,
we explored the attack of GeH3 on both atoms, and located
the energy minima 1 and 2 and the transition
states TS_1 and TS_2 shown in Figures 1 and 2. These minima and TSs are connected as shown in Figure 3. An intermediate 1′ is also formed before reaching the transition states TS_1 and TS_2, but it is thermochemically and
thermodynamically unstable at all levels of calculation (see Figure S1 and Table S4).

The interaction
between the GeH3 radical and the N atom
of NF3 leads to transition state TS_1 and
takes place through the homolytic substitution of GeH3 at
the N atom of NF3 with elimination of an F atom. TS_1 shows a rather long Ge–N bond, as typically occurs
in this mechanism, corresponding to 2.453, 2.532, and 2.249 Å
at the CASSCF, B3LYP, and MP2(full) levels, respectively. The N–F
bond is 1.738, 1.590, and 1.511 Å at the CASSCF, B3LYP, and MP2(full)
levels of theory, respectively. The Ge–N–F angle is
151.6° at the CASSCF level, compared to 146.3 and 147.6°
calculated at the B3LYP and MP2(full) levels of theory, respectively.

The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations show that TS_1 connects the reactants with the weakly bound molecular
complex 1 (see Figure 1). In intermediate 1, an F atom is rather
distant from the N atom of GeH3NF2 and the N–F
bond length and the Ge–N–F bond angle depend on the
computational level. In particular, it progressively reduces from
the CASSCF (2.952 Å, 89.3°) to the B3LYP (1.976 Å,
84.7°) and the MP2(full) (1.948 Å, 70.0°) levels.

The analysis of the occupation of the active space orbitals of
intermediate 1 shows the presence of a doubly occupied
σNF bond orbital and a singly occupied σ*NF antibonding orbital. This electronic configuration together
with the long bond distance and the low dissociation energy allows
us to classify this as a 2c–3e bond.

The interaction
between the GeH3 radical and the F atoms
of NF3 leads to transition state TS_2, which
adopts an almost linear arrangement of the GeH3 radical
and NF2 at any computational level, in agreement with the
previously studied reactions of alkyl radicals with NF3.11 The Ge–F bond distance increases,
according to the calculation level used, from 2.241 to 2.435 and to
2.610 Å at the MP2(full), CASSCF, and B3LYP levels of theory,
respectively. At the MP2(full) and B3LYP levels of theory, the N–F
bond lengths are comparable and amount to 1.515 and 1.525 Å,
respectively. Instead, the CASSCF level furnishes a greater bond distance
of 1.671 Å. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations
show that TS_2 does not connect the reactants to the
products, but to the weakly bound complex 2 (see Figure 2). Complex 2 results from the interaction of the F atom of GeH3F with the N atom of NF2, as shown by the long N–F
bond distance which is 2.923, 2.979, and 3.009 Å, at the CASSCF,
MP2(full), and B3LYP levels of theory, respectively. The analysis
of the occupation of the active space orbitals of intermediate 2 does not allow classifying the interaction between the two
fragments as a 2c–3e bond.

The T1 diagnostics of TS_1 (0.028) and TS_2 (0.025) are slightly higher
than the accepted threshold of 0.020,
for a monodeterminantal wave function. However, the CI coefficients
of the ground-state CASSCF wave function are 0.94 and 0.95 for TS_1 and TS_2, respectively. This indicates that
the greatest weight is given by the ground-state configuration and
also suggests the prevailing role of dynamic correlation, allowing
the use of a monodeterminant theoretical model such as the G3B3.

The SH2 reaction 7, passing through TS_1, shows an enthalpy barrier of 14.8 kcal mol–1 at the CCSD(T)//CASSCF and 18.7 kcal mol–1 at
the CCSD(T)//MP2(full) level, and the F-atom abstraction (reaction 8), passing through TS_2, shows an enthalpy barrier of 7.1 kcal mol–1 at the CCSD(T)//CASSCF and 11.0 kcal mol–1 at
the CCSD(T)//MP2(full) level. The two enthalpy barriers of reactions 7 and 8, at the G3B3 level, correspond to 14.8 and 7.1 kcal mol–1 and coincide surprisingly with the results obtained
at the CCSD(T)//CAS level of theory (Table 5). The small enthalpy difference between
the two barriers allows a competition between the reactions.

The dissociation of complex 1 into the products needs
to overcome an enthalpy barrier of nearly 2 kcal mol–1 at the CCSD(T)//CAS level of theory, which becomes slightly higher
at the CCSD(T)//MP2(full) (7.7 kcal mol–1) and G3B3
levels of theory (6.8 kcal mol–1). Complex 2 dissociates into fragments GeH3F and NF2 through a barrier of 1.2 kcal mol–1 at all computational
levels.

The already known reaction 7 of fluorine atom abstraction by germyl radicals is
exothermic
by 66.9 kcal mol–1, from experimental data.16,23 This result is consistent with our theoretical calculations, which
provide for reaction 7 an exothermicity of 70.8, 69.7, and 67.9 kcal mol–1 at the CCSD(T)//CAS, CCSD(T)//MP2(full), and G3B3 levels of theory,
respectively.

Conclusions
In this work, we report
on the unexplored homolytic bimolecular
substitution mechanism that occurs at the nitrogen atom by means of
a germyl radical. In fact, the experimental and computational results
indicate that the SH2 mechanism effectively occurs, leading
to GeH3NF2, and it is in competition with the
fluorine abstraction reaction, leading to GeH3F.

The computational results have shown that the energy barriers of
the SH2 reaction 7 (about 15–19 kcal mol–1) and of
the fluorine abstraction (8) (about 7–9 kcal mol–1) are slightly different, taking into account that the energies,
obtained at different levels of calculation, are affected by an uncertainty
of about ±2–4 kcal mol–1. The enthalpy
of these two processes is instead very different. Reaction 8 is strongly exothermic by
68–71 kcal mol–1, and this result is in excellent
agreement with the experimental result of about 67 kcal mol–1 in the literature. Instead, reaction 7 is slightly endothermic at all levels of calculation.
Both the energy barriers and the enthalpy of reactions are in good
agreement with the yield of the products obtained from the experiments.
In fact, we have observed the formation of an appreciable amount of
GeH3F from the strongly exothermic reaction
8, with a lower energy barrier, and a minor amount of GeH3NF2 from the slightly endothermic reaction 7, with a higher energy barrier. Furthermore, the
finding that the yields of the two reactions increase as a function
of both the partial pressure of GeH4 and the irradiation
dose and that the same result is obtained after adding O2 as a radical scavenger, which effectively reacts with Ge and GeH2 but not with GeH3, confirms the predominant role
of the germyl radicals in the formation of both products.

Experimental
Methods
Materials
Caution: The preparation and manipulation
of gaseous NF3 and GeH4 and their mixtures require
precaution because explosive products can be formed.

NF3 at 99.99% stated purity and GeH4 and pure O2 were supplied by Praxair. GeH4 was purified by
bulb-to-bulb distillation under vacuum and dried with sodium sulfate
before use. The GeH4/NF3 mixtures were prepared
in 350 mL Pyrex vessels. Standard vacuum techniques were used to handle
reactants and gaseous products.

X-ray Radiolysis
Mixtures of GeH4 + NF3 with different compositions
at a total pressure of 700 Torr
were irradiated at absorbed irradiation doses of 100 and 200 kGy.
GeH4/NF3 mixtures with an NF3 pressure
of 400 Torr and different GeH4 partial pressures [600 and
400 Torr] and with O2 as a radical scavenger were also
irradiated with an irradiation dose of 10 kGy.

A CPXT-320 tube
(GILARDONI) with a maximum output of 320 keV was used as the X-ray
source for irradiation at 100 and 200 kGy doses. An Eresco 160 MF4-R
with a maximum output of 160 keV was used for irradiation at 10 kGy.

Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Analysis
After
irradiation, a small amount of the gaseous phase was collected
for qualitative and quantitative analyses of volatile compounds by
GC–MS. A Varian 3400/ Finnigan ITD instrument was employed,
equipped with an Alltech AT-1 capillary column (polydimethylsiloxane,
30 m long, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 1.0 mm film thickness). Before
injection, the GC oven was cooled at 193 K by introducing liquid nitrogen;
afterward, the column was heated up to 433 K with the following temperature
program: isothermal starting step at 193 K for 4 minutes; heating
step up to 373 K (20 K min–1); isothermal step at
373 K for 10 minutes; heating step up to 433 K (30 K min–1); isothermal step at 433 K for 3 minutes; cooling step to room temperature.
A split of about 16 mL min–1 was applied during
injection; helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.8
mL min–1. Electron ionization was performed at 70
eV, and the spectra were collected in the 15–500 u mass range.

Computational Methods
The calculations were performed
with the GAUSSIAN0925 program. The geometries
of the reagents, intermediates, products, and transition states (TSs)
involved in the reactions between the GeH3 radicals and
NF3 were fully optimized at the complete active space multiconfiguration
self-consistent field level of theory26−28 [CASSCF] in conjunction
with the 6-31G(d) basis set.29 The CASSCF
wave function, labeled (9,6), was built up by distributing nine electrons
in the six orbitals, which are most reasonably involved in the reaction
mechanisms. With reference to the reactants, we included, in particular,
the singly occupied sp hybrid orbitals of the Ge
atom of the GeH3 radicals and five orbitals of NF3, namely, a pair of bonding and antibonding N–F sigma orbitals
(σN–F and σ*N–F), two p orbitals of F, and
the n orbital of N.

The geometries were also
optimized with two different methods containing the electron correlation,
the Møller–Plesset theory30 with inclusion of inner electrons [MP2(full)], and the B3LYP31 hybrid functional [B3LYP] with the 6-311G(d,p)
basis set,29 by gradient-based techniques32−35 and with no symmetry constraints.

Any located critical point
was unambiguously characterized as an
energy minimum or a TS by calculating its analytical vibrational frequencies
at all levels of theory. Any TS was also related to its interconnected
energy minima by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations.36 The unscaled frequencies were also used to calculate
the zero-point vibrational energies (ZPE) and the vibrational contribution
to the thermal correction (TC), obtained at 298.15 K by standard statistical
mechanics formulas.37 The overall TC term
was finally obtained by adding the translational (3/2 RT) and rotational
(RT or 3/2 RT) contributions at this temperature. Total entropies
were also obtained by unscaled frequencies and moments of inertia.
The absolute energies were refined by performing, at the CASSCF and
MP(full) optimized geometries, single-point calculations with the
CCSD(T,full)38,39 method, using the 6-311++G(2d,2p)
basis set.29 The T1 diagnostics40 were calculated at the same level of theory.
Absolute energies were also calculated using the G3B341 composite methods on the B3LYP/ 6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries.
