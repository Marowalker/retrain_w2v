The rigid conformation
of constrained bicyclic peptides provides
a number of advantages over larger protein-based ligands, including
better chemical stability, enhanced tissue penetration, and a wider
field of possible applications. Selective chemical modification strategies
are able to extend the scope of applications not only in a therapeutic
manner but also for the development of novel tools for protein capturing,
bioimaging, and targeted drug delivery. Herein, we report the synthesis
of an adamantane-based, symmetrical, tetravalent, sulfhydryl-specific
peptide linker. We have developed an in vitro two-step modification
strategy that allows the generation of differently functionalized
bicyclic peptides. This “tool kit” strategy was applied
to cyclize and functionalize a phage-encoded peptide library bearing
the sequence CX6CX6C. After phage display against
a model target, isolated peptides show strong consensus sequences,
indicating target-specific binding. The newly developed symmetric
tetravalent linker opens new avenues for the combinatorial selection
and functionalization of bicyclic peptide ligands with affinity to
virtually any target.

Introduction
The
diverse biological activities and favorable properties of chemically
constrained cyclic peptides make them an attractive format for applications
in research and drug development.1,2 Besides enhanced
binding affinities and target specificities of constrained cyclic
peptide scaffolds, they are able to interact with rather flat, featureless
surfaces of proteins and therefore can efficiently target protein–protein
interactions that are difficult to address by small molecules.3 Furthermore, the oral bioavailability for the
therapeutic application of small cyclic peptides has already been
demonstrated.4,5 In comparison to linear peptides,
small cyclic peptides show higher proteolytic stability.4 Heinis and Winter developed a phage display-based
methodology for the selection of chemically modified peptides.6−8 Inspired by the flexible regions of antibodies, their generated
phage library presents peptides that contain two variable hexapeptide
loops flanked by three cysteines.8 Under
physiological conditions, the comparatively high nucleophilicity of
the sulfhydryl moiety of cysteine enables the selective reaction with
certain electrophilic trivalent linker molecules like, e.g., tris(bromomethyl)benzene
(TBMB) to generate bicyclic peptides.9 To
amplify the spectrum of potential applications, herein, we suggest
to expand the one-step modification method on phage toward a two-step
reaction by introducing the tetravalent linker N,N′,N″,N‴-(adamantane-1,3,5,7-tetrayl)tetrakis(2-bromoacetamide)
(NATBA, 8). During the first step, the symmetrical tetravalent
linker is efficiently modified by the three cysteine residues contained
in every peptide of the phage library, leaving the fourth reactive
position unmodified. In the second step of the protocol, this fourth
position can be functionalized by a broad variety of sulfhydryl-bearing
probes, warheads, linkers, tools, or drugs. Following this approach,
the two-step modification allows the phage display of bicyclic peptide
libraries that already bear a functional additive attached to the
adamatane-based linker on phage during the selection process against
any target. This tool kit strategy facilitates the development of
novel peptide hybrids for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.
The tetrahedral symmetry of the adamantane scaffold is an attractive
feature that fulfills the requirements for the development of a tetravalent
linker molecule. To retain the symmetry, the sulfhydryl-reactive moieties
had to be attached to the four bridgehead carbon atoms of the adamantane
structure. Because of its most suitable sulfhydryl-reactivity, the
bromoacetyl group was chosen over other alternatives as the terminal
reactive moiety forming a covalent thioether bond. To develop the
two-step modification protocol, suitable test additives were required.
Biotin and fluorescein as commonly used and easily accessible tools
have been chosen as they provide various assay development possibilities.
Commercially available 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (Flc) and biotin are
easy to equip with sulfhydryl groups by a simple one-step coupling
reaction of 2-aminoethane-1-thiol to the respective carboxy moiety.
These amide coupling reactions result N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-fluorescein-5(6)-carboxamide
(FlcSH, 9) and N-(2-mercaptoethyl)biotinamide
(BiotinSH, 10). Furthermore, we wanted to investigate
the possibility to develop a two-step modification protocol that allows
the attachment of larger much bulkier additives like peptides. For
this purpose, the amphipathic cell-penetrating peptide FΦRRRR
(FΦR4, Φ = l-2-napthylalanine)10−12 was synthesized containing an N-terminal cysteine bound to 6-aminohexanoic
acid (6-Ahx) as a linker that allows the flexible attachment to the
peptide-linker construct. This additive is herein abbreviated as χFΦR4 (χ = Cys-6-Ahx).

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
The most reasonable synthetic route for the
attachment of bromoacetyl moieties to the four bridgehead-carbon atoms
of adamantane is the conjugation of respective bromoacetic acids via
amide bond formation to 1,3,5,7-tetraaminoadamantane (7, see Scheme 1). Synthetic
routes toward functionalized adamantanes have been previously described.13−15 The most common method for the effective fourfold activation of
the bridgehead carbon atoms of adamantane is the aluminum chloride
catalyzed bromination. Commercially available adamantane (1) was applied as starting material. The catalyzed bromination toward
the corresponding 1,3,5,7-tetrabromoadamantane (2) was
performed with a good yield of 68% using elemental bromine and aluminum
chloride under reflux conditions for 10 h.15 The following reaction for 3 was performed with sodium
cyanate in dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent under direct UV (254 nm)
light excitation by a 150 W low-pressure mercury vapor lamp. Different
conditions were tried and the reaction was controlled by thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) analysis. A reaction time of 6 h and stirring
under argon atmosphere gave optimal results. Longer reaction times
did not lead to significantly higher yields but to the formation of
additional side products. Maintaining the reaction temperature below
25 °C resulted in significantly less formation of undesired side
products. After purification, we obtained 3 in 89% yield.
Nitrile hydrolysis for the corresponding carbonic acid (4) was performed under pressure and elevated temperatures using aqueous
sodium hydroxide solution. After a reaction time of 6 h, the free
acid 4 was precipitated by acidification of the reaction
mixture. The hydrolysis led to a good yield of 70% for compound 4. The synthesis of 7 was performed via Curtius
rearrangement. First, 5 was generated by refluxing 4 in thionyl chloride and a catalytic amount of dimethyl formamide.
After 3 h of reaction, the solvent was removed to yield 5 without further purification and characterization. Compund 5 was converted into the azide 6 by the addition
of sodium azide in cold acetone. After 2 h of stirring at room temperature,
the excess sodium azide and generated sodium chloride were removed
by filtration. The careful evaporation of the solvent yielded the
tetraazide 6 as an oil. Due to the general instability
of organic azides, 6 was not further characterized by 1H and 13C NMR analysis and directly applied in
the following reaction. The corresponding 1,3,5,7-tetraisocynatoadamantane
was generated by refluxing 6 in dichloroethane for 10
h. After removing the solvent, the tetrahydrochloride of 7 was generated by the addition of aqueous concentrated hydrochloric
acid. After 1 h under reflux conditions, the aqueous phase was removed
and the addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide resulted in crude 7. Sublimation of the solid at 200 °C and 5 mbar yielded
pure 7 with a good yield of 71% with respect to the carbonic
acid (4).

First
attempts to synthesize the desired final linker molecule 8 by the reaction of 7 with 2-bromoacetyl chloride,
2-bromoacetyl bromide, 2-chloroacetyl chloride, or 2-chloroacetyl
bromide in different solvents and under varying conditions failed.
One hypothesis for this is the possible formation of highly reactive
ketenes out of acyl halides bearing at least one hydrogen at the α-carbon
atom in the presence of amines.16 To overcome
this problem, the desired amide formation between the bromoacetic
acids and 7 was evaluated using different coupling reagents,
like HBTU, PyBOP, PyBroP, PyOxim, bases, and solvents. Among all tested
conditions, the reaction with PyOxim in dimethyl formamide as solvent
and diisopropylamine as a base gave the best yields for 8 with 39%. First, the 4.1-fold amount of the respective haloacetic
acid was activated for 20 min with an equimolar amount of PyOxim in
the presence of an excess diisopropylamine as a base. Subsequently,
the activated acid mixture was added to a suspension of 7 in dimethyl formamide. After a reaction time of 30 min, no further
starting material could be detected by TLC analysis. Longer reaction
times did not lead to significantly higher yields but to the formation
of additional side products. The use of more equivalents or a stepwise
addition of activated acid did not change the results. Subsequently,
the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C and directly purified
over a C8-modified reversed-phase silica column by using
a water/acetonitrile gradient. Product-containing fractions were directly
flash frozen and lyophilized yielding the desired compound 8 with an overall yield of approximately 12% with respect to adamantane
(1).

Development of the Two-Step Modification
Strategy
The
implementation of NATBA as a linker in phage display-based screening
of bicyclic peptides requires a selective and almost quantitative
chemical modification of the peptides presented by phages under physiological
conditions.6,8

It is crucial for the success of the
phage display to retain phage infectivity after peptide modification
and the variations of reaction conditions, like the choice of solvent,
pH, and temperature, are limited by phage stability. For the investigation
of the sulfhydryl reactivity of the newly synthesized linker NATBA,
we chose a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) controlled strategy for the optimization of the reaction
conditions. As a positive control, we monitored the reaction process
of the cyclization linker TBMB with the test peptide TPA (NH2-ACEGMINSCEKSDYECG-CONH2, 1839.1 Da) under reaction conditions
published by Heinis et al. (20 mM NH4CO3, 5
mM EDTA, pH 8, 30 °C) over time by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.9 In less than 5 min, the linear test peptide TPA
was almost quantitatively (>95%) cyclized to form the desired bicycle
peptide TPA-TBMB. However, the TPA-TBMB bicyclic peptide continued
to react with excess TBMB (1.5 equiv) upon extended reaction time
(>10 min) (Figure S2, Supporting Information).
The reaction of NATBA was investigated under varying reaction conditions.
Different buffers, pH values (6–8), acetonitrile concentrations,
and temperatures were tested. The best results were achieved using
a HEPES buffer at pH 8, 15% acetonitrile, and 30 °C (see Figure 1). At pH 6, the reaction
proceeded too slowly. After 1 h of reaction, about 50% conversion
could be detected. As expected, the reaction rate of NATBA increased
when choosing the pH values closer to the pKS of cysteine. At pH 7, the reaction was nearly completed after
30 min. This optimization process led to pH 8 for buffering and a
reaction time of less than 10 min.

Figure 1 Reaction of NATBA with test peptide TPA
(NH2-ACEGMINSCEKSDYECG-CONH2, 1839.1 Da) measured
by MALDI-TOF over a time of 60 min at
different pH. Reaction conditions: (A) 20 mM HEPES, 15% acetonitrile,
pH 8.0, 30 °C, 0.5 mM TPA, and 1.5 equiv NATBA. (B) 20 mM HEPES,
15% acetonitrile, pH 7.0, 30 °C, 0.5 mM TPA, and 1.5 equiv NATBA.
(C) 20 mM HEPES, 15% acetonitrile, pH 6.0, 30 °C, 0.5 mM TPA,
and 1.5 equiv NATBA. Molecular weight TPA-NATBA: 2276.4 Da. Annotation: Cross-linked, dimerized/trimerized, etc., peptides
using this protocol were not observed.

Thus, for the second reaction step, the respective additives
(FlcSH,
BiotinSH, cFΦR4, see Figure 2) were added after step 1 (reaction of test
peptide TPA with NATBA for 10 min at pH 8 and 30 °C using 20
mM HEPES and 15% acetonitrile). Dependent on the added molecule, the
reaction yielding the desired functionalized bicycle took between
30 and 60 min. The best overall conversions were achieved by using
1.05 equiv of NATBA and 1.0 equiv of respective additive minimizing
the formation of multiple conjugation products formed by excess of
additives or linker molecules. At the beginning of the development
phase, the approach to precouple NATBA (8) with a functionalization
molecule was also intended. However, the synthesis turned out to be
particularly difficult because the multicoupled byproducts are very
difficult to separate from the singly coupled product. Due to very
low yields, this approach was not pursued. It should be noted that
the reaction of a planar, trivalent linker such as TBMB with a peptide
with two variable cysteine-free sequences flanked by three cysteines
can only generate one single species of bicyclic peptides. In comparison
to that, the reaction between a tetravalent linker and a peptide of
the same type could result in two stereo isomers, most likely giving
a mixture of these two species. Starting from a peptide library of
the format CX6CX6C, where a fourth cysteine
can appear in any of the randomized amino acid positions (X), Chen
et al.17 generated a combinatorial library
of bicyclic peptides by oxidization of these four cysteines to two
pairs of cystines. During the selection process, a strong enrichment
of peptides with four cysteines was observed, yielding binders to
protein targets in the low micromolar range. This approach demonstrated
that also phage display of bicyclic peptides with two or even more
different possible regioisomers per phage (about five peptide copies
are displayed per phage9) is able to generate
potent peptide binders.17

Phage Affinity Selection of Functionalized
Peptides
The phage display-based methodology for the selection
of chemically
modified peptides developed by Heinis and Winter6,8 served
as a framework for the implementation of the newly developed two-step
tool kit concept. The phage library with a complexity of 8.8 ×
107 different clones presenting linear peptides of the
format ACX6CX6CG-phage (X = all natural occurring
amino acids except cysteine) was prepared with minor modifications
as described in the literature (see Supporting Information).9 In general, it has
to be assumed that after the preparation of the phages, the cysteine-rich
peptide library is partly oxidized. Therefore, it is essential to
reduce the potentially oxidized peptides before modification. Heinis
and co-workers have implemented this reduction of phages via tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP) into their protocol.7−9 This includes a stepwise dilution
procedure of the reducing agent by using centrifugal filters. We developed
a faster and more effective TCEP removal step by purifying the reduced
phages over a Sephadex desalting column. Subsequently, the linear
peptides were selectively modified by the two-step modification under
optimized conditions using NATBA as a linker and FlcSH as an additive.
The phage-encoded bicyclic peptide library was subjected to three
iterative rounds of affinity selection against the model target (rabbit
anti-goat IgG (H + L) Superclonal Secondary Antibody) using this modification
protocol. After each selection, the captured phages were eluted by
treatment with low pH buffer and rescued by infecting E. coli. After the third iterative round, individual
clones were selected and sequenced revealing the respective amino
acid sequences (see Figure 3A). We were pleased to find strong consensus motifs within
the resulting peptides sequences as a clear indication for target-specific
binding. Most of the similarities are found in the N-terminal part
of the first loop, consisting predominately of Leu, His, and Phe/Tyr.
In the second loop, the highest conserved position is likewise the
most N-terminal amino acid next to the central Cys, showing a strong
preference for polar or acidic residues (Ser, Asp, Gln). None of the
isolated sequences were found with an abundance higher than 3. This
may indicate that the affinities are in a similar range. To confirm
the affinity against the model target, a magnetic bead-based pulldown
experiment was performed. Six individual selected sequences representing
different sequence motifs were synthesized and functionalized with
BiotinSH (10). As a negative control, a sequence (JK38)
sharing no observable similarity to any of the chosen motifs was used.
The BiotinSH-functionalized peptides were captured by streptavidin
immobilized on magnetic beads (Figure 3B). After incubation with the target protein and five
washing cycles, each pulldown experiment was analyzed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Figure 3C). For all of the analyzed
sequences, except the negative control, the light and the heavy chain
of the rabbit anti-Goat IgG antibody was clearly detected as an indicator
of the successful capturing by the respective functionalized peptide.

50 kDa. The MW of the light chain is approx. 25 kDa. The band at 17
kDa represents the ubiquitously high levels of streptavidin (16.8
kDa) washed from the magnetic beads after the pulldown experiment.

Conclusions
We
were able to demonstrate that bicyclic peptides can efficiently
be formed and functionalized by different additives in two consecutive
reaction steps using the herein presented tetravalent linker NATBA
(8) and applying the optimized reaction conditions provided
in our protocol. Implementing this novel NATBA modification concept
into phage display, we could finally isolate functionalized bicyclic
peptides that bind recombinant rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody as a
model target. The successful capturing of the target protein in pulldown
experiments by six different selected peptides containing biotin suggests
furthermore that the spatial orientation of the functionalized peptide
construct might allow exchanges at the fourth position of the linker
without a complete loss of affinity. However, current data do not
allow a clear statement how far functionalization affects final affinity.
The synthesis of the sulfhydryl-reactive NATBA (8) described
here provides a general route toward the symmetric tetravalent linkers
that enables, in addition to the presented concept, also the generation
of globular tricyclic peptides. Further use of this approach is currently
under investigation. In summary, NATBA is the center of a tool kit
directly linking affinity selection by phage display to functionalization
of the bicycles within the selection process.

otherwise noted.

1,3,5,7-Tetrabromoadamantane (2)
This
reaction was performed with minor modifications as described in the
literature.20 A mixture of anhydrous aluminum
chloride (30 g, 0.23 mol) and bromine (15 mL, 0.39 mol) was cooled
to 0 °C. Adamantane (1) (7.5 g, 55.1 mmol) was added
carefully in small portions through a solid addition funnel. Subsequently,
the reaction mixture was slowly heated up and refluxed. HBr gas that
evolved was passed through a second flask containing concentrated
aqueous sodium bisulfite. When no more HBr gas evolved (about 10 h),
small portions of cooled saturated sodium bisulfite solution (100
mL) and aqueous HCl (4 N, 100 mL) were added to the reaction mixture
under intense cooling. The resulting dark yellow oily precipitate
was taken up in acetone (100 mL). To the resulting dark brown solution,
water was added in steps of 150 mL each to precipitate the brominated
adamantane. The resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography
on silica (eluent: n-hexane) yielding the desired
1,3,5,7-tetrabromoadamantane (2) as a light-brownish
solid. Recrystallization from acetone/water yielded the product with
a purity of 98%. Yield: 16.9 g, 68% (lit.: 61%20). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ:
2.64 (s, 12H) ppm. 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3)

1,3,5,7-Tetracyanoadamantane
(3)
1,3,5,7-Tetracyanoadamantane
(3) was prepared with minor modifications according procedures
described in the literature.20 1,3,5,7-Tetrabromoadamantane
(2) (2.14 g, 4.74 mmol) and sodium cyanide (3.69 g, 75.29
mmol) were dissolved in 150 mL degasified dimethyl sulfoxide in a
cylindrical quartz tube. The mixture was irradiated under argon at
254 nm for 6 h (150 W low-pressure mercury vapor lamp). After irradiation,
the solvent was removed by distillation at reduced pressure. The brownish
residue was washed with water (500 mL) and the solid precipitate was
filtered off. The filtrate was directly collected in a solution of
6% sodium hypochlorite. The crude product was purified by column chromatography
on silica. Unreacted starting material and partially cyanated products
were removed by dichloromethane. A mixture of dichloromethane/acetone
(1:4) served to elute the desired product. Recrystallization from
acetone/water yielded the desired 1,3,5,7-tetracyanoadamantane (3) as a light-brownish solid. Yield: 990 mg, 89% (lit.: 73%20). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 2.39 (s, 12H) ppm. 13C NMR (100
MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 54.8, 54.6, 120.9
ppm. Mp: >400 °C. HRMS-FAB: calc.: 236.27 [M + H+];

1,3,5,7-Tetracarboxyadamantane
(4)
1,3,5,7-Tetracyanoadamantane
(3, 990 mg, 4.19 mmol) was suspended in an aqueous sodium
hydroxide solution (15 wt %, 30 mL). The reaction mixture was heated
under stirring in a pressure tube at 135 °C for 6 h. The initially
suspended starting material dissolved within 3 h. After cooling to
room temperature, the slight brownish solution is acidified with concentrated
HCl. The precipitation of the product started immediately. After filtration
under reduced pressure, the colorless solid was redissolved in water
(20 mL) under dropwise addition of sodium hydroxide solution (0.1
M). After acidifying the solution using concentrated HCl to pH = 1,
the product was allowed to recrystallize at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently,
the light-brownish solid was filtered under reduced pressure and dried
at 100 °C for 10 h yielding 1,3,5,7-adamantanetetracarboxylic
acid (4) as light-brownish solid. Yield: 915 mg, 70%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ:
1.79 (s, 12H), 12.43 (s, 4H) ppm. 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 38.5, 40.8, 176.7 ppm.

1,3,5,7-Tetraaminoadamantane
(7)
A mixture
of 1,3,5,7-tetracarboxyadamantane (4) (495 mg, 1.58 mmol),
thionyl chloride (5 mL), and a catalytic amount of dimethyl formamide
(1 drop) was refluxed for 3 h. Within the first 1.5 h, the initially
suspended starting material dissolved. The thionyl chloride was removed
under heat (65 °C), stirring, and argon stream. Remaining dimethyl
formamide was removed under high vacuum, yielding adamantane-1,3,5,7-tetracarbonyl
tetrachloride (5) as a colorless solid in quantitative
yield (609 mg, 98%). To the remaining solid an ice-cold suspension
of sodium azide (616 mg, 9.48 mmol) in acetone (5 mL) was added under
stirring and cooling to 0 °C. After 10 min, the cooling bath
was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm up to room
temperature. After 2 h of stirring, the excess of insoluble sodium
azide and sodium chloride were filtered and the filtrate evaporated
under reduced pressure to yield adamantine-1,3,5,7-tetracarbonyl tetrazide
(6) as a red-brownish oil (529 mg, 81%). To the oil,
1,2-dichloroethane (15 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was
refluxed under stirring for 10 h. Subsequently, the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure and concentrated hydrochloric acid (20 mL)
was added to the light-brownish crude 1,3,5,7-tetraisocyanatoadamantane
and refluxed for 1 h. Then, the acidic aqueous phase was removed under
reduced pressure to yield 1,3,5,7-tetraaminoadamantane tetrahydrochloride
(433 mg, 80%). To the slightly brownish residue dissolved in water
(5 mL), sodium hydroxide (284 mg, 7.1 mmol) was added. Subsequently,
the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Sublimation of the
brownish crude solid product at 250 °C and 5 mbar yielded pure
1,3,5,7-tetraaminoadamantane (7) as a colorless solid.
Yield: 221 mg, 71%, colorless solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 1.12 (s, 12H) ppm. 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 50.7,
52.9 ppm.

(8)
To a suspension of 1,3,5,7-tetraaminoadamantane
(7) (50.6 mg, 0.26 mmol) in dry DMF (1 mL) was added
activated bromoacetic acid solution (2.5 mL) under stirring at room
temperature directly followed by dry N,N-diisopropylethylamine (221 mL, 1.30 mmol). The activated bromoacetic
acid solution was prepared as follows: to a solution of PyOxim (686.5
mg, 1.30 mmol) in dry DMF (2 mL) was added bromoacetic acid (180.7
mg, 1.30 mmol) under stirring at room temperature and stirred for
20 min. The suspended 1,3,5,7-tetraaminoadamantane (7) dissolves within 1 min after the addition of the activated bromoacetic
acid and N,N-diisopropylethylamine.
After 0.5 h of stirring, the crude reaction mixture was directly purified
in 1 mL steps over a C8-modified reversed-phase silica
column (PP-30C8/35G, 30 mm PP, 300, Interchim, France) by using the
following acetonitrile (ACN)/ddH20 gradient method: 0 min
−8% ACN, 20 min −25% ACN. Product peak is to be expected
at approx. 20% ACN. The product-containing fractions were directly
flash frozen and subsequently lyophilized. Yield: 68.5 mg, 39%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ:

product was precipitated by the addition of water (20 mL). After filtration,
the solid was washed twice with cold water (25 mL) and resuspended
in a mixture of methanol and water (8:2, 20 mL). Under stirring was
added tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (154.23 mg, 0.530 mmol). After
8 h of reaction at room temperature, the solvent was removed under
reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by silica column

Chemical Synthesis of Peptides
Peptides with free N-terminus
and amidated C-terminus were synthesized on a 50 μmol scale
by standard Fmoc solid-phase chemistry on an automated peptide synthesizer
(Syro I, MuliSynTech GmbH, Witten, Germany). After deprotection and
cleavage from the 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxymethyl
(Rink amide) resin (TentaGel HL RAM, RAPP Polymere, Tuebingen, Germany)
with trifluoroacetic acid (85 vol %, 5.5 wt % phenol, 4.5 vol % triisopropylsilane,
5 vol % H2O), the resulting deprotected peptides were precipitated
three times in cold diethylether (−20 °C). Subsequently,
the crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC (Interchim,
PuriFlash 4250) using a Reprosil100 column (C18, 5 μm,
20 × 250 mm2, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) and
a linear gradient elution with a mobile phase composed of eluent A
(99.9 vol % H2O and 0.1 vol % trifluoroacetic acid) and
eluent B (80 vol % acetronitrile, 20 vol % H2O, and 0.1
vol % trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. The molecular
masses were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics—autoflex
II, MA). Cyclization with NATBA: The peptide (1 mM) dissolved in 3
mL 70% buffer R (20 mM HEPES, pH 8)/30% acetonitrile was reacted with
1.1 equiv NATBA dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile under shaking at 30
°C. After 10 min, of reaction, 2 equiv of 10 dissolved
in 1 mL of 50% buffer R (20 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8)/50% acetonitrile
were added and the reaction was incubated under gentle shaking for
further 60 min at 30 °C. Chemically modified peptides were purified
as described above. The purity of the modified and unmodified peptides
were assessed by analytical RP-HPLC (Agilent 1100 system, Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), using a C18 column and
the same buffer system as for preparative RP-HPLC.

Peptide Cyclization
and Mass Spectrometric Analysis
Test peptides were dissolved
in the respective buffer system and
placed in a thermoshaker (Bioer Technology) at 30 °C. After 10
min of incubation, the respective amount (1.5 equiv) of linker dissolved
in a volume of 100 μL acetonitrile was added to 500 μL
test peptide solution (0.5 mM) under shaking. The progress of the
reaction was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at different
times (1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min). Taken samples were directly mixed
with the same volume of matrix solution (20 mg α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (α-CHCA) in 1 mL 50:50 H2O/ACN with 0.1% TFA
trifloroacetic acid (final conc.)), spotted on target plate and measured
by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics—autoflex II,
MA).

Preparation of the 6 × 6 Phage Library
The 6 ×
6 phage library that presents peptides of the format ACX6CX6G was generated with modifications as described in
the literature (see Supporting Information).9

Phage Selection of Functionalized
Modified Peptides
Phage display was performed with modifications
as described in the
literature.9E. coli TG1 glycerol stock cells containing the phage library were used
to inoculate 500 mL of 2xYT media containing 30 mg/mL until an OD600 of 0.1 was reached. After incubation for 16 h at 30 °C,
the E. coli TG1 cells were removed
from the phage-containing supernatant by centrifugation for 30 min
at 6000 rpm and 4 °C. The phages were precipitated by the addition
of 0.2 volume of precipitation buffer (PEG buffer, 20% PEG-6000, 2.5
M NaCl). After the addition of the PEG buffer, the phage suspension
was cooled on ice for 60 min and subsequently centrifuged for 30 min
at 7000 rpm and 4 °C. After careful removal of the supernatant,
the resulting phage pellets were resuspended in 10 mL ice-cold buffer
R (20 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8) and again centrifuged for 30 min
at 4000 rpm and 4 °C. The phage-containing supernatant was carefully
transferred into a new 50 mL falcon tube. To the clear phage solution
was added TCEP with a final concentration of 1 mM and the reduction
was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. To remove TCEP, the reduced phage
solution was purified twice over a desalting column (HiPrep 26/10
Desalting, GE Healthcare). The resulting phage-containing fraction
was adjusted to 32 mL with buffer R and 4 mL of 100 mM NATBA solution
in acetonitrile was added to obtain a final linker concentration of
11.11 μM/L and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min under gentle
shaking followed by the direct addition of 4 mL 500 μM FlcSH
(9) in a mixture of 50% acetonitrile/H2O and
further incubation at 30 °C for 1 h. The chemically modified
phages were subsequently precipitated by the addition of 0.2 volume
of buffer PEG, cooled down on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 4700
rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The phage pellet was dissolved in 3 mL
buffer W1 (10 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). Biotinylated Rabbit anti-Goat IgG
(H + L) Superclonal Secondary Antibody (ThermoFischer) was immobilized
on magnetic streptavidin beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, Invitrogen)
following the protocol provided in the Supporting Information. Negative control without the antigen was prepared
by addition of buffer W1 instead of antigen. Subsequently, the magnetic
beads were washed three times with 0.5 mL buffer W1 and incubated
for 30 min at room temperature in 300 mL buffer W1 supplemented with
150 mL buffer W2 (buffer W1 + 3% BSA, 0.3% Tween 50). During that
step, the chemically modified phages, stored in 3 mL buffer W1, were
blocked at room temperature by the addition of 1.5 mL buffer W2 for
30 min. The blocked bead suspension (0.45 mL) and 2.25 mL of the blocked
phage suspension were mixed together and incubated for 30 min on a
rotating wheel at room temperature. Same was performed for the negative
control. The beads were washed eight times with buffer W3 (buffer
W1 + 0.1% Tween 50) and twice with buffer W1. The phages were eluted
by incubation with 100 μL of buffer E (50 mM gylcine, pH 2)
for exactly 5 min and then directly transferred into 50 μL of
buffer N (1 M Tris, pH 8) for neutralization. The eluted phages were
added to 25 mL of E. coli TG1 cells
at OD600 of 0.4 for 90 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation
for 5 min at 4000 rpm and 4 °C, the cell pellets of positive
and negative experiments were plated on each two large 2xTY/chloramphenicol
(30 mg/mL) plates. For each round, the input and output phage titers
were determined. Second and third rounds of panning were performed
following the same procedure but using in the second round instead
of streptavidin beads neutravidin-coated magnetic beads. Magnetic
neutravidin beads were prepared by reacting 1 mg neutravidin (Pierce)
with 0.5 mL tosyl-activated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Tosyl-activated,
Invitrogen) according to the supplier’s instructions. After
the second and third round of selections, individual clones were picked
and amplified. The extracted plasmid DNA of each clone was sequenced
using primer seqba (Eurofins, Germany).

Pulldown Assay
Individual selected peptide sequences
were synthesized and functionalized with NATBA as a linker and BiotinSH
(10) as an additive. The required amount of magnetic
streptavidine beads (250 mg per sample) was washed three times with
1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and spitted into the respective
number of experiments. After adding to each sample 1 mg of the respective
NATBA–BiotinSH (10) functionalized peptide dissolved
in a minimum amount of PBS, the bead suspension was incubated for
15 min at room temperature on a wheel shaker. Subsequently, the suspension
was washed five times with each 1 mL PBS and transferred into new
1.5 mL tubes. To each sample, 2 μL of rabbit anti-goat IgG (H
+ L) Superclonal Secondary Antibody (1 mg/mL, ThermoFischer) was added.
After incubation for 1 h at room temperature on a wheel shaker, the
bead suspension was washed five times with each 1 mL PBS and transferred
into new 1.5 mL tubes. Washed beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
