Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based
on a NiOx hole transport layer (HTL) with
an inverted p–i–n
configuration have yielded highly efficient and relatively stable
devices. Here, we develop a simple electrochemical deposition method
for quickly and evenly preparing a mesoporous NiOx film. It is demonstrated that the increasing thickness
and decreasing surface roughness of the NiOx film are beneficial for light transmission. The optimal condition
for preparing NiOx films is achieved by
adjusting the deposition time at a certain applied current density,
which exhibits excellent optical transmittance and suitable thickness
and band gap, thus reducing optical loss and enhancing hole extraction
at the interface between HTL and the perovskite layer and therefore
improving photovoltaic performances. The finite-difference time-domain
simulation confirms the optimal thickness of the NiOx layer and coincides with our experiment results. An optimal
power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.77% with an active area of
0.25 cm2 is achieved. The prepared device shows negligible
hysteresis, high reproducibility, and high uniformity with a PCE difference
of 2% for measuring the different sites from edge to center. This
simple fabrication process paves a novel way to the evolution of PSCs
based on NiOx and rapid commercialization.

Introduction
The
organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted
much attention due to their optimal band gap (≈1.5 eV),1 large charge carrier mobility (33 and 115 cm2 V–1 s–1 for microcrystalline
thin films and single crystal, respectively),2−4 long electron–hole
diffusion length (>1 μm for microcrystalline films and >175
μm for single crystal),5,6 long carrier lifetimes
(>250 ns),7 and low exciton-binding
energy
(≈2 meV).8 Besides, the simple fabrication
process and low cost make it suitable for commercial applications
competing with silicon-based solar cells.9,10 Although
its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) was very low (4%) in
2009,11 the rapid increase astonished researchers
after only a decade’s development, with the highest PCE incredibly
reaching 23.3% in 2018.12 The inverted
planar heterojunction PSCs with a p–i–n configuration
have been demonstrated to show excellent performances, such as simple
fabrication process, low hysteresis, and high stability.13−16

Recently, inorganic metal oxides performing p-type semiconductor
property, such as Cu2O,17 CoOx,18 NiOx,19 and MoO3,20 have been studied as a hole transport
layer (HTL) to replace poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
and its modifications because these organic materials are always expensive
and show high instability to air, moisture, and temperature.21,22 Among them, nickel oxide (NiOx) exhibits
great potential due to its wide band gap for light penetration, appropriate
valence band edge exactly aligning with that of perovskite to allow
for efficient hole transport, and high carrier mobility for rapid
extraction and transport of carriers,21,23 thus leading
to high open circuit voltage (VOC). Besides,
NiOx is a low-cost material with superior
thermal and chemical stabilities due to its inorganic nature, which
brings about a longer device lifetime.24−26 To date, research on
PSCs using NiOx as HTL have made great
progress, and NiOx can be prepared by
various methods (Table S1). Spin-coating
is the most commonly used method because of the simple operation approach.27 For example, Yang et al.23 fabricated NiOx-based PSCs
and achieved uncertified maximum PCE value of 16.1% by synthesizing
NiOx precursor solution and then spin-coating
and postannealing. However, the solution-derived spin-coating method
is time consuming,28,29 relatively complicated for preparing
the NiOx precursor, and needs very high
temperature (>400 °C) for annealing after spin-coating.30 Furthermore, the spin-coating process results
in great waste of precursor solution, and it is not easy to uniformly
cover the transparent conductive substrate unless the NiOx layer is thick enough.31 In this case, the high resistance between the perovskite layer and
the transparent electrode could block the transportation of carriers,
negatively affecting the performance of PSCs.32 Other methods, such as magnetron sputtering,33 pulse laser deposition,34 and
atomic-layer deposition (ALD),35 are wasteful
of raw materials, time consuming, costly to process, and not suitable
for large-scale fabrication.

Electrochemical deposition (ECD)
is always used to fabricate the
covering layer for macroscopic components and micro devices. Compared
with the spin-coating method, the thickness of the NiOx film prepared by the ECD method can be easily controlled
by regulating the deposition time and applied current density. Besides,
a uniform film with a large area can be obtained, thus significantly
reducing the possibility of direct contact between the perovskite
layer and the transparent conductive layer. In addition, this method
is environment-friendly and suitable for mass production. This treatment
does not lead to the production of waste and significantly reduces
fabrication costs. Kim et al.36 showed
that using the ECD method for preparing NiOx films resulted in much improved uniformity for devices and realized
PCE value of 17.0% for large area (∼1.084 cm2) and
19.2% for small area (∼0.1 cm2) after introducing
an extremely thin polyethylenimine ethoxylated layer. However, several
fundamental questions remain unanswered. For example, it is not clear
whether the optical transmittance will be influenced by morphology
of the NiOx film after long-time deposition,
which will limit the light absorption for the perovskite layer. Moreover,
there has been no investigation on the effect of thickness and surface
roughness of the electrochemically deposited NiOx film on the role of grain size, grain boundary, and the
interface quality of perovskite thin films grown on top of NiOx HTL, which are critical for both performance
and stability.37

In this paper, we
focus on the morphology effect of the mesoporous
NiOx film on the performances of PSCs
with a structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/NiOx/MAPbI3/phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag, in which the NiOx film is prepared by using the ECD method, and
its thickness was accurately controlled by adjusting deposition time
at constant current density. We report that the optical transmittance
of the NiOx film abnormally increases
in the visible range with increasing time during the ECD process.
A detailed research on the effect of the thickness and surface roughness
of the NiOx film on photovoltaic performance
of fabricated PSCs is conducted. By optimizing the ECD process and
the interfaces between each layer, a promising PCE of 17.77% at an
active area of 0.25 cm2 without obvious hysteresis is achieved,
which is comparable to the best-in-class PSCs using NiOx HTL prepared by spin-coating,38 ALD,35 or sputtering.39 The fabricated PSCs exhibit high uniformity
with a small difference of 2% when measuring three different positions
of a typical device. Further simulation based on finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) analysis gives reasonable results and verifies
that the thickness of the NiOx film has
effect on PSC performances, which conforms to our experimental conclusion.
This work provides a new angle of view and a meaningful reference
to fabricate high-efficiency inverted PSCs based on electrochemically
deposited NiOx films.

Results and Discussion
The p-type NiOx layer was deposited
on the cleaned FTO/glass substrate via applying constant current density
of 0.1 mA cm–2 and subsequent annealing at 300 °C
for 2 h, as illustrated in Figure 1. In step 1, the Ni(OH)2 film was first
deposited on the FTO substrate; the electrochemical reactions on the
FTO surface could be expressed by eqs 1 and 2. In step 2, the device
was transferred into a muffle furnace for thermal annealing, and this
process could be explained by eq 3, and finally the mesoporous NiOx film was obtained. The real sample pictures and the corresponding
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images can also be seen from Figure 1, which indicates
the formation of the NiOx film from an
initially semitransparent surface to a finally transparent surface
through the thermal annealing process. 1   2   3  The morphology of the prepared NiOx film was examined by SEM and atomic force microscopy
(AFM). As can be seen from the top-view SEM images of Figure 2, the FTO nanograins are totally
covered by the mesoporous NiOx film, and
they become much denser with increasing deposition time. As shown
in the insets of Figure 2a–d, the measured average thicknesses of the NiOx film according to the cross-sectional SEM images
are 18, 54, 71, and 87 nm for different deposition times of 60, 90,
120, and 150 s, respectively. Note that the morphology of the NiOx film is affected by the FTO underneath due
to its rough pristine surface, and the deposited NiOx film seems smoother through longer deposition time according
to the cross-sectional SEM images. The NiOx film prepared through the ECD method exhibits very high uniformity;
the SEM images are shown in Figure S2.
The mesoporous morphology of the NiOx film
is beneficial for filling of perovskite into the nanoporous pore and
conformal surface coverage during its deposition process,40 thus preventing direct contact between the electron
transport layer (PCBM) and HTL (NiOx).
Besides, the thin overlayer capping of perovskite on the mesoporous
NiOx film is advantageous for acquiring
higher VOC.

substrate.

the corresponding cross-sectional images.

Figure 3a–e
illustrates three-dimensional (3D) AFM images of the pristine FTO/glass
substrate and NiOx films. Note that the
surface of pristine FTO is quite rugged with a root-mean-square (RMS)
roughness of 14.3 nm (Figure 3a). Interestingly, as shown in Figure 3b–e, the RMS roughness decreases after
electrochemically depositing the NiOx film
on the FTO/glass substrate; more remarkable, it decreases almost linearly
with deposition time. This phenomenon is consistent with the result
mentioned above in Figure 2. Figure 3f
summarizes the dependence of NiOx thin
film’s thickness and roughness on deposition time according
to Figures 2a–d
and 3b–e. The thickness of the deposited
NiOx film almost linearly increases with
deposition time, whereas the surface roughness unusually decreases.
This could be ascribed to the filling effect, where the pits on the
surface of pristine FTO are gradually filled by the deposited thin
NiOx film.

are 14.3, 13.8, 12.9, 10.9, and 9.7 nm, respectively. (f) Dependence
of the NiOx thin film’s thickness
and roughness on deposition time.

The optical properties of the deposited NiOx films with different deposition times were determined with
UV–vis absorption spectra, as shown in Figure 4a. As a reference, the optical transmittance
of the bare FTO/glass substrate was also measured. Both bare FTO and
NiOx films show high transmittance (>80%)
over the entire visible wavelength range. Further, the transmittance
of the FTO/glass substrate with the deposited NiOx film (labeled as FTO/NiOx)
is larger than that of the bare FTO/glass substrate (labeled as FTO),
and the transmittance dramatically increases with increasing deposition
time. This result seems totally different from the previous reports
showing negligible effect on the optical properties of the NiOx layer spin-coated on the transparent conductive
substrate.30,35,41 This can be explained by the fact that the NiOx films reported in previous studies were relatively compact
because of the preparation method such as ALD, magnetic sputtering,
spin-coating, and so on; therefore, the light was hindered when passing
through the thicker NiOx film. In our
experiment, the thin NiOx film prepared
by the ECD method is mesoporous, and the incident light cannot be
effectively reflected; meanwhile, the thicker mesoporous NiOx film with increasing deposition time reduces
surface roughness as mentioned above, thus decreasing the possibility
of incident light being trapped in the pits of the substrate. As a
result, the transmittance gradually enhances with the increasing thickness
of NiOx HTL. This is highly desirable
for photovoltaic devices as it generally leads to enhanced light-harvesting
capability of the perovskite layer.

substrate. (d) Tauc plot for the NiOx film
electrochemically deposited on FTO/glass substrate, showing that the
band gap of NiOx is 3.66 eV.

Figure 4b shows
XRD patterns of the pristine FTO/glass substrate and electrochemically
deposited NiOx film (50 nm in thickness)
on the substrate. As displayed, the XRD pattern of the NiOx film exhibits weak peaks compared with the
pristine FTO, whereas the small diffraction peaks at 37.2 and 43.3°
match very well with that of the cubic Fm3m crystal structure of NiOx (PDF#
47-1049), which can be assigned to the (111) and (200) planes. Figure 4c displays XPS spectra
of the Ni 2p3/2 core level, and they are consistent with
the previous reports.35,38 Three distinct peaks can be separated
from the XPS spectrum: the peak at 853.8 eV is ascribed to Ni2+, indicating the existence of NiO in the prepared film; the
peak at 855.5 eV should be ascribed to Ni3+, indicating
the existence of Ni2O3; and the broad peak at
860.9 eV is ascribed to the shakeup process of the NiO structure according
to the literature.23,42 Therefore, the prepared film
in this paper is noted as NiOx rather
than barely NiO or Ni2O3. Furthermore, we have
derived the optical band gap of the samples from the Tauc plots in Figure 4d, in which (αhν)2 is plotted as a function of hν from the absorption spectra, with α, h, and ν representing the absorption coefficient,
Planck constant, and light frequency, respectively.43 The calculated optical band gap of the NiOx film is 3.66 eV, which corresponds closely to the
value reported in previous literature.32,35,44

Figure 5a–e
exhibits the top view of SEM images of the prepared CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) films deposited
on NiOx mesoporous films fabricated by
the ECD method with different deposition times from 0 to 150 s, indicating
that the compact perovskite completely covers the mesoporous NiOx film underneath without visible pinholes. The
deposition time of 0 s means that the perovskite layer was directly
coated on the FTO/glass substrate without NiOx HTL. Even though the difference of average grain size is not significant
for different deposition times from the statistic distribution diagram
of perovskite grain size, illustrated in Figure 5f, it is evident that the largest average
grain size of about 320 nm is obtained at the deposition time of 90
s for the prepared NiOx film. The improved
crystallization of the perovskite layer based on NiOx at optimal deposition condition helps reduce carrier recombination
and improve the photocurrent of PSCs.45 The schematic diagram of the device structure is shown in Figure 5g, which is in accordance
with the cross-sectional SEM image of a completed solar cell shown
in Figure 5h. It is
clear that the light-harvester layer is composed of compact perovskite
grains with a uniform stacking structure, and the perovskite layer
closely contacts the hole and electron transport layers. The energy
band diagram for the device structure of the prepared inverted planar
PSCs based on NiOx films is described
in Figure 5i. Here
PCBM and BCP work as the electron transport layer and the hole isolation
layer, respectively.

The photovoltaic performance
of the prepared PSCs based on NiOx HTL
with different deposition times is illustrated
in Figure 6a and listed
in Table 1. The J–V curves were characterized under
AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm–2), and the
scan rate was set to 100 mV s–1. It is clearly seen
that the control device without the electrochemically depositing NiOx layer exhibits a PCE of only 3.64%, with a VOC of 0.705 V, a short-circuit current density
(JSC) of 14.31 mA cm–2, and a fill factor (FF) of 36.07%. However, employing NiOx HTL can significantly improve the performance
of the PSC device, resulting in an optimal PCE of 16.18, 17.77, 16.34,
and 14.68% for the NiOx layer with different
deposition times of 60, 90, 120, and 150 s, respectively. To examine
the photocurrent difference of the fabricated solar cell based on
NiOx HTL and bare FTO, the incident photon-to-current
efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured, as shown in Figure 6b. The IPCE in the whole visible
region is significantly enhanced after applying NiOx HTL. The integrated current densities calculated from IPCE
spectra are well consistent with the measured JSC illustrated in Figure 6a. For better understanding the electrical performance
affected by NiOx HTL, the distributions
of PCE, FF, JSC, and VOC are summarized in Figure 6c. The statistical results are obtained from
40 devices and show relatively small error bars, indicating high uniformity
of the fabricated PSCs. The average VOC of the prepared PSCs slightly increases from ∼1.00 to ∼1.01
V and then remains stable with the increasing deposition time of NiOx HTL. As shown in Figure 2f, the surface roughness of the deposited
NiOx film decreases with increasing deposition
time, which leads to higher shunt resistance (Rsh) and stronger ability of blocking electron transport, and
eventually increases VOC.23Rsh of the PSCs calculated
from the J–V curves actually
increases from 7.5 to 13.4 kΩ cm2 with the deposition
time increasing from 60 to 150 s. However, the increased thickness
of NiOx HTL will lead to the increase
of series resistance Rs, which can largely
hamper JSC and FF, for example, on increasing
the deposition time from 90 to 150 s, JSC and FF reduce from 21.55 mA cm–2 and 81.34% to
20.24 mA cm–2 and 71.59%, respectively. This is
probably due to the increased recombination of dissociated carriers
and a higher resultant series resistance because of holes traveling
a longer distance to reach the FTO electrode.32

The
optimal PSC was prepared by electrodepositing NiOx HTL for 90 s, and its electrical performance is
shown in Figure 7a.
The measurement was implemented at room temperature and humidity of
60% with scan rate of 100 mV s–1. It demonstrates
a high conversion efficiency of 17.47% in forward scan with a JSC of 21.36 mA cm–2, a VOC of 1.011 V, and an FF of 80.93%; and a PCE
of 17.77% in reversed scan with a JSC of
21.55 mA cm–2, a VOC of 1.014 V, and an FF of 81.34%. The PCE difference between the
forward and reverse scans is much smaller than 0.1% in absolute PCE
values, exhibiting negligible hysteresis. Although several possible
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of hysteresis,
including ferroelectric effect,46 ionic
displacement,47 charge accumulation at
interfaces,48 defects in the perovskite,49 and so on, the physical origin of hysteresis
has not been clearly pointed out. In our case, the efficient hole
extraction ability of NiOx HTL and high
quality of the perovskite film should be the two most important reasons
for the negligible hysteresis behaviors of our devices due to suitable
thickness of NiOx and good interface contact,
which are probably ascribed to better control capacity of the ECD
method and the mesoporous morphology of NiOx.50 Some studies reported that the electrical
property of the PSCs could be affected by changing the scan rate during
the measurement process,51 whereas in this
paper, as shown in Figure S2, the J–V curves almost overlap in the
whole range of scan voltage with different scan rates at 50, 100,
200, and 300 mV s–1. Output uniformity of the photovoltaic
performance is essential for achieving a highly efficient large-area
device. Figure 7b shows
the J–V curves tested at
different positions corresponding to the three electrodes in the lower
inset. The curves almost overlap each other with a negligible discrepancy,
and the detailed parameters are listed in the upper inset. The three
positions exhibit very even PCE performances (17.54% for A, 17.77%
for B, and 17.41% for C) with a small difference of 2%, demonstrating
excellent uniformity of the prepared PSCs. Figure 7c illustrates the PCE distribution based
on NiOx HTL electrochemically deposited
for 90 s with applying constant current density of 0.1 mA cm–2. The majority of PCE values are located in the range of ∼16.7%,
which is consistent with the above result shown in Figure 6c and Table 1.

stability of the prepared device.

Stability of PSCs has become a pivotal issue for commercial
application.
In this regard, we further examined the long-term stability of our
NiOx-based PSCs. The unencapsulated PSC
devices were measured at room temperature with humidity of 60% and
stored in a glovebox filled with nitrogen after each measurement and
characterization. The degradation trends of normalized photovoltaic
parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) are shown in Figure 7d. The fabricated devices demonstrate good
stability over a period of 40 days and maintain 80.5% of their initial
efficiency. It is noteworthy that two other parameters, JSC and VOC, do not decline
too much; the maximum degradation of PCE comes from the reduction
of FF due to interfacial degradation.23,44 We also notice
that the measuring pins of the test fixture stab on the perovskite
absorber through pierced silver electrodes after multiple repeated
measurements, which also finally causes degradation in FF and PCE.

To further validate the impact of prepared NiOx thickness on the performance of the inverted p–i–n
configuration perovskite solar cells theoretically, we used the computer
simulation package of Lumerical’s optical simulation software
of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solutions 2017a and electrical
simulation solver of DEVICE 2015a to simulate detailed photovoltaic
parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE). The simulation was based on four basic types
of recombination: radiative, Auger, Shockley–Read–Hall,
and surface recombination. A two-dimensional (2D) modular numerical
simulation was carried out by two steps due to the device structure
and software configuration features. The first step was to obtain
the electron–hole pair generation rate inside the considered
device based on 2D Maxwell’s equations. The standard AM 1.5G
spectrum was introduced as the incident light source, and the refractive
index (n, k) of each layer of the
PSC structure was referenced from previous literature.52−56

Furthermore, the photogenerated carrier rate extracted from
the
optical calculation was employed for the exact electrical characteristic
calculations based on drift-diffusion models, in which five layers
of BCP, n-type PCBM, MAPbI3, p-type NiOx, and FTO were considered. The basic parameters of materials,
such as thickness, shunt, and series resistance, come from experimental
data, and other electrical parameters, for instance, band gap, carrier
mobility, carrier lifetime, and so on, are referenced from the literature,54,55,57 which are all listed in Table S2. Here, Eg is band-gap energy; εr is relative permittivity;
χ is electron affinity; NA and ND denote acceptor and donor densities, respectively; NC and NV are effective
state density of conduction and valence bands, respectively; and μn and μp are mobilities of electron and hole,
respectively. τn and τp are the
lifetimes of electron and hole for trap-assisted recombination, respectively.

The simulated J–V curves
shown in Figure 8a
indicate that the performance of NiOx-based
PSCs is highly affected by the thickness of NiOx HTL. The optimal thickness of the NiOx layer is around 60 nm, as shown in Figure 8b; this matched well with our experimental
result. The photovoltaic parameters, especially VOC and PCE from the simulation results, are much higher
than those in our experiment. This is mainly because the simulation
process is executed only in terms of the electrical parameters listed
in Table S2, but ignoring the interface
defects, material impurity, humidity, temperature, and so on. The
light intensity in the interior of the prepared PSC device with a
60 nm-thick NiOx layer is shown in Figure 8c, demonstrating
that incident light is efficiently coupled into the perovskite layer
by optical resonance and light scattering provided by the mesoporous
NiOx film. The simulation results indicate
that there is much more room for improvement of NiOx-based PSC performance. We believe that the PCE of NiOx-based PSC can be very probably enhanced over
20% by further optimizing the preparation process of the NiOx layer and reducing the contact resistance and
defects at interfaces between each layer.

Conclusions
In summary, mesoporous NiOx films with
different thicknesses and surface roughness have been successfully
deposited on FTO/glass substrates by the ECD process. The as-prepared
NiOx films exhibit high optical transmittance
in the visible range with a band gap of 3.66 eV and show higher transmittance
with the increasing deposition time at constant current density. The
thickness and surface roughness of the NiOx layer deposited with different duration times are found to affect
the JSC and FF without significantly attenuating
the VOC. As a result, an optimized efficient
inverted planar heterojunction PSC with a structure of FTO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag is fabricated, exhibiting an optimal PCE of 17.77% with
an active area of 0.25 cm2. The devices show high uniformity
and stability without obvious hysteresis. The simulation results coincide
with experimental results and prove that incident light is efficiently
coupled into the light-harvester layer through the mesoporous NiOx layer. This study opens a new way for preparing
high-quality NiOx HTL, and further investigation
is necessary to improve JSC and VOC for high-performance PSCs.

Preparation of the NiOx Film
NiOx film was
prepared by the electrochemical
deposition method and then a thermal annealing process. In brief,
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mMol) was dissolved
in 100 mL of deionized water with magnetic stirring until a light-green
solution was obtained. The cleaned FTO/glass substrate was connected
to the cathode of the electrochemical workstation, whereas the nickel
foil with the same shape was connected to the anode. A thin layer
of Ni(OH)2 was first obtained by applying a stable current
density (0.1 mA cm–2) between the working electrode
(FTO/glass) and the counter electrode (nickel foil). The thickness
of Ni(OH)2 was precisely controlled by adjusting the electrodeposition
time. The NiOx film was finally obtained
by annealing the prepared sample in a muffle furnace (Thermolyne,
Thermo Scientific) at 300 °C for 2 h.

Fabrication of PSCs
The patterned FTO/glass substrate
was cleaned with detergent mixed in deionized water, isopropanol,
and ethanol sequentially by sonication for 15 min. The cleaned FTO/glass
substrate was dried by blowing nitrogen and treated by ultraviolet-ozone
for 20 min. An approximate 50 nm-thick NiOx film was deposited on the FTO/glass substrate by the previously
described method. Thereafter, the substrate was transferred into a
glovebox filled with nitrogen for coating the perovskite layer by
a one-step method. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared
by dissolving 1 mMol PbI2 and 1 mMol CH3NH3I in DMSO (0.3 mL) and GBL (0.7 mL). The spin-coating process
for the perovskite precursor solution was set to run at 500 rpm for
12 s and then 4000 rpm for 30 s. After spinning for 20 s of the second
spinning process, 100 μL of anhydrous chlorobenzene was rapidly
dropped on top of the substrate. The substrates were heated in a muffle
furnace at 100 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, PCBM solution (dissolved
in chlorobenzene of 20 mg mL–1) and BCP solution
(0.5 mg mL–1 in isopropanol) were spun onto the
perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s, respectively.
Each prepared solution was filtered through poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
filters (0.45 μm) before the spin-coating process. Finally,
a 120 nm-thick silver layer was deposited using thermal evaporation
(PECVD350, Shenyang Xinlantian vacuum technology Co., Ltd, China)
and a shadow mask. The active area of the prepared solar cell device
is 0.25 cm2.

Film and PSC Characterization
Scanning
electron microscopy
(SEM, Carl Zeiss, Germany) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nanoscope
IIIa Multimode) were employed to characterize the morphology of the
deposited NiOx film and prepared perovskite
solar cells. Further, the structure of NiOx HTL was confirmed via X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Germany).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS UltraDLD, Japan) was used
to analyze the elemental composition of the NiOx film. Optical transmission spectra of the samples were
collected by a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (LAMBDA750,
PerkinElmer). Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by using Keithley
2400 SourceMeter under a standard 1 sun AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport,
2612A), which was calibrated by a silicon reference cell under a light
intensity of 100 mW cm–2. J–V curves were measured by means of reverse (from 1.2 to
−0.2 V) or forward (from −0.2 to 1.2 V) scanning at
room temperature with scan rate of 100 mV s–1 and
relative humidity of 60%. The incident photon to current efficiency
(IPCE) of the fabricated PSCs was characterized using a quantum efficiency
measurement system (QEX10, PV measurements).
