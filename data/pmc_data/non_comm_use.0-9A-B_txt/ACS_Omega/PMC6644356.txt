“Side chain
engineering” research has yielded many
promising and beneficial results, with applications in various fields.
However, this research did not receive sufficient focus when nature-sourced
polymers are concerned. In this study, we have performed side chain
engineering on chitosan, a nature-sourced polysaccharide, by coupling
it with a number of aliphatic aldehydes of varying chain lengths.
The side chains’ length and the pursuing effect on the modified
products’ properties were studied in great detail. In terms
of coupling yields, it was found that some substituents have displayed
more favorable results than others by a factor of over 35 times. When
studying the modified polymers’ physical and mechanical properties,
some of them were found to exhibit more rigid mechanical properties
by a factor of 3.5 times than others. The effect was also expressed
through self-assembly concentrations and encapsulation capabilities
of the modified polymers. Remarkably, the combined experimental and
calculated kinetic studies showed the results do not necessarily follow
a linear progression relating to substituent chain length, but rather
a parabolic pattern with a specific extremum point. This study has
assisted in shedding light on the inspected phenomenon, explaining
that not only steric and electronic factors but also interfacial solubility
related factors govern the coupling reaction and the resulting modified
polymers’ properties. As chemical protocols in various academic,
clinical, and industrial studies around the world slowly shift their
norms toward finding safer ways for the production of novel materials
and technologies, nature-sourced polymers hold great promise as virtually
inexhaustible raw materials. The perfection of their chemical modification
is therefore relevant now more than ever, with far-reaching and diverse
applicative prospects.

Introduction
Modifying a chemical
substrate with substituents of different lengths
and the ensuing effect has always intrigued scientists. Dating back
to classic mechanistic organic studies,1,2 all through
recent novel research fields,3−5 the change in substituent chain
length was found to have a noticeable, guiding, and important effect
on product outcome, properties, and use. This influence on the properties
of new materials can be collected under the overarching theme of “side
chain engineering”.6 Although this
theme includes many beneficial studies and applications in varied
fields such as electrochemistry,7−9 photochemistry,10,11 and other investigations of polymeric materials,6,12−14 it is predominantly focused on synthetic polymers.
Surprisingly, a similar investigation of the side chain engineering
strategy in nature-sourced polymers and the ensuing possibilities
is practically unexplored.15 Rationally
designed modified natural polymers are of significant importance because
functional biocompatible materials are highly desired in current medical,
pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food, and agricultural practices as biodegradable
packages and coatings, active hydrogels, and, especially, new-generation
delivery systems.16

Polysaccharide-based
polymers have gained specific recent attention
due to their many practical applications as flexible, biodegradable,
and biocompatible materials.17,18 They have well-defined
monomeric units and were therefore extensively studied from a synthetic
modulation perspective. Chitosan (CS) is at the forefront of this
family as a nature-sourced polysaccharide due to its low-toxicity
and variable biomedical activities.19,20 It consists
of β-(1-4)-linked d-glucosamine (deacetylated units)
and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (acetylated units).
It has been examined and proposed for numerous applications in drug
delivery, tissue engineering, food, cosmetics, and environmental uses.21,22 From a synthetic standpoint, CS is especially attractive due to
the presence of repeating NH2 groups at its C3 position
that allows various modifications. Specifically, an N-imine Schiff
base can be fashioned by coupling CS’s amines with aldehyde
substituents possessing alkyl chains of varying lengths in an N-imination
reaction.23,24

The current study seeks to understand
the influence of substituents
of certain chain lengths on the properties of modified nature-sourced
polysaccharides during their conversion into biocompatible applicative
nanoparticles. Understanding the fundamental reason for the side chain
effect in biopolymers and its expression through interfacial nanoparticle
dynamics as diverse physical properties is paramount due to recent
shifts in common industrial and academic practices that slowly move
toward the production and study of nature-sourced materials. The effect
was addressed in terms of modified product yields, self-assembly,
encapsulation abilities, and physical and mechanical properties. Results
were studied experimentally and aided by a calculated kinetic model.
This type of synthetic strategy can eventually help to elevate natural
polymers to the degree where synthetic polymers are currently at,
with applicative technologies that will follow suit, promoting their
use as advanced biocompatible materials in various uses.

Results and Discussion
A series of aliphatic aldehydes (3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 carbons
long) was systematically coupled to chitosan (CS) in water as a solvent
using an N-imine Schiff base dynamic covalent bond approach to form
N-alkyliminated CS derivatives, termed CS-n (n = 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, respectively) (Scheme 1). CS’s molecular weight
and polydispersity index were determined as 59 826 g/mol and
3.66 Mw/Mn, respectively, using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Two additional
double bond-containing aldehydes, trans-2-hexenal
(with an α–β double-bond system nearest to CS’s
C2) and 11-undecenal (with an ω double bond at the farthest
possible position to chitosan’s C2), were also inspected to
understand the effect of double bond as well as its location on a
particular side chain (termed CS-6′ and CS-11′, respectively).

Scheme 1 Preparation of N-Alkyliminated CS Derivatives
Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform
infrared (ATR-FTIR)
scans (Figure 1) verified
successful polymer N-imination. A repetitive frequency displacement
from the original amine (1641 cm–1) to an N-imine
(1637 cm–1) was observed in all of the derivatives.
No traces of aldehyde carbonyl residues (1720–1740 cm–1) were observed in the isolated products. New carbohydrate bands
have appeared, indicating coupled aliphatic moieties (720–740
cm–1).

CS derivatives. CS-12 was not investigated using XRD due to its brittle
form, which prohibited procuring a valid film sample. This image had
been amended as requested by the reviewer, with specific alterations
detailed in the cover letter.

The XRD scans have shown that the original CS gave a 2ϑ
peak
at 15°, corresponding to previously reported values.25 The 2ϑ values of the modified polymers
were slightly decreased because lattice spacing increases due to aldehyde
coupling. Aldehyde coupling also caused intensification of this 2ϑ
peak, indicating the formation of another polymorph with an altered
crystalline structure.26 Interestingly,
the XRD studies’ peak intensification and shift did not show
a linear correlation with chain length, but rather created a parabolic
pattern with the most significant alternations in the N-octyl-substituted
polymer (Figure 1).

Due to the modified polymers’ amphiphilicity brought about
by incorporating hydrophobic substituents to CS, self-assembly capabilities
were demonstrated in water as stable aggregates. Critical aggregate
concentrations (CACs) were determined using both pyrene-based spectrofluorometric
method27 and dynamic light-scattering technique.
The CACs of N-alkyliminated CS derivatives were found to correlate
linearly with substituent side chain length, where the longer substituents
led to lower CAC values. For instance, N-functionalizing CS with a
C3-alkyl chain was seen to reduce its CAC by 2-fold, whereas coupling
it with a C12-alkyl chain reduced the relevant CAC by a factor of
300 (Table 1).

a CS-12 was not investigated
for WVTR
due to its brittleness, values followed by different letters are significantly
different according to Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD)
test at p ≤ 0.05.

This is because longer alkyl chain substituents had
stronger hydrophobic
repelling forces in bulk aqueous solvent, seeking to rearrange themselves
into a more stable structure at lower concentrations. Notably, the
α–β nonsaturated conjugate had a significant effect
on the CAC values. It can be seen that CS-6′ had demonstrated
a 20-fold reduction than its corresponding saturated counterpart,
which is an important observation that can be helpful for the design
of delivery systems that require extremely low CACs with constricting
substituent length limitations (Figure 2).

CS derivatives via dynamic light scattering (blue) and spectrofluorometric
scans (red). For graphical purposes, the parent CS values have been
placed to the left (over a #C value of 1).

Physical and mechanical properties of N-alkyliminated CS
derivatives-based
films were examined. The incorporation of hydrophobic substituents
was reflected in their water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs). Because
hydrophobic moieties repel water vapors from diffusing freely through
the polymer chains, a reduction in WVTR values for the modified polymers
as compared to the original CS was observed. Double-bonded side chains
have led to an increase in permeability, as an expected unsaturation
brought on less rotational freedom, expressed in bulkier interactions
between neighboring polymeric chains.

An increase in film thickness
with coupled alkyl chain length was
also seen, as they led to larger spacing between neighboring polymer
chains. In fact, this increase was significant enough so that statistical
analyses performed on these results yielded significant differences
between each consecutive aldehyde used. A noticeable increase was
observed when coupling CS with a 12-carbon long aldehyde, as the formed
distance between neighboring polymeric chains caused this formulation
to lose structural integrity, as displayed in its mechanical properties.
Also, double-bonded conjugates showed a characteristic increase in
their thickness in relation to their equivalent aliphatic counterparts
due to limited rotational freedom brought about by their nonsaturation.

Concerning mechanical properties such as roughness, rigidity, and
elasticity, N-modifying CS showed, for the most part, an increasingly
detrimental effect on polymer integrity with longer substituents due
to a more significant separation between their polymer chains (Table 1). Double-bonded conjugates
gained more stability with improved properties than their saturated
equivalents only in their TS values. The α–β double-bond
system for CS-6′ is closer to the N-imine linkage, forming
a conjugated π-electron system that stabilized this polymer’s
chain-to-chain interactions. As expected, CS-11′ did not gain
this stability effect via N-imine conjugation with its terminal double
bond and therefore had weaker mechanical properties.

So far,
a nearly linear correlation between side chain length and
subsequent polymer properties was observed. However, further investigations
have revealed a different pattern, with a repeating parabolic trend
that peaks with substituents of similar lengths, as though indicating
that a specific alkyl chain length is better suited for a coupling
reaction (Tables 1 and 2).

Evidence
of this notable parabolic behavior was first observed
by analyzing the reactions’ N-imination yields. Various aldehydes
have produced different coupling yields inconsistent with chain length,
demonstrating N-octyl’s superior reactivity over other substituent,
with yield of 92.33% (comparatively, other substituents have resulted
in yields of 2.58–54.16%). Interestingly, the location of double
bonds across the side chains had a more drastic effect on yield outcome.
CS-6′ yielded fewer products than its aliphatic counterpart,
and this is thought to stem from its α–β double-bond
system that experiences a keto–enol equilibrium, minimizing
potential substrates for successful N-imination. Accordingly, the
terminal double bond in CS-11′ did not interrupt the N-imination
reaction because it does not have a keto–enol system, with
a yield that correlates with its neighboring aliphatic aldehydes.

To further explore the parabolic trend phenomenon, a competitive
study was performed in which all of the aliphatic aldehydes were simultaneously
combined in equal ratios to couple with CS. It was found that even
under these circumstances, the aldehydes’ respective yields
still followed a parabolic trend in respect to their chain length,
with N-octyl producing the most favorable results (Figure 3, left).

parabolic pattern when combined in a coupling reaction. (Right) The
intensity change in pyrene’s fluorescent spectra at λ
370 nm upon encapsulation by different N-alkyliminated CS derivatives.
Figure amended to correspond with Figures 4 and 5.

The encapsulation capabilities of the N-alkyliminated
CS derivatives
was studied using pyrene as a fluorescent probe, which had previously
been used also to determine the critical aggregate concentrations
(CACs). Although the CAC values were obtained in a linear progression
with side chain length, the degree of change in pyrene’s fluorescent
intensity was parabolic, pointing to the differences in encapsulation
capacities, with the highest change caused by the N-octylimine CS
derivative (Figure 3, right).

The reported parabolic trend with an extremum point
located near
the N-octyl substituted derivatives was also observed in the N-alkyliminated
CS derivatives’ physical properties, such as relative viscosity
and water contact angle (Figure 4). The surface free energy
of the N-alkyliminated CS derivative-based films was evaluated by
measuring their water contact angles (WCAs). CS’s original
WCA was measured to be 102.38 ± 1.58°, correlating with
the previously reported values.26 Coupling
short (C3, C4) or long (C-12) aldehydes caused an increase in the
films’ WCA, which correlates to lower wettability and surface
energy. Moderate-length aldehydes (C6, C8, and C10) show a decreased
original WCA, pointing to films with higher surface free energies.
Although the parabolic effect had been initially witnessed through
the modified biopolymers’ obtained N-imination yields, it was
also found in several other unrelated physical properties. It is therefore
worth noting that this effect can stem from either the coupled side
chain length or result from different amounts of the obtained N-imination
yields.

angles (left) and relative viscosity (right). Figure amended to correspond
with Figures 3 and 5.

In addition to our experimental
studies, the aldehydes’
side chain effect was also explored using a kinetic model. As this
approach had not been used before for the study of the side chain
effect with such polymers in water as a solvent, it required us to
adapt and develop it accordingly. The model was hence based on our
experimental results as well as a previously reported work by Ogata
et al., who have studied the Schiff base reactions between different
aldehydes and ammonia as a source of a nitrogenous compound.28 By extrapolating Ogata’s data, equilibrium
constants could be procured for reactions between aldehydes used in
this study and ammonia. These were termed Kmonomeric, as they described a monomeric system. Yields for these hypothetical
monomeric reactions between our studied aldehydes and ammonia were
then calculated (eqs 1 and 2, see Experimental Procedures section for amine [N]0 and aldehyde [A]0 initial
concentration calculations). Schiff base reaction

  1   2  Yields of the monomeric reactions were then
compared to our corresponding experimental yields, which allowed defining
factor F that converts Kmonomeric to Kpolymeric (see Experimental Procedures section for details). Kpolymeric are equilibrium constants for reactions between
aldehydes and CS. It can be seen that for the monomeric system, the
equilibrium constants decrease with increasing aldehyde chain length.
Our polymeric systems have however demonstrated a different effect
with growing equilibrium constants as the aldehyde chain length increased
(Table 3). To explain
this phenomenon, it should be noted that in addition to electronic
and steric effects, the aldehydes’ solubility plays an important
role.

As
longer aldehydes with lower water solubility interacted with
CS, they became part of a soluble macromolecule that has a hydrophilic
nature that can shield and protect them from the bulk aqueous solvent,
helping to compensate for their hydrophobicity. There is, therefore,
a strong driving force for a coupling reaction to take place between
these aldehydes and CS, with unfavorable reverse reactions. On the
other hand, the hydrophobic aldehydes’ poor water solubility
could also prevent their coupling reactions with CS from ever taking
place. In such instances, solubility equilibrium constants (Ksp) should be taken into account when calculating
these reactions’ overall equilibrium constants (Ktotal). Specifically, for reactions involving C3–C8,
the aldehydes were found to be completely soluble during the reaction
time (see Experimental Procedures for details),
and their Ksp were therefore not included
in their Ktotal calculation. Hence, in
those cases, Ktotal equaled to Kpolymeric. For reactions involving the longer
C10–C12, the aldehydes were found to not be completely soluble
during the reaction time; hence, for them, Ksp was included in their Ktotal calculation (eq 3) 3  At this point, theoretical yields for the
actual polymeric system were calculated between CS and each of the
studied aldehydes (eqs 1 and 2).

The parabolic pattern as previously
described has emerged again
(Figure 5), this time
as calculated reaction yields using a kinetic model. The reason for
this is the happenstance of two opposing effects in the studied system;
on the one hand, the CS structure enabled the entrapment of hydrophobic
aldehydes that preferred to be surrounded by it rather than the bulk
aqueous solvent.

Figure 5 Experimental (red) and theoretical (blue) yields for N-alkyliminated
CS derivatives. Figure amended to correspond with Figures 3 and 4.

In the case of very hydrophobic
aldehydes, the same aqueous solution
prevented them from dissolving and reacting with CS. In this regard,
octanal seems to be an aldehyde of an ideal chain length in which
it dissolved well enough to have completed a coupling reaction, yet
was not readily cleaved from the polymer once it had reacted due to
its relative hydrophobicity.

Conclusions
This study sought to
apply side chain engineering for the modification
of a nature-sourced polymer and study its effect on the resulted polymer
properties. Interestingly, numerous analyses in this study have not
followed a linear progression relating to substituent chain length,
but an unanticipated parabolic pattern that was corroborated using
a calculated kinetic model. This model has assisted in shedding light
on the inspected phenomenon, explaining that not only steric and electronic
factors but also solubility-related interfacial factors govern the
coupling reaction and the resulting properties of the modified biopolymers.
The presented findings may serve as a platform for further synthetic
strategies that will allow the formation of rationally designed nature-sourced
materials with controlled properties, promoting their use in various
biorelated fields.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
CS was
purchased from Molekula (Munich, Germany).
Propanal, butanal, trans-2-hexenal, octanal, decanal,
and undecylenic aldehyde were purchased from Acros Organics (Geel,
Belgium). Hexanal, dodecanal, acetic acid, and pyrene were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Double deionized water (DDW)
was obtained by mechanically filtering them through a Treion TS1173
column. Hexane and toluene were purchased from Bio-lab (Ashkelon,
Israel). Deuterated solvents for NMR analysis (D2O, AcOH-d4) were purchased from Armar Chemicals (Döttingen,
Switzerland). Gas chromatography gases (helium, compressed air, nitrogen,
and hydrogen) were purchased from Gordon Gas and Chemicals (Tel Aviv,
Israel) at a 99.999% grade. All the reagents, solvents, and gases
were used without further purification.

Methods
Preparation
of CS Modifications
CS, 1.5% w/v, was stirred
and dissolved in 100 mL DDW at 23 ± 1 °C. Acetic acid, 0.6%
v/v, was added beforehand to facilitate CS solubility. Once the solution
had achieved sufficient homogeneity (60 min), a selected aldehyde
was added at 25.1 mmol and the solution stirred for an additional
60 min to create the N-imine bond. According to CS’s degree
of deacetylation (% DD, 94% determined according to 1H
NMR and the first derivative UV method as detailed further on), its
free amines were calculated as (1.5/161) × 0.94, where 1.5 g
is CS’s mass, 161 g/mol is its glucosamine monomer’s
molecular weight, and 0.94 is the monomer’s molar fraction.
Aldehydes were thus added at 2.85 equiv with respect to CS’s
amines. Solutions were then kept at 4 ± 1 °C for liquid
analyses. Solid films were obtained by casting 5 mL portions of the
solutions into Teflon Petri dishes (5 cm in diameter) and dried at
23 ± 1 °C overnight at relative humidity (RH) of 65 ±
2%. The prepared films were washed with hexane to remove excess unattached
aldehydes, dried for 2 h in a vacuum desiccator, and stored at −18
°C.

Degree of Deacetylation
NMR was utilized to determine
% DD. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AMX-500
NMR spectrometer with 500 MHz. The spectra were calibrated to the
solvent residual peak (4.79 ppm). The samples were prepared using
D2O as a solvent, with 0.6% v/v AcOH-d4, at 298 K. Temperature calibration of the spectrometer
was performed using CHOH/CDOD. The degree of deacetylation (% DD)
was found by calculating N-acetyl’s integral value. In addition,
% DD was also determined by the first derivative UV method. Briefly,
glucosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine were separately
dissolved in concentrated phosphoric acid in different concentrations.
Their UV first derivative was then measured at 203 nm, indicating
their respective weight fraction in a random commercial CS polymer.
Next, the CS samples were weighed in triplicate and heated to 60 °C
for 40 min in 20 mL of 85% phosphoric acid. The samples were then
diluted and heated for an additional 2 h in 60 °C. The first-derivative
UV method was then applied again and compared to the original monomers’
results, based on the formula  where m1 is the
mass of N-acetyl-glucosamine in a single CS sample, m2 is the mass of glucosamine in a single chitosan
sample, and DA is the degree of acetylation.

% DD is 100 –
% DA.

Gel Permeation Chromatography
Molecular weight and
polydispersity index for chitosan were determined as 59 826
g/mol and 3.66 Mw/Mn, respectively. This was done using gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) consisting of a Waters Alliance system e2695 separation module
(Waters Israel) equipped with a refractive index detector, model blue
2414. The mobile phase used was a 0.02 M acetic acid/0.1 M sodium
acetate buffer with an addition of 10 mL of acetic acid to the 2.5
L buffer batch (pH 4.2) under isocratic elution for 30 min at a flow
rate of 0.7 mL/min. The injection volume was 20 μL and the temperature
of both detector and columns was 30 °C. Analyses were carried
out using an ultrahydrogel column, 2000, 12 μm, 7.8 mm ×
300 mm, 500–10 M (Waters). Molecular weights were determined
relative to a dextran standards kit (PSS Polymer standards service
GmbH, Germany) with a molecular weight range of 4400–401 000
Da. All the data provided by the GPC system were collected and analyzed
with the Empower 3 personal dissolution software.

ATR-FTIR
ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was performed using
a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5 FTIR spectrometer. Modified CS films
were subjected to 32 scans at a 4 cm–1 resolution
between 500 and 4000 cm–1.

Mechanical Properties
Young’s modulus (YM),
elongation at break (EB), and tensile stress (TS) of the inspected
films were determined using an Instron 3345 instrument with an Instron
force transducer load cell (Norwood, MA). Tests were performed at
a speed of 1 mm/s. The TS was expressed in (MPa) and calculated by
dividing the maximum load (N) by the cross-sectional area (m2). The EB was calculated by dividing the extension at the moment
of rupture by the initial gauge length of the samples and multiplying
by 100. The YM was expressed in (MPa) and determined by the ratio
of the stress along an axis over the strain along that axis in the
range of stress. All the measurements were performed in triplicate
for each film type.

X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD)
X-ray
patterns for CS and
its aliphatic N-iminated modifications were analyzed as film samples
using a Brucker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer. The samples were
scanned between 2ϑ = 5–40° with a scanning speed
of 2° min–1.

Gas Chromatography
The samples were analyzed using
a Shimadzu GC 2010 apparatus equipped with an autosampler (MPS, Gerstel).
Experimental polymeric yields were calculated by dissolving the product
films (5 mg) in water (4 mL DDW) and adding acetic acid (40 μL)
to cleave off the attached aldehydes from the polymers. According
to a classic organic N-imine cleavage mechanism, the acidic conditions
catalyze the reaction and ensure sufficient cleavage, releasing the
aldehydes into the solution. The aldehydes were then extracted by
an organic solvent and analyzed via GC chromatograms for quantification.
Aldehyde extraction was performed by hexane (5 mL × 3) when hexanal,
hexenal, octanal, undecenal, or dodecanal were analyzed. Because the
retention time for the hexane solvent is similar to those of propanal
and butanal, toluene was used as an organic solvent for the extraction
and analysis of these aldehydes. Three repetitions of a 1 μL
organic phase sample volume were then injected into a GC (starting
oven’s temperature 60 °C) and held for 1 min, followed
by a temperature increase to 100 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min,
an additional increase to 200 °C at the rate of 20 °C/min,
and a final temperature increase to 280 °C rate of 10 °C/min
and held for 3 min, with helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of
1.3 mL/min; split was 1:50. The injection port was set at 250 °C.
Analytes were separated on an Agilent VF5-ms column (30 m length,
0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) and detection was made
on an flame ionization detector at a set temperature of 290 °C.
Shimadzu LabSolutions software was used for post-run analysis and
retention times were found to be 1.80, 2.03, 3.45, 6.01, 8.15, and
9.76 min for propanal, butanal, hexanal, octanal, decanal, and dodecanal,
respectively. Obtained areas for the individual aldehydes (which had
been individually calibrated) were used as an indication of the amount
of aldehyde per 1 μL in the injector and retro-extrapolated
to calculate the amount of aldehydes in the product films.

Water
Vapor Tansmission Rate (WVTR)
WVTR was measured
gravimetrically using the ASTM E-96 method31 adapte to hydrophilic films.32 Briefly,
vessels filled with 10 mL of DDW were sealed with films using carbon
tape and rubber bands were weighed and placed in desiccators containing
dry silica gel (50% RH, 23 °C). The vessels were allowed to stand
for 2 h to reach an initial equilibrium and then weighed with 8 h
intervals during 48 h. Water vapors escaped by permeation through
the film, and the water loss was recorded by analytical balance (±0.0001
g). WVTRs (g/h m2) were obtained by plotting the weight
loss vs time in a linear regression (r ≥ 0.99)
and dividing the slope by the exposed film area (m2). The
film samples were measured in triplicates.

Water Contact Angle
The static contact angles for the
film samples were measured at ambient conditions using a Kruss Drop
Shape Analyzer instrument, model DSA100S. The angles were measured
within 1 s of contact, after placing 2 μL individual drops of
DDW on the film surface. For each sample, the contact angles of three
different positions on the surface were measured in triplicate and
calculated by the sessile drop method, using the Advance software
for analysis.

Spectrofluorometry
Modified CS was
studied using pyrene
as a fluorescent probe. Its fluorescent emission spectrum comprises
of vibronic peaks that show a strong dependency on the solvent’s
polarity.27,33 The ratio between two specific peaks (i.e., I3 ∼ 383 nm and I1 ∼ 373 nm) in pyrene’s spectrum were used as
a quantitative measurement for its microenvironment’s polarity.
Any change in the surrounding polarity, such as when pyrene is encapsulated
from an aqueous environment by a hydrophobic-cored aggregate, is expressed
by this ratio’s value.34 Pyrene’s
highly hydrophobic nature and low water solubility (2–3 μM)
ensure its preference to be present in hydrophobic environment over
hydrophilic ones. These characteristics make pyrene an ideal fluorescent
probe for analyzing a substance’s critical aggregate concentration.
Pyrene was first dissolved in absolute ethanol to obtain a 1 mM stock
solution and then further diluted with various water-based modified
biopolymer solutions at varying concentrations, always yielding a
final concentration of 1 μM. Fluorescence spectra of modified
biopolymer samples were measured in a standard 1 cm quartz cell using
a computer-controlled Shimadzu, RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer equipped
with a 150 W xenon lamp (Ushio Inc., Japan). The excitation wavelength
for pyrene was 330 nm with a slit width of 3 nm, and the emission
band recorded was 360–380 nm with a slit width of 3 nm, at
increments of 0.5 nm. All the samples measured were kept at 23 ±
1 °C. All the samples were made in duplicate, and each duplicate
was scanned twice. The spectra were not corrected for instrumental
bias and may differ slightly in position and intensity from the spectra
collected on other instruments. However, any deviations from the true
spectra due to our instrumental configuration are consistent across
all the samples within this data set. Critical aggregate concentrations
values were calculated as the intersection between two linear lines
depicting the aggregate formation dependent on the concentration in
the solution.29

Dynamic Light Scattering
Critical aggregate concentrations
were also gauged using a Nano ZS ZEN3500 Malvern light-scattering
photometer equipped with a laser at an operating wavelength of 532
nm. Measurements were performed at 25 °C with a detection angle
of 173° in optically homogeneous quartz cylinder cuvettes. The
samples were prepared from the original reaction solutions at varying
dilutions and vortexed before the measurements. Each sample was measured
three times, and the average serial data were calculated. Critical
aggregate concentrations were obtained by using a previously published
method.29 Briefly, a concentration gradient
was prepared, and each sample was measured for its kcps (kilo counts
per second) value. By plotting the samples’ kcps against their
concentration, two linear lines were formed, and their intersection
depicts the materials’ critical aggregate concentrations.

Relative Viscosity
Relative viscosity was measured
for the CS modifications using an Ubbelohde viscometer in a 0.2 M
acetic acid/0.1 M sodium acetate aqueous solution at 23 ± 1 °C.35 Acetic acid was used to facilitate polymer solubility
and sodium acetate was added to screen the polymer’s ionic
groups’ electrostatic repulsion force on the polymer chain.

Theoretical Calculations
Equilibrium constants for
reactions between all of the aldehydes used in this study and ammonia
were calculated based on Ogata et al.28 and termed as Kmonomeric (Table 1). As most of the aldehydes
used in this study were longer than reported by Ogata et al., their
data were appropriately extrapolated (Figure S2). Monomeric yields (Table S2) that correspond
to Kmonomeric were then found by solving eq 1, where x is the change in reactant concentration. This equation is repeated
here for the readers’ convenience Schiff base reaction
  Change in
reactant conc.
  4  Equation 2 was used to calculate monomeric yields. This
equation is
repeated here for the readers’ convenience 5  Aldehyde concentrations [A]0 (Table S2) were calculated by dividing the number
of moles added (25.1 mmol) by the final reaction volume (100 mL +
aldehyde volume added). Reaction volumes were calculated using eq 4. 6  Amine concentrations [N]0 (Table S2) were calculated by dividing the number
of amine group moles by the reaction volume. The number of amine groups
moles was calculated using eq 5, where 1.5 g is the amount of CS added to 100 mL of water,
161 g/mol is the molecular weight of CS’s deacetylated monomer,
and 0.94 is this monomer’s molar fraction. 7  Due to a discrepancy between Ogata’s
monomeric system (ammonia) and our experimental polymeric system (CS,
which contains multiple amine groups), a mathematical factor F (Table S2) was devised to mediate
between the two mathematically. It was defined as Kmonomeric/Kpolymeric, where Kmonomeric was calculated as previously described
and Kpolymeric was obtained using our
experimental data. For its calculation, we used the experimental yields
as obtained through the GC experiments (detailed in the above GC paragraph)
and applied them to eqs 1 and 2. Through eq 2, we were able to obtain the value for x because in that equation, all of the other parameters
are known. The obtained x values were then inserted
into eq 1, which led
us to calculate Kpolymeric. A graph representing Ksp as a function of aldehyde chain length was
generated (Figure S3), with an exponential
decrease in solubility. Ksp values for
C3–C8 were found in the literature and extrapolated to yield
values for C10 and C12 (Figure S4), as
detailed in Table 3.

To assess the differences in the solubility’s influence
on reaction equilibria, the time needed for a reaction to reach its
equilibrium point was estimated (t99).
Forward reaction rates were calculated as , deliberately
neglecting reverse reactions
based on the assumption that aldehydes are trapped within the polymeric
structure. A pseudo-first-order reaction was also assumed because
the concentration of the dissolved aldehyde remains constant during
the reaction time. Due to the poor solubility of the aldehydes, most
of them do not take an active part in the aqueous solvent. Due to
the poor solubility of the aldehydes, most of them do not take an
active part in the aqueous solvent. Only a small fraction of them
is dissolved and takes an active role in a successful reaction, which
is then converted into products. This soluble fraction’s concentration
is kept constant until the reaction comes to an end when no more aldehyde
is left at t99. These assumptions are
especially accurate for longer aldehydes. The mathematical format
for this assumption is based on eq 6 8  where kforward is 0.025 s–1 M–1,28 [A]sol is
the aldehyde’s soluble
concentration, which is effectively Ksp, and [N] is the amine concentration that decreases over time due
to reaction with the aldehydes. Because the reaction was treated as
a pseudo-first-order, its rate constant was defined as in eq 7 9  As such, the time needed for the
reaction
to reach 99% completion (t99) was calculated
for each of the aldehydes using eq 8 10  Results for t99 are summarized in Table S2. A surge in t99 values was found
to occur between C8 and
C10, which is compatible with the pattern change seen for factor F, suggesting once again that the solubility parameter is
paramount in our experimental setting starting from a 10-carbon long
chain. To understand our experimental results when both the polymeric
system and the solubility are brought into consideration, theoretical
polymeric yields were calculated. This was done using an equilibrium
constant for every aldehyde. This equilibrium constant consisted of
our extrapolated Kmonomeric (obtained
through eq 1) divided
by factor F. For C10 and C12, where solubility became
an issue, Kpolymeric was further multiplied
by Ksp, assuming two consecutive equilibrium
processes (solubility followed by amine and aldehyde reaction). The
obtained theoretical yields were calculated using eq 1, and the results are displayed
in Table 3.

Statistical
Analyses
Statistical analysis was carried
out using Microsoft Office Excel spreadsheets to calculate means,
standard deviations, and 95% t confidence intervals.
The JMP statistical software program, version 7, was used for further
statistical calculations (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), including
a one-way variance analysis (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey honestly
significant difference (HSD) post hoc test. Results marked with different
letters are significantly different at p ≤
0.05.
