Quartz and silica are common materials,
and their dissolution is
of significant interest to a wide range of scientists. The kinetics
of the dissolution of quartz and silica have been measured extensively,
yet no clear theory of dissolution is available. A novel theory of
dissolution and crystallization has recently been proposed that envisages
the removal of material from the surface to form ions in solution
leaving behind a charged surface vacancy. These vacancies create a
potential difference across the Stern layer that accelerates or retards
the removal of ions. In this way, the surface potential difference
is caused by and influences the rate of the removal of ions. From
this theory, a model of quartz dissolution is derived that predicts
the observed orders of reaction. This prediction of the orders of
reaction fits a data set consisting of 285 experiments. The model
also describes the effect of Na+, K+, and Li+ ions, as well as the effect of heavy water. A significant
component of the model is its ability to describe the zeta potential
of the quartz–water interface. The model successfully predicts
a transient period at the beginning of the reaction when the rate
could either increase or decrease.

Introduction
Quartz (SiO2) is a common material
and a ubiquitous
mineral, the second most abundant mineral in the earth’s crust
after feldspar. It is present in many types of rocks.1 Consequently, quartz has a major influence on geochemical
processes, including the formation of mineralized deposits of economic
value. Importantly, the dissolution and crystallization of quartz
may play a part in controlling the concentration of silica in water
and hydrothermal systems, providing controls on natural waters.2

Biologically, silica (SiO2.nH2O) strengthens the cell walls of animals and
plants.3 Silica provides stiffness to bamboo
and rigidity to the
thorns of stinging nettles.4 The radula
of many molluscs consists of an inner structure of goethite, protected
and strengthened by a layer of silica.5

Industrially, quartz is frequently regarded as inert (with
respect
to water). However, quartz and other silicate minerals can be a source
of dissolved and colloidal silica, which result in poor filtration
and settling properties in industrial applications. Hence, the topic
of the dissolution of quartz is of interest to material scientists,
chemical engineers, biologists, environmental scientists, and geochemists,
and many others.2

It has been said
that to overestimate the importance of the dissolution
of quartz and silica is hard.6 However,
chemists have not yet provided a clear explanation for the kinetics
of the dissolution of quartz.6 The purpose
of this article is to approach this problem in an entirely novel manner,
leading to a kinetic model of the dissolution of quartz and silica.
In particular, the effects of pH, sodium ions, and heavy water at
steady state are described. In addition to the description of these
steady-state phenomena, the new approach is able to describe transient
effects, where initially the rate is observed to either increase or
decrease depending on the conditions adopted.

The dissolution
of quartz in water occurs by reaction 1, which forms silicic acid.6 1  The kinetics of the dissolution of
quartz
has received significant attention and continues to be the subject
of many studies. The aim of many of these studies (and this study)
is to interpret the kinetic data, usually the measured rate of reaction
as a function of concentration and temperature, in terms of a mechanism,
which seeks to inform us of the critical events during dissolution.

The general characteristics of the dissolution of quartz and silica
glass as a function of pH are shown in Figures 1 and 2. At low pH
values, the rate is low and independent of the pH. As the pH increases
into the alkaline region, the rate increases. The slope of the plot
of log(rate) against pH is close to 0.5, that is, the order of reaction
with respect to OH– ions is close to 0.5. Orders
of reaction that are fractional have proved difficult to describe.

Figure 1 Rate of
dissolution of quartz at 25 and 60 °C as a function
of pH. The data, represented by the points, are from Brady and Walther,7 House and Orr,8 and
Bennett.9 The gray lines represent the
fit of the proposed model, eq 18, to the data.

Figure 2 Rate of dissolution of quartz, silica glass, and basalt glass as
a function of pH. The rates for silica and basalt glass are measured
at 65 °C, and those for quartz are measured at 60 °C. The
data, represented by the points, are sourced from Brady and Walther7 and Brady and House.10 The gray lines represent the fit of the proposed model, eq 18, to the data.

The results shown in Figures 1 and 2 imply that, whereas the
absolute value of the rate depends on the long-range order or crystallinity
of the material, the mechanism of dissolution does not. The reason
for this conclusion is that the orders of reactions with respect to
H+ and OH– are the same in the same regions
of pH, and this implies that the mechanism does not change depending
on the crystallinity. This conclusion is critical, because it negates
proposals that anisotropy of crystal faces and particular bond structures
are important.

Rimstidt6 examined
the data compiled
from the literature by Dove11 and Bickmore12 for 285 dissolution experiments in acid and
alkaline solutions between pH values of 1 and 12 and at temperatures
ranging from 25 to 300 °C. He correlated these data using the
empirical regression given by eq 2(6) 2  This
empirical regression of the data highlights
three features of the kinetics of the dissolution of quartz: (i) the
reaction in the acidic region is dependent only on the temperature
(first term of the right-hand side of eq 2); (ii) the reaction in the alkaline region is dependent
on the concentrations of sodium and hydroxide ions and on the temperature
(second term of the right-hand side of eq 2), and, finally, (iii) the reaction exhibits
orders of reaction that are fractional.

Rimstidt6 found no evidence in the data
reported in the literature for the rate of dissolution to increase
at pH values lower than the isoelectric point, approximately at a
pH of 2.

It is tempting to interpret the functional dependence
on Na+ and OH– in eq 2 as a dependency of the rate on the concentration
of
NaOH. However, this is not the case. Dove11 measured the rate of dissolution at a pH of about 5.7 and at a temperature
of 200 °C as a function of NaCl. These results are given in Figure 3, which indicates
that the rate of dissolution is enhanced by the concentration of Na+ ions independently of the OH– ions. Interestingly,
the order of reaction for the data shown in Figure 3 is close to 0.5. It should also be noted
that Dove14 showed that there was nothing
particularly special about Na+ in the reaction. Li+ and K+ substitute equally, and indeed examination
of the data set used to obtain eq 2 reveals that several experiments listed as using Na+ in fact used K+.

Figure 3 Effect of the concentration of Na+ ions on the rate
of dissolution of quartz at 25 °C at pH 7 and 200 °C at
pH 5.7. The data at 25 °C are from Bennett9 and Bennet et al.,13 and the
data at 200 °C are from Dove.14

Of the kinetic characteristics
highlighted above, it is point (iii), in which the orders of reaction
are fractional, that is of particular interest. Such fractional orders
are particularly troublesome because elementary steps have orders
of reaction that are whole numbers, and combining such elementary
steps into a mechanism rarely leads to an overall order of reaction
that is fractional. As a result, many different kinetic mechanisms
have been proposed for the dissolution of quartz, all of which have
some advantages but all are ultimately unsatisfactory.

Three
main models have been used in the past to interpret the kinetic
data for the dissolution of quartz and other minerals: (i) the adsorption
model (Warren and Devuyst15), (ii) the
surface complexation model (Furrer and Stumm;16 Wieland et al.17), and (iii) the precursor
version of the surface complexation model (Oelkers et al.18). Of each of these classes of models, the surface
complexation model has been the one most commonly used to interpret
the data for the kinetics for quartz.

However, each of these
models has significant deficiencies.19−24 The adsorption model does not predict the correct orders of reaction
unless isotherms with arbitrarily adjustable parameters are used.
In addition, isotherms such as the Freundlich isotherm have been advanced
without the comprehension that this isotherm is simply an empirical
fit and contains no mechanistic insight. The surface complexation
model posits that the rate of dissolution is proportional to the concentration
of a species on the surface, the existence of which is not demonstrated.
This approach gives rise to a plethora of surface species. For example,
Bickmore et al.12 provide five different
surface complexation models for the dissolution of quartz that fit
the data equally well. To get the correct dependence of the rate on
pH, the concentration of one of these surface species is raised to
an arbitrary power. Without a valid explanation of the meaning or
source of this power (or order), the model is worthless. Recognizing
this as a major shortfall, the precursor model attempts to rescue
the surface complexation model by assuming that before the formation
of the surface complex, a precursor species forms. Unfortunately,
in the derivation of this model, a fundamental mistake is made by
assuming that fractional orders of reaction arise from fractional
stoichiometry.18 This is a fundamental
error in chemical kinetics. Each elementary reaction step that contributes
to an overall mechanism must have stoichiometry and orders of reaction
that are whole numbers, as the stoichiometry of an elementary reaction
is determined by its molecularity. In other words, half a proton cannot
react in an elementary reaction.

Rimstidt6 proposed that the way forward
might be to combine these models and several others into a “meta-explanation”
or a “unified” theory. However, this approach skirts
the main difficulty: that the origin of the fractional reaction orders
is unknown. As none of these models can address this simple question,
combining them will not provide any deeper insight.

Another
approach to the problem has used molecular modeling to
characterize the surface, to identify the bonds that are broken first,
and thereby describe the kinetic mechanism.25 As argued in this article, this program of work has not been successful
because of the failure to include the surface potential into the model.

The approach proposed in this article is novel. Following the author’s
previous work,19−24,26−28 we derive a
rate expression from elementary reaction steps for the separate removal
of anionic and cationic constituents in parallel that overcomes these
criticisms. This approach has been applied to the dissolution of silicates20 and oxides, hydroxides, and sulfides.22 The dissolution of forsterite26 and feldspar27,28 has been analyzed in
detail in terms of this approach.

The purpose of this article
is four-fold: (i) to propose a novel
mechanism for the dissolution of quartz, (ii) to demonstrate that
this model fits the same data analyzed by Rimstidt,6 (iii) to discuss how the proposed mechanism explains other
features of the quartz–mineral interface such as the zeta potential,
and (iv) to examine transient effects implied by the mechanism.

Proposed
Theory for the Dissolution Kinetics of Quartz
Surface Potential Difference
as a Variable in Dissolution
Consider a solid MA, where M
and A are the constituents that form
cations and anions upon dissolution, respectively. The theory proposed
by Crundwell19−24,26−28 argues that
dissolution of such a solid can be understood in terms of the following
steps: (i) dissolution occurs by the independent removal of M and
A from the surface (referred to as “partial” reactions);
(ii) removal of these components leaves charged vacancy sites on the
surface that manifest themselves as a potential difference across
the Stern layer, as shown in Figure 4; (iii) H+ ions or water generally complex
with the A component, and OH– ions or water generally
complex with the M component in each of the partial reactions; (iv)
the removal of both M and A are exponentially dependent on the potential
difference across the Helmholtz (Stern) layer with the opposite sign
in accordance with a Boltzmann distribution; (v) a steady state is
established with respect to the surface potential, which yields the
stoichiometric condition that the rate of removal of M is proportional
to the rate of removal of A.

Figure 4 Dissolution of anions and cations from the surface
of solid MA,
showing the development of surface charge due to vacancies. The M-constituent
of the solid interacts with OH– ions or water to
form cations in solution, and the A-constituent interacts with H+ ions or water to form anions in solution. ohp represents
the outer Helmholtz plane, which is the distance of closest approach
to the surface of a hydrated ion.

Stated in another way, the removal of the M and A constituents
from the surface is chemically independent but electrically coupled
due to the mutual and opposite dependence on the potential difference
across the Helmholtz layer. Such chemical independence but electrical
coupling is reminiscent of the mixed potential model of corrosion,
except with respect to the mechanism of charge formation. Both have
independent chemical reactions that are electrically coupled: “partial
reactions” in the proposed model, and “half-reactions”
in the case of corrosion. However, the surface of a metal is charged
by the excess or deficiency of electrons, whereas the surface in dissolution
is charged by an excess of cationic or anionic vacancies.

The
removal of the M and A constituents in parallel from the surface
and the concomitant creation of charged vacancies are illustrated
in Figure 4. Crundwell
has shown that this theory successfully describes the dissolution
of oxides, sulfides, and silicates,19−24 and particular work has thus far focused on the feldspar series
(KAlSi3O8–KAlSi3O8–CaAl2Si2O8)27,28 and olivine, Mg2SiO4.29

The key to the theory is that the removal of species or units
from
the surface creates a vacancy position on the surface that is charged.
For example, cationic vacancies are created if oxygen is removed from
the surface (by reaction with water or H+ ions), and anionic
vacancies are formed if silicon is removed as SiO2+ (by
reaction with OH– ions or water).

The excess
surface charge, σ, arising at any time due to
these vacancies is proportional to the difference in the concentration
of anionic and cationic vacancies on the surface, which is expressed
in eq 3(39,40) 3  The symbols nc and na represent the surface
concentration
of cationic and anionic vacancies, respectively, νc and νa represents the charge number on the cationic
and anionic vacancies, respectively, and F is the
Faraday constant. (Please refer to the list of symbols.)

The
imbalance between cationic and anionic vacancies on the surface
is small in chemical terms but large particularly in terms of the
field strength. For example, for a potential difference across the
interface of about 0.1 V, and an interfacial capacitance of about
0.05 F/m2 (typically found to be in the range of 0.01–0.2
F/m2),39,49 the difference in surface concentrations
of cationic and anionic vacancies is equal to 0.1 V × 0.05 F/m2/96 500 C/mol = 5 × 10–8 mol/m2, assuming a single charge on each of the vacancies. This
potential occurs across the narrow Stern layer, which is on the order
of 3 × 10–10 m in width.41 Thus, the field strength is 0.1 V/3 × 10–10 = 3 × 109 V/m, which is extremely high. This high
field strength will dominate the rate of removal of any charged species
from the surface.

The excess surface charge gives rise to a
potential difference,
Δϕ, across the region that lies between the surface and
the plane of closest approach of hydrated ions, given by eq 4. This region is referred to as
the Stern or Helmholtz layer, whereas the plane of closest approach
of hydrated ions is referred to as the outer Helmholtz plane (ohp).41 4  The symbol Cd represents
the capacitance of the Stern layer. The charge on the surface, and
hence the potential difference across the Stern layer, is dynamic,
in the sense that it is created by the dissolution reactions. To relate
this potential difference to the kinetics, the rates of change are
required. The rate of change of the potential difference with time
is obtained from eq 4 by taking derivatives of both sides, as shown in eq 5(40) 5  The rate
of change of the surface concentration
of cationic vacancies is equal to the rate of removal of anionic species,
that is, dnc/dt is equal
to r–. Similarly, dna/dt is equal to r+. As the charge number of the departing ion is the same as
the vacancy left behind, νa is the same as the cationic
charge, ν+, and νc is the same as
ν–. The substitution of these relationships
into eq 5 yields eq 6. 6  An indication
of the potential difference
across the Stern layer can be obtained from measurements of the zeta
potential, which is the potential difference between the bulk solution
and the ohp. Figure 5 shows the change in zeta potential with time, indicating the surface
charge changes with time. In the past, these changes in zeta potential
have been interpreted as being caused by exogenous factors, such as
the dissolution of the containers. However, the argument presented
here is that such dynamic changes are due to the endogenous factor
of the creation of charged vacancies on the quartz surface. With sufficient
time, a stationary state will prevail, and the dissolution will occur
steadily so that the left-hand side of eq 6 is approximately zero. This stationary state
is described by eq 7. 7  The stationary
state given by eq 7 is
actually the condition of stoichiometry.
For the dissolution reaction written as Mv–Av+ → ν–Mv+ + ν+Av–, stoichiometry demands that the rates
are related by eq 8,
which is the same as eq 7. 8  For such a stationary state to evolve and
stoichiometric dissolution to occur, and particularly for this stationary
state to be stable, the rates of removal of both cations and anions
must be dependent on the potential difference across the Stern layer,
Δϕ. A negative surface will attract cations and repel
anions. A positive surface will attract anions and repel cations.
This seems somewhat obvious, but none of the previously proposed models
of the dissolution of quartz account for this effect.

after pretreatment with HF and NaOH showing
the slow “ageing” of the sample. Data from Hunter (ref (42) page 283).

Positive changes in the surface potential difference
will enhance
the rate of removal of cations and will retard the rate of removal
of anions. In this sense, Δϕ is a hidden variable in dissolution,
hidden in that it is not immediately apparent from the macroscopic
variables or kinetics. It is by exposing and accounting for this hidden
variable that this article makes its primary contribution.

Functional
Form of Rate of Removal of Cations and Anions
To use eq 7 to further
the derivation, the functional form for the rates of removal of cations, r+, and anions, r–, is required. There are two aspects to proposing such a functional
form. The first is the chemical aspect regarding the effect of the
reactants of each partial reaction on its rate, and the second is
the electrical aspect regarding the effect of the surface potential
difference. For the proposed mechanism to consist of elementary steps,
rates r+ and r– must be proportional to the reactants raised to a power or reaction
order that is a whole number. The proposed functional form for the
electrical aspect is a Boltzmann-like dependence on the potential
difference between the surface and outer Helmholtz plane, ohp. For
departing cations, a positive change in this potential difference
enhances r+. Likewise, for departing anions,
a positive change in the potential difference retards r–.

The rate of removal of cations from the
surface, given by eq 9, will be enhanced by increasing concentrations of hydroxide ions
and surface potential difference, as expressed by eq 10(19−24) 9   10  Equation 9 represents
the first step in the mechanism that ultimately
leads to the formation of H4SiO4 as the stable
species in solution. The species SiO(OH)+ is an intermediate
that rapidly reacts with water and hydroxide to form H4SiO4 by the reaction SiO(OH)+ + OH– + H2O → H4SiO4.

The
symbols in eqs 9 and 10 are defined as follows: ≡SiO
represents a silicon site at the surface, ≡2– represents a vacancy site at the surface, k⃗+ represents the rate constant, and y represents the potential-dependent term 0.5FΔϕ/RT. The factor 0.5 arises because the activated state (transition
state) occurs approximately halfway between the surface and the ohp,
an assumption that is commonly made in electrochemistry.41 The term exp(y) is a Boltzmann-like
factor that accounts for the requirement that a more positive surface
potential will increase the rate of removal of cationic species. [...]
represents the concentration of the relevant ion at the ohp, which
is the same as in the bulk solution if the solution is not dilute.
In this section of the article, the concentration at the ohp is regarded
as being close to the concentration in the bulk.

The rate of
removal of anions is envisaged as occurring in two
parallel reactions. H+ and Na+ ions both accelerate
the removal of anions, not jointly, but in parallel. These parallel
partial reactions are given in eqs 11 and 12. The action of Na+ (and other cations, such as Li+ and K+) is proposed to be catalytic.6 Positive
changes in the surface potential difference retard the removal of
anions. Thus, the rate of removal of the anionic units is given by eq 13. 11   12   13  The symbols k⃗–,1 and k⃗–,2 represent the rate constants with respect to the rates that are
accelerated by H+ and Na+ ions, respectively.
The symbols ≡O and ≡2+ represent an oxygen
site and an oxygen vacancy at the surface, respectively.

Equations 7, 10, and 13 represent three equations
in three unknown variables, r+, r–, and y. The substitution
of eqs 10 and 13 into eq 7 gives eq 14, an expression in which y is the only unknown variable. 14  The substitution
of this expression back into
either of eq 10 or 13 yields eq 15 after some algebraic manipulation. 15  This expression might be further simplified
by recognizing that [H+][OH–] is the
equilibrium constant for dissociation of water, Kw, at a fixed temperature. The rate dissolution of quartz
is equivalent to r+. The rate expression
for the dissolution of quartz at a single temperature is given by eq 16. 16  Rate constant k1 is given by k⃗+k⃗–,1ν–Kw/ν+,
whereas rate constant k2 is given by k⃗+k⃗–,2ν–/ν+.

It is important
to take note of the square root function in eq 16. The square root has
arisen naturally from the requirement that the kinetic expressions
of the removal of cationic and anionic units from the surface are
dependent on the potential difference across the interface. Such half-order
reactions also arise in the oxidative dissolution of minerals.49 This is the only known derivation of the kinetics
of dissolution that correctly gives fractional orders of reaction.

Equation 16 has similar
features to the empirical expression given in eq 2. At low pH values, the first term on the
right-hand side of eq 2 dominates, and the rate is independent of the pH. At higher pH values,
the second term on the right-hand side becomes more dominant, and
the rate is dependent on the square root of the concentrations of
hydroxide and sodium ions.

The rate constants k1 and k2 are both functions
of temperature, which is described
by the Arrhenius equation. Therefore, the rate of dissolution of quartz
as a function of temperature is given by eq 17. 17  Equation 17 can be used to model the
data for the dissolution
of quartz in aqueous solutions as a function of temperature, pH, and
the concentration of sodium ions. This is discussed in the next section.

Fitting
the Proposed Theory to the Dissolution Data
Equation 17 was fitted
to the 285 data points from 14 different studies using quartz from
difference sources (details given in the Methodology section). Figure 6 shows the fitted values for the rate of dissolution against the
measured rates, showing that the correspondence between fitted values
and the measured values is good. The quality of the fit to the data
is good because the scatter is evenly placed around the line that
represents perfect correspondence between measured and fitted values.

Figure 6 Fitted
rates vs the measure data points for the entire data set
of 285 dissolution experiments from 14 different studies provided
by Bickmore et al.,12 showing that eq 17 is a good representation
of the data.

During the fitting procedure,
it appeared that activation energies Ea,1 and Ea,2 are
approximately the same. Consequently, these activation energies were
set to the same value.

The values of the fitted parameters are Ea,1 = Ea,2 = 140
kJ/mol, k1 = 0.04 mol2/(m4 s2), and k2 = 2.58
× 1010 m2/s2. The value of the
activation
energies must be interpreted with care because of the square-root
function in eq 17. As
the activation energies for both terms are the same, a common factor
of exp(−140 000/2RT) may be taken out
of the square root. The effective activation energy is Ea/2. Thus, to compare with other estimates of the activation
energy, the fitted value needs to be halved, that is, a value of 70
kJ/mol is obtained, which compares favorably with the values given
in eq 2.

The best
fit has values of 2.7 × 10–10 and
0.74 for the sum-of-squared-differences and the regression coefficient,
respectively. This result compares favorably with the sum-of-squared
errors of 2.3 × 10–10 and the regression coefficient
of 0.78 calculated by Rimstidt6 using eq 2 for the same data set.
The slight increase in values for the goodness of fit using eq 2 is because eq 2 was fitted using six adjustable
parameters, whereas eq 19 was fitted using three adjustable parameters.

The correspondence
between the data and the proposed theory is
illustrated in Figure 7 for specific data points at two temperatures. This figure indicates
that the proposed theory is a good description of the data.

Figure 7 Correspondence
between data for the rate of dissolution of quartz
at 25 and 70 °C and the fit of the theoretical model. Note that
the data points are at different concentrations of Na+ ions,
hence the depiction of the data only as points. The data shown are
from House and Orr,8 Bennett,9 and Knauss and Wolery.31 The fit of the theoretical model is given by eq 17.

The merits of eq 17 over eq 2 cannot
be
judged on the basis of parameter fitting alone, because eq 2 has no theoretical backing, it
is purely empirical. The reaction orders are predicted by the theory
in eq 17, and the functional
form is not the same; both these factors significantly constrain the
fitting procedure. However, the major advantage of eq 17 is the explanation of the mechanism
of dissolution, and that explanation is the yardstick by which eq 17 should be judged.

With this in mind, attention moves to other features and predictions
of the model. In the next section, these features and predictions
are discussed in the context of known but not yet explained data.

Features and Predictions of the Proposed Model
Five
features of the proposed theory of dissolution are discussed as supporting
evidence, namely, (i) the independent effect of Na+ ions,
(ii) the effect of heavy water, (iii) the prediction by eq 14 of a surface charge and a potential
difference across the Stern layer, (iv) the prediction of additional
transient effects due to the time dependence of eq 6, and (v) equilibrium. Each feature is discussed
in turn.

Independent Effect of Na+ Ions
The order
of reaction with respect to Na+ ions is 0.5, as shown in Figure 3. This result is
clearly consistent with eq 16, depending on the relative magnitudes of constants k1 and k2. Increasing
the concentrations of Na+ increases the magnitude of the
second term on the right-hand side of eq 16, and because of the square root functionality,
the order of reaction with respect to Na+ is 0.5, in agreement
with the experimental results.

Dissolution of Quartz in
Heavy Water
Another feature
of eq 16 that is worth
taking note of is that k1 is dependent
on the dissociation constant for water, Kw, whereas k2 is not. Casey et al.34 reported that the rate of dissolution of quartz
in 0.001 N DCl/D2O was 85% of the rate in 0.001 N HCl/H2O for five different temperatures in the range of 20–70
°C. Interestingly, a similar effect was not found in alkaline
solutions; the rate of dissolution in 0.001 N LiOD/D2O
was the same as that in 0.001 LiOH/H2O for three experiments
in the range of 20–40 °C.

These fascinating observations
are clearly explained by eq 16. In alkaline solutions, the second term on the right-hand
side of eq 16 indicates
that the rate is not dependent on the dissociation constant of water,
and the rates should be equal in both water and heavy water, which
is in agreement with the findings of Casey et al.34

In the acidic region, the first term on the right-hand
side of eq 16 dominates,
so the rate
of dissolution is proportional to Kw.
The value of Kw is lower in D2O, so the rate in the acid region should be retarded by the square
root of the ratio of these values, that is, by , which is equal
to 0.37. Thus, the rate
in heavy water should be 37% of the rate in water. In spite of the
result that the measured reduction in rate was only to 85%, which
is less than the predicted reduction of 37%, eq 16 clearly provides insight into the effect
of heavy water in the different pH regions. Further experimental work
in this regard would be justified.

Zeta Potential at the Quartz–Solution
Interface
An interesting aspect of the proposed model is
that it predicts the
potential difference across the Stern layer, Δϕ. This
prediction of the potential difference can be used as a further test
of the proposed model by comparing the calculated values of the zeta
potential with the measured values as a function of the pH. To do
this, the relationship between the potential difference, Δϕ,
and the zeta potential, ζ, needs to be established.

The
structure of the interface between quartz and water is sketched in Figure 8. The potential difference
across the Stern layer is related to the charge on the surface, as
given by eq 4. The charge
at the surface, which is generated by the creation of an excess of
charged vacancies of one sign on the surface by dissolution, can be
obtained by combining eqs 4 and 14. This is achieved by taking logarithms
of both sides of eq 14 and substituting the definition of variable y to
yield a function of Δϕ. Substituting this expression for
Δϕ into eq 4 yields eq 18. 18  

Figure 8 Electrified interface
at the quartz surface. The zeta potential
is approximately the potential difference between the bulk solution,
ϕa, and the outer Helmholtz plane, ϕohp. εrw represents the relative permittivity of water.

The concentration of hydroxide
ions is related to the concentration
of hydronium ions by the equilibrium constant for water dissociation,
that is, [OH–]ohp = Kw/[H+]ohp. Using
this relationship, eq 18 can be rearranged to give eq 19. 19  The concentration
of hydroxide ions in the
alkaline region is equal to the concentration of Na+ ions,
so the term k4[Na+]ohp/[OH–]ohp is constant in this region.
Constant k3 is given by k⃗–,1ν–/k⃗+ν+Kw, and
constant k4 is given by k⃗–,2ν–/k⃗+ν+.

The surface charge is balanced
by the charge at the ohp,41,42 given by eq 20. 20  The charge at the outer-Helmholtz
plane due
to mobile ions in the solution, σohp, is given by
the Gouy–Chapman relationship, eq 21(42,43) 21  The symbol
ϕohp represents
the potential at the ohp (V) relative to the bulk solution, I represents the ionic strength (kmol/m3), ε0 the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10–12 F/m), and εrw the relative permittivity of water
(78).

The concentration of H+ in the diffuse layer
of the
solution is dependent on the potential, reflecting the electrostatic
work required to bring a proton from the bulk to another position
within the diffuse layer. Consequently, the concentration of H+ in solution at the outer-Helmholtz plane is given by eq 22(42) 22  Equations 21–24 represent
four equations
in four unknown variables: ϕohp, [H+]ohp, σohp, and σs. These
equations are implicit, and need to be solved numerically.

The
zeta potential, ζ, is usually taken as ϕohp, the potential at the ohp relative to the bulk solution.44−46 By solving eqs 19–22 numerically for ϕohp, the zeta
potential as a function pH can be determined.

The data of James
and Healy47 are shown
in Figure 9. They adjusted
the pH of their solution using KOH. Bearing in mind that the action
of K+ is deemed to be the same as that of Na+,14 this means that the term [Na+]ohp/[OH–]ohp in eq 19 (or in this case [K+]ohp/[OH–]ohp) is
constant in the alkaline region, because the concentrations of K+ and OH– are equivalent to each other. In
the acid region, the first term on the right-hand side of eq 19 dominates. Thus, one
expects eq 19 to have
the same form as the data: the zeta potential decreases with increasing
pH in the acid region and then flattens onto a plateau as the pH increases
further into the alkaline region.

Figure 9 Correspondence between the proposed model
and the data of James
and Healy47 for quartz. Fitted parameters
are k3 = 180 050, k4 = 2 × 10–6, C0 = 0.043 F/m2.

The modeling of the zeta potential of mineral surfaces as
a function
of pH has not generally been successful. That the proposed model describes
both the dissolution data (Figure 7) and the zeta potential (Figure 9) provides significant support in favor of
the model.

Transient Effects
Knauss and Wolery31 observed a transient period in their continuous
dissolution
tests in which the rate of dissolution changed. This transient period
occurred over tens of days, as shown in Figure 10. This transient behavior cannot be explained
by adsorption phenomena, which are frequently assumed to be much faster,
acting within minutes. House and Hickinbotham48 also identified a “fast” reaction that occurred in
the initial 10 h and a “slow” subsequent reaction. Such
transients have been interpreted as evidence for the dissolution of ultrafine material on the surface,
the creation of etch pits, or the existence of an inhibiting “leach
layer”. Each of these mechanisms has been invoked frequently
without much evidence in their favor. The rise in dissolution rate
reported by Knauss and Wolery31 cannot
be accounted for by any of these previous explanations and undermines
all of them.

Figure 10 Change in rate of dissolution during the initial stages,
showing
that under some conditions the rate rises, whereas under other conditions
it falls. Data from Knauss and Wolery.31

The transient link between the
surface potential and the dissolution
rate, which forms the basis for the proposed model, provides an alternative
explanation. This link is expressed in eq 6. As the surface charge develops during the
initial stages of the test, the dissolution rate will be affected.
The surface potential, and hence the rate dissolution, changes before
the steady state (with respect to surface potential) is established.
That the surface potential does change is experimentally verified
by changes in the zeta potential, as is shown in Figure 5.

There are two paths
to reaching this stationary state, depending
on whether the initial surface potential is above or below the eventual
steady-state value. This is illustrated in Figure 11. The rate of dissolution is usually measured
as the rate of appearance of silica/silicon in solution. In the transient
analysis, the rate of silica appearance is given by r+. If the surface potential is initially above the stationary
state value, r+ will drop as the stationary
state is approached. However, if the surface potential is initially
below the stationary state value, r+ will
increase as the stationary state is approached.

Figure 11 Rates of removal of
the anions and cations from the surface. The
intersection between the two curves gives the condition for stoichiometric
dissolution. If the surface potential difference is initially above
that required for stoichiometric dissolution, say at point 1, the
potential initially decreases with time. As the rate is measured as
Si removal, r+, the measured rate decreases.
In contrast, if the surface potential difference is initially at point
2, the potential and the rate of dissolution initially rise.

Rimstidt and Barnes29 presented the
results shown in Figure 12. These data points show the appearance of silica in solution
as a function of time. The rate is initially high and then declines
until it reaches a steady value (constant slope). This experiment
can be described kinetically using the proposed model as follows.
The appearance of silica in solution is described by the mass balance
for the batch reactor, which, combined with the expression for the
rate of Si removal from the surface, becomes eq 23. 23  The change in surface potential, Δϕ,
with time is derived from eq 6. The combination of eqs 6, 10, and 13 yields eq 24. 24  This model has been fitted to the data, as
shown in Figure 12. The model is the line, and the data are the points. The model curve
successfully describes the change in rate in the initial phase of
the reaction, which lends further credence to the proposed model.
(Note that no sodium was present in the experiments by Rimstidt and
Barnes.29) Values for the parameters are
as follows: k⃗+[OH–] = 2 × 10–8; k⃗–[H+] = 7 × 10–13; Cd = 0.15 F/m2.

Figure 12 Increase in appearance
of Si in solution before the establishment
of a steady-state rate of dissolution. The points represent data from
Rimstidt and Barnes29 obtained at 105 °C
in distilled water, and the line represents the model, which is a
numerical solution of eqs 23 and 24.

The effect of the initial value for the surface potential
is illustrated
in Figure 13. If the
surface potential difference is higher than the stationary state (stoichiometric)
value, then the surface potential decreases, and with it, the initial
rate. However, if the surface potential difference is below the stationary
state value, the surface potential rises, and the initial rate increases.
This is the explanation for the results of Knauss and Wolery31 that are shown in Figure 10. The initial value of the surface potential
is determined by both the initial condition of the quartz surface
and the solution conditions. For example, the pretreatment of the
quartz material in either acid, alkali, or fluoride is likely to influence
the initial potential. Likewise, solutions that initially contain,
for example, high concentrations of silica will affect the initial
solution potential.

Figure 13 Effect of the initial value for the surface potential
difference.
(a) The initial potential is higher than the stoichiometric value,
so the rate initially decreases; (b) the initial potential is below
the stoichiometric value, so the rate initially increases.

This result, and the arguments presented in this
section, show
that the proposed model is able to account for the transient effects
measured for quartz, for both an initial fast rate and an initial
slow rate.

Equilibrium
A kinetic model must
fulfill the conditions
imposed by equilibrium. The equilibrium constant, K, for the dissolution of quartz and silica (eq 1) is given in eq 25, where the symbol a(...)
represents the activity of the particular species. The activity of
the solid is taken as unity. 25  To describe the
equilibrium,
the reverse terms for the reactions eqs 9 and 11 need to be included.
Thus, eq 10 becomes eq 26, and eq 12 becomes eq 27. 26   27  Solution
of these equations follows the same
methods as before: eqs 26, 27, and 7 represent
three equations in three unknown variables, r+, r–, and y, and are solved by first substituting eqs 26 and 27 in eq 7, solving for y, and then substituting the resulting expression back into eq 26. Following this procedure
gives eq 28 for the
rate of dissolution both close to and far from equilibrium. 28  At equilibrium,
rate r+ is zero, so eq 28 becomes eq 29. 29  SiOOH+ is not the final stable
species in solution; it reacts with water to form H4SiO4 by reaction 30. 30  The equilibrium constant for eq 30, Kc, is given by eq 31. 31  The combination of eqs 29 and 31 yields eq 32, which is the desired
equilibrium expression for the overall reaction. 32  Thus, constant Kck⃗+k⃗–,1/k⃖+k⃖–,1 is equivalent
to K, the equilibrium
constant for the overall reaction, assuming the concentrations are
a useful approximation of the activities in solution. Therefore, the
proposed model is consistent with the thermodynamic constraint.

Conclusions
The work presented here has proposed a novel
theory of dissolution
of quartz and silica. The dissolution is envisaged as occurring by
the separate, parallel, removal of oxygen and silicon units, both
of which are dependent on the potential difference across the Stern
layer. The removal of these units creates surface vacancies, which
is the source of the surface charge giving rise to the potential difference
across the Stern layer. Thus, like the models of corrosion, dissolution
both causes and is dependent on the potential difference across the
Stern layer.

This theory is used to derive a specific model
for the dissolution
of quartz. This model successfully describes the following phenomena:1. It is shown that
this model describes
the 285 experiments collated by Bickmore (see Figure 6);

2. It predicts the fractional orders of
reaction observed (see eq 16);

3. It describes
the independent effect
of Na+ ions (and by extension, K+ and Li+ ions) (see eq 16);

4. It describes the
effect of heavy water
(see eq 16);

5. It describes the zeta potential
of
the quartz–water interface as a function of potential (see Figure 9);

6. It describes the transient effects
at shorter time scales, where the rate either initially increases
or initially decreases (see Figures 12 and 13).

7. It is consistent with the equilibrium
expression (see eq 32).



No other model or theory of dissolution
has been successful in
describing all of these phenomena.

Methodology
The
methodology consists of two parts: (i) the source of data and
(ii) the procedure for fitting of the proposed model to the data.

Source
of Data on the Dissolution of Quartz
The data
were compiled by Dove11 and Bickmore12 and are the same as those used by Rimstidt6 in the regression of eq 2. It consists of the results of 285 dissolution experiments
reported in 14 scientific papers: Brady and Walther,7 House and Orr,8 Bennett,9 Dove,11 Bennett et
al.;13 Rimstidt and Barnes,29 Schwartzentruber et al.,30 Knauss and Wolery,31 Murphy
and Helgeson,32 Blum et al.,33 Casey et al.,34 Dove
and Crerar,35 Hellmann,36 and Tester et al.37 The data
can be obtained from the supporting material provided at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2015.07.030.

These data consist of the rates of dissolution at different
values of temperature, pH, and sodium concentration. The temperatures
range from 23 to 430 °C, the pH of the solution at the temperature
of the experiment ranges from 1.1 to 12.3, and the concentrations
of sodium ions in solution range from 0 to 0.52 M. The rate of dissolution
in this data set covers 10 orders of magnitude.

The effect of
potassium ions on the rate of dissolution is approximately
the same as that of sodium ions. The data set6,11,12 does not distinguish between potassium and
sodium and lumps them together under the heading of sodium. This is
acceptable in light of the results reported by Dove.14

Fitting of Parameters to Nonlinear Models
The functional
form of the kinetic expression that is derived in the next section
is nonlinear. Rimstidt6 fitted eq 2 by separating the data
into two portions and fitting the first term of the right-hand side
of eq 2 to one portion
and the second term to the other portion. Separating the procedure
into two portions allowed Rimstidt to linearize each term of eq 2(6) The proposed theory derived in the next section cannot be linearized
in this manner, so a single equation is fitted to all 285 data points
for the rate data. The parameters are estimated by minimizing the
sum of squared differences, χ2, given by eq 3(38) 33  The symbol yi is the data point at coordinate x(pHi, [Na+]i, Ti), y is the predicted value at that same point
given the parameters a0...aM–1. There are N data points and M parameters.

The minimization
is performed iteratively,
using a numerical minimization routine38 and implemented in Excel. The value χ2 is in itself
a measure of the goodness of fit. Another measure is the regression
coefficient, R2, defined by eq 34. 34
