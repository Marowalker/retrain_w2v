Single-molecule
detection by surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is of interest for
the sensor development field. An important aspect of optimizing the
materials used in SERS-based sensors is the ability to have a high
density of “hot spots” that enhance the SERS sensitivity
to the single-molecule level. Photodeposition of gold (Au) nanoparticles
through electric-field-directed self-assembly on a periodically proton-exchanged
lithium niobate (PPELN) substrate provides conditions to form well-ordered
microscale features consisting of closely packed Au nanoparticles.
The resulting Au nanoparticle microstructure arrays (microarrays)
are plasmon-active and support nonresonant single-molecule SERS at
ultralow concentrations (<10–9–10–13 M) with excitation power densities <1 ×
10–3 W cm–2 using wide-field imaging.
The microarrays offer excellent SERS reproducibility, with an intensity
variation of <7.5% across the substrate. As most biomarkers and
molecules do not support resonance enhancement, this work demonstrates
that PPELN is a suitable template for high-sensitivity, nonresonant
sensing applications.

Introduction
Single-molecule (SM)
surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is
enabled by the large electromagnetic field enhancement “hot
spots” that occur between closely packed nanoparticles. Thus,
an objective in developing nanomaterials for single-molecule SERS
is to prepare well-defined and reproducible nanoparticle assemblies
that support the formation of a large number of hot spots.1−3 Through ferroelectric nanolithography, static electric field distributions
can be engineered in a ferroelectric crystal to direct bottom-up assembly
and nanoparticle deposition at the surface.3−6 This results in substrates with
closely packed nanoparticles in well-defined and reproducible microstructure
arrays (microarrays).3−6

Lithium niobate (LN) is a ferroelectric crystal that enables
selective
polarization-driven deposition of metallic nanoparticles due to its
large reversible spontaneous polarization along the crystallographic Z-axis.4,7 Electric-field poling and chemical
patterning have been used to tailor surface charge and reactivity
on a LN surface for the fabrication of metallic nanostructures.8−11 Furthermore, LN has been shown to be cytocompatible with several
cell lines and nanoparticles deposited on LN have been shown to support
SERS.7,12−19 Periodically proton-exchanged lithium niobate (PPELN) templates
have been previously applied for directed self-assembly of silver
(Ag) nanoparticles.8,11 PPELN formed through one-dimensional
chemical patterning of LN via proton exchange results in a surface
with alternating PE and LN stripes.8 Proton
exchange of a LN surface through reactive ion-etched (RIE) mask openings
results in lateral diffusion (LD) of protons under the mask and leads
to RIE and LD regions in the PE area.11,20−22 Gold (Au) nanoparticles have been shown to reduce from aqueous HAuCl4 preferentially in RIE regions depending on the Au3+ ion concentration.20

In this work,
the formation of microarrays of Au nanoparticles
on PPELN (Au-PPELN) is shown to be applicable to nonresonant single-molecule
SERS using wide-field imaging. The use of wide-field SERS imaging
here aids in overcoming general obstacles in single-molecule SERS
detection in standard micro Raman systems by increasing the spatial
resolution limitation, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the imaged area
of the sample to ∼20 × 20 μm2, while
also decreasing the acquisition time, which enables the detection
of multiplexed SERS signals from probe molecules.23,24 We demonstrate that Au-PPELN enables nonresonant single-molecule
SERS using low probe molecule concentrations (<10–9–10–13 M) and a low laser power density
(<1 × 10–3 W cm–2). The
use of low power density aids in avoiding problematic photodegradation
products, which are expected to have a SERS signal comparable to or
even larger than the nonresonant target analyte.25 Nonresonant single-molecule SERS detection is important
in biodetection applications as most biomarkers and molecules do not
support resonance enhancement.26,27 Here, fluorescence
imaging and fluorescence lifetime studies have been used to investigate
the localization of the probe molecule at the Au-PPELN surface to
establish that the substrate simultaneously supports surface fluorescence
luminescence and SERS. This work demonstrates that Au-PPELN templates
are suitable for high-sensitivity analytical applications.

Results
and Discussion
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of the
PPELN surface was
undertaken to determine the surface topography of the substrate’s
surface prior to the photodeposition of the Au nanoparticles (Figures 1a,b and S2, Supporting Information). The AFM topography
image (Figure 1a) and
corresponding line profile (Figure 1b) show topographical features assigned to the PE regions
of the PPELN surface that comprise the central RIE region and the
adjacent LD regions, as indicated in Figure 1b, the insertion of protons into the crystal
lattice and resulting strain leading to swelling of the LD regions.21 The AFM topography image (Figure 1e) of two microarrays of the Au-PPELN surface
shows that the arrays consist of a closely packed arrangement of Au
nanoparticles. The deposition coverage was nonuniform over the arrays,
e.g., the highest Au coverage occurred at the edges of the RIE regions
(as shown in Figure 1d,f), in line with a previous report.20 The average height of the deposited Au nanoparticle layer was determined
to be 40.00 ± 4.23 nm by subtracting line profiles (n = 10) before and after deposition. Measurements of 10 Au particles
located on the PPELN surface reveal that the height of individual
nanoparticles is 20.40 ± 7.60 nm, whereas the width is 135.20
± 29.60 nm as a result of tip broadening. Analysis of the AFM
topography images shows that the surface roughness (root mean square
of 1.38 μm × 1.38 μm areas (n =
4)) of the LN and LD regions remains unchanged following Au deposition:
2.07 ± 1.06 and 0.75 ± 0.21 nm, respectively, before deposition
and 2.46 ± 0.95 and 0.69 ± 0.19 nm, respectively, after
Au deposition. The roughness values are significantly increased for
the RIE regions from 2.40 ± 0.86 to 8.79 ± 1.89 nm, as a
result of the Au deposition.

Au deposition;
marked regions are lateral diffusion (LD), lithium niobate (LN), and
reactive ion etching (RIE) of PPELN. (e) AFM topography image (10
μm × 10 μm area) of the (Au-PPELN) substrate showing
the presence of Au nanoparticles in the RIE region and the corresponding
AFM line scan is shown in (f).

Optical scattering spectra recorded for the Au-PPELN substrate
(Figure 2a) showed
a broad band centered at 650 nm. Rhodamine B (RhB) possesses an absorption
band located at 550 nm (Figure 2a). Nonresonant Stokes-shifted Raman scattering of RhB occurs
when using a 632.8 nm excitation wavelength (λex),
which overlaps with the surface plasmon resonance wavelength of Au
nanoparticles, resulting in nonresonant SERS. The Stokes-shifted Raman
scattering of RhB is spectrally separated from the fluorescence of
the probe molecule (centered at ca. 575 nm) (Figure 2a).

Figure 2 (a) Optical scattering spectrum (brown) from
Au-PPELN substrate
shown along with the optical absorption spectrum (blue) and fluorescence
emission spectrum (green) from RhB deposited onto a (dielectric) glass
slide. The insert shows a schematic of the molecular structure of
the probe molecule. (b) Fluorescence lifetime studies recorded using
a millimolar concentration of the probe molecule RhB on PPELN with
and without Au. The lifetime decay trace of the fluorescence emission
from Au-PPELN substrate with RhB showing a larger fluorescence signal
intensity and a shortened lifetime compared with only PPELN with RhB.
Single exponential fits to the decay traces are shown in red and yellow.
A shortened lifetime (τ = 2.2 ns) was found for the Au-PPELN
substrate with RhB compared with PPELN with RhB without Au nanoparticles
(τ = 3.5 ns). The residual standard deviation indicates an average
value close to 0. The observed fluorescence intensity array (yellow
line) arising from areas of the substrate where Au is deposited. (c)
SERS spectra recorded at 632.8 nm. The green region shows Raman bands
arising from the PPELN substrate, which are below ∼1000 cm–1. The blue line shows the Raman spectrum above ∼1000
cm–1 arising from PPELN with RhB, whereas the green
line shows the SERS spectrum for RhB on an Au-PPELN surface. The yellow
region shows the three peaks that we used to calculate the enhancement
factor (EF).

The interaction between
Au nanoparticles and the probe molecule
was investigated by fluorescence lifetime imaging and spectroscopy
using 470 nm excitation (Figures 2b and S3, Supporting Information).
A strong fluorescence enhancement and a shortened lifetime (τ
= 2.2 ns) were found for the Au-PPELN substrate with RhB compared
to that in PPELN with RhB without Au nanoparticles (τ = 3.5
ns), as shown in Figure 2b.

The Raman scattering spectrum of Au-PPELN with the probe
molecule
RhB present (Figure 2c) shows several strong Raman scattering bands located between 1100
and 1800 cm–1. These bands are assigned to the probe
molecule, as Raman bands arising from PPELN occur only below 1000
cm–1.11,31−33 The Raman scattering spectrum for the probe molecule on the PPELN
surface without Au nanoparticles is characterized by the absence of
Raman peaks for RhB (Figure 2c). The absence of RhB Raman peaks indicates that the Au nanoparticles
enhance the Raman scattering through plasmon enhancement.34,35 This confirms that the SERS signal originates in RIE regions where
Au nanoparticles have been deposited. The SERS intensity of the three
characteristic RhB peaks in the yellow-shaded region (Figure 2c) was determined to vary <7.5%
across the Au-PPELN sample (n = 10 locations).

A near-diffraction limit spot size (λex = 632.8
nm, confocal volume 0.8 fL) was then used to focus the excitation
beam onto a small region (<1 μm in diameter) of a single
Au microarray (Figure S4, Supporting Information).
A selection of SERS spectra recorded sequentially every 50 ms using
a nanomolar RhB concentration (Figure 3a) showed an SERS spectral blinking behavior, e.g.,
random SERS intensity fluctuations in band position and intensity.
Averaging the spectra over the entire time sequence produces a SERS
spectrum with the same spectral features as those observed in SERS
and Raman spectra of the probe molecule recorded at higher concentrations
(shown in Figure 2c).
This confirms that the spectral blinking arises from the probe molecule.

Figure 3 Nonresonant
SERS from Au-PPELN with RhB, recorded at λex = 632.8
nm using a near-diffraction focused beam and a nanomolar
concentration of the probe molecule. (a) Contour plot of Raman intensity
as a function of time (the spectral wavelength range is shown approximately
by the region highlighted in the yellow region in Figure 2c using spectral acquisition
time of 50 ms). The vertical line profiles show the reproducibility
of the SERS signature of RhB over 30 s (the yellow profile shows the
reproducibility of the SERS signature at 1350 cm–1; the purple profile shows the reproducibility of the SERS signature
at 1275 cm–1; the orange profile shows the reproducibility
of the SERS signature at 1200 cm–1). The average
(red) and sum (blue) of all spectra show excellent spectral agreement
in the peak position and relative intensities with SERS spectra of
RhB recorded using high concentrations. The variance (green) in the
spectral wavelength and intensity from the blinking Raman spectra
is also shown. (b) log–log plot of Raman intensity vs on and
off-times (derived from (a)). Inset shows a plot of Raman intensity
as a function of time.

A series of statistical schemes were applied to examine the
SERS
blinking, specifically sum (Figure 3a (blue spectrum)), averaging (Figure 3a (red spectrum)), and variance (Figure 3a (green spectrum)).
These schemes all show SERS spectra that match the Raman spectrum
for RhB. The variance spectrum shows a series of narrow peak widths
at full half maxima compared with the average spectrum and the spectrum
obtained by summing all of the blinking Raman spectra together (sum
spectrum). The observed peak narrowing in the variance spectrum can
be potentially applied as an analysis tool for single-molecule Raman
spectra in addition to summing and averaging schemes.

The observed
blinking (Figure 3a)
can be assigned to arise from plasmon-enhanced Raman
scattering of single or few RhB molecules. Power-law statistics have
been used to measure and analyze single-molecule SERS blinking events.33,36−38 A log–log plot of the on- and off-times of
the blinking Raman intensities is shown in Figure 3b. The plot for the SERS on-time shows a
power-law dependence given by Pon(t) = Ata-on, in line with previous reports for single-molecule SERS.33,36,37 For the SERS off-time, a truncated
power law Poff(t) = Ata-off e–t/Γ fit was applied, where Pon,off(t) are the probability
distributions of the on and off SERS events for a duration time, t, A is a normalization coefficient, a-on and a-off are power-law exponents
for the on and off SERS events, and Γ is the truncation time
in the power law.33,36 The truncation time in the SERS
off-time is given by Γ = r/2kBT, where r is the random walk time to overcome the
energy barrier between emissive and nonemissive states.33,36 This energy barrier may be attributed to a periodic electromagnetic
field enhancement at hot spots. The nonzero truncation time obtained
from power-law fitting (Figure 3b) suggests the presence of nanoscale plasmonic hot spots
on the microarrays where single or few probe molecules are randomly
trapped.33,39,40

Wide-field
nonresonant SERS and dark-field imaging (Figure 4) were used to increase the
imaged area of the sample and probe more microarray hot spots. The
laser excitation beam was expanded to 13 mm to fill the objective
aperture to enable SERS imaging of multiple Au microarrays. Imaging
was done for a region of the sample where microarrays end was performed
using wide-field nonresonant SERS and dark-field techniques. The SERS
image (Figure 4a) shows
areas of high intensity in red, which occur within RIE area of the
sample where Au nanoparticles have been photoreduced to form Au microarrays.
The spatial intensity profiles in the horizontal and vertical directions
in the SERS image are shown in the top and left panels of Figure 4a, respectively.
The features in the dark-field image in Figure 4a, assigned to the presence of Au nanoparticles,
coincide with areas that show high SERS signals. This further supports
the conclusion that the SERS signal arises from the Au microarrays
present on RIE regions.

Figure 4 Nonresonant SERS from Au-PPELN with a nanomolar
RhB concentration
using an expanded excitation laser spot, λex = 632.8
nm. (a) SERS and dark-field imaging recorded at the same sample area.
The nonresonant SERS image (top) shows red stripelike features that
are areas of high SERS intensity. A dark-field image (below) of the
same sample area shows the presence of stripelike features assigned
to Au (on the right side of the image), whereas to the left is an
area of the sample corresponding to where there is no Au deposited
on the PPELN surface. The Raman spectrum is clearly seen on the sample
on areas where Au nanoparticles are photodeposited. (b) SERS image
(top) from an area of the sample where Au nanoparticle microarrays
are present over the entire excitation area. The SERS image shows
the presence of over six Au microstructured stripelike features (labeled
(A)–(E)) that possess SERS intensity distributions. A slit
of width 2.5 μm was placed in front of the image, and light
was dispersed using a grating. The dispersed SERS spectral image (lower)
shows several lines replicating SERS arising from different linear
Au stripe positions, labeled (A)–(E). The sum of the SERS spectra
from the entire image is shown in the top panel (red spectrum, labeled
sum, which is the total sum of SERS spectra from each of five different
Au microarray stripes, (A)–(E) confirming that the Raman is
from the probe molecule).

A separate area of the sample where the Au microarrays cover
the
whole excitation area was then imaged. The image shows SERS intensity
from multiple Au microarrays (labeled (A)–(E) in Figure 4b). The spatial intensity profiles
in the vertical direction of the wide-field SERS image are shown in
the left panel of Figure 4b to allow the identification of Au microarrays. In the top
panel of Figure 4b,
the red spectrum shows the sum of the averaged SERS spectra from each
Au microarray (Figure 4b(A)–(E)) to form a SERS spectrum with features in line with
those of the Raman spectrum of the probe molecule.

A series
of different concentrations was studied ranging from micro-
to femtomolar concentrations. SERS images for each concentration were
recorded sequentially using a 50 ms acquisition time (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The SERS
signal occurred less frequently at lower concentrations of the probe
molecule. SERS spectra recorded sequentially every 30 ms using a femtomolar
RhB concentration (Figure 5a) also showed a blinking behavior. The variance spectrum
over the entire time sequence matches the spectral features for the
SERS and Raman spectra of the probe molecule recorded at higher concentrations
(shown in Figure 2c).
This confirms that the spectral blinking arises from the probe molecule.
The binning intensity (Figure 5b) as a function of the Raman shift demonstrates that the
most dominant peaks (1384 and 1568 cm–1) match those
of the Raman spectra for RhB.

Figure 5 Nonresonant single-molecule SERS from Au-PPELN
with a femtomolar
RhB concentration using an expanded excitation laser spot, λex = 632.8 nm. (a) Contour plot of Raman intensity as a function
of time using a spectral acquisition time of 30 ms. The vertical line
profile shows the variance of the fluctuation intensity of RhB with
femtomolar concentration for 3 s. The SERS spectrum (red) was calculated
from the variance of 100 successive SERS spectra shown in the contour
plot. (b) The binning intensity as a function of the Raman shift calculated
from the contour plot of Raman intensity in (a).

The Au-PPELN SERS enhancement factor (EF) was calculated
using
EF = (ISERS/NSurf)/(IRS/Nvol), where Nvol is the average number of
molecules in the scattering volume, ISERS is the single-molecule SERS intensity, IRS is the Raman intensity for the same probe molecule, and NSurf is the average number of adsorbed molecules
in the scattering volume for the SERS experiments.40 An average EF of ∼1 × 1011 was estimated,
calculated using EF questions and 1149, 1285, and 1354 cm–1 peaks of RhB. The occurrence of such a large EF may be associated
the closely packed arrangement of Au nanoparticles on the PPELN surface
(Figure 1), which results
in conditions that yield small nanoparticle separation distances and
high electromagnetic hot spot intensities. The presence of such hot
spots likely results in a strong SERS signal, enabling SM detection
using normal Raman excitation conditions. Previous COMSOL simulations
of line profiles of nanoparticles deposited on PPELN showed evidence
for the presence of plasmonic hot spots.31

Conclusions
In conclusion, microarrays of Au nanoparticles
were prepared by
photodeposition on a periodically proton-exchanged lithium niobate
substrate (Au-PPELN). This Au-PPELN substrate is plasmon-active, supporting
nonresonant single-molecule Raman spectroscopy at ultralow concentrations
(<10–9–10–13 M), with
the substrate supporting a Raman enhancement factor of ca. 1011. The plasmon-active substrates enabled SERS imaging to be
performed with low power density (<1 × 10–3 W cm–2) using a wide-field imaging technique.
The substrates reported here potentially exhibit Raman enhancement
through both electromagnetic enhancement via plasmonic hot spots and
chemical enhancement. This high-sensitivity SERS platform can be used
to develop substrates for ultra-sensitive analytical sensing applications.

Experimental
Methods
Five hundred micrometers thick −Z cut optical
grade congruent LN crystals were used to fabricate PPELN templates,
as previously described.8,20 The selective chemical
patterning of the LN surface was conducted by exposing the samples
to pure benzoic acid for 24 h at 200 °C through 2.0 μm
wide RIE openings in a titanium mask. The titanium mask was subsequently
removed by etching in dilute hydrofluoric acid for a few seconds.
The resulting periodic pattern at the crystal surface consisted of
pure LN and PE stripes, with widths of 0.95 and 5.15 μm, respectively.
Prior to photodeposition, the samples were sonicated for 20 min each
in acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water before being dried with
compressed nitrogen. The PPELN samples were placed on a glass slide,
and 150 μL of 0.01 M HAuCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich) was pipetted
onto the surface. The samples were illuminated with a 254 nm UV light
source (11SC-2, Spectroline) located 2 cm above the surface for 20
min. After illumination, the samples were immersed in deionized water
for 1 min and then blown dry with nitrogen. The samples were reused
following the cleaning steps described above, with an additional step
of gently rubbing the sample with lens paper soaked in isopropanol
before the acetone and isopropanol sonication steps. Amplitude modulation
atomic force microscopy (AFM) (MFP-3D, Asylum Research) was used to
probe the surface topography of each sample before and after photodeposition
with PPP-NCH cantilevers having a typical resonant frequency of ∼310
kHz and spring constant of ∼40 N m–1 (nanosensors).

Rhodamine B (RhB) was used as a probe molecule to investigate the
plasmonic properties of the Au microarrays. RhB was deposited by immersing
the sample in different aqueous concentrations of RhB for 24 h, followed
by dipping in deionized water for 5 min to wash off any excess probe
molecules. Microspectroscopy instrumentation (Figure S1, Supporting Information) consisting of a spectrograph
(IsoPlane 630) attached to a back-illuminated EMCCD (ProEM-HS) 512BX3
charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a microscope (Olympus IX71)
was used to acquire Raman spectra, fluorescence spectra, and fluorescence
images. Wide-field SERS imaging experiments were implemented using
a homemade telescope system designed for a 632.8 nm wavelength and
attached to the illumination port of the microscope. The samples were
illuminated through a 100× 0.8 NA objective. Employing wide-field
illumination with a spot diameter of ∼40 μm and a pixel
density of 247 × 247 pixels, integration time was 3–30
s, with 30–50 ms acquisition times. The excitation laser power
density was <0.08 MW cm–2, and the spatial resolution
was 116 nm per pixel.

Fluorescence lifetime experiments were
conducted using a 470 nm
excitation laser and millimolar concentration of RhB, whereas the
fluorescence imaging studies were established by using 470 and 532
nm excitation lasers with a millimolar concentration of RhB. The microscope
was also equipped with two single-photon counting avalanche photodiodes
with a Hanbury Brown–Twiss configuration for time-resolved
measurements.28−30 All data acquisition, dark-field images, fluorescence
images, and wide-field SERS images were constructed using LightField
software (Princeton Instruments, version 5.3). Data processing, such
as averaging, summing, variance, data binning, and generating contour
plots, were performed using codes written in MATLAB (MathWorks, version
16a).
