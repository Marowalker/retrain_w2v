In
this study, three typical impact-protective materials, D3O,
PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION were chosen to explore the dependences of
rheological and compression mechanical properties on the internal
cellular structures with polymer matrix characteristics, which were
examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analyses, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive
spectroscopy. The rheological property of these three foaming materials
were examined using a rheometer, and the mechanical property in a
compression mode was further examined using an Instron universal tensile
testing machine. The dependences of rheological parameters, such as
dynamic moduli, normalized moduli, and loss tangent, on angular frequency,
and the dependences of mechanical properties in compression, such
as the degree of strain-hardening, hysteresis, and elastic recovery,
on the strain rate for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION can be well-correlated
with their internal cellular structural parameters, revealing, for
example, that D3O and PORON XRD exhibit simultaneously high strength
and great energy loss in a high-frequency impact, making them suitable
for use as soft, close-fitting materials; however, DEFLEXION dissipates
much energy whether it suffers a large strain rate or not, making
it suitable for use as a high-risk impact-protective material. The
rheometry and compression tests used in this study can provide the
basic references for selecting and characterizing certain impact-protective
materials for applications.

1 Introduction
Impact-protective
materials are a type of foam, which can absorb
and distribute the force of direct impacts to exposed areas as a result
of fall, blow, or other sudden impact.1−3 Traditional impact-protective
materials have drawbacks such as rigidity, inflexibility, and heaviness,
which restrict their wide applications in the modern era, whereas,
impact-protective materials with comfort, flexibility, and light weight
are widely used in military equipment,4 sporting goods,5,6 medical equipment,7 household appliances, and so on. Shear-thickening fluids,
impact-hardening polymers, and materials with negative Poisson’s
ratio are thought to be potential candidates for impact-protective
materials.8−18 Shear-thickening as a typical non-Newtonian flowing behavior results
from dilation and jamming of suspended particles in dense suspensions8,9 or arises from the formation of particle clusters in moderate concentrated
suspensions induced by lubrication hydrodynamics,10,11 in which the viscosity steeply increases once the applied shear
rate is beyond a critical value.10,12,13 Because shear-thickening occurs under some specific
conditions and fluids might easily flow out once the fluid foam composites
are destroyed, their practical applications are still limited.

Impact-hardening polymers can significantly achieve impact protection
because of their particular and excellent smart softness–stiffness
switch performance.14 Several commercial
impact-hardening polymers are practically applied as impact-protective
materials. As an impact-protective material, D3O invented by Dr. Palmer
in 2004 is being hailed as one of the top ten future materials. D3O
behaves soft and flexible in its normal state; however, when impacted
by a force it locks itself, disperses energy, and then returns to
its normal state.15,16 D3O molecule keeps as a commercial
secret, belonging to “the expanding foam” material. D3O is also a kind
of “smart molecule” composed of a single material with
impact resistance.17 Another impact-protective
material, PORON XRD (Rogers Corporation, USA), shows excellent resistance
to compression deformation, absorbing 90% of the energy even at a
high-frequency impact. PORON XRD appears to be an open-cell urethane
foam. PORON XRD shows softness and flexibility when at rest because
the glass transition temperature of the urethane molecules is low;
whereas PORON XRD shows stiffness when impacted quickly because the
glass transition temperature drops.15 The
third impact-protective material, DEFLEXION (Dow Corning, USA), is
worthy of a great emphasis, showing a strong energy-absorption ability.
As a flexible silicone sheet, DEFLEXION is made of silicon. To a hard
impact like a bullet shot, the molecules in the shot area in DEFLEXION
gather to make it instantly turn into a rocklike solid. DEFLEXION
disperses and absorbs the impact energy and can be used in a bulletproof
vest.18

The abovementioned three
impact-protective materials, D3O, PORON
XRD, and DEFLEXION, have received a great deal of attention. However,
the relationship between the internal cell structures and the rheological
and mechanical properties of these impact-protective materials is
not well-understood yet. In this work, the internal cell structures
of D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION were first examined using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM); second, their rheological properties were
examined using a rheometer in the dynamic oscillatory mode, and third,
their mechanical properties in the compression mode were examined
using an Instron universal tensile testing machine. The influences
of the internal cell structures, such as cell type, cell size, size
distribution, and cell volume fraction, on the rheological and mechanical
properties of D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION are discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemical Compositions and
Cross-Linking Degrees
Three impact-protective materials used
for this study are illustrated
in Figure 1. For D3O
(D3O, UK), the internal orange color D3O-molded knee cup was taken
as the sample. For PORON XRD (Rogers, USA), the yellow color PORON
XRD was taken as the sample. For DEFLEXION (Dow Corning, USA), the
internal gray color DEFLEXION was taken as the sample. Figure S1 shows the Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION. It can be seen that
the FTIR spectra of D3O and PORON XRD are more close to each other.
For D3O and PORON XRD, the absorption band located at 3325 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of N–H
bonds that form intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The absorption band
at 1725 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching vibration
of C=O bonds. The absorption band at 1530 cm–1 corresponds to the N–H deformation. The absorption band at
1217 cm–1 is attributed to the asymmetric stretching
vibration of C–O–C bonds of ester groups. The above
result indicates that D3O and PORON XRD are polyurethane foams. The
absorption band at 1085 cm–1 for DEFLEXION is attributed
to the symmetric stretching vibration of Si–O–Si bonds.
The absorption bands at 2958 and 2869 cm–1 are indicative
of the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the methyl
group, respectively. The FTIR spectrum of DEFLEXION is highly consistent
with that of polydimethylsiloxane. Moreover, SEM with energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) was used to obtain the SEM–EDS spectrum
of DEFLEXION, and the SEM–EDS spectrum shown in Figure S2 indicates that DEFLEXION contains silicon.
Therefore, the material in DEFLEXION is a kind of silicone rubber.
It is interesting to find that the SEM–EDS spectrum of PORON
XRD indicates that PORON XRD also contains silicon. Figure S3 shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves
for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION taken under nitrogen and air atmosphere.
It can be observed from Figure S3a that
the thermal degradation for D3O and PORON XRD under a nitrogen atmosphere
is consistent with that of polyurethane and very possible polyurethane/SiO2 composite, respectively. DEFLEXION shows a single-step thermal
decomposition, demonstrating a single component in the sample, whereas
D3O and PORON XRD show a multiple-step decomposition. As shown in Figure S3b, D3O can fully burn out in air at
600 °C, whereas 17 wt % of mass remains for DEFLEXION in air
and 11 wt % of mass remains for PORON XRD in air. These results indicate
that the Si contents are different in PORON XRD and DEFLEXION, which
is consistent with the SEM–EDS spectra shown in Figure S2. Overall, it can be concluded that
the materials in D3O and PORON XRD are polyurethane-based foams, whereas
the material in DEFLEXION is silicone rubber. The difference between
PORON XRD and D3O is that, PORON XRD contains possibly SiO2 particles as fillers.

Figure 1 Illustrative images showing the locations of
D3O, PORON XRD, and
DEFLEXION in the commercial impact-protective products.

To examine the cross-linking degrees, the solubility
of the three
samples in the respective good solvents according to their chemical
compositions was conducted, and the results are shown in Figure S4. D3O and PORON XRD cannot be dissolved
in tetrahydrofuran, a good solvent for polyurethanes, indicating that
D3O and PORON XRD are relatively highly cross-linked materials. The
volume expansion ratios for D3O and PORON XRD are approximately 11
and 9, respectively. The dissolved mass portions for D3O and PORON
XRD in tetrahydrofuran are 2.1 and 4.2 wt %, respectively. The dissolved
mass portion for DEFLEXION in n-hexane is 77.3 wt
%, which is so much high that DEFLEXION cannot keep intact in the
solvent. The above result indicates that the cross-linking degree
for DEFLEXION is much lower than those for D3O and PORON XRD.

2.2 Surface and Internal Cell Structures from
SEM Observation
The mechanical property of impact–protective
materials depends strongly on the internal cell structures of these
foam materials, such as cell type, cell fraction, cell size, cell
size distribution, and so forth. Hence, the surface and internal cell
structures of D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION were examined using SEM,
and the results are shown in Figure 2. The internal cell parameters are summarized in Table 1 for clarity of comparison.
The surface of D3O shows discrete open pores. The internal cell structure
of D3O looks much different from that on the surface. The SEM micrograph
of the internal cell structure of D3O shows a continuous cellular
structure with compact cells. Certain cells have multiple micropores
on cell walls to allow a tunnellike connection between adjacent cells.
The number fraction of the cells with micropores, fm, is approximately 27.5%. PORON XRD exhibits very similar
cell structural patterns for both the surface and the internal structure.
Similar to D3O, a continuous cellular structure with compact cells
exists for PORON XRD. The difference between D3O and PORON XRD is
that most of the cells in PORON XRD have multiple micropores on cell
walls to allow a tunnellike connection between adjacent cells, and
eventually, the number fraction of the cells with micropores, fm, reaches approximately 94.7%. The surface
and internal cell structures of DEFLEXION look much different from
those of D3O and PORON XRD. The surface of DEFLEXION looks rough with
no pores, and the internal cell structure of DEFLEXION consists of
loosely dispersed cells in the polymer matrix. The cell walls of the
dispersed cells of DEFLEXION look smooth with no micropores (fm = 0).

Figure 2 SEM micrographs taken on the surface (A, left
panel) and internal
section (B, right panel) for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION. The scale
bar in the left bottom micrograph represents 200 μm and is applied
to other micrographs as well.

D3O	27.5	62	77	0.37	0.41	
PORON XRD	94.7	60	56	0.44	0.33	
DEFLEXION	0	48	78	0.41	0.44	
a Note that fm means the number fraction of cells with micropores,
β
is the cell volume fraction, D is the mean cell size,
αu is the ratio of the standard deviation of the
cell sizes to the mean cell size, and ρ is the apparent density.

To obtain the cell volume fraction,
cell sizes (diameters), and
size distributions for the internal cell structures of these three
samples, the SEM micrographs in the right panel of Figure 2 were analyzed in detail using
ImageJ software. The parameter β in eq 1 is used to evaluate the cell volume fraction
in the above samples 1  where Ap is the
integrated area occupied by all cells and At is the total area of the sample. The β values are 62, 60,
and 48% for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION, respectively, indicating
that DEFLEXION has a much less cell fraction than D3O and PORON XRD,
whereas D3O and PORON XRD have close cell fractions. Figure 3 shows the cell size distributions
fitted using the Lorentzian functions. The cells fall in the size
ranges of 24–187, 15–122, and 23–172 μm
for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION, respectively. The mean cell sizes D for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION are 77, 56, and 78 μm,
respectively, as listed in Table 1. To elucidate the uniformity of the cell size distribution
in the above samples, the ratio of the standard deviation of the cell
sizes to the mean cell size αu is defined in eq 2 as follows 2  where Di is the size
of each cell and n is the cell
number. Table 1 lists
the αu values of 0.37, 0.44, and 0.41 for D3O, PORON
XRD, and DEFLEXION, respectively. This result indicates that D3O has
a relatively more uniform cell size distribution than the other two
samples.

(b) PORON XRD, and (c) DEFLEXION.

The closed cells and cells with micropores for a tunnellike
connection
may play different important roles on the applicable mechanical properties
of the impact-protective materials. In particular, for the foams with
cells containing micropores (PORON XRD), the fluid flow through the
interconnections affects the stress response due to fluid viscosity.
In fact, the fluid inside of the cells, generally the air, can be
compressed during deformation and be expelled out of the cells or
absorbed back into the cells, which dissipates energy by a viscous
flow. On the other hand, for the foams with closed cells (DEFLEXION),
the fluid (air) contribution is dependent on the strain because a
volume reduction of closed cells increases the internal pressure.
Meanwhile, the fluid (air) contribution can be neglected if the foam
stiffness is sufficiently high.19

2.3 Rheological Properties of Impact-Protective
Materials
The rheological properties of these impact-protective
materials were studied. Figure 4 shows the changes in the storage modulus G′ and the loss modulus G″ versus angular
frequency ω for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION as measured at
25 °C with different axial forces. Evidently, the axial force
shows a significant influence on the moduli, with both G′ and G″ increasing with increasing
axial force over the entire experimental frequency range for all of
these three samples. The effect of the axial force on the modulus
increase is thought to result from the compression of the samples
because of their foam structures. The compression study on the samples
will be presented in the next section. As can be seen from Figure 4a, D3O shows a typical
elastic behavior at low frequencies, where G′
> G″ is obviously seen,20−22 and a viscous
behavior at intermediate frequencies, where G′
< G″ is seen. The G′
and G″ curves show a cross-over frequency
at 7.53 rad/s, at which D3O experiences a transition from an elastic
state to a viscous state. It can be further predicted from Figure 4a that for D3O, G′ becomes higher than G″
at even higher frequencies above 200 rad/s, indicating that D3O might
enter into another elastic state at much higher frequencies (out of
the measurement limitation). As apparently shown in Figure 4b, PORON XRD exhibits a rheological
behavior similar to that of D3O. However, the G′
and G″ curves for PORON XRD do not have a
cross-over at any intermediate frequencies because G′ values are always higher than G″
values over the entire frequency range; nevertheless, eventually a
cross-over of the G′ and G″ curves at the high-frequency end is predicted. As can be
seen from Figure 4c,
DEFLEXION displays a rheological behavior obviously different from
D3O and PORON XRD. For DEFLEXION, the G′ values
are much higher than G″ values in the entire
frequency range; therefore, there is no cross-over between the G′ and G″ curves, indicating
a solidlike viscoelastic behavior.14,23 On the other
hand, the dynamic moduli at low and intermediate frequencies are much
higher for DEFLEXION than for D3O and PORON XRD, possibly because
DEFLEXION is a silicone rubber-based material.

Figure 4 Changes in the storage
modulus G′ and loss
modulus G″ vs angular frequency ω for
(a) D3O, (b) PORON XRD, and (c) DEFLEXION as measured at 25 °C
with different axial forces.

The working mechanism for impact-protective materials is
to disperse
the concentrated impact and transform the energy from the impact to
other forms as much as possible. It is well-known that the loss modulus G″ is a measure of energy loss, which describes that
energy is transformed to heat when the material is deformed.24 For D3O and PORON XRD, the polyurethane-based
foams, the G′ values are close to the G″ values at high frequencies, indicating that these
two foams simultaneously exhibit high strength and great energy loss
in a high-frequency impact. This type of property is suited for soft,
close-fitting materials. However, for DEFLEXION, the silicone rubber-based
foam, the change of G′ with frequency is modest;
whereas the change of G″ with frequency is
much more significant at high frequencies, indicating that DEFLEXION
can dissipate much energy whether it suffers a large strain rate or
not. This type of property is suited for high-risk impact-protective
materials.

Xu et al. have taken the ratio of the maximum moduli
at a high
frequency to the minimum moduli at a low frequency to evaluate the
softness–stiffness switch characteristic of impact-protective
materials.14 Referring to this definition, Figure 5 shows the changes
in the normalized storage modulus G′ and loss
modulus G″ by respective moduli at 0.1 rad/s
with angular frequency ω for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION.
It can be observed that in general, the normalized G″ increases much faster than the normalized G′ in the experimental frequency range for all three samples.
In particular, the normalized G′ increases
more rapidly in the high frequency range for D3O than for PORON XRD
and DEFLEXION, indicating that D3O has a better softness–stiffness
switch characteristic and can be applied as an excellent impact-hardening
material. Figure 5b
shows that PORON XRD has a rheological behavior relatively similar
to that of D3O, but the normalized G′ increases
modestly with frequency for PORON XRD as compared with D3O. Figure 5c shows that for
DEFLEXION, the change in normalized G′ with
frequency is modest as compared with D3O and PORON XRD; however, for
DEFLEXION, normalized G″ increases much rapidly
as compared with G′ in the high-frequency
region, which infers a relatively weak softness–stiffness switch
characteristic. Therefore, DEFLEXION can be applied as an impact-protective
material under both low and high strain rates.

Figure 5 Changes in the normalized
storage modulus G′
and loss modulus G″ by the moduli at 0.1 rad/s
vs angular frequency ω for (a) D3O, (b) PORON XRD, and (c) DEFLEXION
as measured at 25 °C with different axial forces.

It is well-known that the loss tangent tan δ
is sensitive
to the structural change of the materials.25 Energy dissipation depends on tan δ (at the frequency of impact).26Figure 6 shows the changes of tan δ versus angular frequency
ω with different axial forces for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION.
It can be found that the tan δ−ω curves do not
depend on the axial force values for all three samples. For D3O, tan
δ increases with increasing frequency, reaches a maximum value,
and then slightly decreases with further increasing frequency. For
PORON XRD, tan δ keeps increasing with increasing frequency
and seems to reach a plateau value in the experimental frequency range.
For DEFLEXION, tan δ remains almost constant at low frequencies
and then keeps increasing with increasing frequency. Among the three
impact-protective materials, D3O shows the highest tan δ values
(higher than 1) at frequencies above 10 rad/s, implying that D3O can
dissipate most of the energy at high frequencies. PORON XRD shows
tan δ values close to 1 at high frequencies, implying that PORON
XRD can dissipate most of the energy at high frequencies as well but
with a relatively less degree as compared with D3O. DEFLEXION shows
much low tan δ values that hardly increase at low frequencies
and then start to increase with a limitation at high frequencies.
On the basis of the above rheological results, it is concluded that
D3O and PORON XRD exhibit remarkable softness–stiffness switch
characteristic under an excitation of the strain rate. The rheological
characterization can be considered to be a valuable methodology for
evaluating the performance of impact-protective materials.

axial forces.

2.4 Mechanical
Property of Impact-Protective Materials
The mechanical property
regarding the response to compression was
measured at a fixed strain amplitude of 75%. Various compression rates
were applied for the measurements. Figure 7 shows the stress–strain curves for
D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION during compressive tests with various
compression rates. It can be seen from Figure 7a and the inset that the stress–strain
curves exhibit three distinct regions: an initial linear elasticity
region (illustrated by the first dash-dot orange line in the inset
of Figure 7a), a second
linear stress-increasing region (illustrated by the second dash-dot
orange line in the inset of Figure 7a), and a densification region, as reported also for
other polymer foaming materials.1,27 Beginning with low
strains, usually up to 5% (see the inset in each plot in Figure 7), the compressive
mechanical performance exhibits linear elasticity, for which the cell
framework in the microstructure bends elastically.28 Compressing with further increasing strain (up to 25–50%),
the cells in the foam materials might collapse through elastic buckling,
plastic yielding, or brittle crushing, depending on the mechanical
properties of the cell walls. The collapse process undergoes a linearly
increasing stress with a reduced slope as compared with that in the
initial linear elasticity region. Finally, at high strains above 25–50%,
a densification region can be seen, for which the bulk frameworks
of the foam materials are compressed, and the porosities are predicted
to decrease significantly.1,27 The densification region
shows a strain-hardening behavior. When the strains are low, the energy
dissipation is more obvious for DEFLEXION than for the other two samples
because of the lower cell fraction and the lower cross-linking degree
for DEFLEXION than for the other two samples. Note that the cell volume
fraction values β for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION are 62,
60, and 48%, respectively. This result infers that D3O and PORON XRD
stay soft at low strains, whereas DEFLEXION stays relatively stiff
at low strains.

Figure 7 Stress–strain curves for (a) D3O, (b) PORON XRD,
and (c)
DEFLEXION in compressive tests with different compression rates. The
inset in each plot shows the stress–strain curves in the low
stress range. The numbers corresponding to the color lines in (a)
represent the compression rates in the unit of mm/min.

Apparently the stress–strain curves for
D3O, PORON XRD,
and DEFLEXION are obviously different at different compression rates,
implying their different sensitivities to the compression rate, consistent
with those for other polymer foaming materials.29,30 The dependences of compressive mechanical parameters on the compression
rate are further analyzed, and the results are presented below. The
Young’s modulus for compression, Elin, is defined as the elastic modulus in the initial elasticity region.
The Young’s modulus in the vicinity of the strain of 75% (before
75%) is defined as Emax, which can be
used to indicate the strain-hardening modulus. For comparison purposes,
the compression rates are transformed into the strain rates. Figure 8 shows the changes
in Elin, Emax, and Emax/Elin with the strain rate for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION. It can be
seen from Figure 8a
that DEFLEXION has the highest Elin values,
PORON XRD has the lowest Elin values,
and D3O has intermediate Elin values at
different strain rates. The Elin values
for PORON XRD and D3O are relatively close. The relatively lower Elin values for PORON XRD and D3O indicate that
these two polyurethane-based foam materials are relatively soft. On
the other hand, it can be seen from Figure 8b that DEFLEXION has the highest Emax values, PORON XRD has the lowest Emax values, and D3O has intermediate Emax values at low strain rates; however, the Emax values for PORON XRD increase with an increasing
strain rate and eventually become significantly higher than those
for D3O and DEFLEXION at the highest two strain rates as applied in
the study, possibly associated with the added SiO2 fillers
in PORON XRD. The Emax/Elin values can be used to evaluate the degree of strain-hardening.31,32Figure 8c shows that
PORON XRD has the largest degrees of strain-hardening at high strain
rates, and both PORON XRD and D3O have larger degrees of strain-hardening
than DEFLEXION. Overall, it can be concluded that the strain rate
shows obvious effects on the degree of strain-hardening for D3O and
PORON XRD, and PORON XRD possesses the highest degree of strain-hardening
when subjected to the highest strain rate as applied in this study.

of the strain of 75%, Emax, and (c) ratio
of Emax to Elin, Emax/Elin, with the strain rate for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION.

For impact-protective materials, energy dissipation Uhys and hysteresis uhys are
important parameters in practical applications, which can be calculated
from the cyclic compression curves.33,34 The Uhys and uhys values
can be calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 as follows 3   4  where Aloading and Aunloading are
the areas under the
compressive loading and unloading stress–strain curves, respectively.
Hysteresis uhys is considered to be the
percentage of energy dissipated. Figure 9 displays the changes in Uhys and uhys, with the strain
rate for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION. The absolute Uhys values for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION, shown in Figure 9a, are approximately
proportional to the G″ value shown in Figure 4, indicating that
both parameters are well-correlated with the energy dissipation. The Uhys values for DEFLEXION are much higher than
those for D3O and PORON XRD, possibly because of its much lower cross-linking
degree. The uhys values for DEFLEXION
range from 60 to 75% in the applied strain rate range, whereas the uhys values for D3O and PORON XRD increase from
26 to 80% as the strain rate increases. Both Uhys and uhys increase with increasing
strain rate for the three samples. In particular, the hysteresis becomes
much more sensitive to a high strain rate for D3O and PORON XRD than
for DEFLEXION, indicating that D3O and PORON XRD can absorb much energy
and turn stiff in a short time when suffering a high-speed impact
in a real application, and whether this behavior is related to their
specific structures containing cells with multiple micropores on cell
walls or not is worthy of further investigation. Considering the comfort
needs of the human body, D3O and PORON XRD with low Young’s
moduli for compression under a low strain rate are suited for use
as sports-protective materials. On the contrary, DEFLEXION has better use as armor
fillers suitable for suffering huge stress under a high strain rate,
for example, when hit by an ox horn or shot with a bullet.

Figure 9 Changes in
the (a) hysteresis energy Uhys and (b)
hysteresis uhys with the strain
rate for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION.

Elastic recovery (ER) values can be obtained according to eq 5 as follows20 5  where
εmax is the maximum
strain and ε(0, εmax) is the residual strain
at stress = 0 during recovery after experiencing the maximum strain
εmax. Figure 10 shows the changes in the ER with the strain rate for
the three impact-protective materials, which compares the ER abilities
after experiencing a large compression deformation.35,36 The ER values for DEFLEXION are the lowest and remain approximately
constant within the measured strain rate range, possibly because of
its lowest cell fraction value in the silicone rubber matrix and its
lowest cross-linking degree for the matrix itself. D3O shows sufficient
ER values at low strain rates, whereas its ER values become poor at
high strain rates. PORON XRD has the best ER values on the whole,
with an ER of approximately 100% at low strain rates and an ER of
>90% at high strain rates. In some situations where a significant
reversal of loading occurs, an independence of ER on the strain rate
is preferred, and for such a case, PORON XRD can be a good choice.

Figure 10 Changes
in the ER with the strain rate for D3O, PORON XRD, and
DEFLEXION.

From the rheological
behaviors shown in Figures 4–6, it is observed
that D3O and PORON XRD show the obvious frequency dependences for
various rheological parameters, whereas DEFLEXION shows the weak frequency
dependences for rheological parameters. From the mechanical properties
shown in Figures 7–10, it is also apparently observed that D3O and PORON
XRD exhibit apparent strain rate sensitivities for the mechanical
property parameters, whereas DEFLEXION shows a much weak strain rate
sensitivity in the measured strain rate. All of the above results
demonstrate that the measurements from rheometry and compression tests

3 Conclusions
In this work, three foam materials, D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION,
were chosen as typical representative impact-protective materials
to explore the relationship between the internal cellular structures
with the polymer matrix characteristics and rheological and compression
mechanical properties. It is found that the internal cellular structures
of polymer foam materials show significant influences on the rheological
and compression mechanical properties of impact-protective materials.
D3O and PORON XRD, the polyurethane-based foams with relatively high
cross-linking degrees, have close cell fractions, whereas DEFLEXION,
the silicone rubber-based foam with a much low cross-linking degree,
has a much less cell fraction than D3O and PORON XRD. Therefore, D3O
and PORON XRD display obviously different rheological behaviors from
DEFLEXION. D3O and PORON XRD exhibit remarkable softness–stiffness
switch characteristic under an excitation of the strain rate; however,
DEFLEXION exhibits a relatively weak softness–stiffness switch
characteristic. In particular, D3O and PORON XRD have hysteresis values
that are much more sensitive to the high strain rates than DEFLEXION,
indicating that D3O and PORON XRD can absorb much energy and turn
stiff in a short time when suffering a high-speed impact in a real
application, whereas DEFLEXION can serve as armor fillers suitable
for a huge stress under a low strain rate, for example, when hit by
an ox horn or shot with a bullet. Combining the rheological property
and the compression mechanical property, the relationship between
the internal cellular structures associated with the polymer matrix
characteristics and the mechanical performances of the impact-protective
materials can be understood. The rheological characterization proves
to be a valuable methodology for evaluating the performance of impact-protective
materials. The results of this study can provide some detailed references
on further research work on the human body-protective materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Three
impact-protective
materials were used for this study. D3O (D3O, UK) was obtained from
a SixSixOne knee pad (USA). PORON XRD (Rogers, USA) was obtained from
a G-Form knee pad (USA). DEFLEXION (Dow Corning, USA) was obtained
from a Rodeo Tech Bullfighting Vest (Rodeo Tech, USA). The apparent
densities ρ for D3O, PORON XRD, and DEFLEXION used in this work
were 0.41, 0.33, and 0.44 g/cm3, respectively.

4.2 Test of Solubility
According to FTIR
results and the solubility parameters, tetrahydrofuran was chosen
to dissolve D3O and PORON XRD, and hot n-hexane was
chosen to dissolve DEFLEXION. The dissolved masses from these samples
were weighed.

4.3 FTIR Measurements
FTIR spectra in
the wavenumber range of 4000–500 cm–1 for
the three samples were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 spectrometer
using the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode.

4.4 Thermal Property Measurements
Q5000
IR and Discovery thermogravimetric analyzers (TA Instruments, USA)
were used for the TGA of the samples in the temperature range of 100–800
°C under nitrogen and air atmosphere, respectively.

4.5 Surface and Internal Cell Structures and Chemical
Elements by SEM Observation
The surface and internal cell
structures of these three samples were examined by using a Philips
XL-30 field emission scanning electron microscope at an accelerating
voltage of 10.0 or 20.0 kV. For the internal cell structural observation,
the samples were cut with a blade, and the cross-section surfaces
were examined using SEM. EDS associated with SEM was used to determine
the chemical compositions of the samples.

4.6 Rheological
Property Measurement
Rheological measurements were performed
using an ARES G2 rheometer
(TA Instruments, USA). Disklike specimens were cut from the original
impact-protective materials. For D3O and PORON XRD, the diameter and
thickness of the specimens were 25 and 2 mm, respectively. For DEFLEXION,
the diameter and thickness of specimens were 8 and 2 mm, respectively.
Once the specimens were loaded into the rheometer, fixed axial forces
of 1–5 N were applied to prevent the sample from slipping. Strain sweep measurements
were carried out to determine the linear viscoelastic regime. Dynamic
oscillatory frequency sweeps from 0.1 to 200 rad/s were performed
with appropriate strains in the linear viscoelastic regime.

4.7 Compression and Recovery Test
The
tests were performed at quasi-static strain rates using an Instron
universal tensile testing machine, model 5982. Disklike specimens
were cut from the original impact-protective materials. The diameter
and thickness of the specimens were 11–13 and 6–8 mm,
respectively. Force–displacement data were converted to stress–strain
data using the sample dimensions. Energy losses at a constant strain
amplitude of 75% at different compression rates of 0.6, 2, 6, 60,
and 120 mm/min were obtained.
