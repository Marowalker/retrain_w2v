We
study the effects of using an emitting material (Pt(II) bis(3-(trifluoromethyl)-5-(2-pyridyl)pyrazolate—Pt(fppz)2) characterized by a preferred horizontal dipole alignment
and a nearly unitary quantum yield regardless of concentration on
the lifetime of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). Using such
a material as a dopant in increasingly higher concentrations is found
to lead to an increase in device stability, a trend that is different
from that commonly observed with conventional OLED guests. The results
are consistent with the newly discovered exciton–polaron-induced
aggregation degradation mechanism of OLED materials. When this emitter
is used as a neat emission layer, the material is already in a highly
aggregated state, and the device is no longer affected by exciton–polaron
interactions. The results demonstrate the potential stability benefits
of using such materials in OLEDs.

1 Introduction
Organic
light-emitting devices (OLEDs) have undergone rapid development
since their invention almost 3 decades ago.1 Owing to their advantages such as self-emission, large color gamut,
excellent contrast, and large viewing angle, displays utilizing the
efficient phosphorescent OLEDs, or PHOLEDs,2,3 currently
account for the second largest shipment in the mobile display industry,
after liquid crystal displays.4 However,
the limited stability of PHOLEDs, especially the blue-emitting OLEDs,
continues to be a challenge that prevents their wider adoption in
consumer electronics.

A common reason behind the lower stability
of blue PHOLEDs has
been identified as the fast bond cleavage of the host materials used
in these devices.5,6 In comparison to those used in
their green or red counterparts, host materials used in blue devices
generally have a wider band gap, making the energy of excitons formed
on them necessarily higher and hence increase the probability of bond
cleavage. In addition to chemical deterioration of the host materials,
we have recently discovered a new degradation mechanism7 that appears to play a major role in the limited
stability of PHOLEDs. When a device is under electrical bias, the
interaction of positive polarons and excitons causes the host material
to aggregate.7−9 This aggregation results in a decrease in the emission
quantum yield of the material. Moreover, this aggregation leads to
phase segregation between the host and the guest, causing a decrease
in energy transfer efficiency from the host to the guest and thus
a gradual loss in device efficiency over time.10 The aggregation rate of the host, hence also device lifetime,
is found to correlate with the band gap of the host, where hosts with
wider band gaps generally degrade faster. It has also been shown in
our previous work that this degradation mechanism can be suppressed
by reducing the density of excitons11 and/or
positive polarons12 within the emission
layer (EML). Developing materials that are immune to this aggregation
mechanism would ultimately be a more effective approach. In this regard,
it becomes interesting to see whether the use of emitter materials
that are already aggregated may provide any advantage. In this work,
we study the effects of using one such material, Pt(II) bis(3-(trifluoromethyl)-5-(2-pyridyl)pyrazolate)
(Pt(fppz)2),13 on device lifetime.

Pt(fppz)2 is a platinum-based phosphorescent orange/red
emitter. The molecular structure is shown in Figure 1. Unlike most phosphorescent materials, Pt(fppz)2 does not exhibit concentration quenching, and its nearly
unitary emission quantum yield is preserved even when used in a neat
film.14 This feature allows Pt(fppz)2 to be used as a neat EML in OLED. In 2014, Wang et al. demonstrated
that an OLED with such an EML can exhibit an external quantum efficiency
(EQE) as high as 31%.14 The underlying
reason for such a high efficiency is attributed to a 93% preferred
horizontal dipole ratio of Pt(fppz)2 when used in a neat
film.15 Because of such high order in molecular
packing, it has been shown that evaporated neat Pt(fppz)2 films form almost perfect single crystals based on glazing-incident
wide-angle X-ray diffraction experiments.15 Given this high level of crystallinity, it becomes interesting to
see whether the material may be immune to further aggregation by exciton–polaron
interactions. In this case, an OLED utilizing a neat Pt(fppz)2 EML may demonstrate longer lifetime than devices with Pt(fppz)2 used as a dopant.

2 Results and Discussion
To study the effects of using Pt(fppz)2 as a dopant
versus as the sole material in a neat EML on device lifetime, we fabricate
devices with the following architecture: indium tin oxide (ITO)/MoO3 (5 nm)/4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP) (48 nm)/CBP:Pt(fppz)2 (x%) (30 nm)/2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (80 nm), where x = 5, 20, 60, and 100 (shown in Figure 2a). Figure 2b presents the current efficiency versus luminance
characteristics of these devices. It should be noted that the device
with a neat Pt(fppz)2 EML is less efficient than the 60%
doped one. Because the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of the
60% doped film and the neat film are both around 95%,14 the lower efficiency of the device with a neat Pt(fppz)2 EML is likely due to a lower carrier mobility of the EML
compared to that of the 60% doped EML, as can be seen in Figure S1a, and thus a less optimal charge balance
factor. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these devices is
presented in Figure S1b. We would like
to point out that our devices have slightly lower EQE values than
those of the previously reported ones.15 The lower efficiency is likely a result of a lower charge balance
factor due to the use of different transport layers. Nonetheless,
the use of CBP and TPBi in our devices significantly improves their
stability (the lifetime comparison between our devices and that reported
by Wang et al. is shown in Figure S2).
Because the main focus of this work is to investigate device stability,
the choice of using more electrically stable charge transport materials
such as CBP and TPBi is more appropriate. Figure 3 presents the changes in device electroluminescence
(EL) with time in these devices. The devices are subjected to a constant
current of 20 mA/cm2. The change in EL is presented in
the form of normalized luminance, that is, luminance/initial luminance.
As can be seen clearly, the device lifetime increases monotonically
as the concentration of Pt(fppz)2 increases. It is important
to point out that this phenomenon is very different from that of the
devices using doped iridium-based emitters, where the device lifetime
would peak at around 5% emitter concentration.16 In iridium-based devices, the main degradation mechanism
shifts from exciton–polaron-induced aggregation of the host
(at low emitter concentrations) to a degradation in the emission quantum
yield of the emitter (at high emitter concentrations). A trade-off
between these two phenomena, and hence maximum device stability, therefore
occurs at intermediate concentrations (∼5%).

in a neat EML.

Figure 3 Changes in EL intensity
with time for devices with 5, 20, 60, and
100% Pt(fppz)2, under 20 mA/cm2 current density.

To understand why the device lifetime
increases with emitter concentration
and to investigate the effect of using already aggregated emitters
(i.e., 100% Pt(fppz)2) on device EL stability, we study
device EL spectra and their evolution with time as the device ages. Figure 4a presents the normalized
EL spectra for the device with 5% Pt(fppz)2 at various
time intervals. The change in absolute EL is shown in the inset of Figure 4a. It can be seen
that the peak of the EL spectrum for the device with 5% Pt(fppz)2 shifts to longer wavelengths over time. The red shift suggests
that the intermolecular Pt···Pt distance is decreasing,
pointing to an increase in molecular aggregation.14 One can see that this device also has the lowest stability.
Similar results are also observed in devices with 20% Pt(fppz)2 and are shown in Figure 4b. Here again, a red shift in the EL spectra can be
observed. The magnitude of the red shift is however less than in the
case of with 5% Pt(fppz)2. Although the device stability
is generally limited, it is higher in comparison to the previous case.
In contrast, when the Pt(fppz)2 concentration is further
increased to 60 or 100%, as shown in Figure 4c,d, the normalized EL spectra of these devices
do not show any spectral shift during device degradation. The changes
in CIE coordinates of these devices before and after 16 h of electrical
driving are included in Table 1. Knowing that the intermolecular stacking interaction is
much higher in these devices, especially in the neat film where the
Pt(fppz)2 molecules are packed in a way similar to a single
crystal, one can attribute this effect to the fact that the material
is already well aggregated and therefore does not undergo any further
aggregation. As a result, it is expected that the EML would no longer
be susceptible to exciton–polaron-induced aggregation, which
may explain the higher stability of these devices. To better illustrate
the changes in molecular packing during device operation, shifts in
device EL peak over time for all four devices are presented in Figure 5.

Although the device with the neat EML layer is the
most stable
one, it should be noted that the lifetime of such a device (T50) is still only about 16 h. To examine whether
the stability of the hole transport material is the limiting factor,
we fabricate a device with the structure ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/Spiro-CBP
(48 nm)/Pt(fppz)2 (30 nm)/TPBi (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (80
nm) for comparison. Spiro-CBP is used here because it has been shown
to be more stable than CBP.8Figure 6 presents the relative changes
of device EL (Figure 6a) and driving voltage (Figure 6b) over time for these two devices. It can be seen
clearly that both devices have very similar EL degradation trends
despite the fact that the CBP device has a faster rise in driving
voltage. The almost identical stability trends despite the use of
different hole transport layers suggests that the stability of the
hole transport material is not the limiting factor for the operational
stability of our PHOLEDs.

Figure 6 Changes in (a) EL intensity and (b) driving
voltage for devices
using CBP and Spiro-CBP as the hole transport material.

Seeing that the stability of hole transport material
is not the
main bottleneck behind the limited stability of the PHOLEDs with the
neat Pt(fppz)2 EMLs, we investigate the stability of Pt(fppz)2 under excitation by measuring changes in its relative emission
quantum yield as a result of the electrical stress and under UV irradiation.
The same neat EML device structure—ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/CBP
(48 nm)/Pt(fppz)2 (30 nm)/TPBi (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (80
nm)—is used in this set of experiment. Figure 7 presents the relative photoluminescence
(PL) intensity from Pt(fppz)2 before and after the device
has been electrically driven @ 20 mA/cm2 for 12 h (I_12
h) and after the device has been illuminated under UV (@ ∼380
nm with a power density of 2.3 mW/cm2) for 26 h (UV_26
h). It is clear that, in both cases, the emission quantum yield decreases
after aging, suggesting that the material has limited stability under
excitons (i.e., limited photostability).

Figure 7 Relative PL intensity

the device has been aged under various conditions.

To examine the effect of varying the chemical structure
of the
emitter, devices with the architecture ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/CBP
(48 nm)/CBP:Pt-But or Pt-Me (x%) (30 nm)/TPBi (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (80 nm), where x = 5, 20, 60, and 100, are fabricated. (The structural drawings of
Pt-But and Pt-Me are illustrated in Figure 1.) The J–V characteristics as well as current efficiency
data are presented in Figure S3. The changes
in device EL over time, as well as shifts in EL peak for Pt-But and Pt-Me devices are presented in Figure 8 (the actual EL data
are shown in Figures S4 and S5). Similar
to the Pt(fppz)2 devices, it can be seen that both Pt-But and Pt-Me devices show no spectral shift when
the emitter concentration reaches 60%, suggesting that the devices
are no longer susceptible to further aggregation as a result of exciton–polaron
interactions. However, the device with Pt-But emitter shows the longest device lifetime and, hence, the greatest
stability among the three. Again, this possibility is verified by
measuring changes in the emission quantum yield of Pt-But and Pt-Me emitters by application of electrical
stress as well as under UV irradiation (shown in Figure 9). The results show that Pt-But has the highest photostability, suggesting
that the higher chemical stability of this molecule under excitation
might be the reason for its higher EL stability in devices. The results
demonstrate that better molecular design of these emitters may improve
their stability dramatically.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the EL stability performance
of Pt(fppz)2 as a model compound of an emitter that has
a preferred horizontal dipole alignment and a nearly unitary emission
quantum yield regardless of material concentration. Using such a material
as a dopant in increasingly higher concentrations is found to lead
to an increase in device stability, a trend that is different from
that commonly observed with conventional (disordered) OLED guest materials.
The results are consistent with the newly discovered exciton–polaron-induced
aggregation degradation mechanism of OLED materials. When this emitter
is used as a neat emissive layer, the material is already in a highly
aggregated state and thus the device is no longer affected by exciton–polaron
interactions. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of these
materials for achieving higher stability and more stable color coordinates.
Although the photostability of this class of Pt(II) emitters is found
to be relatively limited, the results show that altering the molecular
structure has the potential to effectively improve the exciton stability
of these materials.

4 Experimental Section
The organic materials used in this study are 4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl
(CBP), 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi), and Pt(fppz)2. CBP and
TPBi were obtained from Luminescence Technology Corp. and used as
received without further sublimation. Pt(fppz)2 was synthesized
in house. Prior to device fabrication, the ITO-coated glass substrates
were cleaned by sonication in acetone and 2-propanol for 5 min each,
in respective order. Devices with an active area of 2 × 2 mm2 were then fabricated in an EvoVac system from Angstrom Engineering
Inc. All materials were thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.1–2
Å/s at a base pressure of 5 × 10–6 Torr.
The devices were kept and measured in a nitrogen atmosphere at all
times.
