Foams are widely
used to remove liquid loading at the bottom of
gas wells to improve natural gas production. However, it becomes ineffective
when a gas well contains a large amount of hydrocarbon condensate
because oil will rupture the foams. In this work, condensate oil-tolerant
foams were developed and stabilized by a mixture of cocamidopropyl
hydroxyl sulfobetaine (CHSB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The
foam properties are examined at different temperatures under atmospheric
conditions and high pressures with various contents of condensate
oil. It is found that the foam stability is improved when the oil
content is increased; in addition, high temperature, high salinity,
and high pressure are beneficial for foam stabilizing. To reveal the
mechanism of stable foam in the presence of high content of oil, a
confocal microscope was employed to visualize oil–foam interactions.
It was observed that the high stability of the SDS–CHSB foams
is ascribed to the formation of stable pseudoemulsion between oil
droplets and the gas–liquid interface. Such condensate oil-tolerant
foams show promising potential to be used in the foam-assisted lift
process during natural gas production.

1 Introduction
Foams
are binary thermodynamic nonequilibrium systems comprising
surfactant-containing water and air which represents typically 90%
of the foam volume.1,2 Owing to their relatively small
particle size, large superficial area, and excellent fluidity,3 foams are not only extensively used in daily
detergency, such as cosmetics,4 firefighting,5 and detergents but also widely employed in many
industrial applications.6−8 For example, in oil and gas industry,
the foam-assisted lift (FAL) process is frequently used to improve
natural gas production.9 In this process,
a foaming agent is added into a gas well, which can quickly dissolve
in water and dramatically decrease surface tension. With the presence
of natural gas and foaming agent, generally a surfactant or a mixture
of different surfactants, foams will be continuously produced, and
water resided at the bottom of gas wells will be carried by foams
and lifted up to the ground surface. However, the hydrocarbon condensate
whose main composition is light oil always accompanies with natural
gas, which decreases the stability of foams and even destroys the
formed foam in the natural gas wells.10 Therefore, the FAL process fails in improving gas production in
this case, and it is highly desirable to develop oil-tolerant foams
for natural gas production.

Previous work11−14 well demonstrated the defoaming
mechanism of oil on aqueous foams,
and it is widely accepted that such a destabilization process can
be divided into three steps: entry of the oil droplet into the gas–liquid
interface,15,16 spreading of oil on the foam
film,17 and the formation of an unstable
bridge across lamella.18 To describe foam
stability in the presence of oil, the entering coefficient (E), spreading coefficient (S), and bridging
coefficient (B) were used as criteria for evaluating
the thermodynamic destabilization by oil16,19 1   2   3  where δwg and δog are the surface tension between surfactant
solution and
gas, and that between oil and gas, respectively; δwo is the interfacial tension between surfactant solution and oil.

The precondition for oil to destroy foam is that the oil droplet
must enter into the gas–liquid interface, which can be realized
when E > 0.15 Once
an
oil droplet penetrates into the gas–liquid interface, it can
spread on the surface of the foam film when S >
0.20 In this case, the gas–liquid
interface
is expected to expand, resulting in thinning of the film and eventually
leading to bursting of bubbles. On the contrary, when S < 0, the oil droplet cannot spread and in this situation, it
will form oil lens at the gas–liquid interface and finally
destroy the foam film if it makes its way into the lamella surface
where B > 0. This is so-called the “bridging
mechanism”.21 However, the abovementioned
equations can only describe whether oil entering and spreading occurs
or not, and they are unable to reflect the rate of entering and spreading.
It is possible that the entering coefficient is positive, but the
foams are rather stable owing to the slow rate of oil penetrating
into the interface. Koczo and co-workers22 illustrated that the rate of oil entering and spreading depends
on the stability of the pseudoemulsion film which is formed between
the air–solution surface and an approaching oil droplet. Therefore,
in order to generate stable foams in the presence of oil, the coefficients
should be negative which, according to the classical theory, indicates
that the entering and spreading of oil drops is thermodynamically
unfavorable or forms a stable pseudoemulsion film.

It was confirmed
that the presence of surfactants, proteins, and
polymers can enhance foam stability. The origin of the stability is
related to the slowing down of coarsening, drainage, or coalescence,
and eventually forming ultrastable foams.23,24 In addition, to obtain oil-tolerant foams, Koczo et al.10 recently developed six silicon polyether surfactants
and the trisiloxane superspread as foam agents in the FAL process
in the presence of high amounts of hydrocarbons. They noticed that
the surfactants with organic silicone groups formed a stable pseudoemulsion
film, exhibiting high liquid loading and good stability in the sparing
and foam beating tests. However, the oil used in their tests is not
condensate oil, and the test condition is far from real gas well environment
where both temperature and pressure are much higher than ambient temperature
and pressure. Vikingstad and Aarra11 found
that, accompanied with different types of alkenes, perfluoroalkyl
betaine formed stable foams similar to those without oil. Mannhardt
et al.25 indicated that the addition of
the fluorinated surfactant to various types of hydrocarbon surfactants
increased their foam tolerance to oil. Nevertheless, the cost of the
fluorinated surfactant is too expensive to be used in the FAL process.
Pu’s team26 found that polymer-assisted
surfactant foams displayed excellent oil resistance in the static
foam test; however, the presence of the polymer would lead to high
viscous solution, causing inconvenience during the FAL operation.

Alternatively, the surfactant mixture has been proven to be an
effective way to minimize defoaming risk in the presence of oil. For
example, catanionic surfactant mixtures composed of anionic and cationic
surfactants exhibited special bulk and interfacial properties owing
to electrostatic attraction.27,28 On one hand, catanionic
mixtures are highly close packed and form dense adsorption layers
which lead to a strong viscoelastic interface. On the other hand,
the formation of vesicles in the catanionic mixtures would reduce
bubble coalescence and gas transfer between bubbles. These properties
increase the stability of the foam in the presence of oil.29−31 However, phase transition occurred in such a catanionic surfactant
solution when the salinity increased,32 resulting in failure for deliquification in the gas wells with highly
saline water. On the contrary, surfactant mixtures consisting of zwitterionic
and anionic surfactants can overcome such drawbacks. Danov et al.33 demonstrated that a small amount of commercial
zwitterionic surfactant “TEGO Betaine F50” could significantly
increase the surface elasticity of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution,
which is beneficial for enhancing foam stability. Furthermore, the
stability of anionic–zwitterionic foams showed insensitivity
to salinity. Basheva et al.34 reported
that betaine which acted as a foaming agent in the presence of silicone
oil could increase the barrier for drop entering and suppress the
capacity of the silicone oil as an antifoamer.

Enlightened by
these findings, here, we developed condensate oil-tolerant
foams stabilized by a new binary cost-effective surfactant mixture
composed of the popularly used anionic surfactant SDS and a commodity
zwitterionic surfactant, cocamidopropyl hydroxyl sulfobetaine (CHSB).
Two-fold goals are aimed to be addressed in this work: gaining insight
into the foam behavior in the presence of oil under simulated gas
well environment and unraveling the oil-resistant mechanism by visualizing
the microstructure of the oil droplet in the surfactant solution.
To this end, the ratio of CHSB to SDS was firstly optimized by the
static foam test in the presence of oil. Then, the influence of temperature,
salinity, and pressure on SDS–CHSB foam performance was examined.
Furthermore, the stability of the pseudoemulsion film was quantitatively
described by monitoring the time taken for a single oil droplet to
coalesce at the solution–gas interface. In addition, confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was utilized to visualize foam–oil
interactions to further reveal the mechanism of oil tolerance.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Foam Performance in the
Presence of Oil
To get an optimal formulation, the performance
of SDS–CHSB
foams was examined in the presence of oil as a function of the ratio
of SDS to CHSB. Then, the effect of temperature, salinity, and pressure
on foam performance at the optimal ratio was studied.

2.1.1 Ratio of SDS to CHSB of Foam Performance
Although multicomponent
surfactant mixtures are widely used in
daily life and industrial processes, the optimal ratio of the surfactant
mixture that produces a synergistic effect in the foam performance
at some special conditions is generally unclear. In this subsection,
mixtures with different ratios of SDS to CHSB were prepared to produce
foams, and we attempted to find an optimal ratio by monitoring the
foam height at different ratios. The weight ratio of SDS to CHSB varies
from 1:0, 4:1, 3:2, 2:3, 1:4, to 0:1; that is, the content of CHSB
in the mixture is 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%, respectively.

The results of Hmax and t1/2 of foams produced from different formulations with
different oil contents were graphed in three dimensions (Figure 1). In all cases,
the surfactant concentration is fixed at 1.0 wt %, and the temperature
and salinity are set at 80 °C and 4 × 104 mg·L–1, respectively, to simulate the gas well environment.
Considering the condensate content in the targeted gas reservoir,
the maximum oil content was set as 50%. As depicted in Figure 1a,b, while those of single
CHSB solution are higher than those of SDS solutions, the Hmax and t1/2 of
both single surfactant solutions are lower than those of SDS–CHSB
mixtures. For SDS–CHSB mixtures, Hmax and t1/2 increases monotonously with
the rise of the CHSB content in the mixture at the same oil content.
For instance, when CHSB concentration is 0.2%, Hmax and t1/2 were 470 mm and 937
s, respectively. However, when the CHSB concentration increased to
0.4, 0.6, and 0.8%, Hmax and t1/2 significantly increased to 530 mm and 1295 s, 580
mm and 2537 s, 800 mm and 3480 s, respectively, at the oil content
of 50%.

Figure 1 Foam performance of different surfactant systems. (a) Hmax, which was used to describe the foamability. (b) t1/2, which was used to describe the foam stability.
The surfactant concentration is fixed at 1.0 wt % in all cases.

Surprisingly, both Hmax and t1/2 increase upon
increase of oil content for
SDS–CHSB solutions regardless of the CHSB content, much unlike
those of single surfactant solutions. For example, at the ratio of
4:1 for CHSB to SDS, when the oil content increased from 10 to 50%, Hmax and t1/2 significantly
increased from 480 mm and 1500 s to 800 mm and 3480 s and it was also
found that foam exhibited best oil resistance at the ratio of 4:1
for CHSB to SDS.

It can be explained from three aspects: firstly,
we attempted to
consider the energy (Es) needed to generate
foams 4  where γ refers to
surface tension and A stands for the area created.
If the external energy applied
to generate foam is constant and the lower the γ is, the better
the foamability will be. Exhibited in Figure 2 is the surface tension plotted versus surfactant
concentration for different formulations. One can find that the plots
for all surfactant solutions, either a single component or mixture,
can be divided into two parts: a slope and a plateau. The intersection
of them is critical micelle concentration (cmc). Immediately, one
can notice that cmc values (0.24% for SDS and 0.16% for CHSB) of both
single surfactant solutions are much higher than those of mixtures.
This can be ascribed to the adsorption of two surfactants, the total
adsorption, and the occupancy of the Stern layer by bound counterions.29 In addition, when increasing the CHSB content
in the mixture, the cmc of mixed surfactants decreased gradually.
For example, at 0.2% CHSB, the cmc is 0.14%; when CHSB content increases
to 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8%, the cmc increased and passed through 0.13 and
0.11 to 0.09% finally. Another key parameter for surface activity
is equilibrium surface tension, γcmc, that is, the
surface tension at cmc. It is worth noting that whatever the ratios
are, γcmc of all SDS–CHSB solutions is centered
around 28.50 mN·m–1, which is much lower than
those of single SDS and CHSB solutions (32.67 and 35.22 mN·m–1, respectively). The surfactant concentration is fixed
at 1.0% during the test of foamability, which is much higher than
the cmc. Accordingly, the surface tension of SDS–CHSB solutions
is lower than those of corresponding single solutions, which can explain
better foam performance of SDS–CHSB solutions. Secondly, it
was confirmed that the foam stability is controlled by the stability
of the pseudoemulsion film. The pseudoemulsion film of CHSB–SDS
foam was much stable than that of single CHSB and SDS foam (Section 2.2.3). Finally,
the Hmax and t1/2 of mixed surfactants increased with the increase of the oil content,
and this is attributed to the evaporation of condensate oil (Section 2.1.2).

Figure 2 Surface tension
plotted as a function of the concentration for
the mixed surfactant solutions with different contents of CHSB (T = 25 °C).

2.1.2 Effect of Temperature
The temperature
in the gas reservoir may vary both in areal and vertical extents,
and foams are a thermodynamic instable system, sensitive to temperature
fluctuation. As mentioned above, when the CHSB content reaches 80%
in the mixture, the Hmax and t1/2 of corresponding foams top among others. Thus, the
effect of temperature on these two parameters of the foams with 0.8%
CHSB and 0.2% SDS was investigated.

As shown in Figure 3, in the absence of oil, Hmax was around 205 mm when the temperature increased;
however, t1/2 dramatically decreased from
1140 to 610 s. In the presence of oil, when the condensate loading
is fixed, Hmax increases significantly
with the temperature elevated. Based on the composition of the condensate
oil used in this work, as shown in Figure S1, one can find nearly 10% alkanes bearing six or five atoms whose
boiling point is under 70 °C.35 At
the temperature of 60 and 65 °C, Hmax is around 200 mm, and it almost maintains a constant value with
the change of oil content. In addition, the t1/2 of foam decreased with the increase of the oil content.
When the oil content fixed, t1/2 decreased
when the temperature increased. This is due to the fact that more
gas would overcome the energy barrier and then enter the foam film
that would increase the coarsening speed with increasing temperature.36 In addition, the increase of drainage speed
and coalescence speed leads to the decrease of foam stability. At
temperatures of 70, 75, and 80 °C, with the elevation of temperature,
condensate oil evaporates in the open glass tube during the Ross–Miles
process. As a result, the condensate oil acted as foaming gas which
continuously offers energy at the bottom of the glass tube.37 Ultimately, foams in the glass cylinder would
be promoted by the moving steam, which would make the maximum foam
height raised. Therefore, Hmax and t1/2 significantly increased with the increase
of oil content owing to the evaporation of condensate oil.

Figure 3 (a) Hmax and (b) t1/2 of foams (0.2%SDS + 0.8%CHSB) in the presence of different
oil concentrations at different temperatures. The surfactant concentration
and salinity are fixed at 1.0% and 4 × 104 mg·L–1, respectively.

2.1.3 Effect of Salinity
Typically, salinity
has a great effect on foamability and foam stability. It has been
reported that the foamability and foam stability deteriorate when
the salinity is increased.38 Thus, the
effect of salinity on foam performance was investigated to identify
whether the foam agent can satisfy the performance requirement under
high salinity.

As depicted in Figure 4, in the absence of oil, Hmax was nearly unchanged when the salinity increased.
Nevertheless, t1/2 was slightly increased.
In the presence of oil, when the oil content was fixed, the value
of Hmax slightly decreases when the salinity
increases. For instance, Hmax drops from
800 to 740 mm at 50% oil content when the salinity increases from
4 × 104 to 12 × 104 mg·L–1. This is due to the fact that the cations in the
synthetic brine would shield the electrostatic repulsion of the anionic
surfactant SDS, which will decrease the surface activity of the mixed
surfactant solution.38 However, t1/2 was dramatically increased upon increasing
salinity, for instance, when the salinity increased from 4 ×
104 to 8 × 104 and 12 × 104 mg·L–1, t1/2 increased
from 3480 to 3920 and 4030 s.

Figure 4 Influence of salinity on (a) Hmax and
(b) t1/2 of foams containing 0.2% SDS
and 0.8% CHSB at different oil contents. The surfactant concentration
and test temperature are 1.0% and 80 °C, respectively.

To uncover how salinity influences
the stabilization of foams,
CLSM was used to visualize the microstructures of the foams stabilized
by 0.2% SDS and 0.8% CHSB foam at different salinities. As shown in Figure 5, the dark field
represents the gas in the film, while the green field highlights the
liquid film in the foams generated 3 min later. The general trend
shows that the higher the salinity, the thicker the film is. For example,
at salinity 4 × 104 mg·L–1,
the average thickness of the foam film was only 56.50 μm (Figure 5a). When the salinity
increased, the corresponding film thickness went up to 75.41 and 86.49
μm (Figure 5b,c),
because the excess salt ionic tends to combine with water molecules
and form ion-bound water to gather around the foam film.39,40 In addition, we used CLSM to observe the foam morphology at different
salinities with a larger field (Figure S2). At the same time, we measured the bubble size of the foam at different
salinities (Figure S3). The bubble sizes
are different, and the mean bubble size decreased when the salinity
increased.

Figure 5 Micrographs of foams containing 0.2% SDS and 0.8% CHSB at different
salinities: (a) 4 × 104; (b) 8 × 104; and (c) 12 × 104 mg·L–1.
The total surfactant concentration is 1.0%, and the test temperature
is fixed at 25 °C.

2.1.4 Effect of Pressure
The pressure
increases with the depth of the gas well; thus, it is essential to
study the impact of pressure on SDS–CHSB foams. Compared in Figure 6 are Hmax and t1/2 for foams stabilized
by 1.0% SDS, 1.0% CHSB, and the mixture of 0.2% SDS and 0.8% CHSB. Hmax was monotonously increased with the increase
in pressure, indicating that pressure is beneficial for foaming and
foam stabilization. However, the increased scope of mixed surfactant
foam is larger than the single SDS and CHSB foam. For example, when
the pressure increases from 2 to 8 MPa, the Hmax of SDS–CHSB foam dramatically increased from 4.0
to 8.0 cm; however, the single SDS and CHSB foam are slightly increased
from 3.5 and 2.8 to 4.2 and 4.1 cm, respectively. t1/2 shows a similar variation tendency upon increasing
of pressure. When the pressure increases from 2 to 8 MPa, the t1/2 of single SDS and CHSB foam, respectively,
increased from 31 and 22 to 78 and 69 min, showing a faint increase.
On the contrary, t1/2 experienced a remarkable
increase from 40 to 291 min. These results again suggest that SDS–CHSB
foams are more stable than their single SDS and CHSB counterparts.

Figure 6 Impact
of pressure on (a) Hmax and
(b) t1/2 of three foams stabilized by
1.0% CHSB, 1.0% SDS, and the mixed surfactant containing 0.2% SDS
and 0.8% CHSB. The temperature is fixed at 80 °C and condensate
oil is 10%.

In order to observe the
evolution of the foams, continuous microscopy
images of foam bubbles stabilized by the mixture of 0.2% SDS and 0.8%
CHSB were recorded over time after stopping gas flow in the high-temperature
and high-pressure foam meter. As depicted in Figure 7, taking the pressure of 2 MPa as an example,
as time went by, the thickness of the foam film showed a little change.
However, the size of the large bubbles increased gradually, while
the small ones disappeared. These results were attributed to the gas
transfer from the smaller to bigger bubbles or the rupture of the
thin film. In addition, within the same drainage time, the size of
bubbles decreased with increasing pressure because the gas diffusion
and coalescence was compressed at high pressure. For instance, at
the 3rd min, the bubble size of foams at 8 MPa is smaller than that
of 2 MPa; therefore, t1/2 was increased
with increasing pressure such as t1/2 was
stupendously increased from 40 to 291 min when the pressure increased
from 2 to 8 MPa. These phenomena indicate that pressure is favorable
for foaming and stabilization of SDS–CHSB foams.

the foam texture stabilized by the mixture of 0.2%
SDS and 0.8% CHSB under different pressures at 80 °C visualized
by high-pressure and high-temperature foam meter. The scale bar is
0.2 mm.

2.2 Mechanism
of Oil Tolerance
Although
the above experiments demonstrated that the mixture of SDS and CHSB
can stabilize foams and remarkably improved oil tolerance compared
to those stabilized by single CHSB or SDS solutions, the mechanism
why SDS–CHSB can tolerate oil is unclear yet. To uncover the
mechanism behind the experimental results, oil–foam interaction
was elucidated using classical entering and spreading theory and stability
of the pseudoemulsion film.

2.2.1 Surface Tension, Interfacial
Tension, and
Entering and Spreading Coefficients
In order to unravel the
oil-tolerant mechanism of the foams stabilized by the SDS–CHSB
mixture, the surface and interfacial tensions of 1.0% SDS, CHSB, and
0.2% SDS–0.8% CHSB were compared. The entering (S) and spreading coefficients (E) were calculated
according to eqs 1 and 2. As listed in Table 1, the δwg and δwo of SDS–CHSB mixture solution are, respectively, 28.58 and
0.50 mN·m–1, which are lower than those of
single SDS and CHSB aqueous solutions. In addition, the E and S values of the SDS–CHSB mixture are
18.85 and 19.85 mN·m–1, respectively, which
were the lowest among three systems.

(E) and Spreading (S) Coefficients

0.2% SDS–0.8% CHSB	28.58	9.23	0.50	18.85	19.85	
As mentioned earlier
in the “Introduction” part,
when E and S are
positive, the entering and spreading of oil droplets are thermodynamically
favorable. In fact, E represents the decrease in
the free energy that occurs when the oil droplet enters into the gas–liquid
film, and S denotes, quantitatively, the driving
force for the oil droplet to spread on the surface and is also inferred
from the decrease in free energy resulting from the oil droplet spreading
at the gas–liquid film. These coefficients of three systems
are all positive which, according to the classical theory, indicates
that the entering and spreading of the oil drop are thermodynamically
favorable. However, E and S coefficients
can only describe whether oil entering and spreading occur or not,
and they are unable to reflect the rate of entering and spreading.

2.2.2 Oil–Foam Interaction
As
reported by Koczo et al.,22 the stability
of foam in the presence of oil may be controlled by the stability
of the pseudoemulsion film. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the pseudoemulsion film of these three systems. To this end, CLSM
was used to observe the three-phase plateau of the foams, and rhodamine
B was used as a fluorescent probe to label the foam film.

Displayed
in Figure 8a–c
are the micrographs of the foams stabilized by 1.0% SDS and 1.0% CHSB,
and the mixture of 0.2% SDS and 0.8% CHSB, respectively. Compared
to the foams stabilized by SDS and CHSB, the bubble size of SDS–CHSB
foams is relatively small. Moreover, the condensate oil was emulsified
into small oil droplets which were accumulated in the Plateau borders
(PBs), as indicated by the arrow in Figure 8d–f. Nevertheless, the oil droplets
rapidly entered into the foam film and occupied the film in the single
SDS and CHSB solution, respectively (Figure 8d,e). Unlike the SDS- and CHSB-stabilized
foams (Figure 8a,b),
the oil droplets approach the foam film in the SDS–CHSB system,
and the oil droplets remained within the surfactant solution rather
than penetrating into the gas–liquid interface under the restricted
space of PBs (Figure 8f). This is ascribed to the assumption that the stable pseudoemulsion
film is formed between the oil droplets and gas–liquid film
in the mixed surfactant solution.

Figure 8 CLSM imaging of foams stabilized by (a)
1.0% SDS, (b) 1.0% CHSB,
and (c) 0.2% SDS and 0.8% CHSB, respectively. (d–f) are the
enlarged images corresponding to (a–c). The scale bar in (a–c)
is 200 μm, while it is 50 μm in (d–f).

After the foams are generated, the air inside would
transfer from
smaller to bigger bubbles owing to the pressure in smaller bubbles
is large than that in bigger ones. Therefore, the size of the large
bubbles increased while that of small bubbles gradually diminished.
It was confirmed that the rate of foam collapse owing to interbubble
gas diffusion is shown to be a sensitive function of the initial distribution
of the bubble size.41 The smaller the average
diameter and the narrower the bubble size distribution of foam, the
more stable it will be. As shown in Figure 9, it was found that SDS–CHSB had 83%
of bubbles with a diameter ranging from 0 to 200 μm, whereas
single SDS and CHSB only had 23 and 40% of bubbles within this size
range. Thus, it is clear that bubble size distribution of SDS–CHSB
foam was narrower than that of single SDS and CHSB foam, and the mean
diameter of SDS–CHSB foam was also smaller than single SDS
and CHSB foam in the presence of oil. Therefore, the oil resistance
of mixed surfactants is better than that of single SDS and CHSB.

bubble size distribution of three foam systems stabilized
by (a) 1.0% SDS, (b) 1.0% CHSB, and (c) 0.2% SDS–0.8% CHSB
mixture.

2.2.3 Stability
of Pseudoemulsion Film
The stability of the pseudoemulsion
film was evaluated by monitoring
the time taken for the single oil droplet to coalesce at the solution–air
interface using the experiment setup shown in Section 4.6. As summarized in Table 2, it was found that the coalescence time
of the single oil droplet in SDS–CHSB solution is dozens of
times longer than those in single SDS and CHSB solution, indicating
that the film formed between the solution–gas surface of the
SDS–CHSB system and the approaching oil drop is more stable
than those of single SDS and CHSB surfactant solution. This result
suggests that the foam lamella formed from mixed surfactant solution
contained condensate oil, which would be broken more slowly than those
stabilized by a single surfactant. Consequently, the foam would be
more stable for the SDS–CHSB system in the presence of oil.
In addition, the entering time increased with increase of surfactant
concentration, indicative of the gas production can be improved by
increasing the surfactant concentration during the FAL process. The
whole process is depicted in the movie available in the Supporting Information. In the movie, the surfactant
concentration of three systems is fixed at 1.0%. The oil droplet in
the single SDS and CHSB solution stayed under the gas–liquid
interface just for few seconds and then quickly ruptured. However,
the oil droplet in mixed surfactants remained stable for 147 s which
is much longer than that of single surfactants.

Based
on abovementioned analysis, a tentative mechanism is proposed
to account for the oil tolerance of SDS–CHSB foam (Figure 10). In the mixed
surfactant, the negative ions in SDS would interact with the positive
counterpart in CHSB because of the strong electrostatic attraction.
As a result, the surfactant molecules tend to arrange more closely
on the gas–solution interface. Correspondingly, a similar phenomenon
occurred at the oil–solution interface in the presence of oil.
These characters of anionic–sulfobetaine mixtures contribute
to an extremely stable pseudoemulsion film and thus enhancing the
entering barrier of oil droplets to the foam film. On the basis of
the discussion above, the possible schematic of pseudoemulsion film
stability of the anionic–sulfobetaine surfactant mixture is
concluded.

surfactant mixture.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we compared the stability of foams
stabilized by
a single anionic surfactant, SDS, a single zwitterionic surfactant,
CHSB, as well as the mixture of SDS and CHSB. The binary mixed surfactant
solutions show improved oil tolerance, in particular, unexpected increased Hmax and t1/2 values.
When the ratio of CHSB to SDS is 4:1, the binary mixed system showed
optimal foam performance in the presence of oil. The elevated stability
was ascribed by the much more stable pseudoemulsion film in the mixture
surfactant system. The negative ionic in SDS would combine with the
positive ionic in CHSB. Such a hypothesis was further verified by
direct imaging with CLSM. By means of investigating the effect of
temperature, salinity, and pressure on foam performance in the presence
of oil, it is found that the SDS–CHSB foam exhibited excellent
foam performance in extreme environments such as high temperature,
high salinity, and high pressure, indicating that SDS–CHSB
foams possess the potential to be utilized in the FAL operation.

Compared to previous oil-tolerant foams used in the FAL process,
those stabilized by the SDS–CHSB mixture in the current work
exhibit promising advantages including low cost, simplicity, and diversity;
that is, no additional fluorinate surfactants or organosilicon surfactants
are needed, no polymer is needed, and can be used in various harsh
environments. However, CHSB is ready to be absorbed onto the negative
surface of sandstones, which may result in a chromatographic fractionation
effect during the FAL process.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
SDS (93%), NaCl (AR), CaCl2 (AR),
and MgCl2 (AR) were purchased from Kelong
Chemical Reagent Factory Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). CHSB aqueous
solution with 35% active content was provided by Huayu Fine Chemicals
Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). Deionized water (conductivity, κ
= 7.9 μS·cm–1) triply distilled by a
quartz water purification system was used throughout this study. Condensate
oil was offered by the West Sichuan Gas Production Plant of Sinopec
Southwest Branch, and its hydrocarbon composition is shown in Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information. Oil red
A (99 wt %) was obtained from Mikxy Chemical Reagent Factory Co.,
Ltd. (Chengdu, China). Rhodamine B (99.8 wt %) was obtained from Aladdin
Reagent Factory Co., Ltd. (Shanghai. China).

4.2 Preparation
of Synthetic Brine
NaCl
(96.0 g), 21.0 g CaCl2, and 3.0 g MgCl2 were
added into a beaker with 500 mL deionized water followed by stirring
until the salts completely dissolved. Afterward, the solution was
transferred into a volumetric flask to get 1000 mL brine. In this
way, the 12 × 104 mg·L–1 synthetic
brine was obtained. Correspondingly, the 4 × 104 and
8 × 104 mg·L–1 synthetic brine
were obtained by diluting the 12 × 104 mg·L–1 synthetic brine in proportion.

4.3 Preparation and Characterization of the Foams
The foaming
properties of surfactant mixture solution were characterized
by foamability (the maximum foam height in specified time, Hmax) and foam stability (the time period of
foam reduces to half height, t1/2) measured
by the Ross–Miles procedure which is commonly used to estimate
foam properties under ambient pressure.31 The foams were generated by filling a pipette with 200 mL surfactant
solution, which was then allowed to fall a specified distance (90
cm) into 50 mL same surfactant solution that was contained in a receiver. Hmax and t1/2 were
recorded after 200 mL surfactant solution was flowed down. To minimize
the errors, the average values from three runs of measurements were
used for further analysis.

The foam performance under high pressure
and high temperature was evaluated by a homemade foam meter (Figure 11) which is composed
of an injection system, an observation window, an electromagnetic
agitator mounted at the bottom of the glass tube, a N2 container,
and a temperature and pressure control system (Figure 11).42 At fixed
temperature and pressure, the foam was generated by agitation of 100
mL surfactant solution at 1020 rpm for 3 min. Hmax and t1/2 were tracked by imaging
foam bubbles using a BX53 microscopy probe (Olympus, Japan) interfaced
with a computer.

foam
meter.

4.4 Surface
Tension Measurement
Surface
tension of different concentrations of surfactant solutions was registered
on a Krüss K100 tensiometer using the Wilhelmy plate method
at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. The glassware was cleaned with chromo
sulfuric acid, and the plate was burned prior to be used. The surfactant
solution was stirred for 3 min before each measurement, and each concentration
was measured three times to get average values for final use.

4.5 Interfacial Tension Test
The interfacial
tension between condensate oil and surfactant solution was measured
by a spinning drop tensiometer of Texas model 500 which has a measurement
range of 10–5 to 102 mN·m–1. The temperature was fixed at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C.

4.6 Stability Tracking of Pseudoemulsion Film
The stability
is tracked on a homemade apparatus according to an
earlier study (Figure 12).10 When an oil droplet is injected by
a syringe into the surfactant solution contained in the glass cylinder
(16 mm in diameter and 40 mm in height), it will move to contact the
gas–liquid interface, and then the pseudoemulsion film is formed
on the surface of the solution. The stability of the film is evaluated
by monitoring the time from the droplet touching the air–liquid
surface to the droplet rupture contacting the gas–liquid interface
to coalescing. For better visualization, the oil phase was dyed with
100 mg·L–1 oil red A, and a video of this process
was recorded.

of the pseudoemulsion
film.

4.7 Observation
of Oil Droplet–Foam Interaction
by CLSM
Confocal microscopy observation of foams was conducted
on a Zeiss LSM 700 CLSM. 0.01 wt % rhodamine B was used as the fluorescence
label of the foam film and microstructure in the foam liquid channels.
First, a surfactant solution was labeled by rhodamine B; then, foams
were created by highly agitating the surfactant solution in a Warning
blender. Second, a small volume of the foams was collected and placed
onto a glass slide for observation and excitation at 488 nm. The emitted
fluorescence was collected through a 515 nm filter, and images were
recorded at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels.
