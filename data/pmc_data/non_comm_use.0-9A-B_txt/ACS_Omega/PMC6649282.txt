The synthesis and self-assembled
nanostructures of a series of
nucleopeptides (NPs) derived from the dipeptide Phe–Phe and
the peptide nucleic acid unit which are covalently attached through
an amide or a triazole linker are described. Depending on the variables
such as protecting groups, linkers, and nucleobases, spherical nanoparticles
were observed through scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy images, and the porous nature of
representative NPs was corroborated by carboxyfluorescein entrapment.
Hydrophobic substituents on different sites of NPs and solvents employed
for peptide self-assembly played a crucial role for corresponding
morphologies. The stability of nanoparticles was also probed under
external stimuli such as pH, temperature, and enzymatic hydrolysis
using proteolytic enzymes. The semiconducting nature of the NP-modified
carbon electrodes suggested their potential use as a new capacitor
material.

1 Introduction
Self-assembly
of the dipeptide diphenylalanine (Phe–Phe)
has been widely studied by its crystal and amorphous solid-state structures
from mesoscopic to nanometric levels.1−5 Formation of discrete and well-ordered peptide nanotubes by Phe–Phe-derived
motifs that represent the key elements of the Alzheimer’s β-amyloid
peptide6 combined with their stability,
biocompatibility, and water solubility attributes make them ideal
for applications in biosensing and catalysis.7−11 Watson–Crick-specific base pairing in a nucleoside
domain is well known to unambiguous self-assembling systems.12 Recently, employing peptide nucleic acid (PNA)
dimers, Gazit et al. demonstrated that three guanine (G)-containing
analogues, viz., CG, GC, and GG, among the 16 possible dimer combinations
exhibit wide-range excitation-dependent fluorescence in the visible
region and unusual properties such as voltage-dependent electroluminescence.
These arise from a combination of both stacking interactions and Watson–Crick
base pairing as evident from the single-crystal structure of the GC
pair.13 The Fmoc-protected GC PNA dimer
also forms highly fluorescent aggregates14 exhibiting aggregation-induced emissions that promise new materials
for organic light-emitting diodes. Self-assembly of PNA N-capped G-monomer N-(N-Fmoc-2-aminoethyl)-N-[(N-6-Bhoc-9-guanyl)acetyl]-glycine [Fmoc-GNHBhoc-aeg-OH] leads to nanospheres with unique
optical15 and “structure color”16 properties, with formation of photonic crystals
useful for optoelectronics. Porphyrin and BODIPY conjugates of PNA
monomers have recently been reported as promising candidates for photocatalytic
applications.17

These parallel developments
in the self-assemblies of dipeptide
Phe–Phe and PNA G-monomer prompted us to explore the nucleopeptide
(NP) conjugates of Phe–Phe with monomeric PNA motifs to examine
their combined influence on mutual self-assembling properties. Previous
reports depicted the attachment of purine and pyrimidine nucleobases
at the N-terminus of the Phe–Phe motif through an amide (am) linker to design NPs such as (I)18 and (II)19 which behave as hydrogelators that facilitate the delivery of oligonucleotides
into human cells.19 Self-assembly of an
amphiphilic Phe–Phe (III)20 consisting of a hydrophobic alkyl tail at the N-terminus and a nucleobase
at the C-terminus elicited supramolecular nanohelices (Table 1) which were used to generate
plasmonic nanomaterials with/without incorporation of AuNPs. Nucleobase
peptide amphiphiles on dityrosine backbone (IV) formed
helical or curved rodlike micelles leading to gelation and interaction
with DNA.21 G-quartet and iron–terpyridine
(tpy) complex formation was exhibited simultaneously by tpy-tethered
NP V.22 Recently, self-assembly
of a series of NPs consisting of purine/pyrimidine nucleoside-conjugated
diphenylalanine (VI)23 was
shown to form stable spherical nanoparticles in a “molecular
necklace” fashion.

Nucleobases on a flexible PNA backbone
form facile base pairing
just as those on rather conformationally constrained ribose/deoxyribose
backbones. Hence, PNA monomers were conjugated to the C-terminus of
the Phe–Phe motif through different linkers [am and triazole (tz)], and the effects of hydrophobic
substituents (Boc, Cbz, iBu, etc.) and
nucleobases (A/G/C/T) were investigated on the self-assembly of Phe–Phe
NPs. The morphologies of these conjugated NPs were monitored through
microscopic techniques [scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and atomic force microscopy
(AFM)] and found to form hollow and solid nanospheres. The entrapment
of the carboxyfluorescein (CF) molecule in the hollow spherical particles
and the stability of these NPs against proteolytic enzymes were investigated.
Finally, the tz-modified NPs which showed porosity
and excellent stability prompted us to examine their possible semiconducting
behavior.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of Diphenylalanine–PNA-Conjugated
Peptides
Four NPs were synthesized through a solid-phase
peptide synthesis using a Boc strategy to afford unprotected NPs (Figure 1). For peptide synthesis,
Boc-Gly-OH and Boc-PNA monomers with suitable nucleobase protecting
groups were commercially available and Boc-Phe-Phe-OH (1) was synthesized according to the literature procedure. Here, Phe–Phe
was not directly coupled with a PNA analogue but tethered via a glycyl
linker. Unlike previous reports,20,22 the N-termini
of these peptides (NP1–4) are uncapped and discriminated
structurally by purine and pyrimidine nucleobases (A/C/G/T) being
attached. Therefore, these NPs are expected to self-assemble in different
patterns. According to the previous reports, substituents present
particularly at the N-termini of NPs play an important role for their
self-assembly.18−23 Therefore, to check the effect of hydrophobic substituents, PNA
monomers 2a–d with free −NH2 groups were coupled directly with Boc-Phe-Phe-OH (1) in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC·HCl) and N-hydroxybenzotriazole
(HOBt) (Scheme 1) to
afford conjugated peptides 3a–d in moderate to
good yields. Boc-Phe-Phe-propyne (4)23 was clicked with PNA-azides (5a–d)
using CuAAC-based click chemistry24,25 to yield the tz analogues of the conjugates (Scheme 2). 1,4-Disubstituted tz rings
are known bioisosteres of the trans-am bond of peptides26 but devoid of H-bond donor am (CONH) group which may affect the self-assembly process.

Figure 1 NPs without
C-/N-capping and hydrophobic substituents.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Fully Protected am-Linked NP 3a–d
Scheme 2 Synthesis of Fully Protected tz-Linked NP 6a–d
Again, to understand the role of capping groups at the
C- and N-termini,
partially protected NPs were synthesized. The N-Boc group of fully
substituted NPs (6c–d) was deprotected with trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) to afford peptides (7c–d) with free
amine groups at the N-termini, whereas ester hydrolysis of 6c–d under basic conditions produced NPs 8c–d with
free −CO2H groups. To obtain a control peptide without
purine/pyrimidine nucleobase, the intermediate 4 Boc-Phe-Phe-propyne
was clicked with the azide ethyl(2-azidoethyl)glycinate to afford
Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-aeg-OEt (9) (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Partially Protected NPs 7c, 7d, 8c, 8d, and Peptide 9
Peptides 3a–d, 6a–d, 7c, 7d, 8c, 8d, and 9 were purified by column
chromatography over silica gel and
structurally characterized by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS). Peptides NP1–NP4 were purified by reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Intermediate
PNA motifs with azide functionality, viz., 5a–e, were characterized by the typical infrared (IR) stretching frequency
of azide (νN3) at 2100 cm–1 (Supporting Information). The broad powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) data observed for the powder forms of NPs indicated
their noncrystalline nature (Figure S51 in the Supporting Information).

The characteristic am I bands observed between
1688 and 1643 cm–1 for all NPs (6a–d) indicated the probability of both parallel and antiparallel orientations
of peptide chains in a mini β-strand-type structure.27a For NPs 3b–d, a single
IR stretching frequency is observed around 1650 cm–1 in the am I region, indicating that β-strand
secondary structures may self-assemble in several ways.27 NPs 3a (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt), 3b (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-6-Cl-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt), 6c (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt), and 6d (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OEt) exhibited
strong am II bands around 1500 cm–1.

2.2 Morphologies and Microscopic Architectures
The morphology arising from the self-assembled structures of various
NP conjugates was monitored by SEM, HRTEM, and AFM techniques. Peptide
samples were prepared as mentioned in the reported experimental procedures.6 NPs were dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
(HFIP) (1 mg/mL) and lyophilized to obtain solid residues which were
dissolved further in 1:1 EtOH/H2O (1 mL). These freshly
prepared samples were used for microscopic analysis. Self-assembly
of completely deprotected NPs was observed first followed by partially
and fully protected analogues.

NPs NP1–NP4 without hydrophobic substituents exhibited a wide range of morphologies
depending on the attached nucleobases. The G-containing NP NP3 (H-Phe-Phe-gly-G-aeg-NH2) self-assembled
into small spherical nanoparticles (Figure 2C) with an average diameter of 15 nm. Although
thymine (T)-attached peptide NP4 (H-Phe-Phe-gly-T-aeg-NH2) assembled into nanoparticles (average
diameter: 200 nm) (Figure 2D), the adenine (A) analogue NP1 (H-Phe-Phe-gly-A-aeg-NH2) and the cytosine (C) NP2 (H-Phe-Phe-gly-C-aeg-NH2) aggregated
to form ill-defined clusters (Figure 2A,B). However, mixing of NP1 and NP2 with their respective complementary NPs (NP4 and NP3) was co-assembled to form better morphologies
than individual self-assemblies. A combination of A- and T-analogues
(NP1 and NP4, respectively) resulted in
aggregated nanoparticles (Figure 2E) while a similar mixture of C- and G-peptides (NP2 and NP3, respectively) produced nanowire-like
arrays upon aging (Figure 2F). These phenomena were mostly attributed to the base pair
effect. Complex formations by these two pairs of NPs were also confirmed
by the electrospray ionization (ESI+)–mass spectroscopy
(Figures S47–S50 in the Supporting Information).

Free amine and carboxylic groups
containing NPs (7c, d, and 8c, d) gave poorly
self-assembled morphologies (Figure 3). For example, 7c (H-Phe-Phe-tz-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt) and 7d (H-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OEt) with free −NH2 groups at the
N-termini produced small bead-like structures (Figure 3A,B), whereas the free −CO2H groups containing 8c (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-G-aeg-OH) and 8d (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OH) resulted in shapeless agglomeration
(Figure 3C,D). To check
the effect of chloride (Cl–) as a counter anion
for free N-termini containing NPs, the Boc groups of 6c and 6d were removed by 1 M HCl solution. Peptides 7c and 7d thus obtained with Cl– counter anion also did not produce ordered self-assembled morphologies
(Figure S61 in the Supporting Information).

(C) 8c (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-G-aeg-OH), and (D) 8d (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OH).

The SEM images for the
hydrophobic group-substituted NPs (3a–d and 6a–d) depicted spherical
nanoparticles with subtle variations. The am-linked
Phe–Phe PNA conjugates 3a (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt), 3b (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-6-Cl-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt), 3c (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt), and 3d (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-T-aeg-OEt) all exhibited solid spheres (Figure 4) with average diameters ranging from 0.5
to 1.0 μm, which was quite larger than unprotected G/T-NP analogues
described earlier (Figure 2). Evidently, nucleobases have less effect on the self-assembled
morphologies for the am-linked NPs.

Figure 4 SEM images of NP (A) 3a (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt), (B) 3b (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-6-Cl-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt),
(C) 3c (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt), and (D) 3d (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-T-aeg-OEt).

In comparison, most of the tz-linked analogues
(6a, b, d) exhibited porous
spheres (Figure 5)
with an average diameter for nanoparticles ranging from 0.45 to 0.9
μm. The NP 6b (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt) exhibited more perforated nanoparticle
surface than 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2-aeg-OEt) perhaps because
of the hydrophobic difference between Cbz and Boc. The SEM images
of 6c (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt) indicated a larger spherical
particle with uneven surface (Figure 5C), which was different from that seen for the rest
of the NPs. NP 6d (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OEt) formed interlinked, porous spherical nanoparticles
(Figure 5D), which
were not observed for its am analogue 3d. HRTEM and AFM analyses done on tz peptides affirmed
the hollowness of spherical nanoparticles observed in the SEM images.
NP 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2-aeg-OEt) showed a pronounced aperture
on the nanoparticle surface in HRTEM (Figure 6A), whereas the two other triazolyl NPs, 6b (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt) and 6d (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OEt), showed hollowness similar to 6a on spherical self-assembly (Figure 6B,D). The guanine-containing NP 6c (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt) showed nanospheres with uneven surface
(Figure 6C). When the
PNA moieties were attached to Phe–Phe through am bonds, viz., 3a (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt), 3b (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-6-Cl-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt), 3c (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt), and 3d (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-T-aeg-OEt), solid
spheres without perforation were observed in HRTEM (Figure 6E–H). The hollow spherical
self-assembly observed for tz peptides was clearly
visible from their height profiles recorded through AFM. AFM images
of the nanoparticles from 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2-aeg-OEt) and 6b (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt) clearly showed the hollow nature with the depth
found to be 20–60 nm (Figure 6I,J). The rough-surfaced and aggregated nanoparticles
were observed for NPs 6c and 6d, respectively
(Figure 6K,L). The
origin of pore formation on such spherical particles is attributed
to the processes involving both solvents and nonsolvents (here, water
is the nonsolvent in which the protected NPs are poorly soluble) proposed
by Feringa et al.28

The peptide 9 (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-aeg-OEt) devoid of purine and pyrimidine
nucleobase self-organized
to form large disk-like particles (Figure 7), which was apparently different form the
morphology generated from the rest of the protected and unprotected
NP analogues.

2.3 Contact Angle
The hydrophobic substituents
play a crucial role in forming an array of self-assembled structures.
The extent of hydrophobicity of these NPs was qualitatively ascertained
through contact angle (CA) measurements of water droplets on thin
layers of peptides on silicon wafers (Figures 8 and 9). The measured
CA values ranged from 70° to 95°, indicating their moderate
to high hydrophobicity.23,29 It was observed that
the G-containing NPs (3c and 6c) had CA
values above 90°, indicating high hydrophobicity while T (3d, 6d) and A-Cbz NPs (3a, 6b) had CA values less than 80°, being less hydrophobic
than G-analogues. The bis Boc-A NP 6a (CA = 88°)
and 6-chloro-G NP 3b (CA = 84°) were moderately
hydrophobic. As expected, the peptide with free amine 7d (H-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OEt) was less
hydrophobic with a lower CA value (70°). However, in the presence
of free carboxylic group, 8d (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OH) exhibited moderate hydrophobic nature
(CA = 81°). The control peptide 9 (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-aeg-OEt) for this study without nucleobase
showed lower hydrophobicity with a CA value of 71°. Corroboration
between SEM images and CA measurements clearly indicates the role
of hydrophobic substituents to produce ordered spherical nanoparticles.

2.4 Effect of External Stimuli
on NPs
Representative NPs with prominent and large self-assembled
nanoparticles
in this series were subjected for their thermal stability and influence
of external triggers such as different pHs and enzymes (proteinase
K and chymotrypsin). The nanoparticles from tz peptides 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2-aeg-OEt) and 6b (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt) sustained
their morphology beyond 100 °C. The thermal stability of representative
peptides 3b, 6b, and 6d was
confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) which confirmed their
stabilities up to 220 °C (Figure S62 in the Supporting Information). However, under pH 2 and pH 10, the
spherical assembly of 6a was completely disrupted, which
was attributed to the cleavage of acid- and base-labile hydrophobic
substituent, respectively (Figure 10). Both am- and tz-bridged NPs were proteolytically stable after incubation with proteinase
K and chymotrypsin as monitored by MALDI, HPLC trace analysis, and
SEM images (Figures 10 and S63–S65 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the NPs are more stable than unmodified diphenylalanine
(Phe–Phe) under similar proteolytic conditions.6

K.

2.5 Solvent-Dependent
Morphology of Nucleoeptide 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2-aeg-OEt)
The dependence of NP morphology
on different combinations was also investigated. As a representative
example, 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2-aeg-OEt) was chosen owing to its discrete
porous spherical nature observed thorough different microscopic techniques
and therefore easy to follow any deviation from original morphology.
Self-assembly of 6a was examined in pure tetrahydrofuran
(THF), MeOH, CHCl3, dichloromethane (DCM), and binary solvents,
viz., HFIP/water, MeOH/water, CHCl3/MeOH, and THF/water
in 1:1 ratio. It was noted that except for MeOH (Figure 11B), other pure solvents failed
to produce the spherical morphology (Figure 11A,C,D) reported earlier. However, in binary
solvent combinations, NP 6a assembled either into spherical
particles (Figure 11E,F,H) or aggregated large bubble (Figure 11G). Notably, such a solvent effect was observed
for both the highest and lowest hydrophobic peptide [3c (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt) and 7d (H-Phe-Phe-tz-T-aeg-OEt), respectively] (Figure S67
in the Supporting Information) in this
series. These observations suggested the crucial role of water as
a nonsolvent for the self-assembly process of NP.

2.6 Encapsulation and Release of Dye and Stimuli-Triggered
Disruption of Nanospheres
The stimuli-triggered release30 of dye and drug is one of the potent applications
for biomaterials. Here, the hollowness of peptide nanoparticles of 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2) allows encapsulation of CF.23,31,32 The confocal images for 6a show that
fluorescent molecules entered the cavity of spherical peptide nanoparticles
(Figure 12A) upon
incubation with CF. A similar experiment carried out with other tz peptides indicated subtle variations in their morphologies
(Table 2). The slow
release of CF after addition of dicationic dipeptide (Boc-Lys-Lys-OMe)23 into CF-loaded molecules (Figure 12B) confirmed that the fluorescent
small molecules were encapsulated inside the hollow nanoparticles
and not simply adhered on the outer layer. The amount of CF release
reached saturation after 30 h, which was relatively sluggish compared
to that seen with core–shell-like nanoparticles.23 A similar experiment was performed with an anticancer
drug doxorubicin which showed the same release kinetics under identical
condition (Figure S73 in the Supporting Information).

and without addition of dicationic peptide from peptide nanoparticles.

2.7 Turbidity Assay
The turbidity assay33 was performed for hydrophobic group-substituted
NPs following their absorbance at 405 nm (Figure 13 and Supporting Information), which showed that A-peptides 3a (Boc-Phe-Phe-am-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt), 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2-aeg-OEt), and 6b (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt) have greater tendency
to self-assemble than other NPs with high absorbance values. Guanine
peptides (3c, 6c) also showed the aggregation
property while T-peptides 3d, 6d, and 6-Cl-GNHiBu peptide (3b) were least
prone toward aggregation. This is attributed to better H-bonding and
π–π stacking abilities of purine nucleobases than
pyrimidine analogue thymine. The turbidity assay measured at 570 nm33b wavelength showed an identical pattern of absorbance
values which is used to check aggregation properties of Phe–Phe
containing NPs. In addition, the high aggregation tendency of 6a (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-AN(Boc)2-aeg-OEt) and 6b (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-ANHCbz-aeg-OEt) was also
confirmed from their increased polydispersity index values (from 0.03
to 0.34 and 0.07 to 0.57 for NP 6a and 6b, respectively) in DLS experiments and visualized in AFM and SEM
images recorded after 10 days of incubation of peptide solutions (Figure
S68 in the Supporting Information). The
increment of average particle size for 6a (0.45–1.8
μm) and 6b (0.32–0.77 μm) was noticed
after incubation.

at 405 nm.

2.8 Cyclic
Voltammetry of Modified Electrodes
We opined that the porous
self-assembled morphology of these NPs
might furnish semiconducting properties as bioinspired doping material.34 The porous nature of the peptide films may modify
electrode properties as it increases the effective surface area to
allow better interaction of electrolyte with the electrodes and reduce
the poor wettability of semiconducting materials like graphite and
carbon nanotubes. By employing vapor deposition technique to vertically
align diphenylalanine-peptide nanotubes, on modified electrodes, Gazit
and co-workers35 observed that such modifications
lead to better efficacy of hydrophobic graphite electrodes. These
electrodes had an advantage of longevity even after several cycles.36 Expecting such stability from porous Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-PNA, conductivity measurements were performed by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) on Torey carbon electrodes coated with peptides.

The current density response versus voltage for the trizole peptide-modified
electrode was found to be higher than that of an unmodified carbon
electrode. The CV profiles for all tested electrodes presented quite
rectangular (Figure 14) and symmetric shape, consistent even after 500 cycles, which is
a clear evidence of a double-layer capacitance charge–discharge
process with no faradaic effects.37 The
value of capacitance (Table 3) suggests that these peptides can be used as efficient supercapacitors.
The capacitance of the unmodified Torey carbon electrode was 90 μF/cm2. After modification, the G-peptide 6c (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-GNHiBu-aeg-OEt) exhibited the highest capacitance value of 617 μF/cm2, almost 7 times higher than that for the uncoated carbon
electrode. Electrodes coated with adenine- and thymine-modified peptides
(6a, b, and 6d, respectively)
displayed lower capacitance values than that of G-analogue, probably
attributed to the nature of self-assembly. As a control for NPs, peptide 9 (Boc-Phe-Phe-tz-aeg-OEt)
produced a capacitance value of 500 μF/cm2. However,
for peptide 9, a perturbed rectangular shape of current
density response curve was observed unlike the symmetric nature observed
for nuclopeptides (Supporting Information) indicating a faradaic process.

We proposed that the porous nature of tz-linked
NPs enhances the electrode–electrolyte contact, which leads
to the increment of the effective activation area of the modified
Torey carbon electrodes for electrical conductivity. Therefore, it
is expected that these self-assembled NPs with perforated morphology
to follow a similar mechanism as reported by Gazit et al.34−36 enhancing the capacitance of modified electrodes. Thus, without
a sophisticated vapor deposition method, simple thin layer coating
of these peptides resulted in attaining good capacitor efficacy (Experimental Section). Self-assembled peptide nanoparticles
can potentially create well-defined porous membranes, which can interact
with the electrolyte efficiently compared to bare and hydrophobic
Torey carbon electrodes used in this study.

3 Conclusions
A new series of NPs was synthesized and their
self-assembled morphologies
were monitored systematically. Self-assembly of these conjugates are
influenced by both Phe–Phe and PNA moieties. NPs without C-/N-termini
capping and free nucleobases did not show very good self-assembled
morphologies, whereas solid and porous nanospheres were obtained from
protected forms of Phe-Phe-PNA conjugates. Partial removal of capping
groups also leads to poorly organized agglomerated structures. Thus,
importance of hydrophobic substituents on nucleobases and C-/N-termini
of NP for self-assembled structures were observed. The extent of hydrophobicity
was assessed qualitatively by CA measurement. An equal mixture of
NPs with complementary base pairs elicited better nanoarchitectures
among completely deprotected analouges. Effects of linkers (tz/am) for protected NPs were evident from
self-assembled morphologies, albeit the reason is not clearly understood.
Effect of mixed solvent was crucial for consistent and regular morphologies
from these peptides. Adenine-containing NPs were more prone toward
self-aggregation as observed form the turbidity assay and DLS studies.
Representative  hydrophobic NPs were found stable under
a wide range of pH, high temperature, and proteolytic enzymes, which
showed their ability to behave as stable biocompatible templates.
Noncovalent encapsulation of CF inside the porous nanospheres was
evident from the confocal images. Slow release of dye from peptide
nanoparticle upon treatment of dicationic dipeptide as an external
stimulus. To utilize such porous nanoparticles in the field of bioelectronics,
Torey carbon electrodes were fabricated with tz-NPs and enhanced capacitance was measured. The guanine nucleobase
containing NP furnished the best result with a 7-fold increment of
the capacitance value compared to the bare, unmodified electrode.
Thus, NPs consisting of Phe–Phe and PNA motifs can be tuned
to engineer hybrid peptides with potential application as biomaterials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
All reagents
and proteolytic enzymes were commercially purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Column chromatographic separations were done using silica gel (230–400
mesh). Solvents were dried and distilled following standard procedures.
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on precoated plates
(Merck silica gel 60, F254) and the spots were visualized
with UV light or by charring the plates by dipping in 5% ninhydrin
in n-butanol solutions. 1H NMR (400 MHz)
and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker
NMR spectrometer. All 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded in CDCl3, CD3OD, and DMSO-d6. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per
million (ppm, δ scale). Mass spectroscopy data were obtained
from a Synapt G2QTof mass spectrometer in ESI+ mode. Melting
points were determined in open-end capillary tubes and uncorrected.
UV–vis measurements were made using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(model Lambda 25).

The self-assembly process of the peptides
was monitored after 1 mg/mL was dissolved in HFIP, lyophilized, and
then diluted with 50% ethanol in water.

4.2 Synthesis
of NPs on Solid Phase
The
Boc-PNA monomers Boc-Gly-OH and Boc-Phe-Phe-OH were incorporated into
a peptide sequence by solid-phase synthesis on an MBHA resin having
0.67 mmol/g loading value without further reduction of loading capacity.
After swelling of resin beads in DCM overnight, these were washed
with 15% N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA) in DCM (3 × 10 min) to generate free amines from the
commercially available salt form. Free amine groups were then coupled
with carboxylic acid of PNA monomers first in dry dimethylformamide
(DMF) (0.5 mL) using HOBt (3 equiv), 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (3 equiv), and DIPEA (3 equiv). The reagents were
removed by filtration and washed with DMF (3 × 10 mL) and DCM
(3 × 10 mL). Deprotection of Boc group from the N-terminus of
the resin-bound PNA monomers with 50% TFA in DCM (3 × 15 min)
was followed by washing with DCM and DMF (3 × 10 mL) to give
a TFA salt of amine which was neutralized using 10% DIPEA in DCM (3
× 10 min) to generate free amine. After washing with DCM and
DMF (3 × 10 mL), the free amine was coupled with carboxylic acid
of incoming monomers (Boc-Gly-OH and Boc-Phe-Phe-OH) in dry DMF (0.5
mL) under an aforementioned am coupling condition.
The protocol for washing and regeneration of free amine was repeated
to afford the desired peptides. The resin-bound peptides were cleaved
from solid support by TFA and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.

4.3 Purification of NPs by Reverse-Phase HPLC
Purification
of NPs was performed through a semipreparative BEH130
C18 (10 × 250 mm) column with the following gradient elution
method: 100% A to 100% B in 33 min; A = 0.1% TFA in CH3CN/H2O (5:95); B = 0.1% TFA in CH3CN/H2O (1:1) with a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Oligomers were monitored
at 220 and 260 nm wavelengths during purification.

4.5 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were
recorded from a
FT-IR (Bruker alpha-E) spectrophotometer.

4.6 PXRD
Study
The crystalline nature
of the peptides was characterized by PXRD using a Bruker D8 Advance
Series-II PXRD. Cu Kα radiation and a Lynxeye 1-D detector were
used to record powder diffraction data. A goniometer was configured
in theta–theta Bragg Brentano geometry optimized to obtain
best intensity and resolution on bulk powder samples. The peptides
were dried under vacuum before PXRD data were taken.

4.7 Dynamic Light Scattering
Dynamic
light scattering (DLS) experiments was performed through a Nano ZS-90
apparatus (633 nm red laser beam at 90° angle) from Malvern instruments
to find the size and dispersity of NP nanoparticles. The average size
values are reported after at least three consecutive measurements.

4.8 Microscopy Studies
Microscopy experiments
were performed to characterize the size of the self-assembled nanoparticles.
Samples were prepared carefully to minimize the effect of aggregation.
Then, 3–4 μL of peptide solutions was drop-casted on
different substrates followed by drying under high vacuum [Formvar
coated Cu grid for HRTEM, silicon wafer substrate for AFM, and field
emission SEM (FESEM)]. FESEM images were recorded using Zeiss Ultra
Plus scanning electron microscope after gold coating. AFM images were
recorded using Agilent instruments. The imaging was carried out in
tapping mode using a TAP-190AL-G50 probe from Budget sensors which
had a nominal spring constant of 48 N/m and the resonance frequency
of 190. HRTEM images were captured through a 1024 × 1024 digital
CCD camera using a Tecnai-G220-TWIN microscope instrument.

SEM samples were prepared by drop-casting NP and control peptide
solutions (3 μL, concentration: 1 mg/mL in 50:50 EtOH/H2O after lyophilization in 1 mL HFIP) on silicon wafers. Silicon
wafers were then dried at rt for 2 days and imaged. Similarly, HRTEM
samples were prepared by depositing NP solutions (3 μL, concentration:
1 mg/mL in 50:50 EtOH/H2O) on a copper grid, dried at rt
for 1 day, and then imaged. For AFM, samples were drop-casted on freshly
cleaved silicon wafers, air-dried at rt for 2–3 days. Tapping
mode was applied for AFM imaging according to the reported procedures.

4.9 Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermogravimetric
analyses were carried out in a PerkinElmer STA 6000 simultaneous thermal
analyzer. The exact parameters of the physical stability of self-assembled
peptide vesicles were determined through TGA. The weight loss is monitored
as a function of increasing temperature. Analysis was conducted isothermally
for 30 min at rt followed by a scan rate of 5 °C/min up to 750
°C. Experiments were performed under dry condition and ultrahigh
purity argon atmosphere.

4.10 CF Encapsulation Study
CF (1.3 mM)
and doxorubicin (1.8 μM) solutions were added to the peptide
vesicle solution of peptide 6a to make the final concentration
of 0.1 mM and 0.2 μM, respectively, kept it overnight, and dialyzed
with a 500 D cutoff dialysis tube (Float-A-Lyzer G2 Dialysis Device,
Spectrum Labs). CF and doxorubicin-entrapped vesicles solutions were
drop-casted on glass slides, dried, and then imaged using Carl Zeiss
LSM-710 laser scanning confocal microscopy. A laser scanning confocal
microscope reveals the green and red fluorescence emissions from the
CF and doxorubicin-entrapped nanostructures, respectively, suggesting
the encapsulation of dye molecules in the nanospheres.

4.11 Dicationic Dipeptide-Mediated Release
Porous peptide
nanoparticles of 6a (200 μL) loaded
with CF/doxorubicin was sealed in a dialysis membrane. Dicationic
dipeptide (Boc-Lys-Lys-OMe) (200 μL, 5 mM) was then added to
it. The dialysis bag was then suspended in agitating ethanol/water
(1:1) solution. Aliquot (300 μL) of solution outside the dialysis
bag was collected at different intervals for the quantification of
released CF/doxorubicin. Dye/drug release measurement experiments
were carried out using Fluorolog-3 HORIBA Jobin Yvon fluorescence
fluorimeter, with 417 and 480 nm excitation and 437–750 nm
emission range using 1/1 slit and 1 nm data interval.

4.12 CA Measurement
To check the hydrophobicity
of the synthetic peptides, CA measurements were carried out. CAs on
the peptide-coated silicon wafers were measured by using a contact
angle meter (model ID: HO-IAD-CAM-01, Holmarc Opto-Mechatronics Pvt.
Ltd.), which was followed by LBADSA drop analysis (ImageJ Software).
For these measurements, a 2 × 2 cm2 uniform area of
silicon wafers was accurately cut, washed with Milli Q water and methanol,
and dried well. Uniform thin layers of NPs were prepared after slow
drop-casting of 4 μL per droplet of samples (dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH) and dried well at rt. The CA measurements were recorded
four consecutive times from different areas of the sample and captured
at 0.5 s, following which the average CA value was calculated.

4.13 Turbidity Assay Experiment
Turbidity
assay experiment was done in the 96-well microtest plate flat-bottom
wells (Tarsons, CAT no. 941196) by using VARIOSKAN FLASH (Thermo scientific).
Peptide samples were placed (400 μL, 1 mg/400 μL in 50:50
EtOH/H2O after lyophilization in 1 mL HFIP) in 96-well
microtest plate flat-bottom wells (Tarsons, CAT no. 941196).

4.14 Electrochemical Analysis
Electrochemical
analysis was done in the Biologic VMP3 multichannel potentiostat.
A standard three-electrode cell consisting of a Toray carbon paper
having 1 cm2 as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)
as the reference electrode, and a Pt foil as the counter electrode
were used for electrochemical measurements. The solutions were purged
with Ar during the experiments. The potential values are in the standard
hydrogen electrode scale.

All solutions were prepared using
triple-distilled water and the cell temperature was maintained at
27 °C. Currents are normalized with respect to geometric area
(1 cm2). All the electrolytic solutions were prepared by
0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer electrolytes at pH = 7.4 and 0.1
