In this paper, we tested a hypothesis
that the metal-assisted and
microwave-accelerated decrystallization (MAMAD) technique, based on
the combined use of low-power medical microwave heating (MWH) and
gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), can be used to decrystallize laboratory-prepared
monosodium urate monohydrate crystal aggregate (pseudo-tophus) placed
in three-dimensional (3D) synthetic human joint models. To simulate
a potential treatment of chronic tophaceous gout using the MAMAD technique,
we used three different 3D synthetic human joint models and assessed
the percent mass reduction (PMR, i.e., decrystallization) of pseudo-tophus
and microwave-induced synthetic skin patch damage after MAMAD sessions
(a MAMAD session = 120 s of MWH in the presence of Au NPs). Our three
synthetic joint models are: Model 1: Application of seven MAMAD sessions
in a closed synthetic joint with a pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus
submerged in a solution of 20 nm Au NPs followed by dehydration of
pseudo-tophus after each MAMAD session to assess PMR. Model 2: Application
of seven MAMAD sessions in a closed or open synthetic joint with a
pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus submerged in a solution of
Au NPs followed by intermittent dehydration of pseudo-tophus after
seven MAMAD sessions to assess PMR. Model 3: Application of 18 MAMAD
sessions in a rotated closed synthetic joint (three sides are heated
separately) with a pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus submerged
in a solution of Au NPs followed by dehydration after every three
MAMAD sessions to assess PMR. After a single MAMAD session, pseudo-tophus
exposed to MWH and Au NPs had an average PMR of 8.30% (up to an overall
PMR of 15%), and microwave-induced damage to the synthetic skin can
be controlled by the use of a sacrificial skin sample and by adjusting
the duration and the number of the MAMAD sessions. Computational electromagnetic
simulations predict a 10% absorption of electric field by the pseudo-tophus
placed in the synthetic joint models, which led us to conclude that
a medical microwave source with higher power than 20 W can potentially
be used with the MAMAD technique.

Introduction
Gout
is a crystal deposition disease commonly associated with metabolic
syndrome and without proper management and therapy can cause permanent
damage to an afflicted human joint.1−3 Hyperuricemia, a precursor
to the development of gout, occurs when supersaturated systemic uric
acid crystals precipitate and nucleate in human joints.4−6 Hyperuricemia (2%) occurs when supersaturated systemic uric acid
produced from the catabolism of purines is excreted from the body
in urine, and 98% of the ionic form remains in circulation.7−10 Monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM), the mono-protonated ionic form
of hyperuricemia occurs when supersaturated systemic uric acid, circulates
in the blood plasma and synovial fluid of joints. The presence of
MSUM crystals in soft tissues is indicative of acute gout, and the
accumulation of intradermal, intra-articular deposits of nodular MSUM
crystals (i.e., tophus) in the synovial fluid of joints is an indicator
of chronic tophaceous gout.

Corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory
agents), colchicine (an antipyretic
agent), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (analgesic agents)
are currently used for the management of acute gout.11−15 Management of chronic gout can involve surgical removal of tophus,
a procedure that is invasive and can lead to permanent joint damage.
Numerous adverse effects associated with the use of current pharmaceuticals
for the treatment of acute and chronic gout necessitate the development
of minimally invasive new treatments for gout and, potentially, other
crystal deposition diseases.

In response to the need for treatments
for gout, our research group
has developed a technique, called metal-assisted and microwave-accelerated
decrystallization (MAMAD),16,17 which combines the
use of Au nanoparticles (NPs) in solution and microwave heating (MWH),
as a potential therapeutic aid. In the MAMAD technique, MWH of target
crystals in the presence of Au NPs is used to create a temperature
gradient between the Au NPs, water, and the crystals in solution,
increasing the kinetic energy of the Au NPs. When the kinetic energy
of the Au NPs increases with MWH, Au NPs act as “nanobullets,”18 resulting in increased collisions between the
Au NPs and the target crystals, which causes break up and eventually
decrystallization of the target crystals.19 To date, we have demonstrated the application of the MAMAD technique
on planar surfaces using uric acid crystals as a model for small crystals
and l-alanine crystals as a model for large crystals. Recently,
we have established a synthetic human finger joint model using three-dimensional
(3D)-printed plastic bones and synthetic skin.20 We have previously shown that large-sized (>400 μm) l-alanine crystals in a solution of Au NPs could be decrystallized
entirely by low-power MWH through a synthetic skin patch.18 However, l-alanine was used as a model
crystal in our two-dimensional (2D) model, which is not representative
of the tophus seen in individuals with tophaceous gout, which motivated
us to employ our MAMAD technique for the decrystallization of pseudo-tophus
in 3D models that mimic gout tophus in human joints.

In this
proof-of-principle study, we tested the hypothesis that
our MAMAD technique can be used to decrystallize MSUM pseudo-tophus
using an 8 GHz low-power (maximum power: 20 W) medical microwave source
in the presence of Au NPs using three synthetic human joint models.
To mimic tophaceous gout in a human joint, a pseudo-tophus was submerged
in a solution of Au NPs, enclosed in a pseudo-bursa made of a thin
plastic enclosure, and embedded in the articular space of our closed
synthetic joint covered with a synthetic skin patch or in an open
synthetic joint covered with a glass coverslip. In each synthetic
human joint model used, we determined the percent mass reduction (PMR)
of each pseudo-tophus after each MAMAD session. Throughout these experimental
sessions, the temperatures of the synthetic joints, exposed to our
MAMAD technique, were monitored via an interjoint fiber optic temperature
probe to determine whether MWH caused temperature increases in the
synthetic joints that exceeded the physiological range. We also qualitatively
assessed the integrity of the synthetic skin patches used to cover
the closed synthetic joints for microwave-induced damage via optical
microscopy. We carried out finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations
of the electric field distribution throughout the synthetic joint
models. These results offer a closer step to the applicability of
the MAMAD technique as a potential alternative treatment for gout
or other crystal deposition diseases in humans after animal trials.

Results
and Discussion
Since this study contains three different
synthetic joint models,
it is important to first introduce these models and summarize the
differences between them in the first few paragraphs below and then
present our findings. Detailed information on the synthetic joint
models is provided in the Materials and Methods. Figure 1 shows model
1, where seven MAMAD sessions (5 W; 1 MAMAD session = 30 s ×
4 intermittent MWH = 120 s; 7 MAMAD sessions = 840 s of MWH) were
applied to a closed synthetic joint (covered by a sacrificial synthetic
skin patch) embedded with a pseudo-bursa, containing a pseudo-tophus
submerged in a 500 μL solution of Au NPs (20 nm in diameter)
and dehydrated for 1 h after each MAMAD session. In these experiments,
we used the closed synthetic joint as the more stringent model compared
to the open synthetic joint (microwave heating is applied to tophus
in the absence of a sacrificial synthetic skin patch). That is, if
pseudo-tophus decrystallization occurred under a synthetic skin patch,
then it would occur under a glass coverslip. From these experiments,
we learned that the pseudo-tophus should be submerged in a larger
volume of Au NP solution, and that dehydration after every MAMAD sessions
is time consuming without additional benefits. It is important to
note that the choice of 20 nm Au NPs is based on the ease of human
body to clear Au NPs at these sizes, and the fact that Au NPs are
Food and Drug Administration approved for use in humans.

of seven MAMAD sessions in a closed synthetic
joint with a pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus submerged in
Au NPs with dehydration after each MAMAD session. Schematic representation
of a pseudo-bursa (plastic pouch) containing a MSUM pseudo-tophus,
submerged in a 500 μL solution of Au NPs embedded in a closed
synthetic joint covered by a synthetic skin patch, and exposed to
MWH (5 W) for seven MAMAD sessions, applied at 30 s intervals (1 MAMAD
session = 4 × 30 s = 120 s × 7 sessions = 840 s of MWH)
followed by dehydration for 1 h after each session. After each MAMAD
session, the pseudo-tophus was removed from the pseudo-bursa, dehydrated,
and weighed to determine the PMR. The internal temperature of the
closed synthetic joint was monitored with an interjoint fiber optic
temperature probe. Microwave-induced damage to the synthetic skin
patch was assessed after each MAMAD session.

Figure 2 shows
model
2, where seven MAMAD sessions (5 W; 120 s × 7 MAMAD sessions
= 840 s of MWH) or an equivalent duration of ambient temperature (AT,
no microwave heating, 17–18 °C) were applied to a closed
or an open synthetic joint (covered by a 18 mm × 18 mm, 0.13
mm thick glass coverslip) embedded with a pseudo-bursa, containing
a pseudo-tophus submerged in an 800 μL solution of Au NPs (20
nm in diameter, note the increase in volume of Au NP solution based
on our observations in model 1 as described in the text) or deionized
(DI) water and dehydrated for 1 h after seven MAMAD sessions. In these
experiments, we compared the extent of pseudo-tophus decrystallization
in closed and open synthetic joints. Although the Au NPs were suspended
in a mild citrate buffer, containing a proprietary surfactant as a
stabilizer, we chose to use deionized water as the Au NP control.
From these experiments, we learned that dehydration step after seven
MAMAD sessions is preferable to minimize experimental error in assessing
the PMR.

at 30 s intervals or an equivalent duration of ambient temperature
(17–18 °C) followed by dehydration for 1 h after 7 MAMAD
session. The pseudo-tophus was removed from the pseudo-bursa, dehydrated,
and weighed to determine the PMR. Internal temperatures of the closed
and open synthetic joints were monitored with an interjoint fiber
optic temperature probe. Microwave-induced damage to the synthetic
skin patch was assessed after each MAMAD session.

3, where 18 MAMAD sessions (5 W; 18 MAMAD sessions = 3 × 120
s MAMAD sessions (on the right, top, and left sides of the closed
synthetic joint) = 360 s × 6 trials = 2160 s of MWH) were applied
to a rotated closed synthetic joint (MWH on three sides of joint)
embedded with a pseudo-bursa, containing a pseudo-tophus submerged
in an 800 μL solution of Au NPs (20 nm) and dehydrated for 1
h after every three MAMAD sessions (after each side). In the experiments
for model 3, we focused on the closed synthetic joint because we wanted
to determine if MWH is applied to the closed synthetic joint on three
sides, will fewer MAMAD sessions may be required. Our observations
and detailed discussions on the application of the MAMAD technique
to each synthetic human joint model are described below.

18 MAMAD sessions followed by dehydration for 1 h after every three
MAMAD sessions. The pseudo-tophus was removed from the pseudo-bursa,
dehydrated, and weighed to determine the PMR. The internal temperature
of the closed synthetic joint was monitored with an interjoint fiber
optic temperature probe.

Model 1: Application of Seven MAMAD Sessions in a Closed Synthetic
Joint with a Pseudo-Bursa (Plastic Pouch) Containing a Pseudo-Tophus
Submerged in Au NPs and Dehydrated after Each MAMAD Session
Figure 4a shows real-color
images of one of the model 1 three different pseudo-tophus that was
submerged in a 500 μL solution of Au NPs (20 nm) in a pseudo-bursa,
which was embedded in a closed synthetic joint covered by a synthetic
skin patch, after the application of seven MAMAD sessions or at AT
(i.e., no MWH). Figure 4b shows the average PMR calculated for three different pseudo-tophus,
after each session, pseudo-tophus samples were exposed to the MAMAD
technique, microwaves in the absence of Au NPs and at AT in the presence
of Au NPs or deionized water. The pseudo-tophus shown in Figure 4 (initial mass: 486
mg) had a PMR of 8.30% (31 mg) after seven MAMAD sessions. The pseudo-tophus
was dehydrated for 1 h after seven MAMAD sessions and weighed. The
PMR of 5.40% (44 mg) was observed in the control sample (initial mass:
582 mg) at AT in the presence of Au NPs. The PMR of 5.51% (9 mg) was
observed in the control sample (initial mass: 167 mg) with MWH in
the absence of Au NPs. The PMR of 4.45% (9 mg) was observed in the
control sample (initial mass: 205 mg) at AT in the absence of Au NPs.

session, pseudo-tophus was removed from the pseudo-bursa, dehydrated,
and weighed. (b) The table shows the average PMR calculated for four
different pseudo-tophus sample groups, after each 120 s session (MAMAD,

shows
real-color images of four different model 1 pseudo-tophus samples,
in pseudo-bursas, dehydrated Au NPs solutions and pseudo-tophus samples,
and microwave-induced synthetic skin patch damage. Figure 5b shows the change in the temperature
of the four closed synthetic joints after 120 s of MWH. After each
MAMAD session, each pseudo-tophus was removed from the pseudo-bursa,
dehydrated, and weighed to determine the PMR. The internal temperature
of each closed synthetic joint was monitored with a temperature probe.
Qualitative microwave-induced damage to the synthetic skin patch was
assessed using a digital camera after each MAMAD session. The increases
in temperature for the four closed synthetic joints, during MWH were,
6.8, 5.6, 1.7, and 4.9 °C.

Figure S1a shows measured mass of pseudo-tophus,
pseudo-tophus + Au NPs, wet and dry pseudo-tophus, the pseudo-tophus
mass difference, and the average PMR after seven MAMAD sessions. The
pseudo-tophus (initial mass: 305 mg) before the initiation of the
MAMAD sessions and the addition of 500 μL solution of Au NPs
gradually decreased the mass of the pseudo-tophus via the dissolution
process. After the pseudo-tophus was removed from the pseudo-bursa
and dehydrated, the mass decreased to 293 mg (3.93%). Figure S1b shows a graph of microwave-induced
temperature changes recorded at 30 s intervals during seven MAMAD
sessions. The largest change in the temperature of the closed synthetic
joint was during MAMAD session 5 between 30 and 60 s. Figure S1c shows the duration for microwave-induced
synthetic skin patch damage during each MAMAD session.

Model 2: Application
of Seven MAMAD Sessions in a Closed or
Open Synthetic Joint with a Pseudo-Bursa Containing a Pseudo-Tophus
Submerged in Au NPs and Dehydrated after Seven MAMAD Sessions
Table 1 summarizes
the calculated PMR from three different pseudo-tophus submerged in
800 μL solutions of Au NPs or deionized water in pseudo-bursas,
which were embedded in closed synthetic joints covered by synthetic
skin patches (Table 1a) or in open synthetic joints covered by glass coverslips (Table 1b). Pseudo-tophus
samples were exposed to ambient temperature (AT; 17–18 °C)
or MWH for seven sessions in the presence of Au NPs or deionized water
(7 MAMAD sessions = 840 s of MWH in the presence of Au NPs) with dehydration
for 1 h after seven MAMAD sessions. For each of the three pseudo-tophus,
the initial pseudo-tophus mass (mg), the PMR (%) after seven MAMAD
sessions, the final pseudo-tophus mass (mg), the mass reduction (mg),
and the PMR (%) of pseudo-tophus and the average PMR (%) of all three
pseudo-tophus were recorded under four conditions: control: AT + Au
NPs; MAMAD: MWH + Au NPs; control: AT + deionized water; and control:
MWH + deionized water. Model 2 pseudo-tophus were dehydrated for 1
h after seven MAMAD sessions. Control pseudo-tophus samples were kept
at AT in the presence of Au NPs or deionized water and exposed to
MWH in the presence of deionized water for the duration equal to that
of the seven MAMAD sessions.

Table 1 Model 2: Seven MAMAD
Sessions in a
Closed or Open Synthetic Joint with Three Different Pseudo-Bursae
Each Containing a Pseudo-Tophus Submerged in Au NPs and Dehydrated
after Seven MAMAD Sessionsa
a Each
of three different pseudo-tophus
was submerged in 800 μL solutions of Au NPs or deionized water
in pseudo-bursa, which were embedded (a) in closed synthetic joints
with synthetic skin patches or (b) in open synthetic joints with glass
coverslips and exposed to ambient temperature (17–18 °C)
to seven MAMAD sessions (5 W; 840 s of MWH) with dehydration for 1
h after seven MAMAD sessions. For each of the three pseudo-tophus,
the initial pseudo-tophus mass (mg), the PMR (%) after seven MAMAD
session, the final pseudo-tophus mass (mg), the mass reduction (mg),
and the PMR (%) of pseudo-tophus and the average PMR (%) of all three
pseudo-tophus were recorded under four conditions: control: ambient
temperature + Au NPs; MAMAD: MWH + Au NPs; control: AT + deionized
water and MWH + deionized water.

For the closed synthetic joint, the largest PMR occurred using
the MAMAD technique: MWH + Au NPs treatment group with an initial
average mass of 187 ± 53.8 mg. The PMR, after the seven MAMAD
sessions for all three closed synthetic joints, was 11.5 ± 1.82%;
Moreover, the pseudo-tophus in the open joint had an initial mass
of 311 ± 124 mg, before the commencement of seven MAMAD sessions
and a final average mass of 294 ± 120 mg after the MAMAD sessions
concluded. The PMR after the initial seven MAMAD sessions for all
three open synthetic joints was 5.89 ± 1.59%. The treatment groups
exposed to MWH + Au NPs for seven MAMAD sessions had the overall mass
of pseudo-tophus in the closed synthetic joint and the open synthetic
joint reduced by 11.5 ± 1.82 and 5.89 ± 1.59%, respectively.

The pseudo-tophus in the control group in the presence of Au NPs
and at AT (no MWH) in the closed joint had an initial mass of 416
± 61.5 mg and a mass of 391 ± 57.7 mg after the duration
of seven MAMAD sessions. The PMR after the duration of seven MAMAD
sessions for all three closed synthetic joints was 6.08 ± 0.01%.
The pseudo-tophus in the presence of Au NPs and at AT (no MWH) in
the open joint had an initial mass of 472 ± 117 mg before and
a final mass of 460 ± 114 mg after the duration of seven MAMAD
sessions. The PMR after seven MAMAD sessions for all three open synthetic
joints was 2.57 ± 1.13%. The control group exposed to AT + Au
NPs for seven MAMAD sessions had the overall mass of pseudo-tophus
in the closed synthetic joint and the open synthetic joint reduced
by 6.08 ± 0.01 and 2.57 ± 1.12%, respectively.

The
control pseudo-tophus submerged in deionized water (without
Au NPs) in the closed joint at AT had an initial mass of 205 ±
13.5 mg before and a final mass of 197 ± 13.0 mg after the duration
of seven MAMAD sessions. The PMR after the duration of seven MAMAD
sessions for all three closed synthetic joints was 3.91 ± 0.42%.
The pseudo-tophus at AT (no MWH) + deionized water in the open joint
had an initial mass of 173 ± 20 mg before and a final mass of
164 ± 15.6 mg after the duration of seven MAMAD sessions. The
PMR after the seven MAMAD sessions for all three open synthetic joints
was 5.42 ± 2.43%. The treatment groups exposed to AT + deionized
water for seven MAMAD sessions had the overall mass of pseudo-tophus
in the closed synthetic joint and the open synthetic joint reduced
by 3.91 ± 0.42 and 5.42 ± 2.43%, respectively.

The
control pseudo-tophus submerged in deionized water (without
Au NPs) in the closed joint exposed to MWH had an initial mass of
154 ± 11.7 mg before and a final mass of 146 ± 10.4 mg after
the duration of seven MAMAD sessions. The PMR after the duration of
seven MAMAD sessions for all three closed synthetic joints was 5.17
± 0.91%. The pseudo-tophus at MWH + deionized water in the open
joint had an initial mass of 132 ± 0.58 mg before and a final
mass of 124 ± 0.28 mg after the duration of seven MAMAD sessions.
The PMR after the seven MAMAD sessions for all three open synthetic
joints was 6.07 ± 0.06%. The treatment groups exposed to MWH
+ deionized water for seven MAMAD sessions had the overall mass of
pseudo-tophus in the closed synthetic joint and the open synthetic
joint reduced by 3.91 ± 0.42 and 5.42 ± 2.43%, respectively.

Figure 6a shows
real-color images of an open synthetic joint (model 2), a temperature
probe, and an embedded pseudo-tophus before and after seven MAMAD
sessions. Figure 6b
shows real-color images of the weight (in milligram) of the pseudo-tophus
after removal from the Au NP solution and after dehydration for 1
h following upon completion of seven MAMAD sessions. The initial mass
of pseudo-tophus was 428 mg, and after seven MAMAD sessions and dehydration,
the pseudo-tophus weighed 401 mg, which is a 21.5 mg decrease from
the initial mass. Without dehydration after each MAMAD session (as
was done in model 1), the weight of the pseudo-tophus increased with
each MAMAD session.

synthetic
joint exposed to seven MAMAD sessions followed by dehydration of pseudo-tophus
after seven MAMAD sessions. (a) Real-color images of a pseudo-tophus
that was submerged in an 800 μL solution of Au NPs, which was
in a pseudo-bursa embedded in an open synthetic joint with an interjoint
temperature probe, before and after seven MAMAD sessions. (b) Real-color
images of the weight of a pseudo-tophus after each MAMAD session and
after dehydration (note: the weight of the pseudo-tophus increases
with each MAMAD session).

Figure S2a shows the time (in
seconds)
to microwave-induced damage to synthetic skin patches from three closed
synthetic joints during exposure to seven MAMAD sessions. Figure S2b shows microwave-induced temperature
changes in a closed synthetic joint during seven MAMAD sessions at
30 s intervals. It is important to note that the synthetic skin patch
was changed after each MAMAD session to simulate the use of sacrificial
synthetic skin samples to alleviate potential microwave-induced pain
in humans. The change in temperature was also monitored per MAMAD
session in the closed and open synthetic joints. Figure S3 shows the internal temperature changes for three
different model 2 closed and open synthetic joints, as monitored via
an interjoint temperature probe during exposure to seven MAMAD sessions.
It is interesting to note that the final temperatures of both the
closed and open synthetic joints remained in the initial temperature
ranges, which demonstrates that MWH does not cause significant increases
in temperature. This is an important observation for the future potential
use of the MAMAD technique in humans with gout.

To visually
demonstrate the effect of the combined used of Au NPs
and MWH on the pseudo-tophus in synthetic joint models, we collected
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pseudo-tophus before
and after MAMAD sessions and control experiments. Figure 7 shows the SEM images of dry
pseudo-tophus, pseudo-tophus in deionized water and pseudo-tophus
in Au NPs, control pseudo-tophus or pseudo-tophus without microwave
exposure after seven MAMAD sessions. We used dry pseudo-tophus as
a baseline for pseudo-tophus in deionized water and pseudo-tophus
in Au NPs. The surface of the dry pseudo-tophus appeared smooth without
any pores at the largest observation scale (200 μm). However,
with higher magnification (i.e., scales marked as 50, 10, and 2 μm),
we observed that dry pseudo-tophus were needle-like in structure,
similar to those observed in humans (see also Figures S5 and S6 for larger images).

Figure 7 Model 2: application
of seven MAMAD sessions in a closed joint
with a pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus submerged in Au NPs
and dehydrated after seven MAMAD sessions. SEM images of pseudo-tophus
after application of seven MAMAD sessions in a closed joint with a
pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus submerged in Au NPs and dehydrated
after seven MAMAD sessions. Dry tophus is a control sample and shows
the surface properties of the tophus before the application of seven
MAMAD sessions. See Supporting Information for larger SEM images.

Contrarily, pseudo-tophus in deionized water and pseudo-tophus
in Au NPs without application of microwave heating (i.e., AT) displayed
different surface properties: pseudo-tophus in deionized water were
more porous than dry pseudo-tophus, which indicates a partial dissolving
of pseudo-tophus components by water and serves as a baseline for
comparison with the MAMAD technique. Pseudo-tophus in Au NPs were
also more porous than dry pseudo-tophus, but pseudo-tophus in Au NPs
displayed larger pores than pseudo-tophus in deionized water. Both
pseudo-tophus in deionized water and pseudo-tophus in Au NPs without
application of microwaves displayed needle-like crystals with higher
magnification (i.e., 50, 10, and 2 μm). These results imply
that the use of Au NPs alone does not remove the sharp corners of
MSUM crystals.

After application of MWH, pseudo-tophus in deionized
water displayed
a porous surface (see image with a scale bar of 200 μm). However,
these pores were larger compared to pseudo-tophus in deionized water
without exposure to MWH. Sharp corners of MSUM crystals in the pseudo-tophus
exposed to MAMAD technique were not as distinct compared to pseudo-tophus
in Au NPs without MWH. We observed that the combination of Au NPs
and MWH caused the surface of pseudo-tophus to be more porous. Notably,
at higher magnification, we did not observe individual MSUM crystals
in pseudo-tophus exposed to the MAMAD technique, indicating that the
MAMAD technique did indeed cause more characteristic structural changes
to pseudo-tophus after the seven MAMAD sessions. These observations
visually demonstrate the effectiveness of the MAMAD technique in decrystallization
of pseudo-tophus as compared to control experiments in a 3D synthetic
human joint model.

of 18 MAMAD sessions (3 × MAMAD sessions on the right, top, and
left sides of the closed synthetic joint × 6 trials = 2160 s
of MWH), and the controls samples exposed MWH microwaves or at AT.
Each of the six trials shown is for three different model 3 pseudo-tophus
that were submerged in 800 μL solutions of Au NPs or deionized
water in pseudo-bursa, which were embedded in closed synthetic joints
covered with glass coverslips. Pseudo-tophus were removed from the
pseudo-bursas, dehydrated, and weighed to determine the PMR. Control
samples were exposed to MWH or at AT in the presence of 800 μL
of Au NPs or 800 μL of deionized water for the duration of time
equal to that of the MAMAD sessions. The average PMR after all six
trials (18 MAMAD sessions) for all three pseudo-tophus in the rotated
closed synthetic joint exposed to MWH and Au NPs was 8.00 ± 2.53%.
The pseudo-tophus in the control group in the presence of Au NPs and
at AT (no MWH) in the rotated closed synthetic joint had an average
PMR of 8.63 ± 0.91% after all six trials. We attribute the similar
average PMR observed in control (Au NPs and at AT) and MAMAD sessions
to experimental error, especially considering that the PMR variation
in the MAMAD session is >30% as compared to 11% in the control
experiment.
That is, due to multiple evaporation steps involved in evaluation
of PMR, measurements are more prone to errors, and average PMR appears
to be similar. In addition, there are clear structural differences
in pseudo-tophus observed after these experiments as described in Figure 7, demonstrating the
superiority of MAMAD over using Au NPs alone at AT. The control pseudo-tophus
submerged in deionized water (without Au NPs) in the rotated closed
synthetic joint had an average PMR of 2.84 ± 0.82% after all
six trials. The control pseudo-tophus exposed to MWH and submerged
in deionized water (without Au NPs) in the rotated closed synthetic
joint had an average PMR of 6.58 ± 0.67% after all six trials
(18 MAMAD sessions). Figure S4 shows the
internal temperature changes of the rotated closed joint during exposure
to 18 MAMAD sessions and 1 h of dehydration after every three MAMAD
sessions. The initial temperature range of the rotated closed synthetic
joints was 17–26 °C, and final temperatures remained relatively
constant.

a PMR of three different MSUM pseudo-tophus
that were submerged in 800 μL solutions of Au NPs or deionized
water in pseudo-bursas, which were embedded in closed synthetic joints
covered with glass coverslips, was determined after application of
18 MAMAD sessions (three sessions on the right, top, and left sides
of the closed synthetic joint × 6 trials = 2160 s of MWH) or
at ambient temperature. Pseudo-tophus were removed from the pseudo-bursas,
dehydrated, and weighed to determine the PMR.

Finite-Difference Time-Domain Electromagnetic Simulations of
Synthetic Joint Models
To determine the extent of electric
field distribution throughout the closed synthetic joint models, we
have carried out FDTD simulations. Since open joint synthetic joint
model did not yield favorable results with the MAMAD technique, we
did not carry out FDTD simulations for open joints. FDTD simulations
for closed synthetic joint model predicted that 11.6% of the microwave
radiation was reflected back into the microwave waveguide by the structure,
of which 8.4% is due to the top epidermis/dermis layer (Figure 8). Only 11.4% of the microwave
radiation was transmitted to the pseudo-tophus after being absorbed
by the top epidermis/dermis, subcutaneous, and muscle layers, where
the absorbances of each layer were determined as 61.2, 4.1, and 12.2%,
respectively. The transmitted electric field to the bottom muscle
layer was predicted to be 0.25% after the pseudo-tophus/synovial fluid
structure, which was negligible. These results imply that one can
potentially use a microwave source with power higher than 20 W (which
is the maximum allowed power of microwave source used in this study).
Since no medical microwave device with a microwave applicator used
in this study exists yet, we will revisit the microwave power issue
as these devices become commercially available. We plan to carry out
animal studies to test the applicability of the MAMAD technique, and
these results will be reported in due course.

constants for the components of the synthetic joint model were chosen
to reflect the actual human skin, synovial fluid, and bones. A monomode
microwave point source operating at 8 GHz was used. The left panel

Conclusions
This proof-of-principle study demonstrates
the use of MAMAD technique
for the decrystallization of MSUM crystals in three synthetic joint
models, which is an important step toward the development an alternative
gout treatment based on the MAMAD technique. This paper describes
our findings, the limitations of our studies, the lessons learned
from these studies, and recommendations made where appropriate as
summarized below:(1) In model 1 (closed synthetic joint
with a 1 h dehydration period after each of the seven MAMAD sessions)
pseudo-tophus exposed to MWH in the presence of Au NPs showed a PMR
of 8.3% after a single MAMAD session (120 s), which was a larger decrease
than those observed for the control pseudo-tophus at AT in the presence
or absence of Au NPs (5.4%). Intermittent dehydration of the solvent
to assess the effectiveness of the MAMAD technique for decrystallization
was found to be cumbersome and increased the time of MAMAD sessions.
Thus, we modified our method of assessment of the effectiveness of
decrystallization in models 2 and 3. In these models, we increased
the number of MAMAD sessions and decreased the number of dehydration
steps. The temperature of the synthetic joints was cooled to a temperature
of 17.9 ± 0.4 °C, before the commencement of the MAMAD sessions,
and an increase of 4.8 ± 2.2 °C was observed during the
MAMAD sessions. These observations imply that the combined use of
MWH and Au NPs can decrease the mass of pseudo-tophus in a single
MAMAD session without significantly increasing the temperature of
the synthetic skin. We also determined that a greater volume than
500 μL of the Au NP solution to avoid evaporation of solvent
and keep Au NPs in solution was required. We have previously shown
that the size of the Au NPs can increase PMR (increase in size reduces
stability of Au NPs in solution), and Au NPs remain in solution in
buffer and in synovial fluid during and after microwave heating.21

(2) In model 2 (i.e., closed or open synthetic
joint with a 1 h dehydration period after every seven MAMAD sessions
experiments), a MSUM pseudo-tophus was submerged in an 800 μL
solution of Au NPs or an equal volume of deionized water in a pseudo-bursa
and embedded in a closed joint covered by a synthetic skin patch or
in an open joint covered by a glass coverslip. The closed joint is
the more stringent of the two models, whereby microwave heating must
penetrate the depth of the synthetic skin patch for decrystallization
to occur. The open joint model was used to determine whether the open
joint covered with a glass slide would increase decrystallization.

(a) In model 2,
pseudo-tophus samples
in the closed joint model exposed to seven MAMAD sessions resulted
in a more substantial increase in the average PMR of 11.5 ± 1.82%
when compared to the pseudo-tophus samples in the control experiments
at AT + Au NPs, AT + deionized water, and MWH + deionized water showed
an average PMR of 6.08 ± 0.01, 3.91 ± 0.42, and 5.17 ±
0.91% respectively. The open joint model exposed to seven MAMAD sessions
had an average PMR of 5.89 ±1.59% and when compared to the closed
joint model a difference of 5.61 ± 0.23% was observed. The control
experiments in the open joint at AT + Au NPs, AT + deionized water,
and MWH + deionized water had an average PMR of 2.57 ± 1.12,
5.42 ± 2.43, and 6.07 ± 0.06% respectively.

(b) We also investigated the extent of
damage to synthetic skin caused by MWH and the feasibility of using
a synthetic skin patch to cover the location of pseudo-tophus during
the MAMAD sessions. The integrity of the synthetic skin remained intact
for 78 ± 5.1 s of direct microwave exposure before damage occurred.
The temperature of the synthetic joint remained in a range that did
not exceed AT (0.57 °C was the maximum temperature increase).

(3) In
model 3 (i.e., rotated closed synthetic
joint with 18 MAMAD sessions, a 1 h dehydration period after three
MAMAD sessions, total MWH time = 2160 s). The total exposure of joint:
six MAMAD sessions on the right, left, and top sides of the joint
for the duration of experiments. We investigated the feasibility of
increasing the efficiency of the MAMAD sessions for large tophus by
applying MWH to different sides of the synthetic joint. After a total
of 18 MAMAD sessions, a PMR of 8.00 ± 2.53% was observed, as
compared to a PMR of the control experiments in the closed joint at
AT + Au NPs, AT + deionized water, and MWH + deionized water had an
average PMR of 8.63 ± 0.91, 2.84 ± 0.82, and 6.58 ±
0.67%, respectively. We observed that temperature increases in areas
exposed to MWH were not significant. The results presented herein
are a step closer to the applicability of the MAMAD technique for
a future potential treatment of gout and other crystal deposition
diseases in humans.

All chemicals and reagents
were used as received unless otherwise described. Sodium hydroxide
anhydrous pellets, uric acid powder, chondroitin sulfate, lyophilized
powder bovine serum albumin, and phosphatidylcholine, Au NPs (optical
density: 1.0; diameter: 20 nm; catalog number: 741965; 7.2 ×

WI). Acetic acid was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH).
Coverslips (microslides, thickness: 0.96–1.06 mm), 20 mL scintillation
vials, 150 mL filtration system were obtained from Corning Inc. (Corning,
NY). Glass scintillation vials (20 mL), stir bars, and thermometers
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Polyurethane plastic
pouches were made from 2-mil poly tubing purchased from U-Line (Pleasant
Prairie, WI). Synthetic skin was acquired from SynDaver Labs (Tampa,
FL). The antialgae solution was manufactured by Clorox (Lawrenceville,
GA), and cyanoacrylate was purchased from Gorilla Glue, Inc. (Cincinnati,
OH). Aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized water (>18.0
MΩ
cm resistivity at 25 °C) obtained from a Millipore Direct Q3
system.

MSUM and Pseudo-Tophus Synthesis
Acicular MSUM crystals
used for the synthesis of pseudo-tophus were synthesized according
to the method of Burt et al.22 The method
involved the dissolution of uric acid in deionized water and adjustment
of pH with sodium hydroxide solution and acetic acid. pH and gradual
cooling of the uric acid solution at AT facilitated the formation
of acicular-shaped MSUM crystals, which were harvested and used to
synthesize pseudo-tophus. The pseudo-tophus were synthesized from
a mixture of constituents frequently found in the chalky buildup of
crystals in joints afflicted with gout with the exclusion of macrophages,
mast cells, and other cellular components. Pseudo-tophus were formed
from acicular MSUM crystals (4 g), phosphatidylcholine (1 g), chondroitin
sulfate (1 g), and lyophilized bovine serum albumin (1 g), reconstituted
with 3 mL of deionized water. Premeasured paste-like pseudo-tophus
were dehydrated in 5–15 mm batches on watch glasses at 80 °C
for 20 s. The mass of each synthesized pseudo-tophus was measured
after dehydration (mass range: 100–600 mg) and stored at 25
°C.

Assembly of Synthetic Joint Models
Synthetic skin consisted
of layers analogous to human skin layers (i.e., epidermis, dermis,
subcutaneous layer, and muscle layers) with a thickness that ranged
from 2 to 4 mm. Physicochemical, mechanical, and thermal properties
of the synthetic skin (i.e., surface puncture energy, dielectric properties,
fiber, heat, and porosity) were validated as analogous to human skin
by SynDaver Labs. The synthetic skin was stored in an antialgae solution
(60 mL of the antialgae solution in 4500 mL of deionized water and
refrigerated at 4 °C) to prevent contamination and maintain the
integrity of the synthetic skin. Synthetic skin patches were sized
to fit the bones in the metacarpophalangeal joint of the forefinger.
Cyanoacrylate was used to secure the 3D-printed second metacarpal
and proximal phalange bones to the synthetic skin to form a synthetic
joint with a 2 cm intra-articular space for insertion of pseudo-tophus
in a pseudo-bursa made from 2-mil poly tubing. The synthetic joint
was sutured with a needle and waxed thread and stored at 2 °C.

Decrystallization of a Pseudo-Tophus Embedded in a Synthetic
Joint Using the MAMAD Technique
The synthetic joint was secured
to a Universal Multichannel Instrument Stand (FISO Technologies, Inc.,
Québec, Canada), and a UMI4 fiber optic temperature probe was
inserted into the synthetic joint to measure microwave-induced temperature
changes that occur with the MAMAD technique. The initial temperature
of the synthetic joint was maintained below AT (<20 °C) to
mimic the application of a cold pack to an inflamed joint. Pseudo-tophus
(100–600 mg) in the pseudo-bursa (2 cm × 2.5 cm polyurethane
pouch) containing 20 nm Au NPs was sealed and placed in the synthetic
joint. A microscope camera was situated above the synthetic joint
to capture images for analysis. The synthetic joint was exposed to
a 120 s MAMAD session. The temperature of the synthetic joint with
an embedded pseudo-tophus was continuously monitored with the application
of the MAMAD technique to ensure that the temperature of the synthetic
joint did not exceed the physiological range (36.5–37.5 °C).
The pseudo-bursa was covered with a synthetic skin patch in the closed
joint, and in the open joint, the pseudo-bursa was covered by a glass
coverslip.

Model 1: Application of Seven MAMAD Sessions
in a Closed Synthetic
Joint with a Pseudo-Bursa (Plastic Pouch) Containing a Pseudo-Tophus
Submerged in Au NPs and Dehydrated after Each MAMAD Session
Figure 1 shows the
components used to build the synthetic joint model: synthetic skin,
pseudo-bursa, and 3D-printed bones and pseudo-tophus. During each
MAMAD session, MWH was applied to the synthetic joint with an 8 GHz
medical microwave generator via an applicator tip. The pseudo-tophus
was submerged in 500 μL of 20 nm Au NPs embedded in pseudo-bursa
and placed in a synthetic joint; a 1 cm × 1 cm × 2 cm synthetic
skin patch covered the opening of the joint creating a closed synthetic
joint model. The synthetic joint was exposed to microwaves for four
30 s intervals of MAMAD sessions (120 s). The microwave-exposed synthetic
joints were monitored with an optical microscope camera every 30 s
for 120 s with a 10 s delay. The temperature of the synthetic joint
was monitored throughout the experiment using an interjoint temperature
probe. The pseudo-tophus and Au NPs were removed from the pseudo-bursa
after exposure to the MAMAD technique and dehydrated separately at
80 °C for an hour. Thereafter, the mass of the pseudo-tophus
was measured and recorded, and each session was repeated after 24
h. The damage that occurred to synthetic skin patch during microwave
exposure was assessed after each MAMAD session.

Model 2: Application
of 21 MAMAD Sessions in a Closed or Open
Synthetic Joint with a Pseudo-Bursa Containing a Pseudo-Tophus Submerged
in Au NPs and Dehydrated after Every Seven MAMAD Sessions
The synthetic joint model 2 used in these experiments was similar
to the synthetic joint model 1. In Figure 2, the pseudo-tophus was submerged in 800
μL of 20 nm Au NPs and enclosed in a pseudo-bursa. The pseudo-bursa
was placed in a synthetic joint (open or closed) and exposed to MWH.
The open synthetic joint lacked the 1 cm × 1 cm × 2 cm synthetic
skin patch used to cover the opening of the closed joint. The pseudo-tophus,
enclosed in the pseudo-bursa within the synthetic joint, was exposed
to the MAMAD technique intermittently for seven MAMAD sessions (1
session = 120 s of MWH) without intermittent dehydration for 840 s.
The pseudo-tophus and Au NPs were separated from the pseudo-bursa
after microwave exposure, dehydrated for 1 h at 80 °C, and weighed
for mass loss. The synthetic skin patch, used in the closed joint,
was accessed for microwave-induced damage. In the open synthetic joint,
the pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus was covered by a glass
coverslip. A Phenom XL desktop SEM was used to view the structural
changes on the surface of dehydrated pseudo-tophus samples. SEM was
set to 15 kV, and we obtained SEM images magnifications (at scales
closer to 200, 50, 10, and 2 μm) to characterize structural
damages to the surface of pseudo-tophus.

Model 3: Application of
18 MAMAD Sessions in a Rotated Open
Synthetic Joint (MWH on the Right, Top, and Left Sides) with a Pseudo-Bursa
Containing a Pseudo-Tophus Submerged in Au NPs and Dehydrated after
Every Three MAMAD Sessions
In experiments using synthetic
joint models 1 and 2, microwaves were applied to one specific area
of each synthetic joint, and changes in the mass (i.e., decrystallization)
of the pseudo-tophus were accessed. In experiments using the synthetic
joint model 3, microwave heating was applied to three different areas
of the synthetic joint (i.e., right, top, and left), containing a
pseudo-tophus immersed in 800 μL of 20 nm Au NPs in a pseudo-bursa.
The application of microwaves to the top, right, and left sides of
the synthetic joint (i.e., rotated closed synthetic joint) increased
the likelihood of pseudo-tophus decrystallization by subjecting the
synthetic joint to increased microwave exposure. The interjoint temperature
of the synthetic joint was monitored via an interjoint temperature
probe for the duration of the MAMAD session. Figure 3 shows real-color pictures of the synthetic
joint in sequential order.

Finite-Difference Time-Domain Simulations
Finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic simulations were performed to determine
the percentage of microwave absorption by each layer of the structure
and to visualize the electric field propagation through the structure.
MIT’s open source MEEP FDTD software1 was utilized for the two-dimensional simulations. Dielectric constants
of human tissues at 8 GHz microwave frequency were used in all simulations.2,3 The pseudo-tophus was modeled as a 5 mm diameter round object located
between two cortial bones and embedded in synovial fluid. In the electric
field visualization simulations, 8 GHz microwave radiation was modeled
as a fixed frequency continuous source located on the top part of
the simulation cell. As in the experiments, the microwave radiation
was transmitted to the structure through a 4.5 mm diameter waveguide,
enabling single mode transmission. The field images depicted the propagation
of the microwave radiation through the structure (Figure 7).
