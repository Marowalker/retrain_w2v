Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of
colloidal crystals (CCs) allows
for the fine control of the thickness and architecture of the resulting
crystals. Various methods have been developed for the LBL assembly
of CCs of hard spheres. However, these methods are inapplicable for
microgel CCs owing to the softness and deformability of microgel spheres.
In this study, a method was proposed for the LBL assembly of microgel
CCs. To build the first monolayer, azide-modified microgel spheres
were assembled into a three-dimensional (3D) CC. The first 111 plane
of the 3D CC close to the substrate was then fixed in situ onto the
substrate via photoinitiated alkyne–azide click reaction between
the azide groups on the microgels and the alkyne groups on the substrate
surface. The removal of unbonded particles resulted in a microgel
monolayer with a high degree of order. The second monolayer was assembled
in a similar manner, i.e., a 3D microgel CC was initially assembled
followed by in situ fixation of the first 111 plane of the 3D crystal
with the underlying microgel monolayer by photoinitiated alkyne–azide
click reaction. For this purpose, instead of azide-modified microgel
spheres, alkyne-modified microgel spheres were used for the assembly
of the second layer. Confocal studies confirmed that the second monolayer
was located on top of the first layer. When the lattice constant of
the 3D CC approximated that of the underlying microgel monolayer,
the second monolayer exhibited a high degree of order. Repeating this
process led to alternating deposition of highly ordered monolayers
of azide-modified and alkyne-modified microgels onto the substrate.
Similar to the microgel CCs obtained by the self-assembly of microgel
spheres in bulky dispersions, face-centered cubic and hexagonal-close-packed
structures also coexisted in the LBL-assembled microgel CCs.

Introduction
Colloidal
crystals (CCs) have attracted considerable attention
in recent years because of their potential applications in various
aspects, e.g., as waveguides,1 switchers,2 sensors,3,4 optical filters,5 and templates for macroporous materials.6,7 The CCs are usually assembled from monodispersed hard colloids,
e.g., polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and silica particles.
Numerous techniques, e.g., controlled sedimentation,8 solvent evaporation,9 and convective
self-assembly,10 have also been explored
for the CC assembly. Usually, these methods lead to the formation
of bulky crystals, featuring minimal control over the thickness and
inner crystal structure. To solve this problem, several methods have
been developed for fabricating CCs in a layer-by-layer (LBL) fashion.11−18 For example, Velikov et al.11 fabricated
binary CCs by alternate deposition of close-packed two-dimensional
(2D) crystals of large and small spheres using a controlled drying
process on a vertical substrate. Li et al.17 used poly(dimethylsiloxane) sheets to transfer hexagonal close-packed
(hcp) particle monolayers from preformed CCs and stacked them on the
substrates in a LBL manner. The Langmuir–Blodgett technique
is a more popular method for assembling CCs in a LBL manner.12−18 As an example, Reculusa and Ravaine13 initially assembled silica particles into a well-organized 2D array
at the air–water interface and then transferred them onto solid
substrates using the Langmuir–Blodgett technique. Multilayer
CCs were successfully synthesized by repeating the transfer process.
The LBL assembly of CCs allows for the control of sample thickness
at the layer level.13 Moreover, CCs with
a perfectly defined architecture can be fabricated by successive depositions
of layers of particles with different sizes.14 Particularly, a planar defect can be facilely introduced at a predetermined
position. The resulting CCs with a planar defect are highly desirable
for lasing, sensing, and waveguiding purposes.15,19,20

In addition to hard colloids, CCs
have been assembled from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) microgel, which is a soft
hydrogel microsphere.21−25 Studies revealed that microgel CCs are intrinsically defect-tolerant
because of the soft nature of microgel particles.26 In addition, the stimuli-responsivity of PNIPAM microgel
results in stimuli-responsive CCs. Therefore, microgel CCs feature
important applications for optical switching2 and sensing.27−29 Similar to CCs of hard spheres, microgel CCs with
novel properties may be designed by manipulating the crystal structure
in a designed manner. However, to date, microgel CCs are prepared
by self-assembly of microgel spheres in bulky dispersions;21−23 this process inhibits the manipulation of the crystal structure.

Similar to the CCs of hard colloids, fabricating microgel CCs in
a LBL fashion will allow the control of the architecture of the resulting
crystals. For example, a microgel CC with a planar defect is expected
to be produced via LBL assembly, just like the CCs of hard colloids.14 Because of the stimuli-responsivity of the PNIPAM
microgel, the planar defect is expected to be inducible and erasable
via external stimuli, just like point defect as we demonstrated previously.27 Unfortunately, as microgel particles are highly
soft and deformable, the methods developed for the assembly of 2D
CCs of hard colloids are inapplicable for 2D microgel CCs.30−33 In addition, the LBL stacking methods developed for hard sphere
monolayers, e.g., the Langmuir–Blodgett technique,13 are inapplicable for the stacking of microgel
monolayers. We recently proposed a strategy for fabricating highly
ordered microgel monolayers or 2D microgel CCs; in this strategy,
the microgel spheres are initially assembled into three-diimensional
(3D) CCs followed by in situ fixation of the first 111 plane of the
3D assembly and removal of unbonded microgel spheres.30−33 Taking advantage of the easy assembly of large-area, high-quality
3D microgel CCs,21,22,26,28,34−38 large-area, high-quality 2D microgel CCs can be facilely fabricated.30−33 In the present study, we further proposed that by selecting a suitable
reaction (photoinitiated alkyne–azide click reaction, i.e.,
UV-induced CuAAC reaction39−41) for fixation, a second monolayer
can be assembled on top of the first monolayer. Repeating the alternating
assembly process, multilayer microgel CCs can be fabricated. Hopefully,
the proposed method will pave the way for fabricating microgel CCs
with a defined architecture and novel properties. Note, thin films
were previously fabricated by the LBL deposition of the PNIPAM-based
microgel and polycation.42 However, the
resulting films are not microgel CCs due to the lack of ordered structure
of microgel spheres. Click reactions were also used previously to
synthesize microgel clusters by bonding microgel spheres inside the
microgel CCs.43,44

Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 depicts
the LBL assembly of the microgel spheres into CCs. We initially synthesized
the azide- and alkyne-modified microgels. For this purpose, monodispersed
P(NIPAM-AAc) microgels were synthesized via free-radical precipitation
polymerization. The amount of AAc incorporated into the microgel was
determined to be ∼9.4 mol % by pH titration45 (Figure S1), and this value
was close to the AAc content in the pregel solution. We then coupled
the carboxylic acid groups in the microgels with 11-azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine
or propargylamine under N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) catalysis
to introduce azide or alkyne groups (Scheme 1A). A similar procedure was previously used
to introduce other functional groups, e.g., phenylboronic acids, into
the PNIPAM microgels.46−50 The successful modification of microgels was confirmed by the appearance
of new peaks at 3.77 and 3.56 ppm (−N–CH2–CH2–O–CH2–CH2–O–CH2–CH2–O–CH2–CH2–N3) or 2.73 ppm (−N–CH2–C≡C–H) in the 1H NMR spectra of the corresponding microgels51 (Figure S2). Considering the
remaining amounts of AAc in the microgels, as determined again by
pH titration, ∼47.0 or ∼37.3% of the AAc groups were
coupled with azide or alkyne groups, respectively (Figures S3 and S4).

Scheme 1 LBL Assembly of Microgel CCs
(A) Synthesis of azide- and alkyne-modified
microgels by modifying PNIPAM-co-acrylic acid (P(NIPAM-AAc)) microgel
with azide and alkyne groups and modifying quartz slides with alkyne
groups. (B) Sequential assembly of ordered monolayers of azide- and
alkyne-modified microgels on alkyne-modified quartz slide. Each monolayer
was prepared by initially assembling a 3D CC, performing in situ fixation
of the first 111 plane with the underlying substrate or monolayer
via photoinitiated alkyne–azide click reaction, and removing
the unbonded microgel spheres. (C) Photoinitiated alkyne–azide
click reaction between azide-modified microgel sphere and alkyne-modified
substrate or microgel sphere.

After modification,
the ζ-potential of the microgel decreased
from −8.36 mV to −2.94 and −3.88 mV for the azide-
and alkyne-modified microgels (at 20 °C and pH 4.5), respectively.
However, the microgels remained monodispersed (Figure S5) and thermosensitive. Figure 1 shows the temperature-induced phase transition
of the microgels in water at pH 4.5. This pH is close to the pH of
the concentrated dispersions used for the LBL assembly in the following
experiments. As shown in Figure 1, at low temperatures, the two microgels exhibited
almost the same sizes as when they were prepared by modifying the
same parent P(NIPAM-AAc) microgel. The volume phase transition temperature
of the azide-modified microgel (∼33 °C) was slightly higher
than that of alkyne-modified microgel (30 °C). This result could
be explained by the introduction of hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol)
chains in the azide-modified microgel.

microgels as a function of temperature at a pH of 4.5.

Assembly of the First Layer of Microgel Array
To assemble
the first layer of microgels, the substrates, i.e., quartz slides,
were first treated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to introduce
amine groups, followed by treatment with propargylic acid and EDC
to introduce alkyne groups (Scheme 1A). A concentrated dispersion of azide-modified microgel,
to which photoinitiator I2959 and CuSO4 were added, was
loaded into a cell consisting of a glass slide and an alkyne-modified
quartz slide. As previously reported,26,27,37,38,44 the monodispersed microgel particles in the dispersion gradually
self-assembled into a highly ordered crystalline structure when equilibrated
at room temperature (Figure S6). As a result,
the samples displayed different colors when illuminated with white
light obliquely (Figure S6A).30−33,52 Not only the particles in the
interior region but also those close to the substrate were arranged
into a hexagonally close-packed crystalline array, as revealed by
optical microscopy (Figures S6B and S6C). Actually, the particles close to the substrate formed the first
111 plane of the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of the 3D CC.53 The first layer of the microgel spheres can
be fixed onto the substrate by the irradiation of the samples through
the quartz slide with UV light (Scheme 1B). As shown in Scheme 1C, in the presence of photoinitiator I2959 and CuSO4, alkyne–azide click reaction39−41 occurred between
the alkyne groups on the substrate and azide groups on microgel particles.
As a result, the microgel particles close to the substrate are bound
covalently to it. Removal of unbound microgel particles left a monolayer
of microgel particles on the substrate (Scheme 1B).

As microgel particles were fixed
onto the substrate in situ, it was expected that the ordered crystalline
structure would be maintained. This expectation was confirmed by the
vivid diffraction colors of the resulting monolayer when illuminated
with white light from behind (Figure 2A).30−33 Different parts of the monolayer displayed different colors owing
to the varying angles at which individual parts were illuminated.52,54 The second proof for the ordered structure came from the laser diffraction
experiment (see Figure S7 for the experimental
setup). If the particles were arranged into a perfect hexagonal array,
when illuminated with a monochromatic laser light, the monolayer would
give a diffraction pattern composed of a set of distinct spots with
a 6-fold symmetry.52,55 As expected, the monolayer displayed
a diffraction pattern with six symmetrical spots (Figure 2B), implying that the microgel
particles in the illuminated area (∼2 mm in diameter) were
arranged into a highly ordered hexagonal crystalline array. Direct
evidence for the ordered structure were obtained from the optical
microscopy (Figure 2C) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the monolayer (Figure 2D,E). These images
showed that the microgel spheres were arranged in a hexagonal crystalline
array. The fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of the AFM image, shown
as an inset in Figure 2D, also confirms the structure with a long-range order and a hexagonal
symmetry.56

image (C), and high-magnification (D) and low-magnification AFM images
(E) of a 2D array of azide-modified microgel fabricated on an alkyne-modified
quartz slide. The inset in D shows the FFT of the image.

The order of the monolayer was also characterized
quantitatively
using the dimensionless pair correlation function, g(r), which is defined by the following equation  where a is the shell area
and n(r, r + dr) is the number of particles that lie within the shell
considered.54,57 This function describes the probability
of finding a particle at a distance r from a given
particle in the 2D space. The peaks in the distribution, which indicated
the preferred distances, were considered as signatures of order of
the 2D array. Figure 3 shows the typical g(r) of a microgel
monolayer. For comparison, the g(r) of a perfectly packed hexagonal array was also plotted. The emergence
of a series of peaks indicated the extension of structural order over
a long distance. In addition, the positions of the peaks coincided
with those of the perfectly packed hexagonal array, confirming the
hexagonal packing of the particles.

dashed vertical
lines indicate the peaks of the g(r) of an ideal hexagonally packed monolayer generated
numerically. The inset highlights the centers of the particles as
identified from the automated particle location procedure.

Assembly of the Second Layer of Microgel
Array
After
the first layer of azide-modified microgel was assembled, a second
layer comprising alkyne-modified microgel was assembled on top of
the first one, as shown in Scheme 1B. Similarly, a concentrated dispersion of the alkyne-modified
microgel (with photoinitiator I2959 and CuSO4) was loaded
into a cell consisting of a glass slide and a quartz slide with a
monolayer of azide-modified microgel. After the particles self-assembled
into a crystalline structure, the sample was UV-irradiated to fix
the alkyne-modified microgel particles with the underlying azide-modified
microgel, as a result of the alkyne–azide click reaction between
the alkyne groups on alkyne-modified microgel and azide groups on
azide-modified microgel particles.39−41

The 3D structure
of the resulting two-layer microgel array was studied by confocal
laser scanning microscopy. Before imaging, the first layer (azide-modified
microgel) was selectively labeled with fluorescein by treatment with
FAM alkyne, exploring the copper-catalyzed click reaction between
the azide groups on the microgel particles and alkyne groups on the
dye. The second layer (alkyne-modified microgel) was selectively labeled
with cyanine by treatment with sulfo-cyanine5 azide, also exploring
the same click reaction again but between the alkyne groups on the
microgel particles and the azide groups on the dye in this case. The
sample was then imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy. From Figure 4A,B, a layer of azide-modified
microgel particles, which were stained green with fluorescein, and
a layer of alkyne-modified microgel particles, which were stained
with red sulfo-cyanine, were observed. In both layers, the microgel
particles were arranged in a highly ordered structure. The positions
of the two layers were at z = 3.79 μm (azide-modified
microgel particles) and z = 3.16 μm (alkyne-modified
microgel particles). Figure 4C shows the yz scan image of the sample,
from which the positions of the two layers are clearly visible. Note
the particles are distorted in the image owing to the low resolution
along the Z-axis. Similar phenomena were observed
in previous reports.58,59

of a two-layer microgel
array. The azide-modified microgel spheres were stained green with
fluorescein, (A) whereas the alkyne-modified microgel spheres were
stained red with sulfo-cyanine. (B) The Z step of the images is ∼0.31
μm. (C) A yz scan image. Scale bars: 5 μm.

A control experiment was designed
to further confirm the spatial
relation between the two layers. In this experiment, we used a mixed
dispersion of alkyne-modified microgel spheres and unmodified microgel
spheres (approximately 10% were unmodified) to assemble the second
layer. Similarly, the resulting sample was fluorescently labeled and
then imaged with confocal microscopy. Again, two layers of microgel
spheres, i.e., one layer of azide-modified microgel spheres (stained
green with fluorescein) and another layer of alkyne-modified microgel
spheres (stained red with sulfo-cyanine), were observed. For this
sample, the layer of azide-modified microgel was integral. The microgel
particles were arranged in a highly ordered hexagonal crystalline
array. For the second layer, however, the hexagonal array was incomplete
(Figure 5). The missing
particles should be the unmodified ones that were not bound covalently
to the underlying azide-modified microgel spheres and removed from
the array during washing. The results prove that covalent bonding
between the two layers was critical for the successful assembly of
the second layer. As the layer of alkyne-modified microgel spheres
was incomplete, from the merged image, one can clearly see that the
layer of alkyne-modified microgel spheres resided on top of the layer
of azide-modified microgel spheres (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Confocal microscopy images of a two-layer array
in which the second
layer was assembled using a mixed dispersion of alkyne-modified microgel
spheres and unmodified microgel spheres. The azide-modified microgels
and alkyne-modified microgels were stained green with fluorescein
and red with sulfo-cyanine, respectively. Scale bar: 5 μm.

In the above experiments, the
concentration of the microgel dispersion
for the second layer was carefully adjusted by adding a small amount
of water until the lattice constant of the resulting 3D CC from the
dispersion was close to that of the 3D CC from the microgel dispersion
for the first layer. For a 3D microgel CC, the microgel spheres at
the interface experience a different environment from the ones in
the interior. One may expect that the substrate may influence the
assembly of particles at the interface. If the 3D CC of the alkyne-modified
microgel possessed the same lattice constant with the underlying 2D
CC of azide-modified microgel, then the alkyne-modified microgel spheres
would self-assemble into a crystalline structure using the underlying
layer of alkyne-modified microgel as a template, as shown in Scheme 1B. The presence of
the first layer of microgel (2D CC of azide-modified microgel) would
not interfere with the arrangement of the alkyne-modified microgel
particles, particularly the particles on the interface, into an ordered
crystalline structure. This condition will result in a highly ordered
layer of alkyne-modified microgel on top of the first layer of azide-modified
microgel (Figure 6A).
By contrast, when the 3D CC of the alkyne-modified microgel possesses
a lattice constant smaller (Figure 6B) or larger (Figure 6C) than that of 3D CC of the azide-modified microgel
and hence the underlying 2D CC of azide-modified microgel, a mismatch
would occur between the lattice constants of the 3D CC of the azide-modified
microgel CCs and the underlying 2D microgel CC, resulting in a reduced
degree of order of the second layer of microgel array (Figure 6B,C).

Figure 6 Optical microscopy images
of crystalized dispersions of azide-
and alkyne-modified microgels (3D CCs) and confocal images of the
first layer of azide-modified microgel (stained green with fluorescein)
and the second layer of alkyne-modified microgel (stained red with
sulfo-cyanine). The lattice constant of the 3D CC of azide-modified
microgel is close to (765 vs 730 nm, A), smaller than (765 vs 600
nm, B), or larger than (600 vs 756 nm, C) that of 3D CC of alkyne-modified
microgel. Scale bar: 5 μm.

Assembly of Multilayer CCs
The above study demonstrates
that the ordered monolayers of azide- and alkyne-modified microgels
can be assembled onto quartz slide sequentially. By repeating the
alternating assembly process, multilayer microgel CCs can be assembled.
As a proof, a four-layer CC was assembled. The sample was fluorescently
labeled and imaged with a confocal microscope. As shown in Figure 7A,B, two monolayers
of azide-modified microgel (stained green with fluorescein) were identified
at z = 3.30 and 2.10 μm, respectively. At the
same time, two monolayers of alkyne-modified microgel (stained red
with sulfo-cyanine) were identified at z = 2.70 and
1.50 μm.

Figure 7 (A, B) Cross-sectional confocal images of a four-layer
microgel
array. The azide-modified microgel spheres were stained green with
fluorescein, whereas the alkyne-modified microgel spheres were stained
red with sulfo-cyanine. The Z step of the images is ∼0.30 μm.
Scale bar: 2.5 μm.

Confocal images of the four monolayers were collected (Figure 8A). The FFT of the
images indicates a structure with a long-range order and a hexagonal
symmetry in each layer. To analyze the stacking sequence, the center
of the particles in each layer was extracted and assigned a pseudocolor
of red, green, blue, or magenta (Figure 8B). The images of the three sequential layers
(i.e., 1st, 2nd, and 3rd layers and 2nd, 3rd, and 4th layers) were
then merged, as shown in Figure 8C. In the merged images, if the three colors can be
observed distinctly, then the layers were stacked into an fcc structure.
If two of the colors overlapped with each other, then the layers were
stacked into an hcp structure.56 The merged
images prove that fcc and hcp structures can be identified, thereby
suggesting a random hcp structure in which the fcc structure coexisted
with the hcp structure. Notably, the fcc and hcp structures also coexisted
in the 3D microgel CCs obtained by the commonly used self-assembly
of microgel spheres in bulky dispersions.56,60

layer. The images are assigned a pseudocolor of red, green, blue,
or magenta. (C) Merged images of consecutive three layers. The left
image was obtained from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd layers, whereas the
right one originated from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th layers.

To test whether the microgel CCs were still thermosensitive,
a
four-layer crystal film was soaked in water with pH 4.5, and its absorbance
at 550 nm was traced when the film was heated from 20 to 45 °C.
A sharp increase in absorbance was observed at ∼30 °C,
demonstrating that the film remained thermosensitive (Figure S8). The heat-induced response of the
film was also followed up by confocal microscopy (Figure S9). As the film was covalently attached on a solid
substrate and hence mechanically constrained by the substrate, it
could only shrink along the direction normal to the substrate. As
a result, the in-plane interparticle distance remained unchanged upon
heating. However, the microgel monolayer gradually moved out of the
plane of focus because of the heat-induced shrinkage along the vertical
direction. As a result, the image became blurred and finally disappeared
from the view.

Conclusions
We developed a method
to assemble 3D microgel CCs in a LBL manner.
Each monolayer was assembled by first assembling a 3D microgel CC,
followed by in situ fixation of the first 111 plane of the 3D crystal
with the underlying substrate or microgel monolayer. Photoinitiated
alkyne–azide click reaction was selected for fixation. Using
this method, monolayers of azide- and alkyne-modified microgels were
alternately assembled onto the substrate. Each monolayer exhibited
a high degree of order owing to the high quality of the parent 3D
microgel CCs and high efficiency of the photoinitiated alkyne–azide
click reaction. The LBL assembly of CCs allowed control of the thickness
and architecture of the resulting crystals. The method developed in
this study will pave the way for designing and assembling microgel
CCs with defined architectures and novel properties.

Experimental
Details
Materials
NIPAM, propargylamine hydrochloride, and
11-azide-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine were purchased from Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co. N,N′-Methylenebis(acrylamide)
(BIS) was purchased from Alfa Asear. I2959 was purchased from Tianjin
Heowns Biochem LLC. The fluorescent dyes, i.e., FAM alkyne, 5-isomer,
and sulfo-cyanine5 azide, were purchased from Lumiprobe. AAc, potassium
persulfate (KPS), EDC, propargylic acid, CuSO4·5H2O, and APTES were purchased from local providers. NIPAM was
purified by recrystallization from hexane/acetone mixture and dried
in a vacuum. AAc was distilled under reduced pressure. Other reagents
were used as received.

Synthesis of P(NIPAM-AAc) Copolymer Microgel
P(NIPAM-AAc)
microgels were synthesized by free-radical precipitation polymerization.
Initially, 1.414 g of NIPAM, 0.1 g of AAc, and 0.0334 g of BIS (molar
ratio of NIPAM, AAc, and BIS was 90:10:1.5, respectively) were dissolved
in 95 mL of water. The solution was then transferred to a three-necked
round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser and a nitrogen line,
purged with nitrogen, and heated to 70 °C. After 1 h, 5 mL of
0.06 mol/L KPS was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was
allowed to proceed at 70 °C for 4 h. The resultant microgel dispersion
was purified by dialysis against water with frequent water change
for at least 1 week.

Synthesis of Azide- and Alkyne-Modified Microgels
To
synthesize azide-modified microgel, 0.6 g of 11-azide-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine
and 0.7 g of EDC were added to 50 mL of purified P(NIPAM-AAc) microgel
dispersion. The reaction mixture was constantly stirred at 4 °C
for 4 h. The resultant products were purified by dialysis against
water with frequent water change for 1 day.

To synthesize alkyne-modified
microgel, 0.3 g of propargylamine hydrochloride and 0.65 g of EDC
were added to 50 mL of purified P(NIPAM-AAc) microgel dispersion.
The reaction mixture was constantly stirred at 4 °C for 4 h.
The resultant products were purified by dialysis against water with
frequent water change for 1 day.

Assembly of the First Layer
of Microgel Array
The microgel
array was assembled using quartz slide as substrate. Prior to use,
the slides were initially cleaned in boiling piranha solution (3:7
v/v H2O2–H2SO4 mixture)
(caution: this solution is extremely corrosive) for 4 h, rinsed thoroughly
with deionized water, and finally dried. Then, the slides were immersed
in 1 wt % anhydrous toluene solution of APTES for 4 h, sonicated twice
in toluene for 10 min each, and finally dried. To introduce alkyne
groups, 0.9 g of EDC and 0.1 g of propargylic acid were dissolved
in 50 mL of water and allowed to react for 30 min. Then, the amino-functionalized
quartz slides were immersed in the solution for 12 h. After rinsing
with deionized water, the quartz slides were dried.

The azide-modified
microgel dispersions were concentrated by centrifugation. A total
of 5 μL of 30% I2959 (w/v) in DMSO and 5 μL of 10% CuSO4·5H2O were added to 1.0 mL of the concentrated
dispersion. The mixture was then injected into cells composed of a
glass slide and an alkyne-modified quartz slide separated by two layers
of parafilm. The dispersions were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature
for at least 1 day to allow the microgel particles to self-assemble
into 3D CCs. Then, the crystallized samples were irradiated with UV
light (>340 nm) for 60 s using an Intelli-Ray 400 W curing system.
The reaction cell was then opened. The microgel spheres that were
not covalently bonded with the substrate were removed by thoroughly
washing the quartz slide with water.

Assembly of the Second
Layer of Microgel Array
To assemble
the second layer, the dispersion of the alkyne-modified microgel was
concentrated by centrifugation to a concentration close to that of
the concentrated dispersion of the azide-modified microgel used for
the assembly of the first monolayer (examined by comparing the lattice
constants of the crystalized samples). A total of 5 μL of 30%
I2959 (w/v) in DMSO and 5 μL of 10% CuSO4·5H2O were added to 1.0 mL of the concentrated dispersion. The
mixture was then injected into a cell composed of a glass slide and
a quartz slide, onto which a layer of azide-modified microgel had
been assembled. After the particles were assembled into a crystalline
structure, the samples were irradiated with UV light. The reaction
cell was then opened. Similarly, the microgel spheres that were not
covalently bonded with the substrate were removed by thoroughly washing
the quartz slide with water.

Confocal Imaging
Prior to imaging,
the samples were
initially fluorescently stained. The azide- and alkyne-modified microgel
spheres in the samples were selectively labeled with FAM alkyne (5-isomer)
and sulfo-cyanine5 azide fluorescence dye, respectively, using copper-catalyzed
azide–alkyne click reaction.61 Initially,
stock solutions of the dyes with a concentration of 1 mg/mL were prepared
using a mixed solvent (9:1 v/v deionized water–DMSO mixture).
Then, a mixed solution containing ∼1 × 10–3 mg/mL FAM alkyne (5-isomer), 1.3 mg/mL CuSO4·5H2O, and 1.7 mg/mL l-ascorbic acid was prepared. The
samples were immersed in the solution at room temperature for 15 h.
After thoroughly rinsing with water, the samples were immersed in
a solution containing ∼5 × 10–3 mg/mL
sulfo-cyanine5 azide, 1.3 mg/mL CuSO4·5H2O, and 1.7 mg/mL l-ascorbic acid at room temperature for
15 h. The samples were finally rinsed thoroughly with water.

After fluorescent labeling, the 3D structure of the samples was imaged
using a Nikon A1+ laser scanning confocal microscope. All images were
obtained with a 100× objective (oil immersion). The FAM dye and
sulfo-cyanine5 dye were excited with 488 and 647 nm laser, respectively.
The Z-series of the images were acquired to determine the spatial
relationship of the particles. Fluorescence was collected separately
but simultaneously using two different channels.

Other Characterizations
The size and size distribution
of the microgel particles were measured by dynamic light scattering
with a Brookhaven 90Plus laser particle size analyzer. All measurements
were conducted at a scattering angle of 90°. The ζ-potential
was measured on a ZetaPALS Potential Analyzer. The 1H NMR
spectra were recorded on a Varian UNITY-plus 400 NMR spectrometer
using D2O as solvent. The AFM images were obtained using
a Benyuan CSPM5000s scanning probe microscope in tapping mode.
