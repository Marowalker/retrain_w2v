Most studies on the weathering of
mine waste rock focus on the
generation of acidic drainage with high metal concentrations, whereas
metal(loid) release under neutral-rock drainage (NRD) conditions has
received limited attention. Here, we present geochemical and mineralogical
data from a long-term (>10 years) kinetic testing program with
50
waste-rock field barrels at the polymetallic Antamina mine in Peru.
The weathering of most rock lithologies in the field experiments generated
circumneutral to alkaline drainage (6 < pH < 9) but with concentrations
of the oxyanion-forming metal(loid)s As, Mo, Se, and Sb in the mg/L
range. The mobilization of As and Sb was particularly efficient from
intrusive, marble and hornfels rocks that contained labile As- and
Sb-sulfides, irrespective of bulk elemental content or waste-rock
reactivity. High-alkalinity drainage from these materials sustained
neutral-pH conditions that are unfavorable to oxyanion adsorption
onto Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides and, therefore, enhanced As and Sb leaching.
The release of Mo and Se from sulfidic skarn and intrusive waste rock
was more proportional to elemental content but equally enhanced by
pH-inhibited adsorption and negligible secondary mineral precipitation
under NRD conditions. Our results demonstrate that oxyanion concentrations
of environmental concern may be conveyed by neutral- to alkaline-pH
waste-rock drainage and should be a focus of mine wastewater monitoring
programs.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
extraction of mineral ores and coal often produces large amounts
of uneconomic sulfidic waste rock that, once exposed to atmospheric
conditions, is prone to enhanced infiltration of precipitation (percolation/draining)
and weathering (oxidation).1−3 The environmental risks associated
with the weathering of sulfidic waste rock have been acknowledged
for decades: a well-known example, acid rock drainage (ARD), entails
the release of poor-quality (i.e., acidic and sulfate-/metal-laden)
effluent that can have severe environmental impacts.2−4 The pH of waste-rock drainage is ultimately governed by the rate
of acid production from sulfide oxidation relative to the rate of
acid neutralization from carbonate or silicate dissolution.1,5,6 Simplified, oxidation of sulfide-rich
or carbonate-poor waste rock may produce low-quality drainage in which
acidic conditions enhance the mobility of metals like Fe, Cu, and
Zn, whereas weathering of high-carbonate rock may produce drainage
that remains circumneutral for years or indefinitely, with substantially
lower metal concentrations. However, neutral-rock drainage (NRD) can
be of low quality too,7−9 e.g., when it contains elevated levels of ecotoxicologically
relevant metals, organic compounds, or suspended particles that are
mobile and bioavailable under circumneutral conditions. Despite a
growing awareness of these potential detrimental environmental impacts,
the current understanding and field-verification of the processes
underlying NRD quality are limited compared to that of ARD: there
is no standardized definition of NRD, and predictive models for managing
NRD in practice remain barely developed to date.5,10

In the context of mine wastes, various oxyanion-forming elements
other than S may exhibit environmental mobility under circumneutral
drainage conditions: examples include the trace elements As, Mo, Sb,
and Se.11−15 The biogeochemistries of these elements are not the same but comparable
in the sense that (i) oxyanionic species dominate their aqueous speciation
under oxic and circumneutral conditions (i.e., arsenate, molybdate,
antimonate, and selenate),16 (ii) they
can be incorporated in variably soluble thio-anionic species,11,17 and (iii) they are prone to methylation (except Mo).18,19 Typical concentrations of these elements in natural freshwaters
are in the range of 10 μg/L and less; however, their concentrations
in mine waste-rock drainage can reach several hundred μg/L or
more.11,12,20,21 At these elevated concentrations, detrimental eco-toxicological
effects can occur, including the bioaccumulation of As and Se that
can induce cellular damage in microbiota resulting from enzyme denaturation
and alteration of gene regulation.11,20,21 At elevated levels, As, Se, Sb, and Mo are also toxic
to humans.64−66 To prevent such detrimental environmental effects,
the processes controlling oxyanion concentrations in mine drainage
need to be understood. Although selected studies have investigated
the occurrence, (bio)geochemical dynamics, and toxicity of As, Mo,
Sb, and Se in mine wastes (e.g., for As,22−25 Mo,14,26,27 Sb,28,29 and Se30−32), the majority of these laboratory and field studies has focused
on their behavior under acidic conditions, with relatively little
attention given to neutral- or alkaline-pH waters (e.g., for As15,33). Therefore, the potential sources and environmental fates of these
elements in NRD systems remain poorly explored.

The concentrations
of As, Mo, Sb, and Se in neutral drainage are
ultimately governed by the interplay of release and retention processes,
e.g., host mineral oxidation and dissolution versus secondary mineral
precipitation, sorption, or biological uptake.34,35 Major primary mineral hosts in sulfidic waste rock may include,
for As: arsenopyrite [FeAsS], enargite [Cu3AsS4], orpiment [As2S3], or realgar [AsS/As4S4],36 for Mo: molybdenite
[MoS2],27 for Sb: tetrahedrite
[(Fe,Zn,Cu,Ag)12Sb4S13], stibnite
[Sb2S3], and other Sb-sulfosalts,37 and for Se: mainly isomorphic substitutions
for sulfide in sulfidic minerals (e.g., selenopyrite) where pure selenide
minerals are known but rare.30 Once dissolved,
As, Mo, Sb, and Se may co-precipitate in the form of solid solutions
as secondary (oxyhydr)oxides and (hydroxy)sulfates or form discrete
secondary mineral phases, both of which provide attenuation mechanisms
in mine wastes.30,38−40 Examples of
identified secondary phases in mine wastes include, for As: various
Ca- and Fe-arsenates (e.g., scorodite [FeAsO4·2H2O]8,36,41), for Mo:
powellite [CaMoO4], wulfenite [PbMoO4], and
ferrimolybdite [Fe2(MoO4)3],13,27,42 and for Sb: stibiconite [Sb3O6(OH)] and kermesite [Sb2S2O].37 To the authors’ knowledge,
no discrete secondary Se phases have been characterized in mine wastes,
even though various metal–selenites are quite insoluble.11,43,44 In addition, dissolved oxyanionic
As, Mo, Sb, and Se species may interact with mineral surfaces: selenate
and molybdate dominate the aqueous Se and Mo speciation in oxic and
circumneutral to alkaline waters and poorly adsorb onto hydrous oxide
or clay surfaces,11,20,45 whereas arsenate and antimonate may be more effectively retained
under such conditions.46,47 The above-mentioned (co-)precipitation
and adsorption processes are highly redox- and pH-sensitive, and the
mutual controls of primary release and secondary retention mechanisms
on drainage quality will, thus, be greatly influenced by spatiotemporal
dynamics in the local drainage chemistry.16 Therefore, the impacts of oxyanion release and retention on mine
drainage quality are ideally studied on a site-specific basis, accounting
for variability in waste-rock properties.

To that end, we studied
the mobilization of oxyanion-forming elements
from a variety of waste-rock lithologies (i.e., non-acid-generating
(NAG) versus acid-generating (PAG) materials) under NRD and ARD conditions.
Using long-term field-barrel experiments, detailed geochemical and
mineralogical analyses, and chemical-equilibrium modeling, we examine
(i) the mineralogical sources of these elements and (ii) the geochemical
processes controlling their mobility in circumneutral drainage.

2 Methods and Materials
2.1 Site Description and Waste-Rock
Sampling
The Antamina mine is located in the Peruvian Andes
(9°32′S–77°03′W)
at an elevation of 4200 m.a.s.l.48 The
mine mainly extracts Cu, Zn, and Mo from a Miocene skarn ore body
that is hosted in Cretaceous carbonate-rich formations, which provide
abundant natural neutralization capacity.48 A distinctive feature of the waste rock generated at Antamina is
its heterogeneity, spanning a wide range of lithologies including
quartz monzonite intrusives, green and brown garnet endoskarns and
exoskarns, hornfels, marbles, and limestones.2 Waste rock at Antamina is processed based on a reactivity classification
scheme that accounts for sulfide and metal content, among others,
and stored on-site in different waste-rock storage facilities that
drain into an isolated tailings facility. Mine wastewater is continuously
monitored and treated prior to release from the site: cause–effect
relationships between the geological setting and mining activities
versus water quality in the downstream catchment area are topic of
ongoing study.67

To represent the
full range of waste rock produced by the mine, 49 different samples
from 5 main rock types (and 1 pure silica-sand blank) were subjected
to static testing as well as kinetic testing using field-barrel experiments
(Table S1): 12 intrusive rocks (field barrels
I1–I12), 11 skarn rocks (field barrels S1–S11), 14 hornfels
rocks (field barrels H1–H14), and 12 marble rocks (field barrels
M1–M12) were investigated. Waste rock was collected from separated
stockpiles directly after being blasted from the open pit. Samples
were carefully homogenized, and the sample size reduced using the
coning and quartering method until representative portions of ∼2000
kg were obtained. These portions were flattened on a clean area, and
fragments >20 cm were removed. Finally, a representative total
of
∼350 kg material was taken from random locations of the portion,
again homogenized, and stored in closed plastic bags for <1 year
prior to use in the field-barrel experiments.

2.2 Kinetic
Testing using Field-Barrel Experiments
The first field-barrel
experiments were established in 2002, and
most have been running for >10 year. Field barrels were constructed
from 55-gallon (∼208 L) open-top poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)
drums equipped with silicone-sealed PVC outlets and drainage tubes
at the bottom (Figure 1a). A ∼10 cm layer of #30 silica sand wrapped in geotextile
membrane was placed at the bottom of each barrel to prevent waste
rock from flushing out of the field barrel. The barrels were placed
on a terraced surface, slightly tilted toward their outlet and filled
with ∼350 kg prehomogenized material using a 25 kg spring scale
(Table S1). Precipitation was allowed to
percolate the waste rock through the open-top barrels at relatively
moderate rates (<1 L/d in the wet season): there were no indications
of waste rock migration within the field barrels during the weathering
experiments. Drainage flow was monitored, and drainage samples collected
at least monthly, in precleaned 20 L HDPE bottles and buckets that
were connected to the barrel outlets and covered to avoid contamination
(Figure 1a).

the experimental field-barrel set-up used for kinetic
testing (a) and an overview of the bulk geochemical characteristics
of the waste rock used in the field-barrel experiments (b). For (b),
properties measured for the unweathered waste rock were averaged per
lithology class (legend in the right applies to all frames), and error
bars indicate standard deviations. Note the logarithmic y-axis for the neutralization potential ratio (NPR; defined as acid-neutralization
potential/acid-production potential).

2.3 Analyses of the Waste-Rock Geochemistry and
Mineralogy
Representative subsamples (∼2 kg) of the
prehomogenized waste rock used in each field barrel were segregated
prior to kinetic testing and characterized by external laboratories
(CMA and EnviroLab, Lima, Peru; and CEMI and ASL, Vancouver, Canada).
Laboratory static testing followed the procedures recommended in the
Mine Environment Neutral Drainage (MEND) program report 5.10E.49 In summary, all waste-rock samples were analyzed
for the following bulk geochemical and physical parameters: acid–base
accounting using the modified Sobek method (including sulfide-S, carbonate-neutralization
potential, and siderite correction10,50), elemental
composition using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) or digestion
in a strong four-acid mixture followed by inductively coupled-plasma
mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis, bulk mineralogy using X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and particle size distribution using sieve analysis. Details
of these analytical methods have been described previously.2,51,52 Detection limits for solid-phase
elemental content measurements were typically <2 mg/kg; for bulk
mineralogy analyses, <0.1 wt %. A summary of the geochemical characteristics
of the initial, unweathered waste rock is given in Figure 1b; detailed waste-rock properties
are given in Table S1 (bulk elemental content), Table S2 (bulk mineralogy), and Figure S1 (particle size distributions).

The mineralogy
of a selection of weathered waste-rock samples was further examined
using automated quantitative mineralogy. Grab samples of weathered
(prehomogenized) waste rock were collected after 10 years from the
top 10 cm of selected decommissioned field barrels. The grab samples
were sieved to <2 mm to isolate the reactive fraction,49 mounted with epoxy resin, and polished on circle
mounts or as thin sections using a nonaqueous cooling lubricant to
minimize phase alteration caused by dissolution and/or heat. A Thermo-Fisher
Mineral Liberation Analyzer (MLA), consisting of an FEI Quanta 600
scanning electron microscope (SEM), a dual Bruker-AXS silicon-drift
energy dispersive X-ray analysis system (EDS), and the MLA Image Processing
software, was used to identify mineral phases in particles with an
area >4 μm2 in the extended backscatter electron
mode. Full instrumental details are given elsewhere.53 Mineralogical associations for As, Mo, Sb, and Se were
unevenly distributed over the size fractions, but the overall agreement
between the modal abundance of mineral phases and the MLA-calculated
elemental assay (reconciled with bulk XRF data51,53) suggested negligible distortion from so-called nugget effects.

2.4 Drainage Chemistry Analyses
Drainage
samples were collected and analyzed on average once every month; provided
that enough precipitation percolated through the barrels. Drainage
pH, temperature, and specific conductivity were measured on-site using
a multimeter (WTW, model 340i). Aliquots of drainage samples were
filtered with 0.45 μm cellulose–acetate filters, acidified
with HNO3, and refrigerated in the dark until further analysis
by above-mentioned commercial laboratories. Alkalinity was measured
in the field by titrating a filtered but nonacidified aliquot with
dilute 0.16 N H2SO4 using a Hach digital titrator.
Concentrations of dissolved major- and trace elements were quantified
using ICP-optical-emission spectroscopy and ICP-MS. Quality control
other than the commercial laboratories’ standards consisted
of analyses of systematic blank and duplicate samples and cross-verification
between laboratories. All collected data were processed and analyzed
using the JMP software (SAS). For data evaluation, elemental aqueous
concentrations below their respective detection limits (summarized
in Table S5) were set to half that limit.
Finally, the aqueous speciation of the studied oxyanions and their
surface interaction with hydrous Fe-oxide was examined with chemical
equilibrium models in PHREEQC using the MINTEQ.v4 database. Details
thereof are given in the Supporting Information.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Waste-Rock
Characteristics
The unweathered
waste rock (isolated prior to initiation of the field barrel weathering
experiments) was highly variable in terms of particle size (Figure S1), bulk elemental content (Figure 1b, Table S1), and bulk mineralogy (Table S2). Although there was considerable variation in the waste-rock
properties within the four lithological rock types, reactive waste-rock
samples (intrusive, skarn) generally exhibited low neutralization
potential ratios (NPR), elevated sulfide content (>3% on average),
and low carbonate content (Table S1). The
mineralogical assemblage of the waste rock corroborated these results,
showing abundant sulfides (e.g., pyrite/pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite,
and sphalerite) and negligible carbonates (e.g., calcite and siderite)
in those samples (Table S2). In contrast,
samples of less-reactive waste-rock (hornfels, marbles) exhibited
generally higher NPR values (>10), higher carbonate content (>5%
on
average), and lower sulfide levels (<1%; Table S1), which was similarly corroborated by their bulk mineral
composition (Table S2).

In terms
of the initial solid-phase As, Mo, Sb, and Se content of the studied
waste rock, variations within and between the various lithologies
were equally appreciable. Interestingly, as concentrations were relatively
comparable between all waste-rock types (averaging around 100 mg/kg
As), with outliers >200 mg/kg as occurring in all lithological
classes
(Table S1). In contrast, solid-phase concentrations
of Mo, Se, and Sb (<150, <5, and <10 mg/kg, respectively,
averaged over all investigated samples) were generally higher in the
skarn material compared to the other lithology classes, although intrusive
waste rock also contained significant Mo levels (Figure 1b; Table S1). Solid-phase elemental contents of Sb and Se were about
an order of magnitude lower than those of As and Mo and oftentimes
below their analytical detection limit (2 mg/kg), in line with their
lower natural abundance. Due to the detection limits of the bulk XRD
analyses (∼0.1 wt %), elevated As, Mo, Se, or Sb contents in
the “fresh” or relatively unweathered waste-rock samples
could be poorly related to discrete mineral phases: detailed and more
sensitive MLA analyses were performed on weathered waste-rock samples
only (see below). Similarly, bulk elemental distributions or mineral
assemblages of the unweathered waste rock seemed largely unrelated
to particle size distributions (Figure S1).

The recorded waste-rock properties are in line with previous
results
from work conducted at the Antamina mine site: they confirm that some
of the highly variable rock types may be potentially acid generating
and show that elevated trace element levels can occur in various waste-rock
types.2,52−54,63 Overall, solid-phase concentrations of As, Mo, Se, and Sb in the
Antamina waste rock were elevated compared to natural backgrounds
but not exceptional compared to previously recorded levels at other
mine sites, i.e., compared to >10 000 mg/kg As in other
tailings
and waste rock21,24 or Mo levels >1000 mg/kg in
other
tailings68 and waste rock.69

3.2 Long-Term Evolution of
Drainage Quality
Drainage quality from the field barrels
varied highly among the
studied waste-rock types (Figure 2). Overall, drainage from NAG waste rock such as marble
and hornfels with NPR > 10 (Figure 1b) remained circumneutral to slightly alkaline (pH
6–9) for the >10 years studied, with sulfate concentrations
in the range of a few tens to a few hundred mg/L (Figure 2). In contrast, weathering
of PAG intrusive and skarn waste rock with NPR < 5 (Figure 1b) produced lower pH drainage
(4 < pH < 6) with sulfate concentrations of up to several g/L.
In a minority of field barrels bearing intrusive PAG waste rock with
NPR < 1 (3 out of 49 barrels), drainage pH values reached pH <
3 after 5–10 years (Figure 2). The observed release of elevated sulfate and metals
such as Fe, Cu, or Zn (concentrations >100 mg/L; Figure S2) from PAG compared to NAG waste rock (concentrations
<1 mg/L) aligns with previous research at Antamina2,52,54,55 and the general notion that weathering of predominantly high-sulfide,
low-carbonate waste rock can generate acidic drainage conditions that
mobilizes sulfate and metals at high levels.1,5

Figure 2 Long-term
evolution of the drainage chemistry from the field-barrel
kinetic tests with various types of waste rock. In total, 5518 drainage
samples from 49 field barrels were collected and analyzed over the
experimental duration (horizontal axes); measurements are here aggregated
per rock type (intrusive, skarn, hornfels, marble; see Figure 1b). Additional elements measured
in the field-barrel drainage are plotted in Figures S2 and S3; detection limits for the drainage chemistry analyses
are provided in Table S5. The distinct
seasonality is typical for the Antamina mine site2,52,54 and results from drying of the waste rock
toward the end of the dry season (no flow and drainage quality measurements)
and flushing of previously oxidized material at the onset of the wet
season. Note that sulfate and Se are plotted on logarithmic vertical
axes.

Although the most elevated sulfate
loads were restricted to low-pH
drainage from PAG rock, appreciable As, Mo, Sb, and Se concentrations
were also observed in circumneutral to slightly alkaline drainage,
produced by both NAG and PAG waste rock (Figure 2; additional oxyanion-forming elements V,
W, Cr, and B in Figure S3). For instance,
elevated As concentrations were observed in drainage from marble (up
to 10 mg/L) and hornfels waste rocks (>20 mg/L) as well as from
intrusive
material (>20 mg/L; Figure 2). Similarly, aqueous Mo concentrations exceeding 10 mg/L
were observed in drainage from both skarn and intrusive waste rock.
Although Sb and Se concentrations were generally lower (<1 and
<0.1 mg/L, respectively) than those of As and Mo, they too reached
up to (several) hundred μg/L in drainage from hornfels and skarn
materials (Figure 2). Bivariate plots of waste-rock drainage pH against aqueous oxyanion
concentrations (Figure 3) provide another means to illustrate As, Mo, Sb, and Se mobilization
from the different waste-rock types: elevated concentrations were
consistently observed in circumneutral to slightly alkaline drainage
from NAG waste rock. In addition, acidic drainage conditions produced
from PAG waste rock (intrusive field barrels I6 and I9) also led to
enhanced oxyanion release.

Figure 3 Bivariate plots of drainage pH versus aqueous
As, Mo, Sb, and Se
concentrations. Drainage chemistry measurements are grouped per waste-rock
type (intrusive, skarn, hornfels, marble; similar to Figure 2), and a selection of field
barrels that yielded elevated drainage concentrations is highlighted
in each frame. Best analytical detection limits; see Methods and Materials section and Table S5) for the respective elements are indicated by the arrows;
additional horizontal clustering arises from the continuous improvement
of detection limits during the long-term monitoring program. The bottom
legend applies to all frames.

Although the field-barrel experiments were started at different
dates (i.e., no more than 2 years apart), the timing of elevated As,
Mo, Sb, and Se release from the different waste rocks often varied
with several years, suggesting a distinct reactivity of the elements
between the various waste-rock types. For instance, increasing As
concentrations in drainage from marble waste rock were observed as
early as 2004, whereas elevated As concentrations in hornfels drainage
were not observed until 2009, and from intrusives not until late 2012,
coincident with the transitioning of intrusive drainage to ARD conditions
(Figure 2). The long-term
release pattern of Sb mimicked that of As, relating to their comparable
chemistry (both group 15 elements). The release trends of Mo and Se
generally fluctuated less than As and Sb but similarly showed concentrations
spiked at different times from the various waste-rock types (Figure 2). These distinct
long-term elemental release patterns are at least partially related
to variable weathering rates in the four waste rock types, resulting
from factors such as particle size, mineralogy, or NP depletion rates.2 However, variable lag times to mobilization from
otherwise comparable waste-rock types may also suggest distinct mineral
host phases and/or variable retention mechanisms controlling the timing
of oxyanion release (Figure 1b, Tables S1 and S2). The latter
is corroborated by multivariate regression analysis of the aqueous
drainage chemistries (Table S3, selected
examples in Figure S4): significant elemental
correlations mostly pertain to individual field barrels and can hardly
be generalized across waste rock of similar lithology.

Compared
to the experiments conducted at Antamina, similar or higher
As, Sb, and Mo concentrations have been detected in drainage from
mine wastes at other sites (as previously reviewed12,20,21): examples include the iron mountain mine
(up to 850 mg/L As under extremely acidic conditions4), the Xikuangshan mine (up to 40 mg/L Sb56), or the San Telmo mine (up to 10 mg/L Mo in hyperacidic
drainage57). Selenium drainage concentrations
recorded in this study (typically <100 μg/L) are comparable
to Se levels observed in other mining regions, e.g., in coal-mine
drainages in the Elk Valley region,30 in
former phosphate-mine drainage in southeastern Idaho70 or at the Fort Knox- and Red Dog mine sites.58 Taken together, the long-term monitoring of
field-barrel experiments shows that As, Sb, and Mo concentrations
under NRD and ARD conditions can be substantially elevated compared
to natural waters and regulatory guidelines.20,21 Therefore, ecotoxicological considerations and adaptations to waste-rock
classification schemes may be required when elevated concentrations
are encountered at mine sites: substantial loadings of the metal(loid)
oxyanions studied here can be produced through weathering of NAG material
that might otherwise be considered less geochemically reactive.

3.3 Disproportionality between Solid-Phase and
Drainage Concentrations
Elemental concentration ratios between
the drainage water and the initial waste rock are calculated for As,
Mo, Se, and Sb for each field barrel (Table S6) and show significant differences in the mobilization behavior of
the studied oxyanion-forming elements and between waste-rock types.
For instance, a disproportionality is observed for As and Sb when
considering solid-phase and average drainage concentrations in the
individual field-barrel experiments: aqueous As concentrations were
elevated in the slightly alkaline drainage (6.5 > pH > 10) from
field
barrels H11, H14 (>20 mg/L) and M2 and M4 (up to 10 mg/L) and in
acidic
drainage (pH < 3) from field barrel I9 (>25 mg/L; Figure 3). In comparison, solid-phase
As was elevated in the waste rock of field barrel I9 (up to 228 mg/kg),
but waste rock in the other barrels contained less As (all <130
mg/kg, Table S1), and waste rock with the
highest As content in this study (up to 1050 mg/kg; barrel S10) did
not yield correspondingly elevated drainage concentrations (<100
μg/L). Similarly, slightly alkaline drainage from field barrels
H11 and H14 contained >1 mg/L Sb (Figure 3), whereas none of these rocks had exceptionally
high Sb content (i.e., all <15 mg/kg; Table S1), and the most Sb-rich waste rock (field barrel S10; >135
mg/kg) did not induce high Sb drainage (<20 μg/L).

For Mo and Se, the agreement between drainage concentrations and
bulk elemental grades was better. The highest Mo drainage concentrations
were observed from skarn waste rock (>10 mg/L in circumneutral
to
slightly alkaline drainage from barrels I1, I8, S1 and S2) and intrusive
waste rock (>1 mg/L Mo in acidic drainage from barrel I9; Figure 3). All of these barrels
had >200 mg/kg Mo in their waste rock, i.e., 50 times more than
average
Mo levels in the hornfels and marble materials (Figure 1b). Selenium was not abundant in any of the
investigated waste rock (<10 mg/kg in intrusive, hornfels and marble
materials; Table S1), but skarn rocks had
higher Se (∼14 mg/kg on average) than other waste-rock types,
and drainage concentrations from these barrels were correspondingly
higher. For instance, Se drainage concentrations were >100 μg/L
for barrel S10 under NRD conditions or for barrels I6 and I9 under
ARD conditions (Figure 3). In summary, elevated concentrations of As, Mo, Se, and Sb occur
under NRD as well as ARD conditions, but the release of As and Sb
(and to a lesser extent Mo and Se) often appears in disconnect with
their elemental content. This discrepancy suggests discrete sourcing
from primary mineral hosts and/or specific attenuation mechanisms
(e.g., secondary mineral formation and/or sorption), which are considered
below.

3.4 Primary and Secondary Mineralogy of As, Sb,
Mo, and Se
Quantitative mineralogical analysis of a selection
of weathered waste-rock samples provided a “snapshot”
of the mineralogical host phases of the studied trace elements.

3.4.1 Arsenic and Antimony
In all waste-rock
types, As and Sb were associated with distinct primary sulfide minerals
(Table 1). Arsenopyrite
and scorodite were not detected in significant amounts in the investigated
waste-rock samples, although arsenopyrite has been shown to occur
at Antamina, and both minerals are commonly identified in other As-rich
mine sites.36,51 Instead, the most abundant As-bearing
sulfides were Cu–As–sulfides, such as watanabeneite,
enargite, and tennantite (together totaling up to 49 wt % of the solid-phase
As; Table 1), which
corroborates previous observations at Antamina and at other Cu-rich
deposits.36 The marble and hornfels waste
rock in field barrels M7 and H14 had minor fractions of As and Sb
associated with pure As- and Sb-sulfides (i.e., >3 wt % of total
As
was present as realgar and orpiment and >35 wt % of total Sb occurred
in stibnite; Table 1), which could barely be detected in the intrusive and skarn waste
rock. These primary As- and Sb-sulfides typically oxidize and dissolve
more rapidly than As- or Sb-bearing Cu–sulfides or arsenopyrite,
due to their lower stability: the ΔG°f of realgar and orpiment is −31 to −84 kJ/mol,36 compared to −141 kJ/mol for arsenopyrite
and −206 kJ/mol for enargite.59 Therefore,
rapid dissolution of these more labile sulfides in marble and hornfels
rock could have contributed to high As and Sb leachate concentrations
(Figure 3), despite
“average” solid-phase concentrations compared to other
investigated materials (Figure 1b). Vice versa, anomalously low As and Sb mobilization from
field barrel S10, which contained >10 times more As and Sb than
other
waste rocks (Table S1), may have been facilitated
by the occurrence of As and Sb in more stable Cu– and Fe–sulfides
(Table 1). Unfortunately,
useful As/S or Sb/S ratios in the individual field barrel drainage
chemistries to substantiate the dissolution of the aforementioned
pure As– and Sb–sulfides are obscured by the presence
of a myriad of sulfidic minerals and the precipitation of secondary
sulfates, mainly gypsum.2,52

a The table shows the weight-fractions
of the detected As, Sb, Mo or Se-bearing minerals in their respective
modal composition (wt % of total elemental masses), as well as the
bulk mineralogy of the investigated samples.

Clues to the fate of As and Sb after dissolution of
their primary
sulfide hosts are also provided by the MLA data. Although secondary
mineral phases were undetectable for Sb due to its low abundance versus
instrumental detection limits, all investigated weathered waste-rock
samples contained a substantial proportion of As associated with secondary
(oxy)sulfates or Ca–arsenates (40–59 wt % of the total
As content). Furthermore, As-bearing carbonates were detected in smaller
amounts (up to 7 wt % of As) in the hornfels and marble rocks, consistent
with the high net-neutralization potential and drainage alkalinity
in these materials (Table 1). The secondary nature of these phases is corroborated by
SEM-imaging and semiquantitative analysis of EDS spectra: replacements
and/or alterations rims surrounding primary sulfides and silicates
in skarn field barrel S10 (Figure S5) contained
up to 10 wt % As and traces of Sb (up to 0.7 wt %), i.e., well-above
levels in the associated primary sulfides. In turn, no As and Sb was
detected in alteration rims around sulfides in the marble and hornfels
waste rock (data not shown).

In summary, efficient mobilization
of As and Sb from the hornfels
and marble waste rock compared to the intrusive and skarn waste rock
appears to be related not just to bulk elemental content and/or neutralization
potential (and thus drainage pH) of the waste rock but also to the
presence of these metalloids in more labile sulfide minerals. The
occurrence of As-bearing secondary precipitates across various lithologies
suggests that at least part of the mobilized As is retained under
NRD conditions.

3.4.2 Molybdenum
In
contrast to As and
Sb, the mineralogical distribution of Mo was dominated by the primary
sulfide molybdenite [MoS2] in all studied waste rocks (Table 1). The comparably
low abundance of (secondary) Mo-bearing oxides, (oxy)sulfates, and
Ca- and Pb-molybdates corroborates high mobility for this element,
which was observed particularly under slightly alkaline drainage pH
in the majority of skarn and intrusive waste rock (e.g., barrels I1–I3
and S1–S4). In all of these field barrels, enhanced Mo release
appeared directly related to molybdenite oxidation and negligible
retention, as dissolved Mo and sulfate were strongly correlated (Figure S6). Correlations between Mo and S in
drainage from other field barrels were less evident, suggesting decoupling
through selective adsorption or molybdate precipitation.

The
discrete secondary minerals wulfenite and powellite could be identified
in small amounts in the marble- and skarn waste rock (Table 1). In line with observations
of these minerals in previous field- and laboratory column experiments
with Antamina waste rock,13,27,52 these minerals constitute Mo solubility controls under NRD conditions
where Mo sorption is weak. Molybdenum attenuation through secondary
molybdate precipitation was particularly efficient in the Pb- and
Mo-rich skarn barrel S3, for which a Mo-content >900 mg/kg (Table S1) did not translate into release of appreciable
dissolved Mo (<50 μg/L). The observation of secondary wulfenite
by MLA (Table 1) provides
an explanation to the discrepancy in solid phase and dissolved Mo
produced in this barrel: wulfenite formation is promoted by the high
Pb content in barrel S3 (>1000 mg/kg) and the rapid formation kinetics
and high insolubility (log Ksp ≈
10–13–10–15) for this phase.13

3.4.3 Selenium
Average
Se drainage concentrations
were substantially lower compared to those of As, Sb, and Mo, relating
to lower overall abundance in the studied waste rock. Due to that
low solid-phase content, mineralogical host phases for Se could only
be poorly elucidated (Table 1). Automated quantitative mineralogy indicated that Se was
dominantly associated with galena [PbS] and to a lesser extent with
pyrite [FeS2], suggesting selenide (Se[-II]) substitution
for sulfide into clausthalite [PbSe] or ferroselite [FeSe2], as has been observed in coal waste rock at other sites.30,60 The prevalence of sulfidic-Se associations is further corroborated
by the identification of minor fractions of primary Se-sulfosalts
(<1 wt % of the total Se; Table 1) and by strong correlations (R2 > 0.70) between bulk solid-phase Se and sulfide concentrations
in skarn and intrusive waste rock (Figure S7): the average molar concentration ratios of the solid-phase sulfide
over Se were consistent at ∼10 000 and ∼23 000
for the various skarn and intrusive waste rock materials, respectively,
whereas S/Se ratios could not be determined for the hornfels and marble
waste rock materials due to low Se grades. Less than 1 wt % of secondary
Se-bearing phases were observed across all lithologies, suggesting
high mobility of this element upon oxidative Se-sulfide dissolution.

Correlations of solid-phase Se and sulfide in intrusive and skarn
were mirrored in drainage produced from these barrels, which exhibited R2 > 0.50 in field barrels S2, S3, S7, S11,
I3,
I6 and I10, irrespective of drainage pH (see examples in Figure S7). However, the average molar S/Se concentration
ratios in skarn and intrusive drainage were higher than those in their
respective solid-phases (∼30 000 and ∼200 000,
respectively; Figure S7), indicating some
degree of preferential retention of Se relative to S across the studied
pH range. Selenium retention may be attributable to the fact that
selenite (Se[IV]) can occur as a stable intermediate oxidation product
of Se[-II]11 and is more effectively sorbed
to Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides; in contrast, the analogue species for S (i.e.,
sulfite) is unstable under oxic conditions.16 Because secondary Se phases were not easily detected by MLA, identification
of the precise mechanism of preferential Se retention over S—despite
effective mobilization under NRD conditions—requires further
examination, e.g., of the primary and secondary Se mineralogy and
its aqueous speciation.

3.5 pH-Dependent
As, Mo, Sb, and Se Sorption
Generalizing across waste rock
of similar lithology, the bivariate
plots of drainage pH against oxyanion concentrations (Figure 3) reveal three different “mobilization
regimes”: (i) circumneutral to slightly alkaline conditions
(6 < pH < 9), in which elevated As, Sb, Mo, and Se concentrations
are observed from all waste rock types, (ii) very acidic drainage
(pH < 3.5; attained exclusively by intrusive waste rock), in which
oxyanion concentrations are similarly elevated, and (iii) slightly
acidic conditions (3.5 < pH < 6), in which As, Sb, Mo, and Se
concentrations are orders-of-magnitude lower compared to more alkaline
or very acidic conditions. Equally distinct mobilization regimes are
not observed in the bivariate plot of aqueous sulfate concentrations
versus drainage pH (Figure S8). These observed
regimes of elevated oxyanion mobility under circumneutral and very
acidic conditions, and apparent attenuation under slightly acidic
conditions, can be well explained by sorption.

The studied unweathered
waste rocks contained between 0.7 and 5.0 wt % pyrite and pyrrhotite
(Table S2) but released little dissolved
Fe in their effluents (generally <0.1 mg/L), except under highly
acidic conditions (pH < 3.5; Figures 1 and S2). This
indicates that most Fe precipitated as Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides in the waste
rock during the experiments, which could be confirmed by MLA (Table 1), and follows ample
studies on the weathering of sulfidic waste rock.1,2,5,52

Simulations
of the surface charge of the model Fe–(oxyhydr)oxide
class hydrous ferric oxides (HFO; Figure 4) illustrate that at circumneutral to slightly
alkaline pH, most Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides will have a neutral to negative
net surface charge (isoelectric points for goethite, ferrihydrite,
hematite, and HFO all vary between 7 and 9).16 Under these conditions, the studied oxyanions hold negative charge
(Figure 4): dissolved
Se and Mo are dominantly present as doubly charged selenate ([SeO42–]; pKa1 –
2, pKa2 1.9)11 and molybdate ([MoO42–]; pKa1 2.6, pKa2 3.8),13 respectively, whereas As and Sb occur mainly
as doubly or singly deprotonated arsenate ([H2AsO4–] and [HAsO42–];
pKa1 2.2, pKa2 6.9, pKa3 11.6)21 and antimonate ([Sb(OH)6–]; pKa1 2.9),12 respectively.
This prevents adsorption to hydrous oxide surfaces and may explain
the high mobility of As, Mo, Sb, and Se in neutral to slightly alkaline
drainage conditions. With the decreasing drainage pH (3.5 < pH
< 6), the sorption edge for all of the oxyanions is approached:
most Fe-(oxyhydr)oxide holds (slightly) positive net surface charge,
whereas the oxyanions remain negatively charged (Figure 4), which increases adsorption
and correspondingly lowers drainage concentrations (Figure 3). Finally, at very acidic
pH < 3.5, the aqueous oxyanionic species become increasingly protonated
(i.e., more net-neutral charge) and consequently adsorb more poorly
to positively charged mineral surfaces. Because most Fe–(oxyhydr)oxides
are unstable at pH < 3.5,1,2 their dissolution under
such conditions induces the release of previously adsorbed species
on top of release from ongoing sulfide weathering in the absence of
any attenuation by adsorption or effective secondary mineral precipitation.
Such is illustrated for instance by the simultaneous As and Fe release
upon drainage acidification in field barrel I9 (Figure S9).

Figure 4 Simulation of the surface charge and site distribution
on hydrous
ferric oxide (HFO) and the aqueous speciation of As, Sb, Mo, and Se
(hydrolysis only) under variable drainage pH, performed using the
PHREEQC and the MINTEQ.v4 database. The most abundant surface and
aqueous species and their charge are indicated in each frame. The
point-of-zero-charge of HFO is indicated by the black star in the
top frame. The gray shading corresponds to the pH regions where oxyanions
are mobile as discussed in the text.

In addition to explaining the observed mobilization regimes,
sorption
may also explain differences observed in the oxyanion drainage concentrations
from the different waste-rock types: the elemental Fe-content in the
hornfels and marble waste rock was lower than that of the intrusive
and skarn waste rock (<1 versus >5 wt %, respectively; Table S1), so that a less abundant precipitation
of Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides in the hornfels and marble waste rocks may have
limited availability of adsorption sites for As and Sb and consequently
explain higher loads in the NRD from these waste-rock types (Figure 2). Furthermore, the
mobility of As, Mo, Sb, and Se is enhanced when other ionic drainage
constituents compete for sorption sites,16 e.g., arsenate adsorption to Fe–(oxyhydr)oxides has been
shown to decrease in the presence of sulfate or carbonate (minor competitive
effects but high drainage concentrations) and phosphate or organic
ligands (larger effects but typically lower concentrations in mine
waste-rock drainage) at circumneutral pH.61,62 The high-alkalinity drainage from carbonate-rich marble and hornfels
waste rock, in contrast to the intrusive and skarn materials (Figure 1b), may thus further
enhance As mobility. Unfortunately, such combined effects of variable
drainage chemistries on oxyanion adsorption are not easily resolved,
particularly under the dynamic (seasonally influenced) and high-ionic
strength drainage chemistries typically encountered in mine drainage.
It is, therefore, all of the more interesting that the mobilization
regimes for As, Mo, and Se at pH > 6 and < 3.5 could be largely
reproduced (Figure S10) from the simulation
of their sorption onto HFO from more complex aqueous solutions that
were based on recorded averaged field data (see Supporting Methods) while neglecting effects of, e.g., secondary
mineral precipitation. The fact that the sorption edges of As, Mo,
Sb, and Se appear close together from the field data (Figure 3) despite different pKa values and complexation modes (i.e., mono-
or binuclear inner-sphere [arsenate, selenite] or outer-sphere [selenate,
sulfate], Figure S10)16 suggests that their mobilization is controlled by waste-rock
surface (de)protonation rather than their aqueous speciation. A quantitative
assessment of the role of oxyanion adsorption in controlling waste-rock
drainage quality will, therefore, require the characterization of
the composition and surface properties of relevant mineral phases
that may be heterogeneous and poorly crystalline. For instance, Al-(oxyhydr)oxides
also provide sorption sites for oxyanions: these dissolve at higher
pH (∼4) and before their Fe-analogues during drainage acidification,
which may explain some of the drainage dynamics observed at Antamina.2

3.6 Environmental Implications
The presented
experimental field data shows that the oxyanion-forming trace elements
As, Sb, Mo, and Se can be released in the mg/L concentration range
from both NAG and PAG waste-rock types, and that their mobilization
is greatest under circumneutral to slightly alkaline (6 < pH <
9) drainage conditions. Although oxyanion mobility is limited under
mildly acidic conditions through attenuation by sorption, release
rates increase again below pH < 3.5, mainly through the dissolution
of Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides. The occurrence of elevated concentrations of
metal(loid) oxyanions in mine waste drainage may be more accurately
predicted when not only bulk solid-phase content and overall waste-rock
reactivity are constrained but also the element-specific waste-rock
mineralogy and sorption behavior to prevalent (secondary) minerals
as well. Future environmental risk assessment and management of waste
rock, particularly waste rock with elevated As, Mo, Sb, or Se grades,
should, thus, include a site-specific evaluation of potential metal(loid)
oxyanion mobilization through acidic and, more importantly, neutral
drainage. This could also include the comparison of enrichment factors
or geo-accumulation indices71 in tailings
materials and further downstream environments to constrain trace element
mobility and quantitatively evaluate attenuation.

Drainage quality
from mine waste-rock piles is highly scale-dependent. Compared to
relatively small, fully exposed and oxic field barrels, full-scale
waste-rock storage facilities (i.e., hundreds-of-meters in size) exhibit
orders-of-magnitude longer hydraulic retention times and may contain
oxygen-depleted regions caused by rapid sulfide mineral oxidation
and oxygen-transport limitations.1,54 It may be
expected that anoxic conditions will completely change the mobilization
behavior of the investigated oxyanions: for instance, As[V] sorption
onto HFO is more favorable than that of As[III] below pH 5–6,
whereas As[III] is more strongly adsorbed above pH 7–8.21 Similarly, Se[IV] adsorbs to HFO considerably
more effectively than Se[VI] at circumneutral pH.62 Furthermore, reductive dissolution of Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides
can be induced through evolution toward anoxic conditions and drive
mobilization of previously adsorbed oxyanions. Additional complexity
in large-scale waste rock piles is added by physicochemical heterogeneity,
for example, Mo isotope data on drainage from a full-scale waste-rock
facility collected at the Thompson Creek mine27 showed that Mo retention was significant, even under bulk-alkaline
drainage pH, and was attributed to the existence of small-scale acidic
zones. Similarly, strategic mixing of variably reactive waste rock
during dumping has been used to promote attenuation.39,63 The consideration of these scale effects and material heterogeneity
is, thus, required when evaluating the potential for oxyanion release
from waste-rock piles.
