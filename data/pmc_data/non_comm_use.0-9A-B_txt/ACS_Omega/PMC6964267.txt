of graphene/carbon
nanotube (CNT)/MnOv composites and the
effects of chemical composition and phase transformation on the properties
of the corresponding electrode film. In general, the effect of graphene-to-CNT
ratio (G/C ratio) and the manganese (Mn) content on the morphology,
chemical state, crystallization properties, and microstructure of
the composite material was examined by scanning electron microscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and selected
area electron diffraction. The bonding mechanism between MnOv and graphite-based materials, that is, graphene
and CNTs, is discussed. The influence of the composition of the composites
on the performance of the electrode was investigated using charge–discharge
curves. The faradically active MnOv also
functioned as a considerable cobinder and allowed for a reduced amount
of polymeric binder, which enhanced the conductivity and capacitance
of the electrode. The optimized electrode composition was obtained
based on our present graphene and CNT specifications. In summary,
the results discussed in this article provide significant background
information for future applications of graphene/CNT/MnOv composite electrodes.

1 Introduction
With the rapidly increasing
demand for energy technologies in recent
years, electroactive materials for various kinds of energy conversion
and storage devices such as fuel cells, batteries, solar/thermoelectric/piezoelectric
generators, and supercapacitors are being widely studied.1−8 Among them, supercapacitors have attracted unique research attention
because of their intrinsic features such as, high power density and
excellent durability.7,9,10

Considering the charge–discharge mechanism, supercapacitors
can be classified into three major categories: electrochemical double-layer
capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors, and hybrid capacitors.9,11−13 In general, carbon-based materials such as activated
carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, mesoporous carbon, and
carbon-fiber-based materials are frequently employed as the electrode
material in EDLCs.6,9,11,14−19 Each of these has its specific advantages and disadvantages. Among
them, multiwall CNTs and single-layered graphene have attracted most
research attention because of the corresponding long-term conductivity
and high specific surface area (SSA), respectively.18,19 However, in practice, the contact resistance is huge between CNT–CNT,
CNT–graphene, and graphene–graphene owing to the large
interface between the polymer binder and the nanoparticles. Moreover,
CNT and graphene-based electrodes also suffer from winding into a
group and piling up in stacks, respectively.10,11,20,21 Integrating
them together mitigates those problem to a certain extent.7,10,11,20,22,23

Furthermore,
when transition-metal oxides or electrically active
polymers are involved in the electrodes, faradic redox reactions take
place at the interface between them and the surrounding electrolytes
during the charge–discharge process; these types of electrodes
are known as pseudocapacitors.9−11,22,24,25 Thus, EDLCs
and pseudocapacitors are widely known for their higher power density
and higher energy density compared to each other, respectively. Modification
with these faradically active materials also helps to avoid the stacking
of graphene.26−28 Among various pseudocapacitive materials, manganese
oxides (hereafter denoted as MnOv), including
MnO, MnO2, Mn2O3, Mn3O4, and Mn2O7 are promising candidates
for active electrode materials for supercapacitors9−11,22,23,25,26,29−36 due to their notable electrochemical capacity, wide potential range,
low cost, and environmental friendliness.

For hybrid electrodes,
graphene and CNT composites have been widely
studied as EDLC materials. Recently many efforts have been made to
blend manganese oxide with graphene and/or CNTs to obtain composites
such as CNT/MnOv, graphene/MnOv, and graphene/CNT/MnOv, and the results show that they exhibit higher specific capacitance
and better cycle life compared to pure MnOv.10,30−32,34 Generally, graphene and CNTs are expected to be ideal supporting
materials, as this combination provides remarkable surface area, good
mechanical stiffness, excellent conductivity, and the ability to form
a three-dimensional conducting matrix. However, there are very few
studies in the literature on how these carbon materials bond to metal
oxides. In general, it was well-accepted that −COOH groups
on the carbon fiber and graphene oxide can aid in the extraction of
heavy metals from water, because the −COOH group on the carbon
support captures metal cations such as Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ and form
−COOM, (M = metal).17 According
to this anion adsorption mechanism, MnOv is considered to be coordinated with CNTs through the COO–Mn
linkage.9,10,22,37 However, from the viewpoint of metallurgy, manganese
also has a chemical affinity to carbon, and thus it is known to form
phases of manganese carbides such as, MnC, Mn3C, Mn5C2, Mn7C3, and Mn23C6.38 This suggests that other
than COO–Mn linkage, there are other possibilities for linkages
between the metal oxide and graphite-based materials (Gbased).

Therefore, to optimize the properties of EDLCs, tremendous
attempts
have been made to match, mix, and integrate multiple carbon materials
together through a variety of methods. Moreover, various oxides or
hydroxides of metals or bimetals, such as Ru, Co, Ni, Fe, Ce, Ni,
Mn, V, Bi, Mo, and Ti, have been investigated to make various possible
permutations and combinations.13 Recently
Saeed et al., reported a novel 3-dimensional graphene/CNTs/MoO3 hybrid film as an advance electrode material for asymmetric
supercapacitors.39 In addition, the manufacturing
technology of supercapacitors has matured. Furthermore, the capacitance
and performance also depend on the packaging technology and equipment;
therefore, it is more valuable to work systematically toward a specific
purpose rather than to compete for the highest capacitance. For instance,
methods have been specifically devised to increase the conductivity,
energy density, cost performance, decrease the binder content, and
to better understand the mechanism of electron or ion transfer.

In this study, MnOv was used as the
faradic active material as well as a binder, allowing for the exclusion
of the insulating polymer binder. The effects of graphene-to-CNT ratio
(G/C ratio) on the morphology, Mn content on crystallization, and
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) content on resistance were analyzed
to study the effect of all these on the capacitive behavior. Moreover,
this article confirms the bonding between amorphous MnO2 and Gbased materials and explains its potential for significantly
reducing polymer binder content. The optimized condition was determined
based on the adopted graphene and CNT specifications. Finally, the
results presented here provide valuable building blocks for the future
development of composite electrodes for supercapacitors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Integration and Characterization of Materials
2.1.1 MnOv as a Binder
and the Effect of Graphene-to-CNTs Ratio (G/C Ratio) on the Morphology
of the Composite
The dispersion and morphology of graphene
and CNT mixtures were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
observations. Figure 1a shows the SEM images of a graphene and CNT mixture (Spec.#: G8C2). It is clear that CNTs tend to entangle each
other, and that there are four groups of tangled CNTs, as marked with
dotted circles in Figure 1a. The corresponding magnified images are shown in Figure 1a(i–iv). In
contrast, when integrated with Mn (Spec. #: G8C2-M25), the graphene/CNT/MnOv composites dispersed well without piling up or entangling each other
(Figures 1b and S1c–f). These results strongly suggest
that MnOv is not only a faradically active material, but
it could also significantly act as a cobinder, providing better adhesion
between graphene and CNTs.

Figure 1 SEM images of composites: (a) mixture of graphene
and CNTs (Spec.
#: G8C2) and (b,c) a mixture of graphene, CNTs,
and MnOv (Spec. #: G8C2-M25).

Furthermore, considering the effect of the G/C
ratio on the morphology
of the composite, SEM images of graphene/CNT/MnOv composites with a constant Mn content (25 wt %) were obtained. Figure S1c–f shows that, upon using 25
wt % MnOv as the binder, graphene (Figure S1a) and CNTs (Figure S1b) mixed well and were dispersed easily at the G/C ratios
of 9/1, 8/2, 7/3, and 5/5. Even at a G/C ratio of 2/8 (Figure S1g), it is obvious that each graphene
sheet is isolated in the CNT framework. This result illustrates that
graphene and CNTs are dispersed well at all G/C ratios when using
MnOv as a binder, which is potentially
useful for a wide range of electrode applications. In brief, the optimized
graphene/CNT mixing condition with minimum stacking of graphene can
be obtained with the method reported herein.

2.1.2 Effect of Mn Content on the Morphology of
the Composite
As the capacitance of the material may be influenced
by the variation in morphology caused by varying the Mn content, specimens
with 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 wt % of Mn (i.e., Spec. #: G8C2-M10, G8C2-M15, G8C2-M20, G8C2-M25, G8C2-M30, G8C2-M35, and G8C2-M40, respectively) were analyzed by SEM and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure S2a–g). The obtained SEM and TEM images agree with the conclusions drawn
in the previous section, that is, graphene and CNT can be well dispersed
by adding MnOv. The Mn content of these
composites was examined by SEM–energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDS) analysis, indicating 10.3, 15.9, 21.1, 24.4, 29.9, 35.6, and
40.6 wt % of Mn in G8C2-M10, G8C2-M15, G8C2-M20, G8C2-M25, G8C2-M30, G8C2-M35, and G8C2-M40, respectively. The
SEM and TEM images of G8C2 and G8C2-M10 in Figures 1a and S2(a-1),
respectively, indicate that in a composite with 10 wt % Mn, MnOv was well dispersed and can be observed only
by TEM (Figure S2(a-1)) and not by SEM
(Figure S2a). The MnOv particles with the average dimension of 10 × 40 nm are
randomly dispersed on graphene and CNTs. Upon increasing their content
to 15 wt %, the MnOv particles start to
agglomerate to form particles with a size of up to ca. 250 nm (as
observed in Figure S2b). As the Mn content
increased to 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 wt %, the size of the MnOv particle grew up to ca. 350, 600, 900, 1500,
and 2000 nm, respectively. Because higher specific capacitance should
be obtained with better dispersion,8,40 optimized
specific capacitance (F/g) was expected to be obtained with 10 wt
% of MnOv. However, phase transformation
was also observed with particle agglomeration, which results in a
positive effect on specific capacitance, which will be discussed in Section 2.2.2.

2.1.3 Microstructure of the Composite
The microstructure of the specimens was investigated by TEM analyses
to probe the contact between graphene/CNTs and MnOv. The TEM images of functionalized CNTs (Spec.#: G0C10) and CNT/MnOv (Spec.#:
G0C10-M25) in Figure 2a,b, respectively, suggest that the functionalized
CNTs can be fully covered with a MnOv layer
with a thickness of approximately 15–20 nm. Figure 2c,d shows the corresponding
high-resolution TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
images of specimen CNT/MnOv, indicating
that the whole MnOv phase is in an amorphous
state. In contrast, the TEM images of graphene and graphene/MnOv (Spec.#: G10C0 and
G10C0-M25) in Figure 3a,b, respectively, indicate that MnOv is randomly attached to the graphene sheets. Figure 3c shows the corresponding
high-resolution TEM image, in which most of the MnOv phase is in an amorphous state with a few nanocrystals embedded
in the amorphous phase. The diffraction spots reside along the rings
in the SAED image (Figure 3d), thus proving the existence of both amorphous and nanocrystalline
MnOv on the graphene surface. These observations
prove that our proposed MnOv blending
process helps MnOv to bond well with the
Gbased materials, as well as provide hints that MnOv could also act as a binder for Gbased electrode materials, as reported.41 Considering
graphene/CNT/MnOv ternary composites,
for instance, Figure S2(a-1) evidently
supports our speculation; it shows that MnOv randomly binds graphene and CNTs together.

CNTs and (b) composite of CNTs
and MnOv (Spec. #: G0C10-M25); (c,d) show the high-resolution TEM and
SAED images of (b), respectively.

TEM and SAED images of (b), respectively.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses
were conducted
to understand the mechanism of how amorphous MnOv binds with both the CNTs and graphene. Figure 4 shows the XPS C 1s spectrum of CNTs, graphene,
and their composites with 25 wt % MnOv (i.e., Spec.# G0C10, G0C10-M25, G10C0, G10C0-M25, and G8C2-M25). As reported earlier by Rosillo-Lopez and Salzmann, the binding
energy of COOH (at ca. 289 eV) shifts to 288 eV, suggesting the formation
of COO–M.17 Considering the variation
from CNT to CNT/MnOv observed in the deconvoluted
spectra (Figure 5),
the −COOH peak at ca. 288.85 (Spec.# G0C10) shifted to ca. 288.35 which corresponds to −COOMn (Spec.#
G0C10-M25). This is in agreement
with the previous reports that state that −COOMn bonding assists
MnOv bonding to CNT.9,10,22,37 However, this
explanation only partially supports our assumption regarding how Mn
bonds with the Gbased materials. Consider that in single-layered
graphene, only a trace amount of −COOH groups and −COOMn
bonding can be identified in the XPS C 1s spectra of G10C0 and G8C2-M25, respectively
(shown in deconvoluted spectra in Figure 5). Furthermore, the amorphous MnOv is randomly dispersed on the graphene surface (as
seen in Figures 2 and S2(a-1)). In other words, there may be another
type of bonding that exists between the MnOv and Gbased materials. After integrating with MnOv, the XPS C 1s spectra shown in Figure 5 shows an obvious
peak shift, from C–OH bonding at 285.70 eV (CNT and graphene)
to 285.35 eV, which is attributed to the formation of the C–OMn
bond. These results suggest the possibility of C–OMn sharing
a larger portion of the bonding between MnOv and Gbased materials than C–OOMn.

and
their composite with 25 wt % MnOv (Spec.#
G0C10, G0C10-M25, G10C0, and G10C0-M25).

Figure 6 shows the
deconvoluted XPS O 1s spectra of functionalized CNTs, MnOv, and CNT/MnOv composite (i.e., Spec.# G0C10, MnOv, and G0C10-MnOv). As can be seen,
on one hand, the presence of oxygen on CNT can be attributed to the
presence of −COOH, where the peaks at 531.2, 533.1, and 532.3
eV correspond to C=O, −COOH, and C–OH, respectively.42 On the other hand, the peaks at 529.4, 530.8,
and 532.05 eV represent Mn–O, M–OH, and H–O–H
in MnOv, respectively.43 The peak corresponding to the binding energy at 529.4 eV
represents Mn–O, whereas the peak at 531.3 eV denotes C–O–Mn,
Mn–OH, and C=O (Figure 6). These are the possible major bonding modes in the
CNT/MnOv composite. Furthermore, it is
impossible to deconvolute the peak at 531.3 eV into separate C–O–Mn,
Mn–OH, and C=O peaks, which makes it clear that the
−COOH and C–OH peaks have almost disappeared in the
O 1s region of the XPS spectrum of CNT/MnOv (as indicated by the dotted line in Figure 6). Instead, the C–O–Mn bond
plays a major role in the binding of CNT and MnOv, where C–O–Mn may represent the formation of
bonding through both CNT–OMn and CNT–COOMn. This result
agrees with the results drawn from the XPS analysis of the C 1s region. Figure S3 shows the XPS O 1s spectra of MnOv, CNTs, MnOv/CNTs,
graphene, graphene/MnOv, and graphene/CNT/MnOv (i.e., Spec.# MnOv, G0C10, G0C10-M25, G10C0, G10C0-M25, and G8C2-M25, respectively);
the results show that the integration of graphene and MnOv has the same trend (the variation of O 1s region
of the XPS spectrum) as CNT to CNT/MnOv. According to the above discussion, a scheme is proposed to illustrate
how MnOv binds to Gbased materials
(shown in Figure S4). First, −COOH
groups are formed accompanied with a greater number of −OH
groups (Figure S4a). Consider that the
red bond [in Figure S4 (a-left)] illustrates
the bond that be reacted during the acid treatment, and Figure S4 (a-right) illustrates that after the
acid treatment (the removal of red bonds), the carbon atom may connect
the Gbased materials through one C–C bond (blue
bond) or three C–C bonds (green bonds); in other words, it
could be the C (red atoms) in −COOH group or could be the C
(orange atoms) connecting to −OH group. This model suggests
that the acid strength, reaction temperature, reaction time, and graphitization
degree may affect the −OH/–COOH ratio. Figure S4b also demonstrates how the MnOv can bind well with functionalized Gbased materials
through the O–Mn and COO–Mn bonds.

Figure 6 XPS O 1s spectra of CNTs,
MnOv, and
their composite (Spec. #: G0C10, MnOv, G0C10-M25).

As discussed earlier, Mn also has a chemical affinity
to carbon
and MnC, Mn3C, Mn5C2, Mn7C3, and Mn23C6 are the possible
manganese carbides.38 However, there is
a lack of literature reports discussing this mechanism. In the XPS
analyses, it was known that the M–C (M = metal) binding energy
in the metal carbide should be slightly lower than that of a sp3-hybridized carbon (C–C-sp3) in the C 1s
region and lower than that of M0 in the Mn 2p region.44,45 However, there is no noticeable manganese carbide peaks to be identified
in the C 1s or Mn 2p regions (in Figures 4 and S5), implying
that there is not a considerable amount of manganese carbide in our
composite. In brief, both CNT–OMn and CNT–COOMn are
the only bonding possibilities, and CNT–COMn and CNT–Mn
bonds are not possible between Gbased materials and MnOv in the synthesized composite materials.

With regard to the chemical state of Mn in the composite, the XPS
Mn 2p spectrum of pure MnOv has examined
and deconvoluted, as shown in Figure 7. The results suggest that approximately 25.3, 52.1,
and 22.6% of Mn can be identified as Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+, respectively. Other than pure MnOv, the XPS Mn 2p spectra of CNT/MnOv, graphene/MnOv, and graphene/CNT/MnOv (i.e., Spec.# MnOv, G0C10-M25, G10C0-M25, and G8C2-M25) show no differences
and thus have the same chemical states, as shown in Figure S5. Here, Mn4+ represents the existence
of MnO2, and the Mn3+/Mn2+ ratio
is consistent with the ratio of 2/1 in Mn3O4.27 Thus, the XPS spectra revealed that
there is approximately 77.4% Mn3O4 and 22.6%
MnO2 in MnOv in our materials,
where subscript v equals to 1.4.

2.2 Factors Affecting the Capacitance
2.2.1 Effect of Graphene-to-CNT (G/C) Ratio
To determine the effect of the G/C ratio on the capacitance, electrodes
made with different G/C ratios, that is, Spec. #: G10C0-M25-P10, G9C1-M25-P10, G8C2-M25-P10, G7C3-M25-P10, G5C5-M25-P10, G2C8-M25-P10, and G0C10-M25-P10,
were examined with chronopotentiometric (CP) measurements under a
current density of 1 A/g, as shown in Figure 8a. The trends are clearly illustrated in Figure 8b, and the parameters
are collected in Table 1. These results indicate that when the G/C ratios are 10/0 and 0/10,
the capacitances obtained are 102 and 83 F/g, respectively; this is
due to the SSA of the adopted single-layered graphene (436.7 m2/g) being significantly greater than that of the multiwalled
CNTs (31.9 m2/g). However, the graphene layers tend to
pile up in stacks, which blocks most of the active surface, and hence
it is impossible for G10C0 to perform to its
potential capacity.10,11,20,21 It also is clear that, with the addition
of MnOv, the specific capacity of G10C0-M25-P10 increased obviously.
This improvement could be attributed to both the faradic capacitances
of MnOv and the decreased stacking of
graphene layers.

b 71 wt % Mn in MnOv was
calculated considering the subscript v equals to
1.4, according to the XPS results discussed in Section 2.1.3.

As shown in Figure 8, the capacitance of GwCx-M25P10 is enhanced
with an
increase in the CNT content, and reaches the maximum value of 146
F/g, at a G/C ratio of 8/2. Further increase in the CNT content leads
to a linear decrease in the capacitance, which suggested that minimized
graphene stacking can be reached at a G/C ratio equal to or smaller
than 8/2. However, the capacitance decline with a further increase
in the CNT content, for Spec. #: G7C3-M25-P10 and Spec. #: G5C5-M25-P10, can be attributed to the lower specific
capacitance (SSA) of CNTs. In brief, because graphene tends to pile
up in stacks during the electrode drying process, adding lower content
of CNTs helps to avoid this detrimental stacking. The optimized G/C
ratio that delivers a higher capacity value was found to be 8/2.

2.2.2 Effect of Mn-to-Carbon Ratio
To
examine the effects of the Mn content on the capacitance of the materials,
CP measurements were conducted with specimens G8C2-My-P10 (where y = 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40), based on the G/C ratio of
8/2 discussed in the previous section. As shown in Figure 9, the results indicate that
all CP curves are pseudo-triangular. Without MnOv, G8C2-M0-P10 has
a capacitance of only 30 F/g. With the addition of MnOv, even the MnOv phase
started to agglomerate into particles ranging from several tens of
nm to 900 nm in size, the capacitance increased from 68 to 181 F/g
as the Mn content increased from 10 to 30 wt %. It is worth noting
that the specimen with only 25 wt % Mn (i.e., G8C2-M25-P10; capacitance: 146 F/g) displayed higher
capacitance than pure MnOv (i.e., MnOv-P10; capacitance: 128 F/g), as
depicted in Table 1. Upon increasing the Mn content further from 30 to 40 wt %, the
size of the agglomerated MnOv grew quickly
to 2000 nm and caused declining capacitance.

Figure 9 (a) Galvanostatic charge–discharge
curves of G8C2-My-P10 and (b)
variation of the capacitance as a function of Mn content in G8C2-My-P10 composite, where y represents the Mn content in
the electrode film, which ranges from 0 to 40 wt %.

Phase transformation of MnOv, as the
particle agglomeration takes place, could have some effect on the
specific capacitance. As summarized in the previous section, MnOv on one hand consists of ∼77.4% Mn3O4 and 22.6% MnO2. On the other hand,
according to the observed X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of graphene/CNT/MnOv composites (shown in Figure 10; Spec. #: G8C2-My-P10, where y ranges from 10 to 35), while adding 10–25 wt % of Mn, it
is hard to identify any crystalline peaks of Mn3O4 and MnO2. Subsequently, increasing the Mn content to
30 wt %, the obvious characteristic peaks correspond to Mn3O4 appeared, which matched the standard data card of Mn3O4 (JCPDS 08-0017). The existence of Mn3O4 is consistent with our prediction from the XPS analyses.
Besides the crystalline phase has higher conductivity, and it has
been reported that normal spinel-structured Mn3O4 with Mn2+ in tetrahedral units and Mn3+ in
octahedral units exhibits higher capacity than MnO2.33,35 However, no such characteristic peaks corresponding to MnO2 was seen in any of the XRD patterns, which suggests that 22.6 wt
% of MnO2 tends to be in the amorphous state, whereas aggregation
takes place during our experimental conditions. Therefore, the amorphous
MnO2 phase is considered to bind to graphene and CNTs (Figure S4). In brief, the phase transformation
from amorphous to spinel Mn3O4 confers G8C2-My-P10 for higher capacitance, whereas the MnO2 phase remains
in the amorphous phase and binds with the Gbased materials.

Figure 10 XRD
patterns of G8C2-My composite materials, where “y”
ranges from 10 to 35.

Other than phase transformation, the particles
agglomerated to
an average diameter of 900 nm (in Figure S2e) were also examined by EDS mapping (shown in Figure S6). The EDS map shows that the particle consists of
43, 37, and 20 at. % of carbon, oxygen, and manganese, respectively,
suggesting that the agglomerated particles are actually a mixture
of carbon (43 wt %) and MnOv. In other
words, the nanostructure of the carbon/MnOv mixture may also contribute to a certain extent to the capacitance
and reduce the effect of agglomeration on the total specific capacitance.

In summary, as the Mn content increases to 30 wt %, the capacitance
found increased to 181 F/g and is accompanied both by the crystallization
of Mn3O4 and the agglomeration of the carbon/MnOv mixture. On extending this limit, serious
agglomeration of particles is the primary cause of declining capacitance.

2.2.3 Effect of the PVDF Content on the Capacitance
In addition to the effect of each active component, such as manganese,
graphene, and CNTs, the effect of binder (PVDF) content on our proposed
materials was also examined by the CP and electrochemical impedance
spectra (EIS) analyses. The charge–discharge curves and capacitance
variation trends are shown in Figure 11a. Figure 11b shows the capacitance variation trends with increasing PVDF
content. Upon decreasing the PVDF content from 15 to 5 wt %, the capacitance
increases linearly from 161 to 210 F/g, which is reasonable because
less isolated PVDF would block less of the active area, and the material
would have better conductivity. As shown in Figure 11a, IR drop can be clearly
observed upon adding 15, 10, and 7 wt % PVDF (Spec. #: G8C2-M30-P15, G8C2-M30-P10, and G8C2-M30-P7). Upon decreasing the PVDF content to 5 wt
%, the IR drop is greatly mitigated (Spec. #: G8C2-M30-P5). These results suggest that the conductivity
can be significantly improved by reducing the PVDF content to 5 wt
%.

Figure 11 (a) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of G8C2-M30-Pz and (b)
variation of the capacitance with the PVDF content in G8C2-M30-Pz composite,
where z represents the PVDF content in the electrode
film, which ranges from 3 to 15 wt %.

Figure 12 shows
the EIS spectrum of the electrodes with different binder (PVDF) contents
ranging from 15 to 3 wt %, that is, for Spec. #: G8C2-M30-P15, G8C2-M30-P10, G8C2-M30-P5, and G8C2-M30-P3. The corresponding sheet resistance (Rs) was found to be linear with respect to the PVDF content
as shown in Table 1. Even the electrode specimen G8C2-M30-P3 with 3 wt % PVDF shows the lowest resistance, the
capacitance of which is lower than that of the G8C2-M30-P5 electrode with 5 wt % PVDF.
This is because the G8C2-M30-P3 electrode is not as stable as the G8C2-M30-P5, and it exhibited some peeling during
the charge–discharge process. It is worth mentioning that our
proposed graphene/CNT/MnOv composite can
reduce the PVDF binder content to 5 wt %, whereas for most active
materials, optimized PVDF contents are reported between the range
of 10–25 wt %.9−11,20,21,24,25,35 The reduction in the PVDF content for our
graphene/CNT/MnOv composites can be attributed
to two reasons: (1) CNTs provide longer range connections and (2)
MnOv tends to adhere to the surface of
CNT and graphene, which helps them bind together. These reasons also
lead to the reduction of interface resistance between the graphene
and CNTs. In brief, the addition of MnOv to graphene/CNTs reduced the PVDF content and the electrode resistance,
and thus capacitance was increased. With regard to the cycle stability,
a cycling charge–discharge test was done to examine the durability
of our proposed composite. As shown in Figure S9, our graphene/CNTs/MnOv performs
at 91.0% of its original capacity after 1000 cycles long-term operation,
which is compatible with recent MnO2-based reports.46,47 Finally, a Ragone plot of our proposed graphene/CNTs/MnOv composite material was derived from the CP curves
(in Figure S10); it illustrated the relationship
between the power and energy densities. Revealing that a maximum power
density of 8619 W/Kg (at the energy density of 3.1 W h/Kg) and maximum
energy density of 51.5 W h/Kg (at the power density of 50.3 W/Kg)
can be achieved. These results demonstrated the potential of the graphene/CNTs/MnOv ternary composite electrode for further
applications in supercapacitors.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully demonstrated
that MnOv particles can bind and disperse
well with CNTs and graphene
to form graphene/CNT/MnOv ternary composite
electrodes. With the addition of MnOv (as
a binder), the graphene and CNTs were dispersed well, which helped
avoid the piling up and the entanglement of graphene and CNTs. The
optimized G/C ratio is found to be 8/2. The proposed graphene/CNTs/MnOv composite materials can be obtained with
the addition of 30 wt % of Mn. According to the results obtained from
XPS analyses, a scheme was proposed to explain how MnOv binds with functionalized Gbased materials.
The −COOH functionalization is accompanied by a greater amount
of −OH groups, which would be converted to COO–Mn and
O–Mn bonds that connect the Gbased materials and
MnOv. Moreover, the manganese oxide (MnOv) used in this study is found to be composed
of 77.4% crystallized Mn3O4 and 22.6% amorphous
MnO2. MnOv has proved to serve
as both a faradic material and a cobinder, which improved the capacitance
and reduced the content of the PVDF binder. Finally, the optimized
electrode material (i.e. G8C2-M30-P5) showed a high capacitance of 210 F/g with only 5
wt % PVDF, performed a high cycle stability of 91.0% after 1000 cycles,
and achieved a maximum power density of 8619 W/Kg and energy density
of 51.5 W h/Kg.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Pretreatment of CNTs
CNTs purchased
from Hodogaya Chemical (NT-7, diameter of 65 nm, SSA = 139 m2/g) were pretreated with an acid solution containing 4.5 M nitric
acid and 1.5 M sulfuric acid. Typically, 0.5 g of CNTs were dispersed
and stirred in 100 mL of acid solution at 45 °C for 3 h. The
functionalized CNTs were then filtered and collected using a Büchner
funnel and washed with deionized (DI) water and dried. The functionalized
CNT powder was then used for preparing the composite electrode.

4.2 Synthesis of Graphene/CNT/MnOv Composites
Graphene/CNT, graphene/MnOv, CNT/MnOv, and
graphene/CNT/MnOv composite materials
were prepared by dispersing the desired amounts of graphene, CNT,
and MnOv in acetone. Graphene powder [N002-PDR,
Angstron Materials Inc. (AMI)] with less than 3-graphene layers, x–y dimensions of up to 10 ×
10 μm2, and average SSA of 400–800 m2/g was used in this study. The solution was placed in a sealed glass
bottle and sonicated for 30 min to obtain a uniform dispersion. Subsequently,
10 mL of ethylene glycol was added as a reducing agent, and the resulting
mixture was sonicated for another 30 min. The mixture was then loaded
into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 2 h. The
resulting composite material was washed with DI water and dried overnight
at 60 °C.

4.3 Preparation of Electrodes
Carbon
black Super-P, PVDF, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)
at a desired ratio were added together and stirred for 3 h at 100
°C. Super-P served as the conducting agent and PVDF as the binder.
Each of the dried composite powder specimens listed in Table 1 was then added to the Super-P/PVDF/NMP
solution. Uniform slurries were then obtained after stirring for 1
h. The slurries were subsequently scraped onto 316L stainless steel
sheets (20 mm × 40 mm × 0.1 mm) through a fixed template
(10 mm × 20 mm × 0.1 mm). The obtained electrodes were then
dried at 100 °C in a circulating oven.

4.4 Specimen Designation
A series of
composites were designed for the active materials and investigated
to understand the effects of graphene-to-CNT ratio (G/C ratio) and
the Mn and PVDF contents on the properties of the composite electrode.
As shown in Table 1, the materials such as pure CNT, functionalized CNT, pure graphene,
and manganese oxides are denoted as p-CNT, f-C, p-G, and MnOv, respectively. Graphene and CNT mixtures are referred
to as GwCx; the corresponding specimens integrated with MnOv are referred to as GwCx-My; the corresponding
electrodes bound with the PVDF binder are denoted as GwCx-My-Pz. The suffixes “w” and “x” represent
the G and C content in weight ratio; the suffix “v” represents the Mn content in the graphene/CNT/MnOv composite material, and the suffix “z” stands for the PVDF content (wt %) of the electrodes.

4.5 Characterization
All composite electrode
specimens listed in Table 1 were analyzed ex situ and in situ. For ex situ experiments,
SEM (JSM-7100F) was used to observe the surface morphology, TEM (JEOL
JEM-2100, 200 keV) was used to examine the microstructure, and XRD
analysis (PANalytical X’Pert PRO, Cu Kα radiation, λ
= 0.1541 nm) was used to verify the crystal structure and phase. Nitrogen
adsorption/desorption analysis was carried out under 77 K (Micromeritics,
ASAP2020) and used to determine the SSA. EDS was employed to determine
the electrode compositions and the XPS (ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 VersaProbe)
was used to determine the composition and chemical state of specimens
shown in Table 1.

For in situ analyses, a CP technique was employed to determine the
capacitance (C) of each specimen. Typically, the
CPs were recorded with the response voltage (V) and
time (s) under the desired charge–discharge current (mA) in
the range of −0.2 to 0.8 V. As each electrode had a different
weight, the current was normalized by mass (unit of A/g) for ease
of comparing the results between different electrodes. In this study,
half-cell test analyses were done to conclude the optimized electrode
composition. The CP measurements were carried out in a three-electrode
cell using 1 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte,
with Pt and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively.
Instead of using glassy carbon or graphite rods, a stainless-steel
sheet, which provides a high electrode area (200 mm2) and
thus excellent accuracy, was utilized as the support for the working
electrode. The EIS were then measured with signals operating at a
frequency range between 30 mHz and 1000 kHz.

The gravimetric
capacitances were calculated according to eq 1, where I is the charge–discharge
current, Δt stands for the time differential, m represents
the mass of the active electrode material, and ΔV is the voltage range of scanning segments. The cell device capacitance Cs, energy density (De), and power density (Dp) were also calculated
from the cyclic chronopotentiometric curves, according to eqs 2 and 3.7,22 1   2   3
