In
this study, Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst
was prepared using a citric sol–gel method and was used as
a catalyst for a water–gas shift (WGS) reaction. Compared to
1 wt % Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Y2O3 catalysts,
the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst showed
a much higher WGS catalytic activity. At 250 °C, the conversion
of carbon monoxide was 86.35% at a weight hourly space velocity of
30 000 cm3 gcat–1 h–1. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts
were investigated via X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy,
chemisorption, H2 and CO temperature-programmed reduction,
and in situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy.
These results confirmed that the catalytic activity did not depend
on the dispersion and particle size of platinum. The high reducibility
of the Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support plays
a crucial role in improving the activity of the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst, and this improvement can also
be explained by the reduction in CO adsorption strength.

Introduction
A water–gas shift (WGS) reaction
is important for high-purity
hydrogen production, and this WGS reaction can increase the H2 concentration as well as decrease the CO concentration in
feed streams for fuel cell applications. The WGS reaction is moderately
exothermic, reversible, and equilibrium limited. It occurs in two
steps to overcome the thermodynamic restrictions of the WGS reaction
at higher temperatures.1 A high-temperature
shift reactor is used to rapidly convert CO, and a low-temperature
shift reactor is used to shift the equilibrium toward H2 production. However, commercially available WGS catalysts are not
appropriate as compact reformers for low-temperature fuel cells. Furthermore,
the WGS catalysts have problems related to: (1) volume, weight, and
cost (30–50% of the fuel processor), (2) transient response
to changes in feed composition and temperature, (3) pyrophoricity,
(4) deactivation in the presence of excess steam, (5) and the long
time, that is, a lengthy precondition step is necessary for catalyst
activation. Many attempts have been made to develop novel catalysts
for a single-step WGS reactor to solve the disadvantages of using
commercial WGS catalysts.2 Noble metal
(e.g., Pt, Pd, and Au)-based catalysts have been reported as promising
single-stage WGS catalysts due to their high catalytic activity at
low temperatures as well as tolerance in chemical poisoning.1 Among noble catalysts, highly active and stable
Pt-based catalysts have been extensively studied for compact fuel
cell applications.3 Reducible Pt-based
catalysts have been found to show a higher activity compared to that
of Rh, Ru, or Pd,4 and various metal oxide
supports have also been investigated to increase the catalytic activity
with low-temperature WGS reactions. Panagiotopoulou et al.4,5 reported that the WGS catalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts depends
strongly on the support’s physicochemical properties, and this
activity significantly depends on reducible support rather than irreducible
support. Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been extensively investigated
for use as water–gas shift catalysts.6−8 However, the
activity and stability of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst at low temperatures
still need to improve.9 Many studies have
examined ceria-based mixed oxides supporting Pt catalysts, including
Pd/CeO2–TiO2,10 Pt/CexZr1–xO2,11 Pt/Si–Ce,12 and Pt/Ce1–xLaxO2−δ,13,14 to increase the reducibility of the catalyst. Pt supported on Ce-rich
Pt/CexZr1–xO2 samples is more active than that on Pt/CeO2,15,16 and Jeong et al.17 reported that the Pt/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst exhibits a high Pt dispersion and supports reducibility
and oxygen storage capacity.

In this study, we used the Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Y(NO3)3 precursors to obtain the
oxygen vacancy for nonstoichiometric Ce0.6Y0.4O2−δ excluding zirconium. We synthesized
platinum catalyst supported on cerium–yttria (1 wt % Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2) by the citrate sol–gel
method for a low-temperature WGS reaction, and the physicochemical
characteristics and redox properties of the catalysts were investigated
via temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and diffuse reflection infrared
Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analyses.

Results and Discussion
Catalytic
Activity and Physicochemical Characteristics
Figure 1 shows the
CO conversions of Pt/CeO2, Pt/Y2O3, and Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts as
a function of reaction temperature at a weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) of 30 000 cm3 gcat–1 h–1. Considerable differences in catalytic activity
at 250 °C were observed depending on the support. The Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst is significantly more
active than Pt/Y2O3 and Pt/CeO2.
For Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2, the CO conversion
was about 86.35% at 250 °C, and complete conversion (100%) of
CO was achieved at 300–400 °C, reaching equilibrium values.
The Pt/CeO2 catalyst showed higher CO conversion than the
Pt/Y2O3 catalyst at 250 °C. We compared
the low-temperature water–gas shift activity over our Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst with previously reported
Pt-based catalysts, and these results are summarized in Table 1. Of course, a direct comparison
cannot be performed accurately due to the difference in experiment
conditions, such as space velocity, pressure, inlet gas concentration,
Pt dispersion, and loadings. Most importantly, the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst prepared by the sol–gel
method has been first reported in this study, and it has a superior
catalytic activity at 250 °C. We only confirmed that the long-term
stability of Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst
was well maintained for 24 h at the temperature at 250 °C (not
shown). However, in this study, in case of catalysts of Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Y2O3, as the initial conversion
was very low at 250 °C, catalytic stability was not compared.

Figure 2 shows the
XRD patterns of Pt/CeO2, Pt/Y2O3,
and Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts. For
the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the XRD pattern of CeO2 consists of six main peaks at 28.57, 33.00, 47.60, 56.39, 59.13,
and 69.51° corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311), (222),
and (400) planes, respectively. The cubic ceria phase with a fluorite
structure was observed in XRD analysis (JCPDS card no. 34-394).24 For the Pt/Y2O3 catalyst,
the XRD pattern of Y2O3 consists of five main
peaks at 20.5, 29.2, 33.9, 48.6, and 57.7° corresponding to (211),
(222), (400), (440), and (622) planes, respectively. The pattern exhibits
well-defined diffraction high-crystallinity peaks, and all peaks were
attributed to the cubic structure of Y2O3 (JCPDS
card no. 86-1326, space group Ia3̅).25 The diffraction peaks of Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts showed a difference in the
intensity, and the full width at half maximum of the peaks was changed.
Ce0.6Y0.4O2 mixed support existed
in amorphous phase as distortions of the CeO2 and Y2O3 lattices regardless of the Ce–Y synthesis.
This indicates that the substitution of cerium ions (0.092 nm) by
similar Y ions (0.090 nm)26 in the Ce0.6Y0.4O2 mixed oxide support could occur,
and the interaction of Ce and Y could destroy the long-range order
structure of CeO2 or Y2O3 by using
a Ce and Y precursor in the citric acid sol–gel process.

The physicochemical characteristics and turnover frequency
(TOF)
at 250 °C of the Pt-based catalysts are shown in Table 2. The specific surface area
of the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst (63.68
m2 g–1) is much higher than that of Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Y2O3. The Pt dispersion results
showed that platinum is well dispersed for the Pt/CeO2 catalyst
(34.27% by CO, 92.52% by H2), whereas Pt dispersions of
the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 (18.89% by CO,
36.39% by H2) and Pt/Y2O3 (13.30%
by CO, 32.97% by H2) catalysts are lower than that of the
Pt/CeO2 catalyst. The calculated TOFs at 250 °C for
all catalysts are also presented in Table 2. The TOFs are more than 3 times higher for
the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst than
for Pt/CeO2. A TEM analysis was conducted to observe the
particle size of Pt, and the results are shown in Figure 3. Interestingly, the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst had the smallest Pt
size of approximately 2.3–3.4 nm, and the particle sizes of
Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Y2O3 were about 4.1–7.5
and 4.8–14.7 nm, respectively. According to the above XRD and
specific surface area results, the crystalline peak of the synthesized
Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support was quite broad
and has relatively very large specific surface area and pore volume.
The fact that Pt dispersion is small when Pt is impregnated in Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support means that the quantity
of CO gas to be adsorbed is little, and it could be presumed that
Pt exists even in pore bulk of Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support. This is probably the reason why Pt is well incorporated
into the bulk amorphous phase of the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst. These results for the physicochemical characteristics
indicate that the catalytic activity does not depend on the metal
dispersion or metallic surface area for Pt/CeO2, Pt/Y2O3, and Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts. The results (Table 2) also reveal that there is no direct relation between
the specific surface area and total pore volume of the catalysts and
their catalytic activity. The effect of enhancing the WGS activity
of the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts is
the chemical nature of the support and is not related to the morphological
or structural properties of the Pt. In summary, catalytic activity
was strongly affected by the Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support and active metal with redox properties rather than
by Pt dispersion. If CO adsorption occurs on the support or interface
site, the compared activity in terms of TOF is meaningless. The factors
that affect the redox properties of Pt/CeO2, Pt/Y2O3, and Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts need to be examined. These results are in good agreement
with earlier work by Panagiotopoulou et al.,6 who reported that the turnover frequency (TOF) does not depend on
the metal loadings and dispersion or crystallite size for various
noble metal-based catalysts such as Pt/CeO2, Pt/TiO2, Ru/TiO2, and Pt/Al2O3.

Redox Properties
H2 TPR experiments were
performed to investigate the reducibility of the catalyst used in
this study. Figure 4a shows the H2 TPR profiles of the pure CeO2, TiO2, and Ce0.6Y0.4O2 supports. For the CeO2 support, the TPR peak of CeO2 shows two reduction bands. The first low-temperature band
(max. 450 °C) was caused by the reduction of the surface ceria.27−30 This reduction pathway has been founded in terms of the removal
of surface capping oxygen ions attached to surface Ce4+ species.29 The high-temperature reduction
band (max. 790 °C) in the reference material is attributed to
the reduction of bulk CeO2 to Ce2O3.30 For the Y2O3 support, the reduction of the Y2O3 support
alone is difficult, with no TPR peak observed at all temperature ranges.
Compared to the TPR of individual CeO2 and Y2O3 supports, the reduction curves in the Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support increase. This result indicates
an increase in the reducibility by introducing a yttria element into
the ceria lattice, and this is in good agreement with other detailed
studies.16 Lee et al.31 reported that when the Ce ion was doped into the TiO2 support, reduction peaks of the Ce/TiO2 catalyst
emerged at 410, 480, and 515 °C. The first peak (410 °C)
was attributed to a reduction of the surface oxygen as stoichiometric
ceria (Ce4+–O–Ce4+),32 and the second peak (480 °C) was attributed
to a reduction of the nonstoichiometric ceria (Ce3+–O–Ce4+).33 Unlike other catalysts, the
reduction peaks of the Ce/TiO2 catalyst slightly overlapped
at 515 °C, and this may be due to a slight reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ in the bulk TiO2 after the
ceria oxide on the surface has been reduced by hydrogen. Compared
to the reduction properties of pure CeO2 and TiO2 and Ce/TiO2 catalysts, the reduction temperature of the
Ce/TiO2 catalyst decreased, which is likely due to interactions
between Ce and TiO2. The interactions between ceria and
the TiO2 phase are weaker. As a result, the reduction of
Ce4+–O–Ce4+ or Ce4+–O–Ti4+ species of Ce/TiO2 occurs
at a lower temperature than that in other catalysts. This result means
that reduction was increased by Ce ion impregnated into the TiO2 support with a lower calcination temperature. In this study,
according to the literature described above, reduction peaks for the
Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support emerged at 324,
390, and 488 °C. The first reduction peak at 324 °C was
attributed to a reduction of the surface oxygen of the nonstoichiometric
ceria and yttria (Ce–O–Y), the second peak at 390 °C
was attributed to a reduction of the stoichiometric ceria (Ce4+–O–Ce4+), and the last peak at 488
°C was attributed to a reduction of the nonstoichiometric ceria
(Ce3+–O–Ce4+). The reduction profiles
of platinum catalysts supported on CeO2, Y2O3, and Ce–Y are presented in Figure 4b. The Ce–Y synthesis of the supports
after platinum impregnation leads to the formation of platinum oxides
with a different stoichiometry depending on the type of support,34−36 and Pt-based catalysts have a lower temperature peak and two broad
peaks at 50–200 and 300–600 °C. Reduction peaks
of Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Y2O3 have very
low intensity compared to that on cerium-modified Y2O3 support. Lower temperature reduction peaks were attributed
to a reduction in the surface PtOx species.6 Reduction peaks at medium temperatures (300–600
°C) were attributed to a reduction peak of the interaction with
Pt and Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support or Ce0.6Y0.4O2 supports. All these observations
in the TPR results confirm that Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4, which has high WGS activity, showed a lower TPR peak (PtOx) at low temperature as well as high oxygen
mobility of Ce0.6Y0.4O2 species.
This increase in the O2– ion concentration (related
to oxygen vacancies) with the synthesis of Ce0.6Y0.4O2 supports reflects high oxygen mobilities of PtOx and Ce0.6Y0.4O2 species and thus easily participates in the WGS reaction.

and Ce0.6Y0.4O2 supports
and (b) Pt/CeO2, Pt/Y2O3, and Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts.

CO TPR results provide relative amounts of reducible all
sites
(support or active metal or interface) by CO adsorption on the catalyst
surface, and we can determine the continuous CO reduction reaction
pathway with reaction temperature. Thus, CO TPR experiments were also
performed, and the results are shown in Figure 5, in which the responses of CO2 and H2 produced are plotted as functions of temperature.
In this study, a reduction CO peak of Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4 has a very large consumption peak compared to that on the Pt/CeO2 and Pt/Y2O3 catalysts.

Figure 5 CO TPR profiles of Pt/CeO2, Pt/Y2O3, and Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts:
(a) CO profile, (b) CO2 profile, and (c) H2 profile.

For the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4 catalyst, the reduction
profile of CO consists of a low-temperature peak at 100–180
°C, a medium-temperature broad peak evolving from 200 to 400
°C, and a high-temperature peak, which appears at temperatures
around 550–800 °C. The CO2 peak was observed
and the H2 peak was not observed in Figure 6b,c. Thus, the first peak at 100–180
°C was attributed to a reduction in the PtOx species as follows 1  The CO2 profile at medium temperature
(200–400 °C) is always accompanied by the formation of
H2; this result indicates that CO2 and H2 are formed at the same time. Because the only hydrogen source
is the −OH group on the support, the simultaneous formation
of CO2 and H2 can be attributed to the WGS reaction37 as follows 2  Panagiotopoulou
et al.37 showed that the reaction occurs
at the metal–support
interface between the CO adsorbed on the metallic Pt site and −OH
groups on the support. Finally, the CO2 profile at a high
temperature (550 °C) was observed with the CO reduction profile,
and it can be attributed to the CO consumption reaction as follows 3  However, the high temperature (550 °C)
was not within the WGS reaction temperature region. Thus, the reduction
in Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 at medium temperatures
(180–500 °C) is important within this temperature region.
Zhu et al.19 reported that the main reaction
pathways suggested for the WGS reaction over the reducible Pt catalyst
is an associative pathway with an interaction of CO on Pt metal with
hydroxyl groups on the support, leading to the formation of formate
species, which then decomposes to CO2 and H2.28

Bruix et al.38 reported that the strong
Pt metal and CeO2 support interaction significantly enhances
the ability of the admetal of dissociating the O–H bonds in
water due to large electronic change. A redox pathway, CO adsorbed
on Pt is oxidized by oxygen ion from the support to form CO2 and the oxygen vacancy site is refilled by H2O with releasing
H2 as redox pathway.39 On
the basis of our study, the Ce0.6Y0.4O2-supported Pt catalyst improved catalyst reducibility, favoring the
creation of OH groups as active sites related to oxygen defects in
the support for the WGS reaction.12

DRIFT
Study
Figure 6 shows the DRIFT results from the Pt/Y2O3,
Pt/CeO2, and Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts. The adsorbed CO species were examined by
injecting CO gas in the temperature range from 25 to 300 °C.
For the Pt/Y2O3 catalyst (Figure 6a), two bands were maintained in the temperature
range from 25 to 100 °C; these bands were attributed to CO adsorbed
on the Ptδ+ sites (2085 cm–1) and
CO adsorbed on PtO (2112 cm–1).37 The broad bands observed at 2175 cm–1 are due to CO gas, which are present in all spectra. The bands observed
at 2085 cm–1 were attributed to vibrational frequencies
higher than those expected from the CO adsorbed on reduced Pt metal
sites and, consistent with previous results,40,41 can be attributed to CO adsorbed on partially oxidized platinum
(Ptδ+–CO). The linearly adsorbed CO peak on
the metallic Pt sites was observed at 2068 cm–1,
which is more thermally stable, and this peak disappeared at temperatures
higher than 200 °C. All CO bands disappeared upon an increase
in temperature to above 300 °C. The DRIFT spectra of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst are shown in Figure 6b. The relative intensities of the bands attributed
to CO adsorbed on Ptδ+ sites (2085 cm–1) and PtO (2112 cm–1) are higher than those of
the Pt/Y2O3 catalyst. The band attributed to
CO adsorbed on Ptδ+ sites (2085 cm–1) was maintained in the spectra up to 100 °C and the band disappeared
over 150 °C. The CO adsorbed on the PtO (2112 cm–1) band was maintained in the temperature range from 25 to 300 °C.
The CO adsorbed on PtO bands disappeared upon an increase in temperature
to above 300 °C, which is thermally more stable and exhibits
a strong PtO–CO bond. The DRIFT spectra of the highly active
Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts are shown
in Figure 6c. The spectrum
for the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst is
characterized by two bands in the CO adsorbed on PtO (2112 cm–1), and the bands observed at 2175 cm–1 are due to gas-phase CO. The bands attributed to the CO adsorbed
on Ptδ+ sites (2085 cm–1) were
not observed. The most interesting observation is that the temperature
required to eliminate CO adsorbed on the PtO peak (100 °C) is
much lower than that required for the Pt/Y2O3 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts (250–300 °C). This
clearly shows that Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst results in a significant enhancement of the activation
of the adsorbed CO species and a very weak PtO–CO bond. It
indicates the relative adsorption strength of CO; this result indicated
that the weakly adsorbed CO is easily desorbed from the catalyst surface
at low temperature. It is believed that the strong adsorption of CO
could block the active sites and it could reduce the rate of reaction
at low temperature. From the DRIFT results of Pt/Y2O3, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalysts, the disappearance of the peak may reasonably
suggest that the adsorbed CO can react with oxygen from the Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support for the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst. In contrast, adsorption of
CO is still strong, which makes it difficult to transport oxygen from
Y2O3 or CeO2 to CO chemisorbed on
Pt sites for Pt/Y2O3 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts.

Conclusions
The catalytic performances and properties were
investigated for
Ce0.6Y0.4O2-supported platinum catalysts
prepared by the citric sol–gel method for low-temperature water–gas
shift reaction. The WGS catalytic activity of the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst was greatly enhanced compared
to that of the Pt/Y2O3 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts. The catalytic activity does not depend on the metal dispersion
or metallic surface area, whereas the increase in activity is directly
correlated with an enhancement in the reducibility of the support.
The Ce0.6Y0.4O2-supported Pt catalyst
improved the catalyst reducibility, favoring the creation of OH groups
as active sites related to oxygen vacancy in the support for a WGS
reaction. Furthermore, a high reducibility of the Ce0.6Y0.4O2 support plays an important role in increasing
the activity, and the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst can reduce the CO adsorption strength.

with commercial CeO2 (<5 μm, 99.9%) and Y2O3 (99.99%) supplied by Aldrich Chemical Co. The
CeO2 and Y2O3 supports were prepared
by impregnation with PtCl4 (>99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
Co.) aqueous solution at the required concentration to obtain 1 wt
% Pt. The calculated amount of PtCl4 (>99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Co.) was dissolved in distilled water at 80 °C. Next,
the calculated amount of CeO2 or Y2O3 support was slowly added to the solution while stirring. The mixed
solution was agitated as a slurry for over 1 h, followed by evaporation
at 70 °C using a rotary vacuum evaporator (Eyela Co. N-N series).
After evaporation, the slurry was dried at 110 °C for 24 h. To
remove the residual chlorine, the catalyst was reduced in a tubular
furnace at 300 °C using 30% H2 for 1 h and finally
calcined at 400 °C in air for 4 h. Then, the obtained samples
were ground and sieved through a 40–50 mesh. To combine the
Ce and Y precursors, the Ce0.6Y0.4O2−δ support was prepared by citrate sol–gel method, as previously
described in the literature.14 In particular,
a calculated amount of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (>99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) and Y(NO3)3·6H2O (>99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
Co.) precursor was dissolved in distilled water to form a 0.1 M solution
of the total metal ions. The solution pH was kept at 2.0 through the
dropwise addition of 5 M nitric acid solution. Then, citric acid was
added about 1.5 times the total molar amount of metal ions in solution.
The mixed solution was heated up to 70 °C while stirring to assist
in the polymerization and condensation reactions. Finally, a gel-like
yellowish material was obtained. After drying at 110 °C for 24
h, the solid powder became spongy. Then, the sample was calcined at
400 °C in an air atmosphere to eliminate all organic residues
from the synthesis procedure. The 1 wt % Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2 catalyst was prepared in accordance with the
same procedure given above for 1 wt % Pt/CeO2 and 1 wt
% Pt/Y2O3 catalysts. Finally, the Pt/Ce0.6Y0.4O2−δ catalyst can
be obtained.

Catalytic Activity Test
Water–gas
shift activity
tests were performed with a H2O to CO ratio of 3 and a
weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 30 000 cm3 gcat–1 h–1. The gases
fed to the reactor consisted of 5% CO and 15% H2O/N2 using mass flow controllers (MKS, Mass Flow Controller).
Water was pumped into a vaporizer superheated at 450 °C using
a micro liquid pump (Jasco, MINICHEMI PUMP). The water–gas
shift apparatus consisted of a fixed-bed reaction system composed
of a quartz tube (inner diameter: 8 mm; height: 650 mm) and a catalytic
bed fixed using quartz wool. The gas composition was detected using
an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity
detector and two packed columns (6 Å molecular sieves and Porapak-Q).
A pressure indicator (Alicat, PC-100PSIG-D) was used to measure the
pressure drop in the catalyst bed.

The turnover frequency (TOF)
is defined as moles of converted CO per mole of exposed Pt atoms on
the surface per second. The exposed Pt atoms on the surface were calculated
from the dispersion obtained from CO chemisorption.

Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X’Pert
PRO MRD) with Cu Kα radiation.

Temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) with H2 was measured using 10% H2/Ar at a total flow rate of 50 cm3 min–1 and 0.3 g of catalyst. Prior to the H2 TPR experiment,
the catalyst was pretreated at 400 °C at a flow rate of 10% O2/Ar for 0.5 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature.
The hydrogen consumption was monitored by increasing the temperature
to 800 °C (10 °C min–1) using Autochem
2920 (Micrometrics).

The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
of CO was measured using
5% CO/Ar and 0.3 g of the catalyst at a total flow rate of 50 cm3 min–1. Before the CO TPR measurement, the
catalyst was pretreated at 400 °C at a flow rate of 10% O2/Ar for 0.5 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature.
During the CO TPR experiments, H2 (2) and CO2 (44) products were continuously monitored by increasing the temperature
to 800 °C (10 °C min–1) using a quadrupole
mass spectrometer (QMS 200M).

Field emission-transmission electron
microscope (TEM) images were
obtained with a JEM-2100 F (JEOL) microscope (200 keV voltage). All
catalyst powders were prepared by suspending an ultrasonicated catalyst
powder in ethanol and placing the suspension on a Cu grid.

The
dispersion and crystallite size of the catalysts were characterized
via CO or H2 chemisorption at 50 °C using Autochem
2920 (Micrometrics). The catalyst samples were activated with 10%
H2 at 400 °C for 0.5 h and then cooled to 50 °C
and saturated with CO or H2 pulses.

The surface area
and total pore volume of the catalysts were analyzed
using ASAP 2010 C (Micromeritics Co.), and the values were calculated
using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation. Each sample
was analyzed after degassing in a vacuum at 110 °C for 3–5
h.

In situ IR spectra were collected using a 660 plus Fourier
transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (JASCO) equipped with a CaF2 window and an mercury cadmium telluride detector, by recording 30
scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1. All catalysts were
preheated in Ar at 400 °C for 1 h. Then, a mixture of 5% CO/Ar
gas was fed into the sample. After steady state was reached, the FT-IR
spectra were recorded at 25–350 °C.
