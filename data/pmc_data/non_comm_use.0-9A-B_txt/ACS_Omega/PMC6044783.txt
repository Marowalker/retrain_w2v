Herein, we reveal a second quorum-sensing system
produced by Cronobacter sakazakii.
A cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu) diketopiperazine, detected
in pure and mixed cultures of C. sakazakii and Bacillus cereus explains the
coexistence of both in the same industrial environments. The molecule
was identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), 1H, and 13C NMR, including 2D NMR (correlation spectroscopy,
heteronuclear multiple bond correlation, and heteronuclear single
quantum correlation), and the absolute configuration was compared
with that of four synthetic standards produced by solid phase peptide
synthesis using a chiral column on a GC–flame ionization detection.
This article provides a new method to determine the absolute configuration
of cyclo(Pro–Leu) diketopiperazine replacing the joint use
of 1H NMR and Marfey’s method.

Introduction
Cronobacter
sakazakii, a Gram-negative,
yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium,
is an opportunistic pathogen that is life-threatening for newborns
and elderly adults.1 This microorganism
is naturally found in the environment and is present in dry foods
such as powdered milk, spices, teas, and starches, surviving desiccated
conditions. This bacterium can adhere to surfaces, be soaked in an
exopolysaccharide matrix (biofilm), and be protected from neighboring
threats.2 The biofilm formation is controlled
by low-molecular-weight molecules in a process of intercommunication
called quorum-sensing (QS), and it is known that
Gram-negative bacteria are likely to communicate by producing acyl-homoserine
lactones (AHL).3C. sakazakii is known to produce 3-oxo-hexanoyl-HSL, 3-oxo-octanoyl-HSL,4 (S)-N-heptanoyl-HSL,
(S)-N-dodecanoyl-HSL, (S)-N-tetradecanoyl-HSL,5 and short chain acyl-HSL6 for QS. The
exopolysaccharide matrix can shelter other microorganisms like Bacillus cereus, which is a Gram-positive bacterium
and also an infecting agent that causes intestinal and nonintestinal
infections in humans; it is commonly associated with food poisoning,7 causing acute diarrheal disease, which is related
to the production and secretion of a variety of hemolysins, phospholipases,
and toxins.7 This spore-forming bacterium
withstands low temperatures, making the control of its contamination
and biofilm formation on plastics, glasses, wool, and inox steel difficult,
which impacts public health and the economy.8,9 Some Bacillus sp. have been investigated for secondary
metabolites, revealing the presence of cyclic dipeptides, called 2,5-diketopiperazines
(DKPs), used as antifungal and antibacterial agents. Bacillus cereus, from an entomopathogenic nematode,
produces cyclo(l-Pro–l-Arg) with antibacterial
and antitumor actions,10 and B. cereus subsp. thuringiensis produces an antifungal cyclo(l-Pro–d-Leu).11 The four isomers occur in nature, however, their
optical rotation data are highly unreliable, thus preventing a rapid
absolute configuration determination.12−14

Araujo and co-workers5 studied C. sakazakii and B. cereus in a co-culture and
detected C. sakazakii’s acyl-homoserine
lactone depletion by B.
cereus enzymes (acyl-HSL lactonase and acyl-homoserine
acylase). However, this depletion did not inhibit the biofilm formation
or C. sakazakii growth, suggesting
the presence of alternative signaling molecules for the C. sakazakii and B. cereus QS system. Therefore, the aim of this work is to reveal the cross-talking
signal system between C. sakazakii and B. cereus.

Results and Discussion
The absence
of biofilm inhibition in co-cultures of C. sakazakii and B. cereus, as previously reported,
was intriguing. Thus, the presence of a
secondary communication exclusive to C. sakazakii and a cross-communication system between both species, was the focus
of the present investigation. Consequently, C. sakazakii and B. cereus were cultivated individually,
and co-cultivated, to evaluate the second mechanism of intra- and
inter-species chemical communication. The cell-free supernatants were
extracted with ethyl acetate, and a common group of DKPs was effectively
detected that was completely unaccounted for in our previous investigation.
Isolation of the polar fractions was achieved using a silica column
eluted with ethyl acetate; methanol allowed the identification of
the major DKP as the cyclic dipeptide cyclo(Pro–Leu) (Figure 1). The retention
time and fragmentation pattern were consistent with data found in
the literature.15,16

Figure 1 Structure of cyclo(Pro–Leu).

NMR data confirmed the structure
of the DKP and showed the 1H and 13C shifts
for cyclo(Pro–Leu) isolated
from B. cereus, C. sakazakii, and the culture of both bacteria (see Supporting Information). 2,5-DKPs are QS molecules commonly found in Gram-positive
bacteria and are not usually present in Gram-negative bacteria such
as C. sakazakii, where the QS is based
on AHL. However, previous studies have shown that DKPs can modulate
regulatory proteins for gene expression, substituting AHLs in Gram-negative
bacteria’s communication.17,18 From this
point of view, this work shows that despite the B.
cereus enzymes destroying C. sakazakii’s AHLs, both B. cereus and C. sakazakii share a common signal for communication,
the cyclo(Pro–Leu). Following this discovery, a few pending
questions remained unanswered. The most important question was the
absolute configuration of the cyclo(Pro–Leu) and whether this
was important for the intercrossing communication. The first attempts
to determine the absolute configuration employing specific optical
rotation were complicated by the broad range of values of specific
optical rotations reported in the literature (Table 1). An additional drawback was the lack of
a rapid chiral chromatographic method to check the enantiopurity of
the samples.

The optical rotation ([α]D) values were mainly
dependent on the absolute configuration of proline in proline-based
DKPs. Negative [α]D values were observed for l-proline DKPs, and positive [α]D for d-proline DKPs. Additionally, the magnitude was variable, but l-Pro–l-Leu showed higher negative values and l-Pro–d-Leu showed lower negative values of
[α]D. The same result was observed for d-proline derivatives, where d-Pro–d-Leu
presented higher positive values and d-Pro–l-Leu presented lower positive values.30

Comparing the optical rotation of the standards and natural
samples,
we became aware that different amounts of stereoisomers were present
in the mixtures. The B. cereus cyclo(Pro–Leu)
had an [α]D of −28, and C.
sakazakii cyclo(Pro–Leu) had an [α]D of −21, but the mixed culture had an [α]D of −27. The results were clear but not conclusive.
Other procedures were needed to determine the absolute configuration.

Many literature reports11,24,31,32 have utilized Marfey’s
method for enantiomeric identification, which consists of hydrolysis
and derivatization using a chiral compound (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine amide), and high-performance liquid chromatography
elution in a silica gel column.33 This
method has been very effective in revealing the absolute configurations
of the amino acids, which are the 2,5-diketopiperazine components.
However, the method depends on hydrolysis and derivatization of the
DKPs, which is a time-demanding procedure. The use of gas chromatography
(GC) is expected to be less demanding but requires the selection of
a column with effective enantio- and diastereodiscrimination. Thus,
to investigate the enantiodiscrimination of cyclo(Pro–Leu)
by the available chiral columns, we either had to have racemic standards
or pure samples of the four isomers, that is, cyclo(d-Pro–d-Leu), cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu), cyclo(l-Pro–d-Leu), and cyclo(d-Pro–l-Leu).

Optimization of the chiral gas chromatographical
method was undertaken
with the four stereoisomeric standards, which are not commercially
available, and were obtained by solid phase synthesis. Remarkably,
these molecules are able to epimerize, and this phenomenon involves
a change of configuration at just one of several chiral centers present
in the molecule (Scheme 1). As observed by Adamczeski et al.,30 epimerization occurred preferentially at H6 with DKPs containing
proline in experiments where d-prolyl–l-norvaline
went from +91 to +81 in alkaline solution (0.01 M NaOH in 1:1 v/v
H2O/MeOH) in 24 h. The decreasing positive [α]D values indicated the formation of l-prolyl–l-norvaline, which is negative. Epimerization occurs preferentially
at positions 6 and 9, and it was observed that standard cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu) epimerization was larger (21%),
followed by that of cyclo(l-Pro–d-Leu) (18%),
and that of cyclo(d-Pro–l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro–d-Leu) (both 11%). The cis enantiomers
(cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro–d-Leu)) were harder than the trans enantiomers (cyclo(l-Pro–d-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro–l-Leu)) to separate, leading to a long chromatographic run (85 min).
Despite the epimerization of the synthetic standards, it was possible
to determine the retention times of each stereoisomer based on the
major peak. The retention times were 64.197 min for cyclo(d-Pro–d-Leu), 64.474 min for cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu), 69.592 min for cyclo(l-Pro–d-Leu), and 70.834 min for cyclo(d-Pro–l-Leu)
(Table 2).

c Relative to C23H48 peak.

For more reliable and reproducible standardizations we used a RRT,
which overcomes the uncertainty of the identity of the analyzed substance.35 Thus, the four isomers of cyclo(Pro–Leu)
were injected with a tricosane standard (C23H48), and the calculation of RRT was performed, giving rise to the data
in Table 2.

With
this chromatographical separation, we could monitor the absolute
configuration of the cyclo(Pro–Leu) produced by these microorganisms. C. sakazakii produced higher amounts of cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu) compared to cyclo(d-Pro–d-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro–l-Leu), whereas B. cereus produced cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu) and cyclo(d-Pro–l-Leu). The
mixed culture showed that both cultures produced the same molecules,
which are depicted in Table 3. The presence of the same enantiomers in different bacterial
cultures can be attributed to the natural use of d-amino
acids by microorganisms, or to epimerization. The epimerization percentages
of C. sakazakii and the co-culture
were similar to those of the cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu) standard (14 and 17%), indicating a possible epimerization
of the C. sakazakii cyclo(Pro–Leu)
and not a natural occurrence.

C. sakazakii	86	0	12	2	–21	
co-culture	83	0	12	5	–27	
We observed that (1) the major stereoisomer
in the bacterial extracts was cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu), and that (2) there was similar epimerization for the standards
and the natural products. Therefore, the cross-talking signal responsible
for a second communication system between C. sakazakii and B. cereus is cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu).

Other DKPs
The presence of cyclo(Pro–Leu)
in
the cultures dominated over other polar molecules. However, other
DKPs occurred in the extracts (Figure 2), that is, cyclo(Val–Val) and cyclo(Pro–Leu)
in the B. cereus culture, and cyclo(Val–Val),
cyclo(Pro–Leu), cyclo(Leu–Leu), cyclo(Phe–Val),
cyclo(Phe–Leu), and cyclo(Phe–Pro) in the C. sakazakii culture and co-culture. The fragmentation
patterns are in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Secondary DKPs found in the extract of C. sakazakii and B. cereus.

DKPs are able to modulate communication (QS) in microorganism
cultures.
DKPs and short chain AHLs bind to the same regulatory sites allowing
the co-sharing of an ecological niche by different species of microorganisms.17

Conclusions
DKPs are important chemical
signals in the communication between C. sakazakii and B. cereus. Acyl-HSL is one of
the C. sakazakii communication signals
that is easily destroyed by the action of
other microorganisms (i.e., B. cereus). In contrast, cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu) produced
as a second mechanism of communication is not destroyed by Bacillus sp. enzymes and is a common signal between C. sakazakii and B. cereus. Finally, this explains why they coexist in the same industrial
environment. The absolute configuration cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu) was determined by chiral GC, which is a new tool for
the absolute configuration of the four cyclo(Pro–Leu) isomers
as an alternative to the joint application of NMR and Marfey’s
method. Further studies will evaluate the biological activity of these
compounds.

Experimental Section
Unless stated otherwise, the reactions
were conducted under a N2 atmosphere using reagent-grade
solvents. All commercially
available reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Germany
and were used without further purification.

Culture Conditions
B. cereus and C. sakazakii were cultivated
at 30 °C in nutrient agar (NA) (“Lab-Lemco” Powder
0.1%, yeast extract 0.2%, peptone 0.5%, NaCl 0.5%, agar 1.5%, and
initial pH 7.4) and grown at 30 °C at 200 rpm in a Luria–Bertani
growth medium (tryptone 1%, yeast extract 0.5%, NaCl 1%, and initial
pH 7.0) for 24 h.

2,5-Diketopiperazine Extraction
C. sakazakii’s 2,5-Diketopiperazine
(ES-DKP)
C. sakazakii CCT4821
was inoculated to LB medium (1 L) and was incubated for 24 h at 30
°C. The cells were removed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for
30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was extracted with ethyl acetate
(3 × 300 mL), and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure
(Büchi Rotavapor R-200). The residue (80 mg) was submitted
to column chromatography on silica gel and eluted with a hexane/ethyl
acetate gradient. The fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography
(TLC) and GC–MS. Fractions displaying characteristic DKP fragmentation
[cyclo(Val–Val):m/z 156, 113, 72; cyclo(Leu–Leu):m/z 170, 86; cyclo(Pro–Leu):m/z 154, 86, 70; cyclo(Phe–Val):m/z 246, 127, 91; cyclo(Phe–Leu):m/z 204, 169, 141, 91; cyclo(Phe–Pro):m/z 153, 125, 91, 70] and adequate
purity were pooled, and the solvent was evaporated. The major molecule
found was cyclo(Pro–Leu), the only product completely isolated,
which yielded 1.2 mg from the C. sakazakii culture.

The same procedure was repeated for B. cereus CCT4060 and the co-culture of B. cereus and C. sakazakii, yielding 90 and 70 mg of brute extract and 0.8 and 3.1 mg of the
pure DKP fraction, respectively.

Enantiomer Standards Synthesis
The production of synthetic
diketopiperazine cyclo(l-Pro–l-Leu), cyclo(l-Pro–d-Leu), cyclo(d-Pro–l-Leu), and cyclo(d-Pro–d-Leu) was
carried out by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) with the Fmoc
(9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) strategy. A total of 100 mg of Wang
resin (Sigma-Aldrich) already coupled with l- or d-leucine-Fmoc-OH (0.7 mmol/gresin) was submitted to a
3 mL dichloromethane (DCM) bath for 20 min for activation. Next, 3
mL of 4-methylpiperidine was poured into the reaction flask and stirred
for 20 min, twice. After vacuum filtration, the resin was washed with
3 mL of methanol and 3 mL of DCM, three times each. The solvents were
removed with vacuum filtration.

l- or d-Proline-Fmoc-OH
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the system in 3:1 mmol equivalency in
relation to l-leucine-Fmoc. 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate
(Sigma-Aldrich) and N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide
(DIC), dissolved in 3 mL of dimethylformamide, were added to the system
in 6:1 proportions relative to the quantity of amino acid coupled
to the resin (mmol). The system was stirred for 4 h at room temperature,
and afterwards, it was vacuum filtered. The procedure of deprotection
of proline was repeated to assure the availability of the amino terminal
for spontaneous cyclization.

After vacuum filtration to remove
the reactants, 3 mL of the cleavage
cocktail (95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% triisopropylsilane, and 2.5%
distilled water) was added to the system and stirred for 4 h at room
temperature. Filtration and evaporation (Büchi Rotavapor R-200)
produced a colorless oil (24 mg) that was dissolved in methanol and
analyzed by GC–MS.

Identification and Structure Elucidation
GC–Mass
Spectrometry (GC–MS)
GC–MS
was performed with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Santa Clara,
CA) coupled with a Hewlett-Packard 5973 mass spectrometer, equipped
with a capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm
film thickness) coated with silica in splitless mode. The injector
temperature was 270 °C, and the carrier gas (He) flow was 1 mL/min.
One microliter samples (1 mg/mL) in ethyl acetate were injected into
the GC–MS. The oven temperature program was as follows: initial
temperature of 150 °C for 3 min; increasing the temperature from
150 to 275 °C at 25 °C/min; and maintaining the temperature
of 275 °C for 10 min. The MS conditions included an ionization
energy of 0.7 kV. Analysis was conducted in full scan mode (m/z 40–400). Spectral interpretation
was aided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
05 spectral library stored in the GC–MS controller unit.

1H NMR and 13C NMR
1H NMR
spectra were recorded on Bruker spectrometers (400 MHz). Chemical
shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the residual
solvent peaks (CD3OD δ 3.30 and 4.84 ppm). 1H NMR coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz
(Hz), and multiplicity is indicated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), qt (quintet), m (multiplet), brs (broad
singlet), and dd (doublet of doublet). 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 100 MHz, and all chemical shift values are reported
in ppm, using the signal at δ 49.15 ppm as the internal reference.

Absolute Configuration of Compounds
A chiral Lipodex-E
fused silica capillary column (octakis-(3-O-butyryl-2,6-di-O-n-pentyl)-γ-cyclodextrin) (28 m
length, 0.25 mm I.D., film thickness of 12 μm) was installed
on an Agilent GC-FID Model 6850. The run started at 120 °C for
5 min and then it increased 1 °C/min to 180 °C and stood
for 20 min. The four enantiomeric standards, as well as the samples
of each culture and co-culture, were injected at 1 mg/mL. The enantiomers
were also injected separately to determine the retention time for
comparison with those of the natural ones to determine their absolute
configurations. RRT was obtained by co-injecting tricosane (C23H48, RT 68.649) with the standards and calculated
using eq 1. 1  

Optical Rotation
Optical rotations were measured at
20 °C on a PerkinElmer 341 polarimeter at 589 nm using PerkinElmer
10-mm cuvettes. The concentrations (c) are expressed
in g/100 mL.
