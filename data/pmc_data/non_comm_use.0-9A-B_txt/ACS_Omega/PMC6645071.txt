Magnesium
dichloride and titanium tetrachloride are key components
in heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta olefin polymerization catalysis.
We have determined the preferred binding modes of titanium tetrachloride
on magnesium dichloride clusters at the M06-2X level of theory, thus
accounting for dispersion. A systematic study was carried out to locate
the lowest energy isomers of (MgCl2)n(TiCl4)m complexes.
Altogether ca. 1000 complexes with n ranging from
1 to 19 and m from 1 to 13 were studied. In line
with the previous literature, the results consistently show that adsorption
of TiCl4 onto MgCl2 preferably leads to octahedral
six-coordination for both Mg and Ti atoms. This can be achieved by
mononuclear binding of TiCl4 and binuclear binding of Ti2Cl8 on (110) and (104) surfaces of MgCl2, respectively. The preferred octahedral six-coordination is also
achieved by binding of TiCl4 on defect sites, of which
the most striking example is trinuclear binding mode at corners of
the clusters. Overall, the results highlight the relevance of multinuclear
binding of TiCl4 on MgCl2.

Introduction
Heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta
(ZN) catalysis is currently
the main technique for industrial production of polyolefins.1,2 The current state-of-the-art ZN catalysts are composed of MgCl2, TiCl4, and a Lewis base (internal donor).3 Contacting the ternary mixture with a trialkyl
aluminum cocatalyst and another and Lewis base (external donor) yields
the catalytically active species with reduced oxidation states of
Ti.2,4 Each of these components play a significant role
in the polymerization process, though their precise functions are
not fully understood and the structure of the catalyst is ill-defined
because of a high complexity of the overall system.1−3

The catalytic
reactions take place on the surfaces of the MgCl2 support.5,6 The bulk MgCl2 is a
crystalline layered material, which exists in three polymorphs: rhombohedral
α-MgCl2, hexagonally closed-packed β-MgCl2, and rotationally distorted δ-MgCl2. The
layers are held together by dispersion and are composed of octahedral
six-coordinated Mg atoms bound to three-coordinate Cl atoms (Figure 1A).7−10 Lateral cut of the MgCl2 sheets exposes catalytically
relevant (104) and (110) surfaces with five- and four-coordinate Mg
atoms, respectively (Figure 1B),11 which adsorb and coadsorb
TiCl4, aluminum alkyls, and Lewis bases.12−20 The (110) surface is less stable than the (104) surface because
of the lower coordination numbers of surface Mg atoms,18,19,21 but adsorption of other catalyst
components may reverse the stability order in favor of (110).22,23 Reactions taking place on the surface eventually lead to the formation
of active sites for olefin polymerization.7,19,24−29

atoms are shown in yellow, green, and white, respectively.

Little is known about the reactions at atomic-level
detail; there
is not even consensus on how TiCl4 adsorbs on the MgCl2 support in the absence of other catalyst components. The
binding modes have been widely studied by quantum chemical calculations,
though, with varying results and conclusions.10,11,30−36 Four commonly discussed binding modes are illustrated in Figure 1C. Adopting a previously
defined naming convention, which specifies the coordination number
of Ti followed by the MgCl2 surface, these are 4-110, 5-104, 6-110, and 6-104.7 In addition, 5-110 mode has been
proposed but later questioned.11,37 Spectroscopic experiments
indicate octahedral six-coordination of Ti atoms,21,38 which also rules out the 4-110 and 5-104
modes. Alongside with 6-110 and 6-104, defects
on the surfaces generate environments allowing for the octahedral
six-coordination.36,39−43

Octahedral six-coordination of Ti has been
widely considered to
signal mononuclear 6-110 binding or mononuclear binding
on a defect site of MgCl2.40 The mononuclear binding is generally concluded to be favored over
binuclear octahedral 6-104 binding based on the weaker
binding energy of the latter. However, as has been shown recently,
this is a biased conclusion, omitting the higher reactivity of the
(110) surface.7 In a systematic computational
study reported herein, we determine the preferred binding modes of
TiCl4 on selected (MgCl2)n clusters up to n = 19 based on thermodynamic
stabilities of the products rather than binding energies. As it turns
out, multinuclear binding modes of TiCl4 are highly relevant
on the (104) surface and possibly on defect sites of MgCl2 as well.

Results and Discussion
Binding of TiCl4 on (MgCl2)n Clusters (n = 1–4)
We begin by a systematic and thorough exploration
of the binding
of TiCl4 on (MgCl2)n, where n = 1–4, to form (MgCl2)n–(TiCl4)m complexes. The (MgCl2)n clusters were obtained from a previous work by Luhtanen, et
al.8 Here and in all that follows, all
theoretically possible structures were initially constructed for each
cluster followed by structure optimization. This resulted in optimization
of 31 (MgCl2)–(TiCl4)m complexes, where m = 1–5, 63 (MgCl2)2–(TiCl4)m complexes, where m = 1–6, 144 (MgCl2)3–(TiCl4)m complexes, where m = 1–8, and 303
(MgCl2)4–(TiCl4)m complexes, where m = 1–8.

lowest energy structures of (MgCl2)n–(TiCl4)m, where n = 1–4 and m = 1–8. Mg,
Cl, and Ti atoms are shown in yellow, green, and
white, respectively.

The located lowest energy structure of each combination of n and m is shown in Figure 2.
We use the nomenclature (n,m) to
specify the number of MgCl2 (n) and TiCl4 (m) units in the presentation and discussion
of the results. The driving force for the reactions is the tendency
of both Mg and Ti to attain octahedral six-coordination. In the case
of monomeric MgCl2, this is achieved for Mg, as well as
for each Ti, upon binding of five TiCl4 molecules (1,5),
thus leaving no further reactive sites. The (MgCl2)2 dimer attains octahedral six-coordination for the Mg atoms
at (2,6), the trimer at (3,8), and the tetramer at (4,6).

Electronic
energies and Gibbs energies for the reaction (MgCl2)n + (TiCl4)m → (MgCl2)n–(TiCl4)m calculated
by the M06-2X/TZVP method44,45 are given in Table 1. Energies improve
along gradual saturation of the (MgCl2)n clusters by the TiCl4 molecules. However, Gibbs
energies show that entropy plays a major role in the process, preventing
full saturation of the small clusters. For the monomer, dimer, and
trimer, the minimum in Gibbs energy was found at m = 2, resulting in chain structures with four-coordinate magnesiums,
terminated by five-coordinate titaniums at each end. The tetramer
shows a distinctly different behavior. It finds the minimum in Gibbs
energy at m = 6, where each Mg atom and four out
of six Ti atoms obtain octahedral six-coordination in resemblance
to the basal MgCl2 surface.

To demonstrate the importance of
dispersion in arriving at these
conclusions, we report the reaction Gibbs energies in Table 1 also by the popular PBE0 method46,47 lacking description for dispersive interactions. In line with previous
studies,7,48 PBE0 predicts much weaker binding between
magnesium dichloride and titanium tetrachloride, particularly at large
values of m. Consequently, the PBE0 method ends up
favoring the (4,2) structure for the tetramer with two four-coordinate
magnesiums, in resemblance to the (110) surface of MgCl2.

Binding of TiCl4 on (MgCl2)7
On the basis of the above results, considering dispersion
by the M06-2X method, one could also envisage that MgCl2 clusters larger than the tetramer favor full coverage by TiCl4 to obtain octahedral six-coordination for Mg, which is also
possible for the Ti atoms. We first show that this is the case for
the (MgCl2)7 heptamer, which is the simplest
hexagonal structure with one saturated octahedral magnesium and six
unsaturated surface magnesiums. The latter are the reactive sites,
two of them having five-coordination and four four-coordination, similar
to the (104) and (110) MgCl2 surfaces, respectively.

Altogether 141 (7,m) complexes, where m = 1–9, were optimized. The located lowest energy structure
of each combination of n and m is
shown in Figure 3 with
energies and Gibbs energies for the reaction (MgCl2)7 + (TiCl4)m →
(MgCl2)7–(TiCl4)m given in Table 2. The calculated Gibbs energies show that the reactions
are much more exergonic for the heptamer than for the monomer to the
tetramer discussed above. The first TiCl4 molecule makes
a bidentate binding to the more reactive four-coordinate surface magnesiums,
and upon reaction of three TiCl4 molecules, all surface
magnesiums reach five-coordination. The reaction continues further
until each magnesium attains octahedral six-coordination, which is
reached at m = 7. However, because of the preference
of also titanium for attaining octahedral six-coordination, the reaction
continues further until (7,8), where the six-coordination of each
Ti is obtained by trinuclear binding of TiCl4. We are not
aware of any previous reports of trinuclear TiCl4 on MgCl2, possibly because the calculations have typically dealt with
idealized (104) and (110) MgCl2 surfaces. Formation at
a corner suggests that the trinuclear binding mode may be relevant
at defect sites of the MgCl2 surface.

Extension to Larger (MgCl2)n Clusters (n = 14, 19)
As a first
step to evaluate how the above results on small MgCl2 clusters
translate to MgCl2 surfaces, we turn the attention to two
isomers of (MgCl2)14, which are adopted from
a previous work, including their namings.23 The pipe and diamond isomers of (MgCl2)14 provide
simplified models for the (110) and (104) surfaces of MgCl2, respectively (Figure 4 top). Both models contain 4 octahedral six-coordinated Mg atoms
that do not participate in reaction with TiCl4 and 10 reactive
surface Mg atoms, of which 6 are four-coordinate and 4 are five-coordinate
in the pipe model, whereas 6 are five-coordinate and 4 are four-coordinate
in the diamond model. The pipe isomer is 23.0 kJ mol–1 lower in energy, indicating that the adjacent five-coordinate magnesiums
introduce certain strain to the diamond isomer because of its small
size. For comparison, we, therefore, also include a larger model for
the representation of the (104) surfaces, hexagonal (MgCl2)19 cluster, which has 7 octahedral six-coordinated magnesiums
and 12 reactive surface magnesiums, of which 8 are five-coordinate
(Figure 5 top). The
(MgCl2)19 cluster is 12.2 kJ mol–1 per MgCl2 unit lower in energy than the diamond isomer
of (MgCl2)14, indicating reduced strain, and
10.6 kJ mol–1 per MgCl2 unit lower in
energy than the pipe isomer of (MgCl2)14 because
of the higher average coordination numbers.

for pipe and diamond models. Mg, Cl, and
Ti atoms are shown in yellow, green, and white, respectively.

Figure 5 Optimized lowest energy structures of (MgCl2)19–(TiCl4)m, where m = 10–13. Mg, Cl, and Ti atoms
are shown in yellow,
green, and white, respectively.

Because of thousands of possible configurations for TiCl4 binding on these larger clusters, we limit the number of
bound TiCl4 molecules to the domain of full saturation
of surfaces, that
is, m = 8–11 for (MgCl2)14 and m = 10–13 for (MgCl2)19. This narrows down the studied (14,m) complexes
to 204 and (19,m) complexes to 147. The located lowest
energy structures are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 with energies
and Gibbs energies for the reaction (MgCl2)n + (TiCl4)m → (MgCl2)n–(TiCl4)m given in Table 3.

In each case, TiCl4 adsorption continues until all magnesium
atoms have reached octahedral six-coordination, which takes place
at m = 10 and m = 12 for n = 14 and n = 19, respectively. Comparison
of pipe and diamond isomers of n = 14 shows that
the latter binds TiCl4 much more strongly (−337.9
kJ mol–1 vs −234.7 kJ mol–1). One could argue that this is because the pipe isomer is more stable
and hence less reactive than the diamond isomer, but the stability
difference is only a minor contribution as is revealed by comparison
of the (14,10) isomers (Figure 6), where the diamond isomer is favored by 84.4 kJ mol–1 in Gibbs energy.

Figure 6 Comparison of pipe (top) and diamond (bottom)
isomers of (MgCl2)14–(TiCl4)10 with
labeling of the (104) and (110) surfaces and identification of the
binding modes of TiCl4 (A–E).

Five binding modes of TiCl4 can be identified for the
two isomers of (14,10), as illustrated in Figure 6. Mononuclear binding on the (110) surface
(A) and binuclear binding on the (104) surface (B) are the dominant binding modes resulting in the preferred
octahedral six-coordination of the Ti atoms. The pipe isomer features
a mononuclear binding mode C, which is analogous to the 5-104 binding mode (Figure 1C). Yet another binding mode (D) is found
at a corner resembling defect site. With two bridging chlorides, D is analogous to the 4-110 binding mode but
is stabilized by the extra terminal Cl at the corner of the pristine
(MgCl2)14 cluster, thus reaching five-coordination.
Similarly, in the diamond isomer, the terminal Cl increases the coordination
number of the mononuclear TiCl4 at the defect site from
five to six (E), ending up with the optimal octahedral
six-coordination for each titanium. Note that E is analogous
to 5-104 on the ideal (104) surface. Octahedral six-coordination
is the primary reason for the diamond isomer of (14,10) being thermodynamically
favored over the pipe isomer.

Moving to n =
19, the minimum in Gibbs energy
is located at (19,12) with octahedral six-coordination of each magnesium.
Adsorption of 12 TiCl4 molecules to saturate n = 19 is less exergonic than the adsorption of 10 TiCl4 molecules to saturate the diamond isomer of n =
14 (Table 3). As Figure 7 illustrates, (19,12)
cannot attain the optimal octahedral six-coordination for each Ti
because it would lead to a wrong overall stoichiometry. Consequently,
two of the adsorbed TiCl4 molecules are forced to adopt
monodentate binding of TiCl4, leading to unfavorable four-coordinate
surface titaniums.

TiCl4. Bottom: Removal of the two terminal chlorines from
(MgCl2)19 yields optimal binding modes of TiCl4 for
each site but has a wrong overall stoichiometry.

Figure 8 summarizes
the relevant binding modes of TiCl4 on MgCl2 based on this work. The primary binding modes on pristine (110)
and (104) surfaces are mononuclear A and binuclear B, respectively, both binding modes providing Ti atoms with
octahedral six-coordination closely resembling the structure of the
basal MgCl2 layer. Octahedral six-coordination is also
attained by trinuclear binding of TiCl4 at a corner site
having four-coordinate Mg and by mononuclear binding on a (104) surface
site having an extra terminal Cl. Other binding modes (C, D, and F) can only be present at environments
not allowing for octahedral six-coordination because of the immediate
surroundings.

Figure 8 Relevant binding modes of TiCl4 on MgCl2. A and B are mononuclear and binuclear
binding
on the pristine (110) and (104) surfaces, respectively. E is a bidentate TiCl4 binding resulting in the optimal
six-coordination of Ti. C, D, and F are TiCl4 bindings at MgCl2 environments
that do not allow octahedral six-coordination of Ti.

The calculated reaction Gibbs energy (−337.9
kJ mol–1, Table 3) to form the diamond isomer of (14,10), which features
octahedral
six-coordination of each Ti with domination of the binuclear binding
mode (B), corresponds to average adsorption Gibbs energy
of −33.8 kJ mol–1 per TiCl4. For
(19,12), the average adsorption Gibbs energy decreases to −26.3
kJ mol–1 per TiCl4. The drop is contributed
by two factors as follows: (1) the presence of unsaturated Ti in (19,12)
and (2) higher strain and hence higher reactivity of (MgCl2)14. A logical assumption from the latter factor is that
beyond n = 19, adsorption Gibbs energies per TiCl4 continue decreasing as a function of n.
The assumption can be confirmed by comparison to a previous study
employing infinitely large periodic models, where the calculations
have been carried out at the same level of theory (M06-2X/TZVP) and
where, though, the TZVP basis set was slightly different because it
was optimized for periodic calculations.7 Full coverage of the infinite pristine (104) surface by binuclear
TiCl4 adsorption (6-104) gives adsorption
Gibbs energy of −16.0 kJ mol–1 per TiCl4, which is roughly the value toward which the (n,m) clusters dominant in the (104) surface converge
as a function of n. Further, to provide an estimate
for the Gibbs energies of the reaction at condensed phase, we use
a procedure, justified and employed previously, of multiplication
of the TΔS term by 2/3 to
correct for solvation entropy.49−53 The results are given in the right column of Table 3 (ΔrG-c/M06-2X).
The correction does not affect the preferred (n,m) configuration, but it systematically increases the strength
of TiCl4 adsorption—on average by 19 kJ mol–1 per TiCl4.

A further question of
interest is if TiCl4 binds strong
enough to cut the growth of MgCl2 and thus affect the preferred
size of the (n,m) clusters. In this
regard, n = 7 versus n = 14 provides
a useful comparison. The energy of the reaction (MgCl2)7(TiCl4)8 + (MgCl2)7(TiCl4)8 → (MgCl2)14(TiCl4)10 (diamond) + 6TiCl4 is
14.5 kJ mol–1, thus favoring (7,8) over (14,10).
However, entropy reverses the reaction clearly in favor of (14,10)
with ΔrG = −274.0 kJ mol–1 (or ΔrG-c = −187.3
kJ mol–1 with the above correction for solvation
entropy). An alternative way to shed light on this is to consider n/m = 1:1 stoichiometric compositions as
a function of size (Table 4). The stabilities continue improving as a function of size,
indicating that the adsorption of TiCl4 is not strong enough
to affect the growth of MgCl2 crystallites.

The same conclusion can be
drawn from infinitely large periodic
models based on previous work, where both 6-104 and 6-110 surfaces lie above the fully saturated basal MgCl2 layer in Gibbs energy (but not in electronic energy),7 and thus, thermodynamics prefers MgCl2 to grow in any direction rather than adsorbed TiCl4 cutting
the growth. The situation becomes markedly different in the presence
of internal donors, which can bind MgCl2 much stronger
and which can hence be used for controlling the shape and size of
the (MgCl2)n–adsorbate
complexes.54,55

Conclusions
Using
the M06-2X/TZVP method and thus accounting for dispersion,
we have carried out a systematic computational study on (MgCl2)n(TiCl4)m clusters (n = 1–19, m = 1–13) to locate the lowest energy structures
of the clusters as a function of n and m and to determine the preferred binding modes of titanium tetrachloride
on magnesium dichloride.

With the exception of the smallest
(MgCl2)n clusters (n = 1–3), (TiCl4)m adsorbs on (MgCl2)n in such a way that each Mg atom attains
octahedral six-coordination, which is in line with previous experiments
and computations. Optimally, the adsorption simultaneously results
in octahedral six-coordination of each Ti atom so that the (MgCl2)n(TiCl4)m clusters resemble the basal MgCl2 surface.
However, the optimal scenario is not always possible because of the
immediate surroundings of the adsorption site and stoichiometric requirements,
leading to coordination numbers of less than six under such circumstances.

The results indicate that multinuclear binding modes of TiCl4 are more relevant than those that have been considered previously.
This becomes evident from the overall structural characteristics of
the lowest energy (MgCl2)n(TiCl4)m clusters, which are abundant
in binuclear binding mode on sites resembling the (104) surface and
even feature trinuclear binding mode at a corner resembling defect
site. The preference for multinuclear binding is further supported
by comparison of the relative stabilities of isomers featuring different
sites.

Theoretical Methods
All structures were fully optimized
by the M06-2X metahybrid GGA
functional of the Minnesota 06 series,44 in combination with TZVP basis set by Ahlrichs and coworkers.45 The M06 functionals have turned out as the method
of choice for systems involving dispersive interactions arising from
metals bridged by halide and alkyl groups,48,56−58 and we have previously used the method for describing
MgCl2- and TiCl4-containing systems analogous
to the systems reported here.7,59,60 Vibrational frequencies were calculated by the harmonic approximation
to verify the structures as true minima in the potential energy surface
and to obtain Gibbs energies, which were calculated at T = 298 K and p = 1 atm. Condensed phase Gibbs energies
were estimated from the reported gas-phase calculations by multiplication
of the TΔS term of G = H – TΔS by 2/3 as suggested and employed in the previous literature.49−53 All calculations were carried out by Gaussian 09.61
