Flexible electronics has received
widespread concern and research. As a most-fundamental step and component,
polymer metallization to introduce conductive electrode is crucial
in successful establishment and application of flexible and stretchable
electronic system. Ionic polymer–metal composite (IPMC) is
such an attractive flexible mechanical sensor with significant advantages
of passive and space-discriminative capability. Generally, the IPMC
sensor is fabricated by the electroless plating method to form structure
of ionic polymer membrane sandwiched with two metallic electrodes.
In order to obtain high-quality interface adhesion and conductivity
between polymer and metal, the plating process for IPMC sensor is
usually time-consuming and uncontrollable and has low reproducibility,
which make it difficult to use in practice and in large-scale. Here,
a manufacturable method and equipment with short processing time and
high reproducibility for fabricating IPMC sensors by in situ plasma
etching and magnetron sputtering depositing on flexible substrates
is developed. First, the new method shortens the fabrication period
greatly from 2 weeks to 2 h to obtain IPMC sensors with sizes up to
9 cm × 9 cm or arrays in various patterns. Second, the integrated
operation ensures all sample batch stability and performance repeatability.
In a typical IPMC sensor, nearly 200 mV potential signal due to ion
redistribution induced by bending strain under 1.6% can be produced
without any external power supply, which is much higher than the traditional
electroless plating sensor. This work verified that the in situ plasma
etching and magnetron sputtering deposition could significantly increase
the interface and surface conductivity of the flexible devices, resulting
in the present high sensitivity as well as linear correlation with
strain of the IPMC sensor. Therefore, this introduced method is scalable
and believed to be used to metalize flexible substrates with different
metals, providing a new route to large-scale fabrication of flexible
devices for potential wearable applications in real-time monitoring
human motion and human–machine interaction.

Introduction
In order to overcome
application problems of the electronic system in the large deformation
and arbitrarily curved surfaces, flexible electronics that is compatible
with movable parts has been driven to the advent and growth over the
last few decades. Flexible electronics create a wide range of revolutionary
functional devices, including sensors, actuators, robots, and other
electronic devices that are bendable, curved, and even stretchable.1−9 As the most basic component of electronics, the thin-film conductive
electrode of polymer metallization fabrication has become a key part
of the successful application of flexible and stretchable electronic
systems. Recently, ionic polymer–metal composites (IPMCs) have
extensively been studied for their excellent properties and potential
applications in the areas of science and technology as flexible sensors.10−16 An IPMC sample typically consists of a thin ion-exchange membrane
(e.g., Nafion) and metallic electrodes on both surfaces with a noble
metal.17 Also, IPMC can induce voltages
by bending or stretching the membrane, which makes IPMC an ideal flexible
sensor. Compared with electronic sensors,18−20 these IPMC
sensors show significant advantages of no power supply and the ability
to distinguish bending directions.

IPMC sensors are generally
fabricated by electroless plating21 to
achieve polymer metallization on the flexible Nafion membrane. Polymer
metallization use conventional conductive materials, such as rigid
metal nanoparticles (mainly including Cu, Ag, or Au) on polymer film
to realize flexibility and stretchability. However, these conductive
materials may not be suitable for flexible electronics. The flexible
polymeric material (from fractions to hundreds of MPa) and the hard
electrode material (from tenths to hundreds of GPa)22 have the large Young’s modulus mismatch, which causes
electrode cracking, stripping, and delamination during multicycle
bending and further limits the lifetime and the bending stability
of the IPMC sensors.23 Thus, in view of
applications, fabrication of compliant and well-adherent electrodes
that are closely integrated with the polymer layer is crucial.24 Besides, fabrication of IPMC sensors still remains
a big challenge mainly because the traditional electroless plating
method is manual operation. This process not only consumes a long
period, but it also has many uncontrollable factors. Most importantly,
reliability of manual operation is not strong, resulting in low reproducibility.
What’s more, they have difficulty for batch production. Therefore,
in order to develop production techniques of industrial interest,
a non-manual preparation method with high efficiency should be developed.

Here, in order to solve the aforementioned problems, we develop
a manufacturable and integrative method and equipment with short processing
time and high reproducibility for fabricating IPMC sensors by in situ
plasma etching and magnetron sputtering depositing on flexible substrates.
Some literature studies have only used plasma to etch Nafion membrane.
Omosebi and Besser25 used plasma to etch
the Nafion membrane for multiple electrochemical applications. Van
Nguyen26 etched with argon on the surface
Nafion membrane and investigated its performance in a proton-exchange
membrane fuel cell. Also, some literature studies have only reported
to prepare IPMC using magnetron sputtering. Zhou27 sputter-coated a gold seed layer of 0.4 μm thickness.
Siripong28 employed sputter coating for
deposition of gold on Nafion for fast and economical fabrication of
IPMC. Thus, we place two devices into a single chamber to rapidly
and large-scale prepare IPMC. Plasma etching is a potentially attractive
method to control polymer surface modification without affecting the
bulk properties of the material.29 Plasma
treatment depends heavily on the adjustment of parameters such as
power and treatment duration.30 We can
quantify and repeat the degree of etching with defined parameters.
Magnetron sputtering has developed rapidly over the last decades to
the point where it has become established as the process of choice
for the deposition of a wide range of industrially important coatings
on plastic substrates at room temperature.31 For equipment, plasma etching filament and magnetron sputtering
target are installed in one chamber and the control panel was operated
to achieve the integrative fabrication. Plasma etching increases the
roughness of the intermediate layer surface to improve the adhesion
of the electrode layer. Magnetron sputtering deposits silver particles
to metallize Nafion membrane. Silver is considered as a high conductive
material and is much cheaper than gold, platinum, or other precious
metals.

The integrative preparation method provides the possibility
of batch and reproducible production of flexible IPMC sensors. First,
the new method shortens the fabrication period greatly from 2 weeks
to 2 h to obtain IPMC sensors with sizes up to 9 cm × 9 cm or
arrays in various patterns. Second, the integrated operation ensures
all sample batch stability and performance repeatability. In a typical
IPMC sensor, nearly 200 mV potential signal under a bending-induced
strain as small as 1.6% can be produced without any external power
supply, which is 63 times higher than that of the sensor fabricated
by traditional electroless plating. We verified that the in situ plasma
etching and magnetron sputtering depositing could significantly increase
the interface and surface conductivity of the flexible devices. Plasma
etching processing improves the degree and uniformity of etching on
the Nafion film surface, resulting in a much lower equivalent series
resistance. The magnetron sputtering-based sensor shows a good interface
contact between the electrolyte and electrode as well as excellent
electronic conductivity of the electrode material. Moreover, this
flexible IPMC sensor has better bending cycle stability and high sensitivity
as well as linear correlation with strain. Then, we mainly optimize
the parameters of etching power, etching time and magnetron sputtering,
sputtering time, sputtering power, working pressure, and working argon
flow rate to get an IPMC sensor with excellent performance. In a word,
this introduced method is scalable and believed to be used to metalize
flexible substrates with different metals, providing a new route to
large-scale fabrication of flexible devices for potential wearable
applications in real-time monitoring human motion and human–machine
interaction.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization
The equipment used to fabricate the flexible IPMC sensor is shown
in Figure 1a. The sample
holder (①), the filament (③) for plasma etching, and
the magnetron sputtering target (④) are installed in the chamber
of the equipment. The equipment is also equipped with a mechanical
handle (②) for inverting the sample on the sample holder, which
ensures that both sides of the sample are plasma-etched and magnetron
sputtering-coated with silver particles to achieve integrative fabrication.
In the fabrication process, we only need to operate and set the plasma
etching and magnetron sputtering parameters on the control panel instead
of manual operation, which is a simple and controllable process. A
schematic representation of the fabrication process of the flexible
IPMC sensor is presented in Figure 1b. Before plasma etching, the Nafion substrate (suitable
for different sizes and array pattern) is fixed on the hollow part
of rotatable sample holder allowing the rotation of the substrate
along a direction, which assures sample uniformity of etching and
metalizing over the entire surface. The picture of simple holder is
shown in Figure S1. Then, plasma etching
with defined energy is used to control Nafion membrane surface modification.
After completing, the holder is turned over 180° by the mechanical
handle, and the opposite side of the Nafion polymer is processed.
Finally, magnetron sputtering deposited silver particles on the metallic
Nafion polymer. Once the electrode with appropriate conductivity has
been deposited, the holder is turned over 180° by the mechanical
handle, and the opposite side of the Nafion polymer is deposited with
silver particles. The details can be found in the Experimental Methods section.

the fabrication process of the IPMC sensor.

The pictures of fabricated IPMC sensors are shown in Figure 2. The IPMC sensor
is flexible and can be easily bent. What’s more, the specular
IPMC sensor surface is shiny and bright; in other words, the fabricated
silver electrode layer has very high quality. We can obtain IPMC sensors
with size up to 9 cm × 9 cm (Figure 2a) or arrays in various patterns (Figure 2b–d). Moreover,
mechanical operation ensures high performance of each batch samples.

of the fabricated IPMC sensors. (a) Pictures of large-scale IPMC sensors.
(b–d) Pictures of various array patterns of IPMC sensors.

Then, the observation of microscopic
morphology of the IPMC sensor is done by using an electron microscope. Figure 3a displays the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of the IPMC sensor surface, which
clearly shows the homogeneous silver layer coated on the surface of
the polymer membrane layer and the silver nanoparticles are closely
integrative, having a diameter between 50 and 160 nm. Figure 3b displays a detail of the
cross-sectional SEM image of the IPMC sensor, which clearly indicates
that the silver nanoparticle layer and the Nafion membrane interlayer
are well-interconnected. The structure benefits the cyclic stability
of the sensor. In the inset of Figure 3c, the Nafion membrane interlayer with an average thickness
of 183 μm is sandwiched between two silver electrodes, forming
the IPMC sensor. In order to verify the distribution of the Ag electrode
layer in the IPMC sensor, Figure 3c shows the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
signal, which is collected from the vertical cross section of the
IPMC in the inset SEM image. Ag is mainly concentrated on both sides
of IPMC. Moreover, typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder diffraction
pattern of the surface layer of the IPMC sensor is shown in Figure 3d. The peaks at 38.1°,
44.21°, 64.44°, and 77.33° correspond to the (111),
(200), (220), and (311) crystalline planes of the face-centered cubic
crystal structure of Ag (JCPDS, file no. 04-0783), which demonstrates
the existence of Ag electrode layer.

Sensing Performance of
the IPMC Sensor
An IPMC sample typically consists of a thin
ion-exchange membrane and a noble metal as electrodes on both surfaces. Figure 4a displays the sensing
mechanism of the IPMC sensor. As we know, the Nafion membrane contains
the sulfonic acid group and can be ionized and release the mobile
hydrions with adsorbed water. When the sensor is in a flat state,
mobile hydrions uniformly disperse in the Nafion membrane. When a
bend deformation is applied on the sensor, an elastic stress gradient
is generated along the thickness. The mobile hydrions on the compressed
side of the membrane migrate and accumulate on the lower hydraulic
pressure side of the membrane. More hydrions accumulate on the stretched
side, resulting in a positive potential. The voltage signal is generated
from ion movement and accumulation in the deformation process, so
the sensor could generate electrical signal without external energy
supply.

vs strain (ε). (f) Bending and recovery of the IPMC sensor for
3000 cycles of 3 mm displacement.

For the sensing mechanism of the sensor, we buit a corresponding test platform and obtained
signals of sensors under different strains. The test method can be
found in the Experimental Methods section.
The output electrical signals of magnetron sputtering depositing silver
particle-based sensor and conventional electroless plating-based sensor
are shown in Figure 4b. Output voltage shows a periodic alternation of positive
voltage, and output voltage of the magnetron sputtering sensor is
112.55 mV. However, when the IPMC sensor returns back after bending,
hysteresis is produced because the movement of the ions is not as
fast as electron transport. Thus, the signal peak is asymmetric. Output
potential of the electroless plating sensor is 1.80 mV. The signal
of magnetron sputtering is much larger than that of the electroless
plating sensor. The ability of the IPMC sensor to recognize the orientation
is shown in Figure 4c. The insets in Figure 4c display the real operation scenes of upward-bending and
downward-bending in the test process. For the first six times, the
sensor bends downward to get the negative voltage, and for the latter
six times, the sensor bends up and gets a positive voltage. As the
sensor bends to opposite directions, positive and negative relative
potentials appear in turn, respectively. A series of bending deformations
of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 mm are repeatedly measured (Figure 4d). Different displacements
produce different signals, indicating high repeatability and sensibility
of IPMC sensors.

We use the Euler–Bernoulli theory to
build a model to calculate the strain at the corresponding displacement.
The film sensor has a thickness of h and a length
of L. When the displacement platform moves x, the film is curved. A schematic diagram is shown in Figure S2. Assuming that the central angle of
the curved arc is θ, the radius is R. According
to the geometric relations, we can list the equations 1   2  

We know L and x and can
get θ and R from eqs 1 and 2. Finally, the
Euler–Bernoulli approximation theory is used to calculate the
bending strain, and the strain corresponding to the displacement is
obtained. 3  

Using this method, the strain of our IPMC is 1.03% at a displacement
of 3 mm.

Potential signal as a function of a series of strain
is given in Figure 4e, which exhibits an approximately linear correlation. Small error
bars (standard deviations) are taken from 10 times measurement. Therefore,
the IPMC sensor has perfect repeatability. The sensor potential under
the maintained extended state is also detected (Figure S3). When the sensor keeps bending, the signal continues
to increase and then begins to fall slowly. The output signal declines
around 5% slowly when the sensor maintained 10 s bending state (Figure S3a). The output signal declines around
27.5% while maintaining 60 s bending state (Figure S3b). In order to analyze the durable performance of the IPMC
sensor, cyclical bending deformation and recovery of the sensor was
measured for 3000 cycles of 3 mm displacement and is shown in Figure 4f. The insets in Figure 4f show the details
of the cyclic test. The output potential signals of the sensor are
stably maintained with a relative small variation. Although the signal
has slight attenuation, the signal is still much larger than the signal
of the electroless plating-based sensor, and the peak type is consistent.
It is proved that the sensors have a relatively good cycle stability.
Therefore, the sensor fulfills the requirement for practical application.
This is the result of our preliminary experimental stage. In the future,
we will continue to explore and improve its durable performance. The
electromechanical behavior of IPMC under electrical voltage stimulation
of ±1 V is also investigated (Figure S4). The bending displacement is monitored by a laser displacement
meter. Bending displacement reaches 11.0 μm. The size of the
mobile ions in the IPMC is small. If we increase the number of mobile
ions and soak large-size ions in the Nafion membrane, the electromechanical
behavior of IPMC will be improved.

The traditional method for
preparing an IPMC sensor is manual processing for roughing Nafion
film and electroless plating for electrode layers. The signal of our
sensor (112.55 mV, Figure 4b) is about 63 times compared with that of electroless plating-based
sensor (1.80 mV, Figure 4b). We read the relevant literature studies and found that the signal
of the sensor made by electroless plating is relatively low. The IPMC
sensor prepared by Song32 can generate
a voltage signal of 20 mV. This is the largest signal of IPMC we have
seen from the literature so far. However, the signal of our IPMC sensor
is much larger than this value. The electrode layer thickness of the
electroless plating-based IPMC sensor is about 3–5 μm.
The electrode layer thickness of the magnetron sputtering-based IPMC
sensor is 280–300 nm. For the electroless plating-based IPMC
sensor, the impregnation–reduction steps were repeated five
times. The reduction step is a process of electrode layer growth,
and the reduction takes a total of 25 h. The growth rate is 0.12–0.2
μm/h. For the magnetron sputtering-based IPMC sensor, magnetron
sputtering lasts for 30 min and the electrode layer thickness increases
to 280–300 nm. The growth rate is 0.56–0.6 μm/h.
In order to evaluate the effect of the in situ etching and magnetron
sputtering depositing method to increase potential signal, first,
the average root mean square (rms) surface roughness (Rq) value of the treated Nafion membrane is measured and
analyzed. Figure 5a,b
shows 3D atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of Nafion membrane of
plasma etching processing and manual processing, respectively. The
average Rq value of Nafion membrane of
plasma etching processing is about 72.9 nm. The measured Rq value for manual processing Nafion membrane is about
65.6 nm and is relatively lower. It is clear from the AFM image that
surface grooves of the plasma etching-treated membrane are evenly
distributed and have comparatively consistent depth compared with
those of the manual processing membrane, which greatly benefits for
the proper microstructural development. The observed more uniform
rough surface is a desirable two-dimensional layer by layer growth
mode (Frank–van der Merwe mode).33Figure 5c shows Nyquist
plots of the IPMC sensors. The equivalent series resistance of the
magnetron sputtering-based IPMC sensor is 2 Ω, which is much
lower than that of electroless plating-based sensor (equivalent series
resistance of is 145 Ω). The magnetron sputtering-based IPMC
sensor shows a good interface contact between the electrolyte and
electrode as well as excellent electronic conductivity of the electrode
material. The surface sheet resistance of the electrode film is as
high as 0.08–0.15 Ω/□, further confirming excellent
electronic conductivity. In summary, it is proved that the in situ
plasma etching and magnetron sputtering depositing method is effective
for fabricating high-performance IPMC sensors.

plasma etching-based Nafion membrane. (b) 3D AFM image of the manual
processing-based Nafion membrane. (c) Nyquist plots of three electrodes
of the IPMC sensor with electroless plating and the IPMC sensor with
magnetron sputtering. The inset picture clearly displays Nyquist plots
of three electrodes of the IPMC sensor with magnetron sputtering.

However, the plasma etching power
and duration have a great influence on the degree and uniformity of
the film surface etching. In addition, magnetron sputtering time,
sputtering power, working pressure, and working argon flow rate also
have great impact on the performance of the sensor. Consequently,
the conditions of the preparation process are optimized to obtain
excellent IPMC sensors. Cho et al.34 studied
that the etching procedure did not alter the chemical character of
the membrane. Only the physical roughness does not affect performance.
The surface morphologies of the modified Nafion membranes are investigated
by using SEM, as shown in Figure 6a–i. The surface roughness enhances with increase
of power (Figure 6a–f)
or time (Figure 6g–i)
because of the effect of the plasma etching treatment. Output potential
signals of IPMC sensors of different plasma etching powers or time
can be used as a parameter to determine the best conditions, which
is shown in Figure 7a,b. When the etching power is 8 or 10 W, the prepared sensor cannot
obtain a stable output signal. The output signal increases to the
maximum and then significantly goes down as the etching power increases.
When the etching time is 360 s, the sensor has maximum output signal.
The Nafion membrane surface can be etched efficiently, which affects
the output signal of IMPC.

and constant 180 s etching duration on the Nafion membrane surface:
(a) 8 W; (b) 10 W; (c) 12 W; (d) 14 W; (e) 16 W; and (f) 18 W. SEM

of different plasma etching powers and constant 180 s etching duration
on the Nafion membrane surface. (b) Output potential signals of IPMC
sensors of different plasma etching durations and constant 14 W etching
power on the Nafion membrane surface.

In the same method, the effects of sputtering time, sputtering
power, working pressure, and working argon flow rate on the film performance
are tested with indicators such as electrode layer thickness and output
potential signal while keeping other parameters constant.

Figure 8a shows output potential
signals and electrode layer thicknesses of sensors under different
sputtering power. In a certain range, the greater the sputtering power,
the deposited particles have higher energy and the metal element deposition
on the substrates is accelerated. Therefore, the particles have higher
adhesion with the substrate. The film thickness increases with the
increase of sputtering power. Output potential signal reaches the
maximum value at 100 W power; the value of the output potential is
an important parameter of device performance. Therefore, the sputtering
power at 100 W is considered as a better value to ensure outstanding
sensor performance.

Figure 8 Curve of output potential signals and electrode layer
thicknesses of sensors under different magnetron sputtering conditions:
(a) 90–130 W different sputtering power and constant sputtering
30 min duration, 1.0 Pa working pressure, 30 sccm argon flow rate;
(b) 5–60 min different sputtering time and constant sputtering

0.25–3.5 Pa different sputtering working pressure and constant

and (d) 20–40 sccm different sputtering argon flow rate and
constant sputtering 120 W power, 30 min duration, 30 sccm argon flow
rate.

Figure 8b depicts output potential signals and electrode
layer thicknesses of sensors under different sputtering times. It
is observed that the electrode layer thickness increases with increase
of sputtering time. To be more specific, with the increase of sputtering
time, the content of silver increases. The number of particles deposits
onto the Nafion substrate increases. ZAO films were prepared by magnetron
sputtering conducted by Song,35 who has
already shown that for a longer sputtering time, the thickness of
the film increases as well, and interestingly shows a linear correspondence
to sputtering time. Output potential signal reaches the maximum value
at 30 min. With a shorter deposition time, there are less particles
on the substrate. As the deposition time increases, the number of
particles increases, and the layer thickens. The electrode layer has
good compactness. However, with a longer deposition time, the electrode
layer thickness increases, which is not conducive to sensors bending
deformation. The electrode is easy to peel and split as the thickness
increases. Thus, the sputtering time at 30 min is considered as a
better value to ensure sensor performance excellent.

It can
be seen from Figure 8c that with the increase of working pressure, the electrode layer
thickness decreases. With a lower deposition pressure, there are less
collisions in the path of particles to the substrate. Particles can
easily reach the substrate to form a film and the film has good performance.
However, when the deposition pressure increases, there are more collisions
in the path of particles to the substrate, thus the particles energy
decreases. The amount of particles reaching the substrate decreases,
which causes more defects in the films and leads to the decrease of
electrode layer thickness. Output potential signal of sensor increases
from 2.2 mV (0.25 Pa) to a maximum value at 29.4 mV (1.0 Pa) and then
goes down to 9.5 mV at 3.4 Pa. Considering appropriate electrode layer
thickness and electrical signals, the sensor performance is more excellent
when the deposition pressure at 1.3 Pa.

Figure 8d shows the variety of electrode layer thicknesses
and output potential signals of sensors as a function of different
the argon flow rate. Apparently, the electrode layer thickness decreases
with the increase of argon flow rate. When the magnetron sputtering
starts, the electrons collide with the argon atoms in the process
of flying to the substrate under the action of the electric field
and produce argon ions and new electrons. Argon ions in the electric
field accelerate toward the cathode target and high-energy bombard
the target surface, and the target sputtering occurred. Neutral target
atoms or molecules are deposited on the substrate to form a thin film.
The higher argon flow rate increases the working pressure, and there
is lower mobility and a great number of native defects. The output
potential signal of the sensor rises to a peak value at an argon flow
rate of 30 sccm and then decreases as the argon flow rate further
increases.

From inspection, the maximum voltage signal is found
to be 29.55 mV for the sample grown using an argon flow rate of 30
sccm. Considering the stability of the sensors and the output of the
electrical signal, the optimal argon flow rate is 28 sccm.

Conclusions
In this work, an Ag electrode-based IPMC sensor is fabricated on
a flexible Nafion substrate by the in situ plasma etching and dc balanced
magnetron sputtering deposition technique. The new method shortens
the fabrication period greatly from 2 weeks to 2 h to obtain IPMC
sensors with sizes up to 9 cm × 9 cm or arrays in various patterns.
The integrated operation ensures all sample batch stability and performance
repeatability. These IPMC sensors can generate electrical signals
under the external bending deformation for mobile hydrions migrate
and accumulate on the lower hydraulic pressure side. IPMC sensors
we fabricated can generate nearly 200 mV potential signal without
external power supply under a 1.6% bending-induced strain and recognize
different directions of the bending strain. The signal of our sensor
is much larger than that of the traditional electroless plating-based
sensor. What’s more, this IPMC sensor is suitable for in long-term
and large-scale bending and have high sensitivity as well as linear
correlation with strain.

The plasma etching-based Nafion membrane
has higher rms surface roughness (Rq)
values. Surface grooves of membrane are evenly distributed and have
comparatively consistent depth. The equivalent series resistance of
the magnetron sputtering-based IPMC sensor is 2 Ω, which is
much lower than that of the electroless plating-based sensor (equivalent
series resistance of is 145 Ω). The magnetron sputtering-based
sensor shows a good interface contact between the electrolyte and
electrode as well as excellent electronic conductivity of the electrode
material. Optimal properties of the IPMC sensor are obtained with
plasma etching power at 14 W, plasma etching duration at 360 s, magnetron
sputtering power at 100 W, magnetron sputtering time at 30 min, magnetron
sputtering working pressure at 1.3 Pa, and a magnetron sputtering
working argon flow rate at 28 sccm. From these data, the IPMC sensor
fabricated by in situ plasma etching and magnetron sputtering has
high performance of large and stable output signal. The study provides
a manufacturable and integrative method and equipment with short processing
time and high reproducibility for large-scale preparing flexible sensors
of mechanical bending durability on flexible substrates. This preparation
method is scalable and silver electrodes can be replaced with other
metallic materials such as gold, copper, chromium, indium tin oxide
(ITO), aluminum oxide, and so forth. We believe that this method provides
a new route to short-time and quantifiably fabricate IPMC sensors
for potential wearable applications in real-time monitoring human
motion and human–machine interaction.

Experimental Methods
Materials
and Instruments
Hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, HAuCl4, 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate (Phen), and sodium sulfite
were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co. Ltd. The Nafion
117 membrane was purchased from the Dupont. Equipment with the commercial
dc balanced magnetron sputtering system and the inductive coupled
plasma-reactive ion etcher was customized.

Preparation of the IPMC
Sensor by in Situ Plasma Etching and Magnetron Sputtering Depositing
Before etching, the Nafion membrane was cleaned by hydrogen peroxide
(5% mass fraction) and diluted sulfuric acid (1 mol L–1). Then, the Nafion membrane (suitable for different size) was fixed
on the hollow part of the rotatable sample holder in the chamber allowing
the rotation at a speed of 5 rpm of the substrate along a direction,
which assures sample uniformity of etching and metallizing over the
entire surface. The chamber pressure was pumped down to below 3 ×
10–4 pa in order to prevent residual atmosphere
effects on the composition of the Nafion films. Then, the argon valve
was opened and the argon flow rate was set as 8 sccm. All of the specimens
were grown by using pure argon (99.99%) as etching and sputtering
gas. We controlled the screen voltage, the screen current, and etching
duration during plasma etching to get a sample with uniform etching
and excellent performance. After completing treatment of one side
of the Nafion membrane, the holder was turned over 180° by the
mechanical handle, and the opposite side of the membrane was etched.
Then, magnetron sputtering deposited silver particles on the metallic
polymer. The sputtering process was performed at room temperature.
The chamber pressure was adjusted to appropriate value. The argon
flow rate was set to what we want. Then, the deposition power and
duration parameters were set. Once the deposition was completed, the
holder was turned over 180° by the mechanical handle, and the
opposite side of the polymer was processed. No post annealing was
performed after deposition. The substrate temperature was maintained
at 20 °C approximately during the deposition process. The Nafion
membrane is cleaned with ionized water, vacuumed in the chamber, etched,
and sputtered to plate the electrodes. The Nafion membrane retains
its intrinsic water, which assures the migration of ions in the membrane,
thereby generating the sensing signal. The IPMC sensor was cut into
a size of 25 mm × 5 mm for the experimental test.

Preparation
of the Electroless Plating-Based Sensor
The Nafion membrane
was roughed by 1200 sandpaper polishing 800 times both sides. Then,
the Nafion membrane was cleaned. Next step, the Nafion membrane was
placed into a solution of [Au(Phen)Cl2]Cl for 24 h to allow
the sufficient impregnation of cations. After that, the Nafion membrane
was immersed into deionized water in water-bath heating. A Na2SO3 solution of 5 mmol L–1 was
slowly dropped into the water till the Au cations at the membrane’s
surface are reduced to Au particles totally. The impregnation–reduction
steps were repeated five times.

Sensing Measurement
The IPMC sensors need to be deformed to produce a voltage signal.
We built a corresponding test platform, including signal generation
section and signal collection section. The signal generation section
includes fixtures, displacement platform (MTS121), and displacement
stepper motor. The signal collection section includes an electrochemical
workstation and a controller computer. The displacement platform can
realize precise displacement control in the X-axis
direction, with an accuracy of 0.005 mm. Moreover, the displacement
platform can realize and control different movement rates, the number
of cycle displacements, and the distance of displacement, including
any distance of 0–7 mm. The electrochemical workstation can
collect and display on the computer the electrical signals generated
by the deformation of the sensor. Therefore, we can use this measurement
platform to realize the basic bending performance test of our sensor.
The IPMC sensor in response to the cyclic bending and resuming flat
state is tested. The sensor is placed on the displacement platform
and is clamped by fixtures. The sensors we test have an effective
length of 1.8 cm. Also, the maximum displacement of the platform is
set as 3 mm. The displacement platform gradually moves from 0 to 3
mm, the signal generated by the sensor gradually increases from 0,
and then the displacement platform gradually returns from 3 to 0 mm.
The signal generated by the sensor gradually decreases from the maximum
value.

Characterization
Surface morphology and cross-sectional
SEM images were obtained with a Hitachi S-4800 filed emission scanning
electron microscope. The 3D AFM images and the average rms surface
roughness (Rq) values were obtained with
a Dimension 3100 atomic force microscope. EDX was performed on Quanta
400FEG (FEI). XRD patterns were obtained on a X’Pert-Pro MPD
(Cu Kα). The surface sheet resistance of the electrode film
was tested by using a multifunctional digital four-probe tester (ST-2258C).
