Radiation chemical modeling of redox
reactions of biologically
active compounds from plant materials showed that coumarins possess
strong antiradical properties. Data confirming the radioprotective
properties of these compounds were obtained. Antioxidant activity
has been shown for specific medicinal plant extracts—Melilotus officinalis and Ledum palustre cormus. The radiation chemical transformations of coumarins revealed
that an unsubstituted coumarin has greater radioprotective activity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Environmental pollution
caused by hazardous emissions from industrial
production and energetics of radioactive materials causes our body
to be constantly exposed to negative factors, one of which is ionizing
radiation. It is known that exposure can cause the formation of reactive
oxygen species.1−4 The human body possesses a variety of protection systems, including
radioprotectors and antioxidants (AOs).5 The introduction of food or drinks with radioprotective properties
reduces the effect of radiation exposure.6 Various radioprotectors are known to be used in the protection of
living organisms, for example, biogenic amines without the sulfhydryl
group, aminothiols (propamine, aminoethylisothiouronium, etc.), ascorbic
acid,7 vitamin E,8 carotene, polysulfides of gallic acid,9 cysteine, cysteamine hydrochloride, coenzyme Q9,10,11 vitulin,12 dimethyl sulfoxide,13 some carbohydrates, biologically active plant
and medicinal preparations,14−18 beech-tree oil Fagus orientalis,19 phenolic compounds,20−23 and others.

The main mechanisms
of the protective effect exerted by radioprotectors
during exposure to radiation20,24 are as follows: competition
for the strong oxidizing agents and free radicals formed upon the
radiolysis of water, solvents, and other media; protection of radiosensitive
enzymes, hormones, and protein molecules; complexation of heavy metal
ions25 and of cations with several common
oxidation states; and inhibition of chain oxidation reactions.26 The role of secondary reactions in the radioprotective
effect and the elucidation of the toxic properties of chemical radioprotectors
and their reaction products is complex and contradictory. It may often
altogether prevent the phenomenon of a radioprotective effect. At
this point, a search for biologically active compounds (BACs) from
plant materials which exhibit high radioresistance and which produce
secondary reaction products with nontoxic properties is of great interest.

Investigation into the transformations of naturally occurring compounds
exposed to ionizing radiation, the determination of their radiation
stability and of the mechanism of their redox reactions is of great
importance.27,28

One of the important and
promising families of such compounds is
the coumarin (Coum).29 Coums are the organic
compounds which consist of a benzene ring joined to a pyrone ring.
Coums are widely found in the plant kingdom. Depending on the structure,
Coum has differing properties and a number of biological activities
such as anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, anticancer, anti-allergic,
and photodynamic activities. The use of Coum as AOs and radioprotectors
is of great interest.30−32 Wang et al.33 investigated
the anticancer activity of a coumarin derivative—esculetin—extracted
from the herb Cortex Fraxini. It was established that the exact Coum
content in a medicinal plant material is related to the exhibition
of its anticancer and antiradical activities. Esculetin was shown
to have an inhibitory effect on the human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells.

A large number of plants comprise the organic BACs—Coums,
flavonoids,34−36 carotenoids, porphyrins, chlorophylls, and so forth
and their metal complexes.37−40 From the literature,41,42 it is known
that various Coums are found in a high level; medicinal plants consist
of Coum itself and dihydrocoumarin in Melilotus officinalis,43 and esculin, esculetin, scopoletin,
and umbelliferone in Ledum palustre cormus.44 Moreover, it is important to
notice that the plant material includes many micro-elements (e.g.,
manganese, copper, ferrum, selenium, magnesium, aluminum, and silver).
Habitat, climate, soil composition, and other factors are known to
impact the mineral composition of plants. The majority of plants containing
the important mineral micro-elements play a significant role in exhibition
of biological activity for living organisms.45

Application of a radiation chemical modeling of redox reactions
in systems became very effective in investigation and prediction of
the polyphenolic compounds’ AO and radioprotective properties.46,47 Methods for the determination of the reactivity of polyphenolic
nature compounds can be divided into direct and indirect.30 The direct methods are based on detecting short-lived
intermediate particles and free-radical formation of e̅solv, O2•, HO2•, HO•, H2O2, R•, RO•, RO2• in liquid
and solid systems and the study on its properties using modern physical
chemistry methods such as pulse radiolysis, chemoluminescent analysis,
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and polarography. The indirect
methods are based on a change in concentration of the phenolic compounds
when exposed to ionizing radiation using different methods such as
spectrophotometry, EPR, voltammetry, chromatography, and others.

Using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-stable free radical
under normal conditions is quite common for the indirect methods.
DPPH solution changes in color and in paramagnetic properties upon
reduction. Thus, this makes it useful for the investigation of the
polyphenolic compound reactivity using ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometry and EPR. The results of the work48,49 showed that the DPPH reducing rate is directly dependent on reactivity
of AOs.

In the present work, Coum and its water–ethanolic
extracts
from the plant material are investigated in order to search and create
new BACs with strong AO and radioprotective properties. Reactions
with active particles of radiolysis are considered as basis of interactions.
Yeast cells “Feodosiya-7” were applied to determine
the Coum radioprotective effect.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Micro- and Macro-elemental
Composition of M. officinalis and L. palustre Cormus by the ICP–MS Method
It is known50 that functional activity
of the studied plants
is associated with the content of certain elements in plant materials.
Using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS)
analysis method, it was established (Table 1) that magnesium is more plentiful in L. palustre cormus, while the same is true for iron, copper, and zinc—in M. officinalis. Microquantities of selenium, which
is thought to be responsible for some AO properties, were also registered
in the studied plants.

2.2 Antiradical Activity of Coum and Plant Extracts
(on the Base DPPH)
It was established that one of the mechanisms
of AO action is the ability of an AO of polyphenolic nature to easily
donate hydrogen, forming a phenoxyl radical (PhO•), which is much less active (reaction 2). Free-radical DPPH51 was
used to detect the AO properties of the studied plants (Figure 1). The PhO• compound with an unpaired electron, which appeared as a result of
hydrogen detachment, is involved in the formation of the inactive
reaction products48 (reactions 3 or 4) 1   2   3   4

was applied. Measurements taken after introducing DPPH into the system
for 30 min.

We have registered (Table 2) a decrease of approximately
37 ± 2% of the effect of
the DPPH reaction with L. palustre cormus
as the irradiation dose increased; it was noted that the effect of
the DPPH reaction with the irradiated extracts of L.
palustre cormus remains above 50%. Therefore, a decrease
of DPPH efficiency in the reaction with L. palustre cormus extracts upon exposure to ionizing radiation may indicate
the protective properties of L. palustre cormus.

The effect of the interaction of Coum with DPPH was not registered.
At the same time, it was found that individual Coums,esculletin, esculin,
and scopoletin, which are part of the extract of L.
palustre cormus, participate in the reaction with
DPPH after irradiation (Table 3).

a The concentration of coumarins was
0.01 M in 40% ethanol solution. Measurements taken after introducing
DPPH into the system for 30 min.

To start the reaction, the DPPH water–ethanolic solution
was added into irradiated solutions of Coum. The concentration of
Coums was 0.01 M in 40% ethanol solution. It is important to note
that an increase in antiradical activity with an increase in the absorbed
dose (based on the reaction with DPPH) was recorded for umbelliferone.
It can be assumed that umbelliferone has a greater AO activity because
of the interaction with the products of ethanol radiolysis.

2.3 Determination of the Concentration of Coum
from M. officinalis Extracts after
Exposure of Ionizing Radiation
The effect of dilution of
the extracts on radiation sensitivity was confirmed by the influence
of ethanol concentration on the extraction of Coum from M. officinalis.

Then, for research, the 30,
50, and 70% extracts of M. officinalis were de-aerated. Concentrations of Coum from M. officinalis extracts after irradiation (dose of 6 kGy) were calculated by calibration
with naphthalene (Table 4).

Table 4 Concentrations of Coum in 30, 50,
and 70% Extracts of M. officinalis before
and after Irradiation with a Dose of 6 kGy
content of ethanol in the system (% volume)	initial [Coum]in × 10–4 (mol/L)	irradiated [Coum]irrad × 10–4 (D = 6 kGy)	degree of

30	3.2	2.3	28.1	
50	2.5	2.4	4.0	
70	2.0	1.6	20.0	
It can
be assumed that the low radiation stability of the 30% solution
is associated with the unique structure of ethanol in the initial
30–40% Coum solution.

2.4 Determination of the Oxidative
Activity of
Extracts in Reaction with Carbon-Centered α-hydroxyethyl Radicals
CH3C•HOH
Gas chromatography
was used to determine the radiation chemical yields of ethanal (EA)
(reaction 5) during the
radiolysis of 70% de-aerated ethanol extracts of M.
officinalis and L. palustre cormus after the reaction with free carbon-centered α-hydroxyethyl
radicals (HERs). The main molecular products of de-aerated ethanol
radiolysis are EA (CH3CHO) and butanediol-2,352−57 5  

If a BAC is capable of intercepting
an HER, then EA would not be accumulated in the system with increasing
irradiation and the oxidizing properties of the radicals will be reduced. Figure 2 shows the accumulation
curves of EA in the system as a function of the increase in absorbed
dose for the studied 70% de-aerated extracts of M.
officinalis and L. palustre cormus. The radiation chemical yield of EA was calculated using
the first derivatives of these functions, according to formula 6(58) 6  where CEA is the
concentration of EA, mol/L; ρ is the density of the solvent,
g/L; D is absorbed dose, Gy.

Figure 2 Dependence of EA accumulation
on the absorbed dose for de-aerated
70% water–ethanolic extracts from plant materials: 1—70%
water–ethanolic solution without components (control), 2—M. officinalis, 3—L. palustre cormus.

The radiation chemical yield of
EA in ethanol is 1 molecule/100
eV,53 which correlates with the published
data. As it can be seen in Figure 2, the curves showing the dependence of EA concentration
from the absorbed dose for the studied herbal extracts lie higher
than the ones for ethanol, which demonstrates EA accumulation, and,
therefore, it corresponds to larger radiation chemical yields (G). It is known53 that the maximum
value of G (EA) does not exceed 5.5 molecules/100
eV. For L. palustre cormus in the dose
range from 0 to 120 Gy, G (EA) was equal to 20 molecules/100
eV, which may indicate the contribution of chain processes occurring
in the extract immediately after irradiation. In fact, in the postirradiation
period, an occurrence of uncontrolled oxidation processes was recorded.

It was found that oxidative activity of the studied extracts from
plant materials decreases in the order L. palustre cormus > M. officinalis. Under
the
same irradiation conditions, M. officinalis extracts have insignificant oxidizing properties.

2.5 Evaluation of the Radioprotective Activity
of Coum Found in Extracts from Plant Materials Using Yeast Cells Saccharomyces cerevisiae of the Race Feodosiya-7
In this work, we studied the radioprotective activity of Coum obtained
from the extracts of M. officinalis and L. palustre cormus on the yeast
cells S. cerevisiae of the Feodosiya-7
race, which is a convenient model subject for studying the effects
of ionizing exposure on living systems. The concentration of K+ ions in the medium with yeast irradiated in the absence of
Coum was taken as 100%. Radioprotective activity corresponds to the
concentration of potassium ions in solution after irradiation: the
smaller the loss of ions K+, the more pronounced the antiradical
and protective properties of Coum.59

Coums obtained from the herbal extracts were isolated according to
the protocol.60 The results of studies
of the radioprotective activity of Coum obtained from the herbal extracts
(Figure 3) made clear
that the water solutions of Coum isolated from M. officinalis demonstrated radioprotective properties, while the Coum extracted
from L. palustris cormus did not demonstrate
them.

Figure 3 Yield of [K+] % ions from yeast cells irradiated after
Coum was introduced into them 1—control, 2—coumarins
from M. officinalis, and 3—coumarins
from L. palustre cormus. Dose = 0.4
kGy.

Information on the radioprotective
properties of Coum itself can
be found in ref (30). Coum has a protective effect in the range of concentrations from
0.003 mg/cm3 (3 × 10–3 g/L) to 0.03
mg/cm3 (3 × 10–2 g/L) and retains
the ability of yeast cells to divide. At the same time, the re-activating
effect of Coum is weakly expressed: only a slight increase in the
number of viable yeast cells was noted. Radioprotective properties
of M. officinalis are associated with
the presence of Coum in it.

3 Experimental
Section
Dried samples were used from the pharmacy network: M. officinalis herb from “Kameliya-LT”
series “Force of nature”, Russia, (Figure 4a) and L. Palustre cormus shoots of the company “Krasnogorskmedfacilities”,
Russia, (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 Photos

Samples of coumarin (99%) (coumarin, esculetin, esculin,
scopoletin,
and umbelliferone) and DPPH were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Structural
formulas for Coum are shown in Figure 5.

(c) esculin, (d) scopoletin, and (e) umbelliferone.

3.1 Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
Samples of dry plants were crushed before the analysis. Crushed
samples (100 mg) were placed in fluoroplastic autoclaves; then, 4
mL of nitric and 0.10 mL of hydrofluoric acids were added. The autoclave
was sealed and kept in a microwave sample preparation system-6 (180
°C, 20 atm) for 15 min. Sample solution after dilution with 2%
HNO3 was analyzed by ICP–MS (Thermo Scientific Fisher
mass spectrometer iCAP-Qc) using argon as a plasma-forming gas.61

3.2 Chromatography Conditions
for Ethanal Concentration
Determination in Extracts from Herb Raw
Extracts (1:20, 70%
ethanol by volume) from raw materials were prepared. The solutions
were de-aerated and irradiated. Analysis was carried out immediately
after opening the irradiated glass ampules in the postradiation period.
A Chromatek Crystal 5000 (Russia) chromatograph equipped with a 2
m × 2 mm column filled with Polysorb-1 with a size of 0.1–0.25
mm was used. The volume of the injected sample was 1 μL. Detection
was carried out on a flame ionization detector (FID) at a temperature
of 160 °C with an air flow of 250 mL/min and a hydrogen flow
of 25 mL/min. The carrier gas flow rate (helium grade A as the gradient
mobile phase) was as follows: 30 mL/min (9–10 min), 40 mL/min
(13 min), and 30 mL/min (0 min).

3.3 Chromatography
Conditions for Concentration
of Coumarin Determination in M. officinalis
Varian column VF-5 ms (length 60 m, diameter 0.25 mm, and
layer thickness 0.25 μm) was used. The flow of carrier gas (helium
grade 6.0) was 2 mL/min. Temperature setting were as follows: evaporator
250 °C, detector (FID) 250 °C, the thermostat 200 °C
(4 min), and heating to 290 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min.

3.4 60Co γ-Source
The
RCHM-γ-20 plant housing a 60Co γ-ray source
(D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia) was used
as the 60Co γ-source. A Fricke dosimeter was used
to estimate the dose rate of the absorbed radiation. The dose rate
was determined to be 0.078 ± 0.002 Gy/s.62,63

3.5 Experimental Approach
Antiradical
properties of extracts from M. officinalis, L. palustre cormus, and Coum were
estimated by reaction with stabile free-radical DPPH. The concentration
of DPPH in ethanol was 0.2 mM. Spectrophotometry was used, and the
optical density values were measured at λ = 517 nm, with 50%
ethanol solution as a comparison sample.48

The added volume of water–ethanol extracts was 200
μL, and the composition was brought to the total 50% ethanol
content in the system. After adding DPPH (2 mL) in the system, it
was stored in a dark place and measured after 30 min. The percentage
of inhibition of DPPH (Inh., %) extracts was calculated using formula 7 7  where Ac is the
optical density of water–ethanol DPPH solution in the absence
of additives (control) and Ao is the optical
density of water–ethanol DPPH solution in the presence of additives.

Ethanol solution (40%) of 0.01 M coumarins were irradiated. The
added volume of coumarin solution was 200 μL, the composition
was brought to the total 50% ethanol content in the system, and DPPH
(2 mL) was added in the system, and then, the system was stored for
30 min in a dark place and measured.

The coumarin concentrations
in water–ethanol (1:20 mass
extracts of M. officinalis and L. palustre cormus) were determined. Afterward, the
following procedures were carried out:53 samples of 25 mL are taken and then transferred to a round-bottom
flask, 200 mL of deionized water and 25 mL of chloroform were diluted
and mixed well, 0.3 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added, and the
given solution was stored at room temperature in a dark place for
24 h. After a day, 10 mL of the selected lower layer of the extract
was vacuumed using a water jet pump; the dried residue was dissolved
in a solution of 500 μL of naphthalene in CHCl3 (internal
standard) with stirring. The resulting solution (250 μL) is
used to determine the concentration of coumarin. The ratio of coumarin
peak areas to the naphthalene area was determined by the results of
chromatogram analysis (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Chromatogram of Coum solution in naphthalene with chloroform. Chromatographic
peaks: 1—chloroform, 2—naphthalene, and 3—Coum.

A calibration graph for concentrations of coumarin
in M. officinalis extracts using the
internal naphthalene
standard is shown in Figure 7. This technique was applied to water–ethanolic solutions
of M. officinalis depending on the
concentration of ethanol.

ratio SCoum/Sstandard on concentrations
of Coum.

Results on Figure 8 demonstrate the nonlinear dependence of
Coum concentrations in M. officinalis on the content of ethanol. It was
found that the maximum concentration of Coum contained in 30–40%
alcoholic solutions of M. officinalis, and it is equal to 2.8–3.2 × 10–4 g/L.

3.6 Radioprotective Activity
Determination of
Coum: Diploid Yeast S. cerevisiae was
Used in the Logarithmic Growth Phase22
Coum from plant extracts was isolated by a previous method.60 Yeast was exposed to γ-radiation 60Co on RCHM-γ-20 at a dose of 0.4 kGy and measured a
day after irradiation, and the concentration of K+ ions
in the medium was estimated using a potassium-selective electrode
(pH meter ionomer “ECOTEST-2000”, Russia).

The
concentration of K+ ions in the medium with yeast irradiated
in the absence of Coum was taken as 100%. Radioprotective activity
corresponds to the concentration of potassium ions in solution after
irradiation: the smaller the loss of K+ ions, the more
pronounced the antiradical and protective properties of Coum.59

4 Conclusions
The
ionizing radiation is successfully used in high energy chemistry
as a source of initiation in water–ethanolic solution of highly
reactive redox particles: e̅solv, O2•, HO2•, HO•, H2O2, R•, RO•, and RO2•. This allows us to study the radiation
chemical transformations of water–ethanolic extracts from plant
materials. As a result of studies of radiation chemical redox reactions
in ethanolic extracts of BACs from plant materials, the dependence
of oxidative activity on HERs for the herbal extracts was established: L. palustre cormus > M. officinalis. It was found that BACs of the M. officinalis extract show moderate pro-oxidant properties.

The antioxidant
activity of extracts from plant materials was studied
on the samples of L. palustre cormus
and M. officinalis. For M. officinalis and Coum, no antiradical activity
was recorded in the reaction with DPPH. However, for the L. palustre cormus extract, high values of protective
activity were recorded (on the base of the reaction with DPPH).

It was found that coumarins obtained from the M.
officinalis extract have radioprotective activity,
which was absent for coumarins obtained from L. palustre cormus. As a result, it was shown that not all BACs of a herbal
origin have radioprotective activity. However, on the other hand,
it can be assumed that all radioprotectors of a plant origin can act
as AOs.
