In
this study, a hydrothermal route was used to design a novel
NiAlTi layered double hydroxide. The material so-obtained was characterized
using various physiochemical techniques such as X-ray diffraction,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis
for structural analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy for morphological analysis, and so on. The material
so-obtained was further applied for wastewater remediation and was
found to be an efficient, cost-effective, and reusable adsorbent.
Organic contaminants such as dyes and antibiotics were used as pollutants
to carry out the removal study. NiAlTi LDH was found to be an excellent
adsorbent for the removal of anionic dyes and antibiotics. Excellent
performance was shown by NiAlTi LDH at a broad pH range from 4 to
10 for anionic dyes (orange II and methyl orange), but tetracycline
removal was predominantly maximum at pH = 9. Further, the kinetic
studies also revealed that the adsorption process of both organic
contaminants obeyed a pseudo-second-order model. In addition, the
Langmuir isotherm adsorption model fitted the experimental results
for both types of pollutants very well. The attained maximum adsorption
capacity was superb for both organic dyes and antibiotics (1250 mg/g
for MO, 2000 mg/g for OII, and 238.09 mg/g for TC). NiAlTi LDH was
also capable of simultaneous elimination from a mixture of antibiotics
and dyes. Further, NiAlTi LDH also showed outstanding stability and
reusability, making it one of the most promising materials for large-scale
wastewater remediation contaminated by dyes and antibiotics.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
contamination of water resources caused by organic pollutants
is a topic of great concern in the last few decades. Among all the
sources of pollution, pollution caused by organic dyes and antibiotics
in the aquatic system has become a serious threat for human health
and the environment.1 Removal of such water
soluble impurities has become very important but is a very tedious
job by conventional methods as such impurities easily get transported
through rivers and sewage systems.

Among the different water
contaminants, organic dyes are especially
known for their toxicity even at minute concentrations. Along with
their direct effect on health, organic dyes also cause other harmful
effects, such as consumption of oxygen molecules, reduction of water
transparency, alteration of the oxygen demand, and so on, and thus
deteriorate the aquatic life. Anionic as well as cationic dyes are
equally toxic, leading to gene mutations and cancer, and if they are
allowed to discharge in effluents, serious damage will be caused to
human lives.2

In the literature,
various reports have also shown the occurrence
of antibiotics in water bodies, sewage sludge, soil, and sediments.3 Antibiotics being a special and important group
of pharmaceuticals are used worldwide to control infectious diseases,
finding importance in animal husbandry and usage in aquaculture industries,
which led to a serious concern for their presence in the environment.
They are basically categorized into six classes (tetracyclines, macrolides,
β-lactams, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and other different
antibiotics).4 Among these antibiotics,
tetracycline (TC), which came into application for preserving human
health in the 1950s, contains three easily ionizable functional groups,
which gets protonated and deprotonated depending upon the pH of the
corresponding solutions (a predominantly cationic TC form below pH
3.3, a zwitterionic form within the range 3.3–7.7, and a dominantly
anionic form at pH greater than 7.7).5 Most
of the tetracycline on consumption by animals is excreted back to
the environment through urine (25–75%) and feces (70–90%),
which contaminates surface water and soil. Also, these lead to the
growth inhibition of various aquatic species, thus creating antibiotic
resistance in the microorganisms and endocrine disruption in the human
body.6

Thus, it is very important
to eliminate organic dye and antibiotic
residues from wastewater before they get discharged into nature. Recent
studies have shown that among all the well-known conventional methods
used for wastewater remediation such as electrochemical processes,
membrane filtration processes, photocatalytic processes, oxidation,
and ozonation,7−10 the adsorption process is considered to be the most efficient because
of its simplicity, less toxicity, and low cost for the elimination
of organic contaminants from effluents. Therefore, various structural
modifications and advancements have been made continuously to increase
the adsorption capacity of various conventional adsorbents. Among
all the reported adsorbents, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and
their modified forms came out as promising adsorbents for water remediation.

LDH, with the general formula [M(1–x)IIMxIII(OH)2]x+(An–)x/n·mH2O where MII is a divalent metal ion, MIII is a trivalent metal ion, and A is the intercalated anion,
is one of the most significant inorganic materials.11 Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) being a porous material
have gained huge importance in the field of adsorbents due to their
inherent structure, which is capable of capturing various hazardous
anionic water pollutants. LDHs generally follow three various mechanisms
for controlling such capture of anionic organic/inorganic pollutants,
namely, ion-exchange,12,13 van der Waals forces,14 and electrostatic attractions.15 Additionally, H-bonding interactions are also proposed
to be formed among the OH groups of LDHs and N- and O-containing groups
of adsorbates, but such interactions are found to play a limited role
in the adsorption process as only the free hydroxyl groups of the
sheets can take part in the interactions with the N-/O-containing
groups.16,17 To our knowledge, various LDHs and their
modified forms have been designed by various research groups and implemented
for water remediation, but none of them has shown outstanding results
for simultaneous removal of various organic contaminants (such as
dyes and antibiotics).18

Herein,
our group has designed a novel LDH material by using a
hydrothermal method. The resulting material was characterized by various
techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM), UV–vis spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption–desorption
techniques. In this study, we have used the designed adsorbent for
the removal of anionic organic water contaminants (methyl orange (MO),
orange II (OII), and tetracycline (TC)). Furthermore, the influences
of the various parameters such as solution pH, adsorbent dosage, contact
time, and initial dye/antibiotic concentrations were also evaluated.
Additionally, the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms were
analyzed for both organic contaminants using theoretical models. Further,
the adsorbent was also implemented to evaluate the simultaneous removal
of both the dye and antibiotic from the mixture of equal concentrations
of both contaminants. The reusability of the adsorbent was also tested.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of NiAlTi
LDH
The
XRD (X-ray diffraction) pattern of NiAlTi LDH is illustrated in Figure 1a. The recorded diffraction
peaks are found to be very compatible with previously reported data.19,43 The (00L) series diffraction peaks ((003), (006), (009)) are observed
at 11.44, 23.25, and 39.59°, respectively, indicating the existence
of a lamellar structure with the intercalation of carbonate ions and
water molecules within the lattice of the LDH. The d spacings with respect to reflection planes (003) and (110) were
0.773 nm (2θ = 11.438°) and 0.354 nm (2θ = 25.077°),
respectively. As the obtained basal spacing can be easily correlated
with the previously synthesized Ti-assimilated LDHs, the usual outcome
could be the formation of a pattern by the interlayered CO32– anions and H2O molecules. The existence
of the anatase phase of TiO2 in the designed LDH is verified
by the presence of diffraction planes (110) and (101) at 2θ
= 25.08 and 37.70°, respectively. The existence of sharp, intense,
and narrow peaks is attributed to the great crystallinity of the synthesized
NiAlTi LDH material. Moreover, the presence of peaks at 2θ values
of 35.00, 47.09, 62.48, and 75.18° shows the existence of other
reflections, (100), (018), (113), and (1013), respectively, indicating the typical LDH material with interlayered
carbonate ions and water molecules. Various XRD parameters are reported
in Table S1.

Figure 1 (a) XRD pattern, (b)
TGA, (c) FTIR spectrum, (d) UV–vis
spectrum, and (e) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm
of NiAlTi LDH.

The TGA curve of the designed
LDH material mainly exhibits two
degradation steps (Figure 1b). The first degradation step is observed in the temperature
range of 50–200 °C attributed to the elimination of the
physisorbed interlayered H2O molecules. The second degradation,
observed at 250–400 °C, is attributed to the brucite layer
dehydration and interlayered carbonate ion decomposition.19

The FTIR spectra of the synthesized LDH
material, depicted in Figure 1c, exhibited all
the characteristic frequencies related to the carbonated LDHs. The
absorption band present at 3288 cm–1 could be ascribed
to the stretching vibration due to the water molecules present on
the surface and to the interlayered ones within the LDH and hydroxyl
group. This stretching vibration occurs at lower wavenumbers as compared
to that of free water (3600 cm–1), which clearly
indicates the presence of H2O molecules placed between
the layers of synthesized NiAlTi LDH. The existence of the H bond
between the interlayered water molecules and CO32– ions is confirmed due to the presence of shoulders at 3101 and 2959
cm–1. The absorption band at 1638 cm–1 could be allotted to the bending mode of H2O molecules.
The vibrational bands at 1355, 1066, and 741 cm–1 could be due to the existence of CO32– ions. The presence of bands at 678 and 602 cm–1 could be attributed to M–OH and M–O bonds in synthesized
NiAlTi LDH. Thus, the FTIR analysis combined with other studies leads
to the confirmation of the existence of carbonate and water molecules
within the interlayer sheets of LDH.20 In
the UV–vis spectra of NiAlTi LDH (Figure 1d), an optical absorption band is observed
around 200–300 nm, which might be due to the ligand to metal
charge transfer in the octahedra of LDH. Further, the presence of
a strong adsorption band within the 250–450 nm range can be
attributed to the coordination of the metal with the intercalated
carbonate anions of the synthesized LDH material.19

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption study at
77 K clearly
indicates characteristic properties depicted by mesoporous materials.
The isotherm clearly indicates that the condensed N2 in
the pores followed distinct paths with the release of reduced pressure.
NiAlTi LDH followed a type-IV isotherm along with a broad H3-type
hysteresis loop (at P/P0 > 0.4) (Figure 1e).
The observed BET surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter of LDH
are 121.845 mg2/g, 0.212 cc/g, and 3.82 nm, respectively.19

SEM images of NiAlTi LDH are shown in Figure 2a,b. Platelet-like
structures are observed
in SEM images. The overlapping of these platelets results in the formation
of irregular particle sizes. TEM images of NiAlTi LDH are shown in Figure 2c,d. The TEM images
clearly indicate the non-uniform and irregular sheet-like morphology
of NiAlTi LDH.19 The EDAX analysis of NiAlTi
LDH, depicted in Figure S1, indicates that
the average elemental percentages of Ni, Al, and Ti are 22.32, 11.75
and 8.78%, respectively, and the approximate ratio of elements is
Ni/Al/Ti = 2:1:1.

2.2 Adsorption Study
NiAlTi LDH being
a porous layered material with additional properties of high BET surface
area was found to be a tremendous adsorbent for water remediation.
The adsorption process was evaluated by means of UV–vis spectroscopy
by assessing the variations in the characteristic peaks of different
organic pollutants. While accessing the data, a gradual decrease in
the characteristic peaks was observed with the progression of the
reaction, signifying a decrease in the concentrations of organic contaminants
(Figure S2). In the initial stage, the
dye removal efficiency of NiAlTi LDH was evaluated for a wide range
of dyes (methyl orange (MO), orange II (OII), methylene blue (MB),
and rhodamine B (RB)). It was observed from the data that both the
anionic dyes were almost completely eliminated (MO = 96.71% and OII
= 100%) from the synthetic wastewater solutions as compared to the
partial removal of the cationic dyes, (MB = 5% and RB = 14%) depicted
in Figure 3 (reaction
conditions: adsorbent amount, 4 mg; volume of dye sample, 10 mL; concentration
of initial dye sample, 20 mg/L; temperature, 25 ° C; and time,
60 min). Such behavior of NiAlTi LDH is observed because of the electrostatic
attraction between the negatively charged anionic dyes and positively
charged LDH host layers, which results in the complete adsorption
of MO and OII, whereas less adsorption of MB and RB was observed due
to electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged LDH layers
and cationic dyes.21 Therefore, NiAlTi
LDH is highly effective for the elimination of anionic over cationic
dyes, so the further studies were carried out only for anionic dyes
(MO and OII).

Figure 3 Dye removal efficiency of NiAlTi LDH for various dyes.

Primarily, the effect of pH variation on the dye
removal (%) efficiency
of the synthesized adsorbent was evaluated (reaction conditions: adsorbent
amount, 4 mg; volume of dye sample, 10 mL; concentration of initial
dye sample, 20 mg/L; temperature, 25 ° C; and time, 60 min).
From the experimental results, it was observed that both dyes (MO
and OII) illustrated analogous adsorption behavior at a selected pH
range (Figure 4a).
Results clearly displayed that the adsorption capacity slightly increased
as the pH of the reaction mixture increases from 4 to 8–9 and
greatly decreased as the pH further increases toward highly basic
conditions, that is, 12. According to the results, the maximum adsorption
capacity was obtained at pH 8 and 9, that is, 96.70% for MO and 100%
removal for OII (approximately equal cleaning efficiency for both
pH values). On lowering the pH toward the acidic side, we brought
the adsorbent more toward the dissolution process, which affected
the availability of active sites and further decreased the removal
efficiency from 96.70% (pH = 8) to 94.4% (pH = 4) when MO was used
as the adsorbate and 100% (pH = 8) to 96.04% (pH = 4) when OII was
employed. On increasing the pH toward the basic side, the negative
charge on the adsorbent surface also increases simultaneously, resulting
in higher electrostatic repulsion among the adsorbent surface and
anionic dye molecules.22 Hence, pH = 8
was carefully chosen as the optimum pH for further evaluation.

(a) pH, (b) adsorbent amount, (c) contact time, and
(d) initial antibiotic concentration on the adsorption process of
methyl orange and orange II over NiAlTi LDH.

Further, the optimum amount of adsorbent was investigated with
20 mg/L initial dye sample with varied adsorbent dosages (varying
from 0.1 to 1.2 g/L) at pH = 8 (depicted in Figure 4b). From the recorded data, it was observed
that the dye removal was efficient and rapid with complete removal
of MO and OII within several minutes. With the increasing amount of
adsorbent, the dye removal efficiency also rises and became almost
constant after a certain amount was added when maximum adsorption
efficiency was attained. The maximum adsorption efficiency (98.48%
(MO) and 100% (OII)) was attained with 0.4 g/L amount of NiAlTi LDH.
Hence, 0.4 g/L adsorbent dosage was selected as the optimum dosage
for dye removal. Also, further studies were carried out to estimate
the equilibrium time for the removal of dyes by determining the effects
of time on MO and OII removal, and the results are depicted in Figure 4c (reaction conditions:
adsorbent amount, 4 mg; volume of dye sample, 10 mL; concentration
of initial dye sample, 20 mg/L; temperature, 25 ° C; time, 1
h; and pH = 8). Equilibrium was achieved within 20 min for MO and
10 min for complete adsorption of OII from wastewater solution.

Also, the effect of initial MO and OII concentrations on the adsorption
process was studied with 0.4 g/L adsorbent amount and is depicted
in Figure 4d. The dye
removal efficiency (%) for MO remained almost the same when the initial
MO concentration varied from 20 to 150 mg/L, but on further increasing
the concentration up to 1000 mg/L, the removal efficiency declined
from 96.67% (150 mg/L) to 50.14% (1000 mg/L). A similar falling behavior
was detected for the OII dye, declining from 99% (at 500 mg/L) to
90.3% (1000 mg/L). Such a decline in removal efficiency is obtained
because of the presence of a fixed amount of adsorption sites in NiAlTi
LDH for a certain adsorbent dosage. After filling of these adsorption
sites, due to the absence of free active sites, the dye removal efficiency
fell with increasing concentration for both cases.

Additionally,
NiAlTi LDH performance for the adsorptive elimination
of antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewater was also evaluated.
For the adsorption of antibiotics, the pH of the solution is the key
factor for controlling the adsorption process. The solution pH has
a direct impact on the charge of the layers of the adsorbent and the
molecular structure of the antibiotic. For this study, the antibiotic
tetracycline (TC) was employed. Initially, the pH optimization was
carried out with 60 mg/L TC solution and is illustrated in Figure 5a. The results clearly
displayed an increasing slope with the increase in pH clearly pointing
toward the enhancement in the antibiotic removal efficiency of the
adsorbent. Maximum adsorption (98.164%) was attained at pH = 9, beyond
which the removal efficiency decreased with increasing pH. A low adsorption
capacity was observed at low pH values because of the complete protonation
of the molecule with a positive overall charge of the predominant
cationic tetracycline form due to which the electrostatic repulsion
occurs between the positive charge of cationic form of TC and layers
of the host material. With the increase of pH, deprotonation comes
into play, leading to the formation of anionic TC, which gets intercalated
within the LDH lattice, resulting in higher antibiotic removal. However,
at greater pH values, electrostatic repulsion between the anionic
form of TC and increased negative charge on the surface of the adsorbent
plays a key role in the decrease in the adsorptive efficiency of NiAlTi
LDH.

Figure 5 Effects of (a) pH, (b) adsorbent amount, (c) contact time, and
(d) initial antibiotic concentration on the adsorption process of
tetracycline over NiAlTi LDH.

Further, the optimum amount of NiAlTi LDH for TC removal was determined
with 60 mg/L TC solution at pH = 9. Figure 5b depicts the influence of adsorbent dosage
on the elimination of TC from the TC synthetic sample. From the experimental
data, it was evaluated that the maximum adsorption was achieved with
a 1.6 g/L (16 mg of adsorbent for 60 mg/L TC sample (10 mL)) adsorbent
dosage. Time variation was further evaluated to determine the equilibrium
time of the adsorption process and is depicted in Figure 5c. The rate of adsorption was
found to be very fast and achieved equilibrium 20 min from the start
of the reaction. Additionally, the effect of variation in the concentration
of the initial TC sample is depicted in Figure 5d. At lower concentrations up
to 60 mg/L TC sample, the adsorbent was found to be highly efficient
with 100% elimination of TC. On further increasing the concentration,
the removal efficiency decreased and reduced to approximately half,
that is, 53.08% at 700 mg/L initial TC concentration. Such behavior
is obtained because the adsorbent consists of a fixed number of active
sites and, at higher concentrations, when these sites are completely
filled, the TC adsorption decreases with the rise in the concentration.

2.3 Kinetics Study
The kinetics experimental
data was fitted to kinetic models (pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order)
to study the adsorption behavior of NiAlTi LDH toward anionic dyes
and antibiotics. According to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model
(eq 1) 1  where qe and qt represents the amount
of MO, OII, and TC adsorbed at equilibrium time and at time t, respectively, and k1 denotes
the reaction rate constant. The slope of the linear plot between log(qe – qt) and
time t gives us k1. The
pseudo-first-order kinetic plots are shown in Figure 6a,b for MO and OII and in Figure 8a for TC.

Figure 6 Pseudo-first-order kinetics
plots for (a) methyl orange and (b)
orange II and pseudo-second-order kinetics plots for (c) methyl orange
and (d) orange II.

According to the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model (eq 2),
the adsorption rate is controlled
by the chemical adsorption. The pseudo-second-order equation is depicted
as 2  where k2 is the second-order adsorption rate constant and qe and R2 are calculated
from the constants (slope and intercept) obtained from the linear
plot between t/qt and t. Pseudo-second-order plots of MO and OII are illustrated
in Figure 6c,d, and
that of TC is illustrated in Figure 8b. All the constants and R2 values are summarized in Table 1. It could be easily stated from the results that adsorption
of MO, OII, and TC onto NiAlTi LDH was found to follow the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model based on the R2 values,
which were almost close to unity in all the three cases.

TC	1.755	0.1382	0.649	37.174	0.0664	0.999	
2.4 Isotherm
Study
Langmuir and Freundlich
equations were used to evaluate the adsorption isotherms. According
to the Langmuir isotherm model, the adsorption energy is assumed to
be constant. It is also assumed that the molecules of the adsorbate
do not hold any kind of interactions during the adsorption.23 The Langmuir isotherm linear equation is denoted
as 3  where Ce (mg/L) represents the equilibrium
concentration of the dye
or antibiotic used and qe (mg/g) represents
the amount of dye/antibiotic adsorbed per unit adsorbent. qm (mg/g) and b (L/mg) are the
Langmuir constants obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot
between Ce/qe and Ce, respectively. Both the constants
are interrelated with the adsorption rate and capacity. One of the
Langmuir equation’s essential characteristics can be expressed
as dimensionless RL (separation factor),
which is denoted by 4  where C0 represents the initial dye/ antibiotic concentration. From
the RL value, we can detect whether the
adsorption is favorable (0 < RL <
1), unfavorable (RL > 1), linear (RL = 1), or irreversible (RL = 0). The Freundlich model that is based on the assumption
that non-uniform distribution of heat occurs over heterogeneous surfaces
is given by 5  where qe and Ce have their usual meanings. Kf and n represents Freundlich
constants, which are basically related to both adsorption capacity
and intensity, respectively. Both the constants (Kf and n) are obtained from the intercept
and slope of the linear plot between log qe and log Ce, respectively. The model
fitting for MO and OII is depicted in Figure 7 and for TC in Figure 8c,d. All the parameters
obtained from the isotherm studies are reported in Table 2. From the data depicted in Table 2, it can be stated
that the Langmuir model gave greater correlation coefficient values
(R2) for all the three contaminants, which
clearly indicates that the adsorption over the adsorbent is a monolayer.
From the obtained RL values depicted in Figure S3, which lie completely between 0 and
1 for all the contaminants, it can be concluded that the adsorption
process was favorable and consisted of homogeneous patches. On comparison
of the obtained maximum adsorption capacities for MO, OII, and TC
with previously reported adsorbents, it could be easily stated that
our material NiAlTi LDH showed greater adsorption capacity for both
types of pollutants (dyes and antibiotics) among all the previously
reported adsorbents (Table 3).18,22,25−42 Therefore, our material exhibits excellent adsorption properties
for different types of pollutants and could be considered as a potential
adsorbent for the elimination of various organic contaminants from
waste water systems.

The mechanism behind the adsorption of MO, OII, and TC over synthesized
NiAlTi LDH was investigated using FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR spectra
of LDH before and after the adsorption of contaminants are depicted
in Figure 9a. The intercalation
of MO, OII, and TC into NiAlTi LDH can be confirmed by the formation
of new vibrational bands occurring in the region of 1300–1000
cm–1. In the case of intercalation of MO, these
new vibrational bands at 1029 and 1119 cm–1 could
be attributed to the vibrations due to the −SO3– group of MO and the 1,4-substituted benzene ring.
The presence of new bands at 1166 and 1606 cm–1 could
be due to the stretching vibrations of C–N and C=C bonds
of MO molecules, respectively. Similar bands were observed in the
case of the OII dye. In the case of tetracycline adsorption, new vibrational
bands at 1356 and 1616 cm–1, which are the main
vibrational bands of TC, confirm the adsorption of TC over the surface.
In all the three cases, disappearance of the vibrational band at 1355
cm–1 as compared to the raw LDH FTIR spectra reveals
the elimination of carbonate ions and intercalation of dye/antibiotic
molecules, which leads to the conclusion that the mechanism behind
such adsorption could be the ion exchange mechanism (Figure 9b).24

The exhausted NiAlTi LDH was regenerated
and its recyclability
was carried out for five consecutive cycles. The removal efficiency
of regenerated NiAlTi LDH for every consecutive cycle is depicted
in Figure 10. From
the bar results, it could be clearly inferred that even after the
fifth cycle, the efficiency of NiAlTi LDH was found to be >95%
for
all the three contaminants. Thus, it can be concluded from the recyclability
results that NiAlTi LDH is easily recoverable, can be easily regenerated,
and is highly stable and highly efficient for eliminating organic
contaminants from water. The cleaning efficiency of NiAlTi LDH was
also evaluated for the mixture of a dye (MO) and an antibiotic (TC)
(reaction conditions: adsorbent dosage = 4 mg, MO concentration =
20 mg/L, TC concentration = 20 mg/L, volume of solution = 10 mL, temperature
= 25 ° C, pH = 9, time = 60 min). From the results, NiAlTi LDH
was found to be an excellent adsorbent to eliminate both the contaminants
from the mixture with a great removal efficiency of 99% for MO and
98% for TC. Thus, NiAlTi LDH is an excellent adsorbent for simultaneous
removal of MO and TC.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we have successfully
designed and synthesized a
novel and highly pure NiAlTi LDH by using a hydrothermal method. The
synthesized material was implemented for the elimination of organic
contaminants (dyes and antibiotics) from waste solutions. The as-prepared
NiAlTi LDH with a high surface area resulted in excellent elimination
of organic water contaminants. The observed adsorption equilibrium
times are 20 min for MO, 10 min for OII, and 20 min for TC. The attained
maximum adsorption capacity was superb for both organic dyes and antibiotics
(1250 mg/g for MO, 2000 mg/g for OII, and 238.09 mg/g for TC). The
active pH and NiAlTi LDH dosage for complete removal of dyes were
8 and 0.4 g/L (for 20 ppm concentrated dye solution) and those for
complete elimination of antibiotic (TC) were 9 and 1.6 g/L (for 60
ppm concentrated antibiotic solution), respectively. Both pollutants
were found to be easily correlated with the pseudo-second-order kinetic
model for the adsorption process. The Langmuir isotherm adsorption
model fitted the experimental results for both types of pollutants
very well. Also, NiAlTi LDH was capable of simultaneous elimination
of antibiotics and dyes. Further, NiAlTi LDH also showed outstanding
stability and reusability, making it one of the most promising materials
for large-scale wastewater remediation contaminated by dyes and antibiotics.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All
the chemicals used
in this study were commercially available and used as supplied without
further purification. Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, methyl orange,
and orange II were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, nickel nitrate hexahydrate
from THOMAS BAKER, titanium tetrachloride from LOBA CHEMIA, and tetracycline
hydrochloride from SRL. All other chemicals were procured from commercial
suppliers.

4.2 Synthesis of NiAlTi Layered
Double Hydroxide
NiAlTi LDH was synthesized by a hydrothermal
route. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (5.49 g),
3.540 g of Al(NO3)2·9H2O, 0.6
mL of TiCl4, and 1.5 g of urea (used as a template, which
on hydrolysis during
hydrothermal treatment gives carbonate and ammonium ions) were dissolved
in deionized water. The mixture was transferred to an autoclave and
aged hydrothermally for 40 h at 160 °C. The product so-obtained
was extracted, washed with deionized water, and dried for 24 h at
60 °C.43

4.3 Characterization
The synthesized
NiAlTi LDH was characterized for its phase purity, crystal structure,
morphology, and specific surface area. The LDH morphology was examined
by using a JEOL JSM 6610 SEM with an accelerating voltage of 30 kV
and a TECNAI 200 kV HRTEM (Fei, Electron Optics). The BET specific
surface area of LDH was examined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method on an Autosorb iQ Station 1 (Quantachrome Instruments).
The FTIR spectrum was investigated on an IRAffinity-1S FTIR (Shimadzu).
The phase purity and crystallinity were evaluated using an X-ray diffractometer
(model no. D8 DISCOVER). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was determined
using a LINSEIS L40/2052. Adsorption studies were estimated using
a Thermo Scientific Evolution 300 UV–vis spectrometer.

4.4 Adsorption Experiments
The dye and
antibiotic adsorption over NiAlTi LDH was evaluated as batch experiments.
Effects of certain parameters—time, pH, adsorbent amount, and
initial dye/antibiotic concentrations—were evaluated. For the
dye adsorption experiments, initially, the effect of pH variation
was studied within a pH range (4–12) and the optimum pH of
the initial dye solution was adjusted via 0.1 N HCl and 0.1 N NaOH.
Then, the effect of adsorbent amount was studied within the range
of 0.1–1.2 g/L. Further, a kinetics study was conducted with
0.4 g/L adsorbent concentration and 20 ppm initial dye concentration
at the optimum pH of the solution. Then, the adsorption isotherms
were also evaluated with initial dye concentrations varying within
the range of 10–1000 mg/L. Similarly, an antibiotic adsorption
study was also conducted. Additionally, the recyclability of the adsorbent
was also evaluated for the dyes and antibiotics by the method described
below. The adsorbent was recovered by centrifugation after the reaction
has attained equilibrium and washed with deionized water to remove
leftover dye/antibiotic molecules. The adsorbent was further allowed
to stir in 30 mL of ethanol for 6 h. Finally, the adsorbent was separated,
washed with decarbonated water, dried, and applied for the next adsorption
cycle. The reusability was studied for five cycles. The residual dye/antibiotic
concentrations were estimated by using a UV–vis spectroscope
(Thermo Scientific Evolution 300), and the adsorption capacity was
evaluated using the conventional equation 6  where C0 represents the initial dye/antibiotic concentration (mg/L), Ce represents the equilibrium dye/antibiotic
concentration (mg/L), m represents the mass of the
LDH adsorbent used (g), and V represents the volume
of dye/antibiotic solution in liters.
