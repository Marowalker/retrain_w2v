A green, mussel-inspired bioadhesive
based on oligomerization of
hydrocaffeic acid was synthesized in water by an ultrafast one-step
reaction in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
as an activating agent. The resulting oligomers exhibited strong wet
adhesion when applied to different substrates including glass, stainless
steel, and aluminum. Compared to most commercial adhesives, this bioinspired
adhesive is produced via a sustainable and green process, i.e., aqueous-based
synthesis, one-step reaction, and in the absence of any purification
step to obtain the final functional adhesive.

==== Body
Introduction
Most known commercial
adhesives are restricted to limited number
of surfaces and are often not effective in wet environments.1,2 These limitations are circumvented by mussels, which secrete proteinaceous
threads (byssus) containing adhesive proteins at the extremity of
their byssus, allowing them to attach to a wide range of solid substrates
(both inorganic and organic), and more remarkably, under a wet environment.3−6 To accomplish this feat, mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) utilize
exquisite biochemical and bioprocessing tricks. The most familiar
is the incorporation of the post-translated amino acid 3,4-dihydroxylphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA) in MAPs,7 a catechol derivative of tyrosine which is able to form various
intermolecular interactions that adapt to the surface chemistry, including
coordination bonds,8,9 hydrogen bonds,10,11 as well as hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions.12,13 More recently, additional characteristics of MAPs have been shown
to enable their water-resistant adhesion capacity, including: (i)
the use of redox coupling between MAPs to prevent premature oxidation
of DOPA into their less-adhesive quinone form;14 (ii) their secretion as a nondispersible coacervate fluid
that allows the adhesive to be delivered in high concentration at
the attachment site;15,16 (iii) the synergistic effect
of basic sidechains adjacent to l-DOPA in MAPs that displace
hydrated cations from oxide surfaces;17 and (iv) their capacity to form π–cation interactions
that can further enhance adhesion in immersed environments.18

Because characteristics (i–iv)
have more recently been revealed,
so far most efforts to duplicate the adhesive properties of MAPs have
focused on strategies to synthesize catechol-containing adhesive polymers,
including auto-oxidation of dopamine,19 pendant functionalization of naturally occurring polysaccharides20−26 or modified poly(ethylene glycol),27−31 enzymatic modification of tyrosine-bearing polymers,32 and using different polymerization techniques
(conventional and controlled/living polymerizations).33−36 A number of reviews have documented the synthesis of catechol-based
polymers and their adhesion mechanisms.11,37−41 To our knowledge, the only example of a polyester catecholic polymer
synthesized by a condensation reaction is the work of Kaneko and co-workers.42,43 In their study, caffeic acid was co-polymerized with 4-coumaric
acid in the presence of acetic anhydride as a condensation agent and
disodium hydrogen phosphate as a transesterification catalyst. The
resulting hyperbranched polymer showed interesting adhesive properties
in dry conditions when applied to copper and stainless steel surfaces,
which nearly matched commercial cyanoacrylate glues.

Other important
requirements for streamlined production of adhesives
are the synthesis process, the nature of the solvent, and a minimum
number of purification steps to obtain the final product. Herein,
we report a facile and fast (less than 1 min), one-step synthesis
of a wet-resistant adhesive synthesized by oligomerization of the
catecholic compound hydrocaffeic acid (HCA). We used a direct, water-based,
and fast auto-condensation reaction process, and the final functional
adhesive could be obtained without any purification step.

Results and Discussion
To synthesize the oligo(HCA) adhesive, HCA was reacted with itself
in the presence of a concentrated solution of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide (EDC) acting as an activating agent at room temperature
and under vigorous stirring, leading to the immediate formation of
a brown gluey precipitate (Figure 1). The exothermic nature of the reaction accelerated
the rate of condensation between the OH groups of the benzene ring
with the carboxylic group to form an ester bond. Hence a large amount
of HCA could condense in a short amount of time, leading to a mixture
of linear and branched oligomers with abundant catechol groups in
the chain ends.43 The reaction mixture
was decanted, and the adhesive was then washed and kept overnight
in water to remove any unreacted reagents as well as any urea formed
during the reaction, and then stored at −20 °C without
drying until use.

Figure 1 Synthesis (A) and a possible structure (B) of oligo(HCA)
adhesive
showing the linear, dendritic, and terminal units. The drawing is
for the oligomer with six repeating units.

To assess the structure of the synthesized adhesive, 1H NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy measurements were done on the freeze-dried product (Figure 2). On the 1H NMR spectrum, characteristic peaks of the oligo(HCA) appeared between
6.5 and 7.2 ppm, which can be attributed to protons from the aromatic
region as well as the aliphatic peaks at ∼2.8 ppm. Only traces
of impurities (represented by the cross signs) were left in the adhesive
after it was washed in water, which suggests that no purification
step is necessary for the product to display its adhesive functionality.
It is worth noting that the 1H NMR spectrum of the adhesive
obtained directly after the reaction and without washing (see Supporting Information) indicated slight evidence
of unreacted hydrocaffeic acid, with a 1:10 ratio of HCA to oligo(HCA)
implying a high conversion of HCA to oligo(HCA) of ca. 90%. To calculate
the degree of branching (DB), the peaks related to the terminal T
(two phenolic OH), linear L (one phenolic OH), and dendritic D (no
phenolic OH) protons of the aromatic ring were assigned (see Supporting
Information for spectrum, Figure S1). The
set of peaks between 7.0 and 7.3 ppm could be attributed to the dendritic
units, whereas the peaks at 6.8 and 6.5 ppm were assigned to H5 and
and H2/H6 linear units. Finally the peaks at 6.64 and 6.66 ppm were
attributed to the terminal protons.44 DB
was then calculated based on the study of Hawker et al.45 and was found to be ∼54% using the equation  where AD, AT, and AL are the
integrated areas from the dendritic, terminal, and linear protons,
respectively.

synthesized adhesive oligo(HCA). Conditions: Oligo(HCA), 40 mg mL–1, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/CD3OD, 298
K, ns = 32, D1 = 3 s. The crosses represent impurities in the adhesive.
Both spectra were referenced with respect to the DMSO peak at δppm = 2.5. Additional spectra with peaks attributed to dendritic,
linear, and terminal units are shown in Supporting Information, Figure S1. (C) FTIR and (D) MALDI-ToF spectra
of the synthesized oligo(HCA) adhesive. For the MALDI-ToF spectrum,
the degree of polymerization (X) of the corresponding oligomers is
shown. 164 Da corresponds to the repeating unit C9H8O3, whereas the 30 Da difference shoulder peak
could not be attributed.

The adhesive was further evaluated by FTIR spectroscopy,
as shown
in Figure 2C. The appearance
of a characteristic peak at 1735 cm–1 can be attributed
to the C=O stretching of the ester group and indicated the
formation of an ester bond. This was accompanied by broadening of
the 1110 cm–1 band that could be attributed to the
C–O bond of the ester group or to the C–O bond of the
catechol ring, as well as by the disappearance of the C=O stretching
band of the carboxylic group of HCA at 1669 cm–1.46 These features suggested the condensation
of OH groups from the catechol ring with the carboxyl group (COOH)
of HCA that led to the formation of an ester bond.

Under these
concentrated conditions, EDC acted as an activating
agent and accelerated the process. The presence of two OH groups on
the benzene ring likely led to the formation of a branched ester.43

It is worth noting that the reaction between
dopamine (which does
not contain carboxylic group) and EDC following the same reaction
conditions did not result in the formation of the precipitate adhesive
(data not shown), which supports the importance of the carboxylic
groups during adhesive synthesis through the formation of the ester
bond. From the MALDI-ToF analysis (Figure 2D), oligomers of 3–22 repeating units
were observed, with the shorter oligomers as the dominant species.
A difference of m/z ≅ 164
between two consecutive peaks was detected, confirming the mass of
the simplest repeating unit with a chemical formula of C9H8O3 corresponding to two HCA molecules minus
one H2O molecule formed during the condensation reaction.

To evaluate the adhesive properties of the oligomers, the adhesive
was spread from the hydrated state on one of the two rectangular surfaces
of the selected substrates, i.e., glass, aluminum (Al), or stainless
steel in wet conditions, clamped against the other surface, and dried
at 60 °C for 12 h before testing. Two sets of mechanical testing
were conducted using the lap-shear test,47 one with nontreated and the other with vacuum-plasma-treated substrates.
For comparison, a commercial cyanoacrylate glue (Selley Pty limited)
was used as a control for untreated Al and stainless steel substrates,
and was applied in dry conditions as it did not display adhesion in
the wet state. The failure stress from the lap-shear experiments are
shown in Figure 3 for
the three substrates.

Figure 3 Lap-shear adhesion measurements of the oligo(HCA) adhesive
on different
substrates and comparison with a commercial cyanoacrylate glue.

The adhesive exhibited higher
failure stress with the stainless
steel (1.27 ± 0.21 MPa) substrate than Al (1.1 ± 0.28 MPa)
and glass (0.3 ± 0.08 MPa) substrates. This could be attributed
to stronger H-bonding and coordination bond interactions between the
catechol residues with Al and stainless steel surfaces than the glass
substrate, where only H-bonding would predominate.11,39,48 A similar trend was observed with the commercial
cyanoacrylate adhesive, which showed higher failure stress than our
synthesized adhesive on both Al (1.1 vs 2.2 MPa) and stainless steel
(1.27 vs 2.8 MPa) substrates. It should also be noted that the oligo(HCA)
adhesive exhibited a brittle type of failure on Al and stainless steel
substrates compared to the glass substrate, for which a slight ductile
behavior was noticed with relatively large failure strains and areas
under the load/displacement curves (Supporting Information). The commercial glue showed more pronounced brittle
failure for all tested substrates.

To enhance the adhesive properties
of the synthesized oligo(HCA),
the substrates were vacuum-plasma treated for 10 min prior to the
adhesion process to obtain a cleaner surface and introduce more free
hydroxyl groups on the surface for enhanced molecular interactions.
As expected, the failure stress increased with the treated surfaces
for the three substrates (0.5 ± 0.03 MPa (glass), 1.8 ±
0.20 MPa (aluminum), and 1.7 ± 0.11 MPa (stainless steel)). Although
the shear strength of oligo(HCA) is lower than that of the commercial
cynaoacrylate, values exceeding 1 MPa can still be categorized as
a robust adhesive, which would be adequate in several applications.47,49 On the other hand, the oligo(HCA) can be applied on wet surfaces,
which is a critical advantage over other types of adhesives, and we
attribute this capability to the presence of catecholic moieties in
its chemical structure.

In all substrates, we also observed
a cohesive failure mode since
remnants of the adhesive was observed on both sides of the substrate,
which we attribute to the presence of mostly oligomeric chains in
our adhesive that limit interchain entanglement interactions. We anticipate
that higher chain entanglement may further enhance adhesion strength
by increasing the interchain cohesion forces. For example, the incorporation
of Fe3+ as complexing ions20,27,50,51 or periodate ions52,53 to oxidize the catechols and trigger covalent cross-linking may
increase the molecular weight of the adhesive complex and enhance
cohesive forces, although this may also come at the expense of the
number of catechol units available for adhesive interfacial interactions.
Therefore, it is likely that a compromise would exist between cohesive
and adhesive forces to achieve the best adhesive properties.

A comparative summary with bioinspired catecholic adhesives applied
in both dry and wet conditions allows us to benchmark our adhesive.
For example, the shear bond strength of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate-filled
coacervate adhesive was found to be 1.2 MPa on wet glass substrates.54 Water-soluble polyoxetane adhesive decorated
with catechol and bisphosphoric acid groups exhibited an adhesion
strength of 0.35 MPa in humid conditions as measured by bulk lap-shear
joints between aluminum substrates.55 The
bond strengths of a poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymer functionalized
with catechol residues50 and a catechol-functionalized
polyacrylate56 applied to wet glass were
found to be 1.3 and 1.6 MPa, respectively. More recently, a poly(catechol-styrene)
adhesive led to shear bond strengths up to ∼3 MPa on aluminum
substrates in wet environments.57 According
to the authors, this represents the highest underwater adhesive developed
to date. The same adhesive was also tested in dry conditions, and
bond strengths of 4 MPa (without periodate) and 7 MPa (with periodate)
were measured on aluminum surfaces, 5–6 MPa on steel surfaces,
and up to 10 MPa on wood surfaces. Catechol-based adhesives applied
in dry/slightly wet states have also been reported. A co-polypeptide
decorated with DOPA residues exhibited bond strengths of ∼2.5,
∼2.7, and ∼4.7 MPa on glass, steel, and aluminum substrates,
respectively, after curing at high temperatures.58 In summary, bond strengths of our bioinspired adhesive
reside between those previously obtained on wet and dry surfaces for
catechol-based adhesives. However, the specific advantage of our adhesive
is its simple synthesis and the green processing (from synthesis to
purification) by which it is obtained, and we also envisage that its
performance could be enhanced by promoting intermolecular cohesive
forces within the complex.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
prepared a bioinspired catechol-based adhesive
using a simple, one-pot reaction methodology synthesized from the
aqueous soluble precursor HCA, and the entire process of adhesive
synthesis takes less than 1 min. After oligomerization, oligo(HCA)
exhibits adhesive properties that can be used to bond different types
of substrates, including Al, stainless steel, and glass. Importantly,
the adhesive can be applied on wet surfaces. We consider that the
lower adhesion strength of our oligo(HCA) compared to commercial glues
such as cyanoacrylate represents an acceptable compromise in the light
of the sustainable process by which the adhesive is produced, notably
water-based synthesis, fast one-step reaction, and the absence of
any purification step before final usage as a multipurpose glue.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The following chemicals were of reagent grade
and were used as received. Hydrocaffeic acid (HCA, 98%, Alfa Aesar)
and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC, 98%, Gl biochemicals)
were used. Deionized water was produced in-house with a Milli-Q apparatus
(Millipore) and used for all experiments. Aluminum and stainless steel
rectangular plates were purchased from Kim Hwee Industrial Technology,
and the glass plates (microscope slides) were provided by Biomedia.

General Methods
Accurate volumes (10–1000 μL)
were measured with calibrated automatic pipettes (Eppendorf Research).

Synthesis of oligo(HCA)
In a typical experiment, hydrocaffeic
acid HCA (1 g, 5.48 mmol, 1 equiv) and EDC (1.05 g, 5.48 mmol, 1 equiv)
solutions were prepared by dissolving the corresponding reagents in
3 and 1 mL water, respectively. To the HCA solution, the EDC solution
was added in one portion under vigorous stirring at RT. In less than
1 min, the oligo(HCA) precipitated out of the solution. The product
was recovered, kept overnight in water, and stored in a freezer without
drying until use. The reader is referred to Supporting InformationVideo 1 as an illustration of the reaction, demonstrating
the ease and fast speed of synthesis. We also stored the adhesive
at room temperature in water for up to 2 months. The oligomeric adhesive
remained in the precipitate state and did not resolubilize, thus demonstrating
that the ester bond of the oligomeric adhesive did not hydrolyze and
remained stable.

Analytical Techniques
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR)
Spectra were acquired
on a Bruker Avance I spectrometer equipped with a variable temperature
module (resonance frequency of 400.13 MHz for 1H) and a
QNP probe. Unless otherwise specified, for 1H experiments,
90° pulses and pulse sequence recycle times of 3 s were used.
One-dimensional 1H spectra were obtained with 32 scans
and 32 K data points and were reprocessed using MestReNova software
(v6.2). Chemical shifts were referenced with respect to the DMSO peak
(δDMSO = 2.5 ppm at 298 K).

Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption
Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-ToF)
MALDI-ToF analyses
were performed using a Kratos Axima Performance
(Kratos-Shimadzu Biotech, Manchester, U.K.) equipped with a pulsed
N2 laser (λ = 337 nm) and a time-delayed extraction
ion source. An accelerating voltage of 20 kV was used. The spectrometer
was operated in positive ion linear mode, and mass spectra were obtained
by accumulating 1000 laser shots for each analysis at a power of 110
with Rastering mode on. The matrix, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB),
was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (20 mg mL–1). Sample
was solubilized in dimethylformamide (8 mg L–1)
and mixed with DHB (1:10 ratio). The mixture was then deposited onto
a MALDI plate and dried at room temperature before analysis.

Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
A Vertex
70 instrument (Bruker) was employed in the attenuated total reflection
mode, with 64 scans and a resolution of 4 cm–1 in
the 4000–400 cm–1 region. The solid freeze-dried
product was directly analyzed. The data were processed using OPUS
6.5 software (Bruker) and replotted on origin 8.

Lap-Shear
Adhesion Measurements
Lap-shear adhesion
measurements were performed using an Instron 5567 testing system equipped
with 500 N load cell (unless specified) at RT. Adherends were pulled
apart at a rate of 1 mm min–1. The dimensions of
Al and stainless steel rectangular plates were 80 mm long and 12 mm
wide, and the overlap bonded region was ≅ 10–15 mm long.
For the glass plates, standard microscopic slides (25 mm × 75
mm) were used with an overlap bonded region of ≅12–19
mm long. The failure stress was obtained by dividing the maximum load
(N) by the area of the adhesive overlap, giving the lap-shear adhesion
in Pa (Pa = N m–2). To this end, the wet oligo(HCA)
adhesive was smeared on one of the two rectangular surfaces of a selected
material (glass, aluminum, or stainless steel), clamped to the other
surface, and maintained at 60 °C for 12 h before analysis. In
all experiments, the adhesive was applied directly from the hydrated
state. For each material, 10 experiments were conducted.

Cleaning
of Substrates
All substrates (treated or nontreated)
were washed with ethanol and water, then flushed with air prior to
adhesion to remove any dust or other contaminants on the surface.
Following this, the surfaces were hydrated to conduct testing corresponding
to a wet application.

Vacuum Plasma Treatment
Vacuum plasma
treatments were
conducted using a plasma cleaner from Harrick Plasma. The substrate
was placed inside a plasma chamber, vacuum was reduced to 200 mTorr,
and then O2 was flown inside the chamber to insure a vacuum
of 700 mbar during the plasma treatment.
