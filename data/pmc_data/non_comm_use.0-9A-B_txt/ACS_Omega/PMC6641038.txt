Anderson localization
of light and random lasing in this critical
regime is an open research frontier, which besides being a basic research
topic could also lead to important applications. This article investigates
the random laser action at the localization transition in a strongly
disordered scattering medium composed of a colloidal suspension of
core–shell nanoparticles (TiO2@Silica) in ethanol
solution of Rhodamine 6G. The classical superfluorescence band of
the random laser was measured separately by collecting the emission
at the back of the samples, showing a linear dependence with pumping
fluence without gain depletion. However, frontal collection showed
saturation of the absorption and emission. Narrow peaks of approximately
equal intensity are observed on top of the classical superfluorescence
band, indicating suppression of the interaction between the peaks
modes. The linewidth of these peaks is lower than that of the passive
modes of the scattering medium. A method called fraction of absorbed
pumping allowed us to infer that this peak’s mode (localized
modes) is confined to a shallow region near the input-pumping border.

Introduction
Scattering media have
attracted much attention in recent years,
ranging from investigations into fundamental topics, such as light
confinement1−5 and other phenomena involving photon interactions,6,7 to their potential applications in solar energy,8 photocatalyzers,9 and random
lasers (RL).10−12 Localization of light and a wide variety of associated
phenomena have greatly attracted the attention of researchers in the
past decades. In a previous work,5 we reported
several pieces of experimental evidence of localization transition
in a colloidal suspension composed of TiO2@Silica nanoparticles
(NPs) in ethanol solution. By using the Stöber method,13,14 TiO2 NPs were coated with a homogeneous silica shell
of ∼40 nm thickness. The silica shell provides optical colloidal
stability (OCS),15,16 light-coupling enhancement with
the TiO2 scatterer core,17 high
dispersibility of NPs,18−20 and inertness,21,22 which have enabled
their use in numerous applications.23−25 The silica coating with
thicknesses above ∼40 nm prevents the “optical”
junction of the TiO2 scattering surfaces (steric “optical”
effect),15 decreasing considerably the
near-field coupling, which decreases the scattering strength and could
hamper localization.16 We called this property
OCS.15 The core–shell TiO2@Silica NPs allowed us to obtain a liquid suspension with a significantly
higher scattering strength than pure rutile particles. Transport experiments
in this TiO2@Silica colloidal suspension showed a crossover
from diffusive light propagation to localization transition as the
NP concentration increased, and an enhanced absorption at the localization
transition was observed.5 The study of
the RL action at this critical regime of approaching localization
is an open research frontier. It has been shown that a scattering
medium with gain at the localization or localization transition can
lead to random lasing with coherent feedback,26,27 which besides being a fundamental topic11 could also present significant applications.28 Another alternative scattering medium for localization
of light and random nanolasing (spaser) has been the plasmonic NPs,
which was experimentally demonstrated by Noginov and co-workers.29

In this work, random lasing is studied
at the localization transition.
Narrow peaks arising in the RL emission spectrum are observed. This
kind of peaks has been reported in systems composed by solid powders,30,31 porous gallium phosphide filled with liquid dye solution,32 sparse clusters,33 photonic crystals,34,12 and in low dimensional systems.35−37 Spikes have also been observed over a broad range of scattering
strengths.38 However, recent works39,40 claim that, depending on the relative magnitude of the localization
length and the system size, quasi modes and lasing modes may not be
the same, and the statistical distribution of these emission spikes
is an indication that under certain pumping conditions they do not
correspond to true lasing with coherent feedback. Detailed reviews
on this topic have been published elsewhere.41,42

Results and Discussion
Analysis of Laser Emission
Figure 1a shows the behavior
of the emitted intensity
as a function of pumping energy fluence. Typical RL emission spectra
and the behavior of the spectral width (full width at half-maximum
(FWHM)) can be found in Figure S2. From Figure 1a, we can observe
that the RL slope efficiency (RLeff) is not constant; it
decreases markedly for pumping fluencies from ∼12 up to 36
mJ cm–2, showing a saturation of the emission. The
green line represents the RLeff for fluencies <12 mJ
cm–2. For pumping fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2, RLeff adopts a 2.3 times smaller value
(blue line). The RL threshold, determined by extrapolating the straight
line corresponding to RLeff (green line) to a zero emission
intensity, is ∼1.2 mJ cm–2 (Supporting Information). The light of the pumping pulse reflected
by the samples was measured with and without R6G. We designated the
ratio between the pumping intensities reflected by the scattering
medium with and without R6G as the fraction of absorbed pumping (FAP),
which represents the absorbance of the sample, ln(FAP).15 FAP dependence with pumping energy fluence is
shown in Figure 1b.
The FAP value for fluencies <0.048 mJ cm–2, well
below the laser threshold (FAPbT), was constant (∼1.5).
The FAP value decreases quickly for fluencies of 0.048 up to 0.36
mJ cm–2. For fluencies between 0.36 and 4.8 mJ cm–2, the FAP values decrease slowly from 1.34 down to
1.28, where it remains approximately constant up to a fluence of 8.4
mJ cm–2. The FAP values start to drop quickly again
for fluencies >8.4 mJ cm–2 and decrease down
to
∼1.15 for fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2, showing
a clear phase transition for the absorption, indicating two different
modes of laser operation. From the FAPbT value (1.5), we
can estimate the average photon path length (leO) inside the scattering medium before being reflected, as
well as the photon residence time (τeO).15 1   2  where la, γ0, neff0, neff, and c are the ballistic or microscopic
absorption length [R6G], the enhanced absorption factor by localization
(γ0 = 1.84),5 the effective
refractive index (increased by localization), the classical refractive
index (1.53), and speed of light, respectively. The la value well below the laser threshold (passive regime)
should not change (384 μm at [10–4 M] of R6G).
However, just as it was determined in our previous work,5 the absorption coefficient and the effective
refractive index are enhanced near the input-pumping surface . The
term  represents an estimate of the mean value
of the enhanced absorption factor in the region where absorption is
enhanced (Supporting Information). In this
way, the photon path length and the photon residence time are    and   respectively. In this calculus, we have not
considered that a portion of the light, although to a lesser extent,
could also come from a region deeper inside the sample. Notice that
this experimental setup collects the light coming from the whole pumped
volume (∼15 μm in depth, see Supporting Information). We note that leO is
much lower than the microscopic absorption length of the scattering
medium near the sample’s surface (lIn0) (residual “absorption” without R6G) determined in
our previous work (lIn0 ≈ 2700
μm ≫ leO ≈ 110 μm).5 Therefore, the photons would leave the scattering
medium long before being absorbed by it.

without gain (R6G).

The RL emission peak
(Figure 1c) shows a
redshift that increases rapidly for fluencies
from 0.084 up to 8.4 mJ cm–2. For fluencies between
8.4 and 24 mJ cm–2, the redshift is approximately
constant, which coincides with the starting decrease of RLeff (Figure 1a) and FAP
or RL absorbance (RLAbs) (Figure 1b). The redshift starts to decrease for fluencies
≥36 mJ cm–2, for which the RLeff and RLAbs reach the minimum value. The maximum redshift
value (∼7.6 nm) is large, especially considering that the absorption
and emission are both saturated, when compared with the customary
maximum redshift for a TiO2 NP system, which is around
3–4 nm. For comparison, the TiO2@Silica system at
low [NPs] (diffusive regime) showed a maximum redshift of less than
1 nm.15,17 The redshift was previously explained by
a model considering absorption and emission at the transition between
the ground state and the first excited singlet state of the dye molecule:43

The observed saturated absorption (Figure 1b) can be explained
in the following way:
a very low percentage of R6G molecules are in the lowest sublevels,
S0i, of the ground state, and/or a high population of molecules
are in the sublevels, S1i, of the excited singlet state.
Saturated emission (Figure 1a) means a low population of molecules are in the lowest sublevels,
S1i, of the excited singlet state or/and a high population
are in the S0i sublevels of the ground state. Joining saturated
absorption and saturated emission, the result is that a large percentage
of R6G molecules are encountered in the higher lying sublevels of
S1 and S0. Therefore, the transition rates from
S0i up to S1i (absorption) and from S1i to S0i (stimulated emission) are higher than the vibrational
relaxation rate within the excited singlet sublevels, S1i, or within the sublevels of the ground state, S0i (see Supporting Information). The polarization of
R6G molecules by pumping photons trapped within the closed loop paths
(localized state) should give rise to a photon–molecule bound
state,44,45 which in turn would lead to the suppression
of vibrational relaxation and spontaneous emission.46

RL Action in a Small Micrometric Volume
When collecting
the light from the front side of the sample coming from a large surface
area as in Chapter 3, the emission of localized modes is integrated,
making its individual detection difficult. Therefore, to better analyze
the possible peaks, a study has been performed collecting RL emissions
from a micrometric region (∼3.8 μm diameter) near the
input-pumping surface (less than 4 μm depth) using a detection
system that performs like a confocal microscope. For the experimental
setup, see Figure S1b. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the
emission spectra for pumping fluencies below 0.8 mJ cm–2, close to 1.2 mJ cm–2, and above the RL threshold,
3.2 and 6 mJ cm–2. The spectral region framed with
a dashed circle highlights the emerging peaks. For lower pumping fluencies
(0.8 mJ cm–2), the spectra consisted of the fluorescence
emission band with overlapping narrow peaks at frequencies close to
the maximum of the spectrum. As the pump fluence increases, the emission
band becomes narrower, although the overlapped narrow peaks continue
to appear in approximately the same frequency interval of 15–20
nm. The minimum linewidth observed for the narrowest peaks was ≤0.17
nm, which is the spectral resolution limit of our detection system.
The position of these sharp peaks changes little in a few seconds;
it only changes completely after tens of seconds or by stirring the
sample. Notice that the pump spot is 3 mm in diameter, and the estimated
pump depth above the RL threshold must be around 15 μm (Supporting Information). Therefore, the effects
caused by inhomogeneous pumping should not play a role in promoting
these peaks. In addition, the narrow peaks could not result from amplified
spontaneous emission,38 as these emission
spectra are obtained by integrating 21 laser shots of long duration
(∼4 ns). We must highlight that the intensity of these narrow
peaks, relative to the fluorescence band, is lower than that reported
by Cao and co-workers;27 however, similar
peaks have been observed by Gagné and Kashyap36 and Cao and co-workers in a subsequent work.31 An expanded discussion about these peaks, its
intensity, and density can be found in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Emission spectra of RL collected from a small micrometric
volume
(<4 μm diameter and depth) for pumping fluencies of (a) 0.8,
(b) 1.2, (c) 3.2, and (d) 6 mJ cm–2. The diameter
of the pumping spot is the same (3 mm). The solid red lines represent
the respective noise signal. The dashed red circles highlight peaks
emerging in the RL emission spectrum. Emission spectra were collected
integrating 21 laser shots. (e) FAP from the micrometric volume (FAP(μm)), as a function of the pumping energy fluence. FAP(μm) ≈ 1 for pumping fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2.

The FAP values from the
small micrometric volume (FAP(μm)) were measured
with the same experimental setup (Figure S1b). Figure 2e shows
the FAP(μm) dependence with the pumping
fluence. The FAP(μm) values for fluencies (<0.036
mJ cm–2) well below the laser threshold (FAPbT(μm)) are constant (∼1.47), which represents
a passive regime. For fluencies between 0.036 and 0.24 mJ cm–2, the FAP(μm) value decreases quickly down to ∼1.24,
where it remains approximately constant up to a fluence of ∼2.4
mJ cm–2. The latter implies that for this range
of fluencies (0.24–2.4 mJ cm–2), a stationary
regime is reached in this micrometric volume near the input-pumping
surface (<4 μm depth). The FAP(μm) value
starts to drop again quickly for fluencies > 8.6 mJ cm–2 and decrease down to ∼1 (null absorbance) for fluencies ≥36
mJ cm–2. This means that absorbance in this micrometric
volume (near the input-pumping surface) becomes practically zero for
fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2. However, the photon
residence time in this micrometric volume (τeO(Micro) ≈ 0.612 ps; eq 2) would yield a homogeneous spectral broadening of ∼1.29 nm,
obtained by using a Fourier transform assuming a Gaussian envelope,
which is broader than the narrowest linewidth observed in the RL peaks
(≤0.17 nm). This fact could be a consequence of an anomalous
nonlinear increase of the refractive index within the closed loop
paths (localized states), which gives rise to a phase shift (for the
pumping photon) that continuously increases by increasing the intensity
(within the closed loop paths), during the residence time of the pumping
photons. This phase accumulated can lead to a resonance breaking,
reducing τeO(Micro). This phase accumulation by such
an anomalous nonlinear effect would be greatly suppressed for emitted
photons above the lasing threshold, as the intensity increase for
each lasing mode would be a consequence of the stimulated emission.
In other words, the phase accumulated within the localized state during
the laser action (emission) by nonlinear effects is corrected continually,
as the intensity increase results from the stimulated emission. Perhaps
for this reason, the coherent laser emission sustained by localization
has been largely recognized in disordered optical media with gain.27,29−31,34 However, the direct
observation of localization in the absence of gain has proved elusive.3,4 In this way, an anomalous nonlinear increase of the refractive index
could be a likely cause, by which pump photons leave the scattering
medium, breaking the interference condition (localization). A similar
nonlinear phenomenon was theoretically addressed by Buttiker and Moskalets
in disordered electronic media,47 who proposed
that when the energy of the localized state changes, the localized
state can emit nonequilibrium electrons and holes propagating away
from the localized state within the edge state, which acts similar
to a waveguide.

RL Mode Study
To determine the contribution
of the
RL modes, the superfluorescence band (extended band mode or ASE),
and the narrow peaks (peaks mode), an additional experiment was designed.
Let us introduce the following conjecture: if the narrow peaks are
derived from localized modes due to the localization phenomenon, then
they should basically be backscattered, that is, their emission should
be detected in the direction opposite to the pump direction. Note
that the emission of localized modes inside the sample is exponentially
attenuated, so that if they are very near the front edge, they will
be detected only in the spectrum obtained from the front surface (frontal
spectrum) because they are too far from the back edge to survive,
as the attenuation is huge.

During the experiment, the RL emission
was also collected from the back of the cuvette (back collection).
The back-collected spectra consisted of a broad emission band (∼50
nm bandwidth) with an overlapped single emission band (dotted trace
in Figure 3c,e), whose
intensity and bandwidth are dependent on the pumping energy (Figure S5). Figure 3a shows the behavior of the RL intensity
as a function of the pumping fluencies for back and frontal collection.
The RL slope efficiency (RLeff) for back collection (RLeff-back) was constant without depletion (magenta line),
whereas the RLeff of frontal collection decreases from
fluencies ≥12 up to 36 mJ cm–2, where it
keeps constant (blue line, fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2).

Figure 3 Influence of the pump fluence on (a) emitted peak intensity for
frontal and back collection, (b) emitted peak intensity of RL back
collection (open triangle) and difference between frontal and back
collection (closed triangle). (c) The emission spectra for a fluence
of 6 mJ cm–2 collected at the back (dots) and front
(line) of the cuvette, and (d) difference between the frontal and
back spectra of (c). (e) The emission spectra for fluence of 6 mJ
cm–2 recorded by back collection (dots) and the
frontal collection in a small micrometric volume (Figure 2d), and (f) difference between
both spectra. (g) and (h) are similar to (a) and (b), respectively,
but are the spectrally integrated emission intensity.

Owing to the RL peaks mode being saturated at fluencies
≥36
mJ cm–2, we may consider that the saturated RLeff of the frontal collection (blue line, Figure 3a) corresponds to the RLeff of the extended band mode (RLeff-B, ASE).
Therefore, we rescaled the experimental points of the back collection,
which is also ASE or the band mode, by a mathematical factor, such
that RLeff-back = RLeff-B. The
RL emission intensity corresponding to the peaks mode (localized modes)
can then be determined from the difference in intensities between
frontal and back collection. Figure 3b shows a comparison of the RL intensity as a function
of the pumping fluence for the peaks mode (frontal-back) and back-collected
mode. The RLeff peaks mode (RLeff-P)
for fluencies <12 mJ cm–2 (green line) was 1.8-fold
higher than the RLeff-back, and RLeff-P ≈ 0 for fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2. Thus,
the contribution of the peaks mode as compared to the band mode decreases
remarkably as the fluence is increased above 36 mJ cm–2. In turn, the redshift also decreases progressively for fluencies
≥36 mJ cm–2 (Figure 1c). Therefore, we associate the large redshift
(∼7.6 nm) observed in the RL emission to the emission of the
peaks mode (localized modes). The RL threshold for the band mode,
determined from extrapolating RLeff-B to zero, is
∼4 mJ cm–2. The latter explains the slow
FAP decrease observed in Figure 1b for fluencies between 0.36 and 4.8 mJ cm–2. Moreover, this implies that the RL threshold of the peaks mode
must be well below that of the band mode. Notice that the RL threshold
from frontal collection (peaks + band) is only 1.2 mJ cm–2.

Figure 3c
shows
the RL emission spectra at 6 mJ cm–2 for both collections,
the frontal spectrum collected over the whole emission volume and
the back spectrum. The bandwidth of the frontal spectrum (8.8 nm)
is larger than that of the back spectrum (4.8 nm). In addition, the
frontal spectra are slightly asymmetrical, showing a widening toward
a longer wavelength. The resulting spectrum from the difference between
both spectra (Figure 3d), which must correspond to the emission spectrum of the peaks mode
collected from the whole emission area (integrated collection), shows
a plateau in intensity of 2–3 nm (for other pumping fluencies,
see Figure S6). This indicates suppression
of the interaction between the peaks modes, which is a signature of
random lasing at localization.11Figure S7 shows a representative picture of this
phenomenon of suppression of the interaction between localized modes.

For fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2, both RLeff-P and the absorbance in the small micrometric volume
near the input-pumping surface (ln(FAP(μm))) are
approximately zero (RLeff-P = 0 and FAP(μm) ≈ 1), corresponding to absorption and emission saturation.
Therefore, it can be inferred that pumping and emission of the peaks
mode occurs mainly in this micrometric volume near the input-pumping
border. However, FAP (integrated collection) decays down to 1.15 for
pumping fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2 (Figure 1c), where it remains approximately
constant. This means that a stationary lasing regime is reached for
a depth >4 μm and for pumping fluencies ≥36 mJ cm–2. From the latter it can be interpreted that, near
the input-pumping surface (<4 μm depth), the absorption–emission
contribution of the nonlocalized modes must be negligible as compared
to that of the peaks mode (localization mode), that is, the nonlocalized
modes should mainly be located deeper in the sample (>4 μm).

The R6G microscopic absorption length (small micrometric volume
near the input-pumping border) above the RL threshold (la*(μm)) is ∼483
μm (see Supporting Information).
Furthermore, the average photon path length, leO, in this micrometric volume near the input-pumping border
(leO(Micro)) is ∼104 μm (eq 1). Therefore, leO(Micro) < la*(μm), which means that above
the RL threshold the pumping photons leave the scattering medium (backscattered)
long before being absorbed by R6G molecules. As a consequence, the
R6G absorption length above the RL threshold, la*(μm), does not represent
an impediment for localizing pumping photons. The latter indicates
that the frequency and wavefunction of a localized lasing mode should
be approximately the same as those of the passive mode of the scattering
medium, which was theoretically predicted by Stano and Jacquod.11

Figure 3e shows
the RL emission spectra at 6 mJ cm–2 for frontal
collection (from a small micrometric volume near the input border)
and back collection. The bandwidth of the frontal spectrum (∼9.6
nm) is larger than the back spectrum (4.8 nm). Figure 3f shows the spectrum resulting from the difference
between both spectra, which corresponds to the emission spectrum of
the peaks mode coming from a small micrometric volume near the input-pumping
border (<4 μm depth). The narrow peaks in Figure 3f are more defined, showing
similar intensities in a large frequency range (∼7–8
nm), presumably due to the lower coupling degree and higher gain of
the peaks mode,11 allowing for the lasing
condition in a large frequency range within the R6G fluorescence bandwidth.
The similarity in intensity of the narrow peaks could be caused by
(i) the stimulated emission rate being higher than the vibrational
relaxation rate, causing the gain of the peaks to be approximately
equal in this frequency range, (ii) suppression of the interaction
between the peaks modes. Notice that, owing to localization, spontaneous
emission and vibrational relaxation must be inhibited (within localized
states),44−46 and the interaction between localized lasing modes
(peaks mode) would be considerably suppressed, even between modes
that have significant spatial or frequency overlap.11,12 The latter can be understood by realizing that the photons confined
in a localized mode must be strongly correlated.11 Therefore, for different localized lasing modes, even with
significant spatial or frequency overlap, the interactions between
modes must be frozen above the RL threshold. Notice that photons from
different localized lasing modes would be strongly uncorrelated (for
a representative picture, see Figure S7). We note that the similarity in intensity observed in the spectrum
of the small micrometric peaks (∼7–8 nm; Figure 3f) is broader than that observed
in the spectrum of the peaks mode extracted through the integrated
collection over the whole emission volume (∼2–3 nm, Figure 3d). This must be
because the acquisition depth for the small micrometric collection
(<4 μm) is shallower than that for the integrated collection
(∼15 μm). In this way, the peaks mode spectrum, collected
by integrating over the whole emission volume, represents modes with
a range of quality factors broader than that from the micrometric
collection (near the input-pumping surface). The quality factor of
a passive mode at localization must decrease with depth, as localization
decreases with depth.5,48,49

Figure 3g shows
the behavior of the spectrally integrated RL emission for the frontal
integrated collection (collected over the whole emission volume) and
back collection (in exact analogy to Figure 3a where we analyzed the peak spectral intensity
instead). Figure 3h
shows a comparison of the spectrally integrated RL emissions for peaks
and band modes. The integrated emission slope (fluencies ≤
8.4 mJ cm–2) of the peaks mode (green line) was
∼2.9 times higher than that for the extended mode band (magenta
line). Therefore, for fluencies ≤8.4 mJ cm–2, ∼74% of the RL emission, detected with our experimental
setup, corresponds to the peaks mode.

A detailed study with
a detection system of more resolution and
sensibility is called for, to more precisely determine the linewidth
of the RL peaks and their relationship with τeO,
as well as the physical origin of τeO. Moreover,
an expanded study varying the pumping and collection angles50 would allow a better understanding of the RL
operation at the localization transition.

Conclusions
Core–shell
TiO2@Silica NPs at [140 × 1010 NPs mL–1] in an ethanol solution of R6G
[1 × 10–4 M] allowed us to study the RL action
at the localization transition. An absorption–emission saturation
phenomenon was observed in the RL. This phenomenon was associated
with the absorption–emission saturation of the localized modes
called the peaks mode. A large redshift of ∼7.6 nm is observed
in the RL emission spectrum, which was associated with the emission
of the peaks mode. The FAP measurement provides an additional approach
to the study of the scattering medium, which allows us to infer that
the localized modes must be confined near the input-pumping border
(FAP(μm)). In addition, FAP(μm) measurement
allowed us to infer that the absorption above the RL threshold does
not suppress localizing pumping photons. The latter indicates that
the frequency and wavefunction of a localized lasing mode should be
approximately the same as those of the passive mode of the scattering
medium. Narrow peaks with a linewidth of ≤0.17 nm were observed
in the RL emission spectrum. This linewidth (0.17 nm) is narrower
than the mean linewidth of the modes of the scattering medium (∼1.29
nm, τeO(Micro) ≈ 0.612 ps). This fact could
be a consequence of the anomalous nonlinear increase of the refractive
index by localization, due to the continuously increasing intensity
within the closed loop paths during the residence time of the pumping
photons. This effect would be greatly suppressed for emitted photons
above the lasing threshold, as the intensity increase would be a result
of stimulated emission. The back-collection method allowed for the
separate measurement of the RL band mode, showing a linear dependence
with pumping fluence without gain depletion. The emission spectrum
of the peaks mode was extracted by subtracting the frontal and back
spectra, showing narrow peaks with similar intensity in a broad frequency
range. The latter suggests suppression of interaction between the
peaks modes, which is a signature of random lasing at localization.
Finally, the contribution of RL peaks and band modes was determined.

Materials
and Methods
The pumping source of the RL was the second harmonic
of a Q-switched
Nd:YAG laser system with a pulse width of ∼4 ns, a repetition
rate up to 15 Hz, and a spot size of 3 mm. The emission spectra were
collected through a multimode optical fiber (50 or 200 μm),
coupled to a spectrometer HR4000 UV–VIS (Ocean Optics), with
a 0.17 nm spectral resolution (FWHM). The pumping energy fluence per
pulse is varied between 0.003 and 72 mJ cm–2. The
schematic diagrams of the experimental setup for RL studies are shown
in Figures S1a,b and S5a. To study in depth
the emission spectrum (emerging peaks), RL emission coming from a
micrometric region near the input-pumping surface was collected through
an appropriate optical system (Figure S1b), using the same pumping spot (3 mm diameter). The emission spectra
were acquired by integrating 21 laser shots (1.4 s at 15 Hz). R6G
at [1 × 10–4 M] was added to the ethanol solution
containing TiO2@Silica NPs at [140 × 1010 NPs mL–1]. The transport mean free path (lT) for this [NPs] was determined through the
measurement of the transmitted coherent intensity (lT0 = 1.3 μm).5
