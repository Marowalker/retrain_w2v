Glaucoma is a very serious disease that can lead to blindness
in
severe cases. In an attempt to increase the efficacy of the drugs
used in treating this disease, many particulate systems (micro/nano
and lipid-based/nonlipid-based) have been exploited. In this study,
the meta-analysis approach was implemented in order to explore the
published studies and extract the literature-based evidence (proof-of-concept
studies = 16) that the particulate systems increase the efficiency
of the investigated intraocular pressure drugs as demonstrated by
the increase in the area under effect curve. Comparison of micron
particles versus nanoparticles on the one hand and lipid-based versus
nonlipid-based on the other hand, as subgroups of the meta-analysis,
was also included in the study where the latter comparison led to
insignificant differences, whereas the former has proven the superiority
of the nanoparticles over the micronized counterparts.

1 Introduction
Glaucoma is a pathological
eye condition that is usually associated
with an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and it is the second
cause of blindness worldwide that it is currently named as the silent
blinder.1 Several attempts have been made
in order to deliver antiglaucomatous drugs and increase their residence
and contact with the cornea and to augment their penetration abilities.
Among these attempts are the usage of particulate systems which include
the lipid-based particles such as the liposomal vesicles,2,3 solid lipid nanoparticles,4 and nanostructured
lipid carriers5 on one hand and the utilization
of other nonlipid particles such as the polymeric,6 protein-based particles like gelatin-based particles7 and surfactant-based counterparts such as the
niosomes8 on the other hand. These carriers were highly variable according to their size, encountering
both micron- and nanosized particles throughout the investigated research
articles.

Meta-analysis is an advanced statistical technique
that combines
data emerging from multiple studies on a particular topic. It increases
the accuracy and precision of the study estimates. Actually, meta-analyses
play fundamental roles in evidence-based healthcare-related topics.
Compared to other study designs (such as randomized controlled trials
or cohort studies), meta-analysis comes in at the top of the “levels
of evidence” pyramid.9

Currently,
the use of meta-analysis is gaining more grounds and
is considered crucial in both clinical and industrial decision-making,10 though not fully explored in the drug delivery
discipline. Additionally, with the advent of the Internet and computer
softwares, the exploitation of literature and data is becoming easier
and the mining of this treasure is becoming more warranted.11−13 Meta-analysis, the quantitative synthesis of information from independent
sources (studies), forms a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine.14 It is indeed a powerful tool that can be used
to compare any intervention with a control.10

The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative summary
of
the existing literature which utilized the particulate systems approach
for the enhancement of the pharmacodynamics of glaucoma treatments
represented by the area under effect (intraocular pressure, IOP) curve
(AUEC), which is additionally considered an indirect marker of the
bioavailability of the delivered drugs. The significance of this approach
was assessed. Furthermore, two covariates were evaluated, namely,
the type of material used (whether lipid-based or not) and the size
of the particulate system (whether micronized or nanosized). Such
information could be very helpful and insightful for the drug delivery
and formulation scientists who wish to adopt this kind of approach
to increase the efficacy of glaucoma therapy.

2 Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the
summary of the performed meta-analysis study after calculating the
standardized mean difference (SMD) for each study and the lower and
upper confidence intervals (CIs). All the investigated studies were
proven significant with CIs always lying on one side of the zero as
a cutoff (i.e., either both positive or both negative) as demonstrated
by the generated forest plot from the used software (Figure 1). Usually, an individual study
is considered significant if its SMD with its two CIs are all positive
or all negative without crossing or passing the zero cutoff (i.e.,
in the current analysis, the particulate treatment significantly increases
the AUEC or significantly decreases it as compared to the control,
the drug solution).10

The overall meta-analysis study was extremely significant
with
a P value < 0.001 with a pooled estimate of 7.987
and CI (5.334, 10.639), confirming the significance of the results
and the presence of the real effect of the use of the particulate
systems on the pharmacodynamic responses of the investigated drugs,
as revealed by AUEC.

The particulate systems are usually successfully
uptaken by the
cells present in the different biological membranes such as the cornea
that normally consists of stratified squamous epithelium (the hardest-to-penetrate)
using different mechanisms such as passive diffusion, clathrate–claveolate-mediated
endocytosis, and micropinocytosis.15−18

In another encounter, the
heterogeneity of meta-analysis was high,
with the degree of heterogeneity (I2)
scoring 91%. The source of heterogeneity comes from the different
years of study, different animals, different kinds of measurements,
different climates, and different number of animals.19

Additionally, a leave-one-out meta-analysis was carried
out to
exclude the study of the highest weight (Table 2) Wang et al. 2014. The pooled estimate changed
to 7.940 (5.670, 10.210), and the heterogeneity dropped to 85% (Figure 2).

Further exploring, the investigated studies were subdivided
into
two groups according to the main material used to fabricate the particulate
system: subgroup 1––lipid-based encoded (1) and subgroup
2––nonlipid-based encoded (2). Subgroup meta-analysis
was implemented, where subgroup 1 scored a pooled estimate of 8.266
with CIs (5.209, 11.322), whereas subgroup 2 scored a pooled estimate
of 9.166 with CIs (4.927, 13.405). The overlapping CIs indicate nonsignificant
differences between the two subgroups. Surprisingly, the lipid-based
particulate systems were not superior to the nonlipid counterparts.
Though lipids such as the phospholipids or triglycerides are compatible
with the endothelial corneal layers, the surfactant-based particles
are still compatible as usually nonionic surfactants are the ones
used for ocular delivery. Additionally, even the polymeric
and protein-based particles are still highly compatible with other
corneal layers such as the stroma.35,36

Moreover,
the investigated studies were subdivided into two other
subgroups according to the size range of the used particulate system:
subgroup 1––nanosized particles encoded (1) and subgroup
2––micron-sized particles encoded (2). The subgroup
meta-analysis was reimplemented changing the covariate. Subgroup 1
was proven significantly superior in increasing the AUEC as compared
to the control, scoring a pooled estimate of 13.649 with CIs (8.462,
18.837), whereas subgroup 2 scored 5.906 with CIs (6.007, 10.712).
The results are significant as the CIs do not overlap.

Although
one may think that the micronized particles may reside
in the cul-du-sac and in more contact with the cornea because of their
larger particle size preventing their easy drainage, it seems that
the higher penetration ability of the nanoparticles supersedes this
property and enables the drugs to surpass the corneal barrier more
efficiently.35

3 Conclusions
There is a strong literature-driven
evidence based on meta-analysis
that the particulate systems (micro/nano) potentiate the pharmacodynamic
effects of antiglaucomatous drugs on animals. Furthermore, the study
gives evidence that the nanoparticles are more efficient in lowering
the IOP than the micronized counterparts and hence pose more efficient
glaucoma therapies. The material with which the nanosystem is produced
does not appear to influence its eye performance.

4 Methodology
4.1 Data Mining
A computer-based search
was conducted on databases such as Medlineand Embase and on a search
engine, Google Scholar. SciFinder was also used to reconduct a further
computer-based research for any relevant patents or commentaries.

The following keywords were utilized in the search: micro, nano,
vesicles, lipid, polymer, polymeric, nanoparticles, glaucoma, ocular,
and liposomes. All the searches were performed in English language.

4.2 Inclusion Data and their Criteria
The mined articles were considered eligible for evaluation if they
contained the methodology and discussion related to particulate systems
that are used as carriers for drugs to lower the IOP on animal studies
through the topical ocular route. All initially eligible articles
were further screened in detail by analyzing the abstract and full
text. All the articles should contain original data (research articles).
AUC or AUEC (starting from the baseline) should have been reported
or can be calculated from IOP tables. The optimization or the formulation
scoring the highest AUEC was selected in case of the studies containing
several formulations.

The following data were collected from
articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria: the name of the author
and year of publication, the studied drug, type of the carrier (lipid-based
or nonlipid-based: surfactants or polymers), particle size (micron
or nano), and AUEC as a pharmacodynamic parameter compared to a control
(drug solution).

4.3 Meta-Analysis
The meta-analysis was
performed to confirm the augmentation of the pharmacodynamic effects
of the antiglaucomatous drugs compared to the drug solution as a control,
as revealed by AUEC, and this was considered the basis of the effect
size of the experiment. As meta-analysis combines the results of different
studies and gives an overall conclusion, “heterogeneity”
should be considered.

The effect size (AUEC) and the study sample
size were fed into OpenMetaAnalyst (http://www.cebm.brown.edu/openMeta/) to perform meta-analysis of the investigated studies and provide
forest plots.

As the studies in this meta-analysis are variable
in their animal
numbers (sample size), they do not meet the underlying assumption
of a fixed effect model that only the sampling error is the source
of variability; hence, the overall effect size was estimated using
the random effects model and utilizing the Der Simonian–Laird
method. The random effects model takes into account the variability
between studies such as measurements and sample size and was therefore
claimed adequate for the purpose of this meta-analysis. Heterogeneity
was assessed using two parameters: the Q statistic
and the I2 index. The Q statistic gives an indication of the presence or absence of heterogeneity
among a set of studies related to differences in the measurements,
year of study, and conditions, whereas the I2 index gives an indication of the degree of heterogeneity.
The mean percent increase and a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated
and represented in the forest plot. Significance was employed by the P value. The sensitivity and consistency of the study were
evaluated using the leave-one-out meta-analysis.

The effect
size was calculated as follows 1  where N is the sample size
(number of animals).

SMD was calculated as 2  where 3  where na is the
number of animals that received the particulate formulation, nb is the number of animals that received the
drug solution as a control, Sa is the
standard deviation of the particulate formulation mean effect, whereas Sb is the standard deviation of the drug solution
mean effect.

Every study weight was calculated as follows 4  where SE is the standard error of each study.

Q is the amount of observed heterogeneity that
will be compared to the amount of expected heterogeneity by chance,
whereas I2 index is the quantitative degree
of heterogeneity and is calculated as: , where df is the degree of freedom taken
as the number of studies – 1.

Furthermore, the mined
studies were divided into subgroups according
to the following:(a) Particle type designed as covariate
factors encoded (1) and (2) for lipid-based and nonlipid-based, respectively.

(b) Particle size also designed
as other
covariate factors encoded (1) and (2) for the nano- and micron-sized
particles, respectively.
