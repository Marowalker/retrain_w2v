Over
80 heat treatment experiments have been made on samples of
chloride-contaminated plutonium dioxide retrieved from two packages
in storage at Sellafield. These packages dated from 1974 and 1980
and were produced in a batch process by conversion of plutonium oxalate
in a furnace at around 550 °C. The storage package contained
a poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) bag between the screw top inner and outer
metal cans. Degradation of the PVC has led to adsorption of hydrogen
chloride together with other atmospheric gases onto the PuO2 surface. Analysis by caustic leaching and ion chromatography gave
chloride contents of ∼2000 to >5000 ppm Cl (i.e., μgCl
g–1 of the original sample). Although there are
some subtle differences, in general, there is surprisingly good agreement
in results from heat treatment experiments for all the samples from
both cans. Mass loss on heating (LOH) plateaus at nearly 3 wt % above
700 °C, although samples that were long stored under an air atmosphere
or preexposed to 95% relative humidity atmospheres, gave higher LOH
up to ∼4 wt %. The majority of the mass loss is due to adsorbed
water and other atmospheric gases rather than chloride. Heating volatilizes
chloride only above ∼400 °C implying that simple physisorption
of HCl is not the main cause of contamination. Interestingly, above
700 °C, >100% of the initial leachable chloride can be volatilized.
Surface (leachable) chloride decreases quickly with heat treatment
temperatures up to ∼600 °C but only slowly above this
temperature. Storage in air atmosphere post-heat treatment apparently
leads to a reequilibration as leachable chloride increases. The presence
of a “nonleachable” form of chloride was thus inferred
and subsequently confirmed in PuO2 samples (pre- and post-heat
treatment) that were fully dissolved and analyzed for the total chloride
inventory. Reheating samples in either air or argon at temperatures
up to the first heat treatment temperature did not volatilize significant
amounts of additional chloride. With regard to a thermal stabilization
process, heat treatment in flowing air at 800 °C with cooling
and packaging under dry argon appears optimal, particularly, if thinner
powder beds can be maintained. From electron microscopy, heat treatment
appeared to have the most effect on degrading the square platelet
particles compared to those with the trapezoidal morphology.

1 Introduction
Civil plutonium dioxide (PuO2), accumulated from over
50 years of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing in the U.K., is safely
and securely stored at the Sellafield site prior to Government decisions
on its disposition.1−5 A small percentage of this stockpile contains elevated levels of
chlorine from the decomposition of the poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)
liners that cover the inner metal can. This has released hydrogen
chloride (HCl) gas that has adsorbed onto the PuO2 powder
surface. These materials originate from reprocessing of Magnox fuel
at Sellafield mainly before 1975 and were packaged in nested, nonwelded
metal containers. Thus, chloride from PVC degradation during storage,
relatively high levels of moisture and other atmospheric gases have
been adsorbed by the hygroscopic PuO2. For long-term interim
safe storage, these materials must be retrieved and repackaged into
welded cans in new facilities, but high chloride and moisture contents
mean that a thermal treatment process is required to stabilize the
PuO2 before repackaging.6−8 Previously, we have reported
studies of the adsorption of HCl(g) onto cerium dioxide,9 often used as a nonradioactive analogue for PuO2,10−14 and onto PuO2 powders that were artificially contaminated
with HCl(g) in the laboratory.15 In the
latter work, two forms of surface chloride were proposed, and there
was some evidence for a nonleachable chloride species that remained
on the solid after heat treatment. While these studies effectively
developed the methods to be used, concerns were raised as to whether
these laboratory materials would be representative of the “real
world” aged PuO2 powders retrieved from Sellafield
stores. Some initial results of heat treatments and powder characterization
of samples of actual high chloride PuO2 powder from the
stores were reported in ref (16). In that work, it was shown that chloride was desorbed
from the PuO2 powders at temperatures above 700 °C,
and a conversion of nonleachable species to volatile chloride was
indicated indirectly by mass balances of chloride, as measured from
trapping volatile species and from leaching the powders before and
after heat treatment, significantly exceeding 100%. Furthermore, XRD
analyses (lattice parameters) showed an annealing of the structure
with heat treatment. In experiments in a sealed pressurizable vessel,
water adsorption on chloride-contaminated PuO2 was shown
to be different to standard PuO2 powders,16,17 indicating a coadsorption of water with chloride on the PuO2 surface. Substantial quantities of various gases (including
He, H2, NO, and CO) were desorbed from the chloride-contaminated
PuO2 samples even at quite low temperatures of 100–230
°C. This paper describes a much wider range of heat treatment
experiments aimed at underpinning the design of the thermal stabilization
process that will be implemented at Sellafield to deal with these
problematic legacy nuclear materials making them suitable for long-term
storage in welded, nested metal containers.5−7

2 Materials and Methods
The experimental methods have been
described in detail previously9,15,16 and so are only summarized in
this section.

2.1 Equipment
Vertical furnaces with
top guards to protect against hot surfaces were installed in air atmosphere
and inert (nitrogen or argon) atmosphere glove boxes. PuO2 was contained in a quartz tube, and a pump was used to flow gas
over the sample while in the furnace (either air or inert gas depending
on the glove box atmosphere). Downstream, the off gas passed through
an antisuck back trap and then a caustic trap was used to capture
the volatile chloride component and also to prevent corrosive gases
entering the glove box.

Note that all plutonium experiments
were performed in negative pressure radiochemical glove boxes in facilities
licensed for working with α-active nuclear materials and in
strict compliance with authorized procedures.

2.2 Materials
PuO2 samples
were supplied by plant operators (Sellafield Ltd.) in ∼20 g
aliquots contained in screw top aluminum cans after sampling from
two separate cans of legacy high chloride PuO2 in an inert
atmosphere plutonium glove box. The two cans sampled dated from 1974
(herein, labeled “can 1”) and 1980 (“can 2”)
and were produced on the same finishing line, using the oxalate precipitation
route. The original calcination of plutonium(IV) oxalate was done
at ∼550 °C in air in a batch furnace. The respective physical
properties for the two can samples are listed in Table 1 (data provided by Sellafield
Ltd. Analytical Services (SLAS) using quality assured analytical methods
(QAAM)). On receipt, all PuO2 samples were stored in the
aluminum cans in an air atmosphere glove box and used by the National
Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) in the “as-received” condition
without any pretreatment unless otherwise stated. From Table 1, it is seen that the percentage
loss on heating (LOH) is high, and the plutonium assay is low. This
is due to adsorption of atmospheric gases during storage in “breathable”
packages and in-growth of 241Am from 241Pu.
Note also that the specific surface area (SSA) is significantly lower
than expected from calcination of plutonium(IV) oxalate at 550 °C
(15.8 m2 g–1).18

2.3 Heat Treatment Experiments
Separate
samples of 0.5–10 g of chloride-contaminated PuO2 powders were taken from an aliquot contained in the aluminum can
for each experiment—note that ∼1 g of sample equals
∼3 mm bed depth in the furnace tube. Approximately 50 milligrams
was subsampled, accurately weighed, and used for analysis of the starting
material. The remainder was accurately weighed and then heated in
the furnace. Gas flow rates of 100–250 mL min–1 were used, and unless otherwise stated, the experiments were performed
in an air atmosphere. The furnace was held at the set temperature
for a few hours followed by cooling overnight. Acidic off gases were
captured in the caustic trap (0.1–0.5 mol L–1 NaOH). A few experiments used a second caustic trap. The PuO2 residue was removed and reweighed with subsamples taken for
analysis (20–50 mg). Most heat treatment experiments were performed
under “standard” conditions of 2 h hold at the set temperature
and 250 mL min–1 air flow with the air flow maintained
for the first hour of cooling. Some samples were reanalyzed and/or
subjected to additional heat treatments after periods of interim glove
box storage.

Additional series of heat treatment experiments
were run to investigate other features or broaden the parameter space
covered; these were (a) variable hold times at the set temperature,
(b) prehumidified samples, and (c) a single sample that was “sequentially”
heated to 300, 600, 800, and 900 °C on consecutive days (that
is, following heating in the furnace, the sample was allowed to cool
overnight to ambient temperature, the powder was sampled, and the
caustic trap was sampled and changed before heating to the next temperature
in the series on the following day).

Full lists of samples and
experimental conditions are given in
the Supporting Information (Sample Data section). Note that samples are listed according to the can and
aliquot from which they were taken. Thus, for example, “2.2”
indicates a sample taken from can 2 aliquot 2. Aliquots 3, 4, and
5 from can 2 were mixed and blended to provide a single homogenized
sample labeled “2.345”.

2.4 Chloride
Analysis
PuO2 samples taken for chloride analysis
were leached for a minimum of
8 h in dilute caustic solution (0.1–0.5 mol L–1 NaOH), filtered, and analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) with a
Dionex ion chromatography system incorporating an ED50 electrochemical
detector in a conductivity mode with a Dionex ASRS 300 4 mm self-regenerating
suppressor, a GP50 gradient pump, a column thermostat oven, and an
AS40 autosampler with a pneumatic injection port. Chloride was separated
from other anions on an IonPac AS14A anionic exchange column (4 ×
250 mm) with a corresponding guard column (IonPac AG14A 4 × 50
mm) using a mobile phase composition of 8 × 10–3 mol L–1 sodium carbonate and 1.0 × 10–3 mol L–1 sodium bicarbonate in ultrahigh
quality (UHQ) 18 MΩ cm–1 deionized water.
All samples were diluted in UHQ water with dilution factors ranging
from 2 to 40 prior to introduction onto the IC system. Variation in
repeat DIONEX analyses was low and is not considered to be a significant
source of error; for example, three repeat analyses on the same sample
gave 3800, 3750, and 3770 ppm (three significant figures).15,16

2.5 Total Dissolution
A method has been
developed to fully dissolve PuO2 powders while oxidizing
chloride present to chlorine gas that is then captured in caustic
traps on the off-gas flows. The traps are analyzed by DIONEX ion chromatographic
analysis, as described above, except that 1.7 × 10–3 mol L–1 H2O2 is present
to oxidize any hypochlorite formed from chlorine dissolution (see eq 2 in the Discussion section below). The method used here adopts the
well-established Ce(IV)-mediated electrochemical dissolution process
in nitric acid.19 PuO2 powders
are dissolved in a small electrochemical H-cell with anolyte and catholyte
compartments separated by an N1110 ion selective membrane. Samples
are dissolved in 3 mol L–1 HNO3 containing
0.1 mol L–1 cerium(III) nitrate at ∼100 °C.
The anode is a platinum mesh, and the cathode is a titanium plate,
both welded onto titanium rods. The anode compartment is stirred and
heated with a condenser fitted to minimize distillation of the anolyte
during heating. Off gases are trapped in caustic scrubbers. The whole
system is run under reduced pressure to minimize any losses.

2.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Samples were prepared
by immobilizing a small quantity of the powder
(<0.5 mg) on an SEM stub using a carbon sticky tab. The resulting
stubs were then coated with a thin layer of carbon using an Emitech
K250R carbon coater and placed in a Phenom Pro X scanning electron
microscope with a back scatter electron detector. All imaging was
performed using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Loss on Heating (LOH)
The mass loss
on heating (LOH) from 100 to 950 °C is illustrated in Figure 1. There is a near
linear increase in LOH up to ∼700 °C and then a slower
increase reaching ∼2.8 wt % LOH at 950 °C, although there
was some variability—one anomalous can 2 sample gave 3.7 wt
% LOH at 800 °C (see Figure S1, Supporting
Information). There was an apparent small increase in LOH with dwell
time at the peak furnace temperature. While LOH in small samples (0.5–1
g) is constant by 4 h dwell time, larger samples (2.5–3 cm
bed depth) were slower to reach a constant value, and both can 1 and
can 2 samples tended to show a slightly lower LOH (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Overall, the data indicate
that temperatures above 700 °C, held for 2–4 h, would
be suitable for “drying” the powders, removing the bulk
of the adsorbed water and other atmospheric gases to levels acceptable
for long-term storage. More interestingly, additional moisture and
atmospheric gases are adsorbed by these high chloride powders when
kept for long periods at ambient temperatures in an air atmosphere
glove box or when exposed to high relative humidity (RH) atmospheres
(Table 2).

samples taken from the same aliquot (if multiple runs at the same
temperature were made), and error bars represent the standard deviations
calculated from multiple runs. (Except for “reheat”
experiments where individual experiment numbers are given in the legend).

3.2 Initial Leachable Chloride Concentration
The initial leachable chloride contents for each aliquot of the
powder sampled from both cans are given in Table 3. It is seen that there was quite a wide
variation in can 1 from <2000 to >5000 ppm Cl (i.e., μgCl
g–1 of the original sample, denoted as OS) measured,
whereas the range is less for can 2 (from ∼4600 to ∼5400
ppm Cl). All measurements used ambient temperature caustic leaching
to recover chloride from PuO2 except for aliquot 1.6, where
a more aggressive pyrohydrolysis method was used (steam flowed over
PuO2 at 960 °C to remove chloride prior to analysis
by an ion selective electrode (ISE)20,21); curiously,
the chloride content in this case was the lowest of all the aliquots
measured, but note that no further experiments were performed on this
aliquot to confirm the low value. The variations in the initial leachable
chloride between samples taken from the same aliquot are generally
rather low (<10% RSD, see Table 3) indicating that powders are quite well homogenized
within any taken aliquot, but the significant differences between
aliquots is probably linked to the location of sampling of the powder
within the can and the local conditions that the can experienced over
several decades of storage. This implies a heterogeneous distribution
of chloride through the material, which is not surprising given that
HCl must diffuse into the powder from the outside, and there is also
a temperature gradient across the powder from ∼80 (can wall)
to ∼200 °C (center line) due to radiogenic self-heating.

The effects on the leachable chloride content of as-received samples,
when stored in either the air atmosphere glove box or under humid
atmospheres (50 and 95% RH), remain inconclusive. All samples adsorbed
atmospheric gases and/or moisture (as determined by either mass gain
or LOH analysis at 700–950 °C). In a few cases, the leachable
chloride concentrations increased significantly (experiments 64 and
65 from aliquot 2.2 increased to ∼5500 ppm Cl compared to experiments
40 and 41 that were ∼4300, and four samples of aliquot 1.2
stored under 95% RH increased to ∼4800 ppm Cl), but there was
no discernible trend as other samples exposed to 95% RH (experiments
42 and 43) and stored in the glovebox (experiment 54) did not show
such increases in the initial leachable chloride concentrations.

3.3 Heat Treatment Experiments in Air
As previously
described,15,16 the chloride results
from the heat treatment experiments are presented as1. concentrations of
chloride (in ppm,
i.e., μgCl gOS–1, where OS denotes original
sample mass), and

2. normalized
to the initial (leachable)
chloride present on PuO2 and expressed as a percentage.



Note that all the data points in the graphs
of chloride
concentration versus temperature represent individual experiments
with separate samples taken from the chlorinated PuO2 powders
as listed in the Sample Data section of
the Supporting Information.

3.4 Volatile Chloride
The data for chloride
captured in the caustic traps after heat treatments in air are illustrated
in Figure 2a,b and Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Certain features
are apparent:At furnace temperatures
below 300–400 °C,
almost no chloride is evolved. Initial data were supported by a few
additional experiments at 300 and 400 °C where samples were initially
heated in air and then reheated under argon (experiments 58–63)
(see Table 4).

As reported previously,16 at temperatures above 700 °C, greater than 100% of
the initial
leachable chloride is recovered from analysis of the caustic trap
and leaching from the residual powder in some cases; this is particularly
noticeable for can 2 samples (0.5–1 g mass).

Trends are similar for can 1 and can 2 samples (0.5–1
g mass), but (most) can 2 samples volatilized greater amounts of chloride
at temperatures ≥400 °C than can 1 samples.

Increased sample masses tended to volatilize lower amounts
of chloride. A notable exception to this is the sequential heat treatment,
which was a 10 g can 1 sample that behaved similarly to the 0.5–1
g can 1 samples.

Two small samples (experiments
64–65, ∼0.5
g) from can 2 gave lower volatile chloride values (4340 and 2430 ppm
at 700 and 800 °C) than the other small can 2 samples. However,
these experiments were run at a later date after a longer length of
storage in the air atmosphere glove box (they were also from a different
aliquot).

Samples that had been exposed
to 95% RH gave lower volatile
chloride.

measured in the caustic
trap) as (a) ppm Cl (i.e., μgCl gOS–1) where
the line represents a polynomial fit to the “can 2 (∼0.5–1
g)” data excluding samples 64 and 65 (see text) and (b) a percentage
of initial leachable chloride–averaged data where error bars
represent the standard deviations on multiple runs at the same temperature
and where the line represents a polynomial fit to the “can
2 (∼0.5–1 g)” data. Polynomial fits are included
to aid visualization of trends only. All experiments heated in air
with a 2 h hold time at the peak (set) temperature with cover air
flow at 250 mL min–1 maintained for an initial period
of cooling (for sample data, see the Supporting Information).

Experiments at 300 and 400 °Ca

a Samples were initially
heated under
air and then reheated under argon atmospheres (for further sample
details, see the Supporting Information).

It is concluded from
these data that chloride is not simply physisorbed
to the surface and significant activation energy is required to volatilize
the chloride. Previously,16 we hypothesized
that a nonleachable form of chloride is present initially, and this
is volatilized at high temperatures (≥700 °C), possibly
linked to thermal annealing of the radiation damaged lattice (see
powder XRD data in refs (15) and (16)). Volatilization in freshly retrieved samples follows similar behaviors,
although
can to can fluctuations are likely. Mass transfer effects in deeper
bed depths are apparent, causing a lower efficiency of chloride desorption,
perhaps either because chloride can readsorb when moving through deeper
powder beds and/or the air flow over the powder bed is less effective;
this is probably sensitive to conditions as experiment 31 did not
really show a reduced volatilization. Also, later experiments at variable
residence times in the furnace (Figure 3) showed smaller differences in volatile chloride between
∼1 and ∼8 g samples. Interestingly, volatilization appeared
to be suppressed in samples that were stored in the air atmosphere
glove box or under high relative humidity. This contrasts with the
10 g sequential heat treatment experiment in which higher volatilization
overall was obtained in line with the small-scale (0.5–1 g
mass) experiments. These data taken together suggest that “drier”
samples desorb chloride more readily and that samples with higher
water contents retain chloride species more stubbornly.

Figure 3 Leachable (closed
symbols) and volatile (open symbols) chloride
concentrations (ppm) post-heat treatment at 800 °C and variable
hold times for experimental runs with thick and thin powder bed depths
(experiments 66–72, aliquot 2.345; for sample identification,
see the Supporting Information).

Thus, it is seen that thermal
processing of chloride-contaminated
PuO2 will be effective at volatilizing chloride above 700
°C in air atmospheres, with higher temperatures driving off greater
amounts of nonleachable chloride into the off-gas stream. Temperatures
up to 800 °C would be a suitable compromise between chloride
desorption, drying (yielding low LOH) and avoiding undesirable degrees
of surface area reduction.18 Thinner powder
beds with a faster cover gas flow are preferred to enhance desorption.
Nevertheless, there is likely to be some variation in efficiency at
desorbing chlorine due to sensitivities to plant conditions as well
as chloride speciation. Off-gas systems will need to be resistant
to corrosion in the presence of HCl(g) and water vapor.

3.5 Residual Chloride on PuO2
The residual leachable
chloride concentrations on the powders after
heat treatment are illustrated in Figure 4. Features of the data are the following:The variations in initial leachable
chloride concentrations
from the different aliquots are obvious (also see Table 3).

Despite taking data from two different cans, across
several aliquots with differing initial chloride concentrations and
sample masses, the residual chloride concentrations across the temperature
range of 100–950 °C show a remarkable similarity in the
observed trends—remembering that these are real world materials
produced on a plant scale in the 1970–1980s and retrieved from
stores, not model samples produced and stored under controlled, reproducible
conditions in the laboratory.

There is
a rapid drop in leachable chloride up to ∼600
°C, and then, the decrease with temperature is more gradual.
Again, temperatures up to ∼800 °C are probably optimal
for reducing the leachable chloride concentrations in heat-treated
powders to low levels.

Small-scale samples
from can 1 reach a fairly constant
level of ∼500 ppm Cl, whereas can 2 samples decrease close
to zero leachable chloride at ≥800 °C.

Larger samples tend to retain greater amounts of leachable
chloride compared to the small-scale samples, again indicative of
enhanced desorption in thinner powder beds (see also Figure 3).

Increasing residence time decreases the leachable chloride
concentration, reaching a steady state at ∼4 h for the small-scale
samples, but the leachable chloride in the larger samples (∼8
g) is still slowly decreasing even at 8 h residence time (Figure 3).



Figure 4 Residual leachable chloride concentrations as (a) ppm Cl (i.e.,
μgCl gOS–1) and (b) a percentage compared
to initial leachable chloride analysis–averaged data where
error bars represent the standard deviations on multiple runs at the
same temperature (small-scale can 1 and can 2 samples and experiments
40–41; i.e., larger scale heat treatments on can 2 samples
only). All experiments heated in air with a 2 h hold time at the peak
(set) temperature with cover air flow at 250 mL min–1 maintained for an initial period of cooling (for sample identification,
see the Supporting Information).

Conclusions for full scale operations
are that temperatures of
750–800 °C will reduce the leachable chloride remaining
on the powder post-heat treatment to a low level, and there is little
benefit in increasing temperatures beyond this. The choice of residence
times depends on the bed depths, but the 2–4 h hold time at
the peak (set) temperature is probably a suitable compromise between
performance and throughput. Perhaps, the more influential parameter
is bed depth, and efforts to maintain thinner powder beds should probably
be prioritized.

3.6 Reheat Experiments
Some samples were
subjected to further heat treatments either in an inert atmosphere
and/or at a lower temperature (representative of long-term storage
conditions). Three samples that had been heat treated in air at 600,
700, and 800 °C (experiments 12, 16, and 4, respectively) were
reheated to 400 °C in air. Two further samples (experiments 40
and 41) were reheated in argon to 400 °C (labeled experiments
6X and 7X), and the volatile chloride concentrations were close to
zero in these cases. LOH were low in all cases, especially so for
samples originally heat treated at 700–800 °C, and the
measured LOH values probably represent a small uptake of atmospheric
gases during the short periods of storage in the air atmosphere glove
box prior to the second heat treatment (Figure 1). The volatile chlorides were low in all
cases consistent with the other data at 400 °C. These experiments
agree with data above in Table 4 where samples 58 and 59 were both reheated twice in argon
at 300 and 400 °C, respectively. Four samples, duplicates originally
heated at 600 and 800 °C (N1–4), were reheated to the
same temperatures under argon. The volatile fractions when reheated
to 600 or 800 °C under argon were very low in both cases, particularly
the 800 °C samples. Data are shown in Table 5, and together with data of Table 4, it is concluded that reheating
samples initially heat treated at 700 °C or above, at temperatures
equal to or below the first heat treatment temperature, does not lead
to significant additional volatilization.

3.7 Storage in Air
After heat treatments
in air, most samples were stored in an air atmosphere glove box prior
to being bulked and removed from the facility. Can 1 samples were
subsampled again after varying periods of storage and subsamples leached.
These data are compiled in Figure 5, which compares the leachable chloride values measured
post-heat treatment with values obtained from the later analyses.
Surprisingly, it was found that the leachable chloride content increased
in almost all samples that were tested. The only exceptions were samples
heated at the highest temperatures, 900 and 950 °C, and one sample
heated at 700 °C. The anomalous 700 °C sample (Expt. 30)
was one of four samples that were then subsampled several times over
an extended period. From Figure S3 (Supporting
Information), it is seen that, although trends are generally upward,
two of the samples showed rather erratic behavior, while the other
two (Expts. 28 and 30, heat treatments at 500 and 700 °C, respectively)
showed steady increases. Two can 2 samples (experiments 6X and 7X)
were also reanalyzed by the leaching method after periods of interim
storage and showed the same trend (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Leachable chloride concentrations of samples
after heat treatment
compared to values obtained after variable periods of storage in the
air atmosphere glove box (for sample identification, see the Supporting
Information).

The data of Figure 5 indicate the probability
of a nonleachable form of chloride that
is still present after heat treatment and that reforms leachable chloride
species on storage in air, probably due to a rehydration of surface
chloride by adsorption of water from the atmosphere. The potential
for this reequilibration is apparently reduced with increasing heat
treatment temperature. At the highest temperatures (>800 °C),
surface area reduction with sintering is probable;18 this reduces surface sites and thus the propensity for
water adsorption and reduces porosity potentially trapping residual
chloride. It is not obvious, however, why storage in air (week to
month timescale) should slowly liberate additional leachable chloride
above that released immediately by leaching in a caustic solution
after heat treatment (hour to day timescale) unless it is a kinetically
slow process.

The implications for retreatment and storage are
that there is
an inventory of chloride still present after heat treatment and that
exposure to moist air will result in a slowly changing product due
to adsorption of water and other atmospheric gases with a concomitant
increase of leachable chloride species. Again, heat treatment temperatures
of ∼800 °C or higher will reduce this effect, but exposure
to moist air following heat treatment in air is to be avoided (operationally,
cooling and packaging under dry argon are advisable22).

3.8 Effect of Relative Humidity
on Product Stability
The can 2 samples that had been preexposed
to a 95% RH atmosphere
before heat treatment at 800 and 950 °C (experiments 42 and 43,
respectively) were split in half. One portion from each was reheated
at the same temperature within 1 week, and one portion was rehumidified
for several weeks and then reheated again at the same temperature
as before. Results are shown in Figure 6. The leachable chloride is reduced as expected on
the first heat treatment, and then, there is a small increase in the
leachable chloride for the short-stored samples due to storage in
the air atmosphere glove box. This is reduced after the second heat
treatment. The portions that had been rehumidified at 95% RH showed
much larger increases (∼1000 ppm) in the leachable chloride
concentration that was then volatilized on the second heat treatment.
It is apparent that, even after heating at a maximum temperature of
950 °C, some residual nonleachable chloride remains in the powder
that can be converted to leachable chloride species on exposure to
humid atmospheres and can then be volatilized on reheating.

Figure 6 Leachable and
volatile chloride concentrations in heat treatments
(HT, at 800 or 950 °C) of prehumidified can 2 samples (experiments
42 and 43) after the first heat treatment, after a second heat treatment,
and after heat treatment following rehumidification of the sample
(for sample identification, see the Supporting Information).

3.9 Uncertainties
Errors and uncertainties
in these experiments are of interest since the approach is basically
phenomenological in drawing conclusions from a series of heat treatment
experiments made under similar conditions but without a clear understanding
of the underlying reactions. There are several potential sources of
errors including:I. Variations in experimental conditions
from set parameters, for example, temperature fluctuations, gas flow
rates, etc. Small variations in experimental conditions are expected
from set parameters, and Figures 2b and 4b include error bars
calculated from standard deviations of multiple runs at the same temperature.
Uncertainties have been further assessed by replicate heat treatment
runs on samples from the same aliquot under nominally the same set
of conditions and without long periods of storage in the air atmosphere
glove box between replicate runs (Table S1, Supporting Information). These results indicate that leachable
concentrations typically vary by <100 ppm Cl while the variation
in volatile chloride is somewhat higher (up to 352 ppm), noting that
these data only represent a limited temperature range of 600–800
°C.

II. Variations
in samples from the same
batch. The initial (leachable) chloride concentrations are measured
for each sample prior to heat treatment, and the spread of concentrations
for multiple samples of the different aliquots from both cans is <10%.
The only exception is aliquot 1.5 in which there is a spread of 14%
across three samples. This is probably due to the delay between experiments
31 (3420 ppm Cl) and 58 and 59 (4400 and 4420 ppm Cl, respectively).

III. Analytical uncertainties
including
errors introduced in sampling, dilutions, and analysis. Repeat analyses
on the DIONEX suggest that these are small contributors to the overall
error (Section 2.4).



Overall, it is concluded that uncertainties
are around
±10% on the chloride concentration data in leached and caustic
trap sample analyses.

3.10 Total Dissolution
To date, only
a small number of samples have been subjected to total dissolution
in an initial effort to verify the presence of the nonleachable chloride
species that is proposed based on the above observations from heat
treatment experiments and resampling after storage. Figure 7 illustrates the results for
three powders heat treated at 700–800 °C and an as-received
sample from can 2. Again, there is an increase in leachable chloride
from the value obtained initially compared to an analysis made after
a period of storage in the air atmosphere glove box (prior to the
dissolution). It is also clear that the chloride concentrations determined
from total dissolution substantially exceed those obtained by leaching
in all four cases. Further, from Table 6, it is seen that, for the can 2 experiments at 700
and 800 °C, the sums of the chloride captured in caustic traps
and the chloride obtained by dissolutions come close to a full mass
balance based on the total chloride found in the as-received can 2
(aliquot 2) sample by the dissolution method (6620 ppm). This gives
added confidence in the methods. It is also seen from Table 6 that chloride concentrations
calculated from leaching and caustic traps only account for ∼60%
of the initial chloride inventory, rising to ∼70% after storage
in the air atmosphere glove box.

Figure 7 Comparison of chloride concentrations
determined by leaching and
dissolution methods for selected samples (*can 1.5 Expt. 31 sample
was also used in water desorption studies with heating and cooling
cycles up to ∼230 °C in a sealed reaction vessel16 prior to dissolution studies; for sample identification,
see the Supporting Information).

3.11 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
One as-received sample of can 1 powder was analyzed
by SEM. This
shows that the PuO2 powder comprises agglomerates of particles
with a size range of approximately 5 to 40 μm with a mean size
of approximately 14 μm. Figure 8 shows typical SEM images where agglomerates are composed
of particles with two distinct morphologies: square planar and trapezoidal.
Both these morphologies have been reported previously for Magnox PuO2.18 In the square planar morphology,
the basic particles have a wide particle size distribution and are
randomly arranged and interlinked in the agglomerates. Most interesting
is that the particles look thin, their edges are rounded, and the
surface appears to be fissured and cracked, compared to the clearly
defined edges and surface of the typical Magnox PuO2 particles.6,18 It may be speculated that these effects could be due to either ageing
of the powder during prolonged storage or the presence of aggressive
species on the surface arising from high levels of chloride contamination,
although the materials were produced in a batch furnace and thus original
production conditions may also be a factor. The trapezoids seem less
affected by this erosion.

Figure 8 SEM images of as-received chloride-contaminated
PuO2 powder sampled from can 1.

Exemplar SEM images of can 2 powders after heat treatment
at 400
and 950 °C are given in Figure 9. The two distinct morphologies are still observable
in the samples. The trapezoidal PuO2 particles are very
similar in dimensions and structure to those in the untreated can
1 sample, suggesting that the PuO2 particles with the trapezoidal
morphology remain rather unaffected by the heat treatment. However,
the square planar PuO2 particles are markedly different
to those of the untreated can 1 powder and the standard Magnox PuO2 product18 as they lack the complex
structure of interlinked square plates, and the surface of the particles
has a more fractured/cracked appearance. Overall, these have the appearance
of being quite severely degraded by the heat treatments, coming apart
in layers and layers disintegrating, even at 400 °C. In fact,
at 950 °C, there is some appearance of sintering (image bottom
right, Figure 9). Image
processing showed that the particle size ranges of the agglomerates
are typically in the regions of 1–30 and 5–40 μm
for heat-treated powders at 400 and 950 °C, respectively, with
a mean particle size of approximately 16 μm (950 °C). The
basic sizes of the crystallites that make up the particles have previously
been determined from XRD as 27.6, 28.6, and 52.2 nm for as received,
400 and 950 °C heat-treated samples.16

Figure 9 SEM
images of heat-treated chloride-contaminated PuO2 powders
sampled from can 2 (top row 400 °C and bottom row 950
°C heat treatments).

Differences between as-received and heat-treated powders
reflect
some combination of variations between two long-stored batches of
powder produced at different times (but on the same finishing line)
and the effects of heat treatment. More systematic SEM studies are
still needed to determine the effects of long-term storage and heat
treatment on PuO2 morphology.

3.12 Discussion
Previously,16 the change in the leachable
and volatile chloride
concentrations was interpreted in terms of the conversion of leachable
to nonleachable chloride species and volatilization of the chloride
species at high temperatures for a limited data set (redrawn here
as Figure 10b). The
additional data presented here (Figure 10a) illustrate this change over a wider temperature
range. It appears that at temperatures of 100–400 °C,
leachable chloride species are decreased, but chloride is not detected
in the caustic trap. Although from Figure 1, it is clear that other gases are being
desorbed in this temperature range. Above 400 °C, chloride is
increasingly volatilized, and as >100% recoveries are measured
above
∼700 °C, some initially nonleachable chloride species
must be volatilized in heat treatments. The deficiency in the mass
balance can be explained in two ways, either a conversion of leachable
to nonleachable chloride species or inefficient capture in the caustic
trap of volatile species. Losses of volatile chloride could occur
in the lines between the furnace and trap but with a cover gas flow
of 250 mL min–1, all quartz tubing and observations
from periodic wash outs suggest that this is not the main cause. Inefficient
capture of chloride in the caustic trap is possible—a few experiments
with secondary traps were inconclusive, finding 0, 1.0, 11.7, 4.6,
2.0, and 9.5% of the total volatile chloride in the second trap (experiments
6, 8, 5, 7, 4, and 67, respectively). HCl(g) is likely to be captured
efficiently, but a possible alternative explanation is that chlorine
gas is formed as a secondary product, due to the oxidation of HCl
by oxygen (eq 1), and
this is less efficiently trapped and/or analyzed by ion chromatography
in our setup. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that eq 1 is feasible, but it is kinetically
constrained by a high activation energy due to the need to break the
O–O bond. However, the well-established “Deacon process”
is based on the catalytic oxidation of HCl by O2 using
metal oxide catalysts such as CuO.23,24 Interestingly,
although there are no data on PuO2, other lanthanide and
actinide oxides (U3O8, CeO2, and
Ln2O3) are known to be good catalysts for this
reaction.25−28 The thermodynamic equilibrium ratio pHCl/pCl2 can be calculated for
likely relevant ranges of furnace conditions (see Table S2, Supporting Information). The calculations suggest
that, if it occurs, the Deacon reaction is most likely to be effective
in the mid-temperature range, approximately 300–500 °C,
which, interestingly, is where dips in the percentage recoveries are
seen (Figure 10).
However, even if chlorine is formed, it should dissolve in the caustic
trap according to eq 2 giving chloride and hypochlorite ions. So far, attempts to detect
hypochlorite ions in solution by ion chromatography have been inconclusive.
Gas mass spectrometric analysis of the off-gas stream is, therefore,
required to address this question, but this was outside the scope
of this phase of work. 1   2  

Figure 10 Stacked plots of relative
concentrations of chloride species for
(a) can 1 and (b) can 2 samples (using averaged data where multiple
runs at the same temperature were performed).

The heat treatment results at the higher temperatures (>100%
volatilization
at T ≥ 700 °C), and the increase in leachable
chloride with storage in an air atmosphere glove box or under 95%
RH clearly indicates that there must be an inventory of “nonleachable”
chloride species in the PuO2 powders. This nonleachable
chloride is strongly bound, not readily exchangeable with hydroxide
ions and volatile at high temperatures (over 700 °C); under some
conditions over time, it can convert to leachable forms. Total dissolutions
of selected samples have now confirmed the presence of nonleachable
chloride in an as-received sample and samples that were heat treated
at 700–800 °C. Moreover, the sums of residual chloride
determined from dissolution and the chloride values from the caustic
traps for the two can 2.2 samples heat treated at 700 and 800 °C
are basically mass balanced
with the total chloride concentration, as determined by dissolution,
in the as-received can 2.2 sample. The data of Table 6, therefore, strongly support not only the
existence of the nonleachable species but also the conversion of leachable
to nonleachable species during the heat treatment.

Previously,15,16 the speciation of chloride on
PuO2 was considered by reference to the mechanism for HCl
adsorption and desorption on TiO229 and alumina30 where HCl is dissociatively
adsorbed, and then, chemical reaction between OH and HCl forms Ti4+(OH2)Cl–. Acid sites (H3O+·Cl–) from interaction
between HCl(g) and adsorbed water are also proposed. Desorption at
lower temperatures is due to HCl elimination from the Ti4+(OH2)Cl– species and at higher temperatures
from the interaction of neighboring OH and Cl to give HCl and Ti–O.
Evidence for strongly bound chloride forms is suggested by Soxhlet
extractions followed by thermal treatment in air at 400 °C31 that replenished the extractable chloride. Siriwardane
and Wightman32 also found that a proportion
of HCl was strongly bound and not removed by reoutgassing at 400 °C
apart from one sample that, interestingly, had a more acidic, nonstoichiometric
surface (some Ti3+ present). Similarly, HCl adsorption
on alumina was only partially reversible, implying a chemisorption
process.33 Temperature-programmed desorption
studies for HCl on alumina determined an activation energy of 83.7
kJ mol–1, suggesting HCl was associated with surface
defects rather than physisorbed; this being consistent with a broad
range of sites of varying energies that were annealed by heating.34

The data presented in this paper on PuO2 remain broadly
consistent with the framework derived from the literature (see Scheme
1 in ref (15) based
on ref (29)) as water/chloride
interactions are obviously very important to adsorption/desorption
behavior.16 Leachable, presumably acidic,
chloride forms are present on the surface as well as strongly bound
or inaccessible nonleachable species. All the chloride is difficult
to volatilize, requiring temperatures above 400 °C before measurable
quantities are evolved, which suggests chemisorbed species. Leachable
and nonleachable forms appear to slowly interconvert at room temperature
and above 700 °C, and the nonleachable chloride can apparently
also be volatilized; this may be due to the additional energy input
to overcome the activation barrier for desorption, loss of surface
sites as the surface area reduces at the highest temperatures, and/or
the annealing of the radiation-damaged oxide at the highest furnace
temperatures.16 However, there are additional
complexities to these PuO2 powders due to the presence
of other adsorbed gases (e.g., nitrogen forming nitrate and carbon
dioxide) and radiolysis reactions due to the α-activity of PuO2 (e.g., refs (35−43)). Indeed, significantly elevated quantities of carbon and nitrogen
were measured in samples (Table 1). These surface chemical and radiation driven reactions
have been ongoing for several decades and are coupled with radiogenic
self-heating while in storage. Furthermore, PuO2 can form
substoichiometric Pu(III) and, at least at the surface, hyperstoichiometric
Pu(V) ions44−46 that could form species of the type PuOxCly at the surface. Further
spectroscopic studies are ongoing to try and identify the main surface
species. Regarding the surprisingly low SSA measured in these samples,
this implies that the coverage of several monolayers of adsorbed water,
chloride, NOx, and CO2 will
be present on the surface of PuO2. The chloride is not
volatile below ∼400 °C and so is presumably chemisorbed,
while ref (16) provides
evidence for interactions between chloride and water at the surface.
It seems possible that these adsorbates are blocking porosity leading
to an unrealistic measurement of SSA with the standard BET nitrogen
adsorption method. Further studies are ongoing to confirm this assumption.

4 Conclusions
In agreement with previous reports,15,16 chloride adsorbed
on the PuO2 surface was leachable at ambient temperature
but was surprisingly difficult to thermally desorb—requiring
temperatures above 400 °C. A quite wide range of samples taken
from different locations in two separate cans of legacy chloride-contaminated
PuO2 (production batches dating from 1974 and 1980) gave
similar results, giving confidence in the wider applicability of these
data. Unsurprisingly, removal of chloride and other gases (including
adsorbed water) from the PuO2 powders is improved by higher
temperatures, thinner powder beds, cover gas flow, and increased residence
time. Overall, temperatures of 700–800 °C and residence
times of 2–4 h represent good conditions for stabilization
of these materials in a thermal treatment process. Heating under air
and cooling and packaging under dry argon are required to minimize
risks of readsorption of gases and redistribution of residual chloride
from nonleachable species to leachable species. Total matrix dissolution
confirms the presence of nonleachable chloride species, supporting
other evidence from leaching and volatilization (analyses of chloride
in caustic traps) at >700 °C. From the experimental data,
including
previously reported data15,16 and with a review of
the related literature such as the study by Parfitt et al. on TiO2,29 it is the interactions between
HCl/chloride and water/hydroxyl species that are probably a key factor
in understanding the behavior of these chloride-contaminated PuO2 materials when heated. This is supported by our previous
work using a sealed vessel to measure pressure/temperature changes,
which indicated that water coadsorbs with chloride on the surface
of PuO2.16 Open questions, however,
remain as to the nature of the surface chloride and other species,
and whether chlorine gas is a possible desorption product under some
specific conditions.
