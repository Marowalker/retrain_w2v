Permeability glycoprotein
(Pgp) is an essential membrane-bound
transporter that efficiently extracts compounds from a cell. As such,
it is a critical determinant of the pharmacokinetic properties of
drugs. Multidrug resistance in cancer is often associated with overexpression
of Pgp, which increases the efflux of chemotherapeutic agents from
the cell. This, in turn, may prevent an effective treatment by reducing
the effective intracellular concentrations of such agents. Consequently,
identifying compounds that can either be transported out of the cell
by Pgp (substrates) or impair Pgp function (inhibitors) is of great
interest. Herein, using publically available data, we developed quantitative
structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models of Pgp substrates
and inhibitors. These models employed a variable-nearest neighbor
(v-NN) method that calculated the structural similarity between molecules
and hence possessed an applicability domain, that is, they used all
nearest neighbors that met a minimum similarity constraint. The performance
characteristics of these v-NN-based models were comparable or at times
superior to those of other model constructs. The best v-NN models
for identifying either Pgp substrates or inhibitors showed overall
accuracies of >80% and κ values of >0.60 when tested on
external
data sets with candidate Pgp substrates and inhibitors. The v-NN prediction
model with a well-defined applicability domain gave accurate and reliable
results. The v-NN method is computationally efficient and requires
no retraining of the prediction model when new assay information becomes
available—an important feature when keeping QSAR models up-to-date
and maintaining their performance at high levels.

Introduction
Permeability glycoprotein
(Pgp), a member of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter family, is an important cell-membrane protein that
regulates the efflux of foreign substances out of the cell.1−3 Pgp primarily exports hydrophobic compounds via an ATP-dependent
process3 (Scheme 1). Compounds that interact with Pgp can be
classified into three categories: substrates, inhibitors, and modulators.4 Pgp causes substrates to undergo efflux from
the cell. By contrast, modulators and inhibitors both impair Pgp function;
hence, these terms are often used synonymously. As shown in Scheme 1,the
three most common ways to reduce Pgp function are (i) to block or
competitively antagonize the substrate from attaching to the binding
site (square), (ii) to inhibit the ATP binding site (triangle), and
(iii) to interfere with the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi (star).

(i) Drug binds to the substrate
binding site (■),5 (ii) ATP binds
to the ATP-binding site (▲), and (iii) hydrolysis of ATP to
ADP + Pi (★). Although only one binding site is
shown for simplicity, multiple binding sites could contribute to substrate
promiscuity.

In cultured cancer cell lines
and tumor models, overexpression
of Pgp generates drug-resistant phenotypes.2 Pgp overexpression is a major factor that contributes to multidrug
resistance (MDR), a phenomenon in which cells develop tolerance to
drugs even at lethal doses by pumping them out, thereby reducing their
cytotoxic effect.3 MDR is of great concern
because it is one of the major reasons for the failure of cancer chemotherapy
treatments, of which paclitaxel administration is perhaps one of the
best-known examples. Considerable effort is also being devoted to
identifying Pgp inhibitors that reduce drug resistance and improve
drug effectiveness.6,7 Several experimental assays, including
the monolayer efflux, calcein-AM, and ATPase assays,8,9 are available for assessing the compound transport across cellular
membranes. These assays, however, are resource intensive. In this
context, in silico models that identify inhibitors and substrates
offer a valuable alternative for early prescreening efforts to guide
the selection of compounds for experimental evaluation.

Several
computational models have been proposed to predict the
likelihood that a compound is a Pgp inhibitor10−15 or a substrate.15−17 Most of these models were developed using relatively
small data sets, with concomitant limitations in their reliability.
As such, the predictions of the models developed thus far are often
difficult to validate. One aim of this study was to address this issue.
We defined an applicability domain based on the premise that similar
molecules have similar activities. In this way, we attempted to ensure
that the models made a prediction only when a test molecule was similar
to any of the molecules in the set of training compounds.

We
also sought to test the utility of models that use an applicability
domain in predicting Pgp substrates. As noted above, Pgp substrates
are likely to be crucial for MDR because drugs that are Pgp substrates
will accumulate less in cells than those that are not. This is why
identifying Pgp substrates is often part of the early drug discovery
screening process.18 Yet, despite the efforts
that have been devoted to predicting Pgp inhibitors, the prediction
of Pgp substrates themselves has received little attention. Predicting
Pgp substrates is more challenging than predicting Pgp inhibitors
because their structural variability is likely to be high, given the
crucial role of Pgp in removing foreign substances from cells.

Here, we used our versatile variable-nearest neighbor (v-NN) method19 to develop the Pgp substrate and inhibitor identification
models and compared how they performed in relation to previously published
model constructs. We also combined the data sets from Chen et al.12 and Broccatelli et al.10 to develop a v-NN Pgp inhibitor model and analyzed its performance.
Our results show that these v-NN models perform well and suggest that
reliable predictions can easily be made with the use of an applicability
domain.

Results and Discussion
Prediction of Pgp Substrates
We
applied our v-NN method
to construct a Pgp substrate model, using experimentally determined
substrates and nonsubstrates. The v-NN model predicts whether a test
molecule is a substrate or a nonsubstrate on the premise that similar
molecules have similar biological activities. If a test molecule is
highly similar to a reference substrate molecule, it will be classified
as a substrate. To increase the level of confidence in our predictions,
we defined an applicability domain for the v-NN model by introducing
a similarity threshold value (Tanimoto-distance threshold d0) that had to be met to make a prediction.
We selected the two v-NN parameters in eq 1 (smoothing factor h and
Tanimoto-distance threshold d0), according
to the performance on the training set with respect to the κ
value and overall coverage. We evaluated the performance of the model
using the 10-fold cross validation, in which we randomly grouped the
data set into ten equally sized groups and then used nine of the groups
to construct the model and one to validate it. Subsequently, this
process was repeated ten times so that all groups were left out once,
and the final result was reported as the average.

Figure 1a shows the performance measures
of the model as a function of the Tanimoto-distance threshold d0 at a constant smoothing factor h of 0.6. The best model performance, as measured by the κ value,
was achieved at d0 = 0.2, with an accuracy
of 95%, sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 75%, and κ value
of 0.77 (Figure 1a).
However, this resulted in low coverage (9%), wherein the majority
of compounds did not meet the Tanimoto-distance threshold.

Figure 1 Performance
measures of the v-NN Pgp substrate model as a function
of the Tanimoto-distance threshold d0 at
a constant smoothing factor h of 0.6 (a) and as a
function of the smoothing factor h at a constant
Tanimoto-distance threshold d0 of 1.0
(b), evaluated using the 10-fold cross validation.

A set of high-accuracy (HA) parameters (h = 0.6
and d0 = 0.6; Figure 1a, arrow) was selected by adjusting the smoothing
factor and the Tanimoto-distance threshold, which increased the coverage
from 9 to 60%, while maintaining good performance measures (accuracy
of 77%, sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 75%, and κ value
of 0.53). In taking this approach, we sacrificed some coverage because
we could not make predictions for 40% of the compounds. Although this
inability may appear to be a limitation of our method, in our opinion,
it is preferable not to make any prediction at all if these compounds
are predicted merely by chance. Instead, these molecules should be
tested experimentally. Once the results are known, the new data should
then be included to the training set, so that the new model can make
reliable predictions for similar compounds, effectively expanding
the applicability domain of the model. Most published quantitative
structure–activity relationship (QSAR) studies have not assessed
the applicability domain of their models. Although this conveys the
impression that these models are universally applicable, we and others
have shown that the performance of a QSAR model rapidly deteriorates
as new studies explore chemical spaces that differ from the space
that was used to build the original model.20,21 This is one of the great challenges in QSAR development. In tackling
this problem, we consider the use of an applicability domain as a
necessary step to establish reliable in silico methods.

The
coverage of a QSAR model can be increased by the v-NN approach
in a straightforward fashion. Our v-NN Pgp substrate model achieved
nearly 100% coverage when we increased the Tanimoto-distance threshold
to 0.8 (Figure 1a).
This came at the cost of inferior prediction performance, as indicated
by the smaller κ values as well as the slightly lower accuracy
and specificity. To ensure a fair comparison of the performance of
our v-NN Pgp substrate model with that of previously proposed models,
we increased the Tanimoto-distance threshold to d0 = 1.0 and varied the smoothing factor h to achieve a set of high-coverage (HC) parameters (h = 0.3 and d0 = 1.0; Figure 1b, arrow) and enable our model
to make predictions for all compounds.

To test the performance
of the v-NN model in predicting Pgp substrates,
we used the data set of Li et al.16 and
their published Bayesian classifier (BC) model, which employs ECFP10
fingerprints and eight molecular properties (MPs). Table 1 summarizes the results of our
v-NN model and the BC model. To compare the models directly, the table
shows the model parameters with the 10-fold cross validation, the
performance measures we calculated by using their data sets, and the
BC model parameters reported by Li et al.

d Training set compounds for Pgp were

The best-performing v-NN model outperformed
the BC + MP model with
respect to accuracy, sensitivity, and κ value (Table 1). Of these three measures,
high sensitivity is desirable because it assures high confidence in
positive predictions. Even when we equated the v-NN model with the
BC + MP model in terms of coverage (by using HC parameters), the sensitivity
remained high in both the training and test sets, 0.78 and 0.80, respectively,
compared with the corresponding sensitivities of 0.65 and 0.66 for
the BC + MP model. However, the κ value is perhaps the most
accurate measure for the performance of a prediction model because
it takes into account the agreement occurring by chance. Although
the v-NN model with the HC parameters performed on par with the BC
+ MP model on the training set with respect to the accuracy and the
κ value, it performed better than the BC + MP model on the external
test set. Furthermore, the v-NN model with the HA parameters showed
superior accuracy and κ values on both the training and test
sets.

To test the robustness of our model, we compared its performance
when it was trained on the data set of Li et al. with that when it
was trained on a randomized data set. As the bottom two rows of Table 1 show, the performance
of the model deteriorated as expected. The accuracy, sensitivity,
and specificity during randomized training were all approximately
0.5, a value much lower than the values during training with conventional
data sets (0.65–0.78, top two rows of Table 1). In particular, the κ value was approximately
zero, indicating that the model predictions were no better than those
expected by chance. That our model is sensitive to relationships among
compounds in the training data set suggests that it reliably predicts
Pgp substrates.

Prediction of Pgp Inhibitors
Following
the modeling
procedure we pursued when constructing the Pgp substrate model, we
collected Pgp inhibitor data from the studies of Broccatelli et al.10 and Chen et al.12 and analyzed them separately for comparison, before combining them
into one large data set. Broccatelli et al. developed a model by employing
a combination of molecular interaction field-based technologies and
by considering pharmacophore features as well as physicochemical properties
related to membrane partitioning. They used VolSurf+ descriptors22 to model the physicochemical properties and
fingerprints for ligands and proteins (FLAP)23 to identify the most important pharmacophore features.

Table 2 shows the results
of the v-NN model and the FLAP/VolSurf+ model of Broccatelli et al.
As in the case of predicting Pgp substrates, we determined two sets
of v-NN parameters to achieve HC and HA via a series of 10-fold cross
validations. We selected the v-NN HA parameters (h = 0.2 and d0 = 0.6) to establish a limited
applicability domain and thereby optimize the performance. This resulted
in an excellent performance on the training set, with an accuracy
of 91%, sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 88%, κ value of 0.81,
and coverage of 67%. The HC parameters (h = 0.2 and d0 = 1.0) allowed us to make a prediction for
all molecules (100% coverage). The v-NN models performed well compared
with the FLAP/VolSurf+ model on all three data sets (training, internal
test, and external test). The v-NN model with the HA parameters gave
the best performance and the most reliable result on all data sets.

We also compared the performance
of our model when it was trained
on the data set of Broccatelli et al. with that when it was trained
on a randomized data set. The performance deteriorated as expected,
and the low κ values indicated that the model predictions were
no better than those expected by chance (bottom two rows of Table 2).

Table 3 compares
the performance of v-NN models that used either HC parameters (h = 0.1 and d0 = 1.0) or HA
parameters (h = 0.4 and d0 = 0.5) with that of the model developed by Chen et al.12 using their data set. To directly compare our
results with those of Chen et al., the training set was evaluated
using the leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation instead of the 10-fold
cross validation. Their model, which uses the BC model and eight molecular
descriptors (BC + MP), performed as well as our v-NN models. The performance
of the v-NN model with HA parameters was comparable to that of the
BC + MP model, with an overall accuracy of 80%, sensitivity of 91%,
and coverage of 72% for the test set. The v-NN models displayed excellent
accuracy and sensitivity but showed low specificity. This may be attributed
to our unbalanced data set, which included more Pgp inhibitors than
noninhibitors. This asymmetry could have led to the low specificity
of our models by increasing their likelihood of falsely classifying
a proportionally greater number of noninhibitors as inhibitors.

As in comparing the v-NN Pgp inhibitor
model with a previous model
by Broccatelli et al. (Table 2), we compared the performance of the former model when it
was trained on the data set of Chen et al. with that when it was trained
on a randomized data set. The performance again deteriorated as expected,
and the low κ values indicated that the model predictions were
no better than those expected by chance (bottom two rows of Table 3).

Prediction
of Pgp Inhibitors in the Combined Data Set
The v-NN method
relies on the diversity of the compounds used to
construct the model. A large set of diverse molecules will result
in a greater applicability domain of the model. We therefore combined
the two inhibitor data sets into a single data set containing 1319
Pgp inhibitors and 957 noninhibitors. The data set was split into
a training set of 1219 inhibitors and 857 noninhibitors and an evaluation
set of 100 inhibitors and 100 noninhibitors. Table 4 shows the performance of the v-NN models
in predicting Pgp inhibitors in this larger data set. The v-NN model
with HA parameters (h = 0.3 and d0 = 0.5) performed well on the training set as evaluated
by the 10-fold cross validation, with an overall accuracy of 87% and
a κ value of 0.68 in providing predictions for 75% of the compounds.
The 75% coverage for the combined training set was greater than that
achieved for the models constructed using only the data set of Broccatelli
et al.10 or Chen et al.,12 which showed coverage values of 67% and 68%, respectively
(with the HA training values in Tables 2 and 3). On the evaluation set,
the v-NN model generated predictions for 162 of the 200 compounds
(81%) and correctly predicted 92% of the Pgp inhibitors. The v-NN
model performed well even at 100% coverage, which was achieved by
using the HC parameters (h = 0.1 and d0 = 1.0); overall accuracies for the training and evaluation
sets were 83 and 77%, respectively.

Klepsch et al.11 also combined the data
sets from Broccatelli et al.10 and Chen
et al.12 The models that performed best
on their training set were the random forest (RF) and support vector
machine (SVM) models, with overall accuracies of 86% and 75%, respectively.
The corresponding accuracies of the RF and SVM models on their external
test set were 75% and 73%, respectively. Klepsch et al. also presented
a structure-based approach to predict Pgp inhibitors and noninhibitors
by using the scoring function (ChemScore) in the docking program GOLD.24 Even when they combined the scoring function
with the logP value, they achieved only a total accuracy of 77%. This
is lower than the accuracy of their ligand-based models. Although
these results are comparable to our HC results, the v-NN model achieved
higher accuracy with the HA parameters. We note, however, that their
findings cannot be directly compared with our results because they
used slightly different procedures for selecting their training and
test sets.

Selectivity of the Pgp Substrate and Inhibitor
Predictions
Previous studies have investigated the MPs of
Pgp substrates and
inhibitors. Poongavanam et al.15 analyzed
the occurrence of different functional groups and found that (1) Pgp
substrates are typically amphipathic (i.e., possessing both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic parts) and lipophilic, with three commonly occurring
features: an aromatic system, an ether moiety, and an amine group;
and (2) Pgp inhibitors are lipophilic and nonpolar, often containing
an alkyl aryl ether, an aromatic amine, and a tertiary aliphatic amine
group. Although Pgp substrates and inhibitors differ in some respects,
they also share the property of being hydrophobic. If our assumption
that similar molecules have similar MPs is correct and if the MPs
of Pgp substrates differ distinctly from those of Pgp inhibitors,
then v-NN models that perform well in predicting Pgp substrates should
be poor at predicting Pgp inhibitors. Conversely, those predicting
Pgp inhibitors should be poor at predicting Pgp substrates. Therefore,
we tested whether the models developed to predict Pgp substrates would
show poor performance when tested with Pgp inhibitors and vice versa.
In both cases, the accuracy levels were ∼50% and the κ
values were close to zero (Figure 2). These results confirm that both the v-NN substrate
and inhibitor models selectively identify the two different classes
of Pgp compounds.

model

Conclusions
Our v-NN-based models outperformed current
models in predicting
Pgp substrates and performed comparably to methods such as FLAP/VolSurf+
in predicting Pgp inhibitors. The advantages of using the v-NN method
are as follows: (i) reliable predictions by using an applicability
domain to ensure that only compounds within the chemical space of
the compounds used to construct the model are selected for prediction
and (ii) the absence of any need for retraining when new compounds
are added to the model. We emphasize the importance of using a prediction
model that is easily updated with new compound information and assay
data, given our previous demonstration that feeding such models with
even a small amount of assay data for truly novel compounds can greatly
enhance their applicability domains.20

Methods
Pgp Data
Sets
We used the Pgp substrate data collected
by Hou and co-workers from monolayer efflux, ATPase activity, and
rhodamine-123/calcein-AM fluorescence assays.16 This data set consists of measurements for a training set of 313
substrates and 309 nonsubstrates and those for a test set of 109 substrates
and 91 nonsubstrates.

We extracted the data sets for Pgp inhibitors
from Chen et al.12 and Broccatelli et al.10 The data set from Chen et al. consists of measurements
for a training set of 609 inhibitors and 393 noninhibitors and those
for a test set of 188 inhibitors and 112 noninhibitors. The data set
from Broccatelli et al. consists of measurements for three sets of
compounds: (i) a training set of 334 inhibitors and 438 noninhibitors,
(ii) an internal test set of 37 inhibitors and 47 noninhibitors, and
(iii) an external test set of 274 inhibitors and 144 noninhibitors.

Combining the Pgp inhibitor data sets from Chen et al. and Broccatelli
et al. and removing duplicates resulted in a combined data set consisting
of a training set of 1219 inhibitors and 837 noninhibitors and an
evaluation set of 100 inhibitors and 100 noninhibitors. All data sets
and corresponding simplified molecular input line entry specifications
(SMILES) are available in the Supporting Information.

v-NN Method
The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method has
been widely used to develop QSAR models.25 This method rests on the premise that compounds with similar structures
have similar activities. One difficulty with the k-NN method is that
it always gives a prediction for a compound based on a constant number, k, of nearest neighbors regardless of the dissimilarity
between the query and reference compounds. To correct for this shortcoming,
we proposed a variable-nearest neighbor (v-NN) method19 that uses all nearest neighbors that meet a structural
similarity criterion. When no nearest neighbor meets the criterion,
the v-NN method makes no prediction. The predicted biological activity y is a weighted average across structurally similar neighbors 1  where di denotes the Tanimoto distance between a query molecule
for
which a prediction is made and a molecule i of the
training set, yi is the
experimentally measured activity value of molecule i, v denotes the total number of molecules in the
training set that satisfy the condition di ≤ d0, h is a smoothing factor that dampens the distance penalty,
and d0 is a Tanimoto-distance threshold
beyond which two molecules are no longer considered to be sufficiently
similar to be included in the average. The yi values were set to 1 for predicting Pgp
substrates or inhibitors and 0 for predicting nonsubstrates or noninhibitors.
The v-NN method has two adjustable parameters that influence performance:
the Tanimoto-distance threshold d0 and
the smoothing factor h. To identify structurally
similar compounds, we used Accelrys extended-connectivity fingerprints
with a diameter of four chemical bonds (ECFP4).26 We wish to emphasize that h and d0 are unique and that they need to be optimized
for each set of fingerprints. In this study, we tested the performance
of three frequently used fingerprints: ECFP, FCFP, and MDL Public
Keys.27 We have included the performance
measures of v-NN models that used different fingerprints in Tables S8 and S9. All of the tested fingerprints
allowed the v-NN model to perform well on the data sets, with comparable
results. For this study, we chose the ECFP4 fingerprints that have
previously been reported by Duan et al.28 and Hert et al.29 to show the best overall
performance in retrieving the active compounds of many diverse data
sets.

Model Performance Measures
We used the following metrics
to measure the quality of the classification models 2   3   4   5  where TP, TN, FP, and FN
denote true positive,
true negative, false positive, and false negative, respectively. κ
is a metric for assessing the quality of binary classifiers. Pr(e) is an estimate of the probability of a correct prediction
by chance.30 It is calculated as 6  

Sensitivity is a measure of a model’s
ability to correctly detect true positives, whereas specificity measures
a model’s ability to detect true negatives. κ compares
the probability of correct predictions to the probability of correct
predictions by chance. Its value ranges from +1 (perfect agreement
between model prediction and experiment) to −1 (complete disagreement),
with 0 indicating no agreement beyond that expected by chance.

We also calculated the coverage, which is defined as the proportion
of test molecules with at least one nearest neighbor that exceeded
the similarity criterion. The coverage is a measure of how many test
compounds are within the applicability domain of a prediction model.
