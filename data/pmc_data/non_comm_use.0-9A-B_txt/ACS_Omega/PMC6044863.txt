Single-molecule force spectroscopy
greatly benefits from site-specific
surface immobilization and specific probing with a functionalized
cantilever. Here, we describe a streamlined approach to such experiments
by covalently attaching mechanically stable receptors onto proteins
of interest (POI) to improve pickup efficiency and specificity. This
platform provides improved throughput, allows precise control over
the pulling geometry, and allows for multiple constructs to be probed
with the same ligand-modified cantilever. We employ two orthogonal
enzymatic ligation reactions [sortase and phosphopantetheinyl transferase
(Sfp)] to covalently immobilize POI to a pegylated surface and to
subsequently ligate the POI to a mechanically stable dockerin domain
at the protein’s C-terminus for use as a high-strength pulling
handle. Our configuration permits expression and folding of the POI
to proceed independently from the mechanically stable receptor used
for specific probing and requires only two short terminal peptide
sequences (i.e., ybbR-tag and sortase C-tag). We applied this system
successfully to proteins expressed using in vitro transcription and
translation reactions without a protein purification step and to purified
proteins expressed in Escherichia coli.

Introduction
In recent years, the
field of single-molecule force spectroscopy
(SMFS) has implemented many developments in bioconjugation to improve
upon the classical approach of nonspecific pulling experiments by
moving to specific, often covalent surface functionalization.1,2 Traditionally, polyproteins are recombinantly expressed as fusion
constructs framed by several repeats of marker domains of known unfolding
patterns (often Ig-like domains) and nonspecifically deposited onto
a surface.3 A bare cantilever tip is then
indented into the surface in an attempt to pickup and stretch single
polyprotein chains on opposing ends by nonspecific adhesion. In case
the number of domain unfoldings in the recorded data trace exceeds
the number of domains on each side of the proteins of interest (POI),
an N- to C-terminal stretching of the POI can be concluded.

In contrast to the nonspecific attachment, site-specific anchoring
and probing approaches offer many advantages. They allow for homogeneous
surface preparation as the immobilization geometry is defined; the
usage of spacer molecules such as polyethyleneglycol (PEG) diminishes
possible surface interaction effects. Drawbacks of unspecific probing—such
as low-pickup efficiencies or the requirement of recombinant expression
of large polyproteins—have been addressed by utilizing the
receptor–ligand pairs as pulling handles to provide a specific
interaction by which force can be applied to the POI. Systems such
as StrepII-tag-Strep-Tactin,4 streptavidin–biotin,5,6 GCN4-peptide–antibody,7 and cohesin–dockerin
domains8−10 are only a few of the interactions that have been
employed for this purpose.

These pulling handles classically
are genetically appended to the
POI and expressed as fusion proteins. The fusion proteins are then
covalently immobilized through one end of the POI and probed by ligand-functionalized
cantilever-tips that recognize the respective receptor on the other
end. A wide range of forces are accessible by utilizing short tags
such as the StrepII-tag (116 pN at a loading rate of 4 nN s–1 if the tag is C-terminal and 46 pN at 4 nN s–1 if the tag is N-terminal4) and biotin
(257 pN5), as well as that with larger
handles such as the interaction between type-3 dockerin and cohesin
E from Ruminococcus flavefaciens, reaching
up to 700 pN at 100 nN s–1.10 These high-force interactions allow characterization of very stable
proteins such as the unfolding of several Titin-Ig domains in series.

However, recombinant expression of a fusion between a (possibly
large) POI and a large handle-protein (e.g., 29 kDa for CohE) can
be cumbersome. The resulting fusion proteins might be insoluble or
the correct folding of the POI might be affected by the presence of
the fusion domains during translation and folding. Here, we utilize
two orthogonal enzymatic ligation reactions to achieve sortase and
phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Sfp)-mediated covalent surface attachment
and post-translational modification of several POIs with dockerin
handles by sortase-mediated11,12 ligation. This allows the expression of only the protein
domain of interest without risking to affect proper folding. The very robust interaction of type-3 dockerin and cohesin from R. flavefacienswas already shown to be functional
over repeated measurements of about 24 h,10 which is an important requirement for multiplexing atomic force
microscopy (AFM) experiments.

Furthermore, we combined this
technique with in vitro expression
of the POI in a cell-free system. Because smaller proteins are, in
general, expressed with higher yields,13 the reduced size of the protein construct to be expressed is beneficial.
This allows for a fast and easy workflow from plasmid DNA to covalently
immobilized proteins containing mechanostable handles without the
need for bulk expression. We anticipate that our approach will aid
in highly parallel mechanical screening of mutant proteins, which
benefits from the in vitro expression, obsoleting the need for protein
purifications and benefitting from the enhancements in force spectroscopy
throughput and robustness.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Design
We selected Titin-Ig domains14 and superfolder
green fluorescent protein (sfGFP)15 as
the exemplary POIs for this study, as they
are well-documented in the literature, and enable comparison with
established methods. The POIs were cloned with a ybbR-peptide tag16 at their N-terminus and a sortase A recognition
sequence17 LPETGG at their C-terminus.
For force-spectroscopy handles, we used GGG-dockerin,10 which was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia
coli, purified, and ligated to the C-terminus of the
POI using ligation with sortase A. While preliminary experiments were
carried out with wild-type sortase A, an evolved mutant18 was ultimately used because of its superior
performance. On the cantilever side, CohE-CBM-ybbR was used and immobilized
at the ybbR-tag via Sfp-catalyzed ligation.16

The two specific enzymatic recognition sites located on the
termini of the POI ensure that only fully expressed proteins are measured
in SMFS-experiments. Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of the experiment.

Figure 1 Schematic of the experimental
setup. (I) POIs were either expressed
in bulk or synthesized using a cell-free expression mix. POIs contained
a ybbR-tag at the N-terminus and a sortase LPETGG tag at the C-terminus.
(II) Surface-bearing PEG-coenzyme A is covalently modified with POIs
via Sfp-catalyzed ligation. (III) Next, GGG-Doc is ligated to the
POI at the C-terminal end using the LPETGG sortase-tag for use as
a force spectroscopy pulling handle. (IV,V) Unfolding experiments
are conducted by approaching and retracting a CohE-CBM-functionalized
cantilever.

Cloning
Modified
pET28a plasmids encoding for ybbR-His-XylanaseT6(T129C)
(Geobacillus stearothermophilus)-Doc3
(R. flavefaciens), ybbR-His-sfGFP-DocI
(Clostridium thermocellum), and Titin-Ig
domains (repeats 27 to 32, repeat 34, human) were used as templates
for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with subsequent reconstitution
by Gibson19 assembly. The previously reported18 d59 sortase(P94R/D160N/D165A/K190E/K196T) mutant
was created by introducing the mutations via overlap extension PCR
followed by ligating the linearized plasmid using Kinase–Ligase–DpnI
(KLD) enzyme mix and KLD reaction buffer from the Q5 site-directed
mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). The chemically competent E. coli DH5-α cells were transformed [Life
Technologies GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany; 30 min on ice, 30 s heat shock
at 42 °C followed by 37 °C for 1 h in a super optimal broth
with catabolite repression medium] and plated on kanamycin-supplemented
agar plates. For amino acid sequences, see the Supporting Information.

Protein Expression and
Purification
All proteins were
expressed in NiCo21(DE3)RIPL cells, which were cultivated
in ZYM-5052 autoinduction media20 supplemented
with kanamycin and chloramphenicol. After pelleting, the cells were
lysed by sonication and then centrifuged at 4 °C, 39 000
rcf for 60 min. The supernatant was filtered to 0.22 μm and
applied to Ni-NTA columns (HisTrap FF, GE Healthcare Europe GmbH,
Freiburg, Germany). After washing with 6 column volumes of a buffer
containing 25 mM Tris, pH 8.4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 0.5
vol % Triton X-100, the bound fraction was eluted with an elution
buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 8.4, 300 mM NaCl, and 300 mM imidazole.

All protein solutions were concentrated using Amicon centrifugal
filter units (10k MWCO, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), followed
by buffer exchange to Ca-TBS buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 75 mM NaCl,
and 1 mM CaCl2) using polyacrylamide spin desalting columns.
Proteins were stored at −80 °C with glycerol added to
10% (v/v). For cell-free expression, 25 μM reactions of PURExpress
In Vitro Protein Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts)
were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, containing 300 ng plasmid DNA
coding for the POIs.

In case of MGGG-His-Doc, the N-terminal
methionine cleavage in E. coli was
sufficient for the preparation of GGG-His-Doc,
so that no additional protease digestion was necessary.

Surface Preparation
Surfaces and cantilevers for
force spectroscopy were silanized using (3-aminopropyl)-dimethyl-ethoxysilane
(APDMES, ABCR GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and PEGylated with α-maleimide-hexanoic-ω-NHS
PEG (NHS-PEG5000-Mal, Rapp Polymere, Tübingen, Germany) dissolved
to 25 mM in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer
(HEPES), 50 mM, pH 7.5 to provide suitable conditions for NHS coupling.
Then, the PEGylated surfaces and cantilevers were coupled to coenzyme
A (CoA, 1 mM) in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2.

Silicon nitride
cantilevers (BioLever mini BL-AC40TS-C2, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were
used as force probes. Silicone masks with a grid of 1 mm-diameter
holes (CultureWell Reusable Gaskets, Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR, USA),
were applied to the CoA-functionalized glass slides to create separated
incubation wells. Each purified POI was diluted to 50 μM in
Ca-TBS that was supplemented with 20 mM MgCl2 and Sfp enzyme
was added to 10 μM. The reaction mixtures were added to the
single incubation wells in the mask, enabling covalent immobilization
via Sfp-catalyzed ligation of CoA and the ybbR tags.

For cell-free
expression of the POIs, the cell-free expression
reaction mix (PURExpress, New England Biolabs, MA, USA) was prepared
to contain 100 ng of plasmid DNA. The expression mix was incubated
at 37 °C for 2 h, then supplemented with Sfp enzyme to 10 μM
and directly applied to the micowells without further purification.
Sfp ligation reactions were performed for 2 h at room temperature.
After subsequent rinsing with Ca-TBS, the wells were incubated with
100 μM GGG-Doc protein and 10 μM sortase A for 1 h. After
rinsing with Ca-TBS, the silicon mask was removed, providing an array
of covalently linked proteins that were modified with the dockerin
handle at one end.

The sortase-catalyzed ligation reactions
for Figure 2 contained
10 μM ybbR-Titin-LPETGG,
10 μM GGG-Doc, and 10 μM of either wild-type d59 sortase
or the evolved pentamutant.18 The ligation
reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.

Each protein was immobilized at two separate spots that were then
incubated with either GGG-dockerin and sortase or GGG-dockerin but
not with sortase. To test for successful ligation of dockerins, CohE-CBM-ybbR-CoA647
was allowed to bind for 10 min at 300 nM, then rinsed and imaged immediately
afterward. Fluorescent intensities of each construct were normalized
to the intensity of the sortase-positive spot. (B) SDS-PAGE demonstrating

A (wt-Srt), pentamutant sortase A (eSrt), or no sortase as negative

For surface functionalization
tests, CohE-CBM-ybbR was labeled
with CoA647 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) in a reaction containing
25 μM CoA647, 10 μM CohE-CBM-ybbR, and 2 μM Sfp
in Ca-TBS supplemented with 20 mM MgCl2. The labeling reaction
was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Free dye and Sfp enzyme were
removed via preparative gel filtration with Ca-TBS as the running
buffer through a Yarra 3 μm SEC-3000 (Phenomenex, Torrance,
California, USA) column. Appropriate fractions [evaluated via sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)] were
pooled, diluted to 3 μM, supplemented with glycerol to 10% (v/v),
and stored at −80 °C.

Labeled surfaces were imaged
using ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
California, USA), with 625(30) nm/695(55) nm emission/excitation filters.
The exposure time was 30 s; for background subtraction, a blank and
clean cover slip was imaged with the same settings and an average
background signal was subtracted from the measured average intensities.
Intensities were quantified via Image Lab 5.2 (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
California, USA) volume tool.

Single-Molecule Force Spectroscopy
All data were obtained
using Ca-TBS. Measurements were taken with custom-built instruments
(driven by PI-731 piezo actuators, Physik Instrumente, Germany) in
conjunction with MFP-3D AFM controllers (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara,
USA). Upon approaching the sample surface with the cantilever tip,
the complex between cohesin/dockerin (C/D) was formed, and the cantilever
was retracted from the surface at a constant velocity of 800 nm s–1 while recoding the distance and cantilever deflection
at a sampling rate of 12 500 Hz. After each force–extension
curve was recorded, the sample was moved laterally by 100 nm to probe
a different molecule. For data analysis, force–distance curves
were transformed into contour length space using a freely rotating
chain model with quantum mechanical corrections for peptide backbone
stretching21 and then sorted by contour
length increments.22 Loading rates prior
to domain unfolding or complex dissociation were extracted by applying
a linear fit to the last 3 nm before the respective event and then
used in fitting the rupture-force histograms with the Bell–Evans
model.23

Results and Discussion
To test for successful surface functionalization, we incubated
surfaces that had been prepared as described in the Materials and Methods section with fluorescently labeled cohesin. Figure 2A confirms that if
sortase is ommited, no dockerin functionalization is achieved, whereas
if sortase was present to perform the ligation reaction, binding of
CoE-CBM-ybbR-CoA647 is observed. Figure 2B demonstrates successful ligation of GGG-dockerin
to ybbR-Titin-LPETGG and illustrates the superior performance of the
evolved sortase mutant d95/P94R/D160N/D165A/K190E/K196T18 in comparison with wild-type sortase A.

Typical single-molecule force–distance unfolding patterns
for the sortase-incubated spots are shown in Figure 3A. They exhibit the unbinding pattern of
CohE–Doc dissociation as characterized in previous publications,10 where dissociation can occur with or without
unfolding of the dockerin subdomain called x-module. The resulting
force–distance curves were transformed into contour length
space and then sorted by comparing the observed unfolding increments
(3B). Only curves exhibiting the 56 nm increment corresponding to
a full unfolding of the CBM-domain were classified to be the result
of probing a CohE–Doc complex. Furthermore, the curves were
sorted to exhibit no more than one increment corresponding to the
unfolding of sfGFP 79 nm and no more than seven increments corresponding
to Titin-Ig unfolding 28 nM. These increments result from the added
free contour length of the peptide chain upon unfolding the folded
protein domains and match the previously reported values.14,15,24 For these traces, unfolding forces
of the domains of interest were histogrammed with a bin width of 20
pN (Figure 3C).

7× Titin-Ig and sfGFP. (A) Force
distance traces showing complete unfolding of the POI (Titin-Ig unfolding
is shown in the upper trace, sfGFP in the lower trace). (B) Transformation
of traces from (A) into contour-length space. (C) Force histograms
of complex dissociation events and unfolding events of the POI: the
upper two panels contain data from the bulk-expressed proteins and
the lower two panels contain data from in vitro-expressed proteins.
C/D complex dissociation can occur with [as in both sample traces
shown in (A)] or without prior unfolding of the x-module, which is
a subdomain of the dockerin, resulting in two populations of the dissociation
forces. Each population was fitted with the Bell–Evans model.23

Despite its narrow tip apex, each cantilever is typically
functionalized
with multiple cohesin-anchors; hence, multiple receptor–ligand
complexes can form if dockerin-decorated surface is densely populated.
Therefore, we went for a rather sparse surface functionalization which
can be tuned by the incubation times of Sfp and sortase-catalyzed
ligation reactions and/or the substrate concentrations. Alternatively,
cantilevers with blunter tips could be used when more interactions
are desired. The achieved surface densities were in a suitable range
for SMFS, sparse enough to avoid multiple interactions but dense enough
to acquire good statistics. Probing attempts (1.24%) resulted in single
molecule unfolding traces satisfying the outlined criteria. In total,
142 Titin-Ig and 92 sfGFP single molecule traces were obtained within
11 h of measurement with a single cantilever (spring constant: 0.093
N m–1). If sortase had been omitted, no traces showing
unfolding of CBM and one of the POI were recorded. For probing of
in vitro-expressed Titin-Ig, 0.33% of attempts were successful, yielding
72 Titin-Ig unfoldings in 9 h of measurement, which was also probed
with a single cantilever (spring constant: 0.097 N m–1). Figure 3C shows
force histograms for unfolding events of sfGFP, the last of seven
Titin-Ig domain to unfold and the complex dissociation itself. This
was carried out for bulk-expressed and purified sfGFP and Titin-Ig,
as well as for Titin-Ig expressed in the cell-free system. Complex
dissociation events cluster into two populations that are characteristic
of Doc/Coh unbinding.10 The most probable
forces at which the POI unfold are  for sfGFP,  for the first, and  for the last Titin-Ig domain to
unfold
( and  for Titin-Ig expressed in the
cell-free
system), the asymmetrical full widths at half maximum of the distributions
are given in brackets. The most probable forces were determined by
fitting each histogram of unfolding forces with the Bell–Evans
model.23

The differences between
the most probable unfolding forces observed
for the POI expressed in the cell-free system and the bulk-expressed
proteins are within tolerance of errors resulting from cantilever
calibration.25

This method can be
easily applied to any recombinantly expressed
protein by adding the terminal peptide tags necessary for covalent
surface attachment and post-translational sortase-mediated ligation.
Owing to the terminal location of these tags, only nondigested and
fully expressed proteins are probed. This is especially advantageous
for cell-free expression systems, where the small quantity of expressed
protein often makes the usually necessary affinity purification cumbersome.

Conclusions
We developed a method that enables acquisition of SMFS datasets
of specifically probed and covalently immobilized single molecules.
By post-translationally modifying the POI with the high-force interactions
of the Coh/Doc receptor–ligand system via sortase ligation,
we can probe even resilient proteins such as Titin-Ig domains with
high specificity and throughput, improving on the nonspecific polyprotein
method and eliminating the requirement of expressing the POI as large
fusion constructs with handle domains. The modular system of post-translational
attachment of the mechanostable pulling handle allowed us to probe
different proteins with the same cantilever. We also applied this
approach to proteins expressed in cell-free systems without further
purification while still selecting for only fully expressed proteins
owing to the specificity provided by the high-affinity pulling handle.
