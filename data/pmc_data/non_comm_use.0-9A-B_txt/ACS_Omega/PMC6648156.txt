Ab
initio calculations of 51 electronic states in the representation 2s+1Λ(±) of CdX (X = Se, Te) molecules
have been carried out by using the complete active space self-consistent
field and multireference configuration interaction (single and double
excitations with the Davidson correction). The potential energy along
with the static and transition dipole moment curves for the investigated
electronic states of the CdX molecules has been mapped. Consequently,
the spectroscopic constants Re, ωe, Be, and Te have been computed for the bound states. The spectroscopic
dissociation energy De, the zero-point
energy, and the ionicity are also calculated for the bound electronic
states X3Π, (1)1Σ+, (1)1Π, and (1)3Σ+. Rovibrational
calculation is performed for the X3Π, (1)1Σ+, (1)1Π, and (1)3Σ+ states of CdSe together with the X3Π, (1)1Σ+, and (1)1Π states of
a CdTe molecule. The Einstein coefficients of spontaneous and induced
emissions, A21 and B21, are computed for the transition between the electronic
states (1)3Σ+ and X3Π.
In the present work, the values are well-consistent with those available
in the literature.

1 Introduction
Among the II–VI
semiconductors, cadmium chalcogenides have
allured special recognition.1,2 On the basis of the
quantum confinement effect, the optical and electric properties of
their nanoparticles may be modified, reflecting a great potential
in many applications as photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.3 In particular, CdSe quantum dots are used in
a wide range of applications including solar cells,4 white light phosphors and light-emitting diode fabrication,5−8 optical chemical sensors,9 and in biomedical
imaging.10 Cadmium telluride is important
in the fabrication of solar cells, detectors of infrared and gamma
radiations, and field-effect transistors.11 The lack of theoretical investigation with regard to the excited
electronic states of CdX (X = Se, Te) molecules and the relationship
between the energy of solids and molecules12 provoked us to carry out high-level ab initio computations in the
present work. Concerning our calculation on the CdX molecules, two
very close and low-lying electronic states, 3Π and 1Σ+, exist with dissimilar electric properties
and barely different equilibrium geometries. The ground state of CdX
alters suddenly with a little adjustment of the geometry. In our study,
the X3Π state, associated with the first covalent
dissociation asymptote originating from a combination of the Cd(1S) and X(3P) ground states, is identified as a
ground state.

In 2007, Feng et al.13 reported the
equilibrium positions, the spectroscopic constants, and the vibrational
levels of the ground-state X3Π and the three low-lying
excited states 1Σ+, 3Σ+, and 1Π of the CdSe diatomic via the complete
active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method followed by multireference
configuration interaction (MRCI) calculation. On the other hand, the
near-equilibrium potential energy functions of the 1Σ+ and 3Π states have been calculated by MRCI
and coupled cluster calculations by Peterson et al.14 They found that the ground state is the 1Σ+ state, and the spectroscopic constants were calculated with
and without the inclusion of spin–orbit coupling for the lowest
two electronic states 1Σ+ and 3Π of the CdX molecules.

The lack of theoretical studies
on the halides and chalcogenides
of transition metals motivated us to investigate the transition-metal
halides15−19 in previous works. In the present research, we examine the CdSe
and CdTe molecules. Through ab initio calculations (CASSCF/MRCI),
we investigate the potential energy and dipole moment curves (DMCs)
for the lowest electronic states in the representation 2s+1Λ(±) of the singlet, triplet, and quintet electronic
states of the CdX molecules. For the bound states, the spectroscopic
constants are determined. The ionicity20−22 for X3Π
and the three low-lying excited states 1Σ+, 3Σ+, and 1Π are evaluated
using the computed constants. The emission coefficients are calculated
by examining the transition between (1)3Σ+ and X3Π.

With regard to the theoretical calculations
of the CdX molecules,
it is obvious that there are discrepancies in identifying the ground
state of the titled molecules. Because of the absence of the experimental
data, our investigated values should provide a basis for future experimental
studies on these molecules.

2 Computational Details
In the present study, we report the electronic properties and the
spectroscopy of CdSe and CdTe molecules in the neutral state. We examine
the low-lying singlet, triplet, and quintet electronic states via
SA-CASSCF23 followed by MRCI calculations
along with the Davidson correction that estimates the contributions
to higher excitation terms.24,25 The ab initio calculations
have been achieved via the computational chemistry program Molpro,26 together with the Gabedit interface.27 The quasi-relativistic effective core potentials
ECP28MWB and ECP46MWB28 are employed for
the Cd/Se and Te atoms, respectively. For each molecule, 26 electrons
are regarded as active ones, and their wave functions are determined
by the CASSCF computations. For each molecule, 19 active orbitals
are established (Cd: 4s, 4p, 4d, 5s, 5p, 6s; Se: 4s, 4p; 5s; and Te:
5s, 5p, 6s). Among these orbitals, the 4s, 4p, and 4d of cadmium and
the 4s of selenium together with the 5s of Te are frozen, so that
six valence electrons are clearly considered for each molecule. In
the C2v symmetry group,
the effective active space includes 5σ (Cd: 5s, 5p0, 6s; Se: 4p0, 5s) and 2π (Cd:
5p±1; Se: 4p±1) for the CdSe molecule
along with 5σ (Cd: 5s, 5p0, 6s; Te: 5p0, 6s) and 2π (Cd: 5p±1; Te: 5p±1) for CdTe that are distributed into irreducible representations:
5a1, 2b1, 2b2, 0a2, well-known
by [5, 2, 2, 0].

For both molecules, and in the representation 2s+1Λ±, the potential energy curves (PECs)
together with the
permanent DMCs of singlet, triplet, and quintet electronic states
have been investigated as a function of the internuclear distance R in the range 1.7 Å ≤ R ≤
8.27 Å with a step of 0.03 Å. In addition, the transition
DMCs (TDMCs) for the lowest electronic transitions (1)3Σ+–X3Π and (1)1Π–(1)1Σ+ are explored.

3 Results and Discussion
The CdX molecules, exhibiting 3Π and 1Σ+ as the lowest
lying bound molecular states, are
supposed to be mostly ionic around the equilibrium position. Consequently,
the chalcogen anion possesses either a pσ or pπ hole resulting in Σ+ or Π electronic
states (singlets and triplets), respectively. The 3Π
molecular state, correlating with the ground-state neutral atoms Cd(1S) and X(3P), is the ground state of the CdX molecules
if Cd and X remain uncoupled in their ground atomic states. The 1Σ+ state, dissociating to the 1D excited state of X and Cd(1S) in its covalent limit,
is due to the interaction between the 5s2 orbital of Cd
and the empty 4pσ orbital of X. Consequently, if
the Cd atom loses its two valence electrons to the chalcogenide atom
that possesses four electrons in its p orbital, Cd and X create a
closed shell, and the CdX molecules exist in the 1Σ+ molecular state. The transfer of electrons causes the dissociation
energy of 1Σ+ to be greater than that
of 3Π.13

To pinpoint
the low-lying electronic states of the CdSe and CdTe
molecules, the energies of the lowest covalent dissociation asymptotes
of the investigated states have been calculated. The computed energies
are compared with the NIST experimental data in the literature29 and the results are listed in Table 1. The association of the Cd(1S) and X(3P) ground states identifies the first
covalent dissociation asymptote of the CdX molecules that correlates
with the X3Π and (1)3Σ– molecular states. Because of the Cd(1S) ground state
and the X(1D) excited state, (1)1Σ+, (1)1Π, and (1)1Δ match
up with the second covalent asymptote. In the CdTe molecule, the third
asymptote arises from the [Cd (1S) + Te (1S)]
combination leading to the (1)1Σ+ molecular
state. The third dissociation asymptote of CdSe and the fourth asymptote
corresponding to CdTe, involving the excited Cd(3P0) state and the X(3P) ground state, harmonize with
the (1)1Σ+, (2)1Π, (1)1Δ, (2)1Σ–, (1)3Σ+, (2)3Π, (1)3Δ, (2)3Σ–, (1)5Σ+, (2)5Π, (1)5Δ,
and (2)5Σ– electronic states. The
(2)3Σ+ and (2)3Δ electronic
states are in agreement with the fourth covalent dissociation asymptote
of CdSe and the fifth asymptote of CdTe arising from the Cd(3P0) and X(1D) excited states. Our calculated
energy values with regard to the dissociative asymptotes are in acceptable
agreement with the experimental data,29 as illustrated in Table 1.

In the present work, 25 electronic
states are investigated for
the CdSe molecule. The ground state is found to be X3Π,
similar to the result obtained by Feng et al.,13 whereas in the study by Peterson et al.,14 the ground state is (1)1Σ+.
For X3Π, the value of ωe is 157.59
cm–1, revealing a qualitative agreement in comparison
with the reported theoretical value13 of
162.32 cm–1, with an error of 2.9%. The value of Re is computed to be 2.69 Å, which differs
from the latest theoretical value of 2.64 Å13 by 0.05 Å. According to our calculations, the value
of Te of (1)1Σ+ is only 852.27 cm–1 above X3Π
at Re = 2.44 Å, with ωe = 236.31 cm–1. Comparing our data with
the theoretical calculations found in the literature, Feng et al.13 found the values of Te, Re, and ωe as 1132.49
cm–1, 2.43 Å, and 240.31 cm–1 respectively. In the study by Peterson et al.,14 the ground state is 1Σ+, and
the first excited state is 3Π which lies 2039.1 cm–1 above the ground state. The electronic states of
identical quantum number Λ and symmetry can avoid a cross, whereas
the states of dissimilar symmetries can cross, leading to a modification
in the stability of the molecules. If these crossings are ignored,
an inaccurate chemical picture will appear.30 Τhe (1)1Σ+ and (1)1Π states of different symmetries and close potential energies
interact, causing crossing points between their PECs at R = 2.72 Å which are near the minimum of the later state. The
calculated values of Re for the (1)1Σ+ and (1)1Π states are
2.44 and 2.61 Å, respectively; moreover, the vibrational harmonic
frequency ωe and the dissociation energy of (1)1Σ+ are larger than that of (1)1Π by 36 cm−1 and 1914.28 cm−1, respectively. Τhe discrepancies in the spectroscopic parameters
between these two states can aid to identify them experimentally.
The (1)1Π state shows a minimum at Re = 2.61 Å, which corresponds to a transition energy
of 2765.59 cm–1, with regard to the minimum of the
X3Π state. The value of Re = 2.61 Å agrees with the earlier reported values theoretically,13 with a relative difference ΔRe/Re = 0.76%. Our calculated
value of ωe = 200.17 cm–1 reveals
a good correspondence with the theoretical value13 of 209.74 cm–1, with a relative difference
Δωe/ωe = 4.5%. For (1)3Σ+, the spectroscopic parameters ωe = 173.11 cm–1 and Re = 2.64 Å show reasonable consistency when compared to
the theoretical results,13 where the relative
differences are 17.3 and 2.2%, respectively. The electronic energy
of (1)3Σ+ is equivalent to Te = 15356.13 cm–1 above the ground state.
According to Figure 2, the potential energies of (1)3Σ+, (1)3Σ–, and (2)3Π are
very close to each other; consequently, (1)3Σ+ crosses with (1)3Σ– and
(2)3Π at 2.51 and 3.11 Å, respectively, which
leads to trouble in the experimental observation. The comparison between
our computed values of Be and De of the ground and the first three excited
states shows a good accordance with those given theoretically in the
literature,13 except for De of (1)3Σ+. However, the
comparison between the values of [De – G(0)] (Table 2) in the present work for (1)1Σ+, (1)1Π, and (1)3Σ+ and the value
of D0(31) reveals
an appreciable consistency. The bound states (2)3Π,
(2)1Σ+, (2)1Π, (1)1Σ–, (2)1Δ, (1–2)3Δ, (2)3Σ–, and (1)5Π are present here for the first time. All other singlet,
triplet, and quintet states are found to be repulsive, as shown in Figures 1–3.

A total of 26 electronic states for cadmium
telluride are explored
and mapped in Figures 4–6. The ground state is X3Π and the first excited state is 1Σ+ with Te = 822.32 cm–1. The results of the spectroscopic parameters along with the dipole
moments of 14 bound states are listed in Table 2. The spectroscopic dissociation energy De and the zero-point energy are also given in Table 2 for the bound electronic
states X3Π, (1)1Σ+, (1)1Π, and (1)3Σ+. Peterson
et al.14 reported that the ground state
of CdTe is 1Σ+ and the first excited state
is 3Π lying 1741.8 cm–1 above 1Σ+. The dissimilarities in the identification
of the ground and the first excited states with regard to the CdTe
molecule may provoke further theoretical and experimental studies
to confirm the results. Beyond these two states, the others are investigated
here for the first time.

By comparing the results obtained in
the present work with regard
to the CdSe and CdTe molecules, the following conclusions are drawn:
(i) in the same range of experimental dissociation energy limit of
[Cd + X] atoms, the number of molecular states in the CdTe molecule
is more than that of the CdSe molecule by one, as the Te atom exhibits
an excited (1S) state that is not present for the Se atom,
leading to an additional 1Σ+ state; (ii)
the PECs of the singlet, triplet, and quintet electronic states of
the CdSe and CdTe molecules follow the same trend, where the crossings
and the avoided crossings between these states reveal an identical
behavior; (iii) for identical bound states, the equilibrium bond distance Re increases along with the less electronegative
chalcogen; (iv) being inversely proportional to the reduced mass of
the molecule, the values of ωe and Be for the same molecular bound states of the CdX molecules
are higher for the selenides; (v) the spectroscopic dissociation energies
of the first three excited states 1Σ+, 3Σ+, and 1Π are greater for
the CdSe molecule, revealing a satisfactory consistency with the values
of D0.31

For the spin-free electronic states of CdX molecules, the permanent
dipole moments (PDMs) at the MRCI + Q level were investigated and
mapped in Figures 7–12. Table 2 shows the PDMs at the equilibrium
bond length of the bound states. The PDMs have been computed by considering
the more electronegative atom which is chalcogen (X) at the origin,
and the cadmium (Cd) atom moves along the positive z-axis. Upon losing its ionic character, an adiabatic state becomes
neutral and the corresponding DMC approaches zero. Some states exhibit
a positive dipole moment as in (1)5Σ+,
(1)5Π, (1)5Δ, and (2)5Σ–, indicating an ionic structure of Cdδ+Xδ− type. Other states, as
in (2)3Δ and (1)1Σ+,
reveal an ionic structure of Cdδ−Xδ+ along with the negative value of their dipole moment. The other
investigated electronic states have a change in the sign of the PDM
values relative to R. As two electronic states avoid
cross, an important modification in their dipole moment occurs where
the polarity of the atoms is inversed and the electronic character
is exchanged in this region. The avoided crossings at different internuclear
distances are mirrored as crossings in the DMCs, as mapped in the
avoided crossings among (1)1Δ/(2)1Δ,
(2)1Π/(3)1Π, and (1)3Δ/(2)3Δ. A large value of the magnitude of
the PDM is useful to align molecules in an optical lattice and to
study long-range dipole–dipole forces.32,33

The TDM functions of
(1)3Σ+–X3Π and
(1)1Π–(1)1Σ+ transitions
in the CdX molecules are investigated and represented
in Figure 13. Near
the equilibrium bond distance of the X3Π state in
the CdSe molecule, the TDM of the (1)1Π–(1)1Σ+ transition is much greater than that of
the other transition, but it decreases rapidly with the increase of
the bond length. The sudden variations and jumps that appear in the
TDMCs at different internuclear distances can be interpreted by (i)
the presence of the crossings and avoided crossings among the PECs
at these values of R, leading to a change in the
sign of the electronic wave functions and (ii) the strong interaction
between the ion-pair covalent states. It is well-observed that the
TDMCs vanish for large values of R, which is attributed
to the spin-forbidden transitions between two atomic orbitals at asymptotic
limits. For instance, the (1)3Σ+–X3Π transition tends to be zero at large values of R because of the spin-forbidden transition 3Pu–1Sg for the Cd atom. The significance
of the PDMs or TDMs rises owing to the implementation of polar molecules
in the area of ultracold molecular gases.34 The PDM and TDM curves are essential, as they are useful in designing
the photoassociation experiments for a molecule35 and in predicting transitions.

Figure 13 TDM between (1)3Σ+ and X3Π of the molecules
CdSe and CdTe.

Using the value μ21 of the TDM in the transition
between (1)3Σ+ and X3Π
at the equilibrium bond length Re of the
higher state, we calculated the wavelength λ21, the
emission angular frequency ω21, and the Einstein
coefficient of spontaneous emission A21 of the CdX molecules. As a result, the spontaneous radiative lifetime
τspon, the Einstein coefficient of induced emission B21ω, and the emission oscillator strength f21 are calculated by applying Hilborn’s equations.36 The calculated constants are shown in Table 3. Strong electronic
transitions are identified by A21 values
in the zone 108 to 109 s–1 and radiative lifetimes in the range 1–10 ns. The radiative
lifetimes of (1)3Σ+–X3Π transitions corresponding to the CdSe and CdTe molecules
are determined to be 18.9 and 7.09 μs, respectively. The Cd
atom is responsible for the (1)3Σ+–X3Π transition, as given in Table 1. In the NIST database,29 a transition between Cd (1S) and Cd (3P0) in the range 0–30656.087 cm–1 at a wavelength λ = 326.1 nm gives Aki = 4.06 × 105 s–1, fik = 0.00194, and τspon = 2.46
μs for a CdSe molecule as an illustration. The following comparison
reveals the reliability of our work.

The calculation of the ionicity of a molecule by qionicity = μ/eRe37 aids to recognize the nature of a molecular
bond where μ and Re are taken from
PECs and DMCs at the equilibrium positions. The ionicity value indicates
the amount of the ionic character relative to a molecular bond,38,39 where 0 ≤ qionicity ≤
1 with qionicity = 1 corresponds to the
extreme ionic character.40 We compute the
ionicity of the CdSe and CdTe molecules for the X3Π,
(1)1Σ+, (1)1Π, and (1)3Σ+ states at their equilibrium bond distance Re. The results are given in Table 4 where the calculated values
reveal the ionic and covalent nature of the bonding. At large values
of R, the dipole moment of the titled molecules tends
to zero because the molecule separates into its natural fragments.
Comparing our results with regard to the ionicity of identical electronic
states of CdX molecules, we conclude that the ionicity of these states
in the case of a CdSe molecule is higher, together with smaller values
of Re, recalling that Se is more electronegative
than Te.

Rovibrational calculation has been performed for the X3Π, (1)1Σ+, (1)1Π,
and (1)3Σ+ states of a CdSe molecule along
with the X3Π, (1)1Σ+,
and (1)1Π states of a CdTe molecule. Consequently,
the eigenvalue Ev, the
rotational constant Bv, the distortion constant Dv, and the abscissas of the turning points Rmin and Rmax have been computed
up to the vibrational level v = 20 via the canonical
functions approach41−45 along with the cubic spline interpolation among each two successive
points of the PECs. These values are given in Table 5 for the CdSe molecule and in Table 6 for the CdTe molecule. The
values presented in Table 5 are in good agreement with the data given in the literature.13

a For the present work with MRCI calculation.

4 Conclusions
Internally
contracted MRCI + Q calculations have been performed
on 25 and 26 molecular states of the CdSe and CdTe molecules, respectively.
The PECs and DMCs of the singlet, triplet, and quintet electronic
states of the CdX molecules are fitted along with the calculation
of the spectroscopic constants Re, ωe, Be, and Te for the bound states. According to our study, the 3Π state is classified as the ground state, and it dissociates
with the ground-state neutral atoms Cd(1S) and X(3P). Τhe PECs of the (1)1Σ+ and
(1)1Π states cross, as they have close energy levels.
The experimental inspection of the ground state and the first two
excited states is difficult by energy difference; however, the differences
in the spectroscopic parameters Re, ωe, and De between these states
can aid to identify them experimentally. The dissociation energies
of the ground-state 3Π of he CdSe and CdTe molecules
are 2705.28 and 2351.40 cm–1, respectively, and
it is very weakly bound. The ionicity has been reported for the X3Π, (1)1Σ+, (1)1Π, and (1)3Σ+ electronic states
of the CdX molecules, and it is found that the bond of these states
is of mixed nature. The (1)3Σ+–X3Π transition is studied and some of the transition parameters
are computed. The radiative lifetimes are of the order of microseconds.
The agreement between our results and the available data in the literature
is satisfactory.
