mRNA degradation is a key mechanism
of gene expression regulation.
In the 3′ → 5′ decay pathway, mRNA is degraded
by the exosome complex and the resulting cap dinucleotide or short-capped
oligonucleotide is hydrolyzed mainly by a decapping scavenger enzyme
(DcpS)—a member of the histidine triad family. The decapping
mechanism is similar for DcpS from different species; however, their
respective substrate specificities differ. In this paper, we describe
experiments exploring DcpS activity from human (hDcps), Caenorhabditis elegans (CeDcpS), and Ascaris suum (AsDcpS) toward dinucleotide cap analogues
modified at the N2 position of 7-methylguanosine. Various alkyl substituents
were tested, and cap analogues with a longer than three-carbon chain
were nonhydrolyzable by hDcpS and CeDcpS. Resistance of the modified
cap analogues to hDcpS and CeDcpS may be associated with their weaker
binding with enzymes.

Introduction
The 5′ ends of most RNAs are chemically
modified by cap
structures which play an important role in many cellular processes.
RNA caps facilitate pre-mRNA splicing and export to the cytoplasm,
promoting translation initiation and protecting the RNA from degradation
by nucleases.1,2 Several chemical modifications
have been described at RNA 5′ ends and all possess at least
one pyrophosphate bond.3 Eukaryotic mRNAs
have 5′-5′-linked N7-methyl guanosine (m7G) caps (m7G cap, MMG cap), and short nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)
and nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) possess a trimethylated version of the
cap (m32,2,7G cap, TMG cap). Hydrolysis of the
cap structure is a critical step in mRNA turnover.4,5 mRNA
decay is an essential process that allows cells to continuously modify
gene expression patterns in response to internal and environmental
changes. Decay pathways usually start with the removal of the poly(A)
tail from the 3′ end of the mRNA, and further degradation proceeds
either 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′ direction.5−8

In 5′ to 3′ decay, a cap pyrophosphate bond
is cleaved
by decapping enzymes, yielding m7GDP/m32,2,7GDP and the monophosphorylated RNA which is hydrolyzed
by exoribonuclease Xrn1.9 In eukaryotes,
three enzymes are known to decap mRNAs in vivo: Dcp2, Nudt16, and
Nudt3.7,8 These enzymes belong to the class of Nudix
phosphohydrolases that act on substrates of the general structure
nucleoside diphosphate linked to another moiety X.10,11 In the 3′ → 5′ decay pathway, mRNA is degraded
by a multisubunit exosome complex, and the resulting cap dinucleotide
or short-capped oligonucleotide is hydrolyzed by two decapping enzymes:
scavenger DcpS (Dcs1 in yeast) and Fhit (Hnt2/Aph1 in yeast).12,13 Both DcpS and Fhit are members of the histidine triad (HIT) family
of pyrophosphatases, with a conserved histidine triad (HxHxH) in the
active site. The HIT motif is utilized to bind substrates and cleave
the pyrophosphate bond within the cap, releasing m7GMP.14 For specific cap recognition by DcpS enzymes
and effective hydrolysis, a positive charge is required, introduced
by a substituent at the N7 position of the guanine moiety,15 as well as the triphosphate chain.12

The mechanism of the enzymatic cap cleavage
by decapping scavengers
is very similar among different species (human, nematode, and yeast),
but their substrate specificity differs significantly. All DcpS enzymes
are highly specific for dinucleotides and less active toward short
oligonucleotides; long mRNAs are not targeted.16−18 Human and yeast
enzymes accept cap analogues containing up to 10 nucleotides as substrates,
whereas nematode DcpS recognizes shorter species, capped di-, tri-,
and tetranucleotides. Human and yeast decapping scavengers are responsible
for degradation of monomethylated (at N7 position) cap analogues only,
while nematode enzymes exhibit hydrolytic activity toward mono- and
trimethylated cap structures.

We have previously determined
the DcpS–cap interactions
crucial for the catalytic activity of human and nematode decapping
scavengers.12,15,17 We tested the influence of some modifications of the cap structure
on the efficient binding and hydrolysis by DcpS. We found that modifications
of the phosphate chain and ribose moiety of m7G affect
the binding affinity and hydrolysis rate of cap analogues, whereas
the type of the second nucleoside and the size of substituent at N7
are less important. The role of the N2 substitution has not been examined
in detail.

Since the development of a procedure to chemically
synthesize cap
analogues modified within the N2 position of the purine ring,19 such analogues have become a powerful tool to
examine biological properties of cap binding proteins and for potential
medical applications. It has been recently shown that N2 substituted
analogues of 7-methylguanosine 5′-monophosphates represent
a promising class of effective translation inhibitors to counteract
elevated eIF4E levels in tumor cells. Such compounds possess an IC50 similar to m7GTP or m7GpppG despite
a reduced number of phosphate groups. This feature may support their
cell penetration.20 In addition, when incorporated
into mRNA, N2-modified ARCA (anti-reversed cap) analogues improved
its translational properties as well as enhancing mRNA stability in
HEK239 cells compared to the ARCA-capped transcript. The ARCA cap
is considered an excellent substrate to yield capped transcripts.21 Additionally, 7-methylguanosine cap analogues
possessing various substituents at the exocyclic 2-amino group appeared
to be a very sensitive and effective tool for the investigation of
the molecular mechanism of TMG-capped U snRNA recognition by snurportin
1, an adaptor protein crucial for the active nuclear import of this
class of RNA.22 For these reasons, experiments
enhancing our understanding of substrate specificity and hydrolytic
activity of decapping enzymes toward differently modified cap structures
are of great importance.

In the present work, we investigated
the influence of the N2 substitution
within the cap structure on the interaction with decapping scavengers
(DcpS) from different species (human, Caenorhabditis
elegans and Ascaris suum). We compared the hydrolysis rates of dinucleotide cap analogues
bearing various alkyl groups within an exocyclic amine group of 7-methylguanosine
and the binding affinity of some of hydrolysis products and nonhydrolyzable
analogues. Our results suggest that cap analogues possessing a longer
than three-carbon chain were nonhydrolyzable by hDcpS and CeDcpS.
Resistance of modified cap analogues to hDcpS and CeDcpS may be associated
with their weaker binding with enzymes.

Results and Discussion
In previous kinetic studies of cap cleavage by DcpS enzymes, we
compared the hydrolysis rate between m7GpppG and m32,2,7GpppG. The considerable difference between
the decapping activity of these proteins is the ability of C. elegans and A. suum DcpS to efficiently hydrolyze both MMG and TMG caps, in contrast,
the human enzyme is not responsible for TMG cleavage.17,23 The presence of two methyl groups at the N2 position of 7-methylguanosine
is a key determinant of differential specificities of human and nematode
decapping scavengers.

To further investigate the effect of N2
substitution on cap recognition
and hydrolysis by DcpS, we examined several dinucleotide cap analogues
with different alkyl groups introduced at the N2 position. N2-modified
dinucleotide cap analogues synthesized for DcpS activity studies included
compounds containing in the N2 position of 7-methylgunosine: methyl
(m2m7GpppG), ethyl (et2m7GpppG), propyl (prop2m7GpppG), isopropyl (iprop2m7GpppG), butyl (but2m7GpppG),
and isobutyl (ibut2m7GpppG) substituents (Figure 1). All compounds
were obtained and characterized as described previously.19,22

Figure 1 Synthesized
dinucleotide cap analogues having modifications at
the N2 position of 7-methylguanosine.

The hydrolysis process of each compound was studied with human, C. elegans and A. suum DcpS in the same experimental conditions (20 °C, 50 mM phosphate
buffer pH 7.2 containing 150 mM NaCl). Reaction progress was monitored
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The comparison of
hydrolysis rate is presented in Figures 2 and Table 1.

All experiments were performed at 20 °C, in 50 mM phosphate buffer
pH 7.2 containing 150 mM NaCl. Initial concentration of cap analogues
was 20 μM. Enzyme concentration was 0.04 μM in experiments
with hDcpS and 0.01 μM in experiments with both nematode DcpS.

a Experiments were
performed at 20
°C, in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2, containing 150 mM NaCl.
Initial concentration of cap analogues was 20 μM. Reactions
were initiated by the addition of 2 μL of DcpS enzyme to 1 mL
of reaction mixture. The V0 values were
calculated as averages of three independent experiments.

b Not hydrolyzed.

Our analysis indicates some differences in substrate
specificity
of the three enzymes. Human and C. elegans DcpS exhibit higher specificity than the A. suum enzyme, as they only efficiently hydrolyze cap analogues with a
small substituent at the N2 position (methyl or ethyl group). The
rate of hydrolysis catalyzed by human DcpS is 2–3 times lower
in comparison with m7GpppG. In the case of C. elegans DcpS, m2m7GpppG
and et2m7GpppG are hydrolyzed more efficiently
than m7GpppG. Prop2m7GpppG is a poor
substrate for human and C. elegans DcpS;
it is hydrolyzed only by C. elegans DcpS but very slowly. The reaction with human DcpS occurs when the
enzyme concentration increases 1 order of magnitude in comparison
with m7GpppG. Dinucleotides containing larger substituents
at the N2 position (isopropyl, butyl, and isobutyl) are resistant
to enzymatic digestion by human and C. elegans DcpS. In contrast to these two enzymes, A. suum DcpS accepts all investigated dinucleotides as substrates. They
are hydrolyzed with a comparable rate except et2m7GpppG, which is cleaved very rapidly.

Our kinetic data indicate
that the size of the substituent introduced at the N2 position strongly
influences the rate of hydrolysis catalyzed by human and C. elegans DcpS. For nonhydrolyzable but2m7GpppG, binding affinity studies with both enzymes were
performed (Figure 3). As presented in Table 2, the association constants (Kas) and Gibbs free energies (ΔG0)
of but2m7GpppG binding with human and C. elegans DcpS are very similar. The Kas values (5.11 ± 0.71 and 5.78
± 0.64 μM–1) are 1 order of magnitude
smaller than Kas determined previously
for dinucleotides nonmodified at the N2 position.12,23 Such weak interactions of but2m7GpppG with
human and C. elegans DcpS may explain
its resistance to hydrolysis catalyzed by both enzymes.

above 1 μM corresponds to the fluorescence of unbound compounds.

We also compared the binding affinity of m2m7GMP for human and C. elegans decapping
scavenger. We found that C. elegans DcpS have similar Kas values for m2m7GMP (7.36 ± 1.56 μM–1) (Table 2) and m7GMP (8.00 ± 1.56 μM–1),23 whereas human DcpS exhibits 6-fold lower affinity
for m2m7GMP (3.5 ± 0.7 μM–1) (Table 2) compared
to m7GMP (19 ± 1 μM1).23 The decreasing affinity of human DcpS for cap
analogue-containing substituent at the N2 position affects the rate
of hydrolysis.

Our results reveal different activity of human
and nematode DcpS
depending on the type of the alkyl group introduced at the N2 position.
For human DcpS, m7GpppG is the best substrate. Dinucleotides
bearing the methyl or ethyl group at the N2 position were also hydrolyzed
by this enzyme but less efficiently. In contrast, hydrolytic activity
of C. elegans DcpS is higher toward
m2m7GpppG and et2m7GpppG
than for m7GpppG. Prop2m7GpppG is
a very poor substrate for human and C. elegans DcpS, and dinucleotides with butyl, isopropyl or isobutyl group
at the N2 position are resistant to cleavage by both enzymes. A. suum DcpS accepts as substrates all investigated
dinucleotides, hydrolyzing them with a comparable rate. These results
indicate that the region within the cap-binding pocket of A. suum DcpS, which is involved in the interaction
with N2 position, is more flexible in comparison with human and C. elegans DcpS. This flexibility may explain why A. suum DcpS can accommodate cap dinucleotides with
significantly large alkyl groups at the N2 position (such as propyl,
isopropyl, butyl, and isobutyl) and hydrolyze them with a similar
rate as m7GpppG.

Some other types of cap modifications
have been tested previously
to determine their influence on binding affinity for DcpS and susceptibility
to DcpS-mediated hydrolysis. It was shown that modifications within
the triphosphate chain as well as at the 2′-O- or 3′-O-position
of m7G ribose affect the binding affinity for decapping
scavengers and protect it from enzymatic cleavage.12 A distinct effect was observed when various substituents
were introduced at the N7 position. Dinucleotide cap analogues bearing
differently sized groups at this position (methyl, ethyl, butyl, and
benzyl) were hydrolyzed with a comparable rate by the human DcpS.15 In the case of nematode DcpS, cap analogues
substituted by ethyl, butyl, or benzyl were hydrolyzed more efficiently
than m7GpppG.15

In summary,
we conclude that the human DcpS enzyme exhibits the
highest substrate specificity. Substitution of different positions
within m7G generally decreases the hydrolytic susceptibility
of dinucleotides. C. elegans DcpS accepts
different modifications at the N7 position but only small substituent
at N2. A. suum DcpS exhibits the hydrolytic
activity toward dinucleotide cap analogues with various modifications
at the N7 or N2 position.

Experimental Section
Cap Analogue Synthesis
N2-substituted cap analogues
investigated in this work (x2m7GpppG) were synthesized
and characterized as described in detail earlier.19,22

The concentrations of all compounds were determined on the
basis of their absorption coefficients.

DcpS Production and Purification
Human or C. elegans DcpS was expressed
from the respective
pET vectors in the Rosetta 2(DE3) Escherichia coli strain. Protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG when OD600 reached 0.5–0.8, and then, cells were further incubated
at 18 °C overnight. After expression, the bacterial pellet was
collected by centrifugation (7000g, 10 min) and was
frozen at −80 °C. The frozen pellet was thawed on ice
and then resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer: 50 mM phosphate buffer
pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM imidazole. Suspension
was sonicated and then centrifuged for 2 h. The supernatant was loaded
on the HisTrapHP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). All separation
by affinity chromatography was done with a gradient of imidazole 20–600
mM in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2. The DcpS protein was further
purified and buffer exchanged: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol
pH 7.5, by gel filtration (“Superdex 200 10/300GL” GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) using an ÄKTA protein purification
system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and stored in −80 °C. A. suum DcpS was prepared according to the procedure
described previously.23

Decapping Assays
The hydrolytic susceptibility of dinucleotide
cap analogues was examined in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2 containing
150 mM NaCl. Before each experiment, 2 mL of buffer solution containing
the investigated compound was incubated at 20 °C for 10 min.
The hydrolysis process was initiated by the addition of recombinant
DcpS. To control the hydrolysis progress, 400 μL aliquots of
the reaction mixture were withdrawn at different time intervals and
incubated at 97 °C during 5 min to stop the reaction by heat
inactivation of the enzyme. The samples were then subjected to analytical
HPLC.

Analysis of Hydrolytic Stability of Cap Analogues
Analysis
of hydrolysis products were done by the HPLC system (Agilent 1200
series) equipped with a reverse-phase Supelcosil LC-18-T column and
UV–vis detector. Experiments were performed at 20 °C with
a linear gradient of methanol in 0.1 M KH2PO4 (from 0 to 25% or from 0 to 40%) over 15 min at a flow rate of 1.0
mL/min. The changes of absorbance at 260 nm were monitored continuously
during analysis.

Fluorescence Titration Analysis of Binding
Affinity
DcpS-cap binding affinity was determined by monitoring
the quenching
of intrinsic DcpS Trp fluorescence. The experiments were performed
on the LS-50B spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Co, Waltham, MA) in
a quartz cuvette with an optical length of 4 mm for absorption and
10 mm for emission. All measurements were done at 20 °C, in 50
mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2 containing 150 mM NaCl. 1 μL aliquots
of cap analogue solution of increasing concentration (from 2 μM
to 2 mM) were added to 1.4 mL of DcpS solution (0.2 μM). The
fluorescence intensity was monitored at 340 nm and corrected for sample
dilution and inner filter effects. The equilibrium association constants
for single titration curves were determined by fitting the theoretical
dependence of the fluorescence intensity to the experimental data
points. The final Kas values were calculated
as weighted averages of three independent titrations. The numerical
least-squares nonlinear regression analysis was performed using ORIGIN
8.0 (Microcal Software, Inc.).
