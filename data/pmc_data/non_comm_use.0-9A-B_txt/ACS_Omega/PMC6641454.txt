This research aims to develop self-standing
nitrogen-doped carbon
fiber networks from plant protein–lignin electrospun fibrous
mats for supercapacitors. The challenge in preparing carbon fiber
from protein is to maintain a fibrous structure during carbonization
process. Thus, lignin was incorporated with protein. At protein-to-lignin
ratio of 50:50 to 20:80, the electrospun fibers maintained their structure
after carbonization and formed self-standing carbon fiber mats. Stacked
graphene layer structure was developed in the carbon fibers at a relatively
low carbonization temperature (<1000 °C) without the use of
catalysts, which might be derived from both lignin and protein. Graphene
layer structure conferred the carbon fibers with superior conductivity.
The optimized carbon fiber networks possessed excellent capacitance
performance in 6 M KOH of 410 F/g at 1 A/g and good cyclic stability.
Such good electrochemical properties were due to the well-engineered
characteristics of the materials, including a hierarchical porous
texture, heteroatoms (nitrogen and oxygen), and the stacked graphene
layer structure. This research not only has provided a convenient
way to develop carbon fibers from plant protein−lignin for
N-doped supercapacitor electrodes, but also opportunity to add value
to plant proteins and lignin as by-products of agricultural industry
processing.

Introduction
Supercapacitors have
attracted extensive attention in recent years
because of their high power densities, rapid charging time, and long
cyclic stability.1 They show promise to
meet the increasing power demand for energy storage systems in various
applications.2 Supercapacitors can be classified
into two categories: electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and
pseudocapacitors.3 EDLCs are based on the
adsorption of electrolyte ions on the surface area of conductive materials,
which are favorable in commercial utilization currently because of
their superior cycle stability.

Carbon materials are widely
used to produce EDLCs because of their
good electrical conductivity and relatively low cost. The capacitance
of EDLCs is related to the specific area of the electrodes. Activated
carbon fibers have attracted interest because of their ability to
build up hierarchical porous structures, namely, macropores in combination
with meso- and micropores, with a large length/diameter ratio, surface
area, and pore volume.4 They not only provide
large surface area to store energy but also possess a shortened ion
transport time.5 Currently, template casting,
solvothermal synthesis, and chemical vapor deposition methods are
applied to prepare carbon fiber precursors. However, these methods
have limitations such as material restrictions, high cost, and process
complexity.6 Electrospinning is a relatively
convenient method to directly fabricate fiber networks, where the
electrospun fiber composition, diameter, and alignment can be modulated
to achieve a desirable structure and performance.7

Incorporating heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen
into the
carbon framework is an effective strategy to improve the EDLC performance.
N-doping has been shown to induce pseudocapacitance to carbon materials
by additional faradaic redox reaction and/or chemisorption.8−10 N-rich biomaterials, such as protein and chitosan,11 are environmentally friendly precursors to prepare N-doped
carbon materials.12,13 Proteins, rich in N and O, are
one of the most abundant biomaterials on earth. Previous reports showed
that the carbon samples derived from biomass rich in proteins, such
as albumin,14 hair,1 silk cocoon,4 gelatin,15 and chicken eggshell membranes,16 possess high capacitance of more than 200 F/g. However, to the best
of our knowledge, protein-based carbon fibers with a hierarchical
porous structure have not been reported as a supercapacitor material.

Zein and hordein are the major alcohol-soluble storage proteins
(prolamins) in corn and barley, respectively. Zein is the byproduct
of corn starch processing and the major coproduct of bioethanol production.17 Hordein is largely available as the byproduct
of starch and β-glucan extraction.18 Development of value-added products from zein and hordein would
benefit cereal growers and processors as well as reduce the wastes.
Nanofiber fabrics based on the mixture of zein and hordein have been
developed by our previous work via electrospinning.19−21 Such fabrics
contain a large amount of N in the polypeptide chains and show good
tensile strength, controllable diameter, and continuous fiber network.19−21 These are important attributes to create hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped
carbon fibers with superior capacitive performance.

The challenge
in developing energy storage materials from electrospun
zein/hordein protein nanofiber fabrics is to maintain a fibrous mat
structure because of the thermoplastic nature of proteins. To overcome
this challenge, lignin is incorporated with plant protein. Lignin,
one of the most important renewable resources on earth, contains abundant
aromatic components, which allows it to be a good carbon precursor.22 Under proper heating conditions, lignin would
aid in the development of a hierarchical porous structure.23 However, lignin is challenging to be electrospun
in many cases because of its susceptibility to “beading”
resulting from the low molecular weight and low viscosity of lignin
in solution.24 In this study, for the first
time, lignin will be incorporated with plant protein in acetic acid
aqueous solution to prepare electrospun fibers. The effects of protein–lignin
ratio on carbon fiber morphology and electrochemical performance were
evaluated. The potential and mechanism of proteins forming a graphitic
structure were preliminarily investigated in this study. The electrochemical
performance of the carbon fiber network was also tested.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
of Protein–Lignin Electrospun Fibers and the
Derived Carbon Fiber Mats
It was challenging to maintain
the protein fiber networks during the carbonization process up to
900 °C because proteins are thermoplastic materials and often
melt and lose their original structure at carbonization temperatures.
The amorphous regions of protein molecules become mobile above the
glass-transition temperatures (139 and 125 °C for zein and hordein,
respectively). Crystalline regions then melt above the melting temperature
before decomposition at even higher temperatures.25 To overcome this problem, lignin was added to sustain the
fiber structure because it can transform from a thermoplastic to a
thermosetting type during a continuous heating process.26 Continuous fibers with smooth surfaces and uniform
diameters were successfully prepared for the first time from a plant
protein–lignin mixture formula without the Figure 1. The lignin suspension alone
showed poor electrospinning properties because lignin molecules have
insufficient chain structure, intermolecular interactions, and/or
entanglements.22 Thus, the formation of
continuous electrospun fibers was attributed to the good electrospinnability
of hordein and zein.21 Previous experiments
by Wang and Chen21 showed that the hordein/zein
mixture at a ratio of 1:1 exhibited a stable assembled network structure
with good tensile strength. Thus, this hordein/zein ratio was used
in the preparation of protein–lignin electrospun fibers. Comparing
protein–lignin fibers with those from protein alone, the increase
of lignin content from 0 to 50% increased the diameter of the fibers
from 0.54 ± 0.153 to 2.61 ± 7.2 μm. When the lignin
ratio increased to 50%, the viscosity of the mixture increased (data
not shown). The increased viscosity may be related to the interaction
between lignin and proteins via hydrogen bonding.27 It was reported that increased viscosity contributed to
the larger fiber diameter because higher cohesiveness of the electrospun
dopes requires more force to elongate the fibers.28 However, when the lignin content increased from 50 to 80%,
the diameter of the fibers decreased to 0.85 ± 0.24 μm.
The addition of lignin to 80% significantly affected the protein’s
electrospinnability. The interruption of protein interactions
resulted in a lower viscosity, leading to a smaller fiber diameter.28

Carbon fiber samples with different
protein–lignin ratios
showed significantly different morphologies (Figure 2A,C,E). A balanced protein–lignin
ratio strongly influenced the compatibility of these two biopolymers
to determine the structures of the carbon products. Samples of 100%
protein melted during heating, and no fiber structure was formed (Figure S1). The fibrous structure of L2P8 was
partially lost after carbonization. The broken fiber network made
L2P8-900 sample loss its self-standing property. L5P5-900 samples
showed a continuous and smooth fiber structure after carbonization,
and the fiber network was maintained. This was likely due to the good
compatibility between protein and lignin at such a ratio, allowing
both of them to be homogenously distributed within the fiber network.27 As shown in the inserted image of Figure 2C, the carbon fiber mat of
L5P5-900 was self-standing and flexible, having potential to be used
in pliable supercapacitors with many applications, such as portable
personal electronics. When the protein-to-lignin ratio decreased to
20:80 (L8P2), the electrospun fibers also maintained their structure
after carbonization and the carbon fiber mat was self-standing.

photograph inserted in (C) demonstrates the flexibility of L5P5-900.

Chemical Features
Hordein and zein contain about 16%
(w/w) nitrogen. Thus, the plant protein–lignin electrospun
fiber is a nitrogen-rich carbon fiber precursor. In the L5P5 fiber,
the nitrogen and carbon contents were 7.0 and 56.7% (w/w), respectively.
Carbon materials doped with heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, are expected
to have an enhanced surface wettability, electronic conductivity,
and capacitance.8 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was conducted to evaluate the chemical composition
of the developed carbon fibers. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 1, nitrogen and oxygen were still maintained in the
carbon networks after carbonization. Specifically, C 1s, O 1s, and
N 1s were the three major peaks in the XPS spectra of L2P8-900, L5P5-900,
and L8P2-900 (Figure 3A). The N content was increased as the protein ratio increased. For
the L5P5-900 sample, 20.1% of the nitrogen in protein–lignin
fibers was reserved even after the carbonization and activation processes.

The nitrogen functional groups were
further investigated after
deconvolution of the N 1s spectrum. As demonstrated in Table 1 and Figure S3, four overlapped peaks centered at 398.4, 399.9, 400.6,
and 401.5 eV were observed and assigned to N-6 (pyridinic N), N-5
(pyrrolic N and/or pyridonic N), N-Q (quaternary N), and N-X (oxidized
N), respectively.29,30 N-5 was the major N functional
group of all three samples. L2P8-900, L5P5-900, and L8P2-900 contained
55, 37, and 49% N-5, respectively. N-6, N-5, and N-X were considered
as the nitrogen groups located at the edge of graphene layers.31 N-Q represents nitrogen bonded to three carbon
atoms and was more likely to be found in the central position of graphene
sheets.32 Plentiful edge N groups were
reported to be more active in contributing to the electrochemical
performance. Pyridinic (N-6) and pyrrolic N (N-5) were assumed to
be the main configurations introducing pseudocapacitance to the carbon
materials, whereas N-Q was beneficial to the conductivities of carbon
materials.33 The higher protein ratio resulted
in higher amount of edge N groups. The edge N groups accounted for
80.4, 75.6, and 71.2% of total N functional groups in L2P8-900, L5P5-900,
and L8P2-900, respectively. This result revealed that the higher the
protein–lignin ratio, the more the edge N groups in the final
carbon sample. A protein consists of at least one linear long chain
of amino acid residues linked by peptide bonds and folded into 3D
conformation. Before carbonization, hordein and zein are both high
in proline residue (21% in hordein and 10% in zein), which has a pyrrolidine
side chain, and glutamine residue, which has an amine group in the
side chain.34,35 Other N atoms are in the form
of the secondary amine groups in the peptide bonds. These results
indicated that for higher plant protein–lignin ratio samples,
amine groups were more likely to be converted into pyrrolic N, pyridinic
N, and oxidized N located at the edge of the graphene layers during
carbonization. L2P8-900, L5P5-900, and L8P2-900 were also high in
oxygen, with 8.9, 5.7, and 4.3% oxygen, respectively. The spectra
of C 1s (Figure S2) showed the existence
of C–O, C–OH, and O=C–OH.

It was
interesting that the carbon fiber was composed of a stacked
graphitic layer structure, as demonstrated in the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images (Figure 3B–D). The graphitic
layers stacked and folded together with the layer-to-layer distance
(d-spacing) among sheets being around 0.38 nm, similar
to the spacing of the (002) distance of the graphitic carbon lattice
(0.34 nm).36 Because of the intrinsic properties
of graphene, these graphitic layers could improve the electrode performance
by speeding up the transport of electrons and by increasing the in-plane
conductivity.37 The graphitic structure
was also confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy.

XRD in the wide-angle region was used to evaluate the structure
arrangement of the carbon samples (Figure 3E). The XRD patterns of three carbon samples
derived from plant protein–lignin electrospun fibers were similar,
having two peaks at around 23 and 44°. The wide and broad peak
at 23° (002 lattice plane) indicated the existence of layer-by-layer
graphitic stacking,38,39 further confirming the stacked
graphitic layer structure observed by HR-TEM. The d002 (an interlayer spacing of 002 plane) can be calculated
by the following equation: d002 = λ/(2
sin θ002), where λ is the wavelength of X-ray
used. Thus, d002 of L5P5-900 was 0.387
nm, which was greater than but rather close to that of the pristine
graphite of 0.34 nm.36 The increase of d-spacing was possibly caused by the presence of oxygen
and nitrogen functional groups.38 The insertion
of O and/or N caused changes in the reacting carbon atoms. The out
of planar C–N or C–O covalent bonds resulted in the
atomic scale roughness and thus increased the distance between graphene
layers.40,41 Furthermore, the peak at 44° corresponded
to the graphitic (100) crystal plane.42

Raman spectroscopy was employed to reveal the quality of graphitic
structure of carbon samples. As shown in Figure 3F, two major bands appeared in the 500–2500
cm–1 region, including the D band at 1344 cm–1 and the G band at 1595 cm–1. The
intensity of the D band is related to the vibration of C atoms with
dangling bonds in planar terminations of defective and/or disordered
graphite. The G band, on the other hand, is an indicator of the 2D
graphite, corresponding to the vibration of sp2 C in a
2D hexagonal lattice.43 Thus, the ratio
of G/D band intensities (IG/ID) illustrates the crystalline degree of carbon materials. IG/ID values of L2P8-900,
L5P5-900, and L8P2-900 were 1.00, 1.01, and 1.01, respectively, indicating
the existence of graphite structure in carbon samples derived from
protein–lignin electrospun fibers, albeit with disorder. The
high protein ratio resulted in a slightly higher amount of defective
structure. The IG/ID values of these carbon samples were less than those of the
pristine natural graphite, which can be attributed to the introduction
of oxygen and nitrogen functional groups into the carbon network.23,44 The relatively high graphitization degree may offer good electric
conductivity, which was consistent with HR-TEM and XRD results.

Traditionally, the production of graphene materials has been challenging,
including the high production cost and the demand for high energy
input and the corrosive reagents, which limited their application
as a commercial material for supercapacitors.45,46 This study demonstrated that a porous graphitic layer stacked structure
can be created at a lower temperature (<1000 °C) without the
use of a catalyst. The carbon precursor and the carbonization conditions
both determine the structure of the final carbon material.2 The addition of lignin can transform the product
from amorphous carbon to nanocrystalline graphite because it permits
nucleation, growth, and clustering of aromatic rings during pyrolysis
from 600 to 1000 °C.47 On the other
hand, proteins may have the potential to form a stacked graphitic
layer structure.15,48 As shown by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) (Figure S3A), the decomposition
of the protein electrospun fibers began at around 200 °C, above
the glass-transition temperatures of hordein and zein. At this temperature,
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure S3B) showed that the protein denatured and its secondary
structure dramatically changed. The amide I band (1700–1600
cm–1) in the FTIR spectra is the prominent vibrational
band of the protein backbone and is correlated with protein secondary
structures.49 Protein electrospun fibers
possessed one major peak at 1652 cm–1, which was
assigned to α-helix. After heating to 200 °C for 2 h, α-helix
decreased, whereas β-sheets structure increased, as indicated
by rising peaks at 1692, 1683, and 1623 cm–1.50,51 The β-sheets are considered as crystal-dominant lamellar structures
because they consist of polypeptide backbones connected and organized
into pleated sheets by inter-/intramolecular hydrogen bonds. β-Sheets
can transform into aligned hexagonal polyaromatic structure with
pseudographitic crystalline lattice through cyclization or aromatization
by intermolecular dehydration or condensation between adjacent polypeptide
chains.48,52,53 Thus, it is
possible that hordein and zein formed the stacked graphitic layers
based on their β-sheet secondary structure during carbonization.
However, the synergistic effects of protein and lignin need to be
investigated further to better understand the formation mechanism
of these graphitic layers.

Porous Texture
Methods to increase
the specific surface
area of carbon materials include chemical activation (using NaOH,
KOH, ZnCl, phosphoric acid, etc.) and physical activation (heating
under steam, air, carbon dioxide, etc.).2 Heating under CO2 gas flow is an efficient treatment
to increase the pore volume and surface area as well as to control
the pore size distribution and surface chemistry of carbon materials
by partial gasification of the carbon surface.54,55 As compared to chemical activation methods, no post-treatments are
required after CO2 activation, which makes it an environment-friendly
activation method. To further improve the structure and properties
of plant protein–lignin-based carbon fibers, they were pyrolyzed
at 850 °C for 3 h under a CO2 atmosphere. Figure 2B,D,F demonstrates
the pores on the fiber surface.

As shown in Figure 2C,E, the L5P5-900 and L8P2-900
samples maintained their continuous and interconnected fiber network
after carbonization and activation. The interconnected large macropores
formed by fiber interlacement could facilitate the ion transportation
by serving as ion-buffering reservoirs and providing a low resistance
for ion transportation from bulk electrolyte solution into carbon
inner porous structures.56,57 This could subsequently
contribute to the high rate capability and high power density of carbon
materials.57 Under higher magnification
(Figure 2D,F), the
carbon fiber surface was porous and composed of a large number of
meso- or micropores, likely formed during the CO2 activation
step.58 These numerous open pores can not
only greatly increase the surface area but also improve the electrolyte
ion accessibility by providing larger transport pores for diffusion
from the surface to inner porous structures.2

Figure 3G shows
the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of carbon samples.
As shown in Table 1, the total specific surface areas of L2P8-900, L5P5-900, and L8P2-900
were calculated to be 561, 758, and 1113 m2/g, respectively.
The surface areas of L5P5-900 and L8P2-900 were higher than those
of other carbon fibers reported in the literature.4,23,59,60 The specific
surface area of electrospun nanofibers was strongly depended on the
diameter of fibers. The specific surface area of the nanofibrous membrane
can be enhanced by reducing the diameter of fibers.61,62 As compared to L5P5-900 and L8P2-900, the relatively low surface
area of L2P8-900 was due to the collapse of the fibrous structure
after carbonization. The diameter of L8P2-900 fibers was smaller than
that of L5P5-900, resulted in a higher surface area and external surface
area. The average pore sizes of these three carbon samples were around
1.3–1.4 nm. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms
of the three samples had a similar pattern. The adsorption behavior
of nitrogen on carbon sample surface showed an initial large uptake
in the low-pressure region (P/P0 < 0.1), followed by a gradual increase in the mid P/P0 region and then a slight
increase in the high-pressure region (P/P0 > 0.9). The carbon samples, especially L5P5-900 and
L8P2-900, had high nitrogen adsorption at very low relative pressure
(P/P0 < 0.1), which
was a typical indicator of the existence of a large amount of micropores.1 The isotherm continuously increased until a high P/P0 value and did not saturate
even at P/P0 of about
1, which meant that this carbon material consisted of abundant mesopores
and/or macropores.4 The hysteresis loop
of nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm is associated with
the capillary condensation of nitrogen in the pores; thus, the shape
of the hysteresis loop is usually used to exhibit the specific porous
structures.63,64 Because the adsorption and desorption
branches were approximately parallel to each other over an appreciable
range of P/P0, the hysteresis
loop could be classified as type H4, which was known to be related
to the narrow slit-like pores.63 The hysteresis
loop was observed from P/P0 of about 0.1–0.95, which proved the coexistence of microporous,
mesoporous, and macroporous structures in the carbon fiber mats.59

Electrochemical Performance
The
structure and chemical
feature of carbon materials derived from protein–lignin electrospun
fabrics triggered our interest to further investigate their electrochemical
performance. Thus, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge
profile, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used
to test the feasibility of carbon fibers as a supercapacitor electrode
material using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte.

Figure 4A exhibits the CV curves of
L2P8-900, L5P5-900, and L8P2-900 at a scan rate of 25 mV/s. The CV
curves displayed a relatively good rectangular shape, indicating a
typical characteristic of double-layer capacitance. As shown in Figure S4, the CV curve of L5P5-900 without activation
exhibited a triangle shape, which demonstrated the existence of pronounced
ion sieving effect. In such a case, the microrange pores were too
small and excluded out the electrolyte ions during scanning. The CV
curve of L5P5-900 was turned into rectangular after activation, demonstrating
a good capacitive behaviour. This showed that CO2 activation
opened up pores that were closed, clogged, or obstructed and created
meso- and macropores at the surface of the carbon fibers. As shown
in Table 1, the major
pore radii of carbon samples were around 1.3–1.4 nm, which
were larger than that generally required for the accommodation of
aqueous electrolytes (0.4–0.8 nm).65,66 L2P8-900 had a smaller capacitance as compared to L5P5-900 and L8P2-900,
which was caused by its smaller specific surface area. Moreover, L5P5-900
and L8P2-900 can be used for freestanding and binder-free electrodes. Figure 4B shows that the
current density continuously increased as a function of scan rate
for L8P2-900. The CV curve still maintained a quasi-rectangular shape
even at scan rate as high as 50 mV/s, exhibiting excellent ion transport
behavior and rapid charge propagation capability. This favorable characteristic
was likely to be related to its hierarchic porous structure and partial
graphitization. The interconnected porous structure provided a rapid
ion transport pathway.57 The stacked graphitic
layer structure endowed the carbon fibers with high electron mobility
because of its zero-gap semiconductor nature.67 The CV curves of L5P5-900 (Figure S5A) showed a similar quasi-rectangular shape even at scan rates as
high as 100 mV/s.

The reversible capacitive behaviors of plant protein–lignin-based
carbon fibrous samples were confirmed by the symmetrical triangle
shape of the charge–discharge curve. The charge–discharge
curves of L8P2-900 at different current densities via a three-electrode
system are showed in Figure 4C. The charge–discharge curves of L5P5-900 are shown
in Figure S5B. The specific capacitances
of L8P2-900 and L5P5-900 were about 410 and 360 F/g at a current density
of 1 A/g, respectively. Those are among the best gravity specific
capacitance for carbon material supercapacitors.39,64,68 The areal specific capacitances of L8P2-900
and L5P5-900 were 36.85 and 47.48 μF/cm2 at a current
density of 1 A/g, respectively, which surpassed the area-normalized
specific capacitances of active carbon (10–20 μF/cm2) and many carbon materials reported recently, such as N-doped
hollow carbon nanofibers with an areal specific capacitance of 28.1
μF/cm2 at 0.2 A/g and carbon nanofibers from lignin
with 11 μF/cm2 at 0.4 A/g.4,69−71 Though L2P8-900 had a relatively low gravity specific
capacitance of 254 F/g, its areal specific capacitance was 45.31 μF/cm2 at 1 A/g, which demonstrated the contribution of pseudocapacitance
from N and O functional groups. The edge N groups were reported to
provide significant pseudocapacitance to the carbon surface.33 L5P5-900 and L8P2-900 had more than 200 F/g
even at a high current density of 10 A/g. The freestanding ability
and high specific capacitance of L5P5-900 and L8P2-900 allowed them
to be favorable for large-scale applications, such as highly compact
electric power source.

EIS is a powerful technique for characterizing
the properties of
electrode–electrolyte interfaces of supercapacitors and provides
information about the internal resistance of the electrode materials
and the resistance between electrode and electrolyte.59 The Nyquist plots of L8P2-900 are shown in Figure 4E. In the low-frequency region,
a straight vertical line was obtained, indicating a near-ideal capacitive
behavior of the L8P2-900 carbon sample. The projected length of the
Warburg-type line (the slope of the 45° portion of the Nyquist
plots) on the Z′ axis was widely accepted
to demonstrate the characterization of ion diffusion process in the
electrode. The knee frequency of L8P2-900 was 40 Hz. The onset frequency,
defined as the highest frequency where the impedance of electrode
begins to be dominated by the capacitive behavior, was 25 Hz for L8P2-900.16 The Warburg-type line of L8P2-900 was rather
short, directly proving that the carbon material had a short electrolyte
diffusion pathway because of its hierarchical porous structure, which
is important for a low ion transport resistance and high rate capability
and power density.57 A resistance of 2.76
Ω obtained by extrapolating the vertical portion of the plot
to the real axis confirmed a low equivalent series resistance value
of the L8P2-900 electrode system.

As exhibited in Figure 4F, 95% of the initial capacitance
of L8P2-900 was maintained
after over 3000 charge and discharge cycles at a current density of
5 A/g. The long-term stability of L5P5-900 is shown in Figure S5D. This result indicated that L8P2-900
and L5P5-900 carbon materials had excellent long-term charge–discharge
cyclic stability, which would make them feasible for use in many industrial
and personal applications.

Conclusions
This
is the first time that a convenient method has been developed
to prepare nitrogen-doped and self-standing carbon fibers from plant
proteins and lignin with a high energy storage capacity. Carbon fiber
mat L8P2-900 possessed a specific capacitance of 410 F/g and 35.8
μF/cm2 in 6 M KOH and 95% capacitance retention after
3000 charge–discharge cycles. These excellent electrochemical
properties were due to the well-engineered characteristics of the
materials, including a hierarchical porous texture, an interconnected
fiber network, a large amount of heteroatoms (nitrogen and oxygen),
and the stacked graphene layer structure. Carbon fibers derived from
plant protein–lignin electrospun fibers have the potential
to be used as new and effective energy storage devices. Environmentally
sustainable industrial applications could be developed from this technology,
such as portable electronic devices, hybrid electric vehicles, and
the management of large-scale power systems.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Barley grains (Falcon) were provided by Dr.
James Helm, Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development, Lacombe, AB,
Canada. Hordeins were extracted from barley grains using an ethanol
solution according to a previous work.35 Zein (F4000, 92% protein content) was provided by Freeman Industries
LLC (New York, NY, USA) and used without further purification. Alkali
lignin, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, molecular weight ∼275 000
by gel permeation chromatography), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP), potassium hydroxide, and acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Canada Ltd (Oakville, ON, Canada). Dimethylformamide (DMF) and carbon
black super P were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, ON, Canada)
and Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, US), respectively. All chemicals were
used as received unless otherwise specified.

Preparation of Plant Protein–Lignin
Electrospun Fibers
Lignin and plant protein (hordein/zein
= 50/50, w/w) powders were
dissolved in a mixed solution of acetic acid and DMF (90/10, v/v)
and stirred for 12 h. The total content of polymers was 36% (w/v).
The lignin and protein blending ratios were 20/80, 50/50, and 80/20
(w/w). Correspondingly, their electrospun fiber samples were coded
as L2P8, L5P5 and L8P2, respectively. The electrospinning experiments
were carried out on a customized digital electrospinning apparatus
EC-DIG (IME Technologies, Eindhoven, Netherlands) at 25 °C. Solutions
were forced through a blunt needle with a diameter of 0.8 mm at a
flow rate of 1 mL/h. The spinning voltage was fixed at 20 kV, and
the needle-to-collector distance was 20 cm. The electrospun fiber
fabrics were collected on a collector with a rotating speed of 1 rpm.

Carbonization and Activation
The carbon fibers were
synthesized by carbonizing the protein and lignin electrospun fiber
mat in a tubular furnace (GSL-1100X-NT-UL, MTI Corporation, Richmond,
CA, US), followed by a carbon dioxide activation step. In a typical
experiment, protein–lignin nanofiber mats underwent the following
heating procedure under continuous purge of air to stabilize their
structure: (1) temperature raised from 25 to 200 °C at a rate
of 1 °C/min; (2) from 200 to 250 °C at 0.5 °C/min;
(3) stabilized at 250 °C for 3 h; and (4) sample cooled down
naturally under air flow. Then, the carbonization step was performed
under continuous purge of protection gas (argon/hydrogen = 95:5):
(1) temperature raised from 25 to 250 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min;
(2) from 250 to 900 °C at 5 °C/min; (3) carbonization temperature
held for 2 h; and (4) sample cooled down naturally under protection
gas flow. Then, carbon fibers were activated at 850 °C under
CO2 gas flow (argon/CO2 = 95:5) for 3 h to generate
a porous structure on the carbon fiber surface. The sample cooled
down naturally under CO2 gas flow.

Fiber Size and Morphology
Observation
The size and
morphology of samples before and after carbonization were observed
by a Hitachi X-650 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan)
at 20 kV. The protein–lignin fiber samples were sputtered with
gold for 2 min before observation. The surface pores of the activated
carbon fiber were observed by a scanning electron microscope equipped
with a cold field emission gun at 15 kV (S-4800 FE-SEM, Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan). Fiber diameters were determined from scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images with the ImageJ image-visualization software developed
by the National Institute of Health.16 Two
hundred random positions were selected and measured for each sample.
A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL 2100, JEOL
Inc., Peabody, MA, US) was further employed to study the microstructure
of carbon fiber samples. For this, samples were ground into powders
and then deposited onto the 300 mesh Cu/Pd grids.

Fiber Textural
Characterization and Chemical Analysis
Autosorb iQ (Quantachrome
Instruments, Boynton Beach, FL, US) was
employed to measure the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm,
specific surface area, and porous texture at 77 K. The specific surface
area and pore size distribution were calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) theory and nonlocal density functional theory, respectively.
The micropore and external pore surface area were calculated by the t-plot method. These analyses were done by the Autosorb
iQ’s associated software (ASiQWin). Powder XRD patterns were
obtained to show the crystallinity of carbon by using a Bruker AXS
D8 DISCOVER diffractometer (Bruker Corporation, East Milton, ON, Canada)
with the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541841 Å) at 40 kV
and 44 mA (2θ was from 10 to 80°). Raman spectra were obtained
to examine the carbon sample structure by a Nicolet Omega XR Raman
microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, US). The excitation
near-infrared laser wavelength was set at 532 nm, and data points
were recorded at a 0.5 cm–1 interval. The nitrogen
and carbon contents of the protein–lignin fibers were measured
by a Leco nitrogen analyzer (FP-628, Leco, St. Joseph, MI, US). XPS
was applied to analyze the chemical composition of the carbon surface
using an Axis Ultra spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK).
X-radiation Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) was
used. The C 1s and N 1s core levels were fitted using the CasaXPS
software to reveal the C and N configuration.

Electrochemical Performance
Analysis
L2P8-900 samples
were ground and mixed with 10 w/w % carbon black and 10% PVDF binder
(10 w/w % in NMP) to form a paste. The paste was cast onto a piece
of nickel foam in an area of 1.0 cm2, dried under vacuum
at 120 °C for 12 h, and then pressed under 2000 psi by a benchtop
laboratory press (model 3851, Carver Inc., Wabash, IN, US) to fabricate
an electrode. Because L5P5-900 and L8P2-900 samples were flexible
and self-standing, they were used without binding treatment. To assemble
a three-electrode cell, the above prepared nickel foam or fiber mats
of L5P5-900/L8P2-900, a Pt wire, and a Hg/HgO electrode were used
as working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. All electrochemical
properties were analyzed by an Autolab PGSTAT128N (Metrohm Autolab,
Massasauga, ON, Canada). CV studies were performed in the potential
window of −1.0 to 0 V versus reference electrode at various
scan rates from 5 to 50 mV/s. Galvanostatic charge–discharge
curves were measured with a current density from 0.5 to 20 A/g. The
specific capacitance of carbon materials was calculated by the following
equation:  where I (A) is the discharge
current, Δt stands for the discharging time, m (g) is the weight of the carbon sample loaded on the working
electrode, and ΔV represents the potential
window. EIS was performed in a frequency range from 10–2 to 104 Hz with 5 mV amplitude with a symmetrical two-electrode
setup. To assemble symmetrical two-electrode cells, two pieces of
nickel foam were used as current collectors. Carbon fiber mat was
pressed onto nickel foam. Two pieces of identical carbon fiber mat
were placed together and separated by a filter paper as a separator.
