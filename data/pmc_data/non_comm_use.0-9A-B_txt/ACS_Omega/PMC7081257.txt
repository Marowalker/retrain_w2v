Polymeric
gels have been an important category for material scientists
due its versatile structural features. Hence, hydrogels are being
used to reduce excess production water in oil reservoirs. In this
work, cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) composite
hydrogels impregnated with bentonite clay (Bent) and bentonite clay
modified (Orgbentent) with the surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide were synthesized and characterized as a sealing agent in high
water producing permeable zones in the petroleum industry. The concept
of utilizing hydrophobically modified clay as an inorganic additive
in the hydrogel matrix emanates from the fact that this additive exhibit
greater interaction with the polymer chains. These interactions can
promote the inherent properties of the hydrogel. Polyethyleneimine
(PEI) was chosen as the cross-linking agent. HPAM/PEI conventional
hydrogels and HPAM/PEI/Bent and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent at 100 mg·L–1 clay were synthesized. The developed hydrogels were
characterized by a hybrid rheometer and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) instruments. Rheological results reveal that the (HPAM/PEI/Bent-3
and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3) composite hydrogels showed higher elastic
modulus (G′) and durability in the studied
conditions (stable at 30 days) than conventional ones (HPAM/PEI),
indicating the dispersion and reinforcing effect of clay. The functional
groups of these hydrogels were confirmed by FTIR, and TGA demonstrated
the structural reinforcement due to the presence of the clays, which
had lower weight loss than the conventional hydrogel. The hydrogel
morphologies were analyzed by SEM, and the results corroborated with
those obtained by TGA, indicating better structural reinforcement
when using organophilic clay.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Water shut-off techniques
are used for reducing water cuts in oil
fields,1,2 which have drawn considerable attention
recently due to extensive water production in mature oil fields.3 Reservoirs with induced fractures or high permeability
channels, commonly called thief zones or streaks, are quite common
in mature fields due to extensive water flooding.4,5 Consequently,
this problem promotes low oil recovery and excessive early water production
in these regions.5,6

For the past decades, polymer
gels have been shown as a remarkable
category for material scientists because of their versatile structural
characteristics, which have awakened many scientific researches involving
development, evaluation, and application in the most diverse areas.7−11 Particularly, polymeric hydrogels are said to be hydrophilic semisolids
whose three-dimensional (3D) structure involves a liquid part responsible
by its elastic character.12 In general,
it has (i) infinite molecular weight, (ii) are insoluble and not fusible,
and (iii) has the ability to swell reversibly.11,13

Because of these characteristics, hydrogels have been used
to prevent
and reduce the excessive water production in hydrocarbon reservoirs,
and it is one of the most effective and practical techniques applied
for this purpose.8,14−16 This chemical
technique is capable of plugging fractures and high permeability zones,
enhancing oil sweep efficiency, and achieving a successful conformance
control.17 In this method, in situ gels
are injected into the reservoir to form a 3D gel network structure
under reservoir conditions (temperature, salinity, and pH) that will
reduce permeability.18,19

The major difficulties
of this technique are related to the lack
of control in gelation time, gelling dilution, components loss by
adsorption on the rocks during injection, and, mostly, the destabilization
due to severe conditions.6,16

Therefore, the
obstacles found for the application of gelling solution
guide the need of adapting these materials for use. Thus, hydrogel
nanocomposites have been widely studied because it has better properties
compared to conventional ones. In addition, hydrogel nanocomposites
present better thermal and mechanical stabilities, which improve the
oil recovery efficiency.10,20−22

In order to improve the performance of these sealant agents,
studies
have been developed through the insertion of reinforcing fillers in
the structures of these materials. Among the most mentioned are carbon
nanotubes,23−27 nanosilica,10,28−31 coal fly ash,9,22,32,33 and clays.13,34−41 Chen et al.31 observed that nanosilica
decreased the gelation time and increased the rigidity of the polyacrylamide/polyethyleneimine
hydrogels. The same was observed by Aalaie et al.13 when developing hydrogels with montmorillonite clay. The
polymer chains aggregate the clay surface in order to interact with
single clay platelets at several points of their extension. As a consequence,
the formation of a single polymer–clay structure promotes changes
in the characteristics of the materials.42

The use of organic modified fillers was mentioned by Helvacioğlu
and co-workers,35 which were used to improve
the performance of polyacrylamide hydrogels, while Rezaei et al.43 used similar organic fillers in partially hydrolyzed
polyacrylamide polymer dispersions (HPAM), where improvements were
observed in their fluid properties.

The present work introduces
a hydrogel nanocomposite synthesized
from partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), polyethyleneimine
(PEI) as a cross-linker, and modified or unmodified bentonite clay
as fillers. Moreover, the effects of cross-linker and modified and
unmodified bentonite clay concentrations were investigated in salinity
and temperature reservoir conditions. Finally, rheological tests were
performed to determine the strength of the hydrogel nanocomposites.

2 Experimental Part
2.1 Materials
Partially
hydrolyzed polyacrylamide
(HPAM) with an average molecular weight of 8 × 106 g/mol (hydrolysis degree of 30%) was provided by SNF FLOERGER, with
trade name FP3330S. Branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) with an average
molecular weight of 25.000 g/mol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
to work as an organic cross-linker. The clay used in this work was
a sodium bentonite clay (Na+-Bent), predominantly montmorillonite,
with a trade name of Argel-40, provided by Bentonit União Nordeste
Indústria e Comercio Ltda. Argel-40 is a natural sodium bentonite
with high mineralogical purity with a cation exchange capacity (CEC)
of 110 meq/100 g. Table 1 presents the physical and chemical properties of the bentonite clay.
Hexadecyltrimethylammoniumbromide with ≥98% purity was also
used, provided by Sigma-Aldrich (SP, Brazil), and used as received.

2.2 Chemical Modification of Bentonite Clay
The sodium bentonite clay has metallic ions occupying the interlayer
space. With the addition of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant,
these ions were replaced by surfactant molecules. This methodology
was based on Calderon et al.44 and Ezquerro
et al.45 Initially, 5 g of sodium bentonite
was dispersed in 500 mL of deionized water under continuous stirring
(25 °C) over 24 h. Then, an aqueous solution of quaternary ammonium
salt was added to the suspension containing sodium bentonite at a
concentration equivalent to 100% CEC and kept under stirring for 24
h. After that, the suspension was filtered and washed several times
with distilled water to remove bromide residues. The organophilic
clay was then dried at 50 °C for 72 h, milled, and stored at
room temperature. The clays were milled and sieved to 200 mesh and
used without purification.

2.3 Synthesis of Nanocomposite
and Conventional
Hydrogels
The conventional (HPAM/PEI) and nanocomposite (HPAM/PEI/Bent
and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent) hydrogels were developed according to the following
steps. Partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide was initially dissolved
in injection water (Table 2) for 72 h to obtain a homogenized solution. At the same time,
the polyethyleneimine was dissolved in deionized water for 24 h. Bentonite
clay dispersions were prepared by stirring the powder in brine through
an ultrasonic homogenizer (500W-Cole Parmer) for 1 min. The sequence
of preparation of the gelling solutions is shown in Figure 1.

2.4 Characterization

The bentonite
clay was characterized after the modification to determine the efficiency
of this procedure using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The hydrogel samples were evaluated
at 1, 7, 15, and 30 days as follows: gel strength code through the
bottle test described at Table 4,46 rheological behavior, FTIR,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy

2.4.1 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR)
FTIR spectra of the samples were obtained by a Frontier
FT-IR/FIR spectrometer in the range of 4000 to 400 cm–1 using the KBr pellet method for clays and attenuated total reflectance
method (ATR) for the hydrogels dried after 15 days of aging. Spectra
were taken with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

2.4.2 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD analyses
were performed with a Diffrac Plus v1.01 model (Bruker) wide-angle
X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu anode running at 40 kV and 30 mA,
scanning from 4° to 20° at 2° min–1.

2.4.3 Gel Strength Code
The bottle test
was used to obtain a semiquantitative analysis of the gelation time,
final consistency, and strength reached by the hydrogel over the aging
time. In this work, the gel characterization was denoted by alphabetic
codes from A to G.10,19

In this context, “code
A” refers to a fluid state solution without changes in initial
viscosity, and the advancement of these codes indicates changes in
the state of this solution. For example, “code B” indicates
a highly flowing gel, “code C” indicates a few flowing
gel, “code D” a moderately flowing gel where a portion
of the gel (about 5–15%) does not flow to the bottle cap upon
inversion, “code E” shows a barely flowing gel where
a small portion of the gel stays at the bottom at inversion, “code
F” is an indication of a highly deformable nonflowing gel,
and “code G” is a moderately deformable nonfluent gel.

2.4.4 Rheological Analysis
(i) Injectivity:
The viscosity of gelling solutions was obtained to evaluate the injection
capacity of the solutions in application conditions, where the shear
rate was between 1 and 400 s–1 at a temperature
of 30 °C.

(ii) Viscoelastic behavior: Dynamic oscillatory
measurements were used, varying the frequency from 0.1 to 100 Hz,
with a fixed deformation of 1% at 70 °C to obtain the viscoelastic
behavior of hydrogels samples. The rheometer used was the Discovery
Hybrid Rheometer-3 from TA Instruments with parallel-plate geometry.
Previous studies demonstrated that this geometry offers better measurement
reproducibility of viscous modulus and elastic modulus for polymer
gels.

2.4.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA curves were realized using a TGA Q500 V6.7 Build 203 in a nitrogen
atmosphere up to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.

2.4.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The
surface morphology of the dried hydrogels was observed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) by the Hitachi TM3030Plus instrument at
15 kV voltage.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of Bentonite Clay and Organoclay
3.1.1 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns
of the bentonite clay before and after modification with hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide surfactant where it was observed that, after modification
of the clay, the main diffraction peak shifts to smaller angle values,
proving the intercalation of organic cations between silicate layers.

Figure 2 XRD spectra
of unmodified and organophilic bentonite clay.

For the unmodified bentonite, two diffraction peaks are seen in
the low angle region: the main one is at 2θ = 6.85°, and
the other at 2θ = 13.48° referring to a smaller crystalline
phase. For the modified bentonite, only one peak was observed at 2θ
= 4.98°, showing that the modification contributed to a structural
modification. The main peak corresponds the interplanar distances
between clay layers, which were calculated by the Bragg equation:  where λ is the wavelength used (0.179
nm), θ is the half of diffraction angle in the main peak (obtained
by 2θ/2), and d is the calculated basal space
between clay layers. Using the Bragg equation, the basal spacing d(001) values of unmodified and organophilic
clays were 1.51 and 2.06 nm, respectively. The d(001) of sodium clay found is characteristic of an hydrated
montmorillonite. The XRD patterns show that, after modification of
the sodium clay with quaternary ammonium salt, the diffraction peaks
shift to smaller angle values, proving the intercalation of the organic
cations between the silicate layers.47,48

3.1.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR)
The FTIR spectra of bentonite clay before and after
modification with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant are
shown in Figure 3.
The spectra show the presence of peaks at 3635 and 3434 cm–1, which define the bands related to the free and/or combined OH group.
The presence of H2O is confirmed by the absorption at approximately
1650 cm–1 corresponding to the H–O–H
angular deformation.49 These are present
in both unmodified and modified clays. The spectra also have peaks
at 1035 cm–1, characteristic of asymmetric Si–O
stretching, Si–O, and O–Al vibration at 720 and 520
cm–1, respectively. The presence of the same peaks
in all samples indicates that the structures of the modified clay
samples were maintained after organophilic treatment. The FTIR spectra
of the modified clays contain a pair of bands between 2851 and 2924
cm–1, which result from asymmetric and symmetric
vibration C–H stretching of the CH3 and CH2 groups present in the amine chains and the angular deformation of
CH2 group at 1470 cm–1.50 The appearance of these peaks confirms the organophilization
of the clay.

clay.

3.2 Injectivity
Evaluation of Gelling Solution
The viscosity profiles of
the gelling systems (before gel formation)
were obtained in order to evaluate the injection capacity and propagation
of these systems in the reservoirs. During the pumping of the fluid
into the reservoir, higher shear rates can be found (above 300 s–1), while for the fluid propagation inside of the reservoir,
the shear rates are very low (less than 20 s–1).51 Thus, the purpose of this test was to evaluate
the applicability of the gelling solutions developed in relation to
its injectivity considering 30 mPa·s as an ideal viscosity for
injection according to some studies.52,53 The viscosity
values of the samples were obtained by flow curves, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Flow curves of gelling
solution.

The gelling systems showed a pseudoplastic
behavior during all
evaluated shear rates. For lower shear rates, it was observed that
the fluids presented greater resistance to flow due to the hydrogen-bonding
interactions, entanglements of the polymer and cross-linker chains,
and intra- and intermolecular electrostatic repulsions promoted between
components. For higher shear rates, the viscosity of the fluid is
less dependent on shear and may be observed a moderate pseudoplastic
behavior that is extremely desirable to ensure a good injectivity
of the gel.51 The viscosity of the gelling
solutions with and without clays was 18.0–19.1 mPa·s considering
a shear rate of 300 s–1. However, at a lower rate
(10 s–1), the viscosity values of the fluids were
between 67.5 and 76.9 mPa·s.

3.3 Viscoelastic
Behavior of the Hydrogels
To examine the cross-linking properties
at 70 °C, three types
of hydrogels (HPAM/PEI, HPAM/PEI/Bent, and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent) were
employed in these experiments with a polymer concentration of 5000
mg·L–1. PEI concentrations were from 1000 to
2200 mg·L–1. Initially, the cross-linking process
was monitored qualitatively through visual observation by using bottle
testing. Sydansk’s gel strength code was used for assigning
the gel strength. Table 4 shows the effect of cross-linker concentration and the influence
of the clay on the gelation rate and gel strength with time.

The gelation time is an important parameter for choosing the gelling
system because it needs to be higher than the period required to inject
the solution into the reservoir in order to guarantee the safety of
the operation and also its ability to penetrate high region permeability.54

At the aging time of 1 day, the systems
did not show a gel characteristic,
suggesting that the cross-links and entanglements between the polymers
molecules were insufficient to change the condition of the gelling
solution. This fact is correlated with the type of interaction because,
in the case of PEI, it is kinetically slow and occurs through the
formation of covalent bonds by the transamidation mechanism,55 which involves direct interconversion of the
amide group present in HPAM with the amine group present in PEI, resulting
in cross-linking between macromolecules.

Thus, within the pre-established
conditions of temperature, salinity,
and component concentration, the samples showed only a significant
change in viscosity after 24 h. From a practical point of view, this
allows these materials to penetrate into deeper regions of the reservoirs,
presenting a good safety time for the gelation process.

For
the three systems, a higher gel strength can be achieved with
increasing the PEI concentration above 1600 mg L–1. The high PEI concentration can increase the chance of PEI attacking
the carbonyl carbon attached to the amide group. Therefore, increasing
the PEI concentration is not recommended by using the targeted gel.
On the contrary, the higher cross-linker concentration can greatly
impact the gel stability for gel syneresis due to the excessive cross-linking
characteristic.

At the period of 7–30 days, the hydrogels
did not present
significant visual variations, as shown in Figure 5. This indicates a stable plateau of the
gelling process being related to the consumption kinetics of the cross-linking
agent.

Figure 5 Visual appearance of the hydrogels at the aging times of 7 and
15 days in the order previously presented.

3.3.1 Influence of Clay in Rheological Properties
Figure 6 shows the
curves of elastic modulus (G′) and viscous
modulus (G″) as a function of frequency for
the conventional and nanocomposite hydrogel samples obtained with
the highest cross-linker concentration (2200 mg·L–1) at days 1, 7, 15, and 30.

Figure 6 Elastic (G′) and viscous
(G″) modulus as a function of frequency for
conventional (HPAM/PEI)
and nanocomposites (HPAM/PEI/Bent and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent) hydrogels
to the following times: (a) 1 day, (b) 7 days, (c) 15 days, and (d)
30 days.

At the aging time of 1 day, the
systems presented that the G″ is higher than G′ at low-frequency
values. This indicates the presence of a viscous liquid material,
where much of the fluid energy is dissipated. At high-frequency values,
the component G′ exceeds G″, and the fluid begins to behave as an elastic solid material.
This viscous–elastic transition is indicated by the cross-point
of the curves G′ and G″
(around 2 Hz), which is a typical behavior of concentrated polymer
solutions, where there is a large amount of entanglement between the
macromolecules (Figure 6a).

This behavior is related to the ability to recover the
equilibrium
configuration by molecular Brownian motion, where, at low oscillatory
frequencies, the polymer chains are capable of recovering the initial
configuration, behaving like viscous liquids (G″
> G′). On the other hand, at higher frequency
values, the oscillation becomes faster, and the macromolecules cannot
be disentangled, behaving temporarily as if they were reticulated
(entanglements). Therefore, the way to accommodate the energy stored
in the system is through the deformation of the formed network, resulting
in the elastic behavior above the cross-point.56

At the aging time of 7 days, the samples exhibited
the predominant
elastic modulus, which confirms the formation of a characteristic
three-dimensional gel network. At this time, supposed that G′ represents the amounts of interactions PEI-HPAM
and Clay-HPAM and entanglements between the macromolecules, consequently,
it shows a higher elastic contribution, all on the same level. Also,
the viscous modulus (G″) may represent the
amount of chains in the free state; for this reason, the conventional
material (HPAM/PEI-3) exhibited a slightly higher viscous modulus.
By comparison, this is specifically related to the contribution of
the amount of cross-linking points through clay–polymer interactions
of the samples HPAM/PEI/Bent-3 and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3.

According
to Haraguchi et al.,57 the
mechanism of interaction of polyacrylamide and clays occurs through
hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms present in the clay structure
and the protons of the amide group of the polymer. However, in addition
to this interaction, since HPAM is an anionic polymer, ionic interactions
may also occur with bentonite, which has positive charges on the surface.
This justifies a lower viscous modulus of these materials at 7 days.

At 15 days of aging time, the nanocomposites exhibited that the G′ is higher than the conventional hydrogel in the
oscillatory frequency range of 1–10 Hz. So, HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3
exhibited an elastic character slightly higher than the HPAM/PEI/Bent-3
sample probably due to the surfactant molecules present in the clay
surface that interact with the polymer chains of HPAM. This difference
was better observed at the 30 days of aging, where the G′ of the HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3 sample was noticeably larger than
the G′ of the HPAM/PEI/Bent-3 sample.

Therefore, it has been suggested that the mechanism of interaction
of the HPAM/PEI/Orgbent nanocomposites also occurred by van der Waals
interactions since the modified cation adsorbed in bentonite has alkyl
chains in its structure. In addition, the organic clay promoted a
better compatibility of bentonite as an additive to the polymer dispersion
(visually compared), obtaining a better response in this property.

Other studies in the literature also showed that the addition of
nanoparticles in gel systems increased the elastic property more significantly
than the viscous property, indicating that the dynamic adsorption/desorption
equilibrium with the polymer chains promotes a greater elasticity
in the material.13,34

The evaluation at day 30
showed in fact the superiority in the
viscoelastic behavior of the nanocomposite hydrogels against the conventional
hydrogel since this latter presented a drastic fall in the elastic
modulus with the crossing of G″ and G′ curves, which indicates the flow state of the
material and the possible breaking of its three-dimensional polymer
network.

In contrast, the nanocomposite hydrogels exhibited
the same plateau
in the curve from the viscous modulus, while the G′ of HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3 remained higher, like day 15. This
shows the largest number of interactions in this system compared to
HPAM/PEI/Bent-3. This observation can be attributed to the different
types of interactions of conventional and nanocomposite hydrogels.
In the first case, the mechanism is necessarily influenced by the
cross-linking agent, while the nanocomposites have the synergistic
effect of PEI and clay.

3.3.2 Stability of Conventional
and Nanocomposite
Hydrogels
Figure 7 shows the G′ values of HPAM/PEI,
HPAM/PEI/Bent, and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent samples as a function of frequency
at the aging times from 1 to 30 days, allowing us to evaluate the
elastic character in different times to the three samples studied.

Figure 7 Elastic
modulus (G′) as a function of frequency
for HPAM/PEI, HPAM/PEI/Bent, and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent hydrogels at different
aging times.

As previously described, on the
first day, the samples did not
show a gel behavior. At 7 days, the rheological parameter G′ increased significantly due to the cross-linking
process, becoming highly independent of the frequency, where, in all
cases, the G′ was close to 10 Pa in the frequency
range of 1–10 Hz. Some studies in the literature indicate that
this behavior is found in most gels that presented a rigid structural
state, with good organization and three-dimensional perfection.51,58

Commonly observed for frequency values above 10 Hz, the behavior
of G′ showed variation with frequency. Some
authors relate this effect to the breaking of a hydrogel 3D structure
due to the increase in the amount of oscillations per unit of time,
where the energy superimposed on the surface promotes the destruction
of internal connections.51,59

At the aging
time of 15 days, the G′ of
the HPAM/PEI-3 sample remained in the same region of the evaluation
of the aging time of 7 days, indicating that there was stabilization
under the contribution of the amount of molecular interactions. Therefore,
it is suggested that, in this period, all species of cross-linking
agent (PEI) had already been consumed.

However, at the time
of 15 days, the HPAM/PEI/Bent-3 and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3
samples still showed an increase in G′, which
is related to the greater number of interaction sites promoted by
the clay. In this way, PEI and clay would be contributing synergistically
to the interactions between the macromolecules of HPAM. Some studies
showed that this is related to the high interaction of polyacrylamide
chains and clay so that they are fixed in the gel structure as additional
interaction sites (polymer–clay).34,36

On day 30, the viscoelastic analysis of the conventional sample
(HPAM/PEI-3) showed an abrupt drop of G′ modulus
at low frequencies, and it was also observed that there is a great
variation of G′ with the increase in oscillatory
frequency, indicating destabilization of the hydrogel. On the other
hand, both hydrogel nanocomposites presented the elastic modulus still
independent of the frequency, showing the stability of these materials
until the last evaluated time, although these hydrogels already show
signs of destabilization since G′ of 30 days
< G′ of 7 days.

Therefore, the nanomaterials
presented a reinforcement capacity
of the 3D network structure at the studied conditions, altering the
stability of the hydrogel produced. From a practical point of view,
it would guarantee a longer blocking time in fractured oil reservoirs
compared to conventional hydrogels. However, in this study, no significant
difference was observed between the systems composed of modified clay
HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3 and unmodified clay HPAM/PEI/Bent-3.

3.3.3 Influence of Cross-Linking Concentration
in the Viscoelastic Behavior
Figure 8 shows the elastic modulus and viscous modulus
as a function of frequency for HPAM/PEI, HPAM/PEI/Bent, and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent
samples at cross-linking concentrations of 1000, 1600, and 2200 mg·L–1.

Figure 8 Elastic modulus (G′) and viscous
modulus
(G″) for the samples (HPAM/PEI, HPAM/PEI/Bent,
and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent) with different cross-linking concentrations
at 15 days.

The cross-linking concentration
is one of the responsible factors
that change the gelling kinetics. This happens because, at high concentrations
of PEI, a greater amount of chains is dispersed in the solution, which
facilitates the encounter with the HPAM molecules, promoting the occurrence
of cross-links.

A study by Jia and co-workers60 reported
the influence of the cross-linking concentration, where the increase
in its concentration contributed to a greater stiffness of the hydrogel
due to a greater occurrence of intermolecular bonds.

In fact,
the effect of the cross-linker concentration influenced
the kinetics and responses of the G′ and G″ of the gels, promoting the increase in the elastic
and viscous character that shows the performance of the cross-linking
agent and its limit against the gelation process.

At the aging
time of 15 days, all samples with the lowest cross-linking
concentration (HPAM/PEI-1, HPAM/PEI/Bent-1, and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-1)
presented lower G′ values. It happens because
PEI is at low concentrations, which decreases the number of molecules
that are available to form cross-links, contributing to fewer interactions.

Nanocomposite hydrogels with higher cross-linking concentrations
(1600 and 2200 mg·L–1) had a higher G′ modulus because of the greater number of cross-links
in this period. However, HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3 showed a high value of
elastic modulus since the organically modified clay may have promoted
van der Waals interactions of hydrogen bonds with clay-HPAM and clay-PEI,
increasing significantly the behavior of the elastic nature of these
samples.

3.4 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR)
of Hydrogel Nanocomposites
The chemical structures of the
hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
and FTIR spectra of the conventional HPAM/PEI hydrogel and nanocomposite
hydrogels with unmodified bentonite (HPAM/PEI-Bent) and organophilic
bentonite (HPAM/PEI-Orgbent) are shown in Figure 9. The conventional HPAM/PEI hydrogel presented
a characteristic band of OH and NH2 groups at 3380 cm–1, small stretching vibrations of methyl groups at
2939 cm–1, and bands at the regions of 1659 and
1548 cm–1 corresponding to the C=O group
and angular deformations of N–H, respectively.22,61 In addition, a low intensity band at 1456 cm–1 attributed to NH2 (amide) bending and C–N amide
stretching vibrations at 1411 cm–1.36

Figure 9 FTIR spectra of the conventional HPAM/PEI hydrogel and the nanocomposite
hydrogels with unmodified bentonite and organophilic bentonite.

The nanocomposite hydrogels exhibited the same
absorption bands
demonstrated for the conventional hydrogel; however, they presented
long peaks and with higher intensities. At values close to 3600–3400
cm–1, the enlargement was due to vibrations of stretching
of O–H groups between the octahedral and tetrahedral sheets
of the clay and the vibrations of water molecules hydroxyls (−OH)
located between the layers of the clay, which were not removed in
the drying of the hydrogels, and at 1649 cm–1, an
increase in peak intensity occurred due to the band of the flexural
vibration of the Si–O–Si characteristic of the bentonite.49,61 Comparing the nanocomposite systems, it was observed that the HPAM/PEI-Orgbent
hydrogel presented CH2 asymmetric and symmetric stretching
vibrations at 2924 and 2851 cm–1, which prove the
presence of alkyl chains of the surfactant; axial deformation of the
C–N group of aliphatic amines at 1174 cm–1 is also characteristic of the surfactant used for the modification
of the clay according to the literature.48,50 Thus, it can be verified that the incorporation of the organophilic
clay and unmodified bentonite occurred satisfactorily in hydrogels.

3.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis of Hydrogels
The thermogravimetric analysis of the HPAM/PEI-3, HPAM/PEI/Bent-3,
and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3 samples clearly demonstrates the thermal stability
of nanocomposite materials. In Figure 10, a loss of moisture was observed from the
beginning of heating to near 160 °C. After that, it was observed
that there is the loss of ammonia released from the transamidation
reaction between the amide groups of the HPAM chains and the amines
of the PEI.62 The most significant mass
loss occurred at 300 °C, which was attributed to the structural
breakdown of the polymer chains and the intermolecular bonds between
HPAM-PEI. From this temperature, it was observed that the nanocomposite
hydrogels were less susceptible to degradation than the conventional
ones (HPAM/PEI-3), which was attributed to the strong interactions
between the clays with the polymer molecules. Hence, it appears that
thermal stability of hydrogel increased by incorporation of bentonite
and organic bentonite, perhaps due to the resistance to heat by clays
present inside the hydrogel network.

Figure 10 TGA curves of hydrogels formed.

3.6 SEM Analysis
The
morphologies of
the fully dry samples were analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) instrument. The SEM micrographs of HPAM/PEI-3, HPAM/PEI/Bent-3,
and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3 consolidate the results obtained in the rheological
sections. In Figure 11a,b, HPAM/PEI-3 hydrogels, a continuous polymer network is not observed,
indicating a possible fragile 3D structure, without junction points
and low cross-link density. In Figure 11c,d, the HPAM/PEI/Bent-3 hydrogels, it is
possible to observe the polymer structure with some interaction points
but a little dense network. Further, a large porosity is observed,
which may be related to the lower affinity of the unmodified clay.
In Figure 11e,f, HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3
shows a continuous network with few pores and a high polymer density.
In both hydrogels with clays, no evidence of agglomerations from the
clay mineral was seen. This analogy corroborated with the previous
results, visually showing the greatest strength of hydrogels with
modified clay. Previous studies on reinforced nanocomposite hydrogels
have reported similar SEM results.22,63,64

and

4 Conclusions
In this work, partially
hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM)-based
hydrogels impregnated with bentonite clay (Bent) and bentonite clay
modified (Orgbent) with the surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide were developed and characterized as a sealing agent for high
water producing zones in mature oil fields in petroleum industries.
Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was used as the cross-linking agent. HPAM/PEI
conventional hydrogels and HPAM/PEI/Bent and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent at 100
mg·L–1 clay were fabricated. The viscoelastic
and thermal properties as well as the structural and morphological
properties of these hydrogels were studied in detail. It was demonstrated
that the use of bentonite and organic bentonite clays as reinforcement
fillers in HPAM/PEI-based systems was a success. In terms of injectivity,
these materials did not alter the viscosity of the solutions, which
is considered an important factor for operational issues.

The
gel strengths determined via rheological approach showed that
(HPAM/PEI/Bent-3 and HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3) hydrogels containing clay
were practically more elastic than the HPAM/PEI conventional hydrogels,
which can be attributed to the additional points of interaction of
the clay with the HPAM chains. The nanocomposite formed with organic
bentonite (HPAM/PEI/Orgbent-3) showed better stability (remaining
stable at 30 days). FTIR analysis confirmed the chemical structures
in all the hydrogels.

TGA analysis revealed that the nanocomposite
hydrogels were less
susceptible to degradation than the conventional ones (HPAM/PEI-3).
The SEM micrographs confirmed the results obtained in the thermogravimetric
and rheological analyses, indicating that the addition of nanofillers
provided an increase in the hydrogel strength and the system prepared
with organophilic clay presented a denser structure with the absence
of porosity and, consequently, more reinforcement, and this is due
to the greater interaction of the modified bentonite with the polymer
matrix.

Lastly, the variation in the content of the cross-linking
agent
also showed influence on gelation in the achieved state of the gels
and, especially, on the elastic character acquired by these materials.
