Electronic waste management is one
of the key challenges for the
green revolution without affecting the environment. The wide use of
printer devices has brought a horde of discarded waste toner, which
release ∼6000 tons of processed carbon powder into the atmosphere
every year that would essentially pollute the atmosphere. Here, we
propose a one-step thermal conversion of waste toner powder into carbon/Fe3O4 nanocomposites for energy storage applications.
Recovered toner carbon (RTC) and toner carbon calcined at 300 °C
(RTC-300) were characterized using various analytical tools. From
the FE-SEM analysis, the presence of carbon particles with uniformly
decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles was confirmed.
RTC-300 carbon was used as an electrode material for supercapacitors,
and it exhibited a high specific capacitance of 536 F/g at a current
density of 3 A/g, which is almost six times higher than that of the
commercial mesoporous graphitized carbon black. RTC-300 showed excellent
electrochemical stability of 97% over 5000 cycles at a high current
density of 20 A/g. The fabricated symmetric cell using RTC-300 electrode
materials in an aqueous electrolyte with a cell voltage of 1.8 V delivered
a high energy and high-power density of 42 W h/kg and 14.5 kW/kg,
respectively. The fabricated device is stable up to 20,000 cycles
at a high current density of 20 A/g with a loss of 23% capacitance.

==== Body
1 Introduction
At
present, environmental pollution is one of the utmost problems
that the world is facing, which is causing serious and long-lasting
damage to natural resources and living things.1,2 Pollution
occurs by many forms of waste that end up in landfills such as chemicals
in the form of solids, liquids, and gases that affect the environment
either directly or indirectly.3 According
to a Planet Ark report in 2006, approximately 500 million ink cartridges
(toner) end up in a landfill site around the world every year.4 This would create waste of 3000 tons of plastic,
2500 tons of ferrous metals, 400 tons of aluminum, and 26 kg of precious
metals5 (Figure S1). An ″empty″ cartridge contains 8% unused residual
powder by weight, and it may be more, depending on the types of printer
models.6Table S1 summarizes the major chemical compounds present in HP black toner
powder based on the literature. Approximately, 6000 tons of carbon
powder is ejected into the atmosphere every year that would essentially
pollute the atmosphere, water and soil.1,7,8

Previously, some investigation has been shown
on transforming waste
toner carbon into potentially useful materials like synthetic oils,9 nano-SiO2, SiO2–carbon,
nano-Fe3O4,7,8 fillers,6 and colorants6 in
the rubber manufacturing process. For instance, Gaikwad et al. reported
a thermal transformation of waste toner powder into value-added ferrous
materials.7 At a high temperature of 1550
°C, there is a complete transformation of toner powder into ferrous
materials (98%) where the carbon was used as an inherent reducing
agent. Most recently, Li et al. reported a single-step thermal conversion
of toner powder for use as anode materials for Li-ion battery applications.8 The heat-treated carbon-coated ferric oxides
exhibited a discharge specific capacity of 1029 mA h/g. In all of
the above methods, all the copolymers are thermally converted into
carbon, carbon monoxide, and CO2, which again leads to
an increase in the environmental pollution. Here, we demonstrated
a one-step thermal conversion of toner powder at 300 °C into
a carbon/Fe3O4 nanocomposite for symmetric supercapacitor
applications. From the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge
(CD) analysis, the prepared RTC-300 electrode materials exhibited
a high specific capacitance of 536 F/g at a current density of 3 A/g,
which is six times higher than that of the commercial mesoporous graphitized
carbon black (MGCB).10

2 Results and Discussion
A single-step carbonization process
for conversion of waste toner
cartridge-derived RTC to RTC-300 is schematically shown in Figure 1a. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) profile of RTC shows a well-distinguished weight loss
for adsorbed moisture and decomposition of the polymer and activated
carbon (Figure 1b).8 From the profile, a slight
weight loss of 1% was observed up to 150 °C due to the removal
of physically and chemically adsorbed moisture. Further, when the
temperature increased, a significant amount of weight loss (47%) is
observed between 200 and 380 °C owing to the loss of the polymer
backbone as carbon and CO2.11 Usually, the decomposition of the polymer backbone took place at
temperatures higher than 300 °C.12 Additionally, a 6% weight loss is observed in the temperature region
of 380 to 500 °C, which is mainly due to the decomposition of
fixed carbon like an activated carbon block into CO and CO2.2,13 Above 500 °C, the TGA profile is stable up to
1000 °C, which clearly reveals that ∼46% of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the recovered material are
from the waste toner.6,14

Figure 1 (a) Schematic representation of RTC preparation
from a waste toner
cartridge; (b) TGA profile of RTC and (c) XRD patterns of RTC, RTC-300,
and RTC-500 with a cubic Fe3O4 standard pattern
(ICDD no. 01-088-0866).

The powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of RTC, RTC-300, and
RTC-500 are shown in Figure 1c. All the three samples show highly intense peaks, and the
observed peaks are indexed to the standard pattern of crystalline
cubic Fe3O4 (ICDD card no: 01-088-0866). The
diffraction peaks that appeared at 2θ values of 18.3, 30.1,
35.4, 37.1, 43.1, 53.5, 57.1, 62.6, and 74.1° are assigned to
the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440), and (533)
planes of Fe3O4, respectively. During the heat
treatment, the intensity of the XRD lines increased while the temperature
increased, which reflects the highly crystalline nature of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles with high-temperature treatment.
However, when increasing the temperature, the width of the XRD peaks
decreased, which indicates the large crystallite size of the nanoparticles.
From the XRD pattern, the average crystallite size of the particles
is calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation.15 The calculated average crystallite sizes of
Fe3O4 nanoparticles in RTC, RTC-300, and RTC-500
are 45, 56, and 62 nm, respectively.

The field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images
of as-received RTC at low and high magnifications are shown in Figure 2a–c. It could
be clearly seen that the sphere-shaped toner powder with an average
size of 2–5 μm consisted of a few nanometer-sized Fe3O4 nanoparticles decorated on polymeric compounds
(Figure 2c). The FE-SEM
images of RTC-300 at low and high magnifications (Figure 2d–f and Figure S2) demonstrated that after the heat treatment,
the sphere-shaped toner particles are significantly transformed into
carbon/Fe3O4 nanocomposites. The micron-sized
sphere-like RTC particles are converted into nanosized particles (RTC-300
and RTC-500) where 50–100 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles
are decorated on carbon surfaces (Figure 2f). This is due to the thermal decomposition
of the styrene acrylate-based copolymer into carbon-based materials.16,17 Furthermore, the elemental mapping of RTC-300 materials shown in Figure 2g–j confirmed
the presence of C, O, and Fe elements, which are uniformly distributed
on the entire surface. This observation evidently confirms the presence
of carbon and Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the RTC-300
nanocomposite materials. In addition, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of RTC-500 are shown in Figure 3. When the carbonization temperature increased
up to 500 °C, the carbon materials decomposed as CO/CO2 and resulted in aggregated Fe3O4 nanoparticles
with trace amounts of carbon. The elemental composition analysis of
RTC-300 and RTC-500 by EDX confirmed the above statement (Figure S3). The drastic reduction in the carbon
content in RTC-500 compared to RTC-300 clearly confirmed the decomposition
of carbon.

magnifications and elemental mapping of (g) all elements mixed (Mix),
(h) carbon (C), (i) oxygen (O), and (j) iron (Fe) in RTC-300 samples.

Figure 3 (a–c) SEM images of RTC-500 at different magnifications.

The microstructure of the recovered RTC-300 and
RTC-500 materials
was investigated using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm analysis (Figure 4). According to the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification, the resulting
isotherm of RTC-300 and RTC-500 exhibited a typical type-IV isotherm,
which is the characteristic of porous materials.18 The narrow silt-like pore shape (H4 classification) was
observed for RTC-300 and RTC-500 (Figure 4). RTC-300 showed a high specific
surface area (SSA) and pore volume of 16.4 m2/g and 0.111
cm3/g, respectively. However, RTC-500 showed a relative
low SSA and pore volume of 3.2 m2/g and 0.018 cm3/g, respectively. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
pore size distribution study designates that the recovered RTC-300
and RTC-500 have a pore diameter in the range of 3.0 to 5.6 and 3.0
to 9.6 nm, respectively (Figure 4, inset). The average pore radii
of the RTC-300 and RTC-500 materials are 1.5 and 1.52 nm, respectively.
The combination of micro- and mesoporous with high SSA and pore volume
will enable the fast access to the electrode surface through the pores
at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which is of huge benefits
during the charge–discharge process.

isotherm of (a) RTC-300 and (b)
RTC-500 and their corresponding BJH pore size distribution curve (inset).

Further, the prepared RTC-300 and RTC-500 electrode
materials were
tested for energy storage applications in supercapacitor devices.
Thus, specific electrochemical characterization tools such as cyclic
voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD), and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis were carried
out for supercapacitor applications. CV was carried out between −1.2
and 0.6 V (vs Hg/HgO) at various scan rates in 3.5 M KOH electrolyte.
The typical CV profiles of RTC-300 and RTC-500 electrode materials
at 50 mV/s scan rates are shown Figure 5a. The area of the CV profile is larger for RTC-300
than that for RTC-500. This is due to the presence of carbon in the
RTC-300 nanocomposite materials. The CV profiles of RTC-300 and RTC-500
electrode materials at different scan rates (5–50 mV/s) are
displayed in Figure 5b,c, respectively. A nonsymmetrical shape with a set of redox peaks
appears for all the scan rates for both electrode materials. It clearly
confirms the faradaic nature of the electrodes due to the presence
of redox-active Fe3O4 nanoparticles.19−22 The observed oxidation and reduction peaks are attributed to the
reversible faradaic process for Fe2+ ⇌ Fe3+ in alkaline OH anions.20

and RTC-500 at a 50 mV/s scan rate,

(d) plots of specific capacity (Cq) vs
reciprocal of the square root of scan rate (v-1/2), and (e) reciprocal of specific capacity (Cq–1) vs the square root of
scan rate (v1/2). (f) Bar diagram of the
specific capacity (Cq) of RTC-300 and
RTC-500 electrodes with capacitive (EDLC, red) and diffusive (PC,
blue) charging derived from Trasatti’s method.

The capacitive contribution of electrical double layer capacitance
(EDLC) and pseudocapacitive (PC) reactions of electrode materials
are evaluated by the Trasatti method.23 Using this method, we have demonstrated the quantitative isolation
of the capacitive elements (EDLC) from the diffusion controlled insertion
processes (PC). In these methods, plotting the specific capacity as
a function of scan rate reveals the charge-storing mechanism of the
electrode materials.24,25 In general, the specific capacity
decreased when the scan rate increased correspondingly. Assuming ion
diffusion follows a semi-infinite linear diffusion ν →
0 (i.e., giving sufficient time for ions to diffuse and react from
bulk electrolyte to the electrode–electrolyte interface), the
possibility of an accessible “inner surface” area of
the material gives the maximum specific capacity of the electrode
materials (q → qT).26 Similarly, assuming that ion diffusion
follows a semi-infinite linear diffusion ν → α
(i.e., just allowing surface processes to happen), the only accessible
area is the “outer surface” of the electrode–electrolyte
interface, which gives the specific capacity of the electrode materials
(q → qo).27 The specific capacity as a function of ν1/2 and ν–1/2 is shown in Figure 5 d,e. Linear fitting
of the plot and extrapolating the fitted line to the y axis gives the Co, and subtraction of Co from CT yields
the maximum pseudocapacitance (Ci).24 The detailed Trasatti method of analysis is
given in the Supporting Information. Bar
diagrams of the specific capacity of the RTC-300 and RTC-500 electrode
materials with the contribution of the EDLC (red) and PC (blue) are
displayed in Figure 5f. RTC-300 exhibited a 30.2 and 69.8% capacity derived from the EDLC
and PC contributions while RTC-500 delivered a 11.6 and 88.4% capacity
derived from the EDLC and PC contributions, respectively. High-temperature
activation of RTC-500 leads to the removal of activated carbon and
the presence of more Fe3O4 for the reason of
PC contributing more than EDLC. In the case of RTC-300, the combination
of nonfaradaic and faradaic processes helps enhance electrochemical
activities for the charge storage.28,29

The
typical CD profiles of RTC-300 and RTC-500 electrode materials
at a constant current density of 3 A/g are shown Figure 6a. The specific capacitance
of the electrode material was calculated from the discharge profile
(eq 1 in the Supporting Information). RTC-300
and RTC-500 exhibited high specific capacitances of 536 and 323 F/g
at a current density of 3 A/g, respectively. The CD profile of RTC-300
(Figure 6b) and RTC-500
(Figure 6c) electrodes
at different current densities shows a typical nonlinear profile corresponding
to the faradaic nature, which confirms the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles.20 The specific
capacitance of the electrode material was calculated from the discharge
profile, and RTC-300 exhibited specific capacitances of 536, 465,
397, 354, 255, and 175 F/g at current densities of 3, 4, 5, 6, 10,
and 20 A/g, respectively. Similarly, RTC-500 exhibited specific capacitances
of 323, 273, 249, 221, 151, and 79 F/g at current densities of 3,
4, 5, 6, 10, and 20 A/g, respectively. When the current density was
increased up to 20 A/g, RTC-300 exhibited a high rate performance
of 36%, which is higher than that of the RTC-500 (24%) (Figure 6d). The high specific capacitance
of the RTC-300 electrode is better than that of the commercial MGCB
materials (Figure S4). Moreover, there
is no obvious internal resistance (iR drop) that could be observed
in the charge–discharge profile, which indicates the good electrical
conductivity of RTC-300 due to the synergistic effect of carbon and
Fe3O4 nanoparticles. This combination of nonfaradaic
and faradaic materials with a high electrical conductivity might be
enhanced by the charge transfer reaction at the electrode–electrolyte
interface for the fast surface reaction.30,31 The long-term electrochemical stability of the electrode materials
is a key for viable applications. In order to check the electrochemical
stability of the RTC-300 electrode materials, CD cycles were carried
out for 5,000 charge–discharge cycles at a high current density
of 20 A/g (Figure 6e). The capacitance retention of 97% was found and retained
a constant Coulombic efficiency of 99% for 5,000 charge–discharge
cycles, which reveals the high reversibility of the electrode materials
during the electrochemical process.

RTC-300 electrode materials as a function of cycle number, first and
last few charge–discharge cycles (inset), and (f) Nyquist plot
of RTC-300 with corresponding equivalent circuit (inset).

To understand the charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte
interface of RTC-300 and the resistance associated with the diffusion
of charge carriers, EIS was performed, and the resulting Nyquist plot
is shown in Figure 6f. The EIS profile was fitted with a corresponding equivalent circuit,
which consists of various R and C components (Figure 6f, inset). The Nyquist plot of RTC-300 showed a bulk
resistance or solution resistance of Rs = 0.4 Ω, and the semicircle appeared in the high-frequency
region due to the combination of charge-transfer resistance (Rct = 0.6 Ω) and the double layer capacitance
(Cdl). The observed straight line is more
vertical in the low-frequency region and has a smaller imaginary part,
indicating the low diffusion resistance (Warburg impedance, W).32 Additionally, the presence
of a pseudocapacitive component (CF) is
due to the electrochemical faradaic nature of Fe3O4 in alkali medium.33 The low Rs and Rct and the
combination of nonfaradaic and faradaic processes help enhance electrochemical
activities with a good charge-transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte
interface.

Nowadays, activated carbon-based electrode materials
are widely
used as electrode materials for supercapacitors with nonaqueous-based
expensive organic and ionic liquid electrolytes.2,30,34 While supercapacitors have momentous advantages
like high power, high electrochemical stability, and wider operating
temperature, it has some disadvantages such as low energy density
and high cost that limit them as an alternative for conventional energy
storage devices.35 A supercapacitor with
high cell voltage, high energy, high power density, and low cost is
required for future modern energy technology. Thus, supercapacitor
performance studies at the cell or device level are highly essential
for commercial applications. For the full-cell fabrication, the symmetric
supercapacitor cell is fabricated with RTC-300 electrodes in aqueous
3.5 M KOH as the electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the
fabricated symmetric cell was evaluated using CV and CD analyses. Figure 7a reveals the CV
profile of a fabricated symmetric supercapacitor with a cell voltage
of 1.8 V at different scan rates. The nonsymmetrical shape of the
CV profiles with a set of redox peaks at all the scan rates clearly
confirms the contribution of faradaic capacitance from Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

Figure 7 (a) CV profile of the fabricated RTC-300 symmetric
cell at different
scan rates, (b) CD profile of the fabricated RTC-300 symmetric cell
at different current densities, (c) specific capacitance and Coulombic
efficiency of the fabricated RTC-300 symmetric cell as a function
of cycle number, and (d) Ragone plot for the fabricated RTC-300 symmetric
cell.

The calculated specific capacitances
of the symmetric supercapacitor
cell from the discharge profile (Figure 7b) are 368, 256, 200, 164, 140,
80, and 68 F/g at current densities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 20 A/g,
respectively. At a high current density of 20 A/g, the CD analysis
was carried out for 20,000 charge–discharge cycles (Figure 7c), and after 20,000
charge–discharge cycles, 87% of the initial capacitance was
retained. Also, a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% was maintained
for 20,000 charge–discharge cycles, which reveals the high
reversibility of the electrode materials during the electrochemical
charge–discharge process. To the best of our knowledge, this
is one of the best values and stable electrodes among the reported
aqueous supercapacitors (Table S2).

The real performance of a supercapacitor is evaluated in terms
of energy and power density of the fabricated devices. The typical
Ragone plot of a symmetric supercapacitor cell with a cell voltage
of 1.8 V clearly indicates that the fabricated device has a wide range
of energy and power densities (Figure 7d). The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor cell exhibited
a remarkable high energy and power density of 42 W h/kg and 900 W/kg
at 1 A/g current density, respectively. Even at a high current density
of 20 A/g, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor cell delivered
a high energy density of 5.3 W h/kg with a high power density 14.5
kW/kg. It could be clearly seen from the Ragone plot that the symmetric
supercapacitor cell can provide a high energy density without sacrificing
much the power density. The above-observed high energy and power densities
are significantly higher than the reported values for carbon-based
nanocomposite materials in symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors
using aqueous electrolyte. For instance, Saha et al. reported a hydrothermal
method for the preparation of Fe3O4/RGO nanocomposite
for a supercapacitor that exhibited a high energy and power density
of 39.1 W h/kg and 1800 W/kg, respectively.36 Lim et al. reported hydrothermally derived porous 3D carbon-decorated
Fe3O4 nanocomposite electrode materials that
exhibited a high energy and power density of 29.2 W h/kg and 1.2 kW/kg,
respectively.37 Also, some Fe3O4-based nanocomposites like graphene/Fe3O4 nanocomposites (9 W h/kg and 3 kW/kg)38 and Fe3O4/carbon nanotube/polyaniline
ternary films (28 W h/kg and 5.3 kW/kg)19 delivered lower energy density than the RTC-300 symmetric cell.

3 Conclusions
Altogether, ∼6000 tons of carbon
powder is ejected into
the atmosphere in the form of waste toner powder every year that is
essentially polluting the atmosphere. Here, one-step thermal conversion
of waste toner powder into carbon/Fe3O4 nanocomposites
was demonstrated for energy storage applications. The prepared RTC-300
exhibited a high specific capacitance of 536 F/g at a current density
of 3 A/g with an excellent electrochemical stability of 97% for 5000
cycles. The fabricated symmetric cell in aqueous electrolyte with
a cell voltage of 1.8 V delivered a high energy and high power density
of 42 W h/kg and 14.5 kW/kg, respectively. The fabricated device is
stable up to 20,000 cycles at a current density of 20 A/g with a loss
of 23% of the initial capacitance.

12A) are collected from the e-waste accumulated at our office. Activated
conductive carbon (mesoporous graphitized carbon black, 99.95%), poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF), and potassium hydroxide pellets (KOH, 98 wt %) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99 wt %) was purchased from SRL Pvt. Ltd., India. Graphite

4.2 Preparation of Carbon/Fe3O4 Nanocomposite
Here, we demonstrated a one-step thermal
conversion of toner powder at 300 °C into carbon/Fe3O4 nanocomposites for symmetric supercapacitor applications.
In detail, the print toner cartridge (model no. HP LaserJet 12A) was
recovered and dismantled to get residual toner, plastic, metal, and
so on, with proper safety precautions. The residual toner powder was
taken out and named recovered toner carbon (RTC). The RTC was kept
in a furnace at 300 °C for 3 h. After the thermal decomposition
of RTC, the recovered material was washed with water several times
and named RTC-300 for further discussion. For the comparison analysis,
RTC was heated at 500 °C for 3 h, and the obtained material is
named RTC-500. The detailed material characterization and preparations
of electrode materials and related specific capacitance, energy density,
and power density calculations are discussed in the Supporting Information.
