Current
standard of care for treating infected dental pulp, root
canal therapy, retains the physical properties of the tooth to a large
extent, but does not aim to rejuvenate the pulp tissue. Tissue-engineered
acellular biomimetic hydrogels have great potential to facilitate
the regeneration of the tissue through the recruitment of autologous
stem cells. We propose the use of a dentinogenic peptide that self-assembles
into β-sheet-based nanofibers that constitute a biodegradable
and injectable hydrogel for support of dental pulp stem cells. The
peptide backbone contains a β-sheet-forming segment and a matrix
extracellular phosphoglycoprotein mimic sequence at the C-terminus.
The high epitope presentation of the functional moiety in the self-assembled
nanofibers may enable recapitulation of a functional niche for the
survival and proliferation of autologous cells. We elucidated the
hierarchical self-assembly of the peptide through biophysical techniques,
including scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.
The material property of the self-assembled hydrogel was probed though
oscillatory rheometry, demonstrating its thixotropic nature. We also
demonstrate the cytocompatibility of the hydrogel with respect to
fibroblasts and dental pulp stem cells. The self-assembled peptide
platform holds promise for guided dentinogenesis and it can be tailored
to a variety of applications in soft tissue engineering and translational
medicine in the future.

Introduction
Ninety-one percent of adults in the United
States between the ages
of 20 and 64 have caries in their nondeciduous teeth due to factors
such as bacterial infection and physical injury.1 Normally, these dental cavities can be treated with routine
restorative procedures. However, in the cases of severe caries, the
entire dental pulp may be infected and cannot be preserved.2 Currently, the standard treatment in these circumstances
is to completely extirpate the infected pulp, disinfect the root canal,
and fill it with elastomeric materials (such as gutta percha). This
root canal therapy results in a devitalized tooth that is devoid of
a cellular niche or vasculature.2 The elastomeric
materials cannot intrinsically prevent recontamination, for example,
bacterial colonies can extend into apical tissues through apical foramen,
resulting in apical periodontitis.

Deterioration of enamel and
dentin in the damaged teeth may lead
to formation of fibrin-based clots in the dental cavities. These clots
readily resorb in less than 3 days, leaving cavities that remain dormant
till future insult. Regeneration of pulplike tissue in these cavities
after clinical extirpation is extremely consequential for regenerative
endodontics. Unguided regeneration of periapical tissue distinct from
pulp, mediated by a fibrin scaffold with entrapped platelets and red
blood cells, was achieved over 50 years ago.3−5 Next generation
scaffolds attempted in situ pulp regeneration with biologically or
synthetically derived materials, such as collagen matrices and other
hydrogels.5 However, hypoxia, necrosis,
and the essential lack of a physical support have limited these potential
therapeutic approaches thus far. Concerns with cell source and off-the-shelf
availability of cell-loaded constructs have hindered cell-based therapies.
Despite the investigation of several promising therapeutic avenues
in the last few decades, no therapies for regeneration of dental pulp
tissue have been approved by the FDA to date.6−9

Introduction of a slowly
degrading biomaterial that fosters cellular
ingrowth without fibrous encapsulation is a key requirement for viable
tissue regeneration. As cells proliferate, scaffolds need to provide
a niche that is not only conducive to extracellular matrix (ECM) production
and deposition but is also potentially instructive to determine the
phenotype of infiltrating cells. The infiltration of stem cells into
ECM-mimetic nanofibrous scaffolds and directed differentiation into
dentin-producing cells may enhance vital pulplike tissue regeneration.
We hypothesize that instructive cues within scaffolds may promote
infiltration of autologous stem cells from surrounding tissues and
their niche-specific differentiation.

Peptide Design and Nanofibrous
Self-Assembly
Postnatal dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) differentiate
into odontoblast-like
cells during pulp injury, which are believed to play a crucial role
in forming reparative dentin. Liu et al. reported that dentonin, a
bioactive portion of matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE),
has a potential role in pulp repair via its ability to promote DPSC
proliferation.10 Six et al. postulated
from their research that the initial cascade of events leading to
pulp healing are primarily affected by this bioactive portion.11 Dentonin (TDLQERGDNDISPFSGDGQPFKD) possesses both the RGD integrin-binding motif
and the SGDG glycosaminoglycan-binding motif of MEPE. Researchers
have shown that both of these motifs are required for bioactivity,
and thus dentonin has the potential to assist the survival of injured
pulp. In this work, we will explore the attachment of dentonin to
a self-assemble peptide framework for possible therapeutic application
(Table 1).

Table 1 Peptide Sequences Studied in This
Articlea
a All sequences are
N-terminally acetylated
and C-terminally amidated. (A) Dentonin, a MEPE mimic, is highlighted
in green in the sequence of the main therapeutic candidate, SLd. (B)
SLdmod is a control sequence with similar polarity to SLd
but contains an altered primary sequence (changed amino acids shown
in red). (C) Both peptides are based on the sequence of SL-base, which
has a sequence similar to a previously characterized self-assembling
peptide.12−14

Self-assembling
peptide hydrogels (SAPHs) are created from multidomain
peptides, which have 12–50 amino acid primary sequences with
repeating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues and can be triggered
to self-assemble in aqueous solution to form nanofibers with β-sheet
secondary structure.9,15−18 Self-assembly is mediated by
bonds that break and reassemble reversibly: hydrogen bonding, van
der Waals interactions, and ionic interactions. These afford thixotropic
rheological properties: rapid shear thinning and shear recovery.9,17 Therefore, these hydrogels can be easily syringe aspirated, injected,
and reassembled in situ to provide a prolonged, sustained biological
response. The general self-assembly platform has been evaluated for
drug delivery, angiogenesis, inflammation modulation, and recovery
from ischemic tissue disease.16−20 At the ultrastructural level, these peptides self-assemble into
biomimetic nanofibers. The nanofibrous architecture is crucial for
supporting cells in vivo, and the presentation of bioactive domains
on such nanofibers have been shown to be instructive for infiltrating
cells.17,21 Rational design of these injectable ECM-mimetic
scaffolds may be directed toward facilitating infiltration and phenotypic
modulation of surrounding cells.18,22 For example,
a mimic of vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF-165) was engineered
into a similar β-sheet-forming peptide sequence for promoting
robust angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.17,20 These hydrogels have shown rapid improvement in reperfusion of ischemic
limbs in mice with femoral artery ligation.20

Thus, attachment of a functional bioactive mimic to the SAPH
platform
may potentially lead to biological and physical properties required
for tissue remodeling and regeneration. In this article, we explore
the use of dentonin to modify the sequence of a parent SAPH system
(SL-base, Table 1)
to design a new hybrid peptide, SLd, to achieve a dentinogenic outcome
(Table 1). The functionalized
peptide is expected to form β-sheet-based nanofibers (Scheme 1A–C) and indeed
forms a stable hydrogel in aqueous solution (Scheme 1D,E), indicating the possibility of nanofibers
as constituents. However, we need further biophysical characterization
to prove the self-assembly of nanofibers. To determine the importance
of the functional domain (dentonin), we designed a control peptide
(SLdmod, Table 1) with a similar polarity to SLd, but containing an altered
sequence. A crucial aspect of the design is that the dentonin functionality
is displayed at the edge of the nanofiber at a high epitope density,
enable facile signaling mechanism similar to MEPE.

Scheme 1 Peptide Self-Assembly
and Gross Hydrogel Structure
(A–C) The base
sequence
has alternative hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues. In aqueous media,
the hydrophobic leucine residues collapse into a core, exposing the
hydrophilic serine residues to the surface. Stacking of a tetrameric
unit to maximize hydrogen bonding leads to the formation of a β-sheet
nanofiber. The lengthening and crosslinking of the nanofibers is favored
in physiological salt concentrations as the repulsion among the positively
charged lysine residues is shielded, leading to (D, E) the formation
of robust hydrogels that maintain their shape.

Results
and Discussion
Around 15 million root canal procedures are
completed in the US
every year. The infected pulp is removed and replaced with inert elastomeric
materials, such as gutta percha. The resulting devitalized tooth does
not have any regenerative potential. The current exploratory pulp-capping
treatments (calcium hydroxide, mineral trioxide aggregate, biodentine,
etc.) do not offer a solution to this fundamental problem.23 Here, we propose the use of regenerative peptide
scaffolds as a potential therapeutic solution (Scheme 2). There are multiple challenges in designing
such biomaterials. For example, (a) the material needs to be easily
deliverable to the targeted tissue niche. Moreover, (b) the hydrogel
or scaffold should be nontoxic and should be able to support autologous
cells in the pulpal niche. Another important criterion is (c) a proper
biodegradability profile: rapid degradation of the material may limit
support of autologous cells in vivo for the required regeneration
and very slow degradation may hinder the gradual replacement of the
construct by the native deposited matrix. In this article, we report
significant advancement toward the first two goals.

Scheme 2 Injectable Peptide
Scaffolds for Pulpal Regeneration
The
dental cavity may contain
bacterial colonies that need to be extirpated (partial or complete
pulpotomy). After clinical extirpation, the void may be filled with
the thixotropic peptide hydrogel with dentinogenic activity. As the
hydrogel promptly recovers after shear thinning, it should reassemble
into a viscoelastic scaffold, filling the void. Recruitment and differentiation
of autologous stem cells may then lead to re-establishment of a pulplike
tissue niche.

Self-Assembly
The target peptide
with the dentonin
functional moiety, SLd (Table 1), was dissolved in 298 mM sucrose and combined with a molar
equivalent of calcium chloride (CaCl2). Consistent with
the self-assembly scenario in Scheme 1, SLd forms a robust hydrogel. The ultrastructure of
the hydrogel was determined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 1). Critical point-dried samples of SLd show
a nanofibrous meshlike morphology in SEM. In terms of fiber density
and alignment, these nanofibers are comparable to self-assembled peptides
reported before.17 Through AFM, we determined
the height (∼2 nm) and width (∼14 nm) of these ribbonlike
nanofibers, which is again consistent with the ribbonlike self-assembly,
depicted in Scheme 1.

Figure 1 Ultrastructure of the hydrogel formed by SLd. Critical point-dried
hydrogel samples in SEM show formation of a dense nanofibrous network
with nanoscale pores (A) at low magnification (50k×) and (B)
at high magnification (200k×). (C, D) Drop-cast samples of diluted
SLd on two-dimensional mica disks show characteristic nanofibrous
structure with individual fibers visible in peak force AFM. Measurement
of fiber dimensions showed a width of ∼14 nm and a height of
∼2 nm, which is consistent with the proposed self-assembly
scenario in Scheme 1.

Viscoelasticity
Through oscillatory rheometry, we determined
that the viscoelastic properties of the SLd hydrogel (G′ > 100 Pa) (Figure 2) are comparable in magnitude to similar self-assembled peptide
hydrogels.17,18 Crucially, the hydrogel undergoes
liquefaction under shear force and immediately recovers its storage
modulus when the force is removed. Quantitatively, when the hydrogel
experiences high shear strain (100% strain), the storage modulus (G′) of the hydrogel drops from ∼400 to ∼10
Pa, essentially indicating the liquefaction of the gel. When the shear
strain is lowered to 1%, the G′ of the hydrogel
almost instantaneously recovers to ∼400 Pa (Figure 2B). The result can be explained
by the noncovalent aspect of the interactions that drive the self-assembly
of the nanofibers and the hydrogel. The nanofibrous network that is
disrupted by the shear strain can reform when the strain is removed
(by reassembly of the hydrogen bond network facilitated by hydrophobic
interaction at the nanofiber core), essentially recapitulating the
material properties of the nanofibrous mesh. This thixotropic property
ensures the injectability of the hydrogel, which meets the requirement
of being minimally invasive and easily deliverable. The thixotropic
property of the hydrogel is important for formulating a noninvasive
protocol to administer the gel to its targeted niche (the dental cavity).

Figure 2 Rheological
characterization of hydrogels to demonstrate thixotropy
and injectability. (A) Strain sweep of peptide hydrogels show a relatively
high storage modulus (G′) of about 400 Pa,
which is decimated above ∼10% strain. At this point the values
for G″ exceed G′ indicating
liquefaction. (B) Hydrogels are allowed to equilibrate at a constant
frequency of 1 Hz and 1% strain rate. As the strain is instantaneously
increased to 100%, inversions of G′ and G″ occur suggesting instantaneous liquefaction of
the gel. Interestingly, after removing the high deformation strain,
100% of the storage modulus is recovered within 3 s. (C) This is evident
while pipetting the gel onto the rheometer stage where instantaneous
gelation leaves a nubbin suspended with its reflection visible.

Primary and Secondary Structure
Electrospray ionization
mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) (Figure 3) confirms the identity of the peptide SLd following
solid-phase peptide synthesis. The secondary structure of the peptide
hydrogel is determined through attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
(Figure 3). The FTIR
peak at 1625 cm–1 is a signature peak of the amide
I band specific to the β-sheet secondary structure and is consistent
with the self-assembly scenario depicted in Scheme 1 as well as prior investigations on similar
systems.9,15,17 The CD spectrum,
on the other hand, bears the signature β-sheet maximum at 195
nm and minimum at 217 nm.

Figure 3 Spectroscopic characterization of the dentinogenic
hybrid peptide.
(A) Characterization of SLd via mass spectroscopy shows expected [M
+ 3H]3+ and [M + 4H]4+ peaks at 1365 and 1024
Da, consistent with the molecular weight (4095 Da). (B) The FTIR spectrum
demonstrates the characteristic β-sheet signature peak at 1625
cm–1. (C) Circular dichroism spectrum contains a
minimum at 217 nm, which is specific to a β-sheet secondary
structure.

In Vitro Cytocompatibility
and Efficacy
An important
first step to evaluate the utility of materials is to determine the
cytocompatibility of scaffolds. Fibroblasts were chosen because they
are one of the primary cell types found in the dental pulp.2 We note that SLd scaffolds, regardless of formulation
(Figure 4A), show excellent
cytocompatibility when compared to media-only and formulation-only
(sucrose) controls (Figure 4C,D), over concentrations ranging in 2 orders of magnitude
(0.004–0.4 wt %, p < 0.01) (Figure 4E–G). We also show the
utility of our conjugation strategy in preserving the proliferative
functionality of MEPE, as adult DPSCs proliferate significantly more
in response to SLd compared to the control peptide, p < 0.01, (Figure 4B). We have shown that we are able to sustain the viability of fibroblasts
and the proliferation of DPSCs in the biodegradable hydrogel that
was significantly better than a control (Figure 4). The hydrogel demonstrates a conclusive
lack of cytotoxicity in an in vitro environment. Furthermore, injections
performed subcutaneously in rats suggest high cytocompatibility in
an in vivo environment (data not shown) as well as full degradation
within 3 days post-implantation (data not shown). We attribute the
lack of toxicity to the lack of non-native polymers after degradation
and note that similar peptide backbones have been used in the past
for tissue regeneration with no record of toxicity.17,20 The SLd hydrogel that we have developed fulfills our goal of a scaffold
that is both nontoxic and encourages DPSC proliferation.

Figure 4 Cytocompatibility
and DPSC proliferation. (A) Viability of fibroblasts
cultured with SLd at different concentrations (0.004–0.4 wt
% w/v), media with formulation solution (298 mM sucrose), or media-only
are shown along with their representative live/dead images (C–G).
(B) Dental pulp stem cells demonstrated stronger proliferation (CCK-8)
compared to no treatment of 0.004 wt % SLd or treatment with a modified
variant (SLdmod) with similar charge density (n = 8, *p < 0.01). Scale bar (C–G): 200
μm.

DPSC cultures with SLd show appreciable
calcium phosphate deposition
compared to their absence in control populations (Figure 5). This demonstrates the ability
for the dentonin mimic to stimulate expected biochemical signaling
to induce DPSC proliferation and facilitate calcium deposition, essential
for robust dentin production. In formulation with CaCl2, SLd self-assembles into signaling platforms for primary DPSC proliferation
and robust secondary calcium phosphate deposition. Dentonin additionally
has cell adhesion domains with the potential for in vivo recruitment
of autologous cells to remodel and deposit biomimetic mineralized
matrix.10

Figure 5 Calcium phosphate deposition in response
to SLd treatment of DPSCs
(representative regions from independent cultures). SLd hydrogel shows
appreciable red staining either alone or in combination with poly-l-lysine (PLL) compared to media-only controls. The addition
of Ca2+ to the SLd formulation results in significantly
more observable calcium phosphate deposition, as observed with Alizarin
red staining.

In summary, while preserving
biomimetic nanofibrous architecture
(Figure 1), injectability
(Figure 2), and secondary
structure (Figure 3), the SAPH platform can be modified with bioactive functionality
and maintain cytocompatibility (Figures 4 and 5). We demonstrated
in vitro that the peptide SLd can self-assemble to form antiparallel
β-sheets that stack to form ribbonlike nanofibers (∼14
nm wide and ∼2 nm high). Noncovalent crosslinking of these
nanofibers leads to formation of a robust injectable hydrogel that
retains its bioactivity similarly to previous work targeting angiogenesis
and immune modulation.17,18,20,22 Such a platform-app model is especially
attractive for β-sheet nanofibers as the functional groups are
displayed at a high epitope density along the edge of the nanofiber,
which has been shown to be crucial for the bioactivity of similar
self-assembled platforms.21,24

However, a major
drawback of the current construct (SLd) is rapid
biodegradation (in vivo), limiting its potential for dental pulp regeneration
in its current form. Subcutaneous evaluation of implants in Wistar
rats showed rapid degradation over a 1 week period, leaving tissue
undiscernible from native cuticular fascia (n = 4,
data not shown). Short term (3 days) and long-term (1 week) implants
showed similar rapid degradation, which motivated peptide design modification
outline in the discussion below. As the next step toward translation,
we aim to develop optimized scaffolds that resist degradation for
at least 2 weeks.

However, we note the significant stride we
made in this study toward
supporting dental pulp stem cells in an injectable scaffold, paving
the way for a minimally invasive treatment route. For tuning the biodegradation
profile, we are currently exploring several modifications to increase
the stability of hydrogels in vivo, for example, through insertion
of d-amino acids or by increasing the hydrophobicity of the
hydrogel. We are currently exploring the modification of the backbone
to reduce its susceptibility to matrix metalloproteases by lengthening
the SL repeats of the backbone and by altering the charge and polarity
of the nanofibers. Finally, peptide hydrogels with similar sequences
that have shown to persist in vivo for long term (>2 weeks) can
be
combined with SLd to manipulate the degradation characteristics and
provide prolonged therapeutic function. Another aspect of the regenerative
hydrogel we would like to optimize is the ability of the construct
to direct angiogenesis from the apical tissue, this would ensure the
supply of oxygen and nutrients to the newly developing tissue and
prevent the formation of a necrotic core.17,20 The success of our therapeutic approach would enable the possibility
of a regenerative replacement for dental pulp.

Conclusions and
Outlook
The ability to regenerate the dental pulp is a critical
breakthrough
required to preserve the vitality of teeth following root canal therapies.
In this study, we engineered a minimally invasive injectable peptide
scaffold and demonstrate the feasibility of this functionalized self-assembled
platform to support dental pulp stem cells and stromal cells in a
biomimetic hydrogel environment. Specifically, we demonstrate the
injectable properties crucial for clinical application, and we show
the potential of SLd to support proliferation of DPSCs and increase
calcium phosphate deposition while also exhibiting cytocompatibility
to other critical stromal cells found in the dental pulp. The results
demonstrate the first steps in improving the standard of care for
root canal therapies. The next step in peptide modification would
be aimed at tuning the biodegradability of the hydrogels in vivo.
We will optimize the SAPH system for in vivo disease models (partial
pulpotomy in dog models) to further showcase the viability of such
a biomimetic tissue regeneration approach. Replacement of inert seals
in dental cavities with an engineered bioresponsive matrix to promote
vital pulplike tissue regeneration would be a major step forward for
nanomedicine and dental tissue engineering.

Experimental Section
Peptide
Synthesis and Preparation
The peptides described
in Table 1 were synthesized
using a solid-phase peptide synthesis protocol modified from methods
previously published with acetyl N-terminal and amide C-terminal protective
groups.15,17,20 All amino
acids, resin, and coupling reagents were purchased from CEM Corporation.
Standard solid-phase peptide synthesis was performed using a CEM Liberty
Blue microwave peptide synthesizer and Rink amide resin with 0.18
mmol/g loading. Following synthesis, each peptide was cleaved from
the resin and the crude mass was checked prior to dialysis against
deionized water with 2000 Da molecular weight cut-off dialysis tubing
(Cole-Parmer). The peptides were then lyophilized, and their purity
was measured using electron-spray ionization mass spectrometry (Bruker
Instruments). Peptides were reconstituted in sterile 298 mM sucrose
solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and gelation of the peptides into thixotropic
hydrogels was performed by the addition of a molar equivalent of calcium
chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) to balance the overall negative charge of
the peptides.

Peptide Characterization
Scanning
electron microscopy
(SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), rheology, and Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed as previously described.15,17,18,20,22 For SEM, hydrogel samples were fixed in
glutaraldehyde, ethanol dehydrated, critical point dried, sputter
coated with gold/palladium, and imaged on a field emission SEM (LEO
1530VP). For AFM, the peptide solutions (0.01–0.05 wt %) were
spin-coated onto clean mica disks. Images were collected on a Dimension
Icon AFM (Bruker Instruments) in ScanAsyst mode. For rheology, 4 wt
% solution of peptide hydrogel was transferred onto an 8 mm parallel
plate geometry with a gap of 250 μm. Strain sweep (0–1000%
strain at 1 Hz) and shear recovery (1% strain at 1 Hz for 20 s, 100%
strain at 1 Hz for 60 s, and 1% strain at 1 Hz for 120 s) were performed
using an ARES-G2 rheometer (TA Instruments). For FTIR, the peptide
solutions (0.04 wt %) were pipetted onto a universal attenuated total
reflectance accessory and dried until a thin film of peptide was achieved.
Infrared spectrum was taken using a Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer
(PerkinElmer). For circular dichroism, we used an Olis Rapid Scanning
Monochromator to measure the ellipticity of a 0.004% peptide solution
from 190 to 250 nm in a 1 cm cuvette. The ellipticity (θ, measured
in millidegrees) was converted to molar residual ellipticity (θ)
according to the formula: (θ) = (θ·m)/(10·cln), where m is the
molecular weight of the peptide, c is the concentration
of the peptide solution in mg/mL, l is the path length
of the cuvette in centimeter, and n is the no. of
residues in the peptide sequence (similar to calculations described
before).25

In Vitro Cytocompatibility
All reagents and materials
were purchased from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise noted. Mouse
3T3 fibroblasts (NIH) were cultured in media (Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% 100×
penicillin streptomycin) in T75 flasks. Media was changed every 3
days until the fibroblasts reached confluency. For cytocompatibility
studies, fibroblasts were seeded in a 96-well plate (5000 cells/well).
Three conditions (0.4, 0.04, and 0.004 wt % SLd; n = 6) and two controls (media with sucrose and media alone; n = 6) were tested. For each condition, the specified amount
of peptide was supplemented in the media, and for the media control
with sucrose, 298 mM sucrose was supplemented to the media corresponding
to the amount added to the tested conditions. Media was changed daily
and cytocompatibility was assessed on day 3 using a LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity
kit. Images were taken on an Eclipse Ti-S inverted microscope (Nikon
Instruments). Cell viability was quantified using ImageJ (NIH).

In Vitro Proliferation and Efficacy
DPSCs (Lonza) were
cultured using a DPSC BulletKit (Lonza) in T75 flasks. Media was changed
every 3 days. For the proliferation assay, cells were seeded into
96-well plates (5000 cells/well). Media and 0.004 wt % SLdmod were used as controls (n = 8), whereas the tested
condition contained 0.004 wt % SLd (n = 8). Media
was changed daily and proliferation was evaluated on day 3 using the
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo). Using an Infinite m200 PRO plate
reader (Tecan) with the temperature set to 37 °C, initial absorbance
was measured at 450 nm (reference wavelength: 650 nm). For the calcium
deposition assay, DPSCs were seeded in 96-well plates (5000 cells/well)
with n = 3 for each condition. Three conditions were
tested (0.04, 0.04 wt % SLd with ε-poly-l-lysine (PLL,
Carbosynth), and 0.04 wt % SLd with Ca2+) against a control
without SLd. Conditions with PLL and Ca2+ had equal molar
equivalents added to balance the overall charge of the peptide. Cells
were cultured in differentiation media (proliferation media supplemented
with 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid, 10 nM dexamethasone, and 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate) for 2 weeks. Cells were stained with Alizarin
Red S (Sigma-Aldrich) on day 14 and imaged with an Eclipse Ti-S inverted
microscope to observe calcium deposition.

In Vivo Subcutaneous Implantation
All animal studies
were approved by the NJIT-Rutgers animal care and use committee. Female
Wistar rats (225–250 g, Charles River Labs) were prepped and
injected subcutaneously in the dorsal region with 200 μL of
peptide hydrogel, with each rat receiving a total of four implants
(n = 4). At the specified time points (3 day and
1 week), the rats were sacrificed and regions around the implant were
excised, fixed, and processed for routine histological staining.

Statistical Analysis
Results are presented as mean
± standard deviation. Comparisons were made using analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons with Tukey post hoc analysis
for parametric data. Nonparametric tests were carried out using the
Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s post hoc analysis.
Statistical significance was accepted for p <
0.01.
