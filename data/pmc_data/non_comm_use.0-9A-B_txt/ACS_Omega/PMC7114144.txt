Density
functional theory calculations with a Hubbard U correction
were used to investigate the selective oxidation of propylene on Cu2O(111) and Cu2O(110) surfaces, and the mechanism
for the selective oxidation of propylene was discussed. On both surfaces,
acrolein can be generated by two H-stripping reactions in the allylic
hydrogen stripping path, while propylene oxide (PO), propanal, and
acetone can be created through the propylene oxametallacycle intermediates
in the epoxidation path. Our calculation results indicated that Cu2O has a high crystal plane-controlled phenomenon for the selective
oxidation of propylene. It was found that the formations of propanal
and acetone are unfavorable kinetically and acrolein is the main product
on the (111) surface. On the (110) surface, the activation barrier
of acrolein formation is too high to produce and PO becomes the favored
product, which is different from the case of the (111) surface. Moreover,
energetic span model analysis was carried out to discuss the selective
oxidation of propylene on these two surfaces and confirm the above
calculations. The present study can help people to design the proper
crystal plane catalyst to get the target product of PO with high selectivity
and activity in the selective oxidation of propylene.

1 Introduction
Propylene
selective oxidation is a significant module in industrial
catalysis1 and the product propylene oxide
(PO) is a crucial feedstock for the manufacture of various commodity
chemicals.2 Traditional chlorohydrin and
organic hydroperoxide methods can either cause serious environmental
pollution or produce large amounts of coproducers.3 A profitable and environmentally friendly route, thus propylene
selective oxidation catalyzed by metals or metal oxides, has received
considerable attention. For example, Zheng and co-workers4 discussed propylene epoxidation using molecular
oxygen by the unsupported Cu and Ag catalysts with different oxidation
states and discovering: (i) the metallic Cu catalyst exhibits much
higher PO selectivity than others, (ii) the Cu0 species
is the main active site for propylene epoxidation, and (iii) cuprous
oxide has better performance than copper oxide on catalytic activity.

Experimentally, some catalysts (Au,5,6 Ag,7,8 Cu,9−12 Cu2O,13,14 and CuO4,15)
have been widely used to study propylene oxidation. Cu-based catalysts
are emerging with a range of functions as the oxidative alkane dehydrogenation,16 catalyzing cyclization reactions17−19 and so on.20−25 Su et al.11 investigated propylene epoxidation
catalyzed by Cu/SiO2 with various promoters using molecular
oxygen, and they announced that both Cu0 and Cu+ species in the Cu/SiO2 catalyst show epoxidation activity
maybe caused by the strong bonding between propylene and Cu0 or Cu+ sites. For propylene oxidation, the metallic Cu
can be easily oxidized to Cu2O and Cu2O is much
stable at 900 K in vacuum with highly catalytic efficiency.15 Therefore, Cu2O was exploited in
the present study for the selective oxidation of propylene. Campbell
discussed ethylene selective epoxidation catalyzed by Ag(111) and
Ag(110) surfaces and proved that the activity of Ag(111) in the epoxidation
route is about half that of Ag(110).26 Schulz
and Cox elucidated propylene oxidation influenced by different single-crystal
facets of Cu2O (Cu+-terminated (100), oxygen-terminated
(100), and (111)), which found that propylene selective oxidation
favors acrolein and promoted with coordinately unsaturated surface
lattice oxygen.13 Hua et al. revealed the
strong crystal plane-controlled selectivity of Cu2O catalysts
in propylene oxidation in which the (110) facet has the highest selectivity
of PO and the (111) facet favors acrolein formation.14

Theoretical calculations provide an indispensable
and special view
to study the catalytic activity. Theoretically, Torres et al. indicated
that PO and propanal can be generated by propylene selective epoxidation
through a metallacycle intermediate and the lower basicity of Cu favors
epoxide formation than Ag.27 Pulido et
al. discussed the aerobic epoxidation mechanism of propylene over
Ag(111) and (100) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
which confirms that propylene epoxidation can also form acetone through
the propylene oxametallacycle (OMP) intermediates.28 Besides, the allylic hydrogen stripping (AHS) route of
propylene has been illustrated by Lei et al. with a subnanometer size
Ag nanoparticles on alumina supports.29 Düzenli et al. studied propylene epoxidation within the mechanism
over Cu2O(001) and CuO(001) surfaces, which revealed that
acrolein is more favorable thermally on both facets and Cu+ species has higher activity.30 For the
copper-based catalysts, the DFT calculations confirmed that the CuO(110)
facet is more active for PO formation than the CuO(111) facet31 and the magnetic properties can be affected
by the surface of Cu2O.32 Considering
the structure sensitivity and higher selectivity of PO formation over
Cu2O as compared to that of CuO,4 hence, propylene selective oxidation on Cu2O(111) and
the results would be discussed in this study compared to the Cu2O(110). The related propylene oxidation mechanism is proposed
in Scheme 1 based on
theoretical works.29−31,33−39 The role of oxygen species on the Cu2O(111) facet is
a key factor in the catalysis40,41 and different kinds
of oxygen in the selective oxidation of propylene on Cu2O(111) have been studied in our previous work.42 The aim of this work is to investigate the roles and effects
of different facets of Cu2O on the selective oxidation
of propylene.

Scheme 1 Reaction Scheme for the Selective Oxidation of Propylene
on Cu2O(111) and Cu2O(110) Surfaces
2 Calculation Methods and Models
2.1 Calculation Methods
The spin-polarized
version of Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP)43,44 coupled with the DFT + U method45−47 was performed. The projector-augmented
wave (PAW)48,49 was used to describe the valence
electron and inner core interactions, and the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) with a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange–correlation functional50 was carried out. The electronic states were expanded in a plane-wave
basis with a kinetic cutoff energy being 400 eV, and the value of
(U-J) being 3.6 eV was selected to evaluate the on-site Coulomb interactions
in the localized d orbital.51−53 The Brillouin zone sampling was
performed using a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh.54 The climbing image general nudged elastic band
method developed by Jónsson et al. was approached to calculate
the transition state (TS),55,56 and the TS was confirmed
by vibrational frequency analysis. The van der Waals correction was
implemented for the weak interaction with the catalyst using the DFT-PBE-D3
method.57,58 Moreover, we were dealing with the surface
with a large dipole under periodic boundary conditions, although polarization
corrections have been taken into account. The adsorption energy (Eads), activation energy (Ea), and reaction energy (ΔE) are calculated
by the following formulas: Eads = Eadsorbate/substrate – Eadsorbate – Esubstrate, Ea = ETS – EIS, and ΔE = EFS – EIS, where Eadsorbate/substrate, Eadsorbate, Esubstrate, ETS, EIS, and EFS represent the energies of the
adsorption system, adsorbate, substrate, TS, initial state (IS), and
final state (FS), respectively.

2.2 Model
Selection
Aiming at clarifying
the crystal plane-controlled effect of cuprous oxide, a twelve-layer
and a six-layer symmetrically periodic substrates by selecting a p
(2 × 2) unit cell were used to model Cu2O(111) and
Cu2O(110) surfaces, respectively (Figure 1). An optimized lattice constant of 4.27
Å was applied in unit cell volume.59 The types were obtained by cleaving the bulk in the 111 and 110
directions with a vacuum region of 18 Å. For Cu2O(111),
the uppermost six layers were relaxed and four different chemical
atoms existed on the surface, which were denoted as Cucus, Cucsa, Osuf, and Osub (Figure 1a). The Cucus is the single-coordinated unsaturated Cu atom, the Cucsa is the two-coordinated saturated Cu atom, the Osuf is
the three-coordinated oxygen atom, and the Osub is the
four-coordinated oxygen atom. For Cu2O(110) bulk, the uppermost
three layers were relaxed and two different chemical atoms existed
on the surface, which were denoted as Cu2f and O3f (Figure 1b). The
Cu2f is a surface copper atom, which binds to two neighboring
oxygen atoms, and the O3f is a surface oxygen atom, which
binds to three neighboring Cu atoms.

copper atom, Cucsa is the two-coordinated copper atom,

Oxidation on Cu2O(111) Surface
The adsorption
properties of IS, intermediates, and FSs for propylene selective oxidation
on Cu2O(111) were investigated first. The optimized adsorption
configurations are exhibited in Figure S1a, and the adsorption energies are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The role of different oxygen
species in the selective oxidation of propylene on Cu2O(111)
was investigated in our previous study,42 and the results would be discussed in this paper compared to the

3.2 Reaction Mechanism of Propylene
Selective
Oxidation on Cu2O(110) Surface
The mechanism of
propylene selective oxidation on Cu2O(110) was studied
through two parallel routes: the AHS route and the epoxidation route.
The first step between absorbed propylene and surface O3f can either create hydroxyl and allyl species or form OMP intermediates.
The optimized adsorption configurations of reactant, intermediates,
and products for propylene selective oxidation on (110) are summarized
in Figure S1b, and the corresponding adsorption
energies are listed in Table S1 in the
Supporting Information. The structures of the TSs are displayed in Figure 2b, and the free-energy
profiles are shown in Figure 3b, separately.

3.2.1 AHS Mechanism
The adsorption of
propylene, allyl, C3H5O, and acrolein in the
AHS route prefers the top site, 1,3-di-σ mode, Cu-three-fold
type, and top site, respectively. The AHS mechanism included two H-stripping
reactions and acrolein can be generated finally. The first step involves
hydrogen abstraction of the methyl group by neighboring O3f forming allyl and hydroxyl groups. This hydrogen abstraction process
is endothermic by 0.11 eV with an activation barrier of 0.65 eV, and
at TS10, the distance of C3–H is 134
pm and the length of O–H is 128 pm, separately. The second
step involves C3 of methylene addition to another neighboring
O3f created C3H5O species through
TS11, where the distance of C–O is 212 pm. Besides,
this process releases 0.34 eV and has a barrier of 0.52 eV. DFT calculations
indicate that the formation of acrolein prefers the second hydrogen
abstraction from C3H5O species to surface O3f. The process of acrolein formation requires 0.43 eV and
the calculated activation barrier at the PBE level is 1.89 eV via
TS12, where the distance of breaking C–H is 141
pm and the length of forming O3f–H is 132 pm. Then,
desorption of acrolein occurs with a barrier of 0.46 eV, and hydroxyl
groups existing on the surface can form water via the diffusion of
hydrogen, ending the AHS reaction. The rate-controlling step for AHS
is the second hydrogen abstraction with a barrier of 1.89 eV.

3.2.2 Epoxidation Mechanism
Propylene,
PO, propanal, and acetone are favored at the top adsorption, and OMP
is absorbed in the 1,2-di-σ mode in the epoxidation path. The
propylene epoxidation reaction can lead to the formation of PO, propanal,
and acetone through two different intermediates. Adsorbed propylene
acted on nearby O3f can create different OMP intermediates.
First, the C1 atom binds to the O3f atom and
the C2 atom connects to the copper atom forming OMP1 geometry, where the length of C1–O3f is 150 pm and the bond of C2–Cu is 203
pm. Second, the C1 atom binds to the copper atom and the
C2 atom connects to the O3f atom, which can
produce OMP2 with a C1–Cu distance of
199 pm and a C2–O3f length of 153 pm.
The generation of OMP1 and OMP2 intermediates
is endothermic by 0.22 and 0.18 eV with the corresponding barriers
of 0.76 and 0.53 eV, respectively. At TS, the distance of C1–O is 193 pm in OMP1 and the length of C2–O is 191 pm in OMP2, separately.

The OMP1 intermediate can generate the final product PO in the epoxidation
route, which involves the breaking of the C2–Cu
bond and the formation of a (−C1OC2−)
cycle. The reaction energy is 0.91 eV with an activation barrier of
1.57 eV, and the length of C2–O at TS15 is 191 pm. Meanwhile, OMP1 can also be oxidized to propanal
by hydrogen shift from C1 to C2 via TS16, where the distance of C1–H is 133 pm and the
length of C2–H is 158 pm. The shift process of hydrogen
is endothermic by 0.11 eV and the calculated barrier is 1.39 eV. Clearly,
the rate-controlling step for PO formation is the step from OMP1 to PO with a barrier of 1.57 eV and it is 1.39 eV for propanal
formation.

The other intermediate OMP2 can form epoxide
PO as well,
where the bond of C1–Cu is broken and the O3f atom connected to the C2 atom is directly binded
to the C1 atom. In this cyclizing process, the formation
of PO requires 0.94 eV with an activation barrier of 1.41 eV and the
length of the forming C1–O3f bond decreases
to 175 pm at the TS17. In this process, the OMP2 → PO step with a barrier of 1.41 eV can be regarded as the
rate-controlling step. Moreover, the OMP2 intermediate
can also produce acetone by hydrogen shift from C2 to C1 and the shift process is exothermic by 0.45 eV. The calculated
barrier for the formation of acetone is 1.62 eV via TS18, where the distance of C2–H is 127 pm and the
length of C1–H is 152 pm. Obviously, the rate-controlling
step is 1.62 eV for acetone formation.

From the above calculation
results, we can find that the main product
of propylene oxidation on the surface of Cu2O(110) might
be propanal and PO, followed by acetone and acrolein if we considered
the rate-controlling step only, and more discussion will be given
in the following section.

3.3 Catalyst
Recovery
Oxygen deficient
can also be formed in propylene selective oxidation on these two surfaces,
and molecular O2 is requisite at experimental conditions
for the catalyst recovery. The lattice oxygen and the absorbed oxygen
can be produced by a molecular O2 moiety bound in the hole
in which the restoration process occurs easily. Then, the absorbed
oxygen with higher activity becomes the oxidant participating in propylene
selective oxidation, which has been discussed partially in our another
paper.42

4 Discussion
4.1 Electronic Analysis for Adsorption
For deeper understanding
the physical origin of why the adsorption
of pertinent species (except C3H5O species)
in propylene selective oxidation on the (111) surface is more favorable
in comparison with the (110) surface, the electronic analysis of these
pertinent species was performed based on the projected crystal orbital
Hamilton population (COHP) method developed by Dronskowski et al.60,61 The positive and negative values correspond to the bonding and antibonding
states in the COHP diagram. As can be seen from Figure S3, the Fermi level lines appear between the bonding
and the antibonding region. It was found that the population of the
bonding region for these pertinent species (except C3H5O species) on the (111) surface is much larger than the (110)
surface. The integrated COHP (ICOHP) relative to the Fermi level could
reflect the orbital interaction between the adsorbate and substrate,
and the more negative value corresponds to the stronger interaction.
The ICOHP values for adsorbate–substrate interaction are exhibited
in Table 1. For C3H5O species, however, the adsorption on the (110)
surface is stronger than that on the (111) surface and can be also
confirmed by COHP analysis. This may be caused by the reason that
the oxygen atom in C3H5O species binds with
the subsurface Cu atom on (110) and the interaction between them is
much stronger (Figure S1b).

Adsorbate and Substrate for Cu2O(111) and Cu2O(110) (eV)

4.2 Free-Energy
Diagrams
Free-energy
diagrams for propylene selective oxidation on Cu2O(111)
and Cu2O(110) surfaces are plotted in Figure 3. The free energies are determined
by considering the entropy contributions of adsorption and desorption.
We assume such contributions from the translational entropy, which
is calculated as the formula:62,63S =
1.5R ln (2πMkBT) – 3R ln h + R ln (kBT/P) + 2.5R, where R, M, kB, T, h, and P are the ideal gas constant, molecular
weight, Boltzmann constant, temperature, Planck constant, and pressure,
respectively. The free-energy values in this method are approximate
to the entropic energy calculated by Campbell and Sellers.64 In the free-energy diagrams, the free energies
are reported at 433 K and 100 kPa to keep in accordance with the experimental
condition.4

For propylene selective
oxidation on (111) depicted in Figure 3a, because of rather high barriers for propanal (2.21
eV) and acetone (2.02 eV) formation, free-energy diagrams of them
are neglected. In the epoxidation path, the barriers of OMP1 and OMP2 formation from absorbed propylene are 1.22 and
0.90 eV and the barrier from OMP1 to PO being 1.59 eV is
much high, which means that the formation route of PO from OMP1 is disadvantageous. The barrier of OMP2 formation
is 0.30 eV lower than that of allyl (0.90 vs 1.20 eV), but the barrier
of PO formation (1.92 eV) from OMP2 is so much high that
the formation route of PO from OMP2 is hampered. All steps
in the AHS path have relatively lower barrier than the epoxidation
path, and the second H-stripping has a smaller barrier maybe caused
by releasing much energy. Hence, propylene oxidation on the (111)
surface prefers the AHS route-forming acrolein, which agrees well
with the results discussed by Hua et al.14

For propylene selective oxidation on (110) depicted in Figure 3b, the generation
of acrolein from C3H5O species in the AHS path
has a barrier of 1.89 eV, which is unfavorable kinetically in the
experiment. In the epoxidation path, the barriers of OMP1 and OMP2 formation from absorbed C3H6 on the (110) surface are 0.76 and 0.53 eV. To further understand
the physical origin of why OMP1 is less favorable than
OMP2 on (110), electronic analysis of TSs for C3H6 + O → OMP1 and C3H6 + O → OMP2 has been performed based on
the projected COHP method developed by Dronskowski’s team.60,61 In the COHP diagram (Figure 4), the positive and negative values reflect the bonding and
antibonding states. It was found that the population of the bonding
region for the OMP2 system is much larger than the OMP1 system (the integrated COHP up to the Fermi level is −1.19
and −1.26 eV for OMP1 and OMP2, respectively,
reading from the intersection of the Fermi level and the integral
line), which means a strong interaction between the OMP2 and the (110) facet at the TS. Stronger interaction means that OMP2 is more stable on (110) at TS, which leads to a lower barrier.
Thus, the generation of OMP2 is more preferred in comparison
with OMP1 on (110) from geometrical and electronic structure
points. The PO formation from OMP1 requires 0.91 eV with
a barrier of 1.57 eV, and the generation of PO from OMP2 requires 0.94 eV with a barrier of 1.41 eV. The calculated results
show that the process of PO formation can be influenced thermodynamically
and the formation of PO from OMP2 is preferred. Moreover,
the generation of acetone from OMP2 has a barrier of 1.62
eV, which means that acetone formation is relatively disadvantageous
in comparison with PO formation from OMP2. The formation
of propanal has a barrier of 1.39 eV, moderately, competing with PO
formation from OMP2.

and surface Cu of the Cu2O(110) system at TSs: (a) C3H6 + O → OMP1 and (b) C3H6 + O → OMP2.

4.3 Energetic Span Model Analysis
The
turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated with the energetic span model
developed by the groups of Kozuch and Shaik.65,66 This model was used to understand the catalytic performance of Cu2O for propylene selective oxidation at a temperature of 523
K14 and included three assumptions: (i) the TS theory is
valid, (ii) a steady-state regime subsists, and (iii) the relaxation
of the intermediates is fast. In the catalytic cycle of propylene
oxidation, only one transition state and one intermediate determine
the TOF, which called the TOF-determining transition state (TDTS)
and the TOF-determining intermediate (TDI). For identifying the TDI
and TDTS, the energetic span model offers a quantification of the
influence of each intermediate and transition state on the TOF. Once
the TDI and TDTS have been identified, the energetic span (δE), corresponding to the apparent activation energy
of the full cycle, was defined approximately as:  with  The apparent
activation energies of acrolein,
PO, propanal, and acetone formation are calculated to 2.21, 2.53,
3.17, and 2.63 eV on the (111) surface and the corresponding TOFs
of them are 5.48 × 10–9, 4.52 × 10–12, 3.07 × 10–18, and 4.91 ×
10–13 s–1, respectively. The lowest
apparent activation energy and the highest TOF of acrolein mean that
acrolein is the preferred product than others on the (111) surface.
While on the (110) surface, 2.22, 1.59, 1.60, and 1.80 eV are contributed
to the apparent activation energies for acrolein, PO, propanal, and
acetone formation and the corresponding TOFs of acrolein, PO, propanal,
and acetone are 4.39 × 10–9, 5.17 × 10–3, 4.14 × 10–3, and 4.90 ×
10–5 s–1, respectively. The calculated
results indicate that propylene oxidation on the (110) surface favors
the formation of PO. In general, the energetic span model analysis
demonstrated that acrolein is more advantageous on the (111) surface
and PO is more favorable on the (110) surface qualitatively.

4.4 Analysis of the Difference between Cu2O(111) and
Cu2O(110) Surfaces
Based on
above analysis, we can see that a crystal plane-controlled phenomenon
existed in propylene selective oxidation catalyzed by cuprous oxide
and the main products in (111) and (110) surfaces have an essential
distinction; thus, it is very meaningful to analyze the physical reasons
causing such a difference.

In the AHS route, it is obvious that
the H-stripping ability is related to the basicity of oxygen. In Figure 5, the basicity of
the lattice oxygen on (111) and (110) was studied by projected density
of states (PDOS) analysis.67−69Figure 5 indicates that the states of the p orbitals
of the lattice oxygen on (110) (−2.34 eV) are closer to the
Fermi level than that of on the (111) surface (−3.76 eV), meaning
that the basicity of the lattice oxygen on the (110) surface is higher,
which confirms that the first H-stripping step on (110) (0.65 eV)
has a lower barrier than that on the (111) surface (1.20 eV).

Figure 5 PDOS of the
O on (a) Cu2O(111) and (b) Cu2O(110) surface.

In the epoxidation route, for further understanding
the origin
of the barrier variation for PO formation through OMP intermediates
on (111) and (110) surfaces, the calculated geometries of the TSs
were analyzed. The adsorption strength of OMP fragments on the (111)
surface (−0.72 eV for OMP1 and – 0.98 eV
for OMP2) is stronger than that on the (110) surface (−0.67
eV for OMP1 and −0.76 eV for OMP2). The
geometry of TSs leading PO on (111) requires substantial elongation
of Cu–C (122 or 77 pm) bonds in OMP1 or OMP2 (Figure 6a,b),
and the bond lengths of Cu–C (59 or 43 pm) in the OMP1 or OMP2 (Figure 6c,d) are slight elongation for the TS configuration on (110).
Substantial elongation of the configuration between OMPs and TSs requires
larger barrier than slight elongation. As a result, the (111) surface
demands more energy (1.59 and 1.92 eV) to overcome the barrier for
these substantial elongation than the (110) surface (1.57 and 1.41
eV).

with TSs leading to PO on (a, b) Cu2O(111) and (c, d) Cu2O(110) surfaces. Bond lengths are in pm.

4.5 Physical Origin of Energy Barrier
The PO-forming
process can be divided into two key steps, which are
the first and second C–O bond formation. The above results
show a higher selectivity for the second C–O bond forming in
the favored OMP1 path on (111). The formation of PO is
largely determined by the first C–O bond formation, which is
adversely competed against by the AHS reaction. To gain insight into
the main factors affecting the barriers for PO formation on (111),
the energy barrier decomposition scheme developed by Hu and Liu70 was performed for the OMP1 path and
the AHS path (see Figure 7a). The barrier can be decomposed into three terms, EA + BTS = EATS + EBTS + EintTS, where EA + BTS is the activation
energy barrier, EATS(EBTS) is the energy cost for the activation
of reactant A(B) from the IS to the TS without reactant B(A), and EintTS is the interaction energy
between A and B at the TS. Here, A is the O and B is the C3H6. It can be found that the activation of the O is small
and almost the same for both routes and the major part of the barriers
was the C3H6 activation. The interactions between
C3H6 and O were different in both paths. At
the TSs, the interaction was attraction in the AHS path; inversely,
the interaction was repulsion in the OMP1 epoxidation path.
Attractive interaction may be caused by the reason that the H atom
existed between C3H6 and O at the TS in the
AHS path.

Figure 7 (a) Barrier decomposition analysis of the AHS path and the OMP1 epoxidation path on Cu2O(111), (b) the epoxidation
path on Cu2O(111) and Cu2O(110). The black box
represents EA + BTS, the red box represents EOTS, the blue box represents EC3H6TS, and
the green box represents EintTS. Negative (positive)
values of EintTS indicate attraction (repulsion)
between A and B at the TS.

One key factor determining the epoxidation process was also analyzed
by the above mentioned energy decomposition scheme. Here, the preferred
second C–O bond formation step on (111) (i.e., OMP1 → PO) and (110) (i.e., OMP2 → PO) was chosen
to analyze the reason why the epoxidation path is more favorable on
(110) instead of the (111) surface. As seen in Figure 7b, we can know that the major portion of
the activation energy barrier was the O activation on both surfaces
in which the O moves beneath the C3H6 fragment.
However, the activation of the C3H6 can be regarded
as the main reason influenced the barriers because it can account
for the large shift downward of C3H6 on the
(111) surface.

5 Conclusions
The
selective oxidation of propylene on Cu2O(111) and
Cu2O(110) was explored in the present study by DFT calculations
with a Hubbard U correction. The conclusions are summarized as follows:(i) Propylene oxidation catalyzed
by Cu2O
had a strong crystal plane-controlled phenomenon and the main products
were different for (111) and (110) surfaces. On the basis of our calculations,
it was found that the adsorption strength of most reaction species
on the (111) facet is stronger than that on the (110) facet. The projected
crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) method analysis demonstrated
that the orbital interaction between the adsorbate and substrate on
the (111) surface has a more negative value (i.e., stronger interaction).

(ii) The energetic span model analysis results
indicated
that the apparent activation energy of the selective oxidation of
propylene to acrolein is lower than that of PO, propanal, and acetone
on the (111) surface. Thus, the selective oxidation of propylene on
the (111) surface favors at the AHS route and acrolein is the main
product.

(iii) On the (110) surface,
the generation of acrolein
was hampered by the high barrier of the second H-stripping step (1.89
eV). In the epoxidation route, crystal orbital Hamilton population
method analysis indicated that the formation of OMP2 from
propylene is more favorable than that of OMP1. Moreover,
the activation energy barrier of OMP2 → PO was lower
than OMP2 → acetone, which demonstrated that the
OMP2 epoxidation route for the formation of PO was the
most favorable route in propylene selective oxidation.
