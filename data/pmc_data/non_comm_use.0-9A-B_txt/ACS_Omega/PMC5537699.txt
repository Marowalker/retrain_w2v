Digitalis drugs are selective inhibitors of the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase. There are many studies on molecular mechanisms of
digitalis interaction with purified pig kidney enzyme, with the tacit
assumption that it is a good model of human kidney enzyme. However,
previous studies on crude or recombinant human kidney enzymes are
limited, and have not resulted in consistent findings on their digitalis
sensitivities. Hence, we prepared comparably purified enzymes from
human and pig kidneys and determined inhibitory constants of digoxin,
ouabain, ouabagenin, bufalin, and marinobufagenin (MBG) on enzyme
activity under optimal turnover conditions. We found that each compound
had the same potency against the two enzymes, indicating that (i)
the pig enzyme is an appropriate model of the human enzyme, and (ii)
prior discrepant findings on human kidney enzymes were either due
to structural differences between the natural and recombinant enzymes
or because potencies were determined using binding constants of digitalis
for enzymes under nonphysiological conditions. In conjunction with
previous findings, our newly determined inhibitory constants of digitalis
compounds for human kidney enzymes indicate that (i) of the compounds
that have long been advocated to be endogenous hormones, only bufalin
and MBG may act as such at kidney tubules, and (ii) beneficial effects
of digoxin, the only digitalis with extensive clinical use, does not
involve its inhibitory effect on renal tubular Na+/K+-ATPase.

==== Body
Introduction
Na+/K+-ATPase (the
sodium pump) is the energy-transducing
enzyme of the plasma membrane of most eukaryotic cells that catalyzes
the coupled active transport of Na+ and K+,
maintains the resting membrane potential, regulates the cell volume,
and allows Na+-coupled transport of many nutrients and
other ions across the cell membrane.1,2 The enzyme
has two subunits (α and β) that are necessary for ion
pumping and a third subunit (a FXYD protein) that regulates functions
in some cells.1,2 There are multiple isoforms of
each of the subunits, with cell-type and species specificities.1−3

Digitalis compounds, such as digoxin, digitoxin, and ouabain,
are
highly specific inhibitors of all Na+/K+-ATPases;
however, these enzymes from various sources exhibit significantly
different digitalis sensitivities depending on the chemical structure
of the specific digitalis and on the nature of the subunit isoforms
of the enzyme used for assessing digitalis sensitivity.2−4

Na+/K+-ATPase from the mammalian kidneys
has occupied a special place in the history for understanding the
molecular mechanisms of digitalis interaction with the sodium pump.
There are two main reasons for this: (i) since the early classical
work on the purification of the Na+/K+-ATPase,5 it has been realized that the membrane-bound
enzyme purified from the outer medulla of the mammalian kidneys are
homogeneous in isoform composition, consisting of α1, β1, and FXYD2/γ;6 (ii) the convenience of the large-scale preparation of the purified
enzyme from pig kidney has made the crystallization and analysis of
the crystal structure in native and digitalis-bound forms possible.7−11 This and the tacit assumption that the pig kidney Na+/K+-ATPase (PKE) is a good model of the human kidney Na+/K+-ATPase (HKE) has led to a wealth of new information
on the molecular mechanisms of digitalis interaction with the renal
enzyme and on the potential functional consequences of the renal enzyme
inhibition by different digitalis compounds.11 As is the case for all studies on experimental animals, however,
the question arises as to whether the specific conclusions and interpretations
of studies on the pig kidney enzyme also apply to the case of digitalis
interaction with the human kidney enzyme. From this point of view,
it is of considerable concern that the limited number of past studies
that have been done on digitalis sensitivities of the HKE have not
been consistent in results and interpretations.12−15 These studies have had several
shortcomings owing to the legitimate difficulties of working with
human tissues. First, nearly all of the previous work has been done
on recombinant enzymes,12−14 creating a real possibility that
the different membrane environments of the recombinant enzymes may
have influenced their digitalis sensitivities. Second, examination
of this limited literature shows that digitalis sensitivities of the
preparations have been assessed by different means in different laboratories;
for example, comparison of the different potencies of digitalis compounds
as inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase activity have
been done under different assay conditions14,15 and comparison of the binding constants of various digitalis compounds
to those of recombinant enzymes have been done under different conditions.12−14 Therefore, the present study was initiated with two primary aims:
(i) to use purified Na+/K+-ATPase prepared from
healthy human kidneys and to assay inhibitory potencies of five structurally
different digitalis compounds on their activity; (ii) to determine
the inhibitory potencies of the same compounds on the purified pig
kidney enzyme to see if the two enzymes respond differently. Our findings
show identical sensitivities of the two enzymes to each of the tested
compounds, indicating that the pig kidney enzyme is indeed an appropriate
model of the human kidney enzyme. We discuss the causes of previous
disagreements on the digitalis sensitivities of the human enzyme,
and we consider the important implications of our findings for the
suggested hormonal roles of some digitalis compounds and for their
current clinical use in man.

Results
As the primary aim of this
work was to compare the digitalis sensitivities
of human kidney and PKEs and because only a small number of human
kidneys were available, we chose to compare the inhibitory constants
(Ki values) of five structurally different
digitalis compounds on the Na+/K+-ATPase activities
of the enzymes purified from single human and pig kidneys. Using the
procedures described in Materials and Methods, purified preparations from the outer medulla of two pig kidneys
(PKE-1 and PKE-2) and two human kidneys (HKE-1 and HKE-2) were obtained
with the following characteristics: PKE-1, yield 30.7 mg of protein,
specific activity (μmol of released inorganic phosphate (Pi)
mg–1 h–1) 800 ± 40, n = 36; PKE-2, yield 47.6 mg of protein, specific activity
(μmol of released Pi mg–1 h–1) 527 ± 32, n = 33; HKE-1, yield 39.3 mg of
protein, specific activity (μmol of released Pi mg–1 h–1) 572 ± 30, n = 39; HKE-2,
yield 48.8 mg of protein, specific activity (μmol of released
Pi mg–1 h–1) 494 ± 50, n = 12. The indicated specific activity determinations were
made during the 7 month duration of this work.

Comparison of Digitalis
Sensitivities of the Two Enzymes
In previous studies on the
human kidney enzyme,12−15 digitalis sensitivities have been assessed either by determining
the inhibitory potencies on Na+/K+-ATPase activity
under turnover conditions or by determining the digitalis binding
constants of the enzyme that is inhibited by Mg2+ + Pi
or Mg2+ + vanadate. We chose to use the former approach
because the latter leads to generation of inexplicable data (see Discussion).

Using the above preparations
and the procedures described in Materials and Methods, we first addressed two important preliminary issues using the more
readily available PKEs.

Some previous studies on the inhibitory
effects of ouabain and
other digitalis compounds on Na+/K+-ATPase activities
had suggested the necessity of long contact times between the enzyme
and the inhibitor for accurate determination of the Ki values.14−16 Therefore, we examined the possible effects of varying
incubation times (10–60 min) of the enzyme with ouabain on
inhibition of the PKE-1 activity. The results
(Figure 1) clearly
indicated that preincubation for 10 min was sufficient to obtain the
maximal inhibitory effect of ouabain at any concentration in the range
of 0.25–1000 μM.

Figure 1 Effects of varying preincubation times of ouabain
with PKE on the
inhibitory effect of ouabain on enzyme activity. The indicated ouabain
concentrations were preincubated with PKE-1 in the absence of ATP.
The activity was then assayed after the addition of ATP, as described
in Materials and Methods.

Because many digitalis compounds are highly water insoluble,
for
the study of their in vitro effects, it is often necessary to use
solvents such as ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).14,41 We chose to use DMSO in the present study, and hence we determined
if 1% DMSO in the reaction mixtures affected the sensitivities of
PKE to ouabain and digoxin. The results (Figure 2) showed no significant effects of DMSO on
the Ki values of these representative
digitalis drugs.

Figure 2 Effect of 1% DMSO on the sensitivity of PKE to the inhibitory
effects
of ouabain and digoxin on enzyme activity. The Ki values of the two inhibitors were determined for PKE-1 or
PKE-2 activities in the absence and presence of DMSO, as described
in Materials and Methods. At each inhibitor
concentration (n = 6), the activity was calculated
relative to maximal activity. The curves are the fit of data to the
four-parameter variable slope nonlinear model. R2 values (goodness fit): 0.96, digoxin (−DMSO); 0.98,
digoxin (+DMSO); 0.97, ouabain (−DMSO); and 0.94, ouabain (+DMSO). Ki ± SE values: 2.4 ± 0.12 μM,
digoxin (−DMSO); 2.1 ± 0.07 μM (+DMSO); 1.26 ±
0.04 μM, ouabain (−DMSO); and 0.90 ± 0.06 μM,
ouabain (+DMSO).

After ensuring that the
preincubation time of 10 min was sufficient
for ouabain to interact with the enzyme for obtaining maximal inhibition
at any concentration of ouabain, and that DMSO does not interfere
with inhibitor potencies, we determined the Ki values of ouabain, ouabagenin, bufalin, marinobufagenin (MBG),
and digoxin on Na+/K+-ATPase activities of PKE
and HKE in the presence of 1% DMSO. The results (Figures 3 and 4) showed that (a) the Ki value of each
tested inhibitor was nearly the same for PKE and HKE; (b) of the tested
inhibitors, bufalin was the most potent and ouabagenin the least potent;
(c) the genins were significantly less potent than the corresponding
glycosylated inhibitor; and (d) all tested inhibitors produced complete
inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity.

Figure 3 Inhibitory
effects of varying concentrations of ouabain, ouabagenin,
digoxin, bufalin, and MBG on Na+/K+-ATPase activity
of PKE under optimal turnover conditions. Experiments were conducted,
and the Ki values were determined, as
described in Materials and Methods and in
the legend to Figure 2 using PKE-1 or PKE-2 preparations. The calculated Ki values were: bufalin, 0.11 ± 0.005 μM; MBG,
1.5 ± 0.12 μM; ouabain, 0.9 ± 0.05 μM; ouabagenin,
3.07 ± 0.23 μM; and digoxin, 1.95 ± 0.15 μM.

Figure 4 Inhibitory effects of varying concentrations
of ouabain, ouabagenin,
digoxin, bufalin, and MBG on Na+/K+-ATPase activity
of HKE-1 (4A) and HKE-2 (4B) under optimal turnover conditions. Experiments
were conducted, and the Ki values were
determined, as described in Materials and Methods and in the legend to Figure 2, using the indicated HKE preparations. The calculated Ki values for A were: bufalin, 0.075 ± 0.003
μM; MBG, 1.07 ± 0.04 μM; ouabain, 1.22 ± 0.09
μM; ouabagenin, 4.4 ± 0.27 μM; and digoxin, 3.2 ±
0.22 μM. The Ki values for B were:
bufalin, 0.085 ± 0.003 μM and MBG, 1.04 ± 0.06 μM.

The use of purified enzyme preparations
made from single kidneys was imposed in these studies due to scarcity
of human kidneys. This, however, raised the question of whether or
not the above-described results could be due to unknown peculiarities
of the enzymes made from single kidneys. Therefore, we prepared PKE
on a large scale, as described in Materials and Methods with specific activity of 1035 μmol of released Pi mg–1 h–1, and assayed its ouabain sensitivity,
as we did for the single kidney preparations. The results (not shown)
were not significantly different from those presented in Figure 3 for PKEs prepared
from single kidneys.

Discussion
Some of our findings
and conclusions are in conflict with those
of previously published studies; hence, it is necessary that we address
these discrepancies.

The most significant of the disagreements
between earlier findings
and ours are on the sensitivity of HKE to digitalis compounds. This
is best illustrated by comparing the ouabain and digoxin sensitivities
of the human enzyme reported by others and those reported here. Katz
et al.14 reported Ki values of 97 and 250 nM for ouabain and digoxin
(their Table 2), whereas Touza et al.15 reported values of 63 and 280 nM for ouabain and digoxin (their
Table 1), respectively, for Na+/K+-ATPase under
turnover conditions. These values are about 10-fold lower than what
we find for ouabain and digoxin (Figure 4). Why are their values so significantly
different from ours? There are multiple possibilities.

Katz
et al.14 used a recombinant human
enzyme expressed in yeast, reconstituted it with a set of chosen lipids,
and assayed the activity of the resulting detergent-solubilized enzyme
for determining the Ki values. Recently,
there have been elegant studies on crystal structures of P-ATPases
and on the properties of recombinant enzymes, reviewed by Cornelius
et al.,17 identifying both general and
specific lipid interactions with Na+/K+-ATPase
and related enzymes. There have been numerous older studies cited
in Hegyvary et al.,18 suggesting the regulation
of ouabain interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase by
membrane lipids. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that the Ki values obtained by Katz et al.14 may have been distorted by differences between
the lipids they chose for reconstitution and the authentic lipids
of the membrane-bound human kidney enzyme that are yet to be identified.

Another possible explanation for the different Ki values found by us and those of Katz et al.14 is that they chose (their footnote 4) to use
assay times equal to or longer than 40 min for their experiments because
they felt such long reaction times were necessary for accurate Ki determination. We suggest that
the need for long reaction times in such studies is a misconception
introduced to the field by the limited data of a respected laboratory.16 From our findings for ouabain inhibition of
PKE (Figure 1), and
as others have shown for inhibitory effects of several digitalis drugs
on the activity of purified lamb kidney enzymes,19 short preincubation and assay times of 10 min are clearly
sufficient for accurate Ki determinations.
On the whole, we consider the Ki values
reported here for the HKE to be more reliable than those of Katz et
al.,14 obtained with a recombinant human
enzyme.

The second set of Ki values
reported
earlier by Touza et al.15 was not obtained
with a recombinant enzyme but with the use of samples taken from the
unaffected poles of diseased human kidneys, preparation of crude unfractionated
membranes from sample homogenates, and assay of Na+/K+-ATPase activities for 2 h durations, most likely due to low
specific activities of the crude preparations. We suggest that the
unusually long assay duration, potential for enzyme inactivation during
such long reaction times, and the unreported specific activities of
the crude preparations make the reported Ki values of these investigators also less reliable than our values
reported here.

Leaving aside the disagreements on the Ki values, another important issue regarding digitalis
sensitivities of Na+/K+-ATPases requires further
discussion. In a number of studies either on recombinant enzymes12−14 or with purified kidney enzymes,8,11,19 comparison of sensitivities have been made by measuring
binding constants of various digitalis compounds to a phosphorylated
form of the enzyme (E2-Pi) obtained in the presence of Mg2+ and Pi or to the equivalent of E2-Pi that is obtained in the presence
of Mg2+ and vanadate. Although these forms of the enzymes
are known to have the highest affinities for digitalis inhibitors,
it is debatable if they provide useful information about the relative
potencies of the inhibitors. Paula et al.19 correctly pointed out the lack of correlation between binding affinities
for E2-Pi and inhibitory potencies on Na+/K+-ATPase activities. Examination of the work done since their observations
adds to the doubts about the use of such binding affinities for comparison
of digitalis potencies. Consider, for example, that with the use of
relative binding constants and a recombinant human kidney enzyme,
Katz et al.14 noted that MBG was about
200-fold less potent than ouabain (their Table 1), whereas our results
show that in Na+/K+-ATPase activity assays ouabain
and MBG are equally potent (Figure 4A). Also consider that with the use of relative binding
constants and the purified PKE, Laursen et al.11 concluded that ouabagenin was about 800-fold less potent
than ouabain and that ouabagenin was only a partial inhibitor of the
enzyme (their Figure 3), whereas our results show that in Na+/K+-ATPase
activity assays, ouabagenin is about 3-fold less potent than ouabain
and that it produces complete inhibition (Figure 3). Why are there such dramatic and strange
differences between the binding affinities and inhibitory potencies
of digitalis compounds? We suggest that it is due to the forgotten
fact that there is no solid evidence to indicate that the phosphoenzyme
obtained from Pi (E2-Pi) is related to the phosphoenzyme obtained
from ATP or that E2-Pi can be converted to the physiologically relevant
phosphoenzymes.20,21 It may be regrettable that the
uncertainties about E2-Pi and digitalis interaction with it that were
identified years ago22 still remain unresolved,
but the same misgivings also emphasize that for comparison of relative
potencies of digitalis compounds it is prudent not to rely on the
binding data obtained in the presence of Pi or vanadate and rather
rely on Ki values measured under turnover
conditions. Another unfortunate consequence of the use of Pi and Mg2+ for the binding of digitalis compounds to the purified enzyme
is the uncertainty that it has introduced into the elegant structural
studies that have been done on the crystals of various digitalis-bound
PKE preparations.10,11 Because all such crystals were
obtained in the presence of Pi and Mg2+, with the dubious
assumption that the complexes have the same structures as those obtained
from the phosphoenzyme generated from ATP, we suggest the necessity
of reexamination of some of the conclusions derived from these studies.

To summarize the main point of the present study, we conclude that
our findings on Ki values are the best
representations of the potencies of the tested digitalis compounds
as inhibitors of HKE and PKE and that there are no significant differences
between sensitivities of HKE and PKE.

Physiological and Therapeutic
Implications
Perhaps
the most important physiological
implication of this work is related to the more than half a century
of interest of the field in the hypothesis that sodium pump inhibitors
may be naturetic hormones.23,24 This hypothesis has
always been controversial since its proposal and still remains so.25−30

For proponents of the hypothesis, such as some coauthors of
this report,31−33 our findings of the potencies of ouabain, digoxin,
MBG, and bufalin as inhibitors of the HKE (Figure 4) become a guide for deciding if any measured
change in the blood level of the advocated hormones in human beings
may exert a meaningful renal effect. Considering the Ki values of the four putative hormones (Figure 4) and recalling that the highest
reported blood level value of an “ouabain-like compound”
is ≈130 nM,34 it seems that bufalin,
ouabain, and MBG are the only compounds with sufficient potency to
have some renal effect. As it has been aptly pointed out, however,
whether or not any sodium pump inhibitor may exert a hormonal effect
at any locus depends not only on its concentration but also on its
circulating half-life.29 Taking into account
the limited amount of information about the clearance of these compounds
in human beings29 along with their potencies
(Figure 4), we suggest
that only bufalin and MBG remain as potential hormones with renal
effects. Needless to say, however, our findings on the HKE do not
rule out the possibility of hormonal effects of the sodium pump inhibitors
at loci other than those of human kidney tubules.

For those
who seriously doubt the existence of endogenous digitalis
compounds and consider these sodium pump inhibitors simply as drugs,
are there any therapeutic implications of our findings? Of the tested
compounds, only digoxin is an approved drug and still used in the
United States. When used clinically, blood levels are controlled by
appropriate dosage regimens to achieve nearly constant levels in the
low nM range (e.g., 0.64–1.15 nM).35 The Ki value of HKE for digoxin being
≈3000 nM (Figure 4), one would expect little or no renal effects of the clinically
used digoxin. This, however, does not rule out significant and beneficial
therapeutic effects of low nM blood levels of digoxin. As discussed
elsewhere,36 any such effects need to be
due to digoxin interactions with human Na+/K+-ATPase isoforms other than α1 at loci other than
kidneys, most likely in the heart.

Materials and Methods
Kidneys
Pig kidneys were obtained from a local slaughterhouse
and kept frozen at −80 °C until use. Healthy human kidneys
were those that were intended for transplantation but did not match
with any available recipients at the time of donation, hence becoming
available for research instead of being discarded. We received a limited
number of such kidneys through Life Connection of Ohio, following
this organization’s policies and our institutional policies
for research on organs and tissue samples from a human source. These
kidneys had been kept on ice for a few hours before being frozen and
delivered to our laboratory. They were then kept at −80 °C
until use.

Preparation of Purified Na+/K+-ATPase
The enzyme was purified from a single pig
or human kidney by the
widely used procedure of Jorgensen,5 involving
the preparation of microsomes from dissected outer red medulla, sodium
dodecyl sulfate treatment of the microsomal suspension to achieve
selective extraction of proteins other than Na+/K+-ATPase, and fractionation of the remaining crude membranes by sucrose
density gradient centrifugation in an angle rotor5,37 to
obtain pellets of the purified enzyme. These were suspended in 25
mM imidazole-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) and stored at −80 °C
until use. The specific activities of the preparations from the individual
kidneys are indicated in Results. For a limited
number of experiments, the pig kidney enzyme prepared by the large-scale
purification procedure using the combined outer medullas of a large
number of kidneys was also needed. This was made by the same general
procedure,5 as described before.38

Assay of Na+/K+-ATPase
Activity
The steady-state ouabain-sensitive activity was
assayed at 37 °C
by measuring the initial rate of release of Pi from ATP in a reaction
mixture (1 mL), containing 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM ATP, 3 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) in
the presence and absence of 1 mM ouabain. This medium composition
ensures that optimal activity of Na+/K+-ATPase
is achieved.39 To conduct the assay under
standard conditions, the enzyme was preincubated at 37 °C for
10 min in the above medium without ATP and MgCl2. The reaction
was then started by the simultaneous addition of ATP and MgCl2 and stopped after 10 min by the addition of 0.6 ml of 8%
trichloroacetic acid. The enzyme amount (2 μg or less of protein)
was chosen to obtain less than 10% hydrolysis of ATP. To determine
the inhibitory constant (Ki) of a digitalis
compound, the effects of varying concentrations of the inhibitor relative
to those of 1 mM ouabain were determined. Ki values were calculated from curves fit to the data by a nonlinear
regression model using GraphPad Prism software, version 7.

Other
Assays
Pi was measured with Malachite Green,40 using a commercially available kit (Biomol Green;
Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). Protein was determined by the
BioRad DC colorimetric assay.

Digitalis Drugs
Ouabain, ouabagenin, bufalin, and digoxin
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MBG was purified from the parotid
glands of Bufomarinus toads, as previously described.41
