A facile
turn-on chemical sensor array was developed for hydrazine
detection by means of fluorescence pattern recognition. Taking advantage
of the unique properties of the azo group, four different fluorogenic
probes, Seoul-Fluor (SF)-Azo 01–04, were designed and prepared. SF-Azo 01–04 displayed fluorescence enhancement of up to 800-fold upon
reaction with hydrazine, and all probes exhibited excellent selectivity
in the presence of various anions and nucleophiles. By employing the
probes in a cellulose paper-based array system, the hydrazine concentration
was successfully determined by monitoring the change in fluorescent
patterns.

1 Introduction
Hydrazine,
which possesses two single-bonded nucleophilic nitrogen
atoms, exhibits ambivalent chemical behavior. It is known as a fuel
propellant for rockets and spacecraft and has been widely used in
diverse research areas, including pharmaceutical chemistry, agricultural
chemistry, and coordination chemistry.1−4 However, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)5 classifies hydrazine as a
toxic and carcinogenic chemical that damages the liver, kidneys, and
central nervous system.6 Further, high
concentrations of hydrazine vapor have caused catastrophic explosions
at chemical facilities. Therefore, in line with increasing biohazard
risks and environmental safety concerns, attention is directed toward
the development of selective detection methods for hydrazine species.

Various analytical techniques can be applied for the detection
of hydrazine molecules, such as spectrophotometry,7 titrimetry,8,9 voltammetry,10,11 and chromatography.12,13 Among these, fluorescence techniques
have multiple advantages over others, including sensitivity, immediacy,
and easy accessibility.14 Despite several
enthusiastic efforts,15−23 it is very difficult and laborious to develop highly selective and
sensitive fluorogenic probe for certain analytes, such as hydrazine.
On the other hand, optical array with chemoresponsive colorants could
provide more sensitive and selective chemical sensing system via making
use of pattern recognition of the combined response of chemoresponsive
colorants, as our olfactory system.24 We
hypothesized that the development of fluorescent sensor arrays with
more specific chemoresponsive colorant could increase the fidelity
of molecular recognition of the system even further by taking advantage
of their discriminatory powers.25

In the present study, we developed a chemical array system for
hydrazine detection using fluorescent pattern analysis. Instead of
using reported reaction-based electrophilic groups,26−28 we focused
on the azo group—a fluorescence quencher—and its reducing
reaction mediated by hydrazine, due to its general applicability to
a turn-on array system. To generate the components of an array system
for hydrazine detection, we developed four different fluorogenic probes,
SF-Azo 01–04, by introducing an azo
moiety on a versatile fluorescent molecular framework, 9-aryldihydropyrrolo[3,4-b]indolizin-3-one (Seoul-Fluor; hereafter SF).29 We confirmed that the azo functional group successfully
quenches the fluorescence of the SF system and that the reaction of
the SF-Azo probes with hydrazine promotes fluorescence enhancement
of up to 800-fold. Furthermore, simple spotting of SF-Azo compounds
on a cellulose paper allowed us to set up a disposable facile 2 ×
2 fluorescent sensor array. We could successfully detect and discriminate
the concentration of hydrazine samples with the fluorescent array.
This proof-of-concept study not only demonstrated the usefulness of
the underevaluated azo functional group for hydrazine detection but,
more importantly, it validated the practicality of using the fluorescent
array system for sensing molecules of interest.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Design and Synthesis of
Azo-Based Fluorescent
Probes for Hydrazine Detection
Given the strong nucleophilicity
of hydrazine, electrophilic moieties such as acetyl,27,30−33 malononitrile,28,34,35 and vinyl ketone36 have been considered
for preparing the reaction-based fluorescent sensors for hydrazine
detection. However, most reactive groups simply induce a spectral
shift upon hydrazine reaction and do not guarantee on/off-type fluorescence
conversion, which is highly desirable for sensing and assay purposes.37 Therefore, we focused on the azo group due to
its dual functionality as a reactive unit for hydrazine38−40 as well as a universal fluorescence quencher.41,42 A small number of azo-based hydrazine sensors have been reported,43,44 but the main interests lie in specific probe aggregates or the macroscopic
behavior of the reaction products. Therefore, questions remain regarding
azo-based common fluorophores and their on/off behavior as a general
hydrazine sensor. As a fluorescent reporter system, we chose the SF
system, which has proven to be a dynamic molecular platform exhibiting
versatile changes in photophysical properties in response to target
analytes or changes in the surrounding environment.29 In addition, we unveiled the structure–photophysical
property relationship of the Seoul-Flour skeleton, which allows easy
tuning of its emission wavelengths.45 Therefore,
we envisioned the azo-embedded SF system (SF-Azo) as highly efficient
fluorogenic turn-on hydrazine probes (Figure 1a). The emission color tenability of the
SF system might provide a multicolor molecular set for the development
of a fluorescent sensor system generating divergent patterns.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic
of fluorogenic SF-Azo system for the detection of
hydrazine. (b, c) Plausible photodeactivation processes for (b) SF-Azo
compounds and (c) corresponding products after reaction with hydrazine.

A plausible mechanism of the fluorescence on/off
phenomenon for
the SF-Azo system is as follows. Mounting evidence suggests that after
the photoexcitation of an azo-embedded π-conjugation system,
the excitation energy easily dissipates through nonradiative S1 →
S0 internal conversion because the π-bond in an azo group is
involved in CN=NC bond rotation at the S1 state, making the
energy barrier between the S1 state and the S0 state negligible.46,47 Therefore, this excitation energy is efficiently transferred to
the higher-lying S0 vibrational state, resulting in nonradiative energy
decay through vibrational relaxation (Figure 1b). However, after the reaction with hydrazine
molecules, the product loses its π-bond on the azo group, and
consequently, the cis–trans isomerization at the excited state
no longer exists. In this situation, the product loses its excited
energy via the conventional deactivation pathway of the indolizine-based
system (Figure 1c).

In our previous tetrazine-quencher study using the SF platform,
more effective quenching was achieved when the quencher was directly
installed on the indolizine core skeleton.48 Therefore, we designed SF-Azo 01–03 as efficient fluorogenic hydrazine sensors with different fluorescent
emission colors, promoted by three different functional groups: hydro,
dimethylamino, and cyano groups for SF-Azo 01, 02, and 03, respectively (Figure 2). Next, we considered that after the reduction
of an azo group, a newly generated hydrazine moiety in the SF system
should act as an electron-donating group (Figure 1a)49 with a huge
influence on the fluorescence property of the turn-on SF-Azo products.
Since the SF system has previously shown a drastic bathochromic shift
when forged with a pendent aniline moiety,45 we additionally designed SF-Azo 04, bearing a latent
aniline moiety, to cover a longer emission wavelength. Consequently,
we designed a multicolor set of fluorescent SF-Azo 01–04 for a series of fluorogenic hydrazine sensors.

Figure 2 Chemical
structures of SF-Azo 01–04.

For the synthesis of SF-Azo 01–03, the most challenging step was 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
between
the azo-pyridine and the alkyne substrate (Scheme 1). It is worth mentioning that after exhaustive
screening of the reaction conditions for this step, we found that
a copper source was essential for securing the desired azo-indolizine
scaffold, but no desired products were obtained with other metals
or halide sources. After further optimization (see Table S1), copper iodide and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)
solvent were selected for synthesizing the azo-indolizine intermediate, S1, via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Simple iodination, followed
by palladium-mediated cross-coupling reaction allowed the synthesis
of S3–S5 with reasonable isolation yields (Scheme 1 and Supporting Information). For SF-Azo 04, a reported synthetic strategy, i.e., palladium-mediated C–H
bond coupling reaction,50 allowed efficient
synthesis of the desired intermediate, S7. Since we found
that S3–S5, and S7 are
hardly soluble in polar solvents (having high cLog P values, ranging from 9.5 to 10.2; Figure S1), we replaced the triisopropylsilyl group with 3-(piperazin-1-yl)propanoic
acid, which has shown its practicality through a previous application,48 as a water-soluble moiety, to increase the aqueous
solubility (cLog P values from 2.4 to 3.1)
to detect hydrazine in water, and labeled them as SF-Azo 01, 02, 03, and 04, respectively.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of SF-Azo 01–04
2.2 Spectral Changes of SF-Azo 01–04 upon Chemoselective Reaction with Hydrazine
With the four newly designed SF-Azo compounds in hand, we investigated
the changes in the UV–vis spectra for the SF-Azo compounds
in the absence and presence of hydrazine. As shown in Figure 3a–d, all of the compounds
exhibited drastic hypsochromic shifts in the absorption spectra upon
treatment with hydrazine; the maximum absorption wavelengths of SF-Azo 01, 02, 03, and 04 changed
from 506, 522, 492, and 478 nm to 350, 370, 360, and 410 nm, respectively.
This result indicated that the π-conjugation system of SF-Azo 01–04 was reduced after the reaction with hydrazine,
and the electronic states of the CN=NC bond-embedded SF-Azo
compounds were completely different from those of the corresponding
reduced products having a CNH–HNC single bond. To confirm this
plausible mechanism, we incubated the SF-Azo 01 with
hydrazine and monitored the resulting reaction mixture with liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) after 5, 10,
and 20 min incubation. Although we confirmed that mass value of single-bond
reduction product (Figure S3), the mass
value of an indolizine product without an aniline moiety was detected
as well. Therefore, further study is in due course to address the
exact mechanism of the chemical transformation.

Figure 3 Changes in absorption
(a–d) and emission spectra (e–h)
for SF-Azo 01–04 (5 μM) before
(black line) and after (colored line) the addition of hydrazine (200
mM): (a, e) SF-Azo 01, (b, f) SF-Azo 02,
(c, g) SF-Azo 03, and (d, h) SF-Azo 04.
Each probe was excited at the maximum absorption wavelength in a CH3OH/H2O (v/v = 1:1, 5 μM) mixture, and the
inset photos (e–h) show the fluorogenic changes induced by
hydrazine treatment, under a 365 nm handheld UV lamp.

After observing the absorption changes, we evaluated the
turn-off
(before reduction) and turn-on (after reduction) fluorescence properties
for SF-Azo 01–04. Not only SF-Azo 01–03 but also SF-Azo 04 showed
a negligible background signal at the off state, before the reaction
with hydrazine (Figure 3e–h). In contrast, the SF-Azo 01–04 probes displayed strong enhancement of fluorescence intensity
(I/I0 = 287-, 30-, 878-,
and 26-fold, respectively) upon reaction with hydrazine, together
with various emission maxima at 488, 520, 522, and 580 nm, respectively
(Figure 3e–h).
Therefore, these results clearly demonstrate that the SF-Azo system
can serve as a highly efficient fluorogenic hydrazine reporter with
multiple emission colors.

Next, we evaluated the factors affecting
the fluorescence intensity
of the four SF-Azo probes, such as the concentration of hydrazine
and the incubation time with hydrazine. Figure 4a–d shows that all of the four fluorescent
hydrazine sensors displayed dose-dependent fluorescence response according
to the hydrazine concentration, implying that SF-Azo probes could
be used as quantitative reporters in response to hydrazine concentration.
We also checked the changes in fluorescence intensity over hydrazine
incubation time (Figure 4e–h) and found that SF-Azo 01 showed the most
rapid reaction kinetics with hydrazine, followed by 02, 03, and 04.

and (e–h) time-dependent changes
in fluorescence intensity for SF-Azo 01–04 after the addition of hydrazine (200 mM): (a, e) SF-Azo 01, (b, f) SF-Azo 02, (c, g) SF-Azo 03, and (d, h) SF-Azo 04. Each probe was excited at the
maximum absorption wavelength in a CH3OH/H2O
(v/v = 1:1, 5 μM) mixture.

2.3 Chemoselectivity Evaluation for SF-Azo 01–04
To assess the chemoselectivity
of SF-Azo toward hydrazine, we investigated the effect of other chemical
species, such as halides, phosphate, cyanide, nitrate, and other nucleophiles,
on the fluorescence emission of the SF-Azo probes. We incubated 200
mM miscellaneous competing species (Br–, I–, PO43–, Cl–, CN–, NO3–, OH–) or hydrazine monohydrate with fluorogenic SF-Azo probes in a CH3OH/H2O (v/v = 1:1) mixture and monitored the changes
in fluorescence intensity at the maximum emission wavelength of each
probe (Figure 5). In
addition, we incubated the SF-Azo probes with other nucleophiles (200
mM), such as hydrogen peroxide, cyclohexylethylamine, ethylhexylamine,
dimethylamine, ethylenediamine, or urea, in a CH3OH/H2O (v/v = 1:1) mixture. To our pleasant surprise, all of the
SF-Azo probes exhibited excellent chemoselectivity to hydrazine without
any significant perturbation by other chemical species even at high
concentrations (Figure 5). It is worth mentioning that Azo-SF 01 and 03 exhibited better selectivity than 02 and 04. Presumably, this is due to the outstanding turn-on/-off ratio of
Azo-SF 01 and 03 (Figure 3e–h), suggesting the importance of
highly efficient turn-on fluorescence probes with minimized background
noise. Overall, this result demonstrated the usefulness of the azo
functional group as a selective chemical unit for reaction-based hydrazine
sensing.

5 μM) mixture upon the addition of 200 mM anions (Br–, I–, PO4–, Cl–, CN–, NO3–, OH–) and nucleophiles (hydrogen peroxide, cyclohexylethylamine,
ethylhexylamine, dimethylamine, ethylenediamine, urea) compared with
hydrazine. Fluorescence intensity changes against the treatment of
other anions and nucleophiles were normalized against that of hydrazine.
Each probe was excited at the maximum absorption wavelength.

2.4 Application to Paper Array
System for the
Detection of Hydrazine
Finally, we applied our SF-Azo probes
to develop a convenient and easily accessible fluorescence sensor
array for hydrazine detection (Figure 6a). First, simple spotting of 1 mM methanol solution
of SF-Azo probes on cellulose filter paper, followed by drying, allowed
facile preparation of the 2 × 2 fluorescent chemical array. After
the treatment of aqueous hydrazine solution on the designated spots,
the array paper was heated at 75 °C for 30 min and the fluorescence
change was monitored under a 365 nm UV lamp. Fluorescent patterns
in the resulting paper arrays depending on various hydrazine concentrations
(from 1.0 to 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, and 0.001 M) were captured
using a smartphone camera (Figure 6b, array image). To analyze the pattern changes, color
information of the array was extracted using the ImageJ program (Figure 6b, digital image).
As shown in Figure 6c, the combination of four different multicolor fluorogenic SF-Azo
probes in the array exhibited different fluorescence patterns depending
on the concentration of hydrazine. The inflection point of the sigmoid
curves for each turn-on probe was recorded as 9.7, 119.5, 12.1, and
151.1 mM for SF-Azo 01, 02, 03, and 04, respectively (Figure 6c). The limit of detection of the hydrazine
sensor was confirmed to be 2.33 mM (limit of detection = blank signal
+ 3 standard deviation).51,52 This is a much higher
value than 10 ppb, low threshold limit of hydrazine from U.S. EPA.
Further studies are in due course to decrease the detection limit
of the system. To sum up, by taking advantage of the multiemission
property of the SF-Azo system, not only the presence of hydrazine
but also its concentration could be easily monitored by a user-friendly
array system.

experiments.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we focused on the azo functional group for the selective
detection of hydrazine species. By taking advantage of its dual functionality
as a fluorescence quencher and chemoselective reactivity with hydrazine,
we successfully developed a series of reaction-based fluorogenic probes,
SF-Azo 01–04, to monitor hydrazine
in a multicolor format. These probes exhibited a high fluorogenic
turn-on ratio up to 878-fold upon reaction with hydrazine, as well
as excellent chemoselectivity for hydrazine over other anions and
nucleophiles. For convenient application, we generated the disposable
paper array system, which can effectively determine hydrazine concentration
simply by monitoring the pattern changes in the fluorescence emission
color. Compared to conventional other analytical methods, generally
requiring the sophisticated analytical instruments, recognition of
simple fluorescent pattern changes of the array system allowed highly
selective hydrazine chemical sensing system. Therefore, this proof-of-concept
study demonstrate that fluorescent array system could provide easier
and efficient way to develop highly selective chemical sensing system,
such as hydrazine.

For further expansion of azo-fluorophores
with greater hydrazine
sensitivity, it is necessary to consider the reactivity change of
azo groups to hydrazine. It is reported that aryl azo compounds have
different reaction rates with hydrazine, depending on the substituents
of azo compounds.53,54 Therefore, the electronic nature
of aromatic groups connected with an azo bond could be a critical
factor for hydrazine sensitivity. Electron-deficient aromatic groups,
such as pyridine, pyrimidine, or triazine, might be suitable candidates
for general azo-fluorophores with improved hydrazine sensitivity.

4.5 Photophysical Properties Evaluation for SF-Azo 01–04
4.5.1 Photophysical
Property Changes upon Reaction
with Hydrazine
To a solution of SF-Azos (5 μM) in CH3OH/H2O (0.5 mL, v/v = 1:1), hydrazine monohydrate
(200 mM) in CH3OH/H2O (v/v = 1:1) (5 μL)
was added. After 1.5 h incubation at 50 °C, 200 μL of reaction
mixture was added in a 96-well microplate. Absorption was measured
with a clear microplate, and emission was measured with a 96-well
black well/clear bottom plate.

4.5.2 Fluorescence
Responses Depending on Hydrazine
Concentration
To a solution of SF-Azo (5 μM) in CH3OH/H2O (0.5 mL, v/v = 1:1), hydrazine monohydrate
solution (500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 25, and 5 mM) in CH3OH/H2O (0.5 mL, v/v = 1:1) was added. After incubation
at 50 °C (1 h for SF-Azo 01, 2 h for SF-Azo 02 and SF-Azo 03, and 2.5 h for SF-Azo 04), reaction mixture (200 μL) was loaded in a 96-well
black well/clear bottom plate, and photophysical property changes
were measured with a microplate reader. Each compound was excited
at the corresponding absorption maxima. The linearity graphs between
hydrazine concentration and fluorescent intensity were plotted using
GraphPad Prism 5.

4.5.3 Time-Dependent Fluorescence
Change
To a solution of 5 μM SF-Azo in CH3OH/H2O (v/v = 1:1) mixture at 50 °C, hydrazine monohydrate
(2 μL)
was added to prepare 200 mM hydrazine solution. Emission spectra of
SF-Azo compounds were measured using microplate reader every 3 min
until fluorescence signal reached at the maximum intensity. Each SF-Azo
was excited at the corresponding absorption maxima. Data were processed
with GraphPad Prism 5.

4.5.4 Molar Absorptivity Measurements
To measure the molar absorptivity (ε), a solution of SF-Azo
(5, 2.5 and 1 μM) in CH3OH/H2O (v/v =
1:1) was prepared. The solution was placed in a quartz cuvette, and
the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer. To these solutions,
hydrazine monohydrate was added to prepare SF-Azo solution with 200
mM hydrazine. The mixtures were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min,
and the absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer. Absorption
of SF-Azo probes and their corresponding reduced forms were measured
at absorption maximum wavelength (508 nm for SF-Azo 01, 522 nm for SF-Azo 02, 492 nm for SF-Azo 03, 478 nm for SF-Azo 04, 350 nm for reduced-SF-Azo 01, 370 nm for reduced-SF-Azo 02, 360 nm for
reduced-SF-Azo 03, and 410 nm for reduced-SF-Azo 04). Molar absorptivity values were calculated by GraphPad
Prism 5 software, using linear regression.

4.5.5 Selectivity
Assay
To solutions
of SF-Azo (5 μL) in CH3OH/H2O (v/v = 1:1),
various compounds (KBr, KI, KCl, KPO4, KCN, KNO3, KOH, hydrogen peroxide, cyclohexylethylamine, ethylhexylamine,
dimethylamine, ethylenediamine, urea, 200 mM) or hydrazine monohydrate
(200 mM) were added. After 30 min incubation at 50 °C, reaction
mixtures (200 μL) were loaded in 96-well black well/clear bottom
plate and fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader.

4.5.6 Filter Paper Array for Hydrazine Recognition
A corresponding
1 μL stock solution of SF-Azo (1 mM) in CH3OH was
dropped on a 10 cm2 filter paper, and the
paper was dried to prepare a 2 × 2 array (from the upper left
corner, clockwise, SF-Azo 01, 02, 04, and 03). A corresponding 40 μL of hydrazine
aqueous solution (1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, and 0.001 M) was
dropped on the filter paper arrays with a micropipette. After 30 min
incubation of paper array at a 75 °C hot oven, fluorescence was
recorded 130 mm above the array using a camera in Samsung smartphone
S8 plus with constant optical settings (aperture of F1.7, ISO 800,
4.20 mm focal length with 1/10 s exposure time) under a 365 nm handheld
UV lamp. Intensities of the fluorescent spots on the filter paper
array were measured using ImageJ software. The areas of the spots
were selected to be in oval shape, and the intensities were quantified
using the mean gray value measurement. Quantified values were plotted
using GraghPad Prism 5.
