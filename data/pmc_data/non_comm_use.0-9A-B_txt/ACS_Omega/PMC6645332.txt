Chemistry
is among the last of the core natural sciences to embrace
preprints, namely, the publication of non peer-reviewed scientific
articles on the Internet. After a brief insight into the origins and
the purpose of preprints in science, we conducted a concrete analysis
of the concrete situation, aiming at providing an answer to several
questions. Why has the chemistry community been late in embracing
preprints? Is this in relation with the slow acceptance of open-access
publishing by the same community? Will preprints become a common habit
also for chemistry scholars?

1 Introduction
Communities of computer
scientists started to share documents via
computer networks in the 1970s.1 Yet, prepublication
of scientific research as we know it today, namely, the act to share
online a scientific article (a preprint) before the peer-review process,
debuted in the physics community in 1991 when Ginsparg, a physicist
at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States, released software
to share drafts of articles via e-mail transactions referring to a
central repository online.2 Calling them
“preprints”, as noted by Bourne and colleagues recently,3 is an anomaly of language as most of these documents
will never have a print version but only a digital one and most often
a digital object identifier (DOI) alphanumeric string.

With
preprints, scholars retain the author rights prior to publication
and can subsequently publish their work in any journal accepting preprint
manuscripts. Preprints, in general, are stably archived, dated, and
citable, thereby providing evidence for research activity.4

With the advent of World Wide Web, the
repository for physics articles
was first migrated to http://xxx.lanl.gov and then to http://arXiv.org,
a website managed by the Library of Cornell University. As of June
2017, arXiv hosted more than 1.27 million articles in the fields of
physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative
finance, and statistics, with over 120 000 new submissions
expected in 2017.1

In late 2013,
it was biologists’ turn, with the launch of http://bioRxiv.org, a repository for
the life sciences research community hosted, again in the US, by Cold
Springer Harbor Laboratory. From publishing 824 preprints in the first
year,5 the website has grown to current
1000 monthly submissions,6 with over 12 000
preprints already archived. In 2016, the engrXiv, SocArxiv, and psyArXiv
platform were launched to serve, respectively, the engineering, social
sciences, and psychology communities. So significant has become the
impact of preprints that in 2016 two preprints (the 21st and 28th
entries, respectively, from bioRxiv and PeerJ Preprints) were in the
top 100 list of the most-discussed journal content of the year as
reported by Altmetric.7 More importantly,
as emphasized by the founder of arXiv,2 Perelman’s proof of the Poincaré conjecture in three
dimensions, for which the Russian mathematician was awarded the Fields
Medal in 2006, appeared only in three remarkable preprints published
in arXiv in 2003. Similarly, Greider regularly publishes her findings
in bioRxiv along with other Nobel Prize laureates.

As of July
2017, the Open Science Framework free service had indexed
more than 2 million preprints from several disciplines, in fields
ranging from architecture to law to education, from preprint repositories
(within brackets the number of preprints) such as AgriXiv (12), arXiv
(1 209 405), bioRxiv (12 455), BITSS (9), Cogprints
(263), engrXiv (115), LawArXiv (194), LIS Scholarship Archive (5),
MindRxiv (1), PeerJ (2235), http://Preprints.org (1765), PsyArXiv (649), RePEc (804 006), and SocArXiv (1259).
Similarly, the Brazilian online publishing platform SciELO announced
in early 2017 a forthcoming preprint service.8

In chemistry, the preprint server Nature Precedings launched in 2007 was closed in 2012 as the website had become “unsustainable
as it was originally conceived”.9 A similar fate was shared by the chemistry preprint server launched
by Elsevier in 2000 (along with those in mathematics and computer
science) and closed in early 2004 as “the Chemistry, Maths,
and Computer Science research communities did not contribute articles
or online comments to the Preprint service in sufficient numbers to
justify further development”.10 Thirteen
years later, in 2017, Elsevier launched ChemRN,11 a chemistry preprint server managed through a leading social
science and humanities online repository acquired the year before.
A few days later, ChemRxiv, the preprint server announced in 2016
by the American Chemical Society (ACS),12 was released in a fully functioning “beta” release,
a remarkable change compared to 2000 when, with the launch of Elsevier’s
chemistry preprint server, “nearly all ACS journal editors
lined up against it”.13

Hosted
by the ACS and coordinated with inputs from the ACS, the
Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), the German Chemical Society (GDCh),
the broad chemistry community, and other not-for-profit groups and
scientific publishers, ChemRxiv made its debut in August 2017 publishing
a theoretical work on “excitonics”, namely, binary gates
for molecular exciton processing and signaling.14

Why has the chemistry community been late in embracing
preprints?
Is this related to the slow acceptance of open-access (OA) publishing
by the same community? Can we expect widespread acceptance of preprints
also from chemistry scholars? This study aims to give an answer to
these and related questions. After a brief insight into the origins
and the purpose of preprints in science, we conducted an analysis
of the situation, offering an insight into a topic of direct relevance
to today’s and tomorrow’s practitioners of chemical
research.

2 Analysis
An analysis of preprints in
chemistry should start with a consideration
of the economic relevance of the global scientific publishing industry.15 This had global revenues in 2016 exceeding $24.6
billion, with some company’s profits potentially exceeding
a 35% margin.16

From the publishing
viewpoint, chemistry is unique among natural
sciences because 80% of chemistry papers published in 2006 were published
by the five major natural and medical science publishers (ACS, Reed-Elsevier,
Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor & Francis). The fraction
was still above 70% in 2013, whereas it was 40% in 1973 (Figure 1). In the physics
community, for comparison, the proportion of papers published in 2013
by the top five publishers was about 35%.13

So far, attempts by public funding agencies to encourage
researchers
receiving public money to publish their research findings as OA articles
mostly have not been met with universal success. Notably in 2017,
the Gates foundation began to require all funded researchers to publish
papers uniquely in OA format,17 thereby
excluding journals such as Nature, The New
England Journal of Medicine, Science, and
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Many other funders have other OA requirements.

In the early
1990s, the advent of the Internet first, and of the
World Wide Web later, offered an unprecedented opportunity to scholarly
communities, such as immediate posting of their findings prior to
peer review, thus bypassing the time to reveal new findings through
peer review, where a manuscript may be delayed by successive rejections
and resubmissions.18 Preprints have the
intrinsic ability to solve the main problem of the peer-review process,
such as a delay in publication. Such delays can be a significant challenge.
Some authors are concerned about a refereeing bias, against authors
from emerging bylines, or when authors propose ideas different from
the mainstream.19 It is perhaps not surprising
that the need for a national preprint repository was first identified
for a huge and rapidly developing country such as India, urging young
minds to preprint their work on the new national online archive to
ensure priority.20

By reducing time
for publication, preprints enable researchers
to establish priority and, at the same time, share results and data
with their colleagues. In similar cases, such as Preprints, ChemRxiv,
and bioRxiv, the preprint is immediately assigned a DOI which allows
citation and citation tracking. Reducing the time for publication
can be of vital importance in case of health emergencies, for instance,
when research on the Zika virus was publicly made available in real
time on the Zika Open-Research Portal (https://zika.labkey.com) to help
facilitate collaborative research and move science ahead rapidly toward
cures and prevention.10

Scholars
who post preprints position their research so that colleagues
and other scientists around the world can immediately give feedback,
helping to progress the work faster. The comments received by other
scholars can be used to revise and improve the quality of the work,
which often then ends up published in conventional scientific journals,
as it happens to a significant fraction of manuscripts posted on arXiv,
bioRxiv, and the other repositories mentioned above. Hence, in principle,
the fundamental advantage of preprints is the acceleration of scientific
and technical progress.

Another key advantage for authors is
that they are able to claim
priority on new ideas in preprints. Such postings should help authors
avoid having unethical referees take ideas and claim them for their
own, an issue lamented by several authors and a known misconduct for
which the Committee on Publication Ethics (a body established in 1997
by a group of journal editors now having over 10 000 members
worldwide from all academic fields) has published guidelines already
in 2010.21 However intolerable, this practice
continues to occur even when submitting to high-impact-factor journals
in all sort of disciplines including medicine,22 and not only to scientists in their early career, as Noble
Prize Lipscomb remarked several years ago:

“I no longer
put my most original ideas in my research proposals,
which are read by many referees and officials. I hold back anything
that another investigator might hop on and carry out. When I was starting
out, people respected each other’s research more than they
do today, and there was less stealing of ideas.”23

Wiersma, a professor of forest resources
in the US and the editor
of Environmental Monitoring & Assessment, argues
that the problem with peer review is that it is an “honor system”
in which “if people want to break the honor system, there is
nothing you can do”.24

Today,
the problem of stealing ideas by unethical referees can
be entirely circumvented by the adoption of preprints. Further, key
funding agencies supporting research in life sciences, chemistry,
and medicine including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in
the US,25 the UK Medical Research Council,26 and the Wellcome Trust27 almost concomitantly announced in early 2017 new policies for which
the citation of preprints in grant applications is accepted and, in
some cases, encouraged.

Research chemists have been notoriously
reluctant to accept OA,
and the number of OA publications in chemistry is still significantly
lower than those in many other disciplines.28 Puzzled by such low response of the chemistry community, scientific
information scholars have advanced all sort of tentative explanations:
from chemistry being a “long tail” science in which
small research units would adopt a predominantly noncollaborative
mode of research,29 through the influence
of the chemical industry and proprietary information.

In a presentation
given at the 2011 Spring Meeting of the ACS,
the editors of the first scientific OA publisher in chemistry (Chemistry
Central, founded in 2006, whose parent company BioMed Central was
acquired two years later by Springer), noting that the acceptance
of OA in chemistry was 5 years behind life sciences, suggested one
of the main reasons:30 the influence of
chemical societies, three of which (ACS, RSC, and GDCh) are among
the leading publishers in chemistry today publishing several OA journals.31

In detail, the team showed the outcomes
of the European Union-funded
Study of Open Access Publishing involving 42 000 respondents
and 2300 chemists across the world in which the lowest percentage
of researchers who said that OA journals would be beneficial were
chemists.32 In the ranking by country,
research chemists based in the UK (31st out of 33 countries), in the
US (24th), and in Germany (19th) were in the lower part of the ranking.

Interested in their career and in securing funds for their research,
chemists continue to publish in journals of renowned reputation so
as to increase the impact of their research in terms of citations
and thus their h-index and other scientometric indicators to which
their promotion and tenure track are closely bound,33 although studies showing that OA articles, for example,
in computer science receive significantly more citations than subscription-based
articles that appeared in prestigious journals as early as of 2001.34 Furthermore, academic review committees often
use publication count and the “quality” of journals
published in to evaluate people much more than citation count. Put
bluntly, “a paper in a poorly known journal which is cited
200 times is worth much less than a Nature paper
which is cited three times”.35 Yet,
as the third decade of the 21st-century approaches, the use of preprints
might become the norm also in chemistry, as we critically aim to argue
in the following.

3 Discussion
In the
last two decades, two significant changes have occurred
in communicating chemical research. One is the now complete digitalization
of the scientific information flow,36 with
several chemistry journals no longer printing journal issues but producing
only articles in digital format (normally in both portable document
format and hypertext markup language). Another is the now predominant
use of the World Wide Web to search for scientific information,37 especially through free search services such
as those offered by Google Scholar. The latter search engine, furthermore,
effectively tracks citations of researchers who use it also for locating
updated scientometric information of relevance to their own research
interests.38

From Chemical
Communications to Organic
Letters, numerous prestigious journals are available to chemists
to quickly publish findings of high relevance, and even in OA format
when paying the article publishing charge. The same is true for biology
and physics where numerous journals, including new “express”,
“protocols”, and “letters” versions of
prestigious titles, offer a fast track to peer-reviewed publication,
but this has not slowed down the acceptance of preprints in those
communities. In our view, scholars in the chemical sciences will likely
soon start to use preprints to claim priority for their findings,
sharing, and collecting feedback in matter of days or weeks, rather
than in months or years as it used to be with conventional publishing.
For those who stick to the old model, the risk is to see colleagues
posting preprints of their work in the same subfield of contemporary
chemical research to rapidly progress the field while they are still
waiting months for the reviewers’ reports.

This is also
the case of what happened in the biology community,
which came to preprints about two decades after physics. An information
specialist arguing in early 2016 that they were curious “to
see if bioRxiv continues to see its submissions grow”,10 one year later saw the number of preprints in
bioRxiv surpassing the 12 000 threshold (from less than 900
in the first year).

This may explain why large publishers have
recently started new
preprint repository services, such as preprints owned by MDPI, and
it may also explain why arXiv39 and bioRxiv40 were frequently used also by chemists, often
for preprints jointly authored with physicists or life scientists.
Gone are the days when chemistry preprint servers were being closed
owing to insufficient submissions.

Joining the open science
practice, chemists and especially young
chemical research practitioners will discover or rediscover that,
as stated by Nosek, a social psychologist and open science advocate,
“sharing is good”, that is, sharing research with peers
is good for discovery,41 thus restoring
the original meaning of scientific publication vividly illustrated
by Evariste Galois, the eminent mathematician creator of the Group
theory (later widely used by theoretical chemists), in 1831:

“Je rêve d’un temps où l’égoïsme
ne régnera plus dans les sciences, où on s’associera
pour étudier, au lieu d’envoyer aux académies
des plis cachetés, on s’empressera de publier ses moindres
observations pour peu qu’elles soient nouvelles, et on ajoutera:
“Je ne sais pas le reste” (I dream of a time when selfishness
will no longer reign in the sciences, when people will associate to
study, instead of sending sealed folds to the academies, hastening
to publish their least observations no matter of carrying just a bit
of innovation, adding: “I do not know the rest”)”.42

Whether or not preprints and OA will rid
science of egoism, as
auspicated by Galois, interest for claiming priority, gaining visibility,
and eventually securing research funds perhaps will become more powerful
drivers for this movement.

Following the recent decision of
the world’s largest science
funding agency (NIH, funding research with >$26 billion in 2013),43 we can reasonably anticipate that other scientific
funding agencies worldwide will approve citation of preprints in grant
applications, including those supporting research in chemistry. Following
such acceptance by funders, promotion, search, and tenure committees
will do the same, accepting the citation of preprints in the curriculum
of applicants. We expect, as with NIH,44 this will occur, along with adopted clear policies on how preprints
should be evaluated and what types of preprint servers should be used.
In another recent example of emerging guidelines for preprint servers,
the director of the GDCh noted “nonrefereed publications, for
example on preprint servers, should be clearly classified as such”.45

4 Conclusions
This
work aims to answer the question whether the time has come
for preprints in chemistry, as compared to the analysis by geneticist
Bhalla for biology preprints in early 2016.46 The study mainly compares the special case of chemistry with biology,
as a natural science discipline that has recently embraced preprints.

Although being among the last core natural sciences to embrace
preprints, chemistry is poised for success in this evolution. Interested
in their career and securing research funds, chemistry researchers
cannot ignore preprints any longer. Preprints are accepted and even
encouraged by public funding agencies, starting from the world’s
largest (the NIH), and are soon expected by many others across the
world. Many preprints are fully indexed; preprints are widely read
(as of mid-September 2017, the first six preprints in BioRxiv had
408 384 downloads, with the sixth alone counting 26 367
downloads),47 and cited (e.g., preprints
in the arXiv condensed matter section were found in 2006 to be cited
nearly twice more than nonpreprinted publications),48 providing researchers with the visibility in the research
community while enabling authors to easily access online the article
metrics and be contacted by interested collaborators or fellow scientists.49

From the fundamental viewpoint of research
practice, the benefits
of immediate feedback on the preprint from a much wider audience (online
preprints can be freely accessed and downloaded) are so significant
that scholars competing for priority in discovery and innovation will
increasingly post their findings as preprints as a normal part of
the research communication process. Preprints, indeed, have the intrinsic
ability to add value to the peer-review process.50

One might also ask what role will scientific journals
play when
every paper is posted as a preprint, namely, what value would journals
add in such a scenario. Typically, part of the value assigned to journals
is their editing and peer-review processes.51 Both services can now be obtained for prepublication work. For peer
review, for example, F1000Research transforms a preprint in a published
article after it is openly peer-reviewed and accepted; for editing,
authors can hire a scientific editor for a particular article without
involving a journal. Therefore, basically, if this scenario will materialize,
today’s journals will reshape into online publication platforms
publishing first the preprint (following a first editorial scrutiny)
and then, following renewed peer review, publishing the OA final version
of the article linked with the preprint.

Eventually, preprints
will help to provide a mechanism to move
the field toward a new publishing model where each work stands on
its own merits regardless of what journal it is published in. This
is what happened in physics arXiv and in biology with bioRxiv, where
even the sole prepublication of the proof of the Poincaré conjecture
in three dimensions granted Perelman in 2006 the equivalent of Nobel
Prize in mathematics. Also in chemistry, journal editors will start
browsing preprint servers looking for suitable articles likewise to
what the editors of PLOS Genetics(52) and Genome Biology(53) currently do, soliciting authors to submit their preprints
for peer review and, increasingly, for open peer review.

To
compete with numerous prestigious journals such as PLoS
One accepting preprints, chemistry journals which currently
do not accept preprints will shortly be pressurized to change their
policies toward prepublication, as it already happened at the majority
of chemistry journals. ACS journals, for example, have set prior publication
policies, including whether to accept or reject preprints. As a sign
of the growing acceptance of preprints in the chemistry community,
the majority of the latter journals now allow preprints.

At
the 2017 Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates, Chalfie lately informed
the audience that periodically a member of his research group is required
to select a preprint on a topic related to his/her research.54 The study is discussed in a subsequent group
meeting, and comments are eventually sent to the corresponding author
of the preprint to raise new ideas both in Chalfie’s group
and in that of the author.

Why should research groups in chemistry
not adopt similar practices?
Chemists also are clearly interested in adopting a more collaborative
mode of research which makes use “of new technologies to facilitate
data sharing and research collaboration”.29

In China, where chemistry in 2014 accounted for 61%
of the country’s
total weighted fractional count,55 collaborations
in the field of chemistry soared to unprecedented levels, with major
collaborations in 2015 with groups based in the US, Germany, Japan,
Singapore, UK, Australia, Canada, and France.56

Preprint servers will of course need to be supported financially;
hence, they will be owned or coordinated by nonprofit scientific societies
(such as ChemRxiv with ACS, RSC, and GDCh), existing commercial publishers
(such as Preprints or ChemRN), public or private universities (such
as arXiv which is principally hosted by the Cornell University Library
with financial support from many different organizations including
the Simons Foundation), private laboratories (such as bioRxiv principally
hosted by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a private, nonprofit
institution), or public or private research funders. Preprint servers
will continue to thrive and improve, becoming of central relevance
and providing a new way to communicate innovation in science, including
chemistry. The process of innovation in communication is already underway,
and this study will hopefully assist research chemists in the transition
to open science for the benefit of the main users of chemical innovation:
mankind.

The authors
declare no competing financial interest.
