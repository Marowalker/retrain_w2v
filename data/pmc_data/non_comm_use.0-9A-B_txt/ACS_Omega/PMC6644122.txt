We here report the
self-organization process of poly(styrene-b-ethylene/butadiene-b-styrene) (SEBS)
triblock copolymer chains physically adsorbed on a non-neutral surface.
Spin-cast SEBS thin films were prepared on silicon (Si) substrates
and then annealed at a high temperature far above the bulk glass transition
temperatures of the two constituent blocks. To reveal the buried interfacial
structure, we utilized solvent rinsing processes and a suite of surface-sensitive
techniques including ellipsometry, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force
microscopy, and grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering. We
revealed that the SEBS chains form two different chain structures
on the substrate simultaneously: (i) “flattened chains”
with the average height of 2.5 nm but without forming microdomain
structures; (ii) “loosely adsorbed chains” with the
average height of 11.0 nm and the formation of perpendicularly oriented
cylindrical microdomains to the substrate surface. In addition, the
kinetics to form the perpendicular-oriented cylinder was sluggish
(∼200 h) and proceeded via multistep processes toward the equilibrium
state. We also found that the lateral microdomain structures were
distorted, and the characteristic lengths of the microdomains were
slightly different from the bulk even after reaching “quasiequilibrium”
state within the observed time window. Furthermore, we highlight the
vital role of the adsorbed chains in the self-assembling process of
the entire SEBS thin film: a long-range perturbation associated with
the adsorbed chains propagates into the film interior, overwhelming
the free surface effect associated with surface segregation of the
lower surface tension of polystyrene blocks.

1 Introduction
Thin
films of block copolymers (BCPs) self-assembled into highly
ordered periodic microdomain structures with the order of 10–100
nm offer great opportunities in many nanofabrication applications.1,2 Especially, cylindrical microdomains with a perpendicular alignment
to a substrate surface have been paid great attention for fabricating
masks for nanolithography,3 templates4 and nanostructured membranes,5 photovoltaic cells,6 low-k dielectrics,7 and high-density
data storage media.8 When BCPs are confined
in a thin-film geometry, the orientation of microdomains strongly
depends on molecular interactions at the interfaces (i.e., a polymer–air
interface and a polymer–substrate interface) and the commensurability
between film thickness and interdomain spacing of the BCP.1 Preferential surfaces are wet by the preferred
block with the lower surface energy,9−11 resulting in parallel
orientations of the microdomain structures near the interfaces.12−15

Polymer wetting at the solid–polymer melt (SPM) interface
has attracted significant attention because of its crucial roles in
determining the structures and physical/mechanical properties of thin
polymer films. Different research groups evidenced the formation of
several nanometer-thick adsorbed polymer layers at the SPM interfaces
regardless of the magnitude of attractive solid–segment interactions.16−20 It should be emphasized that irreversible adsorption used in this
paper refers to physical adsorption or physisorption, where polymer
chains are adsorbed on solid surfaces through dispersion, dipolar
forces, or van der Waals interactions. Using a solvent rinsing procedure
proposed by Guiselin21 in conjunction with
various experimental techniques, we previously demonstrated that adsorbed
layers formed at the SPM interfaces of homopolymer thin films are
composed of an inner higher density region with the thickness of a
few nanometers regardless of molecular weights (Mw) and an outer bulk-like density region whose thickness
increases with increasing Mw.19,22−26 Although the mobility of the strongly adsorbed polymer chains (hereafter
assigned as “flattened chains”) in the inner region
is significantly hindered,19,22,26 the polymer chains in the outer region (hereafter defined as “loosely
adsorbed chains”) are still mobile,27 flexible,28 crystallizable,28−30 can interact with unadsorbed neighboring chains,26,31 or swell in good solvents.24,31,32 In addition, there are many experimental results to support that
the effects of the loosely adsorbed chains propagate into the film
interior, resulting in long-range perturbations on the structural,
dynamical, and physical properties of polymer thin films including
glass transition temperature (Tg),17,18,27,33,34 local viscosity,35 chain diffusion/interdiffusion,28,31,36 crystalline structures,29,30,37,38 and thermal
stability/wettability.26,39 Napolitano et al. also reported
that both the nonequilibrium features of polymer thin films and the
slow equilibration process of polymer chains in the vicinity of a
solid surface are correlated with irreversible polymer adsorption.40,41

Recently, we uncovered the unique structure of BCP flattened
chains
on a bare (non-neutral) silicon (Si) substrate. It was found that
not only preferred blocks but also nonpreferred blocks adsorbed on
the substrate surface side-by-side,42 forming
a two-dimensional (2D) network structure with the characteristic length
of about 10 nm. In spite of interfacial energetics, microdomains (at
least cylinder and lamellar), or chain architectures, the network
structure was formed and thermodynamically arrested because of the
large number of pinning sites and was therefore considered to be long-lived
at the SPM interface even when exposed to a solvent vapor.42 Important questions now arise: What is the structure
of the loosely adsorbed BCP chains (if any)?; What is the formation
process of the loosely adsorbed chains during a thermal annealing
process?; How do unadsorbed BCP chains next to the loosely adsorbed
chains self-assemble into microdomain structures ?; and Does the substrate
effect associated with the loosely adsorbed chains exist? If so, how
far does the effect propagate into the film interior? At this point,
there are no experimental and theoretical studies to address these
fundamental but crucial questions in the field. In this paper, by
using the aforementioned solvent rinsing approach in conjunction with
a suite of surface-sensitive techniques, including ellipsometry, X-ray
reflectivity (XR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and grazing incidence
small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS), we aim to shed light on the
self-assembling process of poly(styrene-b-ethylene/butadiene-b-styrene) (SEBS) thin films in the vicinity of a non-neutral
Si substrate surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate the long-range perturbation
of the loosely adsorbed chains on the self-assembling process of the
SEBS thin film.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 SEBS Thin Films Prepared on Si Substrates
Figure 1 shows the
surface morphologies of the 28 nm (ht = L0, L0: the domain
spacing) and 84 nm (ht = 3L0) thick SEBS films on the Si substrates after thermal
annealing at 150 °C for three different annealing times (tan): 3, 96, and 186 h. Cylinders perpendicular-oriented
(C⊥) to the film surface were formed in the 28 nm
film at tan = 3 h. We confirmed that this
ordering was not present in the as-cast film and therefore induced
by thermal annealing (Figure S1). Based
on the cross-sectional analysis, the average diameter (dcy) of the cylindrical domains and the domain spacing
were estimated to be dcy = 13 ± 2
nm and L0 = 28 ± 2 nm, respectively.
Further GISAXS analysis on the thin films will be discussed later.
On the other hand, as the film thickness increased to ht = 3L0 (84 nm thick), parallel-oriented
(C∥) cylinders occupied the entire film at tan = 3 h, and the surface morphologies did not
show any significant changes with increasing tan. This is attributed to surface segregation of the lower
surface energy of the PS blocks, resulting in the C∥ cylinders at the topmost surface. As tan increased, the C∥ cylinders began to appear at
the topmost surface of the 28 nm thick film at the late stage of the
thermal annealing process (Figure 1b,c). Nevertheless, the observation suggests that the
formation of the C∥ cylinders is hindered at the
surface of the 28 nm thick film compared with that of the thicker
film. This may be related to a geometric restriction against the formation
of C∥ cylinders to the film surface within such
a confined geometry.43 In our investigation,
as will be discussed later, we find that the irreversible adsorption
of the SEBS chains on the Si substrate plays another crucial role
in determining the orientation and ordering kinetics of the cylindrical
microdomains within the thin film.

and 84 nm thick (d–f)
SEBS films prepared on the Si substrate and annealed at 150 °C
for 3, 96, and 186 h (from left to right). The scan sizes and the
scales of the phase images are 1 × 1 μm and ±2°,
respectively. The corresponding 2D fast Fourier transformation of
the phase image is shown in the inset of Figure 1a.

Figure 2a,b
show
the 2D GISAXS patterns for the 84 nm thick films on the Si substrates
after annealing at 150 °C for tan = 3 h (Figure 2a)
and tan = 96 h (Figure 2b). We observed that a ringlike scattering
pattern at the first-order peak position (located at qxy* = 0.22 nm–1) became more intense as the
annealing time increased. As C∥ cylinders are a
majority at the topmost surface based on the AFM image (Figure 1), this suggests the formation
of more C∥ cylinders underneath the topmost surface.

Figure 2 Representative
2D GISAXS patterns for the 84 nm thick SEBS films
prepared on the Si substrate and annealed at 150 °C for 3 (a)
and 96 h (b). Figure 2c shows the annealing time dependence of the 1D GISAXS profiles for
the 84 nm thick SEBS films along the qxy direction (the in-plane direction).

At the same time, two streaks aligned along the qz direction at qxy* = 0.22 nm–1 were observed in the 2D GISAXS
patterns.
These arise from the following two possibilities: the presence of
C⊥ cylinders (but slightly tilted)44 or in-plane arrays of C∥ cylinders. The
key to distinguish between the two scenarios is an appearance of a  peak that
is originated from hexagonally
packed cylinders in the lateral direction. Although it was difficult
to identify the peak in the GISAXS data (Figure 2c), an oxygen plasma etching method in conjunction
with the AFM experiments reveals the formation of C⊥ cylinders at the surface region about 10 nm below the topmost surface
of the 84 nm thick film. We will discuss this later.

Figure 2c shows
the annealing time dependence of the one-dimensional (1D) GISAXS profiles
for the 84 nm thick SEBS films. There is a gradual increase in the
sharpness of the peaks with increasing time, indicating that the lateral
ordering of cylindrical microdomains was improved during the annealing
process. However, the ordering kinetics was extremely slow even at
150 °C (which is far above the Tg values of the two constituting blocks). Although it seems that the
surface morphologies of the films remain unchanged regardless of tan(Figure 1d–f), GISAXS experiments with an incident angle
of 0.06° (below the critical angle of SEBS), which allowed us
to probe the topmost surface region (about 9 nm in thickness), showed
that the microdomain structures at the surface were also improved
gradually with time (Figure S2). Hence,
we anticipate that the slow rearrangement of the cylindrical microdomains
take place within the entire film.

2.2 Physisorption
of SEBS Chains on the Si Substrate
Figure 3a shows
representative XR profiles for the SEBS residual layers after toluene-rinsing
and chloroform-rinsing with tan = 185
h. As shown in Figure 3b (and Figure 5 later),
we confirmed that all residual layers (after the thermal pre-annealing
and subsequent solvent rinsing processes) covered the Si substrates
entirely. The best-fits (shown by the solid lines in Figure 3a) to the XR data were obtained
by using a three-layer dispersion model composed of a Si substrate,
a SiOx layer, and a SEBS layer. As seen
from the figure, the different solvent leaching processes allowed
us to extract two different kinds of adsorbed layers with different
thicknesses (i.e., the interfacial sublayer with toluene-rinsing and
the flattened layer with chloroform-rinsing; see Experimental Section for the details). However, unlike our
previous findings in homopolymer interfacial sublayers,19,22,26 we were not able to identify
that the SEBS interfacial sublayer is composed of two layers of different
densities. This is possibly due to the lack of well-resolved Kiessig
fringes at qz > 3
nm–1. Instead, the best-fit for the SEBS interfacial
sublayer
was obtained with a single-layer model having the δ value of
the bulk SEBS (δbulk = 1.96 × 10–6).

Figure 3 (a) XR curves of the SEBS quasiequilibrium interfacial sublayer
(red circles) and flattened layer (blue circles) on the Si substrate.
The solid lines correspond to the best fits to the data based on the
dispersion (δ) profiles against the distance (z) from the SiOx surface as shown in the
inset. Red line: The interfacial sublayer; blue line: the flattened
layer. The δ value of bulk SEBS at an X-ray energy of 10.5 keV
is calculated to be δbulk = 1.96 × 10–6. (b) AFM height image of the SEBS flattened layer. The scan size
is 2 × 2 μm. The height scale is 0–5 nm.

As previously reported for PS-based cylinder-forming
and lamellar-forming
diblock and triblock copolymers,42 we observed
similar percolating-like structure in the SEBS flattened layer (Figure 3b). The XR profile
(indicated in blue in Figure 3a) for the SEBS flattened layer could not be well fit with
a simple slab model, especially at qz > 3 nm–1. We postulate that
this
is due to the presence of the percolating network structure, which
may give rise to additional diffuse scattering and makes the density
and roughness determinations of the flattened layer ambiguous, whereas
the thickness can be independently and accurately determined from
the “period” of the oscillation fringes.19 Hence, it is not conclusive that the SEBS flattened
layer has a higher density than the bulk, as evidenced for the homopolymer
flattened layers.19,20

Figure 4 summarizes
the thicknesses (h) of the SEBS flattened layers
and interfacial sublayers as a function of tan measured by ellipsometry/XR. The growth of the flattened
layer (indicated by blue circles) exhibits a linear increase, h(tan) = h0 + vtan (where h0 and v are the initial adsorbed layer
thickness resulting from the spin-coating process alone and the growth
rate, respectively) with v = 0.07 nm/h at the early
stage of adsorption (tan ≤ 28 h).
After reaching the crossover time (tc)
of tc = 28 h, the flattened layer reached
the “quasiequilibrium” state (no more growth with time)22,25 with the thickness of h = 2.5 ± 0.4 nm. It
is interesting to note that this tc value
is much longer than those of the PS or PB flattened layers with similar
molecular weights (tc = 2–3 h22,24,26).

sublayer (red circles) and flattened
layer (blue circles) on the Si substrate against tan at T = 150 °C. The dashed lines
correspond to the best fits of the power-law growth at the early stage.
The solid lines correspond to the best fits of the two-step logarithmic
growths during the late stage. The crossover time, tc, and the intermediate time, ti, described in the text are indicated by arrows.

Following the early theoretical studies on adsorption kinetics
where the conformation of an adsorbed chain is governed by “piecemeal
deposition”,45,46 Napolitano et al.47,48 recently proposed that the adsorption kinetics for homopolymer chains
from the melts can be divided into the two regimes separated by tc: a linear growth at the early stage (i.e.,
diffusion-controlled adsorption) and a logarithmic growth at the late
stage (i.e., a “reeling-in” process of the loosely adsorbed
chains, which is more sluggish due to excluded-volume repulsion of
the already existing adsorbed chains and chain entanglements with
unadsorbed chains). In contrast to their results, the growth curve
of the SEBS interfacial sublayer (indicated by red circles) can be
divided into four different regimes: the early linear regime followed
by two logarithmic growths with two different growth rates at tan > tc and the
plateau regime. According to a previous report by Eskilsson and Tiberg,49 the adsorption kinetics of poly(ethylene oxide-b-tetrahydrofuran-b-ethylene oxide) triblock
copolymers from solution on silica substrates exhibited an intermediate
logarithmic growth because of displacements between the different
adsorbed blocks at the interface in a selective solution.49

To gain a comprehensive insight into the
formation kinetics of
the SEBS interfacial sublayer, morphological changes were characterized
by AFM. Figure 5 shows the time evolution of surface morphologies
of the SEBS interfacial sublayers. During the initial linear growth
regime (i.e., tan < tc), the interfacial sublayers showed irregular patch structures
but with a relatively low surface roughness (root mean square roughness
= 1.7 nm) (Figure 5a). It should be emphasized that C⊥ cylinders existed
partially at the surface at tan = 12 h
(Figure 5d). At tc < tan < ti, micelle-like polymer aggregates (several
hundred nanometers in average size and about 12 nm in average height)
emerged and coexisted with smaller island structures with the average
size of about 20 nm (Figure 5b). Here, we define ti as the
intermediate time. Although the mechanism of the intermediate process
is not conclusive yet, we postulate that the total number of segment-solid
contacts (i.e., “effective grafting density (ρT) for adsorbed chains composed of “tails”, “loops”,
and “trains” calculated by ρT = (ntail + 2nloop)/A, where A is the area of a substrate and ntail and nloop are
the numbers of tails and loops of adsorbed chains, respectively) is
not so high during the stage. Then, the toluene rinsing and subsequent
drying process for the ex situ AFM experiments, which changes the
solvent quality from good to poor for SEBS, may induce phase-separated
structures (i.e., polymer-rich and polymer-poor regions), as reported
for an end-grafted polymer brush.50 Further
experiments are currently in progress to understand the detailed mechanism.

Figure 5 (a–d)
AFM height images of the SEBS interfacial sublayers
at different growth stages during the irreversible adsorption process
on the Si substrates. The scan sizes of the images are 5 × 5
μm or 10 × 10 μm. The height scales of all images
are 0–10 nm. The corresponding zoomed-in phase images of (a,c)
are shown in (d,e), respectively. The scales of the phase images are
±2°.

After reaching ti, the reeling-in process
of the loosely adsorbed chains proceeds with time45,46 and the large polymer aggregates disappeared, and the interfacial
sublayer became relatively smooth with increased effective grafting
density (Figure 5c).
The expanded AFM phase image (Figure 5e) further elucidated the formation of cylindrical
microdomains with a perpendicular orientation within the interfacial
sublayer. At ti < tan < tq (we hereafter define tq as the quasiequilibrium time), although the
interfacial sublayer still grows with a much slower growth rate, the
surface morphologies and the ordering of cylindrical microdomains
in the interfacial sublayers (with the thickness of about 10 nm) remained
almost unchanged. When tan > tq (=185 h for the present case), the interfacial
sublayer
reached the quasiequilibrium state. We also confirmed that the in-plane
ordering among C⊥ cylinders in the quasiequilibrium
interfacial sublayers remains poor, as will be later discussed with
the GISAXS results.

By adding two additional logarithmic growths
at tc < tan < ti (“Intermediate I”)
and at ti < tan < tq (“Intermediate
II”), the growth of the
SEBS interfacial sublayer can be categorized as follows: 1  where hc, hd, and hq are the
thicknesses at tc, ti, and tq, respectively, and Πc and Πi are the logarithmic growth rates
after reaching tc and ti, respectively. The best fits to the data shown in Figure 4 gave Πc = 3.90 nm and Πi = 1.66 nm. Note that the
surfaces of the interfacial sublayers during the intermediate I regime
(i.e., tc < tan < ti) were inhomogeneous
and roughened (Figure 5). Hence, the thicknesses obtained by ellipsometry/XR represent the
average values. The thickness of the quasiequilibrium interfacial
sublayer was hq = 11.0 ± 0.4 nm based
on the XR experiments shown in Figure 3a.

GISAXS data further characterized the cylindrical
microdomain formed
in the quasiequilibrium interfacial sublayer at tan > tq. Figure 6 shows the 2D GISAXS data (Figure 6a) for the quasiequilibrium
interfacial sublayer with tan = 185 h
and the corresponding 1D profile (Figure 6b) measured at room temperature. The 2D image
showed a streak at qxy = 0.20 nm–1. In conjunction with the AFM image
shown in Figure 5e,
it is reasonable to conclude that the streak is attributed to the
presence of C⊥ cylinders within the quasiequilibrium
interfacial sublayer. The broad peak at qxy ≈ 0.4 nm–1 in the 1D profile
(Figure 6b) then suggests
the √4 peak of hexagonal packed cylindrical microdomains in
the quasiequilibrium interfacial sublayer. However, further studies
are needed to clarify the domain packing. Interestingly, L0 calculated from the first-order peak position was 30.8
± 0.5 nm, which is slightly larger than that in the thin film
or the bulk (L0,bulk = 28 nm). Additionally,
the very broadened peaks suggest the low degree of in-plane ordering
among C⊥ cylinders in the quasiequilibrium interfacial
sublayers. It is likely that the strong pinning of the SEBS segments
on the Si substrate prevents the self-assembly into well-ordered microdomain
structures. Meanwhile, the average size of the cylinders (Rcyl) in the quasiequilibrium interfacial sublayer
was estimated to be about Rcyl = 9 nm
based on the AFM result (Figure 5e), which is quite smaller than that in the 28 nm or
84 nm thick film (Rcyl = 13 nm). This
may arise from the additional entropic penalty of stretching the adsorbed
chains that affects phase separation into PS microdomains in the PEB
matrix.

2.3 Correlation between SEBS
Microdomains and
Irreversible Chain Adsorption
Having revealed the formation
of the SEBS interfacial sublayer on the non-neutral solid substrate,
we now focus on the effect on the formation of cylindrical microdomains
in the SEBS thin film. As clarified above, the microdomain structures
formed in the interfacial sublayer are distorted, and both the domain
spacing and cylinder size are different from those in the bulk. We
therefore hypothesize that, during the thermal annealing process,
unadsorbed neighboring chains, which are in contact with the loosely
adsorbed chains within the interfacial sublayer, phase-separate into
cylindrical microdomains having the same orientation (C⊥) as that of the loosely adsorbed chains so as to maximize the contact
area, thereby lowering the interfacial energy. However, the “incommensurability”
in the microdomain structures between the loosely adsorbed chains
and neighboring unadsorbed chains would cause unwanted high interfacial
energy.51 Furthermore, the incommensurability
effect can propagate into the film interior through chain entanglements
between the loosely adsorbed chains and unadsorbed neighboring chains,
as will be discussed below.

On the other hand, as shown in Figure 1, when the film is
sufficiently thick (e.g., 84 nm thick), the morphology of the topmost
surface is typically governed by the surface effect because of lower
surface tension of the PS blocks (i.e., a parallel orientation). To
discuss the competition between free surface effect and substrate
effect within the SEBS thin film, we uncovered the subsurface internal
microdomain structures using an oxygen plasma etching method. The
experiments were conducted using oxygen plasma (20 W, 100 mTorr) in
a reactive ion etcher (CS-1701, March Plasma, Inc.). Two 84 nm thick
SEBS films on the Si substrates were prepared and then annealed at
150 °C for 3 and 96 h, separately. With 5 s etching, we could
remove an about 10 nm thick layer from the topmost surface of the
film. As shown in Figure 7a, the etched SEBS film with pre-annealing of 3 h showed C∥ cylinders. On the other hand, C⊥ cylinders were dominant at the etched surface of the 84 nm thick
film after pre-annealing of 96 h (Figure 7b). These data suggest that the effect of
the loosely adsorbed chains (i.e., the formation of C⊥ cylinders) propagates at least 70 nm into the film from the substrate
surface, overwhelming the free surface effect that favors C∥ cylinders. In addition, the results imply that the distance of the
long-range perturbation associated with the loosely adsorbed chains
is strongly correlated with the adsorption process: as the loosely
adsorbed chains grow with annealing time, the substrate effect propagates
further into the film interior.

Figure 7 AFM phase images of the 84 nm thick SEBS
films with (a) tan = 3 h and (b) tan = 96 h on the Si substrates after oxygen
plasma etching for 5 s.
The scan sizes and the scales of the phase images are 1 × 1 μm
and ±2°, respectively.

It is interesting to mention that for the 28 nm thick SEBS
film
where the substrate effect is dominant, the orientation of the microdomain
structure at the topmost surface tends to switch from perpendicular
to parallel with time (Figure 1). This suggests that the formation of C⊥ cylinders is first provoked at the topmost surface because of the
substrate field effect, but the free surface effect gradually becomes
dominant at the topmost surface. As shown in Figure 1, the kinetics to switch to C∥ cylinders at the topmost surface is very sluggish, although the
more enhanced segmental mobility is anticipated at the free surface
compared to the bulk.52,53 Such mixed microdomain orientations
within BCP thin films were previously reported when one of the blocks
has a preferential interaction at one interface and a nonpreferential
interaction at the other interface.54−57 As also indicated from Figure 1, when the thickness
of the SEBS thin film is beyond the distance of the long-range perturbation
(∼70 nm), the surface effect is dominant at the topmost surface
even after the short annealing time. We expect that the propagation
distance is system-dependent.58−62 Detailed studies on a correlation among the long-range propagation
of the substrate field effect, the growth of the loosely adsorbed
chain, and the polymer–solid/polymer–air interactions
deserve future work to establish a more comprehensive understanding
of self-assembly of BCP thin films on non-neutral surfaces.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we revealed the formation
mechanism of the cylindrical-forming
SEBS thin film on a non-neutral solid surface. The optimized solvent
rinsing approach in conjunction with XR and ellipsometry experiments
allowed us to identify the formation of two different adsorbed chains:
the outer loosely adsorbed chains that formed cylindrical microdomains
in the direction perpendicular to the substrate surface and the inner
flattened chains with a percolating-like network structure. It was
also found that the kinetics is sluggish, and the cylinders formed
with the loosely adsorbed chains have poor in-plane ordering among
them, with the cylinder size and the interdomain spacing being different
from those in the thin film. We also found that the effect of the
loosely adsorbed chains propagates into the film interior via chain
entanglements with the neighboring unadsorbed chains, leading to the
formation of substrate-directed perpendicular-oriented cylinders for
at least 70 nm from the substrate surface. This substrate field effect
associated with the loosely adsorbed chains is dominant within the
length scale over the free surface effect that induces parallel-oriented
cylinders at the air–polymer interface. These findings suggest
that the irreversible adsorption of constituent blocks on a non-neutral
solid is critical for designing BCP thin film-based applications and
technologies. This research is also reminiscent of the importance
of surface modifications in directing well-ordered microdomain structures
in BCP thin films. We are currently investigating the use of flattened
chains composed of one of the constituent blocks as an alternative
polymer coating for directed self-assembly of BCP thin films. The
details will be summarized as a forthcoming publication.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
A cylinder-forming
SEBS (Mw = 85 000 g/mol, Mw/Mn = 2.4, donated by Asahi-Kasei
Chemical Corp) triblock copolymer was used. Such a relatively large
polydispersity index is often considered as an undesirable feature
that complicates quantitative studies of structures and dynamics of
macromolecules. According to Guiselin’s original work,21 adsorbed chains with multiple solid-segment
contacts can be considered as a “very polydisperse pseudobrush”,
and this was also validated experimentally.32 In addition, we proved that the structures of the physisorbed polymer
layers remain unchanged with different degrees of Mw/Mn (at least up to Mw/Mn = 2.7).32 Hence, the effect of the relatively large polydispersity
of SEBS on the structure of the adsorbed polymer layer can be ignored.
The weight fraction of the polystyrene (PS) component was 0.18. Small
angle X-ray scattering experiments at the CMS beamline (NSLS-II, BNL)
verified that the bulk SEBS sample does not exhibit the order–disorder
transition within a wide temperature range of 25–200 °C.
The characteristic period of cylinders (or interdomain spacing, L0) in the bulk was determined to be L0,bulk = 28 nm at 25 °C (Figure S3). Silicon (Si) substrates (University Wafer Inc.)
were treated with hot piranha solution for 30 min before being rinsed
with deionized water. The cleaned Si wafers were then submerged in
an aqueous solution of hydrogen fluoride (HF) for 20 s to remove the
native oxide (SiOx) layer. However, we
confirmed that a SiOx layer (∼1
nm in thickness) was reproduced immediately after the HF etching,
as reported previously.22,24,26,63 The HF-etched Si exhibited more
hydrophobic nature compared to a non-HF Si substrate, giving a water
contact angle of 82 ± 1°.26 We
prepared SEBS thin films with average thicknesses ht = nL0, where n is an integer, onto the HF-etched Si substrates by spin coating
of a SEBS/toluene solution. The thicknesses of the spin-cast SEBS
thin films were measured by XR or an ellipsometer (Rudolf Auto EL-II)
with the given refractive index of 1.516. According to previous studies,
polybutadiene (PB) exhibits more attraction to SiOx than PS.64−69 It is hence expected that the PEB block has a stronger affinity
to the Si substrate than the PS block. On the other hand, because
PS has a relatively lower surface energy compared to PEB, PS preferentially
wets to the air interface. Hence, a SEBS thin film on the Si substrate
is categorized as an asymmetric wetting condition, which requires
the film thickness (ht) of (n + 1/2)L0 to prepare stable, supported
thin films.70 However, as shown in Figure 1, SEBS thin films
with ht = L0 and ht = 3L0 were stable during the prolonged thermal annealing process and typical
topological features caused by the mismatching film thickness, such
as islands, holes, or terraces, were not present at the film surfaces.
Spin-cast films were thermally annealed at 150 °C for different
times in an oil-free vacuum oven at a pressure below 10–3 Torr.

To investigate the irreversible adsorption of SEBS chains
on the HF-etched Si substrate, the thermally annealed SEBS thin films
were rinsed with fresh toluene or chloroform at room temperature until
the residual film thickness remained unchanged (typically a total
of 3–5 cycles with 30 min per cycle). The choice of solvents
was based on previous studies on the extraction of loosely adsorbed
chains or flattened chains from homopolymer PS or PB thin films.22,24,26 The solvent-rinsing with toluene
removes the unadsorbed chains but leaves both the inner flattened
chains and outer loosely adsorbed chains on the Si surface. We assign
the residual layer composed of both the inner flattened chains and
outer loosely adsorbed chains as an interfacial sublayer. To
uncover the inner flattened chains, chloroform, a better solvent for
SEBS than toluene, was utilized. We refer to the resulting layer composed
of the lone flattened chains as a flattened layer. This selective
extraction of the two different adsorbed chains is attributed to the
large difference in desorption energy between the outer loosely adsorbed
chains and the inner flattened chains, which is linearly dependent
on the number of segment–surface contacts.45,46 The resultant adsorbed layers (i.e., the flattened layers and interfacial
sublayers) were annealed at 150 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven
at a pressure below 10–3 Torr to remove any excess
solvent trapped before further experiments.

4.2 GISAXS
Measurements
GISAXS measurements
were carried out at the X9 beamline at the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS, BNL). 2D scattering patterns were collected by using
a MAR-CCD area detector with the sample-to-detector distance of 495
cm. Intensity profiles were measured as a function of the scattering
vector, q = (4π sin θ)/λ, where
θ is the scattering angle and λ is the X-ray wavelength
(λ = 0.092 nm). The incident angle was set to 0.12°, which
is above the critical angle of SEBS (i.e., 0.1°) to observe the
entire structure within the film. All measurements were carried out
under vacuum (∼10–3 Torr) with a temperature-controlled
sample stage interfaced with a Lakeshore 340 unit. The exposure time
was fixed to 200 s. The 2D GISAXS patterns were transformed into 1D
profiles along the qxy-direction at qz = 0.15
nm–1, with qxy and qz being
the scattering vectors in the parallel and perpendicular directions
to the film surface, respectively.

4.3 XR Measurements
XR measurements were
performed at the X20A beamline (NSLS). Specular reflectivity profiles
were measured as a function of qz = (4π sin θ)/λ, where θ is the incident
angle and λ is the X-ray wavelength (λ = 0.118 nm). The
XR data, corrected for the background scattering, was analyzed by
comparing the observed reflectivities with calculated ones based on
model profiles with three fitting parameters: film thickness, a dispersion
value (δ in the X-ray refractive index), and interfacial roughness.
To identify the two-layer formation within the interfacial sublayer,
we used a standard multilayer fitting routine for a dispersion value
in conjunction with a Fourier method.71,72 For the X-ray
energy used (10.5 keV), the δ value of the SEBS is estimated
to be δbulk = 1.96 × 10–6 with
the density of 0.95 g/cm3.

4.4 AFM Measurements
The SEBS used in
this study forms hexagonally packed PS cylinders embedded in a soft
EB matrix. A phase contrast can visualize such a structure under a
tapping mode AFM. Standard tapping mode AFM (Digital Nanoscope III)
using a cantilever with a spring constant of ∼40 N/m and a
resonant frequency of ∼300 kHz was used to characterize the
surface morphologies of the SEBS thin films and adsorbed layers. The
scan rate was 1.0 Hz with the scanning density of 256 or 512 lines
per frame.
