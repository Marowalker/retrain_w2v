Herein,
we report a comprehensive study on the interaction of three
protomeric forms of the antibacterial drug norfloxacin (nfx) with
the enzymatic protein human lysozyme (lyz). Norfloxacin, having the
option for two-stage acid–base equilibria, converts from cationic
(nfx+) to zwitterionic (nfx±) form, followed
by an anionic (nfx–) species, with increasing pH.
Among these protomeric forms, lysozyme binds nfx± most
robustly, whereas nfx– has a weak association and
nfx+ does not show any interaction. In lysozyme, the location
of the drug was ascertained by competitive binding assay with 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate,
and this was further examined with molecular docking simulation. The
binding process was found to be primarily governed by hydrogen bonding
and van der Waals interactions. The study has further revealed that
preferential binding of nfx± by the protein over nfx– led to a switchover of nfx– to nfx±; and the resulting increased population of nfx± over the other is beneficial for the pharmacological activity of
the drug in terms of its accumulation in the target bacterial cells.
The present study accomplishes two important objectives. It holds
significance regarding the differential interaction of multiprotomeric
drugs with biomolecules, such as proteins, enzymes, lipid membranes,
etc., and also on such biomolecule-assisted alteration of the acid–base
equilibrium and consequent bioavailability of the drug. The findings
are useful from the viewpoints of dispensation, distribution, and
metabolism of any prototropic drug in living systems as they encounter
several biomolecules in vivo. Another importance of this work stems
from the study of comparative binding responses of lysozyme toward
a drug existing in multiple forms depending on its protonation states
or some other chemical processes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Norfloxacin (nfx), a fluoroquinolone
class of drug, displays a
wide range of antibacterial activity on both gram positive and gram
negative bacteria by inhibiting the DNA synthesis and promoting cleavage
of bacterial DNA in the DNA–enzyme complexes of DNA gyrase
and type IV topoisomerase, and hence resulting in rapid bacterial
death.1 It is widely used to treat several
diseases like skin infection, urinary tract infection, prostatitis,
sexually transmitted diseases, gastroenteritis, and some skin and
soft tissue infections.1−4 Quinolone drugs get widely distributed throughout the body. Their
penetration into prostatic fluid, saliva, bone, and cerebrospinal
fluid is also good enough.5 Norfloxacin,
having two acid–base equilibria, exhibits three prototropic
forms depending on the pH of the immediate environment. In the case
of such prototropic drugs, some specific ionized form of the molecule
is very important for its action. It is known that the zwitterionic
form of norfloxacin crosses the gastrointestinal and other lipid membranes
by passive diffusion, presenting themselves as neutral molecules in
antiparallely stacked arrangements.6 The
interaction of drug molecules with relevant biomolecules like a protein
has always been of great importance in the dynamic research discipline,
specifically in dealing with important issues like drug dispensation,
free concentration, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of a drug in
the blood stream. Fluoroquinolones being a crucial class of antibacterial
drugs, their interaction with biological or biomimicking targets is
an important issue relating to their mechanism of action in the animal
body system. There are reports on the interaction of the norfloxacin
with biomolecules like protein, DNA, and biomimicking agents like
cell-membrane-mimicking liposomes and differently charged micelles.7−12 The reports on the interaction of norfloxacin with biomolecules
are mostly focused on the binding of the drug molecule at physiological
pH condition only (where it exists predominantly as a zwitterionic
form). A recent study performed on the interaction of nfx with human
serum albumin at physiological pH (only zwitterionic form of nfx was
focused upon) shows that the drug undergoes a zwitterionic to cationic
transformation.10 Here, we have explored
a long acidic to alkaline pH range in obtaining a comprehensive idea
on the interaction of all the three protomeric states of norfloxacin
with lysozyme (lyz). Analyzing the spectral behavior of the drug in
the presence of lyz, we also scrutinized if the acid–base equilibrium
of the drug has been altered while interacting with the concerned
protein. In the following section, we have briefly discussed the importance
of lysozyme and the relevance of choosing the same as the host biomolecule
for our present study.

Lysozyme, being an antimicrobial enzyme,
is a part of the animal
innate immune system and is found in various tissues and in some protecting
secretions like tears, saliva, mucus, milk, etc. The enzymatic protein
acts by damaging the bacterial cell walls via cleavage of the β-glycosidic
linkage between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine in peptidoglycan and thereby protecting
against bacterial infections.13,14 It is a single-chain
globular protein consisting of 130 amino acid residues. The active
site of the protein has a crevice that separates the protein into
two domains connected by an α-helix.13 One domain consists mostly of β-sheet conformations (40–80
amino acids), whereas the other domain (89–99 amino acids)
is more α-helical in nature.15 Lysozyme
has widely been chosen as a model protein to study and understand
folding and dynamics, structure–function relationships, and
ligand–protein interactions due to its small size, high stability,
and natural abundance.16,17 It is well known for its capability
to reversibly bind a number of endogenous and exogenous compounds,
including some important drug molecules.18 Regarding the drug binding properties of any biomolecule, it is
an important aspect to know its binding selectivity when more than
one species of a drug molecule are present there. In connection with
the binding preference between two protomeric species of a particular
ligand by the very well known carrier protein serum albumins, it has
been extensively found that serum proteins have an inclination toward
anionic or neutral species over their corresponding neutral or cationic
protomers, respectively.19,20 There are very few
reports where a comparison of the binding of the individual protomers
of a ligand with lysozyme has been documented. Those studies were
performed with drug molecules (all having pKa > 7) showing only one acid–base equilibrium with
positively
charged acid forms and neutral conjugate basic protomers.21 The common finding was that lysozyme has comparatively
strong binding interaction with the neutral protomer over the cationic
one. In our study, we have chosen the drug norfloxacin having three
prototropic forms, namely, cationic, zwitterionic (neutral as a whole),
and anionic. We intend to investigate a comparative binding when lysozyme
is encountered by the three individual protomeric species of the guest
drug, which are highly probable of interacting with the enzymatic
protein in the blood stream as well as several tissues and other body
fluids.

To get a detailed scenario regarding the individual
binding affinity
of the three prototropic forms of nfx with lysozyme as well as any
effect of protein binding on the acid–base property of the
drug, a dual-sided approach via monitoring of the fluorescence emission
of the protein as well as of the drug were arranged separately. Synchronous
fluorescence spectra (SFS) of the protein and the steady-state fluorescence
anisotropy of the drug molecule were also probed, and the results
are in good agreement with the fluorescence quenching result of lyz.
Binding thermodynamics of the most preferred protomer of nfx with
lysozyme was explored by the fluorimetric temperature variation method
via the van’t Hoff equation. A most probable binding location
of the drug inside the protein scaffold was modeled by a molecular
blind-docking simulation. The result obtained from the docking simulation
in terms of intermolecular energy also corroborates nicely with the
experimental results.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 pH-Dependent Spectral Features of Norfloxacin
Norfloxacin
exhibits acid–base equilibria in aqueous medium
involving three protomeric forms in a pH range ∼5–9.2.
It has two acid dissociation constants in aqueous medium and the corresponding
pKa values are pKa1 = 6.2 and pKa2 = 8.5. When pH
is below pKa1, it exists predominantly
as a cationic form (nfx+) protonated at the piperzinyl
nitrogen, and above pKa1, the deprotonation
from the carboxylic group produces a zwitterionic form (nfx±). Further above pKa2, the anionic form
(nfx–) arising out of deprotonation at both piperzinyl
and carboxylic moiety prevails (Figure 1a). The representative pH-dependent absorbance and
emission spectral profile of nfx at some selected pH is highlighted
in Figure 1b. nfx+ shows a strong absorption peak at ∼276 nm along with
two subpeaks at ∼316 and ∼330 nm. The other two forms,
nfx± and nfx– have identical absorbance
spectral profiles showing the strong absorption peak at ∼271
nm along with the two other subpeak positions at ∼322 and ∼335
nm. nfx+ has fluorescence emission maxima positioned at
∼442 nm. With increase in pH, the emission maxima shift toward
shorter wavelength accompanied by a little decrease in the fluorescence
intensity. The nfx±-form shows emission maxima at
∼414 nm. Then, with increasing pH, nfx± converts
to nfx– with substantial lowering in emission intensity,
along with a red shift in the emission maxima (emission maxima of
nfx– comes at ∼435 nm, at pH 9.2), and beyond
pH 10 the species becomes practically nonfluorescent.

2.2 Fluorescence
Emission Spectral Modulation
of Norfloxacin in the Presence of Lysozyme
Monitoring of
fluorescence emission spectra is a widely used tool to explore the
protein–ligand interaction process. For our protein–ligand
pair, the protein lyz and the drug nfx both are fluorescent. Here,
we utilized fluorescence spectral properties of both the drug and
the protein individually to obtain detailed information on the interaction
process. In this section, we will discuss the emission spectral response
of nfx to understand the behavior of the three distinct protomers
of nfx in the presence of lysozyme. Emissions were measured at three
selected pHs: 4.2, 7.2, and 9.2, where nfx exists predominantly as
nfx+, nfx±, and nfx–,
respectively. There was no alteration in the emission spectra of nfx+ (Figure 2a)
in the presence of lyz, indicating no substantial interaction of this
cationic form with the protein. This seems reasonable as lyz has net
positive charge (as the isoelectric point of lyz is ∼11.35)
at this acidic pH (4.2); hence, the positively charged cationic drug
molecule is improbable of binding to the protein. On the other hand,
the addition of lysozyme to nfx± (at pH 7.2, having
emission peak λmax = 413 nm) resulted in a slight
decrease in emission intensity, along with an isoemissive point near
∼440 nm, and a ∼4 nm red shift of the emission maxima
(Figure 2b). Several
models could be postulated to account for this observation at pH 7.2.
One could be due to a switchover of nfx± to nfx+, as the cationic form has an emission maxima that is red-shifted
compared to nfx± itself. Another possibility is a
switchover of nfx± to nfx– with
weaker emission in the red side of the spectrum. Otherwise, it might
be due to a binding interaction of nfx± with the protein.
The first possibility could be discarded as nfx+ has a
stronger emission intensity compared to nfx±, whereas
here, we see a little quenching in nfx± emission upon
lyz addition. Moreover, from our earlier fluorescence emission spectral
measurements, it is observed that the protein does not show any perceptible
binding interaction toward nfx+. Fluorescence excitation
and UV–vis spectral study also supported that as there was
no alteration in the absorbance spectrum of nfx± (inset
of Figure 2b). The
second possibility (transformation of nfx± to nfx–) is also quite unlikely if we look into the pH-dependent
emission spectra of nfx. In the aqueous medium, nfx (Figure 1b) does not show any isoemissive
point, which should have been present as a characteristic during the
transition from nfx± to nfx–. Absorbance
spectra/excitation spectra or fluorescence lifetime data cannot be
helpful for this case, as both these forms (nfx± or
nfx–) have very similar spectral characteristics.
The other possibility is that there might be a binding interaction
with lyz, resulting in quenching of fluorescence of the drug. In that
case, the appearance of the isoemissive point near 440 nm may arise
out of equilibrium between the protein-bound and unbound forms of
nfx±. Although the observation of a little quenching
of emission intensity in the presence of protein is somewhat unusual,
as in most of the cases, fluorescence enhancement of a ligand inside
a protein is a familiar phenomenon,22,23 but there
are instances where quenching rather than fluorescence enhancement
has been reported, and those were attributed to be due to the operation
of some hydrogen-bonding interaction or some nonspecific interaction
within the host molecule.19,20,24 The emission of nfx– (at pH 9.2) was also studied
upon lyz addition (Figure 2c).

Figure 2 Fluorescence emission spectra of (a) nfx+ (at pH 4.2),
(b) nfx± (at pH 7.2), and (c) nfx– (at pH 9.2) in presence of different lysozyme concentrations at
298 K. λexc = 331 nm. The corresponding absorption
spectra are presented as inset figures. (The data shown here are difference
absorption spectra obtained after subtracting the absorption spectral
profile of lysozyme solution.)

The initial weak intensity emission of the anionic protomer
progressively
becomes intensified accompanied by a shift of the emission maxima
from ∼430 to ∼417 nm upon addition of lyz. Again, two
possibilities may be suggested for such fluorescence enhancement and
blue shifting of emission maxima of nfx– with increasing
lyz concentration. It might be due to the incorporation of nfx– in lyz because of strong binding interaction, as inside
the protein pocket fluorescence enhancement and blue shift of emission
spectrum are usual phenomena. The other possibility is a prototropic
switchover from nfx– to nfx±, as
the enhanced emission intensity as well as the emission maxima (changes
from 430 to 417 nm) at highest lyz concentration are exactly similar
to that of the nfx± form. Moreover, the fluorescence
spectral pattern, with increasing lyz concentration, is also similar
to that of the pH-dependent emission profile of nfx during conversion
of nfx– to nfx± in neat aqueous
media. Again, in this case also, the absorbance spectra or fluorescence
lifetime decay data cannot provide any conclusion due to identical
spectral features. The absorbance spectra of the three different forms
of nfx in the presence of lysozyme have been shown in the insets of Figure 2. Because of the
strong interference of lysozyme in the shorter wavelength region,
the absorbance spectra are shown here in the longer wavelength region
only. At this stage, to get a clear picture, an approach from the
other side was adopted, where the fluorescence-quenching experiment
of lysozyme in the presence of nfx was monitored at pHs 7.2 and 9.2
to explore the absolute binding efficacy of nfx± or
nfx– with the protein. This information will also
provide an idea if any of these two protomeric forms is getting converted
to the other having a relatively higher binding affinity with lysozyme.
In this counter study, utilizing the protein’s intrinsic fluorescence
at those two pH, the two protomeric forms of the drug will be entirely
in their respective protonation states (i.e., no possibility of prototropic
switchover), as the concentration of lyz will be kept fixed there
and the concentration of the drug will be altered.

2.3 Quenching of Lysozyme Fluorescence in the
Presence of Norfloxacin
The intrinsic fluorophores inside
protein are sensitive to their immediate microenvironment. So, any
exogenous ligand-induced perturbation of the microenvironment leads
to an alteration of the emission characteristics of the fluorophores.
To get insight into the interaction of norfloxacin (nfx± and nfx–) with lysozyme, intrinsic tryptophan
fluorescence of the protein was investigated at pHs 7.2 and 9.2 in
the presence of the drug (Figure 3a,b, respectively). As evident from the previous section
that the cationic form of the drug does not interact with the protein,
the quenching study of lysozyme in the presence of nfx+ was not attempted. Before working with the tryptophan fluorescence
of the protein in a range of pH, it is important to check if there
is any conformational alteration of the protein with pH. Employing
optical rotation measurements, previous studies in the literature
have already shown that in the pH range (∼4 to ∼9) that
we worked in, the conformation of lysozyme remains practically unaltered.21,25 Although this was investigated with the chicken egg variety of lysozyme,
the behavior of the human lysozyme should be very similar to it, as
both of them share a high percentage of sequence homology. Hence,
the human variety of lysozyme is expected to have a very similar secondary
structure.26 In this study also, the ellipticity
values, as obtained from circular dichroism (CD) spectral data, show
that there is hardly any conformational alteration with the change
of pH (ellipticity values obtained at the two pHs 7.2 and 9.2 are
19.82 and 19.56 mdeg, respectively). On the other hand, we observed
some variation in fluorescence spectra of lysozyme in the concerned
pH range (Figure 4).
In the human lysozyme, Trp64 and Trp109 are the most dominant contributors
toward its overall tryptophan fluorescence.27 This figure shows that the two characteristic parameters, emission
intensity and emission maxima of spectra, are nearly same in the pH
range ∼4.4 to ∼8.0, whereas the emission intensity is
quenched to some extent and the emission maxima is shifted toward
longer wavelength by ∼3 nm (from ∼342 to ∼345
nm) on moving to pH 9.2. This spectral change at the alkaline pH well
complements the previously reported studies,26 which accounted that the quenching and spectral shifts occur due
to the ionization of the nearby tyrosine residue (Tyr63). Hence, it
could be inferred that depending on the pH, there are changes in the
ionization state of the amino acid side chains, which is reflected
in the emission spectra of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorophores,
whereas the conformation of the protein remains unaltered. Now, we
discuss the exogenous ligand-induced (here, drug nfx) perturbation
of lyz intrinsic fluorescence. The changes in the microenvironment
around tryptophan due to ligand interaction may lead to alteration
in its fluorescence spectral profile depending on the nature and strength
of ligand binding. Here, nfx± and nfx– concentrations were varied keeping lyz concentration at 1.0 μM.
Upon addition of nfx, it was found that both nfx± and
nfx– have quenched the emission of lyz but the extent
of quenching was different for the two forms.

Figure 3 Fluorescence spectra
of lyz (1 μM) upon addition of (a) nfx± (at
pH 7.2) and (b) nfx– (at pH 9.2)
at 298 K. λexc = 295 nm. Norfloxacin concentration
was varied from 0 M to 5.48 μM (in figure: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.48
μM) for both of the cases. All data are not presented in the
figure for clarity.

Figure 4 Fluorescence emission
spectra of lysozyme as a function of pH.

In the presence of nfx±, a red shift of 5
nm (from
342 to 347 nm, at maximum added nfx± concentration)
in the emission maxima of lyz was observed, whereas in the presence
of nfx–, a red shift by 2 nm (emission maxima shifts
from 346 to 348 nm, at maximum added nfx– concentration)
was observed. The greater shifting of the emission maxima of lyz in
presence of nfx± compared to that of nfx– indicates that the microenvironment of the lyz fluorophore (internal
tryptophan) gets altered to a greater extent while interacting with
nfx± than with nfx–. The extent
of fluorescence quenching, which helps in estimating the interaction
affinity of ligand with protein, is quantified by the well-known Stern–Volmer
equation (eq 1)28 1  where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities at emission
maxima (here
at λmax = 342 nm) without the quencher and in presence
of different quencher concentrations ([Q]); kq, KSV, and ⟨τ⟩0 are the bimolecular quenching rate constant, the Stern–Volmer
quenching constant, and average fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore
in the absence of any quencher, respectively. The representative Stern–Volmer
plots at both the pHs 7.2 and 9.2 are provided in Figure 5. A very small quenching of
the protein fluorescence for nfx– suggests a weak
binding interaction between these two. The kq and KSV values obtained from
the linear plots are shown in Table 1. The KSV estimated for
both nfx± and nfx– binding to lyz
clearly indicates that nfx± has a substantially stronger
binding affinity for lysozyme (KSV is
∼2.5 times greater for nfx± compared to nfx–).

The linear nature of quenching with quencher concentration
may
arise due to the involvement of either static quenching or dynamic
quenching mechanisms. Static quenching occurs when there is ground
state dark complex formation between the fluorophore and the quencher,
whereas dynamic or collisional quenching arises due to collision between
the excited fluorophore and the ground state quencher.28 To explore the quenching mechanism operating
in the present case, time-resolved fluorescence decay analysis was
performed for lyz fluorescence in the absence and presence of the
drug molecule, and the decay profiles are displayed in Figure 6. The corresponding decay parameters
are shown in Table 2. The operation of the dynamic quenching mechanism should lower the
average lifetime of the fluorophore with increasing quencher concentration,
showing an increase of ⟨τ⟩0/⟨τ⟩q (⟨τ⟩q is the average lifetime
of fluorophore at any quencher concentration, [Q]).
On the other hand, the static quenching will keep ⟨τ⟩0/⟨τ⟩q nearly constant with
the quencher concentration, as ⟨τ⟩q will hardly alter. The lifetime parameters listed in Table 2 show that there is almost no
alteration in the average lifetime of lyz (at both the pH), and the
individual decay components are also practically unchanged with the
drug concentration. Hence, it can be inferred that the observed fluorescence
quenching of lyz upon norfloxacin addition is static in nature, forming
a ground state complex. Moreover, the bimolecular quenching rate constants, kq (= KSV/⟨τ⟩0; ⟨τ⟩0 of lyz obtained ∼0.860
ns) obtained from the Stern–Volmer plot (Table 1 and Figure 5) are in the order of ∼1013 M–1 s–1, and these are much higher
than typical diffusion-controlled quenching rate constants29 observed (in the order of ∼1010 M–1 s–1) at room temperature
in fluids. Hence, these findings also nullify the possibility of dynamic
quenching.

2.4 Evaluation of Binding Parameters
To obtain a quantitative
account on the binding interaction of nfx± or nfx– with the protein, the binding
constants (K) as well as ΔG° values were estimated. Using fluorescence quenching data, eq 2 was employed30,31 2  which
yields binding constant (K) and number of binding
sites (n) in cases that
involve small molecules binding independently to a set of identical
sites on a macromolecule.30,32 Representative plots
using the eq 2 are shown
in Figure 7a,b.

Figure 7 Double logarithm
plots for estimation of binding constants for
complexation of (a) nfx±–lyz (at pH 7.2) and
(b) nfx––lyz (at pH 9.2) at 298 K.

The binding parameters at 25 °C
at both the pH are tabulated
in Table 1. The linear
nature of the plots gives the “n” values
that are nearly “1” for both the cases, and it is the
indicative of the involvement of one site binding and hence a 1:1
stoichiometry. Binding stoichiometry was also evaluated from the Job’s
method33 of continuous variation (inset
of Figure 7) which
also supports the previously mentioned ∼1:1 stoichiometry.
The higher magnitude of the binding constant (K)
obtained for nfx± compared to that of nfx– clearly shows much stronger binding interaction in the case of nfx±. Consequently, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) is also higher in the case of nfx± (Table 1).

2.5 Synchronous Fluorescence Spectra of Lysozyme
in the Presence of nfx± and nfx–
Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy involves simultaneous
scanning of the excitation and emission monochromators while maintaining
a constant wavelength interval (Δλ).33 It can provide information about the change of molecular
microenvironment in the vicinity of chromophores by measuring the
shift in the emission maxima (λmax sfs), which
depends on the change in the polarity around the chromophore microenvironment.
Keeping Δλ at 15 and 60 nm, SFS can provide the characteristic
information of amino acid residues tyrosine or tryptophan, respectively,
inside protein environment. In this case, at Δλ = 15 nm,
no perceptible shift in λmax sfs of lyz was
observed in presence of both nfx± or nfx– (Figure 8a). Setting
Δλ = 60 nm, addition of nfx± (at pH 7.2)
to lysozyme results in a shifting of the λmax sfs by ∼2 nm to longer wavelength along with quenching of emission,
whereas addition of nfx– (at pH 9.2) causes ∼1
nm shift in λmax sfs to the longer wavelength
along with smaller quenching (Figure 8b). This observation is in accordance with the previous
finding that lysozyme binds nfx± more strongly than
nfx–, experiencing a bit more alteration in the
microenvironment around the fluorophore. These red shifts in λmax sfs suggest that polarity around the tryptophan fluorophore
has changed and it is experiencing a little more polar environment
due to binding of the drug.

fluorescence spectra of lysozyme at Δλ = 60 nm in the

2.6 Steady-State Anisotropy of nfx± and nfx– in the Presence of Lysozyme
Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements provide idea about
the rotational restriction arising due to the rigidity of the surroundings
of a fluorophore. Anisotropy (r) of both nfx± and nfx– were found to increase gradually
with lyz concentration followed by saturation (Figure 9). Hence, for the bound drug molecule, lysozyme
renders a motional restriction due to local environmental rigidity
in the protein scaffold compared to that in bulk aqueous medium. The
increase in the anisotropy (r), that is, increase
in motional restriction of nfx± with increasing lyz
concentration is higher than that of nfx–. Therefore,
these results from steady-state anisotropy studies also suggest the
stronger binding ability of lyz toward nfx±, corroborating
the findings of fluorescence quenching data of lysozyme.

pH 7.2) and nfx– (at pH 9.2) in increasing lysozyme
concentration, at 298 K. λexc = 331 nm and λem = 414 nm (for nfx±) and λem = 435 nm (for nfx–), at 298 K.

2.7 Thermodynamic Parameters
of nfx± Binding to Lysozyme
The thermodynamic
parameters involved
in the interaction of small organic molecules with biological macromolecule
provide a simple way to get information about the nature of binding
forces involved in the interaction process. Generally, the interaction
forces between drug molecules and biomolecules are governed by electrostatic
force, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interaction, and hydrophobic
interaction within the binding site.34 As
in our case, the nfx±-form has the strongest binding
with lysozyme, we opted for the determination of thermodynamic parameters
for nfx±-lyz association by monitoring lyz fluorescence
quenching by nfx± at three different temperatures.
The thermodynamic analysis was avoided for nfx– as
the binding efficacy was very weak, leading to a negligible quenching
of emission of lyz, and this can indeed furnish erroneous results
in a fluorescence-based temperature variation study. Assuming the
standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) as almost
unchanged in the studied temperature range, standard enthalpy change
(ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) could be estimated from the van’t Hoff equation
(eq 3)34 3  where “K” is
the binding constant at any particular temperature T, “R” is the universal gas constant.
A representative double logarithm plot for binding constant estimations
(using eq 2) at three
different temperatures is shown in Figure 10a. The respective binding constants are
tabulated in Table 3. The representative van’t Hoff plot using the eq 3 is displayed in Figure 10b. Next, by using the obtained
ΔH° and ΔS°,
the standard free energy change (ΔG°)
of the interaction process was estimated with the eq 4 4  ΔG° along with
ΔH° and ΔS°
are also listed in Table 3.

Ross and Subramanian
have pointed out that the nature of interaction
taking place in protein–ligand association processes could
be determined from the sign and magnitude of thermodynamic parameters,
and this is briefly summarized as:34 (i)
ΔH° > 0 and ΔS°
> 0 corresponds to hydrophobic force; (ii) ΔH° < 0 and ΔS0 < 0 corresponds
to van der Waals interaction and hydrogen bonding; (iii) ΔH° < 0 and ΔS° >
0 corresponds
to electrostatic interaction. The thermodynamic parameters presented
in Table 3 show that
both ΔH° and ΔS° are negative in the present case. The negative sign of ΔH° may arise if electrostatic interaction forces or
hydrogen-bond interaction, van der Waals interaction forces are in
operation. But here, ΔS° also being negative
suggests major involvement of hydrogen-bond and van der Waals interaction
forces in the association process of the drug with lysozyme. Considering
the molecular structure of norfloxacin in its zwitterionic form, the
positively charged −NH2 group with the hydrogens,
one carboxylate group, and the carbonyl oxygen atom can participate
in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the nearby amino acid residues
of lysozyme. Although the major governing forces are van der Waals,
and hydrogen-bonding interactions in the concerned binding process,
the operation of electrostatic interaction is also expected to take
place through the carboxylate moieties of nfx (for both the protomers)
with the positively charged amino acid side chains of the protein,
and via the positively charged piperzinyl moiety of nfx± with the negatively charged side chains of amino residues of lyz.

2.8 Circular Dichroism Spectra of Lysozyme in
the Presence of nfx± or nfx–
The circular dichroism (CD) spectral study of a protein informs about
its secondary structure. CD spectra of lysozyme have two negative
peaks at 208 and 222 nm characteristics of n→π* transition
in amide bond of α-helix.35 CD data
is presented in terms of mean residual ellipticity (MRE) in deg cm2 dmol–1, according to eq 5,36 where “θ”
is the observed ellipticity in mdegree, l is the
path length of the cell, cp is molar concentration
of the protein, and nr is the number of
amino acid residues in the protein. 5  Then, the α-helix content of lyz is
calculated from the MRE value at 208 nm, using eq 6.37 6  where MRE208 is the experimental
MRE value of protein at 208 nm, 4000 is the MRE value of the β-form
and random coil conformation at 208 nm, and 33 000 is the MRE
value of a pure α-helix at 208 nm. In this case, the presence
of both nfx± and nfx– increases
the α-helix content of lysozyme to some extent (Figure 11). The estimated percentage
α-helix content of lysozyme at pHs 7.2 and 9.2 in the absence
and presence of nfx± or nfx– have
been tabulated in Table 4. Such an increase in the helical content of lyz in presence of nfx± or nfx– suggests that the secondary
structure of the protein is perturbed to some extent upon binding
of the aforementioned protomeric forms of norfloxacin.

2.9 Competitive Binding Assay with 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate
(ANS)
8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) is a well-known
fluorescent probe for sensing the changes in the hydrophobicity in
its immediate microenvironment. ANS has been reported to strongly
bind to the hydrophobic cleft of lysozyme, exhibiting enhancement
in the fluorescence quantum yield with a blue shift in the emission
maxima and hence has been chosen to follow the competitive binding
with any other lysozyme-binding ligand.21,38 Here, we monitored
the environment-sensitive fluorescence of ANS to probe the potential
binding site of norfloxacin (nfx± and nfx–) in lysozyme. In this assay, ANS (2 μM) was initially allowed
to bind with lyz (2 μM) in a 1:1 ratio. At pH 7.2, the emission
intensity of ANS increases along with blue shift of the emission maxima
from ∼524 to ∼512 nm (Figure 12a), which is due to partitioning of the
probe from bulk aqueous phase to the hydrophobic pocket of lysozyme.
Successive addition of nfx± to the lyz-bound ANS reduces
the emission intensity of the probe and shifts the emission maxima
to ∼521 nm at the maximum added nfx± concentration
(Figure 12a). Similarly,
at pH 9.2, the fluorescence intensity of ANS enhances upon binding
with lyz, along with a shift of the emission maxima from ∼524
to ∼514 nm (Figure 12b). Later on, the addition of nfx– to the
lysozyme-bound ANS reduces the emission intensity with a shift of
the band, and here the emission maximum shifts to ∼520 nm at
the maximum nfx– concentration (Figure 12b). Thus, the observations
with protein-bound ANS fluorescence spectra upon addition of nfx± or nfx– clearly indicate that ANS
gets displaced from the binding site of lyz and returns to the bulk
aqueous medium; that is, nfx competes with ANS for the same binding
site in lysozyme. The binding location is further inspected by molecular
docking simulations, as discussed later.

and presence of lyz, and upon subsequent addition of (a) nfx± (at pH 7.2) and (b) nfx– (at pH 9.2) at 298 K.
λexc = 380 nm.

2.10 Molecular Docking Study
Finding
out the location of the bound drug molecule inside the protein macromolecule
is also very much important for a complete study of the concerned
drug–protein interaction process. Herein, the most probable
binding site for both nfx± and nfx– inside lyz was explored with AutoDock-based blind-docking simulation,
as mentioned in detail in Section 4. Both the protomeric species of nfx were docked into
the three-dimensional (3D) crystal of lyz. Several literatures are
available regarding binding of different ligands and antigens to the
active catalytic site of lyz.38−40 The energetically favorable docked
conformation of both the protomers of nfx inside lyz are depicted
in Figure 13. The
amino acid residues in the close vicinity (within 4 Å) of nfx± are: Glu35, Asp53, Gln58, Asn60, Tyr63, Trp64, Val99,
Gln104, Ala108, Trp109, Val110, and Ala111, and for nfx–, the involved residues are: Glu35, Asp53, Ala59, Gln58, Asn60, Tyr63,
Trp64, Ala108, Trp109, Val110, and Ala111. These mentioned amino acid
residues are located in the substrate binding region of lyz.13 Therefore, it could be inferred that both the
protomers dock near the substrate binding site of the protein. The
observed quenching of tryptophan fluorescence and shift in synchronous
fluorescence maxima in lyz could be attributed to the interaction
of the drug with Trp64 and Trp109 located in the binding region inside
lyz. In a protein–ligand binding, depending on the nature of
the amino acid residues present around the ligand, the side chains
can offer different kinds of interaction forces. The associated intermolecular
energy, as obtained from docking result, can provide some idea about
involved binding forces. In this case, the associated intermolecular
energy, as obtained from the docking result for nfx±–lyz association, was found to be −5.66 kcal mol–1, in which electrostatic interaction energy contributes
−1.42 kcal mol–1 and van der Waals, hydrogen-bonding
interaction energy contribute −4.24 kcal mol–1. Hence, the higher contribution is coming from the van der Waals,
hydrogen-bonding interaction energy to the total intermolecular energy,
and this corroborates very well with the previously discussed thermodynamic
data obtained from fluorimetric temperature variation method for nfx± binding to lysozyme. As displayed in the docked pose,
the −NH2+ moiety of nfx± is involved in hydrogen-bonding interaction with Glu35 of lyz. On
the other hand, the intermolecular energy of docked nfx– in lysozyme was found to be −5.64 kcal mol–1, of which electrostatic interaction energy is −2.07 kcal
mol–1 and van der Waals, hydrogen-bonding interaction
energy is −3.57 kcal mol–1. Although these
values are somewhat approximations, combining the tryptophan quenching
and the fluorimetric thermodynamics studies, it could be inferred
that it is the dominance of strong hydrogen-bonding interaction that
makes the nfx±–lyz association more potent
over the nfx±–lyz case.

3 Summary and Conclusions
Considering
all of the experimental results, here we discuss the
key findings.

The previous studies on norfloxacin–protein
binding focused
on only one form of norfloxacin (zwitterionic species at pH ∼7.4).
Here, we framed our work in a wide pH range to extract information
on the interaction of all the three protomeric species of norfloxacin
prevailing at different pH. For a denotative picture of the nfx–lyz
interaction, fluorescence spectral characteristics of both the protein
and the drug at different pH were examined along with the other spectroscopic
measurements. The emission spectral features of the drug provide information
on the fate of the drug inside the protein pocket. Modulation of spectral
properties of the drug at any of its protomeric forms upon lyz addition
should not be utilized to decipher specific binding affinity of the
individual forms, as there might be shifting in any of the prototropic
equilibria in the presence of the host protein. Whereas modulation
in the fluorescence emission of the protein helps in determining the
absolute binding affinity of the protein toward the individual species
of the drug. The initial study, by monitoring the emission spectra
of nfx at three different pH, suggested that the cationic from nfx+ does not show substantial interaction with lyz (at pH 4.2),
whereas the other two protomeric species show interaction with the
protein. This is most probably because the side chain amino groups
remain protonated and provide lyz a high net positive charge at the
acidic pH (4.2), and hence the cationic drug molecule is not allowed
by the protein to approach and get hosted into it. Because of spectral
similarity between the zwitterionic and the anionic form, no conclusive
result was obtained on the binding of nfx± or nfx– with lyz by simply monitoring the emission spectra
of the two concerned species. Then, to resolve the said issues and
to get a clear quantitative idea on the interaction process of these
two protomers with lyz, fluorescence quenching of the protein was
further monitored. Therein, it was uncovered that lysozyme binds the
zwitterionic form of norfloxacin with a much higher binding constant
value compared to the anionic form which has a weak association. The
competitive binding assay performed with ANS revealed that norfloxacin
(nfx± and nfx–) binds the same binding
region to that of ANS in the lyz matrix which is rather a hydrophobic
region. Then, the binding site of nfx was further identified by molecular
docking simulation that pointed a region in the catalytic active site
of lyz. The analysis of the thermodynamic parameters from the temperature
variation method as well as the molecular docking analysis of the
association process of the most strongly binding nfx± to lyz shows major dominance of the van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding
interactions. At this point, the observed little fluorescence quenching
of nfx± by lyz is rationalized due to the operation
of strong hydrogen bonding. Again, considering the much higher affinity
of nfx± for lyz than that of the nfx–, it could be well justified to propose here that the observed emission
feature of nfx– which became exactly similar to
that of nfx± with increasing lyz concentration should
be due to a switchover of the anionic form to its zwitterionic form.
The pH inside the body system depends on the local environment, and
it ranges from the acidic to alkaline in different body fluids, and
it also varies in cases of normal and inflamed tissues. In alkaline
pH, where norfloxacin is mostly present in its anionic form, encountering
with lysozyme will eventually increase the population of the zwitterionic
form. For the antimicrobial drugs such as fluoroquinolones, the target
is the enzyme-DNA topoisomerase inside the bacterial cell. Therefore,
prior to reaching the target, a fundamental requirement is to cross
the bacterial cell membrane by these antimicrobial drugs. As mentioned
previously, the fluoroquinolone drugs in their zwitterionic form can
cross lipid bilayer membranes by passive diffusion in an antiparallely
stacked arrangement so that their polarity and the electrostatic potential
barrier of membrane penetration are minimized. Living bacteria have
a pH gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane; where the cytoplasm
pH is a bit acidic (e.g., Escherichia coli cytoplasmic pH ∼6.1) than external pH. The zwitterionic fluoroquinolone
drug molecules enter through the membranes, and then they are converted
into positively charged species (as intracellular pH is acidic), resulting
in the effective entrapment of the drug molecules that reach a therapeutic
level of drug accumulation inside bacterial cells. Hence, this lysozyme-induced
switchover of anionic nfx– to zwitterionic nfx± is advantageous with respect to their membrane permeability.

Therefore, we find from the study that depending on the protonation
state of a drug, which in turn depends on the local pH of the immediate
environment, the drug may interact with differential affinity with
relevant biomolecules present around. Additionally, such drugs having
single or multistep acid–base equilibrium may get interconverted
into any of their protomers that are preferred by the host biomolecule
and consequently leads to an alteration in the prototropic equilibrium
and hence drug pharmacokinetics also. We found from the current study
that in dealing with comparative binding affinities of lysozyme with
a drug (norfloxacin) having multiple protomeric forms, pH-dependent
specific interaction of a particular form with specific charge and
structural features dominate the binding process with the host protein.
In a recent study, we found that lysozyme prefers the phenolate pyranine
over its protonated acid form working at pH ∼7.41 Some other studies with drugs having single
acid–base equilibrium with their cationic and neutral protomers
reported about the preference of lysozyme (chicken variety) toward
the neutral protomers. Also, there are reports showing that binding
of a ligand (having only one form) with lysozyme is most effective
at pH of around ∼7.4 (i.e., at physiological pH).42,43 Here, we find that lysozyme selectively prefers the zwitterionic
norfloxacin over the cationic or anionic species. Therefore, this
study suggests that depending on the ionic nature and structural features
of the guest molecule, the host lysozyme decides its specificity for
any particular protomer of the guest, which in turn depends on the
specific interaction forces involved in the binding process. The environmental
pH should also be another governing factor in this regard, as pH-dependant
structural changes of the protein as well as the alteration of ionization
states of involved amino acid side chains should have salient roles.
Such findings, in turn, elevate the detailed consideration on the
interaction of individual acid–base pair of any prototropic
drug existing at different pH and interacting with some specific biomolecular
targets of interest.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Human lysozyme (>90%, recombinant,
expressed in rice) and norfloxacin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., India, respectively. 8-Anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate
magnesium salt (ANS) was purchased from TCI chemicals, Japan. Other
chemicals were of analytical grade. Phosphate buffer solutions of
pH 4.2, 7.2, and 9.2 prepared for experiments, were of 5 mM strength.
Ultrapure water was used for all solution preparations. pHs of buffer
solutions were measured with a EUTECH pH 510 ion pH-meter.

4.2 Instrumentation and Methods
UV–vis
absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 absorption
spectrophotometer against a solvent blank reference in the wavelength
range of 250–350 nm.

All steady-state fluorescence emission
and steady-state emission anisotropy measurements were taken on a
Jobin Yvon Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer, using a 1 cm path-length
quartz cuvette. Norfloxacin concentration, for fluorescence emission
measurements, was kept at 1.5 × 10–6 M. Norfloxacin
was photoexcited at 331 nm; emission spectra were collected from 350
to 600 nm, keeping the excitation slit at 2.5 nm and emission slit
at 2 nm. The lysozyme concentration used for its emission studies
was 1 × 10–6 M, and its emission was monitored
by exciting selectively its intrinsic tryptophan fluorophore at 295
nm, keeping the excitation slit at 5 nm and emission slit at 3 nm.
A 2 × 10–6 M aqueous ANS solution was used
for its emission spectral measurements, where the samples were excited
at 380 nm, with excitation and emission slits at 6 and 5 nm, respectively.
The experimentally measured fluorescence intensity was corrected according
to the expression,28Fcor = (Fobs – Fb) × 10(Aex+Aem)/2, for any background fluorescence
and inner filter effects. Here, Fcor is
the corrected fluorescence intensity, Fobs is the experimentally measured fluorescence intensity, Fb is any significant background fluorescence intensity,
and Aex and Aem are the absorbances of the sample at the excitation and emission
wavelengths, respectively. The fluorescence spectra are all plotted
with the corrected intensities (Fcor).
The vertical bars with caps, used on the data points wherever present,
represent the error bars.

Time-resolved fluorescence intensity
decays were collected by using
a time-correlated single-photon counting picosecond spectrophotometer
(LifeSpec II; Edinburgh Instruments, U.K.). Samples were excited by
a picosecond pulsed light-emitting diode (EPLED-290) centered at 296
nm, and emission signals were collected at the magic angle (54.7°),
using a photomultiplier tube (H10720-01 photosensor module from Hamamatsu
Photonics). The instrument response function was ∼800 ps. The
decay analyses were performed by using F-900 software from Edinburgh
Instruments.41

4.3 Molecular
Docking
The crystal structure
of human lysozyme (protein data bank (PDB) ID: 1IX0)44 was taken from the protein data bank for the docking study.
Polar hydrogens were added, and water molecules were removed from
the PDB file to prepare software specific files. Both the molecular
structure of nfx± and nfx– were
optimized by PM3 prescription using Gaussian 09 program package.45 These optimized structures of both nfx± and nfx– were docked into the 3D crystal structure
of lyz using AutoDock 4.2-based blind-docking.9 It employs the Lamarckian genetic algorithm for searching the optimum
binding site of small molecules in protein.46 AutoDock reports docked energy that includes a solvation-free energy
term and intermolecular interaction energy of the ligand. To perform
the blind-docking analysis, the grid center was set at 60, 60, and
60 along X, Y, and Z axes, respectively, with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å. The lowest
energy conformation, out of 30 conformations, was taken as the most
preferred binding position of both the nfx± and nfx– in lysozyme.

4.4 Circular Dichroism Spectra
Circular
dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco-810 automatic recording
spectropolarimeter in the wavelength range of 200–250 nm, with
a scan speed 50 nm min–1, under constant nitrogen
flushing, at 298 K. Two successive scans were accumulated for each
spectrum with a quartz cell of path length 0.1 cm. Baselines were
corrected with buffer solutions. A 20 μM lyz solution was used
for measurements.
