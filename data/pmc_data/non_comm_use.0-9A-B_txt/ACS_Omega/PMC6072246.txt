Nafion formed on the surface of a
boron-doped diamond electrode
allows for a chemosensing system for biotin. The modified electrode
is capable of oxidizing biotin and offers a detection limit of 5 nM,
the average normal level of biotin in blood plasma. The developed
method was successfully applied to determine biotin in human plasma
samples and a popular health product as two popular models.

Introduction
For the most part,
the use of biotin (also known as coenzyme R,
vitamin H or B7) is limited to labeling studies of biomolecules for
diversified applications.1 As a stable
and small molecule (MW of 244.3 Da), biotin rarely alters the function
of resulting conjugated molecules. Biotin acts as a catalyst for carboxylase
enzymes.2 The adequate intake of biotin
for adults is 30–100 μg/day based on as estimated from
Food and Nutrition Board3 for health benefits
such as stimulating hair growth and treating certain medical conditions
including biotin deficiency (BTD), lipid disorders, diabetes, and
diabetic peripheral neuropathy.4−7 However, supraphysiological consumption of biotin
in a plethora of health products results in its high concentration
in blood. Free biotin in patient samples is posing a serious threat
to immunodiagnostics, as evident by the recent safety alert by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).8 Free biotin can interfere with the diagnostic results of assays
employing biotin–avidin interactions, by competing with the
biotinylated recognition element, thereby leading to false positives
or false negatives.9 Thus, a rapid and
inexpensive method for the determination of biotin in patient samples
is urgently needed. The level of biotin might be used to correct for
its interference in immunoassays using the avidin–biotin chemistry.
The current popular method is based on 4-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic
acid which forms a reversible yellow-orange color complex with avidin.10 This avidin-binding dye is stoichiometrically
displaced by biotin, leading to the subsequent absorption change,
which provides a basis for the assay.

There are only a few studies
pertaining to direct electroanalysis
of biotin. Pioneering work, dating back over 40 years, unravels an
irreversible one-electron reduction of biotin at −1.8 V, in
dimethylformamide (DMF)–water solutions.11,12 The topic was revisited by Lauw et al. to investigate biotin reduction
at a platinum (Pt) surface, in DMF and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) supported
by the organic salt tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF).13 Therein, biotin at 2 mM is reduced by one-electron
to form a carboxylate anion and dihydrogen in DMF and DMSO.13 This behavior is more pronounced in DMF than
DMSO with a Pt electrode poised at −1.6 V versus Fc/Fc+ (Fc = Ferrocene) but does not occur if glassy carbon is used
as the electrode material.13 This approach
is not applicable for the assay of biotin in aqueous samples because
of the severe interference of water, even in minute quantity, particularly
at high positive or negative potentials, as discussed later.

In general, biotin in foodstuffs and biological fluids can be analyzed
by bioassays, avidin–streptavidin-binding assays, or fluorescent
derivative assays.14 However, biotin metabolites
and analogs interfere with the assay, particularly for the avidin
assay as addressed later. For a specific analysis of biotin in the
presence of its metabolites, the sample must be subjected to high-performance
liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy (HPLC–MS) followed
by avidin–streptavidin-binding assays.15 The former procedure is capable of separating biotin from its metabolites
whereas the latter detects biotin as well as its metabolites.

The boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode has been advocated here
because of its low background current, resistance to fouling, and
broad potential window.16 Recent reports
have demonstrated its applicability for detection of Pseudomonas quinolone signal, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline,
pyocyanin,17−19 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-thiazole-4-carbaldehyde (IQS),20 and barakacin21 as
a molecular signature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There are a number of analytical techniques reported for biotin
determination such as spectrometry,22 polarography,12 thin-layer chromatography,23 capillary electrophoresis,24 and high-performance liquid chromatography.25−27

This
communication unravels a new strategy for specific analysis
of biotin based on its electrochemical oxidation of biotin at the
surface of a Nafion-modified BDD electrode in an aqueous media. Two
popular model systems: a natural product and human blood plasma will
be tested to validate the proof of concept. In our opinion, there
is no report which exploits such features for the electroanalysis
of biotin.

Results and Discussion
Behavior of the Bare BDD Electrode
Considering the
limited aqueous solubility of biotin (0.2 mg/mL),28 the experiment was first conducted using a bare BDD electrode
in acetonitrile (MeCN) supported by TBAPF. This organic salt is highly
soluble in MeCN and offers a very low current background over a wide
potential range. Furthermore, the high miscibility of MeCN with water
(40:60%, v/v) accommodates the analysis of aqueous samples. In summary,
both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometry i–t curve confirmed the oxidation of biotin (also prepared
in MeCN–TBAPF) at the applied potential of +1.8 V with a detection
limit (LOD) of 3 μM (Figure S1a,b). In contrast, there was significant interference using aqueous
biotin samples because of peaks derived from oxygen evolution and
solvent breakdown29 (Figure S1c). When the MeCN–TBAPF system was applied
to an aqueous biotin sample, the above LOD was no longer attained.
Even at water: electrolyte volume ratios below 1:50, the adsorbed
water onto the electrode (BDD–H2O) was oxidized
at high potentials (2H+ + 2e– + 1/2O2), as reflected by a current that increased steadily at potentials
beyond +1.8 V. This phenomenon of oxygen evolution via water hydrolysis
is well-known30 and limits the applied
potential of most metallic electrodes to below 0.8–0.9 V.

In MeCN, the released protons can exit into the reaction/diffusion
layer near the electrode surface and can be accommodated by MeCN as
a proton acceptor. Solvent (MeCN and TBAPF) breakdown could also occur
here, resulting in further interference peaks. Indeed, the solvent
breakdown has been known at the Pt surface in a MeCN/tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate system,29 whereas BF4– acts as a fluorinating
agent in MeCN at +2.0 V together with the formation of HF.31

In this work, an attempt using a high
negative potential for the
reduction of biotin was also not successful in the presence of a small
amount of water from the biotin sample at the BDD electrode in MeCN–TBAPF.
The CV exhibited a very high and broad emerging peak at −1.8
V and a small peak at −2 V, which overlapped with the biotin
reduction peak (Figure S2). These two peaks
could be attributed to the reduction of water adsorbed on BDD (H2O + e– → 1/2H2 (gas) +
OH–). The formed OH– has been
known to react with MeCN to form acetamide (CH3CO–NH2), resulting in the solvent breakdown as reported by Pons
and Khoo32 which again could lead to interfering
peaks. Evidence pointing to acetamide formation was provided by the
presence of an IR peak at 1650 cm–1 on an electrolyte
sample taken after 30 cycles of voltammetry (−2.5 to +2.5 V
at 100 mV s–1), (Figure S3). The OH– could also be formed from the reduction
of dissolved oxygen, involving two different pathways. Oxygen is reduced
directly to OH– by a four-electron transfer, via
H–O2 as an intermediate species, followed by two
further electron-transfer processes to yield 4 × OH–.33 Alternatively, the hydride ion (H–) in the solution is known to deprotonate MeCN to CH2–CN, which then attacks another MeCN to form a dimer.29 Besides the restriction of water, the MeCN–TBAF
approach lacks the detection sensitivity required for blood screening
for biotin, ranging from 35 nM to 2.02 μM after single doses
of 1 mg or 100 mg.9

Performance of the Nafion
Modified BDD Electrode
The
experiments were then performed in aqueous electrolytes using 0.2
M phosphate buffers at pH 4 and pH 2. The Nafion was drop-casted on
the BDD electrode. A representative CV of the Nafion-modified electrode
with and without biotin is shown in Figure 1a,b, which shows the emerging oxidation peak
of the biotin oxidation product(s). It is important to mention that
the band around +1.5 V is due to the phosphate buffer in Figure 1b, whereas the acetate
buffer does not induce any band (Figure 1a). The polymeric structure of Nafion contains
a hydrophobic (CF2–CF2) backbone, along
with two oxygen atoms and a hydrophilic sulfonic acid (SO3–) group, which contributes to its electron-withdrawing
effect. Thus, Nafion displays both hydrophobic and ionic interactions
with the BDD surface to form a stable layer, as confirmed by CV and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Figure 1c,d). The parameters
obtained for the bare and Nafion-modified BDD electrodes using an
equivalent circuit Rs (Cdl(RctZw)) is shown in Table S1. The Nafion-modified
BDD electrode is reusable and required to be cleaned only in 0.5 M
H2SO4. The electrode was tested using the ferri/ferrocyanide
redox couple as described in Figure 1c,d. The BDD itself is prepared by chemical vapor deposition
with hydrogen gas and thus is recognized to be hydrogen-terminated.16

A simple i–t curve poised
at +1.8 V shown in Figure 2a illustrated an LOD of <1 μM for biotin for the
Nafion-modified BDD electrode at pH 4. Remarkably, an estimated LOD
of 5 nM of biotin was obtained at pH 2, when the Nafion-modified electrode
was poised at +1.8 V (Figure 2b) because of the lower and stable background current. Figure 2c shows the performance
of the Nafion-modified BDD electrode at high concentrations of biotin,
and the calibration curve of biotin exhibited excellent linearity
(R2 > 0.99) (Figure 2c insert).

BDD electrode vs Ag/AgCl, the potential was at +1.8 V, using 0.2 M

A premixed biotin–avidin or biotin–streptavidin
sample
provoked no signal response (Figure 3a,b). Conversely, the response signal of biotin decreased
significantly when the protein (avidin or streptavidin) was introduced
to the electrochemical cell, illustrating the formation of the biotin–protein
complex. It is well-known that avidin and streptavidin possesses a
hydrophobic cavity that binds four biotin molecules irreversibly.34 There are many interesting works on the oxidation
and reduction of biotin. The oxidation product of biotin by electrochemical
oxidation is not known and requires further investigation. The sulfur
of biotin can be oxidized by H2O2, oxone, and
other strong oxidants to form biotin sulfoxide35 and biotin sulfone.36 However,
experimentally, such reactions must be performed for several hours,
usually at elevated temperature. Using a strong reductant (Raney nickel)
was reported to reduce biotin to desthiobiotin.37 In a contrasting report, biotin is not activated by Raney
nickel and the tetrahydrofuran moiety of oxybiotin appears quite robust.38 Bacterial degradation of biotin using a β
oxidative system39 drives oxidation of
the valeric side chain, before hydrolysis of the ureido ring to form
bisnorbiotin and teranorbiotin. Oxybiotin, an analog of biotin (O
instead of S), can be prepared from biotin by oxidation.40 In electrochemical reduction, biotin is simply
reduced by one-electron to carboxylate anion and dihydrogen via a
discharge of the carboxylic acid at the Pt surface.13 In this context, it is difficult to specify the oxidation
product(s) produced by the modified electrode protocol described herein.
As mentioned earlier, Nafion consists of a hydrophobic backbone and
a hydrophilic sulfonic acid group. When the water content of the membrane
is increased, the proton simultaneously diffuses through a polymer
electrolyte membrane, and the Nafion membrane is dehydrated due to
the electroosmotic drag from hydronium ion.41 Also, the rate of proton transport depends on the water concentration.42 Thus, the initial step of electrochemical oxidation
using the Nafion-modified BDD electrode involves the partial protonation
of biotin at the sulfur of the tetrahydrothiophene ring and possibly
the C=O of the ureido group. Then, electrochemical oxidation
of protonated biotin results3 in a distinct
possibility that the oxidation products involves sulfoxide or sulfone
groups,43,44 or even oxybiotin40 as shown in Scheme 1. It should be noted that the oxidation capability of the BDD system
also leads to the possibility of accessing biotin analogs with different
biological activities using electrochemical means and without recourse
to atom-uneconomic oxidizing agents.

following the sequential addition of avidin and biotin. (b) i–t curve obtained following the

Analytical Performance of the Chemosensor
The chemosensing
approach was then applied to the analysis of a commercial health product
with a high dose of biotin (900 μg) together with other components.
A simple measurement by the i–t curve was sufficient to estimate biotin content, based on the signal
response invoked (Figure 4). A single biotin tablet (900 μg) was dissolved in
deionized water. The quantity of biotin was estimated to be between
874 and 884 μg, compared with 900 μg as specified by the
manufacturer.

1 μM
biotin tablet and 1 μM of the biotin standard. The detection
was achieved on the Nafion-modified BDD electrode: +1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl,
using 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 2.

Immunoassays for biotin have been commercially available
using
a microtiter plate coated with avidin or streptavidin. In brief, the
enzyme-labeled biotin and the biotin-containing sample are added,
which compete with each other for the avidin binding sites. After
the removal of unbound enzyme-labeled biotin, a specific enzyme substrate
is added to trigger color change with a resulting absorbance change
proportional to the biotin concentration of the sample. However, the
assay is not specific for biotin because some known biotin analogs
also bind to the coating avidin–streptavidin.

The cross-reactivity
is about 83% for biocytin 34.7% for biotin-d-sulfoxide,
28.2% for biotin sulfone, 24.5% for biotin-l-sulfoxide,
and 5.5% compared with 100% for biotin.45 This method is referred as the total avidin
binding assay, that is, biotin together with its analogs. Nevertheless,
the assay should be applicable for the analysis of biotin in food
samples considering the absence of such biotin analogs. However, the
biotin analogs are not negligible but account for half of the total
avidin-binding substances in human plasma.46 This critical issue has pointed out who require hemodialysis from
the analysis of patients’ blood for biotins.47 Of notice is the specific detection of biotin by the Nafion-modified
BDD electrode because the above biotin analogs are not oxidized at
this applied potential for the oxidation of biotin. Apparently, the
difference between the results obtained by the electrode and the immunoassay
reflects the level of the biotin analogs. This finding leads to a
significance application considering the simplicity of rapidity of
electrochemical analysis over HPLC for separation of biotin from its
metabolites.

The detection of biotin from blood and blood plasma
serves as an
indicator of BTD and in some cases it is important for the patients
who are subjected to hemodialysis or under biotin therapy with high
dosage. Therefore, the modified electrode was then applied to the
plasma sample, a more challenging task because of the presence of
endogenous electroactive compounds. Indeed, numerous human blood components
have been identified in this very complex matrix.48 The commercial plasma sample exhibited several major differential
pulse voltammetry (DPV) peaks, illustrating the presence of endogenous
electroactive molecules including uric acid, dopamine, and so forth.
(Figure 5). Indeed,
numerous human blood components have been identified in this very
complex matrix.48 The two peaks obtained
from plasma samples were identified as dopamine and tryptophan (Figure 5B,C). Thus, the analysis
of biotin in blood plasma samples could not be realized by the simple i–t approach (Figure S4). The plasma samples spiked with uric acid results
in an increased baseline signal (Figure S5), whereas the plasma samples spiked with tyrosine resulted in a
decreased signal (Figure S6). Nevertheless,
DPV enabled the detection of spiked biotin in blood plasma samples
in the presence of the matrix interferences. However, colorimetric
assays including Elisa using the avidin–biotin chemistry will
detect biotin and biotin analogs, whereas our approach only detects
biotin. Therefore, the results of the two procedures are not comparable,
considering that the total metabolite concentration is about 50% that
of biotin. Of course, LC–MS, an expensive lab-based laboratory,
will be used to compare the results obtained by the electrochemical
sensor. This task is underway in our laboratories to monitor the biotin
levels in patients’ blood, a separate topic in our future endeavor.

using 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 2.

The detection selectivity and sensitivity of the Nafion-modified
BDD electrode deserves a brief comment here with respect to the detection
limit required in clinical chemistry. Biotin plays an important role
in the human organs, which might serve as a BTD index. The clinical
analysis of biotin will involve over 50–60 patients from three
different groups: male, female, and young people because their respective
biotin levels are noticeably different and the blood level after the
digestion of biotin varies significantly. Of particular interest is
the beneficial effects of high-dose biotin therapy in progressive
multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common disabling neurological disease
in young adults. Under biotin therapy, the biotin concentration of
an MS patient can reach 2.84 μM.49 A liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method (LCMS–MS)
has been proven useful with a measuring range of 20 nM to 12.3 μM.
The electroanalysis with a detection limit of micrometer could be
useful to follow the biotin level of MS patients under biotin therapy
with high dosage. The sample can be preconcentrated by solid-phase
extraction, a simple and fast step in analytical and clinical chemistry.

Conclusions
Nafion formed a stable layer on the surface
of a BDD electrode
and allowed for sensitive detection of biotin. In the absence of Nafion,
the nonaqueous approach using MeCN and a conducting salt gave a poor
detection limit. The BDD electrode displayed a wide, usable potential
window at pH 2 and was capable of oxidizing biotin, resulting in a
detection limit of 5 nM. This inexpensive and rapid method is of interest
for the analysis of biotin in various clinical, biological, and food
samples. As described previously, the high level of biotin interferes
with immunoassays based on the biotinylated molecules, resulting in
falsely increased or decreased test results. This is a serious pending
issue in the clinical diagnosis of biomarkers and diversified important
analytes. Together with solid-phase extraction, this approach can
deliver the detection sensitivity as required in clinical chemistry.

Then, the plasma was spiked with 100 μM biotin standard and
incubated for 15 min. A blank plasma sample (100 μL) was added
to the electrochemical cell containing 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH
2, whereas the three different volumes of the biotin-spiked plasma
sample (100, 200, and 300 μL) was added to the electrochemixzcal
cell containing 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 2. To identify the electroactive

EIS measurement was performed
at room temperature using a CHI660C electrochemical workstation (CH
Instrument, Austin, TX). DPV, amperometric measurement i–t curve, and CV were used during electrochemical
measurements at ambient temperature using a CHI1040A electrochemical
workstation (CH Instrument, Austin, TX). The electrochemical cell
consists of the BDD working electrode (Windsor Scientific, Slough
Berkshire, UK), a Pt wire counter electrode (Sigma-Aldrich, Dublin,
Ireland), and a silver chloride (Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl) reference electrode
(BASi Analytical Instruments, West Layette, IN). The CV and ESI measurements
were performed in 10 mM K3Fe(CN)64–/3– supported by 0.1 M KCl. EIS was performed with AC frequency ranged
between 1 Hz and 100 kHz at +0.2 V.

The BDD electrode
was polished using 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina slurry with wet Nylon
and MasterTex papers, respectively, followed by sonication in MeCN
for 5 min and deionized water for 10 min. The Nafion-modified BDD
electrode was obtained by drop-casting 2 μL of Nafion solution
(2 w/v %, prepared in ethanol) on the polished BDD electrode followed
by vacuum drying.
