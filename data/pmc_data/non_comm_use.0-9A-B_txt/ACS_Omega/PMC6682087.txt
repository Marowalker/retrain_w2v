Enzymatic modification, using a protease
from Bacillus
licheniformis (Subtilisin A), was carried out on polyamide
6.6 (PA6.6) fabric to make it more amenable to water-based nanocoatings
used to impart electrical conductivity. The modified PA6.6 fibers
exhibit a smoother surface, increased hydrophilicity due to more carboxyl
and amino groups, and larger ζ-potential relative to unmodified
polyamide. With its improved hydrophilicity and surface functionality,
the modified textile is better able to accept a water-based nanocoating,
composed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) stabilized by sodium
deoxycholate (DOC) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA),
deposited via layer-by-layer assembly. Relative to unmodified fabric,
the enzymatically modified fibers exhibit lower sheet resistance as
a function of PDDA/MWCNT-DOC bilayers deposited. This relatively green
technique could be used to impart a variety of useful functionalities
to otherwise difficult-to-treat synthetic fibers like polyamide.

Introduction
Polyamide 6.6 represents one of the most
widely used synthetic
materials due to its low cost, lightweight, high strength, and very
good abrasion, chemical, and creep resistance.1,2 These
properties allow polyamide to be used in numerous applications, such
as seat belts, carpet, upholstery, and clothing,1,3 where
impact resistance and strength are required. Like most polymers, PA6.6
is electrically insulating and frequently results in accumulation
of potentially harmful static charge.4 Electrically
conductive textiles can be used as electromagnetic interference shielding,
antistatic flooring and ceiling materials, radar cross-section reducing
protective fabrics for stealth technology, and wearable electrodes
for continuous health monitoring.5−7

Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) are among the most frequently exploited
nanoparticles for imparting electrical conductivity. Several techniques
are known for preparing CNT thin films, such as spray coating, dip
coating, spin coating, vacuum filtration, electrophoretic deposition,
sputter deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and layer-by-layer
(LbL) assembly.8−13 LbL assembly is a highly tailorable nanocoating technique, involving
alternate exposure of a substrate to oppositely charged polyelectrolyte
solutions or suspensions, giving rise to a multilayer thin film.14 This simple, inexpensive, and environmentally
benign technique, which is carried out at atmospheric pressure and
room temperature, uses dilute aqueous solutions. The variety of the
different ingredients that can be used for this technique, such as
polyelectrolytes, inorganic particles, organic nanomaterials, and
renewable macromolecules, makes it possible to create nanocoatings
with impressive functionality.15,16 LbL assembly has been
used to impart a variety of properties, including antimicrobial17,18 and antifouling,19 flame retardant,20 anticorrosion,21 gas
barrier,22 drug delivery,23 and electrical conductivity,9−13,24−27 on various substrates. Several studies of LbL modification of polyamide
fibers have been conducted to impart flame retardancy28−32 and sensor activity33 and to improve
the durability of a polyamide reverse osmosis membrane.34

Although LbL assembly is a very simple
and promising technique,
effective deposition on nylon fibers remains a challenge. The major
problem is poor interfacial adhesion between the substrate and the
polyelectrolyte solutions/suspensions, which depends on the charge
of the polyelectrolytes, pH and ionic strength of the solution, as
well as the hydrophilicity and surface charge of the substrate.15 Polyamide fibers are relatively hydrophobic
because they have insufficient functional groups on their surfaces.35−38 Several processes have been reported to functionalize nylon by chemical
and physical methods.3,39 Harsh chemical methods include
alkaline or acid hydrolysis, can have a negative environmental impact,
and cause damage to the fabric structure.40 UV radiation and plasma activation are “clean” methods,41,42 but functionalization is uneven and often accompanied by surface
damage. Moreover, these techniques require complex machinery that
is very expensive. Enzymatic modification of the polyamide surface
is another chemical (biochemical) treatment performed under mild,
environmentally benign conditions.39 Enzyme
treatment saves water, energy, and chemicals, and uses processing
equipment currently available in the textile industry.43 Proteases,35−38 amidases,44 and cutinases39,45,46 have been successfully used to hydrolyze polyamide fibers.

In the present study, a previously reported enzymatic modification
was employed to improve the hydrophilicity (wettability) of PA6.6
fabric.38 By introducing additional surface
carboxyl and amino groups, polyamide fibers achieved conductivity
with fewer deposited bilayers (BLs) than unmodified polyamide. Although
enzymatic modification of PA6.6 is well known, it has never been combined
with layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition to impart functionality to textiles.
Enzymatically modified PA6.6 exhibits increased wettability and higher
ζ-potential relative to unmodified fabric. Layer-by-layer deposition
of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)- and sodium deoxycholate
(DOC)-stabilized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) results in electrically
conductive fibers. The enzymatically modified fabric exhibits a more
uniform nanocoating and higher conductivity with fewer layers deposited,
relative to the unmodified fabric. This type of natural modification
of synthetic fibers could be used as a means to more effectively deposit
water-based treatments for greater functionality.

Results and Discussion
Enzymatic
Modification of Fabric
Enzymatic modification
of the PA6.6 fabric was carried out using protease that acts under
mild working conditions: 60 °C, pH 6.8, and a 60 min treatment
time.38,45,46 During this
treatment, the hydrophobic surface of PA6.6 should be hydrolyzed through
hydrolytic cleaving of the peptide bonds, producing carboxyl and amino
groups, as shown in Figure 1. Successful enzymatic modification is imperative for producing
conductive polyamide fabric with fewer nanotube-based bilayers deposited.
The effectiveness of this process is confirmed through changes in
polyamide surface morphology, fabric wettability, and surface charge.

Figure 1 Enzymatic
hydrolysis of PA6.6 by protease enzyme.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PA6.6 fibers
before
and after enzymatic modification are shown in Figure 2. Unmodified fibers show some residual polymer,
as well as impurities, probably remaining from the extrusion process
(Figure 2a). After
enzymatic modification, residual polymer and impurities are removed,
making the surface of the fibers smoother, without any irregularities.
The smooth and clean surface of these modified PA6.6 fibers is one
confirmation that the enzymatic treatment is effective.

Figure 2 SEM images
of (a) unmodified and (b) enzymatically modified PA6.6
fibers.

The hydrophilicity of the enzymatically
modified PA6.6 fabric was
evaluated by determining the time it takes for a drop of Triton X-100
nonionic surfactant solution to be completely absorbed into the fabric,
as well as by analyzing the shape of the water drop 3 min after the
drop touches the surface of the fabric. The results in Figure 3 indicate that the unmodified
fabric needs an average time of 3358 s to completely absorb the drops,
while the modified PA6.6 fabric exhibits improved wettability and
thus lower drop absorption time. During the observation of the drops
wetting the unmodified PA6.6 fabric, it appeared that the drops actually
evaporated rather than being absorbed into the fabric.

by the drop absorption time using 1
cm3/dm3 Triton X-100 solution. Images of the
water drop 3 min after being deposited on (b) unmodified PA6.6 fabric
and (c) enzymatically modified PA6.6 fabric.

The influence of the enzyme concentration on the wettability
of
the enzymatically modified PA6.6 is also illustrated in Figure 3. With increasing enzyme concentration,
fabric wettability increases. Modified PA6.6 fabric with 5% overweight
of the fabric (owf) enzyme exhibits an 8.7-fold increase in wettability,
while those modified with 10 and 20% (owf) display 10.1- and 11.7-fold
wettability increases, respectively, compared to the unmodified fabric.
Although the 20% (owf) enzyme-treated textile achieves the highest
wettability, the 10% (owf) concentration is used for further investigation,
due to high cost and diminishing benefit from higher concentration.
The treatment with the enzyme concentration of 5% (owf) imparts similar
wettability to the fabric compared to that of 10% (owf), but the standard
deviation of the average value is much higher. The images of the water
drop taken 3 min after touching the surface of the fabric reveal higher
water-absorbing ability of the modified PA6.6 fabric, compared to
the unmodified one, as shown in Figure 3b,c. These tests further confirm the successful modification
of PA6.6 due to the greater hydrophilicity shown here from the presence
of amino and carboxyl groups.

The scheme of enzymatic modification
(Figure 1) indicates
that the enzymes hydrolyze molecules
of PA6.6, producing carboxyl and amino groups. Dyeing the fabric is
a good method for determining the presence of these functional groups.38,47 Methylene blue is a positively charged basic dye for determining
the presence of carboxyl groups, while acid orange 7 is a negatively
charged acid dye for assessing the presence of amino groups. The intensity
of the dyeing is a good indicator of the amount of functionality existing
on the surface.38,45,50,51 The images and the K/S values of unmodified and modified PA6.6 fabric, dyed with
methylene blue and acid orange 7 (Table 1), clearly show differences between unmodified
and modified samples. The modified fabric exhibits more intense color
and higher K/S values after dyeing
with both dyes. The same trend of higher K/S values of enzyme-modified relative to unmodified polyamide
was reported previously when protease, acylase, and cutinase were
used for successful modification of polyamide fibers.36,38,45 These results indicate that,
upon enzymatic modification, new carboxyl and amino groups were introduced.

Table 1 Amount of Carboxyl and Amino Groups
on PA6.6 Fabric Determined by Dyeing
ζ-Potential and isoelectric point (IEP) are
also good indicators
of functionality existing on the surface of PA6.6, as shown in Figure 4. These results reveal
that, upon enzymatic treatment, new carboxyl and amino groups are
introduced. Enzymatically modified fabric has almost twice the positive
and 2.5× the negative surface charge relative to the unmodified
fabric. This increase of the positive ζ-potential and the decrease
of the negative ζ-potential are due to the introduction of carboxyl
and amino groups during the enzymatic treatment. Indeed, this confirms
the presence of the carboxyl, responsible for the negative charge,
and the amino, responsible for the positive charge of the fabric surface,
on PA6.6 fabric. The curve patterns of ζ-potential as a function
of pH of the unmodified and enzymatically modified polyamide are similar
to those of nylon modified by the acylase enzyme.36 The isoelectric points of the unmodified and enzymatically
modified fabric are at pH 3.45 and 3.6, respectively. Enzymatically
modified PA6.6 has a greater IEP as a result of more positive amino
groups created during the enzymatic hydrolysis.

Deposition of Conductive
Nanocoating on Fabric
A multilayer
nanocoating composed of PDDA and MWNT-DOC9−11 was used to
impart electrical conductivity to PA6.6 fabric. The layer-by-layer
deposition of the coating is shown schematically in Figure 5a. Figure 5b shows sheet resistance of the fabric. The
unmodified and modified samples have almost the same sheet resistance
values after being coated with two and three PDDA/MWCNT-DOC bilayers.
With 4 BL deposited, the unmodified PA6.6 fabric has almost the same
value of sheet resistance as those coated with two and three bilayers,
while the enzymatically modified fabric exhibits a substantially decreased
sheet resistance (i.e., higher conductivity). After coating with 5
to 7 BL, the sheet resistance of both fabrics continues to decrease,
but the enzymatically modified PA6.6 exhibits progressively lower
sheet resistance than the unmodified sample. These results suggest
that the percolation threshold of the enzymatically modified system
is at or above 4 BL, while that of the unmodified fabric is at or
above 5 BL.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic procedure for deposition of a conductive coating
on unmodified and enzymatically modified PA6.6 fabric using the PDDA/MWCNT-DOC
multilayer system. (b) Sheet resistance as a function of the number
of PDDA/MWCNT-DOC bilayers deposited.

The percolation threshold is a characteristic for inhomogeneous
conductors, such as polymer composites containing electrically conductive
filler (e.g., carbon nanotubes). The conductive composites begin to
transition from insulator to conductor as more conductive filler is
added to the insulating polymer matrix. This critical concentration
of conductive filler where interconnected network is formed is known
as the percolation threshold.48,49 PDDA/MWCNT-DOC bilayers
form a version of this type of nanocomposite (i.e., conductive MWCNT
within insulating PDDA). As compared to previously reported studies,
the sheet resistance values for the present enzymatically modified
nylon are an order of magnitude greater, but these studies either
used more hydrophilic textile (e.g., polyester/cotton blend) or a
different type of carbon nanotubes (e.g., single-walled carbon nanotubes).50,51 It is well established that more hydrophobic textiles are more difficult
to coat, which typically leads to worse deposition and higher sheet
resistance values.52−54 Furthermore, altering the type of carbon nanotube
in these LbL-deposited coatings has been shown to improve sheet resistance.11 While these LbL coatings yield higher sheet
resistances than other studies, it is believed that changing the carbon
nanotube type would make the sheet resistances competitive with these
other studies.

Images of the conductive fabric, coated with
two PDDA/MWCNT-DOC
bilayers, are shown in Figure 6. Although nanotubes are present on the surface of both types
of fabric, the enzymatically modified sample has substantially greater
amount of MWCNT. The lower-magnification micrographs indicate that
a conductive network that contains more PDDA than MWCNT is formed
on the surface of the unmodified fabric (Figure 6c). This nanocoating is observed as a continuous
film on the surface of the fabric, with interconnecting fibers and
PDDA. The conductive network of the enzymatically modified sample
covers each fiber more individually than that observed on the unmodified
PA6.6 (Figure 6d).
The fabric coated with four bilayers is similar to the two-bilayer
coating for the unmodified PA6.6 fabric (Figure 6e). The conductive network of the enzymatically
modified fabric exhibits greater MWCNT content and intertube bridges
(Figure 6f), but this
4 BL coating still conformally covers each individual fiber.

Conclusions
Enzymatic modification is demonstrated
as a straightforward process
for achieving good hydrophilicity of PA6.6 fibers that is responsible
for more effective deposition of a conductive multilayer nanocoating.
Successful modification of PA6.6 is demonstrated by its smoother surface,
increased hydrophilicity, more carboxyl and amino groups, and more
positive charge above pH 3.6 (and more negative charge below pH 3.6)
than the unmodified fabric. This greater hydrophilicity and surface
charge improve the ability of the modified PA6.6 textile to accept
a water-based, functional nanocoating. Layer-by-layer deposition of
PDDA/MWCNT-DOC bilayers reduced sheet resistance of modified fabric
at a greater rate than the unmodified PA6.6. The conductive network
on the surface of the modified fabric had a better morphology from
that on the unmodified sample. The nanocoating covers each enzymatically
modified fiber conformally, with more MWCNT present that creates interfiber
bridges. This mild and environmentally friendly treatment could likely
be used to impart functionality to a variety of hydrophobic synthetic
fibers.

Experimental Section
Substrate and Materials
PA6.6 plain-weave
80 g/m2 fabric, supplied by Seattle Fabric (Seattle, WA),
was used
as the substrate for modification. Protease from Bacillus
licheniformis, Subtilisin A (EC number 3.4.21.62),
sodium phosphate buffer [Na2HPO4 (disodium phosphate),
NaH2PO4 (sodium dihydrogen phosphate)], Triton
X-100 (nonionic surfactant), Na2CO3, methylene
blue (C.I. 52015 cationic dye), acid orange 7 (C.I. 15510 anionic
acid dye), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (Mw, 100–200 kg/mol, 20 wt % aqueous solution), and
sodium deoxycholate (≥97%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Milwaukee, WI). Multiwalled carbon nanotubes were obtained from Bayer
Material Science (12–15 nm outer diameter and 4 nm inner diameter
and 1+ μm length; C ≥ 95 wt %; Leverkusen,
Germany). The enzyme has 2.4 U/g activity. One unit hydrolyzes casein
to produce a color equivalent to 1.0 mmol (181 μg) of tyrosine
per minute at pH 7.5 at 37 °C (color by the Folin–Ciocalteu
reagent). All solutions were prepared with 18.2 MΩ deionized
(DI) water. The conductive recipe consisted of a positively charged,
aqueous solution of 0.25 wt % PDDA, and a negatively charged dispersion
of 0.05 wt % MWCNT stabilized with 2.0 wt % DOC.10,11 Prior to use, the anionic solution was sonicated at 20 W for 30
min and slowly stirred for 0.5 h, while the cationic solution was
rolled for a minimum of 12 h to ensure full dissolution.9 All of the solutions were used without altering
their pH.

Enzymatic Modification of PA6.6 Fabric
The PA6.6 fabric
was first washed in a bath of 2 cm3/dm3 Triton
X-100 and 2 g/dm3 Na2CO3 with a 30:1
liquor ratio (LR), at 50 °C for 60 min, to remove all impurities.45 After that, the fabric was rinsed twice with
distilled water at 50 °C for 15 min. Enzymatic modification was
done in a bath with 30:1 LR at pH 6.8 (0.1 M phosphate buffer), using
5, 10, and 20%, on weight of the fabric (owf), protease enzyme at
60 °C for 60 min, according to a previously described procedure.38,45,55,56 The products of enzymatic hydrolysis were removed by treating the
fabric with 2 cm3/dm3 Triton X-100 and 2 g/dm3 Na2CO3 at 50 °C for 60 min.35 The modified fabric was rinsed twice with distilled
water at 50 °C for 15 min, rinsed in running cold tap water for
5 min, and dried in open air.

Layer-by-Layer Deposition
Multilayered nanocoatings
were deposited using a home-built automated dipping system.57 The PA.6.6 fabric was first immersed into a
0.25 wt % solution of PDDA for 5 min. The fabric was then submerged
in DI water for 1 min. The same dipping and rinsing procedure was
carried out with 0.05 wt % MWCNT in 2 wt % solution of DOC. This cycle
marks one bilayer deposited. The immersion times were reduced to 1
min for the subsequent deposition cycles, which were repeated until
the desired number of bilayers were deposited.

Characterization of Enzymatically
Modified Fabric
Images
of the fabric were collected using a JEOL (Akishima, Tokyo, Japan)
JSM-7500 field emission scanning electron microscope. Prior to imaging,
a 5 nm Pt/Pd coating was applied to the surface of the nylon fibers
to minimize charging. Fabric wettability (hydrophilicity) was determined
by measuring the time it takes for a drop of 1 cm3/dm3 Triton X-100 solution to be completely absorbed into the
fabric, according to the procedure described in the AATCC 79-2000
standard. The presented results are mean values of 10 measurements.
Surface wettability was evaluated using a CAM 200 optical contact
angle and surface tension meter (KSV Instruments, Ltd., Monroe, CT).
This goniometer is equipped with an autodispenser, a video camera,
and drop-shape analysis software. A drop of water (5 μL) was
pictured 3 min after deposition onto the fabric surface.

The
fabric was dyed with methylene blue and acid orange 7 for determining
carboxyl and amino groups present. Methylene blue dyeing was done
in a bath, with LR 100:1, 0.02 g/dm3 methylene blue in
Britton–Robinson buffer (pH 7.1–7.4) at 30 °C for
30 min, in an Incubating Mini Shaker (VWR, Radnor, PA) at 150 rpm.
Acid orange 7 dyeing was done in a bath with LR 100:1, 0.02 g/dm3 acid orange 7, pH 3 (adjusted by 1 M HCl) at 30 °C for
30 min in the VWR Incubating Mini Shaker at 150 rpm. The stained fabrics
were washed in a bath with LR 100:1, 1 cm3/dm3 Trixton X-100, at room temperature for 10 min and then rinsed in
running cold tap water for 10 min and air-dried. The color strength
(K/S) of the stained samples was
measured with a reflection spectrophotometer (X-Rite Color i7 spectrophotometer,
Grand Rapids, MI), using illuminant D65 with a 10°
standard observer. The K/S was calculated
from the reflectance values using the Kubelka–Munk equation  where R is the reflectance, K is the absorption
coefficient, and S is
the light scattering coefficient. The presented results are the mean
values of five measurements. Images of the dyed PA6.6 fabrics are
provided for visualization of the qualitative differences between
the unmodified and enzymatically modified samples. A Brookhaven-Paar
(Brookhaven, NY) electrokinetic analyzer was used to determine the
ζ-potential and isoelectric point (IEP) of the fabric in a 0.001
M potassium chloride solution.58 A range
of pH values of the electrolyte solution was investigated up to a
maximum of pH 11, achieved with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide, and then reduced
(ca. 1 pH unit) with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid.

Characterization of Nanocoated
Conductive Fabric
To
assess the electrical properties of the coated fabric, sheet resistance
was measured using a Signatone Pro4 Four-Point Probe (Gilroy, CA),
with 0.4 mm probe tip diameter and 1.0 mm tip spacing, connected to
a E3644A DC power supply (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara,
CA), with an operating voltage of 10 V and a 2400 Keithley Multimeter
(Cleveland, OH).11 Voltage and current
values were collected by LabVIEW (National Instruments Inc., Austin,
TX), using an SCB-68 Shield I/O Connecter Block. The reported sheet
resistance is the average of five measurements.
