A wide gap semiconductor material
has attracted attention as a
heterophotocatalyst because of its light harvesting nature to be used
in alternative energy production for the next generation. We, herein,
grow and synthesize ZnS(1–x)Ox series compounds using the chemical vapor
transport (CVT) method with I2 serving as the transport
agent. Different crystals, such as undoped ZnS and oxygen-doped ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12, revealed different bright palette emissions that were presented
in photoluminescence spectra in our previous report. To study the
electron–hole pair interaction of this sample series, the near-band-edge
transitions of the sample series were characterized in detail by photoconductivity
(PC) experiments. Additional results from surface photovoltage (SPV)
spectra also detected the surface and defect-edge transitions from
the higher oxygen-doped ZnS crystals. PC measurement results showed
a red-shift in the bandgap with increasing incorporation of oxygen
on ZnS. Consequently, the samples were subjected to photoirradiation
by xenon lamp for the degradation of methylene blue (MNB) by acting
as heterophotocatalysts. Undoped ZnS emerged as the best photocatalyst
candidate with the fastest rate constant value of 0.0277 min–1. In cubic {111} ZnS [{111} c-ZnS], the polarized Zn+ →
S– ions may play a vital role as a photocatalyst
because of their strong electron–hole polarization, which leads
to the mechanism for degradation of the MNB solution.

Introduction
Recently, natural energy
conversion has received greater attention
because of the current generation’s interest in an ecofriendly
life. Specifically, wide bandgap semiconductor photocatalysts have
played vital role in broad applications, such as solar cells, water
splitting, hydrogen evolution reactions, and pollutant degradation.1 The major criteria for good photocatalytic reaction
is based on photon absorption, photogenerated electron–hole
pairs, migration and recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole
pairs, adsorption–desorption of reactants–products,
and also redox reactions on the surface of photocatalyst.2−4 Furthermore, geometry (size, shape, and structure) of the materials
could also tune properties and their possible applications. The interface
reaction controlled the surface energy and reactivity, which were
dependent on various parameters, such as spatial conformation, structural
state of atoms, and molecules. In particular, single crystals were
directly connected to specific crystallographic faces that exhibited
dissimilar surface and atomic configurations to the polycrystalline
and amorphous thin films.5 Therefore, facet
effect had become an ideal character for a heterogeneous photocatalyst
that was highly sensitive to its surface orientation and crystallinity.
This also intrinsically decided the mechanism pathway of semiconductor
in the photocatalytic reaction, which were well satisfied aforementioned
criteria.6 TiO2 and ZnO are
well-known example of photocatalysts because of their abundant availability,
nontoxicity, and stability.7−9 They are only sensitive to ultraviolet
region because their bandgap is 3.2 eV in anatase-phase TiO2.5 On the other hand, ZnO acts as an alternative
photocatalyst because of its direct gap (3.37 eV) and larger exciton
binding energy of 60 meV. Morphology, geometry, crystallinity, and
oxygen defects mark them as efficient photocatalysts.10 Their major drawback is the fast recombination of electron
hole pair, which hindered superficial diffusion of charge carriers
and decreased the photodegradation of dye.11 However, zinc sulfide was a prime candidate because of its environment
friendly nature and also its theoretical ability to generate more
photocarriers than selenide and bromide. The direct bandgap of ZnS
semiconductor (∼3.7 eV and exciton binding energy ∼39
meV)12,13 is larger than that of the ZnO semiconductor
(∼3.37 eV and exciton binding energy is ∼60 meV).14,15 The gap states and band edge of ZnS would also facilitate the zinc
sulfide acting as a UV–visible photocatalyst. These materials
have two polymorphic phases, such as major sphalerite and minor wurtzite,16 which were similar to that of zinc oxide. The
preparation process was easy, and structural defects, such as sulfur
vacancies, twins, and stacking faults, were used in the crystal for
irradiating defect emissions.17 Despite
the advantages of ZnS described above, it still has the disadvantage
of being active only in the UV region. To overcome this issue, C or
N doping of a hierarchical porous microsphere of ZnS demonstrated
the ability to harvest visible light, which in turn degraded organic
pollutants to greater extend.18 Furthermore,
it has been reported that ternary crystals of ZnxCd1–xS performed as excellent
photocatalysts for the degradation environmental pollutants because
of the strong visible light absorption properties of CdS and tunable
band gap, achieved by changing mole ratio of Zn.19 ZnS/CuS nanospheres decorated on reduced graphene oxide
nanocomposite are highly efficient photocatalysts for dye degradation
under simulated sunlight.20 In our latest
literature survey, only one study focused on sampling for ZnS(1–x)Ox by annealing at 400 °C, but this study lacked an explanation
of the optical measurement.21 Our group
previously reported the color palette emission in ZnS(1–x)Ox (x = 0, 0.06, 0.12) series grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT)
method using I2 as transport agent.22 These sample series emitted UV, purple, blue and green
emission from photoluminescence spectra due to its defect state and
also free exciton. Moreover, the cubic zinc sulfide (c-ZnS) can also
act as heterogeneous photocatalysts for methyl blue degradation.23 In spite of that, they were still lacking evidence
about its photoconductivity (PC) capability as well as minor photogenerated
carriers could stimulate the surface voltaic output through surface
photovoltage (SPV) experiment. As a consequence, it would assist to
predict for reasoning interaction between the electron–hole
pair in the photodegradation of methylene blue (MNB) by the ZnS(1–x)Ox (x = 0, 0.06, 0.12) series crystals.

To further
address the photodegradation mechanism in zinc oxysulfide,
the present work would accurately categorize the oxygen-doped ZnS
series as a p-type semiconductor by hot-probe measurement using metal–semiconductor-metal
(MSM) configuration. These oxygen-incorporated ZnS series showed good
ohmic contact and, further, reduced dark resistivity as the oxygen
content increased. These sample series were sharply characterized
by PC and SPV measurements, which clearly showed absorption-band movement,
as well as the appearance of defect and surface-state edge transitions
for the identification of successful doping of oxygen in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. These sample series, such as undoped ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 may be better
heterophotocatalysts. However, among them, the {111} c-ZnS crystal was the better candidate for photodegradation of 50-μM
MNB with a rapid rate constant of k = 0.0277 min–1. In optical measurements, several SPV and PC features,
such as surface states, band edge, and valence sites, of the zinc
oxysulfide significantly affect the photodegradation of the MNB solution.
Hence, ZnS(1–x)Ox series may be suitable candidates for organic devices as photocatalysts
and applied in, for example, dye-sensitive solar cells (DSSCs) in
the near future.

Results and Discussion
Hot-Probe Measurement of
ZnS(1–x)Ox Series
The typical
semiconductors were easily categorized as n- or p-type by the MSM
model using hot-probe experiment. The contact ends of the sample were
prepared by using conductive paste (Ag) and metal wire. Once the voltmeter
was fixed on these sample series (ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, ZnS0.88O0.12), the heated end (soldering
iron heat source) became positive, while the cool end became negative
at room temperature (see Figure 1b). It created thermal gradient and generated high-density
carriers that diffused to the lower-temperature end of low carrier
density. For a p-type semiconductor, holes are excited and diffused
out from the hot end to the cold end, generating negative voltage
at hot end compared to that of the cold end. On the other hand, for
an n-type semiconductor, the electrons diffuse out by concentration
gradient, which creates positive voltage. For the hot-probe experiment
of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series, the soldering iron probe was heated to 170 °C
(see Figure 1a). The
soldering iron probe was kept in contact with the hot end of the sample
series, and the thermoelectric power (ΔV),
with the background subtracted, yielded −0.964 V for pure ZnS,
−0.620 V for ZnS0.94O0.06, and −0.518
V for ZnS0.88O0.12. The results are displayed
in Figure 1c–e.
The series samples are obviously p-type semiconductor distinguished
by the sign of thermal electromotive force (Seebeck voltage) ΔV by thermal gradient. The carriers’ diffusion current
could be dominated by the concentration of excited carriers, that
is, Δp = (pexcited – p0) for the thermally excited
holes in a p-type semiconductor, which expressed as24 1  where Ph = ΔV/ΔT is the differential thermoelectric
power (Seebeck coefficient) and ΔT/Δx is temperature gradient between hot and cold probes. The
sizes of the samples ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and
Zn0.88O0.12 are similar (i.e., see insets of Figure 1c–e and the
geometric information are shown in Figure 3c), and the cold-end temperature is ∼25
°C. The measured magnitudes of Seebeck coefficient (|ΔV/ΔT|) are determined to be 6.65,
4.27, and 3.57 mV/K for the ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12, respectively. The relatively
lower value of Seebeck coefficient of the ZnS0.88O0.12 sample maybe correlates with a lower resistivity of the
higher oxygen-contained ZnS. We will verify this result by resistivity
measurement. Moreover, the p-type conductivity of the CVT-grown chalcogenides
with ICl3 or I2 as the transport agent is usually
a result of the crystal growth, owing to the formation of sulfur–halogen
complex acceptor level, for example, (SCl)2– in
FeS2.25 The p-type conductivity
of the ZnS1–xOx (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.12) grown by iodine
transport is maybe also caused by a sulfur–iodine complex acceptor
level, noted as (SI)A, that existed in the crystals.

inset photos.

Optical Characterization
of Absorption Band, Defect Edge, and
Surface States
The series samples’ (named as ZnS(1–x)Ox) bright palette visible emissions upon laser illumination in photoluminescence
due to defect sites and band edge were previously illustrated.22 The ZnS(1–x)Ox crystals were shown to contain defects
of sulfur (VS) and oxygen vacancies (VO) because
of the deficiency of chalcogen and oxygen atoms in the crystals. Detailed
characterizations of defect and band-edge states can also be implemented
directly by using PC and SPV measurements from different axial orientations
to identify exact relationship of these samples with photon. For PC
measurements, the {111}-face sample was cut down in rectangle shape,
the electric field ε was applied in ε⊥⟨111⟩
direction, and the incident photons were impinged on the {111} plane.
Frequency-dependent PC measurements were carried out to identify various
transition features by defects, imperfections, and band edges in ZnS(1–x)Ox. The results are shown in Figure S1.
From the relative peak-intensity changes of the frequency-dependent
PC spectra in ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12, some of the peak features, such as sulfur
vacancy (VS), sulfur–iodine complex acceptor level
(SI)A, and main absorption band, are detected. Essentially,
the intensity of each PC feature decreases with chopped frequency
as the incident light increases. Figure 2a shows the selective PC spectra of ZnS,
ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 at 25 Hz, which are more relevant to show all the defect and imperfection-related
transitions. The main absorption band is marked in the yellow-highlighted
region, where the PC peak positions of the ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 series crystal
were determined to be 3.801, 3.798, and 3.767 eV at 300 K. As the
oxygen content is increased, the main PC peak is also red-shifted.
On the other hand, the PC intensity is also decreased when the oxygen
content is increased evident from the magnification scale in Figure 2a. It may be related
to both resistivity and photosensitivity of ZnS(1–x)Ox being decreased.
For ZnS, there is a PC peak feature present at 3.64 eV below band
edge. It is inferred to come from the acceptor level (SI)A in the p-type ZnS. This (SI)A defect feature can also
be found in the SPV spectra of ZnS(1–x)Ox [e.g., ZnS and ZnS0.88O0.12] below main band edge displayed in Figure 2b. The SPV spectra of the ZnS(1–x)Ox in Figure 2b are
detected by a surface Schottky solar-cell structure of Cu/ZnS(1–x)Ox (x = 0, 0.06, and 0.12). The SPV measurement configuration can measure
and enhance the imperfection states of ZnS(1–x)Ox coming from the surface states.
For the x = 0.12 sample in Figure 2b, two obvious transition features coming
from sulfur vacancy VS (∼2.8 eV)22 and ZnO (Eg ZnO ∼3.2
eV) can be detected by the SPV spectrum. The occurrence of VS also indicated that incorporation of oxygen was successfully grown
on the sulfur vacant site in these sample series.26 Furthermore, the PC spectra in Figure 2a can also detect the main band feature of
the ZnO (Eg ZnO) in the highest oxygen-incorporated
ZnS0.88O0.12 sample owing to the existence of
separated phases. The result was also evident in previous thermoreflectance
measurement.22Figure 2c shows the representative band scheme for
the band edge, defect, and imperfection states detected by above optical
and thermoelectric experiments. Essentially, the band-edge transition
of {111} c-ZnS is about 3.77 eV. The separated phase of ZnO can exist
in the ZnS(1–x)Ox of higher oxygen content. The transition energy of valence-band
edge (EV) to the sulfur vacancy VS is about 2.8 eV. The existence of (SI)A acceptor
near EV can render a p-type conductivity
of the ZnS(1–x)Ox, which verified by hot-probe experiment. The band scheme in Figure 2c could further facilitate
the analysis of photocatalytic behavior of the ZnS(1–x)Ox crystal photocatalyst
in the dye degradation.

series crystals. (c) The representative scheme for the band edge and

Electrical-Resistivity
Measurement of ZnS(1–x)Ox
For the
evaluation of electrical conductivity of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals,
voltage–current (V–I) measurements of the three samples investigated by hot-probe experiments
are also carried out under dark condition. Figure 3a depicts the V–I measurement results measured with MSM configuration for the ZnS(1–x)Ox series plates with Ag coating two ends of the samples. The experiments
were done under dark condition, and voltage scanning range was from
−200 to +200 V. It is clear that the dark resistance
is very high owing to the high purity and wide bandgap of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals. The values of dark resistivity (5.51 MΩ cm
for ZnS, 4.96 MΩ cm for ZnS0.94O0.06,
and 4.43 MΩ cm for ZnS0.88O0.12) are much
higher than that of an N-doped p-ZnS thin film grown by metalorganic
vapor phase epitaxy.27 It shows the high
purity of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series samples. From Figure 3a, it also displays good ohmic-contact behavior
after applying a linear fitting equation to its linearity. Figure 3b shows the values
of dark resistivity of ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and
ZnS0.88O0.12. The dark resistances are tabulated
in Figure 3c for comparison
together with the dimensions of the three ZnS(1–x)Ox samples are also
included. The value of resistivity decreases as the oxygen content
is increased in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. It is maybe owing to the higher
defect and surface-state density existed in the higher oxygen-incorporated
ZnS.

and length of pure ZnS and oxygen-doped ZnS. The left inset shows

Ideal II–VI Crystal
Photocatalyst for Methylene Blue
Degradation
On the basis of the defect and imperfection-state
study described above, ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals used for photocatalytic
degradation of organic pollutants were evaluated. A 50 μM methylene
blue (MNB, C16H18ClN3S) solution
was used for simulation of the degradation target. The area of sample
size was about 3 × 2 mm2 and the volume of the MNB
solution is about 4 mL. Figure 4a–d show the normalized absorbance spectra of the solutions’
photocatalytic degradation of 50 μM MNB with and without ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals as the photocatalyst. The Xe-arc lamp’s white
light (consists of mixed wavelength from ultra to visible and infrared
region) was irradiated on MNB, ZnS + MNB, ZnS0.94O0.06 + MNB, and ZnS0.88O0.12 + MNB, and
the spectra were recorded at time intervals of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40,
50, and 60 min. The absorbance spectra of MNB have generally the largest
absorption peak close to 660 nm, maximum absorption intensities of
the MNB solutions were in the region of 550–700 nm, where at
least two absorption peaks of 610 and 660 nm could be clearly observed.
As photoillumination time was increased, the speed of the MNB degradation
occurred in the order of pure {111} c-ZnS > ZnS0.94O0.06 > ZnS0.88O0.12 > MNB. The
results
were directly shown by absorption intensity at 660 nm and with decreasing
tendency shown in Figure 4a–d. The photoreaction decay of the MNB degradation
with time can be analyzed using normalized rate equation as28 2  where k is the rate constant
for the photodegraded reaction. The normalized concentration change
(C/C0) versus degradation
time for the ZnS(1–x)Ox series was shown in Figure 5. To determine the rate constant k for all these samples series the exponential decay of
the MNB degradation using eq 2 is analyzed. The best fit was remarked in red solid lines
displayed in Figure 5. The photodegradation rate constants k of MNB for
the pure ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, ZnS0.88O0.12, and MNB samples were determined to be 0.0277, 0.0242,
0.0113, and 0.005 min–1, respectively. The k value for photodegradation of pure {111} c-ZnS sample
is the greatest among them. On comparison, pure ZnS is about 1.14
times higher than ZnS0.94O0.06 (x = 0.06), 2.45 times higher than ZnS0.88O0.12 (x = 0.12), and 5.26 times higher than pure MNB.
It is a well-known fact that pure MNB complete degradation occurs
at slower interval (approximately 200 min), which also reflects same
behavior when they were exposed to visible light. The complete degradation
time of MNB itself in Figure 5 is still much longer than that in the presence of the ZnS(1–x)Ox crystal photocatalysts. A well-known phenomenon is that a highest k value would have a maximum photodegradation ratio.29Scheme 1a represents a simple mechanism of photocatalytic degradation
of MNB using {111} c-ZnS as the photocatalyst. It is known that the
zinc-blende {111} face has the same atomic arrangement as that of
wurtzite {0001} excepting that the stacking sequence of the zinc-blende
phase is in ABCABC stacking along the ⟨111⟩ direction,
while that of the wurtzite ZnS is stacking with ABAB order along the
⟨0001⟩ direction.30,31 Both the two ZnS phases
of zinc-blende {111} and wurtzite {0001} have the same ZnS4 tetrahedron, where the wurtzite structure has certain deformation
to cause the separation of centers of the positive and negative charges
of Zn+ and S–. The distortion of ZnS4 unit in wurtzite {0001} results in dipole moments and internal
electrical field, which benefits to the transfer and separation of
photogenerated electrons and holes. For a perfect zinc-blende {111}
plane, there is no distortion in the ZnS4 unit. However,
the defects (e.g., VS, etc.) in c-ZnS should have slightly
deformed ZnS4 units to create dipole and internal field
in the {111} c-ZnS. That is the reason why the undoped {111} c-ZnS
has the fastest degradation rate in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series, as shown
in Figure 5. As shown
in Scheme 1a, with
the {111} c-ZnS crystal was irradiated by Xe-arc lamp, electrons in
the valence band (VB) were transited to the conduction band (CB) for
production electronic–hole pairs. In the indirect oxidation
process of dyes, the hydroxyl reactive radicals (•OH = OH– + h+) were formed by combination
of holes with water molecules or hydroxide anions.32,33 This reaction also generates hydroperoxyl radicals (O2 + e– → •O2– and •O2–+H+ → •HO2) and hydroxyl
radicals (•OH) to degrade organic pollutants.34 The valence-band potential (h+) is
positive enough to generate hydroxyl radicals on the ZnS surface,
and the conduction-band potential (e–) was significantly
negative to reduce molecular oxygen near the environment.29 More hydroxyl radicals and photocarriers will
be generated because of the high population of electron–hole
pairs, which makes {111} c-ZnS a powerful oxidizing agent. Such a
powerful photocatalytic mechanism attacks the MNB solution on or near
the surface of ZnS to remove the organic pollutants. Whereas the oxygen-doped
ZnS series crystals (e.g., ZnS0.88O0.12) also
generate reactive hydroxyl radicals, but electrons are easy to get
trapped in between the bands. In addition, the ZnO phase existed in
the oxygen-doped samples and promoted fast recombination of electron–hole
pair by the ZnO crystal phase. The fast recombination (less carrier
lifetime) of the ZnO band edge will significantly increase the degradation
time of the MNB solution.11,29,35,36 The detailed photodegradation
mechanisms of the oxygen-incorporated ZnS are demonstrated in Scheme 1b for comparison.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the transition
states, vacant sites, near band-edge
properties, and photocatalytic behavior of II–VI oxygen-incorporated
ZnS and ZnS(1–x)Ox (x = 0, 0.06, and 0.12) have been evaluated
in detail. These series crystals were grown by CVT method with I2 as the transport agent. The possible incorporation of iodine
into the ZnS(1–x)Ox series results in p-type conductivity, which is
evident by hot-probe experiment. From the comparison of optical measurements,
including PC and SPV measurements, possible defects, such as sulfur
vacancy VS, p-type acceptor level (SI)A, and
a ZnO second phase are observed to exist in the ZnS(1–x)Ox. A xenon-arc white
light and 50 μM MNB solution are used for testing the photodegradation
ability of organic pollutants by the crystal photocatalysts. The undoped
{111} c-ZnS shows the fastest photodegradation rate owing to the existence
of dipole moment and internal electric field created by defect deformed
{111} cubic ZnS. Whereas more imperfection states and the occurrence
of ZnO second phase in the higher oxygen-incorporated ZnS(1–x)Ox significantly decrease
the photodegradation ability of the crystal photocatalyst. The {111}
c-ZnS emerges out as the best heterophotocatalyst without any adsorption
of methylene blue. It can be an efficient crystal photocatalyst for
application in energy and environment use.

Experimental Section
Preparation
of ZnS(1–x)Ox Series Single Crystals by CVT Method
ZnS(1–x)Ox series, such as pure
ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.6, and ZnS0.88O0.12 crystals, were grown by
the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method using I2 as transport
agent. Detailed procedure for the CVT growth of doped and undoped
ZnS(1–x)Ox series was described elsewhere.22,37 The growth
temperature was setting as 1000 °C (heating zone) → 950
°C (growth zone) with gradient −2.5 °C/cm to the
quartz ampules. The reaction keeps 300 h for production large single
crystals. With increasing oxygen content, the color changed, fresh
pale yellowish color, a dark yellow color, and pure white color in
the as-grown ZnS0.88O0.12, ZnS0.94O0.6, and pure ZnS crystals, respectively. Energy dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectra clearly identified the content ratio of the ZnS(1–x)Ox sample series. The lattice constant decreased as the increase in
oxygen incorporation were already characterized by X-ray diffraction,
high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), selective-area
electron diffraction (SAED), and fast Fourier transformation (FFT).22 The transmittance absorption edge was observed
to red-shift, 3.69 (ZnS), 3.65 (ZnS0.94O0.06), and 3.61 eV (ZnS0.88O0.12), owing to the
increase in the oxygen content of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. Furthermore, each band-edge and
valence-band splitting transitions EA, EB, and EC were clearly
detected in the thermoreflectance (TR) spectra of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals.
The photoluminescence (PL) measurements containing a free-exciton
(Fx) emission peak in each of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals at low temperature
also exhibited strong visible defects, displaying green, blue, and
purple colors. The luminescent defects of the series were also shown.22

Chemical Reagent and Materials Prepared
Methylene blue
(C16H18ClN3S) was purchased from
Kojima Chemical Co., Ltd. Deionized water, magnetic stirrer, copper
plate, and Xenon-arc lamp (with LPS-250 power supply) were from Photonics
Technology International (PTI).

Hot Probe and I–V Measurements
A hot point probe
for ZnS(1–x)Ox series was constructed using MSM model,
which was a simple and rapid method to classify conductivity type
of semiconductors. The experiment used KEITHLEY 182 voltmeter attached
to the sample, where the positive end had been heated (soldering iron
as the heating source) and the negative end was maintained at room
temperature. The temperature was measured using a TES 1310 TYPE-K
thermometer. Heat sources could increase the number of carriers in
the semiconductor. The main carriers will move from the high temperature
end to the room temperature end by the carriers’ diffusion
mechanism. The sign of thermal electromotive force measured from the
voltmeter could reveal conductivity type of the semiconductor. The I–V measurements of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series were performed by the auxiliary of a Keithley 2614B source
measure unit. The voltage scanning range was set at −200 to
200 V.

Photoconductivity (PC) and Surface Photovoltage (SPV) Measurements
The PC and SPV experiments do not require any optical sensor because
photodetector is the sample itself. For SPV measurement, a ZnS(1–x)Ox plate was attached on a copper sample holder by silver paste; the
holder acts as the bottom electrode of the measurements. The top surface
of sample can be micropatterned and coated with either golden or copper
mesh on the sample plane. This was the top electrode of the SPV measurement.38 The photoexcited electron–hole pairs
from the surface band-bending region were extracted out from the top
and bottom electrodes of the capacitor-like configuration and then
sent to a low noise amplifier. The incident light was chopped with
frequencies of 5–200 Hz, and the photoelectric conversion response
(from the low-noise amplifier) of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series was recorded via an
EG&G model 7265 lock-in amplifier. For PC measurement, the ZnS(1–x)Ox series samples were cut down into a rectangular shape with Ag paste
coated two ends acting as the ohmic contact electrodes. The major
difference between SPV and traditional PC measurements was the direction
of the electric field to the sample. The SPV is related to the surface
band bending and sensitive to the surface states. The PC result is
more relevant to the defects and band-edge state of the bulk crystal.
The monochromatic light source for the SPV and PC experiments was
provided by a PTI 0.2-m monochromator equipped with a 150 W Xe-arc
lamp. All the measured PC and SPV spectral photoresponses were calibrated
using a OPHIR optical power meter equipped with broadband and high
sensitivity thermal sensor.

Measurements of Photochemical Reaction for
ZnS(1–x)Ox Series
A
150 W Xe-arc lamp was optimized with a power density of about 10 mW·cm–2 for acting as the illuminated light source to the
50 μM methylene blue (MNB) solution (i.e., each MNB solution
of 4 mL with presence of 20 mg ZnS(1–x)Ox crystal)]. The light transmission
measurement was performed by a QE65000 spectrometer that combined
with a 50 W tungsten halogen lamp acting as the light source. The
transmission light was guided by an optical fiber and then transmitted
and coupled to the spectrometer. The transmittance spectra were calculated
and recorded by a personal computer.
