Biobased poly(butylene
succinate) (BioPBS) was electrospun to create
hierarchical, highly porous fibers. Various grades of BioPBS were
dissolved in one of the three solutions: chloroform, a co-solvent
system of chloroform/N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), or chloroform/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). These solutions were
then electrospun at room temperature to produce nanoporous micron-sized
fibers. The variables investigated were the solvent system used, grade
of BioPBS, concentration of BioPBS, applied voltage, and the distance
between the electrodes. In determining the optimal solution and electrospinning
conditions, it was found that solution properties such as the solvent
system, the grade of BioPBS, and the concentration of BioPBS had a
significant effect on the fiber morphology. A chloroform/DMSO cosolvent
system resulted in less bead defects among fibers compared to those
produced from chloroform/DMF systems, regardless of the BioPBS grade.
An increase in BioPBS concentration resulted in the reduction of bead
defects, which at 15 (% w/v) resulted in bead-free uniform fibers.
Increasing BioPBS concentration also increased the porosity of the
fibers while reducing the pore size. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed
that the reduction of bead defects resulted in increased tensile strength
and Young’s modulus of the electrospun fibrous nonwoven mat.
The results of this study show that electrospun BioPBS fibers have
high porosity at the micro- and nanoscale, resulting in a hierarchical
structure that has sufficient mechanical properties for potential
applications in wound healing and soft tissue engineering.

Introduction
Biodegradable aliphatic polyesters have
seen an increase in popularity
across a wide variety of fields, due in part to the increases in global
carbon dioxide levels and immense amounts of plastic waste. Polymers
such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly(glycolic
acid) (PGA), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)
(PHBV), and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) are in high demand for
biomedical applications such as implant devices, tissue scaffolds,
and wound dressings.1 These polymers are
ideal for these applications because of their biodegradability, biocompatibility,
and high capacity for drug loading.1 Electrospinning
has become one of the most popular methods for the preparation of
micro- to nano-sized fibrous polymers. However, the electrospinnability
of BioPBS, and more importantly, the relationships between process
parameters and the resulting morphology and mechanical properties
have not been fully described in previous research. PBS is produced
by the esterification of succinic acid with 1,4-butanediol; the current
industrial process utilizes approximately 54% biobased content in
the production of PBS in the form of biosuccinic acid (Bio-SA).2 However, with further industrialization, Bio-SA
can be used to produce 1,4-butanediol,3 which would lead to 100% biobased PBS.

Nanotechnology is a
promising multidisciplinary field that combines
the state-of-the-art technology with cutting-edge scientific research.
Among the many methods utilized to produce materials at this scale,
none have seen more widespread use than electrospinning.4 Electrospinning is a simplistic, cost-effective,
and an adaptable method that uses an electrically charged jet of polymer
solution to produce fibers with diameters ranging from micro- to nanometers.5 A typical electrospinning setup involves a voltage
source (1–30 kV), a needle or capillary, a syringe pump, and
a grounded surface for fibers to be collected on.5 Electrospinning is capable of producing a wide range of
morphologies including hollow tubes, highly aligned fibers, and even
3D shapes.6 This is especially advantageous
in the production of biomaterials: by adjusting solution properties,
electrospinning parameters, or ambient conditions, tailorable hierarchical
structures can be produced.7 Morphological
and mechanical properties can then be matched to the desired biological
environment, from advanced wound dressings8 to load bearing implants that encourage cell growth and osseointegration.9

Many biomedical applications require highly
porous materials, which
allows for the proper integration of cells and blood vessels, transportation
of nutrients and wastes, or increased drug loading capacity.10 Materials chosen for these applications should
mimic the biological environment they are meant to interact with or
replace. Biological environments are often complex and hierarchical
in nature with different macro-, meso-, and nanoscale structures.11 Generally, mesopores should be between 100 and
400 μm but can vary greatly depending on the type of tissue
in question.11 Nanopores between 10 and
1000 nm are required to facilitate the transportation of nutrients
and metabolic wastes.11 It is advantageous
for a material to match the hierarchical structure of the biological
environment it is to be used in, to improve its biocompatibility.
Biodegradable and biocompatible polymers such as PCL, PLA, PGA, and
their co-polymers have been successfully electrospun and are used
in various biomedical applications.12−17 Similarly, the electrospinnability of PBS has also been investigated.18−22 PBS is soluble in various solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3), dichloromethane (DCM), 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol,
and o-chlorobenzene.23−25 However, PBS has only
been successfully electrospun in CHCl3 or DCM with the
addition of other cosolvents.18−22

As PBS is often in solution in dilute concentrations, the
solvent
used has a significant influence on the overall solution properties,
such as surface tension, boiling point, conductivity, and permittivity.18 The resulting morphology of the fibers is subsequently
affected by the choice of the solvent and ambient conditions.26,27 Wannatong et al.28 investigated the effects
of solvent properties on the resulting morphology of electrospun polystyrene
fibers. Fiber diameter was found to decrease with increasing boiling
points and density of the solvent, whereas the throughput increased
with increased dielectric constant and dipole moment.28 Jeong et al.19 successfully
added various cosolvents such as 2-chloroethanol (CE), 3-chloro-1-propanol
(3-CP), and 1-chloro-2-propanol (1-CP) to both CHCl3 and
DCM solvent systems. Klairutsamee et al.18 electrospun PBS fibers from both N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol. They also investigated the
effects of adding an organic salt alkyl ammonium ethyl sulfate (AAES)
on the morphology of PBS fibers. They found that the addition of salts
to the solution resulted in thinner fibers, dropping from 503 to 373
nm with the addition of 0.25–1 (% w/v) AAES.18 In fact, the addition of 0.5 (% w/v) AAES to 12 (% w/v)
PBS in a CHCl3 solution caused a drastic change in the
fiber morphology, changing from highly beaded fibers to smooth and
continuous fibers.18 This improved the
electrospinnability, evident from the morphological changes, and can
be attributed to an increase in solution conductivity and charge density
at the jet.29,30 This ultimately increased the
elongation force experienced by the fibers as the excess charge creates
self-repulsion within the electric field, suppressing the axial symmetric
instability,18 known as Rayleigh instability.31

The morphology of electrospun fibers is
a key determinant in both
the physical and mechanical properties of the resulting product. Any
anomaly or abnormality along the fiber may cause a significant decrease
in strength.32,33 Much of the electrospinning literature
focuses on how various parameters affect the fiber morphology.34−40 Several factors affect the electrospinning process, which can be
broken down into process parameters, solution properties, and ambient
conditions.41 Processing parameters are
those that are controlled by the electrohydrodynamic setup, such as
the applied electric field, electrode gap (EG), and flow rate. Solution
properties include polymer concentration, viscosity, molecular weight,
conductivity, and surface tension. Ambient conditions include temperature
and humidity.

In this study, electrospun nonwoven mats were
prepared using two
different grades of BioPBS in a single solvent CHCl3 system,
as well as cosolvent systems consisting of CHCl3 with dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and CHCl3 with DMF. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, no report has been conducted to demonstrate
the effects of DMSO on the electrospinning of PBS. The effects of
using different solvent systems, BioPBS grades, BioPBS concentrations,
applied voltages, and distances between electrodes on the morphological
differences in fiber diameter and diameter distribution of electrospun
BioPBS fibers were studied. Various polymer concentrations were prepared
to determine the relationship between morphology and subsequent tensile
strength and porosity. The fiber morphology and porosity were determined
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the tensile properties
of the fibers were measured using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).
It was found that solution properties such as solvent system, the
grade of BioPBS, and the concentration of BioPBS used had a significant
effect on the fiber morphology. This had a subsequent effect on both
porosity and tensile properties. This study demonstrates the electrospinnability
of BioPBS, capable of creating nanoporous fibers that have the potential
for use in biomedical or tissue engineering applications.

Discussion
Solution Properties
Solvent System
Under ambient conditions
(19–21
°C, 55–65% relative humidity), BioPBS was not electrospinnable
in CHCl3. The low boiling point of CHCl3 compared
to other solvents (Table 1) resulted in rapid evaporation of the solvent at the tip
of the needle. This evaporation prevented the formation of a Taylor
cone (circled in Figure 1a) and eventually led to a build-up of BioPBS at the tip of the needle,
circled in Figure 1b. Although the electrospinning process can be conducted without
the formation of a Taylor cone, a Taylor cone is required to produce
continuous defect-free fibers.41 To reduce
the evaporation rate of the solution, solvents with lower vapor pressures
and high boiling points were added to CHCl3 to form a cosolvent
system. DMSO and DMF were chosen as cosolvents because both possess
high boiling points and low vapor pressures compared to CHCl3, as shown in Table 1. However, BioPBS is insoluble in both DMSO and DMF, which can be
attributed to the differences in Hansen solubility parameters between
BioPBS and DMSO or DMF.42 The total Hansen
solubility parameters given in Table 1 are based on three bond energies: dispersion, polar,
and hydrogen bonds, which contain information about the intermolecular
interactions of the solution.42 These three
parameters can be used as coordinates for a point in three-dimensional
space, known as Hansen space.42 The closer
the substances are to each other in Hansen space, the more likely
they are to dissolve each other.42 This
is an approximation only, and there are limitations to using this
method such as not accounting for parameters varying with temperature,
molecular bonding being more complicated than three parameters, molecular
size and shape, and dipole, electrostatic, and metallic interactions.42

As PBS is not soluble in either
DMSO or DMF, a cosolvent system
is needed. When more than 10% of DMF (results not shown) or DMSO was
added to both grades of BioPBS dissolved in CHCl3, gelation
rapidly occurred as the solution cooled to room temperature. Figure 2 shows the gelation
of BioPBS in different fractions of DMSO/CHCl3 as the solution
was cooled to room temperature. Solutions of 30, 40, and 50% DMSO/CHCl3 and DMF/CHCl3 solidified before the solution could
return to room temperature. 20% co-solvent systems returned to room
temperature as a liquid but solidified shortly after, restricting
the time available for electrospinning to approximately 1 h. This
limitation in processing time would severely hinder the solution’s
practical and industrial potential. Incredibly large throughputs would
be needed to produce macroscale products. Conversely, a continuous
production method could be utilized instead of a batch process to
overcome this limitation. However, 20% cosolvent systems were not
used further in this study. Both 10% DMSO/CHCl3 and DMF/CHCl3 sufficiently reduced the evaporation rate of the solution,
allowing the formation of a Taylor cone.

Figure 2 Effect of increased fractions
of DMSO added to 15 (w/v %) BioPBS
in CHCl3.

With the amount of cosolvent chosen to be 10%, both the solvent
system and BioPBS grade that resulted in the best morphology could
be selected. Both DMSO and DMF cosolvent systems showed an outward
effect on the morphology regardless of which BioPBS grade was used. Figure 3 shows a drastic
change in the morphology from beaded fibers to continuous smooth fibers
between film grade solutions using DMF (Figure 3a) and DMSO (Figure 3b). A similar but less drastic change can
be seen in injection grade solutions where a transition from beaded
to nonbeaded fibers was not observed. However, the frequency of the
beads was drastically decreased in DMSO (Figure 3c) compared to DMF (Figure 3d). This morphological change can be attributed
to the changes in surface tension and conductivity of the solutions
between DMF and DMSO cosolvent systems. Table 2 summarizes solution properties measured
in this study for single solvent CHCl3 solutions, cosolvent
systems, as well as FO solutions at 5, 10, and 15 (% w/v) BioPBS concentration.
The conductivity of both the film and injection grade BioPBS increased
when DMSO was used compared to DMF (Figure 4c), which could partially explain the improved
morphology observed in DMSO solvent systems compared to DMF. More
importantly, the differences in surface tension observed between DMF
and DMSO were more profound in film grade solutions (11.9 mN/m) compared
to injection grade solutions (5.13 mN/m). This further explains why
a more drastic change in morphology was observed in DMSO cosolvent
systems compared to DMF.41 Surface tension
is a function of the polymer solution, including the solvent; various
solvents can be used to adjust the surface tension of the solution.
In general, low surface tension encourages the electrospinning process
to occur in lower electric fields,41 which
is advantageous for many reasons including the reduction of processing
costs.

Many
researchers have investigated how choice of solvent effects
on the resulting fiber morphology, specifically its dielectric constant
and boiling point.28,46,47 Wannatong et al.28 investigated several
different solvents with various properties such as density, dielectric
constant, and boiling point, and their effect on electrospun polystyrene
fibers. They measured the productivity of fiber production (number
of fibers per square meter per time) and found that the fiber productivity
increased as the dielectric constant of the solvent increased. It
was also found that as the boiling point of the solvent increased
the diameter of fibers decreased.28 Casasola
et al.46 found a similar relationship between
the fiber diameter of electrospun PLA fibers and the boiling point
of the cosolvent in a two solvent system; as the boiling point of
the co-solvent increased, fiber diameter decreased. DMSO has a higher
boiling point relative to DMF (Table 1), using solvents with higher boiling points results
in lower rates of evaporation. This allows the polymer jet to retain
its viscoelastic properties longer, resulting in longer exposure to
stretching forces, producing smaller diameter fibers.46 This further explains the improved morphology observed
when electrospun from DMSO co-solvent systems compared to DMF.

The dielectric constant (ε) of the solvent system also affects
the resultant fiber morphology.18,28,30,48 Both cosolvents used in this
study have a higher ε relative to CHCl3, which could
explain the improved electrospinnability observed by the addition
of either DMF or DMSO to CHCl3. Furthermore, DMSO has a
higher ε relative to DMF, which could also explain the differences
in morphology observed in Figure 3. An increase in ε results in an increase in
solution conductivity;18,30,47 this results in more self-repelling charges on the surface of the
polymer jet, increasing the Coulombic stretching force resulting in
a stronger elongation force.18 A decrease
in solution conductivity will result in insufficient elongation of
the Taylor cone, resulting in the formation of undesirable beads.36 An increase in solution conductivity can considerably
decrease the fiber diameter, and the availability of ionic salts can
also create smaller diameter fibers.34 This
increased charge density suppresses the Rayleigh instability experienced
by the polymer jet, increasing the bending instability experienced
by the electrospun fiber. The subsequent change in fiber morphology
observed between DMSO and DMF cosolvent systems suggests a strong
correlation between the aforementioned solvent properties and morphology.18,49

PBS Grade
The major difference between the two grades
of BioPBS is the reported melt flow index (MFI), 5 g/10 min and 22
g/10 min, for film and injection grade, respectively.50 Bremner et al.51 established
a relationship between MFI and the molecular weight distribution (MWD)
using both viscosity average molecular weight (M̅v) and weight average molecular weight M̅w. The most practical MWD to measure is M̅v by solution rheology and obtains a good correlation
coefficient (R2 = 0.93) by a linear least
squares fit with the natural log of MFI.51 It is important to note that if a solvent is used in the rheological
analysis, then M̅v will be a function
of both the properties of the solvent and the polymer’s inherent
molecular weight.51 Systems involving highly
branched polymers or non-Newtonian polymer solutions are more complicated
and require full rheological characterization of the polymer.51 The lower MFI of film grade BioPBS could be
an indicator of a higher MWD, which explains the improved electrospinnability
of the film grade BioPBS compared to the injection grade observed
in Figure 3. Research
suggests that the molecular weight of the polymer plays a significant
role in its ability to be electrospun into defect-free fibers.4,27,41,52,53 This is due to its significant effect on
solution properties such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension.53 Koski et al.53 varied
the molecular weight of poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA from 9000 to 50 000
g/mol and observed a drastic change in the fiber morphology. PVA with
lower molecular weights (9000–10 000 g/mol) produced beaded
fibers, whereas PVA with molecular weights between 13 000 and 23 000
g/mol produced defect-free fibers. Further increases in molecular
weight (from 31 000 to 50 000 g/mol) resulted in flattened fibers.
If the difference in MFI of the BioPBS is inversely proportional to
the molecular weight of the BioPBS as Bremner et al.51 reported, then the improved electrospinnability of film
grade BioPBS relative to the injection grade can be attributed to
an increase in the molecular weight between film and injection grade
BioPBS.

PBS Concentration and Solution Viscosity
The same trend
seen in the MFI of the film and injection grade BioPBS was observed
in the solution’s complex viscosities, shown in Figure 4a. Regardless of the solvent
used film grade BioPBS have higher complex viscosities compared to
injection grade BioPBS. Further, an increase in the BioPBS concentration
resulted in an increase in the viscosity of that solution because
of an increase in polymer chain entanglements and molecular cohesion.41 Film grade BioPBS solutions were prepared in
DMSO cosolvent systems with BioPBS concentrations of 5, 10, and 15%
(w/v), labeled FO-5, FO-10, and FO-15 respectively. A polymer solution
has to have an optimal concentration, too high a concentration can
prevent the polymer motion and too low the concentration will inhibit
the appropriate polymer entanglements required to create fibers.36,41,48,49 Polymer concentration is one of the most crucial variables in the
electrospinning process, a minimum concentration is necessary to produce
fibers, whereas a higher concentration is necessary to produce bead-free
fibers, as lower concentration solutions are prone to the formatio
of unwanted droplets throughout the fiber because of the unbalanced
effects of viscosity and the Coulombic stretching force.54 This morphology is observed in FO-5 (Figure 5a) and to a lesser
degree in FO-10, as shown in Figure 5b. In FO-5, the viscosity is significantly lower than
the FO-10 or FO-15 solutions; thus the Coulombic stretching force
is far greater than the solution’s viscosity and causes the
jet to break-up into spherical droplets (roundness = 0.70 ± 0.17)
held by surface tension.18 In FO-10, the
solution has sufficient viscosity to maintain the fibrous form. However,
the Coulombic stretching force is still imbalanced with respect to
solution properties such as surface tension and viscosity. The Rayleigh
instability is still prominent compared to the bending instability,
which resulted in elongated beads (roundness = 0.55 ± 0.15).
Bead-free fibers were observed in FO-15 solutions, as shown in Figure 5c. This is likely
due to the further increase in viscosity and limited increase in surface
tension, as illustrated in Figure 4a,b, respectively. The larger increase in viscosity
relative to surface tension suppressed the Rayleigh instability in
favor of the bending instability, which resulted in increased elongation
forces, resulting in defect-free fibers.18,47 The concentration of the solution to be spun was found to have the
greatest effect on fiber properties. When the solution concentration
is low, there is not enough molecular cohesion to stabilize the jet
required to produce the fibers; hence destabilization of the jet occurs,
resulting in the production of fine spherical particles.55 The charged droplets naturally resist agglomeration
and coagulation because of the electrostatic repulsion, resulting
in particles with very small diameters, smaller than a conventional
mechanical atomizer.56 When the molecular
cohesion in the solution is high enough, a stable jet can be produced
from the Taylor cone, resulting in the production of a continuous
fiber,41 as observed in Figure 5c.

electrospun at 15 kV, flow rate of 1.5 mL/h, 20 cm electrode gap with
various polymer concentrations (w/v %): (a) 5, (b) 10, and (c) 15.

Viscosity is dependent on the
polymer being used, as different
polymer solutions have different viscoelastic properties. However,
regardless of the type of polymer used, a minimum viscosity is essential
to produce smooth and bead-free nanofibers. To electrospin neat, defect-free
fibers, the polymer concentration must be at least twice the entanglement
concentration (EC). The EC is a boundary between an unentangled and
entangled solution. In an unentangled solution, the polymer chains
overlap but do not entangle, whereas in an entangled solution, polymer
chains overlap and entangle, constraining each other’s movement.57 The EC of BioPBS in DMSO/CHCl3 cosolvent
solutions was found to be approximately 7.5 (% w/v). The frequency
of beads amongst the fibers was calculated for BioPBS solutions ranging
from 5 to 15 (% w/v) concentration, where the beaded morphology was
present up until 15 (% w/v). The number of beads per 100 μm2 decreased with increasing BioPBS concentration, as shown
in Figure 6b. At significantly
lower viscosities, surface tension is the primary effect on the fiber
morphology, and below a critical concentration,58 electrosprayed drops form instead of electrospun fibers,
as shown in Figure 5a. Too high of a viscosity, and the polymer will not form fibers
at all, as jet formation is difficult at high viscosities.41

Physical and Mechanical Properties
Porosity
As previously
mentioned, porosity is a crucial
parameter for many biomedical applications and can be easily controlled
by adjusting the type and concentration of the polymer,59 solvent system,26 or humidity.27,59 The volatility of CHCl3 creates pores as the solvent evaporates.26 Areas with relatively a higher solvent content evaporate more rapidly
compared to the more homogeneous regions, resulting in voids or pores
forming along the fiber in these areas.26,27 Megelski et
al.26 investigated the effects of solvent
volatility on the porosity of the resulting fiber: they varied the
ratio of relatively volatile tetrahydrofuran (THF) with DMF, a less
volatile solvent. As the ratio of THF/DMF changed from 10:0 to 0:10,
the fiber morphology subsequently changed from highly porous in pure
THF, to less porous structures in 3:1 THF/DMF, to completely nonporous
fibers in pure DMF.26 Humidity was found
to have a similar effect on fiber porosity as solvent volatility:
as the relative humidity increased from 20 to 50%, the fiber morphology
changed from smooth nonporous fibers to highly porous fibers, respectively.26 In a humid environment, moisture can condense
on the relatively cold surface of a fiber, water vapor interacts with
the solvent, and as they both evaporate, a pore is formed.26 Porosity is also dependent on the polymer chosen
to electrospin. Wagner et al.59 showed
that with increasing fractions of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA)
in a PLLA:PHBV blend, that fiber porosity increased while the bead
formation decreased.

Porosity was found to increase while pore
size was found to decrease with increases in BioPBS concentration,
as shown in Table 3. Pores were observed regardless of the solvent system or grade of
BioPBS selected. However, FO-5 solutions did not have any pores along
the surface, likely because of the disproportionately high surface
tension compared to viscosity. In solutions with significantly low
viscosity, solvent molecules agglomerate together due to the influence
of surface tension.60 Furthermore, elongated
pores (43–67% roundness) formed with the long axis of the pores
aligned with the direction of the fiber, as shown in Figure 7a. This orientation was likely
due to the elongation forces present during the electrospinning process.
Electrospinning took place in humidity as high as 65% using a known
volatile solvent.26 It is likely that a
combination of high humidity and volatility contributed to the formation
of pores on the surface of the fibers, although it is unclear which
had a more significant effect on fiber porosity. Solution properties
and ambient conditions, specifically humidity, have a considerable
influence on pore size and porosity of electrospun fibers.

Tensile Strength
Similar to porosity,
BioPBS concentration
has a large effect on the subsequent mechanical properties of the
BioPBS nonwoven fibrous mats. Adjusting the BioPBS concentration results
in prominent changes in morphology, such as frequency of defects,
fiber diameter, and fiber porosity.34,53,59 These nano- and microsized morphological changes
affect the mechanical properties of the macrostructure, the nonwoven
fibrous mat. Tensile properties of the BioPBS nonwoven mat such as
tensile strength and Young’s modulus were found to increase
with increasing concentrations. As BioPBS concentration increased,
the frequency of beads along the fibers decreased (Figure 6b). The reduction of these
defects resulted in an increase in tensile properties (Figure 6a). Beaded electrospun fibers
can find applications in air filtration, where uniform diameters,
narrow diameter distributions, and strength are less crucial,61 as increased bead size and frequency contribute
to low pressure drops and increased filtration efficiency.61

Vautard et al.32 used three different techniques to induce surface defects on PAN-based
carbon fibers; concluding that the frequency of defects predominately
determined the fiber’s strength. An increase in the frequency
of defects results in a decrease in the fiber strength.32 In this study, beaded fibers acted as defects
within the nonwoven fibrous mat. A decrease in the frequency of beads
resulted in an increase in tensile properties. It is also well known
that an increase in porosity is linearly associated with a decrease
in the Young’s modulus of that material.62 However, it was found that the presence of bead defects
predominately affected the mechanical properties, irrespective of
porosity. The tensile values reported in this study are within the
range of those reported for the skin (1–20 MPa) or cardiac
tissue (0.3–0.8 MPa) but are far too weak for structural tissues
such as bones, tendons, or ligaments (50–100 MPa).11,63,64 It is recommended that further
tensile testing should be conducted at 37 °C in simulated bodily
fluid to get a better understanding of how these fibers would perform
within a human body.

Process Parameters
Voltage
The effect
voltage has on morphology is still
controversial among researchers.34 With
increasing voltage, researchers have observed smaller fibers,26,29,65 larger fibers,66,67 or observed negligible effects on morphology.68 The rationale for how an increase in voltage results in
smaller diameter is as follows: an increased voltage exposes the polymer
jet to a greater electric field. This increases the elongation forces
applied to the polymer because of higher Coulombic charges on the
surface of the polymer.69 Mo et al.65 found that increasing the voltage from 9 to
15 kV resulted in a small decrease in fiber diameter, from roughly
0.75 to 0.5 μm. The polymer concentration was found to have
a much greater effect on fiber diameter, a small change in concentration
(7–9 w/v %) resulted in an increase in the fiber diameter from
0.8 to 1.5 μm, respectively.65 Lee
et al.29 observed a similarly small reduction
in fiber diameter, where the fiber diameter decreased from approximately
325 to 260 nm when the voltage was increased from 10 to 25 kV.

Conversely, a higher applied voltage could result in larger fibers
because a higher build-up of charge at the needle causes the polymer
jet to accelerate faster, resulting in more solution being ejected
from the needle.60 Greater amounts of the
polymer in the electrospinning jet results in a larger fiber.66 Zhao et al.67 showed
that a smaller voltage reduces the acceleration of the jet due to
a weaker electric field, thereby increasing the amount of time the
fiber is exposed to the electric field before reaching the collector,
resulting in a thinner fiber. This suggests that a voltage approaching
the minimum critical voltage could be effective at producing thin
fibers. Furthermore, increasing the voltage, and hence the electric
field, creates a larger charge being formed at the tip that can create
droplets or beads.34 Bead formation could
be due to the increased instability of the jets as the Taylor cone
disappears.37 Voltage was found to have
a smaller effect in fiber morphology when compared to other variables
such as concentration, choice of solvents,35,46 and distance to the collector.35,68 The results
shown in Figure 8a–c
suggest that with increasing voltage, both fiber diameter and diameter
distribution increase. Smaller diameter fibers and distributions are
observed in electrospun fibers at 15 kV, while at 22.5 and 30 kV,
larger diameter fibers and distributions are observed. Such large
distributions observed in both 22.5 and 30 kV suggest that a voltage
close to the critical voltage should be used to produce smaller fibers
with a narrower distribution. These results are in accordance with
the results presented by Demir et al.66 and Zhao et al.67 and strengthens the
rationale that increasing the applied voltage will increase the diameter
of the resultant fibers.66,67

of 2000×) and corresponding histograms

gap: (a) 15 kV 1.5 mL/h, (b) 22.5 kV 3.0 mL/h, (c) 30 kV 4.5 mL/h;
15 kV 1.5 mL/h (d) 20 cm, (e) 25 cm, (f) 30 cm.

Distance between Electrodes
Varying the distance between
the electrodes, the EG alters the time the fiber is exposed to the
electric field between the electrodes. Shortening the EG increases
the electric field gradient and the jet’s acceleration, hence
reducing the time available for evaporation. Lengthening the distance
generally results in thinner fibers.34,70 SEM images
and the corresponding histograms (Figure 8d–f) show a clear left shift toward
smaller diameter fibers. Buchko et al.38 showed that when the EG was sufficiently small, an interconnected
fibrous mesh formed on the collector because of the inability to remove
the solvent in time. A larger EG, thus a longer period for the solvent
to evaporate, allows the fiber to continue to elongate before solidifying.
Conversely, too large a distance will create beaded fibers.34 Fiber diameter and jet current both decrease
with increasing EG; this is because the flight time is increased,
allowing more time for elongation, resulting in thinner fibers.39,67 The collector is commonly made from a conductive material and is
grounded to form a stable electric field. Nonconducting materials
result in a lower packing density.34 However,
in some cases, like three-dimensional nanofibrous scaffolds, it is
advantageous to allow the fibers to amass in a lower packing density,
resulting in a more porous material.11 To
this end, the EG of the electrospinning process must be optimized
in terms of morphology with careful consideration given to the interaction
effects between EG, flow rate, and the solvent used.

Conclusions
In this study, solution properties such as BioPBS concentration,
type of the solvent system, and grade of BioPBS had a greater effect
on the fiber morphology than process parameters, specifically the
applied voltage and the distance between electrodes. The best cosolvent
systems were found to be 10% DMSO/CHCl3 and 10% DMF/CHCl3. DMSO/CHCl3 cosolvent systems produced fibers
with less bead defects compared to DMF/CHCl3, regardless
of the BioPBS grade used. It was found that increasing BioPBS concentration
yielded fibers with fewer bead defects, which at 15 (% w/v) resulted
in bead-free uniform fibers. Furthermore, increasing the BioPBS concentration
was found to increase the porosity of the fibers while simultaneously
reducing its pore size. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the
reduction of bead defects resulted in a stronger nonwoven fibrous
mat. It was determined that electrospun BioPBS fibrous nonwoven mats
possess a high degree of porosity at the micro- and nanoscales, resulting
in a hierarchical structure that has sufficient mechanical properties
for applications in wound healing and soft tissue engineering. It
is suggested that further investigation into biocompatibility, biodegradability,
and mechanical properties under in vitro conditions be done in order
to better predict the fiber’s performance in environments that
more closely mimic those found within the human body.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Two grades (film and injection) of BioPBS,
product of PTT MCC BIOCHEM CO., Ltd., Thailand, were obtained from
Competitive Green Technologies, Leamington, Canada. The film grade
(PBS FZ91PM) had a MFI of 5 g/10 min (at 190 °C at 2.16 kg) and
the injection grade (PBS FZ71PM) had a MFI of 22 g/10 min under the
same conditions.50 Analytical grade chloroform,
DMSO, and DMF were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

Solution Preparation and Characterization
Film grade
BioPBS was dissolved in single solvent CHCl3 systems and
cosolvent systems with DMSO and DMF, labeled FC, FO, and FF, respectively.
Similarly, injection grade BioPBS was dissolved in the same solvent
systems and labeled IC, IO, and IF, respectively. The BioPBS concentration
was fixed at 15% (w/v) for initial solvent testing. The ratio of DMSO/CHCl3 and DMF/CHCl3 was varied from 10 to 50% (v/v).
BioPBS was dissolved in all solvent systems at 50 °C under vigorous
stirring. Single solvent systems were mixed for 2.5 h to ensure complete
dissolution. Co-solvent systems required BioPBS to be first dissolved
in CHCl3 for 2 h; then either DMSO or DMF was added dropwise
and continually stirred for an additional 0.5 h. FO solutions were
prepared with BioPBS concentrations of 5, 10, and 15% (w/v), labeled
FO-5, FO-10, and FO-15, respectively. Solutions were cooled to room
temperature prior to characterization and electrospinning. The solution’s
complex viscosity was measured using a MCR 302 rheometer (ANTON PARR,
Austria) using a shear rate sweep from 100 to 0.01 s–1 at 23 °C. Interfacial surface tension between the prepared
solutions and water was measured using the Wilhelmy plate method in
a KSV NIMA Langmuir–Blodgett trough (Biolin Scientific, Sweden).
Solution conductivity was measured using an accumet AP85 pH/conductivity
meter (Fisher Scientific); the conductivity meter was not sensitive
enough to measure pure CHCl3 (1.0 × 10–10 μS/cm).43 Because of the volatility
of CHCl3, the surface tension was measured with a capping
layer of deionized water to prevent evaporation; hence the reported
interfacial surface tension reflects the surface tension between the
prepared solution and deionized water.

Electrospinning of BioPBS
Fibers
Electrospinning was
conducted using a NANON-01A electrospinning setup (MECC CO., Ltd.,
Japan). Initial solvent testing was conducted using a solution of
15% (w/v) BioPBS concentration, 15 kV applied voltage, 1.5 mL/h flow
rate, 20 cm EG, and 18 gauge blunt tipped needle, under ambient conditions
(19–21 °C, 55–65% relative humidity). A custom-made
adjustable, flat collector plate was used to achieve a greater EG.
Polymer solutions were drawn into a 10 mL glass syringe, where 0.5
mL of each solution was electrospun to determine the fiber morphology.
Two microliters of each solution was used to create a fibrous nonwoven
sheet used for tensile testing. Electrospinning time varied depending
on the cleaning frequency. To maintain a stable Taylor cone, the flow
rate was raised proportionately with increasing applied voltage. Electrospun
samples were dried at room temperature under a vacuum overnight before
subsequent characterization.

Morphology and Structural Characterization
Morphology,
specifically fiber diameter, diameter distribution, pore size, and
porosity were observed using a Phenom ProX SEM (Phenom-World, The
Netherlands) with a 10 kV acceleration voltage. Prior to imaging,
samples were gold sputter-coated for 5 s using a 108 manual sputter
coater (TED PELLA, Inc). The presence of beads, fiber diameter, and
diameter distribution was observed at 600× and 2000× magnification,
respectively, while the pore size analysis was conducted at 25 000×
magnification. Further analysis was conducted using DiameterJ, a plugin
of ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), where a minimum
of two images were taken from random locations and used to calculate
both fiber and pore size distributions. Traditional, statistical region
merging and mixed segmentation were used to produce the most accurately
segmented image.

Tensile strength and Young’s modulus
of fibrous nonwoven mats were measured using Q800 DMA (TA Instruments).
Rectangular, nonwoven fibrous mats with average dimensions of 15,
5, 0.15 mm (length, width, thickness) were loaded into the DMA using
tension film clamps. An isothermal stress–strain, displacement
ramp test was conducted at 23 °C, with a 0.001 N preload, 0.1%
initial strain, and a 1 mm/min ramp rate.
