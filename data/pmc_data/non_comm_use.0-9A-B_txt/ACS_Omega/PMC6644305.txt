Here,
we present the low-temperature (∼600 °C) solution combustion method for the fabrication
of CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and
Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles
(NPs) of 12–64 nm range in pure cubic spinel structure, by
adjusting the oxidant (nitrate ions)/reductant (glycine) ratio in
the reaction mixture. Although nitrate ions/glycine (N/G) ratios of
3 and 6 were used for the synthesis, phase-pure NPs could be obtained
only for the N/G ratio of 6. For the N/G ratio 3, certain amount of
Ni2+ cations was reduced to metallic nickel. The NH3 gas generated during the thermal decomposition of the amino
acid (glycine, H2NCH2COOH) induced the reduction
reaction. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, vibrating sample
magnetometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques were
utilized to characterize the synthesized materials. XRD analyses of
the samples indicate that the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs have lattice parameter larger than that
of NiFe2O4, but smaller than that of CoFe2O4 NPs. Although the saturation magnetization (Ms) of Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs lies in between the saturation magnetization
values of CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 NPs, high coercivity (Hc, 875
Oe) of the NPs indicate their hard ferromagnetic behavior. Catalytic
behavior of the fabricated spinel NPs revealed that the samples containing
metallic Ni are active catalysts for the degradation of 4-nitrophenol
in aqueous medium.

1 Introduction
Magnetic
nanomaterials are of immense current scientific and technological
interest. Although magnetic nanostructures of spinel and rhombohedral
perovskite types have shown a great promise to study their unusual
magnetic behaviors and associated technological applications, such
as high density data storage, memory devices/read-out head,1−4 they have been routinely applied in the purification of wastewater,5 bactericide, and organic dye degradation.6,7 CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 are
interesting ferrimagnetic materials with inverse spinel structure.3 The reported magnetization values of CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles
(NPs) at 50 000 Oe are generally higher than 60 and 40 emu/g,
respectively.3,8 Nickel ferrite is a soft magnetic
material with high electrical resistivity; useful for high-frequency
applications, such as transformer cores.9 The ability to control magnetic properties, such as saturation magnetization,
remanent magnetization, and coercivity of these ferrite nanostructures,
is important not only for the fundamental understanding of magnetism
in these important materials but also for their applications as magnetic
resonance imaging contrast-enhancement agents and in magnetic hyperthermia
for biomedical therapeutic purposes.10

On the other hand, NiFe2O4 NPs have been
utilized in selective oxidation of thiols to produce disulfides (in
presence of hydrogen peroxide),11 cyanation
of aryl and heteroaryl halides,12 reduction
of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in presence of NaBH4,13 and gas sensing.14−16 Most of these applications
of NiFe2O4 NPs are driven by their surface properties,
such as presence of (i) metal hydroxides, (ii) remanant organic ligand,
and (iii) adsorbed small organic molecules at their surfaces. Therefore,
designing and fabricating NiFe2O4 NPs with tailored
surface functionalities are of immense importance for their catalytic
applications.17,18 NiFe2O4 NPs are also the potential candidates for magnetic separation of
gases (i.e., separation of O2 from air).19 O2 is a paramagnetic gas, with relatively high
magnetic susceptibility (χ), and can be attracted with magnetizing
force produced by the gradient magnetic field. On the other hand,
N2 is diamagnetic gas with low χ.20

For the synthesis of metal ferrite nanoparticles,
organic solvents,21 surfactants,21,22 organometallic
compounds,8 and other organic molecules
are often used to control their size and shape.3,22,23 However, the magnetic properties, such as
coercivity (Hc) and saturation magnetization
(Ms), of these nanostructures get affected
if those organic molecules are not completely removed from the surface
of the nanostructures.24 On the other hand,
presence of organic molecules at the surface of these nanostructures
modifies their catalytic behavior.24 Common
synthesis methods used to fabricate ferrites nanostructures are sol–gel
(using citric acid),25 solvothermal (using
ethyleneglycol, sodium acetate, and poly(ethylene glycol)),3 co-precipitation,16 and solid-state reaction.26 Manikandan
et al. have reported the synthesis of various ferrite nanoparticles
by the microwave combustion method using urea as the fuel.27 On the other hand, Raju et al.28 utilized citric acid for the sol–gel syntheses of
CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles,
utilizing citrate ions as fuel and as the coordinating agent with
metal ions to assist the product formation. A ligand- or surfactant-free
aqueous synthesis process generates nanoparticles of organic species-free
surfaces, ready for catalysis and sensing.29 Solution combustion is a method that allows the synthesis of nanoscale
materials through mixing metal salts, a fuel (urea, glycine, citric
acid, etc.) and an oxidizing agent (HNO3, NO3– ions of the precursor salts, etc.), and a solvent
followed by a self-sustained combustion along with a redox reaction.30 This method usually uses water as solvent, frequently
obtaining phase-pure ferrites under optimum experimental conditions.
In solution combustion process, organic materials utilized or generated
during reaction process are eliminated through high-temperature reactions
(including redox reactions) and/or postgrowth thermal annealing under
oxygen-rich ambient.

CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles of unspecified sizes or in bulk
form have been fabricated
earlier by solution combustion and other methods performing firing
at temperatures in between 900 and 1200 °C.16,26,31 However, high-temperature firing and prolonged
annealing produce ferrite nanoparticles of bigger sizes due to temperature-induced
growth. To fabricate ferrite nanoparticles of smaller sizes, a low-temperature
chemical process or solution combustion at lower firing temperature
along with a shorter postgrowth annealing is desirable.

CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 grow in spinel-type
crystal structures, which can be represented
by (Fe3+)[Co2+Fe3+]O4 and
(Fe3+)[Ni2+Fe3+]O4, respectively.
The cations inside the round brackets are in tetrahedral (A) sites,
and the cations inside square brackets are in octahedral (B) sites.
The distribution of cations in the crystal lattice depends on several
factors, such as the method of preparation, chemical composition,
and sintering temperature.15,28 The distribution of
the cations at tetrahedral and octahedral sites modifies the properties
of the ferrites. The net magnetization in CoFe2O4 (or NiFe2O4) is the difference in the magnetizations
of these two (A) and (B) sublattices.28 As the magnetic contribution of Fe3+ cations at (A) sites
cancels out the magnetization provided by Fe3+ cations
at (B) sites, the net magnetization of mixed ferrites, such as CoxNi1–xFe2O3, is governed only by the unpaired spins of the
Co2+ and Ni2+ cations. The number of unpaired
spins in the Co2+ cation is 3, whereas for the Ni2+ cations it is 2. Incorporation of Co2+ in NiFe2O4 produces mixed ferrite CoxNi1–xFe2O4 with both Co2+ and Ni2+ cations in octahedral
(B) sites, producing a small change in the cell parameter of the cubic
spinel NiFe2O4. On the other hand, incorporation
of cobalt (Co) in NiFe2O4 induces increments
in (i) the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (and consequently the magnetization)
and (ii) the coercivity (Hc) enhancing
its application potential in magnetic recording.

A substantial
research effort has been devoted by the researchers
to fabricate Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs and their composites.32,33 For example, Chitra
et al. intended to prepare a polyaniline–Ni0.4Co0.6Fe2O4 nanocomposite by in situ chemical
polymerization under ultrasonication, using ferrites NPs prefabricated
through a urea-assisted solution combustion process.34 However, a considerable amount of α-Fe2O3 byproduct was formed, as evidenced in their X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns.34 On the other hand, Maaz
et al.35 attempted to synthesize Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs through
co-precipitation, obtaining a mixture of Ni- and Co–ferrite,
rather than a single homogeneous phase. Magnetic hysteresis loops
of the sample with bee-waist type behavior clearly demonstrate the
presence of individual ferrite phases.35 In fact, reports on the fabrication of stoichiometric Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs in pure spinel phase
have been scarce in the literature. Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs have been fabricated through co-precipitation
at solution pH 13, with further annealing at 900 °C for 10 h.36 Poly(vinyl alcohol)-assisted sol–gel
method has also been used to fabricate Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs. However, the quality of those NPs
could not be guessed as their morphological and spectroscopic results
were not reported.37 Therefore, a betterment
of conventional methods or implementation of a new technique for the
synthesis of stoichiometric, phase-pure spinel ferrites in large scale
is of immense current scientific and technological interest.

Although the magnetic properties of spinel cobalt and nickel ferrites
have been studied by several research groups,3,8,13,24,21,38,39 there exist very few reports in the literature on the magnetic properties
of Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs,
especially beyond room temperature.28,36 Furthermore,
although Rosnan et al. reported a coercivity field (Hc) of 603.26 Oe for their Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs fabricated by co-precipitation and
postgrowth sintering at 900 °C for 10 h,36 Raju et al. reported a Hc value of just
250 Oe for their Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs fabricated by the citrate mediated sol–gel method.
As the Hc value is a critical parameter
for possible magnetic applications of this ferrite, it is worth to
synthesize and study the magnetic properties of Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs in comparison with phase-pure
spinel CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 NPs fabricated under identical synthesis conditions.

In this
article, we present the fabrication of phase pure, stoichiometric,
spinel CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs through low-temperature solution combustion process, establishing
the role of each of the reagents on the size control of spinel NPs.
Effects of Ni incorporation on the magnetic behaviors of the spinel
ferrites have been studied over 1.8–350 K. Effects of phase
purity and stoichiometry on the catalytic behavior of the metal ferrites
have been studied by evaluating their reduction efficiency of 4-nitrophenol,
a common organic contaminant in wastewater.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Formation of Ferrites in
Solution Combustion
Process
The reactions that occur on dissolving glycine in
water, together with the stability constant (β) in each step40 are presented in Scheme 1. The nitric acid added to the aqueous solution
induces the protonation of the amine group of the glycinate ligand
(also protonation of carboxylate group at pH < 2.44) and shifts
the reaction equilibrium to the right. Therefore, the protonation
process hampers the bonding of glycinate anion with the Ni(II) cation.
It is well known that the glycine forms complexes with transition-metal
cations in aqueous solutions.40 In the
presence of hexaaqua complex of nickel(II), the carboxylate group
of the glycine first makes a coordinated chemical bond with hexahydrated
Ni(II) cation. The ratio between the molar concentrations of the products
and the reactants (each concentration must be elevated to its corresponding
stoichiometric coefficient) is expressed by the parameter β.
For example, β for the second chemical reaction in Scheme 1 can be estimated
utilizing the eq 1. The
logarithm of the stability constant (β1) for this
reaction is 6.16.40 The Gibbs energy change
for the formation of the Ni–glycinate complex is ΔG° = −RT ln β,
where R = 8.314 J K–1 mol–1 and T is the temperature in K.
ΔG° = −(8.314 J K–1 mol–1) × (298 K) × (14.18) = −35.1
kJ per mole of Ni–glycinate complex.

Scheme 1 Stability Constant
(β) for the Protonation of the Glycinate
Anion Dissolved in Water and Complexation between this Anion with
a Nickel(II) Cation in Water
If enough amount of glycine is present in the solution,
a second
glycinate anion can be bonded to Ni–glycinate complex, generating
the [Ni(H3NCH2COO)2(H2O)4] complex, for which the logarithm of the stability
constant (β2) is 11.11 (see the third reaction in Scheme 1).40 If the Ni(II) cations in Scheme 1 are replaced by Co(II) cations, the logarithms
of β1 and β2 change to 5.10 and
9.10, respectively (see Table 3.4 in ref (40)). ΔG° for the Co(II)–glycinate
complex is −(8.314 J K–1 mol–1) × (298 K) × (11.74) = −29.1 kJ/mol. In the chemical
equilibria shown in Scheme 1, the higher the value of log β, the higher the
shift of the equilibrium to the right. Similar compounds can also
be formed between glycine anions and hydrated Fe(III) cations. As
the values of log(β1) and log(β2) are higher for Ni(II)–glycinate complex, in the reactions
involving both Ni(II) and Co(II) ions, the glycinate anions form stronger
bonding with Ni(II) ions than with Co(II) cations. 1  Scheme 2 depicts the chelation process between glycine
and a Ni(II)
cation proposed by Jordan.41 Although the
electronic structure of the glycinate ligand changes once the carboxylate
group (COO–) bonds to the Ni(II) cation, it is difficult
for the protonated amine group of the glycinate anion to form bond
with the same Ni(II) cation because of low pH used in this work.

Scheme 2 Complexation between Glycinate Anions and a Ni(II) Cation in Water
The scheme is adapted from the
Scheme 3.10 of ref (41).

2.2 X-ray Diffraction
Figure 1 presents
the XRD patterns
of the samples synthesized at nitrate ions/glycine (N/G) ratio of
3. As can be noticed, although CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 ferrites were formed, metallic nickel and α-Fe2O3 byproducts were formed in the samples. Although
the formation of metallic nickel in the samples containing Ni precursor
is due to the reduction of Ni2+ cations by glycine, the
formation of α-Fe2O3 in all of the samples
occurred probably due to the presence of excess iron atoms in the
reaction mixture, which did not participate in the formation of NiFe2O4. The excess of iron atom in the reaction mixture
occurs due to the consumption of a fraction of Ni ions to form metallic
nickel. Likewise, a very small fraction of cobalt atoms could also
be consumed to form metallic cobalt in the mixed oxide, undetected
by XRD.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the (a) CoFe2O4-3, (b) NiFe2O4-3, and (c) Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-3 samples. The diffraction peaks marked with
the diamond symbol coincide with the reflections of α-Fe2O3 (PDF #04-006-6579). Likewise, the peaks indicated
with the filled circles coincide with standard reflections of metallic
nickel in cubic phase (PDF #00-004-0850).

As evidenced by the XRD patterns presented in Figure 1, a certain amount of Ni2+ cations was also reduced to metallic nickel. As can be perceived
from the standard reduction potentials (E0) of Ni2+, Co2+, Fe3+ ions along
with nitrate ion and Ni(glycine)2 complex42 presented in eqs 2–7 of the Scheme 3, the Ni2+ cation is easier to reduce than Co2+ and Fe3+ cations. However, the presence of ligands
bonded to metal cations in aqueous media can significantly influence
the reduction potential of a metal–ion couple.43

Scheme 3 Selected Standard Reduction Potentials that May be
Involved in the
Formation of Byproduct during the Syntheses of Nickel and Cobalt Ferrites
It can also be noted the Ni(glycine)2 complex is harder
to be reduced to Ni(s) than Ni2+ cations. Moreover, according
to the Le Châtelier’s principle, addition of higher
amount of nitric acid in the reaction mixture will induce protonation
of more glycine molecules (see Scheme 1). As the protonated glycine [H3NCH2COOH]+ is unable to bond with Ni2+ cations,
the reaction 6 in Scheme 3 does not occur. Consequently, the Ni2+ cations
are available to be reduced, as shown in reaction 2. If a fraction
of the Ni2+ cations is reduced to nickel, or a fraction
of Co2+ cations is reduced to cobalt, the excess Fe3+ cations in the reaction mixture will form α-Fe2O3. The process of reduction of Ni2+ cations by glycine has been discussed in details in the next paragraphs.According
to Li et al.,44 during the decomposition
of glycine at 282 °C, ammonia (NH3) molecules are
formed through a deamination reaction. At 400 °C, the main decomposition
products of glycine are HNCO, HCN, and CO. NH3 is a reducing
agent, in which the oxidation state of nitrogen is −3. A thermal
decomposition of Ni(NH3)2(H2NCH3COO)2 complex generates Ni and NiO nanoparticles.45 Although the formation of diamminediglycinatenickel(II)
complexes, such as Ni(NH3)2(H2NCH2COO)2, under the reaction conditions used in the
present work is quite possible, formation of metallic Ni due to the
reduction of Ni2+ ion by NH3 is evident in the
XRD patterns presented in Figure 1. An alternative pathway for the formation of metallic
Ni in glycine-mediated solution combustion process has also been proposed
by Varma et al.,30 where they assumed the
formation of NiO first and then its reduction by NH3. However,
they did not provide the details of involved reactions.

On the
other hand, thermal decomposition of hydrated M(NO3)2 or M(NO3)3 (M = Co, Ni, and Fe)
and HNO3 generates a mixture of NO2, N2O4, and N2O5 gases. These NOx gases ignite when they get in contact with
NH3 and/or HNCO gases (a hypergolic mixture of gases),
generating colorful flame during the ignition,46 as has been observed for the samples prepared at N/G ratio
3 (see Experimental Section). Higher the amount
of glycine in the reaction mixture, higher is the amount of NH3 or HNCO gas available to produce this flame. Since red-brown
gases associated to N2O4 (a dimer of NO2) were not released at the end of the combustion reaction,
we can assume that the glycine used in the reaction mixtures completely
reduced the NO3– ions to colorless N2 or NO gas. Use of higher amount of glycine in the reaction
mixture produces higher amounts of NH3 or HNCO gas, generating
bigger flames during the ignition process. It is worth mentioning
that in many cases, when NH3 molecules are adsorbed on
Brønsted acid sites, NH3 can reduce the toxic NOx gases to N2.45 In addition, the exothermic reaction between NH3 and HNO3 (an oxidizing agent) acts as the source of energy
required to achieve the self-sustained reaction regime. Such self-sustained
reactions were observed to occur in the solution combustion process
on utilizing nitrate ions/glycine ratio 3.

To reduce the formation
of NH3 through decomposition
of glycine, and consequently to avoid the formation of metallic nickel,
the oxidant-agent/reducing-agent (i.e., the N/G) ratio was increased
from 3 to 6.

In Figure 2, XRD
patterns of the CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 samples synthesized with N/G ratio 6 are presented.
As can be seen in Figure 2 (pattern a), all of the diffraction peaks revealed in the
diffraction pattern of CoFe2O4 sample match
perfectly to the standard diffraction pattern (position and intensity)
of spinel CoFe2O4 (PDF #04-006-4147). Formation
of phase-pure NiFe2O4 spinel nanostructures
is also confirmed as the revealed diffraction peaks match both in
intensity and in position of peaks in their standard diffraction pattern
(PDF #54-0964) (Figure 2, pattern b). Finally, the diffraction pattern of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 sample (Figure 2, pattern c) confirmed the
obtention of the ferrite with spinel structure. Apart from the position
and intensity matching with standard diffraction pattern, symmetrical
shape of all of the diffraction peaks confirms that the ferrite is
in single spinel phase. There appeared no additional peak associated
to metallic or undesired oxide phase in the diffraction patterns of
the samples. However, as can be seen in the right panel of Figure 2, the zoomed-in XRD
patterns of all three samples in the 52–65° range, the
diffraction peaks of NiFe2O4 are slightly shifted
to higher 2θ values compared with the diffraction peaks of CoFe2O4. Such a peak shift is very much expected, as
the Shannon ionic radius of Ni2+ cation (0.55 Å) is
slightly smaller than that of Co2+ cation (0.58 Å).47 On the other hand, the diffractogram of the
Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 sample
revealed peaks centered around 53.75, 57.31, and 62.89°, which
are in between the corresponding peak positions of the CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 samples, indicating
the formation of Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 phase.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of the (a) CoFe2O4-6,
(b) NiFe2O4-6, and (c) Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6 samples. The same diffractograms
zoomed in
from 2θ = 52 to 65° are presented in the right panel to
show the peak shift with composition variation.

The reported lattice parameters for cubic CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 are 8.376 Å
(PDF #4-006-4147)
and 8.337 Å (PDF #54-0964), respectively. However, for Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4, there exist
two reported standard lattice parameters: a = 8.3614
Å (PDF #01-083-6066) and a = 8.3468 Å (PDF
#00-066-0246).28,48 These two lattice parameters
differ only by 0.0146 Å. The lattice parameters estimated using
the (511) and (440) peaks located at 2θ = 57.313 and 62.891°
were 8.3465 and 8.3529 Å, respectively, both of which are close
to the value reported in the PDF #00-066-0246.

The average crystallite
sizes in the CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 samples estimated using the Scherrer
equation were 52, 25, and 38 nm, respectively, which are in agreement
with the peak broadening, evident in the right panel of Figure 2. Therefore, it can be concluded
that the N/G ratio in the reaction mixture must be higher than 3 to
avoid the formation of metallic nickel and α-Fe2O3 byproducts in solution combustion process. As we obtained
phase-pure ferrites for N/G ratio 6, the experimental results and
associated discussions presented hereafter are only for the samples
prepared with N/G ratio of 6.

2.3 Raman
Spectroscopy
Figure 3 presents the room-temperature
Raman spectra of the spinel ferrite nanostructures. As can be noticed,
all of the samples revealed sharp and intense Raman bands indicating
their high crystallinity. The Raman spectrum of CoFe2O4 NPs (Figure 3, trace a) revealed two well-defined intense bands around 473 and
693 cm–1 and four lesser intense bands around 207,
307, 570, and 615 cm–1. Although the higher energy
bands at 615 and 693 cm–1 correspond to the fundamental
Ag modes, involving symmetric stretching of oxygen atom
with respect to metal–ion in tetrahedral void, frequently observed
in crystalline spinel CoFe2O4 nanostructures,49 the bands appeared around 207, 307, 473, and
570 cm–1 are due to the symmetric and antisymmetric
bending of oxygen atom in M–O bond at octahedral voids, corresponding
to the T2g(1), Eg, T2g(2), and T2g(3) modes.49 Cation redistribution in the tetrahedral and
octahedral sites in CoFe2O4 alters the symmetry
of the crystal structure from Fd3̅m to I41/amd space group and increases the number of active vibrational
modes in Raman spectrum from 5 to 10.49 That might be the reason for appearing two Ag modes in
the Raman spectrum of our CoFe2O4 NPs (Figure 3a).

Figure 3 Raman spectra of the
CoFe2O4-6, NiFe2O4-6,
and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6
samples.

On the other hand, the Raman spectrum
of NiFe2O4 sample revealed eight dispersion
bands located around 211,
335, 450, 487, 567, 596, 659, and 703 cm–1. The
band at 703 cm–1 corresponds to the symmetric stretching
of oxygen atom with respect to metal–ion in tetrahedral void
of spinel NiFe2O4 lattice. The bands at 211,
335, 487, and 596 cm–1 are due to the symmetric
and antisymmetric bending of oxygen atom in M–O bond at octahedral
voids. Finally, the bands appeared around 450, 567, and 659 cm–1 as the shoulders of the intense 487 and 703 Raman
bands appeared due to the differences in charge and ionic radii of
Ni and Fe ions, producing larger Ni(II)–O bonds in comparison
to Fe(III)–O bond,21 and consequently
changing the energy of their bending and stretching vibrations. However,
although a same number of dispersion bands appeared in the Raman spectrum
of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 sample (Figure 3,
trace c), their positions remained in between the positions of corresponding
modes in NiFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 samples. Although the T2g(2) mode is the most
intense Raman band in CoFe2O4 NPs, the Ag mode is the most intense band in NiFe2O4 NPs due to its fully symmetric nature. However, the T2g(2) and Ag modes appear with almost same intensity
in Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 due
to both nickel and cobalt cations are located at octahedral sites.

2.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Formation
of nanometer-sized quasi-spherical particles in the CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 samples is very clear
in the typical SEM images provided in Figure 4. A simple view of the micrographs can detect
the nanoparticles formed in NiFe2O4 sample are
quite smaller than the nanoparticles in CoFe2O4 sample, and the particles formed in Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 are of intermediate sizes. The sizes
of the particles in the CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 samples varied in between 22 and 64 (ca. average size
= 39 ± 10 nm), 12 and 42 (ca. average size = 26 ± 8 nm),
and 20 and 55 nm (ca. average size = 32 ± 7 nm), respectively.
The size variation observed for the samples is in good agreement with
their average crystallite sizes determined from XRD spectra (Section 2.2). The size
variation of the spinel nanoparticles can be explained considering
the stability constant β of the corresponding metal–glycinate
complexes. As has been discussed in Section 2.1, the stability constant of the complex
formed between the glycinate anion and the Ni(II) cations is larger
(β = 1.445 × 105) than that of the complex formed
between glycinate anion and Co(II) cations (β = 1.259 ×
105). On the other hand, the ΔG°
for these complexes are −35.1 and −29.1 kJ/mol. A more
negative ΔG° value of the complex indicates
a higher temperature, and longer annealing time is needed to decompose
the complex. Therefore, the NiFe2O4 NPs were
formed at considerably slower growth rate than the CoFe2O4 NPs at the annealing conditions (600 °C and 2
h) used in the present study. In fact, using annealing temperature
of 900 °C and 3 h annealing duration, Raju et al. reported to
obtain Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 particles of 100 nm average size, in solution combustion synthesis.28 The results indicate that the method used in
the present work is more convenient for obtaining smaller metal ferrite
nanoparticles. Finally, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
(Figure 4d–f)
spectra of the samples revealed only the emission peaks of their constituting
elements, with no other impurity. The Co/Fe, Ni/Fe, and Co/Ni/Fe atomic
ratios estimated by EDS analysis were 1:2, 1:2, and 0.5:0.5:2.0 for
(NiFe2O4), (CoFe2O4),
and (Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4),
respectively.

EDS spectra of the samples are presented in (d), (e), and (f), respectively.

CoFe2O4 and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs was black,
whereas the color of the NiFe2O4 NPs was brown.
These colors agree with the position of the absorption edges revealed
in the Kubelka–Munk plots of the absorption spectra of ferrite
nanostructures presented in Figure 5a. The absorption edge of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 is close to the absorption edge
of CoFe2O4, and although the former contains
Ni2+ cations, there appeared no absorption band near 754
nm in the absorption spectrum of Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 (Figure 5a). The bandgaps of the Co and Ni ferrites were estimated
through the Tauc’ plots (Figure 5b–d). Although the black CoFe2O4 and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 samples revealed direct bandgaps of 1.46 and 1.53 eV, respectively,
the brown NiFe2O4 revealed a direct bandgap
of 1.87 eV.

NPs and (b–d) their corresponding Tauc’ plots to determine
their bandgaps. (e) Sketch of the d orbitals in the ground and an

Theoretical band structures for CoFe2O4 and
NiFe2O4 were reported by Dileep et al.50 According to the density of states diagram of
CoFe2O4, the electron density at the Fermi level
is provided mainly by Co(II) cations in octahedral sites. Likewise,
the electron density at the Fermi level of NiFe2O4 is provided mainly by the Ni(II) cations in octahedral sites. Accordingly,
different bandgap values are expected for Co and Ni ferrites. From
their calculated band structure for CoFe2O4,
bandgap energies of 0.8 (X → Γ) and 1.6 eV (Γ →
Γ) were reported.50 As can be noticed,
the calculated energy of the Γ → Γ electronic transition
is close to the direct bandgap value (1.46 eV) we determined for CoFe2O4. On the other hand, bandgap energies of 2.0
(X → Γ) and 2.7 eV (Γ → Γ) were obtained
from the band structure for NiFe2O4, which are
considerably higher than the bandgap energy (1.87 eV) determined for
this ferrite in the present work.

There appeared a sharp absorption
band around 754 nm (13263 cm–1) in the absorption
spectrum of NiFe2O4 NPs. Although Liu et al.
have also observed the appearance
of 754 nm absorption band in the absorption spectrum of NiFe2O4, its origin was not discussed.52 Besides, in the electronic absorption spectrum of octahedral Ni(II)
complex, a band at 758 nm (13 200 cm–1) was
observed by Lancashire and associated to the 3T1g ← 3A2g electronic transition.53 Although the 3A2g electron
configuration of octahedral Ni(II) complexes designates a nondegenerate
state (in which each set of levels is symmetrically occupied), the 3T2g electron configuration designates a triply
degenerate asymmetrically occupied state (see Figure 5e).51 The superscript
3 indicates the spin multiplicity due to the two unpaired electrons
present in d8 cations, such as Ni(II). 3A2g and 3T1g are states representing the
ground and an excited energy levels between which an electronic transition
occurs both for octahedral Ni(II) complexes and small NiFe2O4 NPs (Figure 5a,e). This allowed electronic transition, which is also usually
represented in the Tanabe–Sugano diagram for cations with d8 electron configuration.51

2.6 Vibrating Sample Magnetometry
The
magnetization curves of the CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs recorded at different temperatures are presented
in Figure 6. It is
interesting to note that the hysteresis loops of CoFe2O4 NPs (Figure 6a) bear typical characteristics of hard ferrimagnetic material, whereas
the magnetization curves of NiFe2O4 NPs (Figure 6b) correspond to
very soft ferromagnetic material. The room-temperature coercive field
(Hc) of CoFe2O4 NPs
is about 1274 Oe, which increases up to 13 002 Oe at 10 K (Table 2). On the other hand,
the isostructural NiFe2O4 ferrite nanoparticles
revealed Hc values at 300 and 10 K of
only 158 and 422 Oe, respectively. This difference in the Hc value is due to the smaller anisotropy constant
(K1) for NiFe2O4. Reported K1 values for CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 are 0.27 and −0.0069
MJ/m3, respectively.54K1 is equal to the energy density necessary to
turn the magnetization from the easy to a hard magnetization axis.54 The simplest expression for the magnetrocrystalline
energy is Ea = K1V sin2 θ,
where V stands for the volume of the particle and
θ is the angle between the easy and hard magnetization axes.55 Since the NiFe2O4 NPs
have smaller size (∼26 ± 8 nm) and smaller K1 value than the CoFe2O4 NPs (∼39
± 10 nm), the Hc value for NiFe2O4 is considerably smaller than that for NiFe2O4.

Figure 6 (a, b, c) Magnetization vs applied magnetic field curves

10, 100, and 300 K for CoFe2O4-6, NiFe2O4-6, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6 NPs. (d, e, f). Zero field cooling (ZFC) and field-cooled
(FC) magnetization curves recorded under 200 Oe of applied magnetic
field and at 2 K/min for the NPs.

Estimated Hc values (Figure S1) and other magnetic parameters for
the CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 NPs are summarized
in Table 1 and compared
with some reported values (Table 2). Interestingly, Limaye et
al.24 achieved a huge increase in the Hc values up to 9470 Oe at room temperature by
capping their CoFe2O4 NPs with oleic acid. Such
an increase of Hc was attributed to the
cumulative effect of surface spin disorder, large strain, and surface
anisotropy of the particles due to oleic acid capping.24 On the other hand, NiFe2O4 NPs (10 nm) fabricated by Šepelák et al.56 through high-energy milling process exhibited
an Hc value of 2450 Oe (0.245 T) at 4
K. The high Hc value of their NiFe2O4 NPs was attributed to low degree of inversion
(λ = 0.72) of the cations on (A) and (B) sites in the spinel.
Although the Hc value estimated for bulk
NiFe2O4 was very low as all of the Ni2+ cations are located in (B) sites, causing a high degree of inversion
(λ = 1), the Hc of their ball-milled
NiFe2O4 NPs decreased substantially after air
annealing at 700 °C. Although NiFe2O4 NPs
of about 12 nm average size fabricated by prolonged (30 h) ball-milling
process were seen to have coercivity (Hc) around 78 Oe at room temperature,57 the
NiFe2O4 NPs of about 26 nm average size fabricated
in the present study revealed coercivity ∼159 Oe at room temperature.
Such a discrepancy in the Hc value of
the fabricated NiFe2O4 NPs might be associated
to presence of carboxylate groups at their surface, as has been demonstrated
from their X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Section 2.7).

was used as
a capping agent; sp = superparamagnetic; Ø: diameter.

When half of the Co2+ cations in CoFe2O4 is substituted by Ni2+ cations, the (Fe1.03+)[Ni0.52+Co0.52+Fe1.03+] ferrite is obtained (commonly
referred as Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4). In comparison to CoFe2O4 NPs, the Hc value of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs decreased by ∼31% (i.e., up
to 886 Oe) and 31.4% (i.e., up to 8962 Oe) at 300 and 10 K, respectively.
Obtained hysteresis loops of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs indicate their ferrimagnetic behavior. The
coercive field (Hc) of Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs was seen to depend
strongly on their sizes. Although room-temperature Hc values for Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs of 33 and 34 nm were reported to be 603 and 659
Oe, respectively (Table 2), the reported room-temperature Hc value
for larger (200–2000 nm size range) Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs was only 250 Oe.28 Higher Hc value
obtained in the present study could be due to the presence either
of (i) metal hydroxides, (ii) carboxylate groups, and (iii) cations
with dangling bonds or all of them at the surface of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs. In fact, due to
higher surface area of smaller spinel ferrite NPs in comparison to
bigger one, they have higher Hc values,
contributed by the earlier mentioned surface species. The presence
of metal hydroxides and the carboxylate groups at the surface of these
ferrites was confirmed through XPS, as discussed in Section 2.7.

The room-temperature
saturation magnetizations (Ms) of the
CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 were
only 52.63 and 30.21 emu/g (Figure 6a,b), respectively. The observed lower (∼43%)
magnetization value of the NiFe2O4 NPs at room
temperature is expected, as the number of unpaired spins in Ni2+ cation (two) is lower than the number of unpaired spins
in Co2+ cation (three). On the other hand, the room-temperature Ms of Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs was 43.56 emu/g, which is lower than the
value (57.12 emu/g) reported by Raju et al.28 for larger (200–2000 nm) Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 particles. A variation of room-temperature
magnetization with the variation of composition of the ferrite nanoparticles
can be seen in Figure 7. The squareness ratio (i.e., Mr/Ms) at 300 K for the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs was 0.36, which is close to the ratio
obtained for CoFe2O4 NPs (i.e., 0.40), but larger
than for NiFe2O4 NPs (i.e., 0.13), see Table 1. Since the magnetization
curves in Figure 6a,c
have a positive slope in between 2 and 4 T, a small paramagnetic contribution
is present in the three samples. The paramagnetic contributions in
the magnetization curves of the fabricated nanostructures might have
come from the cations present at the surface of the NPs.

Figure 7 Magnetization
vs applied magnetic field curves at 300 K for CoFe2O4-6, NiFe2O4-6, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6.

As can be seen from Figure 6d–f, the zero field cooling (ZFC) curves for
the CoFe2O4 and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs are of exponential shape, increasing
the magnetic
moment with temperature. However, in the case of NiFe2O4 NPs, the magnetic moment increases almost linearly with temperature
in 1.8–220 K range and then increases rather steeply in between
250 and 350 °C, following a quasi-linear behavior. In ZFC scans,
a sample is cooled down under zero applied magnetic field. Consequently,
at low temperature the net magnetic moment of the sample is low due
to random alignment of spins. However, when the sample’s temperature
is progressively increased, thermal fluctuation of the sample unblocks
the frozen spins. These unblocked spins get aligned along the applied
magnetic field (200 Oe in the present case) increasing the net magnetic
moment of the sample (Figure 6d–f). However, neither of the synthesized samples revealed
well-defined ZFC maximum, which could be considered as blocking temperature
(TB). Although blocking temperatures of
about 350 and 400 K have been reported for CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 NPs of about 12 and 11 nm average
sizes, respectively, in the literature,13,58 the TB values for the metal ferrite nanoparticles
fabricated in the present study were not possible as they remain above
350 K (beyond the measured temperature range).

On the other
hand, the FC curve for the NiFe2O4 sample revealed
a slight decrease in net magnetic moment with the
increase of temperature, indicating the alignment of a small fraction
of spins under the applied magnetic field (200 Oe) due to a progressive
increase in thermal energy (kBT). This
behavior was not observed for the CoFe2O4 and
Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 samples,
probably due to their higher anisotropy constants (K1) for the cobalt ferrite. The irreversibility temperature, Tirr (the temperature at which the ZFC and FC
curves of a material get separated), for all of the three ferrites
was higher than 350 K, although a Tirr of ∼40 K has been reported for NiFe2O4 by Nathani et al.39

2.7 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
A typical XPS
survey spectrum of the CoFe2O4 sample is depicted
in Figure 8a. As expected,
only the emissions correspond to cobalt, iron,
oxygen, and carbon are revealed in the XPS spectrum. High-resolution
XPS spectra for selected atomic orbitals of Co, Fe, C, and O are depicted
in Figure 8b–e.
The deconvolution of the asymmetric peak associated to the Co 2p3/2 orbital in the CoFe2O4 sample generated
three component peaks at 779.9, 781.9, and 783.9 eV and its corresponding
three shake-up peaks (Figure 8b). The component peak 1 (fit peak 1) corresponds to the Co(II)
cations located in the octahedral site (as expected) bonded to oxygen
atoms, fit peak 2 at binding energy (BE) of 781.9 eV with smaller
area might has generated by the cobalt atoms at the surface of CoFe2O4 forming Co(II)–hydroxide bonds (Co–OH)
and Co(II)–carboxylate bonds (Co–OOC). The fit peak
3 with the smallest area is attributed to L3M45M45 Aüger line of the iron cations.59 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals
of the cobalt atoms in CoFe2O4 exhibited satellite
peak (also called shake-up lines) at higher energies of the main peaks,
which confirm that the oxidation state of the cobalt cations is 2.(Table 3)

(FWHM) of each of the fitted peaks (fit peaks) are presented in Table 3.

The deconvolution of the Fe 2p3/2 XPS line for CoFe2O4 generated three fit peaks located at 709.5,
710.7, and 712.4 eV (Figure 8c). The first and second fit peaks can be attributed to Fe(III)
cations located at octahedral and tetrahedral sites, respectively.
The fit peak 3, located at BE of 712.4 eV, can be assigned to Fe(III)
cations at the surface of the CoFe2O4 bonded
to hydroxyl [OH–] and carboxylate [COO–] groups and to the L2M23M45 Aüger
line coming from the Co(III) cations.59 The deconvolution of the C 1s peak confirms the presence of adventitious
carbon and suggests the presence of a small amount of molecules with
alcohol (7%) and carboxylate (3%) functional groups, adsorbed on the
NPs, possibly coming from the decomposition of H2NCH2COOH (Figure 8d). Appearance of the component of C 1s peak at 288.5 eV suggests
the presence of chemisorbed CO2.60 The BE of the 1s orbital of the oxygen atoms in CoFe2O4 at 529.59 eV is associated to the Co–O and Fe–O
chemical bonds in the cobalt ferrite. In addition, there appeared
small fit peaks with BE of 530.7, 531.5, and 532.4 eV, indicating
the presence of Co–OH, M–OH {M = Co(II), Fe(II)}, and
absorbed H2O at the surface of CoFe2O4 NPs, respectively (Figure 8e).

XPS survey spectrum of the NiFe2O4-6 sample
shown in Figure 9a
indicates that only Ni, Fe, O, and C are present in the sample confirm
its purity. XPS peak with BE of 854.4 eV for the Ni 2p1/2 orbital depicted in Figure 9b confirms the presence of Ni(II)–O chemical bonds
in the NiFe2O4 NPs. Principal component of the
O 1s band located at 529.5 eV indicates the presence of Ni(II)–O
and Fe(III)–O chemical bonds in the ferrite (Figure 9c and Table 4). Also, the component band with peak position
at 531.5 eV indicates the presence of the metal hydroxides {e.g.,
Ni(OH)2, Fe(OH)3} at the surface of the sample
(blue line in Figure 9c).59 As the shape and position of the
XPS peaks for the Fe 2p3/2 and C 1s orbitals in NiFe2O4 NPs were very similar to that of the CoFe2O4 NPs (Figure S2b and d), they have not been discussed further.(Table 4)

NiFe2O4-6 and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6 NPs (a) and

are presented in Table 4.

It is
evident from Figure S2c (Supporting
Information) that the BE of the 1s orbital of the oxygen atoms in
CoFe2O4 is 529.59 eV, whereas for NiFe2O4 it is 529.46 eV. The difference of these BE values
is important because the BE of the O 1s orbital in oxides is correlated
to the basicity of these inorganic compounds.61 In this sense, as O 1s BE decreases, the ability of electron donation
by the oxide becomes higher.62 This electron-donation
capability is important to assess the chemical reactivity of the surface
of the oxide.

XPS survey spectra of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6 sample revealed the presence
of Co, Ni, Fe,
O, and C only in the material (Figure 9a). Deconvolution of the high-resolution XPS band of
the Co 2p3/2 orbital in Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6 generated six sub-bands (fit peaks),
as observed for the CoFe2O4 sample. However,
as the Figure S2a (Supporting Information)
demonstrates, the Co 2p3/2 peak for the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 sample is broader than
in the CoFe2O4 sample. This difference is probably
due to the higher nuclear effective charge of the d electrons of the
Ni(II) cations (7.5) than for the Co(II) cations (6.9). Since the
binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 orbital is 778 eV and the
L3M23M23 Aüger line of nickel
is also located at 778 eV,59 a quantitative
estimation of elemental composition for the compound is not possible
from its XPS analysis. On the other hand, no major difference in the
shape or in the BE in the XPS peaks of Ni 2p orbital for the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 and NiFe2O4 samples was detected (Figure 9b). Since the emission bands for the Fe 2p3/2, O 1s, and C 1s orbitals in Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6 sample are very similar to the corresponding
bands for the CoFe2O4-6 sample (Figure S2b–d, Supporting Information),
we did not perform deconvolution of these bands for the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6 samples.

2.8 Catalytic Reduction of 4-Nitrophenol (4-NP)
to 4-Aminophenol (4-AP)
Some metallic NPs, such as platinum
and silver, have been reported to have catalytic activity in the reduction
of 4-NP to 4-AP.63 However, these chemical
elements are expensive. On the other hand, nickel is an earth-abundant
element with lower market price and strong ferromagnetic character,
which has generated a strong attention as a magnetically separable
catalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants.64 As has been shown in the XRD pattern presented in Figure 1b, the NiFe2O4-3 sample contains a certain amount of phase-separated
nickel NPs. To test the viability of application in catalysis, both
the NiFe2O4-3 and NiFe2O4-6 samples were tested for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP)
to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in their aqueous solution, in presence of
a strong reductor sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The details
of the experimental procedure adapted for catalytic tests for the
ferrites have been presented in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). Although the phase-pure NiFe2O4-6 sample, with no phase-segregated metallic Ni revealed
almost null catalytic activity (results not presented), the phase-impure
NiFe2O4-3 sample with segregated metallic Ni
clusters at its surface presented excellent performance in 4-NP reduction.
The catalytic activity of the reduction of 4-NP of the sample is summarized
in Figure 10a. Although
the band located at 400 nm in Figure 10a corresponds to the 4-nitrophenolate ion obtained
by the deprotonation of the phenol group on adding NaBH4 in the 4-NP solution, the band appeared around 300 nm is attributed
to 4-AP. As can be seen in the inset of Figure 10a and the inset, the NiFe2O4-3 sample degrades the 4-NP almost fully within 160 min. The
reusability of this sample in the catalytic reduction of 4-NP was
tested for six cycles by recovering the catalyst from reaction solution
magnetically. The kinetic absorption spectra correspond to the second
4-NP degradation cycle for the catalyst are shown in Figure 10b. It is interesting to note
that in second cycle of reuse of the catalyst, the reduction of 4-NP
is almost 100% within 60 min. In fact, the 4-NP reduction activity
of the catalyst remained same in the subsequent four cycles. The results
of reusability test of the sample for the cycles 2 to 6 are presented
in Figure S4 (Supporting Information).

absorption spectra correspond to (a) the progressive
reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol using the NiFe2O4-3 sample as catalyst and (b) the first reusability
experiment of the same sample. The time of reaction was counted from
the time of addition of the catalyst. (c) Plots of ln(A/A0) versus time for the reduction of
4-NP during the first 30 min. (d) Percentage of conversion of 4-NP
to 4-AP during the first 60 min.

The difference in the catalytic activity of the sample NiFe2O4-3 in the first and subsequent reaction cycles
can be understood if we consider its fabrication history. The nickel
NPs present in the NiFe2O4-3 sample are responsible
for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. However, during the annealing of
this sample at 600 °C for 2 h (in air atmosphere), the surface
of the nickel NPs probably oxidized to NiO. The NiO shell formed around
nickel NPs hinders the charge transfer between the nitrophenolate
ion and the nickel NPs. Hence, in the first catalytic cycle, a fraction
of the NaBH4 was consumed to reduce the NiO shell to nickel,
and consequently the 15 mg of the NaBH4 added was not enough
to reduce the 4-NP fully even after 160 min (Figure 10a). In contrast, during the reusability
experiments the NiO shell was not present, and a complete reduction
of 4-NP to 4-AP (Figure 10b) occurred within 60 min of addition of the catalyst. In
fact, the ferrimagnetic NiFe2O4 NPs act as magnetic
support for the smaller superparamagnetic nickel NPs, which are responsible
for the catalytic reduction of 4-NP in its aqueous solution. Further,
the fabricated phase-pure spinel ferrite nanoparticles of the samples
CoFe2O4-6, NiFe2O4-6,
and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4-6
have also been tested under same experimental conditions, finding
no catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-NP.

Assuming that
the reduction reaction follows the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism, with a pseudo first-order kinetics, the expression ln(Ct/C0) = ln(At/A0) = −kt can be used to determine the reaction rate constant (k). C and A stand for
the concentration and absorbance of 4-NP at a given time (t), and the subscript 0 stands for the time zero (when t = 0). From the ln(At/A0) versus time plots presented in Figure 10c, it can be seen
that the k values for the reusability cycles are
around 1.17 × 10–3 s–1. Although
the k value for nickel nanowires reported by Sarkar
et al. was 3 × 10–2 min–1,65 the k value reported
by Zhang et al. for their nickel nanoparticles supported on silica
nanotubes is 9.1 × 10–2 s–1.66

Nonmagnetic nanoparticles, such
as Ag, Pt, Au, Cu, and Pd, commonly
used in the reduction of 4-NP, detach away from their supports when
they are stirred, and most of the times they cannot be fully recovered
from the reaction mixture by filtration.67 The high catalytic efficiency (∼97%) maintained by the NiFe2O4 NPs fabricated in this work with N/G ratio 3
even after five reusability cycles probably due to the strong magnetic
nature of both the catalyst (superparamagnetic nickel clusters) and
the support (ferrimagnetic NiFe2O4 NPs), which
not only helps to separate the catalyst from the reaction mixture
fully but also reduces the agglomeration of the catalyst (nickel clusters)
over the ferrite support.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a simple solution combustion technique
for the fabrication of phase-pure small (26–39 nm average size)
CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and
Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs by
adjusting the nitrate/glycine (N/G) ratio to 6 in the reaction mixture.
Unlike other synthesis methods utilized to obtain CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 NPs that use firing
temperatures of 900 or 1200 °C and long annealing time, the solution
combustion method assisted by glycine requires firing temperatures
as low as 600 °C and only 2 h of air annealing. For the N/G ratio
3, a part of the Ni(II) cations and also probably of the Co(II) ions
get reduced by glycine to form corresponding metallic nanoparticles,
generating α-Fe2O3 as a undesired subproduct.
Due to lower size, estimated room-temperature saturation magnetization
(Ms) values of the fabricated phase-pure
(synthesized at N/G ratio 6) spinel ferrite nanostructures are lower
than the Ms values reported for the corresponding
ferrites in the literature. The room-temperature saturation magnetic
moment of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs (43.56 emu/g) remain in between the saturation magnetic
moments of CoFe2O4 NPs (52.63 emu/g) and NiFe2O4 NPs (30.21 emu/g). Although the room-temperature
magnetic coercivity (Hc) of NiFe2O4 NPs is only 159 Oe, it increases up to 886 Oe when
half of the Ni2+ cations are replaced by Co2+ cations (i.e., for Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4). This Hc value for the
Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs synthesized
in this work is 886 Oe, which is even 227 Oe higher than the highest
reported Hc value for this material. The
observed high Hc value of the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs can be attributed
to the hydroxyl and carboxylate groups present at the surface of the
ferrite. The presence of metal-hydroxides {metal = Co(II), Ni(II),
Fe(III)} at the surface of nickel and cobalt ferrites could be detected
from their XPS spectra. Although the phase-pure NiFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs fabricated at N/G ratio
6 are not active catalysts, the phase-impure NiFe2O4 NPs fabricated at the N/G ratio 3 act as highly active catalyst
for the degradation of organic pollutant, such as 4-NP. The work presented
here demonstrates that it is possible to fabricate phase-controlled,
small metal ferrite nanoparticles using a simple solution combustion
technique, which can be applied as nonconductive magnetic cores in
transformers (NiFe2O4 NPs). Although the coercivity
(886 Oe), saturation magnetization (43.56 emu/g), and remanent magnetization
(15.62–43.56 emu/g) values of the fabricated Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 NPs are very much adequate
for their possible application in data storage, the nonstoichiometric
NiFe2O4 NPs (containing Ni clusters) fabricated
through N/G ratio-controlled solution combustion process are effective
catalysts for 4-nitrophenol degradation.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Reagents and Equipment
The reagents
used for the synthesis of ferrite NPs were cobalt nitrate hexahydrate
(Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Sigma, 99.99%),
nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Sigma, 99.99%), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Sigma, 99.99%), glycine (H2NCH2COOH, Aldrich, 99%), and diluted nitric acid
(HNO3, J.T. Baker, 66%). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the samples were recorded in a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray
diffractometer, providing monochromatic Cu Kα emission (λ
= 1.5406 Å) as excitation radiation. Raman spectra of the samples
were collected in a LabRAM-HR spectrometer (HORIBA-Jobin Yvon), equipped
with a He–Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm) and a thermoelectrically
cooled charged couple device detector. A JEOL JSM-7800F field-emission
scanning electron microscope (SEM) operating at 3.0 kV was utilized
for morphology and size evaluation of the nanostructures. Magnetization
hysteresis loops, zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC)
curves of the nanostructures were recorded in a physical property
measurement system (Dyna Cool-9). Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS)
of the powder samples were recorded in a Varian cary-5000 spectrometer.
An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific) with
Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation source was utilized to analyze the
surface composition of the nanostructures. Deconvolution of the core-level
emission bands was performed using Pseudo-Voight2 functions with 70%
Gaussian and 30% Lorentzian components, after subtracting Shirley
type background.

4.2 Synthesis of Nanoparticles
In a typical
synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, 0.873 g
of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2.434 g of
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and 0.970 g of
glycine were dissolved in 70 mL of deionized water in a 600 mL beaker
under magnetic stirring. Then, 1 mL of HNO3 was added to
the mixture. The recipes utilized for the synthesis of six samples
are provided in Table 5. The prepared mixture solutions were heated at 85 °C (under
magnetic stirring) to evaporate the water. On evaporating all of the
water from the mixture, an ignition occurred, and in some cases, a
flame inside the beaker could be observed (see Table 5). The combustion reaction produced a black
or gray powder. It was observed that the flame generated during combustion
lasts longer for the samples containing nickel nitrate. The powder
samples obtained in the solution combustion process were annealed
in an air atmosphere at 600 °C for 2 h, inside a tubular furnace,
using a heating ramp of 2 °C/min. The 600 °C temperature
was chosen for annealing the fabricated samples, as the temperature
was sufficient to eliminate all of the unreacted nitrate precursors
and residual carbon from the samples. The annealed samples were grinded
in an agata mortar and stored for characterization under nitrogen
atmosphere.

The overall chemical reactions
occur during the syntheses of CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 in solution
combustion process can be expressed by eqs 8 and 9 8   9  where n and p are the coefficients proportional to the
number of utilized moles
of nitric acid and glycine, respectively. The coefficients are in
accordance with the mass balance of H, N, O, and C in each chemical
reaction. Note that if the amount of nitric acid (2p) is maintained constant and the amount of glycine (4n) is increased, the amount of required O2 is also increased.
However, the CO2, N2, and water vapor released
during the combustion reaction hamper the entrance of the required
O2 and as a result apart from Ni- and Fe–ferrites,
some metallic nickel or cobalt NPs can be generated.
