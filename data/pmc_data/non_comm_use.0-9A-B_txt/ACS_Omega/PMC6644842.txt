Systemin, an 18 amino-acid-signaling
peptide, was the first plant
polypeptide hormone to be discovered. Earlier structural studies involving
NMR spectroscopy indicated a lack of definite structure in solution
while circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested the presence of left-handed
polyproline II (PPII) conformation. Here, we report the results of
molecular dynamics simulations of the peptide in explicit solvent
with two different force fields, namely, ff99SBildn and ff99IDPs,
both of which showed a large propensity for PPII-like conformations
in spite of showing differing features for other conformational characteristics.
More remarkably, the conformations with predicted chemical shifts
that agreed better with the NMR observations had a larger than average
PPII content, especially for the ff99IDPs force field. An independent
docking calculation of the molecule with the putative receptor SR160
also retained this conformational preference for PPII structure. The
results suggest PPII to be an important class of conformation for
systemin which may have a role in its bioactivity.

==== Body
Introduction
Systemin was first
isolated in 1991 from infected leaves of tomato
(Lycopersicon esculentum) and identified
as a defense-related plant polypeptide hormone.1 It was found to be produced as a response to wounding owing
to insect attack or mechanical damage. Systemin activates the production
of proteinase inhibitors not only in the damaged part but also in
distant parts of the plant, thus signaling a system-wide response
against herbivore attack.

The primary structure of systemin
consisting of 18 amino acids
(AVQSKPPSKRDPPKMQTD) is largely polar, with a number of acidic and
basic residues. It also contains four proline residues at positions
6, 7 and 12, 13. The amino acid arrangement has been described as
pseudopalindromic.1 Apart from tomato,
closely related sequences to systemin have been observed in some other
species of the Solanaceae family including potato (Solanum tuberosum), bell pepper (Capsicum
annuum), and black nightshade (Solanum
nigrum).2−6 There are also a few species outside the Solanaceae family where
the presence of systemin-like sequences has been detected.7,8

A number of experimental studies have been directed toward
the
elucidation of the conformational characteristics of tomato systemin.
A proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy study of systemin
concluded that no persistent secondary structure could be observed
at neutral pH.9 The chemical shifts observed
were found to be similar to the chemical shifts predicted for random
coils.9 On the other hand, circular dichroism
(CD) studies of tomato systemin at different temperatures reported
a distinct presence of significant amount of polyproline II (PPII)
conformation (Figure S1) at low temperature
(5 °C) which gradually became less distinct from the random coil
state as the temperature was raised up to 80 °C.10 The difference in the interpretation of the NMR data9 and the CD data10 may
have arisen because of the lack of 3JNHα coupling data in the NMR study by Russell et al.9 at normal pH. In reports on other peptides, the 3JNHα value of about 5 Hz
has been used for inferring the presence of PPII conformation as opposed
to the β structure which has been ascribed a value of about
10 Hz.11 The coupling results show good
correlation with low-temperature CD studies investigating characteristic
CD signatures for the PPII structure.12

Another NMR study of tomato systemin at low pH (pH 3.2) reported
the presence of the cis-isomer of proline giving rise to a Z-like
β-sheet structure.13 A later CD study
also reported a random coil structure for systemin with some evidence
of the presence of β-sheet and β-turn motifs.14

Currently, an active debate is going on
about whether peptides
with apparent conformational characteristics showing random coil nature
can actually possess some amount of polyproline-like structure.15 This becomes very relevant for the present case
because systemin has a substantial proline-rich region. The sequence
also lacks aromatic residues which are known to reduce the propensity
for taking up a polyproline-like structure.16 A large number of studies now indicate the existence of a heterogeneous
group of small- to medium-sized peptides with unusual proline-rich
sequence characteristics (for a recent review, see ref (17)). It is considered likely
that these sequence characteristics give rise to some structural propensities
that help these molecules to carry out a large number of biological
functions. The occurrence of the left-handed PPII conformation is
considered to be essential for the biological activity of these proline-rich
peptides.17

A structure–function
study on tomato systemin has established
the first 14 residues to be responsible for binding to its putative
receptor, whereas the last 4 residues were considered important for
activation.18 Recently, a DNA aptamer has
been designed to detect systemin in solution.19 The G-rich aptamer sequence is thought to fold into a quadruplex
structure and can selectively bind to the systemin sequence or some
of its fragments but does not bind if the sequence is scrambled. This
observation suggests that the systemin sequence may have some conformational
preferences that facilitate its specific binding. Previously, alanine
scanning and deletion studies reported differential modulation of
the activity of systemin, in particular, a major loss of function
owing to alanine substitution at positions 13 and 17 and a comparatively
less extensive loss of function owing to substitution at position
12.20 We used replica-exchange molecular
dynamics (REMD) simulation in an implicit solvent environment to study
the conformational ensembles of the wild-type systemin along with
its 17 variants to observe that the conformational ensembles of the
17 variants differed in their population distributions, suggesting
a less flexible structure for alanine substitutions at positions 12
and 13 but not for position 17.21 The simulations
revealed very little preference for the wild-type sequence to adopt
α-helical and β-sheet structures. On the other hand, two
regions containing diproline segments showed a tendency to adopt PPII
structures.21

In this work, we have
carried out extensive molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation of tomato systemin in explicit solvent using two different
force fields, ff99SBildn22 and ff99IDPs.23 Calculations have shown that the conformational
ensembles of relatively unstructured proteins simulated with different
force fields can show large differences.24 The AMBER ff99SBildn force field22 incorporates
corrections to the AMBER ff99SB force field25 and is currently recommended for protein simulations. The improvement
was made by modifying the side-chain torsion potentials of four amino
acids (isoleucine, leucine, aspartic acid, and asparagine) to better
reproduce NMR data. However, although the performance of this force
field has shown considerable success in simulating the folding of
small proteins, its performance for unstructured proteins is not so
well-studied. We have also tested another force field, the AMBER ff99IDPs,
that has been constructed and subsequently tested for a more accurate
description of the conformational features of intrinsically disordered
proteins.23,26 The reason for the development of this force
field was that Φ/Ψ dihedral distribution of ordered and
disordered regions, extracted from the protein data bank (PDB) entries,
was significantly different from simulated distributions.23 To correct these discrepancies, the authors
used residue-specific grid-based energy correction maps (CMAP)27,28 for the Φ/Ψ dihedral distribution of eight disorder-promoting
residues (A, G, P, R, Q, S, E, and K).

The conformational ensembles
generated from the MD simulations
were then structurally characterized. Additionally, we predicted proton
chemical shifts from the conformational ensembles and compared the
chemical shift distributions with the experimentally observed shifts.
We also investigated the propensity of the formation of PPII conformation
in different regions of the systemin sequence using a polyproline
assignment algorithm.

To acquire further insights into the extent
of similarity or difference
in the conformational ensembles generated by the two force fields,
ff99SBildn and ff99IDPs, we carried out principal component analysis
(PCA)29,30 followed by cluster analysis. The majority
of the variance in a data set is usually captured by the first few
principal components (PCs). As conformational flexibility is dependent
on the potential energy of the molecule, the PCA also reveals the
characteristics of the underlying free-energy landscape. In the case
of clustering MD data, one essentially wants to cluster conformations
based on their underlying free-energy landscape to find out the metastable
states of the protein.

Because both the force fields tested
by us were derived from the
AMBER ff99SB force field, we have also performed shorter 150 ns MD
simulations on the representative conformations of the largest clusters
from both the AMBER-derived force fields using the CHARMM36m force
field, a very recent force field for CHARMM31 recommended for small peptides and IDPs32 to check the consistency of our results.

We also reported
preliminary results on the probable location and
preferred conformations of systemin in its interaction with a putative
160 kD receptor (SR160).33

Results and Discussion
Distribution
of the Radius of Gyration
Computational
study of the ensemble of conformations adopted by intrinsically unstructured
proteins and peptides is in principle capable of providing a wealth
of structural information but as yet faces a problem of disagreement
between predictions made utilizing different force fields.24 We have used two different AMBER-derived force
fields in our MD calculations for the evaluation and comparison of
the conformational ensembles of systemin and also a CHARMM force field
for checking the consistency of our major results. In Figure 1, we have plotted the distribution
of the radius of gyration (Rg) of systemin
for investigating the ranges for the linear dimensions of the peptide
as predicted by these two force fields. The overall features of the
distributions were similar for both the force fields. The distributions
showed a large population near 9 Å and a small amount of population
extending up to 16 Å for both the force fields. For the sampling
of conformations over 600 ns, the average value of the Rg was calculated as about 9.7 Å for both the ff99SBildn
and ff99IDPs force fields. We have also plotted the time evolution
of the Rg and root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd) from the initial structure (Figures S2 and S3) for both trajectories. These results showed that after
the initial fluctuations, the ff99IDPs force field sampled conformations
with relatively less overall fluctuation compared to the conformations
sampled by the ff99SBildn force field.

Figure 1 Distribution of the radius
of gyration of systemin for calculations
involving the ff99SBildn and ff99IDPs force fields.

Compared to the AMBER family of force fields, calculations
using
the CHARMM36m force field sampled conformations with larger Rg values irrespective of the starting peptide
conformation (Figure S4) showing its preference
for generating extended conformations for the peptide.

One can
compare the average values of the radius of gyration (Rg) of systemin from our simulation with that
expected on the basis of the assumption that the polypeptide is a
random coil with conformational distributions governed by the Flory
isolated-pair hypothesis.34 On the basis
of this hypothesis, Kohn et al.35 proposed
that Rg of a random coil polypeptide with N residues should scale as Rg = R0Nν, where R0 = 1.927 Å and ν
= 0.598. For an 18 amino acid polypeptide, the estimated Rg based on the scaling relationship35 was obtained as 10.85 Å. This implied that although
systemin did not seem to possess any persistent secondary structure,
it did not behave as a completely random coil either.

Secondary Structure
Propensities
We calculated the
residue-wise secondary structure propensities (Figure 2) from the trajectories of the 600 ns MD
simulations. Schweitzer-Stenner has proposed to consider the conformational
distribution of a polypeptide as a random coil-like structure if it
samples the allowed Ramachandran region almost uniformly, leading
to an approximate 30% propensities for the right-handed α-helix,
the β-sheet, and the left-handed PPII conformations.36 Our DSSP37 calculations
on the trajectories for both the force fields (Figure 2) showed almost no propensity for the residues
to adopt the right-handed α-helix conformation, and accordingly,
the conformational distribution of systemin could not be called a
random coil.

Figure 2 Residue-wise secondary structure propensity. Two force
fields are
represented in columns (a) ff99SBildn and (b) ff99IDPs, where the X-axis denotes residues and the Y-axis
denotes the propensity for the respective secondary structures.

The secondary structure propensities
as assigned by the DSSP algorithm
showed a very insignificant tendency to adopt β-sheet, α-helix,
or 310 helix conformations. On the other hand, it identified
specific regions having a strong preference for the bend or the turn
conformations. We also observed (Figure S5) that these bend or turn structures were relatively stable over
the course of the simulations once they were formed.

Secondary
structure calculations using the DSSP program showed
that there was no significant type of secondary structures other than
bends in the ensembles sampled by the CHARMM36m force field (data
not shown).

The PPII helical conformation is increasingly being
associated
with unstructured proteins and peptides, and it is also being suggested
as the third most abundant conformation after α-helix and β-sheet
structures.38 Not surprisingly, proline
is present in many such PPII helices.39 The presence of two diproline segments in systemin together with
the experimental observation10 of PPII-like
conformation at low temperatures and our earlier observation from
implicit solvent simulation21 prompted
us to analyze the ensembles generated by the two force fields for
the occurrence of the PPII structure.

Because DSSP did not provide
any information about the possibility
of formation of the PPII helix structure, we used the PPII assignment
method embodied in the PROSS (http://folding.chemistry.msstate.edu/utils/pross.html) structure assignment tool.

For both the ff99SBildn and ff99IDPs
force fields, the PPII propensities
showed a more or less symmetrical distribution commensurate with the
pseudopalindromic nature of the systemin sequence (Figure 3). However, there were noticeable
differences in the predicted residue-wise PPII propensities for the
two force fields. Among these differences, the most prominent was
the PPII propensities of Pro7 and Pro13 residues. The ff99IDPs force
field showed stronger PPII propensities for these two residues compared
to the ff99SBildn.

Figure 3 Residue-wise plot of the PPII propensities for the (a)
ff99SBildn
and (b) ff99IDPs force fields.

Although the region with the PPII structure as indicated
by the
PROSS program in our simulated ensembles did not cover very long stretches
as might be expected for trans-polyproline and for
proteins/peptides with a large content of proline such as collagen,
the findings were consistent with reports that showed that PPII conformations
could occur over relatively short stretches.40,41 The amino acids in the central region of systemin were not found
to be favorable for the formation of the PPII structure.

In Figure 4, we
have plotted the time evolution of the PPII propensities in systemin
for the two force fields. Apparently, the ff99IDPs force field generated
stabler and more concentrated PPII segments near the proline residues
compared to the ff99SBildn force field.

Figure 4 Residue-wise time series
plots for the presence of PPII conformation
as assigned by the PROSS algorithm for the (a) ff99SBildn and (b)
ff99IDPs force fields. Red color indicates the presence of the PPII
structure, whereas blue color indicates the absence of the PPII structure.

PROSS calculations showed (Figure S6) that, in general, the trajectory generated
by the CHARMM36m force-field-sampled
conformations in which the PPII structure was favored over the whole
peptide in comparison with the conformations sampled by the AMBER
family of force fields. However, the propensity of the PPII structure
for the diproline regions was not as high as in the conformations
sampled with the AMBER family of force fields. This observation was
also reflected in the timeline plots (Figure S7) of the PPII structure from the ensemble generated by the CHARMM36m
force field.

Principal Component Analysis
For
the analysis of the
PCA data, we have plotted the scree plots (Figure S8) for both the force fields to estimate the proportion of
variance captured by each PCs based on their eigenvalue rank. Interestingly,
PC1 of ff99IDPs ensemble accounted for around 73% of the variance
alone.

Figure 5 shows the residue-wise contribution to the first three PCs for both
the force fields. As PCA captures the essential motion of the molecule
and PC1 accounts for the majority of the variance within the data,
we found that both the force fields sampled conformations in which
the central region of the peptide molecule was more rigid than both
the terminal regions.

Figure 5 Residue-wise contribution (Å) to the first three
PCs for the
(a) ff99SBildn and (b) ff99IDPs force fields. X-axis
corresponds to residue numbers and Y-axis shows the
contribution for individual PCs.

Clustering
The conformations were clustered using the
PC subspace data. Simple Euclidean distance of points in the PC subspace
was used as the similarity measure between two conformations. On the
basis of the scree test (Figure S8), we
utilized the first six PCs for the ff99SBildn data, whereas the first
four PCs were used for the ff99IDPs data. In Figure S9, we plotted the SSR/SST ratio for both the force fields.
Inspection of the elbow point showed that a cluster count of 5 for
both the force fields could be an optimum choice.

After clustering
the ff99SBildn data on a six-dimensional PC subspace and the ff99IDPs
data on a four-dimensional PC subspace, the conformations were plotted
in the first two PC planes (Figure 6). Analysis of the plot showed that conformations sampled
by the two force fields were not identical. The overall spread of
the conformations sampled by the ff99SBildn force field indicated
a relatively flat free-energy landscape compared to that obtained
from the ff99IDPs force field.

and (b) ff99IDPs
force fields were projected on the PC1–PC2 plane. (In both
the plots, cluster 1 is red, cluster 2 is green, cluster 3 is blue,
cluster 4 is cyan, and cluster 5 is purple.)

Bioinformatic Analysis of Systemin Chemical Shifts
Experimental
observations indicate that, at neutral pH and physiological
temperature, the peptide hormone systemin does not have a strong structural
preference. The first proton NMR study of the molecule, in fact, assigned
most of the residues, except for a few C-terminal ones, to the random
coil state.9

Within the intervening
period after the experimental study of systemin conformation by proton
NMR spectroscopy, there has been a lot of activity on the structural
bioinformatics front that strove to use the chemical shift information
to gain insight into the behavior of proteins and peptides which show
some degree of structural disorder. Chemical shifts are relatively
accurate parameters that reflect the local structural properties of
a nucleus. In proteins, they get influenced by the primary, secondary,
and tertiary structure of the protein. Proton chemical shifts in proteins
are sensitive to several factors such as conformation, hydrogen bonding,
electric field, ring currents, and temperatures.42,43 Also, the degree of sensitivity varies depending on the chemical
groups. Several studies44,45 showed that α-proton
chemical shifts and the secondary structure are related in such a
way that α-helical conformation induces upfield shift, whereas
β-sheets induce downfield shift from random coil values. Hydrogen
bonds strongly influence amide proton chemical shifts which show a
sensitive dependence on the hydrogen bond donor–acceptor distance.
Ring currents of the nearby aromatic groups are other important contributors
which significantly affect the α-proton chemical shifts. The
chemical shift of a residue is dependent on the sequence also.46 Wishart et al.46 measured 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts from
Gly–Gly–X–Y–Gly–Gly peptides (where
X can be any of the 20 amino acids and Y can be either Ala or Pro)
in a consistent experimental condition and compared these shift values
systematically. They found significant differences among the chemical
shifts owing to the presence of the prolines in the Y-position of
the hexapeptide.

A lot of work has been devoted to discriminate
between the chemical
shift data that came out of a structured region and the so-called
“random coil” region. A basic step in this regard has
been the compilation of random coil chemical shift libraries by various
groups.47−49 In Table S1, we have reported
the results of calculations of chemical shifts using the ncIDP predictor49 of the α-protons of systemin from sequence
information only, assuming the polypeptide to be entirely in the random
coil state. These shift values have been compared subsequently to
the experimental shifts reported by Russell et al.9

The random coil chemical shifts calculated according
to three different
prescriptions proposed by Schwarzinger et al.,47 Wang and Jardetzky,48 and Tamiola
et al.49 showed some difference among themselves.

The closest set of predictions according to the rmsd from the experiment
came from the library proposed by Tamiola et al.49 The calculation of the data set in this library utilized
a method of taking into account the context dependence of an amino
acid residue and its consequence on the chemical shift values.

The calculations showed that when context dependence was taken
into account, the Russell et al.9 data
were quite close to the Tamiola et al.49 prediction. This was consistent with the suggestion that systemin
may have a substantial amount of strongly disordered regions.

Tamiola and Mulder50 also proposed a
method to investigate the residue-wise structural propensity, given
an amino acid sequence and chemical shift data with the help of their
neighbor-corrected chemical shift library. As shown in Figure 7, the neighbor-corrected structural
propensity calculations identified the regions 11–13 as having
significant structural propensity relative to the other regions. Although
their original method classified the structures as either right-handed
α-helical or extended β-sheet, those calculations might
be too restrictive for the systemin sequence. If we just infer from
these calculations the degree of expected structural disorder locally
from the given chemical shift data, the data strongly point to the
region spanning residues 11–13 in systemin as having structural
properties significantly different from a random coil.

structural propensity plot for systemin.50

Chemical Shift Prediction
from Conformational Ensembles
In Figure 8, we have
plotted the distribution of the α-proton chemical shift calculated
using the shift prediction protocol SPARTA+51 on our simulation trajectories obtained with the two force fields.
In general, the predictions strongly overlapped only for a few residues
and in some cases showed nonoverlapping values with the experimentally
determined values. The predictions using both the force fields better
matched with the experimental data for Lys5, Pro6, Asp11, and Pro12.

Figure 8 Histograms
of the predicted α-proton chemical shifts from
the ff99SBildn and ff99IDPs force fields. In each histogram, yellow
color indicates the ff99SBildn and blue color indicates the ff99IDPs
force fields. The red dot indicates the position of the experimental
chemical shift.

To have a qualitative
idea of the force field that generated conformational
ensembles closer to the experimental chemical shifts, we calculated
and plotted the quantity (|exp – ildn| – |exp –
idp|), where the |...| symbol denotes the rmsd value of the simulated
quantity from the experimental chemical shift,9 (exp) denotes the α-proton chemical shift of a residue, and
ildn and idp denote the ensembles generated from the ff99SBildn and
ff99IDPs force fields, respectively (Figure 9). We have also plotted the quantity (|exp
– rc|), where the |...| symbol denotes absolute value, exp
is the experimental α-proton chemical shift of a residue from
Russell et al.,9 and rc denotes the chemical
shift of a residue predicted using the random coil chemical shift
library proposed by Tamiola et al.49 From Figure 9, it is apparent
that the best model for the experimental data is still provided by
the random coil chemical shift library. Between the two force fields,
the ff99SBildn force field generated conformations for which the SPARTA+
predictions were apparently closer to the experimental shift values.

Figure 9 Plot of
difference in magnitudes of the rmsd discrepancy of α-proton
shift prediction derived from the two force fields used.

Figure 10 shows
the scatter plots of PPII propensity versus α-proton chemical
shift rmsd for both the force fields. The plots show slightly weak
negative correlation between the chemical shift rmsd and the PPII
propensity calculated as −0.256 for the ff99SBildn force field
and −0.413 for the ff99IDPs force field. For comparison, the
correlation is even weaker for PPII versus Rg (0.193 and 0.29 for the two force fields ff99SBildn and ff99IDPs,
respectively).

Comparison of Structures from the Two Force
Fields
We isolated 20 structures based on the lowest α-proton
chemical
shift rmsds (listed in Table S2) from the
conformational ensembles generated with both the force fields (Figure 11). Although the
ff99SBildn force field showed distinct groups of structures, the structures
obtained from the ff99IDPs force field were more homogeneous and showed
slightly extended conformations.

Figure 11 Twenty structures from simulations with
the (a) ff99SBildn and
(b) ff99IDPs force fields based on the lowest α-proton chemical
shift rmsd values. Blue and red colors indicate N- and C-terminals,
respectively.

In Figure 12, we
have plotted the residue-wise PPII propensity for both the force fields.
It is clear from the figure that for both the force fields, the conformations
showing low rmsd values (averaged over the lowest 20 structures) for
α-proton chemical shifts were assigned a larger propensity for
the PPII structure than the average over the entire ensemble. However,
there was some difference in the nature of the increased PPII propensities
for the two force fields. For the ff99SBildn force field, the increase
in the PPII content was noticeable for the residues which were already
showing significant PPII propensity over the whole trajectory. Only
Val2 and Met15 showed a marked increase in the PPII content for the
20 structures with the lowest α-proton chemical shift rmsd values
compared to that of the whole trajectory. By contrast, the ff99IDPs
force field had very different PPII propensities between the 20 structures
with the lowest α-proton chemical shift rmsd and the entire
trajectory. Residues which already had high PPII content for the entire
trajectory showed only slight increase in the PPII content. On the
other hand, residues Val2, Gln3, Ser4, Ser8, Lys9, Arg10, and Gln16
showed noticeable increase in the PPII content. Owing to this increase
in the PPII content of additional residues in the 20 structures with
the lowest α-proton chemical shift rmsd values, a stretch from
residues 2–14 was seen to favor the PPII conformation.

Figure 12 Residue-wise
PPII propensity from simulations with the (a) ff99SBildn
and (b) ff99IDPs force fields. Blue color indicates the average PPII
propensity of 20 structures based on the lowest α-proton chemical
shift rmsd values, whereas red color denotes the average PPII propensity
of the entire trajectory.

We also observed that residue-wise PPII propensities for
conformations
that showed lower chemical shift rmsd values as sampled by the ff99IDPs
force field resulted in an increased overall PPII content. This feature
of the ff99IDPs force field might have arisen because of the way it
was parameterized with respect to its base force field, that is, ff99SBildn.

During the construction of the new ff99IDPs force field, Wang et
al.23 modified the backbone torsion energy
term for the eight disorder-promoting residues using CMAP.27,28 They prepared the dihedral angle distribution benchmark data from
42 774 disordered fragments. Distribution of dihedral angles
of the eight disorder-promoting residues into four principal regions
(i.e., αL, αR, PPII, and β-region)
showed significant difference compared to that of the ordered structures.
A major part of this difference originated because of the increased
PPII population in the benchmark data set. Over the course of the
parameter optimization, Wang et al.23 systematically
tried to reproduce the observed increased propensity for the PPII
conformation in their ff99IDPs force field.

Interaction of Systemin
with Its Putative Receptor
In Figure 13, we
have shown the modeling results for the interaction of systemin with
a model of the extracellular domain of the SR160 receptor using the
GalaxyPepDock protocol.52 All of the generated
models showed the peptide to be preferentially located near the 68
amino acid long island region53 close to
the C-terminal region of the modeled SR160 receptor. We also calculated
the PPII propensity of the 10 peptides in their bound conformations
as modeled by GalaxyPepDock. Figure 14 shows the average PPII propensity of these 10 conformers.
It was noticed that the nature of the PPII propensity observed in
these 10 modeled peptides was similar to that observed in the 20 conformations
isolated on the basis of the lowest α-proton chemical shift
rmsd value from the conformational ensemble generated with the ff99IDPs
force field.

Conclusions
In
spite of being the first plant polypeptide hormone to be discovered,
we have surprisingly little mechanistic understanding of the mode
of action of systemin. A number of experimental and theoretical studies
have probed its conformation in solution and came up with varied answers.

Bioinformatic analysis of the observed chemical shifts from the
proton NMR study of systemin9 indicated
the nearest-neighbor prediction model49 to be the closest approximation to its conformation, and the polypeptide
conformation was predicted to be nearly disordered. Further analysis
indicated the possibility that the contiguous region spanning positions
11–14 may have some structural bias.

Presence of disorder
predicted by the bioinformatic analysis motivated
us to study the ensemble of conformations by MD simulations. We utilized
two force fields, ff99SBildn22 and one
of its variants specifically designed for studying unstructured proteins,
ff99IDPs.23 The ensembles generated by
the two force fields were compared for distributions over different
conformational characteristics which were found to be different in
various respects. The radius of gyration was much more uniformly distributed
over a large range in ff99SBildn than in ff99IDPs. Although the peptide
was found to be flexible overall, the PCA revealed that the central
region contributed very less to the first PC, implying reduced conformational
variability in that region for both the force fields. The PCA of the
conformations generated using the two force fields showed clear differences
in their ability to sample the free-energy landscape of systemin.
Although ff99SBildn showed overlapping conformational clusters indicative
of a flat energy landscape, ff99IDPs partitioned the population into
a relatively fewer number of segregated clusters, implying a more
rugged free-energy landscape.

However, our simulation data using
the two force fields showed
a general trend favoring PPII conformation about the two diproline
segments, whereas residues at the center and toward both ends seemed
to disfavor PPII conformation. Remarkably, we also observed that the
conformations that showed lower rmsd values between the predicted
and experimentally observed chemical shifts were more likely to show
enhanced propensity for the PPII structure. It is also interesting
to note that the PPII-forming regions were within the N-terminal region
spanning the first 14 residues that were found to be responsible for
binding with the receptor.18 This prompted
us to speculate that the PPII conformation may play a role in the
bioactivity of systemin.

Materials and Methods
MD Simulations
The energy minimization and MD simulations
were performed using the AMBER 12 program suite.54 The pmemd.MPI module was used for minimization, whereas
the pmemd.cuda module was used for equilibration and production runs.
The simulations were started from an uncapped systemin polypeptide
in extended conformation created using the leap module. We used TIP3P
water model55 for solvation in an octahedron
box, where 10 Å separation was used between the peptide and box
walls. Periodic boundary condition was applied during simulations.
Both systems were neutralized by replacing two water molecules with
two Cl–. After this, energy minimization was performed
in two steps. First, the solute was kept fixed, whereas water and
ions were free to move during minimization. Next, the entire system
was energy-minimized. In each energy minimization process, 1000 steepest
decent steps were followed by 1000 conjugate gradient steps. The energy-minimized
system was then heated to 298 K in an NVT simulation for 20 ps while keeping the solute fixed.
Next, the restraint on the solute was removed, and the system was
equilibrated under 1 atm pressure for 100 ps. Production runs were
carried out under 1 atm pressure and at 298 K temperature where a
time step of 2 fs was used, and the coordinates were saved at 4 ps
interval. Throughout the simulation, a 10 Å cutoff was used for
the calculation of nonbonded interactions, and SHAKE algorithm56 was used to constrain the bonds involving hydrogens.
Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated with the particle
mesh Ewald (PME) method.57 Identical protocols
were used for the two force fields, namely, AMBER ff99SBildn22 and AMBER ff99IDPs,23 employed in this work. The production runs were continued for 600
ns. We have plotted (Figures S10 and S11) the residue-wise cumulative averages of predicted α-proton
chemical shifts for both ensembles to ensure that the chemical shifts
were reasonably converged.

The radius of gyration (Rg) and residue-wise secondary structures were calculated
using the cpptraj module of AmberTools 14.58 The secondary structure characteristics were calculated using DSSP
embedded in AmberTools 14. Because DSSP does not report PPII conformation,
we used the dihedral angle-based secondary structure assignment tool
PROSS. It uses only the backbone torsion angles for the secondary
structure assignment. The torsion angle space is divided into a two-dimensional
(Φ/Ψ) grid of cells referred to as mesostates. Four of
these mesostates are mapped to the PPII conformation with Φ
ranging from −45° to −115° and Ψ ranging
from 120° to 180°. Calculated Φ/Ψ angles of
each residue were then mapped to the grid and subsequently classified
into different secondary structures.

α-Proton chemical
shifts were predicted using SPARTA+.51 Visualization
and plotting were done using pymol59 and
R statistical software package.60

Principal
Component Analysis
PCs were obtained from
the covariance matrix of the Cartesian coordinate data set. Eigenvectors
and eigenvalues were calculated from this covariance matrix, and then
the eigenvectors were rearranged according to their eigenvalues in
decreasing order. The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue was
the first PC and so on. The first PC contains the highest proportion
of variance in the data. We used the R package bio3D61 for PCA. Cartesian coordinate information of the C-α
atoms of the peptide at every 400 ps interval was sampled to build
the 54 × 1500 input data matrix for the PCA.

Clustering
We used hierarchical algorithm for clustering
the PC subspace using R statistical software package.60 The number of PCs for clustering was decided based on the
scree test.62 To determine an optimal number
of clusters, we calculated the SSR/SST ratio using the kmeans function of the R software suit. The SSR is known as the between-cluster
sum of squares, which is calculated as the sum of squared distances
of each cluster mean to the global sample mean. SST is called the
total sum of squares and is calculated as the sum of squared distances
of each component to the global sample mean. The SSR/SST ratio lies
between 0 and 1, and the value increases with the increase in the
number of clusters. To determine the optimum number of clusters, one
looks for an “elbow” in the curve which suggests no
significant gain in new information owing to an increase in the cluster
number.

Homology Modeling
We have modeled the putative systemin
receptor SR16033 for further studying the
binding interaction with systemin. The primary sequence of SR160 from Lycopersicon peruvianum (accession number AAM48285.1) was downloaded from the NCBI protein database. It is a 1207 amino
acid long protein in which 408 residues in the C-terminal region contain
the transmembrane and a Ser–Thr kinase domain.53 As systemin is known to bind in the extracellular space,
we have removed this region before building the receptor model of
SR160.

MODELLER63 version 9.15 was
used for modeling SR160. For template identification, we searched
the pdb_95.pir database that contains nonredundant PDB sequences at
95% sequence identity. On the basis of the sequence identity as well
as crystallographic resolution, we used the brassinosteroid-insensitive
1 (BRI1, PDB ID: 3RGZ) protein as the template. It had 60% sequence identity with SR160.
After target-template alignment, we found long stretches of gaps in
the N and C termini (38 and 11 residues, respectively) of the target
sequence, which were deleted before building the model. We generated
20 models, and the model with the lowest DOPE score64 was used for further docking.

Docking
The GalaxyPepDock
server52 was used for docking the systemin
peptide with the modeled
SR160. The method follows a fast docking protocol based on the receptor
structure and the peptide ligand sequence. On the basis of the sequence
characteristics of the peptide, it combines information from similar
interactions in a structure database and energy optimization. It performs
similarity-based docking by finding templates from the database of
experimentally determined structures and building models using energy-based
optimization that allows for structural flexibility. The server can
therefore effectively model the structural differences between the
template and target protein/peptide complexes.
