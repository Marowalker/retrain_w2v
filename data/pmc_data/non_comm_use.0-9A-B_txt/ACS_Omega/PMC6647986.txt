An efficient and environmentally
sustainable method for the synthesis
of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives by domino A3-coupling reaction catalyzed by Cu(II)–ascorbate was
developed in aqueous micellar media in the presence of sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS). The catalyst, a dynamic combination of Cu(II)/Cu(I),
was generated in situ in the reaction mixture by mixing CuSO4 with sodium ascorbate and aided a facile 5-exo-dig
cycloisomerization of alkynes with the condensation products of 2-aminopyridines
and aldehydes to afford a variety of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in good overall yields. A simple experimental setup, water
as the “green” medium, and inexpensive catalyst and
auxiliary are some of the merits of this protocol.

Introduction
Imidazopyridine, a
nitrogen-fused bicyclic system containing an
imidazole moiety fused with pyridine is a common structural scaffold
in many biologically active compounds and natural products.1 Prominent among them are imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines which are of great pharmaceutical interest as
they show a broad range of pharmacological activities.2 They have also shown their potential to act as β-amyloid
formation inhibitors,3a GABA and benzodiazepine
receptor agonists,3b cardiotonic agents,3c and so on.3 Many
commercially available drugs, such as zolpidem (for insomnia), alpidem
(anxiolytic agents), zolimidine (for peptic ulcer) contain imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine moiety (Figure 1).4 In addition, molecular
architectures that incorporate the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
moiety in the framework have demonstrated potential applicability
in optoelectronics, dyes, and sensing materials.5

Figure 1 Structure of biologically active imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines.

Owing to their vast applications,
tremendous research interest
has been expressed to develop clean and efficient synthetic methodologies
for imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines.4 Classical synthetic routes to imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
include condensation followed by heterocyclization of 2-aminopyridines
with α-haloketones6 or α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds.7 Apart from this, several
other interesting approaches, such as multicomponent reactions, tandem
sequences, and transition-metal-catalyzed C–H functionalizations
have been developed for this heterocycle, mostly in conventional reaction
media.4,8 Among vast literature, our interest was
focused on A3-coupling reactions to afford this heterocycle
via 5-exo-dig cyclization.4,9 After
the elegant work of Gevorgyan and Chernyak,9a various other catalytic methods have been developed in conventional
media which include CuSO4–TsOH in refluxing toluene,9b Cu(I)–NaHSO4–SiO2 in toluene,9c InBr3 in refluxing toluene,9d iron oxide nanoparticles
in refluxing toluene,9e and so on.4,9f−9i However, these methods have one or more shortcomings such as requirement
of dry conditions, use of hazardous organic solvents, Brønsted
acids, high temperature, and so forth.

With the realization
of the concept of “green chemistry”10 and with its emerging demands in the present
day in order to protect our environment, significant research efforts
have been focused on the replacement of hazardous organic solvents
and reagents with nontoxic chemicals and environmentally benign solvents
for any chemical transformation. In particular, the solvent is a crucial
factor in any chemical transformation which accounts for the generation
of up to 85% of the waste.11 The most promising
alternative is to replace organic solvents by water. In many cases,
the immiscibility of the organic components in aqueous media is addressed
by the use of surfactants which form micelles or other assemblies,
and bring the substrates in the “nanoconfined” hydrophobic
cores and thereby, facilitate organic transformations.12 Over decades, “micellar catalysis”
has emerged as a sustainable alternative to various conventional reactions.13

Although few green protocols are available
for the synthesis of
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines on heterogeneous supports,
they involve the synthesis of complex Cu catalysts, making them more
expensive methods.14 However, several commercially
available copper salts are very cheap and water soluble, rendering
easy recovery of products. Another interesting method reported by
Siddiqui et al.,15 the only metal-free
A3-coupling of this kind, involves mild oxidant I2 to act as a catalyst to afford imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
at a surprisingly low temperature. However, to our dismay, we failed
to obtain any desired product following their methodology for several
attempts on different substrates, even under refluxing conditions.
The reactions partly proceed up to the formation of condensation products
only, presumably because of limited contact of the catalyst, iodine
with water-insoluble reaction intermediates. Based on the above facts,
we envisaged that the development of a mild and green protocol for
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines by domino A3-coupling
involving inexpensive catalysts will be a worthy pursuit. As part
of our continued efforts in the development of environmentally sustainable
methods in “micellar media”,16 we report herein, CuSO4–ascorbate catalyzed synthesis
of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in water in the presence
of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the surfactant (Scheme 1). CuSO4–ascorbate
was envisaged as the catalyst based on the fact that a combination
of Cu(II)/Cu(I) works better than a single Cu(I) catalyst.9f,9h

Results and Discussion
At the outset, efforts were put together
in optimizing the reaction
condition. 2-aminopyridine (1a), benzaldehyde (2a), and phenylacetylene (3a) were selected as
the substrates for model reactions during initial investigations of
the A3-coupling reaction. The investigation was begun with
examining the formation of emulsion droplets of different surfactants
containing aqueous solutions of reaction mixtures after 5 min of stirring
at room temperature under an optical microscope (Figure 2a). Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) experiments of typical reaction mixtures revealed that the size
of emulsion droplets is in the nanometer range with the presence of
smaller (20–40 nm) and larger droplets (100–800 nm)
with an average diameter of 461 nm (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 (a) A typical optical micrograph of nanoreactors
formed in an aqueous
solution of SDS, 2-aminopyridine, benzaldehyde, and phenyl acetylene.
(b) DLS data of SDS showing micellar aggregates; the average size
is 461 nm.

Next, a thorough screening of
various surfactants, catalysts, and
reaction temperature was done to arrive at the optimum condition of
the A3-coupling reaction. Four different classes of surfactants,
viz. SDS (anionic), cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, cationic),
Triton X-100 and Tween 20 (neutral), and p-dodecylbenzenesulfonic
acid (DBSA, Brønsted acid) were selected, and model reactions
were conducted in the presence of 10 mol % of different surfactants
and CuSO4–ascorbate as the catalyst, first at room
temperature and then under mild heating (upto 50 °C). To our
delight, the anionic surfactant, SDS could efficiently provide a micellar
media to allow the reaction to proceed forward and afford the desired
product (4a) in excellent yields at 50 °C after
6 h (Table 1, entry
3). It was observed that imine formation takes place within 30 min
and the reaction proceeds further to form the A3-coupled
product (4a). In a separate reaction, under similar conditions,
the condensation product of 2-aminopyridine (1a) and
benzaldehyde (2a) was isolated and confirmed by 1H NMR. Although the yield is less, the neutral surfactants
were also found effective for the coupling reaction (Table 1, entry 5 and 6). As expected,
the reaction was very sluggish in the absence of surfactants even
at 80 °C after 24 h, yielding only 14% of 4a (Table 1, entry 1). This implies
that the micellar “nanoreactors”12 are necessary to bring together water-insoluble components
in their hydrophobic core and facilitate the reaction to proceed forward.
The reaction in the presence of SDS at a higher temperature did not
afford better yield of 4a (Table 1, entry 4). The same reaction in the presence
of CTAB did not proceed well (Table 1, entry 7).

d Upto 40% of the starting material

e Some imine was left in the reaction

Presumably,
electrostatic repulsion of positively charged CTAB
with copper ions prevents the catalyst to penetrate into the “nanoreactor”.
Similarly, DBSA was not found to be a suitable choice as it may protonate
2-aminopyridine (2a) and inhibit further progress of
the reaction (Table 1, entry 8). Next, focus was paid in identifying the most suitable
copper catalyst for the said reaction. Initially, various Cu(I) salts
were used for the reaction and up to 71% of the yield of 4a was observed but the rate of the reaction significantly slowed down
(Table 1, entries 11–13).
However, only the Cu(II) salt failed to produce measurable amount
of the desired product; the reaction did not proceed after imine formation
(Table 1, entry 14).
Other than sodium ascorbate, d-glucose and sodium citrate
were used as reducing agents. Although d-glucose could afford 4a in 72% yield (but only after 12 h) (Table 1, entry 17), sodium citrate was found to
be not suitable for the same as the major product was imine even after
24 h (Table 1, entry
18). By varying the mol % of sodium ascorbate (NaOAs), it was found
that the use of 20 mol % NaOAs is ideal for A3-coupling
of this kind (Table 1, entries 3,15,16). Therefore, for further investigations, a combination
of 10 mol % SDS, 10 mol % CuSO4·5H2O, and
20 mol % of NaOAs was considered as the optimum catalyst concentration,
and the reaction temperature was set at 50 °C.

Under the
optimized condition, the method was validated with various
2-aminopyridines (1) and aromatic aldehydes (2) in the presence of phenylacetylene (3a) to afford
a large variety of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines (4) in good to excellent yields (Table 2). All the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives were thoroughly characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS analysis. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were in good agreement with the reported values
of the known compounds. The appearance of a characteristic benzylic
(−CH2−) singlet peak within a range δ
4.20–4.66 ppm confirmed the formation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives. The same characteristic peak appeared
at around δ 30 ppm in 13C NMR of all compounds. In
general, the electron-donating (Table 2, 4q–z) or mild electron-withdrawing
substituent (Table 2, 4aa–ah) on the 2-aminopyridines does not have
any significant effect on the reaction rate or yield of the products.
It was observed that the reaction takes relatively longer time to
complete when strong electron-withdrawing groups are present in the
aromatic ring of the aldehyde (Table 2, 4f–k, 4s, 4x–z, 4af–ah) as compared to those
having electron-donating groups (Table 2, 4b–e, 4ac,ad). It is also noteworthy to mention that relatively unstable
heteromatic aldehydes such as furfural and thiophene-2-carboxyaldehye
participated in the reaction with equal efficiency to afford corresponding
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives in good yields
(Table 2, 4o,p). However, reactions involving N-heteroaromatic aldehydes, such as indole-2-carboxyaldehyde and pyrrole-2-carboxyaldehyde,
were not fair as they generate a nonisolable complex mixture of products
presumably because of the interference of competing amine residue
in the heteroaromatic ring. The same methodology was extended to representative
aliphatic aldehydes, and, in general, good yields were obtained for
the desired product (Table 2, 4ai–am).

the Synthesis of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in Aqueous
Micellar Media

of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine Derivatives (4)a
a All yields refer to an isolated
product.

Based on the above
results, a plausible mechanism has been proposed
for this domino A3-coupling reaction (Scheme 2). The reaction is initiated
by the formation of the condensation products of 2-aminopyridines
(1) and aromatic aldehydes (2) inside the
hydrophobic core of the micelle. This “dehydration”
step is facilitated by the micelle as the product water molecule is
immediately ejected out of the hydrophobic core, shifting the equilibrium
toward the forward direction. On the other hand, the catalyst, which
is a dynamic combination of Cu(II)/Cu(I), is generated in situ in
the reaction mixture by mixing CuSO4 with sodium ascorbate
and reacts with alkyne to produce copper acetylide. This species undergoes
a facile 5-exo-dig cycloisomerization with the intermediate
condensation products of 2-aminopyridines and aromatic aldehydes to
afford a large variety of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
via a 1,3-hydride shift.

Scheme 2 Plausible Mechanistic Pathway
Inspired by the recent reports
of Gevorgyan and Chernyak,9a,9h our methodology was
successfully extended to synthesize a small
library of 2-(aryl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)acetates
(5a–k) by the reactions of 2-aminopyridines (1) and aromatic aldehydes (2) with ethyl propiolates
(3b) (Table 3). The desired product (5) was obtained in moderate
to good yields after 8–14 h of stirring at 50 °C. It was
found that substituents in the aromatic ring of the aldehydes hardly
have any effect in terms of rate of reaction or yield of the product
(Table 3, 5b–f). A similar trend was observed in variation of substituents in the
2-aminopyridine residue (Table 3, 5g–k). However, the yield of product 5 is, in general, less than imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines derived from phenylacetylene (4).

a All yields refer
to an isolated
product.

Next, we paid attention
on utilizing the reaction media for subsequent
reactions from the perspective of atom economy in a chemical process.
As the surfactants are highly soluble in water and the products can
be simply extracted by organic solvents, a study was conducted to
reuse the reaction media for the next cycles using our model substrates
(see the Supporting Information, Table
S1). It was observed that the reaction media can be reused up to the
third cycle without addition of surfactants with no change in yields
and minor difference in reaction time. However, concentration of the
active catalyst diminishes significantly after each cycle as 10 mol
% catalyst loading was mandatory to achieve similar yield as the first
cycle (Supporting Information, Table S1,
entry 4). It was observed that some brown-black particles precipitated
out from the aqueous reaction media after extraction of the crude
product with organic solvent, which was isolated and characterized
as Cu(0) nanoparticles by X-ray diffraction-analysis (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Atomic absorption
spectroscopy (AAS) studies also revealed reduced copper level in the
aqueous reaction media after the work-up, indicating the requirement
of a fresh batch of CuSO4–NaOAs to achieve similar
efficiency of the catalytic process (Supporting Information, Table S2). The present method was compared with
available domino A3-coupling methods for the synthesis
of 2,3-disubstituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in conventional
media9 and “green” media,14 and their E-factors were calculated
based on a common reaction (Supporting Information, Table S3). As expected, the present method was found to have lower
a E-factor than all conventional methods and several
“green” methods. It is noteworthy to mention that the
present method uses mild heating (50 °C) to achieve the final
product in good yields, whereas other available methods generally
use refluxing conditions.9 A scale-up reaction
was also conducted in gram scale using 2-aminopyridine (1a, 20 mmol), benzaldehyde (2a, 20 mmol), and phenylacetylene
(3a, 24 mmol), and it was observed that the yield and
reaction time remain similar (yield 87%; time 6 h), indicating that
these reactions can be conducted on large scales.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a highly efficient and versatile
method for the synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
derivatives by Cu(II)–ascorbate-catalyzed domino A3-coupling reaction in aqueous micellar media. Presumably, a dynamic
combination of Cu(II)/Cu(I), generated in situ by the reaction of
CuSO4 with sodium ascorbate, catalyzes a facile 5-exo-dig cycloisomerization of alkynes with the condensation
products of 2-aminopyridines and aromatic aldehydes. The methodology
works well with aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic aldehydes.
The method can tolerate both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
substituents on 2-aminopyridine and benzaldehyde derivatives to afford
the desired products in good overall yields. As the products can be
simply extracted in an organic layer, the aqueous part containing
the surfactant can be reused for further reactions with the addition
of a fresh batch of CuSO4–NaOAs. A scale-up reaction
demonstrates that the methodology can be applied in gram-scale without
any significant difference in yield and reaction time. The current
methodology is superior to existing methods because of the simple
experimental setup, use of water as “green” media, mild
condition, inexpensive catalyst, and high yields.

(254 or 365 nm) for visualization. Column chromatography was performed
using 60–120 mesh silica gel. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE (400 MHz) with tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per
million (δ) units. Standard abbreviations are used for representing
multiplicity of NMR peaks. HRMS spectra were recorded on Q-TOF LC–MS
(6545 Q-TOF LC–MS, Agilent) using ESI as the ion source. IR
spectra were recorded in KBr pellets with IR Affinity 1, Shimadzu.
Particulate Systems NanoPlus zeta/nanoparticle analyzer was used for
the DLS study. Olympus IX51 optical microscope was used for capturing

spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
In
a 10 mL round bottom flask, SDS (10 mol %)
was added in 2 mL water and the solution was vigorously stirred for
5 min. Then, 2-aminopyridine derivative (1, 1 mmol),
aldehyde (2, 1 mmol), CuSO4·5H2O (10 mol %), and sodium ascorbate (20 mol %) were added to the reaction
mixture, followed by the addition of the alkyne derivative (1.2 mmol).
The reaction mixture was then stirred at 50 °C for 6–16
h, and progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC after each hour.
The crude products were extracted from the aqueous phase by ethyl
acetate (2 × 10 mL), washed with brine, dried over anhydrous
sodium sulphate, and concentrated in vacuum to afford the crude imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivative. The crude product was purified by
column chromatography (silica gel, 60–120 mesh) using ethyl
acetate–petroleum ether as the eluent.
