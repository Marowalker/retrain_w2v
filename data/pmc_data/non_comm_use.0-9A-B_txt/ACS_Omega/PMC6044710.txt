The redox behavior
of proteins plays a crucial part in the design
of bioelectronic systems. We have demonstrated several functional
systems exploiting the electron exchange properties of the redox protein
cytochrome c (cyt c) in combination
with enzymes and photoactive proteins. The operation is based on an
effective reaction at modified electrodes but also to a large extent
on the capability of self-exchange between cyt c molecules
in a surface-fixed state. In this context, different variants of human
cyt c have been examined here with respect to an
altered heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) rate in a monolayer on
electrodes as well as an enhanced self-exchange rate while being incorporated
in multilayer architectures. For this purpose, mutants of the wild-type
(WT) protein have been prepared to change the chemical nature of the
surface contact area near the heme edge. The structural integrity
of the variants has been verified by NMR and UV–vis measurements.
It is shown that the single-point mutations can significantly influence
the heterogeneous ET rate at thiol-modified gold electrodes and that
electroactive protein/silica nanoparticle multilayers can be constructed
with all forms of human cyt c prepared. The kinetic
behavior of electron exchange for the mutant proteins in comparison
with that of the WT has been found altered in some multilayer arrangements.
Higher self-exchange rates have been found for K79A. The results demonstrate
that the position of the introduced change in the charge situation
of cyt c has a profound influence on the exchange
behavior. In addition, the behavior of the cyt c variants
in assembled multilayers is found to be rather similar to the situation
of cyt c self-exchange in solution verified by NMR.

Introduction
Immobilization of redox
proteins on electrodes has received rising
notice over the last two decades from both elementary and practical
points of view. The specific characteristics of proteins and enzymes
such as molecular recognition, redox properties, and catalytic features
provide a profound basis for the development of bioelectronic devices
such as biofuel cells and biosensors.1,2 Redox proteins
have gained considerable attention with this respect; their use originates
to a large extend from specific reactions with biomolecular interaction
partners but also with small molecules involved in oxidative stress
such as hydrogen peroxide,3,4 superoxide,5−7 or nitric oxide.8 Examples are myoglobin,3 hemoglobin,4 azurin,7 cytochrome c′ (prime)
(cyt c′),8 cytochrome c (cyt c).5,6

In this
regard, mitochondrial cyt c has been extensively
used as a model redox protein due to the stability and availability
of this well-characterized soluble heme protein.9 Several routes have been designed to constitute cyt c monolayers on different electrodes with variable performance.10−13 For metal electrodes, often self-assembly monolayers (SAM) are used
for modification. Cyt c can be electrostatically
assembled, for example, on carboxy-terminated alkanethiols and/or
can also be covalently coupled.14 Furthermore,
it has been demonstrated that the immobilized redox protein can be
reduced by superoxide radicals, whereupon the protein is reoxidized
by the electrode, resulting in a current that is proportional to the
radical concentration.15−19 The performance of such a sensing system can be improved by increasing
the protein concentration by means of protein multilayers.20

Multilayer architectures of the redox
protein can be prepared through
the layer-by-layer deposition of cyt c and different
kinds of second building blocks, such as polyelectrolytes,21 DNA,22 gold,23 and silica nanoparticles (SiNPs).24

Communication within such architectures,
however, is a vital issue,
as the electron transfer (ET) pathways in the assemblies significantly
increase with the number of deposited layers.25 It has been shown that ET in the multilayer systems occurs through
protein–protein electron self-exchange among the cyt c molecules.21,26 Charge transfer proceeds thus
by an electron hopping process among the heme centers confined in
a protein shell (with many positive charges at neutral pH27). This mechanism may require some rotational
flexibility of the cyt c molecules embedded in the
multilayer architecture.

A further advanced stage is shown by
embedding additional biomolecules,
such as enzymes, into cyt c multilayers to create
artificial biprotein signal chains.2,17,28−30 Cyt c operates
in these systems as a solid-state ET protein, facilitating ET between
the enzyme and the electrode without any external mediator. It has
been shown that the reaction at the enzyme becomes the rate-determining
step at low scan rates. However, it was also found that at higher
scan rates the supply or withdrawal of electrons to or from the enzyme
becomes important indicating limitations by the protein–protein
exchange.17 One approach for examining
alterations in the protein self-exchange reaction rate can be seen
in protein engineering. NMR is a valuable method for analyzing self-exchange
rates and thus has been often used for evaluating exchange reactions
among redox proteins in solution.31−35

Mutational studies of ET proteins have been
utilized to understand
the reaction with other biomolecules or to locate protein interaction
sites. Previously, it has been shown that mutations of cyt c can affect the reaction with enzymes, for example, the
reaction with cyt c oxidase.36 Furthermore, superoxide sensors have been constructed on the basis
of human cyt c mutants, showing that the sensitivity
can be increased due to the raised reaction rate with the oxygen radical
by means of amino acid exchange.37

Here, we examine different variants of human cyt c in which a positively charged lysine residue is replaced by a neutral
alanine residue with respect to the protein–protein self-exchange
reaction rate (kex) and the electrochemical
behavior in an artificial SiNP-based multilayer matrix on modified
gold electrodes. The investigation is dedicated to gain a more profound
understanding of factors influencing the ET inside multilayer architectures,
which are based on direct electron exchange between immobilized protein
molecules. The primary focus is on chasing mutation points by which
the self-exchange kinetics of cyt c can be enhanced
and thus providing a path to use these ET relays for improved electrochemical
communication with biocatalysts in a multilayer system.

Results and Discussion
In the present work, the self-exchange reaction and the electrochemical
behavior of five human cyt c mutants have been investigated
in different SAM/cyt c-[cyt c·SiNPs]4–6 multilayer architectures on gold electrodes by cyclic
voltammetry (CV), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and in solution
by NMR. This approach allows, on the one hand, a monitoring of the
electrochemical behavior (by CV) and of the binding properties of
the different mutants on a surface (via SPR); on the other hand, it
correlates these findings with the structural properties of the mutants
and the self-exchange in solution (measured by NMR).

Choice and Assessment of
Human Cyt c Mutants
We choose human cyt c to investigate the influence
of amino acid residue modifications and to alter the protein–protein
self-exchange reaction rate in a SiNP-based multilayer matrix. This
analysis is based on reports showing that lowering net charges in
cyt c can lead to increased electron self-exchange
rates38,40 and that the introduction of additional
positively charged lysines close to the heme pocket leads to a decreased kex.39

In general,
ET reactions between biomolecules in solution require protein association
followed by an ET. The value of the protein–protein association
rate constant (kon), which is determined
by long-range association forces, can be augmented by favorable electrostatic
interactions such as complementary charge distribution on the binding
partners.41 A fast ET requires the formation
of a highly specific productive complex, often in conjunction with
a low-specificity encounter state.42 The
encounter state has a transient and highly dynamic nature because
it consists of an ensemble of interconverting relative orientations
of the partner molecules. From the encounter state, the number of
short-range interactions between the redox partners is increased to
form the stereospecific state corresponding to the productive complex.43 For the formation of a productive complex, van
der Waals interactions also play a relevant role, as observed, for
example, for the interaction between cyt c and cyt c oxidase.44,45

In functional redox complexes
involving cyt c,
two critical interaction areas can be identified: (1) a central one,
which involves hydrophobic residues and accounts for the most stable
interaction, which is encased by (2) a ring of charged residues (mainly
lysines) that give rise to transient interactions, switching on and
off electrostatic salt bridges with different carboxylate residues
on the facing partner; these interconverting salt bridges are the
basis of the multiple conformations of the encounter complex. Single-point
mutations at the interface can shift the equilibrium involving the
formation of encounter and productive complexes. It is reasonable
to assume that similar mechanisms could apply in self-exchange ET
complexes, as in the present case—not only in solution, but
also when cyt c is in a quasi-immobilized state.
Taking these aspects into account, five positively charged residues
have been selected to be replaced with neutral alanine: Lys13Ala,
Lys27Ala, Lys72Ala, Lys73Ala, Lys79Ala. In Figure 1, all of the chosen single-point mutations
at the cyt c molecule are depicted. The chosen Lys
mutation positions are surface exposed and solely located on one side
of cyt c with respect to the heme edge.

UV–Vis and NMR Spectroscopic
Characterization of Human
Cyt c
UV–vis absorption spectra of
WT and variants of human cyt c in its reduced form
are shown in Figure S1. Virtually all of
the investigated variants display their absorption maximums in the
reduced state (Soret, α, and β band) at similar wavelengths
compared to the WT protein. In the oxidized state, the absorption
maxima of the γ band of the mutants are also comparable to those
of WT cyt c (Table 1).

The coordination
state of the ferric form of WT cyt c and its variants
has been inspected by paramagnetic monodimensional 1H NMR
over large spectral widths. The well-resolved hyperfine-shifted
resonances of the cyt c heme methyls, 8-CH3 and 3-CH3, and of the axial ligands for the iron atom
(His18, Hδ2, and Met80 ε-CH3) are diagnostic
for the electronic properties of the ferric heme center in cyt c and are used as a fingerprint to assure the integrity of the heme environment for all
cyt c mutants (Figure 2).46,47 Resonance position and line widths
are very similar in the WT and mutant proteins, pointing to a conserved
low-spin ferric heme center with intact coordination. This is clearly
apparent from the comparison reported in Figure 2 for the variants pinpointed by electrochemical
analysis (vide infra). 1H–15N heteronuclear
single-quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments acquired for both oxidation
states of some variants (data not shown) prove the intact fold. Indeed,
the HSQC maps for the WT, K73A, and K79A variants in both ferric and
ferrous forms are essentially superimposable, besides small chemical
shift perturbations localized in the immediate surroundings of the
mutation sites.

of the heme substituents and axial ligands.

Determination of the Electrochemical Properties of Human Cyt c Variants in a Monolayer Arrangement
It has been
examined whether the different cyt c forms can be
stably adsorbed on a thiol-modified Au electrode (mercaptoundecanoic
acid/mercaptoundecanol (MUA/MU) is used here because of fast ET for
cyt c).20 To examine the
electrochemical properties and for calculation of the heterogeneous
ET rate constant (ks) and the redox potentials,
CV has been carried out at different scan rates. It has been found
that the CVs of the mutant proteins are rather comparable to those
of WT cyt c (Figure S2). The collected data in terms of redox potentials and heterogeneous
ET rate constants (ks) are given in Table 2.

a All values are
evaluated as the
average value of at least three electrodes. Formal potentials (Ef) were evaluated by the use of an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode with 1 M KCl.

For the investigated mutants, only small variations in the redox
potential have been observed in the adsorbed state. Representative
CVs of the WT cyt c and mutant K79A are shown in Figure 3. The formal redox
potentials (Ef) of K13A and K27A are about
15 mV lower than those for the WT protein. In contrast, K79A displays
an Ef that is 15 mV higher compared with
that of WT cyt c, indicating that the change in the
overall net charge has no significant effect on the Ef value.

human recombinant
cyt c adsorbed on an MUA/MU-modified gold electrode
(5 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 at a scan rate of 100 mV/s).

Concerning the electroactive cyt c amount (surface
coverage Γ) found for the cyt c monolayer-modified
gold electrodes, a rather uniform behavior has been determined with
values varying between 12 and 15 pmol/cm2. Only the mutant
K79A displays a slightly lower value. It can be concluded that the
reduction in surface charge does not significantly alter the interaction
with the negatively charged thiol layer on the electrode—an
observation that has also been verified by SPR measurements. Here,
cyt c is assembled on a planar MUA/MU-modified SPR-Chip
to examine the mass deposition during the adsorption process in a
flow system. A clear mass deposition from low ionic strength buffer
can be found for the tested proteins. The resulting concentration-dependent
mass accumulation for the WT and selected protein variants is given
in Figure S6. The human WT protein and
the investigated mutants display rather similar mass deposition during
the assembly step, confirming the data gained during the CV investigations.

A different behavior for some of the mutants can be observed for
the ks values. Among the Lys-substituted
variants, K73A (ks = 95 ± 3 s–1) displays a clear increase of the ET rate in comparison
with that of the WT (ks = 78 ± 6
s–1). The clearly enhanced reaction rate for K73A
might be due to the reduction of the positive charges close to the
heme edge and thereby to an improved orientation on the electrode
surface. In contrast, mutant K27A (ks =
30 ± 2 s–1) shows a drop in the ET rate and
a slightly expanded half-peak width (105 mV), which may arise from
a different docking behavior of the protein with the electrode surface

Multilayers with Different Forms of Human Cyt c
The sufficiently high rate constants for the heterogeneous
ET (ks) of the cyt c variants
with the electrode and the rather unaltered assembly behavior (surface
coverage, Γ) on the negatively charged MU/MUA surface provide
the basis to study the different cyt c variants in
a multilayer architecture. Here, SiNPs are used as a second building
block to obtain defined cyt c multilayers by the
layer-by-layer approach. The multilayer formation is based on the
electrostatic interactions among the negatively charged SiNPs (with
grafted carboxylic acid groups) and the positively charged cyt c and can be verified electrochemically but also by SPR
and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. Electroactive multilayer
electrodes have been constructed for all variants; their structure
and the ET steps are schematically shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Schematic representation of an Au–MUA/MU–cyt c[SiNPs·cyt c]4-multilayer-coated
electrode and the essential ET steps (yellow arrows).

The functional properties have been analyzed by
CV. Representative
CVs measured for a monolayer electrode and for a four-bilayer electrode
of WT cyt c and SiNPs are given in Figure 5. Oxidation and reduction peaks
increase with the number of layers, indicating that cyt c molecules in the external layers are also electrically communicating
with the electrode. Several ET steps must be considered for this electrode
architecture (Figure 4): (1) the heterogeneous ET from the Au electrode through the SAM-layer
to the cyt c monolayer (ks) and then (2) to the cyt c molecules of the consecutive
layers. The adjacent steps occur by interprotein ET among the cyt c molecules (self-exchange, kex), thus allowing electron transport through the architecture, whereas
SiNPs are just a stabilizing matrix compound, as they are nonconductive.

(B) WT cyt c monolayer and (A) four-bilayer
electrode, with WT cyt c and SiNPs in each layer.
The cyt c monolayer and the four-bilayer electrode
were assembled on a SAM-modified Au electrode. Scan rate 100 mV/s,
5 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.

A closer examination of the transfer steps can be performed
by
a kinetic analysis with a systematic scan rate variation for all proteins
in a four- and six-bilayer arrangement. The resulting CVs of four-bilayer
electrodes for WT cyt c and the mutants K13A, K27A,
K72A, K723A, and K79A at different scan rates are shown in Figure S3, specifying the different electrochemical
behavior of the cyt c variants in a multilayer arrangement.
For all investigated cyt c electrodes, an increased
peak separation with increasing scan rate can be shown, which reflects
the rising kinetic limitations of the system. The formal redox potentials
of the cyt c variants in the multilayer architecture
differ insignificantly from each other. From the analysis of the voltammetric
peaks, it can be seen that the amount of electrode-addressable cyt c decreases significantly at higher scan rates for all proteins.
Evidently, the scan rate becomes too fast at this point, thus not
all cyt c molecules within the architecture can be
converted during the period of the voltammetric scan. By quantifying
the peak area (of CVs), the electroactive surface coverage Γ
values can be calculated at different scan rates and are given in Figure 6a, indicating that
each cyt c form has a different kinetic behavior.

Figure 6 Electroactive
surface coverage Γ of four-bilayer electrodes
with the different cyt c forms as a function of different
scan rates (10–300 mV/s). Potassium phosphate buffer 5 mM,
pH 7.0. (A) Absolute surface coverage Γ for the different cyt c multilayer electrodes, and (B) relative change of surface
concentration by normalization to the value at 10 mV/s.

The differences become even more obvious when the
relative change
of the electroactive amount with the scan rate is analyzed, as shown
in Figure 6b. By analyzing
the decrease in electroactive (addressable) cyt c, one can define a scan rate at which 80% of the starting value (at
10 mV/s) can be voltammetrically addressed. This v80% value
can be seen as a qualitative tracer for the different protein behavior.
Clearly, for the mutant K79A this value is larger (v80% = 300 mV/s) than it is for the WT (v80% = 100 mV/s),
whereas K73A shows a much smaller value (v80% = 20 mV/s).
This suggests that the K79A mutant undergoes a more efficient interprotein
electron exchange than the WT protein. Although the driving force
is rapidly changed, a large portion of the cyt c molecules
in the multilayer system can still follow and is addressable by the
electrode. In contrast, the mutation at position K73A does not show
an enhanced self-exchange rate. For the K13A, K27A, and K72A mutants,
a rather similar behavior as for the WT protein has been found on
the electrode. By comparing the scan rate variation of the six-bilayer
electrodes (Figure S4) with that of the
four-bilayer ones, it can be stated that the drop in addressable cyt c during the scan rate variation agrees to a large extent
for the two types of multilayer electrodes. Again, the K79A mutant
displays the smallest decrease in addressable cyt c amount, followed by WT, K13A, K27A, and K72A; the largest decrease
is exhibited by K73A.

To elucidate that the ET from the electrode
to the monolayer (step
1 in Figure 4) is not
the limiting step, the ks values of the
cyt c monolayer electrodes have to be taken into
account. As shown in Table 2, no major decrease has been observed; rather, improved or
equivalent ks values have been found for
the mutants by cyclic voltammetric investigations (except K27A displaying
a lower ks). Thus, the different behavior
in multiple layers can clearly be attributed to a variation in the
self-exchange rate of the proteins K79A and K73A.

Estimation
and Evaluation of Self-Exchange Rate Constants (kex) in Multilayer Arrangements
For
further insights into the self-exchange process, the most intriguing
mutants have been selected for further analysis, on the basis of their
scan rate behavior (CV), reported in Figure 6. Alongside the WT protein, a mutant with
a less pronounced decrease in surface coverage Γ (K79A) and
a mutant with a more pronounced decrease in Γ (K73A) have been
chosen for determination of the interprotein ET and self-exchange
(kex) in the multilayer architecture.

To achieve an assessment of the self-exchange rate constant (kex) for the selected cyt c variants
in the investigated multilayer architectures, the Dahms–Ruff
equation has been applied.48−50 Therefore, an intermolecular
electron hopping process among the cyt c molecules
in the multilayer architecture has been assumed. The Randles–Sevcik
equation51 has been used to calculate the
effective diffusion coefficient, Deffective, by evaluating the peak currents at different scan rates. For human
WT cyt c, a Deffective of 1.0 × 10–11 cm2 s–1, for K73A a value of 3.8 × 10–12 cm2 s–1, and for K79A a value of 1.3 × 10–11 cm2 s–1 has been obtained.
The approximate distance between the adjoining redox centers, δ,
is estimated to be 2.6 nm, and for all multilayer systems an average
cyt c concentration of 34 mM is used. By means of
these values, subsequently, the self-exchange rate constants (kex) for the cyt c variants
are calculated: WT 2.7 × 104 M–1 s–1, K79A 3.3 × 104 M–1 s–1, and K73A 9.9 × 103 M–1 s–1 (see Table 3).

b Deffective is calculated
according to the Randles–Sevcik equation and
given as cm2 s–1.

c kex is
calculated according to the Dahms–Ruff equation and given as

It needs to be mentioned that the applied model is
based on the
idea of hopping electrons among the heme sites of the adjacent cyt c molecules, and not assuming diffusing cyt c molecules, as the cyt c molecules are immobilized
in the multilayer architecture. The observed changes in kex are defined in the following order of efficiency of
the self-exchange reaction: K79A > WT ≫ K73A. This is also
in good agreement with the qualitative analysis obtained by the v80% values.

Despite the presumed high ionic strength52 inside the multilayer architecture owing to
the negatively charged
SiNPs, the calculated values appear rather high. This might be explained
by the high amount of protein deposited on the electrode and by the
residual rotational flexibility of the cyt c molecules
inside the multilayers. In addition, the local cyt c concentration may also be affected by the specific cyt c variant embedded in the layered architecture. Given that a precise
determination is not feasible, an equal cyt c concentration
within the investigated protein multilayer electrodes has been assumed
for our calculations.

The increased self-exchange rate for cyt c mutant
K79A and the decreased self-exchange rate for K73A in comparison with
that of the WT protein demonstrate the presence of key protein–protein
interactions that modulate the ET process and thus the kex. The different location of the mutated Lys residues
on the protein surface provides hints about the position of hot spots
for the formation of productive protein–protein complexes.
As a consequence, the analyzed variants modulate the
protein recognition process unequally, from the unaltered effect induced
by K13A, K27A, and K72A to the significant changes of opposite sign
for K79A and K73A.

NMR Measurement of Self-Exchange Rate Constants
(kex) in Solution
Electron self-exchange
rates
in solution have also been evaluated by NMR for three selected proteins
(WT, K73A, and K79A). The 1H–15N HSQC
spectra obtained on samples with almost equimolar mixtures of the
two redox states contain two HN amide peaks (NoxHox and NredHred) for each residue, as shown in Figure S5, top panel. In the 1H–15N HSQC-15N exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) experiment,
for each amide group two additional peaks are detected, that is, the
exchange peaks NoxHred and NredHox. (Figure S5, bottom panels).
Using molar fractions and peak intensities, a qualitative analysis
is possible, as described in the Materials and Methods section, and self-exchange rate constants for the WT cyt c and its variants (K73A, K79A) can be determined. The kex values in solution measured by NMR are smaller
than those measured in the multilayer structure. However, their relative
values follow the same order of efficiency of the self-exchange reaction:
K79A > WT ≫ K73A. The kex values
obtained in solution and in multilayer arrangements are summarized
in Table 3.

The
two variants K79A and K73A are reasonably affected to a similar extent
upon replacement of a surface Lys with an Ala, when considering long-range
electrostatic effects. At variance, both methodologies identify an
increased kex (with respect to WT) for
K79A and a decreased one for K73A, which should be driven by local
contacts.

The protein–protein contacts between the cyt c molecules that give rise to electron self-exchange are
not known.
A reasonable model for what happens in the immobilized state could
be provided by the molecular contacts observed in the crystal structure
of human cyt c (PDB 3ZCF), which contains four molecules in the
unit cell.53 Although a crystal structure
cannot verify ET pathways, it can give valuable hints. Interestingly,
recent studies have shown that in calixarene-supported cyt c crystals ET between fixed redox sites is feasible.54

It is apparent from the above-mentioned
crystal structure that
K79A and K73A are both located in the interaction surface area. K73A
displays a high heterogeneous ET rate but a reduced self-exchange
rate. Therefore it seems reasonable to propose that altering the nature
of the amino acid at this position hinders the ability of the protein
to give rise to self-exchange reactions. The differences in ks and kex between
K79A and WT are less pronounced but point to a decreased ks and increased kex, suggesting
that the replacement with an Ala at this position facilitates the
formation of a productive self-exchange ET complex.

This study
shows that there is no simple correlation between the
heterogeneous ET rate of cyt c at a thiol-modified
gold electrode and the self-exchange properties of cyt c within a complex multilayer system. This is not only the case for
the K79A and K73A variants but also for K27A, wherein unaltered exchange
behavior is found in multiple layers, but a decreased reaction rate
is observed at the electrode. Furthermore, the correlation between
the cyt c self-exchange behavior in solution and
in a multilayer assembly points to a comparable situation for the
investigated proteins in these situations and may support the idea
of rotational flexibility of the variants in the adsorbed state.

Conclusions
Different variants of human cyt c have been examined
regarding their heterogeneous ET rate constant (ks) adsorbed in a monolayer state on a thiol-modified gold
electrode and their self-exchange rate constant (kex) incorporated in a multilayer assembly. The latter
has importance as a basic platform to integrate and connect different
enzymes with electrodes.

For this purpose, five mutants of the
human WT protein have been
chosen with a focus on their surface electrostatic properties by replacing
a lysine residue with an alanine (K13A, K27A, K72A, K73A, and K79A).
It has been shown that single-point mutations in the human forms of
cyt c can significantly influence the heterogeneous
ET (ks) with MU/MUA-modified gold electrodes.
Here, K73A results in higher and K27A in lower ks values in comparison with those of the human WT cyt c and the other protein variants.

It is further demonstrated
that electroactive protein multilayers
can be constructed with all mutant forms of human cyt c investigated here. The amount of immobilized protein by the layer-by-layer
approach is found to be not highly dependent on the protein variant
used. However, the kinetic behavior of the voltammetric signals is
different. Whereas the K79A mutant shows an enhanced electron exchange
rate compared with that of the WT (and K13A, K27A, and K72A), K73A
displays a reduced self-exchange. This behavior has been verified
with multilayer electrodes with different number of layers. The same
trend (K79A > WT > K73A) has been observed by measuring self-exchange
rates in solution by NMR. The K79A variant, which has the largest
increase in kex and the largest formal
redox potential, is the one with the mutation site closer to the heme.
These experiments provide emerging evidence that the simple reduction
in surface charge is not the only determinant for an altered self-exchange
of the variants and that the specific location of the residues on
the protein surface drives the process.

Altogether, three different
determinants can be specified that
affect the electrochemical properties of cyt c in
a redox-active multilayer architecture: (1) the amount of electrochemically
addressable cyt c molecules per layer that can be
deposited on the electrode, (2) the cyt c self-exchange
rate (kex), and (3) the heterogeneous
rate constant (ks) for the ET with the
electrode. The study demonstrates that cyt c self-exchange
can be a valuable tool for constructing complex and functional protein
electrodes. It shows that the application of a protein variant with
an enhanced self-exchange rate can improve the kinetic behavior of
cyt c-based multilayer architectures allowing a faster
electron transport through multiple protein layers on electrodes.
This may also have prospects for an improved connection of enzymes
to electrodes through multiple layers of cyt c.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Potassium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen,
Germany), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4),
potassium chloride (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), gold-wire electrodes,
diameter of 0.5 mm (Goodfellow, Bad Nauheim, Germany), 11-mercapto-1-undecanoic
acid, 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany).

Buffers
K2HPO4 and KH2PO4 were used for preparation of the potassium phosphate
buffer (5 mM, pH 7.0); the pH was adjusted with phosphoric acid or
potassium hydroxide.

SiNPs
The SiNPs were synthesized
and characterized
according to a well-established synthesis protocol.24

Protein Mutant Preparation (Mutation of Human
Cyt c)
The pET21a-CCHLhCYC plasmid (for
the human cyt c gene) was provided by Chuang.55 The pET21a-CCHLhCYC plasmid was used to introduce
mutations (referred
to as WT). The Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene,
La Jolla) was used to introduce mutations according to the provided
protocol. The mutations were confirmed by gene sequencing.

Purification/Expression
of Recombinant WT and Mutated Human
Cyt c
For the purification and expression
of human cyt c, previous protocols were adapted.55,56 Human cyt c was coexpressed with cyt c maturation and hemelyase. Transformation of the plasmid DNA (mutated
cyt c gene) was realized by the use of BL21- (DE3)C41 Escherichia coli cells.57 Cultivation of the these cells was carried out in minimal M9 media
(addition of vitamins, minerals, and glycerol) at 37 °C, 180
rpm. Expression was initialized by addition of FeSO4 (100
mg/L) and IPTG (1 mM). The culture was incubated at 30 °C (60
rpm) for 72 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysated
with lysozyme and sonication. Two chromatography steps were needed
to purify cyt c. In the first step, the supernatant
(lysate) was separated by the use of an SP Sepharose cationic exchange
column (GE Healthcare, Sweden). The protein was eluted with NaCl (linear
gradient, 0–500 mM, in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM), pH
6.8). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was
applied to analyze the collected protein fractions. The ones containing
cyt c were further used, and an ultracentrifugal
filter (Mw cutoff of 5000 kDa; Amicon;
Millipore) was used to concentrate them. Afterward, the concentrate
sample was further purified with: Hi Load 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade
column (GE Healthcare, Sweden), sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM), pH
6.8.

Spectrophotometric Investigations
Spectrophotometric
measurements were carried out with a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(UV-250 1PC, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Kyoto, Japan). Spectrums
were recorded between 350 and 650 nm (cyt c conc.
5 μM). For oxidizing cyt c, ferricyanide was
used, and for reducing cyt c, dithiothreitol (DTT)
was used. The protein samples were also dialyzed (50 mM sodium phosphate,
pH 7.5, Slide-A-Lyzer dialyses cassettes; Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL, Mw cutoff = 3500 kDa).

SPR Experiments
To investigate the adsorption process
of the cyt c variants on a SAM-modified Au electrode,
Biacore X and T100 (Biacore AB, Sweden) were used. The SPR-Au chip
was cleaned according to an already established protocol. Briefly,
the Au chip was incubated for 10 min in a H2SO4/H2O2 (3:1) solution. Afterward, the SAM-layer
formation was initiated by incubation of the Au chip for 48 h in a
MUA/MU-solution (1:3; 5 mM). Cyt c solutions were
flushed over the SAM-modified chip with a flow rate of 1 μL/min.

NMR Experiments
Unlabeled and 15N-labeled
cyt c were used for NMR studies, in its paramagnetic
ferric and diamagnetic ferrous form. For oxidizing cyt c, ferricyanide was used, and for reducing cyt c DTT
was used. By means of ultrafiltration, the oxidizing agent was removed
ahead of NMR measurements. The protein samples (0.7 mM) were concentrated
with a Centricon centrifugal filter (Mw cutoff = 5000 Da), phosphate buffer (50 mM), pH 6.8, 10% D2O. For the electron self-exchange measurements, the required oxidized/reduced
ratio was preserved by addition of DTT in stoichiometric amounts.
A Bruker Avance Spectrometer (16.4 T, 700 MHz) was used for the NMR
investigations. Ferric cyt c undergoes autoreduction
of the heme iron in solution.58 To maintain
the selected oxidized/reduced ratio through the experiments, electron
self-exchange measurements were conducted at 289 K. Four sets of experiments
were recorded for each sample. For detection of the diamagnetic part,
the 1D 1H NMR spectrum was recorded (spectral width = 20
ppm, 2.0 s recycle delay). To detect the hyperfine-shifted signals
in the ferric form (cyt c variants) a spectral width
of 100 ppm was used in combination with faster repetition rates of
800 ms. Two-dimensional (2D) 1H–15N HSQC
experiments were performed with 2048 × 200 data points, a spectral
width of 15 ppm for 1H, and 40 ppm for 15N.
Self-exchange rates were measured with the 1H–15N HSQC–15N EXSY pulse sequence.33 For calculation of the self-exchange rate constants,
the following equation was used  In this equation, Vox and Vred are
the volumes of oxidized
and reduced self-peaks, and Vred-ox and Vox-red are the volumes of
the two connecting exchange peaks; their values are derived upon integration
of resolved sets of signals in the 1H–15N HSQC–15N EXSY. The molar ratios of oxidized and
reduced cyt c forms (fox and fred, respectively) were measured
from the relative intensity of peaks that correspond to the same amino
acid in the two redox forms of the protein in the 1H–15N HSQC maps. τm is the mixing time in the
EXSY experiment. The self-exchange rate constant, kex, is the only parameter to be fitted and can be calculated
from the above equation.

Construction of the Cyt c Mono- and Multilayer
Electrodes
The gold-wire electrodes were cleaned and SAM-modified
according a well-established protocol.28 Cyt c monolayer and multilayer electrodes were
prepared according an already published protocol.24

Electrochemical Investigations
Electrochemical
measurements
were performed with a CHI-660E potentiostat (CHI Instruments, Austin,
TX). A custom-made cell (1 mL) was used for the electrochemical investigations.
A platinum electrode was used as counter electrode, and as reference
electrode an Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) with a potential of +0.237 V versus
NHE (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) was used. The electrochemical
properties of the cyt c mono- and multilayer electrodes
by CV were recorded between −350 and +350 mV (vs Ag/AgCl; scan
rate = 100 mV/s). A scan rate variation (between 10 mV/s and 15 V/s)
was performed to assess the heterogeneous ET rate constant, ks, for the cyt c monolayer
electrodes. The resulting peak separation was evaluated by applying
the Laviron method.59 The self-exchange
rate constants, kex, for the multilayer
electrodes were assessed by a scan rate variation (10 mV/s to 15 V/s)
and evaluated according to the Dahms–Ruff equation.48−50 The Randles–Sevcik equation51 was
used to calculate (peak currents at different scan rates) the diffusion
coefficients. The redox-active cyt c surface coverage
(Γ) was analyzed (applying Faraday’s law) by using the
average of the peak area (oxidation and reduction charge). Half-peak
width and charge were evaluated with the CHI software.
