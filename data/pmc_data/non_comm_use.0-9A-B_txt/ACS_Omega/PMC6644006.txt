In
this article, we have performed an all-atom molecular dynamics
simulation study to investigate the influence of water on the molecular
level arrangement of reline deep eutectic solvent for different hydration
levels ranging from 3.4 to 58.1 wt % of water and complemented the
observations of recently measured neutron scattering experimental
data. This study is particularly important because water is being
introduced as a second hydrogen bond donor/acceptor in reline, wherein
the structure is primarily governed by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic
interactions. We have analyzed the simulated X-ray scattering structure
functions, their partial components, and hydrogen bonding interactions
to understand the effects of water on various intermolecular interactions
in reline–water mixtures. It is observed that at lower hydration
level, reline structure is qualitatively retained. At higher hydration
level, most water molecules preferentially solvate chloride anions
and ammonium group of choline cations mostly impacting choline–choline,
choline–chloride, and chloride–chloride interactions.
The present study reveals that at and above 41 wt % of water, the
molecular arrangement of reline drastically changes and set to transition
from reline to an aqueous solution of reline components with further
increase in the hydration level. Hydrogen bond analysis reveals the
presence of strong chloride–water H-bonding interaction, which
gradually replaces choline–chloride and urea–chloride
hydrogen bondings as the hydration level in the mixture increases.

Introduction
Deep eutectic solvents
(DESs) are neoteric solvents that have recently
found more attention as alternative solvents owing to their low toxicity,
environment benign nature, and easy preparation protocol.1−3 Most DESs are obtained by the combination of a salt and one or more
hydrogen bond donor (HBD) species such as urea, malonic acid, ethylene
glycol, and amides in a specific ratio such that the finally obtained
compound has a much lower melting point than its constituting components.4−7 DESs comprised of electrolytes and amides as HBD species have also
been explored recently.8,9 The microscopic structural arrangement
and properties of DESs can be tuned by selection of mixing ratio and
their constituting molecular chemical moieties. This additional degree
of freedom to design DESs with desired properties is encouraging to
use DESs in various fields such as inorganic and organic synthesis,
separation, electrochemistry, extraction, nanomaterials science, and
biotransformations.10−21 DESs are also termed as ionic liquid (IL) analogues as both share
many peculiar properties. In the past, a number of studies have been
performed to investigate structural morphology of pure ILs and IL
+ cosolvents that provide guidance to use these solvents judiciously.22−29 However, such studies are lagging behind in case of DESs. Reline
is an eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea in a 1:2 molar
ratio and is obtained from cheap, naturally occurring, and readily
available starting materials.30 It is a
biodegradable, nontoxic, and economically viable solvent.4,30 It has been used in a number of applications such as biodiesel synthesis,
surface coating, electrodeposition, separation, enzymatic reactions,
and carbon dioxide sequestration.2,16,17,31−35 Because of its ability to donate and accept electrons, reline attains
a high selective solubility for metal–metal oxides and is used
in various metallurgical process.36,37 It is also
used as a solvent in post-etch residue removal.38 Moreover, reline is nonreactive with water and has an acceptable
toxicity profile that enables it to use as a solvent for poorly water
soluble drugs.39 It is widely accepted
that the driving force for the formation of reline is the charge delocalization
because of hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interaction between the chloride
anion and urea. Recent studies based on the neutron diffraction (ND)
experiment, empirical potential structure refinement (EPSR) and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation provide a significant insight into the molecular
level arrangement of different constituting species of reline.7,40,41 These studies support the proposition
that each chloride anion (Cl–) is stabilized by
two urea molecules via H-bonding interaction and to better accommodate
urea within the H-bonded complex, most Cl– anions
are positioned near the hydroxyl group of choline cations (Ch+).

Figure 1 Chemical structure of (a) choline chloride and (b) urea.

In reline, both urea and choline
chloride are hygroscopic in nature,
and it has been observed via experimental and simulation studies that
the presence of little amount of water as a second HBD species not
only changes the macroscopic properties such as density, ionic conductivity,
and viscosity but also disturbs the favorable molecular arrangement
in DES compounds, which eventually curbs their use in various applications.42 Further, the preferred molecular organization
of pure DESs provides an ideal environment for selective catalysis
or nanoparticle synthesis. The presence of water, however, could limit
the use of it in such applications. Therefore, quantification of water
content in DESs is necessary before employing it for any physicochemical
characterization and for any application.

Recently, few experimental42−45 and simulation42,46 studies have been performed
on reline–water mixtures to understand the effect of water
on the physicochemical properties and molecular arrangement of reline
to a certain extent. Shah and Mjalli have performed the experimental
and MD simulation study on aqueous reline and showed that thermophysical
properties such as density, viscosity, melting point, and refractive
index vary gradually with addition of water. Their H-bond analysis
revealed that at low water content, urea–urea and cation–urea
interactions increase but at higher water concentration (beyond >25
wt %), the constituting species of reline are individually hydrated
and show high diffusivity.42

By employing
the neutron scattering experiment, Edler and co-workers44 have shown that the reline microscopic structure
retains up to 42 wt % of water content because of solvophobic sequestration
of water into the nanostructure domains around choline cations. However,
at 51 wt % of water content, the DES structure is disturbed and eventually
leads to transition from reline to an aqueous solution of reline components.44 By using pulsed field gradient NMR diffusion
measurements, D’Agostino and co-workers43 observed that with addition of water, Ch+ cations
diffuse in the Stokesian manner and lead to exchange of the hydroxyl
proton on Ch+. Note that such exchange of proton is technically
not possible to observe in the present MD simulation study. Their
study also indicates that regardless of hydrophilic nature of the
choline chloride salt and HBD species, their aqueous solution forms
inhomogeneous complex mixtures at the microscopic level. By using
Brillouin spectroscopy and 1H NMR, Posada et al. also confirmed
these inhomogeneities despite their fully miscible appearance at the
macroscopic level.45 However, these two
studies differ in the hydration level at which this phase segregation
occurs. Pandey and Pandey47 spectroscopic
study on reline–water proposed the interstitial accommodation
of water within the H-bonded network of reline components. Recently,
Siepmann and co-workers46 carried out first
principle MD simulations of pure reline and its equimolar mixture
with water and showed that in hydrated DES, water competes for Cl– anions and disrupts H-bonding interaction between
urea and Cl–. The hydrogen atoms (H-atom) of urea
have equal probability to H-bond with Cl– anions
and with the oxygen atom of urea and water.46

Recent studies performed on understanding the structure of
pure
reline pointed out the importance of H-bonding interaction of Cl– with the amide group of urea and hydroxyl group of
Ch+ cations in determining the molecular level arrangement
in reline.7,40,41 The MD investigation
performed on aqueous reline majorly focused on the influence of water
on H-bonding behavior of urea–Cl– interaction
and how these two species interact with water.42,46 Because Ch+–Cl– and Ch+–Ch+ interaction are also substantially affected
by the presence of water,44 in order to
get further insights, herein, we have explored all possible H-bonding
interactions for a wide range of hydration levels. Another peculiar
feature which is already mentioned in the previous study by our group40 on pure reline is the presence of long-range
ordering which is observed only through partial X-ray scattering structure
functions. This low q (below q =
1 Å–1) feature is basically because of the
presence of strong positive correlation between co-ionic species and
negative correlation between counter-ionic species and cation–urea.
However, because of cancellation effects, no low q peak is observed in the total X-ray scattering structure function
of reline. Hence, it is crucial to understand the effect of hydration
on these long-range correlations. In this spirit, herein, we present
an atomistic MD study of reline–water mixtures containing 3.4,
6.5, 12.2, 21.7, 41.0, and 58.1 wt % of water to shed more light on
how the inverse and real-space correlations between different species
of reline are influenced at various hydration levels. We have analyzed
simulated X-ray scattering structure functions and their partial components,
hydrogen bonding interactions, radial and three-dimensional spatial
distribution functions (SDFs) for reline–water mixtures and
compared with that for pure reline.

Computational Details
The MD simulations were carried out using GPU version of the GROMACS-5.1.1
(single precision) package.48,49 Please refer to Figure 1 for chemical structures
of reline components. All species constituting reline (Ch+, Cl–, and urea) were modeled using CHARMM 36 force
field21,50 parameters as reported in the recent MD
simulation study from our group.40 The
validity of the force-field used for pure reline was checked against
ND experimental data7 and experimental
bulk density.51 The simulated neutron scattering
data including low q region are in good agreement
with experimental neutron scattering data. In order to further verify
the robustness of the force-field used here, we have carried out another
MD simulation by utilizing the non-bonded parameter Lennard-Jones
terms and partial charges suggested by ND/EPSR modeling7 and the bonded parameter from optimized potential
for liquid simulations (OPLS) force field and computed neutron scattering S(q) and compared against its experimental
counterpart. A comparative plot showing the simulated and experimental7S(q)s for pure
reline are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. The figure clearly shows that CHARMM 36 is not
only in good agreement with the experiment but also it is as good
as OPLS force field. Additionally, in Table S1 of the Supporting Information, the average coordination
number and peak positions of the first solvation peak of the center-of-mass
radial distribution functions (RDFs) between different constituent
species of reline obtained through CHARMM 36 force field is compared
with the Hammond et al. ND/EPSR study.7 A fair agreement between the average coordination number and maximum
and minimum of the first peak (rmax and rmin) compared to ND/EPSR is observed. Although
CHARMM 36 has sharper peaks with larger peak intensity compared to
the ND/EPSR study, the average coordination numbers are found within
statistical uncertainties. The SPC/E water model52 was used for water. The initial cubic simulation boxes
consisted of 1000 ion pairs of choline chloride (Ch+–Cl–), 2000 molecules of urea, and desired number of water
molecules were generated using the PACKMOL53 package. A summary of the reline–water systems simulated
in the present study is provided in Table 1 and chemical structures of Ch+ cation and urea with partial atomic charges are provided in Figure
S2 of the Supporting Information. A cubic
box containing 1000 molecules of water was also generated utilizing
PACKMOL for pure water simulation. Periodic boundary conditions and
minimum image convention were applied in all three directions of the
simulation box. To evaluate electrostatic interactions particle mesh
Ewald (PME)54,55 summation method with an interpolation
order of 6 and a Fourier grid spacing of 0.8 Å were used. For
short range interactions, the cut-off radius was set to 12 Å
with a switching function used from 10 to 12 Å. The equations
of motion were integrated using the leap-frog algorithm with 1 fs
time step. All hydrated reline systems were equilibrated in NPT ensemble for 60–70 ns at 303 K temperature and
1 bar pressure. The temperature and pressure of systems were maintained
using Nosé–Hoover thermostat56−58 and Parrinello–Rahman
barostat,59 respectively. To compute properties
of the equilibrated systems, 10 ns of production run was carried out
and trajectories were saved at every 100 fs.

In order to compare the properties of reline–water
mixtures
with pure reline, we have adapted the production run trajectory from
the previously simulated pure reline from our group40 and computed desired properties.

The total X-ray
scattering static structure function, S(q), was computed using the methodology provided
in the literature24 as 1  Here, gij(r) refers to partial RDFs, for the atoms
of type i and j involving both intra-
and intermolecular pairs. xi and xj denote
the mole fraction of atom types i and j, respectively. fi(q) and fj(q) are the X-ray atomic form factors.60 L is the average box length, and ρo is
total number density. Lorch window function, ω(r), could be used to reduce the effect of the finite truncation error
on the integral; ω(r) = sin(2πr/L)/(2πr/L).

Partial components of the total X-ray structure
function were computed
for reline–water mixtures to understand the origin of different
peaks observed in the total S(q)s.
We have used the following scheme for splitting the total S(q) into its species-wise partial components26,40 2  

Three-dimensional
SDFs were calculated using TRAVIS61 and
rendered by the visual MD (VMD) package.62 To define a hydrogen bond, a distance cut-off
of 3.5 Å between donor and acceptor atoms and hydrogen–donor–acceptor
angle less than 30° were taken as the geometrical criteria.

Results
and Discussion
Comparison of Simulated Density Against Experimental
Data
In order to validate the force field used for the aqueous
reline
systems simulated here, we have computed the bulk densities for the
whole range of composition studied and compared against the experimental
values. Figure 2 shows
a comparison of simulated density with the experimental data51 for the reline–water mixtures as a function
of the reline wt % (refer to Table S2 for
the tabulated data). The agreement between the simulation and experiment
is found to be fairly good over the entire composition range investigated
here.

of reline wt % for the reline-water mixture.

X-ray Scattering Static Structure Functions and Their Partial
Components
Figure 3 shows the X-ray scattering total structure functions, S(q)s, for water, pure reline, and reline–water
mixtures computed using eq 1. We can observe that the pure reline system shows a principal
peak at around q = 1.6 Å–1 which corresponds to a real-space distance of 3.9 Å, whereas
pure water shows two peaks centered around q = 2.1
and q = 2.8 Å–1 resembling
two real-space distances of about 3.0 and 2.2 Å. Figure 3 shows that the most prominent
peak (q = 1.6 Å–1) in the S(q) of pure reline shifts toward higher q values or shorter characteristic real-space length scales
with a gradual decrease in its intensity upon addition of water in
reline. Further, reaching on to a system containing the highest hydration
level in the present study, this peak is almost diminished. Moreover,
a new peak at a larger q value corresponding to that
of pure water emerges along with continuously shifting and fading
of the reline characteristic peak with addition of water in the DES.
Similar to that of the pure water system, the rel–20w (containing
58.1 wt % water) system shows two peaks at around q = 2 and 2.7 Å–1 indicating a transition of
intermolecular arrangement from reline to that of water. The shift
of the reline characteristic peak to shorter length scales (higher q values) with increase in water content shows a contraction
in the major intermolecular interaction distance from 3.9 to 3.1 Å.
These observations are in corroboration with recent ND experiments
performed for a range of reline–water (D2O) mixtures
by Edler and co-workers.44 The experimental
ND data also show merging of the characteristic peak of pure deuterated
reline with the D2O peak at higher hydration level.

Figure 3 Simulated X-ray
scattering total structure functions, S(q)s, for reline–water mixtures at different
hydration levels. The S(q)s for
pure reline and water are also shown for comparison. Pure reline data
were taken from the recently published article from our group.40

The significance of partitioning of total X-ray scattering
structure
function into its partial components for neat reline has been previously
reported by our group.40 As anticipated
from the partial structure functions, the major contribution to the
principal peak is due to positive urea–urea and Ch+–urea correlations along with little participation of Ch+–Cl– correlations. However, through
the partitioning of the total X-ray S(q)s for all reline–water mixtures, we observe that the addition
of water causes depreciation in these correlations leading to diminished
intensity of the principal peak (refer to Figure S3).

Another important feature observed through the partial
components
of total S(q) is the long-range
ordering, that is peaks and antipeaks displayed by partial S(q)s in the low q region
(0.8 < q/Å–1 < 1.0),
which is absent in the total X-ray S(q).40 We find that the addition of water
decreases the amplitudes of peaks for Ch+–Ch+ and urea–urea correlations and antipeaks for Ch+–urea and Ch+–Cl– correlations in the low q region along with their
shifts toward larger length scales as shown in Figure S3. This demonstrates the disruption of long-range
ordering in the mixture with the rise of water content. In Figure S4, the presence of long-range correlations
in the lower q region corresponding to Ch+–water, urea–water, Cl––water,
and water–water can also be seen. The antipeak for cation–water
gets pronounced with increasing water wt % upto rel–10w along
with a slight increase in intensity of the peak for water–water
at the same length scale in the lower q region. In
summary, hydration not only affects the close contact correlations
(anticipated from the principal peak) but also alters the arrangement
of reline–water components at longer distances.

Intermolecular
RDFs
In order to understand the influence
of water on the intermolecular interactions of reline components,
we have analyzed center-of-mass RDFs shown in Figure 4a–f. From Figure 4a, one can observe that for Ch+–Ch+ correlation, the position of the first solvation
peak shifts toward longer length scale along with a gradual decrease
in its intensity with increasing water concentration. This indicates
that Ch+–Ch+ correlation becomes weaker,
and the nearest neighbor distance between Ch+–Ch+ increases with increase in water concentration. Furthermore,
for the rel–20w system, the peak corresponding to the first
solvation shell in the neat reline system almost disappears implying
that with increase in water concentration, the water molecules come
in closer proximity of Ch+ than other Ch+ ions.
These observations are further explained through the analysis of H-bonding
interactions and SDFs discussed in the later sections.

RDFs, g(r), for (a) Ch+–Ch+, (b) Ch+–Cl–, (c) Ch+–urea,
(d) urea–urea, (e) Cl––urea, and (f)
Cl––Cl– in reline–water
mixtures. The RDF data for pure reline were taken from Kaur et al.40

Figure 4b,e
manifest
that for the pure reline system, urea–Cl– correlation is more prominent than Ch+–Cl– correlation, indicating the significance of urea–Cl– correlation for rendering DES nature of reline which
is also consistent with the previous studies on pure reline.7,40,46 The intensities of the nearest
neighbor peaks of Ch+–Cl– and
urea–Cl– correlations decrease with the addition
of water, however, the positions of the peaks remain unaffected for
the entire concentration range of reline–water mixtures investigated.
This points out that at a particular separation, the probability of
finding these pairs with respect to the bulk value decreases as the
water concentration increases. On the other hand, urea–urea
correlation becomes stronger, and the position of the nearest neighbor
peak of urea–urea RDF slightly shifts toward shorter length
scale than that in pure reline on the addition of water as evident
from Figure 4d.

Figure 4c indicates
that Ch+–urea correlation depends on the concentration
of water present in reline–water systems. At lower water concentration
(up to rel–2w system), there is a slight increase in Ch+–urea correlation, whereas at a higher hydration level,
Ch+–urea correlation decreases. This observation
is further explained through atomic RDFs discussed later on. The intensity
of the nearest neighbor peak for Cl––Cl– correlation (Figure 4f) decreases with addition of water up to the rel–1w
system after which a newly emerged solvation peak at a shorter distance
is observed. This suggest that Cl– ions come closer
in the presence of water as compared to neat reline. In addition,
refer to Figure S5a and Table S3 of the Supporting Information for the corresponding coordination numbers at different
compositions of the mixture. Center-of-mass RDFs and composition-dependent
coordination numbers for Ch+–water, urea–water,
Cl––water, and water–water correlations
are shown in Figures S6, S5b, and Table S4. Figure S5b and Table S4 clearly show that coordination
numbers for reline components–water increases with increasing
the hydration level in the mixture.

Hydrogen Bonding
In the past, it has been shown that
in pure reline, the specific H-bonding interactions of Cl− anions with hydroxyl hydrogen of Ch+ cations (HOCh+) and urea hydrogen atoms (Hurea)
play a central role to cater the eutectic nature of reline.40 In order to understand how the presence of water
affects these H-bonding interactions, we have computed atomic RDFs
for Nurea–Cl–, Hurea–Cl–, and HOCh+–Cl– pairs as shown in Figure 5a–c. It is apparent from Figure 5 that the Cl– anion has substantial H-bonding interactions with
hydroxyl hydrogen of Ch+ and amide groups of urea in neat
reline. With addition of water in reline, the intensities of the first
solvation peaks of these atomic RDFs continuously decrease, suggesting
a decrease in the probability of finding the nearest neighbor. Hence,
the H-bonding interactions of the Ch+ hydroxyl group and
amide groups of urea with the Cl– anion get weaker
in the presence of water. In addition, we have also studied the effect
of hydration on H-bonding interaction between Ch+ cations
and urea through HOCh+−Ourea RDF shown in Figure 6. The H-bonding interaction between urea oxygen (Ourea) and Ch+ hydroxyl hydrogen (HOCh+) depends on the amount of water in the reline–water mixture.
At lower wt % of water, there is slight increase in the H-bonding
interaction between HOCh+–Ourea as compared to neat reline. However, further increase in water concentration
reduces this H-bonding interaction. This observation is in accordance
with center-of-mass Ch+–urea correlation as discussed
in Figure 4c.

Figure 5 Atomic RDFs, g(r), for (a) Nurea–Cl–, (b) Hurea–Cl–, and (c) HOCh+–Cl– pairs in reline–water mixtures. Here, Nurea and
Hurea denote nitrogen and hydrogen atoms
of amide groups of urea, whereas HOCh+ represents
hydroxyl hydrogen of the Ch+ cation. RDFs for pure reline
are also shown for comparison.40

Figure 6 Atomic RDFs, g(r), for HOCh+–Ourea pair in
reline–water
systems. Here, HOCh+ and Ourea represents
hydroxyl hydrogen of the Ch+ cation and oxygen atom of
urea, respectively. RDF for pure reline is also shown for comparison.

We have also investigated the
various H-bonding interactions between
water and reline constituting species through atomic RDFs depicted
in Figure 7a–d.
Among all H-bonding interactions present between water and various
reline species, Cl– anions show the most intense
H-bonding tendency with water (see Figure 7a), which implies to substantial hydration
of the Cl– anion as compared to other species. This
observation is also confirmed through the presence of the highest
number of H-bonds between Cl– anions and water shown
in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information. In addition to this, from Figures 5c and 7b,c we observe that there is an enhance tendency
of water molecules to get closer to hydroxyl group of the cation with
increasing water content as depicted from peak position values (refer
to Tables S5 and S6).

Figure 7 Atomic RDFs, g(r), for (a) Cl––Hwater, (b) HOCh+–Owater, (c) OCh+–Hwater, and (d)
Hurea–Owater pairs
showing H-bonding interactions in reline–water mixtures. Here,
Hwater and Owater represent hydrogen and oxygen
atoms of water, respectively. OCh+ denotes hydroxyl
oxygen atom of the Ch+ cation. Other denotations are same
as mentioned in Figure 5.

The variation in the number of
H-bonds with time for all possible
H-bonding interactions in neat reline and reline–water mixtures
is shown in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information. The corresponding average number of H-bonds is also provided in
Table S7 of the Supporting Information.
The numbers of H-bonds between hydroxyl group of Ch+ (OHCh+)–Cl– and amide groups of urea (NHurea)–Cl– decrease and Cl––water increases monotonically with increasing hydration level.
This clearly demonstrates that when water is introduced in pure reline,
it preferentially starts solvating Cl– anions. It
can also be observed that the average number of H-bonds increases
for Ch+–water pair as compared to Ch+−Cl– pair which supports the notion of increasing
tendency of water molecules to come closer to Ch+ cations.
The H-bond analysis of OHCh+−Ourea shows
non-monotonic behavior with the addition of water as mentioned previously.
At lower hydration level, the OHCh+−Ourea H-bonding interactions tend to increase with increase in water concentration,
but as we move beyond the rel–2w system, the H-bonding propensity
diminishes. This behavior corresponds to enhanced tendency of water
molecules to be in vicinity of cations and urea. In the past, Shah
and Mjalli42 also observed preferential
hydration of the Cl– anion as compared to cation
or urea molecule in aqueous reline. Another MD simulation study performed
by Gao and co-workers63 on reline–water
mixtures also reported that hydration strength of the Cl– anion is stronger than Ch+ cation over all water fraction
investigated.

The analysis of center-of-mass RDFs and H-bonding
stipulate the
subtle changes in the molecular arrangement of reline species around
Ch+ cations upon introduction of water in the pure reline
system. In order to visualize this fact, in Figure 8, we have rendered the representative molecular
arrangement of different reline species within a distance of 4 Å
from the central Ch+ cation for pure reline and different
reline–water mixtures. In pure reline, we can see the preferred
H-bonding interactions between Cl– anions and urea
molecules. Figure 8a indicates that pure reline has 4 Cl– anions around
Ch+ cation which shows H-bonding interactions with hydroxyl
hydrogen of Ch+ cation and with amide hydrogens of urea
molecules. The reline–water system containing 3.4 wt % of water
still have 4 Cl– anions around the Ch+ cation; however, each Cl– anion is followed by
a water molecule suggesting that water first starts solvating Cl– anions. Further increase in water content increases
the number of water molecules and reduces the presence of Ch+, Cl–, and urea molecules around the Ch+ cation. The rel–4w system shows 2 Cl– anions,
one Cl– pointing toward the hydroxyl hydrogen of
the Ch+ cation indicating the existence of preferred H-bonding
interaction between the Ch+ cation and Cl– anion. However, in case of the rel–10w system, most Cl– anions are replaced with water molecules as evident
from Figure 8d, suggesting
the substitution of Ch+–Cl– H-bond
with Ch+–water. At the highest hydration level,
we can observe the presence of a solvation shell of water molecules
around Ch+ cation as most of the reline–reline H-bonding
pairs are replaced with reline–water H-bonding pairs.

and (e) rel–20w systems containing 0, 3.4, 21.7, 41, and 58.1
wt % water, respectively. In the snapshots, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon,
and hydrogen atoms of Ch+ cations, urea, and water are
shown as blue, red, cyan, and white stick, respectively. Cl– anions are rendered as green spheres. Decrease in the numbers of
Cl– anions and other reline constituting species
along with increase in the number of water molecules around the cation
is clearly visible as the hydration level in the mixture increases.

Spatial Distribution Functions
SDFs showing the nearest
solvation shells of Cl– anions and Ch+ cations around Ch+ cation in the pure reline and reline–water
mixtures containing 3.4, 21.7, and 41 wt % of water (corresponding
to rel–0.5w, rel–4w, and rel–10w systems, respectively)
are depicted in Figure 9a–d. Along with this, we have also shown the SDF of water
around Ch+ cation to get a qualitative picture of change
in the arrangement of water with increasing hydration level. We observe
that water and Cl– anion compete for the Ch+ cation as the Cl– isodensity surface is
intervened by that of water with increase in water concentration.
This observation corroborates with the previously mentioned real-space
correlations shown in Figure 4b.

% water, respectively.

Another significant observation is the change in isosurface
density
of cations around a central cation. As water is added in reline, it
starts irrupting near the hydroxyl and ammonium groups of Ch+ but at a closer distance than other Ch+ owing to enhanced
H-bonding interactions between the Ch+ hydroxyl group and
water molecules, which is also previously seen in the RDFs (see Figure 7b,c). As evident
from Figure 9b–d,
the density surface of water around Ch+ increases with
increase in water concentration, also indicating that water molecules
gradually push Ch+ cations apart.

SDFs showing the
nearest solvation shell of Ch+ cations
and Cl– anions around urea for pure reline and reline–water
mixtures containing 3.4, 21.7, and 41 wt % of water are depicted in Figure 10a–d. The
isodensity surface of water around urea is also shown in Figure 10b–d for
reline–water systems. For pure reline, Cl– anion lobs are pointed toward amide hydrogens, whereas Ch+ cation isodensity surface takes positions all around urea molecule
as manifested in Figure 10a. When water is introduced in reline, it starts solvating
Cl– anions first and then approaches to the oxygen
atom of the urea molecule at higher water concentration as evident
from Figure 10b–d.
Hence, it is apparent that with increase in water concentration, isodensity
surface of Cl– anions around urea starts decreasing,
whereas that of water starts increasing, thus affirming the decrease
in urea–Cl– H-bonding intensity. The isodensity
surface of Ch+ cations around urea shows concentration-dependent
behavior similar to what is observed in corresponding RDF described
in Figure 4c.

Figure 10 SDFs of Ch+ (yellow, transparent), Cl– (green, transparent),
and water (blue, wired frame) around urea
for (a) pure reline, (b) rel–0.5w, (c) rel–4w, and (d)
rel–10w systems containing 0, 3.4, 21.7, and 41 wt % water,
respectively.

Conclusions
We
have reported an all-atom MD simulation study to provide an
insight on how intermolecular and H-bonding interactions between different
species of reline are affected when water is introduced in reline
across a wide range of hydration levels. It was shown that the presence
of water gradually reduces the various interactions between the components
of reline. The examination of SDFs and RDFs revealed that when water
is added in reline, it preferentially solvates Cl– anions and ammonium and hydroxyl groups of Ch+ cations.
It was observed that at higher hydration level, Ch+–Ch+, Ch+–Cl–, and Cl––Cl– interactions are most
intensely affected as the water molecules systematically arrange themselves
around Cl– and choline hydroxyl group at a shorter
distance than urea and Cl– via H-bonding interaction.
As also observed in the neutron scattering experiments,44 the simulated X-ray scattering structure functions
showed that below 41 wt % water level, the reline structure is qualitatively
retained, indicating 41 wt % of water is the transition point above
which the mixture turns into an aqueous solution of reline components.
We conclude by noting that further simulation studies are required
for understanding the interfacial structure of the reline–water
system near electrode materials for their optimum use in advance energy
storage devices.64
