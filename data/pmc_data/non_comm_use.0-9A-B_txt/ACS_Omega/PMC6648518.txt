The sol–gel transition of
a series of polyester polyol resins
possessing varied secondary hydroxyl content and reacted with a polymerized
aliphatic isocyanate cross-linking agent is studied to elucidate the
effect of molecular architecture on cure behavior. Dynamic rheology
is utilized in conjunction with time-resolved variable-temperature
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to examine the relationship
between chemical conversion and microstructural evolution as functions
of both time and temperature. The onset of a percolated microstructure
is identified for all resins, and apparent activation energies extracted
from Arrhenius analyses of gelation and average reaction kinetics
are found to depend on the secondary hydroxyl content in the polyester
polyols. The similarity between these two activation energies is explored.
Gel point suppression is observed in all the resin systems examined,
resulting in significant deviations from the classical gelation theory
of Flory and Stockmayer. The magnitude of these deviations depends
on secondary hydroxyl content, and a qualitative model is proposed
to explain the observed phenomena, which are consistent with results
previously reported in the literature.

1 Introduction
Polymeric systems are
employed in a wide range of applications
from precisely shaped 3D parts to protective film coatings on various
substrates.1−5 For numerous coating technologies, thermosetting polymers are often
found to be particularly attractive because of their inherent ability
to form densely cross-linked networks that impart a favorable combination
of mechanical, barrier, and chemical-resistance properties.2,6−8 Such coating systems can take the form of dry powders9−11 or variable-viscosity liquids (water-borne12,13 or solvent-borne14) and can be applied
as aerosol sprays, brushed finishes, or rolled laminates onto a solid
substrate prior to curing. Nearly all polymeric coatings are broadly
divided into two categories: one-component (1K) and two-component
(2K) systems.8 Most of these polymers are
acrylic-, alkyd-, or polyester-based, and they react in the presence
of a cross-linking agent to form dense molecular networks. Polyester-based
urethane systems are popular 2K systems because of their versatility,
desirable barrier/mechanical properties, and good weathering capability.15 Understanding their cure behavior is crucial
for designing such multicomponent polymers for coatings applications.
In these systems, a polyol/catalyst/solvent mixture is typically combined
with an isocyanate cross-linking agent, and the resulting mixture
is sprayed or painted onto a substrate. While properties for transparent
coatings must adhere to quality standards that vary with application,16 coating viscosities must be compatible with
the deposition method, and associated cross-linking behavior must
be acceptable for industrially relevant cure conditions, as well as
for favorable film properties once cured.

The monomer 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl
1,3-cyclobutanediol (TMCD) has
been previously investigated15 in thermoplastic
polyester systems and has been successfully commercialized as part
of the Tritan copolyester manufactured by the Eastman Chemical Company.
Prior efforts have demonstrated that TMCD improves the impact resistance
of polyester-based systems while maintaining good thermal properties.17 However, studies describing how the incorporation
of TMCD in a polyester backbone affects cure behavior in 2K thermosetting
polyesters remain lacking. Chemical conversion and accompanying thermomechanical
property evolution constitute two vital characteristics of a coating
system when considering the cure behavior of any 2K thermosetting
coating. Previous efforts in this vein have relied on thermal calorimetry
to monitor reaction kinetics and the corresponding evolution of the
glass transition temperature (Tg), dynamic
rheology to identify the sol–gel transition (also known as
the gel point), and spectroscopy to measure the time-dependent chemical
conversion at various temperatures.18−25 These analytical techniques provide useful insights when performed
independently but are especially valuable when used in parallel, as
is the case here and in previous works.26,27 In this study,
we seek to exploit the complementary benefits of dynamic rheology
and variable-temperature spectroscopy by directly relating network
evolution in TMCD-containing resins in 2K polyester-polyol resins
systematically varying in backbone chemistry with chemical conversion
during the cure process at different industrially relevant temperatures.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Polyester
resins were supplied
by Eastman Chemical Company and used as-received. Figure 1 depicts the chemical structures
of all the monomers employed in the synthesis of the polyester resins.
The cross-linking agent was hexamethylene diisocyanurate (HDI trimer),
purchased from Covestro (Desmodur 3390 BA/SN) and also pictured in Figure 1. Dibutyltin dilaurate
(95%) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and urethane-grade methyl amyl ketone
(MAK) supplied by the Eastman Chemical Company were both used without
further purification.

polyols are displayed in (a–e). (a) Neopentane glycol (NPG),

and (e) 1,4-cyclohexanediacid (CHDA). The chemical structure of the

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Specimen Preparation
Gel permeation
chromatography with polystyrene standards was conducted in an Agilent
Series 1260 liquid chromatograph with a UV/vis detector to measure
the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index, or molar-mass dispersity (Đ), of each resin, the composition and properties of which are listed
in Table 1. The dibutyltin
dilaurate catalyst was mixed with MAK to produce a 1 wt % catalyst
solution, which was added at 2.5 wt % (relative to the total solids)
to a known quantity of polyester resin in MAK. This catalyst/polyester/solvent
mixture, hereafter referred to as component “A,” was
then agitated in the presence of a magnetic stir bar in a 20 mL glass
scintillation vial until the polymer was fully dissolved (∼8
h). A predetermined quantity of component A was added to a 10 mL glass
scintillation vial, and the cross-linking agent (component “B”)
was added dropwise under agitation to achieve a NCO/OH stoichiometric
ratio of 1.10 ± 0.02:1 at a constant solids content of 60 ±
2%. This mixture was then placed on a stir plate for 5 min at ambient
temperature before analysis.

2.2.2 Rheological Analysis
Dynamic oscillatory
shear rheology was conducted to monitor the cross-linking reaction
of each polyester in the presence of the HDI trimer. All rheological
measurements were performed on a TA Instruments Discovery Series Hybrid
Rheometer HR-3, outfitted with a Peltier plate temperature-control
system and operated with 40 mm aluminum parallel plates and a solvent
trap. Each experiment commenced after sample equilibration for 5 min
at the reaction temperature. Reaction progress was followed in situ
as a function of time at a fixed strain amplitude within the linear
viscoelastic regime of the sample at an angular frequency of 1 rad/s.
Measured shear stresses were used to calculate the dynamic storage
(G′) and loss (G″)
moduli. To identify the temperature dependence of the gel point, times
required for G′–G″
crossover were evaluated at four different temperatures for each resin.
We further discuss this gel-point criterion in subsequent sections.

2.2.3 Variable-Temperature Spectroscopy
Variable-temperature
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
was performed in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode on specimens
with a Bio-Rad Excalibur Series spectrometer equipped with a germanium
crystal and a PIKE Technologies heating stage. Approximately 0.05
g of each sample were placed on the crystal and heating stage, and
a solvent trap was placed over the sample to prevent drying. The reaction
clock began when the sample was placed on the stage, and spectra were
collected as a function of time at each reaction temperature. A zero-point
spectrum was collected 5 min after the sample was loaded to allow
for excess CO2 to be flushed out of the spectrometer. Following
the collection of FTIR spectra, baseline corrections were performed
using the Win-IR Pro software package from Bio-Rad. Peak areas were
calculated with Origin.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Gelation from Dynamic Rheology
Small-amplitude
dynamic rheology identifies the time required to achieve G′–G″ crossover at 1 rad/s for all samples. This
time, referred to as tc, affords an estimate
of the gel point at which a contiguous network forms within a specimen.
Networks are ubiquitous and important physical phenomena in polymers,
as they are responsible for generating not only dense thermosets but
also stretchy elastomers. Moreover, networks can be either chemically
cross-linked, as is the case here, or they can be physically cross-linked
in the case of, for instance, multiblock copolymers.28 Once tc is reached, G′ (a measure of elastic behavior) becomes equal
to and subsequently greater than G″ (a measure
of viscous behavior). Therefore, at this point in time, the sample
begins to exhibit more solid-like behavior. According to the Winter–Chambon
rheological criterion for gelation, the true gel point occurs when
tan δ (=G″/G′)
becomes independent of frequency.29,30 The systems
examined here do not strictly adhere to the Winter–Chambon
criterion over the temperature range examined, so a true gel point
is not possible to identify. Therefore, defining tc as the transition from viscous- to solid-like behavior
at a single frequency is considered sufficient for the purpose of
this study. A representative time sweep is presented in Figure 2 for resin 0T at 45 °C
and clearly reveals the existence of G′–G″ crossover at tc ≈
130 min. Data such as these are employed to construct Figure 3a, which displays the average
time for moduli crossover for all five resins examined at four different
temperatures. An important observation in this figure is that resins
possessing higher levels of secondary hydroxyl content due to the
presence of TMCD require appreciably longer times for network formation.
We attribute this result to the TMCD secondary hydroxyl groups, which
make the monomer more sterically hindered than NPG or TMP with primary
hydroxyl groups (see Figure 1).

Figure 2 Variation of the dynamic moduli (G′ and G″, labeled and color-coded) with reaction time during
the cure of resin 0T at 45 °C. The gel point at tc is identified at the G′–G″ crossover. The solid lines serve to connect the
data.

crossover times (see Figure 2) as functions of resin composition (secondary hydroxyl content)
and temperature (see color-coded legend). The color-matched solid
lines serve to connect the data. (b) Arrhenius-style representation
of tc as a function of reciprocal temperature
for five different polyester-polyol resins (see color-coded legend).
The solid lines are linear regressions of eq 1 to the data, and the apparent activation
energy values extracted from the slopes are listed in Table 2.

In addition, the time required for modulus crossover is seen
to
increase systematically with decreasing reaction temperature, a feature
that is consistent with the behavior of a thermally activated process.
This expectation is confirmed by the linear trends evident in Figure 3b, which is an Arrhenius-style
representation of the data provided in Figure 3a. Because of the thermally activated nature
of the gelation process, previous studies31−34 of related systems have used
an Arrhenius expression to extract values of the apparent activation
energy (Ea) of gelation, viz., 1  where tc,0 is
a constant, R is the universal gas constant, and T denotes absolute temperature. Values of Ea calculated from the slopes of the lines in Figure 3b according to eq 1 are compiled in Table 2 for each resin. In general, resins with a higher secondary
hydroxyl content exhibit higher Ea values.
It is interesting that values of Ea ascertained
for 0T and 25T are similar, while those for 50T, 75T, and 100T are
likewise comparable. These groupings can be explained by considering
the Flory–Stockmayer theory for gelation in conjunction with
the difference in reactivity between primary and secondary hydroxyls.35,36 For all the resin systems examined, the theoretical conversion of
the total alcohol functionality is approximately 50% at the gel point.
Because the reactivity of the secondary hydroxyls differs substantially
from primary hydroxyls in the presence of dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst,37 the secondary hydroxyls do not necessarily need
to participate fully in network formation at concentration levels
below ∼50% (e.g., samples 0T and 25T). Thus, the apparent activation
energies reported here do not reflect the chemical kinetics governing
the cross-linking reaction, but rather afford insight into network
formation and the thermal process governing it.

Another classical network theory,
proposed by Carothers,38 has been expanded
to include nonstoichiometric
monomer mixtures by Pinner.39 This theory
and its subsequent expansion predict significantly higher critical
extents of conversion to achieve gelation in polymeric systems than
those given by Flory and Stockmayer.35,36,40 We return to discuss this topic further in following
sections.

3.2 Reactivity from Chemical Spectroscopy
Variable-temperature FTIR permits tracking the time-dependent intensity
of the isocyanate peak for the five resins examined at four temperatures
(45, 50, 55, and 60 °C). Examples of overlaid FTIR spectra collected
from one resin (100T) at one temperature (55 °C) are displayed
for illustrative purposes at several reaction times in Figure 4. To determine the concentration
of the isocyanate functional group as a function of time, we first
measure the area below the isocyanate stretch peak located at ∼2260
cm–1 and then normalize the result with respect
to the area below the C–H stretch peaks between ∼2840
and ∼3050 cm–1. The conversion of the isocyanate
functional group (p) at any given time (t) is then calculated from 2  where At is the normalized area under the isocyanate peak at t and A0 is the normalized area
under the isocyanate peak at t = 5 min. [The true
zero time was not used because excess CO2 had to be flushed
from the spectrometer once the sample was loaded.] The same procedure
has been followed for all five resins, and the conversion of the isocyanate
peak has been monitored as functions of both time and temperature,
as illustrated in Figure 5a for resin 100T. These results confirm that the reaction
reaches full conversion faster at higher temperatures and that full
conversion appears to be achieved in less than 20 h over the temperature
range examined here.

Figure 4 Representative FTIR spectra acquired at different reaction
times
(labeled and color-coded) from the 100T resin at 55 °C. Disappearance
of the isocyanate peak at 2260 cm–1 (identified),
normalized with respect to the C–H stretch peak (identified),
is used to determine the reaction kinetics.

Figure 5 (a) Isocyanate conversion (p) calculated for resin
100T from eq 2 in the
text and presented as a function of reaction time at four different
temperatures (see color-coded legend). The color-matched solid lines
serve as guides for the eye. (b) Isocyanate conversion for resin 100T
presented as a function of reaction time according to first-order
kinetics (see eq 4) at
the same four temperatures as in (a). The color-matched solid lines
are linear regressions to the data, and the slopes yield the kinetic
rate constants.

By assuming first-order
reaction kinetics, the data presented in Figure 5a can be analyzed
to extract kinetic rate constant (k) values. In this
scenario, p can be written as 3  

Algebraic rearrangement
of eq 3 yields 4  in which case
a plot of (1 – p) versus t on semi-logarithmic coordinates
is expected to yield a linear trend, which is clearly observed in Figure 5b. The results displayed
in Figure 5b are consistent
with first-order reaction kinetics with respect to the isocyanate
group for all five resin systems. To confirm the existence of first-order
kinetics and rule out other possibilities, we have also examined the
conversion data for all five systems in the context of second-order
kinetics with respect to the isocyanate group. The linear trends obtained
from first-order kinetics agree much more closely with the measured
conversions. The slopes of the curves in Figure 5b afford the first-order rate constants for
resin 100T over the four temperatures examined. For consistency with
the rheological analysis, we have elected to include data points from
the beginning of the reaction to the time corresponding to the modulus
crossover in our rheological tests. As such, the rate constants obtained
from conversion–time plots such as the one shown in Figure 5b constitute average
rate constants for the reaction between t = 5 min
and t ≈ tc.

First-order kinetic rate constants discerned for the five resin
systems are provided as functions of secondary hydroxyl content and
temperature in Figure 6. As anticipated, the rate constants generally increase with increasing
temperature for all five resin systems examined and decrease with
increasing secondary hydroxyl content. To relate the temperature dependence
of these first-order rate constants to the secondary hydroxyl content, Figure 7 plots the data acquired
for each resin in Arrhenius form. In accord with our earlier analysis
employing this representation (cf. Figure 3b), the slope of each line is used to extract
the apparent kinetic activation energy of each resin up to tc. These apparent activation energies are included
for comparison with the apparent activation energies of gelation in Table 2. In Figure 7, the linearity of the data
corresponding to the TMCD-rich resin systems (75T and 100T) appears
to deviate at the lowest temperature examined (45 °C).

Figure 6 Dependence
of the first-order kinetic rate constants calculated
from plots such as the one provided in Figure 5b on composition at four different temperatures
(see color-coded legend). The color-matched solid lines serve to connect
the data.

Figure 7 Arrhenius-style representation of the kinetic
rate constants as
a function of reciprocal temperature for five different polyester-polyol
resins (see color-coded legend). The solid lines are linear regressions
to the data, and the apparent activation energy values extracted from
the slopes are included in Table 2.

To take this deviation
into account, the apparent activation energies
tabulated in Table 2 for these two resins are calculated with and without the datum point
measured at 45 °C. This deviation at low temperature might be
indicative of nontrivial diffusion limitations within the system as
it cures. All the apparent kinetic activation energy values reported
here naturally involve some degree of complex interplay between reaction
and diffusion limitations because they are derived from average kinetic
rate constants from the initial time (when the system behaves highly
Newtonian) to the modulus crossover time (when the system begins to
exhibit more solid- than viscous-like behavior). Another important
consideration is that an increase in secondary hydroxyl content due
to TMCD incorporation induces chain stiffening of the polyester resin.
The impact of this phenomenon is discussed further below.

The
apparent activation energies of gelation, measured by dynamic
rheology, and the apparent kinetic activation energy, measured by
VT-FTIR, are compared in Figure 8. While this comparison does
not include the activation energies for the 75T and 100T resins calculated
by omitting the rate constants measured at 45 °C, we note that
the rheological activation energy values are generally lower than
those determined by chemical analysis. The error bars included in Figure 8 correspond to the
standard error in the slope of the Arrhenius-style representations
used to ascertain Ea for each resin system.
It is comforting that the measured apparent kinetic activation energies
and apparent activation energies of gelation are relatively close
and, in most cases, equal within experimental error. Such agreement
does not, however, have to be the case. Because gelation is undoubtedly
a thermally activated process, it can be modeled as an Arrhenius phenomenon.
With this expectation notwithstanding, the activation energy does
not take into account the molecular-level phenomena accompanying a
physical phase transition, but is rather a measure of the temperature
dependence of a mechanical property. In contrast, the apparent kinetic
activation energies provide insight into the chemical changes occurring
within the resins due to the cross-linking reaction and can be used
in conjunction with measured reaction times to determine the relative
reactivity of the different hydroxyl-containing constituents. As we
have measured it here, the apparent kinetic activation energy constitutes
an average activation energy from the beginning of the reaction to
the modulus crossover time and provides information not only on the
chemical nature of the reactive system as the cross-linked network
develops, but also on how the hydroxyl reactivities change along the
reaction coordinate.

Figure 8 Comparison of apparent activation energies of gelation
and reaction
(see color-coded legend) as determined by rheological and spectroscopic
analyses, respectively. The error bars correspond to the standard
error, and the color-matched solid lines serve to connect the data.

3.3 Critical
Extent of Conversion
Another
important metric of the present thermosetting resins is the critical
extent of isocyanate conversion calculated at the time required for
modulus crossover, as discerned by dynamic rheology. This critical
conversion evaluated at tc is presented
in Figure 9. Two important
observations are immediately evident in this figure. The first is
that the critical conversion gradually increases from ∼71 to
93% with increasing secondary hydroxyl content. Moreover, for all
the resins examined, the critical conversion at tc deviates significantly from predictions afforded by
the Flory–Stockmayer theory.35,36 According
to this theory, all reactive moieties in a chain possess the same
reactivity that does not change as the reaction proceeds and microstructure
develops. These results also deviate from Carothers’ theory
under nonstoichiometric conditions when the statistical secondary
hydroxyl content is above 50%.38−40 Moreover, these theories do not
take into account any reactions that form network defects. Deviation
from these theories increases further as the secondary hydroxyl content
approaches 100%. Similar deviations of theoretical gel points reported
in previous studies have been explained by such phenomena as intramolecular
cyclization, intramolecular cross-linking, microgelation, and excluded
volume effects especially at high molecular weights.41−44 We attribute such deviation in the present work to two different
reasons. One is the catalyst choice, because dibutyltin dilaurate
catalyzes the isocyanate reaction with primary hydroxyls and water
much more effectively than it catalyzes the reaction of isocyanate
with secondary hydroxyls.37 Although these
resins are presumed to be dry, residual water from either the atmosphere
or the solvent can react with the isocyanate to form urea. If present,
every water molecule will react with two isocyanate functionalities
to form a urea linkage.45

Figure 9 Critical isocyanate conversion
levels evaluated by VT-FTIR spectroscopy
at the G′–G″
crossover as a function of resin composition. Corresponding predictions
from the Flory–Stockmayer theory35,36 and Carothers’
theory38−40 are also included for comparison (red and black dashed
lines, respectively), and the solid line serves to connect the data.

A more significant and related
consideration is the unequal reactivity
between different types of hydroxyl groups, and the resulting change
in Tg. The effect of TMCD addition on
the Tg of comparable films is the subject
of a companion study.999 These differences
are believed to be responsible for heterogeneous cross-linking and
corresponding network fluctuations within the system, as confirmed
previously by both experimental and computational studies.46−49 Isocyanate groups on the cross-linking agent react much more rapidly
with primary hydroxyls than with secondary hydroxyls. As a result,
nearly all the primary hydroxyls react first, creating cross-linked
microenvironments possessing a high cross-link density. Because of
their size and irregular shape, these fluctuation regions diffuse
more slowly and ultimately take a longer time to encounter one another
and undergo further cross-linking. In the meantime, however, they
continue to react within their local environments, thereby forming
larger volumes of more highly cross-linked chains without the formation
of a space-filling (percolated) network. Within these local environments,
network defects do not promote network elasticity development and
therefore do not contribute to mechanical properties measured by dynamic
rheology up to tc. The chemical reaction
continues to proceed, leading to a phenomenon previously reported
as gel-point suppression.51,52 Resultant network defects
take the form of loops (which behave as single-anchored polymer tails)
instead of bridges (which serve as connecting units during network
formation).28 The existence of loops has
been recently quantified using experimental and computational techniques
for several chemically cross-linked polymer systems.51,53−55 The propensity of loop defects is exacerbated by
reaction medium concentration, as demonstrated56 for tetrafunctional reactants. With the presence of ∼40
wt % MAK in the present systems, we propose that such defects become
increasingly prevalent as the TMCD content is increased, as evidenced
by the results displayed in Figure 9. Fluctuations continue to grow until they ultimately
encounter one another, at which time they can react to form a space-filling
network.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, the cross-linking behavior of model polyester–polyol
systems has been investigated by both mechanical and chemical means,
and the two characterization techniques have been used in conjunction
to systematically identify material changes as the systems cross-link
and ultimately reach the sol–gel transition. We have established
that an incremental increase in the secondary hydroxyl content in
the backbone (due to incorporation of TMCD) serves to increase both
the reaction time and the critical conversion (measured by VT-FTIR)
at the modulus crossover time (measured by dynamic rheology). Although
the present resins do not strictly adhere to the Winter–Chambon
criterion for gelation,29,30 the G′–G″ crossover is identified
here as the effective gel point at which the resins undergo their
sol–gel transition. Values of the effective activation energies
of gelation and reactivity are in favorable quantitative agreement
(within experimental error), directly confirming that the isocyanate
reaction is coupled to the growing network. A conceptual rationalization
has been proposed to explain deviations from theoretical models (such
as the Carothers’ theory38−40 and classic Flory–Stockmayer
theory35,36) that do not consider heterogeneities in
cross-linking behavior or loop formation during cure. It lies at the
intersection of two competing molecular-level processes: chemical
cross-linking and chain vitrification. As the secondary hydroxyl content
is increased in the present resins, the stiffness of the backbone
also increases due to the sterically hindered nature of the TMCD monomer
relative to NPG. This increased stiffness reduces chain mobility and
increases cross-linking heterogeneity. Groups of chains are more likely
to react with those functional groups in closer proximity, leading
to the formation of loops as opposed to branches in the network. Figure 10 is a schematic
illustration of this process. While computer simulations are currently
unavailable to elucidate the conditions responsible for the formation
of defects during cure, this explanation is consistent with previous
studies that have identified heterogeneous network formation and loop
development within network-forming polymers.54,55,57−59 The cure behavior reported
in this study provides useful mechanochemical insight into the cure
process of polyester-polyol resins and can be used to design and synthesize
multicomponent resins for specific coating applications.
