Methyltrimethyltridecylchromans (MTTCs)
are structurally similar
to tocopherols, which were identified in large numbers of source rocks
and crude oils (Pleistocene to Early Cambrian). The occurrence of
MTTCs was widely used as a proxy indicator of paleosalinity in the
field of organic geochemistry. However, their origin and geological
formation pathway still remain greatly debated. Here, we review the
progress made over the past 30 years in the distribution and origin
of MTTCs and their applications. Furthermore, we discussed several
key points for future studies on MTTCs.

Introduction
Methylated isoprenoid chromans are components
that have a methylated
2-methyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)chroman (MTTC) structure (Figure 1). The structure,
origin, and potential application of MTTCs in geological samples were
first studied in detail by Sinninghe Damsté et al. in 1987.1 Also, the first ratio of 5,7,8-trimethyl MTTC/8-methyl
MTTC (α/δ-MTTC) was established by Sinninghe Damsté
et al. as a parameter for paleosalinity reconstruction, which was
widely used in a later study although with some modifications.1 Generally, MTTCs consisting of monomethyl (δ-MTTC),
dimethyl (β-MTTC, γ-MTTC, ζ-MTTC), and trimethyl
(α-MTTC) homologues1,2 were widely found in
immature and low-mature source rock/sediment extracts and crude oils.1−15

Figure 1 Structures
of MTTCs.

MTTCs are preserved in the aromatic
fraction of the extract of
source rocks and crude oils.1,2 They can be accurately
detected on the basis of the mass spectra and relative retention times
by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
techniques.1 Tulipani et al.16 developed a pyrolysis-gas chromatography-isotope
ratio mass spectrometry (PY-GC-irMS) method to measure the δ13C values of pyrolysis products generated from α-MTTC.
Since MTTCs are easy to be identified, they were found to be widespread
in source rocks that were deposited in marine and lacustrine environments.1−15

Studies on the MTTCs in source rocks over the past 30 years
showed
that paleosalinity is the key factor controlling the distribution
and abundance of MTTCs.1−15 Some studies indicated that MTTC parameters might be used as a proxy
to indicate freshwater incursion17 or the
degree of maturity.18−20 The origin of MTTCs has been a scientific problem
affecting applications of MTTC parameters for nearly 30 years. Do
MTTCs form via biosynthesis1,4 or condensation reactions
of alkylated phenols with phytol?21,22

We review
here the progress made in over 30 years in the studies
of changes in the abundance and distribution of MTTCs in source rocks
and crude oils and their applications. We also discussed several key
points for future studies of MTTCs.

Analytical Methods for
MTTCs
MTTCs are present in the aromatic fractions of source
rock extracts
and crude oils. The source rock extracts can be acquired by multiple
methods such as Soxhlet extraction. The extracts were separated using
a silica/alumina column, and the aromatics were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS).1 MTTCs were
identified by comparing their mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 121, 135, and 149.1 Biomarker ratios were calculated using the peak areas in the appropriate
molecular ion chromatograms. The percentages of the ions in the total
MTTC ion intensities were used to calculate the relative abundances
of MTTC homologues. The quantitative analysis of MTTCs could use synthesized
MTTCs as the internal standard, which were synthesized by a condensation
reaction of phytol with phenol derivatives.1,2

Distribution
of MTTCs
MTTCs were mainly identified in the evaporite-related
source rocks
and crude oils (Figure 2a). The evaporite-related source rocks contain varying lithology
types including mudstone, black shale, marl, halite deposits, etc.23−31 The organic matter abundances of these evaporite-related source
rocks vary greatly from organic-rich to organic-lean and contained
type I, type II, and type III kerogens.23−31 Based on previous studies, we found that source rocks containing
MTTCs were not widely distributed globally; they were found mainly
in salt-bearing sedimentary basins in China and Europe.32,33 By comparing Figure 2a and Figure 2b, we
found that evaporite-related source rocks were globally distributed,34 while MTTCs were not detected in most of these
evaporite-related organic sediments. There are two possible reasons
that may explain this situation. One of the possible reasons is that
MTTCs in most of these source rocks have not been studied. The other
reason is that some of these source rocks are at the mature to overmature
stages, while MTTCs were present only in immature and low-mature source
rocks and not detected in mature and high-mature source rocks (Table 1). The thermal stability
of MTTC is weak.18−20 The geochemical features and geological significances
of MTTCs in evaporite-related source rocks still need to be further
researched.

The MTTC parameters were commonly
used as important organic geochemical
indicators to reconstruct paleosalinity. MTTCs have been detected
in the Early Cambrian to Quaternary source rocks (sediments) or crude
oils, except for Carboniferous, Silurian, and Ordovician source rocks
or crude oils (Table 1 and Figure 3a). Among
the source rocks and crude oil samples from which MTTCs were detected,
the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene samples were the most common
(Table 1). This may
be related to the development of the saline sedimentary environments
during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene period and the low degree
of thermal maturity of these samples (Table 1, Figure 3b). MTTCs were mainly enriched in rock/sediment extracts
and crude oils with a low degree of thermal maturity.18−20

Figure 3 (a)
MTTCs were detected in the Early Cambrian-Quaternary sediments
or crude oils, except for the Carboniferous, Silurian, and Ordovician
sediments or crude oils.1−48 (b) MTTCs were mainly detected in samples with a low degree of thermal
maturity.1−48

Statistics on source rocks and
crude oil samples from which MTTCs
were detected showed that α-MTTC was detected in almost all
source rocks and crude oil samples, while (β+γ)-MTTCs
and δ-MTTCs were detected in most samples (Table 1). ζ-MTTC was only detected
in individual source rock samples (Table 1).

Origins of MTTCs
The origin and
formation mechanisms of MTTCs remain unclear.1,12,16,21 There are
two hypotheses for the origin of MTTCs. δ-MTTC was
probably synthesized through nonphotosynthetic bacteria that was first
proposed by Sinninghe Damsté et al. in 1987,1 suggesting later that MTTCs were biosynthesized via primary
photosynthetic producers,4 although the
direct precursors of MTTCs have not yet been identified. However,
Li et al.21 suggested that MTTCs may derive
from a nonbiosynthetic path by the condensation reaction of alkylated
phenols with phytol during early diagenesis. Jiang et al.3 suggested that MTTCs were likely derived from
photosynthetic organisms and originated in euxinic portions of the
photic zones (PZE) not in the upper parts of water columns or bottom
waters. The variations in paleosalinity that occur in the PZE perhaps
have an important impact on the growth of MTTC-producing organisms
and abundance of MTTCs (Figure 4). Previous studies focused on searching evidences for the
biogenetic hypothesis of MTTCs by comparing the geochemical parameters
obtained from MTTCs and other biomarkers (e.g., distribution, relative
abundance, quantitative concentrations, and δ13C
values)9,17 and the lack of positive studies on whether
microorganisms contain MTTCs living in saline environments today.

model illustrating the biosynthetic origin of MTTCs.
MTTCs were suggested derived from photosynthetic organisms and originate
in euxinic portions of photic zones (PZE). The organisms that produce
MTTCs thrive under the conditions of PZE. Algae and terrigenous organisms
occur in the upper part of the water column (modified after Tulipani
et al.9 and Jiang et al.3). “Reprinted with permission from Jiang, Lin, Zhang,
Cai, Xiao, He, and Peng (2018). Copyright 2018 Elsevier”

In the previous research work,
stable carbon isotope analysis was
suggested to be a facile and reliable way to investigate the origin
of MTTCs.22 Tulipani et al. suggested that
MTTCs may originate from condensation reactions by comparing the stable
carbon isotope values in pyrolysis products generated from α-MTTC
by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (PY-GC-irMS).9 The similar stable carbon isotope ratios among
monomethyl (δ-MTTC), dimethyl (β-MTTC, γ-MTTC, ζ-MTTC),
and trimethyl (α-MTTC) isomers and comparison with other biomarkers
likely suggest that MTTCs may originate from the same biological source,
most likely from photosynthetic bacteria.29 While, Hong et al.6 and Zhang et al.23 suggested that δ-MTTC and dimethyl-MTTCs
were of algal biogenesis origin instead of bacterial origin. The above
controversial conclusions show us that we may need to pay more attention
to the research of the stable carbon isotope of MTTCs and develop
new analytical methods. We suggested that the precise analysis of
the stable carbon isotope of MTTCs would still be an approach to shed
new light on the origin of MTTCs.

Tulipani et al.9 proposed that MTTCs
in Devonian rock samples from the Canning Basin form via condensation
reactions of phytoplankton derived from phytol with high plant phenols
(Figure 5). However,
Dutta et al.39 found that MTTCs in Neoproterozoic
to Early Cambrian crude oil samples were derived from the Bikaner-Nagaur
Basin. The high plant began to appear in the Late Silurian,49 so there are no high plant phenols in Neoproterozoic
to Early Cambrian source rocks. The MTTCs in Neoproterozoic to Early
Cambrian crude oils cannot be explained by the condensation reaction
of phytoplankton-derived phytol with high plant phenols (Figure 5). Hence, the controversy
over the origins and formation mechanisms of MTTCs will continue.

Figure 5 Example
of the controversy over the origin of MTTCs. MTTCs in Devonian
sediments from the Canning Basin were suggested to be formed via condensation
reactions of phytoplankton-derived phytol with higher plant phenols
(Tulipani et al.9).

Palaeosalinity Reconstruction
The paleosalinity was suggested
as the most important factor influencing
the changes in the relative abundances of MTTCs,1 especially the relative abundance of α-MTTC and δ-MTTC.50,51 Hence, the α/δ-MTTC ratio and the MTTCI value were established
to indicate paleosalinity.1 Low α/δ-MTTC
ratios (<2) or low MTTCI values (<0.5 or 0.4) reflect high-salinity
condition, while high α/δ-MTTC ratios (>100) or high
MTTCI
values (>0.5 or 0.4) reflect the relative low-salinity condition.1,2,4,8 Variations
in the abundance of δ-MTTC and α-MTTC show a high sensitivity
to paleosalinity changes compared to (β+γ)-MTTC.3 Therefore, the controlling factors of changes
in the abundance of (β+γ)-MTTCs may require further research.
Also, the rule of the variation in the abundance of ζ-MTTC in
source rocks is still poorly understood. MTTCs are very rare in normal
marine sediments.12 Therefore, the occurrence
of MTTCs, particularly δ-MTTC, may indicate higher salinity
than the normal marine sedimentes.

In immaturity and low-maturity
source rocks or crude oils, except
for organic sources, the pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratio is mainly
affected by the redox conditions in the sedimentary environments.52 The Pr/Ph ratio is commonly used to reflect
redox conditions in the sedimentary environments. Low Pr/Ph ratios
(<0.8) reflect anoxic conditions and the increased probability
of high salinity in the sedimentary environments, while high Pr/Ph
ratios (>3.0) reflect oxic to suboxic conditions and the increased
probability of low salinity. However, Pr/Ph ratios ranging from 0.8
to 3.0 are not proposed for directly indicating redox conditions.52 A diagram of MTTCI values versus Pr/Ph ratios
was built to estimate the salinity levels in the depositional environments.
According to Schwark et al.14 and Wang
et al.,13 the paleosalinity can be divided
into four grades: the hypersaline environments have salinities of
>120‰; mesosaline environments have salinities of ∼40
to 120‰; normal marine-like saline environments have salinities
from ∼30 to 40‰; and semi-saline to freshwater environments
have salinities from ∼1 to 30‰. As shown in Figure 6a, a positive correlation
was observed between MTTCI values and Pr/Ph ratios, which further
confirms that the paleosalinity is the main factor for the low Pr/Ph
ratio.

Figure 6 (a) MTTCI values versus pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios showing
the inferred paleosalinity differences for rock samples. (b) Ternary
plot of mono-, di-, and trimethyl-MTTCs for rock samples from the
Western Qaidam,23 Jianghan,20 and Northern part of the offshore Bohai Bay
Basin,24 which were deposited in hypersaline,
mesosaline to hypersaline, and normal marine to semi-saline environments,
respectively. The direction of the arrow in the figure represents
an increase in salinity from brackish water to hypersaline environments.

In addition to the abovementioned
chart that has been widely used
(Figure 6a), the ternary
diagram of mono-, di-, and trimethyl-MTTCs was established to indicate
the variation in the paleosalinity (Figure 6b).24 The differences
in the paleosalinity of the rock samples obtained from the Western
Qaidam,23 Jianghan,20 and Northern Bohai Bay Basins24 were clearly illustrated by the ternary diagram (Figure 6b), which were deposited in
hypersaline, mesosaline to hypersaline, and normal marine to semi-saline
environments, respectively. Therefore, the ternary diagram of the
relative abundance of MTTCs can also be used to reconstruct paleosalinity.

Outlook
There are still many challenges in the study of the origin and
paleosalinity significance of MTTCs. Among these, the research of
the origin of MTTCs is the most difficult, and there have been no
new breakthroughs in recent years. In future research works, we may
need to focus more on integrated research, such as a closer integration
with paleontology and inorganic geochemistry, and new ideas are needed.
The paleosalinity significance of MTTCs is also worthy of further
research. For example, the validity and applicability of MTTC parameters
in paleosalinity reconstruction will be further clarified by the study
of the correlation between MTTC parameters and inorganic geochemical
parameters. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
the MTTC parameters in paleosalinity reconstruction by comparing MTTC
parameters with other organic geochemical parameters but with lack
of comparison with inorganic geochemical parameters. Therefore, the
lack of the comparison study may reduce the reliability of MTTC parameters
in paleosalinity reconstruction.

Conclusions
From
this review, it is clear that MTTC parameters have become
important indicators for paleosalinity reconstruction in the field
of organic geochemistry. This is particularly encouraging in view
of the outstanding issues, which remain with respect to the origin
and paleosalinity significance of MTTCs. For example, more in-depth
research of paleosalinity significance of MTTCs by way of comparing
MTTC parameters with inorganic geochemical parameters will probably
reveal more paleoenvironmental information than presently known. As
the increase in comprehensive research centered on MTTCs, opportunities
will arise to gain new understandings about the origin and formation
mechanism of MTTCs. Finally, an improved understanding of the organic
geochemistry of MTTCs will further promote their application as paleoenvironmental
proxies.
