Amine
compounds are considered highly important in environmental
pollution, industrial, and medicinal fields. The objective of this
work was to develop a disposable, highly accurate, highly selective,
and low-cost paper-based probe through the combination of color change
of seven pH indicators for the detection of amine compounds in the
gaseous state. The probe was designed with seven rings which were
printed using the wax-printing technique and colored with different
pH indicators. The colors of the probe were analyzed using red, green,
and blue (RGB) values extracted from the images obtained
with a homemade smartphone application. The chemometric tools, principal
component analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis methods were
adapted to further classify amine gases. The colorimetric probe showed
an excellent capability for detecting the amines with high accuracy,
prompt response, and high selectivity. These dye arrays have been
proven to detect ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH), dimethylamine ((CH3)2NH), and trimethylamine
((CH3)3N) gases at parts per million scale.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The broad range of using
amine and amine-related compounds in industrial
and medicinal applications makes it significantly urgent to understand
the associated risks and concerns for leaking these compounds into
the aquatic environment. The family of amines containing secondary
and tertiary amines and quaternary amine salts can be important for
the formation of several toxic compounds.1 The amines and amine degradation products are carcinogenic compounds
and may be found in drinking water supplies and can pose potential
risks for whole communities with resulting public health issues.2 Ethanolamine (EA, a primary amine) is the most
commonly used solvent for designing to capture and store CO2 from combustion flue gases (or postcombustion capture).3,4 However, this choice often results in potential health risks and
environmental problems related to by-products or degradation products
such as nitrosamines and nitramines in the atmosphere and water ecosystem.
Moreover, the biogenic amines are formed through the decarboxylation
of amino acids or by the amination of ketones and aldehydes in plants
or living organisms, and they may cause strong tastes and smells.
For example, diethylamine (DET) and trimethylamine (TMA) are typical
by-products of the breakdown of amino acids through the decaying process
in the protein-rich tissues of fish.5,6 The amine compounds
are widespread in aquatic environments and directly associated with
many natural and industrial sources.

Several analytical approaches
for the detection of amines have
been developed in recent decades by using modern instrumentations,
such as capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE–MS),7 MS,8 and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC),9 and well
documented in the literature.6 These methods
are among the most important methods for precise quantitative analysis
but they are often time-consuming and require tedious sample pretreatment,
high cost, and considerable skill. In addition, they use potential
toxic organic solvents of HPLC grade quality. The immune-enzymatic
methods can also be applied for routine analysis with semiquantitative
determination of biogenic amines.10,11 However, the
chemical analysis of amines in environmental samples poses particular
challenges and obstacles: namely high volatility, low limit of detection
(LOD), low molecular weight, and chemical instability.12 Therefore, it is urgent and desirable to develop
more sensitive and effective methods for amine detection without complex
analyzing procedures in complex environment matrices.

The development
of inexpensive analytical methods allowing real
time to distinguish between different types of volatile compounds
is of great interest. Among them, paper-based analytical devices (PADs)
have rapidly developed in recent years because of low-cost and easy-to-use
analytical tools.13 They are widely reported
in point-of-care systems, environmental areas, and food contamination.14−16 PADs present several advantages, such as an inexpensive device and
reliable measurements with speed and efficiency using small volumes
of sample solutions, over other analytical methods. Moreover, their
simplicity lies in the creation of hydrophilic microchannels on cellulose
and polymers by mean of different hydrophobic patterning materials,
such as wax, inks, and polymers.17,18 To date, the
combination of PADs with traditional analytical instruments such as
MS, CE, and electrochemical devices offers an interesting approach
to the implementation of cost-effective biochemical analysis.19,20 Based on the colorimetric approach, some groups used a single color
spot on a polymer substrate for monitoring food quality.21−23

As mentioned above, single compounds can be monitored with
single
color spots but it is impossible in case of complex compounds. To
overcome this drawback, colorimetric sensors based on color spot matrixes
were proposed using chemometric tools for discriminating compounds.24,25 For example, Bueno’s group used a plastic-based device and
chemometric for discriminating triethylamine, isobutylamine, and isopentylamine
using Alizin, bromophenol blue, chlorophenol red, methyl red, and
thymol blue. Chemometrics is closely related to statistics and mathematics,
where the chemical information and correlation quality parameters
are extracted to analyze chemical data. The chemometric tools give
the relationships between the variables and samples and convert into
new dormant variables.26,27 Until now, the chemometric tools
have been developed or integrated in commercial software, such as
R-software, MATLAB, SPSS, Origin, and Microsoft Excel.

Here,
we develop a simple, disposable, and low-cost disposable
colorimetric paper-based probe (DCP) based on seven popular commercial
pH indicators, where the change range of pH of array is in the range
of 3–8.8, on the paper for detecting EA (NH2CH2CH2OH), dimethylamine ((CH3)2NH), and TMA ((CH3)3N) by coupling chemometric
tools and colorimetric sensing with smartphones. The use of smartphones
as a tool in chemical analysis based on a colorimetric approach has
been attracted an increased attention because of its portability and
big portion of users and has opened up the opportunities for creating
new, highly reliable, fast, and online analytical tools.28−30 The built-in camera in smartphones captures color changes for the
analytical process. Subsequently, color changes are processed using
the algorithms based on hue and saturation coordinates of the HSV
(hue, saturation, and value) color space or dominant changed R (red), G (green), and B (blue) colors for getting results. In the best of our knowledge,
the studies on gas sensors have been almost performed with the electrochemical
sensing approach. We designed the DCP with seven rings on the paper,
which were printed by the wax-printing technique and colored with
the pH indicators. Images of the spots in DCP were taken with the
built-in camera of a smartphone, and then the red, green, and blue
(RGB) values were recorded with the home-made Android
application. Chemometric tools in Microsoft Excel software were used
to analyze the color change of spots on the DCP using principal component
analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). These DCPs
are able to distinguish between the different amine-containing gases
and show no observable responses to the change in humidity at room
temperature.

2 Results and Discussion
It is known that the colors of pH indicators depend on their protonated
and deprotonated forms originating from the modification of the structural
indicator through a protonate/deprotonate process. Figure 1 displays the color change
profiles of the DCP under amine gas exposure, namely EA, dimethylamine,
and TMA. The color change of each spot on the array was observed clearly
to discriminate each other depending on the amine species. This difference
can be explained by different proton-donating properties of the amines.
The pKa values of EA, dimethylamine, and
TMA are 9.40, 10.73, and 9.81, respectively. However, the color changes
of the pH indicators were sometimes so more delicate that it does
not reach the extreme color for the full acidic or basic form.31

Figure 1 Color changes of the DCP before and after amine gas exposure.

To overcome this limitation, the RGB values of
the color spot were recorded using a smartphone application. Each
image of an array was presented by 21 values (each array consists
of seven dyes and three color values for each dye). These values can
be used as an input of the nonsupervised pattern recognition methods
(PCA and HCA).31 PCA is used to evaluate
the pattern recognition or the qualitative discrimination through
orthogonal directions in the variable space. PCA decreases the number
of variables by creating orthogonal eigenvectors (PC1 and PC2). HCA
shows a genealogical tree of the samples where the algorithm aims
to partition n samples into clusters in which each
sample belongs to the cluster based on the linkage distance. The linkage
distance determines the distance between pairs of observations or
samples. The results from the chemometric analysis PCA and HCA methods
are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 (a) PCA score plot obtained through the RGB values
extracted from seven colored spots in contact with three different
amines [(I) EA, (II) dimethylamine, (III) TMA], (b) HCA plot of 21
values with seven different dyes on DCP.

The color change patterns in the spots on DCP were different
according
to the species and concentration of amine gases with an optimum exposure
time of 10 min. The PCA score plot did not change for elongating the
exposure time in excess of 10 min (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2a, first two principal
components (PC1 and PC2) exhibited that each amine can be classified
into a single group with 71.5% of the total information collected
by the extracted RGB values and made possible to
discriminate among EA, DET, and TMA. Moreover, the HCA plot was performed
through the RGB values extracted from the seven colorimetric
spots on the DCP in contact with each of three different amines to
also confirm no misclassifications among all amines too (Figure 2b). Besides that,
the color change of the DCP with changing amine gas concentration
can also be observed with a HCA graph (Figure 3).

Figure 3 HCA plots were obtained from the RGB values extracted
from the seven color spots after exposing with the different concentrations
of (a) EA, (b) dimethylamine, and (c) triethylamine.

To confirm the change of RGB values
versus EA
concentration, we chose one spot, where it is difficult to observe
the change of color by naked-eyes. Figure 4 shows the relationship between RGB values and EA concentration in spot 6. It is clear that there are
good linearity between R, G values
and EA concentration. This result also suggests that RGB values can be used for the determination of amine concentrations.
To demonstrate the versatility of the DCP, calibration curves were
constructed using Euclidean distance (ED) values,32,33 which can be expressed by eq 1 1  where (ΔR)i2 is variation
of R value
of dyes and (ΔG)i2 and (ΔB)i2 have the same meaning for G and B values, respectively.

Figure 4 Relationship between EA concentration
and (a) R, (b) G, and (c) B values for the
spot number 6 (number of trials = 5).

The ED values using Microsoft Excel in analysis process of
PCA
and HCA are a function of amine concentrations of all spots on DCP.
The ED values linearly enhanced with increasing of amine concentrations
in range of 1–250 ppm, as shown in Figure 5. The LODs of the DCPs were calculated to
be 0.4, 0.2, and 0.5 ppm for EA, DET, and TMA, respectively. The LOD
values are comparable as those of other reports such as arrays of
chemoresponsive dyes,34 chemiresistive
detectors using single-wall carbon nanotube–porphyrin complex,35 colorimetric array,36 CE–MS,7 and HPLC using a dispersive
liquid–liquid microextraction process.37 Compared with the LOD of proton-transfer reaction quadrupole mass
spectrometer,8 the LOD of this DCP is not
better than those but the proposed DCP does not require any synthetic
process of chemicals and any expensive equipment except smartphone
and computer and skilled personnel.

Figure 5 ED values vs amine concentrations. The
relationship between colorimetric
response of DCP and three amines: (a) EA, (b) DET, and (c) TMA.

The experiments for selectivity
were carried out for EA, DET, TMA,
and some common volatile organic solvents (VOCs). The results showed
that DCP did not respond (the colors of DCP did not change) with common
VOCs, namely acetone, methanol, ethanol, benzene, chloroform, toluene,
and dimethylformamide, at 1000 ppm vapor concentrations of these VOCs.
However, the proposed DCP cannot apply for strong basic (e.g., ammonia)
or acidic (e.g., H2S) solutions. Figure 6a exhibits color perceptivity of DCP for
each amine and mixed three amines (at 100 ppm vapor concentration
of each amine). The corresponding data of PCA score plot also exhibited
the difference (Figure 6b), where the mixed three amines were classified into other group.
Although PCA score plot and the color of DCP are different between
un-mixed amines and mixed amines but it is not easy for calculating
specific concentration of each amines. These results imply that our
probe can be used for the selective detection of EA, DET, and TMA
without any interference of common VOCs.

exposing EA, DET, TMA, and mixed three

three amines.

2.1 Analysis
of Real Samples
To evaluate
the feasibility of the proposed probe for real samples, recovery tests
of each individual amine were conducted using aquatic sediments. By
using a spiked method, excellent recoveries of 94.8–108.7%
were obtained, as shown in Table 1. These data suggest that the proposed sensor will
be applicable to the analysis of amine gases in water samples. This
method also showed acceptable repeatability (relative standard deviation)
in the range of 0.91–3.70%.

3 Conclusions
In this work, a simple, disposable, and low-cost colorimetric probe
is presented based on paper substrate for detecting gaseous state
of EA, dimethylamine, and TMA compounds with high accuracy and selectivity.
The dyes’ color changes by the individual amine compounds were
analyzed using RGB values extracted from images obtained
with a homemade smartphone application. To classify amine gases, the
chemometric tools including PCA and HCA methods were used. The proposed
DCP has been proven to detect EA, dimethylamine, and TMA gases at
parts per million scale. The proposed DCP was applied for real samples
with high recoveries. Our developed array system has a potential to
be able to provide an early warning of natural gas pollution.

4 Experiment Section
4.1 Chemicals, Materials, and
Instrumentation
Bromophenol blue, methyl red, bromocresol
green, disperse orange
3, bromocresol purple, fluorescein, and cresol red were purchased
from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation (Osaka, Japan). EA, DET,
and TMA were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. (Great Britain). All other
reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. For the fabrication
of the DCP, Whatman chromatography paper grade 1 (200 × 200 mm,
pure cellulose paper) was obtained from GE Healthcare (China). The
designed DCPs were printed on a sheet of Whatman grade #1 using a
wax printer (ColoQube 8570DN, Xerox, USA) followed by heating at 120
°C for 2 min on a drying machine. Wax ink was used for the paper
hydrophobization and an insulation agent in this work.

The DCP
consisted of circles with an inside diameter of 5 mm and a border
of 2 mm (after melting wax ink). To prepare the DCP, the circles were
filled with 10 μL of 0.10 mM dye solutions and dried for 1 h
at room temperature. The colors of the DCP were recorded with a smartphone.
The spots on DCP with different dyes were assigned as shown in Figure 7.

position and color profile of each dye spot

4.2 Sample
Measurement
Amine vapors were
generated by heating amine liquids in a filtering flask and carried
by pure nitrogen flow (flow rate of 30 sccm) through a tube using
a mass flow controller (GMATE2000A, Lokas Co., Ltd., Korea). The end
of the tube was immersed in the amine solution inside the filtering
flask. The generated amine gas from the flask was collected in a gas-sampling
bag (FEP gas sampling bag with capacity of 0.5 L, Sigma-Aldrich),
as shown in Scheme 1. The volumes of liquid amines and nitrogen gas were calculated to
prepare standard amine gas samples with various concentrations by
following our previous report.38

Scheme 1 Preparation
of Standard Amine Gas Samples in Gas-Sampling Bags
For sensing amine gases, the DCP was placed
in the sensing chamber
connected to the gas-sampling bag. The temperature around the chamber
was kept at room temperature. The smartphone was used to get images
of the DCP before and after amine exposure. All measurements were
performed five times.

4.3 Real Sample Application
Amine-polluted
waters may be caused by by-products from industry or degradation products
from microorganisms and aquatic organisms in the water ecosystem.
To evaluate the prepared DCP for practical application, aquatic sediments
from a water source of the Changwon River, Changwon City, Korea were
obtained. The collected water samples were filtered by filter paper
before they were spiked. Specific volumes of amine gases with known
concentrations were mixed with water samples, which were contained
in closed bottles. The gases from the samples were released by heating
the bottle and then transferred to the DCP. The RGB values were collected after the prepared probes were exposed to
the gas.

4.4 Data Processing and Analysis on Paper Base
To achieve effective data processing for colorimetric sensor arrays,
it was necessary to convert these different obtained-color maps for
each analysis to RGB values using a home-made Android
smartphone application. These RGB values were extracted
at the center of every single spots (15 × 15 pixels) before and
after the exposure to the samples. The software used a 256-bit color
scale with white corresponding to a color intensity of 255, 255, and
255 and black corresponding to a color intensity of 0, 0, and 0.

To evaluate the ability for the colorimetric DCP to discriminate
different analytes, two chemometric tools were used to process input
data of RGB values: (i) PCA evaluates the variance
in the array response among the range of analytes; (ii) HCA divides
the analytes into discrete groups based on the characteristics of
their respective responses. HCA forms dendrograms based on the clustering
of array response data in the dimensional ΔRGB color space.36
