Collagen
is the most abundant extracellular matrix protein. The concentrations,
structural arrangement, and directionality of collagen depend on the
type of tissue. Thick fibril bundles of collagen are observed in most
collagenous tissues, including connective tissues, bones, and tendons,
indicating that they play a critical role in many cell functions.
In this study, we developed a new method to regulate collagen bundling
without altering the protein concentration, temperature, or pH by
using sodium sulfate to replicate bundled collagen fibrils found in
vivo. Microstructure analysis revealed that both the thickness of
the fibril bundles and the pore size of the matrix increased with
the amount of sodium sulfate. In contrast, there was no significant
change in the bulk mechanical stiffness of the collagen matrix. The
modified collagen bundle matrix was used to investigate the responses
of human cervical cancer cells by mimicking the extracellular environments
of a tumor. Compared to the normal collagen matrix, cells on the collagen
bundle matrix exhibited significant changes in morphology, with a
reduced cell perimeter and aspect ratio. The cell motility, which
was analyzed in terms of the speed of migration and mean squared displacement,
decreased for the collagen bundle matrix. Additionally, the critical
time taken for the peak turning angle to converge to 90° decreased,
indicating that the migration direction was regulated by geometric
cues provided by collagen bundles rather than by the intrinsic cell
persistence. The experimental results imply that collagen bundles
play an important role in determining the magnitude and direction
in cancer cell migration. The proposed method of extracellular matrix
modification can be applied to investigate various cellular behaviors
in both physiological and pathological environments.

==== Body
Introduction
Collagen is the most
abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in many types of tissues,
including skin, ligaments, corneas, blood vessels, and cartilage.
Its structural form and arrangement depend on the type of tissue.1−4 Cellular functions such as proliferation, adhesion, and migration
are significantly affected by the microstructure of the collagen fibril
matrix, which is characterized by the fibril diameter, pore size,
and stiffness.5−9 Collagen fibrils in a bundle form are found in most of collagenous
tissues. Densely packed collagen bundles are present in bones. The
main constituents of connective tissues, including tendons and ligaments,
are collagen bundles arranged along the longitudinal axis. The collagen
fibrils surrounding tumors are transformed into bundles and aligned
as a tumor-associated collagen signature.10,11 Therefore, understanding collagen bundling is essential for the
study of cellular responses in both physiological and pathological
biomimetic environments.

The assembly of collagen fibrils can
be modulated by the temperature and pH during the self-assembly process.12,13 The hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond forces between
collagen molecules during their self-assembly process depend on the
temperature.14,15 The binding kinetics and hydrophobic
attractive force of collagen molecules depend on the temperature.12,16 Thick collagen bundles were observed when collagens were formed
at temperatures in the range of 4–24 °C.15,17 The pH is critical in determining the degree of ionization of the
collagen surface charges18 and maintaining
the stability of the triple-helical conformation of collagen fibrils.19 In an experiment where collagen was self-assembled
under various pH conditions, the thickness of the collagen fibrils
increased with a reduction in the pH.20,21 Additionally,
the characteristic length of D-banding in collagen fibrils was affected
by the pH owing to the abundance of basic residues in the overlap
zone.19 Previous studies suggest that the
self-assembly conditions are critical in determining the structural
organization of collagen.

The assembly of collagen fibrils into
bundles was regulated by the ionic strength of the buffer for fibrillogenesis.22 The electrostatic interactions dictated the
conformation of fibril structures by shifting the isoelectric point
of collagen molecules, which depended on the type of ion species.23,24 Multivalent ions such as phosphate and sulfate were reported to
exhibit a high binding affinity to collagen molecules.22,25 In particular, sulfates, which are widely present in body fluids,
significantly affect the structural properties of the ECM.25 Li and Douglas revealed that the interaction
of salts and collagen triple helices altered the fibril structure
through the screening of amino acids.23 However, it is still unclear how the cellular behaviors are modulated
by collagen fibril matrices formed under various electrostatic conditions.

In this study, we developed a technique to regulate the assembly
of collagen bundles from fibrils by incorporating sodium sulfate during
fibrillogenesis of collagen while maintaining the same temperature
and pH as the physiological environment. We demonstrated that collagen
fibrils were assembled into thick bundles by adding sodium sulfate
dissolved in the neutralized solution. While both the bundle thickness
and pore size of the collagen matrix increased with the amount of
sodium sulfate, the matrix stiffness did not exhibit a significant
change. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed that collagen bundling with sodium sulfate
did not alter the process of collagen fibril formation. We investigated
the behavior of human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) on collagen bundle
networks mimicking the ECM environment found in metastatic tumors.
When the HeLa cells were cultured on the regulated collagen bundle
network, the cell morphology was significantly altered, with a reduced
cell perimeter and aspect ratio. A migration assay revealed that the
cell motility decreased with regard to the migration distance, speed,
end-to-end distance, effective velocity, and mean squared displacement.
However, the critical time taken for the peak turning angle to converge
to 90° decreased, indicating that the geometric cue produced
by the collagen bundles suppressed the intrinsic cell migration persistence.
Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of how different
forms of collagen bundles are formed depending on the self-assembly
conditions and how they regulate the cell migration. The collagen
modification technique can be applied to elucidate the mechanism of
various cell behaviors under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Results
and Discussion
Modification of Collagen Fibrils To Form
Bundles Using Sodium Sulfate
The formation of collagen fibrils
depends on the fibrillogenesis conditions, such as the temperature,
pH, and electrostatic interactions.17,26,27 Screening of surface charges of collagen molecules
by bound ion alters the collagen fibril formation kinetics, which
depend on the type of ion.12,23 In order to regulate
the collagen fibril structure by the electrostatic conditions, we
used sodium sulfate, which was reported to have a strong binding affinity
to collagen molecules.28 The sodium sulfate
was prepared by neutralizing sulfuric acid using sodium hydroxide
as given in eq 1. 1  

In this study,
a collagen matrix was prepared with neutralized sulfuric acid, which
was denoted as the “N-solution” to prevent an alteration
of the fibril structure due to a change in pH (Figure 1a). The amount of sodium sulfate added to
the collagen solution was regulated to be proportional to the volume
of the N-solution. We found that individual collagen fibrils were
assembled into bundles when formed in the presence of the N-solution
(Figure 1b). In our
experiments, the salt concentration was higher than that required
for the self-assembly of collagen molecules during fibrillogenesis.
An excess amount of sulfate can bind and accumulate at the positively
charged sites in collagen.25,28 The electrostatic interaction
between individual collagen fibrils may play a role in the assembly
of fibrils into bundles. Additionally, the bundling of collagen fibrils
is attributed to changes in the kinetics of fibrillogenesis. The presence
of salt ions can reduce the thermal stability, which is critical for
the assembly of collagen molecules during nucleation or growth through
the entropy-driven fibril assembly mechanism.29,30 Similar bundled matrices of collagen were obtained when different
types of salts, such as sodium acetate and sodium chloride, were used
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).
However, the bundling degree appeared to be lower compared to that
for sodium sulfate. These results indicate that collagen bundling
via salt is not specific to sodium sulfate and depends on both the
species and strength of salt ions.

sulfate. (a) Compared to the normal collagen preparation, an acid-based
neutralized solution (N-solution) is added to modify the fibril structure
and promote bundling in our method. (b) SEM images comparing normal
collagen fibrils (top) to bundles (bottom) formed by adding the N-solution
containing sodium sulfate. The scale bars represent 500 nm.

In Vitro Reconstitution of Collagen Matrices
with Tunable Fibril Assembly
The entire morphology of the
collagen matrix composed of transformed collagen bundles was examined
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence microscopy
(FM). The concentrations of N-solution in the collagen solution were
determined by the volume ratios of the N-solution to the collagen
solution. They were 5, 20, and 50% of the total volume. In the absence
of the N-solution, the collagen matrix was isotropic, consisting of
individual fibrils without bundles (Figure 2a), as reported previously.17,31 In contrast, for the collagen matrix prepared in the presence of
the N-solution, bundles of collagen fibrils were observed. FM images
revealed that the pores of the matrix became larger as collagens fibrils
were assembled into bundles at higher N-solution concentrations (Figure 2b). The diameter
of the fibrils or bundles (D) increased with the
N-solution concentration (CN), thereby
exhibiting the relationship D ∼≈ CN0.87 (Figure 2c). The thickness of some collagen bundles
at a 50% N-solution concentration was measured to be ∼300 nm,
corresponding to an assembly of approximately six individual fibrils,
according to the thickness of individual fibrils in the collagen matrix
formed without the N-solution. Compared to the normal collagen matrix,
larger pores were observed in the collagen bundle matrix prepared
with the N-solution. The average pore size increased significantly
at N-solution concentrations higher than 20% (Figure 2d). Without changing the collagen concentration,
the bundle thickness and pore size of the collagen matrix were regulated
by changing the amount of N-solution added during fibrillogenesis.
We performed experiments with a different collagen concentration and
obtained a similar result that the size of the collagen bundles increased
with the N-solution concentration (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

matrix. (a) SEM images and (b) FM images of collagen matrices prepared
with various concentrations of N-solution. The scale bars in (a) and

collagen matrices estimated from the F–D curves (n = 3). The scale bar represents
5 mm. The error bars represent the standard deviation. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.005.

To see whether the structural changes of the collagen fibrils altered
the mechanical properties of matrices, the stiffness of the matrices
was estimated using a custom-made indentation apparatus. The elastic
moduli of the collagen matrices were similar in the range of 1–3
kPa, although there was a slight increase in the average value (Figure 2e). This result suggests
that by adding N-solution, the assembly of collagen fibrils was regulated
without changing the mechanical properties of the matrix. At a given
collagen concentration, the matrix stiffness can be determined by
both fibril stiffness and pore size of the matrix. When the collagen
bundling occurs, the fibril stiffness can be increased by bundling.32 However, at the same time, the pore size of
the collagen matrix increases with the bundle thickness as many fibrils
are assembled into a single bundle.12,33,34 The effect of fibril stiffness on matrix stiffness
can be cancelled by that of porosity. Therefore, the elastic modulus
of the collagen matrix did not exhibit a significant change in spite
of the thickening of bundles.

Nanostructure and Chemical
Constituents of Collagen Bundles Matrix
Collagen molecules
are self-assembled into microfibrils in a quarter-staggered manner
to form collagen fibrils. Therefore, the nanostructure of collagen
fibrils is characterized by D-banding, which refers to the periodic
patterns formed during the collagen fibril organization. To determine
whether the N-solution modification altered the collagen microfibril
organization, the topography of the collagen fibril or bundle was
examined using AFM.35−37 We observed similar repeating patterns regardless
of N-solution addition, as indicated by both the AFM images and amplitude
profiles along the fibrils in those images (Figure 3a). By measuring the distance between the
peaks in the amplitude profiles, the length of D-banding was measured
to be 69, 68, and 69 nm for collagen bundles with N-solution concentrations
of 5, 20, and 50%, respectively (Figure 3b). These results are consistent with the
values measured for normal collagen fibrils in previous studies.38−40

The scale bars represent 200 nm. (b) D-banding estimated from the
amplitude profiles at various N-solution concentrations. (c) FT-IR
spectra for collagen without the N-solution and with 50% N-solution.

We also analyzed the chemical bonds of collagen
matrices using FT-IR spectrometry. Collagen matrices are characterized
by the amides A, I, and II (Figure 3c).41−43 In our measurements, the N–H group of amide
A was identified by a peak at 3434 cm–1. Peaks at
1655 and 1637 cm–1 corresponding to amide I and
peaks at 1560 and 1557 cm–1 corresponding to amide
II were observed in the collagen fibril matrix (0% N-solution) and
collagen bundle matrix (50% N-solution), respectively (Figure 3c). The strong peak at 1130
cm–1 was exhibited only for 50% N-solution, which
was attributed to the S=O symmetric stretching vibration generated
in SO42– of the N-solution. These common
peaks observed in the FT-IR spectra indicate that the chemical bonds
were conserved regardless of N-solution addition. Therefore, the collagen
bundles formed by the N-solution could have been an assembly of intact
collagen fibrils exhibiting D-banding rather than irregular aggregates
of collagen monomers. The AFM and FT-IR spectroscopy results indicated
that the addition of the N-solution did not alter the process of collagen
fibril formation from monomers and instead promoted the assembly of
fibrils into bundles.

Morphological Changes in HeLa Cells by Collagen
Structure Modification
To investigate the effects of the
structural modification of collagen on cellular behaviors, HeLa cells
were cultured on the surface of a collagen matrix (Figure 4a). The cell viability test
performed at 48 h after seeding confirmed that the collagen modified
by the N-solution was nontoxic (Figure 4b). Cells on the collagen bundle matrix prepared with
the N-solution exhibited a relatively spherical and amoeboid morphology,
whereas cells on the normal collagen fibril matrix exhibited a spreading
and mesenchymal morphology. A quantitative analysis revealed that
the cell area, perimeter, and aspect ratio decreased for cells cultured
on the collagen bundle matrices prepared with the N-solution (Figure S3a in the Supporting Information). Compared
to the normal collagen, the cell areas decreased by 13 and 4% at 20
and 50% N-solution, respectively (Figure 4c and Figure S3b in the Supporting Information). The cell perimeters decreased by
17 and 11% at 20 and 50% N-solution, respectively, due to the reduction
of lamellipodia formation (Figure 4d and Figure S3b in the
Supporting Information). For the normal collagen, the aspect ratio
of the cells was estimated to be 2.0 ± 0.8. However, the cells
on the collagen bundle matrix exhibited a reduced aspect ratio of
1.8 ± 0.8 at 50% N-solution (Figure 4e and Figure S3b in the Supporting Information), which is consistent with the morphological
observation that the cells were more circular than elongated. The
results indicate that the microstructural architecture of the extracellular
matrix, such as the fibril or bundle dimensions and pore size, significantly
affects the cell morphology. Regarding the nucleus morphology, there
was no significant difference in size or orientation between the cells
on the normal and bundled collagen matrices (Figure S3c–e in the Supporting Information).

bars represent the standard deviation. *P < 0.05
and **P < 0.005.

ECM fibers provide adhesion sites for cells, and cells can recruit
fibers around the cells.44 We studied the
interaction of cells with collagen fibrils or bundles in the matrix
by visualizing collagen fibrils and cell lamellipodia. For the normal
collagen matrix, we observed the co-alignment of collagen fibrils
with filopodia and the thickening of recruited fibrils, thereby indicating
collagen remodeling. In contrast, there was little interaction between
filopodia and collagen bundles in the presence of an N-solution (Figure 4f). The results indicate
that the ECM remodeling by the cells was reduced for the bundled matrix,
which is consistent with a previous study involving temperature-modulated
collagen bundles.32 These results may explain
why the cells on the bundle matrix with the N-solution exhibited a
more circular morphology with less spreading compared to those on
the normal collagen matrix.

Cell Dynamics Regulated by the Collagen Bundle
Matrix
To investigate how the dynamic behaviors of cells
were altered by the collagen bundle matrix, we monitored the migratory
behavior of HeLa cells for 3 h and 30 min and characterized the migratory
trajectory (Figure 5a, Movies S1 and S2). Images were captured every 10 min, which was
short enough to resolve the cell movement at the micrometer scale
according to the cell speed. A comparison of the x–y position, which was tracked during the
same period, revealed that the cells on the collagen bundle matrix
exhibited less movement than those on the normal collagen fibril matrix
(Figure 5b). The travel
distance for the entire period was calculated to be 104 μm for
the collagen fibril matrix. It was reduced to 90 and 83 μm when
cells were cultured on collagen bundle matrices at 20 and 50% N-solution,
respectively (Figure 5c). The reduced motility was manifested by a reduction in the migration
speed during the time interval. The average migration speed of HeLa
on the collagen fibril matrix was estimated to be 0.5 μm/min.
For the collagen bundle matrix modified by 20 and 50% N-solution,
the average cell speed decreased by 14 and 20%, respectively (Figure 5d). While the end-to-end
distance increased continuously during the experiment for the collagen
fibril matrix, that for the modified collagen bundle matrix appeared
to reach a plateau at long time scales (Figure 5e). Therefore, the effective velocity estimated
over the entire period was significantly lower for the collagen bundle
matrix than for the collagen fibril matrix (Figure 5f). The reductions in the migration speed
and motility might be attributed to the limited focal adhesion formation
as observed previously for cells on thick collagen bundles.32

of MSD with respect to the time lag. (h) Turning angle (θ) defined
in the cell trajectory. θ = 180° indicates that the cells
migrate in a straight direction, suggesting a high migration persistence.
As the persistence is disturbed, θ decreases. (i) Turning angle

20, and 60 min. (j) Peak turning angles (θp) obtained
from the turning angle distribution as a function of the time lag.
The error bars represent the standard deviation in (c), (d), (f),
and (j) and standard error of the mean in (e) and (g). *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.005.

The mean squared displacement (MSD) of the cell trajectories for
the normal collagen fibril matrix was significantly larger than that
for the collagen bundle matrix prepared with the N-solution. The reduced
MSD for the collagen bundle matrix was due to the less migratory behavior,
as indicated by the trajectories in Figure 5b. The MSD increased with the time lag, with
an exponential relationship:45 MSD ∼
(time lag Δt)α (Figure 5g). The slope α was 1.4
for the normal collagen fibril matrix. For the collagen bundle matrices,
α values were 1.1 and 1.2 for 20 and 50% N-solution, respectively.
The reduced slope indicated that the migration persistence was reduced
for cells cultured on the collagen bundle matrices.46 According to the MSD results, the migration of the HeLa
cells on the collagen matrix prepared with the N-solution was more
guided although the migration displacement was smaller than that of
the cells on the normal collagen matrix.

In order to investigate
how the modified collagen matrix affected the direction of cell migration,
we defined the turning angle as the change in the migration direction
and analyzed it as a function of the time lag (Figure 5h). A distribution of turning angles at a
given time lag was fitted to a Gaussian function to determine the
peak value of the turning angle. With an increasing time lag, the
distribution of the turning angles became wider and more uniform (Figure 5i). This indicates
that with a long time lag, the correlation of the turning angle was
diminished, and the cell migration directionality was lost. The peak
turning angle (θp) at a short time lag of 10 min
was 110° for the normal collagen matrix. It was estimated to
be reduced to 96 and 95° at 20 and 50% N-solution, respectively
(Figure 5j). At short
time scales, the turning angle should be higher than 90° because
of the persistence of the migratory cells. However, at long time scales,
it decreases and becomes 90° as the persistence disappears. For
the normal collagen matrix, the critical time lag at which the peak
turning angle reached close to 90° was >50 min. The critical
time lags were reduced to approximately 30 and 40 min for 20 and 50%
N-solution, respectively. The peak turning angles of the cells cultured
on the collagen bundle matrix decayed faster than those of the cells
cultured on the collagen fibril matrix. This indicates that the collagen
bundles prepared with the N-solution provided the HeLa cells with
geometric cues to promote a change in the migration direction by reducing
the cell persistence over a relatively short period. Migration of
cancer cells on the collagen matrix accounts for cancer metastasis.
During the metastatic process in vivo, thick and parallel-aligned
collagen bundles were observed.11 We demonstrated
that both the magnitude and direction of cancer cell migration were
altered by the collagen bundles formed with the N-solution. Our method
of collagen modification using sodium sulfate can be applied to a
three-dimensional cell culture platform (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In
order to replicate the collagen bundled structure observed in most
extracellular matrices, we developed a technique to regulate the assembly
of collagen fibrils into bundles by incorporating sodium sulfate during
fibrillogenesis. Microstructure characterization of the modified collagen
matrix revealed that the size of the assembled collagen bundle increased
with the amount of sodium sulfate. The D-banding was investigated
via AFM revealing that sodium sulfate may play a role in joining intact
collagen fibrils together rather than altering the fibrillogenesis
of single fibrils. Fluorescence images of individual cells cultured
on the modified collagen matrix indicated that the bundled collagen
matrix significantly altered the cell morphology, from a mesenchymal
to an amoeboid shape. A quantitative analysis of the dynamic behaviors
of HeLa cells indicated that the motility of the cells was reduced
and their migration persistence was attenuated relatively faster by
the collagen bundles than by the collagen fibrils. These results indicated
that the collagen bundles played a critical role in guiding the migration
direction, as a geometric cue. Our method for regulating collagen
bundling can be applied not only to elucidate the mechanism of cancer
cell behaviors but also to understand the responses of various cells
in collagenous tissues under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Experimental
Section
Modification of Collagen Matrix
Collagen type I from
rat tail in 0.02 N acetic acid was purchased from Corning Inc. (Corning,
USA). A normal collagen fibril matrix was prepared using the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, the collagen solution was mixed with appropriate
amounts of 10× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich,
USA), 1 N sodium hydroxide (Duksan Chemical, Korea), and 20 μM
HEPES (Gibco, USA) to maintain the physiological pH of 7.4. The final
volume was adjusted with deionized water (DI water), and the final
concentration of collagen was 1 mg/mL. The collagen solution was mixed
on ice and self-assembled for 30 min at 37 °C in an incubator.
Modified collagen bundle matrices were prepared by replacing a certain
volume of deionized water with an acid–base neutralized solution
(N-solution), which was obtained by neutralizing 1 N sulfuric acid
with 1 N sodium hydroxide. The final concentration of collagen was
equal to 1 mg/mL, and the final pH was equal to 7.4. The added volumes
of N-solution were 5, 20, and 50% of the final volume of the collagen
solution.

Collagen matrices were formed in a glass-bottom confocal
dish (SPL, Korea) coated with 2 mg/mL dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) dissolved in a 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.5) to help
adhesion between the collagen and glass.47

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Collagen matrices were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science, USA)
for 1 h. Samples were washed twice with 1× PBS and three times
with deionized water for 10 min each. Collagen matrices were dehydrated
in a graded series of 30, 50, 70, and 100% ethanol solutions for 15
min in each solution.27 Samples were incubated
in 50 and 100% hexamethyldisilazane for 15 min each.48 After drying overnight, samples were examined using SEM
(JEOL, Japan). The DiameterJ plugin in ImageJ was used to measure
the diameters of collagen fibrils or bundles in the matrix.

Fluorescence
Imaging (FM) of Collagen Matrix
The collagen solution was
labeled by incubating it with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for
2 h, as described previously.47 An inverted
confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) was employed
to examine the collagen matrix using a 20× objective. A customized
code developed in MATLAB was used to estimate the pore size of the
matrix using a fluorescence image.

Characterization of Mechanical
Properties of the Collagen Matrix
To characterize the bulk
mechanical properties of the collagen matrices, a custom-made indentation
apparatus consisting of a load cell (Transducer Techniques, USA) and
an automated stage (ST1, Korea) was used.49 To measure the indentation force, an indentation tip of 5 mm-diameter
sphere was attached to the load cell. The maximum indentation depth
was 100 μm, which was small enough to neglect the effect of
the substrate in indentation compared to the average thickness of
the collagen matrix (approximately 1 mm). The indentation speed was
2.5 μm/s. The effective elastic modulus of the sample was estimated
by fitting a force–deformation (F–D) curve obtained in the indentation experiment to the Hertz
contact model.50

Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) Topographical Imaging
Collagen specimens for AFM imaging
were prepared as described previously.37 Briefly, 30 μL of the collagen matrix with a concentration
of 0.1 mg/mL was deposited onto a coverslip and gently rinsed with
deionized water. Topographical images of normal and modified collagen
were obtained in the intermittent contact mode of AFM at a linear
scan rate in the range of 0.3–0.5 Hz using an MFP-3D AFM (Asylum
Research, USA). A Super sharp AFM probe (Nanosensors, Switzerland)
with a tip radius of ∼2 nm was used for high-resolution imaging
of collagen fibrils or bundles. All AFM measurements were conducted
under ambient conditions. Using the AFM amplitude images, the D-bandings
of the collagen fibrils were determined given that the amplitude signal
was sensitive to changes in the height topography.36,51

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy
The material
composition of the collagen matrix was analyzed using an FT-IR spectrometer
(Bruker, Germany) in the attenuated total reflectance mode. The spectrum
range was 400–4000 cm–1.

Cell Seeding
on Collagen Matrix
Human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Welgene, Korea)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, USA) and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen, USA). The cells were maintained
at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. A total
of 20,000 cells were placed on top of the collagen matrix in a dish.
After 1 h of incubation for allowing the cells to attach, 2 mL of
culture media was added to the dish.

Immunofluorescence Staining
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.5%
Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). For actin and nucleus staining,
the cells were incubated with Alexa-488-labeled phalloidin (Invitrogen,
USA) and Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in PBS with 1% bovine
serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). All images were obtained using
an upright microscope (Nikon, Japan) with Plan Fluor 20× (NA
0.5) and S Plan Fluor 40× (NA 0.6) objectives. Quantification
analysis was performed to measure the cell area, perimeter, and aspect
ratio using the open source software Cell Profiler.52 For a live–dead viability test, an ethidium homodimer
in combination with Calcein-AM (Invitrogen, USA) was used.

After 48 h of incubation after seeding, cells were
imaged using a live-cell imaging chamber (LCI Live Cell Instrument,
Korea) mounted on an inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan). Images were
captured every 10 min for 3 h and 30 min. Three independent experiments
were performed, and >10 cells were tracked in each experiment.
The cell positions were determined manually and recorded using the
ImageJ Manual Tracking plugin. Cell trajectories were plotted using
a custom-written MATLAB code. The migration speed of the cells was
defined as the average value of speeds measured at time intervals
(τ) of 10 min. The turning angle (θ) was defined as the
angle between two cell positions at a given time lag (Δt) (Figure 5a and h).

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented
as the mean ± standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean and were statistically analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 7.0
software. The statistical significance of the difference between data
was assessed using two-tailed t tests.
