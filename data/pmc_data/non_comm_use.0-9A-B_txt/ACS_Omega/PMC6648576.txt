Molecular probes
for picric acid (PA) in both solution and solid
states are important owing to their wide usage in industry. This paper
deals with the design and development of a glucosyl conjugate of pyrene
(L1) along with control molecular
systems, possessing anthracenyl (L2), naphtyl (L3), and phenyl
(L4) moieties, via Knoevenagel
condensation of 2,4-pentanedione with d-glucose. The selectivity
of L1 toward PA has been demonstrated
on the basis of fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy, and the
species of recognition by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
The role of the aromatic group in the selective receptor property
has been addressed among L1, L2, L3, and L4. The structural
features of the {L1 + PA} complex
were established by density functional theory computations. L1 was demonstrated to detect PA in
solid state selectively over other nitroaromatic compounds (NACs).
To study the utility of L1 in
film, cellulose paper strips coated with L1 were used and demonstrated the selective detection
of PA. The observed microstructural features of L1 and its complex {L1 + PA} differ distinctly in both atomic force microscopy and
scanning electron microscopy, all in the support of the complex formation.
Thus, L1 was demonstrated as
a sensitive, selective, and inexpensive probe for PA over several
NACs by visual, spectral, and microscopy methods.

==== Body
Introduction
Excessive use of nitroaromatic
compounds (NACs) in industries causes
serious environmental concern, and hence is a sensitive global issue.1−4 This imposes the necessity of rapid detection of hazardous compounds,
while their explosive character brings in the security issue.5−7 Among NACs, picric acid (PA) is a powerful explosive and a strong
organic acid,8 as well as a main ingredient
that is being used in the industrial preparation of explosives, pharmaceuticals,
and dyes.9 Its contact causes skin and
eye irritation and will also lead to chronic diseases and cyanosis.10−12 Due to these concerns, researchers were involved in the design and
development of small molecular probes suitable for the detection of
PA in both solution and solid states.13−16 Among these, low-molecular-weight
fluorescent probes attracted the attention of scientists in the last
decade owing to their higher sensitivity, selectivity, and real-time
detectability.17−21 In this regard, the literature deals with the use of small to supramolecules,22−24 metal-organic frameworks,25−28 and nanoparticles29−32 as probes for the detection of
PA. The topic of luminescence-based sensing of explosives has been
reviewed recently.33 Several of the literature-known
molecular probes for PA suffer from disadvantages such as interference
from other NACs, poor aqueous solubility, and a high detection range.34−37 All of these aspects limit the practical utility of such probes
for the detection of PA contamination in natural sources, including
water and industrial effluents. All of this demands the development
of a low-molecular-weight-based probe for PA with high water solubility
and low detection range, which is still a challenging task.

Therefore, we have designed a molecule based on carbohydrate for
its water solubility and tunable fluorescent aromatic moiety for imparting
sensitivity and a linker to connect these two via a Knoevenagel condensation
of 2,4-pentanedione with d-glucose.38−41 To our knowledge, such glycoconjugate
has never been reported in the literature as probe for PA. The present
molecular system is an aromatic glycoconjugate that is being demonstrated
for picric acid sensing effectively in solution, in the solid state,
and on cellulose paper. All of this leads to the design of a glucosyl
conjugate of pyrene (L1) owing
to its (i) water solubility, (ii) electron-transfer ability, (iii)
ability to exhibit π···π as well as H-bond
interactions, and (iv) ability to emit in the visible region. The
design for such a molecular probe (L1) is given in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Components Associated with the Design of L1
The interaction between L1 and PA was studied in solution by emission, and absorption
spectroscopy,
the binding by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the complex
formation by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and
the structural features of the complex by density functional theory
(DFT) computations and thus shown to be selective for PA over 11 other
NACs. The role of aromatic moiety in the molecular probe property
has been explored by synthesizing molecules (L2, L3, and L4) with different aromatic groups
and studying all of those in comparison. Even the solid-state detection
of PA by L1 was demonstrated
by fluorescence microscopy. The real-time applicability of L1 in detecting the PA was demonstrated on
Whatman cellulose paper strips. Thus, we report L1 as an optimized aromatic glycoconjugate as probe
for PA in solution, solid, and on cellulose paper.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
The probe molecule L1 has been synthesized in two steps,
as shown in Scheme 2, starting from d-glucose by going through a precursor, P1, that is prepared by the Knoevenagel
condensation of 2,4-pentanedione with d-glucose.42 To determine the role and importance of the
aromatic moiety present in L1 particularly in extending the π···π interactions,
other control molecular derivatives, viz., L2, L3, and L4, possessing anthracenyl, naphthyl,
and phenyl moieties, respectively, were synthesized. All of the precursors
and the final products were characterized by different techniques
such as 1H and 13C NMR and ESI-MS (SI 01–04 and Figures S1–S4 in the Supporting Information). The three-dimensional
structure of the anthracenyl derivative, viz., L2, was established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(XRD).

Single-Crystal X-ray Structure of L 2
Single crystals of good diffraction
quality were obtained
only in the case of L2 from slow
evaporation of its solution of H2O/CH3OH taken
in 1:1 vol/vol ratio, although crystallization was attempted in the
case of all of the derivatives. The L2 crystallizes in monoclinic system with P21 space group, and the crystal structure was solved using the
diffraction data and was refined according to the parametric details
given in this paper,43 and the metric data
are given in the SI 05 as Tables S1–S3, Supporting Information. The single-crystal
XRD structure of L2 shows chair
conformation for the glucose unit with β-anomeric form, wherein
the anomeric form was already shown by the 1H NMR spectra
obtained in solution. Thus, the anomeric form present in the solution
is retained even in the solid state. The centroid-to-centroid distance
of anthracene units observed between the two neighbor molecules is
5.44 Å, suggesting that no π···π interaction
is expected to be present between the molecules in the lattice although
the aromatic portions are stacked one over the other. The intermolecular
distance between the C–H and the anthracenyl moiety in the
lattice is 2.77 Å, supporting C–H···π
interaction (Figure 1b). The lattice structure clearly shows four strong O–H···O
intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the neighbor L2 molecules (Table S1). Although the lattice structure is devoid of π···π
interactions, the molecules present in the lattice are stabilized
by C–H··· π as well as O–H···O
type of interactions (Figure 1c).

diagram showing the stacking of L2.

Solvent Polarity-Dependent
Aggregation of Probe Molecules
To demonstrate the solvent
effect on the aggregation of L1, absorption and fluorescence spectral titrations
were carried out in different solvents varying in their polarity (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The L1 exhibited an emission band, whose
wavelength shifts to red with increase in the polarity on going from
ethanol to water due to the aggregation-induced emission. This is
further observed by the naked eye under UV light of wavelength 365
nm (inset of Figure S6b in the Supporting
Information). However, in the presence of polar aprotic solvents,
such as tetrahydrofuran and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the hydrogen-bonded
structures break to result in monomeric species, leading to blue shift
in the emission spectra (Figure S6a,b).
Corresponding changes were observed even in the absorption spectra
given in Figure S6e,f. It is known from
the literature that the molecules possessing larger aromatic moieties,
such as pyrene, undergo self-assembly in solution through π···π
interaction.44,45L1 exhibited an emission band in the range of 545–575
nm, whose intensity increases with an increase in the concentration
from 2.5 to 100 μM (Figure S6c in
the Supporting Information). All of this clearly supports the formation
of aggregates (580 nm) at higher concentrations, while it is not aggregated
(380 and 397 nm) at lower concentration of L1.

Interaction and Binding of L1 with NACs
by Emission, Absorption, and ITC Titrations
Upon titrating L1 with PA, the emission intensity
is gradually quenched to a maximum extent (∼96%) due to the
electron transfer between L1 and
PA, which results in the formation of nonfluorescent complex (Figure 2b,c). All of the
other NACs studied (Figure 2a) did not show any appreciable change in the fluorescence
intensity of L1, which leads
to a selective detection of PA among all of the 11 NACs studied (Figures 2d and S7). The fluorescence study provided a lowest
detection limit of 12 ± 1 ppb or (0.5 ± 0.1) × 10–7 M for PA (Figure S8 in
the Supporting Information). The probe L1 showed a much lower detection limit compared to other recently
developed fluorescent probes in the literature for picric acid in
aqueous medium (SI 09 in the Supporting Information).

fit, obtained upon using the one-site model. Fluorescence spectra

μM) in water. The inset in each of these corresponds to the
plot of intensity vs mole ratio.

The Stern–Volmer quenching constant (KSV) derived for L1 with
PA is (6.4 ± 0.4) × 105 M–1 and the nonlinear plot indicates the presence of energy transfer
when larger equivalents of PA are added (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). The fluorescence quenching
that occurred in the presence of PA can be identified by the naked
eye due to color change when the vials containing solutions of {L1 + NAC} were kept under a 365 nm
UV lamp (inset of Figure 2d). The competitive fluorescence titration studies indicate
that L1 can recognize PA even
in the presence of excess amount of other nitroaromatic derivatives,
and none of these NACs interfere in the detection efficiency of L1 toward PA.

The absorption
spectrum of L1 exhibit strong
bands at 346 and 276 nm (Figure 2e). Among all of the 11 NACs studied, only
PA exhibited considerable absorption spectral changes in L1 and no other NAC showed any significant
change. As can be seen from Figure 2e, upon addition of increasing equivalents of PA, the
spectra showed increase in the absorbance of both the 346 and 275
nm bands. In the presence of other NACs, the absorption spectra exhibited
only marginal (or no) change supporting that the interaction of other
NACs with L1 is rather weak (Figures 2f and S11 in the Supporting Information). Job plot
yielded 1:1 stoichiometry between L1 and PA in the complex (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information), and the complex formed was further
supported by ESI-MS, where the molecular ion peak was observed at m/z = 662.68 {[L1 + PA] + H+} (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). To understand the thermodynamic
aspects of the interaction of PA with L1, ITC titration was performed and the corresponding thermogram
is shown in Figure 2g. The interaction of PA with L1 is exothermic with large change in the heat of enthalpy (ΔH = −390 kcal). The greater ΔH observed for this goes well with a stronger interaction between L1 and PA, which was supported by
absorption and emission studies. The negative ΔS further supports the formation of a complex between PA and L1. All of this reflected in a greater
sensitivity of interaction of PA with L1.

Size of the Aromatic Moiety vs Detection Sensitivity of PA among
L1, L2,L3, and L4
To understand the importance of the
size of the aromatic moiety in sensing PA, other molecules containing
anthracenyl (L2), naphthyl (L3), and phenyl (L4) having lower aromatic surface area were used
for the study (Figure 2h–j). The control molecules, viz., L2, L3, and L4, exhibited their emissions at considerably
lower wavelengths, viz., ∼450, ∼400, and ∼350
nm, respectively, while L1 shows
emission at 560 nm. The fluorescence emission of L2, L3, and L4 was quenched by PA. However, the
number of equivalents of PA required to bring the same level of quenching
follows a trend L4 > L3 > L2 > L1, suggesting that
the sensitivity
to PA is greater with the probe molecule compared to the control ones.
This is further reflected in their minimum detectable concentration,
viz., 12 ± 1, 45 ± 4, 85 ± 6, and 122 ± 9 ppb
for L1, L2, L3, and L4, respectively (Scheme 2). Thus, the sensitivity of L1 toward PA is at least 3.5 times
greater than that of L2, 7 times
than that of L3, and 10 times
than that of L4, supporting that
the size of the aromatic moiety plays a positive role in contributing
to greater sensitivity when the surface area of the moiety is larger;
hence, L1 possessing pyrene moiety
is a sensitive probe for PA. The sensitivity of L1 is much below the tolerable levels of the nitroaromatics
in drinking water (i.e., 0.1 mg/m3) as reported by EPA.1

Solid-State Detection of PA by L1
The molecular probe L1 was
shown to sense PA in water via fluorescence quenching. To demonstrate
the utility of L1 in detecting
PA in the solid state, the corresponding solid systems were viewed
under UV light that clearly differentiates L1 from {L1 + PA}
and even simple PA, as can be noted from Figure 3a,b. This cannot be differentiated under
visible light. Since the visual appearance under UV light gave positive
result, a detailed fluorescence microscopy study was carried out for
demonstrating the advantage of solid-state detection of PA by L1. While the control solid L1 alone showed green and red fluorescence,
both these components of fluorescence was quenched when PA is mixed
in the solid and the extent to which the quenching take place is dependent
on the mole ratio of the PA added to L1 (Figure 3c–w).
The component of red fluorescence is completely quenched when the
mole ratio is 1:20. However, the component of green emission diminishes
as a function of the ratio of PA added and a 20% intensity of green
emission was still remaining even at 1:50. The fluorescence intensities
were quantitatively measured for both the green and red emission components,
and the corresponding plots (Figure 3x–z2) clearly show that both these
emissions were quenched, and among these, the red emission was quenched
to a greater extent compared to the green emission. As a negative
control, when 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) was used in place of PA, no significant
fluorescence quenching was observed in the corresponding microscopy
images, supporting that even in the solid state, the PA selectively
reacts with L1. Thus, the solid-state
sensing of PA by L1 provides
an advantage to monitor both the fluorescence components independently.
All of these results suggest that PA is responsible for quenching
the fluorescence intensity of L1 in the solid state and hence the probe is suitable for detection
of PA even in the solid state. Both the components showed a linear
relation between the fluorescence intensity and [PA/L1] mole ratio in the range of 1–6.

Detection of PA by L1 on Whatman Cellulose
Paper Strip
To use the molecular probe L1 for the detection of PA in different samples
routinely, an inexpensive, rapid, and use-and-throw method is required;
one such method is developed by coating the Whatman No. 1 cellulose
filter paper strips with L1 (10
μM). Increasing concentrations of PA were added to the strips
coated with L1, resulting in
[PA]/[L1] mole ratios of 0–10
(Figure 4), and this
exhibited gradual quenching up to a maximum of ∼90% (Figure 4a,b). The fluorescence
intensity ratio plot is linear in 2–30 μM PA, and the
minimum detection of PA by L1 is 6 ± 0.4 μM on a Whatman cellulose paper strip. Among
all of the NACs studied, only PA exhibited significant fluorescence
color change in L1 on the cellulose
paper strip under UV light and no other NACs showed any change in
the fluorescence color under the same conditions (Figure 4c). This leads to a selective
detection of PA among all of the NACs studied even on Whatman cellulose
paper strip.

NAC-Induced Supramolecular
Features of L1 in Thin Film by Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM)
Since L1 selectively detects PA and not other NACs in the solid state, it
is interesting to compare the species formed by {L1 + PA} from the rest of the NACs. As both the L1 and NACs possess aromatic moieties, the
aggregation of these is expected to reflect in their morphological
features and the same is supported by AFM and SEM. When L1 is treated with PA, the smaller aggregates
of L1 (Figure 5a) are transformed into larger ones with
size of 200–300 nm in AFM (Figure 5c). However, the same in the presence of
other nitroaromatic compounds, e.g., {L1 + 4-NP}, did not show any aggregated-like structures (Figure S14 in the Supporting Information). The
SEM study (Figure 5d–f) reveals that L1 exhibits
spherical vesicular-like structures. However, upon interaction with
PA, the spherical particles are joined together to form clustered
aggregate-like structures. which were also noted in AFM and is attributable
to the complex formed between L1 and PA. However, AFM and SEM studies carried out with PA alone as
control exhibited features (Figure 5b,e) which are uniformly distributed with a dimension
of 40–60 nm. Thus, the microstructural features observed in
AFM and SEM arise from a similar origin, and the features observed
for L1 and its complex with PA
differ distinctly, supporting that the complex formed between these
is reflected in their microstructures.

(c, f) {L1 + PA}. All of the
three AFM images are for 5 μm
total length in x axis. In each case of scanning
electron microscopy, the line corresponds to 1 μm.

Computational Modeling of the Complex of
PA and L1
To establish the energetics
and the structural
features of the complex formed between L1 and the nitroaromatic compound (NAC), density functional theory
(DFT) calculations were performed for PA, 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB),
2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), and 4-NP using Gaussian 09.47 The initial structure for L1 was prepared by taking the crystallographic
coordinates of L2, followed by
replacing the anthracenyl unit by the pyrenyl one and optimizing the
resultant structure. The optimization was carried out starting from
semiempirical → PM6 → DFT in a cascade fashion. The
structure thus optimized for L1 was used for building the complex with the corresponding preoptimized
NAC. Even the {L1···NAC}
complex was optimized in the cascade fashion starting from semiempirical
and finally taking it to the DFT level. Each of the complex, viz.,
{L1···NAC}, was
optimized at the M06-2X level of theory using 6-31+G(d,p) basis set,
and the resultant structures are shown in Figure 6a–d. In all of the four complexes
studied by the computation, the carbohydrate moiety extends H-bond
interactions with the NAC, and this is further manifested to have
π···π interaction between the aromatic
moiety of NAC and that of the pyrene moiety of L1. The fluorescence quenching is by π···π
overlap between the NAC and the receptor molecule. Thus, the H-bonding
mainly contributes to additional stabilization for the complex formed
between the probe and the NAC and not the fluorescence quenching.
Thus, the complexes are doubly stabilized while the H-bonding stabilization
energy varies from one complex to the other. The centroid-to-centroid
distances between the pyrene and the aromatic moiety of NAC are farther
by 3.21, 3.41, 3.25, and 3.32 Å in the {L1···NAC} complexes of PA, 1,3-DNB, 2,4-DNT,
and 4-NP, respectively. The H-bond stabilization energy for {L1 + PA} is much larger compared to
the other three {L1 + 1,3-DNB/2,4-DNT/4-NP}
complexes owing to the presence of two H-bonds in the first case,
while it is only one in the case of the others (Table S4). The complexation energies of {L1···NAC} were computed using the
formula ΔE = [Ecomp – (EL1 + ENAC)], and the corresponding interaction energies are
given in Table S5 and the coordinates in Tables S6–S14. Based on the complexation
energies obtained, it is evident that the {L1···PA} complex exhibits greater interaction
energy and the complexation energies (in kcal/mol) follow a trend,
viz., [L1 + PA] (−24.20)
> [L1 + DNT] (−22.11)
> [L1 + DNB] (−19.02)
> [L1 + 4-NP] (−17.35),
and the difference among these arises from the H-bonding interactions
present between the glycomoiety and the NAC. Thus, among all of the
NACs, the PA binds strongly to the probe L1.

4-NP at the
M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) level.

The fluorescence was quenched when NAC is added to L1, and this is attributed to the
electron
transfer from the donor L1 to
the acceptor NAC. However, the extent to which such electron transfer
occurs is dependent on the positioning of its lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) with respect to the donor, and the same is given for
[L1···PA] complex
in Figure S15 in the Supporting Information.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO data support
that the electron transfer is maximum in the case of PA and, as a
result, it exhibits maximum fluorescence quenching. The LUMO of the
[L1 + PA] complex has contribution
mainly from PA with significant reduction of its energy compared to L1. The energy of the HOMO, which
is mainly located on the pyrene moiety of L1, does not change much. The energy difference between
the HOMO and LUMO is considerably reduced upon forming a complex with
PA.

Conclusions and Comparisons
A water-soluble fluorescent
probe (L1) for sensing PA has
been designed and synthesized by integrating
the pyrene group into the glucopyranosyl moiety via Knoevenagel condensation.
Among the three control conjugates synthesized using anthracenyl (L2), naphthyl (L3), and phenyl (L4), the structure of L2 was established by single-crystal XRD. The conjugate L1 is a selective probe for PA by switch off
fluorescence to an extent of ∼96% among 11 other NACs studied
in solution. The L1 exhibited
a minimum detection limit of 12 ± 1 ppb {(0.5 ± 0.1) ×
10–7 M} for PA in water. Even in the solid state,
the PA is selectively sensed by L1 with a fluorescence quench of ∼95% and exhibited a minimum
detection limit of 4.5 ± 1.0 μM. Even as a thin film on
Whatman cellulose filter paper, L1 provides a selective detection for PA with a fluorescence quench
of ∼90% and a minimum detection limit of 145 ± 1 ppb (6
± 1 μM). Thus, L1 is
a rare molecule among the probes that are sensitive to PA in the solution,
in the solid state, and on the cellulose paper, although the sensitivity
is about an order of magnitude greater in solution. Thus, L1 is a molecular probe sensitive to micromolar
levels in the solid state and on cellulose paper, and is sensitive
to submicromolar levels in aqueous solution. This is well within the
range to detect the permissible levels of nitroaromatics in drinking
water. Thus, the demonstration of selective detection of PA by L1 in solution, solid state, and a
thin layer on Whatman cellulose paper provides a real-time application
of this probe molecule to detect an industrially important NAC, i.e.,
PA.

The only other probe having pyrene moiety that is reported
in the
literature in sensing the picric acid has been the one that is attached
to choline moiety to bring water solubility.48 Although this pyrene-derivatized choline sensor shows the lowest
detection limit of 23.2 nM for picric acid in solution, the current
probe is twice as sensitive on cellulose paper. On the other hand,
the present receptor has been additionally shown to sense picric acid
in the solid state as well on the cellulose paper. As reported in
this paper, this work addresses the changes occurred in the supramolecular
aggregation in the presence of picric acid by microscopy and also
highlights the aspects associated with the size of the aromatic moiety
in L1–L4 on
its sensitivity toward picric acid. All of these studies are unique
to the present work.

The binding of PA by L1 was
further supported by exhibiting isosbestic point at 325 nm and a 35
nm bathochromic shift in the 360 nm band. The binding of PA to L1 was further demonstrated based
on ITC, where the binding is exothermic and the negative ΔS value is indicative of the complex formation between PA
and L1 and was confirmed by ESI-MS.
The DFT computational studies reveal that the interaction of L1 with PA is through both the π···π
and H-bond types. Even the color change under UV light is detectable
in solution, in the solid state, and in the thin layer on cellulose
paper. Several features pertinent to the sensing of PA by L1 in solution, solid, and in thin layer on
cellulose paper are given in Scheme 3 for a comprehensive view and for comparison. The importance
of L1 in the selective detection
of PA over other conjugates, viz., L2, L3, and L4, has been proven by the fluorescence study.
The size of the aromatic moiety of the conjugates decrease from L1 to L4, and the sensitivity of the detection of PA follows a similar
trend, viz., pyrenyl (L1) >
anthracenyl
(L2) > naphthyl (L3) > and phenyl (L4), to that reflected in their minimum detection limits.
Thus, a strong fluorescent probe (L1) which is the Knoevenagel condensation product of 2,4-pentanedione
with d-glucose reported in this paper, is a highly promising
molecular probe for real-time optical applications mainly because
of its specific and selective interaction with PA in solution, in
the solid state, and on the cellulose paper.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on Bruker
NMR spectrometers working
at 400 and 500 MHz. All of the 13C NMR spectra reported
in this paper are proton-decoupled ones as 13C{1H} spectra. The mass spectra were recorded on maXis impact (Bruker)
using electrospray ionization method. Steady-state fluorescence spectra
were measured on PerkinElmer LS55, and steady-state absorption spectra
were measured on Varian Cary 100 Bio. All of the NACs, given in Figure 2a, viz., picric acid
(PA), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB), 2,4-dinitrotoluene
(2,4-DNT), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 3-nitrophenol, 3-nitrotoluene, nitrobenzene
(NB), 4-nitrobenzoic acid, benzoic acid, and methyl benzene or toluene,
were procured from either Sigma-Aldrich or local sources.

Synthesis and
Characterization of L1
L1 was obtained by
the aldol condensation of β-d-glucopyranosyl-propane-2-one
(P1) with 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde.
To a solution of β-d-glycosidic ketone (P1) (220 mg, 1 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (5 mL), pyrrolidine (30% mol) and 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde
(250 mg, 1.2 mmol) were added. After stirring at room temperature
for 3 h, the reaction mixture was evaporated under the reduced pressure
and the resultant solid was purified by column chromatography with
methanol and dichloromethane (1:9 vol/vol), which afforded the desired
product as a yellow solid (0.286 g, 66% yield). Melting point 195–198

in place of 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde to obtain the product and resultant
that was purified by column chromatography with methanol and dichloromethane

UV–Vis
Absorption and Fluorescence Studies
The
fluorescence titration studies were performed in water using 50 μL
of bulk solution of L1 prepared
at 6 × 10–4 M using 12 different NACs in a
1 cm quartz cell by maintaining a total volume of 3 mL in each measurement
using requisite volume of water. All of this results in a final [L1] of 10 μM in the cuvette,
and requisite volumes of NACs were added to L1 to get the mole ratio of [NAC]/[L1] in 0–10 range. The fluorescence spectra
were recorded in the wavelength range of 355–700 nm by using
λex = 345 nm. The same solutions were used for absorption
titration studies.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
The calorimetric titration
was performed at 25 °C with a MicroCal ITC200 isothermal titration
calorimeter (MicroCal) using the solutions that were predegassed for
30 min using N2. The titration was carried out by adding
2 μL of 0.5 mM solution of PA at each time to 200 μL of
0.05 mM L1 taken in the ITC cell,
and the addition was continued for 20 successive injections by maintaining
200 s time gap between each addition. The ITC data were fitted with
the origin software package provided with the instrument by using
the curve fitting model for one set of sites. Three independent titrations
were carried out to check the consistency of the data. Each time,
a control experiment is being carried out without L1 and the corresponding data were subtracted from
the main titration data and the resultant one was subjected to the
curve fitting.

Solid-State Fluorescence Microscopy Measurements
Solid
samples were prepared by taking 1 mg of L1 and then grinding it along with 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 25 mg
of PA to have different mole ratios, such as 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:10,
1:20, and 1:50, of L1/PA. All
of the samples including the control one, i.e., pure L1 (without the addition of any PA), were
studied on a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S) using green
and red filters. The fluorescence intensities were measured by using
the NIS-Elements BR analysis software, which was provided along with
the microscope.

Preparation of Samples on Whatman Cellulose
Paper Strips
Whatman cellulose paper was cut into small units
of 3 × 1 cm2. The solution of the probe compound (10
μL) was drop-cast
on the central portion of these paper strips, and the solvent was
dried by leaving these at room temperature. The L1-coated strips were used for fluorescence measurements
upon addition of requisite volume of NAC solution. The spots were
examined under 365 nm UV illumination. In the case of PA, the fluorescence
intensity of the strips was measured. To get error bars in the intensity,
the experiment was repeated three times.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) Studies
The SEM
samples of L1 and [L1 + PA] were prepared using 6 × 10–4 M L1. An additional
control was carried out with simple PA. The solutions were sonicated
for 10 min, after which 20–30 μL of aliquot was taken
and spread over an aluminum sheet by the drop-casting method. The
samples were then dried under an IR lamp and analyzed by field emission
gun SEM.
