Here, we have demonstrated visible light-emitting diode
light-driven
selective and efficient aerobic oxidation of primary/secondary alcohols
to aldehydes/ketones and oxidative azo-coupling of anilines using
biomass rice husk-derived chemically activated carbon sheet-supported
copper–iron bimetallic hybrid nanomaterials (CuxFe1–x@RCAC) under
oxidant and additive-free conditions. The catalytic activity of the
CuxFe1–x@RCAC materials has been investigated for the oxidation of alcohols
and anilines, and Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC was established
as the best catalyst. Moreover, a tandem one-pot protocol has been
developed for the sequential oxidation of alcohols followed by condensation
to functionalized imidazole and imine derivatives in high isolated
yields. The hybrid materials were highly robust and stable under the
reaction conditions and were recovered simply by filtration and recycled
up to 12th run without considerable loss in catalytic activity.

1 Introduction
Recently, visible light-driven
chemical transformations have emerged
as one of the green pathways in organic synthesis.1 A photosensitizer and an active catalyst are essential
for the generation of active electrons/holes and the chemical transformation
of reactant molecules to desired products.2 Delightfully, oxidations under the photochemical condition are considered
as one of the sustainable approaches, where active oxygen species
can be generated from the oxidant by the irradiation of light under
mild and environmental benign reaction conditions.3,4 Further,
aerobic oxidations are economic with added advantages of avoiding
transport and handling of the flammable oxygen cylinder as well as
avoiding use of toxic reagents.5 Among
other oxidation reactions, oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds
has emerged as the fascinating area of research in the synthetic organic
chemistry because of enormous applications of products in pharmaceutical/agro-chemical/fragrances/food/electronic-industries.6−11 Over the period, various hybrid photocatalysts, for example, Pt–metal
oxide12/Pt–MOF13/Pt–/Rh–/Ir–TiO214/Pt–, Au–, Pd–, Ag–/TiO215/Au/TiO216/Au/TiO2–SBA-1517/Au–WO318/Au–/Cu–CeO219/CsPbBr3–TiO2,20 and FAPBr3–TiO221 have been developed for clean oxidation of benzyl
alcohols to corresponding aromatic aldehydes/ketones. However, the
use of precious and costly heavy metals (e.g., Au, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh,
Pb, and so forth.), low quantum yield, and inefficiency of TiO2 in the visible-light regime are the major limitations which
restrict their practical applications. Hence, it still remains important
and interesting to develop a economic and sustainable photocatalyst
to address these issues.

On the other hand, development of a
sustainable protocol for the
oxidative azo-coupling of anilines is essential as the products, aromatic
azos, displayed diverse applications in chemical, pharmaceutical,22,23 electronics, and optics.24 The literature
study reveals that several Cu-based catalysts in combination with
nitrogen-containing ligands have reported for the synthesis of aromatic
azo compounds via oxidative azo-coupling of anilines.25−33 However, oxidative azo-coupling of anilines under the photochemical
condition have been rarely reported. Moreover, there is a lack of
general, efficient, and sustainable catalyst for the oxidation of
both alcohols and amines. Thus, sustainable development of an efficient
and economic photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of both alcohols
and aromatic amines is highly desirable.

Here, we have speculated
that the problems associated with the
use of precious noble metals, inactivity of TiO2 under
visible light, and use of toxic and expensive oxidants and nitrogen-containing
ligands could be overcome by developing a visible light-driven sustainable
and general protocol for oxidation reactions using first row transition
metal–carbonaceous hybrid material as the catalyst and air
as the source of oxygen.

Iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) are abundant,
eco-friendly, first-row
transition metals in earth’s crust and constitute an integral
part in biological systems and play a vital role in molecular oxygen
activation and transportation at ambient temperature.34,35 Motivated by the nature’s action, different Fe- and Cu-based
catalysts were developed for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols.36 However, to the best of our knowledge, Fe–Cu-catalyzed
photo-oxidation of alcohols and anilines has not been reported, although
Fe-based catalysts were reported to be active in photocatalytic water
splitting and dye degradation reactions.37 Similarly, Cu-based materials were also established as excellent
candidate for harvesting visible light.38 Thus, precious noble metals could be replaced by Fe–Cu for
the generation of active oxygen species for the oxidation of alcohols
which will be beneficial from an industrial and environmental point
of view.

On the other hand, over decades, hybrid carbonaceous
materials
such as graphene oxide (GO)/N-doped graphene,39 graphene/C3N4,40 AgBr@TiO2/GO,41u–Pt/C,42 Au–CNT,43 and
metal-doped g-C3N444−47 have been established as fascinating
excellent visible light-driven photocatalysts for oxidation of alcohols.
Interestingly, instead of using commercially available carbonaceous
materials, biomass feedstock-derived chemically activated carbonaceous
(CAC) materials are attractive. The transformation of biomass to customize
carbon is essential as the process results in decrease of the so-called
“carbon-footprint” and cost-to-value relationships.
In addition to these, biomass feedstock-derived CAC provides several
advantages of easy availability at free of cost or at low cost, presence
of excellent porosity and electrical conductivity, eco-friendly, and
finally and most importantly, the presence of high oxygen-rich surface
functional groups which can hold active catalysts securely. Consequently,
Zhao and Zhao48 have prepared graphene
sheets from disposable paper cups for fuel cell applications. Ruan
and his group49 have fabricated graphene
from cookies, chocolate, grass, plastics, roaches, and dog feces on
Cu foil at 1050 °C under H2/Ar flow. Veerakumar and
co-workers50 have reported beetroot-derived
activated porous carbon-supported Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(NPs) for reduction of nitro-aromatics to amines. Sudhan et al.51 have developed activated porous carbon from
rice straw for a high-energy symmetric super capacitor.

Further,
it has been well established that bimetallic NPs showed
superior activity compared to monometallic ones. This is due to the
synergetic effects, which originates by the change of the electronic
structure because of charge transfer or structural strain between
metals, interfacial collaboration by two metals, and interfacial stabilization.19,52 For example, Au–Pd53−55 and Cu–Ag56 bimetallic catalysts have outperformed the monometallic
ones for the oxidation of benzyl alcohols. However, to the best of
our knowledge, the catalytic activity of the Cu–Fe bimetallic
nanocatalyst has not been investigated in the oxidation of alcohols
and oxidative azo-coupling of anilines under visible light irradiation.

As a part of our continuous effort in the development of the synthetic
methodology using heterogeneous green nanocatalysts,57−64 herein, we have developed biomass rice husk (RH)-derived chemically
activated carbon sheet-supported Cu–Fe-nanocomposites (CuxFe1–x@RCAC)
for visible light-driven efficient and selective aerial oxidation
of benzyl alcohols and anilines to carbonyl compounds and azos and
a tandem one-pot oxidation–condensation to functionalized imidazole
and imine derivatives under oxidant-free reaction conditions (Scheme 1).

2 Results and Discussion
Initially, biomass
RHs were converted to chemically activated carbon
(RCAC). Briefly, RHs were washed with water and digested with few
drops of concentrated HCl under boiling conditions for 1 h to remove
dust and other impurities, dried under an oven at 80 °C for 24
h. Next, the RHs were carbonized in a muffle furnace at 500 °C
for 3 h to obtain black material (RCBA-500 °C) followed by activation
with KOH. The KOH–carbon mixture was then calcined at 500,
600, and 700 °C for 3 h. The calcined materials were washed thoroughly
with distilled water until the samples became free from alkalis (until
pH = 7) and dried at 80 °C for 15 h. The physiochemical properties
of the carbonaceous materials before activation and after activation
were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
studies.

The Raman spectra of carbonized materials before and
after KOH
activation reveal the presence of peak at ∼1500 cm–1, corresponding to the G band of sp2-bonded carbon in
planar sheets of graphite. Again, a peak at ∼1235 cm–1 which is assigned to the D band of carbon in the Raman spectra of
all materials was observed. The D-band signified the presence of the
defect and oxygen functionality in chemically activated carbon (RCAC)
(Figure 1a).65 The ID/IG ratios were calculated for all the four samples, and
it was observed that the intensity of the D band (ID) is more in KOH-activated samples compared to samples
before activation (Figure 1b). Thus, KOH activation leads to formation of defects and
generation of oxygen functionality. Again, with increasing temperature
of calcination, ID gradually increases
and the RCAC-600 sample was considered for immobilization of NPs as
the sample contains balance of sp2-bonded planar carbon
sheets and defects/oxygen functionalities. The conversion of biomass
RH to amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon via carbonization–activation
processes has also been demonstrated by the powder XRD studies. The
powder XRD spectra
of RCBA-500 (red line) and RCAC-600 (black line) reveal the existence
of two broad peaks at 2θ ≈ 25 and 44° (Figure 1c), corresponding
to the reflection plane of {002}, because of stacking of the layers,
and the reflection plane of {100}, which is attributed to stacking
of the layers. These data are in good accordance with those of reported
data.38,39 The broadening of peaks in powder XRD indicates
the formation of disordered amorphous carbon.

(b) ID/IG ratio
of carbon before (RCBA-600) and after
activation at different temperature; (c) powder XRD of RH-derived
carbon before (RCBA-600) and after activation (RCAC-600).

Next, different amounts of Fe–Cu NPs were
immobilized on
the surface RCAC-600 to prepare hybrid nanomaterials. Briefly, an
appropriate amount of FeCl2 and CuCl2 were dissolved
in methanol under sonication followed by the addition of NaBH4 in methanol (3 equiv) under the similar reaction conditions.
The resulting mixture was then sonicated additionally for 2 h. Afterward,
the mixture was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried under
oven at 80 °C for 2 h. A series of materials were prepared by
the above mentioned procedure by adjusting the amount of metal content.
A list of materials along with the composition and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface (SBET) areas has been given in Table 1.

5	sample-V	Cu@RCAC	9.91 wt % Cu@RCAC	 	
6	sample-VI	Fe@RCAC	9.89 wt % Fe@RCAC	 	
The prepared materials were characterized by spectroscopic
and
analytical techniques. The inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES) study has been performed to determine the metal
content in the material and results are given Table 1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface (SBET) area of RCAC was determined
to be 1035 m2/g and the SBET for CuxFe1–x@RCAC materials were found to be close to the surface area
of pure RCAC, indicating that metal loading does not change the surface
areas of the biomass-derived chemically activated carbon significantly.
EDAX study of Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC demonstrated the
presence of C, Cu, Fe, and O element in the sample (Figure 2a). The powder XRD studies
have been performed to confirm the crystalline nature of hybrid materials.
The powder XRD spectra of CuxFe1–x@RCAC are presented in Figure 2b, which reveals the immobilization of Cu–Fe
on the carbon support. Along with two broad diffraction peaks for carbon at 2θ ≈ 26 and
44° corresponding to {002} and {200} planes. The diffraction
peak at 2θ ≈ 43.6, 50.8, and 74.4° corresponds to
{111}, {200}, and {220} reflection planes of Cu(0) NPs and peaks at
2θ = 44.9, 65, and 75.2° represents {110}, {200}, and {222}
reflection plane of Fe(0) NPs.

of CuxFe1–x@RCAC hybrid materials.

The morphology of the pristine RCAC and hybrid
CuxFe1–x@RCAC materials was
analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) studies.
The FESEM images of RCAC reveals that KOH activation generated 2D
carbon sheets which are further self-assembled to form porous channels
with a length of 580 μm and diameter of 4 μm (Figure 3b). Pore formation
by KOH activation has been well demonstrated in the literature.66 However, the presence of such pores was not
observed in the FESEM image of carbon before KOH activation (Figure 3a). Further, FESEM–EDAX
indicates that undoped carbon was free from metal impurities. Most
importantly, the FESEM image of Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC
also reveals the existence of cavities which can serve as the main
channel to connect the inner surface of RCAC through the pores. Thus,
immobilization of Fu and Cu NPs on RCAC did not destroy the porous
morphology of the activated carbon (Figure 3d). The EDAX study of Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC reveals the presence of C, Cu, Fe, and O elements
(Figure 2a).

(b) after KOH activation; (c) FESEM–EDAX of pure carbon after

High-resolution transmission electron microscopic
(HRTEM) study
was performed for both pure and NPs-loaded activated carbon. The HRTEM
image of pure RCAC shows sheetlike structure similar to that observed
in FESEM (Figure 4a)
and TEM images. Figure 4b shows the immobilization of nano-size Fe and Cu on the carbon surface.
The average particle size of 5 nm was also confirmed from the TEM
image (Figure 4b,c).
The well dispersion of NPs on the support was also indicated from
the TEM image (Figure 4c).

Next, the catalytic activity of the CuxFe1–x@RCAC materials
was investigated
in the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohol. Initially, we have
examined the oxidation of benzyl alcohol as a model reaction under
light-emitting diode (LED) light. When a mixture of benzyl alcohol
(0.5 mmol) and pristine RCAC (50 mg) was heated at 120 °C in
toluene (2 mL) with continuous air flow in the presence of LED light
(10 W), a moderate yield of benzaldehyde (30%) was obtained after
12 h (entry 1, Table 2). However, the yield was decreased to 10% when the same reaction
was conducted in the dark (entry 2, Table 2). This indicates the photocatalytic activity
of biomass-derived chemically activated carbon. The formation of the
product was identified by the 1H NMR spectroscopic study.
The reaction is highly selective and produced benzaldehyde as the
only product. No further oxidation to carboxylic acid was observed.
Motivated by this result, subsequently, Cu–Fe NP-loaded RCAC
hybrid materials were investigated for benzyl alcohol oxidation under
LED light. We are delighted to observe a significant increase in the
rate of reaction using Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC (50 mg)
as the catalyst, producing 98% of benzaldehyde within 2 h (entry 3, Table 2).

a Conditions: benzyl alcohol (0.5
mmol), catalyst (50 mg), total metal loading adjusted to 10 wt %,
solvent (2 mL), 10 W LED bulb.

b Air flow using air pump.

c H2O2 (1.5
mmol).

d TBHP (1.5 mmol).

It was observed that with decreasing Cu-content in
CuxFe1–x@RCAC, the
conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde gradually decreased,
and 62 and 32% of benzaldehyde was produced using Cu0.5Fe0.5@RCAC and Cu0.1Fe0.9@RCAC,
respectively (entries 4–5, Table 2). Most importantly, Cu–Fe bimetallic
NP-immobilized RCAC materials showed better activity corresponding
to the individual Cu- or Fe-loaded catalyst (entries 6–7, Table 2). Thus, Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC was established as the best catalyst for oxidation
of benzyl alcohol under LED light. The photocatalytic oxidation was
screened in different solvents and toluene proved to be the best choice
of solvent over H2O, EtOH, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane,
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for the model oxidation reaction (entries
10–14, Table 2). The other oxidant like tert-butyl hydroperoxide
(TBHP) and H2O2 produced an almost similar yield
of benzaldehyde, and thus, air was used as the eco-friendly oxidant.
When the reaction was carried out in dark conditions at 120 °C
in toluene in the absence of light, 52% of benzaldehyde was produced
(entry 15, Table 2).
Thus, Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC is also effective to catalyze
the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the absence of light with relatively
lower conversion. This could be possibly due to higher activation
of molecular oxygen in the presence of light and heat compared to
only heat or only light.

The relative catalytic performance
of CuxFe1–x@RCAC was further demonstrated
by UV–vis studies. To do so, we have performed oxidation of
benzyl alcohol (0.5 mmol) in toluene (2 mL) at 120 °C in the
presence of LED using five different CuxFe1–x@RCAC catalysts and stopped
the reaction after 1 h. After each reaction, the catalyst was separated,
and toluene was evaporated. Next, the crude product was diluted with
a fixed amount of n-hexane to perform the UV–vis
study. The UV–vis spectra presented in Figure 5a indicate that CuxFe1–x@RCAC materials are
better than its individual component and a steady increase in absorbance
of benzaldehyde (λmax = 239 nm) with increasing Cu-content
in bimetallic hybrid materials. The Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC catalyst was found to be best among the five catalyst tested
here. Figure 5b represents
relative conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using CuxFe1–x@RCAC.

studies of comparison of catalytic activity of
CuxFe1–x@RCAC in benzyl alcohol oxidation, (b) relative yield of formation
of benzaldehyde using CuxFe1–x@RCAC materials.

With the optimized reaction conditions in hand,
next, we have explored
the scope of catalytic oxidation of alcohols. The results are presented
in Table 3. A number
of structurally divergent primary and secondary benzyl alcohols were
oxidized by Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC under aerobic conditions
in the presence of visible LED light irradiation, producing excellent
yields (85–98%) of aromatic aldehydes (2a–k, Table 3)/ketones
(2l–r) within 2 h. Various benzyl alcohols containing
electron-donating (e.g., −Me, −OMe, −Br, −Cl,
−OH, etc.) groups(entries 2b–g, Table 3) and electron-withdrawing
(e.g., −NO2) (entries 2h–i, Table 3) groups at ortho-/meta-/
and para-position of the benzene ring were smoothly converted to corresponding
aromatic aldehydes in an excellent yield within 2 h under optimized
reaction conditions. Moreover, the protocol is also demonstrated synthesis
of hetero-aromatic pyridine-3-aldehyde and thiophene-2-aldehyde (entries 2j–k, Table 3). Secondary benzyl alcohols were also efficiently oxidized
by Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC in toluene at 120 °C
under air in the presence of LED light to corresponding aromatic ketones
of industrial importance such as acetophenone derivatives (entries 2l–p, Table 3), propiophenone (entry 2q, Table 3), and benzophenone (entry 2r, Table 3) in good yields (85–90%).

Table 3 Scope of Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Alcoholsa
a Reaction conditions: benzyl alcohol
(0.5 mmol), Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC (50 mg) in 2 mL
of toluene at 120 °C for 2.0 h under air in the presence of LED
light. The yields refer to isolated pure products.

Further, cinnamyl alcohol was selectively converted
to cinnamaldehyde
without formation of any by-products in good yield (2v, 86%).

Afterward, Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC was
employed for
oxidation of benzoin to benzil, an important diketone found several
applications as photosensitizers, ligands, and starting material for
drugs, agro-chemicals, and perfumes. We are delighted to observe 100%
conversion of benzoin to benzil under the optimized reaction conditions
(2s, Table 3). 4,4′-dichloro benzoin and 4,4′-dimethyl benzoin
also oxidized to corresponding benzil derivatives (2t–u, Table 3). All the
reactions listed in Table 3 are very clean and highly selective in nature. No further
oxidation of aldehydes took place. The method is free from using a
toxic and expensive oxidant as the air was used as the sole oxidant.
After the reaction, the catalyst was separated simply by filtration,
washed with ethyl acetate, dried in oven, and reused for subsequent
reactions. The combine organic extract was evaporated to yield the
crude products, which was purified by short column chromatography
over silica gel (mesh size 60–120) using 5% ethyl acetate in
petroleum ether. All the products listed in Table 3 are known from the literature and were identified
by 1H NMR spectroscopy study. The NMR spectra are provided
in the Supporting Information.

Further,
we have extended the scope of this methodology in one-pot
oxidation of benzoin followed by condensation with aromatic aldehyde
and ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) for the synthesis of imidazole
derivatives. Initially, benzoin (1 mmol) and Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC were irradiated with LED under an air flow condition
for 2 h; then, benzaldehyde (1 mmol) and NH4OAc (2.5 mmol)
were added to the reaction mixture and continued to run the reaction
under the same conditions for 1 h (TLC monitored) with appearance
of a solid product. The solid product was dissolved in ethanol (3
mL), and the catalyst was separated by simple filtration with filter
paper washed with few drops of ethanol. Pure 2,4,5-triphenyl imidazole
recrystallized from ethanol solution. The pure product was initially
identified by melting point determination (observed mp 267–269
°C; reported mp 270–274 °C) and further confirmed
by 1H NMR study. The scope of Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC-catalyzed one-pot tandem oxidation–condensation was
explored by using different aromatic aldehydes. The results of tandem
oxidation–condensation reactions are presented in Table 4.

Table 4 Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC-Catalyzed
Tandem Oxidation–Condensation Leading to Imidazolesa
a Reaction conditions: benzoin (0.5
mmol), Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC (50 mg) in 2 mL of toluene
at 120 °C for 2.0 h under air in the presence of LED light followed
by addition of aromatic aldehyde (0.5 mmol) and NH4OAc
(1.0 mmol) under the same conditions. The yields refer to isolated
pure products.

Series of tri-substituted imidazole derivatives (3a–e, Table 4) were synthesized.
All the reactions were very clean and high yielding (92–98%).
The products were purified by recrystallization from ethanol, and
no column chromatography was required.

Further, we have also
demonstrated Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC-catalyzed one-pot
oxidation of benzyl alcohol and sequential
condensation with amines to produce imines using the hybrid nanocatalyst.
Air was passed through benzyl alcohol (1 mmol) in the presence of
50
mg of catalyst under LED light, and benzyl amine (1 mmol) was added
after 2 h, the reaction was continued for additional 1 h under normal
conditions in the absence of LED, and an excellent yield of imines
(4a, 92%) was produced. The results are summarized in Scheme 2.

Finally, we have presented a plausible mechanism
for visible light-promoted
Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC-catalyzed aerial oxidation of
alcohol in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Plausible Mechanism for the Light-Promoted Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol
The catalytic system also was effective for
the oxidation of benzyl
alcohol under LED-free conditions, and an alternative pathway for
the oxidation of benzyl alcohol has been proposed when the reaction
was carried under the heating condition in the absence of LED (see Figures S18 and S25).

Motivated by the
catalytic activity of Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC in selective
and efficient oxidation of primary and secondary
alcohols and tandem oxidation–condensation reaction, next,
we have investigated its catalytic performance in the oxidative azo-coupling
of anilines, leading to synthesis of aromatic azos. When a mixture
of 4-methoxyaniline (1 mmol), Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC
(50 mg) is heated at 120 °C in toluene (2 mL) under continuous
air flow in the presence of LED light irradiation, a good yield of
(E)-1,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)diazene (5c, 88%) was obtained. The yield was increased to 98% when the reaction
was performed in CH3CN at 80 °C under LED light. A
decrease in yield (72%) was observed when the same reaction was performed
in the absence of LED under dark conditions. A comparative UV–vis
study was accomplished to compare the catalytic activity of various
CuxFe1–x@RCAC materials. The results were depicted in Figure 6. The comparative UV–vis studies clearly
indicate that bimetallic nanocomposites have shown better activity
compared to its mono-metallic one, and Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC is the best and Fe@RCAC showed least reactivity among other
all five catalysts tested here.

CuxFe1–x@RCAC in oxidation

yield of formation of azo using CuxFe1–x@RCAC materials after 2 h.

A series of anilines underwent oxidative azo-coupling
in the presence
of Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC under LED light in air to
afford good to excellent yields (85–92%) of products within
6–8 h. We have also observed a cleared electronic effect on
this reaction. The electron-rich mono-substituted aryl amines demonstrated
admirable reactivity with higher isolated yields of azos compared
to aryl amine with electron-withdrawing groups. The results are summarized
in Table 5.

Table 5 Substrate Scope for Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC-Catalyzed Oxidative Azo-Coupling of Anilinesa
a Reaction conditions: aromatic amine
(0.5 mmol), Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC (50 mg) in 2 mL
of CH3CN at 85 °C under air in the presence of LED
light. The yields refer to isolated pure products.

Finally, we have investigated the stability and recyclability
of
the Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC catalyst by considering
the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (2a, Table 2) as a model reaction under
optimized conditions. The catalyst was separated from the reaction
mixture simply by filtration, washed with ethanol (2 × 2 mL),
dried in an oven at 80 °C for 4 h, and reused the catalyst for
successive reactions. The recyclability study reveals that the RCAC
provided sufficient stability to NPs and the catalyst remained stable
and active under the reaction conditions and recycled up to 12 times
without significant loss in yields of the reaction (Figure 7a). Further, heterogeneity
of the oxidation reaction was recognized by performing the leaching
study by the hot filtration test. Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration under
hot conditions just after 15 min which was allied with 15% conversion
and the remaining filtrate was continued to run up to 2 h further
under the standard conditions.

Figure 7 (a) Recyclability of Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC, (b)
leaching study by the hot filtration method, (c) powder XRD spectrum,
and (d) FESEM image of recycled Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC
after 12th run.

However, no significant development of the reaction
was observed
after filtration, which indicates that no leaching of Cu and Fe NPs
had taken place from the chemically activated carbon sheets (see Figure 7b). The fate of the
reused catalyst was analyzed by powder XRD and FESEM studies (Figure 7c,d). The powder
XRD spectrum (Figure 7c) of the recycled catalyst indicates partial oxidation of copper
to cuprous oxide, and substantial loss of the porous channel structure
was also evident from the FESEM image (Figure 7d).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
synthesized CuxFe1–x@RCAC hybrid photoactive
materials by immobilization of different amounts of Cu- and Fe-NPs
on the surface of biomass RH-derived activated porous carbon sheets.
The formation of graphitic carbon sheetlike hybrid materials was identified
by Raman spectroscopy, powder XRD, FESEM, EDAX N2 absorption–desorption,
and HRTEM studies. The photocatalytic activity of hybrid
materials were tested the oxidation of benzyl alcohols as well as
oxidative azo-coupling of aniline to aromatic azos under visible LED
light in air as oxidant. It was observed that bimetallic catalysts
were better compared to its mono metallic counterpart, and Cu0.9Fe0.1@RCAC yielded best results among others.
The present catalytic protocol offered following advantages such as
clean reaction condition as air used as source of oxygen, use of visible
LED light active and reusable catalyst, broad substrate scope, excellent
isolated yields (85–100%) and biomass feedstock was used as
source of carbon. We have also reported a one-pot tandem oxidation
of benzoin followed by condensation with aldehyde and NH4OAc, leading to synthesis of tri-substituted imidazole derivatives
and one-pot oxidation–condensation to imines in excellent yields.
Most importantly, the present research demonstrated biomass management
and utilization in commercially important organic transformation,
and we believe that the hybrid materials will find numerous applications.
