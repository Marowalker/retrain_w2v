Although
artificial superhydrophobic materials have extensive and significant
applications in antifouling, self-cleaning, anti-icing, fluid transport,
oil/water separation, and so forth, the poor robustness of these surfaces
has always been a bottleneck for their development in practical industrial
applications. Here, we report a facile, economical, efficient, and
versatile strategy to prepare environmentally friendly, mechanically
robust, and transparent superhydrophobic surfaces by combining adhesive
and hydrophobic paint, which is applicable for both hard and soft
substrates. The coated substrates exhibit excellent superhydrophobic
property and ultralow adhesion with water (contact angle ≈
160° and sliding angle <2°). Additionally, the coated
surface maintained its superhydrophobicity even after 325 sandpaper
abrasion cycles, showing remarkable mechanical robustness. Furthermore,
the coated surfaces were applied to separate oil/water mixtures because
of their unique characteristics of being simultaneously superhydrophobic
and superoleophilic. In addition, it is believed that this fabrication
method is significant, promising, and feasible for mass production
of superhydrophobic surfaces for industrial applications.

Introduction
Artificial
superhydrophobic materials have been widely designed
and fabricated by getting motivation from the nature such as lotus
leaves,1 butterfly wings,2 legs of the water strider,3 and
so on,4 wherein the extreme water repellency
is resulted from low-surface-energy chemical components and dual-scale
hierarchical surface structures.5,6 These materials have
engaged increasing consideration because of their exciting applications
in self-cleaning,7 antifouling,8 anti-icing,9 drag
reduction in fluid transport,10 and oil/water
separation.11−13 In
addition, if transparent superhydrophobic surfaces could be produced,
the range of their possible applications could be further extended
to glass-based substrates such as windshields for automobile, windows,
goggles, and solar panels.14−17 In the past decades, various
kinds of methods including dip-coating,18 vapor-phase deposition,19 electrospinning,20 self-assembly,21 and
so on22 have been applied to construct
superhydrophobic surfaces such as fluoroalkylsilane (FAS)-grafted
ceramic membrane,23 polytetrafluoroethylene-coated
glass,24 stearic acid-modified steel,25 SiO2-coated sponge,26,27 TiO2-modified fabric,28 and
so forth.29 Unfortunately, many fabricated
superhydrophobic surfaces can be easily damaged by the application
of an external force because of the poor mechanical stability of the
rough surface structure and weak adhesion between low-surface-energy
coating and the substrates, which greatly limits their application
and development.30−32 It
is challenging to realize both robustness and superhydrophobicity
simultaneously by a facile and cost-effective approach.

Number
of conventional strategies are employed to enhance the robustness
of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as creating covalent bond between
superhydrophobic coating and substrate,31 microscale protuberance to protect nanoscale structures,33 adding elastic and soft materials to the coatings,34 fabrication of bulk superhydrophobic materials,35 fabrication of self-healing superhydrophobic
surfaces,36 and so on.37−40 For instance,
Deng et al.31 prepared a mechanically robust
superhydrophobic surface by the chemical vapor deposition method.
As-prepared coating was composed of porous silica capsules where the
particles were chemically bonded with each other and to the substrate
surface through silica bridges that formed by the hydrolysis and condensation
of tetraethoxysilane. The obtained surface maintained its superhydrophobicity
after performing abrasion tests with double-sided tape and sand paper.
Besides, Zhang et al.41 fabricated a TiO2/SiO2/polypropylene composite bulk material with
superhydrophobic property based on the powder pressing approach, which
could retain desirable water repellency even after being mechanically
damaged. Additionally, Lin et al.42 reported
a self-healing superhydrophobic coating which contains hydrophobic
nanoparticles, fluorinated alkyl silane (FAS), and fluorocarbon surfactant.
The coating exhibited self-healing ability against both chemical and
physical damages after being heat treated at 135 °C. However,
the above-mentioned fabrication methods require complex processes
or expensive equipment, which greatly narrows their wide application
in industry.

Recently, Lu et al.43 developed an ethanol-based suspension of dual-scale TiO2 nanoparticles modified with perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane to form
a paint that could be coated onto various substrates to create a superhydrophobic
and superoleophobic surface. They proposed the use of commercial adhesives
to bond the paint and substrates for the first time. After enhancing
the robustness by using adhesives, the painted surface could maintain
its superhydrophobicity even after being scratched by a knife and
also 40 abrasion cycles with sandpaper. Similarly, Chen et al.44 prepared a superhydrophobic surface by spraying
“adhesive + hydrophobic CaCO3 nanoparticles (modified
with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane)”. The as-prepared
surface exhibits good self-cleaning property and shows durability
against sandpaper abrasion and knife scratch. However, above-mentioned
superhydrophobic coatings are not transparent, and the fluorinated
reagents used in the coating are quite expensive and not environmentally
friendly, which limit their practical applications related to glass
or solar energy. Consequently, to prepare environmentally friendly,
mechanically robust, and transparent superhydrophobic surface is highly
desirable.

Inspired by the pioneer research, we present a versatile
strategy to prepare mechanically robust, environmentally friendly,
and transparent superhydrophobic coating applicable for both hard
and soft substrates. In this work, we propose a ferroconcrete structure
that is composed of adhesive particles which act as the skeleton and
functional particles for the filler to further enhance the robustness
of hydrophobic surfaces. Moreover, inexpensive and fluorine-free SiO2 nanoparticles modified with dimethyldichlorosilane (DDS)
was selected as a hydrophobic functional paint. To construct the ferroconcrete
structure, the commercial adhesive particles and an ethanol suspension
of SiO2 nanoparticles were sprayed consecutively and repetitively
onto the substrates. This superhydrophobic surface fabricating strategy
is applicable for both soft and hard substrates such as glass slides,
stainless steel meshes, and sponges. As-prepared superhydrophobic
surfaces display significant likely applications in oil/water separation
and self-cleaning. This versatile method provides a facile, low-cost,
and highly efficient solution for the fabrication of environmentally
friendly superhydrophobic surfaces and possesses promising potential
in large-scale industrial applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
All required materials were of commercial standard and were utilized
without any purification, which could lower the cost of fabrication.
The hydrophobic fumed silica nanoparticles having an average size
of 16 nm (modified with DDS, AEROSIL R972) were purchased from Degussa,
Germany. Spray adhesive 75 was obtained from 3M Co., Ltd. Ethanol
and acetone were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.,
China. Sandpaper (grit no. 800) was purchased from Beijing Dongxin
Grind Instrument Co., Ltd., China. Carbon tetrachloride and decane
were purchased from J&K, China. The glass slides (CAT. no. 7101)
were purchased from Sail Brand. The stainless steel mesh and PU sponge
were bought from the local supermarket. All silicon wafers, glass
slides, stainless meshes, and sponges were ultrasonically cleaned
before utilizing.

Preparation of the
Superhydrophobic Coating
In brief, a paint-like suspension
was formulated by adding 5 g of DDS-modified SiO2 into
95 g of absolute ethanol and magnetically stirred for 1 h. Then, all
of the superhydrophobic surfaces were assembled by the spray-coating
method. The adhesive was first sprayed on the surface of all substrates
for 3 s with a distance of 400 mm. Then, the hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticle suspension was sprayed on the surface of adhesive-modified
substrates for 6 s with a distance of 400 mm. This mechanism was characterized
as one cycle of preparation. The ferroconcrete-structured superhydrophobic
coating on the substrates was fabricated by 1–10 cycles. All
as-prepared substrates were dried in air for 5 min before characterization.

Characterization
The morphologies
of all substrates were examined by a HITACHI SU8220 field emission
scanning electron microscope. The surface composition and chemical
states were identified by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera II), and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, IRTracer-100, SHIMADZU). All of the samples
were sputtered with Pt before scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests.
The transmittance of pristine and as-prepared glass was measured by
a UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600 plus, SHIMADZU).
The water sliding angle and water contact angle (WCA) were evaluated
by OCA 25 (Data-Physics, Germany) at ambient temperature.

Robustness Test
The sandpaper of grit 800
was elected as an abrasive surface to test the durability of the as-prepared
superhydrophobic glass slides. The as-prepared glass slide surface
was placed face down onto the sandpaper. The robustness test is achieved
by performing a reciprocating motion of the glass slides at a velocity
of 10 mm/s with a round trip distance of 20 cm. The above round trip
movement was characterized as one cycle of abrasion. The wettability
of the sample was evaluated by measuring the WCA after every 15 cycles.

Oil/Water Separation
The coated
and uncoated stainless steel meshes were placed between the two glass
tubes, and this assembly was placed on a beaker. The oil/water mixture
was drained gradually into the above glass tube. In order to calculate
the separation efficiency, following relation has been utilized 1  where m0 is the initial mass of water and m1 is
the water mass after separation. For measurement of separation efficiency,
the oil/water mixture that consists of 10 g of water and 10 g of oil
was prepared and used in each separation experiment.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Modified Surfaces: Morphology, Composition,
and Wettability
The mechanically durable superhydrophobic
surface was prepared by following the procedure, as shown in Figure 1. The hydrophobic
SiO2 nanoparticles were used to construct the hierarchical
rough structure with low-surface-energy property on the substrate
surface. Meanwhile, the spray adhesive was used to enhance the strength
of coating and the bonding force between SiO2 nanoparticles
and substrate. The surface morphology and element analysis of adhesive
and modified SiO2 are shown in Figure S1. It has been observed that the sprayed adhesive exhibits
smooth surface with the main element of carbon, whereas the hydrophobic
SiO2 nanoparticles with an average diameter size of 16
nm contain carbon, oxygen, and silicon. Furthermore, the FTIR spectra
of spray adhesive and modified SiO2 are shown in Figure S2a; it can be seen that the main composition
of spray adhesive is hydrocarbon. In the spectra of hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles, the two intense peaks of 3471 and 1105 cm–1 can be attributed to the silanol group and Si–O–Si
structure.27,45 C–H stretching and C–H bending
were detected at 2962 and 1373 cm–1, respectively,
which further indicated the presence of CH3 due to the
silanization of SiO2 nanoparticles by DDS. Inspired by
the reinforced concrete structure that widely used in construction
engineering, here, we present a superhydrophobic coating with a ferroconcrete
structure where the adhesive particles are used as a skeleton and
the SiO2 nanoparticles are used as the filler. In order
to fabricate this structure, the adhesive particles and SiO2 nanoparticles were sprayed consecutively and repetitively onto the
substrate. This composite coating is well mixed and randomly distributed
the adhesive and SiO2 nanoparticles.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the fabrication
procedure of the superhydrophobic surface.

The silicon
wafer coated with six cycles of spray adhesive/SiO2 composite
coating was used to investigate the properties of coating. The cross-sectional
SEM images showed that the average thickness of as-prepared coating
is about 180 μm (as shown in Figure 2a,b) According to the surface topography,
it is obvious that the coating is composed of region A (smooth) and
region B (rough). Moreover, the higher resolution SEM images and EDS
analysis of region A and region B are shown in Figure 2c,d, respectively. It can be confirmed that
region A belongs to spray adhesive and region B belongs to SiO2 nanoparticles. From the distribution maps of characteristic
elements corresponding to spray adhesive and SiO2 (Figure 2e), it can be clearly
seen that the SiO2 nanoparticles are immobilized over the
substrate by spray adhesive. Besides, the spray adhesive and SiO2 nanoparticles were superimposed and well mixed.

wafer. (c) SEM images and EDX analysis of region A; (d) SEM images
and EDX analysis of region B. (e) Element distribution maps of the
cross section of the coated silicon wafer.

The
surface morphologies of coated glass slide were also analyzed by field
emission SEM and are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that the surface of pristine glass
slide was smooth and neat (Figure 3a), whereas the as-prepared glass slide coated with
SiO2 nanoparticles exhibits a dual-scale rough structure
(Figure 3b,c). The
nanoscale surface roughness of coating was further confirmed by the
atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (Figure 3d). Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 3e, before spray-coating treatment,
the signals of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Ca, which were the dominant
elements of glass, were detected.44 However,
after being coated with spray adhesive and SiO2 nanoparticles,
obvious increase of C signals from 3.90 to 29.36% was detected by
EDX analysis, which can be contributed to the existence of hydrophobic
SiO2 coating and spray adhesive (Figure 3f). This conclusion can be further confirmed
by the XPS spectrum of as-prepared superhydrophobic glass slides,
as shown in Figure S2b.

and (b,c) coated glass slide. (d) AFM image of coated glass slide.

The wettability
of pristine and coated substrates was also measured. The pristine
glass slide exhibited hydrophilic property with a WCA of ∼38°
(Figure 4a). However,
the water droplets stayed in spherical shape on the as-prepared glass
slide with a WCA of ∼160°, indicating that the coated
glass slide performs excellent superhydrophobic property (Figure 4b). Additionally,
the as-prepared slide exhibited not only superhydrophobicity but also
ultralow adhesion to a water droplet. The rolling process of a water
droplet (5 μL) on the as-prepared slide is shown in Figure 5a (Movie S1, Supporting Information). The extreme tilt angle
of the slide when the water droplet began to roll was only 1.5°,
which means the (sliding angle) SA is 1.5°. There was no obvious
change in superhydrophobicity by the increase of spraying cycles (Figure S3). As shown in Figure 5b, a water droplet (4 μL) was forced
to sufficiently contact with the coated slide; when the droplet was
lift up, it remained in spherical shape and there was not any residual
water on the coated slide (Movie S2, Supporting
Information), confirming the ultralow adhesion of this superhydrophobic
surface. This superhydrophobic state can be analyzed by the Cassie–Baxter
state where the air is trapped in the valley of the rough structures
and greatly curtails the contact area between solid and water surface.4,46,47 The wettability transformation
of glass slide from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic could be linked
to the two factors: the dual-scale rough structures obtained from
SiO2 nanoparticles and the low surface energy of DDS. On
the contrary, it was found that the as-prepared slide exhibits excellent
superoleophilic characteristic. Figure 5c shows that when an oil droplet was added dropwise
on the coated surface, it would quickly spread out and fully wet the
surface within 0.24 s (Movie S3, Supporting
Information). Besides, the transmittance curves and optical images
of coated glass slides with different spraying cycles are shown in Figure S4; it can be seen that the coated glass
slides were highly transparent and their transparency decreased with
the increase in spraying cycles.

Mechanical
Robustness
Abrasion test was examined to be a universal method
to assess the durability of the as-prepared superhydrophobic surface
against the physical force.48−50 In this work, a glass slide was engaged for abrasion test by using
a sand paper, as shown in Figure 6. The as-prepared glass sample was situated face down
to the sandpaper (aluminum oxide sandpaper of 800 mesh) under a weight
of 100 g and moved for 20 cm along the ruler (Figure 6a,b). The one reciprocating slide is prescribed
as one cycle of abrasion, and the WCAs were measured after every 15
cycles. The WCAs of the as-prepared glass slide with different spraying
cycles and after abrasion are shown in Figure 6c. It can be clearly seen that the robustness
of the as-prepared glass slide increased greatly with the increase
in number of spraying cycles. Moreover, the coated glass slide with
six spraying cycles remained its superhydrophobic property (WCA >
150° and SA < 10°) even after 325 abrasion cycles, displaying
great mechanical abrasion resistance of the coated glass slide. This
ferroconcrete structure superhydrophobic coating exhibited outstanding
performance in enhancing the mechanical robustness. The coated glass
slide with six spraying cycles could withstand over 325 abrasion cycles,
which is nearly 10 times longer than that reported in previous refs (44) and (51). Additionally, the characterization
of the glass slides coated with six spraying cycles including their
appearance, wettability, and surface morphology is shown in Figure 7. It can be seen
that more and more black substance appears on the surface with the
increase of abrasion cycle, which can be attributed to the residual
of abrasion grains from sand paper. After 600 times of abrasion cycle,
although the WCA of the as-prepared glass slide is slightly decreased,
its surface was still completely protected by spray adhesive/SiO2 nanoparticle composite coating, showing excellent mechanical
robustness.

respectively). The water (dyed blue) was used to test the wettability.

Oil/Water Separation
This universal superhydrophobic and superoleophilic coating fabrication
method could be utilized to prepare oil/water separation materials.
By using the spray “adhesive + hydrophobic paint” method,
we coated the hydrophobic silica nanoparticles on porous substrate
surfaces (e.g., stainless steel mesh and sponge). Then, the coated
porous substrates were employed to selectively filtrate or adsorb
oil from the oil/water mixture.

After spray coating treatment,
the mesh wires were wrapped by SiO2 nanoparticles and showed
hierarchical rough structure (Figure S5). Moreover, the coated mesh exhibited excellent water-repellent
property and had a low sliding angle of ∼2° (Figure S6). The oil/water separation experiments
are conducted, as shown in Figure 8a,b. When the oil/water mixture was poured into the
upper tube, it can be seen that only the oil (CCl4) could
permeate the as-prepared mesh and flow inside the beaker placed below.
All the water was hold above the surface because of the superhydrophobic
property of the coated mesh (see Figure 8a and Movie S4). Hence, the coated mesh could realize the separation of oil and
water by a simple filtering method. On the contrary, when the oil/water
mixture was drained onto the pristine mesh, both oil and water could
pass though the mesh, resulting in the failure of separation (Figure 8b and Movie S5). In addition, a superhydrophobic and
superoleophilic sponge was prepared through the same method. As shown
in Figure 8c, the coated
sponge exhibited great superhydrophobic property. When the as-prepared
sponge was brought into contact with the oil/water mixture, the oil
(decane) was fully absorbed by the coated sponge within few seconds
and left pure neat water in the beaker. The as-prepared superhydrophobic/superoleophilic
mesh/sponge could separate diverse oil/water mixtures with high efficiency
of above 98% (Figure 9a).

(b) Relationship between the pore diameters and intrusion pressure
of coated meshes (the inset is the experimental setup).

To further thoroughly understand the separation mechanism
of as-prepared superhydrophobic and superoleophilic porous materials,
the liquid-wetting model is shown in Figure S7. The pores were assumed to have cylindrical geometry; the breakthrough
pressure (ΔPC) can be determined
by the Young–Laplace equation52 2  where γL is the
surface tension of the liquid and θ is the intrinsic contact
angle of the liquid on the flat surface. The rp represents the pore radius. As inferred from eq 2, the superhydrophobic surface can
withstand a certain external pressure because of ΔPC > 0 (Figure S6a). In the
meanwhile, the oil can spontaneously pass through this superoleophilic
surface because of ΔPC < 0 (positive
capillary effect), as shown in Figure S6b. Furthermore, the oil can be trapped into the rough structure and
form oil film on the surface during the separation process, which
will prevent the water droplet contacting with the solid surface,
thus resulting in under-oil superhydrophobicity. Therefore, the water
cannot permeate through the surface that immersed in oil (Figure S6c). If the superhydrophobic surface
is drenched in water, the air will be trapped into the rough structure
and form an air layer between surface microstructure and surrounding
water.53 In this scenario, once the oil
was dropped on this surface, it will enter into this thin air layer
and quickly spread out under water pressure and capillary effect (Figure S6d). Therefore, the superhydrophobic
and superoleophilic porous materials could allow the oil to pass through
freely, whereas repel water completely. Intrusion pressure is a crucial
property for the oil/water separation material, which is defined as
the maximal pressure that the material surface can support. In order
to ensure the separation of oil and water, the external liquid pressure
should be kept less than intrusion pressure. The intrusion pressure
of as-prepared meshes with different pore sizes is shown in Figure 9b; it can be seen
that the coated mesh could support a high external pressure up to
3430 Pa, and their intrusion pressure decreased with the increase
of pore size.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have presented a facile and versatile strategy
to prepare environmentally friendly, mechanically robust, and superhydrophobic
surfaces with excellent transparency by the spraying method, which
is applicable for both hard and soft substrates. The coated substrates
exhibited excellent superhydrophobic property and ultralow adhesion
with water. Moreover, they retained superhydrophobicity even after
325 sandpaper abrasion cycles, showing outstanding mechanical robustness.
Furthermore, the coated surfaces can also be employed to separate
oil/water mixtures because of their characteristics of being simultaneously
superhydrophobic and superoleophilic. In short, it is believed that
this superhydrophobic surface fabrication method is significant, promising,
and feasible for plenty of industrial applications.
