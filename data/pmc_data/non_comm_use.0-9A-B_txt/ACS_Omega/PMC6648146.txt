Accurate modeling of thermophysical
properties of solvent/bitumen
mixtures is critical for proper design and implementation of thermal-
and solvent-based bitumen recovery processes. In this study, three
generalized correlations were developed for prediction of solubility,
density, and viscosity of light hydrocarbon/bitumen mixtures. The
generalized correlations were developed using symbolic regression
based on genetic programming and employing a 10-year set of comprehensive
phase behavior experimental studies conducted under the SHARP research
program on solvent-aided thermal recovery of bitumen. The data set
comprised Surmont, JACOS, Mackay River, and Cold Lake bitumen samples
and five light hydrocarbon solvents including methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, and n-pentane. The developed
correlations are valid for gaseous solvents. Finally, the developed
correlations for solubility, density, and viscosity were validated
against a large data set of experimental measurements collected from
the literature. The validation demonstrates that the developed correlations
are able to accurately predict the available experimental data of
solubility, density, and viscosity reported in the literature.

1 Introduction
Oil will continue to be
the largest source of energy in the world
with oil demand projected to increase by 12 percent from 2016 to 2040.1 With the constant depletion of the conventional
oil resources, the scarceness of new conventional oil discoveries,
and the deficiency to meet the increase in energy demand, global heavy
oil and bitumen become increasingly important. For instance, in Canada,
oil sands production has exceeded conventional oil production since
2010. In 2017, oil sands production was reported to be 2.7 MMBD compared
to 1.5 MMBD of conventional oil production.2 From a global perspective, it is estimated that the unconventional
oil reserves (heavy oil, extra heavy oil, and bitumen) exceed 6 trillion
barrels which is equivalent to about 70% of the total fossil fuels
energy resources in the world.3 Also, the
global heavy oil and bitumen production is expected to increase from
13 to 18 MMBD by 2035.4 However, because
of the high viscosity of heavy oil and bitumen, traditional processes
of conventional oil recovery are not usually applicable, and therefore,
enhanced oil recovery methods are developed in the past few decades
to economically produce heavy oil and bitumen.

There are primarily
two methods involved when it comes to extracting
oil sands and bitumen: the open-pit mining method and the in situ
recovery. The in situ method can be further subdivided into thermal
and nonthermal recovery methods. The thermal in situ recovery processes
that are widely used and economically viable are: steam assisted gravity
drainage (SAGD), and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS). The nonthermal
recovery methods include cold heavy oil production and vapor extraction.

In Canada, however, as 80% of the oil sands reserves are too deep
for mining, it is only accessible via in situ recovery processes.
Therefore, the viability of the SAGD process comes from the fact that
most of the oil sands deposits that is too deep for mining is also
too shallow for high pressure steam injection processes such as the
CSS process. Hence, SAGD presents the most economically viable option
and is considered the most widely used in situ recovery method in
Canada.5 Despite the commercial success
of thermal in situ processes such as SAGD and CSS, they present multiple
challenges including considerable supply cost, high-energy intensity,
high GHG emissions, and substantial water consumption.6

In the past two decades, operators have been experimenting
on innovative
technologies to reduce the high-energy intensity and water consumption
of thermal in situ processes. Two processes which have recently gained
increased industrial interest are the solvent-assisted process (SA-SAGD)
and pure solvents injection process (Nsolv). SAGD with solvent co-injection
was developed by Nasr and Isaacs in 2002. The fundamental mechanism
of the process is that solvent condenses with steam around the cold
formation interface of the steam chamber causing oil dilution and
viscosity reduction. The compound effect of the solvent with heat
has the potential to provide higher bitumen production rates that
is equivalent or even higher than those of steam-only injection processes.

The current development and pilots of solvent-based processes are
limited and that could be attributed to the lack of experimental data
and thermophysical modeling of solvent/bitumen systems. Therefore,
fundamental understanding of the phase behavior and the effects of
the solvent on bitumen thermophysical properties are not fully understood,
and such knowledge is essential for proper modeling, design, and implementation
of solvent-based recovery processes.

Several experimental studies
have been carried out to study the
phase behavior of solvent/bitumen mixtures, but most of these studies
are limited to low temperature conditions, and therefore not quite
applicable at in situ conditions. For the past 10 years, SHARP research
consortium aimed at studying phase behavior of solvent/bitumen mixtures
and experimentally determining the thermophysical properties of several
solvents/bitumen mixtures for a wide range of temperature and pressure
conditions. These properties include solubility, viscosity, and density
of several solvent/bitumen systems.

Artificial intelligence
has been applied to multiple aspects in
the oil and gas industry and has further gained increased interest
lately with the development of smart computational techniques. Below,
we provide few applications of artificial intelligence with a focus
on genetic algorithm (GA) used on thermophysical properties of heavy
oil/solvent mixtures. Emera and Sarma7 developed
empirical correlations using a GA-based technique to predict CO2 solubility, oil swilling factor, CO2/oil density,
and CO2/oil viscosity for both dead and live oils. They
found that the GA-based correlations yielded more accurate predictions
when compared with other published correlations. Tatar et al.8 applied the intelligent model named radial basis
function network optimized by GA to estimate diluted heavy oil viscosity
mixed with kerosene. The proposed model was found accurate in estimation
of viscosity of the mixture for their target data. Recently, Daryasafar
and Shahbazi9 used an adaptive neurofuzzy
interference system to predict the effect of methane, ethane, propane,
butane, carbon dioxide, and n-hexane on the density
of undersaturated Athabasca bitumen on wide ranges of operating conditions.
Their proposed model showed superiority in predicting bitumen density
at different conditions. Baghban et al.10 modeled the viscosity of Athabasca bitumen with n-tetradecane using the least square support vector machine method.
Finally, Rostami et al.11 modeled bitumen/n-tetradecane mixture density using gene expression programming
as a function of solvent composition, pressure, and temperature. Their
developed model predicts the mixture density with an AARD % of 0.3%.

The aim of this study is to model and develop generalized correlations
for a 10 year set of experimental data of the SHARP research program,
namely, solubility, density, and viscosity of several solvent/bitumen
systems. These newly developed correlations are valid for the entire
range of conditions and parameters investigated with high degree of
accuracy. There have been no universal correlations developed in the
literature that can accurately predict thermophysical properties of
several solvent/bitumen mixtures, and therefore, these correlations
can be utilized to understand the phase behavior and determine the
thermodynamic properties of solvent-based recovery processes. Furthermore,
these correlations can be readily used to develop fluid models for
commercial numerical reservoir simulators and properly design solvent-based
thermal recovery processes.

This paper is structured as follows:
first, the range of applicability
and parameters used in the newly developed correlations is presented.
Next, details of the methodology utilized to develop the correlations
are discussed. Then, the three developed correlations for solubility,
density, and viscosity is presented along with their accuracy metrics.
Lastly, the correlations are further validated and compared with available
experimental data from the literature.

2 Methodology
We use the software Eureqa12 for the
development of the empirical correlations in this study. Eureqa is
a symbolic regression (SR) software using genetic programming, created
by Cornell’s Creative Machines Lab and later commercialized
by Nutonian. SR is the technique of finding a symbolic function that
describes a data set. The developed symbolic function/model is then
used to predict response behaviors and facilitate the understanding
of the interconnection between the data set-independent variables
and the desired response variable. The SR technique of Eureqa software
uses genetic programming (GP) in which a set of functions are allowed
to breed and mutate with the genetic propagation into subsequent generations
based upon a survival-of-the-fittest criteria.13

The generic implementation of a GP is to first feed
the program
with training and validation data sets. The data splitting between
training and validation can be customized as required. In this case
study, the validation data set was selected randomly based on an internal
algorithm of Eureqa software. Then, a random symbolic function generator
creates solutions by combining operands and arithmetic operators (constant,
variables, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Other
advanced arithmetic operators such as power, logarithms, and exponential
functions can be included as well in the search of the optimal solutions.14 The operands used in this study are: constants,
variables, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logarithms,
exponentials, power, and square root. The obtained solutions are then
compared with the validation data set by using a chosen error metric
such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, R2 goodness of fit, correlation coefficient, and so forth.
The error metric used in this case study is the mean absolute error.
Unfit solutions are abandoned, and good solutions are retained and
further combined/mutated with new subexpressions until further satisfactory
solutions emerge. Several satisfactory solutions are provided in the
GP process with different accuracy and complexity levels. The best
solutions are found based on the Pareto front which describes accuracy
versus complexity.14Figure 1 illustrates the concept of the SR process
using genetic programming.

Figure 1 SR using the genetic programming—process
diagram.

Even though the predictive ability
of the developed symbolic model
overall increases with increasing complexity, conventionally, simple
solutions with generally reasonable accuracy and sound forms are strongly
desired. In this study, conventional mathematical expressions known
in the literature for solubility, density, and viscosity models were
imposed into Eureqa software in order to develop physically sound
predictive models with the least complex forms and the highest prediction
accuracy achievable (>97%).

3 SHARP Experimental Data
This study is implemented utilizing a 10-year set of comprehensive
experimental data conducted by the SHARP research program at the University
of Calgary which pertains to measuring thermodynamic properties of
several solvent/bitumen mixtures at a wide range of temperature and
pressure setting. This research focuses on modeling the experimental
measurements of solubility, density, and viscosity of solvent/bitumen
systems. Several experimental studies have been conducted on phase
behavior of solvent/bitumen mixtures.15−29 The experimental data set used in this study conducted on four bitumen
samples, Surmont, JACOS, Mackay River, and Cold Lake, which covers
a wide range of the diverse Athabasca bitumen characteristics. The
solvents used with each of the bitumen samples are C1 to
C5, which represents the most commonly used vapor solvents
for typical solvent-aided thermal recovery processes. A statistical
summary of the temperature/pressure settings covered in the SHARP
experimental studies along with the measured solubilities, densities,
and viscosities are presented in Table 1 below.

The temperature and pressure ranges
of SHARP experiments are shown
in Figure 2 as a function
of bitumen samples and solvents used. As noted from the figure, the
temperature and pressure settings cover a wide range that is applicable
for most in situ conditions of solvent-aided thermal recovery processes.

of bitumen samples and solvents used (C1–C3, n-C4, and n-C5).

4 Modeling the Solubility of
Light Hydrocarbon
Solvents/Bitumen Mixtures
Conventionally, solubility is expressed
as a function of temperature
and pressure for each solvent independent of bitumen sample characteristics.
This may not be a valid assumption especially in the case of heavy
hydrocarbon solvents such as liquid propane, butane, and pentane,
and nonhydrocarbon solvents such as dimethyl ether (DME). However,
our intention was to develop a generalized correlation that predicts
the solubility of gaseous hydrocarbon solvents (C1–C3, n-C4, and n-C5) mixed with a typical Athabasca-type bitumen. Therefore,
it is necessary to incorporate other parameters that relates solvents
and bitumen characteristics into the developed correlation. The additional
parameters selected to characterize the solvent type are acentric
factor ω and critical temperature Tc. For the bitumen sample, molecular weight of bitumen Mb was chosen. Despite having many other parameters that
can be utilized to characterize the solvent used and bitumen type,
these specific parameters were selected as they are widely used and
readily available in the literature. Therefore, the correlation developed
can be easily implemented to predict the solubility of any light hydrocarbon
solvents mixed with typical Athabasca bitumen with a known molecular
weight.

4.1 Development of Solubility Correlation
Initially,
to examine the influence of the independent parameters
on solubility, all parameters were correlated individually against
solubility. Figure 3 illustrates the correlation matrix plot for all the independent
variables impacting solubility. The independent variables are basically
the temperature, pressure, molecular weight of bitumen, and solvent
type (characterized by the critical temperature or acentric factor
of the solvent). As shown from Figure 3, the most influential parameter affecting solubility
is the solvent type (defined by critical temperature of solvent) with
a correlation coefficient of 0.62. The pressure parameter comes next
in impacting the solubility of the solvent into bitumen with a correlation
coefficient of 0.41. Temperature is slightly influential where it
negatively impacts the solubility variable. The molecular weight of
the Athabasca bitumen does not seem to influence the solubility and
that could be attributed to the relatively low variability of the
bitumen molecular weight data. The four bitumen samples used in the
analysis are Surmont, JACOS, MacKay River, and Cold Lake with the
molecular weight ranging between 500 and 550 g/g·mol.

Figure 3 Correlation
matrix—independent variables impacting solubility
parameter—blue = C1, red = C2, green
= C3, purple = n-C4, and black
= n-C5.

Next, nonlinear regression was performed on the experimental
solubility
data set using genetic programming to find a generalized mathematical
expression correlating the abovementioned independent variables with
solubility. The following correlation was found to best describe solubility xs in terms of temperature and pressure settings
and solvent characteristics (Tc and ω). 1  where xs is the
mole fraction of the solvent in bitumen, ω is the solvent acentric
factor, T is the temperature in K, Tc is the solvent critical temperature in K, and P is the pressure in MPa. The total number of experimental
data points used in the development of the solubility correlation
(1) is 148. As noted from eq 1, it is a simple correlation yet accurate
for predicting the solubility of light hydrocarbons (C1 to C5) in any typical Athabasca bitumen. The correlation
match along with the error metrics associated is shown in Figure 4. As noted from the
figure, R2 goodness of fit is 0.968. The
pressure and temperature ranges used for the developed correlation
are within 322–463 K and 0.5–8.2 MPa. It is worth noting
that the correlation is only valid for the temperature and pressure
at which the solvent is in the gaseous state (i.e., T > Tsat and P < Psat).

vs predicted along
with the associated error metrics.

4.2 Validation Analysis of the Solubility Correlation
As mentioned previously, the GP software (Eureqa) splits the data
set randomly into training and testing sets using an internal algorithm
to avoid over fitting of the developed model. Therefore, as observed
from Figure 4, the
solubility correlation presents an R2 accuracy
of 0.968 which is also representative of the predictive goodness of
fit. However, to further test the robustness of the developed solubility
correlation and validate its accuracy, a comprehensive experimental
data available in the literature were collected and compared against
the developed solubility correlation. It is worth emphasizing here
that none of the solubility data collected from the literature were
used in the development of the solubility model.

The total number
of data points collected from the literature and used in the validation
analysis which are presented in Figure 5 is 185 points.30−37 As shown from Figure 5, the R2 goodness of fit is relatively
lower than the R2 obtained previously
and that can be attributed to the fact that several of the data points
found from the literature are outside the range of applicability of
the solubility model as shown in Table 2. Also, another important reason for the discrepancy
in R2 goodness of fit is due to the inherent
error associated with the measured solubility results owing to the
difference in the experimental setups and/or human interpretation
of the measured data. For example, Mehrotra and Svrcek31 measured the solubility of methane in Athabasca
bitumen at a temperature of 373 K and pressure of 7.82 MPa to be 0.2344,
whereas the respective solubility measured by the SHARP experiments
for methane at the same temperature and pressure is 0.27. Despite
having a lower R2 goodness of fit of 0.86,
the model is still fairly accurate and robust to be used in the prediction
of solubility data in the absence of experimental measurements with
only ∼13% margin of error. A summary of the validation data
set collected from the literature is presented in Table 3 along with the associated R2 goodness of fit for each study.

solubility correlation along with associated error metrics.

Badamchi-Zadeh et al.37	313–323	0.8–1.6	Athabasca	552	C3	7	0.82	
It is worth noting from Table 2 that the study conducted by Mehrotra and
Svrcek36 is based on the Wabasca bitumen
sample which
has a reported molecular weight of 446.5 g/g·mol that is lower
than the range of applicability of the developed solubility correlation.
Nonetheless, the developed solubility correlation provides fairly
accurate predictions with less than 12% margin of error. The same
can be said about the studies conducted by Mehrotra and Svrcek35 and Badmachi-Zadeh et al.;37 the range of temperature and pressure settings for most
of the data points in these studies is outside the range of applicability
of the developed correlation, yet the solubility correlation provides
accurate predictions with less than 13% margin of error. This demonstrates
the versatility of the developed correlation in predicting solubilities
even for data points outside applicable ranges of temperature, pressure,
and bitumen sample types.

Furthermore, it is possible to use
the solubility correlation presented
to model new experimental solubility measurements for other solvents
or bitumen samples. A parametric correlation suggested to model any
solubility data with parameters a to j to be regressed on the new experimental data. 2  

For example, Mehrotra and Svrcek33 measured
the solubility of CO2 in bitumen and to show the adaptability
of correlation given by eq 2, their measured data were modeled using the suggested correlation.
Parameters a to j were regressed
and optimized to model their experimental data. Figure 6 shows the results of the regression in which
the R2 goodness of fit obtained in this
case is 0.976. Although the solubility correlation was developed for
hydrocarbon solvents, the correlation is capable of modeling nonhydrocarbon
solvents as well. It should be mentioned that the proposed correlation
(eq 2) are applicable
to predict solubility of vapor and gaseous CO2 in bitumen.
It cannot be implemented in the TP regions where CO2 is
in the liquid phase and forms liquid–liquid equilibrium systems
with bitumen.

To further demonstrate the adaptability of the solubility
correlation
(2) in modeling the solubility of other solvents
in bitumen, Haddadnia et al.39 measured
the solubility of DME in Athabasca bitumen for a wide range of temperatures
and pressures. Their experimental data were modeled using correlation
(2) in which parameters a to j were regressed and optimized. Figure 7 shows the results of the regression for
which the R2 goodness of fit obtained
in this case is 0.984.

Figure 7 Modeling DME solubility in Athabasca bitumen39 using the correlation given by eq 2.

5 Modeling the Density of Light Hydrocarbon Solvents/Bitumen
Mixtures
The experimental density measurements were modeled
using the following
equation 3  where ρm is the
mixture density
in kg/m3, ws is the mass fraction
of the solvent in bitumen, and ρs and ρb are the densities of the solvent and bitumen components in
kg/m3, respectively. Equation 3 is developed based on the assumption of no volume
change upon mixing. In this case, it is assumed that the volumes of
the individual components are additive, and the mixture is a regular
solution. Even though solvent/bitumen mixtures are not considered
regular solutions and exhibit volume change upon mixing, eq 3 provides reasonable density predictions
based on the work of several researchers. Saryazdi,40 for example, reported 1% AARD in predicting mixture densities
for ethane, propane, and n-butane as dissolved gas
and n-decane, toluene, and cyclooctane as the heavier
liquid component through using the no volume change upon mixing rule
(eq 3). Also, Kariznovi29 used eq 3 in predicting n-heptane with the Surmont
bitumen mixture and reported that the results are in agreement with
the measured data within 1.12% AARD.

First, to study the effect
of the independent parameters on density
variables, all parameters were correlated individually against density. Figure 8 illustrates the
correlation matrix plot for all the independent variables that may
affect density. The independent variables are the temperature, pressure,
molecular weight of bitumen, solvent mass fraction, and solvent characteristics
(critical temperature/acentric factor of the solvent). As shown in Figure 8, the most influential
parameter affecting density is the mass fraction of the solvent with
a correlation coefficient of −0.87. The solvent type (critical
temperature) is the second highest influential parameter with a correlation
coefficient of −0.7. The temperature variable comes third.
As noted from Figure 7, all influential parameters are negatively correlated with density
except for the molecular weight of bitumen.

parameters impacting density
variable—blue = C1, red = C2, green =
C3, purple = n-C4, and black

5.1 Modeling Liquid Density of Light Hydrocarbon
Pure Components (C1–C5)
One
of the challenges encountered when modeling mixture densities is handling
light/gaseous solvents. At the pure state, the gas (solvent) densities
is well defined, but when mixed with heavier components, they are
more like a liquid.40 This usually results
in underprediction of mixture densities. Therefore, several approaches
were suggested by researchers such as accounting for the excess volume
in the prediction of the densities40 and/or
using the concept of “effective” liquid density41 to predict the densities of light/gaseous solvents
(ρs) when mixed with heavier liquid components. The
“effective” liquid density is a hypothetical liquid
density for the gas solvent component when it is part of the liquid
mixture.

The approach used to handle the prediction of density
of gaseous solvents (ρs) in this study is different
from the methods available in the literature and discussed above.
Actual liquid densities of pure light hydrocarbon components (C1 to n-C5) were taken from the
NIST database.42 A correlation was developed
for the obtained liquid densities of light hydrocarbon components
using genetic programing. The developed correlation can be utilized
to predict pseudo liquid densities of light hydrocarbon components
beyond the temperature and pressure conditions at which the component
is in the liquid state. For example, propane at a pressure of 1 MPa
is in the liquid state at temperatures between 90.5 and 300 K. The
developed correlation predicts the liquid density of propane at this
pressure and temperature range with an AARD of 2%. The same correlation
is applied to temperatures beyond 300 K when the gaseous solvent is
dissolved in a liquid mixture to predict the pseudo liquid density. Figure 9 illustrates the
actual propane density obtained from NIST at a pressure of 1 MPa.
The developed correlation is used to predict the actual liquid density
of propane as shown in the solid black curve. The red curve shows
the pseudo liquid densities of propane for temperatures beyond 300
K using the same developed correlation.

Figure 9 Propane liquid densities
at 1 MPa—actual vs modeled.

The generalized correlation developed to model the liquid
densities
of light hydrocarbon components (C1 to n-C5) to be used in prediction of mixture density is given
by 4  where T and Tc are the
temperature of the system and critical temperature
of the solvent in K, respectively, and ρs is the
density of the pure solvent in kg/m3. This correlation
is valid in predicting the liquid densities of pure C1 to n-C5 with an AARD of 3.29% and R2 goodness of fit of 0.944. Figure 10 below shows the actual liquid densities
of C1 to n-C5 versus the predicted
densities along with the associated error metrics.

correlation plot—actual vs predicted along with the associated
error metrics.

5.2 Modeling
Density of Pure Bitumen
A generalized correlation was developed
to predict the density of
pure bitumen (ρb) using genetic programming, Eureqa
software. The density of four bitumen samples measured in the SHARP
research program were used in the development of the bitumen density
correlation: Surmont, MacKay River, JACOS, and Cold Lake. The range
of temperature and pressure of the experimental measurement of pure
bitumen samples are 308.15–451.15 K and 1.12–10.43 MPa,
respectively. The reported molecular weights of the bitumen samples
are 540, 513, 530, and 534 for Surmont, MacKay River, JACOS, and Cold
Lake, respectively. It should be noted that these values have been
measured using the freezing point depression method with benzene solvent.
The obtained correlation is given by 5  where Mb is the
molecular weight of the bitumen sample in g/g·mol, T and P are temperatures in K and pressure in MPa,
respectively, and ρb is bitumen density in kg/m3. As noted from the developed correlation (5), it is quite simple with only three parameters: T, P, and Mb. However, this correlation is highly accurate with an R2 goodness of fit of 0.986 and an AARD of 0.228%. Figure 11 shows the accuracy
plot of all bitumen density measurements versus predicted ones using eq 5, along with the error
metrics associated.

predicted,
along with the associated error metrics.

5.3 Modeling Mixture Densities of Solvent/Bitumen
Binary Systems
Having modeled pure solvent densities and
pure bitumen densities (eqs 4 and 5), now it is possible to predict
experimental densities of solvent/bitumen mixtures using eq 3 presented previously. By combining eqs 4 and 5 with eq 3, the complete
generalized correlation to predict mixture densities of light hydrocarbon
solvents/bitumen binary systems is given by 6  

The developed correlation (6) was found to best describe density in terms of
temperature and pressure, solvent mass fraction, molecular weight
of bitumen, and critical temperature of solvent. As noted from correlation 6, it is a simple correlation with two separate terms
for calculation of the pseudo liquid density of solvent and pure bitumen
densities. The generalized correlation (6) is
accurate for predicting the mixture densities of light hydrocarbons
(C1 to n-C5) dissolved in any
typical Athabasca bitumen. The correlation match along with the error
metrics associated is shown in Figure 12. Again, the pressure and temperature ranges
used for the developed correlation are within 322–463 K and
0.5–8.2 MPa, respectively. It is worth noting that the correlation
is only valid for the temperature and pressure at which the solvent
is in the gaseous state (i.e., T > Tsat and P < Psat).

Figure 12 Mixture density correlation plot—experimental vs
predicted,
along with the associated error metrics.

The total number of experimental data points used in the
development
of the mixture density correlation (6) and illustrated
by Figure 12 is 186
which comprised four bitumen samples with molecular weight ranging
from 500 to 550 g/g·mol and five hydrocarbon solvents, C1 to n-C5. As noted from Figure 12, the R2 goodness of fit obtained is 0.97 and the associated
AARD is 0.92%.

5.4 Validation Analysis of
the Density Correlation
As noted earlier, the GP software
(Eureqa) splits the data set
randomly into training and testing sets using an internal algorithm
to avoid over fitting of the developed model. Accordingly, as noted
from Figure 12, the
density correlation (6) gives an R2 accuracy of 0.975 that is for both sets of data: training
and testing sets. However, to further assess the robustness of the
developed density correlation and confirm its accuracy in prediction,
a comprehensive experimental data available in literature were collected
and compared against the developed density correlation. It is worth
emphasizing here that none of the density data collected from the
literature were used in the development of the density correlation.

The total number of data points collected from the literature and
used in the validation analysis for density which are presented in Figure 13 is 169 data points.
As shown in Figure 13, the R2 accuracy for prediction is 0.894
which is lower than the R2 obtained previously
in Figure 12. This
can be attributed to the fact that several of the data points found
from literature are outside the range of applicability of the density
model as shown in Table 3. Also, another significant reason for the discrepancy in R2 prediction accuracy is the inherent error
associated with the experimental density measurements due to the difference
in either the experimental setups and/or human interpretation when
measuring the data. Despite having a lower R2 prediction accuracy of 0.894, the model is still fairly robust
to predict mixture densities in the absence of experimental measurements
with only ∼10% margin of error. A summary of the validation
data set collected from the literature is presented in Table 2 below along with the associated
AARD for each study.

It is
worth noting from Table 3 that the study conducted by Mehrotra and Svrcek36 is based on the Wabasca bitumen sample which
has a reported molecular weight of 446.5 g/g·mol that is lower
than the range of applicability of the developed solubility correlation.
Nonetheless, the developed density correlation provides very accurate
predictions with only 0.76% AARD. The only data set presented a poor
prediction is Mehrotra and Svrcek35 where
the obtained AARD is 3%. This could be attributed to the difference
in bitumen sample composition and characteristics as they used the
Peace River bitumen sample which was not part of the data sets used
in the development of the density correlation. Overall, the validation
data sets demonstrate the versatility of the developed correlation
in predicting densities even for data points outside applicable ranges
of temperature, pressure, and bitumen sample types.

In addition,
it is possible to use the density correlation presented
to model new experimental density measurements for other solvents
or bitumen samples. Equation 7 below presents the parametric correlation suggested to model
any density data with parameters a0 to a4 and b0 to b4 to be regressed on the new experimental data. 7  

For example, Haddadnia et al.39 measured
the density of DME in Athabasca bitumen for a wide range of temperatures
and pressures, and to show the adaptability of correlation given by eq 7, parameters a0 to a4 and b0 to b4 were regressed and
optimized to model their experimental data. The R2 goodness of fit obtained is 0.99 and the correlation
of best fit is given by a0 = −76.9, a1 = 0.16, a2 = −5.14
× 103, a3 = 12.7, a4 = 175, b0 = −24.2, b1 = 16.3, b2 = 6.45
× 103, b3 = 42.1, b4 = 25.8. Although the parametric density correlation
(7) was developed for light hydrocarbon solvents,
the correlation is capable of modeling other solvents as well with
great accuracy.

6 Modeling the Viscosity of
Light Hydrocarbon
Solvents/Bitumen Mixtures
The experimental viscosity measurements
were modeled using the
fourth root mixing rule,43 which is extensively
used in refinery calculations 8  where
μm is the mixture viscosity
in cP, ws is the mass fraction of solvent
in bitumen, μs and μb are the viscosities
of the solvent and bitumen components in cP, respectively. The fourth
root mixing rule, also known by the quarter-law mixing rule, was found
to provide superior results when compared to the typically used logarithmic-based
mixing rule.

The same process was performed on the viscosity
experimental data
set in which the impact of all considered independent variables on
the viscosity was examined. All variables were correlated individually
against viscosity. Figure 14 illustrates the correlation matrix plot for all the independent
variables that may affect viscosity. The independent variables are
the temperature, pressure, molecular weight of bitumen, solvent mass
fraction, and solvent characteristics (critical temperature/acentric
factor of the solvent). As shown in Figure 14, the most influential parameter affecting
viscosity is the temperature of the system with a correlation coefficient
of −0.44. Solvent type (critical temperature) is the second
highest influential parameter with a correlation coefficient of −0.31.
As noted from Figure 14, all independent parameters are negatively correlated with viscosity
except for the molecular weight of bitumen.

variables impacting viscosity—blue

6.1 Modeling
Liquid Viscosity of Light Hydrocarbon
Pure Components (C1–C5)
Similar
challenge as density property is present when modeling the viscosities
of pure light hydrocarbon solvents. At the pure state, the gaseous
solvents viscosity is well defined, but when mixed with heavier components,
they are more like a liquid. Therefore, it is mandated to estimate
pseudo liquid viscosities of gaseous solvents dissolving in bitumen.

There are several correlations proposed in the literature to estimate
pseudo liquid viscosities for solvent/bitumen mixtures which were
found not to be applicable for a wide range of temperature and pressure
settings. For example, Zirrahi et al.16 reported a correlation that can be used in estimating the pseudo
liquid viscosities of solvents dissolving in bitumen. It assumes that
the effective solvent viscosity in the oleic phase is a function of
temperature and pressure of the system: μs = d1 + d2T + d3T2 +
(d4 + d5T)P where T and P are the absolute temperature and pressure in K and MPa,
respectively. It was found that their correlation is not valid for
prediction of the pseudo liquid viscosity of solvents for temperatures
above 450 K.

In this study, a new correlation is proposed to
predict the pseudo
liquid viscosities of light hydrocarbon components (C1 to
C5). The developed correlation is based on actual liquid
viscosities which were taken from the NIST database.42 Through utilizing genetic programming (Eureqa software),
the developed correlation is capable of predicting actual liquid viscosities
of light hydrocarbon component and can further be extended to predict
pseudo liquid viscosities beyond the temperature and pressure conditions
of the components’ liquid state. The developed correlation
is given by 9  where μs is the viscosity
of solvent in cP, and T and Tc are the temperatures of the system and critical temperature
of solvent in K, respectively. As noted from the developed correlation,
it is only a function of temperature and critical temperature of the
solvent type. It is worth emphasizing herein that it is not the objective
to model liquid viscosities of pure solvent components. However, in
order to model and predict mixture viscosities of solvent/bitumen
systems, pseudo liquid viscosities of solvents (μs) need to be defined.

The developed correlation (9) predicts actual
viscosities for C1 to n-C5 with
an R2 accuracy of 0.90. As noted, the
prediction is not highly accurate. However, as mentioned previously,
it is not the intent to perfectly match the pure solvent liquid viscosities,
but to define a good fit and sound representation of pseudo liquid
viscosities that will provide an accurate prediction of mixture viscosities
for solvent/bitumen systems.

6.2 Modeling Viscosity of Pure
Bitumen
A generalized correlation was developed to predict
the viscosity
of pure bitumen (μb) using SR software Eureqa which
utilizes genetic programming. Four bitumen samples experimentally
measured in the SHARP research program were used in the development
of the bitumen viscosity correlation: Surmont, MacKay River, JACOS,
and Cold Lake. The ranges of temperature and pressure of the experimental
measurement of pure bitumen samples are 308.15–451.15 K and
1.12–10.43 MPa, respectively. The reported molecular weights
of the bitumen samples are 540, 513, 530, and 534 for Surmont, MacKay
River, JACOS, and Cold Lake, respectively. The developed correlation
is given by 10  where μb is
the viscosity of pure bitumen in cP and T is the
temperature in K and P is the pressure in MPa. As
noted from the developed correlation (10), it
is simple with only the temperature and pressure parameters as the
independent variables. However, the correlation is highly accurate
to predict pure bitumen viscosities with an R2 goodness of fit of 0.985 and an AARD of 3.5%. Figure 15 shows the accuracy plot of
all bitumen viscosity measurements versus predicted ones using eq 10, along with the error
metrics associated (Figure 16).

vs predicted using eq 9.

vs predicted
along with the associated error metrics.

6.3 Modeling Mixture Viscosities of Solvent/Bitumen
Binary Systems
Correlations 9 and 10 that were developed to predict the viscosities
of pure solvent and pure bitumen components can be combined using
the fourth root mixing role (eq 8) in order to predict experimental mixture viscosities of
solvent/bitumen systems. The complete generalized correlation to predict
mixture viscosities of light hydrocarbon solvents/bitumen binary systems
is given by 11  

The generalized correlation
(11) was found to best describe viscosity in
terms of temperature, pressure, solvent mass fraction, and critical
temperature of solvent (Tc). As noted
from eq 11, it is a
simple correlation where it is composed of two separate terms for
predicting solvent pseudo liquid and pure bitumen viscosities. Nonetheless,
it is quite accurate for predicting the mixture viscosities of light
hydrocarbons (C1 to n-C5) dissolved
in any typical Athabasca bitumen. The correlation match along with
the error metrics associated is shown in Figure 17. The pressure and temperature ranges used
for the developed correlation are 322–463 K and and 0.5–8.2
MPa, respectively. It is worth noting that the correlation is only
valid for the temperature and pressure at which the solvent is in
the gaseous state (i.e. T > Tsat and P < Psat).

Figure 17 Mixture viscosity—experimental vs predicted, along
with
the associated error metrics.

It is worth noting that the viscosity plots are presented
in a
logarithmic base for ease of visualization and proper statistical
analysis. The total number of experimental data points used in the
development of the mixture viscosity correlation (11) and illustrated by Figure 17 is 186 points which covers four bitumen samples ranging
from 500 to 550 g/g·mol and five hydrocarbon solvents: C1 to n-C5.

6.4 Validation
Analysis of the Viscosity Correlation
To assess the robustness
of the developed viscosity correlation
and confirm its accuracy in the prediction of solvent/bitumen mixture
viscosity, a comprehensive experimental data available in the literature
were collected and statistically analyzed against the developed viscosity
correlation. It is worth emphasizing here that none of the viscosity
data collected from the literature were used in the development of
the viscosity correlation.

The total number of data points collected
from the literature and used in the validation analysis for viscosity
predictions which are presented in Figure 18 is 169 points. The R2 coefficient is 0.94 which is lower than the R2 obtained previously in Figure 17. The discrepancy is due to the range of
some of the data points collected being outside the range of applicability
of the developed correlation. In addition, the inherent error/discrepancy
associated with the experimental viscosity measurements of other researchers
when compared to the SHARP studies affect the accuracy of the prediction
results. Notwithstanding, the model is still robust to predict mixture
viscosities and dead bitumen viscosities in the absence of experimental
measurements with only ∼6% margin of error. A summary of the
validation data set collected from the literature is presented in Table 3 below along with
the associated AARD for each study (Table 4).

viscosity correlation.

Badamchi-Zadeh et al.37	377–420	0.101	Athabasca	552	pure bitumen	14	1.58	
Overall, the validation data
sets demonstrate that the developed
correlation can fairly predicts the viscosities of different solvent/bitumen
systems even for datasets outside the range of applicability of the
developed correlation.

In addition, it is possible to use the
viscosity correlation presented
to model new experimental viscosity measurements for other solvents
or bitumen samples. Equation 12 presents the parametric viscosity correlation suggested to
model any viscosity data with parameters a1 to a4 and b1 to b3 to be regressed on the new experimental
data. 12  

7 Summary and Conclusions
This study presented three
generalized correlations for modeling
solubility, density, and viscosity of light hydrocarbon/bitumen systems.
The generalized correlations were developed using SR analysis based
on genetic programming (Eureqa software). The generalized correlations
for solubility, density, and viscosity were developed utilizing a
10-year set of comprehensive experimental data conducted in the SHARP
research program which comprises four bitumen samples ranging from
500 to 550 g/g·mol and five hydrocarbon solvents, C1 to n-C5. The developed correlations
are valid for a wide range of temperature and pressure setting which
covers the conditions of thermally based solvent-aided recovery processes.
Therefore, the generalized correlations can be utilized for proper
design, modeling, and implementation of solvent-aided thermal recovery
processes.

The developed solubility correlation (1)
is only a function of four parameters: temperature, pressure, solvent
critical temperature, and acentric factor. Yet, it provides accurate
predictions of solubilities when validated against a large list of
experimental measurements available in the literature. The solubility
correlation is versatile enough to predict solubilities for data sets
outside the range of applicability of the developed correlation with
the 13% margin of error.

The density correlation (6) was developed
based on the assumption of no volume change upon mixing and therefore
it is essentially composed of two separate and additive parts. The
first part of the correlation (4) is for predicting
pseudo solvent liquid densities and the second part (5) is for predicting pure bitumen densities. In general equation,
(6) provides robust prediction of mixture densities
in the absence of experimental measurements with only ∼10%
margin of error when compared to a large list of experimental measurements
available in literature.

The viscosity correlation was developed
using the fourth root mixing
rule (8). This rule was found to provide better
prediction results when compared to typical logarithmic based mixing
rules used extensively in modeling viscosity measurements. Analogous
to the density correlation, the viscosity correlation (11) is composed of two separate parts for predicting pure solvent
pseudo liquid and pure bitumen viscosities. The viscosity correlation
(11) provides accurate prediction of mixture
viscosities with ∼6% margin of error when validated against
a large list of experimental viscosity measurements available in literature.
