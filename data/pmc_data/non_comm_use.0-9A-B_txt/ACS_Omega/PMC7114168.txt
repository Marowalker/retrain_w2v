The
aggregation of a free base porphyrin, meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin
and its Zn(II) derivative have
been studied at the air/water interface in the presence of a p-tert-butylcalyx[8]arene matrix. The mixed
Langmuir films were obtained either by premixing the compounds (cospreading)
or by sequential addition. The negative deviation from the additivity
rule of the cospread films is indicative of a comparatively good miscibility
that was further confirmed by Brewster angle microscopy. The images
of the cospread mixed films showed a more homogeneous morphology in
comparison with those of pure porphyrin that is attributed to a deeper
and earlier self-aggregation state at the interface of the latter.
These results were similar for both porphyrins and revealed the disaggregating
effect of the calixarene matrix. The orientation and association of
the porphyrins were studied by UV–visible reflection spectroscopy
at the interface. A different aggregation behavior can be inferred
from the resulting spectra, and a higher orientational freedom was
observed when the molecules were less aggregated in mixed cospreaded
films. The disaggregating effect was retained when the films were
transferred to solid supports as demonstrated by UV–visible
spectroscopy. Finally, the potential use of these Langmuir–Blodgett
films as optical gas sensors was tested against ammonia and amine
vapors. The changes in the spectrum in the presence of the volatile
compounds are higher for the Zn-porphyrin. The presence of calixarene
enhances the sensor response due to the higher accessibility of volatiles
to disaggregated porphyrins in the mixed films. The resulting changes
were mapped into a numerical matrix that can be transformed into a
color pattern to easily discriminate among these gases.

Introduction
Research into porphyrins
and derivatives deposited on Langmuir–Blodgett
(LB) films for optical gas sensing continues attracting attention
in defense and environmental applications.1−12 The reason behind this interest relies on the modification of their
electronic structure and, consequently, the UV–visible (UV–vis)
spectrum in the presence of the analyte.4 This electronic structure emerges as a consequence of the conjugation
of the electrons among the aromatic rings and can be tuned by precise
modification of the peripheral positions or by changing the coordinating
metal (if any) of the central hemo core. Hence, when the gas molecules
interact with a specific porphyrin, there is usually a charge transfer
between the macrocycle of the porphyrin and the gas molecule that
provokes a selective and monitorable change in the UV–vis spectra.
It then makes porphyrin, particularly metalloporphyrins, eligible
as good “sensing materials”.13−23 However, the main problem, which carries the structure of the porphyrin
on LB films, is their tendency to self-aggregate into big clusters
when the intermolecular interactions exceed the effect of the hydrophobic
forces and/or steric hindrance. This aggregation causes shifts and
broadenings in the spectra of the transferred LB films and hinders
the access of the gas analyte molecules to the molecular binding sites,
with the subsequent decrease of the response capacity of the films.
Furthermore, it often makes LB films not uniform as a result of unsatisfactory
reproducibility in Langmuir layer transfer from sample to sample.7 Among the possibilities established in the literature,
there are several studies aiming at minimizing the aggregation of
the porphyrin film by adding a calixarene matrix to form mixed films
and enhance the porphyrin organization and uniformity of the LB films.3,4,7,12,24,25 Calixarenes
are macrocycles made up of a varied number of bridged phenol units
with a peculiar and useful supramolecular behavior.26 They often exhibit a good amphiphilic balance between the
lower and upper rim and therefore form high quality monolayers at
the air/water interface and stable and reproducible LB films.27 The disaggregating effect provoked by these
molecules has been also well-established for some complex bare and
branched porphyrins5 and is probably caused
by a mixed action of the dilution and a cage-like process that strongly
affects to the porphyrin organization. In summary, embedding porphyrins
into a calixarene matrix seems to improve the homogeneity of the porphyrin
in the mixed films at the interface and increases the porosity on
the surface in LB layers. This effect allows a better access of gas
molecules through their cavity network to the binding sites of the
porphyrin, which subsequently leads to a faster response under analyte
exposure.3,7

In particular, carboxyphenyl porphyrins
have demonstrated good
sensitivity for the optical detection of different gases and volatile
organic compounds.22,28,29 However, unlike other porphyrin families, no attempts to improve
their structural properties when assembled in LB films have been reported
to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, the ability of a calixarene
to disaggregate two different tetracarboxyphenyl (TCPP) porphyrins
has been demonstrated: the free base and its Zn-metallated analogue.
Specifically, the porphyrins explored in this work are the 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin
(henceforth, p-TCPP) and Zn(II)-5,10,15,20-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin
(henceforth, p-ZnTCPP). In particular, the effect
of adding p-tert-butylcalyx[8]arene
(C8A) to the porphyrin films at the air/water interface has been studied,
extracting information from the pressure–area (π-A) isotherm supported with Brewster angle microscopy images
as well as the effect of the calixarene matrix in the mobility and
aggregation of the molecules at the interface measured by reflection
spectroscopy. All macrocycle compounds are shown in Figure 1. The application of these
optical tools to demonstrate and visualize the disaggregation process
constitutes one of the main novel aspects of the present work. The
effect of the addition of calixarene in the porphyrin LB film properties
by using UV–vis spectroscopy to measure the aggregation degree
after the transference was also considered. Finally, we focused on
the study of the sensing response of the solid LB films to vapors
of ammonia and volatile amines. The importance of the aggregation
diminution and the presence of metal in the porphyrin will also be
discussed in terms of the relative spectral changes upon exposure
to an example analyte. The spectral changes of the optimized mixed
films containing the Zn derivative under exposure to the target analytes
are mapped into a color barcode-like images that are very useful not
only for an easy visualization of the sensing response but also for
its future implementation in sensor arrays.

Results And Discussion
Surface Pressure Area Isotherms
It is known that if
the porphyrin is embedded in a calixarene matrix, the interaction
between the porphyrin molecules is clearly reduced, thus improving
the non-aggregated organization at the interface.5,24,26,34,35 Here, we will study this effect in p-TCPP and its Zn-coordinated derivative. First, we have measured
the Langmuir isotherms of pure and mixed films. Typical isotherms
of an ideal amphiphile comprise a narrow molecular area range where
gas/expanded–liquid/condensed–liquid phase transitions
occur before a small diminution of the molecular area leads to the
collapse of the monolayers. Figure 2 shows the π–A isotherms
of pure p-TCPP and C8A films at the air/water interface
used as references to compare with the isotherms of p-TCPP mixed films represented on the same graph. In the case of p-TCPP (solid line), the limiting area is ∼43 Å2 per molecule, which is in close agreement with the literature.36 Considering that the molecular area of p-TCPP at a flat orientation is ∼230 Å2,37 the low limiting area obtained in
this work suggests that the macrocycles are tilted with respect to
the water surface and/or on a stacked aggregation as a consequence
of the interaction between the macrocycles at the interface, resulting
in low-quality films. These results for p-TCPP films
agree with the early self-aggregation observed in monolayers of other
porphyrins reported in previous works.25,26,38 In the case of C8A (dotted line), the extrapolated
area to 0 mN m–1 is ∼164 Å2. This extended area in dichloromethane is coincident with that published
elsewhere30 and is lower than that expected
for a flat orientation of the macrocycle with respect to the water
surface. In particular, calculated cross sections ranging from 140
to 322 Å2 were reported depending on the type of molecular
conformation and orientation. A pleated-loop conformation perpendicularly
oriented with respect to the interface was proposed in that study.

(black solid line), C8A (blue short dash line), p-TCPP/C8A-C (xp-TCPP = 0.6, black dot line; xp-TCPP = 0.8, back dash–dot line), and p-TCPP/C8A-S (xp-TCPP = 0.6, grey dash–dot–dot line) recorded at 20 °C.
Similarly, results for p-ZnTCPP (red dash line) and p-ZnTCPP/C8A-C (xp-TCPP = 0.6, red dash–dot line) are included.
The isotherms of mixed films are expressed per molecule.

For clarifying the effect of the calixarene in the mixed
films,
the isotherms are plotted in Figure 2 with respect to the total number of molecules. The
molecular areas of the mixed films (both for cospread p-TCPP/C8A-C and sequential p-TCPP/C8A-S films, see
the Experimental Section for details) fall
in between those of p-TCPP and C8A isotherms and
are closer to the molecular area than that of the major component.
The isotherm expansion increases with the porphyrin content. A first
insight into the miscibility of both components in the mixed films
can be withdrawn from its collapse pressure. As can be observed, the
collapse pressure for p-TCPP/C8A-C diminishes with
the porphyrin fraction, which is indicative of miscibility. For p-TCPP/C8A-S, however, the collapse occurs prematurely,
and it has been measured that the corresponding surface pressure is
irrespective of the porphyrin content. These latter results are indicative
of a segregation of the porphyrin among the calixarene matrix that
leads to a squeezing-out process at a high pressure that provokes
an untimely collapse of the films. The marked collapse in the p-TCPP/C8A-S films is observed even at the visual level.
In fact, when this mixed monolayer was being compressed, the appearance
of cohesion of different patches of C8A and p-TCPP
moieties could be directly checked. Further quantitative insight into
the important miscibility will be provided in the following.

The analysis of the behavior of mixed monolayers is generally undertaken
in terms of the fulfillment of the additivity rule, which establishes
that, in a binary immiscible mixture, the following expression is
obeyed at a fixed π value:3,39 1  where Ai and xi are the molecular area and molar fractions
of the component i, respectively, and A12 is the average molecular area in the mixture. The excess
area Aexc is defined for non-ideal monolayers
as follows: 2  

Since A12 is linear on xi as long as the molecules are immiscible or ideally
miscible, negative excess areas (or negative deviations of the additivity
rule) indicate that the interaction between C8A and p-TCPP is stronger than those between C8A/C8A and p-TCPP/p-TCPP giving rise to a special molecular
organization by the filling of the empty spaces or changes in the molecular packing as a
result of the interlocking of the different components.31 In other words, the mixing Gibbs free energy
ΔGmix = ∫0πAexcdπ is positive. The degree of fulfilling of this rule has been
assessed by using the experimental molecular areas of pure C8A and p-TCPP obtained at each pressure and plotted in Figure 2 as a function of
the molar fraction of p-TCPP.33

According to eq 1,
the expected area for an ideally immiscible p-TCPP/C8A
mixed monolayers at different surface pressures (0, 5, and 20 mN m–1) is calculated and plotted in Figure 3. As can be observed, the experimental molecular
areas A12 for p-TCPP/C8A-C
mixed monolayers are below the linear correlation defined by the ideal
behavior of immiscible films, while the values measured for p-TCPP/C8A-S mixed monolayers are close to the ideal linearity.
So, these experiments clearly indicate that the molecules of C8A and p-TCPP do not interact in the sequential spreading method.
Consequently, there is a phase separation with a molecular organization
controlled by the calixarene moieties. On the other hand, when the
two components are mixed by cospreading, the resulting film is, at
least, partly miscible.6 It should be remarked
that the negative deviation from the additivity rule is shorter as
the fraction of p-TCPP increases. In particular,
for xp-TCPP =
0.8, there are almost no deviation at any pressure, indicating that
the content of this component is so high that no miscibility occurs.
This effect occurs with other porphyrins found in the literature and
suggests that the molecular organization is controlled by the C8A
molecules.4,6 A similar behavior has been observed in
the p-ZnTCPP/C8A-C film with xp-TCPP = 0.6, whose differences between
the experimental and ideal areas are −53.7 ± 4.7, −11.5
± 2.3, and −1.8 ± 0.2 Å2 at 20, 5,
and 0 mN m–1, respectively. Hence, we have selected
the films with xp-TCPP = 0.6 for the rest of the experiments. These films are expected
to contain enough porphyrin amounts for an enhanced sensing behavior
without any premature collapse combined with a reasonable miscibility
between the components.

Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM)
Although the above
results seem to provide much information about the importance of C8A
in the mixed monolayers, the isotherms alone do not give definitive
information about the molecular organization. Therefore, it is necessary
to support these results by images of the film surface obtained by
BAM. This technique allows us to visualize directly the morphology
of the films during their formation at the air/water interface. Therefore,
changes in the molecular density, film thickness, or orientation inside
the film are monitored in the film reflectivity.4,5 Selected
BAM images of the pure C8A monolayer are shown in the right column
of Figure 4. It can
be noticed that after spreading (and before any compression), two
different regions can be observed: a large condensed domain, which
corresponds to higher density areas (bright region) that coexist with
a gas-phase region associated to the lowest-density areas of the monolayer
(darker regions). The difference of brightness is due to the differential
reflectivity associated with the thickness of these regions. Upon
compression, the condensed domains increasingly dominate the images,
while the gas phase gradually disappears. At higher pressures, the
film becomes a homogeneous and bright condensed phase. The bright
spots on solid domains are small mountain-shaped clusters of molecules
that are hard to keep in focus with the rest of the monolayer.38 These results agree with previous published
images of C8A monolayers.25,38

In the case of
pure p-TCPP shown in the left column of Figure 4, BAM images show
very similar features to those obtained for other porphyrins.40 When the porphyrin is spread on the surface
in this concentration regime, it tends to form big domains with irregular
edges and multiple bright points over a black surface that is associated
with the water subphase, indicating that just after spreading, the
molecules tend to form big aggregates and to self-associate in clusters,
leaving part of the surface uncovered (Figure 4a). As the monolayer is being compressed,
the big domains start to get closer. However, there still appear black
regions and bright spots, especially in the edges of the domains and
in the regions of cohesion. Finally, at high pressures, the film covers
the entire surface, but the bright points persist, showing a nonhomogeneous
surface unlike the case of the C8A monolayer. These results support
that the aggregation of p-TCPP at the interface occurs
as a result of the π–π interaction between the
macrocycles even before compression.40 BAM
images for the mixed monolayer of p-TCPP/C8A-S are
shown in the fourth column of Figure 4. After the deposition of the C8A solution and before
compression, the image is similar to that of the pure C8A monolayer
as expected (first image). After the spreading of the p-TCPP solution, the film breaks down, and some channels are opened
with a visible dark subphase. At high pressures, the homogeneity of
the first image is lost, showing the characteristic surface of the
pure p-TCPP film instead. These images suggest that
there is no miscibility between the components, and a surface formed
by different zones of pure C8A and p-TCPP monolayers
appears as a consequence of the segregation between the components.
It has also been checked that adding the C8A solution after p-TCPP (not shown) leads to similar images.

BAM images
of mixed p-TCPP/C8A-C (xp-TCPP = 0.6) films show a different
appearance as result of the spreading method (third column of Figure 3). At π = 0
mN m–1, the presence of C8A reduces the formation
of the clusters observed in the p-TCPP BAM images,
and, as the pressure is rising, light and dark regions appear uniformly
across the surface, and the black regions associated with the subphase
are not present. Although a certain degree of aggregation still appears,
the surface seems to be more homogeneous than p-TCPP/C8A-S
films. Thus, BAM images prove the higher homogeneity and miscibility
of the cospread mixed monolayers as it was previously interpreted
by the isotherms and the additivity rule. As can be seen in the second
column of Figure 4, the increment of the porphyrin content
in the mixed monolayer induced a decrease of the miscibility. Analogous
effects are observed for the p-ZnTCPP as shown in Figure S1. Further confirmation of this behavior
and additional details on the organization and association of the p-TCPP molecules at the interface as well as the influence
of the C8A molecules in the mixed monolayers can be obtained by measuring
the reflection spectrum during the compression.38

as evaluated by eq 1 and

interface under compression. The corresponding surface pressure and

Reflection Spectroscopy
at the Air/Water Interface
Direct evidence of the presence
of porphyrins and their aggregation
behavior at the interface is obtained here by reflection spectroscopy.
This technique detects only those chromophore molecules at the air/water
interface due to the reflection enhanced effect (ΔR) originated for the absorption and serves to infer the molecular
organization in the film. In this case, we have used the values of
the standardized reflection spectra, measured as ΔRs = ΔR/ΔRmax where ΔRmax is the
maximum ΔR value, although the original spectra
grow in all cases under compression as a consequence of the increasing
molecular density. Some representative spectra have been measured
in films of the two porphyrins (both in the absence and presence of
calixarene) for a surface pressure range spanning from high to low
molecular areas as shown in Figure 5. Also, the solution spectra are shown for comparison
(dotted line). The typical spectra of the porphyrins in solution consist
of an intense Soret band along with four associated weaker Q-bands.38 In general, there is a red shift and a widening
of the Soret band with respect to the solution where the porphyrin
molecules exist as monomers because of the presence of aggregates.
However, the spectra of the films of the two porphyrins in the absence
of calixarene (top plots in Figure 5) are clearly more aggregated when compared to the
corresponding mixed films (bottom plots in Figure 5). In particular, p-TCPP (Figure 5a) shows wider Soret bands with a shoulder at longer wavelengths,
while p-ZnTCPP exhibits the most shifted ones (Figure 5c).3,41 The bathochromic shift of the Soret band is ascribed to aggregates
of type J (in which the molecular planes are displaced
with respect to the stacking direction), while the increment of the
spectra width can be attributed to aggregates of a higher order. These
results clearly demonstrate the disaggregating effect of the calixarene
matrix in the mixed films whose corresponding spectra (Figure 5b,d) show a maximum of the
Soret band very near to that of the solution spectrum. On the other
hand, the shape of the Soret bands in the different films remains
in most cases approximately unaltered under compression, suggesting
that the proportion of the different species of aggregates remains
constant during this process in agreement with the self-aggregation
observed in the BAM results. The exception embodied by the p-ZnTCPP/C8A films, where a hypsochromic shoulder progressively
grows upon compression, could be indicative of the stacking of the
porphyrins in the form of H-aggregates (face-to-face
orientation). Since this aggregation occurs upon compression, and
in comparison with the behavior of the p-TCPP-containing
films, the presence of the calixarene effect on the porphyrin disaggregation
becomes more important in the p-ZnTCPP case. Regarding
orientation changes of the porphyrin molecules, further information
can be obtained by normalizing the original reflection spectra (see
the Experimental Section for details). Normalized
reflection spectra of p-TCPP and p-TCPP/C8A-C (xp-TCPP = 0.6) and
the metallic counterparts films under compression are represented
in Figure S2.

Figure 5 Standardized reflection
spectra of pristine and mixed porphyrin
films considered in this work. The surface areas (per porphyrin molecule)
and surface pressures of each spectrum are labeled in the figure.
The spectrum of the porphyrins in the solution is also included as
dotted lines. Images (a) and (b) stand for p-TCPP
and p-TCPP/C8A-C films, while images (c) and (d)
correspond to p-ZnTCPP and p-ZnTCPP/C8A-C
films, respectively. The molar fraction of the calixarene in the mixed
films is fixed at xp-TCPP = 0.8.

The values of the normalized reflection clearly
diminish in all
cases upon compression. Assuming that there is no loss of molecules
into the subphase, this diminution indicates that the porphyrin aggregates
are changing their orientation as the surface area is reduced, specifically
to a more tilted orientation. This effect is more pronounced in the p-ZnTCCP-C8A mixed films. All these observations together
with the narrower Soret band in the p-ZnTCPP/C8A
indicate that this films are the more disaggregated ones and hence
will be more adequate for sensing purposes. This point will be treated
in the next subsection.

UV–Vis Spectroscopy of Langmuir–Blodgett
Films
and Sensing Response
Figure 6a,d shows the UV–vis spectra of pristine LB
of the pure porphyrins and its mixture with C8A at xp-TCPP = 0.6. The spectra of the porphyrins in
the chloroform solution were also included as a reference (dotted
line), with a maximum absorbance for the Soret band at 420 and 429
nm for p-TCPP and p-ZnTCPP, respectively.
In comparison, the LB films of the pure and mixed porphyrin show the
maximum wavelengths of the Soret band at 424 nm for p-TCPP and p-TCPP/C8A, 437 nm for p-ZnTCPP and 431 nm for p-ZnTCPP/C8A. Again, the
spectra of the LB films are wider and red-shifted with respect to
the solution; a fact that suggests that the pre-aggregation that occurred
at the interface is maintained when the films are transferred onto
a glass substrate. In this sense, the influence of the C8A molecules
can be also observed from the results of the spectra of the LB films.
It can be observed that although the Soret band is also red-shifted
with respect to the solution, the peak is narrower, and its shape
is more similar to the monomeric form, suggesting that the aggregation
degree is smaller than in the pure LB film. A systematic influence
of the C8A is given in Figure S3. In that
figure, the wavelength difference of the Soret band of mixed films
with respect to the solution is measured as a function of the C8A
fraction for a number of calixarene molar fractions. The higher the
content in C8A is, the closer to the absorption wavelength of the
monomeric form will be. Moreover, it should be remarked that this
experiment was repeated several times, resulting in a low reproducibility
in the intensity of the unmixed porphyrin LB film spectra due to the
partially covered surface coming as a consequence of a bad deposition.
However, the mixed LB films covered the entire surface, and hence,
the spectra are much more reproducible.

spectra of p-TCPP:
solution (dotted line), LB film (dashed line), and mixed LB film (continuous

difference spectra for both p-TCPP LB films. Right

(d) UV–vis spectra of the p-ZnTCPP: solution

difference spectra for both p-ZnTCPP LB films. The
bottom image represents the color-encoded image of the response of
the LB toward butylamine. See text for details.

This diminution in the aggregation of the porphyrins in the presence
of a calixarene matrix has demonstrated to improve the optical sensitivity
towards analytes as a consequence of the higher accessibility of the
molecules to the active site of the porphyrin.3 Here, experiments exposing these LB films to butylamine vapors,
obtained by bubbling a dry N2 gas stream through the liquid
analyte at constant temperature, were carried out to assess the contribution
of the calixarene to the sensing activity of the porphyrins. The normalized
spectra of the four LB films (p-TCPP, p-ZnTCPP and their mixed counterparts) before and after the exposure
are shown in Figure 6b,e. Since aggregation in pure porphyrin films is known to be detrimental
for gas sensing,40 the spectral change
upon exposure in the mixed LB films is more prominent due to the disaggregating
effect of the calixarene molecules. In particular, the spectral changes
are more intense for the metallated porphyrin, in good agreement with
the reported sensitivity to amine vapors of porphyrins that are coordinated
with Zn.12,22,42,43 Moreover, the p-ZnTCPP spectrum
after exposure (black dashed line) shows a shift of less than 6 nm
with respect to the same film before exposure (black solid line),
while the wavelength of maximum absorbance of the p-ZnTCPP/C8A after exposure shows a red shift of 15.5 nm in comparison
with its UV–vis spectrum before exposure (red solid line).
This is indicative of the disaggregating effect of the calixarene
and the positive effect for gas sensing.

A more quantitative
determination of the difference of response
can be done by taking the squared difference spectra (Figure 6c,f) by subtracting the normalized
spectrum captured prior to any exposure from that measured after the
addition of the butylamine.44 The difference
spectrum of the p-ZnTCPP/C8A-C (xp-TCPP = 0.6) LB film shows the largest absorbance
change that becomes almost twice the response for the p-ZnTCPP film. This behavior is also observed for some other analytes
as will be discussed below. Moreover, the representation of these
changes in a color map, as explained in the Experimental
Section, gives rise to a clear recognition pattern (see the
image at the bottom of Figure 6) where these results are observed at a glance. Therefore,
we have selected these films (p-ZnTCPP/C8A) to study
its sensitivity and selectivity toward an ensemble of volatile amines
and ammonia vapors. The raw spectral results are presented in Figure S4 where the marked different response
of the films to each vapor is demonstrated. This method encloses this
information into a single recognition pattern that is found to be
characteristic of each analyte. Remarkably, in spite of the slight
difference in the unexposed spectra, the RMS of the results are within
5%. The complete set of results are shown in Figure 7 where it is clearly observed that butylamine
and 2-butylamine, even with relatively low vapor pressures of 10.9
and 18 kPa, respectively, are the analytes that produce the highest
values of change. The exposure to ammonia or tributylamine leads to
a comparatively lower response. These clear results indicate a selective
behavior of the LB films against volatile vapors. Future studies will
be focused on the analysis of the sensing capability of mixed LB films
including other TCPP derivatives, more analytes, and the kinetics
of the response and recovery after the gas exposure.

basic vapors. The color scale goes from red

pressures at room temperature (scaled to ammonia value) are written

Conclusions
The effect of embedding carboxyphenyl porphyrins
into a calixarene
matrix on the Langmuir and Langmuir–Blodgett films are explored
in both cospread and sequential spreading methods. It has been shown
that the calixarene promotes the disaggregation of the associated
structures of the carboxyphenyl porphyrins. In particular, the mixed
monolayers of p-TCPP/C8A and p-ZnTCPP/C8A
prepared by cospreading lead to more homogeneous films than those
obtained with the pure porphyrins. We found the best porphyrin/calixarene
proportion by exploring the specific intermolecular interactions and
the type of aggregation with the help of optical tools. In particular,
BAM imaging provides a direct visualization of the disaggregation
of the porphyrin in the presence of the calixarene because of the
subtle balance between subphase/porphyrin/calixarene interactions,
which is compositional-dependent. Further insight was obtained by
reflection spectroscopy. The aggregation was demonstrated to be mostly
of type J, and the disaggregated effect of the calixarene
is more important in the p-ZnTCPP case. Also, there
is higher reproducibility of the absorption spectra obtained for the
mixed LB films in comparison with those obtained with the pure porphyrins
films, indicating a better quality of the mixed monolayers. Hence,
the presence of the disaggregating macrocycle determines the subsequent
performance of the Langmuir–Blodgett films as gas sensors.
This performance is shown to be higher in the metallated porphyrin,
in agreement with some results published for some carboxyphenyl porphyrins,
and is strongly enhanced in the presence of the calixarene.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
The porphyrins 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin
and Zn(II)-5,10,15,20-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin were obtained
from Frontier Scientific. p-tert-butylcalyx[8]arene (C8A) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (HDMS)
were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. All macrocycle compounds were used
without further purification. Water was purified using a Millipore
Direct-Q system (18 MΩ cm).

Methods
Isotherms
were recorded in a NIMA 302LL Langmuir
trough equipped with two removable Teflon barriers with a total area
of 300 cm2. The temperature was kept at 294 ± 0.5
K with a thermostat enclosure. The absence of surface-active contaminants
was verified by compressing the bare water subphase, obtaining values
of surface pressure of less than 0.1 mN m–1. Films
were prepared by dropwise spreading of an appropriate volume of the
solutions of porphyrins and porphyrin/calixarene mixture over the
surface with a microsyringe. Specifically, the spreading solutions
of p-TCPP and p-ZnTCPP were prepared
by dissolving 1.5 mg of the porphyrin in 5 mL of a dichloromethane/methanol
(1:1) mixture. The solution of C8A was prepared by dissolving 1.5
mg of C8A in 5 mL of dichloromethane. The monolayers of pure compounds
were obtained by a dropwise deposition of the solutions with a microsyringe
(Hamilton, 250 μL) onto a clean water surface. The π–A isotherm of the mixed monolayers of p-TCPP/C8A were obtained at different C8A volume ratios following
two methods: (i) predissolving the components (cospreading, C) and
(ii) sequential spreading of the components onto the air/water interface
(S). In the latter, 10 min are left between the spreading
of the compounds to ensure the evaporation of the solvent of the first
deposited solution. After evaluating the miscibility of the porphyrin
in the calixarene matrix in the p-TCPP films (see
the Surface Pressure Area Isotherms section),
the mixed monolayers p-ZnTCPP were prepared only
by the cospreading method. Hereinafter, for instance, a mixed p-TCPP/C8A films prepared by the cospreading method will
be denoted as p-TCPP/C8A-C, and similarly, p-TCPP/C8A-S will represent the same film prepared with
the sequential spreading.

After spreading, the solvent was allowed
to evaporate for 15 min before measurement. The compression was started
using two symmetrically moving barriers with a barrier speed set to
15 cm2 min–1 (6.6, 6.5, 22, 8.2, and
8 Å2 per molecule and minute for p-TCPP, p-ZnTCPP, C8A, p-TCPP/C8A,
and p-ZnTCPP/C8A, respectively). The surface pressure
π is defined as π = γ0 – γ
where γ0 is the surface tension of the air/water
interface and γ is the surface tension in the presence of the
amphiphilic mixture. π was measured assuming a zero contact
angle with a dynamometric sensor of Wilhelmy-type with a 10 mm wide
strip of Whatmans’ Chr1 chromatography paper at the same time
as the molecular area A is evaluated. Measurements
were done in at least three independent samples in order to evaluate
the standard deviations.

Brewster angle microscopy was used
to obtain additional information
on the molecular organization of the monolayer at the air/water interface.
The images were obtained by using Nanofilm (now Accurion) BAM2plus
LE (lateral resolution: 2 μm). The image-processing software
allows the reduction of interference fringes and noise and improves
the contrast by scaling the brightness of the images.

Reflection
spectroscopy measurements were performed with an Accurion
RefSpec2 equipment with a spectral range of 220–1000 nm mounted
on a 702BAM Langmuir trough with a total area of 982 cm2. A sensor unit collimates the light to the sample surface and focuses
the reflected light into the fibers that guide it to the spectrometer.
A sample shutter is controlled via electronics holding a mirror that
reflects the light directly to the detector fiber. It serves as a
static reference to account for any lamp drift. The setup is completed
with a black plate located at the bottom of the Langmuir trough to
eliminate stray light (absorbing and reflecting transmitted light
out of the sensor). Details on the reflection spectrometer have been
described elsewhere.31,32 The difference of reflectivity,
ΔR, of the film-covered water surface is so-determined.
The reflection spectra were then normalized to the same surface density
of porphyrin by multiplying ΔR by the surface
area extracted from the π–A isotherms
(i.e., ΔRnorm = AΔR). As porphyrins are the chromophore molecule
in these set of experiments, the surface area is calculated per unit
of porphyrin molecule. A single spectrum measurement takes less than
4 s to be performed. In each experiment, a number of reflection spectra
were taken manually at different surface area values while the isotherms
were being recorded. A series of about 30 spectra were taken under
compression at surface areas ranging from gas to compressed-liquid
regions.

Hydrophobic glass slides of dimensions 26 × 10
mm2 immersed in HDMS for 24 h were washed with methanol
and heated to
110 °C in an oven. These slides where then used to support LB
films and were immersed into the subphase before the film spreading.
Films of p-TCPP, p-TCPP/C8A-C, p-TCPP/C8A-S, p-ZnTCPP, and p-ZnTCPP/C8A were compressed at 20 mN m–1 and stabilized
for 30 min once this target pressure is reached. Then, a controlled
dipper deposited 20 layers of Y-type by subsequent cycles of withdrawal
and immersion through the interface at a speed of 5 mm min–1 and 10 mm min–1 for pure porphyrin monolayers
and mixed monolayers, respectively. The numbers of layers is chosen
following the recommendations of ref3 for
similar compounds. Transfer ratios were found to lie in the 0.85–0.95
range for pure monolayers. Mixed films reached higher values close
to 1 in most cases.

A purpose-built gas testing chamber was
used to assess the gas-sensitivity
optical properties of the transferred Langmuir–Blodgett films.
The gas stream was directed into the gas chamber that held the samples.
A USB4000 Ocean Optics fiber spectrometer incorporating a Toshiba
3648-element linear CCD array detector was used to record the visible
absorption spectra of the sample over the wavelength range 350–850
nm. Data were collected in presence and absence of the volatile compound
at 293 K.26,33 Once the spectrum remains constant, UV–vis
absorption spectra were recorded using a less noisy Cary 100 UV–vis
spectrophotometer.

Finally, we have followed the procedure detailed
in ref22 with slight modifications to generate
an easy-to-read
color patterns set from the obtained spectra. For each kind of film
and analyte, the spectrum of the exposed film was subtracted from
the non-exposed one after normalization. The resulting difference
spectra were squared to avoid negative values and maximize the differences.
All the squared difference spectra for each analyte in the Soret band
region were put together and converted into an m × n matrix where m is the wavelength and n is the number of spectra used (one per analyte or one
per porphyrin). The matrix was then represented as a color image using
Origin 2015 software. For each type of film, the resulting image colors
range from red (for points with null squared difference absorbance)
to blue (maximum change points).
