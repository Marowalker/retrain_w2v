In this paper, the controlled production
of high-quality metal-free
diamond nanoparticles is demonstrated. Milling with tempered steel
is shown to leave behind iron oxide contamination which is difficult
to remove. Milling with SiN alleviates this issue but generates more
nondiamond carbon. Thus, the choice of milling materials is critically
determined by the acceptable contaminants in the ultimate application.
The removal of metal impurities, present in all commercially available
nanoparticles, will open new possibilities toward the production of
customized diamond nanoparticles, covering the most demanding quantum
applications.

Introduction
Diamond nanoparticles
have been highlighted as an important material
for a wide range of applications. Because of biocompatibility1,2 and noncytotoxicity3 of diamond, diamond
nanoparticles have been used in biomedical applications such as optical
bio-imaging4 or drug delivery.5,6 Diamond nanoparticles are also used as nucleation centers for synthetic
diamond growth,7 with potential application
for nano-electro-mechanical systems8,9 or quantum
devices such as superconducting quantum interference devices.10 Another important application is the use of
diamond nanoparticles as single-photon sources.11 Defects present in the diamond lattice or defects intentionally
created (known as color centers) can act as single-photon emitters.12 For instance, because of its room-temperature
high photostability and narrow emission in the zero phonon line, SiV– is a good candidate for quantum computing and quantum
cryptography applications.13 Another well-known
color center, NV–, is interesting due to its spin
properties.14−19 Spin manipulation possibilities make this color center attractive
as a magnetic field sensor and for magnetic imaging.20 Furthermore, recent studies in levitated diamond nanoparticles
containing the NV– center have been proposed to
detect quantum superposition states21,22 and as a method
to detect quantum gravity.23,24

Although a variety
of commercial nanoparticles are available, increasingly
demanding applications require the use of high-quality contaminant-free
diamond nanoparticles. Nondiamond carbon (sp2) is commonly
present in commercial diamond nanoparticles. The presence of such
carbon on diamond surfaces leads to particle aggregation,25 and reactive sp2 species are detrimental
for biological applications. Additionally, commercial nanodiamonds
typically have a high concentration of nitrogen defects [N] > 100
ppm, which reduces NV– spin coherence times and
hence magnetic field sensitivity.26 This
high nitrogen content is also a problem for the levitation of diamond
nanoparticles in high vacuum as the nitrogen absorbs the trapping
laser light, heating and burning the diamond nanoparticles.27,28 Furthermore, a non-negligible amount of metal contaminants29,30 is also present in commercially available nanoparticles, reducing
the possibilities of the magnetic-related applications. Inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry studies performed by Volkov et al.29 over 20 different commercial detonation diamond
particles detected high amounts of metal impurities in all of them.

For these reasons, it is highly important to be able to create
customized diamond particles. Several methods for particles’
production are known up to date. The most versatile one is the production
of diamond nanoparticles by crushing chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
diamond or bulk diamond using milling techniques.31,32 This approach enables particle size distribution control and offers
the possibility of creating custom color centers as well as particles
from bulk diamond with low nitrogen concentration. Nevertheless, deep
cleaning methods are required after the milling process.

In
this paper, the production of metal-free particles from commercial
single-crystal (SC) bulk diamond is shown. Different milling materials
are compared.

Experimental Methods
Commercial
CVD grown SC diamond samples, 0.3 mm thick (2.6 mm ×
2.6 mm sized) sourced from Element Six, were used in this study. Two
different grinding bowls, one made from tempered steel and one made
from silicon nitride, were used for crushing the SC plates. Twelve
SC plates (95 mg approximately) were introduced in each grinding bowl
with 5 mL of deionized (DI) water and 40 and 30 g of tempered steel
and silicon nitride grinding balls (d = 3 mm), respectively.
Samples were milled in the Planetary Micro Mill PULVERISETTE 7, following
6 cycles of 5 min on/15 min off at 1100 rpm (∼95 g). After
the milling process, the samples were cooled down and taken out of
the grinding bowls and several acid cleaning processes were performed.
For iron removal, the cleaning was performed as described by Heyer
et al.32 For the silicon nitride cleaning,
20 mL of sample was mixed with 30 mL of orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4) and the mixture was stirred continuously in
a condenser during 24 h at 180 °C bath temperature. To remove
the acids, both solutions underwent repeated washing and centrifugation
cycles at 30 000g, removing the supernatant
after each centrifugation process and adding DI water to the pellet
until the pH reached a value between 5.8 and 6.0. The slurries were
dried in a hot plate to obtain the powders. For the silicon nitride
grinding process, the obtained powder was introduced again in the
condenser after being dissolved in 20 mL of water, and 30 mL of concentrated
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was added. The mixture was stirred
in the condenser during 24 h at 150 °C. The washing and centrifugation
cycles were repeated as previously described until pH 5.8–6
was reached. After the cleaning and centrifugation cycles, the tempered
steel-milled and the silicon nitride-milled powders were treated in
a furnace under air atmosphere at 600 °C for 5 h. Different aqueous
colloids were prepared from the treated powders by dispersing 0.01
g of powder in 20 mL of DI water. The colloids were dispersed via
ultrasound, and the solutions were centrifuged at different accelerative
forces (5000g, 10 000g, 20 000g, and 30 000g) at 10 °C in
a Sigma 3-30 KS centrifuge. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA) measurements were performed to measure the
particles’ size distribution. The Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS
used in our experiments was equipped with a 633 nm laser in backscattering
configuration (173°) and the Malvern NanoSight LM10 was equipped
with a 635 nm laser.

Raman measurements were recorded in an
inVia Renishaw confocal
Raman microscope equipped with a 532 nm laser. All the measurements
were acquired using the same parameters: 10 s acquisition time and
50 accumulations.

For comparison of the surface chemistry of
each powder, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed in a Thermo Scientific
K-Alpha+ spectrometer. Spectra were acquired using a monochromatic
Al source operating at 72 W (6 mA emission current × 12 kV anode
potential). A survey and a high-resolution spectrum were acquired
at pass energies of 150 and 40 eV, respectively. Charge neutralization
was achieved using the K-Alpha charge neutralization system, employing
a combination of both electrons and low energy argon ions. All XPS
spectra were calibrated with the carbon C 1s peak at 285 eV.

Results
and Discussion
XPS measurements were taken in various steps.
(1) On pristine SC
substrate, (2) after tempered steel milling, (3) after tempered steel
milling followed by acid cleaning, and (4) after the silicon nitride
milling followed by its corresponding acid cleaning treatment (see Experimental Methods). Figure 1 shows the XPS survey for the mentioned processes
with all the detectable elements present in the samples.

just before the milling, (b) powder after milling using tempered steel
grinding bowl, (c) powder after the tempered steel milling and the
acid cleaning to remove the metal contaminants, and (d) powder after
the silicon nitride milling.

Figure 1a
shows
the XPS spectrum of the as-received SC substrate. The XPS spectrum
shows two clear peaks corresponding to carbon (C 1s peak) and oxygen
(O 1s peak) elements at 285 and 531.8 eV, respectively. A small third
peak (Si 2p) also appears at lower binding energies. No silicon should
be present in the sample, and so the sample was subjected to argon
cluster cleaning. The complete removal of the silicon after the cluster
cleaning indicates some kind of surface contamination. (see Figure S1). The survey XPS spectrum in Figure 1b corresponds to
the sample milled with the tempered steel milling bowl and balls.
The spectrum shows four elements: carbon (C 1s), oxygen (O 1s), iron
(Fe 2p), and silicon (Si 2p). The Fe 2p peak confirms the presence
of iron in the sample produced in the milling process. Although acid
cleaning was performed in order to remove all the metallic components,
non-negligible amounts of iron were detected (XPS detection limit
is 10 ppm) after the acid cleaning, as shown in Figure 1c. The Si 2p peak presence can be neglected
as this silicon is due to contamination present previous to the milling
process and can be removed with argon cluster etching inside the XPS
chamber.

C 1s, O 1s, Si 2p, N 1s, and Na 1s peaks are present
in the SC
sample milled with silicon nitride (shown in Figure 1d).

In this case, the Si 2p and N 1s
peaks are related to silicon and
nitrogen contamination because of insufficient cleaning of the silicon
nitride produced in the milling. The Na 1s peak is due to sodium contamination
in the cleaning process, as NaOH was used in the cleaning. Different
cleaning methods for Si3N4 removal can be found
in the literature. Kim et al.33 proposed
Si3N4 dissolution utilizing an HF, H2SO4, and HNO3 mixture. Nevertheless, although
Si3N4 was not completely removed, iron (Fe 2p
peak) was not detected in the sample milling with silicon nitride,
making the use of a silicon nitride grinding bowl extremely important
in magnetometry applications.

The atomic percentages of the
different elements present in the
samples can be calculated from the survey spectrum, after the normalization
of the peak areas considering the appropriate sensitivity factors
(see Table S1).34 A drastic increase in the O 1s/C 1s ratio is observed after the
milling processes because the samples are subjected to an air annealing
(oxidation) treatment after the respective acids cleaning treatments.
Further increase in the O 1s/C 1s ratio was obtained for the SC sample
milled with the silicon nitride.

To obtain further information
about the elements present in the
samples, high-resolution scans were performed in the region of interest.
The data were fitted using Gaussian fits in CasaXPS, after subtraction
of a Shirley type background.

All the peaks present in the XPS
survey were analyzed in detail
(Figures S2–S4), but only the carbon
and the iron spectra are discussed in this paper. In Figure 2, high-resolution scans for
the C 1s and the iron Fe 2p peaks of the different samples are shown.
The fitting of the C 1s peak shows different components with small
binding energy (BE) shifts between them. However, there is no consensus
in the literature to assign each BE to a component, as different BE
values have been reported for the same chemical species.35−38 BE shifts of −1, +1, +2.5, and +4 eV were taken from the
literature39 and assigned to graphitic
carbon, hydroxyl (C–OH)/ether (C–O–C), carbonyl
(C=O), and carboxyl groups (COOH). An additional shift of −3
eV was considered for the silicon nitride-milled sample, corresponding
to Si–C bonds.40,41

Figure 2 High-resolution XPS scans for the carbon
and iron elements. (a)
Carbon (C 1s) deconvoluted peak for the as-received SC, and the powders
after been milled with the tempered steel and the silicon nitride
grinding bowls, respectively. (b) Iron (Fe 2p) peak for the SC samples
milled in a tempered steel grinding bowl and (c) Fe 2p peak of the
SC sample milled in the silicon nitride grinding bowl.

The C 1s peak for the SC sample before any milling
process shows
a symmetric spectrum with a dominant peak at 285 eV, attributed to
the C–C bond (sp3 bonded carbon). In the same graph,
small contributions attributed to both C=C bonds and C=O
bonds were also observed at lower and higher binding energies, respectively.
The SC diamond sample milled with tempered steel presents, however,
a slightly asymmetric peak consisting of four Gaussian peaks, centered
at 284, 285, 286, and 287.5 eV. The first peak can be assigned to
sp2 carbon (C=C). The peak at 285 eV corresponds
to sp3 bonded carbon, the peak at 286 eV is attributed
to −C–H/C–O bonds, and the peak at 287.5 eV is
assigned to the C=O bonds.42

The SC sample after the silicon nitride milling presents, in contrast,
an asymmetric peak with a tail toward higher binding energies, which
indicates a higher sp2 carbon concentration. Apart from
the peaks described for the tempered steel sample, two more peaks
are clearly observed.

The peak at the lowest energy, 283 eV,
confirms the presence of
carbon bonded to silicon, and the peak at 289 eV can be assigned to
carboxyl groups (COOH) or to the π–π* transition.43,44

The differences between the three samples are more pronounced
representing
the percentage of the relative contents as shown in Figure 3. The sample before the milling
process subjected to the cluster argon ion cleaning has also been
included for comparison.

Figure 3 Bar plot with the percentages of the relative
contents of the C
1s peak for the different samples.

A reduction in the sp3 (C–C) content is
clearly
observed between the as-received sample, the as-received sample subjected
to an argon cluster cleaning (85.6%), and the sample milled with the
silicon nitride material (65.8%). In the latter sample, the appearance
of the COOH and C–Si components is evident.

Clear differences
in the fitting of the C 1s peak are observed,
showing further graphitization produced with the silicon nitride milling.

Whereas the study of the C 1s peak can provide information about
the surface graphitization (sp2 content), the analysis
of the Fe 2p peak will confirm the presence of undesired metal impurities.
Iron was detected in the survey spectra of the SC diamond sample milled
with the tempered steel. A high-resolution scan for the Fe 2p peak
is shown in Figure 2b. The BE of the Fe 2p3/2 peak was observed at 711.2 eV,
which corresponds to the core level spectra of Fe3+ ions.45 Although iron was not detected in the SC sample
milled with the silicon nitride, a more detailed scan for the Fe 2p
peak was also performed for this sample for comparison. Figure 2c shows the XPS measurement
of this peak in which iron was not detected.

Even though silicon
nitride milling is the best method to avoid
any metal content in the diamond particles produced, it also has some
drawbacks. The silicon nitride material generated in the milling process
is difficult to remove. Also, the asymmetry in the C 1s peak confirms
higher surface graphitization of the particles when compared to the
tempered steel-milled sample. The sp2 carbon, either in
the form of graphitic-like carbon or amorphous carbon, is detrimental
for many applications. Attempts to remove the sp2 carbon
by conducting an air annealing treatment46 at 600 °C did not result in the complete removal of sp2 carbon.

To confirm the quality of the diamond powders
obtained after crushing
the SC plates, Raman measurements were performed on the samples.

Figure 4 shows the
Raman measurements for the different SC powders. A sharp and clear
diamond peak centered at 1332 cm–1 can be observed
in the samples milled with both tempered steel (Figure 4a) and silicon nitride (Figure 4b). Furthermore, a small band
between 1500 and 1600 cm–1, known as the G-band,
can be distinguished in the sample milled with the silicon nitride
(Figure 4b), confirming
the presence of sp2 sites.47

and air annealing processes. (a) SC powder after tempered steel milling
process and (b) SC powder after the silicon nitride milling process.

The possibility of selecting and
controlling the particles’
size, highly important for different applications, represents an enormous
advantage over commercial nanoparticles. Particles with sizes below
70 nm are desired for quantum applications, with particles as small
as 10 nm containing active NV centers.48 Furthermore, particles with sizes between 50 and 100 nm are also
suitable for drug delivery bio-applications.49 Particle size distributions can be controlled by combining longer
milling times and colloids centrifugation at higher accelerative forces. Figure 5 shows the particle
size distributions in the colloids made from tempered steel-milled
particles as described in the experimental section. Two different
characterization methods, DLS and NTA, as well as different accelerative
forces to select particle size distributions were used.

Figure 5 Particles’
size distribution of the tempered steel-milled
powders’ solution after centrifugation at different accelerative
forces: (a) 5000g; (b) 10 000g; (c) 20 000g; and (d) 30 000g.

In polydispersed colloids,
it is important to use various characterization
methods. For instance, in DLS, the presence of particles with various
sizes can lead to imprecise particle size distributions. This is due
to the fact that in DLS, the particle size is determined from intensity
fluctuations in the Rayleigh scattering off a volume of the particles.
As the intensity of Rayleigh scattering is proportional to d6, where d is the particle
diameter, large particles or aggregates can mask the measurement of
smaller particles. On the other hand, NTA gives a more precise measure
as individual particles can be tracked. Figure 5a shows the distribution of particles after
centrifugation at 5000g. In the NTA analysis graph,
two different particle size distribution peaks can be differentiated,
118 and 156 nm, whereas the particle size distribution is broader
for the DLS measurement. This difference increases with increasing
centrifuge accelerative force as seen in Figure 5b–d. Three particle size distributions
were distinguished at 10 000g (Figure 5b), 29, 82, and 122 nm, but
in the DLS measurement a mean value of 122 nm was obtained. Centrifugation
at higher revolutions per minute results in smaller fractions of particles
with large diameters, and particle size distribution down to 53 nm
was recorded after centrifugation at 30 000g.

Conclusions
In summary, diamond nanoparticles with controlled
sizes have been
produced following two distinct milling strategies. High-quality starting
material and the choice of the grinding bowl material will ultimately
determine the subsequent potential applications.

Milling with
the tempered steel material results in Fe2O3 presence in the diamond nanoparticles even after the
acid cleaning process, which excludes their use in magnetic/spin-related
applications. Silicon nitride milling is a good choice to ensure metal-free
diamond nanoparticles, but results in larger nondiamond contamination,
difficult to remove. Although the silicon nitride milled process showed
the presence of sodium, the hydroxide cleaning process can be discarded
in favor of producing metal-free nanoparticles.
