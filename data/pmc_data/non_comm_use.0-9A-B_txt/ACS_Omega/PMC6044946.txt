A pH and thermal dual-responsive
nanocarrier with silica as the
core and block copolymer composed of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA)
and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) as the shell
was prepared by surface-initiated reversible addition–fragmentation
chain-transfer (SI-RAFT) polymerization. The resulting SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM particles dispersed individually
in an aqueous solution at a high pH and a low temperature but reversibly
agglomerated under acidic conditions or at elevated temperatures.
These dual-responsive nanoparticles were used as carriers to deliver
the model drug doxorubicin (DOX) with unusually high entrapment efficiency
and loading content, which is due to the small size (15 nm), light
weight of the cores, and high graft density (0.619 chains/nm2) achieved by SI-RAFT polymerization. The release rate was controlled
by both the pH and temperature of the surrounding medium. Moreover,
these particles selectively precipitated at acidic conditions with
increased temperature, which may enhance their ability to accumulate
at tumor sites. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that DOX-loaded
nanoparticles are highly active against Hela cells and more effective
than free DOX of an equivalent dose. A cellular uptake study revealed
that SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles
could successfully deliver DOX molecules into the nuclei of Hela cells.
All these features indicated that SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles are a promising candidate for therapeutic applications.

Introduction
Polymer-grafted nanoparticles
have gained significant attention
because of their wide application in materials science, bioimaging,
and drug delivery.1−5 The surface-initiated reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer
(SI-RAFT) polymerization technique has been developed as a robust
method to graft polymers from silica surfaces with a predetermined
density and controlled molecular weights.6−8 A variety of
polymers with well-defined architectures (homopolymer, block copolymer,
bimodal brushes) have been successfully grafted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method.9−12 Stimuli-responsive polymers are materials that can
adapt to environmental changes like pH, temperature, ionic strength,
and light.13−18 Poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) are typical stimuli-responsive polymers that have been widely
studied. PMAA chains change conformation in water in response to pH
changes. Under basic conditions, the carboxylic groups along the polymer
chains are deprotonated, creating charges that make the polymer swell
in water. At low pH (<5), carboxylic groups are protonated, making
the chains hydrophobic and adapt a collapsed conformation.19,20 Comparatively, PNIPAM chains can perform similar conformational
transformations in response to temperature. Below the lower critical
solution temperature (LCST), PNIPAM chains stretch out and swell in
aqueous solution. A phase transition occurs at temperatures above
LCST, when the chains become hydrophobic and collapse into a condensed
conformation.21

Grafting stimuli-responsive
polymers onto inorganic nanoparticles
is an interesting topic because the combined assembly could exhibit
properties inherent in both the inorganic cores and grafted polymers.
A common application of these core–shell structures is the
controlled delivery of active species into biological targets. For
example, Ma et al. prepared magnetic colloid nanocrystal clusters
covered with cross-linked poly(acrylic acid) that conjugated doxorubicin
(DOX) and released them upon reduction in pH,22 and Xu et al. synthesized multifunctional carriers with silicon
as the core and a biocompatible block copolymer as the shell. The
release rate was found to be regulated by both the pH and chain length
of the outer block.23 However, the drug-loading
(DL) contents and entrapment efficiency (EE) were relatively low compared
to those of pure polymer systems presumably because of the high weight
content of the cores and low graft density of polymers achieved by
the “grafting to” process.

Our group has reported
SI-RAFT polymerization of methacrylic acid
(MAA) from 15 nm silica nanoparticles.19,24 This direct
“grafting from” strategy offers a convenient way to
achieve high graft densities and subsequently a high polymer content.
On the basis of this work, a rationally designed core–shell
drug delivery system is described using 15 nm silica nanoparticles
as cores and PMAA-b-PNIPAM block copolymer as shells.
PMAA, as the inner block, was used to conjugate with drug molecules
through electrostatic attraction forces. The PNIPAM outer block not
only introduced temperature responsiveness, but also helped to prevent
premature drug leaking. These nanocarriers exhibited unusually high
EE and loading content (LC) when using DOX as a model drug. The drug
release rate was found to be affected by both pH and temperature.
Specifically, the release rate was enhanced at acidic pH and high
temperature, which is the typical environment of tumor cells.21 It is also worth noting that these nanoparticles
are well dispersed at low temperatures but self-assembled into clusters
and eventually precipitated at elevated temperatures, which may enhance
their ability to accumulate around tumor cells.

Experimental Section
Materials
All chemicals were obtained from Acros or
Fisher and used as received unless otherwise specified. N-Isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) was obtained from TCI and recrystallized
twice from hexane to remove inhibitor. MAA was purified by passing
through an activated neutral alumina column. AIBN was recrystallized
from methanol and dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution at
a concentration of 10 mmol/L.

Instrumentation
1H NMR (Bruker ARX 300/ARX
400) spectroscopy was conducted using CD3OD as the solvent.
Molecular weights and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined using
a gel permeation chromatography with a 515 HPLC pump, a 2410 refractive
index detector, and three Styragel columns. The columns consist of
HR1, HR3, and HR4 in the effective molecular weight ranges of 100–5000,
500–30 000, and 5000–500 000, respectively.
THF was used as an eluent at 30 °C, and the flow rate was adjusted
to 1.0 mL/min. Molecular weights were calibrated with poly(methyl
methacrylate) standards obtained from Polymer Laboratories. DLS characterizations
were conducted using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 from Malvern. Infrared
spectra were obtained using a BioRad Excalibur FTS3000 spectrometer.
Optical spectroscopy was conducted by measuring the transmittance
at 300 nm using a PerkinElmer Lambda 4C UV–vis spectrometer.

SI-RAFT Polymerization of MAA from 4-Cyanopentanoic Acid Dithiobenzoate
(CPDB)-Anchored Silica Nanoparticles
CPDB-anchored 15 nm
silica nanoparticles were prepared according to the literature.1 For a typical reaction, 400 mg of CPDB-anchored
silica nanoparticles (0.619 chains/nm2, 146.7 μmol/g),
5.05 g of MAA (58.7 mmol), and 400 mg of trioxane were mixed in 12
mL of DMF and subjected to sonication for 2 min. AIBN solution (1.17
mL, 10 mmol/L) in DMF was then added. The above mixture was transferred
to a Schlenk tube and degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles, backfilled with nitrogen, and placed in an oil bath of 65
°C for 2.5 h. The polymerization was stopped by quenching in
an ice bath. The resulting solution was washed twice with diethyl
ether to remove monomers and initiator, and the PMAA-grafted particles
were redispersed in 20 mL of DMF for subsequent reaction.

SI-RAFT Polymerization
of PNIPAM-b-PMAA from
Surface-Anchored Macroinitiator
A 10 mL solution of PMAA-grafted
silica nanoparticles with an active RAFT agent chain end was mixed
with 3.22 g of NIPAM monomer, 0.58 mL of 1 mmol/L AIBN solution, and
500 mg of trioxane. The above mixture was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles and placed in an oil bath of 80 °C for 12 h. The polymerization
was stopped by quenching in an ice bath.

Preparation of DOX-Loaded
SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM Particles
A typical process to load DOX onto SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM particles is described as
follows: 12 mL of 1 mg/mL DOX solution was added into a solution of
40 mg particles, and the mixture was stirred overnight under dark
conditions. The DOX-loaded particles were recovered by ultracentrifugation
at 20 000 rpm and 40 °C for 1 h and washed twice by deionized
(DI) water to remove free DOX. All supernatant was collected and subjected
to UV–vis analysis to determine the drug encapsulation efficiency
(EE) and DL contents. A calibration curve of DOX in water was made
as the reference. EE and DL were determined using the equations    

In Vitro Drug Release from DOX @ SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM
Nanoparticles loaded with DOX were redispersed
in 16 mL of DI water. The dispersion was then transferred into dialysis
bags. The bags were subsequently placed in beakers of different solutions
(pH 5.0 sodium acetic acid buffer or pH 7.0 phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) buffer) at different temperatures (25 or 40 °C). Each solution
(2 mL) was sampled at certain periods of time and analysis using a
UV–vis spectrometer was conducted to determine the amount of
released DOX. All drug release data were averages of three measurements.

Cell Culture
Hela cells were obtained from ATCC. They
were grown on standard tissue culture plastic in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. The cell culture medium was
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics.

Cell Viability
Assay
Biocompatibilities of SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles, free DOX, and
DOX-loaded nanoparticles were tested on Hela cells, and cell viability
was determined by CellTiter-Blue assay. Briefly, cells were seeded
on a 96-well plate at a density of 1.0 × 104 cell/well
and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then,
the cell culture medium was replaced with 100 μL of a fresh
medium containing various concentrations of testing samples. After
24 h of incubation, the testing samples were removed and 10% CellTiter-Blue
Reagent was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. The fluorescence
was recorded on a Spectramax Gemini EM spectrophotometer with excitation
and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively.

Cellular Uptake
Study
Cells were seeded on a 12-well
plate with a glass cover slip at the bottom of each well (5 ×
104 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. The medium was replaced with free DOX and DOX-loaded
nanoparticles (2 μg/mL of DOX) for another 4 h incubation. The
cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde
for 20 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS,
the cells were stained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for
10 min and kept in PBS. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize
and record images.

Results and Discussion
The strategy
for the preparation of PNIPAM-b-PMAA-grafted
silica nanoparticles is shown in Scheme 1. Two separate SI-RAFT polymerizations were
conducted sequentially to build well-defined diblock copolymers onto
15 nm silica nanoparticle surfaces. The polymerization of the first
block was conducted employing a ratio among species of [MAA]/[RAFT]/[AIBN]
= 1000:1:0.1 at 65 °C. The monomer conversion, followed by 1H NMR, was found to be 18.5% after 2.5 h, indicating 185 repeat
units of each PMAA chain on average (Figure S1). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the grafted polymer
accounted for about 70 wt % of the nanoparticles. The PMAA-grafted
nanoparticles were washed several times by diethyl ether to remove
excess monomer and initiator. The polymerization of the second block
was conducted using NIPAM as monomer with a ratio among species [NIPAM]/[RAFT]/[AIBN]
= 1000:1:0.1 in DMF at 65 °C. The reaction was followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy to calculate the conversion (Figure S2). The final product was characterized
to be SiO2-PMAA185-b-PNIPAM573, where the subscripts represent the number of repeat units.
TGA showed that the total polymer content was ∼90% (Figure 1A). Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (Figure 1B) of the nanoparticles confirmed the existence of a block
copolymer. The presence of a broad peak at ∼3400 cm–1 ascribed to hydroxyl groups and the strong absorption at ∼1700
cm–1 corresponding to C=O double bonds confirmed
the successful attachment of the PMAA chains. An additional peak at
∼1546 cm–1 appeared after the second polymerization,
which is reported to be a characteristic of N–H stretching,25 confirmed the attachment of the PNIPAM block.

TEM and DLS Studies
Both of the PMAA-grafted and PMAA-b-PNIAPM-grafted silica nanoparticles could be readily dispersed
in water at neutral pH and room temperature. The individual nature
of the nanoparticles was confirmed using TEM, as shown in Figure 1C. The hydrodynamic
diameter of the particles was measured by DLS (Figure 1D). PMAA-SiO2 particles had a Z-average diameter of 79.99 nm with a narrow PDI of 0.168,
indicating that the particles were uniform in size. The SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM particles were found to have a Z-average diameter of 122.9 nm, ∼43 nm larger than
SiO2-PMAA particles, which further confirmed the successful
attachment of the second block.

Double Stimuli-Responsive
Properties of SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM
The as-prepared SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles
in aqueous solution responded to
both pH and temperature as expected. Initial mixing between the dried
nanoparticles and DI water resulted in a slightly turbid solution,
which cleared up immediately after addition of a small amount of a
base to break the interpolymer hydrogen bonding.26,27 Acid (1 equiv) was then added to adjust the pH back to neutral,
and no aggregation occurred during the process. The turbidity change
during the process was measured by UV–vis at 300 nm, as shown
in Figure 2.

SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM solution. (C) Transmittance
change at 300 nm with increasing temperature of a SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM solution at pH 7.

The thermal responsive behavior of the SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM particles was investigated using both optical spectroscopy
and DLS. A transparent solution of particles dispersed in water at
pH 7 was heated from room temperature to 57 °C. As shown in Figure 2C, the transmittance
decreased dramatically at 32 °C, corresponding to the LCST of
PNIPAM, indicating the formation of aggregates due to decreased solubility
of the PNIPAM corona. The aggregation of particles with increasing
temperature was also monitored using DLS. At room temperature, only
one sharp peak was found corresponding to monodispersed particles.
When the temperature was increased above 32 °C, a second peak
centered at approximately 600 nm appeared, which represented the formation
of aggregates (Figure S3).

In Vitro Drug
Release of DOX
DOX is a widely studied
model drug that conjugates well with negatively charged polymers via
electrostatic interactions.22 At neutral
pH, DOX molecules, with pKa 8.6, are positively
charged, which leads to a strong interaction with negatively charged
PMAA polymer chains. The LC and EE of DOX in SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM were calculated to be 21.2 and 89.8%, respectively,
when the weight percent of initial DOX feeding was 30% (Table 1).28 Compared to those of other core–shell type drug carriers,29−32 the ones prepared in this work showed significantly higher EE and
LC. At least two factors contributed to this unusually high amount
of DOX loading. First, high polymer content was achieved because of
the small size of the cores and high graft density. TGA results showed
that 90 wt % of the nanoparticles was polymer, whereas the silica
cores accounted for only 10 wt %. Second, once DOX was loaded onto
the PMAA chains, the outer PNIPAM layer will act as a shield to prevent
the loaded drug from escaping. An even higher LC could be achieved
with 50, 75, and 100% feed ratios (Table 1). The in vitro DOX release profile from
SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM particles (3:10 feed
ratio) under different conditions is shown in Figure 3. The release performance was studied at
both physiological pH (7.4) and lysosomal pH (5.0) conditions at temperatures
of 25 and 40 °C. The release profiles revealed that release rates
depended on both pH and temperature. Only limited amounts of loaded
DOX were released at pH 7, regardless of temperature; however, under
acidic conditions, significant amounts of DOX could be released during
the same period of time.33 Approximately
50% of the loaded drugs were released at pH 5 and 25 °C, whereas
more than 80% were released at pH 5 and 40 °C. The best release
result was obtained under conditions of acidic pH and elevated temperature,
which is the typical environment for cancer cells. The mechanism behind
the differences in release rates is depicted in Scheme 2. The electrostatic attraction between negatively
charged polymer and positively charge DOX prevented significant release
at neutral pH. However, under acidic conditions, protonation of the
carboxylic acid groups of PMAA weakened the electrostatic interaction,
enhancing DOX release. The release rate was further boosted by increasing
temperature above the LCST, which collapsed the PNIPAM chains and
caused the nanoparticles to agglomerate. The agglomeration process
greatly reduced interparticle spacing and squeezed out DOX at a higher
rate. This temperature-controlled agglomeration behavior also allowed
particles to circulate without a significant drug loss but precipitate
and concentrate at places at elevated temperatures. It is worth noting
that the slight decrease of DOX after 30 h for pH 7 and 40 °C
was because of the thermal degradation of DOX at elevated temperature.34

Cell Viability Assay
In vitro cytotoxicity of SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles, DOX-loaded
SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles, and
free DOX were studied on Hela cells by a CellTiter-Blue assay. Figure 4 shows the cytotoxicity
profile of Hela cells incubated with various concentrations of SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles. These control
nanoparticles showed no significant toxic effects up to 200 μg/mL.
In contrast, DOX-loaded nanoparticles caused significant death of
Hela cells at low concentration. Moreover, DOX-loaded nanoparticles
exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect than free DOX of the same dose
at low concentration. This difference in drug efficiency is most pronounced
in the range of 5–10 μg/mL, where DOX-loaded nanoparticles
resulted in 47% less cell viability for Hela cells compared to free
DOX. This enhanced drug efficiency may be caused by the locally high
concentration effect.35

concentrations of (A) SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM
nanoparticles and (B) free DOX and DOX-loaded SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles.

Cell Uptake
Hela cells were incubated with free DOX
and DOX-loaded nanoparticles at 37 °C. Figure 5 shows that after 4 h, red fluorescence was
observed around the nuclei of Hela cells in both cases, indicating
that the SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles
are capable of internalizing into the nuclei of cancer cells.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated the successful
attachment of PMAA-b-PNIPAM block copolymers onto
silica nanoparticles with
a high grafting density using SI-RAFT polymerization. The resulting
nanoparticles exhibited responses to both pH and temperature in aqueous
solution as they dispersed individually at high pH and low temperature
but agglomerated and precipitated out under acidic conditions or at
elevated temperatures. DOX was loaded onto these nanoparticles with
a very high LC and EE, and the release rate was found to be controlled
by environmental pH and temperature. Cytotoxicity studies showed that
the DOX-loaded SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles
are highly active against Hela cells and more effective than free
DOX of an equivalent dose. The integration of these functionalities
may result in SiO2-PMAA-b-PNIPAM nanoparticles
becoming ideal drug carriers for anticancer drug delivery and biomedical
applications.
