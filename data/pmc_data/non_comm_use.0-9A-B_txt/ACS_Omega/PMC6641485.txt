Terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was used to study
the asphaltenes in different crude oils. THz-TDS has a feature of
measuring the amplitude and time delay and consequently the refractive
index and absorption coefficient spectra simultaneously. Our approach
was based on measuring the THz signal from neat crude oil samples
and comparing it with the THz signal after removing the asphaltene
from the oil samples (maltene). The results show that the differences in the time delay and the peak
amplitude between the neat oil and the maltene have a linear relation
with the asphaltene content. The refractive index spectra of the asphaltene
show variation in the low THz frequencies and comparable spectra in
the higher frequencies. The absorption of the asphaltene was mild,
and no distinctive absorption feature was observed except for some
narrow absorption peaks that we attributed to water molecules adsorbed
on the asphaltene.

Introduction
Over the past 3 decades, crude oil has
remained the largest source
of energy in the globe, with approximately 33% of the energy in 2016.1 Operations in the oil and gas industry are full
of complexity, and the presence of asphaltenes is critical to different
phases of the oil industry.2 Asphaltenes
are the heaviest, densest, and most polar components in crude oil.
They are a complex mixture of thousands of chemical components that
have a deleterious effect on the production, transportation, and refining
processes.3−5 Because of their chemical and structural complexity,
asphaltenes are defined by their high solubility in aromatic solvents
(e.g., toluene) and low solubility in n-alkanes solvents
(e.g., n-heptane).5 Asphaltenes’
tendency toward precipitation and deposition often causes serious
problems for the wellbores and pipelines such as clogging and corrosion,
which reduce the oil flow and increase the nonproduction time due
to maintenance.5 To address these asphaltene-related
issues, researchers have investigated spectroscopic and analytical
techniques for quantification and basic understanding.6,7

The measurement of the asphaltene content is an important
parameter
to determine the quality and properties of oil. Therefore, an accurate
and efficient method to determine the asphaltene content is crucial.
There are few standardized methods reported in the past to measure
asphaltenes.8−10 They are gravimetric-based methods that work by adding n-alkane to precipitate the solid particles, followed by
separating them by either filtration or centrifugation, and finally
weighing the asphaltene using a balance scale. Even though this method
is simple, it is time-consuming and requires a lot of solvent and
a laboratory environment. The main disadvantage of this approach is
the poor reproducibility that can show variations up to 20%, particularly
from oil with low asphaltene content.9 There
have been numerous reports to address the gravimetric method issues
using spectroscopic techniques. Part of these works aimed to measure
the asphaltenes directly from the oil without extractions using techniques
such as fluorescence spectroscopy,11 Fourier
transform infrared,12 near-infrared (NIR),13 mid-infrared,14 all
along with chemometric methods. On the other hand, another work has
used a combination of separation and optical absorption efficiently
to measure the asphaltene.15 The latter
approach proved to be more accurate, as it removes the uncertainty
that comes from the analogous and interfering molecules to asphaltene
such as resin. Complementary to the asphaltene content measurement,
measuring the asphaltene precipitation onset point is important for
understanding the asphaltene phase behavior, and it is often measured
by refractive index-based techniques.16−20 Since optical absorption and refractive index have
been important techniques to probe different properties of the asphaltene,
it would be beneficial to find a technique that provides both simultaneously.
Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has this advantage intrinsically,
but there is a lack of literature on this topic.

Terahertz technologies
are being applied in a wide range of areas
such as imaging,21 security,22 medical,23 communications,24 and spectroscopy.25 The THz-TDS technique gives information about both amplitude and
phase of the sample under test, which enables us to calculate the
real and imaginary parts of the refractive index simultaneously, with
negligible harmful effect to the sample due to the low photon energy
of the waves.26,27 Recently, this spectroscopic
technique has found its way to petroleum applications in different
reports. It has been proven that the THz technique can be used to
qualitatively identify the source of crude oil among different samples
based on absorption and the refractive index spectrum.28 Other works include detecting the disaggregation
of the crude oil particles in the presence of a magnetic field,29 characterizing wax crystals in waxy crude oil,30 measuring the water content in crude oil,31,32 measuring the properties of some crude oil products,33−36 natural gas,37 and coal,38 and all of these have only been presented over the past
few years.

In this work, we study asphaltenes using THz-TDS
in crude oil samples
that have different asphaltene contents. Our approach was to investigate
the effect of the asphaltene fraction on the THz signals of the crude
oil. To do that, we have compared both the THz time-domain signal
and frequency domain spectrum between the neat crude oil and the deasphaltened
crude oil samples (maltene) of different oils. We found that the difference
in the time delay of the peak of the THz time-domain signal correlates
well with the asphaltene content of the crude oil. On the other hand,
the absorption of the time-domain peak signal seems to correlate with
the asphaltene content but with less sensitivity. We have also noticed
that the crude oil frequency domain spectrum has absorption lines
that match the lines of the water. These absorption lines disappear
when the asphaltenes have been removed from the oil.

Results and Discussion
The interesting feature of THz waves to propagate through an opaque
oil sample28 made it convenient for us
to study asphaltene in crude oil. Figure 1 shows THz time-domain signals of a crude
oil sample that were taken at two thicknesses; 10 and 20 mm. It is
clear that the oil absorption is relatively low. In fact, when considering
the Beer–Lambert law for this oil sample, we can find that
THz waves can be detected easily even at thicknesses larger than 100
mm. This will make THz a promising technology for in situ, noninvasive
crude oil characterization.

Figure 1 THz signal propagates though empty sample holder
and oil samples
at 10 and 20 mm thickness.

Figure 2a
shows
the time-domain waveform of the reference scan (empty sample holder),
neat oil, and the deasphaltened oil (maltene) from oil 1 in the 10
mm thick side of the sample holder. There are few observations that
can be made about the peak time and the peak amplitude. First, we
can see that there is a negative shift in the time delay between the
neat oil peak time and the maltene peak time. Second, there is change
in the peak amplitude between the neat oil and the maltene, where
the peak amplitude became a little stronger after removing the asphaltene.
The measurement was done for oil samples 2 and 3 as well, and it was
found that the time shift and the change in the peak-to-peak amplitude,
between the neat oil and maltene, have a linear relation with the
asphaltene concentration as shown in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) Reference, oil, and maltene THz time-domain

1 taken at 10 mm sample thickness. (b) Relation between the asphaltene
content and peak time delay and absorption change in oil 1, oil 2,
and oil 3. (c) Reference, oil, and maltene THz time-domain signal

content and peak time delay and absorption change in oil 4, oil 5,
and oil 6.

The oil samples 4, 5, and 6 which
have less asphaltene content
(<2%) have been measured by the 20 mm side of the sample holder. Figure 2c shows the time-domain
waveform of the reference, neat oil, and the maltene of oil 4. Increasing
the sample thickness will result in longer travel time for the THz
pulse and larger time/amplitude shift between the oil and maltene,
therefore, an increase in the resolution. Figure 2d shows the relation between the asphaltene
content and both the shift in time delay and the change in peak-to-peak
amplitude, and the same linear trend can be seen here too. The only
sample where THz transmission was not achieved was oil 7. This is
not consistent with the fact that oils and hydrocarbons have mild
absorption, which has been shown here and in the literature.28−30 Therefore, we think that this might be due to impurities in the
fluid, sand, for example, that have high absorption in the THz range.

To have a clearer linear fit, we have combined the data in Figure 2b,d in one plot as
shown in Figure 3.
This is done by normalizing the time delay data of oil (4–6)
by the ratio of the sample’s thickness (20 mm/10 mm) and by
expressing the peak-to-peak change in terms of optical density (OD)
change (ΔOD = ODmaltene – ODoil). We chose to use OD rather than the absolute amplitude because
the measurements were done at different times and the reference THz
signal amplitude cannot be always the same. The linear trend was improved
by combining both measurements with linearity of R2 = 0.98 in the peak time versus the asphaltene content
plot. As these oil samples were taken from different geographic locations
around the world, the results shown in Figure 3 indicate that this method has the potential
to be used in measuring the asphaltene content of any oil sample in
a similar procedure to what has been reported before using optical
spectroscopy.15 In that way, the measurement
can be done within approximately 2–3 h and consume significantly
less solvent and oil samples with an accuracy that could outperform
the traditional gravimetric methods.

Figure 3 Relation between asphaltene content and
both the change in peak
time and the change in the OD of the peak-to-peak amplitude in 6 oil
samples.

On the basis of the sensitivity
of this result which is 0.079 (ps/10
mm) per 1% asphaltene content and the standard deviation of the measurement
which is 0.012 ps, the asphaltene limit of detection (LOD) was calculated
to be 0.46%. This was done by taking the LOD to be 3 times the standard
deviation. The crude oil absorption in the THz frequencies is very
moderate, and so this LOD can be simply boosted by just increasing
the oil sample thickness. For example, by increasing the sample thickness
from 10 to 50 mm, which will still result in a detectable signal,
the LOD will decrease to 0.09%.

The principle behind the negative
peak shift that we see after
removing the asphaltene can be explained by the Lorentz–Lorenz
relation (eq 1).17 This equation describes the relation between
the refractive indices of a multicomponent mixture. Asphaltene has
the highest refractive index in the crude oil and when the asphaltene
is removed, the effective refractive index of the oil is reduced.
As a result, the THz pulse travels faster through oil without asphaltene
compared with oil with asphaltene, resulting in what we see as a negative
shift in the peak time between the neat oil and the maltene.

The change in amplitude due to asphaltene removal can be explained
by the Beer–Lambert law. The Beer–Lambert law is often
used in THz spectroscopy as a tool to determine the absorbance and
concentration of a particular component in a multicomponent mixture.39,40 According to Beer’s law, if a solution consists of two components,
the total absorption can be regarded as a linear combination of both
components by A = e1c1l + e2c2l, where e is the molar absorptivity and c is the
concentration. Confirming the validity of Beer’s law is often
done by measuring the absorption of one component in a solution at
different concentrations. This was challenging to verify here because
asphaltene is only soluble in toluene and at low concentration (<1%)
before they aggregate and deposit and because the absorption of toluene
is higher than that of asphaltene. It was not possible to observe
a clear change in the absorption as result of varying the asphaltene
concentration. However, the result shown in Figure 3 suggests that this relation is valid to
a high degree. 1  

The refractive
index of the oil and maltene can be calculated directly
from the measured time-domain signal, and subsequently, the asphaltene
refractive index can be estimated from these two spectra. The refractive
index is calculated by 1 + [φc/ωd], where φ is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) phase
difference between the sample and the empty sample holder signals,
ω is the angular frequency, c is the speed
of light in vacuum, and d is the sample thickness.27 As shown in eq 1, the oil can be considered as a mixture of two components,
maltene and asphaltene, where noil, nmal, and nasp are
the refractive index spectra of the neat oil, maltene, and asphaltene,
respectively. ϕasp is the asphaltene fraction of
the crude oil, which can be calculated by measuring the asphaltene
mass and considering its density to be 1.2 g/mL,41,42 and ϕmal is the maltene fraction of the crude oil
(ϕmal = 1 – ϕasp). The nasp can be extracted from this equation because
all other variables can be either measured or calculated.

Figure 4 shows the
calculated asphaltene refractive index spectra from oil samples 1,
2, and 3 in the range of (0.3–2.2) THz. The asphaltene from
oil 1 and oil 3 have exponential decay-like spectra, whereas the asphaltene
from oil 2 did not exhibit the same feature but instead it shows an
almost constant refractive index in the reported range. All asphaltene
refractive index spectra seem to stabilize within the values of (1.75–1.85)
in the spectral range of (1.5–2.2) THz. The refractive index
relates to the polarity of the material and because the asphaltene
polarity is linked to the heteroatom and metal content,41 we may infer that the variation in the refractive
index is due to the variation of the heteroatoms of the asphaltene.
In fact, some polar fluids such as ethanol and water have this feature
at lower THz frequencies,43 which gives
us another reason to think that this is due to asphaltene polarity.
The accuracy of the reported refractive index is subject to error
because of variations in the asphaltene density or because of variations
of the asphaltene measurement. When the asphaltene content is low,
its measurement has higher uncertainty; therefore, we limited the
calculation to oils with high asphaltene content. This measurement
gives us an idea of the refractive index of asphaltene where no other
data are available in the literature.

Figure 4 Calculated refractive index of asphaltene
from oil 1, oil 2, and
oil 3.

The absorption spectra of the
asphaltene can be estimated by calculating
both maltene and oil absorption coefficients and taking the difference
between them. After applying the FFT to the time-domain signals, the
THz frequency spectra of the reference, neat oil, and the maltene
are calculated. The absorption coefficient α can be calculated
by −(2/d)ln{T(n + 1)2/4n}, where T is
the FFT magnitude ratio between sample and reference signals, d is the sample thickness, and n is the
refractive index.27

Figure 5a shows
the THz frequency spectra of the reference, neat oil, and the maltene
of oil 1, whereas Figure 5b shows the corresponding calculated absorption coefficient
of the neat oil, the maltene, and the difference which we attributed
to asphaltene. The reference signal has a bandwidth of roughly 4 THz,
but because the oil has stronger absorption in the high frequencies,
the effective spectra became less than 2.5 THz (the signal approaches
the noise floor beyond this frequency). Similarly, the asphaltene
absorption spectra of the other oils have been calculated and plotted
together in Figure 6. The figure shows that asphaltene has mild absorption. Only the
asphaltene from oil 2, which has the highest asphaltene content, has
clear absorption across all of the frequency range. Because the asphaltenes
are the most polar components in the crude oil with the dipole moment
larger than water,41 the asphaltene absorption
was less than what we anticipated, especially in the asphaltene-rich
oil samples.

and maltene
of oil 1. (b) Absorption coefficient of oil, maltene, and asphaltene
of oil 1.

Figure 6 Comparison of the asphaltene absorption from
6 oils.

The asphaltene absorption of some
of the samples was unnoticeable
(close to zero), and in some frequencies, it was negative. Negative
absorption is not real in this case, as it is not consistent with
the time-domain signal shown in Figures 2 and 3. The time-domain
signal measurement is more rigorous, as it is directly measured from
the detector without processing or assumptions, whereas the frequency
domain spectra is a result of the Fourier transform algorithm, which
is more susceptible to variation when not all the conditions to apply
the algorithm are met. The purpose of calculating the asphaltene absorption
spectra was not to use it as a quantitative measure but mainly to
detect any absorption peaks because molecules of this size usually
vibrate at the THz range. These peaks can only be determined by applying
FFT to the time signal, but the result did not show any clear peaks.
It is also worth mentioning that we are not considering the complex
Fresnel transmission coefficients at the sample holder oil interface
and the oil sample holder interface. The change in the refractive
index because of the asphaltenes’ removal will change this
coefficient slightly and consequently will add some uncertainty to
the results.

In addition, Figure 6 shows that there are some narrow absorption lines
in the asphaltene
absorption spectra, especially in the oils that have larger asphaltene
content. Those lines match well with the water absorption lines.44 The vertical lines in Figure 6, which represent the typical water absorption
lines, overlap with all of the clear absorption lines in the asphaltene
spectra. However, not all expected water lines are seen in the spectra.
The water absorption lines do not appear when probing water molecules
as bulk water but instead they appear when measuring water in the
vapor phase or when adsorbed on a material at very low quantity to
the level that it does not form bulk water.44 There have been many reports in the literature that confirm the
interactions between the asphaltenes and water, though these interaction
mechanisms are not well understood.45,46 What is known
is that the asphaltenes absorb moisture,47 and the asphaltene content have a linear relation with the water
content of the crude oil.48

On the
basis of the measurement data and the literature, it may
be inferred that these lines come from scattered water molecules in
the oil that was adsorbed on the asphaltenes and that the water was
removed during the asphaltene separation process. In addition, the
fact that there is a reasonably linear trend, as shown in Figure 7, between the summation
of all absorption peaks of the water lines and the asphaltene content
make us lean more toward this conclusion.

Figure 7 Total intensity of the
water lines (summation of all the peaks)
measured in Figure 6 vs the asphaltene content.

The high OD of crude oils and asphaltenes made it challenging
to
measure their refractive index and absorption in the visible and NIR
range without excessive dilution.15,17 On the other
hand, the mild absorption of the crude oil and asphaltene in the THz
frequencies made it possible to measure thick samples in the transmission
configuration. The result of this work shows the potential of the
THz-TDS to be used in the future in various application such as measuring
asphaltene content, asphaltene precipitation onset, and asphaltene
yield curve.

Conclusion
In this work, THz-TDS
was used to study asphaltenes in different
crude oils. The difference in the time delay and the peak amplitude
between the neat crude oil and the maltene correlated linearly with
the asphaltene content. Variation was found in the refractive index
spectra of the asphaltene from different oils in the low THz frequencies
and comparable spectra in the higher frequencies. The absorption coefficient
spectra show a mild absorption because of asphaltene with no clear
feature except for some narrow absorption lines that we attributed
to water molecules adsorbed on the asphaltene. The water molecules
may provide a more specific (albeit proxy) spectral feature for asphaltene
in oil but do not show as good linearity as the refractive index and
absorption variations.

(THz-TDS) Measurements
Figure 8a shows
the THz-TDS setup (TeTechs, Inc.
Waterloo, Canada) that was used in this work. The measurement was
done in transmission configuration in free space spectroscopy.25−27 A 1550 nm 80 femtosecond laser (Calmar) was used as pump and probe
beams to generate and detect the THz signal. To get a higher THz bandwidth,
we have used a photoconductive antenna (PCA) reported previously.49 The length of the probe beam path was varied
with the delay-line to change the spectral position of the (THz-TDS)
waveform. To get higher resolution frequency spectra, the scanning
length was set to 30 mm which corresponds to 200 ps. The transmitter
PCA was biased with 80 V and the pump beam was chopped with 10 kHz.
The signal from the receiver PCA was sent to a lock-in amplifier and
then to a computer for processing. We used a sample holder made of
Teflon (poly(tetrafluoroethylene)), as this material has a little
absorption in the THz range.50 The dimensions
of the holder are 10 × 20 mm and hold a sample of approximately
2.5 mL. Figure 8b shows
the THz time-domain waveform under ambient condition and after it
has been purged with nitrogen. The whole setup was enclosed in a glass
box and purged with nitrogen until the relative humidity was less
than 3%. Under these conditions, no absorption lines were observed
in the frequency domain spectrum as shown in Figure 8c.

Extractions and Measurement of the Asphaltene
Content
The asphaltene content was measured following the
procedure reported
in ref (10), which
can be described in three steps. First, 10 g of the oil was mixed
with n-heptane at a volume ratio of 1:40 and left
for two days in the dark to reach equilibrium. The mixture was filtered
using 0.22 μm membrane filter paper a few consecutive times.
The filter cake was washed with hot n-heptane until
the effluent was almost colorless. Second, the recovered asphaltenes
were dissolved again in toluene at approximately 1 g/100 mL concentration
and the mixture was filtered. The reason for this step is to remove
any nonasphaltene solids, such as sand, and dissolve the maltene molecules
adsorbed on asphaltene. Finally, the asphaltene in the (asphaltene/toluene)
mixture needs to be precipitated and measured again. This is done
by mixing this mixture with heptane at 1:40 ratio. The size of the
(asphaltene/toluene) mixture is large and would need a huge amount
of heptane to precipitate the asphaltene; therefore, the size of the
(asphaltene/toluene) mixture was reduced to about 10 mL by evaporating
the toluene. Then mixture was mixed with heptane at 1:40 ratio and
filtered. The recovered asphaltene was left to dry and then it was
weighed. This method is time-consuming and needs up to 1 L of solvents
for a single oil sample. The measured percentages of asphaltene in
the oils used in this work are listed in Table 1.

To get the maltene fluid for each
oil (oil w/o asphaltene), the filtered mixture from the first step
was vacuum-evaporated to remove the heptane until there was no notable
change in the weight with continuing evaporation.
