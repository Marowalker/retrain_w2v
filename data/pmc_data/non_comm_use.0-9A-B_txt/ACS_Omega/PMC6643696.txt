Previously, the molecular
structure of ionic liquids (ILs) next
to a solid surface has been extensively studied because the IL–solid
interfaces are critical to many important applications. What is largely
unknown is the mobility of ILs confined to a solid surface. The solid-like
stable structure of ILs on the solid surfaces has been reported in
previous research, which indicates that the mobility of ILs next to
a solid surface is quite low and the structure of ILs will not change
with time. However, here, we show that the nanodroplets of ILs flow
on the mica surface, which suggest that, at a small scale, the solid-like
stable structure of ILs on the solid surfaces indeed changes with
time. Interestingly, although the IL nanodroplets show a layered structure,
no terrace-like flow of the droplet has been observed, which has been
attributed to the weak mica–IL interaction at low humidity.

Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs) have garnered a lot
of interest because of
their outstanding physicochemical properties.1−3 The IL–solid
interfacial behavior is especially critical to many important applications,
such as lubrication4−6 and catalysis.7 To date,
many experimental and computational studies on the molecular structure
of ILs on the solid surface have been reported.8 Liu et al. demonstrated the coexistence of drop-on-layer
structure and solid-like ordered layers of ILs on the mica surface.9 Bovio et al. reported that ILs formed the solid-like
layering structure on mica and silica surfaces.10 On the basis of experimental and computational studies,
Bovio et al. also showed the remarkable stability of the layering
structure of ILs on the silica; for example, the layering is stable
for a few months, revealing that ILs on the silica are solid-like
and have very low mobility.11 Yokota et
al. showed the layered structure at IL–solid interfaces is
solid-like rather than liquid-like using frequency-modulation atomic
force microscopy (AFM) and also concluded that the solid-like layering
structure is highly stable.12 Using surface
force apparatus (SFA), Buo-Malham et al. showed that ILs on the mica
surface exhibit a solid-like response.13 Dragoni et al. provided evidence for the solid-like behavior of
ILs on the mica, which might explain the remarkable stability of ionogels
made of inorganic nanoparticles and ILs.14 Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments showed
that the IL at the IL–solid (laponite clay) interface forms
a thin solid layer.15 Atkin et al. investigated
the structure of ILs on the Au(111) surfaces and reported that an
interfacial layer of ILs was strongly bound to the solid surface,
which could not be ruptured by the colloid probe.16 They also reported that ILs self-assemble at the solid
surface via hydrogen bonding.17 On the
basis of SFA results, Perkin et al. also reported the ordered self-assembly
structure of ILs on the mica surface.18,19 Using molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation, Sha et al. demonstrated that the IL layer
possesses the highest density next to the solid surface, which is
believed to be in a solid-like or solid state because of strong interactions
at the graphite–IL interface.20

In all of the abovementioned studies, the solid-like low mobility
of ILs was reported. Interestingly, the liquid-like flow of ILs on
solid surfaces was also reported. Wang et al.21 found that macroscopic IL droplets spread on the mica surface gradually
and there is a precursor film ahead of the spreading front. Beattie
et al.22 found that molecular-thin precursor
films emerge from the macroscopic droplet of ILs on the mica surface.
Clearly, further research is required to fully understand the mobility
of ILs on a solid surface.23 The study
on the spreading of a droplet, especially at a small scale, provides
insight into the mobility of the liquid at the liquid–solid
interface.24 It has been reported that
the microdroplets of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) spread slowly on
a silicon wafer and a series of distinct molecular layers were observed
at the spreading front, which is defined as “terrace-like”
flow.24 However, to date, only macroscopic
spreading of ILs on mica has been studied, and there has been no report
on the spreading of IL nanodroplets.25 Here,
we report the first experimental results on the spreading of the IL
nanodroplets on the mica surface. AFM results revealed a very slow
spreading process, for example, up to ∼30 h, in which the nanoscale
IL undergoes the transition from a droplet to a “pancake”.
Interestingly, although IL nanodroplets show a random layering structure,
no terrace-like flow has been observed.

Results and Discussion
1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate
(BMIM-FAP) was applied on the mica via dip-coating26 at a relative humidity (RH) of ∼20% at room temperature.
The topography of the sample was characterized by AFM as a function
of time, and the results are shown in Figure 1. Initially, many IL droplets, with a height
of ∼40 nm and a diameter of ∼800 nm, were observed,
which is consistent with previous reports.9,27 Recently,
on the basis of the experimental results of both AFM and attenuated
total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Gong et
al.27 proposed that the water adsorption
on the mica promotes the extended layering of ILs on the solid surface,
whereas dewetting of ILs, that is, droplets, occurs when the water
is removed from the mica surface. They proposed a “water-enabled
surface charging” mechanism to explain the finding. Because
ILs have low dielectric constants, they do not dissolve and mobilize
K+ ions on the mica surface effectively. As a result, ILs
cannot induce the charging on the dry mica surface. However, when
water, which has a high dielectric constant, is adsorbed on the mica
surface, K+ ions will be dissolved and then leave the mica
surface. Therefore, the wet mica surface will be negatively charged.
Afterward, the cations of the IL take the “empty” site
left by K+, initiating the alternative layering of cations/anions
of the IL. As a result, on mica, the IL forms a layered structure
at high humidity and shows droplets at low humidity. The finding here
that BMIM-FAP showing nanodroplets at 20% RH is consistent with the
proposed mechanism. Zhang et al.28 investigated
the effect of water on the molecular structure of ILs on the mica
surfaces with two different charge densities by MD simulations. They
demonstrated that water changes the layering structure of IL ions
next to the mica surface, as well as the lateral and orientation ordering.
Cheng et al.29 performed AFM force–distance
experiments and reported the bilayer formation of ILs at the charged
mica surface in the presence of water. Meanwhile, they showed that
the ILs are disordered at the low-charged surface in dry environments.

Figure 1 In situ
AFM images of structure evolution of BMIM-FAP on mica (from
0 to 29 h) at room temperature. Images are 5.5 × 5.5 μm.

Interestingly, the nanodroplets
gradually spread on the mica surface
with time. As shown in Figure 1, the IL nanodroplets initially spread isotropically. However,
once getting closer to each other, the droplets spread anisotropically.
It should be noted that the tapping-mode AFM tip did not disturb the
liquid molecular layers because we repeated the scanning of the morphology
and did not observe any difference, which agrees well with Beattie’s22 and Liu’s9 reports. The central height profiles of one nanodroplet (droplet
1 as labeled in Figure 1), as a function of evolution time, are shown in Figure 2. It clearly showed that the
droplet becomes a pancake after ∼30 h. However, no terrace-like
flow was observed. In a terrace-like flow, a monolayer will develop
and flow on the substrate while the rest of the droplet stays still.
After a certain time, the second monolayer will develop on top of
the first one and flow while the rest of the droplet on top of the
two monolayers stays still. With the evolution of the flow, a terrace-like
structure will be formed. As shown in Figure 2, the BMIM-FAP nanodroplet flows like a bulk
liquid, and there is no sign of terrace-like flow.

of nanodroplet as a function of evolution
time (measured from droplet 1). The inset shows a graph that schematically
illustrates what terrace-like flow is.

A typical AFM topography image during the spreading is shown
in Figure 3. Interestingly,
from the corresponding line profile of the nanodroplet, during the
spreading, the IL showed a clear sign of layering structure as evidenced
by the step-like feature with a thickness of either 1 or 2 nm, which
corresponds to either a monolayer or a double-layer structure. In
other words, although no terrace-like flow was observed, the IL nanodroplet
does have a layered structure.

spreading.

The layered structure of the BMIM-FAP
nanodroplet is further demonstrated
by the AFM image in the late stage, for example, after 40 and 49 h,
of spreading as shown in Figure 4. Although, in most cases, the layering is not clearly
visible (Figure 4d),
the layering structure was still observed in some locations (as shown
in the red arrows of Figure 4c) when these nanodroplets merge and form “uniform”
(but porous) films. The results indicate that the nanodroplets are
composed of layers of IL molecules. Interestingly, many “holes”
are observed as shown in Figure 4, which could be attributed to airborne hydrocarbon
contamination and the resulting lower surface tension in the local
area.

h. The white line square shows the same region in Figure 1. (c) and (d) show the corresponding
line profiles in (a) and (b).

It is unclear why the IL nanodroplet has a layered structure
but
does not show terrace-like flow. One possible reason is that IL–mica
attraction is to too weak to initiate the flow of the bottom layer.
Previously, Gong et al.27 showed that moisture
is critical to the surface charging of the mica and the resulting
mica–IL attraction. Only when the RH is high, for example,
above ∼50–60%, K+ on the mica will be dissolved
and mobilized so that it will leave the surface of mica. As a result,
the cation of the IL will occupy the empty site and initiate the layering
of the IL. In the current study, RH is only 20%, and the water-enabled
surface charging of mica will not occur.30 As a result, the IL–mica attraction is not strong enough
for the flow of the monolayer to occur. However, the bulk-like liquid
flow is still possible as evidenced by the results shown in Figure 2. Further research
at various RH is required to uncover the governing mechanism.

Macroscale spreading of BMIM-FAP on the mica surface was also investigated
by characterizing the time-dependent contact angles of BMIM-FAP on
the mica. As shown in Figure 5, the contact angle is initially ∼22°, decreases
slightly within the first 5 min, and then stabilizes at around 17°.
There was no significant change of the contact angle for up to 8 h
afterward. Clearly, our AFM (Figures 1 and 2) and contact angle results
indicate that the spreading kinetics of IL droplets at the macroscale
and nanoscale is very different. The spreading is much slower, that
is, two to three orders of magnitude, at the nanoscale. A possible
mechanism is as follows. The solid-like layered structure of ILs at
the IL–mica interface only extends to a few to tens of nanometers
from the mica surface.10 Within this region,
the mobility of the solid-like ILs is expected to be significantly
lower than that of bulk ILs. The nanoscale droplets are within this
region and therefore spread very slowly. For the contact angle tests
of macroscale droplets, this nanoscale effect cannot be detected at
all because of the resolution limit of the contact angle tester. Instead,
the faster spreading of macroscale droplets, which have the mobility
of bulk ILs, is captured.

BMIM-FAP on the mica
surface for up to 8 h.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we characterized the spreading
of IL nanodroplets
at the IL–mica interface by AFM. Our results showed that a
nanodroplet of IL spreads on the mica surface very slowly and eventually
becomes a pancake. The results suggest that ILs confined to a solid
surface have much lower mobility than the bulk phase; however, they
are still mobile. As a result, the topography of the nanoconfined
IL is strongly dependent on time. Interestingly, although the IL nanodroplet
shows a layered structure, no terrace-like flow of the droplet has
been observed. This has been attributed to the weak mica–IL
interaction at low humidity.

Experimental Section
Materials
A high
purity grade (>99%) IL, BMIM-FAP (viscosity:
93 cP; mp: 3 °C), was purchased from EMD Millipore Corp. The
BMIM-FAP was used as received. A good solvent for BMIM-FAP, 2,3-dihydrodecafluoropentane
that is commercially known as Vertrel XF,26,27 was purchased from Miller-Stephenson Chemical Co. and utilized without
further purification. Muscovite mica of grade V1 with a thickness
of 0.18–0.25 mm was obtained from Ted Pella and used as received.
In the experiment, the mica was cut into small sheets with a size
of ∼1.5 × 2 cm. In each experiment, a razor blade was
inserted into a mica sheet from the edge, and thus, two pieces of
mica were produced.

Sample Fabrication
BMIM-FAP was
dissolved in the Vertrel
solvent at 1 g/L and then dip-coated on the mica according to a previously
established procedure in our lab,26,27 with a KSV-DCX2
dip-coater staying on top of a Kinetic Systems vibration-free platform.
The withdrawal rate of the mica was 60 mm/min.

Characterizations
Tapping-mode AFM images were obtained
with a Veeco Dimension V system. The sample was imaged in soft tapping
mode with an Olympus AC200TS silicon AFM probe (nominal spring constant:
9.7 N/m; resonance frequency: 115 kHz). The experiments were performed
and characterized in a clean room to avoid humid air contamination
from the ambient atmosphere. The static contact angle of BMIM-FAP
on the mica surface was measured using a VCA Optima XE contact angle
tester at room temperature and an RH of ∼20%.
