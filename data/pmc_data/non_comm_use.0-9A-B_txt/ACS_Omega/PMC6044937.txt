General and reliable description of structures and energetics in protein–ligand
(PL) binding using the docking/scoring methodology has until now been
elusive. We address this urgent deficiency of scoring functions (SFs)
by the systematic development of corrected semiempirical quantum mechanical
(SQM) methods, which correctly describe all types of noncovalent interactions
and are fast enough to treat systems of thousands of atoms. Two most
accurate SQM methods, PM6-D3H4X and SCC-DFTB3-D3H4X, are coupled with
the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) implicit solvation model
in so-called “SQM/COSMO” SFs and have shown unique recognition
of native ligand poses in cognate docking in four challenging PL systems,
including metalloprotein. Here, we apply the two SQM/COSMO SFs to
17 diverse PL complexes and compare their performance with four widely
used classical SFs (Glide XP, AutoDock4, AutoDock Vina, and UCSF Dock).
We observe superior performance of the SQM/COSMO SFs and identify
challenging systems. This method, due to its generality, comparability
across the chemical space, and lack of need for any system-specific
parameters, gives promise of becoming, after comprehensive large-scale
testing in the near future, a useful computational tool in structure-based
drug design and serving as a reference method for the development
of other SFs.

Introduction
In
structure-based drug design, docking/scoring is a prime and
well-established computational tool. Molecular docking generates ligand
geometries bound to the protein (poses), whereas scoring using scoring
functions (SFs) ranks them by the predicted affinity (score). Owing
to the approximations embodied in docking/scoring methods for the
sake of their acceleration, their accuracy has often been compromised.1 Nevertheless, recent methodological advances
made docking/scoring methods an indispensable tool in discovering
new protein ligands.2

The “docking
power” or “sampling power”3,4 of
a docking/scoring method is assessed by its ability to identify
the native ligand pose (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the
crystal pose <2 Å) in protein–ligand (PL) complexes.
Comprehensive testing across diverse PL complexes has shown that in
up to 80% of PL complexes this task can be accomplished.4−8 However, classical SFs had troubles with the identification of the
native binding mode as the best-scoring pose (especially in the case
of metalloproteins, halogenated ligands, inorganic ligands, etc.).4 Thus, reliable identification of native PL poses
within a diverse set of PL complexes using a single SF remains a challenging
task.3,4,9

The four
major approaches toward scoring are empirical,10−12 knowledge-based,8,13,14 statistical/machine learning,15,16 and physics-based.17,18 The first three approaches require
a training set, and by use of
parametrization and statistics, useful models can be obtained.19 However, because these approaches are dependent
on the training set, their predictive power is limited. In contrast,
physics-based methods rely on a generally valid description of PL
interactions. Traditionally, such approaches were limited to molecular
mechanics (MM) methods and simplified variants thereof. Thus, these
approaches were inherently limited by the underlying approximations,
most importantly the implicit treatment of electrons.

A general
solution to the problem of accurately calculating noncovalent
interactions in PL systems is the use of quantum mechanics (QM).20 With QM methods, phenomena of quantum origin,
such as charge transfer, are described without further ad hoc parametrization.
This is important for systems involving halogen bonding,21,22 metalloprotein binding,23 inorganic ligands,24−26 or covalent bond formation.27 But because
of the high computational demands, QM calculations of sufficient quality
(e.g., DFT-D3 level with a triple-ζ basis set) are limited to
a few hundred atoms. This limitation can be overcome by use of fragmentation28,29 or a QM/MM approach.30−34 Another route is the use of semiempirical QM (SQM). The first QM-based
SF was introduced by the Merz group.35 They
combined the Austin model 1 (AM1) SQM method with empirical dispersion
(D) and implicit solvation (Poisson–Boltzmann
(PB) model). Its validation on a large dataset of PL complexes showed
its superior performance, especially for metalloprotein–ligand
complexes.36 Although this was an important
pioneering step, the accuracy of the underlying methods, both for
the vacuum part (AM1-D)37 and for solvation
(PB),38 was not sufficient to yield quantitative
results. More recently, Sulimov laboratory used the PM7 SQM method39 in conjunction with the conductor-like
screening model (COSMO) implicit solvent model40 for identification of native ligand poses of 16 PL complexes
in cognate docking.41,42 They showed superior performance
of their SQM/COSMO SFs over force-field-based scoring. We should note
here that PM7 results for noncovalent interactions can be slightly
improved by using the latest version of empirical corrections to the
PM6 SQM method (PM6-D3H4X, see below).43

In our laboratory, we have been systematically developing
empirical
corrections to SQM methods to accurately treat an array of noncovalent
interactions.20 The latest version of empirical
corrections for dispersion, hydrogen bonding, and halogen bonding
yielded the PM6-D3H4X37,44 method, which, coupled with the
COSMO implicit solvent model,40 forms the
core of our SQM-based SF (eq 1).45,46 1  The score (an estimate of the PL binding free
energy) is expressed as an unweighted sum of thermodynamic terms.
It consists of the gas-phase PL interaction energy (ΔEint), the change in solvation/desolvation free
energy upon complex formation (ΔΔGsolv), the change in the conformation “free”
energies of the protein and ligand [ΔG′wconf(P,L)], and
the interaction entropy change upon binding (TΔSint).45,46 The PL complexes are
optimized using the solution-phase SQM method before scoring. The
ΔEint term is favorable for complex
formation and usually is the largest in magnitude. It can reach a
few hundreds of kcal/mol for charged or polar ligands. The ΔΔGsolv term opposes binding and can be nearly
as large as the first term. These two dominant terms thus partially
compensate for each other, and the final score is an order of magnitude
smaller. Using this SF (eq 1), we have rationalized the binding of series of ligands to
a dozen of protein targets,21,22,46−50 including covalent ligand binding.27 It
should be noted that this SF can also be extended to evaluate explicit
solvent effects.47,48,51

Recently, we have accelerated our SQM-based SF by considering
only
the first two dominant terms and replacing the time-demanding SQM
optimization with a quick MM relaxation of hydrogens.23 We have shown in four difficult PL complexes that this
SQM/COSMO SF at the PM6-D3H4X level outperforms eight widely used
SFs in native ligand pose identification in cognate docking. The number
of false-positive (FP) solutions (i.e., those poses that scored better
than the native one) was up to 1 order of magnitude lower than that
for the classical SFs.23 In three PL cases,
it was even 0. In the challenging system of the tumor necrosis factor-α
converting enzyme (TACE) metalloprotein featuring Zn2+ in
the active site, which is bound by the thiolate group of the ligand,
39 FPs were found.23 A major improvement
(FP = 0)52 was observed when the ΔEint term was calculated with a more robust SQM
method, the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding
method augmented with empirical dispersion (previously shown to be
useful for the description of biomolecules)53 and hydrogen-bonding corrections (SCC-DFTB3-D3H4, abbreviated DFTB3-D3H4).54 The high-quality description of the other three
PL systems was retained.52 The price for
the improvement was a higher but not unsurmountable computational
cost. It should be noted that two recent studies used the uncorrected
SCC–DFTB method in a QM/MM setup and reported success on the
correct ligand binding geometries toward metalloproteins.31,32 Their approach toward the computationally expensive task was to
use a rather small QM part consisting of Zn2+, its coordinating
protein side chains, and the ligand on a large number of PL systems.31,32

In this study, we aim to validate our SQM/COSMO SFs23,52 for native pose identification in cognate docking on a data set
consisting of 17 PL complexes from five diverse classes, selected
using strict criteria for physics-based scoring. We apply two variants
of the SQM/COSMO SF (ΔEint term
at the PM6-D3H4X or DFTB3-D3H4X level)23,52 and compare
them with four standard SFs (Glide XP,55 AutoDock4,56 AutoDock Vina,57 and UCSF Dock58).
The performance criterion is the number of FPs23,52 with an extended definition presented here. We show here that the
unique behavior of the SQM/COSMO SFs observed in our recent studies23,52 hold across 17 diverse PL complexes and gives promise of generality
after comprehensive large-scale testing in the near future.

Results
and Discussion
Data Set
In this work, we extend
our previous pilot
studies on four difficult PL systems23,52 to 17 pharmaceutically
relevant and diverse PL complexes from five classes, including three
enzyme classes (transferase, hydrolase, and lyase), one chaperone,
and two nuclear receptor classes from the PBDbind “core set”59 (for details, see Methods section). We apply the strict criteria needed for physics-based
scoring. Specifically, the crystal structures of the complexes have
resolutions better than 2.5 Å, well-resolved electron densities
for the ligands, and protein active sites. The ligands have variable
chemistries, sizes (molecular weight of 305–666 Da), charges,
and flexibilities (for details, see Methods section). Their binding constants toward their targets range from
micro- to picomolar.

The crystal poses of the ligands were scored
as reference. The ligand poses generated previously by docking4 with seven docking programs (for details, see Methods section) totaled 4566 poses. RMSD-based
clustering (see Methods section) of the poses
was carried out to avoid pose redundancy. After this, the number of
poses decreased to 3328, corresponding to approximately 250 poses
per target. A comprehensive evaluation of the recognition of near-native
poses requires a balanced distribution of RMSDs of the docked ligand
poses with respect to the crystal (native) geometry from very similar
to very dissimilar (up to 10 Å). In most of the PL systems, 20–60%
of poses had RMSD <2 Å (Figure S1A). Furthermore, poses were evenly distributed in RMSD ranges of 2–5
and 5–10 Å (roughly 20–40% for each category). Figure S1B shows minimal RMSD (RMSDmin) for the poses studied. Near-native poses within the experimental
accuracy of X-ray crystallography of 0.5 Å60,61 were found in all but two cases (10GS: RMSDmin = 0.85 Å and 2VOT: RMSDmin = 0.70 Å). However, these cases only slightly exceeded the
threshold.

Scoring
For each of the six SFs
(two variants of SQM/COSMO
SF and four standard SFs; for details, see Methods section), the scores of the docked ligand poses in their respective
target proteins were calculated, transformed to relative scores with
respect to the score of the crystal pose, and normalized (see Methods section).

The overall sampling power
of all the SFs is shown as the enrichment plot (Figure S2), that is, the percent of PL cases (y axis) in which the best-scoring ligand of a given SF has defined
RMSD (x axis) to the crystal pose. In the standard
range of RMSD up to 2 Å, the SQM/COSMO SFs at the DFTB3-D3H4X
level perform the best (88% of PL systems), followed by SQM/COSMO
at the PM6-D3H4X level together with UCSF Dock (82% of PL systems).
Slightly worse is the performance of Glide XP (76%), followed by AutoDock4
(71%), and AutoDock Vina (65%) (Figure S2). In recognition of near-native poses (RMSD < 0.5 Å), the
two SQM/COSMO SFs together with AutoDock Vina perform the best (47%),
followed by AutoDock4 and UCSF Dock (41%) and Glide XP, which recognize
the poses only in 29% of cases.

The SQM/COSMO SFs also had the
lowest number of PL complexes (two
for DFTB3-D3H4X/COSMO, Table S1) for which
the best-scoring pose exceeded the threshold for success of 2 Å.
This was closely followed by SQM/COSMO at the PM6-D3H4X/COSMO level,
UCSF Dock, and Glide XP (three cases). Five and six failures were
found for Autodock4 and AutoDock Vina, respectively (Table S1). Averaging the RMSDs of the best-scoring poses across
all 17 PL complexes (and counting all the failures >2 Å as
2.1
Å), DFTB3-D3H4X/COSMO was the winner (0.71 Å), closely followed
by PM6-D3H4X/COSMO and UCSF Dock (0.77 and 0.79 Å, respectively; Table S1). Worse results (around 1 Å) were
obtained for AutoDock Vina, AutoDock4, and Glide XP.

For detailed
performance evaluations, we use the number of FP solutions
criterion23,52 with an extended definition presented here.
Previously, FPs were defined as those poses that scored better than
the native pose (defined by a 0.5 Å RMSD cutoff from the crystal
pose due to inaccuracies of crystal structures).23,52 Here, we allow room for larger uncertainties of native pose recognition
by defining “hard FPs” (HFP) in which the cutoffs were
increased to RMSD >2 Å and score better than −1 kcal/mol.
The RMSD cutoff now also includes the effects of flexible parts of
the ligands sticking out to the solvent, and the score cutoff corresponds
roughly to 2–3 kcal/mol of unscaled energies, which are rough
error bounds of the physics-based method. The HFPs for AutoDock Vina,
AutoDock4, Glide XP, and UCSF Dock were high—211, 350, 425,
and 635, respectively (Figure 1A). The SQM/COSMO SFs performed much better with the numbers
of HFPs being up to 1 order of magnitude smaller—40 and 42
for the DFTB3-D3H4X and PM6-D3H4X levels, respectively (Figure 1A).

Figure 1 Number of HFP solutions
for the six SFs used here across all the
17 PL systems studied. (A) Number of HFPs and (B) HFPs for individual
PL complexes sorted by ligand charge: neutral (left) and charged (right).

The number of HFPs for individual
PL complexes (Figure 1B and Table S2) differed markedly with respect to the ligand charge: in
the case of the neutral ligands (Figure 1B, left), they were by 1 order of magnitude
smaller than that for the charged ones (Figure 1B, right). For SQM/COSMO at the PM6-D3H4X
and DFTB3-D3H4X levels, the numbers of HFPs for neutral ligands were
single-digit values (1 and 2, respectively). The classical SFs performed
worse, with the number of HFPs ranging from 18 to 85 for neutral ligands
(Figure 1B, left and Table S2). The complex with the largest number
of HFPs was the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase/ligand complex (3GNW) with 71, 28, and
14 HFPs calculated with AutoDock4, UCSF Dock, and AutoDock Vina, respectively.
A large number of HFPs (40) was also observed for the cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 (CDK2)/ligand complex (2FVD) for Glide XP (Table S2).

The results show that the classical SFs had larger
troubles in
identifying the native binding poses for charged ligands (for the
classical SFs, more than 90% of HFPs were found for charged ligands).
The largest number of HFPs (140) was found with Glide XP for the α-l-fucosidase (2ZX6) PL complex, which had a positively charged ligand. For UCSF Dock,
four systems, 2P4Y, 4GID, 2VOT, and 3NOX, yielded in total
403 HFPs, which is 70% of HFPs for the charged ligands in that method
(577; Table S2). In contrast, the number
of HFPs for the charged ligands for the SQM/COSMO was in total 38
and 41 for DFTB3-D3H4X and PM6-D3H4X, respectively. This is considerably
lower than the classical SFs (193–577 HFPs) (Table S2). For SQM/COSMO at the DFTB3-D3H4X level, the largest
number of HFPs was 20 and 8 for 2P4Y and 3NOX, respectively. Also, PM6-D3H4X/COSMO
had some troubles with these systems (5 and 10 HFPs, respectively).
In both 2P4Y and 3NOX complexes,
the HFP poses have the ligand cores placed at very similar positions
as the crystal pose, whereas moieties sticking out to the solvent
(the benzisoxazol and morpholino groups, respectively) had fewer noncovalent
interactions with the protein. This can be one reason why poses with
higher RMSD could score well. Other reasons can be some of the approximations
embedded in our protocol for speed, such as the neglected terms in
the SQM/COSMO SF (change of conformational energy, entropy) or explicit
water molecules, which may need to be included in some PL systems
for reliable description of the energetics.47,51

Conclusions
The sampling (docking) power, that is,
the ability to recognize
a ligand native pose in cognate PL docking, of two variants of quantum-mechanics-based
SQM/COSMO SFs is tested here on 17 PL systems from five diverse protein
families carefully selected for physics-based SFs. For comparison,
four standard SFs—Glide XP, AutoDock4, AutoDock Vina, and UCSF
Dock, are used. The SQM/COSMO SFs at the PM6-D3H4X and DFTB3-D3H4X
levels markedly outperform the standard SFs as judged by the number
of HFP poses. The time requirements for the SQM/COSMO SF (Table S3) are higher than those for classical
SFs, but given the supercomputer power, thousands of docking poses
can be evaluated in a reasonable time. The results of the freely available
SQM/COSMO SFs give promise of generality, and after comprehensive
large-scale testing in the near future, this method could serve as
a useful tool in structure-based drug design and reference for SF
development.

Methods
Data Set
QM-based
interaction energy calculations require
sensible geometries and, therefore, we needed good-quality structures
of PL complexes. The crystallographic structures should have fair
resolution (<2.5 Å) with fully resolved electron density for
the entire ligand and surrounding binding site residues. These criteria
are fulfilled by the docking/scoring benchmark set PDBbind core set.3,59,62 In our study, 17 PL complexes
(Figure 2 and Table 1) were used with targets
from diverse protein families: three enzyme classes (transferase,
hydrolase, and lyase), chaperone, and nuclear receptor (Table 1). The ligand structures are
shown in Figure 2.

Docking Poses
Ligand poses obtained by seven commonly
used docking programs were collected from previously published work.4 These programs were AutoDock (version 4.2.6),56 AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2),57 LeDock (version 1.0),63 UCSF
Dock (version 6.7),58 Glide SP (version
67011),55 Glide XP (version 67011),55 and Surflex Dock (version 2.706.13302).64 For each target, the ligand poses were pooled,
which amounted to approximately 350 poses per target. To reduce the
redundancy, all poses per target were clustered using the “cluster_conformer”
script in the Schrödinger suite65 with an RMSD cutoff of 0.5 Å. The number of poses was thus
reduced to approximately 250 poses per PL system. Each ligand pose,
as well as X-ray reference geometry, was scored “in-place”
using four classical SFs (AutoDock,56 AutoDock
Vina,57 UCSF Dock,58 and Glide XP55) and compared to that
of two variants of SQM/COSMO SFs, see below.23,52

Protein and Ligand Preparation
Protein Structure Preparation
Following the standard
virtual screening protocol,4 all the crystal
waters were removed from the PL complexes. As noted previously,23 physics-based SFs require special care in preparing
the PL structures. For all proteins, which were not deposited as monomers,
chain A was used for protein preparation except 10GS and 2XB8 where the dimer
interface makes important contributions to the binding. We used the
LEaP program, which is part of the AMBER14 suite,66 to protonate the proteins. The protonation state of histidine
residues was assigned manually on the basis of hydrogen-bonding patterns.
Cysteine disulfide bonds were assigned manually on the basis of the
sulfur–sulfur distance. In the case of the 3PE2 complex, the B conformation
of M163 was used because it forms interactions with the ligand. Hydrogen
atom positions in PL complexes were relaxed by the simulated annealing
protocol using short molecular dynamics (MD) (for details see Supporting Information).

Ligand Preparation
The protonation states of the ligands
were carefully checked by pKa calculations
at pH 7 using Schrödinger “Propka”.65 The collected docking poses from seven different
programs had different output file formats. Each ligand was made into
one common MOL2 file format without any changes in X, Y, and Z coordinates. Partial
charges were derived at the AM1-BCC level using RESP.67−69

RMSD Measurements
RMSD values of all the ligand poses
were calculated with respect to the corresponding X-ray geometry of
the ligand (without any further optimization) with the “heavy
atom” option using the “rmsd.py” script by Schrödinger.

Scoring
SQM/COSMO SFs
All of the docked PL complexes with close
contacts (cutoff of 1.5 Å) between the protein and the ligand
were relaxed by short AMBER/GB optimization as in previous studies.52 Next, optimal hydrogen positions were localized
in each complex using a short MDs run using AMBER/GB as in our previous
studies.52 The SQM/COSMO score is a sum
of ΔEint and ΔΔGsolv terms. For speed-up and without compromising
the reliability,23 the former term was
calculated on large parts of the protein (typically the ligand plus
10 Å protein surroundings) using two approaches: (i) the corrected
PM6-D3H4X44 and (ii) DFTB3-D3H4X method,
a third-order DFTB70,71 with the 3OB parameter set72,73 and the latest version of the D3H4X corrections for noncovalent
interactions.74 The solvation free energy
was calculated on the same truncated system as above using a COSMO
implicit solvent model at the PM6 level.40

Glide XP Score
All scoring calculations were performed
with Glide XP55 and run in the extra precision
(XP) workflow framework. Docking grids were generated by Glide using
the cocrystallized ligand at the center of the grid box. The compounds
were scored with the option “score in place only”.

AutoDock4 and AutoDock Vina
For both AutoDock456 and AutoDock Vina,57 the centers of grid boxes were arranged according to the centers
of the crystal ligand poses. The grid box sizes were adjusted to make
scoring possible for all combinations of ligands and conformations.
AM1-BCC RESP partial charges were used.

UCSF DOCK
The
grid spacing was 0.3 Å. The cutoff
for nonbonded interactions was not used. We used AMBER parameters.
For ligands, we used AM1-BCC RESP partial atomic charges.

Score Scaling
The scores of all the poses of the 17
PL complexes obtained by the 6 SFs were transformed into relative
numbers with respect to the score of the crystal pose and normalized
as done previously.23,52
