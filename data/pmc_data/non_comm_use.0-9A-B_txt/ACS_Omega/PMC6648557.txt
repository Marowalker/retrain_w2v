The direct conversion
of untreated microcrystalline cellulose into
C2–C3 alcohols, through a one-pot process
promoted by the heterogeneous bimetallic Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst, is presented. The process is selfsustainable without the
addition of external molecular hydrogen or acid/basic promoters and
is mainly selective toward ethanol. At 240 °C, a complete cellulose
conversion was reached after 12 h with an ethanol molar selectivity
of 51% among liquid products. The synergistic effect played by water
(which aids in the chemical pretreatment means of cellulose through
the hydrolysis process) and the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst
(which catalyzes the hydrogenolysis reaction driving the pattern of
obtained products) is elucidated.

1 Introduction
Nonedible
lignocellulosic biomasses, including recovered wastes
from agriculture and food industries, represent a powerful feedstock
for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals.1−5 At present, the most adopted technologies for the catalytic upgrading
of waste lignocellulosic feedstocks generally require the separation
of lignocellulose in its key constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin). An important class of these pretreatments are organosolv
processes in which the (very low) conversion of the cellulosic part
and the catalyst recycling have been recognized as key tasks to be
tackled.6,7 In this context, the valorization of cellulose,
the main constituent of lignocellulosics, plays a crucial role for
its catalytic upgrade.8,9 Several strategies to transform
cellulose into valuable products have been investigated. However,
the heterogeneously catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose is still a challenging
process because a solid–solid reaction needs to be activated,
the polymer being insoluble in water or other common reaction media;10−12 for this reason, acid or basic additives are quite often used.10−15 Furthermore, deoxygenative processes (hydrogenolysis), through the
breaking of C–O, C–C, C–H, and O–H bonds,
allow the reduction of the oxygen content in lignocellulosic biomasses
with the simultaneous addition of H2.16 Therefore, it can be possible to promote, in a unique step,
the conversion of cellulose into short polyols and alcohols, through
the tandem hydrolysis/hydrogenolysis reaction, which is considered
as a key tool to obtain high-value added products starting from biomass-based
feedstocks.17−19 In this regard, since one of the main drawbacks of
the cellulose hydrogenolysis process is closely related to the use
of high-pressure molecular hydrogen (some examples of metal catalysts
applied to the conversion of cellulose in the presence of molecular
H2 are reported in Table S1),
which limits the application of such a process because of economical
and safety reasons, the use of an indirect H-source has been generally
proposed. At present, probably one of the best approaches, suggested
by Fukuoka and co-workers, involves the use of 2-propanol as an indirect
H-source for the production of hexitols from cellulose.19,20 Moreover, to favor the conversion of the microcrystalline cellulose
(MCC) into useful chemicals, a physicochemical pretreatment to break
down its robust structure is generally required to make cellulose
more suitable for its catalytic conversion.21−23 However, these
pretreatments present important limitations in terms of time and sustainability
of the valorization process. Therefore, the ideal approach is to use
unpretreated cellulose as the starting material, avoiding, at the
same time, the use of acid or basic additives having more efficient
and less costly catalytic processes.

In this work, we present
a simple heterogeneous catalytic process
for the conversion of cellulose into ethanol, avoiding energy-intensive
pretreatment, high initial hydrogen pressure, special solvents, or
harsh hydrolysis conditions. The reactivity of unpretreated microcrystalline
cellulose under an inert atmosphere (self-hydrolysis/hydrogenolysis
conditions) in the presence of the coprecipitated Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst for the sustainable production of ethanol
is highlighted. Water was used as a green reaction solvent, and under
the adopted reaction conditions, it was able to promote, through its
autoprotolysis reaction, the in situ hydrolytic pretreatment of cellulose
favoring its further reductive conversion.

The heterogeneous
Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst used
in this study was efficiently employed by different research groups
in several processes for the reductive upgrading of cellulose-, hemicellulose-,
and lignin-derived molecules.24−45 The most significant physicochemical peculiarities of the catalyst,
prepared by the coprecipitation technique, have been already reported
and can be summarized as follows: (i) partially positively charged
palladium nanoparticles, having an average particle size ranging from
1 to 2 nm, well dispersed into the Fe3O4 support27−4327−43 and (ii) the existence of Pd–Fe bimetallic clusters on the
catalyst surface (characterized by a shorter scattering Pd–Fe
path of 2.51 Å with respect to the Pd–Pd distance of about
2.70 Å34−37).

2 Results and Discussion
At the beginning of
our investigation, the commercially available
microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was mechanically pretreated, with
the aim to reduce the crystallinity index (CrI%). A ball-milling process
of 3 h at 400 rpm was sufficient to reduce the index of crystallinity
at a value of 12%, starting from that of 92% for the MCC used (Figure S1).

The hydrogenolysis of the ball-milled
cellulose (BMC) was studied
in the temperature range of 180–240 °C, using a very low
initial pressure of 5 bar of H2, within 24 h of reaction,
in presence of the prereduced bimetallic Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst (Table S2, entries 1–3).
The hydrogenolysis of BMC reached a significant value even at the
lowest temperature investigated (60% at 180 °C), and became complete
at 210 °C. As the temperature increases, the product distribution
is directed toward ethanol formation, which becomes the main reaction
product in the liquid phase at 240 °C, reaching a molar selectivity
of 65%. Other minor products, including other alcohols (n-butanol, methanol) and acids (acetic acid, lactic acid, butanoic
acid) were also detected.

As expected, on using the unpretreated
microcrystalline cellulose
(MCC) as the starting material, minor conversions were registered
at lower temperatures (180 and 210 °C), whereas at 240 °C,
a full conversion was obtained (Table S2, entries 4–6). Upon increasing the initial H2 pressure
up to 20 bar, the reaction proceeded to a complete MCC conversion,
whereas a slight change in the product selectivity was registered
(Table S2, entry 7).

Afterward, to
overcome the limitation related to the use of molecular
hydrogen, the unpretreated microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was directly
processed in the presence of the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst
under an inert atmosphere (Table 1, entries 1–4). Surprisingly, a complete MCC
conversion was registered at 240 °C, obtaining ethanol as the
main product in the liquid phase (58% molar selectivity). The pattern
of products appears unchanged with respect to that obtained in the
presence of molecular hydrogen, although at lower conversion values
of MCC (10, 21, and 86% at 150, 180, and 210 °C, respectively).
Together with diols and alcohols, in the presence of the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst, a small amount of acids (mainly acetic
acid), probably derived from the degradation of cellulose sugars,46 is always registered.

In general, the distribution of products in the liquid
phase closely
resembles the performance observed in the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol
and other cellulose-derived C5–C3 polyols
promoted by the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst, where it
was demonstrated that the reaction pattern involves a preliminary
dehydrogenation, followed by decarbonylation and retro-aldol reactions,
subsequently followed by a series of hydrogenolitic cascade reactions,
which lead to the high selectivity of ethanol.39,44

In agreement with studies conducted by Palkovits and co-workers
on the hydrogenolysis of cellulose over a Cu-based catalyst,47 we propose a reaction mechanism in which the
terminal glucose (preliminary data related to glucose conversion at
240 °C in the presence and the absence of molecular H2 are reported in Table S3) is converted
into sorbitol via a hydrolysis/hydrogenation reaction. Sorbitol is
then rapidly (100% conversion in 3 h at 240 °C) converted into
ethanol. Other reaction mechanisms, generally proposed in the hydrogenolysis
of cellulose (e.g., the glucose or fructose retro-aldol condensation
route), should be discarded in the light of the observed reaction
products. However, further investigations are currently in progress
to fully elucidate all reactions involved in the hydrolysis/hydrogenolysis
of cellulose both in the presence and in the absence of the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst.

Results obtained both in the
presence and in the absence of added
hydrogen highlight that under the adopted operating conditions, it
is not necessary to pretreat the microcrystalline cellulose.

Indeed, under the reaction conditions adopted, water is in a quasi-subcritical
state, and thus, having a higher concentration of protonic species,
it is able to catalyze the initial hydrolytic step of cellulose.48,49 This effect is more evident at a higher temperature, such as 240
°C, with cellulose becoming more available for the following
steps of hydrogenolysis, promoted by the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst.

To corroborate this hypothesis, in a reference experiment,
MCC
was allowed to react in the absence of any catalyst (240 °C,
24 h, 5 bar of initial N2 pressure). Cellulose-derived
sugars were obtained as the main reaction products with an overall
MCC conversion of 66% (Figure 1). Moreover, the presence of acetic acid as a reaction product,
which progressively increases on increasing the reaction temperature
(Figure S2), confirms its derivation from
thermal degradation processes or oxidative sugar decomposition catalyzed
by water at high temperatures.

Figure 1 Comparison of high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) chromatograms
of MCC conversion in the presence of the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst (green profile) or in the absence of a catalyst (gray profile)
at 240 °C (reaction conditions: catalyst (when used) 0.25 g;
60 mL solution of MCC (4 wt %); solvent, water; initial N2 pressure, 5 bar; stirring, 500 rpm).

It should be noted that in experiments carried out in the
presence
of the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst, solutions were colorless.
Furthermore, to confirm the absence of coke formation from the cellulose
thermal decomposition, the used catalyst was filtered, washed with
deionized water, dried overnight at 120 °C, and characterized
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)–differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) analysis (Figure S3), where the typical
combustion peak of coke above 500 °C was not observed. On the
other hand, when the reaction was carried out in the absence of a
catalyst, a light orange/brown solution was obtained, suggesting that
some degradation or condensation products may be formed. However,
these products were not identified and/or quantified.

At the
same time, the formation of liquid-phase products typical
of reductive processes in experiments carried out in the absence of
added hydrogen poses the question of the origin of the necessary hydrogen
for hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reactions.

It is worth to underline
that the hydrogen necessary for hydrogenolysis
processes arises from the in situ aqueous phase reforming (APR) of
cellulose-derived sugars and polyols26,50,51  In
this regard, the analysis of the gas phase
relative to the reaction carried out at 240 °C under self-hydrolysis/hydrogenolysis
conditions reveals a composition that includes mainly H2 (another important feedstock for biorefineries) and CO2 and only scarce traces of C3–C1 alkanes.
The absence of CO, in gas-phase products, confirms the well-known
high efficiency of Pd/Fe3O4 toward the water
gas shift reaction.39,43

The time effect on the
conversion of MCC, under an inert atmosphere
at 240 °C, is reported in Figure 2 and Table S4. An impressive
MCC conversion is observed even after 3 h of reaction (73%) and it
is completed after 12 h. As the reaction proceeds, the quantity of
C3 and C2 polyols progressively decreases as
a result of further hydrogenolysis/APR processes. At all investigated
reaction times, ethanol is always the main product in the liquid phase.

Figure 2 Time effect
on the product distribution obtained in MCC conversion
(%) and ethanol molar selectivity in liquid-phase products (%), when
the reaction is carried out in the presence of N2 at 240
°C (3–48 h).

Finally, the unicity of the Pd/Fe3O4 system
in promoting the conversion of unpretreated cellulose under selfsustainable
hydrolysis/hydrogenolysis conditions into ethanol was proved by comparing
its catalytic activity with those of Pd/C and Fe3O4 benchmark catalysts (Table 1 and Figure S4). A complete
MCC conversion and a high selectivity of ethanol were obtained only
in the presence of the bimetallic Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst.
In analogy with our previous studies on the C6–C2 polyols, the peculiar reactivity of Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst is ascribable to the presence of bimetallic ensembles
that act as the active phase and are responsible for the pattern of
observed products.43

3 Conclusions
In summary, on the whole, the reactivity of the coprecipitated
bimetallic Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst applied to the
conversion of both pretreated (BMC) and unpretreated (MCC) cellulose
into short polyols and C2–C3 alcohols
has been investigated. The possibility of converting microcrystalline
cellulose in a selfsustainable, one-pot hydrolysis/hydrogenolysis
process with the liquid phase mainly constituted of ethanol has been
demonstrated. The process is performed under neutral conditions, without
any chemical–physical pretreatment, no added molecular hydrogen,
and/or further addition of acid or basic substances. Moreover, a synergistic
role played by water (which, under the operating conditions, favors
its autoprotolysis, by itself serving as a pretreatment means allowing
the hydrolytic step) and the Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst
(which activates the hydrogenolysis driving the pattern of obtained
products) has been highlighted. Future studies will be focused on
increasing the ethanol yield by investigating the best reaction conditions
or by designing more selective and efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Pretreatment of Cellulose
The microcrystalline
cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, particle size 51 μm) was mechanically
pretreated by planetary ball milling (Mono Mill II, Fritsch) with
a speed of 400 rpm for 3 h; about 10 g of microcrystalline cellulose
(MCC) per run was treated.

Microcrystalline and ball-milled
celluloses were characterized through X-ray diffraction measurements,
performed at room temperature on a Philips X-Pert diffractometer by
using the Ni β-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418
nm) in the 2θ range of 20–80° at a scan speed of
0.5°/min. The crystallinity index (CrI%) was estimated through
the Segal method using the ratio of the height of the 002 peak (I002) and the height of the minimum (IAM), between the 002 and the 101 peaks,52−54 in agreement with the following equation 1  

4.2 Catalyst Preparation
All chemicals
were acquired from commercial suppliers and used without performing
any further purification.

The bimetallic Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst (a nominal Pd loading of 5 wt %) was prepared by
the coprecipitation synthetic method. The nitrate precursors of palladium
(PdNO3·H2O) and iron (Fe(NO3)3·H2O) were simultaneously added dropwise
to an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3).

The precipitated catalyst was filtered, washed, and dried
under
vacuum at 120 °C for 24 h. Finally, the catalyst was reduced
at 200 °C under a hydrogen flow for 2 h to obtain it in the reduced
form named Pd/Fe3O4.

The Pd/C catalyst
was used after the identical reduction process
adopted for Pd/Fe3O4.

4.3 Catalytic
Tests
Catalytic reactions
were performed in a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave (Parr Instruments)
at a stirring speed of 500 rpm. The vessel was charged with 40 mL
of an aqueous suspension containing 4% wt of cellulose and 0.25 g
of reduced catalyst; then, the reactor was purged at least three times
with N2 (99.9%). Subsequently, the desired pressure (5
bars of H2 or N2) was reached and finally the
reactor was heated at the reaction temperature (180–240 °C),
continuously monitored through a thermocouple fixed into the autoclave
and connected to the reactor controller, within the duration of the
test (up to 24 h). Afterward, the system was cooled down and, when
at room temperature, the pressure was released carefully, and the
liquid phase was analyzed.

The conversion of cellulose was determined
through the gravimetric method, considering the amount of solid cellulose
put at the beginning and the final amount of the solid recovered at
the end of the reaction on the basis of eq 2 2  The molar selectivity of each product detected
in the liquid phase was calculated following eq 3 3  The carbon balance at the end of each reaction
was confirmed by using a liquid Total Organic Carbon analyzer (Shimadzu
TOC-VCSH). Through the comparison of the carbon balance evaluated
by HPLC analysis and by measurements of the total organic carbon content,
the percentage of carbon loss in liquid phase has been estimated to
be lower than 5%. The total organic carbon of the gas phase, when
calculated, has been estimated as the difference between the “total
organic carbon” measurements before and after reactions. In
all experiments, the analytical results of the gas chromatography
(GC) analysis showed a carbon balance in the gas phase higher than
95%.

4.4 HPLC and GC/Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis
A quantitative analysis of products in the liquid phase was performed
using an off-line Shimadzu HPLC equipped with an Aminex HPX-87-H column.
Gas-phase products were analyzed with a GC (Agilent 7890A) equipped
with a molecular sieve column (Supelco, Porapak Q column 80/100 mesh)
and a capillary column (HP-PLOT/Q, internal diameter: 0.53 mm; length:
30 m; film thickness: 40 μm) linked with the TCD detector and
a capillary column (HP-Al, internal diameter: 0.53 mm; length: 50
m; film thickness: 15 μm) connected to an flame ionization detector.

Products in the liquid phase were also cross-checked by GC/MS analysis
with head space (HS)-GC/MS and HS-solid phase microextraction (SPME)–GC/MS
for the identification of volatile products in the head space, as
well as with GC/MS using the derivatized liquid sample. The derivatization
procedure was carried out by collecting 150 μL of a filtered
liquid sample (Millipore filter 0.22 μm) that was transferred
into a 1.5 mL vial and dried in a vacuum concentrator at room temperature.
Successively, to the dried sample, 40 μL of methoxyaminehydrochloride
(20 mg/mL in pyridine) was added. The solution was incubated in a
thermomixer (950 rpm) for 2 h at 37 °C to allow metoximation.
Successively, the metoximated sample was further silylated adding
70 μL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide
and incubating the solution for 30 min at 37 °C. The derivatized
sample (110 μL) was then transferred into a glass vial suitable
for GC/MS analysis. The extract after derivatization was injected
into a TG-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm)
using a Thermo Fisher gas chromatograph apparatus (Trace 1310) equipped
with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (ISQ LT); the gas carrier
was helium with a flow of 1 mL/min.

For GC/MS analysis of the
derivatized liquid samples, the injector
and source were settled at temperatures of 250 and 260 °C, respectively.
One microliter of the sample was injected in the splitless mode using
the following programmed temperature: isothermal 5 min at 70 °C
followed by a 5 °C/min ramp to 330 °C and a final 5 min
heating at 330 °C. Mass spectra were recorded in the electronic
impact (EI) mode at 70 eV, scanning in the 45–500 m/z range. The mass spectrometric solvent delay was
settled as 9 min. Metabolite identification was carried out by comparing
the mass spectra with reference spectra in mass spectral libraries
(NIST, mainlib, wiley8, wiley fragrances, Pflegrer Maurer Weber, Ehrenstorfer).

For HS-GC/MS and HS-SPME–GC/MS, samples were chemically
characterized using a Thermo Fisher gas chromatograph apparatus (Trace
1310) equipped with a single-quadrupole mass spectrometer (ISQ LT).
In particular, we used the technique of the head space, collecting
just the volatiles concentrated in the air space above the sample,
and the HS-SPME using a gray fiber (StableFlex, divinylbenzene/carboxen
on poly(dimethylsiloxane) coating; 50/30 μm coating; Supleco).
For the HS method, samples were incubated for 10 min at 40° and
1 μL of the head space was injected in the split mode with a
split ratio of 60. For the HS-SPME method, the sample was equilibrated
for 10 min at 40° and then the fiber was exposed to volatile
organic compounds for 20 min to allow the adsorption on the fiber
of a suitable and representative number of volatiles. The capillary
column was a TG-5MS, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, and
the gas carrier was helium with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injector
and source were settled at 200 and 260 °C, respectively. The
following temperature was programmed: isothermal for 7 min at 45 °C,
from 45 to 80 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min, from 80 to 200
°C with a rate of 20 °C/min, and then isocratic for 3 min
at 200 °C. Mass spectra were recorded in the electronic impact
(EI) mode at 70 eV, scanning in the 40–500 m/z range. For HS and HS-SPME, no solvent delay was
settled. Compound identification was carried out by comparing the
relative retention times and mass spectra of molecules with those
of the libraries (NIST 2005, Wiley 7.0 etc.).
