The FDA-approved
drug for the treatment of asthma, zafirlukast,
is synthesized engaging multiple catalytic reactions including a new
method for the construction of 3-aroylindoles via oxidative cyclization.
The highlights include transition-metal and peroxide free C–H
bond activation using the stoichiometric amount of sodium persulfate
as an oxidizing agent in the construction of 3-aroylindole, avoiding
transition metal, with over 28% overall yield. The complete process
has a turnaround time of 28 h to get the target molecule starting
from substituted aniline, with practically no protecting groups.

Introduction
Substituted indoles
play a pivotal role in drug discovery, culminating
in launch of several drugs, and many molecules are in clinical pipeline.1−5 The discovery and development of drugs to treat allergic conditions
and asthma has been of paramount importance in the pharmaceutical
industry.2 The success rate in this area
of research has been significant because the human intralobar airways
have a single receptor for peptido leukotrienes.6−8 There has been
a great progress reported in identifying selective peptide leukotriene
antagonists.9 Indole and indazole compounds
have been extensively studied as selective antagonists of the leukotriene
pathway.10−13 These efforts have culminated in launching zafirlukast (1) as the oral leukotriene receptor antagonist for the maintenance
treatment of asthma, prescribed in combination with bronchodilators
and steroids.14−23 Other marketed products which have indole skeleton are panobinostat
(2),24 roxindole (3),25,26 tropisetron (4),27,28 etc (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Representative
drugs with 3-substituted indoles.

Zafirlukast attracted our attention owing to its biological
profile
along with our own interest to develop new strategies to build heterocyclic
scaffolds for ongoing medicinal chemistry programmes.29−31 Traditionally, these classes of compounds are synthesized from prefabricated
indole which offers lesser flexibility in substitutions in the benzene
ring of indole.1

Thus, a nonconventional
strategy engaging indole construction as
the key step of synthesis, unlike using substituted indoles as starting
materials, was envisaged, thereby avoiding Fischer indole synthesis.
In this regard, we aimed at the synthesis of 3-aroylindoles owing
to easy manipulation of its carbonyl functionality. Few literature
representative methods for the synthesis of 3-aroylindoles have been
shown in Scheme 1.32−38 Recently, Patel et al. have reported an intramolecular copper-catalyzed
sp3 C–H activation followed by C–C and C–O
bond formation reactions to construct indole scaffold from alkynyl
aniline.36,37 Simultaneously, Liang and co-workers reported
a palladium–copper-cocatalyzed 3-aroylindole synthesis.38 We desired a peroxide-free and preferably transition
metal-free cyclization protocol which prompted us to explore various
oxidants to trigger the cyclization process of alkynyl N-methyl anilines to substituted indoles, which could in turn be transformed
to zafirlukast.

Scheme 1 Representative Methods for 3-Aroylindoles
Initially, easily accessible N,N-dimethyl-2-(phenylethynyl)aniline 5a(39) was subjected to sodium persulfate
catalyzed oxidation
to produce the indole 6a in 75% yield. The optimum yields
were obtained with three equivalents of sodium persulfate (see Table 1). After establishing
the optimized conditions, we studied the scope and generality of the
reaction with substituted N,N-dimethyl-2-(phenylethynyl)anilines 5 and obtained corresponding 3-aroylindoles (6a–e, Table 2) in good
yields (68–91%). In general, aryl rings substituted with electron-withdrawing
groups gave higher yields (6d, 91% yield) compared to
electron-donating groups. The procedure is also applicable to electron-rich
aniline 5e to give required product 6e in
60% yield. The scalability of this reaction is proved by the preparation
of 3-aroylindole 6d in a large scale.

The synthesis
of substituted indoles gave us the confidence to
choose molecules containing indole skeleton and we narrowed down our
search to zafirlukast. A retrosynthetic analysis of zafirlukast gave
the key intermediate 6f, which can be synthesized from
the alkyne 5f by extending our methodology. The alkyne
can in turn be synthesized from 2-bromoaniline 7 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Retrosynthetic Analysis
of Zafirlukast
To add value to this
reaction, appropriately substituted alkynyl
aniline derivative 5f was prepared in a one-pot three-step
process. 2-bromoaniline 7 was subjected to Sonogashira
coupling with trimethylsilyl-acetylene using palladium catalyst, followed
by desilylation with the addition of K2CO340 and subsequent Sonogashira coupling in the same
flask with methyl 4-iodo-3-methoxybenzoate 10 furnished 5f in 58% overall yield over three steps (Scheme 3). To our satisfaction, sodium
persulfate in hot dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in absence of any external
catalyst, facilitated the entire sequence of sp3 C–H
activation of N–Me group and formation of two new covalent
C–C and C–O bonds in excellent yield (88%), to generate
key intermediate 6f.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Zafirlukast
The task of converting 6f to zafirlukast was accomplished
following four easy synthetic transformations (Scheme 3). Initially, 6f was hydrogenated
with Pd/C and H2 which under acidic workup provided the
indole acid 8 in 76% yield.41 The coupling of indole acid 8 with sulphonamide 11 in the presence of ZnCl2 catalyst afforded 9 in 92% yield.42 The reduction
of the nitro group in 9 was accomplished with Ra–Ni
under a H2 atmosphere in EtOAc to yield 5-amino indole
derivative in quantitative yield. This was converted to zafirlukast
(1) by conjugating with cyclopentyl chloroformate 12 following reported procedure, using N-methyl
morpholine, in excellent yield (89%).

On the basis of literature
reports, a plausible mechanism has been
proposed for this transformation (Scheme 4). The aminyl radical cation A is formed by a single electron transfer process from the nitrogen
atom of the N,N-dimethyl-2-(phenylethynyl)aniline
(5). Abstraction of a hydrogen radical from N–Me
gives an iminium intermediate B. The intramolecular cyclization
of intermediate B via nucleophilic attack of the alkynyl
group at the iminium carbon and subsequent addition of sodium persulfate
gave enolate intermediate C. Then, ketonization of C afforded ketone D, which underwent further
oxidation to provide 3-arolyindole 6.

Scheme 4 Plausible Mechanism
In summary, an FDA-approved
drug zafirlukast is synthesized in
six steps starting from commercially available 2-bromo-N,N-dimethyl-4-nitroaniline engaging all catalytic
transformations and almost with no protective groups. The key features
are (i) one pot, three transformations to build biaryl alkynes, (ii)
overall yield of 28%, and (iii) all the six steps requiring only 28
h overall for completing the process, which constitutes a very fast
approach to the target.

General Details
General Information
All the reagents and solvents were
of reagent grade and used without purification unless specified otherwise.
All the dry reactions were performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen
in flame-dried or oven-dried glassware with magnetic stirring. For
reactions carried out using dry solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF),
DMSO, CH2Cl2, were freshly distilled over calcium
hydride and methanol was dried over calcium oxide. Technical grade
ethyl acetate and hexane used for column chromatography were distilled
prior to use. Column chromatography was carried out using silica gel
(60–120 and 100–200 mesh) packed in glass columns. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400, 500
and 100, 125 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported
in ppm, using the residual solvent peak in CDCl3 (H: δ
= 7.26 and C: δ = 77.16 ppm) as the internal standard, and coupling
constants (J) are given in Hz. High-resolution mass
spectra (HRMS) were obtained by electron spray ionization (ESI) using
an ESI-TOF mass spectrometer in positive ion mode (M + H or M + Na)
as indicated.

Cyclopentyl(3-(2-methoxy-4-((o-tolylsulfonyl)carbamoyl)benzyl)-1-methyl-1H-indol-5-yl)carbamate (1)
A solution
of N-{3-methyl-4-(N-methyl-5-nitro-1H-3-indolyl)methyl benzoyl}-2-methyl-1-benzenesulfonamide 9 (100 mg, 0.20 mmol) in MeOH (2 mL) and Ra–Ni (2 mg,
5 mol %) was placed under hydrogen balloon pressure at room temperature
for 2 h. The reaction mass was filtered through a celite bed, and
the catalyst was washed with diethyl ether (2 × 10 mL); the combined
filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure and dried using
high vacuum for 1 h. The obtained residue and N-methyl
morphine (26 μL, 0.24 mmol) were dissolved in DCM (2 mL), and
then, cyclopentyl chloroformate was added slowly (25 μL, 0.20
mmol) in 0 °C. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at
room temperature for 3 h. After completion of the reaction, the solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the solid precipitate was
washed with water (5 mL) and then extracted with DCM (10 mL) and dried
over sodium sulfate and evaporated in under reduced pressure. The
crude compound was purified by column chromatography to afford title
