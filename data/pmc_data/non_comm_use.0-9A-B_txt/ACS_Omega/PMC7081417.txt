Super-dry
reforming of methane (CH4 + 3CO2 → 2H2O + 4CO) is a very promising route for CO2 utilization.
To maximize the yield of CO, a water–gas
shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) should be circumvented. Combination of dry reforming of
methane, redox reactions (metal oxide is reduced by CO and H2 in one step and then oxidized by CO2 in the next step),
and CO2 sorption in a fixed-bed reactor was proposed as
a potential approach to suppress the water–gas shift reaction.
It was demonstrated that this isothermal operation can produce two
separate streams, one is rich in steam and the other in CO, in a redox
cycle at 750 °C. However, both the thermodynamic analysis and
experimental investigations suggest that steam- and CO-rich streams
may not be produced sequentially in the redox mode at 750 °C.

1 Introduction
Currently,
net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from
human activities including not only energy and industrial production
but also land use and agriculture continuously increase. As a result,
the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is rising drastically
more than ever in Earth’s history.1,2 This
will have adverse impacts on Earth’s climate and human civilization.3−8 An attractive strategy of mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions is to capture and subsequently transform it into economically
viable chemicals or fuels.9−12 Carbon dioxide can be directly used as a feedstock
to produce commodities, such as urea, polycarbonate polyols, methanol
(a platform chemical for a range of other reaction pathways), and
hydrocarbons.13−18 The former two routes have been commercialized; the others are technically
possible but have not been widely adopted. As an alternative approach,
carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide (CO) and then converted
to oxygenates or hydrocarbons.

The reduction of CO2 to CO, the first step toward the
synthesis of carbon-based chemicals and fuels, can be achieved through
a thermochemical pathway, for example, thermal decomposition of CO2 (CO2 → CO + 0.5O2). One typical
process involves a two-step, cyclic redox scheme where a metal oxide
first decomposes in an inert environment to release its lattice oxygen
(MOx → MOx–δ + 0.5δO2) at elevated temperatures
(>1200 °C), and subsequently, the reduced oxide is put in
contact
with CO2 to replenish its lattice oxygen, producing carbon
monoxide (MOx–δ + δCO2 → MOx + δCO). A
major challenge of thermochemical processes resides in the high reduction
temperature, which can be lowered by introducing a reducing agent.19 In such an open-loop thermochemical approach,
the reducing agent acts as an oxygen “sink” to facilitate
lattice oxygen extraction from the metal oxide.

Methane (CH4) is an attractive reducing agent because
it is the predominant component of natural gas, which is abundant
and accessible. At the end of 2018, the global proven natural gas
reserves stood at 196.9 trillion cubic meters,20 which do not include those entrapped in gas hydrates at
the continental slopes of oceans and in permafrost regions. It was
estimated that the amount of natural gas stored in gas hydrates is
between 1000 and 5000 trillion cubic meters.21 To efficiently utilize CH4 for CO2 conversion,
Buelens et al. proposed super-dry forming of methane (the global reaction
is CH4 + 3CO2 → 2H2O + 4CO).22 They demonstrated that methane and CO2 (molar ratio of CH4/CO2 is 1:3) are converted
to water and CO in a dual-bed reactor under a redox mode at 750 °C.21 In this scheme, dry reforming of methane (eq 1) occurs over a Ni-based
catalyst in the first bed (methane is almost completely converted)
followed by hydrogen/CO oxidation (eq 2) over an Fe-based redox material that is coupled with
the CO2 reaction with supported CaO (eq 3) in the second bed. Because of negligible
CO2 at the outlet of the reactor, the main product is water
in this step that lasted for about 26 s. Subsequently, the reactor
was purged with helium. Carbon dioxide, resulting from calcium carbonate
decomposition (eq 4),
oxidizes the reduced iron oxide, producing pure CO (eq 5). This step lasted for around 34
s. The above two steps form a closed loop. It was claimed that this
redox mode avoids loss in the CO yield caused by the water–gas
shift reaction (eq 6),
giving rise to a higher CO2 utilization efficiency. In
a complete redox cycle, the overall reaction in the second bed is
the reverse water–gas shift reaction (eq 7). 1   2   3   4   5   6   7  

As shown in the article (hereafter,
the article refers to ref (22)), the instantaneous H2O/H2 molar
ratio in the reduction step is much
greater than 1, corresponding to a hydrogen to water conversion of
well above 50%. In the oxidation step, the instantaneous CO/CO2 molar ratio was higher than 1, suggesting that the conversion
of CO2 to CO is also above 50%. These observations indicate
that an Fe-based redox material favors both hydrogen oxidation and
CO2 splitting at 750 °C. Regarding the important implication
of the above findings for CO2 utilization, we conducted
a detailed thermodynamic analysis of redox reactions. The analysis
results, together with experimental investigations, demonstrate that
hydrogen oxidation and CO2 splitting cannot be both favorable
in the redox cycle at 750 °C.

2 Results
and Discussion
The instantaneous H2O/H2 or CO/CO2 molar ratio can be used to estimate the partial
pressure of oxygen
(PO2) of redox materials located
at the outlet of the reactor because neither water nor H2 reacts with CO2 sorbents in the second bed. Before doing
that, we constructed the Ellingham diagram, a plot of the standard
Gibbs free-energy change of reaction (ΔGr0) versus temperature. The ΔGr0 values of CO and H2 oxidations
were calculated by HSC Chemistry,23 and
the results along with the oxygen partial pressure PO2 are presented in Figure 1. The solid lines represent the variation
of ΔGr0 with temperature,
and the dashed lines mark the variation of ΔμO2 with temperature. For a specific oxygen pressure, ΔμO2 is calculated by the following equation 8  where R is
the gas constant (J/mol K), μO2 is the
chemical potential of oxygen at T and PO2 (kJ/mol), T is the temperature
(K), PO2 is the oxygen pressure
(atm), and μO20 is the chemical potential of oxygen at T and P0 (kJ/mol), P0=1 atm.

Figure 1 Standard Gibbs energy change of CO and H2 oxidations
at 1 atm and ΔμO2 of different oxygen
partial pressures at temperatures of 600–900 °C.

For the oxidation of hydrogen (eq 9), the equilibrium oxygen pressure
is given by eq 11. 9   10  where ΔGr90 is the
standard Gibbs energy change of hydrogen oxidation (kJ/mol) and Keq is the equilibrium constant. 11  If hydrogen conversion to
water in the reduction step is greater than 1 (), then 12   13  

Thus, ΔμO2 resides in the
red
zone at temperatures below 815 °C (Figure 1). On the other hand, if the conversion of
water to hydrogen conversion in the oxidation step is greater than
1, then ΔμO2 < ΔGr90. The above arguments are true for CO oxidation and CO2 splitting. For any redox material, its equilibrium oxygen pressure
(or chemical potential of lattice oxygen) is only determined by the
oxidation state at a given temperature whether it is in the reduction
step or oxidation step. That is to say, ΔμO2 cannot be both greater than ΔGr0 in the reduction
and less than ΔGr0 in the oxidation step for the same oxidation
state. Therefore, one can estimate the equilibrium oxygen pressure
from the molar ratio of H2O to H2 in the reduction
step and then the molar ratio of CO to CO2 in the oxidation
step. For hydrogen oxidation by a redox material with an equilibrium
oxygen pressure residing in the red zone of Figure 1, the conversion of hydrogen
to water (or CO to CO2) is greater than 1 in the reduction
step but water (or CO2) splitting is thermodynamically
unfavorable in the oxidation. If the equilibrium oxygen pressure of
redox materials resides in the yellow zone of Figure 1, then both hydrogen oxidation and CO2 splitting is thermodynamically favorable. It should be noted
that the above statements are independent of the nature (pure, doped,
nanosized, etc.) of oxygen carriers. The nature of oxygen carriers
only determines where the chemical potential of lattice oxygen resides
in Figure 1 and thus,
which reaction is favorable (maximum conversion of gas reactants is
greater than 50%) in the redox reactions. At a specific temperature,
the chemical potential of lattice oxygen of oxygen carriers is fixed,
no matter whether they are reduced or oxidized in the chemical looping
processes.

For the overall redox reaction (eq 7) in the second bed, the equilibrium constant
at 750
°C is given by eq 14 (the gas mixture is assumed to be ideal gas) 14  If  > 1
in the reduction (with respect to the
redox material) step, then  < 1 in the oxidation step at 750 °C.
It should be noted that this argument is independent of redox materials
prepared by different methods and makes no assumption of the kinetic
feasibility of the variation reactions as long as other materials
not considered in overall redox reaction are net consumed or generated.
Thus, in both ways, it is demonstrated that the  and  cannot be both
more than 1 at the same
time at 750 °C.

Based on the above argument, the molar
ratio of CO/CO2 in the oxidation step is below 1 (or greater
than 1) if the molar
ratio of H2O/H2 in the reduction is above 1
(or less than 1) at 750 °C because the CO2 sorbent
does not affect the thermodynamics of redox reactions at this temperature.
However, the cumulative molar ratios of CO/CO2 and H2O/H2 are 2.67 and 18 (Table S3 in ref (24)). It seems that neither instantaneous nor cumulative data reported
in the article is consistent with the thermodynamic analysis if the
reported data is reliable (Figure 3 and Table S3 in refs (22) and (24), respectively). To further
verify that H2 to water conversion in the reduction step
and CO2 to CO conversion in the oxidation cannot be both
higher than 50% in one redox cycle, we prepared 50Fe2O3/MgAl2O4 composites by the sol–gel
method, and the redox performance was tested in a fixed-bed tubular
reactor made of quartz.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals
that hematite is the predominant
crystalline phase but the diffraction patterns of MgAl2O4 are absent in the as-prepared sample (Figure S2). Scanning electron micrographs demonstrate that
particles of as-prepared redox materials are irregular and Fe2O3 is well dispersed in the MgAl2O4 matrix (Figure S3).

In the
first run, 0.1 g of the redox material was loaded into the
reactor. From a fully (CO2) oxidized state, 10 consecutive
pulses of H2 were injected into the reactor through the
loop followed by 10 consecutive pulses of CO2. As shown
in Figure 2, H2 to water conversion monotonically decreases with the pulse
number, for example, it is 0.99, 0.56, and 0.46 for the 1st, 5th,
and 10th pulse, respectively. Also, it appears that H2 conversion
approaches a plateau after 5 pulses. Correspondingly, the cumulative
reduction degree as a function of the pulse number is shown in Figure S4. After 10 pulses of H2,
it reaches 26.4%. Over the next 10 consecutive CO2 pulses,
CO2 to CO conversion is below 0.35 and it monotonically
decreases with the pulse number (Figure 3). Based on the above
discussion, if H2 to water conversion is below 0.5 in the
reduction step, then CO2 to CO conversion should be above
0.5 in the oxidation step. This is inconsistent with what we observed
in H2-CO2 pulsing experiments (Figure 3). One possibility is that
the redox reactions are too slow to reach equilibrium at the above
gas hourly space velocity. To verify that, we loaded 1.0 g of redox
materials into the reactor and repeated the above experiment.

oxidized state at 750 °C: 0.1 g of Fe2O3/MgAl2O4, FAr =
50 STP mL/min, 10 consecutive pulses of 0.55 mL of H2 followed
by 10 consecutive pulses of 0.55 mL of CO2 at
ambient conditions.

Figure 3 Conversion of H2 and CO2 with a fully (H2) reduced state at
750 °C: 1.0 g of Fe2O3/MgAl2O4, FAr = 50 STP mL/min, 10
consecutive pulses of 0.55 mL of CO2 followed by 10 consecutive
pulses of 0.55 mL of H2 at
ambient conditions.

Starting from a fully
(H2) reduced state, 10 consecutive
pulses of CO2 followed by 10 consecutive pulses of H2 were injected into the reactor at 750 °C. Over 10 pulses,
CO2 to CO conversion is about 0.8 and H2 to
water conversion is around 0.24 (Figure 3). These observations are consistent with
the thermodynamic predictions.

Starting from a partial (CO2) oxidized state, 5 consecutive
pulses of H2 followed by 5 consecutive pulses of CO2 were injected. Over 10 pulses, H2 is completely
oxidized and CO2 splitting is negligible (Figure S5). After H2-CO2 pulsing, additional
40 consecutive pulses of H2 were injected, resulting in
a partial reduced state (Figure S6). Subsequently,
10 consecutive pulses of H2 followed by 10 consecutive
pulses of CO2 were injected. We found that H2 conversion monotonically decreases from 0.56 to 0.27 and CO2 conversion monotonically decreases from 0.61 to 0.44 (Figure 4). The findings are
consistent with the thermodynamic predictions.

state at 750 °C: 1.0 g of Fe2O3/MgAl2O4, FAr = 50 STP mL/min,
10 consecutive pulses of 0.55 mL H2 followed
by 10 consecutive pulses of 0.55 mL CO2 at ambient conditions.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
if H2 oxidation is favorable in the reduction
step (nH2O/nH2 > 1), then CO2 splitting is
unfavorable
in the oxidation step (nCO/nCO2 < 1) at a constant temperature below
815 °C. However, in the yellow zone of the Ellingham diagram,
the equilibrium conversion of both H2 to water and CO2 to CO can be higher than 50%. This is independent of the
presence of a CO2 adsorbent because it has no effect on
the partial pressure of oxygen of redox materials but may affect the
oxidation of CO in the reduction step because of in situ sorption
of CO2. Thus, two product streams, one is rich in steam
and the other in CO, cannot be obtained sequentially in the chemical
looping super-dry reforming scheme at 750 °C. Also, it was reported
that the lattice oxygen could not be totally replenished after carbonate
decomposition was complete, and extra CO2 was fed to the
reactor after the oxidation step in each redox cycle. To close the
loop, this extra CO2 will significantly reduce the yield
of CO (yCO = nCO,produced/(nCH4 + CO2, fed)) because CO2 conversion is relatively
low after the oxidation step. However, the amount of extra CO and
CO2 was not reported in the article. Therefore, the CO
yield remains unknown.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of 50Fe2O3/MgAl2O4
The chemicals used in preparing
50Fe2O3/MgAl2O4 were Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (99.0% purity), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (98.5% purity), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (99.0% purity), citric
acid (99.5% purity), and ethylene glycol (99.0% purity). All chemicals
were purchased from SINOPHARM and used as received without further
purification. For the synthesis of 50Fe2O3/MgAl2O4 composites (50 wt % Fe2O3), 9.01 g of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O,
25.30 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 26.37
g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and 80.73
g of C6H8O7 (CA) were dissolved into
80 mL of DI water (CA/cations = 2.5). The solution was heated up to
40 °C under agitation (600 rpm) and maintained at this temperature
for 30 min. Afterward, 39.12 g of ethylene glycol (EG) was added to
the above solution (EG/CA = 1.5). The temperature of the resulting
solution was increased to 80 °C and maintained at this temperature
until a gel formation. After that, the gel was dried at 120 °C
for 12 h to evaporate the residual water. Subsequently, it was treated
at 400 °C in air. Finally, the precursor was calcined at 800
°C in air for 12 h.

4.2 Characterization
The crystalline
phase of composites was examined by XRD that was performed on a D/Max-R
diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ
= 0.15406 nm). The operating voltage and current of diffractometer
were 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The morphology of the sample was
investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a TESCAN MALA3
LMH scanning electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage
of 5–15 kV. Samples for SEM were dusted onto an adhesive conductive
carbon belt attached to the sample holder.

4.3 Redox
Performance
The redox performance
of composites was evaluated in an in-house reactor unit (Figure S1). The sample was loaded into a quartz
reactor that was vertically placed in an electric furnace (OTF-1200X,
HF-Kejing), and the temperature of the reactor was ramped up to 750
°C at 10 °C/min in 100 STP mL/min of Ar (99.999 vol %).
The test started from a fully (H2) reduced state or a fully
(CO2) oxidized state of the sample. To start from a fully
(H2) reduced state, once the temperature reached the targeted
value, argon was switched to a gas mixture of 10 vol % hydrogen (99.999
vol %) balanced with argon (100 STP mL/min). This pretreatment lasted
for 30 min that was long enough to reduce hematite completely at the
above temperature. To start from a fully (CO2) oxidized
state, after the sample was completely reduced by H2, the
feed was switched to a gas mixture of 50 vol % CO2 (99.999
vol.%) balanced with argon (100 STP mL/min) and lasted until no CO
was detected in the effluent stream. After the sample was fully reduced
or oxidized, the bed was purged with 50 STP mL/min of Ar for 30 min.
Then, CO2 or H2 was injected into the reactor
(carried by argon) through a 6-way valve with a 0.55 mL injection
loop. The intervals between each H2 and CO2 injection
are 12 min and 6.5 min, respectively. In the pulsing experiments,
the flow rate of argon was maintained at 50 STP mL/min. The flow rates
of all gases were controlled by mass flow controllers (KM3100, Alicat),
and the composition of the effluent stream was monitored by an online
mass spectrometer (OmniStar GSD 320, Pfeiffer). The conversion of
H2 (or CO2) was calculated from the peak area
of H2 (or CO2) on the elution profiles.

Starting from a full (CO2) oxidation state, the reduction
degree of the redox materials during H2 pulsing was calculated
as follows 15   16  where i represents
the H2 pulse number. ni is
the molar number of H2 injected of the ith pulse, and Xi is the H2 conversion of the ith pulse. mFe3O4 is the mass of Fe3O4 in the full CO2 oxidized samples
(total conversion of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 was assumed). ri represents
the reduction degree of the ith pluse. n is the total number of H2 pulses, and r represents the reduction degree after the nth pulse.
