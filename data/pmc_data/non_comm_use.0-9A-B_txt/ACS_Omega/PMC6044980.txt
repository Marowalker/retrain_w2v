Early diagnosis of
dopamine and serotonin metabolic defects is
of importance notably because of the availability of therapeutic strategies
able to prevent the associated progressive brain dysfunction. The
diagnosis of these diseases relies on the determination of monoamine
metabolites and pterins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Current methods
involve at least two high-performance liquid chromatography runs of
CSF analysis. The first one is devoted to the quantification of dopamine
and serotonin metabolites and the second one to the quantification
of pterins. Here, we describe a single-step method to measure monoamine
neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins of interest in less than
10 min by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to sequential
coulometric oxidation and fluorescence detections. All target compounds
were quantified in CSF with a small volume (50 μL) and a single
filtration step for sample preparation and analysis. After validation,
the proposed method was applied to the determination of age-related
reference ranges in the CSF of target compounds from a series of 1372
samples collected in France from 2008 to 2014. In the same period,
the results obtained for 19 CSF samples from patients with known neurotransmitter
disorders and 115 CSF samples with known immune system activation
confirmed the expected pattern of changes in monoamine metabolites
and pterins.

Introduction
Since
the description of the Segawa syndrome, also known as dihydroxy-phenyl-alanine
(DOPA)-responsive dystonia, several neurotransmitter-inherited metabolic
disorders including biosynthesis, breakdown, or transport defects
of dopamine and serotonin have been reported.1−3 Inherited defects
leading to these metabolic diseases have been described or predicted
at the level of each enzyme involved in the metabolism of dopamine
and serotonin (Figure 1).1−3

(dashed arrows: nonenzymatic).

Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor of aromatic amino
acid
hydroxylases, plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of dopamine and
serotonin (Figure 1).4−6 Hence, defects in the biosynthesis or regeneration of BH4 result
in several dopamine and serotonin metabolic disorders. Each of these
conditions exhibits a characteristic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile
of dopamine and serotonin precursors and metabolites (Table 1).4−6

DTDS (dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome).

As BH4 is also the cofactor of phenylalanine
hydroxylase (Figure 1), BH4 deficiencies
can be detected at the time of newborn screening except for autosomal
dominant GTPCH deficiencies, certain cases of heterozygote GTPCH deficiencies,
and autosomal recessive SR deficiencies, which do not lead to hyperphenylalaninemia
(Table 1).4−6

Early diagnosis of dopamine and serotonin metabolic disorders
is
of importance notably because some of these diseases can be well-treated.7−9 In addition to the determination of CSF neurotransmitter metabolites,
the etiological diagnosis of these inherited disorders also requires
the determination of pterins in CSF, notably dihydroneopterin (NH2),
the precursor of BH4, and 7,8-dihyrobiopterin (BH2), the stable oxidized
form of the latter (Figure 1, Table 1).1−6

To sum it up, the differential diagnosis of dopamine and serotonin
metabolic disorders requires the determination of homovanillic acid
(HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 3-ortho-methyl-di-hydroxyphenylalanine (3-OMD), 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTrp),
NH2, and BH2 in the CSF (Table 1). To this purpose, current methods require at least two chromatographic
steps of CSF analysis. The first one is devoted to the quantification
of dopamine and serotonin metabolites and the second one to the quantitation
of pterins.10−19

As dopamine and serotonin metabolites are oxidizable compounds,
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical
detection (HPLC-ECD) is commonly used to quantify them in the CSF.10−17 More recently, some liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) methods have also been implemented.19,20 On the other hand, the CSF pterin concentrations are in the low
nM range at basal levels. Thus, their direct quantification does require
an HPLC method coupled to fluorescence or MS detections.1,10,11,17,19

Here, we describe a single-step ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography
(UHPLC) method for the rapid diagnosis of dopamine and serotonin metabolic
disorders. Neurotransmitter metabolites as well as pterins of interest
are determined in a single step in less than 10 min by UHPLC coupled
to sequential electrochemical and fluorescence detections.

After
validation, the proposed method requiring only a single filtration
step for sample preparation and analysis was applied to the analysis
of a series of 1650 CSF samples including several cases of known neurotransmitter
disorders and known immune system activation.

Results and Discussion
Method
Development
Preliminary HPLC separations were
achieved using the same polar-embedded C18 column (4.6 × 150
mm, 3 μm, and Atlantis T3) previously used for the separation
of neurotransmitter metabolites17 and pterins.18 In contrast to classical Si-C18 columns, this
stationary phase allows the separation of polar compounds including
both neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins without using an ion-pairing
reagent.18

Systematic investigation
of the effects of pH, mobile phase composition, and temperature allowed
us to obtain a separation with high efficiency and high resolution
of all target compounds in less than 50 min (Figure S1A). High resolution is mandatory for the specific ECD and
quantification of neurotransmitter metabolites because real CSF samples
exhibit several unknown additional peaks (Figure S1C). The electrochemical detector also served as a postcolumn
coulometric oxidation reactor for the oxidation of reduced pterins
prior to sequential fluorescence detection (Figure S1B,D). Hence, this method allows the simultaneous separation
of both neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins in a final run time
of 50 min.

To speed up the separation, we converted the HPLC
method to UHPLC.
For this purpose, we used an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 ×
100 mm and 1.8 μm) with the same mobile phase as for the HPLC
separation, delivered at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at 30 °C.
This conversion resulted in the separation of the whole of the analytes
in less than 8 min (Figure 2) with a final run time of 10 min for real samples, thus allowing
the complete elution of possible unknown peaks eluting after the HVA
peak (Figure 2C).

Figure 2 Chromatographic
profiles obtained by the proposed method of (A,B)
a standard mixture with (A) ECD followed by (B) sequential fluorescence
detection and (C,D) a CSF sample of a patient from the control group
with (C) ECD and (D) sequential fluorescence detection. Chromatographic
conditions: stationary phase = Atlantis T3 (4.6 × 150 mm and
3 μm) column; mobile phase: pH 5.2, 0.05 M citrate buffer, and
methanol (97/3, v/v). Flow rate was set at 0.5 mL/min at 30 °C.
The metabolites present in the effluent are measured at the second
electrode with a potential set at 400 mV, whereas the fluorescence
of pterins is sequentially measured at 450 nm after column electrooxidation
at the same potential and excitation at 350 nm (FU: arbitrary fluorescence
units).

The best separation in terms of
efficiency and resolution is obtained
with a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of pH 5.2 and 0.05 M citrate
buffer and methanol (97/3, v/v). The pH of the mobile phase should
not fall below 5.2, otherwise the run time would become too long.
Increasing the pH above 5.4 results in shortening the run time together
with a loss of resolution. The concentration of methanol should not
vary by more than 1%. Increasing the concentration of methanol above
4% results in shortening the run time with a concomitant loss of resolution.
Decreasing the percentage of methanol below 2% results in a dramatic
loss of efficiency and resolution. In the same way, the best efficiency
and resolution were obtained at 30 °C.

We checked the absence
of possible endogenous interferences including
DOPA, dopamine, dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid, serotonin, and 3-methoxy-tyramine,
which is the intermediate degradation product of dopamine leading
to HVA. All of these metabolites are oxidizable compounds that could
coelute with the targeted metabolites. Figure S2 shows that under our conditions, there is no coeluting peak
with the used internal standard (IS). Dopamine elutes before the IS
with a resolution higher than 1.3. Although serotonin and 3MT are
not separated, these metabolites cannot interfere with 5-HIAA because
their coeluting peaks are well-separated from the latter with a resolution
higher than 1.4.

Proposed Method
Taken together,
these analytical developments
led us to adopt the following chromatographic conditions: separations
were performed on an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 (2.1 × 100 mm and 1.8
μm) column protected by an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 VanGuard precolumn
(2.1 mm × 5 mm and 1.8 μm), with a mobile phase consisting
of pH 5.2 and 0.05 M sodium citrate/methanol (97/3, v/v) delivered
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at 30 °C. The ECD of the neurotransmitter
metabolites is performed at +600 mV at the second electrode, and the
sequential fluorescence detection of pterins was performed at λex 350 nm and λem 450 nm after coulometric
oxidation at the same potential. The final run time was 10 min.

Method Evaluation
The identification of metabolites
and pterins in authentic CSF samples was based on their retention
factors and their electrochemical and fluorescence properties as well
as proportional increases of corresponding peak areas after spiking
with known amounts of each target compound (Table S2).

All unknown peaks are well-separated from the target
metabolites under our chromatographic conditions. After more than
8 years of experience and more than 1500 handled CSF samples, we never
observed any interfering peak at the level of the IS.

In some
rare cases, probably because of the treatment, an interfering
peak may coelute with 3-OMD. In these cases, this peak disappears
just by decreasing the potential of the working electrode from 0.6
to 0.4 V. It is then necessary to calibrate the method at 0.4 V to
determine the 3-OMD concentration. Nevertheless, such an interfering peak cannot influence the diagnosis because
the diagnosis is not only based on the variation of a metabolite alone
but rather based on the modification of the CSF metabolic profile,
as shown in Table 1.

Table S1 summarizes the linearity
data
and LOQs for target analytes. The method was linear for all compounds
over the calibration range with a correlation coefficient (R2) higher than 0.99 for all instances. However,
the intercepts are negative in all instances. Hence, with this regression
model, it will not be possible to make a prediction for a point that
is outside the range of the data.

Within-run and between-run
precision for standard solutions did
not exceed 9.7% for all instances (Table S2). Within-run precision for authentic CSF samples spiked with known
amounts of metabolites and pterins did not exceed 9.5% with a recovery
higher than 91.8% for all instances. For each compound, the recovery
was determined after analyzing a pool of authentic CSFs before (P0) and after (Ps) spiking it with a known amount of the corresponding analyte, by
calculating the ratio: obtained amount (Ps) versus the theoretical amount (Th = P0 + added concentration) that gives [R = (Ps/Th) × 100]. Furthermore, there was no
significant difference between within-run precision for spiked CSF
samples and standard solutions as evidenced by p-values
greater than 0.05, with recoveries higher than 91.8% for all instances
(Table S2), thus indicating the absence
of significant matrix effect. Hence, we used aqueous standard samples
rather than authentic pooled CSF (p-CSF) samples for method calibration.

We checked the stability of the samples at 10 °C in the dark
in the injector after several hours. We did not observe significant
differences for 24 h. After 24 h, NH2 concentrations decreased by
about 15%, whereas BH2 concentrations increased by about 10% of their
respective initial values (Figure S3).
Hence, using this method, the samples maintained at 10 °C in
the dark should be analyzed within 24 h following defrosting.

In the same way, we checked the stability of the samples frozen
at −80 °C immediately after collection. Compared with
the initial values determined at day 4 after collection (and extemporaneous
defrosting), the data obtained for the aliquots of the same samples
defrosted after 12 months of storage at −80 °C showed
no significant differences. Hence, we avoided adding a preservative
agent to the samples, thus facilitating the collection procedure.

Age-Related Reference Ranges of Neurotransmitter Metabolites
and Pterins in Cerebrospinal Fluid
Figure 3 shows the distribution of the data obtained
with the proposed method for 1516 CSF samples collected from 1386
infants and children aged 1 day to 16 years (median 3.34 years) and
130 patients aged 16.01–80 years (median 21 years) without
known neurotransmitter disorder or 5-MTHF deficiency.

Figure 3 Variation of metabolite
concentrations in human CSF with patient
age.

The first PCA model was built
with HVA, 5-HIAA, MHPG, 3-OMD, 5-OTRP,
BH2, and NH2 as variables and 1516 observations remaining after removing
the outliers corresponding to the known 19 cases of neurotransmitter
disorders and 115 cases of immune system activation. Figure 4A shows the score plot where
observations are colored according to the patient’s age, from
blue for the lowest values to red for the highest values. Principal
components (CPs) 1 and 2 account for 37 and 17% of the total variance,
respectively. There is an evolution as a function of the age; however,
the overlap of the colored points indicates that it will be difficult
to distinguish age intervals.

(5-HTrp), BH2, and NH2 as variables and 1516 observations.
(A) Score plot and (B) loading plot.

In a second step, we considered only HVA, 5-HIAA, and MHPG,
which
are the main metabolites of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine,
respectively. The score plot still indicates that there is an obvious
evolution with age, but it is still difficult to distinguish the age
intervals (Figure S4A). Nevertheless, the
loading plot (Figure S4B) clearly shows
that HVA and 5-HIAA are the main contributors to CP 1 and that they
are strongly correlated. MHPG also contributes to CP 1 but to a less
extent. MHPG mainly contributes to CP 2 (Figure S4B). This makes sense once we consider the metabolic pathway
of these metabolites (Figure 1). Whereas HVA and 5-HIAA are derived from dopamine and serotonin,
which are the products of the same enzyme, namely, AADC, MHPG is derived
from norepinephrine, which depends on the action of an additional
enzyme, namely, DHB (Figure 1). This is also true for 3-OMD and 5-HTrp, which are the substrates
of AADC but the products of two different hydroxylases, TH and TrpH
(Figure 1). The loading
plot (Figure S4C) obtained in the third
step clearly shows that the latter mainly contributes to CP 2, which
separates them.

In the fourth step, we added BH2, and we observed
that this parameter
is a major outlier, contributing to a third CP (Figure S4D). This also makes sense as BH2 results from the
slow isomerization of qBH2, which is the oxidized intermediate of
BH4, the common cofactor of TrpH and TH (Figure 1). Finally, in the last step, we added NH2,
and we observed that it also contributes to the third component while
it is slightly correlated with BH2. The latter is being separated
by the axis of the third component (Figure 4B). This also makes sense once we consider
that NH2 is the precursor of BH4 (Figure 1).

In conclusion, although the PCA
model well-establishes the evolution
of the main metabolites with the age of patients as well as the correlations
between these parameters, it remains difficult to distinguish with
this model the relevant age intervals and thus to establish the reference
ranges.

Hence, we investigated the normality of the data by
using both
graphical representation (histograms and Q–Q plots) and Shapiro–Wilk
or Shapiro–Francia tests depending on the kurtosis.21 In most cases, the data were not normally distributed,
but they are log-normally distributed as shown by p-values less than 0.001 (Table S3). Nevertheless,
we used Pearson correlation coefficient to study the correlation between
metabolite concentrations and age.

As expected,16,18,22,23 a negative correlation was observed between
most metabolites and age in the whole group of patients (HIAA: r = −0.5549, p < 0.0001; HVA: r = −0.5602, p < 0.0001; 3-OMD: r = −0.3929, p < 0.0001; MHPG: r = −0.3355, p < 0.0001; and
BH2: r = −0.1459, p <
0.0001). Whereas the HVA/MHPG ratio showed a slight negative correlation
with age (r = −0.1829 and p < 0.0001), HVA/HIAA and HVA/3-OMD ratios showed a positive correlation
with age (r = 0.2365, p < 0.0001
and r = 0.0790, p = 0.0157, respectively).
By contrast, NH2 did not exhibit any correlation with age (r = 0.0373 and p = 0.2613).

In a
second step, we grouped the patients by age month by month
for the first year and year by year for the patients older than one
year. We also grouped the patients according to the previously published
data.16 Considering a p-value less than 0.05 statistically significant, data were mostly
log-normally distributed in all groups older than one month (Table S3).

Age groups were then compared
by using Student’s t-test. For HVA and 5-HIAA
concentrations, the differences
between the groups older than 1 month were significant. However, in
contrast to previous studies,16 HVA, MHPG,
and BH2 concentrations in the group of newborns younger than one month
were not statistically different from the group aged from 1 to 6 months.
This discrepancy may be attributed to the lower number of patients
included in previous studies.16 5-HTrp
was found to be less than 12 nmol/L in every CSF sample (Table 2). Nevertheless, the
correlation with age among the target metabolites was mostly similar
to those previously published.16,22

age or sex, strong positive correlations were
observed between HVA and HIAA (r = 0.7742 and p < 0.0001), HVA and MHPG (r = 0.4446
and p < 0.0001), HVA and 3-OMD (r = 0.4483 and p < 0.0001), MHPG and 3-OMD (r = 0.5918 and p < 0.0001), HVA and
BH2 (r = 0.2781 and p < 0.0001),
and HIAA and BH2 (r = 0.2339 and p < 0.0001). BH2 and NH2 also exhibited a slightly positive correlation
(r = 0.1241 and p = 0.0002). The
correlations between HIAA, HVA, and BH2 confirm that the BH2 concentration
well-reflects the BH4 availability in the CSF.

Table 2 summarizes
the reference intervals obtained with the proposed method. Except
for the patients aged less than one month, which are not different
from those aged between 1 and 6 months, the obtained reference ranges
are similar to those previously obtained in other countries by classical
methods.16,22,23 These results
thus strengthen the validation of the proposed method.

Analysis of
the Known Cases of Dopamine and Serotonin Metabolism
Disorders
The proposed method was applied to the diagnosis
of several known inborn errors of dopamine and serotonin metabolism
including 2 cases of Segawa syndrome, 1 case of sepiapterin reductase
deficiency, 3 cases of AADC deficiency, 1 case of dopamine transporter
deficiency, 1 case of PTPS deficiency, 11 cases of tyrosine hydroxylase
deficiency, as well as more than 100 cases of intracerebral immune
activation with elevated levels of NH2 (Table 2, Figure 5). The obtained results (Table 2) confirmed the expected CSF pattern of changes
in pterins and monoamine metabolites in patients.

Figure 5 Chromatographic profiles
obtained with the proposed method for
some patients with known neurotransmitter disorders. (A,B) AADC deficiency,
(C,D) DTDS, (E,F) TH deficiency, and (G,H) SR deficiency. The CSF
sample (C) has been diluted twice before injection. The injection
volume was 25 μL for (A,C) and 50 μL for (E,G).

Otherwise, the proposed method
allows the unambiguous detection
of NH2 increase, which is a known biomarker of immune system activation.24 It is worth noting that about 7% of the analyzed
CSF samples exhibited elevated levels of NH2. Hence, the proposed
method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of not only neurotransmitter
disorders but also all cases of intracerebral immune system activation,
which appear much more frequent than the former in the studied population.

Simultaneous Determination of BH4
Although BH4 determination
is not mandatory for the etiologic diagnosis of neurotransmitter disorders,
the determination of this cofactor may be interesting for metabolism
and pharmacokinetics studies.18

As
BH4 cannot be detected at pH 5.2 and can be detected at pH 7.4,18 we later developed a variant of the proposed
method able to simultaneously determine BH4. In fact, this variant
only differs in the pH of the mobile phase, that is, pH 7.4 instead
of pH 5.2 as used in the proposed method.

Setting the pH of
the mobile phase at 7.4 resulted in the simultaneous
detection of BH4 in addition to all target compounds (Figure 6) with a good resolution but
with different selectivities as reflected in the changes of the elution
order. Under these conditions, the optimum sensitivity is obtained
at an oxidation potential of +400 mV (first working electrode) for
5-HTrp and 5-HIAA (Figure 6A) and an oxidation potential of +600 mV (second working electrode)
for 3-OMD, HVA, and MHPG (Figure 6B). The signal decrease for 5-HTrp and 5-HIAA at +600
mV is linked to the consumption of a large part of these metabolites
at the first electrode set at +400 mV. To optimize the transformation
of BH4 into its fluorescent counterpart, it is mandatory to use both
electrodes for postcolumn oxidation of this pterin.

Figure 6 Chromatographic profiles
of a standard mixture and a CSF sample
obtained with a pH 7.4 mobile phase. (A–C) Standard mixture
with ECD at (A) +400 mV for the first electrode, (B) +600 mV for the
second electrode, followed by (C) sequential fluorescence detection.
(D–F) CSF sample with ECD at (D) +400 mV for the first electrode,
(E) +600 mV for the second electrode, followed by (F) sequential fluorescence
detection (see Figure 2 for the other chromatographic conditions).

Method evaluation showed that the analytical performances
of this
variant method operating at pH 7.4 are similar to those of the proposed
method operating at pH 5.2 (Table S4).
Also, the results obtained with the variant operating at pH 7.4 for
real-CSF samples (n = 50) showed a good correlation
with those obtained with the proposed method operating at pH 5.2 with
a correlation coefficient higher than 0.99 for all target metabolites
and pterins (Figure S5).

As the stability
of the CSF samples at pH 7.4 is limited to 6 h
in an autosampler at 10 °C18 instead
of 24 h for the proposed method and because the stationary phase is
less stable at pH 7.4 than under the conditions of the proposed method
operating at pH 5.2, we recommend using the proposed method for the
routine diagnosis of neurotransmitter disorders. Nevertheless, the
derived method operating at pH 7.4 can be used for the simultaneous
quantification of BH4 if needed as well as for checking the results
of any CSF sample suspected to contain some potential interferences.
In such cases, the difference in selectivity observed at pH 7.4 may
help to detect the possible unexpected exogenous interfering compounds
coeluting with the targeted compounds at pH 5.2 and vice versa.

After more than 6 years of experience, the only possible interfering
peaks we observed are those present on the chromatograms of Figures 2, 5, and 6. As shown in these figures,
all unknown peaks are well-separated from those of the targeted metabolites.

In fact, the only possible interferences that may occur are only
unexpected exogenous interferences linked to unknown treatments. If
there are some interferences coeluting with analytes and resulting
in one peak, which is obviously possible for any method of separation
of complex mixtures, it would be easy to suspect their presence. Indeed,
as the diagnosis of neurotransmitter disorders is based on the characteristic
CSF patterns (Table 1), such an interference would result in an unusual doubtful metabolic
profile. Hence, an alternative method of separation with a different
selectivity may be helpful to highlight such an interference.

Conclusions
An UHPLC method for a one-step rapid diagnosis of inborn errors
of metabolism of dopamine and serotonin is presented. The use of an
embedded-polar-group-bonded phase (ACQUITY HSS T3) and sequential
coulometric and fluorescence detections allows the simultaneous quantification
of neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins of interest. All target
neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins were quantified in a small
volume of CSF (50 μL) using a single filtration step for sample
preparation and analysis.

As the samples are stable without
adding any antioxidant agent
for 24 h in an autosampler at 10 °C and as the run time is 10
min, the number of samples including calibrators and quality control
that can be analyzed per run is 144.

The application of the
proposed method to the analysis of 1516
human CSF samples without known neurotransmitter disorders allowed
us to give the age-related reference ranges for key metabolites and
pterins among French population. Furthermore, the application of the
proposed method to several cases of known enzymatic defects confirmed
the expected CSF pattern of changes in pterins and monoamine metabolites
in patients.

Although previous methods using MS/MS detection
were less sensitive
than FD for pterin quantification,18 recent
advances in MS/SM detection19 notably in
terms of sensitivity show that the latter mode of detection is now
able to replace the former. As MS/MS detection is less dependent on
the resolution of the separation, the translation of the proposed
method to UHPLC–MS/MS is one avenue to improve the overall
throughput of this method. For the time being, the proposed method
is quite appropriate for the laboratories not already equipped with
the LC–MS/MS technology.

Methods
Chemicals and
Reagents
All reagents were purchased
from Sigma (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) and were used without
further purification.

Patient Samples
The CSF samples
were collected from
2008 to 2014 by lumbar puncture as previously described.18 Lumbar punctures were performed in several French
hospitals covering the entire French territory as part of normal clinical
management and research activities aiming to enhance the diagnosis
of neurological disorders of unknown origin with the written informed
consent of parents or legal representatives of each patient. This
study was performed according to French public health regulations
(Code de la santé publique—Article L1121-3,
modified by Law no. 2011-2012, December 29 2011—Article 5). Samples were collected in five fractions of 0.3 mL each as previously
described18 and were immediately frozen
with liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C until analysis.
The exclusion criteria were traumatic punctures, inadequate collection
and preservation of the samples, and l-DOPA and BH4 treatments.
Determination of 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate by HPLC–FD17 was performed for all patients.

The collected
CSF samples were divided into three groups. Group 1 includes CSF samples
collected by lumbar puncture from 1386 infants and children aged 1
day to 16 years (median 3.34 years) and 130 patients aged 16.01 to
80 years (median 21 years). Group 1 was considered as a reference
population with the same inclusion criteria as previously described (ref (18)). This group includes patients suffering from several neurological
disorders with initially unknown etiology including movement disorders
with or without encephalopathy, epileptic or neurodegenerative encephalopathy,
and meningoencephalitis. Group 2 includes CSF samples with known neurotransmitter
disorders collected from 16 infants and children (aged 1 day to 6.63
years, median 2.36 years) and 3 adults (aged 18.63 to 27.88 years,
median 24.46 years). Group 3 includes CSF samples collected from 115
patients (aged 0.02 to 64.64 years, median 25.6 years) with known
immune system activation.

Chromatographic Conditions and Sample Preparation
Preliminary
HPLC separations were performed on a Dionex Summit HPLC system (Les
Ulis, France). For the development of the method, the HPLC system
was coupled to a model 5011 cell controlled by a Coulochem 5100A module
(ESA, France) connected to a JASCO FP 920 detector equipped with a
16 μL standard cell. For simultaneous separation of neurotransmitter
metabolites and pterins, we used an Atlantis T3 (4.6 × 150 mm
and 3 μm) column (Waters, France). The mobile phase consisted
of a mixture of pH 5.2 and 0.05 M citrate buffer and methanol (97/3,
v/v). The flow rate was set at 0.5 mL/min at 30 °C. The metabolites
present in the effluent were measured at the second electrode with
a potential set at 400 mV, whereas the fluorescence of pterins was
sequentially measured at 450 nm after column electrooxidation at the
same potential and excitation at 350 nm.

For the UHPLC separations,
we used a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system connected to an ESA Coulochem
III electrochemical detector equipped with a 6011 model cell followed
by an ACQUITY UPLC fluorescence detector. For the separation of neurotransmitter
metabolites and pterins, we used an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 (2.1 ×
100 mm and 1.8 μm) column (Waters, France). The mobile phase
consisted of a mixture of pH 5.2 and 0.05 M citrate buffer and methanol
(97/3, v/v). The flow rate was set at 0.5 mL/min at 30 °C. The
metabolites and pterins present in the effluent were sequentially
measured under the same conditions as for the HPLC separation but
with a potential set at 600 mV. We changed the potential to 600 mV
to reach the limiting current. Obviously, the potential shift is due
to the used reference electrodes that are likely different between
the two used Coulochem models.

For sample preparation, 50 μL
of CSF or calibrator or QC
sample was diluted (1/1, v/v) in a solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (250 nM) used as an IS prepared in the mobile phase, before filtration
in a 5000 MWCO PES Vivaspin 500 filter (Sartorius, Aubagne, France)
and centrifugation (10 min at 12 000g and
4 °C). The resulting filtrate (50 μL) was injected into
the chromatograph. However, to respect the linearity of the method,
the injected volume must be appropriately reduced for some CSF samples
containing high levels of metabolites. Also, to avoid the dramatic
reduction in the area of the IS peak, some samples containing high
levels of metabolites must be appropriately diluted before addition
of the IS and injection.

Calibrators and Quality Controls
Stock standard solutions
were prepared by dissolving 400 μM of biopterin (B), neopterin
(N), BH2, and NH2 in 0.1 M HCl or 1 mM of HVA, HIAA, 3-OMD, 5-HTrp,
and MHPG in deionized water. After rapid preparation, aliquots of
the standard solutions were immediately frozen at −80 °C
until use.

To plot the calibration curves, the stock standard
solutions of N, NH2, B, and BH2 were diluted to give final concentrations
of 5, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 nM/L of each pterin. HVA was diluted to
give final concentrations of 15, 75, 187.5, 375, 750, and 1500 nM/L.
HIAA was diluted to give final concentrations of 10, 50, 125, 250,
500, and 1000 nM/L. MHPG, 3-OMD, and 5-HTrp were diluted to give final
concentrations of 5, 25, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 nM.

Analytical
recovery and precision studies were performed on the
p-CSF samples spiked with 3-OMD, 5-HTrp, MHPG, HIAA, HVA, BH2, B,
and NH2 at three concentration levels (low, medium, and high). Aliquots
of 200 μL of p-CSF sample residues (n = 10)
were spiked with 5, 12.5, and 50 nM/L of each pterin; 75, 187.5, and
750 nM/L of HVA; 50, 125, and 500 nM/L of HIAA, and 25, 62.5, and
250 nM/L of MHPG, 3-OMD, and 5-HTrp. The basal content of the p-CSF
sample was determined with the standard addition method (Skoog, DA.
1996). As internal quality control, we used aliquots of p-CSF frozen
at −80 °C until analysis. As external QC (EQC), we used
aliquots of diluted water (1/100, v/v) “Special assays in urine”
from ERNDIM (manufactured by the MCA Laboratory of the Queen Beatrix
Hospital, Netherlands) stored at −80 °C until analysis.
This EQC is used to control the 5-HIAA and HVA levels. For the control
of 3-OMD, 5-HTrp, and MHPG, we used their response factors as compared
to those of 5-HIAA and HVA.

Statistics
The Shapiro–Wilk
or Shapiro–Francia
tests were used to check the normality of the data distribution. Histogram
and normal probability plots were also drawn to graphically assess
the normality of the data. Comparisons were performed with a two-tailed
Student’s t-test, after checking the homogeneity
of variances using Fisher’s test. The p values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Relationships
between variables were examined using Pearson coefficient, linear
regression, and analysis of variance. Statistical analysis was performed
using MATLAB and excel.
