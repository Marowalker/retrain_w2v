A sequence
of oxidative cleavage/double nitroaldol condensation
followed by a few simple synthetic transformations can lead to polyhydroxylated
di- and triaminocyclohexanes from a readily available bicyclic hydrazine.
This new synthetic route provides a simple and general access to densely
substituted privileged scaffolds or fragments with a perfect control
of their relative configuration.

Introduction
Aminocyclohexitols
are a group of natural or synthetic compounds
with numerous biological activities.1 Among
them, cis-1,3-diaminocyclitols such as streptamine 1 or 2-deoxystreptamine 2 are known to play a
crucial role in the biological activity of aminoglycosides, a major
class of antibiotics (Figure 1).2 Furthermore, substituted cis-1,3-diaminocycloalkanes have been reported to be valuable
fragments or scaffolds for the design of RNA binders.3 In this context, our group has been involved in the synthesis
of polysubstituted 1,3-diamino cyclopentanes 3(4) or piperidines 4(5) starting from bicyclic hydrazine 5.6 Herein, we wish to report a straightforward and
fully stereoselective approach toward hydroxylated 1,3-di- and 1,3,5-triaminocyclohexanes
from a single precursor.

Figure 1 Examples of cis-1,3-diaminocyclitols
and structural
mimetics.

In our previous work, we have
shown that aldehyde 6 could be obtained from hydrazine 5 using either ozonolysis
or a two-step dihydroxylation–oxidative cleavage sequence.5 This aldehyde was then engaged in a reductive
amination to deliver precursors of piperidines 4. We
envisaged the possibility of conducting a double nitroaldol reaction,
from the same precursor 6, to prepare a bicyclic adduct 7 that would deliver polyhydroxylated 1,3,5-triaminocyclohexanes 8 after reductive cleavage of the hydrazine moiety (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Route
Cyclization of bis-aldehydes
with nitromethane was indeed intensively
investigated by Lichtenthaler and Ogawa on various substrates, including
1,5-dialdehydes derived from mono- or polysaccharides (“Sugar
dialdehydes”), leading to diastereomeric mixtures of nitroinositols.7

Such a strategy was also reported by Hasegawa
and Sable for the
preparation of triaminocyclohexanediols.8 From compound 9, obtained in seven steps from cis-3,5-dibromocyclopentene, reaction with nitromethane
under basic conditions gave an equimolar amount of diastereoisomers 10 and 11 in 80% overall yield (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Nitroaldol Condensation
from 1,3-Diaminocyclopentanediol 9
Results and Discussion
The nitroaldol
condensation was investigated using compound 12, prepared
from 5 in 86% yield, as the starting
material (Table 1).
The transient bis-aldehyde was generated by an oxidative cleavage
and engaged in the next step without any other treatment than a filtration
of the reaction mixture. No reaction was observed using sodium hydroxide9 as a base (entries 1–3). The use of sodium
alkoxide10 led to the desired compound,
albeit with a large amount of degradation product (entries 4–6).
The presence of benzyl alcohol in the crude reaction mixture indicated
that benzylcarbamates were cleaved under these basic conditions. A
slight yield improvement could be obtained by lowering the base concentration
(entry 7). Finally, best conditions were obtained using triethylamine11 as a base and running the reaction in nitromethane
as a solvent (entry 8), leading to compound 7 in 78%
yield on a multigram scale.

Although
six possible diastereomers can theoretically be obtained
with this condensation (Figure 2), compound 7 was formed as a single diastereomer,
as determined by the NMR analysis of the crude reaction product. Its
configuration could be determined by the NMR analysis of the purified
compound. 1H and 13C NMR experiments revealed
the absence of any plane of symmetry, discarding the formation of
meso compounds. The equatorial orientation of the nitro group was
furthermore established using correlation spectroscopy and nuclear
Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments. The stereoselective formation
of 7 can be explained by the reaction of the transient
bis-aldehyde keeping a Cs symmetrical conformation, followed by ring closure and equilibration
toward the thermodynamically favored bicyclic equatorial diastereomer.
This thermodynamic control is much more efficient in the case of the
formation of the rigid diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton than with
the synthesis of polysubstituted cyclohexanes reported by Hasegawa
and Sable.

Figure 2 Possible stereoisomers and relative configuration of compound 7.

The reactivity of adduct 7 was then explored (Scheme 3). Hydrogenolysis
under acidic conditions led to the triaminocyclohexitol 8a in a quantitative yield. The selective reduction of the nitro group
was performed in the presence of zinc in acetic acid, leading to compound 13 in a quantitative yield. This compound could be functionalized
by reductive amination with aldehyde or ketone, leading to compounds 14 and 15. N-substituted triaminocyclohexitols 8b and 8c were obtained after hydrogenolysis.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of cis-1,3-Diamino 5-Amino Cyclohexitols 8a–c
On the basis of our previous experience in acid-catalyzed
stereoselective
skeletal rearrangements of bicyclic hydrazines, we investigated the
behavior of compound 13 under nitrous acid deamination
conditions.12 Despite many experimental
efforts, we were not able to obtain the corresponding alcohol from
the diazonium intermediate. However, we were pleased to obtain compound 16 by adding a bromide source in the reaction mixture. The
formation of 16, established by NMR analysis, can be
explained by the formation of a transient azetidinium followed by
a selective ring opening, leading to rearranged compound 16 (Scheme 4).13

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Compound 16
Compound 16 was
quantitatively converted into diamine 17 by hydrogenolysis
(Scheme 5).14

Cyclohexitol 17
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported a ring-homologation
reaction of
bicyclic hydrazines based on a sequential oxidative cleavage/double
nitroaldol condensation. This fully diastereoselective reaction enables
the control of the relative configuration of five contiguous stereogenic
centers in a single operation. The polyfunctionalized bicyclic hydrazine 7, prepared on a gram scale from readily available bicyclic
hydrazine 5, furthermore provides a straightforward access
to a large diversity of 1,3-di- and 1,3,5-triaminocyclohexitols in
1–3 steps using simple synthetic transformations.

Experimental
Section
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial
suppliers
and used as received without further purification. Compounds 5 and 12 were prepared according to reported
procedures.5 Reactions were monitored by
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) carried out on 0.20 mm silica gel
(60-F254) with visualization by UV light or staining with phosphomolybdic
acid, ninhydrin, or Dragendorff’s reagent. Column chromatography
was performed on silica gel 60 Å (40–63 μm). All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker
NMR spectrometers operating at 300, 400, or 500 MHz (1H
value) and at 75 or 125 MHz (13C value), respectively.
HRMS spectra were recorded on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer or on
an ESI-QTOF II instrument Shimadzu.

To a vigorously stirred suspension of chromatographic
grade silica gel (9.90 g) in CH2Cl2 (156 mL)
was added a 0.65 M aqueous solution of NaIO4 (9.95 mL,
6.47 mmol, 1.4 equiv) dropwise while stirring, whence a flaky suspension
was formed. Diol 12 (1.84 g, 4.62 mmol, 1 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (150 mL) was then added, and the reaction was
monitored by TLC until disappearance of the initial product. The reaction
mixture was filtered on a sintered glass packed with Na2SO4, concentrated, and dissolved in nitromethane (12.5
mL, 231 mmol, 50 equiv). Triethylamine (96 μL, 0.69 mmol, 0.15
equiv) was added. The solution was stirred for 3 h at room temperature
and was then concentrated. Flash chromatography (CH2Cl2/MeOH 98:2) afforded 7 (1.64 g, 3.59 mmol, 78%)

was bubbled in the reaction mixture few seconds. After stirring for
4 additional hours, the reaction mixture was filtered through a fritted

To
a solution of 16 (18 mg, 37 μmol, 1 equiv) in MeOH·HCl
(1 mL) was added 10% palladium on activated charcoal (10 mg, 0.2 equiv)
under argon. The resulting black suspension was stirred at room temperature
under hydrogen (1 atm) for 25 h. MeOH·HCl 1.25 M (0.5 mL) and
10% palladium on activated charcoal (2 mg) were added under argon.
The resulting black suspension was stirred at room temperature under
hydrogen (1 atm) for 21 h and filtered through a nylon syringe filter
0.45 μm. The filtrate was concentrated to afford the final diamine 17 hydrochloride (7 mg, quantitative yield) as an orange oil.
