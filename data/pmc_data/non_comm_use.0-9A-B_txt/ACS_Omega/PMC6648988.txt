In the natural state, the concentration
of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere is about 300 μmol mol–1. Plants
need a suitable balance of CO2 to achieve optimal growth.
The optimum CO2 content corresponding to a high photosynthesis
rate is between 0.1 and 1.0% by volume. However, air has only a CO2 content of 0.03% by volume, so plants cannot use all of their
growth potential. The use of fertilizer to assist in the supply of
CO2 increases the rate of photosynthesis. In this work,
a slow-release CO2 gas fertilizer inspired by polyphenol
chemistry was prepared to provide sustainable CO2 that
could improve plant photosynthetic capacity and get a higher crop
yield. The core–shell structure was designed to confer gas
fertilizers slow-release property. Micron-sized calcium carbonate
particles with uniform particle size and regularity morphology, as
carbon sources for plant photosynthesis, was a core, and tannic acid
was coated on it as a shell via oxidative oligomerization and cross-linked
by polyetherimide. The structure and morphology of fertilizers were
characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive
spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. In vitro experiments,
the prepared fertilizers were proved to have slow-release properties.
And then through net photosynthesis rate, chlorophyll fluorescence
parameters, chlorophyll content, leaf area, leaf mass per area, and
dry matter to study the effects of slow-release CO2 gas
fertilizers on plant physiology of Brassica chinensis. The results revealed that the slow-release CO2 gas fertilizers
not only had good slow-release properties but also can well improve
plant photosynthesis.

Introduction
To meet the future food requirement caused
by the ever-increasing
population, it is urgent to solve the problem of present crop productivity.1 High photosynthesis rates can guarantee a high
grain yield. In the total output of crops (including root, stem, leaf,
seed etc.), only 5–10% of the nutrients is from the soil by
roots, and 90–95% is from photosynthesis.2,3 Carbon
dioxide (CO2) is the primary limiting factor for photosynthesis
because of its low concentration not only in vitro atmospheric environment
but also at the sites of carboxylation inside the leaves.4 Many scientists at home and abroad have proved
through genetic improvement experiments that the elevated carbon dioxide
concentration in the environment can enhance the photosynthesis of
plant leaves.5−7 Undoubtedly, high CO2 concentration contributes
to crop yield.8

Since Saussure first
reported the effect of CO2 fertilization
on plant productivity in 1804,9 many agricultural
scientists have studied the development and utilization of CO2 in depth. In developed countries, CO2 was first
applied to cucumbers, tomatoes, and salads (western-style mixed vegetables)
in greenhouse (enclosed space). In recent decades, the CO2 fertilizer (such as AGROSOL, a carbon dioxide gas fertilizer) was
applied to promote field condition (open space). CO2 fertilization
is based on the following process: the gas fertilizer enters the plant
stoma and reacts with its acidic environment to slowly release CO2 to promote plant growth. However, the potential mechanism
of CO2 gas fertilizers in plant photosynthesis is unclear.

In photosynthesis, CO2 diffuses from atmosphere to the
substomata of leaves and then to the sites of carboxylation.5 Generally, enhancement of CO2 is accompanied
by higher photosynthetic rate.5,8 However, under low light,
the limiting factor of photosynthetic rate is the light energy rather
than the available CO2.10 On
the contrary, under high or saturation light, the photosynthetic rate
will be saturated when the concentration of CO2 is beyond
the CO2 saturation point.10 Thus,
how to provide sustainable and sufficient concentration of CO2 is a key factor to enhance the crop yield.

In recent
years, slow-release technology has been widely used in
agriculture, medicine, and other aspects, and slow-release fertilizers
have received enormous attention because of decreasing a fertilizer’s
loss rate, supplying nutrients sustainably, lowering application frequency,
and minimizing potential negative effects associated with overdosage.11−15 Coated fertilizers are fertilizers with a thin layer coated on their
surface by physical coating to form a new fertilizer, so as to achieve
the effect of sustained-slow release. Recently, Messersmith et al.
have reported that a thin, surface adherent, and multifunctional biopolymer
coatings can be formed by oxidative oligomerization of polyphenol
precursors.16 Tannic acid (TA) was colorless,
nontoxic, biodegradable, inexpensive, and easily available, and polyhydroxy
can be oxidized in the air by self-polymerization to form a thin film,
thus becoming the ideal coating material. In this work, inspired by
the slow-release technology, we prepared sustained-release gas fertilizers
to better adapt to growth needs of plants. Herein, micron-sized calcium
carbonate particles with uniform size and morphology were prepared
and utilized as carbon sources for plant photosynthesis. TA was chosen
as a typical plant polyphenol precursor to illustrate the preparation
and structural manipulation of the coated fertilizers. Subsequently,
the as-formed coating was covalently cross-linked by polyethylenimine
(PEI) through Schiff base/Michael addition reaction between amine
groups of PEI and catechol/pyrogallol groups of TA to ensure slow-release
property of CO2. PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 as slow-release
CO2 gas fertilizer not only has better mechanical stability
but also achieves the effect of sustained release to meet the growth
needs of plants. Therefore, a new idea of improving plant photosynthetic
efficiency and improving crop yield was established by the modification
of fertilizer dosage forms.

Results and Discussion
Morphology and Characteristics
of PEI/TA-Coated CaCO3 as Slow-Release CO2 Gas
Fertilizers
Figure 1 presented the schematic
preparation process of PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 inspired by
polyphenol chemistry, which can be divided into three steps: (1) generation
of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS)-doped CaCO3 microspheres
through a coprecipitation process;20 (2)
oxidative oligomerization and deposition of polyphenol on the surface
of the microspheres; (3) further cross-linking of the as-formed polyphenol
coating with PEI through Schiff base/Michael addition reaction between
the amine groups of PEI and the catechol/pyrogallol groups of polyphenol.

Figure 1 Schematic
preparation process of PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 as slow-release
CO2 gas fertilizers.

Inspired by a commercially available gas fertilizer (AGROSOL),
calcium carbonate was selected as the carbon source of CO2 gas fertilizers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) image and
X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum (Figure 2A,C) well proved that the essential
components of AGROSOL are carbonate. In Figure 2B, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image
of AGROSOL is shown; it’s irregular and has uneven size of
the industrial grade carbonate, and the particle size generally reaches
tens microns. For that reason, about 4 μm particle size of PSS-doped
CaCO3 microspheres were prepared through a coprecipitation
process (as shown in Figure 3A). PSS is a crystalline shape controller that makes the prepared
calcium carbonate microspheres more orderly and more homogeneous.
A natural polyphenol (TA) not only has low-cost and is easily available
but also can be biodegradable. The pyrogallol groups of TA can be
easily oxidized to reactive quinones21 that
could connect with each other through oxidative coupling reactions,
then forming the oligomers.22,23 Considering the strong
interfacial affinity of TA,16 the oligomers
could be subsequently deposited on the surface of CaCO3 microspheres. As shown in Figure 3B, a rougher surface with “massif-like”
humps could be observed in TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres.
This evinced that TA oligomers were successfully deposited on the
CaCO3 microspheres. In addition, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of PSS-doped CaCO3 microspheres,
TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres, and PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres are also shown in Figure 3. Comparing with an uncoated fertilizer (Figure 3E), the light outer
shell is clearly observed on the boundary of dark CaCO3 microspheres (as is shown in Figure 3F), which also indicates that the TA is successfully
coated on the CaCO3 microspheres. However, the rougher
surface was probably as a result of irregular stacking of TA oligomers.
Owing to the weak interaction between TA oligomers (hydrogen bonds
and π-stacking interactions),21 the
TA coating would dissemble, which led to the failure of slow release.
To strengthen the mechanical stability of the TA coating, PEI was
introduced to chemically cross-link TA oligomers. As shown in Figure 3C, a much smoother
and compacter surface was obtained after PEI cross-linking, which
indicated that the interaction between TA oligomers were strengthened
by PEI. Comparing with TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres, more
regular and smoother light outer shells were clearly observed on the
boundary of dark CaCO3 microspheres (Figure 3G), which also evinced that the interaction
between TA oligomers were strengthened by PEI. The increase of N element
in the EDX spectrum of PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres
also clearly demonstrated that PEI is cross-linked to TA oligomers
(Figure 3D,H).

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The effect of introduced
TA on the thermal stability of the resulting polytannic acid (PTA)
was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and was depicted
in Figure 4A. TGA curves
also verified the successful coating of TA on CaCO3 microspheres.
The weight loss of the PSS-doped CaCO3 microspheres is
47.74% at temperatures up to 1000 °C. After the oxidative oligomerization
and deposition of polyphenol, the weight loss rate of TA-coated CaCO3 is apparently faster than PSS-doped CaCO3 microspheres.
The corresponding weight loss values at temperatures up to 1000 °C
with different deposition cycles are as follows: 49.57, 52.48, 55.30,
64.07, and 73.73%. This indicates that the percentage of TA of PTA-1,
PTA-2, PTA-3, PTA-5, and PTA-10 is 1.83, 4.74, 7.56, 16.33, and 25.99%,
respectively. The content of TA increases with the increasing number
of deposition cycles. Thus, it is indicated that we successfully prepared
TA-coated CaCO3 as slow-release CO2 gas fertilizers.

of several CO2 gas fertilizers. (A) polytannic
acid (PTA); (B) PEI introduced to chemically cross-link TA oligomers
(PEI/TA-coated CaCO3).

To improve the mechanical stability of TA-coated, PEI was
introduced
to chemically cross-link TA oligomers. The effect of introduced PEI
on the thermal stability of the resulting PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 was investigated with TGA and is depicted in Figure 4B. The weight loss of the PTA-1 is 49.57%
at temperatures up to 1000 °C. After chemical cross-linking with
different concentrations of PEI, the weight loss rate of PEI/TA-coated
CaCO3 is apparently faster than that of PTA-1. The corresponding
weight loss values at temperatures up to 1000 °C with different
concentrations of PEI are as follows: 51.53, 51.24, and 55.27%. This
indicates that the percentage of PEI of 0.2 PEI/TA-coated CaCO3, 1.0 PEI/TA-coated CaCO3, and 2.0 PEI/TA-coated
CaCO3 is 1.74, 1.67, and 5.7%, respectively. TGA curves
also proved the successful cross-link of PEI with TA oligomers. Through
the TGA data, we know the thickness of the coating of slow-release
CO2 gas fertilizers.

Slow-Release Behavior of
CO2 Gas Fertilizers in Vitro
It is difficult to
observe and detect the CO2 release
process of slow-release CO2 gas fertilizers in the plant
stomata, so we use the one-factor experimental method to simulate
slow-release behavior of above-mentioned fertilizers in vitro. The
amount of fertilizers per test is known by coating rate (obtained
through TGA) because we need to ensure that the content of calcium
carbonate of as carbon source is constant. We first used inorganic
acid (dilute hydrochloric acid, pH 2) to simulate the acidity of plant
stomata (in Figure 5A,B) and also try to use organic acids such as dl-tartaric
acid (as shown in Figure 5C). The CO2 release amount was continuously recorded
using the Li-840A CO2/H2O gas analyzer. As shown
in Figure 5, it recorded
CO2 cumulative release quantity in first 4 h, because of
the instruments and other objective reasons, and did not continue
to record. However, it is obviously observed that the trend of the
CO2 cumulative release quantity curves is infinitely close
to the same level because the content of calcium carbonate of as a
carbon source is constant. When the slow-release layer is coated,
the release curve obviously has a slow-release step, and with the
increase of deposition cycles, the slope of the release curve is more
gentle and the release step is more longer (insets of Figure 5A–C). It can be attributed
to the thicknesses of coated films. We presume that coated films have
a “barrier-like” effect to hinder the release of CO2. When the film is thicker, the barrier of CO2 becomes
bigger. From the previous SEM and TEM images, we can see that the
coating formed by TA is unstable, so PEI was introduced to strengthen
the mechanical stability of the TA coating by chemically cross-linking.
As shown in Figure 5B, PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 has a better sustained-release
effect than TA-coated CaCO3, and the mechanical stability
is improved. To better simulate the acidic environment of plant leaf
stomata, we do the same release experiments using dl-tartaric
acid as an organic acid of common and high content in plant leaves.
It also proved prepared fertilizers has good sustained-release properties.

Application of PEI/TA-Coated
CaCO3 as Slow-Release
CO2 Gas Fertilizers
While spraying CO2 gas fertilizers at 12:00 pm, we picked antepenultimate leaves of Brassica chinensis, rapidly prepared sample, fixed
by stationary liquid, freeze dried, and then tested by SEM, finally
got SEM images of B. chinensis’s
stomata. Figure 6 shows
SEM images of B. chinensis’s
stomata, A is a blank control (CK) without fertilization just spray
distilled water, and B is plant stomata after fertilizing slow-release
CO2 gas fertilizers. From the Figure 6, we can clearly see that the CO2 gas fertilizers entered into the plant stomata.

Effects of Slow-Release CO2 Gas Fertilizers on Plant
Photosynthetic Characteristics of B. chinensis
Net photosynthetic rate (Pn) has been widely used as an indicator of CO2 gas exchange
through the stomata pore of leaves, represented the capacity of photosynthetic
CO2 fixation used to generate sugars carbohydrates.10 As expected, compared with CK, Pn was increased in all of CO2 gas fertilizer
treatments, thereby contributing to development and growth of the
plants (Table 1). Those
results can be further supported by higher chlorophyll content under
all of CO2 gas fertilizer treatments (Table 1). It’s well documented
that chlorophyll is essential in photosynthesis,24 allowing leaves to absorb light energy. Generally, the
increase of chlorophyll content is accompanied with the enhancement
of photosynthetic capacity.25 Thus, application
of CO2 gas fertilizers can promote plant chlorophyll synthesis
and have higher photosynthetic capacity. Furthermore, the treatment
of PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 has remarkable effects to the leaf
area, leaf mass per area, and dry biomass, especially the latter two
(Table 1). Leaf mass
per area as an important physiological indicator of photosynthetic
capacity reflected the dry matter accumulation of plant.26 In the treatment of PEI/TA-coated CaCO3, the Pn, leaf area, and leaf mass per
area significantly increased, indicating that slow-release CO2 fertilizers could effectively improve the photosynthetic
capacity of B. chinensis, increase
dry matter accumulation, and consequently promote the enhancement
of crop yield.

Given the slow-release CO2 gas fertilizers
diffused
into the substomatal cavities (Figure 6), CO2 was released at those sites and used
to plant photosynthesis. We inferred that the photosynthetic capacity
will be enhanced because of increased CO2 supplied by slow-release
CO2 gas fertilizer in short-term.

Chlorophyll fluorescence
is a probe of photosynthesis.27 Our results
showed that no differences of the
maximum quantum yield of PS II photochemistry (Fv/Fm) was observed among all the
treatments, indicating that photosynthesis apparatus was not damaged
by CO2 release of CO2 gas fertilizers.Compared
with CK, the leaves spraying CO2 gas fertilizers showed
the similar of ETR(II) and Y(II). Considering higher Pn of leaves applied CO2 gas fertilizers, it
is implied that photorespiration may be inhibited during the photosynthetic
process. As discussed above, CO2 will be collected in the
substomatal cavities, the enzyme RuBisCo (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase is an important carboxyl enzyme in calvin cycle
of photosynthesis and catalyzes the reaction between RuBP and carbon
dioxide) will prefer to benefit CO2 fixation and hardly
combines with oxygen.8

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared the CO2 gas
fertilizers with sustained-release property and applied it to the B. chinensis growth. Through the systematic study,
we have found that the slow-release CO2 fertilizers not
only are very stable core–shell structure but also have sustained-release
property and most importantly can slowly release CO2 in
situ in plant stomata. Finally, plant physiological characteristics
also proved that prepared slow-release CO2 fertilizers
can improve the photosynthesis efficiency of plants and ultimately
can promote plant growth.

Materials and Methods
Materials
AGROSOL
(a commercially available carbon
dioxide gas fertilizer) was purchased from Austrian Agrosolution Company.
PSS (Mw ca. 70 000), TA, and tris(hydroxymethyl)
aminomethane (Tris) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company. PEI
(Mw ca. 10 000 Da; branched) was
purchased from Xi’ya Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Shandong,
China. dl-Tartaric acid, sodium carbonate anhydrous (Na2CO3), and calcium chloride anhydrous (CaCl2) were obtained from Tianjin Sheng’ao Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. The water used in all experiments was deionized. The pH
values of solutions were measured with a PHS 25 pH-meter (Shanghai
Instrument Electric Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Lei magnetic
instrument factory, Shanghai, China) and adjusted by addition of HCl
solution (10 mM).

Preparation of PSS-Doped CaCO3 as CO2 Gas
Fertilizers
First, PSS-doped CaCO3 microspheres
(diameter: 3–4 μm) were prepared by a coprecipitation
process and utilized as CO2 gas fertilizers for plant photosynthesis.
Specifically,17 80 mL of 0.33 M Na2CO3 solution was rapidly added into 80 mL of 0.33
M CaCl2 solution containing 240 mg of PSS under vigorous
stirring for 30 s. After standing for 10 min, PSS-doped CaCO3 microspheres were acquired through centrifugation and water washing.
Then, the precipitate was dried under vacuum to a constant weight.

Preparation of TA-Coated CaCO3 as Slow-Release CO2 Gas Fertilizers
In a typical procedure,17 2 g of PSS-doped CaCO3 microspheres
as mentioned above were dispersed in 200 mL of Tris-HCl buffer (50
mM, pH 8.0) containing 1.0 mg mL–1 TA. After gently
stirring at room temperature for 2 h, the microspheres were collected
by centrifugation and washed with water three times. The fertilizers
were dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 40 °C, and the
resulting products were obtained. To get PSS-doped CaCO3 with different thicknesses of TA-coated, the number of deposition
cycles was designed at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10, respectively. The deposition
procedure was repeated in the same way as mentioned above. The resulting
products are denoted as PTA-1, PTA-2, PTA-3, PTA-5, and PTA-10 where
1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 refer to the number of deposition cycles.

Preparation
of PEI/TA-Coated CaCO3 as Slow-Release
CO2 Gas Fertilizers
The 0.5 g acquired TA-coated
CaCO3 microspheres were redispersed in 50 mL of Tris-HCl
buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) with 1.0 mg mL–1 PEI, which
was gently stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h. Then, the microspheres
were centrifuged and washed with water three times, and then the precipitate
was dried under vacuum to a constant weight.

Characterization Techniques
SEM (Hitachi SU8010) and
the attached EDX and XPS were performed to measure the morphology
and elemental composition of AGROSOL, PSS-doped CaCO3 microspheres,
TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres, and PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres. TEM (Hitachi H-600) was used to observe the
morphology and thickness of the TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres
and PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 microspheres. Thermal stability
was determined by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, Netzsch STA449F3)
over a temperature range of 25–1000 °C at a heating rate
of 20 K min–1 under a N2 atmosphere.

Release Behavior of TA-Coated CaCO3 and PEI/TA-Coated
CaCO3 as Slow-Release CO2 Gas Fertilizers
The release behavior of AGROSOL, PSS-doped CaCO3, TA-coated
CaCO3, and PEI/TA-coated CaCO3 was detected
as follows: for example, 25 mg of PTA-1 was encapsulated at 500 mL
round-bottom flask under 50 rpm string, and then 70 mL of pH 2 hydrochloric
acid solution (used to simulate plant stoma acidic environment) was
slowly added to sealed round-bottom flask. The CO2 release
quantity was sustained record by LI-840A CO2/H2O gas analyzer (Li-6400, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The specific
amount of fertilizer was obtained by calculating the coating rate
of the slow-release fertilizers by TGA.

To better simulate the
acidic environment in the stomata of plant leaves, a common and high
content organic acid (dl-tartaric acid) was used for similar
release experiments. The specific method is as follows: for example,
weigh 10 mg of PTA-1 in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask and weigh the
same amount of dl-tartaric acid under 50 rpm string, and
then slowly add 50 mL of distilled water through a separatory funnel
to a closed round-bottom flask. The CO2 release quantity
was continuously recorded through the LI-840A CO2/H2O gas analyzer. The specific amount of fertilizer was obtained
by calculating the coating rate of the slow-release fertilizers by
TGA. Other slow-release CO2 gas fertilizers are tested
in the same manner as described above.

Plant Materials and Experimental
Design
Our study was
conducted at Shihezi University, Xinjiang, China (45°19′N,
86°03′E). B. chinensis (Brassical rapa L. chinensis) were grown in plastic pots (19 cm in diameter, 28 cm in height)
filled with substrates (soil vs vermiculite vs pearlite = 1:1:1).
All pots were exposed to full sunlight (the maximum intensity is 2000
μmol·m–2·s–1)
during their growth period. Five or six seeds were sown in each pot.
By the time the first true leaf had expanded, only one plant per pot
was left for uniformity. The seedlings, with the growth of three true
leaves, were watered with the nutrient solution (contained enough
Ca2+ and Mg2+) three times a day and seedlings,
with four leaves, were then divided into four groups for different
fertilizer treatments. Four treatments were used: blank control (CK,
just spray the distilled water), AGROSOL, PSS-doped CaCO3, and PEI/TA-coated CaCO3. We used spray bottle and sprayed
fertilizer on the abaxial surface of leaves at 12:00 pm every day.
It’s been sprayed for half a month, and then, the third upper
leaf was measured. Every treatment had at least three replicates.

Measurement of Photosynthetic Characteristics
The morphology
of processed plant stomata was observed by SEM (Hitachi SU8010). Gas
exchange measurements were carried out between 11:00 am and 13:00
pm using a portable gas exchange analyzer system (Li-6400, Li-Cor
Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a blue-red LED light source
(Li-6400-02). During the measurements, the reference CO2 concentration was set as 400 μmol mol–1 and
the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) was maintained at 1800 μmol·m–2·s–1. When measuring CO2 assimilation rates, the leaf temperature is (20 th2) °C
and relative humidity is (56 a2)%.

Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence
was measured using the IMAGING-PAM (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). Fully
dark-adapted plants (2 h) were used to determine the maximum quantum
yield of PS II (Fv/Fm). The leaf was illuminated with an actinic light of 1051
μmol·m–2·s–1 for
5 min; the light-adapted maximum and minimum fluorescence (Fm′ and Fo′) were recorded after the fluorescence signal reached
a steady state (Fs). The maximum quantum
yield of PS II was calculated as Fv/Fm = (Fm – Fo)/Fm (Fm and Fo are the dark-adapted
maximum and minimum fluorescence, respectively).18 Actually, PS II quantum efficiency (Y(II)) was (Fm′ – Fs)/Fm′.18 The rate of electron transport was estimated
from (Fm′ – Fs)/Fm′ ×
0.5 × leaf absorptance × PAR (the coefficient 0.5 is because
an electron transfer needs to absorb two quanta, and photosynthesis
includes two optical systems; leaf absorption refers to the ratio
of light intensity absorbed to plant leaves).

Chlorophyll (Chls)
contents were determined in discs from leaves,
removed by a punch (total of about 1 cm2). Discs of the
leaves were extracted in 80% (v/v) acetone for 24 h at room temperature
in the dark.28,29 The absorbance of an extract
was measured with a UV-2041 spectroscopy (Shimadzu, Japan) at 663
and 645 nm. The concentrations of Chls per unit leaf area were determined,
using the equations according to Lichtenthaler.19        Here, An is the absorbance
at a given wavelength (n), V is
the volume of each extracting solution,
and S is the area of leaf discs.

Total leaf
area of the whole plant was measured with a leaf area
meter Li-3100 (Li-COR, Lincoln, USA). After that, antepenultimate
leave of each plant was immediately punched five leaf discs by a punch
(diameter of 0.8 cm), and then the overground part of plant and the
discs were heated to de-enzyme at 105 °C for 30 min and dried
at 80 °C until a constant weight (dry weight, DW) was reached
in an oven. Finally, the dry biomass and the leaf mass per area were
achieved. Leaf mass per area was calculated as dry weight/area of
the leaf discs.

Statistical Analysis
All data were
tested by analysis
of variance (ANOVA). The significance of differences between treatment
means were separated by using Student–Newman–Keuls (S–N–K)
test at the 0.05 probability level.
