We
use a double nanohole optical tweezer to analyze the protein
composition of egg white through analysis of many individual protein
trapping events. The proteins are grouped by mass based on two metrics:
standard deviation of the trapping laser intensity fluctuations from
the protein diffusion and the time constant of these fluctuations
coming from the autocorrelation. Quantitative analysis is demonstrated
for artificial samples, and then, the approach is applied to real
egg white. The composition found from real egg white corresponds well
to past reports using gel electrophoresis. This approach differs from
past works by allowing for individual protein analysis in heterogeneous
solutions without the need for denaturing, labeling, or tethering.

Introduction
The scientific community recognizes the
need to develop new technologies
for identifying and quantifying proteins in complex samples.1 For example, the US National Institute of Health
noted: “our ability to identify and quantify proteins in complex
(e.g., clinical) samples is progressing steadily, but it is clear
that orders-of-magnitude improvements in the associated technologies
would enable substantial advances in a large range of biomedical research
areas”.2 There are many candidate
technologies to achieve this goal, such as gel electrophoresis,3 mass spectrometry,4 labeling (e.g., fluorescence5), and nanopores.6 Gel electrophoresis denatures the protein7 and removes it from its natural environment.
Mass spectrometry also requires gas-phase ionization of the proteins.8 Labeling has been shown to alter the natural
behavior of proteins9−11 Although nanopores are intriguing for protein analysis,
including shape and size,12−14 and even potentially sequencing,15 the fast translocation time makes analysis challenging
and techniques such as tethering16 and
optical tweezing17,18 have been suggested to slow down
translocation.

Double nanohole (DNH) optical tweezers have been
used to isolate
single proteins in solution without the use of tethers or labels.19−23 This method does not denature the protein and allows for dynamic
studies on the molecular level. It has shown signatures for protein–protein
interactions,20 protein–small-molecule
interactions,21 and protein–DNA
interactions.22 The tweezers have also
been used to obtain the low-frequency vibrational modes.24,25 In previous works, we have explored the dynamics of the trapping
events and the particle escape from the trap due to Brownian motion.26,27 Here, we operate with higher laser power so there is no release
once the particle is trapped. Occasionally, brief trapping events
of a few seconds can occur, but those events were ignored in our analysis.
In this work, we rely on the linear mass dependence of the fluctuations
of the trapped laser signal28 and a −2/3
power mass dependence with its time constant23 to differentiate proteins based on mass in a heterogeneous mixture
and in unpurified egg white.

These results show the promising
capabilities of using DNH tweezers
in other unprocessed physiological solutions, such as blood samples,
to analyze trapped proteins and to translocate them29 for further reactions with different agents. Fabricating
the DNH on the end of an optical fiber30 can be incorporated in a simple microwell setup, without any microscope
optics. Multiple fibers can be used for simultaneously trapping molecules
in the same sample or in different ones. Our technique has the potential
of orders-of-magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of the analysis
as it enables probing single molecules. Another significant improvement
is in the reduced preparation time for dealing with raw samples, compared
to other methods which require preparatory treatment such as purification.7

Methods
Figure 1a shows
the optical tweezer setup modified from an optical tweezer kit (Thorlabs,
OTKB/M) and force measurement model (Thorlabs, OTKBFM). The detector
was replaced with a silicon-based avalanche photodetector (APD) (Thorlabs,
APD110A). A half-wave plate (HWP) and polarizer were added to the
setup to align the beam polarization to be perpendicular to the length
of the DNH for maximum field enhancement.31,32 The trap laser was changed to a continuous laser which operates
at a wavelength of 852 nm (Thorlabs, DBR852P). The laser power was
maintained at 16 mW at the location of the trapping site.

setup. (a) Schematic of the trapping setup containing:
a laser diode; HWP; polarizer; mirror; beam expander; dichroic mirror;

fabricated with FIB into 100 nm of gold. (top): SEM image of DNH,
imaging plane is perpendicular to surface normal. (bottom): Tilted
image of the same aperture, imaging plane is tilted 52° to surface

DNHs were fabricated in a 100
nm thick gold film adhered to glass
with a 5 nm Ti layer (EMF Corporation) using a focused ion beam (FIB)
(Hitachi FB-2100 FIB & FEI Helios NanoLab 650) with a dwell time
of 10 μs and 35 passes. The DNH was produced by milling two
180 nm circles with a 35 nm line separating the two circles. The resulting
structure on the gold sample is slightly tapered throughout the thickness
of the gold piece, which has been shown to increase the trapping efficiency.33Figure 1b shows an image of the DNH, acquired using a scanning electron
microscope.

The gold film containing the DNH was rinsed with
isopropanol, methanol,
and deionized water and dried using nitrogen gas. Samples were then
prepared by pipetting 10 μL of sonicated solution placed between
the gold film and a cover glass slide (Gold Seal, 24 × 60 mm
no. 0). The different solutions used pure proteins (for reference
ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, and ovomucoid—Sigma-Aldrich GE28-4038-41
& T2011-250MG) and chicken egg white from a local grocery store.
All solutions were made in a phosphate buffer solution (1× PBS)
and stored at 4 °C. The pure protein solution had a 1% concentration
by weight, the control heterogeneous solution had equal parts of 1%
ovotransferrin and ovalbumin solution by volume, and the egg white
solution had a 1% concentration by volume. The gold film was adhered
to the cover glass with adhesive microscope spacers (Grace Bio-Labs,
GBL654002), which formed the microwell. The entire sample assembly
was mounted in the inverted microscope optical trapping tweezer setup.

Analysis
Two specific properties were extracted from the trapped signals
of each event, the standard deviation (SD) and the fast time constant
(τ) of the autocorrelation function (ACF). Assuming a spherical
shape, we express the trapping potential as proportional to the volume
of the object (which scales as the radius cubed, r3)34 1  where np is the
refractive index of the particle, nm is
the refractive index of the surrounding medium, r is the particle radius, and I0 is the
intensity of the laser beam at the trapping site.

The intensity
of the transmission picked up by the APD is proportional
to the potential energy so we can expect the signal intensity to scale
with the molecule volume and the molecular mass (assuming a constant
density) 2  

The fluctuations
in the signal intensity (Figure 2a) result from the Brownian motion of the
particle in the trap. The motion of the particle in the trap can be
modeled by an overdamped Langevin equation.35 By taking the autocorrelation of the time series signal (Figure 2b), we can find its
exponential decay time (τ), which is used in conventional optical
traps as a measure of the trapping stiffness36 3  where γ is the Stokes’ drag and
κ is the stiffness, which relates the gradient force to the
displacement (x) of the molecule from the equilibrium
position (like a spring constant). 4   5  where E is the electric field.
Using eqs 4 and 5, we see that the exponential time constant scales
with 1/r2 6  

Figure 2 Trapping event of an
egg white protein. (a) APD voltage signal
and inset of the trapped state. The untrapped state is indicated in
blue, and the trapped state is indicated in red. (b) ACF for untrapped
(blue) and trapped (red) states with a two-exponent function fit to
ACF for trapped data (dashed black).

In this work, the ACF of trapped signals was found to fit
well
with a two-exponent function. We attribute the faster time scale change
to be the one related to the stiffness of the trap. The slower time
constant is assumed to be related to conformational changes of the
proteins, as was found in previous works.19,23 When analyzing the relaxation time of the ACF for the purpose of
characterizing the molecular weight, the time constant of interest
is the faster one.

We have shown in a previous work23 that
the SD of the trapped signal has a linear dependence on the molecular
mass of size standard proteins. We have also shown the time constant
(τ) of the ACF to have a −2/3 power dependence on molecular
mass.

Figure 2a shows
the time series of a typical trapping event, showing a distinction
between the untrapped (blue) and trapped state (red). The inset shows
a zoomed-in image of the signal variation in the trapped state that
is used in this analysis. Trapping was observed and identified from
the sudden increase in transmission observed on the APD.26,37−39 We have established previously that these are single-particle
trapping events from the uniform size of the trapping step for a given
particle and the distinct characteristic of (infrequent) multiple
particle events.39−41

Data from the APD were sampled at a rate of
100 kHz (Advantech
USB-4711A) and were downsampled by a factor of 100 by straight averaging.
The SD was calculated for a 5 s segment out of the trapped signal
and was divided by the mean value of the untrapped signal (before
the increase in the transmission signal).

Figure 2b shows
the ACF calculated for a 1 min segment of trapped data and fitted
to a two-exponent function using the method of least squares. We attribute
the slower time constant to conformational changes of the proteins
that causes fluctuations in the trapped signal, as seen in our previous
works.28,42,43 The faster
time scale change is related to the stiffness of the trap. In this
work, trapped egg white proteins were analyzed using two properties:
the SD of the signal intensity (I) and the faster time constant (τ).
Using eqs 2 and 6, we approximate τ having a −2/3 power
dependence on the signal SD.

Experimental Results
We first analyzed
pure protein samples to ensure consistency of
our setup with previous works. We then performed trapping analysis
on a controlled heterogeneous mixture, a solution made of 50% ovalbumin
and 50% ovotransferrin.

Figure 3 shows the
SD as a function of τ for the individual trapping events in
this artificial heterogeneous mixture. Two separate groupings are
found, and using our analysis on the pure proteins, we attribute the
black triangles to ovotransferrin and the blue circles to ovalbumin.
Interestingly, an equal number of trapping events were found for each
protein.

Figure 3 SD and ACF time constant (τ) of ovotransferrin and ovalbumin
trapping events. A mixed solution of ovotransferrin and ovalbumin
(1:1 ratio by volume).

Figure 4 shows
a
similar analysis for egg white solution. A total of 25 events were
obtained for this DNH, and the results of the SD and τ are plotted
on a log–log scale. On the basis of SD and τ, we attribute
group A (black triangles) to proteins with a molecular mass greater
than 49 kDa, group B (blue circles) to proteins with a molecular mass
ranging between 36 and 49 kDa, and group C (green squares) to proteins
with a molecular mass below 36 kDa. A linear curve was fit to the
events in the graph and was shown to have a slope of −0.66.
Water molecules, salts, lipids, and glucose, which contribute the
remainder egg white content, are not expected to get trapped because
of their small size (<1 kDa) and therefore were neglected in this
analysis.

SD of trapped signals with respect to their τ. Trapping events
in group A were classified as particles with a molecular weight higher
than 49 kDa; trapping events in group B were classified as trapped
particles with a molecular weight in the range of 36–49 kDa;
and trapping events in group C were classified as trapped particles
with a molecular weight lower than 39 kDa.

Discussion
We note that carbohydrates are also found in
egg white but their
abundance is lower than that of proteins. Their molecular weight is
typically smaller (on the order of kilodaltons), and they are commonly
bound to proteins influencing the protein molecular weight.44 It is unlikely that we can trap the carbohydrates
alone, but proteins trapped with carbohydrates will have varying size
because they appear as a complex. This may explain the larger variation
seen in the time constants and SD of the egg white data (variation
of 0.006 in egg white SD vs 0.002 in pure ovalbumin SD and of 11 ms
in egg white τ vs 8 ms in pure ovalbumin τ).

Table 1 compares
the abundance (by τ and SD) of our trapping events with reports
of egg white composition from the literature.45,46 The last column in the table does not include proteins that are
less than 1.5% in composition or have a very large molecular weight
(which may be too large to enter the trapping site).24 Considering the statistical error, good agreement is seen
between our trapping method and those past results.

Fouling of the DNHs occurs after a few days of continuous
measurement,
which limits the collection period. Figure 5 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of a new DNH aperture just after it has been milled, compared
with an aperture that was used for continuous trapping over a week. The
fouling of the DNH structure is seen. The optical signal does not
show trapping on these fouled samples. We fabricate several DNHs on
a single gold sample, and each of these can be used in series; however,
there is some signal variation between the DNHs23 (which is in part due to the grains in gold47 and the instabilities in the FIB).

52° tilt and a week-old DNH (c), top view, and (d), 52°
tilt. Figures show loss of sharpness in the image around the cusps
and edges.

The time to trap is quite long
in our samples. At 0.01% pure sample,
the time to trap was prohibitively long. At 0.1 and 1%, the trapping
times were similar (on the order of minutes). On the basis of diffusion
considerations alone, we would expect a much faster time to trap;
however, for these small particles, we suspect that surface-charge
effects are playing a role, as recent ionic detection work has noted
that screening around metals does limit detection events until very
high concentrations are seen.48 The surface
charge on the glass is negative. Because of the phosphate buffer,
there also exists a net negative charge on the proteins.49−51 The like-charges repel the proteins, which results in a longer time
to trap.22 We are presently investigating
different surfaces to attempt to mitigate this effect and obtain higher
throughput trapping. For example, applying a monolayer of methoxypoly
(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) thiol was used to reduce effects of protein
absorption into the gold sample.52 The
optical signal will get affected in case of protein adsorption within
the nanoaperture itself which makes the DNH not useful for trapping,
in which case, a different one must be used. We confirm that single
trapping events are not the result of particles adsorbed to the surface
by blocking the laser after each event and observing the voltage level
returning to the untrapped level prior to the next trapping event,
as shown in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows a
second jump (increase in transmission) within the trapped state. We
attribute that to a second molecule that enters the trap, as was shown
in our previous work.53,54 These rare events were not studied
in this work and have been excluded from the data collected.

Figure 6 Time trace
of the trapping event of a protein. The laser is blocked
for ∼5 s after trapping and the voltage level goes back to
the untrapped state level. The inset zooms in on the trapped-state
voltage levels.

Figure 7 Time trace of a dual
trapping event. A second jump in the laser
transmission after the first trapping event. We assume this is a result
of a second molecule entering the trap.

The slope of the fit of Figure 4 is −0.66, in good agreement of the
scaling
of mass to the −2/3 power to τ and linearity to SD. Previously,
we obtained anomalously large τ values for ovotransferrin,23 which have been modified to be in line with
theory by using the two-time constant fit. The appearance of two time
scales (perhaps the slower being from conformational/orientational
changes of the protein) was clear in the time series data.

The
right side of Figure 8 shows the time traces and ACFs of single trapping events
out of egg white proteins that were characterized in each one of the
groups (A, B, and C in Figure 4). A comparison can be made with pure protein trapping events
(ovotransferrin, ovalbumin, and ovomucoid) that are presented on the
left of Figure 8. Overall,
inspection of the trapping events with the pure proteins and the egg
white proteins shows matching characteristics. Slight variations in
the signal were observed even for the same protein; however, these
were also present for the pure proteins, so we attribute them either
to variations in the trapping landscape or natural variations in the
protein. Nevertheless, the SD amplitude and time constant analysis
gave similar values among the same protein.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated
the use of DNH optical tweezing in the analysis
of protein composition of unpurified heterogeneous solutions. This
development allows for single-molecule control, enabling studies on
isolated proteins for analysis of their dynamics and interactions.
For example, our method can differentiate mutant and wild-type p53
from characteristics with DNA interactions,22 and drug developments such as correcting mutant forms of proteins
like metallochaperone for p5355−57 will benefit from single-molecule
control. Also, compositional analysis can be performed on food and
other mixtures. On the basis of scaling-up to several fibers (about
10) and reducing the trapping time to below a minute, analysis of
around 1000 proteins per sample is envisionable in the future. This
method is unlikely to compete with high throughput methods but does
have advantages of providing single-molecule analysis such as allowing
for richer statistics and interacting the isolated species with other
entities.58 With these improvements, this
method is promising for disease diagnosis, drug development, targeted
therapy, food analysis, and basic protein studies in solution.
