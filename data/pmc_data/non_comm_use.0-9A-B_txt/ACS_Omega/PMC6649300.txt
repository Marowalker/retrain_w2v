Six Mn-Schiff base
complexes, [Mn(X-salpn)]0/+ (salpn
= 1,3-bis(sal-ic-ylidenamino)propane, X = H [1], 5-Cl
[2], 2,5-F2 [3], 3,5-Cl2 [4], 5-NO2 [5], 3,5-(NO2)2 [6]), were synthesized and characterized
in solution, and second-sphere effects on their electrochemical and
spectroscopic properties were analyzed. The six complexes catalyze
the dismutation of superoxide with catalytic rate constants in the
range 0.65 to 1.54 × 106 M–1 s–1 obtained through the nitro blue tetrazolium photoreduction
inhibition superoxide dismutases assay, in aqueous medium of pH 7.8.
In solution, these compounds possess two labile solvent molecules
in the axial positions favoring coordination of the highly nucleophilic
O2•– to the metal center. Even
complex 5, [Mn(5-(NO2)salpn) (OAc) (H2O)], with an axial acetate in the solid state, behaves as
a 1:1 electrolyte in methanolic solution. Electron paramagnetic resonance
and UV–vis monitoring of the reaction of [Mn(X-salpn)]0/+ with KO2 demonstrates that in diluted solutions
these complexes behave as catalysts supporting several additions of
excess O2•–, but at high complex
concentrations (≥0.75 mM) catalyst self-inhibition occurs by
the formation of a catalytically inactive dimer. The correlation of
spectroscopic, electrochemical, and kinetics data suggest that second-sphere
effects control the oxidation states of Mn involved in the O2•– dismutation cycle catalyzed by complexes 1–6 and modulate the strength of the Mn-substrate adduct
for electron-transfer through an inner-sphere mechanism.

Introduction
The superoxide radical
anion (O2•–) is generated by the
one-electron reduction of O2 during
normal cellular metabolism and constitutes the primary source of the
deleterious hydroxyl radical (HO•) and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2). Manganese superoxide dismutases
(SODs) catalyze the conversion of intracellular O2•– into O2 and H2O2 and constitute one of the major antioxidant defense systems
against this toxic metabolite.1 The active
site of these enzymes contains one Mn ion bound to three histidine
ligands, one aspartate and water or hydroxide as the fifth ligand
in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, and carries out O2•– disproportionation through a redox process
involving one-electron oxidation and reduction of the metal ion between
Mn(II)/Mn(III) levels.2 In a number of
neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, the production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) exceeds the antioxidant defenses and results
in tissue injuries.3,4 In this context, efforts have
been directed toward the search of low-molecular-weight SODs 
mimics as catalytic agents for the prevention of oxidative stress
disturbances.5−8 Several Mn-based complexes have shown protective efficacy for ROS-associated
pathologies9,10 and better bioavailability than
exogenous SOD enzymes.11 Among them, Mn
complexes of the salen (1,2-bis(salicylidenamino)ethane) family have
been tested in several animal models.12−14 The SOD activity of
mononuclear Mn-Schiff-base complexes has been extensively studied.15 However, the mechanism of the catalyzed O2•– dismutation by these compounds,
the influence of second-sphere effects—which can be crucial
for determining the reactivity of biomimetic metal complexes,16,17 and even the oxidation states involved in the catalytic cycle remain
exiguously understood. Although a Mn(II)/Mn(III) cycle during catalysis
has been invoked,18 the key features for
their activity (intermediates or active species formed upon reaction
with O2•–) are still elusive.
In this work, we try to answer two questions that remain open: do
the Mn-Schiff base complexes react with O2•– through an outer or inner sphere mechanism? Are the redox potential
of these complexes key for their reactivity? For this, we correlate
the redox and spectroscopic properties of a series of Mn-X-salpn complexes
(Figure 1) with their
SOD activity, aimed at unraveling some clues for their mode of action
to face O2•–.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the
Complexes
X-ray structures
of complexes 1–4 have been reported previously.
In these compounds, the metal ion is in the Mn(III) oxidation state
with the ligand disposed in the equatorial plane and two capping water
molecules occupying the trans-diapical positions.19−23 The IR spectra of these complexes show the fingerprint
typical of the ligands with the C=N bond stretching shifted
to frequencies lower than in the ligand denoting coordination to the
metal ion and intense bands corresponding to the counter anions (Figure S1). In aqueous or methanolic solution,
these complexes behave as 1:1 electrolytes and can be formulated as
[Mn(X-salpn)(solv)2]+. Electrospray ionization
(ESI)-mass spectra of the complexes in methanol show one main peak
(positive mode, Figure S2) belonging to
[Mn(X-salpn)]+, and the paramagnetic 1H NMR
spectra of the four compounds in D4-methanol exhibit a
common pattern outside the diamagnetic region (Figure S3). One broad signal at 19 ppm attributed to the central
methylene of the −(CH2)3– aliphatic
chain, and one (H4/H4′ in 2, 3, 4) or two (H4/H4′ and H5/H5′ in 1) upfield resonances belonging to the aromatic ring protons, a probe
for the symmetrically arranged tetradentate Schiff-base ligand in
the equatorial plane.24,25 The −N=CH–
imino H appears at −95 ppm for complex 1 and −106
ppm for 4 (shown in the inset of Figure S3). Other protons adjacent to the donor groups of
the Schiff base ligand (aromatic H3/H3′ and H6/H6′ and
−CH2–N=C) are not observed in the 1H NMR spectra (rapid relaxation or very large chemical shift).19,24,26

Complex 5 was
synthesized by adding Mn(OAc)2·4H2O to
the fully deprotonated ligand. Under these conditions, acetate binds
to the Mn ion affording the neutral [Mn(5-(NO2)salpn)(OAc)(H2O)] (5). The X-ray diffraction structure of 5 (not reported previously) shows the hexacoordinated Mn(III)
center adopting a pseudotetragonal geometry, with the N2O2-donor atoms from the tetradentate 5-(NO2)salpn ligand in the equatorial plane, and the apical positions occupied
by one O atom from a monodentate acetate ion and one capping water
molecule (Figure 2).
The coordination sphere of Mn exhibits an elongated octahedral geometry,
with the equatorial Mn–N/O bond distances (Mn–O/N(av) 1.958 Å) shorter than the apical Mn–O ones
(Mn–O(av) 2.216 Å), typical of the Jahn–Teller
distorted d4 Mn(III) ion. The complex
behaves as a 1:1 electrolyte in methanol, indicating that acetate
dissociates in the protic solvent.

Complex 6 is a Mn(II) complex formulated
as [Mn(II)(3,5-(NO2)2-salpn)(H2O)2], which in
methanol behaves as a non-electrolyte (same conductivity as for the
neat solvent), indicating that the compound remains neutral in solution.
The ESI-mass spectrum of a solution of 6 in DMSO shows
one main peak (positive mode, Figure S2) that can be assigned to the in situ oxidized [Mn(3,5-(NO2)2-salpn)(DMSO)(H2O)]+ counterpart.

The oxidation state of Mn in the six compounds was confirmed by
perpendicular-mode electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.
Complexes 1–5 are EPR-silent in frozen DMSO solutions,
a fact consistent with the presence of d4 Mn(III) ions with high zero-field splitting values.27,28 In contrast, complex 6 exhibits a six-line EPR signal
(hyperfine splitting of ∼90 G) at g = 2 and
two weak resonances on the low-field side at g ≈
3 and 5, characteristic of Mn(II) (shown below in Figure 8a) with zero-field splitting
slightly weaker than the X-band microwave frequency.29−32

Effect of the Substituents on the Reduction Potentials of Complexes 1–6
Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate
the electrochemical properties of complexes 1–6 in dimethylformamide (DMF) (Figure 3). The six complexes exhibit a quasi-reversible wave
corresponding to the Mn(III)/Mn(II) redox couple, with ΔEp in the range 69–108 mV for complexes
with unsubstituted and halogen-substituted ligands, and larger ΔEp values for the nitro-derivatives (Table S1). For all the six complexes, the Ipa/Ipc ratio is
within the range 0.89–1.00. These data indicate quasi-reversible
electrochemical processes. The phenol ring substituents span the redox
potentials (E1/2, Table 1) of the Mn(III)/Mn(II) couple from −0.153
to 0.476 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the electron-withdrawing
ability of the substituent increases. The plot of E1/2 versus the combined Hammett parameters of the substituents
ortho and para to the phenolate (Σσ)33 yields an excellent linear correlation (Figure 3). This means that both substituents
modulate the oxidation state of the Mn ion. This is especially evident
for complex 6, where the introduction of the second NO2 group increases the potential enough to stabilize the Mn(II)
oxidation state. Besides, for complex 5 it should be
expected that the axial acetate has an effect on the Mn(III)/Mn(II)
redox couple. However, the redox potential of 5 does
not move away from the linear trend, suggesting that even in DMF the
acetate dissociates.

Effect of the Substituents
on the Charge Transfer Band in the
Electronic Spectra
UV–vis spectroscopy shows that
the substituent on the phenolato influences the energy of the charge
transfer (CT) transitions of Mn-X-salpn complexes and provides a clear
correlation between the ligand donor ability and the electron density
of the metal center in these complexes. Electronic spectra of complexes 1–6 were registered in the aqueous phosphate buffer
employed for the SOD tests (Figure 4a). Spectra taken immediately and 30 min (the illumination
time used in the SOD tests) after preparation of solutions of 1–4 were virtually identical, meaning the complexes
are stable in the buffer during the reaction time. Absorptions between
350 and 450 nm correspond to ligand to metal CT (LMCT) transitions
from a pπ orbital of the phenolato oxygen to the partially filled
dπ orbitals of the Mn ion.34,35 For complexes 5 and 6, the intense absorption bands of the
nitro groups overlap the CT transitions and preclude their observation.
The LMCT energy values across compounds 1–4 of
this series decrease as the electron-withdrawing character of the
substituents increases: 27 173 cm–1 (ε
= 6450, 1 (H)) > 26 595 cm–1 (ε = 5900, 2 (5-Cl)) > 26455 cm–1 (ε = 8300, 3 (3,5-diF)) > 25 445 cm–1 (ε = 8350, 4 (3,5-diCl)). The
plot of the LMCT energy values against the combined Hammett parameter
of the substituents gives a good linear correlation (Figure 4b), highlighting these ligands
are predominantly π-donor: the stronger the electron-withdrawal
from the Ophenolato, the weaker π-donor ability of
the ligand (partially filled dπ* orbitals lying at lower energy).

spectra of complexes 1–6 in
phosphate buffer of pH 7.8. [Complex] = 0.02 mM. (b) Plot of the energy
of the LMCT bands of 1–4 against Σσ.

Effect of the Substituents
on the Chemical Shift of the Aromatic
H4/H4′ Protons in 1H NMR Spectra of Complexes 1–4
The isotropically shifted NMR resonances
of aromatic H4/H4′ protons of 1–4 in D4-methanol are compared in Figure 5. Given the low solubility of complexes 5 and 6 in methanol, these compounds were not
analyzed by this technique. As stated above, the 1H NMR
spectral pattern of 1–4 indicates that in solution
these complexes retain the trans-diaxial geometry with the tetradentate
Schiff-base ligand symmetrically arranged in the equatorial plane.24,25,36,37 In these complexes, the phenolato protons are expected to be predominantly
influenced by two contact shift pathways involving spin-delocalization
onto the phenyl ring through the imino N-donor and phenolato O-donor
atoms that generate upfield-shifted aromatic proton signals with large
relaxation values.24,38 The chemical shift of H4 correlates
with the combined Hammett parameter of the substituents, moving downfield
with the increased electron-withdrawal effect of the substituents.
The H4 resonance can be used as a signature of the effect of substituent
for this kind of compounds; therefore, more positive (or less negative)
chemical shifts are expected for the NO2-derivatives.

Effect of the Substituents
on SOD Activity of 1–6
The redox potential
of the six complexes fall in between
the potentials for the O2•– one
electron reduction and oxidation: E(O2•–/H2O2) = 0.642 V
(vs SCE at pH 7) and E(O2/O2•–) = −0.404 V (vs SCE at pH 7),
respectively, so they are expected to be active for O2•– dismutation. The SOD activity of complexes 1–6 was evaluated in phosphate buffer of pH 7.8 using
an indirect assay, which involves inhibition of the reduction of nitro
blue tetrazolium (NBT) by O2•–. In this assay, reaction of photoreduced riboflavin with O2 generates O2•– that converts
the colorless NBT into purple formazan, measured at 560 nm. The SOD
activity of the mimics is inversely related to the amount of formazan
and the six complexes showed increasing inhibition of the reduction
of NBT as their concentration raised (Figure 6a).

Figure 6 (a) SOD activity of complexes 1 (red), 2 (black), 3 (blue), 4 (orange), 5 (pink), and 6 (dark yellow)
in the riboflavin–methionine–NBT
assay. (b) Influence of the substituent in complexes 1–6 on kMcF.

The IC50 values (the concentration of the SOD
mimic
that diminishes by 50% the speed of reduction of NBT) were evaluated
graphically and used to calculate the McCord–Fridovich second-order
rate constants, kMcF = kNBT [NBT]/IC50 (Table 1). These kMcF values are independent of the detector concentration and suitable
to compare with literature values.39−47 Complexes 1–6 react faster than the Mn-X-salen
analogues, for which only one kMcF value
has been reported for the full series in spite of the variation in
their redox potentials,39−41 but react slower than water soluble
Mn(III) complexes of sulfonato-derived Schiff base ligands even when
the last are negatively charged.43−45 In any case, Mn-Schiff
base complexes with −(CH2)3– spacer
in the diimino fragment show higher SOD activity than analogues with
the shorter −(CH2)2– alkyl chain
([Mn(salpn)]+ vs [Mn(salen)]+; [Mn(5-SO3-salpn)]− vs [Mn(5-SO3-salen)]−; Mn(pyr2pn)]+ vs [Mn(pyr2en)]+), probably because the bending of salpn ligands
leads to a weakly coordinate exchangeable axial solvent molecule which
favors substrate binding. Besides, the SOD activities of these Mn-Schiff
base complexes are in the same range as for Mn-amine/pyridine complexes.15,48

The plot of log(kX/kH) against the combined Hammett parameters of substituents
(Figure 6b), where kX/kH is the ratio
between kMcF of X-substituted and the
unsubstituted Mn complex, shows that the rate of the reaction of the
Mn(III) complexes with O2•– decreases
as the electron-withdrawal effect of the substituents increases. Because
the complexes with the more electron-withdrawing substituents are
more difficult to oxidize, the observed trend suggests that oxidation
of the catalyst with simultaneous O2•– reduction should be the rate-limiting step in the reaction.49,50 It must be noted that the diNO2 complex (6) reacts faster than expected probably because this complex catalyzes
O2•– dismutation through a different
redox cycle (see below). On the other hand, the trans-effect of bound
acetate in complex 5 is expected to increase the O2•– reaction rate.51 However, it follows the trend and reacts slower than complexes 1–4. Dissociation of the apical acetate ligand in the
aqueous buffer medium explains this, in line with its electrolytic
behavior in methanol.

EPR and UV–Vis Monitoring of the Reaction
of Mn-X-Salpn
Complexes with KO2
KO2 is rather stable
toward self-dismutation in DMSO, so this solvent was chosen to follow
the reaction of Mn-X-salpn complexes with superoxide. We selected
complexes 1 and 5 (with the highest and
lowest kMcF values in this series) and 6 (in a different starting oxidation state) for the EPR monitoring
of their reaction with KO2. As stated before, 1 is EPR-silent in perpendicular mode, whereby this technique is particularly
useful to detect species in different oxidation states generated during
the redox reaction. [1]/[KO2] 1:1 ratio was
used in the EPR measurements. The 9 GHz band EPR spectra registered
during and at the end of the reaction are shown in Figure 7. Thirty seconds after addition
of O2•– to 1.25 mM 1, the EPR spectrum exhibits a 16-line signal centered at g = 2 typical of a di-μ-oxo-bridged Mn(IV)Mn(III)
species.31,52−55 The signal is still present at
1.5 min (Figure 7b)
but its intensity decreases with time and finally disappears (Figure 7c). This final product
could be a Mn(III), Mn(III)2, or Mn(IV)2 complex,
inactive in EPR. To gain insight into the nature of the final product,
the reaction of 1.25 mM 1 + 1.3 mM KO2 was
also monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy. The spectral pattern
of the starting complex was immediately lost and new bands grew up
(Figure 7d), with an
intense absorption band around 500 nm characteristic of the formation
of a bisoxo-bridged diMn(IV) dimer.23,56 The spectral
features of the spectrum of the reaction product are very close to
those of an authentic sample of [Mn(O)(salpn)]2 (Figure 7b(iii)) independently
prepared and measured at the same final concentration as the diluted
reaction mixture. The spectrum remained unchanged after 24 h, suggesting
that this is the thermodynamic product of the reaction. Therefore,
under these conditions (high concentration of complex), the monomer
converts into the dimer quantitatively—as quantified spectrophotometrically
against authentic [Mn(O)(salpn)]2. The formation of [Mn(O)(salpn)]2 was confirmed by ESI-MS (Figure S4). Under the same conditions, EPR monitoring of the reaction of 5 (0.75 mM) and KO2 (1.1 mM) showed the growth
up of the Mn(III)(μ-O)2Mn(IV) 16-lines signal (Figure 8e) after a few minutes and its disappearance at longer times.

2 min 30 s; (f) comparison
of EPR signals observed during the reaction of 1 (red), 5 (pink), and 6 (dark yellow) with KO2 in DMSO. T = 115 K.

The reaction of 6 (1.6 mM) and KO2 in DMSO
was also monitored by EPR spectroscopy. The six-line signal of the
starting Mn(II) complex (Figure 8a) disappeared immediately after mixing and converted
into a broad signal (width = 1260 G) centered at g = 2 (Figure 8b,c)
that remained several minutes and then cleared up. In this case, solid
KO2 was added to the solution of complex in DMSO, so the
signal of unreacted KO2 (g∥ = 2.1021, g⊥ = 2.003)57 is observed in the spectra. The O2•– signal is still present when the broad
signal disappears and holds during several hours. The broad unresolved
signal observed in the 6 + KO2 reaction (the
signals of intermediates formed by reaction of 1, 5, and 6 with KO2 are compared in Figure 8f) suggests that
the dimerization process does not occur through a Mn(III)Mn(IV) intermediate,
as in the case of 1 and 5.

To check
if the formation of the dimer was related to the initial
concentration of the starting complex, a more diluted sample of 1 was treated with KO2 in DMSO and the reaction
was followed spectrophotometrically. After addition of 1.5 mM KO2 to 0.04 mM 1 in DMSO, the CT band of the starting
complex (red line in Figure 9a) shifted 17 nm toward longer wave lengths (black lines in Figure 9a) and its intensity
increased. The intensity of the band at 395 nm depends on [O2•–], growing with higher [O2•–] (Figure 9b). At longer times, this band vanishes and gives rise
to a band shifted toward shorter wavelengths (orange line in Figure 9a) which remains
unchanged with time. This final species, which could correspond to
a Mn(III) dimer,24 is still active, as
second and third additions of excess KO2 cause the growth
of the band at 395 nm and consumption of KO2.

electronic spectra during the reaction of 1 and KO2 in DMSO. [1] = 0.04 mM;
[KO2] = 1.5 mM. Black lines: spectra taken during 40 min;
red line: starting complex; orange line: spectrum registered after
24 h. (b) Compared UV–vis spectra for the reaction of 0.044
mM 1 and different concentrations of KO2,

Two important observations can be pointed out from these
results:
first, in the less concentrated solutions of 1, the Mn(IV)
dimer does not form (no band at 500 nm characteristic of a dimer is
observed) and, second, the complex acts as a catalyst, because it
reacts with excess O2•–. Therefore,
catalyst self-inhibition occurs at high complex concentrations by
the formation of the catalytically inactive dimer, while in diluted
solutions the complex behaves as a catalyst supporting several additions
of excess O2•–, which validates
concentrations employed in the SOD assays.

Proposed Mechanism for
the Reaction of Mn-X-Salpn Complexes
with KO2
A complex with the metal-centered redox
couple closest to the midpoint between the oxidation and reduction
of O2•– (0.12 V vs SCE) is expected
to be a more potent SOD mimic than a complex with a farther redox
potential.15 This is essential when the
reaction of O2•– with the complexes
follows an outer sphere electron-transfer process. However, it seems
not to be the case for Mn-X-salpn complexes because those complexes
with redox potentials closed to 0.12 V react slower than 1 and 6. The nucleophilicity of O2•– and the presence of labile solvent molecules in the axial positions
of complexes 1–6 favor coordination of O2•– followed by an inner-sphere electron-transfer
mechanism, such as observed for other Mn complexes with the ligand
(either cyclic or acyclic) disposed in the equatorial plane.58−60 In such a mechanism, the variation of the electronic properties
of the substituents can control the dismutation rate by modulating
the strength of the Mn–O bond in the Mn–O2+ adduct. Therefore, electron-withdrawing substituents
attenuate the activity of the complex, giving rise to a weaker Mn–O2+ bond that leads to slower electron-transfer rate.
It is expected that Mn-X-salpn complexes with electron-donor substituents
lead to a stronger Mn–O2+ with higher
activity. At present, we are performing density functional calculations
on X-salpn-Mn+ and X-salpn-Mn-O2+ to confirm this hypothesis. On the basis of spectroscopic and kinetic
results, the mechanism of Scheme 1 is proposed. At low complex concentrations, where
the complexes catalyze O2•– dismutation,
the starting complexes 1–5 may react with O2•– to form the Mn(IV)-peroxo adduct61 which upon reaction with a second O2•– affords Mn(III)-peroxo and O2. Proton-assisted release of HO2– can
then take place to restore Mn(III).62 This
last step is fast in the aqueous medium of the SOD assay but much
slower in DMSO, where the source of H+ is the molecules
of water originally present in the starting complexes. In DMSO, when
the concentration of complex is ≥0.75 mM, the Mn(IV)-peroxo
adduct formed in the first step can react with the Mn(III) complex
to generate the Mn(III)Mn(IV) mixed valence complex (16-lines EPR
spectra in Figures 7a and 8) by nucleophilic attack of the peroxo
ligand on the Mn(III) center, which then evolves to the final Mn(IV)
dimer (UV–vis spectrum in Figure 7d(ii)).

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Reaction
of 1–5 with
KO2
For 6, a lower redox cycle is proposed (Scheme 2) based on the oxidation state
of Mn in the starting complex and the high redox potential expected
for the Mn(III)/Mn(IV) couple. In the first step, reaction of 6 with O2•– should lead
to formation of a Mn(III)-peroxo adduct, which reacts with a second
O2•– radical to generate O2 and Mn(II)-peroxo, followed by protonation to restore Mn(II)
and release of HO2–. At higher complex
concentration, the formation of a Mn(III)Mn(II) mixed valence complex
is also possible through the nucleophilic attack of the Mn(III)-peroxo
to the Mn(II) center of 6.48,63 The disappearance
of the broad signal in the EPR spectra taken at long times suggests
that the mixed valence dimer finally yields a homovalent one, probably
a Mn(III) dimer.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for the Reaction of 6 with KO2
In conclusion, second-sphere effects of the substituents
in Mn(III)-X-salpn
complexes modulate the redox potentials of the metal center and the
metal–ligand bond strength and guide their reactivity with
O2•–. Given the correlation between
rates and redox potentials and the spectroscopic evidence for the
formation of higher valence Mn complexes upon reaction with O2•–, the dismutation of O2•– catalyzed by 1–5 is
proposed to involve Mn(III)/Mn(IV) oxidation states through an inner-sphere
mechanism, where coordination of superoxide is critical. In complex 6, the two nitro groups shift the redox potential to positive
values enough to catalyze O2•– dismutation through the Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox couple. Therefore,
not only the redox potentials but also the coordination of superoxide
are key for the SOD activity of these complexes.

with care.

Physical Measurements
UV–visible
spectra were
recorded on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer, with thermostated cell
compartments. EPR spectra were obtained at 115 K on an Elexsys E 500
Bruker spectrometer, operating at a microwave frequency of approximately
9.5 GHz. IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One FT-IR
spectrophotometer. Solid samples were run in attenuated total reflectance
mode on a diamond crystal. Metal content was determined by atomic
absorption measurements on a Metrolab 250 AA spectrophotometer. ESI-mass
spectra were obtained with a Thermo Scientific LCQ Fleet. The solutions
for electrospray were prepared from solutions of the complexes diluted
with methanol or acetonitrile to a ≈10–5 M
concentration. Complex 6 was initially dissolved in DMSO
and then diluted with acetonitrile. 1H spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AC 300 NMR spectrometer at ambient probe temperature (ca.
26 °C). Chemical shifts are referenced to (CH3)4Si (1H NMR) and downfield shifts are given a positive
sign. Paramagnetic NMR spectra were acquired using super WEFT sequence,
with acquisition time of 23 ms. The electrochemical experiments were
performed with a computer-controlled Princeton Applied Research potentiostat,
VERSASTAT II model, with the 270/250 Research Electrochemistry Software.
Studies were carried out under Ar, in DMF solution using 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte and ≈10–3 M of the complexes. The working electrode was a glassy
carbon disk, and the reference electrode was a calomel electrode isolated
in a fritted bridged with a Pt wire as the auxiliary electrode. All
potentials are referred to the SCE electrode. Under these conditions, E(ferrocene/ferrocenium) = 474 mV, in DMF.

Indirect
SOD Assay
The SOD-like activity of the complexes
was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of the reduction of NBT
by O2•– spectrophotometrically.65 The reaction mixtures contained riboflavin (3.25
× 10–6 M), methionine (9.65 × 10–3 M), NBT (3.82 × 10–5 M), and complex (different
concentrations), in phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). Riboflavin was added
last and the mixtures were illuminated during 30 min with an 18 W
fluorescent lamp placed at 15 cm, at 25 °C. The reduction of
NBT was measured at 560 nm, and the IC50 values were determined
graphically. Control reactions confirmed that the compounds did not
react directly with NBT or riboflavin. Inhibition percentage was calculated
according to: {(ΔAbs/t)without complex – (ΔAbs/t)with complex} × 100/(ΔAbs/t)without complex. At 50% inhibition of NBT reduction, kMcF [complex] = kNBT [NBT], where kNBT (pH = 7.8) = 5.94 × 104 M–1 s–1, and kMcF can be calculated.50,66

EPR Measurements
in DMSO
A mixture of 1 (1.25 mM) and KO2 (1.2 mM) in DMSO was left to react
and aliquots were extracted at different times and frozen in N2(l) for EPR measurements. For 5 + KO2, the concentrations were 0.75 and 1.1 mM, respectively.

A
mixture of 0.16 mL of a DMSO solution of 6 (1.6 mM) and
0.1 mL of saturated solution of KO2 (with excess solid
KO2) was left to react and aliquots were extracted at different
times and frozen in N2(l) for EPR measurements.

Stock
KO2 solution in anhydrous DMSO was prepared by
mixing 9.3 mg of KO2 in DMSO (5 mL) and sonicated for 15
min, followed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm during 25 min. The concentration
of KO2 in the supernatant was estimated by using its extinction
coefficient 2686 M–1 cm–1 in deoxygenated
DMSO solution67 and confirmed by the horseradish
peroxidase assay.

Crystal Data Collection and Refinement
Single-crystal
data were collected on an Oxford Diffraction Gemini E CCD diffractometer
equipped with a sealed tube with Mo Kα radiation (λ =
0.71073 Å). Crystal structure data were corrected for absorption
with CrysAlisPro, Agilent Technologies, version 1.171.34.49, applying
an empirical absorption correction using spherical harmonics, implemented
in SCALE3 ABSPACK scaling algorithm. The structure was solved by Patterson
methods with SHELXS-9768 and refined by
full-matrix least-squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.69 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and
hydrogen atoms were added geometrically and refined as riding atoms
with a uniform value of Uiso. Crystal data collection and
refinement parameters for compound 5 are summarized in Table S2.
