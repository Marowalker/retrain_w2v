The preparation and characterization
of Ni(II) (1F) and Cu(II) (2F) complexes
of the ligand 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22-octafluoro-dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene
(LF) are here reported. These compounds have been characterized
by elemental analysis, mass and UV–vis spectroscopies, single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, and computational studies. The effects due to the
presence of fluorine atoms have been highlighted by comparison with
the analogous complexes of the ligand LH (Ni: 1H; Cu: 2H), which bears hydrogen atoms at the benzenoid
rings instead of fluorine. 1F and 2F are
isostructural, with the metal ions bound to the four nitrogen atoms
in a square-planar geometry and where the planar molecules are arranged
in a herringbone motif in the crystal lattice. Remarkable differences
in the intermolecular interactions between 1F and 2F and the corresponding H-complexes are shown by Hirshfeld
surface calculations. Moreover, the effects of fluorination on the
electronic structures have been investigated by density functional
theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations. The compounds with
LF and LH ligands present corresponding molecular
orbitals (MOs) with similar shapes. Furthermore, while the presence
of F-atoms lowers the energy of the MOs in comparison with those of
the LH complexes, it does not remarkably affect the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) and HOMO–LUMO + 1 gaps, in agreement with the
UV–vis results.

Introduction
Over the last few decades,
intense interest has been focused on
macrocyclic metal complexes toward their application in many different
fields. In particular, among this class of compounds, porphyrins and
phthalocyanines (Pc) have been extensively studied and demonstrated
as candidates for applications including catalysis,1 medicine,2 sensors,3 and as the active layer(s) in field-effect transistors4 and photovoltaic solar cells.5 These molecules are characterized by the planarity of the
core structure, which allows an extended electron-delocalization due
to 22 and 38 π-electrons for the porphyrin and phthalocyanine
ligands, respectively. Moreover, the planarity enables an overlap
of the π-orbitals between molecules, which plays a crucial role
in achieving good charge transport characteristics.6 In addition, the physical and chemical properties (such
as magnetism, photoluminescence, absorption, redox potentials) of
these macrocycles complexes can be finely tuned by changing the metal6,7 and/or the substituents at the periphery of the core.7−14 The addition of benzene rings to the phthalocyanine, for instance,
causes a red-shift of the intense absorption at the longest wavelength,8 whereas a switch from p-type to air-stable n-type
semiconductor behavior occurs when the peripheral hydrogen atoms are
substituted with fluorines.9,10,14 The exchange of a part or all of the C–H bonds with C–F
ones at the outer rim of the macrocyclic ligands also heavily affects
the ambient stability of the complexes,9,10 as well as
their catalytic15−17 and therapeutic properties.18 Moreover, the presence of fluorine atoms also changes the surface
tension, the thermal stability,11 and the
solubility of the molecules.13

The
remarkable changes observed in the chemical and physical properties
of a molecule when fluorine replaces hydrogen are mainly related to
the lower polarizability (αD: 3.76 vs 4.5)19 and the higher electronegativity (Pauling scale:
3.98 vs 2.10) presented by the halogen atom. For instance, the strong
electron-withdrawing capability of fluorine stabilizes the molecular
orbitals (MOs). The lowering in energy of the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) makes the molecule more stable versus oxidative degradation,
whereas the stabilization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) confers to the complex an acceptor capability manifested, in
some cases, by the behavior as an air-stable n-type semiconductor.20−22 Furthermore, the fluorination also has great influence on the intermolecular
interactions and therefore on the arrangement of the molecules in
the solid state, which can additionally affect the colligative properties,
such as charge transport.23,24

In comparison
to other macrocyclic ligands, such as phthalocyanines
or porphyrins, the dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes (Chart 1) and their metal complexes
have been less investigated.25 They have
been proposed as catalysts,26,27 catalase enzyme mimics,28−30 materials for recordable optical disks,31 and electrical conductors.32 Distinct
from the aforementioned macrocycles ligands, those belonging to the
class of dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes present a ring formed by 14
atoms; consequently, the core is smaller by about 0.1 Å compared
to those of porphyrins.33 Furthermore,
the macrocycle is less rigid, and the ligands and corresponding complexes
can show different conformations depending on the substituents on
the 1,3-propanediiminato moieties. In general, when R1 =
R1′ = R3 = R3′ = X
= H (Chart 1) the ligands
are planar,33−35 whereas if these positions are occupied by more-bulky
groups, the molecules adopt a “saddle-shaped” conformation26 due to the steric interactions of the substituents
with the benzenoid rings. This distorted conformation increases the
solubility and the chemical reactivity36 of these molecules but also influences the crystal packing, reducing
the π–π intermolecular overlaps and thereby hampering
good conducting properties in these complexes.

Chart 1 Recently, some of us
reported a study on the structural, electronic,
and magnetic properties of the complexes of three first row metal
+2 ions (Co, Ni (1H), and Cu (2H)) with
the dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes ligand (all R and X = H; LH).37 Thin-film electric transport properties
were also investigated, showing a p-type semiconductor behavior.

Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of Ni(II) and
Cu(II) complexes of the ligand 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22-octafluoro-dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene
(X = F; LF), which are analogues of LH, bearing
fluorine atoms at the benzenoid rings instead of hydrogen. The effects
due to this substitution on the crystal and electronic structures
are investigated by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and
density functional theory (DFT) and are highlighted by comparison
with the corresponding LH complexes. The results of this
study shed further light on the effect of fluorination of π-conjugated
systems, which are known to affect both the intramolecular energetics
and the intermolecular interactions. The reduced π–π
interactions in the present molecules allow the subtle effects of
fluorination on the packing and intermolecular contacts to be observed
and are here highlighted by detailed Hirshfeld surface (HS) analysis.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Crystal Structures
The two complexes
were prepared modifying a procedure already reported in the literature,38 mixing the perfluorinated ligand 3,4,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,2-phenylenediamine
(C6F4(NH2)2) with the
corresponding M(II) acetate salt in a 2:1 methanol/ethanol solution.
Other complexes of fluorinated dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene have been
previously reported: [Ni(cis-BTDMTAA)] (R1 = R1′ = methyl; R3 = R3′
= trifluoromethyl; Chart 1), [Ni(trans-BTDMTAA)] (R1 = R3′ = methyl; R1′ = R3 =
trifluoromethyl) and [Ni(OFTMTAA)] (R1 = R1′
= R3 = R3′ = methyl; X = F).39 These compounds, which were obtained in very
low yields (0.13–0.41%), were investigated as catalysts for
CO2 reduction; no crystal structures are available for
these complexes.

Crystals suitable for single-crystal structure
determination were grown by sublimation. A summary of crystallographic
data is reported in Table 1. The two complexes 1F and 2F are
isostructural and crystallize in the monoclinic P21/n space group. The molecules in the
crystals have a center of symmetry, and half of a molecule is crystallographically
independent.

Figure 1 shows the
crystal structure of 1F, whereas that of 2F is reported in Figure S1. In both cases,
the metal ion is bound to the four nitrogen atoms in a square-planar
geometry and the molecules are planar (Figure S2). The maximum (average) atomic displacements from the molecular
plane (defined by all nonhydrogen atoms) correspond to those of the
atoms F4 and are 0.056 (0.017) and 0.064 (0.022) Å for 1F and 2F, respectively. In the case of the unsubstituted
complexes, the average atomic deviations from the plane defined by
the nonhydrogen atoms in the two crystallographically independent
molecules are 0.041 and 0.014 Å for 1H and 0.024
and 0.040 Å for 2H.35,37 A summary
of the bond distances and angles is reported in Table 2. The Ni–N (Cu–N) distances
are 1.876(1) and 1.878(1) Å (1.937(3) and 1.938(3) Å), while
the average of N–C bond lengths is 1.336 (1.336 Å for 2F) and 1.408 Å (2F: 1.408 Å) for the
1,3-propanediiminato and benzenoid moieties, respectively, suggesting
a double bond character more pronounced for the former one. Moreover,
the N–C bond distances, as well as the C–C ones in the
propanediiminato linkages, are pairwise very similar, suggesting a
lack of single–double bond alternation and thus indicating
a π-delocalization within these fragments. Similar results were
found also for the unsubstituted free ligand40 and complexes.37 The bite angles (N–M–N)
related to the phenylenediamino moieties are 84.57(6) and 83.94(13)°
for 1F and 2F, respectively; these values
are slightly smaller than those found for 1H and 2H.35,37

The complexes pack forming columns perpendicular to
the ac plane, with alternating orientation of the
molecules
along the planes (101) and with the same orientation parallel to the ab and bc planes, conferring a herringbone
arrangement to the crystal packing (Figures 1 and S3). The
distances between adjacent molecules within a column are 3.30 Å
for 1F and 3.27 Å for 2F, whereas the
angles defined by two molecules differently oriented are 89.6 and
87.8° for the Ni and Cu complexes, respectively. The analogous
hydrogenated compounds show slightly shorter corresponding interplanar
distances (3.295 Å for nickel complex and 3.238 Å for the
copper one). Moreover, although 1H and 2H also pack with a herringbone-like arrangement, the motif is different
from that described above for the fluorinated complexes. Indeed, two
different herringbone arrangements alternating along a are present in the crystal structures, one for each crystallographically
independent molecule (Figure S4). The angle
formed by the molecules of the asymmetric unit in the nickel (copper)
complex is 52.16 (52.77°), while those between molecules of differently
oriented columns within planes parallel to the bc one are 78.14 and 78.29° (78.15 and 77.81°). Distinct
from 1H,35,37 no distances shorter than the
sum of van der Waals (vdW) radii are observed between molecules within
a stack for 1F, whereas four C···C contacts
(3.399 Å) per molecule exist in 2F. F–H (2.533
and 2.670 Å) and F–C (3.056 and 3.114 Å) short contacts
are present between a molecule and its neighbors in the adjacent columns
(Figure S5). Furthermore, as shown in Figures S6 and S7, the crystal structures of
unsubstituted and fluorinated compounds differ also in the overlap
between neighbor molecules, which is markedly more extended in the
case of 1F. However, considering the shorter distance
between the molecular planes in 1H, in addition to the
presence of C···C contacts (3.33 Å), which seems
to suggest a more favorable orbital overlap, stronger π–π
interactions are expected for 1H (see below the UV–vis
measurements discussion).

Hirshfeld Surface Analysis
Hirshfeld
surface (HS)41−43 studies have been performed to investigate the effect
of fluorination
on the solid-state interactions. The HSs of 1F (a) and 1H (b) mapped with the normalized contact distances (dnorm)42 are reported
in Figure 2 (the corresponding
copper complexes present similar results). The red, white, and blue
colors represent contact distances that are, respectively, shorter,
identical, and longer than the sum of the vdW radii (for a more accurate
definition of dnorm; see the Supporting
Information (SI)); therefore, the red spots
on the HSs correspond to the intermolecular short contacts mentioned
above (see also Figure S8). The differences
in the number and position of these spots between the HSs of 1F and 1H reflect the distinctions in their intermolecular
interactions. These differences in the intermolecular contacts are
clearly highlighted by a comparison between the Hirshfeld fingerprints
plots (FPs)44,45 shown in Figure 2c,d, which provide an overall two-dimensional
representation of the interactions occurring between the molecules
in the crystal (for details about the construction of the FPs; see
the SI or ref (44)). The FPs of 1F and 1H present remarkable differences. In particular, the fingerprints
of the fluorinated complex (Figure 2c) display two sharp peaks in the bottom left region
of the plot, which are related to the H···F interactions
in addition to two small regions due to the F···C contacts
(see also Figure S9). As expected, different
types of intermolecular contacts appear in the FP of 1H (Figure 2d), namely,
weak H···H interactions in the bottom left part of
the plot and the C···H ones in the two regions around
the points corresponding to de = 1.78
Å and di = 1.1 Å, and vice versa
(see Figures S10 and S11). The differences
in the intermolecular overlap mentioned above show up in the region
roughly in the center of the plot (de and di ∼ 1.8–2.0 Å), where a larger
interaction is seen for 1F, compared to 1H, in accordance with a more extended π–π overlap
in the case of 1F. These findings are also highlighted
by the curvedness (C) mapped onto the HS (Figures S12–S15). The fingerprint analysis
also allows a quantification of the contributions from the different
types of intermolecular contacts to the HS. Figure S16 shows a comparison between the percentage contributions
for fluorinated and hydrogenated complexes. One can notice that the
variation of the metal ion does not significantly affect the percentages,
whereas huge differences are observed varying the ligand. Indeed,
in 1H and 2H, the largest contribution is
by far that related to the H···H interactions (42.4
and 41.2%, respectively); furthermore, considering also the H···C
contacts (15.0% for 1H and 15.4% 2H), more
than half of the HS is due to contributions involving the hydrogen
atoms of the molecule. The effects of fluorine substitution on the
intermolecular interactions are confirmed by the percentage of contributions
involving the halogen atoms (F···X; X = F, C, H) in 1F and 2F, which are ≈41%. Those related
to C···X and H···X are approximately
18 and 21%, respectively.

and the corresponding fingerprint plots (c, d).

UV–Vis Measurements
UV–vis spectroscopic
measurements on the investigated complexes were performed in dimethylformamide
(DMF) solution (Figure 3). An intense absorption is present in the visible region at 400
nm for the nickel complex and at 394 nm for the copper one, with molar
extinction coefficients of 2.66 × 104 and 4.45 ×
104 dm3 mol–1 cm–1 for 1F and 2F, respectively. By time-dependent
(TD)-DFT calculations (vide infra), these bands have been assigned
mainly (77%) to a HOMO → LUMO + 1 transition for 1F, whereas in the case of 2F, several transitions contribute
to the absorption. The wavelengths corresponding to the band maxima
are quite similar to those observed in the case of unsubstituted complexes,
which fall at 425 nm for the 1H and 406 nm in the 2H case (see Figure S17). Furthermore,
less intense bands are present at lower (540 and 450 nm for 1F and 440 nm for 2F) as well as at higher energies
(297, 350, and 380 nm for 1F and 280 and 370 nm for 2F). A comparison between the diffuse reflectance spectra
is reported in Figure S18. As can be seen,
all three compounds investigated show an additional absorption at
red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The intensity and the extension
of these bands increase in the order 1F < 2F < 1H; this trend might be explained taking into
account the solid-state interactions, in particular those involving
π-systems. Indeed, as discussed above, although less extended
in comparison with those in fluorinated compounds, the π–π
interactions are stronger in the unsubstituted complex. Interesting,
especially in the 1H case, the solid-state absorption
covers continuously a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which
encompasses the whole visible region, as well as part of the ultraviolet
and the NIR. This behavior is characteristic of so-called “black
absorbers”, which are investigated for photovoltaic applications.46

DFT Calculations
With the aim of investigating the
effect induced by the fluorination on the electronic structures of
the complexes, computational investigation by DFT methods was performed.
The optimized geometries for compounds 1F and 2F, calculated in the gas phase, are reported in Figures S20 and S21. Differences in the planarity are observed
depending on the origin of the input file. Indeed, if the optimization
starts from the crystal data, the calculated structures are planar,
in accordance with those founded by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
However, calculations inputted with the file obtained from ArgusLab
program47 lead to optimized geometries
exhibiting a saddle-shaped conformation, in agreement with the findings
reported for 1H and 2H (Figure S22).37 The calculated total
energies of the corresponding conformers are very similar (see Figures S20 and S21), suggesting that the deformations
from planarity do not have important electronic effects. The almost
equivalence in the energies despite the different conformations might
be relatable to the negligible π-electron conjugation between
the phenyl rings and the N–(CH)3–N groups,
where the π-delocalization is not extended all over the cycle
but restricted within the propane-1,3-diiminato and benzenoid fragments,25 in agreement with the antiaromaticity (4n π-electrons) of these ligands.

The calculated
bond distances and angles for the planar conformation are in very
good agreement with the experimental ones (Table 2). Similar results (see Table S1) were found also in the case of the bent geometry
except, as expected, for the angle C2–Ni–C2′,
which is of 180.00 and 164.41° in the planar and saddle-shaped
conformation, respectively.

The frontier orbitals (FOs) calculated
for 1F and 1H are depicted in Figure 4 (see also Tables S2 and S3). As one can see, the fluorination does not
markedly affect the
overall shape of the FOs. The HOMO and LUMO are π-type orbitals,
involving atoms from both types of fragment of the ligand. The main
differences between 1F and 1H are seen in
the distinct contributions from the substituent at the benzene rings
(2–5% for 1F and 0 for 1H) (see Tables S4 and S5). As far as the other atoms
are concerned, the propane-1,3-diiminato chelate rings constitute
the majority of the FOs.

Figure 4 Frontier orbitals of 1F and 1H calculated
by DFT methods in the gas phase and plotted with a contour value of
0.040.

A more sizeable effect of the
fluorination is seen in the energy
of the MOs, in particular both HOMO and LUMO of 1F are
stabilized by about 0.70 eV in comparison with the corresponding 1H orbitals, whereas the LUMO + 1 orbital is lowered in energy
by 0.54 eV. As a consequence, comparable HOMO–LUMO and HOMO–LUMO
+ 1 gaps are expected for halogenated and unsubstituted complexes,
consistent with the experimental UV–vis spectra. Similar findings
were also observed for the compounds 2F and 2H (Tables S6–S11). Furthermore,
a comparison between the FOs of analogous complexes with different
metal ions highlights that their energy levels are almost unaffected
by changing the central atom (Table S12), in accord with the negligible metal contribution. Stabilization
effects close to those found for 1 and 2 were also observed with CuPc and the analogous perfluorinated complex
(F16CuPc).22 As already mentioned
in the Introduction, the effect of the fluorination
on the electronic structure of these complexes is related to the electronegativity
of F, which confers on this element a strong negative inductive effect
(σI = 0.51).24,48 Furthermore, fluorine
also shows positive mesomeric effect (σR = −0.34).24,48 Both of these factors affect the electronic structure, as well as
the intermolecular interactions.24

Electrostatic potentials (EPs) mapped onto the electron density,
as depicted in Figures 5 and S23, also highlight the fluorination
effect in the investigated complexes. The electron-withdrawing capability
of the halogen atoms indeed pulls the electron density from both types
of rings to the periphery of the molecule, causing a remarkable change
in the EP distribution. This redistribution toward the fluorine atoms
is particularly noticeable in the case of the π-cloud on the
benzene rings, which show negative EPs in 1H and positive
EPs in 1F. Similar effects on the electron density distribution
were reported for phthalocyanine complexes for which the substitution
with electron-withdrawing groups causes a decrease of electron density
in the inner ring π-system and may induce the switching from
p-type to n-type semiconductor behavior.14 As expected, these findings are in agreement with the observed intermolecular
interactions and confirm the role played by the fluorine atoms in
the crystal structures of these compounds. Indeed, in 1F, the fluorine atoms (negative EP) show short contacts with H and
C at the benzene rings (positive EP), whereas the unsubstituted complex
presents interactions involving hydrogen atoms and the partially negatively
charged aromatic carbons.

Figure 5 EPs mapped on electron density isosurfaces for 1F and 1H calculated by DFT (contour plot 0.001).
The colors are
mapped according to the electrostatic potential at the point in space
on the isosurface.

Moreover, looking closer
at the electron density distribution at
the fluorine atoms, it can be seen that there is no σ-hole (region
positively charged at the opposite side of the C–F bond) that
is necessary for the occurrence of halogen bonds.49 However, similar calculations performed on the analogous
chlorinated complex predict the presence of the σ-hole at the
halogen atoms (see Figure S24), suggesting
possible different solid-state interactions.

Conclusions
Complexes 1F and 2F have been prepared
and characterized by elemental analysis, mass and UV–vis spectroscopies,
single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and computational studies. The effects
due to the presence of fluorine atoms have been highlighted by comparison
with the analogous complexes 1H and 2H,
which bear hydrogen atoms at the benzenoid rings instead of fluorines. 1F and 2F are isostructural with the metal ion
bound to the four nitrogen atoms in a square-planar geometry, in planar
molecules arranged in a herringbone motif in the crystal packing.
Remarkable differences in the intermolecular interactions between 1F and 2F and the corresponding H-complexes are
shown by HS calculations. In particular, the fingerprints of the fluorinated
complexes show two sharp peaks related to the H···F
interactions, in addition to two small regions due to the F···C
contacts; on the whole, the percentage of contributions involving
halogen atoms in 1F and 2F is ≈68%.
The HS of the LH ligand is instead dominated by H···H
(≈42%), H···C (≈15%), and C···H
(≈21%) interactions. DFT optimized geometries are in very good
agreement with the experimental data. The calculated MOs of the complexes
with LF and LH present similar shapes, with
HOMOs and LUMOs that are π-type orbitals, involving atoms from
both types of fragment in the ligands. Furthermore, although the presence
of F-atoms lowers the energy of the MOs in comparison with those of
the LH complexes, it does not affect the HOMO–LUMO
and HOMO–LUMO + 1 gaps, in agreement with the UV–vis
results.

Experimental Section
All the reagents and solvents
were purchased from Aldrich and used
without further purification. The ligand 3,4,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,2-phenylenediamine
(C6F4(NH2)2) was prepared
as previously reported in ref (50). The reagent 2-propynal (2-propiolaldehyde) was synthesized
in accordance with the procedure reported by Sauer et al.51

Preparation
[Ni(LF)] (1F)
Synthesis: Complex 1 was prepared
by adapting the procedure already reported
in the literature for 1H.52 First, 216 mg (4.0 mmol) of 2-propiolaldehyde was dissolved in 5.0
mL of ethanol and added to a solution of 720 mg (4.0 mmol) of C6F4(NH2)2 in 15.0 mL of methanol/ethanol
2:1. The resulting solution was warmed to 50 °C, and then 498
mg (2.0 mmol) of [Ni(acetate)2]·4H2O in
10.0 mL of warm methanol was added dropwise. The mixture was refluxed
under stirring for 45 min and then cooled to room temperature. The
solid was collected by filtration, washed three times with methanol,
and dried in air. Next, 310 mg (yield 0.63 mmol; 31%) of product was
obtained. Analytical results are in accordance with the formula [Ni(LF)]. Elemental analysis: calculated for C18H6F8N4Ni (488.95): C 44.22, H 1.24, N
11.46; found: C 44.26, H 1.25, N 11.37. MS (EI): m/z (%) 488.0 (100.00%) [M+]. UV–vis
(in DMF; λ, nm (ε, dm3 mol–1 cm–1)): 297 (1.18 × 104); 350,
sh; 380, sh; 400 (2.66 × 104); 450, sh; 540, sh.

[Cu(LF)] (2F)
Synthesis: Complex 2F was prepared following the procedure reported above for
the analogous nickel complex using 218 mg (4.0 mmol) of 2-propiolaldehyde,
721 mg (4.0 mmol) of C6F4(NH2)2, and 399.6 mg (2.0 mmol) of [Cu(acetate)2]·H2O. First, 295 mg (yield 0.59 mmol; 29%) of product was obtained.
Analytical results are in accordance with the formula [Cu(LF)]. Elemental analysis: calculated for C18H6F8N4Cu (493.80): C 44.22, H 1.24, N 11.46;
found: C 43.59, H 1.31, N 11.28. MS (EI): m/z (%) 493.0 (100.00%) [M+]. UV–vis (in
DMF; λ, nm (ε, dm3 mol–1 cm–1)): 280, sh; 370, sh; 394 (4.45 × 104); 440, sh.

Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo
Erba CE1108 Elemental Analyser. MS were recorded on a ThermoElectron
MAT 900 by an electron impact (EI) ionization technique. The UV–vis–near-IR
spectra were measured with a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer equipped
with a diffuse reflectance accessory. Solution measurements (DMF)
were recorded using a quartz cell of path length 1 cm, while diffuse
reflection measurements were performed on KBr pellets.

Single-Crystal
X-ray Crystallography
All measurements
were made on a Rigaku Saturn CCD area detector with graphite monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 123 K. Data were
collected and processed using CrystalClear (Rigaku).52 The structures were solved by direct methods53 and expanded using Fourier techniques.54 The nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
Hydrogen atoms were refined using the riding model. All calculations
were performed using the CrystalStructure55 crystallographic software package except for refinement, which was
performed using SHELXL-97.56 Crystallographic
data of 1F and 2F are given in Table 1; more details about
single-crystal measurements are available in the Supporting Information
(SI).

DFT Calculations
Ground-state electronic structure
calculations were performed as previously reported57 at the DFT58 level employing
the GAUSSIAN 0959 software package and
using B3LYP as functional60,61 and the valence triple-ζ
6-311+G(d,p)62 as the basis set. The ground-state
geometries were optimized both in the vacuum and in a DMF-simulated
electric field; frequencies analyses were done to verify that the
optimized geometries are true minima. The 20 lowest singlet excited
states of the closed shell complexes 1H and 1F and the 40 lowest excited states of the open shell complexes 2H and 2F were calculated within the time-dependent
DFT calculations using the formalism as implemented in Gaussian.59 More details are given in the SI.

Hirshfeld Surface Analysis
The Hirshfeld
surface (HS)
analysis41 was performed as reported in
ref (63) and further
described in the SI; all the calculations
on the HS surface and its properties were performed by the CrystalExplorer
3.1 program.64
