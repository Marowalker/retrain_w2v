Bimetallic
nanocatalysts, with efficient and controllable catalytic
performance, have a promising application in chemical production.
In this study, surface Pt-rich bimetallic AuPt nanoparticles with
different Pt/Au ratios were prepared and tested in selective hydrogenation
reactions of substituted nitroaromatics. Au nanoparticles were first
prepared with n-butyllithium as a rapid reducer,
which were further used as seeds in the slow growth process of Pt
atoms. Because of the employed sequential reduction method and the
following atom diffusion, surface Pt-rich bimetallic AuPt nanoparticles
were obtained. Compared with the uniform AuPt alloy nanocatalysts
synthesized by the co-reduction method with n-butyllithium
as the reducer and monometallic Pt nanocatalysts, the obtained surface
Pt-rich AuPt bimetallic nanocatalysts presented an enhanced catalytic
selectivity or activity. The performance enhancement is assigned to
the optimized Au/Pt interaction in the surface Pt-rich bimetallic
nanostructures. This work demonstrates that the optimization of the
stoichiometry and construction of bimetallic materials is a feasible
method to synthesize controllable and efficient nanocatalysts.

1 Introduction
Metallic
nanocatalysts have been playing a significant role in
chemical industries; enhancing their catalytic performance is helpful
for reducing the production cost.1−4 With the unique characters of nanostructures,
such as the quantum effect and high surface/volume ratio, metallic
materials in nanoscale could present enhanced catalytic performance
than that of bulk counterparts.5 Bimetallic
nanoparticles (NPs) have widespread applications, such as biosensors,
biological medicines, wastewater treatments, and catalytic fields.6−11 Through modulating the distribution of surface electrons and active
sites, bimetallic nanocatalysts demonstrate a controllable performance.12−14 Various architectures of bimetallic nanoclusters have been prepared,
such as alloy NPs, core–shell NPs, and intermetallic compounds.15−18 Accordingly, the catalytic activity or selectivity can be enhanced
by optimizing the stoichiometry or construction of bimetallic structures.19−21 Typical alloy nanomaterials in bimetallic structure, with a uniform
distribution of metallic atoms, have been reported widely as efficient
catalysts.20 The nanoalloys displayed superior
catalytic activities in certain reactions, but the catalytic stabilities
of nanoalloys are lower than that of heterogeneous bimetallic nanostructures.
The reasonable explanation is the metallic atoms tend to migrate and
aggregate individually.22,23 Heterogeneous bimetallic
nanostructures refer to a nonuniform distribution of metallic elements,
like core–shell NPs, where the core is formed by one kind of
metal and the surrounding shell is formed by another kind of metal.24,25

In heterogeneous nanostructures, the most active metal atoms
usually
aggregate on the surface and the second metal forms the core or the
second metal atoms intersperse on active metal core, which would moderate
electronic effects of the active metallic atoms. For example,
Pd–Pt core–shell NPs were synthesized by depositing
a thin layer of Pt on the Pd seed surface. The catalytic performance
of Pd–Pt nanocatalysts was superior than that of monometallic
Pd or Pt nanocatalysts because of the interactions between the Pd
cores and Pt shells.26 Meanwhile, the density
functional theory calculations also verified that the intermetallic
effects in heterogeneous nanostructures could influence the catalytic
performance.27−29 There is a great amount of demand to design catalysts
with high catalytic activity and selectivity for various reactions.
Substituted nitroanilines, one kind of important and widely used chemicals,
can be produced by the selective hydrogenation of the substituted
nitroaromatics. Among the existing nanocatalysts, bimetallic nanocatalysts
tend to achieve higher selectivity and activity than monometallic
nanocatalysts.30 One strategy is blending
some kind of inert metal in overefficient noble metal to coordinate
the catalytic activity and selectivity for designing high efficient
bimetallic nanocatalysts. As reported, Au was inert in hydrogenation
reactions, which could be used as an additive to improve the selectivity
of Pt catalysts. Because of the synergetic effects between Au and
Pt atoms, bimetallic AuPt nanocatalysts present enhanced catalytic
selectivity.31−33

Accordingly, metallic precursors (Au3+ and Pt4+) can be reduced by sodium borohydride, polyol,
and other reducers
to synthesize bimetallic NPs by the wet chemistry method.34−37 Co-reduction methods are exerted to synthesize homogeneous alloys,
whereas successive reduction methods are used to synthesize heterogeneous
bimetallic materials.38,39 Recently, many ecofriendly synthesis
approaches have been used in bimetallic NP preparation.40−42 Wang and co-workers creatively used a facile theophylline-assisted
green approach without any template or seed to synthesize AuPt nanospheres
over graphene oxide.43,44 However, synthesizing bimetallic
NPs with controllable stoichiometry and construction is still being
a challenge. In this work, a series of AuPt bimetallic NPs were synthesized
containing homogeneous and heterogeneous structures with various Au/Pt
atom ratios. The specific preparation process and catalytic application
are illustrated in Scheme 1. During the process, n-butyllithium was chosen as the rapid
reducer to alloying Au and Pt atoms in tiny nanostructures around
5 nm. Strategically, Au NPs (∼5 nm) were first reduced by n-butyllithium and then used as seeds in the slow growth
process of Pt atoms. Because of the employed sequential reduction
method by oleylamine and following the diffusion of atoms, surface
Pt-rich bimetallic AuPt NPs were obtained. These as-synthesized bimetallic
AuPt NPs were deposited on alumina (γ-Al2O3) to form AuPt NPs/γ-Al2O3 nanocatalysts.
The bimetallic nanostructures were characterized by technologies such
as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy (UV–vis). The catalytic performance of the designed
nanocatalysts for selective hydrogenations of various substituted
nitroaromatics were tested, and the obtained surface Pt-rich AuPt
bimetallic nanocatalysts presented enhanced catalytic selectivity
or activity than uniform AuPt alloys and monometallic Pt nanocatalysts.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of a Series
of Bimetallic
AuPt Nanocatalysts
In this paper, homogeneous AuPt alloy
NPs were synthesized by the one-pot reduction method with n-butyllithium as the reducer. For heterogeneous AuPt bimetallic
NPs, n-butyllithium could rapidly reduce Au3+ to form Au NPs less than 5 nm. In the successive process, Pt4+ would be reduced gently by oleylamine to Pt atoms, which
would then grow on the Au seed surfaces. Oleylamine was not only the
reducer for Pt4+ but also the surfactant at the Au surface,
which was significant to overcome their rejection. Herein, the Pt
atoms could grow on the Au seeds rather than being aggregated alone.
The detailed synthesis process and characterization method are presented
in the Experimental Section and Supporting Information.

The XRD patterns
of heterogeneous AuPt bimetallic NPs (the atom ratios of Au/Pt are
1/0.5, 1/1, 1/1.5 and 1/2) prepared by the successive reduction method
are illustrated in Figure 1. Meanwhile, the pattern of the homogeneous Au/Pt alloy NPs
by the co-reduction method is also displayed. Because the XRD patterns
of Au and Pt are extremely near, the bimetallic AuPt NPs displayed
XRD patterns between the pure Au and pure Pt diffractions. There was
a meaningful consequence, where the peaks of XRD patterns shifted
gradually from Au diffraction to Pt diffraction, with the Pt ratios
improved. Such a result was associated with the TEM and UV–vis
adsorption measurements, verifying that the Pt atoms tend to enrich
on the Au surface.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of a series of bimetallic AuPt NPs; vertical
lines
indicate individual Au (JCPDS 04-0784) and Pt (JCPDS 04-0802).

The TEM images of monometallic Au NPs and AuPt
alloy NPs are shown
in Figure 2. A series
of heterogeneous AuPt bimetallic NPs with Pt enriched on the surface
(Au/Pt atom ratios of 1/0.5, 1/1, 1/1.5, and 1/2) are also illustrated
in Figure 2b–e.
As illustrated in Figure 2, the metallic nanomaterials synthesized by the wet chemistry
reduction method mentioned before are uniform spheres with diameters
around several nanometers. Figure 3 presents the statistical results of these NPs, which
came from nearly 100 randomly selected particles in the TEM images.
The diameters of Au, AuPt-1/0.5, AuPt-1/1, AuPt-1/1.5, AuPt-1/2, and
AuPt alloy-1/1 NPs are 4.16, 4.65, 4.92, 5.34, 6.02, and 3.89 nm,
respectively. Therefore, the rapid reduction method by n-butyllithium could synthesize monometallic NPs and alloy NPs in
a tiny size. The Au NPs with ∼4 nm diameter would be seeds
in the following step, on which Pt4+ were reduced gently
by oleylamine. As the Pt ratios increase, the size of heterogeneous
AuPt bimetallic NPs accordingly increased from 4.65 nm (AuPt-1/0.5)
to 6.02 nm (AuPt-1/2).

The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM
(HAADF-STEM) images
and the relative atomic proportions of Au and Pt by energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) line scanning for bimetallic AuPt-1/1.5 NPs are
shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows that one
independent particle was selected, and the atomic ratio of Au/Pt is
presented in Figure 4b. As demonstrated in the elemental analyzation, Au and Pt atoms
distribute nonuniformly in AuPt-1/1.5 NPs; the AuPt NPs synthesized
by the successive reduction method are heterogeneous and bimetallic
structures. EDS elemental maps can demonstrate the surface Pt-rich
bimetallic nanostructures visually. As displayed in Figure 4d,e, Au atoms tend to aggregate
in the core. The distribution of Pt is nonuniform, whereas the Pt
atoms on the surface are more than that on the core position. This
surface Pt-rich heterogeneous nanostructure can also be proved by Figure S1, which displays several AuPt-1/1.5
NPs. Meanwhile, the surface Pt-rich heterogeneous nanostructures of
AuPt-1/1 are also verified in Figure S2, as displayed in the HAADF-STEM image (Figure S2a) and EDS elemental maps of Au and Pt (Figure S2b,c).

image of AuPt-1/1.5 and EDS elemental maps of Au (d) and Pt (e).

As XPS is a surface-sensitive technology, the XPS
characterizations
are expected to verify whether the bimetallic AuPt nanostructures
are heterogeneous or homogeneous. A series of bimetallic AuPt NPs
were measured, and the resulted XPS spectra are presented in Figure 5 as an example showing
heterogeneous AuPt bimetallic NPs with Pt enriched on the surface
(the atom ratio of Au/Pt is 1/1.5). Accordingly, the binding energy
at 71.2/74.6 and 71.9/75.1 eV can be assigned to 4f7/2/4f5/2 of Pt0 and Pt2+ species, respectively,45 and the binding energy at 84.1/87.8 eV can be
assigned to 4f7/2/4f5/2 of Au0 species.46 Interestingly, an obvious portion of Pt is Pt2+ for heterogeneous AuPt bimetallic NPs. As the synthesis
process was carried out under a N2 environment and without
calcination in the following process, the existence of oxidized Pt
did not originate from the oxidation in air. It is attributed to the
transformation of electrons from the Pt shell to the Au core because
of the intermetallic effects.47 As mentioned
in many papers, the enhanced Pt0 ratio is crucial to superior
catalytic activity because the metallic state is more active than
Pt oxide.15,47−49 As the surface Pt-rich
bimetallic AuPt NPs display higher Pt0 ratio than the AuPt
alloy (Table 1), they
demonstrate superior catalytic activities for selective hydrogenation.

the proportions of Au and Pt in bimetallic NPs calculated from the
XPS spectra (Figure S3) by the XPS PEAK4.1
software. Meanwhile, the results from inductively coupled plasma–optical
emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) are also displayed, which are
associated with the ratios of Au and Pt precursors. According to the
ICP–OES results, the heterogeneous AuPt bimetallic NPs with
Pt enriched on the surface owned the atom ratios of Au/Pt near the
feeding ratios of 1/0.5, 1/1, 1/1.5, and 1/2. The actual loadings
are slightly lower than that of the calculations (Au-0.5 wt % on γ-Al2O3), which might originate from the loss caused
by the loading treatment and cleaning process. The XPS results illustrate
an Au-enriched core and Pt-enriched shell phenomenon, where the calculated
ratios of Pt to Au are always bigger than the ratio resulted from
the ICP–OES measurements. For example, the ratio of Au/Pt for
AuPt-1/1.5 is 1/2.96 from XPS, whereas it is 0.43/0.68 obtained from
ICP, which means the Pt atoms are almost on the surface and the bimetallic
AuPt NPs are heterogeneous structures.

As reported, an Au surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) band appears
at around 520 nm in the UV–vis absorbance spectra when monometallic
Au NPs are larger than 2 nm.50,51Figure 6 presents the UV–vis absorption spectra
of monometallic Au and heterogeneous AuPt bimetallic NPs (the atom
ratios of Au/Pt were 1/0.5, 1/1, 1/1.5, and 1/2, respectively). Accordingly,
the monometallic Au NPs display the clear SPR band at 522 nm, which
is attributed to the Au response. With the atom ratio of Pt to Au
increasing, the SPR band of Au decreases correspondingly. When the
atom ratio of Au/Pt is 1/2, the SPR band of Au disappeared, which
means Au NPs are covered by Pt atoms totally. The UV–vis adsorption
measurements suggest that the bimetallic AuPt NPs synthesized by the
successive method are heterogeneous structures, where Pt atoms are
enriched on the surface of Au seeds.

AuPt bimetallic NPs (the atom ratios of Au/Pt were 1/0.5, 1/1, 1/1.5,

2.2 Selective
Hydrogenation Abilities of a Series
of As-Synthesized Nanocatalysts
The catalytic performance
of the as-synthesized AuPt bimetallic nanocatalysts with a metallic
loading of 0.5 wt % on γ-Al2O3 was tested
in selective hydrogenation reactions for various substituted nitroaromatics
(as shown in Table 2). p-Chloronitrobenzene, p-nitrophenol, p-nitroanisole (p-NAS), p-nitrotoluene, p-nitroacetophenone, and o-nitroacetophenone were chosen in this research.

Table 2 Selective Hydrogenation Abilities
of a Series of As-Synthesized Nanocatalysts
Bimetallic AuPt nanocatalysts were synthesized through
a similar
reduction method to verify that the intermetallic effects in bimetallic
structures can modulate the catalytic performance. Under similar conditions,
the heterogeneous bimetallic nanomaterial demonstrated superior selective
hydrogenation ability than the alloy nanostructure for the six kinds
of substituted nitroaromatics. AuPt-1/1 can obtain a yield of o-aminophenone at 80.9% after hydrogenation at 45 °C
under atmospheric H2 for 2 h. As a reference, the AuPt
alloy-1/1 catalysts just obtained 43.3% yield. The controlled monometallic
Pt catalysts were prepared by the similar method with the same noble
metal loading (Experimental Section and Supporting Information). As displayed in Table S1, the selective hydrogenation performance
of Pt monometallic catalysts is inferior to the designed bimetallic
catalysts, where a part of Pt atoms is replaced by Au atoms. As an
example, Au/Pt-1/2 obtains a yield of o-aminophenone
at 97.5%, whereas the monometallic Pt catalysts just obtained 66.8%
under the same reaction conditions. Therefore, doping Au atoms can
enhance the selective abilities of Pt for the substituted nitroaromatics.
More importantly, the bimetallic nanostructures with Pt enriched on
the surface are superior to the alloy nanostructures.

The catalytic
stability of heterogeneous AuPt bimetallic nanocatalysts
(the atom ratio of Au/Pt is 1/1.5) was tested in the p-NAS hydrogenation reaction. After each cycle, the nanocatalysts
were centrifuged from the mixtures and washed for five times using
a mixed solution of acetone and ethanol and then dried in an oven
at 80 °C for 12 h. The weight of ethanol and p-NAS decreased according to the weight of the recycled nanocatalysts.
According to the data in Figure 7, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the heterogeneous
AuPt bimetallic nanocatalysts are stable, which means the designed
structures are equipped with superior stability.

AuPt bimetallic nanocatalysts (the atom ratio of Au/Pt is 1/1.5).

3 Conclusions
In this
work, a series of bimetallic AuPt NPs are designed and
their selective hydrogenation abilities for various substituted nitrobenzenes
are tested. The rapid co-reduction with n-butyllithium
as the reducer can obtain uniform AuPt alloy NPs; a sequential reduction
method with presynthesized Au NPs as seeds and the following atom
diffusion process would result in surface Pt-rich AuPt bimetallic
nanostructures. The surface Pt-rich bimetallic nanocatalysts with
different Au/Pt atomic ratios demonstrate enhanced hydrogenation selectivity
or activity than AuPt alloys and monometallic Pt nanomaterials. This
enhancement originates from the optimization of Au/Pt interaction
in surface Pt-rich bimetallic nanostructures. The strategy reported
here could be exerted to prepare more kinds of bimetallic nanocatalysts
with efficient and controllable catalytic performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Homogeneous
AuPt Alloy NPs
AuPt alloy NPs were synthesized by the co-reduction
method. For
obtaining AuPt alloy NPs with 1/1 Au/Pt atom ratio, 0.06 mmol of HAuCl4·xH2O and 0.06 mmol of H2PtCl6·xH2O were
dissolved in 1 mL of decalin and 2 mL of oleylamine. In a 50 mL three-necked
round-bottom flask, 20 mL of decalin was swept by a N2 flow
at 110 °C for 2 h to remove water and then cooled down to 75
°C. The solution containing Au3+ and Pt4+ precursors was injected to the 20 mL of decalin, followed by an
injection of 1 mL of n-butyllithium at 75 °C
and N2 atmosphere. The mixture was heated to 140 °C
quickly and maintained for 4 h under the N2 atmosphere.
The black resultant mixture was centrifuged and washed with the mixed
solution of toluene and acetone for four times to obtain homogeneous
AuPt alloy NPs.

4.2 Synthesis of Monometallic
Au NPs
HAuCl4·xH2O (0.06 mmol)
was dissolved in a mixed solution with 1 mL of decalin and 0.5 mL
of oleylamine. In a 50 mL three-necked round-bottom flask, 20 mL of
decalin was swept by a N2 flow at 110 °C for 2 h to
remove water and then cooled down to 75 °C. The Au3+ precursor solution was injected to the 20 mL of decalin, followed
by an injection of 0.5 mL of n-butyllithium at 75
°C and N2 atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at 75
°C for 0.5 h and then heated to 110 °C quickly and maintained
for 2.5 h. After the injection of n-butyllithium
at 75 °C, the Au3+ precursors were reduced, with the
clear solution changing to brown colloid. When the temperature increased
to 110 °C and maintained for 2.5 h, the color of the colloid
darkened to purple, indicating the growth of Au NPs. Once cooling
down to room temperature, the colloid containing Au NPs would be used
in the synthesis of AuPt bimetallic NPs with Pt enriched on the surface.
The as-synthesized Au NPs served as seeds to anchor the Pt atom. Meanwhile,
the monometallic Au NPs could be obtained from the colloid through
centrifugation and washed by the mixed solution of toluene and acetone
for four times.

4.3 Synthesis of Monometallic
Pt NPs
Similar to the aforementioned monometallic Au NPs
synthesis method,
0.06 mmol of H2PtCl6·xH2O was dissolved in a mixed solution with 1 mL of decalin
and 0.5 mL of oleylamine. In a 50 mL three-necked round-bottom flask,
20 mL of decalin was swept by a N2 flow at 110 °C
for 2 h to remove water and then cooled down to 75 °C. The Pt4+ precursor solution was injected to the 20 mL of decalin,
followed by an injection of 0.5 mL of n-butyllithium
at 75 °C and N2 atmosphere. The mixture was stirred
at 75 °C for 0.5 h and then heated to 140 °C quickly and
maintained for 4 h. After the injection of n-butyllithium,
the Pt4+ precursors were reduced, with the clear solution
changing to black colloid. Once cooling down to room temperature,
the colloid containing Pt NPs was stored in a spiral glass bottle
for subsequent washing and loading.

4.4 Synthesis
of Heterogeneous AuPt Bimetallic
NPs with Pt Enriched on the Surface in Different Atom Ratios
The bimetallic AuPt NPs with the surface enrichment of Pt were synthesized
by the successive reduction method. For synthesizing AuPt bimetallic
NPs in 1/1 Au/Pt atom ratio, 0.06 mmol of H2PtCl6·xH2O was dissolved in a mixed solution
with 1 mL of decalin and 4 mL of oleylamine. In the reactions that
followed, oleylamine would work as a solvent and as a slow reducer.
The mixture of the Pt4+ precursor and solution was injected
to the colloid containing Au NPs as seeds (the Au seeds were synthesized
as mentioned before) at room temperature. After this, the mixture
was heated to 140 °C and maintained for 4 h under a N2 atmosphere. The black resultant was centrifuged and washed by the
mixed solution of toluene and acetone for four times. The product
was collected and stored in a snail bottle for further characterization.
Under the same synthesis conditions, the bimetallic AuPt NPs in 1/0.5,
1/1.5, and 1/2 of Au/Pt atom ratios were synthesized by the adjustment
of the amount of the Pt precursors.

4.5 Synthesis
of Supported Nanocatalysts
With 0.5 wt % of metallic loading,
the calculated amount of metallic
NPs and γ-Al2O3 powders was dissolved
in 20 mL of cyclohexane. The mixture was placed in a 50 mL three-necked
round-bottom flask and heated continuously in an oil bath at 55 °C.
The left powders were washed for three times with a mixed solution
of acetone and ethanol and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for
12 h to obtain nanocatalysts where metallic NPs were supported on
γ-Al2O3.
