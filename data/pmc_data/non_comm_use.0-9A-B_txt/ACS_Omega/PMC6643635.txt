The viability of using [n]-cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different sizes to encapsulate diquat
(DQ) pesticide molecules has been tested analyzing the origin of the
host–guest interactions stabilizing the complex. This analysis
provides rational design capabilities to construct ad hoc capturing
systems tailored to the desired pollutant. All CPPs considered (n = 7–12) are capable of forming remarkably stable
complexes with DQ, though [9]-CPP is the best candidate, where a fine
balance is established between the energy penalty due to the deformation
+ repulsion of the pesticide molecule inside the cavity (larger in
smaller CPPs) and the maximization of the favorable dispersion, electrostatic
and induction contributions (which also decrease in larger rings).
These encouraging results prompted us to evaluate the potential of
using Resonance Raman spectroscopy on nanohoop complexes as a tool
for DQ sensing. The shifts observed in the vibrational frequencies
of DQ upon complexation allow us to determine whether complexation
has been achieved. Additionally, a large enhancement of the signals
permits a selective identification of the vibrational modes.

1 Introduction
A pesticide
can be defined as any substance intended to prevent, control, or destroy
any pest that causes damage or interferes with the production, processing,
storage, transport, or commercialization of foodstuffs. The use of
pesticides is a hotly debated topic.1−4 Defenders usually appeal to various benefits
such as control of pests and plant disease vectors, a fact that leads
to improved crop yields, better crop quality, and control of harmful
invasive species. The control of losses in crop production improves
the harvest, which leads not only to farm and agribusiness revenues,
increased export returns, and, in general, an economic activation
of the primary sector, but also to higher arable land productivity
ratios. Pesticides also allow us to control organisms that harm obtaining
wood from trees, shrubs, leaves, or resins. Lastly, the use of pesticides
is of vital importance for the control of human/livestock disease
vectors and nuisance organisms, a fact that has reduced the number
of deaths and human and animal suffering across the planet.

However, there are also numerous drawbacks related to the use of
pesticides. The use of chemical substances for the control of pests
is inextricable with associated risks to the environment, workers,
and consumers that are increased by their indiscriminate use and bad
in situ applications. It must be kept in mind that once applied, pesticides
do not stay put and can pollute the environment. Some authors indicate
that over 98% of aerial and terrestrial sprayed insecticides and around
95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species
and end up in the air, surface or ground water, soil, food-chain,
and so forth.4 Some consequences are the
reduction of biodiversity, the contribution to pollinator decline,
and the decrease of the quality of fresh water. Perhaps, the two issues
producing most concerns in this field are the emergence of resistance
(resulting in the need of higher concentrations or the development
of new, more aggressive, compounds) and damage to human health. Resistance
to pesticides is a large scale problem that can develop in a very
short period of time. In terms of public health, pesticides may cause
both acute and delayed health effects in people who are regularly
exposed to them. It should be noted that in many cases pesticide metabolites
are more toxic and persistent than the original molecule.

In
this work, we will focus on herbicides, more specifically in the family
of quaternary ammonium compounds, better known as quats. There are
numerous molecules belonging to this family available on the market
such as cyperquat, mepiquat, chlormequat, and difenzoquat although,
perhaps, the best known and widely used in the world are paraquat
[PQ] and diquat [DQ] (6,7-dihydrodipyrido[1,2-a:2′,1′-c]pyrazine-5,8-diium). Some of the crops in which these
herbicides are used are beet, soybeans, grapevines, alfalfa, sugar
beet, and potato.5 Quats are known to act
on photosystem I, which produces free electrons to drive photosynthesis.
The free electrons of photosystem I react with pesticide ions leading
to free radicals that are rapidly converted by oxygen into superoxides.
These highly reactive superoxides attack unsaturated fatty acids of
the membranes, causing a rapid disintegration of cells and tissues,6−8 that result in loss of water and rapid drying.

According to
the PPDB (pesticide properties database),5 the DQ has an oral lethal dose (LD50) of 214 mg/kg, approximately
twice that of the PQ: 110 mg/kg.5,9 In terms of their fate
in the environment, both have low volatility and low leachability
and high potential to bind to particles. For DQ, its DT50 factor (soil degradation in aerobic conditions) is 2345 days and
it exhibits moderately fast aqueous photolysis (DT50 =
7 days) at pH = 7, but is stable to aqueous hydrolysis.10 On the basis of these data, quats can be considered
very persistent compounds in the environment and difficult to eliminate.
At the time of writing of this manuscript, the legal status of quats
in the European Union is diverse. DQ, mepiquat and chlormequat are
currently authorized substances, whereas, for example, PQ is excluded
as an active substance and absent in the list of active substances
of plant protection products (EC 1107/2009). Although PQ has been
banned others are not, and because of their persistence at rather
high levels in the environment coupled to their moderate to high toxicity
for humans, birds, algae and aquatic invertebrates,9 it seems necessary to explore new elimination methods.
Because of its toxicity, persistence, and approval for agricultural
purposes and it being one of the most used pesticides in its family,
DQ is going to be used as a model quat pesticide in this study.

The actual problem in this endeavor is not usually the actual degradation
of organic pollutants, as procedures abound for this task, but how
to agglutinate the remains of pesticides dispersed through different
and extended matrices to perform the elimination. Currently, methods
based on the use of supramolecular chemistry are becoming increasingly
important in agriculture, not only for the elimination of contaminants
but also for the controlled release of certain phytosanitary substances.11−15 Some of the systems that can be used for the capture of organic
molecules are metal organic frameworks,16,17 calixarenes,18,19 cucurbiturils,20,21 bambusurils,22 cyclodextrins,11,14 and covalent organic
frameworks23 among others.

As a capturing
device in this in silico study, we propose the use of nanohoops ([n]-cycloparaphenylenes) because of their binding capacity,
their useful spectroscopic properties, and their accessibility, due
to the recent development of different methods for their synthesis.

[n]-cycloparaphenylenes ([n]-CPPs)
were termed in 2008 as carbon nanohoops by Jasti and Bertozzi after
the first synthesis was accomplished.24 In solid state, nanohoops form a rigid three-dimensional architecture
with long-range channels25−28 stabilized by multiple π–π contacts.29,30 The closed ring structure provides the [n]-CPPs
with several advantageous properties in relation to their linear counterparts,
such as a narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap,31 and diameter-dependent fluorescence,29,32,33 electrochemical,34,35 and optoelectronic properties32,36−38 that can be exploited in sensing applications.

Nanohoops possess
a unique, rigid, full sp2-hybridized conjugated core with
a radially oriented π system31 which
provides a hydrophobic electron-rich cavity that can act as a strong
host for electron-deficient guests.39−42 CPP size can be tuned spanning
a range suitable for encapsulating small molecules such as CO243 or species as large as fullerenes
(C60, C70, C82...).39−42,44−46 The encapsulating
properties of these systems however are still to be rigorously studied.
The present work opens the door to complexations and even selective
separations that can be optimized by changing the nature of the nanoring
through chemical modification, thus creating fine-tuned donor–acceptor
nanohoop structures.

A recent effort to characterize the sensing
capability of CPPs to detect ammonium species was carried out by Gaeta
and coworkers.47 In this work, a systematic
experimental study on the complexation ability of [8]-CPP and various
pyridinium ions was performed. [8]-CPP was found to act as an excellent
host for smaller pyridinium ions but it fails when PQ is tested. Gaeta
hypothesizes that the larger size of PQ could be responsible for [8]-CPP
failing to host this pesticide. These recent results are however promising
and led us to undertake a thorough study on the potential of these
macrocyclic structures to sense and capture quats. Because PQ has
been banned from agricultural use in the European Union we focused
our attention on DQ, a pesticide that is currently in use and has
similar structure and effects, but features a smaller molecular size.

With this work, we intend to answer, among other, the following
questions:Is it possible to
complex big pyridinium cations inside a nanohoop? If possible, how
stable are these complexes?

What size
of ring is necessary to maximize the stabilizing host–guest
interactions?

Can nanohoops act as sensing-devices
for the efficient detection of quats?

Can vibrational spectroscopy be used as a detection tool? If possible,
what is the most promising technique?



2 Computational Methods
Density functional theory (DFT)
in the Kohn–Sham formulation as implemented in Gaussian 0948 was used to locate minimum structures on the
potential energy surfaces of the complexes under study. All calculations
were performed with the hybrid-meta GGA functional M06-2X in combination
with the Def2SVP Ahlrich’s split-valence quality basis. The
M06-2X functional was selected because of its recognized good performance
in the study of hydrogen bonds, H−π, π–π
and electrostatic interactions both in neutral and charged dimeric
systems.49,50 To achieve results with high accuracy, tight
self-consistent field criteria and a fine-pruned grid for the numerical
integration were used (the latter containing 99 radial points and
590 angular points per shell). Harmonic analysis of the second derivatives
of the energy with respect to the nuclear displacements was also computed
for each stationary point to ensure that a minimum structure and not
a transition state or higher order saddle point was located.

Before any molecular structure can be used as a sensor, an initial
step of association is needed. Solvation effects however can play
an important role in this association step. In general, liberation
of solvent molecules inside the cavity of the host dominates the host–guest
complex formation because of entropic effects. Owing to the constant
size of the DQ guest studied in this work, the same number of solvent
molecules is expected to be expelled from the cavity of the host,
irrespectively of the size of the cavity. For this reason, the gas
phase process is described in this work, because the main interest
of this study is the accurate description of the host–guest
interactions, key to molecular recognition and sensing. Nevertheless,
other energy terms can disfavor the complexation process when it occurs
in solvent phase, which should be taken into account. Fortunately,
binding energies in solution can be estimated efficiently via a continuum
solvation approach, such as PCM.51−53 Interaction host–guest
energies have therefore been computed in various solvents of increasing
polarity (see the Supporting Information). In all cases, the host–guest complex formation is favorable.
Also, the entry of DQ in the cavity of the nanohoops may be kinetically
penalized. We have estimated the barrier for such process through
a rigid scan (see Supporting Information) to be about 10 kJ/mol, a low value for a process that is expected
to occur at room temperature.

Interaction energies for the complexes
under study were computed by means of the supermolecule method using
the counterpoise procedure to avoid basis set superposition errors.
Interaction energies for the case of two interacting molecules can
be written as 1  with terms in parentheses indicating the basis set, subscripts the
system under consideration and superscripts the structure of the unit
employed in the calculation. As the geometry of the molecules change
when the complex is formed, an additional contribution to the energy
describing this effect (deformation energy) must be included. It is
obtained as the difference in energy between the molecules in the
cluster geometry and isolated 2  

Finally, the complexation energy of the system can be written
as a combination of both terms: interaction and deformation energy. 3  

Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT)54,55 can be used to make a decomposition of the previous interaction
energy into physically meaningful components such as electrostatic,
exchange, induction, and dispersion. In SAPT, the total Hamiltonian
of the system is written as 4  where F̂A and F̂B are the monomer
Fock operators and ŴA and ŴB are the Møller–Plesset
fluctuation operators for fragments A and B, respectively. V̂ consists of the intermolecular Coulomb operator
and can be written as follows 5  where V0 is the nuclear interaction energy between the two fragments
and ν̂A(j) describes the interaction
of electron j ∈ B with nucleus I ∈A (ν̂B(i) has an
equivalent meaning). The SAPT approach is based on the Rayleigh–Schrødinger
perturbation expansion with respect to perturbation parameters ξ,
ζ, and η. The resulting interaction energy can be expressed
as 6  where i indicates the order in perturbation theory
with respect to the intermolecular potential and j indicates the order with respect to the intramolecular electron
correlation. Usually, attractive terms (electrostatic, induction,
and dispersion) are originated from the polarization expansion while
repulsive terms arise from the use of a global antisymmetrizer to
force the correct permutational symmetry of the dimer wavefunction.

The SAPT series can be truncated according to the desired accuracy.
The simplest SAPT method is called SAPT0, an approach that truncates
the expansion series in second order. This method essentially treats
the monomers at the HF level (intramolecular electron correlation
is neglected) and dispersion terms arise from second-order perturbation
theory. The different terms of the SAPT0 energy equation are grouped
according to their nature (electrostatic, repulsion, induction, and
dispersion) following the proposal of Parker et al.55 using a color code. The blue represents electrostatic terms,
red shows the repulsive component, inductive terms are written in
green, and in pink the dispersive contributions. The global SAPT0
energy is given by the equation: 7  

In this equation,
the superscripts v,w in the terms Evw define the order in V̂ and in ŴA + ŴB, respectively, and the subscripts “r” indicate that the response correction for induction
is incorporated by solving coupled-perturbed HF equations.56,57 The Hartree–Fock correction δEHF(2) represents polarization beyond the second
order Eind20 and is defined
as 8  where ΔEint,supermoleculeHF is the interaction energy at the HF level computed following the
supermolecule approach.

To deepen in the study of the DQ complexation
with nanohoops, the interaction energy of the DQ-[n]-CPP complex has been fragmented according to different chemical
groups using F-ISAPT0.58−61 Within this methodology, it is possible to analyze the contribution
to the global interaction energy coming from each defined fragment.
All calculations related to the SAPT methodology have been carried
out with the PSI4 software,62 benefiting
from the density-fitting approach. This procedure introduces negligible
errors into the SAPT energy and greatly improves efficiency. In all
cases, the basis set jun-cc-pVDZ63 as recommended
by Sherril has been used with the corresponding auxiliary basis (jun-cc-pVDZ-ri
and jun-cc-pVDZ-jkfit) to make use of the density-fitting approach.
Jun-cc-pVDZ basis set is created removing diffuse functions (diffuse
from H and He and also the highest angular momentum diffuse function
from the rest of the atoms) from the well-known Dunning’s correlation
consistent basis set: aug-cc-pVDZ.64 Once
the F-ISAPT computation is done, the SAPT0 analysis shown along the
results section is obtained as a sum of all the chemical group contributions.

In order to gather a deeper insight into the type of interactions
present in the complexes under study, a noncovalent interaction analysis
is performed using for this purpose the Multiwfn program.65 The noncovalent interaction index (NCI) identifies
interactions in a chemical system based solely on the electron density
and its derivatives.66 This method is based
on the peaks that appear in the reduced density gradient (RDG) at
low densities enabling the identification of favorable and unfavorable
noncovalent interactions. 9  

To discriminate the type of
interactions, low-density and low-gradient regions cannot be used
alone,66 and for this reason the sign of
the second Hessian eigenvalue (λ2) times the electron
density (ρ) is used to distinguish bonded from nonbonded interactions
and also to yield a measure of their relative strength. A BGR color
scale where blue indicates strongly attractive interactions, green
weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and red strongly repulsive
interactions is used to map out the sign λ2ρ
product onto the 0.4 a.u. RDG isosurface. A RDG versus the sign(λ2)ρ scatter graph is also computed as a complementary
way to visualize and confirm the type of interactions and their intensity
as a function of the chosen isosurface.

To analyze the possibility
that these supramolecular complexes can be also used as sensing devices,
resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy is proposed as a detection tool.
To simulate Raman pre-resonance conditions, first the UV–vis
spectrum is computed using time-dependent DFT considering 50 different
excited states. Those transitions from the ground state that have
the larger oscillator strengths are usually chosen as incident frequencies;
nevertheless, the calculation of the frequency-dependent polarizabilities
can diverge at exact resonance conditions. There are two main ways
to solve the divergence problem: the use of a small detuning of the
excitation frequency67,68 or the incorporation of a damping
parameter into the frequency-dependent polarizability expression.69 In this work, we have performed a detailed analysis
of the effect of the excitation wavelength on the Raman activity spectra
of the optimal DQ–CPP complex computing its 3D RR spectrum.
Exact resonance conditions were avoided in all cases, so no damping
parameter was used for the calculation. The frequency-dependent polarizabilities
and subsequently the Raman activities were calculated using the coupled
perturbed DFT theory as implemented in the Gaussian09 software package,
and the final spectrum was represented using a Lorentzian band shape
with a half-width at half height of 4 cm–1.

3 Results and Discussion
In a first step, host–guest
complexes between DQ and different size CPPs were obtained. To account
for the conformational flexibility of DQ inside the CPP macromolecule,
different orientations were considered for the guest and subjected
to unconstrained geometry optimizations. The resulting structures
were screened according to their relative energy, selecting the most
stable complex for each size of CPP to carry out the subsequent analysis
(Figure 1).

Figure 1 Minimum energy
CPP@DQ configurations are shown for systems with increasing CPP ring-sizes,
ranging between 7 and 12 benzene rings (A–F). Subfigure (G)
illustrates the geometric parameters considered for the characterization
of the cavity inside the nanohoop. The elliptical parameters a and b for each of these structures are
collected in Table 1.

Once the structures of the systems
were obtained the interaction, complexation and deformation energies
have been calculated as described in the Computational
Methods section.

As shown in Table 1, complexation energies vary between −190 and −258
kJ/mol, approximately. If the complexation energy is analyzed as a
function of size, a clear minimum appears: the nanohoop formed by
9 benzene rings ([9]-CPP) with a complexation energy of −257.61
kJ/mol is the most stable one. The second largest complexation energy
is found for [10]-CPP (Eint = −228.53
kJ/mol) followed by [8]-CPP (Eint = −223.17
kJ/mol). These results reveal that there is a very favorable interaction
between DQ and the nanoring structure for the entire series of nanohoops,
even if the formation of each of these complexes involves an energy
penalty due to the deformation of the interacting species with respect
to their isolated geometry. As it can be seen in Table 1, these deformation energies
range between 9.16 kJ/mol for [10]-CPP and 32.64 kJ/mol for [8]-CPP
and are dominated by the deformation of the CPP moiety. In all cases,
the geometrical changes of the nanohoop upon complexation contribute
more than 84% of the total deformation energy and deformation energies
of DQ only account for 0.71–3.31 kJ/mol.

a Interaction, complexation,
and deformation energies (in kJ/mol) are shown in the first three
entries of the table. The total deformation energy is dissected in
[n]-CPP and DQ contributions. Initial nanohoop size
shows its diameter when isolated (in Å, circular cavity). Finally,
elliptical parameters a and b (Å)
correspond to the major and minor axis of the CPP cavity when complexed
with DQ. Flattening parameter (f) measures the compression
of the ellipse and it is defined as f = (a – b)/a.

Without taking into account the
deformation energy necessary to form the supramolecular system, the
interaction energies range between −202 and −284 kJ/mol.
The trend is the same found for complexation energies, although DQ@[8]-CPP
has a larger interaction energy than DQ@[10]-CPP. The increased interaction
due to the closer contact favored by the smaller ring-size in the
former is compensated by the highest deformation energy for both the
nanohoop and DQ, leading to a less favorable complexation. Thus, the
interplay between interaction and deformation energies is key in determining
the most stable DQ@[n]-CPP complexes, and deformation
of the nanohoop is the largest contributor. Isolated nanohoops feature
mostly cylindrical cavities; however, when complexed with DQ, the
nanoring adopts an ellipse-like shape. The [9]-CPP system, when forming
a complex with DQ, increases its size by 1.48 Å in one axis and
decreases it by 1.22 Å in the other (a percentage variation of
+9.8 and −12.1%, respectively, with respect to empty [9]-CPP),
which is reflected in the second greatest deformation energy. However,
this deformation is invested in a better degree of adjustment of the
guest into the cavity, enhancing the vdW interactions so that DQ@[9]-CPP
has the largest interaction and complexation energies in the series.
Actually, [9]-CPP is the smallest system in which DQ fits sideways
inside, that is, establishing C–H−π contacts with
the nanoring (this is associated with a high flattening parameter f of 0.20).

In the case of [7]-CPP and [8]-CPP, the
cavity is too small to allow a flat layout of the guest molecule,
which is then forced to adopt a perpendicular arrangement to the ring,
establishing in this case stacking-type interactions (see Figure 1). This spatial arrangement
explains why in [8]-CPP, axial deformations of just 0.35 and 0.74
Å are observed. Among the systems under study, the relatively
large structural variations found in [12]-CPP (1.31 and −1.12
Å, in each of the axes) are especially interesting because this
nanohoop is big enough to host two guest molecules (see Figure 1). The average percentage change
is around 7.40% but the energy penalty associated to this deformation
is only 13.56 kJ/mol. This fact can be attributed to the larger flexibility
of the macromolecule, which allows it to maximize the host–guest
interactions at a reduced cost. Hence, the relatively high flattening
parameter (f = 0.14). It is worth noticing that the
interaction energies are lower in larger rings as many short-range
interactions between the guest and the host are lost. The spatial
arrangement of DQ inside [12]-CPP precludes stabilizing contacts that
could be established between half of the DQ molecule and cycloparaphenylene.
The great difference between the capturing efficiency of the 9- and
10-membered nanorings can be attributed to the loss of these stabilizing
short range intermolecular interactions. Because weak vdW interactions
are highly dependent on distance, a larger void space in the [10]-CPP
cavity causes loss of effectiveness in host–guest interactions.

Weak stabilizing interactions in host–guest complexes can
be visualized by analyzing noncovalent interactions as shown in Figure 2. In this figure,
RDG values versus the electron density multiplied by the sign of the
second eigenvalue of the hessian are displayed. This produces a scatter
plot where the falling tails represent noncovalent interactions, and
their color code provides the kind of interaction (repulsive, weakly
attractive or strongly attractive, the last one usually associated
to hydrogen bonds). The abundance of points forming a tail in the
region around zero (represented in green) highlights the existence
of numerous weak interactions. The points in red correspond to steric
repulsive interactions. These are located at the geometric center
of each benzene ring of the nanohoop, they are intramolecular steric
contacts and therefore do not affect the interactions with the guest
molecule. In fact, we found no steric contacts between host and guest,
as they are avoided due to the almost free rotation ability of the
benzene fragments. Actually, it is often observed in these nanohoops
that the benzene rings adopt an alternating conformation (each benzene
moiety is slightly inclined with respect to the neighboring rings)
minimizing in this way destabilizing contacts. In order to illustrate
the spatial region in which noncovalent interactions appear, an isosurface
of 0.4 a.u. value is chosen to plot the RDG. Interestingly, this three
dimensional representation produces a clear interaction belt between DQ and the CPP host (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 (A) Scatter graph of the RDG vs the sign of the second
eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix multiplied by the electron density.
(B) Spatial visualization of noncovalent interactions in the [9]-CPP
system using a 0.4 a.u. isosurface. A color scale (in a.u.) is used
to differentiate strong (blue) from weak attractive interactions (green)
and from repulsive ones (red). Intramolecular repulsive noncovalent
interactions at the center of the benzene rings have been removed
for clarity.

When performing this
kind of analysis for all the DQ@CPP complexes, the effect of the empty
space in the cavity can be clearly observed: the larger the empty
space, the lower the density of noncovalent interactions. However,
if the cavity is too tight (as in [7] and [8]-CPP), some repulsive
interactions start to arise. In Figure 3, a color scale between −0.030 a.u. (dark blue)
and +0.025 a.u. (red) has been chosen in order to represent NCI interactions
in the DQ@CPP complexes, so that interaction regions of stabilizing
and destabilizing nature can be differentiated. In the case of [7]-CPP,
the large size of the isosurface indicates the existence of numerous
interactions; however, the green tone of most of them indicates their
weak (both stabilizing and destabilizing) character. Close contacts
between C–H groups and the center of the benzene ring are established
and repulsive interaction domains appear in these regions, even if
their magnitude is not high. [8]-CPP also displays an extended RDG
surface but the weak interaction regions (green) are less dominant
and are replaced by stronger and attractive interaction regions (blue),
as is also reflected in the interaction energy values collected in Table 1. Larger rings ([10]
to [12]-CPP) show less effective interacting isosurfaces as the cavity
is too big for DQ. [9]-CPP is a sweet spot where the fit with DQ is
close enough to maximize the interacting surface but the cavity is
also spacious enough to avoid repulsive steric contacts as shown on Figure 3. Actually, the presence
of several blue domains in the interacting belt of [9]-CPP highlights
medium-to-high energy stabilizing contacts (some repulsive CH-benzene
ring contacts are still present as well).

Figure 3 Spatial regions where
noncovalent interactions occur in [7] to [12]-CPP systems as revealed
by the NCI method (0.4 a.u. isosurface). The color scale is the same
shown in subfigure B at Figure 2.

In view of these reduced gradient
isosurfaces and the energies collected in Table 1, it seems reasonable to propose [9]-CPP
as the best structure for capturing DQ because of the existence of
the right balance between the deformation necessary to obtain a complex
with close stabilizing contacts and the resulting favorable interactions.

As has been explained in the Computational Methods section, SAPT allows us to dissect the interaction energy as a combination
of four terms with clear physical meaning: electrostatic, exchange,
induction, and dispersion energies. In this work, we use the SAPT0
a truncation of the perturbation to second order based on HF wavefunctions.
Recently, a powerful methodology has been developed to further decompose
these four energy terms into molecular fragment contributions. This
is especially interesting to understand how each chemical group contributes
to the global interaction energy and can be the basis of a campaign
of rational design of hosts. Therefore, the four terms in which the
interaction energy is decomposed, have also been dissected according
to different molecular fragments with the reduced F-ISAPT0 method.58−61 In this method, we have assumed that when cleaving a covalent bond
to define the chemical groups its contribution is split 50:50 to each
fragment. DQ is considered always as a single entity, while the [n]-CPP moiety is fragmented into phenylene groups.

Results from the SAPT0 dissection of the interaction energy between
the DQ and the different [n]-CPP considered are summarized
in Table 2. All complexes
are dominated by stabilizing components (electrostatic, induction,
and dispersion), among which the electrostatic contribution is quite
high (around 30%) because we are dealing with charged systems. Induction
terms are also significant (around 30% as well). The overall induction
term can be decomposed in two parts: the induction of CPP due to the
presence of DQ and vice versa. The global induction value is clearly
dominated by the IndDQ→CPP term because of the polarizing
ability of the cationic pesticide inside the nanohoop.

a All energies are
given in kJ/mol.

The dispersion
contribution shows an interesting trend when considering the ring
size. For tight cavities, where NCI analysis displayed
a full interaction belt, the dispersion energy is
strongly stabilizing (around −200 kJ/mol), whereas systems
with broad cavities and looser bonding feature less stabilizing dispersive
interactions (around −130 kJ/mol). There is therefore a clear
energy gap between the values found for CPP[7]-CPP[9] and those corresponding
to larger nanorings. These larger values in smaller rings are due
to the numerous stacking and CH−π interactions present
in these complexes. The exchange energy term follows a trend similar
to dispersion because both depend on the number of C–C, C–N
and C–H contacts at short distances.

According to all
the contributions shown in Table 2, [9]-CPP benefits from a relatively low exchange +
dispersion penalty when compared to other systems with tight and strongly interacting cavities and very favorable electrostatic
and induction terms. [7]-CPP and [8]-CPP show slightly more favorable
dispersion interactions, but at the cost of poorer induction or electrostatic
stabilization. Moreover, [8]-CPP pays a fortune in terms of exchange
repulsion which cannot be compensated by the slightly better vdW interactions.

As mentioned above, perhaps the most interesting part of the decomposition
of interaction energies is to be able to attribute a certain amount
of each of the energetic components to the different molecular groups
of the systems studied. A detailed analysis on the nanoring fragment
contributions to these energy terms is illustrated in Figure 4. We have performed this analysis
for three representative complexes: the most stable ([9]-CPP), the
smallest ([7]-CPP), and one of the largest rings ([11]-CPP), all of
them with an odd number of benzene moieties in the nanohoop.

Figure 4 Different contributions
to the interaction energy decomposed using the F-ISAPT methodology
for selected systems. The supramolecular complex is divided into the
DQ moiety and each of the benzene rings of the nanohoop as fragments.
A color scale ranging from −42.0 kJ/mol (blue) to 42.0 kJ/mol
(red) is used to help visualize the interactions of each fragment.

For the most stable one ([9]-CPP),
a dark blue tone (values of −26.4 and −22.12 kJ/mol)
is observed in the electrostatic component in the two rings closest
to the nitrogen atoms of the DQ moiety, it corresponds to the strong
electrostatic cation−π interactions between the most
positively charged region of DQ and the two closest benzene rings
of the CPP. There are also two other phenylene fragments that display
a very significant contribution to the global electrostatics of the
system (−25.9 and −23.4 kJ/mol respectively). These
interactions are due to the C–H−π contacts with
the hydrogen atoms in para position with respect to the N atoms in
DQ. Both the N atoms and the C–H groups in para feature significant
positive partial charge, hence the high electrostatic component. However,
this also produces geometric proximity with the phenylene fragments
of the nanoring and, as a consequence, exchange repulsion. Interestingly,
the attractive electrostatic component and the exchange repulsion
almost cancel out for both kinds of fragments (N atoms and the C–H
in para), which implies that the eventual complex stability can be
diagnosed in terms of induction and dispersion terms only. The IndDQ→CPP induction and dispersion terms display a more
homogeneous character. They are stabilizing all along the perimeter
of [9]-CPP in about −19 and −23 kJ/mol per phenylene
fragment for induction and dispersion, respectively, but the two rings
interacting with the N atoms show significantly higher values (−22.6
and −25.2 kJ/mol). In the case of induction, these larger values
can be assigned again to the localized charge on the N atoms, which
exert a strong polarizing effect.

In the larger system (11-[CPP]),
there is a large unused volume of the cavity so, to maximize the DQ–CPP
interactions, the guest is displaced to one side of the nanohoop,
deforming the ring in that direction. This effect can be easily appreciated
using the F-ISAPT0 analysis. The electrostatic component is clearly
more favorable in the rings having direct interaction with the DQ
and practically negligible in the most remote phenylene moieties.
In the [11]-CPP complex, there are two cases where the benzene rings
have a positive (repulsive) electrostatic component. The benzene moiety
marked in light brown in the electrostatic component destabilizes
the global system by 23.90 kJ/mol, a large contribution that can hardly
be compensated with other favorable contributions. Actually, that
phenylene fragment alone displays a global contribution of +12.79
kJ/mol, that is, it destabilizes the complex. Four phenylene rings
further away in DQ, we find another ring with a positive electrostatic
component but much less intense (1.10 kJ/mol). In this ring, the stabilizing
energy components are also small thus making for an almost irrelevant
global contribution to the complexation energy of this fragment (−1.68
kJ/mol). The major contributions of DQ → CPP induction and
highly stabilizing dispersion components occur in the rings closest
to DQ. Unlike [9]-CPP in which the contributions of the electrostatics
and the exchange were almost compensated, in this case, the sum of
both yields stabilizing results due to the greater magnitude of the
electrostatics.

In [7]-CPP, a slightly different situation can
be found as the small size of the cavity causes the DQ guest to adopt
a different orientation, perpendicular to the nanohoop with the strongly
positive zones associated to the N atoms poised very close to some
phenylene rings. It is worth mentioning that DQ is slightly displaced
from the center of the nanohoop toward one of the sides of the cavity.
This fact and the conformation of the phenylene fragments results,
despite the high degree of confinement of the guest inside of the
cavity, in a differentiated behavior between fragments. As shown in Figure 4, even with such
a tight cavity, one phenylene unit hardly contributes to the electrostatics
of the exchange energies (in bright green color). However, the non-negligible
induction and dispersion terms entail that the contribution of this
ring to the global interaction energy is about 10% of the total stability.
The greatest electrostatic interaction occurs between the positive
region of DQ (including here the N atoms and aliphatic bridge that
joins them) with the closest benzene rings. These phenylene fragments
are therefore the ones that contribute the most to global energy (19.0
and 16.4% respectively). These two significant contributions are reinforced
by having the greatest dispersion contributions. The DQ → CPP
induction term is in this case quite similar in all fragments, with
an average value of −18.75 kJ/mol. As in all the analyzed systems,
the reverse CPP → DQ induction does not play any relevant role
for the global energy (it contributes only 1% to the global of [7]-CPP,
0.4% in [9]-CPP and 0.43% in the [11]-CPP system).

3.1 Exploring
the Sensing Ability of [9]-CPP System: RR Spectroscopy
Prior
to capturing the pesticide, its detection in complex matrices like
plants or substrate is needed. The high binding energies to [n]-CPPs found for DQ make attractive the possibility of
using these complexes as sensing devices. In order to explore this
potential, we performed simulations of Raman spectra. The reasoning
behind this choice of technique are the advantages that vibrational
spectroscopy provides for the study of nanohoops and the fact that
the pesticide is a good chromophore. Making use of Raman spectroscopy,
Chen et al. have already determined that [n]-CPPs
possess characteristic vibrations that converge with those exhibited
by long polyparaphenylenes as their size increases.70,71 These size-dependent Raman modes were studied experimentally and
confirmed by means of quantum chemical calculations. We propose the
use of RR spectroscopy because it leads to larger intensities and
likely better detection limits than other vibrational spectroscopies.
As far as we know, although Raman and vibrational resonance techniques
are widely used in nanotubes due to their nondestructive nature and
the ability to probe both elastic and electronic structures,72−78 until now RR spectroscopy has never been applied to [n]-CPPs.

Prior to the computation of the RR spectra, we simulated
the UV–vis absorption ones, which helped us choose the transitions
with larger oscillator strengths. The electronic absorption spectrum
of the DQ@[9]-CPP system (Figure 5) spans 200 nm between 225 and 425 nm forming a wide
band with a maximum at 316 nm and a shoulder located at around 265
nm. As it can be seen in Figure 5, at the maximum of the band three transitions contribute
significantly. The one shown in green has the maximum placed at νmax = 312.4 nm with an oscillator strength of 1.170 (with a
global contribution of 31.1%). The maximum of the one shown in red
is placed at 324.7 nm (f = 0.278, contribution 10.6%),
while the one marked in blue is about 3 nm away from the previous
one, νmax = 327.9 nm (f = 0.862,
contribution 46.9%). These are complex transitions which are composed
of several transits between molecular orbitals, as indicated in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Main electronic transitions
that contribute to the maximum in the UV–vis spectrum of DQ@[9]-CPP.
Each of these transitions (colored in green, red, and blue) are composed
of various transits between orbitals (orbital energy is given in eV).
The percentage values show the contribution of each transit to the
global band. The remaining amount up to 100% comes from various transits
with minor weights. For each of the marked bands, the position of
the maximum (in nm) and the oscillator strength associated with the
electronic transition is provided. The molecular orbitals are represented
with a 0.02 isovalue displaying positive values in red and negative
in blue.

RR usually provides optimum response
near the UV–vis absorption maxima, but there is no rule of
thumb to decide in which direction and what step size to walk away
from the exact maximum. Additionally, the UV–vis simulations
of the complex produced an absorption band bracketed between 225 and
425 nm (see Figure 5) but the UV–vis spectrum of isolated DQ ranges between 100
and 350 nm (see Supporting Information).
We have therefore carried out a systematic study to calculate the
RR spectra employing incident wavelengths in 100–350 nm range
of the UV spectrum by sampling every 2 nm, hence including the complex
maximum and the isolated pesticide signal. The global composition
of the individual spectra generates the three-dimensional amplified
spectrum shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Three-dimensional RR spectrum showing the Raman intensity (a.u.)
of each of the vibrational modes in the range between 0 and 3500 cm–1 as a function of the laser incident wavelength (in
nm). To facilitate the visualization a color scale between violet
(low intensity) and red (high intensity) has been used.

To select the optimum wavelengths from the 3D RR
spectrum shown in Figure 6 to be used as incident lights, a double criterion must be
used: one based on the signal/noise ratio and the other one based
on selecting vibrations that allow a selective identification of the
guest molecule. In the first place, in terms of the signal-to-noise
ratio, it is important that the vibrations appear well defined in
the spectrum, with not many contiguous bands, in order to facilitate
identification. Secondly, to carry out a selective identification,
it is convenient that the chosen vibrations are characteristic of
the particular molecule under study, in this case DQ. For this purpose,
through the visualization of the vibrational modes and their comparison
with the vibrations of isolated DQ, 10 characteristic vibrations with
potential to be used as diagnostic signals have been selected (see Table 3). These vibrations
include stretching (ν) of the CH groups that join both pyridine
rings of the DQ moiety located at 3190.2 and 3193.6 cm–1, stretching (ν) of the rings of the DQ (1665.9 cm–1), CH2 wagging (ω) (1259.4 cm–1), out-of-plane deformation (γ) of DQ rings (743.5 cm–1), in-plane bending (δ), and out-of-plane bending (γ)
of the CH groups (1442.2 and 943.6 cm–1 respectively)
as well as other combined vibrational modes at 1530.1, 1319.0, and
1098.7 cm–1. In all cases, the vibrational modes
of DQ complexed inside of [9]-CPP experience displacements with respect
to isolated DQ between 0.5 and 13.87 cm–1, which
allows us to discern if the DQ is inside of [9]-CPP or not. Only two
of these modes (1319.0 and 1442.2 cm–1) are slightly
coupled with vibrations of the cycloparaphenylene structure.

a The frequency
of all the vibrations is given in cm–1. The static
limit shows the intensity of the conventional Raman spectrum in which
no incident light wavelength has been used. Amplified Raman intensities
(in arbitrary units) are given for incident light frequency 272, 322,
and 326 nm. Parentheses show the enhancement factor, defined as the
logarithm of the quotient between the amplified intensity and the
corresponding intensity of the static limit. The location of the corresponding
isolated DQ vibrations mode is also given. Finally, the assignment
of the selected vibrational modes is shown where ν corresponds
to stretching modes, δ with in-plane bending vibrations, γ
are out-of-plane vibrations, and ω refers to wagging molecular
displacements. Note that no scaling factors were used for these frequencies.

According to the selection
criteria mentioned above, three wavelengths have been chosen as candidates
for sensing purposes: 272, 322, and 326 nm. Interestingly, they correspond
with slight displacements (around 2–3 nm) from relevant points
in the UV–vis spectrum previously computed. The 272 nm value
is close to the electronic transitions that give rise to the shoulder
in this spectrum, while the other two are placed close to the absorption
maximum. Figure 7 shows
the amplified and indexed Raman spectra for the three selected incident
wavelengths as well as their first derivative. The use of derived
spectroscopy facilitates the study of bands that are mixed (overlapped)
or very close to each other, hence helping distinguish isolated from
complexed DQ scenarios. It should be mentioned that due to the orbitals
that participate in each of the transitions, not all the vibrations
are amplified when using incident light of the selected wavelengths.
In Table 3, the enhancement
factor for each of the vibrational modes has been included in parentheses,
a parameter that accounts for the magnitude of the amplification with
respect to the value of Raman intensity in the static limit. Although
some of the bands indicated in the spectrum may seem of very low intensity,
they are perfectly valid for sensing applications with nanohoops because
the Raman intensity is multiplied by a factor of 106 in
the RR spectra and 105 in the first derivative resonant
Raman spectroscopy. On the basis of the data shown, any of the incident
wavelengths selected would be a good candidate for a sensing study;
however, 322 nm can be regarded as the most promising one because
of the number of amplified vibrational modes and high enhancement
factors.

Figure 7 Raman intensity spectra for the DQ-[9]-CPP system considering three
different incident laser wavelengths (272, 322, and 326 nm) are shown
on the left. The corresponding derivative RR spectra are represented
on the right. Incident wavelengths represented are 272 nm (top), 322
nm (middle), and 326 nm (bottom). Raman intensities for the original
spectra are shown scaled with a factor of 106, while their
first derivatives are scaled by 105. Indexes correspond
to Table 3.

4 Conclusions
Novel [n]-CPP architectures
can be used for the capture of the DQ pesticide. A size-dependent
complexation study was done showing that [9]-CPP is the most suitable
nanohoop for complexation of this molecule.

Complexation energies as high as −257.6 kJ/mol are obtained
for the optimum size system, although there is an energy penalty (between
9.2 and 32.6 kJ/mol) to overcome because of the deformation of fragments
with respect to their isolated geometries.

To maximize interactions with the DQ pesticide in bigger cycloparaphenylenes,
the molecule is displaced to one side and highly deforms the ring.
Because of the high flexibility of the hoop, there is not a big energy
penalty associated to this process. However, lower interaction energies
are obtained because of the existence of a large void space that does
not allow short-range interactions to stabilize half of the guest.

Complexes are dispersion dominated and also
have high DQ→CPP induction contributions. In the optimum [9]-CPP,
each energy contribution to the total interaction energy is well balanced
between all the rings, while in bigger ones there are clear local
high contributions where the DQ is placed and almost negligible in
the most remote ones.

The use of RR spectroscopy
allows us to perform DQ sensing by rational selection of the incident
laser wavelengths. 322 nm was shown to be the best option for the
study of the DQ-[9]-CPP system because of the good signal-to-noise
ratio and the number of vibrational modes that allow selective identification.

Significant vibrations of DQ show a displacement
with respect to isolated gas phase calculations, which allows us to
discern if the complexation was achieved or not. The use of first
derivative spectroscopy makes it easier to identify the position of
characteristic vibrations, especially in cases where they are close
to other bands.



These results suggest
that CPPs could be a promising approach for DQ encapsulation and sensing,
allowing the formation of remarkably stable complexes and providing
a set of characteristic vibrations which could be used as DQ tracers.
