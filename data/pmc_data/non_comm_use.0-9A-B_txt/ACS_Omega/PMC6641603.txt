of a privilege imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine scaffold from
2-chloro-3-nitropyridine in combination with environmentally benign
H2O-IPA as a green solvent is presented. The scope of the
novel method has been demonstrated through the tandem sequence of
SNAr reaction with substituted primary amines followed
by the in situ nitro group reduction and subsequent heteroannulation
with substituted aromatic aldehydes to obtain functionalized imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines with only one chromatographic purification step.
The synthesis pathway appears to be green, simple, and superior compared
with other already reported procedures, with the high abundance of
reagents and great ability in expanding the structural diversity.

Introduction
Highly diverse polyheterocyclic
ring systems have played a crucial
role in medicinal chemistry, which may facilitate the discovery of
novel biologically active molecules.1 These
heterocyclic small molecules modulate the functions of receptors or
enzymes in living systems, which is very important for studying biology
and their treatment of disease.2 Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines are an important class of heterocycles which
have gained much attention in recent years owing to the broad spectrum
of their bioactivities.3 Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines were reported as dual inhibitors of FLT3/aurora
kinases for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (A) as well as a potent angiotensin II type I receptor blocker (B) with partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
agonism.4 Similarly, 2-phenyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-3-acetamide (C) has been reported as nonbenzodiazepine anticonvulsants
and anxiolytics, whereas an imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-based
drug, sulmazole (D), acts as a cardiotonic agent (Figure 1).5

Figure 1 Biologically active imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives.

Besides this, imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives
also possess the potential for numerous applications of proton- and
charge-transfer processes in organometallic chemistry and in material
science owing to their special structural characteristics.6 In recent years, some novel synthesis strategies
have been reported for the synthesis of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives via N–C–N or N–C–N–C
bond formation reaction. The first method for imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives via the N–C–N bond
formation involves the reaction of diamines with aldehydes or excess
of carboxylic acids in the presence of FeCl3 or aerial
oxidation under heating.7 Recently, Pitchumani
and co-workers have published the use of a recyclable Al3+-exchanged K10 clay as solid acids catalyzed synthesis of 2-substituted
3-ethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines.8 The second method involves the N–C–N–C
bond formation, which occurs via Pd- or Cu-catalyzed regiospecific
cyclization of 2-halo-3-acylaminopyridines with amines, Pd-catalyzed
amidation of 2-chloro-3-amino-substituted pyridines, and Cu- and Pd-catalyzed
amidation reaction of 3-amino-N-Boc-4-chloropyridine
using ligands (Scheme 1).9

Scheme 1 Strategies for the Synthesis of Substituted
Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines
Blagg et al. reported the synthesis of substituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines via Pd-catalyzed regioselective C2-arylation
reaction.10 Similarly, Soural and his colleagues
described the solid-supported synthesis of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines, where the polymer-supported amines reacted with the pyridine
moiety followed by SNAr reaction with amines, nitro group
reduction, and cyclization using aldehydes.11 In the case of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines, most of
the methods are based on Pd- or Cu-catalyzed amidation reaction of
2-halo-3-acylaminopyridines with amines. However, in spite of uniqueness
and diversity of the reported methods, there are several drawbacks
associated with them, which include the participation of toxic and
costly Pd or Cu catalyst in the presence of specific and costly ligands
and appropriate bases, narrow substrate scope and use of toxic solvent,
harsh reaction condition, and longer reaction time with laborious
workup procedures. Thus, the construction of the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine scaffold bearing a diverse range of substituents
at the N-1 and the C-2 positions poses a synthetic challenge. In this
context, it is requisite to develop a simple and efficient strategy
for the synthesis of biologically important substituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines. In recent times, the synthesis of active pharmaceutical
analogues in water as the solvent has attracted considerable attention
owing to the nontoxic, nonflammable nature of water, which further
fulfills all green principles.12 The poor
solubility of organic compounds in water has been overcome by the
use of an organic cosolvent.

A tandem reaction is an important
tool for the diversity-oriented
synthesis of heterocyclic small molecules to meet the demands of high-throughput
screening for drug discovery research.13 Using the H2O-IPA as the preferred reaction medium in
the design of green chemical syntheses, we therefore wished to develop
a convenient catalyst-free tandem synthesis of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines. In comparison to the already reported synthesis
protocols, the present methodology offers several advantages such
as the application of a tandem process by circumventing the classical
step-by-step approaches of using toxic transition-metal catalysts,
H2O-IPA as the green and ecofriendly solvent, excellent
yields with high purity, and a broad substrate scope. In continuation
of our quest for the development of newer synthesis methodologies
for the bioactive heterocycles,14 we aim
to utilize the tandem reaction in a green solvent for the synthesis
of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines from readily available
chemicals with excellent yields.

Results and Discussion
Our work started with the alkyl amination step, which is crucial
in introducing the substituents of the disubstituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine scaffold. The new metal- and base-free route
for the relevant C–N bond forming step involved the nucleophilic
substitution reaction of 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine 1 with
primary amines in refluxing dichloromethane as the solvent for 72
h to obtain the N-substituted pyridine-2-amine 2 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine from 2-Chloro-3-nitro
Pyridine
Nevertheless, to speed
up the process, we attempted the SNAr reaction of 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine 1 with primary
amines under refluxing 1,2-dichloroethane solvent for 24 h for completion.
However, the H2O-IPA-assisted aromatic nucleophilic substitution
of 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine with diverse amines at 80 °C greatly
reduced the reaction time to 2 h to form the intermediate N-substituted
pyridine-2-amine 2. The introduction of common linear-chain
aliphatic amines as the first diversity point in the skeleton furnished
the targeted compounds in excellent yields. Subsequently, our next
step in the synthesis sequence involved the reduction of the nitro
group, which was carried out using Zn/HCOONH3 in the methanol
solvent at room temperature. However, it took almost 24 h to complete
under room-temperature condition to furnish the substituted pyridine-2,3-diamine 3. Upon changing the solvent system to H2O-IPA
as the reaction medium using Zn/AcOH as the reducing agent at 80 °C,
the reaction took 12 h for completion. Nonetheless, to hasten the
reduction step, instead of using Zn/AcOH as the reducing agent,15 we tried Zn/HCl at 80 °C to obtain the
substituted pyridine-2,3-diamine 3 in 45 min with excellent
yields. The use of Zn/HCl as the reducing agent in H2O-IPA
as the reaction medium greatly reduced the reaction time to minutes,
which further justifies the green chemistry principles. To introduce
the second diversity point in the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
ring, pyridine-2,3-diamines 3 were subjected to heterocyclization
with substituted aldehydes under H2O-IPA at room temperature,
which took almost 2 days for completion.

To facilitate the synthesis
of the target compounds swiftly, we
conducted the same reaction at 85 °C for completion in 10 h to
yield substituted 2-aryl imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines 4. However, in an attempt to diversify the synthesis methodology,
we envisioned that the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ring 4 could be constructed by a one-pot tandem process involving
SNAr reaction–reduction–heterocyclization
reaction. The initial investigation toward the synthesis of N-aryl alkyl/alkyl-2-alkyl/aryl/heteroaryl imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines using the tandem process has been performed
(Scheme 3). Thus, 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine 1 was subjected to the SNAr reaction with different
amines in H2O-IPA as the reaction medium at 80 °C
for 2 h, and the in situ formed N-substituted products 2 were treated with Zn dust (1 equiv) and concd HCl (0.5 equiv) at
80 °C and stirred for another 45 min. The N-substituted pyridine-2,3-diamines 3 were obtained in 90% yield. However, the use of HOAc instead
of aq. HCl afforded 50% yield of 3. The formation of
the amine products 3 could also be confirmed by the color
change of the reaction mixture from yellow to blue along with the
change in the chemical shifts of aromatic regions in the 1H NMR spectra of the crude products. After the reaction was completed,
Zn dust was filtered off and the preformed 3 were next
treated with aldehydes in H2O-IPA without any metal catalyst
for 10 h to obtain the substituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines 4 in excellent yield. However, the use of polar protic solvents
such as MeOH or EtOH gave good yields, whereas the aprotic solvents
such as toluene, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and 1,2-dichloroethane
under similar conditions obtained lower yields, which demonstrates
the advantage of using H2O-IPA in the condensation stage.

Scheme 3 One-Pot Three-Step Reaction toward Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine Compounds 4
Notably, because the three steps (A, B, and C) were all
performed
in H2O-IPA, the whole procedure can be completed in one
pot without isolating the intermediates. These findings highlighted
the indispensable role of H2O-IPA in promoting the SNAr reaction–reduction–heterocyclization step
for the diversity-oriented one-pot synthesis of disubstituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines. With the one-pot reaction conditions for the
preparation of 4 in hand, we set out to investigate the
substrate scope for a range of primary amines and aldehydes. Generally,
the use of substituted aldehydes bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing
substituents or heteroaromatic aldehydes provided the corresponding
imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines in higher yields. All these
reactions were performed under an open atmosphere. Table 1 demonstrates the excellent
results for general applicability of the diversity-oriented synthesis
of 1,2-disubstituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines.

of the isolated product.

After completion of the reaction, the corresponding 1,2-disubstituted
imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives 4 were obtained with excellent yields, followed by a simple work-up
involving removal of solvents under reduced pressure, extraction,
and solvent evaporation. Finally, the crude products were purified
by column chromatography, followed by spectroscopic characterization
using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy
(MS). There are two possible pathways such as the formation of imine
intermediate (A) or the immonium intermediate (B) in the heterocyclization
step through which 1,2-disubstituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines are obtained, as outlined in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Possible Routes of the Heterocyclization
Step for the Synthesis of
1,2-Disubstituted Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
However, to understand whether
the reaction proceeds through “route
A” or “route B”, we monitored the progress of
the reaction of 3a with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde in H2O-IPA by 1H NMR (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Time-dependent 1H NMR study for reaction
of 3a with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde in H2O-IPA
(5 mL): (a) 4-nitrobenzaldehyde;
(b) reaction mixture after 10 min; (c) reaction mixture after 1 h;
and (d) reaction mixture after 10 h.

The appearance of the signals at δ 7.00 ppm and δ
8.60
ppm in the reaction mixture after 10 min of reaction suggested the
simultaneous formation of imine A and cyclized intermediate X, respectively. However, after 1 h of reaction, disappearance
of the signal at δ 7.00 ppm indicates the exclusive formation
of intermediate X. Finally, after 10 h of reaction, the
cyclized intermediate X aromatized to the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine 4 as obtained from 1H
NMR spectra. The time-dependent 1H NMR study further confirms
that the reaction proceeds via route A, which involved the formation
of imines followed by subsequent cyclization and aromatization to
obtain the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives. A
plausible mechanistic pathway for this heteroannulation reaction is
outlined in Scheme 5.

Scheme 5 Plausible Heteroannulation Mechanism toward the Formation of
Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine in Aqueous Medium
It is assumed that the water
molecule plays an important role in
the heteroannulation step because of its ability to activate both
the electrophile and nucleophile simultaneously.16 It activates the oxygen atom of the C=O group and
hydrogen atom of the NH2 group via hydrogen bonds through
the transient species Y to form the imine Z. Subsequent intramolecular
nucleophilic attack of the adjacent NH group to the C= N moiety
resulted in the formation of disubstituted dihydro imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives X, which, on further
aromatization, resulted in the disubstituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine 4. The intermediate X was isolated
and characterized by mass, IR, and NMR (1H and 13C) spectroscopies.

Finally, imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
derivatives were
screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative
(Escherichia coli and Klebsiella) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus
aureus) bacteria by the conventional serial dilution
method. The in vitro antimicrobial assay was performed at a drug concentration
of 0 to 250 μM. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values
were evaluated for all compounds. None of the compounds displayed
promising antibacterial activities with MIC values less than 40 μM
(see Supporting Information Table 1 for
complete assay).

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a distinct tandem protocol toward
rapidly accessing disubstituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
derivatives by employing 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine and primary amines
as the starting materials. Significantly, upon rational design, after
treatment of the in situ formed N-substituted pyridine-2,3-diamine
with aldehydes, a novel annulations occurs through the simultaneous
electrophile–nucelophilie activation ability of water. Further
aromatization results in the formation of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine compounds. In general, the sequential transformations can
be simply manipulated in a one-pot tandem process. The H2O-IPA-assisted tandem SNAr reaction–reduction–condensation
chemistry provides green procedures for the novel base-free one-pot
synthesis of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives in
excellent yields.

Experimental Section
Dichloromethane
and methanol were distilled from calcium hydride
before use. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All reactions
were performed under an inert atmosphere with unpurified reagents
and dry solvents. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed
using 0.25 mm silica gel-coated Kieselgel 60 F254 plates. Flash chromatography
was performed using the indicated solvent and silica gel 60 (Merck,
230–400 mesh). 1H NMR (300 and 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (75 and 100 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker
DRX 300 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million
(ppm) on the δ scale from an internal standard. High-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra were recorded on a JEOL TMS-HX 110
mass spectrometer.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 3-(Alkyl/Aralkyl)-2-aryl/heteroaryl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
To a
solution of 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine 1 (1 equiv) in H2O-IPA (5 mL, 1:1) was added primary amine (1 equiv) and was
stirred for 5 min at room temperature, and then the reaction mixture
was heated at 80 °C for 2 h to obtain the intermediate 2 as monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, to
the same reaction mixture was added Zn (1 equiv) and concd HCl (0.5
equiv), and the reaction mixture was heated for 45 min at 80 °C
to obtain the diamine derivatives 3. After completion,
the reaction mixture was then subjected to centrifugation to remove
Zn dust; to the same reaction mixture was added substituted aldehydes
(1 equiv); and the reaction mixture was heated for 10 h at 85 °C.
The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion,
the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and extracted
with ethyl acetate (10 mL, twice). The combined organic layer was
dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The combined filtrate was subjected
to evaporation to obtain the crude compound, which was purified over
silica gel column (60–120 mesh) using 15% ethyl acetate in
hexane as the eluent to obtain the corresponding 3-(alkyl/aralkyl)-2-aryl/heteroaryl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine 4 derivatives in excellent yields.
