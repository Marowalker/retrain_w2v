A series of new quinazoline derivatives
were designed and synthesized
via a one-pot condensation reaction between isatoic anhydride and
aromatic aldehydes with anilines using aluminum sulfate as a catalyst
in refluxing ethanol. Their structures were confirmed by their physical,
IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy data
and evaluated for some biological effects, including the antioxidant
and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities as well as some in vivo
hematological parameters. The ability of synthesized compounds in
the inhibition of α-glucosidase was also investigated through
the in silico study. The significant and important changes in some
hematological tests were perceived. Notably, compound 4h showed more reducing effects on cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
This molecule certainly has the potential to be developed as the antihyperlipemic
compound. The tested compounds, in particular, compounds 4j and 4l, were found to be uniquely reducing blood sugar
levels. The entire synthesized compounds showed the potent α-glucosidase
inhibitory activity compared with acarbose as a standard material.
Amongst, the compounds 4h and 4i showed
the strongest enzyme inhibitory potentials than the standard drug
acarbose. There was a good correlation between in vitro and in silico
studies for ligands 4i and 4l. The majority
of compounds presented a good radical scavenging activity, though
the compound 4j exhibited the strongest activity, even
to the standard of ascorbic acid. Further studies are required to
determine whether these main compounds could be a potential treatment
for diabetes and hyperlipidemia diseases.

==== Body
Introduction
Diabetes
mellitus is a non-infective metabolic disorder of multiple
etiologies characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with conflicts of
the protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism resulting from defects
in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.1 Normalization of blood glucose levels, especially postprandial hyperglycemia,
is important to prevent the complications of diabetes, which include
coronary heart disease, peripheral arteriopathy, retinopathy, neuropathy,
and nephropathy.2

Many natural and
synthetic chemicals have been provided a potential
source of anti-diabetic special effects and are extensively used for
the treatment of diabetes mellitus in various modern and traditional
systems of medicine worldwide. A lot of them are known to be effective
against diabetes.3

In addition to
adverse effects, many drugs that are presently used
for the management of type 2 diabetes are not always satisfactory
in maintaining normal levels of blood glucose and are facing limited
efficacy and tolerability.4,5

α-Glucosidase
belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 31 family
of the hydrolases, and its major function is the hydrolysis of the
terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked α-d-glucosidase with
the release of α-d-glucose. α-Glucosidase has
drawn special attention of the pharmaceutical research community since,
in earlier studies, it was revealed that the inhibition of its catalytic
activity resulted in the retardation of glucose absorption and decrease
in postprandial blood glucose level.2 α-Glucosidase
inhibitors play an important role to delay or inhibit the digestion
or absorption of carbohydrates and suppress the postprandial hyperglycemia.6 Hence, they have broad aspects and many potentially
expedient in the management of type 2 diabetes.

Heterocyclic
compounds are of special interest to the medicinal
chemists due to their unique biological properties.2 Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds are the most
abundant and integral scaffolds that occur entirely in a variety of
synthetic drugs, bioactive natural products, and pharmaceuticals.7 The presence of N-heterocycles
as an essential structural motif in a variety of biologically active
substances has stimulated the development of the novel technologies
and strategies for their synthesis. Among the N-containing
heterocycles, quinazolinone is a building block of approximately 200
naturally occurring alkaloids isolated to date from a number of plants,
microorganisms, and animals.7 The first
quinazolinone was synthesized in the late 1860s from cyanogens and
anthranilic acid to give 2-cyanoquinazolinone.8

On a quest to find further potential quinazolinone-based drugs,
various substituted quinazolinones have been synthesized.9 The quinazolinone derivatives have shown various
biological activities such as antimalarial,10 anticancer,11 anti-HIV,12 antimicrobial,13 anti-inflammatory,14 antitubercular,15 antihypertensive,16 and cholinesterase
inhibition17 activities. This broad spectrum
of effects has been further facilitated by the synthetic versatility
of quinazolinones, which authorizes the generation of numerous structurally
various molecules.18 The antidiabetic19 and antioxidant13 activities of these compounds were also appraised.20,21

Considering the importance of these compounds, several methods
have been revealed for the synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones. They are usually synthesized by three-component
reactions of aldehydes, isatoic anhydrides, primary amines, or ammonium
salts, in the presence of numerous catalysts, under different circumstances.22−25 Some of these reagents or catalysts are cerium(IV) sulfate,26 (Cu-CNTs),27 choline
chloride in the presence of malonic acid,28 silica-bonded propyl-S-sulfonic acid (SBSSA),29 silica-bonded N-propyl sulfamic
acid (SBNPSA),30 and Al(H2PO4)3.31 Some of these
methods have limitations such as long reaction time, high-temperature
reaction, side reactions producing a mixture of products and complex
separation, and purification methods. In the current study, we developed
the synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones
in the presence of aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3·6H2O) as a catalyst in ethanol. Furthermore,
pyrazol-quinazolinones as the new derivatives of quinazolinones were
synthesized by replacing aromatic aldehyde with pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde
(compounds 4g–4l). Moreover, our
catalyst-based method has benefits such as having less reaction time,
high performance, and environmental compatibility and being a low-cost
catalyst and nontoxic.

Free radicals are reactive chemicals
that are short-lived species
having one or more unpaired electrons. They induce injury to organism
cells by a small increase in the unpaired electron resulting in cell
biomolecules oxidation.32

One possible
hypothesis in diabetes is that the disease state leads
to an increase in active oxygen species production. In addition to
the starring role of oxidative stress in the onset of diabetes, it
seems to play a key role in chronic complications of the disease.
It has been reported that the free radical scavengers are effective
in avoiding diabetes in animal models.33−36 However, recent shreds of evidence
have revealed that first-line therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention
and the most important lipid-lowering drugs such as statins can increase
the risk of new-onset diabetes.37,38 It is assumed to have
a direct correlation between antidiabetic and antioxidant potentials
of compounds. A number of studies revealed that a compound exhibiting
a higher glucose-lowering effect appears to have a good antioxidant
potential as well.39−42 Moreover, it has been alleged that some drugs can alter normal hematological
values.43,44 Hence, the hematological parameters could
be a crucial factor in their toxic effect evaluations;45 though, it is believed that some antioxidant
agents can combat oxidative stress and improve the hematological status.46 Clinically, it is needed to develop the new
therapeutic approaches with the novel generation of drugs lacking
these side effects. Here, in this study, we are reporting the synthesis
of some new derivatives of quinazolines and their hematological and
antioxidant activities, α-glucosidase inhibitory potential,
and molecular docking studies.

Results and Discussion
The catalytic
activity of aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3·6H2O) was investigated in the
synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolinones via a one-pot three-component
condensation reaction between aromatic aldehydes and isatoic anhydride
with aniline derivatives. In a preliminary study, the reaction of
isatoic anhydride and 5-chloro-3-methyl-1-phenylpyrazole-4-carbaldehyde
with aniline was selected as a model reaction in refluxing ethanol
(Table 1). To illustrate
the need of Al2(SO4)3·6H2O for this condensation, we examined the model reaction in
the absence of Al2(SO4)3·6H2O in refluxing ethanol (Table 1, entry 1). The results exhibit clearly that Al2(SO4)3·6H2O is an effective
catalyst for this transformation, and in the absence of Al2(SO4)3·6H2O, the reaction did
not take place even after 10 h. Also, when we used other aluminum
species such as aluminum trichloride and acidic alumina as a catalyst,
the corresponding product was obtained in low yields (Table 1, entries 14 and 15). As indicated
in Table 1, the best
results were obtained with 0.06 mmol of Al2(SO4)3·6H2O in refluxing ethanol (Table 1, entry 12).

In order
to synthesize 2,3-dihydroquinazolinones, the reaction
between aromatic aldehydes (2) and isatoic anhydride
with aniline derivatives (3) was investigated under optimized
conditions. As shown in Table 2, aniline derivatives such as 4-hydroxyaniline, 3-chloroaniline,
and 4-methylaniline and those treated with aromatic aldehydes and
isatoic anhydride and corresponding products were obtained in good
to high yields. The novel classes of pyrazol-quinazolinones were synthesized
by replacing 5-chloro-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde
instead of aromatic aldehyde. These new derivatives were achieved
in good to high yields under optimized reaction conditions.

According to Table 2, the desired product was well
reached by aromatic aldehydes with
the electron donor and acceptor substituents under reaction conditions.
On the other hand, this reaction was carried out well and raced up
by aromatic amines due to their high nucleophilic power. The recommended
mechanism to provide the 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones by Al2(SO4)3·6H2O as the catalyst is shown in Figure 1. First, the catalyst activated the carbonyl
isatoic anhydride group to get the compound ready for an amine group
attack. This is due to the C–O bond breaking in the carbonyl
group and forming the intermediate (i). Consequently, a CO2 molecule and catalyst left the compound, and an intermediate was
attained (ii). Then, the catalyst-activated aldehyde group was attacked
by an ammonium nitrogen lone pair and compound (iii) was obtained.
To summarize, the product was obtained by hydrogen displacement and
ring formation.

Biological Activities
From the newly
synthesized compounds,
to study the donor–acceptor substituent effects on some biological
activities, the compounds 4g, 4h, 4i, 4j, 4k, and 4l were
selected.

Antioxidant Activity
Recently, antioxidants have attracted
much attention in relation to oxidative stress and radicals, cancer
prophylaxis and therapy, and longevity.47 To study the free radical scavenging ability of the synthesized
compounds (4g–4l), the DPPH [diphenyl-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium]
assay was used. The DPPH assay method is based on reduction of DPPH,
a stable free radical.48 The results are
presented in Table 3.

All compounds presented the
good radical scavenging in a dose-dependent
manner at concentrations of 0.2–1.0 μM compared to the
control group (Table 3), while the compound 4j showed strong inhibitory activity,
stronger than ascorbic acid as a standard. This compound showed a
significant inhibitory effect with the increase in concentrations
(p < 0.05) but not statistically significant between
concentrations of 0.8 and 1 μg/mL. This is probably due to the
greater involvement of chlorine substitution in free radical stabilization
in the relevant doses. The second potent compound was 4i (80.07 ± 0.77 to 86.47 ± 0.27%). This was followed by
compounds 4k, 4l, 4g, and 4h in different concentrations. In these four compounds, the
inhibition values showed a transient increase, with a mild gradient
in a dose-dependent manner.

The most and least inhibition values
were associated with 4-Cl
and 4-Me substrates, respectively, and then, the higher inhibitory
activities were observed in rings with −Cl as an acceptor substitute
in comparison to Me as the donor. This may be due to the stability
of the electric charge throughout the component DPPH by the acceptor
agent (Cl), where, in Me, the substrate charge becomes unstable after
mixing two molecules.

The formed free radical is well stable
owing to the proper location
of chlorine for the electron-withdrawing effect in the para position.
This belongs to the inductive effect of electron-withdrawing groups.
However, in our other structures with electron-donating groups, the
stereoelectronic effect of the phenyl ring is the main reason for
the competition between the inductive effect and electron cloud deployment.
Electron cloud deployment further demonstrates its effect on free
radical stability.

Generally, the antioxidant capacity depends
on several particular
structural properties, such as the electronegativity, position, and
number of functional groups in the antioxidant molecule. Therefore,
the choice of models with particular functional groups for measuring
the antioxidant capacity influences the results. Among the abovementioned
contents, the higher antioxidant content of compound 4k rather than 4h can be due to the position of functional
groups in the molecule 4k.49 As shown in Figure 2, the phenyl ring in compound 4k has less free rotation
around the C–N bond than the 4h structure. This
is due to the steric congestion of methyl in the ortho position and
its inhibition rather than that of the carbonyl group. Consistent
with the result of Ichikawa et al., it would appear that the ring
A in compound 4k is fixed and its electron cloud belonging
to the π orbital of the aromatic ring can more easily overlap
and stabilize the single electron of DPPH.50

Figure 2 Comparison
of the free rotation between molecules 4h and 4k.

It is a good approximation to
think of the geometry of free radicals
as a shallow pyramid, which allows for overlap of the half-filled
p orbital with adjacent π bonds. Also, the stereoelectronic
effect is defined by the preferred mode of the approach of a radical
as it bonds to the π-electron system of an alkene group. When
comparing our results to Broggi et al., it must be pointed out that
single electrons can overlap with the adjacent p orbitals as shown
in Figure 3.51 To prove this, molecules 4k and 4l were compared. Comparison between ligands showed that ligand 4l exhibits lower inhibition percentage due to its more free
rotation.

Figure 3 Intermolecular interaction between single electrons with the adjacent
p orbitals.

Free radicals are stabilized by
adjacent groups with lone pairs.
Nitrogen, oxygen, and some halogens have lone pairs of electrons and
can donate electron density to the half-empty p orbital, which stabilizes
the free radical system that is a hyperconjugation effect. This is
an interaction between a half-empty orbital (the free radical) and
a filled orbital (the lone pair of oxygen). Probably for this reason,
the inhibitory percentage of molecule 4i is high.

The excess free radicals circulating in the body oxidize the low-density
lipoproteins (LDL), making them potentially lethal; the excess free
radicals can also accelerate aging processes and have been linked
to other very serious pathologies, such as brain stroke, diabetes
mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s
disease, and cancer.47,52 The essential features of oxidation
via a free radical-mediated chain reaction are initiation, propagation,
branching, and termination steps.53 The
process may be initiated by the action of outside agents such as heat,
light, or ionizing radiation or by chemical initiation involving metal
ions or metalloproteins. There is great attention in antioxidants,
predominantly in those planned to prevent the presumed harmful properties
of free radicals in the human body as well as the deterioration of
fats and other ingredients of foodstuffs.53

Compound 4j was found to be an excellent antioxidant
agent. It is an appropriate candidate for further development as antioxidants.
Further studies are required to determine whether compound 4j could be a potential treatment for some notable diseases caused
by oxidative stress, such as neural disorders, lung diseases, cancer,
heart disease, and diabetes.

Studies on the antioxidant effects
of similar compounds are limited.
According to Tong et al., acortatarins A, one of the two novel alkaloids
with a naturally unusual morpholine motif isolated from the rhizome
of Acorus tatarinowii, could significantly
inhibit reactive oxygen species production in high-glucose-stimulated
mesangial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.54 Similarly, Chiou et al. have shown that the synthetic compound
magnolamide from pyrrole-2,5-dicarbaldehyde definitely inhibited CuSO4-induced oxidation of human LDL (IC50 = 9.7 μM),
with similar activity to the antioxidant standards probucol and resveratrol.55

At one glance, the measurable changes
in hematological parameter
values were observed compared to their control groups (Table 4).

According to Lawal
et al., the erythrocyte parameters comprising
the RBC, Hb, MCH, MCHC, and RDW are appropriate indicators of the
circulatory erythrocyte levels and offer the valuable indexes of the
bone marrow capacity to produce the RBC following the administration
of drugs, toxins, or plant extracts.56 In
line with the ideas of Mishra and Tandon, it can be revealed that
a significant increase in Hb (4j), RBC (4h and 4j), and MCHC (4h and 4k) following treatment with two 0.3 and 0.5 mM doses of quinazoline
derivatives may indicate the stimulation of erythropoiesis by these
chemicals.57

According to the results,
a dramatically significant increase was
observed in the serum cholesterol and TG levels between the diabetic
and the normal groups (p < 0.5). These factors
were remarkably improved dose-dependently after administration of
two doses of all quinazoline derivatives compared to the diabetic
group (p < 0.05). However, the compound 4h has shown more reducing effects on cholesterol and TG concentrations
(p < 0.05). This may be due to steric effect and
the smaller size of this molecule than other molecules, which makes
it more reactive. These molecules certainly have the potential to
be developed as antihyperlipemic compounds.

Hyperlipidemia is
the presence of high levels of lipids in the
blood. It is a metabolic derangement caused by many diseases, especially
cardiovascular diseases.58 There are many
classes of lipid-lowering agents. All these drugs have different mechanisms
of action. However, these lipid-lowering drugs possess various side
effects. Hence, research is continuing to discover novel agents that
are more potent and safe.59 The quinazolinone
derivatives are found to have various biological activities, including
anti-hyperlipidemic activities.58,59

Kurogi et al.
showed that the quinazolines and 4(3H)-quinazolinones
are hypolipidemic agents. They have reduced the
triglyceride and total cholesterol levels.60 According to Kusunoki et al., the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activator
NO-1886 (ibrolipim) shows antiobesity effects in high-fat-induced
obese rats.61 This quinazoline derivative
decreased the levels of plasma triglycerides, nonesterified free fatty
acids, and glucose as well as the enhancement of LPL activity in animal
skeletal muscle.61 Promising results obtained
from the subchronic study of Refaie et al.62 revealed the antihyperlipidemic effect of quinazolinone compounds
by inhibition of dietary cholesterol absorption and/or intestinal
human acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity. The significant
reductions in serum total cholesterol, triacylglycerol levels, and
cholesterol ester were observed in their study.61 Similarly, a decrease in serum cholesterol and TG levels
of some synthetic novel quinazoline derivatives, as well as significantly
increased in the serum HDL level has shown by Kathiravan et al.63

Moreover, it was found that all verified
compounds showed a significant
decrease in creatinine level as compared with the diabetic control
group (p < 0.05).

According to very recent
studies, the most important lipid-lowering
drugs have even caused diabetes mellitus disease.37,64 A meta-analysis study by Wang et al. showed that statin therapy
and the relative reduction in LDL are associated with a risk of new-onset
diabetes.38 Previously, Simonen et al.
have demonstrated that diabetes is evidently associated with high
cholesterol synthesis and mild elevated serum and lipoprotein triglyceride
levels.65 They have verified that the insulin-resistant
fat cells release the extensive free fatty acids to the circulation.
In their study, lipoprotein synthesis had also increased. Their findings
showed a direct association between blood sugar levels and cholesterol
synthesis.65 Therefore, the offering of
such drugs with potentially concurrent beneficial effects on both
diseases in the future of drug discovery is really promising.

Administration of a derivative (4j) resulted in higher
levels of WBC in these treated groups compared to the nondiabetic
control group (p < 0.05), but not more than the
diabetic control group, while it was significantly reduced in diabetic
mice that received the compound 4k compared to the control
groups at two levels of concentrations. All molecules had significant
differences with normal and diabetic groups (p <
0.05). This did not include the molecule 4h at a concentration
of 0.5 μM compared to the normal control group.

The highest
mean RBC level was observed in the presence of the
compound 4h, compared to the other molecules and both
control groups (p < 0.05). In this parameter,
all desired molecules in both concentrations had a significant difference
compared to the diabetic group. This result ties well with previous
studies that reported the significant increase in response to the
administration of chemicals.56,57

However, the
molecule 4k had a significant difference
compared to the normal group. Then, the influence of the 2,4-di-Me
substituents in the molecule 4k could be remarkable.

From the perspective of the association between antioxidant and
hematological effects, the study of Kelkar et al.46 revealed that antioxidants can combat oxidative stress
and improve the hematological status such as Hb and RBC levels. Others
have shown that the chemicals with antioxidant activities can improve
the hematological parameters.66,67

The deleterious
effects of diabetes mellitus on hematological parameters
were also reported by Oyedemi et al..68

Serum creatinine level is the most common index of renal function.
As indicated, administering the desired compounds significantly decreased
the creatinine levels compared to the diabetic groups in the animal
model. In line with the finding of Tsompos et al., we speculate that
our antioxidant agents may improve renal function by increasing creatinine
excretion.69 The effects of antioxidants
on the creatinine level were in accordance with the results of Dennis
and Witting.70 Hence, introducing a novel
uncomplicated drug with the revealed effects can be a great aid for
these patients.

The HCT (in 0.3 mM) and Hb levels were decreased
significantly
alone in the group that received the compound 4k. Except
for the molecule 4j, at a dose of 0.5 μM, all confirmed
molecules had significant differences compared to the diabetic group
(p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes
were observed in the HCT levels in the mice exposed to the compound 4j at a dose of 0.3 μM compared to the normal group.
The significant increases were observed in the MCHC and PLT levels
in groups that received 4k and 4h compounds
compared to the diabetic group (p < 0.05).

A number of chemicals and natural products have been scientifically
tested and reported possessing the ability to decrease blood glucose
levels of normal and/or diabetic animals.61−74

The mean blood glucose concentrations were determined to be
70
± 2 and 57 ± 2 (mM) in the control group in doses of 0.3
and 0.5 mM and 365 ± 4 and 524 ± 6 in the diabetic group,
respectively. Table 5 shows that treatment of diabetic mice with six quinazoline derivatives
(4g–4l) caused a significant and
dose-dependent reduction in blood sugar levels compared to both control
groups (p < 0.05).

Glucose Levels (in mM)

a Limit of quantification.

Administration of both doses of compounds 4j and 4l resulted in a significant collapse in blood glucose levels
as much as below the limit of quantification of the method (LOQ =
20 mM). Such a reduction was also perceived in compound 4k at a dose of 0.5 mM. These tested compounds were found to be uniquely
reducing sugar levels.

As a whole, our hematological study revealed
that the quinazoline
derivatives are safe from the viewpoint of hematotoxicity and can
even recover the hematological side effects associated with diabetes
mellitus.

α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activity
α-Glucosidase
is a catabolic enzyme that regulates the body’s plasma glucose
levels by providing energy sources to maintain healthy functioning.
α-Glucosidase inhibitor drugs reduce the glucose level of blood
as a strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.75

All the synthesized compounds showed the potent inhibitory
potential ranging from (2.6 ± 0.1, 2.5 ± 0.1 μM) to
(29.3 ± 0.5 , 25.4 ± 0.6 μM) in 0.3 and 0.5 mM of
samples, respectively, compared to acarbose as a standard with IC50 = 34.4 ± 0.3 and 30.1 ± 0.2 μM. The IC50 levels in all the test compounds decreased compared to that
of the standard drug (p < 0.05). Also, as shown
in Table 6, the IC50 values in both concentrations of the samples (0.3 and 0.5
mM) were dose-dependently decreased in all tests and standard compounds.
Amongst all the synthesized compounds, the derivatives 4h, 4i, and 4l showed the strongest enzyme
inhibitory potential than the standard drug acarbose.

In a series of recent studies, some quinazoline derivatives
were
reported as extremely active α-glucosidase inhibitors for controlling
hyperglycemia.76−78 In the study of Gurram et al., a series of 21 synthesized
novel quinazoline derivatives have been screened against α-glucosidase.76 Among all the tested molecules, seven compounds
showed <20 μM activity to α-glucosidase, and six compounds
showed exhibited excellent inhibition activities when compared to
acarbose (6.2 μM), with the IC50 values between 3.2
and 8.6 μM.76 These results are comparable
to our study results.

These findings are also consistent with
the research study of Babar
et al., showing that a synthetic quinazoline compound has a potent
inhibitory effect toward α-glucosidase with an IC50 value of 150.4 ± 1.9 μM compared to acarbose (336.9 ±
9.0 μM) as the standard.79 This is
consistent with what has been found in the previous study of Garlapati
et al..80 They investigated the 25 synthesized
quinazoline compounds to biological assays against α-glucosidase
and found that three compounds were potentially active as α-glucosidase
inhibitors and showed activity with IC50 values of <10
μM. They have demonstrated that these main compounds are excellent
candidates for further pharmacological applications.

Docking Study
To find the correlation between the experimental
and computational data, the docking study of the compounds was performed
against α-glucosidase enzyme inhibitory activities. According
to the binding site in α-glucosidase, the desired compound would
be able to form the different types of molecular bonds with the α-glucosidase
structure and making it a favorable binding site. The estimated binding
energies (kcal/mol) of the 10 clusters are presented in Table 7.

Among the 10 clusters, the preeminent
results for each molecule
from the perspective of their binding energies (kcal/mol), Ki (μM),
and other conformation information were selected for further examinations
(Table 8).

Our docking results
showed that all compounds have more stability
than acarbose as the control group (Table 8). The best conformations from the docking
procedure with the best-scored pose and the lowest binding energy
(about −6.1 to −8.85 kcal/mol) were selected for these
ligands (4g–4l). From the docking
results, compound 4i with the OH substituent at the para
position exhibited the least binding energy with α-glucosidase
that shows the overcoming of hydrogen bonding rather than other polar
effects in these compounds. Table 9 shows the number of different types of molecular bonds
between ligands and the α-glucosidase.

At this stage
of understanding, it can be construed that the high
binding affinity of compounds 4i and 4l is
related to the greater number of the van der Waals and hydrogen bond
between the enzyme and ligand (Figure 4). According to Table 9, π–anion, π–cation, and
π–π interactions are less important. We speculate
that the low affinity of the molecule 4j with the enzyme
may be due to the steric effect of chlorine than other substitutions
in the para position. Furthermore, the electron-withdrawing (EWG)
and the electron-donating groups (EDG) had almost similar effects
(4i > 4l > 4g > 4h > 4j > 4k > acarbose).
The higher energy
in acarbose may be due to the absence of π interactions in its
structure (Figure 4).

When comparing the
results of Figure 4, it must be pointed out that the molecules 4i and 4l with the single substituent in the
para position had the highest number of amino acid residues (20 amino
acids). Also, the number of amino acids in 4h, 4k, and acarbose is the same. Generally, the number of residues
increases from 4h to 4l (4i and 4l > 4g > 4j > 4h, 4k, and acarbose).

The comparison between
the amino acid residues of the molecules
and acarbose showed that the highest share of amino acids was related
to the compound 4g with 13 amine acids (Phe144, Phe163,
Tyr63, Asp326, His103, Asn324, Phe282, Asn258, Ala200, Asp199, Val100,
Glu256, and Arg197). Phe163, Asn258, Asp199, Glu256, and Ala200 were
common in all compounds similar to acarbose, where the two amino acids
Arg411 and Leu258 found in acarbose have not existed in any of the
relevant molecules.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the quinazoline
derivatives from pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde
and amines, particularly molecules 4i and 4l, were a potent and amazing anti-α-glucosidase agent with strong
binding to enzyme that correlated well with the experimental data.
There was a good association between in vitro and in silico studies.
The hematological study of the desired compounds revealed that the
quinazoline derivatives are safe from the viewpoint of hematotoxicity
and seem to improve the hematological abnormalities associated with
diabetes mellitus in the animal model. In addition, these findings
provide additional information about the molecule 4h that
certainly has the potential to be developed as antihyperlipemic drugs
because of its excellent reducing effects on cholesterol and TG levels.
The majority of compounds, particularly the compound 4j, presented the exceptional radical scavenging. This conclusion follows
from the fact that the antioxidant agents improved the hematological
parameters. This is desirable for future work after the safety evaluation
of the compounds.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
General
All chemicals were purchased from the Fluka,
Merck, and Aldrich chemical companies. All products were characterized
by comparison of their FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared), 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopic data.

The study
was permitted by the Medical Ethics Committee of Bushehr University
of Medical Sciences and Health Services, Bushehr-Iran, and a written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects of study. All animal
works were carried out in accordance with the National Ethical Guidelines
for Animal Research in Iran (2005) under a project license, which
was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Persian Gulf,
according to the protocol PG/FS/CHDO2. All animals were kept in a
climate-controlled environment at 25 °C on a 12 h light/12 h
dark cycle. Adequate food and water were available during all experimental
processes, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

1-Aryl-5-chloro-3-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde
General Preparation
First, 64 mL of phosphoryl chloride (0.7
M) was added dropwise to 23 mL of ice-cold dimethylformamide (0.3
M). After adding 17.5 g of 3-methyl-1-phenyl-5-pyrazolone (0.1 M),
the mixture was heated under reflux conditions for 1 h. At room temperature,
a volume of 600 mL of cold water was added to the mixture and filtered
and then recrystallized from ethanol.

2,3-Dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones General Synthesis
Method
To a mixture of isatoic anhydride (1 mmol), 5-chloro-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde (3) (1 mmol), and
aniline derivatives (1 mmol) in 5 mL of ethanol was added to 0.027
g of Al2(SO4)3·6H2O and heated under reflux conditions. The reaction progress was monitored
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). After completing the reaction,
the solvent was removed. The mixture was cooled to precipitate the
corresponding pyrazol-quinazolinone products, which were finally purified
by column chromatography on silica gel using n-hexane/ethyl
acetate as an eluent.

Antioxidant Activity
The antioxidant activities (AA
%) of the products were performed by the free radical DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl;
Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) according to the Buritz and Bucar method.81 Dispersing delocalized electrons all over the
molecule makes DPPH a free stable radical. The delocalized electron
causes a deep purple color at λmax = 517 nm. When
a solution of DPPH is mixed with a substrate acting as a hydrogen
atom donor, a stable, nonradical form of DPPH is obtained with a simultaneous
change in color from violet to pale yellow. Briefly, 50 mL from each
of the methanolic solutions (4h, 4j, and 4k), in different dilutions of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0
μg/mL, was mixed with 5 mL of the DPPH methanolic solution (0.004%).
The DPPH solution was kept in a dark place. After 30 min incubation,
the absorbances of the samples were measured using a Cecil Aquarius
CE7200 double-beam spectrophotometer (Cecil, England) at 517 nm. The
methanolic solutions of six compounds and DPPH were used as blank
and control samples, respectively. Inhibition (I)
of the DPPH radical in percent (%) was calculated by the following
equation  where Ablank is
the absorbance at 517 nm after a period of 30 min without the addition
of the antioxidant and Asample is the
absorbance in the presence of the antioxidant.

An Inhibition
value versus different concentrations diagram was used to calculate
IC50. Results are expressed as the antioxidant amount that
reduces the DPPH concentration to 50% of the initial value.82 All measurements were repeated three times.

Hematological Study In Vivo
For some hematological
studies in vivo of the compounds (4h, 4j, and 4k), including the blood glucose levels, 40 male
mice (weighing approximately 20 ± 2 g) from the animal house
of the Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr-Iran, were
randomly divided into eight groups (n = 5). After
fasting for 18 h, the experimental diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal
(ip) injection of 0.5 mL of a single dose of 50 mg/kg aloxan. After
5 days of the aloxan injection, for monitoring of glucose, the blood
tail was measured using a glucometer (Bionime Rightest GM 300, Switzerland),
and animals with a blood glucose value of over 200 mg/dL were assumed
to be diabetic.83 Furthermore, animals
were observed for general signs of diabetes like polydipsia, hyperphagia,
and polyuria during the study. This group of animals was considered
as a positive control group. Six groups of animals have separately
received 0.5 mL of the compounds (4h, 4j, and 4k) at the doses of 10 and 20 (mg/kg, ip) for
1 week. Also, one group of animals was given saline as a negative
control group. For hematological parameters in vivo, the animals were
anesthetized with diethyl ether. A blood sample of each animal was
collected by cardiac punctures into both EDTA (10%) tubes for directly
hematological tests and without anticoagulant tubes for biochemical
examinations. The performance evaluations of hematological parameters
include RBC, WBC, Hb, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PLT, RDW, and HCT and were performed
using the Sysmex XE-5000 hematology analyzer. All tests were done
in triplicate, and the data were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical
analysis was carried out using the Kruskal–Wallis test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For
chemical analysis of serum electrolytes, a portion of free anticoagulant
blood samples, which were previously described, were centrifuged at
600g for 15 min and the supernatant was separated
as the serum. Serum albumin, uric acid, glucose, triglyceride, and
cholesterol were also measured.

α-Glucosidase Inhibitory
Activity
The α-glucosidase
inhibitory activities of the compounds were evaluated spectrophotometrically
using a previously published method with some modifications.75 Briefly, for each compound, 20 μL of 0.5
U/mL of α-glucosidase solution was mixed with 120 μL of
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) and 10 μL of the
sample (0.3 mM, in buffer). Acarbose was used as a standard inhibitor.
Each mixture was separately incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The
enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 20 μL of the substrate
4-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) (5 mM) in
the buffer.

The mixture was repetitively incubated at 37 °C
for 15 min. At that point, the reaction was stopped by adding 80 μL
of sodium carbonate solution (0.2 M). The enzyme-free mixture was
also used as a blank sample. Finally, the absorbance was measured
at 405 nm. The blank sample in which the substrate was changed with
50 μL of the buffer was analyzed to accurately determine the
background absorbance. The positive control sample (acarbose) was
prepared to contain 10 μL of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) instead
of test samples. The percentage of enzyme inhibition was calculated
as (1 – B/A) × 100,
where A represents the absorbance of control without
test samples and B represents the absorbance in the
presence of test samples. Analyses were carried out in triplicates,
and the results were expressed as mean ± SD.

Computational
Details
The binding affinities between
the identified structures (in addition to acarbose as the control
compound) and the active site of the α-glucosidase receptor
were examined through docking studies using the AutoDock Tools 1.5.6
Workspace.84 Interactive visualization
and analyses of the molecular structures were carried out in the Discovery
Studio R2 64-bit Client system. The three-dimensional (3D) structure
of α -glucosidase was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data
Bank (PDB). The chemical structures of the ligands were obtained from
the PubChem compound database. Open Babel was used to convert the
PDB files to the PDBQT file. For docking analysis, PDB coordinates
of the target proteins and ligands were optimized. Geometry optimization
is performed using Gaussian 09 (adding missing residues). These coordinates
had minimum energy and a stable conformation.
