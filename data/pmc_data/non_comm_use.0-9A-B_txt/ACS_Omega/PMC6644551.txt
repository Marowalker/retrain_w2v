Nanostructured noble-metal catalysts
traditionally suffer from
sintering under high operating temperatures, leading to durability
issues and process limitations. The encapsulation of nanostructured
catalysts to prevent loss of activity through thermal sintering, while
maintaining accessibility of active sites, remains a great challenge
in the catalysis community. Here, we report a robust and regenerable
palladium-based catalyst, wherein palladium particles are intercalated
into the three-dimensional framework of SBA-15-type mesoporous silica.
The encapsulated Pd active sites remain catalytically active as demonstrated
in high-temperature/pressure phenol hydrodeoxygenation reactions.
The confinement of Pd particles in the walls of SBA-15 prevents particle
sintering at high temperatures. Moreover, a partially deactivated
catalyst containing intercalated particles is regenerated almost completely
even after several reaction cycles. In contrast, Pd particles, which
are not encapsulated within the SBA-15 framework, sinter and do not
recover prior activity after a regeneration procedure.

1 Introduction
The depletion of petroleum and increasing CO2 emissions
require sustainable approaches to produce liquid fuels and platform
chemicals from renewable resources.1 In
this regard, the catalytic valorization of lignocellulosic biomass
is a promising route due to its high abundance.2 Various downstream technologies can upgrade renewable feedstocks
to high-value chemicals like benzene, toluene, and xylenes, or deoxygenated
bio-oils with excellent fuel properties.3−5 Hydrotreating bio-oil
is necessary to remove oxygen and saturate aromatic rings. Hydrodeoxygenation
(HDO) is a desired pathway, as it removes oxygen in the form of water,
thereby retaining maximum carbon content in the final biomass-derived
product.6 For the HDO of bio-oils, multifunctional
catalysts are required, bearing active sites for both the hydrogenation
(HYD) and deoxygenation reactions.7 Nanostructured
palladium-based catalysts have received significant attention for
decades due to their high activity8 and
remain among the foremost effective hydrogenation and deoxygenation
catalysts.9−11 HDO of phenolics over noble metals, such as Pd, typically
proceeds over the hydrogenation (HYD) route, in which the aromatic
ring is hydrogenated first, followed by cleavage of the aliphatic
carbon–oxygen bond.12,13 The cycloalkanes formed
from HDO of biomass constituents over noble-metal catalysts possess
a higher heating value,14 making them attractive
for the production of biofuels.15,16

Nevertheless,
the challenge remains to design catalysts that are
thermally robust, resistant to coking and deactivation, and regenerable,
without compromising accessibility to active sites.17−19 This is particularly
important for nanostructured palladium-based catalysts, which are
highly susceptible to particle sintering at elevated temperatures,
exposure to chemicals, and interaction with reactive atmospheres.20 Studies have been conducted to understand the
mechanism of Pd particle sintering,21,22 but few provide
effective mitigation approaches. The encapsulation of noble-metal
nanoparticles within porous silica shells is a promising method to
prevent sintering.23,24 However, poor control of the
shell thickness can lead to heterogeneity in particle size.25 Moreover, encapsulation of active sites can
cause decreased catalytic activity due to mass-transfer limitations
imposed by the support.26

In contrast,
mesoporous silica supports are thermally and chemically
stable, electronically inert, and only mildly acidic.27−29 The tunability of pore size allows for the accommodation of larger
reactants, and the low acidity prevents unwanted byproduct formation
and coking.30 The incorporation of palladium
into SBA-15-type mesoporous silica (PdMS) using one-pot synthesis31 or two-step wet impregnation techniques32,33 has been reported. However, without the use of metal-directing agents,
palladium particles are located in the mesopore channels of the support,
which causes pore blockage with increasing palladium loading. Numerous
studies report the functionalization of the silica pores using sulfur-containing
silanes and siloxanes, which are shown to stabilize palladium particles
and control particle size.34−36 The use of sulfur-containing
siloxyl compounds has even been shown to act as a chelating agent
for noble-metal salts, such as gold chloride, which co-condense with
silica precursors. The resulting material consists of particles confined
within the framework of SBA-15, which are resistant to deactivation
by particle sintering.37 In doing this,
three-dimensionally organized nanocomposite catalysts are realized,
which are more thermally and chemically robust than particles stabilized
inside the channels of mesoporous silica.

Herein, we report
a one-pot synthesis for the preparation of a
stable and regenerable HDO catalyst (PdMS), consisting of Pd nanoparticles
intercalated into the wall framework of SBA-15-type mesoporous silica.
Highly dispersed, palladium particles are stabilized by sulfide metal-directing
agents and are incorporated by a co-condensation reaction into the
framework of SBA-15. The HDO of phenol is investigated, as numerous
studies of phenol HDO over silica and mesoporous silica-supported
palladium have been reported.38−40 The catalytic activity and stability
of PdMS are compared to a reference catalyst (Pd/SBA-15) containing
only surface-supported (no intercalation) Pd particles. It is found
that the confinement in the SBA-15 walls promotes the formation of
particles with a narrow size distribution and effectively prevents
particle growth and irreversible deactivation, while maintaining accessibility
of Pd active sites.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Material Properties of PdMS and Pd/SBA-15
Catalysts
The synthesis of PdMS involves a one-pot modified
sol–gel preparation, which is described in the Experimental Section. The addition of bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]tetrasulfide
(TESPTS) and PdCl2 during the formation of SBA-15 integrates
Pd into the wall framework of SBA-15 (Figure 1a,c). Despite this incorporation of Pd into
the framework, SBA-15 retains its “noodlelike” structure
(Figure S1, Supporting Information). The
reference material (Pd/SBA-15) was also prepared by nucleating small
Pd particles on the external surface area of SBA-15 (Figure 1b,d), following a previously
reported synthesis.41 The two catalysts
were synthesized to have similar Pd content according to inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis: 2.6
wt % Pd in PdMS and 1.9 wt % in Pd/SBA-15.

The yellow spheres denote the location of palladium particles in the
SBA-15 support. The small white lines denote the sub-2 nm micropores
found in SBA-15. (a, c) Palladium particles are intercalated
into the walls of SBA-15 in PdMS. (b, d) Palladium particles in Pd/SBA-15
are located in the pores of the SBA-15 support and on the external
surface area.

Both ex situ and in situ
thermal studies were performed under inert
atmosphere up to 900 °C on PdMS and Pd/SBA-15, to investigate
the influence of temperature on Pd particle size and SBA-15 support
properties. At elevated reaction temperatures, the probability for
particle mobility and sintering increases as surface atoms become
more mobile.42 The temperature of 900 °C
is also above the decomposition temperature of any palladium oxide
(PdO) species, which may form due to small concentrations of atmospheric
contamination,22 and below the temperature
where SBA-15 loses all porosity.43

The effect of heat treatment on the material surface area was investigated
via nitrogen physisorption at 77 K (Figure 2). SBA-15, Pd/SBA-15, and PdMS exhibit type
IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) with an H1 hysteresis loop (Figure 2a,c,e). The mesopore
size distributions of SBA-15, Pd/SBA-15, and PdMS were obtained from
the desorption branch of the isotherm from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) analysis (Figure 2b,d,f). The rapid increase in nitrogen uptake at P/P0 ∼ 0.6 is consistent with a
narrow pore size distribution with uniform cylindrical pores.44 The heat treatment at 900 °C has a more substantial
effect on SBA-15 and Pd/SBA-15 than on PdMS.
The volume of nitrogen adsorbed in the heat-treated SBA-15 and Pd/SBA-15
(Figure 2a,c) diminishes
more significantly than in PdMS (Figure 2e), and a slight reduction in pore size is
observed by the shift in the hysteresis to lower-partial-pressure
range. Thermal annealing leads to less significant changes in the
surface area of PdMS compared to the reference SBA-15-based materials
(Table 1). This is
likely due to the retention of pore size as indicated in the pore
size distribution from BJH analysis (Figure 2b,d,f). However, the slope of the hysteresis
does not significantly change as a result of heat treatment, which
is an indication that the pore diameter (while decreasing in size)
does not become more irregular.45

d BJH desorption pore size: pore size
distribution analysis of mesopores (between 2 and 50 nm).

The micropore area of Pd/SBA-15
becomes completely negligible after
heat treatment (Table 1). Conversely, the intercalation of palladium into the SBA-15 framework
does not block micropore channels. The micropore size distribution
was also modeled using nonlocalized density functional theory (NLDFT)
with Micromeritics density functional theory (DFT) software package.
Although SBA-15 has more micropore volume than PdMS, the intercalation
of palladium into SBA-15 does increase the amount of sub-2 nm micropores
in the final PdMS nanocomposite catalyst (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

The N2 physisorption
experiments reveal that the heat
treatment influences the final pore structure and surface area of
the silica differently when Pd is present. PdMS experiences the smallest
decrease of BET surface area, microporosity, and BJH desorption pore
size (Figure 2 and Table 1) after heat treatment.
Thus, it appears that despite the presence of Pd within the support,
the mesoporous matrix is stable at high temperatures. Pd nanoparticles
do not block the main channels of the mesoporous silica, and the slight
reduction of surface area and pore size can be attributed to the contraction
of the mesoporous silica under high-temperature treatment.

X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed
to identify chemical speciation of surface Pd in PdMS and Pd/SBA-15
catalysts (Figure S3, Supporting Information).
Both PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 were first measured in their native (as-synthesized)
forms, i.e., PdMS was calcined at 550 °C in air and reduced at
150 °C in H2/N2 atmosphere. Pd/SBA-15 was
analyzed after synthesis, because Pd particles are formed in a reduced
state. PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 were then heated to 900 °C under nitrogen
and measured again after heat treatment.

The Pd 3d5/2 spectra were fit with components to deconvolute
metallic and oxidized Pd species (Figure S3 and Table S1, Supporting Information). The Pd 3d3/2 portion
was not fit due to high spectral noise. The native PdMS (Figure S3a, Supporting Information) was assigned
with four components: metallic Pd (335.0 eV), partially reduced palladium
oxide (PdO1–x) (336.0 eV), PdO
(337.2 eV), and PdCl2 (338.3 eV).46 The PdCl2 species, which is the Pd precursor used in
PdMS synthesis, is removed by high-temperature heating (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). The heat
treatment shifts the spectra to lower binding energy (BE) positions,
which overlap exactly with both the as-synthesized Pd/SBA-15 and heat-treated
Pd/SBA-15 (Figure 3c,d, Supporting Information):
metallic Pd (334.8 eV), PdO1–x (335.7
eV), and PdO (336.8 eV).

All samples were analyzed after being
stored under ambient conditions.
Thus, some surface oxidation of Pd is expected. However, the relative
atomic concentration of oxidized Pd species is much higher in PdMS,
while Pd/SBA-15 has more metallic Pd character (Table S1, Supporting Information). The difference in the speciation
between the two materials is hypothesized to stem from Pd particle
interaction with the SBA-15 support. For PdMS, the close proximity
of Pd particles with silica induces a Pd–O–Si interaction,
which increases the BE position of surface Pd. This type of ionicity
between Pd and SiO2 has been proposed previously.47−49 Upon heat treatment, the interaction with the support decreases
and shifts the surface Pd to a more reduced, metallic state (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). An analogous
effect is not observed in the Pd/SBA-15 reference. The surface Pd
is in a reduced state (334.8 eV) in the native and heat-treated Pd/SBA-15
catalysts (Figure S3c,d, Supporting Information).
No binding energy shift is observed because Pd particles are found
outside the SBA-15 framework, and there is less interaction with the
support.

2.2 Accessibility of Active Sites and Mechanism
of Phenol HDO over Pd
The distribution of Pd surface active
sites in PdMS and the Pd/SBA-15 reference was quantified using temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) (Figure 3). Materials were pretreated by oxidizing in air at 550 °C.
To avoid any reduction of Pd at room temperature, samples were cooled
after the oxidizing pretreatment, and TPR experiments were conducted
from 0 to 400 °C. PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 exhibit multiple reduction
events at temperatures below 100 °C, which is attributed to reduction
of Pd outside pores (62 °C) and reduction of Pd inside pores
(75 °C).50 PdMS has an additional
reduction event at 215 °C (Figure 3a), corresponding to Pd species, which have a strong
interaction with the SBA-15 support.51,52 This infers
that PdMS has a distribution of Pd sites both inside and outside the
SBA-15 framework. The hydrogen uptake was 0.15 and 0.10 mmol/g for
PdMS and Pd/SBA-15, respectively. The amount of catalyst used in subsequent
HDO reactions was normalized to the amount of accessible Pd.

PdMS and (b) Pd/SBA-15. Samples pretreated by oxidizing in air and
then heated at 10 °C/min in 10% H2/Ar atmosphere at
50 sccm flow rate.

The accessibility of
Pd active sites in PdMS to larger chemical
adsorbates was studied by the HDO of phenol. The deoxygenation of
phenol can proceed via two pathways: hydrogenation (HYD) and direct
deoxygenation (DDO) (Figure S4, Supporting
Information). The HDO of phenol over PdMS was tested in batch autoclaves
under varying initial hydrogen pressure (10, 20, and 30 bar) and temperature
(200, 300, and 350 °C), to elucidate potential differences in
the preferred reaction pathway or product selectivity under varying
reaction conditions (Table 2). It should be noted that the lower conversion at 300 °C
can be regarded as an experimental error. Considering the close to
complete conversion at both 200 and 350 °C, the result obtained
at 300 °C was not interpreted as a deviating trend.

d Ring balance: C-balance is given
relative to the C6-ring products.

In this study, it was found that high reaction temperatures
favor
the deoxygenation reaction, yielding cyclohexane as the main product.
The calculated thermodynamic equilibrium for the DDO of benzene and
HDO of phenol indicates that complete conversion of phenol can be
achieved up to at least 600 °C.53 Since
close to complete conversion was already achieved at 200 °C,
further effects of temperature increase on conversion could not be
measured. However, differences in selectivity are apparent in reactions
run at and below 350 °C. At temperatures below 350 °C, mostly
the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring takes place, yielding cyclohexanol
as the main product. Above 300 °C, the deoxygenation of cyclohexanol
to cyclohexane occurs with greater selectivity.

With a constant
temperature of 350 °C, the initial hydrogen
pressure has a strong influence on both conversion and product selectivity.
At low hydrogen pressure (10 bar), moderate phenol conversion (39%)
is observed with 18.3 and 30.6% selectivity of cyclohexanol and cyclohexane,
respectively. Conversion of phenol increases with 20 bar of hydrogen
pressure (87%) with a significant shift to more selective cyclohexane
formation (67.3%), which increases to 84.8% at 30 bar of hydrogen
pressure. This is in agreement with calculated thermodynamic equilibria,
which indicate that, assuming complete conversion of phenol, higher
hydrogen pressure shifts the equilibrium to deoxygenated products.53 Under all reaction conditions, benzene is only
a side product (<5%), inferring that phenol HDO over PdMS proceeds
via the expected HYD mechanism according to (i) phenol hydrogenation
to cyclohexanol, followed by (ii) a consecutive deoxygenation of cyclohexanol
to cyclohexene and hydrogenation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

2.3 Robustness and Regenerability of PdMS
The intercalation
of Pd into the SBA-15 framework is hypothesized
to make particles more robust and resistant to deactivation from particle
growth and loss of active surface area. Thermal in situ transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the stability of
the intercalated Pd particles against sintering (Figure 4). During the heating process,
Pd nanoparticles do not exhibit any visible morphological change up
to 900 °C, nor there is any particle migration observed within
the support. High-resolution imaging demonstrates that particles do
not significantly grow in size or sinter in PdMS after the completion
of the in situ heating experiment, which provides strong evidence
of Pd particles embedded in the walls of the SBA-15 support (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Particles
possess a narrow size distribution (4.5 ± 1.1 nm) even after
in situ heating due to confinement within pore walls of uniform width.
Moreover, the mesoporous structure does not collapse under high-temperature
annealing, which corroborates physisorption experiments. This infers
that intercalation of Pd into the walls of SBA-15 has a beneficial
effect on nanoparticle stability.

at (a) 25 °C, (b),
300 °C, (c) 600 °C, and (d) 900 °C.

The propensity for catalyst deactivation by formation
of coke was
also investigated by recycling PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 in successive HDO
reactions. Both materials were recycled in five phenol HDO reactions
at 350 °C and 30 bar of initial hydrogen pressure for 1 h, with
cyclohexene and cyclohexane being the favored products (Tables 3 and 4). After the first recycle, both catalysts lost about 45% of their
original activity. Interestingly, PdMS reached a fairly stable conversion
during recycle reactions 3–5 (41 ± 3%). In contrast, phenol
conversion over Pd/SBA-15 continued to decrease after every successive
recycling experiment, reaching only 30% conversion during the fifth
recycled reaction.

a Conditions: 10.5 mg of pelletized
PdMS catalyst, 5 mL of octane solvent, 3 mmol phenol, internal standard
(decane), 30 bar initial H2, 350 °C, and 1 h reaction
time. After the reaction, the catalyst was removed, washed with acetone,
and dried before reuse.

b Reactivation: After five runs, the
catalyst was reactivated by heating in air at 800 °C for 30 min.

Table 4 Recycling Experiments

a Conditions: 15.4 mg of pelletized
Pd/SBA-15 catalyst, 5 mL of octane solvent, 3 mmol phenol, internal
standard (decane), 30 bar initial H2, 350 °C, and
1 h reaction time. After the reaction, the catalyst was removed, washed
with acetone, and dried before reuse.

b Reactivation: After five runs, the
catalyst was reactivated by heating in air at 800 °C for 30 min.

The spent catalysts were analyzed
with thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) to quantify the amount of coke formed during the reaction and
determine a temperature at which to reactivate the catalysts (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The amounts
of mass loss as a result of coke removal in spent PdMS and Pd/SBA-15
catalysts were 16 and 14%, respectively. Although the amount of coke
formation between the catalysts is not significant, the larger amount
of coke formation seen in PdMS may be due to more Pd active sites
located in the framework of the SBA-15 support, rather than on the
external surface.

TGA of PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 indicated that a
reactivation temperature
of 800 °C in air would be sufficient to remove coke buildup from
the spent catalysts. Upon reactivation, the spent PdMS catalyst recovers
significantly, reaching 80% conversion compared to 43% after five
recycled uses. In strong contrast, Pd/SBA-15 could not be regenerated
as the conversion decreased further after reactivation treatment.
TEM was performed on both fresh and spent PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 catalysts
to examine the degree of Pd particle sintering as a result of recycling
and reactivation (Figure 5). The fresh PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 catalysts have average particle
size of 6 ± 2 nm and 10 ± 6 nm, respectively. After multiple
recycling experiments and reactivation, particle size in the spent
PdMS and Pd/SBA-15 catalysts increases to 7 ± 4 nm and 23 ±
22 nm, respectively. Substantial sintering is observed in the Pd/SBA-15
reference with a significant amount of aggregates larger than 40 nm
(Figure S7, Supporting Information). Palladium
particles intercalated into the SBA-15 framework resist sintering,
which is likely a contributing factor of the PdMS catalyst outperforming
Pd/SBA-15 in HDO of phenol.

3 Conclusions
Herein,
we demonstrate a simple, one-pot synthesis to intercalate
palladium nanoparticles into the framework of SBA-15-type mesoporous
silica (PdMS). The incorporation of Pd into SBA-15 confines particle
size to the width of the pore wall and does not impede the formation
of the mesoporous structure, yielding a high surface area material.
Despite the encapsulation of Pd inside the SBA-15 framework, metal
active sites remain accessible due to the high mesoporosity and microporosity
of the nanocomposite material. PdMS catalyzes the HDO of phenol over
the expected hydrogenation (HYD) route, producing a variety of fully
hydrogenated products. By varying reaction conditions, the selectivity
can be tuned to either cyclohexanol or cyclohexane. In situ and ex
situ microscopy, N2 physisorption, XPS, and TPR techniques
strongly infer that intercalated Pd nanoparticles produce interactions
with the SBA-15 support, which are different from those in the reference
Pd/SBA-15 material. Specifically, Pd becomes dramatically more stable
as exemplified by mitigation of particle growth and sintering in PdMS
upon heating to 900 °C. Despite loss of initial activity due
to coke formation in phenol HDO reactions, intercalated Pd can be
regenerated, regaining high conversion of phenol to cyclohexane. This
work is a positive step in designing mildly acidic, supported nanostructured
Pd catalysts that are regenerable and resistant to deactivation under
the harsh reaction conditions of batch system HDO. The intercalation
of Pd into the framework of SBA-15 mesoporous silica increases the
lifetime of nanostructured Pd catalysts, which can significantly reduce
material costs in the production of chemicals and fuels from biomass
sources.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst
Synthesis
4.1.1 Synthesis of PdMS
The metal palladium
nanoparticles intercalated into mesoporous silica were synthesized
by sol–gel chemistry in the presence of Pd and a metal-directing
agent. First, 2 g of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene
glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (Pluronic P-123,
Aldrich, Mn = 5800) was dissolved in 75
mL of 2 M HCl (Macron Fine Chemicals, Assay (HCl) 36.5–38.0%).
Subsequently, a mixture of 4 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (Aldrich,
≥99.0%) and 180 μL of bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]tetrasulfide
(TESPTS, Gelest Inc., 95.0%) was quickly added to the dissolved surfactant
with vigorous magnetic stirring. Then, 46 mg of anhydrous PdCl2 (Aldrich, 60% Pd) was dissolved in 2 M aqueous HCl and added
dropwise. The solution was stirred for 24 h at 35 °C and then
underwent a 72 h hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C. The solid
was filtered off and washed with nanopure water and ethanol three
times each. The product was dried in air for 24 h and calcined in
air at 550 °C for 5 h with a 5 °C/min heating rate. PdMS
was finally reduced under flowing H2/N2 atmosphere
(H2: 15 sccm, N2: 5 sccm) at 150 °C for
4 h. Pd loading of PdMS was calculated by ICP-OES to be 2.6 wt %.

4.1.2 Synthesis of Pd/SBA-15
For comparison,
Pd nanoparticles were also prepared via direct precipitation by modifying
a reported synthetic protocol.41 SBA-15
was first synthesized by a reported sol–gel method.44 Pd(OAc)2 (Aldrich, 98%) (20 mg) was
weighed into a 25 mL Schlenk flask. Under inert conditions, 30 mL
of anhydrous methanol (Mallinckrodt, 99.9%) was added to the flask.
Pd(OAc)2 was dissolved in methanol by stirring for 10 min
under N2 atmosphere. The flask was removed from the Schlenk
line, and 1 g of SBA-15 was added. The flask was reattached, and the
mixture stirred for an additional 10 min under vacuum. The flask was
then transferred to a rotovap, and the solvent was evaporated for
30 min to leave a damp paste. This paste was dried in air overnight.
The resulting gray powder is a surfactant-free Pd on SBA-15, which
we denote Pd/SBA-15. This method directly forms Pd particles without
the use of surfactants, which have sizes comparable to particles in
PdMS. Pd loading of Pd/SBA-15 was determined by ICP-OES to be 1.9
wt %.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
4.2.1 Physisorption
N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were performed using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 and 3 Flex
instruments. The samples (∼100 mg) were degassed at 90 °C
for 1 h and then at 350 °C for 8 h prior to the measurement.
The specific surface areas were calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method in the P/P0 range of 0.05–0.35. Mesopore size distribution curves were
determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method
from the desorption branch of the isotherm, and pore sizes were obtained
from the peak positions of the distribution curves. Micropore size
distribution curves were modeled using a nonlocalized density functional
theory (NLDFT) package from Micromeritics.

4.2.2 Temperature-Programmed
Reduction (TPR)
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments
were performed
with a Micromeritics 2920 instrument. The measurements were performed
in a quartz U-tube, in which approximately 50 mg of catalyst was supported
on a quartz wool plug. Samples were pretreated by oxidizing in air
at 550 °C for 5 h, followed by heating in argon to remove any
physisorbed oxygen. To avoid reduction of the palladium at room temperature,
the U-tube was cooled using a bath of dry ice and isopropanol. The
TPR was performed by flowing 50 sccm of a 10% H2/Ar gas
blend with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min from 0 to 400 °C.

4.2.3 In Situ Microscopy
For material
imaging, the final products were drop-cast on 300 mesh copper TEM
grids with holey carbon and were analyzed using an FEI Titan S/TEM
operated at 300 kV equipped with an in situ Hummingbird tantalum heating
stage. Total heating time was 110 min, and the sample was held at
each temperature under vacuum for either 15 min (300–800 °C)
or 20 min (900 °C).

4.2.4 Ex Situ Microscopy and
Particle Size Analysis
Ex situ TEM imaging was carried out
using a Hitachi HF-2000 operating
at 200 kV. All image analyses were conducted with ImageJ software.
Size distributions were determined from manual diameter measurement
of more than 100 particles per sample.

4.2.5 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
The samples were prepared
for XPS analysis by pressing the catalyst
powders onto double-sided tape on a multisample plate. XPS analysis
was performed on a Kratos Nova spectrometer. X-rays were supplied
by a monochromatic Al Kα source operated at 300 W. High-resolution
spectra were collected for carbon (C 1s), oxygen (O 1s), nitrogen
(N 1s), silicon (Si 2p), and palladium (Pd 3d) at an analyzer pass
energy of 20 eV. Data analysis was performed using CasaXPS software.
A linear background was applied to C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, and Si 2p. A
Shirley background was applied to the Pd 3d spectrum. The spectra
were calibrated by setting the C 1s peak maximum to 284.8 eV, which
is in accordance with reported XPS positions for adventitious carbon
on insulating surfaces (e.g., SiO2).54

4.2.6 Ex Situ Heating of PdMS
and Pd/SBA-15
Approximately 300 mg of catalyst was put into
a continuous flow
reactor. The volume was purged by flowing 20 sccm of N2 for 30 min. For physisorption and XPS experiments, the catalyst
was heated at 5 °C/min to 900 °C and held at that temperature
for 3 h under N2 flow (20 sccm). The catalysts were cooled
under flowing N2 to room temperature before being removed.

4.2.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
Approximately
4 mg of spent catalyst was placed in a small crucible.
TGA was conducted using a Netzsch STA 449 F3 Jupiter. The sample was
purged with air and heated at 10 K/min to 800 °C.

4.3 Catalytic Experiments
Prior to the
HDO reactions, catalysts were pelletized at 2.5 metric tons, crushed,
and sieved to 500/600 mesh. An amount of the pelletized catalyst was
added to a 45 mL steel autoclave, along with 5 mL of n-octane (Aldrich, 99%), 3 mmol phenol (Aldrich, 99.5%), and decane
(internal standard, gas chromatography (GC)). The autoclaves were
purged and pressurized with H2. The autoclave was equipped
with a mechanical stirrer, thermocoupler, and digital pressure transducer.
The autoclave was placed into a preheated heating mantle, and stirring
was initiated immediately. The mechanistic/selectivity study was conducted
with approximately 10 mg of PdMS per run. For recycling reactions,
the amount of catalyst used was determined by TPR experiments: 10.5
mg of PdMS and 15.4 mg of Pd/SBA-15. After reactions, the catalyst
was filtered and washed multiple times with acetone and dried before
the next use. The product solution was dried over sodium sulfate,
diluted in dichloromethane, and analyzed with GC and GC–MS.
Catalysts were reactivated by calcinations in air at 800 °C for
30 min. Additional information on calculating conversion, selectivity,
and ring balance can be found in the Supporting Information.
