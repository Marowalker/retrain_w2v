Here,
we study the influence of guanidinium (GUA) ions on the open-circuit
voltage (Voc) in the (GUA)x(MA)1–xPbI3 based perovskite solar cells. We demonstrate that incorporation
of GUA forms electronic and ionic accumulation regions at the interface
of the electron transporting layer and perovskite absorber layer.
Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results prove that the
formed accumulation region is associated with the enhanced surface
charge capacitance and photovoltage. Furthermore, we also demonstrate
the influence of the GUA ions on the enhanced interfacial and bulk
electronic properties due to more efficient charge transfer between
the bulk and interfaces and the reduced electronic defect energy levels.

Introduction
Over the last decade,
organometal halide perovskites have attracted
significant attention as promising materials for next-generation thin
film photovoltaic (PV) technology.1,2 The appealing
physicochemical properties of these compounds such as high carrier
mobility and diffusivity,3 low exciton
binding energy,4 tunable bandgap,5 long charge-carrier diffusion length,6 and tolerance to defects provide a broad application
horizon from perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to light emitting diodes
or lasers.7−9 Despite the great achievements in the efficiency
of the PSCs,10−14 the optoelectronic properties of these devices are mostly influenced
by the phenomena occurring at the interfaces between the perovskite
layer and either the electron transporting layer (ETL) or the hole
transporting layer (HTL).14,15 A recent report on
the surface recombination and collection efficiency in PSCs has demonstrated
that the nonradiative recombination at the interface (ETL/perovskite)
plays a crucial role in the Voc and charge
transfer phenomenon.16 The surface and
bulk recombinations in the framework of Shockley Read Hall can occur
in two fractions: (i) a doped semiconductor, in which the doped material
undergoes rapid recombination due to the presence of excess carriers
and (ii) an intrinsic semiconductor, in which the recombination is
delayed, and this could be certainly beneficial for achieving higher
photovoltage.17 Small perturbation techniques,
such as intensity-modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy
(IMPS and IMVS), and frequency domain measurements are able to efficiently
extract the dynamic operating parameters of solar cells. These characterization
tools have been widely employed for evaluation of different photovoltaic
devices.18,19 However, despite their great potential,
only a few reports demonstrated the applications of these techniques
in the PSCs.20−23

Recently, guanidinium (C(NH2)3+) has been regarded as an attractive candidate for fabrication of
efficient and stable PSCs.24−28 Remarkably, we demonstrated that the guanidinium (GUA) cation, despite
its large size, can replace methylammonium (MA) at the A site of ABX3 perovskite and form a pure phase of GUAxMA1–xPbI3-type
perovskite.29 The resulting GUA-based PSCs
show potential to increase the charge-carrier lifetime and Voc of the PSCs compared to the pristine MAPbI3 based devices. However, the origin of such improvements and
the charge dynamic mechanism have not been widely investigated.

In this work, we investigate the role of GUA in charge carrier
and recombination dynamics in fully working (GUA)x(MA)1–xPbI3-type PSCs. Our analysis using small perturbation techniques reveals
that the incorporation of GUA causes electrode polarization at the
interface, which could be responsible for the prominent hysteresis
in GUA-based PSCs. The IMPS response permits the quantization of the
charge transport phenomena, which affects the photogenerated charge
collection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the incorporation of
GUA causes excess electronic charge accumulation at the interface,
which is responsible for the observed enhancement in photovoltage.
These results provide a pathway to achieve efficient solar cells along
with an in-depth working mechanism.

Results and Discussion
To study the effect of GUA on the photovoltaic (PV) properties
of the PSCs as also reported in the literature,29 we fabricated a batch of solar cells with the following
architecture: FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (more details can be found in the Experimental Section). Figure 1a shows the current density–voltage
(J–V) characteristics of the best performing
(GUA)x(MA)1–xPbI3 PSCs (where x = 0, 0.10, and
0.25) measured under reverse bias and Air Mass 1.5G (AM1.5G) (the
statistic histogram of PV parameters are shown in Figure S1). We found that the replacement of 10 mol % MA with
GUA increases the Voc and Jsc over 30 mV and 1.2 mA cm–2, respectively.
As a result, the PCE of the prepared devices increases from 17.5 ±
0.5% for MAPbI3 to 18.0 ± 0.5% for (GUA)0.1(MA)0.9PbI3 PSCs. However, incorporation of
25 mol % GUA reduces the PCE to 16.0 ± 0.5% due to a decrease
in the FF and Jsc. These data are consistent
with our previous work,29 where the introduction
of a small amount of GUA into the perovskite composition increased
the Voc and PCE. The MAPbI3 and (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSCs
with a PCE of 17.5 ± 0.5% were employed to study the role of
GUA in the hysteresis effect and charge carrier and recombination
dynamics.

and (GUA)0.25(MA)0.75PbI3 devices.

Hysteresis Effect
Figure S2 shows
the hysteresis curves of the MAPbI3 (reference)
and (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSCs. We
used the following formula to calculate hysteresis indices (HIs) of
the PSCs30  From the J–V result,
the HI was calculated to be 18.5% for the reference device and 16.8%
for the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSC.
Despite the favorable properties of GUA cations such as zero dipole
moment and hydrogen bonding capability, the hysteresis is more prominent
in GUA-based devices. To rationalize the observed hysteresis feature,
we measured the capacitance–frequency (C–f) responses at zero bias under dark conditions (Figure 1b). The distinct features in
the low and high frequencies of the C–f response
are clearly distinguishable.30 A constant
capacitance element in frequency >103 Hz for the reference
and (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 is associated
with the dielectric response of the absorber material, while the capacitance
in the low-frequency region has originated from the ionic characteristics.31−34 It is clear that due to the presence of GUA cations in the perovskite,
which have a larger size (278 pm) and weaker bonding ability than
MA cations, GUA cations can pile up near the interfaces and distribute
the local electric field, leading to a higher capacitance in the low-frequency
range.28 By assuming only the electrostatic
interaction at room temperature, the space charge densities of 6.04
× 1017 and 1.1 × 1018 and were obtained
for the reference and (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSCs, respectively. The accumulation of excess GUA ions in
the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSCs increases
the capacitance in the low-frequency region and leads to the current
hysteresis. Moreover, the ion movement under the applied bias amplifies
the hysteresis by screening the internal electric field at the interface
between TiO2 and perovskite.

Charge Transport and Time
Responses
To elucidate the
influence of GUA on the transport properties of the PSCs, the intensity-modulated
photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) under constant light intensity was
performed (Figure 2). The IMPS response for both PSCs shows distinguishable characteristics
in the low and high frequency regions and exhibits different time
constants. We analyzed the frequency arcs according to the established
transport mechanism for the TiO2/perovskite interface,
TiO2 ETL, and the perovskite layer.35,36 The slow response time in the low-frequency region is dominated
by the transport process in the TiO2 or TiO2/perovskite interface, while the higher frequency of the arc from
1 to 10 Hz (faster transport) is ascribed to the perovskite layer.
The low-frequency component (800 mHz to 1 Hz) of MAPbI3 perovskite corresponds to the time constant of 0.031–1 s.
However, the low-frequency component of the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 device slightly shifts toward a higher
frequency, which corresponds to the lower time constant, suggesting
the modification in the interfacial electrical response. To have a
better understanding of this phenomenon, we further examined the device
with a higher amount of GUA (25%). As expected, the low-frequency
component in the (GUA)0.25(MA)0.75PbI3 device shifts toward a higher frequency as compared to the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 device. In contrast,
the high frequency responses (shorter time constant) centered at 7
Hz are almost similar in all of the investigated PSCs. The diffusion
coefficient Dn = d2/2.35τn,
where Dn is the diffusion
parameter, d is the thickness of the perovskite absorber
layer, and τn represents the time
constant, are calculated to be 1.23 × 10–8 and
2.83 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 for the reference and (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSCs, respectively. The charge transport at the TiO2/perovskite interface can also be visualized by the current transient
measurements near the short circuit condition as shown in Figure S3. The shorter decay time in the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 device confirms the
faster charge transport at the TiO2/perovskite interface
as compared to the reference device. From the IMPS and transient responses,
we conclude that the GUA cations improve the charge transport and
diffusion coefficient.

Figure 2 Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) under
constant
light intensity for MAPbI3, (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3, and (GUA)0.25(MA)0.75PbI3 PSCs.

The pXRD patterns of
(GUA)x(MA)1–xPbI3 films (where x = 0, 0.10,
and 0.25) are shown in Figure S4, which
are in good agreement with previous reports.25,29Figure S5a shows the UV–visible
spectra of the perovskite films with different amounts of GUA cations.
As seen, the perovskite film with 10% mol GUA has better absorption
than the reference sample. Also, the photoluminescence (PL) emission
of this sample is much stronger than the others (see Figure S5b). The observed better optical properties of (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 perovskite together
with the improved charge transfer properties could be the main reasons
for the improved current density in these PSCs. Additionally, we study
the morphology of the corresponding perovskite films using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques,
as shown in Figures S6 and S7. From the
SEM images, the GUA-based perovskite films have different morphology
with slightly lower grain sizes compared to pure MAPbI3. As mentioned in the literature,25 the
GUA-based perovskites have large crystal domains containing small
grain sizes, which can affect the optoelectronic properties of the
perovskite films. In fact, the AFM results show similar morphology
and grain size to the SEM images. We found that the surface roughness
of the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 perovskite
film (21 ± 6 nm) is lower than that of the pure MAPbI3 sample (34 ± 9 nm). This result indicates that the GUA-based
perovskite has a smoother contact than the reference sample with the
HTL, suggesting better charge transfer at this interface with possibly
lower recombination.37,38

To gain insight into the
band diagram of the GUA-based perovskite,
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was performed
(Figure S8). The extracted data from the
UPS curves are summarized in Table S2.
Based on these values, we draw the band diagram of the perovskite
films, as shown in Figure S8c. We found
that by introduction of GUA cations into the perovskite composition,
the energy levels of both valence and conduction bands become deeper
and upon increasing the amount of GUA, the energy levels are further
enhanced. We observed this enhancement for the Fermi level as well.
Interestingly, these results indicate that addition of the GUA cations
makes the perovskite film more p-type. This could help for a better
charge transfer between the perovskite and TiO2 ETL, due
to the presence of a stronger electrical field at the interface and
also a closer conduction band of GUA-based perovskites to that of
the TiO2 ETL.38 However, if
we look at the interface between the perovskite and spiro HTL, it
is clear that pure MAPbI3 perovskite shows better charge
transfer (hole) with respect to the spiro HTL, due to its closer valence
band to that of the HTL. Notably, by increasing the amount of GUA
to 25 mol %, the valence band of the perovskite film increases to
5.5 eV, which is much deeper than that of the spiro HTL, resulting
in more difficult hole transfer and thus more interfacial recombination.

Charge Accumulation and Time Responses
The effect of
GUA on the interfacial electronic charge accumulation properties were
further studied by measuring the capacitance versus frequency response
under illumination at different applied biases from knee voltages
to the VOC of the PSCs. The C–f plot, shown in Figure 3, demonstrates that the capacitive element
due to the surface charge accumulation (CS) dominates at low frequency (∼1 Hz) and the capacitance due
to the dielectric response of the perovskite thin film (Cg) predominates at high frequency (>103 Hz).
The low-frequency C–f plot
(Figure 1b), assigned
to the accumulation of ions and ionic space charge capacitance, exhibits
values in the order of microfarad, which substantially increases to
millifarad under illumination conditions, indicating that the interfacial
capacitance is changed by the electronic phenomena (Figure 3).6,16,17 However, as the ionic capacitance under
open-circuit conditions is limited by the Helmholtz capacitance, a
higher value of CS is obtained for (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 as compared to that
of the MAPbI3 device. On the contrary, the Cg value remains unchanged under illumination for both
PSCs and is attributed to the dielectric characteristics of the perovskite
film. This mechanism shows that the electronic accumulation is kinetically
controlled by GUA ionic species. The buildup of electronic accumulation
capacitance at the TiO2/perovskite interface follows the
exponential voltage dependence by Cs =
εε0/√2LD exp(qV/2kBT), where  is the Debye length and q and kBT are the elementary
charge and thermal energy, respectively.31,32,39

as a function of applied bias (the arrow indicates the increase in
applied bias) under illumination for (a) MAPbI3 and (b)
(GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 devices.

Recently, it was reported that a part of Voc in the PSCs has originated from the charge
accumulation,
while the other part of Voc has originated
from band bending.40,41 In the case of the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSC, ion accumulation
causes the formation of an accumulation zone, where upon illumination
and under open-circuit conditions, photogenerated charges get accommodated
and forms the photovoltage.

To investigate the time response
associated with the charge accumulation
and dielectric phenomenon of the corresponding PSCs, the intensity-modulated
photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS)-derived time constant as a function
of Voc was recorded for both PSCs and
is shown in Figure 4a. One can easily calculate the time response by the inverse of frequency
in the low and high frequency spectra of IMVS. The high frequency
peak, assigned to the dielectric capacitance of the absorber layer,
provides information about the carrier lifetime. The reference device
exhibits a carrier lifetime of ∼4–5 μs, whereas
the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 sample
shows an enhanced charge-carrier lifetime of ∼6–7.5
μs, attributing to the lower charge recombination, which is
in good agreement with the previous report.24 In line with a similar effect observed by the other authors,24,25 where the GUA enhanced the carrier lifetime and Voc of the PSCs,24,25 the present study indicates
that along with the enhanced carrier lifetime, the higher electronic
accumulation at the interface also significantly contributes to the Voc.

photovoltage
spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements at the open-circuit voltage for MAPbI3, (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3,
and (GUA)0.25(MA)0.75PbI3 and (b)
trap densities obtained from thermal admittance spectroscopy for MAPbI3 and (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 devices.

To further understand the influence
of GUA on the defect-state
energy level of the perovskite films, the defect energy level and
defect density of MAPbI3 and (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSCs were investigated using thermal admittance
spectroscopy (TAS), as shown in Figure 4b. TAS is a well-established technique to probe both
shallow and deep defect energy levels with defect density on thin
films.42−44 The defect energy level is calculated by using the
expression, ω0 = βT2 exp(−Ea/kBT), where Ea is the defect activation energy level and ω0 is
the characteristic transition frequency related to the rate of carrier
emission and capture in the defect states. The Ea of the reference device is calculated as 0.40 eV, while a
significantly lower Ea of 0.22 eV was
obtained for the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSC. The obtained defect energy levels are in accordance with the
commonly quoted values in the literature and are potentially ascribed
to iodine interstitials.43,44 The trap densities
corresponding to the obtained Ea can be
calculated by using the expression of Nt = (Vbi/qW)(dC/dω)(ω/kBT), where Vbi is built in potential, W is the depletion width, dC/dω is
the derivative of capacitance with respect to the angular frequency.
By considering the Gaussian distribution, the defect states are centered
at 0.40 eV for the reference and at 0.22 eV for the (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSCs. Moreover, an integrated
defect density of ∼1016 cm–3 was
obtained for both PSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
investigated the role of GUA in the charge
carrier and recombination dynamics and their associated time responses
in the (GUA)x(MA)1–xPbI3 PSCs. From the IMPS analysis and
transient responses, we demonstrated that the addition of GUA improves
the charge transport and diffusion coefficient. Lower charge recombination
times of ∼4–5 and ∼6–7.5 μs for
MAPbI3 and (GUA)0.10(MA)0.90PbI3 PSCs, respectively, were observed. We found that along with
the enhanced carrier lifetime, the higher electronic accumulation
at the interfaces also significantly contributes to the Voc enhancement. In fact, the incorporation of GUA into
the perovskite leads to an improved interfacial and bulk electronic
properties due to better charge transport across the bulk and interface
and lower electronic defect at energy levels.

Experimental Section
Materials
Guanidinium hydroiodide (TCI, 99.95%), methylammonium
iodide (DyeSol), PbI2 (TCI, 99.99%), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, 99.9%), chlorobenzene (95%), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (99.9%),
4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%), and lithium
bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (Sigma-Aldrich, Li-TFSI, 95%) were
used. The TiO2 paste (18 NRD) was purchased from Dyesol.

Solar Cell Device Fabrication
PSCs were fabricated
according to our previously published paper.23 Briefly, GUA·HI, MA·HI, and PbI2 precursors
were dissolved in anhydrous DMSO (in corresponding molar ratios) at
60 °C together with vigorous stirring overnight to achieve GUAxMA1–xPbI3 solutions (x = 0, 0.10, and 0.25) with 1.4
M. Then, a two-step program was employed to deposit perovskite solutions,
i.e., spin coating at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively.
To form perovskite, the antisolvent technique was used, and 10 s before
the end of spinning, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the
substrates. Finally, the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for
30 min in a dry air box. For the HTL, a solution of spiro-MeOTAD was
prepared by mixing the following precursors: 74 mg of spiro-MeOTAD
dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, 17.5 μL of a solution of
lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) dissolved in
acetonitrile (520 mg·mL–1), 29 μL of
a solution of tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)
bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (FK 209) dissolved in acetonitrile
(300 mg·mL–1), and 28.8 μL of tert-butylpyridine. Afterward, the HTL solution was spin-coated
on the perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, the fabrication
of the devices was completed by thermal evaporation of 80 nm-thick
gold under high vacuum.

Film Characterization
PXRD diffractograms
were recorded
on an X’Pert MPD PRO (Panalytical) diffractometer (Cu anode,
λ = 1.54 060 A°) in an angle range of 2θ =
5–40° with a step of 0.02 degree. UV–vis spectra
were recorded by a Varian Cary 5 and PL spectra using Fluorolog 322
(Horiba Jobin Ybon Ltd.). The morphology and smoothness of the films
were studied using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (ZEISS
Merlin) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, NanoScope IIIa/Dimension
3100), respectively. UPS was employed to record the valence and Fermi
levels of perovskite films using He I (21.2 eV) by AXIS NOVA (Kratos
Analytical Ltd., U.K.).

Device Characterization
To measure
the J–V curves, a light source (a 450 W Xenon
lamp, Oriel) with an intensity
of 100 mW cm–2 and a sunlight filter (Schott K113
Tempax, Praezisions Glas & Optik GmbH) were employed. The purpose
of using a filter was to adjust the measurement according to the AM1.5G
standard condition. J–V measurements were
obtained by a Keithley (Model 2400) digital source meter upon applying
external bias to the devices. A shadow mask with a black color was
used to define the active area, which was 0.16 cm2 in our
cases. To perform the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization,
a Bio-Logic SP-300 potentiostat together with a frequency response
analyzer was used. For impedance measurement, the direct current (DC)
bias range was varied from 0 to open-circuit voltage and the alternating
current perturbation signal was set to 10 mV. The frequency was changed
from 1 Hz to 100 kHz to monitor the device behavior. For IMVS and
IMPS measurements, a Bio-Logic SP-300 potentiostat together with a
frequency response analyzer was employed and 10% of the DC background
illumination intensity was set for modulation current. The galvanostatic
mode of Bio-Logic SP-300 with a cool white-light-emitting diode array
(12 V, 10 W) as the light source was employed here.
