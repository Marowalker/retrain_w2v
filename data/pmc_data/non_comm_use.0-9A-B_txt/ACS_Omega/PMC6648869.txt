Emerging
flexible and wearable electronic devices necessitates
the development of fiber-type energy storage devices to power them.
Supercapacitors received great attention for applications in flexible
and wearable devices due to their scalability, safety, and miniature
size. Herein, we report the fabrication of a flexible supercapacitor
using manganese(II,III) oxide (Mn3O4) nanowalls
(NWs) grown by electrochemical deposition on carbon fiber (CF) as
electrode-active material. Here, CF serves as both a substrate for
the growth of Mn3O4 NWs and a current collector
for making a lightweight supercapacitor. Two-dimensional Mn3O4 NWs were uniformly grown on CF with high surface coverage.
A three-dimensional nanostructured electrode is obtained using these
individual two-dimensional Mn3O4 NWs. The Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF are characterized by scanning
electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
and Raman spectroscopy. A symmetric sandwich-type supercapacitor is
fabricated using two-dimensional Mn3O4 NW electrodes
in an aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrode exhibits a specific
capacitance of 300.7 F g–1 at a scan rate of 5 mV
s–1. The assembled symmetric sandwich-type supercapacitor
displayed high flexibility even at a bending angle of 180° without
altering its performance. The Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor
also displayed a long cycle life of 7500 cycles with 100% capacitance
retention.

Introduction
As a result of the
recent advancements in the field of flexible
and wearable electronic devices, flexible energy storage devices are
attracting considerable attention.1−6 The existing energy storage devices like Li-ion batteries are less
attractive for these applications due to limitations like safety,
bulkiness, nonflexibility, and excessive weight.7−9 On the other
hand, electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors emerged as an
alternative for these applications.10−12 Supercapacitors utilizing
flexible electrodes have received high demand in the scientific community
due to their feasible incorporation in the flexible electronic devices.13,14 Not only the electrodes but also the current collector substrates
should be flexible to achieve the total flexibility. A prerequisite
for a good supercapacitor for flexible application is that the performance
of the supercapacitor should not be altered at severe bending and
twisting conditions.15−17 Nevertheless, the low energy density of supercapacitors
is still a roadblock in many applications.

Carbon nanomaterials
such as activated carbons, graphene, carbon
nanotube (CNT), etc. have been widely used as electrode materials
in supercapacitors.18−21 Carbon nanomaterial-based supercapacitors exhibit high power densities,
but the low specific capacitance and energy density remain as significant
challenges.22 Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials
are explored as supercapacitor electrodes due to their large surface
area and excellent electrochemical performance.23 Examples for 2D nanomaterials used as electrode materials
in supercapacitors are graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides,
MXenes, and phosphorene. Graphene, a single sheet of carbon with 2D
nanostructure, has attracted attention in the past decade.24,25 Transition-metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2, MoSe2, VS2, WS2, etc. attracted attention
in the supercapacitor research due to their unique properties such
as large surface area, variable oxidation states, etc.23,26,27 MXenes are emerging materials
for supercapacitor application due to their intrinsic electronic conductivity,
hydrophilic nature, and good mechanical properties.28,29 Phosphorene is the most recently explored material for supercapacitor
applications.30 But all of these 2D materials
are costly due to various reasons such as high production cost, sophisticated
machinery required for the processing, availability of precursor materials,
etc.

To solve the low specific capacitance and high-cost issues
associated
with carbon supercapacitors, transition-metal oxides (TMOs) have been
evolved. TMO-based supercapacitors exhibit high specific capacitance
and comparatively high energy density compared to carbon supercapacitors.
TMOs such as manganese oxide, ruthenium oxide, and vanadium oxide
have exhibited high specific capacitance and provided high energy
density.31−34 Among the TMOs, manganese oxide has achieved much attention due
to its natural abundance, high specific capacitance, and low cost.
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) and manganese(II,III) oxide (Mn3O4) are two manganese oxides with different oxidation
states used as electrodes in supercapacitor applications. MnO2 is a well-studied electrode material, whereas Mn3O4 is scarcely studied for supercapacitor electrode applications.35−39 Various Mn3O4 morphologies such as nanoparticles,
nanofibers, and nanocrystals are invariably used for obtaining high
specific capacitance in supercapacitors.40−42 Recently developed
chromium-doped Mn3O4 nanocrystal-based supercapacitor
electrodes exhibited a capacitance of 272 F g–1 in
a three-electrode cell configuration at a current density of 0.5 A
g–1 in aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.42 Hausmannite Mn3O4 thin
film-based supercapacitor electrodes made by electrochemical deposition
procedure exhibited an electrode specific capacitance of 210 F g–1 in aqueous 3 M Na2SO4 electrolyte
at a current density of 0.5 A g–1 and ∼70%
capacitance retention after 4000 charge–discharge cycles.43 Mn3O4 nanorods/nickel
foam composite electrodes were synthesized via a hydrothermal method
and used as cathode material in a supercapacitor, which displayed
an electrode specific capacitance of 263 F g–1 at
a current density of 1 A g–1 in 4 M NaOH electrolyte.44 In another report, single-crystalline Mn3O4 nano-octahedrons prepared via hydrothermal method
were used as supercapacitor electrodes, and they achieved electrode
specific capacitances of 195 and 244 F g–1 at scan
rates of 100 and 50 mV s–1, respectively, in 1 M
Na2SO4 electrolyte.45

Carbon fiber (CF)-based electrodes have attracted much interest
in the fabrication of flexible supercapacitors, as they can easily
be incorporated with the wearable fabrics due to their bendable and
flexible nature.46−48 In addition to their flexible nature, they exhibit
good electronic conductivity, high mechanical strength, excellent
chemical and electrochemical stabilities, and lightweight.49−52 They are used as either a substrate for depositing electrode-active
material to synthesize supercapacitor electrodes or current collectors
for supercapacitors. The unique features of CFs mentioned above help
in obtaining high-flexibility and lightweight supercapacitors. Herein,
we report the fabrication of flexible supercapacitor electrodes consisting
of Mn3O4 nanowalls (NWs). We grew Mn3O4 NWs on CF by the electrochemical deposition procedure
and used as electrode-cum-current collectors for fabricating a flexible
supercapacitor. Two-dimensional individual Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF enabled the electrodes to obtain a hierarchical
three-dimensional porous structure. Since no additional current collectors
and polymeric binders are used in this study, the as-fabricated supercapacitor
electrodes, as well as the supercapacitor cell, are lightweight.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a,b shows
the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF substrate. The Mn3O4 NWs are grown with high density on the CF substrate. Figure 1c,d shows the high-resolution
SEM images of Mn3O4 NWs, and it is clear that
the NWs comprise a porous architecture. This porous structure of the
Mn3O4 NWs enhances the faradic reactions between
the electrode-active material and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing
the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor. It can be seen that
the surface coverage of Mn3O4 NWs is very high
and the second layer of NWs is grown on top of the first layer of
NWs while maintaining the porous architecture. Energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy analysis (EDAX) was used to determine the distribution
of Mn3O4 NWs on the CF substrate. Figure S1 shows the EDAX mapping images as well
as the EDAX spectra of Mn3O4 NWs grown on the
CF substrate. The EDAX mapping is carried out for the elements carbon,
nitrogen, manganese, and oxygen. The presence of carbon and nitrogen
arises from the CF substrate, which is highly nitrogen-rich. The EDAX
mapping images clearly show that the Mn3O4 NWs
are distributed uniformly in the CF substrate over the entire region.
The uniform growth of two-dimensional NWs on CF can also be viewed
from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, as shown in Figure 2a. The two-dimensional
porous architectures of supercapacitor electrodes are much preferred
for obtaining high specific capacitance and energy density. Due to
the porous architecture of the electrodes, more electrolyte ions can
penetrate through it, which enhances the redox performance of the
Mn3O4 NW electrodes. The three-dimensional topographical
AFM image shown in Figure 2b represents the vertical growth of Mn3O4 NWs on the CF substrate. The electrochemical deposition procedure
is a versatile method to prepare nanostructured electrodes, where
a uniform growth can be achieved.

on CF at different magnifications (scale bars: (a) 20 μm, (b)
2 μm, (c) 200 nm, and (d) 200 nm).

of the Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF.

To understand the structure of two-dimensional
Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF, X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis is carried
out. Figure 3 represents
the XRD spectrum of the Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF.
A broad peak positioned at 20–30° represents the amorphous
nature of the CF. The CF is used as received, and no surface treatment
is performed prior to use. The other peaks belong to the amorphous
Mn3O4 phase (JCPDF no. 3-1041).53 From the XRD analysis, it is clear that the as-synthesized
Mn3O4 NWs are amorphous. Raman spectroscopy
is a versatile tool used in determining the structure of nanomaterials. Figure 4 shows the signature
Raman spectrum of the as-synthesized Mn3O4 NWs
on CF. Two major peaks associated with CF can be observed, one positioned
at ∼1384 cm–1 and the other at ∼1602
cm–1. The peak at ∼1384 cm–1 is associated with the disordered carbon, and the one at ∼1602
cm–1 represents the graphitic carbon.54 Two minor peaks are located at ∼309 and
∼385 cm–1 and a dominant peak at ∼669
cm–1. They are attributed to the specific vibrations
of pure Mn3O4.55−57 From the XRD and Raman
spectroscopic analyses, the formation of Mn3O4 phase is confirmed.

To understand the electrochemical
properties of the Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) measurement have been carried out in a three-electrode cell
configuration. Figure 5a shows the Nyquist plots obtained for the Mn3O4 NW electrode within a frequency range of 106–0.1
Hz, and the inset shows the high-frequency region. It shows that the
Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrode displays an
electrochemical series resistance (ESR) of 300 mΩ. Figure 5b represents the
CV curves obtained at different scan rates of 100, 50, 25, 10, and
5 mV s–1. The near-rectangular nature of the CV
curves with a large area under the curve represents that the Mn3O4 NW electrodes exhibited good charge storage
capabilities. Due to the two-dimensional NW architecture, the effective
surface area of the supercapacitor electrodes has increased, which
in turn stimulated the pseudocapacitive charge storage by the Mn3O4-active material. Figure 5c shows the GCD curves of the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrodes, which indicate the typical
nature of the charge–discharge process of a supercapacitor
with fast charging and discharging capabilities.

in the frequency range of 106–0.1 Hz (inset: Nyquist
plot in the high-frequency region),
(b) CV curves at different scan rates, and (c) GCD curves at different
current densities for Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor
electrodes in aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.

Figure 6a represents
the gravimetric capacitance obtained for the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrodes at different scan rates. The supercapacitor
electrode exhibited a high gravimetric capacitance of 300.7 F g–1 at 5 mV s–1. The enhanced performance
is attributed to the hierarchical porous electrode nanostructures
associated with the Mn3O4 NWs, in which more
number of electrolyte ions can be moved inside the porous architecture,
thereby resulting in an enhanced faradic reaction. The supercapacitor
electrode displayed a high area specific capacitance of 571 mF cm–2 at 5 mV s–1, and the variation
in the areal capacitance with respect to the scan rate is shown in Figure 6b. Supercapacitors
with high areal capacitance are greatly preferred for integrating
them with flexible and thin wearable electronic devices. Hence, the
present Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrodes are
potential candidates for flexible and wearable applications. As shown
in Figure 6c, a gravimetric
energy density of 41.7 Wh kg–1 is obtained for the
Mn3O4 NW electrodes, which is higher than those
of the other Mn3O4 supercapacitors in the literature.41,58,59 But the present Mn3O4 supercapacitor electrodes exhibit attractive features
such as safety, environment friendliness, and flexibility. An areal
specific energy density of 79.4 mWh cm–2 at 5 mV
s–1 is obtained for Mn3O4 NW
supercapacitor electrodes, and the variation in the areal specific
energy density of the supercapacitor electrode is depicted in Figure 6d. A comparison of
the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrodes with
the existing flexible/wearable manganese oxide-based supercapacitors
in the literature is given in Table S1.
To examine the electrochemical cycling stability of the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrode, CV measurement has been
carried out in a three-electrode cell configuration for 3000
cycles. The capacitance of the electrode is found to be increased during
the initial cycles due to the activation process and found to
maintain a 100% retention until 3000 cycles, as shown in Figure S2. A capacitance retention of 100% after
3000 cycles clearly shows the good electrochemical stability of the
Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrode. It is of
great interest to examine the microstructure of the supercapacitor
electrode after the cycling test, and Figure S3 shows the field emission SEM image of the electrode after completion
of 3000 continuous cycles. From the SEM image, it is clear that the
porous electrode nanostructure is unaltered after the cycling test,
which is the reason behind excellent capacitance retention even after
completion of 3000 continuous cycles. Some of the pores are looking
hazy, mainly due to the solidification of electrolyte after the cycling
just before the SEM analysis.

capacitance (in mF
cm–2), (c) gravimetric energy density (Wh kg–1), and (d) areal energy density (in mWh cm–2) for Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor electrode in
aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.

The Nyquist plot of the Mn3O4 NW electrode-based
symmetric supercapacitor cell is shown in Figure 7a. The inset of the figure shows the Nyquist
plot in high-frequency regions, and the ESR of the supercapacitor
cell is calculated to be 1.19 Ω. This ESR value is high, as
it is obvious that in an assembled supercapacitor cell, the ESR increases. Figure 7b shows the CV curves
obtained at various scan rates. The near-rectangular nature of the
curves shows that the supercapacitor exhibits good charge storage
capability. Figure 7c represents the GCD curves of the Mn3O4 NW
supercapacitor at different current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3
mA cm–2. The symmetric charge–discharge curves
indicate that the present supercapacitor exhibits good Coulombic efficiency.
The flexibility of the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor
is examined by performing the CV studies at different bending angles
of 0 (straight position), 30, 60, 90, and 180° (Figure 7d). It can be seen from the
figure that even at a severe bending angle of 180°, the capacitance
of the supercapacitor is retained almost at 90% of its initial value.
The inset of Figure 7d shows the digital images of the supercapacitor bend at an angle
of 180°, twisted on a finger, and weaved on a textile fabric
glove, which shows that the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor
is highly bendable, twistable, and capable of incorporating with the
daily wearable textiles. The cycle life of the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor is estimated by performing CV study for
continuous 7500 cycles at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s–1. Figure 7e represents
the capacitance retention at different cycles of the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor. A repetitive increase and decrease
in the capacitance can be observed from the plot, which is obvious
for supercapacitors and associated with the ion diffusion mechanisms
through the supercapacitor electrode nanostructures.15 Initially, an increase in the capacitance (an increase
of 33.4% capacitance retention) was observed after 2700 cycles followed
by a slow decrease to about 105%. The repetitive increase and decrease
are associated with the ion diffusion mechanisms through the hierarchical
three-dimensional porous network of Mn3O4 NWs.
It is proposed that during the initial cycles, additional pores might
have opened as a result of electrolyte diffusion toward the inner
parts of the porous three-dimensional network of Mn3O4 NW electrodes. This enhances the faradic reactions, and hence
an increase in capacitance is expected. As the cycling proceeds, a
degradation of the electrode nanostructure may happen, which in turn
deteriorates its performance, and hence a decrease in the capacitance
is observed. Even after 7500 cycles, the Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor displayed a capacitance retention of 105%, a 5%
enhancement from its first cycle, indicating its potential application
for prolonged usage in various applications. Room-temperature ionic
liquids are also potential electrolyte candidates to obtain high specific
capacitance and energy density, but their high cost limits their use
in commercial applications.60−63 A Ragone plot comparing the energy density and power
density of Mn3O4 supercapacitor electrodes with
other supercapacitor electrodes in the literature is depicted in Figure S4. The energy density of the Mn3O4 supercapacitor electrodes is higher than that of many
of the supercapacitor electrodes such as Mn3O4 nanofibers,64 ZnO/activated carbon nanofiber
composite,65 Mn3O4 nanosheets,59 ZnO/CNT nanocomposite,66 Mn3O4/graphene composite,67 etc.

of the Mn3O4 supercapacitor, and (f) lighting

While using the liquid electrolytes,
electrolyte leakage may happen
if appropriate sealing procedures are not adopted, which is not acceptable
for wearable applications. In our present study, we used sophisticated
sealing procedures during the fabrication of the supercapacitor to
prevent the possible leaking. Moreover, we use water-based electrolytes
to be safe for wearable applications. Leak-proof supercapacitors can
also be developed by using polymer gel electrolytes.68−70 But the electrochemical performance will be lower than the liquid
electrolyte-based supercapacitors due to higher ESR of the polymer
electrolyte system. To demonstrate the practical application of the
Mn3O4 NW supercapacitor, we have fabricated
a supercapacitor stack consisting of two symmetric supercapacitors
and lighted up a green light-emitting diode (LED). Two identical Mn3O4 NW symmetric supercapacitor cells were fabricated
as discussed before using aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte and connected in series. The supercapacitor stack is
charged to 2.2 V for a minute and then discharged through an LED (color:
Super L. Green, Vf@20 mA = 2 V, radiant
power = 3 mW@20 mA), as shown in Figure 7f. The supercapacitor stack could light up
the LED for more than a minute, which indicates its potential for
powering various wearable microelectronic devices. The present study
enables the development of lightweight flexible supercapacitors for
next-generation flexible and wearable devices.

Conclusions
The
synthesis of Mn3O4 NWs on CF for the
fabrication of a flexible supercapacitor is reported. Electrochemical
deposition enables the formation of NW architecture of Mn3O4 on CF substrate with high surface coverage along with
uniform growth. The Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF substrate
are highly flexible and bendable and hence used as the electrode-cum-current
collector for fabricating a flexible symmetric supercapacitor. Here,
CF functions as both the substrate for the growth of Mn3O4 NWs and a current collector for the supercapacitor.
The porous architecture of the Mn3O4 NWs helps
in boosting the pseudocapacitive charge storage, hence enabling to
achieve a maximum gravimetric capacitance of 300.7 F g–1 for the supercapacitor electrode at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. Since the CF is highly flexible and bendable with good mechanical
strength, these features are imparted to the as-fabricated supercapacitor,
where it could bend even at a severe bending angle of 180° without
sacrificing its capacitance. The symmetric supercapacitor also displayed
a long cycle life of 7500 cycles, which is very important for its
applications in wearable devices.

Experimental Section
Materials
Carbon fibers were purchased from Fibre Glast.
Manganese acetate tetrahydrate [(CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O] and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Synthesis of Mn3O4 NWs
Mn3O4 NWs were synthesized
on CF by an electrochemical
deposition method. Deposition bath consisting of 0.16 M manganese
acetate tetrahydrate and 0.16 M Na2SO4 in deionized
water was mixed well under continuous vigorous magnetic stirring.
A three-electrode cell configuration was used for depositing Mn3O4 NWs on CF substrate, in which the CF substrate,
platinum foil, and Ag/AgCl were used as the working electrode, counter
electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The CF substrate
was immersed in 0.2 M HNO3, 0.2 M HCl, and deionized water,
and each bath was ultrasonicated for 30 min. It was then dried in
an oven at 100 °C for 2 h prior to use as a substrate for electrochemically
depositing Mn3O4 NWs. Chronoamperometry technique
was used, and the Mn3O4 NWs were deposited at
a constant voltage of −1.8 V for a period of 20 min. The Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF were washed with deionized water
and dried in an oven thereafter.

Characterization of Mn3O4 NWs
The surface morphology of the Mn3O4 NWs grown
on CF was characterized by SEM (Zeiss ULTRA-55 FEG SEM). The SEM (Zeiss
ULTRA-55 FEG SEM) equipped with the Noran System 7 energy-dispersive
spectrometry system with silicon drift detector was used to perform
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The structure of Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF was determined using XRD analysis (PANalytical
Empyrean with 1.8 kW copper X-ray tube). Raman spectroscopy was performed
using Renishaw RM 1000B Micro-Raman Spectrometer with Ar, 514 nm excitation
unit. The electrochemical studies of Mn3O4 NW
electrodes and supercapacitor cell were examined using an electrochemical
workstation (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, model SP-150). The mass
of CF substrate before and after the deposition of Mn3O4 NWs was measured using a microbalance (Mettler Toledo NewClassic
MF, model MS 104S/03) to estimate the mass of active materials used
in the supercapacitor electrodes.

Supercapacitor Cell Assembly
A sandwich-type supercapacitor
cell was assembled in a symmetric configuration using two identical
Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF as electrodes and NWs
uncoated portion as the current collectors. The mass loading of Mn3O4 NWs grown on the CF substrate is found to be
9.5 mg (a weight percentage of 2.5%). The Mn3O4 NWs uncoated portion of CF was used as the current-collecting leads,
and no separate current collector was used in this study. Whatman
paper was used as the separator, and aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte.

Electrochemical Characterizations
The Mn3O4 NW electrodes were characterized
by CV and GCD measurement
in a three-electrode cell configuration. Here, Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF as the working electrode, platinum foil as
the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (in 1 M KCl) as the reference electrode
were used, and aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 solution was
used as the electrolyte. A symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated
using Mn3O4 NWs grown on CF as electrodes, Whatman
paper as the electrolyte separator membrane, and aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. EIS measurement
was performed in the frequency range of 106–0.1
Hz at 0.2 V. CV study was performed in a voltage window of 0–1
V for both individual electrodes and the assembled supercapacitor
at different scan rates. GCD was also carried out in the voltage window
of 0–1 V in both the cases.

Bending Test
The
flexibility of the symmetric supercapacitor
fabricated using Mn3O4 NW electrodes was tested
by bending the supercapacitor at various angles of 0 (straight position),
30, 60, 90, and 180°. This is performed by carrying out CV study
of the supercapacitor cell while bending the supercapacitor at different
bending angles at a constant scan rate of 100 mV s–1.
