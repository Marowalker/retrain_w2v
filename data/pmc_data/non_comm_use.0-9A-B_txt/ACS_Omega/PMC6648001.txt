Weak
noncovalent interactions between large disclike molecules
in poorly solvating media generally lead to the formation of fibers
where the molecules stack atop one another. Here, we show that a particular
chiral spacing group between large aromatic moieties, which usually
lead to columnar stacks, in this case gives rise to an intramolecularly
folded structure in relatively polar solvents, but in very apolar
solvents forms finite aggregates. The molecule that displays this
behavior has a C3 symmetric benzene-1,3,5-tris(3,3′-diamido-2,2′-bipyridine)
(BTAB) core with three metalloporphyrin units appended to it through
short chiral spacers. Quite well-defined chromophore arrangements
are evident by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of this compound
in solution, where clear exciton coupled bands of porphyrins are observed.
In more polar solvents where the molecules are dispersed, a relatively
weak CD signal is observed as a result of intramolecular folding,
a feature confirmed by molecular modeling. The intramolecular folding
was confirmed by measuring the CD of a C2 symmetric analogue. The C3 symmetric
BTAB cores that would normally be expected to stack in a chiral arrangement
in apolar solvents show no indication of CD, suggesting that there
is no transfer of chirality through it (although the expected planar
conformation of the 2,2′-bipyridine unit is confirmed by NMR
spectroscopy). The incorporation of the porphyrins on the 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine
moiety spaced by a chiral unit leaves the latter incapable of assembling
through supramolecular π–π stacking. Rather, modeling
indicates that the three metalloporphyrin units interact, thanks to
van der Waals interactions, favoring their close interactions over
that of the BTAB units. Atomic force microscopy shows that, in contrast
to other examples of molecules with the same core, disclike aggregates
(rather than fibrillar one dimensional aggregates) are favored by
the C3 symmetric molecule. The closed
structures are formed through nondirectional interlocking of porphyrin
rings. The chiral spacer between the rigid core and the porphyrin
moieties is undoubtedly important in determining the outcome in polar
or less polar solvents, as modeling shows that this joint in the molecule
has two favored conformations that render the molecule relatively
flat or convex.

Introduction
The literature is replete
with examples of large organic molecules
of disclike or calamitic shapes that assemble to give fibrillar nanostructures.1−3 These organic π-conjugated molecules with columnar organization
driven by the cofacial stacking of aromatic moieties surrounded by
alkyl chains offer great possibilities for the creation of nanomaterials
applicable in energy or charge transport in organic electronic devices,
such as solar cells or organic field-effect transistors.4,5 While different rotational symmetries have been studied for discotic
molecules,6 the C3 symmetrical structures have become among the most popular
ones.7,8 These molecules generally contain a central
core linked to three identical arms often endowed with electronic
and optical properties that can be modulated by the supramolecular
organization and morphology at the nano- and meso-scale.9 Of special interest from a point of view of the
self-assembly processes and supramolecular chirality are the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamides
(BTA) and related compounds.10−13 The ability to modify systematically the peripheral
arms emanating from the BTA core offers a great number of functional
derivatives such as water soluble supramolecular polymers,14 zwitterionic hydrogels for the encapsulation
of hydrophobic guests in water,15 or naphthalene
diimide-based helical fibers.16 The peripheral
substituents can be either directly covalently linked to the central
aromatic amide platform,17−20 or can be connected through a spacer such as 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine
that can control the self-assembly process of the molecule.21 The intramolecular hydrogen bonding within this
unit provides a rigid disc-shaped moiety favoring self-assembly driven
by π–π stacking.22,23

A broad
variety of such C3 derivatives
exists based on the 1,3,5-benzenecarboxamide core bonded to 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine,
first described by Meijer and coworkers.24,25 For example, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) compounds providing electroactive
xerogels,26 and donor–acceptor organogels
based on luminescent pyrene groups27 have
shown fascinating behavior. Introduction of chiral peripheral substituents
can ultimately lead to helical columnar supramolecular architectures
upon a hierarchical self-assembly process.28−31 In the case of chiral TTF derivatives,
helical electroactive aggregates showing inversion of supramolecular
chirality between solution and solid states were obtained.32−34 All of these examples display a fibrillar morphology thanks to the
driving force provided by stacking of the core of the molecules. However,
here we will show that intramolecularly folded structures and discrete
oligomers are also possible for this type of C3 compound. Other molecular topologies have shown folding behavior,
for example, a topologically linear compound incorporating a π-electron
donor as well as a π-electron acceptor was shown to form a folded
structure or a reverse vesicle depending on the solvent,35 while a bis(pyrene-urea) organogelator adopted
a solvent and temperature-dependent folded structure evidenced by
pyrene···pyrene excimer-based emission.36 The situation is reminiscent of proteins where
the folded and extended conformations can be responsible for different
functions,37 such as in adenosine 5′-triphosphate
(ATP) synthase for which it has been proposed that the compact state
of the protein subunit e from Escherichia coli allows both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis to occur, while the extended
conformation only permits the ATP synthesis.38,39 Another interesting example in biochemistry highlighting the importance
of controlling the folded/extended conformation of an active unit
is represented by the nicotine amide dinucleotide coenzyme which shows
extended structures when linked to a protein,40 while in the free state it adopts a folded conformation.41

Our interest in the tris(diamido-bipy)–BTA
core was kindled
by the possibility of appending porphyrins to it. These functional
units, along with the broader family of tetrapyrrolic macrocycles
linked by methine bridges, are naturally occurring chromophores42 that are essential for the photosynthetic pathway43 and in electron transport and light harvesting
processes.44 Self-assembled chiral systems
based on synthetic porphyrins45 present
a broad range of potential applications in areas such as photovoltaic
cells,46,47 sensors,48 optoelectronic49,50 and nanoelectronic devices,49 and also
nonlinear optical materials.51,52 The use of porphyrin
rings as a peripheral arm in C3 symmetric
molecules can in principle allow formation of helical stacks with
optical and electronic properties as reported by Elemans et al.53 More recently, Vela et al. have investigated
chiral and achiral tris(porphyrin) discotic C3 derivatives based on the benzenetricarboxamide-bipyridine
platform that stacks to give superhelical fibers.54 On the other hand, it has been shown that introduction
of chiral centers in the porphyrin moiety as well as metal ions can
influence hierarchical transfer of chirality into a material morphology.55

We report herein the synthesis, characterization,
and self-assembly
of the C3 symmetric tris[3-(3′-carbamoylamino)-2,2′-bipyridyl]-benzene-1,3,5-tricarbonamide
derivative 1 containing three chiral metalloporphyrin
units at the periphery as well as the related C2 symmetric bipyridyl-bis-porphyrin 10 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structure of C3 symmetric tris-porphyrin
[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 and bis-porphyrin (R,R)-10.

The hierarchical self-assembly
in solution was investigated by
circular dichroism (CD) measurements, well adapted for chiral porphyrins,56 while the morphology of the aggregates was investigated
by atomic force microscopy (AFM) after casting dilute solutions onto
surfaces.47 For this purpose, different
solvents were used to investigate the influence of the polarity of
the solvent on the supramolecular organization of the C3 molecules, as well as the influence of the nature of
the surface in the organization over it. In addition, to estimate
the role of the central platform on the self-assembly process C2 symmetric derivative 10 was investigated.
The results, supported and enlightened by molecular modeling, show
finite aggregate growth in apolar solvents as a result of the particular
conformation of the linker between the rigid core and essentially
flat porphyrins.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
C3 and C2 symmetric
compounds [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 and (R,R)-10 were prepared using
the synthetic route shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route for C3 Compound [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 and C2 Compound (R,R)-10
The free-base chiral porphyrin intermediate
(R)-4 was prepared in one step by condensation
of (R)-methyl 2-(4-formylphenoxy)propanoate (R)-257 and 4-octadecaneoxy-benzaldehyde 3(58) with pyrrole in refluxing propionic
acid in air. Then, the insertion of zinc(II) into the porphyrin core
was performed by the reaction of the acetate metal salt with the free-base
porphyrin derivative in a refluxing mixture of (dichloromethane) DCM/MeOH
to give the metallocompound (R)-5 (not
shown in Scheme 1),
which subsequently was reacted with KOH to obtain the lactic acid-derived
porphyrin (R)-6 after dissolution in
a chlorinated solvent and washing with acidic aqueous solution. The
condensation of the corresponding acid chloride, obtained by reaction
of (R)-6 and oxalyl chloride, with the
3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine 7(59) provided the monoacylated porphyrin-bipy derivative
(R)-8 (not shown in Scheme 1) with only traces of the bis-porphyrin
compound. Note that during the coupling process the zinc(II) metal
ion is ejected from the porphyrin ring as a result of the acidic conditions
employed for the formation of the acid chloride derivative.60 Monoacylated zinc porphyrin (R)-9 was then obtained as described above. The subsequent
reaction of (R)-9 with trimesic acid
chloride afforded the final C3 compound
[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1. Alternatively, when two equivalents of acid chloride of
(R)-6 were reacted with 7, bis-porphyrin compound (R,R)-10 was obtained (Figure S1).

Self-Assembly Studies by CD
CD spectroscopy is an important
tool for studying the self-assembly of chiral chromophores because
of its sensitivity to the supramolecular structure and absolute configuration.61 The chiral C3-symmetric
discotic molecule [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 herein designed can, in principle, self-assemble
through multiple noncovalent interactions that involve the various
groups in the compound. First, the bipyridine moieties rigidify the
structure thanks to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, adopting a propeller-like
conformation around the central core and in principle engaging in
intermolecular π–π interactions to provide helical
twists. In addition, here, the π–π interactions
directly related with the porphyrin skeleton as well as the coordination
of the carbonyl groups to the zinc metal ions can promote supramolecular
organization, while van der Waals interactions between the peripheral
alkyl chains may also play a role in the resulting architecture. Generally,
the noncovalent interactions involved in the hierarchical self-assembly
and their strength also depends on the nature of the solvent used.62

The self-assembly studies of C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 were performed in different solvents in order to
observe the influence of the polarity on the formation of the aggregates
through their chiroptical activity. For these studies, chloroform,
1,4-dioxane, methylcyclohexane (MCH), and dodecane have been chosen,
with the degree of polarity ranging from chloroform, as the most polar
one, to dodecane, as the most apolar.63

Solutions of C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 in each solvent
were prepared (at a concentration 5 μM), and CD spectra were
recorded in a range of temperatures (different for each solvent) after
one heating and cooling cycle to probe the assembly under equilibrium
conditions. All of the experiments were performed by recording spectra
in both heating and cooling ramps. It was observed that the CD spectra
from the different solvents do not experience clear differences in
the temperatures studied, showing a bisignate CD signal at the position
of the Soret band of the porphyrin, slightly different for each solvent,
even at higher temperatures (up to 60 °C). It should be noted
that the molecular CD (i.e., that of the totally dissolved molecule
free from aggregation) is expected to give a very weak signal because
the stereogenic center is far from the chromophore in the system.55 These results suggest either that the aggregates
form in different solvents for the C3 compound
independently of the temperature, or that intramolecular dipolar couplings
take place in the solvent isolated C3 molecule,64 especially in the more polar solvents (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Variable temperature
CD spectra for compound C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 (5 μM) in dodecane (A) and comparison of
CD spectra for the compound C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 (5 μM) at room temperature in different solvents (B).

The intensity observed in the
CD bands clearly show, however, a
dependence with the nature of the solvent, being much less intense
for the more polar solvents (Figure 2B).

Figure 2B shows
the low optical activity observed for CHCl3 and dioxane
with a bisignate signal with maxima at 430 nm (negative) and 421 nm
(positive). On the contrary, when the spectra are measured in MCH
and dodecane the optical activity observed is an order of magnitude
higher than in the more polar solvents. In the case of MCH a strong
negative trisignate signal with maxima at 437, 430, and 420 nm was
noticed, while similar results were observed in the case of the dodecane,
but with a positive shoulder located at 426 nm, suggesting that slightly
different types of porphyrin–porphyrin interactions take place.

As the C3 compound is soluble in chloroform,
the polar character of this solvent does not favor, in principle,
the self-assembly. Nevertheless, optical activity, albeit relatively
weak, is observed for CHCl3 solutions of [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1, suggesting
a probable intramolecular dipole coupling between the chromophores
(vide infra), a hypothesis supported by the absence of any CD signal
for the mono(porphyrin)-bipy precursor (R)-8 in solution at a similar concentration (Figure S2). In the case of dioxane, a solvent that in principle
might be thought to favor aggregation, the low intensity CD signal
of [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 indicates that either small aggregates were formed, or,
once again, that intramolecular exciton coupling can take place to
some degree (Figure S3).

The optical
activity observed in the CD spectra from solutions
of [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 in MCH and dodecane was much stronger than for the two more
polar solvents indicating that the apolar solvents favor the self-assembly
of this C3-symmetric molecule.

It
is worth noting that the Cotton effect observed for MCH and
dodecane (see also Figure S4) solutions
is much more intense and slightly red-shifted compared to the solutions
of chloroform and 1,4-dioxane, probably because of the formation of
aggregates through the interactions between the porphyrins as a result
of J-type aggregation.

Commonly, as mentioned above, the families
of C3 symmetric molecules based on the
benzene-1,3,5-tris(amido-2,2′-bipy)
cores self-assemble through π–π stacking of the
bipyridine units that rigidify around the central core by intramolecular
hydrogen bonding (as seen clearly in the NMR spectra of these compounds).
However, the lack of any CD signal coming from the π–π*
transition of these units, which should appear in the region from
360 to 390 nm,25 suggests that the self-assembly
is not driven by the C3 central core,
unlike all the other aggregates that we are aware of derived from
this building block. For [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1, the driving force for aggregation
is apparently through close interactions of the porphyrin rings, as
suggested by the intense CD active Soret band.

Interestingly,
the C2-symmetric compound
(R,R)-10 also shows
temperature-independent CD activity in dioxane solutions in the Soret
band region, with a negative couplet characterized by maxima at 425
and 417 nm (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Variable temperature CD spectra for compound (R,R)-10 (5 μM) in dioxane.

We hypothesize here again that the observed CD
activity is a result
of the intramolecular exciton coupling, as indicated by the relatively
low optical activity of the signal. It is well-known for bis-porphyrin
systems that the intensity of the exciton coupling signal is strongly
dependent on the interchromophoric distance and their mutual orientation.65 The magnitude of the CD signal is similar to
that of [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 in the same solvent. The slight temperature dependence
of these bands in polar solvents could be a result of the changes
in the molecular conformation, with the arrangement at low temperatures
favoring the intramolecular interaction. Indeed, the temperature dependence
of the absorption bands of [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 in polar solvents is very different
to that in dodecane (Figure S5), as also
seen in the bis(porphyrin) compound (R,R)-10 (Figure S6). The intramolecularly
folded conformation shows a slight temperature dependence, while the
dodecane sample shows a more abrupt loss of the CD signal above 20
°C, indicating disassembly of the aggregate, consistent with
the broadening and concomitant blue shift of the corresponding absorption
band.

Molecular Modeling
Considering the large size of bis(porphyrin)
(R,R)-10 and [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1, calculations have been performed on model systems of growing size
with a combination of molecular mechanics (MM) and dynamics (MD) as
well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see Computational Details).

Bis-porphyrin (R,R)-10
For the bis-porphyrin
(R,R)-10, a simplified
model without any stereogenic
center and with simple porphyrin without any phenyl moieties attached
to it were employed. MM reveals that the two most stable conformers
present a large interaction between the porphyrin cores that stabilize
the system through π–π interactions. Those two
conformers are mirror images of one another, with P and M helical
configurations (see Figure S7). Other conformers
were identified presenting weak or no interaction between the porphyrin
cores, but those conformers are much higher in energy. When adding
the methyl group to form the R stereogenic center, the M conformer
has methyl in the axial position and the P conformer will have methyl
in the equatorial position (Figure 4A,B). This situation favors the M conformer by 7.3
kcal/mol in comparison with P at the DFT level of theory. For the
more stable conformer M we computed the absorption and electron-capture
detector (ECD) spectra (Figure 4C,D). We obtained a very clear bisignate signal for the Soret
band around 350 nm with a clear −/+ sign typical of an M helix,
in good agreement with the experiment. The discrepancy between the
experiment and theory for the position of the peak can be explained
by the simplification of the model and the lack of the solvent in
the calculation. Finally, for the M conformer, we introduced the phenyl
rings and short tails made of five carbon atoms, the system being
now composed of 290 carbon atoms. It is noticeable that the introduction
of the phenyl groups and tails has an influence on the overlap between
the porphyrin cores, reinforcing it (see Figure S8).

Figure 4 P and M conformers (A,B) and calculated ECD and absorption spectra
of the M conformer (C,D) of the bis-porphyrin (R,R)-10.

Tris-porphyrin [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1
As for the bis-porphyrin (R,R)-10, the conformational
study reveals that the methyl group of the stereogenic center in [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 will prefer to sit on the axial position, with the phenyl moieties
that link it to the porphyrin situated below the core of the molecule
(Figure 5). Moreover,
two possible values have been identified for the dihedral angle ϕ
responsible for the position of the phenyl and porphyrins moieties
and two conformers can be identified, namely, a folded and a more
planar conformation. In the folded conformation (ϕ = 54.3°),
the three porphyrins are folded below the core of the molecule (BTA
+ bipyridine), while in the planar conformation (ϕ = 159.1°)
the porphyrins are approximately in the same plane of the core of
the molecule.

Figure 5 (A) Definition of the dihedral angle ϕ and (B) representation
of the two possible conformations for the porphyrins (only one porphyrin
was shown for clarity). (C) Top and side view for the folded and planar
conformation.

To assess how those two
conformations of [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 will behave
in different solvents, we performed MD simulations in dodecane and
chloroform with both the folded and open conformations as starting
points. It appears that independently of the solvent, the molecule
undergoes rapid conformational changes with the porphyrin arms changing
several times between folded and flat conformations during the 50
ns of the dynamics run.

Then, we performed a simulation with
a dimer of C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 with flat conformers
placed in dodecane and chloroform
(see Computational Details). At the beginning
of the simulations the molecules are close to each other as can be
seen in Figure 6, but
the behavior of the dimer differs drastically in the two solvents.
In chloroform they separate gradually and flip between the flat and
folded conformation to reach a distance of 5 nm at the end of the
dynamic (50 ns), while in dodecane, the two molecules stayed together
for the whole dynamic. This can be observed looking at the van der
Waals and Coulombic interactions between the two molecules and between
each molecule and the solvent (Figures S9 and S10). Indeed, in dodecane we see that the main contribution
between the two molecules is due to the van der Waals interaction
which increased along the trajectory together with a decrease of the
interaction between the molecule and the solvent. For chloroform however,
the van der Waals interaction decreases as the molecules separate.
This behavior in different solvents seems to indicate that C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 will have a tendency to aggregate
in apolar solvents such as dodecane or MCH, and to remain isolated
in polar solvents such as chloroform and dioxane. This allows us to
attribute the weak ECD signal in the polar solvent to an intramolecular
chirality while the large ECD signal in the apolar solvent is attributed
to the intermolecular chirality resulting from exciton coupling between
the porphyrins in neighboring molecules in the aggregate.

a dimer of C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 in different solvents.
In chloroform the two molecules separate
along the MD trajectory, while in dodecane the two molecules stay
together for the whole dynamic.

Morphology Studies by AFM
In order to determine the
morphology of the apparent aggregates observed by CD spectroscopy,
we studied the material left upon evaporation of solutions of [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 on flat surfaces. The discotic molecule [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 was studied in different
solvent solutions (all at an initial concentration of 5 μM)
that were deposited on solid supports by drop casting, allowing the
aggregates to be investigated by AFM using the intermittent contact
mode.

A number of parameters play important roles in the process
of transferring the self-assembly molecules from the solution to a
solid support such as molecule–molecule or molecule–surface
interactions, as well as the solvent–surface interaction and
evaporation rates.66 The nature of the
surface is an important factor to take into account to successfully
adsorb the aggregates in a controlled way because of the significant
molecule–surface interactions or because of dewetting of the
solution from the surface.67

In this
work, different surfaces were used to study the hierarchical
organization of the C3 molecules when
one drop of solutions was deposited on the surface. Highly oriented
pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) was chosen for its hydrophobic character,
which favors the van der Waals interactions between the surface and
the long alkyl chains at the periphery of the porphyrin ring.68 On the other hand, a hydrophilic surface such
as mica that could interact with the core of C3 through the amide groups was also tested.69,70

Topographic images on HOPG show globular objects as the main
morphology
when solutions of the discotic molecule were cast on the surface (Figure 7). The profile of
the larger objects reveals heights of about 30 nm in the case of chloroform,
while the small objects observed present heights around 7 nm. In the
case of the dodecane sample it was difficult to scan the sample very
accurately, even working in the tapping mode, as the tip was sticking
to the surface. However, as Figure 7D shows, the surface is covered by very small globular
objects with heights around 3 nm that might correspond to dimer aggregates.
The difference in height of the aggregates between solvents might
suggest that the evaporation rate is an important factor to take into
account for the formation of the globular aggregates. Notably, the
samples from both chloroform and dioxane show large flat domains in
addition to the globular objects (Figure 7A,B). These areas are interpreted as monolayer
regions resulting from the deposition of monomers during the concentrating
solution, leading to the formation of these flat areas. Also, importantly,
all of the samples show smaller disclike aggregates, seen most clearly
for the dodecane solution that might indicate the formation of dimers
of the compound that could explain the spectroscopic observations
in solution.

(B), MCH (C), dodecane (D).

One drop of solutions of the C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 compound in the previously mentioned solvents was also deposited
onto a mica surface (see Figure S11). Their
topographic images analyzed by AFM show that the major objects observed
on the surface present the globular morphology of large objects with
an average height of 60 nm, indicating a nonspecific aggregation possibility
as a result of dewetting from the hydrophilic surface upon evaporation
of the solvent.

Conclusions
The CD study of [Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 indicates a conformation with intramolecular
porphyrin interactions in polar solvents, where the optical activity
is weaker than in the case of supramolecular aggregates. The conformers
are sensitive to temperature, and molecular modeling indicates that
folding of the molecule appears to be challenged because of the largely
rigid structure. Theoretical calculations do predict a weak interaction
between the porphyrin rings that could explain the observed CD signals
for the molecularly dissolved compounds. The incorporation of the
porphyrins on the 3,3′-diamido-2,2′-bipyridine unit
through the chiral linker apparently renders the aromatic units incapable
of entering into significant supramolecular π–π
stacking. Rather, in apolar solvents, the porphyrin moieties overlap
giving rise to greater optical activity. The AFM measurements clearly
show that this aggregation is not a result of a fibrillar one dimensional
assembly, unlike other examples of molecules with the same core. In
the present case the objects presumably form closed structures because
of the relatively nondirectional interlocking of porphyrin rings.
The chiral spacer between the rigid core and the porphyrin moieties
could be important in determining this mode of self-assembly in these
and other supramolecular materials.71

Section
Materials and Methods
(R)-Methyl 02-(4-formylphenoxy)propanoate
(2)57 and 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine
(7)59 were prepared according
to the literature procedures. All other starting materials were purchased
from commercial sources and used as received. The NMR spectra were
recorded in a CDCl3 solution, and 1H NMR spectra
were measured either on a Bruker AVANCEII 300 or Bruker AVANCE DRX
300. 1H NMR spectra are referenced to the residual protonated
solvent CHCl3 (1H, δ = 7.26, CDCl3). Mass spectrometry was performed with an Ultraflex (TOF/TOF)
spectrometer (LDI-TOF) and on a Bruker Biflex-IIITM apparatus, equipped
with a 337 nm N2 laser (MALDI-TOF). All Fourier transform
infrared measurements were recorded with a PerkinElmer (spectrum one)
apparatus. The samples were solid compounds (recovered after evaporation
of the solvent in a noncontrolled precipitated way) and measurements
were performed in the attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. The
samples were measured on the plate of universal ATR. Topographic AFM
images were acquired in the dynamic tapping mode using a FORT Si tip
in the Servei de AFM of the ICMAB (Barcelona, Spain) in an Agilent
5100 microscope. Solutions of C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 were drop casted onto a HOPG surface or mica surface, and measurements
were performed under ambient conditions. The color code in all the
images shown is such that dark are lower and bright are higher values
of the height.

CD and
UV–Vis Measurements
Jasco J-275 and Jasco
J-815 spectropolarimeters were used for CD spectra measurements. A
Peltier-temperature programmer was used to perform variable temperature
measurements. The solutions were prepared by diluting a solid sample
either of C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 or bis-porphyrin (R,R)-10 in the corresponding
amount of the solvent and the solution was heated until all the compounds
had dissolved to obtain 5 μM as a final concentration. The samples
were transferred to a standard quartz cuvette of 1 cm length to be
analyzed. When the measurement temperature was reached and stabilized,
spectra were recorded. UV–visible absorption measurements were
performed using a UV–vis–NIR Varian, model Cary 5 instrument
using a 1 cm length standard quartz cuvette. All the samples were
prepared by diluting a solid sample of C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1 in the corresponding amounts of the solvent. The solution
was heated until all the compounds dissolved to obtain 5 μM
as a final concentration.

Computational Details
MM with the
MM3 force field were
used to identify the different conformers for both bis(porphyrin)
(R,R)-10 and for C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1. DFT calculations were performed
with the Gaussian program, and optimizations were done at the B3LYP/6-31G(D)
level of theory with an empirical correction to take into account
dispersion for both bis(porphyrin) (R,R)-10 and for C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1. Absorption and CD spectra were calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d)
level of theory for the bis(porphyrin) (R,R)-10. The first 10 excited states were calculated
and were broadened with a Gaussian function with a full width at half
maximum of 0.1 eV.

For C3-[Zn-(R,R,R)]-1, MD simulations were performed using the Gromacs program package72−74 in combination with the GROMOS 54B7 force field.75 In all simulations, we used periodic boundary conditions.
MD simulations in an NPT ensemble were carried out
maintaining the temperature at 300 K with the v-Rescale thermostat
and coupling constant of 0.2 ps. A Berendsen barostat with a coupling
constant of 1 ps was employed to maintain the pressure at 1 atm. MD
simulations in the NVT ensemble were carried out
maintaining the temperature at 300 K with a v-Rescale thermostat and
coupling constant of 0.2 ps. The electrostatic and van der Waals interactions
were both calculated with a cut-off distance of 1.5 nm.

The
boxes of solvents were obtained after simulation in the NPT ensemble for 50 ns with a converged density of 776 and
1528 kg/m3 for dodecane and chloroform, respectively. Boxes
of 12 × 12 × 12 nm3 were then created by solvating
a single molecule in two conformations (open and folded) or dimer
in the two solvents. MD simulations were carried out for 50 ns in
the NVT ensemble.
