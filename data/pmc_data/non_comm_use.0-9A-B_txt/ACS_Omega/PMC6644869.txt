(NMPAP)-co-4-(acrylamido)-4-methyl pentanoate (AMP)-co-N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA)] (i.e.,
GGTI-g-TetraP), a novel interpenetrating tetrapolymer
network-based sustainable hydrogel, possessing extraordinary physicochemical
properties and excellent recyclability, has been synthesized via grafting
of GGTI and in situ strategic protrusion of NMPAP and AMP during the
solution polymerization of SA and NIPA, through systematic multistage
optimization of ingredients and temperature, for ligand-selective
superadsorption of hazardous metal ions (M(II)), such as Sr(II), Hg(II),
and Cu(II). The in situ allocation of NMPAP and AMP via N–H
and C–H activations, grafting of GGTI into the SA-co-NMPAP-co-AMP-co-NIPA (TetraP)
matrix, the effect of comonomer compositions on ligand-selective adsorption,
crystallinity, thermal stabilities, surface properties, swellability,
adsorption capacities (ACs), mechanical properties, and the superadsorption
mechanism have been apprehended via extensive microstructural analyses
of unloaded and/or loaded GGTI-g-TetraP1 and GGTI-g-TetraP2 bearing SA/NIPA in 8:1 and 2:1 ratios, respectively,
using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), 1H/13C/DEPT-135 NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric
analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, field
emission scanning electron microscopy, rheological analysis, and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry, along with measuring % gel content, pH at point
of zero charge (pHPZC), and % graft ratio. The thermodynamically
spontaneous chemisorption has been inferred from FTIR, XPS, fitting
of kinetics data to pseudo-second-order model, and activation energies.
The chemisorption data have exhibited excellent fitting to the Langmuir
isotherm model. For Sr(II), Hg(II), and Cu(II), ACs were 1940.24/1748.36,
1759.50/1848.03, and 1903.64/1781.63 mg g–1, respectively,
at 293 K, 0.02 g of GGTI-g-TetraP1/2, and initial
concentration of M(II) = 500–1000 ppm.

==== Body
Introduction
An interpenetrating
polymer network (IPN)-type hydrogel is produced
via grafting of a natural polymer into a co-, ter-, and tetrapolymer
network, synthesized via polymerization of two, three, and four synthetic
monomers, followed by cross-linking the matrix.1 The swelling of hydrogels depends on several synthetic
parameters, such as pH, temperature, monomer ratio, wt % of natural
polymer, cross-linkers, and initiators.2,3 Hydrogels,
especially magnetic hydrogels, are widely employed for the removal
of waste contaminants, drug delivery, manufacturing of contact lenses,
and biosensing of glucose, hepatitis B antigen, cholesterol, hemoglobin
A1c, uric acid, and human metabolites.4−6 Additionally, hydrogels
are also effectively used in size exclusion chromatography, ion exchangers,
and membrane-based applications.7,8

The waste effluents
of several industries contain toxic Sr(II),
Hg(II), and Cu(II), of which Sr(II) causes anemia, abnormal bleeding,
and deficiencies in immunity power/bone growth. Hg(II) is extensively
used in gold mining, gold recovery from electronic waste, chlor-alkali,
and vinyl chloride production. Alongside, all forms of Hg cause gastrointestinal
disorder, neurologic malfunction, and renal problem and impose detrimental
effects on lungs, kidneys, digestive system, brain, and reproductive
system in human beings.9 Cu(II) influences
the alteration in chemical parameters of water, such as hardness,
pH, alkalinity, natural organic matter, and freshwater organisms.10 Besides, Cu(II) contamination imparts physiological
complications, such as destruction of liver and kidney, hemolysis,
demolition of living tissues, occurrence of influenza syndrome, damage
of aquatic food chain, acute vomiting, convulsions, cramps, and carcinogenicity.
Several methods, such as ion exchange, biological treatment, chemical
oxidation, photocatalytic degradation, coagulation/flocculation, membrane-based
separation, and adsorption, have been employed, of which adsorption
is the most widely employed technique for the detoxification of polluted
wastewater, owing to the impulsive versatility, simple instrumentation,
flexible design, cost-effectivity, accuracy, selectivity, and reusability
of the adsorbent.

Though polyacrylic acid (PAA)-based hydrogels
are frequently used
for targeted drug delivery, poor mechanical stability and high water
solubility limit the usability of the PAA hydrogels. Despite having
a better thermomechanical property, the poor pH sensitivity restricts
the widespread applications of poly-N-isopropylacrylamide
(PNIPA) hydrogels. Additionally, the homopolymers of acrylamido derivatives
show high water solubility and poor sustainability. Hence, IPN hydrogels
were prepared via grafting of gum ghatti (GGTI) and combining the
properties of sodium acrylate (SA), NIPA, 3-(N-(4-(4-methyl
pentanoate))acrylamido)propanoate (NMPAP), and 4-(acrylamido)-4-methyl
pentanoate (AMP). GGTI, an anionic high-molecular-weight complex polysaccharide,
possesses excellent biodegradability, pH stability, and gelling characteristics.
The complex structure of GGTI is primarily composed of α-l-arabinofuranose (α-l-Araf,
49.69–72.85%), β-d-galactopyranose (β-d-Galp, 16.43–37.27%), β-d-glucoronopyranose (β-d-GlcpA, 2.03–14.31%),
α-l-rhamnopyranose (α-l-Rhap, 2.10–8.03%), and proteins (1.99–3.78%). The hairy
region of GGTI is constructed by 1,6-linked β-d-Galp residues at O-3 and O-4, whereas the smooth region possesses
→2)-α-l-Araf-(1→4)-β-d-GlcpA-(1→6)-β-d-Galp-(1→6)-β-d-Galp-(1→
linkage of backbone. Introduction of GGTI enhanced the population
of −COO– in GGTI-g-TetraPs,
which made these more suitable for M(II) adsorption. In this regard,
several works were devoted to produce natural polymer-based hydrogels
containing pectin,2 guar gum,1,3 chitosan,11 xanthan gum,12 agarose,13 wheat bran,14 and GGTI.15 Similarly,
several homo-, co-, ter-, and tetrapolymeric hydrogels were already
reported for drug delivery and water treatment.16−20 The mechanical weakness and fragility of homo-/copolymers
could be surmounted by using ter-/multipolymer hydrogels, which offer
improvement in the hydrogel structure and provide high mechanical
strength and enhanced sensitivity toward physical and chemical stimuli.
In this context, few researchers have synthesized tetrablock polymers
by ex situ incorporation of four monomers.21−24 For the first time, the synthesis
of a natural polymer-grafted tetrapolymeric IPN using only two monomers
and in situ auxiliary protrusion of NMPAP and AMP monomers, via N–H
and C–H activations during solution polymerization, has been
reported. Till date, very few works have reported the transformation
of quaternary sp2 carbon into quaternary sp3 carbon during free-radical polymerization.13,25−28 However, the transformation of tertiary vinylic and isopropyl carbon
into quaternary sp3 carbon via C–H activation during
solution polymerization is still to be explored. Furthermore, the
synthesis of a tailor-made interpenetrating tetrapolymeric network
superadsorbent by varying comonomer ratios via C–H and N–H
activations to impart two new monomers, such as NMPAP and AMP; evaluation
of the ligand-selective superadsorption mechanism of Sr(II), Hg(II),
and Cu(II); and extensive microstructural analyses of unloaded and/or
loaded hydrogels, along with the estimation of adsorption isotherm,
kinetics, and thermodynamics parameters are not reported anywhere.

Experimental
Section
Materials
AA, NIPA, GGTI, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide
(MBA), potassium persulfate (PPS), sodium bisulfite (SBS), Sr(NO3)2, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, and HgCl2 of analytical grades were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further modification.

Synthesis
of Hydrogels
GGTI-g-TetraP
hydrogels were synthesized by free-radical solution polymerization
via grafting of GGTI into the tetrapolymer network and in situ auxiliary
protrusion of NMPAP and AMP into SA-co-NIPA using
MBA and PPS/SBS as redox initiators in N2 atmosphere. A
series of hydrogels were synthesized via successive incorporation
of varied dosages of SA, NIPA, PPS/SBS, and MBA at different temperatures
and pH. From the measurements of swelling of the as-prepared hydrogels,
conditions for obtaining the hydrogel bearing maximum equilibrium
swelling ratio (ESR) were determined (Scheme S1). Two different GGTI-g-TetraPs, one possessing
the optimum conditions (GGTI-g-TetraP1, SA/NIPA =
8:1) and the other containing different SA/NIPA ratios (GGTI-g-TetraP2,
SA/NIPA = 2:1), were synthesized. Initially, two homogeneous GGTI
solutions, each containing 0.5 g of GGTI in 30.00 mL of H2O at 313 K, were prepared using an ultrasonicator to ensure complete
dissolution of GGTI. Such GGTI suspension was then taken in a round-bottomed
flask, followed by the dropwise addition of the SA solution (0.23/0.16
mol prepared in 24.92/21.64 mL water) at 30 drops min–1 for GGTI-g-TetraP1/2 at pH = 5.50 and NIPA solution
(0.03/0.08 mol prepared in 27.08/30.36 mL water for GGTI-g-TetraP1/2) with constant stirring at 300 rpm. Thereafter, MBA solution
(0.52 mmol prepared in 10.00 mL water) was added at 298 K, and the
resultant solution was allowed to homogenize under N2 atmosphere
for 8 h. Thereafter, polymerization was initiated via gradual addition
of redox initiators, prepared in 8.00 mL water, by the amounts 0.74
and 1.9 mmol, respectively (Scheme 1). The prepared GGTI-g-TetraPs were
allowed to swell in 1:3 methanol/water solution (v/v) and washed several
times for the complete removal of unreacted monomers and water-soluble
oligomers. Finally, GGTI-g-TetraPs were air-dried
for 3 days, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 323 K.

of GGTI-g-TetraP
Characterization
GGTI-g-TetraP1 was
characterized using techniques as given in Table S1. Additionally, GGTI-g-TetraPs were characterized
by measuring % gel content (% GC), % graft ratio (% GR), % −COOH,
pH at point of zero charge (pHPZC), and ESRs at different
pHi and temperatures. All graphics-based analyses and chemical
structures were done by Origin 9.0 and ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 software.

Methodology
M(II) solutions of varying concentrations,
that is, 10–60 and 1000–2000 ppm, were prepared by the
exact dilution of 5000 ppm stock solutions. In the present study,
0.02 g of dry GGTI-g-TetraP was added to 50 mL buffered
solutions of M(II) with constant stirring at 300 rpm. The progress
of adsorption was monitored using an atomic absorption spectrometer
(PerkinElmer A-ANALYST 100). From the precalibrated equation, the
concentration (Ct) of
M(II) was calculated and qt (mg g–1) was determined using eq 1. 1

855 (asym. C–N–C str. of −CON<), 529 (Cu–N), and 437 (Cu–O) (Figure S1b and Table S2).

In GGTI-g-TetraP1, grafting of GGTI into
TetraP1
could be realized from the arrival of a new peak at 1123 cm–1, attributed to the formation of a new −H2C–O–CH2– linkage via polymerization between −CH2Ȯ of GGTI and ĊH2–(Cq)– of TetraP1 (Figure S1a). The
formation of −H2C–O–CH2– in GGTI-g-TetraP1, originally absent in
GGTI/TetraP1, could also be substantiated from the disappearance and
simultaneous arrival of GGTI specific −CH2– twisting/C–O str. of −CH2OH and asym./sym. −CH2– str. of −OCH2–
at 1026/1088 and 2962/2857 cm–1, respectively. Additionally,
the formation of −H2C–O–CH2– could also be apprehended by the arrival of a new peak at
810 cm–1 because of coupling of −CH2– rocking and C–O str. of −O–CH2–. Moreover, during the
synthesis of TetraP1, the in situ protrusion of NMPAP, via conversion
of secondary to tertiary amides, could be apprehended by the appearance
of tertiary amide specific asym. C–N–C str. and N–C=O in-plane def. at 869 and 609 cm–1, respectively. Significant
alterations of such peaks were noted in GGTI-g-TetraP1
because of grafting-driven massive changes in both O–H···O–H
and O–H···N–H H-bonds influencing C–H def. of gem-dimethyl groups of NIPA, asym. −CH2– str., amide-I/-II
bands, C–C=O def., and N–C=O
in-plane def. of secondary amides (Table S2). In this context, several GGTI specific peaks, such
as glycosidic linkage of the carbohydrate chain and pyranose ring,
altered markedly in GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Table S2). Notably, the appearance of the amide-III band at
1320 and 1313/1266 cm–1 for TetraP1 and GGTI-g-TetraP1, respectively, indicated the prevalence of sterically
favored trans configuration for NIPA moieties.

Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. Sr(II) interacted with
−COO– of GGTI-g-TetraP1
via ionic and various coordination modes, such as BB, BC, and M (Scheme S2), as realized from the variegated Δν
values of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Table 1 and Figure S1b). Ionization of −COOH into −COO– and preferential coordination of Sr(II) with −COO– of GGTI-g-TetraP1 led to several changes in both
O–H···O–H and O–H···N–H
H-bonds, resulting in diversified alterations of C=O str. of H-bonded dimeric −COOH, −H2C–O–CH2– linkage, C–C=O def., amide-I/-II/-III, glycosidic linkage, C–H def. of gem-dimethyl groups of NIPA, asym. C–N–C str., and N–C=O
in-plane def. of tertiary amide (Table S2). Indeed, lowering of weak O–H···N–H
H-bonding peak in Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 was ascribed
to the relatively fewer availability of O–H, owing to the preferential
attachment of Sr(II) with O-donors, supported by the formation of
the Sr–O bond at 536 cm–1. Notably, the peaks
at 1463/1089 and 862/690 cm–1 in Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 might be responsible for asym./sym. C–O str. and out-of-plane/in-plane def. of isolated planar CO32–.29

Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. The
preferential attachment
of Hg(II) with amide could be ascertained via the appearance of Hg–N
covalent bond at 517 cm–1. Additionally, the characteristic
peak of C–C=O def. shifted from 533
to 460 cm–1 (Figure S1b). The notable reduction in mutual O–H···N–H
H-bonds in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 due to the involvement
of N–H into >N–Hg–N< cross-links led to
the
appearance of relatively sharp O–H str. at
3585 and 3526 cm–1. Though Hg(II) was relatively
reluctant to interact with the O-donor, the possible coordination
with −COO– occurred preferably through M
and BC modes (Scheme S2, Table 1), realized from the appearance
of a very sharp peak at 1614 cm–1 and broad intense
shoulders at 1558 and 1530 cm–1. Besides, interaction
of Hg(II) with amides and −COO– led to several
changes in H-bonds, imparting diversified alterations of several peaks.

Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. In Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1, the predominant BB and M modes were evidenced
from the characteristic Δν values (Table 1). Nevertheless, the coordination between
amides and Cu(II) was realized from Cu–O- and Cu–N specific
peaks at 437 and 529 cm–1, respectively. As a consequence
of such a coordinate bonding, possible existence of the malachite-type
Cu(II) complex onto Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 was confirmed
from the appearance of a peak at 1341 cm–1.30 Similar to other M(II), ionization of −COOH
and associated changes in H-bonds were manifested in the alteration
of several characteristic peaks of various functional groups in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Table S2).

1H NMR Analysis
The formation of −H2C(β)–CH2(α)–C=O
and −H2C(β)–CH(C=O)– saturated backbone
moieties from H2C=CH–C=O was inferred
by the appearance of all possible (−CH2(α)–, −CH−)/–CH2(β)– within 2.00–2.36/0.86–1.58
and 2.01–2.62/0.85–1.58 ppm in TetraP1 (Figure S3) and GGTI-g-TetraP1
(Figure 1), respectively.
In fact, the simultaneous obsolescence of vinyl proton specific peaks
within 6.03–6.59, 5.60–6.22, and 5.59–6.13 ppm
for SA, NIPA, and MBA, respectively, confirmed the conversion of H2C=CH–C=O into
−CH2–CH2–C=O and
−H2C–CH(C=O)– in TetraP1 and
GGTI-g-TetraP1.4 Again,
the inclusion of NIPA and MBA in the network of both TetraP1/GGTI-g-TetraP1 was ascertained from the arrival of characteristic
peaks for −CH3 of NIPA and −CH2– of MBA at 1.27/1.25 and 4.32/4.34 ppm,
respectively. The characteristic peak at 4.00 ppm for −CH– of −CH(CH3)2 in NIPA31 was receded from view in both
TetraP1 and GGTI-g-TetraP1 because of the formation
of quaternary carbon moieties, such as −CH2(Cq)CONH–((Cq)(Me2)–CH2(Cq)COOH) (Figure 2b) and −CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH (Figure 2b) via C–H activation.
However, free-radical propagation between −COṄ((Cq)(Me2)−) of NIPA and ĊH2(Cq)CO– of SA resulted in the formation of −CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH (Figure 2b) moiety via N–H activation, which
was inferred from the arrival of new broad N–CH2 specific peaks within 3.49–3.51 and 3.49–3.53
ppm in TetraP1 (Figure S3) and GGTI-g-TetraP1, respectively (Figure 1). Furthermore, the characteristic N–H peaks of NIPA/MBA were observed at 6.99/7.50/7.75/8.61 ppm
in GGTI-g-TetraP1.

GGTI is a complex polysaccharide,
comprising T-α-l-Araf, β-d-Galp,
β-d-GlcpA, and α-l-Rhap. The 1H NMR spectrum of GGTI (Figure S2) showed the characteristic peaks of H-1, H-2/H-4,
H-3, and H-5 of T-α-l-Araf at 5.25,
4.18, 3.62, and 3.80 ppm, respectively.32 The peaks at 4.78, 3.41, and 3.85 ppm were designated as H-1, H-2/H-3,
and H-4/H-5/H-6 of β-d-Galp, respectively.33 Moreover, the anomeric protons of β-d-GlcpA and α-l-Rhap appeared at 4.48 and 5.03 ppm, respectively.33 The GGTI specific peaks at 5.34, 4.15, 3.65, and 3.88 ppm
of H-1, H-2/H-4, H-3, and H-4/H-5/H-6 of T-α-l-Araf and β-d-Galp, respectively,33 were found in GGTI-g-TetraP1.
Additionally, the anomeric protons of β-d-GlcpA and α-l-Rhap occurred
at 4.43 and 5.05 ppm, respectively, in GGTI-g-TetraP1.
In fact, grafting of GGTI onto TetraP1 was inferred from the noteworthy
shifting of the characteristic −CH2OH peak of T-α-l-Araf from
3.80 ppm in GGTI to the −CH2–O–CH2– specific peak at 3.75
ppm in GGTI-g-TetraP1 via −CH2Ȯ formation,33 realized
earlier by FTIR analyses (Table S2).

13C NMR Analysis
From Figures S4a and 2a, complete disappearance
of the characteristic H2C(β)=C(α)H–C=O peaks at 127.87(α)/132.97(β),
125.49(α)/131.30(β), and 125.53(α)/130.88(β)
ppm for SA, NIPA, and MBA, respectively, in both TetraP1 and GGTI-g-TetraP1 inferred the occurrence of free-radical polymerization
between SA and NIPA, followed by subsequent cross-linking via MBA.
Again, the prevalent intense and downfield peaks, at 161.10/176.22/178.62
and 160.04–169.84/171.68/175.65 ppm, inferred the presence
of −CONHCH2NHCO–
of MBA/–CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH
(Figure 2b)/–CH2(Cq)CONH–((Cq)(Me2)–CH2(Cq)COOH) (Figure 2b) in TetraP1 and GGTI-g-TetraP1, respectively.4,34 Moreover,
the peaks at 181.09/185.96 and 180.12/184.57 ppm were ascribed to
the existence of −(Cq)–COOH/–(Cq)–COO– in TetraP1 and
GGTI-g-TetraP1, respectively.35 In this context, the appearance of a peak at 176.96 ppm
was related to the presence of β-d-GlcpA in GGTI-g-TetraP1.36 On another note, the sharp peaks at 23.86 and 23.00 ppm were ascribed
to −CH3 of NIPA in TetraP1 and GGTI-g-TetraP1, respectively, inferred from the appearance of
a positive peak in DEPT-135 (Figure S4b). Moreover, the characteristic −CH2– peaks of MBA, −CH2(Cq)COOH, −CH2(Cq)COO–, −CH2(Cq)CONH((Cq)(Me2)−), −CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH (Figure 2b), and −CH2(Cq)CONH–((Cq)(Me2)–CH2(Cq)COOH) (Figure 2b) appeared at 42.74, 32.58, 33.43, 30.18,
39.66, and 37.79 ppm in TetraP1 and 42.38, 32.35, 34.83, 30.19, 39.75,
and 37.56 ppm in GGTI-g-TetraP1,35,37 respectively, inferred from negative signals in DEPT-135 (Figure S4b). However, the absence of the characteristic
peak for −CH(CH3)2 of NIPA
at 43.40 ppm38 and the absence of any positive
peak in DEPT-135 confirmed the abstraction of the −CH–
proton from −CH(CH3)2 of
NIPA to produce a quaternary carbon. In fact, the characteristic peaks
at 46.67/51.38 and 46.15/52.03 ppm28,39 in 13C NMR of TetraP1 and GGTI-g-TetraP1, respectively, confirmed the
formation of −CH2(Cq)COOH, −CH2(Cq)COO–, −CH2(Cq)CONH((Cq)(Me2)−), and −CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH (Figure 2b) moieties via C–H activation. Indeed,
the appearance of a quaternary carbon was further justified from the
absence of such peaks in DEPT-135 (Figure 2b).

The presence of GGTI in GGTI-g-TetraP1 was confirmed by the prevalence of several GGTI
specific peaks, such as 17.27, 61.46, 62.79, 67.14, 68.95, 70.11,
71.32, 72.26, 73.48, 74.50, 75.90, 76.48, 77.78, 77.93, 78.03, 79.40,
83.30, 85.00, 101.10, 104.98, 105.05, and 108.87 ppm (Figure 2a). In fact, the peaks at 108.87–111.18,
104.98–106.05, 101.10–102.35, 95.15–98.59, and
89.19–93.04 ppm were associated with the anomeric carbons of
T-α-l-Araf, β-d-Galp/β-d-GlcpA, α-l-Rhap, α-galactose, and α-d-glucose, respectively.32,33,39,40 Moreover, the characteristic
peaks of C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-5 of T-α-l-Araf and β-d-GlcpA appeared at 83.30, 78.03, 85.00–87.00,
and 62.79 ppm32 and 73.48, 75.90, 79.40,
and 77.93 ppm,33 respectively. However,
the symbolic peaks of C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 of β-d-Galp and α-l-Rhap appeared
at 72.26, 74.50, 68.95, 76.48, and 61.46 ppm,36 and 67.14, 77.78, 71.32, 70.11, and 17.27 ppm,33 respectively (Table 2).

X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
The
deconvoluted spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s orbitals of GGTI-g-TetraP1 and Sr(II)-/Hg(II)-/Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Table 3)
showed the prevalence of indirect interaction between M(II) and C-center
of GGTI-g-TetraP1 during adsorption. In fact, because
of active participation of O-/N-center adjacent to C-atoms, relatively
lesser shifting in the binding energies (BEs) of C 1s than N 1s and
O 1s was observed in M(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure 3). The deconvoluted
O 1s peaks at 530.32, 532.35, 534.10, 537.96, and 541.13 eV in GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure 3b) were attributed to >C=O,2 −COO–,1 −COOH,1 HOH of liquid water clusters containing more
than 1000 water molecules,1 and shake-up
satellite band of the O atom in the −CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH segment of GGTI-g-TetraP1,
respectively.1 Moreover, the N 1s peak
at 401.02 eV (inset of Figure 3h) was attributed to −CH2(Cq)CON+H–((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH and −CH2(Cq)CON+H2–((Cq)(Me2)–CH2(Cq)COOH) moieties.

Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. The O 1s spectra of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 were
deconvoluted into four peaks (Figure 3d), of which the peak at 532.87
eV was assigned to −COO–,1 coordinated preferably via BC and BB modes. In
addition, the enhancement in the BEs of >C=O/–COOH specific peaks in Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1
from 530.32/534.10 to 531.17/534.82 eV (Table 3) emphasized the participation of lone pair
electrons in bonding with Sr(II). In this context, the strong interaction
between Sr(II) and −COO– could also be realized
from the significant reduction in the characteristic Sr 3d5/2 peak from 134.20 eV of pure Sr(II) to 133.49 eV in Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure 3e), indicating the deposition of SrCO3 onto Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1.

Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1.
The significant reduction
in the N 1s BE of GGTI-g-TetraP1 from 401.02 to 397.89
eV in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure 3h) inferred the formation of covalent bonds
between Hg(II) and N-center of −CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH and −CH2(Cq)CONH–((Cq)(Me2)–CH2(Cq)COOH)3 in pHi > pHPZC, also evidenced from FTIR (Figure S1b). The formation of the Hg–N
covalent bond was inferred from the substantial enhancement in the
BEs of Hg 4f7/2/Hg 4f5/2 from 102.58/106.68
eV of Hg(II) to 103.47/107.43 eV in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure 3i).3 However, the formation of weak ionic
bonds between Hg(II) and N-donors was also substantiated from the
significant increase in N 1s BE from 401.02 eV of GGTI-g-TetraP1 to 401.45 eV and at the same time decrease in BE from 102.58/106.68
eV to 102.09/105.80 eV for Hg 4f7/2/Hg 4f5/2 in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. Moreover, shifting of
GGTI-g-TetraP1 specific O 1s peaks from 530.32, 532.35,
and 534.10 to 531.01, 532.66/533.50, and 534.58 eV in Hg-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure 3g) inferred the occurrence of coordinate bonds between O-center
and Hg(II), realized from the prevalent Hg–O str. at 460 cm–1 in FTIR. In fact, the appearance
of the O 1s peak at 532.66/533.50 eV supported the formation of BB/BC
complexation with Hg(II). Moreover, the significant change in low-dimensional
H-bonded water cluster was understood from the change in BE from 541.13
to 541.32 eV in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1, supported
from the FTIR analysis.

Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. The −COO– specific O 1s peak of GGTI-g-TetraP1 at 532.35
eV was shifted to 533.81 eV (Figure 3k) in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1, indicating
the prevalence of BB and BC interactions.1 Additionally, participation of −COOH/–COO– in strong bonding was also ascertained from the shifting of peaks
from 530.32 (>C=O) and 534.10 eV (−COOH) to 529.79/531.97 and 536.11 eV, respectively, during Cu(II)
adsorption (Figure 3k).2 In fact, Cu–O bond formation
could also be rationalized from the significant lowering of the characteristic
Cu 2p3/2/Cu 2p1/2 peaks from 935.50/953.70 eV
of pure Cu(NO3)2 to 933.07/953.02 eV in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure 3l). In this regard, the shake-up satellite band at 541.13
eV of O-atom (Table 3) was shifted to 540.69 eV, which indicated the possible alteration
in O 1s BE of −CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH, predominantly through the formation of strong H-bonds to induce
slightly bigger water clusters in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1.
Additionally, the shake-up satellite peak of Cu 2p3/2 was
obtained at 944.16 eV.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
The initial thermal
decomposition of GGTI-g-TetraP2 from 51 °C was
comparatively more rapid than GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure S5a), attributed to the faster elimination
of loosely adhered water molecules from more hydrophobic GGTI-g-TetraP2. In addition, greater conversion of amides to
imides played the pivotal role in drastic deterioration of the amide-populated
GGTI-g-TetraP2. Nevertheless, the thermoresistant
secondary amides hindered the conversion of amides to imides in GGTI-g-TetraPs. Notably, slightly accelerated decarboxylation
of GGTI-g-TetraP1 within 346–378 °C could
be attributed to the decomposition of higher extent of anhydrides,
produced via dehydration of more frequently available −COOH
in GGTI-g-TetraP1. However, the relatively inferior
thermal stability of GGTI-g-TetraP2 above 378 °C
could be anticipated from the decomposition of imide intermediates.
Finally, the higher residue (i.e., 30.68 wt %) for GGTI-g-TetraP1 than for GGTI-g-TetraP2 (i.e., 25.02 wt
%) (Figure S5a) was related to the presence
of a relatively higher amount of thermostable Na+ salts.

Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. At pHi >
pHPZC, considerable conversion of −COOH to −COO– destroyed the existing H-bonds of GGTI-g-TetraPs that resulted in slightly deteriorated thermal stabilities
of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs up to 210 °C (Figure S5b). However, beyond this, the thermal
stabilities of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs exceeded GGTI-g-TetraPs because of the formation of SrCO3-type
crystal chelates, leading to the restricted formation and decomposition
of anhydrides because of the lack of free −COO–/–COOH in GGTI-g-TetraPs. The strong binding
affinity of Sr(II) with −COO– was realized
from the elevated thermal stability of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1, as GGTI-g-TetraP1 was immensely populated
with −COO–. The huge residues of 44.29 and
39.97 wt % for Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 and Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 (Figure S5b), respectively,
were attributed to the formation of extremely thermostable SrCO3 crystals.

Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. Though
Hg(II) adsorption
brought about significant alterations in the thermograms of GGTI-g-TetraPs, the initial decomposition pattern of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs resembled GGTI-g-TetraPs up to
100 °C (Figure S5c) because of the
lesser tendency of Hg(II) to interact with water. The greater mass
loss up to 169 °C from Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2
was ascribed to the higher hydrophobic character of GGTI-g-TetraP2. However, sharp decomposition of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 than GGTI-g-TetraP1 within 100–317
°C could be explained by the rapid rupture of thermolabile Hg–N
bonds, accompanied by the liberation of volatile Hg(II) components.
Furthermore, the preferential interaction of Hg(II) with N-donating
NIPA moieties and deprotonation of −COOH destroyed the mutual
O–H···N–H H-bonds to restore free N–H
of NIPA, which were converted into imides in the bulk of GGTI-g-TetraP1. Notably, as compared to Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2, the drastic degradation of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 could be explained by the relative enhancement of N-donors
in GGTI-g-TetraP2 that produced more Hg–N
bonds and >N–Hg–N< cross-links in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2, as observed from FTIR analyses. Finally, the
sharp decomposition of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs above
324 °C was mainly associated with the vaporization of adsorbed
Hg(II) components and decomposition of imides, anhydrides, and polymeric
backbone. In fact, vaporization of Hg(II) components significantly
lowered the amount of residues, that is, 0.005 and 9.17 wt % for Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 and Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 (Figure S5c), respectively, as Hg(II) eliminated
a larger amount of Na+ from GGTI-g-TetraPs.
Moreover, the higher residue content for Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 could be attributed to the delayed detachment of volatile
Hg(II) components from the relatively well cross-linked GGTI-g-TetraP2.

Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs.
Deprotonation of a significant
amount of −COOH into −COO– during
the adsorption of Cu(II) at alkaline pHi led to the appreciable
destruction of mutual O–H···N–H H-bonds
in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. Thus, Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs were thermally less stable than GGTI-g-TetraPs (Figure S5d). Moreover, the higher
mass loss of Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 over Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 within 100 °C could be attributed to the
removal of a higher number of water molecules from malachite-type
crystals, deposited significantly onto GGTI-g-TetraP1.
In fact, such deposition was also realized from the extended loss
of coordinated water up to 400 °C bearing one-step mass loss
of Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. The amount of residue was
found to be higher for Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 (i.e.,
18.73 wt %) than for Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (i.e.,
13.93 wt %) (Figure S5d), though adsorption
should be higher onto GGTI-g-TetraP1. This obscurity
could be contributed by the greater elimination of moisture during
the initial stage.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Analysis
The
prevalence of a broad and intense peak at 72 °C of GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure S5e) was related
to the vaporization of moisture and loosely adhered volatile components.
However, comparatively more intense and sharp endothermic peak at
77 °C in GGTI-g-TetraP2 could be attributed
to the easier removal of moisture and volatile components from the
more hydrophobic surface of GGTI-g-TetraP2 (Figure S5f), evidenced earlier from TGAs (Figure S5a). Such a broader peak in GGTI-g-TetraP1, constituted of a shoulder at 202 °C, could
be ascribed to the greater extent of anhydride formation via dehydration
of frequently available neighboring −COOH in GGTI-g-TetraP2. The absence of a shoulder at 202 °C was related to
the lower population of −COOH in GGTI-g-TetraP1,
whereas the exclusive appearance of an endothermic peak at 291 °C
was corroborated with the conversion of secondary amides into imides.
Consequently, another sharp peak at 357 °C, found exclusively
in GGTI-g-TetraP1, was related to the decarboxylation
of anhydrides. Moreover, the broad peak centered at 432 °C, originated
by the decomposition of imides, was more intense for GGTI-g-TetraP2, owing to the greater relative population of poly-NIPA-type
moieties, which showed a characteristic sharp degradation peak at
371 °C. Consequently, the fewer availability of such moieties
resulted in the absence of such peaks in GGTI-g-TetraP1.
Nevertheless, disappearance of the TetraP specific endothermic peak
at 134 °C in both GGTI-g-TetraPs indicated the
existence of strong H-bonds in GGTI-g-TetraPs, realized
earlier from FTIR analyses.

Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. The greater hydrophobicity of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2
resulted in a more rapid removal of moisture as compared to that of
Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure S5e,f). Though the DSC thermogram of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 is constituted of distinct peaks at 70, 195, 258, and 350
°C, which are assigned to moisture removal, anhydride formation,
amide formation, and amide to imide transition, respectively, the
thermogram of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 exhibited a broad
peak centered at 95 °C and a shoulder extended up to 350 °C
because of the decomposition of Sr(II) complexes containing both carboxyl
and amide ligands. A broad and intense peak centered at 405 °C
was ascribed to the breakdown of imides in thermally less stable Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2.

Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs.
In comparison to Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1, the relatively
intense and broad endothermic
transition in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 at 105 °C
(Figure S5e,f) could be related to the
rapid moisture loss from the relatively hydrophobic surface of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 than Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1, as
manifested in TGA (Figure S5c). Moreover,
the existence of a distinct endothermic peak at 176 °C in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 was associated with dehydration during anhydride
formation. The two new exothermic peaks within 200–220 °C
in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs were originated because
of the possible displacement reaction between adsorbed HgCl2/Hg(OH)2 and Al pan. However, within 235–350 °C,
the relatively less intense and broader endothermic transition for
Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 could be assigned to the higher
population of Hg–N bonds and >N–Hg–N< cross-links,
produced through the higher amount of N-donating NIPA in GGTI-g-TetraP2. Thus, the sharp endothermic peak at 279 °C
in GGTI-g-TetraP1 became broader and shifted to 327
°C in GGTI-g-TetraP2, indicating restricted
amide to imide transition in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2.
Thus, greater involvement of adsorbed Hg(II) in generating Hg–N
and >N–Hg–N< restricted the extent of the displacement
reaction between Hg(II) and Al pan, to produce a relatively truncated
exothermic peak within 200–220 °C.

Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. The characteristic intense
and broad peak of GGTI-g-TetraP1 at 72 °C was
significantly enhanced to 91 °C in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure S5e), suggesting restricted
removal of loosely held moisture and volatile components from the
relatively ordered and cross-linked network of Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. Such an endothermic peak was further broadened
and shifted to 144 °C in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2
that could be explained by the relatively easier removal of bound
water from adsorbed malachite-type crystals and amorphous Cu(II) components
(Figure S5f). The higher population of
−COO– encouraged higher accumulation of Cu(II)
components onto GGTI-g-TetraP1 via complexation of
O-donors with Cu(II) in various coordination modes (Table 1), leading to the exclusive
arrival of a small endothermic peak at 258 °C in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. Furthermore, the greater amide content in GGTI-g-TetraP2 and lesser coordination of Cu(II) with N-donors
resulted in relatively intense amide decomposition-related transitions
at lower temperature. Accordingly, the exclusive peak of Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 at 300 °C, originated through amide to imide
transformation, was not prominent in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1. Furthermore, the peaks at 379 and 424 °C for Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 could be compared with the glass-transition temperatures
of 349.8 and 412.2 °C for Cu(II)-adsorbed polyacrylate-based
IPN, respectively. However, such peaks were merged together with the
enthalpy change related to the decomposition of intermediate imide
to produce a broad and intense peak centered at 397 °C in Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2.

X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
The characteristic
peaks at 2θ = 21.13°/23.48° and 19.29°/21.04°/22.09°
(Figure S6a) for TetraP1 and TetraP2, respectively,
broadened in GGTI-g-TetraP1 and disappeared in GGTI-g-TetraP2. In spite of GGTI incorporation in the network,
the decrease in crystallinity of GGTI-g-TetraPs indicated
the extensive loss of orderliness during grafting. In fact, such loss
in the crystallinity of GGTI after grafting indicated the intimate
mixing between GGTI and TetraPs. In this context, extensive surface
reconstruction for GGTI-g-TetraPs was understood
via the appearance of new peaks at 2θ = 22.85°/22.16°
in GGTI-g-TetraP1/2 (Figure S6a), respectively. Again, the appearance of a GGTI specific weak shoulder
at 2θ = 42.32°/40.08° in GGTI-g-TetraP1/2,
respectively, supported the incorporation of GGTI. The better intermixing
of GGTI with more hydrophilic TetraP1 was ascertained through the
enhancement of crystallinity of TetraP2/GGTI-g-TetraP2
than TetraP1/GGTI-g-TetraP1.

Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. The appearance of numerous highly crystalline peaks and the loss
of GGTI-g-TetraP1 specific peaks in Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 supported extensive surface accumulation of Sr(II)
components. The peaks at 2θ = 26.34°, 30.54°, 45.69°,
47.11°, and 51.96° (Figure S6c) for (1,1,1), (0,0,2), (2,0,2), (1,3,2), and (1,1,3), respectively,
were similar to the characteristic planes of highly crystalline SrCO3.45 Again, the crystallographic
bond lengths closely matched with c1-, c2-, d1-, and d2-type bond
lengths of SrCO3 (Scheme S3),46 indicating that surface deposition of SrCO3-type crystals occurred because of the conversion of Sr(NO3)2 to SrCO3 in an alkaline medium.47 In addition, peaks at 2θ = 28.52°,
33.01°, 40.47°, 51.96°, 59.74°, 64.69°, 71.59°,
75.39°, and 80.63° (Figure S6c) supported direct surface deposition of Sr(NO3)2. Again, the formation and surface occupation of Sr(II) carboxylate-type
crystals were inferred from the arrival of new characteristic peaks
at 2θ = 24.03°, 33.90°, 38.19°, 42.62°,
and 44.73° (Figure S6c). Several new
crystalline peaks at 2θ = 27.34°, 30.34°, 33.05°,
and 44.49° (Figure S6d) appeared in
the XRD of Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2, along with the
retention of GGTI-g-TetraP2 specific peaks. However,
the lower intensity of such peaks than Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 indicated lesser surface deposition of Sr(NO3)2, SrCO3, and Sr(II) carboxylate because of
lowering of −COO– in GGTI-g-TetraP2.

Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. The crystalline
peaks of
both GGTI-g-TetraPs disappeared in Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs, indicating substantial alteration of the hydrogel
surface (Figure S6a,b). Though the XRD
diagram of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs did not contain
any characteristic peaks, the overall intensities of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 were slightly higher than that of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure S6b). This
observation indicated the prevalence of a higher amount of Hg(II)
on the surface of GGTI-g-TetraP2 because bulky NIPA
moieties predominantly resided at the surface of GGTI-g-TetraP1, realized from FTIR analyses.

Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. The diffractogram of Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs showed
several new peaks of variable intensities
at 2θ = 15.03°, 19.02°, 21.83°, 24.10°,
and 40.93° (shoulder) for Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1
and 20.87°, 22.06°, 23.87°, and 39.65° (shoulder)
for Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP2 (Figure S6b) and envisaged the presence of malachite-type crystals
at the surface of Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs.30 In fact, the surface deposition of Cu(II) onto
GGTI-g-TetraPs was apprehended by the significant
increase in the crystallinity of GGTI-g-TetraPs.

Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Spectrometry (EDX) Analyses
The FESEM microphotographs
of TetraP1 showed distinct phase boundaries, whereas the surface of
GGTI-g-TetraP1 was devoid of such distinct phase
boundaries (Figure S7a,b) and possessed
featureless, smooth, well-organized, and compact morphology because
of effective intermixing of grafted GGTI with TetraP1. The FESEM images
of Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure S7e) showed the deposition of tabular and prismatic crystals
of malachite Cu(II), apprehended earlier from FTIR and XRD analyses.
From the EDX spectrum (inset of Figure S7e), the appearance of different intense peaks supported variegated
interactions with GGTI-g-TetraP1 through ionic/coordinate
bonding. Again, the appearance of uneven and heterogeneous surface
of Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 (Figure S7d) indicated either bulk diffusion or surface occupation
of amorphous Hg(II) salts. The formation of covalent, coordinate,
and/or ionic bonds between GGTI-g-TetraP1 and Hg(II)
was eventually realized from the appearance of variegated Hg(II) peaks
in EDX (inset of Figure S7d). For Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1, extensive surface deposition of various crystals
was observed (Figure S7c). In fact, the
existence of SrCO3, Sr(NO3)2, and
Sr(II) carboxylate types of crystals on the surface of GGTI-g-TetraP1 was already established by XRD analyses.

Rheological
Analysis
From Figure S8, a significant increase in the storage modulus with the
increase in frequency from 0 to 40 rad s–1 was noted
for GGTI-g-TetraP1, followed by the gradual decrease
in storage modulus within 40–100 rad s–1.
In contrast, the loss modulus increased up to 4 rad s–1 and then reduced marginally with further increase in frequency.
However, no crossover between storage and loss moduli was observed
from 0 to 100 rad s–1. The higher storage as compared
to loss modulus indicated stable, compact, and strong GGTI-g-TetraP network, generated via extensive physical and chemical
cross-linking.

Adsorption Isotherm, Kinetics, and Thermodynamics
Studies
The interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent
was realized
by fitting of the experimental data with different isotherm models
(eqs S1–S3), of which the Langmuir
model (Figure S9a–f) fitted the
best (Table 4). Thus,
the prevalence of monolayer adsorption on the structurally homogeneous
adsorbent surface was realized. Alongside, the nonprevalent interaction
between unadsorbed and already adsorbed M(II) was understood via the
presence of electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged
M(II).2 The enhancement of qmax with the increasing temperature suggested chemisorption
between M(II) and GGTI-g-TetraPs, supported from
the inferences of FTIR and XPS analyses. The ligand selectivity of
GGTI-g-TetraPs for M(II) adsorption was rationalized
from the qmax values in the following
order: Sr(II) (1940.24 mg g–1) > Cu(II) (1903.64
mg g–1) > Hg(II) (1759.50 mg g–1) for GGTI-g-TetraP1, but Hg(II) (1848.03 mg g–1) > Cu(II) (1781.63 mg g–1) >
Sr(II)
(1748.36 mg g–1) for GGTI-g-TetraP2.
The higher binding affinity of Hg(II) with N-center elevated the adsorption
capacity (AC) for NIPA-populated GGTI-g-TetraP2.
In this regard, separation factor (RL)
and a dimensionless quantity (eq S4), measuring
the feasibility of adsorption (RL >
1,
0 < RL < 1, RL = 1, and RL = 0 indicate unfavorable,
favorable, linear, and irreversible adsorptions, respectively), were
found to vary within 0–1, indicating favorable adsorption.

The adsorption mechanism, that is, physisorption or chemisorption,
was studied through fitting of kinetics data to the pseudo-first-/-second-order
kinetics models (Figure S9g–l).
The extent of adsorption deteriorated gradually with advancement of
adsorption because of gradual reduction in the number of free sites
onto hydrogels. Better fitting of pseudo-second-order kinetics (eq S6) than pseudo-first-order (eq S5) indicated the prevalence of chemisorption48 (Table 4) through ionic and variegated coordinative interactions (i.e.,
M, BB, and BC) between −COO– of GGTI-g-TetraPs and M(II). The pseudo-second-order rate constants
(k2) for both M(II) were found to increase
with the rise in temperature in GGTI-g-TetraPs, indicating
faster adsorption at the relatively higher temperatures. The activation
energies (Ea) of adsorption, calculated
using the Arrhenius-type equation (eq S7), were as follows: 37.35/21.28, 16.85/20.51, and 26.24/25.29 kJ
mol–1 for Sr(II), Hg(II), and Cu(II) adsorption
onto GGTI-g-TetraP1/2, respectively, indicating the
prevalence of chemisorption.49

The
spontaneity of the chemisorption was inferred by observing
negative ΔG0 (eq S8) for all M(II).50 Again,
the exothermic nature of adsorption was comprehended by the negative
ΔH0 (Table 5), as calculated by van’t Hoff’s eq S10, whereas the positive ΔS0 suggested fair affinity of M(II) for both GGTI-g-TetraPs and the decrease in randomness at the solid–solution
interface during adsorption (Figure S10).

Swelling and pH Reversibility of GGTI-g-TetraPs
The swelling studies of hydrogels were
performed in solutions of
pHi = 2, 4, 7, 9, and 12 at 313 K (Figures S11a,b and S12a,b). The gradual increment of ESR was
observed from pHi = 2 to 9 because of the increasing electrostatic
repulsion between the relatively higher population of −COO– in the macromolecular network. Therefore, in acidic
pHi, shrinking and associated poor swelling were observed
because of the predominant population of −COOH. The maximum
swelling was observed at pHi = 9 for both TetraPs and GGTI-g-TetraPs. Moreover, at very high pHi, that is,
pHi = 12, instead of complete dissociation of functional
groups, formation of a remarkably high concentration of counterions
acted as a screening layer because of the reduction in ion–ion
repulsion, and thus, lower ESR was noted. Interestingly, in spite
of getting the maximum swelling at pHi = 9, M(II) adsorption
was carried out at pHi = 7 for avoiding the precipitation
of M(OH)2. The higher ESR of GGTI-g-TetraPs
than TetraPs was attributed to the incorporation of GGTI bearing −COOH/–COO– and O–H/O–. The swelling
experiments were also carried out at 293, 303, 313, 323, and 333 K
at pHi = 7 (Figures S11c,d and S12c,d), and ESR was found to increase with the rise in temperature. The
pH reversibility of both TetraPs and GGTI-g-TetraPs
was understood via performing repeating swelling–deswelling
studies at pHi = 9 and pHi = 2 (Figure 4a). A 0.01 g xerogel was first
dipped into pHi = 9 to attain the equilibrium, followed
by immersing into pHi = 2 for 1 h to effect deswelling.
Such swelling–deswelling studies were continued for several
cycles. Notably, TetraPs became fragile after three complete cycles,
whereas GGTI-g-TetraPs exhibited the retention of
network even up to five complete cycles (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 (a) pH reversibility swelling and (b) reusability
of TetraPs and
GGTI-g-TetraPs.

Calculation of % GC, % GR, % −COOH, and pHPZC of GGTI-g-TetraPs
The % GC, % GR, % −COOH,
and pHPZC of GGTI-g-TetraPs were estimated
using the methods reported elsewhere.1−3 However, the values were
found to be 78.89/76.32%, 3.07/3.12%, 9.23/5.54%, and 6.38/5.88 (Figure S13), respectively.

Desorption
and Reusability
The recyclability of GGTI-g-TetraPs was studied by carrying out repetitive adsorption/desorption
studies at pHi = 9/2 (Figure 4b). The extent of desorption was approximately
90% for Sr(II)-/Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs, whereas the
extent of desorption was within 80–85% for Hg(II)-GGTI-g-TetraPs. The excellent reusability of GGTI-g-TetraPs could be explained by observing brilliant ACs in the successive
rates of adsorption even after five cycles.

Comparison of the Results
Several low-cost natural,
physically and/or chemically modified micro-/nanomaterials, blends,
homo-/co-/terpolymers, IPN, and composite hydrogels have been employed
for the adsorptive remediation of Sr(II), Hg(II), and Sb(III) at varying
initial concentrations (i.e., 5–3800 ppm), temperatures (i.e.,
293–323 K), and pHi (i.e., 1.0–10.6) (Table S3). According to Table S3, the maximum reported ACs were 303, 192.50, and 70.92 mg
g–1 for Sr(II), Hg(II), and Sb(II), respectively.
However, the maximum ACs of GGTI-g-TetraPs are greater
than 1700 mg g–1, in spite of the identical experimental
conditions (Table S3), which are significantly
larger than the previously reported adsorbents. Such marked enhancement
of ACs has been called as superadsorption.

Conclusions
The
present work describes the unusual development of a series
of versatile and sustainable GGTI-g-TetraP-based
superadsorbents with a tetrapolymeric network constituting of in situ
generated NMPAP and AMP moieties by N–H and C–H activations,
along with the formation of CH2–O–CH2 linkage via grafting of GGTI onto TetraP. The inclusion of
NMPAP in the TetraP was confirmed from the arrival of N–CH2 specific 1H/13C NMR peaks at 3.49–3.53/39.75
ppm, along with the appearance of the shake-up satellite band of −CH2(Cq)CON((Cq)(Me2)−)CH2(Cq)COOH. In situ generation of
AMP, through the conversion of the tertiary carbon of −CH(CH3)2 into the quaternary carbon of
−(Cq)(CH3)2–,
was comprehensively ascertained from the quaternary carbon specific 13C NMR peaks at 46.15 and 52.03 ppm in GGTI-g-TetraP and subsequent obsolescence of these peaks in DEPT-135. Extensive
deposition of Sr(NO3)2, SrCO3, and
Sr carboxylate-type crystals onto the Sr(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1 surface was established from the appearance of distinct
XRD peaks, also substantiated from the respective FESEM and abnormally
high residue content (i.e., 44.29 wt %) in TGA, whereas formation
of malachite-type crystals on Cu(II)-GGTI-g-TetraP1
was detected from the characteristic XRD peaks and FTIR. The introduction
of this new pathway can be adopted for the synthesis of NMPAP and
AMP-based tetrapolymers, without orthodox ex situ addition of NMPAP,
AMP, or derivatives. GGTI-g-TetraP, showing excellent
recyclability, performance characteristics, and outstanding adsorption
efficiency, has shown the novelty in a kinetically fast decontamination
process.
