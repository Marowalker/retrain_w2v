Copper
oxide nanoparticles (CuO Nps) were synthesized using Caesalpinia bonducella seed extract via a green synthetic
pathway and were evaluated for electrocatalytic properties by carrying
out electrochemical detection of riboflavin [vitamin B2 (VB2)]. The seeds of C. bonducella are known to have strong antioxidant properties arising due to the
presence of various components, including citrulline, phytosterinin,
β-carotene, and flavonoids, which serve as reducing, stabilizing,
and capping agents. The synthesized CuO Nps were characterized using
UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
thermogravimetrc analysis–differential thermal analysis, X-ray
diffraction spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning
electron microscopy and further used as a modifier for a graphite
electrode surface. The modified electrode was electrochemically characterized
by cyclic voltammetry, square-wave voltammetry, and chronoamperometry
techniques and then assessed for electrocatalysis by carrying out
the detection of VB2. The electrochemical sensor could
be used for nanomolar detection of VB2 with an observed
linear range of 3.13–56.3 nM with a limit of detection of 1.04
nM. The electrode showed good stability and reproducibility over a
period of 120 days. The CuO Nps were further analyzed for antibacterial
effect with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and in both
cases, high antibacterial activity was clearly observed. The newly
synthesized nanoparticles, thus, proved to be an interesting material
for electrochemical and biological studies.

Introduction
Metal nanoparticles (Nps) find applications
in microelectronics, sensors, catalysis, and various areas of nanotechnology.1 These particles are found to have advantages
arising due to their small size, large surface area, chemical and
optical properties, and good electrical conductivity. Among them,
copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO Nps) have acquired great interest
in research fields, such as solar cells,2 biodiesel,3 photocatalysis,4 water pollutant removal,5 supercapacitors,6 electrocatalysis,7 etc., due to their desirable properties, such
as low cost, nontoxicity, and easy preparation.6 The number of electrocatalytic applications of CuO Nps
has been limited in spite of the methods offering improved sensitivity
and selectivity and being more economical.

CuO Nps have been
synthesized by various methods, including microwave irradiation,8 precipitation pyrolysis,9 and thermal decomposition.10 However,
the green synthesis of CuO Nps offers distinct advantages. Green chemistry
is sustainable chemistry, used to minimize the generation of hazardous
substances.11 Green synthesis of MO Nps
is one of the simplest and ecofriendly methods, among which plant-mediated
synthesis has attracted attention owing to its nontoxicity and also
being an economical and facile process.12 Some of the recent reports on synthesis of CuO Nps using plant sources
include the use of Saraca indica with
fluorescence properties,13Aglaia elaeagnoidea with catalytic and recyclability
properties,4Fortunella
japonica for electrocatalytic detection of 4-nitrophenol,14Rheum palmatum L. root extract for catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol,15Madhuca longifolia for waste water treatment,16 Tridaxprocumbens
leaf extract for mosquito larvicidal activity,17 and synthesis of ultrasmall copper nanoparticles using
lemongrass tea extract.18

We have
synthesized CuO Nps using Caesalpinia bonducella seed extract. The other prevalent names for C. bonducella include bonduc nut, fevernut, or molucca bean and is a medicinal
plant widely found in Sri Lanka and India. The various parts of the
plant have been found to have therapeutic uses including antioxidant,19 antihyperglycaemic,20 antihyerlipidemic,21 anti-inflammatory,22 anticonvulsive,23 antifilarial,24 antibacterial,25 antifungal,26 antidiabetic,27 and diuretic functions.28 The seeds of C. bonducella are reported
to have strong antioxidant properties29 and contain various chemical compounds, including citrulline, phytosterinin,
β-carotene, flavonoids, bonducellin, aspartic acid, β-sitosterol,
arginine, and furanoditerpenes.30 These
components could serve as reducing, stabilizing, and capping agents.
Due to the vast application possibilities, nanoparticle synthesis
using the seed extract was carried out, and since copper has interesting
biological and electrical conduction properties, we have chosen it
for this work.

Riboflavin [vitamin B2 (VB2)] is a central module for coenzymes, such as flavin adenine dinucleotide
(FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and plays an essential role
in the sequence of protein, carbohydrate and fat metabolism. It is
a water-soluble vitamin necessary for human health, and it is very
much required for the proper functioning of human organs, but an excess
of riboflavin is hazardous to human health, leading to oxidative damage
to DNA and tissue when exposed to UV radiation.31 Meanwhile, lack of VB2 leads to skin disorders
and eye lesions. Most importantly, it cannot be produced by the human
body; instead it is provided through dietary supplements and medicinal
products.32 Therefore, it is essential
to monitor and determine VB2 in situ in real samples. In
the past few years, various methods have been used to determine VB2, such as high-performance liquid chromatography,33 microbiological methods,34 fluorescence spectroscopy,35 and so on. Even though these methods are highly sensitive and selective,
they have certain demerits, such as the high cost, portability issues,
and tedious sample preparation. Hence, it is essential to explore
sensitive, selective, and low-cost instrumentation. Electrochemical
techniques have many attractive properties, such as simplicity, low
cost, speed, a wide linear range, low detection limit, high stability,
and minimal space and power requirements. They have found a broad
range of applications in various fields, including clinical,36 industrial,37 environmental,38 and agricultural analyses.39 Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles have been applied for
catalytic applications, e.g., polychitosan gold nanoparticles were
employed for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol,40 CuO Nps were used for electrocatalytic glucose sensing application,41 copper cobaltite nanoplates were applied for
electrochemical determination of acetylcholine,42 copper oxide nanosheets have been applied for the electrochemical
simultaneous detection of environmentally hazardous anions,43 heterostructural CuO–ZnO nanocomposites
were used for the electrochemical determination of NO2,44 a CuO nanoparticle-inkjet-printed electrode
was employed for glucose sensing,45 etc.
CuO Nps were also shown to exhibit good catalytic efficiency when
compared to cobalt or nickel nanoparticles.46 CuO Nps are a well-known p-type semiconductor with a direct band
gap, which has excellent electrical properties, and these semiconducting
metal oxides have gained immense attention in electrochemical sensing
because of their chemical stability, valence variation, and excellent
electrocatalytic activity.47,48

In this study,
novel CuO Nps using C. bonducella seed
extract were synthesized and used as an electrocatalyst toward sensing
VB2. The synthesized nanoparticles were evaluated using
UV–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetrc analysis–differential
thermal analysis (TGA–DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and electrochemical studies, and the antibacterial properties
of CuO Nps were established evidently.

Results and Discussion
The major approach of this work was to make use of C. bonducella seed extract to convert Cu2+ ions to CuO Nps. Flavonoids present in the seed extract can precisely
search for the active oxygen species (ROS). The flavanoids have the
ability to donate the hydrogen or electron, and the phenolics exhibit
a chelating effect on the metal ions,49 which is responsible for the reduction of Cu2+ from Cu(NO3)2·3H2O to copper oxide nanoparticles.50 The formation of the latter was confirmed by
SEM, UV–vis, FT-IR, TGA and DTA, XRD, and XPS techniques.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy
The structural features of the synthesized
particles were investigated using field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM). The observed images at different magnifications
are shown in Figure 1a,b. The nanostructured particles apparently exhibit a rice-grain-shaped
morphology. The images show that the copper nanoparticles are evenly
distributed and homogeneous in nature. This result is similar to those
in previous reports on the morphology of Cu Nps and CuO Nps.51,52 The elemental composition of the prepared nanoparticles shows prominently
larger peaks for copper (Cu) and oxygen (O) and much smaller peaks
corresponding to impurities, aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), iron (Fe),
and nickel (Ni). The weight percentage of copper and oxygen was calculated
to be 73.15 and 22.17%, respectively. The strong and narrow diffraction
peaks of CuO Nps suggest that the resultant particles are highly crystalline
in nature.

UV–Vis Absorption Spectroscopy for
Copper Oxide Nanoparticles
Formation of CuO Nps was initially
confirmed using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. Figure 2 clearly shows a sharp absorption
peak, corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for CuO
Nps at 250 nm.53 This is attributed to
the oscillation of surface conduction electrons, which are excited
by the incident electromagnetic radiation. Another weak and broad
spectrum in the range of 320–600 nm was also observed, attributed
to the SPR band of some Cu colloid formations of the nonoxidized Cu
Nps.54

Figure 2 UV–vis spectra of CuO Nps.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy
FT-IR analysis was carried out to detect the probable biomolecules
that are responsible for the formation of CuO Nps. Figure 3 represents the FT-IR spectrum
of CuO Nps recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm–1. As observed, a strong peak around 3427 cm–1 corresponds
to the −OH stretching of phenolic compounds present in the
seed extract, and the band at 1635 cm–1 corresponds
to the C=O stretching of ketones or acids.55 The fine peak at 2923 cm–1 was attributed
to the alkane C–H stretching mode.15 The sharp peak around 1405 cm–1 shows the presence
of −COO carboxylic acid and the absorption peak at 1103 cm–1 corresponds to the C–NH2 primary
aliphatic amines present in the seed extract.14 The narrow bands at 457, 526, 600, and 784 cm–1 confirm the formation of pure CuO Nps.56 This indicates that the biological molecule in the seed extract
has a dual function of stabilization and formation of CuO Nps.57

Figure 3 FT-IR spectra of CuO Nps.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
TGA was carried out to further
characterize the nanoparticles. Figure 4a represents the TGA curve of CuO Nps on heating from
0 to 800 °C under oxygen. The TGA curve exhibits the two-step
decomposition of CuO Nps, with weight loss occurring in the temperature
ranges of 80–130 and 260–400 °C. The former weight
loss is attributed to the removal of moisture content, and the latter
is due to the combustion of the organic solvent compound, and COx (x = 1, 2) or organic gases
will be left over. Figure 4b shows a minor endothermic DTA peak around the region of
130 °C, which corresponds to the first mass loss in the TGA curve.
The second major mass loss occurring around 260–400 °C
in TGA is associated with a prominent DTA exothermic peak around the
region of 265 °C.56

CuO Nps.

X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Crystallography
To investigate the crystallographic nature
and phase purity of the synthesized CuO Nps, XRD analysis was performed,
as shown in Figure 5. Major diffraction peaks occurring at the 2θ values of 34.3,
38.7, 48.7, 51.3, 58.2, 61.5, 65.8 were assigned to (0,0,2), (1,1,1),
(2,0,−2), (1,1,2), (2,0,2), (1,1,−3), and (0,2,2) miller
indices plane. A sharp peak at 2θ = 38.7° with the diffraction
of the (111) plane corresponds to CuO Nps, which indicates that they
are monoclinic crystals with the space group of C2/c (15). XRD analysis illustrates that the synthesized
CuO Nps are monoclinic and crystalline in nature. The assigned lattice
parameters are a = 4.6883 Å, b = 3.4229 Å, and c = 5.1319 Å, and these
values agreed well with the standard JCPDS No. 00-048-1548. The size
of the crystalline nanoparticles was enumerated using the Debye–Scherrer
formula for the maximum intensity peak10  where λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.1546 nm),
β is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) (line broadening
at half-maximum) in radians, and θ is Bragg’s angle.
On the basis of the highest 2θ peak, we calculated the crystalline
size to be ca. 13.07 nm for CuO Nps. Also, due to the smaller crystalline
size, the XRD pattern appears noisy.

and the reference pattern of CuO Nps.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
The synthesized CuO
Nps were characterized by XPS analysis to understand the chemical
composition of the particles and is shown in Figure 6. The survey scan spectrum in Figure 6a shows peaks corresponding
to C 1s (59.9%), Cu2p3 (8.9%), and O 1s (31.2%). Figure 6b shows the corresponding
O 1s region. Figure 6c shows the strong C 1s spectra with high resolution. Figure 6d represents the strong Gaussian
fitting peak of Cu 2p in the range of 934–954 eV. The two peaks
around 943 and 963 eV are the corresponding satellite peaks.58 The peak at 934 eV with a lower binding energy
is assigned to CuO, corresponding to the Cu 2p3/2 state,
and the other peak at 954 eV corresponds to the Cu 2p1/2 state, which is similar to the result in earlier reports.59−61 The oxidation state of Cu was thus Cu(0), which can be easily oxidized
by atmospheric oxygen to Cu(I) or Cu(II) to form the CuO Nps.62

Nps, O 1s, C 1s, and Cu 2p.

Antibacterial Activity of CuO Nps
The antibacterial properties
of CuO Nps were examined against Staphylococcus aureus and Aeromonas. CuO Nps exhibited good properties
for inhibiting the bacterial growth; Figure 7 clearly shows the zone of clearance against
both the pathogens. It is revealed that CuO Nps showed better antibacterial
properties against S. aureus when compared
to Aeromonas. The antibacterial properties of CuO
nanoparticles might be due to the interaction between the rice-grain-shaped
nanoparticles with the bacterial surface, which easily leads to cell
damage due to the ripping of the bacterial cell wall.63 And the good activity seen toward Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria could be due to the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) from CuO. The obtained zone of inhibition was measured and presented
in Figure 8. The results
presented are the mean of three parallel experiments and are presented
as mean ± standard deviation.

Electrochemical Behaviour of a Copper Oxide Nanoparticle Modified
Electrode
A novel electrochemical sensor for the determination
of riboflavin was fabricated by incorporating CuO Nps into a paraffin-impregnated
graphite electrode (a CuO Nps/PIG-modified electrode). Cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) of the modified and unmodified electrodes were recorded in buffer
solution (pH 5), and the results are shown in Figure 9. A higher current was observed for the modified
electrode in comparison to the unmodified bare PIG electrode in the
presence of riboflavin. This indicated the modifier CuO Nps have a
good catalytic effect and faster electron transfer kinetics. The modified
electrode shows a redox peak with an Epa value of 0.1 V and an Epc value of −0.15
V, and a corresponding ΔEP value
of 0.25 V within a potential window of 0.4 to −0.4 V at a scan
rate of 50 mV s–1. The surface coverage concentration
of the modified electrode was found to be 7.4207 × 10–14 mol cm–2 using the equation  where Q is the charge, Γ is the surface coverage
(mol cm–2), n is the number of
transferred electrons, F is the Faraday constant
(96 485.3329 C mol–1), and A is the electrode surface area (cm2).

of bare and modified electrodes with 30 μM riboflavin in 0.1
M acetate buffer at pH 5.

Effect of pH on the Electrochemical Determination of Riboflavin
The effect of pH on the electrocatalysis of riboflavin by CuO Nps
under different pH conditions (3.0–8.0) was studied. The pH
was maintained using 0.1 M acetate or phosphate buffer solutions.
The voltammogram was recorded with the modified electrode as the working
electrode in 30 μM VB2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. Figure 10a shows the cyclic voltammograms for the oxidation of VB2 under different pH conditions. The maximum anodic peak current
was observed at a pH of 5. Above or below this pH, the peak current
was found to be reduced. The highest current response at pH 5 may
be due to two factors: the protonation of the acidic buffer (ABS)
at higher pH values and the fact that the redox mechanism of riboflavin
involves a proton, thus resulting in the reduction in current at higher
pH values. Hence, pH 5 was considered as optimum for further determination
of VB2 using the CuO-Np-modified electrode.

voltammograms obtained with the CuO Nps/PIG-modified electrode in
the presence of 30 μM riboflavin under different pH conditions
and (b) pH vs potential and (c) pH vs current plot.

Figure 10b shows the plot of pH vs anodic potential Epa (V) for riboflavin oxidation, which gives a linear response
with correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9698. Figure 10c represents the
plot of pH vs current I (μA).

Effect of
Scan Rate
A scan rate study plays a significant role in the
rate and kinetic studies of electrochemical reactions. To analyze
the nature of the electrocatalytic action of the CuO Nps/PIG-modified
electrode on VB2 reduction, the effect of scan rate on
the anodic peak potential and current was investigated in the presence
of 50 μM VB2 at scan rates ranging from 50 to 250
mV s–1 in a pH 5 acetate buffer solution. As shown
in Figure 11a, the
anodic and cathodic peak current increases gradually with increasing
scan rates and the anodic peak potential shifts toward the positive
side, which suggests the redox process to be quasireversible.49 The potential shift is due to the kinetic limitation,
wherein the active species and electrolyte ions get enough time to
interact with each other at a lower scan rate, but the interaction
was not good enough at a higher scan rate. The corresponding plots
of the observed current (for both anodic and cathodic peaks) vs scan
rate are clearly shown in Figure 11b. The obtained correlation coefficient for the anodic
current (Ipa) R2 = 0.9776 and for the cathodic current (Ipc) R2 = 0.9292. The plot shows very good
linearity, where the slope value is close to 1, and this confirms
that the electron transfer reaction is a diffusion-controlled process.64

The electrocatalytic redox reaction of VB2 involves two
protons coupled with two electrons.65Figure 12 exhibits the possible
mechanism of VB2 reduction at the CuO-Np-modified electrode

redox mechanism for VB2 on the CuO-Np-modified electrode.

Determination of Riboflavin: Cyclic Voltammetry
Study
VB2 was added into the electrolyte solution
containing 0.1 M ABS of pH 5, and the voltammogram was recorded with
the CuO-modified PIG electrode as the working electrode. The standard
addition method was used to ascertain the linearity and detection
limit for riboflavin oxidation at the modified electrode. The potential
was scanned in the region of −0.4 to 0.4 V at a scan rate of
50 mV s–1. Figure 13a shows the cyclic voltammograms for the VB2 redox process. The redox peak current is linearly enhanced with
an increase in VB2 concentration. A well-distinguished
anodic peak is observed at 0.1 V and a cathodic peak at −0.15
V. The observed redox process is a two-electron process with one electron
involved in the conversion of the oxidized flavin molecule to semiquinone
and another electron in the conversion of half reduced dihydroflavin
to a fully reduced dihydroflavin molecule.49

Figure 13 (a, b) Cyclic voltammogram for the determination of VB2 and the corresponding calibration plot of anodic and cathodic peak
currents vs concentration of VB2.

The obtained linear range for VB2 is from 6.27 ×
10–7 to 75 × 10–7 M with
a detection limit of 2 × 10–7 M. Figure 13b shows the calibration
plot for VB2. A linear response was observed with a correlation
coefficient of 0.9725. The results illustrated the good electrocatalytic
activity of the CuO-modified PIG electrode.

Determination of Riboflavin:
Square-Wave Voltammetry (SWV) Study
The electrocatalysis
of VB2 at the CuO-modified PIG electrode was studied using
SWV, as it is a more sensitive technique for such an analysis. VB2 was added into the electrolyte solution in the volume range
of 5–90 μL, and voltammograms were recorded within a
potential window of −0.2 to 0.3 V, as shown in Figure 14a. A sharp distinct peak was
observed around 0.03 V, the current values for which were enhanced
on increasing the VB2 concentration. Figure 14b shows the calibration plot
for VB2 exhibiting linear dependency. The linearity was
found to be from 3.13 to 56.3 nM with a detection limit of 1.04 nM.
The corresponding correlation coefficient was R2 = 0.9760.

electrode for VB2 oxidation with the corresponding calibration

Chronoamperometric and
Impedance Study
To determine the operating potential for
amperometric detection of VB2 at the CuO-modified PIG electrode,
a hydrodynamic study was carried out. Based on the study, an operating
potential of 0.1 V was chosen as the optimum for carrying out the
reduction of VB2 at the modified electrode. Figure 15a shows the chronoamperogram
obtained for the reduction of VB2 on the CuO-modified PIG
electrode at a fixed potential of 0.1 V under stirring conditions
of 300 rpm in 0.1 M ABS, pH 5. With successive additions of VB2, the CuO-modified PIG electrode showed a stepwise increment
of the catalytic current with a linear range of 1.2 to 8.58 μM. Figure 15b shows the corresponding
calibration plot exhibiting linearity with a correlation coefficient
of R2 = 0.9646. Figure 15c shows the double-step chronoamperometric
result of the CuO-modified PIG electrode to investigate the electrocatalysis
of VB2 using a chemically modified electrode. The study
was carried out with a pH 5 electrolyte by standard addition of the
VB2 solution. The working potential was fixed at 0.1 V
for the first potential step and −0.1 V for the second potential
step. On increasing the concentration of VB2, the anodic
current increases for the first potential step and the cathodic current
increases for the second potential step; both steps consume equal
charge for oxidation and reduction of the redox couple in the CuO-modified
PIG electrode.66,67

Figure 15 (a–c) Chronoamperometric study
of VB2 reduction with the corresponding calibration plot
and double-step chronoamperogram of VB2 reduction and oxidation

Figure 16a shows
the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the bare and CuO-modified
PIG electrodes in the presence of 5 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– in 0.1 M KCl as the supporting electrolyte.
In the Nyquist diagram, the semicircle diameter shows the electron
transfer kinetics of the [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– redox scan on the electrode surface, which is equal to the electron
transfer resistance.68 The resistance of
the modified electrode is lower when compared to the bare electrode,
suggesting the lower resistance to electron transfer due to the electrocatalytic
effect of the CuO Nps. The impedance spectra fitted well with the
Randles circuit shown in Figure 16b. Rs (electrolyte resistance)
is connected with Rct (charge resistance)
and W (Warburg resistance), and it is parallel to Cdl (double-layer capacitance).69 It is clear that the CuO-modified PIG electrode provides
enhancement of the charge transfer efficiency when compared to the
bare electrode.70

impedance spectra (EIS) of the bare and modified electrodes and the
Randles equivalent circuit model.

The electrochemical response of the modified electrode for VB2 detection has been correlated with other electrochemical
methods reported in the literature. The comparison is presented in Table 1, which shows that
the CuO-modified PIG electrode exhibits an excellent linear range
and lower detection limit compared to previous reports.

Interference
An
important parameter for evaluating sensor performance is its ability
to distinguish any interfering compounds in relation to the analyte
of interest. To determine the selectivity of the CuO-modified PIG
electrode toward VB2, possible interfering species such
as glucose, ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid, salicylic acid, and
tartaric acid were added to the test solution. A 10-fold excess of
ascorbic acid and dopamine and a 50-fold excess of uric acid, salicylic
acid, tartaric acid, and glucose show minimal interference in detecting
VB2 and is shown in Figure 17. The result suggests the excellent selectivity
of the CuO-modified PIG electrode toward VB2 determination.

Stability and Reproducibility
The stability and reproducibility
of the proposed CuO-modified PIG electrode sensor were evaluated for
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 days using an
optimized experimental method. Figure 18 shows the current response of the CuO-modified
PIG electrode over a period of 120 days. Therefore, the mentioned
results indicate that the CuO-modified PIG electrode is a sensor with
good stability and reproducibility for the determination of VB2.

Real-Sample Analysis
The CuO-modified PIG electrode potential was evaluated for the
detection of VB2 in B-complex tablets, milk powder, and
egg yolk. The corresponding analytical parameters are presented in Table 2. The concentration
of VB2 was evaluated by the standard addition method, and
the recovery values range from 99 to 99.75%. The obtained result shows
that the proposed method can be employed for real-sample analysis.

Experimental
Methods
Chemicals
Cupric nitrate trihydrate [Cu(NO3)2·3H2O], riboflavin (C17H20N4O6), and ammonia (NH3)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Apparatus Required
All electrochemical experiments were performed on an electrochemical
workstation (CHI 6095E Instruments Austin, TX) with a conventional
three-electrode system, in which the paraffin-impregnated graphite
electrode (PIGE) was used as the working electrode, a platinum electrode
was employed as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) was used as the reference electrode. For the impedance study,
the applied potential was 0.3 V and was recorded with an amplitude
of 5 mV over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. All electrochemical
studies were carried out at room temperature (25 °C). The synthesized
compound was characterized by SEM, UV–vis, FT-IR, TGA and DTA,
XRD, and XPS techniques. SEM was recorded with a Quattro S Instrument,
ThermoFisher Scientific; FT-IR spectra were recorded with an AGILENT
Instrument; UV–vis spectra were recorded with a JAZ, Ocean
optics; TGA–DTA curves were recorded with a FTA2500 Instrument,
Netzsch; XRD spectra were recorded with a SmartLab SE X-Ray Instruments,
Rigaku; and XPS spectra were recorded with a ULVAC-PHI Versaprobe-II.
The details of the antibacterial studies are given below.

Preparation
of Seed Extract
The C. bonducella seed (bonduc seed) coat was removed, and the kernel was finely ground
using a mortar and pestle. About 0.5 mg of the ground seed was taken
in 50 mL of deionized water and allowed to sonicate for 30 min and
filtered.

Synthesis of Copper Oxide Nanoparticles
Various percentage
solutions of the seed extract, ammonia solution (25%), and 0.01 M
cupric nitrate trihydrate were used for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles.
The pH conditions were examined and optimized on the basis of the
obtained product yield. Briefly, 40 mL of the cupric solution was
taken in a 100 mL beaker and 40 μL of the freshly prepared seed
extract was added dropwise for carrying out the reduction of copper
ions, followed by the addition of 200 μL of ammonia solution
under constant stirring. The blue-colored solution turned green over
a period of 5 h, and finally, a dark brown precipitate formed at about
7 h, as shown in Scheme 1. The formation of the brown precipitate indicated the complete reduction
of copper ions and the formation of CuO Nps.13 The obtained solution was then centrifuged and washed several times
using deionized water, and the sample was heated at 450 °C for
an hour.

Scheme 1 Photographs Taken during the Formation of CuO Nanoparticles
Antibacterial Activity
The antibacterial properties of CuO Nps were investigated against S. aureus (Gram-positive) and Aeromonas (Gram-negative) bacteria by the agar diffusion method. Each bacterial
strain was smeared evenly on the sterilized agar Petri plates and
allowed to dry. Two wells each of ∼5 mm in diameter were made
on petri dish after inoculum of strain and 30 μL of CuO-NPs
were loaded in the wells.To observe the zone of clearance, the plates
were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and the zone of inhibition
was measured and photographed the next day.

Preparation of Real Samples
The egg was allowed to boil in a water bath for 6 min and the yolk
was taken separately. Then, 1 g of egg yolk was added to 20 mL of
0.02 M acetic acid and sonicated for 15 min at room temperature. The
extract was filtered using Whatman filter paper No. 1 (55 mm diameter).77 Vitamin B-complex tablets were purchased from
a local pharmaceutical store; it was ground, and 10 mg of the powdered
sample was dissolved in 25 mL of 0.05 M phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) pH 5 solution.65 The milk powder
was weighed and dissolved in boiling water; by the addition of acetic
acid, the proteins present in the milk powder were precipitated and
digested on the water bath for 15 min and was filtered through Whatman
filter paper No. 1 (55 mm diameter).76,78

Conclusions
In summary, this study provides a convenient and inexpensive method
to synthesize CuO Nps using C. bonducella as a novel reducing and stabilizing agent. The CuO Nps were characterized
by SEM, UV–vis, FT-IR, TGA–DTA, XRD, and XPS spectroscopy.
The CuO-Np-modified PIG electrode was used as a suitable sensor for
the determination of nanomolar concentration of VB2. The
stability of the CuO-Np-modified PIG electrode seemed to be satisfactory
for over a period of 120 days. The practical applicability of the
modified electrode was checked with real samples, such as egg yolk,
milk powder, and B-complex tablets. The results obtained showed very
good recovery, and the method could be extended for further practical
applications.
