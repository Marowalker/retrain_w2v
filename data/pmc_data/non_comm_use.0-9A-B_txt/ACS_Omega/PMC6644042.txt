Complexes of type [M(tpt)2]X2 (M2+ = Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+; tpt = 2,4,6-tri{pyrazol-1-yl}-1,3,5-triazine;
X– = BF4– or ClO4–) crystallize in a cubic lattice, with
the metal ion and ligand conformation showing unusual symmetry-imposed
disorder. Addition of 1 equiv AgX to the corresponding preformed [M(tpt)2]X2 salt in concentrated MeNO2 solution
affords thixotropic gels. Gelation was not observed in analogous reactions
using [Mn(tpt)2][ClO4]2, or from
reactions in other, more donating solvents. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images from dilute solutions of the reagents confirmed the fibrous
microstructure of the gels and their homogeneous elemental composition.
However, energy-dispersive X-ray data show a reduced Fe/Ag ratio compared
to the Co/Ag and Ni/Ag gels, where a 1:1 ratio of metals is evident.
More concentrated gels decomposed to silver nanoparticles during SEM
sample preparation. Mass spectrometry and 1H NMR indicate
that silver induces partial ligand displacement reactions in [Fe(tpt)2]2+ and [Co(tpt)2]2+, but
not in [Ni(tpt)2]2+. Hence, the strength of
the gels, which follows the order M = Mn (no gel) < Fe < Co
< Ni, correlates with the stability of octahedral [M(tpt)2]2+ under gelation conditions. Iron(II) complexes of the
related ligands 2,4,6-tri{pyrazol-1-yl}pyridine (tpp) and 2,4,6-tri{pyrazol-1-yl}pyrimidine
(tpym) did not undergo gelation with silver salts under the above
conditions. The unique properties of tpt as a gelator in this work
may reflect the crystallographically observed ability of metal-coordinated
tpt to chelate to exogenous silver ions, through its pendant pyrazolyl
group and triazinyl N donors. In contrast, the pendant azolyl substituents
in silver complexes of the nongelators tpp and tpym only bind exogenous
silver in monodentate fashion.

Introduction
Unravelling soft matter
systems is a rich field of scientific investigation
among chemists, physicists, and engineers. Over the last two decades,
supramolecular gels have gained attention because of their potential
applications in biomaterials, catalysis, displays, sensors, surface
science, tissue engineering, and pollutant removal.1−3 Supramolecular
gels are usually formed by low-molecular-weight gelator molecules
assembled in a 3D network, which traps a bulk amount of solvent via
noncovalent interactions. The reversible and dynamic nature of the
supramolecular interactions provides a mechanism for sensing or physical
transformations in response to external stimuli.2,3 More
recently, coordination polymer gels (CPGs) or metallogels have also
been widely reported, where metal ions play a crucial role in the
assembly of the 3D network.4−8 Inclusion of transition metals in the gel assembly brings tunability
to the coordination strength, as well as new redox, optic, electronic,
and magnetic properties which are intrinsic to the metal ion. These
afford additional possibilities for applications in catalysis, luminescence,
and adhesives as well as new types of sensing functionality.7,8

Silver(I)-containing metallogels of pyridyl-containing gelators
are a particularly common class of CPG,9−20 which can often template the formation of silver nanoparticles under
mild heating or reduction.13−20 CPGs of first-row transition ions are also often supported by pyridyl
gelators,9,11,21−33 but can also be prepared from more diverse organic scaffolds based
on other heterocyclic N-donors, carboxylates, or other donor groups.5−8,34−44 A handful of f-element CPGs have also been prepared, with emissive
or self-healing properties.45−47 In some cases, the organic components
have been found to be selective gelators for particular metal ions
or salts,31,35 whereas rare examples of heterometallic
CPGs have also been reported.21,48

2,4,6-Tri(pyrazolyl)-1,3,5-triazine
(tpt, Chart 1) and
its derivatives are well-known ligands
for transition ions,49−57 and we have recently investigated two aspects of the chemistry of
tpt. The first is the spin state of [Fe(tpt)2]2+ (Chart 1, M = Fe),
which is related to a well-known family of iron(II) spin-crossover
(SCO) complexes.56 The second are silver(I)
complexes of tpt, which crystallize as 1D-coordination polymers of
silver ions bridged by ditopic tpt ligands.57 We therefore proposed [Fe(tpt)2]2+ centers
might be linked into larger assemblies by coordination to exogenous
silver ions. We now report a family of heterometallic CPGs derived
by mixing preformed [M(tpt)2]X2 (M = Fe or another
3d metal ion; X– = BF4– or ClO4–) with the corresponding silver(I)
salt. To aid the interpretation of these results, complexes of two
other, related ligands were also prepared and screened for silver-induced
gelation behavior. Homometallic CPGs supported by a different trisubstituted
1,3,5-triazine scaffold have been described in a previous study.58

Results and Discussion
The precursor complexes [M(tpt)2][BF4]2 (M = Fe,56 Co, Ni, Cu55) or [M(tpt)2][ClO4]2 (M = Mn, Fe,56 Ni) were prepared
by reacting tpt with 0.5 equiv of the appropriate metal salt in nitromethane.
The polycrystalline complexes were obtained after the usual work-up,
and recrystallized from nitromethane using diethyl ether vapor as
antisolvent. A full structure refinement of [Ni(tpt)2][BF4]2 was achieved, which is isostructural with the
major α-polymorph of [Fe(tpt)2][BF4]2 (Figure 1 and Table S2).56 The complex
adopts the cubic space-group Ia3̅d, with one-sixth of a six-coordinate complex molecule in its asymmetric
unit and one unique C3-symmetric ligand
environment. The metal ion is distributed equally around the three
N-donors of the unique triazinyl ring, with a concomitant twofold
disorder of the coordinated pyrazolyl group. This symmetry-induced
disorder yields a cubic lattice of tpt ligands, linked by a random
array of nickel ions such that each tpt ligand coordinates only one
metal atom (Figures S1 and S2). The triazinyl
rings in the complex are sandwiched between two symmetry-equivalent
BF4– ions, forming a typical anion···π
interaction with a C···F distance of 2.756(8) Å
(Figure S3).55,59

Crystals of the other Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu complex
salts diffracted
more weakly, but are isostructural with [Ni(tpt)2][BF4]2 by X-ray powder diffraction (Figure 2 and Table S3). Samples of [Cu(tpt)2][BF4]2 were often contaminated by other crystals, however, including [Cu2(tpt)3(μ-bptO)(PzH)][BF4]3, which was crystallographically characterized (Figure S4 and Table S4). The 2,4-dipyrazolyl-6-hydroxy-1,3,5-triazine (bptOH, Chart 1) and pyrazole (PzH)
ligands in this complex are derived from hydrolysis of tpt during
the crystallization process (Scheme S1),
and their presence in the compound was confirmed by mass spectrometry
(Figure S17). Although [Cu(tpt)2][BF4]2 has previously been isolated in analytical
purity,55 copper(II) is known to promote
hydrolysis of tpt under a variety of conditions owing to its high
Lewis acidity.53,54 Therefore, the following heterometallic
gelation studies focus on the manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel
tpt complexes.

Figure 2 Experimental and simulated powder diffraction patterns
of the compounds
in this work: crystallographic simulation from α-[Fe(tpt)2][BF4]2 (black); experimental data from
[Fe(tpt)2][BF4]2 (blue), [Co(tpt)2][BF4]2 (cyan), [Ni(tpt)2][BF4]2 (pink), [Fe(tpt)2][ClO4]2 (red), and [Ni(tpt)2][ClO4]2 (yellow). Unit cell parameters for these materials
are given in Table S3.

Mononuclear [M(tpt)2]X2 was reacted
with
1 equiv of the appropriate silver salt AgBF4 or AgClO4, in nitromethane. No reaction was observed when [Mn(tpt)2][ClO4]2 was treated with AgClO4. However, when M = Fe, Co, or Ni, thixotropic CPGs assembled
within the time of mixing (Figure 3). Whereas the iron and cobalt gels show irreversible
thixotropy, reverting to fluid solution upon mild shaking, the nickel-containing
gels are more robust and remain viscous after shaking. The metal-dependence
of gel stability qualitatively follows the order M = Mn2+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+,
which corresponds to the Irving–Williams series for the strength
of metal–ligand interactions.60 The
gels retain their viscosity when stored for a period of months at
room temperature, in closed vials (Figure S5).

Figure 3 Heterometallic CPGs studied in this work.

The gelation procedure was also attempted in the different
solvents
water, acetone, methanol, acetonitrile, and dimethylformamide. Although
the mononuclear complexes are soluble in those solvents, the CPGs
only assembled in nitromethane and at concentrations of at least 16
mg·cm–3 of [M(tpt)2]X2 and 12 mg·cm–3 AgX. The Ag/[M(tpt)2]2+ stoichiometry is also critical for gelation. When
more than 1 equiv silver salt is used, the viscosity of the gel is
reduced, and when 3 equiv silver(I) salt was added the gel did not
assemble at all (Figure S6). Lastly, the
gelation process is also affected by temperature, with gelation being
enhanced if the components are mixed at 273 K and inhibited in reactions
above 298 K. Once formed, however, the gels are thermostable up to
ca. 330 K.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the
Fe/Ag, Co/Ag,
and Ni/Ag CPGs were investigated. When dilute solutions of [M(tpt)2]X2 and AgX were evaporated to dryness under ambient
conditions, networks of gel-like fibers of submicron thickness were
observed (Figures 4 and S7). In contrast, if preassembled
gel was evaporated to dryness, the SEM showed an amorphous material
homogeneously distributed with silver nanoparticles (Figure S8). Hence, at higher concentrations the CPGs template
the formation of silver nanoparticles when the solvent is removed.
This is a common property of silver-containing CPGs.13−20

Figure 4 Two
SEM images of the [Ni(tpt)2][BF4]2/AgBF4 CPG, showing the fibrous gel microstructure.

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
mapping experiments proved the homogeneous
distribution of the elements in the intact gels (Figures 5, S10, and S11). The Ag/M (M = Co or Ni) ratios in the [Co(tpt)2][BF4]2/AgBF4 and [Ni(tpt)2][BF4]2/AgBF4 gels were both
quantified at 1:1.0 ± 0.1 from these data. The Ag/Fe ratio in
[Fe(tpt)2][BF4]2/AgBF4 was lower however, at 1:4.1 ± 0.1, implying a reduced silver
content in that CPG. That suggests the composition of the gels varies
depending on the identity of the metal “M”, despite
their apparently similar microstructures.

Figure 5 Fluorine, silver, and
nickel EDX element maps for the [Ni(tpt)2][BF4]2/AgBF4 CPG.

Electrospray mass spectra of dilute [Fe(tpt)2]X2/AgX, [Ni(tpt)2]X2/AgX (X– = BF4– and ClO4–), and [Co(tpt)2][BF4]2/AgBF4 nitromethane solutions contain a mixture of M/tpt, Ag/tpt,
and/or M/Ag/tpt-containing species (Figures S12–S16). The [Fe(tpt)2][BF4]2/AgBF4 and [Ni(tpt)2][ClO4]2/AgClO4 samples show particularly intense mixed-metal ions with general
compositions [MAg(tpt)2Y2]+, [MAg2(tpt)mY3]+, and [M2Ag(tpt)mY4]+ (m = 2 or 3; Y– =
anion), with an [Fe3Ag3(tpt)3Y8]+ species also being observed in one case. This
indicates association of the [M(tpt)2]2+ (M
= Fe or Ni) and silver reagents into higher-order assemblies under
these conditions, possibly with partial displacement of tpt from the
iron or nickel centers. Spectra of BF4–-containing gels also show ions containing the hydrolyzed tpt ligand
fragment [bptO]− (Chart 1), which are not present in the ClO4–-containing samples. That could reflect participation
of F–, produced by hydrolysis of BF4– inside the spectrometer, as a base or nucleophile
in the hydrolysis reaction.61

1H NMR data from similar mixtures in CD3NO2 contain one paramagnetic tpt ligand environment. For M =
Fe and Co, addition of silver ions cleanly lowers the NMR symmetry
of the tpt ligand from C2 to C1, which clearly indicates formation of a heterometallic
M/Ag/tpt species. Additional peaks in the diamagnetic region also
indicate the presence of metal-free tpt in these silver-containing
solutions. Interestingly, for M = Ni (which forms the strongest gels)
addition of silver has little effect on the paramagnetic or diamagnetic
parts of the NMR spectrum (Figure 6). Hence, silver ions displace tpt ligands from [Fe(tpt)2]2+ and [Co(tpt)2]2+ in CD3NO2 solution to form a new paramagnetic species,
which is probably a heterometallic complex, but [Ni(tpt)2]2+ retains its integrity in the presence of silver ions
under these conditions. That further supports the suggestion that
the chemical structures of the [M(tpt)2]X2/AgX
CPGs depend on which “M” metal ion is present.

pure [M(tpt)2][BF4]2 (black)
and a 1:1 mixture of [M(tpt)2][BF4]2 and AgBF4 (blue), for M = Fe (top), Co (center), and
Ni (bottom).

Our previous work demonstrated
that [Fe(tpt)2]2+ is high-spin at room temperature,
and remains so on cooling.56 With the aim
of producing a new form of gel
with SCO switching properties,62,63 iron complexes of tpt-analogue
ligands based on di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine and di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyrimidine
scaffolds were investigated (Chart 2). These ligand types are well-known to afford SCO
iron(II) complexes.64,65 Salts of [Fe(tpp)2]2+ (tpp = 2,4,6-tri{pyrazol-1-yl}pyridine) have been
reported to exhibit SCO below room temperature in the solid state64 and in solution,66 but [Fe(tpym)2][BF4]2 and [Fe(tpym)2][ClO4]2 (tpym = 2,4,6-tri{pyrazol-1-yl}-pyrimidine)67 were newly synthesized for this study. These
salts of [Fe(tpym)2]2+ do not form isostructural
crystals from nitromethane/diethyl ether, but both adopt the expected
six-coordinate geometry with two pendant pyrazolyl groups per complex
molecule (Figures S17, S18, and Table S4). The complexes were crystallographically
high-spin at 120 K, which was confirmed by magnetic measurements showing
them to be fully high-spin between 5 and 300 K (Figure S21). [Fe(tpym)2][BF4]2 is also high-spin in CD3CN solution, over the liquid
range of that solvent (Figure S22). Hence,
in contrast to a closely related compound,65 tpym does not support SCO when bound to iron(II), which may reflect
the inductive properties of its pendant pyrazolyl substituent on the
tridentate ligand core.66 Coordination
of tpym to silver(I) yields dimeric or pentanuclear Ag/tpym molecular
assemblies, containing μ,κ1:κ3- or μ3,κ1:κ2:κ2-tpym ligands.57

Chart 2 Ligands tpp and tpym
Neither [Fe(tpp)2]X2 nor [Fe(tpym)2]X2 (X– = BF4– and ClO4–) formed gels when treated
with 1 equiv AgX, under the conditions used to form the [M(tpt)2]2+-containing CPGs. Hence, silver-induced gelation
appears to be a unique property of [M(tpt)2]2+ in this work.

Discussion
Among the ligands in
this work, only the [M(tpt)2]2+ scaffold supports
gelation upon addition of silver. Moreover,
the strength of the [M(tpt)2]X2/AgX gels depends
markedly on the metal “M”, in the order Mn (no gel)
< Fe < Co < Ni, and on the solvent present. The mass spectra
imply ligand exchange reactions occur in the M/Ag/tpt mixtures, to
form mixed-metal multinuclear species with a lower M/tpt stoichiometry.
NMR data confirm that conclusion for M = Fe and Co, but not for M
= Ni whose NMR spectrum is unchanged upon addition of silver. Hence,
the robustness of the [Ni(tpt)2]X2/AgX gels
probably reflects the increased stability of the [Ni(tpt)2]2+ center, which is consistent with the Irving–Williams
series.60 In that case, gelation of [Ni(tpt)2]X2/AgX occurs at concentrations high enough to
promote weak coordination of silver ions to [Ni(tpt)2]2+, yielding [Agn{Ni(tpt)2}n]3n+ oligomers
with reasonably regular structures. Formation of the [Fe(tpt)2]X2/AgX and [Co(tpt)2]X2/AgX
gels involves more complicated chemistry and, although these gels
have similar morphologies and compositions to the Ni gels by SEM,
their chemical structures may be more complex.

The reluctance
of [Fe(tpp)2]X2 and [Fe(tpym)2]X2 to undergo silver-induced gelation might be
understood from the structures of the homoleptic silver complexes
of those ligands. Crystals of [Ag(tpt)]X (X– = BF4– or ClO4–)
have been obtained as 1D coordination polymers with helical or linear
connectivities, with κ2,κ3:μ-tpt
ligands (Figure S23).57 That is, the tpt ligands in these structures chelate to
both silver ions that are coordinated to them, through their pyrazolyl
and triazinyl N donors. Several other 1,3,5-triazine derivatives can
also bridge between silver ions in a similar fashion, at least in
the solid state.68−72 In contrast, [Ag(tpp)]X can only assemble into larger aggregates
by monodentate binding through its pendant pyrazolyl substituent (Figure S24).57 Moreover,
although chelation of a second silver ion by tpym through the pyrimidinyl
N1 atom and C6-pyrazolyl substituent is feasible in principle, this
has not yet been observed in practice.57 That may reflect a preferred transoid orientation of those N-donors,
which avoids an intramolecular steric clash between the pyrimidinyl
C4 and pyrazolyl C5 C–H groups (highlighted in red in Scheme 1). The transoid conformation
is indeed observed crystallographically in [Fe(tpym)2][ClO4]2·nMeNO2 (Figure S17; the pendant pyrazolyl conformation
in the BF4– salt of this complex is uncertain
because of symmetry-imposed crystallographic disorder).

and Transoid Conformations of the Pendant Pyrazolyl Substituent
in Metal-Bound tpym. The Transoid Conformation is Present in Crystalline
[Fe(tpym)2][ClO4]2·nMeNO2
Hence, of the ligands considered in this work, only tpt
has a proven
ability to chelate two silver ions simultaneously, which will afford
more stable mixed-metal assemblies in solutions of [M(tpt)2]X2 and AgX. That might explain the unique gelation properties
of the [M(tpt)2]X2/AgX system.

Conclusions
A new family of heterometallic, thixotropic CPGs is reported based
on the potentially ditopic tpt gelator ligand, with the formula {[M(tpt)2]X2}{AgX}n (M2+ = Fe2+, Co2+ or Ni2+; X– = BF4– or ClO4–; n ≤ 1). The stability of the gels qualitatively
correlates with the thermodynamic stability of the [M(bpt)2]2+ precursor complexes, according to the Irving–Williams
series. Thus, the strongest and most thermally stable gels were obtained
for M = Ni. SEM images showing the expected fibrous microstructures
were obtained from dilute solutions of the gel components, with element
mapping demonstrating their chemical homogeneity. However, EDX analyses
imply that the M/Ag ratio in the gels, n, is smaller
for M = Fe than for M = Co or Ni where approximately 1:1 ratios of
these metals were observed. 1H NMR also demonstrates that
solutions of [M(tpt)2]X2 and AgX contain different
species when M = Fe or Co, than for M = Ni (where the [Ni(tpt)2]2+ cation retains its integrity in the presence
of silver ions). Hence, the chemical structure of the gels seems to
vary depending on which “M” metal ion is present. The
related complexes [Fe(tpp)2]2+ and [Fe(tpym)2]2+ do not form CPGs when combined with silver
salts, which we attribute to their reduced ability to bind exogenous
silver ions in a chelating (as opposed to monodentate) fashion. The
current work aims to modify the gelator ligand structure further,
to produce new thermochromic CPGs from SCO-active iron complex precursors.73−76

Experimental
Ligands tpt77 and
tpym,67 and the complexes [Cu(tpt)2][BF4]2,55 [Fe(tpt)2]X2,56 and [Fe(tpp)2]X264 (X– = BF4– and ClO4–), were prepared following the literature
procedures.

Synthesis of the Homoleptic Mononuclear Complexes

(20 cm3), and of tpt (16 mg, 0.058 mmol) in nitromethane
(15 cm3), were mixed with stirring. The mixture was stirred
for 5 min, then filtered. Addition of diethyl ether precipitated the
product as a pale lilac powder, which was recrystallized from nitromethane/diethyl
ether if required. Yields ranged from 50 to 85%. Characterization
data for the complexes are as follows.

CAUTION! Although we have experienced
no problems
in handling the perchlorate salts in this study, metal–organic
perchlorates are potentially explosive and should be handled with
due care in small quantities.

Synthesis of the Gels
A silver tetrafluoroborate (3.1
mg, 0.016 mmol) solution in nitromethane (0.25 cm3, corresponding
to 12.4 mg·cm–3) was added to a solution of
[Fe(tpt)2][BF4]2 in nitromethane
(12.5 mg, 0.016 mmol in 0.7 cm3; 17.9 mg·cm–3). After brief stirring at room temperature, the CPG was formed.
All the other CPG combinations were prepared in an analogous manner,
using equimolar quantities of the appropriate complex and silver salt
precursors.

Crystallography
All the crystals
characterized in this
study were obtained by slow diffusion of diethyl ether vapor into
nitromethane solutions of the compounds. Crystallographic data were
measured with an Agilent Supernova dual-source diffractometer, using
monochromated Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. The
diffractometer was fitted with an Oxford Cryostream low-temperature
device. Experimental data (Table S1) and
refinement procedures for the structure determinations are given in
the Supporting Information. The structures
were solved by direct methods (SHELXS9778) and developed by full least-squares refinement on F2 (SHELXL9778). Crystallographic
figures were prepared using XSEED,79 and
coordination volumes (VOh, Tables S2 and S4) were calculated using Olex2.80

Other Measurements
Electrospray
mass spectra were obtained
on a Bruker MicroTOF spectrometer, from nitromethane solution. Sodium
cations and formate anions in the molecular ion assignments originate
from calibrants in the spectrometer feed solutions. Elemental microanalyses were performed by the University of Leeds
School of Chemistry microanalytical service or the London Metropolitan
University microanalytical service. X-ray powder diffraction patterns
were measured using a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer, with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). SEM images were obtained using
an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 environmental microscope, operating at 3 kV.
A silicon wafer supporting the gel was mounted on an SEM stub using
an adhesive copper film, then coated with iridium before imaging.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were obtained using a Quantum
Design SQUID magnetometer in an applied field of 5000 G. Diamagnetic
corrections were estimated from Pascal’s constants,81 and a diamagnetic correction for the sample
holder was also applied. Susceptibility measurements in solution were
obtained by the Evans method using a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer operating
at 500.13 MHz.82,83 A diamagnetic correction for
the sample81 and a correction for the variation
of the density of the CD3CN solvent with temperature84 were applied to these data.
