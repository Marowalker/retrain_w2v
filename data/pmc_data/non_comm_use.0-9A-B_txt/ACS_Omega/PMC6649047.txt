Compared
with their multicomponent analogues, single-component
white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) can eliminate the disadvantages
such as high cost, fluorescence self-absorption, poor machinability,
and reproducibility, but how to produce white light with high quality
in a single-phase host is still a big challenge. In the work, a series
of Eu3+/Tb3+-doped Gd(pic)3 and La(pic)3 are obtained through solvothermal conditions with picolinic
acid (Hpic) and lanthanide nitrate. Researchers could regularly modulate
the emitting color of phosphors by adjusting the excitation wavelength
as well as the relative concentration of Ln3+ ions to obtain
white light. Different luminance values [especially quantum yield
(QYs)] between host materials Gd(pic)3 and La(pic)3 are investigated, which shows that doping of Eu3+ into Gd(pic)3 can improve QY to a great extent. By employing
Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 and Gd0.9141Eu0.0451Tb0.0408(pic)3 as phosphors, we successfully fabricated two excellent near-ultraviolet
(365 nm) WLEDs with CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.3052, 0.3462)
and (0.3007, 0.3448), relatively low color-correlated temperature
(6755, 7001 K), and high color rendering index (Ra = 71.8, 72.9). This approach may open a new prospect
for developing single-phase near-ultraviolet phosphors with high efficiency.

1 Introduction
White-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) have drawn wide attention in
recent years because of their high luminous efficiency, long lifetime
(∼100 000 h), quick response, low power consumption,
and most of all, environment-friendly compared to traditional incandescent
light bulbs and fluorescent lamps.1−6 There are three universal methods to create WLEDs: (i) to blend
red, green, and blue LED (RGB WLEDs);7 (ii)
to excite a yellow phosphor (e.g., the commercially used YAG:Ce3+) or multiphosphors by a blue lighting (450–470 nm)
(blue WLEDs); (iii) to excite RGB phosphors or a white phosphor by
an ultraviolet or near-ultraviolet (350–420 nm) light source
(n-UV WLEDs),8 the latter two are also
referred to as phosphor-converted white LED (pc-WLED). For RGB WLEDs,
how to balance the luminous intensity of red, green, and blue LED
as well as the even color remains a big challenge. As for blue WLEDs,
few phosphors possess an absorption band range from 440 to 460 nm
except YAG:Ce3+, making blue WLEDs difficult to promote,
even worse are their poor color rendering index (CRI < 80) and
high-correlated color temperature (CCT > 7000 K) for the lack of
red-light.9,10 Hence, there have been more and more research
studies about n-UV
WLEDs because of their high CRI, chromatic stability, and tunable
CCT. Furthermore, many organic ligand-containing phosphors have a
strong broad absorption band in UV or n-UV regions.11,12 The application of multicomponent n-UV WLEDs is restricted for high
cost, fluorescence self-absorption, poor machinability, and reproducibility,
as well as the different degradation rate of tricolor phosphors.13 Single-component n-UV WLEDs can eliminate the
disadvantages of multicomponent ones, and they possess better machinability
and color reproducibility,14,15 but how to produce
single-phase white light with high quality is still a big challenge.

Up to now, researchers have been doing a lot to develop novel phosphors
for single-component n-UV WLEDs,16 such
as inorganic materials,17−19 organic molecules,20−22 polymers,23−25 and hybrid inorganic–organic composites, and
so forth.26−29 In the past decades, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have
recieved tremendous concern because of diverse structures and application
prospects in magnetism, separation, gas storage, catalysis, and drug
delivery, and so forth.34,35 While few works have
been reported about MOFs as UV WLED phospors,30−33 there are several advantages.
First, the organization of various metal nodes within organic linkers
can produce a series of processable phosphors resulting from energy
transfer from organic ligands to the metal centers or the reverse
(MLCT) with a wide emissive range from 300 to 1550 nm. Second, the
experimental condition is more facile (hydrothermal or solvothermal,
at low temperature) and the operation is easier (one-pot) compared
with current hybrid inorganic phosphors, which are synthesized under
high or reducing pressures at high temperature (above 1000 °C).

Several white-light-emitting MOFs have been produced by codoping
several different Ln3+ ions into their isologues with appropriate
concentration in recent years.36−38 Lanthanide ions, particularly
trivalent terbium and europium ions, have long been used for their
narrow band, large Stokes shift, long lifetime, and high color purity
based on 4f electronic transitions which have remarkable influences
on light generation and amplification.39,50,51 Doping Eu3+(red) and Tb3+ (green)
emitters into blue-emitted host materials (organic ligand in most
cases) and then regulating their relative ratio and excitation wavelength
have provided an effective and simple strategy of generating white-light-emitting
materials for WLEDs.52−55 Several research studies have been done about Eu3+ and
Tb3+ codoped La3+ complexes as white-light-emitting
materials, and LEDs have been made by coating phosphors on commercially
available UV LEDs, but most of them have not investigated the performance
parameters such as CIE coordinate, CCT, CRI, and so forth. Recently,
our group successively fabricated a single-phase n-UV WLED with low
CCT (5733 K) and high CRI (Ra = 73.4)
using Eu0.045Tb0.955CPOMBA, more research needs
to be done to develop commercial applications in the field.33

The tunable colors from doped lanthanide
MOFs (Ln-MOFs) have laid
the foundation to compensate blue light from pic–, green from Tb3+, and red from Eu3+ in La(pic)3:Eu3+,Tb3+, and Gd(pic)3:Eu3+,Tb3+ to achieve white light. To our knowledge,
white-light-emitting La3+–Eu3+–Tb3+ ternary metal-codoped lanthanide complexes have been investigated
for a few years, while Gd3+–Eu3+–Tb3+ codoped lanthanide complexes instead of La3+ have
never been mentioned, not to mention Gd3+–Eu3+ bimetallic complexes. Most of the research studies are confined
to using La-MOFs as host materials, while very few studies paid close
attention to Gd-MOFs. In order to make sure whether or not La3+ or Gd3+ is different as host materials, we have
synthesized a series of doped Ln-MOFs featuring inherent broad-band
direct white emission, and we have mainly focused on how to modulate
the emission light by altering lanthanide ionic types, concentration,
and excitation wavelength. On the basis of the above considerations,
a novel Gd(pic)3:Eu3+ bichromatic (blue from
ligand and red from Eu3+) white-light phospor has been
successfully synthesized. Both of the two host complexes, La(pic)3 and Gd(pic)3, have already been first synthesized
by us in 2014,40 the host complexes emit
blue light (413/422 nm) attributed to pic– ligands,
and on this basis further reactions have been done to make new doped
lanthanide complexes by carefully adjusting the initial ratios of
La(NO3)3/Gd(NO3)3: Eu(NO3)3:Tb(NO3)3. Doping of Eu3+/Tb3+ with additional red (Eu3+, 617
nm) light and green (Tb3+, 543 nm) led to the formation
of white-light-emitting isostructural La(pic)3: Eu3+, Tb3+ and Gd(pic)3: Eu3+, Tb3+. With judicious adjustment of the excitation wavelength,
the color of luminescence can be tailored from red, through white
to blue. Furthermore, lifetimes and quantum yields (QYs) of these
complexes were investigated. The CIE coordinates, CRI and CCT values
were calculated, respectively. An excellent WLED assembly has also
been built on an ultraviolet LED chip (365 nm) with the Gd(pic)3: Eu3+ or Gd(pic)3: Eu3+,
Tb3+ sample. It is worth mentioning that they can exhibit
good thermal stability, which was indispensable for LEDs materials.
It is for the first time that Gd1–xEuxMOFs are made into LEDs and checked
for their practicability.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Composition, Structure, and Morphology
The single-crystal
structure was described in detail according to
single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses in the reported reference.33−35 The Ln(III) site in Ln(pic)3 (Ln = La, Gd, Eu, Tb) is
coordinated by six bis-monodentate oxygen atoms and three pyridine
nitrogen atoms from 3 pic– ligands, giving a one
dimensional chain constructed from Ln3+ nodes and pic– linkers (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 2, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 shows rod-like crystals.
Crystallinity and purity can be revealed in powder X-ray diffraction
analysis of these complexes, similar diffraction peaks with La(pic)3 indicate that all the complexes are isostructural obviously,
but some of the La3+ or Gd3+ nodes have been
replaced by Eu3+or Tb3+ according to inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 exhibit good thermal stability as no obvious weight
loss was observed until 420 °C in the TG curve and X-ray power
diffraction (PXRD) patterns at different temperatures (Figure S1).

2.2 Photoluminescent Properties
2.2.1 Antenna Effects
Photoluminescent
properties of La(pic)3 and Gd(pic)3 have already
been well studied in earlier research.40 Both La(pic)3 and Gd(pic)3 exhibit wide emission
bands from 380 to 500 nm, leading to strong blue luminescence. The
luminescence of La(pic)3 and Gd(pic)3 presumably
is due to π → π* transition of the pic– ligand. On the basis of the DFT calculation (Figure S2), the triplet excited-state energy of Hpic is 33891
cm–1, and the corresponding energy gap ΔE (1ππ* → 3ππ*)
is 7009 cm–1. Higher intersystem-crossing efficiency
will be achieved if ΔE is greater than 5000
cm–1 according to Reinhoudt’s empirical rule
(Figure S3).41 Therefore, we can infer that the process efficiency in Hpic is high,
and the emission of Tb3+ and Eu3+ can be sensitized
synchronously. In addition, in the Förster model, a necessary
prerequisite for energy transfer between ligands and Ln3+ is the overlap between the donor excitation and the acceptor absorption.46,47 The excitation spectrum of Eu(pic)3 and Tb(pic)3 and the absorption spectra of Hpic are shown in Figure S3. The overlap between the two bands can be observed
clearly, indicating that the central Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions can be efficiently sensitized by Hpic, which is the antenna
effect.42−45

Emission spectra of Eu(pic)3 and Tb(pic)3 are shown in Figure S4, upon excitation
at 300 nm, Eu(pic)3 exhibits five major peaks assigned
to transitions between the first excited state (5D0) and the ground multiplet (7FJ, J = 0–4) transitions, which are 5D0 → 7F0 (579 nm), 5D0 → 7F1 (591 nm), 5D0 → 7F2 (617 nm), 5D0 → 7F3 (649 nm),
and 5D0 → 7F4 (688
nm). Tb(pic)3 possesses the characteristic transitions
of Tb3+5D4 to 7FJ (J = 6–3) at 490,
543, 582, and 621 nm for Tb3+. Lifetimes of the excited
states 5D0 (Eu3+) and 5D4 (Tb3+) were monitored at 617 and 543 nm,
respectively (Figure S5). The values are
1931.24 μs for Eu(pic)3 and 1848.62 μs for
Tb(pic)3. Excited at 300 nm, the QY of Eu(pic)3 is φ = 56.00%, while that of Tb(pic)3 is φ
= 98.64%. The long lifetime and high quantum yield can be well explained
by the excellent antenna effect between Ln3+ and Hpic.

2.2.2 Luminescence
The emission spectra
measured at room temperature for the powder samples of Gd(pic)3:Eu3+ and Gd(pic)3:Tb3+ are
displayed in Figures 3–6 and S6, respectively. Excited
at 300 nm, Eu3+-doped Gd(pic)3:Eu3+ displays the characteristic transitions of Eu3+ at 579,
591, 617, 649, and 688 nm. The luminescence intensity of the ligand
is gradually weakened, whereas that of the Eu3+ ions is
enhanced with increasing Eu3+ concentration. Accordingly,
the CIE chromaticity coordinates changed from (0.1940, 0.2328) (blue)
to (0.6287, 0.3509) (red). Similarly, the Tb3+-doped Gd(pic)3: Tb3+ exhibits characteristic transitions of Tb3+ at 490, 543, 582, 620, 688, and 698 nm. As the Tb3+ concentration increases, the CIE chromaticity coordinate moves from
(0.1940, 0.2328) (blue) to (0.3266, 0.5707) (green).

Figure 6 Lifetime (A) and QY (B) of Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 with excitation wavelengths varying from 280 to
365 nm.

Surprisingly, when the excitation
wavelength of Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 is controlled from 300 to 380
nm, the color footprints travel across the red, yellow, and white,
white-light emission attracted the most attention without doubt. As
is shown in Figure 5, upon excitation at around 300 nm, Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 simultaneously shows the characteristic transitions
of Eu3+ at 579, 591, 617, 649, and 688 nm, and emits red
light on the whole. When adjusting the excitation light from 300 to
380 nm, the intensity of the characteristic transitions of Eu3+ decreases; at the same time, the 418 and 530 nm peaks of
the pic– group are enhanced, and as a result, color
variations are finally generated. Excited at 365 nm, Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 emits white light at (0.33022,
0.35084), which is very close to the coordinate for pure white-light
(0.3333, 0.3333). It is proved that the relative intensities of yellow,
white, and blue emission can be well-tuned by controlling the excitation
wavelength. Lifetime and QY of Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 decrease as the excitation wavelength changes from
300 nm (2094.8911 μs, 83.93%) to 365 nm (1928.7613 μs,
5.66%) (Figure 6).
The corresponding photographs of the tunable colors generated from
this doped compound excited under UV laser with different wavelengths
are shown in Figure 5. Although the QY at high temperature has not been tested for the
restrictions in experimental conditions, that is, tightness of the
integrating sphere used here cannot satisfy the vacuum needed in the
temperature-controlling progress, emission spectra and CIE chromaticity
diagram of Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 at 300, 400, and 500 K are shown in Figure S13, relative intensity of the peak located at about 525 nm enhance
with increasing temperature, and the CIE coordinate slightly moves
to yellow, but do not reveal major departures from that at room temperature,
indicating good temperature stability. Excitation wavelength dependence
of emission property of corresponding Eu3+-doped La(pic)3 is also discovered in agreement with references, but it does
not cross the white-light emission regions. Emission peaks of pic– Gd1–xEux(pic)3 and La1–xEux(pic)3 are different,
and there are two peaks in Gd1–xEux(pic)3 at 418 nm in blue
and 530 nm in green region, but only one peak (420 nm) exists in La1–xEux(pic)3 (Figure S7). Photoluminescence
of Gd0.9141Eu0.0451Tb0.0408(pic)3 has also been studied minutely (Figures 7, 8, and S12), which emits white light after excitation
at 365 nm with lifetimes of 1803.01625 μs (544 nm) and 2033.35093
μs (617 nm), and a QY of 6.51%. As excitation wavelength λex changes from 200 to 300 nm, the CIE points travel from blue
to white to yellow. When λex continues to increase
to 365 nm, the point goes back to blue across the white region. This
reversible process is fascinating, which can be well explained from Figure S3. In Figure S12, when changing the excitation light from 280 to 365 nm, the lifetime
of Tb3+ (544 nm) decreases, while that of Eu3+ (617 nm) decreases first and then increases, which shows the same
trend as quantum yield. The whole process is controlled by the energy
transfer efficiency from Tb3+ ions to Eu3+ ions.
As shown in Figure S11, when the excitation
wavelength changes from 280 to 330 nm, the energy transfer efficiency
decreases, and then increases from 330 to 365 nm. Theoretically, the
efficiency of energy transfer (ηET) can be estimated
from eq 1(48,49) 1  where τ0 and τ1 are luminescence lifetimes of the Tb3+5D4 emission (544 nm) in Tb(pic)3 and Eu0.1058Tb0.8942(pic)3.

and 365 nm (right).

In order to further compare
the influence of host Ln3+ ions (Gd3+ or La3+) on the luminescence property,
we have investigated a series of La(pic)3 and Gd(pic)3 complexes doped with different ratios of Eu3+/Tb3+. Their lifetimes (544 nm for Tb3+, 617 nm for
Eu3+) and QYs excited at 300 nm are shown in Table S1 and S2. As we can see, both La3+ and Gd3+ can improve the luminescent lifetime, but their
results are absolutely opposite as to QY. The QYs of Gd1–xEux(pic)3 increase
substantially (φ = 85%) compared to pure Eu(pic)3 (φ = 56.00%), whereas QYs of La1–xEux(pic)3 decrease significantly.
Although QYs drop when doped Tb3+ ions into Gd(pic)3 and La(pic)3, the experimental QY values in Gd1–xTbx(pic)3 are higher than those in La1–xTbx(pic)3, a little
different. It is speculated that the Gd3+ complex serves
as a better host than La3+ in this system. The reason why
Gd3+ is superior to La3+ is still unclear and
needs to be further studied.

2.3 LED Properties
As we can see in Figure 9, LED coating of
Gd0.9512Eu0.0488(pic)3 can emit natural
white light to our naked eyes, and the CIE color coordinates of the
fabricated WLED is (0.3052, 0.3462) with a few minor deviations from
the simulated one of emission spectrum at 350.0 mA, which is very
close to the standard point (0.3333, 0.3333). The fabricated WLED
shows an excellent CRI of ∼71.8 Ra owing to the increased intensity of red emission from Eu3+, and the value is closer to that of the traditional YAG: Ce white
LEDs (∼75 Ra). The luminous efficiency
of the WLED is 1.1 lm/W and the CCT at the same current is 6755 K,
which could be assigned to cold light. We believed that CCT value
can be lowered by increasing the Eu3+ ratio to make the
LED a warm light source. For Gd0.9141Eu0.0451Tb0.0408(pic)3, the CIE (0.3007, 0.3448), and
a CRI value of 72.9 Ra, the luminous efficiency
of 1.2 lm/W and the CCT of 7001 K are observed. It can be demonstrated
that codoped Ln-MOFs phosphor can be used for WLEDs with good color
rendering.

3 Conclusions
Choosing
Gd3+ as host ions and diverse organic linkers
in doped Ln-MOFs might be applied to generate tunable white-light-emitting
materials with long lifetime and high QY. WLED performance tests make
this approach closer to practical applications. It is hoped that there
would be further studies about solid-state white-light-emitting MOF
materials and explore their applications in other areas in the near
future. Our further study will focus on the universality of the difference
between host Gd3+ and La3+ ions, and the energy
transition mechanism of this process.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 General Information
All chemicals
and solvents were commercially available and used without further
purification. Thermal gravimetric analysis was performed on a SETARAM
LAB-SYS equipment at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2 atmosphere. The morphology and composition were studied by
a JSM-7500F SEM–energy-dispersive system instrument (resolution
ratio, 1.0 nm, 15.0 KV) and the structural features of compounds were
studied by PXRD using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer. ICP
spectroscopy was recorded on a PerkinElmer Optima 8000 DV ICP.

4.2 Photophysical Characterization
UV–vis
absorption was tested on a domestic U-3310 spectrophotometer. Steady-state
emission spectra and QYs were measured on an Edinburgh FLS-920 spectrophotometer
and its integrating sphere in solid state at room temperature.

4.3 LED Fabrication and Measurement
White
LEDs were assembled with 365 nm GaN chip and MOF phosphor. First,
the chip was fixed at the center of the LED substrate, then the 365
nm UV chip was coated on the mixture of phosphor and silicone in different
proportions, and baked at 160 °C for 30 min. The performance
parameters of the ready-made LEDs were measured by an HP-8000 integrating
sphere spectroradiometer system.

4.4 Synthesis
of La(pic)3:Eu3+,Tb3+ and Gd(pic)3:Eu3+,Tb3+

of picolinic acid (0.037 g 0.3 mmol), La(NO3)3·6H2O (0.038 g, 0.0894 mmol),
Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (0.003 g, 0.0067
mmol), Tb(NO3)3·6H2O (0.003
g, 0.0066 mmol), NaOH (0.012 g, 03 mmol), and 10 mL H2O
was sealed in a 20 mL stainless steel reactor with a Teflon liner.
Then the resulting solution was kept at 160 °C for 3 days, colorless
rod-like crystals were collected after cooling to room temperature,
filtrating, and washing with H2O.
