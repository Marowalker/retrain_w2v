Retinoic
acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic sensor protein
that recognizes viral RNAs and triggers an innate immune response
in cells. Panhandle-like base-paired blunt-ended 5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA
is a characteristic feature of viral RNAs. Structural studies of RIG-I
C-terminal domain bound 5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA complexes show the
direct interaction between all the 5′ terminal phosphates (α,
β, and γ) and protein, suggesting γ phosphate might
be a major recognition determinant for RIG-I binding. Biochemical
studies, however, suggest that 5′ pp-dsRNA is the minimal determinant
for RIG-I binding and antiviral response. Despite biochemical and
structural studies, the origin of viral RNA recognition by RIG-I is
an unsolved problem. X-ray structures of RIG-I bound dsRNA not only
provide atomic insight into the interaction network but also provide
sufficiently good models for computational studies. We report structure-based
molecular dynamics (MD) free energy calculations to quantitatively
estimate the energetics of RIG-I binding to dsRNA containing 5′
ppp, 5′ pp, and 5′ p. The results suggest that RIG-I
weakly discriminates between 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA
(favoring former) and strongly disfavors 5′ p-dsRNA with respect
to the rest. Interestingly, direct interaction between γ phosphate
of 5′ ppp-dsRNA and RIG-I is a robust feature of the MD simulations.
dsRNA binding to RIG-I is associated with Mg2+ dissociation
from the 5′ phosphate/s of dsRNA. The higher Mg2+ dissociation penalty from 5′ ppp-dsRNA with respect to 5′
pp-dsRNA offsets most of the favorable interaction between RIG-I and
γ phosphate of 5′ ppp-dsRNA. This leads to weak discrimination
between 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA. 5′ p-dsRNA
is discriminated strongly because of the loss of interaction with
RIG-I.

Introduction
Retinoic acid-inducible
gene-I (RIG-I) is a major pathogen recognition
receptor that recognizes a broad range of viruses (e.g., influenza,
rabies, dengue, hepatitis C, etc.) and triggers an antiviral response
in the cytoplasm.1−6 Panhandle-like blunt-ended dsRNA with 5′ triphosphate is
a signature of viral RNA, which is preferentially recognized by RIG-I.7−9 RIG-I is composed of a C-terminal domain (CTD), helicase domains
(HEL1, HEL2, and HEL2i), Pincer domain (P), and N-terminal caspase
activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) (see Figure 1a, CARD not shown). The CTD of RIG-I is a
beta sheet bundle stabilized by Zn2+ ion (Figure 1a), which recognizes the viral
RNA by interacting with the 5′ tri-/diphosphates of dsRNA.10−12 Helicase core domains (HEL1 and HEL2) form an ATP binding cleft
and along with HEL2i domain bind to the backbone of dsRNA13−16 (Figure 1a). The
Pincer domain (P) acts as a transducer of information by connecting
CTD and ATPase core formed by HEL1 and HEL2 domain (Figure 1a).16 N-terminal CARD domains are responsible for downstream signaling
in response to viral RNA binding.6,14 The mechanism
of downstream signaling is not well-understood; however, it has been
proposed15,16 that viral RNA binding by CTD and helicase
domains creates an ATP binding cleft.17 In response to ATP binding and/or hydrolysis, the RIG-I helicase
domain undergoes compaction that might potentially eject the CARDs
for interaction with other proteins and subsequent signaling.17

Figure 1 (a) Structural overview of blunt-ended 5′ ppp-dsRNA
bound
RIG-I (containing helicase and CTDs) complex (PDB: 4AY2).19 Individual domains of RIG are color-coded: CTD: cyan, HEL1:
dark green, HEL2: light green, HEL2i: light blue, Pincer (P): orange.
Loop spanning position 847–853 of CTD is shown as thick tube
and highlighted with an arrow. Zn2+ of the zinc-binding
domain of CTD is represented as a cyan sphere and ADP-Mg2+ bound to the HEL-1 domain is in the magenta sticks. Blunt-ended
dsRNA is shown in yellow and the guanine base at the 5′ end
with triphosphate is shown as sticks. Same color coding is used throughout
this paper. The spherical region selected for MD simulation is indicated
in the black broken circle. (b) Thermodynamic cycle (TC) for dsRNA:RIG-I
binding. Vertical legs correspond to binding; horizontal legs correspond
to the alchemical transformation of 5′ ppp-dsRNA into 5′
pp-dsRNA, either in the solvated RIG-I complex (above) or in the free
state in water (below). The 5′ ppp-dsRNA/5′ pp-dsRNA
binding free energy difference is ΔΔG = ΔGcomp – ΔGfree = ΔGbind(5′ pp-dsRNA)
– ΔGbind(5′ ppp-dsRNA).
Horizontal legs of the thermodynamic cycle (ΔGcomp, ΔGfree) were computed
by MD free energy simulations. Mg2+ bound dsRNA is considered
as the prevalent species in the lower horizontal leg; Mg2+ is shown as a green sphere. X-ray structure of the RIG-I:5′ppp-dsRNA
complex: (c) representative structure (PDB: 3LRR)11 revealed that RIG-I CTD of dsRNA interacts with α,
β, and γ phosphates of 5′ adenine terminal of dsRNA
through extensive electrostatic interactions. (d) PDB: 4AY2(19) suggests no direct interaction between γ phosphate
of 5′ ppp-dsRNA and RIG-I. The network of electrostatic interactions
are represented as dashed lines. Key residues of RIG-I CTD involved
in RNA binding are shown as stick models.

Structural studies11 suggest that
the
structure of CTD of RIG-I is very similar in complex and in isolation,
except for the loop region (residue 847–853, Figure 1a). The free CTD structures
in solution10,18 have revealed that the loop is
very flexible. Comparison with the dsRNA bound structures11 suggests that dsRNA binding might stabilize
the specific conformation of the loop. X-ray structures (PDB 3LRR and 3LRN)11 of RIG-I CTD bound 5′ ppp-dsRNA have revealed extensive
interactions between α, β, γ-phosphates of dsRNA
and RIG-I, whereas a full RIG-I(ΔCARDs) bound 5′ ppp-dsRNA
structure (PDB 4AY2) suggests19 no direct interaction between
γ-phosphate and RIG-I. The conflicting γ-phosphate–RIG-I
interaction is also limited by the resolution of the X-ray structures.
It can be concluded that out of three X-ray structures (PDB 3LRR, 3LRN, and 4AY2), first two structures
suggest a direct interaction between γ phosphate and RIG-I.
Thus, γ phosphate appears to be a major recognition factor for
RIG-I binding, and RIG-I should discriminate strongly between 5′
ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA, preferring the former. It is worth
mentioning that none of the resolved structures of the complexes contain
Mg2+ bound to the terminal 5′ tri-/diphosphates
of dsRNA.

Recent biochemical studies20 have revealed
that blunt-ended dsRNA with 5′ diphosphate (5′ pp) is
the minimum requirement for RIG-I binding and antiviral response.
As both 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA can induce antiviral
response, γ phosphate is certainly not a recognition determinant.
Biochemical studies further reveal that isolated RIG-I domains bind
more strongly to viral RNA with respect to the full RIG-I.21 It has been suggested21 that covalently linked RIG-I domains reduce the overall binding
affinity but increase the specificity for efficient discrimination
of viral RNAs from host RNAs.

Despite the advancement of structural
and biochemical studies,
the atomic insight into the dynamics of these complexes is unknown
and the following key questions on dsRNA binding to RIG-I remain unanswered:
(a) how strongly RIG-I discriminates between 5′ ppp-dsRNA,
5′ pp-dsRNA, and 5′ p-dsRNA (i.e., relative binding
affinity)? (b) What is the relationship between relative binding affinity
and the 3D structures? (c) Why γ phosphate is not a major recognition
factor for RIG-I binding?

Medium resolution X-ray structures10,19 now provide
sufficiently good models for structure-based computer simulations
for addressing the above questions. We report structure-based molecular
dynamics (MD) free energy simulations for deciphering the energetics
of dsRNA binding to RIG-I, thereby linking 3D structures and energetics.
Starting with X-ray19 structure (PDB: 4AY2, full RIG-I(ΔCARDs):5′
ppp-dsRNA, resolution 2.8 Å) as our initial models, we have performed
MD simulations of RIG-I:5′ ppp-dsRNA, RIG-I:5′ pp-dsRNA,
and RIG-I:5′ p-dsRNA complexes. Calculations involve the change
in binding affinity upon “mutation” of the 5′
terminal of dsRNA using an appropriate thermodynamic cycle (TC) shown
in Figure 1b. The calculations
quantitatively estimated the binding affinity difference between 5′
ppp-dsRNA, 5′ pp-dsRNA, and 5′ p-dsRNA to RIG-I binding.
Our estimated binding free energy difference between 5′ ppp-dsRNA/5′
pp-dsRNA is small (∼2 kcal/mol in favor of 5′ ppp-dsRNA)
and 5′ ppp-dsRNA/5′ p-dsRNA is large (∼9 kcal/mol
favoring 5′ ppp-dsRNA). The signs are consistent with the experimental
observations and the magnitudes seem biochemically sensible. dsRNA
binding to RIG-I is associated with Mg2+ dissociation from
5′ terminal of dsRNA, desolvation, and protein–RNA interactions.
Our simulations suggest that γ phosphate establish direct electrostatic
contact with RIG-I. However, higher Mg2+ dissociation penalty
from 5′ ppp-dsRNA with respect to 5′ pp-dsRNA offsets
most of the γ phosphate-RIG-I interaction, leading to the loss
of binding affinity for RIG-I. This seems to be responsible for weak
discrimination between 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA,
with RIG-I weakly preferring the former. The binding of 5′
p-dsRNA is strongly disfavored because of the substantial loss of
interaction between 5′ terminal of dsRNA and RIG-I.

Materials
and Methods
MD Setup
The MD setup is given in Figure S1. Structure of human RIG-I bound to 5′ ppp-dsRNA
was taken from the Protein Data Bank (entry 4AY2;19 crystallographic resolution 2.8 Å). We have selected 4AY2 as a template for
MD for two reasons: (1) the panhandle-like bound RNA with 5′
triphosphate is an excellent mimic of viral RNAs and (2) the RIG-I
in this complex contains CTD as well as the helicase domains. A spherical
region of radius 30 Å, centered at the terminal phosphate of
dsRNA, was cut from the selected structure and considered for MD simulations.
We retained residues that had at least one nonhydrogen atom within
the 30 Å sphere. Nonhydrogen atoms of RIG-I and dsRNA in the
outer region between 27 and 30 Å from the sphere’s center
(“buffer region”) were harmonically restrained to their
experimentally determined positions. The restraints in the buffer
region were increased gradually from 3.0 to 5.0 kcal/mol/Å2 as one moves closer to the outer boundary, leaving the inner
27 Å radius shell fully flexible. A cubic water box (edge length
= 80 Å) was overlaid for solvation, and waters that overlapped
with RIG-I/dsRNA were removed. We deleted the terminal phosphate/s
from 4AY2 and
considered the resulting complex as the initial model of RIG-I bound
5′ pp-dsRNA/5′ p-dsRNA. The MD structures were compared
with the X-ray structures of RIG-I CTD bound 5′ pp-dsRNA and
found them to be essentially the same. The total number of atoms in
our simulation model is about ∼50 100. The number of
water molecules present in our MD is about 15 000. Root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) of the heavy atoms (within 27 Å of simulation
sphere) of the complex with respect to the X-ray structure (PDB 4AY2) is given in Figure S2. Average rmsd was calculated for the
heavy atoms within 27 Å of the simulation sphere, averaging over
the 5 ns MD trajectory with 2 ps interval. The rmsd data suggested
that the MD structures are very similar to the X-ray structure 4AY2. The largest rmsd
for 5′ p-dsRNA bound complex is expected as the models are
generated by deleting the β and γ phosphates from 5′
ppp-dsRNA bound RIG-I (PDB: 4AY2).

Periodic boundary conditions were used to
run MD, using the Particle mesh Ewald method22 for long-range electrostatics, with tinfoil boundary conditions.23,24 A cutoff distance of 16 Å was used to truncate van der Waals
interaction. Temperature and pressure were maintained at 310 K and
1 bar, respectively. The temperature was controlled by using Langevin
dynamics for nonhydrogen atoms with a coupling coefficient of 5 ps–1, and the pressure was controlled by Langevin piston
using the Nose–Hoover method. The CHARMM36 force field25,26 with the TIP3P water model was used.27 Simulations were done with CHARMM28,29 and NAMD30 programs. We performed 275–300 ns of
production dynamics for each simulation model. The simulations involve
250–300 ps of equilibration through a series of short MD runs.
In the first 40 ps of equilibration, the system was heated up to 310
K and then kept fixed throughout the production MD trajectories. At
the initial stage of equilibration, heavy atoms of the inner region
(within 27 Å) were harmonically restrained at their experimentally
resolved position with a force constant of 4.0 kcal/mol/Å2, and at the final stage of equilibration, the restraint from
the inner region was completely removed. The overall charge of the
simulation was neutralized by scaling down the partial charges of
the phosphate backbone of dsRNA. It should be noted that 5′
ppp-dsRNA → 5′ pp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA →
5′ p-dsRNA transformation alters the overall charge of the
complex. The use of tinfoil boundary conditions implemented in NAMD30 ensures that, as the overall charge changes,
a compensating charge density is spread uniformly throughout the simulation
box and does not contribute to the forces.31,32

Protocol for Binding Free Energy Calculation
Relative
binding free energies (ΔΔG) of 5′
ppp-dsRNA/5′ pp-dsRNA/5′ p-dsRNA binding to RIG-I were
calculated by alchemically transforming a terminal phosphate into
a ghost following the horizontal legs of the TC described in Figure 1b. The vertical legs
correspond to RNA binding. On the other hand, horizontal legs correspond
to the alchemical transformation of dsRNA which cannot be realized
experimentally. We computed the free energy change associated with
the phosphate deletion (horizontal arms of Figure 1b) and calculated the relative binding free
energy as ΔΔGbind = ΔGcomp – ΔGfree = ΔGbind(5′ pp-dsRNA)
– ΔGbind(5′ ppp-dsRNA).
A hybrid energy function33−36 (U) was used to represent a mixture
of two endpoint states for a particular horizontal leg (Figure 1b). Coupling coordinate λ
was used to connect two endpoints. Two coupling coordinates, λelec, and λvdW, were used to modify the electrostatic
and van der Waals energy terms, where U = U(λelec, λvdW) = U1 + U2. First MD
simulations gradually remove the atomic charges of the γ-phosphate
of 5′ ppp-dsRNA with simultaneous modification of the β-phosphate
charges to model 5′ pp-dsRNA according to the following equation  where Uelec(5′
ppp-dsRNA) and Uelec(5′ pp-dsRNA)
represent the Coulomb interactions involving 5′ ppp-dsRNA and
5′ pp-dsRNA charges, respectively. Next, we varied the van
der Waals interaction parameter of γ-phosphate of 5′
ppp-dsRNA into those of 5′ pp-dsRNA by modifying the coupling
coordinate λvdW from 1 to 0, and leaving a ghost
phosphate, using  Free energy derivative from
Boltzmann statistics
was calculated as ∂G/∂λ = ⟨∂U/∂λ⟩λ, where λ
= λelec or λvdW and the brackets
“⟨ ⟩” represent averaging over MD trajectory
for a particular value of λ. For the alchemical transformation
of the charges, we used 11 equally spaced λelec values
between 1 and 0 (1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1,
and 0.0). The free energy derivative ⟨∂U/∂λ⟩λ at each window was computed from a finite-difference
estimate. Similarly, the van der Waals interactions were also transformed;
the successive λvdW values were 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7,
0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. Each λ
window simulation lasted for 1–2 nanoseconds, and the data
from last 600 to 1600 ps of each simulation were used for averaging.
Free energy change was calculated using numerical integration method.
The standard trapezoidal method for both the complete electrostatic
stage and the van der Waals stage, down to a λvdW of 0.05, was used to integrate the derivatives. van der Waals free
energy derivative between λvdW = 0.05 to 0, was fitted
to the function A0 λvdW–A1 and then analytically
integrated, where A0 and A1 are adjustable parameters. Uncertainties of the free
energy derivatives at each λ value were estimated by dividing
the trajectory segment (which was used for averaging) into two batches
and taking the deviation of the batch averages. The same is reported
in the manuscript as statistical error. Multiple runs were performed
for each state and the average results obtained from those different
runs are reported in the main text of the manuscript. Each free energy
calculation was based on 24–48 ns of data collection averaged
over 6–12 replicas with different initial velocities (Table S2). Overall, a total of about 1.6 μs
of MD free energy simulations has been done to get good convergence
and reasonable statistical error (1–2 kcal/mol), comparable
to the earlier reported force field uncertainty.36 The λ versus free energy derivatives are shown in Figure S3. Different runs are in excellent agreement
with each other (Figure S3 and Table S3). The uncertainty of overall free energy
change (Table S2) and free energy derivatives
at each of the λ points (Table S3) is well within the acceptable statistical uncertainty.

Results
and Discussion
Biochemical and Structural Views of RIG-I
Binding to dsRNA
RIG-I recognizes 5′ ppp-dsRNA or
5′ pp-dsRNA and
discriminates between host and viral RNA. Biochemical studies have
showed that RIG-I has similar affinity for both 5′ ppp-dsRNA
and 5′ pp-dsRNA, but binding is the weakest with 5′
p-dsRNA.20 Earlier studies indicated that
5′ p-dsRNA fails to induce an antiviral response, which suggests
that ligand binding is necessary but not sufficient for RIG-I activation.11,21 Structural studies11,12,18,19 have revealed that 5′ terminal of
dsRNA is recognized by CTD of RIG-I, primarily by forming a network
of electrostatic interactions. Direct interaction between α
and β phosphates of dsRNA with Lys and His residues of RIG-I
has been confirmed in all the resolved structures11,12,19 (Figure 1c,d). Conflicting literature, however, exists regarding
the interaction between γ phosphate of dsRNA and RIG-I. While
crystal structures of RIG-I CTD bound 5′ ppp-dsRNA complexes
[PDB codes: 3LRN (resolution 2.6 Å),113LRR (resolution 2.15
Å)11] reveal extensive electrostatic
contact between all three phosphates of dsRNA with RIG-I (Figure 1c), another X-ray
structure (PDB: 4AY2 (resolution 2.8 Å)]19 of full RIG-I
(without CARD domain) bound 5′ ppp-dsRNA suggests no interaction
between γ phosphate and RIG-I (Figure 1d), suggesting γ phosphate may not
be a major determinant for viral RNA detection. Still, the possibility
of interaction between γ phosphate and RIG-I has not been ruled
out.19 The controversy related to γ
phosphate interaction with RIG-I is based on the slightly different
orientation of γ phosphate in the complex (Figure 1c,d).

We aligned some
of the high resolution X-ray structures of RIG-I bound 5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA,
and the results are given in Table S1.
The CTD of RIG-I in all the structures is very similar within an rmsd
of 0.8–1.1 Å, including the loop region. Comparison of
RIG-I CTD in the free and 5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA bound structures
(Table S1) does show noticeable conformational
changes for the loop region (rmsd 3.2–9.9 Å). The loop
region of unbound RIG-I CTD (dsRNA-free) is known to be highly flexible
in solution,10 and dsRNA binding might
stabilize specific conformation of the loop. 5′ p-dsRNA bound
RIG-I structure has not yet been resolved experimentally. It is worth
mentioning that none of the resolved structures of the RIG-I:dsRNA
report the presence of divalent metal ion, for example, Mg2+ bound to the terminal phosphate/s of dsRNA. It should be noted that
water molecules deposited in the PDB files may result from misinterpretation
of the electron-density maps of Mg2+. Thus, we analyzed
the water molecules present in the X-ray structures 3LRR(11) (RIG-I CTD:5′ ppp-dsRNA) and 3NCU(12) (RIG-I CTD:5′ pp-dsRNA). Interestingly a water molecule
(with an average beta factor > 45 Å2) is present
in
close proximity to an oxygen of the α phosphate (2.7 Å
in 3LRN, 3.4
Å in 3NCU) in both the structures. The large beta factor of the reported water
and its monodentate coordination with the α phosphate suggest
that the binding site is most likely to be Mg2+-free. It
is worth mentioning that both 4AY2(19) and 3NCU(12) were crystallized in the buffer containing MgCl2. Mg2+ has been isolated in the ATPase domain (Figure 1a) along with ADP
in 4AY2;19 however, none of the reported structures resolved
Mg2+ in the 5′ terminal of dsRNA in its RIG-I bound
complex.

Mutagenesis of key residues involved in interaction
with the 5′-phosphates
has shown to affect RNA binding and signaling by RIG-I.11 Structural studies11,12,18,19 further revealed
that the CTD of RIG-I primarily interacts with the 5′ terminal
and the backbone of the dsRNA, demonstrating that RIG-I can bind to
dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner.

dsRNA with 5′ ppp,
5′ pp, and 5′ p in Solution
Consideration of
unbound state is essential for understanding the
dsRNA binding to RIG-I. Experiments37 suggest
that ATP4– prefers to exist mainly in [ATP:Mg]2– form with fully deprotonated γ-phosphate along
with trace amounts of [ATPH:Mg]−, [ATP:Mg2], and [ATP]4–. The same is also true for ADP3– and AMP2–. We may assume the same
situation, that is, Mg2+ bound dsRNA is the prevalent species
when free in water. The X-ray structures of RIG-I:dsRNA, however,
have ruled out the possibility of Mg2+ in the complex.
This suggests that binding of 5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA involves Mg2+ dissociation from dsRNA. It is worth mentioning that the
calculations of ΔGcomp (without
bound Mg2+) and ΔGfree (with bound Mg2+) may introduce force field errors in
relative binding free energies (ΔΔG’s, Figure 1b). Alchemical transformation
of 5′ ppp-dsRNA to 5′ pp-dsRNA with bound Mg2+ involves the removal of a single Mg2+:phosphate interaction.
Mg2+ polarizes the electronic cloud,36 and the fixed charge force fields are inaccurate as polarization
effects are only implicitly included. The effect of electronic polarization
by Mg2+ is known36 to cancel
out substantially if Mg2+ is present in both the horizontal
legs of the TC. In this study, however, force field error might be
significant as the Mg2+ bound 5′ ppp/pp/p-dsRNA
is expected to be the prevalent form in the RIG-I free form. Thus,
we first computed relative binding of Mg2+ to dsRNA using
an appropriate TC (Figure 2) and compared with experimental binding data.38 The results are summarized in Table 1. The results clearly indicate
that the calculated relative binding free energies (column 4 of Table 1) are larger compared
to that of free adenosine nucleotide in water (column 5 of Table 1). Experimentally
reported binding constants38 for Mg2+ binding to ATP and ADP (ADP and AMP) gives a standard binding
free energy difference of +2.1 kcal/mol favoring ATP (+2.5 kcal/mol
favoring ADP). These binding free energies are expected to be close
to the calculated ΔΔG’s (column
4, Table 1). Thus,
the force field gives large error by overestimating Mg2+:phosphate binding because of the lack of explicit electronic polarizability.39−41 Fixed charge force field is also known to make errors in accurately
capturing GTP and GDP binding when electrostatic interactions with
a divalent ion are involved.36 Therefore,
to compute the ΔGfree (Figure 1b), we have taken
the experimental Mg2+ binding data (Table 2), such that ΔGfree = ΔG2 + ΔΔGexpt. The MD simulation show that three water
coordinated Mg2+ forms tridentate coordination with β,γ
phosphates of 5′ ppp-dsRNA and α,β phosphates of
5′pp-dsRNA (Figure S4). Mg2+ forms bidentate coordination with the phosphate group of 5′
p-dsRNA, and the coordination sphere of Mg2+ is completed
by coordination with four water molecules (Figure S4).

Figure 2 Thermodynamic cycle for Mg2+:dsRNA binding. Vertical
legs correspond to binding. Horizontal legs correspond to the alchemical
transformation of 5′ ppp-dsRNA to 5′ pp-dsRNA in the
presence (upper horizontal leg) and absence (lower horizontal leg)
of Mg2+. Free energy change for the horizontal legs is
computed using MD free energy simulations. Experimentally reported
standard Mg2+ binding free energies to ATP and ADP have
been considered (expected to be very close to Mg2+ binding
to 5′ ppp-dsRNA/5′ pp-dsRNA) to quantify the force field
error. ΔG1 – ΔG2 = ΔGbind[5′ pp-dsRNA:Mg2+] – ΔGbind[5′ ppp-dsRNA:Mg2+] ≈ ΔGbind[ADP:Mg2+] – ΔGbind[ATP:Mg2+].

Structure-Based
Energetics of dsRNA Binding to RIG-I
To compute the dsRNA
discrimination by RIG-I and elucidate the effect
of different dsRNAs (i.e., 5′-ppp, 5′-pp and 5′-p)
on the selectivity, we carried out extensive MD free energy (MDFE)
simulations of RIG-I:dsRNA complexes (5′-ppp or 5′-pp
or 5′-p) using the X-ray structure (PDB 4AY2)19 as the template. We computed the change in binding affinity
for dsRNA upon 5′ ppp → 5′ pp → 5′
p mutations in the RIG-I bound complex. Relative binding free energies
are summarized in Table 2. The results suggest that RIG-I imposes a very high energetic penalty
of about 9 kcal/mol for binding 5′ p-dsRNA with respect to
5′ ppp-dsRNA, which corresponds to a probability of 10–7 relative to binding 5′ ppp-dsRNA. Interestingly
RIG-I selectivity between 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA
was predicted to be weak with a binding free energy difference of
2 kcal/mol, favoring 5′ ppp-dsRNA. This corresponds to a read-through
frequency as high as 10–2 for dsRNA(5′-pp)
with respect to dsRNA(5′-ppp). Biochemical studies indeed suggested
RIG-I could be activated by 5′ ppp-dsRNA or 5′ pp-dsRNA
but not by 5′ p-dsRNA.20

Comparison
between MD and X-ray Structures
The rmsd
of the heavy atoms of about 1.3–1.8 Å with respect to
the X-ray structure suggests that the simulated structures agree well
with the X-ray structure (Figure S2). Robust
features of our MD simulations are as follows:(a) γ-Phosphate
of 5′ ppp-dsRNA
forms direct electrostatic interaction with the positively charged
lysine side chains of RIG-I (Figure 3a). The MD structures of the binding pocket are almost
identical to their corresponding X-ray structures (Figure 3 and Table 3).

(b) The loop region (residue 847–853)
is highly flexible (Figure 4a); however, the interactions between loop residues and 5′
terminal phosphates of dsRNA remain intact throughout the simulations
(Figure 3). Phe853
stabilizes the complex by hydrophobic interaction with either G1 or
C20, moving parallel to the 5′ terminal base pair G1-C20.

(c) 5′ ppp/pp/p-dsRNA
binding to
RIG-I is associated with desolvation of 5′ terminal of dsRNA
(Figure 4b).

Structure and Dynamics of the RIG-I:5′
ppp-dsRNA Complex
The structures from MD simulations agree
well with the corresponding 4AY2 crystal structure
(Figure 3a and Table 3). The rmsd of main
chain and side chain heavy atoms is 0.82 ± 0.1 and 1.68 ±
0.15 Å, respectively, with respect to 4AY2. The 5′ triphosphate binding pocket
is located at the positively charged patch of RIG-I (Figure 3a), and the structural details
are summarized in Table 3. Five lysines, two histidines, and one phenylalanine form the binding
pocket for 5′ triphosphate (Figure 3a). Direct interaction between α phosphate
and Lys888 was observed with a mean O–NZ distance of 2.67 ±
0.1 Å. Lys861 interacts simultaneously with α and β
phosphate with a mean O–NZ distance of 2.72 ± 0.1 and
2.77 ± 0.13 Å, respectively. β phosphate is further
stabilized by interacting with the side chains of Lys858 (mean O–NZ
distance of 2.68 ± 0.1 Å) and His847 (mean O–NE2
distance of 2.75 ± 0.21 Å). Lys858 interacts with 5′
G1 with an average distance of 2.89 ± 0.18 Å. Deviation
of γ phosphate of 5′ ppp-dsRNA with respect to the X-ray
structure is shown in Figure 3a; it is forming direct electrostatic contact with the side
chains of Lys849, Lys 851, and Lys858. γ phosphate of dsRNA
forms bidentate coordination with Lys849 (an average O–NZ distance
of 3.1 ± 0.2 and 2.95 ± 0.67 Å) and Lys851 (an average
O–NZ distance of 2.7 ± 0.23 and 3.03 ± 0.4 Å),
and a monodentate coordination with Lys858 (an average O–NZ
distance of 2.6 ± 0.4 Å). Phe853 stacks over the terminal
G1-C20 base pair, and His830 forms hydrogen bond with the ribose −OH
of G1 with an average distance of 2.8 ± 0.18 Å. MD trajectory
shows the movement of Phe853 parallel to the G1-C20 base pair and
stacking with both G1 and C20 bases (Figures 3a and S5). The
water density around the γ phosphates of free and RIG-I bound
dsRNA is shown in Figure 4b. On average, the γ phosphate of 5′ ppp-dsRNA
is solvated with six and eight water molecules in RIG-I bound and
free forms, respectively. Thus, in the binding pocket, the availability
of water is reduced by two water molecules.

Structure and Dynamics
of the RIG-I:5′ pp-dsRNA Complex
We deleted the γ
phosphate of the RIG-I:5′ ppp-dsRNA
complex (4AY2) and considered that as our model for 5′ pp-dsRNA bound RIG-I.
In our model, the helicase domain is present which is absent in the
X-ray structure of 5′ pp-dsRNA bound RIG-I complex (PDB 3NCU).12 MD structures show that G1-RIG-I interactions are almost
identical to the crystal structure (PDB: 3NCU).12 Structural
details are summarized in Figure 3b and Table 3. With respect to the 4AY2, the deviations are 1.06 ± 0.14
Å for the main chain and 1.76 ± 0.08 Å for side chains.
Direct interactions of α and β phosphates of dsRNA with
Lys888, Lys861, His847, and Lys858 have been observed (with an average
distance ranging between 2.62 and 3.28 Å; standard deviation
of less than 0.7 Å). The overall charge of −3 of the terminal
G1 is neutralized by side chains of three lysine residues. His830
and Lys858 form hydrogen bonds with the ribose −OH and N7 of
G1 with an average distance of 2.8 ± 0.12 and 2.92 ± 0.13
Å, respectively. Movement of Phe853 parallel to the 5′
terminal base pair G1-C20 has also been observed in the MD trajectory.
Desolvation of 5′ pp-dsRNA (similar to 5′ ppp-dsRNA)
has been observed upon binding to RIG-I (Figure S6).

Structure and Dynamics of the RIG-I:5′
p-dsRNA Complex
The RIG-I:5′ p-dsRNA structure is
not known experimentally.
We have deleted β and γ phosphates from 4AY2 and considered that
as the MD model. The average rms deviations for main chain and side
chain heavy atoms are 1.1 ± 0.28 and 1.97 ± 0.16 Å,
respectively, with respect to the starting MD model. Structural parameters
of the RIG-I:5′ p-dsRNA complex are given in Figure 3c and Table 3. The absence of β and γ phosphates
leads to the loss of interaction with RIG-I. The only interaction
between His830 and ribose −OH of G1 remains intact as seen
in RIG-I:5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA complexes. The average distance of
3.4 ± 0.38 Å between Lys888 and α phosphate of 5′
p-dsRNA suggests weak interaction. Similar loop flexibility (Figure S5) as seen in RIG-I bound 5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA
has been observed. Binding of 5′ p-dsRNA to RIG-I is associated
with desolvation (Figure S6) as also seen
in 5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA. MD suggests that binding of 5′ p-dsRNA
to RIG-I is unfavorable because of the loss of direct interactions
between 5′ p-dsRNA and RIG-I.

Understanding the RIG-I:dsRNA
binding is a difficult challenge. Multiple RIG-I conformations (bound/unbound
states) and multiple dsRNA species (e.g., different protonation states
of dsRNA with bound/unbound ions and its RIG-I bound/unbound conformations)
contribute to the overall binding process. Despite recent biochemical
studies and medium resolution structures, we are far away from understanding
the structure-based detailed energy landscape associated with viral
RNA recognition. Measuring the binding free energy between a specific
nucleotide and a particular protein conformation is an extremely difficult
task. MD simulations can only fill the gap to some extent. Using MDFE
simulations, we calculated 5′ ppp-dsRNA/5′ pp-dsRNA/5′
p-dsRNA binding free energy differences. The calculated strength of
discrimination, ΔΔG ≈ 9 kcal/mol,
suggests that 5′ ppp-dsRNA binding to RIG-I is strongly favored
with respect to 5′ p-dsRNA. On the other hand, small ΔΔG ≈ 2 kcal/mol suggests that 5′ ppp-dsRNA
binding to RIG-I is weakly favored with respect to 5′ pp-dsRNA.
Because the magnitude of the relative preferences (ΔΔG) is not known experimentally, the calculated MDFE values
cannot be confirmed or disproved. Certainly, the signs are correct
and corroborates the experiment.20

X-ray and NMR structures suggest that the loop region (residue
847–853) of free RIG-I is highly flexible,10 and dsRNA binding might lead to stabilization of specific
conformation of the RIG-I loop.11 The average
value of B-factor of the loop region (residue 847–853) of our
template PDB 4AY2 is 85 Å2, indicating considerable movement. MD simulations
suggest that the loop region (residue 847–853) is flexible
and can have multiple conformations (Figures 4a and S5) even
in the dsRNA bound state. The key interaction between the loop side
chains and 5′ terminal of dsRNA are, however, retained throughout
the MD trajectory (Figure 3a,b and Table 3). The direct interaction between Lys858 and N7 of 5′ terminal
base of dsRNA (Figure 3, Table 3) is very
specific to purines and might disfavor pyrimidines at the 5′
end. Almost all the interaction distances in the MD structures agree
with their corresponding X-ray structures (Table 3), except for the fact that γ phosphate
of 5′ ppp-dsRNA establishes a direct contact with the RIG-I
(absent in template PDB 4AY2). MD results are in agreement with the X-ray structures
of RIG-I CTD bound 5′ ppp-dsRNA, revealing direct electrostatic
interactions between RIG-I and γ phosphate of dsRNA.11,42 It might appear that γ phosphate is a crucial recognition
determinant and RIG-I should strongly favor 5′ ppp-dsRNA binding
with respect to 5′ pp-dsRNA. Experiments,20 however, have clearly shown that RIG-I discriminates weakly
between 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA. 5′ pp-dsRNA
is the minimum requirement for RIG-I binding and antiviral response.
To understand dsRNA binding, consideration of unbound state is essential.
Free 5′ ppp/pp-dsRNA with bound Mg2+ is expected
to be the prevalent species. Structural studies suggest that 5′
ppp/pp-dsRNA in the RIG-I bound form does not have Mg2+, indicating that Mg2+ detachment might be required for
dsRNA binding to RIG-I. It is evident from the structures that the
negatively charged 5′ terminal of dsRNA is neutralized in the
RIG-I binding pocket through extensive electrostatic interaction,
justifying the absence of Mg2+ in the binding pocket. Structures
of the binding pocket from MD simulations are very similar to their
X-ray structures (Figure 4, Table 3,
and Figure S2), suggesting that the starting
structure of the complex (without Mg2+) is a true minimum
in the potential energy hypersurface. MD further revealed that dsRNA
binding to RIG-I is associated with desolvation. The RIG-I binding
site is water-exposed, and the extent of desolvation seems to be similar
for 5′ ppp/pp/p-dsRNA binding (Figures 3a and S6). The
results suggest that desolvation is crucial for binding but may not
be significant toward relative binding preference. It should be noted
that the dissociation constants for the Mg2+:AMP2–, Mg2+:ADP3–, and Mg2+:ATP4– complexes are Kd = 1.622
× 10–3, 2.239 × 10–5, and 6.607 × 10–7 M at room temperature (298.15
K) and pressure (1 atm); the standard binding free energies (ΔGbind0) are −3.8, −6.3, and −8.4 kcal/mol, respectively.38 Clearly the energetic cost for Mg2+ dissociation is the highest from ATP4– > ADP3– > AMP2– for electrostatic reason.
We may expect the same is true for dsRNA containing 5′ phosphate/s;
hence, interaction between dsRNA and RIG-I in the binding pocket needs
to offset the Mg2+ dissociation penalty from the dsRNA.
Both 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA form an extensive
interaction network in the RIG-I binding pocket. The specificity between
5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA, however, was predicted
to be weak with a binding free energy difference of ∼2 kcal/mol,
favoring 5′ ppp-dsRNA. Interactions between the γ phosphate
of 5′ ppp-dsRNA and lysine side chains in the RIG-I binding
pocket offset the largest Mg2+ dissociation penalty (ΔGbind0 = −8.4 kcal/mol); this might be the reason for weak specificity
between 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA. Strong RIG-I binding
specificity of ∼9 kcal/mol in favor of 5′ ppp-dsRNA
with respect to 5′ p-dsRNA is due to the loss of protein-RNA
interaction in the latter.

The close proximity of His847 to
the negatively charged β
phosphates of dsRNA might stabilize the protonated state of His847.
MD simulations with the RIG-I:5′ ppp-dsRNA complex (with protonated
His847) suggest alternate conformation of His847 (see Figure S7), in which the interaction with β
phosphate is lost and interaction with γ phosphate is formed.
It should be noted that in all the X-ray structures (PDB 3LRR, 3LRN, and 4AY2),11,19 the position of His847 is very much similar and His847 interacts
only with the β phosphate. The alternate conformation seen in
MD simulation with protonated His847 is not supported by X-ray structures.
To the best of our estimate, RIG-I with protonated His847 imposes
a higher energetic penalty of about 3.7 ± 3.2 kcal/mol (relative
to 2.3 ± 2.4 kcal/mol for deprotonated His847) for binding to
5′ pp-dsRNA with respect to 5′ ppp-dsRNA. Biochemical
studies20 have shown that both 5′
ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA can induce an antiviral response.
Hence the magnitude of relative binding affinity ΔΔG (RIG-I binding to 5′ ppp-dsRNA vs 5′ pp-dsRNA)
is expected to be small. The deviation of protonated-His847 (in MD)
with respect to its experimentally determined position, along with
the larger ΔΔG (computed), probably suggests
the deprotonated state of His847.

Conclusions
MD
simulations of RIG-I:5′ ppp-dsRNA, RIG-I:5′ pp-dsRNA,
and RIG-I:5′ p-dsRNA complexes provide crucial insights into
the energetics of viral RNA binding to RIG-I. Extensive interaction
between 5′ terminal of dsRNA and RIG-I is favorable for binding,
whereas desolvation and dissociation of Mg2+ from dsRNA
are unfavorable. The extent of desolvation is very similar for 5′
ppp-dsRNA, 5′ pp-dsRNA, and 5′ p-dsRNA, but the Mg2+ binding free energy is the largest for 5′ ppp-dsRNA
and the smallest for 5′ p-dsRNA. RIG-I binding discriminates
weakly between 5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA with a binding
free energy difference of ∼2 kcal/mol, favoring 5′ ppp-dsRNA.
The favorable interaction between RIG-I and γ phosphate of 5′
ppp-dsRNA in the binding pocket is mostly offset by the higher Mg2+ dissociation penalty, leading to a weak discrimination between
5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ pp-dsRNA. 5′ p-dsRNA is discriminated
strongly by ∼9 kcal/mol with respect to 5′ ppp-dsRNA
due to the loss of interaction between 5′ terminal of 5′
p-dsRNA and RIG-I. In spite of all the limitations (sampling, convergence,
force fields, etc.) associated with MD simulations, the signs obtained
for relative binding free energies (ΔΔG) are correct since RIG-I preferentially binds 5′ ppp-dsRNA/5′
pp-dsRNA with respect to 5′ p-dsRNA. The strength of discrimination
(ΔΔG) appears to be biochemically plausible.
The precise relative binding free energies are not known experimentally
and we hope that our study will encourage experimental verification.
The calculations provide an insight into the RIG-I:5′ p-dsRNA
complex, which has not been characterized experimentally. Our MD simulations
are valuable in linking microscopic structures and free energies,
illustrating RIG-I selectivity for blunt-ended dsRNA with 5′
ppp/5′ pp/5′ p. Binding affinity differences between
5′ ppp-dsRNA and 5′ OH-dsRNA21 is beyond the scope of this paper.

Our preliminary data (on
5′ ppp/OH-dsRNA binding to RIG-I)
calculated using the same strategy are in good agreement with the
experiment,21 and a detailed structure-based
energetics study will be published in another paper. The calculations
suggest that 5′ ppp-dsRNA binding is favored with respect to
5′ OH-dsRNA by about 6.5 kcal/mol, and the loss of protein–ligand
interaction is mainly responsible for the relative binding strength.
Furthermore, in an attempt to quantify the energetic effect due to
the presence of Mg2+ in binding, we will be introducing
Mg2+ into the RIG-I binding pocket. Recent findings43,44 suggest that dsRNA and dsDNA both can induce antiviral response
but the latter does not bind to RIG-I. In future, the methodology
could be used to quantify dsRNA versus dsDNA binding to RIG-I.
