On the basis of a
recent article “Predicting reaction
performance in C–N cross-coupling using machine learning” that appeared in Science, we had decided
to highlight the way forward for artificial intelligence in chemistry.
Synthesis of molecules remains one of the most important challenges
in organic chemistry, and the standard approach involved by a chemist
to solve a problem is based on experience and constitutes a repetitive,
time-consuming task, often resulting in nonoptimized solutions. Thus,
considering the recent phenomenal progresses that have been made in
machine learning, there is little doubt that these systems, once fully
operational in organic chemistry, will dramatically speed up development
of new drugs and will constitute the future of chemistry.

Introduction
In 1956, the “Forbidden Planet”
movie starred the
iconic sci-fi character Robby, the robot whose impressive ability
to synthesize almost everything was undoubtedly inspirational for
generations of young chemists. Did Robby foreshadow the development
of artificial intelligence (AI) in chemistry?

Synthesis of organic
molecules remains one of the most important
tasks in organic chemistry, and the standard approach involved by
a chemist to solve a problem is based on experience, heuristics, and
rules of thumb. When chemists manually design a new drug, they need
to not only design a target molecule but also need to look at the
reaction pathways to synthesize it. Chemists usually work backward,
starting with the molecule they want to create and then analyzing
by a process known as retrosynthesis in which readily available reagents
and sequences of reactions could be used to produce it. This process
is time-consuming and often results in nonoptimized solutions or even
failure in finding reaction pathways because of human errors.

Results
and Discussion
AI is not a new field of research in organic
chemistry, as chemists
have been using computers for years in their daily work and are quite
willing to accept the aid of a computer (Figure 1).1 Preliminary
research studies started for more than five decades ago with the DENDRAL
project2 even if for many people it is
still just a buzz word associated with no real applications. In this
context, Corey and Wipke envisioned that both synthesis and retrosynthesis
could be designed by a machine using handcrafted rules known as reaction
templates.3 However, a deep chemical expertise
was still required, and writing rules remained a time-consuming task.

Figure 1 Oversimplified
vision of AI in the collective unconscious.

In the early days of AI approach for chemistry, candidate
products
were generated from the templates and then were scored according to
their plausibility.4,5 However, this kind of approach
is fundamentally dependent on the rule-based system component and
does not lead to accurate predictions outside of the training domain.
Lehn considered: “atoms as letters, molecules as words, supramolecular
entities as sentences (...)”, and some researchers tried to
show that organic chemistry has a structure similar to a natural language
and that the concepts of linguistic-based analysis could be used to
analyze molecules, their patterns of reactivity, and their organic
synthesis.6−8 On the other hand, we can cite the work of Kayala
et al. who look at mechanistic steps,9 whereas
Liu et al. and Nam et al. use sequence-to-sequence models for retrosynthesis
and reaction prediction.10,11

The task of finding
pathways in chemistry focuses on the best combination
of moves leading to a solution and finds the most promising strategy
or pathway. It is a bit like a solitaire game where the game pieces
on the board at the beginning of the game would be the precursor molecules,
and the only piece that remains at the end of a winning game would
be the target molecule. During the game, the movements of the pieces
correspond to the reactions applicable to the precursor molecules
allowing to progress toward the synthesis of the target molecule;
an inadequate combination of moves will prematurely stop the game.
In 2016, using fingerprints learned with a neural network algorithm,
Wei et al. identified with more than 80% accuracy the reaction type
in the scope of alkene and alkyl halide reactions (Figure 2A). This algorithm is able
to learn the probabilities of a range of reaction types, and most
importantly, its predictive capabilities can increase with the size
of the libraries of training data. This algorithm constituted a step
toward the goal of developing a learning machine devoted to the automatic
synthesis planning of organic molecules.12 One year later, a learning machine combining a novel model framework
for generating and ranking candidate reaction outcomes and a novel
edit-based representation was used by Coley et al. to reproduce in
silico the qualitative results of actual experimental reactions. This
unique framework combining candidates with more direct relevance to
chemical reactivity was improved and expanded to achieve high predictive
performance (Figure 2B).13 In the same year, using the dataset
previously used by Jin et al.,14 a team
at IBM15 adopted another innovative approach
by creating a tool to solve the forward-reaction prediction problem
where the starting materials are known, and the interest is in generating
the products. By using such an approach, the team fed chemical components
into a neural network trained on a dataset of 395 496 reactions. The
neural network then used what it had learned about prior reactions
to predict about what would occur under new experimental conditions.
The system responded to such requests by offering a list of the most
plausible results. Testing showed that the top prediction turned out
to be correct 80 percent of the time. Further to these works dealing
with forward prediction, Segler et al. focused his attention on retrosynthesis
and developed a new deep-learning neural network that considered around
12.4 million of known single-step chemical reactions and allowed the
prediction of the reactions that can be used in any single step of
a multistep synthesis.16 This program can
deconstruct the considered molecule until it ends up with readily
available starting reagents. A first neural network determines the
search in promising directions by proposing fewer transformations.
A second one predicts whether the selected reactions are feasible,
whereas a third one samples the transformations during the implementation
phase. Simultaneously, by considering the low data regime and calculating
theoretical properties of the reactants and reagents, Ahneman et al.
predicted reaction performance in palladium Buchwald–Hartwig
C–N cross-coupling reactions in the presence of various potentially
inhibitory additives with machine learning in multidimensional space
using data obtained via high-throughput experimentation.17 This methodology is based on scripts that extract
various molecular descriptors, subsequently used as inputs in the
model, whereas reaction yields were considered as outputs. Random
forest algorithms operate by randomly sampling the data, and an overall
prediction is generated by constructing aggregated decision trees.
It was demonstrated that these algorithms led to significantly improved
performance over linear regression analysis. Very recently and after
more than 10 years of research, Klucznik et al. developed the highly
effective Chematica computer program capable of designing novel efficient
syntheses of medicinally relevant molecules.18 This was realized by a subtle analysis of its scoring functions
and the comparison with large numbers of logically related criteria,
for example, selectivity or reactivity. All these lead Chematica to
be able to rapidly propose optimized synthetic pathways for the design
of molecules of interest.

Figure 2 (A) Reaction fingerprint is the input for a
neural network predicting
the probability of numerous different reaction types as well as a
potent product formation, by applying to the reactants a transformation
that corresponds to the most probable reaction type (ref (8)). (B) Model framework combining
forward enumeration and candidate ranking (ref (9)).

All these different intelligent search algorithms have proven
their
effectiveness in providing chemists with realistic solutions for molecule
synthesis. Undoubtedly, the collaboration of all these algorithms
would bring an even better predictive relevance to the proposed solutions.

Some chemists may find this provocative, but chemistry considered
as an isolated entity without relevant application is not useful and
the considerable progresses of AI in this area (summarized above)
do not change that.

However, chemistry reaches a whole new dimension
when it has applications
in other disciplines like in biology or physics of materials. Of course,
AI has also infiltrated these disciplines. In biology, for example,
the Omics revolution requiring big data mining has been the major
driving force behind the development of AI. Beyond that application,
in 2015, an AI system developed for biology has successfully inferred
the first systems-biology comprehensive dynamical model explaining
patterning in planarian regeneration.19 A combination of AI systems developed for chemistry and biology
that would be able to synthesize new molecules effective on new therapeutic
targets to cure diseases would be a rather optimistic view of a near
future. Already some researchers are turning to AI to design and carry
out experiments to prospect for fully automated science. However,
in the interest of human intelligence and for the social acceptance
of AI (in all areas), we believe that an advisable evolution would
be for AI to become the investigator’s collaborator, bringing
him new solutions, but also explains to him how it came to these conclusions.
The Google’s AI program Alphazero made obsolete the maxim that
says that “it takes few minutes to learn to play chess and
a human lifetime to become a master”.20 Indeed, knowing only the rules of the chess game, Alphazero needed
just few hours of self-learning to develop an adventurous and unconventional
way of playing that allowed it to beat human masters or existing programs.
In the same way, and even if the “chemistry game” is
more complex than the chess game,21 the
recent phenomenal progresses that have been made in machine learning
will undoubtedly dramatically speed up development of new drugs.

Conclusions
Even though today no new drug has been synthesized using AI, experts
agree that the commercial issues in this area are enormous.22 AI will not replace chemists at least in the
short term, but AI clearly appears as the future of chemistry.23−25
