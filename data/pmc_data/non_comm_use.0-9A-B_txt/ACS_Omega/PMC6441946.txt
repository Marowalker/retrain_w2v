The Rep and UvrD
DNA helicases are proposed to act at stalled DNA
replication forks to facilitate replication restart when RNA polymerase
stalls forks. To clarify the role of these DNA helicases in fork rescue,
we used a coupled spectrophotometric ATPase assay to determine how
they act on model fork substrates. For both enzymes, activity is low
on regressed fork structures, suggesting that they act prior to the
regression step that generates a Holliday junction. In fact, the preferred
cofactors for both enzymes are forks with a gap in the nascent leading
strand, consistent with the 3′–5′ direction of
translocation. Surprisingly, for Rep, this specificity is altered
in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of a single-strand DNA-binding
protein (SSB) relative to a fork with a gap in the nascent lagging
strand. Even though Rep and UvrD are similar in structure, elevated
concentrations of SSB inhibit Rep, but they have little to no effect
on UvrD. Furthermore, Rep and UvrD antagonize one another at a fork.
This is surprising given that these helicases have been shown to form
a heterodimer and are proposed to act together to rescue an RNA polymerase-stalled
fork. Consequently, the results herein indicate that although Rep
and UvrD can act on similar fork substrates, they cannot function
on the same fork simultaneously.

Introduction
The faithful duplication
of the genome is inherently accurate and
highly processive. To achieve this, there is a strong reliance on
the interplay between the homologous recombination and DNA repair
machinery.1−3 The need for this interplay arises because of the
replication machinery frequently encountering roadblocks that have
the potential to stall or collapse a replication fork.4−6 Once collapsed, fork rescue requires the actions of the recombination
machinery. The types of impediments that could disrupt replication
include proteins bound to the DNA ahead of the replication fork, noncoding
lesions in the template DNA, and either single- or double-strand breaks.3,7,8 One of the most common forms of
roadblocks is those presented by proteins bound to the DNA such as
RNA polymerase and Tus.9,10

Recent studies have shown
that in Escherichia coli, the RecG
helicase catalyzes stalled replication fork regression
in a reaction that is facilitated by the single-strand DNA (ssDNA)
binding protein (SSB).11−15 Even though RecG can work against opposing forces as large as 35
pN and can readily displace SSB from the nascent gapped leading and
lagging strands, it may not be involved in dealing with the removal
of stalled RNA polymerases as suggested previously.16,17 This makes sense because RecG drives fork regression in a direction
away from the stalled enzyme/protein, causing the impediment to replication.14 Consequently, other proteins, likely helicases
or at a minimum translocases, should instead be important for displacement.

Candidates that have been suggested include the replisome itself,
RNA polymerase modulators including DksA, ppGpp, and the Mfd protein
(which is similar to RecG at the primary amino acid sequence level),
and three DNA helicases: Rep, DinG, and UvrD.16,18 Of particular interest to our work are these three DNA helicases,
which were shown genetically to be required for stalled replication
fork rescue in highly transcribed regions.19 Here, it was proposed that helicase combinations Rep + DinG and
separately, Rep + UvrD, are critical for the removal of the multiple
RNA polymerase molecules impeding fork progression.

The Rep
protein was the first helicase to be discovered in E. coli, where it was shown to be required for the
replication of genomes of several phages such as ϕX174.20−22 The enzyme is a member of helicase Superfamily 1. It possesses a
3′ → 5′ DNA helicase activity, unwinding DNA
with a limited processivity of ≤400 bp.23−25 Although it
is monomeric in solution, it dimerizes upon binding to DNA, and this
may be required for its helicase activity, although this is a hotly
debated issue.26−28 Although Rep is necessary for the replication of
a number of phage replisomes, it is not required for replication initiating
at oriC in vitro.29 DNA
synthesis occurs in cells lacking Rep, consistent with Rep not being
the replicative DNA helicase. However, replication does proceed at
a reduced rate, and the average number of replication forks per cell
increases in rep mutants.30,31 Recent work demonstrates that even though Rep is not the replicative
helicase, it associates with DnaB to provide an additional helicase
motor at the fork.32,33 Thus, unless DnaB dissociates
when forks stall taking Rep with it, then this helicase may function
to facilitate the rescuing of stalled forks as proposed.19,33

The UvrD protein or Helicase II is a member of helicase Superfamily
1 and functions in methyl-directed mismatch and nucleotide excision
repair.34,35 The UvrD helicase is 82 kDa in size and
can initiate DNA unwinding from ssDNA tails and gaps, proceeding in
the 3′ to 5′ direction and with limited processivity.
It can also initiate unwinding from both nicks and blunt ends, but
this requires significantly higher concentrations of enzyme.36−38 UvrD can also separate RNA–DNA hybrids, which it does so
more efficiently than DNA–DNA substrates.39,40 Single-molecule studies have revealed an unusual strand-switching
property of the enzyme that may assist UvrD in clearing proteins bound
to both strands of the DNA.41 This strand
switching involves DNA unwinding in the 3′ to 5′ direction,
followed by a switch to the opposite strand with the resumption of
translocation, leading to reannealing of the unwound strands.

Not surprisingly, UvrD can displace proteins bound to duplex DNA
including Lac repressor bound to its operator, topoisomerase IV from
a nascent cleaved DNA substrate, and Tus bound to a ter site.42−44 Furthermore, UvrD can also displace RecA from ssDNA,
whereas Rep cannot.45−48 This displacement takes advantage of the processive ssDNA translocation
activity of UvrD.49 The distinct actions
of Rep and UvrD on RecA filaments suggest that Rep and UvrD do not
share a common essential activity in vivo as previously suggested.50 Instead, Rep has been proposed to function in
DNA replication, whereas UvrD functions as an antirecombinogenic motor
and has a role in stalled replication fork clearing.51

To understand how the Rep and UvrD helicases act
at stalled replication
forks, we have performed a careful steady-state kinetic analysis of
the ATPase activity of these enzymes both separately and together
in the presence of two groups of forked DNA substrates, identical
to what we used previously for RecG and RuvAB.15,52,53 The first group mimics nascent stalled DNA
replication forks, whereas the second group mimics regressed forks
(Table 1). In addition,
these experiments were done in the presence and absence of SSBs.

b DNA
molecules are drawn in standard
orientation, with the top strand having its 5′ end on the left.
For the HJ, this is the top left strand.

Results show that UvrD exhibits significant ATPase
activity in
the presence of forks, in particular, its preferred fork is one which
has a gap in the nascent leading strand. Remarkably and consistent
with its role as a fork clearing enzyme, it is resistant to inhibition
by SSB and to monovalent cations when acting at a fork. The results
also show that Rep prefers forks with a gap in the nascent leading
strand consistent with the 3′ to 5′ direction of translocation
for this enzyme. Surprisingly, this preference is altered in the presence
of a stoichiometric SSB–Rep ratio, relative to a fork with
a gap in the nascent lagging strand instead. When the concentration
of SSB is higher, Rep is completely inhibited however, suggesting
that under SOS conditions, the enzyme may have little to no role in
DNA repair. Finally, and even though Rep and UvrD can form a heterodimer
in vitro,54 we show that these two enzymes
cannot function simultaneously on the same fork as they antagonize
one another. Collectively, the data suggest that for these helicases
to function in fork rescue they act prior to the regression step.
Furthermore, and as they antagonize one another, they must act either
at different times or at different sites on the fork or process DNA
sequentially.

Results
ATPase Activity of Each
Helicase Is DNA Substrate-Dependent
In the experiments herein,
N-terminally histidine-tagged UvrD and
Rep were used. Analysis of the crystal structures reveals that the
positioning of these tags should not impair enzyme function as the
enzyme N-termini (thus the tags) are far from both the DNA and ATP-binding
pockets (Supporting Information, Figure
1 and refs55,56). The data presented below demonstrate that the activity of his
enzymes is within the experimental error, the same as that of the
untagged proteins.57−59

To determine whether UvrD and Rep are active
at a stalled DNA replication fork, we assessed the steady-state ATPase
activity of each enzyme in the presence of DNA structures that may
form at the fork itself. These model substrates, shown schematically
in Table 1, are formed
by annealing purified oligonucleotides, resulting in a fork with flayed
ends (fork 1), forks with one ssDNA arm (fork 2 where the lagging
strand is ssDNA or fork 3 where the leading strand is ssDNA), a fork
with two duplex arms (fork 4), and finally a Holliday junction (HJ,
fork 5). Forks 1–3 which contain one or more ssDNA arms comprise
group I and are thought to mimic nascent stalled replication fork
structures. Fork 4 and the HJ, which contain duplex DNA arms, are
assigned to group II as they are thought to mimic regressed fork structures.
These junction DNAs contain a homologous core of 24 bp flanked by
heterologous sequences so that each helicase can mediate unwinding
of the substrates (Supporting Information, Figure 2, data not shown and refs60−62).

Our work and that of others characterizing the fork helicases
RecG
and RuvAB demonstrated that these helicases hydrolyze ATP under a
variety of reaction conditions.15,52,53 In particular, optimal ATPase activity was observed at different
magnesium ion concentrations for each enzyme, with the optimum dictated
by the DNA cofactor present. To determine whether Rep and UvrD helicases
displayed a similar behavior, we first examined ATPase activity in
the presence of each fork substrate as a function of magnesium ion
concentration. Under these conditions, Rep displayed optimal activity
at 0.5 mM magnesium ion, whereas UvrD exhibited optimal activity at
1 mM (Figure 1A,B).
There was one exception to this trend, that is, Rep activity in the
presence of fork 3. Here, a broad maximum between 0.5 and 5 mM decreasing
only slightly at 10 mM was observed (Figure 1A). As optimal activity was observed for
Rep at 0.5 mM magnesium acetate and for UvrD at 1.0 mM, all subsequent
experiments were done at the optimum for each enzyme.

Figure 1 ATPase activity of Rep
and UvrD is Mg2+-dependent and
influenced by the DNA substrate. (A,B) Optimum activity for each helicase
occurs at low magnesium ion concentration. (A) Titration of MgOAc
for Rep in the presence of forks 1–5 is shown. All assays were
done as described in Materials and Methods and contained a mixture of reaction buffer, 1 mM ATP, 100 nM fork
substrates, and 10 nM helicase. Magnesium acetate was added to initiate
the activity, with additional magnesium ions being added to reach
the desired concentration after the hydrolysis rate reached a steady-state
rate. (B) Effects of MgOAc concentration on UvrD. In these assays,
fork substrates were present at 100 nM molecules, and M13 ssDNA was
present at 10 μM nucleotides. Reactions contained 10 nM UvrD
and 1 mM ATP. 2–5 assays were done on separate days. (C,D)
Comparison of the effects of different DNA substrates on the ATPase
activity of each helicase. (C) Rep and (D) UvrD. Reactions were done
as described in Materials and Methods and
contained either 10 nM Rep or UvrD and 1 mM ATP. The concentration
of MgOAc was 0.5 mM for assays with Rep and 1 mM for UvrD. Details
of the structures of forks 1–4 and the HJ are shown in Table 1. In these assays,
M13 ssDNA was present at 10 μM nucleotides and linear double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) was present at 2.3 nM ends (10 μM nucleotides),
and fork substrates were present at 100 nM molecules. The data shown
are from assays done in duplicate on the same day. Forks 1–3
were annealed and used without further purification. Fork 4 and the
HJ (fork 5) were purified using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) to ensure that no free single-stranded oligonucleotides remained.

Previous work with UvrD has shown
that the enzyme is promiscuous
with respect to the DNA substrate, being able to unwind forked DNA
molecules as well as plasmid-sized DNA.38,63 This promiscuity
can be explained in part by the requirement for elevated levels of
protein to observe full activity, often in vast excess over that of
DNA, which were used in these studies. This is then complicated by
the propensity of UvrD to form oligomers.64−67 Therefore, experiments were done
at 10 nM UvrD and with 100 nM DNA. Under these conditions, UvrD is
likely to be monomeric as suggested previously.65

Next, we compared the ATPase activity of each helicase
in the presence
of these model forks and at their optimal magnesium ion concentration.
Rep exhibited a very low but detectable ATPase activity in the absence
of DNA with a V/E of 0.3 ± 0.01 min–1 (Figure 1C). In the presence
of linear dsDNA, the ATPase activity increased 10-fold to 2 ±
0.4 min–1. In contrast, in the presence of M13 ssDNA,
the activity increased to 3200 ± 158 min–1.
For the Rep helicase in the presence of group I cofactors, which mimic
a nascent stalled replication fork, the V/E for ATP hydrolysis was
2.5- to 7-fold higher than DNA substrates that mimic a regressed fork
[fork 4 and the HJ (fork 5), Figure 1C]. As Rep possesses an intrinsic 3′ →
5′ DNA helicase activity, the high level of activity in the
presence of fork 1, 1780 ± 70 min–1, was not
surprising.23−25 In this experiment, the ATPase activity in the presence
of forks 2 and 3 was reduced 1.6-fold relative to fork 1 to 1110 ±
50 and 940 ± 20 min–1, respectively. The 4-
to 8-fold lower levels of activity observed for fork 4 and the HJ
suggest that these are likely not the preferred substrates for the
Rep helicase in vivo. These results are consistent with the previous
work showing that the presence of a leading strand at the fork suppresses
the helicase activity of Rep.68 Thus, the
elevated levels of ATPase activity observed for this helicase in the
presence of forks 1 and 3 suggest that the preferred DNA substrate
contains a 3′-ssDNA tail consistent with the 3′–5′
direction of translocation of the helicase.23−25

The high
level of ATPase activity observed in the presence of fork
2 was unexpected as the polarity of the ssDNA arm is opposite that
of the direction of translocation of Rep. However, the fork design
contains a homologous core of 24 bp that could thermally equilibrate
between two forms (Supporting Information, Figure 2). Thus, in one form, this fork will present to Rep as
shown in Table 1, whereas
in the other form, the junction will have moved thereby extruding
a central ssDNA loading site that 3′-end. This may facilitate
the loading of Rep onto this fork.

UvrD exhibited a very low
but detectable ATPase activity in the
absence of DNA with a V/E of 191 ± 13 min–1 (Figure 1D). In the
presence of linear dsDNA 12 kB in size, the activity increased 1.4-fold
to 267 ± 45 min–1. In sharp contrast, in the
presence of M13 ssDNA, the activity increased 26-fold to 4971 ±
59 min–1. On a fork with two single-stranded tails,
UvrD exhibited the highest activity for fork DNAs with a V/E of 2888
± 5 min–1 (Figure 1D). The activity decreased approximately
2-fold to 1689 ± 49 min–1 when the substrate
had a gap in the nascent lagging strand (fork 2). In contrast, when
the gap was present in the nascent leading strand (fork 3), V/E was
higher at 2253 ± 122 min–1, which is only 22%
lower than when both tails of the fork are single-stranded.

Next, we assessed the activity of UvrD on DNA substrates that mimic
a regressed fork (fork 4) and the HJ (fork 5) (Figure 1D and Table 1). As UvrD exhibits a significant activity on ssDNA,
these substrates were purified following annealing to remove free
oligonucleotides. For both substrates, the activity was observed,
but the level was lower than that of any of the substrates in group
I. The activity in the presence of fork 4, which has two duplex arms,
was the highest in this group, producing a V/E of 1536 ± 54 min–1. This activity is 6-fold higher than that observed
on linear plasmid DNA (V/E = 267 ± 45 min–1). A similar elevated level of ATPase activity was observed in the
presence of the HJ (V/E = 1171 ± 7 min–1),
4-fold higher than that of the 12 kB plasmid substrate. The higher
level of activity observed on these DNA molecules relative to linear
plasmid may be due to the higher concentration of dsDNA ends or possibly
an affinity for junction DNA as suggested previously.69

Kinetic Analyses Reveal the Preferred Substrates
for Rep and
UvrD
To further clarify DNA substrate preference, the ability
of UvrD and separately of Rep, to hydrolyze ATP in the presence of
model fork substrates, as a function of increasing DNA and separately,
of ATP concentration, was determined. These experiments were done
at 0.5 (Rep) or 1 mM (UvrD) magnesium ion concentration, 10 nM enzyme,
and 100 nM fork for the ATP titrations. In assays where DNA was varied,
the concentration of ATP was held constant at 600 μM for Rep
and 1 mM for UvrD.

As expected, UvrD is most active in the presence
of M13 ssDNA (Figure 2A and Table 2). The
high Vmax of 62.07 ± 1.73 μM/min
and low S0.5DNA,app of 0.18 ± 0.02 nM result in a catalytic
efficiency of 34 483 min–1 nM–1 (Table 2). The Hill
coefficient for this cofactor is slightly less than unity, indicating
negative cooperativity for the binding of additional ssDNA to UvrD.
The next highest Vmax for UvrD was observed
in the presence of fork 1 (two ssDNA arms), followed closely by fork
3, which has a gap in the nascent lagging strand (Figure 2A and Table 2). Forks 2 and 4 and fork 5 (the HJ) fall
into the next group, where the Vmax is
lower by almost 4-fold, relative to M13 ssDNA. However, when the apparent
affinities for each of the model fork substrates are compared, further
insight is revealed. While UvrD binds tightly to M13 ssDNA (S0.5DNA,app of 0.18 ± 0.02 nM), the KmDNA,app is 20-fold higher for fork
1 which has two ssDNA arms, higher than any of the forks, at 3.55
± 0.18 nM (Table 2A). When only one arm of the forks is single-stranded (forks 2 and
3), the KmDNA, app decreases 1.86- and 1.64-fold,
respectively, relative to fork 1 (Table 2A).

Figure 2 Kinetic analyses reveal fork preferences for
each DNA helicase.
(A,C) DNA titration and (B,D) ATP titration. Data for UvrD are given
in (A,B); data for Rep are given in (C,D). ATPase assays were performed
as described in the Materials and Methods and
were initiated by the addition of protein. Time courses were analyzed
by linear regression to determine the reaction rate, and the resulting
rates were graphed as a function of DNA (A,C) or ATP concentration
(B,D). UvrD and Rep were present at 10 nM. The data presented are
from 2 to 5 experiments per cofactor with assays conducted on separate
days. Data were approximated using the Hill equation (V = (Vmax·[DNA]n)/([S0.5]n + [DNA]n).

a Assays were done as described in Materials
and Methods and contained the optimal
MgOAc for each enzyme, 1 mM ATP, and were initiated by the addition
of 10 nM helicase. For each DNA substrate, 2–6 assays were
done on different days.

b The concentration of M13 ssDNA is
reported in nM nucleotides. For forks 1–5, DNA concentration
is reported in nM molecules.

c To determine whether the Hill or
Michaelis–Menten equation more accurately approximated the
data, a comparison was done using Prism. For Rep, this analysis revealed
that the Michaelis–Menten equation more accurately approximated
the data, whereas for UvrD, the Michaelis–Menten equation was
more accurate for forks 1, 3, and 5, and the Hill equation was more
accurate for forks 2 and 4 and ssM13. The Kmapp (or S0.5app) for DNA is reported in nM molecules.

d NR, not relevant.

The increase in KmDNA,app for forks 1–3 relative to M13
ssDNA results in a significant decrease in the catalytic efficiency
of UvrD. For forks 1 and 2, the catalytic efficiency decreased 42-fold
compared to M13 ssDNA (Table 2). Even though UvrD binds two fork 2 DNAs to achieve full
activity as indicated by the Hill coefficient of 1.53 ± 0.15,
the kcat is still the lowest in group
I and the catalytic efficiency is correspondingly low (Table 2). In contrast, in the presence
of fork 3, the value for kcat/Km is 1131 min–1 nM–1. This is 1.4-fold higher than forks 1 and 2 and can be attributed
to both a high Vmax and low KmDNA,app. In
addition, the Hill coefficient for DNA binding is 1, suggesting that
a UvrD monomer is bound to only one fork 3 to achieve full activity.

Surprisingly, the catalytic efficiency for UvrD observed in the
presence of fork 4 was the highest among the forks studied here, producing
a value of 1910 min–1 nM–1. At
first glance, this can be attributed to the low S0.5DNA, app of 0.81 ± 0.03 nM. However, the Hill coefficient for DNA binding
is 1.49 ± 0.08, suggesting that UvrD is binding two fork 4 molecules
to achieve the elevated level of activity. The Hill coefficient greater
than unity are not due to the presence of contaminating single-stranded
oligonucleotides as annealing for fork 2 was >95% efficient and
fork
4 was purified following annealing (data not shown). It is unclear
how the binding of either two fork 2 or 4 molecules occurs, given
that UvrD is active as a monomer.28,56

Unexpectedly,
and in contrast to previous studies, the HJ is the
poorest fork substrate for UvrD producing a catalytic efficiency of
530 min–1 nM–1 (Table 2A63,69). This is
3.6-fold lower than fork 4, and this difference can be attributed
to the 3-fold higher KmDNA,app. These data suggest that once
a fork has been regressed by RecG, the resulting HJ intermediate is
not a substrate for UvrD.14 In summary,
these data taken collectively suggest that the preferred cofactor
is fork 3, which has a gap in the nascent lagging strand, consistent
with the previous work.64,70 This conclusion makes
sense given that for fork 3, the Hill coefficient is near unity and
the catalytic efficiency is very high.

To understand the DNA
substrate preference further, we next characterized
the steady-state kinetic parameters of UvrD for ATP in the presence
of 100 nM fork DNA or 10 μM nucleotides of M13 ssDNA (Figure 2B and Table 3). As before, UvrD exhibits
the highest catalytic efficiency in the presence of M13 ssDNA, where
a value of 168 min–1 μM–1 was obtained. This value is identical to that observed previously.57 Even though the Hill coefficient for ATP binding
is less than one, the combination of high Vmax and low S0.5ATP results in high catalytic efficiency for
this DNA cofactor.

a Assays
were done as described in Materials and Methods with varying [ATP] and contained
the optimal MgOAc concentration for each enzyme, 100 nM fork substrate
or 10 μM nts of M13 ssDNA, and were initiated by the addition
of 10 nM Rep (A), RepSSB (B), or 10 nM UvrD (C). For each DNA substrate,
assays were done 2–8 times on different days.

b The Michaelis–Menten equation
was used to accurately describe data for each DNA except for fork
2 (Rep only) and M13 ssDNA (UvrD only). These data were more accurately
described by the Hill equation.

c NR, not relevant.

When
the fork substrates were analyzed, UvrD was found to have
the highest catalytic efficiency in the presence of fork 1, followed
by fork 3 with values of 34 and 22 min–1 nM–1, respectively (Table 3A). In contrast to the results obtained in DNA titrations,
UvrD has the lowest catalytic efficiency for fork 4 (9 min–1 nM–1), followed very closely by fork 2. Even though
the kcat observed for fork 4 is reduced
by only a factor of 2 relative to M13 ssDNA, the 7-fold higher KmATP of 229 ± 37 μM results in the low catalytic efficiency.
For each fork DNA substrate, the Hill coefficient for ATP binding
was 1, consistent with the presence of a single binding site for ATP
in a monomeric enzyme.28,56 Collectively, the ATP titration
data suggest that the preferred fork substrate for this DNA helicase
is fork 1, followed closely by fork 3.

When the kinetic parameters
for DNA for Rep were examined, the
catalytic efficiency in the presence of M13 ssDNA was found to be
13 440 min–1 μM–1 (Figure 2C and Table 2B). This value is
a combination of an elevated kcat and very low KmDNA,app. The KmDNA,app we obtain for his-Rep is identical to
that reported by Kornberg et al.58 When
forks 1–3 were analyzed, the catalytic efficiencies for forks
1 and 3 were essentially the same but reduced 38-fold compared to
M13 ssDNA. The catalytic efficiency determined in the presence of
fork 2 was 2-fold lower than forks 1 and 3 and reduced 86-fold relative
to M13 ssDNA. The decrease in catalytic efficiency observed in the
presence of fork DNA molecules is predominantly due to the large decrease
in the apparent affinity for DNA. Experiments using forks 4 and 5
were not done as the activity of Rep was low, and meaningful results
were not obtained on a consistent basis (not shown).

For Rep,
the initial ATP titration experiments included concentrations
as high as 1.5 mM. However, at concentrations >600 μM, the
activity
of this helicase is inhibited (data not shown). Consequently, determination
of kinetic parameters was done using 600 μM ATP as the maximum
concentration. The control DNA cofactor was M13 ssDNA present at 10
μM nucleotides (Table 2B). As for UvrD, Rep is active on M13 ssDNA producing a catalytic
efficiency of 336 min–1 μM–1 (Table 3B). The high kcat/Km value is
the result of high kcat (4070 ± 313
min–1) and low KmATP (12 ± 2.5 μM). These
values are within the range of those reported previously.58 When the ATPase activity in the presence of
the fork DNA substrates was examined, the catalytic efficiency decreased
13- to 30-fold. For forks 1 and 3, the catalytic efficiency values
are the same and slightly higher than that of fork 2. The low kcat/Km for fork
2 is attributed to the high S0.5 value.
In addition, for this fork substrate, negative cooperativity with
respect to ATP binding is observed.

Finally, as the kinetic
parameters we obtain with the his-Rep and
his-UvrD are within the same experimental error as those published
previously,57−59 we conclude that the tag has no discernible effect
on protein activity.

Rep–SSB Complex Has an Altered Fork
Preference
A previous study with RecG and PriA demonstrated
that these helicases
bind to SSB both in vitro and in vivo.11,52,71 To determine whether Rep and SSB or UvrD and SSB
bind in vivo, a dual plasmid expression system was employed as before
where his-tagged SSB and helicase were overexpressed in the same cell.
The resulting cleared cell lysates were applied to nickel columns.
Results show that his-SSB and UvrD do not coelute from the column
(Supporting Information, Figure 3A). In
addition, when tagging was reversed, coelution was not observed (Supporting Information, Figure 3B). Therefore,
UvrD and SSB do not bind to one another in vivo.

In contrast,
and similar to RecG and PriA, his-Rep and SSB were coeluted from the
nickel column, indicating that they bind to one another in vivo (Supporting Information, Figure 3C). The pooled
complex was applied to a Q-sepharose column and again, the proteins
were coeluted. Finally, the pooled fractions from this column were
applied to a ssDNA cellulose column. Results show that only Rep was
eluted between 0.8 and 1.1 M NaCl, consistent with the previous work.59 However, and following extensive washing with
2 M NaCl as described in the Materials and Methods, his-Rep and SSB were coeluted. We designate this pool of protein
as a complex as the two proteins were coeluted off three columns.
The ratio of his-Rep–SSB in the final complex is 1 (Supporting Information, Figure 3C).

At
present, we do not know the significance of the Rep–SSB
complex but proceeded to perform limited kinetic analyses and compared
the results to Rep only experiments. In addition, because SSB is present,
only forks with ssDNA arms were used as DNA cofactors. Finally, to
achieve the same level of Rep in each assay (i.e., ∼10 nM),
the amount of protein added for Rep–SSB was adjusted according
to the results of the analysis of protein titrations on sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)-PAGE comparing the Rep and Rep–SSB complexes
(Supporting Information, Figure 3C).

The results from ATPase assays with forks containing ssDNA arms
show that the Vmax is significantly higher
for Rep–SSB than for Rep only (Figure 3 and Table 3C). In addition, higher concentrations of ATP (up to
1 mM) did not appear to inhibit the helicase in these reactions. Careful
analysis of the graphs in Figure 3 shows that the KmATP is affected by the presence
of SSB. This is more clear when the derived parameters are examined
(Table 3C). In short,
the catalytic efficiency is 2- to 5-fold higher for Rep–SSB
relative to Rep alone. In addition, negative cooperativity with respect
to ATP binding is no longer observed in the presence of fork 2. These
changes are due to the effect SSB has on the Rep helicase itself.
In addition, the DNA substrate preference changes from forks 1 and
3 for Rep only to that of fork 2 for the Rep–SSB complex.

arms. (A) Fork 1, (B) fork 2, and (C) fork 3. Assays were done as
described in the Materials and Methods and
contained 0.5 mM MgOAc, 100 nM fork DNA, and either 10 nM Rep or approximately
10 nM Rep within the Rep–SSB complex. Here, the amount of Rep
added was adjusted following quantitation of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE
gels so that the concentration of Rep was as close to 10 nM as possible
(Supporting Information, Figure 3C). Using
this approach, the [SSB] is also 10 nM (monomer). The results shown
are from 2 to 4 assays done on separate days.

Excess SSB Inhibits Rep Helicase
SSB plays an important
role in dictating enzyme activities at stalled replication forks both
in vivo and in vitro.11,15 Previous studies show that SSB
inhibits RuvAB in the presence of model fork substrates and enhances
the activity of RecG.15,52 To determine whether an excess
of SSB, relative to helicases, enhances or inhibits Rep or UvrD, ATPase
assays were done in the presence or absence of SSBs: bacteriophage
T4 gp32, SSB, and SSBΔC8 (a mutant of SSB lacking the last eight
residues). Gp32 was used in this study as it binds to ssDNA with a
polarity opposite that of SSB (i.e., a 3′-ssDNA tail), and
SSBΔC8 is used to assess whether interactions of the C-terminal
domain of SSB with UvrD or Rep are playing a role in any potential
activity regulation.76 For fork 1, a stoichiometric
amount of SSB relative to DNA (100 nM fork) was 200 nM tetramer, whereas
for forks 2 and 3, this is 100 nM tetramer. Consequently, the ratio
of SSB to helicase was either 20:1 (fork 1) or 10:1 (forks 1 and 3).
In each assay, SSB was added to the DNA prior to initiating the reactions
with either Rep or UvrD. This was done as this is likely the situation
encountered in vivo at a stalled replication fork.

The results
show that the ATPase activity of Rep only on forks 1 and 2 is virtually
eliminated in the presence of SSB or SSBΔC8, whereas gp32 had
no effect (Figure 4A). Inhibition of the ATPase activity by SSB parallels inhibition
of the helicase activity of the enzyme as shown previously.68 In contrast, in the presence of fork 3, a stoichiometric
amount of SSB or SSBΔC8 relative to DNA resulted in only a 2-fold
decrease in ATPase activity. Total inhibition required higher concentrations
of either SSB or SSBΔC8. Further, addition of gp32 resulted
in a 29% reduction in activity in the presence of fork 3 compared
to the Rep only reaction. Next, the effects of SSBs on the Rep–SSB
complex were assessed. As for Rep helicase only, addition of SSB eliminated
the activity in the presence of forks 1 and 2 and reduced ATPase activity
by 50% in the presence of fork 3 (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 Rep is inhibited by excess SSB, whereas UvrD
is not. In these assays,
DNA substrates were present at 100 nM molecules, ATP was at 1 mM,
MgOAc was at 1 mM for UvrD, and 0.5 mM for Rep, and a stoichiometric
ratio of SSB or GP32 relative to DNA was used. This stoichiometry
was determined in intrinsic fluorescence quenching experiments to
be 200 nM SSB tetramer or 200 nM GP32 monomer for fork 1, which has
two ssDNA arms, and 100 nM SSB tetramer or GP32 monomer for forks
2 and 3, which have only one ssDNA arm. In all assays, SSBs were added
first, followed by a 2 min incubation, and then 10 nM helicase was
added to initiate reactions. (A) Rep is severely inhibited by SSB.
The results shown are from duplicate experiments. (B) Purified Rep–SSB
complex is also inhibited by SSB. The results shown are from duplicate
experiments done on the same day. (C) UvrD is not inhibited by SSBs.
The results shown are from 2 to 5 assays done on separate days. Single
SSB refers to stoichiometric SSB relative to fork DNA; double SSB
refers to twice that [protein].

When the effects of SSBs on the ATPase activity of UvrD were
examined,
no effect in the presence of fork 2 was observed (Figure 4C). In contrast, inhibition
by SSB (34–36%) and SSBΔC8 (27–31%) was observed
in the presence of forks 1 and 3. The comparable levels of inhibition
observed for these two SSBs suggest that the C-terminus of SSB is
not involved and that it is a competition for ssDNA binding that is
responsible for the inhibition. This makes sense as UvrD and SSB do
not physically interact and because both SSB and UvrD preferentially
bind forks with 3′-ssDNA tails (Supporting Information, Figures 3 and ref (72)).

As the level of SSB in the cell vastly
exceeds that of UvrD and
SSB had only a minimal effect on the ATPase activity of UvrD, the
effects of SSB and gp32 were studied as a function of increasing protein
concentration. The results show that in the presence of linear dsDNA,
50% inhibition required only 5 nM SSB tetramer (Figure 5A). This result is consistent with the low
levels of ATPase activity observed for UvrD in the presence of linear
dsDNA (Figure 1D).
In contrast, in the presence of M13 ssDNA, 75 nM SSB was required
to produce the same level of inhibition. When the activity of UvrD
in the presence of forks was assessed, a surprising result was obtained
(Figure 5B). The results
show that 376–1607 nM SSB was required to inhibit UvrD by 50%.
SSB preferentially binds to fork 3, and thus, the lowest concentration
of SSB was required to inhibit UvrD in the presence of this fork,
followed by fork 1. Collectively, these results suggest that UvrD
is still able to access forks in the presence of vast excess of the
competitor protein. This finding is consistent with the ability of
UvrD to bind with high affinity to fork substrates.70

on DNA substrates. (A) SSB titration on M13 ssDNA and linear dsDNA.
(B) Comparison of SSB and GP32 titrations in the presence of fork
substrates. In these experiments, 10 nM UvrD was added first to initiate
reactions; 2 min later, either SSB or gp32 was added. Reactions contained
1 mM ATP and 1 mM MgOAc. Forks were present at 100 nM molecules, and
M13 ssDNA and linear dsDNA were present at 10 μM nucleotides.
The resulting rates were calculated from time courses as described
in the Materials and Methods, with the relative
activity expressed as a percent of the hydrolysis rate of UvrD in
the absence of an added SSB. The arrows indicate the protein titration
midpoints. The data presented are from 2 to 5 experiments with assays
conducted on separate days.

SSB Destabilizes UvrD and Rep on DNA Substrates with Single-Stranded
Character
Previously, we demonstrated that SSB stabilizes
the interaction of RecG with ssDNA.15,52,53 This is observed as a 2- to 5-fold enhancement in
the salt-titration midpoint (STMP) of ATPase assays. In contrast,
SSB inhibited RuvAB on similar substrates, and this was shown to involve
an alteration of the ssDNA by SSB so that it becomes a less favorable
substrate for the helicase.15 To determine
how SSB impacts the stability of each helicase–DNA complex,
we examined the STMP of UvrD and separately of Rep in the presence
of various substrates and in the presence or absence of each of the
SSBs.

In the presence of M13 ssDNA, the STMP of UvrD is 68 mM
(Figure 6A). When SSB
or gp32 is present, the midpoint decreases 3- to 4-fold to 19- and
25 mM, respectively. When the activity was assessed on fork 1, the
STMP of UvrD is 136 mM. As for ssDNA, in the presence of SSBs, the
STMP decreases to 104 mM for gp32 and 76 mM for SSB (Figure 6B). In the presence of forks
2 and 3, the results are significantly different. For fork 2, addition
of as little as 20 mM NaCl to the reaction increases the activity
of UvrD and the STMP is at least 350 mM (Figure 6C). Furthermore, in the presence of either
SSB or gp32, the midpoint is affected but only slightly. For fork
3, the STMP is 115 mM NaCl, and the addition of SSBs has no effect
on the midpoint of the titration (Figure 6D).

or absence of SSBs. (A–D) UvrD, (E) Rep, and (F) Rep–SSB.
(A) M13 ssDNA. (B) Fork 1. (C) Fork 2. (D–F) Fork 3. ATPase
assays were performed as described in the Materials
and Methods. For M13 ssDNA (10 μM nucleotides), reactions
were initiated by the addition of either 10 or 50 nM UvrD. The lower
[protein] was used in UvrD only reactions, as the rate in the presence
of 50 nM helicase was too rapid to perform salt titrations. In assays
with SSBs, these were added at 1 μM tetramer for SSB and SSBΔC8
and 1 μM monomer for gp32, prior to the reaction initiation
by UvrD. For forks 1–3, reactions were initiated by the addition
of 10 nM UvrD. In these assays, forks were present at 100 nM molecules.
In reactions with SSB, SSBΔC8, and GP32, proteins were added
to the DNA to a final concentration of either 200 nM (for fork 1)
or 100 nM (forks 2 and 3). The resulting rates were calculated as
described in Materials and Methods with the
relative activity expressed as a percent of the hydrolysis rate of
UvrD in the absence of added NaCl. The arrows indicate the STMP. For
fork 2, the STMP was determined by extrapolation. For each cofactor,
assays were done in duplicate on the same day. The values for each
STMP are indicated in boxes in each panel. (E) SSBs destabilize Rep.
The effect of monovalent cation concentration was only examined for
fork 3 as only a modest level of inhibition was observed in the presence
of SSB. The rate of ATP hydrolysis and STMP were determined as described
in Materials and Methods. These experiments
were done on the same day using the same tube of substrates and proteins.
(F) Rep and Rep–SSB complex are destabilized by exogenous SSB
in the presence of fork 3. All assays were performed as described
in Materials and Methods. When exogenous SSB
was present, it was added first, followed by either Rep or Rep–SSB
after a 2 min incubation at 37 °C. All assays were done in duplicate
on the same day using the same tube of substrates and proteins.

The effects of SSB and SSBΔC8
on the STMP for UvrD are almost
identical on each DNA substrate. This indicates that it is the ssDNA-binding
component of SSB and not the C-terminal tail that is important. Consistently,
we have not been able to detect a physical interaction between UvrD
and SSB (Supporting Information, Figure
3). Finally, the different effects of SSB and gp32 are consistent
with the opposite polarities of ssDNA binding for these proteins.

Because addition of SSB eliminated Rep ATPase activity on forks
1 and 2, only fork 3 could be studied here. In the absence of SSBs,
the STMP was 165 mM (Figure 6E). Addition of gp32 had only a modest effect, decreasing
the STMP to 140 mM. However, the presence of SSB caused a 2-fold reduction
in the STMP to 85 (wild type) or 63 mM (SSBΔC8). Identical results
were obtained using the Rep–SSB complex (Figure 6F). This suggests that in addition to competing
for SSB sites, an excess of E. coli SSB destabilizes Rep on the DNA, similar to what was observed previously
for RuvAB.15

Rep and UvrD Antagonize
One Another on Forks
Previous
work on the UvrD and Rep helicases has shown that the primary amino
acid sequences of these helicases are 40% homologous and they can
form a heterodimer in solution.54 In addition,
the crystal structures superimpose on one another with a root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) of 1.74 Å (data not shown). More recently, a
role has been proposed for their combined actions in the rescue of
stalled replication forks in a highly transcribed region of the chromosome.19 Therefore, to understand how these helicases
might function together at a stalled fork, we mixed UvrD and Rep on
ice for 30 min and then added this mixture to ATPase assays using
forks 1, 2, and 3 as DNA cofactors. Mixing was done with the intent
to form a potential heterodimer.54 ATPase
assays were done in the presence and absence of SSBs, added prior
to the helicase mixture.

The results show that Rep and UvrD
alone are active on each fork as before (Figure 7). Surprisingly, when the Rep–UvrD
mixture was added, the resulting activities were not additive. Instead,
the rate of ATP hydrolysis was inhibited by more than a factor of
2 compared to the individual helicase only reactions. A further surprise
came when the rates in the presence of SSB were compared. As before,
Rep is completely inhibited by SSB or SSBΔC8 in the presence
of forks 1 and 2 and only slightly by gp32 (Figure 7A,B). In contrast, UvrD is only modestly
inhibited. When the activity of the Rep–UvrD mixture was studied,
inhibition was again observed and the level of inhibition was even
greater than that observed in the absence of SSBs, suggesting that
SSB exacerbates the effect of the two enzymes on one another. This
effect was only observed with SSB or SSBΔC8. When the activity
in the presence of fork 3 was assessed, the same level of inhibition
was observed for the Rep–UvrD mixture relative to each helicase
alone (Figure 7C).
However, and in contrast to forks 1 and 2, the presence of SSB did
not result in further inhibition of ATPase activity. The results on
fork 3 are very surprising, given that each helicase translocates
in the 3′–5′ direction, and we had anticipated
that at least on this DNA a higher level of ATPase activity would
be observed for the Rep–UvrD mixture.

one another on fork substrates. A comparison
of the effect of SSBs on Rep, UvrD, and Rep + UvrD mixture in the
presence of fork 1 (A,D), fork 2 (B,E), and fork 3 (C,F). (D–F)
Effects of wtSSB on the STMP of the Rep–UvrD mixture in the
presence of fork 3. UvrD and Rep were mixed together and incubated
on ice for 20 min before being added to initiate the ATP hydrolysis
reaction. The final concentration of each helicase was 10 nM. When
SSB was present, it was preincubated with fork substrates prior to
the addition of helicases. In the presence of fork 1, 200 nM SSB was
used and for forks 2 and 3, 100 nM SSB was present. These experiments
were done on the same day using the same tube of substrates and proteins
to avoid potential complication from variation between preparations.

To understand the antagonistic
interplay of these two helicases
further, salt titrations were performed in the presence and absence
of SSB using forks 1, 2, and 3 as cofactors. In the presence of fork
1, the STMP of Rep–UvrD was 90 ± 3 mM (Figure 7D and Table 4tbl4). This is same as Rep only (92 ±
2 mM; Table 5) and
lower than that of UvrD alone (136 mM). In contrast to Rep only where
the addition of SSB resulted in almost complete inhibition of the
ATPase activity, the presence of SSB had little effect on the STMP
of Rep–UvrD (Figure 7D). In the presence of fork 2, the STMP of Rep–UvrD
is 99 ± 7 mM, twice that of Rep only but 3.5-fold lower than
that of UvrD alone (Figure 7E and Table 5). In contrast to the helicase only reactions where addition of SSB
lowered the STMP, here the midpoint increased 3-fold to 314 ±
7 mM, similar to that of UvrD in the presence of SSB (292 mM). Finally,
when the salt titration in the presence of fork 3 was done, the midpoint
was 154 ± 4 mM for Rep–UvrD and the addition of SSB lowered
this value to 93 ± 1 mM (Figure 7F). This is virtually identical to what was observed
for Rep only where the STMP decreased from 168 ± 0.5 to 88 ±
6 mM (Table 5). Collectively,
these results show that Rep and UvrD antagonize one another on fork
substrates, that SSB exacerbates this effect, and that on each fork,
a different helicase is the dominant contributor to the antagonistic
effect observed. For forks 1 and 3, it is Rep, and for fork 2, UvrD
is the dominant contributor.

on different days. Data were derived from ATPase assays containing
100 nM DNA substrates, 1 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM MgOAc. In assays where
SSB was present, it was preincubated with DNA prior to initiation
with the Rep–UvrD mixture. UvrD and Rep were mixed together
and incubated on ice for 30 min before being added to initiate the
ATP hydrolysis reaction.

and for forks 2 and 3, 100 nM of SSB was added.

Discussion
The
primary conclusion of this study is that Rep and UvrD antagonize
one another at forks with single-stranded character. This effect is
exacerbated in the presence of SSB in a very complex manner, suggesting
that in addition to ssDNA binding and interactome partner binding,
SSB has an additional role in dictating enzyme activity at stalled
forks. This conclusion has important ramifications for the rescue
of nascent stalled forks as outlined below.

The antagonistic
effect of Rep and UvrD on one another is surprising
for a number of reasons. This follows because these helicases can
form a heterodimer in vitro and, along with DinG, have been shown
to be required for the rescue of forks stalled in highly transcribed
regions in vivo.19,54 The findings herein imply that
a Rep–UvrD heterodimer is not the functional form of these
enzymes at a nascent stalled fork. Support for this idea comes from
the Lohman group who showed that Rep and UvrD cannot substitute for
one another to support unwinding where more than one helicase is bound
to the translocating strand.64 Instead,
Rep and UvrD must function separately, with Rep activity being facilitated
and/or altered by SSB. This result also means that for these helicases
to fulfill their proposed roles in vivo, they must act either sequentially
on the same stalled fork, they must function in different areas of
the fork to facilitate its rescue, or they process different stalled
fork structures. Further support for the separate action of each helicase
comes from studies where the levels of each enzyme were determined
in vivo. These studies found that UvrD is present at 20–96
molecules per cell, Rep at 3, and DnaB at 320 and the concentration
of SSB is 1- to 2000 tetramers per cell.73−76 This represents a ratio of up
to 667 SSB tetramers per Rep helicase and 20 DnaB hexamers for each
Rep monomer. Therefore, it is likely that Rep is bound to either DnaB
or SSB and that free Rep may not be available for binding to UvrD.

If Rep and UvrD function separately, then they are likely to have
different means of accessing a stalled fork. For the Rep helicase,
access is provided by one of two interacting partners: DnaB or SSB.33 Thus, once the fork stalls, and provided DnaB
does as well, this could provide a facile means to gain access to
the fork. As the Rep–SSB ratio in the immediate proximity of
DnaB is likely close to 1, the result suggests that Rep will not be
inhibited but will instead become more catalytically efficient (Table 3C). When bound to
SSB, a fork with a gap in the nascent lagging strand (fork 2; Table 1) will be readily
processed by the Rep helicase. In contrast, if SSB is not immediately
in the vicinity of Rep, then a fork with a gap in the nascent leading
strand will be processed instead as suggested by the kinetic studies
herein (forks 1 and 3; Tables 2B and 3B). As UvrD is not known to
associate with replisome components and it does not bind to SSB, it
must access the fork by other means. First, it can bind directly and
with high affinity to the fork as shown by the Lohman group.70 Second, it may be associated with RNA polymerase,
and following a collision with the replisome, it transfers to the
fork, leading ultimately to its rescue.77 For each mechanism to apply, UvrD should be able to access the DNA
in the presence of other proteins such as SSB. Consistently, we demonstrate
that UvrD is remarkably resistant to SSB (Figures 4 and 5).

The
kinetic analyses herein also reveal insight into the timing
of the activity of each DNA helicase with a stalled fork. The data
show that Rep and UvrD act on nascent stalled forks and not on regressed
forks. This follows because both enzymes show very little activity
on forks with duplex character (Figure 2 and Tables 2 and 3). Instead, the preferred substrates
are forks with a gap in the nascent leading strand (fork 1 or 3).
The preference for these DNA molecules can be explained by the 3′–5′
translocation direction of the helicases, the requirement for a single-strand
tail for loading and, for UvrD, a preference for binding to the single-strand/double-strand
junction.63,70 Collectively, the substrate preferences
determined from characterization of the ATPase activity are consistent
with those determined in helicase assays, even though in this earlier
study, either stoichiometric ratios of enzyme to DNA or an excess
of enzyme relative to DNA was used.63 The
catalytic efficiency of UvrD for fork 4 was high when DNA concentration
was varied. However, this can be attributed to a Hill coefficient
of 1.49 ± 0.08, indicating that in vitro UvrD binds two fork
4 DNA molecules to obtain full activity. This is unlikely to occur
in vivo. Consequently, we propose that Rep and UvrD function on nascent
stalled forks.

The results also provide insight into the roles
of each helicase
at different times during DNA repair. If an advancing fork stalls,
either Rep or UvrD may facilitate its rescue. Under SOS conditions
where elevated concentrations of SSB are present, Rep is completely
inhibited and of the two helicases, only UvrD would be active.78 This follows because the analysis herein shows
that Rep is very sensitive to the presence of SSB, whereas UvrD is
essentially insensitive (Figure 5). This finding is consistent with the ability of this
helicase to displace DNA-bound proteins in its path.19,48,79

Even though our results
support the idea that Rep and UvrD do not
function as a complex or at a minimum cannot work together when present
as a mixture, this does not mean that they cannot partially substitute
for one another. This follows because the two enzymes do have similarities,
but there are also very important differences. It is well-known that
cells can survive mutations or deletions of either uvrD or rep, but deletion of both genes is lethal.80 This is not surprising given that pairwise BLAST
analysis shows that the primary amino acid sequences are 38% identical.81,82 In addition, the crystal structures of the two proteins are similar
and superimpose well with an rmsd of 1.73 Å (data not shown).
In this study, we show that the preferred fork substrates for both
enzymes are forks that contain a gap in the nascent leading strand.
This preference can be attributed to the polarity of translocation
for each enzyme which is 3′–5′. This is where
the similarities end.

First, while both helicases displace lac
repressor, only UvrD can
disassemble RecA filaments.44,48,79 Second, UvrD possesses a 75-residue C-terminal tail that extends
from the structure, which is required for interacting with UvrB, and
this tail is not present in Rep.28,56,83 Third, the Rep–SSB complex can be purified,
and stoichiometric amounts of SSB relative to Rep have profound effects
on the catalytic behavior of the helicase. This effect was not observed
for UvrD. Thus, Rep and UvrD are more different than previously thought.

In summary, the results presented herein are consistent with the
roles of Rep and UvrD in the rescue of stalled replication forks.19,46 However, they cannot act simultaneously but must work separately
(Figure 8). The data
from the Lohman group and those presented herein show that UvrD forms
a very stable interaction with fork DNA, indicating that once loaded,
it will be very difficult to dislodge by a competitor such as SSB.
The substrate specificity for each enzyme indicates that Rep, like
UvrD, acts at a fork prior to the regression step. This follows because
of the high catalytic efficiency observed in the presence of DNA substrates
that mimic a nascent stalled fork and because of the correspondingly
low levels of ATPase activity in the presence of substrates that mimic
regressed forks. Our findings are consistent with previous studies
focusing on the helicase activities of Rep or UvrD.63,68 Consistent with our previous work, SSB plays a very important role
in fork rescue.11,13,15,52,84 It has very
little effect on UvrD while altering the substrate specificity of
Rep when present at stoichiometric ratios and totally inhibiting this
helicase when present in excess. Intriguingly, the Deinococcus radiodurans SSB modulates the balance
between helicase and translocase activity of D. radiodurans UvrD.85 Here, SSB favors helicase over
translocase activity. Future studies will determine whether E. coli SSB modulates E. coli UvrD and Rep function in a similar manner. The limited analysis
of the Rep–SSB complex that we have done suggests that this
may be occurring.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP),
nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NADH), pyruvate kinase (PK), and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company. ATP, the 16/10 Heparin
FF column, and His Trap FF crude 5 mL column were from GE Healthcare
Biosciences. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was from Acros Organics. Bovine
serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from New England Biolabs. The TSKgel
DNA-STAT column was from Tosoh Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA).

Reagents
All solutions were prepared using ELGA Nanopure
water. Stock solutions of PEP were prepared in 0.5 M Tris-acetate
(pH 7.5). ATP was dissolved as a concentrated stock in 0.5 M Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0), with the concentration determined spectrophotometrically
using an extinction coefficient of 1.54 × 104 M–1 cm–1. PEP and ATP were stored in
aliquots at −20 °C. NADH was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-acetate
(pH 8.0), with the concentration determined using an extinction coefficient
of 6.22 × 10–3 M–1 cm–1, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C.
DTT was dissolved as a 1 M stock in nanopure water and stored at −20
°C. Stock ATPase reaction buffers (10× concentration) were
prepared in 200 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), with 10 mM DTT and 0.1 mg/mL
BSA, and stored in 500 μL aliquots at −80 °C.

Plasmids overexpressing E. coli UvrD
and separately, his-Rep, were provided by Dr. T. Lohman (Washington
University, St. Louis). The uvrD gene was amplified
by PCR and cloned by Infusion cloning into pET28a+ to generate his-uvrD. The resulting clone was checked by restriction
enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing.

DNA Cofactors
M13 mp18 ssDNA was prepared
as described.53 The concentration of ssDNA
was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient
of 8780 M–1 cm–1 (nucleotides).
Purified DNA was stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Linearized dsDNA was produced by subjecting a 12 kB pBluescript construct
(details to be published elsewhere) to cleavage by SpeI and heat inactivating
the enzyme at 80 °C for 20 min. The concentration of linearized
dsDNA was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient
of 6500 M–1 cm–1 (nucleotides).

Oligonucleotides used to construct model fork
substrates were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT; Coralville,
IA). The sequences were adapted from those used previously52,53 and contain a mobile homologous core flanked by heterologous sequences.
Oligonucleotides 170–173 were purified using a DNA-STAT column,
with 170 eluted at 800 mM salt; 171 eluted at 540 mM salt; 172 eluted
at 612 mM salt; and 173 eluted at 840 mM salt. Oligonucleotides 422–425
were purified using urea-PAGE, followed by gel filtration using NAP-25
columns (GE Healthcare Biosciences) and ethanol precipitation. The
concentration of each oligonucleotide was determined spectrophotometrically
using the extinction coefficient provided by IDT.

Model fork
substrates were prepared by annealing eight oligonucleotides
in various combinations: PB170 (5′-CTAGAGACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGGATCTGATGCTGTCTAGAGGCCTCCACTATGAAATCGCTGCA-3′),
PB171 (5′-GCGATTTCATAGTGGAGGCCTCTAGACAGCA-3′), PB172
(5′-TGCTGTCTAGAGACTATCGATCTATGAGCTCTGCAGC-3′), PB173
(5′-CCGGGCTGCAGAGCTCATAGATCGATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATCAGATCCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGTCT-3′),
PB422 (5′-GTACCATGCTCGAGATTACGAGATATCGATGCATGCG), PB423 (5′-AATTCGCATGCATCGATATAATACGTGAGGCCTAGGATCGA-3′).
PB 424 (5′-TCGATC CTAGGCCTCACGTATTATATCGATGCATGCG-3′).
PB425 (5′-AATTCGCATGCATCGATATCTCGTAATCTCGAGCATGGTAC-3′).
Purified oligonucleotides (1–10 μM molecules each in
different annealing experiments) were annealed in a total volume of
100 μL containing 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgOAc. Annealing involved
incubation of the DNA–buffer mixture in thin-walled PCR tubes
at 100 °C for 5 min, followed by an overnight cooling step to
room temperature. Fork 4 and HJ were purified using a TOSOH column
after annealing. Glycogen was used to improve precipitation. The extent
of annealing was verified by nondenaturing PAGE using 5′-end
labeled oligonucleotides annealed under identical conditions (data
not shown). Typically, >95% of the DNA present was found to be
in
the annealed substrate (data not shown). Fork 1 was formed by annealing
PB170 and 173; fork 2 by PB170, 171, and 173; fork 3 by PB170, 172,
and 173; fork 4 by PB170, 171, 172, and 173, and finally, the HJ contained
oligonucleotides PB422, 423, 424, and 425 (Table 1).

Proteins
His-Rep Helicase
BL21 cells (10 L) overexpressing N-terminal
his-Rep were grown at 37 °C in a fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific
Co. Inc.; Edison, NJ) and induced with 100 μM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) at optical density (OD)600 of 0.79. The culture
was then grown for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested at an OD600 of 3.9 by centrifugation and resuspended into lysis buffer
[50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose] using 2.05 mL/g of cells. The
cells were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80
°C.

Frozen BL21 cells were thawed overnight at 4 °C
with gentle stirring. The next day, lysozyme was added to a final
concentration of 1 mg/mL, together with 5 μL of benzonase. The
suspension was then stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. Deoxycholate
and Triton were added together to a final concentration of 0.5 and
0.1%, respectively, followed by stirring at 4 °C for 40 min.
Next, the [NaCl] was increased to 600 mM, and imidazole was added
to a final concentration of 30 mM. The solution was stirred for 30
min and then subjected to centrifugation at 48 297g. The supernatant which contained His-Rep (cleared cell lysate) was
then loaded onto a 5 mL nickel column and washed with 125 column volumes
(CV) of binding buffer (30 mM imidazole, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 600
mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The column was then washed with 100 CV of binding
buffer +0.2% NP40, followed by another binding buffer wash only, until
the baseline was reached. Proteins were eluted using a 100 mL linear
gradient (30–500 mM imidazole), whereas Rep was eluted between
129 and 406 mM imidazole. The fractions containing Rep were pooled
and dialyzed overnight against buffer A + 200 mM NaCl [20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM DTT, and
20% glycerol]. After dialysis, the protein solution was subjected
to centrifugation for 10 min at 10 000g and
loaded onto a 20 mL ssDNA cellulose column equilibrated with buffer
A + 500 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted using an 80 mL linear NaCl
gradient (0.5–1.5 M), and Rep was eluted between 0.8 and 1.1
M NaCl. Fractions that contained Rep were pooled and precipitated
by 50% (NH4)2SO4, which was added
slowly while stirring at 4 °C.

The next day, the protein
suspension was subjected to centrifugation
at 48 297g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended
in buffer A + 100 mM NaCl, and the supernatant was loaded to an 8
mL mono Q column equilibrated with buffer A + 100 mM NaCl. Following
a wash step with loading buffer, the protein was eluted using a linear
gradient (100 mM to 1 M NaCl). His-Rep was eluted between 262 and
343 mM NaCl. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against storage buffer
overnight [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl,
50% glycerol] and stored in −80 °C and labeled as Pool
I. A significant amount of protein was observed in the flow through
and 2 M NaCl wash of the mono Q column. These fractions were combined
and precipitated by adding 70% AmSO4 with stirring overnight
at 4 °C. The protein precipitate was subjected to centrifugation
at 48 297g and resuspended in buffer B + 100
mM NaCl [20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA]. The protein was
then loaded onto a 20 mL column (HiPrep 16/10 SP FF, GE Healthcare
Life Sciences; Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated with buffer B + 50 mM
NaCl. The protein was eluted using a 288 mL linear NaCl gradient (50
mM to 1 M), and his-Rep was eluted between 460 and 510 mM NaCl. The
fractions that contained his-Rep were dialyzed overnight against storage
buffer, separated into small aliquots and stored in −80 °C,
and labeled as Pool II. For all chromatography, the presence of his-Rep
was determined by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of his-Rep was calculated
using ε = 76 780 M–1 cm–1 as determined from the amino acid sequence. All assays were done
with Pool I.

His-Rep + SSB complex was purified
as follows. Tuner cells expressing His-Rep were transformed with a
plasmid expressing wild-type SSB. A 10 L culture was grown at 37 °C
to an OD600 of 0.4, and protein was induced with 500 μM
IPTG, followed by growth for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation and resuspended into lysis buffer using a concentration
of 2.05 mL/g. The cell lysis steps were identical to those of Rep,
except 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added immediately
after adding benzonase. Following centrifugation to clarify the cell
lysate, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5 mL nickel column. The
column was then washed with 138 CV of binding buffer, followed by
25 CV of binding buffer + NP40 and then binding buffer only until
the baseline was reached. The proteins were eluted using a 100 mL
linear gradient from 30 to 500 mM imidazole, with his-Rep + SSB eluting
between 129 and 453 mM. On the same day, the fractions containing
proteins were pooled and diluted sixfold with buffer A [20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol] before being loaded
onto a Q-sepharose column, equilibrated with buffer A + 100 mM NaCl.
Proteins were eluted using a 576 mL linear gradient (100 mM to 1 M
NaCl), and the protein complex was eluted between 460 and 650 mM NaCl.
Fractions containing the his-Rep + SSB complex were pooled and precipitated
by adding (NH4)2SO4 to 50% with stirring
overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate was subjected to centrifugation
at 48 297g for 1 h and resuspended in buffer
A + 100 mM NaCl.

Proteins were then loaded onto a 20 mL ssDNA
cellulose column,
equilibrated in the same buffer. Following loading and washing, a
100 mL linear gradient (100 mM to 1 M NaCl) was applied, but no protein
was eluted. The column was then sequentially washed with 10 mL each
of 1 M NaCl and 1.5 M NaCl. As no protein was eluted, 40 mL of 2 M
NaCl was applied, and finally, the protein complex was eluted. The
his-Rep + SSB complex was then dialyzed against storage buffer (same
as his-Rep). SDS-PAGE was used to determine the presence of the his-Rep
+ SSB complex in each chromatographic step. The concentration of his-Rep
+ SSB complex was determined spectrophotometrically using a total
extinction coefficient of Rep and SSB: 188 620 M–1 cm–1, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry (Rep–SSB
tetramer) as judged by SDS-PAGE.86

Large-scale growth (10 L) of the N-terminal his-UvrD protein was performed in a Microgen fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific
Co. Inc). Tuner cells (10 L) overexpressing his-UvrD were grown at
37 °C and induced with 500 μM IPTG at an OD600 of 0.76. The cell culture was then grown for additional 3 h and
harvested by centrifugation at an OD600 of 3.6. The cells
were then resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20%
sucrose] and stored at −80 °C.

Frozen cells (76.20
g) from the 10 L culture were thawed overnight
at 4 °C with gentle stirring in the following buffer: 250 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25% sucrose, and 0.1 mM PMSF. Lysozyme was added
to 1 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), followed by 10 μL of
benzonase per liter of cells. All steps described below were done
at 4 °C. In addition, PMSF was added to a final concentration
of 0.1 mM, along with 3 tablets of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Pierce),
followed by stirring for 15 min. Then, deoxycholate was added dropwise
to the 0.3% final concentration, and the mixture was stirred for 10
min. At this point, NaCl was added slowly to a final concentration
of 0.48 M and stirred for 15 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation
at 48 000g for 30 min.

The supernatant
was transferred to a fresh cold beaker, and Polymin
P was added slowly to the 0.3% final concentration while stirring.
Once addition was complete, the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The
mixture was then subjected to centrifugation at 6340g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean cold beaker,
and solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the 30% final concentration
while stirring, followed by continuous stirring overnight. Proteins
were then collected by centrifugation at 48 000g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a 100 mL nickel
column binding buffer (15.48 mM Na2HPO4, 4.5
mM NaH2PO4, 600 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, pH
7.4) using a dounce homogenizer, followed by the addition of another
100 mL binding buffer to make it less milky. The aggregated proteins
were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10 000g. The resulting supernatant was then loaded onto a 5 mL
nickel column equilibrated in binding buffer.

Once loading was
complete, the column was washed with a 250 mL
binding buffer until baseline, followed by 250 mL binding buffer +
NP40 (0.2% final concentration), and again washed with binding buffer
only until the baseline was reached. His-UvrD was eluted using a 100
mL linear gradient (30–500 mM imidazole), with UvrD eluting
at 237 mM imidazole. The fractions containing UvrD were pooled and
precipitated by 70% (NH4)2SO4 while
stirring very slowly overnight. The protein was recovered by centrifugation
for 30 min at 48 000g. The pellet was resuspended
in 20 mL of buffer A [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mM
DTT] containing 300 mM NaCl, which was necessary to keep the protein
soluble.

Next, the resuspended protein solution was loaded onto
a 20 mL
heparin column equilibrated in buffer A + 100 mM NaCl. During loading,
the protein solution was diluted with buffer A (no salt) so that the
final [NaCl] was 100 mM. The protein was eluted using a 200 mL linear
NaCl gradient (100–1000 mM), with UvrD eluting at 415 mM NaCl.
The eluted protein was >95% homogeneous at this point, so fractions
that contained UvrD were pooled and dialyzed overnight against storage
buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1 M NaCl,
and 50% glycerol]. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically
using an extinction coefficient of 1.06 × 105 M–1 cm–1.86 His-UvrD was stored in small aliquots at −80 °C.

The final pool of UvrD protein contained no contaminating bands
as determined by the staining of SDS-PAGE gels with Coomassie. Further,
no contaminating ssDNA or dsDNA nucleases were detected using radioactive
nuclease assays (data not shown).

E. coliSSB was
purified from strain K12ΔH1Δtrp, as described.87 The concentration of purified SSB was determined
at 280 nM using ε = 30 000 M–1 cm–1. The site size of SSB was determined to be 10 nucleotides
per monomer by monitoring the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence
of SSB that occurs on binding to ssDNA, as described.88 Histidine-tagged SSBΔC8 was purified as described
previously.89 The site size was determined
to be 10 nucleotides per monomer.

Bacteriophage gene
32 protein (gp32) was purified
as described previously.52 The concentration
of purified gp32 was determined at 280 nM using ε = 37 000
M–1 cm–1. The site size was calculated
to be 7 nucleotides per monomer by monitoring the quenching of the
intrinsic fluorescence of gp32 that occurs on binding to ssDNA, as
described.

ATP Hydrolysis Assay
The hydrolysis
of ATP was monitored
using a coupled spectrophotometric assay carried out at 37 °C
as described previously.52,53 The conversion of ATP
to ADP and Pi is linked to the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ and monitored as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Assays
were performed at 37 °C and monitored using a Varian, Cary-50
Bio UV–visible spectrophotometer. The standard reaction buffer
for UvrD contained 20 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 0.3 mM NADH,
7.5 mM PEP, 20 U/mL PK, 20 U/mL LDH, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgOAc, DNA (either
single-stranded or double-stranded), and 10 nM UvrD. The standard
reaction buffer for Rep contained 20 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mM
DTT, 0.3 mM NADH, 7.5 mM PEP, 20 U/mL PK, 20 U/mL LDH, 1 mM ATP, 10
μM nts of M13 ssDNA or 100 nM fork substrate, and 10 nM Rep,
UvrD, or the Rep–SSB complex.

Assays were performed in
a reaction volume of 150 μL and were initiated by the addition
of enzyme following a 2 min preincubation at 37 °C of all other
components. When SSB was present, it was added prior to the enzyme
except when doing SSB titrations. The concentration of M13 ssDNA and
dsDNA used in assays was 10 μM nucleotides; the concentration
of fork substrates was 100 nM molecules. The rate of ATP hydrolysis
was calculated as described previously.53 In a typical reaction, close to 200 data points from the early part
of time courses (i.e., within the first 10 min) were used to draw
a linear fit to the data to calculate reaction rates. To obtain kinetic
parameters, data were analyzed using nonlinear curve fitting in Prism
v 5.04 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). DNA and ATP titration data were
fit to either the Hill equation (V = (Vmax·[DNA]n)/([S0.5]n + [DNA]n) or the Michaelis–Menten equation
(V = (Vmax·[DNA])/(Km + [DNA]).90

In salt-titration experiments, the same UvrD reaction buffers were
used (see above). Once a steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis was achieved,
NaCl was added in 33.33 mM increments (1 μL volumes). This was
repeated until all ATP hydrolysis ceased. The resulting hydrolysis
rate in each steady-state region was calculated and expressed as a
percent of the steady-state rate in the absence of NaCl. The total
volume used to calculate the final concentration of NaCl was adjusted
after each addition in order to correct for the additions themselves.
A line of best fit was drawn for data points between each addition
to obtain the ATP hydrolysis rate after each salt increment. These
rates were subsequently graphed to determine the concentration of
NaCl, resulting in a 50% reduction in the rate of ATP hydrolysis which
corresponds to the STMP.

For forks 1–3, M13, and dsDNA,
protein titration (SSB/SSBΔC8/GP32)
experiments were carried out similar to that of the salt titration.
SSB and SSBΔC8 were added as tetramers, and their concentrations
added to fork 1 were 200 nM and to forks 2 and 3 100 nM. For gp32,
the concentrations were used but in monomer of protein. Reactions
were initiated by the addition of UvrD, and once a steady state was
observed, proteins were added either in 200 nM increments (for fork
1) or in 100 nM increments (for forks 2 and 3) (∼1 μL
volumes). The rate after each protein increment was determined and
expressed as a fraction of the reaction rate for UvrD only.

Determination
of the Stoichiometry of SSB Binding to Fork Structures
This
was done as described previously.15 The
binding of SSB to fork substrates containing ssDNA tails was
determined by monitoring the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence
of SSB that occurs on binding to ssDNA, as described.88 In these assays, SSB was titrated with increasing amounts
of annealed substrate until the maximum amount of intrinsic fluorescence
was quenched. This corresponded to two SSB tetramers bound to fork
1 (two ssDNA tails) and one tetramer each to forks 2 and 3 (one single
ssDNA tail each; data not shown).

Analysis of Coomassie Stained
Gels
Photographs of stained
SDS-PAGE gels were analyzed using the Gels Analysis function in Fiji.91 Here, the area under each peak was determined
from the densitometric trace of each lane. This value was then divided
by the molecular weight of each protein to correct for the different
amounts of Coomassie dye being present in bands, assuming each protein
stained equally well with Coomassie. The ratio of his-Rep–SSB
was then determined.
