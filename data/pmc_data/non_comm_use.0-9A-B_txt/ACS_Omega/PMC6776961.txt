Graphene
quantum dots (GQDs) have attracted much attention of many
researchers because of their low cytotoxicity, good optical stability,
and excellent photoluminescence property, which make them novel nanostructured
materials in many application fields ranging from energy to biomedicine
and the environment. In this work, highly fluorescent nitrogen-doped
graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) were synthesized through microwave
heating using sodium citrate and triethanolamine as raw materials.
The as-prepared N-GQDs showed considerable bright blue fluorescence
with a quantum yield of 8% and excellent uniform dispersion with an
average diameter of approximately 5.6 nm; they also exhibited excellent
stability and pH-sensitive properties. Furthermore, we demonstrated
the application of N-GQDs as probes for metal ion detection. The results
indicated that N-GQDs responded rapidly toward Fe3+ because
of the static quenching mechanism. A detection method was proposed,
with detection linear in two ranges from 20 to 70 nM (F = −0.9666 CFe3+ (nM) + 608.85 (R = 0.9740)) and from 1 to
100 μM (F = −12.04 CFe3+ (μM) + 1191.94 (R = 0.9541)); the lowest detection limit of 9.7 nM for Fe3+ was obtained. The results obtained in this work lay the
foundation for the development of high-performance and robust metal
ion detection sensors. Moreover, it can also possibly be used as a
new type of fluorescent ink.

1 Introduction
Graphene
quantum dots (GQDs), as a member of the graphene family,
also exhibit a sequence of new properties due to the boundary effect
and the quantum constraint effect in addition to their excellent properties.1 Therefore, they have attracted widespread attention
from scientists working in the fields of materials, chemistry, physics,
and biology.2 GQDs are very small fragments
of graphene and represent single to dozens of graphene sheets with
diameters less than 20 nm.1,3 Compared with conventional
fluorescent organic dyes, colloidal quantum dots, and fluorescent
proteins, GQDs have an attractive property; they are a kind of carbon
raw material and also show more unique physical and chemical properties
such as high optical stability, low toxicity, good biocompatibility,
good thermal and electrical conductivity, adjustable photoluminescence,
and solubility in various solvents.1,4 Moreover, functionalized
or modified graphene quantum dots can alter the photoluminescence
properties and improve their quality,5 for
example, the introduction of special functional groups on the surface
of quantum dots can enhance the specificity of their reaction.6 With the emergence of modified or functionalized
nanocomposites, they have become novel nanostructured materials, which
have a comprehensive range of applications in energy, biomedical,
and environmental fields.4

To date,
a variety of top-down and bottom-up approaches are being
studied to develop a convenient preparation method of GQDs, such as
hydrotherma,7−10 solvothermal,11−14 ultrasonic shearing,15 and microwave.16,17 The former method usually requires multiple steps and lacks control
over the product shape and size distribution; also, nonhomogeneous
morphology, low quantum yields, and low production yields of GQDs
limit the mass production. The latter method, in most cases, refers
to the preparation of quantum dots for polycyclic aromatic compounds
such as C60 and C70. Indeed, microwave synthetic
methods are versatile and can offer several advantages when used.
With their homogeneous heating and a quite short reaction time, the
microwave method is widely used in the synthesis.

At present,
there are many ways to detect ions;18−20 for example,
flame atomic absorption spectrometry, with high speed and high accuracy,
can meet the requirements of trace element detection of the classic
method. But the detection of metal ions by a fluorescent probe has
many advantages such as low equipment demand, easy operation, quick
analysis, and high sensitivity. To date, quantum dots (QDs), as fluorescent
probes, have been widely used both in analysis and in detection.3 Due to different modification effects, QDs show
different fluorescence properties; different metal ions can be detected
by QDs with different fluorescent properties. As a result, specific
physical and chemical reactions occur between the detected object
and the functionalized QDs, during which the composition of groups
and charges on the surface structure of QDs are altered, resulting
in subsequent luminescence intensity either increasing or being extinguished.21

This article aimed to solve the problem
of synthesis of a weak
fluorescent GQDs by a microwave one-pot synthesis. A particularly
weak fluorescent GQDs were prepared according to the reported work
by the Zhuang group.2

In this work,
we prepared nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots
(N-GQDs) using sodium citrate and triethanolamine (TEOA) as raw materials,
which present highly blue fluorescence with an average diameter of
approximately 5.6 nm and excellent environmental stability and pH-sensitive
properties. The N-GQDs were prepared by a domestic microwave one-step
synthesis. No other harsh chemicals (strong acids and organic solvents)
were used during the experiment. The method of synthesis is shown
in Scheme 1. Compared
to the traditional method route, this synthesis method is faster,
simpler, and more efficient, and it is easy to obtain the raw materials,
easy to operate, and no solvent and catalyst are required. The obtained
N-GQDs can be applied to detect Fe3+ as a fluorescent probe
due to their high selectivity and high sensitivity toward Fe3+. After adding Fe3+, the experimental results show that
the decrease in the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional
to the increase in the Fe3+ concentration and that the
lowest detection limit (LOD) of 9.7 nM for Fe3+ is obtained.
The process of detection is shown in Scheme S1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent N-GQDs
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization of Synthesis
Conditions of N-GQDs
and Characterization of N-GQDs
Among the experiments conducted,
the optimization experiment was carried out first. We investigated
the effects of the dosage ratio, microwave temperature, and microwave
heating time on the fluorescence intensity of highly fluorescent N-GQDs. Figure S1 shows the effect of different dosage
ratios on the fluorescence intensity (1:5, 1:11, 1:20, 1:30, and 1:50).
The fluorescence intensity of the product is greatly affected by the
dosage ratio, and the result indicated that the fluorescence intensity
is optimal when the ratio of sodium citrate to triethanolamine is
1:11. Next, different microwave times (1, 2, 3, 4 min) were measured;
the effect of fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs with the microwave
time is shown in Figure S2. According to
the previous literature, the microwave heating time should be strictly
controlled; especially additional heating time should be avoided strictly
because overheating may lead to the formation of large nonfluorescent
GQDs or graphene oxide.22 The fluorescence
intensity was the largest when the time was 2 min. As shown in Figure S3, different microwave temperatures (low,
thaw, mid-low, middle, mid-high) were further investigated under the
optimal dosage ratio and microwave heating time conditions. The fluorescence
intensity is maximum at the middle and low fire. Therefore, we chose
the middle and low fire as the optimal heating temperature of the
N-GQDs in our subsequent experiments.

According to the previous
optimization experiments, we synthesized N-GQDs with a dosage ratio
of sodium citrate to triethanolamine of 1:11 at the middle and low
fire in 2 min. The fluorescence spectra of the resultant N-GQDs are
shown in Figure 1a.
The emission peak of N-GQDs is 442 nm and the excitation peak is 340
nm; the bright blue fluorescence was observed when the N-GQDs were
exposed to ultraviolet light at 365 nm (Figure 1a). Moreover, the fluorescent properties
of the two raw materials through the same reaction process were also
compared and are shown in Figure S4. The
fluorescence spectra of GQDs with a peak of excitation at 306 nm (black
line) and a peak of emission at 404 nm (green line), and TEOA with
a peak of excitation at 336 nm (blue line) and a peak of emission
at 419 nm (yellow line), and N-GQDs with a peak of excitation at 340
nm (red line) and a peak of emission at 442 nm (pink line) were clearly
observed; the fluorescence intensity of the synthesized N-GQDs is
22 times higher than that of the GQDs prepared. Besides, to verify
that the GQDs are not doped with a nitrogen element, a simple full
survey spectrum through XPS is performed as shown in Figure S5. To survey the surface morphology and estimate the
average diameter of the as-prepared N-GQDs, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out and the results are shown
in Figures 1b and S6. The N-GQDs are uniformly dispersed in an
aqueous solution without obvious sediment, and the average diameter
was approximately 5.6 nm within the particle size distribution range
of 2.4–9.6 nm. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement
is a powerful tool for the characterization of the thickness of N-GQDs
(less than 2 nm), normally thinner than that of carbon dots. The AFM
image revealed that the typical topographic heights are mainly in
the range of 1.10–1.83 nm, with an average height of 1.58 nm
as shown in Figures 1c,d and S7, which suggests that most of
the N-GQDs have one to three graphene layers.23 Further, the quantum yield was calculated using a quinine–sulfate
solution as the reference; the quantum yields of GQDs and N-GQDs were
calculated and are shown in Table S1. The
results confirmed that the N-GQDs with an 8% quantum yield have a
higher fluorescence quantum yield as compared to GQDs.

N-GQDs. (c) AFM image of N-GQDs on a maria substrate. Inset: the height

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were
evaluated to determine
the surface chemistry of the as-prepared N-GQDs. As shown in Figure S8, the FT-IR spectra of N-GQDs exhibited
the characteristic peak at 3356 cm–1, showing stretching
vibration for the O–H bond. The stretching vibration peaks
at 2954, 2887, and 2831 cm–1 are the C–H
bond stretching vibration and 1589 cm–1 is the stretching
vibration peak of the C=O bond. The stretching vibration peaks
at 1404 and 1076 cm–1 were assigned to the C–N
bond and the C–O bond, respectively.

The elemental composition
and surface groups of N-GQDs were also
analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 2 shows the full-range spectrum
of XPS and high-resolution O 1s, C 1s, and N 1s spectra of the resultant
N-GQDs. Three major peaks at 284.6, 401.2, and 532.3 eV were observed
in the full-range spectrum, which corresponded to C 1s, N 1s, and
O 1s, respectively. This indicated that N-GQDs were mainly composed
of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and N atoms have been successfully
doped into the framework of N-CQDs. A high-resolution C1s spectrum
can be deconvoluted into three typical peaks at 284.7 eV (C–C/C=C),
286.5 eV (C–O/C–N), and 288.6 eV (C=O/C=N).
The N 1s spectrum can be broken down into two peaks at 400.2 and 402.9
eV, revealing the presence of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N, respectively.
This result indicated that the doped nitrogen existed in the form
of the above two chemical states. Moreover, the XPS analysis is in
accord with the FT-IR result. Finally, the peaks of the high-resolution
spectrum of the O 1s could be fitted into characteristic three peaks
at 531.5, 532, and 533.4 eV, respectively, representing C=O
and C–O groups. Table S2 indicated
that oxygen may be the main doped element that makes an important
contribution to the change in the fluorescence property, and nitrogen
also plays a certain role but the effect is not very obvious, which
is consistent with previous reports.24,25

survey spectrum and (b) high-resolution C 1s,

2.2 Optical Properties of N-GQDs
As shown
in the UV–vis spectrum (Figure 3a), one characteristic absorption band in the ultraviolet
region was observed. The absorption peak of N-GQDs in the ultraviolet region is about 263 nm, corresponding
to the GQDs of π–π* energy-level transition. The
intensity of the light absorption peak first increases and then decreases
with an increase in the dilution ratio with a slight redshift, which
is likely caused due to surface/edge defects in the N-GQDs. In addition,
compared with other semiconductor QDs, GQDs have a unique characteristic
of larger fluorescence bandwidth; its fluorescence bandwidth decreases
with an increase in the excitation wavelength and redshift occurs. Figure 3b shows the emission
spectra of the resultant N-GQDs with increasing excitation wavelength
ranging from 280 to 520 nm. The resultant N-GQDs display the highest
emission intensity when excited at 340 nm. The emission bands show
the redshift phenomenon with increasing excitation wavelength, as
shown in the normalized fluorescence emission spectra (Figure 3b).

(b) Fluorescence (FL) emission spectra of highly fluorescent N-GQDs
excited by various wavelengths ranging from 280 to 520 nm (inset:
the normalized FL emission spectra). (c) The photobleaching performance
of the N-GQD solution under continuous illumination with a 365 nm
UV lamp for 1 h.

The fluorescence stability
of the resultant N-GQDs was also studied.
The photobleaching performance was evaluated (Figures 3c and S9). The
as-prepared N-GQDs show insignificant photobleaching under continuous
illumination with the 365 nm UV lamp for 1 h and fluorescent time
scan for 2 h under 360 nm excitation. The results showed that the
fluorescence intensity remained stable and strong during continuous
illumination or scanning. The pH values of the solution increasing
from 2 to 12 were tested. At pH ranging from 2 to 5, the fluorescence
intensity of the as-prepared N-GQDs increased with increasing pH values;
however, the fluorescence intensity of the N-GQDs decreased with increasing
pH between 7 and 12 (Figure S10). The fluorescent
intensity is the highest when the pH value is 5; this result indicated
that the fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs was closely related to the
pH. Therefore, the subsequent detection of ions is completed in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)-buffered solution (pH 5). In addition, the fluorescence
intensity of N-GQDs in different concentrations of NaCl solutions
did not change significantly within 1 M (Figure S11), which indicated that the N-GQDs remain stable under conditions
of high ionic strength and this result confirmed their viability in
complex environments.

2.3 Fluorescence Sensing of
Fe3+
The fluorescence reaction-quenching effects
of the N-GQDs were
investigated to test the selectivity and sensing after adding to different
metal ions including Co2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Bi2+, Na+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Pb2+, and Cr3+, respectively. Figure 4a,b shows that Fe2+ and Fe3+ can trigger the fluorescence reaction
quenching of N-GQDs. Ferrum exists universally in two kinds of stable
states in nature, namely Fe2+ and Fe3+, which
can sometimes transform into each other. It was reported that ferrum
in nature mainly exists in the form of Fe3+, and Fe3+ is an important ion in the biological system; it can be
an indicator of conditions such as mental decline, heart failure,
diabetes, and anemia.26 Therefore, the
determination of Fe3+ is very important in sensing and
environmental fields.

N-GQDs in
the presence of various common metal ions. (c) Fluorescence spectra
of the highly fluorescent N-GQDs upon the addition of Fe3+ increasing from 0 to 0.1 mM. (d) Linear relationship between Fe3+ concentrations and the fluorescence intensity.

As shown in Figure 4c, the fluorescence intensity of the N-GQD solution significantly
decreased with increasing Fe3+ concentration from 0 to
0.1mM, which suggested that there is a certain correlation between
the fluorescence intensity and the ion concentration. As shown in Figure 4d, two good linear
relationships between quenching efficiency were observed over the
ranges of 1–100 μM and 20–70 nm, and a detection
method was used with two detection linear ranges from 20 to 70 nm
(F = −0.9666 CFe3+ (nM) + 608.85 (R = 0.9740))
and from 1 to 100 μM (F = −12.04 CFe3+ (μM) + 1191.94
(R = 0.9541)). The lowest detection limit (LOD) of
9.7 nM was obtained for Fe3+ (LOD = 3Sa/b, where Sa represents the lowest signal standard deviation and b represents the slope of the linear calibration plot).27 The above experimental results clearly prove
that N-GQDs can be applied as highly effective nanotechnology for
the detection of Fe3+.

To investigate the mechanisms
for interaction between N-GQDs and
the detected ion, a Stern–Volmer plot was constructed to understand
the quenching process of the system. Generally, the fluorescence-quenching
process is caused by the interaction between fluorescence molecules
and quenching molecules, which usually includes dynamic quenching
or static quenching. The Stern–Volmer equation is given by  where F and F0 are the fluorescence
intensities of N-GQDs in the presence
and absence of the Fe3+ solution at an excitation of 340
nm, respectively, [Q] is the concentration of the quencher, and ksv represents the quenching constant.

The Stern–Volmer plot showed a good linear trend of the
Fe3+ concentration in both the ranges 1–100 μM
and 20–70 nm (Figure S12). The quenching
constant (ksv) in the standard Stern–Volmer
equation is a method to measure the binding affinity between fluorescence
molecules and quenching molecules, and was equal to 1.2 × 104 M–1 (μM grade) by the above equation.
Therefore, we speculate that the static quenching may be caused by
the combination of ground-state fluorescence molecules and quenching
molecules to form nonfluorescent complexes. Meanwhile, the fluorescence
lifetimes of N-GQDs and the N-GQDs/Fe3+ complex were determined
as shown in Figure 5. The fluorescence lifetime of N-GQDs is 2.80 ns, which has three
components: 0.50 ns (ca. 40.47%), 2.30 ns (ca. 39.75%), and 8.56 ns
(ca. 19.78%) under excitation of 360 nm in solution. In the presence
of Fe3+, the fluorescence lifetime of N-GQDs/Fe3+ is 1.90 ns, which also contains two components, 0.56 ns (ca. 48.86%)
and 3.18 ns (ca. 51.14%), under the same condition. The average decay
times of N-GQDs and N-GQDs/Fe3+ are very similar, which
further confirms the formation of the nonfluorescent complexes due
to static quenching. A TEM image of the N-GQDs/Fe3+ complex
was also obtained (Figure S13) and the
size shows little change when compared with that of the N-GQDs. Furthermore,
evident changes were observed in the FT-IR spectra of N-GQDs without
and with the addition of Fe3+ (Figure S8); this demonstrated that the chemical behavior of surface
functionalities of N-GQDs changes due to strong affinity with Fe3+, and changes in the XPS spectra of N-GQDs with and without
Fe3+ in Figure S14 indicated
that the fluorescence quenching might be ascribed to the coordination
of Fe3+ with −C–N–C of N-GQDs from
the nonfluorescent complex.

Figure 5 Fluorescence decays of N-GQDs and the N-GQDs/Fe3+ complex.

Finally, valid practical
applications of N-GQDs were performed
in sensing of Fe3+ in real samples such as tap water or
natural mineral water and used as fluorescent ink. The recovery rate
of Fe3+ in natural mineral water was about 107–129%
and the recovery rate of Fe3+ in tap water was about 89–101%
as shown in Table S3. Fluorescent patterns
and characteristics on the filter paper under 365 nm UV lamp irradiation,
as shown in Figure 6, indicated that it can possibly be used as a new type of fluorescent
ink.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we developed a
highly efficient one-step synthesis
method for highly fluorescent N-GQDs from the carbonization of sodium
citrate and triethanolamine using a microwave; the as-prepared N-GQDs
showed a bright blue luminescence with an 8% quantum yield and exhibited
excellent properties such as high fluorescence intensity, excellent
stability, and water solubility. The N-GQDs were successfully applied
to act as a fluorescent probe for the detection of Fe3+ concentration with high selectivity and sensitivity due to a static
quenching mechanism. The N-GQDs prepared showed good stability and
a low detection limit, and it can possibly be used as a new type of
fluorescent ink.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
Sodium citrate
(Na3C6H5O7·2H2O) was purchased from China National Pharmaceutical Group
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Shanghai. Triethanolamine (TEOA, C6H15NO3) was purchased from Inner Mongolia
Renjiu Trade Co., Ltd. All reagents and chemicals used in this work
were of analytical grade and can be used directly without further
purification. Phosphate-buffered solution (LOD) [50 mM, pH 5.0] was
prepared with KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4.

4.2 Sample Characterization
The ultraviolet-visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra and fluorescence spectrum were
recorded using a Hitachi U-2900 (Hitachi, Japan) UV–vis spectrophotometer
and a Hitachi F-4600 (Hitachi, Japan) fluorescence spectrophotometer,
respectively. The images of transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
were taken using a JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscope (Japan)
to probe the surface morphology and assess the average diameter of
N-GQDs. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were characterized
using a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). X-ray diffraction patterns were measured using an X-ray
diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
data were collected by a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi. The fluorescence
lifetime was measured with an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 fluorescence
spectrophotometer with excitation at 360 nm.

4.3 Preparation
of N-GQDs
N-GQDs were
synthesized with sodium citrate and triethanolamine as raw materials
by a one-step microwave synthesis method. In a typical process of
synthesis, 2.0 g of sodium citrate and 10 mL of triethanolamine were
added to 20 mL reagent bottle, stirred for 3 h until a transparent
liquid was formed, and heated using a domestic microwave oven (Galanz,
750 W) for 2 min at the middle and low fire (80 °C). After cooling
to room temperature, the products were centrifuged at 8000 rpm and
the upper liquid was collected. The resultant N-GQDs were stored in
a 4 °C refrigerator. Before use, the faint yellow solution obtained
was subsequently purified with dialysis in deionized water using a
dialysis bag (MWCO = 500 Da) for 24 h or more to remove the residue.
The same method was used to synthesize undoped GQDs without adding
triethanolamine.

4.4 Fluorescence Detection
of Fe3+
For the fluorescence detection of metal
ions, we studied the influence
of metal ions on the fluorescence (FL) intensity of N-GQDs in a PBS
buffer solution at room temperature. The detection of Fe3+ was performed by the following steps: first, in a typical procedure,
600 μL solution of N-GQDs and 300 μL of the PBS buffer
solution (50 mM, pH 5) were fully mixed and then added to 100 μL
of various metal ions solution of the same concentration (1 mM), including
Co2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Bi2+, Na+, Mn2+,Cd2+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Pb2+, and Cr3+; all of the
aforementioned ion solutions were obtained from the corresponding
nitrate (NO3–) and chloride (Cl–) reagents. They were reacted at room temperature for a few minutes;
then, the fluorescent intensity of each sample was monitored in turn.
Next, different concentrations of the Fe3+ solution from
0 to 1 mM were mixed with the as-prepared solution and the PBS buffer
solution; the volume and reaction conditions of each substance are
the same as above. Then, the fluorescent spectra were measured for
each sample.

4.5 Fluorescent Ink

synthesized quantum dots is used as ink, and a cotton swab is used
to draw patterns or letters in various shapes on a filter paper.
