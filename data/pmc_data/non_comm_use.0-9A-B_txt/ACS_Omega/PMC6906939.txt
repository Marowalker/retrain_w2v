Effective screening methods for the development of glycopolymers
as molecular recognition materials are desirable for the discovery
of novel biofunctional materials. A glycopolymer library was prepared
to obtain guidelines for the design of glycopolymers for the recognition
of cholera toxin B subunits (CTB). Glycopolymers with varying ratios
of hydrophobic and sugar units were synthesized by reversible addition
fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. N-tert-Butylacrylamide, N-phenylacrylamide,
and N-cyclohexylacrylamide as hydrophobic units were
copolymerized in the polymer backbone, and galactose, which contributes
to CTB recognition, was introduced into the side chains by “post-click”
chemistry. The thiol-terminated glycopolymers were immobilized on
a gold surface. The polymer immobilization substrate was analyzed
in terms of interaction with galactose recognition proteins (CTB,
peanut agglutinin, and Ricinus communis agglutinin I) using surface plasmon resonance imaging. The polymers
with high ratios of sugar and hydrophobic units had the strongest
interactions with the CTB, which was different from the trend with
peanut agglutinin and Ricinus communis agglutinin I. The binding constant of the CTB with the glycopolymer
with hydrophobic units was 4.1 × 106 M–1, which was approximately eight times larger than that of the polymer
without hydrophobic units. A correlation was observed between the
log P value and the binding constant, indicating
that the hydrophobic interaction played an important role in binding.
New guidelines for the design of recognition materials were obtained
by our screening method.

Introduction
Carbohydrates are used as the energy sources for living organisms,
and the carbohydrates on cell surfaces also play important roles in
living systems.1 Carbohydrates mediate
various biological phenomena including bacterial and viral infections
and cancer metastasis by interaction with proteins. Generally, bioactive
carbohydrates composed of oligosaccharides are expensive to produce
because they are difficult to synthesize and extract.2,3 Thus, it is difficult commercially use oligosaccharides as biomaterials.
Therefore, there is a demand for substitutes that can be obtained
inexpensively and in large quantities.

Glycopolymers, which have sugar units on the side chains, have
been used as scaffolds for the development of compounds mimicking
oligosaccharides.4−6 Monovalent carbohydrates only bind weakly to carbohydrate
recognition proteins (lectins); however, the interaction between multivalent
carbohydrates and lectins can be amplified, which is termed as “the
cluster glycoside effect”.7,8 This effect
is essential to provide glycan capability artificially and can be
exhibited by glycopolymers. Glycopolymers that have high affinity
and specificity to various target proteins have been developed, and
this development provides guidelines for the design of biofunctional
materials.

Many groups have investigated the interaction of glycopolymers
with viruses, bacteria, and lectins, and various glycopolymers with
different sugar densities and distances between sugars and linker
lengths have been studied.9−13 However, the optimal design of glycopolymers for a specific target
is difficult because the structures of the target proteins are complex
and diverse. Recently, screening methods using glycopolymer libraries
with various parameters have attracted attention. The Bradley group
has reported the preparation of a glycopolymer library using a substrate
and high-throughput analyses with lectins, showing the utility of
the library method.14

Vibrio cholerae can cause serious
diseases. The natural ligand of the cholera toxin secreted by V. cholerae is the oligosaccharide GM1,15,16 which is too expensive to produce for use in inhibitors and diagnostic
medicine. To obtain a more readily available material for such applications,
many groups have developed inexpensive GM1 functional mimics that
strongly bind to cholera toxin, using glycopolymer screening methods.17−20 Our group has shown that a glycopolymer with galactose (Gal) and
neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is advantageous for CTB recognition in an
analysis using a glycopolymer library incorporating various sugar
units.21 The Gibson group has prepared
a glycopolymer library containing monomers incorporating hydrophobic
groups that could facilitate improvements in the CTB recognition ability.22 However, both the synthesis and screening methods
for these libraries were tedious and ineffective, requiring multistep
synthesis, and the development of inexpensive GM1 mimics with sufficient
affinity has not yet been achieved.

In the present study, hydrophobic monomers that are readily available
were copolymerized into a polymer scaffold by reversible addition
fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization with the aim of
further improving the affinity for CTB. Gal was attached to the polymer
side chain by “post-click” chemistry because it has
been reported that Gal is an essential structure for the GM1-recognition
protein, CTB.23 In the high throughput
screening of sugar–protein interactions, a sensitive screening
method is essential, and optics are useful because a precise method
is necessary. In this study, surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI),
which is capable of rapidly screening large libraries with high sensitivity
and does not require the labeling of proteins, was used.24,25 The glycopolymer was immobilized on a gold-deposited substrate using
a terminal thiol.21,26 The sugar and hydrophobic unit
ratios were analyzed for the effects on the ability of the glycopolymers
to recognize the CTB and other Gal lectins, using SPRI of the prepared
substrates.

Results
Preparation of Glycopolymers with Hydrophobic Groups
4-Trimethylsilyl-3-butynyl acrylamide (TMS BtnAAm) and acrylamide
(AAm) were used as the alkyne monomer and spacer, respectively. N-tert-Butylacrylamide (TBAm), N-phenylacrylamide (PhAAm), and N-cyclohexylacrylamide
(CyHex), which have different degrees of hydrophobicity, were used
as the hydrophobic monomers. These monomers were incorporated to evaluate
the contribution of hydrophobic groups to CTB recognition. The monomers
were polymerized in different ratios by RAFT polymerization. Glycopolymers
with 10, 30, and 50% sugar units were prepared to evaluate the interactions
between the protein and the sugar groups in the glycopolymers. The
ratios of the alkyne and functional groups in the obtained polymer
backbones were confirmed by 1H NMR, and the values corresponded
to the monomer feed ratios (Table 1, Figure 1). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis revealed that the Mw/Mn values of the
polymer backbones were low and the relative molecular weights were
close to the theoretical values (Table 1). The results suggested that living radical polymerization
was achieved successfully, and the glycopolymers were synthesized
as designed. The TMS groups were deprotected in a tetrahydrofuran
(THF) solution with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) or in aqueous
solution with KOH for activation of the alkyne groups in the polymer
backbones. The deprotection of the TMS groups was confirmed by the
disappearance of the peak at 0.13 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra.

by 1H NMR.

e Relative molecular weight and polydispersity
index were determined by SEC analysis calibrated with a polystyrene
standard. The eluent was 10 mM LiBr DMF.

f Relative molecular weight and polydispersity
index were determined by SEC analysis calibrated with a pullulan standard.
The eluent was 10 mM LiBr DMSO because of poor solubility in water.

g Monomer conversions and theoretical
molecular weight were calculated from the yield because of the overlap
of monomer and CyHex peaks.

The glycopolymers were obtained by postmodification of azide-terminated
Gal into the polymer backbones. The progress of the copper-catalyzed
azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction was confirmed by 1H NMR: the ratio of the integral values of the anomer peak
at approximately 5.6 ppm and the peak from the alkyl group next to
the triazole at approximately 8.0 ppm reached 1:2. The relative molecular
weights of the glycopolymers were evaluated by SEC analysis (Table 2). The glycopolymers
with PhAAm or CyHex (G10P20, G30P20, G50P20, and G50C20) were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) because they were not soluble in water. The relative
molecular weights of the glycopolymers with TBAm (G10T20, G30T20, and G50T20) were smaller than
those of the glycopolymers without hydrophobic units (G10, G30, and G50). For example, the molecular
weight of G50T20 with TBAm was smaller than that of G50 without hydrophobic groups. The results suggested that
the glycopolymers incorporating hydrophobic groups were slightly aggregated
in water.

Analysis of the Interaction between the Glycopolymers and the
Proteins
The load concentrations of CTB, peanut agglutinin
(PNA), and ricinus communis agglutinin
I (RCA120) were 1 μM, 500 nM, and 50 nM, respectively
(Figure 2). In Figure 3, the x- and y-axis represent the hydrophobic units incorporated
into the glycopolymers and the ratio of the incorporated sugar units,
respectively. The z-axis shows the SPR reflection
intensity change (SPRI signal) on the glycopolymer-immobilized surface
after injection of the protein solution for 1 h.

Figure 2 Schematic illustration of the current investigation.

Figure 3 SPRI signals of the glycopolymer library with (a) CTB (1 μM),
(b) PNA (500 nM) and (c) RCA 120 (50 nM).

The SPRI signal changes after the addition of the proteins are
shown in Figure 3.
All the glycopolymers showed a SPRI signal change after the addition
of the proteins. The SPRI intensities differed according to the ratios
of Gal and the hydrophobic units incorporated in the polymers. The
CTB binding was shown to be dependent on the Gal ratio. The glycopolymers
with higher Gal ratios showed the largest SPRI signals. The glycopolymers
with 50% Gal tended to show the highest adsorption of CTB. PNA and
RCA120 showed a different tendency regarding the Gal incorporation
ratio compared with CTB. The polymer with 30% Gal showed the highest
amount of adsorption after the addition of PNA or RCA120. The effect of hydrophobicity was also investigated by comparing
the signals for the polymers with the same sugar ratios (Figure 3). CTB binding was
amplified by the addition of hydrophobic groups as the SPRI signals
of the glycopolymers with TBAm and PhAAm (blue and green bars, Figure 3) were larger than
those of the polymers without hydrophobic units (red bars, Figure 3). In contrast, the
SPRI signals of the polymers, with and without hydrophobic units,
were approximately the same for PNA and RCA120 binding.

Calculation of the Binding Constants for the Proteins
The binding constants for each glycopolymer were calculated from
the SPRI screening results. The curves formed by the SPRI signal plots
for the protein solutions for each concentration were analyzed by
fitting based on eq 1. For the CTB solution, the binding constants for the surface immobilized G50, G50T20, and G50P20 were 0.39,
2.7, and 4.1 × 106 M–1, respectively
(Figure 4). The binding
constant of the glycopolymer incorporating hydrophobic groups (G50P20) was eight times larger than that of the glycopolymer
without hydrophobic groups (G50). The binding constant
of G50P20 with PhAAm was larger than that of G50T20 with TBAm. The binding constants of PNA for the surface-immobilized G50, G50T20, and G50P20 were 8.8,
9.5, and 11.7 × 106 M–1, respectively.
The binding constant of G50P20 with hydrophobic units
was slightly larger than that of G50 without hydrophobic
groups, but the increase in binding between G50P20 and G50 was only 1.3 times. In the case of RCA120,
the binding constants for the surface-immobilized G50, G50T20, and G50P20 were 3.1, 2.5, and
2.5 × 108 M–1, respectively. The
binding constants of G50T20 and G50P20 with
hydrophobic units were slightly smaller than that of G50 without hydrophobic groups.

with PNA, and (d) Ka values with RCA120.

The binding constants calculated in the previous section were evaluated
using the partition coefficient of the log P value,
which is a calculated value representing the hydrophobicity of chemical
substances. The x- and y-axis represent
the log P value of the hydrophobic group monomer
(AAm, TBAm, PhAAm, and CyHex) in each glycopolymer and the binding
constant for each immobilized glycopolymer, respectively (Figure 5). Glycopolymers
incorporating highly hydrophobic monomers had large binding constants.

Inhibition Assay with Addition of the Natural Ligand GM1
An inhibition assay was performed to investigate the site of CTB
that interacts with the glycopolymers (Figure 6). The vertical axis of the graph represents
the SPRI signal after flowing the protein solution for 1 h. The left
and right bars are the results for the CTB solution (250 nM) and a
mixed solution with CTB (250 nM) and GM1 (10 μM), respectively.
A SPRI signal appeared in all the polymer-immobilized substrates after
the addition of the CTB solution. In contrast, no SPRI signal change
was observed after the addition of the mixed solution.

GM1. The polymers used were G50, G50T20,
and G50P20.

Discussion
Hydrophobic units have been frequently added to the Gal units in
glycopolymers to enhance the molecular recognition with CTB.27 The Bundle group reported that the ligand library
conjugated with multivalent polymer scaffolds assisted in identifying
hydrophobic units to complement the affinity of Gal for CTB.19 The Gibson group has reported that the affinity
and selectivity of glycopolymers toward CTB and PNA were changed by
incorporation of monomers with a secondary hydrophobic motif for Neu5Ac
recognition sites next to Gal.22 In this
study, an amplification effect on CTB binding was observed with glycopolymers
having hydrophobic units and Gal residues. Inhibition assays indicated
that the hydrophobic group performed a similar function to that of
Neu5Ac in GM1, and that the hydrophobic unit and Gal interacted cooperatively
with carbohydrate recognition domains.16 The results of the present study differ from Gibson’s report
in that the interaction with the proteins had no correlation with
the log P value of the hydrophobic groups in the
glycopolymers, and the hydrophobic group might interfere with the
interaction with PNA.22 The ligands on
the side chains might have been able to reach the carbohydrate recognition
sites because the polymers used in the present study are flexible
compared with the polymers used by other groups. Although there are
still some issues to consider, the introduction of Gal and hydrophobic
units to a glycopolymer has the potential to be effective for enhancing
CTB recognition.

The contribution of the hydrophobic groups to the CTB (PDB-ID: 3CHB(28)) binding was investigated based on the crystal structure
from the PDB. CTB was found to have hydrophilic amino acids on the
surface, but PNA (PDB-ID: 2PEL(29)) and RCA120 (PDB-ID: 1RZO) had hydrophobic groups scattered on the surface. CTB interacted
strongly with the glycopolymers with hydrophobic units, and PNA and
RCA120 did not interact with the hydrophobic glycopolymers,
suggesting that the hydrophobic amino acid residues in Gal lectins
contribute to the interaction only with the CTB. Unexpectedly, hydrophobic
residues were found not only in CTB but also in PNA and RCA120, though a hydrophobic interaction was not observed with PNA or RCA120. One possibility is that some of the hydrophobic residues
in CTB contribute to the recognition of Neu5Ac in GM1 or the hydrophobic
unit in the glycopolymers and that the hydrophobic residues in PNA
and RCA120 contribute to the protein folding. At the carbohydrate
recognition sites in the CTB, Trp88, a hydrophobic amino acid, interact
with Gal of GM1. The acetyl group of Neu5Ac in GM1 induced hydrophobic
interaction with Glu11 and Tyr12, and Tyr12 form a hydrophobic cavity
in the vicinity of Neu5Ac residue. The enhanced binding of CTB with
molecules containing hydrophobic groups has been reported.19,22,27 Further studies are needed to
determine whether hydrophobic groups acted on this hydrophobic pocket.
Elucidation of hydrophobic units interacting on the cavity requires
further study.

The binding constant between G50P20 and CTB was 4.1
× 106 M–1, which was the highest
value in this study, and this affinity is comparable to antigen–antibody
interactions; this suggested that G50P20 may be applicable
as a biofunctional material for molecular recognition. However, this
affinity was still much weaker than the natural ligand for CTB, GM1
(Ka = 1010 to 1012 M–1). The strong binding of GM1 is achieved by
multiple hydrogen bonding between the amino acids in the protein and
the sugars in GM1, including Gal, GalNAc, and Neu5Ac.28 The binding constant of G50P20 is thought
to be smaller than that of GM1 because only Gal in G50P20 functions as a sugar ligand with CTB. In addition, while the rigid
structure of GM1 can suppress the entropy loss by binding with CTB,
the flexible side chains of the glycopolymer G50P20 provide
the potential advantage that the ligands can reach the carbohydrate
recognition domains, but this advantage is canceled by an increased
entropy loss.19

We have previously reported another GM1 polymer mimic, containing
Gal and Neu5Ac, which had a binding constant of 2.7 × 109 M–1, which is much stronger binding than
that observed for G50P20.21 A possible reason for the weaker binding of G50P20 is
that G50P20 was composed of only 50% Gal, which is a
lower amount than in the previous polymer; glycopolymers with higher
sugar ratios might have better performance because of the cluster
glycoside effect. The weak affinity of G50P20 indicated
that the hydrophobic units could induce hydrophobic interactions but
could not substitute for other interactions, such as electrical interactions
and hydrogen bonds. Although hydrophobic groups have often been proposed
to be substitutes for oligosaccharides and sialic acid in synthetic
compounds,27 the design and scope of the
application of hydrophobic groups require careful consideration.

Conclusions
The glycopolymers with high sugar ratios and strong hydrophobicity
showed strong interactions with the CTB. For PNA and RCA120, the observed trends for glycopolymers that showed strong affinities
were clearly different compared with the CTB; with these proteins,
the hydrophobic units did not provide effective protein recognition.
Quantitative binding constant analysis of the immobilized glycopolymers
and CTB was performed to confirm the contribution of the hydrophobic
units, and a correlation between the Ka values and the log P values of the introduced hydrophobic
units was observed. Our analysis suggested that the hydrophobic units
contributed to a hydrophobic interaction and functioned cooperatively
with the Gal units. We were able to provide new design guidelines
for glycopolymers for CTB recognition. This screening method using
SPRI could be a useful approach for developing new molecular recognition
materials in the future. Research is in progress in our group on new
development methods for glycopolymers as molecular recognition materials
that are comparable to current drug-screening methods.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Polymer Backbones30
All polymer backbones were prepared by RAFT polymerization
(Figure 1). Briefly,
AAm, TMS BtnAAm, and hydrophobic acrylamide derivatives (TBAm, PhAAm,
and CyHex) were dissolved in DMSO with 2-cyanopropan-2-yl butyl trithiocarbonate
(CPBTC) and AIBN. Polymer structures are shown in the Supporting Information. The monomer feed ratio
and target degree of polymerization were varied (Table 1). The solution was degassed
by freeze–thaw cycles (three times) and placed in an oil bath
at 70 °C for 18 h. The polymer backbones were purified by dialysis
against a solvent mixture of MeOH and acetone (MeOH/acetone = 1:1,
MWCO = 3.5 kDa) or Milli-Q water (MWCO = 3.5 kDa).

Deprotection of TMS Groups from the Polymer Backbones30
For G10–G30, the
polymer (100 mg) was dissolved in a mixture of Milli-Q water (10 mL):
KOHaq (1 M, 3 mL) (Figure 1). The solution was kept stirring at room temperature
for 3 h. The product was obtained by freeze-drying. For T50 and G30T20–G50C20, the polymer (100 mg) was
dissolved in dry THF (5 mL), and TBAF solution (1 mL, 1.0 M in THF)
was added into the solution. The solution was kept stirring at room
temperature for 9 h. THF was removed under reduced pressure. The deprotected
polymer was dialyzed against a mixture of MeOH and acetone (MeOH/acetone
= 1:1, MWCO = 3.5 kDa).

Carbohydrate Addition by “Post-Click” Chemistry30
The CuAAC reaction was conducted between
the alkyne groups in the polymer backbone and azide-terminated Gal,
where the molar amounts of the alkyne units were calculated based
on the monomer ratio in the polymer. The polymer (20 mg), azide-terminated
Gal (3 equiv to alkyne unit), and CuSO4 (0.4 equiv to alkyne
unit) were dissolved in Milli-Q water (1.5 mL). Tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine
(0.4 equiv to alkyne unit) in MeCN (1.5 mL) was added to the reaction
mixture. Sodium ascorbate (l-Asc·Na) (2 equiv to alkyne
unit) was added, and the reaction mixture was kept at 60 °C for
6 h with N2 bubbling. The products were purified by dialysis
(Spectra/Por 7; MWCO 3500) against water with hydrochloric acid (pH
= 4) for 24 h. The solution was changed subsequently to pure water
(pH = 7) and kept for 24 h, and the product was obtained by freeze-drying.

The glycopolymers used in this investigation are shown in Figure 1. We named glycopolymers
as follows: the numbers following Gal show the incorporation ratio
of Gal in the polymer, where G10 means 10% incorporation
of Gal in the polymer. The letters and numbers represent the type
and ratio of the hydrophobic group incorporated into the polymers,
respectively.

SPRI Chips Preparation and SPRI Measurement21
In all the experiments, the glass substrate of
S-TIM35 (Vidtec, Fukuoka, Japan) was exposed to UV/O3 light
for 30 min. Sigmacote was put on the substrates for 1 min and rinsed
with hexane, EtOH, and Milli-Q water. Cr (1 nm) and Au (50 nm) were
deposited on the substrates and rinsed with EtOH and Milli-Q water.
An aqueous solution of each polymer (0.5 μL, 10 g/L) was put
onto each gold dot on the deposited substrate, and the glass substrate
was incubated for 3 h. The chip was rinsed with Milli-Q water and
blown with air to dry (Figure 2).

All of the SPR measurements were performed with the
Kretschmann configuration. A 60° S-TIH11 prism (Sigmakoki Co.,
Ltd. Saitama, Japan) was used in all the measurements. A p-polarized
helium–neon laser (λ = 632.8 nm) was used as the light
source, and the reflected light at the interface was detected using
a photodiode detector. The reflectivity of the light was measured
as a function of the incidence angle (angle scan) and as a function
of time at a fixed incidence angle (kinetic scan). Prepared chips
were set in the SPRI chip cell. Before the protein solution in PBS
was flowed into the cell, 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH
7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl) was flowed through (0.1 mL/min) until
the SPR reflectivity became stable. The SPR reflectivity change (SPRI
signal) was measured after injecting the protein solution (CTB, PNA,
or RCA120) at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min for 1 h (Figure 2).

Measurement of the Affinity between the Polymers and Proteins
SPRI chips were prepared in accordance with the method described
above and set in the SPRI chip cell. Before the measurement, 10 mM
PBS was flowed into the cell at 0.1 mL/min until the SPRI signal became
stable. The protein solution (CTB, PNA, or RCA120) was
injected with a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min, and the order of the injection
was from the most diluted to the most concentrated solution. In the
measurement, the SPRI signal was regarded as the amount of protein
adsorption. The binding constants of each protein were calculated
with the Langmuir isotherm using the SPRI signals 1  ΔR, ΔRmax, c, and Ka are the SPRI signal, the maximum SPRI signal, the protein
concentration, and the binding constant, respectively. Based on eq 1, the plots of the SPRI
signals were analyzed by nonlinear regression to derive the binding
constants.

Inhibition Assay for the Carbohydrate Recognition Sites of CTB
SPRI chips were prepared in accordance with the method described
above and set in the SPRI chip cell. Before the measurement, 10 mM
PBS was flowed into the cell at 0.1 mL/min until the SPR reflectivity
became stable. Protein solutions were injected with a flow rate of
0.1 mL/min for 1 h. A mixture of CTB (250 nM) and GM1 (10 μM)
was used. GM1 used was whole lipid and not only the saccharide unit.
GM1 was soluble in a monomeric state which was confirmed by dynamic
light scattering (Figure S44). The concentration
was under the critical micelle concentration of GM1.31
