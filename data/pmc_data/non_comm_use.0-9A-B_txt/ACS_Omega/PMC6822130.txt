A novel nitrogen–phosphorus
flame retardant (P–N
FR) based on phosphonamidate, dimethyl N,N′-1,3-phenylenebis(P-methylphosphonamidate) (DMPMP),
was successfully synthesized and its flame-retarding performances
and thermal degradation were compared with those of other P–N
FRs and a phosphorus-based FR such as resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate)
(RDP). DMPMP was applied to acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
(ABS) and ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) to investigate the factors
governing the flame-retarding behaviors of P–N FRs which would
make them efficient for noncharrable polymers. V-0 ratings were achieved
at 20 wt % loading of DMPMP for ABS and at a much lesser amount of
DMPMP loading (10 wt %) for EVA. Meanwhile, no rating and V-2 were
achieved even at 20–30 wt % loading of other P–N FRs
or RDP for ABS and EVA, respectively. The results from thermogravimetric
analysis, Fourier transform infrared, and UL-94V indicated that DMPMP
is a highly efficient FR and acts mainly in a gas-phase flame-retarding
mode of action. The condensed phase of DMPMP also contributed to the
flame retardancy property through −NH– groups which
tendentiously generate a nitrogen–phosphorus-rich residue because
of the intermolecular coupling transesterification reaction. These
results demonstrated the assumption that DMPMP has a high P content
and good hydrostability, which exhibits good flame retardancy for
noncharrable polymers such as ABS and EVA.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Recently, restrictions
on the use of halogen flame retardants (FRs)
have resulted in the development of eco-friendly FRs, and the phosphorus-containing
FR is one of the well-known candidates.1−5 Among them, organophosphorus and phosphorus–nitrogen FRs
appear to be very effective fire retardants and they produce less
toxic moiety and smoke during combustion.6−11

The mode of FR action works either in the condensed phase
or the
gas phase or in both phases through a physical and/or chemical mechanism.
As a consequence, they intervene in the combustion during thermal
degradation, ignition, or flame spread. The mechanism of phosphorus-containing
FRs acts in the gas phase via active radicals such as PO•, PO2•, and HPO• playing a role as scavengers of H• and OH•. The flame-retardant efficiency
of these FRs is also contributed from residual char acting on condensed
phase to protect material from flammable gases, oxygen, and heat.12−15

Another recently studied new class of flame retardant which
meets
flammability and environment issues is nitrogen-phosphorus (P–N)
containing compound. P–N FRs have higher thermal stability
and produce less toxic smoke than phosphorus-based FRs.9,16−19 Lately, we reported some P–N FRs based on bisphosphoramidate
which promote more residual char formation than the corresponding
bisphosphate FRs and they exhibit outstanding fire retardancy for
charrable polymers such as polycarbonate (PC) in the condensed phase.20 Besides, the P–N compound (DPPMP) providing
a gas-phase action exhibited good flame retardancy for noncharrable
polymers such as ethylene–vinylacetate (EVA) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
(ABS).21 DPPMP exhibits good flame retardancy;
however, it has a low phosphorus (P) content and a large loading is
therefore required to obtain good flame retardancy for ABS and EVA
(V-0 ranking).

As mentioned in the literature,22−26 the P content of FRs is one of the most critical
factors governing their flame retardancy. Commercial aliphatic phosphates
in general have a higher P content than the aromatic ones because
of their smaller molecular weight. However, they are more sensitive
to hydrolysis. For that reason, it is not easy to attain both good
hydrostability and high P content. It is hypothesized that to overcome
this disadvantage, both aliphatic moiety with a high P content and
thermostable aromatic moiety would be combined in one structure of
FRs.

Building on the above assumption, in this study, a novel
P–N
compound based on phosphonamidate containing aromatic and aliphatic
groups with both a good hydrostability and high P content, which exhibits
good flame retardancy for noncharrable polymers such as EVA and ABS
in the gas phase, was synthesized and compared with other FRs based
on bisphosphoramidate and bisphosphate acting in the condensed phase.
Their FR behavior and thermal stability were also studied.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of a Novel Phosphonamidate
FR: DMPMP
Scheme 1 shows the
synthesis route of dimethyl N,N′-1,3-phenylenebis(P-methylphosphonamidate
(DMPMP) via the two-step reaction. Methyl phosphonic dichloride (MPDC)
was not available from commercial sources and therefore was synthesized
in our laboratory following the procedure published in the previous
report.27 The 1H NMR spectrum
of MPDC showed a signal at 2.55 ppm which corresponds to the protons
of CH3–P. An methyl methyl phosphochloridate (MMPC)
compound, an intermediate reagent, was obtained by reacting methanol
with MPDC, and its subsequent reaction with 1,3-phenylene diamine
gave the final product, DMPMP, with high purity. The 1H
and 31P NMR spectra of DMPMP are shown in Figure 1A,B, respectively. The clear
chemical shifts of the protons are observed at 6.75 (s, 1H), 7.00
(m, 1H), and 7.61 (d, 2H) which correspond to the protons of the aromatic
phenyl group. Besides, the clear chemical shifts of the protons are
observed at 6.55 (d, 2H), 1.48 (d, 6H), and 3.55 (d, 6H) which correspond
to the protons of N–H, CH3–P, and CH3–O–P, respectively. A single phosphorus compound
with a single peak at 29.463 ppm was also clearly confirmed by the 31P NMR spectrum.

Figure 1 (A) 1H NMR and (B) 31P
NMR spectra of DMPMP.

Scheme 1 Synthesis Route of
DMPMP
To confirm its successful synthesis,
the Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrum of DMPMP was analyzed spectroscopically by employing
FT-IR experiments presented in Figure 2. From Figure 2, the adsorption signal of the saturated carbon (sp3) is observed at 2892–3018 cm–1. The peak
at 961 cm–1 corresponds to the vibration of the
P–N bonding. The peak at 3186 cm–1 corresponds
to the vibration/stretching band of N–H. The peaks at 1045
and 1223 cm–1 can be assigned to the stretching
bands of P–O–C and P=O, respectively. The shoulder
at 1507 cm–1 corresponds to the vibration of the
CH3–P(O)– group. The results from 1H NMR, 31P NMR, and FT-IR indicated that the high purity
DMPMP was successfully synthesized.

2.2 Thermal Degradation Properties
Figure 3 shows the thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) curves in a nitrogen atmosphere from 50–600
°C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min for the single phosphate,
two phosphoramidate, and single novel phosphonamidate compounds employed
in this study. In Figure 3, it is observed that the thermal degradation properties and
yield of charred residue of the FR are highly dependent on the type
of pendent group attached to the center aromatic compound, that is,
resorcinol or 1,3-phenylene diamine. At 600 °C, resorcinol bis(diphenyl
phosphate) (RDP) leaves less charred residue (4.6 wt %) than N-RDP
and 4N-RDP (32.3 and 50.4 wt %, respectively). P–N compounds
have a tendency to leave more charred residue than P compounds with
the corresponding structure. Considering the initial degradation temperature
(Tid), the Tid of N-RDP is higher than that of RDP. Therefore, P–N FRs exhibit
greater thermal stability and leave more charred residue than the
FRs having only phosphorus elements.

Figure 3 TGA curves of FRs (in nitrogen, 10 °C/min).

The other point we claim is that P–N FRs
containing −NH–
groups tendentiously generate a nitrogen-rich residue because of the
intermolecular coupling transesterification reaction. This has also
been reported in the literature.20 This
is also found in the case of DMPMP; while RDP contains no −NH–
in its structure, no transesterification reaction is observed and
less charred residue is found. However, DMPMP decomposed in one long
step and left a less amount of charred residue (20.8 wt %) than N-RDP
and 4N-RDP, which indicates that the gas phase mechanism is dominant
for the DMPMP compound. We also speculate that CH3–P(O)–
is responsible for the decomposition step of DMPMP occurring at lower
temperatures than the other P–N compounds. Scheme 2 is proposed to present the
decomposition with the mode of action being mainly in the gas phase
and the intermolecular transesterification reaction of DMPMP in this
study.

Scheme 2 Plausible Thermal Degradation Mechansim of DMPMP
To better understand the char formation of these
P–N FRs,
the solid residues of these P–N FRs obtained at 600 °C
were investigated by FT-IR. The thermal degradation of N-RDP, 4N-RDP,
and DMPMP was performed under nitrogen in the TGA apparatus. After
performing TGA at 600 °C, the residual char was taken out and
analyzed by FT-IR measurement. The results are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 FT-IR spectra of residues
of phosphoramidates and phosphonamidate
at 600 °C.

We previously reported that P–N-rich
residual chars are
formed through the interaction between the hydrogen atoms in the weak
acid of P–NH–C and the phosphate groups of N-RDP and
4N-RDP.20 These results are compared with
those of DMPMP in this study. The distinct absorption signal at 3186
cm–1 which was characteristic to the stretching
vibration of N–H disappeared, and the peak of the P–N–C
bonding at 961 cm–1 was shifted to a lower wavenumber
(936 cm–1). These certainly recommend that the residual
char of DMPMP also undergoes intermolecular coupling by the transesterification
of the secondary amine (−NH−) in phosphonamidate, and
P–N-rich residual chars are also formed through the interaction
between the hydrogen atoms in the weak acid of P–NH–C
and phosphonate. Besides, the vibration band of saturated C–H
appearing at 2892–3018 cm–1 also decreases
and gradually disappears. The peaks of P=O stretching appearing
at 1223 cm–1 become broadened and are shifted to
higher wavenumbers (1196 cm–1) at 600 °C. In
addition, the peak of CH3–P(O) appearing at 1507
cm–1 disappears. All these results indicate that
DMPMP also undergoes decomposition by eliminating hydrocarbons to
generate the PO• radical, thus giving it gas-phase
action flame-retarding efficiency which was discussed above in the
thermal degradation mechanism of DMPMP presented in Scheme 2.

2.3 Flame-Retardant
Performances
The
flame-retarding performances of the FRs used in this work were investigated
on noncharrable polymers, that is, ABS and EVA. The amounts of the
FRs added to ABS and EVA were 20–30 and 10–20 wt %,
respectively. Tables 1 and 2 show the UL-94V results for ABS and
EVA formulations, respectively.

ABS with and without
FRs

4N-RDP	10.86	80/20	2.17	V-2	yes	
DMPMP	21.20	90/10	2.12	V-0	no	
In Tables 1 and 2, the UL-94V
tests are evaluated for these formulations.
The mixtures containing RDP, N-RDP, or 4N-RDP give no-rating and V-2
in the UL-94V results for ABS and EVA, respectively. In contrast,
the mixtures containing DMPMP give a UL-94 V-0 ranking for both ABS
and EVA, even though the P content in the formulations of these mixtures
is not very different. This means that the fire-retarding efficiency
strongly depends on the structure and fire-retarding mechanism of
the FR. The UL-94V results demonstrate more clearly the effect of
the structure of the FR on its fire-retarding ability. The flame-retarding
behavior of DMPMP was again seen to function by the gas-phase mode
of action. Moreover, we proposed that the minimum P content of 4–5
wt % is required to get effective gas phase acting flame retardancy
in a mixture for a noncharrable polymer such as ABS.28 This can be reasserted for DMPMP, which is a gas phase
acting FR and shows a V-0 rating for ABS at 4.24 wt % of P in the
formulation. In addition, we proposed DPPMP as a promising P–N
FR21 which gives a V-0 ranking at a 30
wt % FR loading for ABS in the gas-phase mode of action. DMPMP with
a higher P content in its structure than DPPMP gives a V-0 rating
at a lower FR loading for ABS (20 wt %) in the gas-phase mode of action.
This indicates that one of the most crucial factors governing the
flame retardancy of FRs is the P content. All these results suggest
that the fire-retarding efficiency of the FR significantly depends
on two significant factors, its structure and P content.

The
abovementioned discussion was further confirmed by TGA of the
formulations, and the results are given in Figures 5 and 6.

Figure 5 TGA curves
of the mixtures of FRs with ABS (in nitrogen, 10 °C/min).

Figure 6 TGA curves of the mixtures of FRs with EVA (in nitrogen,
10 °C/min).

The TGA results in Figures 5 and 6 indicate that the amount of
the residual char of the mixture containing FRs is directly proportional
to the char formation of FR trends in the abovementioned discussion.
The TGA curves of the mixtures of different FRs with ABS in Figure 5 show that the Tid of the mixtures is lower than that of ABS,
indicating that the presence of the FRs decreases Tid and leads to the destabilization of the ABS matrix
below 450 °C.

It is widely known that the flame retardancy
of phosphate compounds
such as RDP is inefficient for highly flammable polymers such as ABS
when blended with a single FR system,29 and we previously reported that P–N FRs based on phosphoramidate
easily operate in the condensed phase mode of action.20 In this study, N-RDP and 4N-RDP were incorporated into
ABS for no rating in UL-94 results because of the condensed phase
mode of action leaving a remarkable amount of charred residue (12
wt % in the formulation with ABS for N-RDP and 15.9 wt % in the formulation
with ABS for 4N-RDP). Otherwise, the TGA results of the ABS/DMPMP
mixture show 6.0 wt % charred residue, which is proportional to the
char-yielding behavior of DMPMP, and a V-0 rating is observed for
this mixture, suggesting that the gas-phase action dominates over
the condensed phase one. Furthermore, the TGA curve of ABS/DMPMP mixture
shows a lower initial decomposition temperature than neat ABS. This
is owing to the decomposition of DMPMP and/or the products from DMPMP
and ABS interaction during thermal degradation. To support for the
effect of DMPMP on the thermal decomposition behavior of ABS or EVA,
the comparison between calculated and experimentally determined TGA
curves was studied (Figure 7). These TGA curves should be different if there is interaction
between the FR and polymeric material. However, there are almost no
differences between the two calculated and experimental TGA curves.
The reason is probably that DMPMP with low loading evaporates almost
completely during thermal decomposition.

Figure 7 Calculated and experimental
TGA curves of (A) ABS + 20 wt % DMPMP
and (B) EVA + 10 wt % DMPMP.

These results suggest that P–N FRs based on phosphonamidate
with the CH3–P(O)– group in their structures
tend to function by the gas-phase mode of action in their flame-retarding
mechanism more than the condensed phase mode of action (Figure 8).

mode of action of polymer/DMPMP in this
study.

3 Conclusions
In order to look into factors influencing the fire retardant performances
of P–N FRs which would make them efficient for noncharrable
polymers such as ABS and EVA and operate in the gas-phase mode of
action, a novel P–N FR (DMPMP) based on phosphonamidate was
synthesized and its FR performances and thermal decomposition were
compared with those of P–N FRs based on phosphoramidates and
RDP which function in the condensed phase mode of action. From the
TGA and FT-IR results, it was clearly observed that P–N FRs
containing −NH– groups tendentiously generate a nitrogen-rich
residue because of the intermolecular coupling transesterification
reaction and act either in the gas phase or the condensed phase. When
DMPMP was added to polymers, V-0 ratings were achieved at a low loading
(20 wt % DMPMP for ABS and 10 wt % DMPMP for EVA), indicating that
DMPMP is an efficient and promising FR. These results demonstrated
our above assumption. Moreover, another additional advantage of DMPMP
is that it is a water-insoluble solid. A gas phase is believed to
be at the main FR mechanism for DMPMP and the pendant group CH3–P(O)– in this structure may be responsible
for this action.

diphenyl chlorophosphate, dimethyl methyl phosphonate, methanol, and
1,3-phenylene diamine were purchased from Aldrich, Germany. Thionyl
chloride, triethylamine, chloroform, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 Synthesis of Phosphoramidate
FRs
Two phosphoramidates were synthesized according to the
procedure
presented in the previous report.20 The
chemical structures, full names, and abbreviations of two FRs used
in this work are shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Structure, Full Name, Abbreviations,
and Characteristics of FRs Used in This Study
N-RDP was synthesized by adding a mixture of 1.0 mol
1,3-phenylene
diamine and 2.0 mol triethylamine dissolved in THF to a round-bottom
flask equipped with a temperature controller, a reflux condenser,
and a mechanical stirrer containing 2.0 mol diphenyl chlorophosphate
at 0 °C. The mixture was then allowed to warm up to room temperature
and it was further refluxed for 4–8 h. The Et3N·HCl
salt was removed by filtering, and the filtrate was evaporated to
give a crude product, which was purified by washing three times with
distilled water. The success of the synthesis was confirmed by 1H and 31P NMR analysis. 1H NMR (CDCl3, δ): 7.20–7.10 (m, H–Ar), 6.75–6.74
(HN–Ar); 31P NMR (CDCl3, δ): 30.5
(s).

4N-RDP was synthesized in two steps. The starting material m-phenylene phosphorodichloridate (mPPDC)
was synthesized in our laboratory following the procedure published
in the previous report.20 A mixture of
aniline (1.5 mol) and triethylamine (1.6 mol) in dry THF was placed
in a round-bottom flask equipped with a temperature controller, a
reflux condenser, and a mechanical stirrer. The reaction was maintained
at 0 °C. A solution of mPPDC (0.37 mol) in THF was added dropwise
to the flask over a period of 1 h. The mixture was further refluxed
for 3 h. The precipitated Et3N·HCl salt was filtered
off. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the crude
product was precipitated in water, filtered, and dried under vacuum
overnight to give the final product. 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm): δ 6.90–6.85, 7.30–7.10 (m, H–Ar),
8.45 (m, NH–Ar). 31P NMR (CDCl3, ppm):
δ −1.56 (s).

4.2.2 Synthesis of a Novel
Phosphonamidate FR:
DMPMP
We synthesized a novel P–N FR whose structure
is presented in Scheme 1. First, MPDC was synthesized by following the procedure published
in the previous report.27 MPDC (133 g,
1.0 mol) was dissolved in diethyl ether (ether) in a round-bottom
flask equipped with a temperature controller, reflux condenser, and
a stirrer, which was maintained at 0–5 °C. Solutions of
methanol (32.0 g, 1.0 mol) and triethylamine (101 g, 1.0 mol) in ether
were separately prepared and added dropwise with stirring. The mixture
was then allowed to warm up to room temperature and refluxed for 4
h at 30 °C. After the reaction, filtering and evaporating the
filtrate gave the crude product, MMPC (80% yield). This product was
used for the next reaction without further purification.

Solutions
of 1,3-phenylene diamine (54.0 g, 0.5 mol) and triethylamine (101
g, 1.0 mol) in dry THF were separately prepared and added dropwise
with stirring to a solution of MMPC (128.5 g, 1.0 mol) in dry THF
at 0–5 °C. After their addition, the mixture was allowed
to warm up to room temperature and refluxed for 6 h. The target material
was insoluble in THF and was subjected to filtration and washed with
distilled water to give the pure product (70% yield).

4.3 Measurements and Sample Preparation
4.3.1 Spectroscopic
Analysis
The FT-IR
spectra were obtained using a Nicolet 300 with KBr pellets. 1H and 31P NMR spectra were analyzed on a Varian Unity
Inova 500NB spectrometer using CDCl3 or DMSO as the solvent
and tetramethylsilane as a reference. The chemical shifts of the 31P NMR spectra are relative to the spectrum of 85% H3PO4 as an external standard.

4.3.2 Thermal
Analysis
TGA was carried
out on a TGA 2050 instrument by heating from room temperature to 650
°C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere.
Differential scanning calorimetry was carried out on a TA2910 instrument
under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.

4.3.3 UL-94 Preparation and Measurement
A mixture
of the synthesized FR with the polymer with the designated
composition was processed in a HAAKE PolyDrive mixer at 60 rpm for
7 min at 230 °C and 40 rpm for 7 min at 160 °C for ABS and
EVA, respectively. The fire retardancy performance was evaluated according
to the testing procedure of FMVSS 302/ZSO 3975 with test specimen
bars 127 mm in length, 13.0 mm in width, and 3.2 mm in thickness.
