Material
with special wettability for oil/water separation has
drawn more and more attention, since the oil spill accidents and industrial
processing are growing in frequency and in volume. A superhydrophilic
and underwater superoleophobic mesh was prepared by introducing Co3O4 on a stainless steel mesh, through a simple
hydrothermal process and subsequent calcination. The as-prepared Co3O4 mesh can not only separate various oil/water
mixtures with high efficiency and high flux, but also work effectively
in harsh environment such as highly acidic, alkaline, and salty solutions.
Moreover, the Co3O4 mesh can still retain good
separation performance after 40 abrasion cycles with sandpaper. The
outstanding anticorrosion and antiabrasion behaviors make the Co3O4 mesh promising for oil/water separation even
in harsh environment.

1 Introduction
In the past decades, more
and more oily wastewater is generated
from industrial processing and frequent oil spill accidents, causing
tremendous damages to the social and economic activities, as well
as the ecological environment.1 To make
things worse, the oily wastewater is normally highly acidic, alkaline,
and salty solutions, these harsh environment conditions present more
challenges for the oil/water separation.2 Traditional technologies such as coagulation, oil-absorbing materials,
and air flocculation are limited by low separation efficiency and
huge operation cost.3,4 Thus, how to effectively perform
oil/water separation in harsh environment has attracted broad attention.5−7

A novel strategy that utilizes special wettable materials
to separate
oil/water mixture is considered as efficient and low cost.8,9 According to their different affinities toward water and oil, this
kind of materials can be classified into hydrophobic and oleophilic
(oil-removing), or hydrophilic and oleophobic (water-removing).10 The hydrophobic and oleophilic materials cause
oil to spread, be absorbed, or pass through them while blocking water
penetration, thus they are more easily fouled by oil, showing poor
recyclability. Conversely, the hydrophilic and oleophobic materials,
especially the hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic, allow water
to filter through and repel oil. So, they have better oil resistance
and become more feasible in dealing with large-scale oil/water separation.11,12 The first reported superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic
polyacrylamide hydrogel-coated mesh by Jiang can efficiently separate
oil/water mixtures and be fully recyclable at the same time.13

Up to now, multiple methods have been
developed to fabricate hydrophilic
and underwater oleophobic coating, such as lithography,14 laser processing,15 spray deposition,16 sol–gel processes,17 electrospinning,18 and hydrothermal method.19 Especially
for the hydrothermal method, the products are commonly of high purity
and uniformly dispersed. Moreover, the morphology of the products
can be well controlled.20 Since the surface
chemical compositions and surface architectures are crucial to the
superwetting behavior,21 these advantages
make hydrothermal method an effective technique to create special
wettable materials. For example, Wang et al. prepared an underwater
superoleophobic TiO2 coating with a flower-like structure
on the fluorine doped tin oxide glass substrate through hydrothermal
method.22 To increase the surface roughness,
many other inorganics such as ZnO,23 CaCO3,24 Cu(OH)2,4 and graphene oxide25 have also been widely used. They can promote the wettability according
to the Wenzel model,26 and further enhance
the hydrophilicity due to their high surface energy.27 However, most of these materials are only reported to be
effective in gentle environment, there are few studies on their separation
performance in harsh environment. In practical applications, the components
of oily wastewater are complex, thus the separation materials need
to have good stability over a wide pH range and high mechanical durability
to deal with the possible abrasion. Besides, a facile route for the
fabrication of these materials can make them more promising in practical
oil/water separation.28−30

Co3O4 has attracted much
interest due to
the excellent physical and chemical properties, thus exhibiting well
tolerance toward corrosive solutions.31 Herein, we propose a Co3O4-coated stainless
steel mesh for effective oil/water separation in harsh environment.
In this study, a high-flux and robust mesh was prepared by introducing
Co3O4 onto a stainless steel mesh via a simple
and cost-efficient method. The prepared Co3O4 mesh showed excellent hydrophilicity and oil repellency under water,
which can separate various oil/water mixtures with high efficiency
(>99.4%) and high flux (>75 000 L·m–2·h–1). Additionally, the Co3O4 mesh can still retain good separation performance not only
in corrosive liquids such as acidic, alkaline, and salty solutions
but also after sandpaper abrasion, exhibiting outstanding chemical
and mechanical durability.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of the Co3O4 Mesh
The stainless steel mesh has been
widely chosen as a high-performance substrate for the oil/water separation
because of its mechanical strength, high filtration flux, and reactive
metal surface.32 In this study, a facile
hydrothermal method was used to prepare the Co3O4 mesh. The cleaned stainless steel mesh was put into an autoclave
containing Co(NO3)2 and H2NCONH2 solution. After the hydrothermal reaction, the mesh became
pink due to the formation of cobalt precursors. Then, the sample transformed
into the black Co3O4 mesh after calcination.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared mesh are shown
in Figure 1. The peaks
can be observed at 2θ values of 19.03, 31.32, 36.90, 59.45,
and 65.34°, corresponding to the reflections of (111), (220),
(311), (511), and (440) crystalline planes of Co3O4, respectively, which indicate the formation of Co3O4. Besides, additional peaks at 43.58, 50.72, and 74.56°
are a result of the original stainless steel mesh.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the Co3O4 mesh and original
mesh (red triangle down solid represents diffraction peaks of Co3O4).

Figure 2b–h
displays scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the Co3O4 mesh at different hydrothermal reaction time. As can
be seen in Figure 2a, the original stainless steel mesh exhibits a smooth surface. After
1 h of hydrothermal reaction and following calcination, some needle-like
Co3O4 was deposited on the surface. With the
increase of reaction time, the needles became denser, and some sheets
started to grow on them. These needles were covered with a layer of
uniform Co3O4 sheets at 6 h, and the sheets
started to fall out with further increase in reaction time. As shown
in Figure 2e, the length
of the Co3O4 sheets was 2–4 μm
and grew vertically on the surface of the Co3O4 needle. A low-magnification image of the Co3O4 mesh shows that this unique structure of Co3O4 can be well loaded on the stainless steel mesh without blocking
its original pore.

h. Inset shows the magnification of the as-prepared mesh.

Generally, the methods to obtain special wettable
materials are
time-consuming and complicated, requiring multiple processes and special
treatment.20,33,34 Compared with the previous study, our two-step fabrication is facile
and cost-effective without special instruments and complex treatment.
In addition, the stainless steel mesh and reagents used are all commercial
and easy to obtain. More importantly, we avoided using fluorine-containing
reagents, which are toxic and common in the preparation of special
wettable materials.35,36

2.2 Wetting
Behavior and Separation Performance
of the Co3O4 Mesh
The wettability of
solid surface plays a critical role in separating the oil/water mixture.37 The optical images of water and 1,2-dichloroethane
droplets (5 μL) on the original stainless steel mesh and Co3O4 mesh are shown in Figure 3. The original mesh shows a water contact
angle (WCA) of 126.86 ± 1.56° and an underwater oil contact
angle (OCA) of 138.45 ± 1.45°, revealing its intrinsic wettability
is hydrophobic in air and oleophobicity under water. After covering
the Co3O4 layer, the mesh became superhydrophilic
and showed enhanced underwater oleophobicity. Water can spread quickly
on the Co3O4 mesh and the underwater OCA reached
up to 151.19 ± 0.19°, realizing superoleophobic under water.
As shown in Figure 4, the Co3O4 mesh also showed low oil adhesion
for other kinds of oil (petroleum ether, cyclohexane, and hexane).
This special wettability of the Co3O4 mesh is
due to its surface chemistry and unique morphology. Due to the high
surface energy of Co3O4,38 water would be locked in the nanostructure, form a water
membrane on the surface, thus providing a repulsive force to oil phase,
and prevent oil from permeating through.

Figure 3 Photographs of water
and oil under water (5 μL) on the surface
of (a), (c) the original mesh and the (b), (d) Co3O4 mesh.

Figure 4 Underwater OCAs of various
oils on the Co3O4 mesh.

Next the Co3O4 mesh was applied to
separate
immiscible oil/water mixtures; the separation was conducted in a home-made
setup, which is shown in Figure 5. When petroleum ether (dyed with oil red O) and water
(dyed with methylene blue) mixture was poured onto the prewetted mesh,
water can pass through the mesh quickly just driven by gravity, whereas
the oil was rejected on the mesh surface and collected in the upper
tube. Because the as-prepared Co3O4 mesh is
superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic, water can pass through
easily, whereas oil would be repelled due to the repulsive force provided
by the water trapped in its surface. No obvious oil droplets can be
observed in the collected water, indicating the Co3O4 mesh can separate the oil/water mixture effectively. Other
oil/water mixtures, including cyclohexane and hexane, were also separated
successfully. As shown in Figure 6, the separation efficiencies for different mixtures
could all reach above 99.4%, showing excellent separation performance.

Co3O4 mesh. Optical images (a) before and (b)
after the separation.

Figure 6 Separation efficiencies and fluxes of the Co3O4 mesh for three types of oils.

Besides separation efficiency, flux is also an important
factor
when considering the separation performance. The separation fluxes
of different mixtures were also tested, and the results are shown
in Figure 6. The fluxes
at ordinary pressure of different oils were all above 75 000
L·m–2·h–1, which were
several times higher than those of the reported separation materials.28,39,40 The high flux of the Co3O4 mesh is caused by the hydrophilicity of Co3O4 and the large pore size of the mesh. The Co3O4 mesh is superhydrophilic, so water can spread on the
surface quickly. According to the study by Wang et al., the flux of
membrane is greatly influenced by the pore size. By increasing the
pore size, flux would improve simultaneously.41 Actual situation usually requires a large number of oil/water mixture
to be separated in short time, hence higher flux means better handling
capacity.42

2.3 Chemical
Durability of the Co3O4 Mesh
Figure 7a shows the underwater
OCAs of the Co3O4 mesh after being immersed
into different pH solutions for 24 h.
At pH 1, the OCA is a little lower than 150°, indicating the
Co3O4 mesh may be affected slightly in the strong
acidic condition. For pH ≥ 3, there is little change on OCAs
and the OCAs are all above 150°; hence, the Co3O4 mesh can maintain the underwater superoleophobic property
in most instances. Furthermore, the separation efficiencies of the
Co3O4 mesh under some corrosion environment
are shown in Figure 7b. After being immersed into 1 M HCl, NaOH, and NaCl for 24 h, the
separation efficiencies for petroleum ether are still all above 99.9%.
There is no obvious difference in the efficiency under normal environment
(immersed into deionized water). Loading material with good physical
and chemical stability on the surface is a common way to enhance the
separation material’s anticorrosion performance.7,43 The stainless steel mesh itself has better tolerance toward many
kinds of corrosive solutions. When the stable Co3O4 covered the mesh densely, it further enhanced the chemical
durability. The actual industrial wastewater and the seawater are
often very complex; they may be high-concentration acidic, alkali,
or salty solutions; and these liquids directly contact with the material
during separation. So, outstanding chemical durability of the as-prepared
Co3O4 mesh expands its scope of practical application
in oil/water separation.

being immersed into different pH solutions for 24 h. (b) Separation
efficiencies of the Co3O4 mesh after being immersed

2.4 Mechanical
Durability of the Co3O4 Mesh
It is
still a challenge for many special
wetting surfaces to achieve good mechanical durability.44 The commonly used method to evaluate the mechanical
resistance is the abrasion test.45 The
underwater OCAs were recorded after each abrasion cycle to test the
mechanical durability of the Co3O4 mesh, and
the results are shown in Figure 8a. With the increase of abrasion cycle, the OCAs would
gradually decrease. After 40 cycles, the OCA still maintained at more
than 148°. Many technologies have been used to construct robust
superhydrophilic surfaces, such as adding inorganic adhesives or laser
treatment.15,44 The as-prepared Co3O4 can adhere to the mesh firmly by the hydrothermal process
and the subsequent calcination. The desired mechanical durability
is also attributed to the unique architecture of the twill weave mesh.
Unlike the commonly used plain weave mesh,46−48 only part of
its coating will be worn away when being rubbed. Figure 8b shows the SEM image of the
Co3O4 mesh after 40 abrasion cycles. The remaining
structures still form water membranes to prevent oils. The mechanical
durability of the as-prepared Co3O4 mesh can
deal with the abrasion in daily use and extend its service life.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a Co3O4-coated stainless steel
mesh has been prepared by facile hydrothermal process and subsequent
calcination. The obtained Co3O4 mesh exhibited
excellent hydrophilicity and oil repellency under water. It can separate
various oil/water mixtures with a high efficiency of more than 99.4%
and a high flux of 75 000 L·m–2·h–1, which enables the mesh to be applied in large-scale
oil/water separation under ordinary pressure. Due to the desired chemical
durability, the Co3O4 mesh also showed high
separation efficiency even in highly acidic, alkaline, and salty solutions.
Besides, the mesh also displayed a steady performance after 40 abrasion
cycles with sandpaper, which allows it to avoid mechanical damages.
Facile synthesis and excellent performance make the as-prepared Co3O4 mesh a promising separation material for practical
oil/water separation in various harsh environments, such as the treatment
of marine oil leakage and industrial oily wastewater.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
stainless steel mesh
(type: 316 L material, twill weave and 300 mesh) was purchased from
Guangzhou Ming Wan Screen Mesh Co., Ltd. (China). Co(NO3)2·6H2O, H2NCONH2, acetone, ethanol, HCl (36–38 wt %), and NaOH were all purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). NaCl was purchased
from Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd. (China). All chemical reagents were
analytical grade and used without further purification. All aqueous
solutions were prepared with deionized water.

4.2 Preparation
of Co3O4 Mesh
First, the original stainless-steel
mesh was respectively
cleaned in acetone, ethanol, 1 M HCl, and deionized water for 15 min
and dried at 50 °C. Three millimolar Co(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 60 mL deionized water with
15 mM H2NCONH2 and vigorously stirred for 1
h. Then, the resulting solution was transferred into autoclave and
the cleaned stainless steel mesh was immersed vertically into the
solution. The autoclave was kept at 120 °C for 6 h. When the
temperature cooled down to room temperature, the mesh was washed by
water and ethanol, and followed by dried at 50 °C. Finally, the
obtained mesh was annealed at 300 °C under air for 2 h.

4.3 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction
patterns were collected to confirm the crystal phase of the sample
on a X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV, Japan) with Cu Kα
radiation. The surface morphology was observed by using a scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Sigma, Germany). The values of water
contact angle (WCA) and oil contact angle (OCA) were measured by a
contact angle measuring device (DSA100, Data Physics, Germany) at
room temperature. The oil concentration was tested by UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5000).

4.4 Oil/Water
Separation
The oil/water
separation experiment was conducted by gravity in a filtration apparatus
with a diameter of 25 mm. First, the Co3O4 mesh
was prewetted by water and then placed between two glass tubes. Three
types of oils were used in this separation, including petroleum ether,
cyclohexane, and hexane. The immiscible oil/water mixture (1:1, v/v)
was poured slowly onto the Co3O4 mesh. The corresponding
separation efficiency (η) was calculated according to the following
equation 1  where Cf and Co are the oil concentrations of the filtrate
and the original oil/water mixture, respectively. After pouring 20
mL oil onto the mesh, the permeation flux (F) was
determined by calculating the time after collecting 30 mL of water
according to the following equation 2  where V is the volume of
the filtrate, S is the area of the contacted mesh,
and t is the testing time.

4.5 Durability
Tests
The chemical durability
was investigated by immersing the Co3O4 mesh
into various corrosion liquids for 24 h and then measuring the underwater
OCAs. These corrosion liquids included solutions with different pH
(from 1 to 14), strong acidic (1 M HCl), strong alkali (1 M NaOH),
and high concentration salt (1 M NaCl) solutions. Besides, separation
efficiencies of the Co3O4 mesh for 1 M HCl,
NaOH, and NaCl were also tested.

The mechanical durability was
evaluated by measuring the underwater OCAs after several sandpaper
abrasion cycles. The Co3O4 mesh was placed between
a 100 g weight and a silicon carbide sandpaper and then moved 20 cm
in the horizontal direction and returned; the whole process was defined
as 1 abrasion cycle.
