The influences of static and pore-flowing
procedures on the surface
modification of a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) ultrafiltration membrane
through chemical reaction and physical coating were investigated in
detail. For chemical modification by ethanolamine, a membrane modified
by the pore-flowing procedure showed a higher flux and different morphology.
The reasons were explained by two effects: the pore-flowing resistance
to the random thermal motion of PAN at high temperatures and different
reaction kinetics related to the reactant concentration profile on
the interface between the membrane and reaction solution and the kinetic
property of the fluid (driving force and miscibility) and reaction
(time and rate). For physical coating modification, a dense and flat
layer via a loose and random layer was formed during the pore-flowing
process and static process, which changed the flux and antifouling
property of the membrane. The membrane prepared by dead-end filtration
showed the best trade-off between the flux and antifouling property.
Overall, the procedure kinetics plays an important role in the optimization
of membrane modification.

1 Introduction
Membrane
fouling during a pressure-driven membrane separation process
could seriously decline both the permeability and selectivity of the
membrane and shorten its lifespan.1,2 Among the different
fouling components, organic fouling has done the greatest damage,
which was mainly caused by the irreversible adsorption of organic
matter. The research showed that the hydrophilic surface could effectively
reduce such irreversible adsorption.3 Surface
modifications, including physical coating and chemical modification,4,5 were widely used to prepare hydrophilic membrane.

The main
advantages of surface modifications lie in their simple
and flexible procedure without changing the property of the membrane
matrix. For example, different modification technologies, such as
physical and chemical modifications, can be integrated to improve
their effect.8−10 Although the hydrophilic membrane can also be prepared
by using amphiphilic copolymers directly during the membrane preparation
process, the multistep synthesis procedure and expensive price weaken
their attraction.6,7

During the surface modification
process, the optimization of the
morphology and chemical composition of the modified layer is the key
to improve the property of the membrane.11−13 Usually, the
difference in the molecular shape of the reactant, the number of functional
groups, or the modification method can produce layers of different
topologies.14−16 Moreover, the reaction direction, such as grafting-from
and grafting-to, can produce modified layers with different grafting
densities, chain lengths, coverages, and thicknesses.17−19 Besides, a regular modified layer is also the basic requirement
for further functionalization of the membrane.20,21

Up to now, many efforts have been devoted to update the membrane
modification with new technologies, such as atom transfer radical
polymerization, fixation of initiator, click chemistry, and so forth.22−24 However, one aspect of the modification that is the process kinetics
has been long ignored. From the point of view of chemical engineering,
the mass transfer and diffusion of reactants play an important role
in the chemical process.25−27 Virtually, their influence has
been reflected in the membrane preparation process, only their importance
is ignored. For example, Sejoubsari et al. proposed a “grafting-through”
method, in which monomers were supplied through the surface by diffusion.28 Also, grafting with the monomer vapor was different
compared with grafting in the solution.29 The interface reaction has been widely used to synthesize the nanofiltration
membrane.30−33 The diffusion of reactant during the interface reaction can significantly
influence the property of the membrane.

During the surface chemical
modification, the reaction rate depends
on the reactant concentration at the interface and the reaction region
is related to the distribution of reactant. Similarly, physical coating
by the polymer, which is a typical surface adsorption process, can
be influenced by the morphology profile of the polymer on the interface.
All of these will be interfered by the flow state of reactant or polymer
in the modification process. That is, the kinetic property of the
modification process could play an important role in tailoring the
property of the modified membrane. To the best of our knowledge, no
such research has been carried out up to now.

A polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) membrane is cheap and popular for various
applications.34−37 Similarly, surface modification is also frequently used to improve
the property of PAN membrane.38,39 Multistep chemical
modifications based on hydrolysis reaction and nucleophilic addition
are also frequently reported.40−42 The coating method is also applied
for PAN modification, including polymer, nanoparticles, and so forth.43−45

In the present study, both chemical modification and physical
coating
were investigated as the representative modification processes for
all types of membranes.42,44 A simple, chemical ethanolamine (ETA) was
chosen to react with nitrile groups of PAN,46,47 which can be replaced by other functional amines in principle. The
static and pore-flowing procedures were applied to compare their modification
difference. It is interesting to find that the process kinetics, such
as flowing, reaction, and adsorption, could influence the morphology
and the performance of the modified membrane. The results provide
new knowledge for the membrane modification process.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Modification by ETA
2.1.1 Static Modification
First, the
modification temperature was optimized. The modification was very
slow at the temperature lower than 70 °C (shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2). Therefore,
the modification temperature was set between 70 and 80 °C. The
influence of time was investigated. The results are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Influence of modification
time on the flux (a) and rejection (b)
of ETA-modified PAN membranes by the static method, using 6% ETA aqueous
solution.

The ETA-modified membrane had
a lower water flux than that of the
pristine PAN membrane. In general, high-temperature treatment should
be beneficial to the radial shrinkage of the membrane matrix, which
will result in a decrease in the pore size and a decrease in the flux.48 Essentially, such phenomenon is related to the
intensified thermal motion of the polymer. In Figure 1, the flux of the modified membrane increased
with the reaction time, which means that the modification is favorable
to improve the flux. The reason should be due to the improved hydrophilicity
after modification. The improved hydrophilicity enables more water
molecules to be adsorbed by the polymer which facilitate the diffusion
of water through the PAN membrane. This is quite popular for the hydrophilic
modification process. Moreover, the adsorbed water may also retard
the thermal motion of PAN somehow. Therefore, these factors caused
increased flux of the membrane after modification.

The rejection
was shown in Figure 1b. After modification, the molecular weight cutoff
(MWCO) of the PAN membrane decreased, which means the modified PAN
membranes have a better selectivity. Within all five membranes, P80/12h-S
has a better comprehensive separation property. Although P80/24h-S
has a higher flux due to the higher modification degree, it shows
a lower selectivity. Moreover, the mechanical property was also measured
(shown in Supporting Information Table
S1). Modification improved the mechanical property of the membrane.
However, 24 h modification caused a slight decrease in the tensile
strength compared with that of 12 h modification. This could be attributed
to a looser packing between original PAN molecules after a higher
modification.

2.1.2 Comparison between Static
Modification and
Pore-Flowing Modification (Self-Weight Driving)
2.1.2.1 Longer Time Modification
According
to the results in the static procedure, 70–80 °C and 12
h were chosen as the optimized conditions. The separation performance
of the modified membranes is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Pure water flux (a) and antifouling properties
(b) of PAN membranes
modified by different procedures.

In Figure 2a, membranes
P70/W and P80/W (modified by pure water) showed a very low flux, whereas
the modified membrane has a higher flux. As explained above, the intensified
thermal motion of the polymer may narrow the pore window of the membrane.
Such effect becomes much obvious at higher temperatures. The increased
water flux of the ETA-modified membrane should be attributed to the
improved hydrophilic property after modification. Both membranes P80/12h-D
and P70/12h-D showed higher flux than that of membranes P80/12h-S
and P70/12h-S, whereas their difference in selectivity is not very
much. That is, PEG20k rejection is 91% for P70/12h-D and 95% for P70/12h-S.
For the membrane modified at 80 °C, the flux difference caused
by two procedures is less than that modified at 70 °C. This could
be related to the intensified thermal motion of PAN chains.

The increased flux for the pore-flowing procedure can be explained
by several reasons. First, the solution flow enhanced its resistance
to the random thermal motion of PAN chains in the pore-flowing procedure,
whereas in the static procedure, PAN chains were in a free state to
respond to the thermal strain. Second, the reaction kinetics was changed
by the flow process, which is related to the reactant concentration,
[R]m, at the interface between the membrane and ETA
solution. This will be explained in detail later. Finally, because
the membrane was fixed by the equipment during the pore-flowing procedure,
it may influence the free movement of PAN chains in the membrane more
or less, although no measurable volume change was observed during
the modification process.

The antifouling properties are shown
in Figure 2b. The flux
recovery ratio (FRR) data of
the modified membrane increased with the temperature were about 80%
(modified at 70 °C) and 90% (modified at 80 °C), much larger
than that of the pristine PAN membrane. This was due to the improved
hydrophilic property or modification degree. Moreover, P80/12h-D and
P80/12h-S and P70/12h-D and P70/12h-S showed the similar FRR and flux
irreversible (Fir) data. Therefore, it means that the pore-flowing
procedure is suitable to prepare the membrane with higher flux and
lower selectivity. The static procedure is just the opposite.

The surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) images of PAN membranes modified at 70 °C were
measured and are shown in Figure 3. The pristine PAN membrane showed a fissure structure
on its surface. Such fissures began to disappear after heat water
treatment, which proved the shrinkage effect caused by the intensified
thermal motion of PAN chains at high temperatures. Although the modified
PAN membranes showed a similar smooth surface in SEM, AFM images provided
a clear difference for two membranes in detail: a random homogeneous
surface for P70/12h-S and a rough but evenly distributed modification
on certain areas for P70/12h-D. Such variation could be explained
by the pore-flowing effect and the different reaction kinetics features
of two procedures, as shown in Scheme 1.

Figure 3 SEM and AFM images of PAN membranes modified at different
conditions:
(a) PAN, (b) P70/W, (c) P70/12h-S, and (d) P70/12h-D.

Scheme 1 Illustration of the Difference in Chemical Modification
during Static
and Pore-Flowing Procedures
First, the pore-flowing effect restraints the movement
of thermal
motion of PAN chains, so they are unable to move freely to release
the thermal strain caused by high temperature as in the static procedure.
This is also the reason for different AFM roughnesses of the membrane.
Second, the reaction process is also different for two procedures
because the reaction rate is related to the concentration of the reactant
at the interface [R]m, in Scheme 1. For static process, [R]m obeyed the physical adsorption principle, which showed the character
of multilayer, whereas for the pore-flowing procedure, the reactant
adsorption was interfered by the shear force caused by the flow. The
ETA molecules weakly adsorbed on the interface could be easily washed
away by the flow. Therefore, a monolayer adsorption was formed. That
is, the reaction is in disadvantage during the pore-flowing process.
Moreover, the diffusion of reactant from the center of the solution
to the interface was also different for two procedures, which could
also influence the reaction process.

Energy-dispersive spectrometer
(EDS) data (mapping scan) of the
modified membranes are shown in Table 1. Because chemical modification only formed a single
monolayer, the atom content on the surface virtually reflected the
modification degree. In Table 1, P70/12h-S showed a higher N, O content than that of P70/12h-D.
This proved our above analysis that the flowing process was unfavorable
for the reaction. It showed stronger selectivity for the reaction
area.

2.1.2.2 Shorter
Time Modification
To
weaken the influence of temperature, the modification process was
further carried out for a shorter time by increasing the ETA concentration.
The results are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Water fluxes (a) and antifouling properties (b) of PAN
membranes
modified at 70 °C by increasing the ETA concentration and decreasing
the time.

The flux change of the modified
membrane is the trade-off between
the modification degree and heat effect. In Figure 4a, for each group, the membrane modified
by the pore-flowing procedure showed a higher flux than that modified
by the static procedure in spite of different modification conditions.
For antifouling property shown in Figure 4b, FRR increased from 40% (membranes: P70/E50-1h-S/D)
to 85% (membrane: P70/E12-6h-S/D), in Figure 7b. Unlike flux, the FRR data are very sensitive
to the hydrophilicity of the membrane or the modification degree.
Thus, it can be thought as the reflection of the modification degree.
In other words, two membranes have the similar modification degree
in each group. Therefore, the results reproved the conclusion that
the pore-flowing procedure tended to produce membrane with larger
flux when the membrane was modified to the similar extent.

As
for P30/E30-3h-D/S, it showed a lower antifouling property and
lower flux compared with those of P70/E12-6h-D/S, which is due to
its lower modification degree (FRR data). On the other side, its FRR
was similar to that of P70/E50-1h-D/S, but it took longer reaction
time, so its flux is lower than the latter.

AFM images are shown
in Figure 5. The membrane
modified by the static procedure through
different reaction conditions showed the similar surface roughness,
whereas the surface roughness increased with the modification degree
(FRR data) for membranes modified by the pore-flowing procedure. As
explained above, the membrane was in a free state during the static
process. Therefore, the morphology has less relationship with the
modification degree. For the pore-flowing procedure, the pore deformation
of the membrane was resisted by the flow of the liquid. Such effect
became much obvious with the prolonged treating time. Moreover, the
surface reaction degree was not all the same for the whole surface
area in the pore-flowing process. That is why the surface morphology
difference of the modified membrane was enlarged with the increased
modification degree.

Figure 5 AFM images of PAN membranes modified at different reaction
times
and ETA concentrations through static and pore-flowing procedures
(driving by self-weight).

Although it is difficult to evaluate the individual contribution
of time or concentration to the modification degree because the above
three groups were modified at different conditions (ETA concentration
and time), we can still make a rough estimate on their difference.
According to reaction kinetics, the modification degree is related
to the reaction rate and reaction time. The reaction rate is in proportion
to the reactant concentration, [R]m, because [R]m is normally much higher than that in the solution due
to the physical adsorption principle. Therefore, the increased [R]m data caused by increasing the solution concentration was
not so large. That is why the membrane modified at 50% ETA but for
a short time still has a low FRR data. This is also in agreement with
our former conclusion. ETA modification is a slow reaction; it needs
higher temperature or longer time.

Finally, the performance
of our modified membranes was compared
with those reports in the literature to give a comprehensive evaluation,
although our main intention is to find an optimized routine. The results
are shown in Table 2.

It can be found
that our membranes show a competitive performance.
There are some very high FRR data in Table 2, which should be attributed to different
experimental conditions because the antifouling property of the membrane
can be influenced by the pH value and ion strength of the solution.
That is, their nascent PAN membrane showed a FRR about 77% for the
BSA solution filtration,52 whereas our
fresh PAN membrane showed only about 28% FRR.

2.1.3 Pore-Flowing Modification by Different Driving
Forces
Because the driven forces could influence both the
flowing kinetics and the reaction kinetics, gas pressure and vacuum
were used to replace the self-weight driving force. Pure ETA was used
to shorten the modification time and reduce the shrinkage effect.
The results are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Water fluxes and antifouling properties of the modified
PAN membranes
by the pore-flowing procedure, driven by N2 gas (a,b) and
by vacuum (c,d).

In Figure 6a,b,
N2 gas pressure was used as a driving force, which was
generated due to the decomposition of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN).57 It could flow through the pore channels of the
PAN membrane wetted with ETA and changed the modification process.
The water flux of the modified membrane increased with the amount
of AIBN, which was in proportion to the pressure of N2,
whereas FRR decreased with the gas amount. High flux and low FRR means
a low modification degree. The result showed that the flowing rate
(in proportion to pressure) of the media can significantly influence
the modification efficiency.

In Figure 6c,d,
water vapor was driven by vacuum through the pore channel because
ETA has a melting temperature of 170 °C. Compared P70/1h-W with
P70/1h-15g, which were prepared under the similar condition except
the flow media, P70/1h-W showed much better performance than P70/1h-15g.
The reason could be related to the different flowing rate and better
miscibility between ETA and water. This result further proved that
the physical–chemical property of the fluid was also important.
Moreover, P70/2h-W showed the best FRR data. This should be attributed
to the property change of the fluid. After a long reaction time, many
ETA molecules were also taken away by vacuum. With the changing fluid
composition, the surface property of the modified membrane was influenced
and its antifouling property was weaken.

In all, the above discussion
reveals that the flowing kinetics
and the physical–chemical property of the fluid have a great
influence on the chemical modification process. Although those conclusion
were mainly drawn from the reaction at high temperatures, which was
interfered by the heat motion of PAN chains, it could be still helpful
for the modification process at room temperature.

2.2 Physical Coating by Static and Pore-Flowing
Procedures
2.2.1 Selection of Polymer
Physical coating
was carried out at room temperature to avoid the interference by temperature.
First, the potentials of three polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),
polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and chitosan (CS), to form a coating
layer were evaluated because they all showed a good antifouling property.58,59 The water flux curves of PAN membranes during the filtration of
the low-concentration solutions via time are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Water flux decay of the PAN membrane during the filtration of PVA,
PVP, and CS solutions with different concentrations (0.5, 0.1, and
0.05%, respectively).

In Figure 7, the
membrane flux decreased quickly during the filtration of polymer solution.
Less than 40 min, the flux becomes stable for PVA and PVP. A slightly
increased flux after 40 min during the filtration of 0.05 and 0.1%
CS solution was caused by the slow degradation of CS in a freshly
made acidic solution at the beginning. The decreased flux was mainly
caused by the physical adsorption of polymer on the membrane surface,
similar to the protein filtration process. Because a low-concentration
solution was tested, the interaction between polymer chains in the
solution can be ignored. When the balance between adsorption and desorption
was reached, the membrane flux became steady. Here, the PVA solution
significantly decreased the membrane flux. The PVP solution had the
smallest influence on the membrane flux. However, its postcross-linking
step required a high temperature.60 The
CS solution showed a moderate influence, so it was chosen for PAN
membrane modification.

2.2.2 Comparison of Different
Physical Coating
Procedures
After dipping the CS-coated PAN membrane into
a NaOH solution, the adsorbed CS layer can be fixed on the surface
of the PAN membrane. Here, three types of CS-coated PAN membranes
were prepared by different procedures. The change in their performance
should be caused by the different features of three procedures. Their
filtration data are shown in Figure 8a. An obvious change can be observed for membranes
modified by different procedures (static adsorption, dead-end flow,
and cross-flow). For three membranes modified with 0.1% CS concentration,
CS0.1-D/C (prepared by cross-flowing filtration) had the highest water
flux and the lowest water recovery flux. CS0.1-D/D (prepared by dead-end
filtration) showed the best balance between the pure water flux and
water recovery flux. CS0.1-S (prepared by static adsorption) showed
the lowest flux and better water recovery flux. Such difference should
be related to the morphology of adsorbed polymer layers on the membrane
surface. Compared with the different CS concentrations, membranes
modified with a higher CS concentration showed a lower water flux.
The reason could be related to the loose CS layer related to the lower
concentration of CS. The rejection data of three membranes are shown
in Figure 8b; CS0.1-D/C
showed the lowest MWCO, which means the smallest pores on the surface.
This could be caused by the entrapping effect of the pores on the
surface during the cross-flow. To further reveal the reason for such
a change, the morphology of the membrane was investigated.

Figure 8 Water flux,
antifouling property (a) and rejection (b) of the modified
PAN membrane by CS solution (CSN-D/S/C,D: N: concentration of CS,
D/S: pore-flowing modification/static treatment, and C,D: cross-flow,
dead-end filtration).

The SEM and AFM images of CS-coated PAN membranes after deposition
are shown in Figure 9. Although the deposition of CS on the membrane surface may change
its morphology of the adsorbed CS layer, its main features should
be still preserved. For the static process, the membrane showed a
homogeneously coated surface. For the membrane prepared by dead-end
filtration, the surface showed a network-like and rough structure
of the CS layer, whereas the membrane prepared by the cross-flowing
procedure showed a mediate rough surface.

Figure 9 SEM and AFM images of
CS-coated PAN membranes by different procedures.

Such difference in the morphology and membrane performance
should
be attributed to the influence of the procedure kinetics during the
physical coating process. The possible reason is illustrated in Scheme 2, which can be explained
according to the different morphology and density of the adsorbed
layer.

Scheme 2 Different Coating Layer Morphologies Caused by Different Modification
Procedures
For the cross-flowing
process, the adsorbed layer was thinner but
denser because only those strongly adsorbed polymers could resist
the shear force caused by the flow. For static adsorption, a loose
and random adsorption structure was formed. Dead-end filtration is
like the transition state of two processes. The surface was less influenced
than the pore channel by the flow. Such difference changed the morphology
and performance on the modified membrane. Moreover, for cross-flowing
filtration, the strong shear force on the surface may cause some CS
molecules strongly adhering on the pore entrance and decreased the
pore size.

Finally, the surface EDS data (mapping scan) are
shown in Table 3.

Table 3 EDS Data of the PAN Membrane Coated
by 0.1% CS through Different Procedures

N K	24.24	23.61	23.29	
O K	5.1	5.74	4.55	
In Table 3, CS0.1-S
showed a higher N, O ratio than that of CS0.1-D/C. CS0.1-D/D had the
lowest N, O ratio. Unlike chemical modification, CS coating formed
a multilayer morphology. The surface atom content reflected the dispersion
of the CS layer on the membrane surface, not the total adsorption
amount of CS on the membrane because those membranes have different
surface coverages of CS. The homogeneous coverage of CS should lead
to high EDS data, such as CS0.1-S. CS0.1-D/D showed a clear difference
between the nonporous area and the entrance of the pore on the membrane
surface. Therefore, its average CS content divided by the total surface
area was the lowest. Moreover, if the surface morphology and the membrane
performance are analyzed together, we can deduce that different areas
of the membrane surface (nonporous area or pore entrance) play different
roles in improving the antifouling property of the membrane.

3 Conclusions
The kinetics of the modification
process has a great influence
on the properties and structure of the modified PAN membrane. For
chemical modification, the membrane was in a free state to correspond
to the stress caused by heat and chemical modification during the
static procedure. During the pore-flowing procedure, the shrinkage
of the membrane can be ameliorated by the pore flow effect. The reaction
process was also influenced by the concentration profile of the reactant
on the interface and the kinetic property of the fluid. For physical
coating modification, static process was favorable to form a loose
and random layer, whereas the pore-flowing procedure was favorable
to form a flat but dense layer on the pore channel. In all, the pore-flowing
procedure can be used to precisely construct the modified surface
and improve the performance of the membrane.

with ETA. After modification, the membrane was taken out and washed
with water to remove the residual ETA. The preparation conditions
and membrane list are shown in Table 4.

4.3 Polymer Coating Modification
The
filtration of polymer solution (0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 w/w %) through
the PAN membrane was carried out by the pore-flowing procedure. The
cross-flowing filtration and dead-end filtration (filtration driven
by vacuum) were applied to form a coating layer on the PAN membrane.
Then, the coated membrane was taken out for the post-treatment. For
the static treatment, the PAN membrane was immersed into a polymer
solution for the same time as the filtration process.

For the
post-treatment, the CS-coated membranes were immersed into 1% NaOH
solution for half an hour. Because CS is insoluble in alkaline solution,
it will deposit and form a fixed layer on the surface of the PAN membrane.

4.4 Characterization of the Membrane
Dynamic
contact angle was measured by a contact angle analyzer (JC2000D1,
Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technology Apparatus Co. Ltd., China).
A water droplet of 0.2 mL was transferred from a needle tip onto the
membrane surface. The machine was coupled with a camera, enabling
image capture at 10 frames/s. A series of images were captured at
a constant time rate to measure the contact angle. SEM was measured
by JSM-5600LV (JEOL Co., Japan). The instrument uses an electron beam
accelerated at 3 kV. To obtain the cross section, a dry membrane was
immersed in liquid nitrogen and fractured and the fractured surface
sputtered with a thin layer of gold prior to SEM analysis. EDS mapping
scan was measured by QUANTAX 400-30 installed on SEM. The distribution
and relative proportion (intensity) of elements over SEM image were
mapped. The surface roughness was investigated by AFM (NanoScope IIIa
MultiMode, USA) in a scan size of 500 × 500 nm by the tapping
mode. 256 scans were taken per image. The surface roughness parameters
were reflected in terms of the average roughness (Ra) and the root-mean-square
roughness.

4.5 Membrane Filtration
A self-made cross-flowing
cell (an effective area of 28.26 cm2) was adopted to evaluate
the flux (J) and rejection (R) of
PAN membranes. The PAN membranes were prepressured at 0.1 MPa with
pure water for 0.5 h at 25 °C before all of the measurements.
The pure water flux was calculated by eq 1 1  where J is the membrane flux
(L/m2·h·bar), Q is the volume
of permeated water (L), A is the membrane area (m2), and t is the permeation time (h).

The rejection of the membrane was measured by the filtration of 0.3
g/L dextran (different molecular weights) solution. The dextran concentrations
were measured by a total organic carbon analyzer (TNM-1, Shimadzu),
and the rejection was calculated by eq 2 2  where R is the rejection
ratio and Cf and Cp are the solute concentrations of feed and permeate solutions
(mg/L), respectively. The mean effective pore size distribution was
obtained based on the rejection data, according to the reported method.61

For the antifouling test, pure water was
first passed through the
membrane at least half an hour until the flux remained stable. After
testing the pure water flux (Jw1), water
was replaced by the BSA solutions. The flux was measured again for
3 h with the BSA solution, marked as Jp. Finally, the membrane was cleaned with pure water for 20 min by
cross-flow, and the water flux was measured again, marked as Jw2. The FRR was calculated by the following
expression 3
