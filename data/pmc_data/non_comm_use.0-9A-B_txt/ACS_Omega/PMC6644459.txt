In the present study,
the hydrogen-bonded complexes of azole with water and hydrogen peroxide
are systematically investigated by second-order Møller–Plesset
perturbation theory and density functional theory with dispersion
function calculations. This study suggests that the ability of pyrrolic
nitrogen (NH) atom to function as hydrogen-bond donor increases with
the introduction of nitrogen atoms in the ring, whereas the ability
of pyridinic nitrogen (N) atom to act as hydrogen-bond acceptor reduces
with successive aza substitution in the ring. With introduction of
nitrogen atoms in the ring, the vibrational frequency, stabilization
energy, and electron density in the σ antibonding orbitals of
the X–H (X = N, C of azole) bond of the complexes all increase
or decrease systematically. Decomposition analysis of total stabilization
energy showed that the electrostatic energy term is a dominant attractive
contribution in comparison to induction and dispersion terms in all
of the complexes under study.

1 Introduction
Noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding dictate
the important role in regulating the structure and function of all
biological molecules.1,2 These hydrogen-bonding interactions
are essential in many biologically relevant processes, such as biological
information transfer mechanism by nucleic acids, recognition between
DNA base pairs, ligand-binding to receptor sites, enzyme catalysis,
and α-helix or β-sheet formation.3−8 Strong conventional hydrogen
bonds (HBs) of the type N–H···O play a dominant
role in controlling the conformational preferences of small molecules
as well as complex heterostructures due to their strength and directionality.
On the other hand, weak unconventional C–H···O
interactions become considerable when their collective effect is taken
into account.

Among various biological active compounds, azoles
are an important class of nitrogen-containing five-membered heterocyclic
compounds that are gaining much more attention in the field of medicinal
chemistry. These molecules possess conventional N–H and unconventional
C–H hydrogen bond (HB) donor. Pyrrole (PYR) unit appears in
a large number of pharmaceutical agents and natural products.9 Furthermore, they fabricate the structure of
porphyrin rings, which serve as a key moiety in chlorophyll, heme,
vitamin B12, or bile pigments. Imidazole nucleus constructs the main
structure of some renowned components of human organisms, that is,
amino acid histidine, a component of DNA base structure, and purines,
histamine, and biotin. Imidazole plays an important role in the purification
of histidine-tagged proteins.10 Pyrazoles
exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activities and can surely serve
the purpose to be used as efficient chemotherapeutics.11−17 Triazole (TAZ) and its derivatives possess a variety
of biological properties, including antimicrobial,18 antifungal,19−21 antileishmanial,22 antiviral,23 antitubercular,24 anticancer,25,26 antioxidant,27 anticholinesterase,28 anti-inflammatory,29,30 antidepressant, antianxiety,
and anticonvulsant activities.31

Theoretical studies revealed information about the structure of hydrogen-bonded
complexes and strength of binding interactions. Due to the significant
role of water in biosystem and biological effects of hydrogen peroxide
(HP), hydrogen-bonded complexes of azoles with water and HP have been
extensively studied with computational techniques in the present manuscript.
These complexes convey information about the hydrogen-bonding interaction
in biological systems, in which azoles act as biologically active
scaffold. The capability of azoles to form hydrogen bond is due to
the existence of hydration sites: a pyrrolic nitrogen (NH) that performs
the role of hydrogen-bond donor and a pyridinic nitrogen (N) that
acts as acceptor group. When azoles are exposed to water in a large
number of biological systems, these hydration sites give high solubility
to these compounds.32 The attractiveness
of azoles originates from their application in both supramolecular
and coordination chemistry. The nitrogen-rich azole offers several
N-coordination modes that allow complexation with water and hydrogen
peroxide (HP) through hydrogen bonding. Recent findings suggest that
the biological effects of hydrogen peroxide (HP) are actually mediated
by hydrogen-bonded complexes of HP and molecules of biological interest.
In the last decade, several studies33−37 had been conducted to describe the energetic and structural properties
of hydrogen-bonded complexes of azoles.

This manuscript has
focused attention on the influence of sequential addition of nitrogen
atoms on the hydrogen-bonding ability of azoles with water and HP.
Gas-phase quantum studies reflect that coordination of water/HP molecules
around azoles through N–H···O and/or N···H–O
hydrogen bonds, urging significant changes in the geometrical and
electronic structures of the azole. It is also intriguing to investigate
how both of the intermolecular interactions affect each other through
the aromatic ring.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Stability
and Structural Parameters of Azole–Water/HP Complexes
Pyrrole (PYR), diazole (DAZ), triazole (TAZ), tetrazole (TTAZ), and
pentazole (PTAZ) have been optimized at wB97XD/aug-cc-pVDZ (L1), MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ
(L2), and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ (L3) theoretical
levels (Table 1). As
can be seen from Figure 1, DAZ12 and DAZ13 are two isomeric forms of DAZ with 1,2 and 1,3
positioning of two N atoms, the DAZ13 being 10.18 kcal/mol more stable
than DAZ12 at L3 level. Similarly, TAZ123 and TAZ124 are isomeric
forms of TAZ, with TAZ124 being more stable with respect to TAZ123
and relative energy difference between the two is 15.94 kcal/mol.
Thus, it is observed that DAZ13 and TAZ124 are
more stable relative to their isomeric forms DAZ12 and TAZ123 that
have nitrogen atoms adjacent to each other, which is reasonable. The
hydrogen-bonded complexes of different azoles with water and with
HP in 1:1 ratio have been optimized at all of the three levels mentioned
above and the stabilization energies of all of the studied complexes
are presented in Table 2. The stabilization energies of the complexes were estimated as the
differences in energy between the complex and the sum of the monomers
in their optimized geometries, corrected for basis set superposition
error (BSSE) using the counterpoise (CP) method. Jeffrey proposed
that for weak HBs, stabilization energies lie in the range of 1–4
kcal/mol; for moderate HBs, these energies are 4–15 and 15–40
kcal/mol is for strong HBs.38 Thus, it
is concluded that the HBs in the present study generally fall in “weak”
to almost “moderate” categories. The hydrogen-bonded
complex is more stable in the case of complex having more negative
stabilization energy. In general, all O···H and N···H
HB contact distances are shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii
of two relevant atoms (2.60 Å for the former and 2.74 Å
for the latter). The HB angle X–H···Y usually
tends toward linearity (180°), and closer the angle to 180°,
stronger is the HB. Azole offers two hydration sites toward water/HP:pyrrolic
nitrogen (NH) atom, which can act as HB donor and pyridinic nitrogen
(N), which can act as HB acceptor. Depending on HB donor and acceptor
sites, the hydrogen-bonded complexes of azoles with water/HP have
been placed into five categories
(Figure 2).

In
category I, water and HP are positioned with its lone pair on oxygen
pointing directly toward pyrrolic nitrogen (NH) of azole in azole–water
and azole–HP complexes respectively. These complexes involve
monodentate HB formation with N–H···O interaction.
The azole–water complexes exhibit shorter O···H
bonds and more linear N–H···O bond angles compared
to their counterpart azole–HP complexes, which indicate the
formation of stronger HB in azole–water complexes. The stabilization
energies of azole–water complexes are 0.27–1.05 kcal/mol
higher than those of azole–HP complexes owing to the fact that
the proton acceptor ability of water is marginally higher in comparison
to HP. Experimentally, it was determined that the gas-phase proton
affinity of water (697 kJ/mol) is higher than that of HP (678 kJ/mol),
which clearly shows that water is better proton acceptor than HP.39 The stabilization energies of these complexes
depend on the number and type of additional ring nitrogen atoms. The
order of stabilization energies in these complexes is PYR < DAZ12
< DAZ13 < TAZ124 < TAZ123 < TTAZ < PTAZ; thus, ΔEBSSE systematically enhances with continuous
inclusion of nitrogen atoms in the ring. This supports the fact that
successive aza substitution expedites the tendency of pyrrolic ring
nitrogen (NH) atom to serve as better HB donor. Table 1 reflects that the consecutive addition of
nitrogen atoms in the ring allows the azoles to form progressively
stronger interactions with water/HP molecule. The intermolecular N–H···O
HB distances get shorter with addition of nitrogen atoms and consistently
the stabilization energies get higher. There exists a strong correlation
between stabilization energy and r (N–H···O)
HB distance, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Correlation between hydrogen
bond length r (N–H···O) and
stabilization energy
(ΔEBSSE) at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level.
Series 1 implies the complexes of azole with water. Series 2 implies
the complexes of azole with HP.

In category II, pyridinic nitrogen (N) of azole
is placed with its lone pair facing directly toward hydrogen atom
of water in azole–water and hydrogen of HP in azole–HP
complexes. These complexes involve single HB formation with N···H–O
interaction. The attempts to optimize complexes of HP with azoles
corresponding to category II complexes of azole–water resulted
in complexes of category IV, where in addition to N···H–O
HB, the C–H···OHP HB also forms simultaneously.
Hence, only TTAZ-HPII and PTAZ-HPII could only be optimized. The N···H–O
HB distances in azole–HP complexes are comparatively shorter
in comparison to the corresponding azole–water complexes, resulting
in higher stabilization energies of HPII complexes of TTAZ and PTAZ
relative to their counterpart WII complexes. This is due to the fact
that HP is far better proton donor in comparison to water, illustrated
from the difference in acid dissociation constant (pKa) values of HP (11.6) and water (15.7), which clearly
indicates higher acidity of HP in comparison to water. The results
of stabilization energy reflect that azole–water complexes
are ordered in terms of stability as DAZ13 > TAZ124 > TAZ123
> TTAZ > PTAZ; thus, sequential addition of nitrogen atoms in
the ring leads to significant decrease in ΔEBSSE values. This supports the fact that the tendency
of ring nitrogen atom to function as HB acceptor reduces with the
introduction of nitrogen atoms in the ring. As displayed by structural
parameters, the N···H–O HB length increases
with increase in the number of nitrogen atoms in the ring, which indicates
the fact that as the aza substitution increases, the aforementioned
HB becomes more longer and thus gets more weaker. The stabilization
energy linearly decreases with increase in r (N···H–O)
distance shown in Figure 4. The WII complexes (N···H–O bonded)
are 0.44–6.10 kcal/mol less stable in comparison to their corresponding
WI complexes (N–H···O bonded) except DAZ13,
which reflect that proton donor ability of pyrrolic nitrogen (NH)
of azole toward water is higher than that of proton acceptor ability
of pyridinic nitrogen. The complex PTAZ-WII is 0.49 kcal/mol more
stabilized than PTAZ-WII′, signifying that less stability is
gained when pyrrole-type nitrogen (NH) is placed in an adjacent position
to pyridinic-type nitrogen (N) as in the case of PTAZ-WII′.

Figure 4 Correlation between hydrogen-bond
length r (N···H–O) and stabilization
energy (ΔEBSSE) at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ
level. Series 1 implies
the complexes of azole with water. Series 2 implies the complexes
of azole with HP.

In category III, water/HP molecules are oriented to interact simultaneously
with two hydration sites, leading to the formation of five- and six-membered
hydrogen-bonding ring in azole–water and azole–HP complexes,
respectively. In these complexes, water/HP acts as bridge between
pyrrolic (NH) and pyridinic (N) hydration sites that result in the
formation of two HBs N···H–O and N–H···O.
The participation of these two interactions in the complexes leads
to significant deviation from linearity of both HBs. The stabilization
energy of azole–HP complexes is 1.82–3.25 kcal/mol higher
than that of the corresponding azole–water complexes. The N···H–O
interaction is the major contributing interaction toward ΔEBSSE of azole–HP complexes. It is observed
that r (N···H–O) values are
0.161–0.423 Å shorter in azole–HP complexes in
relation to azole–water complexes consistent with the fact
that HP is a far better HB donor than water. The complexes of category
III are more stable in comparison to their corresponding complexes
of categories I and II since the interaction with two hydration sites
(pyrrolic and pyridinic) forms stronger hydrogen-bond network and
gain more stability in terms of stabilization energy in complexes
of category III.

In category IV complexes, azoles form strong
binary hydrogen-bonded complexes, in which water/HP acts not only
as HB donor toward pyridinic nitrogen (N) but also as HB acceptor
toward C–H bond of heterocyclic ring, resulting in the formation
of pseudo-five- and six-membered hydrogen-bonding ring in azole–water
and azole–HP complexes, respectively. The deviation from linearity
of C–H···O and N···H–O
HB angles is due to strain introduced by the hydrogen-bonded ring
structure, as shown in Figure 2. The stabilization energies of these complexes are ordered
in terms of stability as DAZ > TAZ > TTAZ, which further authenticates
the fact that increase of aza substitution in the ring decreases the
hydrogen-bond acceptor ability of ring nitrogen atom. In these complexes,
the N···H–O is the major contributing interaction
in ΔEBSSE in comparison to C–H···O
as proposed by geometrical parameters. The C–H···O
interaction only cooperatively strengthens the hydrogen-bonded system
as a source of secondary stabilization. The complexes of category
IV are less stabilized than category III complexes, as there is one
unconventional C–H···O HB present in the former
complexes.

In category V, water acts as HB acceptor toward C–H
bond of azoles. These complexes involve single C–H···O
HB interaction. The order of stabilization energies in these complexes
is TAZ > DAZ > PYR, consistent with the fact that the hydrogen-bond
donor capability of C–H bond toward oxygen of water increases
with increase in the aza substitution. In these complexes, as the
number of nitrogen atoms in the ring increases, the C–H···O
HB length decreases, which shows that the above-mentioned HB becomes
shorter and thus stronger with increase in the aza substitution. The
C–H···O HB angles in these complexes lie in
the range 169.32–169.89°. The HB angles in complexes of
categories I, II, and V that are stabilized by single HB are more
linear, while the presence of secondary HB in the complexes of categories
III and IV complexes leads to cause sizable deviation from linearity.
The W–V complexes are 4.34–5.51 kcal/mol are less stabilized
than those of their corresponding W–I complexes as it is obvious
that strong conventional N–H HB present in the latter complexes
is better proton donor in comparison to the unconventional C–H
bond in the former.

2.2 Vibrational Properties of Hydrogen-Bond Donor Group
In the
case of HBs N···H–O and N–H···O,
the X–H (proton donor fragment) frequency decreases upon HB
formation and is called red shift, whereas in the case of C–H···O
HB, the frequency increases and this phenomenon is called blue shift.
Red shifting in the vibrational frequencies is expressed as negative
values of Δυ, whereas blue shifting is expressed as positive
Δυ values. The shift in stretching frequency is related
to the elongation and contraction of the X–H bond length in
the cases of red and blue shifts, respectively. A negative value of Δd refers to a bond contraction upon HB formation, and a
positive value refers to a bond elongation. The blue and red shifting
associated with hydrogen bonds have been offered several explanations
in the literature. Alabugin et al. proposed that the competition between
the nY → σ*X–H hyperconjugation
(elongates the X–H bond) and polarization of X–H bond
due to rehybridization (shortens the X–H bond) is the origin
of both red- and blue-shifted HBs.40 Hyperconjugation
and rehybridization have opposite effects on X–H bond, and
their balance will determine red shift or blue shift of the formed
HB. Table 3 displays
the change in HB donor distance (Δd in Å)
and shifts of stretching frequencies (Δυ in cm–1) of the HB donor group upon complex formation relative to monomers
at L2 level. As anticipated for conventional HBs, the HB donor O–H
bond of water/HP and N–H bond of azole consistently undergo
red shifting upon hydrogen bonding. In contrast, HB donor C–H
bond of azole undergoes shortening and its stretching frequency shifts
to the blue region. In fact, larger red shifts have been noted in
O–H stretching frequencies of HP (−89.62 to −407.61
cm–1) in azole–HP complexes relative to that
of water (−63.92 to −231.22 cm–1)
in azole–water complexes, which can be explained on the basis
of the fact that HP is a remarkable proton donor in comparison to
water. In the present study, the higher acidity of O–H bond
of HP relative to that of water is also demonstrated by larger elongation
of O–H bond in azole–HP in comparison to azole–water
complexes. The values of Δd and Δυ
for O–H bond decline systematically upon progressive aza substitution.
Excellent correlation is found to exist between Δd and Δυ for O–H bond of azole–water and
azole–HP complexes shown in Figure 5. Larger red shifts have appeared in N–H
stretching frequencies of azole in azole–water (−81.96
to −321.65 cm–1) complexes relative to that
of azole–HP (−55.93 to −160.67 cm–1) because water is a better proton acceptor in comparison to HP.
The higher acidity of N–H bond of azole toward water relative
to HP is also demonstrated by larger elongation of N–H bond
in azole–water in comparison to azole–HP complexes.
The values of Δd and Δυ for N–H
bond increase systematically with enhancement of aza substitution
in the ring.

A strong correlation is found to exist between
Δd and Δυ for N–H bond of
azole–water and azole–HP complexes shown in Figure 6. In the complexes
of category III, larger red shifts have been observed in the O–H
stretching frequency of water/HP and smaller red shifts appear in
the stretching frequency of N–H bond of azole except PTAZ-HPIII,
which reflect that O–H bond of water/HP acts as a better proton
donor in comparison to N–H bond of azole.

2.3 Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) Analysis
2.3.1 Atomic Charges
The values of atomic charges of atoms forming HB evaluated at L3
level utilizing NBO analysis are presented in Table 4. In the complexes of categories II, III,
and IV, the contiguous nitrogen atoms of DAZ12, TAZ123, and TTAZ influence
the atomic charge on pyridinic nitrogen atom directly involved in
hydrogen bonding and atomic charge reduces with sequential addition
of nitrogen atoms in the ring. In contrast, DAZ13 and TAZ124 complexes
of the above-mentioned category in which nitrogen involved in hydrogen
bonding is adjacent to carbon atom favor a strong electrostatic component
in comparison to complexes of DAZ12, TAZ123, and TTAZ. In the complexes
of both I and III categories, the atomic charge on oxygen of water
lies in the range −0.940 to −0.972 au, while this value
on oxygen atom of HP is nearly half, i.e., −0.470 to −0.519
au. This suggests that the electrostatic component is more favored
in interactions, where water is involved as HB acceptor relative to
that of HP. The sequential addition of nitrogen atom in the ring boosts
the atomic charge on hydrogen atom attached to pyrrolic nitrogen (NH)
in category I and III complexes but reduces the atomic charge on hydrogen
atom attached to water/HP in category II and III complexes. The atomic
charge on hydrogen is quite low in W–V complexes involving
only one unconventional C–H···Ow HB
interaction, but high electron density present at oxygen atom of water
reflects that electrostatic interaction still plays significant role.

2.3.2 Charge Transfer
and Second-Order Delocalization Energy [E(2)]
NBO analysis depicted that during the formation of HB,
certain amount of electron density is transferred from proton acceptor
to proton donor and electron density is rearranged. In accordance
with Wang et al., the charge transfer and electrostatic interactions
are responsible for variation in frequency, which also affects the
strength of HB.41Table 4 illustrates the values of charge transfer
(CT) from azole to water/HP for the complexes under study at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ
level. Positive CT values represent that electron density is transferred
from azole to water/HP, and the reverse happens in the case of negative
CT values. The magnitude of CT values in azole–HP complexes
is higher than their respective azole–water complexes. The
CT occurs from water/HP to azole in complexes of category I and V
complexes, as indicated by their negative CT values. Upon progressive
aza substitution in the ring, the azole molecule becomes more acidic
and it becomes a better proton donor and electron acceptor; hence,
the magnitude of charge transfer increases in the above-mentioned
categories, as we move from PYR to PTAZ. The CT occurs from azole
to water/HP in category II and III complexes as CT values come out
to be positive. The magnitude of CT in the above-mentioned categories
reduces with subsequent inclusion of nitrogen atoms in the ring, since
with reduction of nitrogen atoms in the ring, pyridinic nitrogen (N)
atom of azole becomes more basic and hence it becomes better proton
acceptor. The CT values of complexes of categories III and IV involve
HBs, with both azole and water/HP acting as HB donor as well as acceptor;
therefore, charge transfer occurs from azole to water/HP and vice
versa. The CT values of complexes of category III being positive except
PTAZ-HPIII indicate that charge transfer from the azole to water/HP
is higher than that from water/HP to azole, so the direction of net
charge transfer is from azole to water/HP. The relatively lower CT
values in complexes of categories III and IV in comparison to their
counterpart complexes in categories I and II are understandable since
charge transfer arising in two HBs is in the opposite direction in
former categories. The magnitude of CT in category IV complexes is
higher in comparison to that in category III, since in the former
category, one of the interactions involved is unconventional C–H···O,
expected to be weak in nature, hence negligible to small charge transfer
occurring through this interaction and other interaction is mainly
responsible for charge transfer. The variation in charge transfer
in category II, III, and IV complexes suggests that it is favored
by reduction in the number of nitrogen atoms in the ring, whereas
in categories I and V, it is favored by inclusion of nitrogen atoms
in the ring.

The information about electron delocalization is
reflected by the E(2) values, the second-order
perturbation energies associated with the orbital interactions important
for HB formation. The E(2) values for
nO(water) → σ*N–H orbital
interaction are higher in comparison to nO(HP) →
σ*N–H, as observed in category I complexes
due to the fact that water acts as a better proton acceptor compared
to HP. The enhancement in E(2) values
for nO(water/HP) → σ*N–H orbital interactions with continuous addition of nitrogen atoms
in the ring as seen in complexes of category I and III concludes that
additional nitrogen atom in the ring increases the electron density
in the σ* antibonding N–H orbitals that leads to weakening
and elongation of N–H bond and is also in line with concomitant
increase in the red shift of stretching vibration. This statement
is also supported by a good linear correlation between E(2) values and red shift in the N–H stretching
vibration of azole–water and azole–HP complexes shown
in Figure 7. The E(2) values for nN → σ*O–H(HP) orbital interaction are higher relative to nN → σ*O–H(water) orbital interactions
as seen in category II, III, and IV complexes, which is in accordance
with the fact that HP is a far better hydrogen bond donor than water.
The decline in E(2) values for nN → σ*O–H(water/HP) orbital interactions
with consecutive aza substitution in the ring as seen in the complexes
of categories II, III, and IV reflects that additional nitrogen atom
in the ring decreases the electron density shift from lone pair of
pyridinic nitrogen (N) to the σ* antibonding O–H orbital
of water/HP and is also in line with concomitant decrease of red shift
in O–H stretching vibration upon progressive aza substitution
in the ring. The nN → σ*O–H orbital interactions in category WII complexes are 18.07–87.63%
lower than nO → σ*N–H orbital
interaction in the corresponding complexes of category WI, and this
percentage stability progressively reduces with sequential introduction
of nitrogen atoms in the ring. The higher magnitude of nO → σ*N–H orbital interaction compared
to that of nN → σ*O–H orbital
interaction in WIII complexes except DAZ12-WIII reflects that the
proton donor ability of pyrrolic nitrogen (NH) of azoles toward water
is higher than that of proton acceptor ability of pyridinic nitrogen
(N). The nN → σ*O–H orbital
interaction is stronger than that of nO → σ*N–H orbital interaction in category HPIII complexes,
except PTAZ-HPIII, which reflects that the proton acceptor ability
of pyridinic nitrogen (N) of azoles toward HP is higher than that
of the proton donor ability of pyrrolic nitrogen (NH). The E(2) values for both nO → σ*N–H and nN → σ*O–H orbital interactions are reduced to a larger extent in complexes
of category III in comparison to their counterpart complexes in categories
I and II, which possess sole nO → σ*N–H and nN → σ*O–H charge-transfer
interactions, respectively, indicating the role of alignment of orbitals
in orbital interactions.

2.4 Topological Parameters
The atoms in molecules (AIM)
theory provides an additional tool for detection and characterization
of hydrogen-bonding interactions. The analysis of critical points
appears to be most crucial for studies on interatomic interactions.
Two types of topologically stable critical points are present in the
complexes under study, which are assigned as (3, −1) called
bond critical points (BCPs) and (3, +1) called ring critical points
(RCPs) present in the interior of the ring. AIM analysis has been
used to investigate the properties of HBs in the sense of electron
density properties estimated in the BCPs, while that of π-electron
system, in terms of electron density properties in RCPs. Figure 8 shows the molecular
graphs of complexes of azoles with water/HP. The main topological
properties at the (3, −1) and (3, +1) critical points, such
as electron density (ρc), its Laplacian (∇2ρc), the total electron energy density (Hc), and its two components potential electron
energy density (Vc) and kinetic electron
energy density (Gc) are summarized in Table S21. Several reports in the literature
reflect that ρ is a good index of HB strength; larger ρc at the BCP indicates stronger HB. According to the criteria
of HBs proposed by Koch and Popelier,42 the electron density ρc at the BCPs lies in the
range of 0.002–0.040 au and Laplacian ∇2ρc of the electron density at the BCPs falls in the range of
0.024–0.139 au. The positive values of ∇2ρc imply that interactions are closed-shell such
as ionic interactions, van der Waals interactions, or HBs, whereas
negative value of ∇2ρc indicates
that there is a shared interaction such as covalent bonds. The positive
∇2ρc and the negative Hc mean that the interaction is partly covalent in nature.
The ratio −Gc/Vc has also been used to classify the bonding interaction.
If −Gc/Vc > 1, then the interaction is noncovalent; if 0.5 < Gc/Vc < 1, then
the interaction is partly covalent in nature.

Figure 8 Molecular graphs
of complexes of azoles with water and HP at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level.
The small red balls indicate bond critical points, and the small yellow
balls indicate ring critical points.

In the present
work, the wave functions of hydrogen-bonded molecular geometries obtained
from MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ have been employed to characterize the topological
properties. As seen in Table S21, all of
the HBs in complexes under study satisfy Koch and Popelier’s
criteria with ρc and ∇2ρc of (3, −1) values well in the respective ranges of
0.010–0.036 and 0.047–0.121 au, respectively. The ∇2ρ and Hc values are greater
than zero for all of the interactions; therefore all of the complexes
display the characteristics of closed-shell interaction. This is also
supported by the ratio -Gc/Vc, which is more than 1 for all of the interactions.

In category WI and WIII complexes, ρc and ∇2ρc of (3, −1) values for the HBs involving
N–H···Ow interaction lie in the ranges
of 0.016–0.036 and 0.077–0.113 au, respectively. In
category HPI and HPIII complexes, ρc and ∇2ρc of (3, −1) values for the HBs involving
N–H···OHP interaction lie in the
ranges of 0.017–0.026 and 0.078–0.107 au, respectively.
The higher ρc and ∇2ρc values for N–H···Ow interaction
compared to N–H···OHP in these complexes
can be rationalized on the basis of better HB acceptor ability of
water than HP. The uptrend in ρc and ∇2ρc values for the HBs involving N–H···O
interaction with incorporation of nitrogen atoms in the ring in these
complexes is consistent with the fact that successive aza substitution
in the ring boosts the tendency of ring nitrogen atom to play the
role of HB donor.

In category WII, WIII, and WIV complexes,
ρc and ∇2ρc of
(3, −1) values for the HBs involving N···H–Ow interaction lie in ranges of 0.010–0.028 and 0.047–0.109
au, respectively. In category HPII, HPIII, and HPIV complexes, ρc and ∇2ρc of (3, −1)
values for the HBs involving N···H–OHP interaction lie in the ranges of 0.020–0.035 and 0.072–0.121
au, respectively. The ρc and ∇2ρc values for N···H–OHP interaction are higher compared to N···H–Ow in these complexes, which can be justified in terms of significantly
better proton donor ability of HP compared to that of water. The downtrend
in ρc and ∇2ρc values for HBs involving N···H–O interaction
upon progressive aza substitution in the ring ensures the fact that
the tendency of ring nitrogen atom to play the role of HB acceptor
reduces with increase in the aza substitution.

In all of these
complexes, the (3, +1) values of ρc and ∇2ρc follow the order PTAZ > TTAZ > TAZ
> DAZ > PYR, which clearly shows that as the aza substitution
increases, the value of ring critical point (RCP) increases.

2.5 Molecular Electrostatic Potential
(MEP)
Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is helpful
in understanding the electrophilic and nucleophilic regions present
in the molecule. Figure 9 depicts the contour maps of MEP of azoles, where the red and blue
regions indicate positive and negative MEP regions, respectively.
The most negative-valued points in the MEP topography, usually recognized
with the notation Vmin, is widely used
to gauze the electron-rich site of the molecule, while the most positive-valued
points denoted by Vmax is used to indicate
the electron-deficient site of the molecule.

Figure 9 Molecular electrostatic
potential of azoles. The black
circles represent the position of Vmax (in kcal/mol), and the blue circles represent the position of Vmin (in kcal/mol) at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level.

As evident from
the MEP of azoles, the strong negative electrostatic potentials associated
with ring pyridinic nitrogen atom make these sites attractive for
electrophiles. The magnitude of these negative potentials Vmin reduces with addition of nitrogen atoms
in the ring, which reflects the fact that more nitrogens compete for
polarizable electronic charge and each receives a small share of it.
The strong positive electrostatic potentials Vmax along the N–H bond vector of azole make these sites
attractive for nucleophiles. The very electronegative heteroatom nitrogen
withdraws electron density from the aromatic heterocycle. With increasing
number of nitrogen atoms in the ring, the π electron density
in the ring decreases and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP)
becomes more positive. The magnitude of these positive electrostatic
potentials expedites with introduction of nitrogens in the ring.

The electronic changes during the HB formation can be clearly understood
by comparing Vmin values of isolated azoles
with Vmin values of azoles in the complex
(designated as V′min). Hence, the
electronic reorganization during the HB formation can be gauzed as
ΔVmin = V′min – Vmin, and these MEP
parameters are summarized in Table 5. It is to be anticipated from Vmin values that upon coordination of azole with water/HP, there
is large decrease in negative lone pair potentials of pyridinic nitrogen
atom in the case of complexes involving single N···H–O
interaction, whereas increase is observed in the negative lone pair
potential of ring nitrogens in the case of complexes involving single
N–H···O interaction. The category II, III, and
IV complexes have a positive value of ΔVmin, which indicates that the amount of negative lone pair
is transferred from azole ring to water/HP during the formation of
complex. The category I and IV complexes have a negative value of
ΔVmin, which indicates the gain
in negative lone pair potential by azole at the expense of water molecule
during the formation of complex.

2.6 Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) Analysis
To get more insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions,
symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) offers the advantage to
decompose the stabilization energy into components like electrostatic
(Eels), induced (Eind), dispersion (Edisp), exchange
(Eexch) interactions, etc. The Eels, Eind, and Edisp components are attractive energy terms
stabilizing the complexes, whereas the Eexch component is repulsive. When all energy terms are put together,
we obtain the total SAPT energy. Table 6 shows that the order of SAPT energies in each category
is the same as that of BSSE-corrected stabilization energy at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ
basis set. The major attractive force in all of these complexes is
the electrostatic interaction, with its contribution being large compared
to the corresponding contribution from induction and dispersion. The
absolute value of the electrostatic term increases with increasing
number of nitrogen atoms in all of the complexes under study. A larger
value of this term correlates with more positive molecular electrostatic
potential of heterocyclic compound with more nitrogen atoms. Generally,
all energy components increase with increasing number of nitrogen
atoms in the heterocycle. In category I, a larger value of electrostatic
term in azole–water complexes in comparison to azole–HP
is in agreement with more positive molecular electrostatic potential
associated with former complexes while in category II, III and IV,
the situation is opposite and is also in accordance with more positive
electrostatic potential associated with azole–HP in comparison
to azole–water complexes. A larger value of electrostatic term
is associated with the complexes where both pyrrolic and pyridinic
hydration sites are involved in hydrogen bonding as in category III
in comparison to the complexes, where only pyrrolic hydration site
is involved as in category I. This is also consistent with more positive
electrostatic potential associated with category III complexes in
comparison to category I. The larger role of induction term relative
to dispersion term is observed in red-shifted hydrogen-bonded complexes
as in categories I, II, and III, while the reverse happens in blue-shifted
hydrogen-bonded complexes as in category V.

In the complexes
of category I, the electrostatic potential contributes 60.19–65.09%
in azole–water complexes, while it accounts for 58.29–62.19%
of total attractive interaction in azole–HP complexes and thus
the percentage stability due to electrostatic interaction is higher
in azole–water complexes in comparison to their counterpart
azole–HP complexes. It is worth noting that the percentage
contribution of the electrostatic component reduces with introduction
of nitrogen atoms in the ring. In the above-mentioned category, the
percentage contribution of the Edisp component
is higher in azole–water complexes compared to azole–HP
complexes, and it is observed that the dispersion component seems
to increase the red shift of N–H bond in azole–water
complexes compared to azole–HP complexes. It is our opinion
that this is due to the intensified orbital overlap and consequently
more efficient antibonding donation to σ* orbitals of N–H
bond in azole–water complexes.

3 Conclusions
A comparative study on
azole–water and azole–HP hydrogen-bonded complexes has
been performed with the aid of MP2 and density functional theory with
dispersion function (DFT-D) calculations. The ΔEBSSE values for azole–water complexes fall in the
range of −0.69 to −9.93 kcal/mol, while for azole–HP
complexes, the range is −4.80 to −12.06 kcal/mol at
MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level. By analyzing the geometries, vibrational frequency,
natural bond orbitals, stabilization energies, and MEP and SAPT calculations,
we conclude the following remarks:1. The HB interactions N···H–OHP are found to be more stronger compared to N···H–Owater interactions, while N–H···OHP are weaker in magnitude than N–H···Owater. This is due to the fact that HP is a better proton donor
and water a better proton acceptor.

2. The HB donor ability of pyrrolic nitrogen (NH) atom
of azole increases in the order as PYR < DAZ < TAZ < TTAZ
< PTAZ, which reflects that successive aza substitution expedites
the tendency of pyrrolic nitrogen (NH) to serve as better HB donor.

3. The HB acceptor ability
of pyridinic nitrogen (N) atom of azole increases in the order PTAZ
< TTAZ < TAZ < DAZ, which supports that the tendency of pyridinic
nitrogen to function as HB acceptor reduces with successive addition
of nitrogen atoms.

4. The
complexes where both hydration sites (pyrrolic and pyridinic) are
involved in hydrogen bonding gain more stability in comparison to
the complexes, in which only single hydration site is involved.

5. Vibration analysis reflects
that the magnitude of red shift in the stretching frequency of N–H
bond of azole upon complexation with water (−81.96 to −321.65
cm–1) is magnificently higher compared to that of
complexation with HP (−55.93 to −149.49 cm–1), since water is better HB acceptor compared to HP and has been
explained on the basis of difference in acidity of water and HP. The
increment in the red shift of N–H stretching vibration of azole
in the complexes involving nO(water/HP) → σ*N–H orbital interactions with continuous addition of
nitrogen atoms in the ring concludes that additional nitrogen atom
enhances the orbital overlap and thus more efficient antibonding donation
to σ* orbitals of N–H that leads to elongation of N–H
bond.

6. A significantly
higher magnitude of red shift in the stretching frequency of O–HHP bond (−89.62 to −407.61 cm–1) in azole–HP complexes compared to that of O–Hwater bond (−47.96 to −231.22 cm–1) in azole–water complexes has been observed, which is due
to the fact that HP is better HB donor than water. The decrement in
the red shift of O–H stretching vibration of water/HP in the
complexes involving nN → σ*O–H(water/HP) orbital interactions with introduction of nitrogen atoms in the
ring reflects that additional nitrogen atoms decrease the orbital
overlap and thus inefficient antibonding donation to σ* orbitals
of O–H upon progressive aza substitution in the ring.

7. SAPT analysis reflects
that the electrostatic energy term is a dominant attractive contribution
in comparison to induction and dispersion terms in all of the hydrogen-bonded
complexes under study. Generally, all energy components increase with
the introduction of nitrogen atoms in the ring. This study also reflects
that the induction term is larger than the dispersion term in red-shifted
hydrogen-bonded complexes as in categories I, II, and III, while the
reverse situation happens in blue-shifted complexes as in category
V.



4 Computational Methods
The geometries of azoles and their
corresponding hydrogen-bonded complexes with water and HP were optimized
by employing second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation
(MP2) level in combination with aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis
sets. For comparison purpose, the DFT-D method utilizing wB97XD level
was also used in conjunction with aug-cc-pVDZ basis set.43−45 All of the calculations of azole–water
and azole–HP complexes were carried out using Gaussian 09 software.46 During the optimization, no constraints were
imposed on the molecular geometries of the complexes of azole with
water/HP. Frequency calculations were performed at the same level
to corroborate that the obtained structures correspond to energy minima.
In complex, one monomer may compensate for the incompleteness of the
basis set using the basis function of another monomer, thus lowering
its energy, and the strength of the HB is overestimated. This is known
as basis set superposition error (BSSE). The stabilization energies
of azole complexes included basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrections,
which were employed by the counterpoise (CP) method of Boys and Bernardi.47 The
BSSE can be measured as the difference between monomer energies with
the regular basis set and the full basis functions for the complex.
The stabilization energy (ΔEBSSE) is given by  where EX(Y) is the energy of the subscript fragment X calculated in the basis
of unit Y (X = Y or X ⊂ Y); EA0 and EB0 are the energies
of the fragments A and B, respectively, in their actual geometries
within the complex; and EA(A) and EB(B) are the energies of the free fragments
in their equilibrium geometries. The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis
has been performed to obtain charge-transfer interactions, atomic
charges, and E(2) values at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ
within the Gaussian 09 package.48 The lone
pair on hydrogen-bond acceptor interacts with the antibonding orbital
of hydrogen-bond donor to give rise to the second-order delocalization
[E(2)], which is given by  where ΔEij is the energy difference between interacting orbitals and Fij is the Fock matrix elements. The electron
density properties at bond critical points (BCPs) and ring critical
points (RCPs) of azole–water and azole–HP complexes
have been analyzed by employing the AIMALL program.49,50 The
molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) was calculated using WFA surface
analysis suite.51,52 The total stabilization energy
was decomposed by using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT)
at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level with the use of GAMESS package linked to
the SAPT 2012.2 code.53−55
