The complexation and selectivity of N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)-diglycolamic acid (HDEHDGA/kerosene,
HA) toward the light lanthanides, La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), and Nd(III),
are presented for the extraction from chloride media. In the low pH
region (pH 1.8–2.8), the obtained data reveal that the extraction
of Ln(III) is governed by cation-exchange mechanism and is driven
by the negative change in enthalpy. The results from the slope analysis
method suggest the formation of LnA3·(HA)1or2 in the extraction process. As major extracted species with a core of LnA3 in the
first coordination sphere, LnA3 might connect with one
or two additional HA molecules in the second coordination sphere by
hydrogen bonding. The LnA3 core might share similar coordination
geometry to those of 1:3 Ln(III) complexes (LnA′3) with water-soluble N,N-dimethyl-diglycolamic
acid (HDMDGA, HA′) formed in aqueous solutions or in solid-state
compounds. The correlation between the extraction with HDEHDGA (HA)
as an extractant and the complexation with HDMDGA (HA′) as
a chelator has been explored by interpreting the separation factors
for HA with the difference in the stability constants for HA′.
Consequently, the ratios of the stability constants of the corresponding
1:3 complexes (LnA′3) with HDMDGA could be reasonably
translated to the separation factors (SFs) with HDEHDGA, providing
a valuable approach for understanding the origin of the extraction/separation
mechanism. By comparing the extraction selectivity of HDEHDGA with
that of the currently deployed extractants in the industry such as
P204, P507, and Cyanex 272, HDEHDGA offers outstanding selectivity
with considerable SFs (SFCe/La = 6.68, SFPr/Ce = 2.79, and SFNd/Pr = 2.65) for light Ln(III) pairs under
conditions of low acid concentrations.

Introduction
Rare earth elements, including 15 lanthanides
(Lns) as well as
scandium and yttrium, are of great economic importance because of
their extensive applications in various industries such as catalysis,
metallurgy, ceramics, medicine, display screens, laser technology,
and electronics.1−3 In last few decades, the extraction/separation of
rare earths (REs) has attracted great attention due to their potential
industrial and economical significance in addition to the increased
demands of REs of high purity. Liquid–liquid extraction is
a well-accepted supreme technique for the separation and purification
of REs for commercial production.4−6 Besides, extraction processes
for the separation of lanthanides from high-level waste in the nuclear
industry have also been developed because the light lanthanides are
considered one of the major constituents in the fission products in
spent nuclear fuel. The functional groups of a given extractant play
a critical role in the extraction/purification processes of REs. Based
on the functional groups, extractants are mainly sorted as acidic,
neutral, and basic that could be employed for the extraction of REs
in the research and industrial fields with several proposed mechanisms
as discussed earlier.7−15 Among these extractants, hydrophobic organophosphorus acidic extractants
have been studied with more efforts. One of the most important properties
of those acidic extractants is their tunable extraction ability to
the desired metal ions, which could be achieved by simply adjusting
the pH of the aqueous phase solutions. Although organophosphorus extractants
are considered effective ligands for RE extraction, they do have some
certain drawbacks such as leaving behind phosphorus residues as byproducts
and exhibiting low selectivity in the case of intragroup separation
of REs.16−18 Moreover, P507 and naphthenic acid have been found
ineffective to separate REs from sulfate media due to emulsion formation.19 Also, the low selectivity of Cyanex 921 and
the multistage stripping operations required for Cyanex 923 are considered
as common drawbacks that may limit their uses in the industry.20 To overcome these drawbacks, a lot of efforts
have been made to develop extractants that are structurally different
from the bidentate organophosphorus acids and the neutral organophosphorus
extractants.21−25 Among those ligands, tetraalkyl-diglycolamides (TRDGAs) have been
studied due to their high affinity for trivalent lanthanides. Table 1 summarizes the extraction
of Ln(III) from different systems using carboxylic acids and amide-based
extractants. The TRDGAs exhibit very good extraction ability for the
trivalent lanthanides Ln(III) and actinides An(III) from high-level
liquid waste as compared to other ligands such as n-octylphenyl-N,N-diisobutyl carbamoylmethyl
phosphine oxide, trialkylphosphine oxides, di-isodecyl phosphoric
acid, and malonamide-based ligands.26,27 The potential
extractability of TRDGAs is ascribed to their tridentate functional
group.28−31 In addition, it has been observed that the structure of the alkyl
chain of the TRDGAs plays a key role in their extraction performance,
i.e., less steric hindrance in the alkyl chain attached to the amide
groups of the TRDGA extractants provides a better extraction ability
than higher alkyl chain counterparts.

By exploiting the advantage of strong affinity for
Ln(III) due
to the tridentate functional group of TRDGAs, we reported the extraction
behavior of europium, uranium, and plutonium from high nitric acid
solutions using N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)-diglycolamic
acid (HDEHDGA, HA).24 HDEHDGA possesses
a similar tridentate coordination functional group to the TRDGAs,
but it is a carboxylic acid ligand with one of the two amide groups
of TRDGAs replaced by a carboxy group, as shown in Scheme 1. The obtained results depicted
that HDEHDGA might act as normal carboxylic acids in the system of
low HNO3 concentration and the extraction process might
be governed by the cation-exchange mechanism. In contrast, at a high
concentration of nitric acid, the ligand formed a cationic complex
with lanthanide and actinide ions and the extraction was performed
through the ion-pair mechanism. Usually, the extractants behave quite
differently in systems of various anions (such as NO3–, Cl–, and SO42–) for the separation of Ln(III) ions.

Scheme 1 Structures of N,N-Di(2-ethylhexyl)-diglycolamic
acid (HDEHDGA, HA) and N,N-Dimethyl-diglycolamic
acid (HDMDGA, HA′)
To our best knowledge, the extraction of Ln(III)
ions from diluted
HCl solutions has not been reported so far. Therefore, the current
work presents the first study to examine the extraction of four light
Ln(III) ions, La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), and Nd(III) from diluted
HCl media using HDEHDGA/kerosene as an organic phase. Furthermore,
the complexation in the aqueous solution and the properties of the
solid-state complexes of Ln(III) ions with the water-soluble N,N-dimethyl-diglycolamic acid (HDMDGA,
HA′, also shown in Scheme 1) ligand were also investigated to help understanding
the extraction/separation mechanism of HDEHDGA. The complexation of
Ln(III) with HDMDGA in aqueous solutions and in solid-state compounds
parallels the chemistry of Ln(III) being complexed with HDEHDGA in
solvent extraction. The difference in the stability constants of the
1:3 Ln(III) complexes (LnA′3) in aqueous solutions
could be well correlated with the corresponding separation factors
obtained from the extraction with HDEHDGA. Therefore, the investigation
of the Ln(III) complexation with the N,N-dialkyl-diglycolamic acids not only provides structural and thermodynamic
information for the complexes but also develops a preliminary evaluation
and research methodology for predicting extraction behaviors of ligands
bearing the same functional group but different alkyl chains.

Results and Discussion
Effect of Acid Concentration on the Extraction
For
acidic extractants, the pH value of the aqueous solution plays a significant
role in the extraction process. The dependency of the extraction of
Ln(III) as individual metal ions (La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), and Nd(III))
on the acid concentrations was studied at 25 °C with a constant
ligand concentration in the organic phase. As shown in Figure 1, the extraction of Ln(III)
ions increases with the increasing pH values of the equilibrated aqueous
phase.

Figure 1 Effect of pH of the equilibrated aqueous phase on the Ln(III) extraction.
Organic phase, 0.01 M HDEHDGA; initial concentrations of Ln(III) in
aqueous phase: [La3+] = 0.018 mM, [Ce3+] = 0.0157
mM, [Pr3+] = 0.0142 mM, [Nd3+] = 0.0156 mM,
in 1 M NaCl.

The linear plots of log D versus pH suggest
that only one major complex species of each Ln(III) was formed in
the organic phase. The slope values of 2.7–2.9 for the four
linear lines are found in consistence with the common slope value
of 3 for the monobasic carboxylic acid extractants. These results
indicate that under the conditions of low HCl concentration, HDEHDGA
acts as normal acidic extractants and the extraction of light Ln(III)
is governed by the ion-exchange mechanism. During the extraction,
as one Ln(III) ion is extracted into the organic phase, three H+ are released into the corresponding aqueous phase to balance
the charge spontaneously. At pH about 2.8, most of Ln(III) ions were
extracted into the organic phase. The trend in the extraction percentage
follows the order Nd > Pr > Ce > La with values of 99.9,
99.5, 98.1,
and 85.1%, respectively. This behavior is ascribed to the lanthanide
contraction as expected.24,33 In contrast, the typical
carboxylic acid extractant (Versatic 10) provides low extractability
for Ln(III) in the same pH range and the quantitative extraction was
achieved under much higher pH values (6–7).32

Effect of HDEHDGA Concentration on the Ln(III) Extraction
The dependency of Ln(III) extraction on the concentration of the
extractant in the organic phase may provide information about the
composition of the extracted complexes. At the initial ligand concentration
ranging from 0.004 to 0.022 M and fixed metal ion(s) concentration
in 1 M NaCl at pH 2, the effect of the ligand concentration on the
extraction of the four light Ln(III) ions was investigated at 25 °C.
As it is well known, for most carboxylic acids, a dimer may be formed
in nonpolar or low-polarity diluents.34,35

To get
reliable quantitative information about the ligand concentration dependency,
the fraction of the dimer has to be corrected from the apparent ligand
concentration in the organic phase. In a separate experiment, the
constant for the reaction of dimerization was found to be about 32
(see Section A, Supporting Information
(SI)). In addition, the amount of ligand consumed for forming the
complexes should also be corrected, but it was ignored due to the
relatively low initial Ln(III) concentrations used in the extraction
experiments for the slope analysis method.

In general, with
the ion-exchange mechanism, the extraction reaction
for monobasic acidic can be expressed as follows 1  then the extraction constant (Kex) based on eq 1 is defined as 2  The logarithmic relation of eq 2 can be written as 3a   3b  The plots of log D–3pH against log[HA] are in good linear relationships for
the four Ln(III) ions ([HA] is the free HDEHDGA concentration in the
equilibrated organic phase). As shown in Figure 2, the slopes of the four linear lines depict
that the molar ratio of the ligand, [HA + A–], to
Ln(III) in the extracted complexes is not 3:1 as that of the number
of the exchanged protons for each Ln(III) extraction.22,24,33,36 Based on these results, we can speculate that one or two neutral
HDEHDGA molecules exist in the second coordination sphere of Ln(III)
complexes through hydrogen bonding between their −COOH and
the −COO– of A– in the
first coordination sphere. However, it is difficult to predict the
exact modes of these extra HA molecules connecting to the LnA3 core without further structural information. For common acidic
extractants, it is observed that the neutral protonated extractant
molecules may bond to the core of the extracted complexes via hydrogen
bonding.27,37 Due to the complexity caused by the protonated
extractant molecules (HAs) attaching to the core of the extracted
complexes, the powerful slope analysis method could not well provide
useful information about the structures and compositions of the extracted
complexes, as discussed in the ref (38). Baba et al. reported a similar observation
on the complexation between N-[N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)aminocarbonylmethl] glycine (D2EHAG)
and Sc(III). A complex of 1:4 metal/ligand (ScR3·HR)
was determined and verified by the loading tests and Job’s
continuous variation technique.39

concentration on Ln(III) extraction. Initial
aqueous solution: [HCl] = 0.01 M, [La3+] = 0.013 mM, [Ce3+] = 0.015 mM, [Pr3+] = 0.014 mM, [Nd3+] = 0.016 mM, in 1 M NaCl.

The values of log Kex were directly
obtained from the intercepts of the straight lines in Figure 2 using eq 3b. The values of log Kex are 2.89, 3.51, 3.71, and 4.05 with the respective nonintegral n values of 4.45, 4.40, 4.30, and 4.25 for La(III), Ce(III),
Pr(III), and Nd(III), respectively. The apparent difference among
these values illustrates considerably increasing stability of the
extracted complexes of HDEHDGA with Ln(III) as the atomic number increases,
possibly hinting good selectivity for the adjacent light Ln(III) ions.

Effect of Temperature on the Extraction
The temperature
variation method is often used in solvent extraction studies to evaluate
the influence of temperature on the extraction and to abstract the
thermodynamic information about the extracted complexes. The standard
free energy of a complexation/extraction reaction is defined as 4   5  The enthalpy, ΔH, of
the extraction can be indirectly measured by determining the distribution
ratios (D values) at different temperatures as described
by eq 6. 6  The distribution ratios of La(III), Ce(III),
Pr(III), and Nd(III) between 0.01 M HDEHDGA in kerosene and 0.015
mM of each Ln(III) in 1 M NaCl at pH 2.2 over the range of 25–60
°C were determined. As shown in Figure 3, the D values for the four
studied Ln(III) ions decrease with the increasing temperature. The
plots of log D against (1000/T) present good linear relationship, indicating that across the tested
temperature range, the enthalpies of the extraction might remain constant
or do not undergo obvious change. The enthalpies for the extractions
of the four Ln(III) ions can be calculated from the slopes of the
straight lines in Figure 3. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and the entropy (ΔS) of the system at 25
°C are calculated using eqs 4 and 5, respectively, and the data are
listed in Table 2.
The results show that the extraction of light Ln(III) with HDEHDGA
becomes stronger with the increasing atomic number of the Ln(III)
ions. This result is consistent with the common observation about
the interaction between hard acids and hard bases. In general, Ln(III)
ions are considered hard acids that favor ionic bonding and the deprotonated
HDEHDGA with a negatively charged carboxylate group is a typical hard
base. However, the calculated enthalpies of the extraction (ΔH) become less exothermic, suggesting that the change in
enthalpy is less favorable to the extraction from La(III) to Nd(III).
The controversy of stronger extraction but less exothermic enthalpy
might be ascribed to the difference in hydration energy and hydration
number among the Ln(III) ions. The hydration energy of Ln(III) becomes
more negative from La(III) to Nd(III). Therefore, more energy is required
to dehydrate La(III) to form extracted complexes with deprotonated
HDEHDGA, resulting in less exothermic enthalpy. The less negative
trend in the change of entropy might be explained with the decreasing n values from La(III) to Nd(III) as described in Figure 2. Smaller n values suggest that less HA molecules connect to the LnA3 core, resulting in more free HA molecules, less negative
entropy, and more favorable extraction from La(III) to Nd(III).

Crystal Structure of La/NdA′3 Complexes
The solid compounds LaA′3 and NdA′3 obtained from 95% ethanol solutions by slow evaporation are
isostructural complexes, where A′– stands
for the deprotonated HDMDGA. Colorless blocks of LaA′3 and pale blue blocks of NdA′3 were crystallized
in P1̅ space group. In the neutral LaA′3 complex, La(III) ion is surrounded by nine oxygen atoms from
three tridentate A′– anions, forming a distorted
tricapped trigonal prism geometry with six carboxyl oxygen atoms at
the corners and three ether oxygen atoms capped on the three faces.
For NdA′3, the coordination core is almost identical
to the previously reported compound, NdA′3(H2O)7.5, that is obtained from the aqueous solution.30 The only difference between the two compounds
(NdA′3 and NdA′3(H2O)7.5) is the content of the water of crystallization.
NdA′3 does not contain any water of crystallization
unlike NdA′3(H2O)7.5 that
contains some water molecules of crystallization (see the SI).

The structure of LaA′3 is illustrated in Figure 4, and the selected bond lengths of LaA′3 and NdA′3 are listed in Table 3. Furthermore, the corresponding bond lengths
of NdA′3·7.5H2O are also mentioned
for comparison.30

The difference in average bond lengths for the three
categories
of Ln–O in both complexes (LaA′3 and NdA′3) are 0.053, 0.063, and 0.061 Å for Ln–Ocaboxylate, Ln–Oamide, and Ln–Oether, respectively.
These values are very close to 0.056 Å that represents the difference
between the radii of La3+ and Nd3+. The structural
information indicate that there is no/negligible steric hindrance
during the formation of the two 1:3 LnA′3 complexes.
As a result, the bonding between the ligand and the central Ln3+ is mainly governed by the electrostatic interaction.

Absorption/Reflectance Spectra of Nd(III) Complexes
To confirm the extraction mechanism via the slope analysis method
described by eq 1, the
UV–vis absorption spectrum of the extracted Nd(III) complex
was collected. The obtained spectrum was compared with those of 1:3
metal/ligand complexes of NdA′3 in the aqueous solution
and in the solid compound.30 As shown in Figure 5, the three spectra
are very comparable, suggesting that the extracted complex of Nd(III)
with the HDEHDGA in the organic phase possesses a very similar coordination
geometry to those of NdA′3 in the aqueous solution
and in the solid state. Obviously, there are more detailed features
in the spectrum of the extracted complex than that of NdA′3 in the aqueous solution, revealing that the extracted complex
represents more defined structure. This might be caused by two facts;
one is that the ligand-exchange rate for the extracted complex is
slower than that for the NdA′3 in aqueous solutions;
the other fact is that the additional neutral HA molecules in the
second coordination sphere (connected through hydrogen bonding) provide
extra stability for the inner core NdA3 in the organic
phase. However, these speculations need to be further confirmed by
other techniques in the future such as metal loading tests and electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) investigations.

NdA3·(HA)1or2(org.) and NdA′3(aq.) (A′ = N,N-dimethyl-diglycolmate)

of solid compound NdA′3. The organic phase for NdA3·(HA)1or2 was prepared from extraction with
0.5 M HDEHDGA and 0.05 M Nd(III) in 1 M NaCl at pH 2.

Group Extraction/Separation of Light Ln(III) Ions
In
the liquid–liquid extraction, the SF is defined as the ratio
of the D values for the two interested components.
If the SF value is close to one, the separation of two adjacent Ln(III)
ions will be very complicated and difficult. Thus, the higher the
values of SF, the better the separation of the two elements.40

The data in Table 4 illustrate that HDEHDGA might have good
selectivity for adjacent light Ln(III) ions. The selectivity of HDEHDGA
toward light Ln(III) ions was investigated using more concentrated
solutions. The aqueous phase containing 0.003 M each of the four light
Ln(III) and 0.01 M HCl in 1 M NaCl was equilibrated with 0.2 M HDEHDGA
in kerosene. As listed in Table 4, HDEHDGA presents very good separation ability toward
the light Ln(III) including La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), and Nd(III).
It is well known that some organophosphorus ligands such as P204,
P507, and Cyanex 272 have been broadly applied for lanthanides extraction/separation
in the industry. In comparison to these ligands, HDEHDGA presents
much better separation factors for light adjacent Ln(III) ions. Thus,
this property can offer more effective processes for the extraction/separation
of light Ln(III) ions in the industry.

Stripping Ln(III) Ions and Reusability of HDEHDGA
The
stripping process is important for the separation and purification
of metal ions. In the striping experiments, a specific volume of 0.01
M HDEHDGA loaded with Nd(III) was contacted to an equal volume of
the stripping solution (HCl, H2SO4, or HNO3) for 15 min at 25 °C. As shown in Figure S1 (Section B, Supporting Information (SI)), the stripping
efficiency was determined with different concentrations of the aforementioned
acids (0.01–1 M). The obtained results in Table 5 depict that the stripping efficiency
is improved by increasing the acid concentrations in the aqueous phase
(stripping solution). The results also indicate that the concentration
of 0.1 M of HCl is high enough to quantitatively recover Nd(III) under
the investigated conditions. Moreover, at the same acid concentrations,
the two monobasic acids (HCl and HNO3) are found to be
better stripping reagents than the dibasic acid H2SO4 that provides two times H+ at the same concentration.
These observations hint that the mechanism for the extraction in the
sulfate system could be different and the sulfate anion might be involved
in the extraction process.

Acid Concentration

To examine the reusability of HDEHDGA, six cycles
of extraction/striping
were carried out at the same conditions. After each extraction cycle,
the loaded organic phase was contacted with 1 M HCl as a stripping
agent that was chosen to ensure the quantitative recovery of Nd(III)
in one stripping stage. As shown in Figure S2, Section B, SI, the extraction efficiency is practically stable
even after six extraction/stripping cycles, indicating that HDEHDGA
presents good extraction performance.

Complexation of Ln(III) Ions with HDMDGA
To help understanding
the extraction/separation of Ln(III) with HDEHDGA, the complexation
of the four light Ln(III) ions with HDMDGA was investigated in aqueous
solutions and solid-state compounds. The stability constants for Ln(III)
ions with HDMDGA were determined by potentiometry in 1 M NaCl at 25
°C. Figure 6 shows
representative potentiometric titrations of the complexation of Ln(III)
ions with A′–. The best model to fit the
potentiometric data includes the formation of three successive Ln(III)/A′– complexes for each Ln(III) 7  The calculated stability constants for [LnA′n](3–n)+ are
listed in Table 6.
In this study, the stability constants of the Nd(III)/A′– complexes are in a good agreement with those measured
in 1 M NaClO4 in the literature.30 Under the experimental conditions, only completely deprotonated
A′– is found in all of the Ln(III) complexes.
The Ln(III) ions bear the same charge of +3 in aqueous solutions,
but the ionic radii decrease with increasing the atomic number because
of the lanthanide contraction effect. Therefore, the overall charge
density on the adjacent Ln(III) ions increases slightly from the light
to the heavy Ln(III) ions. As a result, stronger complexation along
the whole Ln(III) series occurs when the interactions with the ligands
are dominantly electrostatic in nature. The data in Table 6 verify that the trends in complex
stability are consistent with those predicted by the overall charge
density.

Comparison between Extraction and Complexation in Aqueous Solutions
The comparison between the corresponding extracted complexes with
HDEHDGA in the organic phase and the complexes formed with HDMDGA
in the aqueous solution is further evaluated. Since there is no/negligible
significant steric effect from the alkyl groups of HDEHDGA, it is
reasonable to assume that the extracted complexes for all four light
Ln(III) ions share a similar composition and coordination geometry.
The separation factors are mainly originated from varying electrostatic
interaction due to the increasing charge density from La(III) to Nd(III).
According to the similarity in the spectra shown in Figure 5, we can infer that LnA3 cores in the extracted complexes and the LnA′3 complexes in aqueous solutions also share a similar coordination
geometry to that LnA′3 complexes in solid compounds. Therefore, by
assuming that all other trivial parallel factors can be canceled for
a pair of adjacent Ln(III) ions. Thus, the difference in the interaction
of Ln(III) with HDEHDGA in the extraction system can be translated
to the difference in the stability constants of the corresponding
complexes with HDMDGA in the aqueous solution. As recorded in Table 7, the ratios of the
stability constants of the 1:3 complexes of HDMDGA for the three adjacent
Ln(III) pairs are fairly comparable to those for the corresponding
extracted complexes of HDEHDGA. Theoretically, the Kex(M2)/Kex(M1) ratio should
be equal to the SF (DM2/DM1). However, a considerable deviation is shown in Table 7, which may be attributed
to the different experimental conditions in conjunction with the experimental
errors. For the slope analysis method, a trace amount of Ln(III) was
used to obtain the extraction constants (as clear in eq 2), whereas, in Table 7, the SFs are calculated from
the D values that originated from the extraction
under the conditions of much higher concentrations of Ln(III) ions
(0.012 M as total Ln(III) concentration). On the other hand, the ratios
of the stability constants of MA′3 complexes β(M2)/β(M1) are in a good consistency to the
corresponding SFs. It should be noted that the experimental conditions
for the SFs and stability constants measurements are very similar
particularly for the Ln(III) and ligand concentrations. The consistency
in the ratios (β(M2)/β(M1)) and
SFs furnishes a striking piece of evidence about the assumption that
the cores (LnA3) of the extracted complexes share similar
coordination geometry and possess common composition with the LnA′3 complexes in the aqueous solution.

Conclusions
The extraction behavior of the light Ln(III)
ions from the HCl–NaCl
system has been investigated in the low pH region using N,N-di(2-ethylhexyle)-diglycolamic acid as an extractant.
The results reveal that the extraction is mainly governed by the cation-exchange
reaction mechanism and is driven by the negative change in enthalpy.
Based on the results from the slope analysis method and absorption
spectroscopy, the first coordination core of the major extracted species
might be the 1:3 complex, LnA3 (A = deprotonated HDEHDGA).
Furthermore, in the second coordination sphere, there is/are one or
two HA molecules attached to the core through hydrogen bonding. By
correlating the extraction with HDEHDGA and the complexation with
HDMDGA thermodynamically and structurally, the origin of the separation
factor (selectivity) for the extraction system is well interpreted
with the difference in the stability constants of the corresponding
complexes in aqueous solutions. Also, this exploration provides an
invigorating approach in revealing the related extraction mechanism
and the structural information about the extracted complexes. In comparison
to those currently deployed extractants in industry, HDEHDGA exhibits
considerably better separation factors for the light adjacent Ln(III)
pairs, presenting a practical approach for developing new processes
of light Ln(III) extraction/separation in the industry.

Experimental Section
Materials and Instrumentation
HDEHDGA and HDMDGA of
purity >97% were prepared by adopting the previously published
procedure
at China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE).47 Lanthanide chloride salts of high purity (>99.9%) were supplied
by Aladdin Industrial Corporation, Shanghai, China. Kerosene of AR
grade from Tianjin Hengxing Chemical Preparation Co., Ltd. was used
as received. Other chemicals were analytical-grade (AR) or higher.
All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water. The pH
values of the working solutions were adjusted with standardized diluted
NaOH or HCl solutions and were monitored with a pH meter (Mettler
Toledo FiveEasy plus FP20, Germany). All extraction experiments were
conducted in a thermostatic vortex shaker equipped with a temperature
controller. The initial and equilibrated metal ion concentrations
in the aqueous phase were determined with inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (IRIS Intrepid II XSP).

Preparation of the Stock Solutions
A stock solution
of the organic phase (0.5 M) was prepared by dissolving a desired
weight of HDEHDGA in kerosene, washing with an equal volume of 1 M
HCl once and with deionized water thrice. Stock solutions of metal
ions were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of Ln(III) chlorides
in deionized water, and the pH values were adjusted using diluted
HCl solutions. The final concentrations of Ln(III) ions in the stock
solutions were determined with ICP-MS.

Solvent Extraction
All extraction experiments were
carried out in triplicates under the same conditions, and the calculated
relative standard deviations were less than 5%. In general, equal
volumes (5 mL) of the aqueous phase and organic phase were equilibrated
for 15 min at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. Preliminary experiments
indicated that the extraction equilibrium could be reached in 5 min.
After extraction, the phase separation was facilitated by centrifugation.
The Ln(III) ions loaded in the organic phase were stripped using 1
M HCl, and then, the concentration of Ln(III) ions in both the aqueous
phase and the stripe solution was directly measured by ICP-MS after
appropriate dilution with 5% HNO3 taking into consideration
the minimum detection limit (DL) of lanthanides by an ICP-MS instrument,
(DL = 0.1 μg L–1). The effect of temperature
on the extraction of Ln(III) ions was examined within the range of
25–60 °C. All of the experiments were conducted at a fixed
ionic strength of 1 M NaCl. In the stripping experiments, the loaded
organic phase was contacted with different concentrations of HCl,
HNO3, and H2SO4 at 25 °C for
15 min.

The distribution ratio (D) is defined
as 8  where [M]org. and [M]aq. stand for metal ion concentrations in the organic and aqueous phases,
respectively. The extraction and stripping percentages are calculated
as 9   10  where Vaq. and Vorg. denote the volumes of aqueous and organic
solutions, respectively.

The separation factor (SF) is defined
as 11  where M1 and M2 represent
different metal ions.

UV–Vis Absorption/Reflectance Spectroscopy
The
absorption/reflectance spectra of Nd(III) complexes in solutions or
solid compound were recorded by a UV–vis–near-infrared
(NIR) spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin Elmer or Cary 7000 UMS,
Agilent) with setting of 0.15 nm intervals and 0.50 nm spectral bandwidth
at 25 °C. Quartz cells of 1 cm path length were used for samples
in solutions. For the reflectance spectrum of NdA′3, a piece of Teflon sheet was used for baseline correction, and then
about 20 mg of NdA′3 was sealed between the Teflon
sheet and one quartz window (1 mm × 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm). The
solution containing the extracted complexes of Nd(III) with HA was
prepared by contacting the same volume of 0.5 M HA in kerosene and
1 M NaCl solution containing 0.05 M Nd(III) and 0.15 M NaOH, which
was gradually dropped into during the extraction. The Nd(III) was
almost completely extracted into the organic phase, and the spectrum
was collected and normalized to 1 M Nd(III).

Potentiometry
Potentiometric titrations were carried
out at 25 °C for the complexation of four light Ln(III) ions
with HDMDGA (HA′) in 1 M NaCl. The potential (E) was measured with a potentiometric titrator (MetrohmTitrando 907)
equipped with a Combined pH electrode (Metrohm Unitrode 6.0259.100).
Ideally, the potential, E, of a glass electrode follows
the Nernst equation, eq 12 12  where E0 is called
the standard electrode potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (K), F is the Faraday
constant, and {H+} is the activity of H+. The
Nernst equation shows the electrode response to be linear in hydrogen
ion activity as indicated by {H+}. Under conditions of
relatively high ionic strength, 1 M NaCl, taking account of the activity
coefficient quotient of a constant that is considerably different
from 1, the standard Nernst equation for the glass electrode was modified
as the empirical equation, eq 13 13  where [H+] stands for the concentration
of H+. To obtain the electrode parameters of E0 and s, before each titration, an acid/base
titration with standard hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide was
carried out under experimental conditions. These parameters allowed
calculating the concentrations of H+ from the values of
the potential measured in immediately following titration. In a typical
titration, a solution (about 20 mL) containing appropriate amounts
of H+ and one of the four lightest lanthanides was titrated
with a solution of partially neutralized HA′ in 1 M NaCl. The
potential values were recorded with the data collection criterion,
i.e., the drift of potential (ΔE) less than
0.1 mV in 180 s after each addition of titrant solution. Sixty to
one hundred data points were collected in each titration. Multiple
titrations were performed for each Ln(III) with solutions of different
initial concentrations of Ln(III) and H+. The stability
constants of Ln(III)/A′– complexes were calculated
with the Hyperquad (2013) program.48

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Block crystals of
LnA′3(Ln = La, Nd) were obtained from 2 mL of 95% ethanol solutions containing
0.1 M Ln(III) and 0.4 M NaA′ by slow evaporation. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Super Nova, Dual, Cu at
home/near, AtlasS2 diffractometer using graphite monochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Using Olex2,49 the structures were solved with the ShelXT50 structure solution program using direct methods
and refined with the ShelXL51 refinement
package using least squares minimization. All of the hydrogen atoms
were geometrically fixed using the riding model. Crystal data for
