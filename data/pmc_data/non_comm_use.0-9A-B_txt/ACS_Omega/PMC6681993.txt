In this article, two two-dimensional
and three-dimensional metal–organic
frameworks are synthesized by the self-assembly of copper(I) halide
and the hexamethylenetetramine (hmt) ligand. Compound 1 is a two-dimensional metal–organic framework composed of
a pyramidal Cu4I5 cluster and hexamethylenetetramine,
in which hmt-bridged Cu clusters form a two-dimensional (4,4)-connected
net with a point symbol of (44·62) (44·62). Compound 2 is a homochiral
three-dimensional metal–organic framework material generated
through an unusual spontaneous crystallization from achiral precursors.
The two compounds were characterized by a series of analyses such
as infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, circular dichroism spectroscopy,
and powder X-ray diffraction. Both of them exhibit unexpected stability
under a wide range of conditions of acid and base. In addition, the
fluorescence intensity changes regularly under acid–base conditions.
Stokes shift shows a good linear relationship with −log [H+], which makes them become promising acid–base sensors.
Compounds 1 and 2 also display selective
adsorption and a significant degradation effect on the organic dye
methylene blue. In addition, the fluorescence study indicated that
compound 2 could be used as a sensor to detect Cr3+.

==== Body
Introduction
At present, the assembly
of metal–organic frameworks is
of great significance because of their high specific surface area,
porosity, and plasticity, together with structural diversity and interesting
topologies. In some aspects of chirality, gas storage, catalysis,
zeolite behavior, etc., they show potential applications as functional
materials.1−4 One of the basic strategies for the construction of functional materials
is the employment of organic ligands with tetrahedral nodes. Since
the hexamethylenetetramine (hmt, by name urotropine) molecule contains
four tetrahedral nitrogen atoms after coordination, it becomes a potential
multifunctional tetrahedral node. The crystal structures of copper
chloride and hmt have been obtained, but the desired crystal structure
has not been obtained with copper(I) bromide and iodide as inorganic
building centers. This article helps overcome this challenge.5 From 1923, the molecular structure of hmt began
to enter our field of vision.6,7 Due to the fascinating
structure of cage trialkylamine, there has been great interest in
the fields of organic synthesis, chemical industry, molecular catalysis,
disinfectants, pesticides, curing agents, pharmaceutical physics,
and military applications.8 Hmt exhibits
a variety of coordination modes including monodentate(t-), bidentate(μ-), tridentate(μ3-), and tetradentate(μ4-) ligands in combination with metal salts and produces a
large number of fascinating functional metal–hmt complexes.9 It is worth mentioning that there exist coordinatively
unsaturated sites (refers to nitrogen) for the first three coordination
configurations(t-, μ-, μ3-),
which may have laid the foundation for ion recognition. However, it
is very difficult to achieve pure chirality from the achiral precursor
hmt. The addition of an inducer has paved the way to a new field in
the development of pure chiral materials.10 Due to the relative earth abundance of these metals, the participation
of copper species can form functional mononuclear or multinuclear
metal–cluster complexes. This has led to an interest in the
development and utilization of copper metal salts.11−18

In this paper, {[hmt][Cu4I5][H2O]5[NH4]+}n(1) and {[hmt][Cu3Br3][H2O]}n(2) were synthesized.
The formed Cu4I5 cluster is connected to four
N atoms on hmt. It turns out that multifunctional materials may be
produced by clusters instead of metal centers.19 Since the copper iodide clusters form Cu4I4 (or Cu3I4) as four-connected nodes,20 the clusters are diverse in form and complicated
in structure. The formation of Cu4I5 clusters
in this paper may give the material unique functionality. Further,
copper(I) bromide forms a three-coordinate structure with hexamethylenetetramine
to form a three-dimensional structure. It was also synthesized for
the first time.

Our team has long been committed to the construction
of organic–inorganic
hybrid compounds and the analysis of their physicochemical properties.21−25 We further studied the properties of the compounds and found that
they have high stability under acid–base conditions. The detection
of acid–base stability to organometallic compounds was common,26−29 but there are few examples of this in the field of organic–inorganic
hybrid compounds, mainly because of their instability under acidic
or basic conditions.30 Further, compounds 1 and 2 have been found to have good photocatalytic
degradation properties for the organic dye methylene blue. Since trivalent
metal ions play an important role in the human body and in the environment,
we chose Cr3+ to evaluate the characteristics of fluorescent
probes and found that compound 2 exhibited a high-sensitivity
and high-selectivity fluorescence response to Cr3+. It
is known that due to complexation with metal ions, charge-transfer
interaction is reduced to enhance the fluorescence signal.31 We conclude that the availability of lone-pair
electrons on the uncoordinated nitrogen of compound 2 without coordination will promote the complexation with metal ions.

Results
and Discussion
Description of Crystal Structures
Compound 1 indicates that {[hmt][Cu4I5]−[H2O]5[NH4]+}n (1) crystallizes
in a tetragonal
space group P4/nmm. The asymmetric
unit of the compound contains one hmt ligand and [Cu4I5]− clusters, as shown in Figure S1a. Interestingly, the geometry of the anionic [Cu4I5]− cluster is a square pyramid
with four Cu and five I atoms (Figure S1b). The compound is formed by the [Cu4I5]− clusters and the ligand hmt. In compound 1, the hmt ligand is tetradentate (μ4-hmt), linking
to four metal ions (Figure 1a). Two hmt molecules form a 10-membered ring with two [Cu4I5]− clusters. The distance between
Cu···Cu in the 10-membered ring is 6.584 Å and
between C···C is 3.529 Å (Figure S1c). In view of the topology, however, the minimum
closed loops around the nodes involved in symmetry-related ligands
and Cu1 ions are (44·62). Thus, the two-dimensional
(2D) structure of compound 1 can be described as an interesting four-connected
net with the point symbol of (44·62) (44·62) in which Cu(I) centers and ligands act
as four-connected nodes (Figure 1b).

atoms have been omitted for clarity). (b) Topological structure of
the 2D network in 1. (c) Stacked view from the a-axis direction. (d) Single-stranded right-handed helical
strand twisted along the b-axis.

The compound {[hmt][Cu3Br3][H2O]}n (2) crystallizes in
the chiral space group P43 with a Flack
parameter of 0.09(12). Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that 2 represents a rare three-connected three-dimensional chiral
network. The structural unit of 2 is shown in Figure S2a. In compound 2, the hmt
ligand is tridentate (μ3-hmt), linking to three metal
ions (Figure 1c). There
are three different coordination environments for Cu atoms in the
structural unit diagram. The Cu1, Cu2, and Cu3 atoms are all coordinated
by the N atom from the hmt ligand. Cu1 and Cu2 ions are interconnected
by two μ2-Br1 and μ2-Br2, respectively,
to form a dinuclear Cu cluster. From the b-axis direction,
a distorted quadrangle is formed (Figure S2b). The distorted quadrilateral consists of two hmt ligands and a
small quadrilateral formed by two copper atoms and two bromine atoms.
The distance between Cu···Cu in the quadrangle is 10.857
Å. From the a-axis direction, units of compound 2 are arranged in parallel to each other in the ABAB manner
to produce a chiral structure (Figure 1c). It forms right-handed helixes along the b axis with large pitches of 27.2948(55) Å. The ligand
and metal ion Cu(I) assembly yields a crystal helical chirality (Figure 1d). Synthesis of
a homochiral network that can be established by three methods has
been reported: (i) using enantiopure precursors, (ii) through spontaneous
resolution occurring during crystallization, and (iii) using achiral
precursors in the presence of chirality-inducing agents such as chiral
additives, chiral solvents, or chiral catalysts.41c The chiral compound 2 in this paper is synthesized
by self-assembly and crystallization in solution using CuBr and an
organic ligand (hmt), which should be assigned to method (ii).

Acid–Base
Resistance
We soaked compounds 1–2 in an aqueous solution of acid and
base to explore their stability to acid and base. Compounds 1–2 of the same quality were soaked for
1 day at a range of pH values and then subjected to IR spectroscopy
measurements. Compound 1 can maintain its structure at
pH = 3–13. In the infrared spectrum, the stretching vibration
peak of the C–N group at about 1366 cm–1 gradually
disappears, indicating that the acid concentration changes, which
causes the skeleton to collapse. There is no peak at pH = 1 and pH
= 2 at 3257 cm–1 (Figure S3a). However, for compound 2, at pH = 1, there is no peak
at 3257 cm–1. This indicates that compound 2 can remain structurally intact in the range of pH = 2–13
(Figure S3b).

Photoluminescence Properties
The solid-state fluorescence
properties of compounds 1–2 at normal
temperature were studied, and the fluorescence intensity of compound 1 was weaker than that of compound 2. The corresponding
luminescent color of compound 1 is yellow and that of
compound 2 is green as shown by CIE (x, y) (Figure 2a). The emission wavelength of the compounds shifts; we further
speculate that the emission of the compound may be caused by a different
halide–metal charge transfer. In view of the intensity of fluorescence,
we monitored the solvent fluorescence changes of compounds at different
pH values.32 The pH is adjusted herein
using an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide
to record the corresponding fluorescent emissions. The emission wavelength
of compound 1 in an aqueous solution was 383 nm (λex = 290 nm). As the pH gradually reached pH = 3, the maximum
emission wavelength was 412 nm. Throughout the experiment, the total
Stokes shift reached 20 nm (Figure 2b). In addition, the Stokes shift showed an overall
blue shift, after adding the base. However, as the pH increases (Figure 2c), the changes in
compound 1 are as follows: pH = 8 (314 nm) < pH =
9 (332 nm) < pH = 10 (348 nm) < pH = 12 (353 nm) < pH = 13
(355 nm). In addition, the results show that the Stokes shift has
a linear relationship with −log [H+] (Figure 2d,e). Compound 2 gradually decreases in fluorescence intensity with increasing
pH in an acidic aqueous solution (Figure 2f). As the pH in the alkaline aqueous solution
increases, the fluorescence intensity of compound 2 is
gradually enhanced (Figure 2g). The reason for the change in fluorescence intensity under
different acid–base conditions is that when a certain group
in the compounds is protonated or deprotonated, it is possible to
induce a change in the fluorescence intensity of the compounds. The
electrons of the electron donor are transferred to the electron acceptor,
which produces a fluorescence-quenching phenomenon. When the electron
donor is combined with the proton, the electron transfer is inhibited,
thereby causing the recovery of fluorescence.32c

Dye Adsorption
Organic dyes are used in many fields.33−35 Therefore, a method
for extracting dyes from a solution has been
of wide concern.36−38 The absorption of dye molecules by the use of organometallic
compounds is very popular. Methylene blue (MB) is used herein as the
adsorbed dye. Compared with compound 2, compound 1 has a more obvious adsorption effect at 210 min (Figures S5 and S6). The amount of adsorbed dye
can be calculated by the following formula: Qeq = (C0 – Ceq)V/M.39 It is known from the figure that the adsorption effect
of compound 2 is weaker than that of compound 1 (Figure S7), and the adsorption amount
of compound 2 is also increased by prolonging the adsorption
time. Therefore, both compounds 1 and 2 have
a good adsorption capacity for the organic dye MB.

Photocatalytic
Activities
The UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra of a powder sample with a band gap (Eg) of 1 is used, which is reflected using
reflectance. The Kubelka–Munk function F is
plotted on the energy map E, and F = (1 – R)2/2R is converted from the recorded diffuse reflection data.40 The gap values are 1.55 and 1.87 ev, as shown
in Figure S8. This indicates that compounds 1–2 are semiconducting when exposed to visible light
and have possible photocatalytic activity. The photocatalysts (compounds 1–2) are semiconductor materials. Therefore, the organic
dye MB was photodegraded by the photoexcitation of compounds 1–2. The degradation efficiency is mainly
determined by the free carrier available on the surface of the photocatalysts.
Semiconductor materials have been shown to have higher electron transport
rates and better material properties. The photocatalytic degradation
efficiencies of the organic dye MB with respect to compounds 1–2 are shown in Figures S9 and S10, and the absorption spectrum of MB is remarkably lowered
as the reaction time increases. Furthermore, the change of the concentration
of the MB solution with time was plotted (C0: initial concentration of MB; C: dye concentration
at any given time). The results showed that the degradation rate of
compound 1 in 40 min was 70%, whereas the degradation
rate of compound 2 in 140 min was 16% (Figure 3a,b). Compound 1 has a high decomposition activity for MB under visible-light irradiation.
We studied the reaction kinetics. The catalytic process conforms to
the quasi-first-order kinetic equation as shown in Figure 3c,d. Then, we tested the stability
of compounds 1–2 before and after catalysis, and
the characteristic peaks before and after the contrast infrared image
basically existed (Figure S11). To evaluate
the recoverability and reusability of compounds 1 and 2, photocatalytic degradation of MB for three cycles was performed.
As can be seen from Figure 3e,f, similar photocatalytic efficiencies were maintained even
after repetition. It can be seen from Figure S11c,d that the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the compound
after photodegradation is almost the same as that of the synthetic
sample, which further proves that compounds 1 and 2 do not degrade under photodegradation conditions.

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Since compound 2 has
chiral space groups, solid-state circular dichroism (CD) spectra
have been measured for further demonstrating its homochiral nature.41 The different peaks according to positive and
negative Cotton effects appear in the range of 200–260 nm,
which are shown in the CD spectra of compound 2 (Figure 4) The CD spectrum
of 2 exhibits positive Cotton effects centered at 210,
221, and 233 nm and negative Cotton effects centered at 202, 227,
and 257 nm. The results well-testify the chirality of compound 2.

Sensing of the Metal Cations
Therefore,
we use the
potential fluorescence properties of chiral compound to detect various
metal ions such as K+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Ba2+, Cr3+, and Fe3+. However,
chiral compound recognition is a chiral match between a chiral host
and an object, just like a hand and a glove.42 As shown in Figure 5a, it is observed that compound 2 has high sensitivity
and specificity for the selectivity of Cr3+ ions in aqueous
solution. Trivalent chromium (Cr3+) plays an important
role in the diet of humans and animals. It is also a stabilizer for
nucleic acids, which can prevent cancer. The lack of trivalent chromium
can cause diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and high blood pressure. Excessive
intake can lead to genotoxic effects. In addition, how to use the
convenient and quick method to detect trivalent chromium is an urgent
problem to be solved, due to its diversification and participation
in industrial and agricultural activities, making trivalent chromium
an environmental pollutant.43 The fluorescence
intensity at 392 nm was found to be enhanced. From the fluorescence
intensity ratio of different metal ions in the aqueous solution, it
is found that the intensity ratio on adding Cr3+ is 22
times that of the blank (Figure 5b). In contrast, other metal ions would have no obvious
influence on the fluorescence intensity of compound 2. The luminescence intensity gradually increases with the increase
of Cr3+ ion concentration. The fluorescence intensity of
compound 2 at 392 nm is proportional to the concentration
of Cr3+ within a certain range. A linear relationship of
Cr3+ detection under optimal conditions was obtained at
392 nm with a correlation coefficient of 0.996 (Figure S12). The increase in fluorescence intensity may be
due to the formation of an extended electron conjugation system between
metal ions, and it is also possible that the chelation of metal ions
with compound 2 produces stiffness in the molecule. The
regression equation is Y = 282.533 +19.503X. According to the reported method,44,45 the limit of detection for Cr3+ is up to 0.227 μM.
The relationship between the fluorescence intensity and mole fraction
is shown in Figure S13. The results show
that the emission intensity is close to the maximum when the mole
fraction of [Cr3+]/([2]+[Cr3+])
is about 0.5, indicating a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between 2 and Cr3+. All of these results are consistent
with the coordination configuration of the ligand μ3-hmt with a single active coordinate N site in compound 2. A possible sensing mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement of
compound 2 in the solvent media is proposed, wherein
the solvated Cr3+ with a larger ion radius forms complexes
with 2 as shown in Figure 6.45a The metal cation Cr3+ was bound to the lone pair on the uncoordinated amino group
nitrogen of μ3-hmt. The interaction of the cation
Cr3+ with the lone pair on the nitrogen atom in hmt results
in an inhibition of the photoelectron transfer process, giving rise
to the observed enhancement of fluorescence emission.45b−45d

Thermogravimetric (TG)
Studies
The TG curves of compounds 1–2 are provided in Figure S14. The frameworks
of compounds 1 and 2 were
stable up to ca. 300 and 240 °C, and so the overall thermal stability
is high. The TG trace of compound 1 exhibits two main
steps of weight loss, which correspond to the release of coordinate
inorganic groups and decomposition of organic groups. The organic
ligand of compounds 1–2 decompose,
which causes a decrease of 250–300 °C. The decomposition
of inorganic substances mainly occurs at 600–800 °C. Due
to the difference in the coordination mode of the ligands, the stable
temperatures of compounds 1 and 2 are quite
different. It appears that compound 2 has only one mass
drop and continuously loses weight from 300–800 °C, indicating
that the decomposition of the ligand is completed in one step.

Conclusions
In summary, we produced two compounds by the self-assembly of copper(I)
halides and a tetradentate hmt as a ligand. A two-dimensional metal–organic
framework compound with Cu4I5 clusters was synthesized
by reaction with CuI, and it was reacted with CuBr to form a three-coordinate
three-dimensional chiral structure. The study found that the compounds
have good acid–base stability and the Stokes shift has a good
linear relationship with −log [H+]. In addition,
we found that the compounds have the potential to adsorb and cause
photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue by visible light. The
highly selective and sensitive detection method of compound 2 for Cr3+ has been successfully applied to aqueous
solutions.
