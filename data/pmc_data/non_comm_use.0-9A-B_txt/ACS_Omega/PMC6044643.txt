Imaging agents with affinity for bone can enable early detection
of changes to bone mineral density, which is a hallmark of many bone-associated
pathologies such as Paget’s disease and osteoporosis. Here,
we report the development of a polymer nanoparticle (NP)-based multimodal
imaging probe that enables visualization of bone mineral phase in
near-infrared (NIR) optical tomography and detection in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasmall
superparamagnetic iron oxide was first encapsulated in NPs derived
by blending poly(dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid)–poly(ethylene
glycol) (PLGA–PEG) with N-hydroxysuccinimide
functionalized-PLGA (NHS–PLGA). Postmodification of NHS surface
functionality on the NPs with alendronic acid (Aln), a bone-targeting
ligand, yielded stable ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
(USPIONs) containing NPs that exhibit good serum stability and favorable
cytocompatibility. These post-Aln-modified NPs exhibit 8- to 10-fold
higher affinity for synthetic and biogenic hydroxyapatite in comparison
to NPs where Aln was introduced before NP formation and shorten the T2 relaxation times in both agarose phantoms
and fresh spongy bone, thus enabling the interrogation of bone mineral
phase in T2-MRI. Finally, by introducing
an NIR-dye-modified PLGA during the NP formation step, NP probes that
enable the visualization of bone mineral phase in both NIR optical
tomography and MRI have been realized. The system presented herein
meets many of the criteria for clinical translation and therefore
opens new opportunities for bone imaging and targeted therapeutics.

==== Body
Introduction
Functional imaging has become a mainstay in both preclinical and
clinical studies. Among the
imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a wide acceptance
because it employs nonionizing radiation and yields detailed structural
information owing to its inherent high soft-tissue contrast.1 Between longitudinal (T1)- and transverse (T2)-weighted
MRI, T2-imaging is particularly useful
in visualization pathologies involving changes in water content, such
as edema, and inflammation. Although qualitative approaches based
on clustering of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in response to matrix
metalloproteases activity in vitro has been reported,2T1 and T2 MRI cannot yield quantitative information on biological processes.
In this regard, fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), an optical
technique that uses near-infrared (NIR) light, which is weakly absorbed
by the tissue and vasculature, allows for temporal assessment of quantitative
changes to tissue function in live subjects3 and has emerged as a powerful imaging modality.4 FMT has been successfully used to visualize biological
processes such as protease activity in atherosclerosis,5 tumor growth,3 and
skeletal structures.6 Therefore, by combining
MRI with FMT, fluorescence information can be assigned to body compartments,3,7 thereby providing information on biological processes.

Pathologies associated with bone such as Paget’s disease
and osteoporosis involve changes to bone mineral phase (BMP). Hydroxyapatite
(HAp), the mineral phase of bone, is embedded in an organic collagen
matrix. Bone undergoes constant remodeling via crosstalk between osteoclasts
(bone-resorbing cells) and osteoblasts (collagen- and mineral-depositing
cells),8 with 5–10% of bone mass
being renewed annually.9 Deregulation in
this crosstalk can lead to accelerated bone loss as observed in osteoporosis
and cancer metastasis to bone.10 Diagnosis
of early indications of changes to BMP and bone mineral density (BMD)
could help in early detection of bone pathologies. Therefore, imaging
agents that bind to BMP and provide contrast in MRI and FMT can provide
new insights and correlations between BMD and protease activity.

Toward the objective of realizing multimodal polymeric NPs with
affinity to bone, we exploited the known affinity of alendronic acid
(Aln), a
bisphosphonate derivative to BMP.11 Targeting
of anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel to bone using polymers,12 micelles,13 and dendrimers14 through conjugation with bisphosphonate is well
established15 and has been explored for
the treatment of Paget’s disease and osteoporosis.16 In the context of imaging, conjugation with
bisphosphonate derivatives has also been exploited to target scintigraphy
agents, fluorescent probes, radionuclide for positron emission tomography,17,18 and gadolinium chelates for T1-weighted
MRI, which has been discussed in a recent exhaustive review by Cole
et al.19

Because bone pathologies are accompanied by loss of the mineral
phase, they are well suited for T2-weighted
MRI20 as changes in the mineral phase are
expected to also change the water content in the bone.21 Therefore, bone-targeting agents, if properly
designed, not only could serve as a targeted drug delivery system
but also could exploit changes in the bone mineral content, to serve
as a probe to enable early identification of these processes. For T2-weighted MRI, ultrasmall superparamagnetic
iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIONs) are the contrast agent of choice
because they can disrupt the magnetic field within the tissue, providing
dark contrast (negative contrast).22,23 Although the
binding of γ-Fe2O3 NPs modified with a
bisphosphonate derivative to synthetic hydroxyapatite has been reported,24 surprisingly, to date, no T2-contrast agents capable of binding to BMP have been
described.19

The use of USPIONs for imaging tissues can pose a few challenges.
Free USPIONs are rapidly picked up by the cells of the reticuloendothelial
system and show accumulation in the liver, which can lead to potential
hepatic toxicity.25 However, this can be
mitigated by altering the morphology of the USPIONs26 and encapsulating them within a polymer carrier. However,
with respect to marrying USPIONs with bisphosphonate, the chelation
of the phosphate groups with the iron in the USPIONs27 poses a severe limitation in encapsulating USPIONs using
polymers conjugated to bisphosphonate.

In this study,
we present a novel postmodification strategy to overcome this drawback,
thereby synthesizing for the first time polymeric nanoprobes with
high affinity to BMP, which also provide contrast in T2-weighted MRI and the simultaneous visualization of BMP
in NIR optical tomography. We achieved this by exploiting a blending
approach to produce poly(dl-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs stabilized with polyethylene glycol (PEG)
and having chemically accessible N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS) groups on the surface, which upon postfunctionalization with
Aln yielded NPs with a PEG- and Aln-rich surface. These PLGA–PEG/Aln
NPs showed excellent solution stability, high binding capacity to
BMP, and T2-contrast enhancement in MRI.
By incorporating NIR-fluorophore-labeled PLGA in the blending step,
NPs with high affinity for BMP that can be imaged in MRI and optical
modalities has been realized for the first time (Figure 1).

contrast in optical and MRI modalities. Note: VT750 is an NIR dye
that is conjugated to PLGA.

Results and Discussion
NHS–PLGA Surface Functionalized NPs Containing USPIONs
Blending of PLGA with PLGA–PEG block copolymers to produce
NPs with a PEGylated surface has been explored extensively.28,29 NPs bearing Aln on the surface have been prepared by blending PLGA–PEG
with PLGA–PEG–Aln and shown to accumulate in bone in
a multiple myeloma model in
mice.12 Because Aln has high chemical affinity
for oxidized iron and therefore shows chelation towards USPIONs, it
has been exploited to synthesize SPECT/MRI agents.17 We first verified the capacity of the USPIONs to interfere
with NP formation using PLGA–Aln30 (see Materials and Methods for details of
the synthesis) and found that the presence of USPIONs indeed disrupted
NP formation in the nanoprecipitation method.31

The NPs produced in the presence of USPIONs are composed of
large aggregates (size: 890 ± 8 nm, polydispersity index (PDI):
0.23, Figure S1) and as such are too large
for intravenous administration. We therefore postulated that postfunctionalization
approach, wherein Aln is introduced for surface modification after
the NP is formed, could enable the preparation of USPIONs containing
NPs with bone-targeting Aln moieties. This approach would have an
added advantage of allowing tunability of Aln density on the NP surface.
We therefore end-functionalized PLGA with NHS (PLGA–NHS) as
described in Scheme 1A and then blended PLGA–NHS with PLGA–PEG to yield
NPs with a reactive NHS-rich surface. Furthermore, to confer visibility
to the NPs in the NIR spectrum, PLGA modified with the NIR fluorescent
dye VivoTag-750 (VT750) was synthesized starting from PLGA–NHS
using a two-step synthesis as shown in Scheme 1B and incorporated in the blending step.

Scheme 1 (A) Functionalization of PLGA with NHS and (B) Functionalization
of PLGA–NHS with VT750 NIR Dye
The premise behind the incorporation of PLGA–PEG was to
conform stability of the NPs via steric stabilization. However, a
high concentration of PEG chains on the NP surface could diminish
the accessibility and hence the reactivity of Aln to the NHS groups.
Therefore, an optimization study was undertaken to identify the minimum
weight-percentage of PLGA–PEG that would yield NPs with narrow
polydispersity, in a size range that is suitable for intravenous administration
while ensuring stability under serum conditions (Table S1). On the basis of this study, a blend composition
of 80% PLGA–NHS, 15% PLGA–PEG, and 5% PLGA–VT750
(total polymer concentration 5 mg/mL) was deemed optimum because it
yielded NPs below 150 nm with a PDI of less than 0.2. The presence
of a surface rich in NHS groups was confirmed by the charge inversion
of the NP from negative (∼−24 mV) to positive (∼+8
mV) (Table 1), and
this is consistent with the pKa of NHS,
which is 7.8.32 Because the size, PDI,
and surface chemistry of the USPIONs can impact the encapsulation
efficiency, USPIONs were synthesized by thermal decomposition of iron
pentacarbonyl at high temperatures, which yielded particles with an
average size of 5 nm, a narrow PDI, and excellent magnetic properties.26 Furthermore, using this synthesis approach,
the surface of the USPIONs is coated with oleylamine, ensuring that
the particles are stable and dispersible in the polymer solution during
the preparation of the NPs using the nanoprecipitation method.31 The NPs containing USPIONs were prepared using
the blend system, and the uniform distribution of the USPIONs within
the NPs was verified using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
(Figure 2A).

Postmodification of NHS–PLGA NPs Containing USPIONs with
Alendronic Acid
NHS–PLGA NPs encapsulating USPIONs
were first dialyzed against distilled water to remove residual organic
solvents, and the NP suspension was postmodified by mixing with an
aqueous Aln solution (0.2 mg/mL) before it was again dialyzed against
water to remove unbound molecules (Scheme 2). Aln–sodium salt was synthesized
by a previously published method16 with
minor modification, notably substituting PCl5 for PCl3, resulting in a 78% yield, and its structure was verified
using IR, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and 31P NMR spectroscopy (Figure S2).

Scheme 2 Surface Modification of NHS–PLGA NPs with Alendronic Acid
The zeta potential analysis of the NP suspensions post reaction
revealed an inversion of the surface charge from positive to highly
negative (−32.2 ± 1.7), which is consistent with the covalent
linkage of Aln to the NP surface. Importantly, the modification step
had minimal impact on the average size of the NPs, which remained
relatively unchanged with a narrow PDI (163 ± 1 nm, PDI = 0.16),
suggesting that the encapsulated USPIONs did not interfere with the
postmodification with Aln. Further evidence for the presence of Aln
sodium salt was obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis
of lyophilized NPs, where strong signals corresponding to phosphorous
and sodium were observed in addition to iron from the encapsulated
USPIONs (Figure 2B),
whereas in the case of premodified control NPs (PLGA–NHS),
no such peaks were detected (Figure S3).
Additional evidence for the presence of Aln on the NP surface was
gathered from the 31P NMR spectra (Figure 2C), where the presence of a lone phosphorous
peak indicated that a single phosphorous-containing species was present
on the NP, thus effectively excluding nonspecific chemisorption of
Aln during the modification step. In comparison, when the PLGA–PEG/PLGA
NPs were incubated with Aln, no 31P peak was detected,
suggesting that Aln is not adsorbed through electrostatic interactions
but is indeed covalently bound to the NP surface (Figure S4). The postfunctionalized Aln–PLGA NPs were
found to be stable for 7 days even in serum containing cell media
(Figure S5).

Dose-Dependent Binding of Aln–PLGA NPs to Synthetic and
Biogenic HAp
PEG–PLGA NPs, NHS–PLGA NPs, and
Aln–PLGA NPs were incubated with HAp granules for 3 h and analyzed
using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Figure 3A–C). While the PEG–PLGA NPs,
as expected, did not bind to the surface, the NHS–PLGA NPs
showed slight binding towards Hap, which may be attributed to the
affinity between the slightly positively charged surface of the NHS–PLGA
NPs and the negatively charged surface of the HAp granules. However,
the Aln–PLGA NPs showed a remarkable binding capacity to the
HAp surface with a complete coverage of the surface by the NPs (Figure 3C). To understand
the binding behavior, a time course study was undertaken using Aln–PLGA
NPs modified with VT750, and the NP binding was quantified using FMT.
Total fluorescence associated with the NP stock solution was first
quantified within an agarose phantom, and this value was used to determine
the fraction of the adsorbed NPs. A representative FMT volumetric
projection of the HAp granules treated with VT750-labeled Aln–PLGA
NPs and then embedded in an agarose phantom is shown in Figure 3D. It was found that the adsorption
of the Aln–PLGA NPs on the HAp surface showed first-order saturation
kinetics with rapid adsorption in the first hour followed by saturation
in 2–3 h (Figure 3E), with a maximum of ∼8% of the NPs being adsorbed onto the
HAp surface. In comparison, adsorption of PEG–PLGA and NHS–PLGA,
both of which lack Aln, was less than 2% after 3 h. More importantly,
the NPs produced using PLGA premodified with Aln showed poor binding
behavior that was in the same range as the nonspecific controls (NHS-NPs
and PEG-NPs). Furthermore, the binding of the Aln–PLGA NPs,
that is postmodified, was fourfold greater than that of the premodified
NPs after 3 h; this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.023). This proved the validity of our approach that
a postmodification strategy would yield superior outcomes. Furthermore,
the Aln–PLGA NPs binding to the HAp surface was preserved in
the cell culture medium supplemented with serum, which is physiologically
more relevant (Figure S6). The above findings
taken in their totality offer compelling evidence for the postmodification
strategy presented herein. SEM analysis provided further qualitative
evidence for the increased NP binding with longer incubation time
(1–6 h) (Figure S7). The saturation
kinetics suggested that the limiting factor in the adsorption of the
Aln–PLGA NPs onto the HAp surface was the availability of surface
area. Because bone is highly porous, a linear scaling relationship
between NP-associated fluorescence and surface area is necessary for
qualitative analysis. Therefore, the Aln–VT750-labelled Aln–PLGA
NPs were incubated with an increasing amount of HAp granules, which
corresponds to an increase in the surface area, and a linear correlation
was observed up to a 10-fold increase in HAp mass (Figure 3F). This suggests that the
system described herein can be used to quantify bone volume (mass).

Cytocompatibility and Binding Affinity of Aln–PLGA NPs
toward Biogenic HAp
Cytocompatibility of Aln–PLGA–VT-750 NPs
Toxicity of nanomaterials can be a limiting factor in clinical translation.
We therefore investigated the cytocompatibility of the Aln–PLGA
NPs toward osteoblasts because they are responsible for the mineralizing
of mammalian skeletons. Osteoblasts were differentiated from human
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for 21 days, and
their osteogenic lineage was confirmed by the upregulation of mRNA
for type-1 collagen, alkaline phosphate, and bone sialoprotein using
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on day
7 of differentiation and deposition of mineral phase on day 21 of
differentiation (Figure S8). In addition
to osteoblasts, toxicity toward Hepa 1-6, a mouse hepatoma-derived
cell line that is routinely used for screening liver toxicity,26 and mouse macrophages (RAW
264.7) was undertaken. The reason for including macrophages in this
screening was that NPs were cleared from circulation primarily by
macrophages. Cells were incubated with the Aln–PLGA NPs at
different concentrations, ranging from 31 to 500 μg/mL for 24
h, and the cytocompatibility was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromid
(MTT) assay. The Aln–PLGA NPs showed no appreciable toxicity
in all three cell systems at concentrations below 125 μg/mL,
but a small decrease in cell viability was observed at 150 and 500 μg/mL
in all cell types (Figure 4). These data are consistent with the published reports on
NP dose escalation and cell viability.26

Figure 4 Cell viability after 24 h of incubation with increasing concentrations
of Aln–PLGA NPs (31–500 μg/mL).

Binding of Aln–PLGA–VT-750 to Biogenic HAp
Because the mineral deposits within biological environments were
of much smaller dimension and possibly of different chemical composition
than that of synthetic HAp, the ability of the Aln–PLGA NPs
to bind to mineral deposits secreted by osteoblasts was ascertained.
Osteoblasts were differentiated from human MSCs for 21 days, and the
secretion of BMP by the osteoblasts was verified by Alizarin Red staining
(Figure S9). Osteoblasts were incubated
with Aln–PLGA NPs and control NPs (premodified PLGA–Aln)
for 2 h in the presence of serum, and the cells were incubated with
Quin-2, which is an established fluorescent dye used for the visualization
of intracellular and extracellular calcium.33 Fluorescent microscopy revealed that both post- and premodified
NPs (imaged in the 750 nm channel) always co-localized with Quin-2
(480 nm). However, as observed with the binding studies with HAp granules,
Aln–PLGA NPs prepared by postmodification method showed a qualitatively
higher binding to the mineral phases in comparison to that of NPs
prepared by premodification with Aln (Figure 5). Pixel analysis confirmed an 8.4-fold increase
in fluorescent signal (normalized to Quin-2 intensity, i.e., mineral
phase) in the case of postmodified Aln–PLGA NPs versus premodified
NPs, suggesting that for a similar content of mineral phase, a greater
number of NPs were associated in the case of the former. Because the
amount of VT-750 labeled PLGA was the same (5 wt %) in both NP preparations,
this observed enhancement of nearly 1 order of magnitude can be unequivocally
attributed to the higher binding efficiency of the postmodified NPs
to biogenic HAp.

(dark spots) associated with osteoblasts are shown in (D and H) for
comparison. The scale bar is 10 μm.

USPIONSs Containing Aln–PLGA NPs Decrease T2 Relaxation Times in Agarose Phantoms
Having
demonstrated that Aln–PLGA NPs with encapsulated USPIONs possess
favorable cytocompatibility and show high affinity for both synthetic
and biogenic HAp, we ascertained the ability of this system to function
as an MRI T2-contrast agent. The system
performance of NMR and MRI devices are usually tested with phantom
systems.34,35 Agarose is one of the most suitable components
available to fabricate imaging phantoms because it has comparable T2 relaxation times compared with human tissue
(40–150 ms).34Hence, the Aln–PLGA
NPs were first associated with HAp powder and then dispersed in agarose
gelled in an NMR tube to simulate bonelike tissue environment as shown
in Figure 6A. The concentration
of USPIONs in the NPs was varied from 0.07 to 0.35 mmol/L, and water T2 relaxation times were measured using the Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
(CPMG) pulse sequence. USPIONs encapsulated within the Aln–PLGA
NPs affected the transverse T2 relaxation
as a function of the encapsulated amount of iron (Figure 6B). This clear inverse dependence
of T2 with concentration (see Figure S10 for R2 values and r2) suggests that the Aln
surface functionalization does not influence the ability of the encapsulated
USPIONs to provide contrast. Even at a moderate concentration of 0.14
mmol Fe/L, a significant reduction in T2 times of more than 50%, that is, from 78 to 42 ms, was observed
with a further reduction to ∼35 ms at a concentration of 0.21
mmol/L, which stagnated beyond 0.28 mmol/L. These findings confirm
the suitability of Aln–PLGA NPs as the carrier for bone-targeted
MRI contrast agents.

of experimental setup. (B) Water T2 relaxation

Aln–PLGA/VT750 Encapsulating USPIONs Enable Multimodal
Imaging of Bone Environment in MR and NIR Optical Imaging
NIR probes have been successfully used to noninvasively gain information
on biological processes.4,5 Combining the benefits
of NIR imaging with the structural details gained from MRI can offer
new means of correlating biological processes within dense structures
such as bone. Having demonstrated that USPIONs encapsulated in Aln–PLGA
NPs with high affinity toward biogenic HAp can decrease T2 times of water, we investigated the potential of these
novel nanoprobes to provide contrast in T2-weighted MRI and NIR tomography using fresh bovine bone samples
as a model system. Bovine bone samples (dimensions 4 × 2 ×
6 mm3) were immersed partially for 3 h in a solution of
Aln–PGLA NPs modified with VT750 and containing USPIONs. In
this experimental design, the unimmersed half of the bone sample served
as the internal control. The sample was washed four times with deionized
water at 700 rpm to remove unbound NPs and then imaged using μ-computed
tomography (μCT), MRI, and FMT (Figure 7). μCT can clearly distinguish spongy
bone and was used to provide a reference point for the MRI and FMT
image reconstruction. As postulated, a darkening in the MRI image
was found exclusively in the region of the bone sample that was exposed
to the Aln–PLGA NPs, thus confirming the ability of the NPs
to not only bind to the bone tissue but also function as a T2 contrast agent for MRI. The affinity of Aln–PLGA
NPs to the bone was further verified using FMT, where a cumulative
fluorescence of 32 pmol of VT750 was found. This corresponds to a
theoretical amount of 8.7 μg of USPIONs. The ability to gain
information in multiple modalities using these novel bone-targeting
nanoprobes was verified by co-registration of the MRI and FMT data
sets, where a clear overlap between the darkened regions (MRI modality)
and the fluorescence signal (optical modality) was observed.

of the bone sample immersed in the NP solution to the bottom and the
untreated region to the top. The color scale shows the concentration

Conclusions
In this study, by combining a blending approach followed by postmodification
with Aln, polymeric (PLGA) nanoprobes with bone-targeting properties
were synthesized. The postmodification strategy enabled the encapsulation
of USPIONs without interference from Aln. Furthermore, by introducing
an NIR-conjugated PLGA in the blending step, NPs possessing characteristics
that can be interrogated in both MRI (USPIONs) and NIR optical tomography
(NIR-dye) were realized for the first time. These novel multimodal
nanoprobes show affinity to synthetic and biogenic HAp secreted by
osteoblasts and found in spongy bone, and enable the interrogation
of the bone tissue in both T2-weighted
MRI and optical modalities. The multimodal nanoprobes present an important
platform to interrogate the bone environment to understand bone pathologies
and develop bone-targeted therapeutics at an early stage.

VT-750 Functionalization of PLGA–NHS
PLGA–NH2 (0.32 μmol) was diluted in 1 mL acetone. VivoTag-750
(1 mg) was diluted in 100 μL of DMSO and added to PLGA–NHS.
The sample was put on a shaker for 3 h at 700 rpm. The acetone was
removed under reduced pressure. Saturated NaCl (0.4
mL), DCM (2 mL), and water (2 mL) were taken in a 5 mL Eppendorf tube,
and the resultant mixture was shaken thoroughly. The water phase was
removed, and the organic phase washed again with 2 mL of water. This
step was repeated 5 times. The organic phase was dried with MgSO4, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure to yield
PLGA–VT750.

Synthesis of PLGA–NH2 from PLGA–NHS
PLGA–NHS (100 mg, 3.12 μmol) was diluted in 10 mL
of DCM; and then 10 equiv of ethylenediamine was added to the solution
and allowed to react at room temperature (RT) for 3 h. The reaction
mixture was precipitated in cooled diethyl ether, leading to a white
precipitate, which was filtered and washed with diethyl ether. The
filter cake was dried, dissolved in DCM, and reprecipitated in dried
alcohol to remove unreacted amine.

Synthesis of Alendronic Acid
In a 250 mL flask under
argon,
amino butyric acid (0.095 mol) and phosphorous acid (0.095 mol) were
dissolved while stirring at 65 °C in 50 mL of methane sulfonic
acid. After 20 min, 0.2 mol of PCl5 was added. The solution
was stirred under reflux at 65 °C for 22 h. The translucent mixture
obtained was quenched with 200 mL of water under vigorous stirring.
The formation of gas was observed, and the gas was absorbed with NaOH
0.1 mol/L. The reaction mixture was then stirred at reflux at 160
°C for 5 h. The reaction was cooled down using ice-cold water.

The pH in the initial reaction flask (−0.34) was brought
to 1.85 by the addition of 57 mL of NaOH 50% solution. The resulting
solution was added dropwise to 500 mL of methanol, which was cooled
with an ice bath. A white precipitate was formed. The suspension formed
was filtered and washed with 3 × 100 mL of methanol. The resulting
solid was solubilized in water (30 mL) and was poured over 500 mL
of methanol at RT under vigorous agitation. The resulting white suspension
was filtered to yield a white solid (0.074 mol). The remaining solvent
was evaporated in the oven by heating for 1 h at 70 °C followed
by 20 min at 90 °C.

Nanoprecipitation of NHS–PLGA NPs
The NPs were
synthesized using the nanoprecipitation method.31 Briefly, PLGA–VT750, PLGA–PEG, and PLGA–NHS
(5:15:80 w/w %) were dissolved in THF (1 mL) and USPIONs (0.1 mmol/L)
at a fixed mass ratio with a concentration of 5 mg/mL. To the organic
phase an equal amount of water was added rapidly to form the NPs.
The remaining organic solvent was removed by dialysis (MWCO = 50 000/50
kDa), stirring at 200 rpm overnight at RT.

Alendronic Acid Conjugation on the Surface of NHS–PLGA
NPs
Alendronic acid (500 μL, 0.2 mg/mL) was mixed with
500 μL of NHS–PLGA NPs. The sample was shaken for 2 h
at 700 rpm at RT. To remove the unreacted alendronic acid, the sample
was dialyzed overnight against water (MWCO 100 000 kDa).

Synthesis of PLGA–Aln from PLGA–NHS
PLGA–NHS
(10 mg, 0.32 μmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of acetone. Water (5
mL) was slowly added while stirred with a magnetic stirrer. A milky
suspension of NHS–PLGA NPs was obtained. The solvent was removed
by dialysis (MWCO = 50 000/50 kDa) overnight. The NHS–PLGA
NPs were diluted with water to reach a concentration of 0.25 mg/mL.
Alendronic acid (1 mL; 0.1 mg/mL) was added dropwise to the NP suspension
while stirring. The NPs started to aggregate, indicating the formation
of an amide bond between alendronic acid and PLGA–NHS. The
reaction was stirred for 2 h at RT. The precipitate was centrifuged
(2000 rpm), and the supernatant was discharged. The precipitate was
dissolved in DCM and again precipitated in diethyl ether. To remove
the unreacted alendronic acid, the sample was again dialyzed overnight
against water (MWCO 100 000 kDa), which yielded PLGA–Aln.
The resulting PLGA–Aln was used for the control experiments.

Cell Culture
Hepa 1-6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(P/S) (100 U/mL; PAN-Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany). Human MSCs,
a gift from Prof. Ivan Martin (University Hospital Basel Reference
Number of local ethical committee 78/07), were differentiated into
osteoblasts for 21 days with modified eagle’s medium (α-MEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, l00 μg/mL
streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 5 ng/mL basic
fibroblast growth factor, 10 nM dexamethasone, 0.1 mM l-ascorbic
acid-2-phosphate, and 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate. Osteoblast
differentiation was tested after 7 days with RT-qPCR and after 21
days with Alizarin Red-S staining. Mouse macrophages (RAW 267.4, Sigma
Aldrich, Germany) were cultured in a Roswell Park Memorial Institute
medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% P/S (100 U/mL;
PAN-Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany). All cells were maintained in
a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Cellular Metabolic Activity Assessment
MTT is an assay
used to investigate the mitochondrial activity of cells. Cells were
exposed to the MTT dye (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide), which transforms into insoluble purple formazan crystals.
After exposure, the crystals were dissolved in DMSO, and the absorbance
at 530 nm was measured in a plate reader (Synergy II, BioTek Instruments,
Inc.). The amount of transformed MTT is proportional to the metabolic
activity and can therefore be used to determine the effect of particles
on the cell viability. We seeded 20 × 103 cells per
well in a 96-well plate and allowed them to attach overnight. On the
following day, the supernatant was replaced with media containing
Aln–PLGA NPs in different concentrations (31, 62, 125, 250,
and 500 μg/mL). After 24 h of incubation, cell viability was
investigated with the protocol provided by the supplier (Invitrogen).
Untreated cells served as controls for the experiment.

Osteogenic Differentiation of Human MSCs
MSCs were
differentiated to osteoblasts for 21 days with α-MEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, l00 μg/mL
streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 5 ng/mL basic
fibroblast growth factor, 10 nM dexamethasone, 0.1 mM l-ascorbic
acid-2-phosphate, and 10 mM β-glycerol-phosphate. Osteoblast
differentiation was tested after 7 days with RT-qPCR and after 21
days with Alizarin Red-S staining.

Alizarin Red-S Staining
After three weeks, the cell
layer in the petri dish was washed with PBS for 3 times, fixed for
10 min in 3.7% formalin at RT, stained with Alizarin Red 2% for 20
min, and washed with tap water. Human MSCs were able to mineralize
the matrix abundantly after 3 weeks of culture in osteogenic medium,
as demonstrated by a strong Alizarin Red-S staining.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
To determine the size
and the presence of USPIONs in the polymeric NPs TEM was used [Zeiss
LEO 912 Omega (Leo Elektronenmikroskopie GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany)].
An aliquot of Aln–PLGA NPs in water was placed on a carbon
grid. After removing the solvent, the samples were analyzed using
an electron acceleration of 120 keV.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM micrographs were obtained
using a Quanta 250 FEG (FEI). The dried HAp samples (Finceramica)
after incubation with the Aln–PLGANPs were placed on a carbon
grid and coated with gold to visualize under high-resolution under
reduced pressure. For elemental analysis (EDX), an Oxford INCA x-act
(Oxford Instruments, UK) was used. The samples were analyzed using
the software INCA.

Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
FTIR
spectra were recorded on a Vector 22 instrument (Bruker Optics), and
the software provided by the manufacturer was used to import and analyze
the spectrum.

Dynamic Light Scattering
The particle size was analyzed
using dynamic light scattering with a Delsa Nano C (Beckman Coulter
Inc., USA) provided with a laser diode operating at 658 nm. Measurements
were conducted at a scattering angle of θ = 165° to the
incident beam. Samples were equilibrated at 25 °C for at least
30 min prior to the analysis. The data were processed using CONTIN
algorithms with Delsa Nano UI Software version 3.73. The size and
PDI were expressed as the average of at least three measurements (±standard
deviation).

Surface Charge Measurements
A Delsa Nano C (Beckman
Coulter Inc., USA) analyzer was used to measure ζ potential
values. The ζ potential of the particles in aqueous suspension
(1:9 dilution with deionized H2O) was obtained by measuring
the electrophoretic movement of charged particles under an applied
electric field. Scattered light was detected at a 30° angle at
25 °C.

T2 Measurements
A Bruker
Avance 300 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker Biosciences
Corp., Billerica, MA) with a CPMG sequence was used to measure T2 relaxation times. The USPIONs containing the
Aln NPs were incubated with 20 mg HAp powder for 3 h at RT. The supernatant
was removed, and the samples were washed 5 times with 0.2 mL of double-distilled
deionized water. The samples were then dried under reduced pressure
for 6 h. A 2% w/v agarose solution prepared in deionized water was
heated to 90 °C to form a solution, and while cooling it down,
20 mg HAp mixed with 0.7 mL of agarose was added to the solution in
an NMR-tube (180 × 5 mm2), following which the suspension
was gelled by placing it on ice. The NMR data were processed using
Top Spin 3.2 software (Bruker), and Dynamic Center 2.1.8 was used
to calculate T2 relaxation times.

Microscopy
For fluorescence microscopy, cells were
seeded in 8-well chamber slides. Following incubation of the osteoblasts
with Aln–PLGA NPs for 2 h, the cells were washed three times
with PBS to remove unbound and weakly bound NPs, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) nuclear stain, fixed with paraformaldehyde 3.7% (v/v) for 15
min, mounted onto coverslips, and then imaged using the Zeiss cell
observer Z1. The images of the NPs (750 channel) were exported and
analyzed using pixel analysis from ImageJ to compare the amount of
NPs (pre- and postmodified) bound on the calcium deposits.

FMT Imaging
After incubation with fluorescence-labeled
NPs, the Hap (Osteoporon) was dried under reduced pressure and sealed
in a plastic tube 3.0 × 18.0 mm2, which was placed
in an agarose phantom (1% in Milli-Q water). Samples were analyzed
with an FMT 2500 (Perkin-Elmer) using the 750 nm channel (excitation
745 nm, emission 770–800 nm). Reflectance images were analyzed
using a TrueQuant 3D (Perkin-Elmer, version 2.2.0.24).

Image Co-registration
μCT volumes (isometric
voxel size: 0.0844 μm; 908 × 428 pixel, 500–1200
slices) and FMT volumes were imported into AMIDE (64-bit v. 1.0.4).
The volumes were corrected for axial rotations and co-registered based
on the reflectance images from FMT. The co-registered datasets were
exported in DICOM format and imported into Osirix (v. 5.5.1, 64-bit),
where the image volumes were synchronized, fused, and visualized using
3D volume rendering.

MRI
A commercially available mousehead 2-element quadrature
cryogenic coil system with a 7 T Bruker BioSpec small horizontal animal
scanner (bore size 20 cm, maximum gradient amplitude 676 mT/m) was
used to adapt MR pulse sequences with respect to bone sample imaging.
The standard setup, designed for imaging live mice, was modified by
the addition of a 3D printed sample holder made of polylactic acid
(PLA). Bone samples incubated with NPs (spongiosa, 4 × 2 ×
6 mm3) were then inserted into a poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) container (height 3 mm) filled with saline solution and sealed
on one side with an adhesive PCR tape. For imaging, a 3D FLASH sequence
was applied with TR (40 ms), TE (6.2 ms), flip angle (50°), averages
(1), BW (50 000 Hz), Cryocoil, pulse length (1.400 ms), BW
(3000.0 Hz) and a physical resolution of 39 × 38 × 94 μm3, and the imaging was obtained in 22 min. The binding of the
NPs on the bone samples was subsequently compared with the findings
in FMT microscopy and μCT.

μCT Imaging
Bovine bone samples were scanned
using a SkyScan 1178 (SkyScan, Belgium; version 1.3) high-speed in
vivo micro-CT imager over an angle of 180° with rotation steps
of 1° at a resolution of 83 μm and a field of view of 86
mm. Each image was acquired at 65 kV and 615 μA with an average
of three frames. Using the NRecon module (SkyScan 2010, v. 6.3.3),
the data sets underwent postalignment, beam-hardening correction,
and ring-artifact reduction (a parameter set with the integrated fine-tuning
tool), and the 3D reconstructions were exported in a DICOM format
and presented as a 3D image in OsiriX v. 5.5.1.

Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was performed
using Student’s t-test (paired, type 2, and
2-tailed) in Microsoft Excel, and p-values < 0.05
were considered statistically significant. All values are presented
as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
