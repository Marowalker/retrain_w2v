Ag/Co3O4 catalysts using three different modes of solution
combustion synthesis were developed and characterized by X-ray diffraction,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
transmission electron microscopy to identify crystallite size, oxidation
state, composition, and morphology. Cyclic voltammetry and linear
sweep voltammetry measurements for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) confirm the bifunctionality of
the electrocatalysts. The electrochemical evaluation indicates that
a synergic effect between Ag and Co enhances the activity through
the fast breaking of O–O bond in the molecular oxygen to enhance
the reduction mechanism. The high content of cobalt (Co) in the catalyst
Ag/Co3O4-12, synthesized by second wave combustion,
improves the activity for ORR, and the reaction mechanism follows
a 3.9 number of electron transfer in overall reaction. The kinetic
and limiting current densities of Ag/Co3O4-12
are maximum when compared to those of other Ag/Co3O4 catalysts and are very close to commercial Pt/C. Moreover,
the maximum current density of OER for Ag/Co3O4-12 makes it a promising candidate for various bifunctional electrocatalytic
applications such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries.

Introduction
Energy conversion electrochemical
technologies such as polymer electrolyte fuel cells and metal–air
batteries show highly efficient performance based on the oxygen catalyst
in the reaction mechanism.1−5 Platinum (Pt) has been recognized as the most efficient catalyst
for anode and cathode of the fuel cells.6−10 However, its high cost and availability limit its use, and it is
an urgent task to find the replacement of Pt with readily available
and cheaper ones. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) are cathodic and anodic reaction techniques that are
applicable for fuel cells, water splitting, and CO2 reduction
and in energy-storage solar fuel synthesis.11−14 Precious metals such as Pt, Ru,
and Ir are well-known OER catalysts with moderate overpotential.15 It is reported that RuO2 is thermodynamically
unstable, whereas Pt and Ir cause agglomeration in the atomic scale,
which prevents them to act as bifunctional catalysts over time.16,17 It is challenging to introduce a bifunctional oxygen catalyst for
both ORR and OER.17−20

A bimetallic catalyst shows distinct physical and chemical
properties that differ from its monometallic catalyst because of the
high synergy between the individual metals.21 The bimetals of transition metals has different applications in
the field of catalysis, batteries, and solar energy conversion by
the presence of hybrid sites and its concomitant functionalities.22−28 Bimetallic catalysts have the exciting tuning properties to enhance
the reaction pathway. Previous studies have reported on the extensive
behavior of bimetals in catalysis, which possess unique properties
strongly associated with their intrinsic electronic or geometric structures.24,29−32 Effective oxygen reduction catalyst with high activity and low cost
remains a great challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis
of bifunctional catalysts that are active for ORR and OER suitable
to be used in fuel cells and water electrolysis-related applications.

Silver (Ag) shows high activity, better tolerance, stability, and
longer performance for ORR mechanism.33,34 The weaker
Ag–O2 interaction
results in a stronger O–O bond that causes difficulty in breaking
the bond of the electrolyte. Therefore, the Ag–O interaction
must be stronger to enhance the electrochemical activity of the catalyst
and consequently increases the kinetics of ORR. This can be achieved
by incorporating the cheaper metals along with Ag. Cobalt (Co) is
a better option because of its low cost, electrical resistance, and
corrosion-free nature in basic medium. An active Co3+ site
in Co3O4 shows great performance in ORR. The
high interaction of adsorbed oxygen with Ag in the Ag–Co/C
particle increases the ORR activity by rupturing the O–O bond.
Also, the adsorption of oxygen to Ag from the well-oxidized Co3O4 results in increase in the oxygen transport
rate. Lin et al. reported that the presence of Co in Au–Co
for ORR changes the electronic structure of the gold.35 Wang et al. reported on the hydrothermal method of the
synthesis of Ag–C, Co3O4–C, and
Ag/Co3O4–C and compared the monometal
and bimetal effect in the catalytic activity.36

We followed a fast, simple, and single-step solution combustion
synthesis (SCS) resulted with the preparation of a wide range of nanoparticles
(NPs) of high surface area and porosity in cost-effective way.37,38 SCS mode is based on the redox reaction between the oxidizing agent
(metal nitrate) and the fuel (e.g., urea, glycine, and hydrazine).
The fuels mostly used are sources of carbon and hydrogen that are
ideally highly water-soluble cyclic and linear organic amines and
amino acids with low decomposition temperature.39 The exothermic reactions between the reactive group (NH3) of fuel and nitric acid (HNO3) from metal nitrate
are the primary source of energy to initiate the combustion mode.
Hydrogen-rich atmosphere formed during combustion determines the phase
of the resulted NPs
whether it is pure metal (H2 rich) or its oxides (H2 lean), which results in the formation of NPs with a high
crystalline structure without any postthermal treatments such as calcination.40,41 It is possible to synthesize various metals, metal oxides, metal
sulfides, and alloys with different properties and dimensions through
the precise control of specific fuel and the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio.42−44 The large amount of gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and
water formed during the combustion causes the significant expansion
of gaseous product and reduces the temperature after reduction that
would help in the formation of finely dispersed porous nanostructures.45,46 Manukyan and co-workers studied the mechanism of SCS for the synthesis
of nanocrystalline metallic materials using different in situ techniques.47 They found the effect of fuel-to-oxidizer ratio
on the transformation of metal oxides to metals and vice versa. The
stoichiometric equation and the mechanism behind the combustion synthesis
of NP were reported in our previous work.48,49 In this work, we first propose a single-step combustion synthesis
of Ag/Co3O4 through three different modes, which
shows good ORR and OER response in basic medium.

Results and Discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate the phases of the synthesized
Ag/Co3O4 catalysts (Figure 1). In all the three synthesis modes, Ag is
in metallic form, whereas Co is present in the form of its oxides
(CoO and Co3O4). Ag/Co3O4-12 and Ag/Co3O4-21 show the presence of both
CoO and Co3O4, but in Ag/Co3O4-11, Co is present only in the higher oxidation state (Co3O4). The presence of cubic-structured Co3O4 (PDF#43-1003) can be observed at 31.28°, 36.6°,
59.21°, and 65.32° along with the presence of CoO in Ag/Co3O4-12 and Ag/Co3O4-21 compounds
at 43.54°. Likewise, the presence of Ag(111), Ag(200), Ag(220),
and Ag(331) can be identified with the peaks located at 38.2°,
44.3°, 64.6°, and 77.6°, respectively.36 The formation of CoO in Ag/Co3O4-12
and Ag/Co3O4-21 samples could be due to the
second wave of combustion where additional fuel is added to synthesize
the second phase that could partially reduce Co3O4 to CoO as reported earlier.49

of three synthesis modes of Ag–Co using combustion synthesis.

The absorption spectrum of monometallic
Ag NP gave the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 470 nm (Figure 2a). Co shows that
two SPR peaks centered at lower band (540 nm) are associated with
O2– to Co2+ and those centered at higher
band (800 nm) correspond to O2– to Co3+ transition.50,51 Ag/Co3O4 showing one absorption peak at the lower band in the region between
the resonance peak of monometals Ag and Co clearly indicates the formation
of an Ag–Co NP alloy not only a mixture of Ag and Co NPs. In
Ag/Co3O4-12, the lower resonance peak was observed
at 450 nm with a clear blue shift when compared to Ag/Co3O4-11 and Ag/Co3O4-21. The blue
shift in Ag/Co3O4-12 could be due to the strong
quantum confinement effect that shifts the energy levels of conduction
and valence bands with decrease in particle size.52

Figure 2 (a) UV–visible absorption spectrum of monometallic and bimetallic
Ag–Co. (b–d) Tauc plot to determine the optical band
gap in Ag/Co3O4-11, Ag/Co3O4-12, and Ag/Co3O4-21.

The optical band gap for the bimetallic Ag–Co was
calculated based on the Tauc equation 1  where h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency of the
vibration, A is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor, and n is a constant, which is 1/2 for a direct transition or
2 for an
indirect transition. The Tauc plot (Figure 2b–d) corresponds to two band gap values:
the lower band gap value is assigned to d–d spin-allowed transition
between Co3+ and Co2+ ion and the higher band
gap value is originated from p–d charge transfer within Co3+ and O2– in Co3O4.50,53−55 The dual band gap is
the possibility of interband transition in spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4). Ag/Co3O4-12 holds a
larger band gap value of 1.23 eV possibly because of the quantum particle
size confinement that makes the conduction and valence band shifts
apart.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum shows the
absorbance spectrum of monometal and bimetals of Ag–Co (Figure 3). The vibration
in the range of 400–700 cm–1 generally corresponds
to metal–oxygen bonding. The vibration spectrum for Ag in this
range gets flattened because of the presence of Ag in pure metallic
form without any kind of oxygen bonding present in it or because of
the possible sintering at higher temperature with increase in fuel
ratio.56,57 In Co spectrum, the two absorption peaks
at 652 and 549 cm–1 originate from the stretching
vibration of the Co–O bond where Co2+ (3d7) is tetrahedrally coordinated at 653 cm–1 and
Co3+ (3d6) is octahedrally coordinated at 550
cm–1 confirming the presence of spinel Co3O4.58,59 The peak at 1043 cm–1 corresponds to the characteristic vibration of surface bidentate
carbonate from the gaseous CO2 that interacts between the
lattice oxygen present in spinel Co3O4.60,61

Figure 3 FTIR
absorbance spectrum of Ag/Co3O4 catalysts prepared
using the SCS technique.

The weak absorption peak at 835 cm–1 is
attributed to the twisting vibrations of unburned carbonyl impurity
(O–C≡O) from the unburned fuel.62 The absorption band of Ag/Co3O4-11 is similar
to pure Co but with reduced peak intensity, indicating the reduction
in the amount of Co on the surface. In Ag/Co3O4-12, the peak and its intensities are exactly matching with monometallic
Co3O4, which confirms the predominant phase
of Co on the surface of the catalyst. The vibration peaks in Ag/Co3O4-21 tend to merge together, and diminishing the
peak intensity could be due to the presence of more metallic Ag. The
peaks corresponding to the spinel Co3O4 exist
because of the presence of Co with higher molar ratio (1:1.83) in
the overall composition.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images display the microstructure of the three synthesized samples
(Figure 4). In all
the three cases, a typical structure of SCS-synthesized nanomaterials
with porous surface composed of agglomerated NPs is observed. Synthesis
conditions tend to affect the particle size and porosity obtained
during the SCS process, and a detailed discussion can be found in
previously reported articles on the synthesis of Cu–Ni48 and Co49 nanopowders.
Ag/Co3O4-11 nanopowder indicates a broad size
distribution with smaller particles dispersed over large size particles
(Figure 4a). Ag/Co3O4-12 compound shows a similar microstructure with
larger agglomerated particles (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 SEM images of the Ag–Co nanopowders synthesized
using the SCS technique: (a) Ag/Co3O4-11, (b)
Ag/Co3O4-12, and (c) Ag/Co3O4-21.

Ag/Co3O4-21 shows a more uniform size distribution of smaller NPs
that agglomerate to form a porous structure (Figure 4c). At this stage, it is difficult to identify
Ag and Co from each other; however, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) results (Figure 5) indicate Ag particles to be smaller in size as compared to Co in
all the three samples. A relatively better control on Ag NP size was
observed as compared to Co NPs.

Figure 5 TEM images of the as-synthesized NPs and
their corresponding lattice fringes at high magnification for (a,d)
Ag/Co3O4-11, (b,e) Ag/Co3O4-12, and (c,f) Ag/Co3O4-21.

TEM images of three Ag–Co NPs are presented
in Figure 5. On the
basis of their phase contrast, the Ag NPs (Ag atomic weight = 107.8682)
are expected to appear darker as compared to Co (Co atomic weight
= 58.933). NPs are found to be agglomerated in all the three samples;
nonetheless, Ag NPs seem to be well dispersed in Ag/Co3O4-11 (Figure 5a,d) and Ag/Co3O4-21 (Figure 5c,f) samples as compared to
Ag/Co3O4-12 (Figure 5b,e). Agglomeration is reported to be a common
challenge in SCS-synthesized samples,48,49,63 and in the case of Ag/Co3O4, Ag NPs seem to be relatively less affected as compared to Co, possibly
because they are smaller in size and anchored to Co NPs. For Ag/Co3O4-11, isolated Ag particles in the range of 8–15
nm size are distributed over the larger cobalt oxide particles (Figure 5a). In the case of
Ag/Co3O4-12, Ag particles are expected to be
partially/fully covered by Co particles that are synthesized in the
second combustion wave (Figure 5b), whereas in the case of Ag/Co3O4-21
(Figure 5c), Co particles
are synthesized first and Ag particles are deposited on the Co surface.
A size distribution study indicates that Ag NPs are in the range of
7–14 nm.

High-resolution TEM images indicating lattice
fringes (Figure 5d–f)
confirm that NPs are highly crystalline in nature. Fast Fourier transform
(FFT) analysis of Ag NPs in Ag/Co3O4-11 samples
(Figure 5d) indicates
an atomic plane spacing of 0.235 nm correlating with (111) lattice
planes of Ag crystals, which is in good agreement with XRD data (Figure 1). This indicates
the presence of Ag(111) planes having face-centered cubic structures.64 FFT analysis on Co crystals indicates the presence
of Co3O4 with lattice spacings of 0.286 and
0.25 nm corresponding to the (220) and (311) crystal planes. In Ag/Co3O4-21 (Figure 5e), it is difficult to analyze the lattice spacing
of Ag NPs, whereas Co-oxide crystals’ plane spacings of 0.28
and 0.212 nm corresponding to Co3O4(220) and
CoO(200) planes are seen65 and found in
the phases as detected by XRD. Ag/Co3O4-21 shows
the presence of Ag(111) and Co3O4(220) crystal
planes66 (Figure 5e).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to identify the surface composition and oxidation states
of metals in the catalysts synthesized via different modes (Figure 6). A survey scan
(not shown) was conducted to identify the elements present in the
samples indicating Ag, Co, O, and C without any other impurities.
The Ag XPS spectra (Ag 3d) show the higher content of Ag in Ag/Co3O4-21 and Ag/Co3O4-11 than
that in Ag/Co3O4-12 (Figure 6a). This result is expected as in the case
of Ag/Co3O4-12, Co synthesis was carried out
on the surface of Ag, leading to a higher content of Co on the surface
that reduces the content of surface Ag. Ag spectrum shows the two
peaks of Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 at 368.1 and
374.1 eV, respectively, with an orbital spin splitting of about 6.1
eV denoting the presence of metallic form of Ag67 (Figure 6b). There was no apparent shift in the binding energy of Ag in any
of the samples, indicating that there is no change in surface Ag oxidation
state because of second wave combustion synthesis (SWCS). The XPS
spectra for Co 2p do indicate an increase in surface Co present in
the Ag/Co3O4-12 sample (Figure 6c). Surface Co content is anticipated to
be higher in the case of Ag/Co3O4-12 as most
of Co will be synthesized on the surface of Ag in SWCS.

Figure 6 XPS spectra
comparison for all the samples and the detailed study on individual
elements: (a,b) Ag 3d, (c,d) Co 2p, and (e,f) O 1s.

On the basis of the XPS peak, the Co surface atomic
concentration in three samples decreases as Ag/Co3O4-12 > Ag/Co3O4-21 > Ag/Co3O4-11, whereas in the case of Ag, the content on
surface followed a trend of Ag/Co3O4-21 ≈
Ag/Co3O4-11 > Ag/Co3O4-12. This trend in Co and Ag surface content can be explained in
the light of surface carbon content. The presence of carbon is expected
in SCS samples because glycine is used as a fuel, and in many cases,
complete combustion and removal of carbon are not observed. A quantitative
analysis of surface carbon shows the atomic concentration of 29.98,
17.93, and 16.93% for Ag/Co3O4-11, Ag/Co3O4-21, and Ag/Co3O4-12, respectively.
The results indicate that a decrease in carbon content in SWSC could
be due to the possibility of further combustion of carbon in the second
wave of SWCS and subsequent rearrangement of elements on the surface.
A higher content of surface carbon in the Ag/Co3O4-11 sample indicates a lower total metallic content of (Ag + Co)
as compared to that in other two samples. This could be the reason
why a similar amount of surface Ag is present in Ag/Co3O4-21 and Ag/Co3O4-11, whereas Ag/Co3O4-21 has a higher amount of Co as compared to
the Ag/Co3hasO4-11 sample. A detailed study
by deconvoluting Co 2p peak to estimate the distribution of oxidation
states shows the presence of +3 cations at two peaks of 780.2 eV (2p3/2) and 795.6 eV (2p1/2) with a separation of 15.6
eV between them68 (Figure 6d). Also, the less dominant satellite peaks
at 789.5 and 804.5 eV further confirm the existence of Co3+ cations.69 Likewise, the weak peaks identified
after the curve fitting at 782.4 and 796.8 eV confirm the coexistence
of Co4+ in the measured sample. The surface analysis of
elemental oxygen in all the three modes displays the presence of higher
content of oxygen in Ag/Co3O4-12 and an overall
trend of Ag/Co3O4-12 > Ag/Co3O4-21 ≈ Ag/Co3O4-11 (Figure 6e). This could be because of
the oxygen being linked with Co atoms to form cobalt oxide over the
surface. The O 1s spectrum (Figure 6f) shows the presence of a strong peak at 529.6 eV
corresponding to the presence of oxygen in M–O bond (M metal)
and a less dominant peak after the curve fitting at 532.5 eV indicating
the adsorbed oxygen in the surface.70

The electrocatalytic activity of the Ag/Co3O4 catalyst synthesized via different schemes has been examined with
cyclic voltammetry (CV) to test the bifunctionality in N2- (Figure 7a)/O2-saturated (Figure 7b) 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. The ORR activity was assessed by comparing the two CVs in O2-saturated electrolytes. The complete electrocatalytic activity
of Ag–Co (ORR and OER) includes the redox reaction that involves
the oxidation of Ag and reduction of Ag oxides. The redox reaction
peaks (Figure 7a) at
0.87 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (A2) and
0.85 V versus NHE (C2) are due to the formation and reduction
of AgO,71 respectively, that can be represented
as follows: 2  

Figure 7 CV
for Ag/Co3O4-11/C, Ag/Co3O4-12/C, and Ag/Co3O4-21/C catalysts in (a) N2-saturated and (b) O2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte
at 0.05 V s–1 in a wide potential range to demonstrate
the ORR and OER performance. The arrow indicates the scan direction.

The second pair of redox reaction
peaks at A1 and C1 at 0.7–0.75 V and
around 0.5–0.6 V is attributed to the formation and reduction
of Ag2O72 as represented below 3  

The redox reactions A2 and C2 are same
for all the three types of catalysts, whereas A1 and C1 are different. A clear shift of C1 in the cathodic
direction is visible toward a negative potential in the order of 0.58,
0.54, and 0.51 V for Ag/Co3O4-21/C, Ag/Co3O4-11/C, and Ag/Co3O4-12/C,
respectively, is due to the strong interaction of the absorbed oxygenated
species and highest for Ag/Co3O4-12 when compared
to other catalysts could be due to the presence of more Co species
over the surface.73 The extra reduction
peak of C3 in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolyte
(Figure 7b) is due
to the ORR. The cathodic reaction on Ag/Co3O4-12/C is positively shifted by 0.208 in comparison with Ag/Co3O4-11/C and Ag/Co3O4-21/C.
As reported before, the electrochemical activity has been enhanced
through the ligand mechanism of charge transfer between the catalyst
metals where the Co particles perturb the active sites of Ag NPs.74,75 The catalytic activities of all the samples were obtained using
the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement at a speed range of
400–1600 rpm in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution
(Figure 8a). The activity
of the catalyst was determined by the half-wave potential of the ORR
curve. The positive shift on the onset potential is more on Ag/Co3O4-12/C in comparison with that on Ag/Co3O4-11/C and Ag/Co3O4-21/C, and the
calculated limiting current density on Ag/Co3O4-12/C is greater than that of other two Ag–Co catalysts but
lower than that of standard Pt/C. Ag/Co3O4-12/C
shows comparable kinetics with Pt/C. The limiting diffusion current
density in the disk increases with the increase in rotation speed
for the Ag/Co3O4-12/C catalyst (Figure 8b). This expected trend is
due to the decrease in diffusion barrier that enables an easy pathway
for the passage of electrons at high speed.

Figure 8 (a) Rotating disk electrode I–V polarization curve (potential V vs NHE) in O2-saturated 1 M KOH at 1600 rpm
for different Ag–Co alloys synthesized with SCS at a scan rate
of 5 mV s–1 (−0.6 to 1.2 V vs NHE), (b) LSV
performance of Ag/Co3O4-12/C at different rotation
rates from 1600 to 400 rpm 1 (−0.2 to 0.9 V vs NHE), (c) KL
plot for ORR at 0.15 V (inset—bar plot shows the kinetic current
density and the number of electron transfer in each catalyst), and
(d) bifunctional ORR and OER performance of different catalysts.

Levich plot shows (Figure 8c) the electron transfer that
occurs in the overall ORR. The number of electrons transferred is
independent of the rotation speed, but they are greatly influenced
by the catalytic material used and the reaction environment. The number
of electron transfer (n) calculated from the Levich
line slope of the catalyst by eq 7 is explained earlier. It is observed that Ag/Co3O4-12/C results in the transfer of 3.9 electrons, whereas
Ag/Co3O4-11/C and Ag/Co3O4-21/C are involved in 3.7 and 3.8 electron exchange, respectively,
at a potential of 0.15 V. The inset bar plot shows the kinetic current
density in which Ag/Co3O4-12/C has the value
very close to standard Pt/C. The bifunctionality of the Ag–Co
catalyst shows the anodic current (OER) and cathodic current (ORR)
for the RDE–LSV experiment at 1600 rpm (Figure 8d). It was observed that all the samples
possess a characteristic peak centered between 0.7 and 1 V NHE, which
are attributed to the oxidation of lower state Ag species formed during
the linear sweep.76 These metal oxidations
provide active centers with higher valences that could help to improve
the OER. In OER, Ag/Co3O4-12/C has higher anodic
current than the other two catalysts. This suggests the rapid transfer
of electrons between the electrolyte and the catalyst. An increase
in the catalytic activity of the electrochemical reaction for Ag/Co3O4-12/C is evident from all the above results.
The presence of Co3O4 and CoO in the sample
is mentioned in the XRD (Figure 1) and TEM (Figure 5) analyses, respectively. Cobalt oxide network formed
over Ag particles increases the binding energy to the oxygen adsorbed
and facilitates the O–O bond splitting.73 Also, the oxygen adsorbed on Co3O4 is transferred to the adjacent Ag particles and gets reduced there.
Likewise, if the rate of oxygen transport to the Ag is higher in Ag/Co3O4-12/C, it will increase the activity in the ORR
and OER.

Tafel plot has proved another way to analyze the electrocatalytic
activity and reaction mechanism of electrocatalysts. Mass-transfer-corrected
Tafel plot is obtained from the log(JK) versus V, where JK is the kinetic current density calculated from the modified Koutecky–Levich
(KL) eq 6 as shown below: 4  where J and JL are the
measured current and mass-corrected limiting current, respectively.
Two different linear Tafel slopes were noticed at low and higher overpotentials
in each catalyst. Lower slope at lower potential and a slope with
larger values at higher overpotential corresponding to Temkin isotherm
and Langmuir isotherm are preferred
for better reduction mechanism.77 Tafel
slopes (Figure 9a)
for Ag/Co3O4-11/C, Ag/Co3O4-12/C, and Ag/Co3O4-21/C are in the order of
35, 29, and 30 mV dec–1, respectively, for higher
potential and 79, 85, and 81 mV dec–1 for lower
potential. Lower Tafel slope for Ag/Co3O4-12/C
when compared with other catalysts indicates the fast transport of
electrons between the catalyst and the electrolyte. The catalytic
efficiency was identified by calculating the exchange current density78 using the equation shown below 5  where η is the overpotential, b the Tafel
slope, J the current density, and Jex the exchange current density. The exchange current
density Jex values for Ag/Co3O4-11/C, Ag/Co3O4-12/C, and Ag/Co3O4-21/C are 2.7 × 10–5 A/cm–2 (5.5 × 10–4 A/cm–2), 1.06 × 10–4 A/cm–2 (4.2
× 10–3 A/cm–2), and 4.4 ×
10–5 A/cm–2 (1.3 × 10–3 A/cm–2), respectively, for high
overpotentials (low overpotential). Jex provides a strong evidence showing that Ag/Co3O4-12/C is more sensible for the electric current response with the
potential and a promising catalyst for the ORR reaction. Tafel plot
for OER corresponding to the three Ag–Co catalysts with the
smallest slope for Ag/Co3O4-12/C displays better
catalytic performance for the water electrolysis reaction (OER) to
generate oxygen (Figure 9b). Overall, the Ag/Co3O4-12/C catalyst shows
the best performance for OER and ORR among the three catalysts tested.
Bard and co-workers reported the hypothesis for enhancing the ORR
in Ag–Co/C as the ability of breaking O–O bond and the
adsorbed O atom was migrated to Ag that causes electroreduction.79 This is more evident from the shifting of Ag
oxide reduction peak in CV toward lower potential (Figure 7) for Ag/Co3O4-12/C compared to other two Ag/Co3O4 catalysts, which is attributed to the stronger interaction of absorbed
oxygen with active Ag sites. This high activity could be ascribed
to its synergic coupling between the monometals and a fast charge
transport in it. The current state-of-the-art of some selected Ag–Co-modified
electrodes in terms of onset potential and limiting current densities
was compared with Ag/Co3O4 combustion synthesis
catalyst (Table 1).

Conclusions
Ag–Co catalysts with three different compositions were synthesized
by combustion-based techniques. These NPs were applied for ORR and
OER in alkaline medium. Among the three catalysts, the catalyst with
high content of Co in Ag/Co3O4-12/C displayed
better performance for electrocatalytic ORR and OER. In general, the
presence of Co oxide on the surface of the Ag/Co3O4-12/C catalyst is anticipated to enhance the adsorption and
transport of oxygen involved in ORR. The Ag atoms in the catalyst
activate the O–O bond splitting and increase the reaction kinetics
of ORR. High performance for OER can be achieved because of the presence
of more active centers with high valence that was generated through
the metal oxidation of Ag. All the three catalysts were found to follow
the four-electron transfer mechanism for ORR. The catalytic activity
of Ag/Co3O4-12/C for ORR was confirmed with
low Tafel slope and lower exchange current density at high potential
and high exchange density and larger Tafel slope at lower potentials.
Therefore, it can be concluded that Ag/Co3O4-12/C is a promising catalyst for the application of fuel cell and
water electrolysis owing to the presence of more Co atoms on the surface
that promote the transfer of oxygen to Ag where it is reduced by releasing
electrons.

Experimental Section
Catalyst Synthesis
All the catalysts
in this work were synthesized using the SCS technique. The detailed
synthesis procedure is outlined in our previous reports,48,49,87 explaining the effect of synthesis
conditions on the nanomaterials’ properties. The bimetallic
Ag–Co catalysts were synthesized in three modes as described
below using the following metallic ratio:

1.5 g Ag and 1.5 g
Co = 1:1 weight ratio and molar ratio of (Ag/Co = 1:1.83).

Mode 1—Silver–Cobalt
(Ag/Co3O4-11)
Bimetallic Ag–Co
was prepared from an aqueous solution of Ag nitrate (AgNO3), Co nitrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), and glycine (C2H5NO2) with a
fuel ratio (φ) of 1.75.48 The quantity
of metal nitrates and glycine was adjusted to obtain 1.5 g of the
solid product (with Ag/Co atomic ratio of 1:1.83) by using the stoichiometric
equation reported elsewhere.40,41,48,88 In the first mode of synthesis,
the metal nitrates of Ag and Co along with glycine in desired quantities
were dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water (DIW) and kept aside for
1 h to achieve a homogeneous solution. The beaker containing reactive
solution was placed on a hotplate heater at 250 °C. After sometime,
the water evaporates and the reactive mixture temperature increases
to reach the self-ignition temperature, where combustion starts and
converts the precursor mixture into Ag–Co bimetallic nanopowder
in a single step.

Mode 2—Silver First Cobalt Second
(Ag/Co3O4-12)
In the second mode of
synthesis, a two-step SWCS89 process was
utilized. Ag nanopowder was synthesized in the first step by following
the procedure of mode 1 using silver nitrate and glycine with a fuel
ratio of φ = 1.75. In the second step, the synthesized Ag nanopowder
was placed in the solution containing cobalt nitrate and glycine.
This mixture, when combusted, is expected to give Co NPs on the surface
of Ag NPs. This mode of combustion, termed as SWCS, is illustrated
in Scheme 1. SWCS consists
of two combustion steps to maximize the surface dispersion of Co on
Ag NPs.

Scheme 1 Stepwise Synthesis of Ag/Co3O4-12 Sample
(Mode 2) Using the Solution Combustion Technique
Mode 3—Cobalt First Silver Second
(Ag/Co3O4-21)
The third mode of synthesis
is similar to mode 2 except that Co was synthesized first and Ag later.
In this case, Ag content on the surface is expected to be more as
compared to other two modes. In all the three cases, the synthesized
nanopowder was collected, ground using mortar–pestle, and sieved
to get a uniform size of <75 μm agglomerated particles that
were used for electrocatalytic testing. These materials were dispersed
on carbon black to increase the electrical conductivity to be used
on the cathode side of the electrochemical system. A 30 mg of Ag–Co
was mixed with 3.5 mL of DIW and sonicated for 1 h; thereafter, 70
mg of carbon black was slowly added in the mixture that was further
sonicated for 3 h at 60 °C. The well-mixed sample was dried at
110 °C until all the water evaporates and the sample becomes
dry. The dried sample was further ground to get uniform size.

Material
Characterization
The crystalline structure of Ag/Co3O4 was identified using a Rigaku MiniFlexII Desktop X-ray
powder diffractometer with a wavelength of Cu Kα radiation and
10–80° scan range. Optical properties of the synthesized
catalysts were studied using Thermo Scientific Evolution 300 UV–visible
spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy (Thermo Nicolet FTIR 6700) spectra
of the as-synthesized samples were recorded in the range of 400–1800
cm–1 to understand the chemical bonding on the surface
of the catalyst. Morphology of the particles synthesized was analyzed
with SEM (Nova Nano 450, FEI). A high-resolution transmission electron
microscope (Tecnai G2, F20, FEI) has been used to identify
the presence of NPs and its size distribution. XPS (Kratos AXIS Ultra
DLD) was used to analyze the elemental composition and the bonding
configuration on the surface of bimetallic NPs.

Electrochemical
Measurement
Electrochemical activities were measured in a
standard three-cell PINE instrument bipotentiostat (WaveDriver 20)
with 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at the room temperature. A 5 mm diameter
glassy electrode was used as the working electrode and Hg/Hg2SO4 single junction electrode and platinum wire were used
as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. All the
potentials are reported relative to the NHE by adding a +0.64 V to
the potential versus Hg/Hg2SO4. The working
electrode was prepared by dispersing 10 mg of the Ag–Co/C sample
in 2.5 mL of water and sonicating it for 1 h. A 20 μL of the
dispersed solution was added dropwise on the glassy carbon attached
to the Teflon RDE housing (Pine Instruments) that can be connected
to the rotator. Once dried, a 20 μL of Nafion (0.125 wt %) solution
was dropped on the surface to bind the catalyst over the electrode.

The working electrode was pretreated electrochemically with a scan
rate of 500 mV s–1 for 100 cycles in the potential
range of −0.8 to 0.2 V before conducting CV experiments. The
electrolyte solution was purged by bubbling high-purity N2 gas for 1 h before conducting CV experiments. CV data were recorded
from −0.8 to 0.8 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. Oxygen reduction and evolution studies were conducted after purging
the electrolyte solution with O2 for 1 h. LSV data were
collected at 5 mV s–1 scan rate with a rotation
speed ranging from 400 to 1600 rpm. KL plot was analyzed for each
sample, and the number of electron transferred (n) was calculated from the slope of the best linear fit based on the
KL equation.90,91 6   7   8  where J, JL, and JK are measured current densities,
diffusion-limited current densities owing to transport, and kinetic
current densities related to charge transfer, respectively. Also,
ω is the electrode angular rotation velocities, n is the overall electron transfer, F is the Faraday
constant (96 485 C mol–1), C0 is the bulk concentration of O2 dissolved
in the electrolyte (7.8 × 10–7 mol cm–3 for 1 M KOH), v is the kinematic velocity of the
electrolyte (0.01 cm2 s–1), D0 is the O2 diffusion coefficient (1.9 ×
10–5 cm2 s–1), and k is the electron-transfer rate constant.92
