A mild transition-metal-free
protocol to prepare 2,3-dialkylated
tartaric acid esters has been developed by taking advantage of a visible
light photoredox-catalyzed reductive dimerization of α-ketoesters
with a combination of an organic dye photocatalyst and a Hantzsch-type
1,4-dihydropyridine hydrogen donor. A broad range of functional groups
including cyclopropane, alkene, alkyne, 4-methoxybenzyl ether, acetal,
silyl ether, carbamate, cyclic ether, cyclic thioether, bromoalkane,
and N-alkoxyphthalimide are well-compatible. By employing
the visible light photoredox-catalyzed reductive coupling and the
subsequent optical resolution, both enantioenriched diastereomers
of 2,3-dialkylated tartaric acid could be acquired conveniently.

Introduction
Since the first isolation
by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1769, tartaric
acid and its derivatives have been applied widely in organic synthesis
as resolving agents,1 chiral auxiliaries,2 and natural chiral pools.3 Most importantly, an array of tartaric acid-derived compounds performed
perfectly as privileged chiral ligands and catalysts in modern asymmetric
synthesis, providing versatile opportunities to access optically active
compounds in a catalytic fashion.4−6 These chiral ligands
and catalysts were mainly generated by specific modifications on either
the existing carboxylic acid or alcohol functionalities of the naturally
occurring (2R,3R)-dimethyl tartaric
acid, while the modification of the C2 and C3 positions of the backbone
was kept to be inconvenient (Figure 1). In some cases, a few alkyl substituents could be
introduced to the C2 and C3 positions of the tartaric acid through
alkylation of the corresponding enolates, in which multiple group
protections and usage of strong bases are always required and competitive
side reactions might be caused.3a,3e,3f Therefore, the development of more convenient and general approaches
to 2,3-disubstituted tartaric acids together with their derivatives
still remains in high demand. Such methodologies will not only expand
the ligand framework diversity but also be helpful to acquire new
insightful understandings on stereoselective transformations.

Figure 1 Tartaric acid
and its derivatives.

Reductive dimerization of α-ketoesters makes 2,3-disubstituted
tartaric acids available in a more straightforward manner, even though
the bulky steric hindrance should be surmounted during the formation
of two consecutive quaternary carbon centers. Actually, this kind
of carbon–carbon bond formation based on the coupling of ketyl
radicals has been carried out in a set of conditions in the past decades
(Scheme 1), which involves
the employment of stoichiometric amounts of one-electron-donating
metal reagents [SmI2, TiCl3, and Mg(0)] and
the utilization of high energetic UV light with coreductants.7,8 A recent Rueping’s work on visible light photoredox-catalyzed
reductive coupling of ketones showed that two α-ketoester substrates
were transformed to the corresponding 2,3-dialkylated tartaric acid
esters in moderate yields under the catalysis of a polypyridyl–iridium
complex.9 Almost at that time, we launched
a project on scalable synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted tartaric acids,
in which a protocol based on organic dye catalysis10 was envisioned with the consideration of obviation of transition
metals and potential industrial applications. In this paper, we would
like to report the developed transition-metal-free protocol, which
features substantially mild condition and general functional group
tolerance.

Scheme 1 Reductive Coupling of α-Ketoester under Different
Conditions
Results and Discussion
This study was initiated by choosing α-ketoester 1a as a model substrate, which contains a bulky isopropyl attached
to the carbonyl group. An array of photocatalysts including rhodamine
B (RhB), fluorescein (FL), rose bengal (RB), and Na2-Eosin
Y (EY) were examined first by establishing a Hantzsch-type 1,4-dihydropyridine
as a hydrogen donor and a 23 W compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) as a
light source (Table 1, entries 1–4). It was demonstrated that Na2-EY
exhibits the best catalytic efficiency in terms of yield and reaction
time. Hence, in a degassed dimethylformamide (DMF) solution containing
10 mol % of Na2-EY and 0.6 equiv of diethyl 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate
(HEH), 1a was smoothly converted to dimethyl 2,3-diisopropyltartrate 2a in 64% yield at room temperature after 4 h of irradiation.
However, when the light source was changed to 10 W white light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), the reaction was further accelerated even though the
yield was kept the same (Table 1, entry 5). Under identical irradiation, solvent screening
suggested that a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and water (95:5
v/v) is more favorable than either DMF or THF, giving 2a in an increased isolated yield (Table 1, entries 6–7). The yield of product
was improved to 87% when the amount of Na2-EY was decreased
from 5% to 2 mol % (Table 1, entries 8–9), while further reduction of the photocatalyst
resulted in a prolonged reaction time (Table 1, entry 10). Other two types of hydrogen
donors, 2-phenyl-dihydrobenzothiazoline (BT) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), were also attempted
to replace HEH; inferior results were afforded (Table 1, entries 11–12). Further fine-tuning
of the condition parameters indicated that 0.55 equiv of HEH are preferred
to assure the complete conversion of 1a in a 0.05 M solution
concentration (Table 1, entries 13–16). The control experiments also showed that
no reaction occurred in the absence of either a photocatalyst or a
light source (Table 1, entries 17–18). Accordingly, the optimal conditions for
this metal-free reductive coupling were established as follows: 2
mol % of Na2-EY as the catalyst, 0.55 equiv of HEH as the
hydrogen donor, THF/H2O (95:5 v/v) as the solvent, and
10 W white LEDs as the light source.

With the optimal
reaction conditions in hand, the scope of the
substrates was then explored (Table 2). Apart from 1a, α-ketoesters 1b–1e containing an acyclic primary alkyl substituent
(Me, n-C6H13) or a cyclic secondary
alkyl substituent (cyclopropyl, cyclohexyl) connected with a carbonyl
group underwent the photoredox-catalyzed reductive coupling reaction
smoothly, affording the corresponding dimethyl 2,3-dialkylated tartrates 2b–2e in a yield ranging from 80 to 92%. To differentiate
the 1H NMR spectra of dl and meso forms of the
products, we further confirmed the crystal structure of meso-2e diastereomer by using an X-ray diffraction technique
(CCDC 1547831) (Figure 2). It is worthy to mention that the cyclopropyl moiety was kept intact
in this type of radical process. However, for α-ketoester 1f, carbonyl reduction occurred instead of the expected coupling,
suggesting that the bulky adamantyl substituent adjacent to the carbonyl
group should inhibit the carbon–carbon bond formation of two
ketyl radicals. For α-ketoesters 1g–1i with
an appendant terminal alkene or a silylated internal alkyne group,
all photoredox-catalyzed reductive coupling reactions were performed
well to give 2g–2i in satisfactory yields (from
70 to 80%). The internal carbon–carbon π bonds remained
untouched, and no cross-coupling between the carbon–carbon
π bond and the carbonyl group was detected. A variety of α-ketoesters 1j–1q with different heteroatom-containing groups involving
4-methoxybenzyl ether, aldehyde acetal, silyl ether, secondary amine
carbamate, cyclic ether, cyclic thioether, bromoalkane, and N-alkoxyphthalimide were converted to 2j–2q as expected in moderate to good yields, highlighting the general
group tolerance of the conditions. Of note is the inertness of C–Br
bond and N–O bond, both of which are prone to cleavage in the
reductive conditions.11,12 For 1r bearing two
electron-withdrawing groups (CO2Me) attached to the same
carbonyl group, no reductive coupling was captured and only carbonyl
reduction was observed as the major reaction. To further detect the
effect of ester group, α-ketoesters 1s–1v with various alkoxy groups (PhO, BnO, cyclohexyloxy, and tert-butoxy) were then examined under the standard condition.
However, 2s–2v were generated in a comparative
yield with a similar dl/meso ratio, indicating that the effect
of ester moiety is not distinguished. In addition, the reaction of
the substrate 1w bearing a chiral moiety (R-1-phenylethyl ester) also afforded a mixture of two diastereomers 2w (dr = 1:1.1 by 1H NMR). This mentions that the
stereogenic center of the substrate 1w did not have much
impact on the behaviors of the ketyl radical coupling as well as the
stereochemical selectivity.

c Alcohol product was isolated.

A mechanism involving proton-coupled electron transfer
was proposed
to account for the visible light photoredox-catalyzed reductive coupling
(Scheme 2).13 Initially, the excited-state EY* [*E1/2red = 0.83
V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE)]14 is generated from Na2-EY by irradiation of visible light.
A single electron transfer from Hantzsch-type 1,4-dihydropyridine
(HEH) to the excited-state EY* would afford radical anion EY•– (E1/2ox = −1.08 V vs SCE)15 and
a radical cation HEH•+.16 After an electron transfer from radical anion EY•– and a proton transfer from either radical cation HEH•+ or cation HEH+, a neutral ketyl radical is formed from
α-ketoester, which immediately undergoes dimerization to give
2,3-disubstituted tartaric acid ester. Owing to the high reduction
potential of α-ketoester, as evidenced by 1a (E1/2red = −1.75 V vs SCE) (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information for details), a transient hydrogen-bonded
complex was supposed, which might facilitate the concurrent electron
transfer from radical anion EY•– to the carbonyl
group. To confirm the radical pathway, two radical-trapping experiments
were performed using 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO)
and 1,1-diphenylethylene as radical scavengers, respectively (Scheme 3). When 1 equiv of
TEMPO was introduced to the standard reaction system, the visible
light photoredox-catalyzed dimerization of 1b was completely
inhibited and no dimerized product was detected. Instead, a high yield
of TEMPOH was provided. In
the other parallel experiment using 5 equiv of 1,1-diphenylethylene,
a competitive ketyl–olefin–ketyl coupling product 3 was isolated in 35% yield, along with the dimeric product 2b (53% yield). These results mention that the ketyl radical
species does play as the reactive intermediate in this type of visible
light photoredox-catalyzed dimerization.

Intermediates
To test the practicality
of the transition-metal-free protocol,
the visible light photoredox-catalyzed reductive coupling reactions
were carried out on a 60 mmol scale. By prolonging the reaction times, 1b, 1e, and 1t were transformed
to the desired products 2b, 2e, and 2t without erosion of the yield, demonstrating that the new
protocol is valuable for scale synthesis (Table 3).

To get enantioenriched
2,3-dialkylated tartaric acids, two complementary
optical resolution experiments were performed by using brucine and
quinine as chiral-resolving reagents (Scheme 4).17 As reported,
the racemic 2,3-dimethyl tartaric acid 4 can be separated
from its meso diastereomer in barium salt forms. By taking advantage
of the different solubility of the diastereomers in water or ethanol,
(2S,3S)-4·brucine
and (2R,3R)-4·quinine
can be purified by repetitive recrystallizations. After acidic dissociation
of the salts, (2S,3S)-dimethyl tartaric
acid or (2R,3R)-dimethyl tartaric
acid could be obtained with the optical purity almost identical to
the literature values [[α]D20 = −13.2 (c = 4.0,
H2O) and [α]D20 = +13.2 (c = 4.0, H2O)].17a

Conclusions
A transition-metal-free protocol to prepare
2,3-dialkylated tartaric
acid esters from α-ketoesters has been developed by means of
a visible light photoredox-catalyzed reductive coupling, in which
an organic dye Na2-EY was used as the photocatalyst and
a Hantzsch-type 1,4-dihydropyridine was used as the hydrogen donor.
A range of functional groups such as cyclopropane, alkene, alkyne,
4-methoxybenzyl ether, aldehyde acetal, silyl ether, secondary amine
carbamate, cyclic ether, cyclic thioether, bromoalkane, and N-alkoxyphthalimide can be well-tolerated under the optimal
conditions. Optically pure 2,3-dialkylated tartaric acid diastereomers
can be obtained by combining the photoredox-catalyzed reductive coupling
and optical resolution.

Experimental Section
General Information
All melting points were determined
without correction. The 1H NMR spectra were obtained at
400 MHz, and the 13C NMR spectra were obtained at 100 MHz.
The spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 solution using the residual protonated solvent
as the internal standard; J values were given in
hertz. Mass spectra (ESI) were recorded on an LCQ Fleet spectrometer.
High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) analyses were determined
on a Q-TOF-MS spectrometer. α-Ketoester 1b was
purchased directly.

General Procedure for the Preparation of
α-Ketoesters 1a, 1c–1e, and 1g–1k(18)
To a stirred suspension of magnesium turnings (30 mmol, 1.5 equiv)
in anhydrous THF (5 mL) was added a crystal of I2 as an
activator. After stirring for 5 min, a solution of bromide (20 mmol,
1.0 equiv) in anhydrous THF (20 mL) was added dropwise (a water bath
was used to control the temperature below 35 °C). The suspension
was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, and the resulting Grignard
reagent was used directly for the next step.

To a solution of
dimethyl oxalate (20 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in anhydrous THF (30 mL) at
−78 °C was added dropwise the Grignard reagents (commercially
available or prepared as shown above) for more than 1 h. After stirring
for 1 h at −78 °C, the mixture was warmed to room temperature,
quenched with a saturated solution of NH4Cl (30 mL), and
extracted with Et2O (3 × 20 mL). The combined organic
layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated
in a rotary evaporator under vacuum. The residue was purified by silica
gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 30:1 v/v
for 1c, 1e, 1g–1i; 15:1
v/v for 1j and 1k) or distillation under
vacuum (1a, 1d) to afford pure α-ketoester.
