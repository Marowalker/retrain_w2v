Electrowetting has drawn significant
interest because of the potential
applications of displays, lab-on-a-chip microfluidic devices, electro-optical
switches, and so forth. However, electrowetting display (EWD) is monostable,
which needs extra continuous voltage supply to keep contracting the
oil. This paper is concerned with the simulation of two-phase liquid
flow in three-dimensional EWD pixels with two electrodes (E1 and E2)
demonstrating bistability, where power is only needed to move the
oil droplet between two stable states. The effects of E1 geometry,
E2 geometry, and E2 pulse characteristics on the dynamics of the oil
droplet motion have been analyzed. Also, predictions of the transient
states in four stages of the reversible bistable operation process
have been carried out by employing the finite element method, in qualitative
agreement with our experimental results of the monostable EWD and
the existing literature. We seek to shed more light on the fundamental
two-phase liquid flow in three-dimensional pixels exhibiting bistability
for low power EWD and guide optimizing the electrodes to the perfect
patterns with the aid of rigorous modeling.

1 Introduction
Electrowetting
has shown the potential of microscale fluid motion
manipulation by changing the surface tension, which has been widely
used in chemistry,1,2 bioengineering,3 sensors,4 and displays.5,6 Electrowetting displays (EWDs) reflect ambient light to provide
a paper-like display with competitive advantages such as capable of
video playback, low power consumption, sunlight readability, and reading
comfort. Hayes and Feenstra first proposed an EWD to show the ability
of video-speed response time (<10 ms), which was published in 2003;5 then, <2 ms switching speed has been reached
by Smith in 2008.7 Heikenfeld used Young–Laplace
transposition of brilliant pigment dispersions to realize electro-fluidic
display, showing its low power consumption in 2009.8 EWDs also show >50% white state reflectance,9 flexibility,10 multigray
scale,11 and full color.12

Despite the great success of conventional EWD, it
is monostable,
which needs extra continuous voltage supply to keep contracting the
oil. The oil will return to the initial relaxation off-state if the
voltage is removed. In bistable electrowetting display (BEWD) pixels,
droplets are confined in either of two distinct stable states that
are electrically switchable, power is only needed to switch the pixel
but not required to maintain the pixel state once switching is finished.
BEWD is the desire for very low power dynamic display (1 mW/in.2) or zero power static display better than typical EWD (20
mW/in.2), LCD (80 mW/in.2), and OLED (170 mW/in.2). However, the two stable states of liquids are usually realized
by specially designed and more complicated pixel structures, which
causes difficulties in the fabrication process. Because of these challenges,
research studies on BEWD lag far behind that of conventional EWD.
Therefore, more effort is needed to push the BEWD technology forward.
Advanced Display Technologies company utilized droplet driven display
(3D) technology for a successful BEWD prototype demonstration,13 but the aperture ratio was not well accepted. The University of Cincinnati
proposed a double layer of pixels able to achieve zero-power grayscale
operation with identical dimensions leading to a complex fabrication
process of the structure.14 Charipar proposed
EWDs utilizing bistable, multicolor pixels via laser processing with
planar electrodes, but the driving voltage was too high (>100 V).15

The dynamic behavior of microfluidics
is complex in confined EWD
pixels.16 Numerous parameters may affect
the optical performance result in defects, such as oil not closing,
oil overflow, and slow opening, which require a lot of time-consuming
and high-cost experimental verification work. To further predict the
feasibility of the scheme and optimize the design, it is necessary
to fully understand the motion of microfluidics in a pixel during
operation. For this reason, numerical simulations are used as a tool
for investigations. Ku et al. are among the first who attempted the
simulation of the microfluidic movement of different electrode patterns
for use in EWDs.17 Hsieh et al. proposed
a more rigorous and accurate model by coupling the electrohydrodynamic
(EHD) force deduced from the Maxwell stress tensor with the laminar
phase field of the oil/water dual phase.18 In general, the research models of microfluid flow including the
boundary element method,19 the spine-flux
method,20 the volume of fluid method,21,22 the level set method,23 and phase-field
method (PFM)18,24 are widely used. PFM is the most
promising and reliable among the abovementioned models as it facilitates
a thermodynamic treatment of the phase interfaces, rendering it more
physically consistent with the direct simulation of two-phase flow
by coupling the classical macroscopic laws of Cahn–Hilliard
(CH) equation and Navier–Stokes (NS) equations, where the necessary
terms are exchanged between the two sets of equations. However, there
are no PFM modeling published works devoted to the investigation of
two-phase microfluidic in three-dimensional BEWD pixels to the best
of our knowledge.

This work aims to investigate, through numerical
solutions and
computational modeling analysis, the tracking of the oil/water interfacial
dynamics in BEWD pixels. The model is obtained by employing the COMSOL
Multiphysics software package via coupling the CH equation, the NS
equation, and fundamental laws of electrostatics (FLE) calculations,
which contributes to the topic, on the theoretical side. The effects
of electrodes geometry including nonplanar L-shaped and U-shaped E1,
planar E1, and notched E2 will also be analyzed in the model. The
transient states of oil/water behavior actuated by optimized square
pulses of nonplanar E1 and E2 in three-dimensional BEWD pixels will
be presented. We thus demonstrate the feasibility of bistability in
three-dimensional pixels and greatly optimize the electrodes to the
perfect patterns, providing guidance to the electro-optic performance
improvement of BEWD ultimately.

2 Model Formulation
A novel three-dimensional BEWD pixel structure model with two nonplanar
electrodes is proposed based on the monostable EWD pixel with one
planar electrode,25 as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a show the micrographs of pixels
array and the unit pixel structure of the monostable EWD fabricated
by our team, where the motion of an oil droplet in the water phase
on a planar hydrophobic surface is controlled by the voltage on one
planar electrode.26 The model is based
on the cross-sectional view of the three-dimensional BEWD pixel structure
with quarter-circle electrode 1(E1) at the bottom of the pixel reservoir
and notched electrode 2(E2) on the top surface of the pixel step unable
to be confined in a single plane. The nonplanar E1 and E2 control
the oil droplet in the water phase to move between the pixel reservoir
and the pixel step, showing the potential of bistability, as shown
in Figure 1b.

model is based on the cross-sectional view (white dashed arrows) of
the oil droplet in the water phase motion controlled by two nonplanar
E1 and E2 in a three-dimensional BEWD pixel.

2.1 Governing Equations
2.1.1 Phase-Field Method
We adopt the
PFM to track the dynamic moving interface, which has been demonstrated
by numerous numerical studies to predict the effectiveness of droplet
movement on a solid surface.27−29 The moving interface between
oil and water is set as a tiny nonzero-thickness transition region.30 Thus, the physical properties at the interface
of the immiscible fluids could be described by functions within this
region with the help of a continuous phase-field variable ϕ,
which varies from −1 for water to 1 for oil.31 The volume fractions of the individual fluids of water
and oil are 1  

The multiphysics coupling feature defines
ρ as the density (kg/m3) of fluids, μ as the
viscosity (Pa·s) of fluids, and ε as the dielectric constant
of fluids to vary smoothly over the interface by letting31 2   3   4  

In the PFM interface, the two-phase flow dynamics
is governed by
a CH equation, which tracks a diffuse interface separating the immiscible
phases. The diffuse interface is defined as the region where the dimensionless
phase field variable goes from −1 to 1. When solved in COMSOL
Multiphysics, the CH equation is split up into two equations31 5   6  

In eq 5, u is the fluid velocity (m/s). The mobility M (m3·s/kg) can be expressed as M = χhPF2,
where χ is the characteristic
mobility, which controls the mobility of the interface. G is the chemical potential, a partial differential of the total free
energy concerning ϕ, as shown in eq 6, where λ is the mixing energy density
parameter (N). Also, λ and hPF are related to the oil/water interfacial tension γow through the relation31 7  hPF is a capillary
width that scales with the thickness of the diffuse interface in PFM.
The value of hPF should be determined
empirically,30 and we adopt hPF = hoil in the present simulation,
where hoil is the oil film thickness.

2.1.2 Mass and Momentum Transport
The
NS equations describe the transport of mass and momentum for fluids
of constant density in the PFM interface. To account for the dynamic
movement of the immiscible two-phase flow, it is crucial to include
surface tension in the model. The NS equations are then31 8   9  Here, u and ρ are the
velocity and density of the fluids. p, g, Fs, FE respectively
denote the pressure, the gravitational acceleration, the surface tension
force, and the volumetric electrodynamic force generated by an electric
field. In the PFM, FS can be calculated
over the computational domain in terms of the chemical potential and
phase-field variable by31 10  where G is the chemical potential
defined in eq 6 of CH
equations, that is, the CH and the NS equations are coupled via the
surface tension force FS. Obviously, FS approaches zero except those at the diffusive
thickness of the oil/water interface. The volumetric electrodynamic
force FE can be expressed by the divergence
of the Maxwell stress tensor TM(32) 11  

The Maxwell stress tensor is given
by32 12  where TiiM = εEi2 – ε/2(Ei2 + Ej2), TijM = εEiEj. The subscript i and j indicate
the directions x and y, respectively. E is the
electrical field strength.

2.1.3 Fundamental Laws of Electrostatics
The electrostatic force in the NS equation (FE) couples the flow equations with the equations of the electrostatics,
where the general form for this body force is ρVE. The water phase behaves as a conductive liquid by assigning
a high dielectric constant (80), which is compatible with the general
treatment in an EW theory.33 FLE resolved
in COMSOL Multiphysics commercial software are defined as32 13   14  

Equation 13 is a differential form of Gauss’s
Law, where D is the electric field displacement (ε0εrE), where ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum and εr is the relative permittivity. ρV is the volumetric
charge density. Equation 14 is a conservative field, where V is a potential
function.

2.2 Boundary Conditions
In this section,
we will assume the boundary conditions of the model in the present
study including the electrostatic field, PFM and mass, and momentum
transport boundary conditions. The modeling domain is the three-dimensional
unit pixel in BEWD, as shown in Figure 2. The electrostatic field in the hydrophobic layer,
the dielectric layer, hydrophilic pixel wall, oil phase, and water
phase, is assumed to be governed by FLE, the zero-charge condition
(ρV = 0) is adopted for all of the exterior boundaries
except the electrode regions. For the electrode regions, we specify
the voltage Vcom = 0 on the common electrode, VE1, and VE2 as the
voltages on the electrode E1 and E2, respectively. In the boundary
conditions of PFM, the solid surfaces (e.g., hydrophobic surface,
pixel wall, and top substrate) are considered as wetted surfaces,
and along the surfaces, we specify a wetted contact angle θw, which is related to ϕ through 15  where n is the unit vector
normal to the wall. With an applied voltage across the dielectric
layer, the initial contact angle of a conductive liquid on the hydrophobic
surface θFP decreases to θw according
to Young–Lippmann equation, 16  where C is the capacitance
per unit area of the hydrophobic and dielectric (F/m2), V is the dc voltage, and γAO is the interfacial
surface tension between the aqueous and oil phases (N/m).

Figure 2 Illustration
of the computational domain, quantities of physical
interest, main conservation equations, and boundary conditions employed
in the present study (not to scale).

In the boundary conditions of NS equation formulation, we assume
that there is no net flow in the water phase so that no pressure difference
was applied on the boundary of the water phase and the pressure at
the four outlets for a unit pixel is chosen as p =
0. Also, zero mass flux and no-slip boundary condition (u = 0) is used to associate with the mass and momentum equation. The
detailed parameters used in the present model comprising material
properties, interfacial properties, and geometric properties are listed

2.3 Mesh Independency Study
Three different
triangular mesh sizes, coarse mesh, medium mesh, and fine mesh, were
employed in this study, which corresponds to 11.4, 1.15, and 0.12
μm per unit, respectively. Figure 3 illustrates the predicted time evolution
of the contact radius of the oil droplet on the pixel step as compared
to the experimental measurements of our monostable EWD when dc of
30 V was applied. The results show that the 1.15 μm mesh yields
a satisfactory prediction of the measurements and further mesh refinement
does not drastically improve the prediction accuracy. Hence, a mesh
size of 1.15 μm per unit was used in the simulations of this
work.

droplet contact radius on the pixel step vs the experimental data

3 Results and Discussion
We next proceed
to evaluate the effect of various parameters like
E1 geometry, E2 geometry, and E2 pulse characteristics on the dynamics
of the oil droplet motion. Finally, we will demonstrate the application
of the reversible operation process of BEWD in a confined three-dimensional
pixel with two electrodes exhibiting bistability.

3.1 Effect
of E1 Geometry
The oil droplet
motion in the pixel reservoir is actuated by the localized change
in contact angle as a result of the electric field at the triple contact
line. Hence, it will be interesting to investigate the effect of E1
geometry on the electric field distributions (EFDs) in the pixel reservoir
to find the lowest actuation threshold voltage of the oil droplet.
E1 with electrodes on the left sidewall and bottom of the pixel reservoir,
E1 with electrodes on both sidewalls and the bottom of the pixel reservoir,
and E1 with electrode only at the bottom of the pixel reservoir are
defined as L-shaped, U-shaped, and planar E1, respectively. The EFD
data along the oil/water interface of the initial state from left
0 to right 50 μm position illustrated in the inset are plotted
in Figure 4. The EFD
of 60, 80, and 100 V threshold voltages on L-shaped, U-shaped, and
planar are three different E1 shapes, respectively, capable of moving
the oil out of the pixel reservoir in the model. The data were obtained
from the simulation results of COMSOL Multiphysics software package.
The voltage of the L-shaped E1 decreases gradually in the widest range
(44–4 V) among the three types of E1 from left to right along
the whole 50 μm interface, where the pressure gradient introduced
by a nonuniform contact angle is the driving force behind electrowetting-based
microfluidics. Hence, L-shaped E1 is favorable for fluids’
motion and the actuation threshold voltage is 60 V. However, the decreasing
range of voltage along the whole interface is small (47–38
V) in U-shaped E1, negative for oil/water motion, so the actuation
threshold voltage is 80 V. Most of the voltages along the interface
stay at around 60 V with a sharp decrease to 28 V at the end of the
interface (48–50 μm) in the planar E1, so it requires
the highest actuation threshold voltage (100 V) to move the oil out
of the pixel reservoir.

Figure 4 Distributions of the electrostatic field along
with the oil/water
interface of the initial state from the left 0 to the right 50 μm
position indicated in the inset, where the color bars represent 60,
80, and 100 V actuation threshold voltages on L-shaped, U-shaped,
and planar E1, respectively.

The switching speed between ON and OFF states is crucial for video
playback with no flicker of displays. We assumed that the same 85
V was applied on three types of E1 in the model; then, we plotted
the center of the main oil droplet position in the x-axis direction as a function of time consumed to move the oil from
the pixel reservoir to the pixel step, as shown in Figure 5. The modeling results show
that the L-shaped E1 design can be altered to optimize the speed at
which the oil droplet moves and also improve the reversibility of
the fluids.

Figure 5 Center of the main oil droplet position in the x-axis direction actuated by the same 85 V voltage on L-shaped, U-shaped,
and planar E1, obtained from the model and plotted as a function of
time; the insets indicate the final position of the oil droplet.

When dc 85 V was applied, no residual oil stayed
on the L-shaped
E1, residual oil stayed at the right corner of the pixel reservoir
of U-shaped E1, and residual oil stayed at both the left and right
corners of the pixel reservoir of planar E1, as shown in the insets
of Figure 5. In addition,
the residual oil is also voltage-dependent as demonstrated in the
model. The reason is that when the driving force reaches the threshold
to overcome the interfacial tension and moves the oil, the oil droplet
may easily split into different parts, resulting in the residual oil
left in the pixel reservoir. However, if the voltage is increased,
the driving force will be much larger than the interfacial tension
and the oil droplet will move out of the reservoir completely.

3.2 Effect of E2 Geometry
To quantitatively
characterize the motion of the oil droplet on the pixel step actuated
by different E2 geometry, the right edge position of the main oil
droplet as a function of time is plotted in Figure 5. When dc of 30 V was applied, voltage-dependent
oil deformation actuated by the nonplanar E2 design on the top surface
of the pixel step was more obvious than the planar E2 design at the
bottom of the pixel step, easily explained by the difference of a
thick dielectric pixel step (εPS = 3.28, hstep = 12 μm) on planar E2 reducing the
electrostatic field that the water experiences at the interface. As
a result, only notched E2 on the top surface of the pixel step succeeded
in moving the oil droplet close to the pixel reservoir, in agreement
with the experimental results of monostable EWD pixels of our team
shown in the insets.

3.3 Effect of E2 Pulse Characteristics
The pulse on nonplanar E2 (notched) was divided into two parts,
including
part one which aimed to merge the oil film to a droplet close to the
pixel reservoir, and part two of dc 60 V threshold voltage which moved
the oil droplet back to the pixel reservoir. We herein investigate
the pulse voltage and duration of part one. The position of the main
oil droplet right edge in the x-axis direction was
plotted as a function of part one voltage, as shown in Figure 7. dc 30 V should be the best voltage producing the maximum oil contraction
close to the pixel reservoir. Also, we could observe from Figure 6 that the oil finished
contracting in 1 ms, so we optimize the 5 ms E2 pulse to 30 V (1 ms)
and 60 V (4 ms) according to the analysis.

Figure 6 Oil was actuated by dc
30 V applied on different E2 geometry; only
nonplanar E2 (notched) on the top surface of the pixel step succeeded
in moving the oil droplet close to the pixel reservoir, in agreement
with micrographs of our fabricated monostable EWD pixels in the insets.

Figure 7 Evolution of the oil motion in the water phase actuated
by part
one of the E2 pulse from 0 to 60 V applied on E2. Oil film contracted
to one droplet from 0 to 30 V, which began to bend and rupture if
greater than 30 V is applied on E2.

3.4 Reversible Operation Process of BEWD
The
reversible operation process of the oil droplet motion in a confined
three-dimensional BEWD pixel is divided into four stages (a to d)
in the model, actuated by combined square pulse voltages of nonplanar
L-shaped E1 and notched E2 in Figure 8 investigated in the previous section. The detailed
oil droplet motion in every stage of the present model in Figure 9 (Video S1) will be described in this section.

Figure 8 Illustration of square
pulse actuation voltages including Vcom, VE1, and VE2 in a, b, c, and d stages in this model. Vcom is set to 0 in the full process, VE1 is set to 60 V square pulse in stage b, VE2 is set to 30 V (1 ms) and 60 V (4 ms) stepwise
square pulses in stage d. The full computation time of the modeling
process is 20 ms.

Figure 9 Spatiotemporal evolution
of reversible oil droplet motion process
in a three-dimensional BEWD pixel with square pulse voltages on L-shaped
E1 and notched E2 from t = 0 to 20 ms, where ϕ
is the phase-field variable varying from −1 for water to 1
for oil; yellow arrows indicate the velocity vector distributions
of the fluidics. (a) Stability of the oil phase stored in the pixel
reservoir demonstrating ON state without voltage in stage a. (b) Oil
crosses the pixel step in stage b with a square pulse on E1. (c) Oil
droplet relaxes to a film covering almost the whole pixel step surface,
showing the stable OFF state without voltage in stage c. (d) Oil flows
back to the reservoir in Stage d with stepwise square pulses on E2.

3.4.1 Stable ON State (Stage a)
Figure 9a shows the colored
oil concentrated in the pixel reservoir from 0 to 5 ms, where the
larger area of pixel step reflects a white backplane in the ON state.
The optimized L-shaped E1 and notched E2 demonstrated with advantages
were applied in the model. The hydrophobic pixel reservoir surface
provides a physical barrier to confine the oil phase contributing
to the stability of the ON-state without voltage. The absence of velocity
vector distributions (yellow arrows) in Figure 9a also demonstrates that there is no fluid
flow during 5 ms in stage a.

3.4.2 Oil
Crosses the Pixel Step (Stage b)
The oil droplet in the water
phase overcomes an energy barrier of
the pixel step edge with a 60 V square pulse to move the oil onto
the pixel step in stage b of this model. The evolution results of
the modeling demonstrate the full motion process of the oil phase
changing the position in stage b, as shown in Figure 9b, where the yellow arrows represent the
velocity vector indicating the trend of the fluid flow. Most part
of the oil droplet is gathered on the top surface of the pixel step
after stage b, resulting in a significant increase of the oil coverage
area on the pixel step.

3.4.3 Stable OFF State (Stage
c)
Figure 9c shows the evolution
of the oil phase relaxed without voltage on top of the pixel step
surface from a droplet to a film. When the voltage is removed, the
oil film remains stable on the top surface of the pixel step because
of the interfacial tension of oil/water fluids. As a result, the colored
oil covers almost the whole surface of the pixel step without voltage,
so this state of the pixel is called a stable OFF state.

3.4.4 Oil Flows Back to the Reservoir (Stage d)
A similar
mechanism describes the reverse motion of the oil droplet
from the top surface of the pixel step to the pixel reservoir when
30 V (1 ms) and 60 V (4 ms) stepwise square pulses are applied to
E2, analyzed in the previous section. The design of stepwise dc voltages
is also in accordance with the experimental result of Zhang et al.34 in monostable EWD pixels to avoid oil film splitting.
After most of the oil moves back to the pixel reservoir of stage d
in the model at 20 ms, it changes into the stable ON state of stage
a again, as shown in Figure 9d.

The reversible operation process of BEWD with 100
V square pulses on planar E1 and E2 in three-dimensional pixels predicted
by our model could reproduce the existing experimental results of
the prior literature reported by Charipar et al. in ref (15), demonstrating bistability.
Also, the modeling results of exhibiting bistability in three-dimensional
BEWD pixels with nonplanar electrodes are supported by the experimental
results reported by Zhang and Liang.35 The
numerical solutions of the presented modeling qualitatively agree
with the existing literature, which indicates the accuracy and capacity
of our model in dealing with oil/water interface tracking in three-dimensional
BEWD pixels.

4 Conclusions
BEWD
has received much attention in the literature owing to its
marked low power consumption. However, most studies were experimental.
Here, rigorous modeling of oil/water interface tracking in three-dimensional
BEWD pixels was obtained by employing the PFM of COMSOL Multiphysics
software package, numerical solutions, and contributions to the topic,
on the theoretical side. More importantly, the effects of E1 geometry,
E2 geometry, and E2 pulse characteristics on the dynamics of the oil
droplet motion have been analyzed. The advantages of nonplanar L-shaped
E1 and notched E2 design with stepwise square pulses were also demonstrated.
Then, the application of the reversible operation process in a confined
three-dimensional BEWD pixel has been realized, which reproduced the
existing experimental results, exhibiting bistability in a numerical
way. These results shed some light on the structure optimization of
the electrodes to the perfect pattern for oil/water two-phase flow
in three-dimensional BEWD pixels.
