In this study, a combination of alkali
roasting and hydrothermal
treatment is used as a method of gangue (Si, Al, and P) removal from
iron ores as a means to upgrade low-grade iron ore (limonite) into
a high-grade iron ore with low gangue content, low porosity, and high
Fe and Fe2O3 content to enhance the sustainable
development of iron and steel industries. The effects of the combined
treatments (NaOH hydrothermal treatment and H2O/NaOH hydrothermal
treatment of the alkali roasted sample), the iron ore type, their
physical properties, and their calcination/roasting temperatures on
the removal extent of gangue are investigated. The extent of Si, Al,
and P removal by subjecting iron ores to a 5 M NaOH hydrothermal treatment
at 300 °C reached 10–91%, 39–70%, and 38–76%,
respectively. When the iron ores are roasted with NaOH at 350 °C,
α-FeOOH in limonite transfers to NaFeO2. On the other
hand, for alkali roasted iron ores that inherently contain Fe2O3, Fe2O3 and Na2CO3 are also observed after the roasting treatment. Higher
Al and P removal extents are observed for H2O leaching
at room temperature in the prepared roasted samples (Roasting/H2O_RT) as compared to NaOH hydrothermal treatment, whereas
that of Si is low for all samples, except the iron ore with the highest
Fe content. After the H2O leaching process, the Fe form
is found to be in the amorphous form for all samples, except for the
iron ore sample of the highest Fe content. The reason for this is
thought to be due to the large amount of unreacted Fe2O3 with NaOH during the roasting process. The specific surface
area significantly increases after the Roasting/H2O_RT
treatment in all samples due to the dehydration of goethite (α-FeOOH
→ Fe2O3 + H2O) during the
roasting treatment and gangue removal during H2O leaching.
When the roasted samples are supplied for hydrothermal treatment by
H2O at 300 °C (Roasting/H2O_SC), the removal
rate of Si and P increases as compared with the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment. The influence of temperatures of calcination and
the roasting treatment on the extent of gangue removal in 5 M NaOH
hydrothermal, Roasting/H2O_RT, and Roasting/H2O_SC treatments is small. When NaOH hydrothermal treatment is carried
out on the samples that have undergone the Roasting/H2O_RT
treatment, a gangue removal extent of above 70–97% was achieved,
except for the iron ore with the lowest P content, which had the largest
loss of ignition and the lowest Fe content. In addition, it is revealed
that low-grade iron ore with a high pore properties, α-FeOOH
content, and gangue content can be upgraded to a high-grade iron ore
with a low pore property (low specific surface area and pore volume),
high Fe2O3 content, and low gangue content using
the above method. Therefore, this method is promising as a method
for upgrading low-grade iron ore.

==== Body
Introduction
A recent concern is the limited reserves
and the rapid depletion
of high-grade iron ore, which is utilized in the ironmaking process,
due to an increase in steel demand in emerging countries. In addition,
high-grade ore becomes higher in gangue (Si, Al, and P) and lower
in Fe contents, year by year. For this reason, in the future, the
iron and steel-making industry must actively use low-grade iron ore,
such as limonite, which has a large amount of goethite (α-FeOOH)
or gangue components. However, limonite has a large amount of combined
water, and its low strength is not suitable for utilization in a blast
furnace; the increasing gangue in the iron ore is directly related
to the increase in production of iron and steel-making slag. Therefore,
the increasing gangue in iron ore also increases the reducing agent
ratio (coke usage) and decreases the tapping ratio (pig iron amount)
for the blast furnace method. In other words, this increases energy
consumption, CO2 emissions, and iron production costs and
decreases iron productivity for the ironmaking process, which is attributed
to the increasing gangue in iron ore. It is therefore essential to
develop a technology for an upgrading method for low-grade iron ore,
which can be achieved by lowering the gangue content and raising the
Fe content, for the sustainable development of the iron and steel
industry, and the method has been sought after.

It is well-known
that Si, Al, and P in iron ore exist as quartz,
alumina, kaolinite, aluminosilicate, chlorite, ferric silicate, fayalite,
apatite species (fluoroapatite, hydroxyapatite, apatite etc.),1−6 other P species,7 etc. The gangue removal,
especially concerning P, through chemical and physical methods has
been investigated by many researchers.1−24 It is revealed that chemical leaching is an effective method for
P removal from iron ore or calcined/alkali roasted iron ores.3,7−17 However, in the chemical leaching reports described above, there
are only a few studies focusing on removal of Si and Al.14,15 In addition, although chemical leaching methods using sulfuric acid,
hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid against iron ore or calcined/alkali
roasted iron ore are effective for the removal of high P content,3,10,11,13,15,17 there are
problems such as low Si and Al removal as well as the loss of Fe.
In the above reports of P removal,1−24 the investigations were carried out against only one type of iron
ore with high P contents, and statistical data acquisition for the
removal of gangue from iron ore with different chemical components,
physical properties, and different countries of production has not
been done. It is therefore important to develop a technology capable
of collectively removing gangue components, in particular the high
levels of Si and Al content and P affecting the brittleness of the
final product from iron ores; the development of technologies concerning
these products, which vary in type and are produced in different countries,
is vital for sustainable development in iron and steel-making industries
worldwide.

Our research
group has been investigating the removal of gangue
from several types of iron ore having different chemical compositions
and physical properties, which is produced in the different countries,
and found that hydrothermal treatment with NaOH is an effective solution
for gangue removal.25 The removal extent
of Si, Al, and P ranged at 10–92%, 38–70%, and 37–78%,
and it depends on the types of iron ore. In the present study, we
examine the removal of gangue (Si, Al, and P) from iron ores with
a combination of alkali roasting and hydrothermal treatment to attain
a higher removal extent of gangue than hydrothermal treatment with
NaOH only because it has been reported that a combination of NaOH
alkali roasting and water leaching at RT to100 °C is effective
in the removal of gangue.14The effects
of the combination of each treatment (leaching at room temperature
and hydrothermal treatments of a roasted sample), type of iron ore,
physical properties, and calcination temperature on the removal extent
of gangue were investigated to develop an upgrading method for producing
high-grade iron from low-grade iron ore (limonite).

Results and Discussion
Removal
of Gangue Component during Hydrothermal Treatment with
NaOH
Table 1 shows the chemical composition, pore properties, and iron forms
of the iron ore used in this study. Table 2 summarizes the yield, gangue removal extent,
pore properties, and Fe forms in the iron ores treated with a hydrothermal
method using 5 M NaOH at 300 °C.25 The yields ranged from 80 to 87%, and a decrease was observed due
to the dehydration of limonite and gangue removal. The removal extent
of Si, Al, and P ranged between 10–92%, 39–70%, and
38–78%, respectively, and showed a large trend for BRH, which
has the highest Fe content, Fe2O3 form, and
the lowest loss of ignition (LOI) in the iron ores used in the present
study. When the relationship among the gangue components was investigated,
positive and negative correlations were found in Al versus P, Al versus
Si, and P versus Si.25 The iron forms (α-FeOOH)
in the original iron ore changed to Fe2O3 after
the samples had been treated. Both the specific surface area and pore
volume values of the original iron ore (2–80 m2/g
and <0.01 to 0.20 cm3/g) decreased to <1 to 15 cm2/g and <0.01 to 0.10 cm3/g, respectively, for
all samples obtained after treatment. This decrease means that the
sintering of Fe species after dehydration of α-FeOOH in the
iron ores occurs through NaOH hydrothermal treatment, irrespective
of the iron ore type, because significantly decrease in specific surface
area, pore volume, and changing of Fe forms were not observed in the
hydrothermal treatment using distilled water.25 Here, decrease in specific surface area and pore volume for treated
samples measured by the N2 adsorption method shows occurrence
of Fe species sintering. Now, although the reason why NaOH causes
Fe sintering is not clear, it may be due to the morphological change
of Fe species caused by the reaction between Fe species and NaOH.
From the equilibrium calculation results, it was estimated that the
gangue removal occurs due to a reaction of Si, Al, or P and NaOH solution
during the hydrothermal treatment accompanied with a rearrangement
of the Fe structure.25 In conclusion, although
the NaOH hydrothermal treatment is effective in gangue removal from
high-grade iron ore, some are not effective for the low-grade ore.

Effect of Alkali
Roasting on Gangue Removal with Distilled Water
Leaching at Room Temperature
Figure 1 shows extent of gangue removal from NaOH-roasted
iron ores prepared at 350 °C, which is the temperature that the
dehydration reaction occurs for limonite, and treated with H2O at room temperature (Roasting/H2O_RT treatment). The
characterization results of Roasting/H2O_RT samples are
listed in Table 3 and Figure 2. The results of
the iron ore prepared by calcination up to 350 °C in air are
also listed in Table 3 for comparison. The extent of removal of Si, Al, and P were 4–72%,
43–75%, and 32–78%, respectively, and the order of the
samples were ILS = MLL < INL < ALY < WAL < ALR ≪
BRH for Si, ALR = INL < WAL < ALY < MLL < ILS < BRH
for Al, and INL ≪ ALR < BRH = ALY = WAL < MLL = ILS for
P. Here, the largest extent of gangue removal was found for BRH, which
is classified as a high-grade iron ore in the samples used in the
present study. The order of the extent of gangue removal components
increased as Si ≪ Al < P. It is therefore revealed that
the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment is effective for gangue removal,
especially for Al and P removal. Comparable results have been reported
by another research group.14 Although Roasting/H2O_RT treatments are effective for gangue removal, the extent
of Si and Al removal was lower than that of the 5 M NaOH hydrothermal
treatment (Table 2).
This difference may show that the gangue removal mechanism is different
between both treatments. In addition, this difference occurs due to
occurrence of gangue removal by the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment.
On the other hand, for a comparison between the specific surface area
of a calcined sample in air at 350 °C and Roasting/H2O_RT samples (Table 3), the latter samples provided higher values than the former samples,
and it tended to increase with the order of increasing LOI values.
However, pore volumes were similar for both samples. Although the
reason is not clear, the agglomeration of pores may occur during the
treatment. It was suggested that the decreasing yield and increasing
specific surface area occur due to gangue removal. Figure 2 presents the XRD patterns
of the samples before and after H2O treatment at room temperature
for comparison. The distributed peaks of Fe2O3 were observed for all calcined samples at 350 °C in air (Table 2). For roasted samples,
the peaks that are attributable to NaFeO2 were detected
for all samples (Figure 2, left), and existing Na2CO3 was also observed
only for BRH and WAL, whose Fe2O3 was observed
in the original samples before treatment (Table 1).25 In addition,
the SiO2 peaks and unknown peaks disappeared for roasted
samples. The NaFeO2 and Na2CO3 peaks
observed for roasted samples almost disappeared after H2O leaching treatment (Figure 2, right), and these XRD patterns consisted of a broad profile,
except for BRH, which provided the Fe2O3 peaks.
The reason for this was thought to be due to the large amount of unreacted
Fe2O3 with NaOH during the roasting process.
The melting point of NaOH is approximately 320 °C, and NaOH became
molten until 350 °C during the NaOH roasting sample preparation.
In addition, the dehydration of α-FeOOH in limonite and the
development of the pore structure occur until 350 °C.25,26 Therefore, it was suggested that the limonite dehydration reaction
had occurred, at the same time, as the molten NaOH penetrated the
pores produced by dehydration and reacted with the iron ore constituents.25 The formation of Na2CO3 may derive from an exposure of NaOH in the laboratory atmosphere,
which is nonreacted NaOH with an iron ore composition. According to
the equilibrium calculation results, eq 1 is favorable by a thermodynamic equilibrium calculation
at RT to 350 °C. 1   2

Gibbs standard free energies (ΔG) of eqs 1 and 2 are the same. Therefore, the existing pore may be affecting the
formation of NaFeO2 during the preparation of the roasting
samples because for BRH, which has an Fe2O3 form
and low pore properties, Fe2O3 and Na2CO3 were observed in roasted samples. For eqs 1 and 2, the
produced NaFeO2 is hydrolyzed by H2O addition
to the Fe2O3 and NaOH solution. However, the
clear diffraction peaks of Fe2O3 were not found
in Roasting/H2O_RT samples, except for BRH. This result
shows that the rearrangement of Fe species occurs due to the reaction
between NaOH and Fe species during the roasting process because NaFeO2 and amorphous Fe are observed in Figure 2. According to previous reports, Si, Al,
and P exist in iron ores as quartz (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), aluminosilicate (e.g., Al2O3·SiO2), fayalite (Fe2SiO4), kaolinite (Al2Si2O7·2H2O), apatite species (e.g., Ca5(PO4)3OH or Ca2(PO4)2CaF2)), iron phosphate (Fe3PO7), etc.1−9,27,28 Based on these reports, the equilibrium calculation was performed
to investigate the gangue removal mechanism through the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment. For the calculation, assuming the Si, Al,
or P species mentioned above reacts with NaOH according to the eqs 3–19. The Gibbs standard free energies of ΔG at 0–350 °C for eqs 3–19 are listed in Table 4. 3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19  Here, FePO4 was
used instead of Fe3PO7 because the latter specie
does not exist in the HSC Chemistry5.1 (Outokumpu Research Oy) database,
and eqs 12–15 were a referenced equation from ref.11 The reactions of eqs 3–12 and 19 (denoted as rearrangement reactions) are supported
by thermoequilibrium calculations, and the produced Na-Si, Na-Al,
and Na-P compounds have the property of being water-soluble at room
temperature. Therefore, a high removal extent of Al and P for the
Roasting/H2O_RT treatment may be observed by the rearrangement
of gangue components. On the other hand, the extent of Si removal
was low for all samples, except for BRH. This reason may be due to
a large portion of Si exists in an iron ore other than SiO2 or kaolinite. Furthermore, low extent of Si removal may be caused
by a production of water-insoluble Si species, such as CaSiO3. Although, eq 20 is
favorable by thermoequilibrium, the water solubility of the produced
CaSiO3 is exceptionally low being 0.01 g/100 mL H2O at 20 °C. Equation 21 is also supported by thermoequilibrium for calculation at
150–350 °C, but at a lower temperature (20–150
°C), the reaction of eq 20 occurs easier than eq 21. 20   21

The rearrangement reaction for the
formation of the insoluble Si
form and inherently Si form in iron ore may influence the low removal
extent of Si using the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment. According
to a previous report, it is well accepted that P in limonite exists
as an adsorption form into limonite, this replaced the form with a
part of Fe oxide, and apatite species.7−9,27 In addition, it is believed that the apatite-type P has been demonstrated
to be easily removed by chemical leaching,12,14,17,29 whereas simple
chemical leaching is ineffective for the goethite matrix-associated
P.10 Some hypothesis has been proposed
for P associated with the goethite matrix; P exists in solid solution
with goethite,30 and P in goethite exists
in the form of grattarolaite (Fe3PO7) via the
replacement of a surface hydroxyl group by a P ligand.10,28 Moreover, it is considered that P in goethite has been found to
be much less soluble than P in hematite, and a heat treatment (such
as roasting or alkali roasting) prior to leaching is necessary to
obtain a high extent of P removal.23 In
the present study, the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment provides
higher P removal than the NaOH hydrothermal treatment for many of
the iron ores used. For P removal in iron ore using a combination
of roasting, alkali roasting/chemical leaching, or magnetic separation,
it has been reported that an occurrence of structural rearrangement
(changing of hematite to goethite for a calcination/reaction in the
gangue component to form an acid-soluble form for the calcination/reaction
with the alkali and gangue mineral during roasting, which then forms
an acid soluble form for alkali roasting) produces acid-soluble Si,
Al, or Si-Al species containing P and damaging the ore structure,
and these treatments promote the removal of P10,24,31 by using acid leaching. As shown in Table 4, the Fe, Si, Al,
and P rearrangement reactions occur easily in NaOH roasting conditions.
The high gangue extents of removal from roasted samples were achieved
through H2O treatment because water-soluble Al and P are
produced by NaOH roasting. Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between Si, Al, and P
removal. Although there is some scattering, the negative and positive
correlations were observed for Si versus Al and Al versus P in all
samples, except for INL. This correlation suggests that P exists as
an associated-Al form, beside the apatite species, etc., and this
Al-associated P might be existing as Fe oxide replaced or associated
with limonite in iron ore. From these results, it was found that the
Roasting/H2O_RT treatment is an effective method for upgrading
several kinds of low-grade iron ore, from the viewpoint of gangue
removal, especially Al and P removal, irrespective of the producing
countries. However, as seen in Table 3, the specific surface area increases significantly
from the original values (2–80 m2/g) or calcined
sample values (3–130 m2/g) to 15–175 m2/g. Figure 4 shows the comparison between the specific surface area of the original
sample calcined at 350 °C in air and Roasting/H2O_RT
samples. The specific surface area in Roasting/H2O_RT samples
is larger than those of calcined samples. It is considered that the
increasing specific surface area occurs due to the removal of gangue
for Roasting/H2O_RT and the rearrangement of the Fe species.
Thus, it is necessary for the method of high Fe crystallization and
low pore properties of iron ores to completely develop an upgrading
method.

P with the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment.

Removal of Gangue by Combination of Alkali Roasting and H2O Hydrothermal Treatments
In this section, a hydrothermal
treatment with H2O against NaOH roasting samples was carried
out because relatively significant extent of gangue removal was observed
by using the NaOH hydrothermal treatment and Roasting/H2O_RT treatment as shown in Table 2 and Figure 1. H2O was used for the hydrothermal treatment of
the roasted sample, and the mixture was heated at 300 °C for
30 min (denoted as Roasting/H2O_SC). Here, as is mentioned
above, it was thought that NaFeO2 or nonreacted Na species
(Na2CO3 and NaOH) in roasted samples are hydrolyzed
to Fe2O3 and NaOH solutions by the addition
of H2O to the roasting samples. In other words, the hydrothermal
treatment of roasted samples was carried out in a Na-containing solution
containing a water-soluble gangue component at room temperature. The
results are shown in Figure 5. The extent of Si, Al, and P removal ranged between 16–95%,
39–80%, and 30–90%, respectively, and the extent of
P removal from all samples reached above 60%, except for INL. The
order in which the extent increased is INL < ILS < MLL = WAL
< ALR = ALY ≪ BRH for Si, INL = ALR < WAL < ALY <
MLL < ILS < BRH for Al, and INL ≪ WAL < BRH < ALR
< MLL < ILS = ALY for P, and BRH showed a large tendency of
removal extent in all samples. The orders to which the extent of removal
among the gangue components examined increased as Si < Al <
P, and it was found that this treatment method is more effective for
Al and P removal than the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment. Figure 6 illustrates the
relationship between Si, Al, and P removal amounts. Although there
is some scattering, the negative and positive correlations were observed
for Si versus Al, Si versus P, and Al versus P in all samples, except
for INL. The correlation constant between Si versus Al increased due
to increasing extent of Si removal, compared with Figure 3. This result may show that
Si exists as nonassociated form with Al and P and supports the hypothesis
about the P form, such as P exists with an Al-associated form, as
is mentioned above. Table 5 summarizes the yields, pore properties, and Fe forms in Roasting/H2O_SC samples. The yield decreased to 80–89%, and the
order closely corresponded with that of LOI. The specific surface
area decreased from 15–175 m2/g of Roasting/H2O_RT samples to <1 to 15 m2/g for Roasting/H2O_SC samples treated at 300 °C. Similar decreases were
observed for the pore volume and NaOH hydrothermal treatment (Table 2). Although the amorphous
Fe was observed from almost all Roasting/H2O_RT samples,
the Fe form was Fe2O3 for all Roasting/H2O_SC samples. These results
show that sintering Fe species and crystallization were also occurring
during hydrothermal treatment with a Na-containing solution. Figure 7 shows the difference
between the extent of gangue removal from Roasting/H2O_SC
and Roasting/H2O_RT samples to investigate the effect of
hydrothermal treatment on gangue removal. As seen in Figure 7, the extent of Si removal
tended to increase for Roasting/H2O_SC samples, and a slight
increase in the extent of P removal was found for all samples, except
for WAL and INL. The slight decrease of the Al extent occurs due to
analytical errors. In conclusion, this combination of treatment can
improve Si and P removal in the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment.
It is considered that the removal of Si and P by a Na-containing solution
occurs due to a reaction between Si or P species and Na species to
form a water-soluble species during hydrothermal treatment.25

In the
present work, the hydrothermal treatment temperature of
300 °C was mainly used because the NaOH solution damages (causes
corrosion) the SUS reactor in repeating experimental trials. However,
it is important to clarify the effect of temperature on the behavior
of gangue removal in the Roasting/H2O_SC treatment. Therefore,
the ALY roasted sample was made for hydrothermal treatment at each
temperature to clarify the effect of hydrothermal temperature on gangue
removal. Figure 8 presents
the temperature dependency on the extent of gangue removal from an
ALY roasted sample against temperature. The extent of Al and P removal
at room temperature (Roasting/H2O_RT treatment) was as
high as 60 and 70%, respectively, whereas that of Si was as low as
15%. When the temperature was raised to 100 °C, the extent of
P removal reached 85%, whereas those of Al and Si were constant with
those of room temperature. Although the extent of P and Al removal
did not change up to 300 °C, that of Si increased along with
increasing temperature and reached 70% at 350 °C. In addition,
the removal of Al increased at 300–350 °C and attained
75% at 350 °C. These results mean that Roasting/H2O_SC treatment above 300 °C is more effective for further gangue
removal than for temperatures below 300 °C if it is possible
to use a corrosion-resistant reactor. Although the relationship between
the amounts of Si, Al, and P removal was investigated, clear correlations
were not found as seen in Figures 3 and 6. Table 6 summarizes the yields, pore properties,
and Fe forms corresponding with the result of Figure 8. In addition, the changes in XRD patterns
of the Roasting/H2O_SC samples against hydrothermal temperature
are shown in Figure 9 and summarized in Table 6. The yield of Roasting/H2O_SC of ALY ranged from
80 to 84% and decreased with increasing temperature. This decreasing
occurs due to the removal of gangue. Although the specific surface
area (155 m2/g) of the Roasting/H2O_RT ALY sample
was constant until 200 °C, a drastic decrease was observed at
250–350 °C, and these values were lowered to 15 m2/g. On the other hand, the amorphous Fe form observed in Roasting/H2O_RT was changed to Fe2O3 above 250
°C due to the crystallization effect of the NaOH and hydrothermal
treatment, and the peak intensity increased with increasing temperature.
Therefore, it is concluded that this combination of treatments above
300 °C is effective for gangue removal, crystallization of Fe,
and decreasing pore of porous and amorphous Fe in iron ores obtained
using the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment.

Effect
of Calcination and Roasting Temperatures on Gangue Removal
To clarify the effect of calcination/roasting temperatures on gangue
removal, each treatment (NaOH hydrothermal, Roasting/H2O_RT, and Roasting/H2O_SC treatment) was carried out against
ALY samples (calcined and NaOH roasted at 350, 600, and 900 °C,
respectively). The result is shown in Figure 10. Table 7 and Figure 11 list the yields, pore properties, and Fe forms of samples
before and after each treatment. When the prepared ALY calcined at
350, 600, and 900 °C in air were supplied for 5 M NaOH hydrothermal
treatment (Figure 10a), the extent of Si removal tended to increase with increasing calcination
temperature, whereas that of Al and P were constant. The change of
the Fe form in samples before and after the NaOH hydrothermal treatment
was not observed as shown in Figure 11a,b. The specific surface area of all samples after
the NaOH hydrothermal treatment decreased from 25–100 to 10–20
m2/g. For the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment, all
the extent of gangue removal tended to increase with increasing NaOH
roasting temperature, as seen in Figure 10b. The peaks of attributable NaFeO2 completely disappeared in all samples after the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment (Figure 11c,d). In addition, the specific surface area increased to
80–155 m2/g, compared to calcined samples (25–100
m2/g), respectively. A slight increase in the extent of
Si and Al removal was observed for the Roasting/H2O_SC
treatment with NaOH roasting temperature, as shown in Figure 10c. The amorphous Fe form obtained
in the Roasting/H2O_RT sample was changed to Fe2O3 by the Roasting/H2O_SC treatment (Figure 11e), and the specific
surface area (80–155 m2/g) of the Roasting/H2O_RT-treated samples decreased to 10–15 m2/g. According to previous work, it is believed that a calcination/alkali
roasting treatment is effective for the transformation of leaching
solvent-insoluble gangue in an iron ore form to a soluble form by
a reaction in the gangue component or alkali compound during heat
treatment, resulting in an increased extent of removal during the
leaching process.16,24 In this study, the increasing
Si, Al, and P extent of removal with calcination and roasting temperature
were observed. It is, therefore, through the transformation (rearrangement
of the structure) of gangue with calcination and the roasting treatment,
which also occurs similar to the report mentioned above in the present
study, and the resulting extent of gangue removal increased during
each of these methods. On the other hand, it may be determined that
the effect of pore properties on gangue removal is smaller than that
of the calcination/roasting temperature for rearrangement because
the specific surface area of the sample prepared at 900 °C, which
showed the highest extent of removal for almost all treatments, is
low as well as the original ALY. Although it is concluded that nonalkali
and alkali roasting treatments are effective for the removal of gangue
from iron ore, a dramatic improvement with calcination/roasting at
600 and 900 °C was not found in this case. The low-temperature
treatment is more favorable than the high-temperature treatment for
the actual process; therefore, we used 350 °C as the main treatment
temperature in this study.

Removal of Gangue by Combination
of Alkali Roasting and NaOH
Hydrothermal Treatments
As shown in Figure 5, the extent of Si removal was as low as
below 50% by using the Roasting/H2O_SC at 300 °C treatment,
and that of Al also was below 70%. Therefore, in this section, the
effect of the combination of alkali roasting and 5 M NaOH hydrothermal
treatments (Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC) on gangue removal
was investigated to attain a high gangue removal. Figure 12 shows the gangue removal
extent of iron ores used by Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC at
300 °C treatment. This combination provided 65–97% of
Si and Al removal extents, and the extent of P removal also reached
above 80% for all samples, except for INL, which has the lowest P
content and the largest LOI. The highest removal extent was observed
for BRH, which has a high Fe content, Fe2O3 form,
low LOI, and low pore properties of iron ores used in this study. Figure 13 illustrates the
relationship between the amounts of Si, Al, and P removal by the Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC at 300 °C treatment. For only Al versus
P, a positive correlation was observed. Figure 14 shows the correlation between the amounts
of Si, Al, and P removal obtained in Figures 1, 5, and 11 and Table 2. Although there is some scattering, a good positive correlation
was observed for Al versus P, whereas the relationship was not found
for Si versus Al and Si versus P. It was therefore strongly estimated
that P exists as associated with Al in the iron ore. Table 8 summarizes the yields, pore
properties, and Fe forms. The yield decreased to 79–88% and
occurred due to the gangue removal. The Fe forms of amorphous Fe observed
in the Roasting/H2O_RT samples transferred to Fe2O3 in all samples. The specific surface area (15–175
m2/g) of Roasting/H2O_RT also drastically decreased
to 8–30 m2/g. Although the specific surface area
was greater than those of other treatments due to high extent of gangue
removal, the specific surface area was lower than the original iron
ores. Therefore, it is concluded that the low-grade ores used were
upgraded using the Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC treatment. Figure 15 presents the effect
of the 5 M NaOH hydrothermal treatment on gangue removal calculated
by the difference between the extent of gangue removal for the Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC treatment and the Roasting/H2O_RT
or Roasting/H2O_SC treatment. From the difference between
the Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC treatment and the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment (Figure 15a), the removal extent of Si, Al, and P increased by
25–75%, 15–45%, and 10–30%, respectively. This
increase may occur by the increasing contact area between the Na-containing
solution and iron ore compositions during hydrothermal treatment because
the specific surface area increased due to the dehydration reaction
of α-FeOOH and gangue removal for the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment. On the other hand, from the difference of the extent
of gangue removal from the Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC treatment
to that of the Roasting/H2O_SC treatment (Figure 15b), the extent of Si, Al,
and P removal increased by 5–50%, 10–50%, and 2–20%,
respectively, for the Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC treatment.
For the latter difference (Figure 15b), the increase in the extent of P removal was lower
than that of former (Figure 15a). These results show that the Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC
treatment is more effective for Si and Al removal than that of the
Roasting/H2O_RT and Roasting/H2O_SC treatments.
Now, although the reason why the extent of gangue removal increased
by using the Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC treatment compared
with the Roasting/H2O_SC treatment at 300 °C, the
secondary reaction among gangue components removed by the H2O treatment at room temperature of NaOH roasting samples, which remained
in the solvent during the Roasting_H2O_RT/H2O_SC treatment at 300 °C, may occur during hydrothermal treatment
of the Roasting/H2O_SC treatment. On other words, it may
be important to positively remove the gangue eluted by the water treatment
of the roasted ore and then perform a hydrothermal treatment by adding
a fresh NaOH solution again, such as the use of a flow-type reactor.
The clarity of the detail will be the subject of future work.

Conclusions
In the present study, we have examined the removal of gangue (Si,
Al, and P) from iron ores by a combination of alkali roasting and
hydrothermal treatments to attain a higher extent of gangue removal
than hydrothermal treatment with NaOH only. The effects of the combination
of each treatment (leaching at room temperature and hydrothermal treatments
of the roasted sample), iron type, physical properties, calcination
temperature on the extent of gangue removal were investigated to develop
an upgrading method for producing high-grade iron from low-grade iron
ore (limonite). Some findings are listed below.(1) When the iron ores used in the present
study were roasted with NaOH at 350 °C, α-FeOOH in limonite
transferred to NaFeO2. On the other hand, for roasted iron
ores, which inherently contained Fe2O3 in iron
ore, Fe2O3 and Na2CO3 were
observed after the roasting treatment.

(2) The higher extent of Al and P removal
than NaOH hydrothermal treatment was observed in H2O leaching
at room temperature of the prepared roasted samples (Roasting/H2O_RT), whereas that of Si was low for all samples, except
for BRH. After H2O leaching, the Fe form was amorphous
for all samples, except for BRH.

(3) The specific surface area significantly
increased after the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment for all samples
due to the dehydration of α-FeOOH during the roasting treatment
and gangue removal during H2O leaching.

(4) When roasted samples were supplied
for the hydrothermal treatment of H2O at 300 °C (Roasting/H2O_SC), the extent of Si and P removal increased compared to
the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment.

(5) The calcination and roasting temperatures
influenced the extent of gangue removal more during the NaOH hydrothermal,
Roasting/H2O_RT, and Roasting/H2O_SC treatments,
and the effect on the pore properties of the iron ore is lower than
those of the pretreatments above.

(6) When the NaOH hydrothermal treatment
was carried out against the samples after the Roasting/H2O_RT treatment, an extent gangue removal of above 70% was reached,
except for P in INL.



Experimental Section
Sample
Seven types of iron ore (BRH, WAL, ILS, MLL,
ALR, ALY, and INL) produced in various countries (Brazil, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Australia) were used. The fraction size is <150 μm. Table 1 shows the chemical
and physical composition and Fe forms of iron ores used. In X-ray
diffraction analysis for iron ores, Fe forms were α-FeOOH for
all samples, except for BRH and WAL, and the peaks of SiO2 and nonidentified species were also detected for BRH, ILS, MLL,
ALR, and ALY.25

Hydrothermal Treatment
The hydrothermal treatment was
carried out with an SUS316 made batch reactor (length, 100 mm; o.d.,
24 mm; thickness, 2 mm). The details of the experimental procedure
have been reported in ref (25). About 2.5 g of a sample and 7 mL of solvent were first
added into the reactor, the reactor was then pressurized with high-purity
He (99.9995%) to check for leakage and to replace the atmosphere in
the reactor. After the atmosphere in the reactor was replaced with
enough He, the reactor was heated to 150–350 °C in a fluidized
sand bath for 30 min. The change of pressure in the SUS reactor corresponded
with the general vapor pressure curve of water. After a holding period
of 30 min, the reactor was rapidly quenched in a water bath. The solid
and liquid phases were separated using the filtrate method, and the
former was repeatedly washed with distilled water until the pH of
the filtrate becomes neutral. The yield of the treated samples was
calculated based on the weight loaded into the reactor, and finally,
the treated weight was obtained after each treatment and listed by
iron ore basis (original sample basis). The distilled water or 5 M
NaOH was used for the hydrothermal treatment. Here, a slight loss
of solid phase occurs due to the sintering of the Fe species, which
is strongly adhered to the inner wall and the Fe of the reactor, during
hydrothermal treatment. In addition, almost no elution of iron was
observed in all treatment.

Alkali Roasting
A NaOH fraction
<150 μm, crushed
and sieved, was used for the alkaline roasting of the iron ores. NaOH
(1.44 g) was physically mixed with the iron ores at room temperature,
and the mixture was then heated at 10 °C/min up to 350, 600,
or 900 °C in air. It is well-known that dehydration of α-FeOOH
in limonite occurs above 300 °C, and the maximum specific surface
area is observed at 350 °C.25,26 When the temperature
was raised to 600 °C, the highest pore volume is found, whereas
the specific surface area decrease, and at 900 °C, both values
decrease.25 In this study, the above temperatures
were selected to investigate the effect of pore properties on gangue
removal. The leaching and hydrothermal treatments of the prepared
NaOH roasting samples were carried out as follows: (1) the sample
was leached with 7 mL of distilled water at room temperature for 30
min under a N2 atmosphere. The recovery of the solid phase
was the same as that in Hydrothermal treatment section. (2) The sample and 7 mL of H2O were added into
the SUS reactor, and the mixture was heated with the same conditions
as mentioned in Hydrothermal treatment section.
Here, the NaOH solution concentration in the SUS reactor with the
addition of H2O was adjusted to 5 M NaOH. (3) The sample
was first leached with distilled water in the same manner as (1) mentioned
above. Following this, then the sample, which was recovered and dried
at 108 °C for 12 h in N2, and 7 mL of 5 M NaOH were
added into the SUS reactor, and the reactor was then heated in the
same manner as that in Hydrothermal treatment section. In the present study, treatments of (1), (2), and (3) were denoted
as Roasting/H2O_RT, Roasting/H2O_SC (subcritical),
and Roasting_H2O_RT/NaOH_SC, respectively.

Characterization
The characterization was carried out
by using the N2 adsorption analysis (Quantachrome, Nova1200e)
and conventional powder diffraction (Shimadzu, XRD6000) methods. The
detail of the measurement condition has been described in our previous
report.25 Each element (Fe, Si, Al, and
P) content in the sample before and after treatment was measured by
an alkaline fusion method according to the Japanese Industrial Standard
method (JIS M8214), which employs the inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific, iCAP 6300 Duo) method.25,32
