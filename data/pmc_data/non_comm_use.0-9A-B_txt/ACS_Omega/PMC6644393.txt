BaTiO3 thin films were
deposited onto polycrystalline
Pt using a dip-coating technique, with annealing temperatures of 750–900
°C. To avoid film imperfections such as cracking or pinholes,
key conditions, including aging periods, water content, and stirring
speeds, were refined to produce a pinhole-free, uniform film with
some porosity. Whereas those coated a single time short circuited
during electrical characterization, this could be avoided in films
produced by multiple coating cycles. The effective permittivity of
a 600 nm BaTiO3 film was measured at 290 by fitting solid-state
impedance data in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz. Electrochemical
impedance with an aqueous electrolyte allowed evaluation of the porosity,
which remained fairly constant between 1 and 5 coating cycles. Using
this method, it was possible to estimate the effective permittivity
of the BaTiO3 itself as 374 and hence to evaluate the increase
in the effective permittivity that could be achieved by minimizing
porosity.

Introduction
Titanate perovskites
such as lead zirconate titanate (PbZrxTi1–xO3), strontium
titanate (SrTiO3), and barium titanate
(BaTiO3) are workhorse electroceramic materials. They have
various important electrical properties, including reports of relative
permittivities of 273 (1 kHz, 500 nm),1 475 (100 kHz, 600 nm),2 and 630 (1 kHz,
380 nm),3 in thin films. Applications include
high charge-density capacitors and dynamic random access memories.4 Capacitors based on such electroceramics are
ubiquitous energy storage devices in electronics applications, for
example, in surface-mounted multilayer capacitors and in larger capacitance
rolled devices.5,6

In most applications, electroceramic
materials are prepared by
conventional powder processing methods at high temperature. Sol–gel
processes are used extensively in silicate processing and find various
applications elsewhere, variously providing high purity, mild chemical
synthesis conditions, stoichiometric control, homogeneous doping,
porosity, and/or high optical quality.7 There are reports of sol–gel production of perovskite titanate
thin films using spin-coating8−10 or dip-coating,3,11−13 with sols typically stabilized by acetylacetonate,
acetate, and methoxyethanol. Film quality is often not discussed in
detail in the literature, but volume contraction of the coating during
drying can create internal stresses, which cause cracking and pinholes
(cracks that cannot propagate due to the film thickness being lower
than the critical stress intensity).14,15

Film
porosity is a critical factor for the production of dielectric
thin films for applications such as capacitive devices. If the film
is porous, electrode deposition techniques such as thermal evaporation
or sputtered electrodes can result in electrical short circuits. No
account is usually taken of porosity when calculating effective permittivity
values, and the permittivities measured in standard experiments using
solid samples and metal contacts are an average across the film as
a whole.16 There are many methods that
have been reported to reduce film porosity, such as the way the films
are dried (gaseous environment,17,18 calcination temperature,19 and duration20),
increasing the number of coatings in the film,21 the addition of dopants,22 the
concentration of water in acid-catalyzed sols,23 and the aging duration.24 In
many cases, for BaTiO3 thin films, multiple dipping and
annealing steps have been employed to fill in porosity in sol–gel
BaTiO3 films, and this process allowed electrical properties
to be measured.11 A review of the literature
(Supporting Information (SI), Table S1)
shows that when BaTiO3 films are made by sol–gel
deposition (whether spin- or dip-coating), electrical measurements
are only reported on films made with multiple coatings.3,9−11,16,25−27

Herein, a sol–gel dip-coating method
to produce BaTiO3 thin films on platinum is optimized to
remove pinholes and
cracks. These single dip films still short circuited when contacted,
and multiple dipping steps were used to achieve solid-state impedance
measurements. A new approach using electrochemical impedance in combination
with optical and electron microscopy has then been used to improve
the understanding of the porosity in the films, allowing the
effective permittivity of the BaTiO3 itself to be assessed.

Results
and Discussion
Sol–Gel BaTiO3 Film Optimization
The sol recipe used to produce BaTiO3 films was fairly
typical of those in the literature, with coordinating solvents and
a reaction moderator (acac) used to stabilize the reactive titanium
centers. The films were dipped onto Pt-coated silicon wafers. Grazing
incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the films fired at 750, 800,
850, and 900 °C (Figure 1) showed cubic BaTiO3 with lattice parameters of
4.0060(7), 4.0070(6), 4.0057(8), and 4.001(3) Å, respectively.
A typical literature value is 4.014 Å.28 The crystallite sizes were measured using the Halder–Wagner
method29 in PDXL software as 132 ±
11 Å across all temperatures, with no obvious trend with firing
temperature. However, at higher annealing temperatures, a Ba2Ti13O22 impurity was also found in the BaTiO3 films, so the work focused on the phase-pure BaTiO3 films, which were annealed at 750 °C.

at the indicated temperatures. Reflections due to cubic BaTiO3 are marked with Miller indices, (∼) indicates
Pt signals from the substrate, and (*) is the Ba2Ti13O22 impurity in the 900 °C sample.

The initial single dip BaTiO3 films contained a high
density of pinholes that became visible by eye during drying of the
gels and remained visible after the annealing step. Optical microscopy
(Figure 2a) showed
some delamination and exposure of the substrate in the center of the
pinhole. The delaminated region was shown by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Figure 2b) to
contain a series of short cracks, which then open up a little due
to the film shrinkage during drying. Presumably, these cracks do not
propagate across the film thickness as the film thickness is below
the critical stress of the material.14 The
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps showed fairly even
composition across the flakes of the material within the pinholes
and a 1:1 ratio of Ti to Ba (Figure 2c,d), suggesting that pinhole formation is not due
to local composition variations. This is supported by microfocus XRD
maps across pinholes, where only BaTiO3 and Pt were observed.

titanium, barium, and platinum, respectively), and quantification
of the EDS map (d, with values reported in SI, Table S2) of the region of a pinhole in an unoptimized single
dip BaTiO3 film annealed at 750 °C.

Pinholes are disadvantageous as they can cause
electrical shorting
and also have a significant influence on capacitance.30,31 This is because the air void has a relatively low polarizability
when compared to the intrinsic properties of the film; therefore,
large volume fractions of pinholes will significantly influence the
capacitance. Their formation has been attributed to poor substrate
cleaning,32−34 lack of grain coalescence,35 and solvent effects on the particulate species present within the
sol.36 A number of variations to our glassware
and substrate cleaning processes were trialed and had no clear effect
on pinhole density. Hence, variants in the sol composition and aging
were explored with the aim of reducing pinhole formation.(1) The amount of water
added to the sol
formulation to hydrolyze the titanium isopropoxide was varied. After
1 day of aging, the substrate was dipped into the four different sols
and then annealed at 750 °C. The film with the lowest number
of pinholes (SI, Figure S1) was produced
with 4 mL of H2O, and so this modification was then maintained.
The films produced with 4 mL of water contained larger particles than
those produced at lower water concentration (optical micrographs in
SI, Figure S2); this change has been attributed
to the degree of cross-linking and polycondensation occurring over
the defined aging period.

(2) The length of the sol aging period
is also a vital control parameter as the number and size of oligomers
formed within the sol will vary with the amount of time over which
hydrolysis and polycondensation occur. As the film aging period gradually
increased from 1 to 8 days, the pinhole density gradually fell (SI, Figure S3), with a very low density of pinholes
observed with aging periods between 6 and 8 days. With these longer
aging periods, the films developed small pores that could be observed
under the microscope (distinct from the large pinholes described above
that are visible to the naked eye), but also increased in overall
density (SI, Figure S2). This is consistent
with an increase in sol viscosity.37 On
day 9, the sol had started to gel, and coatings produced from were
not smooth or well adhered.

(3) The final modification was to the
stirring speed during aging, which was increased from 250 to 1000
rpm. This improved reproducibility of the aging periods, and reduced
the period taken to produce sols that did not generate pinholes by
2–3 days compared to that at 250 rpm (SI, Figure S3). At this stirring speed, full gelation did not
occur even after 9 days, although after 7 days cracks appeared on
the film due to high-viscosity sols (SI, Figure S3b).



The faster stirring speed
resulted in shorter aging periods to
produce pinhole-free films but also reduced the size of the pores
that occur in these films (SI, Figure S2). Further films were produced using 4 mL of water and stirred at
1000 rpm for 3–4 days.

Films Produced with Multiple
Dippings
Even after the
sol synthesis and aging process had been optimized to avoid pinhole
formation, attempts at electrical measurements of the single dip BaTiO3 films always failed. Various methods were used to contact
the film top surface (evaporated gold, gallium, gallium–indium
eutectic), but short circuits to the platinum film substrate were
always observed. Hence, even the small pores observed in the microscopy
are sufficient for these media to penetrate the film. As noted in
the Introduction, multiple dippings have been
claimed to fill in the pores and allow electrical measurement,11 and in all cases where electrical properties
have been reported, multiple coating cycles have been employed (SI, Table S1). Hence, films were produced using the
optimized dip conditions described above with multiple rounds of dipping
and firing. In these films, GIXRD (Figure 3) showed the cubic BaTiO3 to have
a constant lattice parameter (4.008 ± 0.003 Å) and crystallite
size (160 ± 20 Å); Pt substrate signals were obscured by
these thicker films.

Figure 3 GIXRD (1° incident angle) of BaTiO3 films
deposited
on Si/Pt substrates and annealed at 750 °C. Reflections due to
cubic BaTiO3 are marked with Miller indices. The inset
shows photgraphs of the films.

The films were smooth to the eye, but under the optical microscope
changes to the microstructure were observed (Figure 4). Over the first three layers of BaTiO3 deposited, the pores became smaller but were more numerous.
In layer 4 cracks started to appear, and in layer 5 these had propagated
to a network of narrow cracks, leaving ∼5 μm BaTiO3 islands. The film thicknesses progressively increased from
300 nm with 1 dip and anneal cycle, to 550, 600, 930, and 1250 nm
with 2, 3, 4, and 5 cycles, respectively. The cross-sectional SEM
images (SI, Figure S4) also showed further
evidence of the porosity present between the BaTiO3 grains,
which did not appear to have been mitigated by the multiple dipping
process.

cycles: (a, b) 2 layers; (c, d) 3 layers; (e, f) 4 layers; (g, h)
5 layers.

Solid-State Impedance Measurements
Single dip films
suffered from short circuits when top contacts were applied due to
the metal penetrating through the pores. The most continuous BaTiO3 films produced in this study were with two or three dip and
anneal cycles, and with further cycles, cracking of the films started
to develop. Solid-state impedance measurements were focused on the
films produced with three coating cycles. Gold was evaporated onto
the surface of one of these films using a mask with multiple contact
diameters (0.420, 0.515, and 0.615 mm; SI, Figure S5). The gold contacts were used as the top contact and the
Pt film as the bottom contact. Impedance spectroscopy was then carried
out with a frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 Hz and a sinusoidal amplitude
of 500 mV on three gold pads of each size. The Nyquist and Bode plots
(Figure 5) show a capacitive
response consistent with an equivalent circuit of a resistor and a
constant phase element (CPE) in series; this equivalent circuit was
used to fit all of the solid-state data. The phase angle was just
below 90° throughout the frequency range, the modulus gradient
was −0.99, and the magnitude of the capacitance was scaled
accordingly with the pad area. CPE components are often used to model
non-ideal capacitance (e.g., inhomogeneities),38 but note that the modulus gradient close to −1 indicates
that the capacitance measured here was close to ideal over the modeled
frequency range. The electrical response was highly reproducible across
each pad area, with the electrical noise reducing with increasing
pad area. Using the parallel plate equation (C = Aεε0/d, where C is capacitance in F, A is pad area in m2, ε0 is the permittivity
of free space in m–3 kg–1 s4 A2, ε is the effective permittivity of the
film, and d is its thickness in meters), the effective
permittivity of the films in each of these regions was then calculated.
These were remarkably consistent (SI, Table S3), with an average value of 290 and all solid-state measurements
resulting in effective permittivities between 270 and 299 (data fitted
in the range 500 Hz to 1 MHz). Capacitance and effective permittivity
both decreased gradually with increasing applied frequency (SI, Figure S6 and Table S4).

data for a BaTiO3 thin film produced by dipping and annealing
at 750 °C three times: (a, b) 0.4 mm; (c, d) 0.5 mm; (e, f) 0.6
mm diameter contact areas. Each experiment was performed on three
gold pads of the same diameter to confirm reproducibility (the fittings
are shown in SI, Figures S7–S9).

Electrochemical Impedance
Measurements
Multiple sol–gel
coating cycles have previously been reported to fill in the pores
in BaTiO3 films and hence allow the solid-state impedance
to be measured.11 However, Figure 4 indicates that some porosity
is present even in the films that have been coated multiple times.
Cyclic voltammograms of films produced with 1, 2, or 3 dip and anneal
cycles in acid electrolyte (Figure 6) all showed the same features typical of platinum
electrochemistry. Figure 6 shows characteristic hydrogen adsorption (Hads) and hydrogen desorption (Hdes) peaks in the potential range between −0.6 and −0.4
V.39 The current densities of these features
are enhanced by coating with the porous film, which can be attributed
to the effect of the pore structure40 and
to the thermal processing close to the platinum Tammann temperature.41

Figure 6 Cyclic voltammograms of BaTiO3 thin films produced
on
a Si/Pt substrate with 1, 2, or 3 cycles of dipping into a sol followed
by firing at 750 °C and of a blank Si/Pt substrate pre- and postannealed.
1 cm × 1 cm regions were defined using nail polish; the scan
rate was 100 mV s–1. A Pt gauze counter electrode
and a Hg/HgSO4 reference electrode were used with a nonaerated
1 mol dm–3 H2SO4 electrolyte.

An electrochemical impedance study
was undertaken in 0.5 M K2SO4 at 0 V versus
Hg/HgSO4 (cyclic voltammogram
available SI, Figure S10) with the aim
of ascertaining how large an effect the porosity has on the capacitance.
A comparison between the Pt film substrate and the substrate with
a BaTiO3 thin film produced with a single dip and anneal
cycle is shown in Figure 7. Unsurprisingly, the bare substrate shows a much lower charge
transfer resistance (smaller semicircle in the area normalized Nyquist
plot) than that of the resistive BaTiO3 film. The Bode
plots (Figure 7) show
purely resistive behavior at high frequencies due to the solution
resistance and mainly capacitive behavior from 0.1 to 1000 Hz. At
low frequency, the response goes back to a resistive behavior modeling
the film resistance and the solution resistance. The Bode plots for
the bare substrate and the film are almost identical, with only a
shift along the frequency axis resulting from the resistive component
of the BaTiO3 film.

Figure 7 Nyquist (left) and Bode (right) plots
of the electrochemical impedance
data for a Pt film substrate and a BaTiO3 thin film produced
by dipping and annealing at 750 °C. Data were collected in 0.5
mol dm–3 K2SO4 (20 mL) with
a Pt gauze counter electrode and a Hg/HgSO4 (sat. K2SO4) reference electrode. A sinusoidal potential
with 10 mV amplitude was applied at frequencies from 0.1 MHz to 10
mHz. (a) Nyquist plot using data normalized to the exposed surface
area of the substrate or film, (b) Bode plot without this normalization,
and (c) equivalent circuit used in data fitting, where Rs is uncompensated solution resistance, Cdl is double-layer capacitance, CD is dielectric capacitance, and RD is dielectric resistance (pore resistance was discounted).

A porous dielectric film is expected
to exhibit two parallel impedances
associated with transport through the dielectric and the pores. The
dielectric part is expected to contain parallel dielectric capacitance
and resistance components, whereas the pores should exhibit a double-layer
capacitance from the platinum surface in series with a pore resistance
(SI, Figure S11). A series of films that
had been dipped and annealed between 1 and 5 times were studied with
different areas of the film exposed to the electrolyte. Nyquist and
Bode plots for a series of samples with nominally increasing deposit
thicknesses are shown in SI, Figure S12. The Nyquist plots only show partial arcs from near the origin to
the low-frequency parallel resistance, scaling inversely with the
sample area. The Bode plots all show a linear slope of −0.95
in modulus and a constant phase angle of around 85° from about
1 Hz to 1 kHz, signifying a capacitance (−1/2πfZ″) on the order of 100 μF and scaling with
the sample area. At frequencies below 1 Hz, a lowering of both the
phase angle and modulus suggests a parallel “leakage”
resistance in the range of MΩ, which can be attributed to the
redox behavior of impurities such as oxygen in solution. At frequencies
higher than 100 Hz, the phase angle decreases to almost 0, coinciding
with a leveling off of the impedance to constant values of just a
few ohms. The latter value corresponds well to the estimated series
resistance of the electrolyte.

We conclude that the effects
of a complex porosity prevent a resolution
of the capacitance into Cdl and CD, and the equivalent circuit is effectively
reduced to that shown in Figure 7, where the capacitances are effectively placed in
parallel across the same leakage resistor, and the solution resistance
is in series with all other components. The data are provided in SI, Figure S12, with fits shown in SI, Figures S13–S17, and the fitted parameters
in SI, Table S5. The CPE in this case was
used to account for the depression of the semicircle, which can be
attributed to the energetic heterogeneity due to the random geometric
distribution of the two capacitances.42 An alternative approach to fit the data is the use of random R–C networks.43,44 Capacitance values varied between 6 and 11 μF cm–2, with similar values throughout and no obvious trend in the values
(Figure 8). An obvious
conclusion from these data is that the exposed Pt surface area is
similar in all films and hence pores are not filled in during multiple
coating cycles. The ability to measure solid-state impedance
on such samples must be due to increasing thickness of the films and
increasing tortuosity of the pores, resulting in a lower tendency
for the evaporated gold, or other contact material, to penetrate to
the substrate surface.

The broken line is a guide to the eye.

Discussion
The effective permittivity of the BaTiO3 films of 290
that was derived from the solid-state impedance is significantly higher
than that of air (effective permittivity = 1), and so it is reasonable
to assume that the pores in the films contribute a negligible amount
to the measured capacitance. The Pt double-layer capacitance determined
by fitting the data in Figure 7 was 34.8 μF cm–2, significantly higher
than the overall film capacitance determined from Figure 5 of 0.43 μF cm−2. The capacitance of the BaTiO3 films measured by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy, of ∼8 μF cm–2, shows a mixture of Pt double-layer capacitance due to electrolyte
ingress through the pores and capacitance due to the BaTiO3 film. Considering both types of impedance data together, it is possible
to evaluate the relative contributions of these two capacitances in
the electrochemical impedance and hence to delineate the effect of
the porosity on the effective permittivity of the films.

For
the three dip films, where we have overall film capacitance
data from the solid-state impedance, subtracting the overall film
capacitance (0.43 μF cm–2) from the electrochemical
capacitance (8.26 μF cm–2) provides a double-layer
capacitance contribution of 7.83 μF cm–2.
Dividing this value by the Pt double-layer capacitance of a bare Pt
film (34.8 μF cm–2) yields an overall pore
area of 22.5% of the film surface. This means that the BaTiO3 measured in the solid-state impedance only covered 77.5% of the
surface and the effective permittivity of the BaTiO3 itself
is higher than that of the film overall, with a value of around 374.
Hence, if sol–gel coating processes could be refined to avoid
all porosities, an increase in permittivity of the films of around
29% would be feasible.

Conclusions
Sol–gel BaTiO3 films have been optimized to minimize
cracks and pinholes by modifying the water content, aging time, and
stirring speed during aging. The resultant films are optically smooth
and continuous, but do have a significant degree of porosity. After
multiple cycles of coating and annealing, it was possible to measure
the overall film permittivity. These films were found to retain significant
porosity, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was demonstrated
to be a useful technique in such systems to probe the impedance associated
with both the pores and the film material. This approach could be
powerful in evaluating the effect of porosity on the properties of
electroceramic films and in optimizing deposition processes to minimize
porosity effects.

Experimental Section
All of the
reagents were used without further purification. 2-Methoxyethanol
(99.8%), acetylacetonate (>99%), titanium isopropoxide (97%), and
barium acetate (99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as
received. Glacial acetic acid (>99%) and potassium sulfate (99%)
were
purchased from Fisher Scientific. Deionized water was produced with
a Purelab Options, ELGA LA620 deionizer.

The preparation of
BaTiO3 precursor sols was based on
a previous report (SI, Figure S18).13 Ti(OiPr)4 (2.618 g, 9.21 mmol) was added to a mixture of methoxyethanol (23.505
g, 309 mmol) and acetylacetone (1.508 g, 15.6 mmol) under N2 in a dry bottle. In a separate bottle, Ba(OAc)2 (2.353
g, 9.21 mmol) was dissolved by stirring in concentrated acetic acid
(15 mL, 262 mmol); then, H2O (1–4 mL, 55.5–222
mmol) was added. The Ba(OAc)2 solution was added dropwise
to the Ti(OiPr)4 solution under
a N2 flow. The sol was then sealed in the bottle and allowed
to stir at 250 or 1000 rpm over periods ranging from 1 to 14 days
depending on water and acetic acid contents.

Sols were deposited
onto dry 90 nm Pt-coated Si(100) substrates
(20 mm × 30 mm; Ti adhesion layer; ECS Partners Southampton,
cleaned by sonicating for 15 min each in acetone, ethanol, isopropyl
alcohol, and deionized water). Substrates were dipped into the sol
at a 30 mm s–1 immersion speed, held for 30 s, and
then withdrawn at 40 mm s–1 and left to dry for
10 min (NIMA Technology 5.20 dip-coater). The films were then placed
into a crucible and fired at 750 °C for 40 min (ramp rate of
1 °C min–1 and cooling at 5 °C min–1).

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction was collected
using a Rigaku
Smartlab diffractometer with a parallel beam of Cu Kα X-rays, incident angle of 1°, and a DTex250 1D detector. Rietveld
refinement was carried out using the Rigaku PDXL2 package. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDS) were performed on a JEOL JSM6500F microscope with an Oxford
Instruments INCA x-sights EDS/EDX detector. Optical images were taken
on a Nikon Eclipse optical microscope.

Solid-state impedance
measurements were performed with an Agilent
4294A Precision Impedance Analyser. Gold top electrodes of various
diameters (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mm) were evaporated onto the BaTiO3 thin film. The Pt of the Si/Pt/BaTiO3 substrate
was then contacted as the working electrode. The sinusoidal potential
amplitude was 500 mV, and the measurement frequency was from 1 MHz
to 100 Hz. Data were fitted with ZView (Scribner Associates Inc).

Electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out using a
Biologics SP-150 potentiostat. An area of the BaTiO3 thin
film was defined by masking the surrounding area and film edges with
an insulating medium (nail polish). The BaTiO3 thin-film
working electrode was then submerged into 0.5 mol dm–3 K2SO4 (20 mL) with a Pt gauze counter electrode
and a Hg/HgSO4 (sat. K2SO4) reference
electrode. A sinusoidal potential of 0 V versus Hg/HgSO4 with 10 mV amplitude was applied at frequencies from 1 MHz to 10
mHz. The subsequent Nyquist plots were fitted using ZView to an appropriate
equivalent circuit model giving the capacitance and resistance values.
