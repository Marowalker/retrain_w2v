Layered CaTaN2 and MgTa2N3 and
cubic Mg2Ta2N4 were prepared by direct
solid state reaction from the binary nitrides Ta3N5 and A3N2 (A: Mg, Ca). CaTaN2 showed a slight Ca deficiency (0.11 moles per formula), and a monoclinic
distortion from previously reported R3̅m symmetry, with space group C2/m and cell parameters a = 5.4011(2), b = 3.1434(1), c = 5.9464(2) Å and
β = 107.91(3)°. Ca2+ and Mg2+ deintercalation
was investigated in the three compounds both chemically and electrochemically.
No significant Mg2+ extraction could be inferred for MgTa2N3 and Mg2Ta2N4, neither after reaction with NO2BF4 nor after
electrochemical oxidation at 100 °C in alkyl carbonate electrolytes.
Rietveld refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of chemically
oxidized Ca0.89TaN2 indicates a decrease of
the Ca content to 0.34 concomitant to the disappearance of the monoclinic
distortion and expansion of the interlayer space from 5.658 to 5.762
Å, space group R3̅m and
cell parameters a = 3.1103(1) and c = 17.287(1) Å. Deintercalation in this compound was also achieved
electrochemically at 100 °C. Results of density functional theory
calculations seem to indicate that reaction mechanisms for CaTaN2 oxidation additional and/or alternative to deintercalation
are taking place, which is likely related to the loss of crystallinity
observed upon oxidation and the irreversibility of the process.

1 Introduction
The
transition from mono- to multivalent ion-based batteries is
a key strategy to substantially enhance the energy density of currently
available battery technologies, especially if metal anodes can be
used.1 This concept becomes particularly
attractive if earth-abundant and nontoxic metals are used as the overall
battery technology would benefit from reduced cost and lower environmental
impact. Ca and Mg are the fifth and eighth most abundant elements
on the earth’s crust, respectively, and the metals display
theoretical volumetric energy densities of 3833 and 2073 mA h/mL,
significantly larger than that of graphite, which is used as the negative
electrode material in most commercial lithium ion batteries (∼800
mA h/mL).2 On the positive electrode side,
divalent charge carriers would enable to double the capacities when
compared to single valent ones for the same amount of reacted ions.
Alternatively, reaction of only a half of the ions would be needed
to achieve the same capacity. These prospects have been prompting
increased interest from the scientific community, with Mg batteries
having deserved the most attention so far.1 Progress in this topic is difficult, as significant bottlenecks
exist both at a fundamental and technical level, and the understanding
of the multivalent battery chemistry is still elusive in many aspects.
Indeed, know-how gained in the development of Li-ion batteries cannot
be directly imported and even a reliable electrochemical full cell
setup is missing.3 On the crystal chemistry
side, unraveling materials allowing fast and reversible ion mobility
is a major challenge to address. The main issues arise from the high
polarizing character of multivalent ions inducing strong Coulombic
interactions within the electrode host framework and high (de)-solvation
energy barriers, which dramatically affect the electrode intercalation
kinetics and power performances. The use of Mo6S8–ySey (y = 1, 2) Chevrel phases exhibiting fast and reversible Mg2+ migration as positive electrode materials represents a milestone
in Mg battery chemistry,4 despite its redox
potential being rather low. A vast array of other materials, including
layered and spinel oxides, chalcogenides, Prussian blue analogues,
vanadates, silicates, and polyanionic phosphates, have been studied,
but none of them has resulted in suitable performance.1 Calcium systems are even less explored, as the feasibility
of reversible calcium plating/stripping got only recently unveiled.5,6 Encouraging results have been achieved with traditional layered
materials such as TiS2, for which reversible insertion
of Ca2+ at 100 °C has been recently demonstrated.7 Traditional layered oxides such as V2O5 and MoO3 have been recently revisited for
applications in Ca batteries: while poor (if any) Ca2+ intercalation
has been proved in V2O5,8 reversible electrochemical activity has been reported for MoO3.9 Calcium transition metal ternary
oxides have also drawn increasing attention: while too high Ca2+ migration barriers were determined for CaMoO3 and CaMn2O4,10 electrochemical
extraction of Ca2+ from 1D Ca3Co2O6 was achieved at high potential (3.2–3.6 V vs
Ca), encouraging further optimization of the cathode and electrolyte
compositions to achieve reversibility of the process.11

Within this research context, we decided to further
explore non-oxidic
compounds, turning our attention to ternary AxTayNz (A: Mg, Ca) tantalum nitrides. As compared to transition metal oxides,
nitrides exhibit analogous crystal chemistry and a higher degree of
covalency of the metal–anion bonds, which results into unique
chemical, magnetic, and optical properties.12 The high covalency of transition metal nitrides can be conceived
as a tool to mitigate coulombic interactions with multivalent ions
and hence facilitate their solid state migration. Furthermore, the
high electronic conductivity exhibited by several transition metal
nitrides could play a key role in promoting fast multivalent ion migration
kinetics, in agreement with what has been recently evidenced for the
MgxZr2S4 thiospinel
phase,13 exhibiting, despite its large
unit cell volume and almost zero-strain upon insertion, lower Mg2+ diffusion coefficient than the MgxTi2S4 phase14 as a consequence of its much lower electronic conductivity. While
covalency is also expected to result in a penalty in the redox operating
voltage, this can be in principle compensated by the proper selection
of transition metal redox centers. Although few reports on the study
of ternary alkali transition metal nitrides as Li-ion battery electrode
materials exist,12,15 such compounds have not been
considered for multivalent technologies, the only exception being
MgMoN2, for which Mg2+ extraction was not possible.16 Among the available alkaline earth metal transition
metal nitrides, the ternary A–Ta–N (A: Ca, Mg) system
represents an interesting playground for research, as the electronic
configuration of tantalum allows in principle to explore a broad spectrum
of phase compositions, with potentially high operating voltage and
high specific capacities. Hexagonal Mg1–xTa2+xN3 and cubic Mg2.6–xTa2+xN3 phases were originally prepared by Brokamp and Jacobs
by solid state reaction between Mg(NH2)2 or
Mg3N2 and Ta3N5.17 Analogously, CaTaN2 was synthesized
by Disalvo et al.18 from Ca(NH2)2 and Ta3N5 and suggested to have
rhombohedral symmetry, being isostructural to α-NaFeO2.

Herein, we present a study of such phases prepared from Ta3N5 and binary nitrides A3N2 (A: Mg, Ca) instead of the alkaline earth amides as reactants, and
determination of the crystal structure for the calcium compound. The
feasibility of Ca and Mg ion extraction from CaTaN2, MgTa2N3, and MgxTa2N4 was studied both chemically and electrochemically.
Finally, in light of the results achieved, the feasibility of Ca deintercalation
form CaTaN2 is also investigated using first principles
calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) approximation.

2 Results and Discussion
The achievement of ternary transition
metal nitrides is far from
being trivial, as high temperatures and prolonged treatments are needed
in order to obtain crystalline samples and nitrides are inherently
less stable than oxides due to their lower free energies of formation.26−30 In the synthesis of alkaline or alkaline earth transition metal
nitrides, these long thermal treatments may result in significant
losses of the most electropositive metal, which trigger the control
over the product composition. The list of the ternary Ca and Mg tantalum
nitrides studied in this work and of the experimental conditions employed
for their synthesis is given in Table 1, together with the synthetic methods previously reported.

2.1 Magnesium
Tantalum Nitrides
2.1.1 MgTa2N3
Attempts
to extract Mg2+ from this phase were carried out both by
chemical oxidation with NO2BF4 and by electrochemical
methods at room temperature and 100 °C. The characteristic potential
versus capacity signature of the MgTa2N3 electrode
(15% wt of Super P carbon) upon extended oxidation using an electrochemical
potential spectroscopy (EPS) protocol at 100 °C in Li three-electrode
cell [in 1 m LiBOB, ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene
carbonate (PC) 1:1 vol electrolyte] is shown in Figure 1C. A plateau-like region centered at about
4.2 V versus Li+/Li is observed in the oxidation profile,
with a capacity approaching 100 mA h g–1 (corresponding
to about 0.8 mol of virtually extracted Mg2+ considering
this as the only redox reaction taking place).

MgTa2N3 was obtained by reacting Mg3N2 and Ta3N5 in 1:2 mol ratio at 850 °C
for 20 h (see the Experimental Section for
details). The as-prepared sample consists of homogenous micrometric
aggregates of sub-micrometric and nanometric particles (see Figure 2B). The Mg/Ta ratio
determined from energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was 0.45
with distribution of both elements being homogeneous (see Figure S1D). The Rietveld refinement using synchrotron
X-ray diffraction (SXRD) patterns of the as-prepared sample is depicted
in Figure S1A. Refinement has been done
starting from previously reported structure with P63/mcm space group.31 The refined cell parameters are a = 5.2106(2)
Å and c = 10.4328(4) Å, which are in agreement
with those previously reported for Mg1–xTa2+xN3 (ca. 0 < x < 0.06). A Mg/Ta ratio slightly lower than 1/2 could
be inferred by the refinement of the occupation factors, while a nitrogen
content of 9.6% wt was obtained by elemental analysis (i.e., approaching
theoretical 9.8% wt value for MgTa2N3). The
crystal structure of MgTa2N3 is represented
in Figure 1A. It consists of (TaN2)3– layers between which both Mg2+ and Ta5+ ions
occupy octahedral holes. The structure exhibits partial cation ordering,
as Wyckoff position 4d is mainly occupied by Mg2+ ions
(i.e., for ca. 90% by Mg and 10% by Ta) while positions 2a and 6g
are occupied only by tantalum. Some of the peaks in the SXRD patterns
of the as-prepared sample (such as the 104 reflection at d = 2.258 Å corresponding to sin(θ)/λ = 0.2214 Å–1, see Figure S1B in the Supporting Information) exhibited a broad, asymmetric shape which prevented
proper fitting by Rietveld refinement, neither by considering micro-absorption
nor anisotropic strain effects. Such anisotropic broadening might
be due to the presence of stacking faults, in line with observations
in other layered compounds reported in the literature.32 This is also consistent with the observation
of streaking along [001]* in the electron diffraction patterns (see
Figure S1F in the Supporting Information), which indicate stacking disorder along c.

capacity (bottom axis) and vs moles of virtually extracted Mg2+ (top axis), calculated considering that this is the only
redox phenomenon taking place, for MgTa2N3 electrode
(with 15% wt of Super P carbon) in Li cell, with 1 m LiBOB, EC/PC (1:1 vol) electrolyte at 100 °C and C/100 rate
and corresponding ex situ X-ray powder diffraction patterns (D). Diffraction
patterns of the pristine and chemically oxidized samples are also
shown in (D) for comparison.

The ex situ X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the MgTa2N3 sample collected after the electrochemical and
chemical
oxidation tests are shown in Figure 1D. Compared with the pristine phase, neither peak shifts
nor formation of extra phases are observed, this pointing to insignificant
(if any) Mg de-insertion from MgTa2N3, even
under the severe oxidizing conditions employed and the electrochemical
capacity observed being related to side reactions most likely involving
electrolyte decomposition. Attempts to insert additional Mg2+ ions in the MgTa2N3 structure were carried
out by electrochemical reduction in Mg cells at 100 °C, using
a 0.3 M Mg(TFSI)2, EC/PC 1:1 electrolyte, which resulted
in very low capacities and no changes in the X-ray powder diffraction patterns.

2.1.2 Mg2Ta2N4
Mg2Ta2N4 was obtained
by solid state reaction at 1080 °C from Ta3N5 and Mg3N2 in 1:1 molar ratio (see the Experimental Section for details). The as-prepared
Mg2Ta2N4 exhibits a cation-disordered
cubic crystal structure (Figure 2A) with Mg and Ta in octahedral
coordination and cell parameter a = 4.35329(6) Å,
as determined by Rietveld refinement of the SXRD data (see Figure
S2A in the Supporting Information. Refinement
was made using Fm3̅m space
group as reported in ref (26)). An Mg/Ta ratio of about 0.8 and 0.7 was obtained by EDX
analysis, and N content
of 9.5%
wt was obtained from chemical analysis, in agreement with the nominal
composition. A typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph
of the Mg2Ta2N4 sample is shown in Figure 2B, displaying nanometric
particles forming micrometric size aggregates with distribution of
Mg and Ta being homogeneous (see Figure S2B).

powder diffraction patterns of pristine (a), chemically (b) and electrochemically
oxidized (c) and reduced (d) Mg2Ta2N4 samples.

When subjected to oxidation using
an electrochemical potential
spectroscopy (EPS) protocol at 100 °C in Li three-electrode cells
in 1 m LiBOB, EC/PC 1:1 vol electrolyte, the electrodes
containing Mg2Ta2N4 exhibited a potential
profile displaying a plateau around 4.2 V versus Li+/Li
and specific capacities close to 90 mA h g–1 corresponding
to Δx of virtually de-inserted Mg2+ of about 0.7 mol. However, no significant change in the X-ray powder
diffraction pattern was observed, neither after electrochemical nor
after chemical oxidation, which points at the amount of Mg2+ deintercalated being insignificant, if any, and the electrochemical
capacity observed being again related to side reactions. Attempts
to electrochemically reduce Mg2Ta2N4 in Mg cell were not successful either.

2.2 Magnesium Calcium Nitrides
CaTaN2 was prepared
by solid state reaction at 1080 °C between
Ca3N2 and Ta3N5 (see the Experimental Section for details) and was found
to be stable in ambient air. We initially attempted to fit the X-ray
powder diffraction pattern using the structural model previously reported
by Balbarin et al.18 in space group R3̅m.33 However, several diffraction peaks show a clear splitting [e.g.,
reflections 012, 015, 018 of R3̅m] indicating lower symmetry. As an alternative, we used the structural
model with monoclinic space group C2/m that was reported for NaxFeO2.25 This provided a better fitting of
the X-ray diffraction data and split reflections. The observed and
calculated X-ray diffraction patterns are plotted in Figure 3. The inset shows in detail
the peak at ca. 0.236 Å–1 corresponding to
1̅12/201 reflections in C2/m group and 015 reflection in R3̅m, emphasizing the need of reducing the symmetry from rhombohedral
to monoclinic. Results of the Rietveld refinement are listed in Table 2. This monoclinic
distortion might arise from Jahn–Teller effect (as reported
in other layered oxides34) or, most likely
in view of DFT results (see below), to vacancy/calcium ordering related
to Ca deficiency25,35,36 as typically occurs in the triangular lattice of Na sites in α-NaxFeO2-type compounds.37,38 Besides, the background of the pattern indicates presence of a relevant
amount of amorphous phase, which was quantified (by adding a 20% wt
of SiO2) to be about 25% wt (see Supporting Information).

distances: ⟨dTa–N⟩
= 2.15(3) Å; ⟨dCa–N⟩ = 2.46(1) Å.

The Ca–N and Ta–N bond distances (see Table 2) are consistent with ionic
radii values. The refinement of the occupation factors resulted in
a slight Ca deficiency, with Ca/Ta ratio being 0.89(1). The presence
of a minor impurity phase with main diffraction peaks at sin(θ)/λ
of ca. 0.208 and 0.246 Å–1 was also detected,
which may correspond either to CaO or TaN. A Ca/Ta ratio close to
1 was also inferred from EDX with distribution of both elements being
homogeneous (see Figure S5A), while a nitrogen
content of 10.5% wt was determined by combustion analysis which is
close (1.82 N per formula) to that expected for the stoichiometry
Ca0.89TaN2. These results are consistent with
previous findings by Balbarin et al. who observed slight calcium deficiency
and presence of TaN, TaN0.1, or Ca2TaN3 as secondary phases.18

The crystal
structure of Ca0.89TaN2 is represented
in Figure 4A. Ca and
Ta occupy alternating octahedral sites between close packed nitrogen
slabs. The ordered distribution of cations within the layers has been
reported to be at the origin of anisotropy of electrical resistivity.18

(b,c). (D) X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the pristine (a) and
chemically oxidized samples are also displayed in (D). (*) denotes
reflections corresponding to CaF2.

The as-prepared sample consists of micrometric aggregates
of nanometric
and sub-micrometric particles (Figure 4B) with homogeneous composition, as confirmed by EDX
analysis. Attempts to extract Ca2+ from this phase were
carried out, both by chemical oxidation reaction with NO2BF4 and by electrochemical methods. For the electrochemical
experiments, Ca0.89TaN2 was mixed with conductive
Super P carbon in 85:15% wt ratio and subjected to electrochemical
oxidation (de-insertion) tests in Ca metal cells under various conditions.
As no electrochemical activity could be observed at RT, additional
experiments were carried out at moderate temperature (100 °C). Figure 4C displays the characteristic
potential versus capacity profiles observed for Ca0.89TaN2 electrode at 100 °C and C/100 rate in Ca three-electrode
cell with Ca reference and counter electrodes, in dry 0.45 M Ca(BF4)2, EC/PC 1:1 vol electrolyte. The potential signature
displayed is the measured potential difference between the working
and the counter electrodes (each measured vs passivated Ca reference).
A full oxidation up to capacity values of about 170 mA h g–1 (corresponding to Δx mol of virtually extracted
Ca2+ ions of about 0.7) is reported in Figure 4C, together with an oxidation–reduction
limited to lower values of delivered specific capacity (i.e. about
0.3 mol of virtually exchange Ca2+ ions). A plateau centered
at about 4.5 V is observed upon oxidation with high polarization upon
further reduction, both using tape or powder electrodes. A variation
of the powder sample color from dark gray to light brown was detected
both after the chemical and electrochemical oxidation tests, reasonably
suggesting a variation of the tantalum oxidation state. The X-ray
powder diffraction patterns of Ca0.89TaN2 at
the end of the oxidation (de-insertion) process and after oxidation–reduction
are reported in Figure 4D, together with the patterns corresponding to the pristine phase
and the powder recovered after 10 h of reaction with NO2BF4 at 80 °C in acetonitrile (ACN).

Significant
loss of crystallinity is observed, especially for the
sample oxidized for longer time. An increase of the amorphous content
from about 25% wt in the pristine sample to 50% wt after oxidation
was estimated from Rietveld refinement of the XRD data, by using an
internal standard of SiO2 quartz (see Figures S3 and S4
in the Supporting Information). A strong
decrease of the integrated intensity of the 2̅02/111 reflections
(104 in the R3̅m cell) [sin(θ)/λ
= 0.219 Å–1, d = 2.285 Å]
is clearly detected after the oxidation (see Figures 4D and 5), together
with an increase in the intensity of the 001 reflection (003 in R3̅m cell) [sin(θ)/λ
= 0.089Å–1, d = 5.762 Å]
and changes in the relative intensities of 110/2̅01 [sin(θ)/λ
= 0.187 Å–1, d = 2.660 Å,
101 in the R3̅m cell] and
1̅11/200 [sin(θ)/λ = 0.194 Å–1, d = 2.570 Å, 102 in the R3̅m cell] reflections. An additional peak
is observed at sin(θ)/λ around 0.158 Å–1, which is assigned to CaF2 derived from BF4– decomposition side reactions. The patterns corresponding
to the chemically oxidized sample exhibit main peaks at values of
sin(θ)/λ of 0.087, 0.188, 0.195, and 0.219 Å–1 and can be fitted using a structural model with space
group R3̅m, with refined cell
parameters a = 3.1103(1) and c =
17.287(1) Å (see Figure 5 and Table 3). The stabilization of R3̅m structure in the chemically oxidized sample is consistent with the
disappearance of the ordered vacancy-Ca configuration in the interlayer
space, a feature well described in layered-LiMO2 materials
where the lithium content drives the stabilization of particular Li-vacancy
orderings and subsequent crystal symmetry changes.39,40 The changes in the cell parameters are similar to those observed
in α-NaFeO2 and NaVO2 during sodium deintercalation,41,42 which lead to layered phases with composition Na0.5MO2. Expanded c axis (as mentioned, interlayer
distance in Ca0.89TaN2, 5.658 Å would correspond
to a hexagonal c axis of 16.974 Å) resulting
from increasing coulombic repulsions as the amount of ions in the
interslab space decreases. The refined calcium occupancy for the chemically
oxidized sample is 0.34(2), which agrees with the Ca/Ta ratio of 0.4
obtained from XESD analysis. The poor crystallinity of the electrochemically
oxidized sample prevents reliable refinement of the Ca occupancy.
Nonetheless, the pattern is quite similar to the one of the chemically
oxidized sample with R3̅m symmetry
and cell parameters a = 3.107(1) and c = 17.363(5) Å, indicating a slightly larger expansion along c. The X-ray diffraction patterns of samples obtained by
reduction of oxidized Ca0.89TaN2 did not show
any additional change, which is a clear indication that calcium deintercalation
is an irreversible process. Interestingly, very similar behavior has
been reported for NaTaN243 which
was also oxidized chemically (in that case using NO2PF6) with significant amorphization and decrease in the relative
intensity of some peaks with respect to others. In that case, no Rietveld
refinement was possible even for pristine NaTaN2, despite
a hexagonal cell being suggested and hence no values for sodium occupancy
were available either. Yet, the c contraction together
with a gradual loss of crystallinity upon progressive oxidation was
clearly established. Moreover, all attempts to reintroduce sodium
in the structure were also unsuccessful. As for NaTaN2,
tantalum is in its highest oxidation state, the authors do speculate
that the redox reaction may involve nitrogen as well, despite not
being able to confirm this hypothesis. The elemental analysis of the
Ca0.89TaN2 sample after chemical oxidation revealed
a nitrogen content of 7.7% wt, that is slightly lower than the one
determined for the pristine phase (10.5% wt) while distribution of
Ca and Ta remains homogeneous (see Figure S5B).

Overall temperature factor B = 0.40(1) Å2. Agreement factors: χ2 = 8.26; Rwp = 12.7%; RBragg = 4.43%.

At this point, a legitimate
question was whether reversibility
of the deintercalation process may be prevented by large calcium desolvation
energies in the electrolyte used, as was suggested in the case of
Ca3Co2O6,11 or else the mechanism was more complex and involved some sort of
decomposition upon oxidation, which may well explain the progressive
amorphization.

In order to shed some light into this issue,
calculations have
been performed for the stoichiometric CaTaN2 and the hypothetical
de-inserted phase Ca0.5TaN2 (see relevant results
in Table 4). For CaTaN2, the monoclinic and hexagonal models yield similar total
energies, with a negligible energy difference of 3 meV/f.u. in favor
of the latter (note that the energy difference is within the error
range of the calculation). Interestingly, in both cases the optimized
structure shows six almost equivalent Ta–N distances excluding
the presence of a Jahn–Teller distorted Ta d1 cation.
This is in line with detailed band structure calculations,44−46 showing that in CaTaN2 the three t2g-like
Ta-based bands are practically degenerate, due to the very regular
octahedral coordination for the Ta atoms.

In order to probe the role of the Ca-vacancy
ordering in deviations
from the R3̅m symmetry, we
have considered a virtual composition Ca0.5TaN2 with C2/m symmetry Ca and vacancies
ordered in rows (see Figure 6A). Noteworthy, in the optimized structure of this material,
both the TaN and CaN octahedra are distorted (see Table 3), which is consistent with
the monoclinic distortion observed experimentally in the pristine
sample being driven by the Ca-vacancy ordering.47 Confrontation of the calculated data given in Table 3 to the experimentally
achieved values, (a = 5.4182(4), b = 3.1416(2), c = 5.9428(4) Å and β =
108.18(3)°) d(Ta–N) = 2.18(3) Å, d(Ca–N) = 2.47(2), are consistent with the Ca content
(x) in the as-prepared CaxTaN2 being between 0.5 and 1 as experimentally observed.

DOS of monoclinic CaxTaN2 with x = 1 and x = 0.5. The Fermi level is set

migration barrier for CaTaN2 (SG C2/m).

Upon Ca deintercalation
from CaTaN2, electrons should
be removed from the band structure. The calculated density of states
(DOSs) for CaTaN2 (Figure 6B) shows that the N(2p) and Ta(5d) states largely hybridize
below the Fermi level suggesting strong covalent bonding in within
the TaN2 layers. As previously reported,43−45 CaTaN2 is a bidimensional metal (no localized JT active Ta d1 cations) with the Ca ions ionically bonded to the (TaN2)2– layers. Two wide bands appear in the DOS: the
upper and partially filled band dominated by the Ta d-states and the
lower band (between −2 and −7 eV) which is mostly of
N p character. Ca deintercalation from CaTaN2 to form Ca0.5TaN2 would imply the upper band, this is to say,
the oxidation from the formal state Ta4+ to Ta5+. Beyond the Ca0.5TaN2 composition (or NaTaN2 for the analogous phase), Ca de-insertion would reduce the
occupancy of the lower N(2p)-band producing a large amount of holes
and in the end nitrogen oxidation with concomitant structural degradation.

Yet, and in line with the experimental findings discussed above,
a mechanism for CaTaN2 oxidation additional and/or alternative
to deintercalation should also be considered. Thus, one can postulate
possible oxidation/decomposition reactions for CaxTaN2 yielding other known phases in the Ca–Ta–N
system, which are the potential stable phases according to the calculated
phase diagram in the Materials Project database.48,49 The calculated total energies for such reactions are 1   2  

While CaTaN2 is predicted
as a stable phase in the ternary
Ca–Ta–N phase diagram at 0 K, the negative total energy
of reaction 2 reflects the thermodynamic trend
of Ca0.5TaN2 to decompose. Moreover, under the
severe oxidizing conditions employed, the formation of oxygen containing
alternative phases cannot be completely excluded either.

Finally,
it should be noted that deintercalation of Ca ions from
CaTaN2 would require them to migrate in the space between
the (TaN2)2– layers. The simplest pathway
for Ca diffusion in the structure is the octahedral–tetrahedral–octahedral
hopping mechanism in the Ca layer (see Figure 6C). The large calculated energy barrier (1.7
eV) is indicative of a hampered Ca diffusion. Thus, it seems that
other oxidation/decomposition reactions which may involve evolution
of N2 (as suggested by the decrease in N content from 10.5
to 7.7% revealed by EDX) are likely to occur instead or concomitant
to deintercalation. These would most likely be related to the progressive
amorphization observed upon oxidation.

3 Conclusions
Ternary phases in the Ca–Mg–Ta–N system with
different compositions and crystal structures can be easily prepared
by a proper tuning of the binary nitride precursors ratio and by using
excess amounts of the alkaline earth metal in order to compensate
its losses during the high temperature treatments. The extraction
of Ca and Mg ions from the ternary nitrides was attempted both by
chemically and electrochemically. Oxidation of MgTa2N3 and Mg2Ta2N4 could not be
achieved, with the observed electrochemical capacity arising from
parasitic side reactions involving the electrolyte, exacerbated at
100 °C when compared to RT. In contrast, oxidation of Ca0.89TaN2 was found to be possible both chemically
and electrochemically. Unfortunately, this process was found to be
irreversible. The differences observed in the behavior of Ca and Mg
phases cannot easily be rationalized, as the crystal structures are
significantly different. According to DFT calculations, the covalent
(TaN2)2– in the CaxTaN2 crystal structure might be oxidized to some
extent, while for Mg2Ta2N4, the disorder
of Mg and Ta ions would most likely disrupt the formation of an analogous
band structure.

Overall, the present work represents an additional
step in multivalent
cathode exploration. Indeed, despite the unsuccessful results, ternary
nitrides constitute an interesting alternative to oxides, as the electrons
compensating multivalent intercalation are donated to a wider band
arising from the strong covalent interaction between the N p states
and the transition metal ion, which, as inferred from DFT calculations,
may result in redox processes and hence lead to high energy densities.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
All
samples were prepared
in batches of 250 mg. Commercial Mg3N2 (Sigma-Aldrich,
>99.5%) and Ca3N2 (Sigma-Aldrich, >99.5%)
and
Ta3N5 were used as reactants. Ta3N5 was prepared by ammonolysis of Ta2O5 (Sigma-Aldrich, >99.5%), through two repeated treatments
at 850 °C for 15 h, under a NH3 flow of 600 cm3/min, using 300 °C/h heating rate and natural cooling
in the furnace. All the manipulations of the nitride reactants were
carried out in a glovebox under an Ar atmosphere.

CaTaN2 was prepared by mixing Ca3N2 and Ta3N5 using a 15% (w/w) excess of Ca3N2. For the synthesis of Mg2Ta2N4, Mg3N2 and Ta3N5 were
mixed in 1:1 stoichiometric ratios while a 1.2:2 ratio was used for
the preparation of MgTa2N3. After grinding,
the reactant powders were pressed into pellets at 10 ton and annealed
for 20 h under flowing N2 (Air Products, ALPHAGAZ, >99.9999%)
atmosphere. Temperatures of 1080, 850, and 1100 °C were employed
for the synthesis of CaTaN2, MgTa2N3, and Mg2Ta2N4, respectively, with
300 °C/h heating rate. After the thermal treatment, the samples
were naturally cooled in the furnace. All the thermal treatments were
carried out in Mo (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) crucibles inside a silica tube,
using Zr foil (Goodfellow, 99.2%) as sample holder caps and tube inlet
traps in order to avoid water and oxygen contaminations.

4.2 Structural, Morphological, and Composition
Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction data were acquired
using borosilicate glass capillaries of 0.3 or 0.5 mm diameter as
sample holders. Laboratory X-ray powder diffraction data were collected
using a Bruker D8 Advance A25 diffractometer in a Debye Scherrer configuration
equipped with Mo Kα1 radiation source (λ =
0.7093 Å) and Johansson monochromator. Synchrotron X-ray powder
diffraction (SXRPD) patterns were collected at the MSPD beamline19 of ALBA Synchrotron light source (Cerdanyola
del Vallès, Spain) using mythen bank of detectors with λ
= 0.6199 Å (MgTa2N3 and Mg2Ta2N4) or 0.41338 Å (CaxTaN2). The capillaries were rotated during data
acquisition. Rietveld refinements were performed using the program
FullProf.20

The amorphous content
of CaxTaN2 was determined by
full-quantitative analysis, adding to the samples a known amount (20%
wt) of purely crystalline SiO2 standard.21

N contents were determined by combustion analysis
in oxygen in
a Thermo Fisher Scientific instrument, heating the samples in oxygen
up to 1060 °C.

SEM images and EDX analyses were performed
by using an FEI Quanta
200 FEG microscope under high vacuum operating at 20 kV; secondary
and backscattered electron detectors were used. EDX elemental mappings
of Mg, Ca, and Ta were carried out over a representative area of the
samples and quantitative atomic ratios were inferred accordingly.

Selected area electron diffraction was carried out by using a JEOL
1210 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV, equipped
with a Gatan double tilt sample holder, with typically 20 crystals
being examined per sample. The powder samples were finely dispersed
in ACN and deposited as droplets on carbon-coated films supported
on copper grids.

4.3 Chemical and Electrochemical
Oxidation Tests
Chemical oxidation tests were performed by
reacting 200 mg of the
sample with NO2BF4 (Alfa Aesar, 96%) in 1:4
mol/mol ratio, in 50 mL of anhydrous ACN (Alfa Aesar, 98%). The reaction
was carried out under reflux, with continuous Ar bubbling within the
reaction vessel. After 10 h, the obtained dispersion was vacuum-filtered
and the collected powder was rinsed with anhydrous ACN and dried under
vacuum before being subjected to XRD analysis.

Electrochemical
oxidation tests were carried out in three-electrode Swagelok cells,
by using metal discs (Li, Mg, or Ca) as counter and reference electrode
and the active phase as working electrode either as a powder mixture
(85:15% w/w) with Super P carbon or as tape (with 80% wt of active
material, 10% wt of Super P carbon and 10% wt of polyvinylidene fluoride
binder). Al and stainless steel current collectors were used for the
working and reference/counter electrodes, respectively, and Whatman
glass fiber discs soaked in 0.6 mL of electrolyte solution were used
as separators.

LiPF6 (1 M) in EC/dimethyl carbonate
(DMC) (1:1 vol,
LP30 Sigma-Aldrich) and home-prepared 1 m LiBOB in
EC/PC (1:1 vol) electrolytes were used as electrolyte solutions for
the tests carried out in Li cells at RT and 100 °C, respectively.
The use of Li cell configurations for the tests aiming to oxidize
magnesium ternary nitride phases stems from the impossibility to achieve
Mg plating at the counter electrode in the alkyl carbonate-based electrolyte
employed. In contrast, the Li and Ca electrolytes used enabled, respectively,
Li and Ca metal plating at the counter electrode, thus allowing reliable
measurements. Dry (<50 ppm H2O), 0.3 M magnesium bis
trifluoromethane sulphonyl imide (Mg(TFSI)2, Solvionic,
99.5%) in a 1:1 vol mixture of EC (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and PC (Solvionic,
99.9%) was used as electrolyte for the reduction (magnesiation) tests
carried out in Mg cells. Ca metal three-electrode cells and 0.45 M
Ca(BF4)2 in EC/PC (1:1 vol) electrolyte with
H2O content <25 ppm were used for the electrochemical
tests on CaTaN2. Galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation
(GCPL) and EPS steps tests were run on a Bio-Logic VMP3 and MPG2 potentiostat/galvanostat.
Potential steps of 5 mV and current threshold of C/100 (equivalent
to intercalation of 1 mol of divalent ions in 100 h) and C/100 rate
were used in the EPS and GCPL tests, respectively. A temperature equilibration
of 5 h at the open circuit potential was completed prior to measurements.
The active material mass loadings were of about 3–4 mg.

Once tested, the cells were disassembled in an Ar-filled dry box
and the electrodes or active material powder were washed with DMC
solvent (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) before being dried and sealed
in borosilicate glass capillaries for the ex situ XRD measurements.

4.4 Computational
First-principles calculations
have been performed using the ab initio total-energy and molecular
dynamics program Vienna Ab initio Simulation Program (VASP) developed
at the Universität Wien.22 Total
energy calculations based on DFT were performed for CaTaN2 within the general gradient approximation, with the exchange and
correlation functional form developed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof.23 The interaction of core electrons with the nuclei
is described by the projector augmented wave method.24 The pseudopotentials used were Ca_sv (3s2p64s2), Ta_sv (5p66s25d3), and N (2s2p3). The energy cut off
for the plane wave basis set was kept fix at a constant value of 600
eV throughout the calculations. The integration in the Brillouin zone
is done on an appropriate set of k-points determined
by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme. A convergence of the total energy
close to 10 meV per formula unit is achieved with such parameters.
All calculations are spin-polarized. The initial positions for CaTaN2 models were taken from Na0.5FeO2 (C2/m) and delafossite-NaFeO2 (R3̅m).25 All crystal structures were fully relaxed (atomic positions,
cell parameters, and volume). The final energies of the optimized
geometries were recalculated to correct the changes in the basis set
of wave functions during relaxation. To investigate diffusion, the
energy barriers for Ca hops between adjacent octahedral sites in C2/m-CaTaN2 were calculated
using the nudged elastic band method as implemented in VASP. A Ca17Ta18N36 supercell was considered, where
one Ca atom has been removed leaving a vacant octahedral site. Constant
volume calculations were performed for five intermediate images. To
calculate the energy at the saddle point, cubic splines were fit through
the images along each hop.
