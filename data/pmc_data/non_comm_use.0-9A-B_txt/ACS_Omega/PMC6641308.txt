Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) porous carriers
were prepared by means
of ice templating of aqueous solutions containing of 90 kD and/or
16 kD PVA. The carriers were loaded with traces of a colored probe
(methyl orange) to screen their release properties, once immersed
in water. The carriers prepared from solutions containing 90 kD and
16 kD PVA resulted in intimate polymer mixtures, exhibiting physical
properties that stand in between those of the bare 90 kD or 16 kD
PVA end members. The freezing protocols employed were adapted to prepare
carriers textured in the form of either monolithic scaffolds (directional
constant freezing rate) or millimetric pellets (flash-freeze). Monolithic
carriers remain stable in aqueous solution, and the probe release
is governed by a swelling–diffusion mechanism. The kinetics
of probe release can be tuned from minutes to hours by either increasing
the total PVA content or the 90 kD-to-16 kD PVA ratio in the parent
solution. In contrast, pellets (millimetric carriers) immersed in
water release the probe on the scale of minutes, irrespective of the
PVA content or composition. However, the PVA content and the 90 kD-to-16
kD PVA ratio dramatically affect the stability of the carriers. Depending
on the formulation, these small carriers can develop swelling, erosion,
or eventually massive dissolution.

Introduction
Materials science is
permanently inspired by the requirements of
cutting-edge biomedical challenges. Tissue engineering, in particular,
demands smarter 3D scaffolds that are able to satisfy multiple requirements
in parallel, such as cell adhesion and guidance, tuned drug release,
and scaffold dissolution/biosorption.1,2 To ensure their
proper performance, their texture must be defined as an interconnected
pore network that guarantees an adequate mass transport with the surrounding
physiological media.2−6 In recent years, novel functional scaffolds7 and hydrogels based on a well-established biocompatible polymer
such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA in the following) were prepared by
freezing/thawing methods.8−10 More recently, their controlled
structuration by means of the ice-templating method, either from aqueous
solutions or hydrogels, resulted in oriented hierarchically textured
biomaterials.11 The versatility of this
method lies in the possibility of tuning the resulting scaffold texture
by several physiochemical and/or chemical parameters, such as the
solvent composition, the solute nature and concentration, the freezing
rate, and the temperature gradient. The method was also employed in
the structuration of mixtures of building blocks, including liposomes12 or micelles24 combined
with silica polymers and nanoparticles7 or even highly bimodal micro-/nanoparticle suspensions,25 that can effectively coalesce within a common
and well-interdispersed solid phase, after the solvent solidification.
Scaffolds with controlled pore texture (size, shape, distribution,
and orientation) can be obtained, even in the form of large macroscopic
robust pieces.6,11

In the case of PVA-based
scaffolds, several variables effectively
tune the texture, including the polymer mass fraction in the parent
solution, the average PVA molecular weight, and the freezing rate.
On this basis, diverse functional PVA scaffolds, loaded with antibiotic
agents13 or living cells,14 were created. Diverse approaches were reported for drug
loading, ranging from the inclusion of micro-/nanocrystal dispersed
within the pores15 or as intimate mixtures
with the scaffold polymer.16 In the first
case, drug release kinetics is mainly governed by the crystal dissolution
rate. In the second case, it is controlled by the scaffold stability
(swelling/erosion) and transport properties. However, in the latter
case, if the mass fraction of the loaded drug is significant with
respect to that of the host polymer, swelling and dissolution of the
whole scaffold can be severely modified with respect to the inherent
values.16 To overcome this uncertain scenario,
the present study explores the release properties of several PVA scaffolds
loaded with a negligible mass fraction of dye molecules to minimize
any effect of the probe on the porous texture of PVA and its inherent
stability in aqueous solution. To this aim, a family of PVA scaffolds
was structured by means of ice templating; scaffolds were prepared
employing aqueous solutions of PVA of two different molecular weights
(16 or 90 kD) as well as their binary mixtures, as an extra preparative
resource to tune the inherent stability and release properties.

Results
and Discussion
It is known that freezing structuring processes
follow several
common trends, ruled by the physics of phase segregation, irrespective
of the nature of the solvent and solute.17 Ice formation drives the segregation of every solute or colloid
originally dispersed in the aqueous phase toward zones in which the
ice is absent, giving rise to a hierarchical assembly defined by walls,
fibers, or bicontinuous arrays of matter surrounding empty areas where
the ice resided before sublimation, resulting in an organized 3D scaffold.
However, the existence of peculiar behaviors of each formulation imposes a careful experimental textural
screening.10,18 In the present case, as a first
step, solutions containing increasing amounts of PVA were submitted
to ice templating. In addition, each sample was prepared employing
PVA of 16 and 90 kD and a mixture (50 m/m %) of them. All samples
maintained the shape of the container in which the parent solutions
were confined prior to ice templating. Figure 1 presents the micrographs revealing the texture
of a series of samples prepared under representative conditions, ranging
from 5 to 10% in total PVA content, employing pure 90 or 16 kD PVA
as well as the binary mixture. Most of the samples can be interpreted
in terms of main parallel PVA walls, periodically connected by perpendicular
bridges resulting from dendritic growth of ice.19

Figure 1 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of PVA
scaffolds frozen at 5.5 mm min–1. Scale bar represents
5 μm for all images.

A closer view of the wall texture revealed an additional
level
of porosity with dimensions ranging from 50 to 300 nm (see Figure S1). For a given PVA total content, more
opened structures resulted from polymer with lower (16 kD or L) average
molecular weights. In the case of sample 5.0L100%, the dendritic bridges
cannot effectively coalesce with the nearby main walls, resulting
in a discontinuous multilayered structure. In contrast, bridges and
walls of sample 10.0L0% are fused enough to be almost indistinguishable,
resulting in a more intricate texture. In general terms, an increment
in the total PVA content in the parent solution reflected a significant
contraction of pore sizes, from the range of microns to a sub-micrometric
level (sample 10.0L0%). This tendency was also observed when PVA average
molecular weight increases. For any set of samples with a given total
PVA content, the binary 16–90 kD 50% mixtures denote an intermediate
behavior with respect to the bare end members. For a given PVA formulation
(0, 50, or 100%), samples with a total PVA content of 7.5 w/v % show
an intermediate behavior between the behaviors of 5.0 and 10 w/v %.

No attempts to quantify these tendencies were performed on the
present set of samples because the whole PVA scaffold suffered massive
contractions (up to one-third of the parent freeze volume) depending
on the formulation, creating severe artifacts to properly analyze
the pore size (see Figure S2). It was previously
reported that textural inhomogeneities can be present in the periphery
of the samples (skin effect) prepared under identical conditions.13 However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
inspection of the present samples revealed a homogeneous texture that
reaches the external surface parallel to the freezing direction, even
for samples frozen at high rates. The lack of the so-called skin effect
observed for related systems13 can be explained
in terms of occurrence of an ice crust externally developed around
the mold before immersion, driven by ambient moisture condensation/solidification.
This external ice shell seems to allow a better heat transfer once
immersed in the liquid N2 bath, preventing the development
of a texture gradient or skin (Figure 2).

Figure 2 FESEM images of sample 7.5L50% frozen at 5 mm min–1 (left) and 8 mm min–1 (right).
Scale bar represents
10 μm for both images.

To gain insights about the nature of the employed PVA combinations
on a molecular scale, representative MO-free samples of 5.0 w/v %
were inspected by both powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). The former revealed the inherent broad
signals of solid PVA, irrespective of the polymer molecular weight
of the sample or the freezing conditions (see Figure S3). All samples revealed a DSC trace consisting of
two main thermal endothermic events (see Figure 3) developed along the 460–505 K range,
which can be assigned to fusion steps of different regions of the
sample. Most of the previous reports describe a single asymmetric
signal in this range, probably due to the faster heating rates employed
therein (10–20 K min–1). However, it was
recently reported that textural effects and analysis conditions can
lead to more complex thermal signals.20 Beyond this, the sample 5.0L50% exhibits an intermediate behavior
with respect to the end members, suggesting the intimate mixture of
both kinds of PVA at a molecular level. The high degree of mixture
observed herein is in line with certain recent findings that demonstrate
the ability of the ice-templating method to drive the homogeneous
assembly of highly heterogeneous precursor systems.12

Figure 3 DSC trace for samples prepared with 5 m/v % PVA of 16 kD (5.0L100%)
and 90 kD (5.0L0%) average molecular weights and the binary mixture
(5.0L50%), recorded at 5 K min–1 under a N2 atmosphere.

Release properties of
PVA samples loaded with methyl orange probe
were recorded in water at 298 K; the amount of released probe was
quantified by means of UV–vis absorption at suitable time lapses.
The release behavior was parameterized on the basis of the Korsmeyer–Peppas21,22 model; cumulative release profiles were parameterized with the following
expression: 1  where Mt is the amount of drug permeated
at time t; M∞ is
the amount of drug at
infinite time; Mt/M∞ is the fraction of permeated drug (typically
obtained from Mt/M∞ values lower than 0.6); k is a kinetic constant; and n is a release exponent
that depends on the sample geometry and the hydration behavior. In
contrast with related systems, no lag time associated with the swelling
and plasticization of the polymeric matrix was observed.23−25 For samples prepared with total PVA contents equal to or higher
than 5 w/v %, the release profiles can be properly described, up to
a 70% cumulative release, employing an exponent of n = 0.50 ± 0.03 that stands compatible with an intermediate film/cylinder
geometry under the Fickian regime. The release profiles of samples
of increasing PVA mass fractions and their correspondent fitted curves
are presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Cumulative release (expressed in percentage) as a function of time
of samples 5.0L25% (empty triangles) and 7.5L25% (filled circles),
frozen at 8 mm min–1. The dotted lines represent
the optimized fittings based on the Korsmeyer–Peppas model.

Samples formulated with total
contents of PVA of 2.5 w/v % released
the probe on the scale of tens of minutes; the obtained release profiles
were noisy and difficult to fit, irrespective of the PVA nature. Then,
the approximate time required to reach a release of 50%, t50, was adopted as the release parameter to define the
behavior of this set of samples. A comprehensive screening of release
properties as a function of PVA formulation was performed on the basis
of t50 values. The behaviors of the samples
prepared with a given freezing rate, three total PVA contents (2.5,
5.0, and 7.5 w/v %), and increasing 16-to-90 kD ratios are summarized
in Figure 5. In general
terms, a net effect of both variables can be noticed; the release
kinetics for samples ranging from 5.0 to 7.5 w/v % is clearly affected
by the average molecular weight, decaying the t50 values to a half when 16 kD PVA is employed instead of 90
kD PVA. However, this tendency is not strictly proportional to the
average molecular weight and depends also on the total PVA content.
For total contents of PVA of 2.5 w/v %, the release is extremely fast,
with t50 values centered at 13 ±
4 min, irrespective of the PVA molecular weight. Along the explored
range of formulations, the release kinetics can be tuned in more than
an order of magnitude. Finally, a set of samples of 5.0 w/v % PVA
content were also prepared employing a faster freezing rate, revealing
that the effect of this variable on the release is not significant
(see Figure 5). The
marked similarity of PXRD patterns and water stability of monolithic
samples suggests a similar degree of polymer entanglement. Then, the
texture of macropores seems to be the main variable that limits the
probes release kinetics.

Figure 5 Dependence of t50 as a function of
PVA 16 kD mass fraction for PVA total content of 7.5% (●),
5.0% (▲), and 2.5% (■), frozen at 8 mm min–1. Samples of 5.0% content were also frozen at 5.5 mm min–1 (Δ).

Once established the
behavior of monolithic PVA carriers, an additional
set of samples was prepared with similar PVA formulations in the form
of small pellets (see Experimental Section for detailed procedure). This protocol allows an extremely fast
freezing rate or a limiting case that illustrates up to which extent
this variable can affect the final properties of PVA carriers. Once
frozen, representative samples were fractured before being submitted
to freeze-drying and finally inspected by FESEM; micrographs are depicted
in Figure 6. In general,
the porous structure remained notably disordered compared to those
of the monolithic counterparts, irrespective of the employed PVA.
Only the capsules of the 7.5L0% composition achieved a defined porosity,
aligned with the radial freezing gradient employed. Samples with a
PVA total content lower than 7.5 w/v % suffered a severe net contraction
with respect to the original drop diameter.

carriers (flash-frozen) of compositions 7.5L0%,
7.5L100%, 5L100, and 25L100. Scale bars represent 0.5 mm (left row),
100 μm (central row), and 2 μm (right row). The dashed
circumferences are an indicative reference of the parent drop diameter.

In contrast with the monolithic
carriers, pellets resulted in fast
release characterized by an almost constant t50 value of 15 ± 7 min (see Figure S4), independently of the PVA average molecular weight or the
total PVA content. However, despite this constancy, very different
behaviors were observed concerning the integrity of the PVA carriers
in aqueous media. In general, once a pellet is immersed in water,
the probe can be released through the diffusion of a stable swelled
(hydrated) PVA carrier (Scheme 1, upper path), as is the case of monolithic carriers. However,
if the PVA matrix is unstable, it can be disrupted into small fragments
through an erosion path that also drives release (Scheme 1, middle path). Eventually,
in the case of very unstable PVA carriers, massive dissolution prevails
(Scheme 1, lower path)
over the aforementioned paths.

Scheme 1 Release Mechanisms of PVA Carriers
Immersed in Water: Swelling Diffusion
(Upper Path), Disruption by Erosion (Middle Path), and Massive Dissolution
(Lower Path)
In the present case,
samples with a PVA content of 2.5 w/v % resulted
in massive disruption of the carrier; for the highest molecular weight,
a constant scattering signal evidenced the instantaneous presence
of undissolved PVA fragments in suspension, denoting a fast erosion-driven
mechanism (see Scheme 1). Samples rich in 16 kD PVA resulted in negligible scattering, indicating
the prevalence of dissolution. Samples with a total PVA content of
5.0 w/v % evidenced an increasing scattering signal along the experiment,
irrespective of the PVA nature, denoting a slower erosion mechanism
(see Figure S5). Finally, for all samples
prepared with a total PVA content of 7.5 w/v %, no significant scattering
was observed and the carriers remained stable toward erosion/dissolution,
indicating a strictly diffusive release of the probe from the swelled
carriers, as observed in the monolithic carriers. The behavior of
the evaluated pellets is summarized in Figure 7.

of total PVA content
and formulation.

Conclusions
The
controlled ice templating of aqueous solutions containing mixtures
of PVA and the subsequent freeze-drying can be adapted to the preparation
of molecular carriers with a range of dimensions and textures, ranging
from monolithic large pieces to millimetric pellets. If the carriers
are prepared from solutions composed of mixtures of PVA of different
molecular weights, intimate polymer mixtures result, resulting in
physical properties that stand in between those of the bare end members.

Monolithic carriers are stable in aqueous solution, and the probe
release is governed by a swelling–diffusion mechanism. The
kinetics of the probe release can be delayed from minutes to hours
with increasing total PVA content, the average PVA molecular weight,
or the relative composition, in the case of binary PVA mixtures. However,
the tendency is far from being easy to predict, and an extensive screening
is mandatory.

In the case of pellets (millimetric carriers),
the probe release
is restricted to the scale of minutes, irrespective of the PVA content
or composition. However, the content and nature of PVA dramatically
affect the stability of the polymeric matrix immersed in water. Depending
on the formulation, the carriers can develop swelling, erosion or
eventually massive dissolution.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Chemicals
Sample Preparation
Solutions of
PVA of 16 kD average
molecular weight (98% of hydrolysis) and/or 90 kD average molecular
weight (>99% of hydrolysis) were prepared in deionized water. The
total concentration of PVA was varied in the range 2.5–10%
by weight in volume; samples were denoted XLY% with X representing the total weight/volume
percentage of PVA in the parent solution and Y% representing
the mass percentage of low-molecular-weight PVA (16 kD) with respect
to the total polymer mass (PVA 16 kD + PVA 90 kD). All PVA samples
prepared for release determinations were also loaded with methyl orange
probe (0.25% weight in dry PVA weight basis).

Ice Structuration
Monoliths
Samples with controlled freezing rate and
oriented gradient were prepared by loading PVA solutions into the
molds, typically insulin syringes (length 80 mm and diameter 4 mm)
and subsequently directionally frozen by dipping the molds at defined
rates into a −196 °C (liquid nitrogen) cold bath. Because
the ice-front progress state reached a stationary value (e.g., nominal)
at the upper half of the sample, the characterization and experiments
were always conducted on that portion of the monolith.26

Pellets
Isotropically flash-frozen
spheroids were prepared
by dropping the aforementioned PVA solutions into the liquid nitrogen
cold bath. For each sample formulation, several pellets were prepared
for release experiments. A couple of pellets were fractured to exhibit
the inner structural features.

Both frozen pellets and monoliths
were submitted to lyophilization using an Alpha 1-2 LD Plus freeze-drier;
the resulting scaffolds were kept at room temperature in a desiccator
for further characterization.

Physical and Morphological
Characterization
The microstructures
of the obtained monolith scaffolds were observed by SEM (Zeiss SUPRA
40). Pore dimension and wall thickness of the monoliths were determined
from SEM micrographs of cross sections to the direction of freezing.
The crystallinity and thermal stability of representative bare PVA
samples prepared without the addition of methyl orange were explored.
PXRD was recorded measuring the samples from 5 to 60°, with a
0.02° step size and a 1 s step time. DSC (Shimadzu DSC 50) of
samples (3–5 mg) sealed in 40 μL Al crucible pans was
recorded from 25 to 300 °C at 5 °C min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Stability and Release Characterization
Release experiments
were carried out by the straight immersion of 10 mg of carrier in
10 mL of water under permanent stirring, preventing the straight contact
of the magnetic bar with the PVA matrix, to avoid mechanical disruption.
The cumulative release of the dye was determined by measuring the
absorbance of the liquid phase at 464 nm with recycling aliquots by
maintaining the volume constant throughout the experiment. For samples
that evidenced erosion and/or dissolution, the scattering signal of
PVA particles was deduced by subtracting the contribution of the molecular
spectrum of the released probe recorded from the total absorbance
signal.
