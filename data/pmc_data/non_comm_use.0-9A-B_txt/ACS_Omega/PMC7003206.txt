Efficient and highly stereoselective syntheses of (+)-proto-quercitol and (−)-gala-quercitol
starting
from the naturally abundant (−)-shikimic acid were described
in this article. (−)-Shikimic acid was first converted to the
key intermediate by eight steps in 53% yield. It was then converted
to (+)-proto-quercitol by three steps in 78% yield
and was also converted to (−)-gala-quercitol
by five steps in 63% yield. In summary, (+)-proto-quercitol and (−)-gala-quercitol were synthesized
from (−)-shikimic acid by 11 and 13 steps in 41 and 33% overall
yields, respectively.

==== Body
1 Introduction
(+)-proto-Quercitol 1 and (−)-gala-quercitol 2 (Figure 1) belong to the family of cyclohexanepentanols
named “quercitols” (a subclass of cyclitols).1 There are 16 stereoisomeric members in the family,
of which 12 optically active isomers are grouped into six pairs of
enantiomers and four other isomers are symmetric (or meso).2 (+)-proto-Quercitol 1 exists in nature; it can be isolated from many plant species.3 Several asymmetric syntheses of (+)-proto-quercitol 1 from (−)-quinic acid,4 (+)-inositol,5 and
some chiral intermediates6 have been reported.
(−)-gala-Quercitol 2 is non-natural.
It cannot be obtained from nature, but some asymmetric syntheses of
(−)-gala-quercitol 2 from (−)-quinic
acid4b,7 and other chiral starting materials8 have also been reported. To explore the potential
usage of (+)-proto-quercitol 1, (−)-gala-quercitol 2, and the derivatives in drug
discovery for controlling diabetes and related diseases,3b,3d,9 development of efficient and practical
asymmetric syntheses of these two target molecules is a promising
and challenging task in the pharmaceutical industry for chemists.

(−)-Shikimic acid (Figure 1) has captured worldwide attention10 in recent decades due to its use in the synthesis
of the
neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir-phosphate (Tamiflu, a drug for
the treatment of avian flu).11 Many researchers
have tried to improve production of (−)-shikimic acid via natural
extraction,10a microbial engineering,10e,10g and chemical synthesis.10a,12 (−)-Shikimic
acid is found in many plant species10a,10f,13 and is noted to be in particularly high abundance
in Chinese star anise (Illicium verum).10f,14 The Chinese star anise is a popular flavoring
material for foods in China, so it is annually planted in many areas
and is readily available in large quantities. (−)-Shikimic
acid has become a highly prospective molecule in the pharmaceutical
industry due to the development of new methods for rapid and high-yielding
extraction15 from Chinese star anise. We
have recently been engaged in developing novel syntheses of oseltamivir-phosphate11a,11b,11d,11f,11g and some other pharmaceutically
valuable molecules,16 and herein we want
to disclose highly diastereoselective, efficient, and practical syntheses
of (+)-proto-quercitol 1 and (−)-gala-quercitol 2 by using the commercially
available and inexpensive (−)-shikimic acid as the starting
material.

2 Results and Discussion
The novel total
synthesis of (+)-proto-quercitol 1 starting
from (−)-shikimic acid is depicted in Scheme 1. As can be seen
from Scheme 1, esterification
of (−)-shikimic acid first produced methyl (−)-shikimate 3 in 97% yield. Next, when compound 3 was exposed
to 2,2-dimethoxypropane (2,2-DMP) and catalytic p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) in ethyl acetate at room temperature
(rt), two cis vicinal hydroxyls were protected by
an acetonide moiety to give compound 4 in 95% yield.
Reaction of compound 4 with benzoyl chloride (BzCl),
triethylamine, and catalytic 4-diaminopyridine (DMAP) in dichloromethane
at 0 °C to room temperature furnished benzoate 5 in 96% yield. RuCl3-catalyzed stereoselective dihydroxylation17 of the α,β-unsaturated ester 5 in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, and water
(CH3CN/EtOAc/H2O = 3:3:1) at −5 °C
produced compound 6 in 88% yield. During the stereoselective
dihydroxylation of compound 5, ruthenium catalyst coordinated
with the double bond in the opposite direction of the acetonide moiety
due to its high steric hindrance, so that two hydroxyls at C-1 and
C-2 should have the desired upward orientation. Compound 6 was then exposed to tert-butyl-dimethylsilyl chloride
(TBDMSCl), triethylamine, and imidazole in dichloromethane under refluxing;
the less hindered secondary hydroxy at C-2 was selectively protected
by the TBDMS group to afford compound 7 in 92% yield.

Subsequently, when compound 7 was
treated with NaBH4 in a mixed solvent of dichloromethane
and methanol (CH2Cl2/CH3OH = 3:1)
at room temperature,
COOMe at C-1 could be selectively reduced due to the binding of the
α-hydroxy group with NaBH4,16a,18 and pinacol 8 was thus obtained in 89% yield. Oxidative
cleavage of the vicinal diols of compound 8 with NaIO4 in aqueous acetonitrile (CH3CN/H2O
= 10:1) at room temperature produced ketone 9 in 92%
yield. Compound 9 was then treated with NaBH4 at 0 °C in a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and water (EtOAc/H2O = 4:1); the carbonyl group was stereoselectively reduced
to furnish compound 10 in 90% yield, which was contaminated
with only a trace amount (<1%) of its epimer. Conformational analysis
for this highly stereoselective reduction is shown in Figure 2; compound 9 would
probably adapt to a boat conformation in which two bulky groups (OTBDMS
and OBz) at C-2 and C-5 are in equatorial positions, and then the
borohydride anion would attack the carbonyl group from the upward
direction to avoid repulsion between BH4– and the acetonide moiety. The silyl protective group (TBDMS) could
be removed by treatment of compound 10 with Bu4NF in tetrahydrofuran to produce compound 11 in 93%
yield. The acetonide moiety was then selectively removed by treatment
of compound 11 with hydrochloride acid (HCl) at room
temperature in a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and water (EtOAc/H2O = 10:1) to afford compound 12 in 92% yield,
and the ester group (OBz) kept intact during the reaction at room
temperature. Finally, compound 12 was exposed to ammonia
in methanol at room temperature to furnish (+)-proto-quercitol 1 in 91% yield.

Figure 2 Conformational analysis
for reduction of 9 to 10.

The novel total synthesis of (−)-gala-quercitol 2 starting from (−)-shikimic
acid is depicted in Scheme 2. As can be seen
from Scheme 2, compound 10 was first obtained from (−)-shikimic acid by the
same eight steps in 53% overall yield as per Scheme 1. Compound 10 was then exposed
to methanesulfonyl chloride (MsCl), triethylamine, and catalytic DMAP
in dichloromethane at 0 °C to produce methanesulfonate 13 in 95% yield. When compound 13 was treated
with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and acetic acid in toluene
under refluxing according to a previous report,19 an SN2-type substitution took place to furnish
compound 14 in 87% yield. An (S) configuration
of the chiral center at C-1 was inversed to an (R) configuration during this SN2-type substitution. For
the configuration inversion at C-1 of compound 10, we
have also tried the Mitsunobu reaction20 with various acids (PhCOOH, 4-NO2-PhCOOH, AcOH, and CF3COOH) as nucleophiles, but the yields were moderate. Subsequently,
the silyl protective group (TBDMS) was removed by treatment of compound 14 with Bu4NF in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature
to produce compound 15 in 92% yield. The acetonide moiety
was then removed by treatment of compound 15 with water
and trifluoracetic acid (CF3COOH) at room temperature to
produce compound 16 in 92% yield. Finally, compound 16 was exposed to ammonia at room temperature to afford (−)-gala-quercitol 2 in 90% yield.

of (−)-gala-Quercitol 2 Starting
from (−)-Shikimic Acid
In addition, the stereochemistries of compounds 10 and 14 have also been further confirmed by
the 2D NMR
technique. 1H–1H NOESY spectra of compounds 17 (the acetate of compound 10) and 14 are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen from the 1H–1H NOESY
spectrum of compound 14, there are NOE correction spots
between H-1 and H-5, meaning that protons on C-1 and C-5 have the
cis relationship, and thus the chiral center at C-1 of compound 14 has an (S) configuration. Moreover, as
can be seen from the 1H–1H NOESY spectrum
of compound 17, there are NOE correction spots between
H-1 and H-3, meaning that protons on C-1 and C-3 have the cis relationship,
and thus the chiral center at the C-1 position of compound 17 has an (R) configuration.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
performed stereoselective total syntheses
of (+)-proto-quercitol 1 and (−)-gala-quercitol 2 starting from the naturally
abundant (−)-shikimic acid. (+)-proto-Quercitol 1 has been synthesized starting from the naturally abundant
(−)-shikimic acid by 11 steps in 41% overall yield with >99%
purity; (−)-gala-quercitol 1 has
also been synthesized starting from (−)-shikimic acid by 13
steps in 33% overall yield with >99% purity. The above total syntheses
might be more practical than the other synthetic approaches described
in the literature4−8 due to some advantages such as high overall yields, good cost effectiveness,
as well as mild reaction conditions and simple experimental procedures
for all steps. In addition, the stereochemistries of compounds 14 and 17 (acetate of compound 10) have been unequivocally confirmed by analyses of their 1H–1H NOESY spectra.

1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AM-400 instrument;
chemical shifts are given on the δ scale as parts per million
(ppm) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Infrared
(IR) spectra were recorded with a Nicolet Magna IR-550 instrument.
Mass spectra were performed with an HP1100 LC-MS spectrometer. Melting
points were determined on a Mel-TEMP II apparatus. Column chromatography
was performed on silica gel (Qingdao Ocean Chemical Corp.). All chemicals
were analytically pure.

4.2 Methyl Shikimate 3
(−)-Shikimic
acid (20.00 g, 114.8 mmol) and anhydrous methanol (400 mL) were added
into a round-bottom flask, which was equipped with a stirrer bar.
After the mixture was stirred and cooled to 0 °C by an ice bath,
thionyl chloride (6.840 g, 57.50 mmol) was dropwise added into the
flask over 10 min. The ice bath was removed, and the mixture was then
heated and stirred under refluxing (60 °C) for 3 h. Charcoal
(3 g) was added, and the mixture was further stirred at 60 °C
for 1 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and then filtered
by suction to remove charcoal. The filtrate was concentrated under
vacuum to dryness to give the crude solid product. A mixed solvent
of ethyl acetate (150 mL) and hexane (100 mL) was added, and the mixture
was triturated and stirred for 2 h. The suspension was filtered to

4.17 (−)-gala-Quercitol 2
Compound 16 (502.5 mg, 1.620 mmol)
was dissolved in methanol (16 mL). Concentrated ammonia (4 mL) was
added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 h. After
the reaction was complete (checked by TLC, eluent: EtOAc/hexane =
2:1), charcoal (1.0 g) was added, and the mixture was further stirred
for 1 h. The mixture was filtered by suction, and the filtrate was
concentrated to dryness by vacuum distillation to give the crude solid
product. A mixed solvent of ether (20 mL) and pure water (15 mL) was
added and stirred for 5 min. The two phases were separated, and the
aqueous phase was washed twice with ether (2 × 15 mL). The aqueous
solution was concentrated to dryness by vacuum distillation. Toluene
(15 mL) was added and then removed by vacuum distillation. Toluene
(15 mL) was added again and then removed again by vacuum distillation.
Finally, (−)-gala-quercitol 2 (239.0 mg, 1.457 mmol) as off-white crystals was obtained in 90%
yield (>99% purity). Mp 253–255 °C {lit.7 249–256 °C}. [α]D25 = −52.8

Cyclohexane 17
Compound 10 (501.5
mg, 1.187 mmol), triethylamine (240.0 mg, 2.372 mmol), and DMAP (30.0
mg, 0.245 mmol) were dissolved in ethyl acetate (5 mL). The solution
was cooled to 0 °C by an ice bath. Acetic anhydride (158.0 mg,
1.548 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture was then stirred at
0 °C for 2 h. After the reaction was complete (checked by TLC,
eluent: EtOAc/hexane = 1:4), ethyl acetate (30 mL) and an aqueous
HCl solution (1 M, 5 mL) were added. The mixture was vigorously stirred
for 5 min, and then the two phases were separated by a separatory
funnel. The organic phase was washed successively with an aqueous
solution of potassium carbonate (10% w/w, 10 mL) and brine (5 mL).
After the organic solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, the solvent was removed by vacuum distillation to give the crude
product, which was then purified by flash chromatography (eluent:
EtOAc/hexane = 1:4) to afford compound 17 (529.0 mg,
