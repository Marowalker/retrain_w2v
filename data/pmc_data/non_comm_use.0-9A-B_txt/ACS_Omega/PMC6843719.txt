Deactivation
of catalysts due to rapid blocking of active surfaces
and pores is a major problem for methane cracking. The removal of
the template using different calcination methods contributes to the
different characteristics of catalyst support. Therefore, silica supports
were prepared with the sol–gel method, where sodium silicate
and chitosan are a silica source and a template, respectively. Calcination
using a microwave muffle furnace (MWF) was preferred over the conventional
electric muffle furnace at the heating rates of 2 and 17 °C/min
(CEF2 and CEF17, respectively) in order to remove the chitosan template.
A nickel nitrate precursor was loaded onto the obtained silica supports
by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The properties of the
silica support and the Ni/SiO2 catalysts were characterized
by means of N2-sorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray, field emission transmission
electron microscopy, and H2 temperature-programmed reduction.
The catalytic activity was evaluated using a fixed-bed reactor at
550 °C with a CH4/N2 ratio of 1:4 in the
feed. The amount and the allotropes of carbon deposited on the spent
catalysts were investigated using thermogravimetric/differential thermal
analysis. The results showed that the SiO2-MWF support
had a higher surface area and a larger pore volume of a mesoporous
structure with larger interparticle channels than that of the SiO2-CEF supports. This leads to the higher dispersion of Ni metal
particles over and inside the interparticle channels of the SiO2-MWF support. This provided a higher metal–support
interaction, resulting in lower rates of methane conversion and carbon
deposition on the catalyst surface than those of Ni/SiO2-CEF catalysts. However, it displayed a lower bed pressure. It was
found that the carbon fibers deposited on all the catalysts were multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Additionally, the base-growth mechanism
of MWCNTs was only exhibited by the Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Methane,
classified as one of the greenhouse gases, is the main
reason behind global warming, which is emitted into the atmosphere
through industrial processes and human activities. The utilization
of methane as a feedstock for producing value-added chemicals is hence
the most promising way to reduce its emission. Methane cracking is
an interesting reaction in the viewpoint of hydrogen production nowadays.1 Moreover, even carbon coproducts of this reaction
can be potentially used in industrial applications as composite materials,
catalysts, adsorbents, electrodes, and so forth. However, these may
play a role in the deactivation of catalysts, as they rapidly block
the active surface of metal catalysts.1,2 Coking is a
major concern regarding the catalyst deactivation for methane cracking
reaction. It results from the decomposition of adsorbed methane into
carbon and hydrogen over metal catalyst, covering the metal-active
size and blocking the pore of the catalyst. It leads to the loss of
catalytic activities.

Several investigations on methane cracking
over transition-metal
catalysts, such as Ni, Fe, Co, Pd, Mo, and so forth., have been reported
in many literature studies since the early 60s.3 It has been found that Ni-based catalysts showed significantly
higher catalytic activity and lower cost, which are favorable for
this reaction.4 García-Vargas et
al.5 reported that Ni particle size and
dispersion are key factors that affect the carbon deposition mechanism.
Highly dispersed tiny particles avoid carbon deposition, which could
cause irreversible catalyst deactivation and/or the increase of catalytic
bed pressure. Several researchers studied the effect of Ni catalyst
synthesis condition on Ni particle size and dispersion and related
it to methane cracking productivity and the life of a catalyst.2,6,7 In addition, many publications
have shown that the physicochemical properties of catalytic supports
could play an important role in influencing the catalytic performance
and deactivation of catalysts.1,8,9 For example, the effect of support materials for Ni-based catalyst
on the performance of methane cracking reaction has been examined
by Takenaka et al.10 and reported that
silica is one of the most effective supports for producing hydrogen
and carbon nanofibers among various supports.11

The pore characteristic of silica supports is also crucial
in influencing
the ability of catalysts, especially in methane cracking reaction
with carbon accumulated over the catalyst surface. A template is necessary
to create pores on the silica support. Chitosan is often used as a
template for synthesis of porous silica because it can easily be removed
through calcination and has reasonable commercial cost.12 The template removal condition by calcination
affects the pore characteristic of silica support. However, very limited
information is available on the impact of calcination for removing
the template of silica support on the catalytic performance and life
of catalysts, especially in the case of rapid deactivation of catalysts.
Recently, microwave irradiation has effectively been used for producing
ordered porous materials.13 It provides
a rapid and homogeneous heating of the entire sample, enhancing reaction
rates, facilitating the formation of uniform nucleation centers, and
is energy-efficient and environmental friendly.14

This study, therefore, aims to investigate the influence
of the
process of calcination for the removal of chitosan template on the
resulting Ni dispersion and characteristics of Ni/SiO2 catalysts
as well as their activity in catalyzing the methane cracking reaction.
In this work, silica support was prepared by sol–gel method
using sodium silicate as a silica source and chitosan as a template.
In order to remove the chitosan template, a microwave furnace was
used as a calcination technique compared to the conventional electric
furnace with different heating rates. It is hypothesized that different
calcination conditions for template removal of the SiO2 support affects the life and catalyst performance of the SiO2-supported Ni catalyst.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Textural Properties and
Elemental Analysis
The textural properties of silica support
and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, namely, specific surface area, pore
diameter, and pore
volume, were studied with N2 isothermal adsorption–desorption
(Table 1). Chitosan
template removal using a microwave muffle furnace (MWF) not only produces
higher surface area silica support but also produces larger total
pore volume compared to those of silica supports obtained from the
template removal using electric muffle furnace, because chitosan has
high dielectric constant and dielectric loss (80 and 120 at 25 °C,
respectively),15 which makes it transparent
to microwave. The absorbed energy is then converted into heat, causing
rapid temperature increase and hence the accelerated decomposition
of chitosan within the silica support.16 Therefore, the shrinkage of the silica support in the case of calcination
using a MWF was lower than that in the cases of calcinations using
a conventional electric muffle furnace. Tian et al.17 suggested that the usage of microwaves in order to remove
the template of siliceous porous materials had many advantages, namely,
it provides very fast and complete removal of the template while providing
very low structure shrinkage. It has been found that the specific
surface areas and pore volumes of all supports are drastically decreased
after the loading of nickel metal precursor. These results indicated
that the pore of the silica support samples was partially blocked
by NiO particles.1 The N2-sorption
results shown in Figure 1a reveal that the isotherms of all silica products exhibited the
composite isotherm between types IV and II with categorized in H3
hysteresis loops at high relative pressure, indicating the existence
of mesoporous structures. The results implied that the usage of either
a microwave or a conventional electric muffle furnace to remove chitosan
template could produce mesoporous silica supports, which attributed
to the slit-type pores associated with interparticle porosity generated
in solids with platelike morphology.9,18Figure 1b shows pore size distribution
for all removed chitosan template supports. It is apparent that SiO2-MWF exhibits more uniform pore size of mesoporous than SiO2-CEF2 and SiO2-CEF17 supports. The N2-sorption isotherm and pore size distribution of loaded Ni on all
supports are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively, revealing the same characteristics for
all supports with lower volumes of N2-sorption compared
to unloading support (Figure 1), which causes their pore volume to reduce because of partial
blocking by NiO particles.

The influences of calcination technique
on the morphologies and
porous structures of the NiO/SiO2 catalysts were characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 3 shows the SEM image of NiO/SiO2-CEF2, NiO/SiO2-CEF17, and NiO/SiO2-MWF samples.
It is clearly observed that the SiO2-MWF support exhibited
a highly porous and spongelike structure with large pore size and
interparticle channels. On the other hand, the SiO2-CEF2
and SiO2-CEF17 support exhibited dense aggregates of smaller-sized
particles and interparticle channels. The mesopores of silica support
were formed as the result of primary silica nanoparticle aggregation
produced by hydrolysis–condensation of sodium silicate,19 while the formation of the interparticle channels
between mesoporous silica particles was caused by template removal
during the calcination process.20 Calcination
permits the removal of organic compounds presented in the structure
of chitosan, which can be involved in the formation of both hydrogen
and intermolecular bonding with silica. When calcination takes place
at 600 °C for those compounds decomposed, the intermolecular
force and hydrogen bonding were eliminated, resulting in the enlargement
of voids in the chitosan network.21,22 With the use
of microwave calcination furnace, the largest interparticle channels
of silica are generated as compared to the electric furnace. This
is due to the higher calcination rate obtained from the microwave
furnace. Still, SiO2-CEF17 was provided by the removal
of the chitosan template by applying an equivalent heating rate to
the microwave furnace (17 °C/min), but smaller channels and more
dense structures were obtained. These results are obtained because
of the occurrence of shrinkage.23 In addition,
the textural properties were successfully improved by microwave technique
as reflected by the large surface areas, high total pore volume, and
large primary pore sizes. These results corresponded to N2 sorption results (Table 1). Therefore, it is concluded that microwave calcination can
contribute to the performance of the porous structure with high surface
area.

NiO/SiO2-CEF17, and (e,f) NiO/SiO2-MWF catalysts.

The crystallographic structures and types of metal
oxide species
of the calcined catalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).
As shown in Figure 4a, the strong broad peaks in the range of 2θ = 15–25°
can be assigned to amorphous silica.24 It
is clearly observed that all catalysts show similar diffraction peaks
at 2θ of 37.35, 43.35, 63, and 75.5 corresponding to the (111),
(200), (220), and (311) planes for a typical cubic phase of NiO.1,2 The NiO crystallite sizes estimated from the full width at half-maximum
of the (200) plane according to Scherrer’s equation are listed
in Table 1. It is noticeable
that the average particle sizes of NiO deposited over all SiO2 supports are larger than their silica pore diameter. It is
indicated that most of the NiO particles were deposited on the external
surface of their silica supports.25 However,
the NiO crystallite size over SiO2-MWF support showed the
smallest size among the NiO over SiO2-CEF2 and SiO2-CEF17 supports. Therefore, the NiO particles had a greater
opportunity to be positioned in the pores and interparticle channels
of the supports in the case of SiO2-MWF supports compared
to those over other SiO2 supports.

Figure 4 XRD pattern of NiO (left)
and Ni metal (right) on (a) SiO2-CEF2, (b) SiO2-CEF17, and (c) SiO2-MWF support.

Figure 4b depicts
the wide-angle XRD patterns of the Ni catalysts obtained by the reduction
of NiO under hydrogen atmosphere at 700 °C, which found that
all catalysts exhibited similar diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44.5,
51.8, and 76.4, corresponding to (111), (200), and (220) planes of
metallic Ni with the absence of NiO peaks observed.26 This suggests that during the reduction of the catalysts,
Ni2+ of NiO can be completely reduced to the active form
of Ni0.27 Besides, the Ni crystalline
size, as listed in Table 1, can also be calculated by Scherrer’s equation from
the (111) plane. As can be clearly seen, SiO2-MWF is the
smallest crystalline size of 13.30 nm. On the other hand, SiO2-CEF17 is the largest crystallite size of 14.50 nm, which
may be due to the aggregation of Ni particles during the reduction
process.28

The metal to support the
interaction of catalyst plays an important
role in controlling the accessibility of active species to reactant
and the agglomeration tendency of active metals that have a substantial
influence on catalytic performance.29 The
reducibility of NiO over SiO2-CEF2, SiO2-CEF17,
and SiO2-MWF is determined by the H2 temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) profiles, as shown in Figure 5. It can be observed that a similar reduction
process occurred. The appearance of reduction peaks for NiO/SiO2-CEF2 at 330 and 430 °C and NiO/SiO2-CEF17
and NiO/SiO2-MWF at 420 and 450 °C, respectively,
are assigned to the reduction of bulk NiO in the outermost surface,
having less interaction with the supports. In contrast, the peak at
higher temperatures of 550, 550, and 630 °C is assigned to the
reduction of NiO in the subsurface, having strong interaction with
the SiO2 supports. It is confirmed that NiO over all SiO2 supports was completely reduced at temperatures not exceeding
700 °C, consistent with the XRD results of Ni/SiO2 in the absence of NiO pattern. In addition, it could be clearly
observed that NiO over SiO2-MWF was reduced at the highest
reduction temperature.2,29 Considering the isolation effect
reported by Hu30 there are two possible
types of NiO species in the NiO/SiO2 catalysts: (1) NiO
surrounded by SiO2 and (2) NiO surrounded by NiO. The first
type of NiO has lower reducibility than the second type of NiO because
the first type of NiO was isolated by SiO2, hindering the
formation of a Ni–Ni bond while removing the O atom by hydrogen.
Therefore, the results indicate that microwave calcination enhanced
the incorporation between the NiO and SiO2 in the NiO/SiO2 catalyst, resulting in more NiO surrounded by SiO2 and requiring a higher H2 reduction temperature.31

Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM)
images
of the reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts (Figure 6) also show Ni particle sizes ranging from
ca. 5.88 to 47.06 nm for Ni/SiO2-MWF, which are smaller
than Ni particles over SiO2-CEF2 and SiO2-CEF17,
supporting the XRD results.

The metal dispersion of Ni over each SiO2 support was
roughly observed using energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), as shown in Figure 3b,d,f. Still, these
catalysts have similar actual amount of nickel, approximately 10%
wt as listed in Table 2. The lowest amount of Ni particles dispersed on the SiO2-MWF support. This might be due to its large pore diameter and interparticle
channels; smaller-sized Ni particles could easily penetrate into the
pores and deposit in higher amounts. This is consistent with the N2-sorption results (Table 1), which can observe the highest decreasing pore volume
of SiO2-MWF support after Ni loading from 0.7 to 0.54 cm3/g (accounted for 22.86%). In addition, the highest Ni dispersion
and the smallest Ni particle size are observed only on the SiO2-MWF support compared with the SiO2-CEF2 and SiO2-CEF17 supports. The dispersion of Ni metal over SiO2 support could also be confirmed by the FE-TEM image, as shown in Figure 6. It exhibited high
Ni metal dispersion in the case of Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst.
This confirmed that the SiO2-MWF support might contribute
to the dispersion of Ni metals both on the surface and in the pores/interparticle
channels of support.

2.2 External and Internal Diffusion Elimination
To investigate the influence of calcination process on the activity
and stability of Ni/SiO2 catalysts in methane cracking
reaction by neglecting the effect of mass transfer, the external and
internal diffusion elimination was considered. The elimination of
external diffusion was conducted by changing the space velocity of
the reactant gases. The space velocity was varied by changing the
total flow rate of the reactant gases, while maintaining a constant
weight of the catalyst. The total flow rate of the reactant gases
was varied by 80, 100, and 120 mL/min and 0.1 g of catalysts with
53–106 μm were employed. Therefore, the investigated
gas hourly space velocities (GHSVs) were 48 000, 60 000,
and 72 000 mL/g·h, respectively. The elimination of internal
diffusion was practiced by changing the particle size of catalysts,
while maintaining a constant GHSV of the reactant gases. The particle
size of Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalyst was varied by <53, 53–106,
and 106–149 μm. The GHSV of the reactant gases was maintained
at 60 000 mL/g·h. Therefore, 0.1 g of catalysts and the
total flow rate of the reactant gases of 100 mL/min were employed.
The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 550 °C under
atmospheric pressure for 60 min of reaction time. Figures S1 and S2 show that the GHSV in the range of 48 000–72 000
mL/g·h and the particle size of catalysts in the range of <53–149
μm have no obvious effects on methane conversion and hydrogen
yield in methane cracking reaction. It confirmed that the use of 60 000
mL/g·h GHSV of reactant gases and catalysts with 53–106
μm particle size, used in this study to monitor the performance
of Ni/SiO2 catalysts in methane cracking reaction, could
eliminate the effect of external and internal diffusions.

2.3 Performance Evaluation of Ni/SiO2 Catalyst in Methane
Cracking Reaction
The activities of
the prepared Ni/SiO2 catalysts for methane cracking reaction
were investigated by testing in a catalytic fixed-bed reactor at 550
°C throughout 360 min of time on stream. On the basis of the
lower limits of gas chromatography analysis (ppm), only hydrogen was
obtained as a gaseous product over all catalysts, without other hydrocarbon
products being detected. Figure 7a shows that the methane conversions of Ni/SiO2-CEF2 and Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalysts were higher than
that of Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst in the initial period of reaction,
indicating that they are more favorable in the methane cracking reaction
than Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst in the first period of reaction.
This result was due to most Ni particles dispersed on the surface
of SiO2-CEF2 and SiO2-CEF17 support, as presented
in the EDX results (Figure 3). It indicated more active sites, which can easily react
with methane, leading to a faster reaction rate in an initial period
of reaction. However, the methane cracking reactions over Ni/SiO2-CEF2 and Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalysts were unable to
continue until 360 min of time on stream because a serious pressure
drop followed by plugging of the reactor was observed. There was high
pressure inside the packed bed tube reactor, gradually increasing
to a severe pressure drop of 10 bars, as depicted in Figure 7c. This was caused by the formation
of carbon fibers deposited over the catalysts’ surface. A TG
analysis confirmed that the increase in pressure drop was caused by
the carbon deposition on the catalyst bed.7,32 This
is discussed further in Section 2.4. Therefore, for safety reasons, catalyst activity
testing was stopped when the pressure drop reached 10 bars, even though
they had not completely deactivated. In contrast, Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst contains a smaller amount of Ni-active sites over its
surface, owing to the deposition of Ni particles inside the SiO2-MWF support, as discussed above. This leads to lower methane
conversion than Ni/SiO2-CEF2 and Ni/SiO2-CEF17
catalysts. It is clearly noticeable that the methane cracking reaction
over Ni/SiO2-MWF could be carried out with a gradual decrease
of methane conversion and hydrogen yield until the end of time for
testing throughout 360 min.

Figure 7 (a) Methane conversion and (b) hydrogen yield
in methane cracking
reaction over Ni/SiO2 catalysts and (c) profile of pressure
occurs in packed bed reactor during catalytic testing.

Considering the hydrogen yields of all catalysts shown in Figure 7b, it has been found
that they are in the same trend of increasing over 20 min. The hydrogen
yields of Ni/SiO2-CEF2, Ni/SiO2-CEF17, and Ni/SiO2-MWF catalysts were increased to maximum values of 33.73,
30.08, and 33.63%, respectively. After that, the hydrogen yields of
all catalysts are in the same trend as gradually decreasing. It is
remarkable to notice that Ni/SiO2-CEF catalysts have higher
methane conversion; on the other hand, Ni/SiO2-CEF2 catalyst
has the same hydrogen yield while Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalyst
has lower hydrogen yield compared to Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst.
It is due to the fact that Ni/SiO2-CEF catalysts have higher
reactivity that generates more carbon fibers. Thus, hydrogen product
might be adsorbed inside carbon fibers. The effect of the carbon product
formed on the spent Ni/SiO2-CEF17 and Ni/SiO2-MWF catalysts, on the H2 adsorption performance at 550
°C of reaction temperature, was investigated. It has been found
that the carbon formed on the spent Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalyst
can adsorb higher amounts of H2 gas (∼12.09% of
H2 adsorption) as compared to the carbon formed on the
spent Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst (∼10.32% of H2 adsorption). This result could be explained by the H2 product being adsorbed on carbon products (carbon fibers or carbon
nanotubes), resulting in lower hydrogen detection, which was in agreement
with the results reported by Kahle et al.33

2.4 Post-Reaction Study of the Spent Ni/SiO2 Catalysts
All spent catalysts were investigated
in order to determine the amount and allotropes of carbon products.
The simultaneous TG/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) technique
was applied and the results are shown in Figure 8. It is clearly seen that the derivative
weight loss peaks for the carbon deposited on each catalyst appeared
at a temperature range of 562–706.1, 602.1–710.8, and
553.3–670 °C for Ni/SiO2-MWF, Ni/SiO2-CEF2, and Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalysts, respectively. It was
observed that all catalysts were oxidized at high temperature (above
550 °C), indicating the presence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs) on all of the catalysts.1,34 This conclusion
is obtained because of the fact that MWCNTs are thermally stable up
to 420 °C under air atmosphere with no phase change or any oxidation
reaction taking place.35 The oxidation
of raw MWCNTs started at 420 °C and finished at 630 °C,
while the oxidation of graphitized MWCNTs took place between 640 and
780 °C.35 It can be observed that
highly graphitized MWCNTs occurred over Ni/SiO2-MWF and
Ni/SiO2-CEF2 catalysts.

Figure 8 TG/DTA curve of spent (a) Ni/SiO2-CEF2, (b) Ni/SiO2-CEF17, and (c) Ni/SiO2-MWF
catalyst after being
used in methane cracking reaction.

The efficiency of catalysts to grow carbon nanotubes can be reflected
by the weight loss of the carbon deposits.1 The amount of MWCNTs performed over Ni/SiO2-CEF2, Ni/SiO2-CEF17, and Ni/SiO2-MWF catalysts (Table 2) yielded 67.92, 62.84, and
71.77%, respectively. It was found that Ni/SiO2-MWF yielded
the highest amount of MWCNTs among both Ni/SiO2-CEF catalysts
because it is the longest usable catalyst. However, Ni/SiO2-CEF2 and Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalysts are used in shorter
periods of 120 and 80 min of time on stream, respectively, but MWCNT
amounts formed on these catalysts are almost equal to that on Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst used in a period of 360 min. This result indicates
that Ni/SiO2-CEF2 and Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalysts
can convert more methane into MWCNTs in a comparative period. In addition,
the rate of carbon formation can be considered as the relative carbon
yield per reaction time listed in Table 2. It was found that the fastest carbon deposition
rate of Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalyst was observed. It showed
that higher Ni aggregated over catalyst surface can accelerate the
rate of carbon deposition on the catalysts.36 This was consistent with the results of reactivity results, Ni/SiO2-CEF17 showed fastest rate of methane conversion yielding
fastest rate of carbon deposition.

Gohier et al.37 discussed that particle
size was not the only condition which controls the growth mechanism
of carbon nanotubes but is one of the conditions for choosing tip
or base growth. In addition, the metal–support interactions
were also found to play a crucial role in the growth mechanism. The
strong metal–support interaction yielded a base-growth mechanism,
whereas the weak metal–support interaction leads to the formation
of a tip-growth mechanism.1,34 This is consistent
with the results of this work, which found that the smallest NiO size
had the strongest interaction with SiO2-MWF support and
generated base-growth MWCNTs, as shown in Figure 9c. On the other hand, Ni/SiO2-CEF2
and Ni/SiO2-CEF17, which are larger amounts of larger Ni
particle sizes dispersed on the support surface and weaker interaction
between the metal and support, generated tip-growth MWCNTs. This evidence
is consistent with the activity results confirming that Ni/SiO2-MWF has a lower methane conversion than Ni/SiO2-CEF2 and Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalysts in the initial period
because Ni particles are more deposited inside the pore and interparticle
channels. Ni particles, located inside the pores, had strong interactions
with the SiO2 support. This led to carbon covering on Ni
particles and the carbon nanofibers to grow through base-growth mechanism.
Additionally, it was difficult to grow CNTs inside the hollow of a
pore because the blockage of Ni particles by graphite prevents them
from growing outward.38 Therefore, the
strong interaction between Ni and support, related to mainly base-growth
MWCNT generation, can be observed in the case of Ni/SiO2-MWF, and the good dispersion of Ni over the support with low shrinkage
of silica support can prolong the life of Ni/SiO2 to longer
than 360 min. In addition, the Ni/SiO2-MWF provided the
longer life more than 40% with higher hydrogen yield compared to Ni/SiO2 catalysts for methane cracking reaction reported by Tanggarnjanavalukul
et al.2 and Donphai et al.7

Figure 9 FE-TEM images of MWCNTs generated on spent (a) Ni/SiO2-CEF2, (b) Ni/SiO2-CEF17, and (c) Ni/SiO2-MWF
catalysts after being used in methane cracking reaction.

The SEM image of MWCNTs deposited over Ni/SiO2-CEF2,
Ni/SiO2-CEF17, and Ni/SiO2-MWF catalysts is
shown in Figure 10. It is clearly observed that highest dense MWCNT fibers were generated
over Ni/SiO2-CEF17 catalyst, followed by Ni/SiO2-CEF2 and Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst, respectively. This result
may be obtained because the Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst had a
large cavity obtained from the interparticle channels. In addition,
the largest average size of MWCNTs over Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst
was obtained as a result of the longest usable catalyst.

The performances of the catalysts in this work were compared to
those of previously reported ones, as listed in Table 3. The study of the relative high nickel loading
and the effect of promoter addition produced higher methane conversion
and hydrogen yield as reported by Zhang and Amiridis39 Zhu et al.,40 Bayat et al.,41 and Pudukudy et al.42 This indicates that the relative high nickel loadings and operating
temperature are favorable for the methane cracking process.7 In the case of low nickel loading (ca. 10% Ni)
without any promoters and mild operating condition reported in this
work and previously by Tanggarnjanavalukul et al.2 and Donphai et al.,7 it was
found that the effect of catalyst support could facilitate the dispersion
of nickel, also facilitating high catalytic activity.

The influence
of calcination technique on the SiO2 support
characteristics is focused. This directly affects Ni/SiO2 catalysts activity in methane cracking and the formation of carbon
nanofibers. Obviously, the calcination by MWF generates larger interparticle
channels of SiO2 support with higher amount of Ni metal
particle deposited inside. The result is that the catalytic activity
in methane cracking of Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst is lower than
those of Ni/SiO2-CEF catalysts. This is because Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst presents a lower amount of Ni active site over
SiO2 surface, even though the dispersion of the smaller
size of Ni active site over SiO2 support surface is higher
as compared to Ni/SiO2-CEF catalysts. The Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst exhibited a higher metal–support interaction
resulting in lower rate of carbon production than that of Ni/SiO2-CEF catalyst. On the other hand, the problem of excessive
bed pressure inside the reactor seems not to be occurred in the cases
of the usage of Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst, which shows an advantage
of the calcination by MWF. In addition, according to the highest metal–support
interaction of Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst, the base-growth mechanism
of MWCNTs is only generated over its surface, different from those
of Ni/SiO2-CEF catalysts that the tip-growth mechanism
is obtained.

3 Conclusions
The
removal of chitosan template of silica support by calcination
using a MWF directly affected the textural properties, reducibility,
and catalytic performance in the methane cracking reactions of Ni/SiO2 catalyst. It was found that chitosan template removal by
using a MWF (SiO2-MWF) was not only the technique providing
the fastest template decomposition but also yielded high surface area
and larger pore volume of mesoporous structure with larger interparticle
channels, significantly facilitating the dispersion of Ni particles
on the support surface of Ni/SiO2-MWF catalyst. In contrast,
Ni/SiO2-CEF2 and Ni/SiO2-CEF17 showed higher
catalytic reactivity for the methane cracking reaction in an initial
period, even though their high activity leads to the problem of excess
bed pressure in the reactor during usage. It can be concluded that
different techniques of calcination for template removal significantly
affect different textural properties and catalyst characteristics
as well as reactivity in the methane cracking reaction, resulting
in the different characteristics of carbon nanotubes formed over the
spent catalysts.

4 Experiment
4.1 Chemicals
Chitosan with 90% deacetylation
was purchased from Eland Corporation (Nonthaburi, Thailand). Sodium
silicate (Na2Si3O7: 30 wt % SiO2, 4 wt % NaOH) was obtained from Thai Silicate Chemicals (Bangkok,
Thailand). Perfume hydrochloric acid (37%) and glacial acetic acid
were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Nickel(II) nitrate
hexahydrate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All
chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used without any
further purification.

4.2 Silica Support Preparation
Silica
supports were prepared using the sol–gel method. In the first
step, 0.4 g of chitosan was dissolved in 100 mL of 2% (v/v) acetic
acid under continuous stirring at 300 rpm for 30 min while temperature
was controlled at 40 °C in a water bath. Then, 5.4 g of sodium
silicate solution (based on 1.0 g of SiO2) was primarily
diluted with 10 mL of deionized water and added to the chitosan solution.
The mixture was quickly adjusted to pH 6 by addition of 2.0 M HCl
solution. The mixture was left under hydrolysis–condensation
reaction for 3 h with continuous stirring and temperature controlled
at 40 °C. Next, the resultant mixture was aged in a Teflon-lined
autoclave at 100 °C for 24 h. The precipitated products were
filtered, washed several times with distilled water, and dried using
a microwave oven (LG, MS2343DAR, Seoul, Korea) at 600 W for 40 min.
Finally, a MWF (CEM, Phoenix, Matthews, NC) and a conventional electric
muffle furnace (Nabertherm, HT 16/16, Lilienthal, Germany) were employed
to calcine at 550 °C for 4 h with varying heating rates in order
to remove chitosan template. Abbreviations for the different techniques
were designated as follows:MWF denotes calcination using a MWF

CEF2 denotes calcination using a conventional electric
muffle furnace with a heating rate of 2 °C/min

CEF17 denotes calcination using a conventional electric
muffle furnace with a heating rate of 17 °C/min (equivalent to
the heating rate of a MWF)



4.3 Loading of Nickel Metal onto Silica Supports
In this
study, 10.0 wt % nickel on silica supports was prepared
by the incipient wetness impregnation method. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate
(0.25 g) [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O] used
as nickel precursor was dissolved in 1.3 mL of deionized water and
added dropwise into 0.4 g of the prepared silica support. After that,
the mixture was dried using a microwave oven (LG, MS2343DAR, Seoul,
Korea) at 800 W for 1 min and then calcined using an electric muffle
furnace in air at 550 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.2 The catalysts were then ground and sieved to
collect the catalyst particles of 53–106 μm (140–270
meshes).

4.4 Catalyst Characterization
The textural
properties, namely, specific surface area and pore size distribution
of silica supports, both before and after nickel metal loading, were
characterized by N2-sorption using a gas physisorption
analyzer (Quantachrome, Autosorb-1C, Boynton Beach, FL) at −196
°C. Samples were degassed at 200 °C for 4 h prior to measurement.
The surface area and total volume were determined according to the
standard Brunauere–Emmette–Teller (BET) method and the
amount of adsorbed N2, respectively. The pore diameter
distributions were calculated based on desorption isotherms by the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The crystallographic
structures of catalysts were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker
AXS GmbH, D8 Discover, Karlsruhe, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation
at a small angle in the 2θ range of 0–10 and a wide angle
in the 2θ range of 10–80, respectively. Average crystallite
size was obtained using the global Scherrer’s equation.

The morphology of catalysts was observed by using a scanning electron
microscope (FEI, Quanta 450, Hillsboro, OR) equipped with EDX analysis
at an accelerating voltage of 10 keV. The samples were coated with
a gold layer prior to analysis.

Transmission electron microscopy
images were obtained using FE-TEM
(JEOL, JEM-3100F, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 300
kV. Prior to analysis, the samples were dispersed in ethanol and sonicated
for 30 min. The suspension was dropped onto a copper grid coated with
a carbon film and dried at room temperature.

The actual amounts
of nickel in Ni/SiO2 catalysts were
determined by using inductively coupled plasma–optical emission
spectrometry (ICP–OES, Optima 8300, PerkinElmer, Singapore).
Prior to analysis by ICP–OES, all of the catalyst samples were
digested in 10% v/v of HNO3 by using microwave digestion
(Titan MPS, PerkinElmer, Germany).

TPR measurement was performed
to identify the reduction temperature
and interaction between nickel metal and each support in the temperature
range of 50–900 °C using a continuous-flow tube reactor
(Inconel-600, o.d. 3/8″) and a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
The mixture of H2 and Ar (9.6% H2 balanced with
Ar) was fed into the catalyst bed and H2 consumption was
monitored using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014, Kyoto, Japan)
equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Types of carbon
on catalysts were examined by using a simultaneous DTA–TGA
analyzer (NETZSCH-Gerätebau GmbH, STA 449F3, Selb, Germany)
in air at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000 °C.

4.5 Performance of Methane Cracking Reaction
In order to examine the performance of Ni catalysts over different
support structures, 0.1 g of each Ni/SiO2 catalyst was
packed in a tube reactor (Inconel-600, o.d. 3/8″). Prior to
each experiment being conducted, the catalyst was reduced in H2 atmosphere (99.99% purity) at a flow rate of 60 mL/min and
a temperature of 700 °C (obtained from TPR results) for 2 h.
After that, the reactant gases (CH4 diluted with N2 at a volume ratio of 1:4) were introduced into the reactor
at a total flow rate of 100 mL/min (the GHSV of 60 000 mL/g·h)
and operating temperatures of 550 °C under atmospheric pressure.
The obtained gaseous products were analyzed using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph
(GC-2014) equipped with a TCD for H2, CO, and CO2, while CH4 analysis was done using a Unibead-C packed
column. The percentage of methane conversion and hydrogen yield can
be defined as follows43 1   2  

4.6 H2 Adsorption
Experiment
The H2 chemisorption technique was
used in order to prove
that the H2 adsorbed on the carbon formed on the Ni/SiO2 catalysts, after CH4 cracking reaction at 550
°C. First, the spent Ni/SiO2 catalysts were pretreated
under Ar flow at 550 °C for 1 h, in order to remove the moisture
and clean the surface of the catalyst. Then, H2 gas was
pulse-dosed into the reactor. The amount of H2 adsorbed
was monitored using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014, Kyoto,
Japan) equipped with a TCD.
