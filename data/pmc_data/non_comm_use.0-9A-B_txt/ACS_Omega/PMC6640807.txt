Catalytic
hydrogenation is an important process used for the production
of everything from foods to fuels. Current heterogeneous implementations
of this process utilize metals as the active species. Until recently,
catalytic heterogeneous hydrogenation over a metal-free solid was
unknown; implementation of such a system would eliminate the health,
environmental, and economic concerns associated with metal-based catalysts.
Here, we report
good hydrogenation rates and yields for a metal-free heterogeneous
hydrogenation catalyst as well as its unique hydrogenation mechanism.
Catalytic hydrogenation of olefins was achieved over defect-laden h-BN (dh-BN) in a reactor designed to maximize
the defects in h-BN sheets. Good yields (>90%)
and
turnover frequencies (6 × 10–5–4 ×
10–3) were obtained for the hydrogenation of propene,
cyclohexene, 1,1-diphenylethene, (E)- and (Z)-1,2-diphenylethene, octadecene, and benzylideneacetophenone.
Temperature-programmed desorption of ethene over processed h-BN indicates the formation of a highly defective structure.
Solid-state NMR (SSNMR) measurements of dh-BN with
high and low propene surface coverages show four different binding
modes. The introduction of defects into h-BN creates
regions of electronic deficiency and excess. Density functional theory
calculations show that both the alkene and hydrogen-bond order are
reduced over four specific defects: boron substitution for nitrogen
(BN), vacancies (VB and VN), and
Stone–Wales defects. SSNMR and binding-energy calculations
show that VN are most likely the catalytically active sites.
This work shows that catalytic sites can be introduced into a material
previously thought to be catalytically inactive through the production
of defects.

Introduction
Originally discovered
in 1897 by Sabatier, who received a Nobel
prize for this work in 1912, catalytic hydrogenation is widely used
in industry and is heavily utilized in the synthesis of many pharmaceutical
and agricultural chemicals.1 Although the
conversion of olefins to alkanes is thermodynamically favored under
appropriate conditions, such reactions are so sluggish that a catalyst
is required to facilitate hydrogenation. It was first observed that
traces of nickel could mediate the addition of H2 to olefins2 and later that palladium, platinum, rhodium,
and other precious metals exhibited similar catalytic activities,
owing to the overlap between the metal d-orbitals and hydrogen molecular
orbitals.

Two disadvantages of the use of these metals are their
cost and
leaching of the metals into the product. Utilizing nickel-based catalysts,
particularly in the hydrogenation of fats, has largely circumvented
the problem of cost. However, nickel
is readily poisoned by sulfur-containing compounds when natural fats
or decomposition products introduce sulfides into the catalytic system.3 In addition, unacceptable levels of nickel can
leach into the final product, with nickel levels of 0.1–1.5
ppm known to be present in hydrogenated oils.4−6 These and other
factors have stimulated research efforts to develop benign, nonmetallic
hydrogenation catalysts.

Homogeneous nonmetallic catalysis has
been developed for a wide
range of reactions.7 However, metal-free
hydrogenations using molecular hydrogen were not realized until 2006,
when Stephan and co-workers developed the first non-transition-metal
system capable of releasing and absorbing molecular hydrogen.8 Soon after, the term “frustrated Lewis
pair” or FLP was coined to describe these systems.9 An explosion of research activity followed.10−12 The key feature of an FLP-catalyzed reaction is the formation of
a Lewis acid and base that cannot form a conventional adduct, from
either steric or electronic frustration. Early work showed that these
FLPs could bind olefins and alkynes.9,13 Through their
interaction with hydrogen and other molecules, FLPs have been shown
to successfully catalyze the hydrogenation of imines, enamines, aldehydes,2,14,15 olefins,16 and alkynes to alkenes.17 More recently,
carbon dioxide has been reduced over a solid indium oxide-based FLP.18

Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation,
which is preferred for large-scale
industrial processes due to the ease of catalyst separation and applicability
to continuous flow reactions,19 has only
recently been reported for metal-free systems with low conversion
rates.20 On the basis of our experience
with mechanochemical processes and the fact that defects in h-BN (dh-BN) have been shown to reduce
the hydrogen-bond order,19 we investigated
the hydrogenation of a series of olefins over dh-BN.
Defects were introduced into h-BN and mobilized by
conducting hydrogenation reactions using a reactor based on a ball
mill (Figure S2). To our delight, hydrogenation
of a variety of substrates was successful under milder conditions
than those used for nickel catalysts. With very low catalyst loadings
(Figures 1 and S1) we achieved better olefin hydrogenation
turnover frequencies TOFs than those for the best FLP catalysts.

Figure 1 Hydrogenation
of (E)-1,2-diphenylethene [6] under
excess hydrogen at 170 °C with different catalyst loadings. Five
grams (27.7 mmol) of olefin was used. Both 1 g of dh-BN activated for 48 h under hydrogen (a) and nonactivated h-BN-coated milling media (b) effectively hydrogenated the
olefinic bond.

Results and Discussion
Defects have been shown to be important features of active catalytic
solids21−23 and are responsible for the increased activity observed
in catalysts prepared mechanochemically24 as well as catalysts under the application of mechanical force.25 These results suggest that a defect-laden solid
with regions of electron deficiency and excess will interact with
olefins and molecular hydrogen to reduce their respective bond orders
enough to facilitate hydrogenation. Prior work on hydrogen storage
examined the role of defects in h-BN. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations show a favorable binding energy for hydrogen
on nitrogen vacancies (VN), boron vacancies (VB), boron nitrogen swap (B/N), boron substitution for nitrogen (BN), nitrogen substitution for boron (NB), carbon
substitution (BC and NC), silicon substitution
(NSi and BSi), and Stone–Wales (SW) defects.19 We assessed two five-membered-ring and two seven-membered-ring
SW defects. These defects can cause the sheet to distort above (SW1)
or below the original plane (SW2). SW2 had the most favorable interaction
with the substrate. Chemisorption of hydrogen (up 70% of the adsorbed
hydrogen) is favored over these sites.19,26 In fact, single
sheets and nanotubes of BN can absorb up to 4.6 mass % hydrogen.26,27 If h-BN has a high affinity for hydrogen, then
it may also have a high affinity for olefins. We omitted silicon-substituted
structures and examined the eight remaining defects for affinity for
olefin and hydrogen binding (Figures S16 and S17). We found that four of these defects exhibited an affinity for
olefins. Binding-energy calculations (Table 1) confirm this assertion, with the binding
energies of ethene, propene, and hydrogen being at par with those
of metals that possess known hydrogenation activity (Pt, Pd, and Ni).
Of these defects, BN and VN have binding energies
closest to those of metals with known hydrogenation activity. Olefin
binding at SW defects is less favored (desorption may reduce the availability
of activated species), and hydrogen binding is disfavored. Binding
at VB sites is highly favored for both the olefin and hydrogen,
and the reactivity will be limited. Solid-state NMR (SSNMR) experiments
on propene-saturated dh-BN showed a low concentration
of BN sites and a much higher concentration of VN sites. Additionally, there is evidence of VN formation
after ball milling, and VN are some of the most stable
defects in h-BN.28−30

Producing Defects
Pristine sheets of h-BN are exceptionally robust and chemically inert;26,35,36 the application of mechanical force is required
to induce delamination and introduce point defects.37 By designing a hydrogenation reactor around a pebble mill,
we have been able to study the catalytic activity of defects in h-BN. The continuous grinding motion within the mill prevents
cluster formation, maximizes the number of few-layer sheets, and induces
plastic deformation in the catalyst. To verify the presence of these
sheets and defects, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used
to characterize the morphology of the dh-BN catalyst
(Figure S20b,c). Nanosheets are observed
by TEM and appear to form tubular structures or nanoscrolls, as seen
in Figure S20c. Although point defects
could not be imaged directly, the material shows significant disruption
of the structure (Figure S20a,b). Powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of pristine and defect-laden h-BN (dh-BN) (Figures S18 and S19) shows disorder in the c-direction, consistent
with delamination and retention of order in the sheet. Propene uptake
experiments (Figure S3) indicate a defect
level of 0.46 mol %. Integral breadth analysis using the 00l and hk0
peaks found that the average crystalline region in the sheet was 6.7
nm, with 0.56% strain, and the average crystallite size in the c-direction was 18.3 nm (or 55 h-BN layers),
with 0.23% strain. The higher in-sheet strain is indicative of defects
and is confirmed by TEM images.

Bulk-Scale Experiments
Nearly complete hydrogenation,
of substrates without acidic functional groups, was achieved with
reactor temperatures as low as 20 °C. This temperature is much
lower than that used for industrial hydroprocessing (300–450
°C).38 No aromatic carbons were hydrogenated,
such as that over Raney nickel.39 Benzylideneacetophenone
was not reduced to an alcohol, such as that with metal-based catalysts.
Additionally, no C–H activation products were observed, as
was reported over nanocrystals of h-BN.27 The hydrogenation product of phenylethene (a
known product of the thermal decomposition of (E)-cinnamic
acid [7]) was observed in the by-products of the hydrogenation of
(E)-cinnamic acid [7] at 170 °C.40 For all substrates, except the two carboxylic
acids, the upper limits for the TOFs were determined from the steepest
slope of the hydrogen uptake curve (Figure 2) and from propene adsorption studies (Figure S3). For the carboxylic acids, TOFs were
determined from the product yield and total reaction time. Turnover
numbers were calculated assuming deactivation after one reaction,
although we have been able to recycle the catalyst three times with
minimal loss of catalytic efficiency (Figure S21). The results are presented in Table 2, as are those for other catalytic systems. The TOFs
over dh-BN are better than those achieved using FLPs
for the same substrate. Although the internal sheet atoms of a single h-BN layer are relatively inert, the defects and edges are
potentially reactive. In the presence of hydrogen, the edges of the dh-BN sheets possess reactive species, which reductively
aminate carboxylic acids. Lower yields of hydrogenation products were
realized from reactions with (E)-cinnamic acid [7]
(Table S1) and (9Z)-octadec-9-enoic
acid [8], as a result of reaction of the carboxylic acid group with
these edges. This is evidenced by the production of nitriles from
these reagents (Table 2). Nitriles are produced by reaction of the carboxylic acid with
the edge nitrogens on the dh-BN sheet, followed by
dehydration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the
catalyst after hydrogenation confirmed the presence of carbon on the
surface (Figure S14d), and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of the catalyst after propene hydrogenation shows that
coking is reduced at lower temperatures (Figure S14c).

Metal-Free Hydrogenation
Small amounts of metal impurities
can lead to the observation of anomalous catalytic activity,41 and hydrogenation over stainless steel has recently
been observed.42 Mechanical processing
can introduce metals into the material through wear of the media and
vessel. The two main components of steel used are iron and nickel.
Both of these metals can be active toward hydrogenation. Nickel is
a known hydrogenation catalyst, and iron acts as a catalyst when in
the nanoparticle form.43,44 In a previous study using graphite,
iron was not incorporated into the product even after extended milling
times.45 Inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission analysis (ICP-AES) of the boron nitride
before and after activation indicated that little metal incorporation
occurred. The starting material contained no detectable iron or nickel.
After activation, the material had 7 ppm of iron and 10 ppm of nickel.

Mechanically Equivalent Blank
The effect of a small
amount of metal contamination was examined by substituting graphite
and graphitic C3N4 for boron nitride. Both have
mechanical properties similar to those of boron nitride and exhibit
wear behavior. Although graphite is a suitable support for iron and
nickel catalysts, it lacks the electronic structure needed for hydrogen
and alkene binding. Both, graphite and C3N4,
were processed in a hydrogen atmosphere in the same manner as was
boron nitride and then used in (E)-cinnamic acid
[7] hydrogenation reactions at 170 °C and propene [1] hydrogenation
reactions at 20 °C. No hydrogen uptake or hydrogenation products
were observed.

Rigorously Metal-Free Implementation
To further eliminate the possibility of metal-mediated hydrogenation,
a metal-free (alumina) reactor was constructed (Figure S2c). Additionally, propene was chosen as a substrate,
as it would be free from metal impurities that may be found in liquid
or solid substrates. Initially, propene [1] was hydrogenated with
90% efficiency after a much longer induction period.

Mechanical
Factors Affecting Induction Periods and Reaction
Rates
Discrete elemental models of the reactors used in this
study indicated that the compressive forces achieved in both the steel
and alumina reactors were comparable. However, the total amount of
compressive force delivered over a 10 s time period was significantly
less for the alumina reactor (Figure S15d). Without activation, a significant induction period (over 16 h; Figure S21) was observed. The initial activation
step, which produces dh-BN, was performed with 20
g of the material. At such a high loading, the impacts of the media
are dampened. By activating a smaller amount (5 g) of boron nitride,
the induction period was eliminated and stoichiometric yields were
obtained (Figure 2).

Defects, which are stable up to 900 °C,49 can be produced during hydrogenation or in a pretreatment
step. However, they must be mobile for the bound hydrogen and olefin
to interact. Defects are mobile during plastic deformation,50 which occurs when the yield strength of a material
is exceeded. The motion of defects in h-BN nanotubes
has been observed under applied load51 as
well as modeled in h-BN sheets52 and the forces generated during milling can be sufficient
to exceed the compressive yield strength of h-BN
(41.3 MPa). However, the generation of high forces during milling
requires efficient transfer of mechanical force to dh-BN. Therefore, the rheological properties of the reaction mixture
during hydrogenation are important factors. There must be media (ball)–media
impacts or media–wall impacts for force to be transferred to
the reaction. This occurs as frictional forces allow the media to
climb up the wall of the rotating reactor. At a certain point, gravity
predominates and the media tumble (A video of this process is supplied
in the Supporting Information). Liquids,
such as octadec-1-ene [3], lower the impact forces by reducing friction
and eliminating tumbling. They are effective lubricants. If tumbling
is reduced or eliminated, impact forces are reduced and the amount
of plastic deformation experienced by the dh-BN catalyst
is limited. Consequently, lower hydrogenation yields were obtained
when pure octadec-1-ene [3] was utilized. Discrete element method
(DEM) models showed that the lowered coefficients of restitution,
static friction, and rolling friction produced by lubrication significantly
reduced the number of high-force impacts. By adding 5 mass % fumed
silica, the lubricity of the mixture was greatly reduced and hydrogenation
proceeded rapidly.

Surface Analyses, Bound Species, and Sites
Two separate
samples were prepared, and 13C isotropic spectra were acquired
for each. The first sample was exposed to propene under a pressure
of 310 kPa for 4 days, whereas the second sample was exposed to small
quantities of propene present in our Ar-filled glovebox (partial pressure
<100 Pa or 4.5 ppt). Both samples show some uptake of propene,
best observed from the presence of methyl signals from 5 to 30 ppm
(Figure 3) and from
the thermograms (Figure S12). The surface
area of the parent BN was 5 m2/g. After activation by milling
in a zirconia vial, the surface area increased to 340 m2/g, and it decreased to 270 m2/g upon exposure to propene.
This suggests that propene tightly binds to a fraction of the adsorption
sites or 0.70 mass % of the catalyst.

Figure 3 13C SSNMR of dh-BN exposed to high
and low partial pressures of propene. The peaks around 25 ppm are
due to the methyl carbon on propene and show four distinct binding
modes. The peaks at 62 and 83 ppm are likely due to partial oxidation
of the bound propene molecule. The spectra were obtained using a cross-polarization
technique.

The presence of five distinct
CH3 resonances in each
sample indicates that multiple environments are available to propene.
This is consistent with the presence of at least five structurally
unique defect sites. A tentative assignment of each site can be made
using prior work establishing that methyl groups at lower frequencies
represent those most sterically imposed upon by neighboring sites.53−55 A summary of C–H···X steric interactions (X
= N or B) for each structural model is given in Table 3. Site 1, represented by the signal near
7 ppm, is only occupied at low surface coverages and, on the basis
of the 13C shift, is expected to display the most significant
steric interactions with neighboring atoms. This resonance is thus
assigned to structural model BN, with four C–H···X
interactions <3.0 Å. In contrast, the narrow resonance near
10 ppm (2) is exclusively occupied in the sample exposed to higher
propene partial pressures. Structural model VB is consistent
with this resonance as it has three C–H···X
steric interactions, with the shortest interaction distance. The two
sites with signals at 17 and 25 ppm (resonances 3 and 4, respectively)
are found in both samples and are therefore occupied regardless of
the preparation condition. Site 3 is consistent with VN, whereas site 4 is tentatively assigned to model SW2, with two C–H···X
contacts <3.0 Å. It is notable that the resonance near 17
ppm is also more strongly represented in the pressurized sample. Site
5 near 30 ppm is the least sterically involved with neighboring sites
and is thus assigned to structural model SW1, with one C–H···X
interaction <3.0 Å.

and SW2 consist of two

structures
provided in the Supporting Information.

Overall, these 13C NMR results suggest that there are
at least five structurally distinct sites and that some are solely
or preferentially occupied at higher pressures. We note that the olefinic
carbons are also observed in the spectrum at 107 ppm (tentatively
assigned as CH) and at 122–127 ppm (CH2). These
are less useful for analysis due to the low signal-to-noise ratio,
but help verify the presence of propene. Curiously, in both samples
an additional resonance is observed at 62 and 83 ppm in the high-
and low-pressure samples, respectively. This is consistent with the
formation of two distinct species containing C–O bonds, perhaps
from oxidation of the double bond after the sample was briefly exposed
to air when transferred to the NMR. This is consistent with the results
of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in air, which show an exotherm
at 62 °C (Figure S13), whereas temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) the material not exposed to air reveals a desorption
peak at 287 °C (Figure 4).

is similar to that from defect-laden surfaces.56,57

Catalytically Active Defects
and Reaction Mechanism
Hydrogenation over traditional metal
catalysts proceeds through the
Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism, where the olefin adsorbs onto a
hydrogenated catalyst surface, hydrogen migrates to the β carbon
of the olefin, and the free alkane is reductively eliminated from
the surface.58 This is significantly different
from the mechanism of olefin activation using an FLP. In an FLP system,
hydrogenation proceeds via three steps: addition of molecular hydrogen
to the FLP, olefin protonation to form a carbocation, and hydride
transfer to the carbocation.59 This also
differs from hydrogenation observed over acid zeolites where the olefin
first reacts with an acidic proton to form a transient carbonium ion.60 To understand this process, it is useful to
evaluate the binding energy and electronic structure of the propene
molecule on the boron nitride substrate. Ethene (C2H4), the simplest possible molecule with such a bond, and propene
were investigated. First-principles electronic structure calculations
of C2H4 and C3H8 molecules
on a single h-BN layer were employed by utilizing
the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF).61,62 It quickly became clear that these olefins do not chemisorb onto
pristine h-BN sheets. This was also noted for hydrogen
adsorption on h-BN sheets, which is at best weakly
favored.19 Olefin chemisorption occurs
at four of the eight defects investigated.

The effect that these
defects have on the carbon double bond can be elucidated by focusing
on hybridization of the olefinic carbons interacting with the defect.
A comparison of the charge density along a vertical plane passing
through the two C atoms to that for gas-phase C2H4 and C2H6 illustrates the effect of the substrate
(Figure 5). When ethene
or propene chemisorbs onto a BN defect, its C atoms partially
retain their original sp2 hybridization (C=C), but
when the molecule adsorbs onto an SW, VB, or VN defect, its C atoms rehybridize to sp3 (C–C),
facilitating hydrogenation and desorption of C2H6. The results also hold for the adsorption of propene onto defect-laden
BN. Coupled with the previously calculated binding modes of H2 on h-BN19 defects, the data suggests
that the hydrogenation mechanism is closer to the Horiuti–Polanyi
mechanism for olefin hydrogenation over metals than that proposed
for FLP-catalyzed hydrogenation or acid-zeolite-catalyzed hydrogenation.
The significant difference between hydrogen bound to defects on an h-BN sheet and that bound to a metal surface is that the
resultant protons bound to the surface are confined to the region
by the defect.

Figure 5 Electronic density cross sections plotted along the vertical
plane,
passing through the center of the two carbon atoms of gas-phase (A)
ethene (C2H4), (B) ethane (C2H6), and (C) C2H4/dh-BN
for the defects BN, SW, VN, and VB. Contours are drawn in a linear scale (nine contours from 0 to 0.27
e/bohr3). It can be seen that the electronic density of
ethene on dh-BN exhibits a similar structure to that
of C3H6, indicating a reduction of the bond
order of the C–C bond in the adsorbed ethene.

It is difficult to unambiguously identify the active
site and hydrogenation
mechanism. This is mainly due to the fact that there are many possible
defects on the surface and due to the dynamic nature of the milling
process. On the basis of the binding energies of propene, the calculated
C=C bond lengths, and the SSNMR data as well as previous studies
on the binding of hydrogen to defects in h-BN, it
is most likely that hydrogenation occurs over VN. The calculated
binding energy of propene is at par with that of catalytic metals
(Table 1). The C–C
bond length of adsorbed propene (1.566 Å) is closer to the C–C
bond length of propane (Table 3). The reaction pathway of propene hydrogenation on this defect
is shown in Figure 6. The minimum energy path for such a hydrogenation starts with the
practically barrierless adsorption of propene (with a barrier of 5
meV), followed by dissociative adsorption of H2, with a
barrier of 0.52 eV, to form a co-adsorption state (C3H6* + 2H*), with a co-adsorption binding energy of 2.22 eV.
C3H6* then picks an atomic hydrogen (H*) to
form CH2CH2CH3*. This reaction has
a barrier of 0.50 eV. C3H7* will then react
with the remaining H* to form propane. This reaction faces a large
barrier of 1.53 eV (148 kJ/mol). An alternative pathway for forming
the co-adsorption state is also calculated. In this pathway, the dissociative
adsorption of H2 occurs first, with a barrier of 1.01 eV,
followed by the adsorption of propene with a barrier of 0.37 eV. Hydrogenation
over a VB has a much larger barrier of 3.67 eV (Figure S22).

Figure 6 The barrier (in electronvolts) for each
elementary reaction step
is calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band method63 and is shown by the number (eV) between the
states. The largest barrier in the minimum energy pathway of propene
hydrogenation over VNis 1.53 eV (148 kJ/mol). The zero
potential energy corresponds to propene and hydrogen in the gas phase
without any interaction with h-BN. The thick horizontal
bars represent intermediate states. *Adsorbed species. The insets
are structures of (a) co-adsorbed propene and hydrogen (C3H6* + 2H*) and (b) intermediate state C3H7*.

It is worth noting that the calculated
barriers are low enough
for facile reactions under experimental conditions (room temperature
and the application of mechanical force). Reactions with activation
energies between 95 and 134 kJ/mol have been driven mechanochemically,64−68 and our computed maximum barrier is not far outside this range.
Our calculated barrier lies between that for propene hydrogenation
over zeolites (58–90 kJ/mol)60 and
that for hydrogenation of propene over a silica-supported Zn(II) catalyst
(191 kJ/mol).69

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of dh-BN
dh-BN was prepared
using three methods. For all of these methods, pristine h-BN (Grade PCTF5; Saint-Gobain Ceramic Materials) was first
dried at 180 °C under dynamic vacuum for 12 h and transferred
to an argon-filled glovebox.

Method 1
Approximately 2 g of h-BN
was mixed with 0.200 g of lithium (99.9%, Alfa-Aesar) and reacted
via high-energy ball milling in an 8000M and/or 8000D SPEX CertiPrep
mixer/mill. Milling vials were constructed from 440C stainless steel,
with an approximate volume of 65 mL. Buna-N quad o-rings were used
to maintain a seal during milling. Kinetic energy was supplied for
30 min with one 12.7 mm stainless steel ball weighing approximately
8.0 g. After 30 min, two additional 12.7 mm stainless steel balls
were added, and the reaction was milled for an additional 7.5 h. The
resulting lithiated solid was subsequently hydrolyzed using excess
H2O to remove Li3N, producing vacancies in the h-BN sheets. The morphology of this dh-BN
was examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) performed on a
Tescan Vega SBH operating at 30 kV (Figure S1d).

Method 2
Dry h-BN (20 g) was loaded
into a custom pebble mill in an argon-filled glovebox. The milling
container was made of 304 stainless steel. Spherical milling media
(440C) were added in the following quantities and sizes: (12) 19.1
mm balls, (27) 12.7 mm balls, and (50) 6.35 mm balls. The mill was
run at 60 rpm for 96 h under 929 kPa of ultrahigh purity hydrogen.
The milling container was transferred to an argon-filled glovebox,
and the prepared catalyst powder was removed and stored until use.

Method 3
Dry h-BN (5 g) was loaded
into a 65 mL zirconia milling vial. Silicone o-rings and a custom
clamping mechanism were used to maintain a seal during milling. Kinetic
energy was supplied for 30 min with four 12.7 mm zirconia balls weighing
approximately 5.97 g each. The material was removed with plastic tools,
and at no point in its preparation was it exposed to metal. The resulting
defect-laden solid was used for catalysis without further processing.
The morphology of this material is shown in the TEM images in Figure S20. It was found that activation by milling
alone was just as effective as using lithium. Higher-energy activation
(method 3) resulted in shorter induction periods (Figure 2). All hydrogenation data presented
in this article are from mechanically activated BN.

Hydrogenation
Hydrogenation was performed in a custom
pebble mill with gas-tight milling containers made of 304 stainless
steel and high alumina (Figure S2). The
reaction vessel is shaped as a double truncated cone to ensure adequate
tumbling of the milling media.

Steel
Two 2.75
in. Conflat flanges (A&N Corporation
CF275 flanges with a 1.5 in. bore, 275–162) were welded onto
two 1.5 × 3 in.2 conical reducers (A&N Corporation
300X150-WCR) welded large end to end to produce the reaction vessel
in Figure S2. Deublin rotary feedthroughs
(1005-020-019, 1005 Series, RH and 1005-020-039, 1005 Series, LH)
retrofit with Kalrez o-rings and Krytox lubricant (GPL 105) were used
to maintain gas-tight conditions during operation. The feedthroughs
were sealed to two 2.75 in. Conflat flanges with 10–32 tapped-through
holes (A&N Corporation; CF275 blank flanges 275-000). The seal
between the feedthrough and the flange was maintained with a copper
gasket. Stainless steel frits (6–32 threaded) (applied porous
materials) were fitted to the tapped entry and exit feedthroughs to
eliminate the accumulation of dust in the sealing surfaces of the
feedthroughs. The flange seals were maintained with either two silicone
or Kalrez o-rings (ASA-223), depending on the substrate being used
at the time. Spherical milling media (440C, d = 7.67
g/cm3) was added in the following quantities and sizes:
(12) 19.1 mm balls, (53) 12.7 mm balls, and (86) 6.35 mm balls.

Alumina
Two alumina reactor designs were implemented.
A small ceramic-lined reactor with straight sides was constructed
by boring holes in the bottom and lid of a high-alumina crucible (99.8%,
Part #65540; CoorsTek). The crucible was used to line a steel reactor
with parallel walls and Conflat flanges. A high-temperature room temperature
vulcanizing sealant (tin-cured) was used to seal the crucible lid
onto the body. The steel frits were replaced with glass filters. Spherical
milling media (yttria-stabilized zirconia, d = 6
g/cm3, Inframat Advanced Materials LLC) was added in the
following quantities and sizes: (5) 19.1 mm balls, (15) 12.7 mm balls,
and (50) 6.35 mm balls. A duplicate of the steel reactor, with a high
alumina content (99.8%) and 6 mm walls, was manufactured by CoorsTek,
Inc. Titanium flanges with the same dimensions as those of the steel
flanges, except that the Conflat knife edge was replaced by an o-ring
groove, were machined. Titanium was chosen to match the coefficient
of thermal expansion of the alumina body and reduce the risk associated
with incorporation of catalytically active metals. The titanium flanges
were anodized to reduce the possibility of hydrogen embrittlement.
The flanges were sealed to the alumina body using Cotronics Duralco
4700 two-part epoxy. A 1 mm thick polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) shield
was placed between the frit body and the flange to eliminate the interaction
of the media with the flange material. The steel frit was covered
with a piece of tin-cured silicone tube (i.d. = 6.35 mm) to prevent
the media from interacting with the steel of the frit. Spherical milling
media (yttria-stabilized zirconia, d = 6 g/cm3, Inframat Advanced Materials LLC) were added in the following
quantities and sizes: (12) 20 mm balls, (53) 12.7 mm balls, and (86)
6.35 mm balls. Before any hydrogenation, the media and reactor interior
were washed with concentrated nitric acid and rinsed three times with
ultrapure water.

Control
Temperature was controlled
with an Omega CN3000
process controller and a K-type thermocouple spring mounted to the
inlet flange. A wound NiChrome heating element embedded in a shaped
firebrick applied heat. The pressure was monitored with a NOSHOK pressure
transducer and controlled with a MicroMod 53MC5000 loop controller.
The mill’s rotational speed was controlled with a 1/3 hp variable
speed DC motor coupled to the reactor with a steel drive chain.

Reactions
Hydrogenations were performed with 5 g of
substrate and varying quantities of catalyst (trace to 7.5 g of dh-BN). Hydrogenations
were performed with 5 g of substrate and trace to 7.5 g of dh-BN. Trace quantities of dh-BN were introduced
into the reactor by suspending 1 g of dh-BN in 200
mL of dry acetone and pouring it over the milling media. The wet media
were then dried at 100 °C. The substrates investigated were as
follows: propene [1] (Worthington Industries, 95%), allyl bromide
(Fisher Scientific, 99%), allyl butyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich, 90%),
phenylethene (Acros Organics, 99%), cyclohexene [2] (Fisher Scientific),
octadec-1-ene [3] (Acros Organics 90%), d-limonene (Florida
Chemical, technical grade), 1,1-diphenylethene [4] (Sigma-Aldrich,
97%), (Z)-1,2-diphenylethene [5] (Alfa-Aesar 97%),
(E)-1,2-diphenylethene [6] (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%),
(E)-cinnamic acid [7] (Eastman, Practical Grade),
(9Z)-Octadec-9-enoic acid [8] (Fisher Scientific,
Lab Grade), benzylideneacetophenone [9] (Acros Organics, 97%), and
eugenol [10] (clove bud oil, Nature’s Alchemy, 80–90%).

Mechanically Similar Blanks
Dry graphite and dry graphitic
carbon nitride (C3N4) were used as blanks, with
mechanical properties similar to those of BN. Graphitic carbon nitride
was prepared by heating 10 g of dicyandiamide (Alfa Aesar 99%) for
1 h in air at 500 °C. Two grams of each compound was loaded into
the reactor in an argon-filled glovebox. Hydrogenation activity was
examined by milling 20 g of (E)-cinnamic acid [7]
with 2 g of processed graphite at 170 °C, pressures between 446
and 1135 kPa, and rotary speeds of 66 rpm. Hydrogenation of propene
with graphitic carbon nitride was investigated by milling 2 g of g-C3N4 at 425 kPa of an equimolar
mixture of hydrogen and propene at 20 °C.

Active Sites
Active sites were measured by loading
the steel reactor with 5 g of dh-BN and pressurizing
to 345 kPa with propane, propene, hydrogen, or argon. Surface adsorption
produced a measureable pressure loss. No pressure loss was observed
for argon, and it was minimal for hydrogen. Both propane (which is
expected to physisorb) and propene (which is expected to chemisorb
as well as physisorb) showed pressure loss with more loss observed
using propene (Figure S3).

Surface Area
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area testing was performed with a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 instrument
at 77 K. Before measurement, each sample was evacuated on a Smart
Vac Prep for 5 h at 50 °C. The surface areas of pristine, defect-laden,
and propene-adsorbed defect-laden BN were measured.

TPD
The TPD experiment was carried out with an Altamira
AMI-200 instrument, using ethene as an adsorbed gas.

SSNMR
All SSNMR spectra were acquired on a 500 MHz
Agilent narrow-bore spectrometer operating at 125.68 MHz. A 1.6 mm
Agilent T3 probe was employed using a spinning speed of 12.0 kHz.
A 1H pulse width of 1.0 μs was utilized, followed
by a conventional (i.e., constant amplitude) cross-polarization step,
with a time of 3 ms. SPINAL 1H decoupling at a frequency
of 499.78 MHz was employed using a 165° pulse of 1.84 μs.
Both spectra were acquired using spectral widths of 29.8 kHz, acquisition
times of 17.2 ms, and recycle times of 15 s to avoid sample heating.
The digital resolution acquired for each spectrum was of 58.1 Hz/point.

Coking
After use in hydrogenation, the dh-BN exhibited a color change from white to brown (Figure S14a). The color deepened at elevated reaction temperatures,
with little observed color change for propene hydrogenations performed
at room temperature. This color change was due to the incorporation
of carbon compounds. This coking was highly fluorescent (Figure S14b). TGA was performed on a TA Instruments
model, 2050 TGA. The results for coked and pristine materials are
shown in Figure S14c.

Gas Chromatography
(GC) with Mass-Sensitive Detection
GC–mass spectrometry
(MS) analysis was performed on Agilent
6850 GC, with an Agilent 19091-433E HP-5MS column (5% phenyl methyl
siloxane, 30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm nom.) coupled
with a 5975C VL mass-selective detector. Samples were extracted from
the reactor, dissolved in dichloromethane, and filtered through a
Whatman 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter before injection. Quantitation
of the (E)-cinnamic acid [7] hydrogenation products
was performed using external standard solutions of (E)-cinnamic acid [7] (Eastman, Practical Grade) and hydrocinnamic
acid (Acros Organics, 99%) in dichloromethane.

Gas samples from
propene [1] hydrogenation experiments were obtained by venting the
reactor into a 50 mL serum vial crimp sealed with a PTFE-lined septum.
Gas was introduced via a 22 gauge needle attached to the vent line
and an additional 22 gauge exit needle that was properly vented. Quantitation
of the propene/propane ratios was performed using external standards
consisting of mixtures of propene and propane.

ICP-AES
ICP-AES was performed by Saint-Gobain Advanced
Ceramics. Samples of boron nitride before and after activation were
digested in an oxygen bomb and analyzed for iron and nickel.

X-ray
Photoelectron Spectra (XPS)
XPS were recorded
on a Physical Electronics 5400 photoelectron spectrometer with a magnesium
source. The spectra of the carbon 1s region is presented in Figure S14d.

XRD
PXRD was performed
using a Rigaku Multiflex theta–theta
powder X-ray diffractometer with a copper source (Cu Kα = 1.5418
Å). Diffractograms were collected from 5 to 80° 2θ
using 0.010° steps and a 0.3 s dwell time. Size and strain were
analyzed by applying the method of integral breadths70 and constructing a Williamson–Hall plot. Sheet parallel
and perpendicular diffraction peaks were analyzed separately to obtain
in-sheet size and strain and intersheet ordering.

TGA and DSC
Pristine, defect-laden, and propene-adsorbed
BN samples were studied with TA Instruments 2950 TGA and 2920 DSC.
Propene-adsorbed samples were prepared by loading a 500 mL pressure
cell with 2 g of material in an argon-filled glovebox. The pressure
cell was then removed and filled with 310.3 kPa of propene. The sample
was allowed to equilibrate for 3 days and then removed from the cell
and stored in an argon-filled glovebox. TGA samples were stored in
argon-filled vials and loaded into the sample pan in air. TGA runs
were performed under flowing air. DSC samples were loaded into unsealed
aluminum pans under argon and loaded into the DSC cell in air. All
defect-laden samples were found to retain their propene even after
extended storage at 1 atm.

Discrete Element Modeling (DEM)
DEMs of the milling
process were generated using EDEM (DEM Solutions Ltd.). The geometry
and composition of the reaction vessel was investigated using DEM.
Three reaction vessels were investigated: steel (Figure S15a, left), one with a high alumina content and sloped
sides (Figure S15a, center), and one with
a high alumina and straight sides (Figure S15a, right).

TOF
TOFs were estimated using the
minimum of the derivative
of each substrate’s hydrogen uptake curve as the maximum rate
of hydrogenation.

Computational Details
DFT calculations
were performed
to evaluate the binding energies and electronic structure of the C2H4 molecule on defected boron nitride single layers
employing the formalism of the vdW-DF,61,62 as implemented
in the VASP code.71−74 In this formalism, the exchange-correlation energy is calculated
as EXC = EGGAX + ElcC + EnlcC, where EGGAX is a semilocal exchange functional from the
revised generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (revPBE),75ElcC is the local correlation energy described
within the local density approximation, and EnlcC is the nonlocal
correlation energy, as described by Dion et al.61 The efficient algorithm proposed by Román–Pérez
and Soler76 is responsible for making the
computation feasible for systems such as ours, which contain a large
number of atoms in the calculational super cell. The projector augmented
wave scheme77,78 is utilized, with the potentials
taken from the potential library provided with VASP. The electronic
wave functions were expanded in a plane wave basis set, with a cutoff
of 500 eV. Given the size
of the super cell, a single k-point (γ) was deemed adequate
to sample the Brillouin zone of a (6 × 6) BN slab with 15 Å
vacuum on top of it. The systems were optimized so that all force
components acting on each atom are smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. The
lattice parameters of h-BN were optimized to be 2.523
Å (in agreement with the experimental value of 2.505 Å79). No temperature or pressure effects were included
in our DFT calculations.

Binding Energies
The binding energy
is calculated using
the formula EBE = Esystem – (Emol + EBN), where Esystem, Emol, and EBN are the total energy of the molecule on the substrate, of the molecule
alone, and of the defective h-BN substrate, respectively.

Conclusions
A new metal-free heterogeneous hydrogenation
catalyst has been
realized through the introduction of defects into h-BN sheets. Stoichiometric yields were obtained for both simple olefins
(propene [1]) and complex olefins (benzylideneacetophenone [9]), with
TOFs 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those for catalytic
hydrogenation of the same olefin over metal-free FLPs and graphene
catalysts. Superior selectivity was observed, with minimal dehydrogenation
and no cracking products produced at low temperatures. Through the application
of a metal-free reactor, we confirmed that the observed hydrogenation
is due to dh-BN and not due to the introduced metal
impurities. DFT calculations show that the olefinic bond in ethene
and propene is weakened over four types of defect sites: boron substitution
for nitrogen (BN), nitrogen (VN) vacancies,
boron (VB) vacancies, and SW defects. The binding energy
for olefins and hydrogen at the VN defect is at par with
that of metals currently used for catalytic hydrogenation. It is most
likely that the majority of catalytic activity is due to VN defects. The use of metal-free hydrogenation catalysts will reduce
the risks associated with the incorporation of metals into hydrogenation
products.
