Subcritical water extraction (SWE) uses hot compressed water as
an effective solvent for both polar and nonpolar compounds and has
been developed as an environmentally benign extraction technology
for natural materials. Polysaccharides as one of the main ingredients
in Dendrobium plants showed obvious
biological activity. Thus, SWE of polysaccharides obtained from Dendrobium nobile Lindl. was investigated in this
work. The response surface methodology (RSM) was combined with a Box–Behnken
design to evaluate the influence that the three independent variables
had on the response. The optimal extraction conditions (determined
via RSM) were 129.83 °C extraction temperature, 16.71 min extraction
time, and 1.12 MPa extraction pressure. The maximum predicted polysaccharide
yield was 20.67%, which corresponded well with the experiential extraction
(21.88%). The polysaccharides obtained from either the stirring extraction,
refluxing extraction, ultrasound extraction, or SWE methods were compared,
and the extraction processes were modeled. The molecular weight, monosaccharide
composition, and antioxidative activities of the polysaccharides were
analyzed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Dendrobium nobile Lindl., Orchidaceae,
is a herbal plant commonly used in Chinese traditional medicine and
it is one of the several Dendrobium species that were specified in the Chinese Pharmacopeia.1,2 Previous research has shown that Dendrobium has applications as an agent in antioxidants, and also have anticancer,
immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective activity.3 Many compounds have been extracted and isolated
from the Dendrobium species to better
understand these health functions,4 including
polysaccharides,5,6 alkaloids,7,8 phenolics,9,10 phenanthrenes,11 and bibenzyls.12,13 Other chemical constituents were detected in Dendrobium
officinale, such as phenols, acids, esters, and amides.14 Polysaccharides are considered to be one of
the main active components in Dendrobium plants,15 demonstrating antitumor,16 antiviral,17 antihyperglycemic,
and immunomodulatory activities.18,19 Moreover,
polysaccharides as ideal biodegradable polymer materials can be used
as drug carrier, food packaging, pharmaceutical preparations, and
so forth.20,21

Most of the previous research pertaining to the compounds in the
polysaccharides from D. nobile Lindl.,
have focused on their structural characteristics and pharmacological
properties. Wang et al. reported that some of the D.
nobile polysaccharides displayed remarkable immunomodulatory
effects. Bioactive tests in vitro revealed that five water-soluble
polysaccharides (DNP-W1B, DNP-W2, DNP-W3, DNP-W4, and DNP-W5) could
stimulate ConA- and LPS-induced T and B lymphocyte proliferation.22−26 They also found that D. nobile polysaccharides
have strong antitumor activities, and two water-soluble polysaccharides
(DNP-W1 and DNP-W3) exhibited high antitumor activities against Sarcoma
180 in vivo and HL-60 in vitro. Polysaccharides were extracted thrice
by distilled water for 2 h at 80 °C.27 Li et al. isolated and characterized a neutral polysaccharide (DNPE6(4))
from D. nobile Lindl and studied its
anti-TMV and anti-CMV activities for the first time in vivo.28 Some others extracted and purified homogeneous
heteropolysaccharides which could alleviate vinorelbine-induced decrease
of macrophages in vivo29 and presented
significant immune-modulating activities.30,31 Luo et al. extracted polysaccharides from the stem of the D. nobile Lindl. three times with hot water for 2
h each time, where the structure of the polysaccharides were characterized
and the antioxidant activities were evaluated in vitro.32,33 They evaluated the mechanism of the antitumor activities and the
immunomodulation effects of the four polysaccharide fractions taken
from the D. nobile Lindl. in vivo.34 Pan et al. reported polysaccharides taken from
four different Dendrobium species were
extracted thrice with boiling distilled water, each time for 0.5 h,
where their hypoglycemic and antioxidative activities were compared
in vivo.35 Hot water extraction remains
the most common extraction method for polysaccharides. This method
is typically time-consuming, laborious, and has low selectivity and/or
low extraction yields,36 making it necessary
to bring forth novel extraction methods that would circumvent this.

Subcritical water extraction (SWE) uses hot compressed water as
an effective solvent for polar and nonpolar compounds, where it is
developed as an environmentally benign extraction technology for natural
materials.37,38 Subcritical water is liquid water
under pressure, at a temperature range between the usual boiling point
(100 °C) and critical temperature (374.1 °C).39,40 At these conditions, the thermal motion of water molecules increases,
thus changing its properties.41 Cooler
water should extract more water-soluble organic compounds, whereas
hotter temperature water should extract less soluble organic compounds.
The pressure determines the state of the water by changing the density
to enhance water solvency.42 SWE has been
used to extract polyphenolic and antioxidant compounds from many natural
products,43−45 although it has not been used as an extraction method
for polysaccharides from the D. nobile Lindl. In this work, we proposed SWE as a feasible processing method
for the extraction for polysaccharides from the D.
nobile Lindl. The study used the Box–Behnken
design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the
extraction experiments. The polysaccharides were analyzed via UV–vis
spectrophotometry. The extraction process was modeled and the polysaccharide’s
antioxidative activities were analyzed.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials and Chemicals
The dry stem
of the D. nobile Lindl. was purchased
from Sichuan Wanan Industrial Development Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China).
The dry mushroom was obtain from Jiangnan biotechnology Co., Ltd.
(Jiangsu, China). Reference standard glucose (GC purity > 99.5%) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The other
chemicals were of analytical reagent grade.

2.2 Subcritical Water Extraction
SWE
was performed on a stainless steel batch reactor (inner volume 100
mL), constructed in house. A schematic drawing of the SWE is presented
in Figure 1. The dry
stem of the D. nobile Lindl. was ground
in a mill until the powder was less than 0.45 mm. The powder material
and purified water were placed in the vessel at a solid to liquid
ratio of 1:25 (g/mL). The vessel was then sealed and purged with inert
N2. The extraction pressure (0.5–1.5 MPa) was controlled
at a predetermined value. The reactor was heated to the experimental
temperature (120–160 °C) by an electric heater. The mixture
was agitated by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm. The pressure and temperature
inside the reactor during each experiment were measured by the pressure
gauge and the temperature controller. The extraction time was tracked
after the interior temperature of the vessel reached the target level.
After a predetermined treatment time (5–20 min), the vessel
was quickly immersed into an ice bath to stop the extraction. The
mixture in the vessel was paper-filtered and stored at 4 °C for
further analysis.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of SWE.

The mixtures were combined and concentrated under the reduced pressure
via a vacuum rotary evaporator at 65 °C. The mixtures were centrifuged
at 4000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant
was then precipitated by adding four times the volume of 95% alcohol,
where the mixture was left to rest overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate
was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, washed with absolute ethanol,
acetone, and diethyl ether, dissolved in water, and then the procedure
was repeated. The crude polysaccharide was obtained via vacuum freeze-drying.

2.3 UV–Vis Spectrophotometry Determination
The phenol–sulfuric acid method was used to test the polysaccharide
sample, as it is low cost and UV–vis spectrophotometry is easily
available.46,47 Glucose (0.02–0.08 mg/mL)
was used as the reference to obtain a calibration curve. The linear
regression equation was: A488 = 9.6639C + 0.0016 (r = 0.9976), where A488 was the absorbance at 488 nm and C was the concentration of the glucose sample (mg/mL). One
milliliter of the polysaccharide solution (0.20 mg/mL) was mixed thoroughly
with 1 mL of the fresh 5% aqueous solution phenol in a test tube,
then 5 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid (98%) was rapidly added to
the mixture. The samples were vortexed for 30 s, placed in an oil
bath, and then heated for 20 min at 100 °C for color development.
The reference solutions were prepared via the same methods, although
a 1 mL aliquot of the polysaccharide solution replaced the water.
The samples were cooled to room temperature in a water bath, the mixtures
were measured, and the absorbance was recorded at 488 nm on a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Shanghai Yoke instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
China). The total polysaccharide concentration was calculated with
glucose as the standard.

2.4 Single Factor Experiments
The extraction
temperature, solvent/solid ratio, extraction time, and pressure were
the main factors influencing the SWE of the polysaccharides. During
the single factor experiments, one factor was changed while the other
factors were kept constant in each experiment, and all the experiments
were repeated three times.

2.5 Experimental Design of RSM
2.5.1 Optimization of Process Parameters
The conditions for the SWE of the polysaccharides were further optimized
from the D. nobile Lindl. The BBD serves
as the RSM and was employed using a Design-Expert 7.1.6 Trial (State-Ease,
Inc., Minneapolis MN, USA). BBD determined the maximum efficiency
for an experiment involving three factors and three levels, the number
of experiments conducted was less than a central composite design.48 The three independent variables, the extraction
temperature (X1), extraction time (X2), and pressure (X3), were optimized by the BBD in order to obtain the maximum polysaccharide
yield (Y). Each independent variable for X1, X2, and X3 were evaluated at three levels, see Table 1. The experimental
design totaled 15 runs, including the three replicates at the center
point. All experiments were performed at random. The experiments were
performed in duplicates and the average polysaccharide yield was used
as the response.

2.5.2 Statistical Analysis
The BBD experimental
data were analyzed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to
determine the adequacy of the developed model and the statistical
significance of the regression coefficients.49 The second-order polynomial coefficients were calculated and analyzed
using a Design-Expert 7.1.6 Trial (State-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis MN,
USA). Statistical significance was considered at P < 0.05.50

2.6 Modeling of the Extraction Process
The kinetic model enabled the exploration of the SWE process and
predicted the experimental results.51 A
pseudo-first-order kinetic model was employed to fit the experimental
data. The rate constant was defined as the slope of the plot for the
equation of the first-order reaction52,53 1  where C∞ was the equilibrium concentration of the polysaccharide in the solution
(g/L) at infinite time (t = ∞), C was the concentration of the polysaccharide in the solution (g/L)
at time t, kobs was the
rate constant (min–1) of the extraction process,
and a was the constant for the washing step of the polysaccharide
extraction. If the sample was removed after each time interval, the
total volume of solution could change. The maximum yield (Ym) of the given experiments replaced C∞, where eq 1 becomes54,55 2  

Equation 2 was used to fit the experimental data and to obtain Ym and k values.

The stirring extraction, refluxing extraction, ultrasound extraction,
and SWE were used to extract polysaccharides from the D. nobile Lindl. A series of experiments D. nobile Lindl. (particle sizes < 0.45 mm) were
performed. They were prepared by water immersion to obtain a solvent/solid
ratio of 1:25 (g/mL), where eight mixtures were extracted for 5, 10,
30, 50, 70, 110, 150, and 190 min. (1) The D. nobile Lindl. powder was then put in a conical flask with 60 °C water
under magnetic stirring for the stirring reaction. (2) The D. nobile Lindl. powder was loaded in a round-bottom
flask with water, and then heated to 90 °C in an oil bath under
reflux for the refluxing extraction. (3) Ultrasound extraction was
performed by placing the D. nobile Lindl.
powder and water in an ultrasonic cleaner (KQ-300E, Kunshan ultrasonic
instrument Co., Ltd., Kunshan, China) with a frequency of 40 KHz and
a nominal power of 300 W at 60 °C. (4) The D.
nobile Lindl. powder and water were placed in a high-pressure
batch reactor for the SWE (see the section of 2.2). The operating pressure was 1.0 MPa and extraction temperature
was 130 °C. Each sample was paper-filtered, the filtrate was
obtained, and then analyzed.

2.7 Analysis of Molecular Weight and Monosaccharide
Compositions
The molecular weights of the polysaccharides
were determined by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using
previous methodology,56 in combination
with a Agilent 1200 HPLC equipped with a PL aquagel-OH MIXED-H 8 μm
column (300 × 7.5 mm, Polymer Laboratories Ltd.). The detection
was achieved with a Knauer differential refractometer. The column
temperature was maintained at 30 °C. The eluent was 0.02 N NaCl
in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.50), with a flow rate of 0.60
mL/min. The PL pullulan polysaccharide standards (peak average molecular
weights 738, 12 200, 100 000, 1 600 000,
Polymer Laboratories Ltd.) were used to obtain the calibration curve.
The polysaccharide sample was dissolved with 0.02 N NaCl in 5 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.50) with a concentration of 2 mg/mL and filtered
through a 0.45 μm filter membrane prior to analysis. The molecular
weight distribution of the samples was calculated according to the
calibration curve.

The samples were hydrolyzed with 1.0 M H2SO4 at 105 °C for 2.5 h for the monosaccharide
composition analysis. Following hydrolysis, the samples were filtered
and diluted to 50-fold, and then analyzed via high-performance anion-exchange
chromatography (HPAEC) using a Dionex ICS3000 gradient pump, amperometric
detector, AS50 autosampler, a Carbopac PA-20 column (4 × 250
mm, Dionex), and a guard PA-20 column (3 × 30 mm, Dionex). Monosaccharides
were separated in carbonate-free 18 mM NaOH under a N2 atmosphere
with a postcolumn addition of 0.3 M NaOH at a rate of 0.5 mL/min.
The running time was 45 min, followed by 10 min elution with 0.2 M
NaOH to wash the column. An additional 15 min elution was performed
with 18 mM NaOH to re-equilibrate the column. The calibration was
performed with standard solutions of l-rhamnose, l-arabinose, d-glucose, d-xylose, d-mannose, d-galactose, glucuronic acid, and galacturonic acid.

2.8 Antioxidant Activity Assay
2.8.1 Hydroxyl Radical Scavenging Ability
The hydroxyl radical (•OH) scavenging ability of
the purified polysaccharides was measured in accordance with previous
methods.56 Various concentrations (0–2
mg/mL) were incubated with 2 mmol/L FeSO4 (1 mL), 0.1%
H2O2 (1.0 mL), and 1 mL of 6 mmol/L salicylic
acid (dissolved with alcohol) for 30 min at 37 °C. The hydroxyl
radical was detected by monitoring the absorbance at 510 nm. The hydroxyl
radical scavenging effect was calculated as follows: scavenging effect
(%) = [1 – (Abs. of sample – Abs. of control)/Abs. of
blank] × 100%. Salicylic acid was substituted with distilled
water for the control. Ascorbic acid was used as the positive control.
Lentinan extracted from mushroom was used as a comparison of other
polysaccharide extracts.

2.8.2 ABTS Radical Scavenging Activity
The antioxidant activity was determined via 2,2′-azinobis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid]-diammonium salt (ABTS) radical cations as reported by Fan et
al.,57 with some modifications. The ABTS
radical cation was produced by reacting 5 mL of 7 mmol/L ABTS diammonium
salt with 0.088 mL of 140 mmol/L potassium persulfate. The mixture
was placed in the dark for 24 h. When ready for use, the ABTS solution
was diluted with distilled water to an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02
at 734 nm. Each sample (0.2 mL) with various concentrations (0.0625–2
mg/mL) was added to 3 mL of the diluted ABTS solution and mixed vigorously.
The reaction mixture was allowed to stand at 25 °C for 60 min.
The absorbance at 734 nm was quickly recorded. The ABTS scavenging
effect was calculated as follows: effect (%) = [1 – (Abs. of
sample – Abs. of control)/Abs. of blank] × 100%. Ascorbic
acid was used as the positive control. Distilled water was substituted
for the ABTS-diluted solution for the control. Distilled water was
used instead of the sample for the blank. Lentinan extracted from
mushroom was used as a comparison of other polysaccharide extracts.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Single Factor Experimental Analysis
Effects of extraction temperature (°C), solvent/solid ratio
(mL/g), extraction time (min), and extraction pressure (MPa) on polysaccharide
yield (%) are shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2A, extractions are carried over varied intervals from 100 to 180
°C, while other extraction variables are set as follows: solvent/solid
ratio at 15:1 (mL/g), extraction time at 12.5 min, and extraction
pressure at 0.5 MPa. Results demonstrate that the maximum polysaccharide
yield (9.63%) was obtained at 140 °C, from which point the yield
began to decrease because of the partial degradation of polysaccharides.
It is also observed in the SWE of other natural product.58,59 The effect of the solvent/solid ratio on the polysaccharide yield
was explored from 15:1 to 55:1 (mL/g) with an extraction temperature
of 140 °C, extraction time at 12.5 min, and extraction pressure
at 0.5 MPa. As shown in Figure 2B, the increased solvent/solid ratio had no obvious effect
on polysaccharides yield. This indicates that solvent/solid ratio
at 25:1 (mL/g) is sufficient to obtain high polysaccharides yield.
Thus, the solvent/solid ratio was not a variable tested in future
experiments. It is known that a short extraction time is beneficial
to reduce the costs for industrial applications. As shown in Figure 2C, the maximum polysaccharide
yield was obtained at 11.80% during a 12.5 min extraction interval,
from which point the yield began to increase slightly. This might
be explained by the research that active component yields will not
continue to increase once equilibrium is reached.60 Hence, 12.5 min was a suitable time for the extraction
of polysaccharides from D. nobile Lindl.
As detailed in Figure 2D (all other conditions fixed as described above), polysaccharide
yields increased with increasing extraction pressure to 1.0 MPa, reaching
their maximum yields (20.11%) when the temperature was 140 °C,
solvent/solid ratio was 25:1 (mL/g), and time was 12.5 min. Yield
of polysaccharides dropped when the pressure was more than 1.5 MPa,
it may due to the destruction of the cellular structures of D. nobile Lindl. by heat and pressure and some dissolution
of unfavorable ingredients.61 Thus, extraction
pressure of 1.0 MPa was applicable. According to the results of a
single-factor study, an extraction temperature of 120–160 °C,
under an extraction time of 5–20 min, and an extraction pressure
of 0.5–1.5 MPa were adopted for RSM experiments.

time; and (D) extraction pressure). Values are means ± SD, n = 3.

3.2 Optimization of SWE Conditions
3.2.1 Box–Behnken Design
The Box–Behnken
statistical design with 3 factors (temperature, time, and pressure),
over 3 levels and 15 runs, was selected for the optimization test.
The observed responses (polysaccharide yield) are given in Table 1. The batch runs were
performed with the BBD-designed experimental conditions, to visualize
the effects that the independent factors had on the responses and
on the results, for each experimental condition.62 As the extraction temperature increased, the time and the
pressure enhanced the polysaccharide yield. The results showed a wide
range of differences between the polysaccharide yield. The maximum
polysaccharide yield of 20.3% was achieved at 140 °C, for 12.5
min, and with 1.0 MPa (under conditions of run 15). The response given
in Table 1 correlated
to the three independent variables using a polynomial equation. The
least squares regression was used to fit the data to eq 3. The best fit models in the coded
factors were follows63 3  where Y represented the multiple
response, A was the temperature, B was the time, and C was the pressure.

The
three-dimensional response surfaces were constructed from the BBD
data. Figure 3 shows
the interactions between the two variables by maintaining the third
variable at level zero. The three-dimensional plots provided a visual
interpretation of the interaction between two variables and facilitated
the quantification of the optimum experimental conditions.64 As seen in Figure 3a,c, the extraction temperature exhibited
an important effect on the polysaccharide yield. The polysaccharide
yield increased as the temperature increased to nearly 130 °C
but as the temperature rose further, there was a gradual decrease
in the polysaccharide yield because high temperature affected the
polarity of subcritical water. This affected the solubility of the
polysaccharides, which could result in the destruction of the polysaccharide’s
structure and lead to degradation.42 Morales
et al. also noticed the degradation of polysaccharides obtained from
mushrooms.65 This indicated that temperature
plays an important role in the SWE extraction of polysaccharide. The
effect that the extraction time had on the polysaccharide yield is
presented in Figure 3a,b. The extraction yield increased when the time increased from
5 to 16.71 min, although increasing the time further only increased
the extraction yield slightly. Extraction time did not demonstrate
a significant effect on the polysaccharide yield. Figure 3b,c shows that the polysaccharide
yield increased as the extraction pressure increased to the optimum
level (1.12 MPa), and then decreased as the factor increased further.
The higher pressure more easily destroyed the plant cell wall, which
would increase the diffusion of the polysaccharides, although a much
higher pressure caused the material to become too compact and the
material in the middle of the vessel could not be in full contact
with the water, thus decreasing the extraction yield.42

Figure 3 Response surfaces obtained from the BBD to the (a) temperature
and time; (b) time and pressure; and (c) temperature and pressure.

The optimum conditions obtained by the BBD were as follows: temperature
= 129.83 °C, time = 16.71 min, and pressure = 1.12 MPa. The maximum
predicted that the polysaccharide yield was 20.67%, which corresponded
fairly well to the real extraction yield (21.88%). This result indicated
that the developed mathematical model was both accurate and adequate
for predicting the polysaccharide extraction yield.

3.2.2 Analysis of Variance
The ANOVA
test results are presented in Table 2. The model was determined to be adequate. The model F value of 46.83 demonstrated that the model was significant.
There was a 0.03% chance that this large of a model F value could be due to noise. The values of “Prob > F” less than 0.0500 (0.0003) indicated that the model
terms were significant. The model’s determination coefficient R2 was 0.9883, suggesting that 98.83% of the
variability in the response was explained by the model. The lack of
fit (2.89) was not significant because the P-value
was greater than 0.0500 (0.2673).66 The P-value was used as a tool to confirm the significance of
each coefficient, which could indicate the pattern of the interaction
between the variables.64 The smaller the P-value was, the more significant the corresponding coefficient
was. X1, X3, X2X3, and X32 were significant (P < 0.05), while X2, X1X2, X1X3, X12, and X22 were
not significant (P > 0.05). The model obtained fit
well with the BBD data.

3.3 Extraction with Different Methods
Figure 4 shows the
extraction time-dependent yield data (a) and the  data (b) of the D. nobile Lindl. polysaccharide over the stirring extraction, the refluxing
extraction, the ultrasound extraction, and the SWE methods. As shown
in Figure 4a, the polysaccharide
yields rose observably as the extraction time increased from 5 to
30 min, although the yields did not have a clear change at 50 min.
This was most likely due to the attainment of dynamic equilibrium
between the internal and external particles during the period between
50 and 190 min. The extraction time at their maximum polysaccharide
yields were approximately the same (50 min), although the polysaccharide
yields were different. The polysaccharide yields decreased in the
following order: SWE > ultrasonic extraction > refluxing extraction
> stirring extraction. The corresponding polysaccharide yield at 190
min was 23.42, 19.72, 17.54, and 15.93%. The results indicated that
the polysaccharide did not reach sufficient extraction levels via
the latter three methods. The plot for eq 2 is presented in Figure 4b, where Table 3 provides the experimental estimate for the k-value of the kinetic parameters, which was highest for
SWE, followed by ultrasound extraction and refluxing extraction, and
the stirring extraction had the lowest yield. The results confirmed
that the SWE at a certain pressure and temperature could change the
water density, thus improving the solvency of the water and gaining
additional water-soluble organic compounds.42 The SWE of the D. nobile Lindl. polysaccharide
was highly effective. The R2 value in Table 3 suggests that the
model correlated well with all of the experimental data, indicating
that the model was appropriate for the analysis of extraction processes
on natural extracts.

3.4 Molecular Weight and Monosaccharide Composition
of Polysaccharides
The average molecular weights of the D. nobile Lindl. polysaccharides obtained via different
extraction methods were calculated at 117.09, 86.72, 103.46, and 85.72
kDa, and the chromatograms are shown in Figure S1 (see Supporting Information). The polysaccharides
had no absorbance at 280 nm, suggesting that these polysaccharides
did not contain protein. As seen in Table 4, the polysaccharides extracted via the SWE
have the lowest Mw 85.72 × 103. This demonstrated that the polysaccharides from the SWE
had the highest antioxidant activity. Zha et al. indicated that higher
antioxidant activities of polysaccharides are found as the molecular
weight decreases.67 The polysaccharide
that was extracted via SWE had the lowest Mw/Mn value (60.37), indicating that the
polysaccharide had a relatively low index of polydispersity and a
relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. The molecular weight
changes could due to the hot compressed water extraction.

glucose (%)	54.28	46.98	54.84	48.63	
mannose (%)	43.25	48.76	42.7	48.73	
HPAEC analysis of the monosaccharide composition demonstrated that
the polysaccharide that was extracted by the SWE was composed of l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-glucose, and d-mannose with a 1.05:1.6:48.63:48.73 ratio. Figure S2 (see Supporting Information) and Table 4 show that the monosaccharide
composition of the D. nobile Lindl.
polysaccharide obtained via various extraction methods were similar.

3.5 Antioxidant Activity Results
3.5.1 Scavenging Effect on the Hydroxyl Radical
The hydroxyl radical is the most active of the oxygen radicals,
where it induces severe damage to the adjacent biomolecules.68 As seen in Figure 5a, the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity
of the polysaccharide is measured at various concentrations (0.25–5
mg/mL), with ascorbic acid as the positive control. These results
suggested that the polysaccharide activity gradually rose as the concentrations
increased. The ascorbic acid showed an excellent scavenging effect
within 0.25–5 mg/mL. The polysaccharide and lentinan extracted
from mushroom both exhibited high scavenging effects on the hydroxyl
radical. The effect obtained 96.98 and 92.70% at 5 mg/mL, respectively,
which was close to the ascorbic acid (99.74%). The results indicated
that the D. nobile Lindl. polysaccharide
displayed a strong scavenging power for the hydroxyl radical.

Figure 5 Scavenging effect of polysaccharide, ascorbic acid, and lentinan
on hydroxyl radical (a) and ABTS radical (b). Values are means ±
SD, n = 3.

3.5.2 Scavenging Effect on ABTS Radical
The ABTS assay is often used when evaluating the total antioxidant
power of single compounds and complex mixtures of natural products.69 As Figure 5b shows, the polysaccharide, ascorbic acid, and lentinan
extracted from mushroom demonstrated dose-dependent activities. The
rate of polysaccharides, ascorbic acid, and lentinan scavenged ABTS
radicals was 84.76, 98.85, and 63.96% at 5 mg/mL, respectively. The
ABTS radical scavenging activity of the polysaccharide was inferior
than the ascorbic acid but superior than lentinan. These results suggested
that polysaccharide from different natural sources showed different
radical scavenging abilities. In a word, the D. nobile Lindl. polysaccharide could be explored as novel potential antioxidants
because of the remarkable antioxidant activity with a scavenging range
between 28.66 and 84.76%.

4 Conclusions
SWE is a green process that was demonstrated to be an excellent
method for D. nobile Lindl polysaccharide
extraction. Single factor experiments and BBD of RSM were used to
identify the optimal experimental conditions to be a time and pressure
of 129.83 °C, 16.71 min, and 1.12 MPa. The maximal polysaccharide
yield reached 21.88%. The polysaccharide was quantitatively determined
via UV–vis spectrophotometry, where the results were compared
with polysaccharides obtained by other methods (stirring extraction,
refluxing extraction, ultrasound extraction, and SWE methods). The
extraction processes were modeled and analyzed. The model had a good
correlation between the experimental data and was determined to be
fit for the comparison of the polysaccharide extraction. The polysaccharide
extracted via SWE was composed of l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-glucose, and d-mannose at a 1.05:1.6:48.63:48.73
ratio. The average molecular weight was 85.72 kDa. The antioxidant
activity assay demonstrated that the SWE had little effect on the
medicinal properties of the polysaccharide. The rate of polysaccharide
scavenging of hydroxyl radicals and the ABTS radical at 5.00 mg/mL
were 96.98 and 84.76%. These results demonstrated that the SWE was
an efficient and quick method for extracting polysaccharides and has
potential as a useful technique for extracting other natural extracts.
