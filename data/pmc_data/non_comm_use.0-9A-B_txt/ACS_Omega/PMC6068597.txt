Two-dimensional
gallium sulfide (GaS) crystals are synthesized
by a simple and efficient ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) method using a single-source precursor of Ga2S3. The synthesized GaS structures involve triangular monolayer
domains and multilayer flakes with thickness of 1 and 15 nm, respectively.
Regions of continuous films of GaS are also achieved with about 0.7
cm2 uniform coverage. This is achieved by using hydrogen
carrier gas and the horizontally placed SiO2/Si substrates.
Electron microscopy and spectroscopic measurements are used to characteristic
the CVD-grown materials. This provides important insights into novel
approaches for enlarging the domain size of GaS crystals and understanding
of the growth mechanism using this precursor system.

Introduction
Monolayer
and continuous two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted great interest because of their
unique physical properties and promising future applications.1−8 The intensively studied TMDs, such as MoS2 and WS2, have dichalcogenide form of MX2; similarly, the
post-transition metals of group III and VI elements have the form
of MX where M = Ga, In and X = S, Se with monochalcogenide form.9−14 Two bonded gallium metal atoms are between two layers of sulfur
atoms, like a sandwich. The unit cell of gallium sulfide (GaS) is
hexagonal crystal structure with a = b = 3.587 Å, c = 15.492 Å, where c is equal to two layers of GaS.15 The indirect band gap of 2D GaS is about 3.05 eV which lies between
the semimetal graphene and insulating hexagonal boron nitride.16−20 Because of the strong surface effects, the first-principle calculated
band gap of GaS nanosheets varies from 2.59 to 1.6 eV, when the number
of layers is increased from monolayer to bulk, which makes it a promising
material for applications in electronics and opto-electronics.21,22 Also, 2D GaS has been explored for applications in transistors,
photodetectors, energy storage, gas sensing, and application as hydrogen
evolution catalysts.14,17,22−24

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been one
of the most promising
methods of producing large-area and high-quality 2D materials, as
well as for the synthesis of 2D GaS materials.25−31 Other synthesis methods include mechanical exfoliation, chemically
assisted exfoliation, atomic layer deposition, and screen printing
deposition methods. Barron et al. demonstrated CVD-synthesized polycrystalline
gallium sulfide thin films using a predesigned single-source precursor
of gallium chalcogenide cubane [(t-Bu)GaS]4 in 1992.32 Zhou et al. synthesized various
morphologies of GaS such as nanowires, nanobelts, and hexagonal microplates
using mixtures of GaN and Bi2S3 precursors,
and the reaction took place at 1170 °C using a vapor–solid
method.33 Kang et al. reported GaS1–xSex alloy
multilayers and monolayers synthesized on a SiO2/Si substrate
(with 1 nm thick Au deposited film) at 950 °C using Ga2S3 and Ga2Se3 as precursors by the
chemical vapor transport method.34

Dravid et al. mechanically exfoliated a single layer of GaS at
room temperature under ambient conditions from a bulk material onto
a SiO2/Si substrate, and the typical flakes had dimensions
of tens of micrometers.19 Colmen et al.
demonstrated the large quantities production of GaS via liquid exfoliation
with lateral sizes and thicknesses of 50–1000 nm and 3–80
layers, respectively.24 Meng et al. synthesized
the amorphous and smooth gallium sulfide material via atomic layer
deposition method using hexakis digallium and hydrogen sulfide as
precursors in the temperature range of 125–225 °C.35 Recently, Kalantar-Zadeh et al. developed a
screen printing method for the deposition of bilayer 2D GaS thin films,
which utilized an atomically thin oxide layer and further sulfurization
process to replace the oxygen atoms with sulfur atoms.18 The controllable production of continuous, large-scale,
high-quality GaS films still remains a challenge, and further research
is needed to improve the material quality and uniformity of the samples.

In this work, we develop a method for the growth of 2D GaS on SiO2/Si substrates using the ambient pressure CVD method. The
growth process of GaS includes the evaporation and reduction of Ga2S3 precursor and using hydrogen carrier gas. Both
monolayer and continuous GaS film are achieved by controlling the
growth temperature, substrate position, and the carrier gas flow rate.
The CVD-grown GaS is characterized by optical microscopy, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence
(PL) and Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM).

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
a schematic illustration of the CVD method to grow GaS on SiO2/Si substrates. The chemical reaction takes place inside a
1 in. diameter quartz tube under ambient pressure. The Ga2S3 precursor is placed at the center of the growth furnace.
The 2 cm by 2 cm substrate is placed at the downstream of the growth
furnace with a distance of 8.5 cm. Figure 1b represents the profiles of temperature
against time employed for the growth of GaS and includes three stages.
The whole system is flushed with 500 sccm argon gas for 30 min. After
that, the temperature of the precursor was increased from room temperature
to 800 °C with a mixture of 70 sccm of hydrogen gas and 150 sccm
of argon gas. The reaction is conducted once the temperature is reached
for a short period of time with only 70 sccm hydrogen gas flow. At
last, fast cooling process is applied with only 150 sccm argon gas
flow. By optimizing the reaction parameters, such as the growth time,
growth temperature, the amounts of precursors, the positions of the
substrate, and the amount of hydrogen gas flow rate, we are able to
produce the monocrystalline GaS domains or large-area continuous polycrystalline
GaS film and even control the chemical composition between the gallium
and sulfur. Two modifications are made in stage II. The first modification
involves placing the substrate horizontally which creates a precursor
concentration gradient and an inhomogeneity of the precursor feed-stock
on the substrate surface. The other modification involves increasing
the hydrogen gas flow rate during the growth stage and tuning the
Ga2S3 decomposition (the compared SEM images
are in the Supporting Information). Figure 1c shows the deposition
pattern of after CVD growth of 2D GaS on SiO2/Si substrate
and this formation of U-shaped pattern is because of the variation
of Ga2S3 vapor concentration gradient. This
U-shaped pattern is observed in the CVD growth of other 2D TMD growth
such as WS2 and MoS2.25,26Figure 1d,e are two
zoomed-in optical images of selective regions in Figure 1c; both show the multilayer
GaS flakes stacked area and individual triangle-shaped GaS domains
with the size of 4 μm, respectively.

Several stages are observed during
the GaS layered growth. To study
the morphology of the CVD-grown gallium sulphide 2D materials, SEM
is used to examine the SiO2/Si substrate area by area. Figure 2a presents a schematic
illustration of six selected regions which are numbers labeled, where
the SEM images are taken. These six regions clearly reveal the dependence
of the shape change on the distance from the Ga2S3 precursor vapor concentration. Figure 2 with position 1 shows the morphology of
the center and upstream region where multilayer gallium sulfide flakes
are formed. Toward the edge of the substrate at positions 2, 3, 4,
isolated triangle GaS domains with the size ranging from about 8 and
2 μm are observed. Positions 4-1 to 4-3 represent the growth
morphology of position 4 with more details. Furthermore, at position
4-1, the transition between individual domain and continuous film
of GaS is found, half of the region shows complete continuous film
and the other half region shows the triangular domains with various
sizes. Toward the center of the substrate, a uniform continuous film
of GaS is observed, formed by the merger of GaS domains and the size
of GaS triangular domains increase from 2 to 6 μm, as shown
in 4-2, and 4-3 SEM images, respectively. At the downstream region
of the substrate, there is a change in the size of GaS domains. At
positions 5 and 6, the GaS domain size is reduced to less than 2 μm
and rounded nucleation sites are observed, and eventually the size
is too small to identify its shape at the end. It can be seen that,
with the increase in the distance between the precursor and the growth
locations, GaS domains experience a regular morphology transformation
as well as size and shape changes.

GaS on SiO2/Si substrates. (a) Schematic of the U-shaped
region with number
labels. Each number label represents the typical regions and the morphologies
are shown in the corresponding SEM images.

The continuous region of CVD grown 2D GaS is further investigated
because these qualities such as large-area, uniform, and continuous
qualities are vital for future applications. Figure 3a shows the SEM image of a large continuous
GaS region on a SiO2/Si substrate, with the left corner
having partially covered regions where the triangle GaS domains are.
While complete continuous film coverage of GaS is shown in Figure 3b with the size of
700 μm. It is observed that the large white particles are first
deposited onto the SiO2/Si substrate and then gradually
enclosed regions. Next, small triangular domains are nucleated at
preferred locations, such as substrates’ edges, scratches,
dust particles or rough surfaces.36 More
SEM images are shown in the Supporting Information. Then, the nucleation sites continued to grow and formed boundaries
when two or more layered 2D GaS meet, resulting in a partially continuous
film. This process eventually leads to domains being coalesced and
merged into large-area single-layered GaS continuous film, if sufficient
precursor supply and denser nucleation sites are provided. A further
zoomed-in SEM image of the GaS film is shown in Figure 3c, and the small dark regions on the continuous
films are secondary layers which are formed during CVD growth.

of monolayer GaS films. (a) SEM image of large-area
monolayer GaS film with initial nucleation sites. (b) SEM image of

GaS film with second layer nucleation sites.

The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, AFM, Raman
spectroscopy,
PL spectroscopy, and TEM are all used to evaluate the CVD-grown GaS
in terms of chemical compositional analysis, thickness, film quality,
and crystallinity. The typical EDX spot spectra are in Figure 4a,b, where the five spots EDX
results are from GaS flakes and the monolayer GaS film region and
shown in the corresponding inserts, respectively. The intensity of
Ga and S from GaS flakes is significantly strong than the monolayer
GaS. The atomic percentage and ratio of sulfur and gallium elements
are obtained from the EDX. Figure 4c reveals the S/Ga ratio comparison among the CVD-synthesized
GaS flakes, monolayer region, and the Ga2S3 precursor.
The S/Ga ratios of GaS flakes is close to 1 and is consistent to about
1.2 value, whereas the ratio in monolayer GaS has large variation
between 1.9 and 1.4. The ratio of the Ga2S3 precursor
is set to 1.5 as a reference. This might be due to the ultrathin property
of the material, making it difficult to detect subtle variations using
EDX. All this information is summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. In this work, the shape
of CVD-synthesized GaS domain is quite consistent with a truncated
triangle shape. In previous reports, the shape of CVD-grown GaS domains
were hexagonal and sharp triangle shapes, and the hexagon-shaped domain
has three Ga- and S-terminated edges, and the triangle-shaped domain
can only have either S- or Ga-terminated edges.33,34 The exact ratio between Ga and S atoms on the substrate influences
the energetic stability of Ga- and S-terminated edges. Because a single-source
precursor Ga2S3 is used here, and it is reduced
by the hydrogen carrier gas, it means that only slightly excessive
S is present throughout the whole synthesis process. This explains
why the resulted GaS domains are truncated, because of a similar Ga/S
ratio in the precursor. If the stoichiometry was such that S was in
vast excess, we would expect sharp triangular domains. Similar results
are reported in the CVD synthesis of MoS2 and WS2 as well.26

The scale bar is 8 μm. (c) Ratio of sulfur to gallium and five

The roughness and thickness of
the CVD-grown GaS continuous film,
flakes, and domains are characterized by AFM. The AFM measurements
in the topological mode for an almost fully merged region with corresponding
zoomed-in AFM scans, indicated by dashed green and blue boxes, are
shown in Figure 5a–c.
This scanned region is not fully covered on the substrate; it is densely
covered by triangular GaS domains, which are close to coalescing into
a continuous film. Both the merged grain boundaries and the second
nuclei are observed under the AFM measurements and a 0.19 nm root
mean squared (rms) is measured, indicated by the green box, shown
in Figure 5c. The corresponding
height profile of the GaS continuous film is measured in Figure 5d and the 1 nm thickness
is in agreement with the GaS monolayer flakes on SiO2/Si
substrate.19 The GaS flakes are also measured
along the black line indicated in Figure 5e and the corresponding height profile results
in two steps with 25 and 10 nm thickness of the GaS flakes, as shown
in Figure 5f. The individual
triangular GaS domain has about 0.6 nm step height, although the measured
rms on the after CVD-grown SiO2/Si substrate is 0.48 nm
on the same scan; both are shown in Figure 5g,h, respectively. The rms on the triangle
GaS domains closely match the monolayer film, with both measured to
have values of ∼0.16 nm.

region with different
magnifications. The zoomed-in regions are labeled in green and blue
dashed boxes. The highlighted green color region has an rms of 0.19
nm. (d) Height profile of a continuous GaS film measured across the

height profile of selected GaS flakes measured across the black line

nm on the SiO2/Si substrate, the boxes 2 and 3 have the
same rms of 0.16 nm on the GaS domains. (h) Corresponding height profile
of the GaS domain measured across the black line in (g).

The as-grown GaS flakes and monolayer domains are
further investigated
using Raman spectroscopy with a 532 nm excitation to determine the
layer number and quality. GaS has three first-order phonon modes in
Raman spectroscopy, two out-of-plane A1g1 and A1g2 modes, and one in-plane E2g1 mode. Raman spectra are taken
from spot positions on both GaS flakes and domains, as shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively.
The GaS flakes show Raman peaks for modes A1g1 (188 cm–1), A1g2 (360 cm–1) and E2g1 (294
cm–1). The full width at half-maximum of A1g1 and A1g2 mode are 5 and
6 cm–1, respectively. However, the GaS monolayer
domain shows A1g1 (179 cm–1), E2g1 (297 cm–1) which is combined
with the 303 cm–1 Raman peak from the SiO2/Si substrate. This results in a broadened peak, and the A1g2 is not shown
on the spectra. As the thickness of GaS decreases from flakes to monolayer
domain, the frequency of the E2g1 mode slightly increased and that of A1g1 mode decreased,
and also, the overall intensities are observed to decrease as well.
These results are in agreement with previous reports.17,19,22,37 The spectroscopy measurements of the GaS flakes with 532 nm excitation
also show a very broad peak between 550 and 800 nm with centered position
at 622 nm. This peak is associated with either indirect transitions
or defects in GaS flakes that produce deep trap recombination states.38 However, the monolayer GaS domain does not show
this peak at all. The 532 nm excitation is not sufficient to excite
the indirect band gap of GaS, and thus, we do not expect to observe
high-efficiency PL from recombination across the indirect gap. These
two strong PL peaks observed in both samples and obtained by 523 nm
excitation is associated with the SiO2/Si substrates.

TEM is used to further characterize the CVD as-grown gallium
sulfide
layered structures after transfer onto TEM grids by a poly(methyl
methacrylate)-assisted wet chemical transfer method. Figure 7a–c shows typical low-magnification
and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of thin layered GaS sheet,
which is on a lacey carbon TEM grid. Figure 7a shows the layered structures at a large
scale. Figure 7b,d
shows HRTEM images, and they reveal the single-crystalline nature
of the CVD-grown GaS flakes. Intensity line profiles are plotted in Figure 7c, and the measured d-spacing between the neighboring (100) planes is 0.31 nm
which is consistent with the values for β-GaS (a = 3.587 Å and c = 15.492 Å).14,33 The inset in (b) shows corresponding fast Fourier-transform
(FFT) power spectrum indicating that GaS sheets are orientated along
at the [0001] zone axis and confirm the hexagonal structure, compared
with previous report.34 Further zoomed-in HRTEM images are shown in Figure 7d, which corresponds to the selected area
in Figure 7b; and the
schematic diagram of the top view of the GaS crystal is presented
in Figure 7e. Both
help to confirm the crystalline quality of CVD-grown GaS materials
and are in good agreement with the mechanical exfoliated prepared
GaS nanoflakes.14

Conclusion
In conclusion, we report a simple CVD approach
for growing both
monolayer and multilayer high-quality GaS films with large domain
size on SiO2/Si substrate using hydrogen carrier gas to
reduce a single-source precursor of Ga2S3 at
atmospheric pressure. The film microstructure, thickness, homogeneity,
and quality are characterized by optical microscopy, SEM with EDX,
Raman spectra, PL spectra, and TEM. These results show how sensitive
the growth of GaS is to minor variations in the CVD parameters and
that drastic improvements can be easily achieved by simple optimizations.
This approach has shown potential in scale-up and meets safety requirements
for large-scale implementation and eventually toward the controllable
number of layers CVD growth of 2D GaS.
