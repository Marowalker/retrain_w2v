The
property of upconverting nanoparticles to convert the low-energy
near-infrared (NIR) light into high-energy visible light has made
them a potential candidate for various biomedical applications including
photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this work, we show how a surface functionalization
approach on the nanoparticle can be used to develop a nanocomposite
hydrogel which can be of potential use for the PDT application. The
upconverting hydrogel nanocomposite was synthesized by reacting 10-undecenoic
acid-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles with the thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide
monomer. The formation of hydrogel was completed within 15 min and
hydrogel nanocomposites showed strong enhancement in the visible light
emission compared to the emission obtained from 10-undecenoic acid-capped
Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles
via the upconversion process (under 980 nm laser excitation). The
upconverting hydrogel nanocomposites displayed high swelling behavior
in water because of their porous nature. The porous structure ensured
a higher loading of methylene blue dye (∼78% in 1 h) into the
upconverting hydrogel, which was achieved via the swelling diffusion
phenomenon. Upon excitation with the NIR light, the visible light
emitted from the hydrogel activated the photosensitizer methylene
blue which generated reactive oxygen species. Our results were able
to show that the methylene blue-loaded composite hydrogel can be a
potential platform for the future of NIR-triggered PDT in skin cancer
treatment.

Introduction
Photodynamic therapy
(PDT) is the technique which is well known
in the diagnosis of dermatosis and even malignant cancer.1−4 This technique uses a suitable source of light and a photosensitizer
(PS) molecule for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which
are responsible for the cell death.5−8 The basic principle of PDT is the activation
of the PS molecule via the light of suitable wavelength. The PS molecule,
in turn, generates the ROS which causes oxidative cell damage to the
particular tissue.9,10 To explain the phenomenon briefly,
first, the PS molecule is administered to the particularly affected
tissue in the absence of light, after which the PS molecule distributes
itself in the particular area. When light is irradiated on the affected
tissue, the PS generates ROS facilitating cell death. In conventional
PDT, the PSs used are predominantly activated by visible light. Visible
light has its own limitation of passing through the thick tissue membrane,
and therefore it is a challenge to minimize the loss of light. The
higher penetration behavior of near-infrared (NIR) light over visible
light into the skin tissue is an advantage for NIR-responsive material
to be applied for PDT as the NIR light-triggered material would give
a higher signal to noise ratio with low autofluorescence.11 To facilitate this technique, a suitable transducer
can be utilized to convert NIR light to visible light. The generated
visible light will effectively activate the PSs which are usually
visible light-responsive materials. For an effective PDT, the PSs
must satisfy two conditions. First, they should be target-specific
to the tissue of interest. Second, they should be able to efficiently
generate the ROS when irradiated with a suitable light source.

The process of conversion of NIR to visible light can be easily
achieved using lanthanide-doped upconverting nanomaterials.12−23 Lanthanide ions (Ln3+) are known to possess the ability
to convert lower energy light into higher energy light via a nonlinear
multiphoton process called anti-Stokes process. In addition, these
nanoparticles (NPs) are an interesting luminescent probe because of
their properties such as nonblinking emission, excellent photostability,
low autofluorescence background, and deep tissue penetration of light
into biological systems with comparatively lower toxicity and higher
luminescence lifetime enabling longer particle tracking.24−31 Thus, upconverting NPs are an interesting choice for applications
in biomedical areas, especially as a nanotransducer. It helps to overcome
the problems that traditional photodyanamic therapy has been facing
so far.32,33 The visible light emitted by the excitation
of NIR light is able to trigger the PS dye molecule via resonance
energy transfer to generate singlet oxygen species if the absorption
window of PS matches with the emission window of upconverting NPs.
Thus, NIR light-stimulated upconverting NPs potentially open new doors
to PDT. In principle, the PSs should be in the vicinity of the upconverting
NPs for efficient energy transfer. Ideally, higher the overlap between
the absorption of the PS and the emission from the upconverting NP,
the higher will be the efficiency of singlet (1O2) generation.

There are quite a few reports where various PS
molecules are loaded
into silica, polymer-coated and core/shell upconverting NPs.34−44 However, the number of PS molecules attached to these coated NPs
is quite low because of less porosity. For example, Xu et al. have
shown that 29% of PS loading is achieved for the core/shell dumbbell-like
NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaNdF4:Yb3+ NPs.45 In the case of
polymer-coated NPs, 22.5% of PS loading is observed.46 In another study, the loading capacity of PS for silica-coated
NaYF4:Er/Yb/Gd NPs was experimentally calculated to be
0.05 mmol methylene blue (MB)/UCNP.47 Recently
Huang et al. have shown the combined photothermal and photodynamic
effect by integrating silica NPs with upconverting NPs and gold nanorods.48 They have used zinc phthalocyanine as sensitizers.
Although, the PS loading was very high. Moreover, PS may not be stable
on the NP surface because of weak interactions and can be isolated
from the NPs quickly, thus reducing the PDT efficiency. One way to
circumvent this issue is to use hydrogels as a platform to study the
PDT. Hydrogel-based materials have been shown as a potential drug-delivery
candidate because of their stimuli-responsive nature and porous structure.
The shape and behavior of the porous patterns can be tuned in such
a way that it can store multiple numbers of drugs selectively. The
ROS generated by the PS molecule can be easily released out of the
porous hydrogel system as opposed to dense silica and polymer coating.49−51 Keeping these in mind, attaching an upconverting nanomaterial with
a suitable hydrogel can be really advantageous to use it as an effective
PDT tool. The PS molecules can be easily adsorbed onto the NPs via
the swelling diffusion technique. This places the upconverting NPs
and PS molecules close to each other for the effective production
of 1O2. Recently, our group has synthesized
upconverting hydrogel nanocomposites using a simple thiol–ene
click reaction and used them as a template for the synthesis of dendrimer-like
Au nanostructures.52

In this work,
we have synthesized Ln3+-doped upconverting
hydrogel nanocomposite and evaluated its potential for photodynamic
therapy. The nanocomposite was prepared by first synthesizing the
10-undecenoic acid (10-UDA)-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs via a microwave procedure. The carboxylic
group at one terminal attaches to the NP surface, whereas the double
bond present at the surface of the NPs is used to react with monomer N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and cross-linker methylene
bisacrylamide (MBA) with azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as a thermal
initiator to form a hydrogel composite. The hydrogel nanocomposites
displayed strong NIR-to-visible (500–700 nm) upconversion emission
under the excitation from the 980 nm laser. The emission near 650
nm was used to activate the MB for the generation of singlet oxygen,
as its absorption maxima match well with the 650 nm emission of the
upconverting NPs. The MB molecules were easily loaded onto the upconverting
hydrogel nanocomposites because of the highly porous nature, and a
high swelling ratio of composite gels in water was observed. These
hydrogel nanocomposites can reduce the distance between MB and upconverting
NPs as well as effectively protect the MB dye from the denaturation
instigated by the extreme environment. The results suggest that the
(NIPAM-MBA@UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB
hydrogel nanocomposite can be used as carriers for PS methylene blue
dye in the PDT.

Results and Discussions
The upconverting
NPs were synthesized using the microwave irradiation-assisted
technique. The phase purity and crystallinity of the NPs were analyzed
by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses. Figure 1a shows the PXRD pattern of
the 10-UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs. From the figure, it is clear that the NPs formed are cubic
phase (α) NaYF4 (JCPDF 06-0432) as the peak positions
and intensities of the NPs matched well to the standard of bulk. The
PXRD peaks clearly suggested the formation of the highly crystalline
nature of the NPs synthesized. The size and morphology analysis was
performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Figure 1b. The TEM image
of the 10-UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs shows that the particles were aggregated with a distorted
spherical nature. The average size of the NPs was close to 20 nm. The
high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image confirms the highly crystalline
nature of the synthesized NPs with an interplaner distance of 0.326
nm corresponding to the (111) plane and 0.199 nm corresponding to
the (220) plane of α-phase NaYF4 NPs, as shown in Figure S1a. The selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern also confirms the presence of major peaks present in
the crystalline cubic phase of NaYF4 NP. The SAED pattern
of the NPs is shown in Figure S1b. We believe
that the aggregation of the NPs is due to the weak interaction between
the double bonds of the neighboring NPs (vide infra). The NPs were
highly dispersible in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) which is a polar organic
solvent. The high dispersibility of the NPs in DMSO suggests the strong
attachment of 10-UDA to the surface of the NPs.

(b) TEM image of 10-undecenoic acid (10-UDA)-capped
Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs. The vertical
lines in (a) are the standard pattern of cubic phase bulk NaYF4.

The elemental composition was
confirmed from elemental mapping
followed by line scanning which confirmed the presence of sodium,
yttrium, ytterbium, erbium, and fluoride atoms as shown in Figures S2 and S3. Also, the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum showed the presence of the abovementioned
elements (see Figure S4).

The surface
functionalization of the NPs with 10-UDA molecules
was determined by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra
of pure 10-UDA and 10-UDA-capped NPs. The peak observed near 1712
cm–1 corresponds to C=O stretching vibration
of the COOH group present in pure 10-UDA. The C=O stretching
vibration is shifted to 1640 cm–1 with reduced peak
intensity upon binding to the NP surface. The sharp bands appearing
near 2855 and 2930 cm–1 are due to the symmetric
and asymmetric CH2 stretching vibration modes, respectively,
in 10-UDA, which are also observed for the 10-UDA-capped NPs. Another
small peak is observed at 3080 cm–1 belonging to
the C–H stretching of the HC=CH2 group, which
is present in both pure 10-UDA as well as in 10-UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs. We tried to
get more details regarding the aggregation of NPs observed in the
TEM image from the FTIR results, as it will be more sensitive to changes
in the C=C–H vibrational frequencies. Because of the
overlap of the −C=C–H stretching frequency (∼1640
cm–1) with the carbonyl stretching frequency of
−COO– groups in the NPs, we tried to compare
the −C=C–H bending vibration at 910 cm–1. Though there is only a slight shift toward higher energy, the peak
broadening is quite different. The full width at half-maximum (fwhm)
of the peak shifts from 25.57 to 15.81 for the NP (see inset of Figure 2). This may be likely
due to interactions between the double bonds resulting in longer relaxation
time for the bending vibration.

10-UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs. The inset shows the
expanded view of the C=C–H bending region along with
fwhm of the corresponding peaks.

The UC NPs are known for their characteristic optical pattern
of
showing the anti-Stokes emission by converting low-energy photons
into high-energy photons (in this case, Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs can convert NIR light of 980 nm into
visible light in the green and red region). The luminescence behavior
of the UC NPs was studied using a 980 nm diode laser. Figure 3 shows the upconversion emission
spectrum of the UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs in DMSO for 0.1% (wt/vol) of NP dispersion. Upon 980
nm excitation, the Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs display three emission bands centered at 521, 540, and
650 nm. These emission bands are respectively assigned to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions
of the excited Er3+ ions. The upconversion emission spectrum
observed is due to two-photon energy transfer from excited Yb3+ ions to the Er3+ ions. Yb3+ ions have
a high absorption coefficient around 980 nm, it acts as a sensitizer
for the Er3+ ions which are the activator ions. The upconversion
mechanism is similar to the previously reported mechanism.53−55

The UC NPs were transferred into gel-based composites for
them
to be used in PDT. Our idea was to use the UC NPs in the hydrogel
form for efficient PDT. For this purpose, the UC NPs were incorporated
into a gel-based matrix as a nanocomposite. The double bond present
at the surface of the NPs were utilized in the synthesis of nanocomposite
gels. 10-UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs were converted into a gel form by the addition of NIPAM
and N,N-methylenebis(acrylamide)
(MBA) solutions in the presence of thermal radical initiator AIBN.
NIPAM and MBA are the monomer and cross-linking agent, respectively.
These molecules have the ability to form cross-linked networks with
the double bond moiety present on the surface of the Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs. The gel formation was
completed within 15 min with continuous stirring at 70 °C under
an Ar atmosphere. After 15 min, the synthesized gel was sticking to
the bottom of the reaction flask. Also, the rotation of the magnetic
stirrer was reduced which was proof that the gelation has occurred.
The purification of the gel was performed by washing the gel with
DMSO for 5 times. Scheme 1 shows the schematic representation of the synthesis of NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ gel and the inset shows the
digital image of the gel formed inside the cuvette.

The
inset shows the upconverting
gel in the cuvette.

The phase of the NPs after
gel formation was confirmed by the PXRD
analysis. The PXRD pattern of NPs after gel formation is shown in Figure S5. The X-ray diffraction pattern matches
well with the UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs confirming that the phase of the NPs is well preserved
and not affected after gel formation. To understand the morphology
of the resulting nanocomposite gels, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis was performed. The 10-UDA-capped NPs after gel formation
resulted in nonporous fiber-like architecture. Figure 4 shows the SEM images of the resulting (NIPAM-MBA-10-UDA@NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) gel.

Figure 4 SEM images of the upconverting
nanocomposite gel (NIPAM-MBA@UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+).

The nanocomposite gel
was further characterized with FTIR analysis. Figure S6 shows the FTIR spectrum of Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 composite gel. The C–H
stretching of the HC=CH2 group, which appeared at
3080 cm–1 for the UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs, is absent in the spectrum of
the composite gel. It suggests that the NPs are covalently bound to
the NIPAM and MBA. A distinct carbonyl stretching signal observed
at 1648 cm–1 confirms the presence of C=O
stretching of the −CONH–group in the gel.

The
structure and crystalline behavior of the formed hydrogel were
confirmed using TEM, HRTEM, and SAED patterns as shown in Figures S7 and S8. The nanocomposite has irregular
morphology as was the case of 10-UDA-capped NPs. In case of hydrogel,
it is confirmed that the NPs are closely spaced from each other because
of the hydrogel formed surrounding it. The interplaner spacing of
0.332 nm corresponding to the (111) plane is the same as cubic-phased
NaYF4 NP which again confirms the presence of NPs inside
the hydrogel. The SAED pattern also shows the formation of two concentric
rings only corresponding to the highest intensity peaks present in
cubic-phase NaYF4 NPs. The elemental composition has been
confirmed by mapping and line scanning as shown in Figures S9 and S10.

The luminescence behavior of the
upconverting composite gel of
the Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs was
retained even after gel formation. Figure 5 shows the upconversion luminescence spectra
of NPs before and after gel formation. Interestingly, the UC emission
spectra clearly show that the intensity of upconversion luminescence
for gel composites increased upto 4 times compared to UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs. In order to
confirm the increase in emission of the Er3+ ion, lifetime
decay analysis was carried out using direct excitation at 485 nm observing
both the 540 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 650 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2). As shown in Figures S11 and S12, the lifetime of the 540 nm emission increased
to 202.2 μs from 141.62 μs, whereas the values of the
red emission increased to 157.15 from 140.18 μs upon gel formation.
This is clearly in accordance with the enhancement of emission intensity
of the hydrogel sample as compared to 10-UDA-capped NaYF4 NPs. We presume that this may be due to reduction in the defects
at the surface or less quenching from the solvent, thereby reducing
the rate of nonradiative decay. This results in the increase in the
intensity of the Er3+ emissions.

Figure 5 Upconversion emission
spectra of (a) UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs and (b) after gel formation
(both measured in solid state under identical conditions).

We noted that the gel nanocomposite was barely
dispersible in any
nonpolar or aprotic solvent. We believe that because of the cross-linking
network of the UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs with NIPAM and MBA, the dispersibility of the composite
gels was very low in nonpolar and aprotic polar solvents. The above
results evidently indicated the formation of the composite gels.

The swelling behavior of the upconverting nanocomposite gel was
studied by carrying out swelling measurements on the resulting nonporous
composite gels in polar and nonpolar solvents such as water and toluene,
respectively. Figure 6 shows the SEM images of the composite gels after being exposed to
water and toluene. The composite gels in water show the aggregation
of fibers with pores in it. The same gel nanocomposite in toluene
shows the presence of fibers without pores, suggesting that the swelling
behavior of gels is achieved in the presence of water. The selective
swelling in water implies that the developed composite gels are hydrogels
which can absorb water because of formation of hydrogen bonding. Nearly
200% (by weight) swelling was observed for composite gels in water
within 1 h duration. The observed swelling behavior was attributed
to the presence of water molecules and several hydrophilic sites in
the nanocomposite gels, allowing electrostatic repulsion due to the
formation hydrogen bonding interaction.

nanocomposite gel in (a) water and (b)
toluene.

To utilize the upconverting hydrogel
nanocomposites for NIR-laser-triggered
PDT, MB was chosen as a model PS because of its high quantum yield
of 1O2 generation (0.5),56 negligible dark toxicity, and its hydrophilic nature. Moreover,
the absorption of methylene blue matches well with the red UC emission
of Er3+ ions. Figure 7 clearly shows the spectral overlap between absorption
(654 nm) of MB and red emission (651 nm) of 10-UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs. This high spectral overlap
suggests possibility of efficient energy transfer between the activator
molecules Er3+ to the PS MB.

and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ emission spectra.

Loading of MB
The hydrophilic nature of the gel along
with its porous nature and large swelling behavior were ideal for
the high loading capacity of MB into the upconverting nanocomposite
gel. The loading of MB onto the NIPAM-MBA@UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ hydrogel was performed by a simple swelling-diffusion
technique. Because of the high swelling ability of the hydrogel nanocomposite
in water, the loading of MB was easy onto the NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ hydrogel. Briefly, 3 mL of
0.01 mM MB was added to a small piece of the (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) hydrogel composite for 1
h at room temperature. Free MB molecules were removed by re-dispersing
the MB-loaded upconverting hydrogel nanocomposite in water for 30
min and removing the supernatant. This procedure was repeated 3 times.
The resulting (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB hydrogel nanocomposite was colored, indicating the successful
loading of MB within the upconverting hydrogel matrix. This was further
confirmed by UV–vis absorption studies. Figure 8 shows UV–vis spectra of MB dye-loaded
nanocomposite gel along with the gel without MB. A strong absorption
peak characteristic of MB is observed near 654 nm for the gel, whereas
barely any absorption was noted for the gel (without MB) Figure 8. As quantitative
estimation of the PS (MB) loading into the gel is difficult to calculate
directly from the UV–vis absorbance measurements of the gel
samples, we used an indirect method. The loading efficiency was determined
by calculating the change in the characteristic absorption peak of
MB before and after loading to the hydrogel nanocomposite. The calculated
value is about 78% for 1 h loading (Figure S13 in Supporting Information). A decrease in absorbance of the supernatant
dye solution after 1 h is caused because of adsorption of the dye
solution in the porous network of the hydrogel (see Figure S13). The PS loading efficiency is about 78% calculated
using the difference in the absorbance.

Figure 8 UV–visible absorption
spectra of (a) (NIPAM-MBA@UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) hydrogel and (b) (NIPAM-MBA@UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB.

To understand the change in the luminescence properties of
(NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) nanocomposites after MB
loading onto the hydrogel composite, the luminescence measurements
were performed. Figure 9 shows the comparison of the upconversion emission spectra of (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) hydrogel and MB-loaded upconverting
hydrogel. It is quite clear that the intensity of the red emission
is greatly reduced for MB-loaded upconverting hydrogel. The calculated
red to green (R/G) ratio was found to be 5.71 for upconverting hydrogel
and this value reduced to 0.51 for the MB-loaded upconverting hydrogel.
The significant quenching in the intensity of the red emission of
(NIPAM-MBA@UDA NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB
indicates the direct evidence of energy transfer from upconverting
NPs to MB. This is reasonable because of the overlap between the red
emission of the upconverting NPs and the absorption of MB (see Figure 7).

Determination of Singlet
Oxygen
To estimate ROS-like
singlet oxygen production from (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB hydrogel composite upon NIR irradiation,
1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF), a widely used singlet oxygen quencher
was used in our experiment. Singlet oxygen production was inversely
proportional to the intensity of the DPBF photoluminescence (PL) band
at 485 nm when excited at 365 nm. 15 μL of DPBF in acetonitrile
was added to a small piece of (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB composite gel and exposed to NIR light
(980 nm with 500 mW power) for 30 min. A rapid decrease in the intensity
of the DPBF PL band at 485 nm is observed for the (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB hydrogel (25% within
10 min). A 50% reduction in the PL intensity was noted after 30 min
of NIR laser irradiation (Figure 10). This demonstrates the increase in the generation
of singlet oxygen with the irradiation time. The result indicates
that most of the MB in the excited state might transfer their energy
to surrounding oxygen upon irradiation by NIR light. To confirm that
the singlet oxygen produced by MB via excitation of the upconverting
NPs, two control experiments were performed. First, a mixture of free
MB molecules and DPBF in acetonitrile was prepared and exposed to
a 980 nm laser. Second, a mixture of (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) hydrogel containing the DPBF prepared
in acetonitrile was exposed to 980 nm laser light (without MB). The
resulting mixtures were excited at 365 nm to observe the peak at 485
nm. Both the control experiments suggest that there is no change in
the intensity of the PL band at 485 nm (shown in Figure 10). These results imply that
MB was effectively activated by the emission from upconverting NPs
which led to the production of singlet oxygen.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, an upconverting hydrogel nanocomposite (NIPAM-MBA-10-UDA@NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) was synthesized by reacting
the UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs with a thermosensitive NIPAM monomer using the thermal initiator
AIBN. The PS (MB) was efficiently confined in a NIPAM hydrogel matrix
to form (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB using a swelling diffusion method. The hydrogel nanocomposites
display high swelling characteristics in water, resulting in porous
structures leading to high loading of MB (∼78% in 1 h). The
MB-loaded upconverting hydrogel nanocomposites have been evaluated
for their application in NIR-laser-triggered PDT. The experimental
results have shown that the emission from upconverting NPs excited
by NIR radiation can effectively activate the PS (MB) to generate
ROS such as singlet oxygens. The results suggest that the developed
composite gel can find potential use in PDT.

Synthesis of
UDA Capped Yb3+/Er3+-Doped
NaYF4 NPs
A commercial microwave reactor (ANTONPAR)
system was used for the synthesis of the 10-UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs. In a typical procedure,
the mixture of 0.78 mmol of Y(NO3)3, 0.20 mmol
of Yb(NO3)3, and 0.02 mmol of Er(NO3)3 were added to 10 mL distilled water in a 50 mL round-bottom
flask. Then, 2 mmol of 10-UDA in 5 mL ethanol was added to the reaction
mixture and stirred for 2 h. Subsequently, 8 mmol of NaF in 10 mL
water was added to the above mixture and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently,
the mixture of nitrate solution in a capping agent with the fluoride
solution was transferred to a microwave reaction vessel. The resultant
reaction mixture was heated to 160 °C for 10 min with eventual
cooling to room temperature. The mixture was precipitated by the addition
of ethanol and isolated by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 10 min.
The isolated 10-UDA-capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs were dried under vacuum for 24 h.

Synthesis of (NIPAM-MBA@UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) Hydrogel
In a typical
reaction, 3.4 mmol
NIPAM and 0.075 mmol MBA were added to a flask containing 1.5 mL DMSO
and sonicated for 10 min or until the solution turns to clear. Then,
20 mg of 10-UDA capped Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs in 1 mL DMSO and 5 mg AIBN were added to the above mixture.
The mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 25 °C under
Ar atmosphere for 15 min. The resulting mixture was slowly heated
to 70 °C under an Ar atmosphere and maintained for 15 min at
this temperature. The (NIPAM-MBA-10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) hydrogel nanocomposites was purified by removing
the byproducts and by dispersing in DMSO. The hydrogel nanocomposites
were dried under vacuum at 60 °C.

sample of the (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) hydrogel nanocomposite was kept in a 20 mL glass vial and
dispersed in 10 mL of distilled water. At regular intervals, the nanocomposite
gel was taken out of the glass vial using forceps and weighed after
blotting on an absorbent tissue paper to eliminate excess solvent
water molecules. The water uptake was calculated using the following
equation  Wup refers to
the water uptake, and Wwet and Wdry refer to the weight of wet and dry nanocomposite
gel, respectively. Swelling experiments were repeated 3 times for
upconverting hydrogel nanocomposites. A similar study was performed
for the swelling measurements in hexane.

Loading of MB onto (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) Hydrogel Nanocomposites
Before
the addition of MB to the hydrogel nanocomposites, the absorbance
of MB was recorded at 660 nm using a UV–visible spectrometer.
The loading of MB onto the (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) hydrogel nanocomposites was carried out
by adding 3 mL of 10 μM MB to the small piece of (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+) hydrogel nanocomposites
for 1 h at room temperature. Free MB molecules were removed by re-dispersing
the upconverting hydrogel nanocomposites in water and removed supernatants
3 times. Finally, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at
660 nm. The resulting (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB composite was dried for further use. The percentage
of MB loaded into the hydrogel nanocomposites was calculated from
the following equation  

Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Detection
DPBF
was used as a probe to detect the singlet oxygen (1O2) through luminescent measurements. In a typical experiment,
30 μL of DPBF in acetonitrile (5.0 mM) was mixed with 50 mg
of the (NIPAM-MBA@10-UDA-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@MB composite in 2 mL acetonitrile. Free MB molecules or 10-UDA-capped
Yb3+/Er3+-doped NaYF4 NPs (bare NPs)
were dispersed in acetonitrile solvent and mixed with DPBF which was
used for the control experiments The solutions were constantly irradiated
by 980 nm NIR laser and emission at 485 nm was observed at fixed
time intervals. The 1O2 generated by photoexcitation
of MB dye solution reacts irreversibly with DPBF, thus decreasing
the intensity of the DPBF PL band at 485 nm when excited at 365 nm.

Characterization
The PXRD patterns of the 10-UDA-capped
NPs were acquired using a Rigaku-SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with
a D/tex Ultradetector and a Cu Kα source operating at 40 kV
and 50 mA. The scan range was set from 20° to 90° with a
step size of 0.020 and scan rate of 2°/min. The samples were
powdered completely and spread evenly on a quartz slide. Field-emission
SEM images were collected on the SUPRA 55-VP JSM-with patented GEMINI
column technology. The samples loaded into the instrument were first
coated with a thin film of gold in order to avoid charging effects.
Samples were prepared by placing a drop of dilute DMSO/H2O/toluene dispersion of NPs and hydrogel nanocomposites. The size
and morphology of the NPs were obtained using the FEI Tecnai G2 UTwin
(200 keV) TEM instrument. The mapping and SAED pattern analyses were
also carried out using the same instrument. The absorption measurements
were recorded using a Hitachi U4100 spectrophotometer. The samples
were taken in a 3 mL quartz cuvette (path length, 1 cm). FTIR spectra
were acquired with a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer 1000 with a resolution
of 2 cm–1. The solid samples were taken as dry powder
and pelletized with KBr, and the pellets were placed on the sample
holder. Upconversion measurements were done by exciting the 1 wt %
NP dispersion with a 980 nm diode laser from RgBLase LLC, which was
coupled to a fiber with a core diameter of 100 μm. The emitted
light was detected using a Horiba JobinYvon fluorimeter equipped with
a photomultiplier tube. To remove the scattered excitation light,
a long-band pass filter (495 nm) was used on the excitation side.
All upconversion emission spectra were measured with the same slit
width at the same excitation laser power of 500 mW.
