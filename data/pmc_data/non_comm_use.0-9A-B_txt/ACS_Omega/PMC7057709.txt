The eye lens is mainly
composed of the highly ordered water-soluble
(WS) proteins named crystallins. The aggregation and insolubilization
of these proteins lead to progressive lens opacification until cataract
onset. Although this is a well-known disease, the mechanism of eye
lens protein aggregation is not well understood; however, one of the
recognized causes of proteins modification is related to the exposure
to UV light. For this reason, the spectroscopic properties of WS lens
proteins and their stability to UV irradiation have been evaluated
by different biophysical methods including synchrotron radiation circular
dichroism, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopies. Moreover,
dynamic light scattering, gel electrophoresis, transmission electron
microscopy, and protein digestion followed by tandem LC–MS/MS
analysis were used to study the morphological and structural changes
in protein aggregates induced by exposure to UV light. Our results
clearly indicated that the exposure to UV radiation modified the protein
conformation, inducing a loss of ordered structure and aggregation.
Furthermore, we confirmed that these changes were attributable to
the generation of reactive oxygen species due to the irradiation of
the protein sample. This approach, involving the photodenaturation
of proteins, provides a benchmark in high-throughput screening of
small molecules suitable to prevent protein denaturation and aggregation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
crystalline lens is a transparent, elastic, avascular organ
that allows refracting light to focus objects on the retina.1 Besides the accommodation of objects on the retina,
crystalline lens protects the retina from the damage of ultraviolet
light.2 The lens high transparency and
refraction are due to the lack of organelles within the mature lens
fiber cells and to the highly ordered structure of the water-soluble
(WS) proteins called crystallins.3−5

Crystallins are
present at an extraordinary high concentration,
up to 450 mg/mL, in the eye lens and are essential for the maintenance
of lens transparency and refraction.6 The
structural stability and solubility of crystallins, enhanced by protein
interactions, is important to lens transparency since they last a
lifetime with virtually no protein turnover.7 Indeed, at a high protein concentration, crystallins repel each
other and form short-range interactions in a dense liquid or glass-like
structure, which allows the homogeneity of the refractive index inside
the single mature lens fiber cells.6 Despite
this homogeneity, a gradient of refractive index in the crystalline
lens from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386
in the less dense cortex has been detected,8,9 which
contributes to the correction of the spherical aberration of the lens
so that light can focus onto the retina with minimal scattering.10

Three groups of mammalian soluble lens
proteins, named α-,
β-, and γ-crystallins, are identified and isolated according
to their molecular weight.6,8−10 Notably, although present in different forms of aggregation, all
α-, β-, and γ-crystallin monomers have a similar
molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa.11

α-Crystallin makes up about 40% of eye lens proteins.
It
exists as a large aggregate of approximately 800 kDa composed of two
subunits, αA- and αB-crystallin, which adopt a spherical
structure with an internal cavity.12 Aside
from its role in sustaining the refractive index, α-crystallin
plays an important role in preventing the formation of aggregates
that can scatter the light.13 Indeed, α-crystallin
is a molecular chaperon that protects eye lens proteins from detrimental
protein aggregation by binding to partially unfolded proteins, maintaining
them in a refolding-competent state, minimizing the size of the nucleating
species, and inhibiting their further growth.14

β- and γ-crystallins belong to the βγ-superfamily
that has evolved from a common primordial source.15 This superfamily is more heterogeneous, and different isoforms
of these proteins have been identified. β-Crystallins are identical
to γ-crystallins in structure and play an important role in
the maintenance of the lens refractive index. Unlike γ-crystallins,
β-crystallins have various forms of homomers and heteromers
and become easily denatured both thermally and chemically.16 The βγ-superfamily is structurally
characterized by the presence of two Greek key motifs17−20 consisting of four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet structures.
The relative position of these domains in crystallins differs, having
two different conformations referred as either “closed”
or “opened”, respectively.21 It has been suggested that an opened conformation forces crystallins
to favor intermolecular domain interactions characteristic of oligomers
compared with intramolecular contacts present in a closed conformation
characteristic of monomeric crystallins.

The aggregation and
insolubilization of crystallins cause the degeneration
and opacification of crystalline lens, inducing the formation of cataract.22−24 Although this disorder is a well-known disease, the mechanism of
eye lens protein aggregation is not well understood. This abnormal
aggregation is considered to be triggered by various post-translational
modifications that have been described in many reviews.25−27 Among the possible causes of these modifications, the action of
free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by UV radiation
has been found.28 Indeed, UV radiation
is considered one of the factors responsible for oxidative changes
in lens proteins with age and in cataract onset.29,30 However, protein structural changes due to UV irradiation so far
has not been well identified. Here, we aim to show the protein aggregation
mechanism by UV irradiation initialized by the ROS formation.

Structural and mechanistic studies performed on γD- and αB-crystallins
demonstrated that these proteins can form amyloid fibers when aggregated.
Indeed, γD-crystallin forms amyloid fibers when denatured by
acid, while it precipitates as both disordered aggregates and amyloid
fibers upon UV irradiation.31−34 On the other hand, αB-crystallin forms an amyloid
structure when incubated at 60 °C in the presence of 10% TFE.35

Recently, we demonstrated that the high
photon flux and brilliance
of synchrotron radiation can induce protein denaturation when repeated
consecutive synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectra
are acquired in the far-UV region and that this phenomenon can be
used to study the effects of ligand and medium composition on protein
stability.36−38 Moreover, studies performed in the presence of the
positive ROS fluorescent probe dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR-123) demonstrated
that ROSs have been produced
in a water solution exposed to either synchrotron radiation or UV-C
light (254 nm), indicating the involvement of these species in the
protein denaturation (personal communication).

With the aim
to study the
spectroscopic properties of water-soluble
lens proteins and the conformational changes due to their exposure
to UV light, we isolated the water-soluble (WS) protein fraction from
porcine lenses, which was analyzed by biophysical techniques including
SRCD, fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. While
previous studies were conducted on single crystallin protein isoforms,
in this work, the total water-soluble fraction was used, permitting
to evaluate the protective and/or cooperative contribute of each protein
on the misfolding and aggregation process. The use of SR exposure
as a tool to trigger UV denaturation is a novel methodology in this
field. Our results clearly indicated that the exposure to UV light
strongly modified the protein conformation, inducing their aggregation
with a mechanism mediated by ROS.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Isolation and Characterization
of Water-Soluble
Lens Proteins
The water-soluble fraction (WS) of porcine
lens proteins was extracted from young healthy animal lenses and characterized
by both SDS-PAGE and LC–MS/MS. Electrophoretic analysis (Figure S1) shows that, under non-reducing conditions,
the molecular weight distribution of this fraction is in the 17–47
kDa range. Under reducing conditions, the electrophoretic separation
pattern simplifies, showing the presence of the four-band pattern
corresponding to the classical crystallin protein profile in the 17–25
kDa molecular weight range, while the protein band at 48 kDa disappears,
indicating the presence of a dimeric structure.

LC–MS/MS
analysis of the tryptic digest (Table S1 in the Supporting Information) identifies the presence of tryptic
fragments with a mass and sequence corresponding to that of α-,
β-, and γ-crystallin proteolytic products, indicating
the presence of these proteins in the WS fraction.

2.2 Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
The
far- and near-UV CD spectra of WS proteins are reported in Figure 1. The far-UV CD spectrum
(Figure 1A) is characterized
by the presence of a positive band at 194 nm and a negative band at
about 215 nm, indicative of a predominant β-strand secondary
structure.39 The near-UV CD spectrum shows
a positive band at about 265 nm that includes the contribute of disulfide
groups and a negative band at about 295 nm due to the Lb transition40,41 of aromatic side chain
residues (Figure 1B).

and after (red) exposure to UV-C light (254 nm). (A) Far-UV CD spectra
of WS proteins (0.09 mg/mL) in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, measured
with a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter. Conditions: response of 1
s, data pitch of 0.5 nm, 1.0 nm bandwidth, and 0.1 cm path length
cell (200 μL). (B) Near-UV CD spectra
of WS proteins (0.09 mg/mL) in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, measured
with a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter. Conditions: response of 1
s, data pitch of 0.5 nm, 1.0 nm bandwidth, and 0.1 cm path length
cell (200 μL).

The exposure to UV-C
radiation for 45 min profoundly modified the
CD spectra in both the examined UV regions. The bands at 194 and 215
nm, characterizing the far-UV CD spectrum, disappeared, replaced by
a negative band at 205 nm with a shoulder at about 222 nm, suggesting
the presence of a predominant unordered conformation (Figure 1A) as confirmed by the estimation
of the secondary structure (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Moreover, in the near-UV CD spectrum, the negative
band at 295 nm disappeared, while the intensity of the positive band
at 265 nm strongly decreased (Figure 1B), confirming the disruptive effect of the exposure
to UV-C light on the protein conformation.

This effect, in a
diluted protein solution, is the result of two
different mechanisms, which both induce the formation of ROS. The
first is due to the photolysis of solvent (water) molecules present
in large concentration (about 55 M)42 with
the generation of the hydroxyl radical ·OH and the
superoxide anion radical O2·–,42,43 which can react with different protein targets including aromatic
residues, methionine, cysteine, and disulfide bonds. The latter mechanism
involves a direct interaction of UV light with protein chromophores
that can capture the UV radiation forming excited states able to transfer
an electron to nearby groups or to give radical anions via hydrated
electrons formation,44 disrupting the secondary
structure of proteins.

2.3 Synchrotron Radiation Circular
Dichroism Spectroscopy
The high photon flux and brilliance
of the synchrotron radiation
of the Diamond Light Source synchrotron allow the direct investigation
of the WS lens protein denaturation mediated by UV-light by acquiring
consecutive repeated SRCD spectra in the far-UV region. Indeed, it
has been demonstrated that a photodenaturation of ordered proteins
occurs when consecutive repeated scans were collected,36,38,45 and that this is essentially
due to the generation of free radicals (personal communication).

To this purpose, 30 consecutive repeated scans in the 185–260
nm region were collected (Figure 2A). A drastic change in the far-UV SRCD spectrum of
the WS protein fraction was detected after 30 scans, and the analysis
of the secondary structure content indicated an increase in the unordered
structure content from 30 to 35% to which corresponds a decrease in
the β-strand content (from 39 to 36%) and, more generally, in
the ordered structure content (Figure 2B) likewise observed in the UV-C irradiation experiments.

SRCD scans of WS proteins (0.45 mg/mL) in 10 mM phosphate buffer solution,
pH 7.2, measured with B23 module B. SR irradiation time is indicated
in the legend. The solid black line indicates the first scan and the
solid red line the 30th scan. Conditions: integration time of 1 s,
0.02 cm path length cell (60 μL), and monochromator bandwidth
of 1.8 nm. (B) Plot of the secondary structure component change during
the experiment (α-helix in black, β-strand in red, unordered
in blue, and turns in gray).

To exclude an effect related to a local heating, comparative thermal
stability experiments in the 5–90 °C range were performed
(Figure 3A). After
heating, only a small decrease (less than 20%) in the intensity of
the CD bands was observed, while no difference in the shape of the
spectrum was detected. Moreover, the secondary structure estimation
revealed the absence of any substantial difference in the secondary
structure content (Figure 3B), indicating a specific and different pathway in the protein
denaturation due to heating in comparison to that induced by UV exposure.

monochromator bandwidth of 1.2 nm. Inset: melting curves of WS proteins

Plot of secondary structure component change during the experiment
(α-helix in black, β-strand in red, unordered in blue,
and turns in gray; stars represent the structure at 20 °C recorded
after the heating process).

The melting curve constructed by plotting the ellipticity at 194
nm versus temperature (Figure 3A, inset) showed the presence of two equilibria having TM values of 21 and 60 °C. The presence
of two equilibria reflects the heterogeneity of the WS protein fraction
isolated. Moreover, the comparison of the SRCD spectrum recorded at
20 °C during the thermal denaturation assay and that at the end
of the heating process showed an evident difference at 216 nm, suggesting
that the denaturation process is not completely reversible and that
proteins adopted a structure near to the native conformation after
heating.

2.4 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Parallel
fluorescence analysis of the WS protein fraction was carried out by
recording the fluorescence emission spectra in the 310–550
nm range after selective excitation of the Trp residues at 295 nm.
Indeed, these residues play a crucial role in the protective mechanism
of lens and retina toward the harmful UV light, dispersing the radiation
energy by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer mechanism.46 Moreover, as demonstrated by the near-UV CD
studies, they are dramatically modified by the exposure to UV radiation.

The analysis of fluorescence emission showed that the exposure
to UV-C radiation induced both an emission shift to longer wavelengths
(Figure S2) and a quenching in the Trp
emission (Figure S3). Indeed, the untreated
WS protein fraction displays an emission maximum at 338 nm, characteristic
of shielded Trp residues, while after exposure to UV light, the Trp
emission shifted to 363 nm, characteristic of fully exposed residues.47 Moreover, the fluorescence intensity decreased
as a function of the irradiation time (Figure 4). The most likely mechanism involved in
these processes is related to the ROS generation (direct and indirect
mechanism previously described) by exposure to UV light as confirmed
by experiments on either Ac-Trp-NH2 (Figure S3) or WS proteins in the presence of ascorbic acid
(Figure S5).

Figure 4 WS proteins fluorescence
quenching at increasing irradiation time.
Fluorescence spectra were measured as a function of the irradiation
time (indicated). WS proteins were 0.025 mg/mL in 10 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7.2. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a 10 ×
10 mm Suprasil quartz cell on a Perkin Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter
with excitation at 295 nm, and excitation and emission slit were set
at 3.5 nm. Each spectrum is the average of four acquisitions.

2.5 Aggregation of UV-Irradiated
Water-Soluble
Lens Proteins
The capability of UV-C exposure to induce the
aggregation of WS proteins was evaluated determining the aggregation
index (A.I.) by UV spectroscopy,48 analyzing
the absorbance at both 350 and 280 nm (Figure S6). As shown in Table S2, the aggregation
index (A.I.) increased from 3.5, for the untreated protein, to 25,
for the 45 min irradiated protein, indicating the presence of aggregates.
This result was confirmed by both electrophoretic and dynamic light
scattering (DLS) analyses. Indeed, the electrophoresis of the WS protein
fraction after irradiation (Figure 5A), under both reducing and non-reducing conditions,
shows that the protein bands corresponding to the crystallin protein
monomers disappear, generating high-molecular-weight species, which
are so large that they are not able to even enter the running gel
(12% acrylamide) or remain in the wells in the stacking gel (4% acrylamide),
suggesting that the UV light induced the generation of aggregates
resistant to the denaturant action of SDS in electrophoretic analysis.

and UV-irradiated (red solid line) porcine lens proteins. All samples
(2 mg/mL) were dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and equilibrated
for 30 min at 25 °C prior to analysis. Data are shown as percent

under reducing and non-reducing conditions, as indicated. Arrows indicate
very large protein aggregates, which do not enter the running gel
or remain in the wells in the stacking gel. STD HMW, high-molecular-weight
protein standard mixture.

The DLS intensity profile (Figure 5A) of WS proteins before irradiation reveals the presence
of a major component having a hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 14.1 nm
and a minor component at 145 nm, both characterized by high % polydispersity
(%PD) values (∼130%), indicative of high size distribution
heterogeneity. These features are compatible with the multimeric state
of lens proteins.6,8 After irradiation, a significant
reduction of size heterogeneity was observed (%PD = 48%). However,
the major component at Rh = 14.1 nm is still present, along with the
minor component that now appears as a distinct peak at 171 nm, suggesting
that UV-light irradiation does not alter the size distribution of
the non-covalent protein complexes existing under native conditions.

Information on the morphology of protein aggregates were obtained
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure 6). The untreated sample shows
a globular conformation of the WS lens proteins (Figure 6A,B), consistent with literature
data.35 The exposure to UV radiation at
neutral pH induced the appearance of amorphous protein aggregates
(Figure 6C,D), confirming
previous observations and, in particular, the conformational studies
(CD and SRCD) that did not show the presence of amyloid structures.

3 Conclusions
The water-soluble fraction of mammalian lens proteins is composed
almost exclusively of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins
that contribute to the transparency of the lens providing the refractive
index needed to focus light onto the retina. Among the possible causes
of protein damage that lead crystallins to aggregate into insoluble
clusters causing lens opacification and cataract onset, an important
role is represented by the exposure to UV light.

In this paper,
the exposure to either UV-C light (254 nm) or far-UV
synchrotron radiation in the SRCD photostability assay was used to
mimic the effects of UV radiation on WS lens proteins. The major mechanism
by which UV and synchrotron radiation induced protein denaturation
is the generation of reactive oxygen species by either photolysis
of water solvent molecules or excitation of protein chromophores and
successive transfer of electron.44 Our
results demonstrated that the conformational changes observed in the
WS lens protein fraction following the exposure to UV radiation were
mainly due to the action of ROS as confirmed by both the experiments
performed in the presence of ascorbic acid, a scavenger of oxygen
radicals, and the analysis of tryptic digest of irradiated proteins.
Moreover, the denaturation process induced by the exposure to UV light
was more efficient than that observed by heating.

These data
confirm the possibility to use the crude extract of
WS lens proteins containing α-, β-, and γ-crystallins
to study the conformational effects of exposure to different crystalline
toxic agents. In these conditions, all naturally occurring proteins
including α-crystallin whose chaperone-like activity counteracts
the misfolding and aggregation of soluble proteins are present. These
will be useful to study the ability of small molecules to counteract
and protect from damage caused by exposure to both UV light and oxidative
stress.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Pig Lens
Protein Extraction
Pig lenses
of young healthy animals were provided by a local slaughterhouse and
preserved in an antibiotic solution. Lenses, free of irregularities
or inclusions, were washed with MilliQ water prior to handling, decapsulated,
and then grinded with a bistoury blade, suspended in 5 mM EDTA solution
in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and centrifuged for 20 min at 12000
rpm. The supernatant was filtered on a 0.45 μm nylon filter,
aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentration
was determined by the Bradford test.49

4.2 UV Spectroscopy
UV spectroscopy was
performed with a Shimadzu UV-2501 UV–Vis spectrophotometer
(Kyoto, Japan). Samples of 1.0 mL were measured in quartz cuvettes
(Hellma Analytics, Milan, Italy) with a path length of 10 mm. UV absorbance
was recorded from 250 to 500 nm using an integration time of 1.5 s
and steps of 0.2 nm. The spectra were processed with UV-Probe software
(Shimadzu).

4.3 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Emission
fluorescence spectra were collected using a Perkin Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter
(Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with FL-WinLab software (Perkin Elmer).
Samples were measured in a semi-micro quartz cuvette (10 × 4
mm, Hellma Analytics) thermostated at 25 °C. Emission spectra
were recorded from 310 to 550 nm, with excitation at 295 nm, and excitation
and emission slits were set at 3.5 nm at a scan speed of 400 nm/min.
The spectra were the average of four scans.

Protein denaturation
experiments were performed by recording the fluorescence emission
spectra of water-soluble lens proteins (0.1 mg/mL) in 10 mM Tris-HCl
buffer solution, pH 7.2, irradiated for increasing time with a UV
lamp at 254 nm (Spectroline model EF-160C/FE). Data were elaborated
using OriginPro 2019 software (Northampton, MA, USA).

4.4 Circular Dichroism
Far- and near-UV
CD spectra were measured with a Jasco J-1500 CD spectrometer in combination
with a Jasco PTC-423S temperature controller (Jasco International,
Tokyo, Japan).

Far-UV CD spectra were collected in quartz cuvettes
(Hellma Analytics) with a path length of 1 mm at 25 °C from 185
to 255 nm at a scanning speed of 50 nm/min, a response time of 1 s,
a bandwidth of 1 nm, a sensitivity of 200 mdeg, and steps of 0.5 nm.
The spectra recorded were the average of nine scans. The protein concentration
was 0.09 mg/mL in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2.

Near-UV CD
spectra were measured in quartz cuvettes (Hellma Analytics)
with a path length of 10 mm at 25 °C. The CD spectra were collected
from 250 to 360 nm at a scanning speed of 50 nm/min, a response time
of 1 s, a bandwidth of 1 nm, a sensitivity of 100 mdeg, and steps
of 0.5 nm. The spectra recorded were the average of nine scans. The
protein concentration was 0.09 mg/mL in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH
7.2.

The spectra were subtracted of the buffer spectrum and
elaborated
using Jasco Spectra Manager (version 1.53.04) and OriginPro 2019 software.

4.5 Synchrotron Radiation Circular Dichroism
Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism experiments were performed
at the module B unit at B23 beamline at Diamond Light Source, Harwell
Research and Innovation Campus, Didcot, Oxfordshire, UK. SRCD spectra
were recorded in the 185–260 nm wavelength range, with 1 s
integration time, 1 nm digital resolution, and scan speed of 39 nm/min,
using a 0.02 cm Suprasil cuvette (Hellma Analytics). The protein concentration
was 0.45 mg/mL in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2.

UV-denaturation
experiments were performed at 20 °C by recording 30 consecutive
repeated scans in the far-UV region using a bandwidth of 1.8 nm. Thermal
denaturation experiments were carried out in the 5–90 °C
temperature range (increment steps of 5 °C) using a Quantum Peltier
temperature controller. Temperature was equilibrated for 5 min before
collecting the spectra. The SRCD spectra were recorded in the 185–260
nm wavelength range using a 1.2 nm bandwidth.

The SRCD spectra
were subtracted of the buffer spectrum and elaborated
using CDApps50 and OriginPro 2019 software.

4.6 Sample Irradiation
Controlled photodenaturation
of samples was performed with a Spectraline EF-160C/FE lamp equipped
with one 6 W lamp emitting at 254 nm. The water-soluble lens proteins
were irradiated at 0.45 mg/mL concentration solution in a 0.4 cm path
length fluorescence quartz cell at a distance of 7.0 cm, and the volume
irradiated was about of 4 cm3. UV absorbance was recorded
from 250 to 500 nm according to the described conditions.

The
aggregation index (A.I.) was calculated from the UV spectra as Abs350/(Abs280 – Abs350) × 100.48

4.7 Dynamic Light Scattering
Dynamic
light scattering measurements of WS porcine lens proteins samples
(2 mg/mL in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2) before and after UV irradiation
were carried out at 25 °C on a Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments,
Southborough, UK) using disposable polystyrene cuvettes (8.5 mm light
center height, 1 cm path length, and 50 μL) from Sarstedt (Nümbrecht,
Germany). Each measurement consisted of a subset of runs automatically
determined, 15 s each. Scattering data were analyzed with the Nano-7.12
software and expressed as percentage intensity size distribution,
from which the values of hydrodynamic radius (Rh) and % polydispersity
(%PD) were extracted.

4.8 Electrophoresis
Native and UV-irradiated
WS lens proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–12% acrylamide)
under either reducing or non-reducing conditions, following the method
described by Laemmli.51 Sample aliquots
(5 μL, 10 μg) were added with gel loading buffer solution
in the presence or absence of the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol.
When reducing conditions were used, protein samples were heated at
95 °C for 5 min. The electrophoretic runs were performed on a
Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 12 mA constant
current. BlueElf Prestained Protein Marker (Jena Bioscience, Jena,
Germany) was used as protein standard, and the gel was stained with
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 dye (Saint Louis, MO, USA).

4.9 Protein Digestion and LC–MS/MS Analysis
Samples
containing lens soluble proteins, either untreated or UV-irradiated,
were digested using sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, 12.5
ng/mL in 50 mM NH4HCO3) with a substrate-to-enzyme
ratio of 1:25 at 37 °C overnight. The mixtures of peptides were
then analyzed by LC–MS/MS using a nano-HPLC Ultimate 3000 (Dionex
, Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded onto
a NanoEase trap column (Symmetry 300, C18, 5 μm; Waters) with
a flow rate of 8 μL/min and then separated using a 11 cm capillary
column (PicoFrit 75 μm I.D.; New Objective) packed in-house
with C18 material (Aeris Peptide 3.6 μm XB-C18; Phenomenex)
using a flow rate of 250 nL/min and a linear gradient of acetonitrile/0.1%
formic acid from 3 to 40% in 40 min. Digested proteins (100 ng) from
the control sample were analyzed three times under the same analytical
conditions.

The instrument operated in a data-dependent mode,
with a full scan acquired in the Orbitrap (60,000 resolution) in the
300–1700 m/z range, followed
by MS/MS scans of the 10 most intense ions acquired at a lower resolution
in the linear ion trap. Three technical replicates were acquired for
each of the samples (untreated and UV-irradiated) by analyzing 100
ng of digested proteins under identical chromatographic and analytical
conditions.

Raw data files were analyzed with the software Proteome
Discoverer
(version 1.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a Mascot Search
Engine server (version 2.2.4; Matrix Science). The search was done
against the Sus scrofa (pig) section
of the Uniprot Database (version 20170130, 26,103 sequences) setting
trypsin as a digestive enzyme and a mass tolerance of 10 ppm and 0.6
Da for precursor and fragment ions, respectively. Oxidation of Met,
His, Trp, and Pro residues, dioxidation of Trp residues, and protein
N-acetylation were set as variable
modifications. A search against a randomized database was used by
the algorithm Percolator to assess the false discovery rate (FDR).
Data were filtered to retain only proteins identified with at least
two unique peptides with high confidence (≥99%). Proteins were
grouped into protein families according to the principle of maximum
parsimony, and a relative quantification of the peptides and proteins
between treated and UV-irradiated samples was obtained using the precursor
ion area detection node of Proteome Discoverer.

4.10 TEM
About 25 μL of the sample
(WS lens proteins, 50 μM in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, non-irradiated
or irradiated for 45 min with a 256 nm benchtop UV lamp) was positioned
on a 400 mesh film and dyed with a solution of 1% uranyl acetate for
2 min. Samples were observed with a 100 kV Tecnai G2 (FEI) transmission
electron microscope. Images were acquired using a Veleta (Olympus
Soft Imaging System) digital camera.
