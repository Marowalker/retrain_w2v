Steep-slope
β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane negative
capacitance field-effect transistors (NC-FETs) are demonstrated with
ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide in the gate dielectric stack.
Subthreshold slope less than 60 mV/dec at room temperature is obtained
for both forward and reverse gate-voltage sweeps with a minimum value
of 34.3 mV/dec at the reverse gate-voltage sweep and 53.1 mV/dec at
the forward gate-voltage sweep at VDS =
0.5 V. Enhancement-mode operation with a threshold voltage of ∼0.4
V is achieved by tuning the thickness of the β-Ga2O3 membrane. Low hysteresis of less than 0.1 V is obtained.
The steep-slope, low hysteresis, and enhancement-mode β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs are promising as an nFET candidate for
future wide band gap complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic
applications.

Introduction
High-temperature solid-state
devices and circuits are required
for many applications such as in aerospace, automotive, nuclear instrumentations,
and geothermal wells.1,2 Silicon-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS) technology is not able to operate at such high temperatures,
which is limited by its relatively small band gap of 1.12 eV. CMOS
circuits using wide band gap semiconductors are promising in these
high-temperature logic applications. Monoclinic β-Ga2O3 is one of the promising candidates as an n-type channel
material because of its ultrawide band gap of 4.6–4.9 eV and
high electron mobility of ∼100 cm2/V·s.3−10 The ultrawide band gap can suppress the carrier distribution at
the tail of Boltzmann distribution at high temperatures. Meanwhile,
β-Ga2O3 also has the advantage of having
low-cost native bulk substrates that can be synthesized in large sizes
through melt-grown Czochralski, edge-defined film-fed growth, and
floating zone methods.11−16 To reduce power consumption in wide band gap CMOS logic circuits,
enhancement-mode operation with a threshold voltage (VT) greater than zero and small subthreshold slope (SS)
are required, similar to Si CMOS because the enhancement-mode operation
and small SS reduce both the static leakage current and the supply
voltage.17 The SS of metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) is limited by the Boltzmann thermal
distribution of electrons as 2.3kBT/q, which is around 60 mV/dec at room
temperature. The SS would increase much more for conventional MOSFETs
operated at high temperatures. Negative capacitance FETs (NC-FETs)
have been proposed and attracted much attention to overcome the thermionic
limit of the SS.18 In an NC-FET, an insulating
ferroelectric material layer is inserted in the gate stack and serves
as a negative capacitor so that the channel surface potential can
be amplified more than the gate voltage, and hence, the device can
operate with the SS less than 60 mV/dec at room temperature. Hafnium
zirconium oxide (HZO) is a recently discovered CMOS compatible ferroelectric
thin-film insulator with the ability to maintain ferroelectricity
with an ultrathin physical thickness down to less than 2 nm.19−23 Therefore, the integration of wide band gap semiconductors and ferroelectric
HZO can reduce the thermionic SS degradation at high temperatures
and can reduce power consumption in high-temperature logic applications.

In this paper, we demonstrate β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs with ferroelectric HZO in a gate dielectric stack. SS less
than 60 mV/dec at room temperature is obtained for both forward and
reverse gate-voltage (VGS) sweeps with
a minimum value of 34.3 mV/dec at the reverse gate-voltage sweep and
53.1 mV/dec at the forward gate-voltage sweep at VDS = 0.5 V. The enhancement-mode operation is achieved
by tuning the thickness of β-Ga2O3 with
a VT of 0.47 V for the forward gate-voltage
sweep, a VT of 0.38 V for the reverse
gate-voltage sweep, and a low hysteresis less than 0.1 V.

Experiments
Figure 1a shows
the schematic diagram of β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs,
which consists of a 86 nm thick β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane as the channel, a 3 nm amorphous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer and a 20 nm polycrystalline HZO layer
as the gate dielectric, a heavily n-doped (n++) silicon substrate
as the gate electrode, and a Ti/Au source/drain as the metal contacts.
The silicon substrate was first cleaned by an RCA standard cleaning
and diluted by an HF dip, to remove organic, metallic contaminants,
particles, and unintentional oxides, followed by rinsing in deionized
water and drying. The substrate was then transferred to an atomic
layer deposition (ALD) chamber to deposit a 20 nm Hf1–xZrxO2 film
at 250 °C, using [(CH3)2N]4Hf
(TDMAHf), [(CH3)2N]4Zr (TDMAZr),
and H2O as the Hf precursor, Zr precursor, and oxygen precursor,
respectively. The Hf1–xZrxO2 film with x = 0.5
was achieved by controlling the HfO2/ZrO2 cycle
ratio to be 1:1. To encapsulate the Hf1–xZrxO2 film, 3 nm Al2O3 was subsequently in situ-deposited by using
Al(CH3)3 (TMA) and H2O as precursors
at the same 250 °C, to prevent the degradation of HZO by the
reaction with moisture in air. The amorphous Al2O3 layer is also used for capacitance matching and gate leakage current
reduction. The importance of this interfacial Al2O3 layer on capacitance matching is discussed in detail in ref (23). Rapid thermal annealing
in nitrogen ambient was then performed for 1 min at 500 °C to
enhance the ferroelectricity.23 A thin
β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane was mechanically
exfoliated and transferred to the Al2O3/HZO/n++
Si substrate from a (−201) β-Ga2O3 bulk substrate with an Sn-doping concentration of 2.7 × 1018 cm–3 (determined by the C–V measurement7). Source and drain regions were defined by electron-beam lithography
using ZEP520A as the e-beam resist. An Ar plasma bombardment for 30
s was then applied to generate oxygen vacancies to enhance the surface
n-type doping for the reduction of the contact resistance, followed
by Ti/Au (30/60 nm) electron-beam evaporation and lift-off processes. Figure 1b shows the false-color
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the fabricated β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs with four different channel lengths
on the same membrane, capturing the β-Ga2O3 membrane and the Ti/Au electrodes. Figure 1c shows the cross-sectional transmission
electron microscopy image of the HZO/Al2O3 gate
stack. All device electrical characterizations were carried out at
room temperature with a Keysight B1500 Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer
and a Cascade Summit probe station.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2a shows
the polarization versus voltage hysteresis loop (P–V) for the TiN/20 nm HZO/TiN capacitor at
different annealing temperatures. The P–V shows a clear dielectric to ferroelectric transition of
HZO after annealing, whereas the P–V shows a weak dependence on the annealing temperature above
400 °C. The metal–insulator–metal capacitors are
used for the extraction of Landau coefficients (α, β,
and γ) for the ferroelectric HZO layer only. Figure 2b shows the polarization versus
voltage (P–V) characteristics
for the n++ Si/20 nm HZO/3 nm Al2O3/Ni stack
(the same gate stack of β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs)
annealed at 450 °C at different voltage sweep ranges. The P–V shows a clear ferroelectric
hysteresis loop. The P–V characteristics
of a thin-film ferroelectric insulator can be modeled using the Landau–Khalatnikov
(L–K) equation.18 The L–K
equation for P–V can be expressed
as , where Vf is
the voltage across the ferroelectric insulator, P is the polarization charge, tf is the
thickness of the ferroelectric insulator, α/β/γ
are the Landau coefficients, and ρ is an equivalent damping
constant of the ferroelectric insulator. Landau coefficients are extracted
directly from the P–V characteristics
in Figure 2a on ferroelectric
HZO after annealing.23 In addition, the
Landau coefficients are also extracted by fitting to the experimental
data using the L–K equation (assuming dP/dt = 0 for static P–V measurement) to be α = −7.91 × 108 m/F,
β = 1.72 × 1010 m5/F/C,2 and γ = 0 m9/F/C,4 as shown in Figure 2c. Note that the P–V calculated from the L–K equation shows S-shape,
where the negative dP/dV is the
negative capacitance, as shown in Figure 2c. However, this negative dP/dV cannot be observed from the experimental P–V (Figure 2a,b) because the negative capacitance state
is unstable, which leads to hysteresis in the real experimental P–V measurement. Energy (U) versus charge (Q) is plotted based on
the experimental Landau coefficients and calculated using L–K
equations as in Figure 2d. The negative second-order derivative (d2U/dQ2) also indicates the existence of
negative capacitance. The energy of the ferroelectric capacitor tends
to stay at the local minimums of the U–Q such that the negative capacitance (where d2U/dQ2 < 0) becomes
unstable. As a result, NC-FETs may exhibit a large hysteresis if the
unstable negative capacitance effect is too strong. The key design
for the β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs in this work is
to stabilize the unstable negative capacitance by matching the capacitance
of the Al2O3 layer (Cox) and the depletion capacitance (CD)
of the β-Ga2O3 layer with the capacitance
of the ferroelectric HZO layer (CFE).
Therefore, low hysteresis and sub-60 mV/dec SS at room temperature
can be achieved at the same time.

second-order derivative (d2U/dQ2) indicates the existence of negative capacitance.

Figure 3a shows the normalized ID–VGS characteristics
in the log
scale of a β-Ga2O3 NC-FET. The back-gate
bias is swept from −0.4 to 2 V in 40 mV per step, whereas the
drain voltage (VDS) is biased at 0.1,
0.5, and 0.9 V. The whole sweep takes roughly 1 min. This device has
a channel length (Lch) of 0.5 μm
and a channel thickness (Tch) of 86 nm,
measured by an atomic force microscope. This particular thickness
is chosen to tune the VT slightly above
zero. When the channel is too thick, VT remains negative such that the device becomes depletion-mode, whereas
when the channel is too thin, the conducting current becomes very
small.10 The typical range of the physical
width of these nanomembrane devices is 0.3–1 μm, determined
by the scanning electron microscope for the normalization of the drain
current. The ID–VGS characteristics were measured in bidirection both forwardly
(VGS from low to high) and reversely (VGS from high to low). SS is extracted as a function
of ID for both forward sweep (SSmin,For) and reverse sweep (SSmin,Rev) at various VDS. Figure 3b–d shows the SS–ID characteristics
extracted from Figure 3a at VDS = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 V, respectively.
The device exhibits SSmin,For = 57.2 mV/dec and SSmin,Rev = 41.0 mV/dec at VDS =
0.1 V, SSmin,For = 53.1 mV/dec and SSmin,Rev = 34.3 mV/dec at VDS = 0.5 V, and SSmin,For = 55.0 mV/dec and SSmin,Rev = 34.4 mV/dec
at VDS = 0.9 V. SS less than 60 mV/dec
at room temperature is demonstrated for both forward and reverse gate-voltage
sweeps even at relatively high VDS. Ga2O3 MOSFETs with 15 nm Al2O3 as a gate dielectric exhibit a minimum SS = 118.8 mV/dec, as shown
in Supporting Information section 1. SS–ID characteristics at different VDS are similar, slightly better at high VDS because of the larger impact of a Schottky barrier
at lower VDS. Because of the large band
gap of β-Ga2O3, the band-to-band tunneling
current at high VDS is suppressed.

Figure 3 (a) ID–VGS characteristics
in the log scale of a β-Ga2O3 NC-FET.
This device has a channel length of 0.5 μm
and a channel thickness of 86 nm. SS vs ID characteristics of the same device in (a) at (b) VDS = 0.1, (c) VDS = 0.5, and
(d) VDS = 0.9 V. SS less than 60 mV/dec
at room temperature is demonstrated for both forward and reverse gate-voltage
sweeps.

Figure 4a shows
the ID–VGS characteristics in the linear scale of the same β-Ga2O3 NC-FET as in Figure 3. VT is extracted by linear
extrapolation at VDS = 0.1 V for both
forward and reverse gate-voltage sweeps. VT in the forward gate-voltage sweep (VT,For) is extracted as 0.47 V, whereas VT in
the reverse gate-voltage sweep (VT,Rev) is extracted as 0.38 V. Hence, the enhancement-mode operation with VT greater than zero for both forward and reverse
gate-voltage sweeps is demonstrated. A negligible hysteresis is obtained
for both on-state (high VGS, as shown
in Figure 4a) and off-state
(low VGS, as shown in Figure 3a), except that when VGS is near the threshold voltage region. At
the threshold voltage, low hysteresis is achieved to be 90 mV, calculated
by using |VT,Rev – VT,For|. Note that this hysteresis is negative if we do
not take the absolute value because of the gate-voltage-induced polarization
charge inside the ferroelectric HZO. This is in stark contrast to
the conventional hysteresis from MOSFETs with interface and oxide
traps, where hysteresis is usually positive because of charge trapping
in the defect states. The hysteresis of NC-FETs generally comes from
two origins. The first origin is from the unstable negative capacitance
state in the ferroelectric insulator (d2UFE/dQ2 < 0). This hysteresis
can be completely removed by well-matched capacitances (CFE, Cox, and CD) so that d2(UFE + Uox + UD)/dQ2 is greater than zero for all Qs for total capacitance to remove the unstable negative
capacitance state. The stability condition (static nonhysteretic condition)
for 20 nm HZO/3 nm Al2O3 has been confirmed
to be fulfilled in ref (23) so that it is not the origin of the hysteresis in the β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs in this work. The second origin of the
hysteresis is a dynamic effect of the measurement because of the ferroelectric
dumping factor (ρ) in dynamic L–K equations,24 which can explain the hysteresis measured in
the β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs in this work. Figure 4b shows the ID–VDS characteristics
of the same β-Ga2O3 NC-FET with VGS from −0.5 to 2.5 V in 0.5 V step and VDS swept from 0 to 2 V. A linear current–voltage
relationship at low VDS shows a relatively
good contact property at the metal/β-Ga2O3 interface. The relative low drain current in this work, compared
to that in ref (10), is not clear. The interface situation of β-Ga2O3 on the HZO gate stack seems very different from that
on SiO2 in ref (10). The requirement of a thick β-Ga2O3 membrane (60–80 nm) to observe the β-Ga2O3 enhancement-mode operation indicates the existence
of significant interface traps and surface depletion. Although the
exact mechanism why interface traps do not affect
steep-slope observation on β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs
is not clear at this moment, we suspect that it is related to the
ultrawide band gap of β-Ga2O3.

Conclusions
Steep-slope β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs are demonstrated
with ferroelectric HZO in the gate dielectric stack. SS less than
60 mV/dec at room temperature is obtained for both forward and reverse
gate-voltage sweeps with a minimum value of 34.3 mV/dec at the reverse
gate-voltage sweep and 53.1 mV/dec at the forward gate-voltage sweep
at VDS = 0.5 V. The enhancement-mode operation
with a threshold voltage of ∼0.4 V is achieved by tuning the
thickness of the β-Ga2O3 membrane. In
addition, a low hysteresis less than 0.1 V is obtained. The steep-slope,
low hysteresis, and enhancement-mode β-Ga2O3 NC-FETs are a promising nFET candidate for future wide band gap
CMOS logic applications.
