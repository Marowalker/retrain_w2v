DNase
I footprints of intermolecular DNA triplexes are often accompanied
by enhanced cleavage at the 3′-end of the target site at the
triplex–duplex junction. We have systematically studied the
sequence dependence of this effect by examining oligonucleotide binding
to sites flanked by each base in turn. For complexes with a terminal T.AT triplet, the greatest
enhancement is seen with ApC, followed by ApG and ApT, with the weakest
enhancement at ApA. Similar DNase I enhancements were observed for
a triplex with a terminal C+.GC triplet, though with little
difference between the different GpN sites. Enhanced reactivity to
diethylpyrocarbonate was observed at As that flank the triplex–duplex
junction at AAA or AAC but not AAG or AAT. Fluorescence
melting experiments demonstrated that the flanking base affected the
stability with a 4 °C difference in Tm between a flanking C and G. Sequences that produced the strongest
enhancement correlated with those having the lower thermal stability.
These results are interpreted in terms of oligonucleotide-induced
changes in DNA structure and/or flexibility.

Introduction
Triplex-forming oligonucleotides
(TFOs) bind sequence-selectively
within the major groove of duplex DNA, forming specific hydrogen bonds
to exposed groups on the base pairs (mainly to purines).1−4 Two main families of intermolecular triplexes have been described
in which the third strand is either parallel or antiparallel to the
purine-rich stand of the target. Parallel triplexes are characterized
by T.AT and C+.GC triplets,4,5 while antiparallel
complexes contain A.AT, G.GC, and T.AT triplets.6 Parallel triplexes usually require conditions of low pH
(<6.0), which is necessary for protonation of N3 of the third strand
cytosine.7,8 They also require the presence of divalent
cations (magnesium), which is especially necessary for stabilizing
the T.AT triplet.9−11

Several biophysical techniques have been used
to probe the affinity,
selectivity, and structural effects of TFOs. Several high-resolution
NMR studies12−18 and a limited number of X-ray crystallographic studies19−21 have suggested that the underlying DNA duplex adopts a structure
that is more like A-DNA, while retaining several B-like characteristics.
UV and fluorescence melting studies have been used to determine the
factors that affect triplex stability and to demonstrate selectivity
for their intended target sequences,22,23 while DNase
I footprinting studies have shown the location of TFO target sites
on long DNA fragments and have been used to assess their selectivity
and affinity.24,25 DNase I has been the most commonly
used footprinting probe, although the oligopurine TFO target sites
are often relatively poor substrates for this enzyme.

Because
DNase I cuts from the DNA minor groove, while the TFO is
positioned in the major groove, TFO footprints cannot be caused by
direct steric blockage of the enzyme. DNase I cleavage efficiency
is known to be affected by local DNA structural variations, and An.Tn sequences
are typically poor substrates for the enzyme on account of their narrow
minor groove and rigid structure.26,27 Crystal structures
of DNase I bound to short oligonucleotides showed that the DNA is
bent away from the protein, and this distortion may be an essential
part of the catalytic mechanism, explaining why sequences, such as
Gn.Cn are
also poor substrates.28,29 TFO-induced DNase I footprints
could therefore be due to TFO-induced DNA structural changes or variations
in the duplex flexibility.

Several studies have noted that there
is often enhanced DNase I
cleavage at the 3′-end of the TFO binding site at the triplex–duplex
junction, and this is usually seen on the purine-rich strand.30−35 Enhancements in reactivity to diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) have also
been noted at this location.36 Similarly,
enhanced sensitivity to cleavage by copper–phenanthroline has
been observed at the 3′-end of the purine strand at the triplex–duplex
junction,37 which is also a strong binding
site for ellipticine.38 These enhancements
are restricted to the triplex–duplex junction and are only
seen at a single bond at the 3′-end of the target and so cannot
be explained by global changes in the ratio of the enzyme to free
DNA.39 The exposed base at the terminus
of the third strand could create a site for stacking of agents such
as phenanthroline and ellipticine, though this would not explain why
these enhancements are only seen at the 3′ (not 5′)
junction. Instead, these enhancements are thought to arise from TFO-induced
changes in the local DNA structure that makes the phosphodiester bond
at the duplex–triplex junction more susceptible to DNase I
cleavage. These enhancements are often more pronounced than the footprints
themselves and so are sometimes evident in places where there is no
clear DNase I footprint.40 In other instances,
they have been used to estimate the location of the bound third strand.31

We have previously examined how the stability
of the underlying
duplex affects the apparent stability of the triplex,41 but to date, there have been no studies that systematically
assess the sequence dependence of these TFO-induced enhancements.
We have often used the tyrT DNA fragment for these
footprinting experiments, which we later modified to include a 17
base oligopurine tract tyrT(43–59).42 The 3′-end of this tract ends in an ApC
step and in the present study, we have changed this to ApX and GpX,
where X = each base in turn and examined the interaction of these
targets with 12-mer and 11-mer TFOs using DNase I footprinting as
well as the reaction with DEPC. These studies have been augmented
by fluorescence melting experiments with short oligonucleotides that
are based on the same sequences.

Terminal T.AT
Triplet
DNase I footprints for the interaction
of the 12-mer-T oligonucleotide with four DNA fragments that contain
the same triplex target site, but in which the 3′-A is followed
by each base in turn, are shown in Figure 1. In each case, clear concentration-dependent
footprints are evident that extend to TFO concentrations below 1 μM.
In the original tyrT(43–59) sequence, the
3′-flanking base is C, and results for this are shown in the
left hand panel. As previously noted, the footprint extends above
(5′-) the target site by about four nucleotides and is accompanied
by enhanced cleavage at the 3′-(lower) triplex–duplex
junction (indicated by the arrow). This enhancement shows similar
concentration dependence to the footprint itself, and both are evident
at concentrations around 1 μM. These enhancements have previously
been interpreted as resulting from a triplex-induced conformational
change at the triplex–duplex junction. Similar concentration-dependent
enhancements are evident with the other fragments with T, A, and G
flanking the 3′-A. Visual inspection of these gels suggests
that the enhancement is most pronounced for AC and weakest for AA.
This might indicate that the dinucleotide ApC is most easily distorted
by flanking triplex formation into a form that is most easily cleaved
by DNase I.

Figure 1 DNase I footprinting of the 12-mer-T oligonucleotide with fragments
AX. The experiments were performed in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0,
containing 1 mM MgCl2. Oligonucleotide concentrations (μM)
are shown at the top of each gel lane. Con indicates the control in
the absence of the added oligonucleotide and tracts labeled GA corresponding
to markers for purines. The solid bars indicate the location of the
target site for the 12-mer, while the arrows indicate the location
of the enhancements at the 3′-end of the target site. The DNA
was labeled at the 3′-end, so the gel runs 5′–3′
from top to bottom.

Similar experiments for
the interaction of the 11-mer-TFO with
these sequences are shown in Figure 2A. The 11-mer TFO lacks the 3′-terminal nucleotide
of 12-mer-T, and the base flanking the 3′-end of its target
site is an A for all four fragments. The variable base is therefore
one residue removed from the target site (i.e., AAN). DNase I footprints
can be seen with all four fragments, though these require higher concentrations
than with the 12-mer TFO, as a result of its shorter length, and are
only clearest at the highest concentrations (3 μM). Enhanced
DNase I cleavage (indicated by the arrows) is again evident at each
of the triplex–duplex junctions, and as expected, this is one
base higher than with the 12-mer-T TFOs. These enhancements are generally
weaker than those seen with the 12-mer, and the intensity of the enhanced
band is most pronounced with sequence AC and weakest with AA.

Figure 2 DNase I footprinting
of oligonucleotides 11-mer (A) and 12-mer-C
(B) with fragments AX. The experiments were performed in 50 mM sodium
acetate pH 5.0, containing 1 mM MgCl2. Oligonucleotide
concentrations (μM) are shown at the top of each gel lane. Con
indicates the control in the absence of added oligonucleotide and
tracts labeled GA correspond to markers for purines. The solid bars
indicate the location of the 11-mer (A) and 12-mer (B) target sites.
Note that 12-mer-C generates a mismatched C.AT triplet at the lower
(3′-end) of the target site. The arrows indicate the location
of the enhancements at the 3′-end of the target site. The DNA
was labeled at the 3′-end, so the gel runs 5′–3′
from top to bottom.

Similar experiments were
performed with the 12-mer-C TFO, which
differs from 12-mer-T by replacing the 3′-T with C, generating
an 11-mer triplex of T.AT and C.GC triplets that is followed by a
3′-terminal C.AT triplet mismatch. Previous studies31 suggested that some triplexes, such as this
one, with terminal mismatches produce enhanced DNase I cleavage after
both the canonical (T.AT) and noncanonical, mismatched (C.AT) triplets.
The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 2B and show similar concentration-dependent
footprints to those seen with the 11-mer. In this instance, no enhancements
are evident with the sequences AA and AT. In contrast, two weakly
enhanced bands are seen with sequences AC and AG (indicated by the
arrows). The upper of these bands is at the same position as seen
with the 11-mer-TFO, corresponding to the triplex–duplex junctions
after the canonical T.AT, while the bottom corresponds to the location
of the mismatched C.AT triplet. Once again, the sequence AC produces
the strongest enhancement of DNase I cleavage.

Terminal C+.GC
Triplet
The results presented
above describe triplexes that contain a 3′-terminal T.AT triplet
(or a C.AT mismatch). In order to assess whether the identity of the
terminal triplet affects these properties, we changed the base at
the 3′-end of the target oligopurine tract from A to G, generating
four fragments in which this base (G) is flanked by each base in turn
(fragments GA, GC, GT, and GG). These form a 12-mer triplex with oligo
12-mer-C that is similar to that with 12-mer-T but ends in a C+.GC triplet instead of T.AT. DNase I footprinting experiments
with these four new variants of the tyrT sequence
are shown in Figure 3. Concentration-dependent footprints are evident with all four fragments,
which persist to concentrations of about 0.2 μM. This is lower
than the triplexes with the terminal T.AT triplet, as a result of
the greater stability of the C+.GC triplet. All these footprints
are accompanied by enhanced cleavage at the 3′-end of the target
site, at the triplex–duplex junction. In this instance, the
intensity of the enhanced bands is similar for all four flanking sequences.

Figure 3 DNase
I footprinting of the 12-mer-C oligonucleotide with fragments
GX. The experiments were performed in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0,
containing 1 mM MgCl2. Oligonucleotide concentrations (μM)
are shown at the top of each gel lane. Con indicates the control in
the absence of the added oligonucleotide. The solid bars indicate
the location of the target site for the oligonucleotide, while the
arrows indicate the location of the enhancements at the 3′-end
of the target site. The DNA was labeled at the 3′-end, so the
gel runs 5′–3′ from top to bottom.

We also investigated the interaction of the 11-mer TFO with
these
target sites that end in a 3′-G. This triplex is identical
to that formed between this TFO and the targets ending in A, though
the immediate 3′-flanking base is G instead of A (AGN instead
of AAN). The results of these DNase I footprinting experiments are
shown in Figure 4A
and show concentration-dependent footprints that persist to a concentration
of about 1 μM. This is about 10 times higher than the concentration
that is required to produce DNase I footprints with 12-mer-C at this
target sequence and is similar to that seen with the 11-mer-TFO and
the AN sequences. These footprints are again accompanied by enhanced
cleavage, which as expected, is located one band higher than with
12-mer-C. The intensities of these enhancements are similar for all
four sequences and are stronger than those with the AN targets, even
though the underlying triplex is identical.

of oligonucleotides 11-mer (A) and 12-mer-T
(B) with fragments GX. The experiments were performed in 50 mM sodium
acetate pH 5.0, containing 1 mM MgCl2. Oligonucleotide
concentrations (μM) are shown at the top of each gel lane. Con
indicates the control in the absence of added oligonucleotide, and
tracts labeled GA correspond to markers for purines. The solid bars
indicate the location of the 11-mer (A) and 12-mer (B) target sites.
Note that 12-mer-T generates a mismatched T.GC triplet at the lower
(3′-end) of the target site. The arrows indicate the location
of the enhancements at the 3′-end of the target site. The DNA
was labeled at the 3′-end, so the gel runs 5′–3′
from top to bottom.

We also examined the
interaction of the 12-mer-T TFO with the target
sites that contain a 3′-guanine. This should generate a triplex
with 11 canonical triplets (C+.GC and T.AT) ending with
T.AT, followed by a mismatched T.GC triplet. DNase I footprints for
this interaction are shown in Figure 4B. This produces DNase I footprints that are only apparent
at the highest TFO concentrations (3 μM). These footprints are
accompanied by only weak enhancements, which are one base higher than
those seen with 12-mer-C, at the same position as seen with the 11-mer,
with no enhancements at the mismatched terminal T.GC triplet.

Reaction
with DEPC
DEPC mainly reacts at N7 of adenines.
Its reaction is generally poor in duplex DNA, but it has been used
to detect unusual or distorted DNA structures in which this base is
more exposed.43,44 Enhanced reactivity has previously
been demonstrated at a triplex–duplex junction.36Figure 5 shows the results of DEPC cleavage experiments with the four
AN fragments, in the presence the TFOs 12-mer-T, 11-mer, and 12-mer-C.
The control lanes of these footprints show some reaction with As within
the oligopurine tract (especially in the run of six consecutive As)
and at the 3′-end of the oligopurine tracts of AA and AT (but
not AG and AC). DEPC cleavage at these sites is attenuated by interaction
with the TFOs in a concentration-dependent manner, as expected, as
the TFO binds to N7 of A and prevents access to the probe. There is
no evidence of any ligand-induced enhanced DEPC reactivity in the
presence of 12-mer-T oligonucleotide (Figure 5A; first four panels), even with sequence
AA, which contains an A immediately adjacent to the TFO binding site.

Figure 5 DEPC footprinting
of oligonucleotides 12-mer-T (A), 11-mer (B),
and 12-mer-C with fragments AX. The experiments were performed in
50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, containing 1 mM MgCl2. Oligonucleotide
concentrations (μM) are shown at the top of each gel lane. Con
indicates the control in the absence of the added oligonucleotide
and tracts labeled GA correspond to markers for purines. The solid
bars indicate the location of the target sites for 12-mer-T (A), 11-mer
(B), and 12-mer-C (C). Note that 12-mer-C generates a mismatched C.AT
triplet at the lower (3′-end) of the target site. The asterisks
indicate the location of the enhancements at the 3′-end of
the target site. The DNA was labeled at the 3′-end, so the
gel runs 5′–3′ from top to bottom.

Similar experiments with the 11-mer TFO are shown in the
middle
four panels of this figure (Figure 5B). In contrast to the results with 12-mer-T, enhanced
reaction to DEPC is seen at the 3′-end of the TFO binding site
in the sequence AA, and to a lesser extent in AC, though no enhancements
are apparent with AT and AG. These enhancements are located at the
A that is immediately 3′- to the 11-mer binding site (i.e.,
at AAC and AAA, with
sequences AC and AA, respectively).

Similar experiments showing
the reaction with DEPC in the presence
of 12-mer-C shown are in the final four panels of Figure 5 (Figure 5C). These cleavage patterns are similar to
those formed with the 11-mer TFO and again show enhanced DEPC reactivity
at the 3′-end of the triplex–duplex junction in the
sequences AC and AA (at AAC and AAA, respectively), and is again especially strong for
AA.

Other Probes
We also examined the effect of these TFOs
on the reaction with permanganate (reacting with exposed Ts), micrococcal
nuclease (cleaving at pA and pT), and hydroxyl radicals (generating
an even ladder of cleavage products). None of the TFO target combinations
induced any enhanced reaction with any of these probes.

Triplex Stability
The experiments described above demonstrate
that triplex formation can affect the susceptibility of flanking bases
to some enzymes and chemical cleavage agents. However, these techniques
are not sufficiently sensitive to detect any changes in triplex affinity.
We therefore examined the stability of triplexes that are flanked
by different base pairs by thermal melting studies using fluorescently
labeled synthetic oligonucleotides. In these experiments, the 12-mer
third strand TFO was labeled at the 5′-end with dabcyl, while
the purine strand of the target duplex was labeled at its 5′-end
with fluorescein. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are shown
in Table 1 and were
chosen to correspond to the 12-mer target site in the tyrT fragments. When the triplex is assembled, the fluorophore and quencher
are in close proximity and the fluorescence is quenched. The triplex
melts when the temperature is increased, separating the fluorophore
and quencher, leading to a large increase in fluorescence. These experiments
were performed in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 200 mM NaCl.

pyrimidine-containing TFOs were labeled with 5′-dabcyl, while
the target duplexes were labeled with fluorescein at the 5′-end

Fluorescence melting curves for the four target duplexes in the
presence of 5 μM of the 12-mer-T oligonucleotide are presented
in Figure 6A, and Tm values derived from these are presented in Table 2. These results show
a clear difference in stability of these different complexes, even
though they all contain the same triplex. There is a 4 °C difference
in Tm between the highest (AG) and lowest
(AC).

a Reactions were
performed in 50 mM
sodium acetate pH 5.0 containing 200 mM NaCl. The target duplex concentration
was 0.2 μM with 5 μM TFO.

The results of similar experiments with the 11-mer
TFO on these
four target sequences are shown in Figure 6B and Table 2. As expected, these 11-mer triplexes melt at lower
temperatures than those of the 12-mer-T triplexes, but again, we find
that the different complexes display significantly different melting
temperatures. These differences are less pronounced than for the 12-mer
triplexes but the triplex with sequence AC melts about 2 °C lower
than AG, even though these sequences only differ at two base pairs
distal to the triplex target site.

We also examined the stability
of similar triplexes that contain
a terminal 3′-C+.GC triplet instead of T.AT, using
target duplexes that contain a GC base pair at the 3′-end of
the polypurine tract, flanked by each base in turn. The melting curves
of these four targets with TFO-12-mer-C are shown in Figure 6C, and the Tms are presented in Table 2. Sequence GT has the highest Tm (49.7 °C), though this is only slightly
higher than GC (49.3 °C), GA (48.7 °C), and GG (48.6 °C).
As expected, these Tm values are higher
than those formed with the four targets with a 3′-terminal
T.AT triplet as a result of the greater stability of the C+.GC triplet.

The results of similar experiments with the shorter
11-mer TFO
on these four target sequences flanked by a GC base pair are also
shown in Table 2. As
expected, the Tms of
these 11-mer triplexes are between 8 and 10 °C lower than those
of their 12-mer counterparts. This is a smaller reduction than between
the 11-mer and 12-mer-T for the targets ending with an AT base pair,
reflecting the greater additional stability that is afforded by the
C+.GC triplet compared to T.AT. As expected, there are
only small differences between the Tms of these 11-mer complexes, which only vary by a single
base pair that is located two base pairs distal to the triplex.

Figure 6D shows
the results of melting experiments with the AN target duplexes and
the 12-mer-C TFO, generating a C.AT mismatch at the 3′-end
of the triplex. The Tm values estimated
from these data are shown in Table 2. Although these triplexes have slightly different
melting temperatures, the differences are much less pronounced than
with the 12-mer-T. Similar experiments were also performed with the
12-mer-T and the GN-targets sequences, generating a T.GC mismatch
at the 3′-end of the triplex and the Tms are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that there are no significant
differences between these melting curves. Comparing the Tm of these triplexes with those generated by the fully
matched 12-mer, it can be seen that the terminal mismatch decreases
the triplex stability by about 10 °C (Table 2). It appears that addition of a 3′-T.GC
is destabilizing compared to the 11-mer, while addition of a 3′-C.AT
triplet increases triplex stability.

Discussion
These
results demonstrate that a common feature of intermolecular
DNA triplex formation is the presence of enhanced DNase I cleavage
at the triplex–duplex junction at the 3′-end of the
oligopurine strand of the target. For triplexes with a terminal T.AT
triplet, the strongest enhancement is seen when this is followed by
an ApC step (sequence AC), with the weakest observed at ApA. In principle,
it would be best to compare cleavage of this band in the triplex,
with that in the uncomplexed DNA, in order to assess the fold enhancement
in the presence of the TFO at each target site. However, this is often
not possible to determine, as cleavage of this region is vanishingly
low in the absence of the oligonucleotide. However, we have estimated
the relative enhancements at these steps by comparing the intensity
of the enhanced band with cleavage of other regions of the fragments
that are not affected by triplex binding. These results are shown
in Table 3 and confirm
the strongest enhancement at ApC followed by ApG and ApT, with the
weakest at ApA.

We assume that these enhancements
reflect triplex-induced changes
in the local DNA structure. How might these be reflected in altered
DNase I activity? Crystal structures of DNase I bound to short oligonucleotides
reveal that the enzyme functions by inserting an exposed loop into
the DNA minor groove. Regions with a narrow groove (such as An.Tn tracts) are
therefore poor substrates for the enzyme. Ligand-induced changes in
groove width have previously been used to explain enhancements adjacent
to some small-molecule binding sites.45,46 However, these
changes are unlikely to account for these TFO-induced enhancements,
as they are restricted to a single phosphodiester bond at the triplex–duplex
junction. A circular permutation assay demonstrated that triplex formation
is accompanied by DNA stiffening, rather than a junctional bending
model, an effect that may also explain why third strand binding in
the major groove inhibits DNase cleavage from the minor groove.47 We can envisage two other possibilities to account
for these changes. The BI to BII phosphate backbone configuration
is known to depend on the local dinucleotide sequence, and DNase I
favors the BII configuration.48 It may
be that triplex formation favors the BII configuration at the triple–duplex
boundary, thereby enhancing enzyme cleavage. An alternative, though
related, explanation is that DNase I is known to bend the DNA away
from the minor groove at the cleavage site, and this bending may be
an important part of the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism.28,29,49 Triplex formation may therefore
alter the local deformability of the scissile phosphodiester bond.
This is consistent with the observation that ApC is known to be one
of the most deformable dinucleotides and ApA is one of the most rigid.50,51 Such changes in DNA flexibility may not be restricted to the immediate
sequence, but can be propagated into neighboring sequences, and thereby
account for the observation that the 11-mer produced greater enhancement
with AC than the other three dinucleotides, even though the ApC step
was one base removed from the enhancement. Although it is clear that
triplex formation generates enhanced cleavage at the triple–duplex
junction, the precise origin of this effect will probably require
comparison of crystal structures of a duplex in the presence and absence
of a TFO.

These enhancements are not restricted to flanking
ApN sites, but
are also evident at GpN, at triplex–duplex junctions, following
a 3′-terminal C+.GC triplet. However, these enhancements
are less sequence-dependent and are similar magnitude for all GpN
sites. It may be that the presence of a C+.GC triplet at
the end of the triplex (instead of T.AT), which is known to give greater
affinity, makes it more rigid and less deformable.

The fluorescence
melting experiments with oligonucleotides containing
different flanking sequences showed subtle but significant changes
in triplex stability, especially for the ApN series, with a 4 °C
difference between the highest (ApG) and the lowest (ApC). It may
be significant that the sequences with the lowest Tm generally correspond to the ones that produce the greatest
enhancement in DNase I cleavage. It may be that, for the less stable
complexes, some of the TFO binding energy is used to distort the DNA
helix, or affect its dynamic flexibility, thereby reducing the inherent
stability of the complex. In light of this, the targeting of oligopurine
sites by TFOs might be improved by considering the flexibility of
this flanking sequence.

The changes in reactivity to DEPC were
surprising and showed no
changes for interaction of the 12-mer T with any of the sequences,
even at AA, with an A as the 3′-adjacent base. In contrast,
the shorter (11-mer) sequence produced clear enhancements with the
sequence AA and also with AC, that is, in the sequences AAA and AAC (in which the underlined base corresponds to the terminal triplet
and the one in bold shows enhanced DEPC reactivity). This result is
similar to that with the 12-mer C at these sequences (producing 11
canonical triplets and ending with a C.AT mismatch), for which DEPC
enhancements were again observed with AA and AC. It therefore seems
that DEPC enhancements are generated in sequences AA(A/C) but not AA(G/T) (the interaction of the 12-mer T with AA ends with the sequence
AAT).

These results confirm that enhanced DNase I cleavage is
a common
feature at the 3′-end of triplex–duplex junctions. The
concentration dependence of these enhancements is similar to that
of the footprints themselves and has previously been useful for confirming
triplex formation at target sequences with very poor DNase I cleavage.31,40 In general, the strongest enhancements are seen with complexes that
have lower thermal stability. The effect of flanking bases on triplex
stability and structure may therefore need to be considered when optimizing
triplex target design.

Experimental Section
Oligonucleotides
Three TFOs were used for the footprinting
experiments: 5′-CTCTTTTTTCTT (12-mer-T), 5′-CTCTTTTTTCTC
(12-mer-C), and 5′-CTCTTTTTTCT (11-mer). These were provided
by ATDBio and were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems ABI 394
automated DNA/RNA synthesizer using solid-phase DNA phosphoramidite
synthesis cycles. For the fluorescence melting experiments, similar
TFOs were prepared with 5′-dabcyl (Q) on the TFO and 5′-fluorescein
on the duplex purine strand. The oligonucleotides were purified by
gel filtration, dissolved in water, and kept at −20 °C
until required. Oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis were
obtained from ATDBio and are listed in Table S1.

DNA Sequences for Footprinting
The base at the 3′-end
of the oligopurine tract in tyrT(43–59) is
an A, followed by C presenting an ApC step at the triplex–duplex
boundary. The C at position 42 was changed to each base in turn by
QuickChange PCR using the pairs of primers, as shown in Table S1. A set of four other derivatives was
also prepared in which the A at position 43 was changed to G, followed
by each of the other bases in turn, using the primers which are also
shown in Table S1. The resulting plasmids
were transformed into competent Escherichia coli TG2 cells, and plasmids were prepared using a Qiagen Miniprep kit.
The sequences of the resulting plasmids were confirmed by MWG Eurofins.
In this work, the eight fragments are designated by the bases at positions
43 and 42 (i.e., AC, AG, AT, AA, GC, GG, GT, and GA).

Plasmids
containing the oligopurine target sites were digested with EcoRI and
AvaI and labeled at the 3′-end of the EcoRI site with α-32P dATP using either reverse transcriptase or exo-Klenow fragment.
The fragments of interest were separated from the remainder of the
plasmid DNA on 6% polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and dissolved in 10
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 containing 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) at a concentration of about 10 cps/μL, as determined
on a hand-held Geiger Counter.

DNase I Footprinting
TFO (3 μL) diluted in 50
mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 containing 1 mM MgCl2 was mixed
with 1.5 μL of radiolabeled DNA and incubated at room temperature
for 2 h. DNase I cleavage was performed by adding 2 μL of DNase
I (diluted to about 0.1 units/mL in 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM MnCl2) and digested for 2 min. The reactions
were stopped by adding 5 μL of DNase I stop solution containing
80% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.01% bromophenol blue. The samples
were heated at 100 °C for 3 min and crash-cooled on ice before
subjecting to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Reaction
with DEPC
TFO (3 μL) diluted in 50 mM
sodium acetate pH 5.0 containing 1 mM MgCl2 was mixed with
1.5 μL of radiolabeled DNA and incubated at room temperature
for 2 h, 3 μL of DEPC was then added, and the reaction was left
for 30 min with occasional mixing. The reaction was stopped by adding
2 μL of 3 M sodium acetate, and the DEPC-modified products were
precipitated, cleaved by adding 50 μL of 10% (v/v) piperidine,
heated at 100 °C for 30 min and dried in a vacuum centrifuge.
The pellets were washed with water, dried again, and dissolved in
8 μL of DNase I stop solution.

Gel Electrophoresis
The products of DNase I or DEPC
digestion were separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing
8 M urea. Gels were run at 1500 V for about 90 min and then fixed
in 10% acetic acid and dried onto Whatman 3 MM paper. Dried gels were
exposed to phosphor screens overnight which were scanned with a Typhoon
phosphorimager.

Fluorescence Melting
Fluorescence
melting experiments
were performed as previously described.23 For these experiments, the TFOs were labeled with 5-dabcyl (Q),
that is, 5′-Q-CTCTTTTTTCTT, 5′-Q-CTCTTTTTTCTC, and 5′-Q-CTCTTTTTTCT. The target
duplexes were labeled with fluorescein at the 5′-end of the
purine strand, that is, 5′-F-GAGAAAAAAGARXTGGTTG,
where R = A or G and X = each base in turn; these were annealed with
the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-CAACCAXYTCTTTTTTCTC (Y = C or T and X = each base in turn). These sequences
are listed in Table 1.

Melting profiles were determined using a Roche LightCycler
in a total volume of 20 μL in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, containing
200 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl2. The duplex concentration was
0.25 μM for all experiments, with TFO concentrations of 9, 5,
3, 1, and 0.25 μM. The mixtures were annealed by heating to
98 °C for 5 min and cooling to 35 °C at 0.1 °C/s; the
reaction was held at 35 °C for 5 min before heating to 98 °C
at 0.1 °C/s. The fluorescence profile was recorded for both the
annealing and melting phases, and no hysteresis was observed for any
of these sequences. Melting temperatures (Tm) were estimated from the maxima in the first derivatives of the
melting profiles using the LightCycler software.
