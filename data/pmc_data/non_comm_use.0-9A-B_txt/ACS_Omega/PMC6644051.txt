The
Bunte salt-terminated polyether (BSTP)-based treatment has been developed
for the chlorine-free shrink-resist treatment of wool fibers and fabrics.
However, the effect of BSTP treatment on the physicomechanical and
chemical properties of wool fabrics has not been thoroughly investigated.
In this work, wool fabrics were treated with a commercially available
BSTP at various concentrations by the pad-dry-cure process. The effect
of BSTP coatings on the dyeability, shrink resistance, mechanical
properties, wettability, hydrophilicity, and yellowness of the treated
wool fabrics was systematically evaluated. It was found that the shrinkage
of the treated wool fabrics considerably decreased with an increase
in the BSTP concentration. On the other hand, the tensile strength,
elongation at break, and surface hydrophilicity highly increased with
an increase in the BSTP concentration. The tensile strength of the
treated fabric was better than the tensile strength shown by the blank-treated
fabric even at the lowest investigated concentration of BSTP (60 g/L).
The bending rigidity as well as the bending modulus of wool fabric
also decreased with an increase in the applied concentration of BSTP.
The treatment showed very little effect on the yellowness and whiteness
indices of wool fabric. The stain resistance against C.I. Acid Red
40 of the treated wool fabrics increased with an increase in the applied
concentrations of BSTP. However, against red wine, the stain resistance
decreased at lower concentrations of BSTP but showed a little effect
for the higher concentrations. The coating of wool fabrics with the
BSTP not only reduced the shrinkage of the fabrics but also increased
their hydrophilicity and also the stain resistance against acid dye-based
stain but also negatively affected their dyeability and stain resistance
against red wine, especially at lower BSTP concentrations.

==== Body
Introduction
Wool fiber is a keratin
fiber, which is composed of 18 amino acids including arginine, cystine,
glutamic acid, and glycine. The wool fiber-made fabrics have excellent
antistatic, fire-retarding, wrinkle-resist, heat insulation, and moisture
management properties. The interior of wool fiber is highly hygroscopic,
and therefore it has some levels of antistatic properties.1 The wool fiber surface contains a polyethylene-like
hydrophobic layer, which is made of 18 methyl eicosanoic acid (18-MEA)
bonded to the cuticle surface via thioester linkages, and therefore
the wool fiber surface is quite hydrophobic providing some levels
of stain resistance. However, wool fibers have several deficiencies
including very high shrinkage during laundering. The fabrics made
from them show poor dimensional stability and the felting of the fibers
make the surface of the fabric esthetically unpleasant.

The
physical structure of the outer scaly surface of the wool fiber is
mainly responsible for its shrinkage and felting. During mechanical
agitation, friction, and pressure in the presence of moisture and
heat, the edge of the scales present on the surface of one fiber locks
into the inter-scaling space of another fiber like a “ratchet”
mechanism. As a result, wool fibers interlock and cannot return to
their original position and the shrinkage that takes place become
permanent. Felting is sometimes advantageous, such as for fabrication
of blankets and felted rugs but can be a serious problem for apparel
as it changes the appearance of the fabric.2,3 To
make wool fabric shrink-resistant, the edge of epicuticles needs to
be etched or the inter-scale spaces will need to be covered so that
no interlocking of fibers can take place. Additionally, the removal
of 18-MEA is necessary, to make the fiber surface compatible with
polymers that are used to cover the scales so that they can uniformly
spread on the fiber surface. The polymers used are usually cationic
so that they do not affect the dyeability of wool fiber. However,
they negatively affect the inherent stain-resist properties of the
wool fiber.4

The most popular shrink-resist
treatment for wool fiber in wool industry is the so-called “chlorine-Hercosett”
treatment. In this method, wool fibers are initially treated with
chlorine in acidic conditions followed by coating with a cationic
epichlorohydrin-modified-polyamide resin containing reactive azetidinium
groups.5 Chlorination not only removes
the bound lipids, such as 18-MEA, from the surface of wool fiber but
also makes the surface hydrophilic and compatible with the polyamide
resin coating. The chlorination treatment etches the scale edges,
allows the formation of a uniform polymer coating on the surface of
wool fibers in the subsequent resin treatment, and prevents the treated
fibers from felting by stopping interlocking of fibers. One of the
main advantages is that it is a continuous process and so far is the
most effective and the cheapest method to make wool fiber shrink-resistant.
However, if the chlorination treatment is uneven, it may cause formation
of uneven coating on the chlorinated wool fibers, and may also cause
failure in the shrink resistance test.6 Moreover, the chlorination process is potentially hazardous as it
liberates chlorine gas to the environment and produces absorbable
organic halogen (AOX) residues in effluent, which need treatment before
discharging to watercourses.7 As a result,
in some countries, chlorination treatment is restricted, which demands
the development of an eco-friendly alternative shrink-resist treatment
for wool. Therefore, investigation of nonchlorine-based shrink-resistant
treatments has gained momentum. A range of nonchlorine-based shrink-resist
treatments, such as enzymatic,8−12 sol–gel coating with silanes,13 oxidation treatment followed by coating with a silicone resin,14 and plasma-based coatings,15 have been developed over the years to make wool fabric
shrink-resistant. However, these treatments have several demerits,
such as enzyme treatments are difficult to control causing uneven
treatment, sol–gel coatings affect the handle properties of
the fabric, and plasma treatments are expensive. Therefore, other
simple and cheap alternatives have been investigated.

Initially,
covering of wool fiber scales by coating with polybutadiene, collagen,
and diacrylates has been studied as a means to provide shrink resistance
to wool fiber-made apparels.16−18 However, these coatings were unable
to provide durability of shrink resistance to multiple washing, because
in these coatings no bonding occurs between wool fiber and the polymer
coating. A range of crosslink forming polymeric resins including polyurethane
containing free isocyanate groups (Synthappret LKF), polyurethane
with a bisulfite adduct (Synthappret BAP), Bunte salt-terminated polyether
(Lankrolan SHR3), and poly(dimethylsiloxane) diols in combination
with an amino functional silane crosslinking agent, have been investigated
to make wool fabric shrink-resistant.19−21 However, poor spreading
of hydrophilic polymers on the hydrophobic wool fiber surface produces
uneven coating and poor handle properties causing their commercial
failure.

The coating of wool fibers with BSTPs has been developed
as an eco-friendly shrink-resist treatment for wool by Lewis.20 In this method, no strong oxidation treatment,
such as chlorination, is used that may damage the fiber. The wool
fibers are reacted with a reducing agent to form thiol groups on the
wool fiber surface and the BSTP then forms a polymeric coating on
the treated fiber surface by forming covalent disulfide bonds between
the thiol groups of wool fiber and the −SSO3Na groups
of BSTP. The synthesis, curing mechanism, and application of bi and
trifunctional BSTPs for the shrink resistance of wool fiber have been
reported by Lewis.22,23 To the best of our knowledge,
no published literature reported the effect of the coating of BSTPs
on wool fabric’s dyeability, hydrophilicity, shrink resistance,
stain resistance, and other physicomechanical properties. In this
work, we are reporting the dyeability, hydrophilicity, stain resistance,
shrink resistance, bending rigidity, and other physicochemical properties
of wool fabrics treated with a commercially available BSTP at various
concentrations.

Results and Discussion
The mechanism
of reaction of the BSTP with wool fiber is shown in Figure 1. The wool fabric was pre-treated
with a reducing agent (sodium sulfite) to break down the disulfide
bonds of wool to produce free thiol groups. It can be seen that the
−SSO3Na groups of BSTP reacts with these thiol groups
and covalently binds to wool fibers by forming sulfur linkages.

Figure 1 Mechanism of
reaction of BSTP with thiol groups of wool fiber.

Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR)
Characterization of the Treated Wool Fabrics
The ATR-FTIR
spectra of control and BSTP-treated wool fabrics are shown in Figure 2. The FTIR spectrum
of control wool shows various bands including wool keratin-related
IR bands of amide III, amide II, and amide I peaks at 1227, 1350,
1540, and 1635 cm–1, respectively. The peak at 1506
cm–1 could be attributed to the C–N stretching
and also to the N–H in-plane bending vibrations (amide II)
and its intensity increased with an increase in the applied concentration
of BSTP. The broad peak at 3150–3350 cm–1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl groups of some amino acids of
wool keratin, such as serine and tyrosine.24 In contrast, all BSTP-treated fabrics show new peaks at 668, 926,
1020–1026 (broad peak), 1100 (broad peak), 1363, 2865, 2932,
and 2971 cm–1. The IR bands at 2865 and 2932 cm–1 could be assigned to the methylene groups (−CH2) of BSTP and their intensity increased with an increase in
the concentration of BSTP.25 The absorption
peak located at 2971 cm–1 observed for all the fabric
samples treated with BSTP is due to the stretching vibrations of C–H
of the −CH2 group of BSTP.26 The BSTP-treated wool fabrics show a new band at 1020 cm–1, which could be attributed to the Bunte salt of BSTP, and its intensity
increased with an increase in the concentration of BSTP.24,27 The bands at 668 and 1100 cm–1 are due to the
−CH2 groups of the long chain and −C–O
of ether groups of BSTP, respectively. The FTIR spectra indicate the
presence of BSTP in the treated wool fabrics.

wool fabric and also wool fabrics treated with various concentrations
of BSTP.

Wettability, Yellowness,
and Shrink Resistance of the Treated Fabrics
Table 1 shows whiteness and yellowness
indices of the control and fabrics treated with BSTP at various concentrations.
The whiteness index shown by the control fabric was lower than the
whiteness index shown by various treated samples. The whiteness index
progressively increased with an increase in the concentrations of
BSTP up to 80 g/L BSTP, beyond which the whiteness index slightly
decreased. In contrast, the BSTP-treated samples showed a lower yellowness
index compared to the control fabric, which is advantageous as the
increase in the yellowness index is undesirable. The yellowness index
decreased with the increase in the concentrations of BSTP. The control
fabric showed very low wettability compared to the wool fabrics treated
with various concentrations of BSTP. The water droplet remained almost
unchanged even after 120 min of the test. In contrast, the treated
fabrics showed excellent wettability (Table 1) and the water droplet was absorbed by the
fabric within a few seconds. The hydrophilicity of the fabric increased
with an increase in the concentrations of BSTP. The treatment with
sodium sulfite produced thiols, some of which reacted with thiol groups
of the BSTP and the rest were oxidized to hydrophilic sulfonic acid
groups. The BSTP itself is hydrophilic because of the presence of
hydrophilic, hydroxyl, and thiosulfonate groups resulting in an increase
in the hydrophilicity of the treated fabrics.

a The wettability
was measured at 20 ± 2 °C and 65 ± 2% relative humidity
(RH) by placing a droplet of water (2.82 mg) on fabric samples from
5 cm above. The control sample did not wet even after 120 min.

Table 1 also shows felting shrinkage and felting
tendency of control and BSTP-treated fabrics. The blank-treated control
fabric showed severe felting and shrinkage of 41%, which is consistent
with the shrinkage observed by other researchers.16,18 On the other hand, felting tendency and felting shrinkage of the
BSTP-treated fabric progressively decreased with an increase in the
concentration of BSTP. The fabric treated with 100 g/L BSTP showed
the lowest shrinkage, which was only 14% after 3×5A washes.

Flexural Rigidity and Bending Modulus
Table 2 shows the bending rigidity and the bending
modulus of wool fabric treated with various concentrations of BSTP.
It can be seen that the coating with BSTP greatly affected the bending
stiffness of the fabric as the flexural rigidity and bending modulus
considerably decreased with an increase in the applied concentration
of BSTP. The flexural rigidity in the warp and weft directions of
the control fabric was 7.66 and 6.83 N m, respectively, which decreased
to 5.55 and 4.92 N m, respectively, for the fabric treated with 100
g/L BSTP. Similarly, the bending modulus of wool fabric in the warp
and weft directions decreased from 6335.21 and 5648.77 N/m2 to 4934.26 and 4374.15 N/m2, respectively. The results
suggest that the softness of the wool fabric considerably improved
with the BSTP treatment as the BSTP formed an elastomeric layer on
the surface of wool fabrics.

Surface Morphologies of the Treated Wool
Fabrics
Figure 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the
surface of the control and the BSTP-coated wool fabrics. The image
of untreated wool fabric shows the characteristic scaly structure
of the wool fiber. There is also some debris produced by the damaged
scales visible on the surface of the wool fiber. However, it is evident
that the BSTP formed a uniform coating on the wool fiber surface covering
the scales at higher concentrations than at the lower concentrations.
The scaly structure of wool fibers is visible at the lower concentrations
of BSTP, indicating that a very thin layer of coatings were formed.
The fibers were not bonded together, and therefore they were free
to move to cause some levels of shrinkage. Therefore, the achieved
shrink resistance at these concentrations was poor. At 60 g/L of BSTP
concentration, some bonding between fibers was observed but the coatings
formed were uneven at this concentration. However, at BSTP concentrations
of 80 g/L and higher, smooth and even coatings were formed which covered
the scales of fibers, and fibers were bonded together. The results
are consistent with the decrease in shrinkage that was observed with
an increase in the concentration of BSTP.

wool fabric (a) and also wool fabric treated with 20 g/L (b), 40 g/L
(c), 60 g/L (d), 80 g/L (e), and 100 g/L (f) BSTP.

Mechanical Properties of the Treated Wool
Fabrics
The tensile strength and elongation at the peak of
control and wool fabric treated with various concentrations of BSTP
are shown in Figure 4. It is evident that all the treatments increased the tensile strength
of the treated fabrics but the level of increase in the tensile strength
is quite small. The average tensile strength shown by the control
fabric was 14.8 MPa, which increased to 15.7 MPa for the wool fabric
treated with 100 g/L of BSTP. Similarly, the elongation at peak also
increased with an increase in the BSTP concentrations. The control
and the treated fabrics both showed quite good extensibility. The
elongation at peak increased from 36.75% for the control to 48.91%
for the wool fabric treated with 100 g/L of BSTP. In summary, the
tensile strength and the elongation at break increased with an increase
in the concentration of BSTP.

Figure 4 Effect of BSTP concentration on the tensile
strength and the elongation at break of the coated wool fabrics.

Usually, the fabric coated with
a polymer shows an improved tensile strength due to the reinforcement
but the elongation is decreased as the extensibility of the fabrics
is limited by the bonded polymeric coating. However, in our case,
we observed that the BSTP coating increased the elongation of fabric,
which increased with an increase in the concentration of BSTP. The
results suggest that the BSTP formed an elastomeric coating on the
surface of fiber resulting in increasing the elongation of the fabric.

Contact Angle of the Surface of the Treated Wool Fabrics
Figure 5 shows the
shape and contact angle of water droplets placed on the surface of
wool fabrics treated with various concentrations of BSTP and detailed
results are shown in Table 3. The contact angle shown by the control wool fabric was 120.6°
at 0 s which only marginally decreased with an increase in time suggesting
that it is reasonably hydrophobic. The contact angle observed for
the control wool fabric is consistent with the contact angle shown
by untreated wool fabric reported in other published literature.28,29 It can be seen that only in the case of control fabric, the contact
angle only marginally reduced after 40 s, showing good hydrophobicity.
On the other hand, all the treated fabrics showed moderate to good
hydrophilicity as the contact angle proportionally decreased with
an increase in the concentration of BSTP. In the case of wool fabric
treated with 20 g/L, the contact angle became 0 after 30 s, whereas
for the wool fabrics treated with 40 and 60 g/L, the contact angle
went down to 0 after 20 s of the test. For higher than 60 g/L concentrations,
the contact angle became 0 after 10 s of test showing excellent hydrophilicity.
The results show that the BSTP coating made wool fabric highly hydrophilic.

Dyeability of BSTP-Treated
Wool Fabrics
The reflectance vs wavelength curves of wool
fabric dyed with three acid dyes are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the reflectance curves
of the dyed fabrics show a trend, and the reflectance values increased
with an increase in the applied concentration of BSTP at the wavelength
of maximum absorption for each particular dye. The CIE L*a*b* values and color strength
of control and BSTP-treated wool fabrics dyed with three acid dyes
are shown in Table 4. It can be seen that the lightness value (L*) of
the dyed fabrics for all three dyes increased with the increase in
the concentration of BSTP suggesting that the depth of the shade decreased
with an increase in the concentration of BSTP. Similarly, for all
three dyes, the color strength value also decreased with an increase
in the BSTP concentration. The highest color strength was shown by
the control fabric for all dyes indicating that the control dyed fabric
produced the deepest shade. The color strength of control wool fabric
dyed with Tectilon Red F2G, Tectilon Blue GRL, and Tectilon Yellow
2G was 12.26, 12.46, and 11.29 respectively, which decreased to 11.52,
11.75, and 9.89 respectively.

The wool fabric treated
with 100 g/L shows the lowest color strength of all the three dyes
investigated. The results indicate that the color strength of the
stained fabric is related to the applied concentration of BSTP, which
decreased with an increase in the applied BSTP concentration. The
increase in the concentration of BSTP adversely affects the dyeability
of wool, although the level of change in color strength compared to
the control fabric dyed with the same dyes was small.

Stain Resistance
of Treated Wool Fabrics
The stain resistance of control wool
fabrics and also wool fabrics treated with various concentrations
of BSTP against an acid dye-based stain is shown in Figure 7. The blank-treated control
fabric showed very poor stain resistance as the intensity of the color
of the stain was high. The spreading of the staining agent was restricted
to a circle to the size of the stain applicator in a limited area,
as the surface of the control wool fabric is quite hydrophobic. On
the other hand, for the BSTP-treated fabrics, the stain spread all
over the fabrics because of their increased hydrophilicity with an
increase in the BSTP concentrations, which is evident by the low water
contact angle data. The increase in the hydrophilicity increased the
stain release properties of the fabric, and therefore the stain resistance
against the acid dye-based stain increased with an increase in the
concentration of BSTP. The control fabric showed the poorest stain
resistance as the color difference (ΔE) between
the stained and unstained control fabric is very high (59.84) as shown
in Table 5. However,
for the BSTP-coated fabrics, the value of color difference considerably
decreased in comparison with the control fabric. In the case of BSTP-treated
fabrics, the color difference (ΔE) between
the stained and unstained samples decreased from 59.84 for the control
to 45.29 and 40.35 for the fabric treated with 20 and 100 g/L BSTP,
respectively. Therefore, the stain resistance of the treated fabrics
decreased with an increase in the BSTP concentration.

However,
wool fabrics treated with BSTP showed mixed results against the red
wine stain compared to the stain resistance observed against C.I.
Acid Red 40 as shown in Figure 8. At lower concentrations of BSTP, the stain resistance of
wool fabric against red wine was worsened compared to the control
fabric but improved with an increase in the concentrations. The wool
fabric treated with 20 g/L BSTP showed quite a poor stain resistance
against red wine compared to the control fabric as the color difference
increased from 31.22 for the control to 39.53 for the treated fabric.
The increase in the BSTP concentration from 40 to 80 g/L decreased
the color difference value but it was still higher than the color
difference value shown by the control fabric. The wool fabric treated
with 100 g/L BSTP only slightly decreased the color difference value
compared to the control fabric. The application of BSTP negatively
affected the stain resistance of wool fabric against red wine.

performance against red wine of control wool fabric (C) and also wool
fabrics treated with 20 g/L (S1), 40 g/L (S2), 60 g/L (S3), 80 g/L
(S4), and 100 g/L (S5) BSTP.

The red wine contains several polyphenols including anthocyanidin
and tannin, and also the natural pigments of the skin of the grapes
dissolved in the ethyl alcohol.30 The treatment
with BSTP affected wool fabric’s natural resistance against
red wine and the stain resistance decreased when the fabric was treated
with a low concentration of BSTP. However, the stain-resist performance
increased with an increase in the concentration of BSTP. The effect
of BSTP coating of wool fabrics on stain resistance of wool fabrics
was considerably less compared to the other polymers [such as poly(chlorohydroxypropyl-diethylene
adipamide ammonium chloride) or Hercosett 125] used for the shrink
resistance of wool fabrics.4

Discussion
The coating treatment with BSTP increased the tensile strength
and decreased the shrinkage of wool fabric during laundering. The
coating formed on the wool fiber surface by BSTP contributed to the
strength of the untreated fiber as reinforcement. The SEM images of
wool fabrics coated with BSTP (Figure 3) show that at lower concentrations of BSTP, the increase
in tensile strength and the shrink-resist performance of wool fabrics
were quite low up to 40 g/L of BSTP as no inter-fiber bonding formed
at that concentration and the reinforcement by coating of fibers with
BSTP played the major role in increasing the tensile strength. However,
at 60 g/L and above, a very uniform coating of BSTP was formed on
wool fibers, and also the fibers were bonded together by the BSTP
coating as shown in Figure 3. The inter-fiber bonding did not permit the movement of wool
fibers, and therefore the tensile strength, as well as the shrink-resist
performance, increased with an increase in the concentration of BSTP.

It can be seen that the stain resistance against the C.I. Acid
Red 40, as well as the hydrophilicity of wool fabrics, increased with
an increase in the BSTP concentrations. The surface tension of water,
ethyl alcohol, and the wool fiber surface are 72.8, 22.39, and 30.95
mN/m respectively.31 Therefore, it is much
easier for ethyl alcohol to wet the wool fiber surface compared to
water. From Tables 1 and 3, it can be seen that the time required
to wet the fabric and the water contact angle of the surface of wool
fabrics decreased with an increase in the concentrations of BSTP.
However, an increase in the hydrophilic groups on the wool fabric
surface by an increase in the concentration of BSTP should progressively
increase the surface tension of the fiber. Therefore, the wettability
by ethanol should be decreased and the stain resistance of wool fabric
against red wine should increase with an increase in the concentration
of BSTP. However, polyphenols are anionic but the wool fiber surface
is strongly cationic at a pH below 5. The thin coating of weakly anionic
BSTP formed on the wool fiber surface can only slightly reduce the
cationic charge of the surface of wool fibers at these conditions.
Therefore, at lower concentrations, BSTP coating cannot prevent the
adsorption of polyphenols into the wool fiber. When red wine is left
in air for 48 h for the stain-resist test, under aerobic conditions
bacteria in the wine slowly converts ethyl alcohol into acetic acid,31 which reduces the pH of the red wine, and therefore
the adsorption of polyphenol into wool fiber increased as the pH of
the red wine decreased. It is known that wool fiber can electrostatically
bind polyphenols.32 Therefore, the increase
in the wettability of the treated fabric in water did not increase
their stain release properties either, resulting in a decrease in
the stain resistance against red wine with an increase in the concentration
of BSTP.

In the case of the acid dye-based stain, the increase
in the hydrophilicity of wool fiber with an increase in the concentration
of BSTP should increase the wettability of wool fabric by the aqueous
acid dye-based stain, and therefore more staining acid dye should
be absorbed into the fiber, thereby decreasing the stain resistance.
Although acid dyes are strongly anionic, BSTP also forms an anionic
surface layer on the fiber surface, which prevents the penetration
of acid dyes into the interior of the fiber. The increase in the hydrophilicity
of the fiber with an increase in the concentration of BSTP increased
the stain release properties of the fabric as the fabric became easier
to wash by water and the penetration of the staining dye was limited
near the surface of the fibers. Therefore, the stain resistance of
the treated wool fabrics increased with an increase in the BSTP concentration.
In summary, the treatment with BSTP positively affected wool fabric’s
stain resistance against C.I. Acid Red 40 but negatively affected
stain resistance against red wine, especially at lower concentrations.

Table 4 shows that
the color strength of wool fabrics treated with BSTP decreased with
an increase in its concentration. The BSTP contains weakly anionic
hydroxyl groups and also the unreacted anionic Bunte salt groups that
together affect the dyeing of wool with anionic acid dyes. Therefore,
for all acid dyes investigated in this work, the depth of shade produced
on the dyed fabrics decreased with an increase in the concentration
of BSTP.

Conclusions
The effect of the coating
of wool fabric with a BSTP on its dyeability, shrink resistance, mechanical
properties, felting, and stain resistance was systematically evaluated.
It was found that the treated fabric showed very good shrink resistance
and very little felting tendency compared to the blank-treated control
fabric. The shrink-resist performance improved with an increase in
the concentration of BSTP. The treated fabric showed better whiteness
and lesser yellowness compared to the control fabric. The BSTP coating
had a positive effect on the tensile strength, breaking tenacity and
elongation at break, and negatively affected the flexural rigidity
and bending modulus of the treated wool fabric. The hydrophobic wool
fabric surface became quite hydrophilic with the coating with BSTP,
which increased with an increase in the concentration of BSTP. The
treated fabric showed better stain resistance against C.I. Acid Red
40 but had little effect on the stain resistance against red wine,
especially at high concentrations. These findings will help to develop
a polymeric resin for providing shrink resistance to wool fabrics
that will not affect the dyeability of wool fibers negatively.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The wool fabric used was a 2/2 twill woven
of 210 g/m2 having 34 ends/cm and 24 picks/cm. The BSTP
used in this work is a commercial product called ‘Securlana
K’, which is a 40% aqueous solution of sodium salt of glycerol
tri(polypropyleneoxide)ether tris(sulfothioglycolate), and it was
purchased from Pulcra Chemicals (Germany). Hostapal MRN (a wetting
agent) and Sandoclean PC (a non-ionic detergent) were procured from
Clariant Chemicals (Switzerland). Sodium sulfite, acetic acid, and
sodium acetate were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals. Albegal FFA,
a defoaming and leveling agent was supplied by BASF Chemicals (Germany).
The standard phosphate-free detergent used for the shrink resistance
of wool fabric was purchased from the Society of Dyers and Colorists
(SDC), U.K. Three acid dyes, Tectilon Red F2G (C.I. Acid Red 337),
Tectilon Blue GRL (C.I. Acid Blue 25), and Tectilon Yellow 2G (C.I.
Acid Yellow 17) were purchased from Huntsman Chemicals Inc. for evaluating
the dyeability of the BSTP-treated wool fabrics.

Pretreatment
of Wool Fabrics
Lubricants are sprayed on wool fibers during
the spinning process to reduce the damage of fiber due to the friction
with various metallic parts of the spinning machine, which remains
in the fiber even after weaving. Therefore, prior to the coating with
BSTP, the wool fabric was scoured with a 2 g/L Sandoclean PC at 50
°C for 20 min using a 9-L capacity Vald Henriksen dyeing machine
to remove the spinning lubricants. The fabric was then rinsed once
in warm water at 45 °C and rinsed several times with cold water
to completely remove the used detergent from the fiber.

Treatment of
Wool Fabric with BSTP
Wool fabrics were soaked in aqueous
solutions of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 g/L BSTP containing 0.25 g/L
Hostapal MRN and 15 g/L sodium sulfite for 5 min. The wet fabrics
were then passed through the two squeeze rollers of a padding mangle
at 2 m/min speed and at 3.4 kPa pressure. The schematic diagram of
the treatment of wool fabric with BSTP is shown in Figure 9. The treated fabrics were
then dried at 90 °C for 3 min followed by curing at 140 °C
for 3 min. They were then washed with hot water (60 °C) followed
by rinsing with cold water until the pH of the water became neutral.
After which, the treated fabrics were dried at 60 °C for 30 min.

Characterization of BSTP-Treated
Wool fabric
The untreated and BSTP-treated wool fabrics were
characterized by various methods as mentioned below.

Assessment
of Shrink Resistance, Felting, Wettability, and Color Change
The shrink resistance measurement was carried out according to the
Woolmark Test Method TM 31. In this method, the wool fabric samples
were repeatedly washed five times according to the Woolmark 5A washing
protocol at 50 °C for 60 min using three different concentrations
of standard phosphate-free detergent (SDC detergent) in a Wascator
(SDL Atlas, Rock Hill), using a liquor ratio of 1:20. The washed fabrics
were dried and their dimensions were measured compared to the original
dimension of the fabric samples to quantify the felting shrinkage
and shrink resistance performance. Felting of fabric samples was visually
evaluated. The whiteness and yellowness indices were spectrophotometrically
assessed by using a hand-held spectrometer (model: 45/0, BYK-GARDNER
GmbH, Geretsried, Germany). The wettability of the control and BSTP-treated
wool fabrics was evaluated after conditioning the samples in the standard
atmospheric conditions (20 ± 2 °C and 65 ± 2% relative
humidity) for 48 h according to the AATCC Test Method 39-1998: Evaluation
of Wettability by placing a droplet of ultrapure water (2.82 mg) on
various fabrics from two cm above. The time taken for the water droplet
to completely disappear is considered as the wettability of the fabric
and the lower value is considered as the better wettability. The samples
were preconditioned under the above-mentioned conditions for 48 h
prior to testing. At least 10 measurements were taken for each fabric
sample and the averages are reported here.

Mechanical Characterization
An Instron Universal Tensile Testing Machine (model 4204, Instron
Testing Systems, Inc., Norwood) was used to measure the tensile strength
and elongation properties of the treated wool fabrics. The measurements
were carried out at 20 °C and 65% relative humidity (RH) according
to the ASTM Test Method D5035-06: A Standard Test Method for Breaking
Force and Elongation of Textile Fabrics (Strip Method). The sample
size was 25.4 × 152.4 mm2, and the gauge length was
100 mm. The samples were conditioned at the above-mentioned conditions
for 3 days before the testing was carried out. At least 10 samples
were tested for each treated fabric and the averages are reported
here. The bending stiffness of the wool fabric treated with various
concentrations of BSTP was carried out using a Shirley Fabric Stiffness
Tester (Shirley Developments Limited, Stockport, U.K.) according to
the ASTM Test Method D1388-14: A Standard Test Method for Stiffness
of Fabrics. The fabric samples were conditioned at 20 ± 2 °C
and 65 ± 2% relative humidity for 48 h and the test was also
carried out at these conditions. The flexural rigidity was calculated
according to the following equation 1  where W = weight of fabric (g)/m2, and C = bending length (mm). The bending modulus was calculated
according to the following equation 2  where G = flexural rigidity (N m) and T = fabric thickness
(mm).

Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(ATR-FTIR)
Infrared studies were used to characterize the
surfaces of the control and BSTP-treated wool fabrics. A PerkinElmer
FTIR (model: System 2000, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham) spectroscopy
was used for recording the FTIR spectra of various fabrics. The spectroscope
was equipped with an ATR attachment and a zinc–selenium (Zn/Se)
crystal. A fabric sample was placed over the Zn/Se crystal and 64
scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1 were performed for
each sample and the averages are reported here.

Contact Angle
Measurement
The contact angle was measured by using a KSV
CAM 100 Contact Angle Measurement Apparatus (KSV Instruments, Helsinki,
Finland) and was calculated by using the Young–Laplace equation.
The contact angle was measured at 10 places for each treatment and
the average contact angle was reported. For each sample, the first
measurement was taken immediately after placing the droplet of water
and then at 10 s interval measurements were taken until 40 s.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy
To assess whether a change in surface
scales of wool fiber took place during the treatment with BSTP, the
treated fabrics were scanned under a Hitachi scanning electron microscope
(model: TM3030 Plus, Hitachi Corporation, Japan) at 15 kV. The fabric
samples were scanned without any conductive coating.

Evaluation
of Dyeability
The dyeability of the fabric was evaluated
by dyeing the control fabric and BSTP-treated fabric samples with
three acid dyes, namely Tectilon Blue GRL, Tectilon Yellow 2G, and
Tectilon Red F2G at 2% on the weight of the fiber (owf). All dyeings
were carried out in an Ahiba laboratory dyeing machine (model: Turbomat
1000, Datacolor International, Switzerland) using tap water and with
a material to liquor ratio of 1:30. The dye bath was prepared with
the required quantity of dye, 10% owf sodium sulfate (as an electrolyte),
1.0 g/L Albegal FFA, and 0.25 g/L Sandozin MRN. Five grams of fabric
was cut from the control fabric as well as from each treated fabric,
and all of them were dyed in the same bath to compare their dyeability.
The pH was adjusted to 4.7 with acetic acid and sodium acetate solution.
The bath was then heated from ambient room temperature at 2 °C/min
to 98 °C and held for 60 min followed by cooling at 2 °C/min
to 40 °C. The bath was then dropped, the dyed samples were rinsed
in warm water (60 °C) for 15 min, and then also with cold water
for two times to remove the dyes adsorbed to the surface of wool fibers.
The fabric samples were then dried and various color measurements
were carried out.

Color Measurement
The color measurements
of wool fabrics dyed with three acid dyes were carried out under illuminant
D65, using a 10° standard observer with UV component and specular
excluded by using a Datacolor reflectance spectrophotometer (model:
Spectraflash SF 600, Datacolor International, Switzerland) interfaced
to a personal computer.33 The reflectance
values of the dyed samples were measured at the appropriate wavelength
of the maximum absorption for each dye and the color strength (K/S) was measured according to the Kubelka–Munk
equation. The samples were folded three times and four measurements
were made on each sample. The average value is reported here. The
color difference was calculated by measuring CIE L*, a*, b* color difference (ΔE) at different places of each dyed fabric under illuminant
D65, using a 10° standard observer by a BYK-Gardner Spectro-Guide
45/0 gloss Color Spectrophotometer (BYK-GARDNER, Germany).

Evaluation
of Stain Resistance
The stain resistance of the control and
treated wool fabrics was assessed according to the AATCC Test Method
175-2008 Stain resistance: Pile Floor Coverings against C.I. Acid
Red 40 and red wine staining agents. For each treatment, two samples
of 100 × 100 mm2 size were used. The samples were
conditioned at the standard atmospheric conditions (65 ± 2% RH,
20 ± 2 °C) for 24 h. For blank staining, distilled water
with a pH of 2.8 ± 1.0 (adjusted by citric acid) was used. One
fabric sample was blank-stained and two samples were stained with
either C.I. Acid Red 40 or red wine. The stain applicator was placed
at the center of a fabric sample, and then 20 mL of C.I. Acid Red
40 solution or red wine into the center of the applicator. The top
of the stain applicator was pressed with the flat of the inside of
the hand. The applicator was carefully removed and the stained fabric
samples were left in the conditioned room for 24 h, then rinsed under
running tap water, dried in an oven at 80 °C and returned to
the conditioned room. Color measurements of unstained and stained
samples were carried out with a Mahlo spectrophotometer (under D65
illuminant and 10° observer). For each treatment, three samples
were examined and the averages are reported here.
