Coffee
husks represent about 12 wt % of coffee grains, generating
a significant impact on the environment because of its inadequate
disposal. In Colombia, this waste presents an energy resource opportunity
equivalent to over 49,106 TJ per year. However, several challenges
related to this type of biomass, such as the moisture content, the
irregular shapes, and the low bulk density, make its use difficult
in current burners. Thus, in this paper, the combustion of coffee
husk pellets was studied in detail to design a high-efficiency burner
to produce energy for coffee drying. The pellets were prepared in
a pelletizer with 15% moisture and 20% yield and burned in a bench-scale
lateral reactor to determine the energy density. It was found that
the combustion properties of coffee husk depend on the specifics of
the pelleting process. The energy density values were Iv = 0.789 MW/m3 and Ig = 0.007 MW/m2, which could be used to design the
combustion chamber for coffee husk burning.

==== Body
Introduction
The use of biomass for the generation
of thermal energy can contribute
positively to a series of common political objectives, including increasing
the use of renewable energies, reducing pollution emissions, and complying
with environmental regulations.1 Additionally,
it can encourage economic development in communities dependent on
the agricultural and forestry sectors. Consequently, in countries
whose economies are based on agriculture, the use of biomass energy
could be a solution for the final disposal of this type of waste and
contribute to the generation of energy from alternative technologies.

In Colombia, around 72 million tons of agricultural residual biomass
are produced annually, of which 193,460 tons correspond to coffee
husk,2 an energy opportunity equivalent
to 49,106 TJ per year.3 In recent years,
the studies related to coffee husk have increased, and some of these
investigations are focused on the development of dense products for
combustion applications.4−6 However, the aim of this study
is to evaluate the coffee husk combustion.

Kang et al.7 investigated the combustion
characteristics of spent coffee beans and wood pellets. In their study,
they found that the energy potential of spent coffee beans was higher
than that of wooden pellets because spent coffee beans have a higher
hydrogen content. In addition, the authors evaluated the combustion
in a 6.5 kWth boiler and quantified the combustion gases, obtaining
concentrations of 17.8% O2, 643 ppm CO, and 163 ppm NOx. These values indicate that the combustion
was incomplete; therefore, the authors concluded that it was necessary
to optimize the design of the boiler so that the combustion would
be carried out properly and pollution emissions reduced.

Limousy
et al.8 carried out the evaluation
of the combustion of wood pellets, spent coffee pellets, and a mixture
of pellets of both biomasses. In their study, they found that the
combustion of the spent coffee pellets generated higher CO and NOx emissions than those of both the wooden pellets
and the biomass mixture. Moran et al.9 investigated
different mixtures of biomass pellets and municipal waste to obtain
good combustion efficiency and lower emissions. Their study found
that the optimal mixture contained 20% waste and 80% biomass with
a greater than 1.6 air ratio. Verma et al.10 measured the CO, NOx, SOx, and CxHy emissions of the combustion of various biomass pellets
in a 40 kWth boiler, including wood, apple, grass, and sunflower seeds.
They found that the main parameters that must be considered for the
proper use of agro-pellets in small-scale combustion equipment were
the ash content and the low melting temperature.

Additionally,
Guo and Zhong11 studied
the combustion of pellets of amento compounds, wood residues, rice,
and coal residues by both thermogravimetric and fluidized bed analyses
to optimize the oxidation processes. The authors found that the ideal
mixing ratio of the composite pellets to coal was 30%:70%, respectively,
resulting in minimal activation energy and a reduced amount of alkali
metals that potentially cause slagging problems.

Furthermore,
in the literature, it is possible to find studies
focused on the determination of the ignition temperature of various
biomasses at different heating rates.12−14 Magalhães et
al.12 found that ignition occurred in the
gas phase because of the content of volatile material, where the volatile
low-density material caused ignition regardless of the rate of heating
used. Riaza et al.13 analyzed various factors
to determine the ignition temperature of biomass in the form of a
pellet. This study considered the heating rate and other parameters
such as particle sizes, operating temperatures, and oxygen concentrations,
finding that the biomasses showed a greater susceptibility to autoignition
compared to the lignite coals.

Moreover, studies have been carried
out to determine the ignition
temperature of varying mixtures of coal and biomass to utilize the
waste material through co-combustion, reduce the ignition temperature,
and reduce the generation of NOx.13,15−17 In these investigations, geometric methods from the
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry
(DTG) graphs are mainly used. In other works, biomasses such as bagasse,
bamboo, pine, olive, flower peel, almond peel, and olive residues12,14,18 were studied, and the ignition
temperatures between 290 and 320 °C were calculated. However,
these studies did not analyze the differences in the reactivity of
the biomasses and the technical implications for the design of the
combustion chamber.

In the literature reviewed, there are no
reported works on the
development of biomass pellet combustion equipment, and generally,
the designers use design parameters obtained from coal combustion
studies but are not from biomass combustion studies. Therefore, we
will show a complete study of coffee husk combustion by analyzing
the main differences between the combustion of the aggregate and disaggregated
material, the combustion time residence, and the effect of pelletizing
on the combustion process.

Results and Discussion
The maximum
temperature of the coffee husk during combustion was
751 °C for the disaggregated material form and 761 °C for
the pellet form (see Figure 1). These values are higher than the furnace set temperature
as a consequence of the exothermic reactions that characterize the
oxidation of organic materials.

Figure 1 Temperatures and CO2 concentrations
during combustion.

The heating rate can
be observed in Figure 1; the differences may be due to the ignition
temperature of the coffee husk (280 °C), as will be discussed
later. When this temperature was exceeded, the disaggregated material
exhibited both greater oxidation rate and higher production of carbon
dioxide as compared with the pelleted material because of the distribution
of the original material where the layer of coffee husk is more joined.

It can also be seen in Figure 1 that with the completion of the combustion process,
as indicated by the CO2 concentration reducing close to
zero, the temperature of the disaggregated material was recorded to
be at the oven temperature. Because of the thermocouple being uncovered,
it may have directly recorded the oven temperature. On the other hand,
the thermocouple was inserted inside the pelleted sample. In this
case, the recorded temperature was lower than the oven temperature
after completion of the combustion process. This may be the result
of the pellet reduced temperature because of secondary endothermic
reactions (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Differential scanning calorimetry at various operation times.

Figure 2 shows that,
initially, endothermic reactions occur due to the humidity present
in the material, and subsequently, exothermic reactions occur due
to the oxidation of the material. At 20 min of combustion, the results
indicate that the biomass had only partially oxidized. At 60 min of
combustion, an endothermic peak indicates possible secondary reactions
after oxidation of the coffee husk, which are distinct from the endothermic
reactions because of the initial drying process. These secondary reactions
occurred at 120 °C.

On the other hand, the adiabatic flame
temperature was determined
by an energy balance of heat capacity variation with respect to combustion
gas temperature. The flame temperature results were determined under
stoichiometric conditions and with 40% excess air, which is the recommended
value found in the literature for solid fuels.22,23 Under stoichiometric conditions, the flame temperature was 1827
K (1624 °C), and under excess air conditions, the temperature
was 1400 K (1127 °C). With a higher percentage of excess air,
the volume of the combustion gases will increase, and therefore, the
flame temperature will decrease. Table 1 shows the proximate and ultimate analyses of coffee
husk.

The ignition temperature of the
material was determined using graphical
analysis of the thermogravimetric study of the sample, following the
methodology of Li et al.15 For the tests
in the TGA, a heating rate of 10 K/min was defined as reported in
the literature.15,18,24 The graphical method consists of (1) drawing a vertical line at
the point of maximum mass loss rate (point P), (2) drawing a tangent
line at the intersection (point Q) of the mass loss curve (TGA in Figure 3), (3) drawing a
tangent line on the first stage (drying) on the TGA curve, and (4)
finally, drawing a vertical line at the intersection (point R) of
the lines drawn from steps (2) and (3), indicating the ignition temperature
on the base axis (see Figure 3). On the basis of this methodology, it was determined that
the ignition temperature of the coffee husk is 280 °C, which
is within the range of ignition temperatures reported for different
biomasses in the literature.12,14,18

Figure 3 Ignition
temperature of the coffee husk from TGA data.

The results of the combustion tests are presented in Figure 4, where the primary
coffee
husk pyrolysis stage and subsequent oxidation of the char can be distinguished.

Figure 4 Combustion
curves of (A) disaggregated material and (B) pelletized
material.

The drying stage is the first
stage of the biomass combustion process.
However, in the present experiments, this stage was not detectable
due to the low moisture content of the samples (∼ 9.5%). Inserting
the sample holder into the oven at 700 °C resulted in a high
rate of drying, causing the water to evaporate and be forced out of
the particle before devolatilization. With the drying of the sample,
its temperature increases causing decomposition and the release of
volatiles. The flow of volatiles out of the sample during devolatilization
does not allow oxygen to reach its pores, resulting in pyrolysis.

The presence of H2, CO2, H2S,
O2, C2H6, CH4, C2H4, CO, and C3H8 species was measured
using a gas chromatograph during the devolatilization stage as the
oxygen concentration decreased, as well as during the subsequent char
oxidation stage where the carbon monoxide on the sample surface reacted
with the oxygen, generating carbon dioxide.

The pyrolysis stage
lasted 3 min for the disaggregated material
and 7 min for the agglomerated material. This difference occurs due
to the fact that the pelleted material has a layer of the coffee husk
joined together by means of mechanical interlocking, causing the material
to oxidize more slowly. On the other hand, the disaggregated material
has more space between layers of coffee husks, allowing the reaction
to proceed more rapidly.

The resulting char, which forms at
the end of the devolatilization
process, is highly porous because of the spaces generated by the volatiles
escaping the sample during the previous stage. Because of this porosity,
air can diffuse into the sample during this stage. The resulting char
oxidation times were 16 min for the disaggregated material and 21
min for the agglomerated material.

The sample power release
rates per unit of volume and area were
calculated using the oxidation times of the experimental tests, as
well as the volume and area projected by the sample in the horizontal
oven as determined before inserting the sample into the kiln. Iv and Ig were calculated
using eqs 1 and 2. The results are presented in Table 2. The energy of the material was calculated
using a lower calorific value of 15.8 MJ/kg, which does not depend
on the geometry of the sample material, because the low heating value
is an intensive property of the material.

Table 2 Power Release
Rates per Unit Area
and Unit Volume

Iv (MW/m3)	0.3732	0.7895	
Ig (MW/m2)	0.0032	0.0069	
The specific power corresponds to 0.3732 MW/m3 of the
chamber for the disaggregated material and 0.7895 MW/m3 of the chamber for the agglomerated material. This indicates that
the pelletized coffee husk could release more power in a fixed volume
than the disaggregated material because there is more material in
the pellet form than in the disaggregated form in the same volume,
which implies more available energy for releasing in the combustion
process. These differences between the pelletized and disaggregated
materials are only due to the difference in space required for the
combustion inside the combustion chamber because the HHV is the same
for both cases.

To obtain a given power output requirement,
the necessary combustion
chamber volume for burning coffee husk in a disaggregated form is
2.1 times larger than that for pellets. Additionally, the bulk density
of the pelleted material (614 kg/m3) is nearly three times
greater than that of the disaggregated material (213 kg/m3). Consequently, the volume occupied by the agglomerated material
is almost one-third that of the disaggregated material, indicating
that equipment operating with coffee husk pellets could be more compact.
Regarding the power release rate per unit of the grid area, the energy
density of the pellets is three times higher than that of the disaggregated
material. Consequently, combustion equipment for the pelleted material
can be designed with three times smaller grid areas.

The specific
power per unit volume of the disaggregated coffee
husk used in this work was found to be below the range of 0.47–9
MW/m3, as reported by other authors for other solid fuels.20,22 The specific power per unit of grid area was also found to be below
the range of 0.74–1.7 MW/m2 for bituminous coal
in a fixed grid, as reported by other authors.20,22 These discrepancies in specific power are mainly due to the thermal
properties of the compared fuels, such as calorific value and density,
which result in the superior energy performance of fossil fuels, such
as coal. The discrepancies can also be attributed to the various combustion
stages that occur, considering that devolatilization occurs as the
first stage, followed by oxidation of the char at a later stage. The
reaction rate depends on the stage of the combustion process, which
leads to the varying reactivity of each stage. Biomass fuels may possibly
be more reactive than fossil fuels during the devolatilization stage
because of the easy oxidation of the gaseous compounds, providing
energy for the combustion of char.

Further combustion tests
were carried out on a pilot scale. The
quantities of comburent and fuel were determined based on the capacity
of the feeding system. During 1 h testing runs, 1.2 kg of the disaggregated
coffee husk was used compared to 1.6 kg of the agglomerated coffee
husk. Figure 5 presents
the results of the gas monitoring in the pilot tests.

Figure 5 Pollutant emissions during
the combustion of coffee husk in pilot
tests.

The limiting reagent in both test
cases was the coffee husk. The
pollutant concentration increased during the feeding of the biomass
and decreased once the material was consumed (Figure 8). The concentration of sulfur oxides remained
low during combustion because of the very low sulfur content (0.05%)
of the coffee husk. Sulfur dioxide can be produced by the decomposition
of CaSO4 at temperatures greater than 1200 °C;11,25 however, in the present tests, the temperature of the equipment
was well below this threshold. Nitrogen oxide emissions were around
180 ppm during the combustion of the material at a pilot scale.

The formation of NO is mainly due to the oxidation of nitrogen
at temperatures below 1000 °C. The NO can be generated by both
homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions.11,25 As the concentration of nitrogen in the biomass was very low (0.04%),
the NO measured during the present tests was predominantly formed
because of the process temperature. The difference between both results
is mainly due to the disaggregated material reaches the combustion
process and releases pollutant emissions more quickly than the pelletized
material, which is due to the material distribution in the combustion
chamber.

Conclusions
On the basis of experimental combustion
tests, the flame temperature
of the coffee husk was found to be 1624 °C, whereas the ignition
temperature was found to be 280 °C, a value that is consistent
with the ignition temperatures of biomasses reported in the literature.
The pelleted material form increased the oxidation time compared to
the disaggregated material because of the lack of surface area in
the agglomerated form. The pelletized coffee husk required an average
time of 21 min to fully oxidize, whereas the disaggregated form required
an average time of 16 min.

This work presents the first known
measure of the combustion characteristics
of coffee husk in both its disaggregated and pelleted forms, informing
the design criteria of future coffee husk combustion equipment. The
parameters of power released per unit volume and per unit area were
calculated experimentally for coffee husk, resulting in Iv = 0.3732 MW/m3 and Ig= 0.0032 MW/m2 for the disaggregated material and Iv = 0.7895 MW/m3 and Ig = 0.0069 MW/m2 for the pelleted material.
These values can facilitate the proper sizing of the combustion chamber.
The methodology used in this research allows for the measurement of
the parameters associated with the power released per unit of both
volume and area for different biomasses, which are fundamental for
the design of a suitable combustion chamber. It was determined that
the combustion of the disaggregated coffee husk requires a combustion
chamber volume and a grid area of 2.1 times greater than that required
by the combustion of pelletized coffee husk for an equivalent performance
characteristic.

Experimental Section
The adiabatic
flame temperature and ignition temperature of coffee
husk in both disaggregated and agglomerated formats were determined.
The adiabatic flame temperature was measured in a combustion chamber
by using an energy balance under stoichiometric conditions and with
excess air. Samples were taken from the coffee husk to subject the
material to elemental analysis and proximate analysis in EXETER brand
model CE-440 using the ASTM D5373 standard and in TGA Linseis brand
model STA PT-1600.

The ignition temperature was determined by
means of thermogravimetric
analysis in TGA Linseis brand model STA PT-1600. The thermogravimetric
analysis was performed with 13 ± 0.01 mg of samples at a heating
rate of 10 K/min in an atmosphere of mixed N2/O2 (50/13 mL/min). The ignition temperature was determined from the
mass loss curve by plotting the three segments with the most significant
changes and contrasting with the curve of the mass loss derivative.

The study of the combustion of coffee husk was carried out by means
of experimental tests in a lateral oven bench scale (see Figure 6). The tests were
performed using 1.8 g of the sample material at a time. The reaction
zone is 30 cm long, wrapped with electrical resistance for heating
the quartz tube measuring 3.5 cm in diameter and 64 cm in length,
where the material to be studied was placed. The sample was weighed
before and after the test and was supported on a quartz sample holder
with a diameter of 2.4 cm and a length of 13 cm. Preliminary tests
were performed to ensure that the air flow used would exceed the friction
losses in the line and traps without disturbing the sample. The flow
of compressed air was set at 1.7 lpm, supplied by a tank lung connected
to a piston-type compressor.

Figure 6 Experimental assembly for the combustion of
coffee husk pellets.

The process temperature was 700 °C as measured on the
outer
surface of the electrical resistance, whereas an internal thermocouple
was used to monitor the temperature of the pellet or the disaggregated
material (see Figure 7). The sample holder with the coffee husk was placed into the reactor
once the oven reached the process temperature. After confirming the
contact between the thermocouple and the sample material, the quartz
tube was sealed, and the flowmeter valve opened to introduce the oxidizing
atmosphere. The gases generated from combustion were passed through
two stages of traps: (1) retaining the tar by direct contact with
isopropyl alcohol and (2) followed by removing moisture by direct
contact with silica gel. These samples were collected in Tedlar bags
and analyzed in an Agilent MicroGC model 3000 gas chromatograph to
quantify the presence of O2, H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and H2S according to Valdés
et al.16 and Montoya et al.19

Figure 7 Thermocouple assembly inside the quartz tube. (A) Disaggregated
material. (B) Pelletized material.

To measure the temperature of the pellet, a perforation was
made
to the agglomerated material using a 1 mm drill, where the tip of
the thermocouple was inserted. Figure 7 shows the position of the thermocouple in the case
of (A) the disaggregated material and (B) the pelleted material.

The energy velocity of the fuel was calculated using eqs 1 and 2, which
relate the power per unit volume and area in the combustion chamber 1   2  where Iv is the fuel empirical
rate of power release per unit volume
of the combustion chamber, V is the volume of the
combustion chamber, m is the amount of material used,
PCI is the lower calorific value of the fuel, Ig is the empirical rate of energy release per unit area of
the grid, and A is the area of the grid. These factors
were calculated using the experimental results of the combustion tests
with agglomerated and disaggregated coffee husk combustion in the
lateral oven.

The oxidation time of the disaggregated and pelletized
materials
was determined using the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the
combustion gases, that is, the end of combustion was defined as when
the percentage of oxygen at the outlet was equal to its concentration
in the input air and when the concentration of carbon dioxide was
zero.

Additionally, the power release rate of the fuel per unit
volume
and area was calculated from the volume and area projected of the
material in the oven, the volume projected was related with the length
of the material inside the sample holder and the area of the quartz
tube, and the area projected was related with the length of the material
inside the sample holder and diameter of the quartz tube. This values
compared with the general values reported in the literature,20−22 this indicator allows to define the size of the combustion chamber
easily.

Finally, pilot-scale tests were carried out to analyze
the pollutant
emissions generated during the combustion of both the agglomerated
and disaggregated materials. Four experiments were carried out with
1.2 kg/h of pelleted material and disaggregated material, guaranteeing
a flow of 200 lpm of a comburent, according to the feeding system
of the reactor. Figure 8 illustrates the experimental setup.

Figure 8 Experimental
assembly at pilot scale.

The comburent flow was provided by compressed air from a
lung tank,
controlled using digital flowmeter OMEGA brand reference FMA5400/5500.
Samples of combustion gases were collected and analyzed for O2, H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and H2S content using the previously mentioned gas chromatograph,
as well as NOx and SO2 content
using a Bacharach brand portable gas analyzer.
