Considering the risks
of hydrothermal deterioration in vehicles,
power plants, and oceangoing vessels, V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalysts were subject to hydrothermal and
thermal aging at 600, 625, 635, and 650 °C for 4–48 h.
The different ratio and significant loss of active sites are main
reasons for catalyst deactivation. Both Lewis and Brønsted acid
sites are involved in the selective catalytic reduction reaction.
Brønsted acid sites are more susceptible. High temperature plays
a major role in the aging. It causes sintering, particle growth, and
the anatase phase transition. Phase transformation turns out to be
less important than sintering. Sintering leads to the reduction of
the BET surface area, which in turn causes decrease of NH3 adsorption amount and changes of active sites. Aging time can accelerate
the degree of deactivation. It also helps to change the proportion
of active sites. Water vapor has no significant effect on NOX conversion rates.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology has evolved
a lot in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and economics1 to reduce NOX in
diesel vehicles, power plants, and more than 90% of oceangoing vessels.2 To meet the growing demand for SCR technology
due to more stringent emission legislation, two main types of SCR
catalysts occupied are vanadium and zeolite catalysts. In the past
decades, the commercial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst of SCR has been proven to have good catalytic activity
and selectivity, excellent resistance to sulfur poisoning,3 good tolerance to lubricant poisoning,4 and lower N2O emission.5 However, poor thermal stability6 and volatilization of vanadium7 have prohibited the vanadia-catalyst from being extensively used.
Thermal stability at temperatures above 600 °C in power plants8 is a problem. Meanwhile, extreme operating points9 and the regeneration of diesel particulate filter
(DPF)10 can result in temperature
above 650 °C. Thus, the challenge for the Vanadia-SCR catalyst
is the hydrothermal durability.

There are many similar studies11−13 focused on hydrothermal
and thermal aging on the vanadia-SCR catalyst. Rasmussen and Abrams14 demonstrated that vanadium tungsten catalyst
was stable under hydrothermal conditions at 550 °C (110 h) and
the deactivation was not due to vanadium evaporation. Xi et al.15 aged the Vanadia-SCR catalyst from 525 to 700
°C for 2 h. Asako et al.10 aged vanadia
catalyst for 100 h at 550 °C and found that it lost 40–60%
activity. Madia et al.9 performed progressive
aging experiments for 100 h at 550 °C and 30 h at 600 °C
and found that 2 wt % V2O5 had the best hydrothermal
stability. Maunula et al.16 deactivated
the catalyst using 10% H2O at 600, 650, 700, 750, and 800
°C for 20 h, and aged coated samples in static furnace conditions
at 600, 650, 700, and 800 °C for 3 h. Li et al.17 aged SCR catalysts at 670 °C for 64 h. Beale et al.18 tested the catalyst at 650 and 700 °C for
20 h in a flow of 10% H2O.

Most existing studies
attribute the deactivation of hydrothermal
and thermal aging to the morphological changes of vanadium and the
reduction in the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface area.
Went et al.19 reported that lower oligomers,
such as monomeric and dimeric vanadia species, had better SCR reactivity
and N2 selectivity. Jin et al.20 and Reddy et al.21 stated that monomeric
vanadyl species gradually converted to crystalline V2O5 during thermal aging. Similar conclusions were supported
by Went et al.,22 Wachs et al.,23 Djerad et al.,24 Beale
et al.,18 Lai and Wachs,25 Madia et al.,9 and other researchers.
Xi et al.15 and Jin et al.20 also mentioned that the decrease in the BET surface area
increased the surface density of vanadia, which may result in the
formation of less active polymeric species and even crystalline V2O5. Nova et al.26 thought
that loss of surface area was the main cause of catalyst deactivation.
Kompio et al.27 had the same opinion. Many
authors also suggested that the decrease in catalytic activity was
attributed to anatase phase transition.16,18,20,28 Sintering of the TiO2 support could lead to aggregation of isolated vanadium ions26 and could increase the polymeric vanadyl surface
species.9 The rutile-supported vanadia
catalyst was substantially less active than the anatase-supported
vanadia catalyst.29

Despite the considerable
studies on hydrothermal aging of vanadium-based
catalysts as described above, there are still some controversial and
insufficient fields. Although there are numbers of active sites studies,25,30,31 few studies have focused on active-site
changes during hydrothermal aging. Literatures32−34 described that
H2O caused a certain degree of activity reduction because
of competitive adsorption of H2O and NH3. However,
the role of H2O in hydrothermal aging has been neglected.
Besides, ammonia storage capacity decreases as aging temperature increases15 and it is facilitated by Brønsted acid
sites.17 Aging leads to a decrease in NH3 storage capacity.10 Therefore,
changes of NH3 storage capacity during hydrothermal aging
needs further study. Furthermore, the reduction in the BET surface
area originates from anatase sintering and phase transition.20,35 Then which of the anatase sintering and phase transition is in closer
contact with catalyst activity.

The main disadvantage of vanadium-based
SCR is the deactivation
at temperatures exceeding 600–650 °C.36 Pure V2O5 has a melting point of
670 °C, which easily leads to sintering of V2O5 particles and a decrease in catalytic activity.37,38 As mentioned by Asako et al.,10 DPF regeneration
raises the SCR inlet temperature to 650 °C. By estimation, this
situation lasts for 50 h throughout the life of the after treatment
system.10 Hence, 650 °C is a particularly
noteworthy aging temperature.

In short, there are many areas
worth further study. Herein, the
commercial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst was thermally aged at 650 °C for 4–24 h in
a step size of 4 h. Hydrothermal aging experiments were carried out
at 650 °C for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, and at 600 °C for 48 h,
at 625 and 635 °C for 24 h. A fixed-bed quartz reactor with standard
gas to simulate diesel exhaust was used. For catalyst characterization,
X-ray diffraction (XRD), in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 adsorption
isotherms, and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD)
experiments were used. The anatase phase transition, sintering of
the carrier, and changes of BET surface area were fully studied. Particularly,
the active-site variations in species and amount were discussed. The
reduction of catalytic activity and the mechanism of hydrothermal
deactivation were clearly explained. Finally, the effects of temperature,
aging time, and H2O during hydrothermal aging were clarified.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalytic Performance
The NOX conversion rates directly reflect
the catalyst
activity. Overall, the DeNOX ability has
dropped dramatically and the temperature window has shrunk massively
during hydrothermal aging. The fresh sample has a very good DeNOX ability and a very wide temperature window,
as shown in the Figure 1a. Its NOX conversion rate can reach
79.06% at 250 °C and 90.4% at 450 °C.

Figure 1 NOX conversion rates evaluated in the
gas flow of 450 ppm NO, 450 ppm NH3, 10% O2,
7.8% H2O, and balance N2 with a space velocity
of 3 × 105 h–1 between 200 and 450
°C; (a) fresh and hydrothermal aging samples, (b) comparisons
of thermal and hydrothermal aging samples deactivated at 650 °C.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of fresh and hydrothermal aging
samples. The rhombus
represents the anatase TiO2 phase, the heart shape represents
the rutile TiO2 phase, and the black dot represents the
WO3 phase.

As shown in Figure S2a, the catalyst
deactivates more rapidly during the first 12 h. At 400 °C, the
NOX conversion rate decreases from 94.97%
of the fresh sample to 63.06% of the T-12 sample. Then the deactivation
degree declines after 12 h. The deactivation degree in the first 12
h is higher than that of subsequent aging. The entire aging process
could be divided into two parts: the fast deactivation stage and the
slow deactivation stage, when samples are thermally aged at the same
temperature. In addition, the active sites that work in high temperature
(mainly around 400 °C) and low temperature (mainly around 250
°C) are different. As can be seen in Figure S2b, the relative deactivation degree of lower temperature
is slightly higher than that of higher temperature. For example, the
relative deactivation degree rises from 40.68% (T-4) to 88.84% (T-24)
at 250 °C, while it rises from 5% (T-4) to 60.54% (T-24) at 400
°C. Aged catalyst samples eventually maintain a NOX conversion rate of about 10% at lower temperatures.

When the aging temperature reaches a certain value, the NOX conversion rate could be very sensitive
to the increase of hydrothermal aging temperature. The temperature
of 635 °C is only 10 °C higher than 625 °C, and 650
°C is only 15 °C higher than 635 °C. However, the highest
conversion rate decreases from 68.25% of sample ht625-24 to 55.36%
of sample ht635-24, and to 36.27% of sample ht650-24. In addition,
the conversion rate of sample ht650-12 is very close to the conversion
rate of sample ht635-24. The sample ht635-24 has a 3% higher conversion
rate at 450 °C. At other temperatures, the differences between
the two samples do not exceed 0.5%. This means that a rise of 15 °C
could save about 12 h of aging when the temperature is high enough.
This conclusion can be confirmed by sample ht600-48. Though the aging
time is up to 48 h, the conversion rate is higher than the sample
aged at 650 °C for 8 h. Particularly, the conversion rate of
sample ht600-48 is 54.36% and sample ht650-8 is 45.66% at 300 °C.
Therefore, the higher the aging temperature, the greater it impacts
the NOX conversion rate.

Many literatures
have pointed out the competitive adsorption of
H2O and NH3,32,34 and the beneficial
effects of H2O on the selectivity of SCR reaction.39 However, few studies have shown how H2O affects hydrothermal aging. H2O has no significant effect
on the conversion rate during hydrothermal aging, as shown in Figure 1b. After 4 h of aging,
the conversion rates of hydrothermally aged sample ht650-4 and the
thermally aged sample T-4 are very close. The biggest difference situates
at 250 °C, and the conversion rate of sample T-4 is 4% higher.
After 12 h of aging, the conversion rate of sample T-12 is about 8%
higher than that of sample ht650-12 at 400 °C. When the aging
time is as long as 24 h, the conversion rates are closer again, and
the maximum difference does not exceed 3.5%. Therefore, it can be
said that H2O has little effect on the conversion rate
of NOX.

2.2 Sintering,
Phase Transition, and BET Surface
Area
Madia et al.9 showed the
relationship between the BET specific surface area and the catalyst
particle size. He stated that BET surface area was consistent with
the calculated anatase particle values before pore clogging. Thus,
the anatase transformation, particle size growth, and BET surface
area of the catalyst were explored.

As shown in Figure 2, the anatase TiO2 phase predominates in all the samples (2θ = 25.26, 37.779,
47.98, 53.88, 55.001, 62.66, 68.741, 70.22, and 75.98, JCPDF, PDF84-1285).
No phase transition occurs at the beginning. With the prolongation
of deactivation time and the increase of hydrothermal temperature,
the presence of rutile can be clearly identified in sample ht650-24
(2θ = 27.419, 36.06, and 54.3, JCPDF, PDF86-0148). Evidences
for WO3 crystallite are found in aged samples (2θ
= 23.081, 23.561, and 24.06, JCPDF, PDF 71-2141), though the signal
is below the detection limit in fresh samples. This phenomenon indicates
that the WO3 crystallites disperse very well in the fresh
sample and the dispersibility gets worse after 12 h’ deterioration.
That could affect the dispersion of V2O5 and
impact the number of active sites in return.33

The relationship between BET surface area and NOX conversion rates at 250 and 450 °C is displayed
in Figure 3a. There
is a significant
positive correlation between the BET specific surface area and NOX conversion rate. In samples ht650-4, ht650-8,
and ht650-24, the conversion rate decreases from 42.55 to 25.12% and
finally to 9.03% at 250 °C, and the BET surface area also decreases
from 43.52 to 19.85 m2/g and finally to 4.48 m2/g. The correlation coefficient of 450 °C is a little lower.
When the NOX conversion rate is higher,
the BET specific surface area is also higher. Therefore, BET surface
area reduction is proportional to the decrease of the NOX conversion rate. The reduction of the BET surface
area is the main reason for the decrease of the conversion rate during
aging.

Figure 3 (a) BET surface area vs NOX conversion
rate at 250 and 450 °C for fresh and hydrothermally aged samples.
(b) Average anatase particle dimension perpendicular to the (101)
plane vs BET surface area for different aged samples.

The relationship between the BET surface area and
average anatase
particle dimension perpendicular to the (101) plane is displayed in Figure 3b. The decrease of
the BET surface area is inversely proportional to the increase of
particle sizes. Larger crystallite sizes mean worse sintering and
agglomeration. Literature studies have pointed out that the reduction
in the BET surface area is due to anatase sintering and phase transition.20,35 That is to say, sintering and aggregation of anatase aggravate the
deactivation condition by reducing the BET surface area. Sintering
has been reported to have negative impacts on the dispersion of vanadium
species.35 Consequently, the effects of
sintering and aggregation during hydrothermal aging are inevitable
and should be highlighted.

The proportion of rutile TiO2 is obtained based on formula 3. Rutile
appeared in sample ht650-12 with a fraction
of 3.52%, the number dashes to 29.23% in sample ht650-24. Remarkably,
the content of rutile is 4.68% in sample ht635-24, much lower than
that in sample ht650-24. In addition, hydrothermal deterioration of
48 h at 600 °C results in no trace of rutile. As a result, phase
transition of TiO2 is greatly affected by hydrothermal
temperature, especially when the temperature is relatively high. Meanwhile,
the proportion of the rutile phase is enforced by aging time. However,
the catalyst has lost most of its activity before rutile accumulates
massively. After 16 h’ aging, the proportion of rutile increases
greatly, and the catalyst deactivates slowly. It is unreasonable to
attribute most of catalyst inability to anatase phase transition.
In fact, V2O5 has strong interactions with TiO2, which is related to the active sites.40 Meanwhile, anatase TiO2 is more active than
other supports.41 Thus, phase transition
must have interrupted those V–O–Ti connections and caused
some loss to the catalyst activity, but it is not as deadly as sintering.

2.3 Active-Site Variations
The mechanism
of vanadium-based catalysts has been frequently discussed in literatures.41−43 In situ FTIR was used to determine the changes in active sites after
NH3 adsorption at 100 and 200 °C. Studies have shown
that NH3 is adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites as ammonium
ions42 and coordinated over Lewis acid
sites.44 Typical results are shown in Figures 4, 5, S4 and S5. The bands at 1240
cm–1 are related to the symmetric bending vibrations
of N–H bonds on Lewis acid sites,44 whose asymmetric modes appear at 1609 cm–1.44,45 Correspondingly, the stretching modes are found at 3178 and 3245
cm–1 for coordinated ammonia on Lewis acid sites
and 3028 and 2808 cm–1 for the ion form of ammonium
adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites.45−47 All the samples show
bands at 1425 and 1676 cm–1 (small shifts will be
discussed later). They can be assigned to asymmetric and symmetric
bending vibrations of NH4+ species on Brønsted
acid sites, respectively.44,48 Some blue shifts occurred
in aged samples. In Figures S4 and S5,
the active sites at 1240 cm–1 shift to 1242 cm–1(T-8), 1245 cm–1 (T-12, T-16), 1247
cm–1 (T-20), and 1260 cm–1 (T-24).
It also happens in hydrothermal aging samples. The bands located at
1670 cm–1 also shift from 1670 cm–1 (fresh, T-4) to 1675 cm–1 (hydrothermal aging
samples). Studies14 have shown that blue
shift (to higher frequencies) would imply agglomeration of vanadium
because of sintering. Thus, hydrothermal aging makes acid sites move
to more stable location because of sintering and agglomeration.

Figure 4 In situ FTIR
spectra of the fresh sample and hydrothermally aged
samples ht650-4, ht650-8, ht650-12 at 100 °C. A lot of active
sites were lost during hydrothermal aging. The intensity changes a
lot. This graph is the superposition of the mentioned samples with
different ordinates. Some active sites would be unclear if the same
ordinate was used. It is the same with Figures 5, S4 and S5. The
intensity differences can be seen in Figure S6.

Figure 5 In situ FTIR spectra of NH3 adsorption
of thermally
aged samples T-4, T-8 and T-12, and the fresh sample at 100 °C
with different ordinates (the same with Figure 4). “L” refers to Lewis active
sites and “B” refers to Brønsted active sites.

The negative spectra 3654 cm–1 (V–OH)
are detected in sample fresh and T-4, however, they disappear in samples
T-16, T-20, and T-24, as shown in Figures S4 and S5. This indicates that good dispersion of VxOy species on TiO2 supporter48 has been affected. Taking the results of Section 2.2 into account,
impacts of sintering and BET surface area are key factors in the dispersion
and distribution of active sites. On the other hand, V–OH active
sites are very important in Topsøe’s catalytic cycle
of SCR.42 The disappearance directly affects
the catalyst NOX conversion ability. In
hydrothermally aged samples, V–OH active sites do not disappear
until the samples are aged for 24 h at 650 °C. Therefore, H2O can slow down this process in hydrothermal aging. In samples
T-20 and T-24, new bands appear at 3745 cm–1 (3730
cm–1 in sample ht650-24 instead), indicating some
free OH groups.42 These free OH groups
can come from surface tungsten31 or titanium.
They do not appear until the rutile phase emerges, indicating that
restructuring must occur on the surface of the catalyst because of
phase transformation.

Sample fresh and sample T-24 show broad
bands at around 3200 cm–1, while other thermally
aged samples show bands at
3178 and 3245 cm–1, and hydrothermally aged samples
show bands at 3170, 3200, and 3248 cm–1. There is
no perfect explanation for this phenomenon. As previously mentioned,
bands at 3245 cm–1 (3248 cm–1)31,45 are in the N–H stretching region and can be assigned to coordinated
ammonia on Lewis acid sites. Bands at 3178 cm–1 (3170
cm–1)31,45 are NH4+ ions adsorbed on the Brønsted acid sites of the surface.
One possible explanation is: at first, two peaks of Lewis acid sites
and Brønsted acid sites interact and mix with each other and
then broad bands appear at around 3200 cm–1,13 as detected in fresh samples. However, one kind
of acid sites is more sensitive to temperature. Thus, after aging,
the peaks of Lewis acid sites and Brønsted acid sites displayed
separately. After prolonged deactivation, a great loss of both Lewis
acid sites and Brønsted acid sites causes the two signals to
mix with each other again, for example, the weak signal detected in
sample T-24. The loss rate is different because of H2O
existence in the hydrothermal aging process, so it is not the
same as thermal aging samples.

In situ FTIR detection
is a semiquantitative experiment. Zhu et al.31 used the peak intensity to calculate the number of acid sites. On
the basis of that, the peak intensities of Lewis acid sites (1240
cm–1) and Brønsted acid sites (1425 cm–1) after hydrothermal and thermal deactivation were
calculated at 100 and 200 °C, as shown in Figures 6 and S6. For Lewis
acid sites, the reduction in fresh samples is 10.12%, while the minimum
decrease in aged samples is 20.65%. For Brønsted acid sites,
decrease in fresh samples is 42.38%, while the minimum reduction for
the aged samples is 68.73%. Therefore, the active sites in unaged
samples are less sensitive to characterization temperature.

Figure 6 Percentage
of active-site disappearance (%), percentage (%) = 100
× (peak intensity differences between 100 and 200 °C)/peak
intensity at 100 °C, calculated according to Zhu et al.31 For all the aged samples, the reduction of Lewis
active sites is in the left and Brønsted active sites in the
right. Overall, Brønsted active sites are more sensitive to the
characterization temperature.

Considering all the aged samples, the average reduction ratio
of
Lewis acid sites is less than the average reduction ratio of Brønsted
acid in Figure 6. For
samples with similar NOX conversion rates
(ht650-12 and ht635-24), samples aged at higher temperature are more
sensitive to the characterization temperature. Similarly, samples
with higher conversion rates are less sensitive to the characterization
temperature. Lin and Bai et al.32 argued
that Lewis acid sites were dominant in the absence of H2O molecules, and they were also less sensitive to temperature. In
contrast, Brønsted acid sites were dominant in the presence of
H2O molecules and were highly affected by temperature.
Lietti et al.49 proposed that Lewis-bonded
NH3 species were thermally more stable than ammonium ions.
This article proves their opinions. In summary, the Brønsted
acid sites are more susceptible and more unstable during hydrothermal
aging and thermal aging. The reduction in NOX conversion rate is strongly dependent on the stability of
the acid sites. The presence of H2O makes Brønsted
acid sites a little more stable.

2.4 Changes
of NH3 Storage Capacity
and Vanadium Ratio
Few studies have been reported using TPD
instruments to study the hydrothermal deactivation of catalyst so
far. Some yellow vanadium was found during hydrothermal and thermal
aging experiments at the outlet of the quartz tube, the same as description
in the literature.15 The volatilization
of vanadium is too difficult to quantify.7 Nonetheless, it indicates that a certain degree of acid sites has
been lost. The acid site amount and intensity of several aged samples
were detected by NH3-TPD and displayed in Figure 7, 8,
and S7. It cannot be ignored that the intensity
of the NH3 signal decreases tremendously, falling from
6 × 10–10 a.u. in the fresh sample to about
3 × 10–10 a.u. in sample ht650-4. Limited by
instruments, the consumption of NH3 is difficult to quantify
precisely, but the reduction of the integral area of the NH3 mass signal in TPD detection has the same trend as the abatement
of NOX conversion rates in Figures 8 and S7b, hinting a close tie between the number of active sites and the
NOX conversion ability of the SCR catalyst.
In short, one of the biggest reasons for catalyst deactivation is
the loss of active sites.

Figure 7 NH3-TPD spectra of fresh and hydrothermally
aged samples.
The peaks and NH3 storage capacity change a lot after aging.

Figure 8 Integral area of the NH3 mass signal
vs abatement of
NOX conversion rates of fresh and hydrothermally
aged samples. The NOX conversion ability
depends highly on NH3 storage capacity.

In Figure 8, the
decrease of NH3 integral area and the decrease of NOX conversion rates are not 100% linearly related.
The conversion rate of sample ht650-8 is lower than that of sample
ht600-48, but the integral area of sample ht650-8 is higher. Similarly,
the conversion rates of sample ht650-12 and sample ht635-24 are similar,
but sample ht650-12 has a larger integral area. In Figure S7b, there is no such difference when the aging temperature
is the same. The number of active sites reduces significantly in the
first 12 h. Thereafter, the reduction rate slows down, in accordance
with the deactivation of catalyst NOX conversion
ability. It shows better consistency at lower temperatures. In Figure S7a, the fresh sample exhibits a broad
peak around 290 °C, indicating the presence of medium-to-strong
acid sites.50 Later, the peak of sample
T-4 is around 248 °C and the peak of sample T-8 is 228 °C.
The peaks of sample T-12 and T-24 are approximately 212 °C. Thus,
NH3 desorption peaks shift to lower temperature. The above
results indicate that after aging, the strong adsorption sites of
NH3 disappeared a lot, and the proportion of weak adsorption
sites among the remaining active sites becomes larger. The active
sites which adsorbed NH3 weakly, mainly affect the catalyst
performance at lower temperature.

Although ammonia desorption
amount of the catalyst is positively
correlated with the NOX conversion rates,
samples are not completely identical at different aging temperatures.
When the deactivation temperature is high enough, NH3 desorption
amount is higher than that aged at lower temperature and longer aging
time, though it may have a lower NOX conversion
rate. Interestingly, peaks of sample ht600-48, ht625-24, and ht635-24
shift more to the left than the samples of the same NOX conversion rates. It reflects the fact that although
high temperature plays a major role in the aging process, the aging
time changes the proportion of active sites. Compared hydrothermally
and thermally aged samples of the same deactivation time, peaks of
the two are not so different. Thus, the influence of H2O on active sites during hydrothermal aging is not particularly large.

XPS measurements were performed to investigate the surface binding
energies and valence states of various aged species. The results are
shown in Table 1. The
binding energies of V 2p3/2 at 515.5–516.2 and 516.5–517.3
eV in the table correspond to V4+ and V5+ species,
respectively.9,51−53 Notably, most
of aged samples have larger binding energies (except for sample T-4
and sample ht635-24). This could be related to the morphological changes
of vanadium during aging. Vanadium is not so well dispersed on the
surface of TiO2 after deactivation. In addition, the values
of V4+/(V4+ + V5+) increase in hydrothermally
aged samples. Larger V4+/(V4+ + V5+) ratio would generate more free electrons. It also illustrated that
V4+ species have more stable structures.54 For thermally aged samples, no significant laws
of change in the ratio of V4+/(V4+ + V5+). This could result from the peaks of vanadium affected by peaks
of O 1s satellites. Both Brønsted and Lewis active sites have
V4+ and V5+, trends of V4+/(V4+ + V5+) are different for hydrothermally and thermally
aged samples. It also verifies the different loss ratio of Brønsted
acid and Lewis acid sites during deactivation.

3 Discussion
As described in Section 2.1, the relative deactivation degree at lower
temperatures is
higher. As mentioned in Section 2.3, Brønsted acid sites are more sensitive to temperature
and are greatly lost during thermal aging. The TPD results have proved
the significant loss of strong adsorption sites. The large loss of
related acid sites makes the conversion rate at lower temperatures
(mainly around 250 °C) decrease more than the higher temperatures
(mainly around 400 °C). Therefore, the Brønsted acid is
a strong adsorption site for the adsorption of NH3 and
contributes a lot to the NOX conversion
ability at lower temperature.

Topsøe55 proposed the reaction
mechanism of the vanadium-based SCR catalyst based on Brønsted
acid sites, and Ramis56 elaborated the
mechanism model based on Lewis acid sites. Combined with the results
of hydrothermal and thermal aging in this research, both Brønsted
acid sites and Lewis acid sites are involved in the reaction. A most
likely mechanism is shown in Figure 9. Ammonia can be adsorbed on Brønsted acid and
Lewis acid sites. The ammonia adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites
reacts with NO with the help of V=O and produces N2 and H2O, as well as V4+–OH and V5+–OH. Ammonia adsorbed on the Lewis acid site reacts
with NO and generates V4+–OH, N2 and
H2O. Finally, V4+–OH can be reduced to
V=O with the aid of O2. The working temperature
range of these two acid sites is not exactly the same. Different active
sites participate in SCR reactions with different activation energies,
resulting in biased reactions. The main working temperature of each
active site is also different. The loss of active sites in aging is
the biggest reason for deactivation, but changes in the proportion
of active sites also result in changes of reaction products and conversion
rates.

Figure 9 Deactivation mechanism of NH3-SCR reaction on vanadium-based
catalysts. Both Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites are
involved in the SCR reaction. Aging decreases the number of active
sites and changes the ratio of different active sites, affecting the
catalytic cycle.

On the basis of the above
catalytic mechanism, the hydrothermal
deactivation mechanism in this research can be summarized as follows:
in the process of hydrothermal aging, sintering of the carrier leads
to the reduction of the BET surface area. The BET surface area has
a great relationship with NOX conversion
rates than the NH3 adsorption capacity, comparing the results
in Figures 3a and 8. Thus, decrease of active sites and changes in
the ratio of active sites probably originates from BET surface area
reduction. More exactly, the decrease in sintering and BET surface
area results in the reduction of NH3 adsorption amount
and loss of active sites. In the process of aging, different kinds
of active sites have different antiaging abilities. Different ratios
of remaining active sites cause the conversion rate of the catalyst
to be different in the high temperature range and the low temperature
range, which is proved by FTIR and XPS results.

Comparing the
thermal and hydrothermal aging samples deactivated
at 650 °C of the same time, such as the NOx conversion rate in Figure 1b, the active site
changes in Figures 4 and 5, it can be found that H2O only slightly accelerates the sintering and the BET surface area
reduction and increases the stability of Brønsted acid sites
a little. The value of V4+/(V4+ + V5+) rises in Table 1 also prove that. In short, high temperature is the main reason that
affects the conversion rates. The impacts of H2O are not
so great. In addition, although the catalyst remains highly active
after 48 h hydrothermal aging at 600 °C, its peak in TPD experiments
shift obviously and the value of V4+/(V4+ +
V5+) differs from the fresh sample. Hence, the time of
deactivation can change the ratio of active sites.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, a commercial Vanadia-SCR catalyst
was hydrothermally
and thermally deactivated at 600,625, 635, and 650 °C for 4 h
to as long as 48 h. Samples were characterized by performing XRD,
BET, XPS, in situ FTIR, and NH3-TPD experiments. Main findings
are as follows:

Both Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites
are involved in the
SCR reaction. The two acid sites have different main operation temperatures
and antiaging abilities. Brønsted acid sites are more likely
to disappear in hydrothermal and thermal aging. They contribute more
at lower temperatures. Thus, the conversion rates of the lower temperature
decrease more after aging. The more stable Lewis acid sites may work
in the entire evaluation temperature range. It needs further study.
Thermal deactivation causes sintering, which leads to the decrease
of the BET surface area. This in turn causes the reduction of the
NH3 adsorption amount and the changes of active sites.
The different ratios and great loss of active sites after aging should
be responsible for hydrothermal deactivation.

In hydrothermal
aging, high temperature is the key factor of catalyst
deactivation. In the early stage of aging, the high temperature causes
the catalyst carrier to sinter and the particles to grow. Sintering
has negative impacts on the dispersion of vanadium species and reduction
of the surface area, indirectly affecting the number and distribution
of active sites. Another result of high temperature is anatase phase
transition. Although this has been repeatedly mentioned in the previous
studies, it turns out to be less important than sintering because
it does not show up until the catalyst has lost most of its activity.
However, it probably influences the surface reconstruction. Speaking
of aging time, it can greatly accelerate the degree of deactivation.
However, doubling the aging time at lower temperature does not lead
to phase change, for example, sample ht600-48. Therefore, the effect
of aging time is not as great as the temperature. Nonetheless, differences
in aging time can change the proportion of the active sites. It speeds
up the reduction of strong adsorption sites for NH3. Refers
to the role of H2O, the conversion rates of samples hydrothermally
and thermally deactivated under the same conditions do not have big
differences. However, H2O inhibits the loss of Brønsted
acid sites a little and accelerates sintering and loss of surface
area a little.

5 Experimental Section
The catalyst provided by the China National Heavy Duty Truck Group
Co. Ltd. is a commercial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst, which has been widely used in China. The
catalyst consists of 2.45% V2O5, 9.6% WO3, and 86.6% TiO2. V2O5 is
the active component. As the stabilizer, WO3 increases
the number of NH3 adsorption sites57 and prevents anatase from transforming into rutile.20 TiO2 acts as the carrier. The catalyst was prepared
by an incipient wetness impregnation method. At first, oxalic acid
and NH4VO3 were dissolved in pure water and
stirred for 30 min. This solution was then mixed with anatase TiO2 and WO3 powder and stirred for 1.5 h. After that,
the mixture was dried and carefully ground. The final step was to
calcine the catalyst at 550 °C for 3 h. The catalyst was pressed
and sieved prior to the aging experiments.

Hydrothermal and
thermal deactivation experiments were performed
on the flow reactor shown in Figure S1.
The feed gas mixture contained 350 ppm NO, 350 ppm NH3,
10% O2, and the remaining N2. The space velocity
was 40 000 h–1. Quartz sand was used to reduce
the gas flow resistance and would be sieved out after the aging experiments.
Each sample contained a mixture of 1.2 g of V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst and 0.8 g of quartz sand.
Samples were hydrothermally aged at 600 °C for 48 h, 625 °C
for 24 h, 635 °C for 24 h, 650 °C for 4, 8, 12 h, and for
24 h and thermally aged at 650 °C every 4 h from 4 to 24 h. The
unaged catalyst sample is labeled “Fresh”. Hydrothermally
aged samples are labeled “htT-t”, where “T” represents the
aging temperature and “t” refers to
the aging time (hours). For example, sample ht600-48 represents samples
aged at 600 °C for 48 h. Thermally aged samples at 650 °C
for different hours are labelled “T-4”, “T-8”,
“T-12”, “T-16”, “T-20”,
and “T-24” respectively.

The SCR catalytic performance
tests were carried out in the same
flow reactor with a mixture of 80 mg catalyst samples and 160 mg quartz
sand. The feed gas consisted of 450 ppm NO, 450 ppm NH3, 10% O2, 7.8% H2O, and the balance N2. The concentrations of NOX were recorded
every 50 °C between 200 and 450 °C at atmospheric pressure.
Data were continuously recorded for over 10 min in the steady-state
condition and the average values were used to calculate the NOX conversion rate. The corresponding space
velocity was 3 × 105 h–1. NOX conversion rates (%) were obtained using
Formula 1, where C refers to the concentration. 1  

Phase transition and sintering were characterized by XRD measurements
on a PANalytical X’Pert3 diffractometer. Samples were scanned
from 10° to 80° (2θ) in steps of 0.02° s–1 with the Cu Ka anode (λ = 0.15405 Å) at
40 kV and 40 mA. The crystallite dimension D was
calculated using Scherrer equation 2  where k is a constant
depending
on the shape of the particle, λ is the wavelength of X-ray radiation,
β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction
peak, and θ is the position. The average dimension Danatase(101) refers to the anatase particles perpendicularly
to the (1 0 1) plane.

The proportion of rutile in aged samples
was estimated by following
equation 3  where Ia and Ir are the intensity of (101) and (110) plane
reflections for anatase and rutile, respectively.

In situ FTIR
experiments were performed on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR
spectrometer at 100 and 200 °C to detect the active-site changes.
The skeletal spectra were recorded in the region of 800–4000
cm–1 at 4 cm–1 resolution. All
samples were ground to 100 meshes and were pretreated in a stream
of N2 at the temperature of 350 °C for 1 h. Then they
were cooled to 100 and 200 °C and saturated with 1000 ppm NH3 for 1 h. Thereafter, the physical adsorption was removed
using a 100 mL/min N2 flow before recording the FTIR spectra
for 50 min. Time-resolved data were obtained according to the available
literature.31

XPS is a surface-sensitive
analytical technique providing compositional
data and elemental oxidation states. XPS measurements were performed
on VG ESCALAB MARK II, using Mg Ka (1253.6 eV) X-ray beam. The C 1s
line at 284.6 eV from carbon was used as a reference. The binding
energies were calculated with software XPS Peak 4.1. N2 adsorption isotherms for the BET surface area were measured at 77
K with a Micromeritics Trista II. Samples were pretreated for 12 h
at 150 °C under vacuum.

NH3-TPD experiments
were conducted on a fixed-bed reaction
system using a chemisorption instrument AutoChem II 2920. Desorption
of NH3 was recorded by an online QIC20 mass spectrometer.
Prior to the test, 46 mg samples were pretreated in a He stream (50
mL/min) at 450 °C for 45 min. The samples were then cooled to
60 °C and purged for 30 min in 10% NH3/He flow (50
mL/min). After sweeping samples with He gas (50 mL/min) for 90 min,
the reactor temperature was raised to 500 °C at a constant heating
rate of 10 °C/min. Although H2O has been proved to
convert NH3 species to NH4+ species,25,31 it is not allowed to add H2O into the experiments of
FTIR and NH3-TPD for the device protection.
