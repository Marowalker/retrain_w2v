Proportional
to considerable progress in protein–drug conjugations,
attention to the efficient peptide coupling reagents is being increased.
Hence, in this study, a versatile heterogeneous nanoscale reagent
is presented for chemical, biological, and medical purposes. A combination
of silver and silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Ag/Fe3O4) has been well functionalized with isothiazolone rings
via a silver-modified Heck mechanism. An appropriate condition is
provided for peptide bond formation through the surface interplay
between silanol groups and the loaded isothiazolone rings. A logical
mechanism including a series of successive covalent bonds onto the
surface of Ag/Fe3O4 nanocomposites is suggested
for this catalyzed peptide bond formation. Accurate comparisons have
been made to obtain the optimum value of the nanocatalyst and suitable
conditions. As an additional application, the biological activity
of the desired product has also been investigated through antibacterial
assay tests. The results showed that our desired product could also
be used as an effective heterogeneous nanoscale antibacterial agent
for different purposes. In this regard, all of the essential structural
and practical analyses have been carried out and precisely interpreted.

1 Introduction
Peptides
have always been one of the most important materials in
chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmaceutical research. In recent years,
attention to conjugated drugs as a new generation of the high-tech
pharmacy with high efficiency has been increased.1−4 In the field of peptide–drug
conjugation, we have to deal with amide bond formation between chemical
compounds and biological structures that are mostly made of protein
strands and amino acid units.5,6 As one of the most important
medicinal scopes, we could refer to antibody–drug conjugates
as a new generation of anticancer drugs with high efficiencies.7,8 Therefore, preparation of efficient amide/peptide coupling reagents
that could assist the amide/peptide bond formation has always been
considered as a significant research field. For instance, the efficiency
of the surface catalytic sites has been demonstrated using TiO2 anatase for peptide bond formation by Pantaleone et al.9 Additionally, (1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethylidenaminooxy)dimethylaminomorpholinocarbenium
hexafluorophosphate salt has been introduced as an effective coupling
reagent for peptide bond formation in the aqueous phase under mild
condition by Gabriel et al.10 In this regard,
a substantial procedure has also been reported for peptide bond formation
without the need of coupling reagents or protecting groups, using N-carboxyanhydrides and polyethylene glycol resins in water,
by Gentilucci et al.11

On the other
hand, nanomaterials with notable features have attracted
so much attention as instrumental species for various purposes like
catalysts and coupling reagents in chemical reactions. First, they have a large surface area for catalyzing a chemical reaction
through their nanoscale. Therefore, a partial amount of nanocatalyst
would be enough for a carrying out a reaction. Second, they are easily
separable from the reaction mixture through their heterogeneity and
magnetic traits.12,13 Additionally, their surfaces
could be modified with various organic compounds or amorphous structures
like silica network, as a secondary shell.14,15 Moreover, the use of water absorbents or reductive agents like active
phosphorus-containing molecular sieves in amide/peptide dehydration
condensations is necessary.16,17 Silica networks have
been reported as great molecular sieves due to the presence of an
amorphous and mesoporous structure and also effective interactions
between silicon and oxygen atoms.18,19 In addition,
the presence of an extreme number of silanol groups makes them an
appropriate substrate for peptide bond formation.20 Hence, in this study, we have used silica-network-coated
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as dehydrating agents and also as a
helpful assistant in peptide bond formation. An isothiazolone (IT)
ring was also used as another assistant for peptide bond formation.32 The IT ring was loaded onto the surface of MNPs
through covalent bonding via a modified Heck reaction approach. The
final product was used in the peptide bond formation as a heterogeneous,
recyclable, and nanoscale coupling reagent instead of homogeneous
and expensive reagents. Since we deal with biosynthetic protein structures
in many peptide conjugates, it is essential to prepare and use the
tools with biological properties such as antimicrobial and antibacterial
activities.21 Therefore, silver NPs were
used for both modification of the Heck mechanism and endowment of
antibacterial activity to the designed nanoscale product.22,23 However, this efficient product in the large-scale fabrications
prevents the use of expensive and hazardous materials. In addition,
in the industrial production and scale up, the recycled nanoscale
reagent could be isolated with more convenience through the magnetic
property. Overall, in this work, we report a nanoscale amide/peptide
coupling reagent that could be a substantial alternative for conventional
peptide coupling reagents such as O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU).24 Our novel
reagent is constructed of IT-functionalized silica-coated silver/iron
oxide (Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT) core/shell
nanostructures and takes advantage of an independent strategy to assist
amide/peptide binding that does not require any additional reagent
such as phosphorous-containing molecular sieves or redox agents (Figure 1).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT Nanocomposites
In
the first stage, Fe3O4 MNPs were obtained through
co-deposition of
iron(II) and iron(III) chloride salts in basic condition (pH ∼
12), according to the method introduced in the literature.26 The generated dark precipitations were collected
by magnetic separation, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and
dried at 50 °C. To increase hydroxyl groups onto the surface
of MNPs, they were coated with a SiO2 network using tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS). Next, the surfaces of MNPs were modified with
vinyl groups using trimethoxy(vinyl)silane.27 In the last step, produced Fe3O4@SiO2@C=C MNPs were functionalized with isothiazolone rings by
performing a Heck reaction on the surface of MNPs using palladium(II)
chloride and other moieties of Heck reaction. According to the mechanism
of Heck reaction, alkyl iodides and alkyl bromides are preferred for
this approach due to having more suitable leaving groups.28 In this work, it has been shown that alkyl chlorides
could also be used in the Heck reactions using partial amounts of
silver nitrate as a modifier. Through using AgNO3, we could
either modify the Heck reaction between 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one
(CMI) and surface vinyl groups to raise the yield of the reaction
and also produce Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT
nanocomposites as the desired nanoscale product (Scheme 1).

2.2 Optimization of the Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT Nanocomposite Synthesis
The optimization
reactions were carried out in different solvents, at different temperatures,
and with different amounts of silver nitrate by performing various
methods. The results were monitored using Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR) and especially energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
analysis. The obtained results have been reported in Table 1. As a criterion of the loading
ratio for each product, we considered the weight percentage of a sulfur
atom in the EDX spectra. The maximum ratio of CMI loading was obtained
under reflux condition in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 110 °C using
0.1 g of AgNO3. It has been distinguished by the superscript
letter “a” in the table. The results of EDX analysis
have been reported in the Supporting Information.

2.3 Characterization of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT Nanocomposites
The identification
and characterization of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites were performed using various equipment and methods.
FT-IR spectroscopy was used to investigate surface functional groups
that were loaded onto the MNPs during each step. The presence of new
elements after coating reactions was confirmed by EDX analysis. Scanning
electron microscope (SEM) imaging for the size and morphology of MNPs
and transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging for investigation
of core–shell and composite structures were used. A vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM) was used to measure the magnetic properties
of the desired nanoscale product. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used for structural studies. CHNS
analysis was used to obtain more confirmation about the existence
of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms in the structure of the final
product.

2.3.1 Structural Studies
The infrared
spectrum of (c) Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT
was compared with the spectra of (b) vinyl-modified Fe3O4@SiO2 and (a) Fe3O4@SiO2 MNPs. As it can be seen in Figure 2, the absorption peaks at 582, 800, 941,
and 1089–1100 cm–1, observed in all samples,
can be assigned to Fe–O, Si–O, Si–OH, and Si–O–Si
stretching vibrations, respectively. For Fe3O4@SiO2@vinyl, the peak at 1654 cm–1 ascribed
to C=C stretching and the signal related to sp2 C–H
bonds were covered by the broad peak of surface −OH groups
at 3000–3100 cm–1. In the spectrum (c), new
absorption peaks appeared at 1635, 2925, and 3326 cm–1, which are related to C=O amide, sp3 C–H
stretching, and hydroxyl groups, respectively. According to the structure
of the desired product (Scheme 1d), the carbonyl group has an intense resonance with nitrogen
and π-bond in a conjugated system. That is why the absorption
peak of C=O appeared at 1635 cm–1. Figure 3 shows the results
of EDX analysis on (a) Fe3O4@SiO2 and (b) Fe3O4@SiO2@vinyl MNPs.
The spectra revealed the existence of Fe, Si, O, and C elements after
performing the coating reactions on the surface of iron oxide MNPs.
The figure also compares the results after executing Ag-modified Heck
reaction on the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2@vinyl MNPs, with a typical Heck reaction (Figure 3c,d). According to the figure, we observe
more loading ratio when AgNO3 is used. We considered the
intensity of the sulfur signal as a criterion of loading ratio. To
obtain more confirmation about the final product, CHNS analysis was
also carried out, and related results are reported in the Supporting Information of this article.

Microscopic imaging methods have
always been as an instrumental
tool for monitoring morphologies, real structures, sizes, and other
properties of the micro- and nanoparticles. Therefore, we used these
techniques to determine the physical properties of our nanoscale products.
As we can see in Figure 4a,b, the morphology of IT-coated MNPs exhibits highly dispersed particles
with spherical morphology. The SEM images of (a) Fe3O4@SiO2 and (b) Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites also revealed the particle size. Statistical
data of particle sizes (for 22 particles) revealed no remarkable differences
between the particles. According to Figure 4c, the mean size was also reported as 31
nm for Fe3O4@SiO2 MNPs and then it
increased to 66 nm for the final product. This means that a new layer
has been loaded onto the surface by Heck reaction. The core–shell
structure of Fe3O4@SiO2@IT MNPs,
which have been placed on the surface of Ag nanoparticles, was proven
by TEM imaging (Figure 5a–d). As it can be seen in the figure (c), the dark areas
in the structure of Fe3O4@SiO2@IT
MNPs belong to the Fe3O4 MNPs present as a core
and bright areas belong to SiO2@IT that have coated the
core. In the figure (b, d), Ag and Fe3O4 MNPs
appear in black and gray, respectively, because silver has a higher
electron density in comparison with iron oxide NPs, so fewer electrons
can transmit through the Ag nanoparticles.

Figure 6 shows
the
XRD patterns of (a) Fe3O4 MNPs, (b) Ag nanoparticles,
and (c) Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites.
The XRD pattern of Fe3O4 MNPs and Ag NPs have
been reported according to the database of JCPDS (PDF#99-0073) and
(PDF#87-0597), respectively. As the figure shows, the peaks that appeared
at 30.72, 36.22, 43.83, 57.73, and 63.43° correspond to the diffraction
pattern of Fe3O4 MNPs. They are marked by their
Miller indices of (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0),
respectively. In addition, the peaks that appeared at 38.07, 44.26,
64.35, and 77.28° correspond to the diffraction pattern of Ag
nanoparticles. They are marked by their Miller indices of (1 1 1),
(2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1), respectively. As compared with the
two reference patterns (a, b), eight new peaks at 9.13, 29.33, 31.78,
32.48, 34.00, 34.59, 36.92, and 37.51°, which have been marked
with the stars, were observed in the spectrum of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites. These new peaks
are attributed to the new layer created by the IT coating. The average
size of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites
was also calculated as 66 nm by Highscore Plus software and Scherrer
formula (see the Supporting Information). It can be deduced that this increase
in the particle size is due to coating of the core with the organic
layer.

2.3.2 Thermal
Resistance Behavior
The
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposite is shown in Figure 7. As we can see in the figure, at the beginning
of the study, a partial increase in the weight (1%) was observed at
the first stage (a). This increase in weight was due to the absorbance
of the moisture. According to the curve, with the increasing temperature,
the weight loss trend was descending till around 580 °C (b).
At this stage, almost 7% of the weight was lost due to the removal
of absorbed physical and chemical water. It can be deduced that water
molecules were trapped in the silica network and they were removed
by the increasing temperature. Then, the second shoulder in the curve
appeared at 625 °C (c) and most likely belonged to the decomposition
of the loaded IT ring. Next, the vinyl layer was probably separated
and the main structure of the silica network and Fe3O4 MNPs was collapsed at higher temperatures. Through this remarkable
thermal resistance, Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites could also be used for local heating in the field
of photodynamic therapy (PDT).

through the losing water, and (c) second shoulder showing the main
decomposition of nanocomposites.

2.3.3 Magnetic Property Investigation
Among various species of chemical structures that play a catalytic
role in the chemical and biochemical reactions through relatively
the same mechanism, the Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposite has several noticeable advantages. First, it is
a magnetic nanoscale catalyst, which is separable from the reaction
mixture with more convenience in comparison with other organocatalysts
such as benzoisothiazolone or diselenide derivatives.25,29 Using an external magnet would be adequate to separate the catalyst
from the reaction mixture due to the existence of iron element in
the core of NPs. The magnetic trait of our nanoscale product was investigated
using VSM analysis (Figure 8a). The Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT
nanocomposite exhibits a typical superparamagnetic behavior, as presented
in the figure. Obviously, the magnetic feature would be reduced proportional
to coating of the core with more layers. The images of the collection
of catalyst particles using an external magnet have been shown in Figure 8b.

2.4 Catalytic
Application in Peptide Construction
In recent decade, significant
progress in the fabrication of bio-conjugated
protein medications such as liraglutide (Victoza) and antibody-drug
antibody−drug conjugates has led researchers to design and
introduce novel amide/peptide coupling reagents that are more instrumental
for protein−drug conjugation purposes. However, to form an
amide bond via traditional methods, first, the carboxylic acid group
is activated by wasteful, expensive, or hazardous activators.30 Then, the workup process is needed to extract
the desired product from the reaction mixture. Concisely, a multistep
process is required to make amide/peptide bonds in the solution phase.
In this study, we present a convenient strategy for peptide bond formation
using Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT as a recyclable
and easily separable nanoscale coupling reagent. In this regard, Fmoc-Phe-OH,
Fmoc-Ala-OH, and glycine methyl ester were used to form the peptide
bonds. To investigate the efficiency of the fabricated nanocomposite,
first, a simple amidation reaction between benzoic acid and ethylamine
was carried out. The progress rate of catalyzed reactions was monitored
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction times were reduced
and in contrast the yields of peptide-binding reactions were increased
when we used Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT as
the coupling reagent. As a limitation of this catalyst, it should
be noted that the presented strategy could not be implemented for
all of the amino acids. For instance, cysteine-containing couplings
are not executed via this method due to the existence of a thiol site
in their structure and S–S bond formation. However, the resulted
dipeptide products have been identified by FT-IR and 1H
NMR spectroscopies (see the Supporting Information). In the related FT-IR spectra of both (A) Fmoc-Ala-Gly-OMe and
(B) Fmoc-Phe-Gly-OMe, the peak at 1541.02 cm–1 is
ascribed to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group of the
Fmoc protector group. The peaks appearing at 1650–1700 cm–1 belong to the peptide bond carbonyl group, and 1730
and 1749 cm–1 peaks are related to C=O of
glycine methyl ester. In the 1H NMR spectra, as they were
predicted by Chemdraw software, in the spectrum of A, a doublet signal
at 1.26 ppm and a quartet of doublet signal at 3.85 ppm appeared,
which are related to the methyl group and α proton of alanine,
respectively. In the spectrum B, diastereotopic
protons of the benzyl group belonging to phenylalanine appeared at
2.81 and 3.06 ppm as doublet and triplet signals, respectively. In
both spectra, a singlet signal appearing at 3.65 ppm was attributed
to the methoxy group of glycine methyl ester and broad base signals
at 8.31 and 8.54 ppm were related to −NHCO of peptide bonds.

2.4.1 Optimization of Catalytic Values in Peptide
Coupling Reactions
The control experiments were carried out
using TBTU/HOBT as a conventional amide/peptide coupling reagent,24 P(OEt)3 as an additional molecular
sieve,25 and Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites (Figure 9). The progression of the reactions was controlled
by TLC and ninhydrin spray after every 30 min of reactions. The conditions
and the results of control tests are reported in the Supporting Information in more detail. The separation of the
catalyst from the reaction mixture was carried out using an external
magnet without the need of more purifications. To confirm carbocation
formation in step 2, the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine test was performed.
The images of the reaction mixture before and after addition of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
solution instead of glycine methyl ester revealed that the carboxylic
acid group of N-protected amino acid has been activated according
to the mechanism (see the Supporting Information). These control experiments revealed that the catalyzed peptide
binding does not require any additional auxiliaries and works as an
independent driving force for amide/peptide bond formation. In the
structure of desired final product, the silica network around the
magnetic core works as a good molecular sieve and plays an important
role in the dehydrative amide condensations. The presented core/shell
nanoscale system provides a suitable substrate for amide/peptide bond
formation through the surface hydroxyl groups in the vicinity of isothiazolone
rings (see the suggested mechanism).

Figure 9 Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT screening and
the comparative values of Fmoc-Ala-Gly-OMe coupling reaction times
(h) and yields (%) in the presence of TBTU and various amounts of
Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites:
(a) TBTU/0.64 g, (b) Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT 0.2 g/P(EtO)3, (c) Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT 0.2 g, (d) Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT 0.2 g, (e) Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT
0.15 g, and (f) Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT
0.1 g.

The catalytic amounts of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT also affected reaction times
and yields. Figure 9 also shows the comparative
values of reduced reaction times and reaction yields when various
amounts of the catalyst were used for peptide coupling of equivalent
quantities (2 mmol) of Fmoc-Ala-OH and glycine methyl ester. As can
be seen in the graph, the optimum condition for peptide coupling reaction
was obtained when 0.2 g of the catalyst was used in 4 h.

2.4.2 Catalyst Recyclability
To investigate
the reusability of the desired product, it was magnetically isolated
after each peptide coupling reaction, washed, dried, and used again
in further reaction. For this purpose, first, the catalyst MNPs were
collected using an external magnet and then washed with deionized
water three times. Next, they were well dispersed in deionized water
via ultrasonication. Next, MNPs were washed with ethanol and acetone
three additional times and collected again. Ultimately, they were
well dried at 60 °C. It should be noted that, after several uses
(five times), the light-brown color of the catalyst was converted
to dark brown. Most likely, it originates from a damage to the silica
network that coated iron oxide MNPs during washing and ultrasonication.
This is proven by successive reductions in the peptide coupling reaction
yields between Fmoc-Phe-OH and glycine methyl ester (Figure 10). After five-time recycling
and reusing, partial yields (under 30%) were obtained, which confirm
the color change and the structural damage that were mentioned earlier.
The structure of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT
was preserved after using it in the peptide forming reactions, and
it is confirmed by EDX analysis after recycling (see the SI file).

Figure 10 Recyclability investigation of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT in catalyzed peptide coupling
reactions. The results were
obtained from the coupling reaction between Fmoc-Phe-OH and methyl
glycinate, per 0.2 g of the catalyst at room temperature.

2.4.3 Suggested Mechanism
The mechanism
of assisted amide/peptide bond formation on the surface of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites has been shown
in Figure 11. As it
can be observed, a four-step process occurred after addition of N-protected
amino acids and then Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT was recycled during the reaction. Before initiating the mechanistic
study, it should be mentioned that some of the hydroxyl groups, which
are present in the vicinity of isothiazolone rings on the surface,
will participate in the surface functionalization reaction with trimethoxy(vinyl)silane
and the rest will remain intact. Therefore, in the first stage, a nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl
group in the vicinity of the vinyl group present on the SiO2 network around the core occurs on the carboxyl group, which leads
to dehydration condensation. Additionally, it should be noted that
the protected amino acids should be in their canonical state (nonprotonated
state) via controlling the pH (isoelectric point). In stage 2, by
transferring the electron charge from oxygen to sulfur atoms, the
S–N bond is broken and the IT ring is opened. It is so crucial
to use a dry solvent and a neutral atmosphere as reaction conditions
due to the formation of carbocations. Next, in stage 3, the amine
group of glycine methyl ester attacks carbocations, created by the
transfer of electrons of the carbonyl. Ultimately, in the fourth stage,
by an electron-transferring process, which is started from the nitrogen
atom and ends at the oxygen atom, the IT ring is closed and the catalyst
is recycled again and an amide/peptide bond is formed.

process of assisted-peptide bond formation by Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT.

2.5 Biological Applications
The fast
progress in catalytic chemistry has been stimulating research in bioinorganic
and bioorganometallic chemistry, with the discovery of the biological
relevance of organometallic catalysts. Since for protein conjugations
we deal with biosynthetic structures, it is essential to prepare and
use the tools with biological properties such as antimicrobial and
antibacterial activities. In addition to the catalytic activity, our
nanoscale product could be used for biological purposes as an additional
application. The IT ring is individually used in cosmetic substances
as an antimicrobial agent.31 This property
was enhanced through combination with silver nanoparticles. Accordingly,
we evaluated the antibacterial activity of our desired product by
carrying out the in vitro biological tests. The antibacterial properties
of the samples toward Gram-positive Staphylococcus
aureus (ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 9637) bacteria were evaluated
according to the disc diffusion antibiotic sensitivity test. The samples
were subjected to the nutrient agar plates consisting of bacterial
cells, and then the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
The zone of inhibition (ZOI), which shows the inhibition of microbial
growth around the discs, was measured to determine the relative antibacterial
effects of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites
on E.coli and S. aureus (Figure 12a,b).
The antibiotic gentamicin was employed as a positive control. Disk
diffusion test results also indicated that the Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2 MNPs show a smaller inhibition zone for E. coli (1.86 ± 0.27 mm) and S. aureus (2.25 ± 0.31 mm), as reported in Table 2. This reduced effect
is due to the lack of the IT ring. The colony-forming unit (CFU) test
has been carried out to monitor the antibacterial activity of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT using E. coli and S. aureus strains. As can be
seen in Figure 12c–f,
a great number of colonies of E. coli and S. aureus (c, d) were reduced
by our nanoscale composite product after 24 h. The obtained results
from the plate count technique have been reported in Table 2.

3 Conclusions
Nowadays, protein–drug conjugates as the next generation
of the pharmaceutical compounds have led researchers to design novel
and more efficient coupling reagents that are easily isolated from
the reaction mixture and also conveniently recycled. In this work,
a novel nanoscale peptide coupling reagent has been synthesized and
its application has been investigated in peptide bond formation. Silver–iron
oxide nanocomposites have been prepared by the execution of Heck reaction
between vinyl-modified core–shell silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles
and isothiazolone rings. In this regard, we have made an effort to
design a heterogeneous, magnetic, and recyclable nanocomposite functionalized
with isothiazolone and implement a green and self-running mechanism
in the amide/peptide bond formation. The EDX analysis has confirmed
the main structure of our produced nanoscale product and also the
maintenance of the structure after several uses in peptide coupling
reactions. The coupling reaction time is reduced to about 4 h using
this nanoscale product. As another substantial feature, a self-running
process occurred that did not require any extra reagent as a starting
reductant or terminal oxidant. In other words, the peptide-binding
catalysis process is completely green using the presented product.
The morphology and particle sizes have also been monitored by SEM
and TEM analyses (Figures 4 and 5), and the mean sizes of particles
were determined as 31 and 66 nm for Fe3O4@SiO2@vinyl magnetic nanoparticles and Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites, respectively. Finally, a partial
amount of the produced catalyst was used to carry out the peptide
coupling reaction. As an additional application, the biological activity
of the desired product was investigated through antimicrobial assay
tests. The results showed that the Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposite could also be used as an effective heterogeneous
nanoscale antibacterial agent for different purposes. The functionalization
of iron oxide nanoparticles with isothiazolone rings was confirmed
by FT-IR, EDX, XRD, and CHNS. The thermal resistance of the desired
product was studied using TGA analysis. It was deduced that Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT nanocomposites could be used for local heating in the field of
photodynamic therapy (PDT) because of having a substantial thermal
resistance.

4 . Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Equipment
All solvents,
chemicals, and reagents were purchased from Merck, Fluka, and Sigma-Aldrich,
except CMI, which was purchased from Santacruz (CAS Number: 26172-55-4).
Melting points were measured on an Electrothermal 9100 apparatus and
were uncorrected. SEM images were taken with a Zeiss-DSM 960A microscope
with an attached camera. EDX spectra were recorded on Numerix DXP–X10P.
FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR-470 spectrometer. Transmission
electron microscopy was carried out on a Philips CM200. XRD measurements
were carried out using an X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer operating
at 40 mA and 40 kV. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with Varian
Unity Inova 500 MHz. Thermal analysis (TGA) was carried out by Bahr-STA
504 instrument under an argon atmosphere. The magnetic properties
of samples were analyzed at room temperature using a VSM (Meghnatis
Kavir Kashan Co., Kashan, Iran). An incubator (Sh, Noor Sanat Ferdos)
was used for biological tests. Elemental analysis (CHNS) was carried
out using an elemental combustion system, Costech 4010. The statistical
data of particle sizes from SEM imaging and XRD analysis were obtained
by Digimizer and Highscore plus, respectively.

4.2 Methodology
4.2.1 Preparation of Fe3O4 MNPs
In
a three-necked round-bottom flask (250 mL), a mixture
of FeCl3·6H2O (10 mmol), FeCl2·4H2O (10 mmol), and deionized water (100 mL) was
stirred and heated to about 45 °C. The stirring was continued
for 30 min until the iron salts were dissolved in the water. Then,
the temperature was increased to 85 °C under a N2 atmosphere
with rapid stirring for additional 2 h. A solution of concentrated
aqueous ammonia (15 mL, 25 wt %) was added dropwise to the solution
for 1 h. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature
and the resulting magnetic Fe3O4 NPs were collected
with an external magnet. Dark magnetic NPs were washed with water
and ethanol several times. Finally, drying was carried out at 70 °C.

4.2.2 Preparation of the Core/Shell Fe3O4@SiO2 MNPs
The prepared Fe3O4 NPs (1.0 g) were initially dispersed in water (10 mL),
ethanol (5 mL), PEG-300 (5 mL), and concentrated aqueous ammonia (1
mL, 28 wt %), using an ultrasonic bath. Then, a solution of TEOS (2
mL) in ethanol (10 mL) was loaded dropwise into the dispersion under
stirring conditions. The vigorous stirring was continued for 12 h
at room temperature. The resulting product was collected by magnetic
separation and washed with ethanol. The light-brown Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were dried at 70 °C.

4.2.3 Preparation of Fe3O4@SiO2@Vinyl
MNPs
Initially, in a three-necked
flask (100 mL) containing dry chloroform (70 mL), Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs (10 g) were charged. Then, trimethoxy(vinyl)silane
(3.54 g, 0.02 mol) was added to the reaction mixture dropwise over
a period of 10 min at room temperature. After completion of addition,
the mixture was stirred for 24 h at the refluxing temperature of chloroform.
Ultimately, the magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2@vinyl NPs were collected using an external magnet and also washed
with deionized water and ethanol several times. Relatively rough particles
were dried in a vacuum at 50 °C.

4.2.4 Preparation
of Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT Nanocomposites
in Optimum Conditions
Mixture A: In a round-bottom flask
(25 mL), Fe3O4@SiO2@vinyl NPs (1.0
g) were completely dispersed by ultrasound
in DMF (7 mL) for 10 min.

Mixture B: In a beaker (10 mL), PdCl2 (35.4 mg, 0.2 mmol) and PPh3 (130 mg, 0.5 mmol)
were dissolved in 0.5 M HCl (5 mL) by stirring at 60 °C for 2
h. The color of the mixture was changed to olive after 2 h.

Then, mixture B was added to the flask of the mixture A, and the
contents of the flask were mixed using magnetic stirring. In the next
step, TEA (0.1 mL), AgNO3 (50 mg, 0.3 mmol), NaOAc (0.01
g, 0.12 mmol), and CMI (1 mL, 8.35 mol) were added to the flask and
the contents were stirred under reflux condition for 12 h. After completion
of stirring, the desired nanoparticles were magnetically collected
and washed with distilled water and ethanol several times. The dark
Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT particles were dried
at 50 °C.

4.2.5 General Procedure for
Catalyzed Dipeptide
Construction in the Solution Phase
Initially, Ag/Fe3O4@SiO2-IT particles (0.05 g) were dispersed
in dry DCM (5.0 mL) using an ultrasonic bath for an adequate time.
Next, N-protected amino acids (2 mmol) were added into the flask.
The mixture was stirred for 30 min under a N2 atmosphere.
Then, acid-protected amino acids (2 mmol) were added and the mixture
was stirred for 3 h under a N2 atmosphere at room temperature.
After completion of the reaction, magnetic NPs were simply separated
from the reaction mixture using an external magnet, washed with methanol,
and then dried in an oven at 60 °C. The extraction process was
carried out by addition of excess dry DCM to the mixture. Then, the
DCM phase was evaporated by a rotary evaporator. The desired product
was obtained as a white powder and dried at room temperature.
