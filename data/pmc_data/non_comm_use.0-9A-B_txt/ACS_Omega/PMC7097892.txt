Using first-principles calculation and Boltzmann electron/phonon
transport theory, we present an accurate theoretical prediction of
thermoelectric properties of the α-Ag2S crystal,
a ductile inorganic semiconductor reported experimentally [Nat. Mater. 2018,17, 421].
The semiconductor α-Ag2S has ultralow thermal conductivity
associated with high anisotropy, which can be attributed to the complex
crystalline structure and weak bonding. The optimal values of the
Seebeck coefficient are 0.27 × 10–3 V/K for
n-type and 0.21 × 10–3 V/K for p-type α-Ag2S, respectively, which are comparable to those of many promising
thermoelectric materials. As a consequence, a maximum ZT value of 0.97/1.12 can be realized for p-type/n-type α-Ag2S at room temperature. More interestingly, the value of ZT can be further enhanced to 1.65 at room temperature by
applying 5% compressive strain. Moreover, we find that the electronic
thermal conductivity is a major factor limiting the ZT, which is several times the lattice thermal conductivity for n-type
α-Ag2S. Our work demonstrates the great advantage
of the α-Ag2S crystal as a ductile thermoelectric
material and sparks new routes to improve its figure of merit.

1 Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) materials, which enable the harvest of waste
heat and direct conversion into electricity, provide an effective
way for the solution of global energy crisis without producing new
contaminants.1−3 The energy conversion efficiency (η) of TE
materials is evaluated by the ratio of output electrical power (P) to the input thermal power (Q) supplied4 1  where TH and TC are temperatures of the hot end and cold end,
respectively. The term ZT is a dimensionless figure
of merit, which is defined as4 2  where S, σ, T, κp, and κe are the
Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, absolute temperature,
lattice thermal conductivity, and electronic thermal conductivity,
respectively. Obviously, the materials with high ZT will lead to the high efficiency η. For practical application,
a ZT of 1 at room temperature can have about 10%
of efficiency with a temperature difference of 200 K, and an increased ZT can realize higher efficiency.1−4

Since 1950s, great research efforts have been made to improve the ZT of TE materials. In search of high-efficient TE materials,
low thermal conductivity is essential and critical. Benefited from
the development of nanofabrication technology5 and phonon engineering,6−8 lattice thermal conductivity can
be significantly reduced, which makes some nanostructured semiconductors,
such as silicon nanowires, promising in TE application, although their
bulk counterparts are not considered as ideal candidates.9−11 On the other hand, manipulating electronic band structures also
promotes the power factor (PF = S2σ),
partially because of the favorable effect of band convergence.12−14 Moreover, novel theories emerged,15,16 including
topological surface states,17,18 the wave nature of
phonons,19,20 nanophononic metamaterials,21 rattling effect,22 topological
phonon states,23−25 and magnetic molecular materials.26 In recent years, “phonon-liquid electron-crystal”
(PLEC) materials are suggested as promising TE materials because of
their liquid-like ultralow thermal conductivity and crystal-like high
electrical conductivity.27−32 All of these efforts together consequently enhance ZT significantly since the beginning of this century.33−36

Despite past progress in TE materials, they are inorganic semiconductors,
which are usually brittle. This hinders the application of inorganic
TE materials in a flexible environment. Recently, the α-Ag2S crystal was reported to be a ductile inorganic semiconductor,
with a large compression strain > 50%.37 The ductility mechanism has been deeply discussed from chemical
bonding analysis.38 In addition, at present,
most of the commercially available TE materials contain rare and toxic
elements; therefore, Ag2S is very important because it
is negligibly toxic and naturally abundant. Recently, Wang et al.39 experimentally measured the TE properties of
Ag2S and found that Ag2S has very low thermal
conductivity. With the increase of temperature, a phase transition
occurs, resulting in a significant improvement in TE properties. In
addition, Wang et al.40 also studied the
TE properties of Ag4SSe experimentally and found that Ag4SSe is a promising TE material at the moderate temperature
range. However, the systematic theoretical studies on TE properties
of the α-Ag2S crystal have not been reported. Especially
the effects of stress on TE properties of the α-Ag2S crystal are still open questions. In this work, using first-principles
calculations and Boltzmann transport theory, we systematically investigated
the TE transport properties of the α-Ag2S crystal.
Ultralow lattice thermal conductivity is demonstrated. Combined with
the extremely large power factor originating from the high Seebeck
coefficient, high TE figure of merit ZT is realized,
which can be further enhanced through compressive loading. The physical
mechanism underlying the outstanding TE performance is discussed.

2 Theoretical Methods
All the first-principles calculations are performed using density
functional theory as implemented in the widely used Vienna ab initio
simulation package (VASP).41 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
form of the generalized gradient approximation is used for the exchange–correlation
functional.42 The crystal structure is
relaxed with a total energy convergence criterion of 10–6 eV, and the force convergence criterion is 10–4 eV/Å. The kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis is
chosen as 500 eV, and the Monkhorst–Pack k mesh is 5 × 5 × 5. The phonon spectrum is obtained by
diagonalizing the dynamical matrix, which is constructed from the
second-order interatomic force constants using the Phonopy code.43 The second-order and third-order interatomic
force constants are calculated using a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell
with 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack k meshes
and a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell with Γ point, respectively.
The lattice thermal conductivity is calculated by solving the phonon
Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) via the ShengBTE package,44 and a fine 15 × 15 × 15 q-mesh is adopted to ensure the convergence. The selection of q-mesh is large enough to obtain converged values of thermal
conductivity, as shown in Figure S1a in the Supporting Information.

The electronic transport coefficients are calculated by solving
the BTEs with the relaxation time approximation (RTA) as implemented
in the BoltzTraP code.45 The electrical
conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are calculated from 3   4   5  where f0 is the
Fermi–Dirac distribution function and Ξ(ε) is the
transport distribution function with Ξα,β(ε) = ∑kδ(ε
– εk)υkαυkβτk,
in which υkα is the αth component of the group
velocity with wave vector k, τk is the relaxation time of the carrier with wave
vector k, and ε is the energy of electrons
or holes. For obtaining the accurate group velocities and the transport
coefficient calculations to guarantee convergence, we use a more dense k-point Monkhorst–Pack mesh with 21 × 21 ×
21. The relaxation time is calculated by deformation potential (DP)
theory based on effective mass approximation.46 For three-dimensional systems, the relaxation time is calculated
as , where C3D is
the elastic modulus and can be determined by , where E is the DP constant,
which is calculated as , where ∂Eedge is the energy change at conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence
band maximum (VBM) for electrons and holes, respectively, and m* is the effective mass tensor and can be calculated as , where ℏ is the reduced Planck constant
and kB is the Boltzmann constant. C3D can be obtained through fitting the energy–strain
curves, and the DP constant can be calculated by fitting the slope
of the band edges as a function of strain. The calculated elastic
modulus, DP constant, effective mass, and relaxation time are shown
in Table 1. Once the
lattice thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient,
and electronic thermal conductivity are obtained, we can use eq 2 to calculate ZT.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity
The α-Ag2S crystal possesses a monoclinic structure
(space group P21/c (14))
with eight Ag atoms and four sulfur atoms per unit cell at room temperature.
The X–Y, X–Z, and Y–Z planes of the optimized α-Ag2S crystal
structure are shown in Figure 1a–c, respectively. The optimized lattice constants a, b, and c are 4.40,
7.89, and 9.23 Å, and the angles between primitive vectors, α,
β, and γ, are 90, 122.68, and 90°, respectively.
Based on the optimized structure, we calculate the electronic band
structure of α-Ag2S as shown in Figure 1d, which indicates that bulk
α-Ag2S is an indirect band gap semiconductor. The
band gap is 0.92 eV, in good agreement with the previously reported
value 0.9 ± 0.1 eV.37 In addition,
the VBM is at the Brillouin zone center, and the CBM is very close
to the Brillouin zone center. Therefore, α-Ag2S exhibits
optical and electrical features similar to a direct band gap material.
Similar calculation results have been found in previous studies.47,48 With strain, the electronic band structure and total energy will
change. The shifts of VBM, CBM, and total energy as a function of
strain are shown in Figure 2, which can be used to calculate the elastic modulus and DP
constant. The phonon spectrum of α-Ag2S is also calculated
by first-principles calculation, as shown in Figure 1e. There is no imaginary frequency, confirming
that the structure is dynamically stable. Moreover, it can be seen
from the phonon spectrum that a lot of low-frequency optical branches
mix with the acoustic branches along Γ–X, which implies that α-Ag2S may have a lower thermal
conductivity along the X-direction (details will
be discussed later). In contrast, the low-frequency optical branches
along Γ–Y and Γ–Z directions have a large slope, which demonstrates that
the optical branches may have important contribution to thermal conductivity
in Y and Z directions.

curves of α-Ag2S along different directions.

α-Ag2S is a layered structure, which is stacked
by a zigzag-shaped Ag–S framework. The anisotropic nature of
the structure will lead to direction-dependent physical properties,
as observed in black phosphorene.49 The
lattice thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S along different
directions is illustrated in Figure 3a. Because the α-Ag2S crystal is stable
up to 451 K, above this temperature, the α-Ag2S crystal
will be transformed into β-Ag2S, which has a body-centered
cubic structure.37 Therefore, we only show
the thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S at temperatures
below 400 K. With an increase in temperature, it is clear that the
lattice thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S along all
the three directions decreases following a T–α (α ≈ 1) dependence,
which is due to the enhanced phonon–phonon anharmonic scattering.
The fitting information is shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. Moreover, the lattice thermal conductivity
of α-Ag2S shows obvious anisotropic characteristic.
The lattice thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S along
three directions is in the order of κzz > κyy > κxx within the considered range of temperature. At
room temperature, κxx is 0.13 W
m–1 K–1, κyy is 0.29 W m–1 K–1, and
κzz is 0.33 W m–1 K–1. α-Ag2S has ultralow thermal
conductivity along the X-direction, less than half
of those in Y and Z directions,
indicating a large anisotropic thermal transport. This is because
the zigzag-shaped Ag–S framework is closely connected with
the Ag–S bonds in the Y–Z plane. However, in the X-direction, the zigzag-shaped
Ag–S framework layers are stacked together by a relatively
weak interaction, resulting in ultralow thermal conductivity. These
results imply that α-Ag2S may have the potential
for high TE efficiency.

Figure 3 (a) Lattice thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S along X, Y, and Z directions
as a function of temperature. (b) Cumulative lattice thermal conductivity
of α-Ag2S as a function of phonon frequency at room
temperature.

In calculation of phonon thermal conductivity by solving BTE, RTA
is usually adopted, in which each phonon mode relaxes independently
to equilibrium. In low-dimensional materials, RTA of the BTE may underpredict
the thermal conductivity50,51 because the collective
phonon excitations are starting to be responsible for heat transport.52,53 Unlike RTA, the exact solution of the BTE with mode-dependent phonon–phonon
interactions can provide the correct thermal conductivity in nanomaterials.
We performed thermal conductivity calculation using both RTA and full
iterative solution of the linearized BTE and found that the thermal
conductivity predicted from these two methods is identical, as shown
in Figure S1b. This reveals that the collective
phonon excitation is trivial in the α-Ag2S crystal,
and phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering is dominated in the scattering
process, consistent with the T–1 dependence as shown in Figure S2. In the following, the results of lattice thermal conductivity are
obtained from RTA calculation.

In order to further understand the origin of the anisotropy in
the thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S, we calculate
the cumulative lattice thermal conductivity as a function of phonon
frequency at room temperature, as shown in Figure 3b. For κxx, we can find that the low-frequency acoustic phonons dominate heat
transport. Moreover, from Figure 1e, the boundary frequency of acoustic phonons along
Γ–X is 1.60 THz, which coincides with
the cumulative lattice thermal conductivity of κxx as a function of phonon frequency. For κyy and κzz, the boundary frequencies of acoustic phonons are 0.85 THz and 1.12
THz, respectively, as shown in Figure 1e. However, from Figure 3b, it can be seen that the phonons at frequencies ranging
from 1.12 to 3.79 THz also contribute significantly to thermal conductivity.
This means that the low-frequency optical phonons also play an important
role in thermal transport along Y and Z directions because the low-frequency optical phonons along Γ–Y and Γ–Z have large group
velocity, as shown in Figure 1e. Moreover, among these three different directions, the plateau
region at frequencies ranging from 3.79 to 6.50 THz in Figure 3b corresponds to the band gap
of the phonon spectrum in Figure 1e, and the high-frequency optical phonons at frequencies
ranging from 6.50 to 9.38 THz also have non-negligible contributions.

3.2 High TE Figure of Merit ZT
We are now in a position to explore the TE transport properties
of α-Ag2S by using the Boltzmann transport theory
combined with DP theory. The electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient,
power factor, electronic thermal conductivity, and ZT of α-Ag2S along different directions as a function
of the chemical potential at room temperature are shown in Figure 4. From Figure 4a, we can see that the electrical
conductivity increases with increasing chemical potential for both
p- and n-type α-Ag2S. Here, the p- and n-type samples
correspond to the negative and positive chemical potential, respectively.
The electrical conductivity for n-type α-Ag2S is
much larger than that for the p-type counterpart, which is originated
from the longer relaxation time of electrons than holes, as shown
in Table 1. In addition,
the electrical conductivity of p-type α-Ag2S along
the Z-direction is larger than that along the other
two directions. However, for n-type α-Ag2S, the maximum
electrical conductivity is arrived along the X-direction.
These results are consistent with the calculated relaxation time of
carriers, as shown in Table 1. Compared with the obvious orientation-dependent electrical
conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient only has slight orientation
dependence, as shown in Figure 4b. Moreover, the optimal values of the Seebeck coefficient
are 0.27 × 10–3 V/K for n-type and 0.21 ×
10–3 V/K for p-type samples, as shown in Table 2, respectively, which
are comparable to those of many promising TE materials. For example,
the theoretical optimal value of the Seebeck coefficient is about
0.2 × 10–3 V/K for p-type NbFeSb,54 0.6 × 10–3 V/K for bulk
SnSe,55 and 0.24 × 10–3 V/K for bulk Bi2Te3.56 In order to offer the most fair comparison with other materials,
here we only select theoretical values from calculations with the
similar level of accuracy. Recently, Wang et al.40 found that the theoretical optimal carrier concentration
for the maximal ZT of Ag4SeS is about
2.0 × 1018 cm–3, and the corresponding
Seebeck coefficient is about 0.2 × 10–3 V/K,
which is consistent with our calculated value.

factor, (d) electronic thermal conductivity, and (e) ZT of α-Ag2S as a function of the chemical potential
at 300 K.

N	0.429	0.77	0.065	0.273	4.826	0.963	0.328	1.12	
The power factor, which is the product of the electrical conductivity
and square of Seebeck coefficient, has a higher peak value for n-type
than that for the p-type counterpart, as shown in Figure 4c. For n-type α-Ag2S, the maximum power factor appears along the X-direction, with a value of 18.13 × 10–3 W/m
K2. On the other hand, for p-type α-Ag2S, the maximum power factor appears along the Z-direction,
only about 1.95 × 10–3 W/m K2. For
comparison, the maximum power factor (theoretical value) of p-type
NbFeSb is about 11 × 10–3 W/m K2 at room temperature,54 and the maximum
power factor (theoretical value) of bulk Bi2Te3 is about 6 × 10–3 W/m K2 at room
temperature;56 both of them are regarded
as a good TE material with high power factor.

As shown in Figure 4d, the trend of electronic thermal conductivity is similar to that
of the electrical conductivity because the charge carriers are also
heat carriers. Based on the obtained power factor, electronic thermal
conductivity, and phonon thermal conductivity, we calculate the ZT of α-Ag2S along three directions as
a function of the chemical potential at room temperature, as shown
in Figure 4e. For p-type
α-Ag2S, the maximum ZT along X, Y, and Z directions
is 0.32, 0.11, and 0.97, respectively. The ZT along
the Z-direction is much higher than that along the
other two directions because of the much higher power factor. For
n-type α-Ag2S, the maximum ZT can
reach 1.12 along the Z-direction, which is also higher
than that along X and Y directions.
Although the power factor at the chemical potential corresponding
to the maximum ZT along the Z-direction
is lower than that along the X-direction (4.826 ×
10–3 W/m K2 vs 6.417 × 10–3 W/m K2), the electronic thermal conductivity along the Z-direction (0.96 W/m K at the chemical potential corresponding
to the maximum ZT) is much lower than that along
the X-direction (2.46 W/m K at the chemical potential
corresponding to the maximum ZT), as shown in Figure 4d and Table 2, which results in the higher ZT.

It is worth emphasizing that although the power factor of α-Ag2S is significantly high, the figure of merit ZT is not outstanding among the promising TE materials reported in
recent years3,4 because of the relatively high
thermal conductivity. As shown in Figure 3, the lattice thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S is very low, benefited from the complex crystalline structure
and weak bonding. Therefore, the major bottleneck in promoting its
TE figure of merit is the high electronic thermal conductivity. For
example, for n-type α-Ag2S, its X-direction electronic thermal conductivity is up to 2.46 W/m K at
the chemical potential corresponding to the peak value of ZT. This is about 20 times the lattice thermal conductivity
and is much higher than the electronic thermal conductivity of usually
studied TE materials, for instance, 0.23 W/m K for Bi2Te3,56 1.5 W/m K for Mg2Si1–xSnx solid solutions,57 and 1 W/m K
for the ZrSe2/HfSe2 superlattice monolayer.58 This indicates that the dominated bottleneck
that hinders the improvement of TE performance of α-Ag2S is the high electronic thermal conductivity.

It is noteworthy that the ZT value of α-Ag2S measured at room temperature by Wang et al.39 is very low. This is due to the low carrier concentration
in the experimentally studied samples, which is about 1.2 × 1014 cm–3 for n-type α-Ag2S samples. However, the optimal carrier concentration of n-type α-Ag2S for the maximal ZT from our theoretical
calculation is about 0.77 × 1019 cm–3, as shown in Table 2. Therefore, higher ZT value can be expected in
the experiment by increasing the carrier concentration of n-type α-Ag2S. Recent research shows that the maximal ZT value of Ag4SeS is about 0.6 at 373 K,40 which agrees with the ZT value of n-type
α-Ag2S along the Y-direction calculated
at room temperature (ZTyy = 0.56).

3.3 Compressive Strain Effect on Lattice Thermal
Conductivity
The experiment shows that α-Ag2S exhibits a metallic-like ductile behavior at room temperature and
can also bear large compressive deformation along the X-direction. Next, we explore the structural stability of α-Ag2S under compressive strain along the X-direction.
The compressive strain is defined as ε = (L0 – L)/L, where L is the strained lattice constant along the X-direction and L0 is the corresponding
original lattice constant, respectively.

As shown in Figure 5, the structure is
stable until ε = 5%. With further increase in strain, the out-of-plane
acoustic (ZA) mode decreases, and slight imaginary frequency starts
to appear along the Γ–X-direction when
ε = 10%. It is worth noting that the previous experiment has
shown that α-Ag2S exhibits an extraordinary metallic-like
ductility with above 50% compressive plastic deformation, which comes
from the slip between layers.37,38 However, slip between
layers is not considered in our study, causing the appearance of imaginary
frequency with 10% compressive strain. Our results are meaningful
under small deformation (ε ≤ 10%). In addition, we also
find that α-Ag2S along the Y-direction
has a negative Poisson’s ratio and that along the Z-direction has a positive Poisson’s ratio with the increasing
strain along the X-direction. The changes of lattice
constant with increasing strain are shown in Figure S3.

Figure 5 Phonon spectrum of α-Ag2S under compressive strains
of (a) 0%, (b) 2%, (c) 5%, and (d) 10%, respectively.

Next, we studied the effect of X-direction compressive
strain on the thermal transport properties of α-Ag2S, as strain is a widely adopted method to manipulate TE properties
of materials.59Figure 6a shows the lattice thermal conductivity
along different directions under compressive strains of 0%, 2%, and
5% at room temperature, respectively. It is clearly shown that the
thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S decreases with the
increase of compressive strain and then increases along three directions.
α-Ag2S under 2% compressive strains achieves the
lowest lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, the same phenomenon
exists at other temperatures, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 6 (a) Lattice thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S along X, Y, and Z directions
under compressive strains of 0%, 2%, and 5% at 300 K, respectively.
(b) Phonon scattering rate of α-Ag2S under different
compressive strains at room temperature.

Figure 7 Lattice thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S along X, Y, and Z directions
under compressive strains of 0%, 2%, and 5% at (a) 100 K, (b) 200
K, and (c) 400 K, respectively.

In order to explore the underlying physics, we calculate the phonon
group velocity and phonon scattering rate under different compressive
strains, as shown in Figures 8 and 6b, respectively. As shown in Figure 8, under compressive
strain from 2% to 5%, the group velocity of the three acoustic phonon
branches changes slightly, showing that the harmonic effect does not
have the dominant role. However, the compressive stress can significantly
affect the phonon scattering rate of α-Ag2S, as shown
in Figure 6b. With
an increase in compressive strain from 0% to 2%, the scattering rate
in the frequency range of 0–3 THz changes slightly. However,
in the frequency range of 6.5–7.5 THz, the phonon scattering
rate suddenly jumps, indicating a surprisingly giant anharmonic scattering,
resulting in the reduction in thermal conductivity. With a further
increase in compressive strain to 5%, phonon scattering rates in both
high-frequency and low-frequency regions decrease, consequently increasing
the lattice thermal conductivity. Therefore, the lattice thermal conductivity
of α-Ag2S can be controlled by applying compressive
stress through manipulating the phonon scattering rate.

Figure 8 Phonon group velocity of α-Ag2S under compressive
strains of (a) 0%, (b) 2%, and (c) 5%, respectively.

3.4 Highly Tunable ZT Driven
from Ductility
Finally, we study the influence of compressive
strain on TE properties of α-Ag2S along the Z-direction because the ZT along the Z-direction is the largest compared with that along the
other two directions. The TE transport coefficients with respect to
the compressive strains of 0%, 2%, and 5% as a function of the chemical
potential are shown in Figure 9. From Figure 9a, we can find that the electrical conductivity decreases with increasing
compressive strain. In order to explain this phenomenon, the electronic
band structures and electronic density of states (DOS) under different
strains are provided in Figures 10 and 11, respectively. We can
find that the dispersion of the valence band decreases with the increase
of stress, and at the same time, the band gap increases gradually
with the increase of strain. Both of them reduce the electrical conductivity.
Moreover, it is interesting to find that the degeneracy of the energy
band valley can be increased by compressive strain, and the convergence
of energy band appears under the compressive strain of 5%, which is
a striking mechanism to increase the Seebeck coefficient,4 as shown in Figure 9b.

Figure 11 Electronic DOS of α-Ag2S under compressive strains
of (a) 0%, (b) 2%, and (c) 5, respectively.

From Figure 11,
we also can find that the decrease of valence band dispersion and
the degeneracy of energy band valley lead to the rapid increase of
electron DOS near the valence band edge, which is beneficial to the
improvement of Seebeck coefficient. Therefore, the power factor arrives
at the maximum value at the compressive strain of 5% for p-type α-Ag2S. In addition, as the electrical conductivity decreases,
the electronic thermal conductivity also decreases because of the
Wiedemann–Franz law. Therefore, the remarkable increase of
power factor combined with the decrease of electronic thermal conductivity
leads to the remarkable increase of ZT (from 0.97
to 1.65) for p-type α-Ag2S at room temperature, as
shown in Figure 9e.
However, for n-type α-Ag2S, the compressive strain
changes slightly the value of ZT, only inducing a

4 Conclusions
In the present work, the TE properties of α-Ag2S are investigated by using first-principles calculations combined
with BTEs and DP theory. The results reveal a remarkable anisotropy
for the lattice thermal conductivity in the α-Ag2S crystal. The thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S along
the X-direction is 0.13 W/m K, and the ultralow thermal
conductivity is due to the weak interlayer interaction. Moreover,
the thermal conductivity of α-Ag2S can be controlled
by applying compressive strain to control the phonon–phonon
scattering rate. In addition, we also find that α-Ag2S has excellent TE properties, where the value of ZT can reach 0.97 for p-type and 1.12 for n-type α-Ag2S in the Z-direction at room temperature. Moreover,
the value of ZT can be further enhanced to 1.65 at
room temperature by applying 5% compressive strain. This is due to
the increased Seebeck coefficient and reduced electronic thermal conductivity.
