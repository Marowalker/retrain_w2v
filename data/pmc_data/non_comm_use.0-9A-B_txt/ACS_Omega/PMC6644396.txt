In this report, the
interaction between a phenanthrene–pyrene-based
fluorescent probe (PPI) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), a transport
protein, has been explored by steady-state emission spectroscopy,
fluorescence anisotropy, far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD),
time-resolved spectral measurements, and molecular docking simulation
study. The blue shift along with emission enhancement indicates the
interaction between PPI and BSA. The binding of the probe causes quenching
of BSA fluorescence through both static and dynamic quenching mechanisms,
revealing a 1:1 interaction, as delineated from Benesi–Hildebrand
plot, with a binding constant of ∼105 M–1, which is in excellent agreement with the binding constant extracted
from fluorescence anisotropy measurements. The thermodynamic parameters,
ΔH°, ΔS°,
and ΔG°, as determined from van’t
Hoff relationship indicate the predominance of van der Waals/extensive
hydrogen-bonding interactions for the binding phenomenon. The molecular
docking and site-selective binding studies reveal the predominant
binding of PPI in subdomain IIA of BSA. From the fluorescence resonance
energy transfer study, the average distance between tryptophan 213
of the BSA donor and the PPI acceptor is found to be 3.04 nm. CD study
demonstrates the reduction of α-helical content of BSA protein
on binding with PPI, clearly indicating the change of conformation
of BSA.

Introduction
The interaction and
energetics of protein binding toward small
molecules are largely dependent on the microenvironment and molecular
architecture arising due to folding/unfolding or even change of the
protein structure. The remarkable properties of a small molecule in
such a microenvironment bear information related to the binding site,
which is essential for drug development and many other investigations.1−4

Model globular proteins, such as serum albumins, are important
transport proteins and are found plentiful in plasma.5−8 Bovine serum albumin (BSA), a large globular protein (65 000
Da), contains 583 amino acid residues in a single chain.9 The three domains with different surface charge
densities impact BSA adsorption on charged surfaces.10,11 As for example, the presence of both positively charged residues
(lysine and arginine) and negatively charged amino acids (glutamic
acid and aspartic acid) on BSA can result in electrostatic interactions
with both negatively and positively charged surfaces, respectively.12,13 Because of the presence of a negatively charged domain, BSA is involved
in (a) binding with water, salts, fatty acids, vitamins, and hormones
and carries them between tissues and cells, (b) removing toxic substances,
including pyrogens, from the medium, (c) solubilizing lipids and is
a blocking agent in western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
applications, and (d) solubilizing other proteins (e.g., labile enzymes).
BSA is readily soluble in water and can only be precipitated in the
presence of high concentrations of neutral salts such as ammonium
sulfate. However, albumin is readily coagulated by heat. So, it is
apparent that the BSA can bind a large variety of bioactive molecules
by various noncovalent interactions such as hydrophobic, hydrophilic,
and ionic interactions. Tryptophan (Trp) 134 and Trp 213 are the two
Trp residues present in BSA. It has three domains I, II, and III,
each consisting of two subdomains A and B.

The major binding
sites of BSA are localized in subdomains, IIA
and IIIA, known as site I and site II.14,15 To infer the
protein interaction site with small molecules, site marker fluorescent
probes are generally utilized. A great deal of research activities
on the structure and function of serum albumins are reported in the
literature.16−27 Nowadays, it is of interest to develop and use special polarity-sensitive
fluorescent probes. The main focus of the present work deals with
the fluorescence emission and binding aspects of a synthetic fluorescent
probe, a phenanthrene–pyrene based conjugate (PPI), in the
hydrophobic milieu of a globular protein, BSA, under physiological
conditions.

The novelty of the present study stems from the
fact that the phenanthrene
imidazole molecules28 act as potential
selective biomarkers for inhibition of various enzymatic processes.
Here, pyrene moiety has been incorporated with phenanthrene imidazole
core as a fluorophore unit to validate the binding proficiency with
BSA. The presence of an aryl-heteroatom bond, particularly the C–N
bond, is significant for showing different biological activities.29

Results and Discussion
PPI was synthesized
from phenanthrene-9,10-dione, 1-pyrene carboxaldehyde,
and ammonium acetate in glacial acetic acid, as shown in Scheme 1, and characterized
by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) (Figure S1), 13C NMR (Figure S2), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Figure S3), and infrared (Figure S4) spectroscopy.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of PPI
Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–vis) Absorption Study
Absorption spectral study is a useful tool to explore the structural
variations and to analyze the complex formation between the protein
and probe in solution.30 UV–vis
titrations were carried out at 5 μM BSA concentration, gradually
increasing the concentration of PPI (0–25 μM) in aqueous
buffer solution. The absorption spectral changes of BSA with a gradual
change in the concentration of PPI are shown in Figure 1. Though PPI has no absorption at 280 nm,
gradual addition of PPI results in an increase in absorbance of BSA
at 280 nm, with contemporary growing of an absorbance peak at 380
nm due to PPI. The pattern of the absorption spectra at 280 nm also
changes with the increase in the concentration of PPI. This observation
supports the complexation between PPI and BSA.

changes of BSA (5 μM) with incremental
addition of PPI (0–25 μM) at 25 °C. (B) Inset: absorbance
plot at 280 and 380 nm as a function of PPI concentration.

Fluorescence Emission Study
Interaction
between the
protein and probe is well-characterized by the investigation of steady-state
fluorescence emission technique. To follow the PPI—BSA interaction,
fluorescence titrations were performed at 20 μM PPI concentration
in aqueous medium with the incremental addition of BSA. The emission
maximum of PPI was shifted from 476 to 457 nm in 70 μM BSA solution
with progressive enhancement of the fluorescence intensity (Figure 2A) when PPI was excited
at 380 nm. The fluorescence intensity variations and λemmax of PPI as a
function of the BSA concentration are more clearly exhibited in Figure 2B, which represents
a steep variation of λemmax up to 15 μM BSA, followed by attainment
of a tableland region, and this fact is a clear indication for an
ample modification of the surrounding of PPI within the protein heterogeneous
microenvironment.

Figure 2 (A) Emission spectra of PPI (20 μM) with the gradual
addition
of BSA (0–70 μM) at 25 °C. (B) Plot of relative
variation (F/F0) of the
emission intensity and emission maximum (λemmax) of PPI against BSA concentration.

This noticeable blue shift with
a concomitant increase in the fluorescence
intensity is caused by the alteration in the position of PPI from
a more polar aqueous phase to a more hydrophobic protein environment
when PPI binds with BSA. BSA fluorescence comes from the presence
of three amino acid residues namely, tyrosine (Tyr), Trp, and phenylalanine.
In particular, Trp fluorescence is used to monitor the changes in
the structural conformation of the BSA protein and to interpret the
local environment of BSA-bound PPI.31−33 There are two Trp moieties
in BSA, that is, Trp 134 and Trp 213, which are located in subdomains
IB and IIA, respectively. Trp 134 is well-exposed to the hydrophilic
region, whereas Trp 213 resides in a hydrophobic cavity of the BSA
protein.34,35

BSA shows a strong fluorescence maximum
at 342 nm in aqueous buffer
solution when the excitation of BSA is made at 295 nm.36 Excitation at 295 nm was selected to minimize
the contribution of the Tyr residue present in BSA. To find out the
binding constant for BSA–PPI interaction, in another experiment,
the fluorescence titration was performed at 10 μM BSA concentration
with the gradual addition of PPI leading to saturation. Figure 3A shows that the emission intensity
of BSA is decreased considerably along with a small blue shift of
λemmax from 342 to 338 nm with increasing PPI concentration, which in turn
implies that PPI binds strongly with BSA and also indicates that the
microenvironment around Trp moieties present in BSA is modified on
interacting with PPI.37 There is an important
observation that apart from the quenching of emission intensity of
BSA at 342 nm, a new emission band is developed at 461 nm. The intensity
of this emission band is progressively enhanced with the increasing
concentration of PPI. The presence of an isoemissive point at 420
nm is an indication of the equilibrium between the free and bound
forms of PPI. Inset of Figure 3A vividly shows the emission intensity variation at 342 and
461 nm as a function of PPI concentration.

respectively, as a function of the PPI concentration. (C) Representative
Benesi–Hildebrand plot for 1:1 complexation of BSA with PPI.
λex for BSA is 295 nm.

Probe-Protein Binding Study
The binding of PPI with
BSA can be explained by eqs 1 and 2, considering 1:1 complexation
between them. 1   2  where KBH represents
the association constant. The data obtained from the spectrofluorimetric
titration of a fixed concentration of BSA with the increasing concentration
of PPI are further investigated to find out the binding constant by
adopting Benesi–Hildebrand equation.38 3  where ΔFmax = |F∞ – F0| and ΔF = |Fx – F0|. F0, Fx, and F∞ indicate
the emission intensities of BSA in the native state, at an intermediate
PPI concentration, and at a PPI concentration when the interaction
is saturated, respectively. |F∞ – F0|/|Fx – F0|
versus 1/[PPI] plot displays a linear variation (Figure 3C), validating the accuracy
of eq 3, and supports
the 1:1 complexation between PPI and BSA. The 1:1 binding of PPI with
BSA was also confirmed by Job’s plot analysis using the emission
spectral data. In this method, the emission data were recorded by
changing the PPI:BSA molar ratio, whereas the total molar concentration
of PPI and BSA was constant.39 The Job’s
plot for PPI–BSA, that is, the difference in the emission intensity
at 342 nm versus the mole fraction of PPI (Figure S5), intersected at 0.491, showing the number of PPI molecules
binding to BSA to be around unity. The KBH value, evaluated from the reciprocal of the slope 1/KBH, and the corresponding free energy change (ΔG) accompanying the binding process are presented in Table 1, implying strong
complexation between PPI and BSA.40

Fluorescence Anisotropy
Study
To gather information
about the rigidity of the surrounding environment of a probe, fluorescence
anisotropy measurement is a useful experiment.41 It also gives information regarding the boundary to which
the rigid environment obstructs the rotational mobility of the probe.
Enhancement of anisotropy values reflects an increase in the rigidity
of the environment around a fluorescent probe. The change in the anisotropy
values of PPI with a change in the BSA concentration in aqueous buffer
medium is represented in Figure 4A. Primarily, a rapid enhancement of the anisotropy
value from 0.067 to 0.235, till the addition of 8 μM BSA, was
observed; then, the increase was gradual to a value of 0.284 till
the addition of 40 μM BSA. The increasing value of anisotropy
clearly indicates the fact that substantial restriction is imposed
on the free motion of PPI molecules with the gradual addition of BSA,
and this can be only possible if BSA strongly binds with PPI. The
maximum anisotropy value, 0.293, was obtained at 60 μM BSA,
and after that, the levelling off of the anisotropy values was observed,
which in turn reflects the saturation of association between PPI and
BSA.

at 25 °C. λex = 380 nm and λem = 475 nm for PPI. (B) Plot of 1/fB vs
1/[BSA] for evaluating the binding constant of the PPI–BSA
composite from the anisotropy data.

In accordance with Ingersoll and Strollo42 method, the binding constant of the PPI–BSA composite
can
be ascertained by adopting the following equation 4  where Kb denotes
the apparent binding constant of the PPI–BSA composite. fB corresponds to the fractional fluorescence
contribution of PPI bound to BSA, as shown in eq 5. 5  where the anisotropy
values of bound BSA–PPI
and free PPI are denoted by rB and rF, respectively. The correction factor, R, that is, the ratio of IB and IF, is taken into consideration to confirm the
fact that PPI experiences fluorescence intensity variation on binding
with BSA. The double reciprocal plot of 1/fB versus 1/[BSA] (Figure 4B) is a straight line, and from the slope, the
calculated value of Kb is presented in Table 1, which is in good
accordance with the value obtained from the spectrofluorimetric titration
experiment. Thus, this method sets up its practical application and
feasibility to find out the binding constant.37

8-Anilino-1-naphthalene Sulfonic Acid (ANS) Displacement Assay
To check the possible binding site of PPI on BSA, the ANS displacement
assay was carried out. The fluorescent probe ANS was used to get information
about the hydrophobic binding locations of the protein.39 In accordance with the procedure, the displacement
studies were accomplished with the introduction of ANS, maintaining
similar conditions. Figure S6 represents
the plot of F/F0 versus
PPI concentration, which clearly shows that at 20 μM concentration,
PPI has a better quenching influence on the emission intensity of
BSA than ANS, that is, PPI could quench ∼68% and ANS around
51%. The emission intensity of ANS was considerably augmented at 470
nm upon interaction with the hydrophobic regions of BSA, but when
PPI was added to the BSA–ANS composite (1:1), the emission
intensity of the composite decreased around 60%. This observation
suggested that PPI moderately contends with ANS for the hydrophobic
locations of BSA by removing the bound ANS molecules, leading to a
decrement in the emission intensity of the BSA–ANS composite.

Site-Selective Binding of PPI on BSA
The competitive
fluorescence displacement studies were executed to ascertain the BSA
binding site in which PPI is located, using two well-known drugs (warfarin
and ibuprofen). The range of the binding interaction of the PPI–BSA
composite can also be revealed by observing the fluorescence intensity
variation of the system.37 Site marker
warfarin exclusively binds at subdomain IIA of site I by hydrophobic
interaction, whereas ibuprofen precisely binds at subdomain IIIA of
site II through hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, and electrostatic interactions.15,37,43,44 Here, PPI was progressively added to the BSA–site marker
composites (1:1) in aqueous buffer solution to reveal the spectral
change with PPI. Figure 5 represents the spectral changes influenced by the presence of site
markers.

Figure 5 Effect of site markers on the PPI–BSA composite. (A) [BSA]
= [Warfarin] = 10 μM with the addition of PPI, each time 2 μM,
to a total concentration of 12 μM from curves 3–8 at
25 °C. (B) [BSA] = [Ibuprofen] = 10 μM with the addition
of PPI, each time 2 μM, to a total concentration of 14 μM
from curves 3–9 at 25 °C. λex of BSA
= 295 nm.

The introduction of warfarin site
marker into the BSA solution
significantly quenched the fluorescence intensity associated with
a red shift of λem from 342 to 358 nm (Figure 5A). Then, incremental addition
of PPI into the BSA–warfarin composite results in a gradual
decrease in the fluorescence intensity, which in turn indicates the
PPI influence on the binding of warfarin to BSA. In contrast to warfarin,
no meaningful change of BSA fluorescence intensity was observed upon
addition of ibuprofen (Figure 5B). PPI influences the quenching of fluorescence intensity
of the BSA-ibuprofen composite nearly to the same extent as in the
absence of ibuprofen (Figure 3A). Therefore, the above experimental studies and outcomes
clearly establish the fact that the binding of PPI to BSA is principally
located at subdomain IIA of site I, which indicates that Trp 213 is
inside or in the vicinity of the PPI binding site.

Study of Fluorescence
Quenching Induced by PPI
The
incremental addition of PPI into BSA solution induces the quenching
of BSA fluorescence (Figure 3A). The fluorescence quenching mechanism can be static, owing
to the ground-state association between the fluorophore and the quencher,
or dynamic because of collisional encounters between the above said
two species at the excited state. These two quenching mechanisms can
be discriminated by studying the lifetime measurements or by their
varying dependence on temperature and viscosity.45 We have performed the emission quenching of Trp present
in BSA with the incremental addition of PPI in aqueous buffer solution.
Because PPI has a considerable absorbance at ∼280 nm and to
avoid the involvement of the inner filter effect to the quenching
of BSA fluorescence, the emission intensity was corrected by taking
the following relation39,46 6  where, F and Fobs represent the corrected and observed emission
intensities,
respectively, of the sample under study. Aex and Aem denote the absorbance value
at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Figure S7 represents the emission spectrum of
PPI at λex = 295 nm. The probable fluorescence quenching
mechanism of BSA–PPI complexation was verified by analyzing
the emission data using the well-known Stern–Volmer equation45 7  where, F0 and F correspond to the BSA emission intensities
in free form
and with the successive addition of PPI, respectively. KSV represents the Stern–Volmer constant, and kq is the bimolecular quenching rate constant.
[PPI] and ⟨τ0⟩ are the molar concentration
of the quencher and the average lifetime of a BSA molecule in the
absence of PPI, respectively. The involvement of only one type of
quenching mechanism, that is, either static or dynamic, is inferred
by the linear Stern–Volmer plot. The occurrence of both the
abovementioned quenchings can be inferred, when the plot displays
an upward deviation.32,45,47−49Figure 6A displays an upward curvature, signifying the coexistence of static
and dynamic quenchings with the same quencher (PPI), and/or the extent
of quenching is high at a higher concentration of PPI. Here, F0/F is linked with [PPI] by
the modified form of Stern–Volmer equation45 8   9  where dynamic and static quenching constants
are represented by KD and KS, respectively. The first factor of the right-hand side
in eq 8 represents dynamic
quenching, whereas the second factor represents static quenching.
The presence of [PPI]2 term in eq 9 accounts for the observation of an upward
deviation at high [PPI] when both of the above said quenchings take
place for the same quencher. The observed dynamic portion can also
be ascertained by fluorescence lifetime measurements of BSA against
PPI concentration using the following equation 10  where ⟨τ0⟩
and ⟨τ⟩ correspond to the average lifetime of
BSA in native state and with the incremental addition of PPI, respectively.
The value of KD = (9.891 ± 0.4) ×
103 M–1 is obtained from the slope of
the plot ⟨τ0⟩/⟨τ⟩
versus [PPI] (Figure 6B). The value of Kq = KD/⟨τ0⟩ = (1.64 ± 0.06)
× 1012 M–1 s–1 is obtained by using the value of KD and ⟨τ0⟩ =6.01 ns. The calculated Kq value is 2 orders of magnitude greater than
the maximum diffusion-controlled Kq value,
2.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1.45 This implies that the quenching of
BSA fluorescence by PPI occurs through Coulombic resonance interaction
but not operated by the diffusion process.32 The fluorescence emission data were further studied by applying
the modified Stern–Volmer equation45,46,50 11  where f is the maximum accessible
fractional initial fluorescence of the protein molecule to the quencher. KSV and f values are determined
from the intercept and slope of the plot F0/(F0 – F) versus
1/[PPI] (Figure S8). The evaluated value
of KSV is (5.926 ± 0.007) ×
104 M–1. The calculated f value 1.54 indicates that 64.65% of BSA fluorescence is accessible
to PPI. The value of Kq is found to be
(9.73 ± 0.01) × 1012 M–1 s–1, and this high value again establishes the fact that
the quenching of BSA is not operated by the diffusion-controlled process.

fluorescence study) for the quenching of BSA (10 μM) fluorescence
by PPI at 298 K (λex = 295 nm and λem = 342 nm). (B) Time-resolved Stern–Volmer plot for the quenching
of BSA (10 μM) fluorescence by PPI at 298 K.

Analysis of BSA–PPI Binding Equilibria
and Determination
of Thermodynamic Parameters
The results obtained from the
above dynamic interaction have been utilized to isolate static and
dynamic quenchings in eq 8. Static quenching is defined by the following equation 12  where n signifies the stoichiometry
of the binding process, that is, the number of PPI molecules associated
with each BSA molecule. From Figure 6A, it is clearly observed that the contribution of
dynamic quenching, that is, the upward curvature, becomes considerable
only for [PPI] > 8 μM (molar ratio [PPI]/[BSA] > 0.8).
So, at
a PPI concentration below 8 μM, static quenching can be considered
exclusively, as evidenced from a linear dependence of F/F0 on [PPI]. The trend of linear Stern–Volmer
quenching plots for [PPI] < 8 μM at different temperatures
is exhibited in Figure 7A. By varying the temperature from 288 to 308 K, the decreasing tendency
of the quenching plot is observed, and the upward deviation becomes
insignificant. On the basis of such type of quenching plot and data,
the value of the binding constant (Kb)
and the value of n (number of binding sites) can
be calculated by using eq 13(45,51,52) 13  

Figure 7 (A) Representative linear
Stern–Volmer plots of PPI-induced
quenching of BSA (10 μM) fluorescence at low PPI concentrations
at different temperatures. (B) Double log plots for the determination
of the number of binding sites and the binding constant value of PPI–BSA
complexation at different temperatures.

Figure 7B
exhibits
the representative log[(F0 – F)/F] versus log[PPI] plot at different
temperatures, and all numerical parameters thereby obtained are tabulated
in Table S1, which shows that the Kb value decreases with increasing temperature.
Therefore, it can be expected that static interaction is a temperature-dependent
process. The high value of Kb implies
a strong binding affinity of PPI to BSA. Basically, four types of
noncovalent forces, namely, van der Waal forces, multiple hydrogen-bonding,
hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions play a vital role in the
binding of probes with proteins.49,53 To ascertain
the nature of the ground-state interaction between PPI and BSA in
terms of the aforesaid noncovalent forces relevant with the complexation
process, related thermodynamic parameters have been estimated by using
the following van’t Hoff equations54 14   15  where ΔH°,
ΔS°, and ΔG°
are the standard
enthalpy, entropy, and free energy changes, respectively, for the
binding process. R represents the molar gas constant.
The values of ΔH° and ΔS° are evaluated from the slope and intercept of the ln Kb versus 1/T plot (Figure 8). ΔG° value is then calculated by using eq 15. The values of all related thermodynamic
parameters are listed in Table S1, which
show that the value of ΔH° is highly negative
and ΔS° also carries a negative value.
This implies that the association of PPI with BSA results from the
primary contribution of van der Waals interactions, followed by the
involvement of extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between PPI
and BSA.55 Here also, a net negative value
of ΔG° implies that the interaction between
PPI and BSA is spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable.

Hoff plot for the interaction of PPI with BSA at different
temperatures.

Fluorescence Lifetime Studies
Time-resolved fluorescence
decay studies were further accomplished to explore the local microenvironment
surrounding the excited probe in the proteinous environment.17,56 To investigate the dynamics of PPI within the proteinous environment,
a nanosecond lifetime decay study of PPI was performed in the absence
and with the incremental addition of BSA. Representative decay profiles
are shown in Figure S9A. The values of
all related parameters are tabulated in Table S2. The lifetime decay profiles were fitted with a biexponential
form instead of a monoexponential form, unless the decay curve did
not fit well with the monoexponential form. The best fit for the decay
profiles was carried out with acceptable values of χ2 (χ2 within 1.0–1.1). The probe PPI in an
aqueous buffer solution is found to display a monoexponential decay
with a lifetime of 4.18 ns. Table S2 reveals
that the decay profile is changed from the mono- to biexponential
form with two lifetime values in the presence of BSA. This is an indication
toward separation of PPI into two different environments upon interaction
with BSA. Here, we choose to use the average lifetime value in place
of more emphasis on the individual fluorescence decay component in
such a biexponential form. Table S2 shows
that the average lifetime (⟨τ⟩) of PPI gradually
decreases with the incremental addition of BSA. The existence of binding
interaction is indicated by the meaningful difference in the lifetime
values between free PPI and the PPI–BSA composite.

The
lifetime decay study was also performed to explore the quenching mechanism
(i.e., whether it is static or dynamic or both) of BSA fluorescence
by PPI. Here, lifetime decay study of BSA was executed in the absence
and with the successive addition of PPI. Representative decay profiles
are shown in Figure S9B. The values of
all related parameters are incorporated in Table S3. The native BSA displays a biexponential decay profile in
an aqueous medium, with ⟨τ⟩ value of 6.01 ns having
two decay time components of 3.69 and 6.68 ns with the corresponding
relative amplitudes of 22.12 and 77.78%, respectively. This biexponential
decay pattern of the native BSA has been reported earlier and attributed
to the existence of two Trp moieties at distinct conformational states
in two different local environments.57,58 Fleming and
co-workers59 have examined the lifetime
decays of Trp by considering a model, which is based on the conformational
rotamers around the Cα–Cβ bond and the comparative charge transfer rate from indole to many
electrophiles. The three conformational rotamers of Trp are portrayed
below:

Here, the rotamer (C) signifies the faster component,
and on the
contrary, the relatively slower component generally appears from quick
interconversion of (A) and (B) rotamers. Nevertheless, the alteration
of the relatively stable (C) rotamer to either A or B form is quite
impossible on a nanosecond time scale.60−62 Furthermore, it is supposed
that the puckered conformation of the indole ring in the ground state
turns into a planar form upon photoexcitation probably due to the
delocalization of lone pairs on nitrogen, including the aromatic system.
Generally, the distortion of indole ring planarity is due to the interaction
with the quencher, implying the alteration of the microenvironment
in the vicinity of Trp, which is the primary cause for a decrease
in the lifetime value.60−62 A quick look at Table S3 reveals that the relative contribution (α2) of
the faster decay time component (τ2) progressively
decreases from 77.88 to 69.48%, and at the same time, the relative
contribution (α1) of the slower decay time component
(τ1) gradually increases from 22.12 to 31.52%, with
the increasing concentration of PPI. Table S3 also shows that the two decay components τ1 and
τ2 are gradually lowered with the increasing concentration
of PPI than the respective values for free BSA. The ⟨τ⟩
value of BSA gradually decreases from 6.01 ns in aqueous buffer solution
to 5.01 ns with the gradual addition of PPI (inset of Figure S9B). The decrease in the ⟨τ⟩
value is a clear outcome of substantial interactions between BSA and
PPI. To investigate the occurrence of dynamic quenching, a time-resolved
Stern–Volmer plot was made by using the value of average lifetime,
and it can be defined by eq 10. Figure 6B
represents the time-resolved Stern–Volmer plot of BSA bound
PPI, and it increases linearly with the PPI concentration, which in
turn implies the occurrence of dynamic quenching of BSA fluorescence.

Time-Resolved Anisotropy Decay
The study of lifetime
anisotropy decay is useful for garnering knowledge about the rotational
motion and relaxation of a fluorescent probe within the proteinous
environment.63 To acquire more information
about the neighboring microenvironment of PPI, anisotropy decay study
of PPI was performed in aqueous medium in the absence and presence
of the BSA protein. The representative anisotropy decay profiles are
exhibited in Figure 9. PPI exhibits a monoexponential decay profile with a reorientation
time of ∼494 ps, indicating a homogeneous environment around
PPI. But interestingly, the anisotropy decay profile of PPI is greatly
altered in the presence of BSA leading to a dip-and-rise pattern.
This type of pattern signifies the co-occurrence of at least two classes
of PPI populations, one with a slower rotational correlation time
(τ1r) 6.78 ns having a component (α1r) of 88% and another with a faster rotational correlation time (τ2r) 0.79 ns having a component (α2r) of 12%.
In accordance with the reported literature64−66 on the explanation
of such type of dip-and-rise pattern, the faster motion is ascribed
to the existence of solvent-exposed groups or moieties of the probe,
whereas, comparatively slower motion corresponds to the bound counterpart.
Another probable explanation can be understood in relation with the
rotational diffusion of the probe bound to two discrete binding sites
(i.e., hydrophilic and hydrophobic zones) in BSA.67,68 The study of molecular docking (under the Section of Molecular Docking Results) shows in support of
plausible location of PPI to be in the hydrophobic binding region
(i.e., in subdomain IIA of BSA). Actually, a considerable population
in the hydrophilic region (i.e., in subdomain IB of BSA) seems physically
not sound for neutral PPI. The above statement is only valid when
the components (i.e., α1r and α2r) reveal the relative PPI population in the two interaction sites.
The abovementioned data obviously show that the finding probability
of PPI in one binding site is appreciably higher than in the other
(α1r > α2r).67−71 So, the observed dip-and-rise pattern can therefore
be explained by considering the fact that the probe experiences different
types of rotational motions in the protein environment.69−71 Such type of anisotropy decay pattern has been illustrated by the
related exponential model, which links the decay parameters with the
discrete anisotropy parameters as follows64−66 16  where 17  and 18  where, the ith rotational
correlation time is indicated by θi. αi stands for the amplitude of
the ith lifetime decay component (i.e., τi). r(0) denotes the limiting
anisotropy. Generally, this type of anisotropy decay pattern has been
described64−66 from the outcome of the co-occurrence of two distinctly
different lifetime values, which validate the importance of the time-dependent
weighing factor fi(t) in narrating such anisotropy profile, as demonstrated
in eqs 16 and 17.

Binding-Distance Measurement Using Fluorescence
Resonance Energy
Transfer (FRET) between PPI and BSA
FRET is a useful spectroscopic
method to delineate the structural conformations of biological and
macromolecular systems such as closeness and comparative angular orientation
of fluorophores, association of protein–probe composite, and
so forth. The binding distance (r) between the donor
(D) and the acceptor (A) can be evaluated from this useful technique.72 The efficiency of energy transfer (E) between D and A is manifested by the considerable overlap between
the emission band of D and the absorption band of A, relative orientation
of transition dipoles of D and A, and the distance between D and A,
which is generally <8 nm.73,74 In our case, Trp residue
of the BSA protein acts as the donor unit, PPI acts as the acceptor
unit, and the shaded portion represents the spectral overlap region
between them (Figure 10). In accordance with Förster’s theory, E is defined by the following equation 19  where F0 defines
the free BSA emission intensity and F corresponds
to the emission intensity of BSA in the presence of PPI. The value
of R0 (i.e., the Förster distance
at which the effective transfer of energy is 50%) can be evaluated
by using the following relation 20  where K2 indicates
the spatial orientation factor of D and A dipole. N and φ denote the refractive index of the medium and the quantum
yield of D, respectively. The overlap integral between the emission
spectrum of D and the absorption spectrum of A (Figure 10) is represented by J, and its value can be obtained by using the following
relation 21  where, F(λ) and ε(λ)
correspond to the normalized emission intensity of D in the range
of λ to (λ + Δλ) and the molar extinction
coefficient of A at λ, respectively.75 In the present case, K2 = 2/3, N = 1.336, and φ = 0.15.50,76 According to eqs 19–21, parameters
evaluated thereby are summarized in Table 2. The distance r between
the donor unit BSA and the acceptor unit PPI after the binding interaction
was <8 nm, and 0.5R0< r < 1.5R0 infers the occurrence of
energy transfer from BSA to PPI with high possibility.77

Conformation
Investigations: Circular Dichroism (CD) Study
The variations
of the BSA secondary structure with the gradual
addition of PPI were carried out by far-UV circular dichroism (CD)
spectral studies in aqueous buffer solution, which show a typical
profile (Figure 11) having two negative bands at ∼209 and ∼222 nm, clearly
indicating the presence of an α-helix-rich secondary structure
in the BSA protein.78 These two minima
in the CD spectra arise generally because of the n → π*
charge transfer transition.79Figure 11 shows a decrement
in the CD signal with no significant shift of the peak position, implying
the PPI-induced conformational change of the native BSA regarding
the decrement of the α-helix content in BSA. The α-helix
percentage in BSA can be determined by considering the following relation63 22  where, the observed ellipticity values
(θobs in mdeg at 222 nm) are used to evaluate the
mean residue
ellipticity (MRE) value by taking the following relation63 23  where, the molar concentration of BSA is denoted
by CP. n indicates the
number of amino acid residues (583 for BSA).5−7,80,81 The cell path length
is represented by l (here 1 cm). The estimated α-helix
content in native BSA is found to be 65.08 (±3)%, which is in
good accordance with the literature value.5−7,80,81 A decrease in the α-helix
content from ∼65.08 (±3)% in the native BSA to ∼59.93
(±3)% in the presence of 4 μM PPI (inset of Figure 11) thus obviously shows a PPI-induced
perturbation of the secondary structure of BSA.

of PPI at 25 °C. The inset exhibits the estimated change in the
α-helix content (±3%) of BSA with the gradual addition

Molecular Docking Results
The crystal structure analysis
of BSA revealed that it is primarily composed of three homologous
domains (I, II, and III), and each domain contains two subdomains
(A and B).82 The major binding sites of
BSA for various probes (exogenous and endogenous) are located in subdomains
IIA and IIIA, known as Sudlow’s sites I and II, respectively.83 A number of probes or drugs are available, which
specifically bind either at site I or site II in BSA.37,84,85 We have performed molecular docking
study to find out whether the probe binds at site I or site II in
BSA and the probable interactions involved during the association.
Out of 10 different conformers, the lowest binding energy conformer
was selected for analysis. The docking results are presented in Figure 12. Panel A in Figure 12 reveals that site
I in subdomain IIA of BSA is the preferable binding site for the probe
PPI, and this has been supported from site marker experiments. The
middle panel shows the magnified view of the microenvironment around
the PPI binding site in subdomain IIA of BSA near the Trp 213 residue.
The possible hydrogen-bonded interaction between the nitrogen and
nitrogen-bonded hydrogen atoms of PPI with Arg 217 (2.7 Å) and
Asp 450 (3.2 Å) plays a crucial role in stabilizing probe-binding
(Figure 12C). In addition,
the probe is surrounded by various hydrophobic and polar residues.
Amino acid residues such as Leu 197, Trp 213, and Val 292 provided
an additional stability to the complex through hydrophobic interactions.
Moreover, a number of charged and polar residues such as Arg 198,
Arg 217, Lys 221, Lys 294, and so forth play a secondary role in stabilizing
the PPI molecule through electrostatic interactions. Thus, docking
results suggested that PPI was bound to BSA by three possible interactions,
namely hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen-bonding. According
to Zhang et al., increased hydrophobicity is a measure of increased
stability.86 The formation of the hydrogen
bond reduces the extent of hydrophilicity and causes a significant
increment in the hydrophobicity, which stabilizes the PPI–BSA
complex.87 Distance between the probe and
the Trp 213 residue was 3.4 Å (Figure 12C), and the free energy (from the docking
simulation) for the binding of PPI to subdomain IIA of BSA was found
to be −5.01 kcal mol–1. It is already known
that Trp 134 and Trp 213 residues are responsible for the intrinsic
fluorescence of BSA.31 The docking result
illustrates that the probe binds in the near vicinity of Trp 213 in
the binding pocket of site I, which in turn causes a perturbation
in the fluorescence intensity of BSA, more specifically, quenches
the emission of the Trp 213 residue. Thus, molecular docking study
supported the experimental findings from the theoretical approach.

Conclusions
Here, we report a phenanthrene–pyrene-based
fluorescent
probe (PPI) as a molecular reporter to study the microheterogeneous
environment of the BSA protein. The association between BSA and PPI
has been clearly demonstrated by the UV–vis spectral change
at 280 nm. The observed blue shift of the emission maximum along with
an increment of the fluorescence intensity is due to the movement
of PPI from a more polar aqueous environment to a more hydrophobic
protein environment. The fluorescence titration of BSA with PPI resulted
in a binding constant of (1.12 ± 0.06) × 105 M–1, which is in excellent agreement with the value obtained
from steady-state anisotropy studies. The study on fluorescence quenching
induced by PPI reveals the occurrence of both static and dynamic quenching
mechanisms. The occurrence of dynamic quenching is indicated by the
linear increase in ⟨τ0⟩/⟨τ⟩
with the increasing concentration of PPI. The ground-state complexation
between PPI and BSA is characterized by a large binding constant,
which is very sensitive to the temperature because of a negative ΔH° value. The complexation process is also associated
with a negative ΔS°, which implies that
the van der Waals interactions and hydrogen-bonding interactions play
the most significant roles in stabilizing the BSA–PPI complex.
From the FRET study, the average distance between Trp 213 of the BSA
donor and the PPI acceptor is found to be 3.04 nm, and it is close
enough for nonradiative energy transfer to occur from BSA to PPI.
The CD spectral studies imply PPI-induced conformational change of
the native BSA in terms of decrease of the α-helix content in
BSA. The site-selective binding and molecular docking studies reveal
that PPI binds with BSA at site I in subdomain IIA, that is, Trp 213
is near or within the binding site of PPI. The present fluorescent
probe having a planar structure could be utilized as a potential site-selective
biomarker for site I in subdomain IIA.

Experimental Section
Materials
All starting materials were of reagent grade.
BSA, ibuprofen, warfarin, ANS, phenanthrene-9,10-dione, and 1-pyrene
carboxaldehyde were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Deionized water from Milli-Q source was used throughout the study.

Physical Measurements
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra (4000–400 cm–1) were recorded on
a PerkinElmer RX I FTIR spectrophotometer with a solid KBr disc. The
UV–vis spectral studies were recorded on an Agilent diode array
spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453). Steady-state fluorescence spectra
were recorded on a PTI spectrofluorimeter (Model QM-40) by using a
fluorescence-free quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. The excitation
and emission slit widths were fixed at 3 nm. A Bruker 300 MHz spectrophotometer
was used to run the 1H and 13C NMR spectra in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 with trimethylsilane
as an internal standard. The electrospray ionization mass spectra
(ESI-MS+) (m/z) of the
probe was recorded on a HRMS spectrophotometer ( QTOF Micro YA263).
The time-correlated single-photon counting measurements using a picosecond
diode laser (IBH Nanoled-07) in an IBH fluorocube apparatus were used
to determine the fluorescence lifetimes. A Hamamatsu MCP photomultiplier
(R3809) was used to collect the fluorescence decay data, which were
further examined by the IBH DAS6 software. CD spectral studies were
recorded on a PC-driven JASCO J815 (Japan) spectropolarimeter.

Synthesis
of 2-(Pyren-1-yl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole (PPI)
The probe was synthesized by
the previously reported method88 with slight
modification. A mixture of phenanthrene-9,10-dione (1.04 g, 5 mmol),
1-pyrene carboxaldehyde (1.15 g, 5 mmol), and ammonium acetate (2.89
g, 37.45 mmol) were dissolved in glacial acetic acid (40 mL). Then,
the resulting solution was refluxed at 110 °C for 20 h in a nitrogen
atmosphere, during which time a yellowish green solid was formed.
An excess of deionized water (30 mL) was added to complete the precipitation.
The crude product was collected by filtration, washed with water,
and dried by suction (Scheme 1). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6):
δ in ppm 10.81 (s, 1H), 9.03 (d, 2H, J = 7.8
Hz), 8.79 (d, 3H, J = 6.63 Hz), 8.70 (d, 1H, J = 8.1 Hz), 8.60 (d, 1H, J = 7.92 Hz),
8.45 (m, 5H), 8.23 (d, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz), 7.87 (t,
4H) (Figure S1). 13C NMR (DMSO-d6): δ in ppm 147.51, 133.49, 131.25, 130.68,

125.24, 124.83, 124.28, 123.79, 123.17, 123.05 (Figure S2). ESI-MS+ (experimental): m/z: 419.1546 [C31H18N2 + H+], theoretical: m/z: 419.1548 (Figure S3). IR spectrum:
ν̃: 3454 cm–1 (−NH), 1646 cm–1 (−C=N) (Figure S4).

Experimental Solution
A 10 mM Tris
buffer solution
(100 mL) of pH 7.4 was prepared in deionized water, which was used
in all experiments. A stock solution was prepared by dissolving the
required amount of BSA (MBSA = 66 400
g mol–1) in pH 7.4 Tris-HCl buffer solution, and
the exact concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using
the molar extinction coefficient 44 000 M–1 cm–1 at 280 nm,89 whereas
the 10 mL stock solution of PPI (1.0 × 10–3 M) was prepared in dimethyl formamide because of its poor solubility
in water. Each solution was mixed properly before all spectral experiments
at 25 °C.

Molecular Docking
Simulation Study
Molecular docking
simulation studies using AutoDock (version 4.2) help to identify the
probable binding site and mode of binding of the probe PPI with BSA.
The RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 4JK4) was used as a source of X-ray crystal
structure of BSA. The Chem3D Ultra 8.0 was used to draw the probe
structure, which was further modified using Gaussian 09W and AutoDock
4.2 programs. Gasteiger partial charges were added to the probe atoms.
The nonpolar hydrogen atoms were united, and rotatable bonds were
defined. Grid maps of 126 × 126 × 126 Å grid points
and 0.403 Å grid spacing were generated using the AutoGrid program.
The default values were used for other AutoDock parameters. The Lamarckian
genetic algorithm (LGA) was used for docking calculations and the
parameters were set to 100 GA runs for each docking simulation upto
250 000 energy evaluations. The population size was set to
150 with a crossover rate of 0.8 (LGA). For further analysis of docking
simulations, we chose the best optimized docked model with the lowest
energy, and this was best viewed in PyMOL software.
