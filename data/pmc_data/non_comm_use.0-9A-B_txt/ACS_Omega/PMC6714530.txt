Benzamide
antipsychotics such as amisulpride are dosed as racemates
though efficacy is assumed to be mediated through S enantiomer binding to D2 receptors. At prescribed doses,
the benzamides likely display polypharmacy since brain exposure should
be sufficient to engage the 5-HT7 receptors, as well. Curiously,
the studies herein reveal that racemic dosing is required to engage
both targets since the D2 receptor has an almost 40-fold
selectivity for the S enantiomer, while the 5-HT7 receptor has greater than 50-fold preference for the R enantiomer.

Introduction
There is a strong preference
for new drugs to be developed as single
enantiomers to avoid risks associated with dosing a distomer (inactive
enantiomer) along with its eutomer (active enantiomer) unless there
is a compelling reason to use the racemic mixture.1,2 As
such, when developing a new drug with a chiral center, it has become
a common practice to identify the active enantiomer and to develop
it as a chirally pure compound. The regulatory environment of the
past was less stringent, leading to a number of racemic drugs on the
market in the US and Europe.1 For example,
many members of the benzamide class of antipsychotics exemplified
by the compounds listed in Figure 1 are dosed as racemates.

Benzamide antipsychotics were developed to engage the brain
dopamine
D2 and D3 receptors (referred to collectively
as D2/3 in the text) and fall into the category of atypical
antipsychotics.3 Though never submitted
for regulatory approval in the United States, numerous clinical trials
demonstrate that the benzamide amisulpride is one of the most effective
antipsychotics on the market in Europe.4 In addition to the antipsychotic activity of amisulpride, there
are many reports of its antidepressant activity in schizophrenia and
other indications.5−7 The work of Abbas et al., consisting of rodent in
vivo studies, as well as the examination of a panel of off-target
receptors, identified the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor as the
likely mediator of amisulpride’s antidepressant activity.8

Polypharmacology occurs when one drug engages
multiple targets
that each contribute to a disease and is distinct from polypharmacy
where multiple drugs are used to engage these targets.9 As is the case with the benzamides, often, polypharmacology
is a serendipitous outcome. Nevertheless, when discovered, polypharmacology
is frequently invoked to explain the unusually high efficacy observed
with such drugs. Adding to the complexity surrounding amisulpride’s
efficacy is the racemic nature of the drug. The chiral preference
of the D2/3 receptors was determined in 2001 when Castelli
et al. reported that the S enantiomer of amisulpride
bound D2/3 nearly 40-fold more potently than the R enantiomer.10 The enantiomeric
preference of the 5-HT7 receptor for amisulpride is reported
in this work.

LB Pharmaceuticals is developing a new generation
of N-alkylated
benzamide antipsychotics. Promising preclinical results were obtained
with LB-102, an N-methylated analogue of amisulpride, and with LB-103,
the N-methylated S enantiomer of amisulpride11,12 (Figure 2). The 5-HT7 receptor stereo preference played a key role in deciding
which asset to advance. If the 5-HT7 receptor, like the
D2/3 receptors, displayed a preference for the S enantiomer, then the logical choice would be to advance
chirally pure LB-103. Conversely, if the 5-HT7 receptor
was selective for the R enantiomer (LB-104), then
to harness the benzamide polypharmacology, we will advance the racemic
compound LB-102, which being two distinct compounds would define the
effect as polypharmacy rather than polypharmacology.

Results and Discussion
Receptor binding studies were conducted in a cell-based assay containing
overexpressed target receptors and a modified cyclic nucleotide-gated
ion channel.13

Receptor engagement
by the antagonists was determined from an analysis
of observed response to a concentration matrix of natural ligands,
dopamine or serotonin, versus a gradient of concentrations of antagonists.
The apparent affinity Kd(apparent) of the natural ligand
was calculated at fixed concentrations of the antagonist and then
replotted as a function of antagonist concentration (Figure 3). These studies are ligand
displacement assays and conform to the Cheng–Prusoff relationship
for competitive inhibition.14 When (R), (S), and (rac) compounds were examined
against the receptor, eqs 1–3 were fit globally to the results.
Kd refers to the binding affinity of the natural ligand and KI refers to the binding affinity of the antagonist 1   2   3  As seen in Figure 3, the displacement assays are consistent
with a competitive Cheng–Prusoff relationship since they produce
the expected linear relationships between apparent ligand affinities
and antagonist concentrations. The antagonist binding affinities are
presented in Table 1. The D2 receptor prefers the S benzamide
enantiomer having an almost 40-fold preference for LB-103 v LB-104,
comparable to the amisulpride preferences reported by Castelli et
al.10 As well, within experimental uncertainty,
LB-102 and amisulpride bind to the D2 receptor with a Kd
of 1 nM. In contrast, the 5-HT7 receptor has a striking
50-fold preference for the R enantiomers of the benzamides.
The racemic benzamide affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor is
approximately 30-fold weaker than its D2 receptor affinity
though potentially still pharmacologically relevant.

Amisulpride effectively moderates
schizophrenia’s negative
symptoms at moderate daily doses (50–300 mg) and the positive
symptoms at higher daily doses (800–1600 mg).15 The human pharmacokinetics of amisulpride are dose-linear
over its therapeutic dose range, and its plasma PK and brain D2/3 occupancies are reported.15,16 PK–D2/3 occupancy models of amisulpride and LB-102 were generated12 by combining reports on amisulpride human PK,15,16 D2/3 receptor occupancy,16 rat dose–D2/3 receptor occupancy and behavioral
studies,17 and in-house rat PK studies.
The absence of in vivo 5-HT7 receptor occupancy studies
in animals or humans limits our ability to reliably model 5-HT7 in vivo occupancy since in vitro binding affinities rarely
translate well to in vivo occupancies. Our previous work predicts
that an 800 mg dose of amisulpride will produce a peak brain concentration
of 20 ng/g, 10 h post dose, which provides a 90% D2/3 occupancy.
Our work determined an effective human brain D2/3 EC50 of 1.6 ng/g. Extrapolating the in vitro differences in potency
between D2 and 5-HT7 to approximate in vivo
5-HT7 EC50 predicts a 5-HT7 occupancy
of around 30% at 800 mg. Abbas reports an amisulpride KI of 11.5 nM v LSD, which would translate to a 50% occupancy
at an 800 mg dose. Reliably modeling 5-HT7 occupancy in
humans will require a competing PET ligand study, as has been done
with the D2/3 receptors.

Conclusions
In
the development of new pharmaceuticals, racemates are avoided
when possible and new drugs are preferentially developed in enantiomerically
pure form. As described in this work, the benzamide antipsychotics
present an interesting challenge to the developmental process. The
benzamides display polypharmacy if dosed as a racemate: antipsychotic
activity is provided by targeting D2/3 receptors with the S enantiomer, while antidepressant effects are provided
by targeting the 5-HT7 receptor with the R enantiomer. Based on the findings in this report, racemic LB-102
will be advanced to the clinic rather than the enantiomerically pure S LB-103.

Experimental Section
Compounds:
amisulpride (rac) and (S) enantiomers
were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, ON); amisulpride
(R), LB-102 (rac), LB-103 (S), and
LB-104 (R) were prepared by Kalexsyn (Kalamazoo,
MI): briefly, racemic amisulpride (and individual enantiomers) was
suspended in N,N-dimethylformamide
dimethyl acetal and stirred at 90 °C for 2 h; the mixture was
cooled to ambient temperature, NaBH4 was added portionwise,
and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The organic phase was removed
under reduced pressure, and the residue was extracted with dichloromethane,
washed with brine, dried, and filtered, and the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure. Purification was achieved by column chromatography
followed by recrystallization from acetone.

Compound structural
integrities were determined by proton NMR.
The purities were assessed using HPLC. All compounds possess a purity
of at least 95%. Details are available in the Supporting Information.

Receptor binding studies were
conducted by CODEX BIOSOLUTIONS using
their ACTOne system assay procedures, and details are provided on
their website.13 In brief, ACTOne cell
system contains a modified cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel as
a biosensor of cAMP activity in live cells. The channel responds to
increases or decreases in intracellular cAMP levels by coordinately
altering calcium flux, which is measured with a calcium-sensitive
dye.13 Cell lines were developed containing
overexpressed D2 dopamine receptors or 5-HT7 serotonin receptors.

Assays were conducted in duplicate in
384-well plates. The concentration
matrix consisted of five concentrations of the antagonist at 3-fold
dilutions (and a 0 concentration) versus six concentrations of natural
ligand also at 3-fold dilutions. Natural ligand binding (dopamine
for D2 and 5-HT for 5-HT7) was determined from
the response curves of natural ligand at a fixed antagonist concentration
using a four-parameter binding equation  where max = response at a saturating ligand
concentration, min = response in the absence of ligand, Kdapparent = ligand concentration producing half the maximum signal, and n = the Hill coefficient. Binding affinities for the antagonists
were determined from fits of Kdapparent versus antagonist
concentration using eqs 1–3.
