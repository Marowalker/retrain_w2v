Electrode materials are the most significant components
of lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) and play an important role in endowing them with
high electrochemical performance. The exploration of new electrode
materials and their comparative study with contemporary resources
will help the design of advanced electrodes. Here, we have synthesized
a new type of Prussian blue analogue (cerium(III) hexacyanocobaltate,
CeHCCo) and systematically explored the effect of valence states of
Fe2+ and Ce3+ on crystal structure and electrochemical
properties of final products. We demonstrate that the unbalanced charge
in iron(II) hexacyanocobaltate (FeHCCo), as opposed to that in CeHCCo,
results in more residual K+ ions, thereby leading to the
occupancy of cavities. As a result, the K+ ion-rich FeHCCo
exhibits lower capacities of 55 ± 3 and 15 ± 3 mAh g–1 at 0.1 and 1 A g–1, respectively,
compared with the K+ ion-deficient CeHCCo that exhibits
capacities of 242 ± 3 and 111 ± 3 mAh g–1 at the same current densities. This work provides a novel contribution
for the exploration of new Prussian blue analogues and bestows a newer
concept for electrode material design.

1 Introduction
Rechargeable lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) have dominated the energy
storage and conversion sector for decades.1−4 Other ion batteries such as Na+,5−8 K+,9−12 and Zn2+13,14 are being considered as alternatives
to LIBs, primarily because of the high cost of lithium resources.
However, we have a long way to go before we can commercialize the
other alternatives. In addition, the small size and lower charge density
of Li+ ions and high energy densities of LIBs make them
a promising candidate, in theory, for energy storage devices. The
study of electrode materials has largely contributed to the progress
of LIBs. Typically, the cost-effective Prussian blue analogues as
the electrode material have exhibited high potential for the fabrication
of high-performance LIBs that are used in large-scale energy conversion
and storage systems.15−18

Prussian blue analogues were synthesized as metal–organic
frameworks wherein the transition metal ions were alternately bridged
to the ends of cyanide linkers. They have served as functional materials
in various fields such as gas absorption,19,20 drug delivery,21,22 ion conductors,23−25 and catalysts.26,27 The numerous advantages such
as an intrinsic robust crystal structure, facile preparation process,
reasonable capacity, and low cost make the Prussian blue analogues
suitable for use as electrode materials in LIBs.28−30 The general
formula of Prussian blue analogues is AyP[R(CN)6]1–x□x·nH2O where
A is an alkali metal mobile cation, P is the nitrogen-coordinated
transition metal ion, R is the carbon-coordinated transition-metal
ion, and □ is [R(CN)6]n− ion vacancies (0 ≤ y ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1). In the crystal framework, eight subunits
are constructed in each unit for the Li+ ion intercalation
and deintercalation during the discharging and charging processes,
respectively. This unique structure plays a significant role in the
electrochemical reaction.31 Thus, it is
imperative to study the structure of Prussian blue analogues for their
performance as electrode materials in LIBs.

Considering that
the valence state of the final structure is dependent
on the valence state of the precursor, we report here the effect of
valence states of the initial reactants on the electrochemical properties
of the cathode materials in LIBs. To obtain a trivalent metal ion,
which is stable in aqueous solutions to match with the hexacyanocobaltate,
we synthesized cerium(III) hexacyanocobaltate (CeHCCo). Furthermore,
comprehensive characterization and analysis revealed that the residual
K+ ion content in iron(II) hexacyanocobaltate (FeHCCo)
was greater than that in CeHCCo, resulting in a significant decay
in the capacity. In addition, these two electrode materials exhibit
a surface-controlled Li-ion storage nature. This work is expected
to provide more insights for exploring not only a new type of Prussian
blue analogues but also the design of electrode materials for advanced
LIBs.

2 Results and Discussion
The synthesis
process and theoretical structures of FeHCCo and
CeHCCo are shown in Figure 1, which illustrates that there are eight subunits where Li+ ions can anchor. Fe2+/Ce3+ ions are
coordinated to nitrogen atoms of the cyanide linkers for FeHCCo/CeHCCo.
In the products, the charge neutrality requirement normally results
in some inherent vacancies of [Co(CN)6]3– clusters.32 This structural difference
is directly manifested in the optical color (Figure 1, glass vials, insets) due to the different
optical properties of the metal–cyanide–metal coordination.

process and general structural units of FeHCCo and CeHCCo.
Eight subunits are present in each unit for Li+ intercalation.
Insets show the optical images of the synthesized FeHCCo and CeHCCo
nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous solutions.

The morphology is studied by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A distinct difference
in the morphologies of FeHCCo and CeHCCo (Figure 2a,d) can be observed. FeHCCo exhibits spherical
NPs with a size of ∼20 nm, while polyhedron-shaped CeHCCo NPs
are formed with multiple sizes; the smaller FeHCCo NPs have a smooth
surface, which is further illustrated in the TEM images (Figure 2b). Correspondingly,
the CeHCCo NPs have a size larger than that of FeHCCo NPs, also displayed
in a TEM image (Figure 2e). The crystalline particles and diffraction patterns (Figure 2c,f) demonstrate
the polycrystalline feature. Furthermore, the atomic arrangement can
be observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images with an interplanar
spacing of approximately 0.44 nm for FeHCCo and 0.41 nm for CeHCCo
(Figure S1).

(c) HRTEM images of the synthesized FeHCCo
NPs and corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns.
(d) SEM, (e) TEM, and (f) HRTEM images of the synthesized CeHCCo NPs
and corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns.

Both FeHCCo and CeHCCo NPs exhibit crystallized
features, suggesting
that manifestation is independent of the initial reactants. However,
the large variation in the particle size and morphology implies that
the crystal growth is greatly dependent on the initial reactants,
which is consistent with other reports.33 The consistent elements are uniformly distributed throughout the
NPs (Figure S2), which is in accordance
with the qualitatively verified results by the energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) mapping (Figures S2b,d and S3).

The crystal structure of FeHCCo determined by X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Figure 3a) are
well indexed into a cubic structure (a = b = c = 5.2 Å). However, CeHCCo shows
an orthorhombic crystal structure with enhanced lattice constants
(a = 7.4, b = 12.9, and c = 13.7 Å) by referring to ErFe(CN)6 (PDF
card: #79-2085, Cmcm(63)), which is expected to facilitate the Li+ ions’ transfer inside the material. The characteristic
peaks of both products are well indexed in Figure 3a. A similar occurrence is where crystallization,
regardless of the initial reactants, is confirmed by the representative
characteristic diffraction peaks in the XRD spectra of both FeHCCo
and CeHCCo. The well-constructed frameworks are critical for the Li+ ion intercalation/deintercalation during the charge and discharge
processes.

Figure 3 (a) XRD, (b) TGA, (c) FT-IR, and (d) Raman spectra of the synthesized
FeHCCo (blue) and CeHCCo (black) products.

The thermal stability of the synthesized FeHCCo
and CeHCCo is examined
using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Figure 3b) by varying the temperature from room temperature
to 600 °C. The initial weight loss corresponds to the release
of zeolitic and coordinated water species.34 A sharp decrease in the weights after 450 °C indicates poor
thermal stability for FeHCCo compared with CeHCCo with a platform
until 600 °C, demonstrating more bond energy for CeHCCo than
that for FeHCCo. The loss of water (∼20% by weight) for FeHCCo
is two times more than that of CeHCCo, which is more likely due to
the fully bonded [Co(CN)6]3– by Ce3+ resulting in less coordinated water.35−37

The molecular
formulas based on Fe/Ce are deduced (based on X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) results in Table S1)
to be K0.6Fe[Co(CN)6]0.72□0.28 and K0.01Ce[Co(CN)6]0.99□0.01. The related qualitative analysis of the
constituent elements displayed in Figure S4 agrees well with the EDX results (Figures S2 and S3). A larger amount of the K+ impurity, trapped
at the subunits to balance the valence state, suggested more cyanide
vacancies in the FeHCCo NPs (0.28) than those (0.01) of CeHCCo. The
elemental amounts are further confirmed by inductively coupled plasma
(ICP, Table S2). As a sequence, the composition
of K in the FeHCCo is much higher than that in CeHCCo, which agrees
with the XRF results.

To confirm the cyanide-constructed crystal
structure, the representative
cyanide stretching bands in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) spectra are detected at around 2200 and 500 cm–1 (Figure 3c). The
H–O–H stretching band at around 1600 cm–1 and O–H stretching band at around 3400 cm–1 further verify the presence of the residual water molecules and
their coordination. The C–N band at around 1210 cm–1 in FeHCCo may be due to the coordination from atmospheric nitrogen.38

The Raman spectra (Figure 3d) of the products are obtained from 2000
to 2300 cm–1 to confirm the valence state of cyanide-bonded
metal ions as they
are sensitive to the oxidation states of the metal ions.39,40 The obvious bands at 2171 and 2192 cm–1 for FeHCCo
and 2163 and 2182 cm–1 for CeHCCo are assigned to
the stretching mode of the cyanide bridges. A small Raman shift in
the stretching mode of the cyanide bridge is exhibited when the oxidation
state of Fe2+ changes to Ce3+, which results
in a higher energy of the stretching band.41

The surface chemical compositions and coordination of the
prepared
FeHCCo and CeHCCo are measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS, Figure 4 and Figure S5). In the wide survey spectrum (Figure S5), the O 1s peak in FeHCCo exhibits
a higher intensity than that in CeHCCo directly demonstrating more
coordinated water molecules due to the [Co(CN)6]3– vacancies as per the molecular formulas we deduced. There is no
obvious difference in the deconvoluted spectra of C 1s and N 1s (Figure S5) where the cyanide functional group
within the frameworks is distinctly detected. Two pairs of doublet
peaks are exhibited in deconvoluted Ce 3d at binding energies of approximately
885 and 905 eV. The binding energy at 883 eV confirms the existing
Ce3+ ions inside the frameworks (Figure 4d). The Fe3+ in FeHCCo is more
likely due to the electron transfer from Fe2+ to Co3+ through the cyanide bridge.42−46 This electron transfer behavior can be further confirmed
by the difference in binding energy of deconvoluted N 1s (Figure S5d,f), together with the formed Co2+. Similarly, the Ce4+ ions in the deconvoluted
Ce 3d also suggest the underlying charge transfer.

and (c) Co 2p and (d) Ce 3d for CeHCCo.

Based on the above analysis, a feasible growth
mechanism for CeHCCo
NPs can be obtained. Ce3+, [Co(CN)6]3–, and K+ are the primary existing species in the initial
solution. To lower the total energy raised by the opposite charges,
the crystal growth proceeds in a directional manner for CeHCCo. The
high-valence Ce–N is expected to be more stable because of
its higher crystal field stabilization energy.47,48 With increasing time, CeHCCo with six-fold-coordinated Ce3+ possesses a promising and robust structural stability, and its growth
proceeds toward the polyhedral crystal morphology. The directional
growth can be achieved by taking advantage of the oriented assembly
enabled by the high selectivity of facet bonding as pursued by a previous
report.49 Due to the fixed vector angles
of every two facets within one family such as 90° or 180°
for {100} facets, etc., we thus infer that the CeHCCo product directionally
grows along the <110> crystallographic orientation with a 60°
vector angle. Furthermore, a similar crystal structural morphology
was found in a previous report by Lin et al., which was formed via
a controllable epitaxial growth by tuning the F– ion additive concentration in the reaction system.50 After a comprehensive analysis, we infer that our CeHCCo
product directionally grows along the <110> crystallographic
orientation
and is enclosed with 12 side facets; thus, the hexagonal structure
was finally formed.

The effect of vacancies in the FeHCCo and
CeHCCo nanocrystals on
their electrochemical properties is determined by assembling these
NPs as the active materials of the cathode in half cells. A redox
reaction is exhibited by a pair of peaks at around 3.3 V versus Li+/Li (cathodic) and 3.6 V versus Li+/Li (anodic)
in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Figure 5a,b) of both FeHCCo and CeHCCo. To ensure
that the capacity is mainly contributed by the active materials in
the subsequent measurement, a cycling test for the naked graphite
current collector is performed. The result shows a negligible capacity
value (Figure S6c,d). The distinct increases
in capacity from 55 ± 3 to 242 ± 3 mAh g–1 at 0.1 A g–1 and 15 ± 3 to 111 ± 3 mAh
g–1 at 1 A g–1 are achieved when
the initial reactant Fe2+ ion is changed into a Ce3+ ion (Figure 5c). Furthermore, an enhanced capacity retention for CeHCCo (46%)
is achieved compared with that of FeHCCo (27%) with increasing current
density from 0.1 to 1 A g–1. The charge/discharge
cycling stability displays the improved capacity for CeHCCo compared
with that of FeHCCo (Figure 5d). Furthermore, the high performance of CeHCCo can also be
demonstrated by comparing with other reported Prussian blue analogues
as shown in Table S3 where a comprehensive
improvement in both capacity and life span can be attained at a higher
current density. Typically, higher capacities are exhibited for CeHCCo
than those for both CeHCFeII with the same cation and Mn3[Co(CN)6]2 with the same anion. This
implies that the improved electrochemical capacities are mainly attributed
to this combination. In addition, one may ask the case of FeIIIHCCo. For which, FeIIIHCCo also donates highly improved
capacities compared with FeIIHCCo as shown in Table S3. This agrees that the well-matched valence
states are favorable for Li+ ion storage. Furthermore,
the residual K species in KIII0.07Fe[Co(CN)6]0.89 is also much less than that in KII0.6Fe[Co(CN)6]0.72. This further
confirms that the valence state exhibits a crucial impact on the final
K+ storage amount.18 The significant
decrease in capacity when Fe2+ is employed can be attributed
to the greater number of residual K+ ions trapped in Li+ ion sites in FeHCCo, which is almost 60 times more than that
in CeHCCo (Figure S7). Therefore, the Li+ diffusion impedance is expected to be depressed. To affirm
this, we conducted the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
measurement where the decreased impedance for both FeHCCo and CeHCCo
after the first five charge/discharge cycles reflects the infiltration
of the electrolyte into the fresh electrode (Figure S8a,b). One key point is that the CeHCCo electrode exhibits
an ∼500 ohm impedance that is much lower than ∼900 ohm
of FeHCCo (Figure S8c). The EIS curve is
studied under the assistance of the corresponding equivalent circuit,
which comprises the internal resistance (Rs) including electrode, electrolyte, electrode/current collector contact,
and current collector resistances. Furthermore, the Warburg impedance
(Zw), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and double-layer capacitance (C1) are also depicted in the provided EIS curve (Figure S8d).

0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 A g–1 and (d) cycling
measurements (discharge capacity) at a current density of 0.1 A g–1 for FeHCCo and CeHCCo.

To determine the stability of crystal structures,
we perform XRD
measurements for both FeHCCo (Figure S9a) and CeHCCo (Figure S9b) using the cathodes
cast with active materials and disassembled from the half-cells after
cycling tests. The distinct carbon peaks are derived from the graphite
paper supports. The characteristic peaks are well preserved in the
FeHCCo active material after encountering cycling tests, although
decreased peak intensities are exhibited. However, different XRD diffraction
patterns are obtained for CeHCCo implying the phase change during
the Li ion insertion and extraction.

To further confirm the
final capacity of FeHCCo and CeHCCo, CV
curves are scanned at various rates (Figure 6a,b). Well-preserved CV curves are exhibited
for both FeHCCo and CeHCCo without obvious distortions. An obvious
hysteresis for FeHCCo when scanned at higher rates is clearly shown
by the negative shift of cathodic peaks and positive shift of anodic
peaks. In other words, the hysteresis in FeHCCo can reduce the capacity
and stability of electrochemical reactions.51−59 An evaluation of the capacity contribution is analyzed by the relationship
between response currents and scan rates at a fixed voltage (3.1 V
vs Li+/Li) in CV curves (Figure 6c). The quasi-linear relationship for both
FeHCCo and CeHCCo demonstrates the surface-control-dominated Li-ion
storage mechanism. Furthermore, the higher response current for CeHCCo
demonstrates the lower impedance as measured in the EIS spectra (Figure S8a–c) assisting to increase the
capacity.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized
CeHCCo and studied the effect of
cation nodes with different valence states on the structural and Li-ion
storage electrochemical properties of both FeHCCo and CeHCCo. Both
spherical FeHCCo and polyhedral CeHCCo exhibit a polycrystalline nature.
The reduced K+ impurity and impedance result in the capacity
increase from 55 ± 3 to 242 ± 3 mAh g–1 at 0.1 A g–1 and 15 ± 3 to 111 ± 3 mAh
g–1 at 1 A g–1. This work presents
more detailed insights in terms of exploration of new Prussian blue
analogues and reactant selection for electrode material fabrication,
which undeniably pave the way for the development of advanced Li-ion
storage devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of FeHCCo and CeHCCo
FeHCCo NPs were synthesized by a coprecipitation method by simultaneous
dropwise addition of 100 mL of FeCl2 (0.03 M) (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 100 mL of K3[Co(CN)6] (0.03 M, Sigma-Aldrich)
to 100 mL of H2O under constant stirring; a milky white
precipitate ensued immediately. After sonicating for 30 min, the suspension
was allowed to sit for 1 h. The precipitate was separated and rinsed
several times with a large amount of deionized water and ethanol.
It was then dried in an oven at 60 °C for further use. The synthesis
of CeHCCo was carried out in a similar manner, except that cerium(III)
nitrate hexahydrate (Samchun, 0.03 M) was used as the initial reactant
and the codeposition process was performed at 80 °C. During the
synthesis of CeHCCo, a transparent solution, without any deposition,
was obtained at room temperature, which suggested the requirement
of heating treatment. In the deliberation for the appropriate heating
temperature, the maximum value attainable for aqueous solutions is
100 °C. However, a transparent solution obtained at 60 °C
indicates that a higher temperature is warranted. We thus synthesized
CeHCCo at 80 °C, and a white deposition was obtained.

4.2 Physical Characterization
Structural
study was performed using XRD (D8-Advance) equipped with Cu Kα
radiation at a fixed incident angle of 2°, XPS (PHI 5000 VersaProbe)
using an Al Kα source (Sigma probe, VG Scientifics), Raman spectroscopy
(inVia Raman microscope), and FT-IR (Nicolet iS50) spectroscopy. The
morphology and constitution were studied using FE-SEM (SUPRA 55VP),
TEM (Tecnai F20), and EDX. The constitutions of the prepared FeHCCo
and CeHCCo were studied by XRF (ZSX-PRIMUS) and TGA, which was carried
out under a N2 flow from room temperature to 600 °C
at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. ICP spectroscopy
was performed for confirming the elemental amounts of the products.
Each product (0.1 g) was dissolved into 35 mL of NaOH solution for
ICP measurements.

4.3 Electrode Preparation
Briefly, a
slurry containing FeHCCo or CeHCCo NPs, carbon black (Super P Li),
and poly(vinylidene)difluoride in a mass ratio of 7:2:1 was prepared
by manually grinding the materials and dispersing them in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP). Before the injection of
NMP, the ground mixture was sufficiently dried overnight in vacuum
at 80 °C. The weight of the ground mixture was measured before
and after vacuum drying to ensure that water was eliminated as much
as possible. The working electrode with a mass loading of ∼3
mg cm–2 was prepared by spreading the slurry on
a graphite paper current collector (Alfa Aesar) followed by drying
overnight in vacuum at 60 °C.

4.4 Electrochemical Characterization
To perform the electrochemical measurements, we prepared a two-electrode
half-cell containing the working electrode and sufficient lithium
metal (reference electrode) in an argon-filled glove box. LiPF6 was flooded into a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate
and diethylene carbonate.

The EIS of the electrode was measured
with an Im6ex ZAHNER impedance measuring instrument in a half-cell
with the frequency range being 10 mHz to 1 MHz under a voltage amplitude
of 10 mV.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed
between
2.2 and 4.5 V versus Li+/Li at current densities of 0.1,
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 A g–1. The long-term galvanostatic
charge/discharge cycling tests of FeHCCo and CeHCCo were conducted
at 0.1 A g–1 up to 100 cycles. All of the current
densities and specific capacities reported in this work were calculated
based on the weight of the active material (FeHCCo or CeHCCo).
