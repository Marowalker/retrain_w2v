Introduction
Carbon–heteroatom
bond-forming reactions have a great significance
in synthetic organic chemistry as they provide avenues for synthesizing
a variety of natural products.1 Among many
sulfur-containing molecules, 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol
is a fascinating molecule, which provides a site for sulfenylation2 or amination.3 However,
1H-tetrazole-5-thiol derivatives are well employed
for sulfenylation reaction, whereas the amination reaction is less
explored and is a challenging task.3 Selective
amination over sulfenylation of 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol
affording 1,4-disubstituted tetrazolothione derivatives is a demanding
task. Among various heterocyclic scaffolds, 1,4-disubstituted tetrazolothione
derivatives are promising pesticides and cytotoxic agents.4,5 Therefore, development of an efficient method for synthesizing 1,4-disubstituted
tetrazolothione derivatives has received considerable attention.

In 2013, Wu and co-workers reported a remarkable Markovnikov-selective
hydroamination of 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol with
styrene using trifluoroacetic acid.6 In
2014, the same group reported another efficient hydroamination of
styrenyl substrates with 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol
using a catalytic amount of Ga(OTf)3 (Scheme 1).7 Iodine-catalyzed reactions are attractive as they provide environmentally
benign protocols for organic synthesis.8 As a consequence, iodine-catalyzed reactions for the formation of
C–S bonds and heteroatom–heteroatom bonds have gained
a great momentum.2,9 The oxidation of 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol to disulfides by iodine is a well-known reaction,
and the corresponding disulfides have been extensively employed for
the sulfenylation reaction with carbonyl compounds, imidazoheterocycles,
enaminones, and pyrazolones.2

Scheme 1 Approaches
for Sulfenylation and Amination Reactions
Despite the significant progress in C–S-bond-forming
reactions
of 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol using iodine,2 the chemoselective C–N-bond-forming reaction is
in its infancy as 1H-tetrazole-5-thiols are highly
prone to oxidation to form their corresponding disulfides in the presence
of iodine.10 The sulfenylation of styrenes
with thiols in the presence of iodine favors the formation of β-hydroxyl
sulfides as thiols are readily oxidized by iodine to form an S–I
intermediate.11 Similarly, the hydroamination
of styrenes in the presence of iodine is a challenging task as aminoiodination
of styrene is facile under these conditions.12 In addition to the reactivity and compatibility, the most important
aspect of the addition reaction of 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol
to styrene derivatives is chemoselectivity. As our group is engaged
in developing novel routes for building C–O, C–C, and
C–S bonds under metal-free conditions,2,13 we
became interested in designing a new synthetic strategy for an iodine-catalyzed
hydroamination of styrene with 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol.
Therefore, we investigated iodine-catalyzed and metal-free reactions
employing 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol as a suitable N-nucleophile and describe the mild, user-friendly chemoselective
hydroamination of activated olefins.

Results and Discussion
On the basis of our recent work on using 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol derivatives
as a coupling partner for sulfenylation reactions,2 we envisioned that 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol
might be employed to obtain iodothiolation of styrenyl derivatives.
We started our investigations using 1-methyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol
(1a) and styrene (2a) as model substrates
in the presence of 20 mol % iodine as a Lewis acid and dichloroethane
(DCE) as solvent at 25 °C. In this reaction, the corresponding
sulfenylated product 3a′ was obtained in 21% isolated
yield (entry 1, Table 1). Increasing the temperature to 40 and 60 °C led to a significant
increase in the yield of the hydroaminated product along with sulfenylated
products (entries 2 and 3). However, performing the reaction at 80
°C furnished the corresponding hydroaminated product 3a, exclusively, in 96% yield (entry 4). These reactions (entries 2–4)
indicate the formation of the stable thermodynamic control product 3a. Screening of solvent revealed that 1,2-dichloroethane
would be an optimal solvent, as the reaction afforded the product 3a in 96% yield with excellent chemoselectivity (entry 4, Table 1). However, the reactions
in solvents such as acetonitrile, toluene, and dioxane also furnished
the product 3a in 73, 90, and 76% yields, respectively
(entries 5–7, Table 1), whereas other solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF)
and dimethylacetamide were not suitable under the reaction conditions
(entries 7–9, Table 1). Further varying the equivalence of 1a, 2a, or iodine was not helpful (entries 10–14, Table 1). The same reaction
did not furnish 3a in the absence of iodine under the
optimal reaction conditions (entry 15, Table 1). With these screening studies, further
investigation was carried out using 1a (1 equiv), 2a (1.2 equiv), and iodine (20 mol %) in solvent 1,2-dichloroethane
(1 mL) at 80 °C.

After establishing the optimal reaction conditions, the scope of
the reaction was explored using a variety of styrene derivatives (Scheme 2). A remarkably high
selectivity was obtained with styrenes, α-substituted styrene
derivatives, and vinyl ethers. From the reaction, it was found that
styrene derivatives are most reactive, α-substituted styrene
derivatives are moderately reactive, and vinyl ethers are poorly reactive
under the reaction condition.

To probe the versatility of this catalytic system, the
scope and
limitation of the reaction have been evaluated using a variety of
styrene derivatives with alkyl substitution resided at different positions
on the phenyl ring. Alkyl groups, such as methyl or tert-butyl groups, present at different positions on the phenyl ring
of styrene derivatives afforded the corresponding products in excellent
yields (3b–f, Scheme 2). Further, the structures of these compounds
were confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure of compound 3e (Figure 1).

Figure 1 X-ray crystal
structure of compound 3e.

Substrate scope was explored with aryl-substituted styrene,
such
as 4-vinyl-1,1′-biphenyl, which was found to be the most reactive
substrate furnishing the product 3g in 94% yield (Scheme 2). Encouraged by
these results, substrate scope was examined with various halogenated
substrates, which are useful precursors for a variety of metal-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions.14 Thus, fluoro-,
chloro-, and bromo-substituted styrene derivatives were well tolerated
affording the corresponding hydroamination products 3h–j in 86, 91, and 81% yields, respectively. The
reaction of 1-methyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol (1a) with 2-vinylnaphthalene and (E)-buta-1,3-dien-1-ylbenzene
was facile, furnishing the corresponding aminated products 3k and 3l in 78 and 67% yields, respectively (Scheme 2). The reaction of
4-vinylphenyl acetate, a styrene derivative, with an electron-donating
group on phenyl ring proceeded smoothly, furnishing the product 3m in 87% yield. Similar reactions with methoxy- and anilide-substituted
derivatives were found to furnish the products 3n and 3o in moderate yields, respectively (Scheme 2). 4-Vinylaniline failed to furnish the desired
product 3p under the reaction conditions. Heterocyclic-substituted
derivatives, such as 2-vinylthiophene, afforded the aminated product 3q in moderate yield (69%). The scope of the reaction was
extended by reacting styrene derivatives that contain electron-withdrawing
substituents such as nitrile and nitro groups. 4-Vinylbenzonitrile failed to
undergo the reaction, as initially it was intact under the reaction
conditions, whereas 1-nitro-3-vinylbenzene surprisingly afforded the
sulfenylated product 3s′ in poor yield (28%, Scheme 2).

We then
examined the reaction of dihydronaphthalene, which underwent
a chemoselective reaction affording the corresponding aminated product 3t in good yield (73%).

The reaction of prop-1-en-2-ylbenzene,
a styrene derivative that
has methyl substitution at α-position of styrene, furnished
the corresponding aminated product 3u in moderate yield
(51%).

The scope of the reaction was further explored with vinyl
ether
derivatives, such as 5-methylfuran-2(3H)-one and
3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran. 5-Methylfuran-2(3H)-one delivered the desired product 3v in moderate yield
(56%), whereas 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran afforded the
product 3w in poor yield (20%). Even though the yields
of the reactions were low, the high chemoselectivity obtained in these
reactions to obtain hydroaminated products over hydrothiolation products
is commendable. In these reactions, the decrease in the yields is
due to the decomposition of the starting material thiol 1a. Upon changing from 1-methyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol
to 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol, no significant
change in the reactivity was observed. Thus, 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol successfully coupled with various styrene derivatives
to form the corresponding hydroaminated products 4a–e in excellent yields (88, 92, 94, 89, and 78%, respectively; Scheme 2).

To get an
insight into the reaction mechanism, a few control experiments
were performed (Scheme 3). The reaction of 1a and 2a under the
optimal conditions in the presence of 2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
furnished a trace amount of product 3a, whereas the same
reaction in the presence of a radical inhibitor butylated hydroxyl
toluene proceeded well to form 3a in 91% yield, indicating that
the reaction does not proceed through a radical pathway (Scheme 3a). The reaction
of thiols with iodine is known to furnish the corresponding disulfides.10 Therefore, a reaction was performed with disulfide,
1,2-bis(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)disulfane, in the
presence of iodine, in which the formation of the product 3a was not observed (Scheme 3b). The reaction of hydrothiolated product 3a′ under the optimal reaction conditions with iodine or HI failed to
afford the corresponding hydroaminated product 3a (Scheme 3c). Similarly, the
reactions of styrene 2a or thiol 1a with
iodine, under the optimal reaction conditions, and the decomposition
of the starting materials were observed (Scheme 3d). The reactions proceeded well with a catalytic
amount of aqueous HI to form product 3a in 78% (Scheme 3e). Saito and Minakata
independently reported a molecular iodine-catalyzed reaction involving
HI and deiodination of the heteroatom.15 To find whether the present reaction also follows similar pathways,
we performed reactions of 1a with (1-iodoethyl)benzene
with iodine or HI and without iodine. However, these reactions furnished
a mixture of 3a and 3a′ (3a as the major product and 3a′ as the minor product; Scheme 3f). As we obtain
the hydroamination product exclusively, we believe that the reaction
that we have developed proceeds through Lewis acid catalysis.

Scheme 3 Control Experiments
On the basis of literature reports7,16 and
our observations,
a plausible mechanism has been proposed (Scheme 4). Iodine acts as a Lewis acid to activate
styrene to form carbocation (II). Further, N-atom of
1H-tetrazole-5-thiol acts as nucleophile to form
electrophilic species (III). Intermediate (III) reacts further with styrene to form the desired product benzyl
carbocation, and the cycles continues.

Scheme 4 Tentative Mechanism
Conclusions
In
summary, chemoselective hydroamination of styrene derivatives
with 1-methyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol and 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol has been described under metal-free
reaction conditions using iodine in a catalytic amount. Interestingly,
the reaction does not lead to either hydroxy thiolation or iodoamination
of styrene derivatives. A high selectivity obtained for the hydroamination
over sulfenylation is remarkable as 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol
is prone to oxidation by iodine to its disulfide. The salient feature
of the reaction is that the reaction proceeds well in the absence
of any metal catalyst, and the following reaction may be highly practical
as it employs inexpensive, nontoxic, and eco-friendly iodine system
and may find a good utility in organic chemistry.

Experimental
Section
General Experimental Procedure
Deuterated solvents
CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 were used
as solvents for recording NMR spectra on a 400 MHz spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane
for 1H NMR in CDCl3 and residual nondeuterated
solvent peak (DMSO, δ = 2.50 ppm) in DMSO-d6 served as internal standards. The solvent signals δ
77.00 for CDCl3 and δ 39.5 for DMSO-d6 were used as internal standards for 13C NMR
experiments. IR spectra were recorded using an FT-IR spectrometer.
A Q-TOF mass spectrometer (HRMS) was used for obtaining mass spectral
data. Flash column chromatography was carried out by packing glass
columns with commercial silica gel 230–400 mesh (commercial
suppliers). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out using
silica gel GF-254. All catalysts, reagents, and reactants were procured
from commercial suppliers. Dichloroethane was distilled over calcium
hydride, stored over molecular sieves, and used for all procedures.
Other solvents used for work up and chromatographic procedures were
purchased from commercial suppliers.

Typical Experimental Procedure
for the Hydroamination of Styrene
Derivatives
Iodine (20 mol %) was added to a well-stirred
solution of 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol (0.86 mmol, 1 equiv)
and styrene (1.03 mmol, 1.2 equiv) in dichloroethane (1 mL). The reaction
mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 12–16 h. After completion
of the reaction (monitored by TLC), water (25 mL), and dilute sodium
thiosulfate solution (5 mL) were added and extracted with ethyl acetate
(3 × 20 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The
crude product was purified on a silica gel column using hexane/EtOAc
to get the pure product.

Caution: Addition of iodine
to thiols was highly exothermic and decomposition of 1H-tetrazole-5-thiol was observed. Iodine should be added to a well-stirred
solution of thiol and styrene in solvent.
