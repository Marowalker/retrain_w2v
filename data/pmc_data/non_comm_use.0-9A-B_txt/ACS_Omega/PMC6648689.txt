Horseradish
peroxidase isoenzyme C (HRP) and Engyodontium album proteinase K (proK) were immobilized inside macro- and mesoporous
silica monoliths. Stable immobilization was achieved through simple
noncovalent adsorption of conjugates, which were prepared from a polycationic,
water-soluble second generation dendronized polymer (denpol) and the
enzymes. Conjugates prepared from three denpols with the same type
of repeating unit (r.u.), but different average lengths were compared.
It was shown that there is no obvious advantage of using denpols with
very long chains. Excellent results were achieved with denpols having
on average 750 or 1000 r.u. The enzyme-loaded monoliths were tested
as flow reactors. Comparison was made with microscopy glass coverslips
onto which the conjugates were immobilized and with glass micropipettes
containing adsorbed conjugates. High enzyme loading was achieved using
the monoliths. Monoliths containing immobilized denpol–HRP
conjugates exhibited good operational stability at 25 °C (for
at least several hours), and good storage stability at 4 °C (at
least for weeks) was demonstrated. Such HRP-containing monoliths were
applied as continuous flow reactors for the quantitative determination
of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution between 1 μM (34 ng/mL)
and 50 μM (1.7 μg/mL). Although many methods for immobilizing
enzymes on silica surfaces exist, there are only a few approaches
with porous silica materials for the development of flow reactors.
The work presented is a promising contribution to this field of research
toward bioanalytical and biosynthetic applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Among
the various methodologies which have been developed during the last
decades for the immobilization of enzymes on silica surfaces,1−26 one recently developed method is based on the preparation of dendronized
polymer (denpol)–enzyme conjugates.27−30 The principle of the method is
simple. In a first step, enzyme molecules are attached to a dissolved,
water-soluble denpol of second generation (abbreviated as de-PG2), which carries in each repeating unit (r.u.) four
amino groups; that is, for a de-PG2n molecule consisting of n = 1000 r.u., as
many as 4000 amino groups are distributed along the denpol chain.
The attachment of the desired enzyme molecules to de-PG2 occurs via covalent, spectrophotometrically quantifiable,31−33 bis-aryl hydrazone (BAH) bonds (Figure 1). In a second step, an aqueous solution
of the denpol–BAH–enzyme conjugate is brought in contact
with a silica surface. This results in a stable, noncovalent adsorption
(immobilization) of the conjugate on this very surface. This is achieved
through many (individually weak, possibly mainly electrostatic) interactions
between the conjugate and the many hydroxyl groups of the surface.
In this way, Engyodontium album proteinase
K (proK) was previously immobilized successfully as a de-PG22000-BAH-proK conjugate on microscopy glass coverslips,
inside glass micropipettes, or on a microfluidic chip.29 Similarly, Aspergillus sp. glucose oxidase and horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) peroxidase isoenzyme C (HRP) could be immobilized on microscopy
glass coverslips,27 inside glass micropipettes,27 and onto mesoporous silica
nanoparticles.28 In the most recent work,
a microbial transglutaminase (MTG, recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli with a gene derived from Streptomyces mobaraensis) was immobilized as de-PG2500-BAH-MTG conjugate on 75 μm-sized
glass beads,34 and bovine erythrocytes
carbonic anhydrase was successfully immobilized on glass coverslips,
inside glass micropipettes, and in porous glass fiber filters.30

Figure 1 Illustration of a short section of a de-PG2n-BAH-HRP conjugate. Two denpol r.u.
are shown, whereby to one of them one HRP molecule is attached via
a spectrophotometrically quantifiable, stable BAH linker unit (in
red), most likely through Lys232 of HRP.47 PDB 1HCH.
The glycosydic chains present on the surface of HRP are not shown.

In the work presented here, we
investigated whether the same type of denpol–BAH–enzyme
conjugates can also be immobilized inside silica monoliths which have
a hierarchical pore structure consisting of a macroporous silica network,
which itself contains smaller macropores as well as mesopores (see
below and Figure 2).
Because this immobilization turned out to be possible, we evaluated
the feasibility of de-PG2n-BAH-enzyme-loaded silica monoliths for their use as flow reactor
systems. Moreover, we made a direct comparison of the immobilization
inside the monoliths with the immobilization of the same conjugates
on silica glass coverslips and inside silica micropipettes. Furthermore,
we investigated the denpol chain length dependency of the amount and
stability of the immobilized enzymes. The enzymes used in the present
investigations were HRP and proK.

Figure 2 SEM images of the silica monolith MH1
showing the presence of two types of macropores, accessible ones which
go through the entire structure (diameter: 20–30 μm)
and isolated ones within the silica skeleton (diameter: a few μm).
Accessible mesopores (diameters of ∼22 and ∼2.5 nm),
which are also present, cannot be seen at the resolution of the micrographs
shown.37 The bottom figure is reprinted
from Szymańska et al. (2016)37 with
permission from Elsevier.

The macro- and mesoporous silica monoliths used throughout
the work were of the so-called type MH1, prepared according to a modified
“Nakanishi process”35,36 and characterized
as described previously.37 The key feature
of the 4 mm thick MH1 monolith is its uniform bicontinuous, foam-like
structure with pore sizes of 20–30 μm, which results
in a very low hindrance to liquid flow when used in a flow-through
system. A second type of pores with sizes of a few μm exists
within the silica skeleton. These pores are inaccessible, that is,
isolated from the much larger pores, as clearly seen in the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 2). Because pores with diameters larger than
50 nm are classified as “macropores”,38 MH1 is a macroporous silica. Moreover, because the silica
skeleton of MH1 itself also has two types of much smaller pores with
average diameters of about 2.5 and 22 nm,37 classified as “mesopores” (2–50 nm),38 MH1 is called a “macro- and mesoporous
silica”. The accessibility of the mesopores (which are not
seen in Figure 2 due
to the limited resolution of the SEM analysis) was determined previously
by nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K and by Hg porosimetry
measurements.37 The experimentally determined
total volume of all pores of MH1 is about 4 cm3/g, of which
about 1 cm3/g is the total volume of the mesopores, and
the remaining 3 cm3/g is the calculated volume of the accessible
macropores.37 From this latter value and
assuming spherical macropores with an average diameter of 25 μm,
the total surface area limiting the accessible macropores is estimated
to be 0.72 m2/g (corresponding to 0.25% of the total surface
area, 287 m2/g,37 of all pores
in the monolith), see Supporting Information, part 1. This is the available surface area of the monolith onto
which the denpol–enzyme conjugate may adsorb. This adsorption
was tested by preparing and testing different de-PG2n-BAH-HRP and de-PG2n-BAH-proK conjugates.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Enzymes, Chemicals, and General Methods
Horseradish (A. rusticana) peroxidase
isoenzyme C (HRP, EC 1.11.1.7, M ≈ 44 000
g/mol, ε403 = 102 000 M–1 cm–1)39,40 was purchased from
Toyobo Enzymes, Japan [catalogue number PEO-131, grade I, lot 0240160000,
RZ (A403/A260 = 3.09)]. E. album proteinase K (proK,
EC 3.4.21.64, recombinant from Pichia pastoris, M = 28 900 g/mol, ε280 = 41 000 M–1 cm–1)41 was from Roche Applied Sciences, Switzerland
(catalogue number 03115879001, lot 14321500 and lot 1016630). N-Succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (S-HyNic)
and N-succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate (S-4FB) were
synthesized as described before.42 For
the commercial sources of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (used for the quantification
of HyNic in the HyNic-modified denpols), 2-hydrazinopyridine dihydrochloride
(used for the quantification of 4FB in the 4FB-modified enzymes),
2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium
salt (ABTS2–(NH4+)2, used as substrate of HRP), and succinyl-l-alanyl-l-alanyl-l-prolyl-l-phenylalanyl-para-nitroanilide (Suc-AAPF-pNA, used as substrate of proK), see Küchler
et al. (2015)27 and (2017).43 The buffer salts sodium phosphate monobasic
(anhydrous, NaH2PO4) and sodium phosphate dibasic
(anhydrous, Na2HPO4) were from Sigma-Aldrich,
Switzerland; 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid
monohydrate (MES) and 3-(N-morpholine)propanesulfonic
acid (MOPS) were purchased from AppliChem, Germany. For all experiments,
ultrapure water (filtered with a Synergy water preparation apparatus
from Millipore) was used; all solutions were stored at 4 °C.

The following buffer solutions were prepared. PB0, 0.01 M phosphate, pH = 7.0; PB0b, 0.01 M phosphate,
0.15 M NaCl, pH = 7.0 (see Section 2.9); PB1, 0.1 M phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl,
pH = 7.2; MesB1, 0.1 M MES, 0.15 M NaCl, pH = 4.7; MesB2, 0.1 M MES, pH = 5.0; MopsB1: 0.01
M MOPS, pH = 8.0; MopsB2: 0.01 M MOPS, pH = 7.0.

Because the deprotected dendronized polymer strongly adheres to glass
surfaces, all reactions, purification steps by ultrafiltration and
quantification reactions were carried out in polypropylene (PP) reaction
vessels (Eppendorf tubes from Greiner Bio-One or Sarstedt).43,44N,N-dimethylformamide (extra dry
over molecular sieve) was obtained from Acros Organics (Switzerland).

Amicon ultrafiltration devices (Ultra-4, Mcutoff = 10 or 100 kDa) were obtained from Merck Millipore
or from Sigma-Aldrich. Centrisart I ultrafiltration units (Mcutoff = 300 kDa) were from Sartorius (Switzerland).

UV/vis-spectroscopy was carried out either on a V-670 UV/Vis/NIR
spectrophotometer (from JASCO Inc., Japan) equipped with a Peltier-temperature
control (EC-717), on a SPECORD S600 diode array spectrophotometer
(from Analytik Jena), on a Cary 1E spectrophotometer (from Varian,
Australia), or on a Nano-Drop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (from Witec
AG, Switzerland).

Round microscopy glass coverslips (diameter
8 mm, thickness 0.16–0.19 mm) were obtained from Science Services
(Germany), glass micropipettes (intraMARK, 200 μL) were from
Brand (Germany), and borosilicate DURAN NMR tubes economic 178 ×
4.95 mm (cat. no. 23 170 0117) were from the Duran group (now DWK
Life Sciences).

2.2 Silica Monolith
Cylindrical monoliths of type MH1 with a diameter of 4 mm (Figure 2) were prepared from
tetraethyl orthosilicate, polyethylene glycol 35 000, water,
nitric acid (HNO3), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
at a molar ratio of 1:0.52:14.25:0.26:0.027, according to the procedure
described by Szymańska et al. (2016).37 In this previous publication, the details about the characterization
of the monolith are also provided, including an SEM analysis.37

2.3 Dendronized Polymers (Denpols)
Throughout the entire work, three deprotected second generation
denpols composed of the same r.u. (Figure 1) but with different average degrees of polymerization, n, were used. They are abbreviated as de-PG2750, de-PG21000, and de-PG220000, for corresponding values of n = 750, 1000, and 20 000. The syntheses of de-PG21000 and de-PG220000 were carried out by free radical polymerization of the Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-protected first generation macromonomer
(MG1) to yield the protected first generation denpols PG11000 and PG120000. Boc-protected PG1750 was synthesized
by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization
of MG1. Polymerization was followed by deprotection with trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) and dendronization to yield the second generation Boc-protected
denpols PG2750, PG21000, and PG220000. Deprotection by TFA afforded the deprotected denpols (de-PG2750, de-PG21000, and de-PG220000) used in this study (Figure S1).43 For de-PG2n dissolved in aqueous
solution, the molar absorption coefficient at 285 nm, ε285nm, which was used for the spectrophotometric determination
of the r.u. concentration is ε285 = 5000 M–1 r.u. cm–1 (Fornera et al., 2011).44

Molar mass determinations of the Boc-protected second
generation denpols, PG2750, PG21000, and PG220000, were carried out on a Viscotek GPCmax system (from Malvern),
equipped with a Viscotek TDA detector array and a 2× D5000 column
set using DMF containing 0.1% w/v LiBr as eluent. The denpols were
dissolved in the eluent containing an additional 0.1% v/v toluene
as flow marker. The results summarized in Table 1 were evaluated by using universal calibration
employing narrow-dispersity poly(methyl methacrylate) standards (from
Polymer Laboratories).

2.4 Partial Modification of de-PG2n for Obtaining de-PG2n-HyNic
The partial
modification of de-PG2750, de-PG21000, and de-PG220000 with
S-HyNic at pH = 7.2 (PB1)—followed by purification
with MesB1(pH = 4.7)—and the quantification
of the modification with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde at pH = 5.0 (MesB2) for determining the molar substitution ratio, MSR(HyNic),
were carried out in a similar way as described before (using ε390 = 24 000 M–1 cm–1),43 see Supporting Information (Table S1). The concentration of the denpol r.u.
was determined with the trypan blue assay, see Supporting Information (Figure S2). To visualize the modified
denpols de-PG2n-HyNic,
tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied, as described
previously,27 see Figure 3.

of the bar: 200 (a,b) or 400 nm (c).

2.5 Partial Modification of HRP and proK for Obtaining
HRP-4FB and proK-4FB
The partial modification of HRP and
proK (through accessible lysine residues on the surface of the enzyme
molecules) with S-4FB in either PB1 (pH = 7.2 for
HRP) or MopsB1 (pH = 8.0 for proK)—followed
by purification in MesB1 (pH = 4.7)—and the
quantification of the modification with 2-hydrazinopyridine at pH
= 4.7 (in MesB1) for the determination of the molar
substitution ratio MSR(4FB) were carried out as described before (using
ε350 = 24 500 M–1 cm–1),29,42,43 see Supporting Information (Table S2).

2.6 Preparation of de-PG2n-BAH-HRP and de-PG2n-BAH-proK
The denpol–enzyme conjugates de-PG2n-BAH-HRP and de-PG2n-BAH-proK were prepared
by incubating at pH = 4.7 (MesB1) a solution of de-PG2n-HyNic with either a
solution of HRP-4FB, or a solution of proK-4FB, as described before,29,42,43 see Supporting Information, part 6. The concentration of BAH bonds formed
in the conjugation reaction was determined by using ε354 = 29 000 M–1 cm–1(Küchler
et al., 2017).43

The denpol–enzyme
conjugates prepared in this work are abbreviated in the same way as
in our previous work,27,29,42 whereby the average number of enzyme molecules per average chain
length, n, is indicated: de-PG2750-BAH-HRP62, de-PG21000-BAH-HRP70, de-PG220000-BAH-HRP1850, and de-PG2750-BAH-proK115.

2.7 Immobilization of de-PG2n-BAH-enzyme on Silicate
Surfaces
2.7.1 Immobilization on Microscopy Glass Coverslips
and inside Glass Micropipettes
Details about the immobilization
of the conjugates on microscopy glass coverslips [diameter: 8 mm;
thickness: 0.16–0.19 mm; total surface area (both sides): 1.0
cm2] and inside glass micropipettes (“200 μL”;
full length: 14 cm; inner diameter: 1.6 mm; inner surface area: 7.0
cm2; total inner volume: 280 μL) are given in the Supporting Information (parts 7 and 8). The procedures
used were similar to the ones described before.27,29,43

2.7.2 Immobilization in Monolith
MH1 for Use as Batch Reactors and for Flow Reactor Applications with
NMR Tubes as Monolith Holders
The cylindrical monoliths with
diameters of 4 mm were cut into pieces of about 5 mm length and then
cleaned with ethanol by inserting the monolith pieces into 1 mL ethanol,
followed by three times bath sonication with fresh ethanol for 10
min and finally drying with a stream of nitrogen gas, followed by
storage in air for 3 days. The conjugates were then immobilized in/on
the monolith pieces for two different applications, as batch reactor
systems and as flow reactors.

For the batch reactor applications, a monolith piece was put inside a 2 mL PP reaction
tube to which 1 mL MesB1 was added for wetting the
monolith. After removal of MesB1, a solution of de-PG2n–BAH–enzyme
(prepared in MesB1 at [enzyme] = 2 μM, as determined
from the BAH bond formation, see Supporting Information, part 6) was added to the tube and stored for 2 h at room temperature.
After removal of the conjugate solution, the monolith piece was washed
three times by immersing in 1 mL fresh buffer solution (PB0 in the case of HRP, MopsB2 for proK). The monolith
piece was then stored immersed in 1 mL buffer solution (PB0 in the case of HRP, MopsB2 for proK) at 4 °C
until further use.

For the flow reactor applications,
the monolith piece was inserted into a borosilicate NMR tube (outer
diameter: 4.95 ± 0.05 mm; inner diameter: 4.20 ± 0.05 mm),
which was cut to a length of ∼5 mm. The small glass tube containing
the monolith piece was then connected to PTFE tubes. After wetting
with MesB1, the procedure for the immobilization
of the conjugates was the same as described above for the glass micropipettes,
see Section 2.7.1.

2.8 Enzyme Activity Measurements
The
activity of HRP, either dissolved in aqueous solution or immobilized
on silicate surfaces, was measured at ∼25 °C with 1.0
mM ABTS2– and 0.2 mM H2O2 at
pH = 7.0 (PB0) by taking into account ε414nm (ABTS•– = 36 000 M–1 cm–1),27,45 see Supporting Information, part 9.1
and 9.2. For measuring the activity of proK, the substrate used was
Suc-AAPF-pNA (0.5 mM) at ∼25 °C, pH = 7.0 (MopsB2), using ε410nm (p-nitroaniline)
= 8800 M–1 cm–1,29,46 see Supporting Information, part 9.3
and 9.4.

2.9 Hydrogen Peroxide Quantification Experiments
with Additionally Synthesized de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71
2.9.1 Preparation of de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71
The
preparation of de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71 was carried out in a similar way as described in Sections 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6. All details
are provided in the Supporting Information, part 11.

2.9.2 Immobilization of de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71 in Monolith MH1
Placed inside LDPE Tubes for Flow Reactor Applications
A
2.5 cm long tube was cut from a disposable, sterile low-density polyethylene
(LDPE) transfer pipette (inner diameter ≈ 4 mm, from VWR Switzerland,
product number 612-4466, lot no. 120627). A 5 mm long piece of the
cylindrical monolith MH1 (d = 4 mm) was inserted into the LDPE tube
and placed in its center part, followed by flushing with nitrogen
gas to remove monolith debris. The monolith was then washed with deionized
water by pumping it through the monolith with the help of a P-1 peristaltic
pump (from Pharmacia), followed by drying with nitrogen gas. A solution
of de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71 was
prepared with 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0) containing
0.15 M NaCl (abbreviated as PB0b). The HRP concentration
in this solution was set to 0.5 μM, as determined on the basis
of activity measurements with ABTS2– (1.0 mM) and
H2O2 (0.2 mM) as substrates in PB0b and a calibration curve prepared with native HRP. A volume of 50
μL of this de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71 solution was then pipetted from one side onto the monolith
inside the LDPE tube. The entire 50 μL volume (corresponding
to the accessible pore volume, see Supporting Information, part 1) was taken up by the monolith through capillary
forces, that is, no pumping was necessary and no leakage of the solution
from the monolith was observed. After incubation for 1 h at RT, the
monolith inside the LDPE tube was washed with PB0b. After washing, the tube was filled with PB0b,
closed at both ends with Parafilm and stored at ∼4 °C
in the refrigerator until further use. For more details, see Supporting Information, part 13.

2.9.3 Flow-through Activity Measurements of de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71 Immobilized in Monolith MH1 Placed
inside LDPE Tubes
The activity measurements of the HRP-loaded
monoliths placed inside LDPE tubes were carried out with ABTS2– (1.0 mM) and H2O2 (0.2 mM)
in a similar way as described for the monoliths placed inside the
borosilicate NMR tube. The only difference was that PB0b was used instead of PB0 and that the flow rate
was 200 μL/min instead of 35 μL/min. For more details,
see Supporting Information, part 13.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Preparation
and Characterization of the Denpol–BAH–Enzyme Conjugates de-PG2n-BAH-HRP and de-PG2n-BAH-proK (n = 750, 1000, or 20 000)
During the first phase of
the investigation, four different denpol–BAH–enzyme
conjugates were synthesized from the denpol de-PG2n (Figure 1). Three batches de-PG2n with different number averaged degrees of polymerization, n, and different polydispersity indices (PDI) were prepared
and used, abbreviated as de-PG2750, de-PG21000, and de-PG220000, see Table 1 and Section 2.3. In a first
step, some of the amino groups of the three denpols were modified
with N-succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone
hydrazone (S-HyNic) and then purified by ultrafiltration, see Section 2.4. The AFM images
taken from the HyNic-modified denpols, which were deposited from aqueous
solution onto mica and then visualized in the dry state, confirm qualitatively
that one of the three batches (de-PG220000) contained rather long chains (Figure 3). In a second step, the two enzymes, HRP
and proK, were modified with N-succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate
(S-4FB) and then purified by ultrafiltration, see Section 2.5. Finally, by simple mixing
of two aqueous solutions of HyNic-modified denpol (de-PG2n-HyNic) and 4FB-modified enzymes
(HRP-4FB or proK-4FB) and subsequent purification by ultrafiltration,
the following four denpol–BAH–enzyme conjugates were
obtained, see Section 2.6: (i) de-PG2750-BAH-HRP62; (ii) de-PG21000-BAH-HRP70; (iii) de-PG220000-BAH-HRP1850; and (iv) de-PG2750-BAH-proK115. The subscript after the enzymes HRP and proK indicates the average
number of enzyme molecules per denpol chain. Based on the quantification
of the enzyme modification with 4FB [MSR(4FB) < 1.0, Table S2], the enzyme molecules were considered
to be bound to the denpol through one single BAH bond.

3.2 Activity and Stability of the Denpol–BAH–Enzyme
Conjugates in Aqueous Solution
After preparation of the denpol–BAH–enzyme
conjugates, their activities were tested. In the case of HRP, the
substrates used were ABTS2– (1.0 mM) and H2O2 (0.2 mM), measured at pH = 7.0 (PB0) and 25 °C. For proK, the substrate was Suc-AAPF-pNA (0.5 mM),
also measured at pH = 7.0 (MopsB2) and 25 °C.

The stability of pH = 7.0 solutions of denpol-bound HRP stored
up to 30 days at 4 °C is the same as the stability of solutions
of free HRP and of HRP-4FB at the same HRP concentration of 2 μM;
in all cases, the HRP remained highly stable, see Figure 4. In the case of pH = 7.0 solutions
of proK, again stored at 4 °C, there was a significant loss in
enzyme activity for all samples, independent of whether proK was bound
to de-PG2750 or whether it was free in
solution, unmodified (proK) or 4FB-modified (proK-4FB); the drop in
activity during 30 days storage was about 45% (Figure 5), in agreement with our previous findings
for de-PG22000-BAH-proK140.29

Figure 4 Stability of native HRP, HRP-4FB, and de-PG2750/1000/20000-BAH-HRP stored at 4 °C, pH = 7.0
(PB0). The HRP and HRP-4FB solutions were stored
at a concentration of 2 μM. The concentration of the de-PG2750/1000/20000-BAH-HRP solution corresponded
to 2 μM HRP, as determined from the change of the UV/vis absorption
caused by the formation of the BAH bond during the conjugation reaction.
The enzymatic activity measurements were performed in quartz cuvettes
(l = 1.0 cm) at pH = 7.0 (PB0) using a 100×
diluted storage solution, 1.0 mM ABTS2- and 0.2
mM H2O2 as substrate.

a concentration of 1 μM. The concentration of proK in the conjugate
solutions was 10 μM, as determined from the BAH concentration.

3.3 Activity
and Stability of Denpol–BAH–Enzyme Conjugates Immobilized
on Microscopy Glass Coverslips
The prepared denpol–BAH–enzyme
conjugates were immobilized on round-shaped microscopy glass coverslips
(see Section 2.7.1) and the activity of the immobilized enzymes was measured. Before
that, the possible release of the immobilized enzymes from the glass
surface into the buffer solution in which the coverslips were stored
was analyzed by determining the enzyme activity in the buffer solution
after repetitive washing cycles. In all cases, no significant amounts
of released enzyme could be detected (Figure S3). This indicates that there was either (i) no significant enzyme
release from the glass surface under the conditions used, (ii) the
released enzymes were inactivated, or (iii) there was no enzyme immobilized
at all which could be released. This latter possibility was not the
case, as was demonstrated with experiments in which the activity of
the immobilized enzymes was measured by first replacing the pH = 7.0
storage buffer solution with a substrate solution, followed by incubation
for 2 min at room temperature (see Section 2.8). Afterward, the amount of product formed
was quantified spectrophotometrically, and the measurements were repeated
after washing the coverslips carrying the immobilized enzymes again
with storage buffer (pH = 7.0), see Figure 6. For all denpol–BAH–enzyme
conjugates investigated, immobilization was successful and the activity
of the immobilized enzymes remained stable for several washing cycles.

Figure 6 Stability
of HRP (a) and proK (b) immobilized on glass coverslips. After enzyme
immobilization (in MesB1) and subsequent washing
with buffer solution (PB0 for HRP and MopsB2 for proK), the glass coverslips carrying the immobilized enzymes
were analyzed at 25 °C for enzymatic activity by inserting the
coverslips into a substrate solution (1.0 mM ABTS2–, 0.2 mM H2O2 for HRP, pH = 7.0, PB0; 0.5 mM Suc-AAPF-pNA for proK, pH = 7.0, MopsB2) for 2 min. Product formation was monitored at either 414 nm (a)
(for HRP, ABTS•–) or 410 nm (b) (for proK, p-nitroaniline). After removal of the substrate solution
and washing with PB0 or MopsB2,
the activities were measured again. The procedure was repeated another
eight (for HRP) or six times (for proK). Control measurements with
coverslips which were treated with free HRP or proK instead of the
conjugates are also shown.

In the case of the denpol–BAH–HRP conjugates,
the lowest activity was observed for the conjugate prepared from the
longest denpol (de-PG220000-BAH-HRP1850), see Figure 6a. Therefore, using very long denpol chains (20 000
r.u.) did not lead to the immobilization of a higher HRP activity,
when compared to the conjugates prepared and purified in the same
way as the conjugates prepared from de-PG2750 and de-PG21000 and immobilized in the
same way.

For all three conjugates used (including those prepared
with de-PG21000 and de-PG2750), the activity of the coverslips carrying the
conjugates remained stable, without any significant HRP leakage from
the coverslip surface (Figure S3a). No
immobilization occurred with solutions of free HRP or with free HRP-4FB.

For the de-PG2750-BAH-proK conjugate
analyzed, it is clear that it stably adsorbed on the glass coverslip,
while the amount of immobilized free proK or prok-4FB was very low,
see Figure 6b. No significant
proK release from the coverslip surface could be detected during the
applied washing steps, see Figure S3b.

In summary, all experiments showed that all tested de-PG2n-BAH-HRP and de-PG2n-BAH-proK conjugates can be immobilized
on glass coverslips. Very long denpol chains are not required for
a stable immobilization and apparently are not beneficial for achieving
high immobilization yields. Denpols with about 1000 r.u. are sufficient.
These data can be compared with the results obtained previously with de-PG22000-BAH-proK140 (Küchler
et al., 2015)29 and with de-PG21400-BAH-HRP108 (Küchler et al.,
2015).27 They are consistent with each
other and confirm the good reproducibility of the denpol-based immobilization
method.

3.4 Activity and Stability of Denpol–BAH–Enzyme
Conjugates Immobilized inside Glass Micropipettes
After confirming
the stable adsorption of the prepared denpol–BAH–enzyme
conjugates on microscopy glass coverslips for enzymatic reactions
in bulk solutions in which the coverslips were immersed (see Section 3.3), we investigated
the immobilization of the same conjugates inside glass micropipettes
with an inner diameter of 1.6 mm and a total volume of 280 μL
for use under continuous flow conditions (see Section 2.7.1). The chosen standard
conditions we used for the immobilization of the enzymes through simple
adsorption of the conjugates for 2 h at RT were 2.0 μM enzyme
in MesB1 (pH = 4.7), see Section 2.7.1. After washing with buffer solution
(PB0 in the case of HRP, MopsB2 for
proK), substrate solutions were pumped through the micropipettes and
the conversion of the substrates into products was followed by recording
the absorption spectrum of the outflow from the micropipette at intervals
of 10 min for 6 h, see Figure 7. All micropipettes which were treated with the conjugates
showed enzyme activity, in qualitative agreement with our previous
investigations of de-PG21400-BAH-HRP108 (Küchler et al., 2015)27 and de-PG22000-BAG-proK140 (Küchler et al., 2015),29 while
those micropipettes which were treated with free enzyme (HRP or proK)
or free 4FB-modified enzymes (HRP-4FB or proK-4FB) did not lead to
a measureable substrate conversion, as there was no stable adsorption/immobilization
of the free enzymes. This latter finding is in agreement with the
experiments using the glass coverslips (see Section 3.3). Concerning the data for the denpol–BAH–HRP
conjugates, the highest activity (for the same conjugate preparation,
purification, and immobilization protocols) was achieved with de-PG2750-BAH-HRP62, followed by de-PG21000-BAH-HRP70, and finally de-PG220000-BAH-HRP1850 (Figure 7a).

Figure 7 Use of “200 μL”
glass micropipettes containing immobilized de-PG2n-BAH-HRP (a) or de-PG2n-BAH-proK (b) as flow-through reactors. Immobilization
was performed at 2.0 μM enzyme concentrations in MesB1 for 2 h at room temperature, see Section 2.7.1. For (a), the substrates were ABTS2– (1.0 mM) and H2O2 (0.2 mM),
pH = 7.0 (PB0); for (b), the substrate was Suc-AAPF-pNA
(0.5 mM), pH = 7.0 (MopsB2). The flow rate was set
to 35 μL/min, and the outflow was analyzed spectrophotometrically.
Readings of A414 (a) and A410 (b) are plotted. They indicate formation of ABTS•– (a) and p-nitroaniline (b),
respectively. For (a), the concentration of ABTS•– in the outflow was very high, such that the A414 values were no more within the linearity range of the spectrophotometer
(JASCO V-670) for the used 1.0 cm path length. Therefore, the outflow
solution was diluted 10 times with PB0 and then A414 was determined with a 1.0 cm cuvette. The
values given in the figure are the calculated values for undiluted
solutions in a 0.1 cm cuvette.

In summary, stable immobilization of de-PG2n-BAH-HRP and de-PG2n-BAH-proK conjugates in glass micropipettes
is possible with denpols consisting of about 750, 1000, or 20 000
r.u. For the HRP conjugates, the use of de-PG220000 for the conjugate preparation resulted in lower immobilized
enzyme activity, as compared to the conjugates prepared from de-PG2750 or de-PG21000, in qualitative agreement with the results of the coverslips (Figure 6a). The reason for
this denpol chain length difference is not clear. It may be that for
the longer denpol–enzyme conjugates, more unoccupied areas
within the micropipettes remained because they could not be covered
with long chains completely.

3.5 Activity and Stability
of Denpol–BAH–Enzyme Conjugates in Silica Monoliths
In a first series of experiments, the possible immobilization of
the denpol–BAH–enzyme conjugates inside MH1 monoliths
was investigated for two different applications: as batch
reactor and as flow reactor (see Section 2.7.2). The two
systems are illustrated in Figure 8. For “loading” the cylindrical monoliths
with enzyme, a 5 mm long piece (diameter: 4 mm) of cleaned monolith
was first placed inside a 2 mL PP reaction tube to which a denpol–BAH–enzyme
solution (in MesB1, 2 μM enzyme) was added
(batch reactor). In the case of the flow reactor using the borosilicate
NMR tube as a monolith holder, the same conjugate solution was added
to the monolith after it was placed inside the tube (cut to the same
length as the monolith). For both systems, the solution containing
non-adsorbed conjugate was removed after 2 h at RT by washing with PB0 (see Section 2.7.2).

Figure 8 Schematic drawings of the use of MH1 monoliths as batch
reactor (a) and as flow reactor with either a borosilicate NMR tube
or an LDPE tube as monolith holder (b).

For the batch system (Figure 8a), the enzymatic activity and stability
of the immobilized enzymes were determined by using different de-PG2-BAH-HRP conjugates and ABTS2– (1.0
mM) and H2O2 (0.2 mM) as substrate solution
into which the enzyme-loaded monoliths were immersed. After 1 min
incubation at RT, the formation of reaction product (ABTS•–) was analyzed spectrophotometrically, whereby the formed product
mainly stayed inside the monolith (dark green color) and had to be
forced out by accelerating its release into the outer solution by
gentle shaking of the reaction tube. As shown in Figure 9, for all conjugates (including
the one prepared from de-PG220000), enzyme
activity in the batch reactor could be detected.
The monoliths containing immobilized HRP were used repeatedly with
intermittent washing steps with buffer solution (PB0). Moreover, also in the case of the monolith loading with free HRP
and with free 4FB-modified HRP (HRP-4FB), enzymatic activity was clearly
observed. This indicates that both, the free enzymes and denpol-bound
enzymes, adsorbed on and/or inside the monolith, and that in the case
of free enzymes the washing steps applied did not result in a (complete)
release of the enzymes from the monolith. This is in clear contrast
to the case of the coverslips and the micropipettes, see above. We
conclude that the porous monolith structure retains free enzymes,
at least to some extent.

Figure 9 Activity of HRP immobilized in MH1 monoliths
(MesB1) at 25 °C, analyzed with ABTS2– (1.0 mM) and H2O2 (0.2 mM) in a batch
reactor system at pH = 7.0 (PB0), see Section 2.8. The formation
of ABTS•– after 1 min is expressed as A414, measured after shaking the reaction tube
to release the formed products from the monoliths.

In a next step, monoliths loaded with enzymes—HRP
or proK—were analyzed as flow reactors. Both
ends of the tubes were connected to PTFE tubing with short pieces
of silicone tubing. After short prewashing, substrate solutions were
then pumped through the monolith-filled tubes and the solutions eluting
from the tubes were analyzed spectrophotometrically for product formation
(Figure 10). All monoliths
into which the conjugates had been immobilized showed stable product
outflow values during an operation time of 700 min. If solutions of
free HRP or free HRP-4FB were used, the outflow values for the formed
product (ABTS•–) initially were relatively
high, but started to drop to very low values (Figure 10a). This shows that free enzymes are not
very stably retained. In the case of proK, the monoliths which were
loaded with free enzymes showed low outflows of product (p-nitroaniline) throughout the entire operation time (Figure 10b).

Figure 10 Activity of HRP (a)
and proK (b) immobilized in MH1 monolith flow reactors (placed inside
small pieces of an NMR tube, see Section 2.7.2 and Figure 8) at 25 °C. For (a), a pH = 7.0 solution
containing 1.0 mM ABTS2– and 0.2 mM H2O2 was pumped through the enzyme-containing monolith (PB0). For (b), the pH = 7.0 solution contained Suc-AAPF-pNA
at 0.5 mM (MopsB2). In both cases, the flow rate
was 35 μL/min. The outflow from the monolith was analyzed spectrophotometrically.
Readings of A414 [(a) ABTS•–]
or A410 [(b) p-nitroaniline] are plotted.

Based on the successful immobilization of the different de-PG2n-BAH-HRP and de-PG2n-BAH-proK conjugates
in MH1 monolith flow reactors, the reproducibility
of this finding was investigated in a second phase of the work. For
this, an additional de-PG21000-BAH-HRP
conjugate was synthesized (de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71, see Section 2.9.1 and Supporting Information, part
11, Figures S4 and S5). This conjugate was then immobilized in the
monolith, whereby alternative monolith holder tubes were applied. Flow reactors were prepared by using tubes made from LDPE
instead of borosilicate (Section 2.9.2, Figures S6 and S7). Furthermore, the monoliths were incubated at pH = 7.0
(instead of 4.7) with lower amounts of conjugates (0.5 μM HRP
instead of 2 μM, as determined by activity measurements using
a calibration curve with free HRP, see Figure S8) and a shorter incubation time (1 h instead of 2 h). The
monolith was washed extensively by using a peristaltic pump so that
weakly adsorbed enzymes were washed out. Furthermore, the flow rate
was increased substantially (from 35 to 200 μL/min). With these
modifications, the immobilization was again successful. The results
confirmed the most important finding of this work. The type of denpol–enzyme
conjugates which we have investigated in the past couple of years27−29 can be immobilized stably inside MH1 monoliths for flow-through
reactor applications. When the monolith was loaded with a solution
of free HRP instead of a solution of de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71, the activity of the monolith was very low
and vanished nearly completely after repeated use and storage at 4
°C (Figure 11). However, a MH1 monolith carrying de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71 showed constant activity when repeatedly used
at room temperature after storage at 4 °C (Figure 11). Furthermore, by varying
the concentration of H2O2 in a pH = 7.0 solution
pumped through another monolith of the same type—at fixed [ABTS2–] = 1.0 mM—the monolith outflow of ABTS•– was shown to linearly depend on the H2O2 concentration in the range of [H2O2] = 1–50 μM (Figure 12). In these experiments, 1 mM ABTS2– solutions of increasing H2O2 concentrations
(“analyte solutions”) were pumped through the monolith
containing HRP conjugate. Between the measurements, buffer solution
was pumped through the monolith for a fixed time period (Figure 12a,b). With this
set-up (Figure S9), the outflow signal
(ΔA414, originating from ABTS•–) depended linearly on the H2O2 concentration between 1 and 50 μM, corresponding to
34 ng/mL H2O2 to 1.7 μg/mL H2O2 present in the analyte solution (Figure 12c). In a follow-up work, we
will apply this HRP-containing spectrophotometric flow reactor system
for the quantitative determination of hydrogen peroxide in biological
samples.

Figure 11 Activity of HRP immobilized in a MH1 monolith flow reactor (placed
inside an LDPE tube, see Section 2.9.2 and Figure 8). The monolith was loaded with de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71. After prewashing with buffer
solution (0.01 M phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH = 7.0, PB0b), a substrate solution consisting of 1.0 mM ABTS2– and 0.2 mM H2O2 (pH = 7.0, PB0b) was pumped through the monolith at 25 °C at a flow rate of
200 μL/min. A414 (l = 0.1 cm) of
the outflowing solution was measured. After a run time of 180 min,
the monolith was washed with PB0b and then stored
at 4 °C for 2 weeks. Afterward, a substrate solution of the same
composition was again passed through the monolith at room temperature,
followed by washing with PB0b and storage for another
2 weeks at 4 °C. Control measurements were carried out with a
monolith which was loaded with free HRP (red data points). The solid
lines indicate the average values to guide the eye.

Figure 12 Use of a MH1 monolith flow reactor containing immobilized
HRP for the quantification of H2O2 in aqueous
solution. The monolith was loaded with de-PG21000-BAH-HRP71 (placed inside an LDPE tube, see Section 2.9.2 and Figure 8). After prewashing
with pH = 7.0 buffer solution (PB0b), substrate solutions
consisting of 1.0 mM ABTS2– and varying amounts
of H2O2 (pH = 7.0, PB0b) were
pumped through the monolith at 25 °C. (a) Concentrations of H2O2 varied between 10 and 200 μM (flow rate:
200 μL/min for 10 min) and A414 (l
= 0.1 cm) of the outflow solution was measured. Before exchanging
the substrate solution, the monolith was washed with PB0b for 5 min. (b) Same type of measurements as described in (a), but
varying the concentration of H2O2 between 0
and 10 μM and measuring A414 (l
= 1.0 cm). (c) Correlation between H2O2 concentration
in the substrate solution and the reaction product formed (ABTS•–), as expressed by A414 (values taken from (a,b); the data from (b) are scaled for a path
length of l = 0.1 cm).

4 Conclusions
Previous investigations
have shown that the monolith MH1—a “macro- and mesoporous
silica”—has excellent properties for the covalent immobilization
of enzymes.10,16,37 We have shown that the immobilization of HRP and proK in this monolith
is easily possible with the help of the polycationic, second generation
dendronized polymer de-PG2n. The enzyme molecules are first bound covalently to de-PG2n, followed by stable
noncovalent adsorption of the obtained conjugates. Experiments about
the immobilization on flat silicate surfaces (glass coverslips and
inside glass micropipettes) with de-PG2n of three different average chain lengths showed
that the use of very long chains (about 20 000 r.u.) is of
no advantage. In fact, the immobilized enzyme activity was lower compared
to the same denpol with on average about 1000 r.u. if comparison is
made on the basis of identical amounts of enzyme used for the conjugate
preparation and subsequent immobilization (Figure 7). In other words, the enzyme immobilization
efficiency under the conditions used is lower for the conjugates prepared
with the very long denpol. This is an important finding for future
studies of the application and further examination of this denpol-based
immobilization method. Using de-PG2n with about 1000 r.u. appears to be an ideal choice. It allows
highly reproducible de-PG2n-BAH-enzyme conjugate preparation and immobilization in silica
monoliths MH1. As a preliminary proof-of-principle, the use of a de-PG2n-BAH-HRP-loaded monolith
for the quantitative determination of H2O2 was
demonstrated (Figure 12). Compared to the previously developed micropipette system,27,29,30 the monolith MH1 allows a higher
enzyme loading due to the very large internal surface area onto which
the denpol–enzyme conjugates can be adsorbed. This can easily
be seen qualitatively by comparing the product formation in the flow-though
reaction from de-PG2n-BAH-HRP-loaded micropipettes (Figure 7) and from de-PG2n-BAH-HRP-loaded monoliths (Figure 10a). For the monoliths, product formation
(expressed as A414) was always the same
or higher (for all conjugates) than for the micropipettes, despite
the substantially shorter resting time of the substrate within the
monoliths as compared to the micropipettes. One of our next attempts
is toward the development of MH1-flow reactors for enzymatic cascade
reactions.
