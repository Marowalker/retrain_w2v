The propagation of
surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) along two-dimensional
(2D) materials, such as graphene, is a complex phenomenon linking
the microscale electronic properties to macroscale optical properties.
Complex geometries increase the complexity of understanding the nature
and performance of optoelectronic devices based on surface wave propagation.
Here, we demonstrate that under a proper design of macroscopic conductivity
profile, the propagation characteristics of SPPs in 2D materials can
be made analogous to the propagation of plane waves in homogeneous
layers with minimal out-of-plane scattering. Such a direct resemblance
enables prediction, design, and calculation of SPP propagation through
advanced geometries using fundamental laws of optics. We demonstrate
that the propagation of surface waves can be manipulated in-plane
using reflection, refraction, diffraction, and also generalized refraction
laws analogous to plane waves. We present simple mathematical models
to calculate the scattered electromagnetic fields of SPP waves based
on Fresnel equations. The presented formulation could facilitate the
transfer of many existing plane wave based optical phenomenon to a
surface wave based integrated optoelectronic devices.

1 Introduction
The discovery of atomically
thin graphene layers1 followed by other
two-dimensional (2D) materials2 and heterostructures3 has given a boost to many research areas, including
optical and
optoelectronic devices.4,5 Specifically, distinctive interest
is in the ability of such materials to support propagation of surface
plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in the THz frequency regime with remarkably
high confinement factors in comparison to pre-existing metal/dielectric
interface systems at visible frequencies.6 In analogy to metamaterials, physical combinations of these materials
have been shown to demonstrate unconventional optical properties,
such as hyperbolic dispersion7,8 and extreme light–matter
interactions.9 The ability to tune the
optical properties (surface conductivity and hence the SPP resonance)
locally using chemical bonds10,11 and dynamically using
external stimuli, such as gate bias12 and
high magnetic fields,13 is an additional
valuable asset.

The above-mentioned advantages of 2D materials
have resulted in
various physical phenomena8,14,15 and efficient devices.16,17 Whereas most of the
structures are based on homogenized patterned surfaces or stacking
of layers on top of each other (bilayers and multilayers), it is also
important to understand the optical interactions of 2D materials stitched
side-by-side with identical or nonidentical optical properties. Fabrication
and electronic properties of such designs have been recently demonstrated.18

Refraction properties of SPPs, associated
with metal/dielectric
interfaces previously studied,19 have demonstrated
that a proper choice of metals and dielectrics could eliminate the
out-of-plane scattering of SPPs, restricting their propagation to
a 2D plane analogous to plane waves. However, the proper choice requires
the permittivities of two out of four metal and dielectric components
involved in the system to be uniaxial with three subcriteria to be
satisfied. The limited availability in the choice of conventional
metals and dielectrics limits the feasibility of satisfying the three
subcriteria.

In this work, we focus on predicting and designing
the nature of
SPP propagation through in-plane stitched 2D materials with homogeneous
and patterned intersections. In contrast to conventional metals or
dielectrics, 2D materials offer dynamical tunability of their optical
properties after the sample fabrication. Utilizing the flexibility
of optical properties, we demonstrate that by properly tuning the
surface conductivity of the materials in different regions, the SPP
propagation can be directly mapped to the fundamental laws of optics,
the Fresnel laws, similar to metal/dielectric systems19 to predict reflection and refraction of surface waves without
the requirement of uniaxial nature. In addition, utilizing the flexibility
of the physical design of 2D materials, we also demonstrate diffraction
and generalized refraction20 of surface
waves at engineered intersections of different media.

2 SPP Reflection and Refraction
In classical electromagnetics,
2D media (referred to as 2D-sheets
hereafter) are considered to be conducting interfaces with strictly
zero thickness and nonzero conductivity. The reflection and refraction
coefficients of plane-wave electromagnetic fields through homogeneous
2D-sheets with surface conductivity σ separating bulk materials
(with relative permittivities ε1 and ε2) can be derived as 1  where σ is the dimensionless surface
conductivity (σ(siemens)/ε0c), kx{1,2} represents
the wavevector components perpendicular to the 2D-sheet (in the yz-plane) in each layer. k0 is
the free space wavenumber 2π/λ0. TE and TM
represent transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations
defined with respect to the direction of propagation (x-axis). When σ = 0, the above equations represent standard Fresnel
equations at an interface separating semi-infinite bulk materials
with permittivities ε1 and ε2.

SPPs propagate confined to the 2D-sheet with exponentially decaying
tails into the bulk layers. The condition for SPP resonance and calculation
of its propagation characteristics are studied in ref (14). The reflection and refraction
that we discuss in detail in this article correspond to the scattering
of surface waves, encountering discontinuities and defects when propagating
in-plane (yz-plane), as shown in Figure 1.

and refracted angles with respect to the normal direction related
as kS;L sin θi = kS;L sin θr = kS;R sin θt; (θi = 30°). (a, c) Calculated real
part and magnitude of the in-plane magnetic field component with σL = σR = σ0. (b, d) Calculated
real part and magnitude of the in-plane magnetic field component with
σL = σR(εL/εR) = σ0. (e) and (f) are calculated transmission
and reflection coefficients of the SPP wave as a function of incident
angle for σL = σR(εL/εR) = σ0, respectively. Solid
lines represent eq 9.
Symbols represent the values calculated using a numerical method (mode-matching
analysis).28,29 In all cases σ0 = 0 + 0.074i (ns =
7.3 × 1016 m–2) and λ0 = 10 μm. Losses are removed from the surface conductivity
(only in this proof-of-principle results) for clarity in the reflection
and transmission values.

SPPs demonstrate interesting phenomena such as inhomogeneous
wave
fronts21and negative refraction22 when encountered with such homogeneous defects.
The behavior of SPPs at discontinuities and defects is usually unpredictable
and often requires complex three-dimensional numerical methods to
calculate the scattered electromagnetic fields. Approximate analytic
and numerical methods are developed to understand the reflection and
out-of-plane scattering of SPP waves at smoothed defects and gaps.23,24 A transformation optics based approach is also designed to minimize
the out-of-plane scattering of SPPs at local defects using anisotropic
materials.25 In realistic devices, such
out-of-plane radiation of SPPs is often unwanted. In case of metal/dielectric
SPPs, it has been shown that minimization of such parasitic effects
requires fabrication of engineered metamaterial structures inside
and on top of metal substrates.19

In the context of SPPs associated with 2D-sheets, consider a structure
as shown in Figure 1a,b, where a 2D-sheet is laterally shared between two dielectric
media (εL and εR). An SPP wave excited
from the left side of the left 2D-sheet, not necessarily along the
normal direction, encounters a homogeneous intersection with another
2D-sheet and bulk layers at the xy-plane. At the
intersection, it reflects and refracts into surface waves and also
scatters out of the plane into free space radiation, as shown in Figure 1c. The reason for
the out-of-plane scattering can be attributed to the mismatch in the
field decay profiles of the supported SPP waves on the two sides of
the interface. By balancing the surface conductivity on each side
using the ability to tune the carrier density locally, we demonstrate
here that the out-of-plane scattering can be minimized.

The
surface conductivity can be locally tuned by varying the carrier
density (ns) of the 2D-sheet using gate
bias. In the THz frequency regime, the surface conductivity of the
graphene layer can be described using the Drude model as 2  where vf represents
the Fermi velocity and τ represents the relaxation time. The
numerical values of the quantities vf =
106 m s–1 and τ = 500 fs are obtained
from an experimental work.26 It has been
noted that the quantity ns can be varied
2 orders of magnitude from 1016 to 1018 m–2,27 which can result in
1 order of magnitude variation in conductivity.

The SPP propagation
in each (left and right) half-space individually
is characterized by its in-plane wavevector component (kS;{L,R}), which can be determined by forcing the fields
to decay on the two sides of the interface. In fact, for a 2D-sheet
with surface conductivity σL (σR) in a medium with permittivity εL (εR) on the left (right) side of the interface, the in-plane
SPP resonance wavevector can be analytically expressed as 3  

The decay profile of the SPP perpendicular
to the sheet is characterized
by the perpendicular wavevector component (k⊥;{L,R}) in each half-space that can be derived using
the dispersion relation of the homogeneous layers (). An ideal
balance between the field decay
profiles of the two sides can be obtained when k⊥;L = k⊥;R, which
reduces to the condition 4  

The balancing condition requires tunability
of 2D-sheet conductivity
on either side proportional to the ratio of dielectric permittivities
of the media they are embedded in. Although monolayer graphene itself
has been well known for wide tunable conductivity via doping,12 considering the atomic scale thickness, multilayered
heterostructures can be equivalently used to obtain extreme variations.
Recent calculations demonstrate stable forms of heterostructures with
abilities to sustain higher doping levels over a broad frequency range.30 The effect of the surrounding dielectric environment
on the surface conductivity has also been investigated.31

Note that even though σL and σR are complex numbers in eq 4, the required ratio σL/σR is real because εL and εR are
real (for dielectrics). The required ratio can be easily managed by
changing the carrier density (eq 2), which varies both real and imaginary parts of surface conductivity
proportionally.

Figure 1b,d represents
the scattering directions and field amplitude, respectively, when
the condition in eq 4 is satisfied by the media on two sides. Evidently, the out-of-plane
scattering of the SPP is dramatically minimized, as shown in Figure 1d. As an added advantage
to the minimization of out-of-plane scattering, the boundary conditions
now enable a one-to-one correspondence among the incident, reflected,
and refracted SPPs similar to a plane wave incident on a homogeneous
interface.19 This one-to-one correspondence
facilitates a direct calculation of amplitudes of the reflected and
refracted surface waves using Fresnel-like equations that are derived
in detail in the next section for a more generalized system.

3 Formulation of Fresnel-Like Equations for SPP
Propagation
Consider a geometry as shown in Figure 2a, where space is divided into
four quadrants
with the left (right) half-space comprising an atomically thin conducting
sheet with conductivity σL (σR)
placed in between two quarter space layers with permittivity εL1 (εR1) below and εL2 (εR2) above. The sheets are considered to be in the yz-plane, and the two (left and right) half-spaces share an interface
along the xy-plane. The normal component of the SPP
wavevector along the x-axis now differs in each quarter
space representing the decay of the wave into the bulk layers and
can be calculated using the dispersion relation 5  where the square root is solved for a branch
cut with a positive imaginary part to satisfy the radiation condition
at infinity. The subscript m represents the quantities
in two half-spaces m = L,R, and the subscript n represents the quantities in bottom (n = 1) and top layers (n = 2) of each half-space.
As the SPP wave does not necessarily propagate along the normal to
the xy-plane (i.e., ky ≠ 0), the quantity kS;m2 further decomposes into two components kS;m2 = ky2 + kz;m2, representing the wavevector components along the y and z directions. Note that ky is independent of the layer indices since
the system is homogeneous in the y direction, kz;m is independent
of subscript n because each half-space is homogeneous
along the z direction. The electric and magnetic
fields of SPPs in each quarter space can be expressed as14 6  The factor p is equal to
−1 and +1 for n = 1 and 2, respectively. k⃗mn is the wavevector,
where k⃗mn = pkx;mnx̂ + kyŷ + kz;nẑ. Note that the
wavevector components implicitly satisfy the dispersion relation kx;mn2 + ky2 + kz;m2 = k02εmn in each quarter space. The quantity amn represents the amplitude
of the decay profile in each quarter space. Forcing the tangential
field boundary conditions at the position of the sheet in each half-space
individually, one can obtain the relation am2/am1 = 1 + σmkx;m1/εm1k0, where am1 can be arbitrarily chosen to be 1.

for formulation of Fresnel-like equations for SPP
waves. (b) Reflection and transmission coefficients of the SPP wave
at normal incidence as a function of εR1 with εL1 = 4, εL2 = εR2 = 1, and
σL = σR(εL1 + εL2)/(εR1 + εR2) = σ0, where σ0 = 0.0008 + 0.074i (ns = 7.3 × 1016 m–2) and λ0 = 10 μm. Solid lines
represent eq 9. Symbols
represent the values calculated using mode-matching analysis.28,29 (c, d) Calculated magnetic field amplitude of the cross section
for εL1 = 4, εR1 = 2.25, and εL2 = εR2 = 1 with eq 11 (c) not satisfied (σL =
σR = σ0) and (d) satisfied (σL = σR(εL1 + εL2)/(εR1 + εR2) = σ0).

Assuming the SPPs solely participate
in satisfying the boundary
conditions, the tangential boundary conditions at the interface along
the xy-plane can be formulated as 7  where from eq 6 8  n = 1 for x < 0 and n = 2 for x > 0. The
quantity A{L,R}± represents the overall amplitude of the
wave envelope propagating in the forward (+z) and
backward (−z) directions.

Solving eq 7, by multiplying
the electric field equation with the magnetic field term (vice versa)
and integrating over the xy-plane, the reflection
and transmission coefficients of SPP waves defined as rSPP = AL–/AL+ and tSPP = AR+/AL+ can be expressed as 9  where 10  Note that the above equations are similar
to the Fresnel equations of plane waves separating two bulk layers.

Firstly, the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated
for an intersection, as shown in Figure 1a, employing eq 9 are presented in Figure 1e,f. The calculations of the same quantities
performed using accurate numerical simulations (mode-matching method28,29) are also presented for comparison. The exact match between the
above formulation and numerical calculations demonstrates the validity
of the Fresnel-like formulation for SPPs.

Secondly, the formulation
can also be applied for a more generalized
case where the permittivity of the media in all four quadrants are
different. However, the SPP wavevector, kS;m, in each half-space does not have an exact analytic
form when εm1 ≠ εm2, but can be approximated in the quasistatic
limit to the first order as kS;m = ik0(εm1 + εm2)/σm. We verified that the approximation is valid in
the entire range of feasible carrier doping concentrations. The approximation
transforms the condition for minimizing the out-of-plane scattering
to 11  Figure 2b represents the calculated reflection and
transmission coefficients
of the SPP scattered from an intersection with εL1 ≠ εL2 and εR1 ≠
εR2. To validate the approximation, reflection and
transmission coefficients are calculated using eq 9 as a function of the permittivity of one
of the quadrants (εR1). The same quantities are calculated
using numerical simulations (mode-matching method28,29) for comparison. Figure 2c,d represents the field patterns when eq 11 is not satisfied and satisfied, respectively.
An out-of-plane scattering of the SPP can be clearly observed at the
intersection in the case of Figure 2c, where a 2D-sheet with identical surface conductivity
in both half-spaces (σL = σR) is
shared on different substrates ((εL1 + εL2)/σL ≠ (εR1 + εR2)/σR). A smooth coupling of the SPP with
minimum out-of-plane scattering can be observed in the case of Figure 2d, when the surface
conductivity on the right-hand side is tuned to satisfy the condition
((εL1 + εL2)/σL = (εR1 + εR2)/σR).

The exact match between the symbols (numerical calculations)
and
lines (eq 9) demonstrates
the validity of the Fresnel-like formulation for the scattering of
surface waves at most general intersections. The above can be used
to derive an optimized design of optoelectronic devices based on surface
waves.

4 Plasmonic–Photonic Crystals Using 2D-Sheets
The above-derived Fresnel-like equations can be used to design
optoelectronic devices such as SPP-based photonic crystals. Formation
of band gaps and field localization regimes in one-dimensional photonic
crystals is merely based on reflection and refraction of light at
the interfaces and the Bragg periodic condition.32 Here, we demonstrate that by following the criterion given
in eq 11, the photonic
crystal phenomenon can also be readily transferred to surface waves
on 2D-sheets. A schematic of the plasmonic–photonic crystal
is shown in Figure 3a, where a conducting 2D-sheet is placed on a dielectric grating.
The surface conductivity of the 2D-sheet is assumed to be tunable
locally in the regions of the dielectric and vacuum. Such a design
has been experimentally demonstrated as efficient optoelectronic devices
to convert electrical signals to optical signals.17 The thickness of each region is considered to be λSPP/4 and a cavity is introduced in the middle with thickness
λSPP/2. Note that λSPP is different
for different regions.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic of the plasmonic–photonic crystal
design.
(b) Amplitude of the normal component of the electric field on top
of the 2D-sheet following the criteria in eq 11, “with cavity” implies d = 2d2, “no cavity”
implies d = d2, and “vacuum”
implies ε1 = ε2 = 1. The inset represents
the same quantities when criteria in eq 11 are not satisfied. (c) The calculated SPP
transmission coefficient of plasmonic-photonic crystal representing
the frequency (ω) bandwidth of the photonic crystal with and
without a cavity, where ω0 = 2πc/λ0 represents the central frequency. Electric field
amplitude along the plasmonic–photonic crystal when the condition
in eq 11 is (d) not
satisfied and (e) satisfied for the case “with cavity”.
In all calculations, ε1 = 4, ε2 =
1, σ2 = σ0, σ1 =
(ε1 + ε2)/(2ε2)σ0, d1 = λSPP;1/4, d2 = λSPP;2/4, h = 100 nm, σ0 = 0.0008 + 0.074i (ns = 7.4 × 1016 m–2), and λ0 = 10 μm.

Accurate electric field amplitudes are calculated for the
structures
with and without a cavity, and, with and without following the criterion
in eq 11 using the commercial
finite element method (FEM) software (COMSOL Multiphysics). The red
solid line in Figure 3b represents the normal component electric field amplitude (|Ex|) demonstrating prohibition
of surface wave propagation in the case of a “no-cavity”
(periodic) system when eq 11 is satisfied. When a cavity is introduced into the structure,
the electric field is localized inside the cavity region as shown
by the green solid line. No such prohibition or localization is seen
for the corresponding structures when the criterion in eq 11 is not followed by the surface
conductivity profile, as shown in the inset. The dashed lines in Figure 3b represent the field
amplitudes calculated for similar structures using the above-derived
Fresnel-like formulation. As expected, the Fresnel-like equation overestimates
the localization intensity because it disregards the scattering at
multiple interfaces. In the case of localization of the field, note
that even though the geometry represents a one-dimensional photonic
crystal, the SPPs are localized into 2Ds by their nature. The localization
area in this example is of the order of 0.04 μm2,
where the free space wavelength is 10 μm. Figure 3c represents the calculated bandwidth of
the SPP photonic crystal. The band gap of the “no-cavity”
system is observed to be around 9 THz, and the bandwidth of the field
localization “with cavity” is around 1 THz. Figure 3d,e represents the
surface plot of the calculated electric field pattern of the structures
with a cavity when the criterion in eq 11 is not satisfied and satisfied, respectively.

5 Fresnel Diffraction of SPPs
In addition to Fresnel refraction laws, SPPs are
also observed
to obey diffraction laws similar to plane waves when the media satisfy
the criteria in eq 4 or 11. Recent advancements in the fabrication techniques
demonstrated the possibility of vertical growth of atomic thin materials
on substrates.33−35 The propagation of SPP waves can be controlled in
miraculous ways using such perpendicularly grown media when combined
with the ability to spatially control the optical properties. One
of the popular devices based on Fresnel diffraction are Fresnel zone
plates (FZPs), which are designed to focus diffracted plane waves
to a desired focal spot. We demonstrate focusing of SPP waves into
wavelength-sized diffraction-limited spots at a desired focal distance
on the surface of the 2D-sheet following the FZP design.

FZPs
are primarily designed as consecutive opaque and transparent
ring patterns to focus light at a desired focal distance f. The design is according to the condition to form constructive interference
of the diffracted beams at the focal distance. The radius of the lth ring to focus light at a distance f from the pattern is given by the formula 12  In the context of SPPs associated with 2D-sheets,
where the wave resides completely on the surface, the ring pattern
can be reduced to perpendicular blocks that block and allow the propagation
of SPPs (acting like transparent and opaque screens), as shown in Figure 4a. In contrast to
the structures in Figures 1a and 2a, the intersection is now considered
inhomogeneous along the y direction.

Figure 4 (a) Schematic of the
in-plane SPP diffraction setup using blocks.
(b) Intensity calculated along the focal line (f =
4λSPP), demonstrating the evolution of focal spot
as a function of conductivity of the block (σs),
where σ0 = 0.0008 + 0.074i (ns = 7.4 × 1016 m–2) is the
conductivity of the 2D-sheet on the two sides of the blocks. The 2D-sheet
is placed on a substrate (ε = 2.25) with vacuum on top; λ0 = 10 μm and λSPP ≈ 227 nm.
The inset shows the bandwidth of the focal spot as a function of frequency
for σs = 10σ0. (c) Surface plot
of the intensity pattern on the 2D-sheet, demonstrating SPP focusing
at the desired focal spot calculated using eq 19 where the conductivity of the blocks σs = 10σ0. (d) Intensity pattern calculated
using COMSOL for the three-dimensional structure for comparison with
a finite block of height and depth equal to 100 nm.

The computation of electromagnetic fields of the
surface waves
through such a three-dimensional system can also be reduced to an
analytic model when the condition in eq 11 is satisfied by the media on both sides.
The model has been derived on the basis of rigorous coupled wave analysis36 formalism, which is mainly developed for diffraction
gratings with a nonzero thickness. Here, we modify it for the case
of a spatially modulated interface (a zero-thickness interface grating)
between two half-spaces with a conductivity profile defined by σH(y).

To do so, we begin with the modification
of the boundary condition
in eq 7 to include (1)
the effective spatially dependent conductivity pattern of the boundary
and (2) the diffraction orders of the SPP wave originated due to the
pattern. Note that as long as the condition in eq 4 or 11 is satisfied,
the vertical decay profiles of all of the waves are identical, forcing
all of the diffraction orders to be surface waves traveling in different
in-plane directions. The modified boundary conditions for a conductivity
pattern of σH(y) along the y-axis can be expressed as 13  where each diffraction order is characterized
by its wavevector parallel to the interface ky(g). The exponential function, eiky(g)y, is explicitly
shown in the equation factoring out from the field profile terms in eqs 6 and 8 for clarification purposes. The diffraction orders, characterized
by the parallel wavevector components, are usually discrete following
the Floquet condition ky(g) = ky0 + g2π/Λ,
where Λ is the periodicity of the pattern and ky0 is the component representing the
direction of the incident wave. If σH(y) profile is not periodic in y (as is the case of
the FZP condition), then a supercell structure with virtually infinite
periodicity (Λ → ∞) can be imagined, transforming
the discrete set of ky(g) components
into a continuous spectrum. Note that as the sheets are assumed to
be isotropic, the in-plane wavevector components of all of the diffraction
orders has to be conserved following the condition kS;m2 = ky(g)2 + kz;m(g)2.

Expanding the conductivity profile into its Fourier
harmonics 14  and by applying convolution to the
double
sum in the last term of eq 13, the modified boundary condition can be reduced to a matrix
form. Utilizing the orthogonality of the exponential basis functions,
the boundary condition in the matrix form can be represented as 15  where now the quantities Ex± and Hy± are diagonal
matrices with
each element along the diagonal representing the field profile in eq 8 for each diffraction order
characterized by ky(g). The matrix
Ξ is the convoluted matrix of Fourier harmonics of the conductivity
profile where ijth element can be expressed as 16  Multiplying the electric field equation
in eq 15 with each magnetic
field
component and vice versa, the modified boundary conditions can be
solved for reflection and transmission coefficient matrices, relating
the amplitude vectors of the diffraction orders, AL– = rSPPAL+ and AR+ = tSPPAL+, as 17  where MIJ has the same
definition as in eq 10 and 18  kz;L and kz;R are diagonal
matrices where the elements are kz{L,R}(g) values of each diffraction order. The total electric and
magnetic field components can be expressed as a sum of the field components
of all diffraction orders as 19  where I represents L,R depending
on the location of r⃗. Notice that when the
interface between the two spaces has a homogeneous conductivity profile
(i.e., σH(y) = const), the SPP does
not scatter into diffraction orders, which reduces the matrices in eq 17 to singleton elements.
A similarity in eqs 17 and 1 can be seen in such a case, representing
an analogy between the scattering of a plane wave at a conducting
interface and the scattering of a SPP wave at a conducting interface
perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

To demonstrate
focusing of SPP waves using FZP, three rings (six
blocks) are considered perpendicular to the 2D-sheet, as shown in Figure 4c. The pattern is
symmetric with respect to the xz-plane. On each side,
the radius in eq 12 defines
the position of transition from the transparent (gap) to the opaque
(block) region. Hence, the position (of the nearest corner to the
center) of each block is given by r1, r3, and r5 and the
lateral width of each block is given by r2 – r1, r4 – r3, and r6 – r5, respectively.
In Figure 4c, the geometry
is designed to focus the SPP wave at f = 4λSPP. The vertical component of the electric field on top of
the 2D-sheet at the focal line is calculated using eq 19. Figure 4b represents the evolution of the focal spot
as a function of the surface conductivity of the blocks. As expected,
as the surface conductivity of the blocks increases, the SPP wave
gets tightly focused on the plane of the 2D-sheet. The size (full-width
at half-maximum) of the focal spot is found to be equal to the width
of the last (third) ring, which is one of the properties of the FZPs.
The size of the focal spot can be minimized by adding more rings.
The inset of Figure 4b represents the bandwidth of the focal spot. For the same geometry,
the field along the focal plane is calculated by varying the frequency
of the incident light. The focal spot appears for a reasonable bandwidth
range (around 5 THz). Figure 4c represents the surface plot of the intensity pattern overlapped
on the structure demonstrating a tight focus near the focal spot.

The primary difference between the actual three-dimensional structure
and the assumed design in the above formalism is the height of the
blocks (assumed to be infinite). The assumption is valid as long as
the height (and depth) of the blocks is greater than the SPP decay
length. To validate the above formulation, numerical simulations are
performed on the actual three-dimensional structure using the FEM
software (COMSOL Multiphysics), where the height and depth of the
blocks are considered to be finite (100 nm each). An SPP wave is excited
on the xy-plane along the red solid line shown in Figure 4d. The calculated
intensity demonstrates a pattern identical to that in Figure 4c, validating both the concept
of focusing SPP waves using the FZP condition and the described analytic
approach. Note that the media in left and right half-spaces are considered
identical in this example; however, the principle works as long as
the condition in eq 11 is satisfied.

The same phenomenon can also be observed using
a complementary
structure where the screens are replaced with holes in the 2D-sheet
with the same lateral dimension. The focusing efficiency in the case
of FZP primarily depends on the opacity and transparency of the rings
of the pattern. As the SPPs on 2D-sheets are known to reflect from
the discontinuities in the 2D-sheets, a screen can be realized just
by drilling a rectangular hole into the 2D-sheet. We observe that
gaps of width 30 nm (≈λSPP/7.5) nearly reflect
back 80% of the SPP wave, enough to demonstrate the focusing principle
using the FZP condition.

A schematic of the hole design is shown
in Figure 5a, where
holes are drilled in a homogeneous
2D-sheet. In practice, zero surface conductivity locally in a regime
can also be achieved by chemical bonds.11 Utilizing eq 17 to
calculate the electromagnetic fields is not a straightforward process
in the case of holes. A rectangular hole (slit or gap) in a homogeneous
2D-sheet reflects and refracts SPP waves acting like a perpendicular
conducting interface similar to that in Figure 4. To approximate it as an interface between
two half-spaces, the effective surface conductivity of the hole pattern
needs to be calculated. Here, we calibrate the “hole”
conductivity pattern by calculating the reflection and transmission
coefficients through it and using a numerical fitting method. The
model we assume for the fitting process is shown in the inset of Figure 5b. We assume that
the effective conductivity of the hole (σeff) is
linearly proportional to the gap size (σeff = σfdg/λSPP), where
σf is the fit parameter and dg is the gap width. The actual reflection and transmission
coefficients of the SPP are calculated using the mode-matching analysis28,29 and has been fit to eq 17 to calculate σf. The calculated reflection
and transmission coefficients along with the fit curves are shown
in Figure 5b. Note
that the model is valid to approximate the absolute value of the reflection
and transmission coefficients but not the phase because the thickness
of the gap is ignored.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic of the in-plane SPP diffraction setup using
rectangular
holes. (b) Calculated and fit curves of the reflection and transmission
coefficients of SPPs as a function of gap width (dg). The inset shows the model for calibration. Surface
conductivity on the two sides of the gap is assumed to be σ0 = 0 + 0.074i for the model. The 2D-sheets are placed on a
substrate (ε = 2.25) with vacuum on top; λ0 = 10 μm and λSPP ≈ 227 nm. The extracted
fit parameter σf in this case is 0.3791 + 2.7346i.
(c) Surface plot of the intensity pattern on the 2D-sheet demonstrating
SPP focusing at the desired focal spot (f = 4λSPP) calculated using eq 19 for the hole width dg =
30 nm, λ0 = 10 μm, and σ0 =
0.0008 + 0.074i (ns = 7.4 × 1016 m–2) on both sides. (d) The intensity
pattern calculated using COMSOL for the three-dimensional structure
with actual holes for comparison. The focal spot shifted to a distance
of λSPP/2 due to the additional phase difference
of (π) added by the holes.

Once the effective conductivity of the hole is calibrated, eq 17 can safely be applied
to the hole system. Figure 5c represents the intensity pattern through a hole system where
the lateral dimensions of the holes are designed according to eq 12 and the width along
the z-axis is considered to be dg = 30 nm ≈ 0.13λSPP. SPP waves
focus at the target line as expected. The actual three-dimensional
structure with holes is simulated using COMSOL and is presented in Figure 5d for comparison
with the same excitation process as in Figure 4d. A shift in the focal spot position (exactly
equal to λSPP/2) is observed in the COMSOL simulations
with an actual three-dimensional structure due to an additional (π)
phase difference added by the holes.

6 Generalized
Refraction of SPPs
In this section, we demonstrate manipulation of SPP propagation
confined to the 2D-sheet using the recent innovative modification
of the Fresnel equations known as the generalized law of refraction.20,37 It has been demonstrated that the refraction of plane waves can
be deviated from the fundamental Fresnel refraction angle by adding
an engineered phase gradient to the refracting interface; the emerging
area of metasurfaces.38−42 The required phase gradients have been obtained by patterning the
surfaces with various types of resonating elements of subwavelength
dimensions.43,44

Analogously, resonating
elements can be implanted on the 2D-sheets
to manipulate the propagation of SPPs. We demonstrate that the resonating
element here can be as simple as a line of rectangular holes drilled
into the 2D-sheet with subwavelength dimensions.45,46 The physical dimension of the holes being zero in the direction
perpendicular to the 2D-sheet, we call them “metalines”;
drawn on top of the 2D-sheet to manipulate the surface wave.

The resonance characteristics of in-plane periodic hole antennae
in response to SPP excitation are presented in Figure 6a,c,d. The unit cell considered for the characterization
is shown in Figure 6b. The in-plane hole antennae are considered with fixed width (5
nm in the direction of SPP propagation along the z-axis). The periodicity (Λ) of the unit cell is considered
to be λSPP/5. The amplitude and phase of the scattered
(SPP) wavefront are calculated using the FEM software (COMSOL Multiphysics)
by varying the length of the hole from 0.05 to 0.95 Λ. Figure 6a represents the
magnitudes of the electric field normal components scattered through
the holes in the range between 0.35 and 0.90 Λ, demonstrating
excitation of resonant gap modes around 0.6 Λ.47

Figure 6 Generalized refraction of SPPs on the 2D-sheet using phase gradient
of in-plane hole antennae. (a) Calculated amplitude of the electric
field normal component using COMSOL for the unit cell shown in (b)
for hole widths ranging from l = 0.35 to 0.90 Λ.
Resonant behavior is observed at l = 0.60 Λ.
The slit width is 5 nm. Calculated phase (c) and amplitude (d) of
the SPP wave transmitted through the hole antennae as a function of
hole width l. (e) and (f) represent the calculated
normal component of the electric field normalized to the incident
field for “metaline” defects with hole antennae arranged
for θb = 10 and 20°, respectively. White, black,
and green solid lines in (e) and (f) represent the normal, propagation,
and wavefront directions, respectively. In all calculations, λ0 = 10 μm, σ0 = 0.0008 + 0.074i (ns = 7.4 × 1016 m–2) and εsub = 2.25.

The corresponding phase and amplitudes are presented
in Figure 6b, where
due to the
resonance a phase gradient nearly ranging between −0.8π
and +0.8π is observed. The amplitude of the transmitted field
is not uniform, which hinders the performance of the wavefront. More
variations in the shape of the hole can be considered to have uniform
transmittance; however, here we aim at demonstrating the proof of
concept with a simple geometry.

The capabilities of the hole
antennae to bend the SPP wave in-plane
has been demonstrated in Figure 6c,d. The holes are drilled in the 2D-sheet along a
line with a uniform center-to-center spacing of Λ. The length
of each hole is chosen to have a uniform phase gradient from right
to left (−y direction), and the number of
holes is chosen to cover the full available phase range. The phase
gradient required to bend the wavefront to an angle θb is calculated as 20  

FEM (COMSOL) simulations are performed
using SPP excitation on
the unit cells designed according to the above description aiming
at a bending angle of 10 and 20°. The resultant field patterns
demonstrating the wavefront bending to expected angles are presented
in Figure 6e,f, respectively.
The solid lines in Figure 6e,f represent the normal to the defect line (white), the direction
of propagation (black), and wavefront (green) of the surface waves.
The nonuniformity of the resultant wavefront is due to the lower transmission
amplitudes of the holes in some regions. The bending of wavefronts
to expected angles demonstrates that SPP can be manipulated using
the generalized Fresnel law similar to plane waves.

In conclusion,
we demonstrated that on proper design of the conductivity
profile of 2D materials, the out-of-plane scattering of SPP waves
can be dramatically minimized at abrupt intersections. In such a design,
the propagation characteristics of SPPs resemble the propagation characteristics
of plane waves, enabling the engineering of complex optoelectronic
devices using fundamental laws of optics. Utilizing the above resemblance,
we demonstrated designs of plasmonic–photonic crystals to localize
the surface wave into deep subwavelength volumes. In addition, under
the same criteria, SPPs also obey the diffraction laws identical to
plane-wave diffraction, facilitating more methods to control the SPP
propagation in the plane of the material. We demonstrated focusing
of SPPs using FZPs, a device primarily designed for plane waves. In
addition, under the same criteria, SPPs are also observed to obey
the generalized Fresnel refraction laws. A design based on line defects
(metaline) is presented to manipulate the propagation of SPP waves
in the plane of the 2D-sheets based on the generalized law of refraction,
giving a finer control on engineering the SPP propagation on the 2D-sheets.
Whereas we illustrated the proof of concept with a few examples, many
existing laws of plane-wave optics can be transferred to SPP waves
using the proposed criteria and mathematical formulation.
