Nanostructured materials with hollow
interior voids are gaining
great attention due to their fantastic geometries and unique physicochemical
properties competent for many applications. However, the development
of a fast approach to prepare the hollow structured particles remains
challenging. Herein, a new and efficient in situ hard-template method
was developed to synthesize hollow carbon nano- and microparticles
using the as-prepared SiO2 particles as a hard template
directly, without any separation, drying, or redispersion. In this
way, the hollow carbon particles with tunable diameters and shell
thickness can be synthesized readily, which is simpler and more efficient
than the traditional ones. In addition, the universality of this strategy
allows us to study the different behaviors of hollow carbon particles
in lithium–sulfur batteries when the architectures of hollow
particles (i.e., diameter, shell thickness, etc.) were changed. We
believe that this in situ method is applicable for synthesizing other
core–shell or hollow structured materials (e.g., metal oxide),
and also, the high performance of hollow carbon particles in lithium–sulfur
batteries and beyond can be further explored.

Introduction
Hollow carbon nano- and microparticles
have widespread applications
in the fields of catalysis,1 electrochemistry,2,3 energy (e,g., dye-sensitized solar cells),4 supercapacitors,5 rechargeable batteries,6−8 and biotechnology9,10 due to their hollow structure,
physical stability, chemical inertness, high conductivity, and biocompatibility.
To date, the most commonly used synthesis approach has been the well-known
hard-template method,11 the steps of which
usually consist of the synthesis of core particles as a template followed
by coating the presynthesized core particles (e.g., silica gel,12 polystyrene,13 or
metal (oxide) nanoparticles14,15) with a layer of carbon
and finally removing the core to form a hollow structure. Despite
considerable research on this process having been carried out over
the past few decades, a significant problem remains in that the core
particles aggregate after centrifugation and drying before they are
reused as templates. One effective approach has been a long ultrasonic
treatment in order to redisperse the core particles; however, the
individual and uniform distribution of core particles from the dried
solid powders in solution appears to be irreversible in most cases,
such as in the redispersion of silica gel.16−22 Inevitably, the aggregation of core particles results in a poor
distribution of the interior hollow structures of particles. To overcome
this problem and simplify the process, we present an in situ hard-template
method for the synthesis of hollow carbon particles in which the as-prepared
core particles are directly used as templates without any separation.

Then the hollow carbon particles with tunable diameters and shell
thickness were synthesized readily, which is simpler and more efficient
than the traditional ones. In addition, the feasibility of our strategy
allows us to study the different electrochemical behaviors of hollow
carbon particles in lithium–sulfur batteries when the architectures
of hollow particles (i.e., diameter, shell thickness, etc.) were changed.
We hope that this in situ method is applicable for synthesizing more
core–shell, yolk–shell, and hollow structured materials
for wider applications with greater performances besides the lithium–sulfur
battery application.

Results and Discussion
Synthetic Features
The great features of our presented
strategy are being efficient, convenient, and cost-effective in which
there is no need for separation during the hard-template method (Figure 1a). In detail, silica
gel templates with different particle diameters were prepared first
by varying the molar ratio of (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS,
0.1–10 g) and water (Figure 1b). Sucrose was then added as a carbon source (0.5–15.4
g), and water was then added into the primary silica gel solution
while stirring. Next, the mixture underwent hydrothermal treatment
in an autoclave while stirring for several hours. The core–shell
structured SiO2@C-rich particles were formed after the
hydrothermal reaction (C-rich indicates that the shell materials are
rich in carbonaceous materials23) (Figure 1c). After this step,
hollow carbon particles were obtained followed by the carbonization
of SiO2@C-rich to SiO2@C and then HF etching
of the SiO2 core.

image of SiO2@C.

Architectural Features
The hollow carbon particles
(i.e., HCP) with different diameters were obtained as shown in Figure 2. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
show that well-dispersed hollow carbon particles with an average diameter
of 162 nm were prepared using 0.5 g of MPTMS and 2.0 g of sucrose
(Figure 2a,b,a1) (i.e.,
HCP-162-22). Note that the abbreviation of the HCP-diameter-shell
thickness means the hollow carbon particles with a certain diameter
and shell thickness. By increasing the amount of carbon precursor
in the form of sucrose from 2.0 to 3.3 g, the average shell thickness
could be finely controlled from 22 to about 34 nm (Figure 2b1,c,c1). This result confirms
that the shell thickness can be readily tuned by varying the concentration
of carbon precursors. Alternatively, by increasing the amounts of
MPTMS and sucrose to 10 and 15.4 g simultaneously, large, hollow carbon
particles with an average diameter of 415 nm were synthesized. Their
shell thickness was about 82 nm, and their spherical interior void
was 251 nm in diameter (i.e., HCP-415-82). Increasing the amount of
MPTMS increased the size of the silica particles, and increasing the
amount of sucrose increased the thickness of the particle shells.
Note that the hollow carbon particles prepared using this strategy
have high surface areas. For example, high surface areas of 1631 and
1495 cm2 g–1 with a broad pore size distribution
were confirmed for the samples HCP-162-22 and HCP-415-82 (Figure 3).

The unit of dv/dD is cm3 g–1 nm–1.

Moreover, a series of particles of different sizes (130–415
nm) and shell thicknesses (8–82 nm) could be synthesized by
changing the amounts of MPTMS and sucrose (Figure 4). This experiment demonstrates the feasibility
of this method. Using this strategy, the SiO2 core particles
were used directly without any separation, washing, drying, or redispersion,
which is very different from other methods.16−22 In addition, the SiO2 core can be removed completely,
as confirmed by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Figure 4c). These results
confirm that an in situ hard template can be used to prepare hollow
carbon particles over a wide range of sizes and shell thicknesses.
More importantly, this concept can be easily extended to other kinds
of systems with different core particles, such as polystyrene,24 carbon colloids,25 and metal (oxide) nanoparticles.26 This
approach facilitates the preparation of core–shell structured
and hollow metal (oxide) particles at reduced energy and cost as it
is simpler and more effective than traditional hard-template methods.

Sulfur Impregnation
To date, research
has focused on
the use of varied carbon materials in lithium–sulfur batteries
because nanostructured carbon materials such as layered graphene (oxide),27 carbon nanotubes,28 and porous carbon29 play a critical role
in embedding sulfur, enhancing the conductivity of electrodes, and
suppressing diffusion of the polysulfide intermediates in order to
maintain good cyclic performance. Previous results have confirmed
the role of carbon as the host for sulfur.9−11 Recently, some
efforts have focused on using hollow carbon particles as substrates
due to their intriguing hollow structures.30−32 However, the
electrochemical properties have always been studied under a relative
low current density (e.g., 0.1, 0.25 C, wherein 1 C = 1675 mA g–1) due to the intrinsic fast capacity degradation of
Li–S battery systems, especially at high current densities.
Herein, we investigated the performances of three kinds of hollow
carbon particles in lithium–sulfur applications at a high current
density (e.g., 1 C) and found that one type showed good performance.
We also discuss the effects of particle size and shell thickness on
electrochemical properties.

First, sulfur was impregnated into
hollow carbon particles using the vapor method. After impregnation,
the S@HCP composite still maintained its spherical structure and showed
relatively individual distribution (Figure 5a,b). The elemental distribution analysis
of a typical S@HCP-415-82 particle confirms the presence of a large
amount of sulfur concentrated in the hollow interior (Figure 5c). However, due to the differences
in particle size and shell thickness, the hollow carbon particles
showed different abilities to encapsulate sulfur and increase shell
thickness. As shown in Figure 5d, HCP-415-82 particles demonstrated the highest sulfur content
(58.5 wt %) compared with HCP-162-22 (48.2 wt %) and HCP-174-34 (55.0
wt %). Particle size and shell thickness clearly determine the sulfur-encapsulation
ability, even when particles have similar hollow structures. Moreover,
the variation in the evaporation curves of sulfur from the S@HCP composite
demonstrates the difference in strength between the carbon host and
sulfur (Figure 5d).
The HCP-162-22 particles show the strongest interaction with sulfur.
The temperature at which complete evaporation occurred was about 430
°C, which is much higher than those of HCP-174-34 (300 °C)
and HCP-415-82 (340 °C). Besides, the comparative XRD patterns
of the HCP-415-82 and S@ HCP-415-82 also confirm that sulfur was impregnated
into the hollow carbon spheres.

side of the shell. (d) Thermogravimetric analysis of hollow composite

Lithium–Sulfur Applications
The electrochemical
measurements were performed in the half-cell using the electrolytes
of 1.0 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and
0.4 M LiNO3 in 1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME,
v/v = 1/1). A typical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of S@HCP-415-82
particles within a cutoff voltage window of 1.8–2.8 V is shown
in Figure 6a. According
to the mechanisms for oxidation and reduction of S8 during
discharge–charge,33,34 the peak at around
2.37 V could be attributed to the reduction of elemental sulfur to
higher-order lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, 4 ≤ x < 8).35 Generally, these polysulfides were in a metastable phase
and could dissolve easily into the electrolyte, thereby giving rise
to the degradation of the Li–S battery during the charge–discharge
process.36,37 The characteristic peak near 2.04 V was
caused by further reduction of the higher-order lithium polysulfides
to lower-order lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, x < 2) and eventually to Li2S.38−40 Inversely, the oxidation process in the Li–S
cell also occurs in two stages. The oxidation peak at 2.42 V can be
attributed to the formation of Li2Sx (x > 2) from Li2S. This
process
continues until the lithium polysulfide is completely consumed and
elemental sulfur is produced at 2.53 V. As the cycle number increases,
the CV peak positions and intensities only undergo very small changes,
indicating the relatively good reversibility and stability. This appears
to be due to the hollow interior structure and the suitable thickness
of the shell, which is beneficial for preventing the loss of sulfur
into the electrolyte and maintaining high utilization of the active
sulfur in the redox reactions.32,41−44

The electrochemical performance
of S@HCP-415-82 was further demonstrated
by the voltage versus capacity profiles (Figure 6b), which is well consistent with the CV
curves. We find that the cell can cycle well at a high rate of 1 C
with an initial capacity of 900 mA h g–1. Besides,
the average capacity can achieve 792 mA h g–1 in
the initial 100 cycles where the capacity retention is 76.3%. By contrast,
average capacities of 570 and 447 mA h g–1 were
obtained for the S@HCP-174-34 and S@HCP-162-22, respectively. The
capacities of the Li–S cell using the S@HCP-174-34 and S@HCP-162-22
electrodes decrease from 773 to 384 mA h g–1 and
from 703 to 250 mA h g–1 with capacity retentions
of 49.5 and 35.4%, respectively, after the same cycling period (Figure 6c). Thus, the S@HCP-415-82
composite exhibits the best performance. In addition, high capacities
of 1391, 1160, 985, 845, 658, and 338 mA h g–1 can
be delivered for the S@HCP-415-82 at rates of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5,
and 5 C, respectively (Figure 6d). Although these results show the effect of particle size
and shell thickness on electrochemical performance, rational correlation
and reason for the difference need to be further investigated due
to the complexities of the reduction and oxidation processes in lithium–sulfur
batteries.45−47 Our preliminary results show that a medium particle
size could be probably good for the fast transportation of electrons
and lithium ions during the reactions (Figure 6e), while a small particle size (i.e., small
hollow voids) and a thin shell thickness might decrease the transportation
rate of electrons and lithium ions. In addition, a too small particle
size might bring more contact boundaries within the electrode and
then cause an increased electric resistance, thereby leading to a
low sulfur utilization and a low capacity (Figure 6f). Besides, the thin shell is not good for
suppressing the lithium polysulfide shuttling effect because the polysulfide
is easy to diffuse outside from the hollow particles. As a result,
the S@HCP-415-82 demonstrates a good rate capability and long cycle
life over 200 cycles even at a high rate of 2.5 C, under which a high
average capacity of 578 mA h g–1 can be delivered
(Figure 7).

Conclusions
In summary, a simple and efficient in situ hard-template
method
was developed to synthesize hollow carbon nano- and microparticles
using SiO2 particles as a template directly, without any
separation, drying, or redispersion. This strategy not only bypasses
tedious steps such as centrifugation, oven drying of core particles,
and particle redispersion but also reduces the cost and energy consumption
compared to traditional methods. Undoubtedly, this concept could be
further extended to other kinds of systems in which polystyrene, carbon,
and metal (oxide) particles are used as templates to synthesize core–shell
structured and hollow particles. Additionally, the prepared hollow
carbon particles have good performance in the lithium–sulfur
battery application, particularly at the high rate conditions. We
found that particle size and shell thickness largely determine electrochemical
performance, which will be helpful for further investigations of hollow
carbon particles in lithium–sulfur batteries and beyond.

Experimental
Section
Materials Preparations
The hollow carbon particles
were synthetized, and sulfur impregnation was carried out as follows.
First, 0.4–10 g of (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethyloxysilane (MPTMS)
(Sigma Aldrich) was added dropwise into 100 mL of distilled water
with vigorous stirring until the solution became transparent. Next,
0.05 mL of NH4OH was added to the solution (pH = 11), and
the reaction was allowed to progress for 12 h at room temperature.
After completion of the reaction, a silica colloidal solution with
monodispersed SiO2 particles was formed. Subsequently,
1.0–15.4 g of carbon precursor was dissolved into 200 mL of
distilled water and mixed with the SiO2 colloidal solution,
which was then transferred into a stainless steel autoclave. Hydrothermal
treatment was carried out at 180 °C for 5 h. The resulting slurry
was filtered and washed with distilled water and ethanol. The obtained
powder was vacuum-dried at 100 °C for 24 h and annealed at 1000
°C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere. The resulting black powder
was immersed in an aqueous HF solution for 24 h to etch away the SiO2 template followed by filtration and washing. After this step,
hollow carbon particles (HCP) were obtained. For the sulfur impregnation,
0.3 g of hollow carbon particles and 1. 0 g of elemental sulfur were
placed on the separated ends of a Y-type glass, and then the Y-type
tube was sealed under vacuum. The Y-type glass tube was then heated
to 600 °C over 4 h (heating rate, 2 °C min–1) and then cooled to room temperature.

Materials Characterizations
The architectural structures
of particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
which was performed on a field-emission Hitachi S-4800 instrument
operating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The core–shell
and hollow characteristics of particles were confirmed by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), which was performed using an FEI Tecnai
G2 S-Twin instrument with a field-emission gun operating at 200 kV.
Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed from room temperature
to 500 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under the N2 flow using an STA 449 Jupiter (NETZSCH)
thermogravimetry analyzer. The N2 adsorption/desorption
measurements were conducted with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument
at −196 °C after the sample was degassed at 200 °C
for 6 h under vacuum conditions. The pore sizes were estimated from
the pore size distribution curves from the adsorption isotherms using
the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.

Electrochemical
Measurement
The sulfur-based electrode
was prepared as follows. The active materials S@HCP and polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) binder were mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP) to form a uniform slurry, which was then cast on the Al foil
and then roll-pressed after vacuum drying at 40 °C to remove
the residual solvent. The sulfur loading on the electrode was controlled
at around 1.23 mg cm–2. The electrode was punched
into a circular piece before assembling the battery. The electrochemical
tests with the configuration of S@HCP-based electrode|separator|metallic
lithium were performed using R2032 coin-type cells, which were assembled
in an argon-filled glove box using the electrolytes of 1.0 M LiTFSI
and 0.4 M LiNO3 in DOL/DME. The used volume of the electrolyte
for each cell was about 150 μL. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies
were performed using a VMP3 electrochemical workstation at a scan
rate of 0.25 mV s–1 (Bio-Logic). The galvanostatic
charge–discharge performances were measured under cutoff voltages
of 1.8–2.8 V using a Land battery testing system at room temperature.
