Olfactory
is an extremely fine way of perception. However, the process of smelling
is prone to various interference factors. Further development to enhance
the communication desires an odor-releasing strategy, which could
quantitatively offer a variety of fragrances. Here, we report a fully
printing strategy to heterogeneously integrate odor-containing materials
and protective coating films. Inspired from the fragrance-containing
drum structure on the geranium leaf, encapsulated arrays are fully
printed on the flexible or rigid substrates with more than 20 spices.
Quantitative concentrations of odor molecules can be released from
the encapsulated arrays after scraping the protective poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) shells. Importantly, various odor-based
arrays are printed on the same flexible substrate, which permits selective
releasing and arbitrary mixing of the spices. Effective odor-releasing
properties of encapsulated arrays make them promising for food security
and anticounterfeiting, investigating olfactory discrimination abilities,
and strengthening olfactory communication.

1 Introduction
Olfactory
is an extremely fine way of perception, which can be linked to the
mood and health status.1 In addition, psychological
experiments prove that the olfactory center of the brain has a close
relationship with the limbic system.2 Where
the limbic system controls emotions, fear, and memories, it can be
concluded that the odor can affect our thinking.3 Odor-mediated communication between individuals, once thought
to be limited to “lower animals”, is now understood
to carry information about familial relationships, stress, and anxiety
levels.4−6 Olfactory sensitivity and discrimination abilities
will degenerate with age. Impaired olfaction is a leading indicator
of certain neurodegenerative diseases, notably, Parkinson’s
disease7 and Alzheimer’s disease.8,9 However, the process of “smelling” is prone to various
interference factors, such as the scent of scent, odor residue, and
the variety of odors.10,11 The olfactory sensitivity estimation
is strongly influenced by the species of odors being tested.12−14 It is desirable to explore a controllable odor-releasing strategy
to cover a variety of spices.

In nature, the transmission of
biological information, such as the pheromones among plants and animals,15,16 is one of the most fascinating research fields in the life sciences.
More than the fragrance of flowers, the aroma of many plants’
aromatic oils is good for human health.17 Scented geranium is a perennial trailing herb extensively cultivated
for the essential oil present in its leaves, which is used as a cheap
substitute for the attar of roses. On the leaves of geranium, there
are many drum-structured microcavities (secretory head of glandular
trichomes), which are full of odor molecules.18 The volatile materials in the drums are known as the geranium oil,
which will not react chemically or physically with the drum cuticle.
The fragrance is released due to the rupture of these drums, which
can be caused by external factors such as high temperature and low
air humidity or caused by the physical contact from an animal or insect.
Thus, the air is heavy with the scent of flowers after softly rubbing
these leaves.

Here, we demonstrate a fully printed method to
fabricate geranium-inspired odor-containing encapsulated arrays for
programmable release of more than 20 spices. By controlling the wetting
behaviors of spice inks and poly(lactic-co-glycolic)
acid (PLGA, an FDA approved polymer) inks, PLGA completely covered
the previously printed droplets arrays with the location of the pattern.19 All oil-soluble, water-soluble, and emulsion
spices can be encapsulated in the PLGA drums via this fully printing
strategy. Similar to the release mechanism on how the scent of geranium
is released after rubbing, odor molecules can be released from the
microarray-based chips after rubbing the protective PLGA shells. Figure 1 illustrates the
mechanism of fully printing geranium-inspired odor-containing arrays.
The aromatic smell of the geranium is due to the release of essential
oils from the glandular trichomes. There is a space for storing geranium
oil between the secretory cephalic cell membrane and the stratum corneum.
It has been studied that there are no pores on the stratum corneum
and the release of the fragrance is due to the rupture of these shells.
By mimicking this drum-structured microcavity, the two-step printing
strategy is investigated to achieve the dynamic control of the spice
and PLGA droplet behavior.20−22 More than 20 kinds of spices
(water-based or oil-based solution) can be printed on the desired
substrates (silicon, glass, or plastic). Both the droplet behaviors
on the substrates and on the previous printed droplets23,24 have been investigated to fabricate the effective odor-release architectures.
Developing the corresponding technology may be economically sensible
for upgrading of consumption and promoting the production of odor-mediated
communication products.

arrays for customizable odor releasing. (a) The photograph and optical
microscopy of geranium. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image

illustration of the two-step printing strategy to fabricate the geranium-inspired
encapsulated arrays. The first step is to ink-jet print aqueous dots
with various spice inks. The second step is to print poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) inks on the spice dot arrays as
the protective shell.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of Core–Shell
Odor-Releasing Encapsulated Arrays
Figure 1b shows the detailed structures of drum-structured
microcavity before and after rubbing. There are two types of head
gland hairs on the leaves. The hair (colored by red) has a large secretory
head. The secretions are mainly concentrated in the epidermis cavity
where the fragrance is stored. Apparently, there are no pores on these
hairs. The fragrance is only released after the rupture of these hairs
(Figure 1b and Figure S5). In nature, the scent of geranium
is caused by the physical contact from an animal or insect, which
attracts more insects to gather honey and spread pollen. From the
lateral view of the broken hairs, the wall thickness is 1.32 ±
0.29 μm, while the undamaged microcavity is about 30.25 μm.
The protective shell made from cells is firm enough to store fragrant
oils against the moderate external force. In the force test experiment
of the geranium leaves, the minimum force is 2.5 ± 0.3 N to make
us smell the fragrance, which is close to the normal force people
used while holding the pencil to write (about 2.98 N).25 The individuals from children to elders can
rub the leaves easily to smell the fragrance. Inspired by this microcavity
structure and the release mode, spice inks are covered by the uniform
shell while the odor release is achieved by the rupture of shells
after the moderate force. As shown in the Figure 1c, the two-step ink-jet printing method is
investigated to imitate the encapsulated structure of the geranium
leaf. The PLGA shell gap with the prolate border sealed the spice
ink without any voids or gaps, which keeps odors for a certain time.
It is essential to fabricate these encapsulated arrays after investigating
the droplet diffusion, coalescence, and drying behavior during the
printing process.

The key problem is to fabricate core–shell26-encapsulated arrays for the quantitative release
of diversiform odorous molecules. The capsules contain an aqueous
core with odorous molecules and a PLGA protective shell.25 To imitate the fragrance storage and release
mode of the geranium leaves, the shell keeps the spice droplet intact
and can be easily scraped with a moderate force (about 2.5 N) to release
the odors.23,24 In recent years, the inkjet printing
method has been widely used in the patterning of functional materials
at a large area. By combining the encapsulated design and printing
strategy,27,28 the programmable droplet preparation can
be availably achieved. The printed droplets can be well controlled
via investigating the wetting and dewetting processes for the accurate
odor release of encapsulated arrays.

The first step was to print
the aqueous cores, which contains various kinds of odorous molecules
with the controlled concentration and volume. As shown in the Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, two
types of the spices (water-based and oil-based spices) were used to
produce odor-releasing laminas. To ensure the printability of the
aqueous core inks, ethylene glycol was added to adjust the viscosity
(Figure S3). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)
was added as an emulgator to make the oily molecules dispersed in
the water. A typical formulation of the spice ink consisted of 0.5
g of PVA, 2.5 g of ethylene glycol, and a certain amount of longan,
milk, or vanilla spices (longan and milk spices were water-based,
while vanilla was oil-based) dissolved in 10 g of total solution.
The concentration of fragrance molecules can be regulated according
to the demand. The diameters of the printed spice droplets were regulated
by varying the extrusion time and pressure (Figure S4).

Next, protective shells were in situ printed onto
the spice droplets. To achieve encapsulating the aqueous cores and
achieving controllable core release, we dissolved PLGA in dichloromethane
before printing.29 The oil-based ink with
PLGA was directly printed onto the spice droplets on the substrate.
The dichloromethane/water interface is case-hardened due to the flash
evaporation of dichloromethane at room temperature (about 3 s). The
uniform PLGA shells would appear as soon as dichloromethane evaporated.
Thus, the solidified capsules can be readily printed in various preset
patterns to create programmable capsule arrays.

2.2 Precise Fabrication of water-core and oil-shell Structure
Different kinds of 4 × 9 arrays were printed to achieve core–shell
capsule arrays for quantitative release. Figure 2a displays an optical image of an array of
1 mm diameter core and 2 ± 0.5 mm shell, all of which the distance
between the upper and lower centers is 3 ± 0.2 mm and the distance
between the left and right centers is 4 ± 0.2 mm. The side-view
photographs show the spice ink droplet, PLGA shell on the droplet,
and a clean surface after rubbing (Figure 2b). It is essential for the operation in
the core–shell structure to form a stable oil shell, which
can tightly cover the aqueous phase from the air.

process for encapsulated arrays. (a) Photograph of encapsulated arrays
with core–shell structures (longan on the PET film: the surface
tension of longan aqueous ink is 39.3 mN·m–1, and the contact angle of PET is 60°). Both the enlarged-view
SEM image and the side-view photograph show that each dot has a 1
mm diameter core and a 2 ± 0.5 mm shell. (b) Schematic illustration

illustration of encapsulated droplets with different surface tension
of spice inks and different contact angles of substrates.

PVA in the aqueous core, as an aqueous surfactant, has a
large amount of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and a hydrophobic long
carbon chain. Depending on its amphiphilicity and dispersibility,
PVA has been widely used in oil–water separation and emulsion
polymerization.30 In the printing process,
PVA formed a miscibility layer on the surface of the aqueous core
to wrap the droplets. The interfacial tension of the oil–water
interface will be reduced by the amphiphilicity of the PVA to form
a stable oil–water interface (oil–water core–shell
structure). Brassard et al.31 reported
that the oil phase would surround spontaneously the water core only
if the flowing condition was met 1  where γw–a, γo–a, and γw–o are the interfacial
tension of the water–air, oil–air, and water–oil
interfaces, respectively. Indeed, the oil medium not only reduces
the contact angle hysteresis,32 which can
decrease the contact line friction to drive into the core–shell
structure, but also lowers their interfacial tension32 that accords with the formula 1. As shown in Figure 2c and Figure S6, an aqueous–oil–air
contact line experiences a force that spreads the oil phase around
the water droplet until a complete shell is formed. When the water
droplet is enclosed in oil, it reduces the contact line friction,
as core–shell droplets are actuated in air and the lower surface
tension of dichloromethane than that of water. PLGA-protective layer
will be formed after the flash evaporation of dichloromethane with
a stable core–shell structure.

The aqueous and oil solution
were dyed separately to study the interface of the water–oil
core–shell structure. According to the cross-sectional views
of the confocal microscope in Figure 2d, the green water phase was clearly separated with
the red oil phase. It is obvious that PLGA can well encapsulate the
aqueous odor droplets to form the core–shell structure.

Moreover, Figure 2e and Figure S7 exhibit the relationship
between different tension of aqueous cores and different contact angles
of the substrates, while PLGA in oily ink was keep the same as 2.5
wt %. As shown in Figures S8 and S9, with
the decreased in the surface tension and the increased in the contact
angle of the base, the aqueous droplet spreading area increased gradually.
While the substrate was too hydrophilic, the aqueous droplets spread
instead of beading and the polymer droplet cannot cover it. When the
contact angles were less than 60°, most cannot form the core–shell
structure, most of which area of the aqueous layer was larger than
that of the PLGA layer, which resulted in failure to the core–shell
structure. So, moderately hydrophobic substrates were optimal (contact
angles >60°) as long as we control the surface tension of
the perfume in the range of 20–40 mN·m–1. As shown in Figure S8, the films of
less than 60° in contact angles were heteromorphic and chaotic.
Although some can be core–shell (such as 26.9 or 28.7 mN·m–1 in surface tension and 20 or 40° in contact
angle), they cannot ensure to lock the aqueous core stably because
of the liquid is not beading enough. Although the polymer solution
and aqueous droplet were immiscible, the emulsifier, PVA in the core,
allowed the PLGA solution to wet the odorous droplet fully.25 Moreover, it can form a kinetically core–shell
structure with the aid of the high volatility and small volume of
the carrene.27

2.3 Encapsulated
Arrays with Different Spices on Various Substrates
Smart
flexible packaging is very important for all walks of life.33−35 Packaged goods with the odor-releasing characteristics are an indispensable
part of commodity circulation, which involves food, beverage, perfume,
cosmetics, medicine, and other industries. It is essential that different
odors are printed and encapsulated as predesigned arrays on flexible
substrates to match the arbitrary curvatures. After investigating
the mechanism of two-step printing, we successfully fabricated odor-containing
microarrays with the uniform droplet sizes through optimizing the
spread and shrinkage behaviors of PLGA inks on the first printed droplets.
The photographs display heart-shaped, alphabetical (milk), and flower
odor-containing arrays on the PET films (Figure 3a). The flexible films can be freely bent
without the leakage of odor molecules. Longan, milk, and vanilla are
chosen as the demonstration odors to show the core–shell-encapsulated
arrays on flexible substrates. As shown in the Figure 3b, PLGA completely covers different solvent-based
droplets. Both oil and water-based flavor can be successfully printed.
To make these odor-containing arrays more clearly, vanilla and milk
inks were printed on the glass and silicon substrates. The flashing
images of the droplets under the shell are obtained under the backlight
illumination. It is obvious that plenty of odors in the droplets are
sealed with the PLGA shells, which gives the strong scent after rubbing
off the shells. According to the numerical statistics in Figure 3d, about 86.1% aqueous
droplets are 0.75–1.25 mm in diameter on the PET film and 90.5%
on the glass substrate and 86.1% on the silicon wafer. The concentration
of released odors is precisely controlled through rubbing the number
of fragrance-contained droplets. Thus, the quantitative odor release
can be achieved. Moreover, the combination of different odors can
be simultaneously printed on the same substrates. We can smell out
the longan–milk flavor after rubbing the longan- and milk-containing
encapsulated arrays. Various odor-based arrays are printed on the
same flexible substrate, which permits selective releasing and arbitrary
mixing of the spices. Effective odor-releasing properties of encapsulated
arrays make them promising for investigating olfactory discrimination
abilities and strengthening olfactory communication.

arrays with different spices on various substrates. (a) Customizable
printed encapsulated array patterns on flexible substrate (PET film):
“milk”, heart, and flower. (b) Flexible odor-releasing
arrays with longan, milk, and vanilla fragrance. (c) Diameter distribution
of aqueous odor droplets on PET, glass, and silicon substrates.

2.4 Quantitative Control of
the Odor Releasing
A major problem associated with odor control
is measurement. However, control is difficult with a quantified, simple,
and visual method until the volatile odor gas can be easily collected.
To show the erasable storage property and to test the quantity-controlled
release of odors, we prepared two odor-releasing films with a rose
or NH3 molecules of 4 × 9 arrays and strictly controlled
the diameter of the odor droplets in 1 mm. When the protective layers
were scraped, different amounts of droplets were exposed, which were
quickly oxidized by the KMnO4 (Figure 4a). The color of KMnO4 solution
was changed from purple (without rupture), to pink (release of one
row), to orange-red (release of two rows), to orange (release of three
rows), and finally to yellow color (release of four rows). Moreover,
without the scraping treatment, a fragrance film containing 4 ×
9 core–shell capsules was placed in KMnO4 solution.
After 24 h of immersion, the color of the solution did not change
significantly, indicating that PLGA can effectively protect the fragrance
droplets. Afterwards, in Figure 4b and Figure S10, the NH3 molecules were volatilized from the film after scraping off
the protective layers. NH3 was quickly dissolved in deionized
water on the pH test paper, which caused the pH test strip to change
color and made it into alkaline. The pH test strip was yellow originally
and changed to dark blue along with quantitative ammonium releasing
after rubbing different rows of NH3-encapsulated arrays. Figure 4c shows the linear
relationship between pH values and odor points of NH3.
Significantly, both the optical images and the quantitative release
experiment clearly demonstrate that the odor in encapsulated arrays
is released only when the protective PLGA shells have been destroyed
by friction. The untouched ones are kept safely in the capsules without
releasing. Moreover, this capability, which achieves quantity-controlled
release of odors, will have a great application prospect in the biosensor
and volatile drug therapy.

droplets were exposed, which were quickly oxidized by the KMnO4. Without the scraping treatment, the color was not changed

rubbing different rows of NH3-encapsulated arrays. The

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated a controllable odor-releasing strategy
for covering a variety of spices. Inspired from the fragrance-contained
drum structure on the geranium leaf, encapsulated arrays are fully
printed on the flexible or rigid substrates with more than 20 spices.
Quantitative concentrations of odor molecules can be released from
the microarray-based chips after selectively rubbing the protective
PLGA shells. Importantly, various odor-based microarrays are printed
on the same flexible substrate, which permits selective rupturing
and arbitrary mixing of the spices. Effective odor-releasing properties
of odor-encapsulated arrays make them promising for investigating
olfactory discrimination abilities and strengthening olfactory communication.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Core or
Shell Ink and the Substrate for Ink-Jet Printing
The core
ink formulation consisted of 0.5 g of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Mw
∼ 89,000 – 98,000; Sigma-Aldrich), 2.5 g of ethylene
glycol (analytical purity, Beijing Chemical Works), and aqueous solution
of longan, milk, or vanilla spices (three representative spices, Shanghai
Apple Flower & Fragrance Co., LTD.) dissolved in 10 g of total
solution. Shell inks were prepared with PLGA (75:25, Mw ∼ 110,000;
Jinandaigang Biological Engineering Co., Ltd., 2.5 wt %) in dichloromethane
(analytical purity, Beijing Chemical Works). The glass sheets, silicon
wafers, or PET films were washed by 98% ethyl alcohol and acetone.
Then, they were blow dried with nitrogen gas.

4.2 Preparation
of Customizable Odor-Releasing Lamina by Ink-Jet Printing
The ink was placed in a syringe of 3 cm3 connected to
a needle having an inner diameter of 60 μm and printed by a
multiaxis dispensing system (2400, EFD, see Supporting Information). Specific programs were programmed according to
the patterns. By controlling the air pressure of the ink-jet printer,
ink droplets of different sizes were printed. First, the aqueous cores
were printed on the substrate. Then, the polymer shells were printed
in situ onto the aqueous cores to make the customizable odor-releasing
laminas with a core–shell structure.

4.3 Instruments
and Characterization
The surface tension of all aqueous inks
containing odor molecules was determined in a surface tension meter
(K100SF, Kruss GmbH Germany). The contact angle of the base material
was investigated by a contact angle meter (OCA25, Germany). The side
view images of drops were taken by a contact angle meter (OCA25, Germany).
All photos of the odor-releasing laminas and the images showing the
geranium were taken by a digital camera (Canon 60D, Japan). The microstructure
of the blade surface was investigated by a field-emission scanning
electron microscope (JSM-7500, Japan) and an optical microscope (Olympus
MX40, Japan). The viscosity modulus as a function of the shear rate
for water inks of three kinds of spices was tested by a rheometer
(Anton Paar MCR302, Austria).

4.4 Quantitative
Release Control Experiment
A rose odor-releasing film was
printed with a 4 × 9 dot matrix. A rose odor-releasing film was
placed in a culture dish with 15 mL of KMnO4 (aq, 6.13
× 10–5 mg/mL, Beijing Chemical Works). After
rubbing one row of encapsulated arrays, the color of KMnO4 solution would change to show the concentration of the odor droplets.
A pH test strip (pH = 8.2–10.0, Hangzhou Shisan Co., Ltd.)
was moistened with deionized water (pH = 5.9) and placed at the bottom
of the glass dish. The inks containing NH3 (aq, 25.0–28.0%,
Beijing Chemical Works) and PLGA shell ink were prepared. A NH3 odor-releasing film was printed with a 4 × 9 dot matrix.
After rubbing one row of encapsulated arrays, the pH test paper was
reversed on the NH3 film to show the pH changes.
