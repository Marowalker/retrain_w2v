The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) plays a critical role in mitochondrial calcium uptake
into the matrix. In metazoans, the uniporter is a tightly regulated
multicomponent system, including the pore-forming subunit MCU and
several regulators (MICU1, MICU2, and Essential MCU REgulator, EMRE).
The calcium-conducting activity of metazoan MCU requires the single-transmembrane
protein EMRE. Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), however, developed a simplified uniporter for which the pore-forming
MCU (DdMCU) alone is necessary and sufficient for calcium influx.
Here, we report a crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD)
of DdMCU at 1.7 Å resolution. The DdMCU-NTD contains four helices
and two strands arranged in a fold that is completely different from
the known structures of other MCU-NTD homologues. Biochemical and
biophysical analyses of DdMCU-NTD in solution indicated that the domain
exists as high-order oligomers. Mutagenesis showed that the acidic
residues Asp60, Glu72, and Glu74, which appeared to mediate the interface
II, as observed in the crystal structure, participated in the self-assembly
of DdMCU-NTD. Intriguingly, the oligomeric complex was disrupted in
the presence of calcium. We propose that the calcium-triggered dissociation
of NTD regulates the channel activity of DdMCU by a yet unknown mechanism.

Introduction
Mitochondrial calcium
(Ca2+) homeostasis plays a vital role in regulating various
cellular activities, such as aerobic metabolism and cell apoptosis.1 Several mitochondrial calcium transporters have
been identified to be responsible for the maintenance of an internal
steady state of calcium ions within the cytoplasm.2−4 The Ca2+ uniporter activity responsible for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was reported more than 50 years ago,5,6 and
later this uniporter was demonstrated by electrophysiological measurements
to be an ion channel with remarkably high conductance and selectivity
for calcium.7 It was not until 8 years
ago that the molecular components of the uniporter had been identified.8−12 In vertebrates, the uniporter is a holocomplex consisting of multiple
subunits, including two membrane-spanning subunits and two soluble
proteins in the intermembrane space. The two soluble proteins are
the mitochondrial calcium uptake proteins, MICU1 and MICU2, which
are Ca2+ sensing proteins that gate the activity of the
pore in response to Ca2+ concentrations outside the mitochondria.13−17 The two membrane proteins are the mitochondrial calcium uniporter
(MCU) that forms the Ca2+ conducting channel and the small
single-pass transmembrane (TM) protein EMRE (Essential MCU REgulator).11,18 As its name suggests, EMRE is essential for activating or keeping
the pore in an open conformation, as well as for transducing the Ca2+ sensing from MICU1/2 to MCU.11 Now that the key molecular components of the calcium uniporter have
been identified, more attention is turned to the molecular mechanism
of MCU function and regulation.19

The molecular architecture of the MCU core domain was first revealed
by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and negative stain electron
microscopy (EM) studies, with a truncated Caenorhabditis
elegans (Ce) MCU protein that lacks the extramembrane
N-terminal domain (NTD; residues 1–165).20 The protein, named CeMCU-ΔNTD, contains two TM helices
and adapts a pentameric complex with the second TM helix forming a
hydrophilic pore across the membrane. The DxxE sequence motif critical
for channel activity21 between the first
and the second TM helices forms two carboxylate rings at the entry
of the pore, featuring a Ca2+ selectivity filter.22 In the NMR study, the NTD was not included;
a separate X-ray study determined the high-resolution structure of
the NTD of the human MCU (HsMCU), which adopts a ubiquitin-like fold.23 Another crystal structure of HsMCU72–189 also revealed a β-grasp-like fold with a negatively charged
region that interacts with divalent cations, and this acidic patch
is important for regulating human MCU activity in response to Mg2+ and Ca2+ binding.24 Extensive efforts have been made to obtain the structures of the
full-length MCU since its discovery. In 2018, the overall structures
of the MCU were independently solved by several groups within a couple
of months. The full-length structures of the fungal MCU homologues
of Fusarium graminearum (Fg) and Metarhizium acridum (Ma) have been determined using
X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), revealing
a dimer of dimer assembly of MCU.25 Meanwhile,
the structures of the full-length MCU homologues from Neurospora crassa (Nc), zebrafish, Cyphellophora europaea (Cy), and Neosartorya
fischeri (Nf) have also been determined using cryo-EM,
showing a similar tetrameric fold.26−28 These homologues show
high sequence similarity in their transmembrane domain and share a
similar pore architecture for calcium conductivity. Remarkably, the
NTDs of these homologues also share a high structural similarity,
in spite of the low sequence homology between NTDs. Recently, Wang
et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of the human MCU–EMRE
complex, providing the structural features for the EMRE regulation
on the conformation of HsMCU.29 It is interesting
to note that the NTD adopts a unique side-by-side configuration to
mediate the dimerization of two HsMCU tetramers, which indicates that
the NTD may play an important role in modulating the function of MCU,
although the removal of the NTD does not affect the mitochondrial
Ca2+ uptake.23

Here, we
determined the crystal structure of the NTD of Dictyostelium
discoideum MCU (DdMCU-NTD) (residues 29–126)
at 1.7 Å resolution. Dictyostelium harbors a simplified uniporter
complex, consisting of only the MCU protein (DdMCU) to conduct Ca2+ (Figure S1),11 and no EMRE is required for the channel activity. It has
been shown that the expression of DdMCU alone is able to reconstitute
uniporter activity in yeast mitochondria.30 The same study showed that DdMCU could rescue the mitochondrial
Ca2+ uptake defects in HsMCU or HsEMRE knockout HEK-293T
cells. Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of DdMCU-NTD showed a helix-rich
fold that is completely different from the β-grasp-like structures
of the HsMCU-NTD and other homologues. The structure also revealed
a noncrystallographic interface, including intermolecular interactions
of helix α3 and loop of protomer-A with helix α2 of protomer-B.
We further showed that the DdMCU-NTD formed an oligomer in solution,
consisting of at least four subunits. Mutating residues within the
noncrystallographic interface caused the dissociation of the oligomer.
Furthermore, the oligomeric state could be disrupted by the addition
of Ca2+. Our results revealed the divergent structures
of MCU NTDs while suggesting the key residues of NTD in DdMCU channel
assembly.

Results
Structure Determination of the DdMCU-NTD
For the structural investigation of the NTD of DdMCU, we made five
constructs, all lacking the predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence
(residues 1–28), based on the secondary structure and signal
peptide prediction. These constructs include residues
29–126, 29–164, 29–164 with 88–106 removed
(29–164/Δ88–106), 29–164 with 92−106
removed (29–164/Δ92–106), and 29–164 with
93−106 removed and GGSGG added to the C-terminus (29–164/Δ93–106GGSGG),
respectively (Figure S2). The synthetic
dsDNAs of the constructs above were inserted into the pET21a vector
between the NdeI and XhoI restriction
enzyme sites for expression and, thus, all proteins have a 6×
His tag at the N terminus. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel affinity,
ion exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography. The construct containing
residues 29–126 showed the best homogeneity and stability and
was used for crystallization.

We were able to crystallize DdMCU-NTD
in a number of different conditions and in different forms. The best
crystals were cube-shaped crystals formed in the precipitant solution
containing 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, and 10 mM HEPES-NaOH
(pH 7.5). These crystals diffracted to 1.7 Å with the P 21 21 21 space group. Since
DdMCU-NTD has no sequence homology to any of the known structural
domains in the database, we used the selenomethionine (SeMet) single-wavelength
anomalous diffraction (SAD) method31 for
experimental phasing. DdMCU-NTD has only one methionine (Met) out
of 98 residues. To avoid the potential problem of having too few Met
sites for labeling, we introduced several methionine residues by mutagenesis,
including L8M, L54M, L86M, L71M/L67M, L8M/L20M, L8M/L86M, and L8M/L20M/L86M.
One of the mutants, L8M/L20M, successfully produced crystals with
the P1 21 1 space group that diffracted to
2.2 A°. SAD data collected with the crystals were used to obtain
the initial phase and to solve the SeMet mutant structure (Table 1). Four protomers
with two types of interactions were found in an asymmetric unit (Figure 1A), and all protomers
were complete based on the electron density. One protomer was used
as the search model to solve the wild-type structure by molecular
replacement. The structure of the wild-type DdMCU-NTD was subsequently
refined to 1.7 A° (Figure 1B) with Rwork/Rfree of 19.0/22.4% (Table 1). We focused our discussion on the P 21 21 21 structure because the protein was not mutated.

DdMCU-NTD Adopts a Helix-Rich Fold
Each protomer in the
DdMCU-NTD wild-type crystal contains four α-helices with two
helix–loop–helix motifs and a short antiparallel β-sheet
formed between segments of the two loops (Figure 2A). This is distinctly different from all
NTDs of the solved structures. The known structures are largely
composed of β-strands and adopt an ubiquitin-like fold as exemplified
by the HsMCU-NTD structure (Figure 2B). The NTDs of the four fungal homologues, MaMCU,
CyMCU, NcMCU, and NfMCU, show tertiary structural resemblance to HsMCU-NTD
with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) 1.5–2.0 Å determined
by Dali server in contrast to the low sequence identity/similarity
with HsMCU-NTD (Figure S3). Despite being
the fungal origin, DdMCU-NTD shares neither sequence (Figure S4) nor structure similarities with the
structure-known fungal homologues, suggesting divergent evolution.

DdMCU-NTD Forms a Stable Homo-Oligomer in Solution
Consistent
with various types of interprotomer interactions found in the crystal
structure, DdMCU-NTD was shown to form a higher-order oligomer in
solution. The size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) retention volume
suggested a molecular weight (MW) of ∼40 kDa, and more precise
analysis with SEC-coupled multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) suggested
an average MW of 53.7 kDa (Figure 3A), which is in close agreement with a 4- or 5-meric
complex (MW of the theoretical 4- or 5-mer is 46.8 and 58.5 kDa, respectively).
The higher-order oligomer of DdMCU-NTD is also supported by cross-linking
and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) results.
Cross-linking experiments were further performed using the amine-reactive
glutaraldehyde. Multiple bands with low migration rates were observed
on the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE gel for the glutaraldehyde-treated
sample, but not for the nontreated sample, suggesting a high-order
oligomerization state (Figure 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that DdMCU-NTD forms
an oligomer that is at least composed of four subunits. By contrast,
HsMCU-NTD forms mostly monomer and dimer in solution.23,24

weight, and the average MW of the elution peak of DdMCU-NTD is 53.7

for 2 min: 0, 0.0015, 0.015, and 0.15% (v/v). For comparison, the
protein was treated with 1% SDS first and then with 0.15% glutaraldehyde
(the last lane).

Key Interactions Driving
NTD Oligomerization in Solution
A dimer of dimer DdMCU-NTD
assembly was observed in the crystal unit that displays two types
of intermolecular associations, interface I and interface II (Figures 4 and S5). The PISA program identified interface I
mediated by the intermolecular interactions, including Q38-I88, Q38-Y111,
K43-E115, Q45-S85, and Q45-S87, in the P 21 21 21 wild-type crystal structure. For example,
the hydrogen bonds were formed between side chain Hε of Q38
from one protomer with Ile88 backbone carbonyl and Tyr111 hydroxyl
from an adjacent protomer (Figure 4A). Other intermolecular hydrogen bonds were formed
between Q45 and S85, and between Q45 and S87 (Figure S5). The surface area of interface I is 379 Å2, calculated by CCP4. Interface II involves the intersubunit
interactions mainly between the polar side chains on α2 of one
subunit and α3 of a neighboring subunit. One pair of interactions
is identified between N59 side chain amine and N93 carbonyl, and between
D60 side chain carbonyl and N93 amine (Figures 4B and S5). Another
two pairs of the interactions in interface II are between E72 side
chain carbonyl and N76 amine (Figure 4C), and between K66 side chain amine and E74 carbonyl
(Figure S5). The surface area of interface
II is 82.55 Å2. A dimerization interface is also observed
in the crystal structure of HsMCU-NTD,23 but due to the low sequence identity and structural assembly, the
dimerization interfaces I and II of DdMCU-NTD are not conserved in
the crystal structure of HsMCU-NTD.

200 column (GE Healthcare) in 75 mM NaCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5).

To gain more insights into the interactions that mediate oligomerization
in solution, we examined the two types of interfaces (Figure S5) in the crystal structures by mutagenesis.
We introduced the single mutation Q38A and the double mutation S85A/S87A
in the interface I and the single mutations D60A and N93A and double
mutation D60A/N93A in the interface II to disrupt the NTD interactions.
Unexpectedly, though interface I shows more tight interactions than
interface II, size-exclusion chromatography and SEC-MALS showed that
neither mutations in the interface I disrupted DdMCU-NTD oligomerization
in the solution (Figures 4D and S6). While SEC-MALS analysis
of the D60A and N93A mutants showed apparent MW of 33.8 and 25.7 kDa,
respectively, the double mutant D60A/N93A showed the greatest size
reduction to 19.0 kDa (Figures 4E and S6). We found that substituting
the acidic side chains of E72 and E74 also altered the oligomerization
pattern (Figure 4F),
i.e., single mutations E72A and E74A reduced the apparent MW of the
solution complex to 42.5 and 39.8 kDa, respectively (Figure S6). All of the mutated proteins were eluted as a single
major peak on a Superdex 200 10/300 column with a relatively broad
peak width, except for D60A. The apparent molecular weights of the
mutants ranged from ∼19 to ∼42.5 kDa, equaling to 1.6–3.6
times the theoretical 11.7 kDa monomer weight (Table 2), suggesting the existence of monomer–dimer,
dimer–trimer, and trimer–tetramer equilibrium in fast
exchange, respectively. Notably, mutating E71, which is spatially
close to E72 and E74, did not cause any significant decrease in size,
suggesting that the observed interface sites containing E72 and E74
are specific (Figure S6). These results
suggested that the interface II observed in the crystal structure
mediated NTD oligomerization in solution.

Calcium Disrupts DdMCU-NTD Oligomer in Solution
A previous study of HsMCU-NTD showed that Ca2+ or Mg2+ could destabilize HsMCU-NTD oligomerization and shift the
self-association equilibrium to monomer.24 We found a similar Ca2+ response for DdMCU-NTD. In the
presence of 50 mM Ca2+, the DdMCU-NTD oligomers reduced
to an apparent MW of 20.2 kDa in MALS (Figure 5A) and 22 kDa in dynamic light scattering
(DLS) analysis (Figure 5B). A control experiment using K+ showed no obvious effect
on DdMCU-NTD oligomerization (Figure S7), suggesting that the Ca2+-induced dissociation of the
DdMCU-NTD oligomers is specific to divalent cations.

of 50 mM Ca2+. (C) Blue Native-PAGE gel of DdMCU-NTD WT
and mutants in the absence or presence of Ca2+. The samples
were loaded to a NativePAGE 4–16% Bis–Tris Gel.

Next, we probed the oligomerization state of DdMCU-NTD
using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), which
allows complexes to mostly maintain their stoichiometry. DdMCU-NTD
WT mainly migrated at a molecular weight of ∼60 kDa (Figure 5C), which supported
a higher-order oligomeric state of the 5-/6-mer complex. The addition
of calcium disrupts the oligomerization, and one band at ∼20
kDa was observed. Two mutants (Q38A and S85A/S87A) that did not show
size changes in the SEC and two mutants (D60A and D60A/N93A) that
have obvious size differences from WT in the SEC were also analyzed
by blue native gel in the absence and presence of calcium. D60A/N93A
showed a band at ∼20 kDa with or without calcium, while the
other three mutants showed a major band at ∼60 kDa and a minor
band at ∼20 kDa in the absence of calcium and a major band
at ∼20 kDa in the presence of calcium. This indicates that
DdMCU-NTD may exist mainly as a dimer when it is dissociated by calcium
addition or mutations.

Discussion
As indicated from the
sequence alignment, the DdMCU has a higher sequence similarity in
NTD-less (127–275) domain than the NTD (Figure S4) with other homologues. The transmembrane pore formed
by the TM helices contains the Ca2+ selectivity motif (DxxE).
The conserved pore architecture reflects the ability of MCUs to mediate
Ca2+ flux in a selective manner. Here, we found that one
major difference is the conformation of the NTD, whereas HsMCU-NTD
adopts a β-grasp-like fold with 26% β strands and 16%
α helices, DdMCU-NTD has a helix-rich structure with 55% α
helices and 7% β strands. In addition to the crystal structure
of DdMCU-NTD being different from that of HsMCU-NTD, the oligomerization
of DdMCU-NTD in solution is also different from what was observed
in HsMCU-NTD. While the crystal structure showed both dimeric and
tetrameric assembly, the DdMCU-NTD in solution showed higher-order
oligomeric states when cross-linked. Native PAGE and SEC results also
showed that DdMCU-NTD formed a 4- to 6-meric state. Because of the
relatively low molecular weight of DdMCU-NTD, and the modest accuracy
of the abovementioned methods in probing oligomerization states, it
is currently difficult to define the exact oligomeric state. Based
on the known oligomeric states for the full-length protein from other
homologues, it is likely that DdMCU-NTD forms a tetramer in solution.
Although the oligomerization state of DdMCU-NTD is not definitive,
it is clear that DdMCU-NTD can self-assemble into a high-order oligomer
in solution, while HsMCU-NTD did not show evidence of a stable oligomeric
assembly; it instead exhibited monomer–dimer equilibrium in
fast exchange.24 We have independently
confirmed by SEC and DLS that HsMCU-NTD in solution is predominantly
dimeric (Figure S8). Based on these results,
we conclude that DdMCU-NTD has a different self-association state
from HsMCU-NTD.

The recently published structures of the whole
fungal MCUs show that MCUs form a well-packed tetrameric ring, while
the NTDs are in a dimer of dimer assembly with two-fold symmetry.25−28 Two interfaces have been identified in these NTDs. The interfaces
are stabilized by similar intersubunit interactions, including hydrogen
bonding between polar side chains and a conserved salt bridge between
a Lys side-chain atoms of one subunit and an Asp side-chain atoms
of a neighboring subunit (Figure S9). Such
polar interactions are also observed in the crystal structures of
the HsMCU-NTD.23 Apart from the interfaces
within one MCU channel, extensive dimerization interactions at the
NTD were observed in the cryo-EM structure of the MCU–EMRE
complex that multiple sets of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds form
the v-shaped dimerization interface between two MCU tetramers.29 Mutating the key electrostatic interactions
abolished the dimerization of HsMCU but no alteration on the calcium
uptake.29 In DdMCU-NTD crystal structures,
two interfaces are identified, including interface I containing Q38-I88/Y111,
K43-E115, and Q45-S85/S87 three pairs of polar interactions, and interface
II, including N59/D60-N93, K66-D74, and E72-N76. Surprisingly, mutations
in the interface I that show tighter and larger contacting surface
did not disrupt oligomerization, while mutations in the interface
II play an important role in the formation and stabilization of the
DdMCU-NTD oligomers. Disruption of either pair of the polar interactions
in interface II by point mutations dramatically decreased the size
of DdMCU-NTD. It is possible that K43-E115 in the interface I might
be an essential interaction in the interface I or multiple-site mutations
are required to disrupt the interactions in interface I. Future experimentation
are required to explore these possibilities and depict the DdMCU-NTD
assembly. Nevertheless, instead of the sequence and structure diversities,
the oligomeric polar interfaces observed in different NTDs may play
a role in maintaining the architectural integrity of the uniporter.

According to the discovery of Lee et al., the disruption of the
MCU-regulating acidic patch (MRAP) of HsMCU-NTD by Ca2+ or Mg2+ could weaken the oligomer assembly of the NTD
and promote the NTD monomerization.24 It
is likely that Ca2+ exits from the membrane-proximal chamber
after passing through the TM pore. In this case, the local concentration
of Ca2+ in the chamber is estimated at the millimolar level.
The observation led to a model in which the NTD of HsMCU plays an
important Ca2+-dependent regulatory role.24 We also found that Ca2+ has the ability to disrupt the
self-association equilibrium of DdMCU-NTD in solution, probably to
a dimer instead of a monomer according to the analysis of the native
gel. The structural observation that α4 helix is highly exposed
in the subunit structure also indicates that the monomer may not be
stable in the solution. Similar Ca2+-induced NTD dissociation
has been observed for DdMCU and HsMCU, despite the large structural
differences in the NTD, suggesting that the NTD may play a regulatory
role in the Ca2+ conductance of MCU.

In conclusion,
we have shown that the NTD of DdMCU adopts a fold that is completely
different from the NTD of other MCU homologues. We have also shown
that the DdMCU-NTD is capable of forming oligomers in solution, and
such oligomerization appears to be mediated by intermolecular electrostatic
interactions involving several acidic residues. The binding of calcium
can disrupt the DdMCU-NTD oligomers. Although the functional role
of the NTD in DdMCU remains to be investigated, our results provide
structural insights into the NTD in the DdMCU channel assembly and
the basis of calcium permeation.

Materials and Methods
Protein
Expression and Purification
The D. discoideum MCU N-terminal domain (DdMCU-NTD) was cloned into the vector pET21a
with a hexahistidine (6× His) at the N terminus. The plasmid
was then transformed into E. coli BL21
(DE3) and cultured in the Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C
until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.7.
The expression of DdMCU-NTD was induced by the addition of 0.15 mM
IPTG, followed by incubation at 18 °C for 12 h.

The bacteria
were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (200
mM NaCl, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0)). After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 39 000g for 40 min. Then, the supernatant was passed through a
Ni-NTA affinity column, washed, and eluted with elution buffer (200
mM NaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 400 mM imidazole, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH
8.0)). The imidazole was removed by dialyzing the sample against 15
mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5). The protein
was then applied to a HiTrap-Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), and eluted
with a linear gradient to 1 M NaCl in 30 min. The protein was further
purified using a HiLoad16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with size-exclusion chromatography buffer (75 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 20
mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5)). The pooled fractions were concentrated to
20 mg/mL for crystallization. All of the mutants were purified following
the same protocol.

For crystal structure determination, selenomethionyl
(SeMet) DdMCU-NTD was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells grown in M9 medium supplemented with SeMet, as
described previously.32 The SeMet-labeled
mutant (L8M/L20M) was then produced by following the same purification
protocol used for the wild-type protein.

Crystallization and Data
Collection
The DdMCU-NTD protein (20 mg/mL in 75 mM NaCl,
5 mM DTT, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5)) was crystallized using the sitting
drop vapor diffusion method with a reservoir solution of 20% (w/v)
PEG 4000, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5). Ca2+ was not added to the crystallization buffer, and no ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) was added either to sequester residual Ca2+ constitutively present in water. Crystals were grown for 3–5
weeks at 4 °C by mixing equal volumes (0.5 μL) of protein
and reservoir solution in MRC 2 drop 96-well crystallization plate
(Swissci, Neuheim, Switzerland) and cryo-cooled in a cryoprotectant
consisting of the reservoir solution supplemented with 35% (v/v) ethylene
glycol. The SeMet crystals were produced in the same conditions used
for the wild-type protein, with the exception that 8 mg/mL SeMet protein
was used for crystallization. The SeMet crystals were flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen with the same cryoprotective reagents. X-ray diffraction
data were collected at the BL18U beamline in the Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility (SSRF). Diffraction data were processed using the
XDS package.33−35 Data collection statistics are shown in Table 1.

Structure Determination
and Refinement
The structure was solved using Phenix.autosol
with the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data collected using
the SeMet-labeled L8M/L20M mutant. An initial model was built using
Phenix.autobild.36 The structure was completed
using alternate cycles of manual fitting in Coot37 followed by structure refinement with Phenix.refine. Detailed
data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.

SEC-MALS Analysis
of the DdMCU-NTD Molecular Weight
Molecular weight determination
by gel filtration was carried out by comparing the gel phase distribution
coefficient (Kav) of DdMCU-NTD with the values obtained from several
known calibration standards, including ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase
(158 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and lysozyme (14
kDa). The equation derived from the calibration curve between the
elution volume parameters of known proteins and the logarithm of their
molecular weights (plot of Kav versus log MW) is  The instrument
setup used for the SEC-MALS experiment consisted of an Agilent 1260
Infinity Isocratic liquid chromatography system connected in tandem
with a Wyatt Dawn Heleos II multiangle light scattering (MALS) detector
(Wyatt Technology), a Wyatt Optilab T-rEX refractive index detector
(Wyatt Technology), and a ViscoStar III differential viscometer (Wyatt
Technology). Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed
at room temperature using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with a mobile phase containing 75 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM NaN3, 50 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.4). One hundred microliters purified
DdMCU-NTD sample at 10 mg/mL were injected into the column and eluted
at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The column effluent was monitored in-line
with three detectors that simultaneously monitored UV absorption,
light scattering, and refractive index. The data from the three detectors
were imported by the ASTRA software package, and the three-detector
method38 was used to determine the molecular
weight.

Dynamic Light Scattering
Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
measurements were performed at 25 °C for DdMCU-NTD and HsMCU-NTD
on a DynaPro NanoStar instrument (Wyatt) with water or buffer alone
as controls. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a positive control
to ensure that the instrument is performing as expected. Then, 100
μL of 0.1 mM DdMCU-NTD and HsMCU-NTD samples were loaded to
obtain the hydrodynamic radius and the size distribution. Protein
and particle sizes were then analyzed using the Rayleigh sphere model
with the method of regularization by Dynamics V6 software accompanied
by the instrument. Size distributions were reported as intensity distributions
and the average radius was reported in terms of polydispersity.

Characterization of the DdMCU-NTD Oligomeric State
The oligomeric
state of DdMCU-NTD was first examined by chemical cross-linking using
glutaraldehyde (Sigma). The reaction volume of 50 μL consisted
of 0.5 mg/mL protein, 25 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and
various concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0.0015, 0.015, and 0.15%,
v/v). The reaction was stopped after 2 min by adding 100 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0). The samples were incubated for another 5 min. The reaction
mixtures were analyzed using SDS-PAGE gel. Blue native gradient gel
was generated with a NativePAGE 4–16% Bis–Tris Gel (Invitrogen,
16041980). Two micrograms of DdMCU-NTD (in the absence and presence
of 20 mM CaCl2) was mixed with NativePAGE sample buffer
and G-250 additive (Invitrogen), then analyzed by blue native gel.
The electrophoresis was performed at 150 V in 1× NativePAGE anode
buffer and 1× NativePAGE cathode buffer A for 70 min. The NativeMark
unstained protein standard (Invitrogen #LC0725) was used as a reference
marker.
