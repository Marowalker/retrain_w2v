The quest for concepts of isostructurality
in organic crystals
has been long and mostly based on geometric data, even with the development
of modern software. This field of study is of great interest to the
pharmaceutical industry and for the prediction of crystal structures.
Despite this, there is still no methodology that provides broad quantitative
and comparable similarity data between two complete crystalline structures.
The present study demonstrated that the similarity between two crystalline
structures could be estimated from the similarity between the two
“supramolecular clusters”. Quantitative indexes for
similarity comparisons of crystal structures were shown using nine
5-aryl-1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-pyrazoles as a model.
This proposal includes the quantitative data of a geometric parameter
(ID), a contact area parameter (IC), and an energetic parameter (IG). The proposed indexes exhibited good perspective regarding
the similarity data and distinct regions of similarity. The range
of similarity was set at IX ≥ 0.80,
0.80 > IX > 0.60, and IX ≤ 0.60 (X = D, C, or G). Indexes with a value
near 1.0 indicate systems with isostructural, isocontact, and isoenergetic
behavior. The results indicated that supramolecular structures with
high similarity must have high values for all three indexes (ID, IC, and IG).

==== Body
1 Introduction
For
many years, crystallographers have identified motifs in crystal
structures and compared these to one known structure, which is important
to understand to achieve certain applications, such as in the study
of polymorphic forms,1 cocrystals,2 or molecules that may have pharmaceutical activities.3 The field of structure prediction may also benefit
with superior tools for supramolecular comparison and guide in designing
new crystals. An improved understanding of isostructurality phenomenon
can result in the design of similar structures, depending on the geometry
and shape of the known structures.4−7 Different substituents may be changed in
the desired molecule without substantially changing the crystal lattice.

In the pursuit for isostructurality, Kitaigorodskii (1961)8 stated that “isomorphism in organic crystals
has some important features which force us to consider this vital
topic from a viewpoint different from that for inorganic compounds”.8 Three decades later, Kálmán et
al. (1993)9 referred to isostructurality
as the similarity of spatial arrangements in crystalline structures.
The phenomenon was interpreted three-dimensionally (isostructurality
involving the whole crystal) and also observed one- and two-dimensionally.
In this manner, the International Union of Crystallography states
that “two crystals are said to be isostructural if they have
the same structure but not necessarily the same cell dimensions nor
the same chemical composition...”.10 It is noteworthy that the two aforementioned concepts only consider
the geometric parameter to compare complete structures.

The
studies by Kálmán et al.9,11,12 resulted in the first articulation with
the phenomenon, and the authors recommended the use of two main descriptors:
the unit-cell similarity index and the isostructurality index (Ii). Therefore, the Ii is obtained after full or partial least-squares fitting of the raw
data, which was considered to be a direct measurement of the degree
of approximate isostructurality between both molecules. Because of
this, the authors recommended the classification of several types
of supramolecular structures.9

Moreover,
Fábián and Kálmán (1999)13 indicated some limitations of the isostructurality
index (Ii) and proposed a new volumetric
isostructurality index (Iv) to overcome
these restrictions. The authors suggest that the volumes occupied
in the unit cell should be closely related in isostructural pairs.
In this context, the application of extremely complicated formulae
is necessary to obtain the data and a numerical algorithm to calculate Iv and compare structures of different space
groups is necessary to transform both into a space group with lower
symmetry.

Gelbrich and Hursthouse (2005)14 described
a method based on data from the XPac software that identifies similar
supramolecular constructs (SCs), which are subcomponents of a complete
crystal structure (0, 1, or 2 dimensionalities). This method can also
identify 3D similarity in isostructural assemblies in different crystal
structures. In the following year, the same authors used the SC concept
to compare 25 related crystal structures and demonstrated that the
XPac method is a suitable tool for investigating large sets of related
crystal structures.3 In 2012, the XPac
was used in a large study of 14 structures of benzenesulfonamide-2-pyridines,
which showed isostructurality of 1D (molecular chains), 2D (layers),
and 3D, thus yielding the dissimilarity index (x).15

The parameters derived from the XPac program
can be useful in establishing
limits of isostructurality in polymorphs, which was showed by Coles
(2014)16 in the comparison of two forms
of 3-chloromandelic acid. In the same year, the authors17 also studied 27 monosubstituted mandelic acids
and reported their degree of similarity and how all the structures
are related.

More recently, the isostructurality of different
crystalline forms
in terms of nature and energy of the equivalent supramolecular building
blocks associated with the presence of various intermolecular interactions
in crystal packing has been studied by Dey et al.1,18 The
similarities have been investigated via XPac, two-dimensional Hirshfeld
fingerprint,19 and energy framework analysis.20,21 These authors demonstrated the “energy framework analysis”
with the purpose of indicating in the qualitative form 3D structural
similarities in the interactions of studied crystalline forms. In
addition, an average was presented between the net cluster energies
to show the similarity between the systems.

From the emergence
of the concept of isostructurality over 20 years
ago up until recent studies, two main issues have been observed. First,
most of the comparison studies are based on geometric data—pairs
of molecules and/or fragments to compare systems—mainly with
software such as XPac15 and Mercury,22 which generally provide quantitative isostructurality
derived from absolute geometric data without any normalization. Although
quantitative, these data do not enable an extension of the conclusions
to different series of crystalline structures with important topological
differences. On the basis of these observations, there is a lack of
quantitative boundaries between high-similarity and low-similarity
systems in organic crystals.

Recently, we proposed an approach
for better understanding the
crystallization phenomenon, which considers the topological and energetic
properties of a crystal, explored as a lattice that grows from a supramolecular
cluster.23−28 Therefore, using this concept, we proposed a model that may lead
to further understanding the similarity between crystal structures
and enable classification in different ranges of similarity. The focus
of previous analyses, such as XPac, is finding similar substructures,
whereas the focus of this study is to compare complete structures.
It is important to note that the goal is not to redefine the concept
of isostructurality, which is defined as a geometric similarity, but
to provide a tool able to identify similarities between complete structures
using the geometric parameter along with other two parameters to observe
similarity in a broad perception.

Similarity indexes using contact
area, geometrical, and energetic
parameters were considered for the first time. To achieve this purpose,
a series of nine 5-aryl-1-tert-butylpyrazoles (1–9)29 was used as the study
model (Figure 1).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Supramolecular
Cluster
By using the
supramolecular cluster,23 we considered
that the similarity of two crystalline structures, which are called
A and B, can be estimated from the similarity between the two supramolecular
clusters. This comparison can be done for molecules from a series
with different substituents or polymorphs. The spatial arrangement
of molecules in a cluster can be described with internal coordinates
(symmetry codes). Thus, the clusters of two different crystal structures
containing molecules of a similar shape and size are immediately comparable.
This can be applied regardless of the crystal system, space group,
or number of crystallographically independent molecules (Z′). A representation of the supramolecular cluster in the
infinite crystal lattice can be seen in Figure 2 using compound 1 as an example.
This representation can elucidate the main proposal of this study,
which was how to obtain a final value of similarity between two crystalline
structures. Current studies search for similarities in different organic
crystals using systems that do not represent the whole crystal by
comparing different portion sizes (unit cell, fragments or subclusters).
In our approach, the comparisons are made with the whole supramolecular
cluster (3D)—which has all the necessary information to obtain
the similarity between systems—without neglecting molecules
that are important for the differences between systems. We believe
that it is only possible to assess similarities/differences by considering
the 3D portion, because 1D or 2D fragments do not represent all the
necessary information for a complete comparison of the crystal network.

using compound 1 as an example.

From the supramolecular cluster, which was grown from the
neighboring
molecules around the reference molecule M1, the dimers that give us
the contact area, geometric, and energetic information of the crystal
structure were obtained. The neighboring molecules represent the molecular
coordination number (MCN). These dimers are represented by the interaction
between the monomers (molecules) M1 and MN (M1···M2,
M1···M3, ..., M1···M15). All of the
monomers that share surface contact area with the reference molecule
M1 are considered part of the cluster. The supramolecular cluster
and surface contact area were obtained using Voronoi–Dirichlet
Polyhedra (VDP) by means of the ToposPro 4.0 software.30

2.2 Similarity Indexes
This proposal
includes quantitative data for a geometric parameter (ID), a contact area parameter (IC), and an energetic parameter (IG). Data
within the considered dimer of the supramolecular cluster were used
for all indexes, which were the values between the monomers that form
the dimer. The data were then correlated with the data of the equivalent
dimer of the compared cluster. We considered that the two equal supramolecular
clusters A and B should have a theoretical value of 1.0, and when
comparing “real” systems, the deviation of similarity
should be considered to discount from the ideal 1.0, and therefore,
the root mean square error (RMSE) calculation was used. Our residual
data are the difference between the actual values and the predicted
ones, with the RMSE as a measure of the spread of the y values about the predicted y value.

Normalized
data were used instead of raw data because the proposal aims to compare
systems with different N molecules in the cluster
by using as raw data the atom–atom distances, surface areas,
and stabilization energy that are distinct in different N molecules.
Therefore, normalization is indispensable when comparing similarity
in different systems. The use of raw data is one of the restrictions
observed in other methods to provide not only quantitative but also
comparable values. To understand the normalization process,23,28 we can think in terms of an ideal symmetric system, where all the N molecules in the cluster should have the same contribution.
For example, in a cluster with an MCN of 14, all dimers must have
a contribution of 1/14 for all parameters considered (e.g., energy).
However, this is far from the reality of most organic molecules, where
distinct interactions occur leading to different dimeric contributions.
The proposal needs to reduce all raw data to the same metric (scale)
using the MCN as the reference for this normalization.

The geometric
index of similarity uses the atom–atom distances
within the considered dimer (formed by the interaction between the
M1 and MN molecules of cluster A), i.e., atom–atom
distance between the monomers of the dimer. Those distances are then
correlated with the data of the equivalent dimer from cluster B. Geometric
data normalization is in relation with the value obtained by i = m × N, where
“m” is the number of atom–atom
distances between the monomers of the considered dimer in the calculations
and N is the number of molecules that form the cluster,
i.e., around the reference molecule M1. From this point and for clarity
purposes, the number of neighboring molecules from the MCN is named
N. Eq 1 is used to obtain
the normalization of the raw distance of the dimer. 1  

In eq 2, the ID value shows a geometric similarity between
two supramolecular clusters A and B, where NDi is the normalized atom–atom distance between the monomers
of the considered dimer that is formed between molecule M1 and molecule
MN of cluster A. NDpredict is the normalized
atom–atom distance of the dimer formed between molecule M1
and MN, which is from cluster A, predicted from a
linear equation of the normalized atom–atom distances of the
dimeric equivalents of cluster B (see Supporting Information, section S1 for further information). A unique
linear correlation must be performed in each cluster comparison. 2  

For the
contact area and stabilization energy parameters, raw data
corresponding to the contact area (CM1···MN) and energy (GM1···MN) within the considered dimer, i.e., between the
monomers of the dimer, are normalized in relation with the N molecules of the cluster, following eqs 3 and 4, respectively. 3   4  

Eqs 5 and 6 show the contact area index (IC) and energetic index (IG) between
clusters A and B, respectively. 5   6  

In eqs 5 and 6, both the NCM1···MN—which
is the normalized contact area—and the
NGM1···MN—which
is the normalized intermolecular interaction energy of a dimer—are
obtained between molecule M1 and a molecule MN of
cluster A. NCpredict and NGpredict are the normalized
contact area and the normalized stabilization energy, respectively,
in a dimer of cluster A, predicted from the data of the dimeric equivalents
of cluster B (see Supporting Information, section S1 for further information).

The steps of how to
obtain the proposed indexes, including the
normalization process, are demonstrated in the Supporting Information (section S1, Figures S1 and S2), where
the contact area index (IC) in the supramolecular
comparison between compound 3 (Cl) and 4 (Br) was used as an example. The indexes can be used for compounds
with Z′ = 1 as demonstrated in this study
and also for structures with Z′ > 1, where
different supramolecular clusters can be isolated within the crystal
structure, and in these cases, one cluster does not represent the
whole structure. In those cases, a supramolecular cluster must be
grown for each molecule present in the asymmetric unit, and comparisons
between all constructed clusters must be carried following the same
steps as structures with Z′ = 1.

The
similarity values for any proposed index (eqs 2, 5, 6, and 7) will be between 1 (maximum
similarity) and 0. Clearly, the theoretical minimum of Ix = 0 will never be obtained in a calculation because
there is always some resemblance, even between less similar structures.
The data from the proposed indexes are useful for comparing any supramolecular
cluster because we consider normalized data from the equivalent dimers,
that is, it is possible to evaluate several systems with different
MCNs in the same similarity range. To the best of our knowledge, no
quantitative data based on contact area and stabilization energy similarity
of the supramolecular clusters of organic crystals have been reported
in the literature.

2.3 Dissimilarity Index (x) and
Geometric Index of Similarity (ID)
To demonstrate the use of the similarity indexes, the 5-aryl-1-tert-butylpyrazoles (1–9) were used
as the study model. Initially, we performed a geometric approach.
The XPac software was used as an initial screening for the study,
only then those systems in which at least one dimension (1D) of similarity
was found were considered for further investigation, as there is no
reason to assess a degree of similarity for structures that do not
share any resemblance in any direction. Therefore, systems identified
as “0D supramolecular construct” or “no similarity”
were discarded. All nonhydrogen atoms common to all structures were
considered for the distance determination (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Common set of atoms (points) in the studied
molecule (indicated
by blue circles) used for the geometric index (ID) and the XPac analysis.

For all the indexes, the equivalent dimers were established
after
an overlay of the clusters (Supporting Information, Figures S26–S40). The overlay of the clusters was done by
considering the M1 molecule as the reference point. An overlay of
the M1 molecule was carried out by choosing common atoms between the
structures using the Mercury software. After the overlay of the reference
molecules, all the other equivalent molecules of the cluster can be
found. The geometric similarity data, which were obtained from the
XPac program and through the ID index, are shown in Table 1.

For the purpose of clarity, all
compared systems were referred
to as substituent “X” (Figure 1). In relation to compounds 1–4, the dissimilarity index (x) provided by the XPac
software was between 0.6 and 3.5, while our geometric similarity parameter
(ID) was between 0.993 and 0.945. For
these compounds, 14 neighboring molecules (N = 14),
which correspond to the supramolecular cluster, were considered to
be equivalent dimers.

An excellent correlation was observed
between the dissimilarity
index (x) and the parameter ID, for compounds 1–4, with a linear equation
of x = −57.45ID + 57.853, with r = 0.988 (Figure 4a). This result is expected, given that we
are considering very similar supramolecular structures with 3D isostructurality.

Figure 4 (a) Correlation
between the dissimilarity index (x) and the index ID (1–4), and (b) correlation
between the effective distance (Δdeff) and the index ID (1–4).

For the set of compounds (5–9) with N = 16, the ID index was between
0.717 and 0.945, while the dissimilarity index (x), which was provided by the XPac program, was between 1.3 and 10.0.
However, the “x” data, although quantitative,
do not follow an appropriate trend. In other words, the “x” values do not provide clear quantitative information
regarding the similarity of the compared structures. It is possible
to have systems of high similarity (3D) with values close to 10.0
and lower similarity values closer to 1.0, because the method considers
a different number of molecules in each example and thus do not allow
a range of comparison. The dissimilarity index does not follow an
appropriate trend of maximum and minimum. In our molecules when XPac
was used, lower dissimilarity values (x) were obtained
in systems with large differences between them (e.g., “I vs
NO2”, with x = 2.0). The same has
been observed in recent studies,18,31 in which high
dissimilarity values (up to 16.0) have been observed for 3D systems.
In the compounds 5–9, the number of neighboring
molecules considered by the software differs between 12 and 1, in
which the 16 molecules of the supramolecular cluster should be considered.
This expected difference in the N and x values occurs because it is considered only subunits for a systematic
comparison of the clusters.

The relationship between the ID data
and those of the dissimilarity index could not be provided for this
series of compounds (5–9) because we are dealing
with supramolecular comparisons for which XPac considers only the
portion of similarity in 1D and 2D of the cluster, and our method
considers the whole 3D portion. Our contribution is that we compare
the complete structure to provide a quantitative value for the compared
system while the XPac method seeks similar substructures.

A
correlation between the absolute differences of the effective
distance (Δdeff) associated with
each substituent, and the parameter ID for compounds 1–4 are shown in Figure 4b. Additional information regarding
the effective distance calculation can be seen in Supporting Information (Tables S8–S9). The Δdeff was already mentioned by Gelbrich et al.
(2012),15 in which good correlation with
the dissimilarity index was reported. The effective distance can explain
the geometric similarity between these systems with a high correlation
(r = 0.971), which is in accordance with Gelbrich
et al. (2012)15 (Figure 4b).

2.4 Contact Area (IC) and Energetic (IG) Indexes
The contact area and energetic approach was chosen to achieve the
two other indexes. First, VDP analysis was used to determine the contact
area between the M1 and MN molecules (CM1···MN) (see Supporting Information, Tables S10–S18). In the second step, the crystal energy
stability was determined based on the stabilization of the different
dimers formed between the M1 and the MN molecules
(see Supporting Information, Tables S10–S18).
Finally, eqs 5 and 6 were applied to our contact area and energetic data,
while taking into consideration the equivalent dimers. Quantitative
data regarding the comparison of several different supramolecular
structures were obtained, and the values for all indexes can be seen
in Table 2. A better
visualization of the data of the three similarity indexes (ID, IC, and IG) is presented in Figure 5.

area (IC), and energetic (IG) indexes for compounds 1–9.

The comparisons between compounds 1–4 and the
Me versus OMe system showed the parameters with the highest values
of similarity, with values ranging from around 0.80 to 0.99 for the
three main parameters (ID, IC, and IG). These data confirm
that these systems can be considered similar, thus demonstrating isostructural,
isocontact, and isoenergetic behavior (Figure 5). According to the XPac software, the aforementioned
comparisons have a 3D degree of similarity. The H versus Br, H versus
Cl, and H versus F systems had the following order of similarity for
the geometric and contact area parameters: F > Cl > Br. However,
the
energetic index (IG) had an inverse order.
In addition to the subtle difference between these systems (2.4–4.7%),
this kind of information shows that the energetic and contact area
parameters are crucial in defining the similarity between two crystalline
structures.

The systems with N = 16 had a lower
degree of
similarity and showed two other regions of similarity—one between
0.8 and 0.6 and the other below 0.6—when considered the contact
area and stabilization energy parameters. The Me versus NO2 and OMe versus NO2 systems had values in the intermediate
region between 0.80 and 0.60 for the contact area and stabilization
energy parameters—they have a 2D geometric similarity. However,
in this case, XPac indicated a 3D profile. Me versus I and OMe versus I also present values within this
intermediate region for the IC and IG.

The geometric data show a relatively
high value (around 0.7), even
in the less similar systems, which can mislead the interpretation
of similarity when only this parameter is considered. Therefore, for
a system to be considered similar, it must have high similarity values
(>0.80) for all three indexes (ID, IC, and IG), because
we should see the similarity as a balance between the three parameters
(Figure 5). In the
cases where only the geometric parameter has higher values than the
other two parameters (IC and IG), one should consider this comparison with a lower degree
of similarity.

The comparisons with lower similarity involve
the Pz structure,
which can be observed in the low values of IC and IG. The comparisons Pz versus
Me and Pz versus OMe showed a unique behavior where the IC exhibited almost twice the values of the IG, which demonstrates that in these systems
there is no direct relationship between area and energy. Therefore,
these systems have fewer similarities in contact area but an even
less similarity regarding the intermolecular interactions, which results
in more distinct stabilization energies (Figure 5).

Because of being in agreement with
what was suggested by Kálmán
et al. (1991),11 we can establish that
there is a similarity range, in which IX ≥ 0.80, 0.80 > IX > 0.60,
and IX ≤ 0.60 (X = D, C, or G)
are considered
to be high, mean, and low values, respectively. The contact area and
energetic parameters clearly lead us to a final value that corroborates
with what is visually observed (qualitative analysis) in the cluster
overlay. Thus, the interpretation using the different indexes shows
good perspective in relation to the similarity data, with distinct
regions of similarity, especially when using the contact area and
stabilization energy parameters. The three main indexes present physical
meaning for the understanding of the crystal packing. The contact
area and energetic indexes present information regarding the complementarity
of surfaces and stabilization energies between molecules, respectively.
The use of the three distinct parameters allows a complete comprehension
of system similarity.

Additionally, a multiparameter similarity
index (Imp) can be composed between more
than one parameter between
two supramolecular clusters (A and B). The Imp drags the inheritance of the similarity in different parameters
to provide a holistic understanding of the comparison. The multiparameter
index can be obtained following eq 7, in which n is the number of parameters
considered. When the three parameters (X = D, C, and G) shown in eqs 2, 5 and 6 are considered, the multiparameter index
will be named IDCG. 7  

The multiparameter index can be adapted according to the desired
study. In a study regarding the relation only between the contact
area and stabilization energy parameter, it is possible to obtain
the ICG. The furnished value in the multiparameter
index (Table S7) corroborates with what
is visually observed (qualitative analysis) in the cluster overlay.
The overview of all IDCG data, with the
three distinct regions of similarity, is presented in Figure S3.

The multiparameter index can
yield the contribution of each parameter
(each distinct physical meaning) in a series of compounds. Applying
a multiple linear regression fit to the contribution of each parameter
to the IDCG similarity index allows us
to observe which parameter is more relevant to the similarity of the
studied systems. This multiple linear correlation provided the following: IDCG = 0.434IG +
0.339IC + 0.170ID + 0.052. From this correlation, it is possible to acquire
important information regarding the high contribution of the energetic
parameter (47%) to the final similarity value, followed by the contact
area index (35%). The geometric index contributes with around 18%
of the final value of IDCG. This multiple
correlation provides some final information that corroborates with
the previous data presented, where the geometric parameter alone does
not provide reliable data regarding similarity because even in less
similar systems a high value of geometric similarity can be observed
(ID). The correlation shows for the studied
compounds that the energetic and contact area parameters are more
sensitive to differences between the systems.

2.5 Dimers
Contribution—ΔNparameter
The indexes
(Iindex) of each
comparison were correlated with the absolute average of the normalized
data between the equivalents dimers considered in the clusters (ΔNparameter). Eq 8 obtained the absolute average of the normalized data from each dimer
considered in the clusters (ΔNparameter). 8  

In eq 8, AN and BN are the normalized
data from the dimer of cluster A and the normalized data from the
equivalent dimer of cluster B, respectively. Here, “m” is the number of data considered in each dimer.
For the geometric parameter, where the atom–atom distances
of each dimer are used, “m” is equal
to the number of distances considered. For the contact area and energetic
parameters, “m” is equal to 1 because
each dimer will always have only one data regarding topology and energy.

The ΔNparameter can be ΔNd, ΔNC, or ΔNG, using the distance, contact area,
and energy data, respectively. This approach assists in observing
the different degrees of similarity between the supramolecular structures
studied (Figure 6).
In addition, there was an excellent view of dimer influence on the
similarity index of the cluster.

Figure 6 Correlation between the similarity parameters—ID (a), IC (b), and IG (c)—and the differences in intermolecular
distances (ΔNd), surface contact area (ΔNC), and energy (ΔNG), respectively, of the
equivalent dimers of the supramolecular clusters A and B of compounds 1–9.

The correlation in Figure 6a shows the distinct
isostructurality region (3D) close to
the origin for compounds 1–4 and the “Me
versus OMe” system. Moving away from the origin, there is less
similarity for the geometric parameter (ID)—which has 1D and 2D systems—and, consequently, there
is an increase in the absolute value of ΔNd. The
same tendency is observed for the geometric parameter (Figure 6a), with isocontact and isoenergetic
crystal structures close to the origin demonstrated in Figure 6b,c. Nevertheless, their data
are more distributed than in Figure 6a with only subtle differences in the position between
them. This correlation allows us to observe the importance of data
traceability from each dimer that were used to achieve the final indexes
of similarity.

Correlations were made between the proposed indexes
and several
parameters in the search for variables that have an influence on the
similarity phenomenon. Some of the parameters used were related to
the substituent (e.g., the Hammet substituent effect and electronegativity),
while others were related to the molecule (e.g., melting enthalpy
and sublimation enthalpy). Parameters related to the unit cell (e.g.,
crystal packing efficiency—CPE27) and to the cluster (e.g., the total cluster surface contact area,
energy, energy per area, volume, surface, globularity, and asphericity
(Ω)) were also correlated. Correlations were done with all the
indexes (ID, IC, IG, and IDCG), and the absolute difference was determined between the values
of the parameters considered from each compared cluster. No significant
correlation was found (i.e., r > 0.700) in most
comparisons;
however, a significant trend was identified when the CPE and the Ω
were considered.

Asphericity is a measure of the anisotropy
of an object, in which
values around 0.0, 0.25, and 1.0 correspond to isotropic objects (spherical),
prolate objects (cigar-shaped), and oblate objects (disk-shaped),
respectively. The cluster asphericity (Ωcluster)
was obtained directly from the data provided by the software CrystalExplorer32 through the Hirshfeld surface. In the cell,
void volume determination was used with an isovalue of 0.0020 a.u.
using the software CrystalExplorer.32 The
asphericity of the cluster was considered instead of the molecule
because our indexes are based on the cluster and not on the individual
molecule. For the CPE, it was necessary to use data from the unit
cell and to compare with our indexes because there is no tool that
allows us to obtain the total volume and void volume of the supramolecular
cluster. The correlations between the CPE and asphericity, and the
similarity indexes are shown in Figures S21 and S22, respectively. The ΔCPE (Supporting Information, Figure S21) and the ΔΩcluster (Supporting Information, Figure S22)
correlations had r values ranging from 0.718 to 0.792
and 0.740 to 0.814, respectively. These correlations showed that the
CPE, and especially the asphericity of the supramolecular cluster,
could be related to the similarity of the organic crystal systems.

3 Conclusions
There is a lack of additional
parameters in the investigation of
packing comparisons in molecular organic crystals in the crystal engineering.
The demarcation issue related to the size of the system studied is
the starting point of the problem in packing similarity studies. This
study showed that the supramolecular cluster could be an alternative
for comparisons between complete structures. For the first time, geometric,
contact area, and energetic parameters were considered for proposing
indexes to assess the understanding of the packing similarity of complete
crystal structures. Here, a comparison between two crystal structures
to be considered similar must have an isostructural (geometric parameter),
isocontact (contact area parameter), and isoenergetic (stabilization
energy parameter) behavior. We believe that any similarity comparison
tool must consider these three parameters to achieve a consistent
and coherent result. A similarity range with distinct regions of similarity
was established, in which IX ≥
0.80, 0.80 > IX > 0.60, and IX ≤ 0.60 (X = D, C or G) are considered
to be high,
mean, and low values, respectively. The multiparameter index was shown
to be a quantitative index to assess the understanding of the contribution
of each considered parameter. We expect these indexes to contribute
as a new tool to assess future studies regarding the comparison of
crystalline systems.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 XPac Analysis
All measurements were
carried out using the XPac 2.0 software using default values and filter
settings of 10, 14, and 1.50, for the angular deviation (a), interplanar angular deviation (p), and corresponding
molecular centroid distance deviation (d), respectively.
All the results are presented in the Supporting Information (Figures S4–S19).

4.2 Contact
Area Analysis
VDP was used
in the ToposPro30,33 software for the construction
of the supramolecular cluster. The MCN found for each cluster in compounds 1–4 and 5–9 was 14 and 16, respectively.
The face of the molecular VDP was considered a set of atomic VDP faces
corresponding to the adjacent contacts between the atoms of two molecules.
From this, we established that the area of the face of a VDP corresponds
to M1···MN interactions, and the considered
parameter granted by the software was the area (in Å2) in contact between the monomers of the considered dimer.34

4.3 Stabilization Energy Calculation
The intermolecular interaction energies of the dimers from the
supramolecular
clusters of compounds 1–9 were determined by single-point
calculations performed with geometries obtained from X-ray diffraction.
The optimization of the molecular geometry was not performed. Density
functional theory at the ωB97X-D/cc-pVDZ level of theory, with
basis set superposition error (BSSE) correction, was used for the
calculation. The calculation for compound 5 was done
with ωB97X-D/cc-pVDZ-PP, because it is necessary to correct
relativistic effects of the iodine atom. All calculations were performed
with the aid of the Gaussian 09 software package.35 The counterpoise method of Boys and Bernardi (1970)36 was employed to minimize the BSSE. The stabilization
energy for M1···MN was obtained by
the energy values of the considered dimer minus the sum of the monomer
energies of M1 and MN.

4.4 Single
Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Diffraction measurements of compounds 1–4 and 6 were performed using graphite
monochromatized Mo Kα
radiation with λ = 0.71073 Å, on a Bruker SMART APEX II
diffractometer with a charge-coupled device detector. The diffraction
measurements of compound 7 were carried out using Cu
Kα radiation with λ = 1.54080 Å on a Bruker D8 QUEST
diffractometer, with a KAPPA four-circle goniometer, equipped with
a PHOTON II CPAD area detector. Anisotropic displacement parameters
for nonhydrogen atoms were applied. Integration, scaling correction,
and data reduction were performed using Bruker APEX-II. Absorption
corrections were performed using Gaussian and multiscan methods. The
structures were solved and refined using the package WinGX.37 The structures were solved using the SHELXS
program38 and refined based on the full-matrix
least-squares method using the SHELXL program.39 ORTEP projections of the molecular structures were generated
using the ORTEP-3 program,37 which are
presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S24). Additional information regarding the data collection
and structure refinement can be observed in Tables 3 and 4. Compounds 5, 8, and 9 were previously reported.23,29 Crystallographic data for the structural analysis of the compounds
have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center
with the deposition numbers of 780275 (1), 1541209 (2), 1541207 (3), 1541208 (4), 993665
