KBiFe2O5 (KBFO)
is an upcoming promising
brownmillerite-structured multiferroic photoactive material for next-generation
photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. In the present work,
KBFO has been developed using multistep thermal treatment method to
reduce the volatility of constituent elements and improve the stability
of compound. The band gap of KBFO (found to be ∼1.68 eV) extends
to the near-infrared region compared to traditional perovskite-structured
multiferroics. The magnetic and dielectric transitions occur in the
same temperature range (740 K–800 K), reflecting the existence
of magneto-dielectric effect in the as-synthesized sample. It also
shows promising photocatalytic activity by degrading organic effluents
under natural sunlight compared to regular perovskite BiFeO3 photocatalyst (operating under visible light). A new application
of brownmillerite multiferroic KBFO photocatalyst in environmental
and energy applications has been explored by integrating the structural,
optical, magnetic, and dielectric properties of the same.

Introduction
In recent years, multiferroic
materials have gained enormous attention
in the field of next-generation photovoltaics (PV). We come across
various multiferroics with higher photovoltages (attributed to their
band gap) justifying their potential application in photovoltaic and
photocatalytic applications.1 Multiferroic
compounds are advantageous over ferroelectric compounds due to their
lower band gap, which is an important requirement for PV applications.
However, most of these ferroelectric materials, e.g., PbTiO3, PbZrO3, PbZr1–xTixO3, etc., being lead (Pb)-based perovskites,
are hazardous to the environment. Few of the lead-free ferroelectric
materials, e.g., BaTiO3, KNbO3, and NaTaO3, have wide band gaps2−4 and hence fail to utilize a wider
range of solar energy. Overall, these perovskite ferroelectric materials
have large band gap above 3 eV and can absorb only a small range of
solar spectra. Multiferroics have relatively lower band gaps compared
to ferroelectric materials due to the influence of magnetic ordering
on electron–electron interaction resulting in a lower band
gap as well as improved photocurrents.5 One of the lead (Pb)-free perovskite multiferroic compounds, which
has attracted enormous interest to date, is BiFeO3 with
a band gap of ∼2.6 eV.6 BiFeO3 has a lower band gap compared to the typical perovskite ferroelectric
material due to the coexistence of both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic
characteristics. However, its theoretical photovoltaic efficiency
is limited to about 7%,7 which can be overcome
by decreasing the band gap to IR region. A lower band gap facilitates
improved photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance of such compounds.
Brownmillerites, which are derived from perovskite structures (ABO3) and have an empirical formula A2B2O5, boast of lower band gaps compared to many perovskites.
Typical perovskite-structured multiferroic materials with corner-sharing
BO6 octahedra lose their dielectric and magnetic properties
at higher temperatures.7−10 Brownmillerite-structured (A2B2O5) compounds with their oxygen-deficient nature need to be explored
as an alternative. A2B2O5-like structures
possess oxygen deficiency along the [110] direction and corner-sharing
BO6 octahedra alternate with rows of corner-sharing BO4 tetrahedra.11−14 Typically, Fe-based brownmillerite compounds contain FeO4 tetrahedra leading to the occurrence of lower band gaps unlike Fe-based
perovskites, which consist of FeO6 octahedra only.15 The lower band gap of Fe-based brownmillerite
compounds is attributed to the presence of shorter Fe–O bond
lengths and high covalence in FeO4 tetrahedron compared
to FeO6 octahedron.16,17 Oxygen deficiency in
the brownmillerite structure also leads to high Curie temperature
(Tc) and lower band gap (Eg), which is a major advantage over typical ABO3 perovskite structures.18,19 Two well-known brownmillerite
compounds, Sr2Fe2O5 and Ca2Fe2O5, too exhibit high Tc (Curie temperature) and lower band gap.20,21

Perovskite- and brownmillerite-structured metal oxides are
also
potential materials for catalytic applications.22 The catalytic activity in perovskite-type metal oxides
is attributed mostly to the presence of B-site transition-metal cation.23 The catalytic properties of these metal oxides
have already been related to the number of d-electrons and occupancy
of the antibonding orbitals of M–OH.24 Enhanced catalytic activity of perovskites with oxygen vacancies22,25 motivates the fact that brownmillerites (with ordered oxygen vacancies)
can act as a potential catalytic material. These brownmillerites exhibit
smaller band gap compared to regular perovskites, rendering an additional
advantage to the material to absorb the broad spectrum of sunlight.
A thorough investigation of the role of brownmillerite KBiFe2O5 (KBFO) in sunlight-driven photocatalytic degradation
of organics dyes can help us to confirm the same.

KBiFe2O5 is one of the recently discovered
novel brownmillerite compounds having high Tc (∼780 K). It consists of tetrahedral Fe3+ in a Fe2O3 block that alternates with a [(K,Bi)O2] block. KBiFe2O5 synthesized by hydrothermal
method has shown a band gap of 1.59 eV.7 However, the yield from hydrothermal synthesis is low and the time
taken to form KBFO crystalline sediment is as high as 72 h. Moreover,
the crystalline sediments synthesized by this method are not suitable
to fabricate nano/microstructured thin films for solar cell application.
KBFO has shown promising magnetic and dielectric properties and reported
a significant photovoltaic effect.4,12,20 In the present work, we explore the synthesis of
KBFO by multistep thermal treatment unlike one-step thermal treatment
reported by Zhai et al.26 Multistep thermal
treatment synthesis can reduce the synthesis temperature to 650 °C
compared to previous reports.15,26

The compound
gains importance due to the fact that multiferroic
KBFO exhibits spontaneous polarization upon illumination by visible
light irradiation, causing an imbalance of charges, thereby inducing
a strong internal electric field leading to separation of charges.7 These charges are responsible for redox reactions
involved in photocatalysis. The possibility of enhanced charge separation
in KBFO upon irradiation by light has motivated us to explore natural
sunlight-driven photocatalytic responses by degrading organic dyes
such as methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR). The photocatalytic
properties of brownmillerite multiferroics have been overlooked by
many researchers. Hence, the present work forms a crucial part of
primary investigations for any future exploration of KBFO as a potential
candidate for environmental and energy applications.

Results and Discussion
The structural properties of as-synthesized samples were analyzed
by room-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 1a). In earlier reports, secondary phases
have been observed in KBFO samples synthesized at 650 °C by one-step
thermal treatment method.15,26 Bismuth trioxide (Bi2O3) is one of the primary precursors in the synthesis
of KBFO. Bi2O3 exists in six different phases
such as monoclinic (α-Bi2O3), body-centered
cubic (γ-Bi2O3), face-centered cubic (fcc)
(δ-Bi2O3), tetragonal (β-Bi2O3), triclinic (ω-Bi2O3), and orthorhombic (ε-Bi2O3).27−33 Among them, α-phase is the most stable at room temperature,
whereas the other five forms are unstable crystal modifications formed
at high temperatures. Hence, if the synthesis temperature goes beyond
the phase-transition temperature (729 °C) of Bi2O3, it transforms into δ-Bi2O3 phase,
which is stable at high temperature.34 Existence
of fcc (δ-Bi2O3) phase and other polymorphs
of Bi2O3 may lead to the formation of pyrochlore
phases, which were observed in KBFO synthesized at higher temperatures
by one-step thermal treatment method.15,26 In the present
work, unlike the one-step thermal treatment method, samples were heated
multiple times at lower temperatures. Initially, hand-milled precursors
were calcined at 550 °C (K5) for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
The sample was cooled down to room temperature. However, XRD and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies confirmed that single-phase
KBFO phase could not be achieved at this temperature. Hence, K5 samples
were further calcined at 650 °C (K6) at the same heating rate
leading to single-phase KBFO. Further calcination of K6 samples at
750 °C (K7) led to the occurrence of pyrochlore phase in XRD
pattern. Hence, KBFO synthesis temperature was optimized to 650 °C,
which is lower compared to earlier reports. This multistep thermal
treatment is advantageous over the one-step thermal treatment method
as it reduces the final synthesis temperature as well as the volatility
of elements and improves the stability of synthesized compound.

(c) K6, and (d) K7.

Table 1 gives a
clear account of KBFO synthesis methods, growth parameters, and the
corresponding band gaps reported to date. Figure 1a–d shows the XRD pattern and SEM
images of the samples calcined at different temperatures. As is evident
from the XRD pattern in Figure 1a in the present case, the single-phase compound could be
obtained at 650 °C (K6) by multistep thermal treatment method.26,35 Brownmillerite characteristic peak of (110) was found to be absent
for 550 °C synthesized sample (K5), whereas it was observed for
both K6 and K7 (750 °C) samples.11 Morphology of the as-prepared samples was investigated by SEM. The
corresponding image of K5 sample (non-brownmillerite phase) showed
irregular morphology with no defined structures. As we move to K6
samples with a single phase, regular interconnected grains start to
appear. Upon increasing the calcination temperature to 750 °C
for K7, larger platelike morphology was observed (Figure 1b–d). The morphology
of K7 (with a secondary pyrochlore phase) is different and seemingly
provides larger grains with a low surface area/porosity, which is
undesirable for catalytic activity.

XPS was employed to determine the elemental composition
and electronic
state of constituent elements shown in Figure 2a–c. The spin–orbit splitting
values of Fe 2p components for K5, K6, and K7 samples were found to
be ∼13.2 eV. A satellite peak appeared at about 8 eV above
the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 shown
in Figure 2a. The Fe
2p peak could be fitted (Lorentzian–Gaussian fitting) to two
peaks indicating the presence of both octahedral and tetrahedral species
in Fe3+ oxidation state, typical for brownmillerite compounds.
Brownmillerite compounds have FeO6 (octahedra) and FeO4 (tetrahedra) species in alternative layers of crystal structure
with ordered oxygen vacancies along the 110 direction.11−14 For ideal Fe-based brownmillerite compounds, the Fe3+ (tet)/Fe3+ (oct) ratio is estimated to be 1.37 For K5 samples, the Fe 2p3/2 and
Fe 2p1/2 could be fitted to a single peak at 711.8 eV and
725.3 eV, respectively, which indicates the presence of Fe3+ (oct) only. Both XRD and XPS studies confirm that calcination at
550 °C does not lead to brownmillerite KBFO phase. Since the
powder XRD patterns of K6 and K7 samples appear similar, finding traces
of Fe oxide and confirming brownmillerite KBFO phase from room-temperature
XRD pattern is difficult. However, as is clear from the XPS fitting
of Fe 2p spin–orbit, the peaks for K6 as well as K7 samples
could be fitted to two peaks. In K6, Fe 2p3/2 is fitted
to two peaks at 711.4 and 713.8 eV, and Fe 2p1/2 spin–orbit
peak is fitted to 724.9 and 727.7 eV, which correspond to the Fe3+ in octahedra (FeO6) and tetrahedra (FeO4) coordinations. Similar to that in K7, Fe 2p3/2 fitted
to two peaks at 710.4 and 712.8 eV and Fe 2p1/2 spin–orbit
is fitted to 723.9 and 726.7 eV, which correspond to the Fe3+ in octahedra (FeO6) and tetrahedra (FeO4)
coordination. The Fe3+ (tet) to Fe3+ (oct) ratio
was slightly higher in K6 (0.35) compared to K7 (0.34), which indicates
that K6 possesses more Fe3+ (tet) coordination compared
to K7, a significant feature of brownmillerite compound.37,38 The binding energy of Bi–O peaks, as obtained from the Bi
4f spin–orbit studies for sample K5 (Figure 2b), point toward the absence of brownmillerite
phase of KBFO. It is also revealed that the Bi 4f7/2 and
Bi 4f5/2 peaks shift toward lower energy in K7 pointing
toward the weakening of Bi–O bonds in KBiFe2O5. When Bi–O bonds are weakened, it alters the bond
angles and bond lengths of neighboring Fe atoms39 as is clear from the Fe 2p spin–orbit peak shifting
toward lower energy (Figure 2b). Hence, a detailed analysis of XPS data shows that a growth
temperature of 650 °C is the optimized growth temperature for
KBFO in the present case.

fits belonging

It is likely that the magnetic ordering in KBFO influences
the
electron–electron interaction in the compound, which leads
to a lower band gap compared to ferroelectric compounds.15 Magnetism in such compounds could be an additional
advantage in applications such as photocatalysis, to retrieve the
catalyst after effluent treatment by applying an external magnetic
field. Considering the above option, the magnetic properties of KBFO
have been investigated in detail. The M–H curves of the as-synthesized KBFO samples were recorded
at room temperature with a maximum magnetic field of 20 kOe, as shown
in Figure 3a. S-type
hysteresis loop is observed for all samples. K5 sample showed higher
coercivity compared to K6 and K7 (Figure 3a). It also reveals weak ferromagnetism,
which can be attributed to the presence of traces of Fe oxide. The
absence of brownmillerite KBFO phase in K5 sample has already been
confirmed by both XRD and XPS studies. K6 shows the highest magnetization
value ∼1.91 emu/g at a magnetic field of 20 kOe along with
a coexistence of weak ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic behavior,
which was revealed in temperature-dependent magnetization (M–T) curve with two transitions
(Figure 3b). Upon increasing
the synthesis temperature from 650 to 750 °C, the magnetization
value decreased from 1.91 emu/g to 0.6 emu/g (Figure 3c). The M–T curve of K7 samples shows a dominant antiferromagnetic
nature, and the magnetization decreases from (1.91 emu/g) K6 to (0.6
emu/g) K7 sample. From XPS studies, it was clear that the peaks corresponding
to Bi 4f and O 2p shift toward lower energy for K7 indicating weakening
of the Bi–O bond. Since Bi is a nonmagnetic element, the weakening
of Bi–O bonds may not affect the magnetic properties of KBFO
directly. However, it affects the bond length and angles of neighboring
magnetic element (Fe), thereby altering Fe binding energy leading
to lower values of magnetization.39 Thus,
the decrease in magnetization in K7 sample could be attributed to
the weakening of Bi–O bonds, as observed by XPS studies.

KBFO with different synthesis temperatures. (b) Magnetization of KBFO

The phenomenon of spontaneous polarization in KBFO is expected
to assist the photovoltaic and photocatalytic phenomena. Hence, the
dielectric properties of K6 were investigated at different frequencies
and temperatures (Figure 4a,b). Temperature-dependent dielectric constant (ε)
and dielectric loss (tan δ) were measured at 10 Hz, 100
Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 100 kHz by varying temperature from 303 to
800 K.

Figure 4 (a) Dielectric constant of KBFO as a function of temperature measured
at 101–5 Hz; (b) dielectric loss tangent as a function
of temperature.

The dielectric constant
(ε) of sample K6 decreases rapidly
with increase in frequency, as shown in Figure 4a. This is a typical phenomenon interpreted
by the Maxwell–Wagner model. The higher values of ε at
lower frequencies are due to the contribution of various polarizations
such as space charges, ionic defects, and permanent dipoles and induced
atomic and ionic dipoles.15,40 With the increase in
frequency, few of these contributions to dielectric constant (ε)
decrease. For example, the space charges cannot follow the reversal
of fields at higher frequencies, and then undergo relaxation due to
their large effective mass.15 From the
ε vs T curve (Figure 4a), a maximum ε was observed at about
750–760 K, which is close to the reported Curie temperature
(Tc = 780 K) of KBFO.7 The antiferromagnetic transition for K6 in the M vs T plot (Figure 3b) also sets in at about the same temperature.
It is worth noting that the magnetic and dielectric transitions with
respect to temperature occur around the same temperature range and
reflects the magneto-dielectric effect in the as-synthesized sample.

Optical absorption study of K6 samples (Figure 5a) reveals absorption in the visible to NIR
region with a band gap of ∼1.68 eV. The single-phase sample
(K6) was further investigated for photodegradation and potential photocatalysis
application. The band gap of KBFO has an excellent spectral match
with solar spectra compared to some of existing multiferroics and
semiconductors for PV and photocatalytic applications. It is different
from the conventional semiconductor photocatalysts in the sense that
separation of charges occur in the presence of electric field. Light
irradiation leads to charge imbalance in domains of polycrystalline
KBFO due to spontaneous polarization. The coexistence of both ferroelectric
and magnetic properties enhances the photocatalytic performance
of KBFO. A schematic of the mechanism of dye degradation is presented
in Figure 5b. The ferroelectric
nature of KBFO is responsible for inducing redox reactions upon solar
light illumination. The magnetic properties of KBFO are an additional
asset to photocatalytic process. In addition to lower band gap, the
magnetic behavior of such samples can also be used for separation
of KBFO particles from the dye suspension by applying strong external
magnetic field after photodegradation, providing an economical and
natural method. Tuning of magnetic properties will enable us to obtain
a magnetically retrievable photocatalyst, as a smart photocatalyst
for next-generation photodegradation applications.

Utilization of KBFO for
remediation of polluted water was explored
by the photodegradation activity of Methylene blue (MB) and Congo
red (CR) organic dyes under direct sunlight irradiation. The initial
dye concentration was kept at Co: 1 ×
10–5 mol/L. The catalyst-loaded dye solution (10
mg/10 mL) was thoroughly blended using ultrasonication under dark
condition. The experiment was conducted for different time intervals
under natural sunlight, and the dyes were found to degrade eventually.
The sunlight illuminance profile throughout the experiment was recorded,
and is shown in Figure S1.

A possible
degradation pathway for MB is shown in Figure 6. During the dissolution of
MB in water, Cl– ion separates from MB core structure.
During photodegradation of MB in the presence of catalyst, active
species such as OH• and HO2• are generated. These active species break the N–CH3 bond and then oxidize −CH3 groups, which are connected
to the terminal of core structure. They also break the S–N
and C–N bonds and produce unstable organic byproducts. The
oxidization reactions continue until the MB degrades completely into
smaller inorganic products such as H2O, CO2,
NO3, SO42–, and Cl–.41,4241,42

Figure 6 Possible degradation
pathway of MB.

The sunlight-driven degradations
of both MB and CR were recorded
at regular intervals using UV–visible absorption spectroscopy.
After 150 min of sunlight exposure, MB and CR were degraded by 97
and 96.7% of their initial concentration, respectively. The degradation
profile, C/Co ratio graph,
and photocatalytic reaction kinetics of MB using KBFO (K6) are also
evaluated as shown in Figure 7a,b. The degradation rate of MB in the presence of KBFO is
determined to be 0.0252 min–1, which is approximately
106 times higher compared to the degradation of bare MB (0.00023 min–1). The photodegradation studies of CR are discussed
in Supporting Information Figure S2.

profile of MB in the presence of K6. (b) C/Co for MB under natural sunlight;
the inset shows the photocatalytic reaction kinetics.

Reusability of photocatalyst determines its role
in practical applications.
To verify the reusability of KBFO photocatalyst, repeated photocatalytic
tests were performed for three cycles, as shown in Figure 8. For first two cycles, there
was no significant change in photodegradation performance of KBFO.
In the third cycle, a slight reduction in photodegradation efficiency
was observed, which could be attributed to low solar light intensity
compared to the first two cycles. XRD results on KBFO, before and
after photocatalysis, are shown in Figure S3 revealing the stability of KBFO after three cycles of degradation.

Figure 8 Reusability
of KBFO for the degradation MB for three cycles.

The photocatalytic mechanism of KBFO under the influence
of various
scavengers [AgNO3, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
and isopropyl alcohol (IPA)] is summarized in Figure 9a,b. KBFO, without any scavengers, showed
a photodegradation rate (k) of 0.0252 min–1. Addition of AgNO3 (1 mmol) as electron (e–) scavenger to the dye–catalyst solution has no significant
effect on photodegradation performance (k = 0.026
min–1). Similarly, when hydroxyl radical (OH•) species are trapped by the addition of IPA (1 mmol)
during photocatalysis, no significant change in the photocatalytic
degradation was observed (k = 0.0226 min–1). This suggests that electrons (e–) and OH• radicals are not primary active species for MB degradation.
In the presence of hole (h+) scavenger EDTA (1 mmol), the
photodegradation performance slowed down (k = 0.0062
min–1), which was lower compared to KBFO in the
absence of any scavenger (k = 0.0252 min–1). Therefore, active species trapping experiments point toward the
fact that the photocatalytic performance of KBFO is mainly governed
by holes (h+).

Figure 9 (a, b) Comparison of photocatalytic activities
of KBFO catalyst
for the degradation of MB with or without adding various scavengers.

The band gap of KBFO is closer
to the infrared region with a higher
tendency to generate photoinduced charge carriers compared to UV-operated
compounds. The UV-operated photocatalyst can absorb only 5% of sunlight
coming to earth.43 For a better understanding
of the present work, an elaborate comparison of the photocatalytic
activity of KBFO with perovskite BiFeO3 photocatalyst is
provided in Table S1. Since BiFeO3 is one such perovskite that has been widely reported for its photocatalytic
activities, this comparison gives us the state of the art when it
comes to perovskites. The results discussed here are encouraging for
an emerging photocatalyst as a pollutant remedial measure.

Conclusions
Brownmillerite-structured multifunctional KBiFe2O5 was synthesized by multistep thermal treatment method and
reduced synthesis temperature to avoid any phase transition. The presence
of a magneto–dielectric coupling in as-synthesized KBFO enables
light irradiation to produce charge imbalance in domains of polycrystalline
KBFO due to spontaneous polarization, thus enhancing the photodegradation
activity by KBFO. Repeated photodegradation of Methylene blue (MB)
and Congo red (CR) is conducted under sunlight for three cycles, verifying
the reusability of photocatalyst for degradation of MB. Active species
trapping experiments showed that the photocatalytic performance of
KBFO is mainly governed by holes (h+) with partial contribution
from OH• radical species. The photodegradation performance
of KBFO was compared to the already existing perovskite BiFeO3 in the visible region. In this regard, KBiFe2O5 would be an efficient multifunctional solar energy-harvesting
material for energy and environmental applications.

Experimental
Section
Preparation and Characterization of Materials
Highly
pure precursors of Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and K2CO3 are mixed in a stoichiometric
ratio in a mortar, under thorough wet grinding, until a uniform mixture
is obtained. The fine powder is then calcined at 550–750 °C
for 4 h in a muffle furnace in multiple steps at a heating rate of
5 °C/min. The samples will henceforth be referred to as K5 (calcined
at 550 °C), K6 (calcined at 650 °C), and K7 (calcined at
750 °C). The morphological, structural, magnetic, dielectric,
optical, and spectroscopic studies have been performed by a high-resolution
scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta FEG 200), a X-ray diffractometer
(Bruker S4 pioneer), a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM EZ9, Microsense
Inc.), a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Jasco, V-730), and an
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SPECS GmbH, Germany).

Photocatalytic
Measurements
The photocatalytic performance
of KBiFe2O5 was analyzed by degrading organic
dyes MB and CR under natural sunlight. The initial concentration of
MB and CR was 5 × 10–5 mol/L, and catalyst
concentration was 10 mg/10 mL. Prior to sunlight irradiation, the
suspension was ultrasonicated in the dark for 30 min to achieve the
adsorption–desorption equilibrium. At every 30 min time interval,
10 mL of suspension was collected and catalyst was separated by centrifugation.
The concentration of MB and CR was then detected by measuring the
maximum absorbance at 664 and 498 nm, respectively, using UV–visible
absorption spectroscopy (Jasco, V-730). The collected catalyst powder
was dried before another photodegradation test. The reusability of
catalyst was tested for three cycles.
