The
surface properties of biomolecular gradients are widely known
to be important for controlling cell dynamics, but there is a lack
of platforms for studying them in vitro using inorganic materials.
The changes in various surface properties of an AlxGa1–xN film (0.173 ≤ x ≤ 0.220) with gradient aluminum content were quantified
to demonstrate the ability to modify interfacial characteristics.
Four wet chemical treatments were used to modify the surface of the
film: (i) oxide passivation by hydrogen peroxide, (ii) two-step functionalization
with a carboxylic acid following hydrogen peroxide pretreatment, (iii)
phosphoric acid etch, and (iv) in situ functionalization with a phosphonic
acid in phosphoric acid. The characterization confirmed changes in
the topography, nanostructures, and hydrophobicity after chemical
treatment. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used
to confirm that the chemical composition of the surfaces, in particular,
Ga2O3 and Al2O3 content,
was dependent on both the chemical treatment and the Al content of
the gradient. Spectroscopic evaluation showed red shifts in strain-sensitive
Raman peaks as the Al content gradually increased, but the same peaks
blue-shifted after chemical treatment. Kelvin probe force microscopy
measurements demonstrated that one can modify the surface charge using
the chemical treatments. There were no predictable or controllable
surface charge trends because of the spontaneous oxide-based nanostructured
formations of the bulk material that varied based on treatment and
were defect-dependent. The reported methodology and characterization
can be utilized in future interfacial studies that rely on water-based
wet chemical functionalization of inorganic materials.

1 Introduction
Surface
gradients often utilized in interface studies are designed
and fabricated with specific characteristics in mind such as chemistry,
shape, topography, density, curvatures, and stiffness. The inspiration
behind surface gradients is derived from nature where a number of
processes are facilitated by gradients. For example, cell dynamics
such as growth, differentiation, and migration are mediated by signaling
pathways generated by chemical gradients. The prevalence of chemical
gradients in biological systems has been widely studied but often
details regarding specific chemical concentrations and gradient slopes
are unclear because of a lack of platforms for in vitro studies.1,2 A quantitative understanding of chemical gradients is important
to develop biomedical applications that require control over cell
dynamics, such as tissue regeneration3−5 and axon guidance.6,7

Efforts have been made to mimic gradients by immobilizing
biomolecules
on different surfaces. Hydrogels8,9 and nanofibers10,11 are commonly used materials for in vitro biomolecular gradient studies.
In comparison to organic materials, relatively fewer reports are available
on immobilizing biomolecular gradients on inorganic substrates. III-nitride
semiconductors provide a versatile platform for studying biological
gradients because they are biocompatible and have tunable surface
properties for controlling the immobilization of biomolecules.12−14 Organic interfaces can be formed on inorganic surfaces using chemical
surface treatments that modify the nanostructure and surface chemistry
of inorganic materials such as III-nitrides.15,16 The surface properties of III-nitrides, such as hydrophobicity,
topography, and surface charge, can be modulated through these modifications.16−18 Additionally, compositional monotonic gradients that can be introduced
during III-nitride growth allow for gradient surface modification
by in situ selective chemical etching without the need for complex
approaches such as photolithography,19 microfluidics,11 or bioprinting.20

In this study, AlxGa1–xN (0.173 ≤ x ≤ 0.220)
films were modified using four different wet beaker chemistries to
alter surface properties. The modified surfaces were characterized
using a variety of techniques to measure altered surface properties
along the Al/Ga composition gradient after chemical treatment. The
topography, roughness, and surface charge were evaluated via tapping
mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), respectively. Additionally,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to measure the
changes in the chemical composition of the surface caused upon chemical
treatment along the Al gradient. Raman spectroscopy was employed to
detect strain changes by monitoring strain-sensitive Raman peak positions.
The film composition was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to
determine the value of x of AlxGa1–xN at points of interest
along the film composition gradient. In this work, we demonstrate
that simple wet chemical treatments can be used to modify the surface
properties of an AlxGa1–xN film and that a compositional Al/Ga gradient can
be used to form a surface chemistry gradient. The findings are expected
to serve as guiding principles and design rules for engineering the
surface properties of inorganic substrates for biological interfaces.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Gradient Characterization
and Surface Preparation
The Al content, x, of AlxGa1–xN films has a strong
influence on the properties of the material. Many reports are available
on the dependence of the electrical and optical properties of AlxGa1–xN
on the Al content of the film.21−24 The Al content is also known to affect the dislocation
density of AlxGa1–xN films grown heteroepitaxially on various substrates
because of different levels of strain induced by lattice and thermal
expansion coefficient mismatch.25−27 Surface defect type and density
also vary for variable Al content, which affects the roughness, electron
affinity, and morphology of the surface.18,25,28 We aimed to use these varying surface properties
to selectively modify the surface of an AlxGa1–xN gradient film with composition x varying between 0.173 and 0.220 by using wet etching and
chemical functionalization approaches to form chemical gradients.

As illustrated in Figure 1a, the Al content of the film changed continuously, but we
defined three regions, B–D (Figure 1b), for simplicity of comparison. The wafer
was diced as shown in Figure 1 so that each region of the gradient was treated with all
of the four treatment types, as indicated in Table 1. The Al content of the gradient AlxGa1–xN wafer at
the regions B–D was determined by using standard XRD measurements.
The details are provided in the Supporting Information, and it was summarized that the value of x was
0.173 in region B, 0.204 in region C, and 0.220 in region D.

As shown in Table 1, we compared four different treatments and a clean
sample for each
region of the gradient. The chemical treatments we used in this investigation
were aqueous and low-temperature benchtop techniques, so they can
be done safely and for low cost in a typical chemistry laboratory.
Before the treatments, each piece of the diced wafer was etched with
HCl to remove the native oxide from the surface.16 One set of samples did not receive any further treatment
and are further referred to as clean set of samples. A second and
third set of samples were treated with H2O2 after
HCl etching to passivate the surface with oxyhydroxide.29,30 It has been reported that the amount of oxygen on the surface of
AlxGa1–xN films increases with increasing mole fraction of Al.18 By passivating the surface with oxyhydroxide,
we aimed to control oxide formation on the sample surface of the second
set. After H2O2 passivation, the third set of
the samples was capped with a hydrocarbon using 4-chlorobutyric acid
(C4H7ClO2) to inhibit oxide formation
after chemical treatment. It is well documented in the literature
that the etch rate of H3PO4 at surface pits
resulting from dislocations in III-nitrides is faster than defect-free
areas by the removal of Ga atoms at the surface through oxide formation.17,25,31,32 Preferential etching by H3PO4 forms etch pits
with hexagonal morphology where dislocations are located at the surface
of polar GaN films.17,33,34 We used H3PO4 to modify the surface nanostructure
and chemistry of the AlxGa1–xN film in the fourth set of samples to cause a change
in surface properties. We added (3-bromopropyl)phosphonic acid (C3H8BrO3P) to H3PO4 for the treatment of the fifth set of samples to functionalize the
surface with a phosphonic acid to prevent oxide formation, which we
have previously reported on GaN.35

2.2 Surface Characterization
Surface
pits with a mean diameter of 0.5 ± 0.2 μm related to dislocations
were observed on the surface of the clean sample. There were oxide
nanopillar clusters, shown in Figure 2a, across the clean surface and the H2O2- and H2O2-/C4H7ClO2-treated surfaces.36 The
shape of the pillars varied from rectangular to hexagonal. Because
the pillar clusters were observed on the clean surface, it suggests
that they were not formed during chemical treatment. The H2O2- and H2O2-/C4H7ClO2-treated surfaces had clusters of truncated
rectangular nanostructures with striations along the length, as shown
in Figure 2b,c, with
the morphology of GaOOH particles.37,38 The lengths
were distributed into two groups: 1.1 ± 0.2 and 0.4 ± 0.02
μm. These were also seen on the clean surface but with much
lower frequency, indicating that H2O2 promotes
the formation of these nanostructures. Hexagonal etch pits were observed
after treating with H3PO4 and H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P (Figure 2d), with primarily two sizes.
The larger etch pits had a mean width of 23.4 ± 1.0 μm,
whereas the smaller etch pits had a 5.4 ± 0.2 μm mean width.
Smaller pits were observed on the clean surface but were not seen
on the H3PO4-etched surfaces because they were
enlarged through etching. Another unique feature observed on the H3PO4- and H3PO4-/C3H8BrO3P-treated surfaces was needle-like oxide
nanostructures with a mean length of 4.1 ± 1.2 μm protruding
from the surface, as shown in Figure 2e.39,40

(e) H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P. False coloring added using ImageJ (version 1.52n).

Figure 3 shows that
there were no statistical differences or trends in the roughness with
respect to the Al content (see the Supporting Information for summary of all statistical analysis). However,
we observed that there were statistically significant differences
in the roughness between C and D regions of the H2O2-treated surfaces and various gradient regions of the other
treatments. Although there was not a trend in the roughness results,
the combined results of AFM and SEM characterization indicated that
we were able to modify the topography of the surface through chemical
treatments. The lack of a trend in the AFM data could be explained
by the relatively small 2 μm × 2 μm scans obtained
at arbitrary locations on each surface (representative AFM images
can be found in the Supporting Information). The various nanostructures in Figure 2 that we observed via SEM should affect the
roughness. However, they were formed at random locations on the surface
and were similar in size to the scan size, so there was no guarantee
that such a feature was included in the AFM scans. Because we observed
statistical differences in the roughness and nanostructure formation,
we conclude that the topography of AlxGa1–xN can be modified through
chemical treatment.

Figure 4 summarizes
water contact angle measurements, which showed that the H3PO4- and H3PO4-/C3H8BrO3P-treated surfaces were the most hydrophilic.
The H2O2 and H2O2/C4H7ClO2 treatments did not affect contact
angle compared to the clean surface. There was no observed trend in
wetting with respect to the Al content variation. This could be explained
by a relatively small increase in x from region B
to region D, which may not be a large enough difference to greatly
influence the etch behavior of the material.

2.3 Chemical Composition Changes
The
atomic percentages of O, C, N, Al, Ga, and P were measured by XPS
survey scans to detect changes in surface composition with respect
to the treatments and Al content. This is summarized in Figure 5. There was no observed trend
in the data from the survey scans corresponding to the Al gradient.
The XRD measurements showed that there was an increase in the Al content
of the film from region B to region D of the film. However, we did
not observe a difference in the Al/Ga composition of the film as measured
by XPS, which we attribute to the presence of large oxide structures
on the surfaces. However, there were differences between treatments.
The Ga 3s, Ga 2p, Ga 3p, Ga 3d, and Ga 3p3/2 peaks were
summed to obtain the total Ga content, which was found to be the element
present in the highest amount for the clean, H2O2, and H2O2/C4H7ClO2 treatments for the B–D regions of the gradient. The
H2O2 and H2O2/C4H7ClO2 treatments had approximately the same
Ga content, 39.24–40.71%, as the clean sample, 37.67–39.66%.
However, the Ga 3p peak was absent and the 3p3/2 was present
for the H2O2 and H2O2/C4H7ClO2 surfaces, while the opposite
was true for the clean surfaces, which indicated that there was a
change in the Ga species after H2O2 passivation.
We observed a decrease in the Ga content between 14.97 and 28.07%
for the H3PO4-etched surface treatments because
Ga was etched from the surface by this treatment. The percentages
of the Ga 3s and Ga 2p peaks were roughly the same as those of the
clean treatment, while the Ga 3p and Ga 3d peaks showed a decrease.
Unlike the clean and H2O2-passivated surfaces,
Ga was not present in the highest quantity for H3PO4 region B and H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P region C, which contained more O than Ga
as measured by the sum of the O 1s and O 2s peaks. The O content was
in the range of 13.42–36.21% for the H3PO4 treatments, while the clean and H2O2 treatments
had less O, ranging from 5.76 to 7.01%. There was also a shift in
the O species present on the surface for the H3PO4 treatments as indicated by an increase in the O 2s peak, which was
absent in the clean and H2O2 spectra. There
was no P present on the clean samples, as determined by the sum of
the P 2p and P 2s peaks. Although we did not intend to alter the P
species on the surface through H2O2 passivation,
the results showed between 10.49 and 11.17% P after treatment, most
likely because of impurities in H2O2 used during
the treatment. We found that the P content was present in the highest
percentage on the H3PO4-treated surfaces with
no difference between the capped and uncapped treatment. We also observed
a P 2s peak for the H3PO4 treatments, indicating
that there was a difference in the P species on the surface compared
to the H2O2-treated surfaces. The amount of
N measured by the N 1s peak was present in the second highest quantity
for the clean and H2O2-containing treatments,
ranging between 29.38 and 33.24%. There was less N for the H3PO4 treatments and, except for H3PO4-B and H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P-C, O was present in the second highest quantity on the surfaces
in the range of 9.18–23.73%. The carbon content, measured by
the C 1s peak, was relatively similar for all treatments. The largest
difference in C content was observed for the H3PO4 treatments, which was between 8.27 and 16.19% compared to 5.22–8.8%
for the clean and H2O2-treated surfaces.

percentages of regions B–D for each treatment:
(a) clean, (b) H2O2, (c) H2O2/C4H7ClO2, (d) H3PO4, and (e) H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P as determined by XPS survey scan.

High-resolution regional XPS scans
of the Al 2p, Ga 3d, O 1s, and
C 1s peaks were analyzed to assess changes in the species present
with respect to treatment and gradient position. These data are summarized
in Figure 6a–d.
There were trends in these results corresponding to both the Al content
gradient and the treatment. The Al 2p peak was deconvoluted to the
Al–N and Al2O3 species, and the data
are summarized in Figure 6a. The Al–N species was found to decrease from region
B to region D for the clean samples. There was a corresponding increase
of Al2O3 on the surface from region B to region
D, which indicated that oxide formation was favored as the Al content
increased, which agrees with the literature.18 We also observed an increase in Al–N and a decrease in Al2O3 from B to D for the H2O2 and H2O2/C4H7ClO2 treatments. There was a greater percentage of Al2O3 on the H2O2-treated surface compared
to that on the clean surface. However, when capped by C4H7ClO2, there was a lower percentage of Al2O3 than the uncapped surface, but there was still
a greater percentage than the clean surface. We note that the total
relative amount of Al2O3 for the clean and H2O2-passivated surfaces was relatively the same
(see the Supporting Information). The surfaces
that were treated only with H3PO4 showed a decrease
in Al–N percentage between B and D, but region C did not lie
between these two values, so there was no clear trend. Similarly,
the percentage of Al2O3 was lower at region
B than at region D, but region C was not between these values. For
regions B–D, the percentage of Al2O3 was
greater after H3PO4 etching. The H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P treatment
caused a significant increase in the percentage of Al–N and
a decrease in the percentage of Al2O3 from B
to D. The magnitude of this change was also much greater than the
changes observed for the other treatments, as shown in Figure 6a. The significant decrease
in Al2O3 with increasing Al content compared
to the other treatments suggested that Al2O3 formation was inhibited by capping the surface with a phosphonic
acid derivative.

gradient
position for the (a) Al 2p, (b) Ga 3d, (c) O 1s, and (d) C 1s peaks.

The Ga 3d peak, shown in Figure 6b, was deconvoluted
to Ga–N, Ga2O3, and Auger Ga–N.
The Auger Ga–N data were relatively
the same for all treatments and gradient regions, ranging from 3.31
to 11.47%, with no trend in the data. The clean surfaces showed an
increase from 50.84 to 75.61% Ga–N and a decrease in Ga2O3 from 37.69 to 12.98% from region B to region
D of the gradient. The decrease in Ga–N correlated to the results
of the Al 2p peak, which showed that the Al–N species decreased
from B to D. Furthermore, there was a decrease in Ga2O3 as Al2O3 increased from B to D. We
found no clear trend in Ga–N and Ga2O3 with respect to the gradient for H2O2 or H2O2/C4H7ClO2. There
were slight changes in the values after these treatments were compared
to clean treatment, but they remained roughly the same. The lowest
value for Ga–N was 51.65% and the largest was 70.62%. For Ga2O3, the smallest and largest values were 21.22
and 29.96%, respectively. The percentage of Ga2O3 was not affected by the gradient in the same way Al2O3 formation was for the H2O2 treatment,
which decreased as the Al content increased. For the capped surface,
we observed similar results, suggesting that capping inhibits both
Al2O3 and Ga2O3 formation.
The trend for H3PO4 and H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P treatments for
Ga–N and Ga2O3 was the same as that for
the clean treatment, although the magnitude of the change was greater
for the H3PO4-containing treatments. From region
B to D, Ga–N increased from 24.84 to 75.86% and Ga2O3 decreased from 69.56 to 18.55% after H3PO4 treatment. The addition of C3H8BrO3P during etching caused an increase in Ga–N from 19.64
to 75.73% and a decrease in Ga2O3 from 74.37
to 16.4% from regions B to D. The increased Ga2O3 percentage after H3PO4 etching compared to
the clean surfaces suggested that Ga2O3 was
more readily formed after etching. However, the magnitude of difference
in Ga2O3 percentage between the H3PO4-etched surfaces and clean surfaces decreased as the
Al content increased. This was also confirmed by comparing the overall
relative Ga2O3 content on the surfaces (see
the Supporting Information). The greatest
relative Ga2O3 content was 13.68% on region
B surface after H3PO4 etching, while the clean
surface had 10.53% at region B. However, at region D, there was a
smaller magnitude of difference between the surfaces that were H3PO4-etched, 9.48%, versus clean surfaces, 7.058%.
Because there was less Al in region B than in region D, more etching
was likely to occur because H3PO4 preferentially
etched Ga–N. Thus, more Ga–N was removed from the surface
to promote Ga2O3 formation by etching. The relative
total amount of Al2O3 did not show a trend,
but it was the highest after H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P treatment at 4.52% and lowest after
H2O2/C4H7ClO2 at 0.73%. This can be explained by relatively low Al content compared
to Ga, which meant fewer Al atoms were available to form Al2O3, so more Ga2O3 was formed. Unlike
Al2O3, capping the surface with a phosphonic
acid derivative did not appear to affect Ga2O3 formation because similar results were observed for the uncapped
H3PO4-treated surface.

The O 1s peak was
deconvoluted into Ga2O3, O=C, and O–H
species, and the results are summarized
in Figure 6c. There
was no trend in Ga2O3, O=C, or O–H
for the clean surface with respect to the gradient. The range of the
O 1s species was 75.61–82.84% Ga2O3,
13.78–21.81% O=C, and 2.58–4.98% O–H.
Similarly, the H2O2- and H2O2/C4H7ClO2-treated surfaces
showed no trend with respect to the gradient and the percentages of
the species were approximately the same as the clean surfaces, 64.45–80.94%
Ga2O3, 11.62–20.22% O=C, and 1.15–23.92%
O–H. The biggest differences in the O 1s species were observed
after treating with H3PO4 and H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P. The O=C
species was not observed on the surface after H3PO4 etching. The percentage of Ga2O3 decreased
to 38.21–45.32% and O–H increased to 54.68–61.79%
after the uncapped H3PO4 treatment, but no trend
with respect to the gradient was observed. However, when capped with
C3H8BrO3P, the percentage of Ga2O3 decreased from 53.64 to 26.44% from regions
B to D and the percentage of O–H content increased from 46.36
to 73.56% from regions B to D. This agreed with the Ga2O3 species of the Ga 3d peak. Furthermore, because the
total percentage of O was not found to change with respect to the
gradient after H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P treatment, as shown in Figure 5, capping the surface with C3H8BrO3P seems to inhibit the formation of Ga2O3 in favor of O–H formation.

The
C 1s peak, shown in Figure 6d, was deconvoluted to C–C, C–O–C,
and O–C=O species. A decrease in C–C from 68.55
to 60.1% and an increase in O–C=O from 13.34 to 21.58%
were observed from regions B to D on the clean surface. No trend was
observed for the C–O–C species on the clean surfaces,
which ranged from 18.11 to 18.34%. After H2O2 treatment, there was a small decrease in C–C from 59.1 to
51.59% and an increase from 26.63 to 32.18% C–O–C from
regions B to D, while there was no trend in O–C=O content.
The overall decrease in C–C and increase in C–O–C
compared to the clean surface confirms a change in the C species after
H2O2 treatment. The percentage of the three
C 1s species did not change with respect to the gradient for the H2O2-/C4H7ClO2-treated
surface. The percentage of each species was 63.03–67.2% C–C,
22.66–24.66% C–O–C, and 8.14–14.3% O–C=O.
Compared to the surfaces treated with only H2O2, there was a slight overall increase in the percentage of C–C
and corresponding decrease in O–C=O on the surface,
which indicated that the surface was functionalized with a carbon
chain by C4H7ClO2. The C species
detected on the H3PO4- and H3PO4-/C3H8BrO3P-treated surfaces
did not have a trend with respect to the gradient. The two treatments
had approximately the same percentage of each species, which ranged
from 67.46 to 75.68% C–C, 18.1 to 21.23% C–O–C,
and 5.28 to 11.31% O–C=O. There was a slight increase
in the overall C–C percentage after both H3PO4 treatments and a decrease in the O–C=O percentage
compared to the clean surfaces for each region of the gradient. However,
because there was no trend with respect to the gradient, it was likely
related to contamination of the surface from the environment.

2.4 Spectroscopic Changes
We recorded
Raman spectra (Figure 7a–c) in the spectral range from 100 to 1000 cm–1 to evaluate the structural characteristics of the AlxGa1–xN film with
respect to the Al content and chemical treatment. The A1(TO) mode of GaN, found between 516.54 and 543.82 cm–1 for each treatment and region of the gradient, shifts to higher
wavenumbers as the Al content of the AlxGa1–xN film increases. This peak
has been reported at 532 cm–1 for unstrained GaN
and the sensitivity of this peak to Al content in AlxGa1–xN alloys has been documented.41,42 The increased Al content red-shifts the phonon frequency because
of strain present in the lattice of GaN as the material becomes more
AlN-like.43 We observed a shift to the
lower wavenumber of the A1(TO) peak after treatment, indicating
that this peak is sensitive to chemical treatment. The shape of the
A1(TO) peak for the clean samples changed as the Al content
increased because the GaN E2(high) peak, located at 587
cm–1 for region D, red shifts as the Al content
increased and separates from the A1(TO) peak. The E2(high) peak has been reported at 567 cm–1 for unstrained GaN and shifted to higher phonon frequencies at a
faster rate than the A1(TO) peak as the Al content increased,
which agrees with our results.42 We observed
a red shift of the E2(low) peak as Al composition increased
from regions B to D and a blue shift after surface treatment. This
peak was reported at 144 cm–1 for unstrained GaN.42 We observed the highest frequency of the E2(low) peak at 153.68 cm–1 for region D (Figure 7c) of the clean surface
and the lowest frequency at 147.97 cm–1 for H2O2-treated region B (Figure 7a). A shoulder at roughly 145 cm–1 was observed for the clean, H3PO4-, and H3PO4-/C3H8BrO3P-treated
surfaces for all regions of the gradient. However, the shoulder coalesced
with the E2(low) peak for the H2O2 and H2O2/C4H7ClO2 treatments. A peak was observed at roughly 894 cm–1 corresponding to the A1(LO) AlN phonon mode.42 It was difficult to differentiate this peak
from the noise because of a low signal. However, it was at roughly
the same frequency for each of the treated samples and region of the
gradient. After H3PO4 etching, a peak at roughly
930 cm–1 became noticeable for all regions of the
gradient.

Figure 7 Raman spectra of the surfaces for the different treatments with
respect to regions of the gradient: (a) region B, (b) region C, and
(c) region D. The treatments appear the same color on each spectrum
as noted in the legend. Insets are included to magnify peaks of interest.

2.5 Surface
Charge Changes
Figure 8 shows a summary of the surface
potential measured by KPFM corresponding to the Al content and surface
treatment. We did not observe a trend with respect to the Al gradient
or treatment. However, there was statistically significant difference
in the results, indicating that we were able to change the surface
potential through surface treatment. This is seen in Figure 8 where the red Greek letters
marked by an asterisk indicate a significant difference in the root-mean-squared
(rms) potential of the surface compared to the surfaces marked with
a corresponding black Greek letter. For example, region B of the H2O2-/C4H7ClO2-treated
surface was statistically different from regions B and D of the H2O2 surface and all regions of the gradient of the
clean, H3PO4-, and H3PO4-/C3H8BrO3P-treated surfaces. The
only significant difference for the H3PO4- and
H3PO4-/C3H8BrO3P-treated surfaces from the other surface treatments was from region
C of H3PO4. The lack of differences indicated
that H3PO4 etching did not tend to significantly
impact the surface potential. We observed the most significant differences
after H2O2/C4H7ClO2 treatments compared to all other treatments, and in all cases
where there was a significant difference, regions B and C of H2O2/C4H7ClO2 had
a greater surface potential. We also observed that there was a significant
difference between region D and regions B and C of the H2O2-/C4H7ClO2-treated
surfaces, indicating that the surface charge was influenced by the
Al gradient. There were also several differences between all regions
of H2O2 and other treatments. However, region
C had a greater surface potential than the significantly different
surfaces, while regions B and D had lower surface potential than the
significantly different surfaces . This suggests that the Al content
can be used to influence surface charge, but it cannot be easily controlled
because of nonuniform formation of nanostructures and chemical species
on the surface.

Figure 8 rms potential of AlxGa1–xN surfaces with respect to the Al
content and surface
treatment measured by KPFM. Red Greek letters marked with an asterisk
indicate a statistically significant difference of the surface potential
compared to samples marked by a corresponding black Greek letter with
no asterisk (ANOVA p < 0.05).

We note that it is difficult to make conclusions about the
entire
surface because the surface potential measured by KPFM was obtained
from small scan areas (500 nm × 500 nm). The relatively large
standard deviations shown in Figure 8 indicated that the surface potential varied over the
area of each surface, so the small scans did not represent the entire
surface. Therefore, we cannot make broad statements about how each
treatment or gradient region affects surface charge. However, because
there were significant differences in Figure 8, we conclude that the surface charge was
modified by chemical treatment. Because we also observed statistical
differences in the surface potential with respect to the gradient,
we conclude that the Al content is also a factor that can be used
to modify the surface charge of the AlxGa1–xN film.

3 Conclusions
We evaluated through a variety of characterization
techniques changes
in the surface properties of an AlxGa1–xN film (0.173 ≤ x ≤ 0.220) after surface treatment with H2O2, H2O2/C4H7ClO2, H3PO4, and H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P. We observed that all
chemical treatments affected the morphology of the nanostructures
on the sample surface in a different way. Compared to the clean surfaces,
which had few nanostructures consisting mostly of clusters of oxide
nanopillars, the H2O2 and H2O2/C4H7ClO2 treatments caused
the formation of clusters of striated rectangular oxide nanostructures.
The H3PO4 and H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P treatments led to unique surfaces
with hexagonal etch pits and needle-like oxide nanostructures. The
roughness of the surface was modified through surface treatment, however,
because the nanostructures formed at uncontrollable positions on the
surface and changes in roughness were not observed across the entire
surface. We demonstrated that the hydrophobicity of the surface can
be modified through H3PO4 and H3PO4/C3H8BrO3P treatments, leading
to a more hydrophilic surface. We did not observe changes in the morphology,
roughness, or hydrophobicity corresponding to the Al gradient, but
we confirmed through XPS that there were changes in the surface chemistry
that depend on the Al content. Most notably, we observed an increase
in the percent of Al2O3 content formed on the
surface with an increase of the Al content on the clean surfaces,
while there was a reversal in this trend after all surface treatments.
The strain-related Raman peaks were observed to shift to higher frequencies
with increasing Al content on the clean surfaces. After surface treatment,
the strain-related peaks shifted to lower frequencies, indicating
that strain was manipulated by the treatments. We also observed that
the surface charge could be modulated by surface chemistry, but like
the roughness, it is not controllably changed because of the unpredictable
formation of surface nanostructures. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the interfacial properties of an AlxGa1–xN
film can be modulated through simple wet beaker chemistry treatments.
The chemical treatments we used modified the surface chemistry of
the AlxGa1–xN film corresponding to the Al/Ga compositional gradient without
the need for more complex patterning approaches. These findings are
useful for applications such as bioelectronics because they can be
used as guiding principles toward the engineering of interfaces with
specific characteristics.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Semiconductor Growth
The AlGaN layer
was grown by Kyma Technology using hydride vapor phase epitaxy. The
nonuniformity in the composition is due to lack of uniformity of the
absolute Al and Ga flux ratio reaching the sample surface across a
2 in. wafer, leading to a nonuniform Al and Ga incorporation in the
solid phase. The lack of uniformity in the Al and Ga atom distributions
across the wafer is related to the nonsymmetric disposition of the
Ga and Al channel exits with respect to the wafer center, which was
further intentionally enhanced by not using wafer rotation during
the film growth. By stopping the wafer rotation during growth, an
intentional composition gradient was achieved.

4.2 Chemical
Modification
The thin-film
wafer was diced into similarly sized pieces of approximately 1 cm
× 1 cm. The periphery of the wafer at the high and low Al content
was not evaluated because of poor quality of the film near the edges.
The samples were split into five groups as shown in Figure 1, allowing for each part of
the gradient to receive four different chemical treatments as described
in Table 1. All individual
samples were cleaned by sonication prior to chemical functionalization
with (i) acetone for 20 min, (ii) methanol for 20 min, and (iii) deionized
(DI) water for 10 min and dried with N2 gas after each
step. The samples were then etched in a solution of equal parts by
volume 12 M HCl and DI water at 80 °C. One group of clean samples
were not treated further. The remaining four groups received one of
the treatments as indicated in Table 1. The technical details of chemical functionalization
can be found in our previous work.35,44

4.3 Contact Angle Measurements
Static
contact angle measurements were performed using a ramé-hart
automated dispensing system and a ramé-hart model 200 F4 series
standard goniometer to collect the images. DI water drops were dispensed
by 2 μL onto the surface. Three measurements were taken for
each sample. DropImage Standard (version 2.4) was utilized for image
analysis.

4.4 AFM and KPFM
Roughness and surface
potential measurements were performed using an Asylum Research MFP-3D
Origin AFM. Roughness measurements were done by scanning three random
positions on each piece of the diced wafer to obtain height, amplitude,
phase, and z-sensor data in air at room temperature by tapping mode.
Images of 2 μm × 2 μm were obtained at a scanning
frequency of 1 Hz using Si probes (f = 150 kHz, k = 8 N/m) from Asylum Research. The rms roughness was obtained
from the images using Igor Pro (version 6.2.2.2).

Surface potential
measurements were performed using the KPFM mode in air at room temperature
with Ti/Ir (5/20)-coated Si probes from Asylum Research (f = 285 kHz, k = 42 N/m). Images of 500 nm ×
500 nm were obtained with a scanning frequency of 1 Hz at three random
positions on each piece of the wafer along the gradient. The samples
were grounded by soldering a copper wire to the wafer surface with
In solder to minimize surface potential drift during the scans, which
was found to be a source of large standard deviations in our previous
work.45 The rms surface potential values
were obtained from the images using Igor Pro (version 6.2.2.2).

4.5 SEM
The nanostructures of the samples
were analyzed using the Tescan MAIA 3 field-emission scanning electron
microscope equipped with an in-beam secondary electron detector and
a back-scattered electron detector. Secondary electron imaging was
done to observe the topography of the samples, and backscattered electrons
were captured to observe elemental differences of the surfaces. Image
processing was performed with ImageJ (version 1.52n).

4.6 XPS
An AXIS Supra X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd, UK) was used to acquire XPS data
by Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV, probe area is 0.7 × 0.3
mm2, resolution is 0.45 eV, measured on the Ag 3d5/2 line width). A survey scan was obtained for each sample. High-resolution
scans of the C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, Ga 3d, Al 2p, and P 2p regions were
performed for each sample. The data were calibrated to the C 1s peak
at 284.8 eV and analyzed using CasaXPS (version 2.3.19PR1.0) to determine
atomic percentages and fit peaks to determine the percentage of specific
chemical species.

4.7 Raman Spectroscopy
A LabRam HR Evolution
0.8 m focal length single-stage spectrometer with diffraction grating
1800/mm was used to perform Raman spectroscopy measurements. The excitation
power of a 532 nm laser was ∼200 W cm–2,
an objective with magnification 100× collected signals from approximately
a 1 μm circular spot. Three survey scans at random positions
in the region 100–1000 cm–1 were obtained
per sample with an acquisition time of 10 s and 30 accumulations.
The three scans obtained for each sample were averaged, normalized,
and analyzed using Origin 2018b (version b9.5.5.409).

4.8 Statistical Analysis
Origin 2018b
(version b9.5.5.409) was utilized to perform all statistical analyses
using two-way ANOVA tests with a significance level of 0.05.
