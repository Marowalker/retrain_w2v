The inverse electron
demand Diels–Alder conjugation reaction
has gained increasing importance over the past few years for efficient
in vivo and ex vivo radiometal labeling of antibodies. However, the
application of this very fast reaction type has not been studied for
radiolabeling of peptides so far. We show here the synthesis of 3-benzyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-comprising
((1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-4,7,10-triyl)triacetic acid-1-glutaric
acid) (DOTA–GA) and ((1,4,7-triazacyclononane-4,7-diyl)diacetic
acid-1-glutaric acid) (NODA–GA) chelators and their radiometal
labeling with 68Ga3+ and 64Cu2+. The secondary labeling precursors 68Ga–DOTA–GA–Tz, 68Ga–NODA–GA–Tz, and 64Cu–DOTA–GA–Tz
were obtained in high radiochemical yields (RCYs) and purities as
well as molar activities for further labeling of trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-modified peptides. However, the following reactions
of the radiometal-labeled tetrazines with different TCO-comprising
model peptide analogs unexpectedly resulted in the formation of a
considerable amount of side products (20–55%) which limits
the overall achievable RCYs and purities as well as molar activities
of the target radiopeptides. Under otherwise identical, nonradioactive
reaction conditions, this effect could however not be observed. In
contrast, the corresponding one-step radiolabeling protocols provided
the target 68Ga-labeled radiopeptides in exceptionally
high RCYs and purities of ≥99% and molar activities of 68–72
GBq/μmol starting from activities of 340–358 MBq of 68Ga. Thus, the usefulness of the two-step labeling of TCO-modified
peptides with radiometal-labeled chelator-tetrazines seems to be limited.

Introduction
Chemoselective and
highly efficient conjugation reactions play
an important role in radiochemistry, as the modification of biologically
active substances in an ideally defined position of the molecule has
to be possible within a reasonable time frame compared to the half-life
of the respective radionuclide.

Among the available so-called
click chemistry reactions, the inverse
electron demand Diels–Alder (iEDDA) reaction has emerged as
one of the most important biomolecule ligation reactions over the
past few years. This reaction type not only proceeds chemoselectively
without requiring any catalyst at physiological pH and ambient temperature,
but also exhibits exceptionally fast reaction kinetics even at very
low reactant concentrations, rendering the iEDDA reaction an extremely
powerful ligation technique in radiochemistry.1

Over the past few years, the iEDDA reaction has been shown
to be
a versatile click chemistry approach for the labeling of small molecules,
peptides, and proteins with 18F, but also for radiometal
labeling with 68Ga, 64Cu, 89Zr, 99mTc, and 177Lu.1

In the case of radiometal labeling, the iEDDA reaction is usually
used for in vivo labeling of antibodies or antibody fragments via
the so-called pretargeting approach. Thereby, a dienophile-modified
protein (in general, trans-cyclooctene (TCO) is used)
is applied to the animal and the antibody is given time to accumulate
in the target lesion (usually a tumor) which takes about 1–3
days. After this time, a clearing agent can—but not necessarily
has to—be used to remove residual antibody from the circulation.
Subsequently, the radiometal-labeled tetrazine is applied, reacting
with the protein in vivo and by this visualizes the antibody distribution
and the tumor target. This approach enables a very fast and clear
visualization of the target structure only a few hours after injection
of the radiolabeled tetrazine,2−4 resulting in a much faster imaging
in diagnostic settings and reduces the dose applied to healthy organs
and tissues in therapeutic settings compared to the use of directly
labeled antibodies.5,6

For the common direct labeling
of antibodies, 89Zr is
a very favorable radionuclide as it exhibits a long half-life of 3.27
days and emits positrons of a low mean energy of 0.389 MeV enabling
positron emission tomography (PET) images of high resolution.7 Due to these favorable properties, 89Zr is also clinically applied for tumor imaging by positron emission
tomography (PET) using 89Zr-labeled antibodies. A limitation
for the use of such 89Zr-labeled antibodies is, however,
the stable complexation of the radiometal. The currently clinically
used chelating agent for 89Zr-introduction is desferrioxamine
B (DFO)8−10 which is, however, not able to stably encapsulate
the radiometal so that it gets released from the complex under in
vivo imaging conditions. This results in a considerable background
activity and, more importantly, the liberated 89Zr accumulates
in mineral bone, depositing a significant dose in the bone marrow.11−14 Thus, several groups have been working on the development of new
chelating agents that are able to stably complex 89Zr over
the past few years with some of them having shown very favorable results
regarding an increased stability of the formed 89Zr-complexes.15−18

Among these, ((1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrayl)tetraacetic
acid) (DOTA) was described to form stable complexes with 89Zr in an initial in vivo evaluation setting. But so far, only the
stability of the unconjugated 89Zr–DOTA-complex
has been studied under in vivo conditions15 which, however, does not allow a proper judgment of the 89Zr–DOTA stability when used for antibody labeling as the unconjugated
complex gets eliminated from the circulation and the organism relatively
fast. In contrast, 89Zr-labeled antibodies exhibit much
slower pharmacokinetics, and thus, a much longer residence time in
the organism which increases the probability of complex challenge,
and thus, 89Zr liberation. To be able to obtain a correct
assessment of the stability of the 89Zr–DOTA complex
compared to 89Zr–DFO, the in vivo pharmacokinetics
of antibody conjugates of both complexes have to be determined under
identical conditions.

For this purpose, a chelating agent based
on the DOTA chelator
core has to be developed which can efficiently be conjugated to antibodies
or other biologically active molecules such as peptides. As a functional
group for biomolecule conjugation, the iEDDA click chemistry reaction
is especially suitable as it enables—due to the aforementioned
advantages—the fast and chemoselective introduction of the
radiometal-containing complex into sensitive biomolecules.

Furthermore,
tetrazines are expected to be of significantly higher
thermal stability than, for e.g., isothiocyanates or active esters
and due to this they are much better suited for radiometal incorporation
of respectively functionalized chelators at elevated temperatures
as they are often required for radiometal labeling.

Although
different DOTA–tetrazines have been developed over
the past few years,11,19−21 the 89Zr4+ cation requires 8 donor atoms and a complete encapsulation
of the central ion to achieve a high complex stability. Acid amides,
however (resulting from the conjugation of one of the carboxylates
of DOTA to a tetrazine, and thus, perspectively to a biomolecule),
do not offer the same coordinative strength than carboxylates, potentially
decreasing the resulting complex stability.22,23 Thus, a DOTA–tetrazine can be assumed to not form complexes
as stable as, for e.g., a backbone-modified DOTA or a ((1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-4,7,10-triyl)triacetic
acid-1-glutaric acid) (DOTA–GA)-based chelator with 89Zr.

Thus, we intended to develop here a chelating agent based
on DOTA–GA
and a 3-benzyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine scaffold (the latter exhibiting a
significantly higher reactivity than its methylated analog 3-benzyl-6-methyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine1) which can be efficiently introduced into biomolecules
of different kinds and complexities by the iEDDA reaction. For this
purpose, the chelator should be modified with a tetrazine instead
of a TCO functional group as the latter was described to be susceptible
to thermally induced isomerization to its 105-fold less
reactive cis-isomer24,25—reaction
conditions which are however required for efficient radiometal complexation
by DOTA derivatives.15,26 Using this DOTA-GA-tetrazine
derivative, the 89Zr-labeling of even susceptible biomolecules
such as antibodies would become possible by a two-step radiolabeling
protocol (Figure 1).

In the following, we intended to assess the suitability of the
developed chelating agent for radiometal labeling of biomolecules
on a model biomolecule–radiometal nuclide system which enables
an efficient and detailed analysis of the obtained products (in this
regard, peptides are better suited than proteins due to their limited
structural complexity) using a radiometal of widespread availability
(68Ga3+ instead of 89Zr4+ as DOTA–GA should be a well-suited chelating agent for both
radionuclides with regard to complex formation and stability).

Furthermore, since no labeling of smaller bioactive molecules than
antibodies has been shown using radiometal-labeled tetrazines so far,
we not only intend to synthesize a DOTA–GA–3-benzyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine
and show its radiometal labeling using 68Ga as model nuclide,
but further intended to study the introduction of the radiometal-labeled
DOTA–GA–tetrazine into TCO-modified peptides of different
sizes and complexities to assess the applicability of the approach
for biomolecule–radiometal labeling in general. In particular,
we aimed to determine if there are any differences in terms of labeling
yields, molar activities, or reaction kinetics in peptide labeling
depending on the molecular complexity of the peptide to be labeled
or between direct, one-step and two-step radiometal labeling (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic depiction of
one- (A) and two-step (B) labeling towards
radiometal-labeled peptides via the iEDDA conjugation reaction using
tetrazine-comprising chelators and accordingly TCO-functionalized
peptides.

The obtained results should be
directly transferrable to the radiometal
labeling of other biologically active molecules, such as antibodies.

Results
and Discussion
As mentioned before, the iEDDA reaction has
emerged as one of the
most important biomolecule ligation techniques over the past few years
being of special interest for the radiolabeling of biomolecules due
to its high reaction efficiency. In contrast to other reaction types
often used in radiolabeling such as the formation of acid amides or
thioureas using active esters or isothiocyanates of radionuclide-comprising
secondary labeling precursors, tetrazines exhibit the significant
advantage of reacting chemoselectively, thus, only reacting with dienophiles
but not with other functional groups usually present in biomolecules
such as amino acid side chain functionalities or N- or C-termini of
peptides or proteins. Furthermore, the radiolabel has to be introduced
into the secondary labeling precursor molecule, a reaction for which
elevated temperatures are often required which are, however, incompatible
with thermally susceptible reactive groups such as active esters and
isothiocyanates. Compared to other, also chemoselective click chemistry
reactions, the iEDDA reaction requires no catalyst, proceeds at physiological
pH and ambient temperature, and most importantly exhibits exceptionally
fast reaction kinetics even at very low reactant concentrations as
usually applied in radiolabeling, rendering the iEDDA reaction an
almost ideal ligation technique in radiochemistry.

Thus, it
should also be ideally suited to introduce radiometal
nuclides into biomolecules such as proteins but also peptides by tetrazine-modified
chelators, and we intended to develop a DOTA–GA-based tetrazine
and assess its applicability to efficiently introduce 68Ga into TCO-modified peptidic ligands of varying complexity.

Synthesis of
DOTA–GA–Tz, TCO-Modified Peptide
Analogs and Their Conjugation Products
As the first step,
a 3-benzyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-modified analog of DOTA–GA (DOTA–GA–Tz, 3) was synthesized by the reaction of (4-(1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3-yl)phenyl)methylamine
formate (2) with DOTA–GA–anhydride (1) (Scheme 1) which opened—as expected27—quantitatively
to give the target chelator 3.

Reaction conditions: 1 (47.8 μmol), 2 (47.8 μmol), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (239 μmol),
dimethylformamide (DMF) (1 mL), ambient temperature (RT), 10 min,
yield: 44%.

An alternative approach towards 3, reacting tetra-tBu-DOTA–GA with 2 and deprotecting the
obtained intermediate tetra-tBu-DOTA–GA–tetrazine
with neat trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to the target chelator did not
yield the product but only resulted in a very fast and quantitative
fragmentation of the tetrazine.

As we assumed that the reaction
efficiency of the iEDDA reaction
might depend on the molecular complexity of the TCO-functionalized
peptide scaffold under radiolabeling conditions, we further synthesized
different TCO-derivatized peptidic structures as model compounds for
direct comparison of the labeling conditions and efficiencies following
one- and two-step labeling approaches.

For this purpose, we
synthesized two TCO-modified peptide monomers
of differing complexity as well as a TCO-modified peptide tetramer.
As peptide monomers, c(RGDfK) (4, binding to integrin
αvβ3 being, for e.g., overexpressed
during angiogenesis in tumor progression28) and PEG3–bombesin7–14 (PESIN), 5, being a peptide agonist binding to the gastrin-releasing
peptide receptor (GRPR) which is overexpressed in different malignancies
such as prostate cancer29) were synthesized
by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) methods22,30 and further modified with TCO in solution by reacting them with
(E)-cyclooct-4-ene p-nitrophenyl
ester 6 to give RGD–TCO (7) and PESIN–TCO
(8) (Scheme 2).18

Furthermore, we synthesized a TCO-modified peptide tetramer (neurotensin
analog-tetramer (NTanalog,4)–TCO (12)) as a structurally more complex model reaction partner for 3. 12 was obtained by tetramerization of a neurotensin
receptor-specific peptide (NTanalog–PEG3–Cys, 9, Scheme 3) on a dendritic, TCO-functionalized maleimide tetramer
scaffold (11, Scheme 4) (Scheme 5).

The neurotensin peptide
sequence chosen for multimerization, peptide
NTanalog, being a modified and stabilized variant of the
endogenous neurotensin peptide with the sequence (Pip)Gly–Pro–(PipAm)Gly–Arg–Pro–Tyr–Tle–Leu,
was shown before to efficiently bind to the neurotensin receptor type
1 which is overexpressed on different tumors and involved in tumor
growth, survival, and metastatic spread.31,32 As 4 and 5, 9 was synthesized
by standard SPPS methods (Scheme 3).

The dendritic, TCO-functionalized maleimide
tetramer scaffold (11) was obtained by a combination
of solid and liquid phase
syntheses (Scheme 4), first building the dendritic maleimide tetramer 10 on the solid phase and reacting it with TCO-active ester 6 at the lysine Nε amino functionality
to the TCO-modified maleimide tetramer 11.

The
TCO-modified maleimide tetramer 11 was further
reacted with the thiol-comprising neurotensin analog 9 under mild conditions via the Michael addition reaction, giving
the TCO-functionalized neurotensin analog-tetramer NTanalog,4 (12) in a moderate yield of 38% (Scheme 5).

In addition to the TCO-modified
peptides, also their conjugation
products with DOTA–GA–tetrazine 3 were
synthesized via the iEDDA reaction within 10 min to 2 h at ambient
temperature. Interestingly, the iEDDA reactions did not proceed comparably
fast in every case but the reaction time strongly depended on molecular
complexity. During the synthesis of 13, an excess of
only 1.5 equiv of 3 over 7 was applied but
the reaction was nevertheless complete within 10 min, whereas in the
case of reacting 3 with 12 to 15, an excess of 7 equiv was applied but the reaction still required
2 h until completion. Nevertheless, no formation of any side products
was observed during these reactions, giving only the respective conjugation
products in high yields of 67–95% (Scheme 6).

Radiochemistry
With the synthesized tetrazine-modified
DOTA–GA chelator 3, the TCO-modified peptides 7, 8, and 12 as well as the respective
DOTA–GA–peptide-conjugates 13–15, we proceeded in studying the reaction characteristics
of the iEDDA reaction in radiometal labeling of peptides, directly
comparing one- and two-step labeling (Figure 1). In the one-step labeling reaction, the
chelator–peptide conjugate is directly labeled with the radiometal.
In the two-step approach (which could find application in radiometal
labeling of susceptible biomolecules such as antibodies), the radiometal
is first incorporated into the chelator at elevated temperatures and
the formed radiometal complex, acting as the secondary labeling precursor,
is in the following reacted with the biomolecule.

The first
important question to be answered for the two-step radiolabeling reaction
was if DOTA–GA–Tz (3) shows a significant
decomposition under radiolabeling conditions—especially regarding
the elevated temperatures necessary for radiometal incorporation into
the chelator. To determine the thermal stability of DOTA–GA–Tz,
we reacted 3 with 68Ga as model radionuclide
using standard reaction conditions of 99 °C in slightly acidic,
aqueous, sodium acetate-buffered solution at pH 3.5–4.0 for
10 min. Under these conditions, only a slight decomposition of the
tetrazine of about 6% could be observed over a time span of 45 min
(Figure S1), a time frame which was described
to be sufficient for quantitative 89Zr-incorporation into
DOTA.15 This slight thermal instability
is, however, not critical for subsequent biomolecule labeling. Thus, 3 can be considered as sufficiently stable for radiometal
complexation even at high reaction temperatures and for two-step radiometal
labeling of peptides and other, more susceptible biomolecules.

In the following, we studied the radiolabeling of the model peptides
RGD–TCO, PESIN–TCO, and NTanalog,4–TCO
with 68Ga via the two-step labeling reaction. For this
purpose, 5 nmol of DOTA–GA–Tz (3) were
first reacted with 68Ga as described before within 10 min
at 99 °C and [68Ga]3 was obtained in
≥97% radiochemical yield (RCY) and purity (RCP) in molar activities
of 68–76 GBq/μmol starting from activities of 339–380
MBq of 68Ga. [68Ga]3 was reacted
via the iEDDA conjugation reaction with the TCO-modified peptides 7, 8, and 12 in equimolar amounts.

The results obtained in the iEDDA conjugation reactions were very
similar for the different peptides and besides the very fast formation
of the respective target peptide radioligands, the formation of three
different side products was also observed in analytical radio-HPLC
(high performance liquid chromatography). None of these side products was
identical to [68Ga]3 despite the similar retention
times (Figure 2A).

radio-HPLC signals of the reaction mixtures of the two-step
(A) and one-step (B) radiolabeling reactions towards the 68Ga-labeled peptides [68Ga]13–[68Ga]15. (A): The identical side products formed
during all radiolabeling reactions of [68Ga]3 with 7, 8, 12 and TCO–OH
(applied in equimolar amounts) at Rt of
1.39, 1.45, and 1.55 min are accentuated by the red box.

Interestingly, the three side products formed were
identical, irrespective
of which TCO–peptide, 7, 8, or 12, was used as the reaction partner for [68Ga]3 and were also formed by reacting [68Ga]3 with TCO–alcohol (Figure 2A). Thus, the formed side products were not
the result of, for e.g., fragmented conjugation products as otherwise,
they would exhibit strongly differing retention times depending on
the TCO-modified peptide used.

In comparison, the direct, one-step
labeling of the DOTA–GA-modified
peptides 13–15 yielded the radiolabeled
peptides in pure form (Figure 2B) without giving any of the before mentioned side products.
This confirms that these side products observed in the two-step process
were not the result of product degradation or isomerization. The products
[68Ga]13 and [68Ga]15 could be obtained by a one-step labeling approach within 10 min
at 99 °C using 5 nmol of precursor in ≥99% RCY and purity
and molar activities of 68–72 GBq/μmol starting from
activities of 340–358 MBq of 68Ga. 14 also showed a complete incorporation of the radiometal under the
same conditions (≥97%) but as well a significant thermal decomposition
of the radioligand (Figure 2B), being absent in the two-step labeling protocol where 8 was radiolabeled at ambient temperature with [68Ga]3 to [68Ga]14 (Figure 2A). This effect of thermal
lability of the BBN7–14 peptide sequence is in accordance
with own previous observations.

Taken together, the one-step
protocol unexpectedly yielded the
target radioligands in much higher RCY and purity than the two-step
protocol as in the two-step radiolabeling process, the formed side
products decreased RCYs and would necessitate further significant
purification steps of the target radiopeptides such as radio-HPLC
purification of the products and subsequent reformulation.

In
the following, we intended to determine the reason for the formation
of the mentioned side products of which the occurrence has not been
described before. The reason for this might lie in the application,
radiometal-labeled tetrazines are generally used for. Usually, these
secondary labeling precursors are used for in vivo or ex vivo antibody
modification which is not directly comparable to the labeling of peptides.
The labeling reaction of antibodies in vivo, for e.g., cannot be analyzed
with regard to chemical processes and formed products and in the case
of ex vivo labeling of antibodies, the reaction mixtures are rather
complex compared to the labeling of peptides, potentially masking
the formation of low molecular weight side products, especially, if—as
usually applied in antibody labeling—size-exclusion HPLC systems
are used for analysis of the reaction mixtures.

To determine
the reasons for the formation of the observed side
products—which were interestingly not detected during the cold
syntheses of the DOTA–GA–peptide conjugation products 13, 14, and 15—we first studied
different reaction volumes and pH values of the labeling solutions
to determine if these parameters influence the formation of the side
products, which was however not the case.

Assuming that the
side products might be formed as a result of
the ionizing conditions during the conjugation reactions with [68Ga]3, we added a 100-fold excess of ascorbic
acid or ethanol (acting as radical scavengers) to the reaction mixtures
which, however, also did not suppress or reduce the side product formation.

As we so far used equimolar amounts of [68Ga]3 and the peptidic precursors 7, 8, and 12 for the two-step labeling reactions, we tested if an excess
of TCO–peptide is able to suppress or reduce the formation
of the side products and found this assumption confirmed. The formation
of side products was less pronounced, the higher the excess of TCO-modified
peptide was during the iEDDA reaction (53.5, 39.2, and 30.3% using
1, 5, and 10 equiv of 12, respectively) (Figure S2).

This indicates that the formation
of the side products is a kinetically
driven process which can be reduced by offering a higher number of
reaction partners to [68Ga]3. Although the
formation of unintended products can be reduced by this procedure,
it cannot be completely suppressed, and furthermore, this approach
considerably decreases the achievable molar activity of the radiolabeled
peptides.

As the formation of the side products did not occur
under nonradioactive
conditions during the syntheses of the DOTA–GA–peptide
precursors 13–15 but was only observed
if [68Ga]3 was reacted with a TCO-comprising
compound (and thus, could also not be observed in radiolabeling solution
under iEDDA conjugation conditions when no TCO-modified reaction partner
was present), we intended to eliminate the eventuality of the Ga3+ ion being the reason for the formation of the side products.
For this purpose, we first synthesized the natGa–DOTA–GA–Tz
complex (16, Scheme S1) and
reacted it with the TCO-modified peptide derivatives 7, 8, and 12 to 17–19 (Scheme S1) to study if the
analogous side products as observed during the radioactive experiments
could be detected.

However, no formation of the corresponding
side products as observed
in the radioactive experiments using [68Ga]3 could be detected using the “cold” natGa-complex 16 for iEDDA-based conjugation to the TCO-modified peptides 7, 8, and 12 (Figure S3).

Thus, the radiometal ion in the [68Ga]3 complex was not the cause for the formation of
the observed side
products during the radiosyntheses of [68Ga]13–[68Ga]15.

In the following,
we tested further different reaction parameters
regarding their influence on the formation of the side products. At
first, we determined if the presence of certain amino acids can promote
the side product formation. For this purpose, we incubated [68Ga]3 with the endogenous GRPR-binding peptide bombesin
(Pyr–QRLGNQWAVGHLM–NH2) under the afore described
iEDDA reaction conditions used and detected—as assumed, as
the iEDDA reaction is highly chemoselective—no reaction between
both molecules, excluding the possibility that the amino acids of
the peptides interfere with the formation of the intended products
under radiolabeling conditions.

As the side products were only
formed during the radioactive experiments,
we further tested if uncomplexed 68Ga3+ is able
to interfere with product formation. For this purpose, we exemplarily
incubated 68Ga3+ with TCO–peptide 12 and tetrazine-amine 2. As expected, no chemical
reaction, and thus, also no formation of the side products could be
observed.

In the following, we studied if the 68Ga–DOTA-complex
itself (without an attached tetrazine moiety) is able to interfere
with any molecule part present during the labeling reactions. We thus
radiolabeled DOTA with 68Ga3+ under the same
conditions as used for the synthesis of [68Ga]3 and incubated the 68Ga–DOTA complex with 12, 2 and both molecules (12 and 2) together. As expected, no reaction of 68Ga–DOTA
with any of the substances present in the mixture or the formation
of radioactive side products could be found.

In a further attempt,
we repeated the experiments of radiometal
labeling of 3 and subsequent iEDDA-based conjugation
reaction to 7, 8, and 12 with
the radiometal 64Cu2+ instead of 68Ga3+ to determine if the same side products are formed
and thus, if the radiometal used makes any difference regarding side
product formation. For this purpose, 3 was first radiolabeled
with 64Cu under similar conditions as used for 68Ga-complexation (sodium acetate-buffered solution, pH 8.0, 99 °C,
10 min). [64Cu]3 was obtained in nonoptimized
molar activities of 4–5 GBq/μmol (due to the low amounts
of starting activity of 19–25 MBq of 64Cu2+ used), high RCY and RCP of ≥95% and found to be stable in
solution at ambient temperature for at least 20 h. [64Cu]3 was further reacted at first with equimolar amounts of 7, 8, and 12 for 5 min at ambient
temperature. The results obtained from these experiments are shown
in Figure 3 and also
demonstrate the formation of side products as observed during 68Ga-radiolabeling experiments.

[64Cu]3 and the TCO-bearing peptide derivatives 7, 8, and 12 (equimolar amounts).
The identical side products formed during all radiolabeling reactions
(Rt of 1.56 and 1.69 min) are accentuated
by the red box.

However, only two side
products were formed during 64Cu-labeling—instead
of three as in the case of 68Ga-labeling. As expected,
the retention times of these side products
(Rt of 1.56 and 1.69 min) differed from
those found during 68Ga-labeling (Rt of 1.39, 1.45, and 1.55 min). Confirming the results obtained
during the 68Ga-radiolabeling experiments, the amount of
the obtained side products could be reduced by applying a higher excess
of the respective TCO-modified peptide (Figure S4).

Finally, we intended to exclude the eventuality
that the chelator
DOTA–GA–Tz itself or the fact that it possesses more
carboxylic functionalities than necessary for stable complex formation
with 68Ga3+ (requiring only two of the four
carboxylic groups present in the chelator) and 64Cu2+ (also requiring only two of the four carboxylic groups for
complex formation) resulted in the appearance of the observed side
products.

For this purpose, we further synthesized a NODA–GA-based
tetrazine (NODA–GA–Tz, 20) by reacting
NODA–GA–NHS ester with tetrazine-amine 2. NODA–GA–Tz was radiolabeled with 68Ga3+ using standard reaction conditions of 45 °C in slightly
acidic, aqueous, sodium acetate-buffered solution at pH 3.5–4.0
for 10 min, leaving no redundant carboxylic functionality in the formed
complex. [68Ga]20 could be obtained in ≥95%
RCY and purity in molar activities of 63–72 GBq/μmol
starting from activities of 313–359 MBq of 68Ga.

[68Ga]20 was reacted via the iEDDA conjugation
reaction with the TCO-modified peptides 7, 8, and 12 in equimolar amounts and the results of these
conjugation reactions can be found in Figure 4. As can be seen, also in this experimental
setup, side products of different retention times as in the preceding
experiments were formed which were also identical for every TCO-modified
peptide used, being in accordance with the results obtained for [68Ga]3 and [64Cu]3. However,
using this combination of radionuclide and chelator, four different
side products were formed compared to three, using [68Ga]3 or two, using [64Cu]3.

[68Ga]20 and the TCO-bearing peptide derivatives 7, 8, and 12 (equimolar amounts).
The identical side products formed during all radiolabeling reactions
(Rt of 1.35, 1.47, 1.54, and 1.65 min)
are accentuated by the red box.

Taken together, the obtained results suggest that the radiometal
labeling of 3-benzyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-comprising DOTAG–GA
and NODA–GA chelators can efficiently be achieved using 68Ga3+ and 64Cu2+ and that
the tetrazine scaffold exhibits a sufficient stability even if high
temperatures are required for radiometal introduction.

Regarding
the iEDDA-based reaction of the tetrazine-comprising
radiometal complexes with TCO-modified peptides, some unexpected effects
were found: (i) Side products were formed which were specific for
the used radiometal nuclide and also for the used chelating agent.
(ii) The side products were however independent of the TCO-modified
peptide (with each TCO–peptide, the same side products were
formed in a similar proportion) and thus, cannot result from degradation,
isomerization, or rearrangement of the iEDDA conjugation products.
(iii) The formation seems to be a kinetically driven process as the
presence of an excess of the TCO-comprising reaction partners was
able to diminish—but not to completely suppress—the
formation of the side products. (iv) The observed side product formation
could only be found during the radiolabeling experiments, and not
in the case of identical, nonradioactive experiments; the radioactivity
itself was, however, not the elicitor of side product formation or
were the amino acids of the peptides involved. (v) The formation of
the side products was independent of the specific TCO-modified substance
used but only started if a TCO-comprising compound was present in
the mixture.

Determination of the chemical identity of the formed
side products
by conventional chemical analysis methods is unfortunately not possible
as their formation only occurred during the radiolabeling experiments,
and thus, in extremely low quantities, not even producing UV signals
in analytical HPLC. Thus, we can only speculate about what is the
reason for the observed effects.

One of the observed side products
seems to be identical to the
thermal degradation product which was—as described before—formed
to a low extent of about 2–5% upon radiometal incorporation
by the chelating agent (by heating to 99 °C for 10 min) (Figure S1).

Regarding the other one to
three side products observed (depending
on radiometal nuclide and chelating agent used), an explanation is
not that easily possible. Although it was described before that MeCN
reacts with tetrazines via the iEDDA reaction,21 this cannot be the reason for the formation of the side
products found here as otherwise, we would have observed the formation
of different side products, depending on if MeCN was present in the
reaction mixture or not. This was, however, not the case although
some reaction mixtures contained MeCN whereas others did not, depending
on the solubility of the respective TCO–peptide used.

Also, it was described that the conjugation products formed by
the iEDDA reaction can in some cases undergo oxidation to an aromatic
system (Figure 5A).
This can, however, not be the reason for our observed side products
as the retention times of these aromatized systems in analytical HPLC
were then depending on the respective TCO-comprising reaction partner
of the tetrazines applied, which was not the case.

Figure 5 Different possible side
reactions during iEDDA reactions. (A) Aromatization
of the conjugation product by oxidation. (B) Auto-aromatization of
the conjugation product by oxidation and simultaneous reduction of
a tetrazine educt molecule to 1,4-dihydro-tetrazine. (C) Click-and-release
reaction of tetrazine and 2-TCO–peptide impurity.

A more likely explanation for one of the other
side products formed
could be the formation of 1,4-dihydro-tetrazines from the starting
tetrazines as it was described before (Figure 5B).33 This assumption
also fits to the observation made that all of the detected side products
were not able to react with TCO-modified peptides. Furthermore, radiometal-labeled
1,4-dihydro-tetrazines can be expected to exhibit a similar retention
time in analytical radio-HPLC compared to their nonreduced tetrazine
counterparts, which is also in accordance with the observations made.

Furthermore, a contamination of the 4-TCO-modified compounds with
the respective 2-TCO-analogs might account for one of the side products
observed as these 2-TCO-analogs could react with the radiometal-labeled
tetrazines by the iEDDA reaction and release the respective peptide
amine by a so-called click-and-release reaction34,35 (Figure 5C). This
theory is, for e.g., able to explain why the retention time of the
respective side product is independent of the TCO–peptide used
(as this peptidic part of the molecule is cleaved during the release
reaction) or why it is not able to react with the radiometal-labeled
tetrazine chelator and shows a similar retention time than the latter.
However, it is not able to explain why the side products were not
observed under nonradioactive conditions (as the ratio between 2-TCO
and 4-TCO should be the same during the radioactive and the nonradioactive
experiments) or why different numbers of side products were formed
when using different chelators and radiometals.

Thus, the origin
of three of the found side products might be explainable.
The identity of the other side product (one more formed during the
iEDDA reaction between [68Ga]20 with 7, 8, and 12) can only be speculated
about but might be a result of radical formation of the formed 1,4-dihydro-tetrazines
under the ionizing reaction conditions present in the radiolabeling
reactions.

There is, however, no logical explanation why always
the same number
of side products should be formed using a certain chelator–radiometal-pair
which, however, differs from that of another chelator–radiometal-pair
used if in principle the same side reactions can occur during all
reactions.

The presented work, thus, shows limitations of the
iEDDA click
chemistry reaction in the two-step synthesis of radiopeptides, thus
being important for others working in the field of radiopeptide development.
The iEDDA reaction can be—as shown here—a valuable tool
to generate peptidic precursor molecules intended for direct, one-step
radiometal labeling but seems to be only of limited usefulness for
a two-step labeling approach using radiometal-labeled, tetrazine-comprising
secondary labeling precursors for peptide labeling due to the considerable
amount of side products formed, limiting RCYs and purities or achievable
molar activities of the target radiopeptides.

Conclusions
We showed here that 3-benzyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-comprising DOTA–GA
and NODA–GA chelators can efficiently be radiolabeled with 68Ga3+ and 64Cu2+. The resulting
secondary labeling precursors could be obtained in high RCYs and purities
as well as molar activities for further labeling of TCO-modified peptides
and exhibit a sufficient stability even if high temperatures are required
for radiometal incorporation. However, the following reaction of the
radiometal-labeled tetrazines with TCO-modified peptides unexpectedly
resulted in the formation of a significant amount of side products
which limits the overall achievable RCYs and purities as well as molar
activities of the target radiopeptides. In contrast, the corresponding
one-step radiolabeling protocol provided the target radioligands in
exceptionally high RCYs, purities, and molar activities.

These
findings provide important information regarding chemical
and radiochemical study design in the development of peptide-based
radiotracers using the iEDDA conjugation reaction.
