This paper deals with the innovation of the Czech colorimetric
biosensor Detehit designed for the simple, fast, and sensitive detection
of nerve agents. The innovation is based on the use of an indicator
consisting of a mixture of two triphenylmethane dyes, Guinea green
B and a basic fuchsin, on a glass nanofiber filter paper carrier.
The advantage of this solution is the blue–red color transition,
which is much more visible than the white–yellow transition
of other Detehit biosensors. The newly designed biosensor allows the
users to visually detect (with the naked eye) the presence of the
most significant paralytic substances (sarin, soman, cyclosarin, tabun,
VX) in water at concentrations of at least 0.001 μg/mL. This
biosensor design also enables one to detect these substances in air
or on contaminated surfaces.

1 Introduction
Neuromuscular blocking
substances have been the most important
group of nerve agents since World War II. Their toxic effect is based
on the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is involved
in nerve transmission via the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.1 The inhaled lethal concentration (LCt50) of these extremely toxic acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ranges
from 15 to 70 mg·min/m3; the oral lethal doses (LD50) of the most toxic of these substances are estimated to
be 5–10 mg.2,3 Although they are under strict
international supervision under the Chemical Weapons Convention, their
use is still topical. In particular, civil wars, terrorist attacks,
and particularly dangerous criminal acts pose a risk.4 Nerve agents are not only known as standard chemical ammunition
fillers but also toxic substances with the same mechanisms of effect
developed as chemical weapons in the past despite not being explicitly
monitored by the Chemical Weapons Convention. An example is the compound
known as Novichok, discussed in association with the Salisbury case.5

The analysis of the current state suggests
that the detection of
nerve agents/acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is still a highly topical
problem. The approach to the detection process may vary. It can be
based on the use of a variety of methods and procedures,6 but the main criteria are the aim and effectiveness
of detection. In practice, this means that, in addition to advanced
instrumental techniques, simple methods and technical means that require
minimal servicing and are low-cost, widely available, yet sufficiently
reliable are used. A significant part of these simple methods is based
on color reactions with a visual evaluation (naked eye): they can
be indicative papers, test strips, detection tubes, or pocket laboratories.7 It appears that, due to the extreme toxicity
of nerve agents with nerve-paralytic effects (on the order of 100
times that of sulfur yperite), it is necessary to use methods and
biosensors with a very sensitive enzymatic (cholinesterase) reaction.8

The cholinesterase reaction in simple colorimetric
biosensors is
based on the color indication of a product with suitable substrate
hydrolysis. The analyte concentration is then proportional to the
degree of the enzyme inhibition and the rate of the color change.
The first group of biosensors contains acetylcholine and butyrylcholine
substrates, which bond to choline and the corresponding acid, which
can be detected using a pH indicator. The second group, more widespread
nowadays, contains the substrates acetylthiocholine or butyrylthiocholine,
where thiocholine is formed instead of choline, changing the color
of the redox indicators, for example, Ellman’s reagent,9,10 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol11 or its
analogues,12 or triphenylmethane dyes such
as Guinea green B.13 The third group of
biosensors contains chromogenic substrates, such as 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenyl
acetate14 or indoxyl acetate,15 which hydrolyzes directly to form the dyed product.

The Czech Detehit biosensor is an example of a nerve agent biosensor,
which contains acetylcholinesterase (directly from a porcine brain),
acetylthiocholine, and the redox indicator Ellman’s reagent.16 The Detehit biosensor provides a white-yellow
color effect that can be difficult to see properly, especially under
low-light conditions. The authors previously proposed some form of
modification using filter paper made of glass nanofibers (as a substrate
and indicator carrier), which intensifies the intensity of the resulting
yellow color.17 The authors also proposed
a modified biosensor with a 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol indicator
with a blue–white color transition18 and a biosensor with a Guinea green B indicator with a green–white
transition.13

The authors of this
manuscript have recently published the results
of the development of a tubular detector (biosensor) of cholinesterase
inhibitors where the detector uses a mixture of two triphenylmethane
dyes, namely, Guinea green B and basic fuchsin, as the chromogenic
indicators.19 The purpose of introducing
a two-component reagent was to significantly enhance the color response
of the biosensor, indicated by the blue–red transition. This
paper presents the results of the experiments on the use of the mentioned
two-component indicator to innovate Detehit-type biosensors for the
detection of nerve agents with nerve-paralytic effects. The aim of
the experiments was to verify the design of the biosensor, its stability,
and its basic analytical properties, including detection limits.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characteristics of the Mixed Indicator
The idea of a mixed indicator as such is not new. One of the historically
most well-known mixed indicators is the so-called Votoček’s
reagent, with a composition close to that of the mixed indicator described
in this study.20 This indicator contains
a mixture of two triphenylmethane dyes, fuchsin and malachite green
(in a 3:1 wt. ratio), which, by the action of reducing agents (sulfites),
changes color more readily than the individual components of the reagent
when used alone. The idea of utilizing this synergistic effect also
influenced the design of a mixed indicator for the hydrolysis product
of the substrate during the cholinesterase reaction.

In the
experiments with mixtures of different triphenylmethane dyes with
significantly different λmax values, it was found
that a mixed indicator with a characteristic color (blue) is produced
under certain defined conditions (mutual ratio, pH). There is no discoloration,
but it turns into a product of a markedly different color (red). The
combination of GG (λmax = 620 nm) and FB (λmax = 540 nm) has been found to be the most advantageous mixture
and has been previously verified by the authors in the preparation
of a tubular biosensor (detection tube) for detecting cholinesterase
inhibitors.19 The diagram of the function
of this GG/FB indicator is shown in Figure 1. The course of the absorbance curves of
the GG/FB indicator measured at t = 0 and t = 10 min is shown in Figure 2a. As shown in Figure 2b, both components of the indicator are discolored
by the action of the hydrolytically released thiocholine, but this
gradient is significantly greater in GG.

the GG/FB indicator function.

curves
of the original indicator (t = 0) and after the change
in color (t = 10 min); (b) dependence of the absorbance
on time for the individual components. Photos taken by L. Matějovský.

2.2 Effect of the Reaction Conditions
2.2.1 Effect of the Carrier
The condition
for the good performances of the GG/FB indicator and, thus, of the
biosensor itself was a carrier with a sufficient amount of both components
to migrate during contact with the indicator fabric. Tests have shown
that glass nanofiber filter paper is well suited for this task (Figure 3). The transport
(migration) of FB is of critical importance. It has been shown that
its transport is about 2 times less effective in the commonly used
cellulose-based carriers than in glass nanofibers.

nanofiber filter paper before impregnation
(left) and after impregnation (right) with the substrate and GG/FB
indicator.

2.2.2 Effect of the Total Enzyme Activity
In the study of the analytical system in the liquid phase (for the
blank sample), it was confirmed that the decrease in absorbance of
the reaction product of the reduction of the mixed indicator (GG component
measurement) is a function of the total enzyme activity (Figure 4a). Figure 4b shows that, with certain
enzyme activity, the absorbance value (color intensity) corresponding
to the GG reduction rate decreases with time.

reaction time, and BuChE activity (620
nm wavelength, pH 7.5): (a) the effect of enzyme activity on the development
of absorbance over time; (b) the effect of reaction time on the dependence
of absorbance on enzyme activity.

2.2.3 Effect of pH
The influence of the
reaction’s medium pH on the function of the analytical system
was investigated. Obviously, this system works the most reliably in
an environment close to the physiological pH, that is, in the range
of 7.0–8.0.

2.2.4 Effect of the Incubation Time
We
analyzed the influence of the incubation time on the function of the
analytical system in the PHY samples. This effect is illustrated in Figure 5a, which shows that
the increased incubation time results in an increase in the detection
sensitivity—the GG discoloration rate increases. The graphs
may be interpreted to mean that the inhibition of PHY with a concentration
of 0.1 mg/mL and a 5 min incubation
period is approximately the same as that of PHY with a concentration
of 0.2 mg/mL and 2 min incubation period (a 2-fold decrease in the concentration = 2.5-fold
increase of the incubation period). The dependence of the absorbance
on the PHY concentration at a constant incubation time is illustrated
in Figure 5b.

of the incubation time and PHY concentration on the
stability GG/FB indicator color (BuChE 10 nkat/mL, pH 7.5, absorbance
620 nm); (b) the effect of the PHY concentration on the color change
(incubation period of 5 min).

2.3 Function of the Proposed Biosensor
The function of the proposed biosensor is illustrated in Figure 6a, which shows the
appearance of the indicator fabric after use of the blank (change
of the blue color to red) and a sample contaminated with an inhibitor
(the blue color does not change). The graph in Figure 6b shows the dependence of parameter a* on the reaction time for the blank sample. Parameter a* corresponds to the decrease in the green color (GG) and,
thus, the higher saturation of the red color of the GG/FB indicator.
The blue–red transition (visually assessed) is virtually completed
within 60 s.

Figure 6 (a) Function of the proposed biosensor; (b) course of
the change
in color of the indicator fabric (blank sample). Photo taken by L.
Matějovský.

The function of the proposed biosensor in the presence
of cholinesterase
inhibitors has been studied in more detail for PHY, for both lyophilized
enzymes (AChE, BuChE). It was confirmed that increasing the concentration
of the inhibitor decreases the green component of the dye in both
cases (Figure 7). Furthermore, Figure 8, for the examples
of PHY and DCP, shows that their ability to inhibit the enzyme increases
proportionally with an increase in concentration. However, it can
be seen from the comparison of the graphs that the enzymes were variously
sensitive to the used inhibitors. AChE was more sensitive to the carbamate
inhibitor PHY, while BuChE was more sensitive to the organophosphate
inhibitor DCP. This results from the chemical structure. Both enzymes
not only have different substrate specificities but generally also
exhibit partial differences between the affinities of individual inhibitors
for the catalytically active centers.1,2,21

fabric (incubation period of 2 min, measurement time 2 min): (a) PHY;

2.4 Limits of Detection
The evaluation
of the proposed biosensor was based on visual observation (naked eye)
of the complete change in color of the indicator zone (blue–red),
which depends on the concentration of the cholinesterase inhibitor
present. We have come to several conclusions when studying this dependence
in simulants, which are well in line with previous experimental data.
As shown in Figure 9, the BuChE biosensor was more sensitive to the presence of DCP (panel
(a)), while the biosensor with AChE was more responsive to PHY (panel
(b)).

indicator fabric with AChE or BuChE: (a) DCP; (b) PHY.

The limits of detection for real nerve agents in
water, determined
under the same conditions and the same assessment method (Sections 4.3 and 4.5), were less than 0.001 μg/mL. As shown
in Table 1, this concentration
provided 33 to 57% inhibitory activity (versus 25%). The biosensor
provided the best results with GF and GD; contrary to our expectations,
it was more sensitive to GA than to GB. The limits of detection for
all the tested nerve agents comply with the generally accepted water
safety requirements during emergencies (0.012 μg/mL for the
consumption of 5 L/day).22 The comparison
of the limits of detection of the biosensor with standard Detehit
biosensors and their previous modifications is provided in Table 2.

For safety reasons, the detection limits have not
been verified
using nerve agent samples in air, but based on long-term experience
with biosensors of this type, we may assume that they will be about
0.01 mg/m–3 and below (after a 60 s exposure); this
corresponds to acute exposures at AEGL-2 (8 h) for GA, GB, GD, and GF and AEGL-3
(for 1 h) for VX.23 The experimental results
enable us to provide some partial conclusions about the possibilities
of further increasing the sensitivity of the biosensor: reducing the
activity of the enzyme immobilized on the fabric, prolonging the exposure
time (up to 30 min), prolonging the incubation period, or modifying
the assessment method (including the objective measurement of the
color changes, for example, a tristimulus colorimeter).

2.5 Stability
2.5.1 Stability of the Immobilized Enzymes
The resistance of the individual types of enzymes immobilized on
a fabric to elevated temperatures was assessed as a part of accelerated
stability tests. As shown in Figure 10, at 60 °C, commercially available lyophilized
enzymes exhibited greater stability than AChE obtained directly from
brain tissue used in the Detehit biosensor. This difference in stability
was particularly apparent in testing with a duration range of 72–240
h.

Figure 10 Stability of the immobilized enzymes on the fabric exposed to 60
°C (Ellman’s reagent test – a*
characterizes the intensity of the yellow color, measured after 2
min on the tristimulus colorimeter).

2.5.2 Stability of the GG/FB Indicator and Substrates
Accelerated stability tests were also carried out with the GG/FB
indicator in combination with the substrates (ATChI, BuTChI). Both
base carriers, cellulose paper and glass nanofiber paper, were impregnated
with this substance (temperature 60 °C for 480 h). The initial
stability assessments were performed by tristimulus colorimetric measurement
of the changes in the original color of the impregnated carrier at
regular time intervals. As illustrated in the graphs in Figure 11, the glass nanofiber
paper samples exhibited significantly higher stability than the cellulose
paper samples. The combination of the GG/FB indicator with BuTChI
was the most stable. In further experiments, it was verified that
the stability can be further improved by decreasing the substrate
concentration and FB while maintaining a mutual weight ratio (Figure 12a). For comparison, Figure 12b shows the course
of the change in color of the paper from glass nanofibers impregnated
with the substrate and GG/FB indicator at room temperature. It can
be seen that, starting at day 90, the stability was virtually unchanged
or it changed minimally.

nanofiber paper
impregnated with 7 mmol/L substrate and GG/FB indicator (FB 140 mg/L)
at 60 °C, based on the change of ΔE.

paper
impregnated with 3.5 mmol/L substrate and GG/FB indicator (FB 60 mg/L),
based on parameter a* change: (a) 60 °C; (b)
room temperature.

The initial stability assessment was combined with
the analysis
of the behavior of the glass nanofiber carrier samples where the enzyme
(AChE, BuChE) was exposed to a high PHY. Some of the findings of this
study are illustrated in Figure 13. Both graphs (Figure 13a,b) show that parameter b* is virtually
the same, which may be interpreted that the concentration of the original
FB in the GG/FB indicator is virtually unchanged (minimal reduction
occurs). Conversely, the concentration of the original GG (parameter a*) changes significantly (reduction) depending on the testing
temperature (60 °C or normal laboratory temperature). It has
been confirmed that the GG/FB-impregnated glass nanofiber paper and
BuTChI, in combination with BuChE, provide the best results.

substrate, after 480 h, IV – half the concentration of the

3 Conclusions
The standard Detehit biosensor
for the detection of nerve agents
with nerve-paralytic effects improved using an indicator consisting
of a mixture of two triphenylmethane dyes (GG/FB indicator). The indicator
components are highly compatible and likely to have a synergic effect.
The reliable performance of the indicator is ensured by a special
glass nanofiber carrier. BuChE was preferred to run the enzymatic
reaction together with a compatible BuTChI substrate. Although the
importance of BuChE compared to AChE is not fully understood, its
use has a number of practical advantages: BuChE is not inhibited by
substrate excess as is typical for AChE, and the active center is
wider, excels in high stability, and thermal stability after immobilization
on the fabric. The biosensor allows for the rapid, simple, and robust
detection of these nerve agents at concentrations less than 0.001
μg/mL, with its distinctive blue–red color change (compared
to previous modifications), beneficial for visual evaluation (naked
eye). The results show that the newly developed GG/FB indicator biosensor
can enhance the quality of the in situ analysis of nerve agents, especially
in extreme field conditions. Concerning the dual-skinned GC/FB indicator
itself, it turns out that some complex detection problems do not have
to be solved by the time-consuming and cost-intensive synthesis of
new analytical reagents but can be achieved much more efficiently
by using existing indicators or mixtures thereof.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Equipment
Cellulose
filter paper with a specific gravity of 85 g/m2 (Whatman,
Kent, U.K.) and MN GF-5 glass nanofiber filter paper (Macherey-Nage,
Dueren, Germany) with a specific gravity of 85 g/m2 and
a thickness of 0.4 mm were used as the carriers for the substrate
and indicator. In addition, a white cellulose fabric with a specific
gravity of 173 g/m2 was used to immobilize the enzyme.
The following chemicals were used to impregnate the filter papers:
ethanol 99%, methanol 99% (both Penta, Prague, Czech Republic), redistilled
water, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman’s
reagent), Fuchsin Basic (FB, pararosaniline, C.I. 42500), Guinea green
B (GG, Acid Green 3, C.I. 42085), acetylthiocholine iodide (min. 99%,
ATChI), and butyrylthiocholine iodide (min. 99%, BuTChI) (all Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). Lyophilized enzymes butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)
and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from horse plasma (both Sigma-Aldrich)
with a declared activity of 0.1667 μkat/mg, followed by AChE
from animal brain tissue (Oritest, Prague, Czech Republic), were used
to impregnate the cellulose fabric. Corn dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) and
anionic surfactant C12–14 alcohol 7EO (Enaspol,
Velvěty, Czech Republic) were used to immobilize the enzyme
to the fabric. Buffer solutions were prepared using Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich).

Due to safety and hygiene reasons, the basic biosensor function
was tested with commonly used simulants, physostigmine (PHY) and diethylchlorophosphate
(DCP) (both Sigma-Aldrich). The results were verified using real samples
of nerve agents: sarin (GB), soman (GD), cyclosarin (GF), tabun (GA),
and VX (all from the Military Research Institute, Brno, Czech Republic).
The purity of nerve agents ranged between 88 and 92% as confirmed
by GC–MS. The chemical structures of the used simulants and
nerve agents are shown in Figure 14.

Figure 14 Chemical structures of the test substances.

Aquamate (Thermo Spectronic, Cambridge, U.K.) was
used for the
spectrophotometric measurement in the solutions. Tristimulus colorimetric
measurements were performed using an LMG 173 portable colorimeter
(Dr. Lange, Dusseldorf, Germany).

4.2 Biosensor Preparation
The biosensor
consisted of a plastic strip 10 cm long by 1 cm wide by 0.5 mm thick,
which was provided with an indicator fabric (1 cm2) with
immobilized enzymes at one end, and the fabric (1 cm2)
without the enzyme was used as a control. At the opposite end, the
biosensor was provided with a carrier (2 cm2) impregnated
with a mixed indicator (GG/FB indicator) and substrate. The design
allowed for the mechanical coupling of the opposite ends of the detector
so that the two fabrics were completely covered. A schematic diagram
of the construction of the biosensor including its use is shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15 (a) Biosensor schematic
diagram: 1 – plastic strip, 2 –
fabric with immobilized enzyme, 3 – control, 4 – substrate
carrier and indicator; (b) the direction of the connection of the
opposite ends of the biosensor; (c) the scheme of the transport of
the reagents from the paper to the fabric.

A solution containing an adequate amount of the
enzyme with a total
activity of 21 nkat/mL, 5% dextran, and 2% surfactant in the phosphate
buffer of pH 7.5 was used to impregnate the cellulose fabric.

The solution for impregnating the cellulose paper and the glass
nanofiber paper contained 60–140 mg/L FB, 1.4 g/L GG, 3.5–7
mmol/L ATChI or BuTChI, 60% ethanol (v/v), 30% methanol (v/v), and
10% water (v/v).

4.3 Method of the Detector Function Testing
The biosensor function was tested by wetting the indicator fabric
in water (blank) or in an aqueous solution with PHY at concentrations
of 0.001–100 μg/mL. After the exposure, the fabric was
allowed to rest for 60 s for the enzyme incubation. Afterward, the
opposite ends of the biosensor were connected together and pressed
firmly against each other for 30 s to allow sufficient transition
of the GG/FB indicator and substrate to the indicator fabric. The
change in color of the indicator fabric with the immobilized enzyme
was evaluated both visually (the naked eye) and by objective tristimulus
colorimeter measurements at regular time intervals for 10 min.

Tristimulus colorimetry is a type of reflective colorimetry (spectrophotometry)
based on the CIE-L*a*b* color system. In this system, L* represents the
neutral axis of brightness, a* is the chromatic green-red
axis (+a* red, −a* green),
and b* is the chromatic blue-yellow axis (+b* yellow, −b* blue). In practice,
ΔE, the color difference, is also used, which
is defined by the equation 1  where ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb* are
the differences between the individual L*, a*, and b* values of the standard and controlled
colors. The values on the a*, b*,
and ΔE axes were used as the analytical signals
in the study.

4.4 Method of Stability Testing
The stability
of the immobilized enzymes on the fabric and the stability of the
GG/FB indicator and the substrate on the carrier were quickly tested
in an oven at 60 °C. The performance of the enzyme fabric was
tested at 240 h time intervals with the detection paper impregnated
with a solution of 1.6 g/L Ellman’s reagent and 6 mmol/L substrate
(ATChI or BuTChI). The fabric sample was wetted with water and incubated
for 1 min, and a detection paper was put on the fabric for 30 s. If
the enzyme was functional, a yellow color was produced on the fabric,
the intensity of which was measured in 2 min using the tristimulus
colorimetry method.

The stability of the GG/FB indicator and
the substrate was tested at regular intervals for 480 h by measuring
the change in carrier surface color (rate of aging) by tristimulus
colorimetry. After 240 and 480 h, we tested the transport of the GC/FB
indicator and the substrate to the fabric, when the enzyme was inhibited
by the PHY solution, with a concentration of 100 μg/mL.

4.5 Method of Determining the Detection Limits
The detection limits were determined based on the inhibitory activity
(I) as a function of the nerve agent’s concentration.
The inhibitory activity was calculated using the formula 2  where T0 is the time of the color change in seconds corresponding
to the blank (T0 = 60 s) and T is the time in seconds corresponding to the color change in the
presence of the inhibitor. In view of the practical use of the biosensor,
especially in difficult field conditions, the inhibitory activity
was determined visually (naked eye). The detection limit corresponded
to an inhibitor concentration of at least 25% of the inhibitory activity
(I = ≥25%).

4.6 Spectrophotometric Measurement Procedures
The basic preliminary studies of the GG/FB indicator function were
performed in solutions using spectrophotometry. An aqueous solution
of BuChE with an enzyme activity of 45 nkat/mL, a solution of the BuTChI substrate in ethanol with a concentration
of 16 mg/mL, and a mixed indicator solution were used in the study.
The GG/FB indicator was prepared by dissolving the individual components
in 60% ethanol so that the FB content was 0.4 mg/mL and GG 2.6 mg/mL.

A phosphate buffer with pH 6.5–9.0
with the enzyme solution was mixed in the tube to give a final volume
of 2 mL, and the enzyme activity after the addition of the GG/FB indicator
and substrate was at the level of 2.0–20 nkat/mL. Then 0.2
mL of the substrate solution and 0.025 mL of the GG/FB indicator solution
were added to the tube. The absorbance values at 540 and 620 nm were
measured at regular intervals for 10 min after mixing.

In the
inhibitor test, a phosphate buffer with pH 7.5 was mixed
with the enzyme solution to get a total volume of 2 mL with an enzyme
activity of 10 nkat/mL. A solution of PHY in ethanol was added in
an amount so that the final concentration was in the range of 0.05–1
μg/mL. After incubation (2–5 min), 0.2 mL of the substrate solution and 0.025 mL of the GG/FB indicator
solution were added. The absorbance was then measured in the same
way as for the blank.
