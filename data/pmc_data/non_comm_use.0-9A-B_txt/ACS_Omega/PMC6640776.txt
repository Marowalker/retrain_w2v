Developing cheap, stable, and efficient electrocatalysts is of
extreme importance in the effort to replace noble metal electrocatalysts
for use in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution
reaction (OER). We report a three-dimensional self-supported Cu3P nanobush (NB) catalyst directly grown on a copper mesh via
a one-step method. This nanostructure exhibits a superior catalytic
activity of achieving a current density of 10 mA cm–2 at 120 mV and exhibits a long-term stability in acid solutions.
It shows a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec–1 and an onset
potential of −44 mV. This catalyst displays a good catalytic
activity in basic electrolytes, reaching a current density of 10 mA
cm–2 at the overpotential values of 252 and 380
mV for HER and OER, respectively. The bifunctional Cu3P
NB/Cu catalyst exhibits better catalytic performances than the Pt/C
and IrO2 catalysts in a two-electrode electrolyzer for
overall water splitting.

Introduction
Energy consumption and environmental pollution have aroused widespread
concern worldwide. It is essential to develop clean, environmentally
friendly, and sustainable energy sources to substitute fossil fuels,
owing to the accelerated depletion and global environmental concerns
connected with the burning of fossil fuels.1−3 Hydrogen is
considered to be one of the best candidates to replace fossil fuels.
Water electrolysis, consisting of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions
(HER and OER, respectively), is a very promising and sustainable approach
for energy conversion, storage, and utilization, such as in clean
hydrogen generation, rechargeable metal–air cells, and fuel
cells.4,5 Platinum-based catalysts are the high-efficiency
catalysts for HER, and Ir- or Ru-based compounds show the highest
activity for OER. The practical application of such catalysts is restricted
by the scarcity and expensiveness of noble metals, and this limitation
has encouraged great efforts to design and develop non-noble metal
catalysts with low price and outstanding catalytic performance for
HER and OER. In recent years, studies on highly active, earth-abundant
catalysts have revealed some kinds of alternative materials, such
as transition metal sulfides,6,7 carbides,8,9 nitrides,10,11 selenides,12,13 and even metal-free materials.14 In addition,
many non-noble metal catalysts grounded on the oxides/hydroxides of
cobalt,15,16 iron,17,18 nickel,19,20 copper,21,22 and carbon-based materials,23 have been studied for their availability as OER catalysts.

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are efficient and stable electrocatalysts
because of their low electrical resistance and good corrosion resistance.
In the past few years, innumerable efforts have been made in the preparation
of TMPs for their use as HER electrocatalysts, including MoP,24 CoP,25 Co2P,26 Ni5P4,27 and FeP.28 Recent
studies have shown that three-dimensional (3D) self-supported electrodes,
such as Ni5P4/Ni foil,29 Ni5P4–Ni2P/Ni foam,30 FeP NAs/Ti plate,31 WP NAs/CC,32 CoP NS arrays/Ti plate,33 and CoP NW/CC,34 exhibit
excellent HER catalytic performance when compared with the planar
electrodes. The structure of 3D self-supported electrodes has the
advantage of not requiring the use of a polymer binder between the
electrocatalysts and the electrodes, thereby avoiding covering of
the active sites and improving the catalytic performance.

Copper phosphide (Cu3P) is a type of special catalyst
that is usually applied in lithium batteries because of its high specific
capacitance and outstanding charge–discharge properties.35−37 The combination of Cu3P with another semiconductor or
a metal to form a heterojunction has been used in photocatalysis or
photoelectrocatalysis.38−40 Recent studies have shown that Cu3P is
an excellent electrocatalyst for use in HER.41,42 Herein, we adopted a one-step method for the synthesis of a Cu3P nanobush (NB) on commercial copper meshes, for its use as
bifunctional catalysts for efficient whole water decomposition. The
obtained 3D self-supported nanostructure exhibits a superior HER activity,
with an onset overpotential of −44 mV, a Tafel slope of 72
mV dec–1, and the corresponding overpotential of
120 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 in acidic
solutions. Most interestingly, Cu3P NB/Cu serves as an
active, cheap, and bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and OER in
basic solutions, thus making it a promising catalyst to split water
for energy conversion purposes.

Results and Discussion
The fabrication process of the Cu3P NB is illustrated
in Figure 1. Red P
and a copper mesh were heated to 450 °C for 30 min under an Ar
gas flow. The original amaranthine color of the pristine copper mesh
turned black after the phosphorization process, thus suggesting that
the surface of the copper mesh was converted into metal phosphides.
The micromorphological change was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Notably, the flexibility of the copper mesh was still maintained
after the phosphorization process.

Figure 1 Schematic of the preparation process of a Cu3P NB via
the phosphorization of a Cu mesh.

The influence of the phosphating temperature on the nanostructures
formed was first investigated, as shown in Figure 2a–d. Sparse nanowires were observed
on the Cu mesh at 420 °C. With the increase in temperature, the
NB was formed on the Cu mesh. The NB, which consisted of uniform nanowires
with diameters ranging from 500 nm to 1.3 μm and tens of micrometers
in length, was formed on a Cu mesh at 450 °C (Figure S1). The agglomeration of nanowires and bulk blocks
appeared at the higher temperatures of 550 and 650 °C, respectively.
A mechanism for the growth of Cu3P NB/Cu was proposed on
the basis of these observations. The solid red P was turned into vapor
when red phosphorus was heated to a certain temperature. The surface
of the Cu mesh was first phosphorized into a thin film, as confirmed
by SEM and elemental mapping analysis, as shown in Figure S2. Cu3P NB/Cu was sequentially formed on
this Cu3P film on the basis of the interactional crowding-out
mechanism.43 The electrochemical tests
in Figure 2e,f showed
that the product synthesized at 450 °C exhibited the most activity
for HER.

temperatures: (a) 420, (b) 450, (c) 550, and (d) 650 °C. Electrocatalytic
tests at different phosphating temperatures. (e) Polarization curves
and (f) Tafel plots.

The nanowire structures were further characterized using X-ray
diffraction (XRD). Figure 3a shows that all diffraction peaks are in accordance with
the hexagonal structure of Cu3P (PDF 02-1623). The diffraction
peaks at 28.7°, 36.2°, 39.3°, 41.8°, 45.0°,
46.5°, 47.3°, 52.5°, 53.8°, 56.7°, 59.1°,
66.7°, 69.5°, 72.0°, 73.3°, and 78.3° were
assigned to the planes of (111), (112), (202), (211), (300), (113),
(212), (220), (221), (311), (222), (223), (321), (410), (322), and
(314), respectively. The lack of other observable peaks indicated
that the as-synthesized Cu3P was a pure phase. The energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis displayed that the atomic ratio
of Cu and P was 3:1, thus further confirming the formation of the
Cu3P phase (Figure 3b). A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
image showed the distinct lattice fringes with interplanar distances
of 2.01 and 1.74 Å; these distances could be indexed to the (300)
and (220) planes of Cu3P, respectively (Figure 3c). The corresponding SAED
pattern also confirmed the polycrystalline structure of Cu3P, as shown in the inset of Figure 3c. Figure 3d exhibits the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
and the corresponding elemental mapping patterns of Cu and P for the
nanostructure, thus clearly demonstrating that the Cu and P elements
were uniformly distributed on the nanowire.

and (d) TEM image and the corresponding elemental mapping pattern.

The chemical states and compositions of individual elements in
the as-synthesized Cu3P NB/Cu were characterized by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Figure 4. Figure 4a indicates three peaks at approximately 932.9, 934.6,
and 944.6 eV for the Cu 2p3/2 energy level, which are attributed
to Cuδ+ in Cu3P, oxidized Cu species,
and the satellite of a Cu 2p3/2 peak, respectively. The
three peaks with high bonding energy appeared at 952.7, 954.5, and
962.8 eV for the Cu 2p1/2 energy level, which were attributed
to Cuδ+ in Cu3P, oxidized Cu species,
and the satellite of the Cu 2p1/2 peak, respectively.42,44Figure 4b shows double
peaks in the phosphorus region. The peak at 133.6 eV corresponds to
the oxidized phosphorus in the form of phosphate. The binding energy
of the peak at 129.7 eV is lower than that of red phosphorus at 130.2
eV.44 These results suggest that
charge transfer occurs between Cu and P, thus demonstrating that Cu
and P are positively charged and negatively charged, respectively,
in which Cu may act as the hydride-acceptor center and P may act as
the proton-acceptor center, which is similar to a hydrogenase.45−47

The electrocatalytic activity of Cu3P NB/Cu for HER
was tested in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a three-electrode
electrochemical configuration with a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference
electrode and a Pt foil as the counter electrode. Figure 5a shows the polarization curves
of these electrodes without iR correction. The onset
potential is the potential in which the current density is 1 mA cm–2.30 The onset potential
of Cu3P/Cu is −44 mV, whereas the onset potential
of Pt/C is close to 0 mV at a current density of 1 mA cm–2, thus suggesting a superior catalytic activity for HER. This electrode
required overpotentials of 117, 147, and 283 mV to achieve current
densities of 10, 20, and 100 mA cm–2, respectively.
Tafel plots in Figure 5b were obtained from the linear portion conformed to the Tafel equation
(η = a + b log j, where b is the Tafel slope and j is the current density). The Tafel slope of Pt/C is 30 mV dec–1, which was the same as previously reported values.48 Cu3P NB/Cu exhibited a Tafel slope
of 72 mV dec–1, thus indicating that the HER process
takes place via a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, and the electrochemical
desorption step (discharge step) is the rate-limiting step.26,49,50 By applying the extrapolation
method to the Tafel plot, the exchange current density of Cu3P NB/Cu was calculated to be 0.25 mA cm–2. These
parameters are comparable to or superior to the values from the recently
reported non-noble HER catalysts in acidic solutions (Table S1).

and (f) the Faraday resistance (Rct)-dependent
overpotential plot; the inset shows the linearity between the overpotential
and log(Rct–1).

The durability of Cu3P NB/Cu was investigated under
continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles with a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte over the potential range between −0.5
and 0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with a scan rate
of 100 mV s–1. Figure 5c shows a comparison of the polarization
curve before and after 1000 cycles. Only slight decreases in the current
density were observed after 1000 cycles, thus indicating that the
Cu3P NB/Cu electrode has an excellent cycle life in acidic
environments. The current density curve related to time under a static
overpotential of 150 mV suggested that the catalytic activity of the
as-synthesized Cu3P NB/Cu was maintained for at least 9
h, as shown in Figure 5d.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to identify
the interfacial properties and catalytic kinetics of the as-synthesized
Cu3P NB/Cu catalyst in the HER process. A Bode plot of
Cu3P revealed a typical one-time constant process in acidic
media, as shown in Figure S3.51,52 The experimental data were fitted using an equivalent circuit consisting
of a series resistance (Rs) with a parallel
resistance (Rct, CPE), in which Rs is the ohmic resistance mainly resulting from
the electrolyte and all contact resistances, and the time constant Rct-CPE illustrates Faraday resistance (Rct) at the interface between the nanostructures
and the electrolyte.30,52 The value of Rs is the same, but the value of Rct varies with different voltages, as shown in Figure 5e. The Rct-dependent overpotential curve was plotted, as shown in Figure 5f. The Tafel slope
is also obtained from the impedance data by plotting log(Rct–1) versus the overpotential (as shown
in the inset of Figure 5f), which is smaller than that obtained by fitting the linear regions
of Tafel plots in Figure 5b. The Tafel slope achieved in this method reflects only the
charge transfer kinetics without regarding the catalyst resistance.53

The electrocatalytic performance of Cu3P NB/Cu for HER
in 1.0 M KOH solution was further investigated. Commercial Pt/C catalysts
loaded on Cu mesh and bare Cu mesh were tested in control experiments.
A Cu3P NB/Cu electrode exhibited an onset potential of
121 mV and a Tafel slope of 150 mV dec–1. This electrode
required an overpotential of 252 mV to achieve 10 mA cm–2. This catalytic performance was better than the recently reported
non-noble catalysts in alkaline electrolytes (Table S2). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in Figure 6c showed a negligible
loss in the activity after 1000 cycles of CV scanning. The current
density curve related to time at 300 mV is also shown in the inset
of Figure 6c. These
tests demonstrated that Cu3P NB/Cu displays an excellent
stability and durability under alkaline conditions. EIS of the Cu3P NB/Cu electrode in Figure 6d revealed a low charge transfer resistance of 12 Ω,
indicating a fast charge transfer process in alkaline media.

Figure 6 (a) Polarization curves for HER, (b) Tafel plots, (c) polarization
curves before and after 1000 CV cycles (the inset shows the current
density curve related to time for Cu3P NB/Cu at 300 mV

for OER, and (f) polarization curves before and after 1000 CV cycles
(the inset shows the current density curve related to time for Cu3P NB/Cu at 420 mV for 10 h). All measurements were taken in
1.0 M KOH.

The OER performance of Cu3P NB/Cu in alkaline solutions
was further investigated in a three-electrode configuration by using
the commercial IrO2 and bare Cu mesh as controls. The LSV
curves are depicted in Figure 6e. The polarization curve of Cu3P NB/Cu showed
a wide and prominent anodic peak at 1.41 V before OER. This anodic
peak was ascribed to the oxidation of Cu in Cu3P NB/Cu
according to the SEM and XPS characterization results (Figures S5 and S6),54−56 thus indicating
that the metal oxide/hydroxide may be the active site for the OER.
The OER current density of Cu3P NB/Cu increased rapidly
and exceeded that of the commercial IrO2 at 1.60 V. The
onset overpotential of OER and the overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 were 320 and 380 mV obtained by scanning from 1.8 to 1.1 V to avoid
the oxidation peak, as shown in Figure S4. The catalytic performance was better than that of the reported
catalysts (Table S3). The stability of
the catalyst was also evaluated by performing CV sweeps between 1.2
and 1.8 V versus RHE in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. The polarization curves of Cu3P NB/Cu after 1000 CV
scanning compared with the initial one showed negligible current change,
as shown in Figure 6f. The current density of long-term electrochemical stability remained
90% after a continuous operation of 10 h at 420 mV in alkaline media,
as shown in the inset of Figure 6f. The Cu3P NB/Cu electrode exhibited a
robust catalytic activity for OER in a strong alkaline electrolyte.

A two-electrode configuration was constructed with Cu3P NB/Cu as both the anode and the cathode to determine its catalytic
activity for overall water splitting. The electrodes were first tested
separately in a three-electrode system to estimate their individual
performance in the relevant reactions, as shown in Figure 7b. The combination of Pt/C
and IrO2 was used as the benchmark catalyst for comparison.
The alkaline water electrolysis was then conducted with a two-electrode
setup. The Cu3P/Cu(+)//Cu3P/Cu(−) system
reached 10 and 20 mA cm–2 at cell voltages of only
1.85 and 1.94 V, respectively, which is close to Co3O4/TM//Co3O4/TM (1.82 V) and better than
CoxPO4/CoP (1.91 V), NiCo2O4/CC//NiCo2O4/CC (1.98 V),
and commercial electrolyzers (1.8–2.0 V).57−60 These results are superior to
the values of the IrO2(+)//Pt/C(−) catalyst. The
long-term electrochemical stability of the electrolyzer was operated
at a given overpotential of 1.88 V. The current density remained 93.8%
after a continuous operation of 12 h, as shown in Figure 7c, thus suggesting the superior
durability of Cu3P/Cu electrodes. The optical photograph
in Figure 7c shows
vigorous bubble accumulation and release on the two electrodes. Two
AA batteries were successfully used to drive the water splitting with
Cu3P NB/Cu as both the anode and the cathode, as shown
in Figure S7. Thus, Cu3P NB/Cu
is a good candidate bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting
in practical applications.

splitting. (b) Performance of the individual electrodes tested in
a three-electrode electrochemical cell setup. (c) Time-dependent current
density curve of Cu3P NB/Cu at 10 mA cm–2 and optical photograph of Cu3P NB/Cu for overall water

Conclusions
A Cu3P NB on the copper mesh was prepared through a
simple one-step method. The catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic
activity for overall water splitting as a bifunctional catalyst. The
excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the structure and
composition of the catalyst. The 3D nanostructure provides more active
sites, owing to the high specific surface area, and promotes gas production
and bubble release. Cu3P shows a good electrical conductivity
that decreases the resistance of the catalytic system. This low-cost,
stable Cu3P NB/Cu is directly used as a bifunctional catalyst
in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer for hydrogen and oxygen production.

Experimental Section
Materials
The Cu mesh was purchased from Anping Shuangpeng
Co., Ltd. (China). Red phosphorous (P) was obtained from Alfa Aesar
Chemicals Co., Ltd. (China). The hydrochloric acid (HCl) aqueous solution,
isopropanol, acetone, ethanol, potassium hydroxide (KOH), and sulfuric
acid (H2SO4) were obtained from Beijing Reagent
Co. (China), and these reagents were of analytical grade. The water
with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm–1 was used
in all experiments.

Preparation of Cu3P NB/Cu
The Cu mesh was
first cleaned by sonication in 4 M HCl for 10 min to get rid of the
surface oxide layer. The mesh was then sequentially washed with acetone,
ethanol, and deionized water and finally dried with nitrogen gas flow.
Typically, a piece of the Cu mesh and approximately 0.4 g of red P
were placed at two different locations of the tube furnace. The furnace
was purged with argon (Ar, 99.99%) for 30 min, heated to 450 °C
under the heating rate of 5 °C min–1, and then
maintained for 30 min at this temperature. Finally, the furnace was
naturally cooled down to ambient temperature. Argon was maintained
during the whole process. To investigate the impact of the phosphating
temperature on the electrocatalytic activity, the phosphorization
process was also conducted at 420, 550, and 650 °C, whereas the
other parameters remained unchanged.

Characterization
The structure was characterized
by XRD using a Bragg–Brentano diffractometer (D8-tools, Germany)
equipped with a Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm) emitting source.
Scanning electron microscope images were taken on a JSM-6700F field-emission
scanning electron microscope from JEOL Co., Japan. TEM, HRTEM, and
SAED were carried out using a JEM-2000EX instrument from JEOL Co.,
Japan. XPS was measured on an Escalab-250 instrument from Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA with a hemisphere detector and a monochromatic Al
Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV).

Electrochemical Measurements
All electrochemical tests
were performed with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. The performances
of HER and OER were carried out with a standard three-electrode system.
The Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt foil were the reference electrode and
the counter electrode, whereas the Cu3P NB/Cu sample was
the working electrode. In all measurements, all potentials mentioned
were recorded versus the RHE. To measure the HER activity of Cu3P NB/Cu in acid, the electrolyte was first purged by N2 (ultrahigh-grade purity) for 30 min to remove oxygen. LSV
was performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scan rate
of 2 mV s–1. EIS, used to determine the polarization
of HER, was conducted in potentiostatic mode from 100 000 to
0.01 Hz under the amplitude of 10 mV at different overpotentials.

To determine the OER activity of the Cu3P NB/Cu electrode
in 1.0 M KOH, the electrolyte was degassed by highly purified O2 for 30 min to ensure the saturation of the electrolyte. The
electrode was activated by 25 CV sweeps from 1.20 to 1.80 V versus
RHE in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. LSV
was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. Reverse
scans were carried out with CV over the potential range from 1.8 to
1.0 V at a constant scan rate of 5 mV s–1. The stability
was tested by CV between 1.2 and 1.8 V versus RHE.

Electrochemical measurements of overall water splitting were taken
with a two-electrode setup in a 1.0 M KOH solution with Cu3P NB/Cu electrodes as both the anode and the cathode.

A 20 wt % Pt/C (or IrO2) working electrode was prepared
on Cu mesh. First, 20 mg of 20 wt % Pt/C was dispersed in a mixed
solution consisting of 0.95 mL of distilled water and 50 μL
of Nafion solution (5 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) under 30 min of sonication.
Next, 20 μL of this dispersion was then loaded onto Cu mesh
and then dried at room temperature.
