Bacterial cellulose (BC) functionalized
with silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) is evaluated as an antimicrobial membrane for wound-healing
treatment. A facile green synthesis of silver nanoparticles inside
the porous three-dimensional weblike BC network has been obtained
by UV light irradiation. AgNPs were photochemically deposited onto
the BC gel network as well as they were chemically bonded to the cellulose
fiber surfaces. AgNPs with a narrow size distribution along with some
aggregates in the BC network were evidenced from the morphological
analyses. A highly crystalline nature of the BC membranes was observed
in X-ray diffraction measurements, and the presence of metallic silver
confirmed the photochemical reduction of Ag+ → Ag0 in Ag/BC composites. Antibacterial activity of the hybrid
composites, such as pellicles, performed against the Gram-negative
bacteria (Escherichia coli) by disk
diffusion and growth dynamics methods showed high bacteria-killing
performance. No significant amount of silver release was observed
from the Ag/BC pellicles even after a long soaking time. As composite
pellicles are preserved in a moist environment that also favors wound
recovery, by combining all of these properties the material could
be useful in wound-healing treatments.

Introduction
Bacteria-derived cellulose,
commonly known as bacterial cellulose
(BC), is produced by the fermentation of Gram-negative bacterium Acetobacter xylinum, which can produce high aspect
ratio nanofibers, with three-dimensional (3D) porous networks.1−5 BC does not require a complicated extraction process and harsh chemical
treatment while retaining the highest purity.4,6 Because
of its unique 3D weblike nanofibrous network structure, it shows excellent
mechanical properties and moldability, particularly in the wet form,
which make it suitable to be produced in a desired shape. Because
of its hydrophilic nature (99% of the constituents is water), flexibility,
nontoxicity, good biocompatibility, and wide availability it has been
extensively used in diverse fields from food and paper industry7,8 to biomedical applications, such as skin therapy, drug delivery,
regenerative medicine, artificial blood vessel, scaffold for tissue
engineering, and wound care products.5,6,9−11 Another advantage of BC is the
presence of a large amount of surface hydroxyl groups that makes it
suitable for functionalization with various nanomaterials, exploring
potential applications in various fields. BC is considered as a natural
wound dressing material thanks to its high porosity with a nanofibrous
network and higher water-retention capability, but BC itself does
not show any antimicrobial activity. Therefore, to make it applicable
in wound healing and to avoid secondary infection, it is advisable
to functionalize BC with some antimicrobial agent.

Silver, either
as nanoparticles (Ag0), oxides (mainly
Ag2O), or in ionic forms (Ag+) shows excellent
antibacterial activity.12−15 Since a long time it has been used as a broad-spectrum
antimicrobial agent against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Nowadays,
nanosilver is being used in many medical devices, including surgical
ones as well as a disinfectant against hospital wastewater, due to
its strong antibacterial activities.16−19 One of the advantageous properties
of silver over that of other microbial agents is its higher toxicity
to microorganisms while exhibiting lower toxicity to mammalian cells.20 Although there are some arguments on the toxicity
of the released silver ions against microorganisms,21,22 most of the studies suggest its safe use with a maximum permitted
dosage.22−26 However, in the case of a typical application like wound healing,
silver has to be retained inside a solid support to properly apply
over the affected area. Compared with common wound-treating materials
such as cotton gauges, BC having specific characteristics of high
porosity and water permeability is more favorable. For this reason,
there is an increasing interest toward producing Ag/BC hybrid materials
for antimicrobial treatments.27−30 As BC contains a significant amount of surface hydroxyl
groups, Ag+ ions could be easily attached to the BC nanofibrils
by chemical bonding, which could act as the seeds for the Ag reduction
process. There are several reported methods to prepare Ag/BC nanocomposites,
but most of them suffer from a prolonged synthesis process as well
as need harmful chemicals that in turn become the source of impurities
in the hybrid material itself. Photochemical reduction under UV radiation
is one of the most environment-friendly and fast reduction procedure
to produce Ag nanoparticles in the cellulosic matrix that has not
been explored much yet.31,32 In this article, we
report the fabrication of silver nanoparticles deposited on the nanofibrillated
BC (Ag/BC) by photochemical reduction process using UV radiation.
BC as well as Ag/BC hybrid composite formation were fully characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR),
and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) analyses,
and their antibacterial activity was investigated by the disk diffusion
method and growth curve method using a model Gram-negative bacteria.

Results
and Discussion
Ag/BC nanocomposite formation from Ag-impregnated
pure BC under
UV light irradiation is illustrated in Scheme 1. Ag+ ions were bonded to BC fibers
after impregnation and became Ag nanoparticles after exposure to UV
light, which is also evidenced by the color change of the composite
from colorless to amber. Three AgNO3 concentrations (10–2, 10–3, and 10–4 M) were used as the impregnation medium. The amount of silver loading
in Ag/BC composites was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) measurements and reported
in Figure S1 and Table S1. Upon increasing
the silver concentration, the color of Ag/BC also changed from light
gray to light amber to dark amber. Upon further increasing the silver
concentration, Ag/BC became blackish and any enhanced antibacterial
activity was not observed. As Ag/BC pellicles impregnated with 10–2 M AgNO3 showed the best antibacterial
activity (discussed in the related section) and further Ag increment
did not enhance the activity, all characterizations were performed
with this Ag concentration, and the composite is named as Ag/BC throughout
the article unless mentioned otherwise.

Nanoparticles Formation on the Nanofibrillated
Cellulose Matrix
Photographs of pellicles before
and after UV irradiation are also presented.

Figure 1 shows the
FTIR spectra of BC and silver nanoparticles-deposited BC composite
(Ag/BC). The broad vibration band at 3200–3400 cm–1 region is assigned to the OH stretching vibration of the hydroxyl
groups present in the BC network.2,33 Two relatively
smaller bands at 2800–2900 cm–1 and a strong
band at 1425 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching
vibrations of CH and CH2, respectively.2,34 The
absorption at 1158 cm–1 is coming from the C–O–C
stretching vibration of the pure cellulose matrix.33 A group of absorption peaks at the wavenumber region of
1200–900 cm–1 arise due to the C–O
and C–C stretching vibrations of the cellulose network.34 Relatively weaker peaks at lower wavenumbers
are the characteristics of the fibril cellulose network. The absence
of any vibrational band at 1387 cm–1 due to NO3– in the Ag/BC composite confirms the removal
of nitrates from the composite material.35

BC (Ag/BC) nanocomposite.

The crystallinity of BC and Ag/BC samples was evaluated from
XRD
analyses. Figure 2 shows
the evolution of broad angle XRD patterns recorded on both samples.
The appearance of strong diffraction peaks at 2θ of 14.4, 16.6,
22.6, 27.8, 29.3, and 46.2° can be attributed to the Miller indices
of the diffraction planes of (101), (111), (002), (130), (122), and
(412), respectively, of crystalline cellulose (JCPDS #03-0829).2,36 This set of diffraction planes corresponds to the highly crystalline
native cellulose I that is composed of Iα and Iβ allomorphs.2 It is noteworthy
that the Ag/BC composite retains a similar crystallinity even after
UV radiation exposure. The degree of crystallinity of the two samples
was estimated according to the empirical equation of calculating the
crystallinity index (CI) proposed by Segal et al.37  where I002 is
the principal diffraction peak at 2θ = 22.6° and Iam is the intensity of the amorphous counterpart
measured at 2θ = 18°. The estimated values are presented
in Table 1, wherein
more or less similar crystallinity is observed. The average crystallite
size of the nanocrystalline cellulose was estimated according to Scherrer’s
formula34  where L002 is
the average crystallite size, k is the shape factor
(0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength, and θ is the Bragg angle
corresponding to the intense (002) diffraction peak. The Ag/BC sample
shows some well-defined additional diffraction peaks at 38.1, 44.2,
64.4, and 76.7° due to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections
of the face-centered cubic metallic silver (JCPDS #76-1393), respectively,
confirming the presence of silver nanoparticles in the Ag/BC nanocomposite.
The other peaks at 32.2 and 54.7° due to (111) and (200) planes
of cubic Ag2O, respectively, and at 33.7° due to the
(100) plane of hexagonal Ag2O are also observed.38,39 The presence of Ag2O along with metallic silver is attributed
to the Ag+ → Ag0 reduction process under
UV radiation, as observed by the other researchers.40

Morphological analyses are
presented in Figure 3, which show FESEM images of the pure BC
and Ag/BC nanocomposites. Pure BC is composed of mainly 20–40
nm diameter cellulose nanofibers, forming a 3D weblike porous structure.
The nanometer-sized fibers are distributed and interconnected in such
a way so as to form a finely woven porous structure. This special
characteristic helps the silver ions to diffuse into the spongy structure
and distribute evenly through the material as well as along the cellulose
nanofiber surfaces. The silver nanoparticles, either as individual
particles or aggregates inside the cellulose matrix, are clearly visible
(Figure 3b–d).
To observe the distribution of the Ag nanoparticles more precisely,
the sample images were recorded in the back scattering mode (Figure 3c), wherein the bright
spots refer to Ag nanoparticles due to the strong back scattering
of the electrons because it has a higher atomic number compared to
that of the other constituents (O, H). It is observed that most of
the particles are attached to the fiber surfaces, whereas some of
them are trapped inside the matrix as agglomerates. The EDS elemental
mapping (Figure S2) showed quite a homogeneous
distribution of silver along the fibers on the BC surface. The scenario
is more clear with the cross-sectional analysis shown in Figure 3d, wherein individual
particles, about 5–12 nm in diameter, are clearly visible (marked
with red circles), which are attached on the surface of the cellulose
nanofiber.

focused at the surface, (c) SEM image along with back scattering measured
on the same spot, and (d) cross-sectional analyses. The insets of
(a) and (d) show higher magnification of the respective images.

The dynamics of the bacterial
growth in the culture medium was
investigated by placing three Ag/BC pellicles with three different
concentrations in a fixed amount of bacteria solution. The growth
was observed by measuring the optical density of the solution at 600
nm by optical spectrometry. The average value of the three consecutive
measurements from three independent samples of each concentration
was used to draw the graph. The data obtained from all samples are
presented in Figure 4a as a histogram. It can be observed that Ag/BC loaded with a higher
amount of silver shows strong antibacterial activity, wherein the
OD value remains almost similar even after 100 h of incubation, whereas
the bacterial growth is medium with a 10–3 M Ag/BC
sample showing moderate activity and the growth rate is a little lower
than that of the pure BC sample in the case of 10–4 M Ag/BC, exhibiting the lowest antibacterial activity. The dynamic
growth curve is presented in Figure 4b. From this analysis, the minimal Ag concentration
that could be loaded to the BC matrix can be determined, and further
experimentation was performed with the 10–2 M Ag/BC
sample. Further increasing of the Ag concentration did not enhance
the activity significantly, and at the same time it would blacken
the composite pellicles and might increase the silver release rate
from the sample that could limit its practical application toward
wound healing.

coli with incubation time, using three different concentrations
of Ag/BC composite membranes. OD600 represents the optical
density of the respective culture media. The error bar represents
the standard deviation (n = 3).

The disc diffusion method was adopted to further prove the
antibacterial
performance of Ag/BC composites, as the inhibition zone can be directly
measured, which is one of the popular methods to establish the antibacterial
activity. The photographs of Ag/BC pellicles with different Ag concentrations
are presented in Figure 5. The trend of the inhibition zone formation is analogous to the
dynamic growth curve, as we discussed before, in which the 10–2 M Ag/BC sample shows the highest level of activity.
The increasing silver concentration is also in accordance with the
color change of the respective composite samples. To measure the inhibition
zone, the best performing pellicle was cut into a circular disk of
about 10 mm in diameter along with pure BC serving as the reference
(Figure 5d,e). The
distance from the outer surface of Ag/BC to the bacterial colony-forming
zone could be measured to about 6.5 mm, which is good enough as an
antimicrobial substrate.

(d, e) Photographs taken with disk-shaped BC and Ag/BC at 10–2 M AgNO3 concentration to calculate the inhibition zone.

The releasing behavior of silver
from the antibacterial substrate
is an important issue because an excessive amount of silver release,
either as particles or in ionic form, could damage the human cells,
limiting its applicability. On the other hand, if silver is too strongly
embedded and not released, a poor antimicrobial activity will result. Figure 6 shows the amount
of silver released from the Ag/BC matrix as a function of immersion
time. It is interesting to notice that the maximum release happened
after 24 h of immersion, after which the concentration remained quite
fixed even after 7 days of immersion, as seen from the curve. The
counted value of Ag in mg/L is reported in a tabular form inside the
figure. This low release rate of silver from the BC pellicles could
be explained due to the strong attachment of the Ag particles to the
BC fiber surfaces as well as due to the agglomeration of the particles
that are trapped within the nanofibrillated network. The above result
also confirms the nontoxicity of the Ag/BC samples to human cells,40 ensuring their potential use in wound treatment
against bacterial and fungal growth.

of the immersion time.
The equivalent concentration of Ag in mg/L is calculated from the
parts per billion (ppb) value obtained directly from the inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) analysis.

As a summary, it can be said that the silver-functionalized
BC
composite prepared with a silver solution of 10–2 M (7–9 wt % of Ag with respect to cellulose) could be considered
as the limiting silver concentration in our case for achieving the
best antibacterial activity, without allowing the possibility of leaching
the silver into the treating media, thus offering the lowest possible
risk of contamination toward toxicity. A higher amount of silver loading
resulted in the blackening of the membranes and increased silver leaching
due to the silver nanoparticles being loosely bound to the BC fibers
even after washing with deionized water several times. Different workers
have postulated various amounts of silver loading in the cellulosic
materials ranging from 0.8 to 35.82 wt %, depending on the deposition/impregnation
method and the type of the substrates being used.5,6,27,28,42,43 In our case, the strong
binding of the Ag+ ions to the BC nanofibers in the impregnation
stage could result into this amount of silver loading that is comparable
to that in the previous works.6,42,43 The antibacterial activity of the Ag/BC composites was directly
determined by the formation of the zone of inhibition that directly
reflects the action of the antimicrobial agents. The inhibition zone
observed with the best performing sample well justifies the high bacteria-killing
activity of the Ag/BC composite, as observed by the other researchers.27,28,42,44 As we already discussed, pure BC is useful as a natural wound dressing
material because it can provide a highly moist environment due to
higher water-retention capability that prevents dehydration of tissues
and cell death, resulting in faster skin repair. But pure BC does
not show antibacterial activity to prevent infections in the affected
area. In our case as well, pure BC (control sample) did not show any
antibacterial activity where continuous bacterial growth (Figure 4a,b) and no zone
of inhibition were observed (Figure 5), whereas Ag/BC composites, even with very low amount
of Ag, showed good antimicrobial property. The mechanism of antibacterial
activity of silver nanoparticles is not fully understood and there
are ongoing debates in this issue.46 However,
in our case of Ag/BC composites, it could be said that in the moist
environment, contributed from both, the BC membrane and the wound
exudate, silver ions (Ag+) are released from the silver
nanoparticles that subsequently penetrate into the bacterial cells
and interact by damaging the cell membrane.3045,46 The silver-ion release is favored in our case thanks
to the porous channel of the fibrous BC membranes. This is confirmed
from the silver release data (Figure 6), wherein fast release of silver is observed in the
first 24 h time period. Now, compared with the silver functionalization
of BC, most of the previous works show either chemical reduction of
silver by using inorganic or organic reducing agents and/or the hydrothermal
reduction method, which are both time consuming and need rigorous
washing steps to remove the contaminants. As in our case, no other
reducing agents were used, there is no risk of chemical contamination,
and the Ag/BC composites could be safely used as wound-healing membranes
to fight against microorganisms.

Conclusions
Silver
nanoparticles sized from 5 to 12 nm, with narrow size distribution,
were successfully deposited on the BC matrix. The highly porous cellulose
pellicle, as a substrate, favored the diffusion of the silver ion
and the hydroxyl group-rich cellulose fiber surface accelerated the
deposition of ionic silver, which turned into metallic silver when
exposed to UV radiation. Silver nanoparticles are supposed to firmly
attach to the nanofibers because silver release was observed to be
very slow. The attachment of silver to the cellulose fibers was confirmed
by morphological analyses, although some aggregated nanoparticles
co-existed inside the void matrix. The minimum amount of silver loading
into the cellulose matrix with maximum antimicrobial activity was
evaluated by performing a series of bacterial killing tests. Ag/BC,
with optimal silver loading, showed the highest antibacterial activity,
with a strong killing rate even for a longer time period. The fixed
concentration of silver release after a certain period confirmed the
stability of the Ag nanoparticles inside the composite matrix, reducing
the risk of toxicity when applied to wound healing. As the composites
are very stable in a moist environment, which also may help the wound-healing
process, once prepared, they could be stored for a longer time period
and could be beneficial in general wound healing and surgical cases.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Black tea bags (Sir Bolton Company), sucrose
(commercial product), vinegar (commercial product), and Kombucha tea
were purchased from the local shops. Silver nitrate (AgNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and absolute ethanol (99.8%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further modification. Agar powder
was purchased from A.C.E.F., Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Miller), and E. coli were purchased from VWR.

Preparation
of Pure BC
BC pellicles were obtained from
Kombucha strains by the fermentation process of the sweetened black
tea with Acetobacter strains. The tea fungus that is composed of an
upper cellulosic pellicle and a lower liquid broth was activated every
2 weeks according to the procedure described by Chen and Liu, with
some modifications.41 The culture medium
was prepared by adding sucrose and tea bags to boiling water (1 L).
After removing the tea bags, the pH value of the broth was adjusted
to ∼3.0 by adding acetic acid. Finally, the cellulosic pellicle
pieces and liquid broth of the tea fungus were added to the cooled
tea broth. The fermentation process was carried out at room temperature
(28 °C) for 15 days in a static culture condition. New pellicles
of cellulose were grown on the surface of the broth. These pellicles
and the tea fungus were used to inoculate new fermentations. The pellicles
were washed with distilled water and boiled in 0.5 M NaOH solution.
To extract the endotoxin from the BC samples, they were placed in
a depyrogenated sample container and boiled with endotoxin free water
four times. At this stage, BC could be used for further experimentation.

Preparation of Ag/BC Nanocomposites
The purified BC
pellicles were cut into small pieces and soaked in three molar concentrations
of AgNO3 (10–2, 10–3, and 10–4 M) in a 100 mL glass beaker and left
overnight in a dark condition to make the Ag+ ions react
with the BC fibrils. An ethanol–water mixture (50/50 by weight
ratio) was used as the solvent. After impregnation, the BC pellicles
were irradiated with UV light (maximum radiation at 365 nm, 500 W,
Jelosil Srl) for 15 min. Then, the treated samples were washed thoroughly
with ethanol and distilled water, followed by autoclaving at 121 °C
for 10 min and finally stored in deionized water at 4 °C. For
morphological characterizations, the BC and Ag/BC pellicles were freeze-dried
to retain the 3D weblike structure.

Characterizations
The XRD pattern of the dried BC and
Ag/BC composites was recorded on a Panalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray
diffractometer, using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =
1.5406 Å), operating at 40 kV and 30 mA, with a step size of
0.02° and 5 s dwell time. FTIR were accumulated in the attenuated
total reflectance mode with a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One spectrometer
at a frequency range of 4000–400 cm–1, with
the resolution of 4 cm–1 and 32 scans for each sample.
TGA of the freeze-dried BC and Ag/BC composites were carried out to
with a Mettler thermoanalyzer (Mettler Toledo, Star system) at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min in nitrogen atmosphere. Morphological characterizations
of the samples were performed on a Zeiss (Sigma VP; Carl Zeiss, Germany)
FESEM. To perform the analyses, a thin slice was cut from the freeze-dried
cellulose with a sharp stainless steel blade and placed on the carbon
tape of the sample holder. The EDS analyses were performed with an
EVO 40XVP (Carl Zeiss, Germany) scanning electron microscope equipped
with a Bruker-made XFlash detector (SDD 5010; Bruker Nano Germany).

Silver Release Investigation
Silver-releasing test
from the Ag/BC pellicles were conducted in the distilled water at
room temperature (∼28 °C). To perform this test, the pellicles
were cut into 1 × 1 × 0.5 cm3 in size and kept
in a closed polypropylene container by adding 100 mL of distilled
water. Five ml aliquots were taken out from the container at time
intervals of 24, 48, 72, and 168 h, and equivalent amounts of water
were replaced in the container periodically to maintain the total
volume of the solution. The presence of silver in the water solution
and its quantitative analyses were performed by ICP emission spectrometry
(ES) on a Perkin-Elmer ICP-ES instrument. Prior to the analysis, the
ICP instrument was calibrated with the standard silver nitrate solution
of three known concentrations. The sample aliquots were digested with
a 1 wt % HCl/HNO3 mixture (1/1 by weight), and the acid
mixture was used as the blank sample. For each time period, three
successive measurements were performed from three different samples.

Antibacterial Activity Evaluation
The antibacterial
activity of Ag/BC pellicles was evaluated by the disk diffusion and
growth curve methods against E. coli as the model Gram-negative bacteria. The disk diffusion method was
performed on an LB nutrient medium solid agar petri dish. The silver
nanoparticle-impregnated BC was cut into a disk shape of 10 mm diameter
and sterilized with a low power UV lamp for 5 min, for each side.
Then, the disks were placed on the agar plate inoculated with 4.8
× 107 cfu/mL of E. coli. and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Silver-free BC pellicles
were also incubated under the same conditions as control. The antibacterial
activities of the samples were monitored by observing the inhibition
zone formed surrounding the pellicles. The inhibition zone length
was counted by averaging three independent experiments. In the growth
curve method, a culture of E. coli was
placed in the LB medium at 37 °C until the optical density (OD)
at 600 nm reached 0.6 (OD600). Ten microliters of E. coli (4.8 × 107 cfu/mL) suspension
was transferred in a test tube with an LB liquid medium, and a test
sample was kept inside the tube. The culture was held at 37 °C
for 16 h. The growth of the cells was determined by observing the
turbidity of the cell culture. The bacterial culture was withdrawn
from the tube and the OD value at 600 nm was measured by a spectrophotometer.
The experiments were performed in triplicate.
