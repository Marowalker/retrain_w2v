Steady development
on photophysical behaviors for a variety of
organic fluorophores inspired us to generate anthracene-based fluorescent
molecules with a strong acceptor and a significantly weak donor through
a π-spacer. Such molecules are found to have substantial twisted
conformational orientations in the solid state and enhanced apolar
character because of the attachment of tolyl or mesityl group with
an anthracenyl core. Upon exposure to a variety of solvents, strong
solvatochromism was noticed for 4-nitro compound (84 nm red shift)
in contrast to the cyano analogue (18 nm red shift). Both these probes
were highly emissive in apolar solvents while nitro-analogue, in particular,
could discriminate the solvents of ET(30)
(a measure of microscopic solvent polarity) ranging from 31 to 37.
Thus, 4-nitro compounds can be successfully employed to detect and
differentiate the apolar solvents. On the contrary, the 2-nitro analogue
is almost nonemissive for the same range of solvents perhaps because
of favorable excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer process.
The fundamental understanding of solvatochromic properties through
the formation of twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) state
is experimentally analyzed by synthesizing and studying the π-conjugates
linked to only benzene in place of nitro or cyanobenzene, which exhibits
no solvatochromism and that helped finding the possible emission,
originated from the locally excited state. Moreover, the molecular
structures for these compounds are determined by the single-crystal
X-ray diffraction studies to examine the change in emission properties
with molecular packing and alignment in the aggregated state. The
measurement of dihedral angles between the substituents and anthracenyl
core was helpful in finding the possible extent of electronic conjugations
within the system to decipher both solvatochromism and aggregation
enhanced emission (AEE)-behavior. The cyano analogue exhibited prominent
AEE-behavior, whereas nitro analogues showed the aggregation-caused
quenching effect. The reason behind such dissimilarity in solvatochromism
and AEE-behavior between cyano- and nitro-linked anthracenyl π-conjugates
are also addressed through experimental outcomes.

1 Introduction
Environment-sensitive
organic fluorophores are recognized as functional
materials because of their potential applications in chemosensing,
monitoring biological events, and finding unusual photophysical behaviors.1 The presence of strong electron push–pull
substituents to a fluorophore is a common practice to access solvatochromic
fluorophores2 through the formation of
intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state.3 The fluorophores with a combination of amine as a strong donor and
nitro/cyano/carbonyl as a strong electron acceptor are familiar in
the literature.1−4 The push–pull chromophores based on π-deficient nitrogen
heterocycles are also well-known for their strong solvatochromic behaviors.5 Typically, nitro functionality is known to quench
the fluorescence (Fl.) intensity with its direct attachment to the
fluorophore because of the efficient intersystem crossing6a and the photodecomposition of nitro compounds
through intra- or inter-molecular H-abstractions.6b Despite these common tendencies of nitroaromatics, many
fluorophores were identified to exhibit excellent quantum yield in
aprotic medium.6,7 With an aim of finding unusual
photophysical behavior, Konishi explored the solvatochromic fluorophores A–C (Figure 1), attached with a relatively weak donor and strong acceptor.8 The nitroaromatics A and B were reported to be strong fluorescent compounds where B, in particular, displayed dual Fl.9 Further,
a comparative study on the impact between cyano and nitro functionality
toward solvatochromism for a biphenyl system with a strong (amine)
donor was known in the literature studies4a,1b where the cyano group offered strong emission and solvent-dependence
in comparison to nitro.1b

Figure 1 Reported weak donor and
strong acceptor systems.

In the reported π-extended fluorene system (B, Figure 1), cyano
derivatives offered very high quantum yield with no Fl. solvatochromism,
whereas nitro exhibited unique solvatochromism with poor quantum yield.9a Notably, all these reported fluorophores A–C (Figure 1), were fluorescent only in polar solvents. However, investigations
on such weak donor and strong acceptor systems (Figure 1) are significantly limited in the literature
studies. With this background, we create and explore weak donor- and
strong acceptor-linked anthracene-based fluorophores that are synthesized
through a straightforward, inexpensive, and effective strategy. Notably,
anthracene is historically renowned as a valuable skeleton10 and solvatochromic fluorophore.11 On the basis of our recent research on π-conjugates,12 we have herein designed anthracene-based extensive
π-conjugates where toluene or mesitylene serves as a substantially
weak donor and nitro or cyano as a strong acceptor. Comparative photophysical
studies for nitro (1a–b, Scheme 1) and cyano (2) analogues are
performed to examine their Fl. solvatochromic properties. In contrast
to reported fluorophores A–C (Figure 1), the anthracenyl fluorophores,
described herein, are strongly emissive in apolar solvents. A range
of fluorescent colors was highly prominent in the naked eye under
a UV lamp (365 nm) for different solvents of ET(30) ranging from 31 to 37 and thus, could be discriminated
using this probe. Besides, our interest is to study the aggregation
enhanced emission (AEE) properties for these molecules although the
flat anthracene skeleton prefers to quench the Fl. intensity in the
aggregated state.10 In the literature studies,
anthracene was coupled with tetraphenylethylene to show strong aggregation-induced
emission (AIE) behavior13a and distyrylanthracene
was identified as AIE active molecules with potential applications.13b Recently, we reported 9- or 10-aryl-substituted
anthracenyl π-conjugates, and the AIE-properties were observed
in the presence of heteroaromatic moiety.12a Particularly, cyano group-containing AIE molecules were very well
studied.13c Thus, in this paper, the AIE-behaviors
for all these molecules are examined and compared between cyano- and
nitro-substituted π-conjugates. The effort has been made to
understand the origin of the differences in solvatochromism and the
AEE-behavior between nitro and cyano compounds. Isomeric nitro analogue
and a simple π-conjugate without nitro or cyano linkage are
also synthesized and inspected the photophysical properties to support
and explain our findings. The molecular structures for most of these
molecules are determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD)
studies, mainly to find the possible positions of the groups and the
torsion angles/bond distances. The molecular packings originated from
diverse intermolecular forces (supramolecular interactions) for such
crystalline substances are also investigated to interpret the emission
properties in the aggregated state.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of the Fluorophores
Our
recent research on an inexpensive synthesis of new arylated anthracenylphosphonates
using simple but effective Friedel–Crafts arylation reactions
made the accessibility of a variety of 9-arylanthracenyl phosphonates
much easier.11b Thus, integrating an aryl
group using expensive Pd/phosphine combinations is completely avoided.
Being suitable precursors, these phosphonates are successfully utilized
in the most inexpensive and efficient Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
reactions to afford all these conjugated fluorophores in ∼60–70%
yield (Scheme 1).

These compounds are characterized by 1H/13C
NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallographic studies were performed
for all these compounds to confirm the trans-geometry unequivocally
for such molecules. The trans-coupling could not be identified for
some of these molecules as the aromatic proton signals were merged
with the olefinic protons. In fact, the molecules 1a–b and 2 were synthesized initially and eventually other
analogues 3 and 4 were synthesized to compare
and study the emission properties of this class of molecules with
different substituents.

2.2 Photophysical Studies with
a Focus on Solvatochromic
Properties
Predominantly, the absorption and Fl. behaviors
for nitro compound 1a were studied at room temperature
in air under the environment of a wide range of typical solvents varying
from aprotic apolar (or slightly polar) [benzene, diethylether (DEE),
heptane, hexane, pentane, toluene, mesitylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, 1,4-dioxane], aprotic polar [acetone, acetonitrile,
tetrahydrofuran (THF)], polar protic (ethanol and water) to chlorinated
solvents (carbon tetrachloride and chloroform). The broad signals
on maximum absorption were with the range from λmax ≈ 396 to 403 nm, ascribed due to π–π*
transitions (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). Such a negligible solvent effect toward the absorption spectrum
for this molecule indicates that the ground electronic state for 1a remains unchanged on varying the solvent polarity. However,
the compound 1a started glowing under a UV lamp (365
nm) majorly in aforementioned aprotic apolar to slightly polar solvents.
The emission red shift with a change in the solvent polarity is significant.
The Fl. λmax varying from 508 nm (in pentane) to
588 nm (in acetone), that is, 80 nm red shift with a change in the
solvent polarity is noteworthy (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). Almost, no emission was observed in polar solvents
such as ethanol, water, acetonitrile, and chloroform medium. With
this solvatofluorochromic behavior of compound 1a, we
were curious to replace toluene with mesitylene with an aim to deal
with a compound having better accessibility, crystallinity, and Fl.
intensity. Hence, our newly developed methodology could afford compounds 1b and the cyano analogue 2 conveniently (Scheme 1). The photophysical
behaviors for both these compounds (1b and 2) were examined in the above-mentioned solvents, and the corresponding
data are summarized in Table 1 (for compounds 1a and others, please see Tables
S1–S3 in the Supporting Information). The absorption bands of compound 1b under different
solvent polarity have appeared as a broad signal in the range of λmax = 401–407 nm (Figure 2a), reflecting a very weak red shift. Notably, all
these compounds are poorly soluble in water. Thus, alike compound 1a, the sensitivity of absorption spectra on the solvent polarity
for compound 1b is very weak because the local environment
of the molecule in the ground and excited state remain unchanged during
the very fast (10–15 s) absorption process.14 In contrast, the emission spectrum of 1b displayed the solvatochromic effect very similar to 1a with the same range of solvents (Figure 2b). In the Fl. spectroscopy time scale, a
molecule can relax and feel the confined environment in the ground
and excited state and consequently, solvent effects on the Fl. for
some fluorophores are quite common.14 In
slightly polar or apolar aprotic medium both 1a–b fluoresced with more intensity as shown in Figures 2b and 3, although
the quantum yield (ΦF) for 1a was substantially
lower (19%, Table S1) than the compound 1b (50%, Table 1) in hexane.

c Absolute quantum yields were measured

Much higher quantum yield for 1b in comparison to 1a could be perhaps due to
restricted intramolecular motion
for sterically crowded mesitylene group along with the presence of
more methyl groups responsible for σ–π interaction,
a recent study by Konishi on pyrene system where pyrene fluorophores
showed enhanced Fl. on increasing the number of alkyl groups directly
attached to the pyrene core.15

The
fundamental understanding of the macroscopic property like
dipole moment for the solvents is inadequate to investigate such solvatochromic
behavior of this fluorophore. Hence, the concept of microscopic solvent
polarity ET(30)16 is quite realistic, from which the environment sensitivity at a
microscopic level has been considered. The probe 1b emitted
very intense bluish green in most apolar solvents like pentane, hexane,
and heptane [almost equal dipole moment (μD = 0)
and ET(30): 31], whereas CCl4 [μD = 0 and ET(30):
32.5] and mesitylene [μD = 0.047 and ET(30): 33.1] solution radiated discrete light green. Because
of the close polarity parameters for p-xylene [μD = 0.0 and ET(30): 33.5], the
probe also fluoresced in the same wavelength (λem: 535 nm) similar to CCl4 and mesitylene. The light green
turned into yellowish green (λem: 544 nm) in case
of o-xylene [μD = 0.62 and ET(30): 34.3] and DEE [μD =
1.3 and ET(30): 34.6] solutions. The probe
showed a light yellow Fl. in toluene [μD = 0.43 and ET(30): 33.9] but the emitted color was completely
changed in benzene [μD = 0.0 and ET(30): 34.5]. In relatively more polar solvent like 1,4-dioxane
[μD = 0.45 and ET(30):
36], the probe emitted a specific yellow color and faint reddish emission
was observed from THF solution [μD = 1.75 and ET(30): 37.4]. Thus, the normalized Fl. spectra
(Figure S3, Supporting Information) indicated
84 nm red shift with the nitroaromatic 1b and 80 nm red
shift with the 1a by increasing the polarity of the solvent.
As evident from Figure 3, this naked eye visualization using these new probes looks to be
suitable in distinguishing the apolar solvents in the range of ET(30) ≈ 31–37. So far, reported
fluorophores with weak donor and strong acceptor systems were fluorescent
only in the polar solvent, not in apolar solvents. The probes are
highly soluble in common organic solvents except for water and methanol
(poorly soluble) and highly stable in the solid and solution state,
indicating no chemical reactions with the solvent. It is noteworthy
that the fluorosolvatochromic property remained unchanged for the
compounds 1a–b even after 6 months, indicating
a highly photostable nature for these compounds in the solution state.

The quantum yields of the probe 1b in different solvents
are tabulated in Table 1 where pentane, hexane, and heptane showed the maximum quantum yield
∼50–53%, a notable quantum yield for nitroaromatic compounds.
Particularly, the quantum yield for weak donor and strong acceptor
systems (−NO2) were reported to be 35% maximum in
dimethylformamide.9a However, the quantum
yield of 1b has appeared to be very low in polar solvents.

Next, of interest to us is the compound 2, cyano analogue
of 1b. In an earlier report, the acceptor strength was
compared with nitro and cyano groups for a given fluorophore and the
effect was noteworthy.4 Notably, 1-cyano-5-methylaminonaphthalene
showed tremendous solvent-dependent properties,1b whereas no such effect is shown for the reported cyano
analogue of B (fluorene system, Figure 1). In fact, cyano analogues were less sensitive
to solvent polarities in comparison to nitro for a strong donor/acceptor
biphenyl system.4a,4b Thus, we were excited to see
the photophysical properties of compound 2 in numerous
solvents of various polarities. A structured absorbance band was observed
for this compound with absorption maximum with the range of 397 (heptane)
to 404 nm (water) reflecting an insignificant polarity effect on λmax (Figure S1b). This compound
was fluorescent in apolar solvents [ET(30): 31–36] with maximum quantum yield in heptane (35%, Table S2) and exhibited only 18 nm red shift
(Figure 4a) on polarity
changes, which was not enough to discriminate the apolar solvents
as observed for compounds 1a–b. Such moderate-to-weak
changes could not be detected through the naked eye under the handy
UV lamp (365 nm). Thus, the solvatochromic Fl. effect with the cyano
analogue 2 was not promising. Meanwhile, the synthesis
of compound 3 was planned to investigate whether the
change in the position of a nitro compound makes any difference in
the solvatochromic properties. However, this compound was somewhat
fluorescent specifically in hexane but nonemissive in the visible
region for all other solvents, exposed herein (see Figure S1c for absorption and Figure S2c for emission spectrum). Such nonfluorescent behavior for a different
system such as 2-nitrodiphenylpolyenes was identified before.6b The excited-state intramolecular/intermolecular
proton transfer for the molecule 3 might be responsible
for such a property. However, all these π-conjugates consist
of push–pull [donor−π–acceptor; (D−π–A)]
systems with different strength and orientation. Furthermore, we were
interested in the solvatochromic effect, if any, for the compound 4, a non push–pull system where nitro/cyanobenzene
is replaced with only benzene. The compound 4 displayed
the absorption maxima in the range of 392–402 nm (Figure S1d) and sharp emission spectra with λmax in the range 473–485 nm (Figure S2d) with a shift of 12 nm (Figure 4b) in various solvents of diverse polarity.

Figure 4 Normalized
emission spectrum of (a) 2 (18 nm shift)
and (b) 4 (12 nm shift) in different solvents. λex = 405 nm.

This compound was highly
fluorescent (see Table S3, Supporting Information) in most of the solvents,
particularly in DEE where the quantum yield was found to be 71%. However,
the solvatochromic effect was not encouraging as expected, but such
a system was used to understand the nature of the excited state for
this class of molecule.

Next, the effort was made to investigate
the reason for this variance
in the solvatochromic behavior between such nitro and cyano analogues.
The solvent effect on emission is often quite complex and depends
on many parameters.14 On the basis of the
literature studies3 and our experimental
observation, we anticipated the formation of internal charge-transfer
(ICT) state for such systems. More appropriately, these molecules
were presumed to have the rotation of groups on the excited state
(twisted molecular structure) and hence the formation of twisted internal
charge-transfer (TICT) state was expected. Wherever applicable, the
solvatochromic effect primarily is known to originate from TICT excited
state, and the change in the dipole moment between the ground and
excited state is also a crucial factor.3c To find the ground-state geometrical conformation for these molecules,
the molecular structures were determined using single-crystal XRD
studies (Figure 5),
and the molecular information was significantly decisive for such
systems to find the structural factors. Such studies disclose that
the mesitylene ring (87.63°, nearly orthogonal) and cyano groups
(44.46°) are significantly twisted from the anthracenyl and phenyl
rings, respectively, for the compound 2 while the nitro
analogue 1b has a comparatively much favorable situation
for electronic conjugations between the donor and acceptor units with
the torsion angle ∼76° between mesitylene/anthracene ring
and nitro group is twisted out of ring by an angle of 13.13°.

Figure 5 Molecular
structure of compound 1b (left) and 2 (right)
with important torsion angles (°); H’s
are omitted for the clarity.

Thus, molecular planarity for nitro compound 1b is
much more favorable than that of compound 2, resulting
in a much better electronic conjugations and charge separation for 1b. Therefore, on excitation, nitro compounds will possibly
have better charge separation within the molecule in comparison to
cyano analogues and such dissimilarity can induce the change in the
fluorosolvatochromic behavior. In fact, the less bulky nitro analogue 1a has even much better situation in terms of the co-planarity
with a p-tolyl ring (torsion angle with anthracenyl
ring ∼67°) (see Supporting Information Figure S4) and the nitro group (twisted only 7.88°). Further,
the C=C bond length changes of the styryl linker are found
to be interesting to compare ICT into the structures where C=C
bond lengths follow the trend 1b (1.323 Å) < 3(1.327 Å) < 2 (1.330 Å) < 4(1.332 Å). This trend also specifies more prominent
ICT for −nitro compounds in comparison to cyano. The reason
behind this variance in the molecular structures for 1a–b and 2 is likely to be governed primarily by the strong
electron-withdrawing effect of nitro group that assist the substituents
attaining the proper alignments to adjust the electronic conjugations
and other inter/intramolecular interactions. Further, the almost unchanged
wavelength for the maximum absorption at different polarity indicated
a negligible change in the ground-state conformations. Thus, these
molecules perhaps formed a conformationally different excited energy
state under different solvent medium and that brought the difference
in the emission properties. The strong emission in apolar solvents
[ET(30): 31–36] with higher quantum
yield for 1a–b can be attributed due to the energetically
and geometrically favorable radiative decay from the locally excited
(LE) state of the molecule. Upon increasing the polarity of the solvents,
the contributions from TICT states predominate and get stabilized.
The red-shifted emission with poor quantum yield is expected from
such a stabilized and geometrically different TICT state. On the other
hand, the cyano compound 2 radiates mostly from the LE
state and due to the lack of planarity between the donor and acceptor
unit with the anthracenyl core, formation and contribution from ICT
state are less significant. The crystal structure reveals a very strong
intermolecular C–N···H interaction (2.744 Å)
that can twist the cyano groups out of the plane by 44.46°. Such
interactions can also be present in some of the solvent media (mostly
polar), presumably responsible for lower quantum yield.

The
crystal structure of compound 3 (Figure 6) was very much helpful to
find the possible H-abstraction by the nitro functionality. In fact
the intramolecular distance between C–H···O
(NO2) was found to be 2.412 Å and it appeared to be
very strong bond (mostly covalent).6b

Figure 6 Molecular
structure of compound 3 (left) and 4 (right)
with important torsion angles (deg).

The −NO2 functionality also involves in
intermolecular
interactions with the hydrogen of the anthracenyl ring with the distance
of 2.621 Å. Both these C–H···O (NO2) distances would favor a strong interaction, resulting intramolecular/intermolecular
proton abstraction in the excited state,6b responsible for the nonfluorescent nature for most of the solvents.

Next, we were attentive to find out the difference in the dipole
moment between excited and ground state, being an important parameter
to decipher the solvatochromism. On the basis of the reported weak
donor- and strong acceptor-linked fluorophore,8,9 we
expected a larger dipole moment for the excited state in comparison
to the ground state for these molecules. In fact, significant increments
of Stokes shift by changing apolar to polar medium also indicate that
the emitting state’s dipole moment (μ) is more than the
ground state.18,19 Further, the differences in the
dipole moment between the excited and ground state were calculated
using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD)-DFT-studies
in the gaseous state and that showed a higher difference for 1b (1.67 D) than 2 (1.16 D) (see Table S4 for details). Subsequently, we also
found the variations of Stokes shift (Figure S5) and maximum emission wavelength (λmax) (Figure S6) with ET(30) and the plots suggested a very good correlation for 1a–b. The Figure S5 slopes comprise 287 cm–1 (1a) < 301 cm–1 (1b) ≫ 41 cm–1 (2) > 9 cm–1 (4) and Figure S6 slopes include 8 nm (1a) < 9 nm
(1b) ≫ 0.5 nm (2), which indicated
the favored fluorosolvatochromism for compounds 1a–b in comparison to 2. Moreover, these results also dictate
more pronounced TICT effect for 1a–b. Further,
the dependency of quantum yields with ET(30) (Figure S7) indicated the lowering
of the Fl. intensity being prominent for 1b. The compound 4 was considerably emissive in all of the solvents (Figure S7d). Thus, the fluorophores 1a–b with strong dipoles (becasue of the presence of nitro functionality)
exhibited the excellent potential to become sensitive toward the solvents
with ET(30) ranging from 31 to 37.4.

We have further examined the Fl. lifetime for these compounds in
several solvents of diverse polarity (Table 2, Figure S8).
Compounds 1a–b and 2 revealed a single
exponential decay in hexane, heptane, and DEE where compound 2 has a comparatively higher Fl. decay time. These results
also confirm that the emission originates from a single excited species.
In toluene, a biexponential decay with components ∼80% (B1′) and ∼20%
(B2′)
was found for compounds 1a–b, whereas compound 2 showed a single exponential decay. By increasing the solvent
polarity, compounds 1a–b showed a triexponential
decay in acetone where two minor components (3–9%) contributed
significant lifetime to the system (τ 1.16 and 4.34 ns), whereas
compound 2 had only biexponential decay with a trace
component (1%) of relatively long lifetime (τ 5.58 ns). With
the increase in the polarity of the environment, the lifetime was
reduced for both 1a–b and 2. It also
supports the reason behind the lowering of quantum yield on increasing
the solvent polarity. The other analogue 4 without any
push–pull system displayed a single exponential decay in all
of the solvents, which is very much consistent with our previous discussion
on solvatochromism. The longer lifetime (2–3 ns) did not even
decrease upon the enhancement of the solvent polarity for compound 4. Thus, for compound 4, only one excited state
(expected to be LE) with a single excited species is presumably functional
to emit the light while compounds 1a–b could emit
from the LE state in apolar environment while TICT states would be
gradually opened up on raising the polarity of the medium.

We believe that the LE and TICT
states are very close in energy
and the differences are roughly estimated to be ∼0.343 eV for 1a–b from the Fl. λmax at 510 nm in
hexane and at 594 nm in acetone. Such a difference between LE and
TICT state is found to be very small (0.08 eV) for 2 and
(0.06 eV) for 4. Finally, on the basis of these experimental
outcomes, we speculate that the Fl. emission of 1a–b occurs from the LE state for the apolar solvents, and on increasing
the polarity of the solvent, the TICT state activates gradually to
produce a red-shifted emission with poor quantum yield. The broad
emission spectra also suggest the possible existence of both LE and
TICT states together; however, no such prominent dual emission was
noticed. In such cases, both the emissions are probably merged, leading
to the broad emission. In this context, we have attempted to find
the contribution of LE and CT states for the fluorophores in various
solvents by considering the emission λmax = 476 nm
for non-ICT compound 4, where Fl. originates from the
state (LE) responsible for normal Fl.20 A detailed scrutiny on the absorption spectra of compound 1b (see Figure S1′ in the Supporting Information) revealed a noticeable variation with solvent polarity
starting with extremely apolar pentane to polar water. The absorption
spectrum in pentane shows a single peak at ∼400 nm, which might
be corresponding to the ground to LE transition. The absorption spectra
in polar solvents appear to contain signatures of more than one transition.
The appearance of a hump ∼440 nm in addition to the main absorption
band at ∼400 nm, as the solvent polarity is gradually increased
is probably indicative of a ground to CT transition. The steady-state
emission spectra (Figure 2b) give an indication of dual emission in polar solvents.
A simple deconstruction of the emission spectra can be achieved by
a double Gaussian function of the form  

The two Gaussians are centered at x1 nm
and x2 nm representing, respectively,
the LE and CT emission peaks, the values of which are obtained from
the position of the main emission band in purely apolar (heptane)
and polar (acetone). During fitting, the position of the LE peak is
kept fixed at 474 nm [explanation with 4], whereas the
position for the CT peak is kept floating. The position and width
of the LE peak is ascertained from the emission band of compound 4 in heptane, where there is no ICT state. Following our expectations,
no solvatochromism is observed in the emission spectra of compound 4 (Figure S2d). The fitting results
(Table S8) show red shift of the CT emission
peak as the solvent polarity is increased. In solvent with ET(30) 31.1, the contribution of the LE state
to the emission spectrum is ∼50%, whereas in solvent with ET(30) > 34 emission is predominantly obtained
from the CT state, with almost negligible LE contribution. The maximum
Fl. shift induced by increasing solvent polarity observed in the compound
is 84 nm. Assuming that the width of the LE state Gaussian component
is not varying with solvent polarity, it is kept fixed while that
of the CT state is floated during the fit. Table S8 gives a summary of the fitting parameters and Figure 7a shows the variation in the
weightage of the LE state in the emission spectrum as the solvent
polarity is varied progressively. Figure 7b shows the corrected emission spectra of
the compound 2 in pentane and THF along with the fitted
lines and that almost overlap the experimentally obtained spectra,
validating our fittings to a larger extent.

2.3 Emission
Studies in Heptane–Acetone
and Heptane–Methanol Environments
We were interested
to find the effect of Fl. intensity and the λmax change
in a mixture of polar solvent (acetone) and apolar solvent (heptane).
Upon incremental addition (see Figure 8a) of acetone to a heptane solution of 1b, a substantial bathochromic shift of 55 nm (till fraction of acetone fa = 25%) was observed in the emission spectra
with a diminution in Fl. intensity. This observation can be attributed
due to the shift in the excited state from higher energy LE to lower
energy TICT state upon gradual addition of acetone due to the polarity
orientation change of molecules in these two different solvents with
diverse polarity. Although the above experiment was repeated with
more polar protic solvent methanol (Figure 8b), a mild bathochromic shift of 7 nm was
observed with drastic Fl. quenching even with 1% methanol (fm v/v %). In fact, 25% methanol completely quenched
the Fl. intensity of the probe. As there is no such shift in the λmax, the strong supramolecular interaction between O-atom of
nitro and −OH functionality has perhaps quenched
the Fl. intensity. Thus, the presence of such polar solvents can be
easily quantitatively estimated using this probe.

in acetone fractions with shift from
505 to 560 nm. (b) Emission spectra of 1b (10–5 M) with increase in MeOH fractions with shift from 506 to 513 nm.
λex = 405 nm.

2.4 AEE-Studies
Inspired by the recent
development of new small anthracenyl π-conjugate-based AIEgens,21 AIE behaviors for these molecules are tested.
Earlier, we found that the presence of heterocycle played a role to
make such molecules AEE-active.12a However,
it is not essential on well-explored distyrylanthracenyl-based AIEgens
because of highly twisted molecular orientation in the aggregated
state.21 Hence, being sterically hindered,
compounds 1b and 2 were specifically checked
if they exhibit such AEE-behavior. Thus, to confirm a compound whether
AEE active or not, Fl. studies were carried out by gradual addition
of water (a bad solvent in terms of solubility) to acetonitrile solution
of compounds 1b (Figure S9b) and 2 (Figure 9). The selection of acetonitrile can be accounted for its
water-miscible properties and relatively less Fl. intensity under
this environment. Upon gradual addition of water, the molecules started
forming aggregates in the solution and the corresponding absorption
and emission spectra were systematically studied, where the Fl. intensity
was boosted to only compound 2 as shown in Figure 9. The Fl. intensity started
increasing when a fraction of water (fw, v/v %) is higher than 60% and reached to maximum if fw = 80%. Like many other cases, the attenuation of Fl.
intensity occurs upon further increments of fw.22 In the absorption spectra,
the molecular form (00% water) of compound 2 exhibited
an absorption maximum at 398 nm (Figure S9). We kept increasing the water content and measured both the absorption
(Figure S9) and emission spectra (Figure 9).

Figure 9 (a) Emission spectrum
of 2 (10–5 M) with different fw in MeCN (b) plot
showing Fl. intensity at different fw (v/v
%).

The aggregated form (80, 90, and
99%) exhibited the absorption
maximum at 404 nm, with a mild red shift of 6 nm (Figure S9). In the emission spectra, the emission maximum
of the molecular form was observed at 504 nm. On aggregation, the
emission maximum was slightly red-shifted to 508 nm with ∼ninefold
increment of Fl. intensity. Further, to support the AEE phenomenon,
quantum yields (Φf) were estimated and that was found
to be enhanced upon aggregate formation [Φf = 2.8%
(fw = 0%); 26.3% (fw = 80%), Table S9]. However, such
enhancement in the Fl. intensity was not observed for nitro analogues
(1a–b) and compound 4. The nonfluorescent
nature of these fluorophores in acetonitrile could partly be due to
the relaxed excited state in such polar environment and also free
ultrafast intramolecular rotation (in the range of picosecond) that
quench the Fl. intensity.21a To find the
polarity effect behind this Fl. intensity enhancement, we replace
water with methanol, where we found the lowering of Fl. intensity
till methanol fraction (fm) = 50% and
almost negligible enhancement of Fl. intensity was noticed by increasing fm = 100% (Figure S10). The main origin for such AEE-behavior was established by various
methods in the literature studies where restricted intramolecular
motion plays a crucial role.13,21 Therefore, we have
measured the Fl. intensity in a viscous medium by mixing a different
fraction of glycerol (fg) with a methanolic
solution of compound 2. The Fl. intensity was found to
be heightened upon increasing fg (Figure S11), which support the fact of Fl. enhancement
for compound 2 due to the restricted intramolecular motion.
The average particle size of the aggregates for fw = 80% was measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS, Figure S12) method and that appeared to be ∼155
nm. Thus, this particle size on aggregate formation is very much comparable
to the earlier reported AIEgens.13c

Next, the difference in the AEE behavior between cyano and nitro
analogues were attempted to address by analyzing the molecular structures
for both 1b and 2. Before starting with
the molecular structure analysis, we have taken the powder XRD data
for the aggregate (fw = 80%) which had
a few identical intense peaks as obtained from the crystalline sample
(Figure S13). Thus, the aggregate may exhibit
similar molecular interactions as obtained from the crystalline state.
Consequently, the supramolecular interactions (Figure 10) on molecular structure 2 are
analyzed where the cyano group interacts with the peripheral hydrogen
atom of neighboring molecules, specifically anthracenyl hydrogen.
This C–H···N hydrogen bond distance 2.744 Å
is quite strong and plays a substantial role in forming the supramolecular
network that also may cause the twisting structure for this molecule
upon aggregation. Even there are significant CH···π
(2.709 and 2.871 Å) and CH···H (2.310 Å)
interactions observed for this cyano molecule (four types of interactions).

Figure 10 Supramolecular
interactions along with significant torsion angles
(°) and distances (Å) for 2.

Such a molecular network will also restrict the
rotation around
the vinyl moiety. In particular, the twisted molecular structure is
proved to enhance the Fl. intensity by opening the radiative channels.
The π···π interactions that bring the molecules
to close are also suppressed for this aggregate. The measured dihedral
angles also specified the twisted molecule structure. The nitro compound
showed comparatively more supramolecular interactions (eleven types
of interactions, Figure 11) with better planarity. The nitro compound had CH···π
(2.796 Å) and CH···H (2.198 Å) interactions
along with many other interactions and interestingly, a four-membered
(N–O···N–O···; 3.006 Å,
apart from N–O···H; 2.61 and 2.712 Å) ring
was formed (yellow circle in Figure 11), and all these interactions possibly favor the relaxation
of molecules to the ground state in a nonradiative pathway. Also,
the twisted structure for 2 has higher centroid···centroid
distance (8.596 Å, Figure 10) in comparison to the nitro analogue 1b (8.033 Å; Figure 11), suggesting a relatively disfavored situation for the intermolecular
π···π interactions. Thus, apart from polarity
induced Fl. quenching, compound 1b has relatively more
intermolecular interactions that could also be responsible for being
nonfluorescent in the aggregated state.

Figure 11 Supramolecular interactions
along with significant torsion angles
(°) and distances (Å) for compounds 1b.

Further, Fl. decay dynamics (Figure S14, Table S10) were studied for the compound 2 which relaxed from
the excited state via biexponential manner
where 99% molecules had lifetime 0.38 ns and 1% molecules are with
5.58 ns, causing weak fluorescent in acetonitrile (average lifetime
0.43 ns). By adding water to this acetonitrile solution (fw = 80%), the molecules began relaxing in two channels
with lifetime 0.58 ns (for 24% molecules) and 1.96 ns (for 76% molecules).
Thus, the average lifetime of the molecules was almost fourfold increased
(1.63 ns) in fw = 80% and support the
Fl. enhancement in the aggregated state.

3 Conclusions
Four anthracenyl π-conjugates linked with a weak donor and
strong acceptor are conveniently synthesized in a conventional but
effective synthetic route. All these molecules were unambiguously
characterized by single-crystal XRD studies which were very much necessary
to explain the observed dissimilarities of the molecules in both fluorosolvatochromic
and AEE behaviors. The nitro analogues with ∼50% quantum yield
in aliphatic alkanes (pentane, hexane, and heptane) were proved to
be potential candidates for detecting the apolar solvents within ET(30): 31–37 while cyano analogues could
not. It was found that these nitro compounds are highly photostable.
The solvatochromic properties remained unchanged even after 6
months for the same set of solution. The difference in solvatochromic
behavior between cyano and nitro analogues is explained by examining
their geometrical pattern that depicts the extent of conjugation within
the molecules. The comparative studies were also conducted by synthesizing
anthracenyl π-conjugates attached with 2-nitro (3) or only benzyl (4) groups to understand the electronic
effect on these molecules, which also helped us to understand the
contribution of LE and ICT states as an origin of Fl. for these molecules.
The dissimilarity in exhibiting AEE-behavior between cyano and nitro
is demonstrated by comparing the intermolecular interactions in the
aggregated state. Thus, such probes would be potential candidates
to differentiate the apolar solvents and much smaller anthracenyl
conjugates can also serve as AEEgens.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 General Consideration: Reagents
All
experiments were carried out in hot air oven-dried glassware under
nitrogen and argon atmosphere. Diethyl (anthracen-9-yl(hydroxy)methyl)phosphonate
was prepared in our laboratory using the recently published procedure.12b All aldehydes were purchased from Aldrich and
Alfa-Aesar. KOtBu was purchased from Aldrich
and used as received. THF was redistilled from sodium metal and benzophenone
mixture. All other reagents were purchased from common suppliers and
used without further purification. Column and flash chromatography
were performed by using silica gel 100–200 and 230–400
mesh, respectively. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) on 60 F254 plates precoated with silica gel (Merck
& Co.) and were visualized by UV-light (∼365 nm). All photophysical
studies were performed using stock solution (10–3 M in dioxane) of the fluorophore.

4.2 Analytical
Methods
1H, 13C NMR spectra were recorded
in CDCl3 solution
using Bruker (400 and 700 MHz). The signals were referenced to tetramethylsilane
and solvent used is deuterated chloroform (7.26 ppm in 1H, 77.16 ppm 13C). Chemical shifts are reported in ppm,
multiplicities are indicated by s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet),
and dd (doublet of a doublet). Elemental analyses were carried out
on a CHN analyzer. The Fl. spectra were recorded on a spectrofluorimeter.
The electronic absorption spectra were recorded with JASCO-650V UV–Vis
scanning spectrophotometer. Electrospray ionization (ESI)–liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LCMS) was recorded in Shimadzu
LCMS-2020. The X-ray quality crystals of the compounds were grown
by slow diffusion of n-hexane over CH2Cl2 or n-hexane over ethyl acetate solution.
Single-crystal X-ray data were collected on a Rigaku XtaLAB Pro 200
diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo or Cu radiation. Data
were collected and processed using CrysAlisPro (Rigaku Oxford Diffraction).
The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix
least-squares method using standard procedures. Absorption corrections
were done using Lorentz and polarization effects, where applicable.
In general, all nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically; hydrogen
atoms were fixed by geometry or located by a difference Fourier map
and refined isotropically. The complete crystallographic data for
all of the compounds are tabulated in Table S11. All bond angles, bond or other distances, dihedral angles, and
packing diagram are determined using Mercury 3.3 software. Powder
XRD data were carried out on Rigaku XRD. Time-resolved measurements
were performed by using time-correlated single-photon counting spectrometer
(Edinburgh, OB920) with laser diode source (λexc =
405 nm). A dilute LUDOX solution in water was used to measure lamp
profile. F900 decay analysis software was used to analysis the decay
curves by using nonlinear least-squares iteration method. The quality
of the fit was judged by the chi square (χ2) values.
Solid-state quantum yields were calculated using SC-30 integrating
sphere module on FS5 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments). DLS
particle size analysis was carried out using a Zetasizer Nano S from
Malvern Instruments at 25 °C. The DFT and TD-DFT studies were
performed only for compounds 1b and 2 using
CAM-B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p).
