By considering a
group of atoms as a whole, the superatom state
concept has been proposed to understand complex chemical systems.
Superatom states distributed in free space are important in determining
the interactions between superatoms and also the reactions of a superatom
system with other external molecules. Unfortunately, all free-space
superatom states reported to date are unoccupied states, which strongly
limit their applications. In this study, we predict that both occupied
and unoccupied free-space superatom states exist in an encapsulated
Ca2N nanotube. In this composite system, the inner Ca2N nanotube provides anionic electrons in free space inside
the tube, which form occupied s-, p-, and d-like superatom states.
The outer carbon nanotube layer provides an effective protection for
these free-space superatom states from the ambient environment. Such
protected superatom states with flexible occupation statuses are expected
to have a great potential in various application fields including
catalysis and electronics.

Introduction
Atoms are the fundamental
construction unit of materials. The macroscopic
properties of materials are thus dictated by the type of bonding presented
between the constituting atomic species. However, sometimes, it is
more convenient to understand the system properties by considering
a number of atoms as a whole.1 When they
can mimic the chemistry of an atom, such groups of atoms are called
superatoms.2,3 The superatom concept has been widely used
to explain the building block character of atomic clusters.4,5 When an extended concept, such as super valence bonds,6 is applied, the stability of even more complicated
structure can be understood.7,8

The superatom
concept can also be applied to hollow structures
where molecular orbitals with atomic characters can be observed. Two
recent examples are fullerene C60 and carbon nanotubes
(CNTs).9−12 The electronic structure analysis showed that their superatom states
are distinct from those ordinary clusters and come from many-body
screening and the corresponding image potential.11,12 These states are called nearly free-electron (NFE) states in layer
materials such as graphene.13−15 The NFE-like superatom states
are mainly distributed in free space (FS) and typically have high
energies in the unoccupied conductance band manifold.10,16−19

When using atoms to build molecules and materials, both occupied
and unoccupied atomic orbitals play an important role. Similarly,
when using superatom states to understand and tune the properties
of the associating system, it is desirable to have both occupied and
unoccupied superatom states. For example, nucleophilic and electrophilic
active sites may be determined by superatom states with different
occupation status. To obtain occupied FS superatom states or lower
the energy of superatom states, chemical modifications or external
electric fields can be applied,16,20 which significantly
complicate the superatom concept and restrict its applications. It
is thus very desirable to obtain intrinsically occupied FS superatom
states.

Because FS superatom states are closely related with
NFE states,
it is natural to check the availability of occupied or partially occupied
NFE sates in two-dimensional (2D) systems, that is, 2D electron gas
in FS (2DEG-FS). Motivated by electride materials,21,22 where electrons distributed in FS act as anions, we have recently
designed a Ca2N sheet with 2DEG-FS states.23 Ca2N monolayer has already been synthesized
in the experiment,24 and the associated
2DEG-FS states are expected to provide an ideal electron-transport
channel with minimum scattering from the atomic lattice. We expect
that rolling Ca2N monolayer into nanotubes can produce
occupied FS superatomic orbitals projected onto the cross section.
These states should be chemically very active. To stabilize them,
a proper encapsulation protocol should be introduced.

In this
study, we systematically investigate the properties of
a CNT and Ca2N nanotube composite system (Ca2N@CNT) from first principles. On the basis of energetics from density
functional theory (DFT), the stability of the composite system is
analyzed. Then, occupied FS superatom states in Ca2N@CNT
are predicted from DFT calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that
CNT encapsulation can protect these states from attacking of ambient
molecules, which is distinct from the Ca2N monolayer case
where thicker graphane is required to provide an effective protection.
We expect that realization of such intrinsically occupied FS superatom
states will open a new avenue for material design in various fields
including catalysis and electronics.

Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1, the Ca2N monolayer is composited of a nitrogen layer
sandwiched between two layers of calcium atoms. The unit cell of a
Ca2N monolayer contains two calcium atoms in coordination
with one nitrogen atom. The optimized lattice parameters are a = b = 3.60 Å. The electronic band
structure of a Ca2N monolayer is characterized by the partially
occupied 2DEG-FS state (see in Figure S1). The Ca2N monolayer has been successfully obtained in
a recent experiment.24 Ca2N
nanotubes are expected to be obtained by the rolling Ca2N monolayer, as demonstrated by the experimental synthesis of CdCl2 nanotubes with a similar structure.25

Ca2N nanotubes. (d) Strain energy of Ca2N nanotubes

Adopting the nomenclature of CNTs,26 we can classify single-wall Ca2N nanotubes by the chiral
vector along which the Ca2N monolayer is rolled into a
cylindrical nanotube. The chiral vector  can be expressed as
a combination of the
two basic lattice vectors 1  

Any Ca2N nanotube can be defined
by the two coefficients
(n, m). For armchair (Figure 1b) and zigzag (Figure 1c) nanotubes, we have n = m and m = 0, respectively.

The optimized structure of (8, 8) and (14, 0) Ca2N nanotubes
is shown in Figure 1b,c. Generally, no significant structure relaxation has been observed,
except the strain because of the rolling of the Ca2N monolayer.
No strain is detected along the tube direction. For example, the lattice
parameter optimized for the zigzag Ca2N nanotube is 6.22
Å, which matches well with  × a1 with a1 as the lattice parameter of the Ca2N monolayer.23 The strain energy as a
function of Ca2N nanotube diameter is shown in Figure 1d. As expected, the
strain energy decreases with the nanotube diameter, and it will converge
to zero when the diameter becomes infinitely large and the nanotube
becomes a monolayer. More importantly, the strain energy of Ca2N nanotubes is smaller than that of MoS2 nanotubes
with a similar diameter as shown in Figure S3, which indicates the stability of Ca2N nanotubes.

The ground-state electronic band structure for Ca2N
can be well understood from that of the Ca2N monolayer
by considering the discretization of the k points
enforced by the von Karmann boundary condition along the chiral vector
direction.26 As a result, similar one-dimensional
electron gases in FS (1DEG-FS) states are found in Ca2N
nanotubes (Figures 2 and 3). Electron
localization function (ELF) analysis clearly shows electron localization
on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the nanotube wall. It
also indicates an ionic bonding between the [Ca2N]+ nanotube framework and the floating electrons. Therefore,
according to the criterion we proposed before,27 Ca2N nanotubes are electride in nature.

states.

As already reported in the literature,
the Ca2N surface
is chemically very active and it is ready to react with molecules
in the ambient environment, such as O2 and H2O.22,28 Although Ca2N nanotubes are mechanically
stable, they require a protection to their intrinsic electronic structure.
Therefore, in this study, instead of pristine Ca2N nanotubes,
we will focus on a composite system with a Ca2N nanotube
encapsulated in a CNT. We name it (m, n)@(a, b), where (m, n) and (a, b) are the chiral indices of the inner Ca2N nanotube and
the outer CNT, respectively. Notice that, besides CNT, other kinds
of materials such as graphane nanotubes may also be used to protect
superatom states. The optimized unit length of a (17, 17) armchair
CNT is 2.46 Å. For the (6, 6)@(17, 17) composite system, we use
a 1 × 1 × 3 CNT super cell to match a 1 × 1 ×
2 Ca2N nanotube super cell. The corresponding lattice mismatch
is less than 3%. In Figure 4a, the optimized geometry of (6, 6)@(17, 17) is plotted and
the unit length along the tube direction is determined to be 7.40
Å.

Figure 4 (a) Cross section and side view of the (6, 6)@(17, 17) composite
system. (b) Ground-state band structure of (6, 6)@(17, 17). Bands
from Ca2N nanotubes and CNT are marked in red and black,
respectively. Bands for s-, p-, and d-superatom-like states in FS
are plotted with dashed lines.

The electronic band of (6, 6)@(17, 17) can be understood
as a combination
of the Ca2N (6, 6) nanotube and the (17, 17) CNT. A charge
transfer (0.46 electrons per Ca2N formula unit) from Ca2N to CNT (17, 17) takes place. Because of such a charge transfer,
some originally unoccupied CNT states become occupied. The lowest
(l < 3) 1DEG-FS states formed by the band folding
of Ca2N nanotubes remain largely intact. The spatial distribution
of these 1DEG-FS states is plotted in Figure 5a, which clearly show a superatomic state
character. Hereafter, we will call these states superatom states.
They are also marked as red dashed lines in the band structure (Figure 4b). The first superatom
band, which is −1.10 eV below the Fermi level at the Γ
point, has a s-like character in the cross section.10 Following the s superatom state, at −0.878 and −0.362
eV, the almost doubly degenerated p and d superatom states were also
revealed with a similar number of angular momentum nodes in the cross
section as observed in atomic orbitals. The superatom states of the
freestanding (17, 17) CNT are very high in energy (more than 3.2 eV
above the Fermi level, Figure S5). Therefore,
they will not contribute to the interaction between Ca2N and CNT nanotubes. The ELF map also confirms that there is no chemical
bonding between these two nanotubes (Figure S6).

Figure 5 (a) Partial charge densities of 1DEG-FS superatom states below
the Fermi level at the Γ (the isosurface value is 1.5 ×
10–4 e bohr–3 for s-type states
and 2 × 10–4 e bohr–3 for
others). (b) Effective potential and (c) 1D charge density line profiles
along the cross sections of the s-, p-, and d-like 1DEG-FS superatom-like
states of the (6, 6)@(17, 17) at the Γ point. The vertical dotted
and dashed lines show outer wall positions for CNT and Ca2N nanotube, respectively.

The origin of the superatom states in nanotubes has been
discussed
in detail by Hu et al.,10 where the image
potential from many-body screen plays a critical role. The curvature-induced
dipole moment change of tubules results in enhanced attractive image
potential at the cylindrical center. This enhanced image potential
in turn provides stability to low-lying NFE states. Such a potential
depends on the radius of the nanotube and is independent of chirality
and electronic nature of the tube.10 In Figure 5, we plot the angle-averaged
radial effective potential calculated from DFT and the corresponding
radial distribution of the superatom states. The lowest occupied superatoms
states (l < 3) are stabilized well inside the
Ca2N nanotube wall.

Compared to superatom states
in a freestanding (6, 6) Ca2N nanotube (Figure S4), the superatom
states in (6, 6)@(17, 17) are more close to the Fermi level because
of charge transfer between the outer and inner nanotubes. More importantly,
because of the very limited intertube space, there is also a significant
change of the spatial distribution for the superatom state with l > 1. In the freestanding Ca2N nanotube,
just
like in CNT and BN nanotubes, the superatom states with s and p characters
are mainly distributed inside the tube, whereas those with larger l (d, f, ...) are mainly distributed outside the tube. In
this composite system, s, p, and d states are all inside the inner
Ca2N tube. This feature is desirable for applications such
as development of novel catalysis in the confined nanotube inner space.29

In the previous study, we find that graphene
cannot provide an
effective protection to the 2DEG-FS state of Ca2N monolayer
and thicker graphane is required for this purpose.22 It is thus very interesting to see if the CNT can effectively
protect the superatom states in this system from reaction with ambient
molecules, such as N2, O2, and H2O. As listed in Table 1, first-principles calculations show that N2 and H2O molecules only weakly bind to (6, 6)@(17, 17), which is
a typical physisorption with negligible charge transfer. The adsorption
energy of O2 is −0.331 eV, and it takes 0.344 electrons
from the composite nanotube system. Therefore, more analysis is deserved
for O2 adsorption.

Ead (eV)	–0.139	–0.331	–0.268	
qt (e)a	0.002	0.344	0.002	
a Negative sign in qt corresponds
to electron transfer from the adsorbate
to the substrate.

The band
structure of O2-adsorbed (6, 6)@(17, 17) does
not show any significant change for superatom states (Figure 6a). At the same time, Bader’s
charge population analysis suggests that O2 adsorption
does not change the charge population of the inner Ca2N
nanotube (24.52 electrons) and that partial charge density for states
1.5 eV below the Fermi level (Figure 6b) also indicates that the superatom states will not
be affected by O2 adsorption. This is also confirmed explicitly
by the plot of Γ-point charge densities for p (l = 1) superatom states with the O2-adsorbed (6, 6)@(17,
17) super cell (Figure S8). The superatom
states in the CNT-covered Ca2N nanotube are also expected
to be less sensitive to the external transverse electric field because
of the screening effect of CNT.

density for bands 1.5 eV below the Fermi level for O2-adsorbed

Conclusions
In summary, we have
designed a new 1D composite material with an
inner Ca2N nanotube and an outer CNT. In such a system,
occupied superatom states in the inner space of the Ca2N nanotube can stably exist in the ambient environment, thanks to
the CNT encapsulation. Because they are distributed in the inner space
of the Ca2N nanotube, CNT can provide an effective protection
to the superatom states. This is different from the case for 2DEG-FS
state protection in the Ca2N monolayer, where thicker graphane
instead of graphene is required. The results presented here open a
new avenue for tuning the chemical activity in a confined low-dimensional
space.

Computational Details
First-principles calculations
were carried out within the framework
of DFT using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).30,31 The projector-augmented wave32,33 method was employed
to describe the electron–ion interaction, whereas the exchange–correlation
potentials were modeled using the generalized gradient approximation
parameterization proposed by Perdew et al. (GGA-PBE).34 In all calculations, the plane wave cutoff energy was set
to 500 eV. Structures were fully relaxed until energy and residual
forces were converged to values less than 10–5 eV
and 0.01 eV Å–1, respectively. Charge population
analysis was carried out by Bader’s atom in molecule method
based on electron density topology.35

The nanotube axis was set along the z-axis, and
a vacuum region >15 Å was introduced in the x and y directions to eliminate the effects originated
from the interactions between two neighboring nanotubes under the
periodic boundary condition. A total of 1 × 1 × 9 and 1
× 1 × 7 k-meshes were used for the calculation
of armchair and zigzag Ca2N nanotubes, respectively. The k-mesh used for geometry optimization and static calculations
for the (6, 6)@(17, 17) composite system were chosen to be 1 ×
1 × 5 and 1 × 1 × 8, respectively. To determine their
relative stabilities, we calculated the strain energy of various Ca2N nanotubes in electronvolt per angstrom, which was defined
as the energy increase because of the rolling-up of the monolayer 2  where ENT is the
total energy of the nanotube unit cell, EML is the energy of the unit cell of the Ca2N monolayer, n is the number of Ca2N units in one nanotube
unit cell, and L is the length of the cell along
the z-axis. When molecular adsorption was considered,
an adsorption energy is defined as 3  where Etotal is
the energy of the molecular adsorbed system and Esubstrate and Emolecule are
the energies of the substrate and the molecule, respectively. The
more negative the adsorption energy, the stronger is the adsorption.
