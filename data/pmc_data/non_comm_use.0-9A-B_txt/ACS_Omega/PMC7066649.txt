This paper describes the synthesis and characterization of three
new aromatic polyketones with repeating units based on 2,2′-(2,5-dihexyl-1,4-phenylene)
dithiophene (PTK), 2,2′-(9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)dithiophene
(PFTK), and 4,7-bis(3-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole
(PBTK). These polymers were obtained with a one-pot Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling-promoted homopolymerization to afford high-quality,
defect-free polymers. Experimental and theoretical studies were applied
to investigate their optical and electrical properties. The cross-conjugated
nature of aromatic polyketones imparts excellent thermal stability.
Exposure to acid converts the cross-conjugation to linear-conjugation,
enabling the dynamic tuning of optoelectronic properties.

1 Introduction
Aromatic polyketones, where the backbones are composed of repeating
diarylketones, are well-known as high-performance polymers with excellent
chemical and physical properties and remarkable thermal stability.1 These materials have exhibited potential applications
as super-engineering plastics.1−3 However, aromatic polyketones
have only recently been investigated as electro-active materials,
in particular, as n-type optoelectronic semiconductors.4,5 Moreover, cross-conjugated aromatic polyketones are useful as precursors
to linearly-conjugated polymers with unique properties by the addition
of nucleophiles. The resulting polymers, which we refer to as conjugated
polyions (CPIs), are pristine semiconductors that bear charges in
the backbone, making them processable from polar, protic solvents.6,7 Although CPIs bear charges in the backbone, they are closed-shell,
meaning they do not act as polarons, and the polymers, therefore,
remain in a semiconducting state. These properties cannot be achieved
by traditional doping, which is why we sought to develop more robust
syntheses for their polyketone precursors.

There are relatively few reports about novel polymerization methods
to prepare cross-conjugated aromatic polyketones. Curtis and co-workers
developed the synthesis of cross-conjugated aromatic poly(3-alkylthiophene)ketones
by a Pd-catalyzed copolymerization of bis(chloromercury)-thiophenes
(highly toxic) with carbon oxides (high pressure) in hot pyridine.8−10 Hudson and co-workers reported the synthesis of aromatic polyketones
through an aldol condensation of cyclic ketones with aromatic dialdehydes.11 However, these aromatic polyketones materials
suffered from low solubility because they were partially cross-linked.
Gibson and co-workers reported the synthesis of aromatic polyketones
via the nucleophilic aromatic substitution between arylene dihalides
and dicarbanions derived from bis(α-amino nitrile)s, followed
by hydrolysis.2,3 However, the synthesis of bis(α-amino
nitrile)s involved NaCN, and the post-polymerization was hard to achieve
high yields and would produce side products. Ito and co-workers reported
a palladium-catalyzed alternating copolymerization of formal aryne
with carbon monoxide.12 Subsequent acid-promoted
dehydration yielded the new aromatic polyketones. This method produced
aromatic polyketones together with the corresponding polyketal isomers.
Both band gaps and the absolute energies of molecular orbitals are
important parameters to control for organic semiconductors;13 however, the aforementioned synthetic routes
are not targeted at semiconducting properties and thus are limited
in the ability to tune these properties in aromatic polyketones.12 The electrophilic Friedel–Crafts polymerization
between bifunctional aromatic acyl chlorides and electron-rich aromatic
compounds can generate high-quality aromatic polyketones, but it has
a narrow scope of substrates.14−17 Hence, it is necessary to develop new strategies
for the synthesis of aromatic polyketones that allows a broader substrate
scope if they are to be developed as semiconducting materials.

Transition metal (palladium or nickel)-catalyzed polymerization
promoted by cross-couplings such as Stille and Suzuki–Miyaura
couplings have been widely used to construct conjugated polymers,
in general. However, there are few reports of a transition metal-catalyzed
polymerization method being used to synthesize an aromatic polyketone.4,18−20 We have previously shown that one-pot borylation/cross-coupling
polymerizations are superior to Stille copolymerization for control
over end group chemistry.21,22 Here, we expand the
scope of this polymerization method to the synthesis of aromatic polyketones
for use as semiconducting materials and precursors to conjugated polyions23 with the synthesis and characterization of three
new aromatic polyketones with electron-neutral (PTK), electron-withdrawing
(PBTK), and electron-donating groups (PFTK) in the backbone. These
polymers were synthesized with a one-pot Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling
promoted homopolymerization, which offered good chemical integrity.
We systematically investigate the band gap and molecular energy levels
of these aromatic polyketones by absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry,
and theoretical calculation. As with conventional conjugated polymers,
the aromatic polyketones exhibited tunable optoelectronic properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
The
synthetic route of the three aromatic polyketones is shown in Figure 1. The synthesis of
carbonyl-containing monomers are shown in the Supporting Information. The polymers (PTK, PBTK, and PFTK)
were synthesized via one-pot Suzuki homo-coupling polymerization from
the symmetric, bisbromo, ketone-containing monomers. We employed the
same polymerization condition for the synthesis of aromatic polyketones
as our previous contribution.21,22 We chose DMF and toluene
as polymerization co-solvents because DMF can accelerate standard
Suzuki polymerization, and toluene is a good solvent for the resulting
polymer. Polymers were obtained by refluxing the polymerization mixture
overnight. Impurities and low-molecular-weight fractions were removed
by methanol and hexane in a Soxhlet extractor. Finally, the polymers
were extracted with chloroform, precipitated in methanol, and further
dried under vacuum. Some insoluble solids remained after extracting,
likely due to the low solubility of the very high molecular weight
fractions. This phenomenon has also been observed in a previous work.22 The molecular weights of these aromatic polyketones
were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene
as standards (see Figures S19–S21). The resulting data are shown in Table 1. The MW values
of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK are 57.7, 12.7, and 7.6 kDa, respectively.
PFTK and PBTK exhibited moderate distribution with the dispersity
index (Đ) values of 1.83 and 2.03, respectively,
while PTK showed a broad distribution with a higher value of Đ
of 7.88. The high values of Đ could be an indication of an addition
polymerization mechanism. Step polymerization reactions typically
yield values of Đ around 2.0, whereas chain reactions yield
values of Đ between 1.5 and 20. Therefore, it is hard to determine
whether this polymerization method is step-growth or chain-growth.
(A full investigation of the mechanism of polymerization is beyond
the scope of this paper.) The chemical structures of aromatic polyketones
were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), 1HNMR, and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. The FT-IR data confirmed the
presence/absence of expected/unexpected functional groups in aromatic
polyketones. The inclusion of the carbonyl group into the polymer
was confirmed by the appearance of the C=O stretching mode
around 1600 cm–1 in the (FT-IR) spectroscopy, which
is shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S16–S18).

homo-polymerization.

Table 1 Molecular Weight and Thermal Properties
of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK
polymer	Mn (kg mol–1)	MW (kg mol–1)	Đ	Tg (°C)	Td (°C)	Tm (°C)	
PTK	7.3	57.7	7.88	76	380	230	
PBTK	6.3	12.7	2.03	100	330	250	
PFTK	4.2	7.6	1.83	124	400	225	
The well-resolved peaks in 1HNMR, especially in the
aliphatic region, could be viewed as an indication of the high quality
and regioregularity of these aromatic polyketones, which are shown
in Figures S13–S15. The NMR data
(see the Experimental Section) confirmed the
connectivity of the polymers, but were not sensitive enough to differentiate
the end-groups. The high uniformity and uniform end-groups of these
aromatic polyketones are reflected in the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra shown
in Figure 2a. As seen
in the figure, all spectra show identical repeating peaks, with a
repetition interval of 630 Da for PTK, 688 Da for PBTK, and 718 Da
for PFTK, respectively, which is consistent with the mass of the monomer
unit. In addition, there are no residual Br or boronic ester end groups
in all the aromatic polyketones. Some side peaks with higher m/z values around the major peaks are observed
as shown in Figure 2b. In PFTK, one of the extra peaks at the tetrameter +17 m/z, might be corresponding to the addition
of a hydroxyl group to a polymer chain that transferred from the 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid matrix.

to the bis-H-terminated repeating unit (Xn) are labeled
with numbers. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid is used as the matrix for
all spectra. (b) Zoom-in of peaks 4 of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK.

2.2 Thermal Properties
The thermal properties
of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The TGA and DSC
results are shown in Figure 3, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. All PTK, PBTK, and PFTK showed
excellent thermal stability and exhibited a double thermal decomposition
process. The decomposition temperature (Td), where 5% weight loss is reached, is at 380, 330, and 400 °C
for PTK, PBTK, and PFTK, respectively. The weight loss of first decomposition
step is around 37, 23, and 41 wt % for PTK, PBTK, and PFTK, respectively,
which likely correspond to the loss of the hexyl pendant group. The
molecular weight ratio of the hexyl pendant group is 39, 20, and 46%
for PTK, PBTK, and PFTK, respectively. Given that the high Td temperatures of these aromatic polyketones,
it is reasonable to assume that they can be thermally processed without
degradation, which may facilitate their eventual use in organic optoelectronic
devices.

Figure 3 (a) Thermogravimetric analysis plots and (b) DSC curves for PTK,
PBTK, and PFTK on second heat, 10 °C/min.

The DSC results reveal that these aromatic polyketones are semicrystalline
materials. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK is at 76, 100, 124 °C, respectively.
The increasing Tg from PTK to PBTK to PFTK is consistent
with increasing the degree of backbone rigidity of these aromatic
polyketones. Moreover, this trend of Tg is also consistent with increasing the degree of PDI these aromatic
polyketones. A broad melting endotherm peak was observed at 230 °C
for PTK and 250 °C for PBTK, respectively, while the small melting
transition was observed for 225 °C PFTK from the full DSC curves
(see the Supporting Information, Figures S22–S24). The decreasing melting endotherm trend of aromatic polyketones
from PTK to PBTK to PFTK indicates the decrease of crystallinity.

2.3 Photophysical Properties
Figure 4a shows the UV–vis
absorption spectra for the aromatic polyketones in the CHCl3 solution and thin films. Their photophysical properties and the
estimated optical band-gap are summarized in Table 2. The maximum absorption peak of PTK, PBTK,
and PFTK is at 408, 428, and 445 nm in CHCl3, respectively,
which is attributable to the characteristic absorption of the π→π*
transition of the polymer backbone. The maximum thin film absorption
peak of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK is at 420, 445, and 450 nm, respectively.
Compared with solution absorption, all aromatic polyketone thin-film
absorptions show a red shift, indicating an enhanced interchain π–π
stacking in the solid state. According to the thin film absorption
onset, the estimated optical band gaps of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK is 2.51,
2.36, and 2.30 eV, respectively, which indicates that inserting an electron donor or acceptor
group can effectively reduce the band gap in this cross-conjugated
system. Thus, despite being cross-conjugated, the tunable optoelectronic
properties of aromatic polyketones mirror those of conventional, linear
conjugated polymers.

and PFTK in the CHCl3 solution and thin films. (b) Normalized

PBTK, and PFTK

(nm)	
PTK	408	420	494	2.51	490	82	
PBTK	428	445	526	2.36	541	113	
PFTK	445	450	539	2.30	520	75	
We also acquired the absorption spectrum of protonated aromatic
polyketones by treating them with H2SO4, as
shown in Figure 4b.
This protonation process is shown in Figure 5; protonation of the carbonyl units breaks
the cross-conjugation by generating closed-shell carbocations in the
conjugated backbone, converting the cross-conjugation to linear conjugation.5−7,23 The net effect is to increase
the conjugation length dynamically, which is reflected in a decrease
in the band gap from 2.51 to 1.76 eV for PTK, 2.36 to 1.85 eV for
PBTK, and 2.30 to 1.41 eV for PFTK. The mild electron-donating nature
of fluorene stabilizes the carbocations, leading to the largest shift.
The smallest shift occurs with PBTK, likely a due to the electron-withdrawing
nature of benzothiadiazole. The photophysical properties of the polyketones
in their protonated form is predictive of the properties of CPIs derived
from them because protonation of the carbonyl oxygens results in the
formation of (transient) carbocations in the backbone, which function
as acceptors. Thus, the UV–vis spectra of protonated polyketones
give insight into the donor–acceptor copolymer nature of the
corresponding CPI. In this case, the donor character of fluorene interacts
with the acceptor character of the diaryl carbocation, which is invariant
across the series, to give the largest red shift, indicating that
fluorene has the most donor character.

Figure 5 Protonation process in aromatic polyketones.

The steady-state fluorescence spectra of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK in
CHCl3 are shown in Figure 6a with steady-state emission peaks at 490, 541, and
520 nm respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence intensities are shown
in Figure 6b. PBTK
and PFTK clearly show mono-exponential photoluminescence decay with
PBTK exhibiting the longest fluorescence lifetime of 745 ps while
PFTK had a shorter lifetime of 500 ps. The photoluminescence decay
of PTK, however, is bi-exponential, with lifetimes of 35 and 267 ps
(see Figure S25 for fits). Interestingly,
PTK shows a Stokes shift of 82 nm, while the Stokes shift of PFTK
is only 75 nm, and PBTK exhibits the largest shift of 113 nm. These
shifts are not consistent with the changes in absorption spectra,
which indicates that the different aryl groups introduce significant
conformational flexibility, in agreement with the DSC measurements
discussed above.

and PFTK in the CHCl3 solution. (b) Time-resolved fluorescence

photoluminescence decay with PBTK exhibiting a lifetime of 745 ps
and PFTK a lifetime of 500 ps. PTK showed bi-exponential photoluminescence
decay with lifetimes of 35 ps and 267 ps.

2.4 Electrochemical Properties
In order
to gain an insightful understanding of the electrochemical properties
of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization
was carried out, and the results are shown in Figure 7. Half-wave reduction potentials and the
estimated LUMO levels of aromatic polyketones are listed in Table 3. Ferrocene/ferrocenium
(Fc/Fc+) was used as a standard reference, which was assigned
an absolute energy of −4.8 eV versus vacuum. As expected,4 all the aromatic polyketones exhibited two fully
reversible reduction waves. The first half-wave reduction peak of
PTK, PBTK, and PFTK are −1.81, −1.76, and – 1.86
V, respectively, relative to the redox potential of Fc/Fc+. The LUMO energy levels of aromatic polyketones are calculated from
the first half-wave reduction potentials using the equation . The estimated LUMO energy levels of PTK,
PBTK, and PFTK are −2.99, −3.04, and – 2.94 eV,
respectively. The HOMO energy level was calculated based on the optical
band gap and the LUMO energy level. The estimated HOMO energy levels
of PTK, PBTK, and PFTK are −5.50, −5.34, and −5.30
eV, respectively. The LUMO energy level of PBTK is 0.1 eV lower than
that of PTK, and the HOMO energy level is 0.16 eV higher than that
of PTK. The LUMO energy level of PFTK is 0.05 eV higher than that
of PTK, and the HOMO energy level is 0.2 eV higher than that of PTK.
PBTK exhibited the lowest LUMO energy level, and PFTK showed the highest
HOMO energy level, which indicates that the electron-deficient group
(benzothiadiazole) can reduce the LUMO energy level and the electron-rich
group (fluorene) can increase the HOMO energy level in these cross-conjugated
polymers.

2.5 Density Functional Theory Calculation
To investigate the electronic structures, density functional theory
(DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-311G(p) level using
the Gaussian 16 program.24 All polymers
having two repeat units with the methyl substituent were used to reduce
the calculation time. The optimized geometries for aromatic polyketones
are shown in Figure S26. All polymers exhibit
twisted gas-phase geometries, which might originate from the conformational
flexibility link of the ketone unit. Compared to PTK, PFTK is more
planar, and PBTK is more twisted. The calculated molecular frontier
molecular orbitals are shown in Figure 8 and are summarized in Table 3. Twisted backbone geometries typically are
unfavorable for charge delocalization and transfer; nonetheless, in
PTK and PBTK, the HOMO is distributed across the entire backbone.
While in PFTK, the HOMO is mainly localized on the fluorene moiety,
only slightly extending to the thiophene unit. The LUMOs of PTK and
PFTK are mainly distributed over the thiophene and ketone groups.
The LUMO of PBTK is mainly localized on the benzothiadiazole unit,
extending slightly to the thiophene and ketone units due to the electron-deficient
nature of benzothiadiazole and ketones. Therefore, aromatic polyketones
with the electron-deficient group (benzothiadiazole) show the lowest
LUMO energy level, and electron-rich group (fluorene) show the highest
HOMO energy level. These values are consistent with the electrochemical
data, indicating that the calculations on short oligomers are a reasonable
approximation for the polymers (in solution). Furthermore, the lower
LUMO of PBTK and higher HOMO of PFTK give rise to smaller band gaps
compared with PTK, which accounts for the red shift observed in the
absorption spectra.

were performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(p) level using the program Gaussian
16.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we reported a new synthetic approach for the preparation
of aromatic polyketones. This strategy shows a much larger substrate
scope than the Friedel–Crafts polymerization methods previously
employed. We were, therefore, able to prepare aromatic polyketones
with electron-rich, neutral, and deficient units and to investigate
their thermal, photophysical, and redox properties. In their neutral,
cross-conjugated form, all polymers responded to the inclusion of
electron-rich and electron-poor groups identically to linearly conjugated
donor–acceptor polymers. Upon protonation, the carbonyl carbons
become trivalent, extending the conjugation of the polymers dynamically.
While the interest in aromatic polyketones is primarily as precursors
to polymers with more interesting properties,23 this work demonstrates that they posses useful properties on their
own and sheds light on the role of cross-conjugation in band-gap engineering.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Measurement and Characterization
1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured using
a Varian AMX400 (400 MHz) instrument at room temperature. NMR shifts
are reported in ppm, relative to the residual protonated solvent signals
of CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 ppm) or at the carbon absorption
in CDCl3 (δ = 77.23 ppm). Multiplicities are denoted
as: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t) and multiplet (m). High-resolution
mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was performed on a JEOL JMS 600 spectrometer.
FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus FT-IR fitted with a
Thermo Scientific Smart iTR sampler. GPC measurements were done on
a Spectra Physics AS 1000 series machine equipped with a Viskotek
H-502 viscometer and a Shodex RI-71 refractive index detector. The
columns (PLGel 5 m mixed-C) (Polymer Laboratories) were calibrated
using narrow disperse polystyrene standards (Polymer Laboratories).
Samples were made in THF at a concentration of 1 mg mL–1 and filtered through a Gelman GHP Acrodisc 0.45μ membrane
filter before injection. Thermal properties of the polymers were determined
on TA Instruments DSC Q20, and TGA Q50 DSC measurements were executed
with two heating–cooling cycles with a scan rate of 10 °C
min–1, and from each scan, the second heating cycle
was selected. TGA measurements were done from 20 to 700 °C with
a heating rate of 20 °C min–1. UV–vis
measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu UV 3600 spectrometer.
Photoluminescence measurements were carried out on solutions contained
in quartz cuvettes. The samples were excited by the second harmonic
(approximately 400 nm) of a mode-locked Mira 900 Ti:Sapphire laser
delivering 150 ps pulses at a repetition rate of 76 MHz. The laser
power was adjusted using neutral density filters, and the excitation
beam was spatially limited by an iris. The beam was focused with a
150 mm focal length in reflection geometry. Steady state spectra were
collected by a spectrometer with a 50 lines/mm grating and recorded
with a Hamamatsu em-CCD array. For time-resolved measurements, the
same pulsed excitation source was used. Spectra were in this case
collected on a Hamamatsu streak camera working in Synchroscan mode
(time resolution 2 ps) with a cathode sensitive in the visible spectra.
All plotted spectra were corrected for the spectral response of the
setup using a calibrated lamp. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried
out with an Autolab PGSTAT100 potentiostat in a three-electrode configuration
where the working electrode was platinum electrode, the counter electrode
was a platinum wire, and the pseudo-reference was a Ag wire that was
calibrated against ferrocene (Fc/Fc+). Cyclic voltammograms
of aromatic polyketones (0.001 mol L–1) in an ODCB–CHCN3 (9: 1) solution containing a Bu4NPF6 (0.1 mol L–1) electrolyte at a scanning rate of 100 mV s–1.

4.2 General Aromatic Polyketones Synthesis Procedures
All reactions were performed under anhydrous conditions under a
nitrogen atmosphere. To a flame-dried flask containing a mixture of
DMF:Toluene were added equal molar quantities of monomer and bis(pinacolato)diboron
(BiPi). The solution was then purged with bubbling nitrogen
for 10 min before the addition of 5 to 10 mol % 1,10-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocenepalladium(II)dichloride
dichloromethane complex Pd(dppf)2Cl2 and 5 equiv
of crushed K3PO4, and the solution used a freeze-pump-thaw
cycle technique to remove O2, done three times. The reaction
mixture was carried out to 110 °C and stirred overnight (about
15 h) and cooled to room temperature, and the solvent was removed
by rotary evaporation. The remaining residue was dissolved in a minimal
amount of CHCl3 and precipitated by pouring slowly into
a large excess of CH3OH. The resulting slurry was stirred
for an hour, and the precipitate was collected by filtration and then
further purified by Soxhlet extraction with hexane, methanol, and
chloroform, successively. The chloroform fraction polymer was collected.
The purified polymer dissolved before being re-precipitated into cold
CH3OH and dried in vacuo.
