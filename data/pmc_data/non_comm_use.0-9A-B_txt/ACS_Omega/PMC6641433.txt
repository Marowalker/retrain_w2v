Er3+-doped Y2O3 nanoparticles
(NPs) are used to synthesize transparent ceramics by hot isostatic
pressing. Two sizes of NPs are studied, and 40 nm NPs show better
performance than 200 nm NPs in transparent ceramics syntheses. The
axial optical transmission through millimeter thickness of the prepared
ceramics is about 80% in the wavelength range of 1000–2000
nm. For a sample with 11.5 ppm Er3+, the inhomogeneous
broadening of the 4I15/2 to 4I13/2 transition for the C2 site is as low as 0.42
GHz (full width at half-maximum), and the homogeneous line width is
11.2 kHz at a temperature of 2.5 K and in a 0.65 T magnetic field.
This indicates that a majority of Er3+ ions are sitting
in sites with very low structural disorder.

Introduction
Quantum memories are important components
for quantum information
processing, such as quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication.1−4 Among studied systems, rare-earth ion-doped solids offer interesting
perspectives as quantum optical memories.4−6 The 4f–4f
transitions of rare-earth ions are extremely narrow with long optical
coherence time, which makes them suitable for transferring photonic quantum states to collective
atomic states. However, these optical transitions are usually strongly
affected by the local structural environments of dopant ions.7−9 To achieve a long optical coherence time, rare-earth ions are ideally
incorporated into the crystal lattices of the host material. To date,
research in this field mainly focuses on rare-earth-doped single crystals.6

Transparent polycrystalline ceramics could
be alternatives to single
crystals in optical applications.10−13 Compared to single crystals,
polycrystalline ceramics offer a number of advantages such as large-scale
production and ease of processing in device fabrications.10 Recently, Goldner et al. have reported transparent
Eu3+-doped Y2O3 ceramics synthesized
by sintering a mixture of Y2O3 nanoparticles
(NPs, 50 nm) and Eu2O3 NPs (200 nm).14,15 After minimizing defect centers, optical studies reveal homogeneous
line widths on the order of 4 kHz,16,17 which are
comparable to the line widths achieved in the rare-earth-doped single
crystals.6 This study suggests that polycrystalline
ceramics are interesting alternatives to single crystals in quantum
information processing.

We present here a new method to synthesize
transparent Er3+-doped Y2O3 ceramics
using Er3+-doped
Y2O3 NPs as starting materials. Doping Er3+ ions into NPs through a solution-phase synthesis can help
to improve Er3+-ion distribution in the Y2O3 matrix and discourage the Er3+ clustering. Hot
isostatic pressing (HIP) is used to sinter Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs into transparent ceramics. The axial optical
transmission through millimeter thickness of the synthesized ceramics
is about 80% in the wavelength range of 1000–2000 nm. The optical
coherence lifetime of the Er3+4I13/2–4I15/2 transition is measured by a
two-pulse photon echo technique. In a 11.5 ppm Er3+ sample,
a 11.2 kHz homogeneous line width is recorded at a temperature of
2.5 K and in a 0.65 T magnetic field.

Results and Discussion
Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs are synthesized
by the reaction of urea, YCl3, and ErCl3 in
boiled water, which produces Y1–xErx(OH)CO3·H2O NPs.18 The latter are converted into
Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs by thermal annealing
in air at 750 °C. The powder X-ray diffraction analysis reveals
a pure cubic Y2O3 phase (Figure 1a). We find that the size of NPs can be tuned
by simply changing the synthesis process while still using the same
concentrations of chemical regents: heating up a mixture of urea (6.7
mol) and metal salts (0.22 mol) in water (4.25 L) produces NPs of
about 200 nm, and pouring a urea solution (6.7 mol in 0.25 L water)
into a boiled metal salt solution (0.22 mol in 4 L of water) produces
NPs of about 40 nm (Figure 1b,c). The Er3+ concentration in NPs can be tuned
by varying the Er/Y ratios in the starting materials.

electron microscopy (SEM) images of Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs synthesized using the same concentrations of chemical

solution (6.7 mol in 0.25 L water) into a boiled metal salt solution
(0.22 mol in 4 L water).

HIP is used to sinter Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs into transparent ceramics. In a typical process,
Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs are pressed into
a
pellet in a steel die at approximately 8 klb force. This pellet is
isostatically pressed at 25 kpsi in a latex isopressing sheath at
room temperature, followed by sintering at 1500 °C in air for
2 h. The pellet is then hot isostatically pressed at 1490 °C
for 16 h at 29 kpsi under an argon atmosphere in a graphite furnace.
The pellet is buried inside of Y2O3 powder during
HIP to reduce carbon contamination, which comes from the graphite
furnace. Three sintering processes I–III, summarized in Table 1, are studied in this
work. These processes use the same pressure (29 kpsi) and reaction
time (2 h for air sintering and 16 h for HIP) but different temperatures
in air sintering and HIP. To minimize the grain growth during HIP,
temperatures in air sintering are slightly higher than temperatures
in HIP in all three processes.

Figure 2a shows
a pellet (1.85 mm thick and 10 mm diameter) prepared using 40 nm Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs by process II. The
sample is polished at a surface finish of 0.5 μm Ra (; the arithmetic average of roughness).
The axial optical transmission through the thickness of the pellet
is about 80% in the wavelength range of 1000–2000 nm (Figure 2b), which is close
to the theoretical limit of Y2O3 at 1535 nm
(82.7%) when only considering the surface reflections. The grain boundary
in this pellet is too small to be imaged by SEM, which has a resolution
of 3 nm. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is used to characterize
the grains (Figure 2c). The grain sizes (the equivalent diameters) range from 0.18 to
1.7 μm, with an average area of 0.31 μm2 (analysis
of 1500 grains). The grain size can be tuned by varying the sintering
temperatures. In a pellet prepared by process I at a higher temperature
(Table 1), the grain
sizes range from 0.7 to 2.1 μm, with an average area of 0.90
μm2 (analysis of 750 grains).

ceramic pellet prepared using 40 nm NPs by process II. (b) Axial optical
transmission through thickness (1.85 mm) of the pellet. (c) EBSD image
of grains in the pellet. Different colors represent different crystalline
orientations.

The transmitted scattering
of Er3+-doped Y2O3 pellets prepared
by different sintering processes was
also studied. When light passes through the pellets, the intensity
of incident beam is mainly attenuated by absorption, scattering, and
surface loss. The difference in scattering can be related to the size
and density of scattering centers (such as residual pores) in different
samples. The transmitted scattering coefficient (μ, dB/mm) is
estimated by  where Tt , Ta ,
and L are the total
transmission, the axial transmission, and the thickness of the pellet,
respectively. Figure 3 summarizes the transmitted scattering coefficients of the pellets
prepared using 40 nm NPs by sintering processes I–III. In the
long-wavelength range of over 1000 nm, the three samples show very
low scattering, and the transmitted scattering coefficients are close
to zero. This indicates that the density of large-size scattering
centers (such as micrometer pores) is very low in our ceramic pellets.
In the visible range (<750 nm), however, scattering in all three
samples is stronger. Among processes I–III, the lower temperature
process produces ceramic pellets with the least scattering.

Figure 3 Transmitted
scattering coefficient of Er3+-doped Y2O3 ceramic pellets prepared by processes I–III
using 40 nm NPs.

The NP size also influences
the ceramics synthesis. When 40 nm
NPs are used, all processes I–III produce ceramics with good
transparency. However, only process I, which has the highest temperature
among processes I–III, can produce transparent ceramics by
using 200 nm NPs (Figure 4a,b). Using the same process I, ceramics produced by 40 nm
NPs have lower scattering than ceramics produced by 200 nm NPs (Figure 4c). These results
indicate that, in our method, smaller size NPs work better in the
synthesis of transparent ceramics.

pellets prepared using 200 nm NPs by processes I (a) and II (b). (c)

In the following optical
characterizations, three Er3+-doped Y2O3 ceramic samples prepared by process
I (Table 1; 1550 °C
air sintering followed by 1515 °C HIP) with different Er3+ concentrations are studied. Er3+ concentrations
are measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

The inhomogeneous line width (Γinh) of transition
from the lowest state in 4I15/2 to the lowest
state in 4I13/2 for C2 sites around
1535 nm is magnetic-field-dependent owing to the fact that random
orientation of the crystalline phase causes inhomogeneous Zeeman splitting.
Thus, the intrinsic inhomogeneous line width is measured at zero field
and at low temperature (1.7 K) to reduce phonon broadening. The line
width is below the instrument resolution of our grating-based optical
spectral analyzer (Ando AQ6317B) (Figure 5a). Thus, we use piezo-scanned laser to measure
the transmission directly (for details, see Methods section). The transmission curve for a sample with an Er3+ concentration of 11.5 ppm is shown in Figure 5b and fitted to a Lorentzian function. The
inhomogeneous broadening [full width at half-maximum (fwhm)] is 0.42
± 0.02 GHz. This strongly indicates that the majority of Er3+ ions is sitting in the crystalline phase with very little
structural disorder.

Figure 5 (a) Transmission spectrum measured using our grating-based
optical
spectrum analyzer. The longer period oscillation comes from the multiple
reflections from the cryostat windows. The line width is instrument-resolution-limited.
(b) Transmission spectrum measured using the laser scanning technique.
The spectrum is fitted to a Lorentzian function with fwhm equal to
0.42 ± 0.02 GHz.

The homogeneous line width (Γh) of the Er3+4I13/2–4I15/2 transition at 1534.94 nm (C2 line) in transparent Er3+-doped Y2O3 ceramics is measured by
a two-pulse photon echo spectroscope19 on
three samples with different Er3+ concentrations. A typical
data set is shown in Figure 6 for the 11.5 ppm sample. Echo intensity is fitted to an exponential
function I(t12) = I0 exp[−4t12/T2]. The homogeneous line width is calculated
as Γh = 1/πT2.
Here, we saw relatively small contribution from the spectral diffusion,
likely because of the low Er3+ concentration.

intensity as a function of the delay t12 (μs) at different temperatures for the 11.5 ppm
sample. Traces are fitted to the exponential decay function to extract
the dephasing time.

The temperature dependence
of the homogeneous line width (11.5
ppm sample) at 0.65 T is shown in Figure 7a. Above 4 K, we see the typical T7 dependence because of the Raman process.20 At lower temperature, there is an additional
Γ(T) = aT1, with a = 4.5 kHz/K contribution that likely results from the
residue disorder in the sample.16,21−24

Figure 7 (a)
Temperature dependence of the homogeneous line width Γh (B = 0.65 T). At high temperature (>4 K),
the line width is dominated by the two phonon Raman process; at low
temperature, the major contribution shows a T1 temperature dependence and likely comes from tunneling states.
(b) Magnetic field dependence of the homogeneous line width Γh (T = 1.5 K).

Magnetic field dependence of the homogeneous line width of
the
same sample at T = 1.5 K is shown in Figure 7b. The line width drops precipitously
with the initial small magnetic field owing to removal of the degeneracy
of the Zeeman sublevels and subsequent decrease in the electron population
in the upper-ground-state Zeeman level. As the magnetic field increases,
the spin flip rate starts to increase because of the increase in the
available phonon density of states.25 This
resulted in a small “bump” for the homogeneous line
width at an intermediate magnetic field. Similar behavior is observed
in various Er3+-doped crystals and glasses.16,25−27

Homogeneous line widths for three samples with
different Er3+ concentrations are summarized in Table 2. Sample with high
Er3+ concentration
has a large homogeneous line width owing to Er3+–Er3+ spin interaction. As the concentration gets lower, the average
Er3+ ion distance gets larger. Below 10 ppm, the Er3+ concentration has negligible effect on the homogeneous line
width. The homogeneous line width of a 11.5 ppm sample at 2.5 K, 0.65
T is 11.2 ± 0.2 kHz (corresponding T2 = 28 μs). This result is comparable to the reported line width
of 50 ppm Er3+-doped Y2O3 single
crystals.6

Conclusions
We report the development of Er3+-doped Y2O3 transparent ceramics with long optical coherence lifetime.
Low-porosity transparent ceramics are prepared by sintering NPs using
HIP. Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs synthesized
by a wet-chemistry approach are used as starting materials to improve
the Er3+ dispersion. The prepared Er3+-doped
Y2O3 ceramics show good optical transparency
with about 80% axial transmission through 1.85 mm thickness in the
wavelength range of 1000–2000 nm. The very small inhomogeneous
broadening (0.42 GHz) and homogeneous broadening (11.2 kHz) of the
Er3+4I13/2–4I15/2 transition in our ceramics strongly suggest that Er3+ ions reside in the crystalline phase with low structural
disorder. Such transparent ceramics with well-controlled Er3+ doping are promising materials for quantum memory applications.

Methods
Materials
YCl3·6H2O (99.9%),
ErCl3·6H2O (99.995%), and urea (99.0–100.5%)
were purchased from Aldrich and used as received.

Er3+-Doped Y2O3 NP Synthesis
NPs of 200
and 40 nm were synthesized by different processes while
using the same concentrations of chemical regents. NPs of 200 nm were
synthesized by heating a mixture of YCl3·6H2O/ErCl3·6H2O (in total 0.22 mol) and urea
(6.7 mol) in deionized (DI) water (4.25 L) to 100 °C and keeping
at 100 °C for 1 h. The thermal decomposition of urea provides
OH– and CO32–, which
react with metal ions and produce Y1–xErx(OH)CO3·H2O NPs. Y1–xErx(OH)CO3·H2O NPs were collected
by filtration and were converted into (Y1–xErx)2O3 NCs
by annealing at 750 °C for 90 min. The chemical yield was about
95%. Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs of 40 nm
were synthesized by pouring a urea solution (6.7 mol in 0.25 L DI
water) into a boiled YCl3·6H2O/ErCl3·6H2O solution (0.22 mol in 4 L water), and
the reaction was allowed to run for 1 h. Y1–xErx(OH)CO3·H2O NPs were collected by a filtration process and were converted
into (Y1–xErx)2O3 NCs by annealing at 750 °C
for 90 min. The chemical yield was about 95%.

Er3+-Doped Y2O3 Transparent
Ceramics Synthesis
Millimeter thick Er3+-doped
Y2O3 transparent ceramic pellets were prepared
by HIP. In a typical process, Er3+-doped Y2O3 NPs were pressed into a pellet in a 3/4 in. steel die at
approximately 8 klb force. This pellet was isostatically pressed at
25 kpsi in a latex isopressing sheath at room temperature, followed
by sintering at 1550 °C in air for 2 h. The pellet was then pressed
at 1515 °C for 8 h at 29 kpsi in an argon atmosphere in a graphite
furnace using HIP. To reduce carbon contamination from the graphite
furnace, the pellet was buried in Y2O3 powder
during HIP.

SEM Characterizations
SEM observation
was conducted
with a Zeiss 1550 VP field-emission scanning electron microscope.
The SEM samples were prepared by putting a drop of NP–water
suspensions on the surface of 300 mesh copper transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) grids coated with lacey carbon film. The NP-decorated
lacey carbon TEM grids were fixed to a SEM stub using conductive carbon
tape and analyzed without applying a conductive coating. The Zeiss
SmartSEM instrument control software was used to measure particle
diameter.

EBSD Analysis
EBSD analysis was done on a Hitachi SU-70
FE-SEM equipped with an Oxford EDS/EBSD system (Oxford/AZTEC software
with a Nordlys camera). A piece of the material was removed and mounted
in epoxy. The material was then polished to yield a surface quality
finish that would allow diffraction pattern generation. For data acquisition,
the sample was placed in a SEM and tilted at a 70° angle to generate
Kikuchi patterns that were collected on a camera and then analyzed.
Post-process done on the data included extrapolations of wild spikes
and zero solutions in the data. Pseudosymmetry around the (111) axis
was corrected before grain size was determined.

Optical Inhomogeneous
Broadening Measurement
The inhomogeneous
line width (Γinh) was measured using a piezo-scanned
laser (TOPTICA DLpro). Briefly, the laser was scanned using a saw
tooth modulation with a peak to peak of 15 V at 2 Hz. The transmission
power was monitored with a fast photodiode and recorded on an oscilloscope.
The frequency conversion of the piezodrive was independently calibrated
using a scanning Fabry–Perot interferometer. The sample was
measured at zero field and 1.7 K to minimize the broadening owing
to inhomogeneous Zeeman splitting or phonon contribution.

Optical Coherence
Lifetime Measurement
The homogeneous
line width (Γh) of the Er3+4I13/2–4I15/2 transition at
1534.94 nm in transparent Er3+-doped Y2O3 ceramics was measured by a two-pulse photon echo technique.
The sample was placed in a liquid helium cryostat (Janis ST100), between
a pair of permanent magnets, which provided a static magnetic field
of 0.65 T, or in the Oxford Instruments Spectromag SM4000, with a
pair of superconducting magnets. The light source was a tunable diode
laser (TOPTICA DLpro) with <50 kHz line width. The light was temporally
shaped by an acoustic-optic modulator (pulse width 50 ns), before
being amplified by a fiber amplifier. The energy of the input pulse
was carefully controlled so that there was no gain depletion seen
from pulse to pulse. The output was filtered through a 1 nm band-pass
filter and an electro-optic modulator (pulse width 50 ns) to cut off
amplified spontaneous emission from the amplifier. The beam was focused
down to a spot of ∼50 μm. The input peak intensity on
the sample was 2 kW/cm2. The resulting echo was filtered
through a second electro-optic modulator and detected by an InGaAs
avalanche photodiode and averaged on the oscilloscope. An active background
subtraction was implemented by removing the first pump pulse in every
other pulse train, and the signal was subtracted from the background.
All delays between the pulses were synchronized by a personal computer.
