Noncatalytic reaction pathways for
the gas-phase stereoinversion
in aspartic acid are mapped employing a global reaction route mapping
strategy using quantum mechanical computations. The species including
the transition states (TSs) traced along the stereoinversion pathways
are characterized using rotational and vibrational computational spectroscopic
analysis while accounting for the vibrational corrections to rotational
constants and anharmonic effects. Notably, the TS structures traced
along the stereochemical pathways resemble the achiral ammonium ylide
and imine intermediates as observed in the Strecker synthesis of chiral
amino acids. A few of the probable stereoinversion pathways proposed
proceed through the proton or hydrogen atom transfer. The feasibility
of the pathways under conditions akin to interstellar medium (ISM)
is further discussed in terms of natural bond orbital analysis. The
stereoinversion pathways proposed in this work may proceed via photoirradiation
in the ISM, which though can be revealed by exploring the excited-state
potential energy surface. In this context, the spectroscopic data
generated in this work can provide valuable assistance toward the
astrophysical detection of chiral molecules in outer space.

1 Introduction
Despite
decades of human efforts, the origin of biohomochirality
(the favorability toward only one kind of handedness) in molecules,
for example, which is exhibited by the amino acids still remained
unanswered.1−5 Although amino acids are one of the most essential elements of life
on the earth, the proposed mechanisms,2 for their synthesis on the prebiotic earth, do not provide enough
evidence about their preference toward only L-enantiomeric form.6 Besides the existing terrestrial proposals,2 according to one of the astrochemical hypotheses,
which is being looked quite actively now-a-days,7−9 it is believed
that the amino acids synthesized in the interstellar medium (ISM)
were delivered in sufficient enantiomeric excess to the earth via
astrophysical objects such as meteoroids, asteroids or comets. This
in fact is based on several reports on the detection of significant
enantiomeric excess of L-amino acids in meteoritic samples,10−12 suggesting their presence in the outer space bodies. The recent
discovery of propylene oxide in molecular cloud Sagittarius B2(N),13 the first chiral molecule ever to be confirmed
in any star-forming region, is revolutionary in this field because
it opens up the door to search for other chiral molecules such as
amino acids and sugars, to be present in the ISM. However, there
are several studies, but mainly speculative ones, on the probable
presence of important chiral molecules in the ISM.14−18

Several experimental studies5,15,18,19 had suggested
the synthesis of
proteinogenic as well as nonproteinogenic amino acids in ISM by simulating
the interstellar or circumstellar ice analogues. The latter are a
gaseous mixture of basic molecules such as CO, CO2, CH4, CH3OH, NH3, and H2O, which
when irradiated with the photons of suitable energy, for example,
UV,20−22 gamma,23,24 or even highly energetic
protons,25 result into the precursors of
amino acids and subsequent acid hydrolysis of which leads to the amino
acids. The amino acid of interest in the present work is aspartic
acid, which is also proposed to be formed in several investigations
focusing on the synthesis of astrochemical molecules. For example,
a study by Meinert et al.19 reported aspartic
acid among a total of 26 amino acids synthesized using a mixture of
H2O, CH3OH, and NH3 in the presence
of UV light. Besides this, Takano et al.25 synthesized aspartic acid by bombarding a mixture of H2O, CO, and NH3 with energetic protons. Moreover, further
irradiation of the amino acid precursors by circularly polarized UV
light results in asymmetric synthesis of amino acids.25 The mechanism for the synthesis of amino acids can be ascertained
using the one suggested by Miller,26 via
Strecker synthesis,27 as illustrated in Figure 1. Aspartic acid can
result from the conversion of β-hydrogen of alanine to carboxylic
acid,28 where alanine is expected to be
formed from the hydrolysis of 2-amminopropionitrile (2-APN). The latter’s
presence in the ISM is only speculated till date, but it is being
intensively searched there, though in the lab it can be readily prepared
from the condensation of methanal and ammonia through an achiral imine
intermediate. Note that aspartic acid itself has yet not been detected
in the ISM. However, an alternate mechanism for the synthesis of aspartic
acid, from the elementary molecular species (NH3, CO2, HCN, CH2, and H2O) already detected
in the ISM, can be proposed based on the study of Maeda and Ohno,29 on the formation of glycine, as summarized in Figure 1. The addition of
methylene to glycine followed by carboxylation and isomerization can
result in aspartic acid through achiral ammonium ylide intermediates.

Figure 1 Plausible
mechanistic routes toward the synthesis of aspartic acid
from the elementary molecular species detected in the ISM.

Aspartic acid has one unique property that it is
susceptible to
chiral inversion in living organisms.30 This property of aspartic acid has been used to determine the age
of living and nonliving things through carbon dating.31 However, the asymmetry in amino acids synthesized in the
ISM is believed to be due to irradiation by circularly polarized UV
light.5,25 Therefore, it is quite fascinating to reveal
its mechanism for stereoinversion under conditions akin to ISM. For
past many decades, the researchers have paid considerable attention
to the isomerization reactions occurring in the ISM.32−35 For example, in nitrile/isonitrile (HCN/HNC) isomerization, HCN
is considerably stable than HNC (by ca. 55 kJ/mol), with an isomerization
barrier of 124 kJ/mol, but both the isomers are found to be equally
abundant in the ISM particularly at low temperatures.32 In one of our previous quantum mechanical computational
study,36 we proposed the gas-phase pathways
for stereoinversion in one of the probable candidates for extraterrestrial
chiral molecule, namely, 2-APN, which is supposed to be an important
intermediate in the amino acid synthesis in the ISM as depicted in Figure 1. Such investigations
had also been carried out for the amino acids alanine37 and serine38 and very recently
by our research group on threonine, an amino acid with two stereocenters.39

In the present work, through advanced
quantum mechanical computations,
we perform a systematic search for the mechanistic pathways of the
gas-phase stereoinversion in aspartic acid while revealing the intermediate
and transition-state (TS) species connecting its enantiomers. Notably,
the prediction of intermediates along the stereoinversion pathways
of molecules can aid in the detection of molecules in ISM, for which
computational quantum mechanical spectroscopic investigations play
an integral role.40−43 It can be used to identify the ISM molecules by creating a computational
spectroscopic database for the intermediates explored along the reaction
routes of molecule of interest and then matching the computed spectral
pattern with those observed through the spectrometers on space probes
and space observatories. In this aspect, the rotational spectroscopy
has become an inevitable tool in the field of astronomy because of
the fact that the low temperature in the ISM’s molecular clouds
maintains the molecules in their electronic and vibrational ground
state, thereby limiting the infrared emissions from this part of the
outer space. For example, the spectrum of the giant molecular cloud,
Orion nebula, consists of many sharp lines but only corresponding
to the rotational transitions.40 The vibrational
transitions may be observed at the periphery of the dense molecular
clouds as well as in the diffuse interstellar clouds, where molecular
excitations may not be a rare phenomenon as the high-energy photons
emitted by the hot stars may excite them.41,42 Keeping this in the view, computational rotational and vibrational
spectroscopic studies of aspartic acid and important intermediates
along the proposed stereoisomerization pathways have been performed
in this work, in particular, accounting for the vibrational corrections
to the rotational constants and anharmonic effects in the vibrational
transitions. However, note that the present work explores the stereoinversion
pathways that require the swapping of groups around the chiral center,
which may be facilitated by photoirradiation. However, a search over
the excited-state potential energy surface (PES) will be necessary
to establish the mechanism of such photoreactions, whereas the present
study is restricted only to the exploration of ground-state PES as
described in the next section.

2 Computational Methodology
Although aspartic acid is abundant in nature in its L-form, energetically
both l- and d-aspartic acids are the same except
for their optical rotation. Therefore, in the present work, only the
L-form, the enantiomer with (S)-configuration, has been considered
for investigation. Note that in the present work, we are mainly interested
in locating an appropriate achiral intermediate along the pathways
that may facilitate stereoinversion. The stereoinversion pathways
connecting various equilibrium structures (EQs) through TSs were explored
using a global reaction route mapping (GRRM) strategy of Ohno and
co-workers,44−49 employing appropriate quantum mechanical methods. Note that to trace
the reaction pathways, the exploration of the PES of a molecular system
of even a few atoms is computationally quite challenging. Therefore,
the initial computations for the search of various EQs and TSs were
performed at a lower level of quantum mechanical method, namely, the
DFT/B3LYP/6-31G level of the density functional theory (DFT), using
a hybrid Becke-three-parameter-Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP)50,51 exchange–correlation functional of DFT and 6-31G Gaussian
basis set. The geometries of the located EQs and TSs at the B3LYP/6-31G
level were further refined using a meta-hybrid Minnesota exchange
correlation functional,52 M06-2X of the
DFT, while employing Dunning-style correlation-consistent triple zeta
basis set, aug-cc-pVTZ, (aug)mented by the diffuse functions. The
geometry optimization was followed by the harmonic vibrational frequency
calculations to check the nature of each stationary point, that is,
minima or TS depending on the number of imaginary frequencies and
to obtain the zero-point energy (ZPE) correction. Any species with
one and only one imaginary frequency is designated as TS, whereas
minima should have all real frequencies. The final refinement for
energy of the species along the proposed pathways was carried out
using coupled-cluster (CC) calculations53 at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVDZ//DFT/M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ level of the theory
as well as using a density fitting (DF) DF-CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//DFT/M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ
method.54 Note that we had tried to choose
the best quantum mechanical method that can be afforded using the
computational resources available with us. All computations using
the GRRM were performed in assistance with the Gaussian 09 quantum
mechanical software package,55 except for
the computations at the DF-CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//DFT/M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ
level, for which PSI-code quantum mechanical software package56 was utilized employing an energy convergence
criterion of 10–8.

The aforementioned DFT
methods are generally believed to be not
much accurate in determining the centrifugal distortion constants,
and therefore, at the first sight, the DFT-computed force field may
seem to be inappropriate for the investigations being carried out
in the present work. In particular, the rotational spectra being computed
in the present work are likely affected by the internal motion, which
may not be accounted by the DFT. However, in spite of these shortcomings
of the DFT method employed here, we were able to successfully trace
the achiral intermediates, which are responsible for the stereoinversion
of aspartic acid. To further compare the results predicted using the
DFT method and check their reliability, the computations were also
carried out using ab initio Møller–Plesset second-order
perturbation theory (MP2)57 at the level
of MP2/6-31+G(d,p) method employing a 6-31+G(d,p) Gaussian basis set.
However, the vibrationally corrected rotational constants calculated
using the DFT/M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ method are observed to be more accurate
(see later).

Initially, an attempt was made to find the stereoinversion
pathways
with low energy barrier (as in our previous studies),36−39 employing a “first only” restrictive option of GRRM,
but it resulted in only various conformers (12 to be exact) of aspartic
acid, as provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). To trace the low energy barrier pathways, the PES was
also searched by following the five largest anharmonic downward distortions
employing LAAD = 5 option during the GRRM search, but even using this,
an achiral stationary point relevant to stereoinversion could not
be located. This indicates a high energy barrier for stereoinversion
in aspartic acid, but our further attempt to locate a TS along the
stereoinversion pathways was complicated by the hydrogen bonding interactions
among −NH2, −COOH, and −CH2COOH groups in aspartic acid. These H-bonding interactions in the
amino acids can be categorized into three types, being designated
as I: {(NH2)N–H···O=C (α-COOH
in cis-confirmation)}, II: {(NH2)N···H–O
(α-COOH in trans-confirmation)}, and III: {(NH2)N–H···O–H
(α-COOH in cis-confirmation)}.58,59 In the present
work, the global minimum (as located in the GRRM search) at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G
level of the theory was found to be EQ0# as depicted in Figure 2a, which has also
been reported to be the most stable (conformer Ib-1) in a previous
study by Sanz et al. at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level of the theory,59 in which type-I H-bonding interactions were
predicted. However, its another lowest-energy rotational conformer
EQ0 depicted in Figure 2b and reported as conformer Ia-1 by Sanz et al. at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p)
level of theory is predicted to be 129 kcal/mol more stable at the
more appropriate M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ level of the quantum mechanical
method than that predicted by the B3LYP/6-31G method. Note that although
EQ0 is not the global conformer, different groups attached to the
chiral carbon are so oriented as to facilitate their suitable migrations,
resulting in stereoinversion as traced by the GRRM (see next section).
Subsequently, all the results and discussion are presented with respect
to EQ0.

level of the theory, in which type-I H-bonding interactions are shown,

theory, depicting the bond angles (in degrees) in (S)-EQ0, (c) depicting the bond lengths (in Å) in (R)-EQ0, and (d) depicting the dihedral angles (in degrees) in (S)-EQ0. Note that all the geometrical parameters coincide
in both the enantiomers; these are depicted in different isomers only
for the sake of clarity. The nomenclature in square brackets is adapted
from the study of Sanz et al (ref (59)).

Coming to our primary motive of tracing stereoinversion routes,
after failing to locate a low-lying TS in the initial GRRM search
using first-only and LAAD = 5 options, further computations using
two-point scaled hypersphere search and intrinsic reaction coordinates
were carried out through the GRRM to intuitively trace the required
TSs and intermediates, particularly the achiral intermediate species
and to establish the right connectivity among them. However, note
that the stereoinversion pathways traced in this work depend on the
assumption that the GRRM has sufficiently sampled the chemical space
of the reaction system being investigated. Further, the energy values
(including the ZPE correction) for all the species located along the
proposed stereoinversion pathways, depicted in Figures 3 and 4, are provided
in Table 1. The relative
energy profiles along the pathways are further depicted in Figures 5 and 6, whereas the Gibbs free-energy change and its temperature
dependence are analyzed in Table 4. Besides these, the natural bond orbital (NBO)60 charge analysis for the relevant stereoinversion
pathways is presented in Table 3, which was utilized in deciding whether the [−H] migrates
as an atom or a proton (see later).

Further, the species explored along the proposed stereoinversion
pathways were characterized using computational rotational and vibrational
spectroscopy. The most relevant spectroscopic parameters, provided
in Table 2 and Tables
S2–S4 (Supporting Information),
were computed using different quantum mechanical methods. To accurately
determine these parameters, the quartic and cubic force fields are
required for calculating the vibrational corrections to rotational
constants as well as anharmonic effects, which are obtained using
second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2),61 as implemented in Gaussian 0955 (see the input file provided in the Supporting Information). In the present work, for the experimentally known
conformers EQ0# (Ib-1) and EQ0 (Ia-1), these calculations
were attempted at different levels of theory, namely, MP2/6-31+G(d,p),
M06-2X/cc-pVDZ, M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ, and M06-2X/cc-pVTZ as well as
using the B3LYP/SNSD method. The latter has recently been forwarded
as a computationally less-expensive approach for such calculations.61

The experimental and calculated
values of vibrationally corrected
ground-state rotational constants for conformers EQ0# and
EQ0 are compared in Table 2 and Table S3 (Supporting Information). Clearly, those computed with the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ method exhibit
greater accuracy than any other theory/basis set attempted here, in
fact better than those obtained using the cc-pVTZ basis set, clearly
indicating the role of long-range diffuse functions as had also been
highlighted in the approach of Puzzarini et al.61 However, our computations using aug-cc-pVTZ could not be
completed mainly because of the limited computational resources. Nevertheless,
it is reasonable to accept the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ level for rotational
spectroscopic analysis presented in this work. For a more accurate
prediction of rotational spectroscopic parameters, the state-of-the-art
composite schemes employing CC methods through the CFOUR program package62 may be followed as suggested by Puzzarini et
al.,61,63,64 although our
attempt to employ this scheme failed at CCSD(T) and MP2 levels of
the theory as recommended in these studies. The relevant spectroscopic
parameters for simulating the rotational spectra of different intermediates
explored along the stereoinversion pathways are further provided in Table 2, whereas those for
the TSs along the pathways are provided in Table S4 (Supporting Information).

However, for the computations
of anharmonic vibrational frequencies,
the meta-hybrid DFT functional M06-2X is known to give inaccurate
results.65 Hence, for the vibrational spectra,
calculations using MP2/6-31+G(d,p) are utilized. Note that all these
computations are quite expensive for the size of the molecular species
being considered in the present work. The harmonic and anharmonic
frequency values along with the potential energy distribution (PED)
analysis of all the fundamental modes of vibration of the two important
conformers of aspartic acid (EQ0# and EQ0) and other EQs
located along the feasible pathways in this study are listed in Table
S1 (Supporting Information). The PED is
performed using the Vibrational Energy Distribution Analysis (VEDA4)
program of Jamroz.66 The calculated anharmonic
frequency values for the global minimum conformer EQ0# are
further compared with the experimental values67 in Table 5.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Stereoinversion Pathways
It is well-established37−39 that for stereoinversion to occur
in chiral molecules with one stereocenter,
the molecular structure (which can be a TS or an intermediate along
the stereoinversion route) should possess an achiral geometry. This
can happen provided one of the groups around the stereocenter migrates
to any one of the remaining three groups (depending on whether the
group can accept the incoming moiety). However, all the intuitively
inferred shifts are unlikely to occur; only the chemically possible
shifts can take place such that any subsequent dissociation is less
feasible than the prospective isomerization. For instance, in the
present case, the four groups around stereocentric carbon (C*) are
as follows: −H, −NH2, −COOH, and −CH2COOH. The shift of [−H] to −NH2 is
chemically possible because the lone pair of nitrogen atom can accept
proton, but this may lead to dissociation, resulting in NH3 (see later), though there may be exceptions such as in the formation
of ammonium ylides (R1)R2C––+NH3. However, the reverse (shift of
−NH2 to −H) is improbable because the H atom
is unlikely to accept the incoming group. Similarly, the amino group
(−NH2) cannot shift to the carboxylic group because
the resulting intermediate will have the negative charge on the carbonyl
oxygen and positive charge on the central carbon, which is likely
to drive the system back into the original form (see Supporting Information, Figure S2). Therefore, depending upon
the possible migrations, only five pathways (depicted in Figures 3 and 4) could be located in the present work, which can be further
categorized in two ways: one is the shift of −H to the other
groups and the other is the shift of −CH2COOH. One
of these five routes seems to be infeasible wrt stereoinversion of
aspartic acid because no achiral stationary point could be located
along this pathway (see later). It should be noted that out of the
various possible rotational conformers of aspartic acid (depicted
in Supporting Information, Figure S1),
the conformer EQ0 serves as the starting EQ for all the five possible
shifts as discussed in detail below.

3.1.1 Shift
of [−H]
3.1.1.1 Shift to the [−NH2]
Group
For the stereoinversion of aspartic acid through the
shift of [−H] from central asymmetric carbon (C*) to the amino
group, as depicted along Path 1 in Figure 3, the conformer (S)-EQ0
must change into conformer (S)-EQ1 via TS0/1 with
a barrier height of 63.32 kcal/mol. In TS0/1, note that the C*–H
distance is 1.328 Å and the N–H distance is 1.193 Å.
This transformation is endergonic as analyzed in Table 1. Note that EQ1 is a zwitterion
ammonium ylide species with a negative charge on central carbon (a
stereogenic carbanion) and a positive charge on the nitrogen atom,
that is, +NH3–C(R)COOH, but
this intermediate is relatively unstable than the conformer EQ0. In
the subsequent step, (S)-EQ1 may go back either to
(S)-EQ0 with a barrier height of 32.06 kcal/mol or
invert into (R)-EQ1 with a stereoinversion energy
barrier of 3.33 kcal/mol via the achiral TS1 of Cs symmetry, which is again ammonium ylide
species as also depicted in Figure 1. The former conversion is thermodynamically quite
feasible because EQ0 is highly stabilized wrt EQ1, but the latter
is kinetically more probable because the barrier height for stereoinversion
is quite low along which quantum tunneling may occur because of transfer
of hydrogen atom or proton along this path.

Further, (R)-EQ1 has the same fate as that of (S)-EQ1;
therefore, there is a possibility that it may finally invert into
(R)-EQ0 via (R)-TS0/1, resulting
into the enantiomer of opposite chirality. However, this is only possible
if there is any probability of forming EQ1 intermediate from EQ0,
which in fact seems less likely to occur thermally as evident from
ΔG values in Table 4. In fact, in living systems, stereoinversion
in aspartic acid occurs through catalytic pathways.68 Further, to check whether [−H] migrates to [−NH2] as a proton or as the H atom, the NBO analysis was carried
out. From the NBO atomic charge on relevant atomic sites as given
in Table 3, it can be inferred that it is migrating as a proton
because the natural atomic charge on H(3) changes to +0.495e in TS0/1 from +0.213e in EQ0, whereas
at stereocenter (C*), it increases from −0.135e in EQ0 to −0.297e in TS0/1.

3.1.1.2 Shift to the [−COOH] Group
The second pathway
Path 2 presented in Figure 3 involves the migration of [−H] from
chiral carbon to the carboxyl group carbon atom in (S)-EQ0. This results into an intermediate (S)-EQ2
via TS0/2 in which the distance between the stereocentric carbon
and the proton to be shifted is 1.669 Å compared to a distance
of 1.252 Å for the C–H bond to be formed between carboxyl
carbon and the migrating proton. The NBO charge analysis in this case
suggests the shift of the hydrogen atom instead of proton as the natural
atomic charge on the migrating hydrogen in this case is +0.120e (see Table 3). Similar to the previous pathway (Path 1), here also, the first
step is endergonic in nature with a Gibbs free-energy barrier height
of 52.90 kcal/mol, which is ∼10 kcal/mol less than that along
Path 1 and hence, stereoinversion along Path 2 is more probable than
Path 1. Further transformation of (S)-EQ2 into (R)-EQ2 is feasible through the achiral TS2 (Cs), which resembles an imine R1(C=NH)R2 as in Strecker synthesis illustrated in Figure 1. The energy barrier
for stereoinversion in this case is also quite low, although the possibility
of retention of configuration does exist as discussed previously for
Path 1. Note that the MP2/6-31+G(d,p) method predicts the symmetry
of TS2 to be C1. However, the geometries
predicted by the DFT methods are known to be more reliable than MP2;
therefore, the achiral TS2 can be trusted.

3.1.1.3 Shift
to the [−CH2COOH]
Group
This pathway though improbable is unusual in the sense
that unlike the first two pathways, it involves double migration instead
of one as depicted in Figure 3. The first step is the formation of (S)-EQ3,
which is an epoxide, via TS0/3 involving a concerted movement of
methylenic H and carboxylic O atoms (note that EQ3 is similar to propylene
oxide, which is first ever chiral species to be detected in the ISM).
However, the activation energy for the formation of EQ3 is found to
be quite high (97.92 kcal/mol). This is followed by the conversion
of (S)-EQ3 into (S)-EQ3′
(a dihydroxy amino acid) via another high barrier (S)-TS3/3′, involving again a concerted shift of H and O atoms
but this time at different locations. Finally, (S)-EQ3′ isomerizes to (R)-EQ3′ via
the achiral TS3 (Cs)
which in fact is an achiral imine. The NBO charge analysis reveals
that in this case as well, the hydrogen travels as an atom, in the
first step, either H(6) or H(7) with charge +0.2e shifts to C(8), and in the second step, H(3) with charge +0.284e goes to C(5). Further, this path is also specific because
it is found to be possible only for the migration of proton from central
carbon to the −CH2COOH group because one of the
methylenic protons is shifted to the carbonyl carbon. However, the
migration of −NH2 or −COOH to −CH2COOH could not be traced, which may be due to the steric effects
and the requirement of a perfect orientation. Nonetheless, this pathway
seems to be least probable because of the presence of two high energy
barriers (see later).

3.1.2 Shift
of [−CH2COOH]
3.1.2.1 Shift
to the Amino Group [−NH2]
The migration
of the −CH2COOH
group to the amino group leads to the conversion of EQ0 into EQ4 via
TS0/4 but with a barrier height of 102.22 kcal/mol as depicted in Figure 4. (S)-EQ4 changes into (R)-EQ4 via the achiral TS4
(Cs), which is actually
an ammonium ylide. In TS4, one of the N–H protons is shared
by the carboxylic group (C=O) of the −COOH group, similar
to that observed along Paths 2 and 3. However, here also, MP2/6-31+G(d,p)
disagrees with the prediction of DFT that the symmetry of TS4 is Cs.

3.1.2.2 Shift
to the Carboxylic Group [−COOH]
Contrary to the −NH2 shift, an attempt to locate
the pathway involving migration of the −CH2COOH
group to the −COOH group failed. Through this shift, the conformer
(S)-EQ0 does convert into an intermediate (S)-EQ5 through TS0/5 as depicted in Figure 4, but its subsequent conversion to an achiral
intermediate/TS could not be traced despite several attempts because
of the requirement of Cs symmetry at two consecutive carbon atoms, that is, −CH2–C(OH)2–, as can be seen from EQ5
in Figure 4. During
the optimization of planar TS in this case, the system tends to go
out of plane at one of these carbon positions, resulting into the
geometry with point chirality.

3.1.3 Relative
Feasibility of Proposed Stereoinversion
Pathways
The potential energy profiles of the aforementioned
stereoinversion pathways in aspartic acid at MP2/6-31+G(d,p) and at
the CC levels of the theory are given in Figures 5 and 6, respectively,
whereas Table 4 compares the Gibbs free-energy change along
these pathways. Comparing the feasibility trend of the possible chiral
inversion pathways when analyzed using the DFT and CCSD//DFT methods,
it can be seen that the second pathway (Path 2), which involves the
shift of proton to the carboxylic group is the most favorable pathway
(both in terms of relative energy and Gibbs free-energy change). The
transition state species TS0/2 and TS2 (Cs), as well as the intermediate EQ2 along this route
lay much lower in energy than the respective stationary points of
other pathways. However, note that the MP2 method differs from the
DFT methods on the possibility of Path 2.

a The temperature range, in kelvin
(K), corresponds to different regions of the ISM. The point group
symmetry of achiral TSs is specified in parenthesis. The values depicted
in bold are calculated using the MP2/6-31+G(d,p) method. The values
in parenthesis are the corresponding ZPE-corrected relative energies
(note that these are temperature-independent).

Besides Path 2, another pathway
(Path 1) involving the migration
of proton to the amino group also seems to be probable because the
intermediates and TSs are relatively lower lying in energy than those
along Paths 3 and 4. The results using the MP2/6-31+G(d,p) method
reveal that TS0/4 along Path 4 is lower in energy than the first transtion
state species TS0/3 along Path 3, whereas both the CCSD(T) methods
indicate that TS0/4 is the highest energy barrier. However, along
Path 3, although the system has to go through two high energy barriers:
TS0/3 and TS3/3′, before attaining the achiral planar TS3 (Cs), but the intermediates EQ3
and EQ3′ are relatively more stable than those along Path 4,
making the overall pathway more probable than Path 4. Therefore, it
may be predicted from the CCSD(T)//DFT energy profiles that the pathways
follow the feasibility trend as Path 2 > Path 1 ≫> Path
3 >
Path 4, with Path 2 being the most feasible though the MP2 method
excludes the possibility of Path 2 and Path 4.

The stereoinversion
pathways proposed were further analyzed for
their relative feasibility under different temperature conditions
of ISM, in particular, ranging from 10 to 1000 K. As this study explored
only the ground-state PES of the aspartic acid, the higher temperature
regions of the ISM are excluded in which case the excited electronic
states become more important. The region of interstellar molecular
clouds ranges from 10 K in cold dense medium to 100 K in diffuse molecular
clouds, where in fact much of the exotic gas-phase interstellar chemistry
has been discovered,69 whereas the temperature
region above 100 K corresponds to the dense “hot cores”
of ISM where the star formation process occurs.70,71 From the analysis presented in Table 4, it can be seen that within the temperature ranges
considered here, the overall change in Gibbs free energy is positive
along all the pathways. The initial step as well as the stereoinversion
step is found to be endergonic, though in the latter’s case
it is <10 kcal/mol. Comparing the overall change in free energy
for the pathways, it is analyzed that stereoinversion is more likely
to occur in the temperature range of 100–500 K. It is to be
noted that this temperature region is already observed to be a source
of complex organic molecules detected in the ISM,70,71 and the present study also found that the temperature region of
100–500 K is more suitable for stereoinversion in aspartic
acid to occur. However, a vast part of the ISM is not under thermal
equilibrium; therefore, the aforementioned usage of the free energy
may not even be valid. Nevertheless, even though the analysis in terms
of Gibbs free energies may not be appropriate here, but as evident
in Table 4 and in Figure 6, the free energies
follow the same trend as the ZPE-corrected energies, which in fact
need not be dependent on the thermal equilibrium conditions.

Further, to compare the probability of stereoinversion to occur
over that of the dissociation of aspartic acid, a few dissociation
channels (DCs) were also traced intuitively, which are listed in Table 1 and depicted in Figure
S3 (Supporting Information). Note that
the DCs (1–3) were searched from the same conformer of aspartic
acid from which the stereoinversion pathways were located. Overall,
three dissociation pathways (from EQ0) and one dissociation path (from
intermediate isomer EQ1 along the stereoinversion Path 1), all endothermic,
were traced, similar to that of DCs recently reported for glycine.72 Comparing the energy barrier along DCs with
that along the most probable stereoinversion pathways (Paths 1 and
2) in Table 1, it is
clearly evident that stereoinversion is more likely to occur than
dissociation, even though the latter is entropically more favored.
For example, the dissociation leading to the formation of H2O and CO requires ca. 20 kcal/mol more than the highest barrier for
stereoinversion along Path 2. However, in glycine, a low-lying DC
leading to ammonia and acetylactone has been revealed by another study.72 The barrier of ca. 46 kcal/mol along this DC
is found to be much lower than the most preferable stereoinversion
pathways proposed for aspartic acid. However, an analogue’s
DC could not be traced in aspartic acid conformer (EQ0) from which
the proposed stereoinversion pathways actually initiate. This may
be due to different groups and their orientation around the stereocenter
in EQ0 than that in glycine. Nevertheless, it is highly likely that
other conformers of aspartic acid and intermediate isomers along the
proposed stereoinversion pathways may dissociate through such channels.
One such DC (DC4) but with a quite high barrier of ca. 80 kcal/mol
(wrt EQ0), listed in Table 1 and depicted in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), was intuitively traced for intermediate isomer
EQ1 along stereoinversion Path 1. However, as evident in Table 1, the conversion of
EQ1 to its counterpart of opposite chirality is associated with much
lower energy barrier than the barrier along DC4. Hence, the dissociation
is unlikely to proceed over stereoinversion even along Path 1.

Furthermore, from the data discussed in the aforementioned analysis,
there may be apprehensions that the proposed stereoinversion pathways
are too slow to proceed and may not even occur on the time scale of
our universe. However, note that it is mainly the initial step which
involves quite high energy barrier, leading to the key intermediate
and TS species. The subsequent steps from these leading finally to
the stereoinversion are in fact quite fast. This is supported by the
conventional TS theory (TST)-computed rate constants provided in the Supporting Information (Table S6), which are
calculated taking into account quantum mechanical tunneling estimated
using an unsymmetrical Eckart’s potential.73 As evident from the computed rate constants, the overall
stereoinversion pathway proposed are kinetically unfavorable despite
involving significant quantum mechanical tunneling. Though the unimolecular
rate constant for the initial step along Path 2, for example, at 298.15
K, is ca. 10–24 s–1 leading to
a key intermediate (EQ2), the subsequent inversion step occurs quite
fast with a rate constant of ca. 109 s–1. Note that the intermediate and TS species traced along the proposed
pathways resemble those commonly observed during the synthesis of
amino acids, for example, an imine intermediate R′(C=NH)R″
in the Strecker synthesis. If the synthesis of amino acids in the
ISM occurs via such intermediates, then the stereoinversion proceeding
through these becomes highly probable, in fact during the synthesis
of amino acids itself. However, once the amino acid is formed, it
may not be possible to invert it because of a very high initial barrier.

3.2 Spectroscopic Analysis
3.2.1 Rotational
Spectral Analysis
The
spectroscopic details of the intermediate isomers along the proposed
gas-phase stereoinversion pathways of aspartic acid can be of utmost
importance, particularly for the investigations related to the detection
of interstellar amino acids. In view of this, vibrationally corrected
rotational and anharmonic vibrational spectral analysis of relevant
species explored along the feasible stereoinversion pathways has been
performed computationally. To quantitatively analyze the nature of
rotational spectra of all the species of interest, “R”
branch transitions have been simulated in ∼1–20 GHz
range using PGOPHER program74 for rotational,
vibrational, and electronic spectra employing the parameters provided
in Table 2 at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ
level of the theory (for the detailed computational procedure, see
the Supporting Information). Note that
the vibrationally corrected ground-state rotational constants computed
at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ level provided the best estimate (to be
reported in the literature) for rotational constants when compared
with the experimental results available for the global conformer of
aspartic acid. For the latter, the agreement with experimental data
for rotational constants, B and C, is found to be within 1 MHz, and for constant A, it is within 10 MHz, which is even better than those predicted
by the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) method, the best known in the existing literature.59 Therefore, this level of theory can be taken
to be quite reliable, though in no way, it is comparable with the
state-of-the-art composite scheme forwarded by the groups of Barone
and Puzzarini (see ref (64) and references therein).

Aspartic acid and related intermediates
along the pathways are analyzed to be near asymmetric top molecules,
with EQ4 being the most symmetrical according to the Ray’s
asymmetry value that depends on the rotational constants and determines
the position of any transition. The simplified rotational spectra
(without including 14N nuclear hyperfine splitting) of
isomers EQ0#, EQ0, EQ1, EQ2, EQ3, EQ3′, and EQ4
are depicted in Figure 7. These spectra depict the transitions with a rotational quantum
number J = 2 ← 1 (as in Figure 7a for isomers EQ1, EQ3′, and EQ4)
and J ≤ 6 (as in Figure 7b for isomers EQ1, EQ3′, and EQ4),
whereas the characteristic transitions for other isomers (EQ0#, EQ0, EQ2, and EQ3) are exemplified in Figure 7c.

Figure 7 Computed rotational spectra in the frequency
range of 1–20
GHz at T = 10 K for isomers EQ1, EQ3′, and
EQ4 (a) with J = 2 ← 1; (b) with J ≤ 6; and (c) for isomers EQ0#, EQ0, EQ2, and EQ3
but with J = 2 ← 1. The marked transitions
are labeled as , where J and K are conventional rotational quantum numbers
for near-prolate asymmetric
tops. a-type, b-type, and c-type transitions are specified in red, blue, and green
text, respectively (note that these are depicted only for illustration
purpose to reveal the type of spectra). The spectra depicted are generated
using parameters of Table 2 calculated with the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ method. Note that
the normalized intensity has been specified, for the absolute intensity
(in nm2 MHz molecule–1), use the conversion
4.16 × 10–5 × freq (MHz) × normalized
intensity.

Note that the strength of any particular type of transition
depends
on the electric dipole moment (μ) components along the (a, b, c) axis and on the
distribution of energy states, which in turn depends on the temperature,
hence all the spectra are compared at a fixed temperature of 10 K
akin to the cold region of ISM. Therefore, as μa values of EQ1, EQ3′, and EQ4 are greater
than the μb and μc values, these species exhibit the a-type transitions, as depicted for EQ1, EQ3′, and EQ4 in Figure 7a, with the most
intense transitions following the selection rule: ΔKa = 0 and ΔKc = 1, −1, in terms of the second rotational
quantum number K. In fact, a-type
transitions are easier to locate in a spectrum because such transitions
occur in a band. The most intense transition in the band, J0J′′ ← J0J″″ (where prime refers to the upper
state and double prime to the lower state), is the characteristic
of the a-type spectra that repeats periodically after
(B0 + C0)
MHz. This rule, however, is found to be strictly followed only in
the case of EQ4 as evident in Figure 7b. It is observed that the greater the deviation in
Ray’s asymmetry value from −1 (as in prolate symmetric
top), the more the variation is in the predicted frequency values
of transitions as per this rule.

Further, because μa ≫>
μb and μc for EQ4, the spectra are predicted to be comparatively less
complex than those of EQ1 and EQ3′, with a-type transitions dominating the entire spectrum. However, weak μb- and μc-type transitions are also present in the spectra of EQ1 and EQ3′,
which seem to complicate the spectra. For other isomers: EQ0, EQ2,
and EQ3, μb is the largest value;
therefore, b-type transitions, following the selection
rule: ΔKa = 1,
−1 and ΔKc = 1, −1, are predicted to be the most intense. The difference
between μb and μa increases in the order EQ2 < EQ3 < EQ0; therefore,
extremely weak a-type transitions are predicted for
EQ0 than the b-type as depicted in Figure 7c. Similarly, extremely weak c-type transitions are predicted for EQ0 and EQ2, though
these are predicted to be relatively more intense in EQ3. These species
can be identified by the position of a characteristic doublet in b-type transitions, J2J′-1′ ← J1J″-1″ and J2J′-2′ ← J1J″″, centered at (3A0 + C0 + (B0 – C0)/2) + (B0 + C0)(J″ – 1) and separated by (B0 – C0)/2J′J″. The location of J1J′′ ← J0J″″ transition is predicted at (A0 + C0 + 2C0J″) as specified in Figure 7c for EQ0, EQ2, and
EQ3.

The global minimum EQ0# can be characterized
by c-type transitions because of μc being the largest of all the three dipole moments.
However,
as μa and μb are of comparable magnitude with that of μc, weak b- and c-type transitions are also present. To identify this species, one
can locate J1J′-1′ ← J0J″″ transition that occurs at (A0 + B0 + 2B0J″). Note that while predicting the location of transitions
using the aforementioned conventional relations, it is necessary to
consider the effect of magnitude of Ray’s asymmetric parameter
as well as higher J values.75 For EQ0# and EQ0, the most intense transitions in the
range of 1–20 GHz have been calculated with the rotational
quantum numbers J ≤ 6 and K ≤ 2 following the selection rules: ΔKa = 0, 1, −1 and ΔKc = 0, 1, −1 and are
provided in the Supporting Information (Table
S2), which also compares these with the available experimental data.59 Notably, the agreement between computed and
experimental data, for the most intense transitions in EQ0# and EQ0, is found to be within <100 MHz. Therefore, the rotational
spectra for other isomers predicted here could be reliable in resolving
the experimental transitions for the specified frequency region in
cold interstellar clouds.

3.2.2 Vibrational Spectral
Analysis
Further,
for the vibrational spectra, harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequency
analysis at the MP2/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory was carried out to
characterize all the normal modes of gas-phase aspartic acid and important
intermediates relevant to its stereoisomerization pathways. Each fundamental
mode is analyzed using potential-energy distribution (PED) through
VEDA4 program.66 Aspartic acid and all
the related intermediates are nonlinear with 16 atoms; hence, a total
of 42 active fundamental modes are associated with them as listed
in the Supporting Information (Table S1).
The PED analysis of the lowest energy conformer EQ0# along
with anharmonic vibrational frequencies and the corresponding intensities
is provided in Table 5. The experimental values but available for
the solid sample of l-aspartic acid67 are also compared. It is quite evident from Table 5 that except for the vibrations at high frequencies
(due to hydrogen bonding interactions), most of the gas-phase anharmonic
frequencies are in good agreement with the experimental (solid sample)
values than the harmonic vibrational frequencies (provided in Table S1). For example, an intense anharmonic
O–H stretch associated with the two −COOH groups of
gas-phase EQ0# is predicted to appear at 3595 and 3592
cm–1, whereas in the solid sample, it is shifted
to a much lower value of 3022 cm–1, mainly due to
the intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. Similarly, weak
asymmetric and symmetric stretch for NH2 and CH2 is observed to be at a lower frequency in the solid sample than
those predicted in the gas phase. The two most intense −C=O
stretch is predicted to appear at 1787 and 1775 cm–1 compared to 1691 cm–1 observed in the solid sample.
Except for these high-frequency vibrations, there exists a close agreement
(within 10 cm–1) between other gas-phase anharmonic
frequencies and the corresponding experimental solid sample values,
particularly those observed at low frequencies as evident in Table 5. For example, anharmonic
C–H stretch predicted at 2983 cm–1 is observed
at an experimental solid sample value of 2999 cm–1. Similarly, scissoring-type bending vibrations for NH2 and CH2 predicted at 1644 and 1459 cm–1 are experimentally observed at 1628 and 1450 cm–1, respectively. In fact, most of the fundamental vibrations at medium
and low frequencies match well with the experimental values, keeping
in view of the fact that the present predictions are for the isolated
gas-phase aspartic acid molecule in the neutral state as may be envisaged
in the ISM, compared to the solid sample experimental data. The latter
though may well correspond to a zwitterionic form accompanied by intermolecular
and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. Also note that the
anharmonic frequencies predicted here can be directly employed to
characterize the fundamental vibrational modes without using any ad-hoc
scaling factor often required in the case of harmonic frequencies.
Moreover, the PED analysis provided along with corresponding intensity
values can be utilized while detecting aspartic acid or its intermediates
proposed along the stereoinversion pathways in the ISM.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, using quantum mechanical computations, four gas-phase
pathways for stereoinversion in aspartic acid were traced, either
involving proton and hydrogen atom transfer or migration of CH2COOH around the stereogenic carbon atom. The stereoinversion
pathways, Path 1 and Path 2, proceeding through the shift of a proton
to NH2 and COOH groups, respectively, were found to be
more probable than the dissociation pathways searched for aspartic
acid. Stereoinversion is proposed to be more feasible via Path 2 and
may be observed in the “hot cores” of the protostars
rather than the cold denser region of molecular clouds. Besides this,
the TS species along the proposed stereochemical pathways are of types,
R1(R2)C––+NH3 and R′(C=NH)R″, which resembles,
respectively, the achiral zwitterionic ammonium ylide and imine intermediates,
the latter being a key intermediate in the Strecker synthesis of chiral
amino acids. The quantum mechanically computed vibrationally corrected
rotational and anharmonic vibrational spectral data provided in this
work for the aspartic acid, its intermediates, and TS species along
the proposed stereoinversion pathways will be quite helpful for the
detection of chiral amino acids in the ISM.

Note that the present
work has explored truly unimolecular gas-phase
isomerization pathways leading to stereoinversion in molecules. This
is most likely to happen where the molecular density is too low for
a collisional event to occur. The molecular density in ISM ranges
from ∼103 to 106 molecules per cm3 in the cold molecular clouds to only a few molecules per
cm3 in the hot regions. Therefore, ISM is a likely place
where such gas-phase unimolecular stereoinversion could be observed.
Such an isomerization reaction, however, may be induced by photoirradiation.
However, to trace the pathways of photoreactions, a computational
exploration of the excited-state PES will be necessary, which is likely
to be complicated by conical intersections.72
