A facile fabrication
strategy of transparent and upconversion photoluminescent
nylon 6 (PA6) nanofiber mats was developed based on PA6 nanofiber
mats, carboxylic acid-functionalized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP-COOH),
and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution. UCNP-COOH were prepared
by a solvothermal method, followed by the ligand exchange process.
The electrospinning method and the spin-coating process were employed
to combine PA6 nanofiber mats with UCNP-COOH and PMMA to introduce
upconversion photoluminescent properties and transparency into the
nanocomposite mats, respectively. The prepared UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA
nanofiber mats are transparent and exhibit green emission, which are
similar to UCNP-COOH when they were excited under 980 nm laser. The
upconversion luminescent intensity of the functional nanofiber mats
can be tailored by adjusting the weight fraction of UCNP-COOH as fillers.
This facile strategy can be readily used to other types of intriguing
nanocomposites for diverse applications.

Introduction
Owing to their distinctive
photoluminescent properties of turning
near-infrared light to shorter wavelength radiation,1,2 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) have drawn growing attention in
the fields of bioimaging,3,4 photodynamic therapy,5,6 three-dimensional display technologies,7,8 and
photovoltaics,9 to name but a few.10,11 Polymer nanocomposite materials with photoluminescence and transparent
properties are promising for many technological applications because
of the advantage of polymers,12,13 including excellent
processability, lightweight, flexibility, and excellent impact resistance.14,15 Recently, UCNPs were introduced into polymer matrixes [such as polystyrene,16,17 poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),18,19 polydimethylsiloxane,20 etc.] to prepare bulk polymer nanocomposites
or thin film which may be used in various fields.21

Currently, the electrospinning technology offers
a direct way to
produce nanofibers with diameters ranging from tens to hundreds of
nanometers.22,23 Moreover, a variety of functional
nanomaterials can be incorporated into electrospun nanofibers by the
co-electrospinning method.24,25 The co-electrospinning
process was performed by simply mixing functional nanoparticles and
polymeric solution in the same solvent environment and then electrospinning
to fabricate functional nanofibers with special properties.26 For example, flexible and freestanding UCNP/PMMA
nanofiber mats with upconversion photoluminescent properties were
fabricated by combining oleic acid (OA)-capped UCNP with PMMA nanofibers.27 UCNP/PVP nanofibers were also prepared by the
electrospinning strategy.28 However, all
these thin composite nanofiber mats combined with UCNPs are not transparent,
and so, they are limited when used in some areas, such as optical
devices, sensors, and so on.29

Combined
with PMMA,30 polycaprolactone,
and polyaniline, respectively, photoluminescent nylon 6 (PA6) nanofibers
have been used to prepare polymer nanocomposites owing to their outstanding
mechanical properties.31,32 Meanwhile, the nanocomposites
can show the function of the nanoparticles embedded into the nanofibers.33 However, with the introduction of functional
nanoparticles into the nanofiber mats, transmittance properties of
the samples prepared by electrospinning got poorer.34 To improve the transparency of the nanofiber mats, various
techniques were developed to prepare transparent composites, such
as casting, melt mixing, and hot-press method;35 some transparent polymer matrixes were used to combine
with the nanofiber mats to produce the composite mats. However, no
reports concerning the introduction of UCNPs into transparent nanofiber
mats have appeared so far. Thus, in this work, carboxylic acid-functionalized
upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP-COOH), PA6, and PMMA were combined
to prepare transparent and upconversion photoluminescent UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA
nanofiber mats.

Herein, nanofiber mats with tunable upconversion
luminescent and
transparent properties were fabricated by a combination of co-electrospinning
and spin-coating methods by combining electrospun PA6 fibers, UCNP-COOH,
and PMMA. The procedure includes the preparation of UCNP-COOH, which
is prepared by the solvothermal method, followed by the ligand exchange
method, then co-electrospinning of UCNP-COOH/PA6 nanofiber mats by
using the mixed solution of PA6 and UCNP-COOH in formic acid solution
as raw materials, and then spin-coating of nanofiber mats with PMMA
solution. The obtained nanofiber mats with tailorable optical properties
are transparent and show strong green upconversion emission under
980 nm laser excitation. We developed a suitable method for large
scale production to prepare upconversion photoluminescent, low-cost,
flexible, and optically transparent nanofiber mats. This facile strategy
can be readily used to other types of intriguing nanocomposites for
diverse applications.

Results and Discussion
Owing to
the hydrophobicity of the surface of OA-coated UCNPs,
it is difficult to disperse in formic acid solution. The nanoparticles
may precipitate quickly from the nylon 6/formic acid solution, and
thus, the nanoparticles are hardly dispersed into nylon nanofiber
nanocomposites as the matrix with high uniformity during the co-electrospinning
process. Therefore, the modification of nanoparticles to improve their
dispersity in formic acid solution is essential. Water-soluble UCNP-COOH
capped with polyacrylic acid (PAA) as the ligand were prepared by
the solvothermal method and the ligand exchange method.36 The as-prepared UCNP-OA and UCNP-COOH could
be easily dispersed in cyclohexane and ethanol, respectively. The
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the as-prepared UCNP-OA
and UCNP-COOH samples are shown in Figure 1. The TEM images showed that the as prepared
UCNP-OA and UCNP-COOH nanoparticles are all spherical and their average
sizes are 10.4 ± 1.5 and 10.5 ± 1.3 nm, respectively. The
size distribution of these nanoparticles is shown in Figure S1. The nanoparticles dispersed in the solvent can
emit strong green light under 980 nm laser excitation [Figure 1a (inset) and Figure 1b (inset)].

(a) and UCNP-COOH (b) samples. The digital
photographs of UCNP-OA (a) and UCNP-COOH (b) samples under 980 nm
laser excitation as the inset.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the crystalline
phase structures of nanoparticles, and diffraction patterns are illustrated
in Figure S2 (UCNP-OA and UCNP-COOH and
the standard pattern for hexagonal β-NaYF4). Strong
diffraction peaks can be clearly observed in XRD patterns, and these
peaks are characteristic of β-NaYF4 (JCPDS: 16-0334)
with almost 100% crystallinity. In addition, there are no other peaks
existed in the patterns, which illustrate that a pure crystalline
phase of β-NaYF4 was synthesized via the solvothermal
method and the ligand exchange method.37

The successful preparation of UCNP-COOH samples by the ligand
exchange
method was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra
(Figure S3). According to Figure S3, the existence of PAA capping ligand after the ligand
exchange process was confirmed by the disappearance of alkene stretchings
(=C–H) at 3007 cm–1, which corresponded
to OA. Furthermore, a band at 1564 cm–1 appeared
in the spectrum of the UCNP-OA (Figure S3a) associated with the asymmetric (Vas) stretching vibrations of the carboxylic group of the OA. After
the ligand exchange process, bands corresponding to the carboxylic
group are observed at 1640 cm–1.36

The corresponding upconversion spectra of the UCNP-OA
and UCNP-COOH
samples are shown in Figure S4. The upconversion
spectra of the UCNP-OA and UCNP-COOH samples were the same with the
previously reported spectra of the UCNPs. The spectra of UCNP-OA and
UCNP-COOH both feature three different Er3+ emission bands.
The green emission is associated with the transitions 2H11/2–4I15/2 (521 nm) and 4S3/2–4I15/2 (539 nm)
and red emission is associated with the transitions 4F9/2–4I15/2 (654 nm) for the Er3+ ions.38

The nanofiber mats
were prepared by co-electrospinning and then
spin-coating of nanofiber mats with PMMA solution; the process is
shown in Scheme 1.
The morphologies of the as-prepared electrospinning PA6 nanofiber
mats and UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats were characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and the results are shown in Figure 2. Electrospun UCNP-COOH/PA6
nanofiber mats were uniform and smooth with no beads on the surface
of the nanofiber. When the weight fraction of nanoparticles increased
to 2 wt %, few beads appeared. The morphology was not changed seriously
with the weight fraction of UCNP-COOH increasing as shown in Figure 2a–d. According
to SEM images, the UCNP-COOH/PA6 nanofiber (Figure 2a–d) showed a range of diameters ranging
from 100 to 250 nm. The diameter distributions of these nanofibers
are shown in Figure S5. The thin coating
layer of PMMA can be observed on the surface of functional nanofiber
mats after spin-coating of PMMA solution onto the surface of nanofiber
mats as shown in Figure 2e–h. The coating layer of PMMA was so thin that we can see
the nanofiber on the surface of the mats.

nanofiber mats with different nanomaterial
contents prepared by the co-electrospinning method [(a–d) are
0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt %, respectively]; the transparent UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA
nanofiber mats fabricated by a combination of the co-electrospinning
method and the spin-coating process are shown in (e–h), respectively,
with the nanoparticle content of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt %, respectively.

Scheme 1 Preparation of Transparent Upconversion
Photoluminescent UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA
Nanofiber Mats
Another important
feature of the nanofiber mats was the transparency
against visible light. The transparency of all the nanofiber mats
samples were measured through UV–Vis spectra as presented in Figure 3. According to the
spectra, the UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats exhibited transparency
in the range of 79–86% in the visible wavelength range from
380 to 760 nm. The transparency of the nanofiber mats was found to
be reduced, when the content of UCNP-COOH increased in the mats.

Figure 3 Transmittance
spectra of UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA with the nanoparticles
content of 0.5 (a), 1 (b), 1.5 (c), and 2 wt % (d), respectively.

The results were supported by
digital images illustrated in Figure 4 for UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA
nanofiber mats with different nanoparticle contents, respectively. Figure 4a–h shows
digital images of UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats under visible
light and 980 nm laser irradiation, with nanoparticle contents of
0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt %, respectively. PMMA-coated UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA
nanocomposite fiber mats emitted green color when they were placed
under 980 nm laser irradiation. From these images, we can clearly
see the text under the nanofiber mats, and this indicates that the
nanofiber mats have a high degree of transparency. According to the
previous reported work, the transparency of the nanofibers and polymer
nanocomposites relies on the diameter of nanofibers and the refractive
index difference between the nanofibers and the polymers matrix.24 The nanofiber mats have a high degree of transparency,
and this is because the refractive index between PA6 nanofiber and
PMMA polymer matrix was similar. The diameter of the UCNP-COOH/PA6
nanofibers is in the range of 100–250 nm, and so, the PA6 nanofibers
were thin enough for light transmission.18

Figure 4 Digital
photographs of UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats under
visible light (a–d) and 980 nm laser irradiation (e–h)
with nanomaterial contents of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt %, respectively.

Upconversion fluorescence spectra
of UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber
mats are shown in Figure 5. The spectra of UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats are similar
to the corresponding UCNPs, which means that they have the same kind
of emission centers. For UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats, the red
emission is associated with the transitions 4F9/2–4I15/2 (654 nm) and the green emission
is associated with the transitions 4S3/2–4I15/2 (539 nm) and 2H11/2–4I15/2 (521 nm) for the Er3+ ions.37,38 According to Figure 5, with the weight fraction of UCNP-COOH increasing,
the upconversion photoluminescent intensity of the UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA
nanofiber mats increased gradually. These results showed that the
UCNPs-COOH were successfully incorporated into PA6 nanofibers and
the properties of the filler nanoparticles are well preserved.39 We also compared the upconversion fluorescence
spectra of UCNP-COOH/PA6 with UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats (Figure S6) with the same loading of nanoparticles
of 2 wt %. The spectra of UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats are similar
to the UCNP-COOH/PA6 nanofiber mats, which means that they have the
same kind of emission centers. However, the upconversion photoluminescent
intensity was decreased slightly, which is because the PMMA polymer
matrix has negative effects on the upconversion photoluminescent of
the nanofiber.

mats under 980 nm laser irradiation, with nanoparticle contents of
0.5 (a), 1 (b), 1.5 (c), and 2 wt % (d), respectively.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed
a viable strategy based on co-electrospinning
and spin-coating methods for the fabrication of the transparent and
upconversion photoluminescent nanofiber mats with tunable upconversion
luminescent intensity. PA6 nanofiber mats were decorated by UCNP-COOH
and PMMA to introduce upconversion photoluminescent properties and
transparency into the nanofiber mats, respectively. The UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA
nanofiber mats exhibited green upconversion luminescent and transparent
properties. The upconversion luminescent intensity of the functional
nanofiber mats can be tailored by adjusting the weight fraction of
UCNP-COOH as fillers. This facile strategy can be readily used to
other types of intriguing nanocomposites for diverse applications.
As such, by minimizing the enthalpic interaction between functional
nanoparticles and polymer matrix, functional polymer-based nanofiber
composites can be readily crafted by the co-electrospinning method,
thereby facilitating the fundamental investigation of their structure–property
relationships. The transparent and upconversion photoluminescent nanofiber
mats with tunable upconversion luminescent intensity may find diverse
potential applications, such as optical devices, sensors and so on.

Characterization
JEOL TEM 100CX high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy was conducted to characterize UCNP-OA and UCNP-COOH.
Samples of the UCNP-OA and UCNP-COOH for TEM characterization were
fabricated by drop-coating dilute dispersions onto the copper grid,
respectively. SEM micrographs were measured on a field emission scanning
electron microscope (JSM7500F). XRD patterns were conducted on a Y2000
X-ray diffractometer by using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA).
FT-IR spectra were collected by using a Nicolet 460 spectrometer.
Upconversion fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh FS5
fluorescence spectrometer excited by 980 nm laser (0–2500 mW,

fiber mats was measured on a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(Varian, USA).

Preparation of OA-Capped NaYF4: 20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ Nanoparticles (UCNP-OA)
Sphere-like
UCNP-OA was prepared by a typical method.36 YCl3 (152.3 mg, 0.78 mmol), YbCl3 (55.9 mg,
0.2 mmol), and ErCl3 (5.5 mg, 0.02 mmol) were dissolved
in 10 mL of methanol in a flask, and then, 15 mL of OA and 35 mL of
ODE were added and kept at 160 °C for 30 min and then cooled
down to 50 °C. NH4F (0.2964 g) and NaOH (0.2 g) were
dissolved in 25 mL of methanol and then was added to the solution
and degassed at 110 °C and then kept at 300 °C for 1 h.
After cooling to room temperature, UCNP-OA was precipitated out and
washed three times with ethanol and cyclohexane. Finally, UCNP-OA
were dispersed in cyclohexane.

Preparation of Hydrophilic
NaYF4: 20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ Nanoparticles
(UCNP-COOH)
The ligand
exchange process was applied by using a previously reported experimental
procedure but modified as follows: DEG (10 mL) and PAA (0.5 g) were
added into a flask and then heated to 110 °C under N2. Subsequently, 2 mL of toluene containing 30 mg of UCNP-OA was added
into the solution at 110 °C, then heated to 240 °C, and
kept for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, UCNP-COOH were washed
three times with ethanol.

Preparation of UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA Nanofiber
Mats by the Combination
of the Co-electrospinning Method and the Spin-Coating Process
The co-electrospinning method and spin-coating process were used
to prepare UCNP-COOH/PA6/PMMA nanofiber mats. UCNP-COOH were prepared
by using the previously reported experimental procedure, and the details
are shown in Supporting Information.38,39 First, PA6 (1.5 g) and UCNP-COOH (15 mg) were dissolved in 5 mL
of formic acid to form the mixture solution before the electrospinning
process. The voltage used was 30 kV, and the distance between the
polymer solution and the collection screen (tin foil) was 16 cm. The
feeding rate was kept at 1 mL/h. The co-electrospinning method was
performed for 6 h with the relative humidity of 75%. The nanofiber
mats were dried in vacuum for 24 h. The spin-coating method was used
to combine PA6 nanofiber mats with PMMA thin layers. Pieces of PA6
nanofiber mats were cut and the mats were laid on the glass, followed
by dripping anhydrous ethanol evenly on the mats and then spinning
at 1000 rpm for 0.5 min; this procedure was repeated until the mats
have no wrinkle. Then, 10 wt % PMMA chloroform solution was dripped
evenly on the mats, followed by spinning at 1000 rpm for 1 min; then,
the mats were immersed in water, and the membranes were removed with
a pair of tweezers. The samples were dried in vacuum at 45 °C
for 1 h.
