The present work explores the structural,
microstructural, optical,
magnetic, and hyperfine properties of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres, which have been synthesized
by a novel template-free solvothermal method. Powder X-ray diffraction,
electron microscopic, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic
techniques were employed to thoroughly investigate the structural
and microstructural properties of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres. The results revealed that
the microspheres (average diameter ∼121 nm) have been formed
by self-assembly of nanoparticles with an average particle size of
∼12 nm. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic and
photoluminescence studies have been performed to study the optical
properties of the sample. The studies indicate that Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres exhibit
a lower band gap value and enhanced PL intensity compared to their
nanoparticle counterpart. The outcomes of dc magnetic measurement
and Mössbauer spectroscopic study confirm that the sample is
ferrimagnetic in nature. The values of saturation magnetization are
76 and 116 emu g–1 at 300 and 5 K, respectively,
which are substantially larger than its nanosized counterpart. The
infield Mössbauer spectroscopic study and Rietveld analysis
of the PXRD pattern reveal that Fe3+ ions have migrated
from [B] to (A) sites resulting in the cation distribution: (Zn2+0.46Fe3+0.54)A[Zn2+0.24Co2+0.3Fe3+1.46]BO4. Comparison of
electrochemical performance of the Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres to that of the Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles reveals
that the former displays greater specific capacitance (149.13 F g–1) than the latter (80.06 F g–1)
due to its self-assembled porous structure. Moreover, it was found
that Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres
possess a better electrochemical response toward H2O2 sensing than Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles in a wide linear range.

Introduction
Over the past few years,
superparamagnetic ferrite nanoparticles
have drawn considerable attention because of the fundamental physics
involved and their potential technological application in drug delivery,
magnetic resonance imaging, medical diagnosis, ferrofluids, catalysis,
water and air purification, photocatalytic degradation of toxic compounds,
gas separation, and magnetic fluid hyperthermia treatment of cancer.1−7 If the size of a magnetic substance is reduced below a certain size
limit, the thermal energy (kBT, where kB and T are
Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively) becomes comparable
to the magnetic anisotropy energy (KV, where K and V are the anisotropy energy constant
and volume of the particle, respectively) responsible for clutching
the magnetization along a certain orientation, and in consequence,
the magnetic moment flips randomly with time causing the particles
to become superparamagnetic (SPM).8−10 Usually, ultrafine magnetic
nanoparticles exhibit SPM behavior above their so-called blocking
temperature (TB).8−12 The SPM nanoparticles possess moderate saturation
magnetization, can be easily dispersed in a liquid medium, and respond
to the change in external magnetic fields.11,13−16 Agglomeration resulting from strong magnetic interaction does not
take place in SPM nanoparticles as interparticle interaction is very
feeble for this system. These features of SPM nanoparticles make them
suitable for different biomedical applications. On the other hand,
the reduction of magnetization due to the finite size effect and spin
canting is a common feature of SPM nanoparticles.17−19 SPM nanoparticles
cannot be efficiently manipulated using a moderate magnetic field
because of their low magnetization, and this limits their applications
severely.11,13 The magnetization usually increases with
the increase of particle size. However, simply making particles larger
cannot be a solution for overcoming the conflict between the requirement
of high magnetization and the inherent character of the SPM nanoparticles
since, with the increase of size, the particles lose their SPM character
and become magnetically ordered resulting in strong aggregation, and
thus, those particles do not remain rapidly dispersible in solution.11,13,15 Efforts have been made to prepare
submicron-sized SPM ferrites
with high saturation magnetization through composite formation or
by embedding the nanometric SPM particles in the polymer and silica
matrix.14,20−24 However, uniform loading of the magnetic nanoparticles
in these systems is very difficult as ferrites do not disperse evenly
during the growth process of such synthesis techniques. An alternative
strategy of forming hierarchical self-assembled and monodispersed
microspheres of ferrite composed of SPM particles appears to be more
attractive because of the possibility of enhancing the magnetization
while retaining the SPM characteristic. Recently, we have performed
a detailed study on structural, microstructural, magnetic, and hyperfine
properties of the SPM Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticle system.25 In
this background, it will be interesting to examine whether the submicron-sized
self-assembled spheres composed of SPM Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles can show enhancement of
saturation magnetization compared to their nanosized counterpart while
retaining the SPM character of their constituent nanoparticles. Further,
we have chosen Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles as the building blocks of self-assembled hierarchical
ferrite microspheres as it will help us to study as well as compare
the structural, magnetic, optical, hyperfine, and electrochemical
properties of both Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles and microspheres.

It may be noted that
supercapacitors are considered as among the
most promising next-generation energy storage devices due to their
high power density, fast rate of charging–discharging, excellent
reversibility, stable life cycle, and safe mode of operation compared
to other electrochemical energy storage devices.26−32 Supercapacitors are generally classified into two categories based
on their fundamental energy storage mechanism.27 The first one is the electrochemical double layer capacitor
(EDLC) where the energy is stored by the electrostatic accumulation
of charges, and the other type is the pseudocapacitor, which stores
electrical energy by a fast and reversible faradaic redox reaction.27,28 Even though EDLCs provide high power density and excellent life
cycle, they can store a limited amount of energy due to finite electrical
charge separation at the interface of electrode and electrolytes.27,28 In this context, it is relevant to mention that the pseudocapacitors
have higher specific capacitance and energy density than EDLCs, which
can be beneficially used in fabrication of high-quality energy storage
devices.27,28 RuO2 is a distinctive example
of a pseudocapacitor with high pseudocapacitance, high reliability,
and excellent reversibility.27,32 Recently, attempts
have been made to explore the pseudocapacitive properties of some
other transition-metal oxides like Fe2O3, V2O5, NiO, MnO2, and Mn2O3 as an alternative to RuO2 since it is very much
costly.33−38 However, most of these materials suffer from low capacitance and
poor cycling stability, which produces insurmountable obstruction
to design a practical energy storage device.27 A possible way out to overcome these disadvantages is to develop
nanostructured oxide materials as they exhibit higher capacitive performance
due to their high surface area and short ion transfer pathway.27 However, these oxide nanomaterials have been
found to be of little convenient use because of their poor intrinsic
conductivity and unstable life cycle.27 In this background, recently, some research groups have proposed
MFe2O4 (where M is a divalent metal ion)-type
spinel ferrite heterostructures as very good candidates for electrochemical
energy storage application as they exhibit better electrical conductivity,
rich redox chemistry, and higher electrochemical activity than oxides
containing one type of metal atom.27 There
are several reports available regarding the synthesis and electrochemical
performance of ZnFe2O4, Fe3O4, CuFe2O4, CoFe2O4, MnFe2O4, and other ferrite-based self-assembled
heterostructures.27,39−44 In this work, we have presented a comparative study on the electrochemical
properties and pseudocapacitive behavior of self-assembled Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres
and Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles.

Besides the issues related to magnetic and electrochemical properties,
iron-based biocompatible, nontoxic, chemically stable, and low-cost
oxide materials have been successfully used in electrochemical sensing
of gas, humidity, ethanol, H2O2, hydrazine,
and DNA.45−49 Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an efficient liquid
oxidant and is widely used in the biomedical, biopharmaceutical, environmental,
clinical, and industrial fields.48,50 It is one
of the most common reactive oxygen species and when in contact with
a living organism without proper precaution can damage cellular proteins,
nucleic acids, and lipid molecules and thereby may cause diabetes,
cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders.50,51 Hence, sensitive and precise detection of H2O2 is of prime challenge in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biomedical
research fields. Until now, many techniques like calorimetry, electrochemistry,
chemiluminescence, and fluorescence have been proposed to detect H2O2 qualitatively and quantitatively.50 Among all the proposed methods, nonenzymatic
amperometric sensing has attracted prime attention because this method
is very simple, sensitive, and does not require high-cost complex
instrumentation.48,50 As a result, a great deal of
effort has been paid for fabrication of nonprecious electrochemical
probes for rapid and sensitive detection of H2O2.

Nanostructured spinel ferrites have appeared as potential
candidates
for electrochemical probing of H2O2 due to their
large surface area, excellent catalytic activity, and cost-effective
synthesis process.15,52 It has been reported that the
substitution of iron ions of the spinel ferrite system by Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ ions leads
to the improvement of the physicochemical and electrical conductivity
of the system due to the formation of new donor–acceptor chemisorption
sites and fast electron transfer mechanism between the cations.52 Recently, a comparative study has revealed that
the order of reactivity of electrospun MFe2O4 nanofibers toward peroxide determination/reduction is as follows:
CoFe2O4 > CuFe2O4 >
NiFe2O4 > MnFe2O4 >
Fe2O3 systems.53 Highly porous,
hierarchical morphology of mixed ferrites promotes fast mass transfer
kinetics across their channels besides increasing the density as well
as reactivity of exposed electrocatalytic active sites.54,55 The above explorations reveal that further improved and prominent
electrochemical behavior would be expected in porous microsphere morphology
compared to densely packed mixed-ferrite nanoparticles. The observation
that self-assembled ferrite microstructures often exhibit striking
electrical, optical, magnetic, and catalytic properties compared to
their nanoparticle counterparts,52 thus,
has inspired us to investigate the performance of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 self-assembled microspheres
as nonenzymatic H2O2 sensors.

It is well
known that nanoparticles, self-assembled heterostructures
of nanoparticles, and core–shell nano/microstructures exhibit
outstanding optical properties like linear absorption, photoluminescence
emission, and nonlinear optical properties. In this context, the study
of optical properties of different hierarchically developed nano/microstructures
will surely help to probe their potential toward different optoelectronic
and sensor devices and photocatalytic degradation of toxic dyes.40,56−59 Spinel ferrites generally exhibit lower band gap values, which are
very crucial in their optical applications.60,61 In this context, it would be worthy to study the optical properties
of the Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres and nanoparticles to gather more information on their
band gap values.

In this work, self-assembled microspheres of
Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 have been
successfully synthesized
by a facile, one-pot, low-temperature, low-cost solvothermal method.
We have thoroughly characterized the sample by powder X-ray diffraction,
field-emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, photoluminescence,
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and
dc magnetic measurement. We have performed a detailed study on electrochemical
properties of the sample and its nanosized counterpart to compare
the pseudocapacitive electrical storage capacity and sensing capability
of these samples toward detection of H2O2.

Experimental
Methods
Synthesis Procedure of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 Microspheres (CZMS)
Analytical-grade
transition-metal chlorides CoCl2·6H2O,
ZnCl2·4H2O, and FeCl3·6H2O of extremely high purity (∼99.99%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Sodium acetate
(NaAc, CH3COONa·3H2O), ethylene glycol
(EG, HOCH2CH2OH), and polyethylene glycol (PEG,
MW = 4000) of analytical purity were procured from Merck India.

Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres
(CZMS) were synthesized by a simple, template-free, low-temperature,
one-pot solvothermal method. At first, 10 mM FeCl3·6H2O, 1.5 mM CoCl2·6H2O, and 3.5 mM
ZnSO4·6H2O were dissolved in 80 mL of EG
through vigorous magnetic stirring. Afterward, 7.2 g of NaAc along
with 2 g of surfactant PEG was added to the salt solution, and the
mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 2 h to obtain
a homogeneous brown solution. Then the solution was transferred into
a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180
°C for 20 h in an oven. The autoclave was cooled down to room
temperature naturally and taken out from the oven. After that, the
precipitate was collected and washed several times with deionized
water and ethanol by centrifugation to remove organic and inorganic
residues. Finally, the precipitate was dried in vacuum at 65 °C
for 8 h to obtain a black fine powder of CZMS.

Characterization Techniques
We have recorded the powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of CZMS at 21 °C over the 2θ
range of 10–80° using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer
with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54184 Å) radiation. The PXRD data
was collected with a step size and counting time of 0.0199° and
3 s/step, respectively. The surface morphology of the sample was probed
by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI INSPECT
F50). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
was performed by using a JEOL JEM 2100 instrument to determine particle
size distribution. The crystalline character of the sample was further
investigated by recording the selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern using a JEOL JEM 2100 instrument. The presence of constituent
elements in CZMS was checked by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS). The EDS spectrum of the sample was recorded by a Bruker EDS
system attached with HRTEM equipment. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
was performed by using a PerkinElmer spectrometer (Spectrum Two) equipped
with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) attachment. The diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra of the samples were recorded
by a PerkinElmer UV–vis spectrometer (Lambda 35) with a solid-state
measurement attachment. The UV–vis and photoluminescence (PL)
spectra of the samples were recorded by JASCO V-630 and JASCO FP-6700
spectrophotometers, respectively.

The magnetic property of CZMS
was investigated by a Cryogenic vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM).
The standard zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetization
protocol measurement was performed at an external magnetic field of
500 Oe in the temperature range of 5–300 K. The isothermal
variation of magnetization (M) with the change of
the external magnetic field (H) was recorded at 300
and 5 K in the field range of ±5 T.

The 57Fe
Mössbauer spectroscopic measurement
of the sample was carried out in transmission mode at 300 and 10 K.
The 300 K Mössbauer spectrum was recorded by using a constant
acceleration drive (CMTE-250) equipped with a 10 mCi 57Co source embedded in the Rh matrix. The 10 K Mössbauer spectrum
was recorded with the help of a JANIS SVT-400 MOSS cryostat system.
The Mössbauer spectrum at 10 K in the presence of a 5 T external
field applied parallel to the γ-ray direction was recorded by
a superconducting magnet (JANIS SuperOptiMag) with a 40 mCi 57Co source. The velocity calibration was performed by using a natural
iron foil, and the values of isomer shifts were estimated with reference
to standard α-Fe at 300 K. Windows-based Recoil software was
used for the qualitative analysis of the Mössbauer spectra.62

Fabrication of Working Electrode and Electrochemical
Characterization
The working electrode was fabricated by
adopting the following
procedure. At first, a graphitic-carbon rod with a working electrode
area of 0.13 cm2 was washed thoroughly in distilled water
by ultrasonication. Then the washed rod was wrapped by a Teflon sheet
keeping both ends open. The sample was mixed in distilled water and
Nafion (5 wt %) by ultrasonication to form an aqueous solution of
concentration 1.6 mg mL–1. 10 μL of the resulting
solution was dropped on the rounded flat surface of the graphite rod
and dried at ambient temperature overnight.

All electrochemical
measurements for supercapacitive studies and electrochemical sensing
of H2O2 were performed at 25 °C using a
conventional three-electrode system with the drop-coated sample on
the graphitic-carbon rod acting as the working electrode, a saturated
calomel electrode as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the
counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric measurements
were performed in 1 and 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions, respectively,
as electrolytes using a potentiostat instrument (Digi-ivy, model No.
DY2300). The galvanostatic charging–discharging performance
was studied in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution with the same three-electrode
setup using an Autolab PGSTAT30 instrument. All the CV scans for electrochemical
peroxide sensing by its reduction were recorded in the potential range
between −0.2 to −0.6 V at a scan rate of 10 mV/s with
different concentrations of H2O2 (0, 0.058,
1.18, and 1.47 mM) in a 0.1 M aqueous NaOH electrolyte, while chronoamperometric
investigations of H2O2 reduction were carried
out in 0.1 M aqueous NaOH solution with different molar amounts of
H2O2 at potentials of −0.42 and −0.45
V, respectively, for 120 s.

Results and Discussion
Structural,
Microstructural, and Morphological Study
The PXRD pattern
of CZMS is depicted in Figure 1, which reflects that all the characteristic
X-ray diffraction peaks ascribing to the cubic spinel ferrite system
are present in the diffractogram.25 The
indexing of the PXRD pattern was performed by DICVOL06 and TREOR90
of the FullProf 2000 package and NTREOR of the EXPO2009 package adopting
the methodology described in our previous works.12,17−19,63−65 The space group of CZMS was determined by FINDSPACE of the EXPO2009
package, which suggests that the sample crystallizes in the Fd-3m space group.66 The crystallographic information (Miller indices, space group) obtained
from the preliminary analysis of the PXRD data is in excellent agreement
with the JCPDS database of ZnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 systems (JCPDS No. 89-1012 and 22-1086 for ZnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4, respectively).67

The green line indicates the respective residue.

In order to get detailed information regarding the structural
(lattice
parameter, atomic coordinates) and microstructural (crystallite size
and lattice strain) parameters of the sample, we have performed Rietveld
refinement of the PXRD pattern by using the MAUD2.33 software package,
and the method of refinement is described elsewhere.20,68 The fitted PXRD pattern is shown in Figure S1, and the final refinement parameters are listed in Table S1. For a deeper understanding of the crystal structure
and to estimate the bond lengths and bond angles, we have also performed
the Rietveld refinement of the PXRD pattern of CZMS by the GSAS program
with the EXPGUI interface.69,70 The PXRD data along
with the refinement curve is shown in Figure 1, which shows that the experimental and the
simulated data match with acceptable agreement. The refinement parameters,
metal-oxide bond lengths and bond angles, and fractional coordinates
along with occupancies of different ions are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The unit cell of CZMS together with the tetrahedral and octahedral
lattice sites is illustrated in Figure 2. The Rietveld refinement of the PXRD data by MAUD2.33
and GSAS software programs suggests that CZMS is single-phase cubic
spinel ferrite, which crystallizes in the Fd-3m space group.

The FESEM micrograph (Figure 3a) clearly indicates the formation of three-dimensional
hierarchical self-assembled microspheres of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles. The average diameter
of the microsphere is observed to be ∼124 nm (Figure S2). The FESEM micrographs also suggest that the microspheres
are formed by aggregation of a large number of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles, which leads to
an uneven outer surface of the microspheres.

HRTEM images showing (b) size distribution,
(c) single microsphere, and (d) lattice fringes of CZMS.

For the verification of the outcomes obtained by
the PXRD and FESEM
studies and to acquire more knowledge about the structural and microstructural
properties of the sample, we have recorded the HRTEM images of the
sample. The TEM images at high and low magnification along with the
SAED pattern are shown in Figure 3b,c, respectively. The high-resolution TEM study suggests
that the average diameter of the Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microsphere is ∼121 nm. Further assessment
of the HRTEM images indicates that the microspheres consist of self-assembled
Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles
of ∼12 nm size (Figure 3c), which is in good agreement with the value of crystallite
size (∼14 nm) obtained from the Rietveld refinement of the
PXRD data (the slight mismatch in the crystallite size and the particle
size is due to the difficulty in accurately distinguishing the individual
nanoparticles in the microspheres). The good crystallinity of the
sample has been reflected by the presence of clear lattice fringes
in the HRTEM micrograph (Figure 3d) and bright Debye–Scherrer ring in the selected
area diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure S3). The crystallographic d values obtained from the
radius of the rings corresponding to different lattice spacings of
the SAED pattern corroborate with those acquired from the PXRD study.
The distinct peaks originating from the constituent elements (Co,
Zn, Fe, and O) were clearly observed in the EDS spectra of both CZMS
(Figure S4) and CZNP (Figure S5). The ratios of atomic percentages of Co, Zn, and
Fe in CZMS and CZNP obtained from the EDS spectrum are 0.92:2.23:5.37
and 5.24:11.95:33.66, respectively, which confirm that the samples
are in proper stoichiometry.

The morphology (shape and size),
phase, and degree of purity of
nanostructured materials synthesized by sol–gel,71,72 sonochemical,73−75 thermal decomposition,76,77 hydrothermal,78,79 and Schiff base ligand mediated methods80 can be controlled by properly tuning the reaction parameters like
reaction temperature, pressure, pH, time, reactant concentration,
and choice of the precursor and surfactant.59,71−80 Among all these synthesis techniques, the hydrothermal method is
the most favorable procedure for developing hierarchical self-assembled
heterostructures due to its capability of inducing preferred orientational
morphological growth.78,79,81,82 Further, the solvothermal/hydrothermal technique
is a facile, energy-efficient, low-cost, and green synthesis technique.78,79,81−86 It is relevant to mention that, in the solvothermal reaction technique,
only the variation of the reaction temperature by constraining other
reaction parameters (concentration of the reactants, choice of the
solvent, presence of the surfactant, pH of the reaction medium, reaction
time, etc.) may lead to the formation of different kinds of morphological
forms of self-assembled heterostructures.83−87 By performing PXRD, SEM, and TEM studies on the MFe2O4 (M = Mn, Co, Ni) microspheres with average diameters
of 100–300 nm synthesized by the solvothermal technique at
different temperatures, Reddy and Mohamed have shown that the optimal
temperature for synthesizing such ferrite microspheres with good crystallinity
and narrow size distribution is 180 °C.87 So, to fulfill the target of synthesizing monodispersed, highly
crystalline microspheres, we have chosen the solvothermal method as
the synthesis technique and 180 °C as the reaction temperature.
From the structural and microstructural characterization of CZMS,
it is clear that this target has been achieved.

FTIR Study
The FTIR spectra of CZMS and CZNP recorded
in the wavenumber range of 400 to 2000 cm–1 are
displayed in Figure 4 and Figure S6, respectively. In the FTIR
spectrum of ferrites, two broad bands appear at ∼590 and 405
cm–1 due to the stretching vibration of (A) and
[B] site metal–oxygen (M–O) bonds, respectively.88 Both CZMS and CZNP displays absorption bands,
each at 580 and 417 cm–1 and 541 and 450 cm–1, respectively, in their respective FTIR spectrum.
This indicates that both samples are cubic spinel ferrites.

Study of Optical Properties
The optical properties
of the samples have been investigated by UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopic (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) studies to determine
the band gaps of the samples. It is well known that the band gap is
dependent on various factors like crystallite size, dopant concentration,
and structural parameters.56,60,61,89−91 The DRS spectra
of CZMS and CZNP are shown in Figure 5a. It can be ascertained from the DRS spectrum of CZMS
that it displays an absorption edge at around 775 nm. On the other
hand, CZNP exhibits a broad absorption band with no such detectable
absorption edge, and thus, it is not possible to calculate the band
gap value of CZNP from this absorption band. Hence, the band gaps
of the samples have been estimated from the intercept of the (αhν)2 versus hν plot
(Kubelka–Munk plot), where α is the absorption coefficient.60 The Kubelka–Munk plots for CZMS and CZNP
are presented in Figure 5b. The estimated band gaps of CZMS and CZNP are 1.6 and 2.45 eV,
respectively. The band gap of pure ZnFe2O4 is
2.1 eV, and it generally decreases with the increase in cobalt doping
concentration.60,61 In the present case, CZMS follows
this trend, but there is an increase in the band gap of CZNP, which
may be attributed to the quantum confinement effect related to the
small size of the nanoparticles.61

Figure 5 (a) DRS spectra
and (b) (αhν)2 versus hν plots of CZMS and CZNP.

The UV–vis spectra of both CZMS and CZNP (Figure S7) exhibit a broad absorption band around
∼420
nm. Thus, both samples have been excited at a frequency of ∼420
nm to record the PL spectra of CZMS and CZNP (Figure 6). CZMS and CZNP display emission peaks at
∼632 and 630 nm. The intensity of the PL peak of CZNP is lower
than that of CZMS. It may be noted that CZMS has been prepared by
the surfactant-assisted solvothermal technique. These surfactants
generally reduce surface defects and decrease the number of trap sites
in the system.40 So, in such a system,
a majority of electrons relax through direct transitions between conduction
and valence bands. On the other hand, CZNP was synthesized by the
high-energy ball milling method, which introduces lattice strain,
causes contraction of lattice parameter, and gives rise to defects
and vacancies in the system. All these together can initiate indirect
transitions in the system, thus reducing the PL intensity.

spectra of CZMS and CZNP.

The particle size and morphological features of a sample
strongly
influences its band gap energy, which is further important in determining
its electrochemical activity.92 So, it
is expected that the electrochemical performances of CZMS and CZNP
will be different, which has indeed been observed in the electrochemical
study.

Mössbauer Spectroscopic Study
57Fe
Mössbauer spectroscopy is a widely used tool for verifying
the magnetic ordering, cation distribution, and spin-canting effect
of iron-containing oxide materials.17,93,94 The room-temperature Mössbauer spectrum (Figure 7a) of CZMS was fitted
by the “Lorentzian site analysis” method of the Recoil
program, and the fitted parameters are listed in Table 3. The spectrum exhibits a diffused
sextet resulting from the collective behavior of magnetic nanoparticles
assembled in the form of microspheres. We have fitted the room-temperature
Mössbauer spectrum with two hyperfine split sextets. The values
of the isomer shift (IS) suggest that only the high-spin Fe3+ ions are present in the sample and no signature of the Fe2+ ion was detected.17 Thus, the room-temperature
Mössbauer spectroscopic study indicates that CZMS is in the
magnetically ordered state at room temperature. It is noteworthy that
CZMS has been formed by the aggregation of large numbers of individual
nanoparticles and the aggregation process has masked the SPM relaxation
in the system as the individual anisotropy energy barrier is modified
due to the onset of strong interparticle interactions. As a distinct
anisotropy energy barrier cannot be defined for an individual particle,
CZMS displays the collective magnetic state, which gives rise to a
diffused sextet in its room-temperature Mössbauer spectrum.18,95

For quantitative estimation of the
relative distribution of Fe3+ ions among tetrahedral (A)
and octahedral [B] sites and
to probe the spin-canting effect in CZMS, we have recorded the Mössbauer
spectrum of the sample at 5 K in the presence of a 5 T external magnetic
field. The infield Mössbauer spectrum exhibits two clearly
resolved subspectra, which suggest that CZMS is ferrimagnetically
ordered at 5 K. We have fitted the infield spectrum using the Lorentzian
site analysis method of the Recoil program by taking a pair of sextet
assigned to the (A) and [B] site iron ions. The fitted spectrum is
shown in Figure 7c,
and the hyperfine parameters are listed in Table 4. The non-vanishing intensities of the 2nd
and 5th lines of the six-finger pattern suggest the presence of spin
canting in the sample.17 The average values
of (A) and [B] site canting angles (1.07 and 18.41° for (A) and
[B] site moments, respectively) have been estimated by taking into
account the ratio of the line intensities of the 2nd and 3rd lines
of the sextets ascribed to the (A) and [B] sites, respectively, using
the standard formula.17,93 The relative ratio of Fe3+ ions among (A) and [B] sites (Fe3+A/Fe3+B) has been determined from the areal
intensity of the sextets corresponding to the (A) and [B] sites. For
the infield spectrum, the value of Fe3+A/Fe3+B was found to be 0.37. Hence, it is clear from
the outcome of the infield Mössbauer study that Fe3+ ions have migrated from [B] to (A) sites. By keeping in mind that
Co2+ has a strong tendency to occupy the [B] site due to
its favorable atomic radius and charge distribution in the octahedral
crystal field, we have estimated the structural formula of the CZMS
to be (Zn2+0.46Fe3+0.54)A[Zn2+0.24Co2+0.3Fe3+1.46]BO4, which is
different from the equilibrium cation configuration (Zn2+0.7Fe3+0.3)A[Co2+0.3Fe3+1.7]BO4. The structural formula obtained from the infield Mössbauer
spectrum corroborates with the one obtained from Rietveld refinement
of the PXRD pattern of the sample. We have also fitted the 5 K without
field Mössbauer spectrum by constraining the values of the
Fe3+A/Fe3+B ratio as obtained
from the fitting of the infield pattern. It is evident that the 5
K without field spectrum (Figure 7b) has been well fitted with the experimental data
and the fitted values of the hyperfine parameters (Table 4) corroborate with those obtained
from the fitting of the 5 K infield spectrum. This validates the observations
of the infield study. Thus, the Mössbauer study indicates that
CZMS is ferrimagnetically ordered at low temperature; there is substantial
migration of iron ions from [B] to (A) site, and the surface spins
are canted.

dc Magnetic
Study
The ZFC-FC magnetization measurement
as a function of temperature is a very useful tool to study the particle
size distribution, magnetic anisotropy energy, and magnetic ordering
of iron-based oxide nanoparticles.19,96 The ZFC-FC
magnetization curves in the temperature range between 5 and 300 K
and at a 500 Oe external magnetic field are shown in Figure 8a. The FC magnetization remains
almost constant throughout the measurement temperature range, and
the ZFC magnetization falls sharply below 300 K. From the Mössbauer
spectroscopic study, it has been observed that the sample exhibits
a prominent sextet at and below 300 K. Thus, the fall in ZFC magnetization
below 300 K can be ascribed to the spin-glass-like freezing of the
magnetically coupled spins in the sample.8

magnetization are represented by pink and green lines, respectively.
(b) M–H (hysteresis) loop

respectively, are shown in the inset for clarity.

The isothermal variations of magnetization (M)
as a function of the external magnetic field (H) at 300 and 5 K in
the field range of ±5 T are shown in Figure 8b. The saturation magnetizations (MSAT) of the sample have been calculated from
the M versus 1/H plot using the
law of approach to saturation.17 The values
of MSAT at 300 and 5 K are 76 and 116
emu g–1, respectively, which are considerably higher
than that of the Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles reported in our previous work.25 The values of coercivity (HC) at 300 and 5 K are 99 and 1826 Oe, respectively. We have also determined
the values of anisotropy constant (K) by fitting
the M–H curve using the modified
Langevin function with the help of MATLAB software.97−99 The value of
anisotropy constant of the sample determined from the fitting of the
virgin curve of the M–H loop
(Figure S8) is 10.63 × 106 J m–3 at 5 K.

Electrochemical Performance
To study the electrochemical
properties of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microspheres (CZMS) and nanoparticles (CZNP), we have prepared
the electrodes coated with CZMS and CZNP using 1 M NaOH aqueous solution
as the electrolyte and performed the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic
charging–discharging (GCD) measurements. The cyclic voltammograms
of CZMS and CZNP electrodes at scan rates of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV
s–1 in the potential range of ±0.4 V with reference
to the saturated calomel electrode are illustrated in Figure 9a,b. From the cyclic voltammograms
of CZMS and CZNP, it is clear that they do not exhibit ideal rectangular
current–potential voltammograms of the electrical double layer
capacitor.100,101 Moreover, no redox peaks have
been observed in the cathodic or anodic cycles of the CV curves of
CZMS and CZNP. The deviation from the rectangular shape of the CV
curves can be ascribed to the pseudocapacitive behavior of CZMS and
CZNP originated from the transfer of charges between electrode and
electrolyte.102 The charge transfer mechanism
can be accomplished by oxidation–reduction reaction, electrosorption,
and intercalation processes.103 In the
case of CZMS and CZNP, the pseudocapacitance has been instigated due
to charge transfer between the electrodes and the electrolyte through
electrosorption and intercalation processes, which can be understood
from the following reaction  

Figure 9 CV
plots showing current density versus voltage at different scan
rates for (a) CZMS and (b) CZNP.

The previous characterization studies inform that iron is
present
in the +3 oxidation state while cobalt and zinc are present in the
+2 oxidation state. The above equation thus indicates that the pseudocapacitive
behavior of this material takes place through interconversion of Co2+/Co3+ states coupled with simultaneous insertion/deintercalation
of OH– ions during the charging–discharging
process.

The values of specific capacitance (CS) of the working electrodes containing CZMS and CZNP
were calculated
from CV graphs taken at scan rates of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s–1 using the equation: CS = , where m is the mass of
the active electrode material, v is the potential
sweep rate, and i is the current response that can
be obtained by integrating the area of the curve , where Va and Vc represent the anodic and
cathodic voltages,
respectively.104,105 The values of specific capacitance
at scan rates of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s–1 are
149.13, 97.47, 57.76, and 44.78 F g–1, respectively,
for CZMS and 80.06, 58.16, 36.85, and 24.97 F g–1, respectively, for CZNP. It has been observed that the specific
capacitance of CZMS is much higher than that of CZNP at all scan rates,
and for both samples, the values of specific capacitance decrease
with the increase in the scan rate. At higher scan rates, ions get
attached to the atoms of the electrode and thereby increase the ionic
resistance. The increase of effective ionic resistance promotes obstruction
in the charge transfer process, which leads to the drop of capacitance
with the increase of the scan rate.106 Moreover,
the area of the CV curves increases with the sweep rate, keeping the
shape of the curves unaltered, which also reflects the good electrochemical
response of the samples.39

Galvanostatic
charging–discharging (GCD) is another tool
to characterize the capacitive performance of the electrode materials.
The specific capacitances of CZMS and CZNP can be evaluated from the
GCD curve according to the equation  , where I is the current
density, Δt and m denote the
discharge time and mass of the active electrode material, respectively,
and ΔV is the potential drop during discharge.105 The charging–discharging curves of CZMS
and CZNP at a current density of 5.3 A g–1 within
the potential window between ±0.4 V are displayed in Figure 10a,b. The value
of the specific capacitance of CZNP (29.39 F g–1) was found to be lower than that of CZMS (31.45 F g–1), which is in good agreement with the findings of CV measurement
at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. The deviation from
linearity in the shape of the GCD curve indicates that the samples
are pseudocapacitive in nature.39 The symmetric
GCD curves indicate that the samples exhibit reversible performance
during faradaic reactions.39

Figure 10 Galvanostatic
charging–discharging behavior of (a) CZMS
and (b) CZNP at a current density of 5.3 A g–1.

To investigate the cyclic stability
of the samples, we have performed
the charging–discharging measurement up to 1000 cycles at a
current density of 5.3 A g–1. The cyclic performance
of CZMS is shown in Figure 11a, which indicates that the value of specific capacitance
of CZMS increases from 31.45 to 48.33 F g–1 up to
100 cycles, and thereafter, it is almost constant up to 1000 cycles. Figure 11b shows the variation
of specific capacitance of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles with respect to the cycle number.
The specific capacitance of CZNP increases slightly up to 100 cycles,
and afterward, it is remarkably stable over the increase in the number
of charging and discharging cycles. The specific capacitances (CS) of CZMS and CZNP vary almost similarly with
the increase of the cycle number, and the nature of the CS versus cycle number curves can be explained considering
how the electroactive sites get exposed and utilized with the increase
of the cycle number. At the initial cycles of the charging/discharging
processes, the electrochemical active materials remain partially wetted
by the electrolyte. It is thus only the surface sites that are available
for charge storage, and hence, the efficiency of charge transfer is
low. With increasing GCD cycles, through continuous ion intercalations
and deintercalations, more and more inner electroactive sites get
recognized and utilized, and as a result, the capacitance rises until
it attains a constant value where most of the active sites get exposed
and exploited. Thus, this so-called “activated state”
is the cause of the above capacitance rise, which is greatly dependent
on the nature and morphology of the electrode material.107

Figure 11 The variations in the values of specific capacitance
(CS) with the cycle number of (a) CZMS
and (b) CZMP are
shown for 1000 cycles measured at a current density of 5.3 A g–1.

We have recorded the
FESEM micrograph of the sample before and
after the performance of 1000 cycles of charging and discharging,
and the micrographs are depicted in Figure S9. It is observed from the FESEM micrographs that some of the hierarchical
spherical microstructures have broken into an irregular agglomeration
of nanoparticles with the increase of the number of cycles. This phenomenon
leads to the increase in porosity of the sample, and these pores adsorb
the electrolytes during the charging and discharging process, which
in turn increases the specific capacitance of the sample.108

Electrochemical Sensing of H2O2
To probe the potentials of CZMS and CZNP toward
the electrochemical
reduction of H2O2, the cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) of the samples were studied in the potential window of −0.2
to −0.6 V at a fixed potential scan rate of 10 mV s–1 with varying H2O2 concentrations (0, 0.058,
1.18, and 1.47 mM) in a 0.1 M aqueous NaOH electrolyte, and the results
are displayed in Figure 12.

Figure 12 CVs of (a) CZMS and (b) CZNP with increasing concentrations of
H2O2 in 0.1 M NaOH at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1.

The result suggests
that the reduction peaks at about −0.42
and −0.45 V for CZMS and CZNP, respectively, get intensified
with the increase of the molar concentration of H2O2, signifying electrochemical reduction of H2O2 on the electrode surface. It has also been observed that,
with the increase of the molar concentration of H2O2, the peak current increases gradually.15 It is assumed that Co2+ ions in the electrode
material reduce H2O2 to H2O and get
oxidized to Co3+ ions plausibly. Thus, these results indicate
that CZNP and CZMS can act as nonenzymatic biosensors of H2O2.

The nonenzymatic H2O2 sensing
properties
of CZMS and CZNP were further investigated by the amperometric method.
The amperometric current–time response graphs (Figure 13a,b) of CZMS and CZNP were
recorded by varying the molar concentration of H2O2 in the 0.1 M aqueous NaOH electrolyte at applied reduction
potentials of −0.42 and – 0.45 V for CZMS and CZNP,
respectively, with reference to the saturated calomel electrode. From
the current–time response profiles of the samples, it is clear
that the current decreases more rapidly in the case of CZNP compared
to CZMS with the elapse of time. It is well known that the decrease
in current density can be ascribed to the accumulation of adsorbed
reaction intermediates on the surface of the active sites in the electrodes.109 As the surface to volume ratio for a nanomaterial
is substantially higher than that for its microstructural counterpart,
it is obvious that more adsorption of the reaction product over the
electrode of CZNP will take place in comparison to the electrode of
CZMS. Thus, the rapid decrease of current density in the case of CZNP
compared to CZMS is expected. From Figure13, it is evident that both samples swiftly
respond to H2O2 and the average times required
to reach a steady state current are 42 and 8 s for CZNP and CZMS,
respectively. CZMS and CZNP respond linearly to H2O2 in the concentration range from 58 μM to 4.12 mM and
29 μM to 11.76 mM, respectively, with values of correlation
coefficient (R2) of 0.99 and 0.98 for
CZMS and CZNP, respectively (Figure 14a,b). From the slope of the fitted straight line curves
of current density versus molar concentration of H2O2, we have estimated the sensitivity of the samples as the
H2O2 sensor. The values of sensitivity for CZMS
and CZNP are 22.73 and 5.42 μA mM–1 cm–2, respectively, and the values of the lower detection
limit are 58.8 and 29.4 μM, respectively, toward H2O2 detection. Thus, CZMS is electrochemically more active
than CZNP, and it exhibits high sensitivity and rapid response toward
the detection of H2O2. It can be concluded that
the self-assembly of nanoparticles in microspherical morphology plays
an important role in determining the electrochemical activity of these
samples. It may further be noted that the band gap energy of CZMS
is lower than that of CZNP. It may therefore be inferred that CZMS
exhibits better electrochemical activity than CZNP due to its lower
band gap energy. The values of sensitivity, linear range, and lower
detection limit have been compared with those of several oxides, spinel
nanostructures, nanocomposites, and microstructures, and the outcome
is summarized in Table 5. It has been observed that the Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 microsphere based electrode has moderate sensitivity
toward H2O2 sensing.

Conclusions
Three-dimensional self-assembled hierarchical microspheres of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 have been successfully
synthesized by a facile, one-pot, and low-temperature solvothermal
method. The structural, microstructural, optical, magnetic, and hyperfine
properties of the sample have been thoroughly investigated by PXRD,
FESEM, HRTEM, FTIR, DRS, PL, dc magnetic, and Mössbauer spectroscopic
studies. The Rietveld refinement of the PXRD pattern suggests that
the sample under investigation is single-phase cubic spinel ferrite,
which crystallizes in the Fd-3m space
group. The PXRD and HRTEM studies suggest that CZMS with an average
diameter of ∼121 nm is composed of individual Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 ferrite nanoparticles
of ∼10 nm size. The dc magnetic and Mössbauer spectroscopic
studies indicate that CZMS is ferrimagnetic in nature at low temperature
and at room temperature; it exhibits the collective magnetic state
due to strong interparticle interaction. Although the size of the
individual particles of CZMS is well below the superparamagnetic size
limit, the superparamagnetic relaxation in CZMS has been considerably
masked by the strong interparticle interaction originated from aggregate
formation. The values of MS for CZMS are
considerably higher than those for its nanoparticle counterparts.
The Lorentzian fitting of the infield Mössbauer spectrum suggests
that the cation configuration of the system is (Zn2+0.46Fe3+0.54)A[Zn2+0.24Co2+0.3Fe3+1.46]BO4, which is different from the equilibrium
cation distribution. The electrochemical properties of CZMS and CZNP
were investigated by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic
charging–discharging (GCD) measurements. Both the CV and GCD
measurements indicate that the values of specific capacitance of CZMS
are higher than those of CZNP. We have also recorded the CV of the
samples in different concentrations of H2O2 to
probe the potentials of CZMS and CZNP toward the electrochemical reduction
of H2O2. The results suggest that both CZMS
and CZNP can detect H2O2 and CZMS has better
sensitivity toward the detection of H2O2 than
CZNP. It has been found that CZMS exhibits better electrochemical
activity than CZNP due to its self-assembled spherical morphology
and lower band gap energy than CZNP. Thus, it can be inferred that
CZMS-based sensors are more electrochemically active than CZNP-based
H2O2 sensors.
