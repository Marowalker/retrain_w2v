The
present work, based on various spectroscopic investigations,
vividly demonstrates the self-association of Nile red (NR) in aqueous
medium. The rapid decrease in the absorbance as well as emission of
NR in water bears the signature of the aggregation process. Appearance
of a new blue-shifted absorption band in addition to the original
one and a drastic decrease in the emission intensity imply that the
aggregation is of H-type. Poor solubility of NR in water, hydrophobic
interaction, and the planar structure of the dye are ascribed to favor
the formation of the aggregate in the aqueous medium. Absorption-based
kinetic studies reveal the aggregation process to be second order,
thereby establishing the aggregate to be a dimer. Similar kinetic
profiles of the absorbance of NR in the presence and absence of light
confirm that the aggregation process is not photoassisted. The presence
of an isosbestic point in the absorbance spectra and an isoemissive
point in the time-resolved area normalized emission spectra bears
the evidence of equilibrium between the dimeric and the monomeric
species of NR in the ground state as well as in the photoexcited state.
Encapsulation of the monomer of NR within the hydrophobic cavity of
β-cyclodextrin is demonstrated to prevent the aggregation process.

1 Introduction
Aggregation of dye molecules
has acquired much importance because
of their versatile optoelectronic applications as photosensitizers,1 environment-sensitive dyes,2 designers of artificial light-harvesting antenna complexes,
and so forth.3,4 Nature also exploits the electronic
properties of the molecular aggregates in light-harvesting systems
where chlorophyll chromophores are responsible for the energy-transfer
process in the photosynthetic reactors.5

Most of the interesting photophysical properties of these
aggregates
originate from the strong coupling between the transition dipole moments
of the adjacent dye molecules, leading to new electronic excitations
delocalized over more than one monomer units.6 On the basis of the spatial orientations of the monomer units in
the aggregates, two types of aggregates are characterized. In the
first case, the absorption band corresponding to the aggregated form
is bathochromically shifted with respect to that of the monomer band
and in the second case, a blue-shifted band arises for the aggregated
species. The former one is designated as J-aggregate as a tribute
to Jelley,7 and the latter one is termed
as H-aggregate for its distinctive hypsochromic shift of the absorption
band.8 It is generally observed that end-to-end
interaction between the dye molecules results in J-aggregates and
H-aggregates are formed because of the π–π stacking
of the monomer dye units.6 Further, J-aggregates
are characterized by high fluorescence quantum yield, whereas H-aggregates
have remarkably reduced fluorescence.6,8 The characteristic
shifts in the absorption spectrum due to the self-association of the
dye molecules are explained in terms of molecular exciton coupling
theory, that is, coupling of the transition moments of the constituent
dye molecules.8 Many theories have been
proposed to explain the nature of the forces facilitating the self-association
of the molecules in solution.9,10 The forces such as
van der Waals interaction, intermolecular hydrogen bonding, dispersion
force, hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding with solvents, electrostatic
interaction, and so forth play significant roles for the aggregation
phenomenon.

9-Diethylamino-5-benzo[a]phenoxazinone,
commonly
known as Nile red (NR) (Scheme 1A), has acquired much attention during the past few decades
owing to its intense fluorescence in various media and its solvatochromic
behavior.11−17 A twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) state that arises
due to the rotation of the diethylamino group attached to the rigid
structure of the molecule rationalizes the positive solvatochromism
of the fluorophore.18 The large spectral
shifts in the absorption and emission bands in solvents of different
polarities indicate nearly complete CT from the diethylamino group
acting as an electron donor to the quinoid part acting as an electron
acceptor. Because of its extreme sensitivity toward solvent polarity,
NR has been exploited to study various microheterogeneous environments
such as micelles, reverse micelles, cyclodextrins, liposomes, proteins,
DNA, zeolites, and so forth.15,17−26 It has also been successfully used as an effective marker to develop
simple but prospective strategies to deliver model drugs to targets
as well as to excrete excess adsorbed drugs from the cell membranes.27−30

Scheme 1 Skeletal Structures of (A) NR and (B) β-CD
Though NR is extensively used to monitor different
hydrophobic
environments, poor solubility in water (<1 μg mL–1)12 has restricted its use in the aqueous
medium. Dutta et al. indicated the formation of organized aggregates
of NR in binary solvent mixtures.18 Recently,
Kurniasih et al. have reported the formation of nonemissive dimers
or H-type aggregates of the dye in the aqueous surfactant and/or micellar
solution.31 This interesting behavior of
NR prompted us to unravel the intricacies underlying its behavior
in the aqueous medium exploiting various steady-state and time-resolved
spectroscopic techniques, and it has been categorically demonstrated
that NR indeed forms H-aggregate in the aqueous medium even at very
low concentration (micromolar range). Moreover, through host–guest
interaction, it has been shown that in the presence of β-cyclodextrin
(β-CD) (Scheme 1B), the aggregation of NR is prevented because of the formation of
the inclusion complex between NR and β-CD.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Aggregation of NR in Water
2.1.1 Absorption Studies
Absorption spectra
of NR in water, methanol (MeOH), and n-heptane (Figure 1) depict large bathochromic
shift of the absorption maximum with increasing solvent polarity.
This observation is rationalized from the stabilization of the CT
state of the dye in solvents of higher polarity.18 As various classes of dye molecules, such as cyanines,6 xanthenes,32−34 coumarins,35−39 phenazinium dyes,40 and
so forth, form molecular aggregates revealing development of additional
bands in their absorption spectra, the absorption spectra of NR were
studied in three different solvents as a function of concentration
of the dye.

Figure 1 Normalized absorption spectra of NR in water, methanol, and n-heptane.

With increasing concentration of NR in MeOH and n-heptane, neither any deformity nor any new band was observed in
the absorption spectra of the probe. The absorbance values in both
these solvents followed Beer’s law negating the chance of the
formation of any aggregated species. However, in water, the absorption
spectrum became broad (Figure 2A) and the absorbance values with a variation of concentration
deviated from Beer’s law (Figure 2B). These observations suggest the formation
of aggregates of NR in the aqueous medium.

Figure 2 (A) Absorption spectra
of NR in water as a function of its concentration.
The concentrations of NR are provided in the legends. (B) Plot for
verification of Beer’s law.

It is pertinent to mention here that the initial color of
the aqueous
solution of NR readily faded out on standing. However, no such fading
of color was observed for the solutions of NR in MeOH and n-heptane. To account for this observation, the absorbance
values at the corresponding absorption maxima (λmax) of NR in these three solvents were plotted as a function of time
(Figure 3A). Figure 3A clearly depicts
that there is negligible change in the absorbance values of NR in
MeOH and n-heptane even on keeping the solutions
for 1 h. On the contrary, a fast decay of the absorbance was observed
in water which justifies the disappearance of color and indicates
the self-association of NR in the aqueous medium. Poor solubility
of NR in water, hydrophobic interaction, and the π–π
stacking interaction owing to its planar structure (see Quantum Chemical Calculations) are ascribed to
play roles for the formation of its aggregate in the aqueous medium.

[NR] = 6 μM.

To investigate whether
the aggregation of NR in water is photoinduced
or not, the decay of the absorbance was studied both in the presence
and absence of light. To carry out the experiment, the same concentrations
of NR were taken in two identical cells and the absorbance values
of both the solutions were monitored. One of the cells was kept under
constant illumination in the spectrophotometer, and the other one
was under dark. At different time intervals, the absorbances of both
the solutions were noted and plotted against time (Figure 3B). Identical decay profiles
of the absorbances for both the situations rule out the process to
be photoassisted.

To study the ground state aggregation of NR
in the aqueous medium,
single-shot absorption spectra were recorded at different times. Figure 4A portraying the
alteration in the absorption spectrum of the dye in aqueous medium
at different times reveals that the absorbance at 580 nm (λmax) decreased and the spectra got widened with the progress
of time giving rise to a new band at around 475 nm, resulting in an
isosbestic point. Apparent rise in the absorbance values at the longer
wavelength region of the spectrum (700–850 nm) is because of
the modification of the baseline reflecting increased turbidity of
the solution.35 Presence of any new band
in this red-shifted region was discarded from the emission study (vide
infra). The new blue-shifted band peaking at ∼475 nm is attributed
to the H-aggregate of NR. Resolution of the absorption spectrum of
NR after aggregation gave two distinct peaks at 478 and 576 nm (Figure 4B) corresponding
to the aggregated and the monomeric forms of NR, respectively. Appearance
of the isosbestic point establishes that the aggregate form remains
in equilibrium with the monomeric form in the ground state.

times. The legends contain corresponding time intervals in seconds.

2.1.2 Absorption-Based
Kinetic Study of the Aggregation
Process
To shed light on the kinetic aspect of the aggregation
process and to assess the nature of aggregation, decays of the absorbances
with varying initial concentrations of NR in aqueous solutions were
monitored at 580 nm (Figure 5A). Figure 5A reveals that with an increase in the initial concentration of the
dye, decay of the absorbance became faster. From the decays, the half-life
(t1/2) values were determined and they
are listed against the initial concentrations of NR in Table 1.

Figure 5 (A) Decay of the absorbance
of aqueous solution of NR at different
initial concentrations. The legends give the concentrations of NR.
(B) Plot of the half-life (t1/2) values
against initial concentrations of NR in aqueous solutions.

4.15	205	
3.0	242	
2.1	404	
1.67	420	
1.36	627	
As the
half-life values are dependent on the initial concentrations
of NR, it is obvious that the decay process does not follow first-order
kinetics. An acceptable linearity of the half-life values against
inverse of the initial concentrations of NR (Figure 5B) passing through the origin establishes
the process to follow a second-order kinetics. The rate constant of
the aggregation process was also determined from the plot which came
out to be 1.25 × 103 L mol–1 s–1 at 300 K. Thus, the kinetic analysis establishes
that the aggregate of NR is a dimeric species.

2.1.3 Emission Studies
In addition to
the absorption studies, fluorescence and fluorescence excitation spectra
were also investigated to identify the aggregated form of NR in water.
On exciting the aqueous solution of the dye at 580 nm, the peak maximum
of the emission band was obtained at 656 nm (Figure 6A) that corresponds to the monomeric form
of NR in water. Figure 6A further reveals that the emission intensity of NR in water decreased
steadily with time. This substantial decrease in the emission intensity
is attributed to the formation of the H-dimer of the dye in the solution
as it is known that the H-aggregates have remarkably low fluorescence
quantum yields.6,8 Because of the formation of the
dimer, a blue shift (∼4 nm) was observed in the emission peak
maximum of NR with the passage of time (inset of Figure 6A). In accordance with the
absorption spectrum (Figure 4), when the aqueous solution of NR was excited at 470 nm,
an emission spectrum of broad nature (Figure 6B, red) was obtained. On resolving the spectrum,
one peak of higher intensity at 635 nm (green) and another peak of
much lower intensity at 607 nm (blue) (inset of Figure 6B) were obtained. The peak with higher intensity
is ascribed to the monomeric form and that with lower intensity is
attributed to the H-dimer of NR. To establish that the apparent increase
in the absorbance in the red region (700–850 nm) in the absorption
spectrum of NR (Figure 4) is not due to any new species, the aqueous solution of the dye
was excited at 750 nm that yielded no emission. On the basis of all
of these experimental findings, any chance of the formation of J-aggregate
was ruled out.

times.

emission spectra of NR at two different times. (B) Normalized excitation
and emission spectra of the aqueous solution of NR. Excitation and
monitoring wavelengths are provided in the legends. The inset depicts
the resolved emission spectrum of an aqueous solution of NR when excited
at 470 nm.

To capture the fluorescence excitation
spectra corresponding to
NR and its H-dimer, monitoring wavelengths were chosen at two extremes
of the emission spectra, that is, at 680 and 620 nm (Figure 6B). Monitoring at 680 and 620
nm, the excitation maxima were found to be at 588 and 500 nm (with
a hump at around 450 nm in the latter case), respectively. The excitation
maximum at 500 nm agreed with the blue-shifted absorption band (Figure 4) corresponding to
the H-dimer of NR. These two visibly different excitation spectra
(blue and olive) confirmed the existence of two different ground state
species in the solution.

2.1.4 Time-Resolved Emission
Studies
The time-resolved emission measurement serves as
a very useful tool
to investigate the excited-state behavior of NR in the aqueous medium.
The lifetime values of the monomeric form of NR monitoring at 680
nm and that of the dimeric form monitoring at 600 nm were both in
the picosecond region, being 443 ± 5020,22 and 565 ± 50 ps, respectively. Even this small difference in
the lifetime values prompted us to perform the time-resolved area
normalized emission spectral (TRANES) measurements41−43 within the
wavelength region 580–750 nm (Figure 7) to find out if there is any equilibrium
between the monomeric and the dimeric forms of NR in the photoexcited
state. With increasing time, the band around 615 nm increased at the
cost of the band at 665 nm. Clear observation of an isoemissive point
at 644 nm unequivocally ascertained the coexistence of the two different
species of NR and confirmed the equilibrium between the monomeric
and dimeric species of NR in its excited state. Similar coexistence
of the monomer and aggregates of various coumarin dyes has been recently
demonstrated by Verma and Pal through TRANES study.38,39

2.2 Effect of β-CD on the Aggregation Process
2.2.1 Absorption Studies
In the present
work, our target was to find out if the self-association of NR in
the aqueous medium could be prevented by host–guest interaction.
For the purpose, β-CD was chosen as the suitable host as the
interaction of NR with β-CD has already been investigated in
detail by several groups22,24,29,30 and the formation of 1:1 NR−β-CD
inclusion complex is confirmed by steady-state and time-resolved measurements.24 We intended to avoid the unwanted complications
arising out of the multiple probe/CD stoichiometries (such as 1:1,
1:2, and 2:1) in γ-CD because of its bigger cavity size25 and therefore chose β-CD as the host to
study the preventive action of the CD toward aggregation of NR in
the simplest situation as β-CD is known to form 1:1 complex
with NR. To divulge the effect of β-CD on the aggregation process
of NR in water, we designed our experiments in two ways. In the first
case, the stock solution of NR was directly added to 8 mM aqueous
solution of β-CD and thoroughly shaken to make the solution
homogeneous. Under this situation, the bluish color of the solution
persisted for a much longer time which is evident from the single-shot
absorption spectra of the solution (Figure 8A), showing negligible spectral change with
time. A comparison of the kinetic profiles of the absorbance of NR
at 580 nm in the presence of β-CD with that in the aqueous medium
(Figure 8B) implied
that the aggregation of NR was prevented in the presence of β-CD.

Figure 8 (A) Single-shot
absorption spectra of an aqueous solution of NR
in the presence of 8 mM β-CD at different times. The legends
represent corresponding times in seconds. (B) Decays of the absorbances
of NR in water and in 8 mM β-CD solution. [NR] = 6 μM.

In the second case, an aqueous
solution of NR was kept overnight
to allow completion of the aggregation process. The broad nature of
the absorption spectrum of this solution clearly bears the signature
of the H-dimer of NR in the solution together with its monomeric form
(Figure 9A). With the
gradual addition of β-CD to this aqueous solution of NR, the
absorbance of the hypsochromically shifted band corresponding to the
dimeric form decreased and that of the monomer band increased (Figure 9A). This is because
in the presence of β-CD, the monomeric form of NR got encapsulated
within its hydrophobic cavity, thereby shifting the existing equilibrium
between the monomeric and the dimeric forms of NR toward the monomer
in accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle.44 Plot of the absorbance values at 580 nm (absorption
maximum of the monomer) against the concentrations of β-CD (Figure 9B) revealed that
the absorbance of the monomer increased gradually until the final
attainment of a plateau region.

medium with the addition
of β-CD. The legends contain the concentrations of β-CD.
(B) Variation of the absorbance of the aqueous solution of NR at 580
nm as a function of β-CD.

2.2.2 Emission Studies
Steady-state emission
measurements were performed to monitor the spectral modifications
of an aqueous solution of NR in the presence of β-CD. From Figure 10A, it was observed
that the emission intensity of NR in the aqueous medium increased
steadily with the addition of β-CD because of the gradual increase
in the monomeric form of NR at the cost of the H-dimer. A blue shift
of ∼7 nm in the emission maximum indicated that the probe entered
into a relatively less polar environment relative to water which,
in turn, implied its encapsulation within the cavity of the β-CD.22,24,29,30 The emission intensity gradually increased with increasing concentration
of β-CD and finally attained a plateau (Figure 10B) revealing a similar pattern as observed
for its absorbance in a similar situation.

of NR with the addition of β-CD. The
legends contain the concentrations of β-CD. (B) Variation of
the fluorescence intensity of NR solution with the addition of β-CD.

2.3 Fluorescence
Anisotropy Study
Fluorescence
anisotropy serves as a useful tool to assay the rotational restriction
imposed on a fluorophore by its immediate environment.45 In most of the low viscous pure solvents, the
photoexcited fluorophore rotates very fast within its fluorescence
lifetime, revealing very low (close to zero) values of fluorescence
anisotropy. However, increase in the viscosity of the medium or enhanced
effective volume of the probe due to some specific interaction within
the probe molecules (like formation of aggregates, as in the present
case) or between the probe and the solvent might restrict the rotation
process leading to an increase in its fluorescence anisotropy.45,46

Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurement was exploited
in the present work because different effective volumes of the monomer,
dimer, and β-CD encapsulated monomer of NR are expected to influence
the rotational motion and hence the fluorescence anisotropy values
of NR differently. To monitor the anisotropy of the monomer of NR
in water, the excitation and monitoring wavelengths were chosen as
580 and 680 nm, respectively. On the other hand, for the dimer, 470
and 620 nm were selected as the corresponding wavelengths for reasons
already discussed. The same sets of measurements were also carried
out in the presence of 8 mM β-CD. All of the fluorescence anisotropy
data are collected in Table 2. The table reveals that the fluorescence anisotropy of NR
monitored at 620 nm is much higher than that at 680 nm, indicating
that the effective volume of the dimer is appreciably larger than
that of the monomer, as expected. The slight enhanced fluorescence
anisotropy of the monomer upon addition of β-CD provides evidence
of its encapsulation within the cyclodextrin cavity.22,30 On the contrary, the anisotropy value monitored for the dimer form
in the presence of β-CD was reduced from its value in water
as the equilibrium was shifted toward the monomer. However, the anisotropy
value did not go down to the anisotropy value of the monomer in water
because the contributions came from the β-CD-encapsulated complex
as well as from some amount of dimer of NR present in the system.

2.4 Dynamic
Light Scattering Measurements
To get further support in favor
of the size-related conclusions drawn
from the fluorescence anisotropy measurements of the different species
of NR, dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique was adopted to get
an idea about their dimensions in solution. Figure 11 portrays the size distribution of an aqueous
solution of NR in different situations. A sharp size distribution
with a peak at ∼1.2 nm was obtained for a freshly prepared
aqueous solution of NR containing mainly its monomer. On keeping this
solution overnight, the size distribution, as expected, was found
to be a broad one with a peak at ∼2 nm. Higher hydrodynamic
diameter of the H-dimer formed in the aqueous solution, kept overnight,
accounted for this observation, and the broader nature of the size
distribution suggested existence of both the monomeric and dimeric
species in this solution of NR.

Figure 11 Size (diameter) distribution of NR in
different conditions.

To divulge the effect of β-CD, first, the hydrodynamic
diameter
of only β-CD was measured and the diameter came out to be ∼1.7
nm which is in good agreement with the literature reports.47 In the presence of NR, the diameter of β-CD
was found to be ∼1.8 nm which might be due to the entrapment
of the monomer in the cavity of β-CD. Hence, from the DLS study,
it can be inferred that the effective dimensions of NR in different
environments are in accordance with that assessed from the fluorescence
anisotropy measurements.

2.5 Quantum Chemical Calculations
Quantum
chemical calculations were exploited to rationalize the experimental
findings and to find out the probable geometries or orientations of
the NR monomers in forming the H-dimer. The energy minimized geometry
of NR monomer in the aqueous medium was obtained at the density functional
theory (DFT) level using Becke’s three-parameter hybrid functional
B3 with the nonlocal correlation function of Lee–Yang–Parr
abbreviated as B3LYP with the basis set 6-311++G**.48−50 The resultant
geometry was found to be planar in nature (Figure 12A) with two ethyl groups sticking out of
the plane in the opposite directions. This planar geometry of NR goes
very much in favor of formation of the H-dimer.

Figure 12 (A) Global energy minimized
structures of monomer form, (B) cis
dimer, and (C) trans dimer of NR. Atomic notations—gray: carbon,
off-white: hydrogen, red: oxygen, and blue: nitrogen.

Different orientations of the NR monomers to form
the H-dimer of
the dye were optimized at the same level as exploited for the monomer
(Figure 12B,C). The
cis dimer is defined as the one in which the individual heterocyclic
oxygen/nitrogen atoms are located face-to-face. On the contrary, the
trans dimer has the heterocyclic oxygen of one monomer facing the
nitrogen atom of the other one. It was found that the cis dimer (E = −7.6 kcal mol–1) was energetically
more stabilized over the trans (E = −3.1 kcal
mol–1) by 4.5 kcal mol–1.

To provide additional support to the formation of the H-dimer of
NR, an endeavor was made to justify the experimental absorption spectrum
of NR. Making use of our limited facility of the quantum chemical
calculations, the simulated absorption spectrum of the NR monomer
was obtained with a peak maximum at 564 nm in water which qualitatively
agreed with the experimental one. On the other hand, the simulated
absorption spectrum of the cis dimer with the peak maximum at 530
nm was found to be hypsochromically shifted compared to that of the
monomer peak of 564 nm. This blue-shifted simulated spectrum of cis
dimer of NR went in line with the hypsochromically shifted absorption
band for the H-dimer found experimentally and thus validated the aggregation
of the probe in water.

2.6 Molecular Docking Study
Molecular
docking simulation was carried out to perceive the mode/pattern of
encapsulation of NR monomer within the cavity of β-CD.51−54 The most stable docked conformer of NR in β-CD was found to
have the phenoxazone moiety of the NR monomer entering through the
primary/wider rim of the β-CD and protruding out of the secondary/narrower
rim. For clarity, different projectional views of the most stable
docked conformer of NR have been demonstrated in Figure 13. On docking the dimer to
β-CD several times, the most stable docked conformer of the
monomer was obtained repeatedly. Thus, it confirmed that the dimer
is big enough to enter the cavity of the β-CD and in the presence
of β-CD, the NR monomer is really encapsulated within CD resulting
in the shift of the equilibrium from the dimer toward the monomer.

the narrower opening of β-CD, and (C) side view.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
the self-association of NR in the aqueous medium
has been established emphatically through vivid spectroscopic investigations.
Its poor solubility in water and hydrophobic interaction along with
the π–π stacking interaction favored by its planar
structure are accounted for the formation of the aggregate in the
aqueous medium. The hypsochromic shift in the absorption spectrum
and drastic decrease in the emission intensity with the passage of
time confirm that the self-association of NR is of H-type. Absorption-based
kinetic studies establish the H-aggregate to be a dimeric species.
The presence of an isosbestic point in the absorption spectra and
an isoemissive point in the TRANES reveals the existence of equilibrium
between the H-dimer and the monomer of NR in both ground and excited
electronic states. The experimental results are rationalized from
the quantum chemical calculations and molecular docking studies. Exploiting
the host–guest chemistry of NR with β-CD, it is demonstrated
that the formation of the dimer of NR is prevented in the presence
of β-CD because of the encapsulation of the monomeric form of
NR within the hydrophobic cavity of β-CD.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
NR, β-CD, and spectroscopic
grade solvents, that is, methanol and n-heptane were
procured from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and used without further purification.
Deionized water from a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore)
was used for making all of the aqueous solutions.

4.2 Methods
To overcome the solubility
problem of NR in water, a concentrated stock solution of the dye was
prepared in methanol. Different steady-state and time-resolved experiments
were performed using a very small amount of the methanol stock solution
of the dye in water. By using different amounts of the stock solution
of NR in methanol, the concentration variation studies were performed
in the aqueous medium. The volumes of methanol in the final experimental
solutions were kept below 2%. All of the experiments were performed
in air equilibrated solutions at room temperature (300 K).

Absorption
studies were carried out on a Shimadzu UV-2450 absorption spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). Single-shot absorption spectra at different
time intervals were acquired with a PerkinElmer UV/visible spectrophotometer
(model no. 8453). A HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer
was employed for steady-state fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy
measurements. Fluorescence anisotropy (r) is defined
as45  where IVV and IVH are the emission intensities obtained with
the excitation and emission polarizers set at (0°, 0°) and
(0°, 90°), respectively. The G factor is
given by45  where IHV and IHH correspond
to the emission signals for excitation
and emission polarizers set at (90°, 0°) and (90°,
90°), respectively.

A FluoroCube instrument (Horiba Jobin
Yvon), with a laser diode
(IBH, UK) working at 560 nm and a TBX photon detector, was used for
the time-resolved fluorescence decay measurements, adopting the time-correlated
single-photon counting technique.45 The
technical details regarding fluorescence lifetime measurements have
already been described in some of our earlier works.22,30 Time-resolved emission spectral (TRES) measurements of NR in water
was performed on the same Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoroCube instrument
over the entire emission spectral range (580–750 nm) with an
interval of 2 nm. At each preset wavelength, the emission was collected
for a period of 180 s. The emission spectra were sliced for a distinct
time window at different decay times. Time-resolved area normalized
emission spectra were constructed by normalizing the areas under the
individual emission spectra obtained from the TRES measurements using
the Origin 7.5 software.41−43 Smoothing on the raw data of
TRANES was performed by exploiting the Origin software to increase
the clarity of the set of spectra, without distorting the science
in it.

DLS measurements were performed using a Nano-ZS90 Malvern
instrument
(model DLS-nano ZS, Zetasizer, Nano series) equipped with a 4 mW He–Ne
laser (λ = 632.8 nm) and a thermostatic sample chamber. The
hydrodynamic sizes of the samples were measured using DTS software
associated with the instrument. Prior to the measurements, samples
were filtered through a 0.10 μm syringe filter (Merck Millipore
Ltd.) to remove any dust particle.

Quantum chemical calculations
were performed using Gaussian 09
software48 for obtaining the energy minimized
structure of NR. The ground state calculations were carried out using
DFT with Becke’s three-parameter hybrid functional B3 with
nonlocal correlation function of Lee–Yang–Parr abbreviated
as B3LYP49,50 with the basis set 6-311++G**. To assess
the effect of solvent on the ground state, the conductor polarizable
continuum model55,56 was employed.

AutoDock-vina
program (version 1.1.2) from The Scripps Research
Institute57−59 was exploited for the molecular docking simulations.
For the docking study, the geometries of the monomer and the dimer
of NR were first optimized using the Gaussian 09 program48 and the output files were converted into compatible
Protein Data Bank (PDB) files. The required crystal structure of β-CD
was obtained from PDB. Prior to the docking study, MGL Tools (version
1.5.6) were used to convert the receptor and ligand coordinate files
into PDBQT format. A three-dimensional grid box of dimension 40 ×
40 × 40 was constructed with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å.
The grid box was created in such a fashion that it would be large
enough to include not only the respective CD cavities but also the
whole CD structures. For docking simulation, 20 different conformations
were taken into account to find out the lowest energy docked conformer.
The PyMOL software package was used for visualization of the docked
poses and analyzing the corresponding conformations.60
