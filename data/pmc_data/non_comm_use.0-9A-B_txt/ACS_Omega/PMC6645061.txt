Monoclinic β-Ga2O3 nanosheets hold
great potential applications in electronic, optical, and photocatalytic
fields. In this study, two-dimensional β-Ga2O3 nanosheets were successfully fabricated through a simple
crystalline phase transition from the as-prepared ultrathin γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
reaction under UV light irradiation was achieved on the two kinds
of photocatalysts. However, β-Ga2O3 with
a higher crystallinity shows a lower photocatalytic activity in comparison
with γ-Ga2O3. The average apparent quantum
yield is calculated to be 0.29% for β-Ga2O3 nanosheets and 1.82% for γ-Ga2O3. More
efficient separation and transfer rates of photogenerated carriers
and larger specific areas were found in γ-Ga2O3. On the basis of the analysis of the structures of γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3, it
is proposed that the disordered or defective structure contributes
to the improvement of photocatalytic activity to some extent. Therefore,
it is significant to develop the photocatalyst with a stable structure
and a certain number of defects at the same time.

Introduction
Photocatalytic hydrogen
evolution is an attractive scientific and
technological goal to address the increasing global demand for clean
energy and to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and carbon dioxide
emission.1−3 Tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop a
more efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution during the past
several decades.4−6 As a result, various kinds of photocatalysts have
been developed. Among all of these photocatalyst materials, gallium
oxide (Ga2O3) has attracted intensive attention
because of its high conductivity and excellent photoluminescence (PL)
property resulting from the defect-rich structure.7 Moreover, Ga2O3 with a wide band
gap (∼4.7 eV) has a strong redox ability of the photogenerated
holes and electrons. Thus, Ga2O3 has displayed
a good photocatalytic activity for the organic pollutant decomposition.8 However, the photocatalytic activity of Ga2O3 toward the photocatalytic H2 evolution
was still very low, which was mainly due to the insufficient active
sites and high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers. To enhance
the photocatalytic activity, one of the popular strategies is to develop
Ga2O3 photocatalysts with excellent morphology
structure that can provide more efficient separation and transportation
rates of the photogenerated carriers and more active sites for photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution.

The ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials,
made of several
atomic layers, have received extensive interests in recent years9−11 because of their unique and fascinating properties distinct from
their bulk counterparts, including high exposed proportion of surface
atoms or surface-active sites and a minimum migration distance of
electrons and holes to achieve rapid carrier transport,12 which can contribute to the high photocatalytic
activity. Large numbers of nanosheet materials with single- or multilayer
thickness, such as transition-metal dichalcogenides, transition-metal
oxides, and layered-double hydroxides, have been prepared via the
exfoliation of their bulk layered counterparts13,14 or by the wet-chemical synthesis method.15,16 As an important semiconductor, β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure and is the most stable phase among various
crystal phases of Ga2O3 and has been applied
in a variety of areas, including optics,17 electronics,18 and particularly photocatalysis.19 However, to the best of our knowledge, β-Ga2O3 with a nanosheet morphology has been scarcely
studied because of its nonlayered structure. Our previous work has
successfully developed the freestanding single-layer nanosheets of
nonlayered material γ-Ga2O3 with unprecedented
thickness (∼1 nm) by a facile hydrothermal method without using
any kind of shape control agents.20 However,
the cubic γ-Ga2O3 is susceptible to the
environment and difficult to be well preserved. Therefore, the success
in γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets inspires us to prepare
β-Ga2O3 nanosheets—the most stable
among the five phases of Ga2O3—through
a crystalline phase transition of metastable γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets.

Herein, we report a template approach
for the synthesis of β-Ga2O3 nanosheets
through one-step thermal treatment
of ultrathin 2D γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets. The
thickness of as-prepared β-Ga2O3 nanosheets
is 1.35 nm, which did not change a lot in the nanosheet structure.
The photocatalytic reaction indicates that the phase structure greatly
affects the reaction activity. This work provides a template synthetic
strategy to achieve atomically thick 2D nanosheets of the nonlayered
material and will undoubtedly promote the understanding of the effects
of the crystal structure on the photocatalytic reaction.

Results and Discussion
The formation processes for β-Ga2O3 nanosheets are shown in Figure 1b. First, the ultrathin nanosheets of nonlayered material
γ-Ga2O3 were synthesized by a hydrothermal
method without using any shape-controlling agents, as indicated in
our previous work.20 In our previous work,
we have studied the surface property and thermal stability of the
γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets. With the increase
of the temperature, the physically adsorbed water would be lost and
the terminated OH groups reconfigured into water molecules, leading
to the partial structural collapse of γ-Ga2O3. The monoclinic β-Ga2O3 was obtained
through the in situ annealed reaction from the unstable cubic
phase γ-Ga2O3. As is reported, the crystalline
phase transition of the unstable cubic γ-Ga2O3 into monoclinic β-Ga2O3 can be
easily realized at this temperature,21 which
is also demonstrated by the X-ray power diffraction (XRD) analysis
shown in Figure 3.
Similar template synthesis research has also been reported in crystalline
GaN nanosheets, in which the γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets
with unstable structure and cubic crystallographic symmetry, as well
as the close lattice constants, enable a simple structure transition
from cubic γ-Ga2O3 to GaN nanosheets.22Figure 1a,c illustrates the crystal structural models of cubic γ-Ga2O3 and monoclinic β-Ga2O3. Obviously, the nanosheet morphology of γ-Ga2O3 is well reserved, and β-Ga2O3 nanosheets are obtained, as schematically illustrated in Figure 1d.

models of cubic γ-Ga2O3 and monoclinic
β-Ga2O3;
(b) preparation process of γ-Ga2O3 and
β-Ga2O3 nanosheets; and (d) schematic
diagram describing the phase transformation of β-Ga2O3 nanosheets from γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets.

The morphology and texture
of the β-Ga2O3 nanosheets were characterized
by the field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The
thickness of the samples was determined by the atomic force microscope
(AFM). As shown in SEM and TEM images (Figure 2a,b), the as-prepared β-Ga2O3 exhibits transparent and thin morphology of 2D nanosheets.
Obviously, after calcination of γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets at a high temperature (750 °C), the nanosheet morphology
is well preserved, except that the edges seem to be sharper and the
size of nanosheets is smaller as compared with that of γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets (Figure S1), revealing that the phase transition is not accompanied by a significant
change in symmetry.23 The HR-TEM elemental
mapping images shown in Figure 2c,d,g,h exhibit the distribution of elements in the nanosheets.
It can be clearly seen that Ga and O are uniformly distributed in
β-Ga2O3. Besides, the existence of the
elements was also confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy
shown in Figure S2. All of the elements
were clearly observed at their corresponding keV values. The HR-TEM
images of the samples shown in Figure S3 illustrate that the nanosheets exhibit interplanar distances of
0.250 and 0.255 nm, which correspond to the (311) and (111) planes
of γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3, respectively. In addition, the thickness of the β-Ga2O3 nanosheets evaluated by the AFM was approximately
1.35 nm, which did not change a lot in the thickness after the thermal
treatment (γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets: 1.25 nm).
These results reveal that it is perfectly possible to obtain the nanosheets
through the phase transformation by the template synthesis. To the
best of our knowledge, such ultrathin 2D nanosheets of β-Ga2O3 have rarely been reported. The optimal reaction
conditions to obtain more uniform and thinner nanosheets are being
explored, and we believe that the more uniform and thinner nanosheets
would possibly possess more excellent photocatalytic properties.

TEM images (a,b), TEM mapping (c,d,g,h), and AFM (e,f)
image and the corresponding height profiles of the as-prepared β-Ga2O3 nanosheets.

Figure 3 displays the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized
samples.
The phase transformation temperature was first investigated, as shown
in Figure 3a. As the
calcination temperature was 700 °C, the XRD indicates that β-Ga2O3 was formed and the characteristic peaks of γ-Ga2O3 were disappeared. When the temperature was further
increased to 750 °C, the characteristic XRD diffraction peaks
of β-Ga2O3 were observed. The strong and
sharp diffraction peaks are consistent with the standard data file
of β-Ga2O3. No other impurities were observed,
indicating that pure-phase β-Ga2O3 was
obtained. In addition, it is important to note that the diffraction
peak at 2θ degree of 35.2° is stronger than that of 31.7°
in the XRD pattern of β-Ga2O3, which is
not consistent with the standard diffraction peaks. As we mentioned
previously, the very strong diffraction peak of γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets at 36.19° demonstrates a (311) preferential
orientation.20 Therefore, it is speculated
that the strong diffraction peak at 2θ degrees of 35.2°
was caused by the preferential growth orientation of γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets at high temperature. The phenomenon
was obviously observed in Figure 3b.

calcination temperatures and (b) β-Ga2O3 in comparison with that of γ-Ga2O3.

The Raman spectra were carried
out to probe vibrational and structural
properties of the as-prepared samples. Figure 4 shows the Raman spectroscopy of the Ga2O3 samples obtained in ambient atmosphere with
an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. For β-Ga2O3, peaks at 202, 350, 417, 477, 630, 651, 767 cm–1 were observed, which are characteristic peaks of monoclinic β-Ga2O3.24 In contrast, only
several weak, broad bands attributed to the bending and stretching
of Ga–O bond can be observed in the Raman spectrum of γ-Ga2O3, which strongly confirms the low crystallinity
of γ-Ga2O3. These results are in consistent
with the XRD mentioned above.

of 532 nm) of the
as-prepared Ga2O3 samples.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
were used to determine the surface area and porous structure of the
samples, respectively. As depicted in Figure 5, a typical IV N2 adsorption isotherm
with H2- and H3-type hysteresis loops was observed for β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3, respectively,
indicating the presence of mesopores in the Ga2O3 samples.25,26 As reported in our previous work,
the γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets obtained through
hydrothermal reaction at low temperature result in the largest specific
surface area of 227.6 m2 g–1 among ever-reported
γ-Ga2O3 materials.23 Compared with γ-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3 obtained through the template synthesis exhibits
a relatively small specific surface area (73.7 m2 g–1). Even so, the specific surface area of β-Ga2O3 nanosheets is larger than most of the β-Ga2O3 with other morphologies. Besides, the β-Ga2O3 nanosheets possess a smaller pore volume (0.020
cm3 g–1) and larger average pore diameter
(5.7 nm) in comparison with γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets
(volume of 0.125 cm3 g–1 and average
diameter of 3.8 nm). It is expected that the differences in texture
properties of β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 would greatly influence their photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution performance.

curves and the pore
size distribution plots of β-Ga2O3.

The UV–vis absorption spectra
of the samples were performed
in the range of 250–450 nm, which were converted to absorption
spectra on the basis of the Kubelka–Munk theory,27 as shown in Figure 6. The optical absorption edges of β-
and γ-Ga2O3 are at 280 and 264 nm (Figure 6a), respectively,
which can be ascribed to the excitation of electrons from valence
band to conduction band. Obviously, the absorption edge of β-Ga2O3 is red shift of 16 nm in comparison with that
of γ-Ga2O3, possibly resulting from the
confined quantum effect of the nanosheets. The optical band gap (Eg) can be obtained using the Davis–Mott’s
empirical equation: αhν = B(hν – Eg)n/2, where hν,
α, B, and Eg represent
the photon energy, absorption coefficient, a constant related to the
material, and band gap, respectively. Moreover, n depends on the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor
(n = 1 for direct transition; n =
4 for indirect transition).28 Therefore,
the band gap energy of the Ga2O3 samples could
be estimated from a plot of (αhν)2 versus the energy of light (hν). As
shown in the inset of Figure 6a, the band gap energies of β- and γ-Ga2O3 are evaluated to be 4.43 and 4.68 eV, respectively,
which agree well with the previously reported results.29Figure 6b depicts the Mott–Schottky plots of both Ga2O3 samples conducted at a frequency of 0.5 kHz. The positive
slopes of the Mott–Schottky plots indicate that the two samples
are n-type semiconductors.30 The intercepts
on the abscissa display the flat-band potentials of the samples. It
is obvious that the flat-band potential of β-Ga2O3 is more positive than that of γ-Ga2O3 by 0.1 V. As the flat-band potential is located near the
conduction band in the n-type semiconductor, it was normally considered
as the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor. Combining the
result from the UV–vis absorption spectra with the flat-band
potentials of the samples, the approximate band-edge positions of
the samples can be obtained, as shown in Figure 6c. The more positive conduction band minimum
of β-Ga2O3 nanosheets may be detrimental
to the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, leading
to a lower photocatalytic activity.31

light (hν); (b) Mott–Schottky plots

by optical absorption and typical electrochemical Mott–Schottky
methods.

Figure 7 shows the
typical PL spectra of the Ga2O3 nanosheets performed
at room temperature with the excitation wavelength of 250 nm. It can
be found that β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets exhibit strong emission peaks centered
at 587 and 374 nm, respectively. Compared with γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets, β-Ga2O3 nanosheets
show an obvious red shift of 213 nm and a much weaker intensity. The
PL of Ga2O3 has been reported by many studies.32−34 Noteworthy, the emission wavelengths are 587 nm (2.11 eV) and 374
nm (3.31 eV) for β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3, respectively, which are smaller than the band
gaps of the samples. Therefore, it can be deduced that the PL may
not simply originate from the band to band transitions but the surface
states of nanosheets that can influence the luminescent transition
probability. It has been confirmed that the blue luminescence in β-Ga2O3 is attributed to the recombination of an electron
from a donor formed by oxygen vacancies and a hole from an acceptor
formed by gallium vacancies.35 The strong
emission peak of γ-Ga2O3 observed in Figure 7 was speculated to
be caused by oxygen vacancies and the much higher intensity of the
emission peak suggested a higher oxygen vacancy concentration,36 which was also demonstrated by the electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results shown in Figure S4. Obviously, γ-Ga2O3 exhibited
an obvious signal at g = 2.001, typical character
of oxygen vacancy, whereas no signal was observed in β-Ga2O3.

with UV fluorescent light excitation of 250 nm.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface measurements
were
carried out to further investigate the surface composition and chemical
states of Ga2O3 nanosheets, and the results
are shown in Figure 8. The survey XPS spectra, as presented in Figure 8a, illustrate the existence of two primary
elements: Ga and O. No obvious peaks for impurities were observed,
except the C 1s, which can be attributed to the adventitious hydrocarbon.
The C 1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as a reference to correct for specimen
charging. In the high-resolution Ga 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 8b), the peaks of Ga 2p1/2 and Ga 2p3/2 in the β-Ga2O3 nanosheets were located at around 1146.56 and 1119.68 eV,
respectively, which shift by 0.2 eV toward lower binding energy in
comparison with those in the γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets
(1146.77 and 1119.88 eV). These peaks are associated with the Ga–O
bonding in Ga2O3.37 The peaks of O 1s in β-Ga2O3 shown in Figure 8c are observed to
be located at 531.20, 532.09, and 533.58 eV, exhibiting a shift toward
lower binding energy compared with those peaks (531.37, 532.45, and
533.91 eV) of O 1s in γ-Ga2O3. These peaks
can be attributed to the lattice oxygen Ga–O, surface-bonded
OH groups attached to H2O molecules via hydrogen bonds,
and molecularly absorbed H2O, respectively.38 Obviously, the binding energies of Ga 2p in
the samples are not consistent with each other, indicating that the
chemical states of Ga atoms are different. The peaks in Ga 2p and
O 1s XPS in γ-Ga2O3 shift to a higher
binding energy, which may result from the formation of neighboring
oxygen vacancies showing a high electron-attracting effect.39 Thus, the γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets may possess higher oxygen vacancy concentrations compared
with β-Ga2O3. It has been reported that
compared with photogenerated holes, photogenerated electrons are preferentially
transferring to oxygen vacancies.40 Oxygen
vacancies can be the centers for capturing photogenerated electrons
in the photocatalytic reaction. Thus, it is speculated that the β-Ga2O3 nanosheets with lower oxygen vacancy concentrations
may possess less efficient separation and transportation of photogenerated
electron–hole pairs for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

XPS spectra: (a) survey XPS spectra scanned from
0 to 1200 eV and (b,c) high-resolution spectra of Ga 2p and O 1s.

The photoelectrochemical measurements
including transient photocurrent
response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were employed
to investigate the migration ability of the photogenerated carriers. Figure 9a shows the I–t curves of the samples under
the irradiation of 300 W Xe lamp. Compared with γ-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3 exhibits a decrease
in the transient photocurrent, indicating a lower photogenerated separation
and transportation rates of carriers in the β-Ga2O3 nanosheets. It is further demonstrated by the EIS Nyquist
plots performed in the dark, as shown in Figure 9b. The radius of β-Ga2O3 is significantly increased compared with that of γ-Ga2O3. The result is well consistent with the analysis
in PL and XPS.

spectroscopy of the samples in the dark.

It has been reported that the structure and surface properties
have great effects on the photocatalytic activity of the samples.41 Because the two kinds of Ga2O3 possess different structures and similar morphology, it would
be interesting to evaluate their photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic
performance of the samples is evaluated by the hydrogen evolution
from the water–methanol mixed solution. Figure 10a shows the photocatalytic activity of the
samples under the irradiation of UV light for H2 evolution
in 6 vol % methanol aqueous solution. The β-Ga2O3 nanosheets display a H2 evolution rate of 4.5
mmol·g–1·h–1, which
is two times lower than that of γ-Ga2O3 (10.0 mmol·g–1·h–1). The produced H2 increases steadily in proportion to
the irradiation time. After reaction for 450 min, the amount of H2 reaches to 11.3 mmol·g–1 for β-Ga2O3 and 25.0 mmol·g–1 for
γ-Ga2O3. Average apparent quantum yield
(AQY) was also calculated to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity
of the Ga2O3 samples. The number of incident
photons was calculated in the range of 250 nm (initial wavelength
of the UV light source) to the optical absorption edge of the samples
(280 nm for β-Ga2O3 and 264 nm for γ-Ga2O3). The AQY of β-Ga2O3 nanosheets was 0.29% in the range of 250–280 nm, whereas
the value of γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets was 1.82%
in the range of 250–264 nm. Obviously, the AQY of β-Ga2O3 nanosheets for H2 evolution is much
smaller than that of γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets.
It should be noted that the BET surface area of γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets (227.6 m2 g–1) is larger than that of β-Ga2O3 nanosheets
(73.7 m2 g–1). However, the enhancement
of AQY exceeds the effect of the difference in the specific surface
area for β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets. Therefore, the specific surface area is
not the key factor to determine the difference in the photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution activity between β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets. The more active
sites resulting from the unsaturated gallium atoms and higher separation
and transfer rates of photogenerated carriers of γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets, which were confirmed by XPS and transient
photocurrent response, were speculated to contribute to the higher
photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. The stability of the samples
during the photocatalytic process is of vital importance. As depicted
in Figure 10b,c, the
photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity remains unchanged after
three cycle runs.

Conclusions
In
summary, the 2D β-Ga2O3 nanosheets
were successfully fabricated from ultrathin 2D γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets through the one-step template synthesis.
The process of structure transition from cubic γ-Ga2O3 to monoclinic β-Ga2O3 did
not bring significant changes of the nanosheet morphology. Compared
with γ-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3 nanosheets exhibit a decreased photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
activity. The PL spectra, XPS surface measurements, and N2 adsorption–desorption curves indicate that the β-Ga2O3 nanosheets with less disordered structure possess
inefficient charge separation and transfer rates and lower specific
surface area than γ-Ga2O3, which decreased
the photocatalytic activity. Through the analysis of γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 nanosheets,
we proposed that our research may open promising prospects for the
development of sheet-like nanostructures through template approach
and bring more in-depth understanding of the effects of crystal structure
and morphology on the photocatalytic reaction.

Experimental Section
Preparation
of the Catalysts
Analytical grade commercial
gallium nitrate and ammonia solution were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, respectively, and were used
without further purification. The γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets were synthesized by the ammonolysis of the gallium nitrate.
In detail, 1 mmol gallium nitrate (0.2557 g) was simultaneously dropwise
added into 20 mL solution (containing 10 mL ammonia solution and 10
mL H2O) under magnetic stirring at room temperature. After
30 min, the suspension solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined
stainless-steel autoclave and maintaining the autoclave at 120 °C
for 10 h in an electric oven. After cooling to room temperature naturally,
the obtained sample was centrifuged and washed several times with
deionized water and then collected and dried at 80 °C for 12
h, giving the white power (γ-Ga2O3). The
γ-Ga2O3 nanosheets were converted to β-Ga2O3 by calcination at 700 °C for 3 h (with
a heating rate at 5 °C min–1) under air. After
the calcination process, the nanosheets were changed into smaller
and sharper ones.

Characterization
The crystalline
phases and structure
of the obtained Ga2O3 samples were characterized
by XRD on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with a
Cu Kα X-ray source (λ = 1.5406 Å). The Raman spectra
were collected using an inVia-Reflex micro-Raman spectroscopy system
(Renishaw Co.) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm at room temperature.
The size and morphology of the samples were observed by FE-SEM (JEOL
JSM-6701F and Nova NanoSEM 230) and TEM (Tecnai model G2 F20 S-TWIN
transmission electron microscope), respectively. The thickness of
the samples was evaluated by a tapping-mode AFM (NanoScope MultiMode
IIIa, Veeco Instruments) with a Si-tip cantilever. The N2 absorption–desorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics
apparatus model ASAP 2020. The UV–vis diffusion reflectance
spectroscopy was recorded at room temperature by a Cary 500 Scan spectrophotometer
with BaSO4 as a reflectance standard, and the room-temperature
PL spectra were performed on a FL/FS 920 TCSPC fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Edinburgh) with a pulsed xenon flash lamp excited at 250 nm. Electron
spin resonance was recorded over a Bruker ESP 300E EPR spectrometer.
XPS measurements were conducted on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system with
a monochromatic Al Kα source and a charge neutralizer. Photoelectrochemical
measurements were performed in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical
cell with a working electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and a saturated
Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. During the experiment,
the three electrodes were immersed in a sodium sulfate electrolyte
solution (0.2 M).

The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction
was carried out in a photoreaction vessel made of quartz connected
to a closed glass gas circulation system. The photocatalytic reaction
was performed in a dispersion of 20 mg of photocatalyst in 155 mL
of CH3OH solution (containing 145 mL of distilled water
and 10 mL of CH3OH). The system was evacuated using a mechanical
pump several times to completely remove the air. A 125 W high-pressure
mercury lamp was used as the light source for photocatalytic hydrogen
generation reaction. The reaction temperature of the photocatalytic
system was controlled at 5 °C by a continuous flow of cooling
water. The evolved gases were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph
(argon as the carrier gas), equipped with a thermal conductive detector.
The average AQY of the samples was measured under the same photocatalytic
reaction conditions. The incident light intensity of UV light source
was measured by SpectriLight ILT950, and the total number of incident
photons was measured using a calibrated silicon photodiode. The irradiance
spectrum of the high-voltage mercury lamp with 125 W has been added
in the Supporting Information (Figure S5).
The AQY of H2 evolution over the Ga2O3 nanosheets was calculated according to the following equations:
