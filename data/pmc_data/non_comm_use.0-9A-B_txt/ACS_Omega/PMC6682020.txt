and [Cd2(HL)(btc)(H2O)2]·3H2O (5), were prepared
by reactions of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O with 1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)-4-(4H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzene (H2L) or mixed carboxylate ancillary
ligands of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2obda), 5-hydroxy-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic
acid (H2ohmbda), and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3btc), respectively. Their structures have been characterized
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, infrared
spectroscopy (IR), thermogravimetric analysis, and powder X-ray diffraction.

frameworks without consideration of the solvent molecules. Complex 1 exhibits a binodal (3, 5)-connected two-dimensional (2D)
layer structure with the point (Schläfli) symbol of (52·6)(55·64·7), while complex 2 shows a 2D + 2D → 3D (three-dimensional) framework.
Complex 3 is a (3, 5, 6)-connected tetranodal 3D net
with the point (Schläfli) symbol of (4·82)2(45·6·84)2(45·65)2(48·66·8). Compound 4 is a (3, 3, 8)-connected
trinodal 3D net with the point (Schläfli) symbol based on a
binuclear [Cd2N2O] subunit, while 5 is a 2-nodal (3, 4)-connected 2D V2O5-type
network based on [Cd2N2(COO)2] SBU.
The studies of molecular sensing properties show that the luminescent
MOFs can be employed as fluorescent sensors for the detection of Fe3+ and nitro compounds. Compound 1 and 3 exhibit quenching responses for Fe3+ in dimethylformamide
solution with detection limits of 2.3 × 10–6 and 8.6 × 10–7 M, respectively. Meanwhile,
compound 5 can sense 4-nitrophenol with a detection limit
as low as 5.75 × 10–7 M.

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have aroused enormous interest
in the field of crystal engineering because of their fascinating structures
and potential applications such as gas storage and separation,1−4 catalysis,5,6 luminescence, and sensing.7−12 Structurally, MOFs are infinite structures constructed from organic
ligands and metal ions/clusters connected via coordination interactions.
Therefore, the functionalities of MOFs are mainly attributable to
the nature of the organic ligands and metal centers.13,14 For example, the luminescent MOFs consisting of π-conjugated
organic ligands and d10 metal centers possess excellent
luminescence emission properties and have received particular attention
as chemical sensors for sensing nitroaromatic compounds and heavy-metal
ions because of their high selectivity and sensitivity, quick response,
and recoverability.15−21 For example, the Wang group synthesized the complex {[Tb(L)1.5(H2O)]·DMA·4H2O}n [N-heterocyclic dicarboxylic (2-pyrimidin-5-yl) terephthalic acid
(H2L) ligand], which can sense Fe3+ as low as
7.13 × 10–5 M.22 Similarly, the crystalline product of [Cd(L2)0.5(bipy)]
shows highly selective sensing property for Fe3+ ions.23 As for the organic ligands, both of the nitrogen-rich
ligands and carboxylic acids are most effective building units for
the assembly of various MOFs because the multi-N and -O coordination
atoms are easily apt to link with metal centers.24−27 Particularly, the polyazaheteroaromatic
ligands can exhibit flexible coordination modes to build diverse MOFs.28−33 In our previous study, we have deliberately designated multi-N-donor
ligands containing 1H-imidazol-4-yl groups to construct
a series of porous frameworks exhibiting favorable gas adsorption
properties because of the increasing interaction between the adsorbate
and uncoordinated N binding sites as elaborately elucidated by Grand
Canonical Monte Carlo simulation calculations.34−36 Besides the
polyazaheteroaromatic ligands, carboxylic acid ligands are another
kind of building units for constructing MOFs due to the variable coordination
modes for the carboxyl group.37−42 Furthermore, the mixed polyazaheteroaromatic ligands and carboxylic
acid ligands have favorable compatibility, benefiting to construct
diverse MOFs.43 Using the mixed ligands
strategy including polyazaheteroaromatic and carboxylic acids ligands,
a series of MOFs with novel structures have been constructed based
on 4-imidazolyl ligands and auxiliary carboxylic acid ligands together
with varied metal salts.44−46 In this paper, we focus our attention
on the study of reactions of the π-conjugated 1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)-4-(4H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzene (H2L) ligand together with varied carboxylate ligands to react
with metal Cd(II) salts and obtain a series of Cd(II) complexes. Photoluminescence
and molecular sensing properties were investigated.

Results and Discussion
Crystal
Structure of [Cd(HL)2] (1)
Complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic form with P21 space group (Table 1) and one Cd(II) atom, two kinds of partially
deprotonated HL– ligands are included in the asymmetric
unit. Figure 1A shows
the central Cd(II) atom with distorted square-pyramidal coordination
geometry is five-coordinated by five N atoms from five individual
HL– ligands. The H2L ligand is deprotonated
to give HL– ligands with variable coordination modes,
as shown in Scheme 1 (I and II). Two kinds of deprotonated HL– anions
act as μ2 or μ3 bridge to connect
two or three Cd(II) atoms and balance the charges of the framework,
respectively. Particularly, a kind of HL– ligand
employs μ3 bridge to link Cd(II) atoms to form a
two-dimensional (2D) [Cd(HL)−]+ network
in the ab plane, while the other HL– acts as linear
two-connector to link two adjacent Cd(II) atoms up and down the [Cd(HL)−]+ 2D layer, forming the [Cd(HL)22–] double layer (Figure 1B). Topologically, two kinds of HL– ligands link two or three Cd(II) atoms, in turn, being treated as
2- and 3-connected nodes, respectively. Cd1 can be regarded as a 5-connector
because it links five HL– ligands. Topological analysis
calculated by the TOPOS program47 suggests
that 1 is a binodal (3, 5)-connected 2D net with a point
(Schläfli) symbol of (52·6)(55·64.7) (Figure 1C). Furthermore, the adjacent 2D layers are linked together by N–H···O
and C–H···O hydrogen bonds to generate a three-dimensional
(3D) structure (Figure 1D and Table S2).

Crystal Structure
of [Cd(HL)2(H2O)2] (2)
When the reaction solution of 1 was instead
of N,N′-dimethylacetamide–H2O mixed solution, a new supramolecular isomeric framework
of 2 was isolated. Complex 2 crystallizes
in the orthorhombic Ibam space group (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of 2 contains
a Cd(II) atom with a quarter of occupancy, a half of deprotonated
HL– ligand, and a half of coordinated water molecule.
The Cd(II) center is located at an inversion center with an [CdN4O2] octahedral coordination environment by four
nitrogen and two oxygen atoms from four HL– anions
and two terminal water ligands (Figure 2A). Four deprotonated HL– anions
connect four Cd(II) ions to afford a [Cd4(HL)4–] square unit (Figure 2B), where the lateral Cd···Cd
distances are 14.33 and 14.36 Å. In 2, each HL– act as a linear connector to link two Cd(II) ions
to form a 44-sql net along the bc plane
(Figure 2B). The large
rectangular windows lead to mutually inclined interpenetration with
another layer with an angle of 63.41° (Figure 2C), forming a 2D + 2D → 3D inclined
polycatenation architecture (Figure 2D).48,49

interpenetrating packing diagram. (D) Schematic illustration of 2D
+ 2D → 3D mutual inclined interpenetration in 2.

Crystal Structure of [Cd3(HL)2(obda)2] (3)
When ancillary ligand 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic
acid was added to the reaction system of 2, a different
complex 3 was isolated. Compound 3 crystallizes
in the triclinic space group Pi̅, and the asymmetric
unit consists of one and a half of Cd(II) atoms, one partially deprotonated
HL– ligand, and one obda2– ligand. Figure 3A shows that Cd1
has an octahedral coordination environment and four O atoms from four
different obda2– ligands form the basal plane, while
two N atoms from two individual HL– anions occupy
the apical positions. The seven-coordinated Cd2 atom is surrounded
by two N atoms (N2C, N5) from two different HL– ligands,
five O atoms (O1, O3, O1A, O3B, and O4B) from four carboxylate groups
of three obda2– ligands (Figure 3A). The Cd–O distances range from
2.292(2) to 2.583(3) Å, Cd–N distances are in the range
of 2.225(3)–2.301(3) Å, and the coordination angles around
Cd centers vary from 50.55(7) to 180.00(12)° (Table S1). Each obda2– in 3 acts as a μ5 bridge to link five Cd(II) atoms adopting
μ3-η1:η2 bridge
and μ3-η2:η2 bridge
coordination modes. When the connections via HL– are ignored, the Cd(II) atoms are linked through the obda2– ligands to form a 2D [Cd3(obda)2]2+ layer (Figure 3B).
The just ignored HL– ligands that link three Cd(II)
atoms between adjacent 2D layers to form a pillar-layered 3D structure
(Figure 3C). Topologically,
each 3-connected HL– ligand can be treated as a
linear 3-connector, while each obda2– ligand links
five Cd(II) atoms and can be regarded as a 5-connector. Each Cd1 is
a 6-connected node because it links two HL– ligands
and four Cd(II) atoms, while Cd2 is 5-connected node since it links
two HL– and three obda2– ligands.
Therefore, the overall structure of 3 is a (3, 5, 6)-connected
tetranodal 3D net with stoichiometry (3-c)2(5-c)4(6-c) (Figure 3D)
with the point (Schläfli) symbol of (4·82)2(45·6·84)2(45·65)2(48·66·8).

Crystal Structure of [Cd2(HL)2(ohmbda)(DMA)(H2O)] (4)
When the auxiliary ligand of
H2obda in 3 was changed to H2ohmbda,
a new compound 4 was obtained. There are two unique Cd(II)
atoms, two different HL– ligands, half of the complete
deprotonated ohmbda2– ligand, and one μ2-bridge water molecule in the asymmetric unit. Both Cd(II)
atoms have the same distorted octahedral coordination geometry with
a N4O2 coordination sphere (Figure 4A). Different from the complexes 1–3, two different HL– ligands have the same coordination modes, serving as 4-connector
to ligate four Cd(II) atoms. The tetrazole fragment from the HL– ligand utilizes the positions of 1, 2, 4-N atoms in
μ3-N1, N3, N4 and link three Cd(II) atoms (type V, Scheme 1), while another
imidazole group links one Cd(II) atom. In this sense, one kind of
HL– ligands (labeled as N1, N2) act as 4-connector
to link Cd(II) atoms, forming a 2D network (Figure 4B). Meanwhile, each ohmbda2– ligand acts as a μ2-bridge to connect adjacent
two Cd(II) atoms up and down the 2D layer. In the 2D layer, two Cd(II)
atoms together with the two tetrazole fragments from the HL– ligand and a μ2-bridge water molecule form a binuclear
[Cd2N4O] subunit with a Cd···Cd
distance of 3.88 Å. On the other hand, the other kind of HL– ligands pillar the Cd(II) atoms from the adjacent
2D network to form a 3D structure (Figure 4C). Therefore, the 3D framework of [Cd2(HL)2(ohmbda)(H2O)] is a layered-pillared
net, where the layer is a [Cd2(H2O)(ohmbda2–)(HL–)2]+ sheet
and the pillar is HL– ligands (Figure 4D). Topologically, both of
the different HL– ligands are neighbored by three
binuclear [Cd2N4O] subunits, which can be viewed
as a 3-connector (Figure S1). Meanwhile,
each binuclear [Cd2N2O] subunit is an 8-connected
node because it ligates six HL– ligands and two
[Cd2N4O] subunit SBUs (Figure S1). Thus, 4 is a (3, 8)-connected 3D network
with the point (Schläfli) symbol of (4·52)(42·5)(43·510·68·74·83).

Crystal Structure of [Cd2(HL)(btc)(H2O)2]·3H2O (5)
When the
auxiliary ligand was changed to 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, compound 5 was obtained. The asymmetric unit contains two unique Cd(II)
atoms, one HL–, one btc3– ligand,
and two coordinate and three lattice water molecules. Cd1 is six-coordinated
by five O atoms from three btc3– ligands, one N
atom from one HL– ligand (Figure 5A), and one water molecule, forming a distorted
octahedral coordination geometry, while Cd2 is a distorted square-pyramidal
coordination geometry with a N2O3 donor set.
The HL– ligand adopts μ2-N1, N2
of the tetrazole group and the N1 position of the 4-imidazole group
to coordinate with the Cd(II) atom (type VI, Scheme 1). Each btc3– in 5 serves as a μ4-bridge to link four Cd(II)
atoms in μ1-η1:η1-chelating, μ2-η1:η1-bridging coordination modes for the three carboxylate groups, respectively.
Particularly, two Cd(II) atoms are bridged by two carboxylate groups
from two btc3– to form a binuclear [Cd2N2(COO)2] SBU, which are extended by HL– and btc3– ligands to form a 2D layer
structure (Figure 5B). Topologically, the [Cd2N2(COO)2] SBU and each HL– ligand can be regarded as a
4- or 3-connector in the 2D layer (Figure S2). In this connect, the 2D framework is a (3, 4)-connected V2O5 net of (42·63·8)(42·6) symbol (Figure 5C).50 Between the 2D layers,
there exist rich hydrogen bonds (Figure 5D). Particularly, the adjacent 2D layers
also have π–π stacking interactions with the centroid–centroid
distance of 3.85 Å between aromatic nuclei of L ligands (Figure 5D). Therefore, 5 is a 3D supramolecular polymer built from hydrogen bonds
and π–π stacking interactions.

Synthesis and Coordination Modes of the H2L Ligand
The compounds 1–5 were successfully
synthesized, and the study further demonstrated that mixed ligands
are effective building units to assemble MOFs. Particularly, for ligand
H2L, a polydentate nitrogen-containing ligand, the tetrazolyl
and 4-imidazolyl groups can be deprotonated to be a polyazaheteroaromatic
anion, displaying rich coordination sites and multiform possible conformations.51 In 1–5, all
of the H2L ligands are deprotonated to be HL– because the tetrazolyl fragment is more easily deprotonated than
the other 4-imidazolyl group. Meanwhile, 4-imidazolyl groups of H2L can also utilize differently positioned nitrogen atoms of
imidazolyl groups to link with metal atoms (type II, Scheme 1). The diverse coordination
modes for the H2L ligand in complexes 1–5 are illustrated in Scheme 1: types I and II in 1, type III in 2; type IV in 3, type V in 4, and
type VI in 5. On the other hand, the important families
of multidentate O-donor polycarboxylate ancillary ligands of H2obda, H2ohmbda, and H3btc employed in
this study are excellent structural constructors because they can
control and adjust the structures of coordination polymers in a mixed-ligand
system. The carboxylic groups exhibit flexible coordination modes,
showing μ3-η1:η2-bridge and μ3-η2:η2-bridge in obda2–, μ1-η1:η0-monodentate in ohmbda2–, and μ1-η1:η1-chelating and μ2-η1:η1-bridging in btc3–. The carboxylate ligands
play an important role in generating multidimensional networks and
interesting topologies as shown in complexes 1–5.

Thermal Stabilities and Powder X-ray Diffraction
(PXRD) of the
Complexes
The thermal stability of the compounds was evaluate
by thermogravimetric analyses (Figure S3). For 1, the framework can be stable up to 380 °C,
following the collapse. Complex 2 loses a weight loss
of 6.19% (calc. 6.31%) with the release of water molecules from 110
to 155 °C and collapses at 295 °C. Weight loss was not found
for 3 till it collapsed around 355 °C. Complex 4 exhibited a weight loss of 2.30% (calc. 2.15%) at the temperature
ranging from 65 to 105 °C and then displayed a narrow thermogravimetric
platform, immediately accompanied with the collapse of the framework,
which is consistent with the departure of bridging water molecules.
A total weight loss of 12.14% (calc. 12.45%) belongs to the departure
of water molecules for 5 in the temperature range of
75–205°, until the residue collapses at 365 °C. The
pure phases of the synthesized 1–5 complexes were confirmed by PXRD measurements (Figure S4).

Diffuse Reflectance Spectra
The
UV–vis spectra
for the as-synthesized samples of 1–5 were recorded and applied to calculate the band gap, Eg.52 The H2L ligand exhibits
one strong absorption bands centered at 308 nm, which can be attributable
to n → π* or π → π* transitions. Compounds 1–5 exhibit similar broad bands in the
range from 200 to 353 nm in the ultraviolet region, which are dominated
by the absorption of H2L ligands. The optical band gaps
obtained according to the steep absorption edge are estimated as 3.34,
3.51, 3.13, 3.48, and 3.26 eV for complexes 1–5 (Figure 6), respectively, indicating the existence of optical direct band
gap and the characteristic of semiconductivity, which may make them
potential wide gap semiconductor materials.53,54

Photoluminescence Properties
Coordination polymers
constructed from closed-shell d10 metal centers and the
organic ligand with a delocalized π-system exhibit photoluminescence
and have potential applications owing to their ability to adjust the
emission of the hybrids.55,56 Therefore, the design
and synthesis of compounds containing d10 Cd(II) metal
centers have been carried out in this study. Accordingly, luminescence
emission spectra of 1–5 were measured,
and the results are exhibited in Figure 7. The organic ligand H2L exhibits
intense emission at 440 nm upon excitation at 365 nm, which belongs
to the π → π* electron transition, due to its delocalization
(Figure S5). In comparison to those of
the conjugated organic ligand, the emission bands resulting from the
π* → n transition for the solid-state carboxylate ligands
are usually weak and have no contribution to the fluorescence emission.57 Emission bands were observed at 428 nm (λex = 362 nm) for 1, 440 nm (λex = 365 nm) for 2, 435 nm (λex = 362
nm) for 3, 386 nm (λex = 329 nm) for 5, and very low fluorescence emission at 424 nm (λex = 375 nm) for 4. The emission bands for complexes 1 and 3–5 are blue-shifted
by 12, 5, 16, and 54 nm, respectively, with respect to that of the
H2L and can be tentatively assigned to intraligand fluorescence
due to their fluorescence similarity.58,59 The study
of corresponding quantum yield (QY) and decay lifetimes was carried
out to further study the luminescence properties of compounds 1–3 and 5 (Figure S6). The QY values of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 5 are 1.13, 0.74, 1.54,
and 0.7%, respectively. In addition, the luminescence lifetimes of
compounds 1–3 and 5 are
calculated to be 50, 2, 2, and 1 ns, respectively, that arise from
a singlet state, much shorter than the ones resulting from a triplet
state (>10–3 s).60,61

Sensing of Small Organic Molecules
It is known that
a considerable amount of fluorescent MOF materials may be sensitive
to the presence of guest molecules.62,63 As mentioned
above, the compounds 1, 3, and 5 exhibit more intense fluorescence intensity in contrast to that
of 2 and 4 under the same conditions. Therefore,
the luminescent MOFs of 1, 3, and 5 were selected to study their molecular sensing properties.
To examine whether 1, 3, and 5 have abilities to detect small solvent molecules, the finely ground
samples of complexes 1, 3, and 5 (5 mg) were dispersed in different solvents (10 mL), respectively,
namely, dimethylformamide (DMF), DEF, dimethylamine (DMA), methanol
(MeOH), toluene, ethanol (EtOH), acetonitrile (CH3CN),
ether (Et2O), acetone, and nitrobenzene (NB), and then
ultrasonically shake for about 30 min. It was found that complexes 1, 3, and 5 are sensitive to the
solvent molecules to a some extent as evidenced by the fluorescence
intensity (Figures S7–S9). The photoluminescence
intensity depends on the identity of the solvent molecules with sequence
of DEF > DMA > MeOH > EtOH > DMF > CH3CN
> acetone > Et2O > toluene > pure NB for 1 (Figure S7), DEF > DMF >
DMA > EtOH > toluene > MeOH > CH3CN > acetone
> Et2O > pure NB for 3 (Figure S8), and DMA > DMF > DEF > MeOH
> EtOH > CH3CN > acetone > toluene > Et2O >
pure NB for 5 (Figure S9).
Through a series of fluorescence measurements, it can be found that
all of the fluorescent MOF materials dispersed in dipole solvents
as DMA, DMF, and DEF show the highest luminescence intensity due to
their strong dipole moment.63,64 Meanwhile, the polar
solvents (MeOH, EtOH) exhibit a relative strong luminescence intensity
in contrast to their low fluorescence quenching for the nonpolar solvents
(acetone, Et2O). The above phenomenon can be attributed
to the interaction between the dispersible skeleton and solvent molecules
having different polarities, such as hydrogen bonding, π–π
stacking, and electrostatic interaction.65,66

It should be noted that the complexes of 1, 3, and 5 all show complete luminescence intensity
quenching for nitrobenzene. Checking the possibility for sensing other
nitroaromatic compounds (NACs), including NB, o-nitrophenol
(2-NP), m-nitrophenol (3-NP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), o-dinitrobenzene (1,2-DNB), m-dinitrobenzene
(1,3-DNB), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, and Octo (HMX), was inspired by
the quenching behavior of NB. The fluorescence intensity of different
complexes was measured by formulating 1 mmol L–1 DMF solution. The aromatic NACs have great quenching effect on the
complexes of 1, 3, and 5 except
the aliphatic HMX (Figures 8 and S10 and S11), which can be
evaluated by the equation (QP) = (I0 – I)/I0 × 100%67 to estimate the quenching percentage (QP), in
which I0 and I are the
fluorescent intensities of the luminescent MOFs dispersed in DMF solution
without and with the addition of the analyte, respectively. Particularly,
nitrophenol has a strong quenching effect on complex 5 (Figure 8). Particularly,
the most effective quenchers is 4-NP with quenching percentage of
99.75%, far more than those of other nitro compounds. The high quenching
efficiency of 4-NP has prompted us to further study the sensitivity
of luminescence quenching by fluorescence titration. Apparently, the
luminescence intensity of 4-NP-incorporated 5 is dependent
on the concentration of 4-NP. As shown in Figure 9, nearly 100% of the emission intensity was
decreased when 4-NP concentration increased from 0 to 700 μL
for 5. The quantified value of the quenching effect of
4-NP was obtained using the Stern–Volmer equation: I0/I = 1 + KSV[M],68 in which [M] is the
molar concentration of the analyte and I0 and I are the luminescence intensities of 5 dispersed in DMF suspension without and with the addition
of 4-NP, respectively. It has a good linear relationship at a low
concentration, and the quenching coefficient is KSV = 2.69 × 104 (Figure 9b), almost equal to the value of the reported
luminescent MOF [Zn5(DpImDC)2(DMF)4(H2O)3]·H2O·DMF.69 In addition, the detection limit (3σ/KSV) of 4-NP was deduced to be 5.75 × 10–7 M (Figure S12), which
is comparable to that of the reported MOFs for sensing 4-NP,70 calculated from the equation 3σ/k (σ, standard error; KSV, slope).71 Thus, 5 can be
considered as a potential candidate for the selective sensing of 4-NP
molecules.

different nitro compounds.

concentrations of 4-NP. (b) Stern–Volmer plot of 5 for 4-NP at a low concentration.

Furthermore, the repeatability of 5 for sensing
4-NP
was also examined. The samples were reused to sense 4-NP, remarkably,
and it was found the initial fluorescence intensity was almost regained
even after five cycles, suggesting a high reversibility of 5 for potential applications (Figure 10). The PXRD patterns of the recovered sample after
five cycles of quenching and recovery also are consistent with those
of the as-synthesized samples, indicating high stability of the framework
(Figure S4).

test of 5; the upper dots
represent the initial luminescence intensity, and the lower dots represent
the intensity upon addition of 1 mM DMF solution of 4-NP.

High sensitivity for sensing 4-NP prompted us to
make further investigate
the quenching mechanism. Generally, fluorescence quenching mainly
depends on the fact that the excited electrons of the fluorescent
material are transferred to the electron-deficient analytes, instead
of relaxation to the ground state, which may appear as an effective
overlap between the UV/vis absorption spectra of analytes and the
emission spectra of fluorescent MOFs. As shown in Figure 11, the effective overlap of
UV and fluorescence is almost the same, which further verifies that
the fluorescence quenching mechanism is an energy transfer mechanism.72,73

analytes and the emission spectrum of 5.

Sensing of Fe3+ Ion
Based
on the study of
the fluorescence sensing effects of organic molecules, the investigation
of the ion recognition mechanism based on DMF solutions of different
metal ions has attracted our attention to better understand the fluorescence
sensing properties of the complexes. Disperse 5 mg of samples 1, 3, and 5 in 10 mL of DMF solution
containing the same concentration of M(NO3)n (1 mM, M = K+, Al3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Ag+) and then sonicate the
mixture for 30 min, respectively. Figure 12 shows that the Fe3+ solution
makes the most significant fluorescence quenching effect for the emulsions
of 1 and 3 compared to most other ions,
while other cations show different changes in fluorescence intensity,
as shown in Figure 13; upon Fe3+ addition, the fluorescence intensity of the
suspensions of complexes 1 and 3 gradually
decreased.

Figure 13 Fluorescence intensity curves of complexes 1 (a) and 3 (b) in different concentrations of
Fe3+ in DMF
and linear curves showing fluorescence quenching at low concentrations.

Taking their high fluorescence
quenching effect on Fe3+ ions into account, the Stern–Volmer
equation was also employed
to investigate the sensitivity to Fe3+ ions for the complexes
of 1 and 3. The linear Stern–Volmer
curves for complexes 1 and 3 in Fe3+ solution fit the exponential equation well and also give values
for low concentrations of KSV (KSV1 = 1.22 × 104, KSV3 = 1.60 × 104), equivalent to the complexes
[Cd(L1)(oba)]·DMF and [Zn2(L1)2(HBPT)2]·H2O [L1 = 1,3-di(1H-imidazol-4- yl)benzene, H2oba = 4,4′-oxybis-(benzoic acid), H3BPT = biphenyl-3,4′,5-tricarboxylic
acid] with 2.69 × 104 and 3.38 × 104 M–1, respectively (Figure 13).74 According
to the slope and standard error of the fitting lines, the detection
limits are calculated to be 2.3 × 10–6 M for 1 and 8.6 × 10–7 M for 3 based on the equation 3σ/k (Figures S13 and S14), indicating higher sensitivity than those
of the reported MOFs.75−77 In addition, to test the influence of recognition
in the case of other ion interferences, in the presence of other ions,
Fe3+ is added to measure the fluorescence intensity before
comparison with other ions. As shown in Figure 14, 1 and 3 have
high selectivity for the detection of Fe3+ ion because
no intensity change was observed in the case of other metal ions.
Moreover, the multiple cycles of the Fe3+ sensing experiments
were performed and the obtained results showed that the material could
greatly regain its intensity after being washed with DMF several times
(Figures S15 and S16). The result also
reveals that 1 and 3 can be employed as
fluorescent sensors for detecting Fe3+ with high sensitivity
and recyclability.

Figure 14 Bar graph of anti-interference performance of Fe3+ in
different metal ion solutions of complexes 1 (a) and 3 (b).

Thus, compounds 1 and 3 can be regarded
as potential candidates for selective sensing of the Fe3+ ion. Such fluorescence quenching attributes to maximum spectral
overlap between the UV–vis wide absorption spectrum at around
300 nm of the Fe3+ ion solution and the excitation spectra
of 1 and 3 (Figure S17). The wide absorption of Fe3+ may hinder the absorption
of 1 and 3 upon excitation and lead to the
decrease or quenching of the fluorescence.78,79

Conclusions
Five Cd(II) coordination
polymers with diverse structures were
obtained by hydrothermal methods based on multi-N-donor ligands with
a delocalized π-system or mixed carboxylates. The results further
demonstrate that the multi-N-donor H2L ligand can exhibit
diverse coordination modes, while carboxylate ligands possess supercompatibility
to build coordination frameworks as auxiliary ligands. The MOFs constructed
from closed-shell d10 Cd(II) centers and the H2L organic ligand with a delocalized π-system have favorable
photoluminescence properties, which could serve as fluorescent sensors
for the detection of Fe3+ and nitro compounds with high
sensitivity, selectivity, and recyclability. The luminescent materials
exhibit the clear “turn-off” quenching responses for
Fe3+ in DMF solution with high selectivity and sensitivity
of 2.3 × 10–6 M for 1 and 8.6
× 10–7 M for 3. Meanwhile, compound 5 can sense the 4-nitrophenol with a detection limit as low
as 5.75 × 10–7 M. In this context, this study
provides an easy and facile route to design and yield new luminescent
MOFs as promising luminescent sensors.
