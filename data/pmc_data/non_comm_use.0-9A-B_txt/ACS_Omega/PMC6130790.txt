Spiramycin is a macrolide
antibiotic and antiparasitic that is
used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues.
In the current study, we evaluated the effects of α-cyclodextrin,
β-cyclodextrin, or methyl-β-cyclodextrin supplementation
to a synthetic culture medium on biomass and spiramycin production
by Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 23877.
We found a high stimulatory effect on spiramycin production when the
culture medium was supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) methyl-β-cyclodextrin,
whereas α-cyclodextrin or β-cyclodextrin weakly enhanced
antibiotic yields. As the stimulation of antibiotic production could
be because of spiramycin complexation with cyclodextrins with effects
on antibiotic stability and/or efflux, we analyzed the possible formation
of complexes by physical–chemical methods. The results of Job
plot experiment highlighted the formation of a nonhost@guest complex
methyl-β-cyclodextrin@spiramycin I in the stoichiometric ratio
of 3:1 while they excluded the formation of complex between spiramycin
I and α- or β-cyclodextrin. Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy measurements were then carried out to characterize the
methyl-β-cyclodextrin@spiramycin I complex and individuate the
chemical groups involved in the binding mechanism. These findings
may help to improve the spiramycin fermentation process, providing
at the same time a new device for better delivery of the antibiotic
at the site of infection by methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexation,
as it has been well-documented for other bioactive molecules.

Introduction
Spiramycin is a macrolide
antibiotic and antiparasitic that is
used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues.1,2 It is produced by the mycelial actinomycete Streptomyces
ambofaciens, a prolific producer of bioactive molecules.
Besides spiramycin, the reference strain S. ambofaciens ATCC 23877,3 whose genome sequence has
been recently delivered,4 has been known
for the past 60 years to produce congocidine (netropsin), a pyrrolamide
with a broad range of biological activities but no medical applications.5 More recently, a genome mining-guided approach
has revealed the ability of this strain to produce, in addition to
these two compounds, the antibiotic kinamycins, the siderophores coelichelin
and desferioxamines, the antifungal antimycin and stambomycins, and
novel polyketides with antibacterial and antiproliferative activities.6

The molecular structure of spiramycin consists
of a 16-membered
lactone ring that is decorated by two amino sugars (mycaminose and
forosamine) and one neutral sugar (mycarose). The 16-membered lactone
ring is synthesized by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) that, apart
from the most common polyketide precursors, malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA,
is predicted to incorporate the less common precursor, ethylmalonyl-CoA,
and the functionalized extender unit, methoxymalonyl-CoA.7,8S. ambofaciens ATCC 23877 produces
three components forming the “spiramycin complex”, namely,
spiramycin I, which has a hydroxyl group at the C-3 of aglycone, spiramycin
II, in which the hydroxyl group is acetylated, and spiramycin III,
in which the same position is propionylated.9

Over the past 40 years, a variety of approaches have been
described
in the literature for improving the industrial production of this
natural compound. In addition to the traditional mutate-and-screen
method10,11 and process improvement,12−16 rational selection (2-deoxy-glucose, valine, and
soybean oil-resistant mutants, mutants resistant to high concentrations
of spiramycin, etc.),17,18 genetic modification of metabolic
genes,19,20 and pleiotropic21 and pathway-specific regulators22 have
been reported. Recently, an integrated approach to identify metabolic
targets for antibiotics overproduction by systems biology has been
described.23 Regarding process improvement,
the effects of glucose,15,16 glycerol,14 inorganic phosphate,15 ammonium ions,13 and short-chain fatty
acids12 on the production of spiramycin
have been reported.

Here, we evaluated the effects of cyclodextrin
supplementation
to a culture medium on the biomass and spiramycin production by S. ambofaciens ATCC 23877. Cyclodextrins are a family
of macrocyclic oligosaccharides linked by α-1,4 glycosidic bonds
to form a cone-shaped structure with a hydrophobic cavity.24,25 Natural cyclodextrins are α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin,
and γ-cyclodextrin, composed, respectively, of six, seven, and
eight units of d-glucopyranose. These cyclic oligosaccharides
can form different complexes with compounds: host@guest, which can
be inserted into their cavity leading to an increased solubility and
consequently to a higher biological activity,24,25 and nonhost@guest. In the latter case, the interaction occurs with
the external surface and big/small borders of cyclodextrins. Some
examples of host@guest complexes involving β-cyclodexstrins
are those formed with ofloxacin,26 butylparaben,
and triclosan.27 Among nonhost@guest complexes,
those formed between erythromycin and β-cyclodextrin have been
well-characterized.28 Complexation with
cyclodextrins has been proposed as a drug delivery system,29 in addition to other applications. For instance,
cyclodextrins can be exploited by imprinted magnetic nanoparticles
for the recovery and separation of erythromycin from industrial wastewater.28 A further industrial application of cyclodextrins
is the improvement of secondary metabolites production. For example,
in different Mycobacterium strains,
hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin increased the bioconversion of
phytosterol by a factor of 2.30

Results
and Discussion
Effects of Cyclodextrins on Mycelial Growth
and Spiramycin Production
The primary goal of the present
study was to evaluate the possibility
of improving spiramycin production by manipulating the fermentation
microenvironment by means of cyclodextrins. The effects of cyclodextrins
on the mycelial growth and spiramycin production by S. ambofaciens ATCC 23877 were evaluated in shake-flask
batch cultivation using the minimal basal medium (MBM) medium containing
25 mM l-valine and 40 g/L glucose. To this purpose, the bacteria
were cultivated for 24 h. Then, the broth cultures were supplemented
with 0.5% (w/v) α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin,
or potato dextrin. α-Cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, or
potato dextrin did not elicit any significant effect on the spiramycin
production at 72 h (RG1-T phase), 120 h (RG2 phase), and 168 h (stationary
phase) (data not shown). In contrast, methyl-β-cyclodextrin
stimulated total spiramycin titers by a factor of 1.96, 2.66, and
3.26 at 72, 120, and 168 h, respectively (Figure 1A,B). The increase was statistically significant
at 120 h (p-value < 0.05) and 168 h (p-value < 0.005). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin also produced clear
effects on the growth curve. The most noticeable one consisted of
a growth slowdown during rapid growth phase 1 (RG1) and rapid growth
phase 2 (RG2) and about 25% lower final biomass values.

methyl-β-cyclodextrin on the mycelial growth and
spiramycin production by S. ambofaciens. The effects of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) on the
biomass (A) and total spiramycin production (B) were evaluated during S. ambofaciens growth in the MBM medium containing
25 mM l-valine and 40 g/L glucose. Values indicate mean values
± SD (bars) from quintuplicate experiments. (C). Radar plots
showing the percentage ratios between spiramycin I, II, and III produced
by S. ambofaciens either in the absence
(left) or in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin at 72, 120,
and 168 h. Spiramycin production was then evaluated by LC-MS.

Spiramycin is produced by S. ambofaciens ATCC 23877 as a complex formed by
three major components (I, II,
and III), which differ in the substituent at position 3 (−H,
−CO–CH3, and −CO–CH2–CH3, respectively) of the lactone nucleus. The
quantitative analysis of these components by liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed that in the absence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin,
the percentage ratios between spiramycin I, II, and III at 72, 120,
and 168 h were, respectively, 65:10:25, 67:9:24, and 70:9:21 (Figure 1C). The addition
of methyl-β-cyclodextrin to the broth cultures affected the
ratios of these components by increasing the relative amounts of spiramycin
I with respect to spiramycin II and III. Under these conditions, the
percentage ratios between spiramycin I, II, and III at 72, 120, and
168 h were, respectively, 86:4:10, 83:5:12, and 84:5:11 (Figure 1C). The higher percentage
ratios of spiramycin I recovery with respect to spiramycin II and
III are of practical interest, as spiramycin I is the component of
the “spiramycin complex” that is mostly used for human
therapy. This finding is consistent with the study by Patzelt and
colleagues31 on polyether antibiotics monensin
A in Streptomyces cinnamonensis A3823.5
and nigericin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus V1327 and Streptomyces violaceusniger NRRL B-1865, who demonstrated a clear stimulatory effect of heptakis-2,6-di-O-methyl β-cyclodextrin (DMCD) on the production of
these compounds in shaken liquid cultures. Noticeably, they hypothesized
a similar stimulatory effect on the biosynthesis of other related
antibiotics including macrolides and polyenes.31

On a mechanistic point of view, as methyl-β-cyclodextrin
does not go through the bacterial cell membrane, there could be two
possible and not mutually exclusive mechanisms to interpret its stimulatory
effect on spiramycin production. One mechanism could be an indirect
effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin on spiramycin biosynthesis due
to perturbation of membrane fatty acid metabolism, as suggested by
Patzelt and colleagues for polyether antibiotics.31 Indeed, they noticed that in Mycobacterium
phlei, DMCD was able to stimulate fatty acid biosynthesis
catalyzed by fatty acid synthase,32 possibly
because of the ability of cyclodextrins to bind the hydrophobic portion
of palmitoyl-CoA.33 On the basis of the
analogy between fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis, they suggested
that DMCD exerted its general effects on the polyether antibiotic
production by binding to the partially reduced polyketide chains synthesized
by the PKS active in polyether biosynthesis. Moreover, there is evidence
that methyl-β-cyclodextrin can perturb the homeostasis of membrane
lipids by removing hopanoids in prokaryotic membranes.34 This perturbation may have effects on spiramycin
biosynthesis because membrane lipid metabolism is strictly interconnected
with the biosynthesis of spiramycin backbone through common biosynthetic
precursors.19 The other hypothetical mechanism
responsible for the enhancement of spiramycin production could be
a direct effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin on the spiramycin stability
and/or efflux due to complex formation. This latter hypothesis would
also account for the altered percentage ratios between spiramycin
I, II, and III and for the selective effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin
on spiramycin I yields. Therefore, we next analyzed the possible interaction
between spiramycin I and cyclodextrins by using chemical–physical
methods.

Physical–Chemical Characterization of the Cyclodextrin(s)@Spiramycin
I Complexes
Cyclodextrins are well-known for their aptitude
to provide inclusion complexes where the target molecules could be
inserted in the cavity for different applications, such as drug delivery.35 The Job plot of the continuous variation method36 is an analytical approach typically employed
for the study of the stoichiometry of such complexes37 and was used in this contribution by means of UV–vis
spectroscopy38,39 to study the capability of α-cyclodextrin,
β-cyclodextrin, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin to complex spiramycin
molecules with particular attention to the stoichiometry of the eventually
induced adduct (Figures 2 and 3, and Supporting Information Figure S2). Seven solutions (from A to G, as shown
in Table 1) containing
different amounts of spiramycin I stock solution and α-cyclodextrin
or β-cyclodextrin or methyl-β-cyclodextrin stock solution
were prepared to have 100 μmol as the total mole amount in 2
mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Supporting Information Figure S2A reports UV–vis spectra in the
200–500 nm range recorded for the A–G solutions obtained
by mixing spiramycin I and α-cyclodextrin. No shifts or new
absorption bands were induced by changing the molar ratio between
the two species. This result suggests that the formation of a complex
α-cyclodextrin/spiramycin I based on strong interactions should
be excluded. In fact, the continuous variation method allows the identification
of an adduct formed by the species with a chemical affinity enough
to consider such an adduct as a new chemical compound with different
physical–chemical properties, such as a different molar extinction
factor and so a distinct absorption pattern,40 which can be detected by monitoring the changes in the UV–vis
absorption features. The same result was obtained in the case of β-cyclodextrin
(Supporting Information Figure S2B). Probably,
the chemical affinity between spiramycin I and β-cyclodextrin,
also in this case, did not allow the formation of a complex, detectable
by observing the changes in the UV–vis spectra of the antibiotic.

Figure 2 (A) UV–vis
spectra recorded for the different solutions
obtained by mixing specific amounts of spiramycin I and methyl-β-cyclodextrin.
A new absorption band located at 279 nm was revealed in the E solution,
corresponding to a methyl-β-cyclodextrin/spiramycin I molar
ratio of 3:1 (gray line). In the inset a magnification of the 260–310
nm region is reported to better visualize the 279 nm absorption band.

Figure 2A depicts
the UV–vis spectra obtained for the seven different solutions
obtained by mixing a proper molar amount of spiramycin I and methyl-β-cyclodextrin.
The presence of a new absorption band located at 279 nm was revealed
in the case of solution E (gray line in Figure 2A and in the inset) and, so, when the spiramycin
I/methyl-β-cyclodextrin molar ratio was 1:3. The Job plot obtained
for the complex formed by spiramycin I and methyl-β-cyclodextrin
was obtained by plotting the absorbance variation at 279 nm, calculated
by subtracting the recorded absorbances at 279 nm of all solutions
by the recorded absorbance at 279 nm of solution A (100 μmol
of spiramycin I), versus the molar fraction (χ) of methyl-β-cyclodextrin.

The molar fraction, χ, was calculated as χ = (m4)/(m1 + m4), where m1 is
spiramycin I moles and m4 is methyl-β-cyclodextrin
moles.

The Job plot highlighted the formation of a complex methyl-β-cyclodextrin@spiramycin
I when the χ of methyl-β-cyclodextrin was 0.75, that is,
in the 3:1 stoichiometric ratio (Figure 2B). This result can be rationalized by excluding
the formation of a host@guest inclusion complex due to the individuated
stoichiometric ratio, steric hindrance, and the dimension of the antibiotic
compound, as further confirmed by the in silico modeling of cyclodextrins@spiramycin
I complexes study. The formation of noninclusion complexes among chemical
compounds and cyclodextrins was already reported for other systems,
such as for erythromycin29 and riboflavin.41

Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
measurements were
carried out to characterize the methyl-β-cyclodextrin@spiramycin
I complex and individuate the chemical groups involved in the binding
mechanism (Figure 3). Drop-casted films starting from an aqueous solution containing
18 × 10–8 mol of methyl-β-cyclodextrin
and 6 × 10–8 mol of spiramycin I were obtained
directly on the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) plate, and the
spectra were recorded after water evaporation, black and light gray
spectra in Figure 3A in the 1900–900 cm–1 frequency range.
The cyclodextrin spectrum is dominated by C–O, C–C–O,
and C–O–C stretching vibration modes of the glucopyranose
units in the range of 1200–900 cm–1.42 The light gray spectrum, corresponding to the
antibiotic cast film, is characterized by the IR features typical
of the macrocyclic lactone, and in particular by the C=O stretching
mode of the cyclic ester absorption located at 1721 cm–1, and of the oligosaccharide moieties, typically C–O stretching
modes in the 1200–900 cm–1 interval. A cast
film of an aqueous solution containing both cyclodextrin and antibiotic
in the proper molar ratio (18 × 10–8 and 6
× 10–8 mol, respectively) was further obtained
on the ATR plate (gray spectrum, Figure 3A). Because of the molar ratio, the complex
spectrum is dominated by cyclodextrin IR features that result almost
unchanged after the binding. Nonetheless, some interesting shifts
could be observed and allowed to individuate the main groups that
are involved in the interaction mechanism, in particular the carboxyl
group (COOH) of the antibiotic moiety and the OH groups of both compounds.
In fact, the most interesting regions of the complex spectrum are
the 1800–1650 cm–1 (Figure 3A) and 1150–800 cm–1 (Figure 3C) ranges.
The 1800–1650 cm–1 spectral range is characterized
by the C=O stretching mode of the spiramycin COOH group (light
gray line, Figure 3B), whose results shifted to a lower frequency (from 1721 to 1715
cm–1) after the complex formation (gray spectrum, Figure 3B), suggesting a
key role of the C=O group in the interaction, probably thanks
to hydrogen bonds formation. Besides, the 1150–800 cm–1 range of the complex spectrum (gray spectrum, Figure 3C) is characterized by the C–O stretching
modes, as already reported, mainly ascribable to cyclodextrin, and
by a broad band at about 910 cm–1 due to O–H
out-of-plane bending mode (squared in Figure 3C). In particular, such a vibration mode
is located at about 915 cm–1 in the case of cyclodextrin
(black line Figure 3C) and at about 905 cm–1 in the case of spiramycin
(light gray line, Figure 3C). Therefore, hydroxyl groups were also demonstrated to play
an important role in the binding mechanism. In fact, the O–H
out-of-plane bending vibrations in the complex spectrum provided a
broad band different from both OH out-of-plane modes of antibiotic
and cyclodextrin (squared in Figure 3C) underlining the OH involvement in the complex formation,
probably through hydrogen bonds.

Altogether, these findings
indicate that antibiotic compound size
and geometry did not allow being included in the cyclodextrin basket,
as already reported for erythromycin and cyclodextrin complexes.29 In particular, the Job plot experiments highlighted
the formation of a methyl-β-cyclodextrin@spiramycin complex
in the 3:1 stoichiometric ratio and no complex formation for the other
two kinds of cyclodextrin. Such a result could be rationalized, considering
that the presence of methyl substituents could induce geometric rearrangement
favoring the chemical communication among the two species. FT-IR spectroscopy
investigations allowed characterizing the obtained nonhost@guest complex
from a chemical point of view. Such an approach highlighted that the
binding mechanism is ruled by noncovalent chemical interactions, presumably
hydrogen bonds, involving the alcoholic functionalities of both constituents
and carboxylic functions of spiramycin I. Such interactions, although
nonspecific, takes place only in the case of methyl-β-cyclodextrin
because of the steric hindrance of the methyl goup.

In Silico Modeling
of Methyl-β-cyclodextrin@Spiramycin
I Complex
The interaction between spiramycin and cyclodextrins
was then modeled by using in silico docking tools. Models of spiramycin
I, α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin
were generated as detailed in the Methods section
and used as inputs for in silico docking by using AutoDock Vina.43 As a single molecule of spiramycin I was expected
to accommodate up to three molecules of each α-cyclodextrin,
β-cyclodextrin, or methyl-β-cyclodextrin, three or more
consecutive docking cycles were carried out starting from different
configurations (docking 1–5 in the Supporting Information Dataset S1) and selecting the best result from
each cycle (Supporting Information Dataset
S2). The best predictions were used to generate the final images with
Chimera44 (Figure 4 and Supporting Information Figures S3 and S4). According to the computational data, β-cyclodextrin
is a better complexing agent for spiramycin I than α-cyclodextrin,
probably because of the slightly larger space of the internal cavity.
The comparison of complexes formed by spiramycin I with β-cyclodextrin
or methyl-β-cyclodextrin indicated slightly lower values of
free energy of the complexes with β-cyclodextrin. This finding
seems to be in contrast with the Job plot data, indicating that only
methyl-β-cyclodextrin formed a complex with spiramycin I (Supporting Information Figure S1 and Figure 2). However, the docking
cycles illustrated in Supporting Information Figure S5 might explain this incongruence: β-cyclodextrin
seems to have a higher tendency to aggregate in the solution than
methyl-β-cyclodextrin that may be more available for physical
complexation with the antibiotic.

Figure 4 Complexes between spiramycin I and methyl-β-cyclodextrin
as modeled by AutoDock Vina and visualized by Chimera. The images
show three different conformations and the relative free energy of
the models of complex between spiramycin I and randomly methyled-β-cyclodextrins.

The arrangement of methyl-β-cyclodextrin@spiramycin
I complex
during fermentation may account for the stimulation of antibiotic
production. Indeed, spiramycin I complexation with methyl-β-cyclodextrin
may affect the antibiotic stability and/or antibiotic efflux through
the cell membrane that has been associated with the activity of SrmB
coding for the ATP-binding component of an ABC transporter.45 Methyl-β-cyclodextrin may facilitate the
efflux of spiramycin through the cell membrane, thereby decreasing
the intracellular concentration of the antibiotic and stimulating
its biosynthesis. A similar mechanism has been proposed to be involved
in a high stimulatory effect of β-cyclodextrin on the production
of lankacidin C by Streptomyces rochei because of the formation of an inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin
in the fermentation broth and abrogation of feedback repression.46 Our finding, however, does not rule out the
possibility that additional mechanisms may be involved in the stimulatory
effects of cyclodextrin on spiramycin production. As mentioned above,
methyl-β-cyclodextrin can perturb the homeostasis of membrane
lipids by removing hopanoids in prokaryotic membranes.34 This metabolic perturbation may indirectly affect
the spiramycin biosynthesis. In fact, the membrane lipid metabolism
is strictly interconnected with the biosynthesis of spiramycin, whose
macrolactone ring is built up by a PKS that, in addition to one unit
of each methylmalonyl-CoA, ethylmalonyl-CoA, and methoxymalonyl-CoA,
incorporates as many as four units of malonyl-CoA, a key precursor
of the membrane fatty acid biosynthesis.19 Thereby, in addition, to be valuable for increasing antibiotic yields
in batch fermentations and for the isolation of new metabolites that
are otherwise produced in only very small amounts,35 cyclodextrins can be further exploited to investigate the
complex interconnections between polyketide biosynthesis and membrane
lipid metabolism.

Another very interesting application fields
of cyclodextrins in
clinical pharmacology of antibiotic therapy concerns drug delivery.
Cyclodextrins are biocompatible and do not elicit an immune response
in humans.47 Thus, they are used as potential
drug carriers to enhance therapeutic drug efficiency and consequently
to reduce toxicity by the direct transportation to specific targets.47,48 Recent accumulating evidence indicates β-cyclodextrin complexation
as an effective drug delivery system [cyclodextrin inclusion complexes
(ISCOMs)] for different classes of antibiotics to circumvent the limitations
of conventional formulations and to treat drug resistance.49,50 With reference to macrolide antibiotics, complexes between β-cyclodextrin
and erythromycin have been proposed as a drug delivery device for
orthopedic application.29 Very promising
applications of ISCOMs include treatment of biofilm-resident microbes
that are also refractory to conventional antibiotic therapy.51 Spiramycin I is used to treat toxoplasmosis
and certain bacterial infections of soft tissues. In these tissues,
the antibiotic treatment lacks efficiency in spite of the documented
susceptibility of the causative pathogen to the administered antibiotic.52 Delivery of spiramycin with methyl-β-cyclodextrin
might augment the level of the bioactive drug at the site of infection
while reducing the dosage and the dosing frequency.

Conclusions
In this study we propose a new approach to improve the spiramycin
production process by manipulating the microenvironment of the fermentation
medium with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. By using physical–chemical
methods, we characterized the methyl-β-cyclodextrin@spiramycin
I nonhost@guest complex and modeled the interactions between methyl-β-cyclodextrin
and spiramycin I by in silico docking. Our findings will be useful
not only to understand the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the stimulatory
effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin on spiramycin I production but
also to develop a new device for better delivery of the antibiotic
at the site of infection by methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexation.

Methods
Bacterial
Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions
S. ambofaciens ATCC 23877 was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. The strain was stored in 1 mL cryotubes at
−80 °C as a frozen mycelium in a yeast–starch (YS)
medium containing 15% glycerol at a biomass concentration of approximately
0.25 g dry cell weight/mL or at −20 °C as spores in 20%
glycerol at a titer of approximately 5 × 108/mL. The
composition (per liter) of the media used in this study for the propagation
and growth of S. ambofaciens growth
are reported here. 2XYT (medium for spore resuspension): 16 g of tryptone,
10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl; YS broth (or agar): 2 g of
yeast extract, 10 g of soluble starch, and 18 g of agar in YS agar
(pH 7.0); and MBM (15): 1 g of MgSO4, 15 mg of ZnSO4, 2 g of KH2PO4, 5 g of CaCO3, 20 g of NaCl, and 0.3 mg of CoCl2. Glucose (40 g/L)
and 25 mM l-valine were added as the carbon and nitrogen
sources, respectively. When indicated, the bacterial broth cultures
in MBM containing glucose and l-valine were supplemented
with 0.5% (w/v) α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin,
or potato dextrin during the growth.

For fermentation experiments
in shake-flasks, spores in frozen aliquots were collected by centrifugation,
resuspended in 2XYT medium, and readily separated by vortexing. The
spore suspension (0.1 mL) (with and OD600nm of 1.22) was
inoculated into 50 mL YS broth in a 300 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The cultures
were incubated for about 24 h at 28 °C on an orbital shaker at
250 rpm until OD600nm reached 1.8. Then, 1 mL of YS broth
culture was used to inoculate 50 mL MBM containing glucose and l-valine. After 24 h of growth, when indicated, the MBM broth
cultures were supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin,
or methyl-β-cyclodextrin or potato dextrin. At different time
intervals, the biomass (OD600nm) and spiramycin concentration
were determined.

Spiramycin Production Assay
Spiramycin
production by S. ambofaciens broth
cultures was assessed by high-performance
liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-MS (HPLC–ESI-MS).
At different time intervals, supernatants were filtered through a
Phenex-RC membrane (0.45 mm; Phenomenex). Five microliters of a 1
ppm solution of erythromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile and water
(30:70, v/v) and 210 μL of acetonitrile were added to 1 mL Eppendorf
tubes containing 500 μL of filtrated samples; the tubes were
vortexed and centrifugated at 4 °C for 5 min, and then 2 μL
of the supernatant was injected for spiramycin determination.

The HPLC–ESI-MS apparatus was constituted by a Thermo Surveyor
MS quaternary pump coupled to a Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus mass detector
equipped with an ESI source and an ion trap quadrupole. The mass spectrometer
was operated in the positive-ion mode, with a capillary temperature
of 325 °C and capillary voltage of 1.5 kV.25 The mass spectra were recorded between 250 and 1000 m/z. Spiramycin I, II, and III were separated
on a reverse phase C18 analytical column (Bio Basic C-18, 150 ×
2.1 mm, particle size 5 μm; Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate
of 200 μL min–1 using 5 mM ammonium formate
adjusted to pH 7.0 (solvent A) and LC-MS-grade acetonitrile (solvent
B) applying the following gradient of B: 0 min, 15%; 1 min, 15%; 15
min, 70%; 20 min, 70%; 21 min, 15%; and 25 min, 15%. Purified spiramycin
complex (consisting of about 80% spiramycin I, 5% spiramycin II, and
10% spiramycin III) (Sigma-Aldrich) or purified spiramycin I (Sanofi)
freshly dissolved in 5 mM ammonium formate (pH 7) was used as the
standard. To avoid the interference of cyclodextrins in the mass spectrometric
determination and their deposition on the source, the flow was directed
to the source only during erythromycin and spiramycin elution by using
the divert valve on the MS instrument. Analyte quantification was
performed with the internal standard (IS) method: spiramycin responses
were normalized to the erythromycin IS area. The recoveries of the
method, evaluated by spiking the samples with low (200 ng) and high
(2 μg) levels of analyte, were 97 and 93%, respectively. The
limit of detection and the limit of quantification determined at S/N
ratios of 3 and 10 for spiramycin were, respectively, 20 and 67 ng/mL.

Job Plot Experiments and FT-IR Characterization
α-Cyclodextrin,
β-cyclodextrin, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without further purifications.
Purified spiramycin I was provided by Sanofi. For Job plot experiments,
spiramycin I, α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin
stock solutions containing 250 μmol of each compound dissolved
in 0.5 L of PBS 1× at pH 7.2 were prepared. Then, seven dilutions
(from A to G) of spiramycin I stock solution with different amounts
of cyclodextrin stock solutions were prepared as indicated in the Table 1 to carry out three
different experiments. A total volume of 2 mL was chosen.

UV–vis
absorption spectra of A–G solutions in the three experiments
were recorded by means of an Agilent Cary 5000 instrument. ATR-FTIR
measurements were taken with a PerkinElmer Spectrum One instrument.
In particular, a cast film of spiramycin I, a cast film of methyl-β-cyclodextrin,
and a cast film of the complex methyl-β-cyclodextrin/spiramycin
I in the stoichiometric 3:1 ratio were obtained directly on the ATR
plate starting from the aqueous solution. Sixty four scans were acquired
in each case.

In Silico Modeling
Models of spiramycin
I, α-cyclodextrin,
and β-cyclodextrin were downloaded by using the RCSB database,
and hydrogen was added by Avogadro53 specific
function. Models of methyl-β-cyclodextrin, starting from the
model of β-cyclodextrin, were edited by using Avogadro software
to add methylation in different positions and to optimize the molecular
geometry. These models were used as inputs for in silico docking by
using AutoDock Vina,43 using spiramycin
I as a receptor and cyclodextrins as ligands. As a single molecule
of spiramycin I was expected to accommodate up to three molecules
of each α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, or methyl-β-cyclodextrin,
three or more consecutive docking cycles were carried out starting
from the different docking configuration (docking 1–5 in the Supporting Information Dataset S1) and selecting
the best result from each cycle. The first cycle aimed to define the
relative position between spiramycin I and cyclodextrin, and the second
cycle aimed to define the position of second and third cyclodextrins
using a receptor from the first selected result (spiramycin/cyclodextrin
1:1 complex). Finally in the last docking, we used spiramycin as a
ligand and cyclodextrins as receptors to obtain a better configuration
of the complex and to compute the total energy of affinity (kcal/mol).
The best predictions were used to generate the final images with Chimera.44 For methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which contains
randomly 2-O, 3-O, or 6-O-methylated glucose moieties, we modified
β-cyclodextrin in the predicted complex by sequentially adding
methyl groups in different positions (Supporting Information Figure S1). Different combinations were tested
and the best docking outputs were used to generate the final images
with Chimera. Finally, we performed a docking cycle to clarify the
self-aggregation of cyclodextrins in the solution and the mechanism
of complex formation: the ligand and receptor molecular model is the
same (cyclodextrins methylated or not). More detailed information
is reported in the Supporting Information Dataset S2.
