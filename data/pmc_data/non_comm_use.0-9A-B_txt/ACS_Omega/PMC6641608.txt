Two
compositions of mixed oxygen carriers (OCs), N1F1A1 (mole ratio
of NiO to Fe2O3 is 1:1) and N1F2 (mole ratio
of NiO to Fe2O3 is 1:2), were fabricated by
mechanical mixing, and the effects of CeO2 and MgO additives
on the oxygen-transfer capacity (OTC) and crystal structure were analyzed.
In addition, X-ray diffractometry after the oxidation and the reduction
steps was carried out to determine the reaction mechanism. Potential
mixed OCs of the candidates of various OCs, such as NiO/Fe2O3, are proposed based on the OTC and oxygen-transfer
rate evaluated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) phase analysis and thermogravimetric
analysis. The chemical reaction equation for the oxidation and reduction
was suggested based on the XRD characterization of the phases including
NiFe2O4 and MgAl2O4 in
N1F1A1 (①) and N1F1A1-Mg5 (④). Addition of MgO is confirmed
to enhance the OTC and oxygen-transfer rate. The mechanism of the
oxidation and reduction of metal oxides and the role of MgO were suggested.
Even though the addition of MgO does not transfer oxygen to the fuel,
it does accelerate the oxidation and reduction reactions of NiFe2O4.

1 Introduction
Chemical-looping combustion
(CLC) technology, an indirect combustion
technology using oxygen carriers (OCs), is seen as a possible system
for low-cost CO2 capture with low power losses. CLC consists
of an oxidation reactor (combustion of metals) and a reduction reactor
(organic fuel combustion), between which the OC continuously circulates.1−3 CH4 and syngas are usually used as the organic fuel,
and there are some reports on the usage of coal (Figure 1).4−8

Figure 1 CLC
(M: metal, MO: metal oxide).

Optimization of OC is the key to successful exploitation
of CLC
technology. The key characteristics to optimize are their oxygen-transfer
capacity (OTC), oxygen-transfer rate, and properties for fluidization
(shape, size, and compaction density) and high durability (strength
and heat resistance) because they will be used for extended periods
of time in a fluidized bed at 900–1100 °C. Metal oxides
such as Mn2O3, Fe2O3,
NiO, CuO, and CoO have been used as OCs on supports such as bentonite,
yttria-stabilized zirconia, Al2O3, MgO, TiO2, NiAl2O4, MgAl2O4, SiO2, and ZrO2. Since 2008, NiO on an Al2O3 support has been viewed as the best OC for CLC.9−16

We are working on the scale-up of a system to 1–10
MW, based
on the successful 100+ hour operation of a 200 kW gas circulation
combustion system using NiO/Al2O3 OC produced
by gas atomization.17 Nickel oxide is expensive,
and nickel compounds are toxic. Thus, finding reasonable supplemental
materials that cancel out any loss in the CLC profitability by their
low cost is useful. It has been estimated that replacing about 30%
of the NiO with iron oxides could lower costs substantially despite
decreasing the reaction efficiency.18−20 These cost reductions
become significant when considering the material requirements of a
300 MW plant over a single year—about 100 tons. Should solid
organic fuels be used rather than syngas, costs are expected to sink
even further.21,22

In addition to the basic
MO-on-support structure described above,
improvements to the CLC parameters have been gained as a result of
the addition of other MO components. Examples include alkali metal
oxides, Li2O and K2O. Ab initio DPF (density
functional theory) was used to study the synergistic effects of MgO
in interactions
of CO, O2, and Fe2O3.23 The most interesting is CeO2, which
accelerates the catalytic activity or even modifies the characteristics
of the transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni). CeO2 is reported
to have a high oxygen storage capacity because of the high redox potential
and strong interaction between support metals and Ce.24−27

In this paper, OC mixtures of NiO and Fe2O3 with mole ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 with added CeO2 and MgO
are investigated. The mechanical properties of all the fabricated
CLC media tested here are the same so that differences in their chemical
reactivities can be assessed. We propose a reaction mechanism for
the oxidation and reduction steps based on phase analyses of the specimens
at each step.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Fabrication Method
The starting materials
are NiO (nickel oxide green), Fe2O3 (iron oxide
red 3150 RM Deqing United Pigment Co.,
Ltd.), γ-Al2O3 (vgl-15 Union Showa K.K.),
and CeO2 and MgO, all >98% purity. The OC was fabricated
via mechanical mixing, dried for 24 h in a convection oven, and calcined
in an air environment muffle furnace whose temperature was set to
1100 °C.

2.2 Measurements
The
OTC and oxygen-transfer
rate were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Linseis) in
10% methane and 90% CO2 gas for reduction and in air for
oxidation at 950 °C under the conditions listed in Table 1. Oxidation and reduction were
repeated for at least five cycles with a 5 min nitrogen gas purge
in between steps. The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD; D/Max 2200 Rigaku International) at 40 kV, 30 mA of Cu Kα,
in the range of 10–100° for 2θ. XRD patterns were
taken after each oxidation and reduction step to elucidate the reaction
mechanism.

2.3 Calculations
For
the selection of
the optimum candidates, OC particles are evaluated for the mechanical
property such as wear resistance and reactivity. However, only the
reactivity was assessed because the screening of the OCs of similar
mechanical properties is the main purpose of this study. TGA gives
a measurement of the OTC of the mixed OC, Co, which is the highest oxygen-transfer ratio of the OC for given
reaction conditions, as given in eq 1. 1  where mox is the
mass of the particles upon complete oxidation of the OC particles
and mred,e is the mass of the particles
upon complete reduction of the OC particles, as measured by TGA.

The Co thus determined is compared to
the theoretical value, R0, derived from
the stoichiometry of the MO. The oxygen-transfer rate is expressed
as dx/dt, where x is given by 2  where mred is
the mass of the particles upon complete reduction of the OC particles.

XRD patterns are taken to determine the effect of the crystal structure
on the OTC and oxygen-transfer rate, as measured by TGA.

3 Results and Discussion
The theoretical value Ro of the OTC
is calculated based on the ratio of NiO and Fe2O3. The high OTC for all eight specimens of this study is probably
partly due to the method of fabrication, mechanical mixing, and the
low calcination temperature of 1100 °C. Specimens fabricated
via spray-drying tend to lower the OTC values than the theoretically
predicted ones. This is because OTC decreases as the calcination temperature
increases.

3.1 NiO/Fe2O3/Al2O3 Mixed Metal Oxide (N1F1A1)
3.1.1 N1F1A1
Composition
In Table 2, the OC specimens
are listed with the weight fraction of the oxides, where N1F1 indicates
a 1:1 molar ratio in NiO and Fe2O3, C5 and C10,
respectively, contain 5 and 10% CeO2, and Mg5 contains
5% MgO.

Table 3 shows the

without additive ①, addition of MgO 5% improves the OTC more
than CeO2 10% as shown by the highest measured OTC of 8.45
of the mixed metal oxide ④.

The mass-based conversion
as a function of reaction time of reduction
and oxidation is shown in Figure 2. As Figure 2 shows, the reduction of single metal oxide OCs, that is,
N70 (NiO 70% + Al2O3 30% as a support) and Fe70
(Fe2O3 70% + Al2O3 30%
as a support), completed in a few minutes,21,22 whereas N1F1A1 (the mixed OC) took 7–9 min to complete the
reduction. However, the oxidation reaction was completed in 2 min,
regardless of the composition. The time needed to complete the reduction
in increasing order is ④ (7.8 min), ① (8.2 min), ②
(8.4 min), and ③ (8.9 min).

and oxidation (right) of N1F1A1.

3.1.3 Crystal Structure Analysis
Table 4 lists the major peak
intensities of the XRD patterns. The specimens of ①, ②,
and ③ characteristically showed NiFe2O4, Al2O3, and residual CeO2. On the
other hand, specimen ④ has MgAl2O4 and
MgFeAlO4 peaks in addition to the major peaks of NiFe2O4, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 (Figure 3).

This is attributed to the reaction of NiO and Fe2O3, resulting in NiFe2O4 with
residual
Al2O3 and CeO2 in ①, ②,
and ③. In ④, all NiO reacts with Fe2O3, forming NiFe2O4, whereas all MgO reacts
with Al2O3 and Fe2O3,
forming MgAl2O4 and MgFeAlO4, leaving
residual Al2O3 and Fe2O3.

The possible reaction equations involving NiO, Fe2O3, and Al2O3 are as follows: 3   4   5   6  

The XRD patterns
indicate that reaction 5 is the major working
mechanism in the NiO/Fe2O3/Al2O3 mixed OCs because the XRD patterns do
not show phases indicated by reactions 3, 4, and 6 (Figure 2). In ①, ②, and ③, the
measured values of OTC are higher than the theoretical predicted values
because of the formation of NiFe2O4; the presence
of residual Al2O3 and CeO2 indicates
that CeO2 does not influence the system significantly.
On the other hand, the fact that MgAl2O4 and
MgFeAlO4 are formed in addition to NiFe2O4 in ④ is taken as an indication of the participation
of MgO in the reaction, resulting in the improvement of OTC and oxygen-transfer
rate.

NiFe2O4 was formed when the molar
ratio of
NiO, Fe2O3, and Al2O3 was
1:1:1 with added CeO2 or MgO. These mixtures yielded higher
OTC than that predicted by the theory, thanks to the high oxygen content
of NiFe2O4 (24 wt%) compared to that of NiO
(21 wt%). With the MgO addition (④), OTC and oxygen-transfer
rate were the highest, which is attributed to the accelerated formation
of NiFe2O4 and additional role of MgFeAlO4 presumably.

Consequently, N1F1A1 OC was fabricated
with a 1:1:1 molar ratio
of NiO, Fe2O3, and Al2O3 with CeO2 addition, and the potential binder species,
NiAl2O4, was not formed. However, when MgO is
added, the peaks of MgAl2O4 and MgFeAlO4 are observed. The measured OTC values of 1.2–1.5 times
the theoretical OTC value are considered to be due to the formation
of NiFe2O4 (24 wt%), as shown by the highest
intensity peak in the XRD pattern (Figure 3).

3.2 NiO/Fe2O3 Mixed Metal
Oxide (N1F2)
3.2.1 N1F2 Composition
Table 5 lists the
compositions of the
sample compounds; N1F2 designates the sample with a molar ratio 1:2
of NiO to Fe2O3. C5, C10, and M5 correspond
to 5 and 10% of CeO2 and 5% of MgO, respectively.

3.2.2 Oxygen-Transfer
Capacity
Table 6 shows that the OTCs
of the specimens listed in Table 5 are comparable and about 2 times the theoretical values.

⑦ N1F2C10	CeO2 10	5.76	11.64	
⑧ N1F2M5	MgO 5	6.09	12.25	
As shown in Figure 4, the mixed oxides
of N1F2 composition took 6–10 min for reduction
and less than 5 min for oxidation (on the right side of the graph).
The order of the reduction rate of the specimens (duration until the
completion of the reaction) is ⑧ (6.2 min), ⑦ (7.2 min),
⑤ (7.6 min), and ⑥ (10 min), and the order of the oxidation
rate (duration until the completion of the reaction) is ⑤ (2.5
min), ⑧ (3.0 min), and ⑥, ⑦ (4.5 min). Thus,
the sample with 5% MgO showed the highest reaction rate, while the
amount of CeO2 content seems to have no effect on the reaction
rates.

and oxidation (right) of N1F2.

3.2.3 Crystal Structure Analysis
Table 7 shows the major peaks
and intensities of the XRD spectrum of the OCs in Table 5. N1F2 (⑤), N1F2C5 (⑥),
and N1F2C10 (⑦) have peaks of NiFe2O4, Al2O3, and residual CeO2, but
N1F2M5 (⑧) has only NiFe2O4/MgFe23+O4. In ⑤, ⑥, and ⑦,
NiO and Fe2O3 reacted and yielded NiFe2O4 with residual Fe2O3 and CeO2. However, N1F2M5 (⑧) behaves different from N1F1A1M5
(④) because of the presence of Al2O3.
As shown in the XRD pattern of Figure 5, N1F2M5 (⑧) forms NiFe2O4 from the reaction of NiO and Fe2O3, and the
residual Fe2O3 and MgO are believed to react
to form MgFe23+O4. MgFe23+O4 and NiFe2O4 are
considered as the similar phase as shown by the angles and intensity
of the XRD peaks (Figure 6). → MgFe23+O4 and
NiFe2O4 are both diamond cubic (Fd3̅m), the NiFe2O4 structure
(ICDD 10-0325) has a lattice parameter of ∼8.339 Å, and
MgFe23+O4 (ICDD 17-0464) has a lattice
parameter of ∼8.375 Å, respectively.28,29

pattern of MgFe23+O4 and NiFe2O4 in N1F2M5 (⑧).

Phase Peaks and Their Main
Peak Intensities in N1F2 Samples
sample/peak	NiFe2O4	Fe2O3	CeO2	
⑤ N1F2	355	100

⑦ N1F2C10	260	108	117	
⑧ N1F2M5	NiFe2O4,
MgFe23+O4	
Consequently, the fact that the experimentally
measured OTC value
of N1F2 composition fabricated with the molar ratio 1:2 of NiO to
Fe2O3 is about 2 times higher than the theoretical
values is due to the OTC of NiFe2O4 (24 wt%),
which is higher than that of NiO (21 wt%). On the other hand, the
high OTC of N1F2M5 (⑧) is due to the formation of MgFe3+O3 in addition to NiFe2O4.

3.3 Elucidation of Mechanism
To elucidate
the reaction mechanism and the effects of additives, XRD analyses
were carried out for specimens obtained at the oxidation and reduction
steps of N1F1A1 (①) and N1F1A1-M5 (④).

3.3.1 N1F1A1 (①)
Figure 6 shows the XRD patterns of
N1F1A1 (①), before TGA, after TGA oxidation, and after TGA
reduction. The results indicate that NiFe2O4 is the main phase before and after the oxidation of (①),
but NiFe2O4 disappears upon reduction and FeNi3 and Fe2O3 form. Thus, we can confirm
that N1F1A1 (①) forms NiFe2O4 through
the reaction of NiO and Fe2O3 during calcination
at 1100 °C. According to the results, it appears to remain as
NiFe2O4 during oxidation and converts to FeNi3 and Fe2O3 during reduction, as expressed
in eq 7. 7  

3.3.2 N1F1A1-M5 (④)
The XRD patterns
of N1F1A1M5 (④) before and after the oxidation and reduction
(Figure 7) indicate
that MgFeAlO4 is the major phase upon oxidation, whereas
MgAl2O4, MgO, and Fe2O3 are the major phases upon reduction. Equation 8 shows a possible reaction scheme, in which
iron is displaced by Al from MgFeAlO4 upon oxidation and
reincorporated, yielding free oxygen, during reduction. 8  

Figure 7 XRD patterns
for reduced, oxidized, and original samples of N1F1A1M5
(④).

The difference in oxidation
and reduction in N1F1A1 (①)
and N1F1A1M5 (④) is the involvement of MgO in the reaction,
and the results indicate that MgO enhances the OTC and oxygen-transfer
rate. Thus, we conclude, based on the XRD results, that MgO does not
transfer oxygen to the fuel directly but rather indirectly accelerates
the reduction reaction of NiFe2O4, thereby increasing
the OTC and oxygen-transfer rate.

4 Conclusions
Eight OCs (four each of N1F1A1 and N1F2) were fabricated via mechanical
mixing, and their OTC and crystal structure were analyzed to determine
the effect of additives, CeO2 and MgO. The reaction mechanism
was found by analyzing the phases of N1F1A1 and N1F1A1M5.(1) It is
known that the OTC of OCs fabricated
by spray-drying is lower than the predicted theoretical values and
is lowered as the calcination temperature is increased. Our OTCs are
higher because the samples are made by mechanical mixing, and they
are calcined at a lower temperature, 1100 °C.

(2) The reduction and oxidation were completed
within 7–9 min and 2 min, respectively. The OTCs were 1.2–1.5
times the theoretical value. This is attributed to the high fraction
of NiFe2O4 (24 wt%), which has an OTC value
higher than NiO (21 wt%). In N1F1A1, NiAl2O4, which can act as a binder, was not formed. However, NiAl2O4 and MgFeAlO4 peaks were observed when MgO
was added.

(3) In N1F2,
reduction and oxidation were
completed within 6–10 min and within 5 min, respectively. The
OTCs were measured as ∼2 times the theoretical value because
of the high fraction of NiFe2O4 (24 wt%), which
has higher OTC than NiO.

(4) The mechanism of the oxidation and
reduction of metal oxides and the role of MgO were suggested as same
as that in N1F1A1; NiFe2O4 forms during calcination
through the reaction of NiO, Fe2O3, and Al2O3, remains as NiFe2O4 during
oxidation, and converts to FeNi3 and Fe2O3 during the reduction reaction.



Addition of MgO is confirmed to enhance the OTC and oxygen-transfer
rate. Even though the addition of MgO does not transfer oxygen to
the fuel, it does accelerate the oxidation and reduction reactions
of NiFe2O4.
