Agro-waste-extracted cellulose-supported
CuInS2 nanocomposites
were hydrothermally synthesized with significant photocatalytic activity
under the influence of cellulose as a polymeric natural support that
offers delay in electron–hole life. Delayed recombination process
of electrons and holes was perceived by parting of cellulose as a
barrier or edge during photochemical reaction, which overall enhances
the lifetime of photocatalyst. The photodegradation efficiency over
five consecutive cycles along with scavenging studies have been examined
for RhB dye under visible light. The boosted photodegradation rate
was observed at an optimum amount of cellulose (200 mg), which is
∼10 times higher than pristine CuInS2.

Introduction
Photocatalysis is one
of the most effective and rapidly growing
areas to overcome the issues related to energy and environment. Attractive
efficiency and low cost make photocatalysts potential candidates for
various applications like air purification, hydrogen production, antibacterial
activities, and degradation of organic pollutants/dyes. Photocatalytic
performance of a semiconductor photocatalyst highly depends on its
charge separation efficiency and light absorption ability. Therefore,
more electron–hole pairs will be generated if narrow-band-gap
semiconductors working under visible light are used. In addition,
the morphology of semiconductor photocatalyst plays an important role
in affecting the charge carrier efficiency. Thus, it is a current
need to develop an environment-friendly visible light photocatalyst
that can degrade the toxic organic dyes.1 While being specific about dyes, basic RhB dye exists in cationic
as well as zwitterionic forms. Cationic dyes are highly toxic and
known to cause skin irritations, allergic dermatitis, cancer, and
other mutations. It falls in the group of xanthene dyes, which means
it possesses aromatic compounds and xanthene rings, which are a major
source known to pollute the environment. Intermediates used in synthesizing
dyes, pesticides, polymers, etc. mainly comprise xanthene rings, which
pollute groundwater, and they need to be removed to a maximum extent.
Between photocatalytic and photosensitization processes, the photocatalytic
method has been widely accepted for the degradation of RhB.2

I-III-VI2 ternary semiconductor compounds
are topic of research
since years due to their wide range of applications in solar cells,
photocatalytic splitting of water, phosphors, light-emitting devices,
pigments, and nonlinear optical devices.3,4 Among these
chalcopyrites, direct-band-gap (1.53 eV) semiconductor CuInS2 with high absorption coefficient
(105 cm–1) shows excellent stability
under solar radiation and easy conversion of charge carriers. CuInS2 exists in three different crystalline phases—wurtzite,
chalcopyrite, and zinc blende, among which only the chalcopyrite phase
with tetragonal structure is stable at room temperature.5 The band gap of CuInS2 can be tuned
further for wide visible light range by controlling the size and shape
into nano-dimension. CIS QDs have been used as sensitizers in solar
cells due to their enhanced efficiency of charge transfer.6 Enhancement in electrochemical performance is
visible when CIS is applied in lithium-ion batteries.7 CIS, ZnO/CIS core–shell nanoarrays, and graphene/graphene
oxide/CIS nanofilms have been used for the electrochemical water splitting.8−10 Further, CuInS2 thin films had been widely used as absorber
layers to utilize visible light in photovoltaic cell, but very few
reports are available on CuInS2 as a visible-light-responding
photocatalyst for degradation of organic dyes.11,12

Photocatalytic activity of bare CuInS2 is poor
due to
fast charge carrier recombination. To improve the photocatalytic performance,
various efforts have been made in the past, such as nanostructure
synthesis with morphology control, elemental doping, and facet engineering,13 which aid in light harvesting and charge movement.14 Xei et al. synthesized Pt–CuInS2 hierarchal microarchitectures as improved visible-light photocatalyst
for H2 production from water.15 However, high cost of Pt limits its widespread applications. Moreover,
out of various morphologies, hollow structures possess better photocatalytic
activity due to the large fraction of empty space and high surface
area. Metal sulfides are believed to be the most promising photocatalysts
as they possess narrow band gaps along with valence bands at negative
potential in comparison to oxides. Thus, it results in an enhanced
visible light photocatalytic activity. Using only CdS which also posses
narrow band gap does not result in desired catalytic performance as
it induces photocorrosion.16 Most of the
methods used for the synthesis of hollow spheres till date are either
template-based or include Ostwald ripening17 and the Kirkendall effect.18 In addition,
organic–inorganic hybrid synthesis is also found to be an effective
way to improve physicochemical properties. Thus, to further enhance
the photocatalytic activity of CuInS2 hollow structures,
a cost-effective, easy, and renewable organic material as a support
is needed. Hence, supporting naturally isolated polymer as base would
enhance its photocatalytic efficiency.

Recently, various efforts
have been made for replacement of petrochemical-based
organic materials by those derived from renewable resources.19 To meet the challenges of sustainable development,
the discarded biomass from the agro-based industries is utilized to
its full extent as a source of extraction for green route approach.
This discarded waste contains pectin, hemicelluloses, and cellulose
and these are widely applicable in food,20 pharmaceutical,21 cosmetics,22 and polymer industries.23,24 Cellulose is one of the ubiquitous materials in nature that includes
plants (cotton, wood, soy, sugarcane) and natural materials like bacteria
and tunicates as their major sources. Polysaccharides play a crucial
role in designing functional food, unique biomaterials, and carriers
for bioactive substances as they possess versatile physicochemical
properties along with edibility and biocompatibility. It is one such
biodegradable and abundant organic polymer whose composites have received
much attention due to its low density, chirality, hydrophilicity,
biodegradability, nontoxic nature, and low cost.25,26 It has a long straight-chain polymer packed with inter- and intramolecular
H- bonding.27,28 For fabrication of various composites,
it is used as a reinforcing material due to its high mechanical strength.29,30 Here, in this manuscript, agro-waste is used to extract cellulose,
which is used in different weight ratios (in situ and ex situ) to
develop cellulose-supported CuInS2 nanocomposites (Cel/CIS)
via hydrothermal strategy. The hydrothermal route used here is surfactant-
and template-free. The novel photocatalysts were examined for photodegradation
of RhB dye under visible light by decreasing the charge recombination
trend.

Results and Discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of pure cellulose (Cel), bare
CuInS2 (Cu0), and ex situ and in situ cellulose-supported
CuInS2 nanocomposites (Cu ex and Cu1-Cu5) are shown in Figure 1a. All of the diffraction
peaks of bare CIS were indexed as tetragonal phase of CuInS2 (JCPDS file no.750106). CIS showed peaks corresponding to planes
(112), (200), (220), (312), and (224). The intensity of cellulose
diffraction peak in the (200) plane gradually enhanced in Cu1, Cu2,
and Cu5, which confirms the formation of Cel/CIS nanocomposites with
no other impurities. Figure 1b shows scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) elemental mapping of Cu2 photocatalyst
and a clear evidence of the existence of C, O, Cu, In, and S elements
in Cel/CIS nanocomposite.

and Cu0 to Cu5 nanocomposites.

As the fruit bran already contains hemicellulose,
cellulose, pectin,
and lignin, the FTIR spectra shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information file shows the characteristic peak
of cellulose at 3417 cm–1 owing to its O–H
stretch. The wide band indicates the presence of strong intermolecular
H-bonding in Cel. The shoulder peak at 2853 cm–1 is assigned to various types of symmetric and asymmetric vibrations
of the CH2 group. The peaks in the range of 1638–1150
cm–1 are attributed to angular deformation vibrations
of C–O–H. The peaks present between 1150 and 915 cm–1 correspond to vibration and elongation of −O–H
linkages. Glucosidic units are evident in the range of 950–617
cm–1.31 The field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of cellulose (Cel) showed
a rodlike morphology with an average aspect ratio of 10 (Figure 2a). The FESEM image
of CIS shows hierarchal hollow structures made up of nanoflakes with
the thickness of ∼50–55 nm, as apparent in Figure 2b. In Figure 2c, Cu2 nanocomposite shows
sphere-like hierarchal structures closely knotted with irregular or
rod-shaped cellulose. The corresponding EDX images indicate the formation
of isolated cellulose (Cel), pure CuInS2 (Cu0), and its
composite Cel/CIS (Cu2) (Figure 2d–f).

Figure 2 (a–c) FESEM images of Cel, Cu0, and Cu2
photocatalysts.
(d–f) EDX analysis of corresponding photocatalysts.

To further investigate the surface morphology and
structure, the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns for Cel (a–c), Cu0 (d–f), and Cu2 (g–i)
are shown in Figure 3. The TEM images of Cel show a sheetor rodlike morphology, whereas
the SAED patterns clearly show the crystalline nature of cellulose.
The interplanar distance (d) of Cel is found to be 0.35 nm with the
corresponding plane (200). The hierarchal hollow spheres of Cu0 are
made up from nanoflakes with size range of 35–40 nm that is
clearly seen in the FESEM image, too. The d-spacing
value is noted as 0.33 nm in Cu-0, which indicates the corresponding
plane (112). Similarly to the FESEM image, Cu2 shows spherical particles
on the cellulose surface, but in the TEM image, the size of particles
being in micron range are relatively larger to identify at a high-magnification.
The SAED pattern of the composite shows diffused rings that indicates
the polycrystalline nature of the sample. The d-spacing
values for Cu2 are found to be 0.37 nm and 0.34 nm corresponding to
planes (200) of cellulose and (112) of CIS. All of the calculations
for size and d-spacing were done by setting scale through Image J
software.

Cu0, and (g–i) Cu2 photocatalysts.

The surface chemistry and oxidation state of different atomic
species
present in sample Cu2 were investigated by recording their X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) images in the binding energy range of 0–1100
eV. Figure 4a presents
the survey scan of sample Cu2, and it reflects the peaks related to
Cu, In, S, C, and O only, which confirms the phase purity of the synthesized
sample. The high-resolution spectra of each element, i.e., Cu 2p,
In 3d, S 2p, C 1s, and O 1s, respectively, are shown in Figure 4b–f. Figure 4 b displays the XPS image of
S 2p core level and it inferred one broad peak with a shoulder, which
deconvoluted into two peaks, one at 161.3 eV (2p3/2) and
other at 162.3 eV (2p1/2) by fitting with an energy difference
of 1 eV and another peak at 169 eV. The peaks at 161.3 and 162.3 are
assigned to sulfur coordinated to Cu and In.32 The peak observed at 169 eV indicates coupling between the CIS nanostructures
and cellulose through −C-SOx–Cu/In bonding. The XPS
image of C 1s (Figure 4c) represents two peaks located at 284.7 and 286.1 eV assiged to
C–H and C–O interaction in the cellulose.33 However, compared to XPS data of pure cellulose
reported earlier, higher intensity of C–H peak in the present
work ensures the cellulose–CIS interaction and simultaneous
carbonization of cellulose with CIS. In Figure 4d, two peaks are visible, one at binding
energy 445.1 eV and other at 452.7 eV with peak splitting of 7.6 eV
were assigned to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 respectively,
indicating oxidation state In3+ which match well with the
previous reports of CuInS2. One single peak in the O 1s
spectrum (Figure 4e)
at 532 eV is associated with cellulose only and is consistent with
the reported data.34Figure 4f represents the XPS image of Cu 2p core
level and reveals two peaks at 931.9 eV (2p3/2) and 952
eV (2p1/2) with a spin–orbit separation of 20.1
eV, which confirms that the copper is present in the Cu+ state.35 The absence of satellite peak
at around 945 eV and the presence of LMNN peak in survey
scan also supports this finding.35 Furthermore,
a careful investigation indicates the asymmetric nature of the Cu
2p3/2 peak, which was deconvoluted into two peaks by fitting.
This asymmetric behavior may be due to the interaction of cellulose
with CIS nanostructures or due to the presence of Cu2+ to
a very small extent.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas
of Cel,
Cu0, and Cu2 were found to be 48, 263, and 139 m2/g, respectively
(Table S1). Here, the BET surface area
of pure cellulose (Cel) is minimum as expected due to the crystalline
nature of the material. Cu0 shows hollow hierarchical-type morphology
with small cavities due to arrangements of petals in the form of a
sphere. Due to these cavities and porelike structure, the material
shows maximum surface area (263 m2/g). In composite (Cu2),
the surface area of catalyst improved compared to pure cellulose due
to the interaction of cellulose support with CIS hollow structures. Figure 5 shows Barrett, Joyner,
and Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution of the Cel, Cu0, and Cu2
photocatalysts.

Figure 5 BJH pore size distribution of Cel, Cu0, and Cu2 photocatalysts.

Figure 6a,b shows
kinetic linear simulation plots for Cel, Cu ex, and Cu0 to Cu5 nanocomposites.
The photocatalytic activity of all of the photocatalysts has been
examined under the influence of (Tungsten) W light source, as shown
in Figure 6a. The photocatalytic
activity of pure cellulose and commercial cellulose was checked which
showed only 10 and 20% degradation in 35 min, while composites expressed
photodegradation faster compared to bare CIS (Cu0) and Cel. Cu1 photocatalyst
degraded up to 70% in 25 min, Cu2 up to 80%, and Cu5 degraded up to
the level of 75% in the same time. However, CIS shows photodegradation
70% in 25 min, which was equal to Cu1, as very less amount of cellulose
(100 mg) is present. These experiments conclude that overall composites
(Cel/CIS) showed good photocatalytic activity compared to bare CIS
and Cel. Here, the optimal amount of cellulose was also checked where
the maximum degradation was achieved. The photodegradation efficiency
was observed for all photocatalysts using the following equation.
Photodegradation efficiency = (Cn – C0)/Cn × 100.
The photodegradation rates of all of the photocatalysts have also
been calculated. The photodegradation rate was calculated using the
ln C0/Cn versus t plot and fitting in linear first-order
rate kinetics. The degradation rates and half-lives of all of the
photocatalysts are shown in Table 1. Cu0 expressed a rate of 0.046 min–1, while the Cu2 photocatalyst, which showed the highest photodegradation,
showed a rate of 0.056 min–1. Thus, it is concluded
that the composite showed its maximum activity with the chalcopyrite
semiconductor in existence of cellulose support at a weight ratio
of 200 mg and achieved rate higher in comparison to Cu0.

Figure 6c,d shows
scavenging and recyclability tests of Cu2 photocatalyst. In the presence
of EDTA, it showed photodegradation of only 49%, 47% for p-benzoquinone, and 30% for isopropanol, which means that the photocatalyst
shows less photodegradation even after inhibiting the process. Recyclability
was done for the Cu2 photocatalyst up to five cycles. Negligible change
was observed in photodegradation efficiencies, and even after five
cycles, it showed 71% degradation efficiency. Figure 7a shows time-resolved photoluminescence spectra
of Cel, Cu0, and Cu2 photocatalysts. Cel showed an average lifetime
of 1.5 ns. The average lifetime of bare Cu0 was found to be 265 ns,
and Cu2 shows 200 ns, which is very close to that of bare Cu0. Time-resolved
data fitting is shown in Table S2. Figure 7b depicts a schematic
representation of the proposed photocatalyst mechanism of Cel/CIS
nanocomposites for degradation of RhB dye in visible light source
(W) of 200 W. The possible mechanism of photodegradation
of dye can be explained as shown in the schematic diagram, which explains
that when visible light source is switched on, the electron–hole
pairs of chalcopyrite semiconductor CIS get separated. Excited electrons
reach conduction band (CB) from valence band (VB), making hole in
VB. Photogenerated electrons reduce O2 molecules, which
are adsorbed on surface of catalyst, leading to the formation of O2–• radicals. Charge transfer may
take place between Cel and CIS. The active holes react with H2O to generate •OH. This •OH radical degrades organic dyes in the presence of visible light
irradiation. Cellulose influenced the photodegradation process due
to delayed charge recombination period by being a support. Cu0 also
has active adsorption sites due to its hollow and porous nature. More
photogenerated electrons and holes are developed while using Cu2 photocatalyst
because of creation of edge or interface between two materials (cellulose
and CuInS2).

photocatalysts. (b) Schematic representation of the mechanism of dye

Table 2 shows
the
literature from recent years, where CIS is used with various other
semiconductors for different applications. It has been used with g-C3N4 and other inorganic materials. From this, we
realize that polymer derived from waste has not been used yet, which
is cost-effective and eco-friendly. Table 3 depicts sources used and time taken to degrade
RhB dye from the literature.

Here
are a few reports where RhB is degraded using different semiconductor
catalysts. Mostly, the source used is UV and visible light, but even
if the visible light is being used, the time achieved to degrade RhB
is quite longer than what we acheived in Cel/CuInS2. Moreover,
the starting material is developed from waste peels, which are discarded
mostly. Hence, our developed material is cost and time effective.

Conclusions
Here, we reported novel Cel/CIS photocatalyst synthesized hydrothermally
with controlled morphology. The unique point in our work is isolation
of cellulose from the waste and its use for environmental remediation
by developing visible-light-induced photocatalyst. These Cel/CIS have
superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity as electrostatic
interaction is witnessed between cellulose and CIS which aids in delaying
the charge carrier. Thus new, low-cost, and green route would influence
the production of catalyst on a large scale and can lay the foundation
of hybrid photocatalytic mechanism for other potential applications.

Materials
Indium chloride and sodium chlorite were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
India. Copper sulfate and sulfuric acid were bought from HiMedia.
Thiourea, N,N-dimethyl formamide,
and potassium hydroxide were purchased from SRL, India.

Experimental
Section
Isolation of Cellulose
Waste fruit rinds of specific
fruits in equal quantity (banana, orange, sweet lime, pomegranate)
were washed, ground, sieved by standard 200 mesh ASTM standard to
prepare bran. The ground peels were then boiled for 10 min to remove
sugars, phenolic compounds, and water-soluble polysaccharides. This
bran (50 g) was subjected to alkali hydrolysis with 5% KOH for 16
h. This was followed by bleaching treatment with 2% sodium chlorite
solution maintaining pH 5 for 1 h at 70 °C to decolorize the
solution. The residue was further treated with 2% sulfuric acid for
1 h at 80 °C. These treatments were repeated twice or thrice
as desired. In each step, the residue was neutralized and centrifuged
for the next step. The steps followed were slightly modified from
those given in refs (36, 37).

Synthesis of CIS Hollow Spheres
CIS hollow spheres
were synthesized via facile hydrothermal approach using 5 mmol InCl3 and CuSO4 were dissolved in 40 mL of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) to form a solution by
dynamic stirring. Thiourea (0.1 g) was added to it and the resulting
homogeneous solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless
steel autoclave maintained at 160 °C for 25 h.38 The black precipitates were centrifuged and dried at 60
°C and used for further characterization.

Synthesis of Cel/CIS Nanocomposite
Synthesis of cellulose-supported
copper indium sulfide (Cel/CIS) was carried out by adding different
weight ratios (100, 200, 500 mg) of cellulose in CIS solution via
in situ wet chemical approach. A similar procedure was repeated, and
the solution was kept in a hydrothermal autoclave at 160 °C for
25 h. For ex situ composite, 25 mg of bare CIS and isolated cellulose
(1:1 weight ratio) were taken in beaker, stirred, and sonicated for
30 min. The products were termed as Cu-0 for pure CuInS2, cellulose-supported copper indium sulfide with different weight
ratios (100, 200, 500 mg) as Cu-1, Cu-2, Cu-5, and Cu-ex for ex situ
synthesized nanocomposites.

Material Characterization
The phase
purity of all of
the photocatalysts was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
using Bruker D8 equipped with Cu Kα monochromatized incident
radiation of wavelength 0.1540 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra were recorded by PerkinElmer Sp65. The band gaps of all photocatalysts
were determined using Jasco 670 DRS. Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) images were taken using JEOL JSM 6390LV along with
their energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra. Surface area measurements
were carried out by a Quanta Chrome Nova Win station for Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and BJH analyses. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) images were collected using Jeol/JEM 2100. Lifetime measurements
of photocatalyst were done by Jobin Vyon Fluorocube with excitation
wavelength of 390 nm. Omicron ESCA, Germany, was used for obtaining
XPS images. Aluminum anode was used for samples with an approximate
energy of 1486.7 eV. The angle between source and analyzer was 85°.
Monochromatic X-ray was used, which has its resolution confirmed by
FWHM of 0.6 eV.

Photocatalytic Activity
Photocatalytic
experiments
for the developed novel Cel/CIS composites were performed using 10
mg of photocatalyst in 25 mL of RhB dye solution (1 μM) under
visible light irradiation (Tungsten, 200 W). The dye solution along
with the photocatalyst was absorbed in the dark for 15 min and later
kept under a light source until it showed maximum degradation. The
kinetic linear simulation plots were carried out from the absorption
data. Out of all of these photocatalysts, the best sample was chosen,
which gave the highest degradation efficiency, and further characterization
was done for that composite only. The recyclability of the photocatalysts
was analyzed by repeating the similar experiments up to five cycles.
Different scavengers such as EDTA, benzoquinone, and isopropanol in
1 mM concentrations were used to understand the mechanism of photogenerated
electrons and holes during the entire process.
