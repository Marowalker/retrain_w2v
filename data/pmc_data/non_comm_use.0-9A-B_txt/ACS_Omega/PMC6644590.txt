Heterostructured
composite ceria electrolytes have been shown to
accelerate the oxygen reduction activity and provide a new approach
to improve solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) performance. In this study,
barium carbonate was added to gadolinium-doped ceria, Gd0.2Ce0.8O2−δ (GDC) electrolyte to
improve the electrochemical performance of intermediate-temperature
SOFCs. The heterostructured electrolyte was formed by the addition
of 5 wt % BaCO3 to a GDC electrolyte, resulting in a reaction
during sintering that formed well-dispersed BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3−δ (BCG) throughout the electrolyte.
The resulting material was tested as an electrolyte using La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ as a cathode, resulting in a dramatic reduction to the polarization
resistance of more than half the value (600 and 700 °C, the resistance
was reduced from 2.49 and 0.23 Ω cm2 to 1.21 and
0.12 Ω cm2) obtained by using pure GDC as an electrolyte.
Furthermore, full cell SOFC tests employing the heterostructured electrolyte
conducted during overextended durations indicated that the BCG phase
in the 5BCG–GDC electrolyte was stable in an air atmosphere
with no observed reactions with residual CO2. This approach
of tailoring surface reactivity by tailoring the composition and structure
of the electrolyte as opposed to electrode materials provides an alternative
method to improve fuel cell performance.

==== Body
Introduction
Ceria (CeO2)-based materials have attracted extensive
attention because of their potential use as an intermediate temperature
electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).1−7 The interest in this material is due to the enhanced ionic conductivity
of doped ceria electrolytes as compared to conventional oxygen ion
conducting electrolytes based on yttria-stabilized zirconia. Despite
the promising ionic conduction properties of CeO2-based
electrolytes, their use is limited by reduction of Ce at low oxygen
partial pressure, which results in electronic conductivity and a decreased
open circuit potential. Attempts to optimize the functional properties
of doped ceria electrolytes have relied on two principal strategies:
(i) bilayer electrolytes fabricated via sputtering or sol–gel
coating process to block electric conduction and (ii) through the
creation of composite materials based on cerium oxide and barium.
Bilayered electrolyte membranes composed of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3−δ (BZCY) and Ce0.8Sm0.2O2−δ (SDC) have
been explored for use in SOFCs and the results of electrochemical
testing indicated the electron-blocking ability of the BZCY layer
in the fuel cell. Prior work on composite systems has focused on a
few material combinations such as BaCe0.8Y0.2O3−δ–Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9, BaCe0.8Y0.2O3−δ–SDC, and BaCe0.8Sm0.2O3−δ (BCS)–SDC. It was demonstrated that the double-matrix structure
of BCS–SDC (weight ratio 1:1) could avoid the typical drawbacks
of doped ceria electrolytes. In addition to material combinations
listed above employing oxide ionic conductors, acceptor-doped BaCeO3, which is a mixed proton and oxygen ion conductor, has demonstrated
the ability to block electronic conduction and protect doped ceria
from reduction.8,9 It was found that the electron-blocking
ability of the composite was highly dependent on the amount of BaCeO3 and increased with increasing BaCeO3 content.

The function of the cathode in SOFCs is to provide reaction sites
to reduce oxygen molecules to oxygen anions; this reaction typically
has a high activation energy and dominates overall performance characteristics
of SOFCs. A significant number of cathode materials have been evaluated
on doped ceria electrolytes, including perovskite-type La1–xSrxMnO3−δ,10 La1–xSrxCo1–yFeyO3−δ,11 Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ,12 layered double perovskite,13 as well as Ruddlesden–Popper-type materials.14,15 Although some of these cathode materials show high oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) activity at intermediate temperatures, the performance
has not been fully optimized. As a result, extensive contemporary
efforts have been devoted to developing new catalyst materials with
varied infiltration approaches to enhance the performance of existing
SOFC cathodes and evaluate their long-term durability.16−18

Prior works on composite electrolytes have focused on ionic
conductivity
contributions at the interface because of redistribution of ions in
the space-charge regions.19−22 However, the effect of a heterostructured electrolyte
on the cathode electrochemical performance has not been reported to
date. In this work, we report a novel method to improve the cathode
performance by the formation of a well-dispersed barium cerate phase
in a doped ceria electrolyte. The resulting material was tested as
an electrolyte using La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ (LSCF) as a cathode,
resulting in a dramatic reduction to the polarization resistance of
more than half the value (600 and 700 °C, the resistance was
reduced from 2.49 and 0.23 to 1.21 and 0.12 Ω cm2) obtained by using pure Gd0.2Ce0.8O2−δ (GDC) as an electrolyte. In addition, the heterostructured ceria
electrolyte exhibited good long-term stability in full cell operating
conditions.

Results and Discussion
BCG Phase Formation and Sintering Behavior
Figure 1a–c
shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for a pure GDC pellet sintered
at 1500 °C exhibiting the fluorite structure. However, when mixed
with 5 or 10 wt % BaCO3 and sintered at 1500 °C for
5 h, additional peaks appear in the spectra, which are consistent
with a BaCeO3-based perovskite structure. Additional details
of the reaction process were sought at a higher BaCO3 mixture
content. Figure 1d–I
shows the XRD spectra of GDC/BaCO3 mixed in an 88.14:100
weight ratio (50:50 in mol ratio) at temperatures from 800 to 1500
°C. A reaction initiates at temperatures near 1000 °C, whereas
below 900 °C the materials retain their original structure. Although
bulk phases have not been synthesized and characterized, it has been
reported that Ba vapor could react with doped ceria electrolytes to
form a Ba cerate thin film.23,24 This work extends the
solid–vapor reaction data to bulk reactions, indicating that
a perovskite phase of the BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3−δ (BCG) forms during the sintering process according
to (Gd0.2Ce0.8O2−δ +
BaCO3 → BCG + CO2). The resulting heterostructured
electrolyte retains the original phase assemblage after extended heat
treatments at 1500 °C as shown in Figure 1d.

5BCG–GDC (5% BaCO3), and (c) pure GDC pellets sintered
at 1500 °C for 5 h. GDC–BaCO3 composite powder
(mole ratio of 50:50) calcined at (d–g) 1500, 1000, 900, and
800 °C respectively, (h) pure GDC powder, and (i) pure BaCO3 powder.

The reaction processes
between BaCO3 and GDC were investigated
using thermal gravitational measurement by recording the weight change
during the heating process. As shown in Figure 2a, the weight loss of GDC from 30 to 1500
°C was about 3.5%. In contract, the weight loss for GDC with
5 wt % BaCO3 was close to 5%. The higher weight loss of
BaCO3–GDC is due to the additional weight loss of
CO2 44.01/197.35 × 5% = 1.16%. Another important factor
for processing GDC and BaCO3–GDC composites is the
sintering behavior. The sintering curves of GDC and GDC with 5 wt
% BaCO3 are shown in Figure 2b. It is seen that both materials have similar sintering
activity, exhibiting a relativity density increase at 800 °C
with complete densification near 100% density achieved at temperatures
near 1500 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for GDC
and 5BCG–GDC are shown in Figure 2c–d, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
mapping images for Ce, Gd, and O are presented in Figure S1. It was found that the materials were fully dense
and that the grain size was enhanced by BaCO3 addition.
The mean grain size of 5BCG–GDC was 0.5 μm, whereas it
was 3.46 times larger at 2.23 μm for 5BCG–GDC. The enhanced
grain growth may be due to evolved CO2 at 1000 °C
during the sintering process in the 5BCG–GDC samples.

(c,d) GDC-Ba electrolytes sintered at 1500 °C for 5 h.

Ionic Conductivity of GDC
and 5/10BCG–GDC Electrolytes
The ionic conductivities
of GDC, 5BCG–GDC, and 10BCG–GDC
are shown in Figure 3a. At 600 °C, the conductivity of GDC was 0.029 S cm–1, which is consistent with the reported value.2,25 The
conductivity decreased to 0.025 S cm–1 for 5BCG–GDC
and further to 0.021 S cm–1 for 10BCG–GDC.
Over the temperature range from 500 to 700 °C, the samples exhibit
the same trend. Literature values for the oxygen ionic conductivity
of BCG are 0.012 and 0.023 S cm–1 at 600 and 700
°C,26−28 respectively, which are much lower than those of
GDC. Therefore, the reduction in conductivity of composite 5BCG–GDC
samples may be due to increased BCG content. The grain conductivity
and grain boundary conductivity were examined from fits of the impedance
spectra at 400 °C as shown in Figure 3b. At 400 °C, the grain and grain boundary
conductivity of GDC was 1.87 × 10–4 and 7.02
× 10–4 S cm–1, respectively.
For the 5BCG–GDC sample, the values were 2.23 × 10–4 and 6.35 × 10–4 S cm–1 as shown in Figure 3c. The decrease of grain boundary conductivity in heterostructured
samples may be attributed to the nature of the interface between GDC
and BCG and the increased grain size resulting in less interfacial
contributions.

electrolytes, (b) impedance spectra, and (c) contribution of grain
and grain-boundary conductivity at 400 °C.

LSCF Cathode Performance in GDC and 5/10BCG–GDC Electrolytes
The conductivity experiments outlined above indicated only a slight
decrease in the level of oxygen ion conductivity in 5BCG–GDC
and 10BCG–GDC as compared to the baseline GDC electrolyte.
In order to examine the polarization resistance properties of interest
for fuel cell applications, an LSCF cathode was used to fabricate
and test symmetrical cells. Figure 4 summarizes the effect of the BCG phase in the GDC
electrolyte on the LSCF electrode area specific resistance (ASR),
which is determined from the ac impedance spectra. Figure S2 displays the cross section of the LSCF electrode
on all electrolytes, which shows a similar morphology. The resistance
of the LSCF electrode in 5BCG–GDC and 10BCG–GDC electrolytes
was found to be half the value of that of LSCF/GDC electrolytes. For
example, at 700 and 600 °C (Figure 4a,b), the LSCF electrode exhibits an ASR
of 0.23 and 2.5 Ω cm2 on pure GDC electrolytes, which
is consistent with previously reported values.29,30 The values observed in this work were 0.13, 1.21 and 0.18, 0.96
Ω cm2 on 5BCG–GDC and 10BCG–GDC electrolytes,
respectively. Bode plots (Figure S3) indicate
that the reduced resistance is attributed to greatly reduced low-frequency
resistance (around 10 Hz at 600 °C) that is associated with charge
transfer from the LSCF electrode to the electrolyte.31−33Figure 4c displays
the activation energy which was observed to decrease from 1.69 eV
in GDC to 1.65 eV in 5BCG–GDC and further to 1.43 eV in the
10BCG–GDC electrolyte system.

Figure 4 (a,b) Impedance spectra of the LSCF cathode
in GDC, 5BCG–GDC,
and 10BCG–GDC electrolytes at 700 and 600 °C and (c) area
specific polarization resistance (ASR) of the LSCF electrode on GDC,
5BCG–GDC, and 10BCG–GDC from 500 to 700 °C.

A comparison of the heterostructured
electrolytes indicate that
the 5BCG–GDC electrolyte was more suitable for application
in full cell SOFC because of the higher ionic conductivity and smaller
polarization resistance. In further work, La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ (LSM), LSC, and Ag were also employed to
evaluate the cathode performance on GDC and 5BCG–GDC electrolytes.
These three materials stand for electronic conductor, mixed conductor,
and precious metal as cathode. Figure 5a–c shows the typical impedance spectra measured
at 700 °C with symmetrical cells for LSM, LSC, and Ag electrodes.
At 700 °C, the area specific resistance (ASR) shows that the
ASR of LSM, LSC, and Ag on GDC was 20.6, 1.22, and 0.95 Ω cm2, whereas it was 4.6, 1.13, and 0.39 Ω cm2 in 5BCG–GDC, respectively. The morphology of all three electrodes
on GDC and 5BCG–GDC electrolytes is shown in Figure S2. The ASR value for the LSM electrode exhibited the
greatest decrease on 5BCG–GDC electrolytes as shown in Figure 5d. However, all the
cathodes utilized exhibited improved cathode performance when using
the 5BCG–GDC electrolyte as compared to pure GDC.

3D Microstructure of 5BCG–GDC Electrolytes
The
SEM–EDX spectroscopy images of GDC and 5BCG–GDC are
shown in Figure 6a.
In the cross section, we can find that the Ba elemental edge in the
EDX-mapping is evenly distributed throughout the cross section. On
the basis of the observed the Ba elemental distribution and the amount
of BaCO3 added as weight percent in the matrix (volume
fraction 6.25%), it appears that the BCG phase is evenly distributed
throughout the bulk of the material. In the heterostructured electrolyte,
the BCG phase appears as isolated grains as shown in Figure 6b. The BCG grain size ranged
from 0.64 to 1.22 μm and the highest distribution density of
BCG (0.74 μm grain size) was 2.28 μm–1.

(b) 3D distribution image of the BCG phase in the GDC matrix, and
(c) grain size distribution of the BCG phase.

Although the electrolyte is often not considered in the elementary
steps of electrode modeling, it has been found experimentally that
the polarization resistance increases with the increase of electrolyte
resistivity.34−36 Kenjo et al. have proposed that the electrolyte effect
is caused by the locally variable polarization resistance of the electrode.37 However, this is contradictory to our result
that lower electrolyte conductivity accompanies better interfacial
electrochemical performance. Wang et al. measured the polarization
resistance of the LSCF cathode on different ratios of Sm-doped ceria
electrolytes and indicated that polarization resistance and the conductivity
do not follow a linear relationship in doped ceria because the ORR
in the cathode contains several discrete steps.36 This work also provides evidence that in certain cases,
the cathode performance could be improved, even with lower ionic conductivity
levels for a doped ceria electrolyte.

In a mixed conductor such
as LSCF used as a cathode, the cathodic
reaction area would be extended to the entire surface, as shown in Figure 7. In the LSCF frame,
oxygen is reduced to oxygen ion (O2 + 4e– = 2O2–), followed by oxygen ion incorporation
into the GDC electrolyte. In the present work employing LSCF electrodes,
the enhanced performance must be attributed to the interface between
the LSCF and 5BCG–GDC electrolyte. In heterostructured electrolytes,
the oxygen incorporation reaction in LSCF and the 5BCG–GDC
interface would be divided into two sections: (i) the GDC grain and
(ii) the BCG grain. In this work, all measurements were conducted
in dry air atmosphere (no water), resulting in exclusive oxygen ion
conductivity for the BCG phase. However, when we consider that the
volume fraction of the BCG phase is only about 6.25% (limited BCG
grains on the surface) the properties of BCG by itself could not be
responsible for the observed reduction in polarization resistance.
It is proposed that there is a synergistic effect of the BCG phase
on the ORR between the LSCF electrode and the main electrolyte component
GDC. As proposed by Hu et al.,38 the effective
oxygen diffusion distance on the LSCF–GDC interface triple
phase boundary is about 1.5 μm and the diffusion step is known
to dominate the oxygen incorporation reaction. The behavior observed
in the present work may be due to the enlarged effective diffusion
distance created by the BCG phase in the heterostructured 5BCG–GDC
electrolyte, which facilitates the oxygen incorporation process. Further
work needs to be done to confirm this hypothesis and investigate the
effective oxygen diffusion distance in the BCG–GDC electrolyte.

electrolyte.

Full Cell Performance and
Long-Term Stability
The full
cell SOFC performance was evaluated for a 5BCG–GDC electrolyte
full cell with an LSCF cathode. Figure 8a shows the cell voltage and power density from 500
to 650 °C as a function of current density when humidified hydrogen
was used as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant. The peak power
densities at 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C were 0.20, 0.35, 0.53,
and 0.70 W cm–2, respectively. Figure 8b presents long-term stability
tests where the full cell was run at a constant voltage of 0.7 V at
600 °C for 100 h and the current density was recorded as a function
of time. The current density remained constant at about 0.44 A cm–2, and there was no observed degradation in the 100
h test. The impedance spectra measured under open-circuit conditions
are also displayed in Figure 8b, indicating the 5BCG–GDC electrolyte resistance was
0.3 Ω cm2, whereas the polarization resistance of
the LSCF cathode was 0.44 Ω cm2.

It is known that barium cerate-based electrolytes display
poor
chemical stability in the presence of acidic gases such as CO2 in air.39,40 In the typical full cell operating
conditions, CO2 reacts with alkaline metals in barium cerates
and forms carbonates, as predicted from thermodynamic calculations
and widely observed in experiments.41−43 A single cell SOFC fabricated
with BCS electrolytes was shown to react with CO2 in air,
resulting in serious decomposition of the BCS electrolyte in just
24 h under working condition.41 Therefore,
the stability of the BCG phase in the 5BCG–GDC heterostructured
electrolyte is a very important factor for the SOFC applications.
The morphology of the full cell after 100 h of operation is shown
in Figure 9. It is
clear that the surfaced and cross-sectional microstructure of the
5BCG–GDC thin film electrolyte surface exposed to air (the
cathode side) retained a fine grain structure. This is in contract
to coarse grains observed on the surface in pure barium cerate electrolytes.41 The backscatter SEM image and EDX elemental
mapping for cells after 100 h of operation were collected and are
displayed in Figure 9c. There is no sign of coarsening or phase separation within the
electrolyte bulk and the electrolyte morphology of the tested cell
appears identical to an unused/pristine cell. The interfaces between
cathode/anode and electrolyte are very clear and uniform for all elements.
It has been reported that the carbonation process can degrade the
perovskite structure, produce defects such as holes on the surface,
and finally decrease the electrolyte performance.44,45 After 100 h of operation, the Ba element representing the BCG phase
appears to be isolated, indicating no significant elemental migration
and segregation, which suggests excellent chemical stability of the
heterostructured 5BCG–GDC electrolyte.

Conclusions
Barium
carbonate was added to ceria electrolytes to improve the
electrochemical performance in SOFCs. The addition of 5 or 10 wt %
BaCO3 resulted in a reaction with GDC at 1000 °C for
a new BCG phase. In this new BCG–GDC heterostructured electrolyte,
the BCG phase was observed to improve the sintering activity of GDC.
The BCG–GDC electrolyte was tested using LSCF, LSM, LSC, and
Ag as a cathode, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the polarization
resistance (for LSCF at 600 and 700 °C, the resistance was reduced
from 2.49 and 0.23 to 1.21 and 0.12 Ω cm2) obtained
by using pure GDC as an electrolyte. In full cell long-term operation,
the 5BCG–GDC electrolyte was found to be stable in air atmosphere
and no reaction was observed with residual CO2. This approach
of tailoring the surface reactivity by tailoring the composition and
structure of the electrolyte as opposed to electrode materials proved
to be an effective and novel method to improve fuel cell performance.

Methods
and Materials
Sample Preparation
(Gd0.2Ce0.8O2−δ) GDC powder (Fuelcell
Materials Company
Co. Ltd.) was mixed with 5 and 10 wt % barium carbonate followed by
ball milling in ethanol for 24 h. Dense cylindrical GDC and BaCO3–GDC pellets were prepared by uniaxially pressing these
powders followed by sintering at 1500 °C for 5 h. To evaluate
the interfacial polarization resistance, symmetric cells with LSCF,
LSM, LSC, and Ag (Advanced Materials Company Co. Ltd.) cathodes were
fabricated on both sides of the GDC electrolytes. The LSCF, LSM, LSC,
and Ag slurries were prepared by mixing the powders with an organic
binder (Heraeus Co. Ltd.) and heated at 1000, 1000, 900, and 800 °C
for 2 h to form the symmetrical cells.

Full cells were fabricated
with the configuration of NiO–GDC anode substrates and 5BCG–GDC
electrolytes. The anode powders consisting of 60 wt % NiO and 40 wt
% GDC were dry pressed at 200 MPa with starch as a pore former. The
5BCG–GDC electrolyte layers were deposited on the anode support
by the dip-coating process and were then sintered at 1500 °C
for 5 h. The LSCF cathode was applied on the electrolytes by the same
procedure used in symmetrical cell fabrication.

Sample Characterization
XRD (Rigaku TTR-III) analysis
was used to examine the phase of the GDC, BCG, and BaCO3 at the scan rate of 1° per min. The morphologies of the LSCF,
LSM, and LSC electrodes were examined using an SEM (Hitachi S-4800).
EDX spectroscopy was measured on the full cell cross section (sealed
in synthetic resin and polished by sand papers) by an energy-dispersive
spectrometer (Oxford) at the voltage of 20 kV. Thermal gravitation
(METTLER TOLEDO) was employed to analyze the barium acetate decomposition
process. The sinter curves of GDC and 5BCG–GDC were determined
by using a dilatometer (NETZSCH DIL402C) at a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
The 3D distribution of the BCG particles was reconstructed from the
SEM–EDX images, using the two-point correlation function principles
developed by Jiao et al.22 Then, the distribution
of the diameter of BCG particles was calculated from the 3D reconstructed
network of BCG particles, represented by the diameters of the inscribed
spheres.

Electrochemical Testing
Impedance spectra were acquired
using a Solartron 1287 + 1260 electrochemical workstation with an
ac amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz
using Ag as the current collector and were fitted using Zview software.
The performance of the single cell was evaluated using humidified
(∼3% H2O) hydrogen as the fuel and ambient air as
the oxidant.
