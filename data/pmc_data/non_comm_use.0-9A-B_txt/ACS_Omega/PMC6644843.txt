1,2,4-Trisubstituted-(1H)-imidazoles have been
synthesized by the Cu(OTf)2- and I2-catalyzed
unusual C–C bond cleavage of chalcones and benzylamines. After
the α,β-unsaturated C–C bond cleavage, the β-portion
is eliminated from the reaction. Various aryl- and heteroaryl-substituted
chalcones and benzylamines were well tolerated in this unusual transformation
to yield the trisubstituted-(1H)-imidazoles.

Introduction
Chalcone, a naturally
available α,β-unsaturated ketone,1 is well-known for its broad spectrum of medicinal
values.1−7 The researchers are always curious in the structural modification
and utilization of chalcones in the discovery of new active pharmaceutical
ingredients.8 It may be attributed to their
abundance in the natural resources and the ease at which these molecules
can be synthesized.1 In many instances,
quantitative structure–activity relationship studies revealed
that the modified chalcones have led to the improved activity as well
as the exhibition of an entirely new biological property.9 Besides, the presence of enone functionality
always makes it a better precursor for an array of chemical reactions1,10 The 1,4-Michael addition of chalcones with a variety of nucleophiles
is very well reported.11 Cycloaddition
such as 4 + 2,12 3 + 2,13 and 4 + 1 annulations14 has
been reported with the enone system in the divergent synthesis of
heterocycles and highly substituted arenes.15 Alongside, the CH activation reaction16 and numerous Lewis acid catalyzed transformations have also been
reported.17 In 2015, Zhu et al. demonstrated
a facile FeCl3–I2-catalyzed coupling
of amidines with chalcone in the successful preparation of tetrasubstituted
imidazoles (Scheme 1).18

Scheme 1 Chalcone-Based Imidazole Synthesis
In addition, the biological19,20 and material and polymeric21−24 significances of imidazole are also well studied.
Because of the
significant applications, several classical methods for the synthesis
of imidazole are available.25 A series
of metal-catalyzed26 and nonmetal-catalyzed27 multicomponent reactions have also been reported
in the recent years. Accordingly, we envisaged that the development
of a new and simple strategy using readily available chalcones and
benzylamines, which use inexpensive catalysts for the construction
of 1,2,4-trisubstituted-(1H)-imidazoles, would be
a valuable contribution to a limited number of existing approaches
(Scheme 1).

The
perspective of the protocol lies in its practical utilization
of medicinal chemistry approaches, viz., scaffold hopping, molecular
hybridization,28 and so forth. Hit selection
and lead generation are crucial to the success of lead optimization
phase in drug discovery. Chalcones are considered to be one of the
prioritized hits for lead generation in many therapeutic applications.
Hence, the present protocol is an ideal one for the synthesis of 1,2,4-trisubstituted-(1H)-imidazole-appended hybrids from biologically relevant
chalcones (Scheme 2). For instance, isobavachalcone,29 xanthohumol,30 phlorizin,31 macdentichalcone,32 cochinchinenin,33 and so forth are complex natural product chalcones, which display
a broad spectrum of medicinal properties that can be adopted for this
methodology to synthesize a diverse array of imidazole hybrids.

of Biologically Relevant Complex Natural Product-Based Chalcones to
Imidazole Hybrids
Results and Discussion
A few reports on the reactivity
of copper catalyst and iodine26a,27a,34 for the synthesis of imidazoles
have prompted us to examine this catalytic system. Our initial experiment
was conducted between chalcone (1a, 0.24 mmol) and benzylamine
(2a, 1.2 mmol) in the presence of 20 mol % of both copper
acetate and iodine in dichloroethane (DCE) at 50 °C. As expected,
a new product is formed and isolated after 24 h of reaction in 42%
yield. Interestingly, the mass spectrometric analysis showed the high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) peak at lower mass than the expected. Further
structure elucidation of NMR spectra revealed the product as 1-benzyl-2,4-diphenyl-1H-imidazole (Scheme 3). From the NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis, and the products
formed from various substituted chalcones, it has been confirmed that
the β-portion of the α,β-unsaturated ketone coming
from aldehyde has been eliminated from the reaction, which reveals
that the reaction may be going through the unusual C–C bond
cleavage of chalcones. Further, the structure of the product is unambiguously
confirmed from single-crystal X-ray analysis of the molecule 3a (Scheme 3, 3a). Inspired by this Cu(OAc)2- and I2-catalyzed unusual C–C bond cleavage, we started our
investigation in order to optimize the process (Table 1). In the solvent optimization of polar and
nonpolar solvents, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and EtOH yielded the
product in trace quantity, whereas tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylformamide
(DMF) could not furnish the desired outcome. The reaction in acetonitrile
afforded a comparatively less yield (36%). Toluene produced an improved
yield of 48% in comparison with other solvents. Further, we tested
the reaction using different copper(II) catalysts. Among those, CuCl2 and Cu(BF4)2 did not show any promising
improvement. CuI or CuBr also failed to show the significant result.
A comparatively higher yield of 52% is afforded with Cu(OTf)2 than with Cu(OAc)2. Because copper triflate is a Lewis
acid, we explored the catalytic reactivity of Sc(OTf)3,
Zn(OTf)3, La(OTf)3, and so forth. However, the
reaction did not afford the expected product.

inert atmosphere, for 24 h.

b Reaction time: 14 h.

c In
the presence of argon atmosphere.

d 1a (0.24 mmol), 2a (0.72 mmol).

Different oxidants, viz., TBHP,
I2, PhIOAc2, H2O2, and
O2, were also added
as an additive to improve the yields further. Except for I2, none of the other additives produced the desired product. Hence,
Cu(OTf)2 and I2 together have been used as the
catalyst for the reaction. A decrease in the loading of Cu(OTf)2 to 10 mol % at 50 °C increased the yield to 60%. Hence,
10 mol % Cu(OTf)2 and 20 mol % I2 are together
considered as the catalytic system for the reaction. When 50 and 100
mol % of iodine are used, the yield has been suppressed to 38 and
31%, respectively. When the temperature of the reaction increased
to 70 °C from 50 °C, the reaction proceeded comparatively
clean without much change in the yield. Hence, 70 °C has been
considered as the optimized temperature for the reaction. When we
carried out the reaction in the presence of argon atmosphere, the
reaction did not produce the expected product in the desired yield.
The other parameters considered for the optimization are tabulated
in Table 1.

The
generality of the reaction is investigated by the reaction
of various substituted chalcones with substituted benzylamines under
the optimized condition (Scheme 3). The reaction proceeds smoothly for all the electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing substitutions on chalcone. The reaction is
also generalized for 2-thiophene, 3-thiophene chalcones, and phenanthrene
chalcones, which gave satisfactory yields. Therefore, for all the
various substituents of chalcones with benzylamine, good-to-moderate
yields have been obtained without the significant impact of the substitution
(Scheme 3). However,
comparatively higher yields have been received for the benzylamines
with electron-donating groups than that with electron-withdrawing
groups. The results are summarized in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Scope of the Reaction for Substituted Benzylamines
Because 2 mol of benzylamine
is taking part in the reaction, we
emphasized the idea of utilizing the two differently substituted benzylamines
in a one-pot reaction. To our delight, the one-pot reaction through
the monitored sequential addition of chalcone, (4-methoxyphenyl) methenamine,
and p-tolylmethanamine gave four various substituted
products as shown in Scheme 5. Hence, the protocol provides an opportunity to synthesize
the library of highly substituted imidazoles in a controlled one-pot
manner. Toward the demonstration of scale-up synthesis of imidazoles
from chalcones and benzylamines under the optimized reaction condition
was performed with 1 g of chalcone and 2.39 g of benzylamine. We have
successfully obtained the corresponding imidazole in 54% yield (754
mg) (Scheme 6). This
shows that the protocol is well optimized even for carrying out the
gram-scale synthesis of imidazole derivatives for various applications.

Scheme 5 Imidazole Synthesis with Two Different Substituted Benzylamines
Scheme 6 Gram-Scale Synthesis of Imidazole
from (E)-Chalcone
and Benzylamine
To gain some insights
into this unusual C–C bond cleavage
of chalcones leading to the imidazole formation, we have carried out
some controlled experiments. The yield did not decrease when a radical
scavenger (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl (TEMPO) was
added to the reaction; thus, a radical process is probably unlikely
to be involved (Scheme 7, exp 1). Anticipating a cleavage of chalcone, subsequent transformation
to phenylglyoxal, and its involvement in the product formation, we
conducted an experiment with phenylglyoxal and 4-methoxy-benzylamine
under the optimized reaction condition. However, the reaction afforded
the desired product in very less amount even after 24 h, which indicates
that the reaction is not going through phenylglyoxal (Scheme 7, exp 2) as the intermediate.
Further, we have conducted three experiments with 1 equiv, 2 equiv,
and 4 equiv of benzylamines, respectively. The HRMS of each reaction
was analyzed at different time intervals to identify the intermediates
formed. According to the controlled experiments and the HRMS analysis
of a reaction mixture with 1 equiv of benzylamine (after 1 h) (Figures 1, S1, and S4, Supporting Information), we have proposed a plausible
mechanism (Scheme 8).

Figure 1 HRMS for the reaction mixture of 1 equiv of benzylamine and chalcone
after 1 h of the reaction time.

Scheme 7 Controlled Experiments
Scheme 8 Plausible Mechanism of the Reaction
In the presence of copper triflate, benzylamine reacts
with chalcone
to form the corresponding imine [(M + H)+ = 312.1704],
followed by the reaction of iodine to the corresponding imine to form
an iodonium ion intermediate B. Addition of amine to imine, followed
by rearrangement, leads to the intermediate C, which on air oxidation
gives D [(M + H)+ = 415.2115]. Further, iodonium ion formation
and intramolecular cyclization of E provide the intermediate F. Nucleophilic
substitution on F from benzylamine gives the intermediate G. Finally,
imine formation and subsequent C–C bond cleavage of G lead
to an aromatized product of 1,2,4-trisubstituted-(1H)-imidazoles.

Conclusions
In summary, a new and
simple route for the synthesis of 1,2,4-trisubstituted-(1H)-imidazoles via Cu(OTf)2-/I2-catalyzed
unusual C–C bond cleavage of chalcones and benzylamines is
developed. The reaction tolerates a wide range of functional groups
to produce the products in good-to-moderate yields. The plausible
mechanism of this unusual C–C bond cleavage and imidazole formation
was hypothesized through controlled experiments and HRMS analysis.
Hence, the methodology can be utilized in medicinal chemistry approaches,
such as scaffold hopping, molecular hybridization, and so forth for
the selective synthesis of imidazole-appended hybrids from bioactive
chalcones.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All the reactions
were performed with
commercially available best grade chemicals without further purification.
All the solvents used were of reagent grade, column chromatography
was performed using 100–200 mesh silica gel, and mixtures of
hexane–ethyl acetate were used for elution of the products.
Melting points were determined on a Büchi melting point apparatus
and are uncorrected. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrophotometer
(CDCl3 as the solvent). The chemical shifts for 1H NMR spectra are reported as δ in units of parts per million
(ppm) downfield from SiMe4 (δ 0.0) and relative to
the signal of chloroform-d (δ 7.25, singlet).
Multiplicities were given as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet),
q (quartet), dd (double doublet), and m (multiplet). The coupling
constants are reported as J value in hertz. The carbon
NMR (13C NMR) spectra are reported as δ in units
of ppm downfield from SiMe4 (δ 0.0) and relative
to the signal of chloroform-d (δ 77.03, triplet).
The mass spectra were recorded under EI/HRMS at 60,000 resolution
using a Thermo Scientific Exactive mass spectrometer. The IR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker FT-IR spectrometer. All the substituted
chalcones were synthesized using literature reports.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of (E)-Chalcone35
One equivalent of arylaldehyde or heteroarylaldehyde
was added to the solution of 1 equiv of acetophenone in ethanol. The
10% aqueous solution of NaOH was added dropwise to the mixture at
0 °C, which resulted in precipitation. The mixture was then stirred
for 30 min, filtered, washed with cold methanol, and dried to yield
60–90% solid compound. The product was confirmed from 1H NMR.
