Pt(II)-based
derivatives bearing a cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) unit
were synthesized in aqueous solutions, and the reaction mixtures were
examined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with electrospray
ionization and linear ion trap mass spectrometry (MS). Isotopic pattern
analysis, multistage mass-spectra (MS/MS and MS3) interpretation,
and differential isotopic labeling were used to establish the chemical
composition and to suggest the chemical structures of reaction products.
When cisplatin (cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2]) was used as a Pt(II) drug derivative, a coordination
bond between diamminemonochloroplatinum(II) and the cyano group of
CNCbl, in turn linked covalently to the vitamin Co(III) ion, occurred.
The resulting conjugate with a CoIII–CN–PtII bridge was MS detected as a doubly positive charged ion
with the prevailing isotopologue at m/z 810.26 (empirical formula [C63H95ClCoIIIN16O14PPt]2+). Likewise,
a peak signal centered at m/z 811.26
was observed when 15N-labeled cisplatin cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2] was
used as Pt(II) complex, thus confirming the presence of both the cisplatin
amino groups in the conjugate. A bifunctional conjugate was obtained
between CNCbl and the cis-diamminediaquaplatinum(II),
that is, cis-[Pt(NH3)2(H2O)2]2+; in this case, the planar coordination
complex of Pt(II) was also involved in a covalent bond with the oxygen
atom of one of the CNCbl amide moieties. The peak signal detected
at m/z 792.26 (empirical formula
[C63H94CoIIIN16O14PPt]2+) changed to m/z 793.26 when the labeled cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ complex
was adopted for conjugation. Comparison between MS/MS spectra allowed
an extended structural characterization of both conjugates, as such
or 15N-labeled. Two-dimensional heteronuclear (1H–15N) single quantum correlation NMR spectroscopy,
applied to 15N-labeled conjugates, supported the hypotheses
made on the Pt(II) coordination in both cases.

==== Body
Introduction
Cisplatin (CP), cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II),
is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of human
malignancies but exhibits low selectivity for tumor tissue, which
leads to severe side effects.1,2 Continuing research
is uncovering new beneficial forms of platinum-based drugs,3,4 leading to so-called prodrugs.4,5 Cyanocobalamin (CNCbl
or vitamin B12) uptake in mammalian cells is mediated by
specific, high-affinity receptors that are overexpressed in numerous
human tumors.6 The affinity of CNCbl conjugates
for such receptors remains high enough, and rapidly proliferating
tumor cells ask for increased supply of nutrients, including CNCbl.
As a consequence, CNCbl–CP conjugates can be considered interesting
candidates as Pt(II)-based prodrugs. Cellular uptake of CNCbl–CP
conjugates is typically followed via detection of their metal constituents
by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS), a
powerful technique that, however, lacks speciation capability.7,8 Investigation of prodrug metabolism would further benefit from information
at molecular level that can be gathered by, for example, soft-ionization
MS techniques. Indeed, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
(MALDI)–MS has been recently proposed for the structural characterization
of CNCbl and CNCbl–Pt(II) species (e.g., CP and oxaliplatin)
conjugates.9 Using a second-generation
MALDI matrix, it was demonstrated that CNCbl–CP gives rise
to a single conjugate involving a CN bridge between Co(III) and Pt(II),
whereas two conjugates were obtained for oxaliplatin, differing from
CP for the replacement of the two amine and both Cl– ligands by the bidentate ligands 1,2-diaminocyclohexane and oxalate,
respectively.

Cyanocobalamin’s structure comprises a
mid-planar corrin
ring composed of four pyrroline rings linked to a central Co(III)
ion. CNCbl is essential for the survival of all living organisms playing
a key role in the hematopoiesis, neural metabolism, DNA and RNA production,
and carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism.10,11 More than 10 years ago, Alberto and co-workers proposed the idea
to use CNCbl as a carrier of CP;12−14 it was shown that CNCbl
can act as a ligand for CP by formation of a cyanide bridged species
between the β-axial ligand of CNCbl and the square-planar platinum
complex.12 The CNCbl–CP conjugate
retains a labile chloride ligand that can be exchanged within cells,
allowing the conjugate to behave in a comparable way to CP. Preliminary
results showed a lower activity (IC50 between 8 and 88
μM) than for CP alone, possibly because of limited CNCbl uptake
capacity. Because platinum-based drugs interact with DNA2 and many other biomolecules,15−17 a full understanding
of their modes of action requires the knowledge of all species formed
during the reaction process of CP and CNCbl. Yet, few detailed mechanistic
studies have been performed on such interactions, in comparison to
studies with nucleobases. Accordingly, understanding the binding mechanism
of CP to CNCbl is of highest importance for the development of refined
therapeutic approaches of drug delivery. Several analytical techniques
are currently available for monitoring CP uptake and formation of
Pt–DNA adducts in biological samples, mostly relying on ICP–MS.7,18 Concomitantly, good sensitivity and excellent selectivity is required
to advance the understanding of drug Pt-based cytotoxicities and to
further elucidate the cell uptake, resistance, and treatment monitoring.

Soft ionization MS techniques, such as electrospray ionization
(ESI), which contrary to MALDI can be easily coupled on-line to liquid
chromatography (LC), deserve further investigation, aimed at analyzing
platinum prodrugs metabolism in complex biological fluids or tissues.
Although LC–ESI–MS methods for CNCbl determination in
complex samples (especially foods) have been reported, no study exists
concerning simultaneous determination of CNCbl and CNCbl–Pt(II)
drug conjugates. In the present study, the characterization of two
distinct types of complex [i.e., cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
and its hydrated cis-diammineplatinum(II)] conjugates
with CNCbl is presented, mainly based on reversed-phase LC (RPLC)
coupled with ESI and collision-induced dissociation (CID) multistage
MS. A confirmation of the proposed structures was obtained through
two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation NMR spectroscopy (widely
used in anticancer platinum drugs study19), which also allowed to discern between equivalent structures from
the point of view of the MS and MS/MS spectra. In this synergistic
approach, MS data were used to obtain the elemental composition of
each conjectured adduct; CID–MS/MS spectra collected on isotopically
labeled Pt(II) complexes with 15NH3 ammonia
molecules lead to noticeable benefits for structure determination,
with further refinements by NMR analysis.

Results and Discussion
RPLC–ESI–MS
of CNCbl Reaction Mixtures with CP
or 15N-Labeled-CP
The RPLC–ESI–MS
total ion current chromatograms, referred to the reaction mixtures
containing either CNCbl plus CP (i.e., cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2]) or CNCbl plus hydrated cis-diammineplatinum(II) (i.e., [Pt(NH3)2(H2O)2]2+),20 are reported in plots a and b of Figure 1, respectively. A comparison of the chromatographic
profiles reveals the occurrence of two common peaks, labeled as 1
and 3 (see plots a and b), with retention times 11.6 and 9.3 min,
respectively. The most intense signals of the corresponding ESI–MS
spectra were detected at m/z 678.30
and 792.29 (vide infra). Regarding peak 2, detected
only in plot a and eluting at 9.6 min, the most intense peak of the
isotopic cluster was found at m/z 810.28. Peak 1 was assigned to CNCbl by a standard solution examined
under the same LC–MS conditions as emphasized in Figure S1
(Supporting Information). The major signal
at m/z 678.30 in the ESI–MS
spectrum is was due to a doubly charged ion corresponding to the bis-protonated
form of zwitterionic CNCbl (i.e., [C63H88CoN14O14P + 2H]2+). Two additional ion clusters,
with most intense peaks detected at m/z 689.28 and m/z 697.27, respectively,
were recognized as doubly charged ions resulting from the previous
species through the exchange of a proton with a sodium ([M + H + Na]2+) or a potassium ([M + H + K]2+) cation, respectively
(with M representing zwitterionic CNCbl). Under the present LC–MS
conditions, the peak due to mono-protonated CNCbl ([M + H]+), detected at m/z 1355.57, was
very weak, its relative abundance being ca. 1% of that of the bisprotonated
molecule (see Figure S1). Notably, the
same signal was detected as the most abundant one during a previous
investigation based on MALDI–ToF–MS using 4-chloro-α-cyanocinnamic
acid as a matrix.21

Figure 1 RPLC–ESI(+)–MS
chromatograms related to reaction
mixtures involving CNCbl and: (a) CP; (b) the cis-diamminediaqua-Pt(II) complex. Peaks were identified as follows,
based on MS and/or MSn data: (1) unreacted
CNCbl, detected as doubly charged ion at m/z 678.30 ([C63H88CoN14O14P + 2H]2+); (2) CNCbl–CP conjugate, detected
as doubly charged ion at m/z 810.28;
(3) CNCbl–cis-diamminediaqua-Pt(II) conjugate,
detected as doubly charged ion at m/z 792.29. See text for details on the structure of conjugates.

The major signal (m/z 810.28)
detected in the mass spectrum related to peak 2 of Figure 1a (i.e., the spectrum reported
in Figure 2a) readily
suggested the occurrence of a molecular species containing platinum,
which is characterized by the presence of major natural isotopes 194Pt(32.9), 195Pt(33.8), 196Pt(25.3), 198Pt(7.2), and 192Pt(0.8), here listed in a decreasing
order of percentage abundance (reported in parentheses).22 As apparent in the enlarged view reported in Figure 2a, the isotopic pattern,
dominated by a signal at m/z 810.28,
clearly corresponded to a doubly charged ion and was found to agree
with a simulated spectrum (see Figure 2a inset) based on the empirical formula [C63H95ClCoIIIN16O14PPtII]2+. Obviously, the presence of chloride increases
the  isotopic pattern complexity of the ion cluster centered
at m/z 810.28. When 15N-labeled CP (i.e., cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2]) was incubated with CNCbl, a peak eluting
almost at the same retention time (i.e., 9.6 min) of the unlabeled
adduct was observed. The corresponding ESI–MS spectrum, reported
in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information, exhibited the most intense peak at m/z 811.28 and the related isotopic pattern was in excellent agreement
with the simulated pattern obtained using the empirical formula [C63H95ClCoIII15N2N14O14PPtII]2+, that is, a formula
arising from the previous one upon replacement of two 14N atoms with two 15N ones. This result confirmed that
both amino groups of CP were involved in the structure of the compound
corresponding to peak 2, whose empirical formula agrees with data
of Alberto and co-workers,12,13 and the generation
of a conjugate with CNCbl, likely implying the presence of a Co–CN–Pt
bridge (vide infra).

Figure 2 ESI(+)–MS spectra of the conjugates
formed between CNCbl
and (a) CP; (b) cis-diamminediaqua–Pt(II)
complex, corresponding to peaks (2) and (3) in Figure 1, respectively. Insets show the enlarged
isotopic patterns located at (a) m/z 810.28 and (b) m/z 792.29 compared
with isotopic patterns simulated using the reported empirical formulae
and a resolving power 4000 (see boxed frames). Xcalibur software 2.2
SP1.48 (Thermo Scientific) was used to simulate the isotopic patterns.

Turning to peak 3, detected in
both chromatograms of Figure 1 (although its amount was significantly
different in the two cases), an ion cluster with a major peak at m/z 792.29 was found in the corresponding
ESI–MS spectrum, reported in Figure 2b. The corresponding isotopic pattern was
found to agree with [C63H94CoIIIN16O14PPtII]2+ as empirical
formula (see inset of Figure 2b), in which a different conjugation between CNCbl and cis-diamino-Pt(II) is invoked, with a formal loss of HCl
compared to the conjugate formed between CNCbl and CP. Interestingly,
the isotope pattern related to the main signal detected in the ESI–MS
spectrum of Figure 2b, corresponding to a m/z 664.76
ion, suggests the absence of platinum in the corresponding ion, whose
identity will be discussed below. By analogy with the conjugate eluted
as peak 2, a chromatographic peak at the same retention time as peak
3 in Figure 1 was observed
upon the analysis of a reaction mixture containing CNCbl and the 15N-labeled cis-diammineplatinum(II) complex.
An ion cluster dominated by a m/z 793.29 ion, corresponding to the empirical formula [C63H94CoIII15N2N14O14PPtII]2+, was found in the corresponding
ESI–MS spectrum (see Figure S2b, Supporting Information).

Starting from the outcomes reported so
far, including empirical
formulas, and considering the formation of a CN bridge between CoIII and PtII (i.e., CoIII–CN–PtII) as previously suggested,9,12,13,23,24 the chemical structures proposed for CNCbl–CP conjugates
whose diagnostic ions were detected at m/z 810.3 (structure 1) and 792.3 (structure 2) are depicted,
in a simplified form, in Figure 3, including the corresponding 15N-labeled
conjugates (1′) and (2′). The structures of non-labeled
conjugates are reported in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The experimental m/z values of major peak signals related to unlabeled (m/z 810.28 and m/z 792.29) and 15N-labeled adducts with CNCbl (m/z 811.28 and m/z 793.29, see Figure S2) agreed with the
predicted values of the corresponding ion clusters, viz., 810.2809,
811.2779, 792.2930, and 793.2901, respectively.

Figure 3 Perspective chemical
structures of the conjugates formed by aqueous
reaction of CNCbl with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
(1/1′) and cis-diamminediaquaplatinum(II)
(2/2′). Species labeled as 1′ and 2′ correspond
to conjugates generated using the 15N-labeled platinum
complexes. For the sake of simplicity, the corrin ring of CNCbl has
been schematically drawn as a square with heterocyclic rings interacting
with Co(III) put at its vertices and only two amide arms drawn. For
the same reason, the NL of the vitamin has been represented as an
arc, with the OH group related to the phosphoryl moiety evidenced.

Although there is a good accordance
between structure 1 in Figure 3 and the one proposed
by Ruiz-Sánchez et al.13 for the
CNCbl–CP conjugate, based on X-ray diffraction data, no information
is available in the literature on the occurrence of an additional
conjugate (see structure 2 in Figure 3) detected in the present case, that is, the one lacking
chlorine ([C63H94CoIIIN16O14PPtII]2+). As emphasized by Figure 1, this conjugate
was virtually the only one generated in the reaction mixture when
the hydrated cis-diammineplatinum(II) complex was
used as a CNCbl reagent. This finding supports the hypothesis made
for structure 2. Indeed, the complete lack of chloride ligands in
the reacting Pt(II) complex obviously favors the generation of a Cl-free
conjugate with CNCbl, which in turn enhances the occurrence of two
bonding sites of the planar Pt(II). One of such bonds is still related
to the CN group of CNCbl; the other is reasonably related to one of
the CNCbl amide arms, that is, the deprotonated OH moiety included
in the enol-iminic tautomer of the corresponding amide group (vide infra). Notably, the generation of a Cl-free conjugate
is possible also when CP is used as a conjugation reagent, yet, as
expected, it is much more difficult, because both of the chloride
ligands of CP must be replaced. Compelling evidence is given by the
very low abundance exhibited by peak 3 in Figure 1a.

To obtain a confirmation of the
coordination proposed for the planar
complex of Pt(II) in both conjugates and possibly to attain further
information not available from MS data (i.e., to identify the atom
of the amide moiety involved in the interaction with the platinum
in conjugate 2), two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum correlation
(HSQC)–NMR spectroscopy was used.

NMR Analysis of both CNCbl
and 15N-Labeled CP, and
CNCbl and 15N-Labeled cis-Diammine-Pt(II)
Reaction Mixtures
The reaction between CNCbl and 15N-CP (i.e. cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2]), initially present in a molar ratio 75:1,
was performed in water (pH 5.8) at 60 °C for 16 h and monitored
by 1H–15N-HSQC–NMR experiments
at 37 °C (see Figure 4a). In this case the 15N chemical shifts of amine
ligands of CP, which resonate approximately between −70 and
−90 ppm when 15N is trans to O and between −50
and −70 ppm when 15N is trans to Cl or N,25 were extremely diagnostic. The 1H–15N HSQC spectra of CP, incubated under the same experimental
conditions of the mixture, displayed the signals related to the di-chloro
species (cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2], δ 15N = −67 ppm),
the mono-chloro mono-aqua species (cis-[PtCl(15NH3)2(H2O)]+,
δ 15N = −65 and −88 ppm for the 15NH3 ligand trans to Cl and trans to O, respectively),
the hydrated complex (cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O)2]2+, δ 15N = −84 ppm), and other signals assigned to hydroxo-bridged
complexes.25 After 16 h of reaction with
CNCbl, in addition to the previously described NMR signals, 15N-CP displayed two intense signals, falling in the region of 15N trans to Cl or N (δ 15N = −66 and
−68 ppm) and confidently assigned to the adduct with CNCbl.

Figure 4 Superposition
of 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra,
recorded at 37 °C, obtained for: (a) 3 mM cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2] and
(b) 3 mM cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O) (SO4)] incubated at 60 °C
for 16 h in the absence (red) and in the presence (blue) of 40 μM
CNCbl. Signals providing information on the coordination of the Pt(II)
atom in the conjugates generated upon reaction with CNCbl are linked
by a segment.

The reaction with CNCbl
was also carried out with cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O) (SO4)], which generates
the hydrated species cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ (δ 15N = −84 ppm) after
dissolution, thus mimicking the intracellular active form of the drug.
The presence of residual signals of the mono-chloro mono-aqua ligands
(δ 15N = −65 and −88 ppm) was ascribed
to Cl contamination during the synthesis of the complex. After 16
h of incubation with CNCbl in water (pH 3.6) at 60 °C, new signals
appeared in the 1H–15N-HSQC spectrum
(Figure 4b). The two
most abundant peaks were assigned to 15NH3 ligands
trans to O and trans to N, respectively (δ 15N =
−76 ppm and −61 ppm). This finding strengthened the
hypothesis made on the proximity of an oxygen atom to the Pt(II) one
in the conjugate generated when the cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ complex is reacted with CNCbl.

Structural Characterization
of CNCbl–Pt(II) Conjugates
by CID Tandem MS (CID–MS/MS)
Taking advantage of the
information obtained by MS and NMR analysis, the conjugates formed
between CNCbl and Pt(II) complexes were further investigated by tandem
MS with CID (CID–MS/MS). Figure 5 (plots a–d) shows the MS/MS spectra obtained
for the corresponding precursor ions, including also those related
to 15N-labeled conjugates (thus isotopic patterns centered
on nominal m/z ratios 810, 811,
792, and 793 were considered for MS/MS analyses). Each of the main
product ions detected was carefully evaluated in terms of m/z ratio, charge state, and isotopic pattern,
and the corresponding empirical formula was obtained; then the corresponding
structure or the neutral loss/losses leading to that formula were
assumed. The assignments made at the end of this systematic procedure
for product ions related to both non-15N-labeled conjugates
under study have been summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

Figure 5 ESI–CID–MS/MS
spectra obtained for conjugates formed
through reaction of CNCbl with: (a) cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2] (nominal m/z 810), (b) cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2] (nominal m/z 811), (c) cis-[Pt(NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ (nominal m/z 792), and (d) cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ (nominal m/z 793). The
prevailing peak of each isotope pattern has been labeled with the m/z ratio. A detailed assignment of all
identified peaks is given in Tables 1 and 2. See text for details.

intensities observed in Figure 5 are because of overlapping
of different fragments. Abbreviations: DMB, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole
base (C9H10N2, 146.084 Da); NL, nucleotide
loop (C14H19N2O7P, 358.093
Da).

At a first glance,
several signals related to common product ions
can be observed in the MS/MS spectra of Figure 5 (plots a–d). One of them is detected
at m/z 359.09 and 341.09, clearly
not containing Pt in their structures and easily assigned to the protonated
form of the so-called nucleotide loop (NL) of CNCbl,
that is, of α-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-ribosyl-5′-phosphate
(see Figure S4), and to the ion arising
from it upon water neutral loss, respectively. Among further common
product ions generated in the gas-phase, the doubly charged one detected
at m/z 635.76 for the CNCbl–CP
conjugate can be explained by assuming the neutral losses of an acetamide
radical (•CH2CONH2), from
one of the amide arms of CNCbl, and of the neutral Pt(NH3)2ClCN complex. Although well defined, the loss of the
acetamide radical, clearly leading to radical ions as fragments, was
involved in several fragmentation pathways of the conjugates under
study, as emphasized in Tables 1 and 2. A different pathway had to
be proposed for the m/z 635.72 ion
obtained upon fragmentation of the conjugate formed by CNCbl and the
hydrated cis-diammineplatinum(II) complex. As depicted
in Figure S5, the product ion resulted
from the direct detachment of the Pt(NH3)2CN(O(C=NH)CH2•) neutral complex, implying, once again,
the homolytic cleavage of the bond linking the corrin ring to the
CNCbl amide arm involved in the Pt(II) complexation. In this case
the final double positive charge was located on the Co(III) ion. As
an alternative pathway involving one of the CNCbl amide arms, neutral
acetamide could be lost, through a 1,3-H migration from the corrin
ring toward one of the amide arms, generating a product ion at m/z 635.27 (see Figure 5).

This process was involved also in
the generation of the singly
charged ion detected at m/z 912.43
when the CNCbl–CP conjugate was fragmented. In this case the
acetamide loss was accompanied by the detachment of the singly charged
[Pt(NH3)2Cl]+ complex and, interestingly,
of a CN• radical, with the consequent reduction
of Co(III) to Co(II) (see Table 1). Notably, the existence of this product ion was proved
earlier by MALDI–MS/MS analysis of CNCbl.21 When the conjugate between CNCbl and the hydrated cis-diammineplatinum(II) complex, that is, the right structure
in Figures 3 and S3, was fragmented, both NL and CN• radical losses had still to be invoked to explain the gas-phase
generation of the product ion at m/z 912.44. However, in this case they were accompanied by the loss
of the singly charged [Pt(NH3)2(O(C=NH)CH3)]+ species, that is, a complex in which Pt was
covalently linked to the O atom related to the CNCbl amide arm previously
involved in the conjugation (see structures 2/2′ in Figure 3) and detached from
the corrin ring during the fragmentation process.

A further
interesting product ion was the m/z 911.43–911.44 one, whose abundance was ca. 15%
of that of the m/z 912.43 ion in
the case of the CNCbl–CP conjugates (see Figure 5a,b), whereas it became comparable in the
case of the other two conjugates (see Figure 5c,d). Once again, the structural interpretation
for this product ion was different according to the precursor ion.
In the case of the CNCbl–CP conjugate, an additional loss of
a H• radical, with respect to the pathway leading
to the m/z 912.43 ion, had to be
invoked, thus leading to a radical ion (see Table 1). Not surprisingly, this was a difficult
process, as confirmed by the weak signal detected for the resulting
fragment. When the other conjugate was considered, the pathway involved
losses of both acetamide, NL and [Pt(NH3)2CN]+ ion. As emphasized in Figure S6, no change in oxidation state was required for the Co ion in this
case, yet its residual double positive charge was partly compensated
by the negative charge located on the oxygen atom previously interacting
with Pt(II). The formation of a Co–O covalent bond cannot be
ruled out in this case.

As shown in Figure 5, several signals were detected in the 720–800 m/z range of conjugate MS/MS spectra, and,
again,
part of them were common to both conjugates; moreover, because of
their particular isotope patterns, the signals were related to doubly
charged ions, including the Pt(II). Their generation implied combinations
of processes like the already cited neutral losses of acetamide or
of its radical species along with losses of HCl, NH3, 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole
(DMB), and H2O (from the ribose ring of the NL). For the
sake of example, the pathways leading to product ions at m/z 764.24 and 766.75 from the CNCbl–CP conjugate
have been depicted in Scheme 1, including the simplified structure of a planar Pt(II) conjugate.
As apparent in the lower pathway of the scheme, the HCl loss from
the latter implies the generation of a Pt–O bond like that
hypothesized for the conjugate formed between CNCbl and the hydrated cis-diammineplatinum(II) complex. It is then not surprising
that the m/z 766.75 product ion
was observed also in the MS/MS spectrum of the latter. In the same
pathway of Scheme 1, the loss of a further NH3 molecule besides those interacting
with Pt, from one of the amide arms of CNCbl (with generation of a
ketene), is evidenced.

Scheme 1 Fragmentation Pathways Proposed To Explain
the Generation of Product
Ions at m/z 764.24 and 766.75 from
the Precursor Ion Related to the CNCbl–CP Conjugate, Represented
in the Simplified Version
Note that the same
product ions
could be generated by the 15N-labeled conjugate (corresponding
to structure 1′ in Figure 3), because both of the NH3 ligands of Pt(II)
were lost during the described processes.

As expected (see Scheme 1), fragmentation pathways involving the loss of both of the
NH3 molecules interacting with Pt(II) led to identical
product ions for the nonlabeled and the 15N-labeled conjugate
of the same type, because the 15N atoms were present only
in the two NH3 ligands. Consequently, a systematic comparison
of m/z ratios observed in MS/MS
spectra of Figure 5a/b,c/d enabled a rapid assignment of product ions whose generation
involved the loss of one or both of the NH3 ligands of
Pt(II), always confirming the suggestions made from MS/MS data referred
to non-15N-labeled conjugates.

The last considerations
on MS/MS data are deserved by product ions
with m/z 664.68 and 655.10 (656.11),
detected solely from precursor ions at nominal m/z 810/811 and 792(793), respectively. As emphasized in Scheme
S1 (top) of the Supporting Information,
the first product ion was generated by the loss of the neutral Pt(NH3)2ClCN complex, thus leaving a double positive
charge on the Co(III) atom of CNCbl. At least formally the product
ion can be indicated as a [M–CN]2+, where M represents
the zwitterionic form of CNCbl. The fragmentation pathway leading
to product ion at m/z 655.10 (656.11)
implied the final interaction between the Pt(II) atom and the NL of
CNCbl (see the lower side of Scheme S1).
In addition, a Pt–CN bond was formed, along with the one between
Pt and the O atom of the tautomerized amide group of CNCbl, although
the amide arm interacting with Pt was detached from the corrin ring
of CNCbl. The positive charge of the product ion was thus likely related
to protonation of the benzimidazole, as shown in Scheme S1. A single ammonia ligand remained on the product
ion structure, thus explaining the 1 m/z unit shift observed when the 15N-labeled conjugate was
fragmented.

Finally, the systematic interpretation of MS/MS
data provided a
confirmation of the structures hypothesized for the two conjugates
under study and reported in Figures 3 and S3. Nonetheless, their
structural characterization was completed by considering two of the
already discussed product ions, those at nominal m/z 764 and 766, for MS3 measurements
and is described in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
RPLC–ESI–MS and MSn (with n = 2 or 3) were successfully
applied to establish the chemical
identity of two conjugates formed in aqueous solutions between CP
and CNCbl and hydrated cis-diammineplatinum(II) and
CNCbl. In the former case the generation of a conjugate involving
a chloride ligand loss and a coordination bond between the CN group
of CNCbl and the Pt ion of CP was observed. The lack of chloride ligands
in the cis-diammineplatinum(II) complex led to a
different conjugation, still implying a Pt–CN coordination
bond along with the formation of a covalent Pt–O bond involving
one amide arm of CNCbl. Two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation
NMR spectroscopy, performed on conjugates generated under the same
reaction conditions but using 15N-labeled Pt(II) complexes
as reactants with CNCbl, confirmed the presence of a Cl or an O atom
near the Pt atom in both conjugates, respectively. Given the importance
of prodrugs to overcome CP resistance, the characterization of conjugates
between CNCbl and Pt(II) complexes described here by RPLC–ESI–MS
and MS/MS may represent an important contribution to understand the
chemical structure of expected and even unexpected complexes containing
platinum(II) compounds.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Synthesis
of Pt(II) Complexes
Water and
methanol, both LC–MS grade, and CNCbl and formic acid (reagent
grade) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy). cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2] and cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O)(SO4)] were prepared by a slightly modified literature
procedure.26 Briefly, K2PtCl4 (0.516 mmol) and solid KI (0.720 g, 4.33 mmol) were mixed
in water (2 mL) at 55 °C; in a few minutes the solution turned
from red to brown. 2 mL of a 6.2 mM aqueous solution of ammonium chloride
(or 15NH4Cl, in the case of 15N-labeled
CP synthesis) was neutralized with 2 mL of an aqueous solution of
KOH 6.2 M and added, under stirring, to the previous solution. The
heating was prolonged for 15 min; meanwhile a golden-yellow precipitate
separated out. The solid was collected on a filter glass, washed with
water and ethanol, and then dried in a stream of dry air. The newly
formed cis-[PtI2(15NH3)2] (0.190 g, 0.4 mmol) was suspended in water (2 mL).
To this suspension, Ag2SO4 (0.130 g, 0.4 mmol)
was added under stirring at 44 °C, and the reaction was carried
out overnight in the dark. The suspension was filtered to remove AgI,
and the filtrate was concentrated with a rotary evaporator and subsequently
dried. The crystalline solid has the formula cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O) (SO4)].27,28 To obtain 15N-labeled CP, solid
KCl (0.322 g, 4.33 mmol) was added to the filtrate containing cis-[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O)(SO4)]. After few minutes at room temperature, cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2] precipitate was filtered, washed with cold water, and subsequently
dried. This procedure yields the cis isomer with high purity, as confirmed
by NMR (Figure 4) and
infrared (IR) spectra (Figure S9 of Supporting Information).

LC–MS Instrumentation and Operating
Conditions
All experiments were performed using an UltiMate
3000 UHPLC system
coupled to a Velos Pro linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). LC separation was performed at 30 °C on an
Accucore Polar Premium C18 column (150 2.1 mm i.d., 2.6 mm particle
size) equipped with an Accucore Polar Premium C18 (10 2.1 mm i.d.)
security guard cartridge (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples
were injected into the column via a 5.0 μL sample loop. The
following binary gradient elution program, based on water (solvent
A) and methanol (solvent B), both containing 0.1% v/v of formic acid,
was adopted: 0–2 min at 90% solvent B; 2–4 min linear
from 10 to 40% (v/v) of solvent B; 4–8 min isocratic at 40%
solvent B; 8–13 min linear from 40 to 100% (v/v) of solvent
B; 13–15 min isocratic at 100% solvent B; 15–18 min
back to the initial composition, followed by 10 min equilibration
time. The flow rate was 200 μL/min.

MS full scan acquisitions
were performed in positive ion mode, in the m/z range 150–2000. The following values were adopted
for the Velos Pro heated ESI interface (Thermo Scientific) and ion
optics parameters: sheath gas flow rate, 30 (arbitrary units); auxiliary
gas flow rate, 15 (arbitrary units); spray voltage, 4 kV (negative
polarity); capillary temperature, 275 °C; S-lens radio frequency
level, 69 (arbitrary units). MSn (n = 2–3) acquisitions were performed on targeted
precursor ions. For each fragmentation, an isolation window of 3 m/z centered on the m/z ratio of the most abundant isotopologue was used, in order
to obtain also the isotopic pattern of product ions. Collision energy
was typically 35% for both MS/MS (in this case a 400% value corresponds
to a 100 V excitation voltage) and MS3. Control of LC–MS
instrumentation and first processing of data were performed by the
Xcalibur software 2.2 SP1.48 (Thermo Scientific). MS raw data were
imported, further elaborated, and finally turned into figures by the
SigmaPlot 12.5 software (Systat Software, Inc., London, UK). The ChemDraw
Pro 8.0.3 software (CambridgeSoft Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA)
was employed to draw chemical structures. The m/z values listed in the text refer to the most intense peak
of the isotopic clusters.

Preparation of Conjugates between CNCbl and
Pt(II) Complexes
Stock solutions of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
and hydrated cis-diammineplatinum(II)20 1.0 mg/mL were prepared in LC-grade water and
sonicated for ca. 30 min. Adducts with CNCbl were synthesized as follows:
4.0 μL of stock solution of CNCbl (1 mg/mL in LC-grade water)
was mixed in different vials with 125 μL of each solution of
the platinum complexes. The resultant mixtures were kept under agitation
at 60 °C for 16 h in 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Each sample was
pretreated with micro-C18 ZipTips columns (Millipore), using a mobile
phase consisting of H2O and CH3OH 50:50 v/v
containing both 0.1% HCOOH. The product of this purification was diluted
1:2 in a 0.1% HCOOH aqueous solution and then analyzed.

Solution NMR
Experiments
15N-labeled CP
(cis-[PtCl2(15NH3)2]) was dissolved immediately prior to use in pure deoxygenated
water. The complex solution was extensively vortexed and sonicated,
and the exact Pt concentration was determined by atomic absorption
spectroscopy using a Varian 880Z instrument. 15N-labeled
CP was added to CNCbl and the reaction was monitored through 2D 1H–5N HSQC spectra, acquired in water with
10% D2O (for the field-frequency lock) at 37 °C, using
a gradient-enhanced sequence in which coherence selection and water
suppression were achieved by gradient pulses. Sixteen transients were
acquired over an F2 (1H) spectral width of 14 ppm centered
at 4.7 ppm, into 2048 data points for each of 128 t1 increments with
an F1 (15N) spectral width of 100 ppm centered at −50
ppm, using a delay 1/(4JNH) of 2.78 ms
and a recycle delay of 2.5 s. NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker
AVANCE III 700 UltraShield Plus magnet, equipped with quadruple resonance
(QCI) CryoProbe, and processed using the standard Bruker software
(TOPSPIN).
