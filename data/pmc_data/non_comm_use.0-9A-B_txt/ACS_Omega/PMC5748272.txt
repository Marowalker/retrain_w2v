Herein,
we report the modulation of ZnO for enhancement of its
ability toward plasmonic absorption of near-infrared (NIR) photons
through coupling of graphene (GR). The reported modification led GR–ZnO
to be a promising photocatalyst by the complete removal of poisonous
and nonvolatile potassium cyanide from water. The photocatalytic degradation
of cyanide was revealed by exposing it to NIR laser and comparing
with the rate of UV, visible, and sunlight using their apparent reaction
rate constants derived from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model.
The heteronanostructured GR–ZnO promoted rapid photo-oxidation
of cyanide under illumination with NIR laser rather than UV, visible,
and sunlight. It was assessed that the photothermal effect (PTE) is
the main cause for higher catalytic efficiency of GR–ZnO in
the presence of NIR radiations. Except for the NIR radiations, GR–ZnO
does not show any indication of PTE by irradiating with UV, visible,
or sunlight. On account of its significance, the PTE of GR–ZnO
in KCN solution was evaluated and compared with its individual components
viz., GR and ZnO upon exposure to a 980 nm laser system. Furthermore,
it has been revealed that the PTE of GR–ZnO was proportional
to its concentration. In addition to its effectiveness in the degradation
of cyanide, GR–ZnO retained its special structure and exhibited
an outstanding photostability after its repeated use in three successive
cycles.

1 Introduction
It
is identified that the distribution of energy in the solar spectrum
over earth’s surface is about 54.3% of near-infrared (NIR,
760–3000 nm), 38.9% of visible (vis, 400–760 nm), and
6.8% of ultraviolet (UV, <400 nm) range.1 Apart from the abundant availability of NIR light in solar energy,
majority of the present research is devoted to the design of heterogeneous
catalysts which are exceptionally active in UV and visible energy.
Therefore, fabrication of NIR-active heterogeneous photocatalysts
is one of the current critical needs for the proficient use of solar
energy. It is recognized that the semiconductor-based catalysts are
promising candidates for conversion of solar energy,2 although the absorption aptitude of semiconductor to NIR
radiations is absolutely low. Under this circumstance, it is identified
that the semiconductor catalysts are not ideal and their performance
is poor upon exposure to NIR radiations. Hence, it is a challenging
task to improve the absorption ability of semiconductors to NIR radiations
and creating them as robust NIR-operating catalysts.

Zinc oxide
(ZnO), a direct band gap II–VI semiconductor
is recognized as a current frontline photocatalyst because of its
wide band gap, high exciton binding energy, and excellent electron
mobility of 3.37 eV, 60 meV, and 200–300 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively.3,4 In addition, ZnO possesses tremendous photosensitivity and offer
an elevated driving force for oxidation and reduction processes.5 The electron mobility in ZnO is nearly 2 orders
of magnitude higher than that in TiO2.6 However, ZnO is highly responsive to UV light; therefore,
in the presence of sunlight, ZnO can absorb only about 7% of UV radiation
available, which forbids the real employment of ZnO in photocatalysis.
Therefore, extending the band gap of ZnO into the NIR region and elevating
its photocatalytic performance by making it responsive to NIR photons
is the current major interest. ZnO exhibits excellent tunable plasmonic
absorption especially in the NIR region; hence, it is a good candidate
for the construction of plasmon-enhanced photocatalysts. An additional
cause for the current limited applications of ZnO is its photocorrosive
nature. Therefore, to overcome these confines, the binding of ZnO
with a secondary functional material such as graphene (GR) is an superlative
premise as GR holds unique properties such as high specific surface
area (∼2600 m2/g) and excellent mobility of charge
carriers (200 000 cm2 V–1 s–1), desirable for an optimum photocatalyst.7,8 In GR, the electrons behave as massless Dirac fermions,9 and it facilitates the photoinduced charge separation
and inhibits the electron–hole recombination during photocatalysis.
In addition, the single-layered GR possesses zero band gap,10 and hybridizing GR with ZnO could modify its
band gap and result in charge transfer between ZnO and GR, enhancing
the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers.11−13 Moreover, the
heterojunction electric field created over the interface of GR and
ZnO because of the variation in Fermi levels cause rapid transfer
of photogenerated electrons from the surface of ZnO to GR, thus enhancing
the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Moreover, the presence of
GR with ZnO can significantly improve the absorption level of both
contaminants and photons of light over the surface of a catalyst.14 Overall as fascinating individuals, the assembly
of GR and ZnO could result in an exceptional hybrid structure with
enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.

Cyanide is known for its
toxicity and can cause irreparable adverse
effects on living organisms. The short-term exposure to cyanide leads
to rapid breathing, tremors, and other neurological effects, whereas
its long-term exposure results in rapid weight loss, thyroid effects,
and nerve damage and might cause death in severe condition. Under
this circumstance, cyanide is still employed in many industrial processes
including electroplating, metal processing, petroleum refining, steel
hardening, photographic applications, and hydrometallurgy.15 Moreover, cyanide is employed in the production
of organic chemicals such as nitrile, nylon, acrylic plastics, and
synthetic rubber.15 After its usage, cyanide
is released through industrially generated wastewater as a hazardous
material owing to its high solubility in water. Therefore, to prevent
its harmful effects and protect the environment and water resources,
cyanide containing effluents should be treated for its complete removal
before releasing. Therefore, because of its importance, herein, we
reported an alternate method for the complete removal of potassium
cyanide using a novel nanostructured photocatalyst, GR–ZnO,
generated by the immobilization of ZnO nanotrapezoids (NTs) over the
surface of GR nanosheets. The GR–ZnO was able to remove the
KCN entirely by the process of photo-oxidation after irradiating with
NIR radiations. Furthermore, the rate of photo-oxidation of KCN upon
exposure to NIR laser was compared with that of UV, visible, and sunlight.
It has been exposed that the photothermal effect (PTE) is the main
cause for rapid degradation of KCN, which occurred in the presence
of NIR laser.

2 Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of GO (Figure 1a) revealed a high intensity peak at 9.9°
corresponding to its (002) crystallographic plane, and the additional
low-intensity peak appeared at 42.7° was indexed to the (100)
plane of GR.16 It was found that the interlayer d-spacing value in GO (0.89 nm) was efficiently higher than
the value calculated for graphite (0.34 nm) (Figure 1b), which is accounted for the introduction
of oxygen-containing functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl,
and epoxy groups and grafting of water molecules to the surface of
GO. The significant difference perceived in the value of the interlayer d-spacing between graphite and GO indicates the successful
conversion of graphite to GO. After subjecting the mixture of GO and
zinc nitrate to the hydrothermal process, the resulting GR–ZnO
(Figure 1c) provided
the well-resolved peaks analogous to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110),
(103), (200), (112), (201), (004), and (202) crystallographic planes
of hexagonal ZnO at 31.8°, 34.5°, 36.2°, 47.5°,
56.6°, 62.8°, 66.4°, 67.9°, 69.1°, 72.6°,
and 76.9°, respectively (JCPDS no. 36-1451). In addition, a weakly
resolved peak at 23.7° was found, which depicted (002) reflection
of GR.17 This peak of GR in GR–ZnO
can be distinctly identifiable in Figure S1. The lower intensity of the GR peak in GR–ZnO could be ascribed
to the successful exfoliation of GR nanosheets due to anchoring of
ZnO NTs over their surface.16 Also, the
absence of a characteristic peak related to GO in GR–ZnO facilitates
the successful conversion of GO to GR. It is found that there is no
considerable shift was recorded in the position of ZnO reflections
in GR–ZnO compared to pristine ZnO (Figure 1d), which reveals the nondisruption of the
crystalline structure of ZnO after its conjugation with GR nanosheets.
Therefore, the GR did not dope in the crystal lattice of ZnO, instead
the GR nanosheets provided an ideal platform to grow ZnO NTs. Moreover,
the coupling of ZnO with GR has prevented the restacking of GR nanosheets
in GR–ZnO.

and (d) ZnO.

The Raman spectrum recorded
for GO (Figure 2a)
demonstrated two characteristic peaks
situated at 1328 and 1598 cm–1, and these peaks
are assigned as D and G band, respectively. The D band is related
to the breathing mode of k-point phonons of A1g symmetry that arise owing to local defects and disorder,
particularly at the edges of GR, whereas the G band is ascribed to
the E2g phonon mode of sp2-hybridized carbon
atoms. The spectrum of GR–ZnO (Figure 2b) has displayed both D and G bands located
at 1304 and 1588 cm–1, respectively. The blue shift
observed with D and G bands for GR–ZnO compared to GO details
the successful conversion of GO to its reduced form, GR by a hydrothermal
process. The characteristic peak in GR–ZnO was slightly shifted
compared to the spectrum of GR (Figure 2c), which is ascribed to the structure of GR in GR–ZnO
that was not ruined by its conjugation with ZnO. There are no obvious
characteristic peaks observed for ZnO (Figure 2d) in the measured region; therefore, the
minute shift in the peaks observed for GR–ZnO compared to GR
is accounted for the strong interaction that persists between GR nanosheets
and ZnO NTs. However, the intensity ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG) calculated
for GO was 1.14, which was lower than the ratio found for GR–ZnO
(1.31). This indicates the increase in the number of smaller sp2 domains in GR–ZnO.16,18 However, this
ratio for GR was found to be 1.61, which is higher than the value
calculated for GR–ZnO. This indicates that the defective sites
persisting over GR nanosheets were reduced by the deposition of ZnO
NTs over their surfaces. Furthermore, the FWHM of the D band for GO
and GR was found to be 124 and 94 cm–1, respectively,
whereas it was 130 cm–1 for GR–ZnO. This
attenuation reveals that the anchoring of ZnO NTs with GR nanosheets
improves the degree of crystallinity in GR.19

and (d) ZnO.

The FT-IR spectrum of
GO (Figure 3a) has
exhibited the characteristic absorption bands
consistent with oxygen-containing functional groups, viz., O–H
stretching of water and C=O stretching of COOH groups at 3395
and 1719 cm–1, respectively. The epoxy symmetrical
ring C–O deformation vibrations or phenolic C–O–H
stretching was observed at 1161 cm–1 and the alkoxy
C–O stretching was observed at 1039 cm–1.16,17,20 In addition, the representative
band owing to aromatic C=C vibrations mixed with −OH
of water was found at 1620 cm–1. Compared to GO,
the spectrum of GR–ZnO (Figure 3b) did not exhibit any absorption band related to oxygen-containing
functional groups; instead, it displayed a new band at 1505 cm–1 generated by the skeletal vibration of GR.20 The additional absorption band displayed at
551 cm–1 in Figure 3b is accounted for vibrations of Zn–O.

The efficient exfoliation of GO prepared by oxidation of
graphite
is accessible with its FESEM image shown in Figure 4a. The GO nanosheets possess a two-dimensional
structure having layered sheet morphology with a wrinkled surface.
In addition, the porous structure of GO nanosheets generated by the
opening of planar carbon networks wedged at the edge surface of the
crystallite due to oxidation is distinctly observable. ZnO (Figure 4b) exhibits the formation
of uniform nanocrystals, which have a tetragonal trapezoid shape with
a smooth surface. The well-faceted tetragonal end planes of ZnO NTs
designate their single crystalline nature. The GR–ZnO (Figure 4c,d) demonstrates
the deposition of homogeneous ZnO NTs and their dense packing over
GR nanosheets. Furthermore, the GR nanosheets are clearly definable,
and they have typical crumpled sheet-like morphology. The morphology
of ZnO NTs found in pristine ZnO (Figure 4b) and GR–ZnO nanocomposite (Figure 4c,d) is identical,
such that the inherent structural morphology of ZnO NTs is retained
after their coupling with GR nanosheets also. During in situ formation
of ZnO NTs, the GR nanosheets behave as a supportive template by providing
the active sites for nucleation to ZnO, which induces uniform distribution
of ZnO NTs over GR nanosheets. The sequential washings performed during
purification of GR–ZnO could not lead to the detachment of
ZnO NTs from GR nanosheets, which reveals the strong adherence of
ZnO NTs over GR nanosheets and the intimate contact existing between
them. The elemental composition of GR–ZnO was analyzed by energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) (Figure S2), and this
indicates the presence of C, Zn, and O elements; of these, Zn and
O signals are generated by ZnO NPs, and the strong C signal is originated
from GR nanosheets. The EDS of GR–ZnO depicts the presence
of only C, Zn, and O elements, which reveals the purity of GR–ZnO.

images of (a) graphene oxide, (b) ZnO, and (c,d) GR–ZnO.

The UV–vis–NIR spectrum
of GO shown in Figure 5a demonstrated the characteristic
π → π* transitions of aromatic C–C bonds
and n → π* transitions of C=O bonds in terms of
an absorption band at 229 nm and a shoulder around 300 nm, respectively.
The spectrum of ZnO (Figure 5b) possesses the typical absorption at 365 nm, which is comparable
with the value reported for ZnO.16 The
spectrum of GR–ZnO (Figure 5c) displayed a shoulder around 215 nm and a weak absorption
at 280 nm. Both of these is barely recognizable in Figure 5c, whereas distinctly visible
in Figure S3. These absorptions are corresponding
to π → π* transition of GR, and it is consistent
with the absorption found in aqueous stable GR.21 Apart from this, an obvious band was revealed at 369 nm
in Figure 5c, which
corresponds to ZnO. Therefore, the existence of both GR and ZnO in
GR–ZnO has been experimentally observed by its UV–vis–NIR
spectrum. Moreover, GO, ZnO, and GR–ZnO have exhibited strong
absorption in the NIR region, which signifies the high absorption
ability of these samples to NIR radiations.

spectra of (a) graphene oxide, (b) ZnO,
and (c) GR–ZnO.

The photocatalytic activity of GR–ZnO was assessed
by photodegradation
of potassium cyanide under illumination using a NIR laser system in
consideration of its nonvolatility and common availability of cyanide
in industrial waste water. Figure 6 shows the kinetic profile of degradation of KCN over
the surface of GR–ZnO and its comparison with discrete components
viz., GR and ZnO. Interestingly, complete or 100% degradation of KCN
occurred in 60 min of exposure in the presence of GR–ZnO, whereas
it was 46 and 59% for GR and ZnO, respectively. It reveals that the
absorption of NIR radiations over the surface of GR–ZnO has
been significantly improved because of the complex structure generated
by the strong binding of ZnO NTs to the surface of GR nanosheets.
However, the degradation rate of KCN measured without any catalyst
in the presence of NIR laser and with catalyst in the absence of NIR
laser was minute or negligible, which implies that both the catalyst
and light source are absolutely necessary for the process of photodegradation.

Figure 6 Degradation
profile of KCN over the surface of GR–ZnO, ZnO,
and graphene by irradiating with NIR laser.

In addition, the degradation of KCN was evaluated by replacing
the NIR laser with UV, visible, and sunlight under identical experimental
conditions used in NIR to reveal the effect of different light sources
(Figure 7). Prior to
their comparison, the influence of power of light by selecting visible
light-producing lamps with different power viz., 40 and 90 W was estimated.
It was observed that the degradation of KCN was not significantly
influenced by varying the power of lamps (Figure S4), which elucidates that the degradation of KCN does not
specifically depend on the power of the light source. Furthermore,
upon exposure to UV light, the complete degradation of KCN was attained
in 90 min in the presence of GR–ZnO, whereas it occurred at
140 min upon irradiation with visible light (90 W). However, the sunlight
was unable to degrade the KCN completely; instead, it was degraded
about 53% upon its exposure for 140 min. In detail, the photocatalytic
degradation of KCN was quantitatively estimated by comparing the apparent
reaction rate constants (kapp) calculated
from a simple first-order rate equation derived from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
(L–H) model.20,22 In each experiment, the initial
concentration of KCN was low; thus, under this condition, the L–H
equation becomes 1  where C0 is the
initial concentration of KCN and C is its concentration
at particular time of photocatalytic reaction. kapp is the apparent rate constant of the reaction and t is the time of irradiation. The L–H plots obtained
for the degradation of KCN were linear, which suggests that the photodegradation
of KCN follows the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (Figure 8). Accordingly, the
values of kapp calculated for illumination
of NIR, UV, visible, and sunlight were found to be 0.0722, 0.0363,
0.0242, and 0.0065 min–1, respectively. The rapid
photodegradation of KCN was observed by irradiating the NIR laser
compared to other light sources. The promoted degradation of KCN upon
illumination of NIR laser could be related to the generation of PTE.
As it has been already revealed that NIR radiations are primarily
accountable for PTE, it plays a leading role in the enhancement of
the photocatalytic process.23 Therefore,
in order to evaluate the PTE of GR–ZnO, its dispersion in KCN
solution was exposed to NIR radiations and the rise in temperature
was recorded. The GR–ZnO dispersion at its concentration levels
of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL in KCN solution were illuminated with a 980
nm NIR laser, and the elevation in temperature was monitored. Figure 9 compares the PTE
of GR–ZnO with GR and ZnO in KCN solution. By illumination
with NIR laser for 7 min, the total temperature rise for GR–ZnO
was 49.7 °C. Under similar conditions, temperature elevation
recorded for GR was 47.6 °C, and it was 44.2 °C for ZnO
NTs (Table 1). Conversely,
the PTE shown by KCN solution and water was 17.1 and 8.3 °C,
respectively. Therefore, the PTE of KCN and water were significantly
lower than the PTE of GR, ZnO, and GR–ZnO. In particular, the
PTE of GR–ZnO was found to be considerably higher than both,
GR and ZnO, and this improvement is accounted for a special structure
created in GR–ZnO by anchoring of ZnO NTs over the surface
of GR nanosheets. The presence of GR with ZnO has substantially improved
the aptitude of GR–ZnO in terms of their ability to absorb
NIR radiations and their conversion to thermal energy. Moreover, it
was found that the PTE of GR–ZnO in KCN solution was directly
proportional to its concentration (Figure S5). Specifically, the PTE of GR–ZnO was systematically enhanced
with respect to its concentration of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL. The PTE
of GR–ZnO was measured for five cycles to evaluate its photostability
(Figure 10). However,
the absence of attenuation in thermal efficiency of GR–ZnO
was noticed by its employment in five cycles, which demonstrates the
excellent photostability of GR–ZnO.

Furthermore,
in consideration of the practical application of a
catalyst, its recycling, stability, and employment in further cycles
are crucial. Therefore, the GR–ZnO was recovered after its
application in the degradation of KCN by illuminating with NIR laser
through centrifugation and used in successive four cycles. It was
observed that after its employment in five cycles, the photocatalytic
activity of GR–ZnO was not considerably reduced (Figure S6). Apart from this, to verify the photostability,
phase composition, and structure of GR–ZnO after its application
in five consecutive degradation cycles, the XRD pattern was recorded
and compared with that of unused GR–ZnO (Figure S7), and no significant modification was found among
those. This suggests that GR–ZnO possesses sufficient photostability
for its reuse, and the photodegradation process could not rupture
the structure of GR–ZnO and detach the ZnO NTs from the surface
of GR nanosheets.

Overall, the mechanism for the degradation
of cyanide in terms
of its photooxidation over the surface of GR–ZnO can be illustrated
as15 2   3   4   5   6  

The process of catalytic degradation
of cyanide is initiated by
photoexcitation of ZnO that exists over GR nanosheets, followed by
the generation of electron–hole pairs over the surface of GR–ZnO.
Then, the electrons react with oxygen and water molecules to produce
hydroxide ions (OH–), and these hydroxide ions interact
with holes to form hydroxyl radicals (OH•). Thus,
the created hydroxyl radicals oxidize the CN– into
an intermediate species, cyanate (OCN–), and it
further oxidizes to CO2 and N2. The overall
mechanism is schematically depicted in Figure 11.

of cyanide over the
surface of GR–ZnO.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, the coupling of
GR with ZnO significantly enhances
the efficiency of ZnO toward absorption of NIR radiations. Unlike
the traditional ZnO-based photocatalysts, which can assist the absorption
of exclusive UV and visible radiations, herein, ZnO extends its absorption
ability toward NIR photons. The heterostructured GR–ZnO is
an excellent NIR-induced photocatalyst and is able to remove the cyanide
completely from water by the process of photo-oxidation. For the enhancement
of the photocatalytic activity of GR–ZnO by irradiating with
NIR radiations, the PTE plays the key role. The GR–ZnO is a
robust photocatalyst with excellent photostability, and it can be
repeatedly used several times without reduction in its catalytic activity.
Owing to its potential in the removal of cyanide, GR–ZnO can
provide an alternate path to address the environmental issues. Overall,
this study opens up wide possibilities in utilizing NIR radiations
to improve the process of photocatalysis and designing of outstanding
NIR-active photocatalysts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The chemicals used in the
experiments were from Aldrich and were used as received without any
additional purification. The aqueous solutions were prepared using
ultrapure water produced by the Millipore’s Milli-Q Plus system.

4.2 Synthesis of GO and GR–ZnO
Graphene
oxide (GO) was synthesized by graphite powder by the Hummers
and Offeman method.20,24 The GO was implemented in the
synthesis of GR–ZnO using the method reported priorly.25 To mention briefly, GO (10 mg) was dispersed
in ethanol (15 mL) by sonication, followed by the addition of aqueous
solution of zinc acetate (10 mL, 1 mmol). The resulting suspension
was allowed to stir for 15 min, and an aqueous solution of NaOH (8
mmol) was added. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave after stirring for 15 min. The autoclave
was permitted to heat at 140 °C for 8 h, and the product, GR–ZnO,
was purified by successive processes of centrifugation and washing
with ethanol and DI water.

4.3 Photo-Oxidation of KCN
The photo-oxidation
of KCN in the presence of GR–ZnO was assessed by illuminating
the NIR (980 nm, 2 W/cm2), UV (450 W), visible (40 and
90 W), and sunlight. The process of photo-oxidation was studied in
the natural atmosphere, without any external source of aeration. For
all experiments, GR–ZnO (10 mg) was added to 100 mL aqueous
solution of KCN (10 mg L–1) ,and the suspension
was stirred in the dark for 30 min to complete adsorption/desorption
of KCN over the surface of GR–ZnO. Prior to the photocatalytic
process, pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted in between 8 and
10 to prevent the evolution of toxic hydrogen cyanide gas. The reaction
mixture was transferred to a double-walled quartz photocatalytic reactor
having the facility of water circulation in order to maintain the
catalytic mixture at room temperature. Subsequently, the reaction
mixture was exposed to different light sources with constant magnetic
stirring and at a given interval of time, and 5 mL of KCN suspension
was taken out. Because KCN could not absorb in the visible region,
its concentration was estimated with picric acid Fisher and Brown’s
method.26,27 In detail, 5 mL of KCN suspension after
photocatalysis was added to 5 mL aqueous solutions of 0.5% (w/v) picric
acid and 0.25 M Na2CO3. The resulting solution
was placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, diluted to 15% with
distilled water, and cooled. Then, the absorbance of the solution
was evaluated using a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer at
520 nm using picric acid solution as reference. Using the absorbance
value, the photodegradation rate of KCN was determined.

4.4 Photothermal Effect
The PTE of samples
was assessed by irradiating their suspension in KCN solution with
980 nm laser having an output power of 2 W/cm2 (ArmaLaser
Inc., United States). In each, a cuvette containing 1 mL of sample,
dispersed in KCN solution was irradiated by laser. The resulting variation
in the temperature of suspension was recorded by a digital thermometer
(Hanna, model: HI93510).

4.5 Characterization
Scintag X-ray diffractometer
(PAD X), equipped with a Cu Kα photon source (45 kV, 40 mA)
at a scanning rate of 3°/min was used to record XRD. Smiths ChemID
diamond attenuated total reflection (DATR) spectrometer was utilized
to record the ATR–IR spectra of samples. A JEOL JXA-8900 microscope
was employed to obtain the SEM images and EDS, and Renishaw R-3000QE
was used to acquire Raman spectra. The Jasco V-770 spectrophotometer
was used for UV–vis–NIR spectra of samples.
