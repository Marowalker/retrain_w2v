Developing
a novel electrode material with better electrochemical behavior and
extended cyclability is a major issue in the field of hybrid capacitors.
In this work, we propose a novel strategy for the facile synthesis
of nickel–cobalt pyrophosphate nanoparticles anchored on graphitic
carbon nitride (NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4) via the simple solvothermal method. Field emission scanning
electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis
revealed the uniform anchoring of NiCoP2O7 nanocomposite
on g-C3N4 nanosheets. Benefitting from the effect
of amorphous nature and a conductive matrix of the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 (NP3) composite, the material
achieves a specific capacitance of 342 F g–1 at
a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. Impressively, the electrode
shows long-term cycling stability with 100% capacitance retention
over 5000 cycles. Employing activated carbon as an anode and as-prepared
NP3 as a cathode, the assembled asymmetric hybrid cell exhibits high-energy
density and exceptional cyclability (specific capacitance retention
over 10 000 cycles). The outstanding electrochemical and cyclic
stability is attributed to the shortest electron-ion pathway with
effective interfacial interaction. The low electronic resistance of
the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 nanocomposite
is revealed by varying the bias voltage variation in the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy. Our results promise better utilization of
the bimetallic pyrophosphate-anchored g-C3N4 matrix as a potential electrode for high-performance energy storage
devices.

1 Introduction
Over
the recent past, electrochemists across the world concern more about
the affordable efficient energy storage systems in order to meet their
demand from simpler commercial electronics to high power electric
vehicles. In this aspect, hybrid capacitors have been spotlighted
because of their functional capability to merge the double-layer capacitor
and pseudocapacitor with remarkably improved energy and power density.1−3 In general, a hybrid capacitor comprises two distinguishable electrodes
which have redox- and electrostatic-type charge storage mechanisms.
In comparison with electrostatic-type electrodes, redox-type electrodes
possess reversible, rapid faradic redox reaction by which it offers
very high-energy densities. Furthermore, redox-type electrodes were
again classified into surface redox pseudocapacitance and intercalation
pseudocapacitance electrodes. The basic difference among the intercalation
pseudocapacitance and surface redox pseudocapacitance electrodes is
a redox reaction at precise potential and continuous surface redox
reaction over an extended potential range, respectively.4−7

Among various types of electrodes, the intercalation pseudocapacitance
electrode exhibits better electrochemical performance with improved
specific capacitance and enriched energy density. Nevertheless, in
practical applications, they suffer from cycling and structural stability
which constrain their extended application in various fields. To improve
the electrochemical performance of the intercalation pseudocapacitance
electrode, serious efforts have been undertaken on electrode materials
such as metal carbonates, metal hydroxide, metal phosphates, and so
on.8 Recently, transition-metal pyrophosphates,
a less explored polyanionic-type material, have been widely studied
as a novel electrode material for the upcoming next-generation hybrid
capacitors because of their robust three-dimensional (P2O7)4− matrix with several sites for
metal ions. The high binding energy of oxygen with polyanionic group
renders excellent chemical stability and multidimensional pathway
for ionic conduction in these materials.9

Huang pang et al. synthesized hierarchal cobalt pyrophosphate
and explored its electrochemical performance exhibiting a maximum
specific capacitance of 367 F g–1 at a current density
of 0.625 A/g.10 Similarly, amorphous nickel
pyrophosphate was prepared which is found to have a high specific
capacitance of 1050 F g–1.11 Chen et al. prepared amorphous nickel cobalt microplates and explored
their application as a cathode for a supercapacitor, which gave a
highest specific capacitance of 1259 F g–1 at a
current density of 1.5 A/g. The stronger faradic redox reaction was
rendered by nickel and cobalt ions in ternary nickel cobalt pyrophosphate
(NiCoP2O7) which exhibits enhanced electrochemical
performance compared to that of monometallic pyrophosphate such as
cobalt pyrophosphate.12 Further, the non-noble
metal composite, NiCoP2O7, has better electrical
conductivity and improved reversibility with higher theoretical capacity
than that of the metal oxides and metal sulfide as a result of the
lower electronegativity nature of phosphates.13,14 However, NiCoP2O7 still suffers from high
capacity fade because of the degradation of NiCoP2O7 into nickel and cobalt ions during charging and discharging,
by which approximately 20% loss is observed after 2000 cycles12 along with worse cycling stability. In addition,
the self-agglomeration of NiCoP2O7 rationally
degrades the electrochemical performance of the corresponding devices,
when attempted for commercialization. An effective strategy to address
the above issue is to design and fabricate NiCoP2O7 functional electrode within the conductive network, rendering
abundant active sites with reduced self-agglomeration and tailored
electron pathway, leading to improved faradic performances.

Out of various carbon-based materials, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted a great attention as a versatile
matrix. Because of the presence of pyrrolic N “hole”
surface defect at lattice and short distance ordering of covalently
bonded nitrogen at the edge, the material possesses a high rate capability.15−18 The porosity nature of heptazine and sp2 hybridized nitrogen
provides NiCoP2O7 coordination site, and the
metal ions bind with three adjacent N atoms. By preparing such interesting
architecture of a bimetallic transition-metal pyrophosphate impregnated
on the g-C3N4 mesh with improved redox sites,
it is possible to improve the electrical conductivity, wettability
in the electrolyte, and the surface polarity which could result in
excellent cyclability with high rate capability in a hybrid capacitor.19−25

Herein, for the first time, we report a simple strategy to
develop a novel amorphous bimetallic NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 composite supported on a nickel plate.
In this nanocomposite, NiCoP2O7 nanoparticles
are homogeneously dispersed and trapped within the g-C3N4 matrix, which can enhance the passage of electrons
in the framework. The inhibition of self-agglomeration and inert nature
of g-C3N4 improves the stability of the active
material. The favorable ion kinetics of the g-C3N4 network benefits easy access of electrolyte ions to the active material
by shortening the diffusion pathway and thus promotes the electron
transport. The NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 composites, as a cathode, give excellent specific capacity
retention capability of 100% after 5000 cycling at a current density
of 15 mA/g. In order to investigate the device performance, we have
fabricated hybrid supercapacitor with synergistically modified NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 and activated carbon
(AC) as a cathode and anode, respectively. The fabricated hybrid supercapacitor
exhibits exceptional energy densities (65.8 W h kg–1) among ternary metal composite-based supercapacitors with a high
rate of electron transfer and outstanding cycling retention.

2 Formation Mechanism of the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 Hybrid
A facile solvothermal technique
was adopted to prepare NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 composite as a high-energy supercapacitor electrode
and is schematically demonstrated in Scheme 1. Initially, g-C3N4 was dissolved in ethanol to form a stable solution followed by the
addition of nickel and cobalt precursors along with ammonium dihydrogen
phosphate (ADP) and was mixed homogeneously at room temperature. Ni2+ and Co2+ combine with ADP to form a complex ion
of CoNiNH4PO4·H2O, and the as-formed
complex ions are readily adsorbed on the surface of the carbon mesh
because of the negatively charged surface of g-C3N4. Then, the reaction system is maintained at 140 °C for
12 h. Under this temperature, ADP was thermally decomposed to form
NiCoP2O7 with the evolution of ammonia gas.
The anchored seeds of NiCoP2O7 on the carbon
foam proceed for the formation of a NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 hybrid composite with controlled crystallization
and agglomeration rendered by the solvothermal condition. The reason
behind adopting a facile solvothermal method is that usually solvent
influences the nucleation process because ethanol possesses slightly
higher saturated vapor pressure and viscosity than water and it has
slower diffusion rate of ions in the saturated state, by which it
promotes individual growth of nanoparticles, lowering growth of large
crystals.31 The resultant structure of
the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 hybrid
possesses numerous intermediate mechanisms such as Ostwald ripening,
coalescence, thermal decomposition, and self-assembling. From the
literature survey, the possible mechanism for the evolution of hybrid
composite is suggested in Scheme 1.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of Pristine g-C3N4 Nanosheets
Figure S1a discloses the powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) pattern of pure g-C3N4 which
can be well indexed with standard JCPDS card no: 87-1526. The two
sharp diffraction peaks at 13.1° and 27.7° are attributed
to in-plane structural packing (i.e., consecutive hole to hole distance
of the tris-s triazine chain) and long-range interplanar
stacking of the aromatic system, respectively. To investigate the
chemical structure of g-C3N4, Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) analysis was carried out and the resultant spectra
are presented in Figure S1b. The observed
three characteristic absorption bands at 3167, 1645–1236, and
810 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching mode of
N–H bond, stretching vibration of C–N heterocycle, and
breathing of s-triazine molecule, respectively.26−28 UV-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was performed to determine the
band gap energy level of the two-dimensional g-C3N4. From the optical absorption profile (Figure S1c), it is inferred that the absorption band centered
at 465 nm corresponds to the π–π*/n−π*
transitions. The energy difference between valence and conduction
bands that are evaluated from the intercept of tangents drawn from
(αhν2) versus photon energy
(hν) is 2.75 eV. The field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis was carried out in order to study
the morphological features of the as-prepared g-C3N4. As shown in Figure S1d, the pristine
g-C3N4 discloses the structure of wrinkled lamellar
nanomesh with a high porosity, which is the featured structural property
of g-C3N4 developed via the direct calcination
method.29,30 The as-prepared g-C3N4 was used to prepare NiP2O7/g-C3N4 and NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 composites, and the as-prepared composites were subjected
to various characterization processes.

3.2 Structural
and Morphological Analysis of the Hybrid Composites
The crystallinity
and phase purity of the as-synthesized NiP2O7 (NP1), NiP2O7/g-CN (NP2), and NiCoP2O7/g-CN (NP3) nanocomposites were investigated by PXRD
and are shown in Figure 1a. The characteristic XRD pattern of NP1 displays narrow peaks at d = 5.88, 4.36, 3.72, 3.47, 3.00, and 2.53 Å, which
are assigned to the (11̅1), (002), (3̅11), (121), (212),
and (230) diffraction planes of the nanostructure corresponding to
the monoclinic nickel pyrophosphate (JCPDS card no-74-1604) with the
calculated crystalline size of ∼13.7 nm using Debye Scherer
equation, respectively. Notably, the absence of additional peaks indicates
the phase purity of the product.

composites; (b) XPS survey spectrum of the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 nanocomposite.

The NiP2O7/g-C3N4 and NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 nanocomposites exhibited an amorphous-like XRD pattern, as
presented in Figure 1a. It is noteworthy that the amorphous nature of NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 comprises several beneficiary
properties because of their defect-rich disordered crystallinity and
physical isotropy. This isotropic amorphous nature was an appealing
feature of the NP3 composite to display enhanced electrochemical performance.
It is because it would permit fast and deep diffusivity of OH– ions into the electrode thus enabling improved electrochemical
performance than similar crystalline samples. Also, the poor crystallinity
of NP3 endows best cycling stability as stress and strain due to intercalation
and deintercalation of OH– ions are constant during
charging and discharging.31

The X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to explore the detailed
chemical structure of the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 composites, which comprises several elements, namely,
Ni 2p, Co 2p, P 2p, O 1s, C 1s, and N 1s, that are shown in Figure 1b. The high-resolution
peak fitting of Ni 2p in Figure S2b illustrates
two deconvoluted peaks at binding energies of 875.4 and 857.5 eV for
Ni 2p1/2 for Ni 2p3/2, respectively. In addition,
the satellite peaks at 880.5 and 862.1 eV are attributed to Ni2+. As displayed in Figure S2c,
the Co 2p spectrum endows two doublets from splitted spin orbits of
Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 at 799.7 and 782.8 eV,
respectively, along with the satellite peak at 802.6 eV that corresponds
to Co2+. The difference in the binding energies of Co species
is 16.3, which confirms the 2+ oxidation state of Co in the NP3 nanocomposite.32 The obtained mixed valence states at the NP3
nanocomposite efficiently enhance electronic conductivity by the possible
hopping and defect effect processes. The peak at 131.8 eV is attributed
to P 2p, which represents +5 oxidation states of P in the material.
The wider O 1s spectrum (Figure S2e) was
deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to two species, viz., chemisorbed
hydroxyl (OH) at 532.4 eV and lattice oxygen at 531.8 eV. The N 1s
high-resolution spectrum consists of three deconvoluted peaks, as
shown in Figure S2g. The peaks at 399.4,
400.9, and 402.1 eV are attributed to pyridinic N (N-6), pyrrolic
N (N-5), and quaternary N (N–Q) species, respectively.33 It is well known that the presence of pyrrolic
N and pyridinic N would build several additional defects, thus render
further active sites and diffusion channels. The high-resolution C
1s spectrum was deconvoluted into three peaks at 285.3, 287.1, and
288.5 eV. The peak centered at 285.3 eV corresponds to the graphitic
carbon, and the two peaks at 287.1 and 288.5 eV ascribed to the C–N
bond inside the aromatic structure and sp3 carbon atoms,
respectively. From the XPS results, it is suggested that NP3 possesses
the coupling of bimetallic cations (Ni2+ and Co2+), rendering rich redox sites and higher conductivity than monometallic
materials which could result in enhanced faradic processes. On the
other hand, the presence of N-containing species (N-6 and N–Q)
in NP3 efficiently improves the electrical conductivity of carbonaceous
materials.

The morphology and microstructure of the prepared
nanocomposite NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 were characterized by FESEM and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis. Figure 2a–c presents the sheet-like morphology with a uniform size
distribution of ∼10 nm smaller-sized NiCoP2O7 nanoparticles over the g-C3N4 mesh,
without any significant agglomeration. The hybrid structure could
be able to accommodate large volume changes through which it can actively
deteriorate the degradation rate of the active material during the
cycling process. This, in turn, results in the improved durability
of the supercapacitor. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between
NiCoP2O7 and g-C3N4, NP3
provides a delicate architecture with continuous ion and electron
diffusive pathways at the interface. A closer inspection with high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) analysis confirms the uniform anchoring of NiCoP2O7 nanoparticles on the g-C3N4 matrix,
as presented in Figure 2d–f. The elemental analysis was carried out using energy-dispersive
system and elemental mapping techniques, and the results are presented
in Figure S3b–g. The experimental
results indicate the presence of nickel, cobalt, phosphate, oxygen,
carbon, and nitrogen elements and their even distribution across the
sample. The structural and morphological analyses confirm the formation
of NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 composite
structure with a uniform distribution of NiCoP2O7 nanocomposites over the g-C3N4 sheets.

TEM images (b–f) for the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 hybrid composite.

3.3 Electrochemical Study
To examine
the suitability of structurally confined amorphous NiCoP2O7 anchored on two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride
as an optimal electrode of a high-performance supercapacitor, it has
been thoroughly evaluated by cyclic voltammogram (CV), galvanostatic
charge discharge (GCD), and cycling and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Figure 3a shows the CV curve of the as-synthesized
NP1, NP2, and NP3 hybrid materials at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. It is observed from the CV curve that the peak current of the prepared
samples (NP1, NP2, and NP3) exhibits its dependency on the square
root of the scan rate, indicating its better reversibility that the
reaction process is rapid enough to maintain the stable concentrations
of anions and cations at the electrode surface. The obtained CV curves
possess two different regions, namely, potential-dependant area (intercalation
pseudocapacitance type mechanism) and potential independent current
area (surface redox pseudocapacitance mechanism).

Figure 3 (a) CV curves of NP1,
NP2, and NP3 electrodes obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1; (b) CV plot of NP3 electrodes obtained at different scan rates;
(c) galvanostatic charge–discharge curve of NP1, NP2, and NP3
electrodes obtained at a current density of 5 mA g–1; and (d) NP3 composite at various current densities.

The current region below the intercalation-type
mechanism was predominant than that of the surface redox mechanism.
Hence, the contribution of intercalation-type mechanism in the charge
storage process is prevalent. The anodic peak emerges because of oxidation
of Ni and Co ions accompanied by surface adsorption of an equal number
of OH– ions. The cathodic peaks are due to the reduction
of Ni and Co ions accompanied by surface desorption of OH– ions. The possible mechanism of the faradic process in the CV study
is ascribed to the redox reaction of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+ which can be presented as follows  

The CV pattern of NP1 and
NP2 composites as a working electrode in a 2 M aqueous KOH electrolyte
at different scan rates ranging from 5 to 200 mV s–1 is presented in Figure S4a,b. It is worth
noting that the shape of the obtained CV curve is nonrectangular,
demonstrating the quasi-reversible reaction while cycling at the electrode–electrolyte
interface, and the small redox peaks at 0.41/0.27 and 0.42/0.26 V
were observed even at high scan rates. Because of the synergistic
effect of better electrochemical utilization and high charge storage
capability rendered by NiCoP2O7 and g-C3N4, the CV current area of the NP3 composite is
higher than that of the NP1 and NP2 samples [Figure 3b] and the spread over and broadened redox
peaks of NP3 at low scan rate show a sharp increment of anodic current
at higher scan rates. As a result, NP3 reveals the possibility of
interaction between oxygen evolution and the surface adsorption and
desorption of ions at high scan rates. During the CV process of NP3
electrode at higher scan rates, the reduction peaks were not observed
clearly which may be due to the surface modification of active material
by g-C3N4 and it could promote the significant
broadening of fewer faradic peaks. Subsequently, it is also observed
that peak current values show linear variation with increasing scan
rates in the range of 5–200 mV s−1 which
in turn indicates that rapid ionic and electronic mobilities are possible
at the applied potentials. The calculated specific capacitance values
indicate that NP3 shows a high specific capacitance at a low scan
rate and vice versa, which means that with the decrement of scan rate,
the capacitance value increases notably because of the effective interaction
between ions with the active surface and its bulk counterparts.34 Hence, the observed CV study suggests that compared
to the bare NiP2O7, addition of Co and g-C3N4 content enhances the electrochemical performance
by increasing a redox site and charge transport path for intercalation,
respectively. The CV analysis reveals the fact that the rational design
of carbonaceous material with composites could tailor the electrochemical
performance of the supercapacitor.

Galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements were carried out in order to evaluate the electrochemical
behavior of the as-prepared samples, within the potential window of
0 to +0.45 V, and the results are presented in Figure 3c. On comparing with NP1 and NP2, NP3 contains
large plateau region and it is inferred that NP3 possesses significantly
improved redox performance than that of other active electrode materials
and it happened because of the intercalation–deintercalation
of OH–. Consequently, for NP3 samples, the obtained
potential plateau was sloping and longer than that of NP1 and NP2
denoting its lower overpotential. Then, the specific capacitances
of NP1, NP2, and NP3 were calculated, and this capacitance of the
working electrodes decreases with a rise in applied current density
because of diminishing mobility of ions in the electrolyte and sluggish
charge migration in the course of the redox mechanism.35Figure 3d shows the variation of charge–discharge characteristics
of the NP3 sample at various current densities. It shows that the
NP3 nanocomposite can deliver a high specific capacitance of 235.5
F g–1 at a current density of 1 mA g–1 and a capacitance of 145 F g–1 is retained at
a high current density of 6 mA g–1. The variation
of specific capacitance values of the same material from CV to GCD
analysis is due to the possibility of utilizing the entire surface
in the case of CV, whereas in the charge–discharge profile,
the higher current density hinders the surface accession of OH– ions and includes inferior faradic reaction resulting
in reduced specific capacitance. The improved performance of the NP3
electrode is ascribed to the following reasons: amorphous multivalent
NiCoP2O7 composites anchored on g-C3N4 not only give back superior catalytic performance and
efficient electron conductive channels but also effectively increase
the penetration of ions along the direction of the matrix. As a suitable
conductive matrix, g-C3N4 provides increased
electrode–electrolyte interface for electrical double-layer
capacitor (EDLC)-type charge storage and also the pyrrolic N, a better
electron donor, promotes large electron transport reaction through
unimpeding channels.36 As discussed earlier,
the presence of nitrogen in the carbon matrix (N-6 and N–Q)
gives extra capacitance with high wettability and ion diffusion thus
promoting the rate capability, as verified by the following EIS measurements.

Capacitance durability is a decisive parameter for an active electrode
to be efficiently used in practical applications. Therefore, galvanostatic
charge–discharge measurements for 5000 cycles were further
carried out at a current density of 5 mA g–1 within
a potential range of 0–0.45 V, as shown in Figures 4b and S5a,b. In cycling analysis (Figure 4a), NP1 and NP2 show clear enhancement in
the capacitance value throughout the cycling process because the activation
process and active materials may not be fully exposed to electrolytes
initially. However, the specific capacitance value of the NP3 composite
maintained nearly constant value with a capacity retention of 100%,
resembling effective interface between the gC3N4 and NiCoP2O7 with the formation of the stable
state of mixed bi-metals and metal pyrophosphate. The cycling performance
is better with recent reports, and some of them are tabulated in Table S1.37,38 For closer analysis,
TEM image of NP3 after 5000 successive cycles given in Figure S7 expresses the structural variation.
Although swelling due to intercalation and deintercalation of ions
was carried out over the entire cycles, significant variation in the
morphology was not observed. However, little change in structure may
be correlated with the activation process of the NP3 composite. The
improved stability with an elongated discharge time of electrode material
after 5000 cycles is due to the combined advantage of the isotropic
amorphous phase of Ni–Co pyrophosphate and the effective interfacial
area between the electrolytes. In addition, the active material never
stimulates structural change or any phase variation.

of NP3 electrode at a current density of 15 mA g–1 over 5000 cycles (b) GCD before and after cycling of the NP3 electrode
(c,d) comparative Nyquist plot of NP1, NP2, and NP3.

Despite being a highly durable material, it should
possess greater electronic kinetics. Therefore, to further study the
transfer kinetics of NP1, NP2, and an NP3 active electrode in the
frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz, a Nyquist curve is obtained
from EIS spectra and is shown in Figure 4c,d. The Nyquist plot of nanocomposite comprises
three different frequency portions: first, high-frequency element
(semicircle) and a low-frequency element (straight sloping line vs
imaginary line) which includes a transition area between the above
said two elements known as a knee frequency. Notably, the knee frequency
where the slope is observed would be misguidedly added to Warburg
diffusion. The semicircle and linear slope line are attributed to
the electron transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte
interface and charge transfer within the electrode, respectively.39−41

On analyzing the Nyquist plot of NP1, NP2, and NP3 samples
before and after long-term cycles (Figure 4c,d), the charge-transfer resistance decreases
in the order of NP1 > NP2 > NP3. In the case of NP3, after 5000
charge–discharge cycles, the solution resistance (Rs) increases from 0.463 to 0.477 Ω along with the
charge-transfer resistance (Rct) from
6.52 to 13.54 Ω. The Nyquist plots revealed superior electrochemical
kinetics of NP3, in the sense. For NP1 and NP2, it is exhibiting increment
in the electrode–electrolyte interface access resistance and
charge-transfer resistance after cycling. At the same time, NP3 is
showing negligible changes in the high- and mid-frequency regions.
The lowering of Rct value suggests that
a synergistic effect of amorphous bimetallic ions anchored on the
carbon matrix possesses short electron diffusive pathway than the
other two materials (NP1 and NP2) favoring a long-term stability of
the cathode. This facilitates NP3 material to operate as an ideal
electrode under such low frequencies.

3.4 Hybrid
Capacitor
From the CV, GCD, and EIS analysis, NP3 was chosen
to be a suitable cathode for constructing a hybrid supercapacitor
with AC as an anode and 2 M KOH as the electrolyte. This hybrid supercapacitor
delivers high-energy density with excellent cyclability. Figure 5a shows CV curve
of the anode measured in the range of −1.0 to 0 V exhibiting
a typical EDLC behavior, whereas the CV pattern of cathode measured
in the range of 0–0.5 V shows excellent redox performance.
The optimum operating potential of the hybrid supercapacitor was chosen
as 0–1.4 V. As shown in Figure 5b, the CV analysis of the as-prepared full cell was
carried out in the potential range of 0–1.5 V. The CV curve
shows the mixed energy storage mechanism (capacitive and battery type)
for all the scan rates increasing in the order of 5, 7, 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, and 100 mV s–1. The curves expand but no
obvious change was obtained in the shape of the CV curve. The experimental
observation reveals the rapid kinetic behavior and high Columbic efficiency
of the hybrid supercapacitor.

Figure 5 (a) CV curves of AC and NP3 electrodes obtained
at the same scan rate; (b) CV plot of the device obtained at various
scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s–1; (c) galvanostatic
charge–discharge curve of hybrid device at a current density
of 1–10 mA g–1; and (d) cycling performance
at a current density of 15 mA g–1 over 10 000
cycles.

Figure 5c illustrates the charge–discharge
plot at a set of current densities ranging from 1 to 10 mA g–1. The GCD at different current densities with symmetrical shapes
suggests faradic capacitive behavior, and the absence of potential
drop indicates negligible loss of energy in the fabricated device.
As shown in Figure S6, specific capacitance
was calculated as 67.14 F g–1 at a current density
of 1 mA g–1; even at high current density, the device
maintains reasonable capacitance indicating excellent rate capability.
Such enhanced performance of the device is assigned to electric double-layer
capacitance of AC and outstanding properties of the NP3 composite.

For practical applications of hybrid supercapacitor, energy density
alone is not enough but also it has to maintain specific capacitance
for a long time. In Figure 5d, it has been proved by running 10 000 times charge
and discharge cycles. Up to 6000 cycles, the specific capacitance
of the hybrid supercapacitor increased and decreased because of the
activation process of the hybrid composite electrode. It is because
the amorphous NiCoP2O7 is attached with g-C3N4 sheets (see Figure 2) so it has to be activated for a long time
to achieve the charge flow through the pores with the help of g-C3N4. After 6000 cycles, the device has retained
100% of its performance for the rest of 4000 cycles without any further
degradation. The hybrid supercapacitor possesses long-termed cyclic
retention, which is proven by the stability analysis. The hybrid supercapacitor
was further examined by both CV and GCD test after 10 000 cycles
and is shown in Figure 6a,b; both CV and GCD curve analyses revealed no considerable changes
in the electrochemical performance.

GCD curves and (c,d) Nyquist plot at various bias voltages of device.

EIS is a powerful technique to
investigate the electrochemical process in depth, where variations
in bias voltage and frequency strongly influence the electrochemical
performance and their outputs reveal the electrochemical nature of
the electrode material. Nowadays, researchers try to understand the
intercalation mechanism using EIS, and there are very few reports
for investigating the hybrid capacitor with EIS.42,43 Here, we have analyzed the NP3 composite-based hybrid capacitor
by changing the bias voltage. EIS measurements at different bias potentials
ranging from 0.1 to 1.4 V were carried out for the device before and
after the stability test and are shown in Figure 6c,d. The Nyquist plot can be divided into,
viz., three major parts high, mid, and low frequencies which indicate
the electrode–electrolyte interface, charge-transfer resistance,
and adsorptive nature of ions with the surface of electrode, respectively.
The straight line at low-frequency range displays a linear variation,
and at the lower potential nearby, vertical line along the imaginary
axis is obtained. In particular, when the dc bias voltage ranges from
0.1 to 0.6 V, the impedance plot initially exhibits nearly vertical
line together with the imaginary plane and later tends to exhibit
a significant variation (i.e., a deviation from 90°) along the
imaginary axis denoting more facile OH– ionic intercalation
in the metallic pyrophosphates. Later, on increasing the bias potential
from 0.7 to 1.4 V, the charge-transfer resistance before cycling and
after cycling shows slight increment in the Rct value by 6.4 Ω and the line at low frequency shows
a tendency of getting closer to 90° along an imaginary axis representing
the ideal capacitive behavior. Also, the length of the slope line
decreases indicating higher diffusion resistance of OH– ions at higher bias voltages. In addition, when the bias voltage
is increased from 0.1 to 1.4 V initially, the deviation from the nearly
right angle takes place linearly and gets back when it approaches
1.4 V. This deviation is assigned to reversible intercalation of the
OH– type mechanism.44 Second, the diameter variation of the Warburg-type element corresponding
to the diffusion of OH– ions in the mid to low and
high-frequency region is significant. On increasing the bias potential,
the diameter of the curve decreases with the appearance of a diffusion
resistance region (also called Warburg impedance) corresponding to
the diffusion of OH– ions through the electrode.
On further increase from 0.1 V, the Warburg region tends to decrease
and at 1.4 V, the presence of merely absent Warburg region may be
attributed to the low resistance offered by the surface layer and
short diffusion path for the mobility of OH– ions.
Although the biased voltage varies, the intercept at x-axis z′(real part) of higher frequency range
coincides with each other, suggesting that (i) untainted charge-transfer
resistance, (ii) contact as well as diffusive resistance at the interface
between working electrode–current collector, and (iii) electronic
and ionic charge-transfer resistance. This variation of impedance
spectroscopy with the bias voltage shows that the diffusion-type battery
mechanism involved in the process. The optimum bias voltage in which
the working electrode can exhibit better capacitance is 0.1–0.5
V and is in good agreement with the obtained CV analysis. At these
potentials, z″ imaginary part of impedance
shows a steep increment representing a vertical line characteristic
of the ideally polarizable active electrode. This nature recommends
specifically pseudocapacitance contribution in the overall energy
storage. The variation in both terms (such as mechanism and resistance)
can be assigned to the pore activation process of the electrode.

Finally, the Ragone plot (Figure 7) was used to investigate the electrochemical performance
of the hybrid capacitor. The Ragone plot of ASC remarkably reached
the energy density of ∼65.8 W h kg–1 at a
power density of 0.2 W kg–1, displaying an improved
energy capability. In addition, it exhibits relatively higher energy
density than recent reports and few of those are tabulated in Table S1.45−48 The overall experimental results indicate a fact
that the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and a hybrid capacitor
constructed with NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 displays efficient charge storage capability with long-term
cycle stability.

capacitor.

4 Conclusions
Concisely, in the present work, the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 hybrid nanocomposite has been successfully
developed by a facile solvothermal technique. The as-synthesized NP3
hybrid nanocomposite showed an improved specific capacitance of 341.58
F g–1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1, which was higher compared with NP1 and NP2 composites. The g-C3N4 matrix forbids the degradation of NiCoP2O7 and disintegration of active material during
long-term cycling, resulting in excellent cycling retention of 100%
after 5000 cycles at a current density of 15 mA s–1. The novel and durable hybrid capacitor assembled using NP3 and
AC as a cathode and anode, respectively, delivered a high-energy density
of 65.8 W h kg–1 at a power density of 0.233 W kg–1 with enhanced cyclability over 10 000 cycles.
Hence, this study sheds light on the development and optimization
of various multimetallic pyrophosphate architectures on carbon nitride.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Synthesis of NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 Nanocomposite
Analytical grade C3H6N6, Ni (NO3)2·6H2O, Co (NO3)2·6H2O, and C2·H6O were used as received without any further purification. In a typical
procedure, bulk g-C3N4 was synthesized by calcination
of melamine at a semi-closed crucible to skip out overreaction with
oxygen at 500 °C for 4 h and 520 °C for 2 h. As-prepared
bulk g-C3N4 was subjected to liquid exfoliation
to obtain 2D g-C3N4 nanosheet morphology. In
a typical reaction, 0.1 g of as-prepared bulk carbon nitride was dispersed
in double distilled water and ultrasonicated for 30 min. After that,
pale yellow color graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets were collected. To prepare NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, 70 mg of g-C3N4 was thoroughly dispersed in 70 mL of ethanol and then
an appropriate amount of nickel nitrate, cobalt nitrate, and (ADP)
were added. The g-C3N4 content in the NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 composite was in
the ratio of 0.5:1. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature,
to attain a homogeneous solution and then transferred into a Teflon-lined
stainless autoclave maintained at 140 °C for 12 h. After cooling
down to room temperature naturally, the products were collected and
centrifuged and dried at 60 °C for 10 h. Then, the sample was
annealed at 400 °C for 2 h at a rate of 1 °C min–1 in a flowing atmosphere. Pristine NiP2O7 and
NiP2O7/g-C3N4 nanocomposite
were also prepared by similar procedure without the addition of Co/g-C3N4 and Co precursors, respectively.

5.2 Characterization Techniques
Crystallographic information
of the samples was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku
mini flux II) equipped with high intense Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418 Å). The elemental composition and valence state of NiCoP2O7/g-C3N4 hybrid were recorded
by using XPS (Thermo Scientific MultiLab 2000). Using (FESEM JEOL
7600F), the morphological features and its microstructures were investigated.
HRTEM with mapping images and high resolution was recorded from JEOL,
2100F instrument, HORIBA EMAXX-ACT that was connected with TEM. The
CHI627 workstation with conventional three electrodes electrochemical
cell setup was used for analyzing the electrochemical properties of
the prepared samples and fabricated device. Finally,
the EIS was performed by using a ZAHNER impedance analyzer.
