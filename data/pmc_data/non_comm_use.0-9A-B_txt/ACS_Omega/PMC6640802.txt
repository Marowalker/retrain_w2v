The
discovery of naturally occurring ArH+ in various
regions of the interstellar medium has shown the need for more understanding
of the reactions that lead to covalently bonded noble gas molecules.
The test comes with trying to predict the formation of other small
noble gas molecules. Many molecules have been observed in various
interstellar environments, which possess the possibility of bonding
with noble gases. This work explores how both argon and neon can form
bonds to ligands made of these species through quantum chemical computations.
Argon and neon are chosen as they are among the most abundant atoms
in the universe but are more polarizable than the more common but
smaller helium atom. Reactions leading to noble gas molecules are
modeled in the gas phase as well as through the adsorbed phase by
catalysis with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) surface. The
adsorption energy of the neutral noble gas atoms to the surface increases
as the size of the PAH also increases but this is still less than
10 kcal/mol. It is proposed and supported herein that an incoming
molecule can bond with the noble gas atom adsorbed onto the PAH, form
a stable structure, and allow the PAH to function as the leaving group.
This work shows that the noble gas molecules ArCCH+, ArOH+, ArNH+, and NeCCH+ are not only stable
minima on their respective potential energy surfaces but also can
be formed in either the gas phase or through PAH adsorption with known
or hypothesized interstellar molecules. Most notably, NeCCH+ does not appear to form in the gas phase but could be catalyzed
on PAH surfaces. Hence, the interstellar detection of such molecules
could also serve as a probe for the observation of interstellar PAHs.

Introduction
Noble gases form covalent bonds1−7 and can be more inclined to do so through the employment of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Because of their inherent electronic
stability, it was believed to be unlikely for argon or any of the
noble gases to react and form stable bonds with nearly any other atom
or molecular system. However, the discovery of argonium (ArH+) in the Crab nebula8 and other astronomical
sources within the interstellar medium (ISM)9 has shown that this basic tenant of chemistry is not always true.
The very concept of noble gas molecules opens new possibilities and
ideas for current and future astrochemistry.

40Ar
is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth
as it is believed to decay radioactively from atomic electrolytes
in seawater. However, extraterrestrial argon is primarily 36Ar and is the 11th most abundant element in space.1036Ar forms during stellar nucleosynthesis of
stars, more massive than our sun. The ionization potential of argon
is relatively high at 360 kcal/mol.4,9 Therefore,
argon mostly exists neutrally in the diffuse ISM but can be ionized
via cosmic rays.2,3,8 Its
proton affinity is larger than that of atomic hydrogen, indicating
that ionized argon could produce ArH+ in clouds of atomic
hydrogen without dissociating.9,11,12 Additionally, the dissociation of argonium is remarkably slow allowing
for it to exist longer than either of the predicted HeH+ or NeH+ molecules. Consequently, ArH+ has
been suggested as a tracer for interstellar atomic gas.9,13 The question remains as to whether or not other noble gas molecules
can form and be detected in the ISM.

Studies on the possibility
of forming noble gas molecules have
existed for over half a century. The first noble gas molecule created
in the laboratory was xenon tetraflouride (XeF4) by reacting
xenon gas with flourine (Xe + 2F2 → XeF4).14 Another significant noble gas molecule
HArF is formed by dissociating HF within a solid argon matrix.15 For argon hydroflouride to remain stable, it
must be kept at temperatures not exceeding 17 K. The temperature of
molecular clouds in the diffuse ISM remains between 10 and 20 K, which
allows for the possibility of HArF to be detected therein. Additionally,
McKellar has conducted extensive research around the H2–Ar and D2–Ar complexes as well as similar
molecules containing other noble gas atoms.16−18 The spectral
data given within his earlier research denote that these complexes
are stable minima on their respective potential energy surfaces (PESs).

The issue with most of these compounds is that the larger noble
gas atoms are more likely to form bonds due to the polarizability
of the larger electron cloud.19−23 However, argon is the largest of the noble gases that will occur
in large numbers in interstellar environments. All other atoms in
this periodic table family are heavier than iron and form after stellar
nucleosynthesis. Consequently, the noble gas chemistry of the ISM
should focus on those compounds containing helium, neon, and argon.

One proposed pathway to the creation of the known interstellar
ArH+ cation is believed to be ionized argon reacting with
hydrogen gas. Previous quantum chemical computations in our group
have shown that this reaction scheme proceeds through the ArH2+ intermediate.11 ArH+ and the hydrogen atom exist 11.5 kcal/mol above this minimum.
However, Ne+ + H2 is more likely to form bare
neon atoms and H2+, with these products existing
11.5 kcal/mol above the NeH2+ minimum. Consequently,
NeH+ will not be nearly as abundant (if at all) as ArH+ as current analyses appear to support.13

To identify other likely noble gas molecules worthy
of interstellar
searches, it is necessary to understand what it takes to bond any
functional group/ligand with a noble gas atom. Further quantum chemical
research has since suggested a number of new noble gas molecules that
may exist in the ISM. All are cations that make the noble gas atoms
strong electron acceptors. These include ArOH+, NeOH+, ArNH+, ArH3+, and CHe2+.4,7,24 Each exists
as a minimum on its respective PES with bond strengths (measured from
proportional force constants) within significant percentages of those
from ArH+. Each of these species (except for ArH3+)25 forms strong bonds due
to polarization of the electron-poor valence cloud in the noble gas
atomic cation. Hence, in looking for new noble gas molecules, ligands
that can share electrons with noble gas cations must be considered
and these ligands must be donated from known or at least strongly
hypothesized interstellar molecules.

A number of potential molecules
that could serve these purposes
have already been detected in the ISM. The cyano radical (CN) was
one of the first molecules detected in space in 1940 and is one such
ligand.26 It is electron-rich and also
possesses a freely shared radical electron. NO was detected nearly
40 years later toward Sgr B2.27 The structure
of NO is similar to that of CN in that the atoms have multiple bonds
to one another and a radical electron that is, again, freely shared.
However, current work has highlighted the difficulty of getting the
oxygen atom in NO to cooperate in bonding.28 Another notable ligand is the C2H radical detected in
1974.29 C2H is isoelectronic,
with CN making it similarly electron-rich and open-shell. Even though
these fragments are promising to bind with neon and argon, any gas-phase
reaction must entail a leaving group to dissipate the additional kinetic
energy.

As a result, other molecules that contain these groups
must take
part in the chemical reaction. The ISM is known to contain various
molecules that may or may not exist on Earth, and this environment
likely holds many more than we already know. Any detected or likely
interstellar molecule that contains CN, NO, or C2H is a
candidate for reactions that lead to the desired noble gas, covalently
bonded molecular cation. HNC, HCNH+, HC3NH+, CN, HCN, and HC3N are all detected interstellar
molecules26,30−35 whose decomposition and recombination could be used to form the
ArCN+ molecule. For some potential reactants, the neutral
or charged isomer may not yet have been detected but it is likely
that they may still exist in lower abundances. ArNH+ is
another proposed molecule whose formation could involve ligands such
as HCN, HNC, HCNH+, NH, NH2, or HC3NH+.36,37 The creation of ArCCH+ is suggested to incorporate molecules including a C2H
group: C2H, C3H, HC3NH+, and HC3N.38 NeCCH+, like ArCCH+, is believed to be formed using the same
ligands reacting with neon.

PAHs have been suggested as receptacles
for noble gases under terrestrial
conditions and benzene rings have been shown to capture molecules
via π-cloud interactions with a binding energy on the order
of 25 kcal/mol.39 The noble gas atom bound
above the surface of a PAH is therefore a probable and adequate intermediate
for noble gas chemical reactions. The appropriate ligand could react
with the noble gas atom and form one of many speculated noble gas
molecules. The PAH and remaining atoms from the incoming molecule
would compose the leaving groups.

Although PAHs have not yet
been absolutely confirmed to exist in
the ISM, the conditions for their likely existence are present.40,41 Many of the hydrocarbons necessary for the formation of PAHs have
been detected inside carbon-rich stars40,42 and indirect
detection of PAHs has been suggested for many years.43,44 The main issue with direct detection of PAHs comes from the fact
that they are nearly impossible to distinguish uniquely but general
trends can be shown through databases of features fed through models
of different astrochemical environments.44

The purpose of this research is to predict the optimized geometries,
relative energies, and possible reaction schema of several noble gas
molecules. These include ArCN+, ArNH+, ArCCH+, and NeCCH+ with ArNH+ having been
explored recently for its rovibrational properties.24 Earlier theoretical work actually exists on these species.1 However, much of it is only at the Hartree–Fock
level and only analyzes the noble gas bond dissociations and not the
possible formation reactions. Although it may be possible for some
reactions to create noble gas molecular cations in the gas phase,
the adsorbed phase cannot be neglected. PAHs could adsorb the noble
gas atom within their electron cloud above the larger molecule’s
surface whereby a passing ligand could bind. All of these reactions
would require favorable energetics to indicate whether a final molecular
product could be observed. These possibilities pave the way for further
experimental and theoretical work to inform subsequent interstellar
observation.

Results and Discussion
The CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ
structures of the ultimate products explored
herein are shown in Figure 1. The structure and spectroscopic data regarding ArNH+ have already been determined at high level,24 and the present results are closely in line with those
from the previous work and from much earlier contributions.1 The vibrational frequencies of the four target
noble gas molecules are shown in Table 1 showcasing that these molecules are minima. The Ar–C
bonds in ArCCH+ and ArCN+ are similar to typical
third-row atom bonds with second-row atoms,45 and both molecules are perfectly linear. NeCCH+ is surprisingly
nonlinear confirming earlier reports.1 NeCCH+ is isoelectronic to FCCH+, fluoroacetylene, a
known linear molecule. The 1.715 Å Ne–C bond is similar
to the Ne–O bond in NeOH+, which is also nonlinear.4 However, the bending in NeCCH+ is
likely the result of weakening of one of the C–C π bonds
for the terminal carbon in CCH+ to share electrons with
the neon atom. In any case, this is somewhat an unexpected result
from the first observation.

Gas-Phase Reactions
In finding what
types of ligands
can form noble gas molecules in the gas phase, NO is a good place
to start because of its relative simplicity. Unfortunately, NO is
not a stable ligand in the formation of ArNO+, ArON+, NeNO+, or NeON+ because no CCSD(T)
geometries could be optimized with noble gas–NO bond lengths
of less than 3.0 Å. Hence, NO does not produce covalently bonded
minima with these noble gas atoms. The reason is due to the recoupled
pair bonding present in oxygen that does not allow for strong bonds
to be made with half of its distended lone pair.28 As disappointing as creating a molecule that is an anagram
of itself in NeON+ is, the possible existence of other
noble gas molecules is still exciting.

Next, ArNH+ is a stable minimum on its PES as has been previously shown through
rovibrational analysis.24 Here, the energetics
supports its candidacy as a viable interstellar molecule. Of the potential,
interstellar noble gas molecules studied thus far, ArNH+ is actually the most stable with respect to breaking the noble gas
bond. ArNH+ lies 113.5 kcal/mol below the separated argon
atom and NH+ molecular cation reactants. This is even greater
than the dissociation energy of ArH+ at 94.0 kcal/mol and
also ArOH+ at 73.7 kcal/mol.4 Therefore, ArNH+ has the potential to form in the ISM
without spontaneous dissociation. Indeed, the dissociation of ArNH+ into Ar+ and neutral NH is more favorable from
a stability perspective but this is less likely to take place due
to the already high ionization potential of argon. In terms of creation,
the best pathway for the actual formation of ArNH+ comes
from neutral argon reacting with NH2+. This
process has a total reaction energy of −68.2 kcal/mol and the
leaving group is a sole hydrogen atom. The creation of ArNH+ from ionized argon and the NH2 radical is also possible
at −30.2 kcal/mol. However, other reactants shown in Table 2 for the creation
of ArNH+ that require breaking a C–N bond are not
favorable and will not allow for the stable creation of ArNH+ in the gas phase.

Next, ArCN+ also exists as a minimum on the [Ar, C,
N] PES with a dissociation energy of −52.8 kcal/mol into neutral
Ar and CN+ as shown in Table 2. Its most likely mode of gas-phase formation
is through ionized argon reacting with HCN producing ArCN+, a hydrogen atom, and −32.2 kcal/mol of energy. It is somewhat
surprising that the dissociation of HNC or HNC+ is actually
less favorable, even promoting the reactants over the products. As
shown in Table 2, ArCN+ is not exoergically favored through any other tested reaction.
Those reactions containing Ar+ as a product have the lowest
energy but are still likely kinetically disfavored.

ArCCH+ is the second-most stable with respect to breaking
the noble gas bond of the systems analyzed in this work. It lies 67.0
kcal/mol below argon and ionized C2H+. In the
gas-phase creation of ArCCH+, however, the pathway with
the best energetics is the reaction of Ar+ with HC2NC, yielding ArCCH+ and CN as a leaving group as
well as only −7.6 kcal/mol of excess energy. The only other
reactants that could potentially produce the desired molecule are
those containing a C2 group reacting with a charged argon
atom, HC2H and HC3N, but both reactions are
endoergic.

NeCCH+ is the only neon system analyzed
here that is
a stable molecule as shown in Table 3. It is computationally predicted to be a minimum on
its PES, requiring 21.8 kcal/mol of energy to break the Ne–C
bond. Despite this, there exist no favorable exoergic pathways for
the tested set of reactants for their formation in the gas phase.
The closest possibility, at 152.4 kcal/mol, is with neon reacting
with acetylene cation producing NeCCH+ and a sole hydrogen
atom. Even so, such an energy barrier could almost never be overcome
in natural environments where other bonds would not be broken as well.

Previous work has found
that NeOH+ is a stable system
with a reaction energy of −12.3 kcal/mol favoring NeOH+4 but NeNH+ is not a
stable system.24 Despite the promise of
NeOH+, no pathways could be produced from the set of tested
molecules that could form NeOH+ in the gas phase. As a
fascinating side result of this work, the present set of computations
indicate that HOCO + Ar+ will produce ArOH+ and
the astronomically ubiquitous carbon monoxide with a relative energy
of −211.1 kcal/mol, greater than the proposed HOOH + Ar+ mechanism,4 which produces only
−28.6 kcal/mol. Finally, the gas-phase reactions are not highly
susceptible to zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) corrections, especially
from a qualitative sense. The ZPVE for the creation of ArCN+ is small at 1.7 kcal/mol and increases to 6.7 kcal/mol for NeCCH+ as shown in Table 4. Hence, the exoergicity of these reactions will not be affected
by the ZPVEs, which are exceedingly difficult to compute for the large
PAH complexes discussed in the below section. The ZPVEs of the adsorbed
complexes will also be quite small as most of the ZPVEs is contained
within the PAH itself, and this molecule is largely unchanged either
as a reactant or π-complex product.

Adsorbed PAH Reactions
Even though the neon cation
of interest (NeCCH+) is indeed a stable molecule, the lack
of a viable gas-phase reaction channel limits the possibility of this
cation occurring in nature. However, it may yet be possible for the
noble gas atoms themselves to be presented to a matching ligand by
adsorbing onto the surface of a PAH. Because the PAHs are so large,
CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ computations are prohibitive for the analysis
of such systems. As mentioned previously, the DF-MP2/6-31+G* level
of theory has given much promise in extending wave function-based
quantum chemistry to such systems where previously only density functional
theory could be utilized. To verify that DF-MP2/6-31+G* is appropriate
for application to those systems where adsorption may be required
for molecular synthesis, the gas-phase dissociation energies computed
with both methods are shown in Table 4. DF-MP2/6-31+G* overestimates the noble gas bond energy
in ArCCH+ as well as NeCCH+ relative to CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ.
On the whole, however, the significantly less computationally costly
density-fitting (DF) approach is capable of producing at least semiquantitatively
meaningful results for further analysis.

PAHs allow for a noble
gas molecule to be adsorbed onto their surface relatively easily.39 An incoming ligand could bond to the noble gas
exoergically by subsequently severing the van der Waals bond between
the noble gas atom and the PAH π cloud. To estimate such behavior
for PAHs in general, a succession of larger, commonly utilized PAH
examples are employed. These include naphthalene, pyrene, coronene,
and ovalene with two, four, seven, and ten, respectively, six-membered
rings. All have the ability to adsorb a noble gas atom into their
π clouds and do so with successively stronger interactions as
the number of rings increases. Neon, for instance, binds to naphthalene
with a mere −1.9 kcal/mol as shown in Table 5. Inclusion of the ZPVE for this, the smallest
complex, reduces the binding energy further by −0.2 to −2.1
kcal/mol as the only new frequencies for the products are for the
Ne motion adsorbed to the PAH. These lie at 46.2, 49.7, and 58.7 cm–1, whereas the naphthalene frequencies are all changed
by negligible amounts upon complexation. The 77.3 cm–1 or 0.2 kcal/mol ZPVE reduction is an absolutely small change that
will not affect the semiquantitative conclusions drawn in this work.

The binding energy
increases in magnitude to −4.1 kcal/mol
for pyrene, −5.6 kcal/mol for coronene, and −6.8 kcal/mol
for ovalene as shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8,
respectively, indicating that it should stabilize somewhere around
−8.0 kcal/mol for arbitrarily large PAHs. Argon is slightly
more tightly bound with energies of −3.1, −6.5, −8.8,
and −10.1 kcal/mol, respectively, of the four, ever-larger
PAHs. Hence, its PAH binding energy to larger PAHs probably converges
to around −11.5 kcal/mol. Such energies will likely require
that any noble gas–PAH adsorption for subsequent chemistry
will need to be in cold, dark molecular clouds like TMC-1, where such
complexes will likely have lifetimes on the order of multiple years.
In each case of Ar or Ne adsorption, the atoms are each placed in
various positions around the PAH surface, but all migrate to the same
favorable positions on each PAH upon optimization. For naphthalene,
this is within the π cloud above a single ring, but directly
above the center of mass/charge for pyrene, coronene, and ovalene.
Any basis set superposition errors (BSSE) for these complexes are
small and will not change the conclusions drawn. BSSEs for the neon
complexes with naphthalene and pyrene computed via the counterpoise
correction are both less than 0.1 kcal/mol, whereas the BSSEs for
the argon complexes are 0.2 and 0.5 kcal/mol, respectively.

The CCH+ ligand binds exceptionally tightly to naphthalene.
Even so, the neon atom can interrupt this binding. If the reaction
starts from the neon atom bound to naphthalene with CCH+ as the second reactant, NeCCH+ and the naphthalene molecule
will be produced exoergically with a relative energy of −42.5
kcal/mol. Optimizations of the three chemical fragments (naphthalene,
the neon atom, and CCH+) as one system are not stable,
indicating that this must be a bimolecular reaction. Although it is
unlikely for all the three items to collide at once in the diffuse
regions of the ISM, if the neon atom is already adsorbed onto naphthalene,
this process could lead to the creation of another naturally occurring
noble gas molecule. Furthermore, if NeCCH+ could be detected,
its formation is unlikely in the gas phase as highlighted above. Hence,
some type of adsorptive catalysis would be required to form this molecular
cation and would imply that NeCCH+ could be a probe of
PAH density.

Interestingly, as the size of the PAH grows, the
formation of NeCCH+ becomes less favorable. It is the inverse
relationship of
the binding energy for the noble gas atom adsorbed onto the PAH surface.
Consequently, ovalene (Table 8) has the least favorable reaction energy for the PAH-Ne +
CCH+ → PAH + NeCCH+ processes at −37.3
kcal/mol. However, the asymptotic convergence of the noble gas PAH
binding implies that such a reaction on a large PAH surface would
be exoergic by around −35.0 kcal/mol, enough for NeCCH+ to form with aid of any arbitrarily sized PAH.

Similar
trends are observed for ArCCH+ but conditions
are over twice as favorable for its creation on naphthalene at −99.7
kcal/mol. Even
when considering the use of ovalene as the adsorbing surface, the
PAH-Ar + CCH+ → PAH + ArCCH+ reaction
still produces −92.7 kcal/mol of favorable energy, significantly
more than in the gas-phase reaction of HC2NC and ionized
argon at −7.6 kcal/mol. Even though ArCCH+ is a
strongly bound noble gas cation, it may require some surface chemistry
to form, again, giving indication of the molecular environment in
which it would be detected.

The formations of NeOH+, ArOH+, and ArNH+ from known interstellar
reactants along with noble gas atomic
cations are more favored in the gas phase from present and previous4 works. However,
the creation of NeCCH+, ArCCH+, and ArCN+ is required (in the case of the neon molecule), and enhanced
(in the case of the two argon molecules) when PAH adsorption is involved
in the formation pathway. It is unlikely that the noble gas dihydride
and trihydride cations will benefit from PAH adsorption. Consequently,
any observation of ArH2+ will likely be as the
intermediate in the creation of the known ArH+ either from
atomic argon and the hydrogen molecular cation or from the isoergic
ionized atomic argons reacting with neutral ubiquitous H2.11

Computational Details
Quantum chemistry provides unique insights into the relative energetics
of chemical reactions. It can determine the favorability of certain
schema to provide useful data for chemical modeling of the ISM. The
first step is to determine potential reaction schema. Next, the geometries
of each involved chemical structure must be computed. These include
all reactants, desired products, and other leaving groups. The
gas-phase reactions are modeled with coupled cluster theory at the
single, double, and perturbative triple [CCSD(T)]46−48 levels, along
with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set.49,50 CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ
has been documented as the “gold standard” of quantum
chemistry for producing exceptional accuracy for a modest computational
cost.51,52 The reaction energy is then determined using
the standard chemical reaction equation of products minus reactants. The
desired molecule as well as the leaving group is on the products side,
whereas the noble gas atom or atomic cation along with the appropriate
ligand-donating species is the reactant. The reported negative energies
favor products, whereas positive energies favor reactants. All geometries
are verified as minima on the respective energy surfaces by producing
all real harmonic vibrational frequencies also at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ
level. The requisite open-shell computations utilize the restricted
open-shell Hartree–Fock reference wave function,53−55 whereas the closed-shell, even-numbered electron computations rely
upon simply the restricted Hartree–Fock reference wave function.56 All computations make use of the PSI4 quantum
chemistry package.57

DF algorithms
promise to reduce the computational cost with little
sacrifice in accuracy,58 and Møller–Plesset
perturbation theory at second-order (MP2)59 with a double-zeta basis set has been shown to produce surprising
accuracy for such a simple method.60,61 Additionally,
the DF-MP2 analytical derivative algorithms within the binary release
of PSI4 are exceptionally fast, opening wave function-based methods
to larger molecules.62 Consequently, DF-MP2/6-31+G*
calculations63 are utilized for the geometry
optimizations and relative energetic computations of the reaction
schema that employ PAHs. Such an approach is advantageous because
of the large number of atoms in these molecules and their multiple
electrons included therein. The noble gas (argon or neon in this case)
is then adsorbed onto the surface of the PAH. Once the geometry of
this has been optimized, its relative energy is recorded and standard
chemical energetics determined.

Conclusions
Noble
gas atoms can actually undergo chemical reactions in both gas and
adsorbed phases. As ArH+ is a known example of noble gas
chemistry occurring on galactic scales across the ISM, the next step
is to determine how other such species could be formed, and through
what means it is possible to identify them. The second of these two
considerations is left for quartic force field work in progress, but
gas phase, quantum chemically computed reactions utilizing CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ
show that all of the tested molecules, ArCCH+, ArCN+, ArNH+, and NeCCH+, are minima on their
respective PESs. In fact, ArNH+ has a Ar–N bond
energy greater than even the known ArH+ astromolecule.
Furthermore, the reaction of NH2+ + Ar →
ArNH+ + H has a relative reaction energy of −68.2
kcal/mol, making it 3.5 times more exoergic than the formation of
ArH+ from Ar+ + H2. Consequently,
the previous work describing the rovibrational spectroscopic data24 for ArNH+ is vital in the detection
of this molecule in interstellar environments where NH2+ is already known.

Other favorable gas-phase reaction
schema are discovered herein
for the other two argon noble gas molecules but not for NeCCH+. For NeCCH+ to form, surface adsorption catalysis
is required. The noble gas atoms make weak but stable bonds with the
π cloud above or below the plane of the PAH. The larger the
PAH, the stronger the bonds become. The larger the PAH, the more kinetic
energy will be required to dissociate the noble gas, but these energies
are still fairly low. In any case, the PAH leaving group allows noble
gas molecules to form, even NeCCH+. Although the argon
counterpart, ArCCH+, and its isoelectronic companion, ArCN+, do not require a PAH to form with energetically favorable
chemistry, the PAH surfaces can enhance their interstellar synthesis.
Additionally, the detection of such systems in a given region would
provide further evidence for the presence of PAHs. The formations
of ArNH+ and ArCN+ are also more likely than
ArCCH+, as well, because ionized argon is not required
for the reactants.

Noble gas chemistry is not a laboratory curiosity
any longer, but
stable noble gas species are still difficult to analyze. This quantum
chemical work provides a basis for future exploration of other noble
gas molecules that may yet be lurking in the expanses of space.
