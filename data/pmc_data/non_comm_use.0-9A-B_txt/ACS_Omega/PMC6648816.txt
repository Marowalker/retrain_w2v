We
report the photophysical properties of a synthetic asymmetric
azine-based compound (17Z,18E)-4′-((E)-3-phenylallylidene)-1′-(dimethylamino)-1-((pyren-8-yl)methylene)hydrazine
(PYNC). The molecule PYNC shows an appreciable
red shift in the emission maximum in a wide range of solvents. In
water, PYNC shows the characteristic feature of excimer
formation exclusively. However, in all other solvents, the excimer
band is present alongside the charge transfer emission band. The assignment
of charge transfer and excimer bands has been established by various
steady-state emission spectral data. PYNC, owing to this
novel excimer-coupled charge transfer phenomenon, can be a potential
probe for studying various supramolecular assemblies of biological
interest.

1 Introduction
Synthesis
of molecules purposefully designed to exhibit a particular
excited-state phenomenon has been of significant interest to physical
chemists. Reports on synthesis of molecules capable of exhibiting
interesting photophysical phenomena such as excited-state intramolecular
proton transfer (PT),1−3 excited-state intramolecular charge transfer (ICT),4−6 and an interplay between the above two7−9 are plentiful in the
literature. Because the polarity sensitivity of an ICT probe is great
due to large dipole moment incurred by the same in the excited state,
it is often employed as a sensor to study biologically relevant systems.10,11 A very well known fluorophore that exhibits a rare photophysical
phenomenon of excimer formation is pyrene.12 Synthesis of molecules containing pyrene is often associated with
the recently discovered aggregation-induced emission (AIE).13,14 Pyrene-containing probes are often employed for analytical purposes
such as sensing of environmentally relevant analytes15 and also for probing their interaction with DNA, the building
block of life.16 More often than not, these
interactions are revealed by the modulation of the characteristic
band corresponding to the pyrene excimer.17,18 At this juncture, the probes capable of displaying ICT and excimer
formation could be important.

Throughout the years, novel probes
have been reported that show
interplay between excited-state ICT and PT processes.19−21 However, no group has reported molecules that are capable of showing
ICT and excimer formation simultaneously. Keeping this in mind, we
report the synthesis and detailed photophysical study of a newly designed
organic compound (17Z,18E)-4′-((E)-3-phenylallylidene)-1′-(dimethylamino)-1-((pyren-8-yl)methylene)hydrazine
(PYNC). PYNC contains a pyrene unit linked
to a (4-dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde unit by an azine linker (Figure 1). The rationale
behind choosing pyrene was its ability to show excimer emission. On
the other hand, (4-dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde as well as its derivatives
shows interesting excited-state charge transfer (CT) characteristics.22,23 Furthermore, polyaromatic hydrocarbons like pyrene can accept or
donate electronic charge depending on the tailoring of the environment.
Hence, we considered coupling of (4-dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde with
pyrene with the anticipation of observing excimer formation along
with the ICT process. The synthetic route for PYNC comprises
two elementary steps and results in high yield of the product. Detailed
photophysical studies show that PYNC exhibits a considerable
polarity-dependent red shift in its emission maxima with a Stokes
shift value ranging from ∼5480 cm–1 (in chloroform)
to ∼7750 cm–1 (in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO))
with quite higher excited-state dipole moment value than that in the
ground state. Interestingly, PYNC prominently showed
a single emission band, characteristic of the pyrene excimer in water
at ∼478 nm, although the same band was present in other solvents
too. The occurrence of the excimer and the ICT phenomenon were established
by recording the steady-state emission profiles of PYNC in binary solvent systems with varying composition for each component.
Time-resolved experiments were also performed to gain further insight
into the excited-state photophysical processes operating in PYNC. Prior to this report, there was a single available report
of a probe consisting of a dimethylamino group as a donor and a pyrene
unit as an acceptor.24 However, the reported
probe exclusively exhibited excited-state charge transfer with no
excimer formation. Thus, PYNC stands out to be a unique
molecule where excimer formation and ICT take place simultaneously
and can be a potential probe for monitoring biologically relevant
systems in future.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Compounds
Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic
outline of (17Z,18E)-4′-((E)-3-phenylallylidene)-1′-(dimethylamino)-1-((pyren-8-yl)methylene)hydrazine
(PYNC). Pyrene-1-carboxaldehyde hydrazone was prepared
using the reported synthetic procedure,15 used without further characterization, and condensed with (4-dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde
in ethanol medium. The detailed synthetic procedure is provided in
the Supporting Information. PYNC was characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and
electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS) (Figures S1–S3). The purity was checked
by thin-layer chromatography analysis.

2.2 Steady-State Spectral Measurements
The steady-state absorption profiles of PYNC were recorded
in solvents of varying polarity (Figure 2a). PYNC shows a high-energy
band at 293 nm irrespective of solvents and a low-energy band that
shows a slight shift in absorption maxima with polarity of the solvent,
as listed in Table 1. The absorbance values were low in polar aprotic and protic solvents.
The low-energy band was assigned to S0–S1 and the high-energy band to S0–S2,
which was in accordance with previously reported cinnamaldehyde derivatives.22,23

Because compounds containing dimethylamino
substitution show acid
susceptibility in the ground state, the effect of acid was observed
in acetonitrile medium (Figure 2b). Addition of a strong acid (trifluoroacetic acid, TFA;
0–1.0 μM) to PYNC resulted in decrement
of the band at ∼425 nm with the appearance of a new band at
∼565 nm and an isosbestic point at ∼480 nm. The appearance
of the red-shifted band could be a result of protonation of the azine
N2 and/or the N3 atom(s) (Figure 1), resulting in extensive delocalization of charge
from the NMe2 group to the N atoms. The protonation of
azine N atoms over the NMe2 group is more likely due to
the α effect prevalent in the two N atoms of the azine linkage
(Scheme 2). Of the
two N atoms, the one closer to the cinnamaldehyde unit (N2, Figure 1) is more likely
to be protonated because the electron density on N2 is expected to
be much more because of the mesomeric effect of the NMe2 moiety. This is supported from the Mulliken charge densities on
the two N atoms (Figure S4). The electron-rich
nature of the said N2 atom is also hinted by the lower chemical shift
value of the same in the 1H NMR spectrum of PYNC (Figure S1). However, the appearance
of the red-shifted band due to addition of acid confirms that the
low-energy absorption band is not due to the n−π* transition.25 As evident from the structure of PYNC, there are no base-susceptible units. As a result, there was practically
no effect upon addition of base (triethylamine) in acetonitrile medium
(Figure 2c).

Scheme 2 Effect
of Addition of Acid to PYNC
Following the absorption spectral measurements, the steady-state
emission profiles were recorded in various solvents (Figure 3a and Table 1), the excitation wavelength being 420 nm
in each case. The emission in chloroform medium is found to be dual
in nature, with one high-energy band at ∼475 nm, whereas a
low-energy band appears at 545 nm. However, the existence of dual
nature of emission in PYNC is better realized as polarity
of the solvents increased (Figure 3). Interestingly, whereas the energy of the high-energy
band remains comparatively less altered (Table 1), the low-energy band undergoes a steady
shift in its maxima. As evident from Figure 3, the red-shifted band in dichloromethane
(DCM) is at ∼566 nm, which undergoes a massive red shift to
attain a value of ∼623 nm in dimethyl sulfoxide, indicating
that PYNC experiences an enhanced solvent stabilization
(dielectric stabilization) that may be due to a higher dipole moment
in the excited state.26 To ascertain this,
the excited-state dipole moment value was calculated using the following
Lippert–Mataga equation27  . The terms bear their usual significance.
The value of Onsager cavity radius (a) was obtained
to be 5.81 Å from the volume calculation of the optimized structure
using the Gaussian 09 package. The ground-state dipole moment (μG) was found out to be 4.97 D from the calculated optimized
structure. The Stokes shift values of the polarity-dependent band
were used for constructing the plot (Figure 3b). Afterwards, the excited-state dipole
moment was calculated to be 12.01 D, which is almost 2.5 times higher
than the ground-state dipole moment. This high value of dipole moment
in the excited state along with the large Stokes shift values indicates
the presence of excited-state intramolecular charge transfer in PYNC. To fortify our assumptions, emission spectra of PYNC were recorded in the chloroform/methanol binary solvent
system, with the concentration of PYNC fixed (Figure 3c). The results clearly
showed that introduction of 20% of methanol caused a massive red shift
of the low-energy band by ∼40 nm, indicating the sensitivity
of the low-energy band of PYNC toward polarity of a medium.
To verify the effect of H-bonding on the polarity-dependent band in PYNC, the emission maximum values were plotted against the
H-bonding parameter of the solvents (α) (Figure 4a). The influence of solvent polarity on
the emission of PYNC was verified by plotting the emission
maxima against the ET(30) parameter of
solvents23 (Figure 4b). From Figure 4b, it is obvious that there are two types
of interaction in the excited state: one is dipolar interaction, whereas
the other is hydrogen bonding interaction. Whether the charge transfer
phenomenon is solely restricted to the excited state was checked by
recording the excitation spectra of PYNC in various solvents
(Figure S5). Because PYNC exhibited
dual emission in all solvents except water, it was to be checked whether
the charge transfer could be explained by the twisted intramolecular
charge transfer (TICT) model.28 Had the
photophysics of PYNC been only guided by the TICT model,
then the high-energy band could be due to the local emission of the
probe.29 However, two perturbing questions
remained pertinent: (a) a single band for water, whereas other protic
solvents showed dual emission and (b) appearance of a prominent dual
emission band in the less polar solvent like dichloromethane as opposed
to the probe following TICT emission.29 Because PYNC contains pyrene, we have tried to verify
whether the high-energy band is due to the monomer or pyrene excimer
as pyrene is reported to form excimer in water compared with other
protic solvents.30 Bains reported the pyrene
monomer emission peak at 375–405 nm and excimer peak at ∼460
nm.30 Zelent et al. have shown how the
pyrene excimer is exclusively formed in pyrene–carboxylic acid
upon deprotonation by losing the monomer band.30 The presence of carboxylic moiety in pyrene–carboxylic
acid alters the electronic density on pyrene nucleus, thus preventing
monomer emission in the above case. In the case of our current molecule PYNC, when it is present in the monomer form, it will undergo
prompt charge transfer in solvents. This occurs because of sufficient
difference in Mulliken charge density between the dimethylamino moiety
and the imine moiety adjacent to the pyrene moiety. This charge transfer
prevents the monomer formation in PYNC. The charge transfer
process also prevents the excimer formation, as evident from the lesser
intensity of the excimer band in solvents like methanol and acetonitrile.
However, in the case of water, the charge transfer is suppressed because
of solvation of the N atoms of the dimethylamino moiety as well as
the azine linkage. Hence, excimer formation is exclusive. This is
commonly encountered in the case of the bare pyrene molecule, where
almost exclusive excimer emission is observed in water. Due to the
electron-pushing dimethylamino moiety, there is either charge transfer
or excimer formation depending on the solvent system. Hence, the position
of the high-energy band also hinted at the possibility of excimer
formation by PYNC as pyrene excimers are found between
420 and 500 nm depending on the substitution.31 To confirm the possibility of excimer, emission profiles of PYNC were recorded in binary solvent systems methanol/water
(Figure 5a) and acetonitrile/water
(Figure S6). Results of the experiment
were qualitatively the same for both cases; the addition of water
diminished the CT band, and the high-energy band experienced increment
in intensity. The color of the solutions under UV light (Figure 5b) gradually changed
from red (100% methanol) to dark blue (100% water) with increasing
volume percentage of water. This was followed by concentration increment
experiment in three solvents: methanol, water (Figure 6a,b), and acetonitrile (Figure S7). The results clearly indicated that the increasing
concentration of probe in solvents other than water contributes to
increment of the high-energy emission band, thereby making the possibilities
of the high-energy band due to excimer more prominent. To further
fortify that the higher-energy band is due to the excimer, the effect
of viscosity on PYNC in the binary solvent system was
observed using water and poly(ethylene glycol) 400 (PEG400) as components
(Figure 7a). With an
increase in the viscosity of the medium, which is proportional to
the volume percentage of PEG400 in the mixture, the high-energy band
diminishes gradually with an increment of a band at ∼590 nm.
The results strongly indicate the well-known observation of rupture
of the intermolecular excimer upon increment in viscosity.32 With an increase in the viscosity of the medium,
the molecules of PYNC would be unable to form excimer.
On the other hand, increment of viscosity freezes the single-bond
rotational motions in PYNC, a flexible motion responsible
for nonradiative energy dissipation, thereby increasing the charge
transfer phenomenon in the same, an observation in line with that
reported earlier in cinnamaldehyde-bearing charge transfer probes.23 However, the red-shifted band, i.e., the ICT
band, underwent a blue shift of ∼10 nm when compared with other
protic solvents. The reason lies in the reduction of the static dielectric
constant of the water–PEG400 mixture upon increment in the
PEG400 volume fraction.33 Because ICT probes
are extremely susceptible to the dielectric of the bulk medium, the
reduction of the same causes the observed blue shift (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Effect of Viscosity on the Emission Characteristics of PYNC
Because pyrene-bearing
fluorophores are often reported to exhibit
aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties, the chance of AIE was
to be nullified for the high-energy band to be assigned to the excimer.
Because emission maxima of AIE are reported to be the same in the
solid state as also in water,34−36 the solid-state emission spectrum
of PYNC was recorded and compared to the same in water
(Figure 7b). PYNC was found to be totally nonfluorescent in the solid state.
Thus, it could be concluded that the high-energy band was due to the
pyrene excimer and the polarity-sensitive band was due to excited-state
intramolecular charge transfer in PYNC.

To observe
whether addition of acid had any effect on the emission
spectrum of PYNC, dilute TFA was added to an acetonitrile
solution of PYNC (Figure 8). Upon gradual addition of acid, the ITC band undergoes
a decrease in intensity along with the generation of a broad band
centered at around 500 nm. This new observation seemed anomalous as
the excimer band was found to be at ∼485 nm in acetonitrile.
This was rationalized by considering that addition of acid results
in protonation of imine linkage, thereby resulting in the loss of
conjugation between the cinnamaldehyde and pyrene unit. As a consequence,
the pyrene unit in PYNC behaves as a free pyrene unit.
Reports are available in the literature where the excimer band of
pyrene appeared near 500 nm when it is present as the sole fluorophore
unit.37,38 Subsequently, the fluorescence excitation
spectra of the bands at 600 and ∼485 nm were recorded in the
presence of acid, furnishing bands at ∼420 and ∼380
nm, respectively (Figure S8). The appearance
of the band at ∼380 nm strongly indicated that the pyrene unit
behaves as a separate entity in PYNC when treated with
acid. This is because the free pyrene molecule displays a broad absorption
band at ∼380 nm.39 It is noteworthy
that excitation of the lowest-energy band (∼565 nm) generated
after addition of acid in the UV-titration experiment did not result
in generation of an emission band. Thus, steady-state absorption and
emission experiments revealed the novelty of PYNC owing
to the simultaneous existence of excimer and excited ICT state in
the same molecule, which makes it a potential candidate for probing
biomimetic systems.

of PYNC in acetonitrile.

2.3 Excited-State Lifetime Measurements
To further dissect PYNC, decay kinetics of the same
in the excited state was observed by measuring excited-state lifetime
values. The decay profiles were monitored by exciting the sample using
an excitation wavelength of 375 nm irrespective of the solvent system,
followed by measuring decay time at two bands as observed in the emission
profiles of PYNC (Figure 9a). The average lifetime (⟨τ⟩)
values were calculated using the equation  where αi’s refer to the
relative contribution and τi’s
refer to the lifetime of the individual
species.

Figure 9 Excited-state decay profiles of PYNC in various solvents
when monitored at (a) excimer band and (b) CT band (λex = 375 nm in both cases).

When the excimer band was monitored, a biexponential nature
of
decay was observed in all solvents except water, where monoexponential
decay having a considerably long lifetime was obtained (Table 2). Although it was expected
that the excimer band when monitored will furnish strictly monoexponential
decay, all solvents bearing water showed biexponential decay, as stated
earlier. This could possibly be due to formation of some excited-state
complex with the solvent molecules, the shorter component thus corresponding
to the excited PYNC–solvent complex (PYNC–sol*) and the longer component due to the excimer
decay. Because PYNC–sol* is larger
in size, it is more likely to collide with other solvent molecules,
thereby furnishing the short-lived component.40,41 However, for water, no such solvent-induced complexation occurs,
mainly due to the poor solvation of PYNC by water molecules,
thereby furnishing exclusively excimer decay in the said solvent.

a a1 =
3% and a2 = 5% (a1 and a2 are standard deviation
values).

While monitoring
the CT band, biexponential decay was observed
in all solvents and was found to be very short lived (Figure 9b). Upon deconvoluting the
decay profiles, lifetime components were obtained that fall below
the instrumental response function. For this reason, the average lifetime
value has been considered while monitoring the CT state (Table 3). The average lifetime
of a species in the excited state signifies the time spent by the
species in that particular state before coming to the ground state.
The average lifetime value increases upon attaining stabilization
in the excited state. After excited-state deactivation processes such
as collision and activation of nonradiative channels, the average
lifetime value decreases. A perusal of the average lifetime values
reveals that with increment in polarity of the solvents the excited-state
lifetime increases, signifying the stability of the CT state in polar
solvents. However, the average lifetime of PYNC experiences
a decrement in protic solvents. This could be due to the activation
of nonradiative decay channels mediated by the hydrogen bonding interaction
of PYNC with this class of solvents.

a A = B = 5% (A and B are standard deviation
values).

The water increment
experiment in the binary mixture comprising
MeOH and water was conducted in the excited state to observe how the
average excited-state lifetime increases with an increment in water
fraction (Figure 10). As the water percentage increased, the average lifetime underwent
steady increment along with strictly monoexponential nature after
70% water content (Table 4). The above results indicate that exclusive excimer decay
occurs once the percentage fraction of water supersedes that of methanol.
In this connection, it is to be mentioned that although excimer emission
of pyrene is associated with an average lifetime on the order of 100
ns,42 the lifetime of PYNC is sufficiently short compared to that of pure pyrene. However,
in the case of long-chain pyrene compounds,43 as also in conjugated pyrene derivatives,44 the average lifetime of the excimer is reported to be reduced.

2.4 Theoretical Calculations
Because PYNC exhibits
a rare phenomenon of excited-state intramolecular
charge transfer coupled with excimer emission, we decided to optimize
the structure of PYNC as planarity of a molecule ensures
the charge transfer phenomenon. The optimized structure of PYNC (Figure 1) shows
a perfect linear alignment of the cinnamaldehyde unit with the pyrene
unit. Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) diagrams (Figure 11) reveal the transfer of electronic charge
density from the cinnamaldehyde moiety to pyrene. To find out the
stability of PYNC in the ground state, the HOMO–LUMO
gap was calculated and was found to be 2.7608 eV (Figure 11). As shortly discussed earlier,
Mulliken charge densities were considered for the N atoms in PYNC (Figure S4). The higher negative
charge density on the N2 atom than on N3 suggests the transmission
of charge from the dimethylamino moiety to the pyrene unit through
the azine linkage.

and LUMO diagrams.

3 Conclusions
Synthesis and detailed photophysical dissection of a novel pyrene–dimethylamino
cinnamaldehyde conjugate PYNC have been discussed. PYNC shows an excellent charge transfer emission band in the
excited state manifested by a high value of the excited-state dipole
moment along with appreciable Stokes’ shift in solvents of
varying polarity. PYNC also exhibits excimer formation
in almost all solvents along with formation of charge transfer states
having characteristic solvent-dependent emission. The excimer-coupled
charge transfer phenomenon was established by various steady-state
emission spectroscopic experiments. However, in water, exclusive excimer
emission is observed. The excited-state lifetime values were also
determined to gain an insight into the excited-state decay kinetics
of PYNC. Theoretical calculations have been performed
for finding out the planarity as well as the HOMO–LUMO gap
in the ground state of PYNC. Due to its polarity and
viscosity sensitivity, PYNC can be employed in future
for probing various biomimetic assemblies.

Methods
4.1 Instruments and Methods
NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker Advanced Supercon 300 MHz NMR spectrophotometer
using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Steady-state UV–vis
absorption profiles were recorded on a Hitachi U-3501 spectrophotometer.
Steady-state emission and excited-state decay profiles were recorded
on PerkinElmer LS-55 and Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoroCube-01-NL, respectively.
Mass spectrometry was carried out in a Waters Xevo G2-S Q TOF mass
spectrometer. Pyrene-1-aldehyde and (4-dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde
were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. Solvents
used were of spectroscopic grade. During steady-state absorption and
emission measurements, the concentration of the probe was maintained
at a micromolar range to avoid aggregation, reabsorption, or self-quenching.
All data were recorded at room temperature. The excited-state lifetime
measurements were carried out by exciting the sample using a picosecond
laser diode of 375 nm. The signals were obtained by setting the emission
polarizer at magic angle (54.7°) to prevent anisotropy, and the
decays were deconvoluted using DAS6 software. The goodness of fitting
was judged using χ2 criteria. The average lifetime
was calculated using standard procedures.45 The quantum yield values were calculated using Coumarin 153 as the
standard.46

4.2 Theoretical
Calculations
All theoretical
calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.47 To have an idea about the absolute configuration
of PYNC, we manually constructed its structure and optimized
it in the ground state in vacuum using 6-311++G(d,p).48 For optimized structure of PYNC in acetonitrile,
the polarizable continuum model was used using corresponding keywords
