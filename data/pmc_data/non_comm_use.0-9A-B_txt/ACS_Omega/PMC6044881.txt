Early
detection is the critical phase in the prognostic strategy
of various life-threatening maladies like infectious diseases and
cancer. The mortality rate caused by these diseases could be considerably
reduced if they were diagnosed in the early stages of disease development.
Carbon dots (C-dots), a relatively new and promising candidate in
the fluorescent nanomaterial category, possess a perceptible impact
on various bioapplications. Herein, we report a one-step facile hydrothermal
synthesis that yields a novel surface-passivated carbon dot (CDP)
from curcumin (as a green substrate) displaying high aqueous solubility.
The physico-chemical characterization of thus synthesized C-dots was
accomplished by an UV–visible spectrophotometer, fluorescence
spectrophotometer, zetasizer, TEM, and FE-SEM to understand the formation
of carbon dots with a 4–5 nm size near spherical nanoparticle
with high colloidal stability. E. coli DH5α
was engaged as the Gram-negative test organism and S. aureus as the Gram-positive in the biolabeling of bacteria. Cancer cell
lines including colon cancer (HCT-15), lung cancer (A549), and mouse
fibroblast (NIH 3T3) were evaluated and resulted in good biolabeling
potential and less cytotoxicity. Zebrafish (ASWT) embryos as an animal
model system were bioimaged, and in vivo toxicity
was inferred. Moreover, the synthesized C-dots were shown to have
free radical scavenging activity in a dose-dependent manner. The unpassivated
C-dots (CD) were found to sense ferric ions at the micromolar concentration
level. The findings of our study suggest that the multifunctional
potentiality of CDPs serves as high-performance optical nanoprobes
and can be a suitable alternative for various biolabeling and contrasting
agents.

1 Introduction
In
recent days, nanotechnology has extended its nonavoiding potential
influence in the fields of basic science to prototype application.
Basically, nanotechnology deals with materials at the nanoscale level
owing to vast tailoring possibilities, resulting in different composition
size and shape of materials. The nanometer size enables them with
unique properties which can further be modified according to required
applications.1 Luminescent carbon dots
(C-dots) are comparatively new additions to this field, showing enormous
applications in health, energy, and environment. Although it shares
similarities with quantum dots, it has the advantage of being nontoxic
as compared to the heavy-metal-based quantum dots. After its discovery
in 2006, it has gained the massive attention of research groups in
the field of bioanalytics as well as bioimaging due to its efficient
fluorescent property2 and high biocompatibility.3

C-dots are basically carbon nanoparticles
with size below 10 nm.
The prepared C-dots show the chemical composition of nitrogen, hydrogen,
and oxygen and other basic elements with respect to the substrate
of preparation. Synthesis of C-dots is made possible in multiple ways
including arc discharge, laser ablation, electrochemical, hydrothermal,
ultrasonic, microwave, and solvothermal processes. Hydrothermal synthesis
is the best among them, forming high quantum yield C-dots with the
advances in controlling the size, composition, purity, energy and
cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, thus synthesized C-dots can evade
the phase transition from mesophase to substable phase. The basis
of fluorescence property in carbon dots is still unknown. Mechanistically,
the excitation-dependent emission behaviours of C-dots might be due
to the various surface defects caused during the synthesis, leading
to various energy traps. The activation of different surface energy
traps results in different fluorescence properties. More interestingly,
the fluorescence from the C-dots can be quenched efficiently by electron
donor or acceptor molecules in the solution which can make it a good
agent for metal ion sensing. C-dots can be passivated by various functional
groups to cover the carbon core of the C-dots for increasing the quantum
yield (QY), better chemical stability, and maximum aqueous solubility.
C-dots with emission in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region can
also be used in biobased applications of nanobiotechnology. NIR emission
of C-dots is very significant since the body tissues are transparent
in the NIR water window.

The theranostic potential of C-dots
gives the opportunity for biolabeling,
and thereby early diagnosis and management of diseases by loading
therapeutic medicine4 enables a speedy
recovery. C-dots possess better biocompatibility, in vivo stability,
fewer side effects, low cost of production, and control of intellectual
property rights for the successful theranostic implication. One similarity
of most of the carbohydrate-based C-dots is that the diffraction peak
shows amorphous nature between 2θ = 18–24 °C.5−7 C-dots stay in the amorphous stage with lattice spacing closely
resembling graphitic and turbostratic carbon. To synthesize C-dots
various carbon sources were reported like lamp soot,8 food caramels,9 soya milk,10 orange juice,11 eggshell,12 protein (bovine serum albumin),13 and watermelon.14 However, scaling
up the synthesis procedure is still a challenging task.

Curcumin
is the principle compound found in Curcuma longa (commonly
known as turmeric) giving a yellow color to the turmeric.
It can exist in several tautomeric forms including a 1,3-diketo form
and two equivalent enol forms. The enol form is more energetically
stable in the solid form and in solution. Curcumin has antioxidants,
anticancerous, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antifungal activity
along with metal sensing properties. However, poor aqueous solubility
leading to very low bioavailability delimits its efficiency as a potential
agent for application in diverse fields. There are no reports dealing
with the solubility issue of the curcumin despite of its huge potentials
in applications. However, the formation of carbon dot from the curcumin
brings about enhanced aqueous solubility and can cross over the delimiting
factor. The successful synthesis of highly green fluorescent carbon
dots surface passivated with oligoethyleneamine (OEI) resulted in
enhanced biocompatibility and can be used as potential nanoprobes
for biomedical application.15 Herein, we
are reporting for the first time the synthesis of carbon dots from
curcumin and surface passivated with branched PEI (bPEI) giving rise
to increased quantum yield (QY), better chemical stability, and enhanced
aqueous soluble C-dots. These as-synthesized C-dots were used as a
potential biolabeling agent along with antioxidation and metal ion
sensing properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Synthesized CDP and C-Dots
The
color of CDP and CD was brown and pale yellow under visible
light and ocean green and bright blue under UV light, respectively,
as shown in Figure 1A. In UV–vis analysis the CD shows two absorption bands at
265 nm (π–π* transition) and 345 nm (n−π*
transition) as in Figure 1C, whereas CDP portrays two absorption bands at 275 nm (π–π*
transition) and 340 nm (n−π* transition) as demonstrated
in Figure 1D. The absorbance
of CDP increases from the 265 to 275 nm onset of the surface passivation.
The fluorescence spectroscopic study revealed that the maximum fluorescence
emission intensity of CD was due to excitation at 280 nm, and for
CDP it was 340 nm (Figure S1). Since PEI
is a well-known precursor for the carbon dot synthesis as well as
surface passivation agent resulting in high biocompatible excellent
fluorescent carbon dots,16 we underwent
comparative analysis of the fluorescence activity of carbon dots prepared
from the curcumin alone (CD), PEI alone, and PEI passivated curcumin
(CDP) carbon dots. It was observed with the synergistic effect in
the fluorescence behavior of CDP (Figure 2A) with respect to the same of CD (Figure 2C) and PEI alone
(Figure 2D) carbon
dots.

As-synthesized CD and CDP were further dissolved
in water, methanol,
dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to investigate
the effect of the solvent on the fluorescent behavior. In both the
carbon dots, it is found that the water dissolved sample is harvested
with a promising fluorescent yield (Figure 3A and B). This clearly indicates the high
solubility of synthesized C-dots toward universal solvent and does
not hinder the fluorescent activity. Also, in CDP, maximum fluorescence
was observed in DMF. This might be due to the presence of the amide
group on the surface of the carbon dots which was further verified
by FTIR. Furthermore, both carbon dots did not display any significant
reductions in emission intensity onset of excitation by a 150 W Xe
lamp for about 30 min as demonstrated in Figure 3C and Figure 3D. The improved photostability enriches the efficiency
of CDP and C-dots as a potential biological labeling agent. Quantum
yield was measured and represented as in Table S1 by a single-point method and found to be 2.28% and 8.607%
for CDP and CD, respectively. All the fluorescent-based characterizations
showed positive results toward the efficiency of C-dots in susceptible
usage in the biomedical scenario.

2.2 Zeta
Potential and DLS (Hydrodynamic Diameter)
Analysis
Curcumin owns a high negative zeta potential of
−26 mV.17 The zeta potential of
CD was −12 mV as in Figure 4A. This is due to the destruction of some of the functional
groups of curcumin upon the carbon dots synthesis. The positive charge
bearing PEI resulting upon passivation made considerable changes in
the zeta potential of the CDP and turned out to be +3.68 mV (Figure 4B). The amide bond
was formed due to the reaction of the keto group of curcumin and the
amine group of PEI. This resulted in less amino group being present
on the surface of CDP, making the zeta potential less positive as
a cumulative surface charge. The hydrodynamic size of the CD was found
to be 4.190 nm (Figure 4C), and that of CDP was 5.011 nm (Figure. 4D). The increased size of the C-dots upon
passivation ensures that the knowledge of efficient passivation with
PEI was correct and corroborates the zeta potential results as mentioned
above.

2.3 TEM and SAED Analysis
The size and
nature of the phase of carbon dots was examined by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). HRTEM images depict smaller,
near spherical formation of nanoparticles. For CD the average diameter
was found to be 3.28 nm with the perspective of Figure 5A, and for CDP it was 4.45 nm (Figure 5B). The mean size was obtained
by using imageJ2 software analysis. Overtaking proper dilution of
carbon dots, the hydrodynamic diameter was found to be 4.19 nm for
CD and 5.011 nm for CDP by dynamic light-scattering assay. In both
of the cases, the diameter is slightly higher than that measured in
the TEM micrograph. The possible reason for this fluctuation is due
to the aqueous environment present in the DLS assay, while dry samples
were micrographed in HRTEM. Furthermore, SAED patterns of carbon dots
showed diffused rings indicating the amorphous phase of the nanoparticles
(Figure S2) in both CD and CDP. The amorphous
nature of carbon dots18 is indicating the
carbon dots were properly synthesized.

line) CDP.

2.4 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopic
Analysis
The chemical characterization of CD and CDP were
further extended toward the FTIR spectral assay. In the fingerprint
region (1300–400 cm–1) a noticeable change
is observed from carbon dots to curcumin alone. The smoothening of
the curves in Figure 5C (red and black lines) indicates carbonization of curcumin during
hydrothermal treatment. Broadening of 3432 cm–1 peaks
from curcumin to CD and CDP indicates the formation of more −NH2 and −OH groups. Furthermore, the increase of peak
height at 1632 cm–1 signifies the formation of an
amide =C=O bond according to the used synthesis precursors.3

2.5 FE-SEM Analysis (Elemental
Mapping and Elemental
Composition)
Elemental composition was analyzed for CDP by
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) via FESEM (Figure S3). A significant percentage of oxygen
was also found along with the presence of carbon and nitrogen which
is in accord with the low positive zeta potential value of CDP in
spite of the presence of PEI as a passivating agent. Furthermore,
elemental mapping was performed, corroborating the EDS data (Figure S4).

2.6 Ion Sensing
Property
The fluorescent-based
sensors are an interesting research area being studied around the
globe. The metal ion sensing probes are beloved to researchers, among
the many. To critically examine the analytical property of synthesized
CD from curcumin, with the presence of various metal ions, the fluorescence
intensity was observed. The metal ions including Fe3+,
Ag+, and Cu2+ ions caused the reduction in the
fluorescent intensity of CD at the onset of incubation. A change in
the fluorescence intensity of CD (0.1 mg mL–1) due
to the presence of various metal ions (each at a concentration of
60 μM) is depicted in Figure 6A.The nonspecific interaction between these metal ions
and functional groups of CD might be the probable reason for the fluorescence
quenching. Among them Fe3+ exhibits the strongest quenching
efficiency, and this can be exploited for specific Fe3+-based metal sensor application by CD.19,20 The concentration
dependent fluorescence quenching on Fe3+ was further evaluated
and obtained with a steady decline in the fluorescence of CD in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6B). Further, the fluorescence quenching efficiency
of CD was described with the Stern–Volmer plot to extrapolate
a correlation coefficient of 0.9928 (a perfect linear correlation)
in a concentration range of 0–6 μM (Figure 6C). The relative fluorescence
response of CD (F0/F)
was calculated with the following equation  where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of CD in the absence
and presence of Fe3+, and X represents
the concentration of Fe3+. In the above equation Ksv (slope of the linear fit) was calculated
as 11.54 × 104 mol–1 dm–3. Likewise, the detection limit of Fe3+ was calculated
with 3σ/m as 0.62 μM, where σ is
the standard deviation of the blank signal (n = 3)
and m the slope of the linear fit. As per the WHO
report21 the maximum permissible level
of Fe3+ is 5.36 μM in drinking water. Since our synthesized
CD can sense the Fe3+ far below the range as mentioned
above, it can be a possible Fe3+ sensor. This discrimination
outcome for Fe3+ ions resulted from the exceptional coordination
between hydroxyl groups of CD and Fe3+ ions, as compared
to existing reports.22,23

ions. The values are represented as mean ± SEM (n = 3). (B) Fluorescence quenching of CD with the addition of different
concentrations of Fe3+. (C) Relative fluorescence response

2.7 Antioxidant Activity of CDP
A few
existing reports suggest the antioxidant potential of C-dots.24,25 One of the most commonly used ways to conduct the antioxidant activity
study is the DPPH-based assay. DPPH is a free radical with nitrogen.
It is deep purple in color, upon reaction with an antioxidant, and
this deep purple color will eventually change to yellow with respect
to the antioxidant potential (Figure S5). Varying concentrations of CDP were mixed with 50 μM DPPH
in methanol. After incubation with CDP, we found a decrease in absorbance
at 517 nm. As the results were obtained and demonstrated in Figure 6D, the free radical
scavenging ability of CDP was found to increase in a concentration-dependent
manner. As the initial concentration moved to high concentration (from
5 to 50 μg mL–1) increment, there was a considerable
escalation in the scavenging activity from 22 to 56%. The EC50 value
(amount of antioxidant necessary to decrease the concentration of
DPPH by 50%) of CDP was estimated to be 18.2 μg mL–1 from the curve.

2.8 Bacterial Labeling by CDP
Due to
the flexibility of CDPs in their multicolor fluorescence, ultrasmall
size, better photostability, and high biocompatibility, C-dots can
be used as a potential biolabeling agents. On the way to explore its
biolabeling activity, E. coli DH5α and S. aureus bacteria were used as Gram-negative and Gram-positive
model systems. The bacteria were incubated, and a fluorescence micrograph
of labeled bacteria is represented in Figure 7A along with the controls (unlabeled bacteria)
for comparison. The CDP labeled bacteria at different excitation resulted
in blue, green, and light red color fluorescence. A time-dependent
bacterial labeling study was also performed (Figure 7B). The CDP was able to retain their ability
to fluoresce the cells after cellular uptake of 3 h of incubation
and displayed excellent multicolor fluorescence. However, no bactericidal
effects were observed in bacteria labeling with the CDP at the high
concentration of 0.1 mg mL–1. However, the mechanism
of bacterial labeling by carbon dots is still unknown. The possible
fluorescence labeling might be because the different emissive energy
traps26 on the surface of the CDP that
were produced during hydrothermal treatments enhance the fluorescent
emission onset of incubation and excitation.

excitation. (B) Time-dependent fluorescence microscopic images of
CPs labeled DH5α E. coli and S. aureus. Scale bar 100 μM.

2.9 MTT Assay
The biomedical imaging
application of synthesized CDP was first to critically evaluate for
the biocompatibility on both cancer and normal cell lines. In this
regard, mouse embryo fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3) were used as a normal
cell model, whereas human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and human
colorectal adenocarcinoma (HCT-15) were considered as the cancer cell
models. The calculated results were plotted on a graph as shown in Figure 8A. The results thus
obtained had IC50 values of 580, 408, and 413 μg/mL
toward NIH 3T3, A549, and HCT-15 cell lines, respectively. The change
in the IC50 values with respect to the cell lines is a
clear indication of rapid cellular uptake in the case of cancer cells27 correlating its high metabolism and was absent
in the case of a normal cell. Upon treatment with CDP, the gradual
decrement in the cell viability was shown in each stage and cell lines
used. The maximum usable concentration of cell-based bioimaging is
found to be 0.4 μg/mL and hence used for multicolor fluorescent
imaging. The comparative cytotoxicity was determined by presuming
untreated control owing to 100% viability.

of CDP against NIH 3T3, A549, and HCT-15
cells by MTT assay. Two-way ANOVA was carried out by Tukey’s
multiple comparison test for statistical difference between the group
means (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.005,
***p < 0.001, ns-non significant). (B) The multicolor
biolabeling potential of CDP in A549, NIH 3T3, and HCT-15 cell lines
displays DAPI (Blue), GFP (Green), RFP (Red), and merged images (Overlay).
The values are represented as mean ± SEM (n =
3). Scale bar = 100 μm.

2.10 Bioimaging in Cell Lines
The multicolor
biolabeling potential of CDP was explored in A549, NIH 3T3, and HCT-15
cell lines. The bright-field images of CDP-treated cells show intact
morphology after the CDP incubation, which shows no detrimental effect
of CDP on these cells. The onset of excitation of A549 cells shows
excellent blue, green, and less red fluorescence than all other cell
lines (Figure 8B).
The differentiative staining of the cells was highly visible in A549
cells. This may be because the high metabolism and cellular uptake
happen in the cancer cells.26 The NIH 3T3
cell shows less fluorescent imaging potential when compared with the
other two cell lines, and even red fluorescence completely faded.
On the other hand, HCT-15 cells show less fluorescent image in blue
filter, whereas reasonable images were obtained upon treatment. However,
the images showing a ubiquitous distribution of CDP inside the whole
cell and little colocalization of CDP in the nucleus were found without
cell type discrimination.

2.11 Biocompatibility Studies
in Zebrafish
We have conducted zebrafish embryo toxicity
(ZET) tests to introduce
the embryos of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) to evaluate the toxicity28 of CDP on a course of 24 h. After the treatment
of the CDP, the uptake of the CDP occurred through the highly permeable
chorionic membrane in the 4-HPF embryo.29 The toxicity of embryos was get reduced when compared with cell
lines, due to the selective nature of the chorionic membrane. The
survivability of the embryo shown upon treatment with CDP at 0.5 μg/mL
was about 52% as shown in Figure 9A. The initial low concentrations have a nonsignificant
impact on the zebrafish embryo. The embryos started dying upon treatment
after 0.4 μg/mL concentration onward.

concentration of CDP in Zebrafish embryos on a course of 24 h. The
values are represented as mean ± SEM (n = 3).
(B) Bright-field (a) and multicolor fluorescence with blue (b), green
(c), and red (d) images of zebrafish embryos after soaking for 24
h in 0.4 mg/mL concentration of CDP solutions.

2.12 Bioimaging of Zebrafish Embryos
Zebrafish embryos were selected for the organism level of biolabeling
due to ease of execution and developmental understanding. As expected
from bacterial, cell-based biolabeling, the ubiquitous exhibition
of CDP fluorescence was obtained (Figure 9B) simply by soaking 0.4 μg/mL concentration
of CDP (arbitrary concentration used after the results obtained from
cell-based biolabeling). The multicolor fluorescent microscopic images
show the concise uptake of the CDP through the chorionic membrane.
Increased fluorescent at the yolk sac region dictates more accumulation
in the specified area due to the small size and accessibility of CDP
onto the site.30 Likewise, from the results
obtained from cell-based biolabeling, zebrafish embryos also display
higher fluorescence in green then blue and the least in red. The results
are obtained as the excellent display of CDP in fluorescent imaging
which can be exploited as the best alternative for high-cost contrasting
probes.

3 Conclusion
We have
synthesized carbon dots from curcumin as a green source
with the aid of hydrothermal reaction in a one-step, facile manner
(Figure 10). The nonaqueous
soluble curcumin was transformed into a highly hydrophilic carbon
dot after hydrothermal synthesis. Furthermore, the surface passivation
came into effect with PEI, leading to enhanced bioavailability and
fluorescent behaviors. The synthesized carbon dots exhibited excellent
fluorescence intensity (in red, green, blue filters), high photostability,
and efficient multicolor fluorescent emission upon excitation. The
average size of CDP was found to be below 10 nm with near-spherical
shape and was amorphous in nature, which was confirmed with TEM analysis.
Also, the potentiality of CD toward the Fe3+ sensing was
taken into consideration and found to be an efficient Fe3+ ion sensor at the micromolar level. The CPDs were also seen to show
antioxidant activity. The remarkable multicolor fluorescence emission
of CDP services their ability to label bacterial cells with ease.
Optimal labeling time was also found by performing time-dependent
bacterial labeling. The simple, cost-effective, and efficient CDP
was standardized in biolabeling of mammalian cells. The study was
further extended to the animal level using zebrafish embryo as a model
system. The tunable optical behaviors and surface functionalization
of CDP depict potential membership in the optical imaging probe category.
We, therefore, believe that the curcumin-based green synthesized CDP
can effectively overcome the gap between diagnosis and therapy in
cancer and infectious diseases.

CDP in prokaryotes to eukaryotes to organism level. Upon cellular
uptake and excitation, CDP displays excellent multifluorescent properties.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All the chemicals were
of analytical grade and used without any modification. Curcumin, phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), mercury(II) chloride,
lead(II) nitrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cobalt(II) nitrate
hexahydrate, zinc nitrate hexahydrate, ferric chloride anhydrous,
and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were brought from Himedia Laboratories
Pvt. Ltd., India, whereas calcium chloride, copper sulfate, and magnesium
chloride were provided by SRL (Sisco Research Laboratories) Pvt. Ltd.,
India. Cadmium acetate and silver nitrate were received from Merck
Ltd., India. Solvents like hydrochloric acid (HCl) and N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were from Rankem Pvt. Ltd., India. Nickel(II)
acetate tetrahydrate was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Listed
solvents such as methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were received
from SD-Fine Chemicals Limited (SDFCL), India. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) was procured from Amresco, USA. Lastly, quinine sulfate
was purchased from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd., India. Ultrapure water was
used to prepare all the solutions.

4.2 Synthesis
of Carbon Dots
PEI passivated
fluorescent C-dots were synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis
method as elucidated in Figure 1(A). In a typical synthesis, 0.3 g of curcumin was added to
a solution containing 60 mL of water and 20 mL of ethanol. It was
followed by addition of 0.4 g of PEI and stirred vigorously at 80
°C for 30 min. The color of the solution changed from yellow
to red at the onset of PEI addition to curcumin. This solution was
later followed by hydrothermal treatment for 12 h at 200 °C heating
and 15 kg/cm2 g pressure in a nitrogen environment. The
dark brown solution was obtained after the system was cooled down
and followed with filtering with 125 mm filter paper and centrifuged
at 15 000 rpm for 30 min to separate the less fluorogenic,
insoluble deposit from fluorogenic, brown supernatant. The supernatant
containing the surface-passivated C-dots was referred to as CDP. Similarly,
nonpassivated C-dots were synthesized by a similar scheme but without
PEI, and the resulting supernatants were referred to as CD.

4.3 UV–vis Spectroscopy Characterization
of C-Dots
The UV–vis double beam spectrophotometer
(Lasany, LI-2800) was used to find the absorption behavior of the
synthesized C-dots. The scanning range for the samples was set at
200–800 nm with a step size of 0.5 nm. “UV–VIS
Analyst” software equipped with the spectrophotometer was used
to record and analyze data. All the samples were diluted 100 times
for measurements.

4.4 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer
A
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600, Japan) was used to
record the fluorescence spectra of C-dots with a scan speed of 240
nm/min with excitation slit width of 5 nm and emission slit width
of 5 nm. The fluorescence behavior was studied by choosing an excitation
range of 340–500 nm with 20 nm increment. 100-fold dilution
of the samples was used.

4.5 FTIR Spectrophotometer
An FTIR spectrometer
(Thermo Nicolet) was used to study Fourier transform infrared spectra
(FTIR) around the range of 4000–400 cm–1 implementing
the KBr pellet method.

4.6 Zeta Potential
Zeta potential measurements
were done by a Zetasizer nano-ZS90 series (Malvern Instruments Pvt.
Ltd., Germany). A clear disposable zeta cell was used, and 1 mL of
sample was taken in it. Three rounds of measurements each with 15
zeta runs were performed for analysis.

4.7 Field-Emission
Scanning Electron Microscope
(FE-SEM)
For measurement of elementary composition, 15 μL
C-dots were dropped on a properly shaped glass slide and then air-dried.
This was gold sputtered and was subjected to FE-SEM provided with
EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray detector) working at 15–20 keV.
Elemental mapping was also obtained for a different element like carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen.

4.8 Transmission Electron Microscope
(TEM)
The C-dots were properly diluted with water, and 15
μL volume
of the same was dropped onto the nonshining side of the TEM grids
(carbon-coated copper grid). Images of the sample were taken after
proper air drying by TEM (FEI TECHNAI G2) functioning at 120 keV.
The average particle size was calculated after estimating the size
of 40 particles using ImageJ software.

4.9 Photostability
Test
Photostability
of fluorescent carbon dots was tested by a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence
spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon lamp at an emission wavelength
of 446 nm for CDP and 396 nm for CD with a scan time of 1800 s. The
excitation and emission slit width were kept at 5 nm.

4.10 Quantum Yield Measurements
The quantum
yield of the samples was calculated by a single-point scheme by keeping
quinine sulfate as a reference which has a quantum yield of about
0.54 at 360 nm.2 The following equation
was used to calculate the quantum yield.  Here Q = the quantum yield
of the sample; I = the integrated emission intensity
(area under the emission curve); η = refractive index, and A = the optical density.

The subscript R is the reference
fluorophore with a quantum yield which is known. To minimize the reabsorption
effects, absorbance in the 10 mm fluorescence cuvette was kept below
0.1 at the excitation wavelength. The excitation slit width was set
to be 1.0 nm, whereas the emission slit width was 2.5 nm. The parameter
as mentioned above was set to excite the samples and recorded their
fluorescence spectra in the wavelength range of 375–700 nm,
respectively.

4.11 Metal Ion Sensing Evaluation
All
the stock solutions of metal ion were made from their chemical salts.
A final concentration of 60 μM of these metal ions was obtained
by further diluting with deionized water. CD (10 μL, 0.1 mg
mL–1) was added to each of the different metal ion
solutions and homogenized well. This was followed by an incubation
of 15 min at ambient temperature provided. An equal volume of all
the aliquots was transferred to a 96-well black plate in respective
wells, and the fluorescence measurement was performed in the multiplate
reader (Biotek, Cytation 3). Similar steps were followed for Fe3+ ion sensing too. For this assay, 10 μL of CD solution
was mixed with 1 mL of Fe3+ salt solutions in varying concentrations.
The fluorescence spectrum was documented by setting excitation wavelength
at 280 nm.

4.12 Determination of Antioxidant
Activity
2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical
assay with few
modifications was used to measure the antioxidant potential of CDP.
Initially, 0.5 mL of 50 Mm solution of DPPH was prepared in methanol,
and different concentrated samples of CDP were further added. The
total volume of all prepared solutions was maintained at 0.6 mL. The
samples were incubated for 30 min along with appropriate controls
in the dark environment. An amount of 180 μL of the solution
was taken in a microcell quartz cuvette, and change of absorbance
was noted at 517 nm in an UV–vis spectrophotometer. The following
formula was used to calculate the percentage radical scavenging activity
of CD.31  where AD = DPPH absorbance (without CDP) and
AS = the absorbance of the sample solution (with CDP).

4.13 Bacteria Labeling Studies
To study
bacteria labeling property, the Gram-positive S. aureus (MTCC 737) and Gram-negative DH5α E. coli were purchased from IMTECH, India, chosen as model systems. Initially,
the overnight grown culture of both bacterial strains was subcultured
to obtain a secondary grown culture. From this culture, 1 mL was taken
in an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 9000 rpm and then
the pellet was washed twice with autoclaved PBS. Finally the obtained
pellet was resuspended in 100 μL of PBS with 100 μL of
CDP (0.1 mg/mL) and incubated for 3 h. An amount of 5 μL of
the samples was deposited on glass slides and allowed to air-dry for
fluorescence microscope imaging. Similarly, time-dependent bacterial
labeling was performed for optimizing the labeling time.

4.14 Cell Culture
Human lung adenocarcinoma
cells (A549), mouse embryo fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3), and human colorectal
adenocarcinoma (HCT-15) were procured from the National cell line
repository (National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, India). Further,
A549 and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM), whereas HCT-15 grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI-1640) medium was augmented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution. The cells were routinely
maintained in a CO2 incubator provided with 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C in a humidified chamber.

4.15 MTT Assay
Mitochondrial probe mediated
cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay. Toxicity
of treatment with CDP was colorimetrically estimated by the activity
of mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes in actively respiring cells
to convert the aqueous soluble, yellow MTT into an insoluble, purple
formazan as a product. The quantification of purple formazan formation
was done at an absorbance of 570 nm in a microplate reader (Biotek,
Cytation 3). Briefly, the cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture
plates at a seeding density of 0.05 × 106 cells per
well. Overnight incubation was given for the proper attachment, and
later cells underwent incubation with culture media along with varying
concentration of CDP in different wells for 24 h. After the incubation,
the medium was carefully withdrawn from each well and underwent phosphate-buffered
solution (PBS) wash. A fresh medium with 100 μL of 5 mg mL–1 solution of yellow MTT was poured into each well
and kept in the cells for 4 h. The reaction was terminated and followed
the addition of 1 mL of DMSO to solubilize the purple formazan crystals.
Finally, the absorbance at 570 nm of each well was taken for cell
viability calculations. The untreated control (with 100% viability)
is taken as the relative value in the viability calculations. The
viability [mean (%) ± SEM, n = 3] is calculated
in the form of an equation as follows:  

4.16 Bioimaging Studies
The multicolor
imaging of live cells with the use of CDP was explored in A549, NIH
3T3, and HCT-15 cell lines. Primarily, the cells were grown at a density
of 0.3 × 106 in 6 cm well culture dishes and grown
overnight. This was replaced with a fresh medium mixed with 0.4 mg
mL–1 of filter-sterilized CDP (IC50 concentration
obtained after MTT) in the respective wells and incubated for 24 h.
Following PBS wash twice, the CDP fluorescence was bioimaged by an
inverted fluorescent microscope (EVOS FL Color, AMEFC 4300) equipped
with LED light cubes in respective filters. Bright-field images were
taken in transmitted mode, the DAPI filter having an excitation of
360 nm and emission 447 nm, GFP with excitation of 470 nm and emission
of 525 nm, and RFP with an excitation of 530 nm and emission of 593
nm LED light cubes. The overlay images were obtained by superimposing
the images taken from all the filters as mentioned above.

4.17 Zebrafish Biocompatibility and Bioimaging
The full
genome sequenced wild-type (ASWT) strain32 of zebrafish (Danio rerio) was gifted
by Dr. Sridhar Sivasubbu (Developmental Biology and Genomics lab,
CSIR-IGIB, India) and was maintained in aquaneering zebrafish facility
with continuous flow of 4 step sterilized system water with parameter
set as pH at 7.8, conductivity of 710 μs, 28 °C temperature,
dissolved oxygen (>4 ppm), and total gas pressure of 99.9%. The
system
was provided with an alternative 10 h dark and 14 h light cycle. All
the zebrafish-based experimental procedures are conducted by following
OECD guidelines 203. Sexually matured 6-month aged male and female
fish were brought to the breeding tank overnight (1 male:1 female).
The next day, fertilized eggs were microscopically selected by their
transparent nature. The 4 h postfertilized (4HPF) embryos were used
for further studies. A total of 10 embryos were transferred into a
24-well plate provided with the E3 medium. The concentration-dependent
toxicity toward zebrafish embryos was estimated with 10 fish embryos
per well upon treatment with CDP to 24 h. Toxicity was measured as
follows [mean (%) ± SEM, n = 3] comparing with
untreated control (the no. of samples selected in each case is 10).  where C is the constant factor
with respect to no. of embryos per well to make 100. Therefore,  The CDP-treated zebrafish embryos were bioimaged
after a treatment of 24 h. The multicolor fluorescent images were
taken in Leica M205 FA attached with a Leica DFC-7000 T camera along
with pE 300 Cool LED for the light illumination of fluorescent excitation
in DAPI (blue), GFP (green), and RFP (red), whereas bright-field images
were taken directly. All images were captured in the Planapo 1.0X
objective lens.
