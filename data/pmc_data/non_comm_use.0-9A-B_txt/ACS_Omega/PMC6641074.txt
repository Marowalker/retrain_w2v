In the present study,
surface amino-functionalized silica nanofibers
(f-SiO2NFs, average diameter = 400 and
1000 nm) are used as one-dimensional (1-D) fillers of ionic liquid
(IL)-based quasisolid electrolytes. On adding f-SiO2NFs to an IL
(1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, EMITFSA)
containing lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide (LiTFSA), the
well-dispersed 1-D nanofillers easily form a three-dimensional network
structure in the IL, function as physical cross-linkers, and increase
the viscosity of the composites, consequently providing a quasisolid
state at a 3.5 wt % fraction of the NFs. Rheological measurements
demonstrate that the prepared composites exhibit “gel-like”
characteristics at 40–150 °C. All prepared composites
show high ionic conductivities, on the order of 10–3 S cm–1, around room temperature. To investigate
the additive effect of f-SiO2NFs in the
composites, the lithium transference numbers are also evaluated. It
is found that thinner NFs enhance the transference numbers of the
composites. In addition, quasisolid lithium-ion cells containing the
prepared composites demonstrate relatively high rate characteristics
and good cycling performance at high temperature (125 °C).

Introduction
Safe and stable solid-state
electrolytes with high ionic conductivity
have attracted much attention due to their potential applications
in various energy conversion and energy storage devices, including
flexible devices. Ionic liquids (ILs) are one of the potential candidates
as safe and stable electrolyte materials due to their advantages such
as negligible vapor pressure, nonflammability, thermal and chemical
stability, wide electrochemical stability window, and high ionic conductivity.1,2 However, leakage of ILs is an inevitable disadvantage. To address
this issue, quasisolidification (or gelation) and solidification of
ILs are promising strategies. Several researchers have reported quasisolidification
of ILs using organic and inorganic gelators, such as polymers,2,3 supramolecules,4−6 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),7 and inorganic nanoparticles.8−11 Among them, well-dispersed one-dimensional (1-D)
nanofillers easily form a three-dimensional (3-D) network structure
in ILs and function as physical cross-linkers and increase the viscosity
of the composites, consequently providing a stable quasisolid state.
Three-dimensional nanofillers enable the formation of the quasisolid
state of IL composites in smaller amounts than those formed by additive
spherical zero-dimensional nanofillers: the composites with a small
amount of additive fillers can retain liquidlike characteristics,
such as high ionic conductivity. In addition, inorganic fillers provide
composites of high thermal stability: in principle, the composites
are stable at the decomposition temperature of the IL. Fukushima and
Aida first reported IL–inorganic 1-D nanofiller composites,
the well-known “bucky gel”, composed of ILs and CNTs.7 Bucky gels can be utilized in sensors and actuators
but cannot be utilized as electrolytes of energy devices due to their
excellent electronic conductivity of CNTs. To the best of our knowledge,
quasisolid IL composite electrolytes containing insulating inorganic
1-D nanofillers, which can be applied to energy devices such as secondary
batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells, have not been reported.

In the present study, surface-functionalized silica nanofibers
(f-SiO2NFs, average diameter (D) = 400 and 1000 nm) have been used as 1-D fillers of IL-based
quasisolid electrolytes. On adding f-SiO2NFs to an IL (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide,
EMITFSA) containing lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA),
the viscosity of the mixture increases and consequently the composites
are quasisolidified at a 3.5 wt % fraction of the NFs. To investigate
the additive effect of f-SiO2NFs in the
composite electrolytes, the ionic conductivities and lithium transference
numbers are evaluated. In addition, the applicability of the prepared
IL-based quasisolid electrolytes in a conventional composite electrode
is confirmed by using a cointype cell (CR2032) containing a LiFePO4 cathode and Li metal anode.

Experimental Section
Materials
1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide
(EMITFSA, H2O < 30 ppm) was purchased from Kanto Chemical.
Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA, H2O
< 1 ppm) was purchased from Kishida Chemical. These reagents were
used without further purification. Surface amino-functionalized silica
nanofibers (f-SiO2NFs) with average diameters
(D) of 400 and 1000 nm were obtained via electrospinning,
as described previously.12 The density
of the surface amino groups was determined by analysis of pH titration
of zeta potential measurements (around 20 × 10–3 nm–2, Table S1). Prior
to preparing IL–nanofiber composites, the f-SiO2NFs were heated at 120 °C in vacuum for 6 h
to remove residual water.

Preparation of IL–Nanofiber Composite
Electrolytes
IL–nanofiber (IL–NF) composite
electrolytes were
prepared in an argon-filled glovebox. First, the IL (EMITFSA) was
weighed in a vial, and then, a certain amount of LiTFSA was dissolved
under stirring at room temperature to give 0.5, 1.32, and 2.5 M LiTFSA/EMITFSA.
Thereafter, f-SiO2NFs were added stepwise
into the mixture in small portions. On adding f-SiO2NFs, the mixture became more viscous, and solidification (or
gelation) was confirmed when no gravitational flow was observed on
inversion of the vial. The water content of the prepared composite
electrolyte was determined by the Karl Fischer titration method (approximately
500–600 ppm, corresponding to single H2O molecule
per about 60 molecules of EMITFSA). For comparison, surface-unmodified
SiO2NFs and TiO2NFs were prepared13 and used as fillers for the formation of composites.
In addition, ethanol and deionized water were used instead of an IL.

Characterization and Instruments
Thermal properties
of the composite electrolytes in N2 were measured by thermogravimetric-differential
thermal analysis (TG-DTA; Thermo Plus EVO2, Rigaku, Japan). Rheological
measurements were carried out using a rheometer (MCR-301, Anton-Paar,
Austria) with a parallel plate (diameter = 25 mm), at a shear strain
of 1% and a gap of 0.5 mm. Confocal microscope images of the composite
electrolytes were obtained by using a 3-D laser scanning microscope
(VK-9710; KEYENCE, Japan).

Electrochemical Measurements
All
electrochemical measurements
were carried out in an argon-filled glovebox to avoid humidity and
air. The composite electrolyte was sandwiched with a Teflon spacer
between two stainless steel plates (area: 0.28 cm2; thickness:
0.3 mm). The ionic conductivities of the composite electrolytes were
measured by the alternating current (AC) impedance method using a
potentiogalvanostat (SP-150; Bio-logic, France) in the range of 1–100
Hz. The temperature was raised from 5 to 95 °C, and each measurement
was conducted 10 min after the measuring cell attained the operating
temperature.

The lithium transference numbers (t+) of the composite electrolytes were measured by a combination
of direct current (DC) polarization and AC impedance measurements
for Li symmetrical (Li|composite electrolyte|Li) cells at 50 °C.
Chronoamperometry and potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(PEIS) were performed using a potentiogalvanostat (VersaSTAT4; Princeton
Applied Research). PEIS measurements were conducted in the range of
300 kHz to 0.1 Hz, and chronoamperometry measurements were carried
out at 10 mV for ca. 3 h. The values of t+ can be estimated from the following equation14 1  where I is the DC, R is the charge-transfer resistance
between the Li electrode
and electrolyte, and ΔV is the applied voltage
(10 mV). Subscripts 0 and s refer to the initial and steady states,
respectively. The composite electrolyte was sandwiched between two
stainless steel plates, with 0.1 mm thick Li foils as nonblocking
electrodes. The entire process was carried out in an argon-filled
glovebox.

Fabrication and Characterization of Lithium Coin Cells
The LiFePO4 composite cathode was prepared by mixing the
LiFePO4 active material with polyimide (PI) as a binder
and acetylene black (AB) as a conductive additive (LiFePO4/PI/AB = 84:8:8 in weight). The coin cells (CR2032) were assembled
in an argon-filled glovebox by laminating a LiFePO4 composite
cathode (weight density: 1.08 g/cm3; thickness: 23 μm),
a quasisolid IL–NF composite electrolyte (area: 0.95 cm2; thickness: 0.2 mm), and a Li metal anode without a separator.
For comparison, a coin cell was similarly assembled by laminating
a LiFePO4 composite cathode, a polyolefin separator filled
with liquid electrolyte (LiTFSA/EMITFSA), and a Li metal anode. Two
kinds of polyolefin separators, Celgard 2400 (Celgard LLC) and 040A2
(containing silica nanoparticles, Nippon sheet glass, Co. Ltd., Japan)
were used. The charge–discharge measurements were carried out
using an electrochemical analyzer (VMP3; Bio-logic, France) at 2.5–4.0
V and various temperatures, that is, 65, 85, and 125 °C. The
current rate (C rate) is defined as complete
charging and discharging in 1 h for the theoretical capacity of LiFePO4.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of IL–Nanofiber
Composites
By mixing
EMITFSA, LiTFSA, and f-SiO2NFs (no notation
means D = 400 nm), composite electrolytes were prepared.
Hereafter, the prepared composite electrolytes are described as “IL–NF
composite (x M)” (x = molar
concentration of LiTFSA). The formation of the quasisolid (gel) state of the prepared
samples was determined by visual observation on inversion of the vial.
When the prepared samples did not flow gravitationally, we determined
that the quasisolid state was formed. Figure 1a shows a typical photograph of inversion
of a vial for quasisolid composite electrolytes. The quasisolid state
was obtained at a small fraction of fillers, that is, 3.5 wt % of
the NFs. Figure 1c
shows a confocal microscope image of the quasisolid composite electrolyte
observed by 3-D laser scanning microscopy. This image showed that
the f-SiO2NFs were highly dispersed in
the IL and supported the fact that f-SiO2NFs worked as a physical cross-linker. A similar structure is observed
for the quasisolid composite electrolyte containing the thicker f-SiO2NFs (D = 1000 nm) (Figure S1). We can prepare quasisolid state samples
with a small fraction of f-SiO2NF (2–3.5
wt %) but cannot prepare quasisolid state samples at the same fraction
of surface-unmodified SiO2NFs (at least a 10 wt % fraction
of surface-unmodified SiO2NFs was required for quasisolidification).
The mixing of different liquids and NFs was also tested for comparison.
For the mixture of ultrapure water or ethanol as the liquid and f-SiO2NFs as the filler, the fillers precipitated
in the liquid and no solidification occurred (Figure 1b). The difference in the solidification
behavior between the surface-modified and unmodified NFs indicates
that the interaction between the IL and surface functional groups
of the NFs plays a crucial role in solidification at a low fraction
of the NFs. A detailed discussion on the interaction between the IL
and surface amino groups of the NFs is included in the Supporting
Information (please see Figures S2 and S3).

composite electrolyte (IL–NF composite (0.5 M)) and (b) a mixture

composite (0.5 M)).

Rheological Properties
of IL–Nanofiber Composites
To investigate the prepared
solid-state composite electrolytes, the
viscoelastic properties are measured. In general, the quasisolid “gel”
state is defined by viscoelastic properties, as follows: G′-values plateau over a wide range of frequencies and are
also much higher than the G″-values.2,6Figure 2 shows the
viscoelastic properties of the solid-state composite electrolytes
(IL–NF composite (0.5 M)). In Figure 2, the storage modulus (G′) shows constant values higher than the loss modulus (G″) over a wide range of frequencies (0.01–20
Hz) at 40–100 °C. Even at 150
°C, G′ was slightly higher than G″. These results are consistent with those for other
gels reported in the literature15 and support
that the prepared solid-state composite is in the gel state. The viscoelastic
properties of the prepared composites with various compositions are
shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S4–S7). In addition, the complex viscosities of the prepared composite
electrolytes increased with an increase in the additive amount of f-SiO2NFs (Figure S8). These results suggest the following solidification mechanism:
When an IL and f-SiO2NFs are mixed, the f-SiO2NFs are well dispersed due to the interactions
between the IL and surface functional groups. Thereafter, the well-dispersed
NFs form a network structure in the IL. Cross-points in this network
function as physical cross-linkers and increase the viscosity of the
composites. Consequently, when the added amount of f-SiO2NFs reaches a certain value (the gelation point),
the IL-based composites are completely solidified (gelated). In addition, f-SiO2NFs do not impair the thermal stability
of IL-based electrolytes: the composites are stable at the decomposition
temperature of the IL (Figure S9).

properties of the prepared composite electrolytes

temperatures (40, 100, 150, 180, and 200 °C).

Electrical Properties of IL–Nanofiber
Composites
We investigate the ionic conductivities (σ)
of the composite
electrolytes by AC impedance spectroscopy. Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of ionic
conductivity for the composite electrolytes with various compositions.
All of the prepared composite electrolytes show high conductivities
of the order of 10–3 S cm–1 around
room temperature, and the values are almost equivalent to those for
the neat IL (∼8.3 mS cm–1 at 25 °C).16 The ionic conductivity decreases with an increase
in the amount of LiTFSA salt. This should be related to the viscosity
of the LiTFSA-dissolved IL. In general, an IL obeys the Walden rule,
which is the relationship between conductivity and viscosity.17 For instance, a highly viscous IL has a low
ionic conductivity and vice versa. In the present study, the composite
electrolyte containing a high concentration of LiTFSA salt (2.5 M
> 1.32 M > 0.5 M > 0 M) has a low ionic conductivity. In
addition,
the ionic conductivities are little influenced by the fiber diameter
(D = 400 or 1000 nm). This is due to the large apparent
volumetric fraction of IL (above 97%) in the composite electrolyte.

Figure 3 Temperature
dependence of ionic conductivities for IL–NF
composite electrolytes. Legends stand for the concentrations of LiTFSA
(x M) and diameters of f-SiO2NFs (D).

To confirm the additive effect of f-SiO2NFs in an IL, we estimate the lithium transference numbers
(t+). The results of DC polarization and
AC impedance
measurements for the IL–NF composite (0.5 M) at 50 °C
and the t+ estimated by eq 1 are shown in Figure 4 and Table 1, respectively. As seen in Figure 4a, the current drops sharply within a few
minutes and then remains at a constant value. During this combined
measurement, charge-transfer resistances (R0, Rs) do not change drastically (Figure 4b). This supports
the fact that Li metal and IL–NF composites can form stable
interfaces.

IL–NF composite (1.32 M) D = 1000	276	310	34.4	5.9	0.01	
In Table 1, the t+ is improved with a decrease in the diameter
of the f-SiO2NFs from 1000 to 400 nm.
Metal oxide fillers, such as SiO2, TiO2, and Al2O3, are known
as additives that enhance the transport properties of composite polymer
electrolytes.18,19f-SiO2NFs have surface Lewis acid groups (Si–OH groups), which can
interact with the lithium salt anion (TFSA–), and
surface amino groups, which can work as an anion receptor and enhance
the dissociation of LiTFSA. With a decrease in the diameter of the f-SiO2NF, the IL–NF interface increases
and more functional groups can interact with TFSA–. Therefore, a lot of free Li+ would be generated due
to the dissociation of LiTFSA. Our Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
measurements support the following assumption: surface amino groups
of f-SiO2NFs interact with the SO2 group of TFSA– (please see Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information).

IL–Nanofiber Composites for Quasisolid Lithium Batteries
The IL–NF composite electrolytes
(0.5 M) are used for quasisolid lithium batteries. Figure 5 shows typical charge–discharge
voltage profiles of the fabricated cells at a 0.1C rate at 65 °C.
All voltage profiles display a flat plateau at 3.4 V (vs Li/Li+), which is commonly observed for Li/LiFePO4 cells.20−22 Then, the rate performance and cycle performance at higher temperatures
were evaluated to clarify the characteristics of the IL–NF
composites. In the present study, we consider the prepared IL–NF
composite electrolyte with a small fraction of f-SiO2NF as a separator-free quasisolid state electrolyte. Therefore,
we used an IL with a commonly used polyolefin separators (Celgard
2400 is denoted as “2400”, and the separator containing
silica nanoparticles is denoted as “040A2”) as the reference.
The rate performances of the fabricated cells are shown in Figure 6. At 85 °C,
the quasisolid IL–NF composite electrolytes (0.5 M) exhibit
a higher rate performance than that of the liquid electrolytes (0.5
M LiTFSA/EMITFSA) with polyolefin separators. This trend is more conspicuous
at 125 °C, and the cells containing liquid electrolytes with
separators fail after discharge at 1C (Figure 6b). One reason is the difference in their
thermal stabilities. In general, polyolefin separators could not be
used for a long time at high temperature due to their thermal shutdown
capability.23−25 However, IL–NF composite electrolytes containing
1-D inorganic fillers show excellent thermal stability (Figure S9).

composite (0.5 M)|LiFePO4 cell at a 0.1C rate at 65 °C

(a) at 85 °C and (b) at 125 °C. “2400” and
“040A2” stand for the polyolefin separators with and
without inorganic nanoparticles, respectively.

To confirm its applicability in quasisolid lithium batteries,
a
long cycling test of the Li|IL–NF composite|LiFePO4 cell is carried out. We utilize the IL–NF composite with
a high LiTFSA concentration (2.5 M) because electrolytes with a high
Li-salt concentration are commonly utilized for preventing metal corrosion
and/or expanding the electrochemical window, which should contribute
to good cycle stability.26,27Figure 7 shows a long cycle performance at a high
temperature (125 °C). The discharge capacity decreases gradually,
but the cell works constantly for more than 500 cycles. The initial
discharge capacity is ca. 144 mAh g–1, and it becomes
92 mAh g–1 after 500 cycles (64% of the initial
capacity, average Coulombic efficiency = 97.9%). This would be due
to the decomposition of EMITFSA.28 The
EMI cation has a low reduction stability because of the high reactive
hydrogen at the second position. Furthermore, degradation of the LiFePO4 composite cathode used here would also cause the decrease
in capacity. On the other hand, the cell containing the high-concentration
liquid electrolyte (2.5 M LiTFSA/EMITFSA) with the polyolefin separator
(040A2) does not work continuously at 125 °C (Figure 7). Figure 8 shows the cole–cole plot of the cells
during high-temperature cycling. This clearly indicates that the electrochemical reaction at the Li metal/IL−NF composite
interface progresses more smoothly and stable than that at the polyolefin
separator interface during high-temperature cycling.

Figure 8 Cole–cole plot for the charged Li|electrolyte|LiFePO4 cells during high-temperature cycling, as shown in Figure 7. (a) Liquid electrolyte
(040A2) and (b) IL–NF composite (2.5 M).

The rate and cycle performances clearly indicate that the
IL–NF
composite can be applied to high-temperature batteries. We believe
that it is possible to improve the cycling performance by using a
stable IL and cathode material.

Conclusions
We
demonstrated the quasisolidification of an IL using inorganic
1-D nanofillers (surface-functionalized silica nanofibers, f-SiO2NFs), at a 3.5 wt % fraction of the NFs.
These prepared composite electrolytes exhibit typical viscoelastic
properties of gels and a high thermal stability. The ionic conductivities
of the prepared composite electrolytes reach the order of 10–3 S cm–1 around room temperature, and f-SiO2NFs have good effects on the mobility of Li+. The Li|IL–NF composite electrolyte|LiFePO4 cells
demonstrate higher rate properties and a good cycling performance.
These results clearly indicate that IL–NF composites can be
promising electrolytes for use in solid-state energy devices, including
not only lithium batteries but also supercapacitors and dye-sensitized
solar cells.
