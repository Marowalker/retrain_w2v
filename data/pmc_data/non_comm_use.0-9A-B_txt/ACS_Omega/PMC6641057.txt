The
fabrication of “flexible” electronics on plastic
substrates with low melting points requires the development of thin-film
deposition techniques that operate at low temperatures. This is easily
achieved with vacuum- or solution-processed molecular or polymeric
semiconductors, but oxide materials remain a significant challenge.
Here, we show that zinc oxide (ZnO) can be prepared using only room-temperature
processes, with the molecular thin-film precursor zinc phthalocyanine
(ZnPc), followed by UV-light treatment in vacuum to elicit degradation
of the organic components and transformation of the deposited film
to the oxide material. The degradation mechanism was assessed by studying
the influence of the atmosphere during the reaction: it was particularly
sensitive to the oxygen pressure in the chamber and optimal degradation
conditions were established as 3 mbar with 40% oxygen in nitrogen.
The morphology of the film remained relatively unchanged during the
reaction, but a detailed analysis of its composition using both scanning
transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry
revealed that a 40 nm thick layer containing ZnO results from the
100 nm thick precursor after complete reaction. Our methodology represents
a simple route for the fabrication of oxides and multilayer structures
that can be easily integrated into current molecular thin-film growth
setups, without the need for a high-temperature step.

Introduction
The study of transparent functional oxides
has become a topic of
intense research,1 with these materials
being investigated as both electrode materials and active components
in optoelectronic devices. ZnO is one of the most versatile oxides,
as it is a direct wide-band-gap semiconductor (3.35 eV at room temperature),
which has a high exciton binding energy (60 meV), and can be doped
to tune its properties. Several methods for the deposition of ZnO
have been investigated, such as sol–gel,2 molecular beam epitaxy,3 spray
pyrolysis,4 pulsed laser deposition,5 and electrodeposition.6,7 One
important goal of developing novel processing techniques for plastic
electronics is to keep the substrate temperatures low while maintaining
good electrical performance; however, a postannealing step is commonly
necessary to reduce the number of defects and the accumulated strain
energy8 required to achieve a high performance,
even though low-crystallinity ZnO can be achieved at lower temperatures
using solution-based deposition.9 This
reduces the possibilities of using flexible substrates, such as poly(ethylene
terephthalate), for next-generation electronics. Recently, new methods
for postprocessing of oxide precursors deposited from solution have
been used, and room-temperature photochemical treatment has been reported,
although unintentional heating up to 150 °C was still observed.10 Furthermore, deposition of metal oxides at 200
°C on hybrid organic–inorganic bilayers has been achieved
using pulsed laser deposition.11

The search for new methods to obtain transparent conductive oxides
that avoid a high thermal budget is therefore highly topical. A new
method for the transformation of molecular thin films to metal oxides
using UV-light treatment has been proposed by Gardener et al.12 using two well-known molecular semiconductor
materials as precursors, namely, copper and manganese phthalocyanine
(CuPc and MnPc). The method relies on the degradation of the organic
macrocycle of metal phthalocyanines using UV light at a wavelength
of 172 nm (7.2 eV), produced from a Xe2* excimer lamp.13 The energy provided by the UV photons is sufficient
to dissociate the most common organic bonds, such as C–C and
C–N,14 including the bond between
the metallic ion and organic ring of most phthalocyanines, as reported
by Liao et al.15 The Fe, Ni, and Co central
atoms in the phthalocyanines have a higher binding energy than that
provided by the UV light; however, degradation of CoPc films using
UV light (172 nm) has been reported,13 which
indicates that the process is not exclusively photolytic.

In
this work, we explore the possibility of extending the technique
to different systems, such as ZnPc, as a new alternative for low-temperature
formation of ZnO. This technique offers the advantage of operating
completely at room temperature, providing an easy and versatile synthesis
route for the production of transparent conductive semiconductors
on flexible substrates. The technique relies on the growth of molecular
semiconductor thin films and only requires minimal addition to the
existing setups for small-molecule-based devices, offering the prospect
of significantly simplifying the fabrication of organic optoelectronic
devices.

It is crucial to understand the underlying mechanism
of the process
and the factors that affect the degradation of the phthalocyanine
films. Here, we investigate the influence of the presence of oxygen
in the system, as it has proven to be a defining factor in the degradation
of organic molecules,16 mainly due to the
formation of strongly oxidizing species, such as OH radicals17 and excited oxygen species.18,19 A standard mechanism for the full degradation of the organic film
with the formation of ZnO is provided as a result of our tests under
different atmospheric conditions and has been used to characterize
the influence of the morphology of the starting material on the degradation
of the films. We further expand the understanding of the oxide-formation
process by performing elemental analysis on the treated films. Energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy is used to characterize the composition of
the film and to identify the position of the ZnO layer. Secondary
ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is used to quantify the amount of ZnO
produced via a depth profile of the treated film and confirms that
UV treatment is a viable low-temperature route for the formation of
oxide-based materials from molecular semiconductor precursors.

Results
To understand the role of oxygen in the degradation mechanism,
the UV–vis absorption spectra of ZnPc films, with a nominal
thickness of 100 nm, were recorded. Spectra from films before and
after exposure to UV light for 60 min in different environments are
shown in Figure 1a.
The intensities of the characteristic absorption bands can be used
to estimate the amount of the ZnPc film remaining, using the Beer–Lambert
law. Figure 1b shows
the results following integration of the Q-band region (500–800
nm, chosen because it corresponds to a relatively simple electronic
transition and is free from any oxide absorption) to monitor the changes
in the thickness of the molecular film.

Figure 1 (a) Absorption spectra
of a 100 nm ZnPc film before (black) and
after 60 min exposure to UV light in vacuum (blue), and 20% oxygen
partial pressure (green), and at 40% oxygen partial pressure (red).
(b) Calculated residual thickness of film present before and after
exposure to UV light for 60 min in vacuum and at 20 and 40% partial
pressure of oxygen. (c) Estimated thickness of ZnPc films after exposure
to UV light for 60 min shows the relationship between the final thickness
and the total pressure in the reaction chamber. (d) Kinetics of the
photodegradation process. The red line is the linear fitting of the
data range, considering points between 0 and 70 min of exposure.

In vacuum (10–5 mbar), very little degradation
takes place after 60 min (Figures 1a,b). To assess the influence of the presence of oxygen,
the films are exposed to a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, with the
total pressure held at 3 mbar. An oxygen concentration of 20% in the
mixture results in decreased absorption, in the 500–800 nm
range, due to faster degradation of the Pc ring, and a further increment
in the oxygen partial pressure to 40% accelerates this degradation
process (Figure 1a,b).
The results obtained indicate that the presence of oxygen increases
the speed of the reaction; such a behavior was previously observed
for UV exposure of self-assembled monolayers.16 The dependence on oxygen can be due to the formation of strong reactants,
such as OH radicals and excited oxygen molecules, resulting in the
generation of ozone and oxygen radicals in the singlet (O(1D)) and
triplet (O(3P)) states on interaction with UV light, as expressed
in eq 1(17,18) 1  A further increase in oxygen pressure produces
a deceleration of the degradation rate. This is shown by increasing
the total pressure from the vacuum condition in the reaction chamber,
keeping the partial pressure of oxygen at 40%. The equivalent thickness
of ZnPc remaining after treatment for 60 min is shown in Figure 1c. The deceleration
in degradation could be a direct result of the attenuation of UV light
by molecular oxygen (the absorption cross section is 6 × 10–19 cm2 at 172 nm).22 At a partial pressure of oxygen of 0.2 mbar, the attenuation of
UV light before reaching the film is 7%; it is 13% at 1.2 mbar and
rises to 31% at 3 mbar. From these results, we can conclude that a
combination of 1.2 mbar of oxygen with 1.8 mbar of nitrogen (i.e.,
40% partial pressure of oxygen at 3 mbar) is the most effective environment
for the degradation of ZnPc films and will be used as the standard
condition henceforth.

A second parameter influencing the degradation
of the films is
the total photon dose delivered by the UV lamp, which is directly
proportional to the irradiation time for a fixed intensity of light.
The degradation of a series of 100 nm thick ZnPc films as a function
of the irradiation time in the standard atmosphere established earlier
is presented in Figure 1d. The results show a decrease in the absorption intensity for longer
irradiation times. The degradation follows a linear trend until ∼70
min of irradiation, indicating a first-order rate law, with a time
constant of 1.2 nm/min. Following degradation of 95 nm ZnPc at ∼70
min, the degradation slows and a plateau is reached. This could be
due to the higher error in estimating low thicknesses or is more likely
an indication of the formation of a surface layer blocking further
degradation of ZnPc at the substrate interface.

The morphology
of the material was studied by atomic force microscopy
(AFM). The untreated 100 nm thick ZnPc film shown in Figure 2a is uniformly covered with
spherical grains, with diameters of approximately 40 nm, and leading
to a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 6 nm.

Figure 2 AFM images of a 100 nm
thick ZnPc film before and after exposure
to UV light under standard atmospheric conditions. (a) Untreated ZnPc
film and (b) ZnPc film after irradiation for 90 min.

Figure 2b shows
a 100 nm ZnPc film after irradiation with UV light under standard
conditions for 90 min. The RMS roughness of the treated film is 6
nm, the spherical shape of the grains is maintained, and the overall
diameter of the grains increases to approximately 50 nm; however,
smaller grains can also be observed. The conservation of the morphology
in fully degraded Pc films is in agreement with previous work on other
metal Pc’s.13,14

The results of the EDX
analysis of the films in top view (i.e.,
through the different layers of the film and excluding Pt and Cr contributions)
are presented in Table 1.

a The error corresponds to the standard
deviation from multiple measurements.

Although absolute values of composition should be
treated with
caution due to the contribution of the grid, residual oxygen (e.g.,
showing a contribution on the pristine film), and the errors associated
with using the Cliff–Lorimer approach, clear trends can be
identified. The decrease in the C/Zn and N/Zn ratios indicates the
loss of organic material, in agreement with the spectroscopic observations.
Conversely, the relative quantity of O measured after irradiation
increases and the O/Zn ratio more than doubles compared to that for
the fresh film. This is in line with the potential formation of a
layer containing ZnO, although organic fragments are likely to remain.

Insight into the final thickness and composition of the degraded
films can be gathered from cross-sectional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) imaging and SIMS studies. The top left panel in Figure 3a shows an STEM image
of a cross section taken from a ZnPc film after exposure to UV light
for 90 min. This has been acquired using a high-angle annular dark
field (HAADF) detector. When imaging using HAADF STEM, the image intensity
is roughly proportional to the square of the atomic number in the
sample, that is, regions composed of a higher number of Z elements
appear brighter.23 Several regions characteristic
of the film can be identified on the basis of contrast. A low Z and
a homogeneous “film 1” region of thickness 30–40
nm appears directly above the Si substrate. The “film 2”
region contains a mixture of Cr coating (originating from TEM sample
preparation) and low-density material and has a thickness of 20–30
nm.

Figure 3 (a) HAADF image of a cross section of a 100 nm ZnPc film after
exposure to UV light for 90 min under standard atmospheric conditions,
and elemental maps of the constituent elements and coating layers
of the cross section obtained by EDX. (b) Line profile of the full
width of the element maps in (a); inset shows a top-view TEM image
of a treated film, the scale in the inset is 100 nm.

The remaining panels in Figure 3a show quantitative (mass%) EDX maps obtained
from
the treated sample. We have previously shown that this technique is
able to accurately reflect the composition of molecular layers, including
that of complex bilayer structures.21 We
can identify a C-rich layer originating at the Si interface, with
a thickness of 60 nm, which also shows a weak signal from N, suggesting
the possibility of the presence of ZnPc film residues after UV treatment.
Cr and Pt are found on top of the region labeled film 2. The presence
of Cr in film 2 is consistent with its diffusion through the deep
troughs created by irradiation of the film, as seen in AFM (Figure 2b). The O map reveals
that most of the oxygen content is located at the Cr coating and the
SiO2 interface; however, some O can be distinguished at
the interface with film 2, and it is also at this interface that we
find the highest concentration of Zn.

The maps were used to
extract compositional line profiles from
the quantified data, shown in Figure 3b. We observe that 80% of the region labeled film 1
is composed of C, and within the same region, N counts reach 10%.
The film 2 region shows a decrease in both the C and N counts and
an increase in the Zn and O counts, giving a O/Zn ratio of approximately
3. The existence of a Cr signal in this region is attributed to the
diffusion of Cr particles through the less dense areas of the film,
as the film is found to have a number of pinholes, as shown in the
top-view TEM image (inset).

Figure 4 illustrates
a depth profile analysis performed on the ZnPc films before and after
irradiation using SIMS. In the as-deposited film, the C+ and Zn+ signals are stable after an approximate depth
of 5 nm, corresponding to the transient region. The interface with
silicon is identified as the point at which there is a distinct decrease
in the intensity of Zn+, C+, and N+ ions due to collision cascade-induced mixing, resulting in an accumulation
of these ions on encountering the higher-density substrate,24 and this is indicated by a dashed line. As the
thickness of the film has been confirmed to be 100 nm, this gives
a sputter rate of the as-deposited ZnPc of ∼0.47 nm s–1. It is important to note that ZnO fragments are produced following
interaction of ZnPc with the O2+ primary beam
in SIMS, but their intensity is below 10 counts and can be considered
negligible.

film as-deposited. (b) 50 nm ZnO as-deposited. (c) ZnPc film after
90 min of exposure to UV under standard conditions. (d) Ratio of Zn+/ZnO+ in the treated sample (open circles) and
the ZnO+ reference (solid squares). The dashed line indicates
the interface between the film and Si substrate.

As the relative yields of the fragments depend on the precise
parameters
of the SIMS experiments, we use a 50 nm thick ZnO film prepared using
pulsed laser deposition as a reference material25 to be able to quantify the amount of ZnO produced by the
irradiation process. The SIMS profile of the reference film in Figure 4b shows a steady
number of counts of Zn+ and ZnO+, with a negligible
value of C+ counts, as expected.

The SIMS profile
of the ZnPc film subjected to UV treatment for
90 min under standard atmospheric conditions, in Figure 4c, reveals that the C+ signal is approximately 1 order of magnitude lower at the beginning
of the measurement compared to that for the as-deposited film (see Figure 4a). C+ decreases monotonically as a function of depth, indicating the presence
of carbon-rich material on the substrate surface. The Si+ signal is recorded from the start of the measurement, an observation
attributed to the existence of pinholes in the treated sample.

The Zn+ signal intensity is 1 order of magnitude higher
than that for the starting film, with values similar to those observed
in a reference ZnO sample (Figure 4c), suggesting that some of the ZnPc has been transformed
into ZnO. The slightly higher counts as compared to the reference
value can be attributed to a matrix effect generated by the mixture
of the residual film and ZnO and the uncertainty in the sputtering
rate in this complex material. The degree of ZnO formation after UV
treatment of the ZnPc film can therefore be more reliably assessed
by comparing the ratio, R = [Zn+]/[ZnO+], from the reference and treated film, as shown in Figure 4d. The higher ratio
in the UV-treated sample compared to that for ZnO indicates that a
fraction of the Zn+ signal originates from the ZnPc fragments,
in line with the UV–vis results in Figure 1, which showed evidence of residual ZnPc
even after prolonged UV exposure. This fraction can be quantified
using eq 2, in which
the subscripts UV, ref, and ZnPc refer to the ratios obtained in the
degraded sample, the ZnO reference, and the ZnPc film, respectively. 2  Solving for “x”,
the percentage of Zn+ that is generated from the ZnO obtained
is approximately 85–90%.

This result allows us to unambiguously
prove that UV treatment
of ZnPc can lead to the dissociation of the organic ring and promote
the formation of ZnO.

Conclusions
We have developed a
versatile new method for producing ZnO from
a ZnPc precursor at low temperatures using an excimer, UV light, to
promote the degradation of the organic macrocycle. The exposure of
a film of ZnPc with a starting thickness of 100 nm for 90 min to a
mixture of oxygen and nitrogen results in near-complete degradation
of the phthalocyanine film, as can be derived by its transparency
in the visible range. By controlling the partial pressure of oxygen
in the reaction chamber, we were able to show that the efficiency
of degradation is mediated by oxygen but excess oxygen is detrimental
due to significant absorption of the UV light reaching the surface
of the film. Cross-sectional HAADF–TEM imaging shows that the
morphology is inhomogeneous through the thickness of the film, with
the top surface enriched in Zn and O. A more quantitative analysis
is performed using time-of-flight (TOF)-SIMS, which highlights that
a layer containing 85–90% of ZnO is formed, and the remaining
material is composed of residual organic fragments from the degradation
process. Our results offer a route for the creation of metal oxides
entirely at low temperatures, using precursor materials and processes
that are already of widespread use in the field of organic electronics.
This methodology therefore not only represents a significant reduction
of the thermal budget in the fabrication of functional oxide materials
but also opens up unique perspectives, for example, in the creation
of hybrid structures.

Experimental Section
For the preparation
of the substrates, glass, quartz, and Si (100)
were cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol using an ultrasonic
bath for 10 min and then dried with nitrogen and immediately put inside
the evaporation chamber. For TEM imaging in top view,
Nickel (3.05 mm diameter, 150 square mesh grids) and a continuous
carbon film are used (Agar). ZnPc (Aldrich, 97%) thin films were grown
to a nominal thickness of 100 nm at a base pressure of 10–7 mbar using a SPECTROS organic molecular beam deposition chamber
(Kurt J. Lesker). During the deposition process, the substrates were
kept at room temperature and the source Knudsen cell was heated to
a maximum temperature of 420 °C; the deposition rate was 1 Å/s,
monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance.

UV treatment
of the specimens was performed in a purpose-built
vacuum chamber using a UV lamp source from Hereaus (BlueLight compact
172/120 Z), with a nominal irradiance of 50 mW/cm2 and
the sample located at a distance of 7 cm from the UV source, with
the film facing toward the UV lamp during irradiation. To obtain a
controlled atmosphere during treatment, the system pressure was brought
to 10–2 mbar using a rotary pump and filled with
N2 (99.998%) and O2 (99.5%) gases (BOC gases
Ltd) to the stoichiometry and pressure values specified in the text
using a MKS 1179A mass flow controller. For experiments in vacuum,
the chamber was pumped down to 10–5 mbar using a
turbomolecular pump. Following stabilization of the pressure, the
UV lamp was powered on for the desired period of time. The system
pressure was then lowered back to 10–2 mbar for
5 min to remove residual gases and then vented. During
the entire irradiation process the maximum temperature of the substrate
was monitored and maintained below 80 °C, typically at room temperature.
The samples were stored in a desiccator until use.

Electronic
(UV–visible) absorption characterization was
carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 UV/vis spectrophotometer,
with a slit width of 1 mm. AFM measurements were obtained with a Veeco
Dimension 3100 AFM in the tapping mode, using a Si probe from MikroMasch,
with a drive frequency close to 300 kHz. The top-view TEM image and
corresponding EDX in Table 1 were obtained on a JEOL 2010 TEM operated at 200 kV; the
specimen was imaged at 0° tilt and with the objective aperture
inserted. The EDX detector was an Oxford Instruments INCA EDX 80 mm
X-Max detector system. The elemental composition was obtained using
the INCA software, considering the Kα lines from C, N, O, and
Zn and deriving the mass % from theoretical Cliff–Lorimer k-factors. Cross-sections were prepared using an FEI Helios
Nanolab 600 dual-beam instrument, where a scanning electron microscope
is combined with a Ga+ focused ion beam. Final thinning
was performed at 1 keV and 3.2 pA.20,21 To prevent
significant beam-induced damage to surface features, the organic films
were coated with Cr before being exposed to either the electron or
ion beam. Pt was deposited in situ to add further protection. The
EDX composition maps on the cross-sections were obtained on an FEI
Tecnai Osiris STEM, operated at 200 kV with a windowless Super-X SDD
array. Postprocessing was performed using Esprit 1.9 from Bruker.
SIMS analysis was performed on a TOF-SIMS5 by IONTOF. The primary ion beam used was 1 keV O2+ at 170–200 nA over an area of 450 × 450 μm2, and the analytical beam used was 25 keV Bi3,+ with a current of 0.53 pA over an area of 100 × 100 μm2. Both beams have incidence angles of 45°, and the base
pressure of the chamber during the measurements was 1.6 × 10–8 mbar.
