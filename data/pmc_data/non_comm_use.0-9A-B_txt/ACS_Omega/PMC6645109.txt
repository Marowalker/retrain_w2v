Understanding the role of fillers
in the thermal transport of composite
materials is of great importance to engineering better materials.
The filler induces material interfaces within the composite, which
influence the thermal transport between the matrix and themselves.
The filler can also alter the molecular arrangement of the matrix
in its vicinity, which may also impact the thermal transport ability.
In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study
the thermal transport across the matrix–filler interfaces in
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)–organic molecule composites.
Four different organic molecules are studied as the matrixes. They
include hexane (C6H14), hexanamine (C6H13NH2), hexanol (C6H13OH), and hexanoic acid (C5H11COOH), which feature
the same molecular backbone but increasingly different polar functional
groups. The nominal local thermal conductivities of the hexane matrix
with varying distances to the interface are calculated to demonstrate
the influence of the filler on the thermal transport properties of
the matrix. It is found that a more polar matrix exhibits a higher
density in the near-interface region and a higher nominal local thermal
conductivity, suggesting that the interfacial interaction can impact
the local heat transfer ability of the matrix. In addition, the more
polar matrix also leads to a larger interfacial thermal conductance
with h-BN (hexane: 90.47 ± 14.49 MW/m2 K, hexanamine:
113.38 ± 17.72 MW/m2 K, hexanol: 136.16 ± 25.12
MW/m2 K, and hexanoic acid: 155.17 ± 24.89 MW/m2 K) because of the higher matrix density near the interface
and thus more atoms exchanging energy with the filler. The results
of this study may provide useful information for designing composite
materials for heat transfer applications.

Introduction
Thermal transport is critical to a wide
range of applications such
as advanced electronics,1,2 optoelectronics, photovoltaic
solar cells,3 and Li-ion batteries.4 It is also the key to determining the lifetime
and performance of these devices. There has been an increasing demand
for polymeric materials with high thermal conductivity that can dissipate
heat generated by electronic devices in operation. To create efficient
heat transfer pathways, various attempts have been exploited to increase
the thermal conductivity of these materials by compositing high thermal
conductivity fillers, such as carbonaceous materials, boron nitride,
and silicon nitride.5−15 Thus, to facilitate the design of nanocomposites with high thermal
conductivity, a fundamental and comprehensive understanding of the
thermal transport in polymeric nanocomposites is essential.

Though it is universally known that adding high thermal conductivity
materials into a low thermal conductivity matrix can improve the thermal
transport,16,17 the fundamental mechanism that
links the role of fillers to the overall thermal transport in nanocomposites
is still lacking. A typical problem being addressed in nanocomposites
is the thermal transport across the interface between the matrix and
the fillers.18,19 Extensive studies have demonstrated
that the interface plays a critical role in determining the thermal
energy transport in nanocomposites, as the interface can influence
and even dominate the thermal transport in nanocomposites.16,17 Recent studies show that the interfacial thermal resistance could
be decreased by tuning the alignment or surface functionalization
of graphene in composites.18,20 Most of these studies
only address the heat flux exchange across the interface. Beyond the
direct impact on interfacial thermal conductance, the fillers also
affect the nominal local thermal conductivity of the matrix, which
has been studied much less intensively. It has been demonstrated that
the arrangement of matrix molecules close to the interface is influenced
by their dipoles,21,22 resulting in a different density
near the interface.23,24 This may imply that the nominal
local thermal properties of the matrix can also be changed by the
fillers, as the thermal conductivity of polymers is a strong function
of their molecular-level conformations.25,26

In this
work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
analyses to explore the impact of the h-BN fillers on the thermal
transport. As an insulator, h-BN fillers are preferred over graphene,
a semimetal, in many applications (e.g., electronics packaging). The
size dependence of interfacial thermal conductance is first examined
on a single-layer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/hexane (C6H14) system. Then, a series of h-BN interfaces with organic
molecules of different polarization groups as the matrixes are investigated.
These include hexanamine (C6H13NH2), hexanol (C6H13OH), and hexanoic acid (C5H11COOH). We note that our focus of this study
is to understand how different functional groups in organic molecules
influence thermal transport across their interfaces with h-BN. The
selection of the above four materials largely eliminates the impact
of the molecular chain length and backbone on the interfacial thermal
transport, leaving the functional group the only factor that contributes
to the change in interfacial thermal conductance. First, we define
matrix regions based on the distances to the interface and calculate
the nominal local thermal conductivities of these regions. It is interesting
to find that the near-interface region tends to exhibit a higher density,
which leads to a higher nominal local thermal conductivity. Compared
to nonpolar matrix molecules, polar molecules are more strongly attracted
to the BN layer and form a near-interface region of both higher density
and higher nominal local thermal conductivity. Because of the higher
near-interface density, more atoms join the energy exchange across
the interface and lead to a higher interfacial thermal conductance.
These results, although fundamental in nature, may have implications
in the design of materials or nanostructures for different applications.

Simulation
Methods
Here, single-layer h-BN is used as the filler material,
and four
types of organic molecules, hexane (C6H14),
hexanamine (C6H13NH2), hexanol (C6H13OH), and hexanoic acid (C5H11COOH) are studied as matrixes. With similar carbon backbones and
different end groups, the four types of organic molecules should have
similar vibrational spectra,27 but different
polarizations. According to the group electronegativity of the functional
groups in the four matrices (CH3 2.17; NH2 2.39;
OH 2.85; COOH 3.09), the order of their polarity is C5H11COOH > C6H13OH > C6H13NH2 > C6H14 (Figure 1b).28 Thus, the differences in the interfacial thermal conductance
of
these four h-BN–organic molecule systems may be mostly attributed
to polarization.

the chosen region and ΔT/L is the temperature
difference divided by the region length in each region; the smaller
the absolute value of ΔT/L, the larger the
nominal local thermal conductivity.

The Tersoff potential29 is used
to describe
the interaction among the h-BN atoms, and a modified universal force
field30 is used for the nonbonding interaction
between h-BN and organic molecules. All 12-6 Lennard-Jones (L-J) coefficients
associated with the h-BN atoms are listed in Table 1, and the cutoff is set to 10 Å. The
charges of the B and N atoms in h-BN are respectively 1.0 and −1.0,
and the Hockney particle–particle particle–mesh31 method is used here for the evaluation of coulomb
energies and forces. The organic molecules are simulated using the
polymer consistent force field.32 All simulations
are carried out using the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel
simulator.33 A timestep size of 0.25 fs
is used for all simulations.

A typical structure is shown
in Figure 1a. A single
layer of h-BN is centered in
the simulation domain with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in
all three directions. The PBCs in the lateral directions model h-BN
effectively infinite in size without edges. This is reasonable as
the focus here is the interfaces between the basal plane of h-BN and
the organic matrixes, and in reality, such interfaces are dominant
in the composite. Each organic molecular system contains 200 molecules.
The whole system is heated up to 600 K under an NPT (constant number of atoms, pressure, and temperature) ensemble to
achieve a disordered amorphous phase and then cooled down to 300 K
with an annealing speed of 12 K/ps. We note that the PBC in the direction
perpendicular to the h-BN surface is necessary to ensure that the NPT optimization leads to the correct density of the organic
liquid, which is important to the interfacial thermal transport.34,35

Nonequilibrium MD (NEMD) is used to calculate the interfacial
thermal
conductance. After the NPT relaxation at 300 K and
1 atm for 1.5–2 ns, the system is then simulated using an NVE (constant number of atoms, volume, and energy) ensemble
with a heat source (320 K) and sink (280 K) imposed at the two ends
of the system using Langevin thermostats (Figure 1a). A layer of atoms at each end of the simulation
domain is fixed to prevent the heat transfer across the periodic boundaries,
forcing all heat flux to cross the h-BN–organic molecule interface.
The fixed atoms also prevent the translational drift of the whole
system and thus help “lock” the position of the interface
and extract the temperature profile. The relatively large temperature
difference (40 K) is used to establish a measurable temperature gap
across the interface. Except the fixed atoms, the rest of the system,
including the thermostated regions, is simulated in the NVE ensemble for 10 ns for nominal local thermal conductivity and interfacial
thermal conductance calculations at steady state. A typical temperature
profile at the steady state is shown in Figure 1c. The heat flux (q) is
calculated by averaging the energy input and output rates from the
heat source and sink. The temperature jump (ΔT) across the interface is defined by the temperature difference between
the organic molecules at the two sides of the h-BN layer. The interfacial
thermal conductance (G) is then calculated as G = q/ΔT. The nominal
local thermal conductivity (κ) of the matrix is calculated as
κ = q/(ΔT/L), where ΔT is the temperature difference
between the two ends of the chosen region and L is
the length of the chosen region. Figure 1d shows the temperature points used to calculate
ΔT in regions A, B, and C; h-BN/hexane system
is used here as an example. The whole system is divided into several
equal-length bins, and the corresponding temperature is calculated
for each bin. Then, the temperature points selected for each region
are strictly based on the length of each region. The nominal local
thermal conductivity is used to characterize the heat transfer capability
of the region near the interface, which cannot be interpreted as the
thermal conductivity of the organic liquid. We conduct two independent
NEMD simulations for each system, and in each simulation, data at
eight different time intervals (1 ns each) in the steady state are
used for property calculations. Therefore, there are 16 data points
averaged for each value of the interfacial thermal conductance. The
error bars are the standard deviations of these data.

Results and Discussion
The test on the size dependence of interfacial thermal conductance
is first conducted to choose the appropriate system size for later
simulations. The interfacial thermal conductance of systems with 200,
400, and 600 hexane molecules are respectively 88.01 ± 13.77,
104.21 ± 14.49, and 93.62 ± 32.43 MW/m2 K. As
all results are within their error bars, no size dependence is observed,
and thus the system with the size of 200 organic molecules is selected,
so as to save the simulation time but still produce justified calculations.
We note that the thermal conductance for the h-BN/hexane interface
calculated here is larger compared to that of the graphene/polyethylene
interfaces (61 MW/m2 K),34 and
this may be attributed to the stronger L-J interactions and additional
electrostatic interactions across the h-BN/hexane interface.

Next, the nominal local thermal conductivities and densities of
the hexane matrix with varying distances to the interface are calculated,
and the results are shown in Figure 2. Three regions in the hexane matrix are chosen for
exploration. Region A is the region within a distance of 5 Å
next to the interface. Region B is the region within a distance of
10 Å next to the interface. Region C is the whole system, except
for region B, region A, fixed region, heat source, and heat sink.
Further, all the three regions contain only organic molecules. In Figure 2, it is found that
when the hexane matrix gets closer to the h-BN interface, its nominal
local thermal conductivity becomes larger. The higher nominal local
thermal conductivity of the matrix near the interface can be attributed
to the higher density of organic molecules,36 as the corresponding density increases when approaching the interface.

local thermal conductivities and densities of different
regions in the h-BN/hexane system.

Figure 3 shows
the
thermal conductivities and densities of different polar matrixes in
region A, which is also called the near-interface region. According
to the results in Figure 2, the region A shows the highest density and largest nominal
local thermal conductivity. Therefore, the region A is being chosen
for comparison among differently polarized matrixes, so as to offer
the most representative results. It is interesting to find that when
the organic matrix becomes more polarized, the organic molecules in
the near-interface region have larger nominal local thermal conductivity,
which could be explained by the corresponding higher density, as it
is known that a higher density of a liquid can lead to a higher nominal
local thermal conductivity because of the closer intermolecular distance.26

organic molecules
at the near-interface region in the h-BN/hexane, h-BN/hexanamine,
h-BN/hexanol, and h-BN/hexanoic acid systems.

Finally, the thermal transport across the interface is being
explored
via calculating the interfacial thermal conductance of all the matrixes
mentioned above. As Figure 4 shows, when the matrix becomes more polarized, the interfacial
thermal conductance becomes larger. Such an observation is well-correlated
to the increasing trend of the local density of the matrix near the
interface as the molecules become more polar. The more polar organic
molecules are attracted by h-BN closer to the interface because of
the stronger electrostatic interactions. Such a shorter interatomic
distance can significantly enhance the heat flux contributed by the
L-J interaction. In addition, the higher local density near the interface
also allows more organic molecular atoms to have such close “contact”
with the h-BN layer. In other words, it is the collaborative effect
of the electrostatic and L-J interactions that leads to the observed
increase in interfacial thermal conductance as a function of matrix
molecular polarity.

h-BN/hexanol, and h-BN/hexanoic acid as a function of the density
of the organic molecules at the near-interface region.

Conclusions
In summary, we use the
steady-state NEMD method to explore both
the thermal transport across the interface and heat transfer within
the matrix. Four types of organic molecules with different polarities
are studied as the matrixes (hexane (C6H14),
hexanamine (C6H13NH2), hexanol (C6H13OH), and hexanoic acid (C5H11COOH). The nominal local thermal conductivities of the hexane matrix
with varying distances to the interface are calculated to demonstrate
the influence of the fillers on the matrix. It is found that the near-interface
region will form a denser layer and exhibit a higher nominal local
thermal conductivity, and such an effort is more pronounced for a
more polar matrix. The higher density of the near-interface region
in the more polar matrix also leads to a larger interfacial thermal
conductance (hexane: 90.47 ± 14.49 MW/m2 K, hexanamine:
113.38 ± 17.72 MW/m2 K, hexanol: 136.16 ± 25.12
MW/m2 K, and hexanoic acid: 155.17 ± 24.89 MW/m2 K). These conclusions may be generalized to other organic
molecules and polar filler materials. The results of this study may
provide useful information for designing composite materials for heat
transfer applications.
