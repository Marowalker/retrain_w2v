The
recalcitrance exhibited by microbial biofilms to conventional
disinfectants has motivated the development of new chemical strategies
to control and eradicate biofilms. The activities of several small
phenolic compounds and their trichloromethylsulfenyl ester derivatives
were evaluated against planktonic cells and mature biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Some of the phenolic parent compounds
are well-studied constituents of plant essential oils, for example,
eugenol, menthol, carvacrol, and thymol. The potency of sulfenate
ester derivatives was markedly and consistently increased toward both
planktonic cells and biofilms. The mean fold difference between the
parent and derivative minimum inhibitory concentration against planktonic
cells was 44 for S. epidermidis and
16 for P. aeruginosa. The mean fold
difference between the parent and derivative biofilm eradication concentration
for 22 tested compounds against both S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was 3. This work
demonstrates the possibilities of a new class of biofilm-targeting
disinfectants deploying a sulfenate ester functional group to increase
the antimicrobial potency toward microorganisms in biofilms.

1 Introduction
Biofilms
are multicellular communities that form when planktonic
cells adhere to a surface via cell adhesion structures such as pili
or flagella.1,2 The attached cells begin to secrete
extracellular DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides to form an extracellular
polymeric substance (EPS), which traps nutrients while providing protection
from antimicrobials, disinfectants, and host immune defences.3−7 In the biofilm interior, cells experience slow growth rates or become
dormant and are able to persist when other cells in the biofilm are
killed. These persistent cells are able to regenerate the biofilm,
resulting in chronic infection, and contribute greatly to the refractory
characteristics of biofilms.8−12 Reactive antimicrobial agents may be retarded in their penetration
if they are neutralized as they diffuse into the biofilm.13−17 These factors all contribute to increased tolerance toward antibacterial
agents and disinfectants.11,13,18−23 It is traits such as these and biofilms’ prominence in hospitals
that lead to elevated efforts to control biofilms with small molecules.24

Over the last 2 decades, the number of
hospital-acquired infections
has increased by 36% in the US, further stressing the need for novel
disinfectants.25 Routine disinfectants
that are currently used in hospitals include hydrogen peroxide, sodium
hypochlorite, chlorine, and quaternary ammonium salts, although many
of these have serious shortcomings when treating biofilms. For example,
several studies have shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli biofilms exhibit
resistance toward hydrogen peroxide.26−28 Bacterial strains prevalent
in hospitals such as Staphylococcus aureus and P. aeruginosa have also been
shown to exhibit tolerance toward many quaternary ammonium salts such
as benzalkonium chloride, benzyldimethyltetradecylammonium chloride,
and didecyldimethylammonium bromide.29−31 Chlorine and chlorine
dioxide have been shown to have limited potency toward biofilms because
of their inability to fully penetrate through the robust EPS, thus
being unable to reach the inner layers of the biofilm.32,33 Essential oils such as thymol and eugenol are used as environmentally
friendly disinfectants to control S. aureus biofilms, although they are used at high concentrations in order
to be effective.34

Phenols are a
well-studied class of organic compounds which have
been shown to demonstrate varying degrees of antimicrobial activity35−37 and were chosen here because of a wide variety of structurally diverse
phenols being previously evaluated for biological activity.38−46 Among these activities, phenols have been shown to disrupt the cell
membrane causing cell lysis, resulting in cell death.41,45,47,48 Phenols have also been shown to attack cytoplasmic targets by denaturing
proteins and deactivating enzymes, thereby binding to them to form
inoperative complexes.43,46 The majority of phenols selected
for this study were done so for their previously known antimicrobial
activity toward planktonic cells. The essential oils thymol, menthol,
carvacrol, and eugenol were chosen for their inhibitory and antimicrobial
properties against a wide range of taxonomically diverse bacteria.49−52 These essential oils were also chosen because of being found in
several edible herbs.53,54 Halogenated phenols were chosen
because of their extensive evaluation and high activity.40,55 Select alkylphenols were chosen for their antimicrobial and antifouling
activity.56,57 Several alkoxyphenols were selected as a
variety of alkoxy phenols studied for antimicrobial activity.58,59 Two nonphenolic compounds were also chosen for this study, menthol
for its structural similarity to thymol and 5-fluoro-2-((trichloromethyl)thio)isoindoline-1,3-dione
(21b) for its similarity to the fungicide folpet.

The trichloromethylanesulfenimide group that has been employed
here on select phenols is the active antimicrobial pharmacophore in
the broad-spectrum commercial fungicides captan and folpet. captan
and folpet are phthalimide derivatives and are commonly used for protection
of fruit and vegetable crops. Their activity is attributed to their
reactivity with thiols and they are active against a wide range of
fungal diseases.60,61 Significantly, these compounds
have been shown not to possess carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic
threats to humans.62

In this study,
the trichloromethylsulfenate esters of a variety
of phenolic compounds were synthesized and evaluated against both
planktonic cells and biofilms. The bacteria chosen for evaluation
were P. aeruginosa, a Gram-negative
bacterium, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, a Gram-positive bacterium. These bacteria were also selected for
their prevalence in hospitals63−65 as well as their propensity to
form biofilms.66−68 Although the concept of biofilms was presented as
early as the 1960s, the study of behavioral variations in biofilms
such as nutrient uptake, gene expression, and increased tolerance
did not arise until more recently.69−72 Biofilm research is an emerging
field which has been rapidly gaining interest in light of new technologies
in 3D modeling, imaging, antibiofilm strategies, and analytical tools73−75 as well as recent research emphasizing clinical relevance.70,76 These also shed light on the need for novel strategies for the treatment
and eradication of biofilms including antibacterial small natural
molecules, peptides, and lipids.77−82

2 Results and Discussion
In this study, 25
sulfenate esters of small phenols were synthesized.
This synthesis was accomplished by treating each phenol with trichloromethyl
hypochlorothioite in either tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether with
triethylamine at 0 °C for 1.5 h and then allowing the reaction
mixture to stir for 1.5 h at room temperature (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Representative Synthesis, Using Eugenol
(8a)
Sulfenate esters were
more potent than their parent compounds 92
% of the time. For example, on average, trichloromethylsulfenate esters
were nine times more potent than parent compounds against S. epidermidis and 17 times more potent toward P. aeruginosa in planktonic assays (Figure 1). Against biofilms, sulfenate
esters were on average four times more potent toward S. epidermidis and 3.8 times more potent toward P. aeruginosa. It was also observed that toward biofilms,
phenols and sulfenates were less potent compared to planktonic cells,
a phenomenon that has widely been observed in previous studies.3,68,71,83−85 The relative potencies of the precursor phenols and
the corresponding sulfenate esters against both planktonic cells and
biofilms will be discussed in turn.

Figure 1 Parent phenols and corresponding sulfenate
esters and their MICs
and BECs.

2.1 Disinfectant Activities
in the Planktonic
State
2.1.1 Parent Phenols
The most potent
parent phenols against planktonic cells were 4-heptyloxyphenol (7a), 4-chloro-2-methylphenol (16a), 3,4-dichlorophenol
(14a), 2,4-dimethylphenol (3a), 6-(1-methylethyl)-3-methylphenol
(thymol) (1a), and 3-(1-methylethyl)-6-methylphenol (carvacrol)
(4a) against both S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa (Figure 1). Compounds 16a and 14a both possess at least one chlorine group on
the aromatic ring, and although p-fluorophenol (15a) also possesses a halogen on the aromatic ring, it was
significantly less potent against both S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa (Figure 1). This is congruous with previous
studies demonstrating that chlorine, which is more electron-withdrawing
than fluorine, increases the potency of the parent phenols to a greater
extent.40 Compounds 1a, 3a, and 4a all have either isopropyl or methyl
groups in both the ortho and para positions, whereas 7a has a para heptyloxy group (Figure 1). In contrast to 1a, 3a,
and 4a, compound 5a (2,6-diisopropylphenol)
has two isopropyl groups in the ortho positions and possesses a significantly
lower potency. This is likely due to the higher degree of steric hindrance
around the phenolic hydroxyl.

Compound 7a had the
lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) toward both bacteria,
making it of particular interest as it is considerably more active
than the corresponding 4-methoxy and 2,4-dimethoxy derivatives, 9a and 10a (Table 1), which are less lipophilic. In light of this observation,
two additional compounds in this series were synthesized and examined
to evaluate the influence of lipophilicity on activity, these being
4-(benzyloxy)phenol (11a) and 4-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phenol
(12a). Compound 12a was chosen for its near
identical side chain length, when compared to 7a, and
the increased hydrophilicity imparted by the oxygens within the side
chain. Significantly, both of these structural alterations led to
a marked decrease in activity compared to 7a (Table 1). In addition, 24a, which differs from 7a solely by possessing
a sulfur in place of oxygen, was evaluated and was found to be less
potent than 7a against both bacteria.

Table 1 MICs of Phenols 7a, 9a, 10a, 11a, 12a,
and 24a
MICs (mM)	
compounds	S. epidermidis	P. aeruginosa	
7a	0.3	1.5	
9a	15.6	7.8	
10a	15.6	7.8	
11a	15.6	31.2	
12a	12.5	25	
24a	4.5	7.8	
Based on these results, a second SAR study was conducted
with compounds 17a, 19a, and 20a, which all possess
an amide chain in the para position (Table 2). Compounds 17a and 19a were chosen to compare the amide chain length, as 17a has a 4-butanamide group whereas 19a has a 4-heptanamide
group, which is predicted to increase lipophilicity. Compound 20a was chosen for the comparison of nitrogen placement in
the amide side chain vis a vis “amide inversion”. Accordingly,
compound 19a (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) heptanamide)
has the amide nitrogen on the aromatic ring, whereas 20a (N-hexyl-4-hydroxybenzamide) has the carbonyl of
the amide group attached to the aromatic ring. This structural alteration
was performed to assess the effects of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
amide groups of the same length. An additional compound, 18a, was also evaluated for similar reasons to compare to 17a, although here the butanamide group was placed in the 2-position.

Table 2 MICs of Phenols 17a, 18a, 19a, 20a
MICs (mM)	
compounds	S. epidermidis	P. aeruginosa	
17a	6.2	31.2	
18a	12.5	25	
19a	3.8	7.8	
20a	3.8	15.6	
Phenol 19a was the most
potent compound in this series
overall, although 20a shared the same potency against S. epidermidis (Table 2). It was observed that 19a was more potent
than 17a toward both bacteria, continuing the trend seen
earlier that a longer alkyl chain length does increase the potency
toward planktonic cells. Between 17a and 18a, 17a was the more potent isomer against S. epidermidis but not against P.
aeruginosa. This evaluation also suggests that the
length of the alkyl chain has a greater affect than nitrogen placement
with respect to the aromatic ring.

(−)-Menthol (6a) was selected because of its
structural similarities to thymol (1a), and as it is
nonphenolic. Menthol, like thymol, has been studied for its antimicrobial
activity.86,87 It should be noted that 6a was
far less active than 1a toward both bacterial strains
used in this study.

2.1.2 Trichloromethylsulfenate
Esters
It was observed that, in general, more potent parent
phenols produced
more potent sulfenate esters, although this trend could not reliably
be used to predict activity in all cases. The most potent sulfenates
against S. epidermidis were, in descending
order, 1b, 2b, 4b, 3b, and 16b. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent sulfenates were 15b, 2b, 3b followed by 16b. As seen with the
parent phenols, the sulfenate esters 3b and 16b are among the most potent disinfecting agents toward planktonic
cells of both bacteria (Figure 1). Likewise, 1a, 3a, and 4a were also among the most potent toward planktonic S. epidermidis. In contrast, sulfenates 2b and 15b showed a significant potency when their parent
phenols did not. Conversely, phenols 7a and 14a showed exceptional potency toward both bacteria, whereas the corresponding
sulfenates 7b and 14b did not share this
characteristic (Figure 1).

In consonance with the prior SAR study, the series of sulfenate
esters 7b, 9b, 10b, 11b, 12b, and 24b showed a similar trend to
the corresponding phenols toward planktonic cells. Derivatives 7b, 9b, 10b, and 24b shared the highest potency toward S. epidermidis, whereas 7b and 24b were the most potent
toward P. aeruginosa in this series
(Table 3). Sulfenate 11b was least potent toward both bacteria, as was seen with
phenols. It was interesting to note that, in contrast to sulfenates,
the 4-alkoxyphenol 7a was significantly more potent than
its 4-(thioalkyl) counterpart, 24a (Table 1).

Table 3 MICs of
Sulfenates 7b, 9b, 10b, 11b, 12b, and 24b
MICs (mM)	
compounds	S. epidermidis	P. aeruginosa	
7b	0.24	0.49	
9b	0.24	0.7	
10b	0.24	0.95	
11b	1.9	3.8	
12b	0.95	1.9	
24b	0.24	0.49	
In the SAR study involving amides,
a trend consistent with parent
compounds was not observed. Compound 17b was the most
potent sulfenate toward both bacteria, whereas the most potent parents
were 19a and 20a against S. epidermidis and 19a toward P. aeruginosa (Table 4). Similarly, 20b was the least potent
sulfenate in the amide series, whereas the least potent parent was 18a toward S. epidermidis and 17a toward P. aeruginosa. This
further demonstrates that trends in parent compounds cannot necessarily
be used to predict trends in their corresponding sulfenate ester derivatives.

Table 4 MICs of Sulfenates 17b, 18b, 19b, and 20b
MICs (mM)	
compounds	S. epidermidis	P. aeruginosa	
17b	0.49	1.9	
18b	1.9	3.8	
19b	1.9	3.8	
20b	1.9	6.5	
Compounds 6b and 21b were
evaluated separately
against planktonic cells. Compound 6b was among the six
most potent sulfenates against S. epidermidis, sharing an MIC with 3b and 16b (Figure 1). Compound 21b was among the five most potent compounds toward P. aeruginosa, sharing an MIC with 2b, 3b, and 16b.

MICs of sulfenate
esters were, in general, statistically significantly
lower than the MIC of the parent phenols. A two-tailed t-test was performed on four select phenol/sulfenate ester pairs; 3a/b, 10a/b, 13a/b, and 16a/b. Compounds 10a/b and 13a/b were
chosen because of the large discrepancy in potency observed between
the parent phenol and the sulfenate. Compounds 3a/b and 16a/b were chosen because
the potency between parent phenols and sulfenate esters was the least
dramatic of the 25 compound pairs evaluated. The p-value of 2a/b against S.
epidermidis was calculated to be 0.043 and against P. aeruginosa, 0.0028. The p-value
of 10a/b against S. epidermidis is 0.039 and against P. aeruginosa is 0.031. The p-value of 13a/b against S. epidermidis is
0.0039 and against P. aeruginosa was
calculated to be 2.8 × 10–5. The p-values for 16a/b were 0.00051 and 0.0028
against S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, respectively.

2.2 Disinfectant Activity against Biofilms
For comparison,
the antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide and the antibiotics
metronidazole and tobramycin were evaluated for activity toward S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa biofilms. Nitazoxanide is an antidiarrheal commonly used to treat
strains of Cryptosporidium, Blastocystis, and Giardia and is believed to interfere with pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase
enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction.88−90 Nitazoxanide
has also been shown to inhibit biofilm formation in S. epidermidis(91) and enteroaggregative E. coli(92) as well as decrease
the viability of Clostridioides difficile biofilms.93 However, the efficacy of
the drug to eradicate biofilms has yet to be evaluated, as it is here.
The biofilm eradication concentration (BEC) of nitazoxanide was found
to be 50 mM toward S. epidermidis and
3.12 mM toward P. aeruginosa.

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole used to treat a variety of bacterial
and parasitic infections and is most commonly used to treat infections
related to inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Metronidazole
is often used to treat Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and Gram-variable
anaerobic bacteria, as well as protozoans such as Giardia lamblia.94 It has been shown to exhibit lower activity
toward biofilms such as that of Helicobacter pylori(95) and Clostridium difficile(96,97) although it has also been evaluated in tandem with
several other antibiotics, resulting in improved activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Candida
albicans biofilms.98 Against S. epidermidis, the BEC of metronidazole was 6.25
and against P. aeruginosa it was 50
mM.

Tobramycin is an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis,
used
to treat Gram-negative bacteria. Tobramycin is commonly used to treat
bacterial pneumonia and bacterial eye infections, and has been extensively
studied against biofilms.99,100 A study by Høiby
et al. showed that the inhibitory properties toward P. aeruginosa biofilms were lower than that toward
planktonic cells, concluding that biofilms are tolerant to the clinically
recommended dose of the antibiotic.101 Sans-Serramitjana
et al. evaluated the antimicrobial activity of nanoencapsulated tobramycin,
finding that nanoencapsulation did improve the ability of tobramycin
to eradicate P. aeruginosa biofilms
and thus suggesting the strategy of lipid carriers to deliver the
drug, overcoming drug resistance to tobramycin.102 Tobramycin was in part chosen because of the known antimicrobial
resistance of P. aeruginosa, making
it a valuable comparison to this series of novel antimicrobials.103−105 Tobramycin was found to have a BEC of 18 mM toward S. epidermidis and 0.6 mM toward P.
aeruginosa.

2.2.1 Parent Phenols
Based on the observations
from planktonic cell assays, 18 parent phenols and the corresponding
sulfenate esters were chosen for evaluation against biofilms. Compounds 1a, 3a, 7a, and 14a were chosen for their high potency toward planktonic cells (Figure 1). Compounds 2a, 8a, 15a, 10a, 17a, and 22a were selected because of the large
increase in potency between the moderately active parent phenols and
the corresponding sulfenate esters (Figure 1). Compounds 7a, 9a, 10a, 11a, 12a, 24a, 17a, 18a, 19a, and 20a were selected for the purpose of continuing the two SAR
studies conducted with planktonic cells. Compound 25a was chosen as the corresponding sulfenate ester possesses two trichloromethylsulfenate
ester groups. Additionally, the nonphenolic compounds 6a and 21a were chosen, 6a as an aliphatic
alcohol bearing a structural similarity to 1a and 21a for its similarity to the imide corresponding to the commercial
fungicide folpet. Neither compound showed a significant activity toward
either bacterium.

As a continuation of the previous SAR study
involving phenols 7a, 9a, 10a, 11a, 12a, and 24a against
planktonic cells, this series was subsequently evaluated against biofilms
(Table 5). In accordance
with planktonic trends, 7a was the most potent phenol
in this series toward both bacteria.

Phenols 7a, 9a, 10a, 11a, 12a,

12a	31.2	62.5	
24a	6.2	50	
In the
SAR study involving amides, 19a was the most
potent phenol toward both bacteria. In contrast, 18a was
the least potent compound toward both bacteria, whereas in planktonic
assays 17a was least potent toward P.
aeruginosa. In both SAR studies, the more potent phenols
against planktonic cells did in general have lower BECs as well, though
the trend in potency was not always predictable for all compounds
(Table 6).

18a	100	100	
19a	6.2	37	
20a	15.6	50	
Among the additional compounds selected for biofilm
evaluations,
the majority were alkyl phenols, along with two halophenols and hydroquinone
(Table 7). The most
potent phenols toward S. epidermidis biofilms were, in descending order, 14a, 7a, 1a, 19a, and 24a. Against P. aeruginosa, the most potent phenols were 14a, 7a, 1a, 25a, and 2a, whereas here, 14a and 7a shared
the same BEC. Out of these seven compounds, only three (1a, 7a, and 14a) were among the most active
against planktonic cells. These results further reveal that the activity
toward planktonic cells cannot be reliably used to predict the potency
toward biofilms.

2.2.2 Sulfenate Esters
The most potent
sulfenate esters toward S. epidermidis were 7b, 25b, 8b, 9b, and 14b. For P. aeruginosa, the most active sulfenates were 25b, 8b, 19b, 9b, and 1b. Interestingly,
out of these seven compounds, none were among the most potent toward
planktonic cells, which was unexpected as it differs from the trend
observed with parent phenols. However, there were similarities between
most potent phenols and sulfenates toward biofilms. For example, the
phenols corresponding to sulfenates 1b, 7b, 14b, 19b, and 25b were among
the most potent parents.

In consonance with the previous SAR
study involving 4-alkoxyphenols, sulfonates 7b, 9b, 10b, 11b, 12b,
and the 4-(heptylthio)phenyl sulfenate 24b were evaluated
toward biofilms (Table 8). Sulfenate 7b was the most potent compound against
biofilms in this series. Against planktonic cells however, 7b had the same MIC as 9b, 10b, and 24b against S. epidermidis and 24b against P. aeruginosa (Table 3). This observation
supports the finding that long, saturated alkoxy chains generally
increase the potency more so than a diethylene glycol-derived chain
or a benzyl group. It is also noteworthy that the replacement of the
oxygen by sulfur (e.g. 7b → 24b)
results in a substantial decrease in activity.

12b	15.8	31.2	
24b	4.6	25	
The SAR study involving amides
showed that 19b was
the most potent derivative toward both bacteria, which is not congruent
with what was observed with planktonic cells, where 17b was the most active (Table 9). Compound 18b was the least potent sulfenate
in this series against biofilms, whereas 20b was the
least potent toward planktonic cells.

Sulfenates selected for biofilm evaluations,
which were not part
of the two preceding SAR studies, are assembled in Table 10. Among these, monosulfenates 8b and 1b were the most active toward both strains
of bacteria. It is not surprising that bis(sulfenate) 25b showed excellent activity toward biofilms as well. Sulfenate 22b, which contains a basic morpholine group, exhibited a
low potency against both bacterial strains. In this case, it had been
hoped that the presence of a basic amine might increase the permeability
by way of protonation, resulting in enhanced solubility. Nonphenolic
sulfenates 6b and 21b were also evaluated
toward biofilms (Figure 1). Neither compound showed a significant activity, with 6b showing only half the potency of 1b toward S. epidermidis.

2.3 Comparison of Phenols and Sulfenates
Among parents
and sulfenates chosen for the alkoxy and alkylthio
side chains’ SAR study, (7a/b, 9a/b, 10a/b 11a/b, 12a/b, and 24b),
it was shown that the more potent phenols did typically produce more
potent sulfenate esters when evaluated against biofilms. The exception
to this was 12a, which has a lower BEC than 11a, whereas 11b has a lower BEC than 12b against S. epidermidis biofilms. It is therefore evident
that 7a/b were the most potent compounds
in this series overall. In the amide SAR study, between 17a/b and 19a/b, it was observed
that 19a/b was typically more potent than 17a/b with the exception of 19b being
less potent toward planktonic P. aeruginosa. This relationship demonstrates that an increasing alkyl chain length,
as with 7a/b, will in general increase the
potency of phenols and sulfenates. Between the isomers 19a/b and 20a/b, 19a/b were generally the more potent isomers in both planktonic
and biofilm assays, although possessing the same MICs toward S. epidermidis.

Overall, a correlation between
an increased potency toward planktonic cells leading to an increased
potency in biofilms was observed through evaluation of phenols and
corresponding sulfenate esters, with the exception of 14a/b and 7a/b against P. aeruginosa biofilms (Figure 1). This type of relationship has been previously described by others
as well,106 although it has also been observed
that activity toward planktonic cells cannot reliably be used to predict
the same compound potency against biofilms. This has been demonstrated
most recently by Walsh et al. (2019)107 and is further supported here by the foregoing results.

The
BECs of sulfenate esters when compared to their corresponding
parent phenols were generally statistically significantly lower. A
two-tailed t-test was performed on four select phenol/sulfenate
ester pairs; 8a/b, 9a/b, 12a/b, and 17a/b. Compounds 8a/b and 9a/b were chosen because of the large discrepancy in potency
observed between the parent phenol and the sulfenate. Compounds 12a/b and 17a/b were
chosen because the potency between parent phenols and sulfenate esters
was the least dramatic of the 25 compound pairs evaluated. The p-value of 8a/b against S. epidermidis was calculated to be 0.00012 and against P. aeruginosa, 0.044. The p-value
of 9a/b against S. epidermidis is 0.044 and against P. aeruginosa is 0.0091. The p-value of 12a/b against S. epidermidis is
0.0038 and against P. aeruginosa was
calculated to be 0.019. The p-value for 17a/b was 0.019 against both S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa.

2.4 Comparison of Sulfenates and Known Antibacterial
Compounds
The sulfenate esters which showed the highest potency
toward biofilms were 7b toward S. epidermidis, with a BEC of 0.15 mM (Table 8), and 25b toward P. aeruginosa with, a BEC of 3.9 mM (Table 10). Among the commercially available antimicrobials
evaluated here, metronidazole exhibited the highest potency toward S. epidermidis biofilms with a BEC of 6.25 mM and
tobramycin toward P. aeruginosa with
a BEC of 0.6 mM. Against S. epidermidis, nine of 19 sulfenate esters had a lower BEC than metronidazole,
18 out of 19 had a lower BEC than tobramycin, and all 19 had a lower
BEC than nitazoxanide. Against P. aeruginosa, tobramycin and nitazoxanide had a lower BEC than all sulfenate
esters, although all 19 sulfenate esters had a lower BEC than metronidazole.

As Staphylococci and Pseudomonas are both facultative anaerobes and metronidazole
is most affective toward anaerobic bacteria, it was predicted that
the majority of sulfenate esters would be more potent toward both
bacteria. Tobramycin is typically used to treat Gram-negative infections,
and, as shown here, was significantly more potent toward P. aeruginosa than sulfenate esters. Nitazoxanide
is used to treat both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, although
is more often used to treat anaerobes. Sulfenate esters were statistically
more potent toward S. epidermidis than P. aeruginosa; so it is no surprise that the majority
of sulfenates showed greater potency toward S. epidermidis but not toward P. aeruginosa when
compared to known antimicrobials.

2.5 Analysis
of Sulfenate Degradation
Sulfenate esters are expected to
hydrolyze to the parent phenols
in aqueous solutions via cleavage of the S–O bond. In a study
to determine the hydrolytic stability of sulfenates, the decomposition
of (4-fluorophenoxy)trichloromethylsulfane (15b) in water
was monitored via 19F NMR (Figure 2). In this study, the gradual appearance
of 4-fluorophenol (15a) (19F NMR δ:
−125.1 ± 0.1) was clearly revealed.

Figure 2 (A) 19F NMR
of p-fluorophenol (15a) in D2O; (B) 19F NMR of (4-fluorophenoxy)
(trichloromethyl)sulfane (15b) in D2O at 0
h; (C) 19F NMR of (4-fluorophenoxy)(trichloromethyl)sulfane
in D2O after 12 h; (D) 19F NMR of (4-fluorophenoxy)
(trichloromethyl)sulfane in D2O after 24 h; (E) 19F NMR of (4-fluorophenoxy) (trichloromethyl)sulfane in D2O after 48 h; (F) 19F NMR of (4-fluorophenoxy) (trichloromethyl)sulfane
in D2O after 144 h.

After 12 h (C), there were no signs of decomposition of the sulfenate
(15b). However, after 24 h (D), the sulfenate ester (15b) had begun to hydrolyze to the parent phenol. A continuation
of this decomposition was observed (E and F), and after 144 h, the
sulfenate ester approached a 1:1 ratio with the corresponding phenol
(F). This shows that while sulfenate esters do hydrolyze in the presence
of water, they are stable for up to 12 h. This is crucial as the biological
assays employed here require a 12 h exposure time for each phenol
and sulfenate ester derivative in planktonic and biofilm assays. Accordingly,
sulfenates should be robust for the entirety of the exposure time.

3 Conclusions
This study has shown that sulfenate
esters generally exhibit a
significant increase in potency toward planktonic cells and biofilms
of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa when compared to their phenolic counterparts.
For example, it was found that on average sulfenates were nine times
more potent than the parent phenols against S. epidermidis and 17 times more potent toward P. aeruginosa in planktonic assays. Against biofilms, sulfenates were four times
more potent toward both S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa. The findings presented
here also reveal that the most potent compounds toward planktonic
cells are not always the most potent toward biofilms. Likewise, the
most potent parent phenols do not consistently produce the most potent
sulfenate esters. SAR studies have shown that placement, configuration,
and alkyl chain length of functional groups do affect the potency
of the parent phenols as well as the derivatized sulfenates. An additional
study, the monitored hydrolysis of 15b by 19F NMR, has shown that the stability of a representative sulfenate
ester in aqueous solution is approximately 24 h. Further experimentation
to determine clinical significance could be conducted with biofilms’
eradications measurements being determined with biofilms grown on
different surfaces, such as metal and plastic, to mimic those found
in clinical settings.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Synthetic Reagents and Bacteria
All
organic reagents for chemical synthesis were purchased from commercial
sources and used as received without further purification. P. aeruginosa (PA01) and S. epidermidis (35984) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
All bacteria were subcultured onto tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Single colonies were transferred
from the plates and inoculated into 25 mL tryptic soy broth (TSB)
in Erlenmeyer flasks. Cultures were incubated 37 °C for 24 h
and 10 μL of culture was transferred into 25 mL of TSB. The
absorbance was read at 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer,
adjusted to an OD of 0.05 and standardized to 106 to 107 CFU/mL.

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 Preparation of (2,4-Dimethylphenoxy)trichloromethyl
Sulfane (3b)
A 25 mL round-bottomed flask equipped
with a magnetic stirring bar was charged with 2,4-dimethylphenol (610
mg, 5 mmol, 1 equiv) and anhydrous diethyl ether (10 mL). The mixture
was cooled to 0 °C and anhydrous triethylamine (0.77 mL, 5.5
mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added. To the stirred mixture was added trichloromethyl
hypochlorothioite (0.57 mL, 5.25 mmol, 1.05 equiv) dropwise. The reactant
mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1.5 h and allowed to warm to
room temperature and stirred for an additional 12 h. To the resulting
mixture was added pentane (5 mL), which was then filtered through
Celite and washed with t-butyl methyl ether (3 ×
5 mL). The solvents were evaporated in vacuo to provide the title
compound 1.03 g (76%) as a yellow oil. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.23 (dd, J = 843, 2.62 Hz, 1H), 7.00 (dd, J = 2.62,
0.45 Hz, 1H), 6.98 (dd, J = 8.43, 0.45 Hz, 1H), 2.39
(s, 3H), 2.31 (s, 3H). C13NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 16.16 (CH3), 20.55 (CH3), 116.19 (C), 121.49 (CH), 130 (C), 132.02
(C), 133.81 (CH), 136.73 (CH), 156.05 (C). 1H and 13C NMR was used to confirm the purity of all sulfenate esters.

4.3 Efficacy of Phenols and Derivatives on Inhibiting
Planktonic Cells
MICs of all compounds evaluated here were
determined using a 96-well plate assay previously described by Xie.36 Ninety-six-well plates were inoculated with
bacterial culture, prepared as stated in Section 2.1, followed by exposure to the phenol or
the sulfenate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. A
plate reader was used to analyze bacterial inhibition. Samples were
diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and DMSO controls were conducted
as the negative control. Experiments were done in biological triplicate
with technical duplicates. Tests for statistical significance were
calculated with a two-tailed t-test assuming unequal
variances. All compounds were readily soluble in DMSO and no solvent
carriers were used in this procedure.

4.4 Efficacy
of Phenols and Derivatives on Biofilms
In methods similar
to those published by Walsh. et al.,107 both strains were cultured as described above
and biofilms were grown in Costar polystyrene 96-well plates at 37
°C. After 24 h of incubation, the planktonic-phase cells were
gently removed, and the wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Wells were filled with 150 μL dilutions of the
compound being evaluated. The 96-well plates were incubated for an
additional 12 h at 37 °C. The media was gently removed and each
well filled with 150 μL of PBS and the biofilm broken up through
stirring with sterile, wooden rods. Three tenfold dilutions of each
sample were drop-plated on TSA plates and incubated for 24 h. The
BEC was determined to be the lowest concentration at which no bacterial
growth occurred. This procedure was modeled on previously reported
procedures according to Pitts.108 Two negative
controls were conducted with 150 μL of PBS and with 150 μL
of DMSO in the absence of disinfecting agents. Positive disinfectant
controls were conducted using nitazoxanide, metronidazole, and tobramycin.
Experiments were done in biological triplicate with technical duplicates.
All compounds were readily soluble, and no solvent carriers were used
in this procedure.

4.5 Measuring Rate of Hydrolysis
of Sulfenate
Derivatives
(4-Fluorophenoxy)trichloromethylsulfane (15b) (13 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in water (1 mL). An
aliquot was taken every 12 h and dissolved in D2O in an
NMR tube. 19F NMR was performed to measure the appearance
of the parent compound, p-fluorophenol (15a), in the sample. A 0 h 19F NMR of the sulfane derivative
(15b) was taken, as was that of the pure parent compound
(15a) for reference (Figure 2). Technical triplicates were done.
