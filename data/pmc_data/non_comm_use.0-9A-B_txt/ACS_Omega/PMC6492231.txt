Zika
virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that caused widespread panic
beginning in 2015 in northeastern Brazil due to the threatening link
between infection and fetal abnormalities such as microcephaly, spontaneous
abortions, and stillbirths. Since the epidemic began, the virus has
been further investigated, unveiling that the long-term dangers of
ZIKV infection go beyond fetal neurological impairment. Characterization
of the active infection has proven difficult as only 20% of infected
individuals are symptomatic. Additionally, ZIKV is often misdiagnosed
due to serological cross-reactivity with similar flaviviruses such
as dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile. To date, there is no approved
vaccine or therapy against ZIKV, highlighting the urgent need to accurately
identify active infection to help minimize the spread of the virus.
Herein, we describe a highly specific and sensitive enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay to detect early active ZIKV using neutralizing
human monoclonal antibodies isolated from infected patients in Brazil
that do not cross-react with dengue viruses 1–4 and bind directly
to a ZIKV immunodominant epitope. The calculated limits of detection
of active ZIKV fall within the physiological ranges of the virus in
human bodily fluids. This selective immunoassay creates the platform
required for future translation toward a point-of-care assay for ZIKV,
a necessity to diagnose active ZIKV in the remote regions of which
it thrives.

==== Body
Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped single-stranded
ribonucleic acid
(RNA) flavivirus that was first isolated over 70 years ago from rhesus
monkeys in the Zika Forest of Uganda.1 A
detailed investigation was not initially performed on ZIKV, being
that an estimated 80% of cases of infection are asymptomatic, and
those individuals that do present symptoms are often misdiagnosed
as having similar febrile illnesses such as dengue virus (DENV).2 In early 2015, there was a rapid and widespread
infection of ZIKV in Brazil, which was identified due to an over 28-fold
increase in infants born with microcephaly in the region.3 This epidemic resulted in a further investigation
of the dangers of ZIKV infection such as severe neurological impairments
of the infants born to infected mothers and Guillain–Barré
syndrome in infected adults among other health complications.4 The various routes of transmission of the virus,
including spread via Aedes mosquito species, sexual
transmission, and perinatal and blood transfusions, resulted in ZIKV
penetrating the Americas, leading the World Health Organization to
declare ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)
on February 1, 2016.3 Since then, there
has been a large increase in the efforts focused on the characterization
of the virus and its corresponding detection, as symptomatic cases
closely resemble DENV, a mosquito borne viral infection demonstrating
similar initial generic symptoms such as muscle and joint pain, fever,
rash, and conjunctivitis.5 Ongoing research
is also being conducted in the area of vaccine development since there
is no current therapy or vaccine against ZIKV.

The development
of sensitive and selective methods for the detection
of ZIKV is a relatively new field, and because of this, there is no
gold standard for the detection of ZIKV. Accordingly, there are various
assays that have been developed recently that utilize technologies
such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP),
nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, chemiluminescence-based
immunoassays, neutralizing assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISAs).6,7 The nucleic acid-based assays
detect the presence of ZIKV RNA. While these recently developed molecular-based
tests are sensitive and selective, sample preparation of some sort
is traditionally required to extract the viral RNA from the sample
matrix for its corresponding identification. Often times, a purification
step is also employed following viral lysis. Similar to nucleic acid-based
assays, antibody-based assays detect the presence of ZIKV in an indirect
manner by detecting the antibodies generated against ZIKV. Antibody-based
assays specifically detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin
M (IgM), the antibodies produced by the body in response to viral
infection, useful tools for the identification of previous viral infection.8 In contrast to these indirect detection methods,
electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassays detect active ZIKV.9,10 Unfortunately, these systems do not easily lend for further translation
to a point-of-care device due to the aqueous restrictions needed for
the electrodes.11 Lastly, apart from these
currently available assays, plaque reduction neutralizing tests (PRNTs)
are often performed for ZIKV identification. The PRNT assays provide
the most accurate means of detection for ZIKV; however, its protocol
requires several days for obtaining results and, thus, is not practical
and amenable for incorporation into point-of-care platforms. Therefore,
there is a need to monitor active infection by employing other methods
that can be translated into point-of-care detection.

Considering
the drawbacks of the currently available detection
methods, there is still a need for a method capable of detecting an
early and active Zika virus infection. Accordingly, we have developed
a highly selective and sensitive immunoassay for the direct detection
of active ZIKV in human bodily fluids. Assay development was accomplished
by harnessing the unique binding properties of three novel human-neutralizing
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) purified from infected patients in Brazil
that do not cross-react with any of the four dengue virus serotypes
and bind to ZIKV directly for the identification of ZIKV infection
at the earliest time point possible.12 The
implementation of these highly selective novel mAbs to an ELISA provides
direct viral infection detection as compared to currently available
immunoassays that detect the production of IgM and IgG antibodies
in response to ZIKV infection.

Our ELISA-type test is currently
used in a laboratory setting.
However, our test is amenable for translation into a paper-based lateral
flow point-of-care assay, which should be inexpensive, portable, and
meet the WHO-assured requirements. In such tests, the most expensive
reagents are usually the antibodies. Our test uses antibodies prepared
from our own clones, which reduces the cost of their manufacturing.
After corresponding calculations, we estimate that our test would
be approximately $0.25, which is comparable in cost to other lateral
flow point-of-care tests of which the average cost is $0.22.13

In contrast to the existing commercial
assays that use indirect
measures of past or present infection, the test reported herein diagnoses
the active infection of ZIKV using three novel human neutralizing
anti-ZIKV mAbs. The significance of developing such a test for active
ZIKV infection is important when considering the dangerous risks associated
with ZIKV infection of pregnant women, such as abnormal fetal development
or other neurological effects to both the fetus and the mother. The
availability of a test that can be performed during a physician’s
visit would help in diagnosing potential ZIKV infection in a timely
fashion, allowing for therapeutic intervention to be implemented immediately.14 Such a test could also be useful for couples
who are planning a pregnancy and live in locations where Zika infection
is prevalent.

Results and Discussion
There has
been an ongoing need for a reliable, sensitive, simple,
and cost-effective detection method for ZIKV. During the active viremia
cycle, ZIKV can be detected in most human bodily fluids including
urine, serum, whole blood, semen, breast milk, and saliva, two of
which are easily and noninvasively collected from patients of both
sexes: urine and saliva. While semen contains the highest detectable
ZIKV levels for the longest period of time (Table 1), developing a test for semen would inherently
exclude the female population. Likewise, developing a test for breast
milk would exclude the male population. Therefore, we have focused
mostly on human urine, serum, whole blood, and saliva as our possible
sample matrices during the development of our test as to not exclude
either of the sexes.

b Reported in a single case.

Current assays for the detection of ZIKV are either
(1) molecular-based
techniques or (2) immunoassays. While highly sensitive and selective,
molecular-based techniques such as RT-PCR and RT-LAMP are designed
to detect ZIKV RNA to indirectly detect the virus. These methods require
either a sample preparation step or additional incorporation of a
lysis agent to free the RNA from the viral capsid and often times
necessitate a subsequent purification step. The alternative antibody-based
platforms are rapid and simple but subject to the selectivity and
binding characteristics of the antibodies themselves. The appeal of
our work comes from a trio of highly selective antibodies against
ZIKV. These antibodies were expressed and purified from Expi293F human
cell lines, as described in the Methods section,
which were cloned from the cDNA of three patients originally isolated
from three volunteers from São Paulo, Brazil.

It is imperative
to develop a test that accurately detects the
desired virus particle in a patient sample with no cross-reactivity,
ensuring that the test is specific for the desired antigen. To ensure
that the developed immunoassay was specific to only ZIKV and not any
of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4) known
to have homology in their sequence with the ZIKV and thus cross-react
with antibodies against ZIKV, selectivity tests were carried out by
running our immunoassay using either ZIKV, DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, or
DENV4 spiked samples. Specifically, ELISA plates were coated with
capture antibody, followed by incubating spiked samples containing
ZIKV, or one of the DENV serotypes. After the virus samples are captured,
our ZIKV-specific antibodies were added followed by a species-specific
secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In
the final step, a luminol-based chemiluminescent substrate was added,
and the generated signal was measured using a luminescent microtiter
plate reader. The sensitivity was calculated by first measuring the
signal intensity for both ZIKV and DENV, using our assay, and comparing
the percent signal intensity generated for each DENV serotype, at
a viral concentration of 1.3 × 108 copies/mL. The
signals obtained with the DENV 1–4 were compared with those
obtained from ZIKV. The ratio between the DENV 1–4 signal and
that of the ZIKV was found to be ranging between 8.2 and 29.2%, indicating
the high selectivity of the antibody for ZIKV as compared to that
for the DENV 1–4 serotypes (Figure 1).32 These results
demonstrate the highly selective nature of our immunoassay.

Figure 1 Selectivity
studies performed showing that clones P1F12, P1H09,
and P1B04 bind selectively to ZIKV (calculated p <
0.0001). Statistical significance between ZIKV and DENV serotypes
(1–4) was calculated using two-way analysis of variance (GraphPad
Prism Ver. 8.05).

After the identification
of these selective antibodies, P1F12,
P1H09, and P1B04, a sandwich-format colorimetric microtiter plate-based
immunoassay was developed for the detection of ZIKV. The first step
of assay optimization compared a luminol-based chemiluminescent substrate
with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), an absorbance-based
substrate. While the limits of detection (LODs) of each substrate
were comparable, the coefficients of variation (CVs) were found to
be smaller using the TMB-based substrate and thus TMB was selected
for continued assay development. As shown in Figure 2, ZIKV is captured by 4G2 antibodies that
are coated on the surface of the microtiter plate wells. This antibody
has been developed previously and is capable of binding to many flaviviruses
promiscuously.33 Once the ZIKV is captured,
one of three ZIKV-specific antibodies that we identified is able to
also bind to the ZIKV in a highly selective manner, forming the top
half of the ZIKV sandwich. If the virus is present and P1F12, P1H90,
or P1B04 bind, an HRP-conjugated anti-rhesus secondary antibody binds
to the ZIKV-specific primary antibodies. A signal is then produced
as a result of the HRP oxidizing the TMB substrate. This assay for
the acute phase detection of ZIKV was performed using spiked samples
due to the extreme rarity in obtaining patient samples with active
ZIKV. Given that the majority of patients are asymptomatic in the
acute phase and, thus, not aware that they are infected, it is very
difficult to obtain samples from acutely infected patients. Additionally,
these patients who are symptomatic often do not realize that they
have been exposed to ZIKV and the short window of time in which the
active virus is in circulation is often missed. The urgency of detecting
active virus arises when considering the serious negative health consequences
generated when pregnant women are infected with ZIKV during their
first trimester of pregnancy, with each day playing a critical role
in fetal development.34 Additionally, for
future translation of this assay to a point-of-care test, the assay
would be invaluable for its ability to screen a large number of individuals
in low-resource Zika-epidemic areas around the world. This capability
would provide critical data about the ZIKV itself, as well as its
detection windows and methods of spread, which are important considerations
in the epidemiology of infection with potential epidemic consequences.

Figure 2 ZIKV assay
schematic.

A checkerboard assay was employed
to optimize the concentrations
of the primary and secondary antibodies and thus improve the overall
sensitivity. Briefly, on a microtiter plate, the concentrations of
primary and secondary antibodies were varied with respect to each
other and the assay was run normally. Then, for each antibody pair,
the signal-to-noise ratio was calculated by dividing the absorbance
value of the signal when the ZIKV is present (+ control) to the absorbance
value of the signal when the ZIKV is not present (− control).
The results of the checkerboard assay are presented in Figure 3 as a heat map showing the
signal-to-noise ratios from low (green) to high (red). The optimal
concentrations were chosen by selecting the location on the heat map,
where the signal-to-noise ratio was at a maximum. The primary concentrations
chosen for P1F12, P1H09, and P1B04 were 0.5, 1.0, and 0.5 μg/mL,
respectively, and the secondary concentration chosen was 0.125 μg/mL
for all three antibodies.

Figure 3 Checkerboard optimization assay for the antibody
pairs with the x-axis containing the primary antibody
concentrations and
the y-axis the secondary antibody concentrations.
The results are presented as a heat map plot with reported S/N ratios.
Primary antibodies used are (A) P1F12, (B) P1H09, and (C) P1B04. The
secondary antibody used in the assay is a preadsorbed, HRP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG1 heavy chain.

Next, we optimized the best blocking buffer for our assay.
Briefly,
our assay was run using different blocking buffers. The results indicated
that a protein-free blocking buffer had the highest signal-to-noise
ratio. The subsequent optimization steps are summarized in Figure 4: we optimized the
incubation times for the antigen, primary and secondary antibodies,
as well as the incubation time for the substrate for HRP, TMB. We
chose the time points such as to optimize the sensitivity of the assay
while minimizing the overall assay time. For this purpose, we arbitrarily
set as a condition that at least 80% of the maximum signal was observed.
These optimization studies demonstrated that all three primary antibodies
reach 80% of the maximum signal within a 120 min period. Likewise,
the signal for the secondary antibody was within 80% of its maximum
value within 90 min. A 15 min incubation time was sufficient for the
substrate TMB. On the other hand, incubation of the antigen never
reached a plateau during the optimization time period. Therefore,
we selected 120 min as the time for incubation to keep the overall
assay time within a relatively short time frame. It should be noted
that the assay time can be reduced further with little loss of sensitivity
by reducing the incubation times even further. Our total assay time
is approximately 6 h. Current gold-standard RT-PCR methods take a
minimum of 4 h for the PCR portion of the assay. RT-PCR requires sample
preparation, including nucleic acid extraction and purification, which
adds time to the overall time of the assay. We should note that our
assay does not require a sample preparation step and, therefore, is
simpler to run than the RT-PCR. In addition, our assay time could
be cut down to 4 h or less if desired by reducing the incubation time
of the primary antibody at the expense of detection limits, as mentioned.

Figure 4 (A) Antigen
incubation time was optimized to 2 h. (B) Primary antibody
incubation time was optimized for P1F12, P1H09, and P1B04 and a 2
h incubation time period delivered the best results. (C) Incubation
time for the secondary antibody was then optimized with a 1.5 h incubation
time period selected. (D) For the final time point optimization, TMB
was tested with a 15 min incubation time period chosen.

Our assay was then translated from the Zika incubation
buffer to
pooled human bodily fluids, including urine, saliva, serum, and whole
blood. Figure 5 shows
the matrix effect that arose as a result of the incorporation of bodily
fluids, outlining the loss in sensitivity due to the antibodies nonspecifically
binding to proteins inherently present in human bodily fluids. Neat
urine did not demonstrate any significant matrix effect, which increases
its appeal as the matrix of choice for the ZIKV immunoassay since
it is easily collected from both male and female patients and provides
a lengthy 20-day window where ZIKV can be detected. The optimal dilution
for the detection of ZIKV in saliva, serum, and whole blood was found
to be a 1:10 ratio since it does not sacrifice the sensitivity of
the assay while minimizing the matrix effect.

bodily fluids minimizing matrix effect.

Each step of the assay was optimized to determine the conditions
for the assay that yield the lowest LOD of the antigen. Such parameters
included the concentrations of the capture antibody and detection
antibody, the composition of the blocking solution, as well as the
incubation time period for the antigen, capture antibody, detection
antibody, secondary antibody, and TMB. The results of these optimization
studies resulted in the final version of the immunoassay, as explained
in the Materials and Methods part of this manuscript. Using varied concentrations of ZIKV, a
calibration curve was generated. The data were fitted to a nonlinear
sigmoidal dose–response curve (variable slope) using GraphPad
Prism Version 7.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, http://www.graphpad.com). The
LOD and limit of quantitation (LOQ) values were interpolated from
the calibration curves using LOD = SB +
3 × SDB and LOQ = SB +
10 × SDB, where SB and
SDB are the mean and the standard deviation of the blank
measurements, respectively. The coefficients of variations for each
concentration of antigen were calculated by running the assay for
five consecutive days for each of the three primary antibodies. The
assay validation data are summarized in Table 2. Our assay sensitivity is similar in each
of the bodily fluid tested, which means that the detection of the
ZIKV is about an order of magnitude better in urine since we do not
have to dilute urine samples. Our detection limits for each antibody
in each bodily fluid range from (3.73 ± 0.71) × 104 for buffer using P1B04 antibody to (2.05 ± 2.5) × 105 copies of ZIKV/mL for P1F12 antibody in whole blood. When
we compare our limit of detection values with Table 1, we see that our detection limits fall below
the reported ZIKV levels in each of the corresponding bodily fluid.

To determine the accuracy of the assay, we calculated the percent
recovery of the ZIKV by spiking known concentrations of ZIKV and calculating
the interpolated results back to the concentrations. These experiments
were performed on three separate days with three separate plates.
We have calculated the % recovery for three different concentrations
of the ZIKV that fall within the linear range of the assay. The concentrations
were selected so that we can calculate the accuracy of the assay when
the ZIKV levels are close to the detection limit (7.5 × 104 copies ZIKV/mL), fall in the middle of the linear range (4.0
× 105 copies ZIKV/mL), and the final concentration
was selected so it is close to the high end of the linear portion
of the assay (4.0 × 105 copies ZIKV/mL). Our worst
recovery, obtained using diluted saliva and measured using P1F12,
which is the lowest performing antibody of the three, is still approximately
76% of the actual ZIKV concentration, bordering the ±20% clinically
accepted values for percent recovery.35 Out of the 15 different combinations of the 5 human bodily fluids
and three different antibodies, 13 fall within the clinically accepted
values and the remaining two deviate only 1.3 and 4.1%. At the concentrations
where the ZIKV copy numbers are higher, our assay predicted the concentration
very well, around 100%. These results indicate a very high accuracy
for our ZIKV assay.

We have also calculated the precision of
our assay by measuring
the same three different concentrations that were described above
in quadruplicates on three separate days and calculating the CV for
each antibody, at each concentration for each bodily fluid. CV Min,
CV Med, and CV Max correspond to concentrations of 7.5 × 104, 4.0 × 105, and 7.5 × 105 copies ZIKV/mL, respectively. Recovery Min, recovery Med, and recovery
Max also correspond to the same concentrations. Data are an average
of three measurements, performed in triplicates, on three separate
days ± 1 standard deviation. Our results show that in each instance
the CV is less than 10%, indicating high precision for our assay.
Patient samples were unable to be tested due to the extreme difficulty
in obtaining samples. Most patients are asymptomatic and those patients
that do show symptoms usually do not seek care as they confuse them
with common fever, rashes, and/or joint pain, thus demonstrating the
need for a simple and cost-effective test to identify active ZIKV
in human bodily fluids. Correspondingly, a receiver operating characteristic
curve could not be generated.

Conclusions
In this work, we have
described an ELISA for the acute phase detection
of ZIKV with very high specificity. Our assay has been validated in
different bodily fluids such as urine, saliva, serum, and whole blood.
Since the collection of urine and saliva is noninvasive and nongender-specific,
and urine showed no matrix effect, urine is selected as the preferred
sample matrix for this immunoassay. Our assay is very specific and
can distinguish the ZIKV infection from DENV infection in 100% of
the spiked sample experiments performed. The assay is ready for a
large-scale validation using real patient samples collected in dengue-endemic
regions if available. The specificity, accuracy, and the precision
of our assay are high and provide the health care provider an answer
within 6 h of urine collection, demonstrating the first immunoassay-detecting
active ZIKV directly in human urine without the need for sample preparation
or subsequent purification. The development of this assay represents
a vital milestone, as the current translation of this immunoassay
to a point-of-care device by our group is under optimization to provide
global access to ZIKV testing and thus help regulate its spread.

Methods
Identification
of Zika-Specific Antibodies
Patients
Blood and urine samples
were collected from
three volunteers reporting a pruriginous skin rash from São
Paulo, Brazil. A real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay was run
on these samples to confirm the presence of ZIKV RNA. Two of the three
patients reported a previous history of yellow fever immunization
and dengue infection, while the third patient had no history of dengue
or yellow fever vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were obtained from blood samples collected between 8 and 13 days post
onset of symptoms.

Flow Cytometry/Plasmablast Sorting
The frequency of
plasmablasts in circulation was determined by cytometric analysis
of PBMCs obtained from blood collected in acid citrate dextrose using
a Ficoll–Paque gradient. Fresh PBMC samples (1 × 106 cells, room temperature, in the dark) were stained with 100
μL of a cocktail containing the following fluorophore–antibody
conjugates: phycoerythrin (PE)-CF594 anti-human CD3 (clone UCHT1),
PE-CF594 anti-human CD14 (clone MφP9), PE anti-human CD138 (clone
MI15), allophycocyanin (APC)–cyanine (Cy)7 anti-human CD19
(clone SJ25C1), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-human CD38
(clone HB7), APC anti-human CD27 antibody (clone O323), and peridinin
chlorophyll protein complex (PerCP) anti-human CD20 (clone L27). To
discriminate between live and dead cells, we included the fixable
viability dye LIVE/DEAD Fixable Red Dead Cell Stain Kit in the staining
mix. After a 30 min incubation period, the cells were washed twice
with FACS buffer (PBS, 0.5% FBS, 2 mM EDTA). Next, the cells were
resuspended with a PBS 1× solution and stored at 4 °C until
the flow cytometry was performed later the same day using BD FACSAria
II flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo 9. Flow cytometry identified
a population of CD3– CD14– CD19+ CD20– CD38+
CD27+ cells. The same flow cytometry analysis was performed on PBMC
samples (5 × 106 cells). Single plasmablast cells
were sorted into 96-well plates containing a lysis buffer designed
to extract and preserve the RNA (375 mM KCl, 250 mM Tris–HCl
pH 8.3, 15 mM MgCl2, 6.25 mM DTT, 20 U RNAse inhibitor,
250 ng/well yeast tRNA, 0.0625 μL/well IGEPAL CA-630). The RNA
plates were immediately frozen in dry ice after sorting for subsequent
cloning of the Ab chains.

Ab Repertoire Analysis
Reverse transcription
and a
nested PCR were carried out to amplify the variable region of the
Ig chains using established protocols.36 In brief, cDNA was synthesized in a 25 μL reaction using the
original sort plates. Each reaction had 2 μL of 10 mM dNTP,
1 μL of 150 ng random hexamer (IDT), 1 μL of SuperScript
III Reverse Transcriptase, 20 μL of single-sorted cell sample
in lysis buffer, and 1 μL of molecular biology grade water as
described above. The reverse transcription reaction was performed
at 42 °C for 10 min, 25 °C for 10 min, 50 °C for 60
min, and 94 °C for 10 min and the cDNA was stored at −20
°C after completion. Three different nested PCR reactions, light
and heavy chains, were amplified using a HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase
and a mix of 5′ V-specific primers with matching 3′
primers to the constant regions of IgG, immunoglobulin lambda (IgL),
and immunoglobulin kappa (IgK). The second PCR reactions were carried
out with primers redesigned to incorporate restriction sites compatible
with subcloning into rhesus IgG1 expression vectors instead of the
original human vectors.36 We sequenced
the amplified and cloned products using primers complementary to the
Ig constant regions, which were subsequently analyzed using IgBLAST
to identify SHM levels, as well as V(D)J gene rearrangements.37

Expression and Purification of the Antibodies
The mAbs
were expressed in Expi293F human cell lines. Cotransfection of the
plasmids encoding the genes for the antibody’s light and heavy
chains was performed using the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection kit.
The secreted mAb was harvested from the supernatant after 5–6
days and the Ig concentration in the supernatant was determined by
an anti-rhesus IgG ELISA. A protein A column was employed to purify
the antibody and the concentration was determined using the NanoDrop.

Virus Capture Assay and Recombinant E Protein ELISA
Side-by-side
ZIKV virus capture assay (VCA)/recombinant (r)E ELISA
was used to determine antibody binding. Half of the ELISA plate was
coated with the mouse-anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody 4G2 (clone
D1-4G2-4-15) diluted 1:1000 in carbonate binding buffer and half of
the plate was coated with recombinant Zika E protein diluted to 5
μg/mL in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plate
was washed five times with PBS-Tween 20, and the wells were blocked
with 5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The plate was then
washed again and whole virus or rE and PBS were added to corresponding
VCA and rE wells, respectively, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
The mAb samples diluted to 1 μg/mL were added to the washed
plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Following sample addition,
detection was carried out by employing the antibody goat anti-human
IgG ads-HRP (1:10 000 dilution). After a wash step, TMB substrate
was added and incubated at room temperature for 3–4 min. The
reaction was then stopped using TMB stop solution, and the absorbance
was read at 450 nm.

Selectivity
The selectivity of the
assay was performed
against four different strains of dengue viruses (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3,
and DENV4). The wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 100 μL
of 1.0 μg/mL of 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody overnight at 4
°C. Next, 100 μL of different strains of DENV were added
at varying concentrations from 5.5 × 105 to 1.3 ×
108 copies/mL in Zika incubation buffer and incubated overnight
4 °C. After a wash step, 100 μL of the primary Ab was added
at concentrations of 0.5, 0.5, and 0.125 μg/mL for P1F12, P1H09,
and P1B04, respectively, in Zika incubation buffer and incubated at
room temperature for 2 h. Following another wash step, 100 μL
of the secondary Ab was added at a concentration of 0.5, 0.0625, and
0.125 μg/mL for P1F12, P1H09, and P1B04, respectively, in Zika
incubation buffer and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. TMB
(100 μL/well) was added and incubated for 10 min followed by
the addition of a 100 μL aliquot of stop solution to stop the
color development. The absorbance measurement for each well was performed
using a microtiter plate reader at 450 nm.

Optimization of HRP Substrate
The HRP substrate was
optimized using a luminol-based chemiluminescent substrate and TMB,
which is an absorbance-based substrate. For this purpose, the wells
of two 96-well microtiter plates, plate A and plate B, were coated
with 100 μL of 1.0 μg/mL of 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody
overnight at 4 °C. The wells of the plates were washed using
wash buffer, and subsequently an aliquot of 100 μL of ZIKV antigen
was added at a concentration of 1 × 106 copies/mL
in triplicates in Zika incubation buffer for 2 h at room temperature.
Following another wash step, 100 μL of the primary Ab was added
at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 0.5 μg/mL for P1F12, P1H09,
and P1B04, respectively, in Zika incubation buffer and incubated at
room temperature for 2 h. Following another wash step, 100 μL
of the secondary Ab was added at a concentration of 6.25 ng/mL in
Zika incubation buffer and incubated for 1 h, and subsequently the
plates were washed again. To plate A, 100 μL of 1-Step Ultra
TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution was added and incubated for 5 min followed
by the addition of a 100 μL aliquot of stop solution to stop
the color development. The absorbance measurement for each well of
plate A was performed using a microtiter plate reader at 450 nm. Simultaneously,
to plate B, 100 μL of SuperSignal ELISA Femto Substrate Solution
was added and incubated for 5 min. The chemiluminescence measurement
for each well of plate B was performed using a luminescence microtiter
plate reader.

Optimization of Antibody Pairs
Proper
primary and secondary
antibody concentrations were optimized by titrating each antibody
on a microtiter plate (checkerboard assay). For this purpose, the
wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 100 μL of 1.0 μg/mL
of 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody overnight at 4 °C. The wells
of the plate were washed using wash buffer and subsequently blocked
with 200 μL of Starting Block overnight at 4 °C. The washing
step was repeated, and an aliquot of 100 μL of ZIKV antigen
at a concentration of 1 × 106 copies/mL in Zika incubation
buffer was added to odd-numbered wells, and a blank solution was added
to the even-numbered wells and incubated at room temperature for 2
h. Following another wash step, 100 μL/well of the primary Ab,
at varying concentrations from 0.97 ng/mL to 2 μg/mL in Zika
incubation buffer, was added across the rows and incubated at room
temperature for 2 h. Following another wash step, 100 μL/well
of the secondary Ab, at varying concentrations from 78 ng/mL to 10
μg/mL in Zika incubation buffer, was added across the columns
and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plate was washed again,
and 100 μL/well of TMB was added and incubated for 10 min followed
by the addition of a 100 μL aliquot of stop solution to stop
the color development. The absorbance measurement for each well was
performed using a microtiter plate reader at 450 nm.

Optimization
of Blocking Conditions
To determine which
blocking buffer performed best during the blocking step, different
commercially available blocking buffers were tested (Starting Block,
3% BSA, protein-free blocking buffer, Blotto Block, Tween 20, 3% milk,
Super Block, and PBS as negative control). For this purpose, the wells
of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with 100 μL of 1.0
μg/mL of 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody overnight at 4 °C.
The wells of the plate were washed using wash buffer and subsequently
blocked with 200 μL of one of the seven blocking buffers, or
PBS as negative control, overnight at 4 °C. The washing step
was repeated, and an aliquot of 100 μL of ZIKV antigen was added
at a concentration of 1 × 106 copies/mL in triplicates
in Zika incubation buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Following another
wash step, 100 μL of the primary Ab was added at concentrations
of 0.5, 1.0, and 0.5 μg/mL for P1F12, P1H09, and P1B04, respectively,
in Zika incubation buffer and incubated at room temperature for 2
h. Following another wash step, 100 μL of the secondary Ab was
added at a concentration of 6.25 ng/mL in Zika incubation buffer and
incubated for 1 h. The plate was washed again, and 100 μL of
TMB solution was added and incubated for 5 min followed by the addition
of a 100 μL aliquot of stop solution to stop the color development.
The absorbance measurement for each well was performed using a microtiter
plate reader at 450 nm.

Optimization of the Incubation Time for ZIKV
Antigen
The optimum incubation time for the antigen was determined
by coating
the wells of a 96-well plate with 100 μL of 1.0 μg/mL
of 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody overnight at 4 °C. The wells
of the plate were washed using wash buffer and subsequently blocked
with 200 μL of protein-free blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C.
The washing step was repeated, and an aliquot of 100 μL of ZIKV
antigen was added into each well in triplicates at a concentration
of 1 × 106 copies/mL in Zika incubation buffer for
varying time intervals between 15 and 180 min at room temperature.
Following another wash step, an aliquot of 100 μL of the primary
Ab was added at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 0.5 μg/mL for
P1F12, P1H09, and P1B04, respectively, in Zika incubation buffer and
incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Following another wash step,
100 μL of the secondary Ab was added at a concentration of 6.25
ng/mL in Zika incubation buffer and incubated for 1 h. The plate was
washed again, and 100 μL of TMB solution was added and incubated

and incubated for 10 min followed by the addition of a 100 μL
aliquot of stop solution to stop the color development. The absorbance
measurement for each well was performed using a microtiter plate reader
at 450 nm.

Optimization of the Incubation Time for the
Secondary Antibody
The secondary antibody incubation time
was optimized by coating
the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate with 100 μL of 1.0 μg/mL
of 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody overnight at 4 °C. The wells
of the plate were washed using wash buffer and subsequently blocked
with 200 μL of protein-free blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C.
The washing step was repeated, and an aliquot of 100 μL of ZIKV

incubation time optimization was performed for TMB incubation step.
The wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with 100 μL
of 1.0 μg/mL of 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody overnight at 4
°C. The wells of the plate were washed using wash buffer and

min followed by the addition of a 100 μL aliquot of stop solution
to stop the color development. The absorbance measurement for each
well was performed using a microtiter plate reader at 450 nm.

Determination
of the Matrix Effect
ZIKV can be found
in human bodily fluids including urine, blood, serum, plasma, semen,
breast milk, and saliva.23 To test whether
our immunoassay could accurately detect the presence of ZIKV in various
human bodily fluids, we have purchased serum, saliva, urine, and whole
blood from Innovative Research and spiked with various concentrations
of ZIKV. The immunoassay was initially run in urine, saliva, whole
blood, and serum without any dilution of the matrix, as these would
be the ideal conditions in which to detect ZIKV. However, the results
revealed the presence of a matrix effect with the saliva, serum, and
whole blood. The assay was repeated using 5- to 100-fold dilutions
of the saliva, serum, and whole blood in Zika incubation buffer.

Immunoassay Procedure
The immunoassay procedure was
carried out via a sandwich-format colorimetric immunoassay in human
bodily fluids, specifically neat human urine, 10-fold dilutions of
human saliva, whole blood, and human serum in Zika incubation buffer.
For this purpose, the wells of a 96-well, clear bottom, high-binding
polystyrene microtiter plate was coated with 100 μL of 1.0 μg/mL
pan-flaviv 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody in coating buffer overnight
at 4 °C. The wells of the plate were washed using wash buffer
and subsequently blocked with 200 μL/well of protein-free blocking
buffer overnight at 4 °C. The remaining portions of the procedure
were carried out at room temperature. The plate was washed using the
same washing procedure, and 100 μL of ZIKV spiked in various
human bodily fluids at various concentrations was added into the wells
and incubated for 2 h. The plate was washed again, and an aliquot
of 100 μL of the primary antibody in Zika incubation buffer
was added at the following concentrations: 0.5 μg/mL for P1F12,
1.0 μg/mL for P1H09, and 0.125 μg/mL for P1B04 and incubated
for 2 h. The plate was washed again, and 100 μL of HRP-labeled
preadsorbed secondary Ab was added at a concentration of 6.25 ng/mL
for 1.5 h. Following a wash step, 100 μL of TMB solution was
added and incubated for 30 min followed by the addition of a 100 μL
aliquot of stop solution to stop the color development. The absorbance
measurement for each well was performed using a microtiter plate reader
at 450 nm.

Assay Validation
Precision
Evaluation
of the precision of the assay
was performed by repeating the experiment every day for 5 days for
each of the three antibodies. The data from these experiments were
collected and analyzed to obtain the coefficients of variation for
each concentration of antigen.

Accuracy
The accuracy
of the immunoassay was evaluated
via a spike recovery test, which was repeated in separate assays spread
over 5 days. To perform the spike recovery test, the wells of a 96-well
microtiter plate were coated with 100 μL of 1.0 μg/mL
of 4G2 anti-mouse IgG2a antibody overnight at 4 °C. The wells
of the plate were washed using wash buffer and subsequently blocked
with 200 μL of protein-free blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C.
The washing step was repeated, and an aliquot of 100 μL of ZIKV
antigen was added at varying concentrations from 5.0 × 104 to 1.0 × 106 copies/mL in Zika incubation
buffer, neat urine, 10-fold diluted saliva, serum, and whole blood.
These concentrations were used to generate the calibration curve for
the immunoassay in their corresponding matrix. On the same plates,
100 μL of ZIKV antigen was added at concentrations that correspond
to low, medium, and high levels of the analyte (7.5 × 104, 4.0 × 105, and 7.5 × 105 copies/mL) in the same matrix as the calibration curve. The plate
was then incubated for 2 h. After the incubation was complete, the
plate was washed and 100 μL aliquots of the primary Ab were
added at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 0.125 μg/mL for P1F12,
P1H09, and P1B04, respectively, in Zika incubation buffer and incubated
at room temperature for 2 h. Following another wash step, 100 μL
of the secondary Ab was added at a concentration of 6.25 ng/mL in
Zika incubation buffer and incubated at room temperature for 90 min.
The plate was washed again, and 100 μL of TMB solution was added
and incubated for 30 min followed by the addition of a 100 μL
aliquot of stop solution to stop the color development. The absorbance
measurement for each well was performed using a microtiter plate reader
at 450 nm. The calibration curve was generated, and the signals corresponding
to low, medium, and high concentrations of the ZIKV were interpolated
to calculate the predicted concentrations. The percent recovery was
calculated as an assay parameter for accuracy.

Safety
As the ZIKV used to carry out the experiments
detailed here was inactivated via irradiation, no unforeseen safety
hazards were presented. For the DENV selectivity studies, biosafety
level II precautions were employed, and no unanticipated safety hazards
were encountered. For future testing of patient samples with active
ZIKV and/or DENV, if encountered, appropriate safety proceedings for
biosafety level II must be followed.
