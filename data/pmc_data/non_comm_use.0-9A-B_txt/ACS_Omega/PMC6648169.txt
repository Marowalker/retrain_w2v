2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D),
a phenoxyalkanoic acid
herbicide, is among the most widely distributed pollutants in the
environment. 2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), as the main metabolite
of 2,4-D, always accompanies 2,4-D. In this paper, we did research
on the combined toxicities of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP to Vibrio qinghaiensis sp.-Q67 (Q67) and Caenorhabditis elegans. It was found that the toxicity
of 2,4-DCP is more severe than that of its parent 2,4-D at any concentration
levels whether to Q67 or to C. elegans. Furthermore, 2,4-DCP
to Q67 has the time-dependent toxicity. The toxicity of the mixture
of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP to Q67 is increasing with the exposure time,
but that to C. elegans does not change
over time. There is a good linear relationship between the pEC50/pLC50 value of binary mixture ray of 2,4-D and
2,4-DCP and the mixture ratio of 2,4-DCP, which implies the predictability
of mixture toxicity of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP. The toxicological interactions
of the binary mixtures to Q67 are basically additive actions whether
at 0.25 or at 12 h. However, most mixtures have antagonistic interactions
against C. elegans.

==== Body
Introduction
2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic
acid (2,4-D), a phenoxyalkanoic acid
herbicide, was first synthesized in 1941 and commercially marketed
in the United States in 1944.1 2,4-D has
been widely used for controlling many types of broad leaf weeds, grasses,
and other monocots.2 2,4-D is often detected
in water, soil, and air. Recent study has shown that 2,4-D was the
most frequently detected herbicide in the suburban surface waters
in the United States during 1999–2010, with the highest concentration
of 0.46 μg/L.3 It was reported that
the concentrations of 2,4-D in soil were 1.8 and 4.6 ng/g at the 95th
percentiles for North Carolina and Ohio State of United States, respectively.4 In the 95th percentiles for North Carolina, the
air concentration of 2,4-D was up to 1.7 ng/m.3,4 Numerous
studies have proven that 2,4-D may be an environmental hazard.5,6 It can reduce growth rates, induce reproductive problems, or could
cause death of nontarget species including plants and animals.7−9

2,4-D is moderately persistent in the environment and the
half-life
of it is about 15–312 days. In both anaerobic and aerobic conditions,
the major metabolite of 2,4-D is 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP).10 2,4-DCP is also frequently detected in the environment.
2,4-DCP was detected in more than half of China’s surface water
samples with the highest concentration of 19 960 ng/L.11 In the surface water of the Taihu Lake, the
maximum concentration of 2,4-DCP was 143 ng/L.12 2,4-DCP is characterized by high toxicity and persistence
in the environment.13−15 2,4-DCP at low concentrations resulted in developmental
disorders in zebrafish embryos.14 In rats,
2,4-DCP had a weak reproductive toxicity. Therefore, it was listed
as priority pollutants by China as well as the United States.16

Metabolism of a pesticide is not necessarily
a process of detoxification.
On the one hand, the toxicity of a metabolite is not necessarily less
than that of its parent compound. It was shown that the acute toxicity
induced by imidacloprid was LD50 = 57 μg/kg and the
LD50s values of the metabolites were 258 μg/kg (5-hydroxyimidacloprid)
and 28 μg/kg (olefin), which suggested that the metabolite may
be more toxic (olefin) or less toxic (5-hydroxyimidacloprid) than
its parent.17 Some parent herbicides such
as 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, mecoprop, 2,4-D, and dichlorprop
displayed a less inhibitory activity to acetylcholinesterase than
their metabolites.18 On the other hand,
pesticides and their metabolites are often detected to coexist in
the same environmental medium19 to form
various mixtures. The combined toxicities of the mixtures of parent
pesticide and its metabolites may be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic.20 In other words, the toxicities of some mixtures
are predictable (for additive), whereas those of others are unpredictable
(for synergistic and antagonistic). For example, the mixtures of diuron
and its metabolites (1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methyl urea and 3,4-dichloroaniline)
resulted in synergism in almost all cases, for both species of phytoplankton,21 which implied that it is necessary to carefully
examine the mixture toxicity to reveal the possible risks of the mixture
to organisms. Cáceres et al.,22 who
were the first to study the interactive effect of chlorpyrifos and
its metabolite 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol to a cladoceran, also suggested
that the joint action of pesticides and their metabolites should be
considered in the development of water quality guidelines.

The
main purpose of this paper is to (1) determine the toxicities
of the pesticide (2,4-D) and its metabolite (2,4-DCP) as well as their
various mixtures to two nontarget organisms, the aquatic organism Vibrio qinghaiensis sp.-Q67 (Q67), a freshwater luminescent
bacterium widely used in the determination of toxicity of chemical
pollutants,23 and the terrestrial organism Caenorhabditis elegans having excellent characteristics
such as well-characterized genome, ease of maintenance, short and
prolific life cycle, and small body size, making it a good model for
toxicological analysis;24,25 (2) evaluate the toxicity
of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP to different tested organisms; and (3) reveal
whether the mixture toxicity can be predicted by the analysis of toxicological
interaction to provide the basic data for the possible risk assessment
caused by pesticide mixtures.

Results
Toxicity of a Single Chemical
The concentration–response
curves (CRCs) of pesticide (2,4-D) and its metabolite (2,4-DCP) to
Q67 are shown in Figure 1a. The fitted regression coefficients (α and β), statistics
[the fitted coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE)], and pEC50 (for Q67)
are given in Table 1. Figure 1a shows
that the four CRCs of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP to Q67 are all classical monotonic
S-shaped curves. The CRCs are different from each other and the toxicity
of 2,4-DCP is always more severe than that of 2,4-D at the same exposure
time and at any concentration level because the CRC of 2,4-DCP is
located on the left side of the CRC of 2,4-D. For example, taking
pEC50 as a toxicity index, the toxicity of 2,4-D (pEC50 = 2.768 and 2.873) is less than that of 2,4-DCP (3.417 and
4.152) (see Table 1) at two exposure times (0.25 and 12 h).

If the CRCs of the same chemical
at two exposure times are plotted
(see Figure S1a of the Supporting Information), it can be concluded that the two CRCs of 2,4-D to Q67 at 0.25
and 12 h are basically overlapping each other, whereas the CRCs of
2,4-DCP are different and the CRC at 12 h is located at the left side
of that at 0.25 h, which implies that the inhibition toxicities (I) of 2,4-DCP to Q67 at 12 h are more severe than those
at 0.25 h at many concentration levels. That is, different from 2,4-D,
2,4-DCP to Q67 has a time-dependent toxicity.

Figure 1b shows
that the CRC profiles of pesticide 2,4-D and its metabolite 2,4-DCP
to C. elegans are also classical S-shaped
curves, and at the same exposure time, the lethal toxicities (L) of 2,4-DCP to C. elegans are more severe than those of 2,4-D at any concentration level because
the CRCs of 2,4-DCP are located on the left side of those of 2,4-D.
For example, taking the pLC50 to C. elegans as a toxicity index, the pLC50 values of 2,4-DCP are
3.379 and 3.408 at 12 and 24 h, respectively, which are larger than
those (2.322 and 2.425) of 2,4-D (see Table 1).

If the CRCs of the same chemical
at two exposure times are plotted
(see Figure S1b of the Supporting Information), it can be concluded that two CRCs of 2,4-DCP or 2,4-D at two exposure
times are basically overlapping each other, which implies that 2,4-DCP
and 2,4-D have no time dependence to C. elegans.

Mixture Toxicity of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP
The 10 CRCs of
5 mixture rays (R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5) of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP to Q67
can be well described by Weibull or Logit functions (see Figure S2a
of the Supporting Information). The fitted
regression coefficients (α and β), statistics [the fitted
coefficient of determination (R2) and
RMSE], and pEC50 are given in Table 1. Figure S2a of the Supporting Information shows that the toxicity of mixture rays to Q67
is increasing with the exposure time. According to the pEC50 values of the mixture rays, the toxicity of the mixture ray increases
monotonically with the mixture ratio of 2,4-DCP at the same exposure
time. For example, the pEC50 values of R1, R2, R3, R4,
and R5 to Q67 are 2.722, 2.776, 3.076, 3.096, and 3.246 at 0.25 h
and 3.212, 3.415, 3.559, 3.761, and 3.936 at 12 h, respectively (see Table 1). The pEC50s of mixture rays is well correlated with the mixture ratios of 2,4-DCP
(p2,4-DCP) (see Figure 2a).

Figure 2 Linear relationship between p2,4-DCP and pEC50 [to Q67
(a)] or pLC50 [to C. elegans (b)] [solid curve (—) refers to
the fitted curve and dashed curves (---) to the 95% confidence intervals].

The 10 CRCs of 5 mixture rays
(R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5) of 2,4-D
and 2,4-DCP to C. elegans can be fitted
by Weibull function (see Figure S2b of the Supporting Information). Figure S2b shows that
the toxicity of mixture rays to C. elegans is not time dependent. According to the pLC50 values
of the mixture rays, the toxicity of the mixture ray monotonically
increases with the mixture ratio of 2,4-DCP at the same exposure time.
For example, the pEC50 values of R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5
to C. elegans are 2.433, 2.439, 2.414,
2.628, and 2.859 at 12 h and 2.462, 2.453, 2.450, 2.661, and 2.884
at 24 h, respectively (see Table 1).

The pLC50s of mixture rays are
well correlated with
the mixture ratios of 2,4-DCP (p2,4-DCP) (Figure 2b).

Toxicological
Interactions in Mixtures
Plots of combination
indices at a specific effect (x %) (CIx) with 95% observation-based confidence intervals
(OCIs) of five mixture rays to Q67 versus the percent effects (x %) are shown in Figure 3. From Figure 3, the toxicological interactions in mixtures to Q67 are basically
additive actions, in which R1 and R2 at 0.25 h have slight antagonism
at some concentration levels, whereas R2 at 12 h and R3 at 0.25 h
display slight synergism at some concentration levels, which may be
caused by experimental and fitting errors. It can be expected that
the mixture toxicity of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP can be predicted by the
concentration addition model from the concentration–response
information of single 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP.

24 h are almost more than 1, which illustrates the antagonism existing
in the mixtures.

Discussion
Different Model Organisms
Figures S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information illustrate that different
organisms have diverse responses to the same chemicals or mixture
rays. For instance, the herbicides such as simetryn, bromacil, and
hexazinone showed a more severe toxicity to Chlorella
pyrenoidosa and a lower toxicity to Q67, whereas the
fungicide metalaxyl possessed a high toxicity to Q67 but not to C. pyrenoidosa.26 In addition,
the interactions in the same binary mixtures are significantly different.
In this work, the toxicological interactions in mixtures to Q67 are
basically additive actions, whereas most of the mixture rays to C. elegans display antagonisms. The process of bioluminescence
is related to luciferase.27,28 Pesticides act as luciferase
inhibitors by preventing the luciferin from entering the luciferase-active
sites.29,30 The reason why binary pesticide mixtures
produce antagonism to C. elegans but
additive actions to Q67 is at present very unclear because of the
lack of the molecular mechanism of the relative mixtures, which need
urgent further study.

Different Toxic Effects of Parent Pesticide
and Its Metabolite
In this paper, to both tested organisms,
the toxicity of metabolite
2,4-DCP is more severe than that of the parent compound 2,4-D. This
result is consistent with previous reports.31−33 It may depend
on the phenoxy side chain length. Toxicity of phenoxyalkanoic acids
increases with a decrease in the phenoxy side chain length.34 Compared with 2,4-D, 2,4-DCP has a shorter phenoxy
side chain length and small volume and steric hindrance (see Figure 5), which makes 2,4-DCP
easily penetrate cell membranes and produce greater toxicity to organisms.
However, some parent compounds to tested organisms have higher toxicity
than their metabolites. The parent compound lactofen possessed higher
lethality to Daphnia magna than its
metabolites (e.g., desethyl lactofen and acifluorfen).35 These results indicate that attention should
be paid not only to the potential ecological and health risks of parent
pesticide but also to those of metabolites.

Combined Toxicity of Parent
Pesticide and Its Metabolite
This study would trigger attention
to the interaction between parent
compound and its metabolites. Generally, the joint toxicity of the
parent compound and its metabolites is considered to be additive when
the toxicants in the mixture behave in a similar way.22 In this study, the combined toxicity of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP
is either antagonistic (to C. elegans) or additive (to Q67). However, in the study by Cáceres et
al.,22 the combined mortality toxicity
of chlorpyrifos and its metabolite, 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol, to Daphnia carinata was additive or synergistic. These
findings show that the toxicological interaction in the mixture of
pesticide and its metabolite(s) is complicated and there is, at present,
no uniform law of combined toxicity. Therefore, more case studies
are needed.

Design of Mixtures
The toxicities
of mixtures not only
depend on the exposure time but also the mixture ratio and concentration
level.36 The study has come to the conclusion
that to both organisms, changes in mixture ratio lead to the change
of the toxicity of the mixture. In addition, different concentration
levels of the same ray with the same mixture ratio have different
toxicological interactions.37,38 Conventional mixture
design method, equivalent effective concentration (such as EC50) ratio ray or fixed concentration ratio ray design, often
only designs some mixtures with a mixture ratio and so cannot simulate
the concentration distribution of various components in a real environment
mixture. The EquRay (direct equipartition ray design) method developed
in our laboratory39 can rationally design
many representative mixture rays with many mixture ratios with the
least experiments. The toxicity test on these representative mixtures
can systematically and comprehensively measure the toxicity changes
of various mixtures.

Predictability of Mixture Toxicity
It is found that
the pEC50 or pLC50 of various mixture rays of
2,4-D and 2,4-DCP is well correlated with the mixture ratio of 2,4-DCP
(p2,4-DCP), whether to Q67 or C. elegans, at short-term exposure or long-term exposure,
which shows that the toxicity of any binary mixture can be predicted
by the mixture ratio (see Figure 3). However, the combined toxicity or toxicological
interaction is not always predictable because of the same mixture
ray to different test organisms or at different exposure times or
at different concentration levels having different toxicological interactions
(see Figure 4). The
literature by Li et al.40 indicated that
the toxicities of any mixtures having global concentration additivity
(GCA) can be predicted by the concentration addition model. It is
shown that the mixtures of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP to Q67 have the GCA feature
and their mixture toxicity can be predicable. In most cases, the toxicity
of mixtures to C. elegans is antagonistic
and not predictable. This unpredictable result and the predictable
results from linear correlation between pLC50 and the mixture
ratio of 2,4-DCP are contradictory, which reminds us that toxicological
and chemical interactions may not be the same. Therefore, caution
should be exercised in the study of the toxicological mechanism associated
with the mixtures.

Conclusions
In this paper, Q67 and C. elegans were selected as tested organisms to evaluate
the toxicities of
the pesticide (2,4-D) and its metabolite (2,4-DCP) as well as their
various mixtures. Only considering one organism or one exposure time,
the potential ecological and health risks of 2,4-D and its metabolite
2,4-DCP as well as their mixtures might be underestimated or even
misestimated. These results remind that when evaluating the risks
of pesticides, the potential of its metabolites and their mixtures
should come into notice.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
2,4-D
and 2,4-DCP (the molecular structures
shown in Figure 5)
were purchased from Sigma (USA). Some physical properties and the
concentration of stocks are listed in Table 2. All stock solutions were prepared in Milli-Q
water with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and stored in darkness at 4 °C
before being used.

Bioluminescence Inhibition
to Q67
The freeze-dried
Q67 was purchased from Beijing Hamamatsu Corp., Ltd. (Beijing, China).
The medium formula, culture condition, and the relative light unit
(RLU) determination are performed according to the method described
previously in the literature by Xu et al.41 The toxic effect (E) of a chemical or a mixture
ray to Q67 is expressed as a bioluminescence inhibition (I), calculated as follows: 1  where aR0 is the average of the
RLU of Q67 exposed to the controls (24 parallels), and aR is the average
of the RLU of the test toxicant or mixture (three parallels) in one
microplate. Considering the effect of time on a bioluminescence inhibition,
the exposure times are set as 0.25 and 12 h, respectively.

Lethal
Toxicity to C. elegans
Wild-type
strains (N2) of C.
elegans and Escherichia coli OP50 (the food for C. elegans) were
gained from the Institute of Medicine, Tongji University. E. Coli OP50 culture refers to Girard et al.42 The C. elegans culture, blank and treatment group design, and lethality autoscaling
are performed according to the method described previously by Tang
et al.43 The toxic effect (E) of a chemical or a mixture ray to C. elegans is expressed as lethality (L) of worms.43 2  where
Ben refers to the average number of
worms at a certain time in the six blanks and Cen refers to the numbers
of surviving C. elegans exposed to
a chemical or a mixture ray after normalization. Considering the effect
of time on lethality, the exposure times are set as 12 and 24 h, respectively.

Design of Binary Mixtures
2,4-D with different concentrations
and its metabolite, 2,4-DCP with diverse concentrations, coexisted
in aquatic environment and constituted a complex binary mixture system.
In order to explore the toxicity rule of the whole mixture concentration
space effectively and reasonably, the EquRay method39,44 was selected to design five concentration ratios in the binary mixture
system. Five concentration ratios correspond to five mixture rays
(denoted as R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5). The concentration ratios of 2,4-D
and 2,4-DCP for EC50 (Q67) or LC50 (C. elegans) analysis are 5:1, 4:2, 3:3, 2:4, and
1:5, respectively. The concentration fractions or mixture ratios of
the ith component (pi) is defined as the ratio of the concentration of
the ith component in a mixture (i = 2,4-D or 2,4-DCP) to the total concentration of the mixture.45 3  

The values of various pis in mixture rays and the
concentrations
of stocks of various rays are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.

Concentration–Response
Model
To describe the
toxic effects (E) of various concentrations (c) quantitatively, especially at low concentrations, the
concentration effect data were fitted to two nonlinear functions,
Weibull (eq 4) and Logit
(eq 5).44 4   5  where α and β are the location
and shape parameters of the CRC to be estimated.

The goodness
of fit is described by the fitted coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE. The higher the R2 or the lower the RMSE, the better is the fit.46 The 95% OCIs of the fitted CRC are constructed
by the APTox program44,47,48

Toxicological Interaction Evaluation
The toxicological
interaction in the mixture is qualitatively identified by the concentration
addition model.29 The CIx38 values were calculated to quantitatively
describe the degree of toxicological interaction (eq 6). 6  where m is the number of
components in the mixture, ECx,i is the effect concentration of the ith component
that provokes the effect of (I or L) x % when applied singly, and ci is the concentration of the ith component in the mixture that provokes the effect of
(I or L) x %.

When 1 is between the 95% OCIs, the interaction is considered as
an additive action or no interaction.37 When 1 is under the lower limit or above the upper limit of the
OCIs, it is illustrated as the antagonism or synergism existing in
mixtures, respectively.38
