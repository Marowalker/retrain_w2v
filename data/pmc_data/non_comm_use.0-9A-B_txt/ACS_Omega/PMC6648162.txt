MXene
as a kind of two-dimensional nanomaterial has aroused people’s
strong research interest because of its excellent properties. In the
present study, we introduced a new poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(acrylic
acid)/Fe3O4/MXene@Ag nanoparticle composite
film fabricated by electrospinning and heat treatment as well as self-reduction
reaction process. The obtained composite films showed high self-reduction
ability because of the incorporation of MXene flakes. The intercalated
MXene flakes in the composite nanofibers were evenly distributed,
which not only solved the aggregation problem from MXene dispersion
but also could self-reduce Ag nanoparticles in situ in composite materials.
In addition, the composite nanofiber films exhibited good fiber structure,
thermal stability, and magnetic properties. Moreover, the composite
nanofiber films demonstrated excellent catalytic ability and cycle
stability to 4-nitrophenol and 2-nitroaniline.

1 Introduction
In recent years, MXene’s
extraordinary physical and chemical
properties and layered structure have made it a new type of two-dimensional
(2D) material that is popular after graphene.1−3 MXene is a transition
metal nitride/carbon nano-2D layered material that was first prepared
by Naguib in 2011.4 The structure of MXene
can be represented by Mn+1XnTx.5 In short, M represents a transition metal element, X represents
a C or N element, and Tx represents a
functional terminal such as −O, −OH, −F, and
so on.6 In this structural formula, n can take 1, 2, or 3.7 MXene
is a layered material obtained by etching away the Al layer by MAX.8 It has great application prospects in electrochemistry,
magnetism, and optic fields.9−20 Particularly, the MXene flake obtained by delaminating is one of
the most valuable nanomaterials.21−25 The nanosheet has a large specific surface area and
can be used in the production of new functional hybrid material building
blocks.26−30 However, the MXene nanosheets are easy to aggregate in solution
and oxidized easily, which have become a challenge that needs to be
solved urgently.

To solve these problems, the researchers focused
on the separation
of flakes and the modification of the surface MXene flakes. For example,
Wang et al. stratified MXene by modification of sulfonic acid diazonium
salts and ultrasound.9 The obtained large-scale
MXene flakes have stable properties and not easy to agglomerate. Boota
et al. prepared PPy/Ti3C2Tx composites by modifying polypyrrole on the surface of MXene
sheets.7 It was found that pyrrole (C4H4NH) can simultaneously be embedded, aligned,
and metal-free polymerized on Ti3C2Tx MXene. In addition, PPy/Ti3C2Tx composite exhibits excellent electrochemical
properties. Ling et al. prepared Ti3C2Tx/polymer flexible composite material by mixing
MXene (Ti3C2Tx)
with charged polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride or electrically
neutral polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which can enhance cation embedding
and increase capacitance, and has a high potential for electrochemical
applications.11 Researchers have indeed
made outstanding contributions in fully exploiting MXene. However,
the problem of easy aggregation of MXene sheets has not been completely
solved. In addition, its self-reducing precious metal properties are
masked after the MXene flakes’ surface has been modified. On
the other hand, self-assembled composites are widely prepared and
applied because of their good properties.31−33 Nitro compounds
are one of the common water pollutants. In particular, 4-nitrophenol
(4-NP) and 2-nitroaniline (2-NA) are typically harmful compounds for
humans and environment because of their high solubility and toxicity.
Therefore, it is very important to develop new materials that can
effectively catalyze 4-NP and 2-NA.34,35

To solve
the problems mentioned above, we designed and successfully
synthesized PVA/poly(acrylic acid)/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP
(PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP) functional nanocomposites
in combination with the electrospinning technology. It is well-known
that the electrospinning technology is a technology capable of producing
continuous microfilaments with a diameter scale of nanometer or micrometer.
The morphology, diameter scale, and stacked density of fibers can
be regulated by adjusting process parameters and environmental conditions.36 In our research, the solvent used ultrapure
water, and the spinning materials were PVA and PAA, all of which were
water soluble and ecofriendly materials, nonpolluting, and easily
degradable. Fe3O4 was added to the spinning
material, and the composite nanofiber materials could exhibit magnetic
properties.37−40 Moreover, Fe3O4 was easy to recycle.37 The MXene flake colloidal solution was obtained
by dispersing MXene powder in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for later
experiments.41 The composite nanofiber
materials were prepared by mixing PVA, PAA, Fe3O4, and MXene components via the electrospinning technology and next
modification with Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs).42 This obtained composite fiber material not only made full use of
the self-reducing properties of MXene sheet itself but also solved
the aggregation problem from MXene dispersion. The MXene flakes were
stretched out on the surface of the obtained fiber. The reduction
characteristics of the MXene nanosheet itself could reduce Ag+ in the AgNO3 solution to AgNPs at the active site
on the surface of the nanosheet.41,42 As reaction
time continued, AgNPs grew and aggregated, eventually forming Ag nanoclusters.8,41 In this report, we explored the synthesis and characterization of
novel PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP composite nanofibers.
This composite fiber material exhibited excellent properties for catalytic
reduction of nitro compounds such as 2-NA and 4-NP.43,44 In addition, we investigated the size of self-reduced AgNPs and
their catalytic effects on 2-NA and 4-NP at different reduction times.45−48 The experimental results showed that the prepared PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP composite nanofibers demonstrated
a great potential in the field of composite catalyst materials and
wastewater treatment.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of Composite
Fibers
First, Figure 1 indicated the preparation process of PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP composite nanofibers. We exfoliated layered
MAX (Ti3AlC2) powders by treating them in 40%
HF solution at 25 °C.42 Selective
HF etching originated from only “A” layers from the
MAX phase.49 Then, MAX became a multilayer
MXene phase. In many cases, such as thermal treatment, sonication
and reactions of volume expansion in the interlayer space would lead
to deintercalation of some certain compounds and exfoliation.50 DMSO has been reported to intercalate MXene
at room temperature because DMSO could increase the c-lattice parameter
of MXene from 19.5 ± 0.1 to 35.04 ± 0.02 Å.50 The DMSO-intercalated MXene sonicated in water
lead to themselves being delaminated into separate flakes similar
to “paper” and formation of nanosheet colloidal solution.41 Multilayer MXene was intercalated with DMSO
and ultrasonically dispersed to obtain MXene nanosheet colloidal solution
for the next step of electrospinning. PVA, PAA, Fe3O4, and MXene nanosheet colloidal solution were mixed in proportion
to form an electrospinning precursor solution. Through electrospinning,
we obtained composite nanofibers with MXene flake “wings”.
When the composite nanofibers were placed in a slowly stirred AgNO3 solution, a [Ag+-DMSO] complex monomer was first
formed.41 The rapidly transferred electrons
form oxygen lone pair electrons ([ÖS–(CH3)2]) leading to the formation of Ag+–[DMSO].41 The charge was transferred between Ag–MXene
complexes to initialize the dimerized MXene–Ag DMSO.41 The MXene–Ag dimeric complexes were bonded
to −OH and reduced to stable Ag0 nanoclusters.41,42 As the nanoclusters were further nucleated and grown on the surface
of the MXene nanosheets, spherical AgNPs were formed.41,42 With the increment of self-reduction time, they may have a small
amount of AgNPs drifted/anchored on the surface of polymer fibers.
Finally, the AgNP-loaded composite nanofibers were successfully prepared.
It should be noted that the layered MXene nanosheets were firmly “locked”
on the fiber surface by composite nanofibers to achieve high dispersibility,
which solved the problem that MXene nanosheets were easy to aggregate.
In addition, the MXene flakes were not modified by any functional
groups, and their original properties were preserved. This experiment
is based on the reaction mechanism of in situ formation of AgNP@MXene
hybrids.42 The MXene nanosheet has a large
specific surface area, and the surface has a reduction/nucleation
site of the original AgNPs. Furthermore, the surface of MXene contains
an −OH functional group, which can bond with Ag+ ions.41 Over enough time, AgNPs continue
to grow to form stable Ag nanospheres on the fiber surface. The composite
nanofibers used to catalyze 4-NP and 2-NA also obtained good catalytic
effects.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the preparation process of the present
composite fibers.

Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of Figure 2a showed that the MXene with layered structure
by etching off the Al layer was clearly visible. A drop of the MXene
nanosheet colloidal solution was deposited on a copper foil, and the
nanosheets were clearly observed though SEM (Figure 2b) after being dried at 70 °C. It was
clear from Figure 2 that the nanosheets were very thin and evenly distributed. Figure 2c demonstrated that
the average size of the nanosheets was 350 nm. The photograph of Figure 2c′ represented
a colloidal solution of MXene nanoflakes that exhibited the Tyndall
scattering effect when the beam passed through. Figure 2d demonstrated clearly that the representative
MXene flakes were thin and stacked.

(b) typical SEM image of MXene flakes; and (c) size distribution of
MXene flakes. The inset image (c′) denoted MXene flakes colloidal
solution with Tyndall scattering effect and (d) representative TEM
image of MXene flakes.

Figure 3 showed
the composite nanofibers with different micromorphology. The SEM image
in Figure 3a showed
PVA/PAA uniform nanofibers with the optimal parameter of 15 kV-20
cm-0.5 mL/h and the average size of the diameter of 500 nm. The SEM
image (Figure 3b) of
PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene composite nanofibers demonstrated
that the morphology of the fibers changed after Fe3O4 and MXene were added under same parameters. From Figure 3b, it could be easily
seen that some Fe3O4 particles appeared in the
fiber. Furthermore, local fusion between the fibers occurred, which
could be caused by the presence of a small number of micron-sized
MXene large layers. The fiber diameter became uneven. Figure 3c showed that a SEM image of
the PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene composite nanofibers
appeared cross-linked in plane after thermal treatment at 120 °C
for 5 h. Fe3O4 nanocubes with an average size
of 100 nm embedded in the composite nanofibers were clearly visible,
as shown in Figure 3d. The presence of Fe3O4 NPs made the composite
fibers magnetic and recyclable.

(b) PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene nanofibers; (c) PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene nanofibers with thermal treatment for

TEM image of cube Fe3O4 NPs inside nanofiber.

As shown in Figure 4a, it clearly showed that the surface of
the fiber was embedded with
the MXene nanosheets similar to the fiber growing “wings”.
It could be clearly seen from the partially magnified transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 4b) of the composite nanofiber that the AgNPs
were loaded onto the MXene nanosheet. This confirmed that PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@Ag composite nanofibers were successful
prepared. Figure 4c
further confirmed Fe3O4, MXene, and AgNP coexisted
and distributed in the obtained composite nanofibers. In addition,
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy shown in Figure 4d demonstrated that the elements
of C, O, Fe, Ti, and Ag were presented in PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP composite nanofibers, indicating the successful
preparation of composite nanofibers again.

(c) TEM image with C/O/Fe/Ti/Ag elemental mapping of PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP fibers; and (d) representative EDX
image of composite nanofibers.

High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images demonstrated that AgNPs
were
single crystals. In the process of Ag reduction in situ by MXene flakes,
with the increase of reduction time, AgNPs grew slowly. Figure 5b,e,h showed the interplanar
spacing of lattice with d(111) of 0.238 nm and d(200) of 0.208 nm.37 The formed
AgNPs showed the average particle size of 12 ± 5 nm at 10 min,
as shown in Figure 5c. Furthermore, AgNPs in composite nanofibers displayed an average
size of 17 ± 5 nm (Figure 5f) at 20 min and 22 ± 5 nm (Figure 5i) at 60 min, respectively, which indicated
the slow increment of AgNP particle size with the reduction reaction
time.

composite nanofibers after loaded Ag NPs at 10, 20, and 60 min; (b,e,h)

of Ag NPs at (a,d,g).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were used to identify strong
affiliation
in composite nanofibers. Figure 6a indicated the diffraction patterns of the MXene powder,
Fe3O4 NPs, PVA/PAA nanofibers, PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene composite nanofibers, and PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP composite nanofibers. XRD curves
of the MXene powder clearly indicated the peaks at 2θ = 8.90°,
18.24°, and 27.65° which was attributed to (002), (006),
and (008) crystal plane, respectively.42,43 According
to the XRD patterns of the face-centered cubic Fe3O4 phase, the 2θ values were observed at 30.0°, 35.3°,
43.0°, 57.0°, and 62.7° which were attributed to the
(220), (311), (400), (511), and (400) crystal planes.37−40 The peaks of XRD were observed at 20.24° (PVA/PAA) and 19.29°
(PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene), which indicated the addition
of the Fe3O4 NPs and MXene flakes in the composite
nanofiber layers.37 In addition, the inset
shows the characteristic peaks of AgNPs in the XRD pattern corresponding
to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, which further confirmed
the loading of AgNPs successfully. As shown in Figure 6b, the thermal stability of different composite
nanofibers was measured. The weight loss was observed at 150 °C,
which indicated that the absorbed water was removed. Also, from 280
to 480 °C, the sharp weight loss could be because of the thermal
decomposition of carbon chain. The weight values of the samples remained
constant when the temperature reached 500 °C.36,37 Furthermore, it indicated that the PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP composite nanofibers demonstrated better thermal stability.
The heat loss of the PVA/PAA/Fe3O4 composite
nanofibers was 72.55%, whereas the PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene and PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/Mxene@AgNP composite
nanofibers lost 66.94 and 58.8%, respectively. The difference in heat
loss was mainly because of the addition of MXene nanosheets and the
loading of AgNPs.

composite
nanofibers. The inset shows the illustration of the partial enlargement
in the XRD curve of PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP
composite.

Magnetic properties of different
samples were investigated at room
temperature using magnetization hysteresis loops, as shown in Figure 7. The fully reversible
field-dependent magnetization curve proved that all materials were
superparamagnetic with no coercivity and remanence.37 The PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene composite
nanofibers showed 39.9 emu/g saturation magnetization values at 20
kOe.37−40 The saturation magnetization value was reduced to 10.9 emu/g after
AgNPs were loaded for 60 min. The saturation magnetization decreased
with the prolongation of AgNP loading.37 The saturation magnetization of PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/Mxene@AgNPs was 22.3 and 19.33 emu/g at 10 and 20 min, respectively.

We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
technique to study
and investigate the elemental components and composition. The XPS
patterns indicated the characteristic peaks of C 1s, O 1s, and Ag
3d, as shown in Figure 8a. The obvious peaks at 368 and 374 eV from AgNPs in samples were
assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2,42 as shown in Figure 8b. This indicated that AgNPs existed in the
form of a simple substance. Similarly, the peaks at 718.8 and 736.4
eV correspond to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively.
In addition, we analyzed the oxygen and carbon elements and found
that the peak positions at 284.5 eV and 285.7 represented C–C,
C–OH, C–O, C=O, and O=C–O, respectively.
The peak positions at 532.1 and 532.8 eV represented C–O bond
and C=O bonds, respectively. Figure 8f showed an energy spectrum (EDS) of the
composite nanofibers, showing that the composite fibers contained
carbon, oxygen, iron, and silver elements. In summary, the above results
indicated that the obtained AgNPs had been successfully anchored on
composite nanofibers.

2.2 Catalytic Performances of Composite Fibers
The catalytic reaction of PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/Mxene@AgNP
composite nanofibers on nitro compounds could reflect their catalytic
properties. To investigate the catalytic activity of the composite
nanofibers, fresh NaBH4 aqueous solution (20 mL, 0.01 mol/L)
was poured into 2-NA (2 mL, 5 mmol/L) or 4-NP (2 mL, 5 mmol/L), and
then composite nanofibers were placed in a solution to measure their
reducibility by UV–vis spectroscopy at room temperature.43−46Figure 9a showed
that the UV–vis absorption peak of 4-NP changes from 317 to
402 nm after NaBH4 was added, which was due to the formation
of 4-nitrophenolate. The color of 4-NP and NaBH4 mixture
unchanged for 24 h without catalyst indicated that the reaction did
not occur. After the addition of the composite nanofibers, the peak
of 4-NP gradually decreased at 402 nm until it no longer changed,
which means that 4-NP was completely reduced (Figure 9b). In the experiment, the concentration
of NaBH4 was 400 times than that of 4-NP, and the whole
process of catalyzing 4-NP could be regarded as the pseudo-first-order
reaction. A linear relationship between ln(Ct/C0) and time
(t) in the catalytic reaction was shown in Figure 9c, demonstrating
that the catalytic reaction fitted pseudo-first-order reaction (Ct-concentration, C0-initial concentration, and t-time).
The reaction rate of the catalytic reaction was 0.168 min–1 (Figure 9c), suggesting
that the PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/Mxene@AgNP20 composite
nanofibers showed good catalytic activity for 4-NP.

adding NaBH4 aqueous solution; (b,e) catalytic reduction

composite nanofibers; and (c,f) relationship between ln(Ct/C0) and
the reaction time (t) of composite nanofiber catalyst.

To further evaluate the catalytic
activity of the composite nanofibers,
we conducted a 2-NA catalytic reaction experiment.51 The color of 4-NA and NaBH4 mixture remained
unchanged for 24 h without the catalyst. The UV–vis absorption
peak position of 2-NA was still at 415 nm after adding NaBH4, as shown in Figure 9d. After adding an appropriate amount of composite fiber, the catalytic
reaction was completed within 1 h, and the catalytic effect of the
composite fiber was shown in (Figure 9e). Similarly, the catalytic reaction of the composite
nanofibers to 2-NA could also be considered as a pseudo-first-order
reaction (Figure 9f).
The reaction rate of the catalytic reaction was 0.152 min–1, which proved that the complex had a good catalytic activity for
2-NA. In addition, we also evaluated the catalytic performances of
the other two samples (PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/Mxene@AgNP10
and PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/Mxene@AgNP60) for 4-NP and
2-NA, and the completed time of the catalytic reaction for 4-Np and
2-NA seemed larger than 90 min, which showed a similar phenomenon
in our previous MXene-AuNP system.43 In
addition, in the present study, the combination of MXene with PAA
and PVA could improve the dispersion and surface area of MXene sheets,
enhancing the active sites for reduction and loading of Ag NPs. Moreover,
the addition of Fe3O4 enabled the composites
to be easily recycled.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
new AgNP-loaded PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene composite
nanofiber materials were prepared via electrospinning
technology and self-reduction reaction of MXene flakes with AgNO3. The MXene flakes, scaled from 200 to 400 nm, were successfully
stripped on multilayer MXene by DMSO intercalation and subsequent
sonication, and large-scale dispersion was achieved. The MXene nanosheets
embedded in the fiber by electrospinning technology not only achieved
high-dispersion targets but also retained its own physicochemical
properties. By controlling the time of the self-reduction reaction,
it seemed a facile approach to prepare AgNP-loaded fiber composites
with different particle sizes and exhibited different catalytic properties
for 2-NA and 4-NP. The PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP
composite nanofibers exhibited excellent reactive activity for the
catalytic reaction of certain nitro compounds (such as 2-NA and 4-NP),
which was attributed to the special structural characteristics of
the composite nanofibers and the good Ag-based catalytic activity.
Moreover, the composite nanofiber materials could exhibit magnetic
properties because of the addition of Fe3O4 NPs.
The experimental results showed that the obtained PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP20 composite nanofibers displayed the best
catalytic performance. Thus, the present work provided a new idea
for the preparation of new MXene-based composite nanomaterials for
wastewater treatment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Instruments
PVA (MW
57 000–66 000, 98–99% hydrolyzed), poly(acrylic
acid) (PAA, MW ≈ 2000), 4-NP, and 2-NA were purchased from
Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai, China). Fe3O4 and
MXene (Ti3C2Tx)
were synthesized in the laboratory according to previous studies.52−54 AgNO3 (98%) was obtained from Tianyi (Tianjin, China).
DMSO (99%) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%) were purchased
from Kermel Chemicals (Tianjin, China) and Alfa Aesar (Beijing, China),
respectively. All chemicals used in this experiment were without further
purification. Ultrapure water was purified by the experimental Milli-Q
Millipore filter system which was purchased from Millipore Corporation
(USA).

SEM (Hitachi S4800, Ibaraki, Japan) and TEM (Hitachi
HT7700, Ibaraki, Japan) were used to characterize sample morphology.
The HRTEM images were obtained by a JEM-2010 electron microscope at
200 kV. A SMART LAB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a Bragg
diffraction apparatus and a Cu Kα X-ray radiation source were
utilized to get XRD patterns. Catalytic experiments were measured
by UV-2550 spectrophotometer. XPS analysis was obtained by a Thermo
Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi XPS (San Jose, CA, USA) with 200 W monochromatic
Al Kα radiations. The magnetization was performed by MPMS-XL
superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (San Diego,
CA, USA) at a temperature of 300 K. Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis
was performed by a simultaneous thermal analyzer (NETZSCH STA 409
PC Luxx, Seligenstadt, Germany) under argon atmosphere.

4.2 Sample Preparation
Multilayer MXene
(Ti3C2Tx) was obtained
by etching the Al element from MAX (Ti3AlC2)
via HF acid. MXene flake colloidal suspension was prepared by powder
separation and water bath sonication (Shenhuatai SUS304 Ultrasonic
bath, 110 W and 40 kHz). In short, 36 mg of MXene powder was mixed
with 2 mL of DMSO and then magnetically stirred at 18 °C for
18 h to ensure that DMSO was intercalated in the multilayer structure
of MXene. The intercalated MXene mixture would be centrifuged at 3500
rpm for 15 min to obtain a solid powder after removal of the supernatant.
Then, 9 mL of ultrapure water was added to the DMSO-intercalated MXene
residue at 10 °C. After a weak sonication with 110 W and 40 kHz
frequency, the few MXene with intercalated DMSO were dispersed in
ultrapure water. Fully delaminated Ti3C2 flake
colloidal solutions were obtained. The residue was removed by centrifugation
at 3500 rpm for 1 h to obtain a dark green MXene foil colloidal solution.
The sizes of the nanosheets were mostly 200–500 nm, and the
colloidal solution was relatively stable.

PVA (0.5 g) was added
to 4.5 g of the colloidal solution of MXene flakes to form 10 wt %
solutions and then stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. Fe3O4 (50 mg) solid was added to the above PVA solution and stirred
for 1 h at 25 °C. PAA (0.6 g) was added to 1.4 g of MXene flake
colloid solution to form 30 wt % solution and then stirred at 25 °C
for 1 h. We mixed all of the solutions together and stirred at 25
°C until uniform, which was the spinning precursor solution for
next steps. During the electrospinning process, a 10 mL syringe load
of PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene precursor solution was
connected to a stainless steel needle through a thin tube. We choose
the optimal parameter conditions: 15 kV (needle tip voltage)-20 cm
(working distance)-0.5 mL/h (feed rate of solutions). Then, spinning
was carried out at 25 °C and 40% humidity. The obtained electrospun
nanofibers were deposited on the surface of the aluminum foil and
then dried in vacuum at 25 °C for 24 h. After that, heat-induced
cross-linking reaction of the obtained electrospun nanofibers occurred
when heated at 120 °C for 5 h.31 After
thermal treatment and heat-induced cross-linking reaction, PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene membranes were insoluble in water because
of the esterification reaction between some of the partial hydroxyl
groups and carboxylic acid groups. Next, the spun fiber membrane was
immersed into 2.5 mg/mL AgNO3 solution and gently stirred
at 25 °C for Ag NP reduction growth. The PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP composite nanofibers were obtained with
different immersion times (10, 20, and 60 min, respectively). The
composite nanofibers were then taken out of AgNO3 aqueous
solution, washed with ultrapure water three times to remove nonadhered
or free AgNO3 NPs, and then dried at 30 °C for 24
h in vacuum.

4.3 Catalytic Performance Test
The catalytic
performance of PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP electrospun
nanofibers was determined by catalytic reduction of the solutions
of 4-NP and 2-NA.55−60 The reducing agent selected in the catalytic reduction reaction
was NaBH4, and the whole reaction process was carried out
under ultraviolet spectrum detection at 25 °C.47 4-NP aqueous solution (10 mL, 0.005 M) was prepared, and
fresh aqueous NaBH4 solution (20 mL, 0.1 M) was added,
and then PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene@AgNP (40 mg) was
added to the mixed solution for 60 min (named as PVA/PAA/Fe3O4/MXene @ AgNP60). The absorbance of the mixed solution
was monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy every 3 min until the
absorbance of the solution was minimized and remained unchanged. At
the same time, we evaluated the catalytic ability of nanofibers by
catalyzing 2-NA (10 mL, 0.005 M) aqueous solution again. After the
catalysis was completed, the nanofiber sample can be taken out by
an external magnetic field.61−64
