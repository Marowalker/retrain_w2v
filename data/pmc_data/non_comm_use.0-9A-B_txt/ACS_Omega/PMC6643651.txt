Cyclic peptides containing
tryptophan (W) and arginine (R) residues,
[WR]5, [WR]6, [WR]7, [WR]8, and [WR]9, were synthesized through Fmoc solid-phase
chemistry to compare their molecular transporter efficiency. The in
vitro cytotoxicity of the peptides was evaluated using human leukemia
carcinoma cell line (CCRF-CEM) and normal kidney cell line (LLC-PK1).
[WR]6, [WR]7, [WR]8, and [WR]9 were not significantly cytotoxic to LLC-PK1cells at a concentration
of 10 μM after 3 h incubation. Among all the peptides, [WR]9 was found to be a more efficient transporter than [WR]5, [WR]6, [WR]7, and [WR]8 in CCRF-CEM cells for delivery of a cell-impermeable fluorescence-labeled
negatively charged phosphopeptide (F′-GpYEEI). [WR]9 (10 μM) improved the cellular uptake of F′-GpYEEI (2
μM) by 20-fold. The cellular uptake of a fluorescent conjugate
of [WR]9, F′-[W9R8K], was
increased in a concentration- and time-dependent pattern in CCRF-CEM
cells. The uptake of F′-[W9R8K] was slightly
reduced in CCRF-CEM cells in the presence of different endocytic inhibitors,
such as nystatin, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride,
chlorpromazine, chloroquine, and methyl β-cyclodextrin. Furthermore,
the uptake of F′-[W9R8K] was shown to
be temperature-dependent and slightly adenosine 5′-triphosphate-dependent.
The intracellular/cellular localization (in the nucleus and cytoplasm)
of F′-[W9R8K] was confirmed by fluorescent
microscopy in CCRF-CEM cells. These studies suggest that large cyclic
peptides containing arginine and tryptophan can be used as a molecular
transporter of specific compounds.

==== Body
Introduction
The properties of the
cell membrane create a barrier for the efficient
cellular delivery of therapeutics. The cell membrane contains phospholipids,
which are negatively charged and extremely hydrophobic. The phospholipids
have been shown to obstruct the transportation of negatively charged
or water-insoluble molecules. For example, phosphopeptides are cell-impermeable
compounds that are used as probes for studying phosphoprotein–protein
interactions.1−3 Phosphopeptides consist of negatively charged phosphate
groups that create an obstacle for them to enter the negatively charged
phospholipids that make up the cell membrane of cells. Furthermore,
a number of anticancer and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
agents have limited cellular uptake and/or a more efficient uptake
is required for improving their biological properties. Thus, the development
of cellular delivery systems for enhancing the delivery of cell-impermeable
compounds, such as phosphopeptides, and/or improving the delivery
of other biologically important compounds is urgently needed.

Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been introduced as a drug
delivery system for various applications.4−6 CPPs have been
shown to facilitate drug transport across the cell membrane and increase
the cellular uptake of the drug. Other commonly used drug delivery
systems include liposomes and micelles. Encapsulating the drug in
a liposome has demonstrated to increase the efficiency of drug delivery
and prevent damage to the normal tissue. However, a previous study
has shown that liposomes still cause drug leakage,7 especially for highly hydrophilic drugs such as doxorubicin
(Dox) that is one of the most widely administered drugs for the treatment
of cancer.8 Cancer cells can develop resistance
to certain types of anticancer drugs, such as Dox. Furthermore, the
high dose of the drug has been shown to cause irreversible damage
to the cardiac muscle.9 Thus, the advancement
of efficient and safe vehicles to enhance the targeted delivery of
drugs to specific cells needs further studies.

There are many
ways that the cellular uptake of CPPs may occur.
The most common ways include direct penetration and endocytosis. Direct
penetration may include inverted micelle formation and pore formation.
The endocytotic pathway involves several pathways, such as macropinocytosis,
phagocytosis, endocytosis-independent of clathrin, or endocytosis-dependent
on the coat proteins clathrin or caveolin.10,11 The CPPs that enter through an endosomal pathway may be degraded
by enzymes or have an inadequate amount of drug released in the cytoplasm
or nucleus. The best strategy to overcome this limitation is to create
a compound that will bypass the endosomal pathway or enhance the rate
of escape from the endosome.12

We
have previously reported the application of cyclic peptide CPPs
containing arginine (R) and tryptophan (W) residues for delivery of
different cargo molecules. The data confirmed that cyclic peptides
containing alternating tryptophan and arginine residues, [WR]4 and [WR]5, improved the cellular uptake of compounds,
such as anti-HIV drugs, Dox, phosphopeptides, and siRNA or generated
peptide nanostructures.13−21 Studies also showed that the amino acid sequences in this peptide
were oriented in such a way to allow the peptide to cross the cell
membrane easily without causing cytotoxicity in the cell.9 Cyclic peptides were more rigid and expected
to be more stable toward proteolytic degradation. The cyclic nature
of the peptides provided higher stability versus the linear counterparts
and more efficient cell penetration. We also showed that the cellular
uptake of [WR]4 and [WR]5 is independent of
the endocytotic pathway.13 We have also
reported that [WR]5 and [WR]5-capped gold nanoparticles
improved the cellular delivery of siRNA in HeLa cells by 2- and 3.8-fold,
respectively.16

In continuation of
our efforts to develop structure–cellular
uptake relationship for cyclic peptides containing W and R residues,
herein we synthesized and evaluated amphiphilic cyclic CPPs composed
of increasing numbers of W and R residues, compared their efficiency
with [WR]5 in improving the cellular uptake of cell-impermeable
compounds, established structure–molecular transporter efficiency
relationship, and evaluated the mechanism of cellular uptake.

Thus, five cyclic peptides, [WR]5, [WR]6,
[WR]7, [WR]8, and [WR]9, were synthesized
containing alternate tryptophan and arginine residues (Figure 1). The studies allowed us to
determine if there was any effect on the molecular transporter efficiency
of the cyclic peptide by increasing the number of hydrophobic and
positively charged residues. Cytotoxicity of the cyclic peptides was
determined to find an appropriate noncytotoxic concentration for cellular
uptake studies. Using leukemia cancer (CCRF-CEM) cells, the cellular
uptake studies were evaluated to measure the uptake of fluorescence-labeled
compounds [e.g., phosphopeptide, stavudine (d4T), emtricitabine (FTC),
lamivudine (3TC)] in the presence of the synthesized peptides [WR]5, [WR]6, [WR]7, [WR]8, and
[WR]9 compared to parent analogs in the absence of the
synthesized peptides. Structure–molecular transporter efficiency
relationship of the compounds was determined. A fluorescence-labeled
derivative of the most efficient peptide was evaluated in the presence
and absence of different endocytosis inhibitors, and the uptake was
evaluated using fluorescence microscopy.

synthesized cyclic peptides.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
Fmoc-solid phase peptide
synthesis and solution
phase synthesis was used to synthesize all the peptides [WR]x (x = 5–9) (Figure 1). The linear side-chain protected peptides
were assembled on H-Trp(Boc)-2-chlorotrityl resin first. After the
cleavage of the peptides from the resin in the presence of dichloromethane
(DCM)/trifluoroethanol (TFE)/acetic acid (AcOH), the N- to C-terminal cyclization was conducted in the
presence of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide
(DIC), 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). Final deprotection
was carried out, and the peptides were purified using reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by
using high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. As a representative
example, the synthesis of [WR]9 is depicted in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of [WR]9.
To synthesize the
fluorescence-labeled cyclic peptide (Scheme 2), the peptide sequence
was partially modified. The N-terminal arginine was
replaced with Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH. Appropriately protected amino acids
were assembled on H-Trp(Boc)-2-chlorotrityl resin (0.3 mmol/g) according
to the solid-phase synthesis strategy described above. After the cyclization
and removal of all protecting groups, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl
ester (NHS) of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (F′) was used for labeling
the peptide. [W9R8]K peptide and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (FAMNHS) were coupled in the
presence of DIPEA in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The coupling reaction was completed in
overnight. The purification was conducted according to the described
general method above used for other cyclic peptides to yield F′-[W9R8K] (Scheme 2). The syntheses of fluorescence-labeled phosphopeptide
F′-GpYEEI, F′-d4T, F′-3TC, and F′-FTC
have been previously reported by us,15,22−24 where F′ is 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of F′-[W9R8K]
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay of Peptides
To evaluate
the cytotoxicity of [WR]x (x = 5–9), cell viability assay was employed in normal kidney
LLC-PK1 cell line at the experimental concentration of 25 μM
(Figure 2). Dox
(5 μM) was used as a positive control. The percentage of cell
survival demonstrated that the peptides [WR]5 and [WR]6 did not show any significant toxicity at this concentration,
whereas Dox was cytotoxic even at 5 μM. The cytotoxicity was
gradually increased as the number of tryptophan and arginine increased
in the cyclic peptides. For example, [WR]7 and [WR]8 reduced cell proliferation at 25 μM by 21 and 23%,
respectively, after 24 h incubation. [WR]9 showed significant
toxicity and reduced the cell proliferation at 25 μM by 55%.
[WR]7 and [WR]9 exhibited significantly more
cytotoxicity after 72 h (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Cytotoxicity of cyclic peptides (25 μM) in LLC-PK1
(normal
kidney cells) after 24 and 72 h incubation using MTS assay.

Further studies were required
to find a noncytotoxic concentration
for [WR]9. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of [WR]9, cell viability assay was conducted in LLC-PK1 cell line at the
experimental concentration of 1, 5, and 10 μM. The percentage
of cell survival demonstrated that [WR]9 reduced cell viability
by 19–23% at 24 h at these concentrations, whereas Dox was
cytotoxic at 5 μM reducing the cell viability by 79% (Figure 3). These studies showed that the toxicity of [WR]9 precluded it from being used at a higher concentration and suggested
that this compound could be used alternatively as an anticancer agent
at higher concentrations.

Figure 3 Cytotoxicity of [WR]9 (1, 5, and
10 μM) in LLC-PK1
(normal kidney cells) after 24 and 72 h incubation using MTS assay.

To determine a noncytotoxic concentration
for all of [WR]x (x =
5–9), cell viability
assay was conducted in LLC-PK1 cell line at the experimental concentration
of 10 μM. Dox (5 μM) was used as the positive control.
The percentage of cell survival demonstrated that all the peptides,
including [WR]9, showed less toxicity at this concentration
(10 μM), whereas Dox was significantly cytotoxic even at 5 μM
(Figure 4). Surprisingly,
the peptides were  less cytotoxic after 72 h incubation (Figures 3 and 4).

Figure 4 Cytotoxicity of cyclic peptides (10 μM) in LLC-PK1 (normal
kidney cells) after 24 and 72 h incubation using MTS assay.

After selecting a nontoxic concentration
of peptides, a viability
assay was performed at 10 μM against human leukemia CCRF-CEM
carcinoma cell line after 3 h incubation (Figure 5). [WR]9 showed reduced cell viability
by 23%. The cytotoxicity of peptides was also evaluated at a concentration
of 10 μM against LLC-PK1 after 3 h (Figure 5). [WR]9 reduced the cell viability
by 10%. The data indicate that the peptide was less toxic against
kidney cells at 10 μM concentration after 3 h incubation. Thus,
this concentration was used for performing cellular uptake studies.

Cellular Uptake Studies
Cellular Uptake of A Fluorescence-Labeled
Phosphopeptide in
the Presence of the Peptides
Flow cytometry studies were
performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) using CCRF-CEM
to measure the uptake of fluorescence-labeled phosphopeptide (F′-GpYEEI,
2 μM) in the presence of [WR]5, [WR]6,
[WR]7, [WR]8, and [WR]9 (10 μM).
Cells and fluorescence-labeled phosphopeptide alone were used as negative
controls. After 3 h incubation, CCRF-CEM cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry (Figure 6). [WR]9 (10 μM) significantly enhanced the cellular
uptake of F′-GpYEEI (2 μM) when compared with the other
cyclic peptides. On the basis of the results, the physical mixture
of F′-GpYEEI (2 μM) with [WR]9 (10 μM)
significantly enhanced the cellular uptake by 20-fold when compared
to F′-GpYEEI (2 μM) alone, whereas the physical mixture
of F′-GpYEEI (2 μM) with [WR]5 enhanced the
uptake by 4-fold. On the basis of these data, [WR]9 was
found to be more effective when compared with [WR]5 in
improving the cellular uptake of the phosphopeptide, presumably because
a higher number of positive charges and the larger size of [WR]9 provide adequate interaction and encapsulation of a large
linear negatively charged phosphopeptide in comparison to [WR]5. Thus, cyclic [WR]9 was found to be the most effective
peptide as the molecular transporter of fluorescence-labeled phosphopeptide
among the synthesized peptides. Thus, further studies were performed
with [WR]9.

by [WR]5, [WR]6, [WR]7, [WR]8, and
[WR]9 (10 μM) after 3 h incubation in CCRF-CEM cell
line.

Cellular Uptake Studies
of Fluorescence-Labeled Drugs in the
Presence of [WR]9
Flow cytometry studies were
performed using CCRF-CEM cells to measure the uptake of fluorescence-labeled
phosphopeptide F′-GpYEEI (1 μM) and fluorescence-labeled
anti-HIV drugs, such as F′-d4T (1 μM), F′-3TC
(1 μM), and F′-FTC (1 μM), in the presence of [WR]9 (10 μM). The data were based on the mean fluorescence
signal for 10 000 cells collected (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Intracellular uptake of anti-HIV drugs [F′-FTC
(1 μM),
F′-3TC (1 μM), and F′-d4T (1 μM)] and F′-GpYEEI
(1 μM) with [WR]9 (10 μM) in CCRF-CEM cells
after 3 h incubation.

The physical mixture of F′-3TC (1 μM) and F′-d4T
(1 μM) with [WR]9 (10 μM) significantly enhanced
the cellular uptake of F′-3TC and F′-d4T by 2-fold,
whereas the physical mixture of F′-FTC with [WR]9 enhanced the uptake only by 1.75-fold (Figure 7). The presence of [WR]9 (10 μM)
significantly enhanced the cellular uptake of the phosphopeptide,
F′-GpYEEI (1 μM), by 4-fold, which is less than when
the phosphopeptide was used at a higher concentration (2 μM, Figure 6). These data indicate
that an appropriate ratio of 5 to 1 between [WR]9 and phosphopeptide
is required for more efficient uptake. The presence of [WR]9 also showed enhanced cellular uptake of the anti-HIV drugs but not
as significant as the phosphopeptide and in comparison to [WR]5.13 Thus, we assume that the cyclic
structure in [WR]9 is too large, and residues in the peptide
are far for adequate interaction and encapsulation, to carry small
molecule drugs, such as anti-HIV drugs. However, [WR]9 showed
to be significantly more efficient in the delivery of a larger linear
phosphopeptide in comparison to [WR]5.

Cellular
Uptake of F′-[W9R8K]
To confirm
the cellular uptake of cyclic peptide [WR]9 that contains
alternating arginine and tryptophan residues, a fluorescently
labeled conjugate of the peptide, F′-[W9R8K], was synthesized (Scheme 2), and the cellular internalization was studied. The
synthesis of the fluorescently labeled peptide was accomplished by
replacing one arginine unit with a lysine residue during solid-phase
peptide synthesis and attaching carboxyfluorescein (F′) to
the side chain of lysine in the solution phase. The cellular uptake
of the selected fluorescence-labeled cyclic peptide F′-[W9R8K] was observed by measuring the fluorescence
in the treated cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner
and in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors.

Flow cytometry
studies were performed in CCRF-CEM cells to determine the uptake of
F′-[W9R8K] in different concentrations.
The cells were incubated with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) (1, 5,
and 10 μM) and F′-[W9R8K] (1, 5,
and 10 μM) for 5 min, 30 min, and 1 h and were analyzed by flow
cytometry (Figure 8). While the cellular uptake of FAM did not improve as the concentration
increased, the cellular uptake of F′-[W9R8K] was significantly enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner
with the highest uptake at 10 μM. The cellular uptake of the
peptide was also time-dependent and was at its highest after 1 h.
Thus, the cellular uptake of the fluorescently labeled peptide was
found to be concentration- and time-dependent. F′-[W9R8K] was not significantly cytotoxic at this concentration
(10 μM) and time periods.

Figure 8 Dose- and time-dependent cellular uptake
of FAM (1, 5, 10 μM)
and F′-[W9R8K] (1, 5, 10 μM) in
CCRF cells, after 5 min, 30 min, and 1 h incubation. NT is no treatment.

Mechanistic Studies
To determine whether the cellular
uptake was endocytosis-dependent, the transport of fluorescence-labeled
peptide F′-[W9R8K] (10 μM) was
examined in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors (Figure 9). CCRF-CEM cells were pre-incubated
by various inhibitors, including nystatin chloroquine, chlorpromazine,
methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIA) for 30 min. The cells were then
incubated with F′-[W9R8K] (10 μM)
for 1 h. The uptake of F′-[W9R8K] decreased
in the presence of chloroquine but was significantly reduced in the
presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin, chlorpromazine, EIA, and
nystatin. This suggests that the mechanism of uptake could be dependent
on clathrin-mediated or caveolae-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis.
However, the inhibitors did not block the uptake of cargo completely,
suggesting that other pathways are also involved in the delivery of
F′-[W9R8K].

Figure 9 Cellular uptake of F′-[W9R8K] (10
μM) in CCRF-CEM cells pre-incubated with endocytosis inhibitors
(30 min) after 1 h incubation.

Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) depletion was used
to determine
whether F′-[W9R8K] (10 μM) uptake
is energy-dependent. CCRF-CEM cells were pre-incubated with 0.5% of
75 mM sodium azide in opti-minimum Eagle’s essential medium
(MEM) for 30 min prior to the addition of the compound, followed by
1 h incubation. Although the cellular uptake of F′-[W9R8K] (10 μM) was reduced by 1.8-fold in the presence
of sodium azide, significant intracellular uptake was still observed,
suggesting that the uptake is not significantly reduced by inducing
ATP depletion (Figure 10). Thus, different mechanisms may contribute to the peptide’s
cellular uptake. The cellular uptake of the peptide decreased significantly
by 5.6-fold when incubated at 4 °C (Figure 11), suggesting that the uptake of F′-[W9R8K] is significantly affected by temperature.

uptake of F′-[W9R8K] (10
μM) in CCRF-CEM cells pre-incubated with sodium azide (375 μM)
for 1 h, followed by 1 h incubation.

μM) in CCRF-CEM cells pre-incubated at 4 °C for 30 min
compared with CCRF-CEM cells pre-incubated at 37 °C, followed
by 1 h incubation.

Fluorescence Microscopy
Fluorescence microscopy was
performed using CCRF-CEM cells to monitor the cellular uptake of F′-[W9R8K]. Figure 12 shows intracellular/cellular localization (in the
nucleus and cytoplasm) of F′-[W9R8K]
(10 μM) in CCRF-CEM cells after 3 h incubation at
37 °C. These data indicate that the peptide has a cell permeability
property and could be used in transporting appropriate cargo molecules
across the cellular membrane as described above. However, the exact
localization of the peptide needs further investigation.

microscopy images of F′-[W9R8K] (10 μM) after
3 h incubation in the CCRF-CEM
cells.

Fluorescence microscopy studies
were conducted to demonstrate the
cellular uptake of F′-GpYEEI (2 μM) in the presence and
absence of [WR]9 (10 μM) (Figure 13). F′-GpYEEI alone did not show any
significant uptake. However, there was a significant difference in
the uptake of F′-GpYEEI in the presence of [WR]9. These data confirm that [WR]9 can act as a molecular
transporter of the negatively charged F′-GpYEEI.

uptake of F′-GpYEEI (2 μM) in the presence
and absence of [WR]9 (10 μM) in CCRF-CEM after 3

Conclusions
A
number of cyclic amphipathic peptide-containing arginine and
tryptophan residues, namely [WR]5, [WR]6, [WR]7, [WR]8, and [WR]9 were synthesized
through Fmoc solid-phase chemistry and compared for their efficiency
in improving the cellular uptake of cell-impermeable compounds and
establish a structure–molecular transporter efficiency relationship.
The synthesized peptides were found not to be significantly toxic
to normal kidney cell line (LLC-PK1) at 10 μM after 3 h incubation
when compared with CCRF-CEM cell lines. Among all the synthesized
peptides, [WR]9 (10 μM) significantly improved the
uptake of F′-GpYEEI by approximately 20-fold as compared to
[WR]5 which showed 4-fold uptake. The cellular uptake of
fluorescently labeled conjugate F′-[W9R8K] was found to be time- and concentration-dependent. The cellular
uptake of fluorescence-labeled conjugates, F′-FTC, F′-3TC,
and F′-d4T, was slightly increased in CCRF-CEM cells, in the
presence of [WR]9 as compared to the drugs alone. However,
[WR]9 showed to be the most efficient in improving the
uptake of the phosphopeptide. The presence of different endocytosis
inhibitors reduced the cellular uptake of F′-[W9R8K] in CCRF-CEM cells. However, these inhibitors did
not completely block the uptake. Therefore, we can conclude the uptake
of this peptide is not completely dependent on endocytosis and other
mechanisms of entry are possible. Intracellular cellular localization
(in the nucleus and cytoplasm) of F′-[W9R8K] after 3 h incubation at 37 °C was confirmed by fluorescence
microscopy in CCRF-CEM. These data suggest that increasing the number
of alternating positively charged arginine residues and hydrophobic
tryptophan residues in a cyclic peptide was an optimal approach for
generating compounds with efficient molecular transporter properties
for large molecules, such as a negatively charged phosphopeptide.
The work advances the scientific knowledge in the area of cyclic peptide-based
delivery systems for improving the cellular uptake of cell-impermeable
compounds.

(FTC), 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine
(d4T), and fluorescence-labeled lamivudine (3TC)] were prepared and
characterized according to the previously reported procedures.15,22−24 Human leukemia carcinoma cell line (CCRF-CEM, ATCC

were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Methods
General
Cyclic Peptide Synthesis
Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH and
Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH were used as building block amino acids in the peptide
synthesis. First, the linear protected peptides (W(Boc)R(Pbf))5, (W(Boc)R(Pbf))6, (W(Boc)R(Pbf))7,
(W(Boc)R(Pbf))8, and (W(Boc)R(Pbf))9 were synthesized
on H-Trp(Boc)-2-chlorotrityl resin in 0.30 mmol scale. The NH2-Trp(Boc)-2-chlorotrityl resin was swelled in DMF under dry
nitrogen for 30 min. The solvent was filtered. The Fmoc-protected
amino acid was coupled to the N-terminal in the presence
of 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (3 equiv), DIPEA (6 equiv), and DMF mixing for
1 h under nitrogen gas. The reaction solution was filtered after the
coupling reaction completed. The resin was washed with 15 mL of DMF
for 5 min twice. Fmoc deprotection was performed using piperidine
in DMF (20% v/v, 2 × 15 min). The reaction solution was filtered
off, and the resin was washed with DMF (2 × 5 min). The followed
amino acids were coupled using the same protocol to assemble the complete
linear protected peptide on trityl resin. The N-terminal
Fmoc group was deprotected on the final amino acid using piperidine
in DMF (20% v/v, 2 × 15 min). The resin was washed with DMF (2
× 5 min) and methanol (15 mL, 5 min) and dried. The partially
protected peptides were cleaved from the resin support after agitating
the peptidyl resin with freshly prepared cleavage cocktail, DCM/TFE/AcOH
(35 mL:10 mL:5 mL), for 3 h. The solvents were evaporated under vacuum
using low pressure after mixing with hexane (2 × 20 mL) and DCM
(2 ×15 mL) to remove the AcOH by forming an azeotropic mixture.
The crude material was obtained as a white solid.

MALDI analysis
was used to confirm the molecular weight of the linear peptides after
small cleavage of the peptide from the resin. The protected linear
peptides (0.3 mmol) were cyclized in the presence of anhydrous DMF
(100 mL), anhydrous DCM (25 mL), DIC (1.21 mmol, 188 μL), HOAt
(0.9 mmol, 122.5 mg), and DIPEA. The cyclization reaction occurred
overnight under inert condition using nitrogen. MALDI analysis was
used to monitor the completion of cyclization by checking the molecular
weight of the cyclized peptide. The solvents were removed under low
pressure. A freshly prepared cleavage cocktail, trifluoroacetic acid,
anisole, thioanisole, and 1,2-ethanedithiol (6300 μL:350 μL:210
μl:140 μL), was added to the mixture and stirred for 3
h. The cold diethyl ether was added to precipitate the crude peptide
and was centrifuged to obtain solid peptide. MALDI analysis confirmed
the molecular weight of the cyclic peptides without any protecting
groups. All the peptides were purified using reversed-phase HPLC and
lyophilized.

A fluorescence-labeled derivative of the selected
cyclic peptide
[WR]9 was synthesized as F′-[W9R8K], according to the solid-phase synthesis strategy described
above. The N-terminal arginine was replaced with
a lysine amino acid to facilitate labeling with carboxyfluorescein
(F′). After the synthesis and purification of the peptide [W9R8K], the lyophilized powder of [W9R8K] peptide (4.5 mg, 1.47 μmol) and FAMNHS (2.0 mg, 4,2μmol)
was coupled using DIPEA (5.12 μL, 29.4 μmol) in anhydrous
DMF (1 mL). The coupling reaction was completed overnight. The purification
was conducted according to the described general method above used
for other cyclic peptides to yield F′-[W9R8K] (Scheme 2). The

In Vitro
Cytotoxicity Assay of Peptides
The in vitro
cytotoxicity of the peptides was evaluated using human leukemia carcinoma
cell line (CCRF-CEM, ATCC no. CCL-119) and normal kidney cell line
(LLC-PK1, ATCC no. CRL-1392) to determine the viability of the peptides
according to the previously reported procedure.10 CCRF-CEM cells were seeded at 50 000 cells in 0.1
mL per well in 96-well plates. LLC-PK1 cells were seeded at 5000 cells
in 0.1 mL per well in 96-well plates. Both cell lines were seeded
in medium RPMI-1640 containing fetal bovine serum (10%), 24 h prior
to the experiment as per manufacture protocol.9 The compounds were added to each well in triplicates at a concentration
of 10 μM and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. The compounds were tested at different
concentrations (1–50 μM) and were added to each well
in triplicate and incubated for 3, 24, and 72 h at 37 °C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell viability was then
determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 490 nm using
a SpectraMax M2 microplate spectrophotometer. The percentage of cell
survival was calculated as [(optical density (OD) value of cells treated
with the test mixture of compounds) – (OD value of culture
medium)]/[(OD value of control cells) – (OD value of culture
medium)] × 100%.

Cellular Uptake Studies
CCRF-CEM
cells were used to
measure the cellular uptake of the F′-GpYEEI, fluorescence-labeled
3TC (F′-3TC), fluorescence-labeled d4T (F′-d4T), and
fluorescence-labeled FTC (F′-FTC). FACS analysis was performed
in order to measure the intracellular uptake of the cargo and determine
whether the presence of the peptide affects the uptake of F′-GpYEEI,
F′-3TC, F′-d4T, and F′-FTC. The fluorescence
intensity was measured in the presence and absence of the synthesized
peptides. The cells (5 × 105 cells per well) were
taken in 6-well plates in opti-MEM or serum-free RPMI medium. F′-GpYEEI,
F′-3TC, F′-d4T, and F′-FTC at 2 μM were
then added to the wells containing the synthesized peptides [WR]x (x = 5–9) at 10
μM for 3 h of incubation at 37 °C cells. F′-GpYEEI,
F′-3TC, F′-d4T, and F′-FTC alone (2 μM)
were used as negative controls. After 3 h, CCRF-CEM cells were centrifuged
at 800 rpm, and the cells were collected as precipitant. The cells
were then washed with PBS two times. Finally, the cells were resuspended
in flow cytometry buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur:
Becton Dickinson) using FITC channel and CellQuest software. The data
presented were based on the mean fluorescence signal for 10 000
cells collected. All assays were performed in triplicates. FACS analysis
was performed to measure the fluorescence intensity intracellularly
and to determine whether the cyclic peptides were facilitating the
cargos to cross the membrane.

A similar study was performed
by FACS using CCRF-CEM cells with F′-3TC, F′-d4T, and
F′-FTC at 5 μM with 3 h incubation in the presence and
absence of the synthesized peptides. The cells (5 × 105 cells per well) were incubated with the synthesized peptides (at
10 μM) for 3 h.

Mechanistic studies werecarried out in
the presence of endocytosis
inhibitors, such as nystatin, chlorpromazine, chloroquine, and methyl
β-cyclodextrin, to determine whether the uptake was endocytosis-dependent.
CCRF-CEM cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) in opti-MEM. The cells were pre-incubated by various
inhibitors including nystatin (50 μg/mL), chloroquine (100 μM),
chlorpromazine (30 μM), methyl-β-cyclodextrin (2.5 mM),
and EIA (50 μM) for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with
F′-[W9R8K] (10 μM) and a similar
concentration of inhibitors for 1 h. To induce ATP depletion, the
cells were pre-incubated with 0.5% of 150 mM sodium azide in opti-MEM
prior to the addition of the compound followed by 1 h incubation.
FACS was performed as previously described.

Fluorescence Microscopy
CCRF-CEM cells (30 μL
of 3 ×106) were seeded with EMEM media overnight on
a glass-bottom culture dish. The cells were treated with F′-[W9R8K] (10 μM) or [WR]9 (10 μM)
+ F′-GpYEEI (2 μM) in opti-MEM and incubated for 3 h
at 37 °C. After 3 h incubation, cells were centrifuged at 800
rpm for 5 min. The cells were then washed with 400 μL of PBS
and centrifuged again. The media was then added to the cells. The
cells were then placed on the cover slip and were detected by using
a Keyence fluorescence microscope (BZ-X700. Keyence Corp. of America,
Itasca, IL).
