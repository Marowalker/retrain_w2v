An empirical conversion
method (ECM) that transforms
pKa values of arbitrary organic
compounds from one solvent to the other is introduced. We demonstrate
the method’s usefulness and performance on pKa conversions involving water and organic solvents acetonitrile
(MeCN), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and methanol (MeOH).
We focus on the pKa conversion from the
known reference value in water to the other three organic solvents,
although such a conversion can also be performed between any pair
of the considered solvents. The ECM works with an additive parameter
that is specific to a solvent and a molecular family (essentially
characterized by a functional group that is titrated). We formally
show that the method can be formulated with a single additive parameter,
and that the extra multiplicative parameter used in other works is
not required. The values of the additive parameter are determined
from known pKa data, and their interpretation
is provided on the basis of physicochemical concepts. The data set
of known pKa values is augmented with
pKa values computed with the recently
introduced electrostatic transform method, whose validity is demonstrated.
For a validation of our method, we consider pKa conversions for two data sets of titratable compounds. The
first data set involves 81 relatively small molecules belonging to
19 different molecular families, with the pKa data available in all four considered solvents. The second
data set involves 76 titratable molecules from 5 additional molecular
families. These molecules are typically larger, and their experimental
pKa values are available only in Me2SO and water. The validation tests show that the agreement
between the experimental pKa data and
the ECM predictions is generally good, with absolute errors often
on the order of 0.5 pH units. The presence of a few outliers is rationalized,
and observed trends with respect to molecular families are discussed.

Introduction
The acid dissociation
constant Ka measures the strength of an
acid in a solution. It is a key
quantity for the functionality of molecules with variable protonation.
For practical purposes, one uses the negative decadic logarithm of Ka, also known as pKa. The determination of this quantity, performed in different protic
and aprotic solvents, is particularly important for both applied and
fundamental physicochemical sciences.1−3

The pKa value also plays a central
role in drug discovery. This value influences solubility, membrane
permeability, clearance, and binding of a drug molecule to the target
protein.4−9 About two-third of the approved pharmaceutical compounds contain
ionizable groups, usually in the pH range between 3 and 11 with a
maximum at 8.5.5 Before a drug can exercise
its function in the living cell environment, it has to penetrate the
cytoplasmic membrane, which is structurally composed of a lipid bilayer.
The inside of such cell membranes is much less polar than water. Charged
compounds are generally better soluble in water than in apolar solvents,
whereas charge-neutral compounds are better soluble in apolar solvents.
The lipophilicity is maximized for a protonation form with zero charge,6 and therefore it is this form of a molecule that
can penetrate the membrane most efficiently.

The pKa value of a drug is important
for passive renal tubular reabsorption.10−12 Many drugs are either
weak acids or bases. Their clearance and absorption behavior depends
on urine pH that can vary from 4.5 to 8.0. Whereas weakly acidic drugs
are reabsorbed from acidic urine, weakly basic drugs tend to be reinternalized
in basic urine. Hence, by knowing the pKa of the drug molecule, one can more effectively predict the clearance
and its tubular reabsorption process as a function of pH. For all
these reasons, the design of successful drug compounds could greatly
benefit from a fast and accurate methodology to predict the pKa of a molecule in apolar nonaqueous solvents.

There are different approaches for computing or predicting the
pKa values ranging from empirical methods
to ab initio methods. The latter employ quantum chemistry usually
combined with electrostatics and occasionally also with molecular
dynamics (MD). A recent work on proton solvation in different solvents13 provides an overview of such pKa computations for organic compounds. The empirical methods,
on the other hand, relate their pKa to
specific features of titratable molecules like molecular structure,
semiempirical molecular orbital theory, atomic charges, philicity,
and others.14−22

It is demonstrated that converting the computed pKa values of a set of 34 titratable compounds among the
organic solvents acetonitrile (MeCN), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and tetrahydrofuran can be essentially performed with an additive
shift parameter that depends only on the two solvents but not on the
nature of the molecules.23 For dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), it is demonstrated that the computed pKa values agree very well with the measured values such
that this conversion should be also valid among experimental pKa values. These results suggest that for the
mentioned organic solvents, only a solvent specific shift parameter
is necessary, and that specific solute–solvent interactions
have no influence on the pKa values. In
an earlier work,24 the experimental pKa values in water and methanol are compared
for a much larger set of molecules. It is found that essentially an
additive shift parameter is necessary for converting the pKa values between the two solvents. However,
it is necessary to use different values of the shift parameter for
different groups of molecules. This may be partly due to the much
larger set of considered molecules but also due the involvement of
water, which has a stronger interaction with charged solutes.

Here, we introduce a fully empirical approach that converts the
pKa values known in aqueous solution to
pKa values of the same compound in other
solvents. A key feature of our approach is the assignment of a titratable
molecule to a specific family of titratable molecular groups. The
molecular families of compounds follow the categorization scheme defined
in ref (25). These
families are selected according to the degree of homogeneity among
the chemical functional groups characterizing their components, which
can influence the pKa values of their
titratable groups. To convert a pKa value
between two solvents, one needs a single additive shift parameter
for each molecular family and pair of solvents. Such families of titratable
molecular groups are previously used in the context of empirical prediction
of pKa values in aqueous solvent,25,26 and family-specific linear functions serve for interconversion between
the estimated pKa values.

Solvent
molecules can either possess or not possess polar hydrogen
atoms, and the corresponding solvents are called protic or aprotic,
respectively. One of the most typical protic solvents is water, which
involves only polar hydrogens. Acetonitrile (MeCN) and dimethyl sulfoxide
(Me2SO) constitute typical aprotic solvents. These are
pharmacologically relevant solvents because they are of lower polarity
and can therefore mimic the interior of the membranes, which need
to be penetrated by drug molecules to reach their targets. On the
other hand, methanol (MeOH) possesses both polar and nonpolar hydrogens
and is therefore a solvent that is neither protic nor aprotic. Products
of methanol oxidation are toxic in living cells. However, methanol
can be considered as a model system that mimics the situation in a
living cell consisting of a mixture of water with a high concentration
of proteins and organic molecules that are neither protic nor aprotic.

In the present study, we consider two data sets. The first data
set focuses on titratable compounds of small size, for which measured
pKa values are known in water and preferentially
also in several of the considered three organic solvents. This data
set is provided in Tables S1–S7 in
the Supporting Information. It comprises 81 titratable compounds assigned
to 19 different families (Figure 1). The 81 chosen titratable compounds are typical members
of their molecular families. For this data set, 87 measured pKa values are available in the three considered
organic solvents. In 107 cases, where no measured pKa values are available for some organic solvents, we compute
them by the electrostatic transform method (ETM) using the measured
pKa values in other solvents.27 To demonstrate the validity of the ETM, the
pKa values are computed in 35 cases and
compared with the known measured pKa values,
yielding a root mean square deviation pKa value (pKa-RMSD) of 0.77 pH units.

Figure 1 First
data set of titratable molecules involves 81 molecules in
nineteen different molecular families (A–S). The detailed data
are listed in Tables S1–S7 of the
Supporting Information. The number of molecules of a specific family
is given after the one-letter family name. The molecules are displayed
in the protonated state with titratable protons in green color, whereas
the other polar hydrogens are displayed in black. For the families
O and P only one resonance structure is shown, but, all displayed
hydrogen atoms are equivalent and titratable. Nonpolar hydrogens are
not displayed. For the families R and S protonation of the carbon
atom C2 and C3, respectively, converts the double bond between the
two carbon atoms to a single bond. As a consequence the excess positive
charge is localizes at the carbon atom, which is not protonated. The
formal charge localized at the titratable hydrogen is denoted as a
superscript. Oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are highlighted in
red, blue, and yellow color, respectively.

We also provide the pKa values
in water
obtained with the Jaguar pKa prediction
method (JPM),28,29 which is based on the work of
Friesner et al.25 JPM assembles a reference
pKa value from gas phase and solution
phase energies of protonated and deprotonated species, using the density
functional theory B3LYP as implemented in Jaguar. The predicted pKa value is obtained from the reference pKa value with a linear regression scheme involving
adjustable parameters for different molecular families. In the present
work, the pKa values in water obtained
with the JPM are used as reference values for converting them to the
pKa values in the other solvents. The
JPM predictions serve as a substitute for measured pKa values in water because the pKa values of the JPM are readily available for practically all
different types of titratable molecules. The parameters of the presently
proposed empirical conversion method (ECM) are determined by matching
the pKa values with 87 measured and 107
pKa values computed with the electrostatic
transform method (ETM). The quality of the ECM is evaluated by comparing
the measured pKa values and those computed
with ETM, with the corresponding ones obtained through ECM.

The second data set involves 76 titratable compounds belonging
to 5 different additional molecular families. These molecules are
generally of larger size. Here, the measured pKa values are mainly available in DMSO only. The corresponding
pKa values in DMSO are predicted with
Jaguar whenever possible. The measured pKa values in DMSO are used to compute the pKa values in water through ETM. Subsequently, the measured and ETM
pKa values are used to establish the ECM
for the five molecular families. The same operation is performed employing
the measured pKa values in DMSO and the
pKa values in water obtained with the
JPM.26 Here, the quality of the ECM is
evaluated by comparing the ECM pKa values
in water with the corresponding ETM and JPM pKa values.

Methods
Basic Theory of pKa Computation
Through the years, many
different approaches have been developed
for computing or predicting the pKa value
of a molecule in different solvents. Among these methods, there is
a popular strategy based on the exploitation of a thermodynamic cycle
that describes the process of proton dissociation.30−33 In such a cycle, gas and solvent
phases are considered. The gas-phase free energy of deprotonation
(i.e., the proton affinity) is computed as 1  where Ggas(M)
is the gas-phase free energy of molecular species M. The gas-phase
free energy of the proton in the standard state T = 298.15 K and 1 mol/L is given as34,35 2  The difference
in solvation free energies
of the deprotonated (A– + H+) and protonated
(AH) molecular species given by 3  describes the influence of the solvent
environment
on the energetics of the protonation process. If the nonelectrostatic
part of the binding free energy of a proton to a solute molecule does
not depend on the particular solvent environment, which is often the
case, the energetics of a protonation process in a solvent environment
can be described as the sum of free energy differences in the gas-phase
and solvent yielding with eqs 1 and 3 4  According to a thermodynamic
relation, the
resulting free energy difference can be used to evaluate the pKa value31−33 5  

Empirical
pKa Conversion Method
(ECM)
We seek a simple molecular family specific function gf, with parameters to be optimized, that converts
the pKa value of a compound Yf belonging to family f from solvent j (which, in the present case, is water) to one of the three
considered organic solvents i 6  This problem is related to the electrostatic
transform method (ETM), which was recently introduced.27 With the ETM, the measured or computed pKa value of a titratable compound Y can be transformed from one solvent (j) to another
(i) using only contributions from solvation energies
of the two considered solvents according to the following relation 7  The terms ΔGsolv(Y) = Gsolv(Y–) – Gsolv(YH)
in eq 7 are the electrostatically
computed differences of solvation
free energies (deprotonated minus protonated) of compound Y and Gsolv(U+, i) together with Gsolv(H+, j) are the free energies of proton solvation
of the two solvents (i and j). In
the following text, the energy differences ΔGsolv(Y, i) –
ΔGsolv(Y, j) are tabulated in pH units.

In the ETM methodology,27 atomic partial charges of a molecule are determined
by matching the electrostatic potential generated by the electronic
wave function and the nuclear charges with the electrostatic potential
from atomic point charges using the restrained electrostatic potential
procedure.36,37 The electronic wave function
of the geometry optimized molecule is computed with the B3LYP functional
in combination with the double-ζ basis set 6-31G. Finally, the
electrostatic solvation energies of the protonated and deprotonated
molecular species are computed by solving the Poisson equation with
the program SOLVATE, from the program suit MEAD.38,39

The ETM works properly under the following three conditions:
(1)
variations in the molecular conformations in the environment that
can be either a liquid or even the gas phase do no influence the pKa value or do not even occur. (2) The charge
pattern of protonated and deprotonated molecular species does not
depend on the environment, i.e., the charge distribution is the same
in the gas phase and different solvents. (3) The nonelectrostatic
part of the energy difference between protonated and deprotonated
molecular species does not depend on the environment, i.e., it is
the same in gas phase or different solvents. Under these conditions,
the ETM procedure has been proven to work with an accuracy of 0.7
pH units when applied to transform pKa values of compounds between water, MeCN, Me2SO, and MeOH.27 However, it should be noted that these conditions
might not be satisfied for some titratable compounds considered in
the present study.

The strategy to transform pKa values
from one environment to another is also performed for titratable residues
in proteins.40−50 In this case, the pKa values are transformed
from aqueous solution to the corresponding protein environment, which
is represented by the atomic point charges embedded in a low dielectric
medium. The accuracy of the computed pKa values in proteins is typically in the range of 1 pH unit or above,
where one critical source of error is the uncertainty in the atomic
coordinates of the protein model. This is particularly the case if
the protein model is solely based on the crystal structures. Alternating
the protein crystal structures by modeling51,52 or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations53 helps reduce the pKa-RMSD, which for
MD simulations is significantly below 1 pH unit.

Empirical schemes
have already been used for converting measured
pKa values between different solvents.
They were applied to a set of phenols (Ph) using multiplicative (A = 1.68) and additive (B = 9.80) parameters54 converting the pKa values from water (WAT) to acetonitrile (ACN) according to 8  A linear
transformation is also used to convert
approximately computed pKa values for
water25,29,55−57 and acetonitrile40 into pKa values comparable to experiment. Thereby, the parameter A compensates mainly for deficiencies of the quantum chemically
computed energies and the electrostatic solvation energies, whereas
the additive parameter B accounts mainly for the
lack or insufficient accuracy of vibrational energies, entropy, and
proton solvation energy.27

The ETM
and its eq 7(27) demonstrates that no multiplicative
factor like A in eq 8 is necessary to convert pKa values between different solvents, if the pKa value of the reference solvent is precise. In other work,
it is demonstrated that the pKa values
can be converted between different organic solvents with eq 8 with a multiplicative factor A close to unity.23,24 Therefore, we advocate
the use of the simplified linear function 9  to convert the pKa value of a compound Yf belonging to the molecular family f from
the solvent j to the solvent i.
Test computations show
no detectable improvement if the more general linear function, eq 8, was used.

The validity
of the electrostatic transform method (ETM) requires
that the molecular conformation and the atomic partial charges be
the same in gas phase and solutions. In contrast, the empirical conversion
method (ECM), eq 9, is
more general and can account for such dependencies as well as for
solvent-dependent shifts in the electronic energies, if they are the
same for the considered molecular family. The accuracy of the ECM
depends on the appropriate choice of the molecular families and can
be improved by using more molecular families.

Results and Discussion
First
Data Set of Titratable Molecules
Let us begin
with an application of our method to the first data set of titratable
molecules, shown in Figure 1. Our empirical conversion method (ECM) will be used to transform
the pKa values from water to three organic
solvents: acetonitrile (MeCN), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO),
and methanol (MeOH). As reference pKa values
in water, we use the pKa values computed
with the Jaguar pKa prediction method
(JPM), alternatively referred to as simply Jaguar. The pKa values computed with Jaguar apply a semiempirical scheme
where an approximate “raw” pKa value is converted by a linear function with adjustable parameters
that depend on a molecular family. These reference pKa values are used to optimize the parameters ΔpKaf of eq 9. For comparison, we also provide
the corresponding experimental pKa values
in water. The deviation between the measured pKa values in water and those predicted by Jaguar varies for
the 19 different molecular families of the first data set, but is
on the average less than 0.5 pH units for the considered titratable
molecules. However, for some families in some solvents, it can be
larger. Detailed data are given in Tables S1–S7 of the Supporting Information.

In this study, the ECM, eq 9, is established for 81
titratable compounds of the first data set represented by the nineteen
different molecular families from Figure 1. The additive parameters ΔpKaf are optimized
by fitting the pKa values of the ECM to
the measured benchmark pKa values for
the three organic solvents using the predicted JPM pKa values in water as a basis. For pure Me2SO,
the measured pKa values are available
for many organic compounds (37 for the considered set of titratable
compounds).58 However, there are fewer
measured pKa values available for the
pure solvents of MeCN (23 for the considered set of titratable compounds)
and MeOH (27 for the considered set of titratable compounds). In the
two latter solvents, the pKa measurements
are often performed in mixtures with water. However, the pKa values measured in mixtures with water may
be biased by water molecules clustering around the polar atoms of
the titratable groups. Hence, such measurements are not considered
for the set of benchmark pKa values.

For seven molecular families [barbituric acids (F), imides (H),
amidines (O), guanidines (P), benzodiazepines (Q), pyrroles C (R),
and indoles C (S)], the measured pKa values
are not available in any of the three considered organic solvents.
Therefore, to enlarge the database of benchmark pKa values for the first data set and obtain a more representative
set of known pKa values for the three
organic solvents, the ETM27 is applied.
The accuracy of this method is generally high and allows optimizing
the parameters on a larger set of benchmark pKa values to convert the pKa values
between the three organic solvents. However, the ETM has a limited
range of applicability, as discussed above. Therefore, we apply it
to small molecules, where the gas-phase geometry is the same as in
solutions. We also make sure that the computed atomic partial charges
determined in vacuum are appropriate for the solution phase.

In Figure 2, the
ECM pKa values are plotted versus the
measured values. The pKa-RMSD values are
0.60, 0.67, 0.41 pH units for 20 (excluding 3 outliers), 37, and 27
measured pKa values in acetonitrile, dimethyl
sulfoxide, and methanol, respectively. In Figure 3, the ECM pKa values are displayed versus the pKa values
computed with the ETM27 that uses the measured
pKa values in water for the transformation
to the other solvents. In this case, the pKa-RMSD values are 0.62, 0.53, 0.54 pH units for 38, 32, 37 transformed
pKa values in acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide,
and methanol, respectively. Hence, the pKa-RMSD values between empirically converted pKa values and pKa values obtained
with the ETM are nearly as small as the pKa-RMSD values between empirically converted and experimental pKa values, which demonstrates the quality of
the pKa values obtained with ECM.

for MeCN are denoted by black crosses (+). The numerical values of
the pKa are listed in Tables S1–S7 of the Supporting Information. The left

The numerical values of the pKa are listed
in Tables S1–S7 of the Supporting
Information. The left part of the figure displays all of the data.
The right part is a close-up that focuses on the center pH interval.

The values of the empirical pKa shift
parameters ΔpKaf that appear in eq 9 are listed in Table 1 for the nineteen considered molecular families. They describe the
family (f) specific shifts of the pKa values in water to obtain the pKa values in the other three organic solvents. For MeCN the
shift parameters of the pKa values (ΔpKaf) are systematically
larger by about 8 pH units compared to the corresponding values for
Me2SO. This is due to the difference in proton solvation
energies relative to the value in water. The proton solvation energies
are −255.1, −266.4, and −265.9 kcal/mol for MeCN,
Me2SO, and MeOH, respectively.13 They correlate with the pKa values that
these solvent molecules have in aqueous solution.13 In water the corresponding proton solvation energy determined
by matching computed and measured pKa values
for a suitable set of titratable organic molecules is −266.3
kcal/mol.13 This value is slightly lower
than the consensus value of −265.9 kcal/mol.59,60 The differences of the proton solvation energies relative to the
value in water are 11.2, −0.1, and 0.4 kcal/mol for MeCN, Me2SO, and MeOH, respectively. Converting these energy values
into pH units by means of eq 5, we obtain at T = 298 K the values 8.22,
−0.07, and 0.29 for MeCN, Me2SO, and MeOH, respectively.
These values where subtracted from the pKa shift parameter ΔpKaf yielding the values in the last three columns of Table 1. They show the contributions
to the pKa shift parameter [ΔpKa] relative to water, which are due to the solvation
energy differences of the deprotonated and protonated molecular species.
According to eq 7, the
solvation energy difference corresponding to the pKa shift between water and another solvent (solv) is given
by 10  The corresponding contribution to
the pKa shift relative to water without
the contribution
from proton solvation is 11  The nineteen molecular families of the first
data set, Figure 1,
can be split into two groups. The molecules of the first group (A–I)
possess a neutrally charged titratable group in the protonated state
with a single proton attached to oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen atoms.
The molecules of the second group (J–Q) possess a positively
charged titratable group in the protonated state with a proton attached
to nitrogen or an additional proton attached to carbon.

a The first column denotes the family
by single letter code and gives the number of compounds considered
for this family. The first three columns with numbers list the shift
of pKa values (ΔpKa) in MeCN, Me2SO, and MeOH relative to the
values in water. In the last three columns, the contributions from
the proton solvation energies (in pH units: 8.22, −0.07, and
0.29 for MeCN, Me2SO, and MeOH, respectively) were subtracted
from ΔpKa yielding [ΔpKa], eq 11. The last two lines contain the pKa shift parameters, if only two groups of families are considered
as described in text.

b No
experimental pKa values are available
in MeCN and MeOH and the electrostatic
transform method (ETM) fails to yield proper values.

For the first group of nine molecular
families (A–I), the
values of solvation energy differences ΔΔGsolv(A–/AH) [defined by eq 10] and consequently also [ΔpKa] (defined by eq 11 and listed in Table 1) are significantly positive. This indicates
that deprotonation in one of the three considered organic solvents
is energetically less favorable than in water. This is due to the
fact that in the negatively charged deprotonated state, the molecules
are better solvated in the protic solvent water than in the aprotic
solvents acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfoxide. Because methanol is
neither protic nor aprotic, the corresponding values of [ΔpKa] are less positive for methanol.

the other ten molecular families (J–S) belonging to
the second group of families, the [ΔpKa] values are generally close to zero, yielding shift parameters
ΔpKa that depend mainly on the proton
solvation energy. These molecular families have two common features.
(i) In the protonated state, they have a positively charged titratable
group. (ii) The titratable atom is either nitrogen or carbon to which
several hydrogen atoms are attached (except for tertiary amines, family
K), and so they possess generally less polar titratable groups than
the molecules of the first group of molecular families. Therefore,
the solvation energies of these molecules differ less between protic
and aprotic solvents than for molecules belonging to the first group.

Simplified pKa Prediction Model
that Ignores Detailed Molecular Family Dependencies
In contrast
to the pKa prediction model that requires
the use of nineteen molecular families for applying the electrostatic
conversion method (ECM) to the first data set, a very approximate
scheme may use just two different sets of molecular families. However,
one cannot dispense with the dependence on the solvent because the
pKa shift parameters [ΔpKa] are systematically larger for MeCN than for
Me2SO and MeOH. The first set involves the families B to
I, where the pKa shift parameters are
generally large (Table 1). What is common about these titratable compounds is that their
titratable group is charge neutral in the protonated state. The family
of alcohols (A) is excluded because for them, the necessary ΔpKa values (albeit available only for Me2SO) are considerably larger than for other compounds. This difference
may correlate with the fact that the ETM fails to provide proper pKa values for this family. A reason for this
failure could be solvent-specific interactions that are not included
in an electrostatic continuum model of the solvent. The second set
comprises the molecular families J–S (Table 1). Here, the pKa shift parameters [ΔpKa] are small
for all three organic solvents. These compounds are similar in that
their titratable group is positively charged in the protonated state
and involves a nitrogen or carbon atom to which several hydrogen atoms
are attached in the protonated state. The corresponding values of
the pKa shift parameters are listed in
the last two lines of Table 1. The overall pKa-RMSDs for all
three considered organic solvents are 1.37 and 0.96 for the first
and second set of molecular families, respectively, which is reasonably
small to serve as a rough approximation.

Second Data Set of Titratable
Molecules
The second
data set involves 76 titratable molecules from 5 specific families
(Figure 4). It is of
high interest to know the pKa values of
these compounds in water. Unfortunately, experimental pKa values for this data set are scarce and practically
only available for DMSO. The majority of these molecules are of larger
size and are more flexible than the molecules from the first data
set. Therefore, the pKa values computed
with the electrostatic transform method (ETM) are not necessarily
as reliable as for the first data set. But the ETM is nevertheless
a practical tool to obtain estimates of the pKa values in water. In addition to ETM, the Jaguar prediction
scheme is also applied for obtaining the pKa values in water. Both sets of pKa values
in water are used to establish alternative ECM for the pKa values in water. For two families (cyano- and keto-compounds),
the Jaguar prediction scheme is applicable in DMSO. A comparison of
these predicted pKa values with the measured pKa values yielded pKa-RMSD of 1.32
and 1.85 pH units for the families of cyano- and keto-compounds, respectively.
However, it should be noted that the Jaguar prediction scheme for
DMSO is still in preliminary stage of development and needs to be
improved. Detailed data are listed in Tables S8–S12 of the Supporting Information. The correlation diagram between ECM
(converted) and ETM (transformed) pKa values
is shown in Figure 5 for all five molecular families of the second data set. If the outliers
are discarded, then the pKa-RMSDs differ
by less than 0.8 pH units.

Figure 4 The second data set of titratable molecules
involves 76 molecules
in 5 different molecular families displayed in the protonated state.
The detailed data are listed in Tables S8–S12 of the Supporting Information. The number of molecules of a specific
family is given before the family name. Titratable hydrogens carry
the formal charge zero for all five families and are shown in green.
Oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are highlighted in red, blue, and
yellow, respectively.

Figure 5 Correlation diagram for the empirical conversion method (ECM).
ECM (converted) pKa values are plotted
versus the electrostatic transform method (ETM)27 computed pKa values for the
second data set. The latter are based on measured pKa values in DMSO. The ECM pKa values are evaluated according to eq 9 using preliminary pKa values
in DMSO obtained with the Jaguar pKa prediction
method (JPM)28,29 as the basis. The number of compounds
for the individual molecular families is given in the rectangular
brackets. Outliers where the pKa values
differ by more than 1.5 pH units are denoted with “+”.
The numerical values of the pKa are listed
in Tables S8–S12 of the Supporting
Information.

The titratable groups
in the molecules of the second data set carry
for all five molecular families zero formal charge (Figure 4). For the molecular families
squaramides, thiourea, and BINOL, the titratable hydrogen is attached
to nitrogen or oxygen. These molecular families are therefore analogous
to the families A–I of the first data set (Figure 1), where the values of [ΔpKa], eq 11, are significantly larger than zero. Because the proton solvation
energy is nearly the same for water and DMSO, the shift parameters
ΔpKa involving also proton solvation
are nearly equal to the shift parameters [ΔpKa] without proton solvation. Hence, for the same reason
as described before, we expect significantly positive values of the
shift parameters, ΔpKa. This is
indeed the case (see Table 2).

a The first column gives the number
of compounds considered for the corresponding molecular family. The
last two columns contain the values of the pKa shift parameter ΔpKa. They
convert the pKa values from water to Me2SO according to eq 9. In this application, the shift parameters are determined
by converting the measured pKa values
in Me2SO to the corresponding values in water. The third
column contains the values of ΔpKa obtained by using the pKa values in
water that were computed with the electrostatic transform method (ETM),
whereas in the last column ΔpKa are
obtained using the pKa values in water
computed with the Jaguar pKa prediction
method (JPM).

The other
two molecular families of cyano- and keto-compounds have
the titratable hydrogen attached to carbon atom. They should therefore
be analogous to the molecular families R and S of the first data set,
where the [ΔpKa] parameters are
close to zero. But, for the cyano- and keto-compounds, the pKa shift parameter ΔpKa adopts values above 6 pH units. Hence, the deprotonated
cyano- and keto-compounds must be much more polar than the deprotonated
indoles and pyrroles (molecular families R and S). In the latter case,
the carbon atoms are part of an aromatic ring system, which may be
responsible for lower polarity of the deprotonated state of these
compounds. However, another difference is the formal charge of the
titratable group in the protonated state. This charge is positive
for the molecular families R and S of the first data set, but neutral
for the cyano- and keto-compounds of the second data set, which is
in analogy to the molecular families A–I of the first data
set. Therefore, the cyano- and keto-compounds are indeed more polar
in the deprotonated state than the deprotonated pyrroles and indoles
of the molecular families R and S, which explains the large values
of the pKa shift parameters ΔpKa.

Comparing the values of the shift parameters
for the molecular
families of the second data set by using the ETM or the JPM pKa values in water, we obtain practically the
same values except for the thiourea compounds (Table 2). This general agreement demonstrates the
reliability of the computed pKa values
in water. However, for thiourea, the shift parameters deviate by 2.3
pH units, which is considerable. Unfortunately, no measured pKa values in water are available for thiourea
compounds to resolve this discrepancy. These deviations may be connected
with the sulfur atomic radii of 2.00 and 2.18 Å used in water
and DMSO,13,27 respectively, which have not yet been tested
sufficiently carefully.

For cyano- and keto-compounds, the measured
pKa values in water are available in a
few cases. We also
found the measured pKa values in water
for four different keto-compounds (Table S10 of the Supporting Information). Except for cyclobutanone, the measured
pKa values agree well with the corresponding
values obtained by ETM and JPM, supporting our approach to establish
the empirical conversion method (ECM) with the pKa values in water obtained with ETM and JPM. For cyano-compounds,
we found only two measured pKa values.
These are 25.061 and 11.262 for CH3CN and CH2(CN)2, respectively (Table S10 of the Supporting
Information). These values deviate considerably from 20.89 and 4.25
computed with ETM or 19.23 and 7.96 obtained with JPM, respectively.
Interestingly, the ECM pKa values for
CH3CN in water are 24.90 and 25.30, if based on the ETM
or JPM pKa values in water, respectively.
Hence, the ensemble of molecules considered for the family of cyano-compounds
makes sure that the ECM estimate of the pKa value of CH3CN is appropriate. However, this is not the
case for the pKa value of CH2(CN)2, where the pKa values
in water estimated with ECM are 4.60 and 5.00, if based on the ETM
or JPM pKa values in water, respectively.
According to the measured pKa values of
CH2(CN)2 in DMSO (11.2) and water (11.0), which
are practically equal, [CH(CN)2]− should
solvate equally well or even better (because CH2(CN)2 is aprotic as is DMSO) in DMSO than in water. On the other
hand, the measured pKa values of CH3CN in water (31.3) and DMSO (25.0) suggest that [CH2CN]− solvates better in water than in DMSO. Hence,
the measured pKa value of CH2(CN)2 in water being practically equal to the value in
DMSO is not very plausible.

Summary
The empirical
pKa conversion method
(ECM) predicts the pKa values of titratable
compounds in organic solvents using known pKa values in water. The concept of the ECM, which uses a molecular
family dependent parameterization, seems to work also for large and
even flexible molecules. This indicates that the dependencies of pKa values on molecular conformations and interactions
of the titratable group with other functional molecular groups within
the solute molecule are moderate at least for the molecules studied
in this work. The ECM procedure uses a single additive shift parameter.
It is explained why an additional multiplicative shift parameter is
not useful. Two data sets of titratable molecules are considered.
The first data set involves 19 different molecular families with 81
different titratable compounds. Molecular family and solvent-specific
additive pKa shift parameters ΔpKa are evaluated relative to the pKa values in water, which, in their turn, are obtained
with the Jaguar pKa prediction method
(JPM)28,29 for the solvents acetonitrile, dimethyl
sulfoxide, and methanol (Table 1). The additive pKa shift parameters
are optimized using 87 measured and 107 pKa values that are computed with the electrostatic transform method
(ETM).27 The ETM may also be very useful
in extending the ECM of the present work to other solvents where the
database of measured pKa values is small.
By combining the pKa shift parameters
ΔpKa of Table 1 additively, pKa values can be converted between arbitrary pairs of solvents involving
water, DMSO, acetonitrile, and methanol. The average accuracy of the
ECM pKa values is found to be about 0.5
pH units. The agreement between the measured and the ETM computed
pKa values demonstrates the usefulness
of this method, which can be employed to enlarge the database of known
pKa values for different solvents.

An analysis of the additive parameters shifting the water pKa value of a molecule to the corresponding values
in other solvents reveals that there are two categories of molecules:
very polar molecules involving preferentially titratable oxygen and
nitrogen with a single hydrogen attached and less polar molecules
involving either titratable nitrogen with several hydrogens attached
or carbon atoms. The first category involves molecules with solvation
energies that disfavor deprotonation in aprotic organic solvents compared
to water. The molecules from the second category have solvation energy
differences between protonated and deprotonated species, which are
about the same in water and different organic solvents.

The
second data set of titratable molecules involves five molecular
families with 76 molecules. Most of these molecules are considerably
larger than the molecules of the first data set. Here, the measured
pKa values are available essentially only
for DMSO. The pKa shift parameters between
water and DMSO are optimized by using computed pKa values in water obtained with ETM or JPM. These two
sets of shift parameters agreed well except for the family thiourea
demonstrating the validity of the ECM for the other four families
(Table 2). In the few
cases where the measured pKa values in
water are available, the computed pKa values
agree with the corresponding measured values except in one case (the
keto-compound cyclobutanone) where the measured pKa value is doubtful.
