Organoruthenium complexes are potent
alternatives for platinum-based
complexes because of their superior anticancer activity. In this investigation,
a series of new Ru(II)-arene complexes with triarylamine–thiosemicarbazone
hybrid ligands with higher anticancer activity than cisplatin are
reported. The molecular structure of the ligands and complexes was
confirmed spectroscopically and supported by single-crystal X-ray
crystallography. These complexes adopted a three-leg piano stool geometry.
All the Ru(II)-arene complexes were systematically investigated for
their in vitro cytotoxicity against human cervical (HeLa S3), lung
(A549) cancer, and human normal lung (IMR-90) cell lines using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay. Interestingly, a pyrrolidine-attached Ru(II)-benzene
complex exhibited superior activity against cancer cells with low
IC50 values, and colony formation study showed complete
inhibition at 5 and 10 μM concentration. Furthermore, morphological
changes assessed by acridine orange and propidium iodide staining
revealed that the cell death occurred by apoptosis. In addition, the
interaction between synthesized Ru(II)-arene complexes and DNA/protein
was explored by absorption and emission spectroscopy methods. These
synthesized new organoruthenium complexes can be used for developing
new metal-based anticancer drugs.

Introduction
The metal complexes
are well exploited for their anticancer activity
with an enormous impact on cancer chemotherapy. Because of their peculiar
structure and better electronic, magnetic, thermodynamic, kinetic,
and intrinsic properties, metal ions are widely used for the development
of new highly potent anticancer agents, DNA probes, and cleaving agents.1 Cisplatin and related platinum-based chemotherapeutic
drugs are active against various types of human cancers. The success
of platinum-based drugs lagged behind because of their adverse effects
on human health including kidney diseases, hemorrhage, and intrinsic
and acquired resistance against various cancers.2 To overcome the aforementioned issues, researchers have
diverted their attention from Pt-based drugs to design alternative
biocompatible metal-based drugs.3,4 Ruthenium-based complexes
are reported as target-specific and less toxic with high pharmacological
effect.5 In particular, NAMI-A “imidazolium trans-[tetrachlorido(DMSO)(1H-imidazole)ruthenate(III)]”and
KP1019 “imidazolium trans-[tetrachloridobis(1H-indazole)ruthenate(III)]” complexes exhibited remarkable
activity against antimetastatic and solid tumors.6 At present, the formulation of KP1019 has been slightly
modified because of solubility reasons and renamed as NKP-1339 (also
IT-139). This formulation is currently being used in clinical trials
and also got FDA orphan status in 2017, while the clinical trials
for NAMI-A have been abandoned. Recently, Ru(II)-arene-based metallodrugs
are projected as potential and effective candidates for cancer treatment.7,8 An impressive architecture was obtained by incorporating π-bonded
arene moiety with biologically significant ligands, such as ethacrynic
acid,9 anti-inflammatory drugs,10 quinolone,11 and
thiosemicarbazone (TSC).12

The design
and structure of arene moiety play a crucial role in
establishing the pharmacological properties of the complexes, viz.
influence in cell uptake, binding to the active center, and inertness
to other substituents.13 Another great
advantage is the passive transport across the cell membrane because
of the enhanced hydrophobicity.14 From
literature, it has been evidently analyzed that the π-stacking
of arene ligand enhances the interaction of metal complexes with DNA
or protein which is the reason for their biological activity and various
pharmacological properties.15 Arene moiety
also stabilizes the oxidation state of Ru(II) and provides a hydrophobic
face, enhances biomolecular recognition process, and improves the
transport through cell membrane.16 The
evaluation of Ru(II)-arene complexes with the pta (1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane),
[RuCl2(η6-p-cymene)(pta)]
(PAPTA-C), [RuCl2(η6-benzene)(pta)] (PAPTA-B),
and Ru(II)-arene-en (en-ethylenediamine) had been reported along with
in vivo activity on the inhibition of metastasis growth with high
selectivity and low toxicity (Figure 1).17

and (c) Ru-arene-en.

Thus, Ru(II)-arene with suitable ligand moiety proves to
influence
the cytotoxicity and efficiency.18 Recently,
plenty of Ru(II)-arene-based complexes are being reported with high
anticancer activity.19 These complexes
unquestionably proved substantial in vitro cytotoxicity with apoptosis
as the mechanism for cell death.20 TSC
and triarylamine (TAA) molecules are significant constituents which
are attracting the interdisciplinary field of research because of
their notable geometry and chemical stability.21 TAAs possess impressive biological activity with enhanced
fluorescence emission. The mechanism of inducing cell death upon photoactivation
is associated with its unique style of interaction with the cell nucleus.22 TSCs are other vital constituents in the field
of medicinal chemistry because of their coordination flexibility and
biological versatility. A combination of TSC and TAA derivatives can
result into a chief component for anticancer and other therapeutic
drugs. Even though the latter is commonly used as a metal-ligating
compound, the complexes with both TSCs and TAAs are not frequently
reported.23 This paves a need for more
discussion about the beneficial effects exhibited by this combination
and by metal coordination. The valuable features of ruthenium as a
metal with arene moiety and TSC/TAA ligands inspired us to develop
potent Ru(II)-arene complexes as a therapeutic agent.

In this
work, we have synthesized a series of new half-sandwich
Ru(II)-arene complexes containing TAAs and TSCs as chelating ligands.
The unique combination of these ligands with Ru(II)-arene complexes
has not been reported. The interaction of the new complexes with DNA
and human serum albumin (HSA) is examined. In order to get an insight
into the morphological changes, acridine orange (AO) and propidium
iodide (PI) staining assays are also scrutinized. Cell proliferation
behavior is analyzed by the colony formation method.

Results and Discussion
The complexes were synthesized from thiosemicarbazide and aromatic
aldehyde via condensation reaction (Scheme 1). The complexes [(η6-p-cymene)-RuII(L1)Cl]Cl (1), [(η6-p-cymene)-RuII(L2)Cl]Cl (2), [(η6-p-cymene)-RuII(L3)Cl]Cl (3), and [(η6-p-cymene)-RuII(L4)Cl]Cl (4) were
obtained in good yield (82–87%) by using [RuCl(μ-Cl)(η6-p-cymene)]2 and TSC ligands (Scheme 2). The TSC ligands
(L1–L4) on treatment with Ru(II)-benzene dimer
[(η6-benzene)-RuIICl(μ-Cl)]2 gave ideal complexes [(η6-benzene)-RuII(L1)Cl]Cl (5), [(η6-benzene)-RuII(L2)Cl]Cl (6), [(η6-benzene)-RuII(L3)Cl]Cl (7), and [(η6-benzene)-RuII(L4)Cl]Cl (8) (Scheme 3). All the TSC ligands and their corresponding
Ru(II)-arene complexes were characterized by UV-visible, Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectrometry
(MS) techniques.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Ru(II)-benzene Complexes
The electronic spectral data
of complexes 1–8 in methanol exhibits two absorption
bands. The first band corresponds
to the n → π* transition appeared around 268–295
nm. Subsequently, the second band in the region 339–365 nm
observed as a broad band owing to metal-to-ligand charge transfer
(MLCT).33 The FT-IR spectra of TSC ligands
exhibited very strong bands because of ν(N–H) in the
region of 3453–3134 cm–1.

Other characteristic
bands were observed in the range of 1600–1584
and 1321–1244 cm–1, which were assigned to
ν(C=N) and ν(C=S), respectively. After the
formation of complexes, there was a decrease in thiocarbonyl ν(C=S)
and azomethine (C=N) stretching frequencies, which indicates
the involvement of sulfur and nitrogen atoms in coordination with
ruthenium ions.34

Electrospray ionization
(ESI)-MS spectra show molecular ion peaks
of ligands L1–L4 (Figure S1) and complexes 1–8 (Figures S2 and S3). The ESI-MS spectra of ligand L1 showed
[M + H]+ peaks and those of other ligands (L2, L3, and L4) exhibited [M – H]− peaks. The molecular ion peaks for complexes 1–8 were not observed, which may be due to possible
fragmentation of the molecules. These complexes exhibited peaks due
to [M – 2Cl – H]+, suggesting that the Cl
group is labile.35

In the 1H NMR spectra of ligands L1–L4 imine (=N–NH)
and azomethine (HC=N), protons
appeared at 9.12–8.76 and 7.69–7.54 ppm. The same protons
in complexes 1–4 were deshielded and appeared
at 13.79–14.53 ppm. The aromatic protons of the ligands and
complexes resonate in the range of 7.52–7.01 ppm (Figure S4) and 8.27–7.09 ppm, respectively.
The signals due to pyrrolidine protons in L1, L2, 1, 2, 5, and 6 appeared in the range of 3.96–1.96 ppm. In the spectra of L3, L4, 3, 4, 7, and 8, signals of cyclohexyl protons are found
in the regions 4.30–3.89 and 2.04–1.23 ppm. New signals
were observed in the region 5.50–4.97 ppm, which is due to
the presence of p-cymene complexes361–4 (Figure S6), whereas a signal at 5.56–5.54 ppm for complexes 5–8 (Figure S7) showed the presence of benzene
ring.37 In the 13C spectra of
ligands L1–L4 (Figure S5) and complexes 1–8, thiocarbonyl (C=S)
and imine (C=N) carbon signals appeared around 176.1–175.7
and 174.8–171.2 ppm, respectively. All aromatic carbons in
the ligands and complexes appeared in the range of 149.6–119.7
(ligands) and 150.6–119.2 ppm (complexes). 13C NMR
spectra of the complexes, a new signal at 103.9–82.1 ppm, confirmed
the presence of p-cymene group in complexes 1–4 (Figure S8) and a new
peak at 87.6–87.1 ppm validated the occurrence of benzene moiety
in complexes 5–8 (Figure S9).

The molecular structures of L1, L2, L3, and L4 and 3 have been
investigated
by X-ray crystallography. Suitable crystals were obtained by slow
diffusion of dichloromethane/methanol solution of samples and for L2 and L4 DMSO was used as an additive. Crystallographic
data, description, and selected interatomic bond lengths and angles
are given in Tables S1–S4. Thermal
ellipsoid plots of compounds with the atomic labeling schemes are
shown in Figures 2 and S10–S13. Our ligands are composed of three
main parts: TAA group connected to pyrrolidine/cyclohexyl by TSC moiety.
The structure revealed that the central nitrogen atom of TAA is in
sp2 hybridization and the three benzene rings are twisted
with respect to one other, existing in a propeller-like fashion. The
molecule has E conformation with respect to the N2–N3;
the bond length was 1.370, 1.385, 1.380, and 1.386 Å; and the
dihedral angle was 177.0, 164.7, 173.3, and 173.2° for ligands.
All molecules exhibited quasi-coplanarity in the plane of TSC and
exists in thione (C=S) form, similar to other TSC systems.23 The molecular structure of complex 3 shows undoubtedly that the TSC ligand coordinates in a bidentate
manner with Ru ions via thiocarbonyl sulfur (Sneutral)
and azomethine nitrogen (Nneutral) along with one terminal
chlorido and one arene moiety. This complex has adopted the “piano
stool” geometry, where η6-p-cymene formed the top of the stool: the S, N (from TSC ligand) and
chlorido atoms served as legs. Ru metal sharing with S and N atoms
results in the formation of a five-membered chelate ring with bite
angles 86.87° S(1)–Ru(1)–Cl(1) and 87.18°
N(1)–Ru(1)–Cl(1). The twist in the bite angle has resulted
in distorted octahedral geometry around the Ru center. The bond distances
of Ru(1)–S(1), Ru(1)–N(1), and Ru(1)–Cl(1) are
2.3568, 2.1295, and 2.4171 Å, respectively. The η6-p-cymene unit is strongly bonded to the Ru metal
center with a typical Ru–C bond length of 2.2091 Å; moreover,
the average C–C bond lengths are found to be 1.4168 Å.
Upon complexation, the S(1)–C(5) and N(1)–C(1) bond
characteristics (1.700 and 1.290 Å, respectively) remain almost
unchanged, proving that the thione form coordinates with the Ru ions.
All these observations are in agreement with other recent reports.38−40 With respect to the spectral data and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis,
all the other seven complexes also possess similar geometrical features
of [(η6-p-cymene)-RuII(L3)Cl2] (3).

Interaction of the Complex with CT-DNA
Electronic Absorption Studies
The binding mode of DNA
with Ru(II)-arene complexes 1–8 was examined through
electronic absorption spectroscopy studies. All complexes exhibited
two absorption bands around 270–382 and 349–406 nm,
which are assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer and MLCT, respectively.
Upon successive addition of DNA to the fixed concentration of complexes,
hypochromism was observed with 3–4 nm red shift: this indicates
the intercalative mode of binding. The extent of shift and hypochromism
can be related to the DNA binding affinity.41 The absorption spectra of the complexes in the presence and absence
of CT-DNA is illustrated graphically in Figures 3 and S14. The
binding constant of the complexes with CT-DNA (Kb) was obtained from the ratio of slope to intercept by plotting
[DNA]/(εa – εf) versus [DNA]
according to the equation42 [DNA]/(εa – εf) = [DNA]/(εb – εf) + 1/Kb (εb – εf), where [DNA]
is the concentration of DNA in base pairs, εa is
the apparent extinction coefficient value found by calculating A(observed)/[complex], εf is
the extinction coefficient of the free compound, and εb is the extinction coefficient of the compound in the fully bound
form. Each set of data, when fitted into the above equation gave a
straight line with a slope of 1/(εb – εf) and y-intercept of 1/Kb (εb – εf) (Figure S15). The magnitude of intrinsic binding
constants (Kb) complexes followed the
order 5 > 3 > 1 > 6 > 2 > 7 > 8 > 2 and the values are presented in Table 1. The results revealed that
the binding constants
are in a similar range for the other reported complexes.43

Fluorescence Spectroscopy Studies
To further investigate
the mode of binding of the metal complexes with CT-DNA, the fluorescence
spectroscopy technique was employed. The fluorescence property was
not observed for the complexes at room temperature in solution or
in the presence of CT-DNA. Therefore, emission spectroscopy could
not directly predict the binding of the complexes with DNA. Hence,
a competitive binding study was carried out to comprehend the mode
of DNA interaction with the complexes.44 Ethidium bromide (EB) emits intense fluorescence in the presence
of CT-DNA because of the strong intercalation of the planar EB phenanthridine
ring and the adjacent base pairs of the double helix. Therefore, EB
can be considered as a typical indicator for intercalation. When a
molecule that could bind more efficiently to DNA than when EB was
added, the molecule will replace the bounded EB and there will be
a quenching in the DNA-induced EB emission. The extent of quenching
of CT-DNA–EB reflects the extent of interaction with the added
molecule. The fluorescence intensity (607 nm) of CT-DNA pretreated
EB system was observed to exhibit decreases (Figures 4 and S17) with
successive addition of Ru(II) complexes (0–50 μM): quenching
percentage with our complexes was calculated as 66, 61, 64, 58, 71,
60, 62, and 48% and resulted in hypsochromic shift of 11, 8, 7, 10,
13, 15, 9, and 8 nm, respectively. The magnitude of interaction between
complexes and DNA is quantitatively calculated by using Stern–Volmer
equation,45Fo/F = 1 + Kq[Q], where Fο and F are the fluorescence
intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively, Kq is a linear Stern–Volmer quenching
constant, and [Q] is the concentration of complex. Figure S16 shows good Stern–Volmer plots, and the good
linearity of the plots suggests a singular mode of quenching. The
apparent DNA binding constant (Kapp) was
calculated by using the equation.46KEB[EB] = Kapp[complex],
where [complex] is the complex concentration at 50% reduction in the
fluorescence intensity of EB, KEB = 1.0
× 107 M–1 and [EB] = 5 μM.
The study was carried out with an EB concentration of 10–3 M, DNA of 10–3 M, and metal complexes in 10–3 M with further dilution to 15 μM for EB and
[DNA] and 5 μM for complexes. The probe was carried out with
10 equiv additions of metal complexes to the sample cuvette containing
solution of buffer, EB, and DNA. The intrinsic fluorescence emission
spectra of all the compounds were recorded separately before and after
the addition of varying concentrations of complexes (0–50 μM)
and the quenching constant Kq and Kapp values follows order 5 > 6 > 1 > 2 > 7 > 3 > 4 > 8 and
the values are listed
in Table 1. From the
absorption and emission spectra analysis, complex 5 is
found to have better DNA binding nature than the other complexes.

of complexes 1 and 5. [DNA] = 5 μM,
[EB] = 5 μM, and [complex] = 0–50 μM. Arrow shows
a decrease in absorption upon increasing DNA concentration.

Interaction of the Complex
with HSA
Fluorescence Titration Studies
HSA plays a vital role
in the transportation of drugs and compounds such as fatty acids which
bind reversibly to HSA. Binding of the drugs to this extracellular
protein can alter its metabolism and distribution as well as concentration.
Reports show that the forces of interaction between HSA and complexes
consist of hydrogen bond formation, van der Waals forces, electrostatic
forces, and hydrophobic interactions. Thus, it is necessary to study
the interaction of the drugs with HSA. Fluorescence spectrophotometry
is a common technique to study molecular interaction with proteins.
Tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are the three residues responsible
for the autofluorescence activity of HSA. HSA comprises 585 amino
acid residues with a single tryptophan residue (Trp 214) obligation
for the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA.47 The fluctuations in the graph thus obtained after the addition of
the metal complexes suggested that binding occurs on the protein.
Here, we have performed the emission-quenching experiments by increasing
the amount of the complex solution to a fixed quantity of HSA (Figure S18), and fluorescence intensity at 345
nm decreases up to 69, 59, 64, 66, 78, 68, 62, and 70% for complexes 1–8, with a hypochromic shift of 8, 7, 11, 10, 13,
12, 11, and 9 nm for complexes 1–8, respectively.
The complexes interact hydrophobically with proteins, which is evident
from the observed hypochromism. The fluorescence quenching is described
by the Stern–Volmer48 relation given
as Fo/F = 1 + Kq[Q], where Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence
of quencher, respectively. Kq is a linear
Stern–Volmer quenching constant and [Q] is the quencher concentration.
A linear plot is obtained from the graph of Fo/F versus [Q] plot (Figure S19). Further, the equilibrium between free and bound molecules
is represented by the Scatchard equation: log[(Fo – F)/F] = log Kb + n log[Q], where Kb is the binding constant of the complex with
HSA and n is the number of binding sites (Table S1),49 from
the plot of log [(Fo – F)/F] versus log[Q] (Figure S20).

Anticancer Activity
All the synthesized
Ru(II)-arene
complexes (1–8) were tested against A549 and HeLa
S3 cancer cell lines. The graph of percentage (%) of cell viability
versus concentration is presented in Figure S23, and the IC50 (half minimum inhibition concentration)
value of the complexes is shown in Table 2. Among all the complexes, complex 5 showed promising cytotoxic activity against both HeLa S3
and A549 cancer cells. Complex 5 showed 50% of inhibition
at 5.3 ± 3.8 μM in HeLa S3 cells and 7.24 ± 5.4 μM
in A549 cells. In addition, complexes 1, 3, and 6 showed moderate cytotoxicity activity in HeLa
S3 cells with an IC50 value of 69.5 ± 4.5, 77.6 ±
3.5, and 85.6 ± 4.2 μM, respectively. However, complex 6 also showed moderate cytotoxic activity in A549 cells with
an IC50 value of 18.9 ± 5.8 μM (Table 2). The cytotoxic effects of
complexes 1, 3, 5, and 6 against human normal lung IMR-90 cell line (Figure S24) showed less toxicity compared with
cancer cells with an IC50 value of 81.5 ± 1.6, >100
± 1.8, 39 ± 4.7, and >100 ± 5.9 μM. It is
remarkable
to mention that complex 5 is more active compared with
cisplatin.50,51 The present reported complexes,
particularly 5 and 6, displayed low IC50 values compared with the previously reported Ru-p-cymene and Ru-benzene complexes against A549 and HeLa
S3 cancer cells.34,52 The activity of complexes 2 and 3 was also comparable with reported ruthenium-arene
complexes against HeLa S3 and A549 cell lines.53 It is evident from the comparison that our complexes showed
good cytotoxic property with the earlier reported ruthenium-arene
complexes (Figure 5). Cytotoxicity results indicate higher activity of complexes because
of the nature of the chelating TSC/TAA ligand and arene moiety.

AO/PI Staining
The morphological change associated
with apoptotic cell death was confirmed by fluorescence images using
AO/PI. AO is an indication of live cells and PI is an indication of
dead cells. After 24 h treatment of complex 5 (10 μM),
dramatic morphological changes, nuclear condensation, and cell shrinkage
were observed in HeLa S3 and A549 cancer cells (Figures 6 and 7).

Colony Formation Studies
Cell proliferation was confirmed
by colony formation study. Complex 5 was treated with
HeLa S3 and A549 cancer cells to assess the colony formation ability
(Figure 8). The results
clearly indicated that complex 5 exhibited complete inhibition
of colony formation at 5 and 10 μM in HeLa S3 cells and 10 and
20 μM in A54954,55 cells. Therefore, complex 5 not only shows cytotoxic effects but also induces morphological
changes and inhibits colony formation in HeLa S3 and A549 cells.

Conclusions
In this work, we have designed and synthesized eight new Ru(II)-arene
complexes bearing bidentate S(neutral) and N(neutral) chelating TSC ligands. The molecular structure of the ligands and
complex 3 was established by single-crystal XRD studies.
On the basis of crystallographic data, the typical piano stool geometry
of complex was projected. The binding affinity of the complexes with
DNA/protein was assessed using spectrophotometric methods. The spectroscopic
values have interpreted that the complexes exhibit good binding affinity
toward DNA with the appreciable binding constant. The complexes are
bounded to DNA via intercalation. The complex with a five-membered
pyrrolidine substituent shows the higher binding ability. In vitro
studies show that complexes 5 and 6 have
very potent anticancer activity in HeLa S3 and A549 cancer cell lines.
IC50 values indicated that complex 5 is appreciably
superior to the prominent anticancer drug cisplatin. Nucleus staining
was confirmed by fluorescence images using AO/PI. After 24 h treatment
of complex 5 (10 μM), dramatic morphological changes,
nuclear condensation, and cell shrinkage were observed in HeLa S3
and A549 cancer cells. Furthermore, cell proliferation was identified
using colony formation ability studies. The results clearly indicated
that complex 5 exhibited complete inhibition in HeLa
S3 and A549 cancer cells at lower concentrations. The toxicity of
complexes (1, 3, 5, and 6) was also studied against human normal lung IMR90 cell line.
Our present investigation demonstrated that introduction of TAA–TSC
ligand to the Ru(II)-arene complexes can be a key for developing potent
anticancer drugs.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
RuCl3·3H2O was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
All the other reagents
and solvents were received from various suppliers and used without
further purification. FT-IR spectra in the range of 4000–500
cm–1 were obtained as attenuated total reflection
(ATR) pellets using a PerkinElmer Frontier FT-IR/far-infrared spectrometer.
Both 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in
CDCl3 solvent by using tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard in a Bruker spectrometer (400/500 and 100/125 MHz, respectively).
Electronic absorption spectra were recorded by a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer.
The melting points (triplicate measurements) were determined in open
capillary tubes on a Lab India instrument and uncorrected. The ESI-MS
spectra of ligands and complexes were recorded on a Thermo ExactivePlus
mass spectrometer in positive mode (L1 and 1–8) and negative mode (L2, L3, and L4). The elemental analyses were performed using a Vario EL-III
CHNS analyzer.

Synthesis of TSC Ligands
The new
TSC ligands L1–L4 were synthesized by direct condensation
of corresponding
thiosemicarbazide with modified TAAs. Both reactants were suspended
in methanol (30 mL) containing a few drops of glacial acetic acid.
The mixture was refluxed at 60–70 °C for 6 h and allowed
to attain room temperature. The product was obtained as a yellow solid;
it was then filtered, washed with cold methanol, and dried in vacuo.
Methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) mixture was used to obtain crystals
of the compounds.

Complexes
[(η6-p-Cymene)-RuIICl(μ-Cl)]2 was
prepared using a previously reported method.24 The[(η6-p-cymene)-RuII(TSC)Cl]Cl complexes were obtained by reacting the dimer [RuCl(μ-Cl)(η6-p-cymene)]2 (0.1224 g, 0.2 mmol)
and TSC ligands. To a warm solution (34 °C) of TSC in a CH2Cl2/CH3OH mixture (20 mL v/v 3:1), one
portion of [RuCl(μ-Cl)(η6-p-cymene)]2 in CH2Cl2 (4 mL) was
added and stirred for 12–14 h at room temperature. The dark
red color solution was concentrated to ∼2 mL under reduced
pressure, and addition of hexane (20 mL) gave a colored solid. The
product was collected by filtration, washed with petroleum ether,
and dried in vacuo.

XRD Studies
A
Leica MZ 75 microscope was used to identify
faces with dimensions of representative sample crystal. The selected
crystal was fixed in nitrogen stream (Oxford) at 100 K with the help
of a nylon loop. All reflection data were acquired on a Bruker APEX2
X-ray diffractometer. Program APEX226 was
employed to obtain the data-integrated intensity of each reflection,
which was possible by data frame reduction. Three-dimensional profiling
algorithmic integration was used and the collected data were corrected
with respect to crystal decay effects and polarization factors. The
absorption effect27 data were collected
from SADABS. A solution was produced by SHELXTL (XS).28 The H atoms were geometrically fixed and set riding on
the corresponding parent atoms. The final data representation and
structure plots were acquired by Olex.29

DNA Binding Studies
DNA binding experiments were performed
by UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopy methods. The required
concentration of the compounds was prepared by dissolving the complexes
in 5% dimethylformamide/Tris-HCl/NaCl. CT-DNA was dissolved in 50
mM NaCl/5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and stored at 4 °C. The DNA solution
was diluted to get an absorbance corresponding to 6600 M–1 cm–1 at 260 nm.30,31 The 15 μM
concentration of the complex was titrated against CT-DNA (0–40
μM). The spectra were recorded after equilibration for 3 min,
allowing the compounds to bind to the CT-DNA.

The competitive
binding of the complexes were investigated with EB by fluorescence
technique. EB solution was prepared using Tris-HCl/NaCl buffer (pH
7.2). The test solution was added in aliquots of 5 μM concentration
to DNA–EB and the change in fluorescence intensities at 596
nm (450 nm excitation) was recorded.

HSA Binding Studies
The binding of Ru(II)-arene complexes
(1–8) with HSA was studied using fluorescence
spectra, recorded at a fixed excitation wavelength corresponding to
HSA at 280 nm and monitoring the emission at 335 nm. The excitation
and emission slit widths and scan rates were maintained for all the
experiments. Stock solution of HSA was prepared in Tris-buffer (50
mM NaCl/5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) and stored in the dark at 4 °C
for further use. Concentrated stock solutions of each test compounds
were prepared by dissolving them in Tris-buffer and diluted with Tris-buffer
to get required concentrations. HSA (2.5 mL) solution was titrated
by successive additions of 10–6 M stock solution
of complexes using a micropipette.32 For
synchronous fluorescence spectra measurements, the same concentration
of HSA and the complexes were used and the spectra were measured at
two different Δλ (difference between the excitation and
emission wavelengths of HSA) values of 15 and 60 nm.

Cytotoxicity
Cytotoxic study was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. A549, HeLa S3, and IMR-90 cells were purchased
from ATCC, USA. A549 and HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (10% fetal bovine serum and
2 mM l-glutamine, along with antibiotics) at 37 °C with
5% CO2. Cells/well (2 × 104) were seeded
in 96-well plates and incubated at a humidified condition. The Ru(II)-arene
complexes were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 0.5%). The cells
were treated with different concentrations of Ru(II)-arene complexes
(100–3.125 μM) and incubated for 24 h. After treatment,
cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated
with fresh DMEM containing MTT (5 mg/mL). The plates were incubated
for 3–4 h at dark condition and 100 μL of DMSO was added
to each well. The cytotoxicity data were measured at 570 nm. The percentage
of cytotoxicity was calculated by the following formula, inhibition
(%) = A – B/A × 100 (A = control group and B = treated group).

Cell Death Analysis Using Fluorescence Probes
HeLa
S3 and A549 (3 × 105) cancer cells were seeded in
30 mm dishes and incubated overnight at a humidified condition (37
°C with 5% CO2). HeLa S3 and A549 cancer cells were
treated with complex 5 for 24 h. After treatment, cells
were incubated with AO/PI (10 μM) solution for 15 min at dark
condition. The images were captured under a fluorescence microscope
(Biorevo, BZ-9000, Keyence, 20×).

Colony Formation Studies
HeLa S3 and A549 cancer cells
(1 × 103) were seeded in a 24-well plate and incubated
overnight. The HeLa S3 and A549 cells were treated with complex 5 cells for 24 h. After 24 treatments, the cells were washed
with PBS and incubated with fresh DMEM for 10 days. The cells were
stained with crystal violet solution and the data were calculated
by ImageJ software.
