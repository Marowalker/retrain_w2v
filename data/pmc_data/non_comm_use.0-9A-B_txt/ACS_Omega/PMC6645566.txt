Nitrogen-containing organic chemicals
such as amines, amides, nitriles,
and hydrazones are crucial in chemical and medical industries. This
paper reports a direct synthesis of N,N-dimethyl cyanamide [(CH3)2NCN] and amino acetonitrile
(NH2CH2CN) through a methane/ammonia (CH4/NH3) coupling reaction triggered by dielectric
barrier discharge plasma, with by-products of hydrazine, amines, and
hydrazones. The influence of CH4/NH3 molar ratio,
feedstock residence time, and specific energy input on the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction has been investigated
and discussed. Under the optimized conditions, the productivities
of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN reached 0.46 and 0.82 g·L–1·h–1, respectively, with 8.83% CH4 conversion.
In addition, through combining the optical emission spectra diagnosis
and the reaction results, a possible CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction mechanism has been proposed. This paper
provides a potential fine application of CH4 and NH3 in green synthesis of liquid nitrogen-containing organic

1 Introduction
Nitrogen-containing
organic chemicals, such as amines, amides,
nitriles, and hydrazones are crucial in chemical and medical industries.
The productive processes of these nitrogen-containing chemicals, however,
are usually multistep and complicated, in which massive waste gas,
waste liquid, and solid waste were brought inevitably. In addition,
some rare and expensive nitrogen reagents such as azides and metallonitrene
were usually used.1−5 Therefore, there have been increasing interests on developing some
novel and green methodologies to synthesize these nitrogen-containing
chemicals using simpler and cheaper feedstocks.6−9

Cyanamides and amino nitriles,
two building blocks containing C≡N
bond, are the basic structure in organic synthesis, especially in
the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds10−14 and amino acids.15 Currently, N,N-dimethyl cyanamide [(CH3)2NCN] and amino acetonitrile (NH2CH2CN) are two important chemical intermediates in medicine synthesis.
However, the industrial synthesis of (CH3)2NCN
and NH2CH2CN requires several steps and emits
acidic wastes, as shown in Scheme 1.16

Scheme 1 Reaction Process
for the Industrial Synthesis of (CH3)2NCN and
NH2CH2CN
The direct coupling reaction of methane (CH4) and ammonia
(NH3) to form C≡N bond is very significant and highly
desired because the feedstocks (CH4 and NH3)
are relatively abundant and cheap. Industrially, the CH4/NH3 coupling reaction has been conducted over Pt gauze
catalysts for the synthesis of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), where high
reaction temperature (>1100 °C) is required due to the high
thermodynamic
stability of CH4 and NH3 molecules, as shown
in Scheme 2.17 This coupling reaction has been attempted using
a microwave plasma,18 and 78% CH4 conversion was achieved at 500 W input power. However, no product
other than HCN was obtained. In fact, the synthesis of chemicals by
using plasma technologies has a long history. Ozone was synthesized
from air silent discharge in 1857,19 and
dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma is still the most effective
method for industrial production of ozone. In 1967, Spedding reported
the direct synthesis of hydrazine from NH3 employing a
gas discharge reactor,20 and he also reported
the synthesis of certain unusual and highly reactive compounds, such
as diboron tetrachloride (B2Cl4), decaborane
(B10H16), oxy-fluorides (O4F2, O2F2), and krypton and xenon tetrafluoride
(KrF4, XeF4), which are so unstable that they
decompose during conventional synthesis.20 In 1970, Suhr reported the single-step synthesis of biphenylene
from 9-fluorenone in a discharge plasma,21 and he also demonstrated that hydrocarbons can take place isomerization
reaction, elimination reaction, bimolecular addition reaction, and
selective oxidation reaction.22 Recently,
Liu reported that long-chain hydrocarbons were produced from CH4 plasma and CH4/CO2 plasma;23,24 Cooks published a paper reporting the selective reduction of benzene
in a helium plasma;25 Benoit reported that
nonthermal atmospheric plasma can be considered as a promising technology
for enhancing the depolymerization of recalcitrant cellulose toward
hydrolysis.26 Our group demonstrated that
DBD plasma is a potential method for direct synthesis of high purity
H2O2 from H2 and O2 without
using any catalysts.27−30 We also reported that high-value liquid chemicals and fuels were
produced through a CH4–CO2 reforming
reaction in a designed DBD plasma reactor.31 For the best of our knowledge, the direct synthesis of the C≡N
group containing compounds except HCN by CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction has not yet been reported.

Scheme 2 Reaction
Process for the Industrial Synthesis of HCN
This paper reports that, under ambient temperature and
atmospheric
pressure, NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN can be produced as the major products from the CH4/NH3 DBD plasma, while, some other liquid chemicals,
such as hydrazine, amines, and hydrazones, were produced as well.
The direct synthesis of high-value NH2CH2CN,
(CH3)2NCN, and HCN from CH4/NH3 plasma could not only promote the fine utilization of CH4 and NH3 but also open a new way for the green
synthesis of compounds containing both the C≡N bond and the
amino group.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Experimental Setup
The schematic
of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. The flow of CH4 and NH3 was controlled by mass flow controllers. Before discharge, CH4 and NH3 were mixed homogeneously to pass through
the DBD plasma reactor for 10 min. Then, the voltage of a high-voltage
electrode (HVE) was adjusted to initiate the DBD discharge (high-performance
computerized plasma and corona discharge experiment generators CTP-2000K).
The discharge voltage, discharge current, and input power were measured
on site by a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 3012, HV probe Tektronix
P6015A, current probe Pearson 6585). The discharge images were taken
by a camera (Nikon D50). The optical emission spectra of CH4/NH3 plasma were monitored by optical emission spectroscopy
(OES) (Princeton Instrument SP 2758, 300 g/mm grating, 40 μm
slit width, and 1 s explosion time) to study the mechanism of reaction
between CH4 and NH3. Gas chromatography (GC)
was used to analyze the gas phase products. CO with a fixed flow rate
(10 mL/min) was introduced at the outlet to mix with the exhaust gas
as an external standard to measure the flow rate of the exhaust gas.
Then, the mixed exhaust gas was analyzed using an online GC equipped
with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD). The FID was used to analyze the concentration of hydrocarbons
in the exhaust gas. The TCD was used to analyze the concentration
of CH4 and CO, whereas a little N2 was also
detected, which may come from NH3 decomposition. After
that, the total flow rate of the exhaust gas can be calculated according
to the flow rate and concentration of CO (calculated using external
standard curve); then, the flow rate of CH4 in the exhaust
gas can be calculated according to the concentration of CH4 and the total flow rate. The liquid product was collected by the
coolant of ice water first and then analyzed using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) (Agilent 7890A GC, 5975C single-level
four-poles mass spectrometry) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
(Japan company: Nicolet 6700, ZnSe window plates). Interestingly,
in the gas phase, little hydrocarbons were detected by the FID, indicating
that most of the products were collected in the liquid. It is worth
noting that, to prevent poisoning and environmental pollution, the
experiment operators should always wear a gas mask and gloves; the
liquid product was sealed in a bottle and stored in a fridge; and
the exhaust gas in the outlet of GC was burned in a high-temperature
furnace.

Figure 1 Schematic of the DBD experimental setup for the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction.

2.2 Plasma Reactor
A single DBD (SDBD)
reactor (Figure 2)
was used for the CH4/NH3 DBD plasma coupling
reaction. The SDBD reactor had two coaxial glass cylinders and two
electrodes. The inner cylinder was made of pyrex with an inner diameter
of 8 mm and an outer diameter of 10 mm. The wall of the inner cylinder
served as a dielectric barrier for the discharge. The outer cylinder,
which had a liquid inlet at the bottom and a liquid outlet at the
top, was also made of glass, and it was used to form an annular gap
between the inner and outer cylinders.

Figure 2 Schematic of the SDBD
reactor for the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction
(1—HVE; 2—gas inlet; 3—circulating
water inlet; 4—collector; 5—gas outlet; 6—ground
electrode (GE); and 7—circulating water outlet).

The HVE of the SDBD reactor was a stainless-steel
rod (2 mm o.d.,
surface composition: Fe 68.5 wt %, Cr 19.9 wt %, Ni 8.1 wt %, Mn 2.0
wt %, Si 0.5 wt %, Cu 0.7 wt %, Ag 0.1 wt %, Al 0.1 wt %, and C 0.1
wt %), which was installed along the axis of the inner glass cylinder
and was connected to the alternating current (ac) power supply. The
GE was composed of circulating water (30 °C), which filled in
the annular gap of the glass cylinders, and was linked to the grounding
wire through a tungsten connection welded across the wall of the outer
cylinder. Thus, the reaction temperature in the SDBD reactor was maintained
at nearly 30 °C, which was confirmed by the thermal infrared
imager (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). A cylindrical discharge space with a length of 50 mm and a volume
of 2.36 mL was formed between HVE and GE.

2.3 Qualitative
Analysis of Products
As mentioned in the experimental setup,
the chemicals in the liquid
product were qualitatively analyzed using GC–MS (Agilent 7890A
GC, 5975C single-level four poles mass spectrometry). Liquid product
(1 μL) was injected into the sample inlet before starting the
GC–MS program (20 °C/min). The liquid product was also
qualitatively analyzed using FTIR (Japan company: Nicolet 6700, ZnSe
window plates).

2.4 Quantitative Analysis of
Reaction Results
The CH4 conversion F1, the productivities
of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN F2, and the energy efficiency F3 have been used to evaluate the performance of the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction for the direct synthesis
of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN.

In F1, the moles of initial CH4 were controlled by a mass flow controller; the moles of CH4 converted were measured by GC, as described in section 2.1. In F2, the mass of the product was calculated using the
concentration of products [NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN], and the total mass of the liquid product
was collected. Because the standard samples of some other chemicals
were not available, the internal standard analysis method of GC could
not be carried out; thus, the concentrations of products [NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN] were measured
by GC using the external standard method, and no internal standard
was used. The mass of the product in F3 is the
same as that in F2. The GC external calibration
curves of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN are shown in Figures S2 and S3, respectively. F1   F2   F3  

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Typical Results of the
CH4/NH3 Plasma Reaction
Under the conditions
of 20 mL/min
CH4, 20 mL/min NH3, 3.5 s feedstock residence
time, 12 kHz discharge frequency, 60 W input power, and 8 h discharge
time, some liquid products were obtained in the collector of the SDBD
reactor. The GC–MS chromatograph profile of the liquid products
is shown in Figure 3, which indicates that there were about 10 kinds of chemicals (marked
with capital letter A–J) in the liquid. The belongings
of the 10 chemicals identified by mass spectrometry (Figure S2, Supporting Information) are shown in Table 1. Figure 3 and Table 1 show that NH2CH2CN
(marked by H) and (CH3)2NCN (marked
by G) were produced. In addition, hydrazine (marked by C), amines (marked by B and D),
triazole (marked by I), and hydrazones (marked by E, F, and J) were also synthesized
by the CH4/NH3 plasma reaction. The liquid products
were also qualitatively analyzed using FTIR (Japan company: Nicolet
6700, ZnSe window plates). FTIR results (Figure S3, Supporting Information) indicate that the product molecules
possess NH2, C≡N, and CH functional groups, which
agree with the belongings of the products in Table 1.

Figure 3 Typical GC profile of the liquid product obtained
from the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction (20
mL/min CH4, 20 mL/min NH3, 3.5 s residence time,
and 60 W;
the belongings of A to J are illustrated
in Table 1).

Table 1 Belongings of Peaks
in the GC Profile
in Figure 3
As mentioned in the Introduction section,
NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN
are the two important chemical intermediates in medicine synthesis.
Therefore, although hydrazine, amines, and hydrazones were also produced
by the CH4/NH3 plasma reaction, this paper focused
on the synthesis of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN. However, the standard samples of some other chemicals,
such as B, E, F, I, and J in Table 1, were not available; hence, the chemicals B, E, F, I, and J have
not been analyzed quantitatively. As a result, it is difficult to
calculate the carbon balance and nitrogen balance accurately, as well
as the selectivity of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN. Therefore, the CH4 conversion (F1), the productivities of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN (F2),
and the energy efficiency (F3) have been used
to evaluate the performance of the CH4/NH3 plasma
coupling reaction for the direct synthesis of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN.

3.2 Optimization of Experimental Conditions of
CH4/NH3 Plasma Reaction
Figure 4 shows that the CH4 conversion increased when the CH4/NH3 molar
ratio varied from 1:1 to 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 gradually, at fixed total
feed gas flow (60 mL/min) and input power (60 W). However, the quantity
of converted CH4 first increased and then decreased with
the maximum value at 1:2 CH4/NH3 molar ratio,
as shown in Figure 5. Interestingly, the productivities of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN, shown in Figure 6, exhibited an inverse variation
trend compared with CH4 conversion, and they increased
with an increasing CH4 content (from 1:4 to 1:3, 1:2, and
1:1) in the mixture. At 1:1 CH4/NH3 molar ratio,
the productivities of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN reached 0.40 and 0.23 g·L–1·h–1, respectively, which were higher than
those obtained in the other three cases (Figure 6), whereas the quantity of converted CH4 was nearly the minimum value (Figure 5) compared with that in the other three cases,
indicating that it is more selective to produce NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN when the CH4/NH3 molar ratio was 1:1. It is worth mentioning that
when the content of CH4 was increased further, that is,
the CH4/NH3 molar ratio was 2:1 or higher, some
hydrocarbons, such as C2H6 and C3H8, were dominantly produced in the gas phase, and some
black-colored carbon, such as coke, was deposited on the HVE, which
prevented the discharge. In addition, less liquid products were collected.
These results show that the optimal molar ratio of CH4/NH3 for the synthesis of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN could be 1:1, approximately, and a high CH4/NH3 molar ratio was unfavorable to the production
of liquid nitrogen-containing organic chemicals.

rate 60 mL/min, residence time 2.4 s, 60
W input power, and 90 J/mL specific energy input (SEI)].

Figure 5 Quantity of converted CH4 under varying CH4/NH3 molar ratios.

Figure 6 Productivities of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN under varying CH4/NH3 molar
ratios.

The effect of feed gas residence
time on the synthesis of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN was investigated
by changing the total flow rate with a fixed CH4/NH3 molar ratio (1:1). Figure 7 shows that when the residence time of feedstock increased
from 1.4 to 7.1 s, the CH4 conversion increased gradually.
Nevertheless, the quantity of converted CH4 first increased
sharply and then decreased slowly. As shown in Figure 8, the quantity of converted CH4 reached the highest value at about 2.4 s, and it remained at a high
level when the residence time of feedstock was in the range of 2–4
s. Figure 9 shows that
the productivity of (CH3)2NCN increased gradually
with residence time. However, the productivity of NH2CH2CN presented a parabolic-like curve versus the residence time,
and the highest value appeared at about 3.5 s. Comprehensively, the
optimum residence time seems to be 3.5 s, at which the productivities
of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN reached 0.28 and 0.60 g·L–1·h–1, respectively, with a CH4 conversion of
7.49%.

(60 W input power).

Figure 8 Converted CH4 under varying residence time of feedstock.

Figure 9 Productivities of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN under varying residence time of feedstock.

The influence of SEI, which was
calculated using the input power
divided by the feed gas flow rate, on the synthesis of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN was investigated
at the optimized CH4/NH3 molar ratio (1:1) and
the optimized feedstock residence time (3.5 s). The discharge power
was adjusted through changing the discharge voltage. Figure 10 shows that as the SEI increased
from 45 to 135 J/mL, the CH4 conversion increased significantly
from 3.0 to 10.5%, whereas the productivities of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN first increased and
then decreased, as shown in Figure 11. When the SEI was 105 J/mL, both the productivities
of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN reached their maximum values, 0.46 and 0.82 g·L–1·h–1, respectively. In other words, the optimum
SEI for the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction
to synthesize (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN could be at about 105 J/mL. When the SEI reached 135 J/mL
or higher, some carbonaceous soot was formed adhering to the HVE,
which usually prevented the discharge and quenched the CH4/NH3 plasma reaction, and less liquid products were produced,
demonstrating that high SEI inhibited the production of liquid nitrogen-containing
organic chemicals.

CH4, 20 mL/min NH3, and 3.5 s residence time).

Figure 11 Productivities of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN under varying SEIs
(20 mL/min CH4, 20
mL/min NH3, and 3.5 s residence time).

Under the optimized reaction conditions (1:1 CH4/NH3 molar ratio, 3.5 s residence time, and 105 J/mL SEI),
the
CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction in the SDBD
reactor was carried out for 24 h continuously, and the results are
shown in Figure 12. It can be seen that CH4 conversion remained nearly constant
at about 8.8% during the reaction process. Meanwhile, the productivities
of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN did not vary with the reaction time and were still kept at about
0.46 and 0.82 g·L–1·h–1, respectively. These results indicate that the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction can be carried out relatively stable
in a certain period of time to synthesize liquid nitrogen-containing
organic chemicals, whereas high SEI (more than 135 J/mL) and high
CH4/NH3 molar ratio (more than 2:1) are unfavorable
for the synthesis of liquid nitrogen-containing organic chemicals.

operation (20 mL/min CH4, 20 mL/min NH3, CH4/NH3 = 1:1, 3.5 s residence time, and 105 J/mL
SEI).

3.3 Activation
of CH4 and NH3 in CH4/NH3 DBD Plasma
The CH4/NH3 plasma in
the SDBD reactor has been diagnosed
by an optical emission spectrograph, and the OES profiles are shown
in Figure 13. It can
be seen that three major bands at 564–567, 610–670,
and 720–780 nm were captured. The first band at 564–567
nm is attributed to the decay of NH3* (Schuster’s bands),32 and the later two bands are attributed to the decay of
·NH2* (NH3 α bands).33 In addition,
a line at 656.3 nm appeared in the profile, and it is attributed to
the decay of hydrogen atoms (Hα: 2p2P3/20 → 3d2D3/2).34 These results
indicate that there were abundant NH3* and ·NH2* species in the CH4/NH3 plasma, as well as
a ·H species.

Figure 13 Typical OES of the CH4/NH3 plasma
in the
SDBD reactor (total flow rate 40 mL/min, CH4/NH3 = 1:1, residence time 3.5 s, 60 W input power, and 90 J/mL SEI).

Several tiny lines and bands,
however, were also observed in the
OES profile (300–450 nm in Figure 13). The local amplification of the OES profile
in the range of 300–450 nm is shown in Figure 14, which shows that three lines at 336, 388,
and 431 nm has been captured, and they are attributed to the decays
of ·NH* (A3Π → X3S–),35 ·C≡N (B2∑
→ X2∑),36 and
·CH(A2∑ → X2Π),37 respectively. In addition, numerous N2* bands also appeared
in the OES profiles, and N2 was probably produced by NH3 decomposition.38−40 In other words, the reactive
radical species such as ·NH, ·C≡N, and ·CH existed
in the CH4/NH3 plasma. Morgan studied the activation
of CH4 by the inelastic collision of free electrons and
found that CH4 can be decomposed into ·CH3, ·CH2, and ·CH neutral fragments.41 Therefore, it can be inferred that ·CH3 and ·CH2 species also existed in the NH3/CH4 plasma, and the reason why they have not been
detected is that the emission spectrum of ·CH2 and
·CH3 appears in the infrared region, which cannot
be detected by OES. Therefore, it is highly possible that ·CH3 and ·CH2 reactive species existed in the
NH3/CH4 plasma. From the OES diagnostic results,
it can be concluded that many reactive radical species such as ·CHx (·CH3, ·CH2, and ·CH), ·NHx (·NH2 and ·NH), ·C≡N, and ·H existed in the
NH3/CH4 plasma, and the formation of the products
such as (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN could be attributed to some particular radical reactions between
these reactive species.

Figure 14 Typical OES of the CH4/NH3 plasma (local
amplification of Figure 13).

The generation of ·NHx species
from NH3 molecules in DBD plasma is mainly achieved by
energetic electrons through inelastic collisions. Benarfa et al. studied
the inelastic collision cross section between energetic electrons
and NH3 molecules, and the results show that the electrons
in the energy range of 3–10 eV can excite the ground-state
NH3 into vibrational excited state.42 d’Agostino et al. found that when the vibrational
energy of the vibrationally excited NH3 molecule was higher
than the N–H bond energy (4 eV), NH3 molecules could
break the N–H bond to produce ·NH2 and ·NH
radicals.43 In addition, ground-state NH3 can also be directly dissociated to produce ·NH2 and ·NH radicals through inelastic collision with energetic
electrons, that is, reactions R1–R3 (e* represent the electron with
higher energy than e),35 and their threshold
energy values were 4.0, 5.6, and 8.6 eV, respectively.44 R1   R2   R3  

In DBD plasma, the production of ·CHx species from CH4 molecules by
energetic electrons
could be realized through the following two pathways: the first pathway
is that the ground-state CH4 molecules were excited into
its vibrational states,41 which were further
excited into electronic states S1 (9.6 eV) and S2 (11.7 eV), followed
by producing ·CH3, ·CH2, and ·CH
radicals spontaneously;45,46 the second pathway
is the direct dissociation of CH4 molecules into ·CH3, ·CH2, and ·CH radicals, that is, reactions R4–R6, through inelastic collision with high energy electrons, and their
threshold energy values were 7.5, 8.5, and 15.5 eV, respectively.47,48 De Bie et al. simulated the reaction of CH4 in DBD plasma
using the 1D fluid model, and the results showed that the probability
of producing ·CH3, ·CH2, and ·CH
radicals from CH4 by electrons was 79, 15, and 5%, respectively.49 R4   R5   R6  

The electron energy
range in the DBD plasma is usually 1–10
eV. On the basis of the above-mentioned activation pathways of CH4 and NH3 molecules, it, therefore, can be inferred
that CH4 and NH3 molecules in the CH4/NH3 plasma have been dissociated into ·CHx and ·NHx species,
respectively, by the energetic electrons. The possibility for dissociation
of CH4 and NH3 molecules in the CH4/NH3 plasma, however, could be different, which may be
related to the specific different characters of CH4 and
NH3 molecules, such as bond energies, cross sections with
energetic electrons, and so forth.

3.4 Role
of CH4/NH3 Molar
Ratio
To reveal the effects of the CH4/NH3 mole ratio on the synthesis of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN, the CH4/NH3 plasma with varying molar ratios has been diagnosed using
OES, and the results are shown in Figures 15 and 16. It can be
seen from Figure 15 that the intensities of NH3* and NH2* species decreased gradually when the content
of NH3 decreased from 80 to 50%, corresponding to 1:4 and
1:1 CH4/NH3 molar ratio, respectively. Furthermore,
as shown in Figure 16, the intensity of NH* and N2* species decreased remarkably, whereas the
intensity of CH species increased dramatically. These results indicate
that when the CH4/NH3 molar ratio varied from
1:4 to 1:3, 1:2, and 1:1, the concentration of ·CHx species (·CH, ·CH2, and ·CH3) increased, whereas the concentration of ·NHx (·NH and ·NH2) species decreased
gradually, especially the ·NH species. It is worth noting that
the intensity of ·C≡N species remained nearly constant
regardless of the variation of the CH4/NH3 molar
ratio, which means that the concentration of ·C≡N species
remained nearly stable as the CH4/NH3 molar
ratio was adjusted.

Figure 15 OES profiles of the CH4/NH3 plasma
with varying
CH4/NH3 molar ratios. (Total flow rate 60 mL/min,
residence time 2.4 s, and 60 W input power.)

Figure 16 OES profiles of the CH4/NH3 plasma with varying
CH4/NH3 molar ratios (local amplification of
the range 300–450 nm of Figure 15).

Although the OES intensities of NH3* and ·NH2* decreased gradually with the increase
of the
CH4 content in the CH4/NH3 mixture,
the OES profiles of the CH4/NH3 plasma were
nearly almost dominant by NH3* and ·NH2* species, that is, the intensities of NH3* and ·NH2* species were much
higher than that of ·CHx species
and ·C≡N species, even at 1:1 CH4/NH3 molar ratio. Usually, ·CHx radical
species react with each other to produce hydrocarbons; ·NH2 radical species react with each other to generate hydrazine
(NH2–NH2). In the Experimental
Section, it has been claimed that a little hydrocarbon product
(alkane, olefin, alkyne, or aromatics) was produced, whereas hydrazine
(NH2–NH2) was produced with a considerable
amount (Figure 3 and Table 1), inferring that,
in the CH4/NH3 plasma, the concentration of
·NHx species might be much higher
than that of ·CHx species and ·C≡N
species, notwithstanding that they have not been measured precisely.
In other words, in the CH4/NH3 plasma, the activation
of NH3 could be much easier than that of CH4, which is consistent with the threshold energy values required for
the dissociation of CH4 and NH3 molecules (R1–R6). Therefore, the
rate of the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction
for the synthesis of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN could be determined by the activation of CH4 because it might be slower than that of NH3. That
is, the concentration of ·CHx species
could be the key factor for the synthesis of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN. The increased productivities
of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN with an increasing CH4 content (Figure 6), therefore, could be attributed to the
increase of ·CHx species concentration.
However, too high concentration of ·CHx species may not be helpful to produce liquid nitrogen-containing
organic chemicals. As mentioned in section 3.2, a high CH4/NH3 molar
ratio (2:1 or higher) produced some hydrocarbons, such as C2H6 and C3H8, in the gas phase and
some black-colored carbon in the solid phase, which could be generated
by abundant ·CHx species.

3.5 Role of Residence Time
In the process
of a chemical reaction, the residence time of feedstock, usually,
has a great influence on the product distribution because the product
distribution is generally related with chemical kinetics. That is,
short residence time favors the relatively fast chemical reactions,
whereas long residence time benefits the relatively slow chemical
reactions. As shown in Figure 9, the productivity of (CH3)2NCN increased
gradually with the increasing residence time, whereas the productivity
of NH2CH2CN presented a parabolic-like curve
versus the residence time, and the highest value appeared at 3.5 s
approximately. The GC profiles of the liquid products obtained with
residence times at 1.4, 3.5, and 7.1 s are shown in Figure 17. Those GC profiles may provide
some further information about the variation in the trend of liquid
product distribution versus residence time, although some products
have not been analyzed quantitatively. First, it can be seen from Figure 17 that the intensities
of peaks A (HCN) and C (NH2–NH2) decreased with the increase of residence time, especially
peak C disappeared when the residence time reached 7.1
s. Second, the intensities of peaks D [(CH3)3–C–NH2], E (CH3–NH–N=CH–CH3), F [(CH3)2–C=N–NH–CH3], and G [(CH3)2–N–C≡N]
increased with the increase of residence time. Third, there were an
increasing number of peaks when the residence time was extended (7.1
s). These results indicate that short residence time (1.4 s) favored
the production of HCN and NH2–NH2; then,
at an extended residence time (3.5 and 7.1 s), the produced HCN was
further converted into NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN, whereas the produced NH2–NH2 was transformed into some hydrazones (E, F, and J). That is, with the increase of residence
time, more and more big molecules, such as E (CH3–NH–N=CH–CH3) and F [(CH3)2–C=N–NH–CH3], were produced. Furthermore, these experimental results
seemingly provided us an insight into the kinetics of the CH4/NH3 plasma reaction, that is, the formation of C≡N
and N–N bonds was relatively rapid, whereas the formation of
C–C and C–N bonds was relatively torpid, although the
rate coefficients of these reactions were not measured. In a word,
shorter residence time (1.4 s) favored the generation of small molecules
with less atomic number, such as HCN (A) and NH2–NH2 (C); moderate residence time
(3.5 s) favored the synthesis of molecules with moderate atomic number
such as NH2CH2CN (Figure 9); longer residence time (7.1 s) favored
the production of relatively big molecules with more atoms, such as B, D, E, F, and G.

time
of feedstock (CH4/NH3 = 1:1 and 60 W input power;
the belongings of A to J were illustrated
in Table 1).

3.6 Role
of SEI
Generally, in the plasma
chemical reaction, the higher the SEI, the higher the conversion of
feed gas, as well as the productivity of products. Experimental results,
however, indicate that the conversion of CH4 increased
gradually with the increasing SEI (Figure 10), whereas the productivity productivities
of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN first increased and then decreased (Figure 11). To uncover the effects of SEI on the
CH4/NH3 plasma reaction, the CH4/NH3 plasma with varying SEIs has been diagnosed using an oscilloscope
(monitoring the discharge current and discharge voltage) and OES.

In an atmospheric plasma chemical process, two critical parameters,
such as the electron density and average electron energy, usually
determine the distribution of active species and subsequently influence
the final reaction results. Generally, the variation of the electron
density and average electron energy are synchronous with the discharge
current and discharge voltage, respectively. During the experimental
process, the SEI was modulated by varying the applied discharge voltage.
As shown in Figure 18, it can be seen that a higher SEI corresponded to a higher discharge
voltage. That is, the electric field intensity in the discharge region
increased with the increasing SEI. A higher electric field intensity
means that the electrons could gain a higher kinetic energy at a fixed
accelerating distance. Thus, it can be speculated that the average
electron energy in the CH4/NH3 plasma increased
with the SEI. Meanwhile, the discharge current also increased gradually
with the increase of the SEI (Figure 18), indicating that the electron density increased gradually
with the SEI.

Figure 18 Discharge voltage and discharge current of the CH4/NH3 plasma with varying SEIs (20 mL/min CH4, 20 mL/min
NH3, and 3.5 s residence time).

The OES profiles of the CH4/NH3 plasma
with
varying SEIs are shown in Figures 19 and 20. It can be observed
that the OES intensities of the NH3*, ·NH2, and ·NH species
increased only a little with increasing SEIs, however, that of the
·CH species increased remarkably. These results indicate that,
with the increase of the SEI, both concentrations of ·CHx and ·NHx species increased, but the concentration of ·CHx species increased much faster than that of ·NHx species. The higher concentration of ·CHx and ·NHx species means the faster reaction rate, which may have induced the
higher CH4 conversion, as well as the increasing productivities
of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN. However, why the productivities of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN decreased when the SEI was
higher than 105 J/mL? An experimental phenomenon should be mentioned
that when the SEI reached more than 105 J/mL, some black-colored carbon,
such as coke, formed and deposited on the HVE. The production of the
coke material could be caused by the high concentration of ·CHx species because a higher concentration of
·CHx species means a high probability
to form C–C bond through C–C coupling reactions, which
usually are the fundamental of producing hydrocarbons and even cokes.
Therefore, the production of the coke material might be the direct
reason why the productivities of (CH3)2NCN and
NH2CH2CN decreased when the SEI was higher than
105 J/mL. Another interesting question is that why the concentration
of ·CHx species increased more obviously
than that of ·NHx species with the
increase of the SEI. As shown in R7–R9, the threshold energy values
for the dissociation of the CH4 molecule are much higher
than that of NH3 molecules. The discharge voltage results
indicate that the average electron energy in the CH4/NH3 plasma increased with the increasing SEI. It, therefore,
could be inferred that the higher average electron energy at higher
SEIs favored the activation of CH4 molecules to produce
·CHx radical species. In brief, a
moderate SEI benefits the synthesis of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN, whereas too high SEI leads
to excessive activation of CH4 molecules which can easily
result in the formation of cokes.

3.7 Reaction
Mechanism
As shown in section 3.3, there are
many paths for the generation of ·CHx and ·NHx species from CH4 and NH3 molecules. However, in the CH4/NH3 plasma, there were other two important intermediate species,
·C≡N and NH2–NH2. The ·C≡N
species (or HCN) is vital for the synthesis of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN, whereas the NH2–NH2 species is crucial for the generation
of hydrazone byproducts (E, F, and J).

In the literature,50 several
paths for the formation of C≡N species have been mentioned.
On the basis of the possible reactive species (·CH, ·CH2, ·CH3, ·NH, and ·NH2) in the CH4/NH3 DBD plasma (Figures 13 and 14), there might be three main paths for the formation of ·C≡N
species or HCN, that is, reaction R7–R9. The ·C≡N species may react with other
species (·CH3, ·CH2, ·CH, ·NH2, and ·NH) through some unknown and complicated radical
reactions to form (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN. In addition, the reasons for (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN being produced as the
main products could be related with the kinetics of some radical reactions
between ·CHx, ·NHx, and ·C≡N species and might also be
related with the thermodynamic stability of (CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN molecules. R7   R8   R9  

In the CH4/NH3 DBD plasma,
the OES results
show that there were abundant ·NH2 and ·NH radical
species. However, there were several kinds of hydrazone products containing
an N–N functional group, which indicate that the hydrazine
molecule (NH2–NH2) might take a role
of the reaction intermediate. The reaction results with different
residence times could also prove this point because the intensities
of the hydrazone GC peaks increased versus the residence time; meanwhile,
the intensity of the hydrazine GC peak decreased versus the residence
time or even disappeared at 7.1 s. Generally, the recombination of
·NH species produces N2 and H2 (R10),51 which could be the
origin of N2 and H2 detected by OES (Figures 14, 16, and 20). However, the recombination
of NH2 species usually generates hydrazine, that is, NH2–NH2 (R11).51 In addition, the recombination between ·NH
radical and NH3 molecules also produces NH2–NH2 (R12).52 R10   R11   R12  

On the basis of the
above experimental results and discussions,
a simplified CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction
mechanism has been proposed, as shown in the Scheme 3. First, CH4 and NH3 molecules were dissociated into ·CHx and ·NHx radical species, respectively,
through inelastic collision with energetic electrons of the plasma;
then, at moderate residence time, some simple-structure reaction intermediates
such as HCN and N2H4 species were formed; finally,
with the increase of the residence time, more big molecules, such
as amine, amide, nitrile, cyanamide, hydrazone, and azine, were produced
through some complicated radical reactions between the primary radicals
and reaction intermediates. However, the real CH4/NH3 plasma coupling process should be extremely complicated because
it might involve tens or even hundreds of elementary radical reactions.

Scheme 3 Possible Simplified Mechanism of the CH4/NH3 Plasma Coupling Reaction
4 Conclusions and Perspectives
In summary,
the CH4/NH3 plasma coupling reaction
operated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure synthesized
several kinds of nitrogen-containing organic chemicals, such as amines,
nitriles, cyanamides, and hydrazones, where NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN were produced as the main
products. The feed gas ratio, the feed gas residence time, and the
SEI have significant effects on the CH4/NH3 plasma
coupling reaction, where 1:1 CH4/NH3 molar ratio,
moderate residence time, and moderate SEI favored the synthesis of
NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN.
Under the optimized conditions (CH4/NH3 = 1:1,
3.5 s gas residence time, and 105 J/mL SEI), the productivities of
(CH3)2NCN and NH2CH2CN
reached 0.46 and 0.82 g·L–1·h–1, respectively, with a CH4 conversion of 8.83%. The energy
efficiencies for the synthesis of (CH3)2NCN
and NH2CH2CN, however, were only 15.1 and 26.9
mg/kW·h, respectively, which were still much lower than that
of the industrial process.

The C≡N bond as an important
functional group has irreplaceable
applications in medicine (anticancer drug, carew amine; antitumor
medicine, stubborn azole; antidepressant drug, citalopram; and antipsychotic
medicine, periciazine).53−55 Chemicals containing C≡N bond also have great potential in
the synthesis of organic compounds, such as pyrimidine,56 tetrazene,57 pyrrole,58 amine,59 imine,60 and natural product molecules.61 Therefore, this paper provides a potential carbon–nitrogen
coupling path to form C≡N bond and functional chemicals containing
C≡N bond, which are very significant in medicine and organic
synthesis. The present work is an encouraging beginning, and continuous
attention will be paid to increase the conversion of CH4 and productivities of NH2CH2CN and (CH3)2NCN, as well as the energy efficiency, through
combining the DBD plasma with some particular catalysts.
