Herein,
we describe a bright-red-emitting ovalbumin-protected gold
nanoclusters (OVA–AuNCs) that were prepared and applied as
a luminescent probe for a simple, rapid, and highly sensitive determination
of cyanide ions (CN– ions) based on an emission
quenching and colorimetric method. Initially, an intense red-emissive
fluorescence of the OVA–AuNCs successfully disappeared upon
the addition of CN– ions. The resultant emission-quenching
process involved CN– ions etching the OVA–AuNC
surface, which produced AuCN2– complexes
in the presence of ambient oxygen. Under optimized experimental conditions,
the relative emission intensity is inversely relative to CN– ion concentrations ranging from 5.00 × 10–7 to 75.00 × 10–7 mol/L with a linear correlation
coefficient of 0.9932. Furthermore, OVA–AuNC-based optical
detection systems on both colorimetric and fluorometric assays were
tested, which expose highly sensitive and specific determination of
CN– ions, and it is easily visualized by the naked
eye (day light and UV light). Because of the distinct Elsner reaction
between Au atoms of OVA–AuNCs and CN– ions,
the recent nanoprobe offered ultrasensitivity and good selectivity
with the lowest limit of detection value of 68.00 × 10–9 mol/L. In addition, this fluorescence “turn-off” CN– ion detection method was executed in real water samples.
The demonstrated route of OVA–AuNC preparation is extremely
easy and quick, making the proposed selective and sensitive CN– ion sensing assay based on the fluorescence response
of the OVA–AuNCs for numerous practical applications.

1 Introduction
In
recent decades, frequent attempts were allotted for the progress
of specific chemosensors for the determination of various anions.
Among them, chemosensors for cyanide ion (CN– ions)
quantifications are mainly of considerable interest owing to environment,
security, and public health concerns.1 Nowadays,
in the industry, a bulky amount of cyanide composites is manufactured
and used. For example, CN– ions are utilized in
a lot of chemical methods, namely, plastics manufacturing, electroplating,
tanning, metallurgy, and gold and silver extraction.1−3 Hence, CN– is a usually encountered pollutant
in soil and water. Generally, CN– is a very poisonous
agent ensuing in metabolic asphyxiation; extremely low levels of CN– groups are a deadly poison to people, which is caused
by its tendency to connect with the ferric atom of the hemoglobin
component consequentially  the inhibition of cytotoxic hypoxia.
Furthermore, anaerobic metabolisms provoked by CN– ions are directed to accretion of lactates in the human blood. Mutual
consequences of lactate acidosis and hypoxia trouble the vital nervy
arrangement, ensuing in respiratory arrest and fatality.4−7 On account of the eminent lethality in a specific type of CN– ions, the tolerable amounts of CN– ions in soil and water are normally extremely low. As stated by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and World
Health Organization (WHO), the highest tolerable amounts of CN– ions in drinkable water are 200 μg/L and 1.90
× 10–6 mol/L, respectively.8,9 Because
of the intense lethal poisonous nature of CN– ions,
from the ecological point of view, attracting attention using simplistic
and highly sensitive analytical tactics for CN– ion
sensing is very necessary.

The broad occurrence and acute lethal
poisonous nature of CN– ions, several conservative
recognition approaches,
including electrochemical, titrimetric, chromatography, chemiluminescence,
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and other techniques, were demonstrated
for CN– ions’ quantitative testing.10−15 On the other hand, as an outcome of these analytical methods are
dependent on instrument facility, low sensitivity, time-consuming
characteristics with high limit of detection (LOD) values, high cost,
and normally multifaceted. Advanced development of the tactics for
rapid and trace-level determination of CN– ions
is still anticipated. CN– ions are familiar for
the ability to disperse in metals, such as gold and silver, in the
existence of oxygen, leading to the development of water-soluble metal–CN
compounds via the etching process.16

In recent times, gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) infatuated discrete
physiochemical qualities that made them outstanding colorimetric assays
for the invention of new chemo-biosensors.17−20 Liu et al. proposed a bovine
serum albumin-functionalized AuNCs, and Dong et al. reported lysozyme-stabilized
AuNCs for highly selective sensing of CN– ions based
on an etching-tempted emission quenching method.19,20 Encouraged by the reality that specific and highly sensitive determination
of CN– ions is obtained via the CN– ion-etching process affected emission quenching of AuNCs.21 In this sense, we have chosen highly fluorescent
AuNCs which are a perfect aspirant for the quantification of CN– ions. Furthermore, AuNCs are produced through a simple
wet chemical method, high fluorescence quantum yield, large Stokes
shift, good photostability, and excellent biocompatibility, which
demonstrate a distinctive chance to optimize the sensing of CN– ions in ways impracticable in other usual detection
methods.22

For the synthesis of AuNCs,
amino acids, biomolecules, and polymers
that operate as functionalizing and reducing reagents are essential
for the synthesis of stable and highly luminescent AuNCs.18 Biologically important moieties, including proteins
and peptides, are employed as structure-clear scaffolds to facilitate
the growth and nucleation of AuNCs.18−20 On this background,
we have chosen easily available and very cheap ovalbumin (OVA) protein
as a surface-stabilizing agent for the preparation of AuNCs. OVA is
an N-linked glycoprotein originated from chicken egg white, and it
contains 385 amino acid residues. It is a sturdy nominee for the preparation
of protein-functionalized AuNCs because OVA holds 6 cysteine- and
10 tyrosine-rich amino acid residues, 4 free thiol groups (−SH),
1 internal disulfide bond (S–S) and serpinlike structure.23−27 During the synthesis of AuNCs, OVA molecules act both as a stabilizing
agent and as a reducing agent, which is similar to bovine serum albumin,
and maintaining the physical temperature and alkaline conditions is
compulsory.25 In addition, OVA was successfully
utilized as a surface-functionalizing agent for the preparation of
silver and gold nanoparticles.28 OVA-stabilized
Au-based nanomaterials are applied in various fields such as sensing23,29 and bioimaging30 studies.

In this
paper, water-soluble, highly red-emissive OVA-conjugated
AuNCs were effectively prepared and established for the fluorometric
and colorimetric sensing of CN– ions in water medium
for the first time. Morphological properties and photophysical behaviors
of OVA-stabilized AuNCs were characterized by appropriate techniques.
Upon the addition of CN– ions to OVA–AuNCs,
the fluorescence intensity of OVA–AuNCs is quickly and linearly
reduced, whereas other common interfering ions did not affect the
fluorescence intensity. OVA–AuNCs demonstrate more specificity
for CN– ions against the other common interfering
anions. The achieved superb selectivity of CN– ions
is due to the fine etching of the OVA-stabilized AuNC surface and
after decay of the AuNCs through the growth of Au–CN complex,
leading to the emission quenching of OVA–AuNCs. An additional
exciting attribute of the proposed approach is the double visual signal
alteration, OVA–AuNCs in the presence of CN– ions, as well the emission quenching; the color of the AuNC colloidal
solution under day light and ultraviolet (UV) lamp also faded. The
twin visual color change in one sensing methodology applied for the
identification of CN– ions both colorimetrically
and fluorometrically offers a further rectification of possible falsified
signals in a single modal system. In addition, this fluorescence “turn-off”
CN– ions detection method was executed for real-water
samples.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis,
Characterization, and Stability
of OVA–AuNCs
To achieve the highly fluorescent and
stable OVA–AuNCs, three significant reaction factors, such
as the weight of the OVA, effect of pH on the reaction mixture, and
reaction time, were investigated, and the corresponding results are
displayed in Figure S1. As depicted in Figure S1a, with the increasing OVA content from
2.5 to 10 mg mL–1, the emission intensity of OVA–AuNCs
is increased. Once exceeding the addition of 10 mg mL–1, the emission intensity of OVA–AuNCs is decreased because
free OVA molecules are adsorbed on the surface of AuNCs, which affects
the fluorescence nature of OVA–AuNCs. Therefore, we chose 10
mg mL–1 as a characteristic amount of our AuNCs
synthetic procedure. The effect of the reaction time of AuNCs synthesis,
the value emission intensity enhanced with the rise in time from 1
to 12 h, and the maximum emission intensity were obtained at 12 h
reaction time (Figure S1b). It was designated
that Au3+ was reduced to Au0 by tyrosine residues
of OVA protein, and AuNCs were grown in situ. Moreover, these emission
spectral observations demonstrated that the emission intensity of
OVA–AuNCs diminished after 12 h. Hence, we set the reaction
time to the synthesis of highly fluorescent AuNCs for 12 h. Furthermore,
it is essential to manage the end point by examining the pH value
of the reaction mixture. It can be noted from Figure S1c that OVA–AuNCs show that the emission intensity
appeared only in a basic condition at a pH value above 9, and the
highest emission intensity was observed at a pH value of 12. Thus,
the value of pH = 12 was preferred as the most favorable synthetic
condition of AuNCs. The resultant OVA–AuNCs are highly red
emissive in nature. However, the luminescence mechanism and the atomic
structure of these AuNCs are still unidentified after some years of
growth. Very recently, Zhang et al. reported the results for luminescent
features, atomic structure, and biomolecular self-assembly of AuNCs
functionalized by the bulky globular protein and bovine serum albumin.31 Significantly, such AuNCs are in a rigidified
state inside the protein scaffold, presenting a description for their
highly fluorescent nature.31 During the
synthesis of AuNCs, OVA act both as a  stabilizing agent and
as a reducing agent; this is analogous to the bovine serum albumin.32 Therefore, in the present study, it is believed
that AuNCs are formed within the OVA protein because the collected
OVA–AuNCs are highly emissive in nature.

An extremely
bright-red-fluorescent OVA–AuNCs were achieved through a one-pot,
“green” synthetic approach. Absorption and emission
spectra of OVA–AuNCs are given in Figure S2. As visualized in Figure S2,
OVA–AuNCs show no noticeable surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
peak in the range of 500 to 535 nm, representing the growth of AuNCs
instead of large-sized Au nanoparticles. Xie et al. previously reported
that the absence of the SPR band in the protein-stabilized AuNCs is
attributed to the creation of NCs within the protein template.33 The inset photographic images of Figure 1 demonstrate that the OVA–AuNCs
colloidal dispersion is a clear yellowish brown under ambient light
and show a highly intense red fluorescence under a UV lamp (365 nm).
Furthermore, the collected OVA–AuNCs show bright intense red
fluorescence with an emission peak at 650 nm upon the excitation source
at 390 nm and a large Stokes shift about 260 nm, which are clear benefits
for biosensing and bioimaging applications (Figure 1). The excitation wavelength at 390 nm of
OVA–AuNCs is further verified by excitation spectral outcomes
(Figure 1). Excellent
emission features of the collected OVA–AuNCs fascinated our
interest. Therefore, the fluorescence quantum yield (ϕ) of OVA–AuNCs
was determined in this study. The calculated ϕ value of OVA–AuNCs
was 10.34%. The obtained ϕ value has a fairly good accordance
with the previously reported OVA-stabilized AuNCs.23 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM)
analysis was employed to recognize the size and morphology of the
collected OVA–AuNCs, and the resultant HR-TEM image with the
corresponding statistical diagram are displayed in Figure 2. The HR-TEM image (Figure 2a) points out that
OVA–AuNCs were well-dispersed and almost spherical in shape
with a mean diameter of about 2.5 ± 0.32 nm (Figure 2b). To know the colloidal stability
of OVA–AuNCs, the zeta potential analysis was measured and
provided in Figure S3. The zeta potential
value of OVA–AuNCs found as −22.4 mV clearly reveals
the high colloidal stability of OVA–AuNCs.

shows photographs of the color of the OVA–AuNCs under day light
(i) and UV light (ii).

of OVA–AuNCs.

Stability is regularly seen as an imperative marker of the
feasibility
of nanosized materials. Therefore, photostability and stability of
the resultant OVA–AuNCs were examined in this study. The photostability
of OVA–AuNCs was tested under nonstop irradiation of OVA–AuNCs
with UV light for 120 min. It can be seen from Figure S4a that there is no apparent alteration in the emission
intensity viewed, which clearly points out the excellent photostability
of OVA–AuNCs. The stability of OVA–AuNCs in water medium
at pH 12 was evaluated. Emission features of OVA–AuNCs were
recorded periodically during 25 days, and the obtained observations
are given in Figure S4b. As viewed in Figure S4b, it is important to state that the
colloidal nature and optical properties are the same after 20 days
storage of the nanoprobe in the refrigerator at 4 °C. After 20
days storage, the colloidal nature and emission characteristics of
OVA–AuNCs were changed because of aggregation or flocculation.

2.2 Fluorescence Detection of CN– Ions
Using OVA–AuNCs
The interaction time of OVA–AuNCs
toward CN– ions was also evaluated, and the result
is depicted in Figure S5a. As shown in Figure S5a, when CN– ions were
mixed into OVA–AuNCs colloidal solution, the values of emission
intensity decreased regularly at the early period and then attained
a maximum emission quenching in 10 min, demonstrating that the interaction
between OVA–AuNCs and CN– ions attained equilibrium.
Ultimately, 10 min is determined to be the best interaction period
throughout all the emission titration experiments. Furthermore, the
value of pH is a main factor for the good performance of CN– ions sensing by OVA–AuNCs. In recent times, the fluorescence
probe has a highly fluorescent nature in alkaline conditions because
the effect of pH on OVA–AuNCs with CN– ions
was studied in the range of pH from 9 to 12 and is displayed in Figure S5b. The maximum emission quenching of
OVA–AuNCs with CN– ions was reached at the
value of pH about 11 (Figure S5b). Moreover,
free CN– ions form a feeble acid and hence can subsist
in dual forms in a solution medium, such as hydrocyanic acid (HCN)
and CN– ions.34 When
pH > pKa + 1, for example, pH >
10.36,
the CN– ion form is major, and when pH < pKa – 1, for example, pH < 8.36, the
HCN form becomes important because the value of pKa is 9.36. Hence, pH 11 was selected as the most appropriate
pH, and this pH was employed in other investigations.

The utility
of the resultant OVA–AuNCs was appraised for quantification
of trace amounts of CN– ions in a water medium.
Under the most favorable experimental settings, the effects of the
incremental amounts of CN– ions on the emission
intensity changes of the OVA–AuNCs were tested. The emission
spectral response of OVA–AuNCs with the incremental amounts
of CN– ions is depicted in Figure 3. It can be noted from Figure 3 that when aliquots of CN– ion aqueous solution were successively mixed into the OVA–AuNCs,
the emission intensity of OVA–AuNCs is reduced steadily with
a distinctive alteration (Figure 3) in the emission spectral profile (hypsochromic shift,
peak position, and shape). OVA–AuNCs show a bright-red-fluorescence
nature which is highly sensitive to CN– ions concentration
(inset of Figure 3).
The sensitivity of this nanoprobe toward CN– ions
is caused by the strong interaction between the CN– ions and Au atoms on the NC surface, which demonstrates the high
effectiveness in the emission quenching of OVA–AuNCs. Furthermore,
it is reasonable that CN– ions entirely reduce the
emission features of OVA–AuNCs via the etching of Au atoms
from the NC surface and decayed the highly red-emissive AuNCs into
small fragments and leads to the formation of nonemissive AuCN2– complexes, which is shown in Scheme 1. Similar kinds of
observations have been previously reported in the case of various
molecule-functionalized Au nanomaterials.19,20,35,36 Emission quenching
results were quantitatively subjected to the traditional Stern–Volmer
equation (eq 1)37−40 1  where F and F0 denote the emission intensities of the OVA–AuNCs
with and without the addition of CN– ions, [Q] is
the concentration of CN– ions, and Ksv is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant. The
Stern–Volmer plot of emission quenching of OVA–AuNCs
versus the concentration of CN– ions is given in Figure S6. Unambiguously, emission quenching
is directly connected to the quantity of CN– ions
mixed into the OVA–AuNC colloidal solution. From the slope
of the linear Stern–Volmer plot (Figure S6), the Ksv value is estimated
to be 9.74 × 105 mol–1 dm3, which reveals the strong emission quenching of OVA–AuNCs
with CN– ions (Figure S6).

of CN– Ions and OVA–AuNCs
2.3 Mechanistic Studies for
Fluorescence-Based
Sensing Approach
AuNCs consisting of few to tens of atoms
are smaller than 2 nm in the average size, which is close to the Fermi
wavelength of an electron. Thespatial internment for free of charge
electrons in AuNCs results in size-tunable and distinct electronic
conversions; hence, it is similar to the molecular features, for instance
fluorescence.41 Fascinatingly, the emission
activities of AuNCs are extremely size-dependent, which stimulated
us to believe whether the present bright-red-emitting OVA–AuNCs
are prospective appliance in the quantification of CN– ions. Upon the addition of CN– ions to OVA–AuNCs,
the CN– ions etched the AuNCs surface, and it is
responsible for the emission quenching (97%). To get further insight
into the emission quenching mechanism, the fluorescence lifetime decay
studies of OVA–AuNCs before and after the addition of CN– ions were examined, and the resultant lifetime profiles
are presented in Figure 4. The typical fluorescence lifetime of OVA–AuNCs alone is
2.32 ns, and it has three components: 1.03 ns (24%), 2.23 (58%), and
4.47 ns (17%). Furthermore, the estimated lifetime value is substituted
into the following relation,37−40Kq = Ksv/τ, and the value of emission quenching constant
(Kq) was computed as 4.20 × 1014 dm3 mol–1 s–1. It has been familiar that for a ground-state complex formation
process, the value of Kq is larger than
the highest scattering collision quenching constant (2.00 × 1010 dm3 mol–1 s–1).31 For OVA–AuNCs with CN– ions, the higher value of Kq clearly indicates that the reducing emission intensity was not inspired
by a dynamic process because it is attributed to the ground-state
formation via a static quenching mechanism. Furthermore, soon after
the coordination of CN– ions to OVA–AuNCs,
the mean fluorescence lifetime of OVA–AuNCs with CN– ions is slightly reduced from 2.32 to 2.08 ns and still consists
of three components: 1.03 ns (30%), 2.23 ns (58%), and 4.15 ns (13%).
The little reducing average lifetime value clearly revealed that CN– ions lead to the ground-state complex formation via
a static quenching process rather than a collisional quenching process.
A similar type of fluorescence lifetime spectral profile has been
reported in the case of sulfide ion detection by lysozyme-stabilized
AgNCs.42

Figure 5 HR-TEM image (a) and corresponding statistical
diagram (b) of OVA–AuNCs
with 50.00 × 10–7 mol/L concentrations of CN– ions.

To substantiate the lifetime analysis, the absorption spectral
characteristic of OVA–AuNCs with the incremental addition of
CN– ions was examined, and the collected data are
displayed in Figure S7. Figure S7 demonstrates that the absorption peak of OVA–AuNCs
is regularly decreased with the increasing amount of CN– ions, simultaneously changing the color of the solution from yellowish
brown to colorless. The resultant significant absorption spectral
changes suggested that CN– ions etched the OVA–AuNCs
surface, which are fairly in accordance with the static quenching
mechanism. Furthermore, circular dichroism (CD) signal changes of
OVA–AuNCs with and without CN– ions are measured
and provided in Figure S8. As visualized
in Figure S8, OVA–AuNCs did not
exhibit a CD spectrum at 208 and 222 nm, which designates that a secondary
structural change owing to the contribution of OVA took place in the
formation of OVA–AuNCs. A similar type of OVA-stabilized AuNPs
has been previously reported.43 Obvious
changes of the CD spectrum of OVA–AuNCs occurred after the
addition of CN– ions, which suggested that CN– ions etching the OVA–AuNCs led to formation
of metal–cyanide complexes. Upon etching by CN– ions, OVA–AuNCs became smaller, which is expected to lessen
the surface offered for the adsorption of OVA. Thus, OVA protein molecules
may slowly desorb from the surface of OVA–AuNCs which then
lead to recover the CD spectral signal at 208 and 222 nm of OVA (Figure S8). In addition, CN– ions etching the OVA–AuNC surface were further identified
by HR-TEM analysis and are shown in Figure 5. As noted in Figure 5, OVA–AuNCs after the addition of
CN– ions show that the average sizes of OVA–AuNCs
varied from 2.1 ± 0.3 to 1.3 ± 0.4 nm, which clearly indicates
that CN– ions etch the Au atom of OVA–AuNCs.
A similar type of the HR-TEM result has been reported in the case
of AuNPs in the presence of CN– ions.21,35 Optical properties of OVA–AuNCs were significantly dependent
on the concentration of CN– ions. The CN– ion-etching process induced emission quenching of OVA–AuNCs
recognized from the fluorescence lifetime, absorption, and CD spectral
outcomes.

2.4 Selectivity of the Present Approach
Along with the prerequisite for sensitivity, superb specificity is
also a crucial characteristic for nanoprobes applied in analytical
purposes. To inspect the specificity of the present approach for the
OVA–AuNC-based fluorescence sensing of CN– ions, the emission spectral changes of OVA–AuNCs after the
addition of different appropriate anions were appraised under optimum
conditions, and typical outcomes are given in Figure 6. As illustrated in Figure 6, environmentally relevant probable interfering
anions showed a weak interference to CN– ion quantification
and did not lead to any obvious fluorescence spectral changes at other
anions, which makes a good selective determination of CN– ions. Selective and well-built CN–Au interactions offered
superb selectivity for the recent OVA–AuNCs toward CN– ions over other relevant anions. Furthermore, the present method
exhibits that the selectivity was further visualized by the naked
eye. The colorimetric nature of OVA–AuNCs under day light and
UV light was investigated, and the corresponding photographs are displayed
in the inset of Figure 6. The inset of Figure 6a demonstrates that the brownish yellow color of the OVA–AuNC
colloidal solution was only obliterated by CN– ions,
whereas no remarkable colorimetric alterations were monitored in the
existence of the various probable interfering anions. Similarly, the
bright-red-emissive feature of OVA–AuNCs was not altered by
various interfering anions, and CN– ions only led
to changes from red to a slight blue color emission of OVA–AuNCs
(inset of Figure 6b).
In addition, the recent high-intense red-emitting OVA–AuNCs
were extremely specific in the occurrence of different anions even
at 10-fold high concentrations that of CN– ions,
which assists the recognition of the proposed nanoprobe for illustrations
in different analytical applications. Several anions were treated
to OVA–AuNCs; only distinctive color change of CN– ions was noted and easily identified by naked eyes.

concentrations of common interfering anions and 75.00 × 10–7 mol/L of CN– ions. Inset: Corresponding
photographs under day light (a) and UV light (b).

2.5 Sensing Performance
According to
the emission-quenching experiments, CN– ions concentrations
were calculated. The calibration curve plotted between the emission
intensities and different concentrations of CN– ions
and the resultant calibration curve are displayed in Figure 7. As depicted in Figure 7, the calibration curve exhibits
a well-linear regression of emission intensity on CN– ion concentrations ranging from 5.00 × 10–7 to 75.00 × 10–7 mol/L with a linear correlation
coefficient value (R) of 0.9932. The lowest LOD of
OVA–AuNCs at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 for CN– ions was calculated as 68.00 × 10–9 mol/L,
which was much less than the highest tolerable amount of CN– ions (1.90 × 10–6 mol/L) in drinkable water,
which is allowed by the WHO.9 This means
that in this, the OVA–AuNCs-based fluorescent approach is highly
sensitive and sufficient to examine CN– ion concentrations
in drinkable water. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was 2.05%
for five repeated experiments, signifying the fine repeatability of
the present fluorescent approach. The analytical performance of OVA–AuNC-based
CN– ion-sensing fluorescence approach compared with
that of previously reported other fluorescence methods19−22,34,36,44 for CN– ions is listed
in Table S1. It can be observed from Table S1 that the current methodology had an
acceptable sensitivity with simple experimental procetures and no
need for complicated apparatus. Furthermore, compared to the
lysozyme and bovine-serum-stabilized AuNC-based CN– ion detection methods,20,21 the proposed method
has several outstanding advantages, including wide linear range, lowest
LOD value, and comparatively low-cost protein OVA that is used as
a surface-functionalizing agent for the synthesis of AuNCs. In addition,
this recent approach is highly sensitive and specific for CN– ions detection with eco-friendly and easy-handling procedures.

2.6 Analytical
Applications
As we recognize,
unintentional CN– ions liberated from industrialized
progressions and inappropriate waste discharge are a reason for brutal
pollution of different water sources. Therefore, it is incredibly
significant to construct a proper systematic approach to detect the
CN– ions in ecological water samples. To assess
whether the OVA–AuNCs-based fluorescent-sensing approach demonstrated
here is suitable to ecosystems, natural water samples, such as tap
water, drinking water, and dam water samples, were taken from our
department, Bharathiar University, and Siruvani dam and monitored
by the recent CN– ion detection assay. Under optimum
reaction conditions, 0.1 mL of real-water samples was mixed into the
reaction mixture, and the emission spectral response was monitored.
No substantial alterations in the emission intensity were noted, which
illustrates that the level of CN– ions in the natural
water samples was lower than the LOD of the recommended analytical
approach. However, subsequent to mixing the real water with CN– ions, a noteworthy reduction in the emission intensity
was examined. Three levels of CN– ions concentrations
of 25, 50, and 75.00 × 10–7 mol/L were executed
for all samples to estimate the recovery (%), and the calculated recoveries
(n = 3) are tabulated in Table 1. A standard addition technique was applied
to compute the amount of CN– ions in the CN– ion-mixed water samples. From Table 1, the calculated concentration in CN– ions-added water samples by the current work was in
fine concordance with the CN– ions spiked, together
with reasonable recoveries of 97.75–99.44%. These outcomes
illustrate that the recent simple fluorescent-based sensor has an
immense prospective for quantitative methods of CN– ions levels in natural samples. It is worth noting that numerous
merits of the proposed fluorescent approach make it particularly effective
for the quantification of CN– ions, including the
fact that this nanoprobe was constructed with an effortless, eco-friendly
“green” synthetic method without any harmful organic
solvents; emission features of AuNCs are extremely concentration-dependent
to CN– ions etching, and Au is a chemically stable
metal in the periodic table; also, only some anions react with it,
except CN– ions, which permits that high specificity
and sensitivity toward CN– ions were attained. Significantly,
the present nanoprobe was working directly in water medium, hence
facilitating the examination of natural water samples.

3 Conclusions
To summarize
all, synthesis of OVA-protected AuNCs was performed
by a simple eco-friendly “green” synthetic route and
comprises the ability to sensitively and selectively determine CN– ions in 100% water medium. With the consecutive addition
of CN– ions to OVA–AuNCs, emission intensities
of OVA–AuNCs were reduced via a static quenching mechanism
which reveals the very sensitive determination of CN– ions. The sensing method is found on the capability of CN– ions etching the OVA–AuNCs surface, triggering the reducing
emission features of AuNCs. Moreover, both colorimetric and fluorometric
detection of CN– ions by OVA–AuNCs are easily
monitored by the naked eye (day light and UV light). Because of the
distinctive (Elsner reaction) strong CN–Au attraction, the
recent luminous OVA–AuNCs illustrated greater selectivity for
CN– ions over different potential interfering anions.
Particularly, the present nanoprobe allowed the highly specific and
ultrasensitive detection of CN– ions with an estimated
LOD value of 68 × 10–9 mol/L, which is much
lesser than the highest permissible limit of CN– ions (1.90 × 10–6 mol/L) in drinkable water
mandated by the WHO. Furthermore, these analytical experiments extended
for some real-water samples spiked with CN– ions
established the prospective sensible applications of the current nanoprobe
in real-water samples. The developed OVA–AuNCs-based CN– ion fluorescence detection system is trouble-free,
fast, sensitive, low-priced, and without any harmful organic solvent.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Hydrogen
tetrachloroaurate(III)
trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) was obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), OVA, and sodium cyanide
(NaCN) were collected from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd., India. All reagent
chemicals were of as-minimum analytical reagent grade and used as
received. Double distilled water was utilized throughout investigation.

4.2 Synthesis of OVA-Stabilized AuNCs (OVA–AuNCs)
OVA–AuNCs were synthesized by the following procedure. Initially,
2 mL of OVA solution (10 mg mL–1) was mixed with
2 mL of HAuCl4 (4.00 × 10–3 mol/L)
solution under magnetic stirring at room temperature. After 5 min,
0.2 mL of NaOH (1.00 mol/L) was added into the reaction mixture to
adjust the alkaline pH ≈ 11–12. Then, the reaction mixture
was permitted to progress under stirring for 12 h at 37 °C, whereas,
the color of the solution changes from whitish yellow to yellowish
brown, proposing that the growth of AuNCs and the obtained OVA–AuNCs
were treated to membrane dialysis for the purification process. The
resultant OVA–AuNCs were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C
for further use.

4.3 Instruments
Fluorescence
spectral
data were monitored by a JASCO FP-8500 spectrophotometer attached
with 150-W xenon light as an excitation resource. A double-beam JASCO
V-630 UV–visible spectrophotometer was applied for the recording
of the absorption spectral analysis. HR-TEM images were achieved on
JEOL JEM 2100 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For HR-TEM analysis,
the samples were equipped by dipping OVA–AuNCs on the carbon-coated
copper grid. The sample was investigated by HR-TEM images after drying.
Time-resolved fluorescence decay investigation was achieved on a HORIBA
Scientific time-correlated single-photon counting unit equipped with
a 390 nm light source as an excitation. CD studies were tracked in
the range from 200 to 260 nm with a scan speed of 50 nm min–1 using a JASCO-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a quartz cuvette
of 0.1 cm path length.

4.4 Detection Procedure for
CN– Ions
NaCN solution was freshly prepared
prior to use. For
the fluorescence sensing of CN– ions, 0.5 mL of
OVA–AuNC colloidal solution and different concentrations of
CN– ions were placed in a series of 5 mL standard
measuring flask (SMF). Then, the reaction mixture was made upto the
mark of SMF using doubly distilled water, thoroughly shaken well,
and allowed for a 10 min equilibration time. Finally, emission spectra
were examined by an excitation source at 390 nm, and values of emission
intensities at the emission signal at 650 nm were plotted against
the CN– ion concentration. Selectivity experiments
for CN– ions were performed by the addition of other
common ions rather than CN– ions using the same
procedure. In addition, photographs of OVA–AuNCs in the absence
and presence of various potential interfering ions were achieved under
day light and UV light.

4.5 Detection of CN– Ions in
Real-Water Samples
Real-water samples (tap water, drinking
water, and dam water) were taken from our department, Bharathiar University,
and Siruvani dam and were focused to the quantification of the spiked
amount of CN– ions using OVA–AuNCs as a fluorescence
nanoprobe. Real–sampling-analysis-correlated procedures were
as similar as those for standard sample solutions. All the measurements
were carried out minimum three times.
