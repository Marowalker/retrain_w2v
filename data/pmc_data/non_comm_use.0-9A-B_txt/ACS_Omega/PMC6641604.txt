Bringing
together the concepts of self-immolative linkers and chemiluminogen
dioxetane modules, a chemiluminescence-based sensor for fluoride with
signal amplification is presented. Signal amplification is obtained
by triggering two chemiluminescence events for each reacting fluoride
ion that in turn releases two fluoride ions for each ion. As expected,
the chemiluminescence signal starts to rise following an induction
period. In addition to the analytical potential, this chemical system
is also of interest as a demonstration of positive feedback loop character.

Introduction
Molecular agents that
respond to chemical species of interest,
with externally observable/detectable responses proved to be immensely
useful. In addition, they served as a proving ground for testing a
number of photophysical concepts. Fluoride ion is an important species
as an analytical target as it is implicated in certain disease states.1 As a chemosensing target, it is challenging owing
to its very strong hydrogen bonding capability in aqueous solution,
which deactivates it toward additional interactions.

There are
a number of strategies used for sensing fluoride ions
in polar solvents.2 Most of them are reaction-based.
High affinity of fluoride ions for silicon centers in silyl groups
is often exploited in such chemosensor designs. tert-Butyldimethylsilyl is such a group, which would leave alkoxy or
phenoxy units following the reaction with fluoride ions.3 In fact, the smooth reactivity under very mild
conditions makes these groups very useful as protecting groups for
phenols, alcohols, and amines.4

On
the other hand, self-immolative linkers were shown to be very
valuable in drug release.5 Typically, a
quinone methide rearrangement leads to the cleavage of a critical
bond, releasing an active agent or initiating further breakdown in
the molecular structure.6 Single trigger
may initiate one (1,4) or multiple (1,4; 1,2; and 1,6) quinone methide
reactions.

In order to make use of fluoride-initiated self-immolative
breakdown
of the linker for chemiluminescence signaling, we made use of sterically
stabilized adamantyl dioxetane units as the chemiluminogen unit.7 Chemical triggering of chemiluminescence using
this particular module is well-documented in the literature.8 Final addition to our design (Scheme 1) was the strategic placement
of the protected 4-difluoromethylaniline module: the attachment was
made in the form of a carbamate at the para-position to the silyloxy
substituent.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of a Chemiluminescent Signal Amplifier 10
As an external source
of fluoride is introduced, a number of chemical
reactions are expected to be triggered in accord with this design:
the initial removal of the silyl group, which leads to 1,2- and 1,6-quinone
methide reactions that would be then coupled to carbonate and carbamate
decompositions, generating chemiluminescence as a result of dioxetane
ring opening, and the 1,4-quinone methide reaction results in the
release of unstable p-difluoromethylaniline-derived
species, which eventually ejects two fluoride ions. Thus, signal amplification
can be achieved by a positive feedback loop or autoinduction.

Results
and Discussion
The synthesis scheme is shown in Scheme 1. p-Hydroxybenzoate ester 1 can be converted into bishydroxymethyl-substituted
compound 2. All three hydroxyl functionalities were then
protected
with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSCl).
Diisobutyl aluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) reduction of the ester yields
benzylic alcohol 4. Curtius rearrangement9 of acyl azide obtained from 4-(difluoromethyl)-benzoic
acid, by the reaction with SOCl2, followed by NaN3, yields an isocyanate that generates the carbamate 5 on reaction with the benzylic alcohol 4. Mild deprotection
conditions with p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) remove
benzylic protections while keeping the silylated phenol group untouched
(6). p-Nitrophenylchloroformate activation
yields a reactive carbonate 7. This compound was then
reacted with the adamantyl derivative 8(2d) to yield the penultimate compound 9 that was
then converted into stable dioxetane that is the target compound 10, by singlet oxygen addition to the electron-rich double
bond.

Following spectroscopic characterization, our first investigation
was the titration of the chemiluminescence response (Figure 1) and the demonstration of
selectivity of the response (Figure 2). It is clear that micromolar concentrations of fluoride
ions lead to clear luminescence emission with a peak at 470 nm.

of increasing F– concentrations.
Probe concentration is 200 μM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
[Chemiluminescence intensities were recorded 10 s after the addition
of tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF)].

Figure 2 Top: Chemiluminescence spectra of compound 10 upon
the addition of 1.0 equiv of I–, Br–, Cl–, SCN–, CN–, AcO–, H2PO4–, HSO4–, NO3–, and F–, and the probe concentration is 200 μM
in DMSO. (Chemiluminescence spectra were recorded 10 s after the addition
of TBAF). Bottom: The bar graph representing intensity enhancement
over the background signal.

As expected, the chemiluminescence signal is highly selective.
Only the other response at the same concentration of the anions was
observed with CN– ions, which was considerably weaker
compared to the fluoride response. The design of the probe (Figure 3) is such that for
every fluoride ion that reacts to remove the silyl protecting group
will lead to a cascade of events that would result in triggering two
chemiluminescence events and generate two fluoride ions as a result
of 4-(difluoromethyl)aniline hydrolysis.

Figure 3 Amplification of fluoride
signal, resulting in faster enhanced
chemiluminescence signal.

Considering the number of independent steps involved in signal
generation, actual kinetics of the process can be complicated.

Depending on the initial concentration of the fluoride ions, the
chemiluminescence signal at all initial concentrations starts to rise
only after an initial lag period. It is also interesting to note that
at high fluoride concentrations there is a clear dip in the signal
intensity for the first few seconds, followed by an increase, most
likely indicating faster dioxetane opening compared with other processes
involved. Small oscillations in the signal intensity as shown in the
figure above (Figure 4) are also to be expected, as autoinductive (self-amplified) processes
with essential steps of different rates result in nonlinear behavior.

Figure 4 Normalized
chemiluminescence emission data for compound 10 as a
function of time in the presence of increasing F– concentrations. The probe concentration is 200 μM in DMSO.
Chemiluminescence data were recorded 10 s after the addition of TBAF.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we were
able to demonstrate that ion signals can
be amplified and coupled to a chemiluminescence output. Also, it appears
that the rational design of oscillating reactions based on similar
systems would be possible by studying the rates of the different processes
involved.

Our work in that direction is in progress.

Experimental
Section
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H
NMR) and carbon
nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were recorded
on a Bruker Spectrospin Avance DPX 400 spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent. Chemical shift values were reported in ppm
from tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Spin multiplicities were
reported as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), and m (multiplet).
High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were acquired on an
Agilent Technologies 6530 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS. Chemiluminescence
measurements were taken on a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorometer. For
other experimental details, please refer to an earlier publication.10
