This paper presents an efficient pathway to achieve the
dielectric
constant as low as 2.48 @ 25 °C, 1 MHz for nonporous poly(imide
siloxane) films with mechanical and thermal robustness. A symmetric
disiloxane-linked alkyl diamine, bis(aminopropyl)tetramethyldisiloxane
(BATMS) with a well-defined molecular formula NH2CH2CH2CH2Si(CH3)2OSi(CH3)2CH2CH2CH2NH2, has been used to controllably reduce the dielectric
constant of the polymer films by adjusting the loading of BATMS. The
thermal stability of all the polymer films remains robust with T5 and T10 no less
than 458 and 472 °C, respectively, while the glass-transition
temperature decreases with increasing incorporation of flexible disiloxane-alkyl
segments into a polymer backbone. There exists a consistent regularity
between the thermal, optical, and dielectric properties with the loading
amount of BATMS in the polymer films, inferring that the disiloxane-alkyl
segments are homogeneously distributed in the polymer backbone. Charge-transfer
complex inhibition of polymer films by disiloxane segments has been
revealed by an enlarged d-spacing in wide-angle X-ray
diffraction spectra and a blue shift in film fluorescence emission
spectra. The combined low dielectric constant, robust mechanical and
thermal stability, and improved hydrophobicity make the series of
BATMS-resulting poly(imide siloxane) films promising candidates for
sophisticated flexible microelectronic application.

1 Introduction
Polyimides (PIs) are regarded
as high-performance polymers because
of their excellent chemical, thermal, and irradiation stability; high
mechanical strength; and reliable electrical insulation and therefore
widely used in aerospace, microelectronics, optoelectronics, and civil
engineering in different forms including films, composite resins,
fibers, and plastics.1,2 However, every coin has two sides.
While possessing these remarkable performances, PIs suffer from inherent
drawbacks such as poor processability, intense coloration, and particularly
high dielectric constant for nowadays state-of-the-art microelectronic
application because of strong polarized chain packing that results
from the charge-transfer complexes (CTCs) formed between the alternate
electron-accepting and electron-donating aromatic rings of the neighboring
chains.3,4 On the other hand, polysiloxane represents
another category of high-performance polymers widely used as electronic
packaging, which is skeletally composed of an alternate Si–O
bond that is the most prevalent bond in our terrestrial environment
with high bond energy (BDE = 445 kJ/mol).5 Despite the strong Si–O bond, the backbone of linear polysiloxane
is noodle-like “soft” with negligible interchain interaction
because of the surrounding apolar alkyl groups, predominantly methyl,
along the polymer backbone, which offers polysiloxane with great chain
rotation ease and superior hydrophobicity simultaneously.6 The typical structural characteristics of rigid
PI’s and flexible polysiloxane’s backbone are integrally
depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Structural characteristic illustration of rigid PI with interchain
CTCs (left) and flexible polysiloxane with nearly zero interchain
interaction (right).

It is intriguing to explore the results if the
polysiloxane with
nearly zero interchain interaction combines with PI having polarized
interchain CT interaction. Actually, the incorporation of polysiloxane
with PI has long attracted the research interests in a wide range
of applications including adhesives,7 metal
anticorrosion coating,8 epoxy-mediated
ternary copolymers,9 fuel cell proton exchange
membranes,10 gas permeation membranes,11 and atomic oxygen erosion-resistant materials.12 The effective practice of modifying PI by polysiloxane
is to create covalent connection with imide linkage, which could generally
be classified into three approaches according to the structure of
the obtained polymers: thermoplastic copolymers by using a siloxane-containing
dianhydride,13−15 thermoplastic copolymers by using a siloxane-containing
diamine,16−23 and cross-linked copolymers by using a trifunctional aminosilane,24−26 most probably aminopropyl triethoxysilane.25 The siloxane-containing PI monomers have usually been synthesized
via the core reaction of hydrosilylation that creates C–Si
connection. The siloxane-containing dianhydride has hardly been used
in preparing PI films, and the synthetic routes of siloxane-containing
dianhydride involve complicated multistep procedures, thus difficult
to achieve high purity. In comparison, the siloxane-containing diamine
is readily accessible with high yield and purity. However, the traditional
siloxane-containing diamine is the methyl siloxane oligomer with two
terminal propylaminos. Hence, it is uncertain whether the telechelic
amino groups remain synchronously reactive toward condensation with
the dianhydride because the “immiscibility” probably
occurs with an elongated siloxane oligomer chain, which would become
impedimental to the condensation of the telechelic amino toward the
dianhydride. These disadvantages would aggravate for preparing PI
films where the polymerization degree is very important to achieve
PI films with high quality.

Herein, we present an unoligomerized,
symmetric siloxane diamine
monomer bis(aminopropyl)tetramethyldisiloxane (BATMS) synthesized
following a process developed in our laboratory, in which two aminopropyls
are connected by minimized disiloxane linker (see Scheme S1 and Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information). Poly(siloxane
imide) films were therefrom prepared by copolymerizing BATMS with
a commercial diamine 4,4′-oxydianiline (ODA) in different compositions
toward a commercial dianhydride 4,4′-oxydiphthalic dianhydride
(ODPA) through a two-step process. In this work, the diamine monomer
(BATMS) has a well-defined molecular formula NH2CH2CH2CH2Si(CH3)2OSi(CH3)2CH2CH2CH2NH2, unlike the traditional oligomerized siloxane
diamine in which multiple siloxane segments are not precisely controlled
but with just an average chain length depending on different oligomerization
formulations. The strategy of the minimized disiloxane linkage in
BATMS aims at facilitating the synchronous condensation reactivity
of the two terminal amino groups toward the dianhydride, which otherwise
might not be guaranteed for telechelic amino in the oligomerized siloxane
diamine. According to the BATMS molar percentage (χ) in diamine
comonomers, the copolymer films were coded as PI-χ in which
χ is one of 10, 25, 40, 50, 60, 75, and 90. The use of the disiloxane-linked
alkyl diamine BATMS in the synthesis of copolymer films is illustrated
in Scheme 1.

Films PI-χ
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Polymer Synthesis
All the polymerizations
were carried out by condensing the dianhydride ODPA with an equimolar
diamine mixture of ODA and BATMS in one portion, following a two-step
thermal imidization process to generate copolymer films peeled from
a glass plate. Nylon salt formation in some cases occurred during
the first step of poly(amic acid) (PAA) process because of the basicity
of BATMS, but the nylon salts could generally be reversed (redissolved)
by moderately increasing the temperature, and robust PI films were
obtained after the following thermal treatment. The exception is PI-90,
in which case, because of the high molar percentage of BATMS, the
reversion of nylon salt demonstrated great difficulties with partial
redissolution achieved, which eventually led to the reduced mechanical
properties of the copolymer films.

2.2 Mechanical and Thermal Properties
Except for PI-90, which was fragile and unable to generate the mechanical
test results, the copolymer films exhibit tensile strength ranging
from 124.4 to 61.8 MPa, tensile modulus ranging from 2.77 to 1.74
GPa, and elongation at break ranging 28.4 to 17.0%. The mechanical
properties of the copolymer films show gradual decrease with increasing
χ, which could be attributed to the increasing degree of nylon
salt formation that decreases the degree of polymerization of copolymer
films, even if the redissolution of precipitated nylon salts was achievable.
Another probable reason is that the increasing disiloxane and alkyl
segment decreases the structural regularity and rigidity of the polymer
main chain, thus reducing the chain orientation and eventually the
mechanical properties of the copolymer films.

The glass-transition
temperature (Tg) was measured by dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA), as shown by loss tan δ curves in Figure 2a, where the transitions
are explicitly seen with sharp peaks. The copolymer films present
a consecutive decrease from 230 °C to 108 °C with an increasing
χ from 10 to 75. Understandably, the increasing introduction
of flexible disiloxane and alkyl segments reduces the rigidity and
imparts greater rotation ease with the copolymer backbone, which together
contribute to the decreasing Tg. The thermal
decomposition curves of the films in N2 are displayed in Figure 2b, where the 5% weight
loss temperature (T5) and 10% weight loss
temperature (T10) values present a similar
regular decrease with increasing BATMS, which could be attributable
to the increasing presence of thermally labile aliphatic propyl linkage
between amino functionality and disiloxane segment in BATMS. Despite
the decreasing trend with increasing BATMS percentage, T5 and T10 values of all the
seven films are higher than 458 and 472 °C, showing robust thermal
stability that is favorable to withstand a high-temperature fabrication
process.

The introduction of disiloxane segments exerts manifold
effects
in modifying the PI’s polymer backbone structure. First, the
insertion of disiloxane segments breaks the aromatic conjugated structure;
meanwhile, the thermal stability of the polymer is not much compromised
because the Si–O bond inherently offers robust high-temperature
resistance. The reasons of the slight decrease in thermal stability
are the pendent methyl substituents and the propyls that link the
disiloxane segments with imide rings along the polymer backbone.

Second, disiloxane is flexible with low rotation energy because
of the large bond length of Si–O (161 pm) and Si–C (188
pm) and more importantly the presence of the silicon-attached apolar
methyl substituents. Therefore, the incorporation of disiloxane segments
makes the rigid imide-containing polymer mainchain rotatable, and
the flexibility increases with increasing content of disiloxane; hence,
the Tg of the polymer regularly exhibits
a gradual decrease with increasing disiloxane percentage. The perfect
regularity between the variation of thermal properties and the molar
percentage of BATMS in diamine comonomers infers that BATMS was effectively
copolymerized with ODA toward ODPA and that the disiloxane segments
were homogeneously inserted into the polymer chain as anticipated.

2.3 Inhibited Polymer CTC
PI’s
typical interchain CTC would be weakened by the inserted disiloxane
segments because of the intrinsic negligible interchain interaction
of polysiloxane. Meanwhile, disiloxane incorporation leads to the
increased polymer chain flexibility that further inhibits the CTC
by the enlarged interchain distance (d-spacing),
as derived from wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) spectra in Figure 3a. According to the
Bragg equation, the smaller the diffraction angle is, the larger the
average interchain spacing is. It can be seen that the diffraction
2θ decreases with increasing disiloxane percentage, indicating
that the presence of disiloxane enlarges the copolymer interchain
distance. The enlarged interchain distance leads to improvement in
the solubility of copolymer films, as shown in Table 2.

c ND: not determined.

The film fluorescence is another supporting evidence
for CTC inhibition.
The PI film fluorescence is associated with its aggregate state. In
the presence of strong CTC in PI, the polymer chains would pack together
and form an ordered aggregate structure, which tend to emit CT fluorescence
with longer wavelength if excited.27 However,
the PI film emits fluorescence at a shorter wavelength when the CTC
was weakened. In general, a typical CT fluorescence wavelength is
usually longer than 450 nm, and fully aromatic PI emits fluorescence
at a longer wavelength than alicyclic PI.28 Although the difference between peak wavelength is slight, the gradual
“blue shift” of CT fluorescence is observed from PI-10
(497 nm) to PI-90 (473 nm), as shown in Figure 3b.

The increasing insertion of flexible
disiloxane segments increases
the rotation capability of the polymer backbone; therefore, the interchain
π–π stacking associated with the rigid and highly
coplanarized polymer structure is weakened. As a consequence, consecutive
“blue shifts” in the emission fluorescence of the copolymer
films on increasing the percentage of BATMS are generated. As shown
in Table 3, besides
the blue shift in fluorescence emission, the reduced CTC is also manifested
by enhancement of optical transparency (increasing λ0) of copolymer films with increasing χ.

2.4 Dielectric Properties, Moisture Absorption,
and Polymer Chain Volume
PI films have been integrated into
microelectronic devices such as flexible printed circuits for several
decades.29 At the forefront of this research
field has been how to reduce the dielectric constant (ε′)
of PI films with an aim to achieve the high-speed and high-fidelity
signal transmission. As microelectronic miniaturization continues
to develop according to the dictation by “Moore’s law”,
the degraded performances of electronic components have become increasingly
translated into resistance–capacitance time delay (RC delay) during signal transmission, which would be alleviated
only by lowering the ε′ of the insulating materials.30,31 The proposed roadmap to reduce the ε′ of the insulating
materials so far seems a little aggressive in practical microelectronic
fabrication, but the trend remains undoubted, and considerable research
interests have thus been inspired in devising new PI films to reduce
the ε′. For instance, sacrificial thermolabile components
have been introduced into PI films with an aim to introduce air (εair′ = 1)
by making porous voids.32,33 Nevertheless, these
approaches remain industrially impractical because of the complicated
fabrication process and the compromised flexural strength of the composite
PI films as well. The appealing approach toward low dielectric constant
PI films for practical microelectronic application is polymer backbone
structure optimization, like introducing bulky group, fluorinated
and aliphatic structure via the functionalized monomers.34−36 Recently, Fang and co-workers have prepared the fluorinated polysiloxane
with thermally induced cross-linking network structure, which exhibited
a low dielectric constant at high frequency.37,38 Ando reported the use of the trifunctional organosilicon to prepare
low dielectric cross-linked PIs with silica and ever investigated
the effects of BATMS-ODPA segment in the cross-linked PIs.39,40

Our present work focuses on the thermoplastic poly(imide siloxane)
films, in which each disiloxane-alkyl is alternated by the imide ring
in the BATMS-ODPA chain segments. Even though the chain segments of
BATMS-ODPA and ODA-ODPA might be randomly distributed along the copolymer
mainchain, the BATMS-ODPA segments are certainly composed of structural
alternation of disiloxane-alkyl and imide ring. Besides, the disiloxane
is structurally well defined in BATMS, instead of a roughly mean chain
length in the traditional oligomerized siloxane diamine. The minimized
disiloxane structure in BATMS eliminated the microphase separation
that may occur with an oligomerized siloxane diamine during the polycondensation
with a dianhydride. This further explains the consistent regularity
between the content of BATMS-ODPA segment in polymer mainchain and
the properties of the copolymer films.

The well-defined disiloxane-alkyl
segments that alternate with
an imide ring structure, and the absence of phase separation as well,
provide a desired polymer backbone structure for investigating the
dielectric properties of this series of poly(imide siloxane) films.
The general dielectric properties @ 25 °C, 1 MHz and moisture
absorption of the three poly(imide siloxane) films are summarized
in Table 3, which shows
that increasing χ leads to smaller ε′ and stable
dielectric loss ε″.41 Although
the copolymer films have the ε″ values slightly larger
than 0.01, they are favorable for microelectronic application, considering
their substantially lowered ε′. The reducing water absorption
(WA @ 60 °C for 48 h) with increasing disiloxane percentage in
the polymer backbone was observed because of the inherent hydrophobicity
of disiloxane segments, which is an important compensating advantage
to pristine PI that is insufficiently water-repelling because of the
hydrophilicity of the polar imide ring.

Here, we chose three
copolymer film samples PI-40, PI-60, and PI-75
for detailed exploration of the effects of the disiloxane-alkyl segment
on the ε′ by dynamic dielectric measurements. As illustrated
in Figure 4a, the ε′
plots as a function of temperature (ε′–T) for three samples at frequencies of 1 MHz and 1 Hz were
recorded in the range between −150 and 200 °C. The content
of incorporated siloxane-alkyl segments is found to exert a remarkable
effect on reducing the dielectric constant of the copolymer films.
With χ increasing from 40 to 60 and 75, the copolymer film presents
a consecutive and obvious decrease in ε′. The remarkable
reduction in ε′ would be ascribed to the comprehensive
effects of the intrinsic nonpolarizability of disiloxane segments
and the altered aggregate state of the copolymer films. The homogeneously
inserted disiloxane-alkyl segments reduce the CT chain packing and
break the interchain coplanarization by enlarging the chain spacing
and increasing the backbone flexibility. With increasing temperature,
the ε′ gradually increases because of the increasing
mobility of the polymer backbone, and when the temperature is approaching Tg, the ε′ increases remarkably.
Because higher disiloxane-alkyl content leads to lower Tg of the copolymer films, there appears an overlap zone
in the temperature range in the proximity of Tg in the dielectric spectra for the three samples. ε′
variation with frequency (ε′–F) curves at 25 °C is displayed in the inset of Figure 4a, which shows that the ε′
value of all the samples decreases with increasing frequency correspondingly.
The frequency dependency of ε′ can be accounted for by
the dipole orientation movement of the copolymer that would gradually
become outpaced and then stagnant when the electric field alternation
keeps escalating toward higher frequency. The frequency effect is
also seen in the ε′–T curves
at 1 Hz and 1 MHz. It is found that at starting measurement temperature
(−150 °C), the ε′ at 1 Hz and 1 MHz remains
basically the same value, and when the temperature increases, the
difference between the ε′ at 1 Hz and 1 MHz becomes more
appreciable, with the former larger than the latter. The relaxation
at low temperature is more clearly seen in the ε′–T curves at 1 Hz than at 1 MHz, and these relaxations present
receding tendency with increasing χ.

films of the first heating (a) ε′ of PI-40, PI-60, and

The dielectric relaxations also reflect the intrinsic
structure
of the polymers.42 The 3-dimensional (3-D)
spectra of ε′ variation with temperature and frequency
for PI-40, PI-60, and PI-75 are displayed in Figure 4b–d, respectively, and the relaxations
have been assigned in the diagrams. The γ relaxation of PI films
occurring at low temperature is generally believed to correlate with
the phenyl and imide ring motions strongly influenced by water absorption
content, and such relaxation was reported to recede when the samples
had been completely dried before measurement in dry nitrogen. By comparing
the slope of γ relaxation of PI-40 with those of PI-60 and PI-75
for the first heating, with increasing χ, the increasing presence
of hydrophobic disiloxane segments in the polymer backbone is explicitly
observed to lead to the depression of γ relaxation at about
−100 °C. The γ relaxation for PI-60 is weaker than
that of PI-40, and particularly for PI-75, the γ relaxation
totally disappeared because of its lowest water absorption with highest
disiloxane content among the three samples. Our observations in this
work support the suggestion that the γ relaxations existing
in the PI’s dielectric spectra are associated with the water
absorption and could be inhibited by reducing the presence of water
in PI films.43 Furthermore, it confirms
that the disiloxane is homogeneously distributed in the copolymer
backbone without the presence of siloxane phase separation. Otherwise,
the separated siloxane phase relaxation usually at about −100
°C, which is located in the range of γ relaxation, would
become more clear, other than receding with increasing content of
disiloxane content in the copolymer from PI-40 to PI-75.

At
a higher temperature range than γ relaxation, there are
two secondary relaxations correlated with local movement, weak β1 and β2 relaxation. This transition is generally
associated with local bond rotations along the polymer backbone. These
motions are considered to be primarily a function of the PI structure.
Some studies reported that β relaxations are related with rotation
of phenylene and imide groups around the linkages as −O–
and −CH2–. The magnitude of the activation
energy of a secondary relaxation depends on rotational potential energy
barriers, internal frictions, and the volume and environment of the
moving repeat units. The stronger the energy barrier and internal
friction are, the more appreciable the β relaxations are. With
an increase in χ, the interchain CT interaction is reduced because
of the increase of nonpolar and flexible disiloxane-alkyl segments
in the polymer backbone, which leads to increased rotation ease, decreased
internal friction, and enlarged free volume of the repeat units along
the polymer chain. As a result, β1 and β2 relaxations present receding tendency with increasing disiloxane
content in PI films. Similar to the case of γ relaxation, the
β1 and β2 relaxations of PI-60 are
weaker than those of PI-40. PI-75 shows an absence of such β1 and β2 relaxations.

α-Transition
at higher temperature than β1 and β2 relaxation is the main transition that arises
from polymer mainchain movement. The mainchain motion determines the
dielectric behavior of α-transition. With more disiloxane-alkyl
incorporation, the copolymer mainchain is more flexible and the dipole
orientations along the mainchain are more responsive in the alternating
electric field. Therefore, it is observed in the dielectric spectra
that PI-75 has the most responsive α-transition, manifested
by the highest maximum ε′ at the same measurement temperature
upper limit of 200 °C for all the three samples. For the same
reason, the maximum ε′ of PI-60 is larger than that of
PI-40.

The above detailed analyses of the dielectric relaxations
reveal
that with the incorporation of more disiloxane segments, the poly(imide
siloxane) backbone presents greater depression in relaxation at low
temperature, including γ relaxation at about −100 °C
and β1 and β2 relaxations at about
ambient temperature. Combining these results with the unanimous sharp
peaks in DMA tan δ−T curves (Figure 2a) for all the measured
poly(imide siloxane) films, it can be assumed that the siloxane phase
separation at about −100 °C (typically characterized by
relaxation spectra44) commonly observed
with oligosiloxane segments could be fully eliminated by adopting
the minimized disiloxane segment in this work.

Free-volume analysis
has been employed in studying the effect of
a bulky group such as triptycene in enabling microporous PIs for gas
separation and low dielectric application.45,46 It was reported that the hierarchical triptycene structure enlarges
the free volume of the polymer chain by the contribution of its steric
bulkiness. Fractional free volume (FFV) is an established parameter
to evaluate whether a specific group or substructure contributes to
enlarge the free volume of the polymer. Here, we calculated the van
der Waals volume and FFV of film samples with different χ based
on group contribution Bondi method,47−49 as presented in Table 3 (see the Supporting Information for details). Compared
with wholly aromatic ODPA-ODA moiety, ODPA-BATMS is more flexible
because of the lubricating effect of noodle-like disiloxane segments.
Therefore, it can be seen that increasing χ leads to larger
van der Waals volume (Vw) of the resulting
PI. As Vw increases, the polarizable group
per volume decreases correspondingly, consistent with decreasing ε′.
Furthermore, the FFV presents an increase with an increase in χ,
indicating that disiloxane segment insertion is efficient in reducing
interchain interaction, consistent with improved solubility and higher
transparency.

3 Conclusions
In summary, an unoligomerized,
symmetric disiloxane-containing
diamine with well-defined structure, BATMS, was synthesized to copolymerize
with ODA toward ODPA to prepare poly(imide siloxane) films. As shown
in Figure 5, the properties
of copolymer films show a perfectly regular variation with the content
of BATMS, inferring the homogeneous insertion of disiloxane segments
into the copolymer backbone. The incorporated flexible and high-temperature-resistant
disiloxane segments decrease the Tg of
copolymer films but offer robust thermostability with high values
of T5 and T10 even when the molar percentage of BATMS is as high as 90. Besides,
the CTC inhibition has been confirmed by an enlarged d-spacing in WAXD and a “blue shift” in CT emission
fluorescence spectra with increasing BATMS loading. A remarkable decrease
in dielectric constant has been achieved by increasing disiloxane
incorporation, and when the molar percentage of BATMS reaches 75%,
the copolymer film PI-75 exhibits ε′ as low as 2.48 at
25 °C under 1 MHz. Our present work indicates that the minimized
disiloxane segments can be homogeneously inserted into PI’s
mainchain and controllably bring down the dielectric constant while
maintaining the good thermostability and improving the moisture resistance
of the copolymer films. In this regard, incorporation of disiloxane
segments via BATMS is a highly promising approach to achieve low dielectric
PI films for microelectronic application.

molar percentage (χ) to the properties
of polymer films (for the cases of χ = 0, commercial pristine
PI films (PMDA-ODA) were used for reference).

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Commercially available N,N′-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) was
purified by vacuum distillation over P2O5 and
stored over 4 Å molecular series prior to use, and tetrahydrofuran
was freshly distilled in nitrogen over sodium. ODA and 4,4′-oxydiphthalic
dianhydride (ODPA) were purified by sublimation before use. Other
reagents and solvents were obtained commercially and used as received.

4.2 Preparation of Polymer Films
The
diamine mixture of ODA and BATMS with a certain molar percentage was
dissolved in dry DMAc under stirring, and then equimolar dianhydride
ODPA in dry DMAc was dropped into the mixture with gradually increasing
stirring intensity. The solid content of the polycondensation solution
was 12–15 wt %. For the cases of high molar percentage of BATMS
such as 60, 75, and 90, the nylon salt precipitation was observed;
on increasing the reaction temperature to 40–70 °C depending
on the molar percentage of BATMS, the nylon salt could be dissolved
and reverted toward the polycondensation. The fully soluble PAAs were
rapidly cast onto the preheated glass plate and then subjected to
thermal imidization following the process of 4 h @ 100 °C, 2
h @ 150 °C, 2 h @ 200 °C, and 2 h @ 250 °C. The poly(imide
siloxane) films were stripped from the glass plates after being soaked
in boiled water and dried for measurements. The poly(imide siloxane)
copolymer films were denoted as PI-χ where χ is the molar
percentage of BATMS in the diamine mixture.

4.3 Characterization
1H NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer with DMSO-d6 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the
internal reference. An Instron universal tester model 1122 (GB/T1040.1-2006)
was used to study the stress–strain behavior of the PI film
samples, and the measurements were performed at room temperature with
a stretching rate of 2.5 mm/min, and the data were the average value
of five experiments except for the maximum and minimum value. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted with a PerkinElmer TGA-2
in flowing nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. DMA measurement
was conducted with DMA Q800V20.22 Build 41 using tensile mode at a
frequency of 1 Hz and heating rate of 3 °C/min. WAXD measurement
was performed at 25 °C on a Bede XRD Di system, using graphite-monochromatized
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The solubility of the
copolymer films was investigated in different organic solvents, in
which the copolymer films were cut into pieces as small as possible
and then put into the solvent with 2 mg/mL content. The fluorescence
spectra of copolymer films were recorded with a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence
spectrometer. The emission spectra were recorded with excitation at
peak wavelengths of the corresponding excitation spectra. Ultraviolet
visible (UV–vis) spectra of the polymer films were recorded
on a Shimadzu UV–visible spectrophotometer UV-2450. Dielectric
spectroscopy measurements of the polymer film with the temperature
variation in the range of 150–520 K and the frequency variation
in the range of 1 to 107 Hz have been performed using a
Novocontrol Dielectric Spectrometer (GmbH Germany), CONCEPT 40. Polymer
film electrodes with a diameter of 20 mm and thickness of 40–80
μm having gold plated were placed in a flat parallel plate capacitor,
and the amplitude of ac applied voltage was 1 V. Coefficients of thermal
expansion (CTEs) of the copolymer films were detected in an optical
dilatometer DIL-806 dilatometer (Baehr-Thermoanalyse GmbH, Germany)
with a heating rate of 10 K/min and measurement precision of 0.1 μm.
