Injectable thermosensitive
hydrogels have been widely investigated
for drug delivery systems. Chitosan (CH) is one of the most abundant
natural polymers, and its biocompatibility and biodegradability make
it a favorable polymer for thermosensitive hydrogel formation. The
addition of nanoparticles can improve its drug release behavior, remote
actuation capability, and biological interactions. Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) have been studied for the use in drug delivery systems, and
they can act as drug delivery vehicles to improve the delivery of
different types of therapeutic agents. In this work, carbon nanotubes
were incorporated into a thermosensitive and injectable hydrogel formed
by chitosan and β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) (CH−β-GP–CNTs).
The hybrid hydrogels loaded with methotrexate (MTX) were liquid at
room temperature and became a solidified gel at body temperature.
A number of tests including scanning electron microscopy, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction
were utilized to characterize the MTX-loaded CH−β-GP–CNT
hybrid hydrogels. The cell viability (alamarBlue) assay showed that
hydrogels containing CNT (0.1%) were not toxic to the 3T3 cells. In
vitro MTX release study revealed that CNT-containing hydrogels (with
0.1% CNT) demonstrated a decreased MTX releasing rate compared with
control hydrogels without CNT. The cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells
were used to evaluate the efficacy of CH−β-GP–CNT
hybrid hydrogels delivering MTX on the control of tumor cell growth.
Results demonstrated that CNT (0.1%) in the hydrogel enhanced the
MTX antitumor function. Our study indicates that a thermosensitive
CH−β-GP–CNT hybrid hydrogel can be used as a potential
breast cancer therapy system for controlled delivery of MTX.

1 Introduction
Breast cancer can be treated
if diagnosed in the early stages.
Among the different methods of cancer treatment, chemotherapy is the
most commonly used and up-to-date approach. Moreover, chemotherapy
is an essential step before and after surgery to treat the tumor and
prevent reoccurrence and metastasis.1,2 However, the
toxicity generated by chemotherapeutic agents is a major concern of
chemotherapy. The effect of therapeutic agents administrated intravenously
is nonspecific in nature since they generate function on both diseased
and healthy cells, consequently causing undesired side effects. To
generate a more efficient therapeutic effect, efforts have made in
the past decade to develop a targeted drug delivery system.3

Among the different materials used for
drug delivery applications,
polymeric hydrogels have attracted major attention.4,5 Hydrogels
are defined as cross-linked polymeric networks that have the ability
to absorb an enormous amount of water or biological fluid, despite
the fact that they are actually insoluble in water.6 Hydrogels can be made of natural polymers such as chitosan
(CH), gelatin, collagen, and dextran. Biocompatibility and biodegradability
of natural polymers make them suitable for biomedical applications,
especially as drug delivery devices.7 In
situ forming hydrogels have the ability to respond to environmental
stimuli such as temperature, pressure, light, pH, ions, and molecules
as well as electric, magnetic, and sound fields.8

As one type of biopolymers, chitosan has been investigated
as implantable
biomaterials.7,9,10 Studies
have shown that the chitosan-based scaffolds are highly biocompatible.11−13 The β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) can function as a neutralizing
agent to facilitate the chitosan to form a thermosensitive hydrogel.
Because the mixture of chitosan and β-GP can form a hydrogel
at body temperature (37 °C), they can potentially be used as
injectable biomaterials for drug delivery.14−16

The main
drawback of the CH−β-GP hydrogels is their
lack of mechanical strength, which can be improved by incorporating
nanoparticles, thus improving their drug release behavior and biological
interactions.17 Hydrogel hybrids with nanoparticle
inclusions, such as clay, gold, silver, iron oxide, and carbon nanotubes
(CNTs), have been synthesized and studied for possible biomedical
applications.18

Several research
studies have focused on CNT usage in biological
systems. CNTs have been shown to be a potential scaffold material
in nanobiotechnology applications. Moreover, they have been studied
for drug delivery systems, and it has been found that the delivery
of different types of therapeutic agents improves by using CNTs as
the drug delivery vehicle. The main reason for the effectiveness of
CNTs in drug delivery applications is their high surface area, which
allows for a high loading capacity of therapeutic drugs.19−22 The biocompatibility of CNTs depends on a number of factors including
their fabrication process, the presence of impurities (normally metallic
catalysts), their size and shape, their dispersion and aggregation
station as well as the method of administration and cellular uptake.23,24

Several polysaccharides with CNT incorporation have been studied
to investigate the effect of this addition on hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
and surface chemistry on cell behavior.25 In one study, CH hydrogel beads were prepared using different amounts
of CNTs, and their mechanical strength, acid stability, and adsorption
capacity to an anionic dye were examined.26 Gelatin, which has also been used to synthesize CNT hybrid hydrogels,
is another prospective material in biomedical applications. The swelling
(SW) property of physically mixed gelatin/CNT hydrogels was examined
in one of the earliest studies in this field.27 In another study, gellan gum (water soluble anionic polysaccharide)
was incorporated with CNTs to make an electrically conductive hydrogel
for the purpose of electrical cell stimulation. Results showed that
1.3 wt % of CNT was required to achieve an electrically conductive
hydrogel for the stated purpose.28 Carbon
nanotubes and carbon nanofibers were used to reinforce poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels for an osteochondral repair, and this combination
showed better biological responses than pure PVA hydrogels.29 In another study, CNT–PVA hybrid hydrogels
were prepared and investigated for their swelling and mechanical properties.20 The addition of multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWNTs) was studied in freeze-dried chitosan scaffolds in a 2012 study
by Venkatesan et al.,30 who suggested that
CH–MWNTs scaffolds have a potential use in bone tissue engineering.
In one of the latest studies, in 2014, Aryaei et al.31 investigated the mechanical and biological properties of
CH–CNT nanocomposite films. They concluded that the tensile
strength and elastic modulus were improved by adding 1 wt % of MWNTs
to the chitosan matrix. Also, in their study, no cell toxicity was
observed after 3 and 7 days of cell proliferation tests on CH–MWNT
nanocomposites.

In this study, we fabricated a CH−β-GP–CNTs
hydrogel by incorporating CNTs into the CH−β-GP. We characterized
the hydrogels using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy.
The releasing profile of methotrexate (MTX) from CH−β-GP–CNTs
hydrogels was analyzed. The MTX-loaded chitosan hydrogels have been
tested for its function on the control of MCF-7 breast cancer cell
growth. We demonstrated that the nanohybrid hydrogels significantly
improved antitumor function of MTX in vitro test.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Analysis
The hydrogels
were formed after incubation of the solution in an incubator of 37
°C. Figure 1 shows
the chitosan/β-GP at room temperature (left) and 37 °C
(right). Figure 2A–F
shows SEM images of CH−β-GP–CNT hydrogels. All
hydrogels indicated an irregular porous structure. It can be seen
that the blank CH−β-GP hydrogel shows a porous structure
(Figure 2A) with a
fairly smooth matrix surface (Figure 2B); whereas by the addition of CNT (0.1 and 0.5%),
the hydrogels’ appearance look falking (Figure 2C,E), and the surface roughness seems to
increase (Figure 2D,F).
The surface roughness can be attributed to the agglomerations of CNTs
within the polymeric matrix. However, CH−β-GP–CNT
nanohybrid hydrogels still presented as a structure with small porosity.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the fabricated CH−β-GP–CNT
hydrogels are suitable for various biomedical applications, such as
tissue implants as well as drug delivery systems porosity.32−34

Contact angle measurements were made using water as the liquid
phase, since the density of water (1 g/cm3) is similar
to the density of the extracellular fluid within the body, which is
mainly blood (1.06 g/cm3). The work of adhesion, which
is the energy required for two surfaces to adhere to each other, is
a rough estimation of the surface energy. The results for contact
angle and work of adhesion for different hydrogel samples are shown
in Table 1.

Table 1 Contact Angles and Work of Adhesion
of Hybrid Hydrogels
sample	contact angle
(°)	work of adhesion (mJ/m2)	
chitosan	82 ± 1	8.14	
CH–CNT 0.1%	85 ± 2	7.80	
CH–CNT 0.5%	89 ± 2	7.23	
From Table 1, it
can be seen that the addition of nanoparticles increases the contact
angle and hydrophobicity. It has been reported that hydrophobic materials
are desirable options for drug delivery applications, since hydrophobicity
decreases the degradation kinetics and lowers the drug release behavior
as well.35 Moreover, cell adhesion and
biocompatibility were found to be maximized on surfaces with water
contact angles of 60–90°.36 The work of adhesion decreases with increasing nanotube concentration.
Surface adhesion and contact angle are dependent on a variety of factors,
such as the presence of chemical bonding, impurities, surface roughness,
oxide layer, etc. Therefore, an accurate conclusion is complicated
because of the interaction of different factors. However, the test
results are consistent with the literature. All three carbon-based
nanomaterials used in this work were shown to increase surface hydrophobicity.37−39

FTIR spectra results are shown in Figure 3A,B. The spectra of CH–CNT (0, 0.1,
and 0.5% of CNT) hydrogels are also provided in Figure 3A. The characteristic peaks of chitosan (as
in Figure 3B) can be
observed in all of the hydrogels’ spectra. The C–O stretching
at 1050 and 970 cm–1 indicates the characteristic
saccharide structure of chitosan. The C–CH3 symmetric
deformation appeared at around 1420 cm–1. A wide
peak variation in the range of 3750–3000 cm–1 is due to stretching vibrations of the OH groups, which are overlapped
with the stretching vibrations of N–H. The two small peaks
at 2870 and 2890 cm–1 are attributed to C–H
bonding in the −CH2 and C–H3 groups,
respectively. Peaks in the range of 1680–1480 cm–1 are assigned to amide and amine groups, where carbonyl bond (C=O)
vibrations of the secondary amide group are at 1645 cm–1, and protonated amine group NH3 vibrations are at 1584
cm–1. β-GP characteristic peaks (Figure 3B) were also recognizable
in the CH−β-GP hybrid hydrogel spectra. The peak at 3233
cm–1 is due to hydrogen-bonded O–H stretching.
Typical bands of the inorganic phase for the PO43 groups are shown
as the mode at 900–1200 cm–1. With the addition
of CNTs, a slight variation in stretching frequency was observed,
which can be attributed to pi-bonds of the carbon nanotube chemically
interacting with the amide and OH groups of the chitosan. However,
most peaks belong to CH moieties, therefore we can conclude that there
was no chemical bonding formation between chitosan and CNT.30,31,40

(0, 0.1, and 0.5%) hybrid hydrogels. (B) FTIR spectra of CH powder,

CH powder, CH hydrogel, and CH–CNT hybrid hydrogel.

Raman spectrum tests were performed for pure CNT
and the hybrid
hydrogel containing 0.5% of CNT (Figure 3C). Raman spectrum test can characterize
the molecular morphology of carbon nanomaterials. The tests of Raman
spectra and FTIR provide a better understanding of how nanotubes change
the chemical structure of hydrogels. In both CNT and CH–CNT
spectra, the characteristic D-band and G-band peaks are visible at
1330 and 1580 cm–1, respectively. The Raman spectrum
of a CNT is similar to graphene, which is not too surprising since
a CNT is composed of rolled-up sheets of graphene.41 Since the intensities of the CNT peaks are much higher
than the intensity of chitosan peaks, none of the chitosan peaks was
observed. Overall, Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of nanotubes
in the hybrid hydrogels and showed no changes in the chemical structure
of nanoparticles.31,42−45

Figure 3D shows
the results of XRD analysis. Currently, six polymorphs of chitosan
are known. Normally, chitosan shows three XRD peaks, corresponding
to two different crystalline structures. The hydrated (tendon) crystalline
structure shows a peak at 2θ = 10° (or two peaks at 2θ
= 8 and 12°), whereas the anhydrous crystalline structure shows
one peak at 2θ = 15°. Chitosan also shows a broad peak
around 2θ = 20°, which is due to the existence of an amorphous
structure. The XRD pattern of chitosan powder (Figure 3D) shows that the chitosan used in this study
had a hydrated (tendon) crystalline structure.

Chitosan is a
semicrystalline polymer, whereas β-glycerophosphate
is a crystalline solid. The XRD pattern of the CH hydrogel shows the
characteristic peaks of chitosan. From the XRD graph of CH–CNT,
it can be seen that the incorporation of CNTs into the CH hydrogel
did not affect the crystalline structure of chitosan, since there
was no significant change in the XRD pattern of the CH–CNT
hybrid hydrogel in comparison with the pure chitosan hydrogel. The
addition of 0.5% CNTs to the chitosan hydrogel did not seem to make
a noticeable change in the XRD pattern. However, a graphite-like peak
(002) at 25.78° is present, which is the main characteristic
peak of CNTs.43 These results are consistent
with those in the literature.30,31,46−48

2.2 Swelling and Degradation
Behavior of Hydrogels
The swelling (SW) profile of CH−β-GP–CNT
hydrogels
was tested. The hydrogel samples were incubated in phosphate buffer
solution (PBS) at 37 °C, and then the sample weight was measured
at various time points. The results showed that the addition of carbon
nanotubes in the hydrogels increased the sample swelling ratio (Figure 4). The swelling kinetics
of the hydrogels was analyzed according to the following equation.
The amount of water absorbed by a hydrogel at a specific time (t) is shown as Mt, which is
equal to Wt – W0. In the equation, k represents the
swelling characteristic constant and n is the diffusional
exponent. Both k and n depend on
the polymer–solvent system. The swelling ratio (water uptake)
was calculated as Mt/W0, which is an exponential function of time  Two types of swelling processes can be considered
according to the equation: the Fickian or diffusion-controlled swelling
process and the non-Fickian swelling process. In Fickian swelling
process (n ≤ 0.5), the solvent diffusion rate
is slower than the relaxation rate of the polymer chain. There are
two types of non-Fickian swelling processes which are relaxation-controlled,
when the diffusion rate is higher than that of relaxation (n = 1) and anomalous diffusion, when the diffusion and relaxation
rates are comparable (0.5 < n < 1). When the
logarithmic values of SW versus time are plotted, the slope of the
plot is indicated as n and the intercept value is
indicated as k. Because the n values
of the tested hydrogels were ≤0.5 (results not shown) in this
study, we conclude that the swelling behavior of chitosan hydrogels
with and without nanotubes fits the Fickian process.49−53

(B, C) Degradation assay of CH−β-GP–CNT (0, 0.1,
and 0.5%) hybrid hydrogels.

Hydrogel degradation has been known to have a vital impact
on drug
release behavior. The degradation profile of the hybrid chitosan hydrogels
is tested in this study (Figure 4B,C). We show that the addition of lysozyme amplified
the hydrogel degradation rate as reported.54 Also, the inclusion of carbon nanotubes showed a decrease in weight
loss. Although chitosan hydrogels in the presence of lysozyme degraded
about 61.9% in 3 weeks, the CNT-loaded chitosan hydrogels had degradation
values of 16.5 and 25.9% for 0.1 and 0.5% CNT inclusions, respectively.
These results confirm that the interactions between chitosan and CNTs
improve the biological properties.

2.3 Cell
Viability Assay
The toxicity
of prepared hydrogels was studied using the alamarBlue reagent.55 The fibroblast 3T3 cells were grown on top of
the hydrogels for 4 days; cell viability percentage results are shown
in Figure 5A. Addition
of carbon nanotubes did not stop cell growth, and compared to the
control, which is the CH−β-GP hydrogel without any CNT
cells, it can be seen that cells are still growing on top of the CH−β-GP–CNT
hydrogel. However, the addition of carbon nanotubes decreases cell
growth to some point comparable to the pure chitosan hydrogel, yet
the cell viability is still more than 80%, which is acceptable in
biomedical applications. These results confirm that the fabricated
hydrogel in this study is biocompatible. The fluorescent imaging assay
of cytoskeleton was carried out to confirm the cell viability. The
fixed 3T3 cells were labeled with rhodamine phalloidin (red) and Hoechst
(blue). The cell morphology in taken images (Figure 5B–D) clearly demonstrated the live
cells and confirmed the viability of 3T3 cells after culturing on
hydrogels for 4 days. The study showed that the hydrogel containing
0.1% CNT should be an optimal condition for drug delivery. The test
is also consistent with alamarBlue results that increasing of CNT
amount in hydrogels decreased the cell viability.31

0.5% CNT and 1% CNT.

2.4 In Vitro Methotrexate Release
The
cumulative methotrexate (MTX) release from CH−β-GP–CNT
hybrid hydrogels for 7 days in vitro is shown in Figure 6. The incorporation of CNTs
in the hydrogels reduced the initial burst release of MTX. The amount
of released MTX from the hydrogel without CNT was 24.7% in the first
4 h, whereas hydrogels with 0.1 and 0.5% of CNT decreased the MTX
release to 12.9 and 10.7%, respectively. By increasing the concentration
of CNTs, the burst release decreased. Then, the release rate decreased
after 24 h. The nanoparticle-loaded hydrogels and control hydrogels
basically showed a similar releasing trend after 24 h. This trend
may be caused by the following mechanism. First, the MTX that is partially
absorbed onto the surface of the hydrogels during gelation results
in the initial burst release. The MTX in the gel matrix can show a
decreased releasing rate. Second, the decrease in the MTX concentration
gradient (dC/dx) can also cause
a decreased MTX releasing over time. The addition of CNTs in the hydrogel
matrix resulted in an extensive bonding that causes a rigid network.
The diffusion of MTX from a rigid network is slower than that from
a loose network. The reduction of the amount of burst release is desired
for drug therapeutic function since it allows the therapeutic drug
to maintain an optimal level for a prolonged therapeutic period of
time.13,56

Figure 6 Release of methotrexate from CH−β-GP–CNT
hybrid
hydrogels.

To understand the in vitro releasing
kinetics (or pharmacokinetics)
of MTX from the CNT-loaded hydrogels and control hydrogels, the drug
release profile was fitted into the Korsmeyer–Peppas model  In the equation, Mt and M∞ represent the fraction
of drug release at time t, and K represents the release rate constant. The n represents
the release exponent. The model was analyzed using the solver tool
in Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). The release rate
constant (K), release exponent (n), and the correlation coefficient are calculated and reported in Table 2.

Table 2 Releasing Rate Constant (k) and Correlation Coefficient
(R2) for
CH−β-GP–CNT Hybrid Hydrogels
sample	K	n	R2	
chitosan	17.3	0.18	0.998656	
CH–CNT 0.1%	9.0	0.17	0.999709	
CH–CNT 0.5%	7.6	0.17	0.999873	
In 1983, Korsmeyer et al.57 described
the drug release from a polymeric system using a simple model, which
is now known as the Korsmeyer–Peppas model. This model fits
well for cylindrical shaped matrices, and the mechanism of drug release
is characterized by the value of the release exponent (n). The releasing mechanism is through the Fickian diffusion when n is ≤0.45. However, it indicates the non-Fickian
transport when n is between 0.45 and 0.89.49 All of these assumptions are consistent with
our drug delivery system. Therefore, the obtained n values from this study (Table 2) suggested that the MTX releasing from all of the
chitosan hybrid hydrogels had the Fickian diffusion behavior, and
the loaded CNT in the hydrogels did not change the drug release mechanism.

2.5 In Vitro Antitumor Activity
The almarBlue
assay viability assay was used to determine the antiproliferative
effect of MTX-loaded CH−β-GP–CNT hydrogels on
the cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The cell viability was reported
as the percent reduction of the almarBlue agent. The cell viability
of MCF-7 cells was tested after they were grown on MTX-loaded hydrogels
for 4 days (Figure 7). First, the study shows that the addition of CNTs (0.1%) in the
CH−β-GP hydrogel did not change the cell viability, but
the higher concentration of CNTs (0.5%) reduced cell proliferation
significantly. This result indicated the toxicity of CNT at a high
concentration (0.5%) in the hydrogel. Second, the antitumor effect
of MTX is clearly demonstrated. The MTX in both CH−β-GP–CNT
hydrogel and CH−β-GP hydrogel significantly reduced tumor
cell (MCF-7) viability compared with the corresponding hydrogels without
MTX. Third, the study demonstrated that the addition of CNT (0.1%)
in the hydrogel enhanced MTX antitumor effect.

Figure 7 Antitumor efficacy of
MTX-loaded CH−β-GP–CNT
hybrid hydrogels. *p < 0.05, compared with the
group treated with MTX. ∧p <
0.05, compared with the CH-0.5% CNT group. #p < 0.05, compared with the CH-0.5% CNT group.

In the MTX releasing study, we characterized the MTX releasing
profile and found that the CNT component in the CH−β-GP–CNT
hydrogel reduced the MTX releasing rate (Figure 5). The cumulative amount of the released
MTX from CH−β-GP–CNT hydrogel (with 0.1% CNT)
at the time point of 96 h (4 days) was 50% less than that released
from CH−β-GP hydrogel. However, the MTX-loaded CH−β-GP–CNT
hydrogel (with 0.1% CNT) and MTX-loaded CH−β-GP hydrogel
showed a similar effect on reducing cell viability of tumor cells
(MCF-7) grown on those hydrogels. The study suggests that CNT enhanced
MTX function with a low level of MTX in the cell cultured medium because
of its slow releasing rate from CH−β-GP–CNT hydrogel.
Also, sharp edges of CNTs may cause cancerous cell membrane damages
and leak out the cells, thus shrinking the tumor size. Therefore,
the incorporation of CNTs in the MTX-loaded hydrogels can significantly
inhibit cancer cell growth with less toxicity to normal cells. These
observations are consistent with the investigation of the effect of
released MTX on cell viability in a previous report.12

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we successfully fabricated thermosensitive chitosan–carbon
nanotube hybrid hydrogels. We show analyzed the surface morphology
using SEM and found that increase of the nanotube concentration in
the hydrogels increased porosity and surface roughness. Contact angle
study showed that nanotubes in the hydrogel increased the hydrophobicity
of the gels. The cell viability tests confirm that the CH–CNT
hybrid hydrogels (with 0.1% CNT) are biocompatible. An inclusion of
0.1% CNTs showed a high cell viability, but higher concentrations
of CNTs reduced cell viability. Swelling behavior of the hybrid hydrogels
was improved with CNT inclusion in the hydrogels. Swelling kinetics
of the CH–CNT hybrid hydrogels was found to follow the Fickian
behavior. Lysozyme digestion method was used to evaluate the in vitro
degradation property of the hydrogels, and the result showed that
nanotube inclusion lowered the degradation rate. However, a higher
concentration of CNTs (0.5%) showed a higher degradation rate compared
to a lower concentration of CNTs (0.1%). We also show that the CNT
decreased the amount of cumulative release of MTX-loaded hydrogels
compared with hydrogels without CNT. The CNT in the hydrogel allows
a slower and more controllable release behavior of MTX. The antitumor
effect of nanohybrid hydrogels on breast cancer cells shows that CH−β-GP–CNT
hydrogels loaded with MTX could enhance the inhibition effect on MCF-7
breast cancer cell growth. The study suggests that the hybrid hydrogels
of carbon nanomaterials and chitosan can function as injectable materials
for the anticancer drug delivery such as MTX. The drug delivery system
will contribute to the strategy of targeted therapy and sustainable
chemotherapy.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Preparation of Hydrogels
To prepare
the thermosensitive CH–CNT hydrogels, chitosan (2.5%) and CNT
(0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1%) were dissolved in acetic acid (0.05 M) using
magnetic stirring for 12–24 h and then sonicated for 1 h. A
solution of 40% (w/v) β-GP was also made in deionized water.
The solutions were placed in a refrigerator for 15–30 min.
Then, β-GP was added to the CH solution, mixed well at room
temperature. Then, the mixture was transferred to an incubator of
37 °C, and hydrogel was formed after a few minutes. For all biological
tests, the CH solutions were sterilized in an autoclave (121 °C,
20 min), and β-GP solutions were sterilized by filtration before
they were used to form a hydrogel.

4.2 Chemical
and Structural Analysis
The surface morphology of the prepared
CH–CNT hydrogels was
examined by scanning electron microscopy (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC,
Thornwood, NY). All lyophilized samples were lyophilized and coated
with gold before the SEM test. To understand about how the addition
of nanotubes affect the hydrophilicity of the prepared hydrogels,
the static sessile drop method was performed to measure the surface
water contact angle using a goniometer (CAM 100, KSV Instruments Ltd.,
Helsinki, Finland). A drop of Milli-Q water was placed on the film
surface, and the shape of the droplet was recorded as a function of
time with a FireWire connectable charge-coupled device camera with
50 mm optics.

To characterize the chemical structure of the
CH–CNT hydrogels, FTIR spectra were obtained using a Nicolet
FTIR spectrophotometer (Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR). All spectra
were within the range of 650–4000 cm–1 and
recorded by a transmittance mode. An XploRATM PLUS Raman spectrometer
(Horiba Scientific) was utilized to analyze the hydrogels at a wavelength
of 100–3200 cm–1 using a 532 nm laser.

The phase and crystallinity of the prepared hydrogels were evaluated
using X-ray diffraction. Measurements were performed using a fixed-anode
X-ray generator (Rigaku, Geigerflex, 40 kV and 30 mA) with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) and 2θ ranging from 10 to 60°.

4.3 In Vitro Biological Analysis
The
swelling test of the hydrogels was performed using the following method.
The weight of the samples was measured and soaked in a phosphate buffer
solution (PBS) (pH = 7) at 37 °C. At various time points, the
weight of the samples was measured after the excess liquid was carefully
wiped-off using filter papers. The swelling (SW) ratio was calculated
using the following equation  where W0 represents
the weight of the initial hydrogel and Ws is the weight of the wet hydrogel.

To investigate the biodegradability
of the hydrogels, the weight of the samples was accurately measured
and then placed in PBS for incubation at 37 °C in a shaking incubator.
The hydrogel degradation rate was tested by adding lysozyme (0.02
mg/mL) into the PBS. At various time points, the hydrogels were removed
from the incubation medium and weighed. Weight reduction was determined
by calculating the difference of the dry mass of the sample before
and after incubation.

The alamarBlue assay (Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL) was utilized
to test the viability of cells grown on the CH−β-GP–CNT
hydrogels. The hydrogels were prepared in the wells of a 24-well plate
and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The hydrogels were then
seeded with 3T3 fibroblast cells, and the cells were cultured for
4 days. To perform the alamarBlue test, the reagent (10% v/v) was
added to the cell culture well and incubated at 37 °C. After
4 h, the cell culture medium was transferred to a 96-well plate, and
the absorbance of the medium was measured at 570 and 600 nm using
a Synergy Mx Monochromator-Based Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Winooski,
VT). The samples with hydrogel alone were used as a control study.
The cell viability was calculated according to the absorbance value.

The releasing profile of MTX from the MTX-loaded hydrogels into
PBS was studied. The MTX was mixed with the CH−β-GP solution
with various amounts of CNT (0, 0.1, and 0.5%) at room temperature.
The hydrogel with MTX was formed after incubation of the solution
in an incubator of 37 °C. The MTX-loaded hydrogels were immersed
in the PBS solution, and the released MTX at various time intervals
was measured. The cell culture medium (1 mL) was changed, collected,
and the old medium was collected at each time point. The MTX level
in the collected medium was tested using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(Hitachi-2900 Spectrophotometer) at 303 nm.

To study their antitumor
efficiency of released MTX, the breast
cancer cells (MCF-7) were grown on the MTX-loaded hydrogels. The antiproliferative
effect of the released MTX on MCF-7 breast cancer cells was tested
by the alamarBlue assay.

4.4 Statistical Analysis
The data are
presented as mean ± standard deviation for n = 3 values. Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-tailed
Student t-test. The p-value of less
than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
