Synthetic
approaches toward multigram preparation of spirocyclic
α,α-disubstituted pyrrolidines from readily available
starting materials are discussed. It was shown that although a number
of synthetic methodologies have been known to date, many of the title
compounds remain hardly accessible. The most appropriate literature
method (which relied on reaction of imines and allyl magnesium halide,
followed by bromocyclization) was identified and optimized. It was
found that the method is most fruitful for simple non-functionalized
substrates. Two novel approaches based on the Sakurai or Petasis reactions
of cyclic ketones, followed by hydroboration–oxidation at the
allyl moiety thus introduced, were elaborated. The latter method had
the largest scope and was beneficial for the substrates containing
organosulfur or protected amino functions. For the synthesis of 4-azaspiro[2.4]heptane,
an alternative synthetic scheme commencing from tert-butyl cyclopropanecarboxylate (instead of the corresponding ketone)
was developed. It was shown that the whole set of the methodologies
developed can be used for the synthesis of various spirocyclic α,α-disubstituted
pyrrolidines—advanced building blocks of potential importance
to medicinal and agrochemistry—at up to a 100 g scale.

Introduction
For nearly two decades,
the concepts like “escape the flatland”,
“conformational restriction”, and “scaffold hopping”
have remained the major hallmarks of medicinal chemistry.1−3 The resulting shift from “traditional” drug design
based mainly on (hetero)aromatic cores toward sp3-enriched,
3D-shaped templates prompted more sophisticated methodologies to produce
medicinally relevant molecules. Nevertheless, as shown by a number
of recent analyses, the majority of medicinal chemists do not easily
accept novel synthetic methods and still prefer to use well-known,
robust procedures in their synthetic planning.4 Possible (and somewhat overlooked) design strategies to address
this issue rely on the use of advanced building blocks, in many cases
available from commercial sources. It is not surprising therefore
that synthesis of three-dimensional building blocks with a high fraction
of sp3-hybridized carbon atoms (Fsp3) has become
a part of the industry.5 The criteria for
these compounds were recently reviewed by Goldberg et al. from AstraZeneca.6 Low-molecular-weight spirocyclic motifs can be
examples of such building blocks; in 2010, they were outlined as a
class of compounds highly relevant to drug discovery by Carreira and
co-workers.7,8 As part of our ongoing efforts on design
and synthesis of advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry,9 we turned our attention to pyrrolidines with
a spirocyclic moiety attached at the α carbon atom of the heteroaliphatic
ring (i.e., 1-azaspiro[4.n]alkanes and their hetera-substituted
analogues). Derivatives of these building blocks are presented with
highly potent compounds demonstrating a wide range of biological effects
(Figure 1).10 Furthermore, over 5,000 1-azaspiro[4.n]alkane derivatives or their hetera-analogues with annotated
biological activity were retrieved by a quick substructure search
in the Reaxys database.11

Figure 1 Representative examples
of biologically active 1-azaspiro[4.n]alkanes.

In this work, we describe our
synthetic efforts toward multigram
preparation of the smallest spirocyclic α,α-disubstituted
pyrrolidines 1a–1r for our in-house
medchem project as well as building block collection enhancement shown
in Figure 2. Over the
last 10 years, derivatives of the compounds 1a–1e, 1i, 1p, and 1r were
broadly represented in patents, while other members of the series
remained unknown to date (Table 1).

Despite their well-documented biological activity,
synthesis of
these compounds is not described properly in the literature. In particular,
only three spirocyclic pyrrolidines (i.e., 1d, 1e, and 1p) were described as the free amines,
and four more (1a–1c and 1r) as the corresponding N-protected derivatives (Table 1). The known approaches to assemble
the spirocyclic core of 1-azaspiro[4.n]alkanes and
their hetera-analogues are summarized in Figure 3. The historically first and very straightforward
approach was described for the preparation of the compound 1d in 1957 (method A); it was based on the three-step synthetic sequence
commencing from cyclic nitro compounds.15 Since then, a number of alternative synthetic schemes were elaborated.
In 2013, Perry and co-workers described a reductive cyclization of
α-amino nitrile derivatives mediated by lithium di-tert-butyl biphenylide (LiDBB), which were made by double alkylation
of aminoacetonitrile derivatives (method B).13 In 2016, Um et al. developed an intermolecular Cu-catalyzed carboamination
of cyclic vinylarenes with potassium N-carbamoyl-β-aminoethyltrifluoroborate
(method C).20 At the same time, Yu et al.
applied the gold-catalyzed tandem reductive cycloisomerization of
cyclic homopropargyl sulfonamides for the synthesis of N-tosyl-protected compound 1c (method D).14 In 2017, Skvorcova and co-workers studied a
rearrangement of N-protected spirocyclic (cyclopropylmethyl)amines
promoted with trifluoroacetic acid (method E).17 A related approach was described by Shi et al.; it relied
on the Au(I)-catalyzed reaction of methylenecyclopropanes with sulfonamides
via a domino ring-opening–ring-closing–hydroamination
sequence (method F).16 The approach was
illustrated by the synthesis of two examples of Ts-protected spiropyrrolidines.

Figure 3 Known
approaches A–G for the synthesis of spirocyclic α,α-disubstituted
pyrrolidines.

However, the aforementioned
methods have their own drawbacks when
their application for multigram (at least ∼20 g6) and cost-effective synthesis of building blocks is considered.
These drawbacks include the use of uncommon, hazardous, or toxic reagents
and/or catalysts, multistep reaction sequences, and/or limited substrate
scope (Table 2). Herein,
we have turned our attention to the method described by chemists from
AstraZeneca (Scheme 3, G),18 which relied on bromine-mediated
cyclization of a cyclic homoallylamine derivative with subsequent
catalytic debromination. In our hands, this synthetic sequence was
reproduced at a 30 g scale with 27% overall yield (36% at the last
step). Therefore, we considered this strategy as a starting point
for further optimization.

Results and Discussion
The initial optimization of the literature method started with
minor modifications of the reaction conditions. At the first step,
simple refluxing of ketones 2b–2d and benzylamine in toluene with a Dean–Stark trap for 1 h
was used (Scheme 1).
This resulted in the formation of imines 3b–3d in nearly quantitative yields, which could be used in the
next step after removal of the solvent without any additional purification.
For the second step, allylmagnesium bromide was replaced with more
accessible allylmagnesium chloride (commercially available, 2 M in
THF); thus, the solvent was also changed to THF. These minor modifications
did not affect the yield of the products 4b–4d, which exceeded 90% in all cases studied. Further steps
of the reaction sequence (4b–4d → 6b–6d) were performed in a one-pot manner,
including subsequent addition of 40% aq HBr, Br2, and Et3N to a solution of 4b–4d in
CH2Cl2. We found this modification of the protocol
to be more robust and convenient for scale-up as compared to the literature
method (i.e., addition of in situ generated methanolic HBr, Br2, and aq K2CO3 to a solution of the
substrate in MeOH–CH2Cl2). The crude
products 6b–6d were obtained in nearly
quantitative yield with at least 90% purity.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Spirocyclic
Pyrrolidines (Approach I)
The final transformations of the reaction sequence, that
is, removal
of the bromine atom and catalytic debenzylation, were performed as
two separate steps. In particular, the products 6b–6d were reduced with LiAlH4 to give 7b–7d, which in turn were subjected to catalytic
hydrogenolysis leading to the formation of the target spirocyclic
pyrrolidines 1b–1d. The desired products
were isolated as hydrochlorides in 71–74% yields (over two
steps). Therefore, all the minor improvements of the procedures allowed
increasing the overall yield of the target products to 62–67%.
Moreover, spirocyclic pyrrolidines 1e, 1h, 1i, and 1j bearing a seven-membered ring
or cyclic ether moiety could be also obtained as hydrochlorides in
66–74% overall yields (Table 3).

Unfortunately, the synthetic scheme (i.e., approach I) was not
fruitful with the compounds 1f, 1k, and 1m bearing the thioether moieties due to their partial oxidation
at the bromination step, as well as issues with catalytic debenzylation.
Compound 1g bearing a sulfone group could be obtained
in moderate overall yield (42%); in this case, the reductive debromination
step was problematic (48% yield). Similar issues were observed with
the products 1p and 1r. Unfortunately, no
further improvement of the overall yields could be achieved for these
compounds.

Therefore, alternative synthetic schemes to avoid
the problematic
steps mentioned above had been considered (approach II, Scheme 2). For starters, we decided
to use the Cbz protective group instead of the benzyl moiety. To this
end, the Sakurai reaction of ketones 2 with readily available
allyltrimethylsilane and O-benzyl carbamate21 was selected. The HBF4·Et2O catalyst, which was used in the previous publication referenced
above was replaced with more common BF3·Et2O, which is also more convenient for the scale-up. This replacement,
as well decreasing the reaction temperature from rt to 0 °C and
changing the solvent from CH3CN to CH2Cl2, resulted in an increase of the yield of the intermediate 8d from 56 to 74% (as compared to the literature procedure).
Moreover, this yield was maintained when the reaction was performed
at up to a 100 g scale.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Spirocyclic Pyrrolidines (Approach
II)
Further, part of the synthetic
sequence was also altered significantly.
In particular, cyclization of mesylates 10 was considered
as the key step for the construction of the pyrrolidine ring. The
compounds 10 were obtained via hydroboration–oxidation
of the product 8, followed by mesylation of the resulting
alcohol 9. In this part of the synthetic scheme, the
hydroboration–oxidation step seemed to be the most problematic
for the scale-up. Nevertheless, 71–83% yields could still be
achieved. It should be noted that the use of freshly prepared borane
(by reaction of NaBH4 and I2) was critical at
this step. All the experiments with common commercial sources of BH3 led to the diminished yields of alcohol 9.

The final step of the synthetic sequence (approach II) included
Pd-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of the Cbz moiety. The products 1b, 1d, 1e, and 1o (whose
synthesis was not tested via approach I) were obtained as hydrochlorides
in 43–56% overall yields (Table 3).

All our attempts to adjust the aforementioned
reaction sequence
for the preparation of the compounds 1f and 1m bearing the thioether moiety were not fruitful. The presence of
the sulfur (II) atom made the catalytic hydrogenolysis (General Procedure xi) impossible. Other methods
of the Cbz group cleavage (i.e., refluxing with concd aq HBr or Me3SiI) led to partial decomposition of the thioether ring so
that the products were obtained in low yield and with modest purity.
Nevertheless, approach II was efficient for the preparation of the
Cbz-protected derivative 11m, which could be easily converted
to SO2-containg product 11n via oxidation
with the RuCl3–NaIO4 system. Deprotection
of 11n by catalytic hydrogenolysis (General Procedure xi) led to the target product 1n in 31% overall yield (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Spirocyclic
Pyrrolidine 1n (Approach II)
To obtain the target products 1f and 1m using approach II, the Cbz protective group had to be replaced
with
carboxyethyl (Scheme 4). To achieve this, ethyl carbamate was used in the Sakurai reaction,
which led to the corresponding products 12f and 12m. Further transformations of 12f and 12m followed General Procedures viii–x described above for the Cbz counterparts
and led to the spirocyclic compounds 15f and 15m. Finally, the target products 1f and 1m were obtained as hydrochlorides in 22 and 25% overall yield, respectively,
by reaction of 15f and 15m with hydrazine
hydrate and KOH in ethylene glycol at 155 °C.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Sulfur-Containing
Spirocyclic Pyrrolidines 1f and 1m (Approach
II)
Despite many derivatives of
general formula 1 could
be obtained using approach II, for some of them (e.g., sulfur-containing
compounds), the overall yields remained far from being excellent.
Therefore, one more synthetic sequence was elaborated (approach III),
which started with preparation of compounds 16 by the
Petasis reaction of ketones 2, pinacol allylboronate,
and NH3 in methanol (Scheme 5). The main advantage of this method is formation of
product 16 as a free amine so that any protective group
can be installed at the nitrogen atom in further transformations.
In particular, Boc protection was used to obtain the sulfur-containing
spirocyclic pyrrolidines 1f, 1k, and 1l via the typical reaction sequence discussed above (General Procedures viii–x); the target products were obtained as hydrochlorides in
39–49% overall yield. It should be outlined that approach III
appeared to be more fruitful as compared to approach II in terms of
the overall yield (39 vs 22%, respectively, in the case of 1f; Table 3).

Scheme 5 Synthesis
of Sulfur-Containing Spiropyrrolidines 1f, 1k, and 1l (Approach III)
Another variation of this approach relied on the use of
trifluoroacetyl
as the protecting group. In this case, the method could be extended
to Boc-protected piperidones 2p and 2r (Scheme 6). The corresponding
products of the Petasis reaction 16p and 16r were trifluoroacetylated, and the resulting orthogonally protected
diamines 17p and 17r were introduced into
the typical reaction sequence discussed above (General Procedures viii–x). Removal of the trifluoroacetyl group in the products 20p and 20r thus obtained accomplished the synthesis of N-Boc-monoprotected diamines 1p and 1r (43 and 31% overall yield, respectively).

Scheme 6 Synthesis of N-Boc-Monoprotected Diamines 1p and 1r (Approach III)
In our opinion, approach III can be considered as the
most convenient
of the methods discussed herein for “challenging” spirocyclic
pyrrolidines bearing an additional functional group. Nevertheless,
none of the approaches I–III can be applied for those synthetic
targets where the corresponding cyclic ketone 2 is not
accessible or even unstable. This was the case with 4-azaspiro[2.4]heptane
(1a) bearing the cyclopropyl moiety. We assumed that
an alternative approach to the key intermediate 17a,
which would not require formation of unstable cyclopropanone (2a), should be elaborated to accomplish synthesis of 1a (Scheme 7). To this end, it turned out that tert-butyl cyclopropylcarboxylate
(21a) can be an appropriate starting compound. Compound 17a was obtained from 21a in 50% yield over three
steps including allylation,22 acidic hydrolysis,
and modified Curtius rearrangement. Further transformations of 17a followed the typical synthetic sequence used in this work
(General Procedures viii–x and xiv) and led
to the target compound 1a as hydrochloride (24% overall
yield).

Scheme 7 Synthesis of 4-Azaspiro[2.4]heptane (1a) (Approach
IV)
It should be noted that several
spirocyclic pyrrolidines obtained
in this work (compounds 1i–1n and 1r) contained an asymmetric carbon atom. We have demonstrated
that they can be obtained as pure enantiomers via preparative chiral
stationary phase chromatography for the case of the compound 1n. Separation was achieved for the Cbz derivative 11n using a Chiralcel OD-H column (hexane–i-PrOH–MeOH
(60:20:20) as eluent). Both enantiomers (R)-1n and (S)-1n were obtained
after deprotection of (R)-11n and (S)-11n (General Procedure
xi). Absolute configuration of these compounds was determined
by X-ray diffraction studies for the hydrochloride (R)-1n·HCl (Figure 4).

Conclusions
It
is a common situation in organic chemistry and drug discovery
that some compounds, although appearing to be described in the literature
via a number of published synthetic methodologies, become challenging
targets when their preparation for industrial use or even late-stage
R&D is necessary. It often happens when multigram scale-up (to
∼100 g, in some cases – even ∼10 g) and extension
of the scope toward “inconvenient” functionalized substrates
are required – a problem highlighted by Churcher and co-workers
in their recent perspective.23 As part
of our ongoing research on medicinally relevant building blocks, we
faced such a problem in the case of spirocyclic pyrrolidines. This
resulted in development of four synthetic approaches (one being an
optimization of the literature method), which were used for the preparation
of 17 building blocks at the multigram scale. It was found that approach
I (based on the method of Jenkins et al.18) was optimal for the simplest non-functionalized substrates, which
were obtained from common cyclic ketones in 62–74% overall
yield. Approach II, which was based on the Sakurai reaction, partially
solved the problems with sulfur-containing substrates; however, the
overall yields of the target products diminished (43–56% for
the simplest representatives and 22–31% for the organosulfur
derivatives). Approach III, which relied on the Petasis reaction,
appeared to be the most general since it allowed for the largest variation
of the protective groups for the key intermediates. In particular,
it was efficient in the case of either sulfur-containing products
(39–49% overall yield) or monoprotected spirocyclic diamines
(31–43% overall yield). Finally, approach IV was developed
for those substrates where the corresponding cyclic ketone is not
available. Its utility was demonstrated for the smallest representative
of the series studied—4-azaspiro[2.4]heptane, which was obtained
in 24% total yield. The developed synthetic schemes included 5–7
steps, commenced from readily available starting materials, were scalable
up to 100 g, and led to biologically relevant spirocyclic pyrrolidines—advanced
building blocks for drug discovery, which can be now considered as
readily available to the chemical community.

Ketone 2 (1.0
mol) was dissolved in dry toluene (1500 mL), and benzylamine (1.0
mol, 105 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 1 h
with a Dean–Stark trap and an effective condenser until complete
water separation (18 mL). Toluene was evaporated, and the obtained
product was used in the next step without further purification.

The obtained crude compound 3 (1.0 mol) was dissolved
in THF (2000 mL) and cooled to −20 °C. A solution of allylmagnesium
chloride in THF (2 M, 500 mL) was added dropwise to the obtained solution
for 30 min keeping the reaction mixture temperature below −15
°C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to rt and left overnight.
A saturated solution of NH4Cl (∼500 mL) was added
for complete precipitation of magnesium salts. The organic layer was
separated, and the THF layer was dried under Na2SO4 and was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was
distilled in vacuum (0.2 mmHg).

General Procedures iii and iv
Compound 4 (0.95 mol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (2000 mL)
and was added to the 48% aqueous solution of HBr (0.95 mol, 240 mL).
Then, Br2 (1 mol, 500 mL) was slowly added dropwise to
the obtained mixture for 1 h keeping the temperature below 25 °C.
The resulting mixture was cooled to rt and left for 1 h resulting
in formation of 5.

Triethylamine (1.5 mol, 110
mL) was added dropwise at rt to the obtained solution of 5 in General Procedure iii for 25–30
min keeping the temperature below 25 °C (Caution: exothermic process). The resulting solution was left at rt for
1 h. Distilled water (500 mL) was added to the solution to extract
all water-soluble impurities and triethylammonium bromide. The organic
layer was separated and dried over Na2SO4, and
the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained product 6 with a purity of approximately 90% was used in the next
step without further purification. The analytical samples were additionally
purified by flash column chromatography.

General Procedure ix
i-Pr2NEt (0.35 mol, 34 mL) (triethylamine (0.35 mol, 26
mL) in the case
of 19k) was added to a solution of alcohol 9, 13, or 18 (0.30 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (1400 mL). The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C,
and a solution of methanesulfonyl chloride (0.31 mol, 53 mL) in CH2Cl2 (140 mL) was added dropwise for 45 min. The
mixture was further stirred at 0 °C for 30 min and overnight
at rt. In the case of 19a, the solution was stirred for
3 h at ambient temperature, and complete conversion was confirmed
by NMR spectroscopy. An aqueous solution of citric acid (10%, 1000
mL) was added and stirred for 10 min. Layers were separated; the organic
layer was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (560 mL) and brine (560 mL) (only a solution of NaHCO3 was used in the case of 19a). The organic layer was
dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated. The residue
was used in the next step without further purification.

In the
case of 19r and 19p, the alcohol (0.257
mol) was dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (1250 mL),
and then DIPEA (0.308 mol, 30 mL) and mesyl chloride (0.27 mol, 46
mL) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight, washed
with 10% citric acid solution (200 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated.

The analytical samples were additionally
purified by flash column
chromatography.

General Procedure x
NaH (60% in mineral oil, 0.48 mol,
11.5 g) was added in portions of solutions of mesylate 10, 14, or 19 (0.32 mol) in THF (3200 mL)
over 30 min. The reaction mixture was heated to 60 °C and was
stirred overnight at this temperature. Then, THF was evaporated and
a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl (1600 mL) was carefully
added. In the case of 20a, 20r, and 20p, distilled water (1420 mL) instead of an aqueous solution
of NH4Cl was used. The product was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 600 mL). The organic layer was dried
over Na2SO4 and evaporated. The residue was
purified by flash column chromatography to give the desired product.
