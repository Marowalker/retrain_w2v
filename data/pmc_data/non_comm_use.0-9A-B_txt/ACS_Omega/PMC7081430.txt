Since large amounts of pineapple
leaves are abandoned after harvest
in agricultural areas, the possibility of developing value-added products
from them is of interest. In this work, cellulose fiber was extracted
from pineapple leaves and modified with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) and carboxymethyl (CM) groups to produce Cell-EDTA and
Cell-CM, respectively, which were then used as heavy metal ion adsorbents.
A solution of either lead ion (Pb2+) or cadmium ion (Cd2+) was used as wastewater for the purpose of studying adsorption
efficiencies. The adsorption efficiencies of Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM
were significantly higher than those of the unmodified cellulose in
the pH range 1–7. Maximum adsorptions toward Pb2+ and Cd2+ were, for Cell-EDTA, 41.2 and 33.2 mg g–1, respectively, and, for Cell-CM, 63.4 and 23.0 mg
g–1, respectively. The adsorption behaviors of Cell-CM
for Pb2+ and Cd2+ fitted well with a pseudo-first-order
model, but those of Cell-EDTA for Pb2+ and Cd2+ fitted well with a pseudo-second-order model. All of the adsorption
behaviors could be described using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
Desorption studies of Pb2+ and Cd2+ on both
adsorbents using 1 M HCl suggested that regenerability of Cell-EDTA
was, for both adsorbates, better than that of Cell-CM. Moreover, adsorption
measurements in a mixture of Pb2+ and Cd2+ at
various ratios showed that for both adsorbents the adsorption of Pb2+ was higher than that of Cd2+, while the adsorption
selectivity for Pb2+ of Cell-CM was greater than that of
Cell-EDTA. This study showed that the modified cellulosic adsorbents
made from pineapple leaves were able to efficiently adsorb metal ions.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
use of biomass residues as feedstock for sustainable energy
and material innovation development has become a challenging field
of research. Intensively cultivated in Thailand and an important crop
in terms of revenue, pineapple contributes a potential biomass feedstock.
Very large amounts of pineapple leaf (PAL) are generated and subsequently
abandoned after the fruit harvest. The leaves are not suitable for
fuel production and cattle feed; hence, it is of great interest to
find a use for PAL as a resource for the production of products with
added value.

In general, dried PAL consists of α-cellulose
(74.5–87.2%),
hemi-cellulose (12.3–20.4%), lignin (3.46–8.7%), and
other components (water, wax, oil, fat, pectin, tannin), with quantities
depending on the type of pineapple and the location of the harvest
area. Cellulose fiber is part of the cell wall of PAL consisting of d-glucose (C6H12O6) polymers
involving a β 1-4 glycosidic bond, and it may be in crystalline
and/or amorphous forms. Due to the unit linkage of d-glucose
needed to form polymer chains and the hydrogen bonding within the
molecule, cellulose fiber is naturally strong and tough. Normally,
cellulose fiber extracted from PAL can be obtained using an acid solution
(HCl or H2SO4) or alkaline solution (NaOH, known
as a soda process) in the first step. After that, a bleaching process
(NaClO or NaClO2) is carried out to eliminate residual
lignin, and subsequently, the purified cellulose fiber is produced.1−3 Cellulose fiber commonly contains a hydroxyl group, which can be
reacted with numerous reagents to provide different, useful derivatives;
these are used in various applications, including as reinforcement
agent composites in materials,4−7 biomedical engineering,8,9 and adsorbents.10−12

Heavy metal contamination in the environment is a serious
concern
worldwide. The ions of those metals are highly toxic to the environment,
as well as to animals and humans, in the event that the ions contaminate
water resources.10,13−15 Therefore,
having effective technology to treat these metal ions is vital. Adsorption
using an adsorbent is one of the most effective methods to reduce
the number of metal ions in water due to the fact that the process
is relatively simple, low in cost, and highly efficient. More importantly,
advantages increase when the adsorbent can be regenerated16,17 and disposed after use.17,18

Several papers
have reported on the modification of cellulose extracted
from different natural resources—such as wood sawdust,19 corncob,20 orange
peel,21,22 and sugarcane bagasse23−25—for
use as metal ion adsorbents. Due to the low adsorption efficiency
of the hydroxyl group of the extracted cellulose, this group must
be modified before it can be used in practice. Examples of functional
groups bonded to extracted cellulose to increase its adsorption efficiency
include carboxyl,26 amidoxime,27,28 amide,29 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA),18,25 sulfur as an anionic ligand,30 and triethylenetetramine.31,32 Common metal ions that are studied include Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, and Ni.16,18,30,33−36 It was found that the adsorption efficiencies of these modified
celluloses were clearly higher than those of the unmodified cellulose.

The elimination of Pb2+ and Cd2+ from wastewater
or natural water has been of particular interest in many studies,37,38 because these two heavy metal ions can have severe adverse effects
on human health and the environment, as stated earlier. Indeed, a
number of studies have reported on the use of different modified cellulosic
adsorbents for the adsorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+. Gurgel et al. used mercerized sugarcane bagasse with succinic anhydride
for removal of Pb2+ and Cd2+.24 The authors demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of
modified mercerized sugarcane bagasse exhibited an increase for both
Pb2+ (83 mg g–1) and Cd2+ (44
mg g–1) relative to modified nonmercerized sugarcane
bagasse; this result was due to the increase in the number of introduced
carboxylic acid groups. Furthermore, another research group modified
mercerized sugarcane bagasse with ethylenediaminetetraacetic dianhydride
(EDTAD), achieving the highest adsorption capacities of 333 and 149
mg g–1 for Pb2+ and Cd2+,
respectively. EDTAD was also used by d’Halluin et al. to modify
cellulose fiber paper.18 Their modified
cellulosic adsorbent was very robust and had high hydrophilicity,
disposability, and low toxicity. The adsorption efficiencies obtained
were 227 and 102 mg g–1 for Pb2+ and
Cd2+, respectively.

Considering the high adsorption
efficiency, wide availability,
high disposability and efficiency, and inexpensive methodology associated
with modified cellulosic adsorbents prepared from modifications of
cellulose with either carboxylic acid or EDTA group, the current study,
therefore, used PAL as a new source of cellulose for developing modified
cellulosic adsorbents for removal of Pb2+ and Cd2+. These modified celluloses were used to study the adsorption of
Pb2+ and/or Cd2+ in both single and binary metal
ion systems. The regenerability of the adsorbents was also investigated
using a solution of 1 M HCl. Moreover, adsorption isotherms and adsorption
kinetic models (pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models)
were used to investigate the behavior of the adsorbent–adsorbate
system.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 PAL Composition
Compositions of the
PAL determined using the TAPPI standard method are presented in Figure 1. It was found that
the total amounts of extractives (fat, wax, oil, tannin, pectin) in
ethanol + benzene, ethanol, and hot water were about 40%. Moreover,
the amount of α-cellulose (35.4 ± 5.4%) was greater than
that of hemi-cellulose (16.6 ± 0.4%). This high amount of α-cellulose
relative to that of hemi-cellulose can be advantageous when using
PAL as a natural source for turning it into adsorbents. The remaining
constituents consisted of lignin and ash (about 16% in total). Moreover,
although the amount of α-cellulose seemed to be too low for
economic utilization, the use of α-cellulose in this work can
still be considered to demonstrate and develop a good methodology
of adsorption studies for academic and industrial purposes.

Note that holo-cellulose (44.60%) is the combination of α-cellulose
and hemi-cellulose.

2.2 Modifications
of the Extracted Cellulose
The extracted cellulose products
before and after modification
with the EDTA or carboxymethyl (CM) group were characterized using
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), as shown in Figure 2. For the extracted cellulose, the observed
broad peak around 3600–3200 cm–1 was assigned
to the −OH stretching vibration. The band at 2890 cm–1, meanwhile, belonged to the stretching vibrational mode of C–H,
while the bands at 1428, 1364, 1320, 1025, and 896 cm–1 were ascribed to the stretching and bending vibrations of the −CH2, −CH, −OH, and C–O bonds in the cellulose
backbone.39 For Cell-EDTA, a new and strong
adsorption peak at a wavelength of 1588 cm–1 appeared,
which was an indication of the carboxyl group (O=C–O– stretching).40,41 In addition, there
was a stronger adsorption peak at around 1400–1300 cm–1, which was an indication of the C–N stretching vibration
of the EDTA group.41 This suggested that
the EDTA group had been successfully substituted onto the cellulose
backbone during the modification. In the spectra of Cell-CM, two new
observed peaks at wavelengths of 1727 and 1639 cm–1 appeared; the former band was assigned to the C=O stretching
of the carboxyl group,42 while the latter
was assigned to the adsorption of H2O onto Cell-CM.43,44 The bands around 1450–1300 cm–1, ascribed
to the vibrations of C–O and −OH of the carboxyl group,
overlapped with the bands of the −CH2, −CH,
−OH, and C–O bonds in the cellulose backbone. Nonetheless,
this suggested that the −OH groups of the extracted cellulose
could be successfully substituted with the carboxymethyl group.

of extracted cellulose, Cell-EDTA, and Cell-CM.

In addition, the physical morphologies and the elemental compositions
of the extracted cellulose, Cell-CM, and Cell-EDTA were examined using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDS); see Figure 3. All three samples had a long fiber structure with an average diameter
of 5–8 μm. The EDS analysis showed that the surface of
each sample of cellulose mainly consisted of the cellulose backbone
(C and O). The EDS spectra of the surfaces of Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM
revealed the existence of N atoms on the former and Na atoms on the
latter. Both the FT-IR and EDS results verified that there had been
successful modifications of the extracted cellulose with the desired
functional groups, EDTA and carboxymethyl.

compositions of extracted cellulose,

2.3 Adsorption
Studies of Extracted Cellulose,
Cell-EDTA, and Cell-CM with Pb2+ and Cd2+
EDS analyses after adsorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ are presented in Figure 4. A peak for Pb or Cd appeared on the spectra of the extracted
cellulose, Cell-EDTA, and Cell-CM after performing the metal ion adsorption,
confirming that Pb2+ or Cd2+ was adsorbed on
the surface of the samples. Moreover, the results demonstrated that
the adsorption mechanism of Cell-CM was ion exchange between the Na+ of Cell-CM and Pb2+ or Cd2+ from the
solution,45 as indicated by the disappearance
of Na+ atoms (Figure 4, Cell-CM/Pb and Cell-CM/Cd). For Cell-EDTA, the adsorption
mechanism was covalent coordination, which happens due to the ability
of the EDTA group to adsorb metal ions by chemisorption.18

Figure 4 Elemental compositions after adsorption of Pb or Cd using
extracted
cellulose, Cell-EDTA, and Cell-CM. Conditions for adsorption: concentration
of Pb2+ or Cd2+ = 100 mg L–1, pH = 6, at room temperature for 90 min.

To further characterize the samples after adsorption with Pb2+ or Cd2+, they were analyzed by FT-IR, and the
spectra were compared with those before adsorption, as presented in Figure 5. For the extracted
cellulose (Figure 5a), all of the bands of the samples after adsorption were very similar
to those before adsorption, which might be due to the very low adsorption
of the metal ions by the extracted cellulose. For Cell-EDTA (Figure 5b) and Cell-CM (Figure 5c), it was clearly
observed that the band indicating the O=C–O– stretching of the EDTA group (1588 cm–1) and the
band indicating the C=O stretching of the carboxyl group (1727
cm–1) almost disappeared, which suggested that the
EDTA or carboxymethyl group participated in the coordination.46 The characteristic absorption bands of Pb–O
and Cd–O are normally observed at around 700–400 cm–1,47,48 but they overlapped with the
absorption bands of the adsorbents; thus, identifying them was difficult.

temperature for 90 min.

2.3.1 Effect
of pH on the Adsorption Efficiency
of Cellulose, Cell-EDTA, and Cell-CM
The effect of the pH
of the metal ion solutions on the adsorption efficiency of the modified
celluloses was studied, and a comparison was made with the case of
the extracted cellulose (Figure 6). The pH values for the study were varied in the range
of 1–7. It can be clearly seen that the optimal adsorption
efficiencies of the extracted cellulose, Cell-EDTA, and Cell-CM fell
in the pH range 5–7. Specifically, the maximum adsorption efficiencies
of Cell-EDTA were about 40 mg g–1 for Pb2+ and 33 mg g–1 for Cd2+, while the maximum
adsorption efficiencies of Cell-CM were about 63 mg g–1 for Pb2+ and 23 mg g–1 for Cd2+. Meanwhile, at approximately 7 mg g–1 for Pb2+ and 4 mg g–1 for Cd2+, the
maximum adsorption efficiencies of the extracted cellulose were much
lower than those of Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM. For pH values from 1 to
3, the adsorption efficiencies of all three samples decreased with
reducing pH values, owing to the change in the number of protons in
the solution. When the number of protons increased (by lowering the
pH), the metal ions had to compete with protonation of the carboxyl
and carboxylate groups, and this increased the positive surface charge
of the adsorbent.18,27,49 At higher pH values, varying pH had a minimal effect on efficiency
(and thus a pH of 6 was preferred in later tests). Note that the adsorption
measurement could not be made with metal ion solutions above pH 7
due to the precipitation of the hydroxide forms of the metals.

Figure 6 Adsorption
efficiencies (qe) of extracted
cellulose, Cell-EDTA, and Cell-CM for (a) Pb2+ and (b)
Cd2+ in the pH range of 1–7. Conditions for adsorption:
concentration of Pb2+ or Cd2+ = 100 mg L–1, at room temperature for 90 min.

Although these two adsorbents cannot, in general, be compared because
the adsorption mechanisms of the adsorbent–adsorbate system
are different, this work will still discuss the specific adsorption
mechanism of each system and compare, in relative terms, the adsorption
efficiency as of a matter of interest.

It was interesting to
see that the adsorption efficiencies of Cell-CM
for Pb2+ were considerably higher than those of Cell-CM
for Cd2+, while the adsorption efficiencies of Cell-EDTA
for Pb2+ were only slightly higher than those of Cell-EDTA
for Cd2+. These differences were due to the influence of
the electronegativity of each metal on the formation of a chemical
bond with each adsorbent, which can be explained as follows. (i) The
adsorption on Cell-CM occurs by an ionic bond; thus, a higher electronegativity
of a metal results in a better exchange with a sodium ion, thereby
forming a better ionic bond. In other words, Pb2+ has a
much higher adsorption efficiency relative to Cd2+ since
the electronegativity of Pb (2.33) is much greater than that of Cd
(1.69). (ii) The adsorption on Cell-EDTA occurs by covalent coordinate
bonding (a shared pair of electrons); thus, a metal that has a higher
electronegativity (Pb) is able to share electrons with the EDTA group
better than a metal that has a lower electronegativity (Cd). Furthermore,
in comparisons using the same adsorbate, the adsorption efficiency
of Cell-CM for Pb2+ was higher than that of Cell-EDTA for
Pb2+, whereas the adsorption efficiency of Cell-CM for
Cd2+ was lower than that of Cell-EDTA for Cd2+. This may have been due to the fact that the influence of the adsorption
by ionic bonding was dominant when the adsorbate (Pb) had a very high
electronegativity. Nonetheless, adsorption by the covalent coordinate
bonding became dominant when the adsorbate (Cd) had a low electronegativity.
The adsorption efficiencies of the extracted cellulose were invariably
much lower than those of Cell-CM and Cell-EDTA, owing to the low adsorption
efficiency of the hydroxyl group.

2.3.2 Effect
of Contact Time on Metal Ion Adsorption
of Cellulose, Cell-EDTA, and Cell-CM
The time required for
adsorption of metal ions is an important factor requiring evaluation
in a study of the adsorption process. Figure 7 shows plots of the amounts of Pb2+ or Cd2+ adsorbed onto the extracted cellulose, Cell-EDTA,
and Cell-CM within 160 min; from these results, it is clear that the
adsorption efficiencies of the two modified celluloses were significantly
greater than that of the unmodified cellulose. It should be noted
that the experiments in this section were carried out at pH 6, with
this value being chosen based on the optimal range of values for pH
in Section 2.3.1. The maximum adsorption efficiencies of the extracted cellulose
for Pb2+ and Cd2+ were the lowest among the
samples, at 5.6 and 4.1 mg g–1, respectively. For
Cell-EDTA, the maximum adsorption efficiencies for Pb2+ and Cd2+ were 41.2 and 33.2 mg g–1,
respectively. Meanwhile, the adsorption efficiency values of Cell-CM
for Pb2+ and Cd2+ were 63.4 and 23.0 mg g–1, respectively. In other words, both Cell-EDTA and
Cell-CM gave higher adsorption efficiency for Pb2+ than
that for Cd2+. This is certainly because the electronegativity
of Pb (2.33) is greater than that of Cd (1.69), so the formation of
bonds between Pb2+ and the EDTA or CM group is more efficient.
In Figure 7, it can
also be seen that for both Pb2+ and Cd2+, Cell-CM
reached its maximum adsorption efficiency much faster than Cell-EDTA
(within about 13 min); in contrast, the adsorption efficiency of Cell-EDTA
gradually increased with time and, for both Pb2+ and Cd2+, reached equilibrium within about 90 min. These results
can perhaps be explained by the formation of ionic bonds being faster
than the formation of covalent coordinate bonds. In other words, the
covalent coordinate bonding involves a bond breakage and a bond formation
that can slow down the entire reaction, while the ionic bond formation
involves only an exchange of ions.

Figure 7 Effect of contact time on metal ion adsorption
of (a) Pb2+ and (b) Cd2+ onto extracted cellulose,
Cell-EDTA, and
Cell-CM. Conditions for adsorption: concentration of Pb2+ or Cd2+ = 100 mg L–1 at pH 6 and room
temperature.

It can also be seen in Figure 7a,b that the adsorption
efficiency of Cell-CM as regards
Pb2+ was significantly higher than that as regards Cd2+ (63.4 mg g–1 for Pb2+ and 23.0
mg g–1 for Cd2+), while the adsorption
efficiency of Cell-EDTA as regards Pb2+ and Cd2+ was slightly different (41.2 mg g–1 for Pb2+ and 33.2 mg g–1 for Cd2+).
The former result can be explained by the fact that because the adsorption
of the metal ions onto Cell-CM occurs by ionic bonding, the electronegativity
of each metal becomes the dominant cause of adsorption. That is, because
the electronegativity of Pb (2.33) is greater than that of Cd (1.69),
the adsorption efficiency of Cell-CM as regards Pb2+ is
much higher than that regarding Cd2+. However, in the case
of Cell-EDTA, adsorption of the metal ions occurs by covalent bonding;
the latter observation (regarding Cell-EDTA) can be explained on the
basis of calculating the energy required to form a chemical bond between
the adsorbent and the adsorbate (heat of formation). As no data have
been collected for the values of the heat formation of Cell-EDTA-Pb
and Cell-EDTA-Cd, the values for the heat formation of PdO (−51.72
kcal mol–1) and CdO (−62.35 kcal mol–1)50 might be used to explain
this behavior instead; such an approach suggests that the adsorption
efficiency of Cell-EDTA for Pb2+ is indeed greater than
that of Cell-EDTA for Cd2+. Moreover, the adsorption efficiencies
of Cell-EDTA that would be estimated based on the heat of formation
with these two metal ions did not appear to be significantly different,
which is in good agreement with the observations regarding actual
efficiencies.

Another interesting result observed in both Figure 7a,b was that the
adsorption efficiencies
of Cell-CM for Pb2+ were much greater than those of Cell-EDTA
for Pb2+ (Figure 7a). In contrast, the adsorption efficiencies of Cell-CM as
regards Cd2+ were, in the equilibrium state, slightly lower
than those of Cell-EDTA as regards Cd2+ (Figure 7b). For the case where the
metal ion or adsorbate possesses high electronegativity (Figure 7a), effects of bond
formation occurring by ionic bonding, which requires less energy,
could be dominant. Consequently, the adsorption of Pb2+ on Cell-CM is more effective than that on Cell-EDTA. Meanwhile,
for the case where the adsorbate possesses low electronegativity (Figure 7b), a complicated
system, which cannot be easily described, becomes dominant: many factors
have an effect on the adsorption efficiency, such as the number of
active sites per adsorbate, the specific interaction between the adsorbate
and each adsorbent, and the diffusion of the adsorbate in each adsorbent
medium.51

2.3.3 Kinetic
Models for Metal Ion Adsorption
of Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM
Data from the previous sections
can now be used to predict the kinetic behavior of adsorption. In
general, the linear forms of a pseudo-first-order model and a pseudo-second-order
model can be expressed using eqs 1 and 2, respectively52 1   2  where q1 and q2 are the number of adsorbed metal ions (mg
g–1) at equilibrium, qt is the number of adsorbed metal ions (mg g–1) at time t (min), and k1 and k2 are the rate constants.

The average experimental values of qt at time t of Pb2+ and
Cd2+ onto Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM from Figure 7 were re-plotted with nonlinear fitting curves
using the expressions of pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models,
as shown in Figure 8. The kinetic parameters (q1, q2, k1, and k2) and the statistical information (coefficient
of determination (R2), adjusted determination
coefficient (Radj2), sum of
squared errors (SSE),53 and Akaike’s
information criterion (AIC)54) were also
collected, as shown in Table 1. The formulas of SSE and AIC are shown in eqs 3 and 4, respectively 3   4  where N is the
number of
data points. qt,cal and qt,exp are the number of adsorbed
metal ions at the data point i; they are obtained
from the calculation regarding the nonlinear fitting and the experiment,
respectively. Np is the number of parameters
in the model.

kinetic models for the adsorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ onto (a) Cell-EDTA and (b) Cell-CM.

The important information
obtained from Figure 8 and Table 1 are as
follows. (i) The values of q1 and q2 represent the maximum
adsorption efficiency of each adsorbent–adsorbate system under
the performed conditions. All values of q2 were slightly greater than those of q1. (ii) The values of R2 and Radj2 cannot be used to determine with certainty
which model is the best linear fit with the experimental data.55 The values of SSE and AIC have to be considered
for making the final decision. According to SSE and AIC conventions,
the model that has a SSE value closer to zero and a smaller AIC value
is the best fit with experimental data. It can be seen from the results
that for the adsorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ onto
Cell-EDTA both the SSE and AIC values of the pseudo-first-order model
were significantly greater than those of the pseudo-second-order model,
indicating that the pseudo-second-order model fitted better with the
experimental data. (iii) For adsorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ onto Cell-CM, both the SSE and AIC values of the pseudo-first-order
model was meaningfully smaller than those of the pseudo-second-order
model. This suggests that the pseudo-first-order model fits better
with the experimental data here. The fact that Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM
follow different models may be a result of either the difference in
adsorbents or the concentration of the adsorbate.56

2.3.4 Isotherm of Metal Ion
Adsorption of Cell-EDTA
and Cell-CM
The adsorption behaviors of Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM
were investigated by plotting data fit to both the Langmuir isotherm
and the Freundlich isotherm, as presented in Figure 9. In general, the Langmuir isotherm is used
to describe the adsorption behavior of a chemisorption monolayer at
the surface of an adsorbent57 and can be
expressed using eq 5(52) 5  where qe is the
number of adsorbed metal ions at equilibrium (mg g–1), qm is the maximum adsorption capacity
of the adsorbent (mg g–1), Ce is the concentration of metal ions in solution at equilibrium
(mg L–1), and kL (L
mg–1) is the Langmuir constant.

Figure 9 Equilibrium curves for
the adsorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ onto (a) Cell-EDTA
and (b) Cell-CM. Conditions for adsorption:
concentration of Pb2+ or Cd2+ in the range of
30–160 mg L–1 at pH 6 and room temperature.

The Freundlich isotherm, meanwhile, is used to
describe the adsorption
behavior on heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces, assuming that multilayer
adsorption takes place on a heterogeneous surface. Equation 6 gives the linearized Freundlich
isotherm model52,58 6  where qe (mg g–1) is the adsorption
capacity at equilibrium, Ce is the concentration
of metal in solution
at equilibrium (mg L–1), and kF and 1/nF are the empirical Freundlich
constants associated with the capacity and intensity of adsorption,
respectively.

A full list of the adsorption parameters and the
statistical values
(SSE and AIC) associated with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms
can be found in Table 2. The SSE and AIC values were used to determine which adsorption
model had a better goodness fit with the experimental data. These
values were established based on nonlinear fitting analysis. It can
be seen that for both Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM and for both metal ions
the R2 and Radj2 values associated with the Langmuir isotherms are greater
than those associated with the Freundlich isotherms and the SSE and
AIC values associated with the Langmuir isotherms are significantly
smaller than those associated with the Freundlich isotherms. These
data clearly indicate that the Langmuir isotherm is more effective
at describing the adsorption behaviors of both Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM.
This confirms that the adsorption mechanism for both Cell-EDTA and
Cell-CM was chemisorption,18,59 meaning that a monolayer
of each adsorbate formed on the surface of the adsorbents.

2.4 Desorption
Studies of Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM
The ability to desorb metal
ions from an adsorbent is an important
factor in determining the lifetime of the adsorbent. Thus, regenerability
of Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM was investigated. In general, various desorbing
or regenerating agents—such as acids (HCl, HNO3,
and H2SO4), bases (NaOH), and chloride salts
(NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2)—can be used for regeneration
of adsorbents. In this study, 1 M HCl was selected to study the regenerability
of these two adsorbents since it has a high desorption efficiency
and is widely used.60 First, each adsorbent
was used to adsorb 100 mg L–1 of Pb2+ or Cd2+ solution at pH 6. Second, each adsorbed adsorbent
was regenerated using 1 M HCl solution. Finally, the adsorbent was
washed with DI water until a neutral pH was reached. These steps were
repeated for five cycles. The regenerability of each adsorbent was
determined using eq 7 7  where i is the
cycle number
of the experiment. The results are plotted in Figure 10 and show that the regenerability values
for Cell-EDTA were in the range of 96–94% for Pb2+ and 98–95% for Cd2+—both of which were
higher than those for Cell-CM, which were in the range of 43–41%
for Cd2+ and 62–44% for Pb2+. The adsorption
efficiencies of Cell-EDTA remained high at 40.5 mg g–1 for Pb2+ and 31.8 mg g–1 for Cd2+ for the fifth cycle (versus 41.2 mg g–1 for Pb2+ and 33.2 mg g–1 for Cd2+ for the first cycle), while the adsorption efficiencies
of Cell-CM dropped significantly to 43.5 mg g–1 of
Pb2+ and 15.6 mg g–1 of Cd2+ by the fifth cycle (starting from 63.4 mg g–1 for
Pb2+ and 23.0 mg g–1 for Cd2+ for the first cycle). This indicated that the desorption efficiency
of each cycle for Cell-EDTA or the regenerability of Cell-EDTA was
significantly better than that of Cell-CM. This is due to the fact
that Cell-EDTA captures each metal ion using covalent bonding, which
is weaker than the ionic bonding used with Cell-CM, and thus the desorption
process between Cell-EDTA and the adsorbates occurs more easily. Another
point that was observed when comparing the regenerabilities of the
two adsorbates using the same adsorbent was that the values of Cd2+ were slightly higher than those of Pb2+. This
could have been because the Pb–adsorbent bond strength was
greater than the Cd–adsorbent bond strength.

Figure 10 Regenerability of Cell-EDTA
and Cell-CM for five cycles: (a) Cd2+ and (b) Pb2+ solutions. Conditions for adsorption:
concentration of Pb2+ or Cd2+ = 100 mg L–1, pH = 6, at room temperature for 30 min. Conditions
for desorption: 50 mL of 1 M HCl, at room temperature for 30 min.

2.5 Adsorption Studies of Cell-EDTA
and Cell-CM
in a Mixture of Pb2+ and Cd2+
Cell-EDTA
and Cell-CM were studied using a binary adsorption system, as shown
in Figures 11 and 12, respectively. These experiments were employed
to understand the adsorption behavior of the adsorbates in the system
and determine the adsorption ability of the adsorbates. The solutions
used for the study were a mixture of Pb2+ and Cd2+ at various total metal ion concentrations of Pb2+/Cd2+ (see Table S1). It was found
that both adsorbents adsorbed Pb2+ more efficiently than
Cd2+. For both adsorbents, this behavior can be explained
with reference to the covalent index,61 given in eq 8 for Cell-EDTA,
and using the effect of ionic bond formation for Cell-CM. 8  where En is the electronegativity
value and r is the atomic radius in nanometers. The
(En, r) values of Pb and Cd are (2.33, 0.180 nm)
and (1.69, 0.158 nm),
respectively. Thus, the covalent indices of Pb2+ and Cd2+ were determined to be 0.977 and 0.451 nm, respectively,
indicating that the ability of Pb2+ to bond with both adsorbents
was greater than that of Cd2+. This study suggests that
in an adsorption system, where various metal ions are present and
one of these two adsorbents is used, the order of the adsorption ability
from the greatest to the lowest in the adsorption system will be the
same as the order of the covalent index value of each metal from the
greatest to the smallest.

Pb2+ adsorbed and (b) Cd2+ adsorbed versus Pb2+ + Cd2+ concentration. Conditions for adsorption:

and (b) Cd2+ adsorbed versus Pb2+ + Cd2+ concentration. Conditions for adsorption: pH = 6, at room temperature
for 90 min.

For Cell-CM, the ability of the
adsorbent for metal ion adsorption
depends on the ability to form ionic bonding between the carboxyl
group and each metal ion. This ability is also governed by the En
value of each metal. The results of the adsorption abilities of Pb2+ and Cd2+ by Cell-CM presented in Figure 12 indicate that the qm value of Pb2+ is much greater than
that of Cd2+, which is in good agreement with their respective
En values. Moreover, the adsorption ability of Pb2+ onto
Cell-CM (Figure 12a) is greater than that of Pb2+ onto Cell-EDTA (Figure 11a). This is probably
because ionic bond formation takes place much more quickly than covalent
bonding. In other words, Cd2+ was able to compete with
Pb2+ for only a relatively short time for adsorption onto
Cell-CM, unlike in the case of Cell-EDTA, where the time to reach
equilibrium was much longer, meaning that Cd2+ ions had
a greater opportunity to compete with Pb2+ ions; hence,
the difference in selectivity between Pb2+ and Cd2+ was smaller for Cell-EDTA than for Cell-CM.

3 Conclusions
Using a soda or alkaline process, α-cellulose
fiber was extracted
from PAL following which it was modified with either EDTA or carboxymethyl
groups to produce Cell-EDTA or Cell-CM, respectively. These two modified
celluloses were successfully prepared and used as adsorbents for adsorption
studies of heavy metal ions (Pb2+ and Cd2+)
in single and binary adsorption systems. It was found that Cell-EDTA
had maximum adsorption for Pb2+ and Cd2+ at
41.2 and 33.2 mg g–1, respectively, while Cell-CM
gave maximum values of 63.4 and 23.0 mg g–1. All
of these values were much greater than those of the unmodified cellulose.
Comparing the adsorption values (found in this work) with other adsorbents
reported in the literature (see Table S1), it can be seen that both of the modified celluloses are excellent
adsorbents that are efficient for the removal of Pb2+ and
Cd2+. However, these two adsorbents possess lower adsorption
efficiencies when compared to some other adsorbents that have the
same functional group, potentially due to the differences in the number
of active sites per weight of the adsorbents. In the study of adsorption
time, it was found that for both Pb2+ and Cd2+ solutions the time required to reach adsorption equilibrium was
much longer for Cell-EDTA than for Cell-CM. This is due to the facts
that the adsorption process occurs via covalent coordinate bonding
for Cell-EDTA and that this is naturally slower than the ionic bonding
associated with Cell-CM. However, compared to Cell-CM, Cell-EDTA was
much more effective in terms of regenerability using 1 M of HCl solution.
In the kinetic model study, a pseudo-first-order model described well
the adsorption behaviors of Pb2+ and Cd2+ onto
Cell-CM. By contrast, a pseudo-second-order model fitted better the
adsorption behaviors of Pb2+ and Cd2+ onto Cell-EDTA.
Additionally, the adsorption behavior for each adsorbate onto each
adsorbent was well described using the Langmuir isotherm, since the
adsorption behaviors of both adsorbents involved monolayer chemisorption.
In the study of a binary adsorption system, the amounts of Pb2+ adsorbed onto both Cell-EDTA and Cell-CM were greater than
those of Cd2+, and Cell-CM was more selective as regards
Pb2+ adsorption than Cell-EDTA. This study showed that
cellulose fiber can be extracted from pineapple leaves and can be
modified into heavy metal ion adsorbents.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Determination of PAL Composition
The composition of the extracted cellulose fiber—ethanol–benzene
extractives, ethanol extractives, hot water extractives, holo-cellulose,
hemi-cellulose, α-cellulose, lignin, and ash—were analyzed
using the TAPPI standard test methods (see the Supporting Information for details).

4.2 Extraction
of Cellulose from PAL
The leaves of pineapple (Smooth Cayenne)
were collected from a pineapple
farm in Bangsaphan, Prachuap Khiri Khan province, Thailand. After
being dried overnight in an air oven at 70 °C, the dried PALs
were blended using a mechanical blending machine. PAL fiber was then
extracted from the blended sample (50 g) using 500 mL of 10% sodium
hydroxide (NaOH, 98%, Carlo Erbra) at 100 °C for 1 h. The extracted
fiber was filtered and rinsed using tap water until the pH was neutral.
The obtained fiber was then bleached using 6 g of sodium chlorite
(NaClO2, 80%, Ajax FineChem), 2 mL of glacial acetic acid
(CH3COOH, 98.0%, QReC), and 640 mL of DI water at 60 °C
for 30 min. After that, it was filtered and rinsed using tap water
until the pH was neutral before being dried overnight at 70 °C
in an air oven to produce the final extracted cellulose fiber.

4.3 Modifications of Extracted Cellulose Fiber
The extracted
cellulose fiber normally has a low adsorption efficiency
due to its hydroxyl group status. The hydroxyl group can be modified
into another functional group that has a higher adsorption efficiency.
In this study, EDTA and carboxymethyl groups were investigated as
follows.

4.3.1 EDTA Group
The extracted cellulose
was modified using EDTA (denoted as Cell-EDTA) as follows.18 The extracted cellulose (1 g) was pretreated
with 50 mL of 10% NaOH solution for 24 h. Then, the pretreated cellulose
was immersed in 100 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (C2H6OS, 99.5%, Riedel-de Haen) at 60 °C and treated with 3 g of
EDTA dianhydride (C10H12N2O6, Sigma-Aldrich), followed by 5 mL of pyridine (C5H5N, 99+%, Alfa Aezar), all while being stirred under N2 gas. After continuous stirring at 60 °C for 20 h, the
modified cellulose was filtered and washed with 100 mL of DI water,
100 mL of ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.9%, QReC), and
100 mL of acetone (C3H6O, 99.5%, QReC), respectively.
After that, the sample was dried overnight at 65 °C in an air
oven to produce the final product (Cell-EDTA).

4.3.2 Carboxymethyl Group
Carboxymethyl
cellulose (denoted as Cell-CM) was prepared as follows. The extracted
cellulose (3.0 g) was treated with a solution of NaOH (10%, w/v) mixed
with isopropyl alcohol (99.7%, Qrec) using a ratio of extracted cellulose/10%
NaOH solution/isopropyl alcohol of 1:4:20 (w/v/v). The mixture was
stirred using a hotplate stirrer (Scilogex MS7-H550-S) for 1 h at
room temperature. After that, 3.6 g of sodium monochlorite (Ajax FineChem)
was added into the mixture, and then the temperature was increased
to 55 °C and left for 3 h. Next, the solution was neutralized
using 90% acetic acid (98.0%, QReC), followed by filtering and washing
with an ethanol solution (70% v/v). Finally, the modified cellulose
was kept in an open container for drying overnight at room temperature
before using it as an adsorbent.

4.4 Characterization
of Extracted Cellulose and
Modified Celluloses
The physical, morphological, and chemical
compositions of the samples before and after modification were observed
using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDS, model: JEOL JSM7600F). The samples were
coated with platinum before imaging.

Functional groups of the
samples were examined using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer
(model: Bruker Optics, α-E), using the attenuated total reflection
(ATR) mode.

4.5 Adsorption Studies
Different concentrations
of Pb2+ (Pb(NO3)2, 99.5%, Qrec) and
Cd2+ (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 98%, HiMedia) in DI water were prepared and used to investigate
the adsorption efficiency of the modified celluloses in the pH range
of 1–7. The adsorption kinetics models were determined using
each sample (1.0 g) to adsorb 100 mg L–1 of lead
or cadmium ions for different times (1, 3, 5, 9, 12, 15, 20, 50, 90,
120, and 150 min). An adsorption kinetics model was formulated using
the information from the experimental data. In addition, the adsorption
isotherms were investigated using each sample (1.0 g) to adsorb lead
or cadmium ions at different concentrations in the range of 30–160
mg L–1. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of
modified cellulose in a binary system of adsorption was investigated
using various lead-to-cadmium ratios and various total concentrations
of lead and cadmium ion solutions (more details can be found in Table S2). An atomic absorption spectrometer
(AAS, PerkinElmer, HGA-800) was used to analyze the residual metal
ion concentration after adsorption. Finally, experiments for studying
the recyclability of the samples were carried out using a solution
of 1 M HCl to observe the regenerative ability of each sample.
