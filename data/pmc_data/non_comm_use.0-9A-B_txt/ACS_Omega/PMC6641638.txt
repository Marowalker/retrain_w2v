In
this study, the anion-binding bis(cyclopeptide) 2 is
introduced, which dissolves freely in water, affording up to
10 mM concentrations, thanks to triethylene glycol-derived substituents
in the cyclopeptide subunits and the linker connecting them. Binding
studies provided evidence that the anion affinity previously demonstrated
for less-soluble analogs of this compound is retained under highly
competitive aqueous conditions. The highest affinity in water was
observed for iodide, closely followed by sulfate anions, whereas binding
of soft and weakly coordinating anions could not be observed. The
anion selectivity of 2 thus differs from that of other
recently described receptors, which also do not require electrostatic
or coordinative interactions for anion binding in water but typically
fail to bind strongly coordinating sulfate anions. The ability of 2 to overcome sulfate hydration is attributed to the special
mode of binding, combining direct N–H···A– interactions with the release of water molecules from
the receptor cavity. The characterization of the anion binding of 2 and a related bis(cyclopeptide) in a variety of different
solvents and aqueous solvent mixtures furthermore allowed the correlation
of the binding properties with solvent parameters. These analyses
provided qualitative and even quantitative insights into the solvent
properties and solvation phenomena that mainly affect anion complexation.

==== Body
Introduction
Solute–solute
interactions are profoundly affected by the
surrounding medium.1 As a consequence,
the affinity of two binding partners in solution does not only reflect
their intrinsic structural complementarity but also the effects of
the solvent on the efficacy of the interactions.

In host–guest
chemistry, the choice of the solvent for binding
studies is typically governed by the solubilities of the receptor
and the substrate. In addition, the solvent is chosen such that effects
complicating the quantification of affinity, such as a too high or
too low complex stability or unspecific aggregation, are avoided.
Only in rare cases can the solvent be regarded as an unstructured
medium, whose influence on the binding strength solely depends on
the relative permittivity, however. Most solvent molecules are more
or less acidic or basic, and their interactions with hydrogen-bond
donors or acceptors of the binding partners therefore compete with
the actual binding event. In other words, the energy required to desolvate
parts of the receptor and the substrate reduces the complex stability.
The situation becomes particularly complicated in solvent mixtures
in which complex formation is influenced by the effects of different
solvent molecules and by the interactions of the solvent molecules
with themselves.2

If the solvent
is highly structured, as in the case of water, additional
phenomena come into play. The most prominent one is the hydrophobic
effect, which is usually associated with the entropic gain resulting
from the release of water molecules from the solvation shells of the
binding partners when they come together.3 Moreover, complex formation in water can also have a strong enthalpic
driving force if high-energy water molecules are released from the
receptor cavity upon guest entry (nonclassical hydrophobic effect).1,3d This effect has partly been made responsible for the extremely high
affinity of cucurbiturils for organic guests.4 It is most pronounced for cucurbit[7]uril, where a particularly
large number of hydrogen bonds are gained when releasing the cavity-bound
water upon complex formation.5 Other host–guest
complexes, such as those between γ-cyclodextrin and anions like
dodecaborate clusters, feature a highly exothermic binding enthalpy
that is accompanied by a pronounced loss of entropy.6 This thermodynamic signature of complex formation was rationalized
by the chaotropic nature of the anions, whose solvation shell features
a reduced number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule. The complexation
of the dodecaborate anions thus leads to the structuring of water
with a concomitant strengthening of hydrogen bonds.

Water is
therefore not necessarily a challenging medium that requires
strong interactions for effective host–guest interactions.
If complex formation is accompanied by enthalpically and/or entropically
favorable changes of the water structure, overall high complex stabilities
can be achieved. Importantly, also inorganic anions, which are generally
considered rather difficult substrates in water,7 can be bound with appropriate receptors even if the underlying
binding modes are much weaker than the Coulombic or coordinative interactions
typically employed for anion recognition.8 Examples are the above-mentioned dodecaborate clusters, which strongly
bind to γ-cyclodextrin.6 Iodide anions
have been shown to form complexes with α-cyclodextrin,9 whereas perchlorate binding was demonstrated
for not only α-cyclodextrin10 but
also a water-soluble octaanionic deep-cavity cavitand.11 The currently most efficient anion receptors
in water that do not employ Coulombic or coordinative interactions
are Sindelar’s bambusurils12 and
the structurally somewhat related biotinurils developed in the Pittelkow
group.13 The affinity of bambus[6]uril
for iodide and perchlorate anions, for example, exceeds a log Ka of 6 in aqueous phosphate buffer,12a whereas the affinity of biotin[6]uril is highest
for thiocyanate under comparable conditions, amounting to a log Ka of 4.5.13b

Impressive anion affinities in water have thus been achieved with
synthetic receptors. It is also evident, however, that the respective
receptors preferentially bind soft and weakly coordinating anions.
Anions that are classified as kosmotropes14 are bound only weakly (chloride), and the most strongly coordinating
oxoanions, such as sulfate anions, are not bound at all. The reason
could be that the relatively hydrophobic cavities of these receptors
are unsuitable to host polar anions or do not feature appropriate
binding sites to interact with them. In addition, the thermodynamics
of complex formation (high negative binding enthalpy and unfavorable
entropy) suggests that the intrinsic selectivity of these receptors
for chaotropic anions could be mediated to some extent by solvent
effects analogously as in the dodecaborate/γ-cyclodextrin complexes.
In the case of the cavitand developed by Gibbs, the negative binding
entropy has also been associated with the incorporation of partially
hydrated anions into the receptor cavity.15

The binding of strongly coordinating and therefore strongly
hydrated
anions in water by means of noncovalent interactions obviously requires
different receptor architectures and possibly other types of interactions.
Indeed, existing sulfate receptors active in aqueous media combine
directed hydrogen-bond donors, which often completely surround the
anion, and Coulomb attraction.7,16 Examples are the polyammonium
cages described by Delgado and Mateus,17 the coordination cages developed by Custelcean and Hay, which feature
12 urea NH groups converging toward the cavity,18 You’s tetrakis(imidazolium)-derived receptor, which
forms a sandwich-type 2:1 complex with sulfate anions, in which the
anion is bound by eight C–H···O hydrogen bonds,19 and the pyrrole-based triazoliumphane described
by Hay and Sessler.20 Strong Coulombic
interactions are, however, not necessarily required to complex sulfate
or other anions in aqueous media, as demonstrated by the bis(cyclopeptides)
developed in our group.21a,21b These bis(cyclopeptides),
an example being compound 1 (Chart 1), feature two covalently linked cyclic hexapeptide
units composed of alternating l-proline and 6-aminopicolinic
acid subunits. Their interactions with anions involve the incorporation
of the anion into the cavity between the two cyclopeptide rings, where
it interacts with six NH groups from the two receptor subunits. To
illustrate this arrangement, the calculated structure of the sulfate
complex of a derivative of 1 lacking the substituents
on the aromatic rings is shown in Figure 1. The 2,2′-(1,3-phenylene)diacetic
acid-derived linker in this bis(cyclopeptide) induces an arrangement
of the two cyclopeptide rings that allows their simultaneous interaction
with the anion. The sulfate anion is bound by hydrogen-bonding interactions
to the peptide NH groups of the two cyclopeptide rings. In the crystal
structure of the sulfate complex of a structurally related bis(cyclopeptide),21c nine hydrogen bonds were found between the
receptor and the anion, with an overall similar arrangement of the
cyclopeptide rings, for example. Such 1:1 complexes are entropically
favored at millimolar concentrations of the binding partners over
complexes in which anions link several bis(cyclopeptide) moieties,
consistent with mass spectrometric results.21a−21c

B3LYP functional and the 6-31G* basis set as implemented in the Gaussian
09 program package. Nonacidic hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

Chart 1 Bis(cyclopeptides) 1 and 2
We previously demonstrated
that even a simple cyclic hexapeptide
containing hydroxyproline and 6-aminopicolinic acid units forms a
weakly stable 1:1 complex with sulfate in water.21d The three well-preorganized NH groups flanked by the five-membered
rings of the hydroxyproline units of this cyclopeptide therefore seem
to produce a suitable environment for sulfate complexation even in
highly competitive media. Cyclopeptides with proline rings typically
prefer the formation of 2:1 complexes in aqueous solvents, structurally
closely related to the one shown in Figure 1.21d The underlying
2:1 equilibria are, however, difficult to analyze, which is why we
mostly concentrate on the characterization of the binding properties
of bis(cyclopeptides) that form 1:1 complexes.21a−21c Unfortunately, the derivatives investigated so far turned out to
be not sufficiently soluble to allow binding studies in water. The
compound with the so far highest water solubility is bis(cyclopeptide) 1 (Chart 1),
containing solubilizing groups on the six aminopicolinic acid units.
This bis(cyclopeptide) binds sulfate anions in 95 vol % water/methanol
with a log Ka of 3.7.21e

Here, we show that bis(cyclopeptide) 2 containing
an additional solubilizing triethylene glycol unit in the aromatic
linker possesses a significantly higher water solubility. Binding
studies provided evidence that anions are still bound under these
conditions with a selectivity that is distinctly different from that
of, for example, bambusuril. The notable sulfate affinity of 2 highlights, in particular, the complementary behavior of 2 with respect to other recently described anion receptors.
The characterization of the anion affinity of 1 and 2 in different solvents furthermore revealed a correlation
between the thermodynamics of the complex formation and the solvent
properties, thus providing a deep insight into the solvent parameters
that govern the anion affinity.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Qualitative Binding Studies
Bis(cyclopeptide) 2 was synthesized from the known cyclopeptide monoamine 3(21e) and the active ester 5 (Scheme 1). The latter
was obtained in a two-step sequence by first converting
the commercial 2,2′,2″-(benzene-1,3,5-triyl)triacetic
acid into the respective tris(pentafluorophenol) ester 4, followed by amidation of one ester group upon treatment with 1
equiv of 2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethanamine. Receptor 2 turned out to be soluble in water at concentrations up to 10 mM,
clearly demonstrating the positive effect of the linker side chains
on water solubility.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 2
Qualitative 1H NMR spectroscopic
binding studies were
initially performed to evaluate the mode of anion binding of 2. These measurements revealed pronounced shifts of bis(cyclopeptide)
signals in the 1H NMR spectrum upon the addition of sodium
iodide or sulfate to a solution of 2 in D2O, all of which are characteristic of anion complexation (Figure S9).21a,21e Specifically,
the signals corresponding to the proline H(α) protons of 2 shift downfield by ca. 1 ppm, whereas those of aromatic
bis(cyclopeptide) protons shift upfield. Both effects are consistent
with the incorporation of an anion in the space between the two receptor
subunits, demonstrating that the known mode of anion binding of these
bis(cyclopeptides) is not affected by the additional side chain in 2. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) of solutions
of 2 containing Na2SO4 or NaI also
demonstrated the presence of the corresponding anion complexes in
solution, furthermore showing that 1:1 complexes are preferentially
formed (Figures S10 and S11).

Anion Affinity
in Water
The affinity of 2 in water for a series
of anions was quantified by isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC), a method that provides a full picture of binding
energetics in a single titration.22 The
quantification of binding strength in water turned out to be possible
for the halides chloride, bromide, and iodide, and for sulfate. All
other anions investigated, namely, selenate, nitrate, dihydrogen phosphate,
and perchlorate, did not produce measureable heat changes when added
to an aqueous solution of 2, indicating that either these
anions are not bound or that the complex formation is enthalpically
neutral. The obtained results are summarized in Table 1.

Titrations yielding
anion affinities log Ka > 3
were evaluated using the one-site binding model,
which involves fitting the binding isotherms simultaneously to Ka (or ΔG), ΔH, and the stoichiometry factor, n. This
treatment proved to afford significantly better fits than if only Ka and ΔH were treated
as unknowns. The reason is that the fitted n corrects
for deviations in the assumed cell concentrations, thus improving
the overall consistency of the data when comparing a large number
of experiments (i.e., Ka and ΔH of related experiments end up to be similar even if the
respective n values vary). The average of the n values obtained in all our measurements (Tables 1 and S3–S8) amounts to 0.94 ± 0.15, supporting the assumption that 1 and 2 prefer to form 1:1 complexes and confirming
the result of ESIMS. Fitting the binding isotherms using the one-site
binding model became unreliable only for weakly stable complexes,
such as the one with chloride. In this case, n was
fixed to 1.00, and the thermodynamic parameters obtained for this
complex are therefore associated with a larger error.

Table 1 shows that 2 possesses appreciable affinity for certain anions in water.
Halide affinity decreases in the order iodide > bromide > chloride,
a trend that reflects the changes of binding enthalpy in this sequence,
being favorable for iodide binding but becoming progressively unfavorable
when going to chloride. The concomitant increase of binding entropy
cannot fully compensate for the enthalpy loss, so that the chloride
complex of 2 ends up to be more than 1 order of magnitude
less stable in water than the iodide complex. Sulfate binding is endothermic
as well, but a large entropic term renders the corresponding complex
overall only slightly less stable than the iodide complex. The anion
selectivity of 2 thus mirrors the one of bis(cyclopeptide) 1, which was shown to become more selective for the weakly
coordinating iodide anion once the water content of the solvent increases
beyond 90 vol %.21e The experimentally
determined iodide affinity of 2 in water turned out to
be slightly lower than the one previously predicted on the basis of
an extrapolation analysis,21e showing that
the removal of the last 5 vol % of the organic component in the solvent
mixture causes a more-than-expected drop of affinity.

The trends
in the binding enthalpy evident in Table 1 can reasonably be attributed
to the combined effects of anion desolvation and direct receptor interactions.
In the case of the halides, the coordination strength of the anions
increases in the order iodide < bromide < chloride, rendering
chloride anions typically the strongest bound substrates in this series.
In water, however, solvation effects counteract this intrinsic selectivity,
as the most strongly coordinating anion is also the one that is most
difficult to desolvate. Moreover, factors such as anion size additionally
influence the anion affinity. Our previous investigations provided
evidence, for example, that the binding site of a bis(cyclopeptide)
related to 2 is best suited to host larger anions, such
as iodide, whereas chloride is too small to simultaneously interact
with all six peptide NH groups.21a,21b Costlier
anion desolvation and an increasing mismatch between anion and cavity
size therefore likely account for the increasingly unfavorable enthalpy
of halide binding from iodide to chloride. In the case of the strongly
coordinating sulfate anion, anion desolvation is even more difficult
than chloride desolvation. Interactions with 2 can be
expected to be stronger, however, because of the size of the sulfate
anion and its twofold negative charge, rationalizing why the overall
enthalpy of sulfate binding is slightly less endothermic than that
of chloride binding.

The absence of heat effects in the titrations
with selenate, nitrate,
dihydrogen phosphate, or perchlorate does not exclude that these anions
interact with 2. It could well be that the enthalpic
contributions of the anion desolvation and the receptor–anion
interaction coincidentally cancel out, leaving binding only due to
entropy. We assume that this is indeed the case with selenate, an
anion closely related in size and charge to sulfate but slightly easier
to desolvate.23 To test this assumption,
selenate binding was also studied in 70 vol % water/methanol. In this
solvent, a measurable exothermic heat of complex formation could be
detected, with the ITC titration yielding a stability log Ka for the corresponding complex of 3.46 (ΔH = −5.1 kJ mol–1, TΔS = 14.6 kJ mol–1, n = 1.07). Thus, selenate is bound by 2, albeit
approximately 1 order of magnitude weaker than sulfate under the same
conditions (vide infra), which could explain the lack of heat effects
when titrating 2 with selenate in water.

Phosphate
anions, which are singly or doubly protonated in water
at neutral pH, could, on the other hand, be indeed unable to interact
with 2 because repulsive interactions between the hydrogen-bond
donors within the receptor cavity and those of the anions should destabilize
the complex. The same effect is responsible for the low affinity of
the sulfate-binding protein for phosphate.24 We therefore quantified sulfate binding also in phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4). This measurement showed that the presence of the buffer
has almost no effect on the thermodynamics of binding (Table 1). Thus, phosphate anions do
not interfere in sulfate complexation even when present in excess,
suggesting that they do not bind to the receptor. In other words,
bis(cyclopeptide) 2 recognizes sulfate selectively over
other tetrahedral albeit protonated anions in water, rendering this
receptor a good model for the sulfate-binding protein.

The weakly
coordinating nature of nitrate and perchlorate renders
it unlikely that the anions bind with a notable affinity to 2 in water. Nitrate affinity of a related bis(cyclopeptide)
was determined by NMR titration to amount to only 130 M–1 in 50 vol% D2O/methanol-d4, for example.21a Although we cannot fully
exclude that weakly stable complexes are formed with these anions,
it is important to note that the strong exothermicity observed for
the binding of perchlorate anions to bambusuril is not observed in
the case of 2.12a

Selectivity
of 2 thus substantially differs from that
of other previously described anion receptors that do not use strong
electrostatic or coordinative interactions for anion binding. Beer’s
anion-binding rotaxane, for example, binds iodide with almost the
same affinity as 2 but sulfate with a significantly lower
affinity.25 Noteworthy is also the profoundly
different anion selectivity of 2 compared to that of
glycoluril-derived anion receptors.12,13 Whereas the
halide affinity of biotinuril and 2 is similar, biotinuril
also binds perchlorate and, in particular, thiocyanate anions.13b Bambusuril and 2 bind chloride
with similar affinity, but the affinity of bambusuril to bromide and
iodide anions is much higher than that of 2. Notable
is the large affinity of bambusuril for perchlorate that reaches a
log Ka in water of 7.7.12a

These differences in the binding properties
of glycoluril-based
receptors and our bis(cyclopeptides) presumably relate to the different
natures of their binding sites. Whereas 2 features a
cavity containing NH groups that can engage in directed interactions
with included anions, these groups are absent in the cavities of bambusuril
and biotinuril. Anion binding of the latter two compounds is mainly
governed by multiple C–H···A– interactions, whose soft nature could explain the preference for
weakly coordinating ions. Besides the actual binding sites, solvation
effects could also be responsible for the different binding properties
of our bis(cyclopeptides) and glycoluril-based receptors. An insight
into these effects was gained by investigating the solvent dependence
of the complex formation.

Anion Affinity in Organic Solvents
The good solubility
of bis(cyclopeptides) 1 and 2 in various
solvents allowed us to evaluate the extent to which their anion affinity
is influenced by the medium. We concentrated on polar competitive
solvents, namely, water, methanol, acetonitrile, and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), which are frequently used in anion-binding studies.8 All measurements could be performed using the
synthetically more easily accessible 1 because it turned
out that sufficiently high bis(cyclopeptide) concentrations for the
ITC titrations (0.25 mM) could be achieved in water if 1 was isolated after chromatographic purification by freeze-drying.
Measurements in selected solvents were also performed using 2, which revealed only minor differences in the thermodynamics
of the anion binding of 1 and 2 (Tables S3–S8). Binding studies were restricted
to iodide because of the low solubility of sulfate salts in the organic
solvents. Because of the better solubility, tetramethylammonium iodide
had to be used as the salt in the organic solvents. Reference measurements
indicated that the cation has only a minor influence on the thermodynamics
of anion binding (vide infra), rendering a comparison of the results
with the ones obtained for 1 and sodium iodide in water
feasible. The thermodynamic parameters obtained in these studies are
summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 demonstrates
the expected increase in the strength of iodide binding when going
from water to methanol or acetonitrile. In both of these solvents,
iodide binding is enthalpically significantly more favorable than
that in water. Conversely, entropy becomes less favorable, which is
the hallmark of enthalpy/entropy compensation. Because of the unfavorable
binding entropy in acetonitrile, the overall stability of the iodide
complex in this solvent is slightly lower than that in methanol. Surprisingly,
the least-stable complex is formed in DMSO (and not in water) mainly
as a result of the endothermicity of complex formation in this solvent.

Rationalizing the solvent dependence of iodide binding is not straightforward
because the overall process of complex formation comprises several
steps, whose individual thermodynamic signatures cannot be experimentally
determined by ITC. An insight can be gained by correlating the possible
contributions of individual steps with parameters describing characteristic
solvent properties, a selection of which is presented in Table 3.

The strength of the direct interactions
between the anion and the
binding sites on the receptors could relate to the dipole moment,
μ, of the solvent, for example, or Dimroth’s and Reichardt’s ET(30)26a,26b or Kosower’s Z values,26c which are alternative
measures of solvent polarity. Potential contributions from hydrophobic
and/or dispersive interactions between the two bis(cyclopeptide) subunits
in their anion complexes21c could also
be related to these parameters. Information about solvation effects
may alternatively be derived from the descriptors that characterize
the hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor strengths of the solvents, for
example, the Kamlet–Taft parameters, π*, describing polarity/polarizability;
α, describing the hydrogen-bond donation ability; and β,
describing the hydrogen-bond acceptance ability.26d In addition, energies of transfer of the anion from water
to an organic solvent could be correlated with anion solvation in
the respective medium.26e

Besides
direct host–guest interactions and solvent reorganization
during complex formation, also the extent of ion pairing in the different
solvents could affect the complex stability. This effect should be
small, however, on account of the relatively small effects associated
with changing the counterion in the titrations from tetramethyl- to
tetrabutylammonium ions (Tables S3–S8). Experimental evidence that tetramethylammonium iodide is practically
not ion-paired in DMSO or methanol and only weakly in acetonitrile
has recently been published.27 Difficult
to estimate are the effects of the solvent on the conformation of
the receptors before complex formation and, hence, the energetic contributions
associated with the conformational reorganization of the receptor
from the initial to the complexed state.

Focusing first on the
solvent dependence of iodide solvation, one
would intuitively expect that desolvating iodide is easier in the
organic solvents than in water. Indeed, transferring iodide from water
to any of the investigated organic solvents is associated with positive
Gibbs free energies of transfer ΔGtr. A more facile anion desolvation could thus explain the higher stability
of the iodide complex of 1 in acetonitrile and methanol
with respect to water. If iodide desolvation is the only factor governing
complex stability, the complex stability in DMSO should also be high,
however, which is not the case. This result suggests that one or more
competing factors exist that cause complex stability to be unexpectedly
low in this solvent.

To decide which additional parameter(s)
could explain the observed
trends, we tried to establish a correlation by multiparametric analysis
in the form ΔG = gΔGtr + aA + ···
that quantitatively describes the dependence of the experimental free
binding energies ΔG on ΔGtr in combination with one or more of the solvent parameters
in Table 3 or related
ones available in the literature.28 The
only tested parameter that afforded a statistically reasonably relevant
relationship (R2 = 0.9882) was α,
which describes the hydrogen-bond donation ability of the medium.
Combining α with further parameters did not significantly improve
the fit. The equation resulting from the analysis, namely, ΔG = −1.52ΔGtr –
21.61α, is consistent with the expected dependence of ΔG on ΔGtr: large positive
ΔGtr values that signify an easier
anion desolvation with respect to water cause the complex stability
to increase. The additional dependence of ΔG on α somewhat counterintuitively suggests that solvents, which
are good hydrogen-bond donors (higher α), also have a beneficial
effect on the complex stability. It is important to note that this
correlation extends to the solvent dependence of iodide and sulfate
complexation in water/acetonitrile and water/methanol mixtures (vide
infra).

We associate the dependence of ΔG on α
to the solvent reorganization at the binding site of 1 during complex formation. In water, the concave binding sites of
each cyclopeptide moiety of 1 can be expected to be solvated
by water molecules before the complex formation. The arrangement of
these water molecules could resemble the one found in the crystal
structure of the trihydrate of the parent cyclopeptide 6 (Figure 2).29 Each of the three water molecules in this crystal
structure binds to an NH group of the peptide with its oxygen atom
and further engages with one proton in a hydrogen bond to the oxygen
atom of the neighboring water molecule. No hydrogen bonds are formed
to the ring nitrogen atoms of 6. Thus, a cyclic array
of three water molecules results, in which three protons, oriented
close to the alkyl chains of the proline rings, remain vacant. In
solution, the inability of water molecules to saturate their hydrogen-bonding
interactions in the cavity between the cyclopeptide rings of 1 possibly extends to other water molecules surrounding the
apolar regions of the proline rings remote from the actual binding
site. Hydration of the cyclopeptide thus likely creates a cluster
of water molecules within the receptor cavity, of which some cannot
satisfy their donor sites. The release of these water molecules upon
complex formation thus allows vacant hydrogen-bond donors to find
binding partners again, resulting in an entropic and presumably enthalpic
gain.

of the trihydrate of 6 shown as a space-filling model
(left) and in a schematic fashion (right).29

The dependence of ΔG on α could thus
be associated with the extent to which the hydrophobic effect contributes
to the stability of the iodide complex of 1 in the different
solvents: the energetic situation created by receptor hydration is
particularly unfavorable in water, as hydrogen-bond donors remain
vacant on water molecules that tend to engage in interactions with
other water molecules. Receptor desolvation is therefore thermodynamically
beneficial. In solvents with smaller α values than water, vacant
hydrogen-bond donor sites created during the receptor solvation pose
less of a thermodynamic disadvantage until this disadvantage fully
disappears in DMSO, whose α is zero. Favorable thermodynamic
contributions of solvent reorganization during iodide complexation
by 1 thus become smaller in the order water > methanol
≫ acetonitrile > DMSO. Conversely, DMSO is the strongest
hydrogen-bond
acceptor of the four solvents studied (β = 0.76). DMSO molecules
should therefore engage in pronounced interactions with the NH groups
of 1, rendering receptor desolvation difficult. Considering
that iodide desolvation is also enthalpically more difficult in DMSO
than in water (Table 3), an effect usually explained by soft–soft interactions,26h,30 the low iodide affinity of 1 (and the endothermicity
of complex formation) in DMSO could be rationalized by the enthalpically
unfavorable receptor and anion desolvation combined with the lack
of hydrophobic effects.

On the basis of the above considerations,
the thermodynamics of
iodide binding in acetonitrile and methanol can also be understood.
Both solvents are less polar (lower π*) than water or DMSO,
and the direct anion–receptor interactions should therefore
be intrinsically stronger. The desolvation of iodide anions in acetonitrile
is costly in enthalpy similarly to that in DMSO. However, receptor
desolvation should be significantly more facile because acetonitrile
is the weakest hydrogen-bond acceptor (lowest β) among the solvents
studied. Strong interactions of iodide with 1 combined
with a facile receptor desolvation and the absence of pronounced hydrophobic
effects could therefore account for the high negative binding enthalpy
and unfavorable binding entropy associated with iodide binding in
acetonitrile. The enthalpic disadvantage of iodide desolvation in
methanol is smaller than that in acetonitrile, but the receptor should
be more strongly solvated (larger β). These opposing effects
in combination with a certain extent of hydrophobic effects upon complex
formation are probably responsible for the similar iodide affinities
of 1 in methanol and acetonitrile.

Anion Affinity
in Solvent Mixtures
Information about
the influence of the gradual change of solvent composition on the
complex formation was obtained by quantifying the anion affinity of 1 in different solvent mixtures. We previously investigated
the iodide and sulfate affinity of 1 in water/methanol
with the water content ranging from 95 to 20 vol %.21e This range of solvent composition has now been extended
from 100% water to 100% methanol. In addition, we also followed anion
binding in water/acetonitrile and water/DMSO. The anions were mostly
used as their sodium salts, and we only had to resort to other salts
in solvents with a high organic content due to solubility reasons.

In the case of sodium iodide, anion affinity could be evaluated
down to 10 vol % of water in water/methanol and 20 vol % of water
in water/acetonitrile. For the measurements in mixtures with respective
lower water contents and in pure organic solvents, tetramethylammonium
iodide was used. The comparison of iodide binding in the solvent mixtures
at which the transition from the sodium to the tetramethylammonium
ion was made indicated that the cation has no marked influence on
the thermodynamics of binding. This counterion effect on anion binding
was also checked in pure organic solvents using tetramethylammonium
and tetrabutylammonium iodide as guest salts. A pronounced effect
of the cation on anion affinity could be detected in none of these
measurements, rendering the influence of ion pairing on anion binding
unlikely. Iodide binding turned out to be almost athermic in water/DMSO
mixtures, thus allowing a reliable determination of complex stability
only in the mixture with 70 vol % water and in DMSO.

Sodium
sulfate was insufficiently soluble for the measurements
if the solvent mixtures contained less than 30% of water. Because
also the use of tetramethylammonium sulfate does not significantly
extend the accessible solvent range, we restricted the evaluation
of sulfate affinity to solvents containing between 100 and 30 vol
% of water in methanol or acetonitrile. The water content could be
decreased to only 40 vol % with DMSO as the cosolvent.

The results
of the measurements are summarized in Tables S3–S8 and Figure 3, showing
the observed trends of sulfate and iodide
affinity in a graphical fashion. The water contents of the solvent
mixtures in the respective graphs are specified in mole percent to
facilitate comparison of the observed trends with solvent parameters,
which are usually reported on the same scale.

Figure 3 Dependence of the Gibbs
free energies of formation of the sulfate
(a) and iodide (b) complexes of bis(cyclopeptides) 1 on
solvent composition (water/methanol, black; water/acetonitrile, red;
water/DMSO, blue).

Figure 3a shows
that sulfate affinity of 1 steeply increases with decreasing
water content of the solvent. The most pronounced effect is observed
with DMSO as a cosolvent, presumably because water/DMSO is a particularly
unfavorable environment for doubly charged anions as reflected in
the substantial Gibbs free energies required for transferring sulfate
anions from water to water/DMSO (Figure S13a).31 Desolvating the sulfate anions in
water/DMSO therefore becomes progressively easier as the DMSO content
rises, an effect that causes the overall ΔG of binding to become more negative in the same direction. The solvent
dependence of the Gibbs free energies of transferring sulfate anions
from water to methanol is less pronounced (Figure S13a),26i which could explain why
increasing the methanol content improves complex stability to a smaller
extent than increasing the DMSO content. Transfer energies for sulfate
anions to water/acetonitrile mixtures are, unfortunately, not available.

The affinity of 1 for the weakly coordinating iodide
anion is mediated by solvent composition in a much subtler fashion
than sulfate affinity. Figure 3b shows that a small amount of methanol or acetonitrile causes
an initial noticeable improvement of affinity, which subsequently
only gradually increases between 10 and ca. 60 mol % of the organic
component. Only further decreasing the water content causes a more
pronounced rise in complex stability. Thus, the almost linear dependence
of iodide affinity on solvent composition we observed in our previous
study in water/methanol between 5 vol % (2.3 mol %) and 80 vol % (64
mol %)21e does not extend into the regions
with a higher or lower content of the organic solvent. The observed
trends of complex stability in water/methanol and water/acetonitrile
cannot be explained by only considering anion desolvation because
iodide transfer energies gradually increase with decreasing water
content in both solvent mixtures without exhibiting a steeper increase
in the high-water-content region or the plateau in the midway region
(Figure S13b). The plateau region, in particular,
again suggests the existence of a compensating factor that counteracts
the positive effect of anion desolvation on complex stability.

The shape of the curve describing the hydrogen-bond donation ability
of water/acetonitrile mixtures, which resembles the red curve in Figure 3b and was associated
with microheterogeneity in different regions of the mixtures (Figure S14),32 indicates
that α could be responsible in this case, too. We therefore
performed multiparametric analyses to assess whether the above-derived
correlation also holds for the solvent mixtures. To this end, the
red curve in Figure 3b was first fitted to a fourth degree polynomial (Figure S15). Subsequently, ΔG values
were calculated at the mole percent solvent compositions, for which
ΔGtr and α for water/acetonitrile
mixtures are available. These values were then used for the fitting
analysis. The same procedure was used to correlate the solvent dependence
of iodide affinity of 1 in water/methanol and that of
sulfate affinity in the solvent mixtures for which ΔGtr values are available. Table 4 summarizes coefficients g and a obtained after fitting. The goodness of the
correlations is depicted graphically in Figure 4.

iodide affinity to ΔGtr and α

Table 4 illustrates
that every analysis afforded characteristic combinations of the coefficients a and g. Considering that the analyses
were performed for a wide range of solvent compositions and different
anions, the respective coefficients are surprisingly similar, with g ranging between −0.62 and −1.75 (average
−1.26 ± 0.44) and a between −17.05
and −23.07 (average −19.94 ± 2.45). Interestingly,
using the averages of a and g allowed
predicting the solvent dependence of iodide affinity in water/DMSO,
and the curve thus obtained well reproduces the anion affinity of 1 observed in 70 vol % water/DMSO (Figure S16). Furthermore, Figure 4 indicates that the ΔG values
calculated on the basis of the individual correlations reasonably
well describe the experimental ones although deviations are certainly
evident. Altogether, these results therefore support the assumption
that ΔGtr, which is related to anion
desolvation, and α, a solvent descriptor that we expect to relate
to the solvent reorganization at the binding site of the receptor
upon complex formation, are very likely the major factors influencing
the solvent dependence of the anion binding of 1. Other
factors likely play an additional but presumably less decisive role.

We also tested whether this correlation extents to the individual
enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding strength. Figure 5 summarizes how the
enthalpies and entropies of iodide and sulfate binding by 1 vary with solvent composition.

Figure 5 Dependence of the enthalpy of sulfate
(a) and iodide (b) binding
and the entropy of sulfate (c) and iodide (d) binding to bis(cyclopeptide) 1 on the solvent composition (water/methanol, black; water/acetonitrile,
red; water/DMSO, blue).

The graphs in Figure 5 show that the enthalpies and entropies of anion complexation
vary
with solvent composition in a relatively complex fashion. Enthalpy
typically becomes more favorable when increasing the amount of the
organic component in the high-water-content region of the solvent
mixtures. The curves then go through a minimum, after which a further
increase in the amount of the organic solvent causes the favorable
contribution of binding enthalpy to become smaller again. This behavior,
which has previously been observed for water/methanol,21e clearly extends to water/acetonitrile. The
difference is that the local minimum of binding enthalpy is located
at ca. 70 mol % of water in water/methanol, independent of the anion,
whereas it is located at 90 mol % in water/acetonitrile. Binding is
enthalpically less favorable in mixtures in which the organic component
predominates than in mixtures with a higher water content. In water/acetonitrile,
the enthalpic contribution to iodide binding between 40 and 20 mol
% of water is in fact almost zero, which renders a reliable quantification
of binding affinity difficult in this region. Once the organic component
exceeds 80 mol %, there is another pronounced change in the thermodynamics
of binding associated with a strong improvement of binding enthalpy
so that iodide binding in methanol and acetonitrile eventually ends
up to be enthalpically strongly favored in the pure organic solvents.

The solvent dependence of binding entropy mostly mirrors that of
binding enthalpy: favorable contributions of binding enthalpy are
usually associated with less favorable contributions of binding entropy.
Importantly, entropy is generally positive with the only exception
of iodide binding in water/acetonitrile mixtures with a high acetonitrile
content. The only system that does not exhibit enthalpy/entropy compensation
is the sulfate complex of 1 in water/DMSO, where the
increase of the organic component in the solvent causes enthalpy and
entropy to become more favorable. The cause for this effect is currently
not clear.

Understanding the solvent dependence of the individual
thermodynamic
contributions to anion binding of 1 turned out to be
more difficult than understanding the trends of the overall affinity
in terms of ΔG. Correlating, for example, ΔH with ΔHtr and α
provided no satisfactory solution. A qualitative comparison of the
solvent dependence of the enthalpy of iodide binding with the solvent
dependence of several reported solvent properties revealed, however,
an interesting parallel, namely, with the parameter describing the
preferential solvation of iodide anions in water/methanol and water/acetonitrile
mixtures. This parameter has been determined using the inverse Kirkwood–Buff
integral approach33a and is reported in
terms of δxX,S or δxX,W, where negative δxX,S or positive δxX,W values indicate the preferential solvation of an anion X– by water over the solvation by the organic solvent. Values of δxX,S are reported for the solvation of iodide
anions in water/methanol and water/acetonitrile.33b Their solvent dependences are shown in Figure 6 along with the dependence
of the enthalpy of iodide binding of 1 in the respective
solvent.

Figure 6 Dependence of δxX,S describing
the preferential solvation of iodide anions by water over solvation
by methanol (a) or acetonitrile (b) on solvent composition. More negative
values indicate preferred solvation by water. The graphs also show
the solvent dependence of the enthalpy of iodide binding by 1 for comparison.

Although the match is certainly not perfect, the similarities
of
the graphs describing the changes of δxX,S and ΔH with solvent composition
are striking. The courses of the graphs indicate that binding enthalpy
is particularly unfavorable in regions of solvent composition in which
the iodide ion is mostly surrounded by water molecules and enthalpy
benefits from a less pronounced water solvation. These trends can
be rationalized by assuming that changing a thermodynamically favored
state of ion solvation, for example, the preferential solvation of
an anion by water molecules, is enthalpically costly. This explanation
extends to entropy as a pronounced preferential solvation by water
is likely entropically unfavorable, rendering the entropic contribution
of anion desolvation upon complex formation beneficial.

If the
local environment of the anion indeed affects complex formation
to a significant extent, we wondered whether we could also quantitatively
correlate binding enthalpy and the preferential solvation parameter,
δxX,S. Because the graphs in Figure 6 indicate that δxX,S cannot be the only parameter responsible
for the solvent dependence of ΔH, we attempted
to also consider the preferential solvation of the receptor in this
correlation. No quantitative information in this respect is available,
but the solvatochromic behaviors of Reichardt’s dye26b and other dyes34 have been frequently associated with a preferential solvation of
organic molecules. We therefore used the equation ΔH = d δxX,S + eET(30) for the multiparametric analysis.
No satisfactory solution could be found when trying to correlate the
course of ΔH in the full range of solvent compositions,
maybe because ET(30) fails to describe
receptor solvation under certain conditions. However, excluding the
enthalpies of binding in the pure solvents did afford a reasonable
fit, which showed that the preferential solvation of the binding partners
likely controls the enthalpy of binding to some extent (Figure S17). We therefore conclude that the characteristic
distribution of different solvent molecules in the solvation shells
of solutes cannot be neglected when trying to understand their behavior
in mixtures of solvents.

Conclusions
One important outcome
of the work presented here is that bis(cyclopeptides) 1 and 2 bind anions not only in aqueous mixtures
of organic solvents but also in water. In this highly competitive
environment, the weakly coordinating iodide anion is slightly better
bound than the strongly coordinating sulfate anion, indicating that
anion desolvation competes with complex formation to a larger extent
in water than in solvent mixtures. However, sulfate affinity of the
bis(cyclopeptides) in water is still substantial and much higher than
that of other recently described receptors, which do not rely on electrostatic
or coordinative interactions for anion binding.

The ability
of the bis(cyclopeptides) to overcome sulfate hydration
is attributed to the special nature of their binding sites, featuring
a cavity lined by apolar regions of the proline units and the NH groups
of the peptide bonds. Anion complexation thus combines contributions
from the release of water molecules from this concave space3e with N–H···A– interactions. These hydrogen-bonding interactions are sufficiently
hard and strong to induce affinity for strongly coordinating anions.
The bis(cyclopeptides) therefore seem to occupy a position with respect
to anion affinity in water between the glycoluril-derived receptors
and charged or metal-containing ones, the latter of which typically
bind with a higher affinity to strongly coordinating anions.

The second outcome of this work is that at the first sight rather
complex anion-binding properties of 1 and 2 in different solvents and solvent mixtures, for example, the unexpected
low iodide affinity of 1 in DMSO, can be understood and
even quantitatively described by considering well-known solvent parameters
relating to, for example, anion and receptor solvation. Correlating
anion affinity with these parameters can provide information at a
molecular level about factors that affect complex formation. The fact
that the structural complexity of solvent mixtures, which also include
aspects such as microheterogeneity or preferential solvation, has
a profound effect on the thermodynamics of interactions in a host–guest
system is not surprising but often not easy to rationalize. Our results
suggest that the understanding of these effects, particularly in solvent
mixtures frequently used in binding studies, could benefit from the
parameters that have been introduced in the past to describe solvent
effects or solvation phenomena.
