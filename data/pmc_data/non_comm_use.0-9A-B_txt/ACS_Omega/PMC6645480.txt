This
work presents, for the first time, the evaluation on the oxidation
stability of synthetic oils for an aircraft engine using the rapid
small-scale oxidation test (RSSOT) method. Polyol ester lubricants
with and without additives were oxidized at 423 K and 7 bar. The pressure
drop plots show that during the first period of thermal degradation,
the consumption of oxygen is similar for both samples. This part corresponds
to the initiation steps of the mechanism of oxidation. Then, the curve
of the oil without additives reveals an increase in the depletion
of oxygen, corresponding to the kinetic propagation step. Because
of the presence of antioxidants, this phase is not observed for oil-containing
additives. The RSSOT method also allows us to quantify the time needed
for the ester base to produce enough free radicals in order to propagate
the mechanism of oxidation. A methodic comparison with other samples
containing the raw oil and one additive is also proposed.

1 Introduction
Aircraft turbine engines
have to be lubricated in order to reduce
friction and wear between rotating parts.1 During operation, oil is exposed to high thermal stress because
of severe heating, which leads to continuous oil degradation in the
engine due to oxidation. On the other hand, a small part of oil is
lost (typically 0.1 L/h) through venting systems. As results, periodic
refills are required to keep oil levels, which also contributes to
mitigate oil degradation, avoiding the need of complete oil change.
However, future generations of aircraft turbine engines will tend
to operate at higher temperatures thanks to the use of more efficient
materials. At the same time, engine manufacturers are working to reduce
oil consumption. In fact, renewal will also be less effective in offsetting
oil degradation, whereas oxidation will be more severe, which could
ultimately result in a need for complete oil change from the tank
and the system.

Typical lubricant oils used in aircraft engines
are mainly composed
of synthetic esters. Once submitted to high thermal stress, synthetic
ester oils suffer degradation because of oxidation, which is characterized
by the formation of free radicals. Several studies have been carried
out on this subject2−5 in order to determine the mechanism of radical degradation, which
can be described into four main stages: the initiation step corresponding
to the formation of free radicals such as R•, the
propagation step to the formation of hydroperoxides ROOH, and the
autocatalysis step and the termination step to the formation of nonradical
products.6,7 Alcohols are nonradical products, which
may be primary, secondary, or tertiary. It is known that in the presence
of an excess of oxygen, the primary and secondary alcohols will, respectively,
form aldehydes and ketones. Then, the aldehydes will decompose into
carboxylic acids, which could raise the total acid number of the oil.
The molecules produced are light, oil-soluble, and volatile compounds.
As the degradation progresses, the oxidized products will polymerize
and form deposits such as sludge and varnish.8 It is hence very important to follow the changes induced in the
oil composition through its oxidation, as well as the evolution of
the degradation products, in order to guarantee acceptable lubricant
and heat transfer properties and avoid the formation of deposits in
the turbine engine lubrication system.

This degradation results
in a significant change of colors, viscosity
increase, higher acidity, formation of sludge and varnish, corrosion,
and so forth. The oxidation stability is consequently one of the most
important parameters responsible for the ageing of lubricants.9,10

Hence, antioxidant agents are used to extend the life of the
oil
by consuming the free radicals and therefore blocking the propagation
step.6,11 The exchange of a hydrogen atom is fast
and takes place intermolecularly. Moreover, the delocalization of
electron into the ring compound of the radical formed from the antioxidant
is stable, hindering the propagation of this free radical.12−14 The most commonly used antioxidants in lubricating oil are secondary
aromatic amines such as phenyl-1-naphtylamine (PAN, C16H13N) and dioctyldiphenylamine (DODPA, C28H43N).15,16

Several methods have been
used to understand the thermal stability
of lubricating oil such as the method 5308 of FED-STD-791 (corrosiveness
and oxidation stability of light oils) or ASTM D4636 (Standard Test
Method for Corrosiveness and Oxidation Stability of Aircraft Turbine
Engine Lubricants) which is a combination of techniques 5307.2 and
5308.7 of FED-STD-791.17−20 However, these methods are extremely time-consuming. In this work,
we aimed to accelerate the chemical reactions having access to a high
level of oxidation at a laboratory scale. The oxidation of a commercial
lubricant has been therefore performed in a PetroOxy device. This
innovating study presents the results on the oxidation of aircraft
turbine lubricant by rapid small-scale oxidation test (RSSOT). The
technique is mainly for automotive fuels (ASTM D7545) in order to
study the oxidation stability of the component.13,21−24 RSSOT oxidation provides a fast determination of the amount of oxygen
consumed through the measurement of the total pressure inside the
autoclave reactor (PetroOxy).

The goal of this study is thus
to use RSSOT oxidation results as
a tool leading to a better understanding of the oxidation of a commercial
aircraft lubricant, as well as of the role of the different antioxidant
agents contained.

2 Results and Discussion
For a better understanding, the analysis of the oxidation of the
ester base of the lubricant was first conducted and then a mixture
of the ester base with one additive at the time [PAN, DODPA, and tricresylphosphate
(TCP)] was used to complete the formulation of the lubricants. Then,
the influence of different parameters such as temperature and pressure
on the oxidation of aircraft turbine lubricant was performed using
PetroOxy. At the end of each reaction, for each oil sample except
for ester base without additives, which was colorless, the color went
from orange to brown/black as described in other study.6 However, no formation of deposits was observed.

2.1 Antioxidant Role of Different Additives
2.1.1 Oxidation
Stability of the Neopolyol Ester
Base Oil
Figure 1 shows the PetroOxy oxidation experiments performed at 700
kPa and 150 °C on the additive-free pristine neopolyol ester
(lubricant oil without additives). The extremely fast degradation
of the ester in the absence of additives becomes evident by the loss
of pressure after 15 h. The oxidation curve of the additive-free ester
can be divided into two phases: a first part corresponding to the
initiation step of the oxidation reaction, followed by a second step
that can be assigned to the propagation of the reaction, also called
the acceleration phase, and is typical of free radical involving reaction
mechanisms.13 The initiation part of the
curve takes place during the first 9 h of reaction (Figure 1). The rate of oxygen consumption,
that is, the slope of the curve, is relatively slow, in comparison
to that of the subsequent propagation step. During this initiation
period, the first radicals are formed out of the neopolyol ester molecule.6,7 Moreover, oxygen needs to diffuse from the gas to the bulk of the
liquid phase where it will react.3 Upon
approximately 9 h of reaction, this concentration is enough to trigger
the propagation phase. When no additives are present, the propagation
step occurs rapidly and radicals are consumed and formed again attacking
the neopolyol ester molecules.

degradation at T = 150 °C—determination
of the time of the initiation step.

Figure 2 contains
the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra recorded
for the additive-free pristine neopolyol ester submitted to the PetroOxy
experiment compared with the spectra of the fresh oil. The region
between 1110 and 1210 and 1550 and 1850 cm–1 contains,
respectively, the absorbance bands typical of the ester’s C–O
and C=O bonds.25 The C–O
bond shows the formation of primary alcohols, which might lead to
the production of aldehyde because of the change in the carbonyl bond
C=O of the ester. The alteration in the peak could show that
the ester bond is attacked by free radicals but still remains a C=O
bond belonging to an aldehyde or a ketone. As seen previously, if
the alcohols produced are primary, the reaction with the excess of
oxygen leads to an aldehyde. At the end of the experiment, there is
no formation of the C–H bond neither the O–H bond, that
is, the aldehydes and the carboxylic acids were not produced.

2.1.2 Single-Additive-Containing
Lubricants: PAN
and DODPA Roles
For the following experiments, the solutions
were oxidized in the PetroOxy device at 150 °C, 700 kPa, until
a pressure drop of 40% was attained.

For both antioxidants,
the evolution of the pressure drop curve and FTIR results is the same
(Figures 3 and 4), pointing that their behavior against oxidation
is identical. Moreover, Figure 3 evidences the antioxidant effect of PAN and DODPA by stopping
the propagation step (no rapid pressure drops are observed for oxidation
of the blends). It is known that secondary aromatic amines are very
reactive toward peroxy radicals leading to the formation of amino
radical. Nevertheless, on contrary to free radicals generated from
the ester, which would propagate the oxidation, amino radicals would
increase the oxidation stability by deprotonating hydroperoxyde (which
also regenerate a free radical) to generate dimers and trimers which
can also react with a free radical.26

pressure drop curves vs time for oil degradation at T = 150 °C: blue oil without additives, green ester
oil with PAN, and violet ester oil with DODPA.

Figure 4 FTIR–ATR for mixtures of ester base with PAN (blue) and
DODPA (green) ageing in the PetroOxy.

Kinetic reaction constant kapp and
the rate of the oxygen depletion noted as vO2moy corresponding to the slope of the oxygen curve were
determined for each experiment. The curve of evolution of pressure
as a function of the time represents the rate of the reaction between
the oil and the oxygen (eq 1). 1  

In the PetroOxy device, O2 is largely
in excess so the eq 1 becomes eq 2 2  considering the beginning of the experiment
where the concentration of the reactants is stable.

The rate
of oxygen consumption of PAN and DODPA is equal. kapp was 5.22 kPa/h, slightly higher than the
rate measured during the experiment performed for oil without additives,
that is, 4.75 kPa/h. This result could be explained by the fact that
for the mixture of neopolyol ester with an antioxidant, the structure
of the ester undergoes modifications that make it less stable than
only the ester. However, it is worthy to mention that the depletion
rate of PAN and DODPA is different. Indeed, at the end of the oxidation
of the mixtures, PAN was almost completely consumed (only 2% was remaining),
whereas only 57% of DODPA was consumed for the same quantity of oxygen
depletion (404 kPa) (Table 1). This outcome might indicate that the molecule of DODPA
produces active and/or more active compounds, which makes it more
efficient than one molecule of PAN. The easiest dissociation of PAN
amine bonds may explain this fact, that is, the bond dissociation
energy (BDE) of N–H in diphenylamine is 84.7 kcal/mol.27 However, it seems that pointing to a much weaker
BDE for PAN than for DODPA. This being reinforced due to the symmetry
of the DODPA molecule.28

In line with previous results, FTIR spectra (Figure 4) show no sign of
modification of the C=O
and C–O bonds of the ester. PAN and DODPA are good antioxidants.

Figure 5 shows the
chromatograms obtained for a mixture of neopolyol ester formulated
with PAN after oxidation (green) and with DODPA after oxidation (violet).
It was possible to quantify the number of products that comes from
PAN or DODPA, respectively, 33 and 3 products. None of them comes
from both antioxidants. Moreover, for most of the products, their
retention time is smaller than the antioxidants, meaning that they
are more polar than the antioxidants. Unfortunately, it is the only
conclusion that it is possible to know about them without any other
characterization.

during the oxidation at T = 150 °C, (b) identification

and DODPA.

For further studies, it would
be interesting to analyze theses
samples with a mass spectroscopy and to continue the oxidation of
the blends of ester + PAN or ester + DODPA to see what would happen
in the case where the antioxidant will be completely consumed (if
the propagation step will appear or not).

2.1.3 Effect
of TCP
The additive tested
in this section is an antiwear: the TCP. Ester base oil was mixed
with 3 wt %29 of it. Then, the solution
was oxidized in the same conditions as previously.

Figure 6 presented identical
pressure drop curve to the oxidation of the additive-free pristine
neopolyol ester. An antiwear is clearly not effective in preventing
oxidation. Its role is to limit the wear between parts. These results
show the importance of N–H bond to prevent oxidation. High-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) results show a consumption of TCP of
11% (Table 1) but no
product was detected.

Figure 6 PetroOxy pressure drop curves vs time for oil degradation
at T = 150 °C: blue oil without additives and
red ester
oil with TCP.

Nevertheless, FTIR spectra
(Figure 7) show an
alteration on the C=O bond, meaning
that the degradation produced carbonyl compounds and alcohol products,
which should come from the reaction between ester and oxygen. That
is the reason why it is not possible to detect these compounds by
HPLC (absence of aromatic group in the molecule).

of ester base with TCP (red) ageing
in the PetroOxy.

2.1.4 Influence
of the Presence of Additives
Previous results indicate that
PAN and DODPA are satisfying antioxidants
and that a mixture with TCP has the same behavior than neopolyol ester
against thermo-oxidative degradation. This section is focusing on
the oxidation of the commercial lubricant (with all additives) in
the same conditions as previously (T = 150 °C, P = 700 kPa, ΔP = 40%).

With
the aim of monitoring the remaining concentration of the different
additives, two additional PetroOxy experiments were performed during
8 and 50 h (corresponding, respectively, to the initiation and propagation
step of the reaction). The results of the HPLC analysis for these
tests can be found in Table 1. Figure 9 contains
the FITR spectra recorded for the different lubricants submitted to
these PetroOxy experiments.

Figure 8 shows that
the initiation part of the curve is overlapped for both the commercial
lubricant and the additive-free ester. The antioxidant effect of additives
remains latent. The concentration of radical species in the media
continues increasing.

Figure 8 PetroOxy pressure drop curves vs time for oil degradation
at T = 150 °C: blue oil without additives, orange
oil
with additives, green ester oil with PAN, and violet ester oil with
DODPA.

In the commercial lubricant and
thus in the presence of additives,
the additive molecules stop the radicals to attack the ester by reacting
with them.11 This results in additive consumption,
but at the same time in the protection of the ester against oxidation.
Radicals are quenched through reaction with the additive molecules,
being no longer involved in the oxidation mechanism. Consequently,
the rate of oxygen consumption during the propagation step is considerably
slowed down. The presence of the additives is thus the cause of this
antioxidant effect that clearly enhances the oxidation stability of
the lubricant.30

Upon 8 h of reaction,
that is, at the end of the initiation phase,
the consumption of PAN reaches 62%, whereas DODPA has been consumed
to a very small extent, that is, 13%. This means that a certain amount
of the radicals formed during the initiation step did already react
with PAN molecules. The ester molecules are well preserved from oxidation
during this first 8 h of reaction, as confirmed by the almost identical
FTIR spectra obtained for the oxidized lubricant and the fresh one
(Figure 9). PAN is completely consumed upon 50 h of oxidation,
as well as half of the initial amount of DODPA. At this point of the
reaction, we are in the propagation step and DODPA follows PAN taking
the lead in the neutralization of the radicals. Still, the ester molecule
has been already attacked to a certain extent because the FTIR profile
already evidences the formation of short chain products and alcohols
as degradation products. Upon 102 h of reaction, and corresponding
to a pressure drop of 40%, more than 80% of the initial DODPA has
been consumed and the oxidation of the ester becomes even more evident
in the FTIR spectra. At this point, the peak characteristic of alcohol
formation (C–O bond) presents very similar shape and intensity
than the one observed in the PetroOxy-oxidized additive-free ester.
On the contrary, the carbonyl bond in the ester appears more degraded
for this last one than in the additive-containing lubricant oxidized
during 102 h. Though a quantitative analysis of FTIR profiles is not
straightforward, it may seem that alcohol formation has reached the
same limit and that in the absence of additives, the oxidation mechanism
follows different pathways not specially leading to the formation
of alcohols but of other degradation products.

Figure 9 FTIR–ATR for oil
with and without additives ageing in the
PetroOxy.

PAN is the first additive that
reacts protecting ester against
oxidation. In fact, Hunter et al. showed that PAN reacts in order
to limit the formation of radicals and hydroperoxides and thus to
limit the initiation step.25

Moreover, Table 1 shows that the rate
of oxygen consumption kapp of the commercial
lubricant is slower than one of the mixture
of neopolyol ester and PAN or DODPA. This decrease could be explained
by the synergistic effects of antioxidants.31 For oil in the presence of additives, 79% of DODPA was consumed
and only 57% for the mixture between neopolyol ester and DODPA, whereas
for PAN, the rate of consumption of the additive was equal for the
commercial lubricant and the mixture. This shows that oxidation mechanism
of PAN in the presence or the absence of other additives is the same,
whereas the one with DODPA is different. It is possible that DODPA
also reacts with other products formed during the oxidation, which
would explain the results obtained.

The comparison of HPLC chromatograms
(Figure 10) between
standard oil (orange) and the
mixture indicates that most of the products formed from PAN or DODPA
are present in the commercial lubricant. Four types of product are
observed: numbers 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 from PAN seems to be higher for
the lubricant than for the mixture with PAN because of the height
of the peaks; 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 from PAN and 1 and 3 from DODPA
look to be in the same proportions, compound numbers 1, 12, and 13
from PAN and 2 from DODPA assume to be higher than if it is formed
in the standard oil oxidized and finally some products are present
in the lubricant and not in the blends. Those last ones could be from
the reaction from both antioxidants. The presence of other additives
should have an impact on the formation of these products.

Figure 10 HPLC chromatograms
of commercial oil before oxidation (black),
after oxidation (orange) and blends of ester oil with PAN (green)
and ester oil with DODPA after oxidation (violet).

Furthermore, some of the products detected with
standard oil after
oxidation were not formed for the mixtures, which should also confirm
the synergistic effects of antioxidants.

2.2 Influence
of the Temperature on the Oxidation
of the Lubricant
Last, after the study on the oxidation of
neopolyol ester mixed with additives, this part will discuss about
the important parameters that could influence thermo-oxidative degradation.

The commercial lubricant oil was oxidized at three different temperatures
(100, 150, and 200 °C), and at an initial oxygen pressure of
700 kPa, until a pressure drop of 40% was reached.

Figure 11 shows
the evolution of pressure, and thus the oxygen consumption, as a function
of time for the oxidation of the lubricant at the three reaction temperatures.
It should be mentioned that though the initial pressure at ambient
temperature was fixed at 700 kPa, the heating of the autoclave reactor
up to each targeted temperature results in an increase of the pressure
that can be clearly observed in the curves. The 40% pressure drop
threshold was in fact calculated using these oxygen pressures as a
reference. The longer heating up period in the case of the PetroOxy
experiment performed at 200 °C is moreover the cause of the artifact
observed at very incipient reaction times, that is, an initial increase
in the pressure can be observed in this case corresponding to the
first 10–15 min of the test. In that case, the extent of each
reaction is not the same but first conclusions can be drawn by these
experiments.

Figure 11 PetroOxy pressure drop curves vs time for oil degradation
at T = 100 °C (blue), 150 °C (orange),
and 200 °C
(green).

It is important to state that
because the oxidation implies two
reactants in a different physical state, the reaction mostly occurs
at the surface of the liquid, which is the contact area of the oxygen
and the oil.

At 100 °C, the oxygen consumption decreases
slowly with time,
corresponding to a long induction phase (Figure 11a). The formation of the oxidation products
is also slow because very small differences were observed in the FTIR
spectra of the fresh and the 100 °C oxidized lubricant, as will
be commented later on. Even though, at the end of the experiment (more
than 100 h), the oxidation consumed 70% of the antioxidant PAN (Table 1). PAN starts playing
its antioxidant role already at temperatures as low as 100 °C
which is not the case of DODPA. No consumption was detected (Table 1). At this relatively
low temperature, the consumption of PAN seems enough to protect the
lubricant against oxidation.

Figure 11 clearly
evidences that increasing the temperature results in a reduction of
the reaction time, that is, oxygen is consumed significantly faster
until the 40% pressure drop threshold is achieved. Temperature boosts
the oxidation rate by providing increasing thermal energy. The rate
of the oxygen diffusion will also increase. Both facts can contribute
to an enhanced deprotonation of the core ester molecule of the lubricant,
leading to faster oxidation. Moreover, already at 150 °C (Figure 11b) and even more
remarkably at 200 °C (Figure 11c), a change in the oxygen consumption rate, that is,
pressure decreases as a function of time—slope of the curve,
can be observed. This occurs at about 45 h reaction time for the PetroOxy
experiment performed at 150 °C and much earlier, at about 10
h reaction time, for the experiment performed at 200 °C.

Kinetic reaction constant kapp determined
for each experiment. Table 1 shows that increasing the temperature by 50 °C increases
the reaction rate by six to seven times and because of the consumption
of the reactants over time, which decrease the frequency of the collisions
between molecules. kapp is almost equal
to vO2moy at 150 °C. The
difference between vO2 and kapp observed for 100 and 200 °C implies
that there are important parameters which are not consider in eq 1.

Then, in this section,
on the basis of the Arrhenius eq 3 describing the temperature dependence
of the reaction rate constant, the activation energy of these experiments
was determinate by plotting the graph of ln k versus
1/T. The activation energy obtained equals to 56.34
kJ/mol. 3  

At the same time, the results of the HPLC analysis
(Table 1) point to
a complete consumption
of PAN at 150 °C, together with an important consumption of DODPA
(79% consumed at 150 °C, 93% consumed at 200 °C) and an
incipient consumption of TCP, an antiwear additive, which becomes
noticeable at 200 °C (17% consumed). This might be the reason
why PAN and DODPA are both used as an antioxidant. It is therefore
possible that the implication of DODPA in the reaction mechanism,
upon the complete consumption of PAN, causes a change in the reaction
mechanism that becomes visible in the curves through the change in
the slope observed at 150 and 200 °C. Higher reaction temperatures,
and thus further acceleration of the oxidation process, are needed
thus for activating the DODPA antioxidant and for observing its effect
into the overall oxidation mechanism. Once DODPA takes the lead, the
oxidation rate is further slowed down, as can be deduced from the
decreased slope in this part of the PetroOxy curves. The consumption
rates of PAN and DODPA are different. The results presented in Table 1 also evidence a non-negligible
consumption of TCP, pointing to a possible antioxidant role of this
antiwear additive but confirmed by the first results that TCP does
not.

The infrared spectra of the fresh and the oxidized lubricant
are
presented in Figure 12. Upon PetroOxy oxidation, the intensity of the carbonyl peak decreases
as it becomes broader; this being accompanied by the apparition of
a shoulder at lower wavenumbers. This becomes particularly evident
for the lubricant oxidized at 200 °C, being already remarkable
in the FTIR spectrum corresponding to the lubricant oxidized at 150
°C. This shoulder corresponds to the formation of oxidation products,
which also contain a carbonyl bond. It should be mentioned that the
O–H bond from carboxylic acids was never detected in these
FTIR patterns. Shorter chain, lower molecular weight products may
be formed as a consequence of the breakdown of the C–O bond
because the spectra do not point to a set off of the polymerization
phase.6 Indeed, at temperatures of 150
°C and higher, derived primary alcohol products start to be produced,
as pointed out by the presence of a band of increased intensity appearing
at about 1064 cm–1 as the intensity of the peak
C–O decreases.

Figure 12 FTIR–ATR results for oil ageing at different temperatures
in the PetroOxy.

Even if the extent of
the reaction is not the same, all of these
results show that below 150 °C, the temperature is too low to
initiate the dissociation of the N–H bond in DODPA and PAN
is therefore playing the main role as an antioxidant, quite efficiently
protecting the core neopolyol ester molecules of the lubricant from
oxidation. From 150 °C and on, an important oxidation extent
is observed, resulting in the formation of short chain, lower molecular
weight oxidation products. Because the temperatures reached in an
aircraft turbine engine are rarely as high as 200 °C, a temperature
of 150 °C was chosen to perform the study of the influence of
the oxygen initial pressure and of the role of the different additives.

Figure 13 shows
the chromatograms obtained for oil oxidized at 100, 150, and 200 °C.
Each peak corresponds to a product of the oxidation and is an aromatic
compound. They come from PAN or DODPA. The number of products increases
with the temperature until 150 °C (17 peaks detected for oil
oxidized at 100 °C and 25 peaks at 150 °C) and then decreases
at 200 °C (22 peaks) but the identification was not possible
in this work.

oxidized
oil (black), oxidized oil at 100 °C (blue), 150 °C (orange),
and 200 °C (green).

2.3 Influence of the Initial Pressure on the Oxidation
of the Lubricant
In order to analyze the influence of the
initial oxygen pressure during the PetroOxy oxidation of the commercial
lubricant, two experiments were performed at 200 and 700 kPa and at
a temperature of 150 °C, setting the pressure drop threshold
delimiting the end of the experiment at 20% (instead of 40%). The
pressure versus time curves obtained are depicted in Figure 14.

Figure 14 PetroOxy pressure drop
curves vs time for oil degradation at P = 200 kPa
and P = 700 kPa.

Because of the highest initial pressure registered for the
PetroOxy
experiment performed at 700 kPa (1010 kPa at 150 °C), the 20%
pressure drop threshold was attained upon 43 h reaction, whereas the
experiment performed at 200 kPa (289 kPa at 150 °C) was finished
after 26 h reaction. The rate of oxygen consumption was also different.
With 198 kPa depleted in 43 h, the oxygen consumption rate for the
experiment performed at 700 kPa was 4.66 kPa/h, almost two times higher
than the rate measured during the experiment performed at 200 kPa,
that is, 2.51 kPa/h. This fact points to faster oxidation as the initial
oxygen pressure increases. Higher oxygen pressure increases the concentration
of the gas inside the autoclave reactor and thus enhanced the oxygen
diffusion inside the liquid lubricant sample, thus resulting in increased
oxidation rate. Koh and Butt3 showed that
there are three main steps to be considered in the oxidation of a
poly(α-olefin) lubricant. Oxygen is first transferred from the
gas phase to the interface with the liquid phase, then dissolved into
the bulk of the liquid phase, and then consumed in the oxidation reaction
occurring in this liquid phase. Oxygen partial pressure in the gas
phase might have thus an effect on two parameters concerning the overall
oxidation process: the intrinsic rate of the chemical reaction and
the transport of the oxygen from the gas phase into the liquid phase.

Once again, the extent of each reaction in this section is not
the same but what can be noticed is that PAN is the first antioxidant
to be consumed, that is, complete consumption upon oxidation at 700
kPa, whereas 29% of the initial amount of this additive still remained
in the one oxidized at 200 kPa (Table 1). DODPA consumption was therefore higher when performing
oxidation at 700 kPa instead of 200 kPa, though reaction at 200 kPa
was already stringent enough to start involving the antioxidant effect
(and consumption) of DODPA.

The infrared spectra acquired for
this series of oxidized lubricants
are shown in Figure 15. Oxidation at 200 kPa does not result in visible chemical changes
in the core of the neopolyol ester because the FTIR spectrum obtained
for carbonyl bond is practically the same one acquired for the fresh
lubricant. However, the decrease of the intensity of the C–O
bond from the ester lead to the formation of C–O bond corresponding
to the formation of primary alcohols as oxidation products. Moreover,
at 700 kPa, the spectrum also evidences the modification of carbonyl
bond.

the PetroOxy.

3 Conclusions
The PetroOxy device can be used to study the oxidation stability
of neopolyol ester lubricants. This method combined with HPLC analysis
shows that:PAN is first to
play its antioxidant role at temperatures
as low as 100 °C—BDE of PAN is much weaker than that for
DODPA;

33 products were observed, coming
from PAN;

when DODPA step in the oxidation
mechanism that causes
a change in the reaction mechanism that could be observed in the curves
of oxygen depletion at higher temperatures;

only three products were detected from DODPA; and

by combining both antioxidants, it is possible to further
increase the oxidation stability of the lubricant because of their
synergistic effect.



Moreover mass spectrometry
can identify the detection of products
from antioxidant degradation by HPLC. This was not investigated in
this work but might be the topic of further studies.

FTIR analyses
show the degradation of the two main bonds of the
ester:the carbonyl bond corresponding
to the formation of
oxidation products such as aldehydes and ketones;

and the C–O bond, which lead to the generation
of alcohol products.

No other bonds corresponding
to carboxylic acids, polymers,
or oligomers have been detected.



A correlation
could be made between infrared spectrometry and liquid
chromatography. Degradation on the neopentyl ester oil could be predicted
by the value of remaining concentration in oxidized oil.

Furthermore,
PetroOxy can provide the time needed for the oxidation
reaction of the synthetic ester to go through his initiation to the
propagation step. At 150 °C, 9 h of reaction is necessary to
increase the concentration of radical species to trigger the propagation
phase. Increasing the temperature would decrease the time before oxygen
depletion.

RSSOT is a good alternative method to understand
and measure the
oxidation stability of the synthetic ester lubricant. It is a fast
and simple technique. Monitoring oxygen consumption enables to determine
the effect of the antioxidant and the two main steps of oxidation
mechanism. In order to confirm these results, it would be necessary
to oxidize a sample of oil without additive at 200 °C. Unfortunately,
this was not possible in our case because the temperature maximal
of use of the PetroOxy device available in our work was 160 °C.

Results obtained can be a step forward toward evaluation of the
oxidation stability of synthetic ester lubricant by the RSSOT method.
More data are needed to complete the understanding of the behavior
of the oil using this device.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Lubricating Oil and Antioxidants
The compounds used
in this work were the same as typically used in
a standard aircraft turbine lubricant. The ester base of the oil,
obtained by the esterification of pentaerythritol with saturated monocarboxylic
acids having carbon atom number from C5 to C10,31,32 was a commercial ester base oil. Two different
antioxidants, PAN (C16H13N) and DODPA (C28H43N), and also antiwear TCP (C21H21O4P) were supplied by the manufacturer.

The solutions containing neopolyol ester base oil and different additives
were stirred together at 80 °C in a beaker until homogeneity.
Percentage of the additives was considered in the same proportioned
as in the standard oil (1–2 wt % for antioxidants (PAN and
DODPA were mixed in the same amount) and 3 wt % for antiwear).16

4.2 Accelerated Oxidation Tests
The PetroOxy
device was conceived to study the oxidation stability according to
three parameters: the temperature, the initial oxygen pressure, and
the time of the experiment. The apparatus is well described elsewhere.33

In each experience, 5 mL of oil sample
was placed into the cell of the PetroOxy apparatus at ambient temperature.
A screw cap and a safety hood hermetically seal the cell. In order
to drain all the gas inside, pure oxygen (Air Liquide, ALPHAGAZ 1
Oxygen) was injected until the initial pressure of 700 kPa and then
evacuated two times. After purging, the cell was pressurized once
again with pure oxygen at 700 kPa, the oil sample being heated up
to the specified temperature. A data acquisition system monitored
the decrease of the pressure during the entire experiment, which last
until ΔP = Pmax – P = 40% (stop criterion defined in this
work). The PetroOxy experiments were carried out on an oil without
additives and solutions of neopolyol ester base oil mixed with each
one of the antioxidants at a temperature of 150 °C and a pressure
of 700 kPa being the pressure use in the standard normalized tests
for the characterization of the oxidation stability of aeronautical
and automotive fuels. Finally, the oxidation was carried out on an
oil with additives (standard oil) at three different temperatures:
100, 150, and 200 °C, and then at two different initial pressures:
200 and 700 kPa, at a fixed temperature of 150 °C. The fresh
and oxidized lubricants were characterized by means of different physico-chemical
techniques (FTIR and HPLC). It is essential to monitor the remaining
concentration of antioxidant in the oil after oxidation by liquid
chromatography as an indicator for the extent of oil oxidation.29,34

4.3 High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
The HPLC was performed on Waters e2695 equipped with a diode array
detector UV e2998. An oil sample (100 mg) was first diluted in 10
mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF). A 10 μL volume of this solution
was then injected into a stainless steel column (Waters XSelect type
CSH C18, 250 × 4.6 mm ID, 5 μm particle size). Water and
acetonitrile (ACN) were used as the solvent for the mobile phase in
a gradient mode. The temperature of the column was maintained at 40
°C and the samples at 4 °C. The pump flow rate was set to
1 mL/min. The wavelength of detection was 254 nm. This technique was
used to monitor the quantitative results of antioxidant depletion
by a comparison of peak area.

Figure 16 shows a typical chromatograph of the lubricant
before ageing. One peak at a specific retention time corresponds to
one specific molecule. In our case, PAN is detected at 15.97 min,
TCP at 17.14 min, and DODPA at 23.82 min.

fresh oil. Retention time of the additives:
PAN 15.97 min; (middle) TCP 17.14 min; and (right) DODPA 23.82 min.

4.4 Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FTIR was performed using
a Bruker spectrometer TENSOR 27. A drop
of lubricant was applied on an attenuated total reflectance (ATR)
cell equipped with a ZnSe single crystal. The spectra were recorded
over the wavelength range of 4000–400 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1 using 16 scans. FTIR
was utilized for monitoring the changes of the structure of the base
oil.

The main chemical bonds of the ester, that is, the carbonyl
bond C=O, appears at 1710 cm–1, and C–O
bond is detected at 1200 cm–1, whereas C–H
bonds, that is, C–H2, C–H3 can
be observed at about 3000 cm–1. The analysis of
the FTIR spectra allows therefore detecting the degradation of the
ester base of the lubricant, through the simple comparison of the
spectra of both oxidized oil and fresh oil. Moreover, after oxidation,
the production of primary alcohols should be observed at 1050 cm–1 (C–O bond) and 1350–1260 cm–1 (O–H bond), aldehydes at 2880–2650 cm–1 (C–H bond) and 1740–1720 cm–1 (C=O
bond) and carboxylic acids or also alcohols with a wide band at 3500
cm–1 (O–H bond).35
