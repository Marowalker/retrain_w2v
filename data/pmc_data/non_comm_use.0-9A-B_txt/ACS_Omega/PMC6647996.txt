The interaction site
of phthalocyanine (Pc) with nitrogen dioxide
(NO2) has been characterized using different methods and
found to be conflicting. By knowing the interaction site, the Pc molecule
can be better customized to improve the gas sensitivity. In this article,
the interaction sites of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) with oxidizing
NO2 or with reducing gas (ammonia, NH3) were
identified using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The
sensitivity of CuPc to sub-ppm levels of the tested gases was established
in the CuPc chemoresistive gas sensors. The analyte–sensor
interaction sites were identified and validated by monitoring the
Cu K-edge XAS before and during gas exposure. From the X-ray absorption
near-edge structure and its first derivative, a low or lack of axial
coordination on the Cu metal center of CuPc is evident. Using the
extended X-ray absorption fine structure with molecular orbital information
of the involved molecules, the macrocycle interaction between CuPc
and NO2 or NH3 was proposed to be the dominant
sensing mechanism on CuPc sensors.

Introduction
The study of the gas
composition in our environment has propelled
gas sensor research for health and safety purposes, such as workplace
safety in industries such as chemical and mining, as well as air-quality
monitoring. One commonly researched gas analytes is nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), an oxidizing gas, which is a byproduct formed from
the combustion of different forms of fossil fuels in industries, power
plants, vehicles, and at home.1,2 Another byproduct from
this fossil fuel combustion is nitric oxide (NO) which oxidizes to
form NO2 in ambient environment.3 As such, the ambient air typically contains NO2 and NO,
which are typically classified as NOx.
NOx poses health risks by affecting the
lung functions of individuals, especially in asthmatic individuals
even at sub-ppm concentrations.1,3−5 In addition, NOx is a component of acid
rain as well as of smog and air pollution, thereby leading to environmental
problems.2−4 Consequently, apart from taking measures to reduce
the production of NOx, the World Health
Organization (WHO) recommends a 1 h guideline of 100 ppb,1 whereas the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a recommended exposure limit (REL) of
1 ppm6 for individuals to reduce the risk
on their health. Another target gas analyte for sensors is ammonia
(NH3), which has seen an increase in its concentration
in the environment over the years because of agriculture and use of
fertilizers.7−9 At low ppm levels, the alkaline reducing gas NH3 can cause irritation to the eyes and breathing pathways.9 Apart from posing health issues, NH3 can also indirectly pose a threat to the environment through its
redox reaction in soil to form nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas.10 In addition to the impact on the environment,
both NOx and NH3 have also
been found in human exhaled breath at sub-ppm levels, where an increase
in concentration has been used as an indication of health or disease.8,11

In view of the applications of the gases at different concentrations,
much research efforts have been focusing on sensors with high sensitivity
to target concentrations with low cross-sensitivity to other gases.
Although high sensitivity to low gas concentrations have been reported,
the challenge lies in achieving high selectivity. Various gas-sensitive
materials have been explored and reported, ranging from inorganic
metal oxide (MOx) to organic compounds
and polymers. For miniaturized sensors, the state-of-the-art material
is MOx, such as indium oxide, zinc oxide,
tungsten oxide, and tin oxide, for NO2 or NH3 sensing.8,12−16 Sensors based on MOx typically
require an additional heater, as the optimum operating temperature
requires hundreds of degree celsius.12,13,15,17 Recent efforts on MOx look into lowering this temperature requirement
by making use of nanostructures, thinner films, or hybrid materials.17−19 Alternatively, organic materials such as carbon nanotube,20−22 pentacene,23,24 polyaniline,23,25,26 poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT),23,24 and metal phthalocyanines (MPcs)23,27−30 have demonstrated sensitivity to various gases, as well as room-temperature
sensing. Although MOx has the advantage
of higher response than organic materials, the possibility for room-temperature
sensing and higher selectivity by substituting various side groups
or metal centers makes organic-sensing materials attractive.27,30 Consequently, one such class of organic materials that have been
investigated for gas-sensing purposes is MPc. MPc is a semiconducting
material because of its 18π delocalized electrons in the Pc
macrocycle with a thermal stability up to hundreds of degree celsius.29 As a result, MPc has been used for sensing in
conductivity-based devices. In addition, this usually thermally evaporated
material can be deposited using solution process after substitution
of side groups into the Pc macrocycle, thereby leading to fabrication
flexibility.30,31 On top of this, the metal center
of MPc can be substituted with most of the metals in the periodic
table,29 thus making the study of MPc for
sensing purposes interesting and necessary.

Apart from investigating
the material’s gas sensitivity
and the effect of different structural properties (i.e., morphology),
one other focus is to understand its analyte–sensor interaction
sites. Most studies have mainly concentrated on nonsubstituted MPc
first-row transition metal such as copper phthalocyanine (CuPc).28,30,32 Pertaining to CuPc, the interaction
with the electron-accepting gas should be located on the macrocycle
based on theoretical calculations by Liao and Scheiner.32 This is supported by the optical characterization
work done by Basova et al. using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
and Raman spectroscopy to determine the interaction mechanism with
NO2 and NH3,33 in
which a macrocycle interaction was reported between CuPc with NO2, whereas a metal center interaction is proposed with NH3. On the contrary, works by Lozzi et al. suggested metal-center
interaction of CuPc with NO2.34 As such, more comprehensive and deterministic studies should be
pursued to establish a thorough understanding. In this work, X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used to characterize the interaction
sites to fully understand the sensing mechanism of the gas sensors.
In situ or operando XAS studies have been utilized for various characterization
work to obtain real-time process information or mechanism by looking
into the changes of the target atom’s coordination environment
or oxidation state.35,36 Consequently, this makes in situ
characterization work using XAS with gas dosing, a direct method for
analyzing CuPc that has a single Cu atom surrounded by the Pc macrocycle,
despite which low dose or gas concentration would pose a challenge
to this characterization method.

In this work, in situ XAS study
was carried out with NO2 or NH3 dosing, and
the interaction sites between the
respective gas and CuPc layer were established. We tested the CuPc
chemiresistor for sub-ppm levels of NO2 and NH3 sensing, and the responses of CuPc devices were also analyzed.

Experimental
Section
CuPc Deposition and Chemiresistor Fabrication
Sublimed
grade CuPc of 99% purity was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and thermally
evaporated on cleaned silicon substrate insulated with silicon oxide
at a pressure of 3 × 10–6 mbar and a rate of
0.5 Å/s via Lesker evaporator. For gas measurements, 100 nm CuPc
layer was deposited on top of 6 pairs of interdigitated Au electrodes
with 0.1 mm channel length thermally evaporated at similar pressure
with a rate of 1 Å/s via Mbraun evaporator. Quartz crystal microbalance
in the respective equipment is used to ensure the layer thickness,
which is checked  using surface profiler after deposition.

Layer and Sensor Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were performed on the deposited
CuPc on silicon substrates using Bruker ADVANCE D8 and Asylum Research
Cypher S, respectively. Cu Kα X-ray (λ = 1.5406 Å)
was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA for the XRD measurement, which was
taken between 5° and 30° in steps of 0.018°. The CuPc
layer was scanned using the AFM to obtain 1.5 × 1.5 μm2 images using tapping mode with a scan rate of 1 Hz and processed
using Gwyddion software.

The CuPc chemiresistor sensitivity
to NO2 or NH3 was characterized using a Keithley
2636 with 5 V applied bias as the chemiresistor was exposed to two
cycles of 50–500 ppb dry NO2 or 0.5–2 ppm
NH3 with balance dry air consisting of 20% O2 content at room temperature with no applied heat. Mass flow controllers
(MFCs) from Bronkhorst and automatic valves were connected to a programmable
logic controller (PLC) and the testing protocol was written to a program
control via Labview. In this case, we are able to repeat the gas experiment
easily and accurately based on the set point and duration indicated
for each component. CuPc chemiresistor was dosed to each gas concentration
for 60 s, whereas the recovery in dry air lasted for 120 s. Prior
to the response calculation, the second cycle was first considered
and the current was normalized to the start of the second cycle. The
response was then calculated based on the difference in the normalized
current before and after gas dosing; that is, response [gas, x ppb] = INorm,60s – INorm,0s. To obtain the sensitivity of the chemiresistor
to NO2 or NH3, the response was plotted against
concentration, and the sensitivity was found from the gradient of
the linear fit. To prevent cross-contamination, pristine chemiresistors
were used to characterize the target gas and repeated with fresh samples
for reproducibility.

In Situ XAS Measurement
Cu K-edge
XAS measurement of
200 nm CuPc was taken at the XAFCA beamline facility in Singapore
Synchrotron Light Source (SSLS)37 in fluorescence
mode at room temperature with no vacuum applied. We have used a thicker
layer of CuPc to increase the measured intensity. Initial measurements
were taken before gas dosage. Premixed 10 ppm of NO2 or
NH3 in balance dry air from Linde Gas Singapore was then
released into the measurement chamber, with an outlet to prevent build-up
of the respective gas in the chamber. The data presented are an average
of over 10 scans, and all data have been corrected to the signal of
Cu foil to offset any possible shift across the measurement. Fourier
transformation was also performed to examine the interaction of Cu
with its neighboring atoms and tested gases on the extended X-ray
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region, which has an accuracy of
∼0.01 Å for the bond length.38

Results and Discussion
Sensing-Layer Characterization
The
morphology of the
deposited CuPc layers on blank substrates was characterized using
AFM and shown in Figure 1, where the CuPc layers are comprised of grains growing normal to
the substrate. Both 100 and 200 nm CuPc layers have similar packing
density, and the root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) was found to be 2.96 and 4.31 nm, respectively for the
layers. The grains of 200 nm CuPc layer can be observed to be bigger
than its thinner counterpart (Figure 1).

Figure 1 AFM images of (a) 100 and (b) 200 nm CuPc on blank Si/SiO2 substrates.

Highly oriented crystal structure can be observed in the
100 and
200 nm CuPc layers, with a single XRD peak at 7.14° that is equivalent
to the lattice spacing d = 12.4 Å (Figure 2). The intensity
of this single peak is also observed to be greater in 200 nm CuPc
layer than in its 100 nm counterpart. The crystallinity in both samples
is advantageous for reproducing XAS measurements, as will be described
later.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of 100 and 200 nm CuPc layers on blank substrates.

CuPc layers (100 and 200 nm) were
characterized using AFM and XRD.
The main differences between these layers lie in bigger grains and
higher crystallinity of the thicker layer, which is in agreement with
previous works carried out in studying Pc layers of different thicknesses.39,40 However, given that the differences between the two CuPc layers
are less than two times, it is assumed that XAS measurements taken
with 200 nm CuPc layer would be similar for 100 nm CuPc layer.

Gas Measurement
Chemiresistors with 100 nm CuPc deposited
were dosed with varying concentrations of NO2 or NH3 in balance dry synthetic air. For each of the current measurement
made at room temperature with a bias voltage of 5 V, fresh, pristine
samples were used to prevent residual effects of previous NO2 or NH3 gas exposure.

Exposure of the CuPc chemiresistor
to oxidizing gas NO2 results in a positive change in the
current, as shown in Figure 3a. On the other hand, negative current change was observed
when the pristine CuPc chemiresistors were exposed to varying concentrations
of reducing gas NH3 (Figure 4a). The current of the chemiresistors also does not
recover fully to the pre-exposure level after 120 s, as seen in both Figures 3 and 4. By comparing the response of CuPc chemiresistors to either
gas, an opposite current change upon gas exposure is due to the gas
properties, that is, oxidizing and reducing gases. In exposing CuPc
chemiresistors to either gas, the current changes linearly with the
target gas concentration, as seen in Figures 3b and 4b. The chemiresistors
also displayed a lower current change, and hence lower sensitivity
to NH3 than NO2, even though higher NH3 concentrations were used. This is reflected in the repeated measurements
made to obtain the average sensitivity of CuPc chemiresistors to NO2 or to NH3 (Table 1). Specifically, 5 pristine chemiresistors were used
for each gas, resulting in a total of 10 chemiresistors used. The
gradient from the response against concentration plot, such as Figures 3b and 4b, was taken as the sensitivity.

the current was normalized to the start of the second dosing cycle.

Sensing Mechanism and Interaction
Positive and negative
current changes observed in the CuPc chemiresistors because of exposure
to NO2 or to NH3, respectively, can be attributed
to the electron transfer between the gas and CuPc sensing layer. In
particular, the electron transfer from CuPc to NO2 has
been reported to form holes in CuPc, leading to the increase in current
of the p-type CuPc sensing layer.33,41 On the other
hand, the electron donation from the NH3 gas to CuPc results
in the depletion of holes, thereby reducing the current, as seen in
our results. Although the observations of the changes in the measured
current of CuPc devices as exposed to NO2 or NH3 can be explained to be because of the electron transfer, the interaction
sites at the macrocycle or metal center have not been clarified. Prior
to the determination of the interaction site, the bonding characteristics
of CuPc will be first discussed.

In CuPc, the Cu atom is coordinate
bonded to the Pc macrocycle, leading to hybridization of the orbitals
of Cu and Pc macrocycle. Consequently, the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were
found to be a1u (π) and 2eg (π*)
orbitals respectively, with a Pc macrocycle character.32 It should be noted that for the HOMO and LUMO
of MPc, higher metal character is possible, that is in FePc. In the
case of MPc HOMO, as the d orbitals are filled up across the period,
the metal 1eg d orbital can be found lower in energy, leading
to less metal character.32 As a result,
CuPc HOMO and LUMO have mainly a Pc macrocycle character because of
its almost-filled d orbital. Subsequently, it is expected that in
the interaction of CuPc sensing layer with NO2 or NH3, the Pc macrocycle will be involved. However, we would like
to reiterate that there is a lack of consensus or agreement in the
interaction site between the tested gas with CuPc in literature so
far.

Without considering the frontier orbitals of CuPc, there
are four
possible interaction sites, such as on the pyrrole, bridging N atom
or benzo moiety of Pc macrocycle, as well as on the axial of Cu atom.
Upon interaction of CuPc with the gas analyte, there are not only
electrical changes but also chemophysico changes, such as a change
in the bond distance. In the XAS measurements of Cu atoms with its
neighboring atoms, normalized Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) measurement of pristine 200 nm CuPc layer on blank
substrate before and after exposure to NO2 or to NH3 are monitored, as shown in Figure 5. Pristine samples that have only been exposed
to environmental air were used for each test, and any drift was corrected
by using the reference Cu foil.

Figure 5 Normalized Cu K-edge XANES of pristine
200 nm CuPc on blank substrate
before and during exposure to NO2 or to NH3.

It has been established in various
research work that CuPc has
a square planar structure with D4h configuration.32,42 Subsequently, a lack of features
at the pre-edge and rising edge of the XANES of the pristine CuPc
sample (Figure 5) can
be obtained because of this centrosymmetric structure.43,44 Upon exposure to low concentrations of NO2 or NH3, a left shift in the rising edge can be seen. Although such
shift is typically linked to a change in oxidation state, a change
in the molecular structure or orbital overlap with bonded ligands
may also cause such a shift.45−47 In our case, it may be deduced
that there is a reduction in Cu2+ of CuPc, but the left
shift seen in our results could also be because of the change in the
CuPc structure from square planar, as well as hybridization of ligands
with Cu d-orbitals. Although the nature of the shift will be further
discussed below, the left shift observed in XANES in Figure 5 verified the existence of
an interaction between CuPc and the gas (NO2 or NH3).

From the first derivative (Figure 6) of the normalized XANES in Figure 5, an ca. 5 eV shift from the
elemental Cu
K-edge with an energy of 8979 eV shows the +2 oxidation state of the
CuPc layer.43,48 It is noted that the rising edge,
ca. 8984 eV, of pristine CuPc layer here is similar to the reported
value of CuPc layer that was deposited using glow discharge sublimation
method.49 In Figure 6, two main peaks  labeled as peak A
and peak B were obtained and can be correlated with 1s → 4p
transition. Furthermore, details on the distortion from ligands bonded
on axial position can be derived from peak A.43,50 In our case, the distortion because of ligands in axial position
of Cu in CuPc is inferred to be low, given the low intensity of peak
A in all three spectra.

Figure 6 First derivative of normalized XANES of 200
nm CuPc before exposure
to target gas (pristine) and during exposure to NO2 or
to NH3 with peak A and B relating to the 1s → 4p
transition.

Fourier-transformed EXAFS
of CuPc layer before and during gas exposure
is shown in Figures 7 and 8 for NO2 and NH3, respectively. The first major peak in both figures represents the
shortest bond between Cu metal center with its neighboring atoms,
and in CuPc, this is the Cu–N bond formed between the metal
center and the macrocycle. In Figure 7, a left shift, ca 0.03 Å, toward shorter Cu–N
bond can be observed during the exposure of the layer to NO2. On the other hand, there is a lack of such shift in CuPc upon exposure
to NH3 (Figure 8). A repeated measurement with fresh, pristine CuPc layer
to validate the results seen in Figures 7 and 8 is shown in Figures S1–S3.

Figure 7 Fourier-transformed EXAFS
of pristine 200 nm CuPc before and during
NO2 exposure.

Figure 8 Fourier-transformed EXAFS of pristine 200 nm CuPc before and during
NH3 exposure.

The XAS measurement results shown here indicate that the
interaction
between CuPc and the gas (NO2 or NH3) does not
occur at the Cu metal center but on the macrocycle instead. A first
indication is seen in the similar intensity of peak A in the first
derivative of XANES (Figure 6) in all three spectra because of low distortion from axial
ligands or even the lack of it. Furthermore, the coordination of NO2 onto the axial position of CuPc should theoretically result
in a Cu–NO2 or Cu–ONO bond, that is, 0.01–0.04
Å longer than Cu–N bond.51 On
the other hand, by referencing from the study done using ZnPc with
analytes such as NH3,52 an elongation
of the Cu–N(Pc macrocycle) bond can be expected from the interaction
of the gas on the metal center. ZnPc and CuPc have comparable frontier
orbitals and are thus suitable as a point of reference here. In view
that there is a lack of such Cu–N elongation in our results,
which can be seen by a right shift in EXAFS, or an additional shoulder
peak on the Cu–N peak, this suggests that there is a lack of
axial coordination of NO2 or NH3 on the metal
center.

On the other hand, the shortening of Cu–N bond
upon exposure
to NO2, as presented in EXAFS (Figure 7 and repeated in Figures S1 and S2), could be because of the interaction of CuPc with
NO2 on the macrocycle, in particular, on the pyrrole moiety.
In the interaction on the pyrrole moiety of CuPc, the Cu–N
bond is compressed so as to accommodate the NO2 gas molecule,
as shown in Figure 9. This proposition of interaction at the Pc macrocycle can be supported
by looking at the molecular orbitals of CuPc and NO2, where
the electron transfers from CuPc HOMO, which is a1u π
orbital of Pc macrocycle to 4a1 π orbital of NO2.32,42 It should be noted that it may be possible
for additional interaction between these π orbitals, given that
the CuPc LUMO and HOMO of NO2– are of
π character.42,53

Figure 9 Illustration of (a) CuPc molecule and
(b) subsequent Cu–N
bond shortening in CuPc molecule upon interaction with one NO2 molecule. Drawn using Avogadro.54

For the interaction of CuPc with
NH3, based on the first
derivative of XANES, it is also proposed to be on the Pc macrocycle.
This is substantiated by looking into the molecular orbital of CuPc
and NH3. Here, the electron transfers from NH3 nonbonding π orbital to CuPc LUMO of π Pc macrocycle
orbital.55,56 However, in contrast to the interaction
of CuPc with NO2, the interaction of CuPc with NH3 is proposed to be either on the benzo moiety or bridging atom because
of the lack of obvious shift in Cu–N bond in both experiments
(Figures 8, S1, and S3). It should be noted that our proposition
here contradicts works that support a metal center interaction,33 as well as π-back donation,52 which we do not expect of CuPc HOMO (πa1u) to LUMO of NH3 (σ*).55,56

On the basis of the in situ XAS measurements coupled with
frontier
molecular orbitals information, the interaction of CuPc with NO2 or NH3 has been reasonably justified to be on
the Pc macrocycle. This interaction thus leads to a slight deviation
of the CuPc square planar structure, which was reflected in the left
shift of the XANES spectra (Figure 5). The electron transfer from NH3 or additional
π-interaction between NO2 and CuPc may also contribute
to this left shift, which reflects as a decrease in the contribution
of Cu to the electron density of CuPc. For future work, it will be
interesting to investigate the gas interaction of CuPc by making in
situ N K-edge measurements, although there are challenges because
of the compromise of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition upon injection
of gas for in situ measurements. In particular, N K-edge will require
UHV conditions because of the low energies involved.

Conclusions
The gas sensitivity of CuPc to NO2 and NH3 was evaluated and showed an increase and decrease in the measured
current, respectively, upon gas exposure. The interaction site was
investigated using in situ XAS, an operando approach to investigate
the chemical environment of the neighboring atoms of the target Cu
metal center in this work.

Using XANES, a left shift in the
spectra upon gas exposure because
of a slight loss of centrosymmetricity of CuPc indicates the interaction
of the respective gases with CuPc. The first derivative of XANES also
suggests low or a lack of axial position coordination on the Cu metal
center. On the other hand, the interaction on the macrocycle is supported
by the EXAFS. For instance, from the EXAFS of CuPc with NO2, the presence of a left shift of the Cu–N peak, rather than
a right shift, indicates a compression of the Cu–N (Pc macrocycle)
and, subsequently, suggests that the interaction is at the pyrrole
moiety of the Pc macrocycle rather than on the metal center. The interaction
of NH3 with CuPc can be seen in the left shift of XANES,
and it is proposed that the interaction can be on the benzo moiety
or bridging atom because of the lack of obvious shifts in EXAFS. Our
proposition here is in tandem with the molecular orbital information
of CuPc, NO2, and NH3. In summary, interaction
sites for gas interaction analysis were demonstrated in this work
using CuPc with the oxidizing gas NO2 and reducing gas
NH3.
