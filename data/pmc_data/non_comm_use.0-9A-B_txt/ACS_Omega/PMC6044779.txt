Extradomain-B fibronectin (EDB-FN),
an oncofetal isoform of FN,
is a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target of tumors, including
breast cancer. Many EDB-FN-targeted drugs have been developed and
have shown therapeutic effects in clinical trials. Molecular imaging
to visualize EDB-FN-positive cancers may help select the right patients
who will be benefit from EDB-FN-targeted therapy. Although a few EDB-FN-targeted
imaging probes have been developed, the complicated manufacturing
procedure and expensive material and equipment required limit their
application for large-scale screening of EDB-FN-positive cancer patients.
Thus, more simple and economic EDB-FN-targeted imaging probes are
still urgently needed. Previously, we have identified a breast cancer-targeted
peptide, CTVRTSADC. Coincidently, it was later identified as an EDB-FN-targeted
peptide and named ZD2. In this study, we found a positive correlation
between the binding activity of the ZD2 phage and the expression level
of EDB-FN in breast cancer cells. Moreover, we observed the colocalization
of the ZD2 peptide with EDB-FN in breast cancer cells. Furthermore,
in vivo tumor targeting of the ZD2 phage, near-infrared fluorescence
imaging, and flow cytometry showed tumor-specific homing of the ZD2
peptide in mice bearing EDB-FN-positive breast cancers. Importantly,
on the basis of this EDB-FN-targeted ZD2 peptide, we developed a kit-formulated
probe, 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2, for single-photon-emission computed
tomography (SPECT) imaging of breast cancer. The high tumor uptake
of 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 demonstrated its feasibility for use
in visualizing EDB-FN-positive breast cancers in vivo. This kit-formulated
EDB-FN-targeted SPECT probe has potential clinical applications for
precision screening of EDB-FN-positive cancer patients who may benefit
from EDB-FN-targeted therapy.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the
most common malignant cancer among women and
the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.1 Early diagnosis is the key to successful treatment of breast
cancer.2 X-ray-based mammography, a simple
and economic imaging modality, has been shown to improve the early
diagnosis rate of breast cancer.2 Other anatomy-based
imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography,
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are clinical diagnostic techniques
that are routinely used for the diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic
response assessments of breast cancer.3 Although these traditional imaging techniques can provide important
anatomical imaging information on breast cancer, they are limited
in real-time monitoring of tumor functional molecular processes. Molecular
imaging modalities based on special functional imaging probes are
playing a major role in the era of precision medicine, as they can
provide functional molecular imaging information for real-time monitoring
of tumor progression at a molecular level.4,5 Currently,
single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission
tomography (PET) are the major clinically available molecular imaging
modalities. Tumor-targeted peptides can readily be radiolabeled with
radionuclides such as 99mTc for SPECT and 18F for PET.6

Fibronectin (FN) is
an abundant glycoprotein in the extracellular
matrix of connective tissues.7 FN regulates
cell adhesion, migration, growth, proliferation, and wound healing
during normal tissue development and tissue repair.7 There are three different FN isoforms generated by alternative
splicing of premessenger RNA: extradomain-A (EDA), extradomain-B (EDB),
and type III homology-connecting segment.8 The EDA-FN and EDB-FN isoforms sometimes referred to as oncofetal
isoforms, as they are typically expressed during embryonic development
but re-expressed during tumor development.9 Functionally, they are involved in tumorigenesis,10 angiogenesis,11 and metastasis;12 thus, they are promising diagnostic and therapeutic
tumor targets.10 EDB-FN-specific antibodies and peptides that
mediate delivery of cytokines, cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic
drugs, and radioisotopes have been developed.13−19 Some are being examined in clinical trials and exert therapeutic
effects in EDB-FN-positive cancer patients. With the help of EDB-FN-targeted
molecular imaging, doctors can select suitable cancer patients for
these EDB-FN-targeted therapy.8 Several EDB-FN-targeted imaging
probes have been developed;8 however, most
of them are still far from clinical application because they involve
complicated manufacturing process and expensive materials and equipment.
Thus, more simple and economic EDB-FN-targeted imaging probes are
urgently needed.

Previously, we have identified several breast
cancer-targeted peptides
through phage-display peptide library screening against breast cancer
MDA-MB-231 cells.20 The neuroplin-1-targeted
peptide CLKADKAKC (CK3) was translated into near-infrared fluorescence
(NIRF) imaging and SPECT imaging probes for the diagnosis of breast
cancer.20 Here, we focus on another breast
cancer-targeted peptide, CTVRTSADC, which was later identified as
an EDB-FN-targeted peptide named ZD2 by Lu et al.21 They labeled this EDB-FN-targeted ZD2 peptide with the
NIRF dye Cy5 to form an NIRF imaging probe, Cy5-ZD2, for NIRF imaging
of prostate cancer.21 However, due to its
poor tissue penetration, immature instrument,
and high autofluorescence background, the NIRF imaging modality is
not routinely used clinically. Here, we developed a more clinically
applicable, simple, economic, and kit-formulated SPECT probe, 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2. Compared with other developed EDB-FN-targeted
imaging probes, this SPECT probe is more suitable for large-scale
screening of EDB-FN-positive breast cancer patients, who may benefit
from EDB-FN-targeted therapy.

Results
Identification of ZD2
Previously, we have identified
12 breast cancer-targeted peptides by screening the Ph.D.-CX7C peptide
phage-display library against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. To identify
more breast cancer-targeted peptides,
here, we randomly picked, purified, and examined 60 individual phages
enriched with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) (Figure S1). Fifty-four phage
clones with a higher binding activity as compared to that of the control
phage were identified and selected for DNA sequencing. This approach
has identified another dominant peptide, CTVRTSADC (5 of 54 positive
clones). Interestingly, this peptide has also been identified by us in our previous study20 and later by Lu et al.21 as
being an EDB-FN-targeted peptide named ZD2. Here, we synthesized three
ZD2-based peptides, including biotin-ZD2, Cy5-ZD2, and HYNIC-ZD2,
for subsequent studies (Figure 1).

In Vitro ZD2 Specificity
Before the application of
this peptide for the imaging of breast cancer in vivo, we used real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to examine the messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression levels of EDB-FN in nine different breast cancer cells,
including MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-415, MCF-7, BT-549, HCC1937,
SK-BR-3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 cells (Figure S2). Three representative breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7
(low EDB-FN expression), MDA-MB-231 (intermediate EDB-FN expression),
and MDA-MB-468 (high EDB-FN expression) (Figure 2A), were selected for further study. To link
the expression level of EDB-FN to the binding activity of ZD2 phage,
we examined the binding activity of the ZD2 phage in three selected
breast cancer cells, as mentioned above. Consistent with the expression
levels of EDB-FN in these cells, the binding activity of the ZD2 phage
was low in MCF-7 cells, moderate in MDA-MB-231 cells, and high in
MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 2B). Linear regression analysis showed that there was a positive
correlation between the binding activity of the ZD2 phage and the
expression level of EDB-FN in these cells (Figure 2C). Moreover, we observed that the biotin-labeled
ZD2 peptide biotin-ZD2 colocalized with EDB-FN in MDA-MB-468 cells
(Figure 2D) but not
in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Thus, the ZD2 peptide binds to EDB-FN-positive
breast cancer cells in vitro.

cancer cells. (A) Relative

cancer cells, examined by RT-PCR. The expression level of EDB-FN in
MCF-7 cells was used as the control. (B) Binding of the ZD2 phage
to MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells. Wild-type M13 phage without

of MDA-MB-468 cells incubated with the biotin-labeled ZD2 peptide.
The Pearson correlation coefficient was about 0.65.

In Vivo Tumor Homing of ZD2
To determine
whether the
ZD2 peptide can specifically home to breast cancer tissues in vivo,
we injected MDA-MB-468 cells under the mammary fat pad to form EDB-FN-positive
breast cancer mice models. First, we examined whether the ZD2 phage
would home to tumors in vivo. ZD2 phages were intravenously injected
into mice bearing MDA-MB-468 tumors. The uptake of the ZD2 phage in
different organs and tumor tissues was examined. There was more accumulation
of the ZD2 phage in tumor tissues as compared to that of the control
phage (Figure S3). We also observed that
predominant phage uptake occurred in organs of the mononuclear phagocyte
system, including the liver and spleen, but there were no significant
differences between the accumulation of the ZD2 phage and control
phage in these organs (data no shown).

We then labeled the ZD2
peptide with the NIRF dye Cy5 to form the NIRF imaging probe Cy5-ZD2,
which was intravenously injected into mice bearing MDA-MB-468 tumors
under the mammary fat pad. The Cy5-CG7C peptide, without any
organ and tissue accumulation except in the kidney for excretion,
was used as a negative control. Whole-body NIRF imaging showed that
the intravenously injected Cy5-ZD2 peptide but not the control Cy5-CG7C
peptide specifically homed to tumors (Figure 3A). NIRF imaging of the collected organs
and tumors further demonstrated specific accumulation of the Cy5-ZD2
peptide into tumors but not into other organs (Figure 3B). Confocal imaging of the tumor tissues
showed that the Cy5-ZD2 peptide but not the control Cy5-CG7C peptide
specifically accumulated into tumors (Figure 3C). Additionally, we found that the Cy5-ZD2
peptide colocalized with EDB-FN in tumor tissues (Figure S4). Quantification of the collected organs and tumors
indicated that the radiant efficiency produced by Cy5-ZD2 was about
15-fold over that by control Cy5-CG7C (Figure 3D).

Figure 3 Tumor-specific homing of Cy5-ZD2 in mice bearing
MDA-MB-468 tumors.
(A) NIRF imaging showed in vivo tumor homing of Cy5-labeled ZD2 (Cy5-ZD2).
Approximately 200 μg of Cy5-ZD2 or the Cy5-labeled control peptide
CG7C (Cy5-CG7C) was intravenously injected into mice bearing MDA-MB-468
tumors and allowed to circulate for 48 h before imaging. (B) Tumors
and organs were collected and imaged 48 h post injection of the Cy5-labeled
peptides. (C) Imaging of the tumor accumulation of Cy5-ZD2. (D) Quantification
of Cy5-ZD2 and Cy5-CG7C peptides in tumors and organs using Living
Image software. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test. n = 3; error bars, SD; ***p < 0.001.

Finally, the collected organs and tumors were further homogenized
and analyzed by flow cytometry. Consistent with previous results,
the accumulation of Cy5-ZD2 into tumor tissues was more than that
of Cy5-CG7C (Figure 4). These findings indicate that the ZD2 peptide specifically homes
to EDB-FN-positive breast cancer in vivo.

and control Cy5-CG7C in organs and tumor
analyzed by flow cytometry. Note that the accumulation of Cy5-ZD2
into tumors was more than that of Cy5-CG7C.

SPECT Imaging of Breast Cancer with 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2
According to previous studies, an HYNIC-modified peptide can be
easily radiolabeled with 99mTc to form a SPECT probe 99mTc-HYNIC-peptide.6 Referring
to previous studies by Guggenberg et al., all radiolabeling processes
would form a read-to-use kit, and the final radiolabeled products
can be purified on a mini column.22 Importantly,
all materials and equipment required
are simple and affordable. Thus, we developed a kit-formulated EDB-FN-targeted
SPECT probe. 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 (Figure 5A), for the large -scale of screening EDB-FN-positive
breast cancer patients who may benefit from EDB-FN-targeted therapy. 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 was first examined by radio-high-performance
liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC) for radiolabeling yield measurement
(Figure S5) and then was intravenously
injected into mice that had EDB-FN-positive MDA-MB-468 breast cancer
under the mammary fat pad (Figure 5B). SPECT imaging showed that 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2
accumulated in the tumor and kidney 2 h post intravenous injection.
(Figure 5C,D). The
biodistribution of 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 showed that 99mTc-labeled ZD2 accumulated in the tumors and kidneys for excretion
1, 2, and 3 h after intravenous injection (Table 1). Note that there was still relatively high accumulation of 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2
in the lung except kidney (Table 1). The reason behind 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 having
a relatively high lung accumulation is deserved to be further researched
in the future. Our present findings demonstrate that 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 is applicable for SPECT imaging of EDB-FN-positive breast
cancer.

Discussion
EDB-FN is overexpressed in many tumors, including but not limited
to breast cancer,23−25 liver cancer,26 lung cancer,27 colorectal cancer,28 head and neck cancer,29 lymphoma,30,31 glioma,32 and melanoma.33 Kaczmarek et al. used the EDN-FN antibody BC-1 to perform
immunohistochemical analysis in normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic
human breast tissues.23 They found that
90 of 97 (93%) patients with invasive ductal carcinomas and 10 of
14 (71.4%) patients with invasive lobular carcinoma reacted positively
to the EDN-FN antibody BC-1.23 Matsumoto
et al. analyzed human breast cancer tissues by in situ hybridization
using probes specific to the EDN-FN alternative splicing site.24 They observed that 33% of the invasive ductal
carcinomas demonstrated EDB-FN-positive mRNA signals.24 D’Ovidio et al. found that EDB-FN staining was significantly
more in the stroma of poorly differentiated and metastatic breast
cancer tissues, although it was not correlated with the progression
of tumor vascularization.25 All of these
researches suggest diagnostic and therapeutic significance of EDB-FN
in breast cancer.

EDB-FN-specific antibodies have been explored
for the molecular
imaging of EDB-FN in tumors. Monica et al. explored a radiolabeled
EDB-FN antibody, 123I-L19(scFv)2, for immunoscintigraphic
imaging of 20 patients diagnosed with colorectal, lung, and brain cancers.34 They observed that 16 of 20
patients had different levels of antibody accumulation either in the
primary tumors or metastases.34 Poli et
al. used 124I-labeled L19SIP in immunoPET to predict the
doses delivered to tumor lesions and healthy organs by subsequent 131I-labeled L19SIP radioimmunotherapy in patients with brain
metastases from solid tumors.35 They showed
that ImmunoPET with 124I-labeled L19SIP offered an advantage
over conventional 131I imaging, that is, accuracy of dosimetric
results from the treatment with radretumab.35 Dietmar et al. radiolabeled 99mTc with three L19 derivatives for imaging
of tumor angiogenesis. They found that 99mTc-AP39 showed
the most favorable biodistribution and tumor-imaging properties.36 Compared with these EDB-FN antibody L19-based
imaging approaches, those involving the use of the ZD2 peptide as
an EDB-FN-targeted imaging vehicle may offer several advantages, including
low immunogenicity, easy synthesis, enhanced tissue penetration, ready
diffusion, and simple radiolabeling. Moreover, compared with those
of 123I and 124I, the optimal nuclear properties
and ease of availability at a low cost of 99mTc make this
radionuclide more suitable for the formation of SPECT imaging probes.

Kim et al. have identified several EDB-FN-specific aptides using
their designed aptide libraries.37 They
conjugated these EDB-FN specific aptides with superparamagnetic iron
oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to form APTEDB–SPIONs
for MRI of Lewis lung carcinoma.38 In the
following study, they continued to developed other nanoparticles APTEDB–TCL–SPION for MRI of breast tumor-initiating
cells.39 These studies demonstrate that
these contrast-enhanced MRI agents have the potential to enable the
visualization of EDB-FN-positive cancers. Unfortunately, MRI in molecular
imaging is limited by its relatively low sensitivity. Moreover, the
complicated formation of SPIONs, the cost of the materials, and the
time-consuming examining process may limit the use of MRI for the
large-scale screening of EDB-FN-positive cancer patients.

EDB-FN-targeted
peptides have been identified and explored for
MRI of EDB-FN-positive tumors. Using phage-display technology,40 Pilch et al. identified two FN–fibrin
complex-specific cyclic peptides, CGLIIQKNEC (CLT1) and CNAGESSKNC
(CLT2). Following study, Lu et al. translated the CLT1 peptide into
MRI contrast agents.41 They also identified
a novel EDB-FN-targeted peptide, CTVRTSADC (ZD2), which was translated
into the NIRF imaging agent Cy5-ZD2 for prostate cancer.21 They labeled this EDB-FN-targeted ZD2 peptide
with the NIRF dye Cy5 to form a NIRF imaging probe, Cy5-ZD2, for NIRF
imaging of prostate cancer.21 Coincidently,
in a previous study, we have reported this ZD2 peptide as being a
breast cancer-targeted peptide.20

Although several EDB-FN-targeted imaging probes have been developed,
their complicated manufacture, expensive materials and equipment required,
time-consuming detection procedure, and low sensitivity may limit
their clinical application for large-scale of screening of potential
cancer patients who may benefit from EDB-FN-targeted therapy. Thus,
to develop more clinically applicable, simple, and economic imaging
probes, here, we developed a kit-formulated SPECT probe, 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2. This novel probe has excellent targeting properties,
fast clearance, and a high tumor-to-organ ratio, suggesting its potential
future application for the screening of breast cancer and other cancers
with EDB-FN overexpression. Compared with other developed EDB-FN-targeted
imaging probes, this probe has several advantages, including ease
of mass production, simple radiolabeling procedure, ease of availability
for routine clinical use, and low cost. However, it is noteworthy
that 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 has a relative high accumulation in
the lungs, which may limit its future application for the detection
of tumors with lung metastasis.

Conclusions
In
this study, we showed that the ZD2 peptide specifically bound
to EDB-FN-positive breast cancer cell lines in vitro and homed to
EDB-FN-positive breast cancer in vivo. On the basis of this EDB-FN-targeted
peptide, we developed a more clinically applicable, simple, economic,
and kit-formulated probe for SPECT imaging of breast cancer. The high
tumor uptake of this probe in mice bearing EDB-FN-positive breast
cancers suggests its feasibility of application in the SPECT imaging
of EDB-FN-positive breast cancer and other cancers with EDB-FN overexpression.

dihydrochloride (DAPI), streptavidin-Cy3, ethylenediammonium diacetate
(EDDA), tricine, mannitol, and SnCl2·2H2O, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 99mTcO4– was obtained from HTA Co., Ltd.,
China.

Cell Lines
MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-415, MCF-7,
BT-549, HCC1937, SK-BR-3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA)
and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.

Mice
We conducted animal experiments according to the
institutional guidelines of the Guangdong Province. All experiments
were approved by the Use Committee for Animal Care. To create breast cancer mice models, 2
× 106 MDA-MB-468 cells were injected into the mammary
fat pad of each NOD/SCID mouse.

Peptide Synthesis and Labeling
Biotin-CTVRTSADC, biotin-CG7C,
Cy5-CTVRTSADC, Cy5-CG7C, and HYNIC-CTVRTSADC were synthesized at the
Chinese Peptide Company (Hangzhou, China) using standard solid-phase
Fmoc chemistry. The peptides were purified to a minimum purity of
95% by HPLC. The peptides were isolated by lyophilization.

ELISA
ELISA was performed as previously described.20 Briefly, MDA-MB231 cells were plated in 96-well
plates 24 h before ELISA. The wells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) three times and fixed with 0.25% glutaral. Then, 3% hydrogen
peroxide and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) were added to the wells
to inhibit the endogenous peroxidase activity and block nonspecific
binding, respectively. About 109 transducing units of phages
were added and incubated for 2 h. After washing with 0.05% Tris-buffered
saline with Tween 20 (TBST) three times, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-M13 monoclonal antibodies (1:5000) were added, and the cells
were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Tetramethylbenzidine was added
for 30 min after finally washing with 0.05% TBST three times. The
reaction was stopped by added 2 M H2SO4, and
the absorbance was recorded against that of the blank at 450 nm with
an ELISA plate reader.

Immunofluorescence
MDA-MB-468 and
MCF-7 cells were
plated on coverslips in 24-well culture plates. The wells were incubated
with 50 mM biotin-CTVRTSADC (ZD2) or biotin-CG7C at 37 °C for
2 h. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, blocked with 2% BSA for 30 min, and
incubated with antifibronectin monoclonal antibody (BC-1; ab154210)
(1:500) for 2 h. After washing with PBS three times, anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 488 (1:1000) and streptavidin-Cy3 (1:3000) were added and the
cells were incubated for 1 h. The nuclei were stained with DAPI after
three more washes. For the staining of the tumor tissues, the sections
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, blocked with 2% BSA
for 30 min, and then incubated with antifibronectin monoclonal antibodies
(BC-1; ab154210) (1:500) for 12 h. After washing with PBS three times,
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000) was added and the sections were
incubated for 1 h. The nuclei were stained with DAPI after three more
washes. Confocal images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning
system and FluoView application software FV10-ASW 3.0 (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).

In Vitro Cellular Binding and in Vivo Tumor Targeting of the
ZD2 Phage
In vitro cellular binding of the ZD2 and control
phages was performed as previously described.20 For in vivo tumor targeting of the ZD2 and control phages, about
109 transducing units of the ZD2 or control phage in 200
μL of DMEM were injected intravenously into mice bearing MDA-MB-468
tumors. The phages were allowed to circulate for 10 min, and the mice
were perfused through the heart with 20 mL of DMEM. The organs and
tumor were collected, weighed, and homogenized. The homogenates were
washed three times with DMEM containing a protein inhibitor cocktail
and PMSF. The organ- and tumor-binding phages were recovered and infected
with ER2738 bacteria. The mixture was diluted and plated on agar plates.

NIRF Imaging
NIRF optical imaging was performed using
the IVIS Spectrum (Xenogen Corporation, Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton,
MA). The data were analyzed using Living Image version 3.0 (Caliper
Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). The NIRF activity in different organs
was quantified on the basis of the following procedures: a region
of interest was defined, NIRF measurements were carried out, and the
measures were expressed as efficiency using the Living Image software.

Flow Cytometry
To compare the uptake efficiencies of
the Cy5-labeled peptides by the cells in the tumor tissues and normal
organs, the tumor tissues and normal organs (e.g., heart, liver, spleen,
lung, kidney, brain, tumor tissues) were collected and dispersed into
single-cell suspensions with a homogenizer. The cell suspensions were
analyzed by flow cytometry. The total number of gated cells (1 ×
106) was measured in each tissue.

Kit Formulation
Kit formulation was performed as previously
described.22 Briefly, we dissolved EDDA
in water with gently heating (20 mg/mL) and tricine/mannitol in water
(40 mg/mL tricine, 100 mg/mL mannitol). A 24 mL stock solution (10
mg/mL EDDA, 20 mg/mL tricine, 50 mg/mL mannitol) was prepared by mixing
12 mL of EDDA and 12 mL of tricine/mannitol solution and purged with
nitrogen in a rubber-sealed vial for 15 min. Before use, we dissolved
HYNIC-ZD2 in water (500 μg/mL) and SnCl2·2H2O in nitrogen-purged 0.1 N HCl (1 mg/mL). The final solution
contains 1 mL of EDDA/tricine/mannitol (10 mg of EDDA, 20 mg of tricine,
50 mg of mannitol), 0.04 mL of HYNIC-ZD2 (20 μg), and 0.04 mL
of SnCl2·2H2O (40 μg) in sterile
glass vials. The vials were lyophilized with a freeze dryer (AdVantage
2.0; SP Scientific), capped under vacuum, and stored at 4 °C.

Preparation of 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 and SPECT Imaging
Before radiolabeling, a Sep-Pak Light C18 Cartridge (Waters, Milford,
MA) was conditioned with 5 mL of 95% ethanol and equilibrated with
5 mL of saline. First, we added 1 mL of 0.2 M Na2HPO4 to the kit formulation vial; then, Na99mTcO4 (20–25 mCi) generator eluate, saline to a final volume
of 2 mL. The vial was incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min
and cooled at room temperature for another 10 min. The solution in
the vial was loaded onto the
prepared C18 Cartridge, which was washed with 5 mL of saline to remove
hydrophilic impurities. Finally, 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 was eluted
with 0.5 mL of 95% ethanol. The sample was examined by radio-HPLC
for radiolabeling yield measurement and diluted with saline and intravenously
injected into NOD/SCID mice bearing MDA-MB-468 tumors. Each tumor-bearing
mouse was imaged at 2 h post injection.

Biodistribution of 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2
The biodistribution
of 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 was performed as previously described.42 Mice were first anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
at a dose of 50.0 mg/kg and then sacrificed by cervical dislocation
at 1, 2, and 3 h post injection. The organs of interest were collected,
weighed, and measured for radioactivity in a γ-counter. The
percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue mass (%ID/g) was calculated
to indicate organ uptake. The organ uptake data and tumor-to-organ
ratio were calculated on the basis of results from three mice at each
time point.

SPECT Imaging
SPECT imaging of 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2
was performed as previously described.42 Briefly, the imaging study was performed using female NOD/SCID mice
bearing MDA-MB-468 xenografts. Sodium pentobarbital at a dose of 50.0
mg/kg was first intraperitoneally injected to anesthetize mice, and
then, 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 (∼400 μCi) in 0.2 mL
of saline was intravenously injected and allowed to circulate 2 h
post injection. SPECT images were acquired using a two-head γ-camera
with a parallel-hole, low-energy, and high-resolution.

Data Analysis
and Statistics
Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS Statistics 13.0 (SPSS Inc.). The data were analyzed
using Student’s t-test and linear regression.
