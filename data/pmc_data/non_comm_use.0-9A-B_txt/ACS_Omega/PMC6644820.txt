Mononuclear lanthanide-based single-ion
magnets (SIMs) are known
since 2003 with the discovery of SIM properties in a bis-(phthalocyaninato)lanthanide
complex. A recent report on [Dy(Cpttt)2][BC6F5] indicating that it exhibits the highest known
blocking temperature (60 K) has spurred fresh interest in this area.
In this article, we discuss about the various requirements of lanthanide-based
SIMs along with representative examples. Specifically, we describe
the complexes whose coordination numbers vary from 2 to 8. We also
discuss the representative examples of organometallic lanthanide complexes
that can function as molecular magnets.

1 Introduction
The discovery of single-molecule magnetism in the dodecanuclear
mixed-valent (MnIV/MnIII) complex, [MnIII8MnIV4O12(O2CMe)16(H2O)4] (hereafter Mn12Ac) (1),1 heralded
the birth of an interdisciplinary field involving the study of molecular
magnets.2 Such systems have attracted the
attention of chemists, physicists, and materials scientists for several
reasons. These include the challenges involved in their design and
syntheses, understanding their physics, and harnessing their applications
in many new technologically relevant areas.3 The latter include high-energy density storage,4 molecular spintronics,4b,4c,5 quantum computation,4a,4d,6 molecular refrigeration,7 and so forth.

Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are characterized
by an energy barrier, Ueff, which has
to be overcome for spin reversal.
Several mechanisms for the relaxation of the magnetization of SMMs
are now known; these are discussed briefly vide infra. Another important
parameter that can attest to the quality of an SMM is the so-called
blocking temperature, TB, below which
the magnetization of the system is blocked, allowing it to function
as an SMM. Although the value of TB depends
on the manner in which the experiment is carried out (the frequency
of measurement in an ac susceptibility experiment or the rate of sweep
of magnetic field in an M vs H experiment),
it is still a useful parameter for comparing various SMMs.8 The highest TB (60
K) observed till date is for the complex, [Dy(Cpttt)2][BC6F5] (Cpttt = C5H2tBu3-1,2,4) (2).9

The field of SMMs was
initially dominated by polynuclear transition
metal clusters not only because of the inspiration of Mn12Ac but also because of the understanding gained in the subject that
the Ueff for such SMMs qualitatively equals
|D|(S2 – 1/4)
for half-integer spins and |D|S2 for integer spins [D = zero-field splitting
parameter related to the Ising-type magnetic anisotropy of the system; S = total spin of the system].8 After a flurry of activity involving several polynuclear transition-metal
complexes, it was soon realized that a linear increase of S does not lead to an increase in Ueff and that the factors that would enable the enhancement
of magnetic anisotropy are more important.10 This realization was also coincident with the discovery that lanthanide-based
mononuclear complexes (Bu4N)[LnIIIPc2] [Ln = Tb (3), Dy (4); Pc = phthalocyaninato]
were SMMs.11 This report slowly shifted
the focus of research from polynuclear complexes to mononuclear complexes
as systems suitable for the SMM behavior. Such systems are also now
known as single-ion magnets (SIMs). Although both transition-metal12 and lanthanide13/actinide13g,13h,14 SIMs are now known, this review
will focus on lanthanide-based SIMs. Most lanthanide ions except LaIII, GdIII, and LuIII show a strong spin–orbit
coupling (SOC) because of the large unquenched orbital angular momentum.
Because of this, in lanthanide complexes, LnIII ions show
a larger SOC energy (ΔE = 104 to
103 cm–1) in comparison to the crystal
field (CF) splitting (ΔE = 103 to
102 cm–1). The reverse is true for the
3d metal-ion complexes where the CF splitting is found to be significantly
larger compared to SOC (ΔE = 103 cm–1 and ΔE = 10 cm–1, respectively).15 On the
basis of the current understanding, the key factors needed to maximize Ueff in the lanthanide-based SMMs and SIMs can
be summarized as follows: (i) the ground ±mJ states should be degenerate with the highest mJ value (as expected for Kramers ions, to achieve magnetic
bistability),16 (ii) the energy barrier
between the ground and excited mJ states
should be large, (iii) the mJ states should
be pure to maintain strong axiality to avoid the quantum tunneling
mechanism (QTM) of magnetic relaxation. Achieving strong axiality
can be approached by minimizing transverse anisotropy, dipolar interactions,
hyperfine effects, vibronic couplings, and so forth.13k The other way to maximize the Ueff value is to employ radical-based ligand(s) to increase the exchange
coupling between two lanthanide ions.17 This has been well-established by Long and co-workers for a N23– radical-bridged dinuclear complex [K(crypt-222)][(Cp4MeH2Tb)2(μ-N2•)] (Cp4MeH = tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)
(5) that exhibits two energy barriers: Ueff1 = 397 K; Ueff2 = 811
K and a TB of up to 20 K along with the
extremely high coercive field of Hc =
7.9 T at 10 K.17e

As mentioned above,
this article deals with the lanthanide (III)-based
SIMs where the complexes contain only one LnIII ion. This
review will deal with representative examples that illustrate the
subject. For an exhaustive treatment, the reader is referred to a
recent review published by some of us.13a Some important reviews in the general subject of lanthanide(III)-based
SMMs are also listed.13

Before considering
the subject matter, we feel that a few aspects
relating to SMMs should be indicated. These are dealt in the following
sections.

2 Relaxation Mechanisms in SMMs
Relaxation
of magnetization in SMMs is extremely important. Understanding
the mechanisms of relaxation allows the design of systems where the
magnetization can be blocked for longer periods of time. Figure 1 summarizes the possible
relaxation pathways.19 If the relaxation
of magnetization is via a thermal process (i.e., by crossing over
the highest excited state), the relaxation dynamics follows the Arrhenius
law  

Figure 1 Possible relaxation pathways in SMMs. An ideal SMM corresponds
to the suppression of all relaxation mechanisms except the ones shown
by blue arrows.18 Reprinted with permission

However, as multiple mechanisms are usually involved, the
overall
relaxation pathways can be put together as  

Here, the parameters A, B, C, and τ0 are constants
and correspond
to four different relaxation processes (QTM, Direct, Raman, and Orbach),
respectively, that contribute simultaneously to the relaxation rate
τ–1; H represents the applied
field; T is the temperature; n1 = 4 and 2 for Kramers and non-Kramers doublets, respectively;
and n2 = 7 and 9 for the non-Kramers ions
and Kramers ions, respectively. However, n2 may vary depending on the exact energies of the ground doublets,
and, thus, the value is reasonable for n2 ≥ 4. Ueff is generally considered
as the energy gap to be overcome for relaxation to occur.

The
three relaxation processes (Figure S1)
(QTM, Direct, and Raman) will shortcut the Orbach process at a
given temperature, especially in the low-temperature region, and greatly
reduce the energy barrier. To extend the efficiency of an SMM, these
three processes, especially QTM, should be suppressed as efficiently
as possible. This can be achieved (a) by modulating the ligand field
to enhance the axial anisotropy and/or by maintaining a higher symmetry
(to prevent the mixing of wave functions and to force the relaxation
via the higher excited states); (b) by applying a dc magnetic field
(to remove the ground-state degeneracy of the ±mJ states); and (c) by magnetic dilution (to remove the dipolar interactions between the
paramagnetic spin centers in the lattice and hyperfine interactions
with the nuclear spin). A judicious choice of Kramers ions (4f ions
with half-integer J) is also an alternative strategy
to reduce QTM. As the latter is due to the presence of transverse
anisotropy that allows the magnetization to tunnel between the superposed
doublets, reduction of the transverse anisotropy can contribute to
minimizing QTM.

3 Factors Influencing SMM Performance
In 4f complexes, the CF effect and SOC [though SOC (∼104 cm–1) is significantly larger than CF (∼102 cm–1)] are the two important factors in
magnetization relaxation dynamics. The CF effect can be considered
as a perturbation on SOC and as a primary source of splitting of the mJ states in 4f complexes. It is assumed that
to achieve the magnetic bistability, the highest ±mJ values should have the lowest energy, and the energy
gap between the ground ±mJ state
and the first excited ±mJ state should
be as high as possible. Long proposed a qualitative electrostatic
model that predicts a maximization of the single-ion anisotropy of
4f ions with distinct electron density distributions on the basis
of the interaction between the single-ion electron density and the
CF environment.13k According to this proposal,
the oblate ions, Ce(III), Pr(III), Nd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), and
Ho(III), having a strong axial CF below and above the xy basal plane, stabilize the largest mJ and maximize the uniaxial anisotropy. However, the prolate ions,
Pm(III), Sm(III), Er(III), Tm(III), and Yb(III), favor the equatorial
coordination geometry to minimize the charge repulsion with the axial
electron density (Figure S2).

It
is important to mention in this context that the shape of the
electron density of 4f ions in any condition is strongly dependent
on the nature of the ground mJ state.
For example, a TbIII ion with mJ = ±6 ground state maintains an extremely oblate electron density,
whereas mJ = ±5, ±4, ±3,
±2, ±1, and 0 states all have prolate electron densities
(Figure S3).

Examples where this
proposal has been tested include the C3-symmetric complexes, Ln[N(SiMe3)2]3 [Ln = DyIII (6) and ErIII (7)] (Figure 2).20 In this series,
the ErIII analogue shows the signature of an SMM with Ueff = 122 K (85 cm–1) and
τ0 = 9.33 × 10–9 s, whereas
expectedly the DyIII derivative is not an SMM. ErIII, a prolate ion, favors an equatorial coordination, maximizing the
uniaxial anisotropy to stabilize the highest mJ = ±15/2 ground state (Figure 3).

After considering the nature of the lanthanide ion (prolate
or
oblate), let us examine the influence of the local point group symmetry
of the complex in maximizing the axial/transverse anisotropy. For
4f ions, the CF Hamiltonian can be described by the following equation  where Bkq represents the CF parameters, Okq is the Stephen
operator, k is the order of the Stevens operator,
and q is the operator range that varies between k and −k. When k = 0, B0q are the axial parameters; conversely, B0q are the transverse parameters when k ≠ 0 (q = 2, 4, 6), which results
in a fast QTM process with reduced relaxation times. The unwanted
QTM can be efficiently suppressed with Bkq = 0 (k ≠ 0, q = 2, 4, 6) in some highly symmetric
geometries such as C∞v, D4d, S8, D5h, D6d, and D∞h, and so forth.18,21

We will try to illustrate the influence of the local point
group
symmetry by considering the eight-coordinated complexes. In eight
coordination, two specific geometries, viz., the square antiprism
(SAP) and the cube are considered. In the SAP geometry (Figure 4), dpp represents the distance between the L4 squares; din represents the shorter L–L distance within the
L4 square; Φ represents the angle between the diagonals of the
two squares (skew angle); and α represents the angle between
the S8 axis and the 4f–L direction.21a,21b

angular parameters in SAP geometry: Φ, the angle between the
diagonals of the two squares (skew angle); α, the angle between
the S8 axis and the LnIII ligand
direction. Reprinted with permission from ref (19a). Copyright 2015 Springer-Verlag,

For the highest symmetry SAP,
Φ is 45°, whereas α
corresponds to the magic angle, 54.74°. A wider value of α
(α > 54.74°) corresponds to compression, whereas a smaller
value (α < 54.74°) corresponds to elongation along the
tetragonal axis. The deviation of Φ from 45° results in
the distortion of the D4d symmetry with the appearance of nonzero B44 and B64 CF parameters.
As a result, in such a deviation from the D4d symmetry, QTM is favored because of the mixing of
functions with different mJ values. It
has also been proposed that in an ideal D4d symmetry, the ground state will possess the highest mJ values.21a

Let us now consider the cubic symmetry. In this case, the second-order
uniaxial anisotropy, B20, is
lacking, and hence cubic geometry is unfavorable for the complex to
exhibit a high Ueff.21b

Therefore, to summarize, to enhance the value of Ueff, a suitable ligand field that in turn generates
a
favorable CF is necessary to enlarge the separation between the bistable
ground state and the first excited state. An idealized example, the
[DyO]+ complex, with a perfect axiality (gz ≈ 20 and gx, gy ≈ 0) was proposed theoretically by Ungur and Chibotaru.
For this complex, all the Kramers doublets show perfect axiality up
to the highest mJ (except for mJ = ±1/2 states), with g⊥ = 0, leading to an extremely high energy barrier
of Ueff > 3000 K (Figure S4).22

4 Effect
of Coordination Numbers
The CF diagram analysis for the several
analogues of the [DyFn]3–n complexes
indicates that low coordination numbers in combination with uniaxial
symmetry (n = 2 leads to a linear F–Dy–F
complex) lead to the largest splitting. Moreover, the complexes with
cubic, octahedral, tetrahedral as well as icosahedral symmetry preserve
the isotropy along the three Cartesian axes; therefore, the separation
between the ground and excited states is exceedingly small, and hence
complexes possessing these symmetries are not expected to be good
SMMs (Figure 5). On
the other hand, complexes with axial symmetry like trigonal (D3h) and pentagonal bipyramid
(D5h) geometries can
have ground-state doublets with perfect axiality, and therefore such
complexes can be good candidates for SMMs18,22,23

Having considered the
various factors that can lead to good SMM
properties, we will now describe the representative examples of Ln(III)-containing
SIMs in various coordination numbers. We will confine our discussion,
first, on complexes with coordination numbers 2–8. This is
followed by a discussion on organometallic complexes.

5 Complexes with Low Coordination Numbers (2–5)
From Figure 5, it
can be seen that linear two-coordinated complexes possess intrinsically
uniaxial symmetry, and hence the energy difference between the ground
state and the first excited-state doublets will be the highest. However,
the preparation of stable linear LnIII complexes is synthetically
challenging unlike the two-coordinated mononuclear transition-metal
complexes.24 The recent report of a near-linear
SmII complex [(iPr3Si)2N–Sm–N(SiiPr3)2] (8) provides a possible
synthetic route for the preparation of analogous DyIII/TbIII complexes (Figure 6). A theoretical study (CASSCF/RASSI/SINGLE_ANISO ab initio)
on the DyIII analogue, [(Dy{N(SiiPr3)2}2])+, revealed
that it could have an energy barrier of Ueff ≈ 1800 cm–1. It was also predicted that
for this compound magnetic hysteresis can be achieved above the liquid
N2 temperature (77 K). However, this proposal does not
take into account the possible influence of counteranions (that may
affect the crystal packing) on the relaxation dynamics. This study
also suggests that the dianionic methanediide-based complexes, [(iPr3Si)2C–Dy–C(SiiPr3)2]−, could have a Ueff larger by a factor
of 1.2–1.3.25

To understand the correlation between the Ueff value and the bending angle (θ) in two-coordinated
near-linear systems, detailed theoretical calculations were carried
out on model two-coordinate DyIII complexes [DyL2]+ (L = N(SiH3)2 or C(SiH3)3 or CH(SiH3)2) with varying θ,
90 ≤ θ ≤ 180. It has been observed that Ueff does not vary a lot with the change of the
bending angle (θ) (Figure 7). In fact, it appears that a perfectly linear E–Dy–E
geometry with θ = 180 is probably not necessary to obtain a
large Ueff as long as a two-coordinated
DyIII complex is formed. On the other hand, it has been
shown that the Ueff value decreases by
50–70% upon coordination of solvent molecules like tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (Figure S5).26

On the basis of the CF diagram for the [DyFn]3–n complexes (Figure 5), it is clear that
complexes having an axial symmetry group like trigonal symmetry generally
maintain a strong axiality in the ground state as well as excited
state. Accordingly, as mentioned above, in the complexes [Ln{N(SiMe3)2}3] [Ln = Dy (6) and
Er (7)], with C3 symmetry,
where all Ln–N bonds are equal and <NLnN ≈ 120°,
the ErIII analogue shows an SMM behavior with Ueff = 122 K (85 cm–1) and τ0 = 9.33 × 10–9 s at zero dc field.
Note that, on the other hand, the DyIII analogue is not
an SMM (Figure S6).20

An axial coordination of a chloride ion to the above
complex, [Li(THF)4][Er{N(SiMe3)2}3Cl] (9), expectedly decreases the energy barrier
[(Ueff) of 63.3 K, τ0 = 1.07 × 10–7 s] (Figure S7).27

On changing the coordination
number and the geometry, in the trigonal
bipyramidal D3h-based
complexes [Ln(NHPhiPr2)3(THF)2] [Ln = DyIII (10) and ErIII (11)], the DyIII analogue
shows a better SMM behavior compared to the ErIII analogue
because the DyIII ion prefers the axial coordination of
the THF ligands (Figure S8).20

Although low-coordinate lanthanide complexes
would appear to be
extremely promising as SMMs, as discussed above, there are still only
very few such examples presumably because of the synthetic challenges
involved in their preparation. Table S1 summarizes the representative examples of complexes where the coordination
number around the lanthanide ion varies from 2 to 5.

6 Pseudolinear Complexes
With the difficulty in synthesizing
low-coordinated LnIII complexes, the alternate strategy
is to synthesize complexes with
pseudolinear Oh or D5h symmetry with two negatively
charged ligands (or two strong-field ligands) along the principal
axis with short bond lengths; the weaker ligands are present in the
equatorial plane. Such complexes can be considered as pseudolinear
complexes because of the dominating influence from the axial ligands.
Accordingly, varieties of such complexes with high Ueff values have been reported and are described below.

The complex [DyIII(BIPMTMS)2][K(18C6)
(THF)2] (12) [BIPMTMS = {C(PPh2NSiMe3)2}2– and 18C6
= 18-crown-6 ether] in which DyIII ion is present in a
pseudo-octahedral geometry shows an SMM behavior with high Ueff values of 721 and 813 K along with a blocking
temperature of 10 K (Figure 8).28 In this complex, the C–Dy–C
axis is almost linear (<C–Dy–C ≈ 177°)
with the much weaker donor ligands present in the equatorial position,
and this arrangement provides the strong axiality needed for large
±mJ numbers for the ground states.
Theoretical studies on this complex indicated that the three lowest
lying ±mJ states are ±15/2,
±13/2, and ±11/2 and are perfectly pure, and the relaxation
occurs via the fourth and fifth excited states.

A similar kind of phenomenon was also observed in a series
of complexes
possessing D5h symmetry:
[DyIII(OPCy3)2(H2O)5]Cl3 (13),29 [DyIII(OPCy3)2(H2O)5]Br3 (14),29 [DyIII(bbpen)Br] (15),30 [DyIII(bbpen)Cl]30 (16) [bbpen = N,N′-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-N,N′-bis(2-methylpyridyl)ethylenediamine)], [DyIII(OPtBu(NHiPr2)2)2(H2O)5]I3 (17),31 and
[DyIII(OtBu)2(py)5] [BPh4] (18)32 (Figures 9, S9, and S10). These complexes represent a class
where the anionic/strong-field ligands are present in the axial position
with <L–Dy–L ≈ 180° and with comparatively
weaker ligands in the equatorial position, the features which provide
a very strong axial CF for the LnIII ions.13l

The energy barriers observed
in these complexes and their correlation
with the structural features (Figure 10) can be made in the following way: the stronger the
axial bonds and weaker the equatorial bonds, the higher will be the
magnetic axiality and higher will be the Ueff. Furthermore, the smaller the deviation in the bending angle (θ)
from 180° in the axial L–Dy–L fragment, the higher
will be the magnetic axiality to stabilize the mJ = ±15/2 ground-state doublet and therefore higher will
be the Ueff.13h,13j

the energy barriers (Ueff) in complexes 14, 17, 12, 15, and 18; bond lengths are taken as the average L–Dy–L

These conclusions are
nicely corroborated theoretically for the
complex [DyIII(OPCy3)2(H2O)5]Br3 (14),29 in which the role of apparently innocent equatorial water
ligation is nicely explained. The equatorially ligated water molecules
provide the nonaxial component of the ligand field and thereby reduce
the energy barrier of the molecule drastically. Thus, removing the
water molecules from 14 generates a highly axial system
with eight Kramers doublets with a large separation, analogous to
the perfectly axial [DyO]+ molecule (Figure S12).18

In fact, the
high-symmetric geometry along with the strong axial
and weak equatorial coordination environment can lead to the SIM behavior
for an NdIII-based [NdIII(tBuPO(NHiPr2)2)(H2O)5][I]3 (19) complex
with the following characteristics: Ueff = 16.08 K and τ0 = 2.64 × 10–4 s, and Ueff = 24.69 K and τ0 = 5.03 × 10–6 s at zero dc field; Ueff = 39.21 K and τ0 = 8.98
× 10–7 s at 2000 Oe dc field.33

Recently, we have reported a pseudo-D5h-based (Et3NH)[(H2L)DyIIICl2] (20) [H4L = 2,6-diacetylpyridine
bis(salicylhydrazone)] complex (Figure 11) that shows an SMM behavior with Ueff = 70 K and τ0 = 1.9 ×
10–6 s.34

Having discussed how in high-symmetry complexes, a strong
axial
field, along with a weak equatorial field, influences the energy barrier,
it is appropriate to examine a series of complexes where changes in
the substituent on the ligands lead to an influence on the properties
(Figure 12).35

Figure 12 Line diagrams of complexes 21–24 along
with
their magnetic parameters.

All the four complexes (21–24) show a
field-induced
SIM behavior. Although all the complexes have a pentagonal bipyramidal
geometry with an approximate D5h symmetry, the difference in the relaxation dynamics can be
rationalized as follows. Continuous shape measurements indicate that
the deviation from the ideal D5h geometry (1.271 for 21, 1.904 for 22, 1.780 for 23, and 1.355 for 24) in all
the cases is different. The difference in functionalities in the first
sphere (Cl vs O, in complexes 21 and 22)
as well as outside the first sphere (complexes 23 and 24) could also effectively influence the electron density
of the first-sphere atoms and thus affect the SIM properties.

Although this review is concerned with monometallic lanthanide
complexes, it may be appropriate to comment on a 3d–4f-based
family. Thus, in the complex [Zn2Dy(L2)2(MeOH)][NO3] (25) [L2 =
2,2′,2″-(((nitrilotris(ethane-2,1-diyl))tris(azanediyl))-tris(methylene))tris-(4-bromophenol))],
the DyIII ion is in a D5h geometry (Figure S13). But, upon
aerial exposure, allowing a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation,
this complex is converted into [Zn2Dy(L2)2][NO3] (26). The latter can revert
back to 25 by taking in MeOH. The change in symmetry
from D5h to quasi-Oh induces a change in the energy
barrier from 305 cm–1 (439 K) to a negligible value,
and this is associated with the perfect axiality in the D5h–DyIII complex compared
to the Oh–DyIII complex.36Table S2 summarizes the representative examples of complexes
where the lanthanide ion possesses a coordination number of 7.

7 Coordination Number 8
The first lanthanide-based SIM,
[Bu4N][LnPc2] [Ln = TbIII (3) and DyIII (4)], was reported by
Ishikawa and co-workers in 2003, and
in these complexes the lanthanide ion may be considered as having
a coordination number of 8 (Figure 13). These complexes show an interesting SMM behavior
with the energy barriers (Ueff) of 230
cm–1 (52.8 K) and 28 cm–1 (6.4
K) and with the pre-exponential factors (τ0) of 6.25
× 10–8 and 6.25 × 10–6 s for the TbIII and DyIII analogues, respectively.11 The staggered orientation of the two phthalocyanine
moieties produces an axially elongated SAP (D4d symmetry) geometry with dpp > din (Figure 4) around the lanthanide center. Because of this high-symmetric
SAP geometry, the ground-state doublet with the large mJ value is well-separated from the first excited state,
resulting in the SMM behavior (Figure 14).

This kind of SAP geometry
favors the lanthanide ions having an
oblate electron density such as TbIII, DyIII, and HoIII in spite of the fact that TbIII and HoIII are non-Kramers ions (Figure 15). Accordingly, a variety of bis(phthalocyaninato)
lanthanide double-decker complexes with varying substituents at the
phthalocyanine center, as well as homoleptic/heteroleptic bis(phthalocyaninato)
lanthanide complexes, have been reported. Some of these are listed
in Table S3. It has been observed that
the effect of the substituents plays a crucial role in the SMM behavior
of the corresponding complexes.

Related to the sandwich
phthalocyanine complexes described above
are the complexes containing the polyoxometalate (POM) ligands, [ErW10O36]Na9 (31).38 The local symmetry around the lanthanide ion
is an axially compressed SAP geometry (D4d) with dpp < din (Figure 4), unlike that of bis(phthalocyaninato) lanthanide
complexes where the local geometry around the lanthanide ion is an
axially elongated SAP geometry with dpp > din. This has a great impact on
the
electronic configuration of the lanthanide-based POM and Pc complexes.
Because of this variation in the SAP geometry, in this complex, mJ = ±13/2 is found to be the ground state
in ErIIIPOM. As a result, this compound shows an SMM behavior
(Ueff of 56 K and τ0 of
1.6 × 10–8 s). On the other hand, [ErPc2]− (28), in which ErIII is axially elongated, does not show an SMM behavior. Similarly,
only the Er–POM complex is an SMM, whereas the analogous complexes
(TbIII, DyIII, and HoIII) are not
(Figure S15).37b,39 The plausible explanation for this discrepancy in Pc- and POM-based
lanthanide complexes may be due to the difference in the ligand fields
caused by different coordinating donors, which creates small deviations
from the ideal D4d symmetry.
The skew angle, ϕ (the angle between the diagonals
of the two squares), between the planes of the coordinating oxygen
donors in the Er–POM complex is 44.2°. This angle is almost
similar to that expected for an ideal D4d symmetry (ϕ = 45°). Analogously, in the
bis(phthalocyaninato) lanthanide complexes of TbIII and
DyIII, the angle between the Pc planes is 41.4°, resulting
in a small axial elongation of the SAP coordination geometry.

Analogous to the Ln–POM-based SIMs with D4d symmetry, a new Ln–POM family
with unusual C5 symmetry was reported,
in which the DyIII and HoIII complexes show
an SMM behavior40 (Table S4).

8 Modulation of SMM Behavior
with Ancillary Ligands/Counteranions
In this section, we
will comment on the role of the ancillary ligands/counteranions
on the magnetic properties of the eight-coordinated lanthanide complexes.
[Dy(acac)3(H2O)2] (32) possessing an eight-coordinated DyIII in a D4d symmetry was shown to be an SMM.41 Realizing that the two water molecules can be
replaced by other ancillary ligands, a variety of complexes were prepared
keeping the local D4d symmetry intact (Figure S16).42

Thus, the complex [Dy(acac)3(phen)] (33) has an energy barrier almost similar to
that of the parent complex.
However, replacement by the larger aromatic groups [dpq (34) and dppz (35)] results in higher energy barriers (136
and 187 K, respectively) in comparison to the parent analogue. Ruiz
rationalized this behavior in terms of an electrostatic interaction
model.43 All the four complexes show similar
electrostatic potential and shape, with a significant negative region
originating from the neutral ligands and a more repulsive environment
closer to the negatively charged acac ligands. Therefore, the large
delocalization effect of the neutral ligands may play a crucial role
in reducing the repulsive interaction by the acac ligands to enhance
the axial crystal effects. Accordingly, the energy barrier increases
upon incorporating the large aromatic auxiliary ligands that feature
delocalized π-electrons.44

Similar to the above, in the complexes [Dy(TTA)3Lz]
(36) (TTA = 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedionate),
[Dy(acac)3Lz]·CH3OH·0.5H2O (37) (acac = acetylacetonate), and [Dy(MQ)2Lz2]Br·CH3OH (38) (Figure S17), the capping/ancillary ligand is
varied keeping the local symmetry intact (pseudo-D4d symmetry).45 The Ueff values are 22 cm–1 (36), 56 cm–1 (38),
and 112 cm–1 (37). Moreover, magnetic
hysteresis was observed at 1.9 K in 36 and 38 and not for 37. These differences can be attributed
to the following: (1) the induction of strong electron-withdrawing
effects by the −CF3 group in 36 reduces
the magnetic axiality; (2) the weak π···π
stacking effects among the Lz ligands and the large deviation from
the ideal D4d symmetry
in 37 induce the quantum tunneling of magnetizations
in zero dc field. This is why even with the highest Ueff value, 37 does not exhibit hysteresis
at 1.9 K.

We have synthesized [Dy(LH)(tfa)2] (39)
and [Dy(LH)2]·Cl·2MeOH] (40) using
2-((6-(hydroxymethyl)pyridin-2-yl)-methyleneamino)phenol (LH2) as the ligand (Figure 16). Both these complexes show an SMM behavior in the presence
of a dc field with anisotropic energy barriers of 4.6 (2000 Oe) and
44.4 K (1000 Oe).46 The higher Ueff value in [Dy(LH)2]·Cl·2MeOH]
(40) is probably due to the strong axial anisotropy,
which is indicated by a shorter DyIII–O bond distance
in comparison to the other DyIII–donor atom distances.

Recently, our group has reported three tetranuclear complexes,
[Dy4(LH)2(CH3OH)4(acac)6] (41), [Dy4(LH)2(CH3OH)4(hmacac)6] (42), and
[Dy4(LH)2(CH3OH)4(dpacac)6] (43) using (2E,N′E)-N′-(2,3-dihydroxybenzylidene)-2-(hydroxyimino)propaneowhydrazide
(LH4) and β-diketonate as ancillary ligands (acacH = acetylacetone;
hmacacH = 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione; dpacacH = dibenzoylmethane)
(Figure 17).47 It has been shown that the change of the ancillary
ligand induces distortion in the DyIII centers that play
a major impact in the relaxation dynamics in these complexes. Complexes 42 and 43 show an SMM behavior with Ueff = 23.8 K, τ0 = 6.3 × 10–6 s, and Ueff = 29.0 K,
τ0 = 9.4 × 10–6 s, respectively,
at zero dc field. However, complex 41 displays slow relaxation
up to 10.0 K, but the corresponding energy barrier could not be obtained;
applying a dc field even up to 1000 Oe did not improve the situation.

Tang and co-workers have demonstrated that along with the
ligand
field symmetry, the cis–trans isomerism of the coordinating
atoms can also regulate the relaxation dynamics. They have reported
[DyLz2(o-vanilin)2]·X·solvent
[Lz = 6-pyridin-2-yl-[1,3,5]triazine-2,4-diamine; X = Br– (44), NO3– (45), CF3SO3– (46)] with a pseudo-D4d coordination environment around the Dy(III) center Figure S18. The cis–trans geometry of the two Lz ligands
in complexes 44–46 is shown in Figure S19. The magnetic measurements reveal that complex 45 shows an SMM behavior with an energy barrier of 615 K (484
cm–1) along with a TB of 7 K. This may be due to an axial extension from the SAP geometry
in 45, resulting in an enhanced molecular symmetry in
comparison to 44 and 46. As a result of
the enhanced molecular symmetry, magnetic relaxation in 45 probably occurs through the fourth and fifth Kramer doublet states.
This work posits a new method to modulate the geometry around the
metal center to enforce magnetic relaxation through the higher excited
states.48

Similar to the above, [DyLz2(salicylaldehyde)2]·X·solvent, with X
= OH– (47), Cl– (48), and Br– (49) having a
pseudo-D4d coordination
geometry, has been reported, in which
the counteranions perturb the coordination geometry as well as the
magnetic relaxation behavior (Figure S20). It has been proposed that an increase in the π···π
stacking between two Lz ligands (3.826 Å for 47,
and 3.596 and 3.590 Å for 48 and 49, respectively) results in axial contraction and a deviation from
the D4d symmetry, causing
the transverse anisotropy components to interact with the increased
possibility of QTM. The effect of QTM rates (τQTM/ms) is the least in 47 (24.9 ms) in comparison to that
in 48 (2.33 ms) and 49 (5.78 ms), resulting
in the highest energy barrier for 47 (Table S5). Thus, the counteranions seem to play a role in
modulating the coordination geometry around the lanthanide ion, providing
a possibility to enhance the anisotropy barriers and suppress the
quantum tunneling effect.49

Two isostructural
DyIII complexes [Dy(bimdd)] (50) and [Dy(bamdd)]
(51) (bimdd = N,N′-bis(imine-2-yl)methylene-1,8-diamino-3,6-dioxaoctane
and bamdd = N,N′-bis(amine-2-yl)methylene-1,8-diamino-3,6-dioxaoctane)
have been reported.50 These show a field-dependent
(1000 Oe) slow magnetic relaxation with Ueff values of 50 and 34 K, respectively. The difference in the energy
barriers can be attributed to the stronger ligand field of the imine
group in comparison to the amino group. Because of this, the former
can stabilize the mJ = ±15/2 ground
state, whereas the latter stabilizes the mJ = ±13/2 ground state (Figure 18).50Table S5 summarizes the representative examples of the eight-coordinate
lanthanide(III) complexes along with their magnetic properties.

9 Organometallic SIMs
In addition to the approaches
described above, another method to
maximize the axiality for LnIII-based SMMs is to employ
high rotation-symmetry ligands such as cyclooctatetraene (COT) and
cyclopentadienyl (Cp*).15b,51 Upon coordination,
the π electron cloud offers a special ligand field that induces
strong axiality. The first example of a π-coordination-based
LnIII SMM, a [(η5-Cp*)Er(η8-COT)] (52) complex (Figure 19, left),52 revealed
two thermally activated relaxation processes in zero applied field,
with the large energy barriers of Ueff = 137 and 224 cm–1 and with τ0 = 8.17 × 10–11 s and τ0 =
3.13 × 10–9 s, respectively, and with a blocking
temperature TB = 5 K. The axial character
provided by the ligand can stabilize the ground state mJ = ±15/2, which is well-separated from the mJ = ±13/2 excited state, this being a key
factor for the SIM behavior. Among the other analogues of [(η5-Cp*)Ln(η8-COT)] family [Ln = TbIII (53), DyIII (54), HoIII (55), ErIII (52), TmIII (56), and YIII (57)], only
the DyIII (Ueff = 25 cm–1, with τ0 = 7.1 × 10–8 s at Hdc = 100 Oe) and the HoIII (Ueff = 23.5 and 17 cm–1 at Hdc = 6000 Oe) complexes show an
SIM behavior (Figure 19, right). However, it has been observed that the rate of QTM increases
in the order ErIII < HoIII < DyIII, which can be attributed to the increase in transverse anisotropy
originating from the tilting of the two aromatic rings within the
molecule.53

In accordance with the above study, two complexes [K(18-crown-6)][Ln(COT)2] with Ln = ErIII (58) and DyIII (59) with two different symmetry groups show
different magnetic behaviors. The symmetry around the ErIII complex is close to D8d, whereas the DyIII complex is more eclipsed with a D8h symmetry. However, the magnetic
behavior for these two complexes is completely different: the ErIII analogue shows an SMM behavior with Ueff = 286 K and with τ0 = 3.7 × 10–9 s; the DyIII analogue is also an SMM but
with low Ueff = 11 K and with τ0 = 2.2 × 10–5 s. Moreover, the ErIII complex shows hysteresis with large coercive fields of
7000 Oe at T = 1.8 K, and the field variation is
as slow as 1 h for the entire cycle. The coercivity persists up to
about 5 K, whereas the hysteresis loops persist to 12 K. This anomaly
is explained theoretically, considering that for the DyIII complex the highest excited state with mJ = ±15/2 is the most axial (gx = 0.00, gy =
0.00, and gz = 19.88854); however, for
the ErIII analogue, the ground state with mJ = ±15/2 is strongly axial (gx = 0.00, gy = 0.00, and gz = 17.95773) and is well-separated from the first excited state mJ = ±13/2 (Figure S21).54

The most notable example in
this family is the complex [(Cpttt)2Dy][B(C6F5)4] (2) reported in 2017,
with an energy barrier Ueff = 1277 cm–1 (1837 K),
τ0 = 8.12 × 10–12 s in zero
field, and a magnetic blocking temperature of 60 K.9 It was proposed that the nearly perfect overlapping of
the carbon aromatic rings from the Cpttt ligands leads
to an extremely strong axial ligand field (Cpcentroid1···Dy···Cpcentroid2 angle of 152.56°). Furthermore, this is the
first lanthanide SMM in which all low-lying Kramers doublets maintain
a well-defined mJ value, with no significant
mixing even in the higher doublets (Figure 20). Table S6 summarizes
the representative examples of Ln(III) SIMs containing cyclic organometallic
ligands.

10 Summary and Outlook
Mononuclear LnIII complexes have been pioneered by the
sandwich phthalocyanine–LnIII (Ln = Tb and Dy) complexes.
LnIII ions possess high-spin angular momentum and large
magnetic anisotropy (except GdIII, LuIII, and,
EuIII), and hence even their mononuclear complexes are
capable of showing a slow relaxation of magnetization. However, it
is observed that in a majority of such complexes, non-Orbach relaxations,
particularly, QTM, are prevalent at zero dc field. Such temperature-independent
QTM processes shortcut the barrier heights for the magnetization reversal
causing fast relaxation. Detailed theoretical studies along with experimental
evidence show that the modulation of CF to obtain high-symmetry complexes
(such as C∞, D4d, S8, D5h, D6d, D∞h, etc.) and/or those with strong axiality stabilize
high ±mJ states as the lowest energy
states and can help in retarding the QTM process. With this background,
we have summarized some of the recent developments in the field of
lanthanide-based SIMs.

Highly symmetric mononuclear complexes
possessing a SAP geometry
(D4d)/pentagonal bipyramidal
(D5h) geometry have been
shown to be excellent SIM candidates with high energy barriers. The
high-symmetry ligand field provides the vanishing off-diagonal CF
parameters Bkq (k ≠ 0) that can diminish
the mixing of mJ levels.

The theoretical
studies reveal that two-coordinated L–LnIII–L
complexes with L–Ln–L ≈ 180°
would be of interest for high energy barrier SIMs. However, serious
synthetic challenges have to be overcome for preparing such complexes
because of the inherent preference of LnIII ions for large
coordination numbers. Because of this difficulty, there have been
efforts to make pseudolinear Oh or D5h geometries
where only along one direction strong CF interactions are present.
In many instances, such complexes have indeed been shown to be good
zero-field SIMs. Finally, mononuclear organometallic lanthanides have
been proven to be very attractive targets for molecular magnets. The
most celebrated example in this genre is [Dy(Cpttt)2][BC6F5], which has the highest blocking
temperature till date. In such complexes, the π-electron density
of the ligands appears to impose a strong axiality on the LnIII center. The ability of cyclic/acyclic π-acid ligands to stabilize
LnIII ions in various unusual coordination environments/topologies
is an attractive feature for the exploration of highly anisotropic
organometallic lanthanide complexes. Also, such anisotropic organometallic
complexes can be used as synthons for assembling multinuclear systems
where the magnetic anisotropy axes could be aligned in a specific
direction. Further, recent progress reveals that the encapsulation
of diatomic fragments such as DyO+ inside fullerene cages
to generate species such as [DyO@C60]+,18 Ln@C82,55 and Ln2@C79N,56 or the deposition on surfaces to yield species such as [DyO]+@MgO or Dy3+@MgO,57 can
be an effective strategy.

Inducing a strong magnetic coupling
interaction among the 4f ions
could be an alternative strategy to achieve better performing SMMs.17a However, it has been well-documented that because
of the shielded nature of the 4f orbitals, the coupling is generally
small (<0.1 cm–1).58 The use of radical-based ligands that bridge LnIII ions
and thereby increase the coupling interaction in the range of |10|
to |27| cm–1 (obtained from the isotropic GdIII analogues with −2J formalism) can
be a good alternative.17a−17d

In summary, although substantial progress
has been made in the
area of molecular magnets in general, and SIMs in particular, the
practical realization of these novel compounds is still elusive. This
is primarily because of the challenges that need to be overcome, which
include higher barriers to the reversal of magnetization, particularly
blocking temperatures greater than 77 K, ready assembly of the SMMs/SIMs
on surfaces,59 and the ability to address
the magnetic properties of each molecule, thus assembled on the surface.
Although these challenges appear formidable, the remarkable progress
made in this field, thus far, indicates that creative solutions to
the challenges listed will be forthcoming in the not-too-distant future.
In the meanwhile, this field will grow in further attempts to come
up with better designs of molecular magnets including exploration
of 4d and 5f metal ions.
