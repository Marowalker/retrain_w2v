Imogolite is a nanotubular
aluminosilicate that has low toxicity
in biological systems and due to its morphological and surface properties
has a growing interest in environmental applications and biomedical
areas. Its synthesis is highly sensitive to the presence of other
ions, being able to inhibit or retard the process of imogolite formation,
which could change the cytotoxic response of this substrate, something
scarcely reported in the literature. In this context, the presence
of arsenite during the synthesis of imogolite caused significant changes
in the dimensions and surface behavior of these nanotubes. Cell viability
was evaluated on EA.hy926 and HepG2 cells by (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay at 24 h. Meanwhile, the potential
effects on human red blood cells, namely, hemolysis and morphological
changes, were determined at 0 and 24 h. The range of % As tested of
the nanotube showed cell toxicity similar to the control condition.
Similarly, the As-based nanotubes induced hemolysis similar to controls
and slight morphological changes of red blood cells at 0 and 24 h
of exposition. These results indicate that As-based imogolite-like
nanotubes are not toxic nor hemolytic and can be potentially used
in processes like water purification.

1 Introduction
Within the world of nanotechnology,
nanotubes are considered key
pieces for the construction of new functional materials,1 with enormous development potential in areas,
such as electronics, biotechnology, biomedicine, sensing, separations,
energy storage/management, and catalysis.2 However, the risks toward humans and ecosystems are still scarcely
known, which limits the measures of protection to the population.3

This type of nanotubular structures can
have a pathological response
in humans, strongly conditioned by physicochemical properties, the
state of aggregation, and, in particular, the relationship between
their diameter and length; it is known as high-aspect ratio nanotubes
(HARNs) exceeding the value of 3. Its exposure can be considered risky,
causing inflammation, fibrosis, and several pathologies, including
mesothelioma, because the body’s response is a progressive
oxidative stress, which causes cell death.3,4 The
most emblematic case is what happened with asbestos; however, with
the incursion of nanotechnologies, other actors are found present
in the environment and can affect in a similar way; such is the case
of carbon nanotubes1 and silver nanowires,5 where multiple investigations have shown some
similarities to what was observed with the asbestos. In this context,
the emergence of these nanostructures has led to permeation in different
areas of science, highlighting their study on environmental issues,
where their physicochemical and morphological characteristics have
been possessed as excellent pollutant removal agents, such as Cd,
Pb, Hg, and mainly As.6 An excellent example
of the versatility of this type of structure is the imogolite, a nanotubular
aluminosilicate, which is found in the inorganic phase of soils of
volcanic origin and that was synthesized from dilute solutions of
Al and Si. Its stoichiometry is (OH)3Al2O3SiOH, and it is characterized by a hollow cylindrical shape
with an average outer and inner diameter of 2.0 and 1.0 nm, respectively,
whereas its length ranges from 100 nm to several micrometers. Its
marked surface differentiation, with isolated silanol groups (≡Si–OH)
that make up its internal surface and aluminols (≡Al2–OH y ≡Al–OH) predominant on the external surface,
make it possible to classify it as a material whose surface charge
depends on the pH, due to the rapid ionization that occurs in these
groups. These morphological and surface properties are critical to
defining the toxicity of this type of structure.7

The process of synthesis of imogolite is highly sensitive
to variables
such as the concentration of reactants, temperature, and the presence
of ions different from those usually used, which mainly causes the
synthesis to have slower kinetics or generate structural defects.7 In this context, the synthesis process of imogolite
allows modifying its composition in situ, thus obtaining different
iso-structures that have different dimensions and surface behavior.
The main iso-structures developed are those that consider the replacement
of Al and Si atoms, by elements such as germanium (Ge) and iron (Fe).
The stoichiometry of these analogous structures of imogolite is of
the type (OH)3Al2–nXnO3Si1–nYnOH (where X = Ge and Fe(III),
0 < n ≤ 2), where total or partial incorporation
of these elements modifies the dimensions of these nanotubes, which
have larger diameters and smaller lengths in comparison with the imogolite,
which would potentially impact the HARN values.

The production
of metal-based inorganic nanotubes and hybrid materials
could have diverse technological applications, including fabrication
of cellular scaffolds.8 However, questions
have been raised concerning potential toxicological effects of these
nanomaterials toward humans.9−11 In recent studies, three types
of Al–Ge nanoparticles with the same chemical composition but
various sizes and shapes showed that the size effect on the amplitude
of the genotoxic effects is less apparent when number instead of mass
concentrations are considered, although the influence of the aspect
ratio on the toxicity mechanism remains clearly marked,12 whereas another study shows that imogolite induces
less toxic effects than single-walled or multiwalled carbon nanotubes
in different cell models,13 suggesting
that imogolite-like nanotubes could be safely administered in animal
models.

Recently, Avellan et al.4 showed that
lacunar nanotubes of the Ge-imogolites and Ge-imogolites doped with
Fe (0.95% wt) inhibited or favored the bacterial growth of Pseudomonas brassicacearum, respectively. These results
show that small changes in the composition of this nanotube could
mean significant variations in its toxicity. In this context, it is
proposed to synthesize imogolite in the presence of arsenite (As(III)),
due to its similarities in the pKa values
and geometric parameters with Si(OH)4. This oxy anion is
predominant in groundwater, being highly mobile and with a greater
toxicity than that of arsenate (As(V)), because in the natural conditions
of pH this is neutral (pKa = 9.2), being
able to diffuse in mammalian organisms (including humans) and accumulate
mainly in liver, kidney, lung, and spleen.14 The mechanism involves the formation of a stable lipoic acid linked
to the enzyme, joining the sulfhydryl groups (−SH) complex.
For the most part, As(III) poisoning is explained by the inhibition
of those enzymes that require lipoic acid as coenzyme, either pyruvate
dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and α-ketoacid
dehydrogenase.

In the present study, we seek to determine if
the structure of
the imogolite is influenced by the presence of As(III), which could
be an inducer of vacancies or doping of this oxy anion and how these
changes alter the potential cytotoxicity and hemolytic properties
of imogolite exposing human cells and human blood cells to increasing
doses of As-based imogolite-like nanotubes.

2 Method
2.1 Synthesis of Imogolite and As-Containing Imogolite
(AlSiAs)
Imogolite (Imo) and As-containing imogolite (AlSiAs)
were synthesized adapting the existing protocol described by Arancibia-Miranda
et al., 2011.15 Tetraethyl orthosilicate
and sodium arsenite were added dropwise to a stirred solution of 5
mM Al(NO3)3·9H2O solution until
the Al/(Si + Oxy) ratio was 2, with a total arsenite percentage of
10–50% (hereafter called AlSiAs5, AlSiAs10, AlSiAs25, and AlSiAs50), and this mixture
was allowed to stand for 45 min with vigorous stirring. Then, a 1
× 10–3 M NaOH solution was added at a rate
of 0.5 mL/min until an Al/(Si + Oxy)/OH ratio of 2:1:4 was obtained.
Growth of the nanotubes was allowed at 95 °C for 7 days, and
the resulting suspension was dialyzed against ultrapure water. This
aging solution was dialyzed or centrifuged.

2.2 Microscopy
Analysis
The samples were
observed, with a Philips Tecnai 12 BioTween transmission electron
microscope using an 80 kV acceleration potential, on carbon substrates
prepared as follows: A drop of imogolite and AlSiAs suspended in water
was transferred onto the face of a freshly cleaved sheet of mica allowing
solvent evaporation. A thin layer of carbon was deposited onto the
surface by vacuum evaporation. The carbon/product film was separated
from the mica sheet by flotation on distilled water and subsequently
transferred to a perforated Cu support grid.

2.3 Electrophoretic
Migration (EM)
The
isoelectric point (IEP) was determined by measuring the electrophoretic
mobility of particles on a Zeta Meter 4.0 apparatus. About 30 mg of
each sample was suspended in 200 mL of a solution with ionic strength
1.0 mM (NaCl), and the EM was determined as a function of pH. The
IEP was obtained from the EM versus pH graph as the pH at which EM
= 0.

2.4 Surface Area (SBET)
The specific surface area (SBET) of imogolite and both nanocomposites was measured by the N2 method from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
theory using an automatic analyzer (Quantachrome Nova Station A).

2.5 Chemical Composition
The chemical
composition of the final Imo-As-ite products after freeze-drying was
analyzed by inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
using a Perkin Elmer Optima 2000 equipment. The samples were ground
and dissolved in a mix of a 10% nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid
solutions 24 h before the measurement. For the best accuracy, each
sample was measured seven times and one of the calibration standards
was checked every seven samples.

2.6 Cell
Culture
Human hepatocellular
carcinoma HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection HB-8065) were
grown in monolayer culture in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, NY) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic
(Gibco, NY) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
The HUVEC-derived endothelial cell line, (EA.hy926) was kindly provided
by C-J Edgell (Edgell, McDonald, & Graham, 198320) and was grown in DMEM-low glucose (GIBCO), supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 2 mmol/L and 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin
(Sigma). All cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in a 5%: 95% CO2/air atmosphere.

2.7 Cell Viability Assay
Cells were seeded
in a 96-well plate at an initial density of 5 × 103 cells/well. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with
control (Milli-Q water) or various concentrations of AlSiAs for 24
h. The (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) (MTT) method was used as we previously described.19 The absorbance of the dissolved formazan crystals
was measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan infinite f50,
Grodig, Austria).

2.8 Preparation of Human Red
Blood Cells
Red blood cells were obtained and prepared following
the protocol
previously published.16 Briefly, healthy
adults were invited to donate a small volume of blood. All donors
signed an informed consent explaining the risks of venipuncture and
the use of red blood cells only in the hemolysis study. The protocol
was evaluated and approved by a local bioethics committee. Blood was
obtained through venipuncture and anticoagulated. Immediately, blood
samples were centrifuged at 3500 RPM for 5 min. The buffy coat was
removed, and then a portion of the red blood cells was separated and
washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The washed cells were
used immediately after isolation.

2.9 Analysis
of Cell Morphology
HepG2
and EA.hy926 cells cultured in 6-well plates were exposed to different
concentrations of imogolite-As for 24 h. The cells were then washed
twice with PBS and immediately observed under a microscopy EVOS FLoid
cell (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The morphology of red blood
cells incubated with AlSiAs50 was evaluated under a microscope.
Both cultured cells and red blood cells were visualized and photographed
under a microscope (Motic AE-31). Red blood cells’ sizes were
determined using ImageJ software (NIH). Finally, cell morphology of
red blood cells was carefully evaluated, for detection of echinocytosis,
crenation, microcytosis, macrocytosis, spherocytosis, and poikilocytosis,
among others.

2.10 Analysis of Hemolysis
Hemolysis
of red blood cells exposed to growing concentrations of the AlSiAs50 (10–3–1 mg/mL). These concentrations
were selected to cover a wide range, on a logarithmic scale. Red blood
cells diluted at 1%, were treated with increasing concentrations of
imogolite-As in PBS. Furthermore, controls of hemolysis were prepared,
mixing red blood cells with distilled water or PBS, corresponding
to 100 or 0% of hemolysis, respectively. A tube containing 1 μM
imogolite was also incorporated. Hemolysis protocol was performed
as described before.16 After a brief period
of incubation and centrifugation, the supernatant was separated and
absorbance measured at 540 nm. Measurement of absorbance was performed
at 0 and 24 h.

2.11 Data Analysis
All results are presented
as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM), comparisons were
made by the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple
comparisons test using GraphPad Prism 8.0 and p <
0.05 considered significant.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Imogolite
and As-Doped Imogolite
Figure 1 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
obtained from the samples (imogolite, AlSiAs5, AlSiAs10, and AlSiAs25).

Figure 1 High-resolution TEM micrographs of (a)
imogolite; (b) AlSiAs10; (c) AlSiAs25; and (d)
AlSiAs50.

The presence of As increased the by-product concentration,
with
two different types of substrates, spherical morphology (proto-imogolite)
and needle-shaped, which would indicate that the process of obtaining
AlSiAs is not entirely clean because arsenic would have an inhibitory
or retarding role in the formation of the precursors responsible for
the formation of nanotubes.

The morphology of the samples of
AlSiAs and imogolite was evaluated
using TEM. The presence of arsenite during the synthesis of imogolite
generated modifications in the dimensions of this nanotube, mainly
in the length, wherein a significant decrease was observed in comparison
with the imogolite prepared under standard conditions of synthesis,
reaching values of an average length of <90 nm para AlSiAs50, a behavior similar to that reported for Ge-imogolite. An
ascending tendency was observed in the values of the diameter of the
imogolite, with the increase of the concentration of As(III), which
could suggest that the arsenite would have a role in the structure
of the formed precursor, which finally evolves in to the nanotube.
The diameter trend follows the sequence 2.30 = 2.30 < 2.32 = 2.32
nm for imogolite, AlSiAs10, AlSiAs25, and AlSiAs50, respectively. In addition, there is an increase in the
presence of precursor structures (proto-imogolite). These characteristics
are under a thorough study and will be presented in a future report.

The presence of arsenite in the synthesis caused changes in the
chemical composition of the samples (Table 1), observing that the Al/Si ratio was higher
than that of the imogolite (Al/Si = 2.0:1.8) as the concentration
of arsenite increased.

Table 1 Chemical Composition,
Isoelectric
Point (IEP), and Surface Area of the Formed Solids Samples
sample	imogolite	AlSiAs5	AlSiAs10	AlSiAs25	AlSiAs50	
nAl/nSi	1.9	2.1	2.2	2.7	3.0

IEP	10.1	8.7	8.3	7.7	6.8	
SBET	302	313	319	329	338	
The surface behavior, reflected
in the IEP values obtained by electrophoretic
migration of the samples synthesized in the presence of arsenite,
was significantly different in comparison to that of the imogolite
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 Electrophoretic
mobility for imogolite; AlSiAs5, AlSiAs10, AlSiAs25, and AlSiAs50.

The IEP shifted to more acidic pHs as the As(III) concentration
reached the minimum value of 6.8 for AlSiAs50, 3.3 pH units
lower than that of imogolite (Table 1). This behavior could have different contributions:
(i) the existence of by-products formed by having an Al/Si ratio greater
than that of imogolite; (ii) the potential adsorption of arsenite
on the surface of the imogolite; and (iii) a possible substitution
of Si(OH)4, for this oxy anion, which given their differences
in electronegativity (1.8 for Si and 2.2 for the As), could cause
the protons of the neighboring aluminol groups to be more acidic than
those of standard imogolite. The presence of As(III) caused an increase
in the surface area of the different products as the content of As(III)
increased.

3.2 In Vitro Cytotoxicity of
Imogolite and As-Doped
Imogolite
In the present work, we show that AlSiAs nanotubes
are not cytotoxic nor hemolytic. We determined the inhibitory effects
of increasing doses of AlSiAs 5–50 nanotubes on cell growth
in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma and EA.hy926 endothelial cell lines
after 24 h of incubation, obtaining a nonsignificant effect of cell
proliferation (Figure 3).

Figure 3 As-based AlSiAs nanotubes are not cytotoxic for human cells. HepG2
(A) and EA.hy926 (B) were treated with various doses of the % imogolite
for 24 h of incubation. Cell viability was measured using the MTT
assay. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM from three independent
experiments, each performed in triplicate. ns: not significant.

Furthermore, treatment of HepG2
and EA.hy926 cells with AlSiAs
nanotubes during 24 h resulted in a non-dose-dependent inhibition
of cell viability, preserving cell morphology (Figure 4). These results are similar to those previously
reported for other imogolite-like nanotubes,18 which indicates biocompatibility
between human cells and imogolite-As nanotubes.

Figure 4 AlSiAs50 nanotubes do
not affect HepG2 and EA.hy926 cell morphology.
Cells were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of imogolite-As
(0.1 mg/mL-25 and 50%) for 24 h of incubation. Scale bar 40 μm.

Red blood cells exposed to 1 mg/mL
AlSiAs50 nanotubes
maintained their morphology and membrane integrity in vitro, evaluated
after incubation for 24 h, at 37 °C, under sustained agitation
(Figure 5). Red blood
cells showed a normal size ranging between 7 and 8 μm; therefore,
exposition to AlSiAs50 nanotubes did not alter cell the
size of red blood cells, similar to that for controls (Figure 5C), and maintained the morphology
(Figure 5A) and a low
number of red blood cells exposed to AlSiAs50 nanotubes
showed echinocytosis and crenation, similar to standard imogolite.

Figure 5 AlSiAs
nanotubes are not hemolytic and induce low morphological
changes in human red blood cells following 1 day of exposition. (A)
Representative pictures of red blood cells exposed to water (control
of hemolysis), PBS (control of no hemolysis), AlSiAs50 nanotubes
(1 mg/mL), and imogolite (1 mg/mL) after 24 h of incubation are shown.
Exposition to the AlSiAs nanotubes did not change red blood cells’
morphology. (B) Membrane integrity was maintained, measured by hemolysis,
similar to PBS control. All experiments show mean ± standard
deviation from at least three experiments. (C) The size of red blood
cells was preserved. All conditions are shown as the mean ± SEM
from at least 50 red blood cells in every condition and from three
independent experiments. All-treated groups were not significantly
different, compared with control condition (PBS). Scale bar: 10 μm.
PBS: phosphate buffered saline; Imo: standard imogolite, Imo-As: AlSiAs50.

These results reveal that the
AlSiAs nanotubes are not cytotoxic
and induce slight changes in cell morphology, without significant
hemolysis at low and high doses, supporting the idea that the nanotube
could be further studied in animal models.

4 Conclusions
The results obtained in this study indicate that the presence of
arsenite in the synthesis of imogolite causes significant changes
in its morphology and surface behavior, possibly associated with the
adsorption or structural sites that this oxy anion would occupy. This
would affect parameters, such as Al/Si ratio, largely, and slightly,
the diameter.

In conclusion, AlSiAs nanotubes are shown to be
safe for human
cells and become a promising component for applying in water treatment
for As elimination.
