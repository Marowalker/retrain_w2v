A range of microporous,
imide-based polymers were newly synthesized
using two-step poly-condensation reactions of bis(carboxylic anhydride)
and various aromatic diamines for CO2 gas capture and storage
applications. In this report, we attempted to assess the relative
significance of molecular structural aspects through the manipulation
of the conformational characteristics of the building blocks of the
polymeric structures, the spiro-containing acid anhydride and the
aromatic amines, to induce greater intrinsic microporosity and higher
surface areas for the resulting solids. Results obtained from this
study were thus used to outline a working relationship between the
structural diversity of the constructed porous solids and their performance
as CO2 sorbents.

Introduction
Growing modern age
dependence on fossil fuel and, consequently,
increased levels of CO2 emissions have led to adverse global
environmental impacts.1−3 As a short-term solution to mitigate CO2 emissions, materials capable of capturing CO2 molecules
before escaping into the atmosphere could prove useful. Crystalline
porous materials such as zeolites and metal–organic frameworks
possess ordered molecular structures, high surface area, and, in many
cases, strong affinity toward CO2.4,5 However,
shaping such crystalline materials into moldable forms remains challenging.6,7 On the other end of the molecular order, amorphous porous materials8−11 including polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs)12 are of interest because of their ease of synthesis
and their compatibility with casting and molding processes, which
make them attractive choices in a wide range of industrial applications,
including CO2 capture and separation. Generally, polymers
lack microporosity because they possess enough conformational and
rotational freedom to pack space efficiently. However, PIMs are composed
of highly rigid and contorted molecular links with restricted conformational
freedom, preventing efficient space packing and consequently resulting
in molecular-sized interconnected voids. The rigidity is caused by
the presence of fused rings along the polymeric backbone, whereas
the contorted structures arise from the incorporation of nonplanar
sites of contortion. McKeown and co-workers have synthesized a networked
polymer consisting of phthalocyanine rings fused together with spiro-cyclic
groups to produce a highly porous material.13 In their synthesis, 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile was reacted with
5,5′,6,6′-tetrahydroxy-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylspiro-bisindane
to give the required bis-phthalonitrile. This procedure resulted in
frameworks with noteworthy microporosity as confirmed by nitrogen
adsorption measurements. These frameworks were studied as potential
gas storage materials13−16 and as heterogeneous catalysts.17,18 The term intrinsic
microporosity was introduced by McKeown in 2001 following the synthesis
of porous soluble polymers with interconnected pores designed to overcome
the loss of porosity upon desolvation, known for extrinsic microporous
materials. PIMs lack the rotational flexibility along the polymer
backbone, which guarantees that the macromolecular components are
incapable of re-adjusting their conformity upon solvent removal and
that their highly contorted shape is maintained throughout the synthesis
and activation processes.

PIMs’ structures have been
manipulated to reach desired
properties in terms of porosity,14,19−22 solubility,23 and thermal24 and mechanical25,26 properties.
Most of the PIMs that have been synthesized are composed of either
dibenzodioxin or imide repeat units. In both strategies, at least
one of the monomers has a contortion site, which provokes the formation
of the interconnected pores. The high solubility of PIMs in organic
solvents is one of their specific desirable properties. PIMs’
rigid and contorted molecular structures reduce the intermolecular
interactions through controlling the extent of contact among the polymer
chains and thus facilitating the solubility of the chains in organic
solvents. The spirobisindane unit was also found to help in improving
the polymer solubility.27 Interestingly,
PIMs exhibit no glass transition or other thermal transitions below
their decomposition temperature at around 450 °C.24 The majority of PIMs had Young’s modulus
exceeding 1 GPa24 with a deformation ability
of about 1%. The reported surface areas for several PIMs fall within
the range of 720–875 m2/g.14,19,21 Only few PIMs had a greater apparent surface
area.18 PIMs containing more flexible structures
such as those derived from the tetrahydronaphthalene unit had significantly
less surface area than the equivalent spirobisindane-based polymers.28 However, for some rigid substituents such as
fused fluorenes, a modest enhancement has been noted,29 as flexible side chains may fill the microcavities during
the polymeric chain packing. The apparent surface area was also observed
to be significantly reduced when the nitrile groups are substituted
with carboxylic, thioamide, or tetrazole groups. This was attributed
to the increase in the cohesion interactions between the polymeric
segments which subsequently improved the packing efficiency of the
polymer and thus reducing its microporosity.22,23 PIM membranes have been designed to possess both high permeability
and selectivity for use in gas separation applications.30 It was shown that PIMs are dominated by the
diffusivity selectivity model as smaller gas molecules diffuse faster.18 PIMs’ gas selectivity also falls above
or near the upper bound line for several commercially significant
gas mixtures, including CO2/CH4, H2/N2, and H2/CH4. The microporosity
of PIMs provides a moderate to high capacity for gas uptake, which
might be the reason behind their high apparent gas solubility. It
has been noticed that polymers with rigid molecular structures usually
fall on or close to Robeson’s upper bound line.18

It is the purpose of the current study
to synthesize novel microporous
materials based on the manipulation of the conformational characteristics
of the building blocks of the polymeric structures to investigate
the structure–property relation through outlining the diamine
rigidity effect on the overall polymeric chain rigidity and consequently
its characteristics including surface area, porosity, and behavior
toward CO2 adsorption. In this regard, five novel tailored
PIMs were synthesized and tested for their ability and selectivity
to capture and store carbon dioxide gas. The design of the PIMs presented
here is inspired from a computational chemical investigation conducted
earlier.31,32 The synthesis of different polymers is accompanied
by complete characterization of their chemical structure by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), and elemental analysis, with the achieved molecular weights
and the degree of polymerization determined using gel permeation chromatography
(GPC). Gas sorption analyses were utilized to investigate the microporosity
and CO2 gas sorption capacity and affinity for the constructed
PIMs.

Results and Discussion
The current study aimed at probing
the underlying structure–function
relationship in a tailored family of PIMs. Toward this goal, a number
of such polymers sharing the same spiro center but with several different
diamine moieties, with different rigidities, were constructed. The
selected diamine molecules were utilized to produce six different
polymers, of which five are novel structures with one polymer previously
published elsewhere33 and synthesized herewith
for comparison purposes. On the basis of our previous computational
investigation for a similar family of PIMs,31,32 the aromatic diamines utilized here were carefully selected to provide
a wide range of conformational behaviors in the targeted PIMs. In
this report, we opted to conduct a systematic, computational-guided,
experimental investigation of the interplaying structure–function
relationships that determine the overall gas sorption characteristics
of the selected family of PIMs.

As shown in Scheme 1, PIM-AUC-1 and PIM-AUC-2 have
the diamine groups separated either
by oxygen or ethylene groups which might result in some flexibility
in the polymer chains. However, for PIM-AUC-3 and 4, for example,
the diamines have fused aromatic rings in different orientations which
are expected to result in a certain degree of constricted conformational
flexibility and thus influencing the polymer’s ultimate physical
properties. Finally, PIM-AUC-5 and -6 have diamines with connected
rings in different orientations which are expected to have a higher
flexibility than the fused rings and lower than the flexible group
separated rings.

PIM Synthesis
Polycondensation polymerization
is the
method used to synthesize polyimides from the corresponding bis(carboxylic
anhydrides) and aromatic diamine monomers. The synthesis of the polyimides
reported here started with preparation of the dianhydride monomer.
The nucleophilic substitution reaction of 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile
(1) and 5,5′,6,6′-tetrahydroxy-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-1,1′-spirobisindane
(2), followed by hydrolysis of the nitrile groups, and
then dehydration of the carboxylic acids have led to the formation
of 9,9,9′,9′-tetramethyl-8,8′,9,9′-tetrahydro-7,7′-spirobi[indeno[5′,6′:5,6][1,4]dioxino[2,3-f]isobenzofuran]-1,1′,3,3′-tetraone (5), referred to shortly as bis(carboxylic anhydride), as shown
in Scheme 1.33 PIM-AUC-1 was synthesized by polycondensation
reaction of (5) and 4,4′-oxydianiline, a diamine
with conformational flexibility around a central oxygen atom. Similarly,
PIM-AUC-2 was synthesized through an imide condensation of (5) and 4,4′-ethylenedianiline, a ditopic diamine with
some conformational flexibility around the ethylene bridge. In contrast
to the two abovementioned examples, PIM-AUC-3 and PIM-AUC-4 were prepared
by the reaction of (5) and the aromatic diamines 1,5-diaminonaphthalene
and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene, respectively. Both of the ditopic amines
utilized in the construction of PIM-AUC-3 and PIM-AUC-4 demonstrate
fused aromatic rings with expected constriction in their conformational
flexibility. Both aromatic diamines used to prepare PIM-AUC-5 and
PIM-AUC-6, namely, the 2,2′-biphenyldiamine and benzidine,
respectively, exhibit a rigid biphenyl group as a spacer between the
two amine moieties in both molecules. After completion of the polymerization
reactions, the isolated compounds were exchanged with methanol to
remove any solvent trapped within the polymeric matrices pores, prior
to conducting further characterization analyses. A myriad of structural
and composition analysis techniques including the FTIR, NMR, elemental
analysis, GPC, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) techniques were
utilized to probe the structure and composition of the synthesized
polymers.

The FTIR spectra shown in Figure 1 of the PIMs isolated clearly indicated the
formation of the imide bonds as evident from comparison of the spectra
of the six PIMs with the dianhydride monomer. The absence of absorption
bands characteristic of primary or secondary amines in the range of
3000–3500 cm–1 accounts for the formation
of the tertiary amine (R–N(CO)2). The observed shift
in the carbonyl (C=O) peaks from 1840 to 1760 cm–1 in the anhydride monomer to lower wavenumbers 1780–1750 cm–1 in all the synthesized polymers assures the substitution
of the oxygen atom of the anhydride with the nitrogen of the diamines.
PIM-AUC-3 is also in a great agreement with polyimide-based-PIMs found
in the literature, especially PIM-PI-7 synthesized by Ghanem et al.,33 which is used for comparative reasons in this
report. In 1H NMR, singlets in range of δ 1.33–1.39
ppm and doublets in the range of δ 2.19–2.35 ppm in all
synthesized polymers represent 12H atoms of 4 methyl groups and 4H
atoms of 2 methylene groups, respectively, which indicate the presence
of the spiro ring. In addition, the singlets in range of δ 6.39–6.73
ppm represent the 4H atoms in the aromatic rings of the dianhydride
monomer. All the peaks ensure that the dianhydride monomer remained
unchanged except through the condensation reaction with the diamine
monomer which has been presented through the different multiple peaks
found from the range δ 7–9 ppm and differs according
to the type of the diamine used. Additionally, in 13C NMR,
signals with chemical shifts at δ 30, 31, 43, 57, and 59 ppm
represent 4CH3, 2CH2, 2C, and 1C, respectively.
These signals are ascribed to the carbons in the spiro rings. The
reactions of the dianhydride monomer with different diamines have
been confirmed through the signals with a chemical shift in the range
of δ 110–170 ppm that represent the aromatic and carbonyl
carbons. The signal at δ 166 ppm in all the synthesized polymers
indicates the presence of carbonyl groups.

Figure 1 FTIR analysis of the
six synthesized PIM-AUCs.

All prepared polymers showed high thermal stability, as indicated
by their corresponding thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Common to
all tested PIM-AUCs (1–6), there was an observed single degradation
temperature (ranging from 450 to 550 °C) that can be ascribed
to the presence of the highly stable imide groups; see the Supporting Information. This range agrees with
the thermal degradation range reported by Ghanem et al. in the synthesis
of PIM-PI.33 As mentioned formerly, the
prepared samples were pretreated with methanol which ensures the removal
of any trapped solvent or guest molecules; this was also confirmed
by TGA thermograms, as no weight losses were observed for the majority
of the compounds before their thermal degradation, indicating successful
removal of guest molecules from the synthesis.

Nitrogen sorption
isotherms measured at 77 K were utilized to evaluate
the surface area and porosity of the synthesized polymers, as shown
in Figure 2. The polymers
present significant adsorption at low relative pressures, an indication
of the presence of microporosity, as shown in Figure 2 with an increasing uptake with increasing
relative pressures. It is also obvious from the figure that for all
the polymeric structures, the desorption curve lies well above the
adsorption curve, indicating significant hysteresis that was extended
to the low relative pressure region. This could be explained by considering
the tortuosity of the pore structures. This behavior can be ascribed
to swelling of the materials due to flexibility of the polymer chains.
As shown in Table 1, the apparent BET surface areas were determined to be in the range
of 360–510 m2/g (except for PIM-AUC-1 and PIM-AUC-2,
demonstrated surface areas of 61 and 81 m2/g, respectively).
The total pore volume was calculated from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed
at a relative pressure p/p°
= 0.98 and was found to be in the range of 0.4–0.59 cc/g (except
for PIM-AUC-1 and PIM-AUC-2, which were found to possess total pore
volume 0.08 and 0.23 cc/g, respectively).

The abovementioned data pointed to the significance
of maintaining
the intrinsic microporosity introduced by the tourtousness of the
spiro center13 by utilizing rigid diamine
linkers. This conclusion is supported by the observed modest porosity
of both PIM-AUC-1 and PIM-AUC-2, where both polymers contain the same
spiro center as other PIMs reported here but with more flexible diamine
linkers. Therefore, although intrinsic microporosity does stem from
the spiro-containing monomer, it also needs to be translated to the
microstructure through a rigid diamine moiety. In previous works,
Mckweon and Ghanem14,33 utilized mostly fused ring structures
or, alternatively, rings with bulky side chains to construct PIMs
of high surface areas. As it gets more difficult for the polymer chains
to swirl around during packing, as a consequence of the presence of
these bulky side groups or the stiff fused ring structures, the chains
are forced to form pores with greater size cavities and larger surface
areas. In PIM-AUC-4 and -6, rather larger surface areas and pore volumes
were observed. This is to be expected because of utilization of the
rigid diamine monomers. Applying the nonlocal density functional theory
model of carbon finite pore systems to the adsorption isotherms permitted
calculation of the PSD histograms for the analyzed PIMs, as shown
in Figure 3. The PSD
histograms indicated three distinctive categories of pore systems
inside the six PIMs analyzed. For PIM-AUC-1 and -2, similar PSD patterns
were observed, centered around 15 Å for the most prominent pore
system. This is in contrast to PIM-AUC-4 and -5, where the most significant
pore systems were more dispersed and observed at 6, 14, 17, and 30–35
Å. PIM-AUC-4 and -5 demonstrated closely similar patterns for
their PSD, demonstrating three size ranges for their pore systems.
PIM-AUC-3 and -6 demonstrated comparable PSD patterns with most of
the pores distributed between 7 and 15 Å. As PIM-AUC-3–6
were constructed with different bridging rigid diamines, the similarities
and differences between the observed PSD histograms cannot be directly
explained. It appeared to us that the main driving force for similarities
and differences between the PSD histograms can originate from differences
in the packing of the polymers’ chains, and thus, more in-depth
investigation into the packing of such polymers is needed. A detailed
computational analysis of the most energetically favored packing for
the abovementioned polymers indicated two major packing patterns that
are in agreement with the experimentally observed trends.32

Figure 3 Pore size distribution (PSD) histograms for PIM-AUC-1–6.

Moreover, the observed trends
in PSD mapped well into the initial
values for the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) of CO2 inside the PIMs, especially for PIM-AUC-3
and -6. As both compounds demonstrated a narrow pore size for relatively
significant population of their pore systems, these two compounds
also demonstrated the highest initial Qst for CO2. Variable temperature (0, 10, and 20 °C)
carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms were collected for the PIMs reported
herein Figure 4; see
the Supporting Information for further
data. It was observed that PIM-AUC-4 adsorbed the highest CO2 quantity through the temperature ranges compared to other PIM-AUCs,
which is in agreement with being the most porous structure among the
probed compounds. Additionally, PIM-AUC-1 and -2, being the least
porous, demonstrated the lowest total uptake of CO2. In
agreement with the abovementioned general trend, PIM-AUC-3, -5, and
-6 demonstrated total CO2 uptake in between the two extremes.

Figure 4 CO2 gas adsorption isotherms for PIM-AUC-1–6
at 0 °C.

The Qst plots for CO2 in
the reported PIM-AUCs are shown in Figure 5. The calculated Qst reported here falls within the range of 25–33 kJ/mol. As
expected, the Qst plots for PIM-AUC-3
and -6 demonstrated steeper decay as compared to the other PIMs, which
could be rationalized based on quick saturation of the smaller pores,
that is, those centered at 6 Å. From the above, it is concluded
that to attain best performing material of this family toward CO2 capture applications, a proper tuning of the high surface
area with narrow pore systems is required. The example of PIM-AUC-4,
in contrast to PIM-AUC-3 and -6, demonstrated clearly that merely
the high surface area with no control over the pore dimensions can
contribute to high overall uptake of CO2 but will inevitably
affect the affinity of the solid toward CO2.

Figure 5 CO2Qst plots for the PIM-AUC-1–6.

To probe the material selectivity
toward CO2 in a CO2/N2 mixture, we
utilized the ideal gas adsorption
theory (IAST)34 to calculate the CO2/N2 selectivity for all the PIMs reported here.
The data points from the N2 and CO2 sorption
isotherms, all measured at 273 K, were utilized into pyIAST35 to calculate the selectivity in a mixture of
10% CO2 in N2, as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 IAST calculated CO2/N2 selectivity for the
studied PIMs at two different total pressures.

In performing these calculations, pure gas loadings were
required
as inputs, and thus, the BET isotherm model was fitted on each of
the pure gas isotherms. The resulted curves were then used to predict
pure gas loadings at any pressure, that is, within the measured pressure
range. In few cases, some minor extrapolations of the fitted analytical
curve were required. The following formula was used to calculate the
selectivity of CO2 over N2 1  where ϕi is the polymer loading of ith gas at equilibrium
with the gas mixture and ni is the gas phase molar fraction of the ith
gas. We opted to use two relatively low total pressure regimes for
calculating the selectivity to avoid unreliable extrapolation of isotherm
points beyond the experimental measurements because of the low uptake
of N2 at 273 K. Nevertheless, our materials demonstrated
appreciable to high selectivity, for example, up to 40 in the case
of PIM-AUC-4, as compared to 16.6–19.3 previously reported
for prototypal PIMs.36,37 In addition, our system demonstrated
facile tunability of CO2/N2 selectivity based
on the polymer chain packing/structure, rather than through chemical
modifications of the polymer repeat units, whereas chemical modification
through incorporation of Lewis base sites including amines and thioamides
was shown to enhance the PIM selectivity to CO2.23,38

Conclusions
We demonstrated here a family of PIMs sharing
the same functionality
in their backbone structures and constructed through imide condensation
reactions. A clear structure–property relationship is outlined
where the degree of freedom of the bridging diamine functionality
transforms well into the observed gas sorption characteristics of
the corresponding polymer. As this particular class of compounds demonstrated
high thermal stability and appreciable solubility in many organic
solvents, their utilization in casted or molded structures, as thin
films and/or membranes, is facilitated. Furthermore, the systematic
investigation presented here established the potential for tailoring
the solid–gas interactions through controlling the overall
porosity and pore dimensions, targeting applications in gas sensing
and separation.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
the starting materials including 4,5-dichlorophthalic
acid, potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, and the following
six diamines, namely, (i) 4,4′-oxydianiline, (ii) 4,4′-ethylenedianiline,
(iii) 1,5-diaminonaphthalene, (iv) 1,8-diaminonaphthalene, (v) 2,2′-biphenyldiamine,
and (vi) benzidine were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrahydroxy-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-1,1′-spirobisindane
was purchased from Alfa Aesar, Inc., Germany. The abovementioned chemicals
were used as received without further purification. All other reagents
and solvents such as formamide, 33% ammonium hydroxide, thionyl chloride, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol, hydrochloric
acid, acetic acid, acetic anhydride, toluene, anhydrous toluene, m-cresol, quinolone, methanol, and chloroform (CH3Cl) were purchased from various commercial sources. The DMF dried
over molecular sieves (4 A, 1–2 mm beads) was also purchased
from Alfa Aesar, Germany, and stored under nitrogen.

Spectral, Elemental,
and Chromatographic Analyses
FTIR
spectra of all synthesized polymers were recorded on a Thermo Scientific,
Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra were
recorded on Genini-300BB (300 MHz) in CDCl3 as the solvent
using TMS [Si(CH3)4] as the internal standard,
and chemical shifts were expressed as ppm. 13C NMR spectra
were recorded in CDCl3. Elemental analyses were performed
on a Thermo Scientific, FLASH 2000 CHNS/O analyzer. Molar mass distributions
were determined by GPC with THF as the solvent. Measurements were
carried out using Agilent 1100 series, Germany, equipped with a refractive
index detector. Each sample (0.01 g) was dissolved in 2 mL of THF
and filtrated using a syringe filter of 0.45 μm before being
placed in the GPC device. The samples were compared to a polystyrene
standard, and the PL-gel particle size was about 5 μm. Three
columns of pore types 100, 104, and 105 Å were placed on series
of a length 7.5 × 300 mm. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns
of the samples were obtained using a D8 Bruker X-ray powder diffractometer.
The PXRD patterns of the samples were obtained for a 2θ range
between 5° and 80° with a step increment of 0.03 per s.

Synthesis of the Bisphthalonitrileanddianhydride Monomer
4,5′-Dichlorophthalonitrile was prepared as outlined elsewhere,39 starting from 4,5′-dichlorophthalic acid.
Bisphthalonitrile was then synthesized from 5,5′6,6′-tetrahydroxy-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-1,1′-spirobisindane
according to the procedures outlined by Maffei et al.40 The tetracarboxylic acid and its dianhydride monomer were
prepared according to procedures outlined by Ghanem et al.33

Typical Procedure for the Synthesis of PIM-AUCs
For
each one of the six prepared PIMs, the following procedures were executed
in a similar fashion. To a 50 mL three-neck rounded-bottom flask equipped
with a Dean–Stark trap, nitrogen inlet, and reflux condenser,
1.15 g (1.83 mmol) of the dianhydride monomer and 1.83 mmol of the
diamine were added, followed by 10 mL of m-cresol,
0.1 mL of quinoline, and 2 mL of anhydrous toluene. After stirring
at room temperature for half an hour, the temperature of the reaction
mixture was raised gradually to 200 °C and was kept at that temperature
for further 5 h. Water was constantly removed from the reaction mixture
by azeotropic distillation. After cooling, the resulting solution
was diluted with 20 mL of chloroform. The mixture was added dropwise
to a vigorously stirred 600 mL methanol. The resulting solid precipitate
was then collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. Scheme 1 illustrates the
general procedures for the chemical preparation of the six different
PIMs used in this study. It should be mentioned that PIM-AUC-3 has
the same chemical structure as that of PIM-PI-7, previously prepared
by Ghanem et al.33 under the code name
PIM-PI-7. The polymer was prepared as a reference material to facilitate
the comparison with previous studies.

Characterization of PIM-AUCs
as CO2 Capture and Storage
Agents
The thermal stability profiles of the different polymers
were revealed using TGA (TGA Q50, TA Instruments). Five milligrams
of each polymer were placed in the platinum pan and tested under a
60 mL/min purge of nitrogen. The samples were then heated up to 700
°C with a rate of 10 °C/min. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms were determined using the Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface
area and porosimetry analyzer, and the isotherms were analyzed to
obtain the BET surface area, pore volume, and PSD in all the synthesized
polymers. The samples (20–50 mg) were degassed at 120 °C
with a rate of 1 °C/min and 10 μmHg pressure with a rate
of 5 mmHg/s. This was followed by the analysis of the degassed samples
using N2 gas at 77 K (liquid nitrogen). Carbon dioxide
isotherms were also evaluated; however, in these analyses, the temperature
was controlled by means of a chiller (LAUDA RA8) filled with water
and the ethylene glycol mixture (10% ethylene glycol). The analysis
was carried out at three different temperatures, namely 0, 10, and
20 °C.
