The low-frequency vibrational (LFV)
modes of biomolecules reflect
specific intramolecular and intermolecular thermally induced fluctuations
that are driven by external perturbations, such as ligand binding,
protein interaction, electron transfer, and enzymatic activity. Large
efforts have been invested over the years to develop methods to access
the LFV modes due to their importance in the studies of the mechanisms
and biological functions of biomolecules. Here, we present a method
to measure the LFV modes of biomolecules based on Raman spectroscopy
that combines volume holographic filters with a single-stage spectrometer,
to obtain high signal-to-noise-ratio spectra in short acquisition
times. We show that this method enables LFV mode characterization
of biomolecules even in a hydrated environment. The measured spectra
exhibit distinct features originating from intra- and/or intermolecular
collective motion and lattice modes. The observed modes are highly
sensitive to the overall structure, size, long-range order, and configuration
of the molecules, as well as to their environment. Thus, the LFV Raman
spectrum acts as a fingerprint of the molecular structure and conformational
state of a biomolecule. The comprehensive method we present here is
widely applicable, thus enabling high-throughput study of LFV modes
of biomolecules.

==== Body
Introduction
The
low-frequency vibrational (LFV) modes in the terahertz (THz)
range (0.1–10 THz, 3–333 cm–1)1−3 have been studied extensively due to their significance in providing
information related to the dynamics and functional mechanisms of biomolecules’
activities, including collective modes of proteins,4,5 ligand
binding,6−8 protein interaction,9 electron
transfer,10 and enzymatic activity.11,12

The importance of studying the LFV modes in biomolecules has
led
to the development of many methods to access the THz range. These
include far-infrared Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), attenuated
total reflectance (ATR),13 and Raman spectroscopies
based on double- or triple-stage technology,14 inelastic neutron scattering,15 synchrotron
irradiation,16,17 THz time-domain spectroscopy
(THz-TDS),18 heterodyne-detected Raman-induced
Kerr-effect spectroscopy (OHD-RIKES),19 and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS).20

The correlation between the molecular mechanisms
of biomolecule
activity and LFV spectra can be more meaningful if the study is performed
in a hydrated environment. Such studies are difficult to carry out
because of the strong absorption of water in the THz range.21,22 Several solutions to overcome this problem have been suggested and
subsequently implemented, depending on the spectroscopic method used
to study the LFV modes. For far-infrared FTIR and THz-TDS,23 samples have been pressed with polyethylene
(PE) powder into a pellet form or spin-cast as a thin film for ATR.13 When using synchrotron radiation, samples have
been lyophilized in vacuum chambers24 and
in some cases cryogenically cooled,25,26 and in the
case of OHD-RIKES, highly concentrated protein solutions were used.19 A challenge in measuring LFV modes is to develop
an affordable, nondestructive, noninvasive, and robust method that
can allow high-throughput study of biomolecules in nearly any lab
or field environment.

In this article, we demonstrate a new
approach to studying the
LFV modes of biomolecules based on Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy
is a well-established technique to probe the vibrational modes of
materials that can provide detailed information about the composition,
stoichiometry, and crystalline phase of the materials under investigation.
Even though Raman scattering has been used extensively in life-science
research, studies of the LFV modes via Raman spectroscopy have been
limited due to difficulty in performing the experiments. The traditional
approaches for measuring the LFV Raman modes are accomplished by a
triple spectrometer27 to reject the laser
light or I2 gas filters to absorb the narrow band laser
light.28 Such optical setups are complicated
and expensive and also suffer from low collection efficiency of the
Raman signal. The recent development of notch filters based on volume
holographic gratings (VHGs) has made it possible to measure LFV Raman
modes down to 5 cm–1 using a single-stage spectrometer.
Using these filters, it is also possible to measure both Stokes and
anti-Stokes LFV Raman modes simultaneously. Generally, Raman scattering
arises from symmetric stretching and bending vibrations of molecules,
whereas THz absorption deals mainly with asymmetric stretching vibrations.
Thus, owing to the different selection rules governing Raman and IR
transitions, both Raman and IR spectroscopies provide complementary
spectral information about LFV modes of biomolecules.

Using
a single-stage spectrometer and VHG notch filters, here,
we study the previously unexplored LFV Raman modes of basic biomolecules
such as amino acids, peptides, proteins, and DNA while taking considerations
of earlier works by other techniques. We obtain Raman spectra for
biomolecules in a hydrated environment, with high signal-to-noise
ratios, at low laser power, and with short acquisition times. To the
best of our knowledge, until now there has been no systematic study
of the LFV Raman modes of biomolecules. The approach we demonstrate
here enables the study of biomolecules in their native hydrated environment
with minimal sample preparation, thus providing a direct, robust,
and relatively inexpensive method for high-throughput study of biomolecules.

Results
and Discussion
Here, we present the application of Raman
spectroscopy to the study
of the LFV modes of proteins and their building blocks, amino acids
and peptides, and short synthetic DNA oligonucleotides. The LFV Raman
system we developed allows measurement down to frequencies as low
as 8 cm–1 in both the Stokes and anti-Stokes regions.
The air-dried spots of biomolecules hold enough water to maintain
a hydrated environment.

Amino Acids
Amino acids, which are
the fundamental
building units of proteins, are very important compounds as they take
part in major metabolic processes, namely, growth, formation of new
tissues, and biosynthesis of enzymes and hormones in the body. Phenylalanine
is one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. It plays a key role
in the biosynthesis of tyrosine and vital hormones like norepinephrine
and epinephrine. Recently, phenylalanine was used as a building block
for self-assembled metal nanowires.29 Previous
studies of LFV modes carried out by THz-TDS30 or rapid-scan FTIR spectroscopy31 dealt
with polycrystalline forms of phenylalanine mixed with PE powder pressed
into round disks. However, to our knowledge, there is no theoretical
as well as experimental published literature available that describes
the LFV modes of phenylalanine using Raman spectroscopy. Figure 1 shows the LFV Raman
spectrum of phenylalanine. The spectrum consists of several well-resolved
peaks located at 9.4, 24.6, 39.6, 64.6, 98.7, 132.7, 142.8, and 178.8
cm–1. Generally, the Raman modes between 130 and
200 cm–1 arise from frustrated rotation and translation
of one or more molecules (also known as intermolecular modes), whereas
the modes below 130 cm–1 are assigned to the lattice
modes of organic crystals.32 As the rotational
oscillations are stronger than the translational modes, the strongest
peak that is observed at 98.7 cm–1 can be attributed
to rotation. The exact identification of the peaks needs to be carried
out in a future study.

cm–1 range.

Model Amphipathic Peptide
LFV modes are important for
the characterization of peptide structures as the observed spectra
result from peptide backbone motions and hydrogen bond vibrations
and therefore directly reflect the peptide secondary structure.33 Thus, the relationship between the delocalized
backbone motions and the functional flexibility or rigidity of peptides
can be probed with LFV Raman and THz spectroscopic approaches. Several
peptides were previously studied in the LFV region, including lyophilized
short-chain peptides by THz absorption and neutron vibrational spectroscopy,34 highly concentrated solution of di- and poly-l-alanine by OHD-RIKES,35 alanine-rich
peptides by THz-TDS using custom-made copper cold finger, and by FTIR
with synchrotron light source using liquid samples placed between
the two polypropylene windows.36 In this
study, we examined the LFV Raman modes of a model amphipathic peptide,
K4L8.37 We found
that the LFV Raman spectra of K4L8 did not show
any vibrational peaks in the wavenumber range below 100 cm–1 (Figure 2). However,
a weak and broad shoulder centered at 140 cm–1 was
observed that can be assigned to the localized backbone torsions.19

Lysozyme and Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA)
Lysozyme, an
enzyme which hydrolyzes the polysaccharides found in many bacterial
cell walls, and BSA, the main protein in bovine plasma, are widely
used models for studying the THz range of proteins. BSA studies include
using THz spectroscopy,38 THz coherent
synchrotron radiation,39 pulsed THz spectroscopy,40 and THz-TDS.41 Lysozyme
studies include employing Raman spectroscopy with a double monochromator,42 OHD-EIKES,35 THz-TDS,43 FTIR-Raman spectroscopy with holographic grating,44 and femtosecond optical Kerr effect (OKE) Raman
spectroscopy.45

Here, we measured
the LFV Raman spectra of lysozyme and BSA for the first time in a
hydrated environment, as described earlier in this work. Figure 3a shows the LFV Raman
modes of lysozyme with Stokes (right) and anti-Stokes (left) spectra.
The Raman spectra reveal a strong peak centered at 28 cm–1, attributed to intermolecular vibration, and an additional broad
shoulder centered around 70 cm–1. The lysozyme contains
both α and β configurations of the peptide chains;46 therefore, the low-frequency line at 70 cm–1 may arise from the torsional motion of peptide chains
with α configuration and the weaker peak at 166 cm–1 can be due to the bending motion of peptide chains with β
configuration, as explained by Genzel et al.42 Our observations are in agreement with the work that Genzel et al.
carried out using a double-monochromator-based Raman spectrometer
on crystalline lysozyme.42,47

The Stokes spectrum contains a peak at 28 cm–1,
which we assign to intermolecular vibration as described for lysozyme.

as reported by Mazur et al.48 by ultrafast
OKE.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Fragment Antigen Binding (Fab) Immunoglobulins
IgG is a large, Y-shaped molecule that consists of two identical
light (L) and two identical heavy (H) polypeptide chains folded into
12 independent domains called β-barrels. Furthermore, each polypeptide
chain is divided into variable (V) and constant (C) regions representing
unique and evolutionarily conserved sequences, respectively. Therefore,
with regard to both the sequence (V, C) and the polypeptide chain
length (L, H), the β-barrels can be grouped into three categories
as VL (two β-barrels), VH (two β-barrels),
and CH/L (eight β-barrels).49 The two arms of the Y are each composed of VL, VH, and two CH/L β-barrels, whereas the base
of the Y (Fab fragment) comprises four CH β-barrels
and contains the complementary binding site. The Fab fragment of IgG
is composed of the L chain and only the N-terminal part of the H chain.

Chou et al. mathematically calculated the low-frequency Raman modes
of VH, VL, and CH/L as 28.3, 35.8,
and 28.6 cm–1, respectively.5 Their calculations were in agreement with earlier experimental LFV
Raman measurements by a double-monochromator spectrometer of lyophilized
and hydrated bovine IgG that showed three clear peaks at 28, 36, and
60 cm–1, which were considerably broadened upon
hydration.50 Later, the same group attempted
to reproduce these results with rabbit and human IgG and found that
both spectra displayed a strong peak at 28 cm–1.
However, the second mode near 36 cm–1 only appeared
as a shoulder in the spectrum of rabbit IgG and was practically indiscernible
in the spectrum of human IgG.14 In a recent
study, the Raman spectrum of murine IgG2a monoclonal antibody was
examined in the THz region and a structured band with a maximum at
80 cm–1 was observed.51 This band also had a shoulder on its lower frequency side near 40
cm–1.

Here, we measured the LFV Raman spectra
of whole horse IgG as well
as its Fab fragment. We found that the Raman spectrum of the whole
horse IgG showed a peak at 14 cm–1, a broad peak
centered around 30 cm–1, and a broad shoulder centered
around 70 cm–1 (Figure 5). In general, the broad appearance of the
spectrum can be attributed to an increase in the scattering associated
with the hydrated environment, in agreement with the observations
of Painter et al.50 by a double-monochromator
spectrometer. Despite the major differences between the sequences
and structures of the whole IgG and its Fab fragment, the spectrum
of the Fab fragment displayed a very similar spectrum, differing primarily
in the broader appearance of the 30 cm–1 peak (Figure 6). At close observation,
this broad peak at 30 cm–1 presents shoulders that
appear to originate from two closely spaced peaks near 28 and 35 cm–1 (Figure 7b). The shoulders were not observable in the whole IgG spectrum
(Figure 7a) because
of the presence of 10 β-barrels (two VH and eight
CH/L domains) that all generate low-frequency breathing
modes near 28 cm–1, which dominate the signal, as
opposed to the two VL β-barrels (that generate the
low-frequency breathing mode at 35 cm–l). In contrast,
the Fab fragment is composed of only six VH and CH/L β-barrel domains; thus, in its Raman spectrum, the low-frequency
breathing modes of the VL β-barrels become more dominant,
allowing for the partial appearance of the 35 cm–1 peak. Together, these results show an observable change in the spectra
arising from the structural differences between the Fab fragment and
the whole IgG.

components superimpose on the experimental LFV Raman spectrum. The

Savitzky–Golay smoothing and the dashed lines represent the
fitted components.

Methylated Oligonucleotide
As was shown for the above
biomolecules, the LFV Raman spectroscopy is applicable to both natural
amino acids and amino acid complexes of either small peptides or large
protein molecules. In the case of DNA, it is particularly interesting
to see if the LFV Raman spectrum shows measurable changes in frequency
or intensity following DNA epigenetic modifications. DNA methylation
is an important epigenetic modification that primarily occurs on cytosine
(C) bases in the context of symmetric 5′ cytosine–guanine
(CpG) dinucleotides. It has important implications in gene regulation,
for example, X-chromosome inactivation and long-term gene silencing,52−55 and in recent years it has become apparent that DNA methylation
is potentially responsible for cancer initiation and various genetic
diseases.56−60

Several techniques have been developed to provide information
on DNA methylation at different levels, but so far most of them are
laborious and time-consuming.61 In this
relation, vibrational spectroscopy techniques facilitate the acquisition
of biochemical signatures based on chemical bonds presented within
cellular material with minimum preparations and no requirement of
radioactive or fluorescent labeling.62 A
previous study with ATR–FTIR spectroscopy demonstrated specificity
and sensitivity in determining single DNA base changes.63 More recently, it was shown that methylation-induced
changes in DNA were specifically and sensitively detected in the 800–1700
cm–1 region by Raman spectroscopy.64

Here, we measured the effects of DNA CpG methylation
using LFV
Raman spectroscopy. Figure 8 shows the LFV Raman spectrum of 5mC – DNA (unmethylated),
with well-defined peaks at 20, 31, 65, 80, 103, 130, and 175 cm–1. After methylation, the LFV Raman spectrum of 5mC
+ DNA shows peaks located at 27, 71, 103, 130, and 175 cm–1 in comparison with 5mC – DNA (Figure 9). This change in the spectral features can
be attributed to a decrease of the interhelical distance and/or to
increases in the intrahelical spring constant due to methylation.65 We also examined the sample under microscope
and observed a change in the morphology from the large crystalline
domains of 5mc – DNA to needlelike crystallites of 5mc + DNA
(Figure 10).

In summary, Table 1 compares the LFV
Raman modes for the biomolecules studied here with
those obtained using LFV studies carried out by other spectroscopic
techniques. In half of the cases, no previous data was available.
As noted in Table 1, where previous literature was found, similar peak positions were
observed but with different relative intensities. The changes in the
relative intensity can be attributed to the different selection rules
applicable to Raman scattering versus other techniques, as well as
the experimental conditions of each method.

Conclusions
LFV Raman spectroscopy is a promising approach to elucidate the
structural and functional information hidden in the LFV modes of biomolecules,
which in many aspects have thus far not been studied in detail. The
approach we present in this article introduces a step forward in LFV
Raman spectroscopy. Using an experimental setup based on a single-stage
monochromator and volume holographic filters, we were able to obtain
the LFV Raman spectrum of a single amino acid phenylalanine in a hydrated
environment, in contrast to the previous studies on the polycrystalline
form or pressed pellets mixed with PE powder.30,31 We presented LFV Raman measurements for a model amphipathic peptide
made of a combination of two amino acids, lysine and leucine. Furthermore,
using LFV Raman spectroscopy, we were able to distinguish spectroscopically
between truncated IgG (Fab) and its whole molecule counterpart (IgG)
and between methylated and nonmethylated DNA. The range of biomolecules
we examined in this study illustrates the wide applicability of LFV
Raman spectroscopy and the ability of experimental setup to provide
a robust and affordable solution to study biomolecules in the LFV/THz
range. From the viewpoint of biological functions, the current study
can open up exciting frontiers in molecular biology. By providing
a nondestructive, label-free characterization technique with submicron
spatial resolution and three-dimensional scanning capability, LFV
Raman spectroscopy offers a unique analytical tool for the study of
biomolecules.

Materials and Methods
Materials
l-Phenylalanine (>98%) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,
0.1 M, pH = 7.5, Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 50 mg/mL.
BSA fraction V (Roche Life Science) and hen egg white lysozyme (>90%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in PBS to a final
concentration of 50 mg/mL.

The K4L8 peptide
(12-mer; >95%) with the KLLLKLLLKLLK sequence (K and L for lysine
and leucine, respectively) was synthesized by Cellmano Biotech, Ltd.
(Hefei, China). For stock solution, the peptide was dissolved in high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water to a final concentration
of 25 mg/mL, incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT), and stored
at −20° until used. For measurements, the peptide was
diluted to a final concentration of 12.5 mg/mL (in 50% acetonitrile
and 0.05 M HCl), briefly sonicated, and allowed to equilibrate by
60–90 min incubation at RT.

ChromPure Horse IgG whole
molecule and ChromPure Horse IgG (Fab
fragment only) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc. and
diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 50 and 25 mg/mL, respectively.

Methylated (5mC+) and unmethylated (5mC−) short DNA oligonucleotides
with the ATACGCGTAT primary sequence were synthesized by Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT, Belgium). The methylated DNA oligonucleotide
includes two cytosine modifications (ATACCH3GCCH3GTAT) within the CpG motif, representing
the DNA methylation from naturally occurring eukaryotic cells. For
measurements, both DNA oligonucleotides were dissolved in HPLC-grade
water to a final concentration of 6 mg/mL.

Sample Preparation
For LFV Raman measurements, 3 μL
of each sample was spotted onto a glass slide in two consecutive layers.
Between the layers, the samples were allowed to dry completely at
RT. The measurements were carried out at RT (293 K). Reproducibility
of data was checked by repeating each experiment in triplicates using
fresh samples. For every sample, spectra were collected from three
randomly selected areas and averaged. No appreciable variation of
band shapes was noticed in the course of the experiments, indicating
preservation of the sample integrity during the measurements. To estimate
the contribution of the buffer solutions, we measured the LFV Raman
spectrum of HPLC-grade water, PBS, and 50% acetonitrile with 0.05
M HCl in HPLC-grade water. No measurable peaks were obtained for all
of the liquids in the spectral region of interest; this confirms that
the detected signal belongs to the samples alone.

Raman Measurement
Apparatus
The Raman system used in
the measurements is a lab-built apparatus that consists of several
components. A single-mode continuous-wave laser with a wavelength
of λ = 532 nm (Samba, Cobolt) was used to excite the samples
via an upright microscope (BXFM, Olympus) and a long-working-distance
100× objective with a numerical aperture of NA = 0.9 (MPlanFL
WD = 1 mm, Olympus). The Raman filters had a 5 cm–1 transition (BragGrate 532, OptiGrate). In the LFV Raman set-up,
the excitation laser is first reflected off a “clean-up”
bandpass filter (BPF) to remove residual spontaneous emission and
also to direct the beam toward the sample. Three bandpass notch filters
(BNF) then reject the Rayleigh scattering of the laser, with each
BNF providing 3 orders of magnitude of light attenuation. The Raman
signal from the sample is collected in back-scattered geometry. Leaked
light is used to align all of the optics in the collection path. After
alignment is complete, the three BNF filters are used to achieve a
combined 9 orders of magnitude rejection of the laser excitation. Figure 11 shows the schematic
of the system along with the positioning of the filters in the apparatus.
The samples were kept on a computer-controlled motorized stage (SCANplus 100 × 100, Marzhauser Wetzlar), which can maintain
the exact positon below 1 μm resolution. This prevents the possibility
of the drift in the sample position during the measurement. The Raman
signal is collected with a confocal configuration using a 50 μm
diameter fiber to define the confocal pinhole and is spectrally resolved
in a 0.5 m long imaging spectrometer (SP-2500i, Princeton Instruments)
and charge-coupled device (PIXIS 400, Princeton Instruments). The
Raman measurements were carried out using a 1800 grooves/mm grating.
Each spectrum was averaged over five accumulations, for an overall
integration time of 300 s. The laser power at the sample was measured
to be 60 mW. The Raman setup was calibrated using silicon and polystyrene
samples, before carrying out the measurements. All experiments were
conducted at RT (293 K).

filters (BNF1–3)
to reject the Rayleigh scattering by 9 orders of magnitude, clean-up
bandpass filter (BPF) to clean the continuous wave (CW) laser beam,
mirrors (M1-M2), and microscope objective (OB).

Data Analysis
To resolve overlapping bands, the spectra
were processed using PEAKFIT (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) software.
First, second-derivative spectra accompanied by 2% Savitzky–Golay
smoothing were calculated to identify the position of the component
bands. Next, the resulting values (in wavenumbers) were used as initial
parameters for curve fitting with Gaussian component peaks. Finally,
positions, bandwidths, and amplitudes of the peaks were varied until
good agreement between the calculated sum of all components and the
experimental spectra was achieved (r2 >
0.99).
