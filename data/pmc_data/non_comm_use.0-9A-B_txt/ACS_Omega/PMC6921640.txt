The mankind relies on the use of antibiotics for a healthy
life.
The epidemic-like emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains is
increasingly becoming one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality,
which gives rise to design a potential antimicrobial peptide (AMP).
Here, we have designed the potential AMP using the extensive dynamics
simulation since protein–peptide interactions are linked to
large conformational changes. Therefore, we have employed the advanced
computational avenue CABS molecular docking method that enabled the
flexible peptide-protein molecular docking with a large-scale rearrangement
of the protein. Lead AMP was investigated against the wild-type (WT)
and mutant-PBP5 (MT-PBP5) proteins (antiresistance property). AMP20
showed strong interactions with wtPBP5 and mtPBP5 and involvement
of a large number of elements in interactions determined through an
atomic model study. Full flexibility analysis showed the stable interaction
of AMP20 with both the wild-type and mutant form of PBP5 with root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) values of ∼4.51 and 4.85 Å, respectively.
Moreover, peptide dynamics showed involvement of all residues of AMP20
through contact map analysis, and extensive simulation confirmed the
stable interaction of AMP20, with lower values of RMSD, radius of
gyration, and root-mean-square fluctuation. This study paves the way
for a potential approach to design the AMP with amino acid walking
and large-scale conformational rearrangements of amino acids.

Introduction
The humanity relies on the use of antibiotics
for a healthy life.
However, the excessive dependency and blind use and abuse of one of
the discoveries in the field of medicine have led to a situation where
the disease has mastered its antidote.1 From the “golden age of antibacterials”, we are now
heading for a “post-antibiotic era”. The global crisis
of antibiotic resistance is projected to cause a staggering death
toll of one person every 3 s by 2050.2 Among
these “superbugs”, Enterobacteriaceae (a family of Gram-negative
bacteria) poses a major concern3 since
these pathogens are a natural inhabitant of our microbiome. Unfortunately,
in the past two years, only two classes of antibiotics have reached
the market, cyclic lipopeptides and oxazolidinones, and both of these
drugs are inadequate as they only target Gram-positive bacteria.4Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria, is the most predominant facultative anaerobic
species in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals.5 It is usually a harmless microbe, but by acquiring specific
virulent genes, it can cause a number of significant illnesses. Antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains have been reported worldwide.6 Consequently, the development of antibacterial
agents with novel modes of action has become indispensable to combat
drug-resistant E. coli. Antimicrobial
peptides as novel therapeutic agents represent a solution to ward
off evolving pathogens. Hence, we aim to design the potential antimicrobial
peptide (AMP) that can inhibit the bacterial cell wall synthesis by
targeting the penicillin-binding protein (PBP). PBP is majorly responsible
for cell wall biosynthesis by its trans-glycosylation and trans-peptidation.7 Among the different PBPs, PBP-5 is reported to
be conserved with a high-resolution crystal structure (X-ray diffraction
resolution of 1.8 Å).7

With
the advancement of structural biology and computational approaches,
new and innovative methods have been used to derive the potential
peptide, which is rapidly expanding the field of peptide therapeutics
and rational drug design. With the rapid success of peptide-based
therapies and notable advantages over small drug-like specificity,
higher selectivity, low toxicity, and minimal adverse side effects,8−10 antigenic peptides are capable of generating effective immunity
by administration of the antigens along with adjuvants. For an effective
treatment, peptidic antigens or drugs with sustainable delivery system
have shown significant results in medical science.11,12 To develop and design the potential approach to AMP, we have made
a large library of antimicrobial therapeutics with large variations
and diversity using ranalexin (a natural antimicrobial peptide), which
reduces the toxicity and side effects with its nature.13 We have modified the AMPs with (KPCI) amino
acids, reported to be potential residues that enhance the binding
specificity of AMP targeting the antibacterial proteins by replacing
(N, W, V, L, M, F, H, Y, N, E, L, F) and (A, Y, N).14 During the molecular interaction study of protein-peptide,
high flexibility of protein targets and the phenomenon of large-scale
conformational rearrangements of the receptor protein and peptide
ligands occur, which are needed to analyze to study the stability
of an interacting complex.15 Conventionally,
molecular docking is used for the interaction study of peptide sequences.
The commonly used algorithms for molecular docking of protein-peptide
are restricted to the rearrangement and flexibility analysis of peptide
only and ablating the flexibility of the receptor protein.16−20 Hence, we have used the CABS-dock coarse-grained-based approach,
which has been found to be a potential tool for large-scale protein
rearrangements while explicating the peptide docking.21 Molecular docking is an approach to study the binding of
the receptor and ligand molecules based on various computational theoretical
algorithms. The molecular docking approach is widely employed in many
applications including binding studies of target receptors with ligand,
peptide interactions, drug interactions, nanoparticle interaction,
binding mechanism analysis, etc.

In order to design the potential
antibacterial peptide, we have
targeted the PBP5 protein. PBP plays a key role in bacterial wall
biosynthesis.22 It is well known that substitution
in PBP can lead to antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria.23 Gramicidin A, an antimicrobial peptide, is already
a successful antibiotic.24 This area of
research has gained considerable interest.25 Hence, we aimed to design a novel antimicrobial peptide that binds
better with wtPBP and mutated PBP as well. We have also discussed
binding mechanisms with the wild-type and mutant form of PBP5 antibacterial
target. To our best knowledge, the previous studies of designing of
AMP with both forms of PBP5 (wild-type and mutant form) were limited
to regular simulations of the complex and excluding the extensive
dynamics simulation analysis linked to large conformational changes.
Therefore, in this work, we have performed the flexible peptide-protein
molecular docking with a large-scale rearrangement of the protein
chains. Again to our knowledge, amino acid walking (by changing the
amino acids in a large sequence sequentially) has not been pursued.
As we present here, a novel approach that involves the amino acid
walking and their analysis by molecular docking and followed by extensive
simulation of the AMP-PBP5 complex in an explicit docking method were
performed. This particular approach paves the way for the development
of novel antimicrobial peptides against drug-resistant pathogens.

Results and Discussion
Structure Retrieval of Penicillin-Binding Protein 5 and Assessment
PBP5 is the most abundant type of PBP in E. coli and catalyzes the major d-alanine carboxypeptidase activity
in vivo.26 We have retrieved
the crystal structure of wtPBP5 of E. coli (strain K12) from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1NZO). A three-dimensional
(3D) structure was determined by X-ray diffraction study and reported
at a resolution of 1.85 Å. PBP5 was made up of only one chain
(Chain-A) with 363 amino acids. Chain-A of PBP5 was found complexed
with the small molecule named β-mercaptoethanol (for structural
stabilization). The PBP5 structure forms a covalent acyl-enzyme complex
with β-lactam antibiotics.27 The
3D structure was evaluated for its stereochemical and physiochemical
properties. Stereochemical properties were analyzed through Ramachandran
plot assessment using the procheck server. The Ramachandran plot showed
that 91.5% of residues were in most favored regions, 8.2% of residues
were in additional allowed regions, and 0.3% of residues were in generously
allowed regions with no residues in disallowed regions of the protein
structure.

Physiochemical properties were determined by the
Swiss server, and the QMEAN score was calculated to be 0.53, representing
the overall absolute quality of the wtPBP5 structure for the various
properties (solvation energy, torsion angle energy, solvent accessibility,
and atom pairwise energy) (Figure 1). The scores for these particular parameters came
in the region light blue to blue of the QMEAN plot of the wtPBP5 protein
and indicated the good values of the physicochemical properties. Positive
QMEAN values (blue region) indicate that the model scores higher than
experimental structures on average. The white area (light blue) in
the bar plots (numerical values close to zero) indicates that the
property is similar to what one would expect from experimental structures
of a similar size. The accuracy of the assessment was enhanced by
using QMEANDisco. This is consistent with the observation of interatomic
distance in the PBP5 structure with ensembling information from the
experimentally identified protein structures, which were homologs
to the query structure sequence. The local quality plot showed the
similarity of the native structures and reflected to possess a high
quality with a score of more than 0.6, a value that is expected for
high-quality structures. In addition, Errat and Verify3D web interfaces
also confirmed the good quality of the structures. Errat showed that
the structural residues lie under the range error or warning region
of the plot derived from the NMR/X-ray-derived 3D structure database
(Figure 2). The observed
structure was found to be very similar to the expected structures
of databases, as shown in the plot. Verify3D showed that more than
99% of residues have a score of more than 0.2 in the 1D-2D profile
of NMR/X-ray-derived 3D structures.

Three-Dimensional Structure Retrieval of Mutant Penicillin-Binding
Protein 5 and Assessment
Gly105-Asp mutation in PBP5 markedly
impairs deacylation with only minor effects on acylation and abolishes
CPase activity. We have used the Gly105-Asp mtPBP5 structure for mutant
resistance study. The crystal structure of a mutant of penicillin-binding
protein 5 of E. coli (strain K12) was
retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1NJ4). The mutant-type
PBP5 structure was determined by X-ray diffraction study and reported
at a 1.9 Å resolution.27 The mutation
causes conformational changes in the structure. Hence, the structure
was evaluated using the Ramachandran plot and Verify3D servers. Ramachandran
plot assessment showed that 92.6% of residues were in most favored
regions, 7.1% of residues were in additional allowed regions, and
0.3% of residues were in generously allowed regions with no disallowed
regions of the mutant-type PBP5 protein structure. The mtPBP5 structure
was also found similar to the expected structure, defined on the basis
of NMR-based known structures (Figure S1). Verify3D showed that more than 99% of residues of the mtPBP5 structure
have a score of more than 0.2 in the 1D-2D profile of NMR/X-ray-derived
3D structures, also shown in Figure S2.

Molecular Docking Analyses of the AMP Library with PBP5
The designed library was docked with the target protein PBP5 using
the ClusPro molecular docking interface. The prepared target receptor
PBP5 protein was uploaded, and its unstructured terminal residues
were removed, and then ligands (designed AMP library) were uploaded.
The ClusPro server works using a piper rigid body molecular docking
algorithm and helps in ligand rotation with 70,000 rotations at all
grid points (X, Y, and Z) about the target protein with a spacing width of 1.0 Å. Then,
using the clustering techniques to find near-native conformations
along with eliminating the non-native clusters, the 1000 best energy
conformations with the lowest score were clustered, and among them,
the 30 largest clusters were refined by minimizing the Charmm energy
of the complexes. The clustering of the poses starts with the lowest
energy pose and grouping all poses within 9 Å. The results showed
that AMP20 has a minimum free energy with a weighted lowest energy
score of −845.2 kcal/mol both in the center and to the whole
structure, among the whole library. AMP20 was found to form strong
interactions with PBP5 with hydrogen bond of 3.02 Å bond length
between Cys14 (position SG) of AMP20 and Asp175 (position OD2) of
the PBP5 target protein and strong hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3). Fifteen residues
of PBP5 were found to be involved in strong hydrophobic interactions
with AMP20 in three regions. AMP20 binding regions at PBP5 were as
follows: first region (26–41) with involved residues Asn26,
Ser27, Gly28, Lys29, and Gly41; second region (140–174) with
involved residues Leu140, Gln170, and Arg174; and third region (297–345)
with involved residues Tyr297, Val328, and Pro345 (Figure 4). Furthermore, to validate
our results, comparative analyses were performed on lead AMP20 with
a known antimicrobial peptide, ranalexin (as discussed in the Introduction). ClusPro resulted in docking scores
of −719.1 and −732.4 kcal/mol for the center and lowest
binding energy scores for RN, respectively, which are lower scores
than AMP20. These results confirmed the potency of our designed AMP20
with higher binding with the target protein PBP5 (Table 1).

Bacterial Resistance Study of AMP20 with Mutant PBP5 Protein
Bacterial resistance study of the lead peptide (AMP20) was performed
by molecular docking with mutant PBP5. A mutant form of the PBP5 protein
is reported to have bacterial resistance. AMP20 was docked using the
ClusPro program, with the same protocol given above. Interaction analyses
of AMP20 showed that it has a very strong interaction with the mutant
form of PBP5 as well, with a binding energy score of −759 kcal/mol.
It has a strong interaction with mtPBP5 with three hydrogen bonds
of less than 3 Å bond length and strong hydrophobic interactions.
Hydrogen bonds were found between Cys20 (oxygen atom) of AMP20 and
Arg198 (amino position NH1) of 2.78 Å bond length, Ile13 (oxygen
atom) of AMP20 with Asn112 (position ND2) of 2.65 Å bond length,
and Gly30 (oxygen atom) of AMP20 with His151 (position NE2) of 2.87
Å bond length. A total of 14 residues of PBP5 were found to be
involved in hydrophobic interactions with AMP20. It was found to bind
at three regions: first region (73–113) with involved residues
Asn73, Met89, Phe90, Gly111, Asp113, and Gln126; second region (150−162)
with involved residues Leu153 and Asp154; and third region (197–216)
with involved residues Asn197, Gly200, His216, and Arg248 (Figure S3). To compare the results, we have also
docked the known antimicrobial peptide ranalexin (RN) with mtPBP5,
which resulted in a lower binding score (−585.5 kcal/mol) than
AMP20 (Table 2 and Figure 5) and weak hydrophobic
interactions with only two hydrogen bonds between Ala15 of AMP20 and
Arg174 (amino position NE) of 3.01 Å bond length and Lys18 of
AMP20 and Arg174 (amino position NH2) of 2.67 Å bond
length (Figure S4).

hydrogen bonds.

Full Flexibility Analysis of the AMP20-PBP5 Complex
The CABS-dock program was employed to perform the molecular dynamics
simulation to analyze the interaction sites, allowing the full flexibility
of the AMP20 peptide to the target protein backbone (Figure 6). The 3D structures of the
PBP5 receptor and the peptide sequence (AMP20) were given as input
files for CABS simulation. The CABS-dock server followed the multistage
protocol that consists of multiple programs and associating scripts
with the CABS model. The whole procedure involved the flexible docking
by the CABS algorithm and the initial filtering of probable solutions
from all generated models and a further selection of representative
models by the clustering protocol and reconstruction to the all-atom
representation of the AMP20-PBP5 complex and further local optimization
of final models.

Figure 6 CABS-dock energy-based top-ranked models obtained for
AMP20-PBP5
in the CABS-dock energy graph for top 10 models (shown in different
colors). The marker (Model 1) indicates the best model produced in
the simulation studies, where the peptide binds close to the PBP5
protein receptor in an open flexible conformation.

Conformation flexibility analyses of interactions
were the key
properties of protein interaction systems for biological function.
Flexibility analysis of the AMP20-PBP5 system was performed through
near-native dynamics for 10 ns MD simulations (all-atom, explicit
water, for all protein metafolds using the four most popular force
fields) using the CABS model. The AMP20 peptide was studied for its
rearrangement and flexibility analyses for 50 Monte Carlo simulation
cycles. CABS used the well-established coarse-grained protein simulation.
The CABS force field included the knowledge-based statistical potentials
(sequence-dependent short-range conformational preferences, context-dependent
potential of pairwise interactions of side chains, and model of the
main chain hydrogen bonds) accounting for the solvent effect in an
implicit fashion. The complex system was simulated by a random series
of small local moves (controlled by a Monte Carlo scheme) whose long-term
evolution describes the protein dynamics. The resulting 10,000 models,
during the simulation, up to 1000 models were selected for further
steps through all unbound states, where the interaction energy between
the peptide and the receptor was zero, and from the remaining 100
models, top 10 trajectories were picked by the lowest interaction
energy of AMP20-PBP5 models.

Among the top models, cluster 1
resulted in specific and flexible
interactions with a large number of elements (number of models grouped
in a cluster) of 127 and an average RMSD (root–mean-square
deviation) (average pairwise Cα RMSD value between models grouped
in a cluster) of 4.51 Å with a cluster density (the number of
elements divided by average cluster RMSD) of 28.115. During the docking
simulation, residues Lys294, Val347, Pro345, Val328, Lys29, Gly28,
Leu167, Gly141, Gln170, Leu140, Ser27, Asn26, Arg174, Tyr297, and
Tyr25 were found to bind AMP20 with the significant flexibility of
the PBP5 protein. Moreover, four clusters of AMP20 were found to bind
in the proximity of the binding grooves of PBP5 with strong interactions,
in the range of less than 3 Å, with a buried area of the complex
of 2047.9 Å2. The critical binding analyses of these
clusters elucidate the binding sites of PBP5 by reconstructing the
complex system and showed that all residues of AMP20 (cluster 1) are
involved in the interaction with PBP5.

Thereafter, we have analyzed
the AMP20 flexibility binding analysis
with mtPBP5. The top model resulted in specific and flexible interactions
with a large number of elements of 103 and an average RMSD of 4.80
Å with a cluster density of 21.453. All top-ranked clusters showed
the strong interaction of AMP20 to the closed vicinity of PBP5, except
for cluster 5 and cluster 8. Notably, the mtPBP5 protein resulted
in conformational structural changes; hence, AMP20 binds to the slightly
different region to PBP5, particularly at the center for residues
Arg248, Asn197, Gly200, His216, Gln126, Lys84, Asn73, Gln111, Asp113,
Met89, Phe90, Ser87, Leu153, and Asp154 of PBP5. Here, we found the
efficient binding of AMP20 and that this approach provides a potential
method to define the binding site of the target protein through flexibility
rearrangement simulation studies. Our results showed the flexibility
of peptide, with binding to target, the phenomenon is known as conformational
selection for molecular recognition of peptide.

Contact Map Analysis
The molecular interactions of
AMP20 with PBP5 were analyzed using the contact map analysis using
the CABS simulation program. We determined the intermolecular protein-peptide
contacts focusing on the dynamics of the PBP5 protein to define the
part of the protein, most prominent for interaction with AMP20. The
contact map showed that the different regions of PBP5, that is, 26–32,
52–60, 136–140, 174–175, 295–299, 327–330,
and 341–344, were involved in the interaction in close proximity
with AMP20 (bond length of 4.5 Å). Observed contact maps are
presented in Figure 7. Similarly, contact map analysis was performed for mtPBP5 interaction
with lead AMP20. For the mtPBP5 protein, regions 84–90, 110–116,
151–154, 198–216, and 248–249 were found in close
contact with AMP20, with a bond length of 4.5 Å. Notably, residues
Ala139 and Gln56 of wtPBP5 and residues Asn112 and Arg198 of mtPBP5
were found to be the most conserved residues involved in the interaction
of a complex in a bond length of 3.0 Å.

Peptide Dynamics
We have used the intraprotein contact
maps and root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) average values over simulation
trajectories to qualitatively analyze the dynamics of the flexible
AMP20-PBP5 complex system. The RMSF plot showed the very mild fluctuations
in amino acid side chains, which reflect the uninterrupted interaction
between the ligand and receptor, whereas a small region (81–84
and 271–273 residues of PBP5) in the plot indicated the highly
flexible regions in the complex (Figure 8). Higher peaks at the terminal regions of
PBP5 showed that it undergoes through significant conformational changes
with high fluctuations. Overall, RMSF values lying in the range of
1–3 Å indicated the stable binding of the AMP20. AMP20
with mild fluctuations formed the different arrangements in the proximity
of the binding site of the protein PBP5. A similar conclusion to simulation
studies can be drawn from the contact map obtained.

values over the trajectory from the CABS-dock simulation (blue line).
Fluctuation run shows the consistent flexible interaction, with a
small flexible region at residues 81–84 and 271–273.

AMP20-PBP5 Complex System Dynamics
In addition to the
flexibility analysis of the complex system using CABS and AMP20 peptide
dynamics study, we have confirmed our results with regular molecular
dynamics simulation using an NAMD full setup program through the MDWeb
interface. After the simulation run of 100 ps, a stable trajectory
complex system was observed. The whole process of simulation included
the cleaning of a complex structure, fixing of side chains, the addition
of hydrogen atoms, neutralization, the addition of a solvent box,
and minimization and equilibration of the system to finally achieve
the structure prepared by simulation. The equilibration of the system
also included heating the solvent to 300 K and reducing the restraints
to just the protein backbone. These steps were carried out to provide
the structure with the necessary conditions to study its dynamics
along a span of time. Once the structure was prepared, the water molecules
in it were removed to reduce the size of the system to achieve the
dry trajectory for plotting various graphs for the analysis of the
simulated complex structure. The RMSD values were assessed and showed
the low deviation within a range of ∼0.15 to ∼0.0601.2
Å in a very similar pattern for the peptide bound to the whole
PBP5 sequence during the molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ps time
length, which indicates the stability of the AMP20-wtPBP5 complex.
All-atom interactions were used to identify the protein complex conformational
changes due to isotopic crystallographic B factors. RMSD analysis
showed the stable and strong interaction between the AMP20 and the
target PBP5 protein as the quality assessment criteria are based on
ligand RMSD between the predicted model and the experimental peptide
structure after superimposition of the receptor molecules. Moreover,
the atomic fluctuation (B factor) and movement of the residues of
the complex system were assessed. Atomic fluctuation measures the
mobility of the backbone atoms of the system in the dynamics of the
complex. We observed the minimal variations to the corresponding binding
region of the AMP20 to PBP5, as shown in Figure 9. The atomic fluctuation profile for the
binding region was found to be in the range of ∼1 to ∼8
Å, except at two regions (198–201 and 290–296)
of PBP5. This indicated the lesser fluctuation per residues of the
protein complex contributing to the protein stability of the complex.

(C) Radius of gyration plot investigation showing the compactness
of the protein complex till 10 snapshots. The compactness of protein
receptor increased till nine snapshots during the simulation.

The compactness of the protein complex was also
calculated by the
radius of gyration (Rg) plot. Rg analysis showed that the complex
had a slightly fluctuating Rg in the range of 23.42–23.47 Å
and then it gets stabilized with an average Rg score of 23.4689 Å,
lower values than the trajectory analysis of wtPBP5 (23.5338 Å).
These conformational rearrangements of compactness of the AMP20-PBP5
complex system indicate the flexible interaction with the most favored
conformation of AMP20 to the binding grove of PBP5. Furthermore, we
have analyzed the interaction stability of AMP20 with mtPBP5 and showed
the stable binding of the AMP20-mtPBP5 system with minimal deviation
in values of RMSD and RMSF (Supporting Information). These outcomes evidently showed the dynamic nature of the AMP20
ensemble.

Physicochemical Analysis of AMP Constructs
Various
physicochemical properties of the lead antibacterial peptide (AMP20)
were calculated using the ProtParam server. It uses an amino acid
sequence of the peptide construct for analysis. The molecular weight
of the construct was calculated to be 2.137 kDa and, the number of
atoms was 315, which shows that the construct has good antigenic properties.
Further analysis showed that AMP20 has a pI (isoelectric point) value
of 9.11, which indicates that the peptide construct is slightly basic
in nature with a charge of +3. AMP20 fulfills the criteria for the
potential antimicrobial peptide since it possesses the characteristic
properties reported for effective antimicrobial peptides (short length,
12–50 amino acid residues long; positively charged, net charge
of +2 to +9; and amphipathic nature).28 The estimated half-life for AMP20 was computed to be 1.1 h in mammalian
reticulocyte, and the instability index was 14.18, which signified
the stability of the peptide. The estimated aliphatic index was 131.50,
which indicated that the protein is thermostable, and proteins with
a high value of aliphatic index represent thermostability. Moreover,
the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was calculated to be 1.435;
a positive value indicated that the protein is hydrophobic in nature
and it can cross the cell membrane and also be passed through the
hydrophobic layers.

Secondary Structure Analysis
The secondary structure
of the lead AMP20 construct was predicted from the online server SOPMA.
It predicts the secondary structure on the basis of the amino acid
sequence of the 511 proteins in the databases. Overall, the secondary
structure prediction result showed that the α-helices contents
were 65.00%, extended strands (β sheets) were 20.00%, and random
coils were 15.00% (Figure 10).

of the AMP20 structure within the favored (94.1% of residues) and
allowed (5.9% of residues) regions with no residues in the outlier
region. (C) Secondary structure analysis of the peptide.

Peptide Tertiary Structure Refinement
The predicted
tertiary (3D) structure of antimicrobial construct (AMP20) was further
processed using the GalaxyRefine server for model refinement. GalaxyRefine
generated five models after refinement, out of which Model 1 was selected
with its stable structural properties. Also, GDT-HA was calculated
to be 0.9625, while RMSD, MolProbity, clash score, and poor rotamers
were calculated to be 0.0663, 1.346, 6.3, and 0.0, respectively. Model
1 was found to be the best-refined model after comparison of different
scores of it with remaining models (Table S1). Moreover, the Ramachandran plot was also evaluated to assess the
phi and psi angle conformations, where we found that 94.1% of residues
are in the favored region and 5.9% of residues are in the allowed
region of the three-dimensional structure.

Allergenicity Analysis of AMP
Allergenicity is an important
characteristic property of an effective antimicrobial peptide. An
allergen molecule can induce the overreaction to the immune system.
Hence, AMP20 was evaluated and found as a non-allergen. Non-alleregenicty
of AMP20 was identified on the basis of several descriptors including
the size, hydrophobicity, helix contents, and β-strand forming
propensities. The AMP20 peptide string was transformed into uniform
vectors by cross-covariance with a machine learning method and classified
as a non-allergen.29

Conclusions
Herein, we have designed the AMP targeting
PBP5 (a potential antibacterial
target protein), both the wild-type and mutant form are responsible
for bacterial resistance, using the CABS-dock methods. Amino acid
walking and extensive simulation dynamics studies were performed on
the AMP-PBP5 complex for large-scale conformational rearrangements.
For potential AMP determination, a large library was designed. In
order to enhance the diversity and specificity of the AMP library,
we have incorporated the potential amino acids (KPCI) and followed
the amino acid walking approach. The obtained large library was evaluated
by using the molecular docking, which showed that the AMP20 has the
highest binding free energy score of −845.2 kcal/mol. Lead
AMP20 was found to possess a strong interaction with potential hydrogen
bonds and hydrophobic forces. In one of the recent computational studies,
where AMP was designed, however, they have performed only molecular
docking and did not involve molecular simulation analysis,30 overcoming the issues we have employing the
extensive molecular dynamics simulation studies with refining the
approach for designing the potential AMP with the larger flexibility
of the protein. Many reports suggested the use of molecular dynamics
simulation studies to design the potent AMP with stable and consistent
interaction with the target protein. CABS-dock, a coarse-grained simulation
method, was employed for large-scale PBP5 protein motion during an
explicit designed AMP study. During the interaction study, full flexibility
of ligand peptide structures and large-scale flexibility of the AMP-receptor
protein structure with involvement of elements were analyzed.

The large-scale conformational rearrangement analysis of the AMP20-PBP5
complex showed that the accuracy of the best model is 4.51 Å
with the involvement of 127 elements in the interactions and resulted
in the improved model quality using the all-atom refinement. Moreover,
the molecular dynamics simulation analyses confirmed the importance
of various amino acids in the binding of AMP20 with the target PBP5.
To our best knowledge, AMP identification with close binding to PBP5
has not been reported with large conformation flexibility studies
and contact map analysis. The full flexibility analysis resulted in
the stable binding of the lead peptide (AMP20) with wtPBP5 and mtPBP5
proteins with lower RMSD values of ∼4.51 and 4.85 Å, respectively,
and suggested the high potency of the AMP against the target antibacterial
protein. Contact maps were employed to study the peptide dynamics,
and it showed the involvement of all amino acids of AMP20 in the interaction
with the target PBP5. Moreover, our results were supported by the
optimal physicochemical properties with the non-allergen characteristic
of the AMP20. In conclusion, our approach helped in designing the
potential AMP by studying its binding dynamics and side-chain fluctuation
to the large-scale flexibility of the target wild-type and mutant
PBP receptor protein. The designed AMP with molecular modeling studies,
including molecular docking, dynamics simulation, and large-scale
rearrangement/flexibility studies, confirmed the target specificity,
which will restrict the nonspecific binding and result in reduced
side effects. The present study provides an effective computational
approach to design the AMP with amino acid walking and large-scale
rearrangements of the protein using the CABS-dock.

Materials and Methods
Structure Retrieval and Assessment of PBP5 (Wild-Type and Mutant
Form)
PBP5 of E. coli functions
as d-alanine carboxypeptidase (CPase) activity, cleaving d-alanine from the C terminus of the cell wall of peptides.
Like all PBPs, PBP5 forms a covalent acyl-enzyme complex with a β-lactam
antibiotic. Importantly, PBP5 is distinguished by its high rate of
deacylation of the acyl-enzyme complex (t(1/2) of
approximately 10 min).27 We have retrieved
and assessed the crystal structures of the wtPBP5 and mtPBP5 of E. coli from the Protein Data Bank.

Designing of AMP Library by the Amino Acid Walking Approach
AMPs are essential components of the innate immune system and produced
by all classes of life from prokaryotes to mammalians to protect themselves
against invasion by microbial pathogens.31,32 Hence, a large library of AMPs was designed by using the computational
approaches that have attributed to potential avenues for therapeutic
AMP development with high diversity. We have taken naturally occurring
AMP ranalexin (FLGGLIKIVPAMICAVTKKC) to modify and design the large
library of AMPs. It is reported that one of the potential strategies
to develop new antimicrobial peptides is to modify the template sequence
of naturally occurring peptides and enhancing their activity.13 We have modified the ranaxelin antimicrobial
peptide by inserting the potential amino acids (K, P, C, and I) at
different positions. Amino acids (K, P, C, and I) have been reported
to enhance the binding specificity of AMP and possess the compositional
importance for designing the potential AMPs. We have replaced the
(N, W, V, L, M, F, H, Y, N, E, L, F) and (A, Y, N) amino acids with
(KPCI) since these were reported to be less important in designing
the antibacterial peptides.14 We have employed
the peptide walking approach to the target peptide by incorporating
K, P, C, and I amino acids to the ranaxelin peptide to sequentially
form the 5′ to 3′ order at every position to make the
library diverse and specific to the target protein PBP5. The designed AMP library
was analyzed through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation
and advanced peptide approaches including CABS.

Molecular Docking Analyses
Molecular docking analysis
of the designed library was performed using the ClusPro protein-peptide
docking program.33 The ClusPro suite works
on the basis of fast Fourier transformation to determine the lowest
binding energy conformation by analyzing the semidefinite program
for the protein receptor–ligand complex and also refined the
stable interaction cluster by using the Monte Carlo simulations.34 The designed library of peptides was studied
against both wild-type and mutant PBP5 in order to optimize the efficiency
of lead AMP for bacterial resistance. The docked complex of PBP5-lead
AMP with the lowest binding energy was selected and studied for involved
molecular interaction using the Ligplot+ (v.1.4.5) module. Ligplot
determines the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions of the
complex system.35

Full Flexibility Analysis of Lead AMP with Both Wild-Type and
Mutant PBP5
CABS-dock (http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock/), a coarse-grained simulation method, was employed for large-scale
PBP5 protein motion during an explicit designed AMP study since large
structural changes in a protein target in a molecular docking approach
are the requisite parameters for classical modeling servers.15,36−38 During the interaction study, the CABS method involves
the full flexibility of ligand peptide structures and large-scale
flexibility of the protein structure to the binding site. CABS has
been used extensively in wide applications, including the elucidation
of binding mechanism, peptide dynamics, and folding assessment of
the proteins and structure conformational studies.39−46

Peptide Dynamics and Molecular Dynamics Studies of the Complex
Molecular dynamics and stability of AMP20 with wtPBP5 and mtPBP5
were studied using the MDWeb program. MDWeb determines the root-mean-square
deviation and atomic fluctuations of the interacting complex by scrutinizing
the stable binding trajectories.47 An NAMD
full molecular dynamics setup was employed for carrying out the atomic
fluctuation analyses, and the resulting dry trajectory was analyzed
to determine the RMSD and atomic fluctuations.

Physicochemical Properties Analysis of Lead AMP Constructs
Shortlisted AMP from the large library through CABS and molecular
dynamics study was studied for its physicochemical properties using
the ProtParam server.48 The structural
stability of the lead AMP was analyzed by studying its secondary and
tertiary structure conformations. The 3D structure of the construct
was also analyzed using the GalaxyRefine server49 for model refinement and also evaluated its Ramachandran
plot to assess the stereochemical properties and favorable conformations.
In addition to stability, allergenicity was also analyzed for the
lead AMP since an allergen molecule can induce the overreaction to
the immune system.
