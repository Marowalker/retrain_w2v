Delivery across the cell membrane is of critical importance for the development of therapeutics
targeting intracellular proteins. The use of cell-penetrating peptides
(CPPs), such as Penetratin (P16), has facilitated the delivery of
otherwise cell-impermeable molecules allowing them to carry out their
biological function. A truncated form of Penetratin (RRMKWKK) has
been previously described as the minimal Penetratin sequence that
is required for translocation across the cell membrane. Here, we performed
a detailed comparison of cellular uptake by Penetratin (P16) and the
truncated Penetratin peptide (P7), including their ability to deliver
G7-18NATE, a cyclic peptide targeting the cytosolic cancer target
Grb7-adapter protein into cells. We identified that both P16 and P7
were internalized by cells to comparable levels; however, only P16
was effective in delivering G7-18NATE to produce a biological response.
Live-cell imaging of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peptides suggested
that while P7 may be taken up into cells, it does not gain access
to the cytosolic compartment. Thus, this study has identified that
the P7 peptide is a poor CPP for the delivery of G7-18NATE and may
also be insufficient for the intracellular delivery of other bioactive
molecules.

Introduction
Extensive progress has been made toward
the development of biological
agents targeted to intracellular protein–protein interfaces,
as either tools for elucidating biochemical pathways or potential
therapeutics.1,2 Compared with small-molecule inhibitors,
peptidic or oligonucleotide-based inhibitors show superior ability
to selectively and potently bind to their targets. A shortcoming,
however, is their general inability to diffuse across cellular membranes
to reach their intracellular target. This was a major obstacle to
the use of these molecules until the discovery of cell-penetrating
peptides (CPPs).3 CPPs are a group of short
peptides, ranging from 8 to 30 amino acids that can readily translocate
the cell membrane and deliver covalently or noncovalently bound functional
biomolecules that would otherwise be cell-impermeable. Their entry
into cells is facilitated by their predominantly hydrophobic character
and, in some cases, their positive charge that allows for direct interactions
with the lipid bilayer.3 Their uptake mechanism
is thought to involve a combination of direct permeation and endocytotic
mechanisms depending on many factors, including the nature of the
cargo, the cell type, the peptide concentration, the incubation time,
and the CPP itself.3,4 Cargos that have been efficiently
delivered into the cytosol include proteins,5,6 peptides,7,8 and siRNA.9,10 The efficient delivery of biologically
active cargo by CPPs has thus opened up a major field of endeavor
in biology as well as the possibility of developing biologic therapeutics
against intracellular targets.

The first CPPs identified were
found in naturally occurring proteins,
including the HIV tat trans-activator protein and the Drosphilia Antennapedia homeodomain.11−13 The 60-residue Antennapedia homeodomain
was found to penetrate cells and induce strong morphological differentiation
when added to a cell medium.13 Subsequent
studies narrowed down the sequence required for the translocation
action to be residues 43–58 of the third α-helix of the
homeodomain.14 This 16-amino-acid sequence,
RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK, was named Penetratin (P16). In a follow-up study,
a series of truncations was made to P16, leading to the identification
of a shortened seven-residue peptide (residues 52–58; RRMKWKK,
P7) as the minimal sequence that is required for cellular uptake.15 The P7 peptide sequence was internalized, albeit
with decreased efficiency compared to the full-length 16-residue sequence
(∼60%). Because of the ease of synthesis of a smaller peptide,
this shortened CPP makes for an attractive peptide for the delivery
of cargo for therapeutic applications.

In our laboratory, we
have investigated an 11-residue cyclic peptide
inhibitor, G7-18NATE, that targets the signaling adaptor protein—growth
factor receptor bound protein 7 (Grb7). This signaling adaptor protein
is a promising intracellular therapeutic target due to its overexpression
in a large number of cancers, including breast, pancreatic, ovarian,
esophageal, and gastric cancers.16−20 Grb7 propagates signals from phosphorylated tyrosine
kinases, such as HER2, HER3, and FAK, to promote migration, invasion,
proliferation, and growth.17,21−24 Grb7 binds to these upstream signaling partners via its C-terminal
SH2 domain. Thus, it is this domain that the nonphosphorylated cyclic
peptide G7-18NATE is targeted to, inhibiting the interactions of Grb7
with HER2, HER3, and FAK.17,25

To deliver G7-18NATE
across the plasma membrane, G7-18NATE has
been covalently linked to either of two CPPs, Tat or P16.17,26 The CPPs were both effective in delivering G7-18NATE to the cytosol
to inhibit Grb7 and effect a biological response. In HER2+ breast
cancer cells, both G7-18NATE-P16 and G7-18NATE-Tat inhibited cell
proliferation with EC50 values of approximately 8 and 50
μM, respectively, and G7-18NATE-P16 also displayed synergistic
antiproliferative effects with the HER2 targeting molecules, doxorubicin
and trastuzumab (herceptin).27 In pancreatic
and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells that overexpress Grb7,
migration was shown to be significantly reduced following treatment
with 10 μM G7-18NATE-P16, and in a pancreatic cancer mouse xenograft
model, tumor growth and metastasis were significantly inhibited by
G7-18NATE-P16 treatment.17,26

In an effort
to create the minimal bioactive construct, we hypothesized
that G7-18NATE could be conjugated to P7 for successful delivery to
its Grb7 target in cells. In an earlier work using confocal microscopy
imaging of fluorescent streptavidin, it appeared that such a biotin-labeled
G7-18NATE-P7 construct efficiently co-localized with Grb7 in the cytosol.28 Whether or not P7 could effectively deliver
G7-18NATE to exert its biological activity was not investigated, which
thus forms the basis of the study presented here.

Hence, we
have investigated the effectiveness of the P7 peptide
as a CPP for the cellular delivery of the G7-18NATE cargo in comparison
to P16. Consistent with the original report, we have identified that
biotinylated versions of the P16 and P7 peptides are internalized
by cells to a similar extent. However, despite this apparent cellular
internalization, only P16 was able to successfully deliver the G7-18NATE
cargo to its target and achieve a biological response. We determined
that this was unlikely to be due to the negative effects of the P7
peptide on Grb7-SH2 domain binding. Instead, we discovered that while
P16 could effectively reach both the cytosol and nucleus of live TNBC
cells, the P7 peptide did not permeate throughout these intracellular
compartments and was potentially trapped in endosomes. Hence, we have
identified that the truncated Penetratin sequence is insufficient
to mediate the delivery of the G7-18NATE peptide to its intracellular
cytosolic target. This study has important implications for the use
of the shortened Penetratin delivery sequence as a delivery vehicle,
for not only G7-18NATE but also all bioactive molecules that are being
developed to target intracellular proteins.

Results
P16 and P7
Delivery Sequences Appear To Be Internalized at Comparable
Levels
It has been previously reported that the C-terminal
seven residues of Penetratin (P7) constitute the minimal sequence
required for internalization through the plasma membrane.15 To investigate this further, we utilized the
same experimental assay as originally used to identify this peptide:
a peptide internalization assay that detects the presence of biotinylated
peptide via treatment of cell lysate with streptavidin-linked alkaline
phosphatase, which is then quantified by the color produced by the
enzymatic degradation of p-nitrophenol phosphate
to p-nitrophenol. Both the full-length Penetratin
(P16) and the C-terminal seven residues of Penetratin (P7) were synthesized
with an N-terminal biotin group (see Figure 1 for a complete list of peptides utilized
in this study).

Figure 1 Schematic of peptides tested in this study. Sequences
of P16 and
P7 and the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) are shown in amino
acid single-letter codes. Symbols B, F, and G represent the biotin,
the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and the bioactive G7-18NATE
peptide cargoes, respectively. The cargo chemical structures are shown
with the attachment point to the CPP indicated by an orange asterisk.

We determined that, similar to
previous findings, there was no
significant difference in the level of intracellular biotin when HeLa
cells were incubated with either Biotin-P16 or Biotin-P7, as determined
by the absorbance at 405 nm (Figure 2). Because of the correlation between absorbance and
internalized peptide, this assay suggested that both the Biotin-P16
and the Biotin-P7 were able to traverse the cell membrane with similar
efficiency.

Figure 2 Cell internalization of biotin-labeled P16 and P7. HeLa cells were
treated with either Biotin-P16 or Biotin-P7 (at 1 μM) for 15
min. The amount of internalized peptide was quantified by absorbance
at 405 nm, as described in the Methods section.
Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (n = 3).

P7 Is Unable to Deliver
the G7-18NATE Peptide Cargo
We next sought to determine whether
the delivery sequences were equivalent
in their ability to deliver a cargo to the cytosol. We thus prepared
constructs, G7-18NATE-P16 and G7-18NATE-P7, in which P16 or P7 were
synthesized C-terminal to G7-18NATE, the Grb7 targeting inhibitor
(Figure 1). We conducted
wound-healing migration assays using a TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231)
and a nonmalignant breast epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) to compare
the ability of the peptides to decelerate cell migration, as shown
previously for G7-18NATE-P16.26 The level
of inhibition was determined by comparing the cell-free area (at 12
h) between untreated and peptide-treated cells.

Consistent with
previous reports, G7-18NATE-P16 lowered the rate of migration of the
MDA-MB-231 cells by 41% compared to that of the untreated cells, whereas
the P16 control did not decrease the rate of migration (Figure 3A,B). This demonstrated the
ability of the P16 sequence to efficiently deliver the bioactive cargo
to produce a functional inhibitory response in vivo. In contrast,
when the G7-18NATE peptide was conjugated to the P7 sequence, the
inhibitory effects of G7-18NATE were abolished (Figure 3A,B). The G7-18NATE-P7 construct had no effect
on the rate of Grb7-induced cell migration.

Figure 3 Wound-closure migration
assay to determine the effect of Grb7 targeting
peptides on cell migration. A cell-free gap was created in a confluent
well of cells, and the movement of the cells was monitored in real-time,
with images captured every 30 min for a 12 h period (cells maintained
at 37 °C, 5% CO2). The peptides (P16, G7-18NATE-P16,
and G7-18NATE-P7) were added to the cell medium along with 1 ng.mL–1 epidermal growth factor (EGF). The remaining cell-free
gap was measured using ImageJ and normalized, with 100% representing
the movement of untreated cells. The error bars displayed indicate
the standard error of the mean (n ≥ 3), with
each data point also displayed. (A) Representative cell images, (B)
MDA-MB-231 cells, and (C) MCF-10A cells.

Likewise, we found that G7-18NATE-P7 was unable to inhibit
Grb7-mediated
cell migration of MCF-10A cells (Figure 3A,C). In contrast, the effector peptide,
G7-18NATE-P16, showed a 50% decrease in the migration rate compared
to that of the untreated cells. Hence, in two separate cell lines,
G7-18NATE-P16 but not G7-18NATE-P7 was effective at inhibiting migration.

P7 Does Not Negatively Interfere with Binding of G7-18NATE to
Its Grb7-SH2 Target
To check that the lack of activity seen
for G7-18NATE-P7 was not due to an inadvertent effect on its ability
to bind to its intracellular target Grb7, we tested whether the two
constructs could still bind to the Grb7-SH2 domain in vitro. For this,
we used a Thermofluor-based thermal shift assay, which indicates ligand
binding through the increased melting temperature of the target protein.
The G7-18NATE peptides were incubated with both the Grb7-SH2 and the
fluorophore Sypro Orange (which binds to the exposed hydrophobic regions).
The temperature was increased incrementally, and the melting point
of Grb7-SH2 was determined on the basis of the midpoint of the change
in fluorescence intensity.

As displayed in Figure 4 and Table 1, G7-18NATE, G7-18NATE-P16, and G7-18NATE-P7
all bound to the Grb7-SH2 as indicated by an increased melting temperature
of Grb7-SH2 (by 0.80, 0.74, and 1.80 °C, respectively). Representative
unfolding curves are displayed in Figure 4, illustrating the way in which the unfolding
curve is shifted upon addition of a 50 μM peptide. This is consistent
with the binding of a biotin-labeled version of G7-18NATE-P7 previously
shown by ITC to bind with an affinity of KD = 14.4 μM.28 Together, this shows
that the attachment of either P16 or P7 does not negatively affect
the binding of G7-18NATE to the Grb7-SH2 target.

determine the effect of peptides on the melting
temperature of Grb7-SH2. The melting temperature of Grb7-SH2 was determined
on the basis of the fluorescence intensity of the Thermofluor Sypro
Orange in the absence or presence of peptide (G7-18NATE, G7-18NATE-P16,
and G7-18NATE-P7). Representative unfolding curves with the fluorescent
signal normalized to 100 and 0% on the basis of the experimentally
determined maximum and minimum intensities, respectively.

P7 Does Not Reach the Cytosol
We thus speculated that
the P7 peptide had the capacity to enter cells but not to deliver
cargo fully into the cytosol of the cell. We therefore designed P16
and P7 constructs with an N-terminal FITC that would allow us to visualize
the entry of the FITC-labeled peptides into live cells. To indicate
cytosolic delivery, we also incorporated the NLS PKKKRKV so that only
peptides that were successfully delivered into the cytosol would be
able to be transported (by importin-α) into the nucleus of the
cell.

The P16 and P7 peptides (with a FITC label at the N-terminus
and an NLS sequence at the C-terminus) were synthesized and introduced
to live MDA-MB-231 cells at 20 μM. As shown in Figure 5, after treating the cells
for 20 min, FITC-P16-NLS was diffuse throughout the cytosol and nucleus,
indicating that the peptide successfully reached the cytosol and was
efficiently trafficked to the nucleus. In contrast, FITC-P7-NLS could
only be seen sporadically in punctate structures in the cell. Furthermore,
the fluorescence intensity was significantly diminished compared to
that of the longer construct, suggesting limited retention of the
internalized peptide or reduced fluorescence output due to a lower-pH
environment. Both explanations would be consistent with an endosomal
compartmentalization of the FITC-P7-NLS peptide. The fluorescently
labeled NLS (FITC-NLS) control peptide was not observed in either
the cytosol or the nucleus, confirming that this peptide was not internalized
through the cell membrane to any observable extent. Thus, only the
P16 sequence, and not the P7 sequence, was successfully delivered
to the cytosol of the cell.

Figure 5 P16 peptide is efficiently internalized and
localized to the cytosol
and the nucleus. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded (50 000) in 24-well
plates and grown until ∼70% confluent. The growth media was
replaced with the peptide-treated media (as indicated on the left
panel) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, before being gently
washed and imaged using a 20× objective lens (green indicates
the presence of the FITC-labeled peptide). The white arrow indicates
punctate structures corresponding to the FITC-labeled peptide. The
Hoechst dye (blue channel) was incorporated to allow the detection
of the nucleus.

Discussion
The
development of therapeutics for intracellular targets is greatly
hindered by the inability of the therapeutic molecule to pass through
the plasma membrane. The conjugation of CPPs, such as Penetratin,
to the bioactive molecule has dramatically improved the cellular uptake
of otherwise impermeable molecules, such as peptides, proteins, and
siRNA. When attached to Penetratin, the cyclic peptide, G7-18NATE,
is a successful inhibitor of Grb7, an established anticancer target.17 G7-18NATE has also previously been conjugated
to the shortened Penetratin sequence, RRMKWKKK, and appeared to co-localize
with Grb7 throughout the cytosol.28 Therefore,
to further investigate the potential of RRMKWKKK (P7) as a therapeutic
delivery vehicle, we have functionally characterized P7 and G7-18NATE-P7
compared with their full-length Penetratin counterparts (P16 and G7-18NATE-P16).

We identified that biotinylated versions of both P16 and P7 CPPs
were internalized to comparable levels into fixed HeLa cells. This
was consistent with an earlier report, in which the same method was
used to assess the uptake of a series of N- and C-terminal truncated
Penetratin peptides into HaCaT cells (a human fibroblast cell line)
and A549 cells (a human lung cancer cell line).15 In this study, P7 was found to be the minimal sequence
to efficiently cross membranes (∼60% compared to that of the
P16 sequence). This suggested that P7 should be an effective CPP for
delivering G7-18NATE. However, we observed that when P16 or P7 was
conjugated to G7-18NATE, only the G7-18NATE-P16 peptide was successful
at producing the biological response of migration inhibition in the
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A cells. This was surprising and suggested that
the G7-18NATE-P7 construct was either not able to bind to its Grb7
target or not reaching the cytosolic compartment, where Grb7 exists.
We showed, using a thermal shift assay, that G7-18NATE-P7 was still
able to bind to the Grb7-SH2 domain; therefore, we next compared the
abilities of P7 and P16 to not only enter cells but also reach the
cytosol. For this experiment, an NLS sequence was included so that
any observation of nuclear localization would indicate that the peptide
had reached the cytosol, where nuclear localization factors reside.
We demonstrated that FITC-P16-NLS was successful in reaching the cytosol
when visualized in live cells, whereas FITC-P7-NLS did not display
a uniform cytosolic distribution, with only faint punctate structures
visible in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Together, this shows that P7 is insufficient
for the delivery of the G7-18NATE peptide and suggests that this may
be due to its inability to fully penetrate the cellular membrane to
reach the cytosol.

The P7 peptide has been used in several studies
because of its
ability to traverse cell membranes.15 In
some cases, a successful delivery has been reported. A photoactivatable
form of the P7 peptide (through the attachment of photocleavable groups
on the lysines) showed uptake in various cancer cell lines when tested
using flow cytometry.29 Furthermore, in
a study by the Yang group, the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin attached
to the Penetratin-derived sequence, CKRRMKWKK, displayed improved
cellular uptake and antiproliferative effects compared to those of
the doxorubicin treatment alone.30

In contrast to these successful reports of internalization, the
Nielsen group reported a negligible uptake of the sequence FQNRRMKWKK
compared to that of the full-length Penetratin sequence.31 Likewise, for insulin absorption, it was demonstrated
that only the full-length Penetratin sequence, and not the shorter
NRRMKWKK, could facilitate the delivery of insulin through nasal mucosa.32 Brock and co-workers have reported that the
truncated peptide, NRRMKWKK, showed a poor translocation efficiency
when tested by fluorescence correlation microscopy on live cells.
However, when conjugated to the tyrosine kinase peptide inhibitor,
the truncated peptide showed a greatly enhanced cellular uptake.33 Whether or not this uptake is correlated to
bioactivity was not reported in this study.

The different conclusions
made for the P7 peptide may, in part,
result from the differences in the experimental methods used. A confounding
factor that has led to discrepancies between the observed cellular
uptake and the bioactivity of CPPs and CPP-cargo constructs is that,
once cells are fixed, there is no distinction between the peptides
that have reached the cytosol and the peptides that have entered the
cell via endocytosis but remained trapped in the endosomes. Lebleu
and co-workers identified that fixation techniques can lead to misleading
conclusions by redistributing the membrane-bound and vesicle-entrapped
peptide into the cytosol and the nucleus following permeabilization
of the membrane.34 Indeed, the initial
experiment that identified P7 as the minimal sequence required for
internalization was also conducted on fixed cells.15 This may also be the reason we observed the uptake of P7
into cells, yet with no bioactivity.28 As
our study using live cells showed, the FITC-P7 peptide only appeared
in punctate structures in the cell, consistent with the endosomal
entrapment.

The reason for the dramatic difference between the
abilities of
P16 and P7 to traverse cell membranes and deliver cargo likely relates
to their relative abilities to interact with and penetrate lipid bilayers.
In a recent study, conducted using dual-polarization interferometry
(DPI), we investigated the interactions of P16 and a truncated Penetratin
derivative (RRMKWKKK-Biotin) with model membranes.35 This revealed that P16 has a greater ability to interact
with fluid-phase POPC/POPG membranes than the truncated derivative.
Furthermore, kinetic modeling of the DPI data suggested that only
the full-length sequence was able to fully bind to the membrane and
disrupt the bilayer, whereas the truncated Penetratin made transient
interactions that had no effect on the bilayer structure. Thus, the
P7 peptide, despite its overall similar composition to the full-length
P16, may be unable to sufficiently interact with the lipid bilayer
to enable entry to the cytosol of the cell.

In conclusion, this
study has highlighted that the shortened Penetratin
delivery sequence is ineffective as a CPP. For efficient internalization
to the cytosol of live cells and for the delivery of bioactive molecules,
the full-length Penetratin sequence is required.

Methods
Cell Culture
All cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and passaged using standard
techniques. The HeLa cell line was maintained and tested in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS),
and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (ABAM) solution. The MDA-MB-231
cell line culture medium was Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)
Medium 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 9.5% FCS, 0.25 IU mL–1 human insulin (Actrapid Penfill), and 20 mM HEPES (Gibco). The MCF-10A
culture medium consisted of DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 5%
horse serum, human insulin (10 μg mL–1), hydrocortisone
(0.5 μg mL–1), EGF (20 ng mL–1), and cholera toxin (100 ng mL–1).

Peptide Synthesis
All peptides were prepared, either
commercially (Purar Chemicals, Australia) or in-house, by solid-phase
peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry and Rink amide resin (except
for FITC-labeled peptides, which utilized Fmoc-Val-Wang resin) and
cleavage from the resin using standard procedures. The solution concentration
of the peptides was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using
extinction coefficients determined from the amino acid content,36 except for FITC-labeled peptides that were quantitated
on the basis of the absorbance of fluorescein at 498 nm.37

Peptide Internalization
Assay
HeLa cells were seeded
in 96-well plates (30 000 cells per well) in a culture medium.
After 24 h, the media was replaced with a media containing the peptide
of interest (at 1 μM) and incubated for 15 min. The cells were
washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Tween20/PBS.
The endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity was neutralized by incubating
the plates at 65 °C for 60 min. The cells were blocked using
3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS and treated with streptavidin APase
(1 μg mL–1 in 0.1% BSA/PBS) for 30 min at
room temperature. Following three times washing with PBS, 50 μL
of 100 mg.mL–1 p-nitrophenol phosphate was introduced
and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The enzyme reaction
was quenched using 2 M NaOH. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm
using FLUOstar Omega. The samples were measured in triplicates, and
the background absorbance was determined using untreated cells and
subtracted from the test conditions. The statistical analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism6 (GraphPad Software, CA).

Wound-Closure
Migration Assay
The MDA-MB-231 or MCF-10A
cells were seeded until confluent in 24-well plates, wounded with
a sterile pipette tip to create a cell-free gap and cell debris cleared
away with fresh media. Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in sterile
MQ, diluted to the appropriate concentration in fresh media, and added
to the appropriate wells, with each treatment duplicated. The media
also contained 1 ng mL–1 EGF to stimulate migration.
The Leica AF6000 LX live-cell-imaging system was used to capture images
in real time (at 37 °C, 5% CO2), with images collected
every 30 min from a minimum of five positions per well. The remaining
gap area was measured using ImageJ (Fiji) at 0 and 12 h and averaged
from all measured positions across the duplicates. At least three
independent experiments were performed. To allow for a direct comparison,
the results are displayed as the relative percentage of gap closure
compared with the untreated control cells normalized to 100%.

Cellular
Uptake Assay
MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded
(50 000) in 24-well plates and grown until 60–70% confluent.
The media was replaced with the peptide-treated media (at 20 μM)
and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed gently
three times with the growth media and incubated with Hoechst-treated
media (1 μM) for 5 min at 37 °C before being transferred
to the Leica AF6000 LX live-cell-imaging system. Here, the cells were
maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and images were taken
within 15 min using a 20× objective lens.

Expression and Purification
of the Grb7-SH2 Domain
Grb7-SH2 (415–532 residues)
was incorporated into the pGex2T
plasmid and expressed and purified, as described previously.39

Thermal Shift Assays
The lyophilized
peptides of interest
were resuspended in 50 mM NaPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol,
and 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested at a final concentration
of 50 μM. Grb7-SH2, dialyzed in the same buffer (excluding DMSO),
was tested at 40 μM. Using Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Life Science),
the temperature was increased in 0.5 °C increments from 50 to
70 °C with a holding time of 60 s. The wavelength of excitation/emission
was measured at 530/555 nm. Each condition was measured in duplicate
or triplicate with values averaged. Peptide-only and buffer-only control
samples were measured and subtracted from the averaged test measurements.
At least three independent experiments were conducted. The statistical
analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism6 (GraphPad Software, CA).
