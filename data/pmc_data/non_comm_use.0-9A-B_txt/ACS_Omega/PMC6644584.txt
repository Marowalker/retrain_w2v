Aβ(1–40)
peptide is mutated to introduce cysteine
residue to allow formation of organized self-assembled monolayers
(SAMs) on Au electrodes. Three mutants of this peptide are produced,
which vary in the position of the inserted cysteine residue. Fourier
transform infrared data on these peptide SAMs show the presence of
both α helices and β sheet in these Aβ constructs.
These peptide constructs interact with cytochrome c (Cytc), allowing electron transfer between Cytc and the electrode via the Aβ peptides. Binding of
metals like Zn2+ or Cu2+ induces changes in
the morphologies of these assemblies, making them fold, which inhibits
their spontaneous interaction with Cytc.

1 Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is a common, progressive, fatal
neurodegenerative disorder with enigmatic cause and cure.1 The disease becomes severe with age, and in its
advanced stage, its pathological symptoms like confusion, memory loss,
mood swing, declined thinking ability, and physical independence become
prominent. Massive neuronal loss and disruption of synaptic function
throughout the brain are hallmark physical characteristics of AD.2 All of the risk factors in AD are associated
with abnormal production or clearance of amyloid β (Aβ)
peptide, which is the prime constituent of extraneuronal senile plaques
as well as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles.1,3 Aβ
is a small peptide accommodating 39–42 amino acids and is derived
from amyloidogenic proteolysis of the larger membrane-bound amyloid
precursor protein (APP) by the combined action of β-secretase
and γ-secretase.3−5 The most abundant fragments of this peptide are Aβ(1–40)
and Aβ(1–42). These peptides are bipolar with a hydrophilic
N-terminus part (first 16 residues) and a hydrophobic C-terminus part
(17–42 residues).6

Elevated
concentrations of transition-metal ions Cu, Zn, and Fe
in the neocortex of AD-affiliated brain advocate that metal dyshomeostasis
is a major culprit in the pathogenesis of AD along with protein aggregation.3,7−11 The hydrophilic region of Aβ contains all of the metal-binding
sites.12,13 A significant contribution of Zn2+ ions is found in the amyloidosis in transgenic mice, whereas the
role of Cu is still ambiguous.14−17 In vitro, under physiological pH, redox-active metals
like Cu and Fe and cofactors like heme-bound Aβ peptides can
catalyze the production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) like
O2–, O22–, and OH• through Fenton and Fenton-like chemistry.18−27 Overproduced27 amount of ROS initiates
lipid peroxidation and nucleic acid adduct formation rendering extensive
oxidative stress to the brain of AD patients.28−31

Abundance of high-molecular-weight
Aβ fibrils in amyloid
deposits initially implicated Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration
in AD pathology. However, later studies and evidences enunciate that
small soluble oligimeric form of Aβ is potentially more neurotoxic
than insoluble larger Aβ aggregates.32−37 The extracellular amyloid plaque is classically considered as the
histopathological marker of AD, but recent inspections have found
that Aβ even triggers plaque-independent synaptic toxicity.38 This finding points the existence of intracellular
pool of Aβ, which eventually elicits toxicity within the living
cell much earlier than the appearance of extracellular senile plaque.39 The accumulation of Aβ in the cytosolic
compartment is not surprising since its parental protein APP localizes
to trans-Golgi network, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomal, lysosomal,
and mitochondrial membranes along with plasma membrane.40 Being a potent cytotoxic agent, Aβ also
plays a dynamic role in apoptotic neuronal death although the obligate
mechanism involved is ill-defined.41,42 On Aβ
exposure, mitochondria loses its morphological integrity and functionality,
which highlights the localization of Aβ to the inner membrane
or membrane-associated compartment of mitochondria and its deliberate
interference with inner mitochondrial proteins.43−46 Several evidences suggest that
Aβ-mediated cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) inhibition
is an important contributor to the neurodegenerative cascade regarding
AD.33,47 Additionally, our group has previously demonstrated
the electron transfer between Cytc and heme–Aβ
complexes.48,49 These emerging facts incite investigations
into the possible interaction between Aβ and mitochondrial cytochrome c (Cytc).

Cytc is
a soluble hemoprotein found in the intermembrane
space of mitochondria being loosely attached to the surface of inner
mitochondrial membrane. It shuttles electrons from cytochrome bc1 (complex III) to CcO (complex IV) in the mitochondrial
respiratory chain and also participates in ATP production.50 Moreover, Cytc is a prime required
protein factor in programmed cell suicide and the load of translocated
Cytc in the cytosol is a potential signal for regulation
of cell apoptosis.51 Preponderance of structurally
conserved lysine residues creates a large contiguous domain of surface
positive charge around the heme crevice in the mitochondrial Cytc. This executive surface charge distribution provides the
site of interaction to the heme prosthetic group of Cytc with corresponding prosthetic groups of its physiological oxidoreductases
by complementary-charge reciprocation.52,53 Therefore,
negatively charged Aβ is a potential candidate to interact spontaneously
with Cytc, which shapes the basis of this current
investigation.

In the recent past, this group has established
that human Aβ(1–16)
forms self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on Au surfaces when appended
with a cysteine residue at its 17th position and these constructs
are demonstrated to survey the amount of ROS production by heme and
Cu-bound Aβ peptides.54 These customized
constructs have been also postulated to be an abiological platform
to test potential drugs that could interact with Cu/heme active sites.54 Later, the controlled formation of small and
large Aβ aggregates on Au surfaces has been reported resembling
the oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Aβ, respectively. On Cu/heme
binding, these morphologically different scaffolds appeared with discrete
relative ROS generation property and also render distinct response
to inhibitors like methylene blue and clioquinol analogue.55 The current report comprises the formation of
morphologically different constructs on Au surfaces employing three
customized mutants of Aβ(1–40) peptide, their structural
as well as behavioral change on Cu/Zn binding, and how these changes
affect the interaction of Aβ with Cytc.

2 Results and Discussion
Three Aβ(1–40)
peptide mutants, prepared by introducing
cysteine residue at different positions of the peptide chain by single-point
mutation, are abbreviated as Aβ(1–40)Y10C (viz. Y10C),
Aβ(1–40)L17C (viz. L17C), and Aβ(1–40)G38C
(viz. G38C). These mutant peptides are immobilized on Au surfaces
by means of SAM formation and found to exhibit different morphologies
on the surfaces. The heights of these assemblies on Au surfaces are
consistent with the number of amino acid residues present above the
surface considering 3.3 Å linear translation per peptide residue,
which is manifested in atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. In
G38C, the cysteine is present almost at the end of the Aβ peptide
chain. Thus, the observed height of 8–12 nm for this assembly
in AFM image is consistent with the fraction of a vertical assembly
on the surface (approximately 3.3 Å × 38, i.e., 12 nm).
Likewise, the height of the L17C assembly is almost half of the aforesaid
assembly, i.e., 6–7 nm according to AFM image, which is also
anticipated based on 3.3 Å linear translation per peptide residue.
Methodically, the position of cysteine residue in Y10C places the
height of this assembly (8–10 nm) in between that of G38C and
L17C. This interpretation is evident from the following schematic
representations of these mutants on Au surfaces (Figure 1) and the associated AFM images
with their topological height distribution profiles (Figure 2). According to AFM images,
these vertically upright Aβ assemblies on surfaces display smooth
homogeneous distribution even in the absence of coadsorbant thiols.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
experiments with these G38C, L17C, and
Y10C constructs in pH 7 phosphate-buffered solution show no redox
response. However, when the same experiment is performed in the presence
of 100 μM Bovine heart Cytc dissolved in pH
7 phosphate-buffered solution, a reversible process is found at 0.01
V vs Ag/AgCl and it is observed irrespective of the morphology of
these Aβ assemblies (Figure 3). This process characterizes the one-electron oxidation
reduction of Cytc in solution, which originates from
the heme prosthetic group of the protein representing the FeIII/II redox couple. We note that, in the presence of the same Cytc solution, bare Au electrode never shows any CV response
(Figure S1). Therefore, it evidently suggests
that electron transfer to heme of Cytc does not happen
from barely exposed Au electrode, whereas Aβ adlayers on Au
electrodes make this electron transfer possible. This phenomenon indicates
that an interaction between Aβ and the protein may exist. Previously,
our group has shown that reduced heme-Aβ transfers electron
to oxidized Cytc, where docking of positively charged
protein with the negatively charged Aβ was invoked to be responsible
for such occurrence.48 In this current
work, CV data suggests that Aβ adlayer plays an indispensable
role in electron transfer from electrode to Cytc,
which implies that an interaction between the protein and Aβ
can lead to such an event. Since Aβ carries an overall negative
charge of −3, it can approach the positive-charge domain of
Cytc surface around its heme crevice through complementary-charge
reciprocation and eventually the protein can dock with Aβ assemblies.
The importance of carboxylate groups of Aβ functioning in the
electron transfer between the electrode and Cytc has
been supported employing nonamyloid constructs with discrete terminal
groups. SAM of 1-octanethiol (C8SH SAM), which is devoid
of any carboxylate group, does not show any redox response in the
presence of Cytc, whereas such response appears when
Au electrode covered with the SAM of 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (i.e.,
carboxylate SAM), which exclusively carries terminal carboxylate groups,
was used (Figure S2). This divergence is
also represented in Scheme S1. We note
that the proclaimed interaction between Cytc and
Aβ is certainly electrostatic according to the previous report
of our group, where Cytc and heme-Aβ were found
to interact electrostatically.48 It is
relevant to other literature reports also, where the interactions
between Cytc and its other physiological oxidoreductases
in mitochondria are mentioned as electrostatic.53

Figure 3 Blue, violet, and dark green lines, respectively, in (a), (b),
and (c) designate the reversible FeIII/II process of Cytc on G38C-, L17C-, and Y10C-functionalized Au electrode,
respectively, in pH 7 at 20 mV/s using Ag/AgCl reference and Pt wire
counter electrodes.

Binding of redox-active
Cu2+ ion to Aβ constructs
is already documented in previous reports.54−58 Currently, CV experiments with Cu-bound G38C-, L17C-,
and Y10C-modified Au electrodes show quasi-reversible CuII/I process at 0.19, 0.17, and 0.08 V vs Ag/AgCl (Figure 4), respectively. We note that different E1/2 values for these Cu-bound assemblies indicate
that these immobilized mutants may offer different binding sites for
Cu or they may have different environments around the same Cu-binding
site. However, this is not the focus of the present report. From the
CV data, coverage values of Cu (i.e., number of Cu ions per unit area)
are calculated for all of these Cu-bound assemblies. The corresponding
values for Cu-G38C, Cu-L17C, and Cu-Y10C constructs are 7.657 ×
10–11, 2.756 × 10–11, and
1.672 × 10–11 mol/cm2.59−61 Since the average surface coverage of thiol SAM is of the order
of 1014 molecules/cm2, the Cu sites present
on these modified Au electrodes are thinly spread, which is also consistent
with previous reports on Cu-Aβcys17 SAM-covered Au
electrode.54,55

Figure 4 CV responses of Cu-G38C (orange)-, Cu-L17C
(green)-, and Cu-Y10C
(light blue)-modified Au electrodes in pH 7 at 20 mV/s using Ag/AgCl
reference and Pt wire counter electrodes.

Unlike the previous observations in CV experiment with metal-free
Aβ assemblies, these Cu-bound constructs do not exhibit the
characteristic FeIII/II redox couple of Cytc even in the presence of Cytc dissolved in pH 7
phosphate-buffered solution but display another quasi-reversible process
(Figure 5). Here, the
CV responses may represent CuII/I redox couple, which are
slightly altered compare to Figure 4 due to the presence of Cytc (Figure S3). This indicates the presence of an
interruption of electron transfer from the electrode to the protein
following binding of Cu to Aβ peptides.

Figure 5 Blue, violet, and dark
green lines in (a), (b), and (c) illustrate
the corresponding CV responses of Cytc employing
G38C-, L17C-, and Y10C-functionalized Au electrodes in pH 7 at 20
mV/s using Ag/AgCl reference and Pt wire counter electrodes. Further,
red, light green, and light blue lines in (a), (b), and (c) indicate
the corresponding CV responses of Cu-G38C, Cu- L17C, and Cu-Y10C constructs
in the presence of Cytc dissolved in pH 7 buffered
solution.

However, a possibility that the
CuII/I process overlaps
and envelopes the Cytc redox response prompted the
use of redox-inactive Zn metal as a surrogate of Cu to perform similar
experiments. Notably, Aβ assemblies upon binding Zn2+ ion do not show any CV response even in the presence of Cytc dissolved in pH 7 phosphate-buffered solution (Figure 6). It confirms that
the electron transfer from the electrode to heme of the protein is
no longer possible in the case of Zn-bound Aβ assemblies. This
inference makes the accumulation of Zn/Cu to Aβ adlayers responsible
for such an interruption of electron transfer and makes it only apparent
that any form of interaction between Cytc and Aβ
is jeopardized on Zn/Cu binding.

Figure 6 Blue, violet, and dark green lines, respectively,
in (a), (b),
and (c) illustrate CV responses of Cytc employing
G38C, L17C, and Y10C-modified Au electrodes in pH 7 at 20 mV/s using
Ag/AgCl reference and Pt wire counter electrodes. The corresponding
light green, light blue, and red lines in (a), (b), and (c) represent
CV responses of Zn-L17C, Zn-G38C, and Zn-Y10C constructs.

In the CV experiment with Zn-bound Aβ constructs,
the CV
of Cytc was not obtained when Aβ constructs
were kept incubated with a solution of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 90 min. It implies that the Aβ assemblies
may take around 90 min to completely accumulate Zn2+ ions
and thus the change in the CV response of Cytc during
this period is investigated. For this purpose, CV response of Cytc is monitored at several time intervals, while Aβ
constructs are persistently incubated with pH 7 phosphate-buffered
solution containing both Cytc and Zn2+ salt. Here, the CV current regarding FeIII/II redox couple
of Cytc is found to decline gradually with time,
and after a period, it completely disappears (Figure 7). We note that the electrode here is not
resistant to multiple scans (Figure S4).
This observation indicates that metal binding blocks the transfer
of electron from the electrode to the protein through the Aβ
adlayer, which is possible only if Aβ loses its contact to the
protein. It likely indicates that the residues responsible for the
negative charge over Aβ peptide (i.e., the carboxylates of six
amino acid residues in peptide chain) are no longer accessible to
the positive-charge domain of Cytc after binding
metal ions. Inhibition of electron transfer caused by participation
of carboxylate groups has been established in Figure S5 using carboxylate SAM-covered Au electrode.

and dark green indicators in (a), (b), and (c) represent the corresponding Ipc values, whereas the light green, light blue,
and red indicators in (a), (b), and (c) represent the corresponding Iac values.

To investigate the fate of Aβ assemblies upon metal
binding,
vibrational frequencies of these constructs are characterized by universal
attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared (UATR-FTIR)
analysis before and after metal accumulation. We note that before
metal binding, each construct illustrates amide I and amide II bands
in the region of 1600–1700 and 1500–1600 cm–1, respectively. Amide I is known to be originated predominantly from
the skeletal amide −C=O stretching vibrations of the
peptide with minor contribution of C–N stretching, C–C–N
deformation, and N–H in-plane bending. And amide II is known
to carry signature of out-of-plane C–N stretching, N–H
out-of-plane bending, and COO– asymmetric stretching
vibrations. In this study, two broad spectra in these spectral regions
indicate the occurrence of α-helical conformations (transmittance
near 1650 cm–1) in these immobilized Aβ assemblies
along with native β-sheet content (transmittance near 1630 cm–1).62−65 Upon Cu binding, a concomitant perturbation arises in these spectral
regions (Figure S6). Involvement of the
amino acid residues which compose Cu coordinating domain in Aβ
is believed to be responsible for such perturbation. We note that
rationalization of frequency shifts upon metal binding is difficult
due to the accompanying changes in the extent and nature of hydrogen-bonding
network of the peptide.66 However, a substantial
drop in transmittance intensity is observed for each assembly upon
Cu binding near 1265 cm–1, which classically represents
the C–O stretch of C–OH vibration of a carboxylic acid
group (Figure 8). It
indicates that some of the side-chain carboxylates (these groups may
remain H-bonded through salt-bridge interaction in peptide) in Aβ
show bona fide participation in Cu coordination. This is consistent
with the apical coordination of side-chain carboxylate to Cu as proposed
in the literature.67−77 Similar observations were also found for Zn-bound peptide assemblies
that reinforce the involvement of side-chain carboxylates toward metal
binding validating the newly mentioned assignment in the present work.78

Figure 8 The particular peak near 1265 cm–1 in
FTIR data
represents −C–O single-bond vibration of −C–OH
group for (a) G38C (blue), (b) L17C (violet), and (c) Y10C (dark green)
assembly. The corresponding perturbation in transmittance of this
particular peak is clearly visible for (a) Cu-G38C (red), (b) Cu-L17C
(light green), and (c) Cu-Y10C (light blue) constructs.

We note that HQ (8-hydroxyquinoline) being a clioquinol
analogue
is reported in the literature to sequestrate Cu from Cu-Aβ complexes
in solution3,18,79 as well as from Cu-bound Aβ assemblies immobilized on Au surfaces.18,54,79 In this current work, HQ has
been successfully used to sequestrate Cu from the Cu-Aβ constructs
and it has been confirmed in CV experiment (Figure 9A). Following the protocol reported54,55 previously, Cu-L17C construct is immersed into 15 nM HQ solution
and the corresponding UATR-FTIR data are collected. Here, transmittance
intensity of the particular peak near 1265 cm–1,
which is attributed to the C–O stretch of C–OH vibration,
is found to be restored (Figure 9B). This suggests that the side-chain carboxylate involved
in Cu binding returns to its previous form due to sequestration of
Cu from Aβ assemblies. This phenomenon further validates the
assignment of this observed vibrational band and the involvement of
carboxylate in Cu coordination.

Figure 9 (a) The blue line illustrates CV response
of Cu-L17C construct
in pH 7 buffered solution at 20 mV/s using Ag/AgCl reference and Pt
wire counter electrodes. The red line illustrates the same when the
construct was incubated with HQ solution for 60 min. (b) The particular
peak near 1265 cm–1 in FTIR data representing −C–O
single bond vibration of −C–OH group is shown in violet
for L17C. The corresponding perturbation in transmittance of this
particular peak for Cu-L17C construct and its restoration upon HQ
exposure are clearly visible in light green and light blue.

Observations from CV and FTIR
experiments prompt that metal binding
may impose an alteration to Aβ adlayer. According to AFM images
and the corresponding height distribution profiles, all Cu- and Zn-bound
Aβ assemblies appear shorter compared to their metal-free analogues.
The heights of Aβ constructs before metal binding and the corresponding
changes upon Cu and Zn binding are summarized in Table 1. Figure 10 (right panel) and S7 in the SI represent, respectively, the AFM images of Cu- and Zn-bound
Aβ assemblies with their topological height distribution profiles.
A comparison of metal-free Aβ constructs and their corresponding
Cu-bound analogues is also given in Figure 10. The observed morphological changes of
Aβ assemblies upon metal accumulation proposes that binding
of metal to Aβ induces folding of the peptides, which results
in shrinkage in the heights of the constructs.

Figure 10 Comparison of heights
of Aβ constructs before metal binding
and corresponding changes after binding of Cu to those assemblies
observed in AFM images. (A), (B), and (C) represent, respectively,
G38C-, L17C-, and Y10C-modified Au surfaces with their respective
topographic height distribution profiles (a), (b), and (c). Similarly,
(E), (F), and (G) represent, respectively, Cu-G38C-, Cu-L17C-, and
Cu-Y10C-modified Au surfaces with their respective topographic height
distribution profiles (e), (f), and (g).

Zn to Those Assemblies

metal-free assemblies	8–12	6–7	8–10	
Cu-bound assemblies	5–6	4–5	4–5	
Zn-bound assemblies	4–6	5–6	5–6	
Moreover, growth in the CV current
of CuII/I redox response
is monitored at several intervals employing L17C construct incubated
persistently with CuSO4 solution. From the corresponding
coverage values of Cu at different intervals of incubation, the rate
of Cu uptake by this construct is found to be 0.13 min–1. Meanwhile, decrease in the height of L17C assembly upon Cu binding
is probed by AFM analysis at several intervals incubating this construct
persistently with CuSO4 solution. The topological height
distribution diagrams at different intervals of incubation postulates
that the height of this assembly shrinks gradually over a period with
simultaneous Cu uptake. The span of time this assembly takes to be
shrunk in height is parallel to the rate of Cu uptake by this assembly
(Figure 11). This
observation suggests that Cu binding promotes concomitant folding
of Aβ peptides immobilized on Au surfaces.

3 Conclusions
In summary, three mutants of
Aβ(1–40) peptides are
immobilized on Au electrodes in this current work using previously
reported SAM formation technique. Different positions of introduced
cysteine residues at these peptide chains lead to discrete morphologies
on the surface. Unlike bare Au electrode, here the electrodes covered
with these Aβ assemblies successfully transfer electron to heme
of the Bovine heart Cytc, which declares prominent
participation of Aβ adlayer in this process. There are several
reports on Aβ-induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization,
which leads to efflux of Cytc, but no direct interaction
between Cytc and Aβ is evidenced to date.80−82 This current report refer that Cytc having positive-charge
domain around its heme crevice can dock with negatively charged Aβ
through electrostatic interaction. However, accumulation of metals
like Cu/Zn to these Aβ assemblies mediates folding of Aβ
peptides, which arrests all of the negatively charged residues (side-chain
carboxylates of peptide) into the fold. It impairs the aforesaid electron
transfer by blocking the proclaimed interaction between Aβ and
the protein. Here, folding of Aβ is concurrent with its metal
accumulation. Therefore, this present study employing an abiological
platform reports an immediate interaction of Aβ with the electron-transfer
protein Cytc and also suggests that Cu/Zn binding
to Aβ inhibits that interaction, eventually leaving a scope
to attenuate any possible Aβ-mediated toxicity to mitochondrial
Cytc.

Cytochrome c, from Bovine heart, BioChemika (≥95%
(GE)); potassium hexaflurophosphate (KPF6) (≥99%);
zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) (99.999% trace metal basis); 8-hyroxyquinoline (HQ) (99%),
and 1-octanethiol, 6-mercaptohexanoic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4·2H2O), copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chloroform, and
absolute ethanol were purchased from Merck. Au wafers were purchased
from Platypus Technologies. These wafers were made of 1000 Å
of Au on 50 Å of Ti adhesion layer sited on the top of a Si (111)
surface.

4.2 Instrumentation
All electrochemical
experiments were performed using a CH Instruments (model CHI710D Electrochemical
Analyzer). Counter electrodes, reference electrodes, and Teflon plate
material were purchased from CH Instruments. The AFM data were obtained
at room temperature in a Veeco dicp II (model no: AP-0100) instrument
bearing a phosphate-doped Si cantilever (1–10 Ω cm; thickness,
3.5–4.5 μm; length, 115–135 μm; width, 30–40
μm; resonance frequency, 245–287 kHz; elasticity, 20–80
N/m). FTIR data were obtained at room temperature in universal attenuated
total reflection (UATR) setup of PerkinElmer using a mercury cadmium
telluride (MCT) detector.

4.3 Construction of the Modified
Electrodes
4.3.1 Formation of Self-Assembled Monolayer (SAM)
Gold wafers were cleaned electrochemically, first by electrolysis,
where it was held at a high positive potential (2.1 V) for few seconds
and then by sweeping several times between 1.8 and −0.3 V in
0.5 M H2SO4. Each mutant (G38C, L17C, Y10C)
was weighed and taken individually in triple-distilled water to make
0.1 mM SAM solutions. Freshly cleaned Au wafers were thoroughly rinsed
with triple-distilled water, purged with N2 gas, and then
immersed in the SAM solutions for 2 days. To study aggregation properties
by AFM and FTIR experiments, the surfaces were prepared similarly.
Nonamyloid SAM solutions were prepared using 1 mM 1-octanethiol and
1 mM 6-mercaptohexanoic acid in absolute ethanol.

4.3.2 Attachment of Cu and Zn onto SAM
Gold wafers immersed
in the SAM solutions were taken out and rinsed
with triple-distilled water to remove excess adsorbate and dried with
N2 gas to remove the residual solvent. The wafers were
then inserted into plate material evaluating cell (ALS Japan). CuSO4·5H2O solution (10 mM) in DMSO and 10 mM Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O solution in DMSO were
used as the incubating solutions of Cu and Zn, respectively. Cu-Aβ
and Zn-Aβ surfaces were prepared by incubation with the respective
solutions over 90 min. After that period, the surfaces were rinsed
with DMSO for 2 s to remove excess physiadsorbed Cu or Zn (if any)
and dried by purging N2 gas.

4.4 Preparation
of Cytc Solution
Cytc solution
of 2–3 mM concentration was
prepared by dissolving Bovin heart Cytc in pH 7 phosphate
buffer. Then, the stock solution was diluted to 100 μM with
pH 7 phosphate buffer and its exact concentration was determined from
its absorbance at 550 nm for the completely reduced species.

4.5 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) Experiments
CV data were collected
in pH 7 phosphate buffer to obtain the redox
potentials using modified electrodes. Bovine heart Cytc was dissolved in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution for all of the electrochemical
experiments. For the time-dependent assay, a mixture of Cytc and Zn(OAc)2 was dissolved in phosphate-buffered
solution and the final pH was maintained at 7.

4.6 Coverage
Calculation
The coverage
for a particular species is estimated by integrating the oxidation
and reduction currents of the respective species. During this calculation,
background currents of the constructs have been taken care of.

4.7 UATR-FTIR Experiments
Aβ as
well as metal-bound Aβ-modified Au wafers were prepared as described
in the previous sections. The surfaces were thoroughly rinsed with
triple-distilled water and dried by purging N2 before analysis.
Cu-bound Aβ-modified surfaces were immersed into 15 nM HQ solution
in H2O for 1 h and then the surfaces were thoroughly rinsed
with triple-distilled water followed by N2 purging. During
the experiment, the MCT detector was maintained at a temperature of
around 77 K.
