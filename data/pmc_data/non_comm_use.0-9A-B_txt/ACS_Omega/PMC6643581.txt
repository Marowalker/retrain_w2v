A dismantlable
adhesion system satisfies both a strong bonding
strength during use and a quick debonding process on demand in response
to an external stimulus as a trigger for dismantling. In this study,
we synthesized acrylate copolymers consisting of 2-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl acrylate (BHEA), 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2EHA),
and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) as the repeating units and evaluated
the properties as dismantlable adhesives. First, the thermal degradation
behavior of the obtained polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric
analysis and IR spectroscopy. The BHEA-containing polymers were thermally
stable during heating at a temperature below 150 °C, but they
rapidly degraded, i.e., the deprotection of the tert-butoxycarbonyl groups occurred during heating at 200 °C. The
onset temperatures for the deprotection depended on the BHEA and HEA
contents and their sequence structures because the hydroxy group in
the side chain accelerated the deprotection via an autocatalytic reaction
mechanism. Shear holding power and 180° peel tests were carried
out with the pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes using the BHEA-containing
copolymers as the adhesive materials. The copolymers consisting of
the BHEA, 2EHA, and HEA units with 25.7, 35.0, and 39.3 mol %, respectively,
exhibited the highest adhesion strength and the subsequent quick reduction
of the adhesion strength by heating during the dismantling process.
The addition of hexamethylene diisocyanate as the cross-linker and
Zn(acac)2 as the Lewis acid to the adhesive polymers was
demonstrated to be valid for the design of high-performance dismantlable
adhesion systems. A change in the rheological properties during the
dismantling process was important for a quick response and selective
interfacial failure between the substrate and the adhesive.

Introduction
Recently, adhesion
science and technology have become more important
in interdisciplinary fields.1 In fact,
adhesion bonding is indispensable for the construction of new multimaterial
systems consisting of metals, ceramics, thermoplastic polymers, thermosetting
resins, fiber-reinforced plastics, and bio-related materials as the
composites.2−7 A dismantlable (i.e., on-demand debonding) adhesion system, which
implies both a strong bonding strength without deterioration during
use and a quick reduction in the bonding strength on demand, is smart
technology for the fields of material recycling and temporary bonding.8 For the design of dismantlable adhesive materials,
their adhesive properties are required to instantaneously change in
response to any external stimulus as a trigger for dismantling. In
recent decades, various adhesive materials and their dismantling systems
have been reported, i.e., photoswitchable polymers,9−13 chemically and photodegradable polymers,14−21 thermally expansive microcapsules,22,23 electrochemically
reactive systems,24,25 polyelectrolyte brushes,26 reversible cross-linking,27−30 supramolecular polymers,31,32 bioinspired systems,33−36 etc.

We previously reported dismantlable adhesion systems
using reactive
acrylic copolymers consisting of tert-butyl acrylate
(tBA), 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2EHA), and 2-hydroxyethyl
acrylate (HEA) units as the pressure-sensitive adhesive polymers.37−39 A photoacid generator was used to simultaneously obtain thermal
stability during use and high reactivity for the debonding after acid
generation by photoirradiation.37 In this
system, the significant reduction of the peel strength was achieved
by the acid-catalyzed deprotection of the tBA units
in the copolymers after applying dual stimuli, i.e., photoirradiation
with subsequent heating. To design adhesives more sensitive to external
stimuli, we developed acrylic copolymers containing the 1-isobutoxyethyl
acrylate unit, which were readily deprotected under single-stimulus
conditions, such as hydrolysis and acidolysis at room temperature
under photoirradiation.40 These adhesion
systems were highly sensitive to an acid catalyst. Therefore, a lack
of stability during storage for a long time or against an unexpected
heating in the presence of any acidic compound was disadvantageous
for application uses in various fields.

As one of the other
protecting groups, the tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC)41−43 group has been used for chemically amplified photoresists44−47 and programmed degradation of polymeric materials48−51 because tert-butoxycarbonyloxybenzenes are quantitatively transformed into the
corresponding phenols accompanying the evolution of carbon dioxide
and isobutene gases. The thermally induced and acid-catalyzed deprotection
of poly(4-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxy)styrene) (PBSt)
has been intensively investigated.44−48 We also reported the thermal degradation and gas
bubbles formation of the polymers including a BOC group in the side
chain.52 The deprotection of the BOC groups
was expected to be applied to the design of pressure-sensitive adhesive
polymers, but no report about the synthesis and application of polyacrylates
including BOC groups was found in the literature, except the thermal
degradation of poly((4-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxy)phenyl)methyl
acrylate).53 This acrylate polymer including
the BOC-protected phenol moiety exhibited a thermal degradation behavior
similar to that of PBSt. The polymers containing the BOC-protected
phenyl moiety are sensitive to thermal and acidic stimuli and useful
as reactive polymers, such as resist materials. On the other hand,
both the robustness during use and the quick response for dismantling
are needed for the practical use of dismantlable adhesives. In addition,
selective interface failure without any pollution of the substrates
by the adhesive transfer is also required by the control of the mechanical
property of the adhesive materials. Recently, we have confirmed that
2-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl acrylate (BHEA) was
readily obtained by the reaction of HEA with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate.41,42 In this study, therefore, we
designed acrylate copolymer sequences consisting of BHEA, 2EHA, and
HEA as the new dismantlable adhesion polymer materials. The BHEA unit
was used as the repeating unit including the reactive side group,
and the 2EHA and HEA units were the most typical repeating units as
the pressure-sensitive adhesive materials. We evaluated their thermal
and adhesive properties of the copolymers as the dismantlable adhesive
materials. The addition effects of the diisocyanate and acidic compounds
for acceleration of the cross-linking reactions were also investigated.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of BHEA-Containing Polymers
BHEA was prepared
by the reaction of HEA with tert-butyl dicarbonate
by stirring in toluene at room temperature for 24 h in the presence
of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), as shown in Scheme 1. BHEA was isolated as a colorless liquid
in 87% yield. The radical polymerization of BHEA in the absence and
presence of 2EHA and HEA was carried out in anisole at 60 °C
with 2,2′-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) to synthesize the
homopolymer of BHEA (P1), the copolymers of BHEA with
2EHA (P2s), and the copolymers of BHEA with 2EHA and
HEA (P3s), as shown in Scheme 2. The results for the synthesis of the polymers
are summarized in Table 1.

After 3 h polymerization, the polymers were isolated in 41–90%
yields by precipitation in a large amount of a methanol/water mixture
in 9/1 volume ratio. The obtained polymers were soluble in chloroform
and tetrahydrofuran (THF), and they were used for NMR and size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) measurements. P3c containing the
highest amount of HEA (54.6 mol %) was exceptionally insoluble in
THF. The Mw values were as high as 1.5–6.3
× 105, being sufficient to function as adhesive polymers.
The 1H NMR spectra of the obtained polymers are shown in Figure S1. The copolymer compositions were determined
based on the intensity ratio of the characteristic methylene peaks,
i.e., −OCH2CH2O– for the BHEA
unit observed at 4.2 ppm, −OCH2– for the
2EHA unit at 3.9 ppm, and −CH2OH for the HEA unit
at 3.8 ppm. During the copolymerization of BHEA and 2EHA, the copolymer
compositions were almost the same as the composition in the feed,
due to the similar copolymerization reactivities of BHEA and 2EHA.
For the three-component copolymerization, including BHEA, 2EHA, and
HEA, a larger amount of HEA and a smaller amount of BHEA were incorporated
into the copolymers, due to the high reactivity of HEA. It was reported
that HEA showed a reactivity higher than 2EHA during radical copolymerizations,
i.e., r1 = 0.88 and r2 = 0.5 for the copolymerization of HEA (M1) and ethyl acrylate (M2),54 and r1 = 0.43 and r2 = 0.28 for the copolymerization of HEA (M1) and styrene (M2),55 and r1 = 0.23 and r2 = 1.17 for the copolymerization
of ethyl acrylate (M1) and styrene (M2)55 in the literature. Recently,
the enhanced reactivity of the vinyl monomers by the interaction with
hydroxy groups during the radical polymerization has been revealed
by various approaches, such as kinetic analysis,56 solvent effect,57 density functional
theory calculations,58,59 radical polymerization of vinyl
ethers,60 etc.

The glass-transition
temperature (Tg) of P1 was
determined to be 20.0 °C by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement. For the copolymers with 2EHA,
P2s, the Tg value decreased
along with an increase in the 2EHA content to −64.1 °C.
The three-component copolymers, P3s, had Tg values in the range of −18.0 to −26.6
°C, corresponding to the content of 2EHA (28.4–48.2 mol
%). These Tg values suggest the availability
of these copolymers as pressure-sensitive adhesive materials.

Thermogravimetric
(TG) Analysis
The thermal stability
of the BHEA-containing polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric
(TG) analysis at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in nitrogen stream.
The thermograms for P1, P2c, and P3b are shown in Figure 1. The BOC group released carbon dioxide and isobutene as gaseous
products upon heating around 200 °C, as shown in Scheme 3. The Td5 and Tmax values for the first-step
reaction as the deprotection of a BOC group and those for the second-step
degradation of the deprotected polymers are summarized in Table 2. The observed and
theoretical residual weights are also shown in Table 2.

The Td5 and Tmax values
for the deprotection of P1 were 199
and 215 °C, respectively. The residual weight after the first-step
deprotection was 53.3%, which well agreed with the calculated value
(53.7%). For the copolymers of BHEA with 2EHA (P2a–e), the Td5 and Tmax values increased with an increase in the 2EHA content.
The degradation temperatures were 239 and 243 °C for the BOC
groups included in P2e, of which the 2EHA content was
89.4 mol %. For the copolymers of BHEA with 2EHA and HEA (P3a–c), the Td5 values
were in the range of 170–194 °C and the Tmax values were in the range of 208–226 °C.
For the copolymer preparation in this study, we fixed the BHEA and
2EHA contents at a 1/1 molar ratio in the feed to keep the appropriate Tg value for the pressure-sensitive adhesive
materials. As a result, each content in the copolymers varied according
to their copolymerization reactivity (see Table 1). The degradation temperatures decreased
along with an increase in the HEA content. This was due to the autocatalytic
effect, as discussed in the next section. The residual weights of
the copolymers after the deprotection were slightly lower than the
calculated one. The BHEA-containing polymers synthesized in this study
were stable at room temperature, and no change was observed after
they were stored for several months. The Tg value of P1 was 20.0 °C, which increased to 35.5
°C by the deprotection of the BOC group during heating at 200
°C for 30 min. The homopolymer of HEA was expected to be produced
after the quantitative deprotection of the BOC group of PBHEA. The
second-step degradation of the resulting polymers after the deprotection
of the BOC group occurred and accompanied by a moderate weight loss
in the wide temperature range of 250–450 °C, being different
from the rapid weight loss for the first-step BOC deprotection. The
second-step degradation included various kinds of reactions, such
as ester decomposition, transesterification, ether formation, main
chain scission, etc.

Degradation Mechanism of BOC Groups
The process of
the transformation of the BOC group was investigated by IR spectroscopy.
A change in the IR spectrum was monitored during heating at 200 °C
using the polymer films cast on a silicon plate. A change in the IR
spectrum of P1 is shown in Figure 2. After heating, the polymers became insoluble
in organic solvents. The intensities of a peak due to the C=O
stretching vibration of the carbonate group at 1738 cm–1, four peaks due to the C–H stretching vibrations of the methyl
and methylene groups at 2860–2959 cm–1, and
a peak due to the O–C–C out-of-plane deformation vibration
of the tert-butoxy group at 1165 cm–1 rapidly decreased according to the heating time within the initial
several minutes. A broad absorption due to the O–H stretching
vibration simultaneously appeared around 3400 cm–1, and its intensity increased. No change was observed after further
heating. This supported the formation of the polymer of HEA by the
rapid and quantitative deprotection of the BOC group in the side chain
of P1. Similar changes were observed for the copolymers,
as shown in Figure S5. On the basis of
the analysis of the peak intensity changes, we determined the conversion
of the BOC group to the hydroxy group. The time–conversion
curves for P1 and the P2s are shown in Figure 2b. This plot indicated
that the deprotection of P1 occurred very fast and the
transformation completely finished within 10 min. In contrast, the
reaction slowly proceeded for the P2s. The complete deprotection
was achieved by a longer heating. The deprotection rate depended on
the BHEA content in the copolymer.

curves for deprotection of BOC groups for P1 (black), P2a (red), P2b (blue), and P2d (green).
Heated at 200 °C on a silicon plate. The films were prepared
by casting of the toluene solution (10 wt %) of each polymer and drying.

It was previously reported that
an autocatalytic deprotection process
was observed for the BOC-containing polymers based on the analysis
of the weight-loss curves of TG under the isothermal deprotection
conditions at different temperatures.49 We also checked the reaction mechanism for the deprotection of the
BOC-containing acrylate polymers. The weight loss curves at a constant
temperature (200 °C) for P1 and the P2s are shown in Figure 3a. These TG curves were converted to the time–conversion curves
as shown in Figure 3b. The results obtained from the IR and TG analyses in the present
study were consistent with each other. The S-shape time–conversion
curves suggested the contribution of an autocatalytic reaction mechanism61 for the deprotection of the BOC group (see also Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). It
was noted that the order of the Td5 values
was P2b (195 °C) > P3a (194 °C)
> P3b (177 °C) > P3c (170 °C),
which well agreed with the content of the HEA repeating units in the
copolymer, as shown in Table 2. An increase in the Td5 values
for the P2s with a decrease in the BHEA content in the
copolymers, i.e., P2a (191 °C) < P2b (195 °C) < P2c (225 °C) < P2d (233 °C) < P2e (239 °C), can be accounted
for by the probability of the consecutive sequence of the BHEA units.
It was speculated that an autocatalytic reaction was promoted by the
interaction of an aliphatic hydroxy group produced by the deprotection,
as shown in Scheme 4. The magnitude of the autocatalytic reaction of the present system
was lower than that for the BOC-protected phenols, due to a high pKa value for alcohols.

Shear Holding Power and
180° Peel Tests
Figure 4 and Table 3 summarize the results of a
shear holding power test using P2s and P3b as the adhesive polymers to determine a time to failure (Tf) and a creep distance after 60 min (L60). The Tf and L60 values were determined using various weights
in a range of 5–100 g for the 10 mm × 10 mm overlap joints
at room temperature. As a result, the Tf values for each adhesive were in the order of P3b ≫ P2a > P2b > P2c > P2e, as shown in Figure 4. It was confirmed that the holding time increased
with an increase
in the BHEA content, i.e., an increase in the Tg value, based on the results for the P2s. In
addition, the largest Tf value for P3b indicated that the introduction of the HEA units effectively
enhanced the holding power of the adhesive polymer without a change
in the Tg value, due to the intermolecular
hydrogen bonding. Simultaneously, the L60 values decreased by the increasing Tg and the introduction of HEA units (Table 3).

a Determined using 10 mm × 10
mm overlap joints at room temperature.

When P2s and P3b were heated
at 200 °C
for 40 min, no failure of the joints occurred. The L60 value was equal to zero, i.e., no creep was observed
after heating. These results suggested that the holding power of the
adhesive polymers increased by the enhancements of wettability and
interactions at an interface between the stainless steel substrate
and the adhesive polymer containing polar hydroxy groups. Previously,
Sato et al. reported a decrease in the shear holding power of a dismantlable
adhesion system using polyperoxides as the thermally degradable polymers,17 being different from the results observed in
the present study using the BOC-protected acrylate copolymers. Although
the polyperoxides were plasticized by the low-molecular-weight products
formed during thermal treatment in the dismantling process, the BOC-containing
acrylate copolymers were hardened and their Tg values increased after the deprotection. The evolved gaseous
products diffused out of the adhesives, and the remaining polar hydroxy
groups showed no plasticizing effect.

On the basis of the shear
holding power tests, it was revealed
that the HEA-containing P3b exhibited the high holding
power enough to be used as the pressure-sensitive adhesive material.
The superiority of the copolymers containing a considerable amount
of unprotected or BOC-protected hydroxy groups with an appropriate Tg value as the dismantlable adhesive materials
was verified.

The results for the peel strengths before and
after heating are
summarized in Table 4 and Figure 5. When
the specimens for the 180° peel test were heated at 200 °C
for 40 min, the formation of gas bubbles in the adhesive layer by
the deprotection of BOC groups was observed for all of the samples
containing the BOC groups in the side chain (Figure S6). Peel strength values before and after heating depended
on the adhesive polymer structures. The peel strength of P2a before heating was 0.17 ± 0.14 N/25 mm, which was much lower
than the peel strength for the commercial pressure-sensitive adhesive
tapes (typically 1–30 N/25 mm).62 A stick–slip phenomenon was observed during the peeling processes.
This was due to the relatively high Tg (−12.5 °C) of the adhesive. The peel strength increased
to 0.93 ± 0.32 N/25 mm after heating. It was already described
that the formation of hydroxy groups by deprotection increased the Tg value. The formation of network structures
of the adhesive polymer also increased the adhesion strength. P2d also showed a low peel strength (0.43 ± 0.02 N/25
mm) before heating and no change after heating because of a small
content of BHEA units (19.2 mol %). Among the P2s, P2b with the appropriate Tg value
of −29.4 °C exhibited the most suitable properties of
the dismantlable adhesion materials, i.e., high adhesion strength
(7.91 ± 0.25 N/25 mm) before heating and the significant reduction
of the strength (0.67 ± 0.13 N/25 mm) after heating. The relative
adhesion strength after heating was less than 10% of the original
strength. The change in the adhesion property was sufficient to be
used as dismantlable adhesives.38,39 However, the failure
mode was cohesive failure after heating (Table 4). For a dismantlable adhesion system, the
interface failure occurring between a substrate and an adhesive layer
is required. In the case of P2b, the adhesion property
was reduced by the void formation due to the carbon dioxide and isobutene
gases that evolved in the adhesive layer. To realize the selective
interfacial failure, the cohesive force of the adhesive polymers should
be higher and the void formation in the adhesive layer should be suppressed.
It was previously pointed out that the bubble formation in the adhesive
layer tended to induce cohesive failure rather than interfacial failure
during the dismantling process of the other pressure-sensitive adhesive
system.63

to cohesive

The presence of
the HEA repeating unit in the copolymers was expected
to increase the cohesive force of the adhesive polymers. We designed
the copolymer compositions for the three-component adhesives on the
basis of the composition and the adhesion properties of P2b. In this study, we prepared three kinds of HEA-containing copolymers, P3a–c. Because the Tg value of the homopolymer of HEA was −15 °C, we
could change the composition without an unexpected change in the Tg value by the addition of HEA units into the
copolymers. P3a had a Tg of
−26.6 °C and exhibited a high strength value before heating
(12.5 ± 0.80 N/25 mm). Similarly, P3b with a Tg of −21.7 °C showed the highest
value (15.3 ± 0.66 N/25 mm) as the initial adhesion property.
A further increase in the HEA content increased the Tg value, leading to a decrease in the adhesion strength,
as seen in the results for the peel strength of P3c in Figure 5. The adhesive strength
of the P3s decreased with an increase in the heating
time, being different form the results of the shear holding tests.
The greatest difference in the adhesion strength before and after
heating was observed for P3a. The relative adhesion strength
after heating at 200 °C for 40 min increased in the order of P3a (0.07) < P3b (0.20) < P3c (0.64). The absolute strength values after heating for P3b and P3c (3.11–3.12 N/25 mm) were higher than
the corresponding value for P3a (0.90 ± 0.21 N/25
mm). The lower BHEA content and too high HEA content were disadvantageous
for effective dismantling.

Rheological Property
We carried
out dynamic viscoelasticity
measurements of the adhesive polymers to discuss the effect of the
elasticity of the adhesives on the adhesion strength and the dismantling
performance. The storage modulus (G′) and
loss modulus (G″) were determined at the angular
frequencies (ω = 2πf) of 0.06–200
rad/s at room temperature. Figure 6a–d shows the plots of G′, G″, and tan δ (= G″/G′) values as a function of the ω value for P2s and P3a before heating. As usual, a shear
holding power is closely related to the viscoelastic property evaluated
at a low frequency. On the other hand, the peel behavior of pressure-sensitive
adhesive tapes is often discussed based on the dynamic mechanical
parameters observed at an angular frequency more than 102 rad/s.

Figure 6 Plots of G′, G″,
and tan δ as a function of angular frequency for (a) P2a, (b) P2b, (c) P2d, and (d) P3a before heating and (e) P2b and (f) P3a after heating at 200 °C for 40 min.

In Table 5, the G′ and tan δ values
determined at 0.0628
and 112 rad/s are summarized. The G′ values
were 10.0, 1.39, and 0.108 at 0.0628 rad/s and 371, 96.3, and 51.2
kPa at 112 rad/s for P2a, P2b, and P2d, respectively. The order in these values was the same
as the orders in the Tg values and the
shear holding power. The G″ values were higher
than the corresponding G′ values, i.e., tan δ
was greater than unity over the whole frequency range for the P2s, as shown in Figure 6a–c. This indicated that the adhesive materials
used in this study were typical viscous fluids. P2d partially
exhibited an elastic property in the peel test (low peel strength
and stick–slip behavior). This was understood by the rheological
behavior of this adhesive shown in Figure 6c, in which the G′
and G″ curves integrate and tan δ
became almost unity at frequencies over 10 rad/s.

After heating
at 200 °C for 40 min for the dismantling process,
the G′ values increased and the tan δ
values became less than unity (Figure 6e) because the adhesive polymers changed from a fluid
to elastic one. It was revealed that intermolecular hydrogen bonding
between the HEA units produced by the thermal deprotection of the
BOC groups significantly contributed to an increase in the G′ value at a low angular frequency (i.e., a change
in the value from 1.39 to 13.0 kPa for P2b, as shown
in Table 5). The HEA-containing P3a exhibited higher G′ and lower
tan δ values compared to P2b without HEA
units before heating. The changes observed in the G′ and tan δ values after heating for P3a were also noteworthy, being similar to the results for P2b. Thus, viscoelastic data supported the efficient network formation
by cross-linking due to the presence of the HEA repeating units in
the copolymer. The cross-linking structure was confirmed by the determination
of the insoluble fractions. The insoluble fraction reached 59% after
heating at 200 °C for 40 min, as shown in Table 6.

Addition Effects of Cross-Linker and Lewis Acid
The
effects of some additives on the adhesion behavior were investigated
using P3a as the adhesive polymer for the dismantlable
adhesion system. First, we checked the thermal degradation temperatures
of P3a in the presence of hexamethylene diisocyanate
(HDI) as the cross-linker by TG analysis at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
As shown in Table 2, no change was observed in the Td5 and Tmax values for the deprotection of the BOC group
at the first-step decomposition, whereas the decomposition temperatures
for the second step increased. This was due to the formation of the
cross-linking points between the hydroxy units produced by the deprotection
of the BOC group. Next, we examined the addition effect of the Lewis
acid. The addition of Zn(acac)2 decreased the Td5 value by approximately 40 °C. Similar decreases
in the Td5 values by the acid-catalyzed
deprotection were observed for the other dismantlable adhesive polymers
obtained from 4-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxy)styrene and tBA. In fact, the Td5 value
of poly(tert-butyl acrylate) decreased from 233 to
82 °C by the addition of an acid.37 The addition of Zn(acac)2 accelerated not only the deprotection
but also transesterification, leading to the effective formation of
the cross-linking structure of the adhesives.

The dismantlable
adhesion properties of the system using P3a together
with HDI and Zn(acac)2 were also investigated. We checked
the independent additive effect of HDI and Zn(acac)2. As
shown in Table 7, the
adhesion systems including 5 or 10 wt % of HDI showed a high adhesion
strength (9.54–9.92 N/25 mm), similar to the adhesion strength
value in the absence of HDI. After heating at 200 °C for 40 min,
the adhesion strength decreased to half the original values. The addition
of a higher amount of HDI resulted in the lowering of the initial
adhesion strength and no change in the strength after the dismantling
process under similar conditions. In Table 6, the comparison of the insoluble fractions
of P3a in the absence and presence of HDI before and
after heating at 200 °C for 40 min are shown. P3a was soluble in the presence of HDI before heating and it partly
gave an insoluble fraction (59%) after heating. In the presence of
HDI, preheating at 60 °C for 120 min resulted in the formation
of a loose network structure by the reaction of the isocyanate of
HDI and the hydroxy group of the HEA unit in the copolymers. Interestingly,
an increase in the HDI added to the system decreased the insoluble
fraction from 63 to 23% by the addition of 5–15 wt % HDI. The
concentration of HDI at 5.8 wt % corresponded to the amount of the
reacting hydroxy groups included in P3a. A large excess
amount of HDI interrupted the cross-linking during the preheating
process, leading to the formation of the polymer with isocyanate groups
in the side chains, as shown in Scheme 5. The isocyanate groups incorporated in the polymer
side chain further reacted with the hydroxy groups, which were produced
by the deprotection of the BOC group during heating at 200 °C
for 40 min for dismantling. Finally, a highly cross-linked polymer
network structure was formed. The difference in the dismantlable adhesion
properties in Table 7 is accounted for as follows: the preformed loose network structure
interrupted the bubble formation in the adhesive layer. As a result,
the produced carbon oxide and isobutene rapidly diffused to the interface
of the adhesive and the substrate. This was favorable for the interfacial
failure for the dismantling, but the observed failure mode was a mixture
of the interfacial and cohesive ones for the adhesion system in the
presence of HDI.

We next examined the additive
effect of Zn(acac)2 on
the adhesive properties. Previously, it was reported that Zn(acac)2 effectively functioned as the Lewis acid for transesterification
at a high temperature in the self-repairing materials system by dynamic
covalent bonding.64 We found that the addition
of Zn(acac)2 shortened the heating time for dismantling
in our adhesion system. The adhesion strength decreased after a 10
min heating in the presence of Zn(acac)2 (Table 7). The relative adhesion strengths
reached 13% during 20 min heating. The solubility test of the polymers
revealed the remarkable acceleration of the cross-linking reactions
by the addition of Zn(acac)2. A large amount of polymers
was cross-linked to provide the insoluble fraction in a high yield
after heating for only 5 min (Table 6). The void formation by gas evolution was increasingly
observed with an increase in the heating time, as shown in Figure S8. The larger amount of gas evolution
at a shorter time was favored for an effective dismantling process.

For the adhesion system with the simultaneous use of HDI and Zn(acac)2, the adhesion strength was 3.31 ± 0.53 N/25 mm before
heating, and it decreased to 0.48 ± 0.11 N/25 mm after heating
at 200 °C for 20 min. The initial strength value was lower than
that in the absence of HDI and Zn(acac)2. This was because
a cross-linking reaction occurred to produce a loose network structure
even after mixing the adhesive polymers with HDI and Zn(acac)2 without preheating. The rheology measurement proved the formation
of an elastic material before any heat treatment (Figure S9). It was also noteworthy that the interfacial failure
between the substrate and the adhesive layer was completely achieved
in this case. This was due to the high-density network of the adhesive
polymers after heating for dismantling. It exhibited a high elasticity
and cohesion force. The G′ value of the adhesive
after heating for the dismantling (200 °C for 20 min) became
too high to be determined by rheology measurements. After the sufficient
progression of transesterification, i.e., the formation of cross-linking
structures, the peel strength decreased due to its increased modulus.
To design the adhesion system with an ideal interfacial failure, the
forming of a dense network polymer structure was important before
the deprotection of the BOC groups. It was already suggested that
gas bubble formation was suppressed by the presence of a network structure
with a short distance between the cross-linking points because the
suppressed mobility of the polymer chains limited the formation of
a large space needed for the growing gas bubbles.63 As a result, the evolved carbon dioxide and isobutene molecules
diffused in the adhesive layer and were released at the interfaces.
This supported the selective interfacial failure of the present system.

Conclusions
In the present study, we synthesized several
polymers containing
the BHEA repeating unit by radical polymerization, i.e., the homopolymer
of BHEA, P1, the copolymers of BHEA with 2EHA, P2s, and the copolymers of BHEA with 2EHA and HEA, P3s. The BOC groups introduced into the side group of these polymers
degraded at approximately 200 °C to provide the HEA repeating
unit accompanying the evolution of carbon dioxide and isobutene as
gaseous products. The degradation temperature was influenced by the
composition and sequence of the BHEA unit in the copolymers because
the deprotection of the BOC group was accelerated by the autocatalytic
reaction mechanism. On the basis of the results for the 180°
peel test of the pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes using the adhesive
copolymers containing the BOC groups, P2a containing
the BHEA units of 70 mol % and P3b containing the BHEA
units of 26 mol % and the HEA units of 39 mol % exhibited high adhesion
strength required as the pressure-sensitive adhesives and the peel
strength values decreased to less than 10% of the original strength
after heating to 200 °C for 20 min. The use of HDI and Zn(acac)2 as the cross-linker and the Lewis acid was valid for the
quick response and the achievement of the selective interfacial failure,
which were required as the dismantlable adhesion materials. High-performance
adhesion systems including the dismantlable adhesion materials will
become a powerful tool for forthcoming materials design using various
composite materials in combination with dissimilar materials bonding
systems,65 which have been rapidly growing
in recent years.

Experimental Section
General Procedures
The 1H NMR spectra were
recorded using ECS-400 and ECX-400 spectrometers (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) with chloroform-d at room temperature. The
IR spectra were recorded by an FT/IR-4600 spectrometer (JASCO Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan). The polymer solution (10 wt % in toluene) was drop-cast
on a silicon plate and dried at room temperature in vacuo. The number-
and weight-average molecular weights (Mn and Mw, respectively) were determined
by SEC in tetrahydrofuran (flow rate at 0.8 mL/min) as the eluent
at 40 °C using a system consisting of PU-2080-Plus (pump) and
DG-2080-53 (degasser) (JASCO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), CS-300C (thermostat
chamber, Chromato Science, Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), TSKgel GMHHR-N
(column, Tosoh Corporation, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and JASCO RI-2031-Plus
(refractive index detector). The molecular weights were calibrated
using standard polystyrene (Tosoh Corporation, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) were performed using DTG-60 and DSC-60 (Shimadzu Corporation,
Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), respectively, at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
in nitrogen stream (20–50 mL/min). An isothermal TG analysis
was carried out in the temperature range of 90–130 °C.
Scanning electron microscopy observations were carried out using a
VE-9800 (Keyence Corporation, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at an acceleration
voltage of 0.8 kV after Au vapor deposition for cross-section observation
to determine the thickness of the adhesive layers. A tensile lap shear
test was carried out using an Autograph AGS-X 1 kN (Shimadzu Corporation,
Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) at a tensile rate of 300 mm/min. The test pieces
were used for the bonding strength measurement before and after heating
at 200 °C for a specific time as the dismantling process. The
peel strength was determined as an average value of five measurements.
The rheology measurement was carried out using a HAAKE MARS III (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) at the frequency of 0.01–30
Hz (i.e., ω = 0.0628–198.7 rad/s) and 25 °C with
1% strain using parallel plates.

Materials
HDI,
Zn(acac)2, tert-butyl dicarbonate, and
DMAP were purchased from Nacalai Tesque,
Kyoto, Japan, and used as received. 2EHA (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)
and HEA (Tokyo Chemical Industry Corporation, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
were distilled before use. AIBN was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd., Japan, and recrystallized from chloroform. Commercially
available solvents were used without further purification.

Synthesis
of BHEA
To HEA (4.64 g) and tert-butyl dicarbonate
(8.73 g) in 10 mL of toluene, DMAP (0.49 g) was
added and stirred for 24 h at room temperature.42 To the reaction mixture, 40 mL of chloroform was added
and washed with 5% aq HCl (40 mL, three times); then, the organic
layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration,
BHEA was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform/hexane
= 5/5 in volume), followed by evaporation of the solvent under reduced
pressure. Colorless liquid. Yield 7.54g (87%).

1H
NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 6.40 (dd, J = 17.4 Hz and 1.2 Hz, 1H), 6.10 (dd, J = 17.4 Hz
and 10.5 Hz, 1H), 5.82 (dd, J = 10.5 Hz and 1.2 Hz,
1H), 4.34–4.26 (m, 4H), and 1.45 (s, 9H).

Polymerization
BHEA with or without 2HEA and HEA in
anisole (monomers/anisole = 1/4 in weight) was placed in a glass tube,
and oxygen was removed by freeze–thaw cycles (three times).
After polymerization at 60 °C for 3 h, the solution was poured
into a large amount of a methanol/water mixture (9/1 in volume) to
precipitate the polymers. The polymers were isolated by decantation
and purified by repeated precipitations. The polymers were dried at
60 °C under reduced pressure and used for the SEC, NMR, DSC,
and TG measurements. The compositions of the copolymers were determined
by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Deprotection of BOC Groups
On the basis of the peak
intensity change in the IR spectrum during heating, we determined
the conversion of the BOC group to the hydroxy group according to
the following equation  where A0, At, and A∞ are the absorbance before and after heating for a determined and
after infinite times, respectively.

Shear Holding Power Test
The shear holding power test
was performed according to a modified procedure of the standard test
method for shear adhesion of pressure-sensitive tapes (ASTM D3654).
A stainless steel plate (SUS430, 50 mm × 10 mm × 0.5 mm)
was cleaned by ultrasonication in toluene for 15 min and dried in
air at room temperature. Typically, two drops of a toluene solution
of the adhesive polymer (10 wt %) were spread in an area of 10 mm
× 10 mm and dried in vacuo for 2 h, and the mating surfaces were
pressed together. The specimen was clamped and kept at room temperature
for 30 min. The adhered area was fixed at 100 mm2 (10 mm
× 10 mm overlap joint). Various weights in the range of 4.9–100
g were used and we recorded the time to failure (Tf) and/or the creep distance after 60 min (L60) at room temperature. Typically, the average value
of three measurements was adopted.

180° Peel Test
The adhesion tests were performed
according to the standard test method for the peel adhesion of pressure-sensitive
tape (ASTM D3330) using a universal testing machine, an Autograph
AGS-X with a 1 kN (at maximum) load cell. A toluene solution of the
adhesive polymers (15 wt %) was coated at a thickness of 100 μm
on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film (50 μm thickness)
using a film applicator (Tester Sangyo Corporation, Ltd., Saitama,
Japan) and dried overnight under reduced pressure at room temperature.
The thickness of the adhesive layer was 8 μm. A strip of the
PET film (25 mm width) coated with the adhesive polymers was placed
on a stainless steel plate (SUS430, 50 mm × 150 mm × 0.5
mm) and then pressed using a 2 kg hand roller at the rate of 20 mm/s
(twice). For the thermal treatment at 200 °C, the test piece
was placed in a preheated oven for a predetermined time, removed from
the oven, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The 180°
peel tests were carried out after the specimen was left to stand for
30 min at room temperature. The tensile rate was 300 mm/min. All of
the adhesion tests were performed at 25 °C. The average value
of five measurements was recorded. For the adhesive materials containing
HDI, the mixture of the adhesive polymer and HDI in toluene was heated
at 60 °C for 120 min in the presence or absence of (Zn(acac)2).
