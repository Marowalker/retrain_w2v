Inositol
monophosphatase (IMPase) is a crucial enzyme for the biosynthesis
of phosphatidylinositol, an essential component in mycobacterial cell
walls. IMPase A (ImpA) from Mycobacterium smegmatis is a bifunctional enzyme that also functions as a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
(FBPase). To better understand the bifunctional nature of this enzyme,
point mutagenesis was conducted on several key residues and their
enzyme activity was tested. Our results along with active site models
support the fact that ImpA is a bifunctional enzyme with residues
Gly94, Thr95 hypothesized to be contributing to the FBPase activity
and residues Trp220, Asp221 hypothesized to be contributing to the
IMPase activity. Double mutants, W220A + D221A reduced both FBPase
and IMPase activity drastically while the double mutant G94A + T95A
surprisingly partially restored the IMPase activity compared to the
single mutants. This study establishes the foundation toward obtaining
a better understanding of the bifunctional nature of this enzyme.

==== Body
Introduction
Most enzymes are specific for the substrates
they act upon. However,
many enzymes are found to have broad substrate specificity. Diversity
of an enzyme may be important for survival of an organism and could
be the product of evolution. This would explain why a secondary function
of one enzyme could share the primary function in other members of
the same family.1,2 Enzymes that are multifunctional
are present in many organisms and in many different enzyme families.
The broad specificity classically involves the same systematic approach
to multiple substrates or can use an altered catalytic mechanism within
the active site.1,2

The enzyme inositol monophosphatase
(IMPase) is crucial for the
biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and is an essential component
of mycobacteria. IMPase belongs to the family of enzymes which hydrolyses
phosphate groups of sugar phosphates. Unlike other sugar phosphatases,
it is a bifunctional enzyme which hydrolyses two different substrates,
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and inositol-1-phosphate. IMPase requires
Mg2+ for its activity but does not require any coenzymes.
Previous studies have shown that the Rv2131c gene product of Mycobacterium tuberculosis displays the IMPase activity
with a broad substrate specificity compared to other known IMPases.3,4

Inositol is not specific for mycobacteria; however, the major
immunomodulatory
components of the mycobacterial cell wall are phosphatidyl-based lipids
such as PI mannosides (PIM). Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to inositol-1-phosphate
and is dephosphorylated by IMPase to form myo-inositol.5 Inositol is biosynthesized as shown below (Figure 1).5

Figure 1 Suggested inositol metabolism pathway.5

Inositol is a component of lipoarabinomannan,
which in turn is
found in high levels in the mycobacterial cell envelope, anchored
by a PI moiety. Lipomannan and PIM are also found in the cell envelope.
PI-containing molecules have shown to be essential for Mycobacterium smegmatis. Inositol is also involved
in the production of mycothiol, which helps maintain the redox state
of the cell.4,6

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
(FBPase, EC 3.1.3.11), a key enzyme
of gluconeogenesis, catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
to form fructose-6-phosphate and orthophosphate. Fructose-6-phosphate
is an important precursor in various biosynthetic pathways generating
important structural components of the cell wall and glycolipids in
mycobacteria.7

Thus, IMPase is an
important enzyme that produces two different
important precursors for synthesizing other cell components. Although
the bifunctional nature of IMPase is known, it is not clear whether
both activities involve a common active site. In this paper, we describe
the nature of IMPase duality through point mutations of residues known
to have catalytic significance. We show that in M.
smegmatis, conserved residues from both putative active
sites regulate both IMPAse and FBPase activities.

Results and Discussion
The enzyme IMPase is crucial for
the biosynthesis of PI, an essential
component of mycobacteria. IMPase is responsible for dephosphorylating
inositol-1-phosphate to inositol. The FBPase enzyme dephosphorylates
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. Earlier studies
have shown that the Rv2131c gene product of M. tuberculosis (CysQ), displays the IMPase activity alongside the FBPase activity.3,4 This study focuses on the enzyme IMPase A (ImpA) from M. smegmatis, which is homologous to CysQ and carries
the same dual functionality.

To investigate the nature of duality
of action, we successfully
expressed and purified ImpA from M. smegmatis. We determined the conditions for the optimal enzyme activity which
included temperature, time, enzyme and substrate concentrations, and
buffer conditions (data not shown). We also determined the Km values for both the functionalities of ImpA
and found that both activities show very similar Km values (Figure 2). The Km values are in agreement
with Km values for CysQ IMPase.8

Figure 2 Lineweaver–Burke plots of wild type ImpA protein
tested
for both IMPase activities with the substrate inositol-1-phosphate
and the FBPase activity, with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate as the substrate.
The Km is 11.5 μM for the IMPase
activity and 11.1 μM for the FBPase activity with p < 0.001.

Our next goal was to
understand whether the two active sites are
independent of each other. To do this, we conducted mutational analysis
of key residues that we hypothesized to be involved in the two activities.
The residues were selected based on sequence analysis with other known
FBPase and IMPase enzymes.

Known structures and amino acid sequences
of close homologs of
IMPases in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis were examined. In M. tuberculosis the homologs are ImpA, SuhB (or ImpB), CysQ, and ImpC (Rv3137). Only ImpC is
shown to be essential for growth and probably in the early synthesis
of mycothiol.4 Crystal structures of SuhB
(PDB ID 2Q74) and CysQ (PDB ID 5DJG) were found to align well with root mean squared deviation (rmsd)
of only 1.6 Å. The SuhB structure has an ADP in its active site.
The conserved region predicted by PROSITE was shown to be the active
site of the IMPase activity M. tuberculosis. This site was structurally conserved in these two enzymes.9 The start of the conserved sites 220WD221 was highly conserved among ImpA, SubB, CysQ, ImpC,
and ImpB in M. tuberculosis(4) and is shown in Figure 3. Sequence comparisons with select other
IMPases show that in the ImpA protein, these two residues are in close
proximity of ADP in SuhB.10

Figure 3 The primary sequence
alignment of different IMPases and FBPases.
All proteins share the motif DPIDGT as the key active site for the
phosphatase activity and are indicated on the alignment. All IMPases
also share a conserved motif, which in ImpA is 220WDHAAGVALVRAAGGV235, that is not present in the class II FBPases. The enzymes
listed, in order, are ImpA from M. smegmatis (accession ID A0QX68), ImpA from M. tuberculosis (accession ID O53907), SuhB (accession ID P9WKI9), CysQ (accession ID P9WKJ1), and ImpC
(accession ID P95189) from M. tuberculosis, GlpX from Francisella tularensis (accession ID A0A0G2RPD3)
and GlpX from M. tuberculosis (accession
ID P9WN21). Sequence alignment created with Clustal Omega.11,12 Asterisks (*) below the aligned residues indicate a fully conserved
residue. Colons (:) and periods (.) indicates conservation among residues
with strongly similar and weakly similar properties, respectively.

It appears that the two conserved
amino acids W220 and D221 may
play a role in the IMPase activity. To confirm this possibility, we
created single mutants, where W220 or D221 were separately mutated
to alanine, or double mutants where both residues were mutated to
alanine. The IMPase and FBPase activity was studied in each of these
mutants (Figure 4).
Our results show that both FBPase and IMPase activities were impacted
by these mutations, with approximately 60–70% loss of activity
in each of the single mutants, whereas double mutation completely
abolishes both IMPase and FBPase activity. These results indicate
that the enzyme might use the same active site residues for both activities
or it may be possible that the active sites are separate but could
be in close proximity in the tertiary structure. Enzymes with broad
specificity often have the same active site. Several studies have
reported enzymes in nucleotide synthesis, amylases, and several glycolytic
hydrolases use the same active site for bifunctionality.13,14

Figure 4 Wild
type and the IMPase mutant activities using both inositol-1-phosphate
and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate as the substrate, testing for enzymatic
IMPase and FBPase activity, respectively. The double mutant W220A
+ D221A showed no appreciable levels of enzyme activity.

To better understand how these two activities are
connected double
mutants of both FBPase and IMPase putative active sites were created.
Activities were measured and the results indicated that the IMPase
double mutant W220A + D221A drastically reduced both FBPase and IMPase
activities (Figure 4). These mutational studies implied that both activities may be connected
either by sharing active sites or by the active sites being in close
proximity.

The sequence of ImpA was compared with other known
FBPase and IMPase
sequences (Figure 3). IMPase shares active site for the FBPase activity, which is similar
to other phosphatases,15 specifically sharing
the motif DPIDGT, as previously cited among other phosphatases.16,17 We mutated T95 in the highly conserved FBPase motif to Ala and Ser
separately and measured both FBPase and IMPase activities in these
mutants. Unexpectedly, both T95A and T95S mutants not only affected
the FBPase activity but also affected IMPase activity (Figure 5). The serine mutation (with
the more highly conserved amino acid change) showed only 35% loss
of activity, which could be due to the similarity in size and structure
of serine and threonine. However, mutation to alanine resulted in
a 60% loss of FBPase activity and 85% loss of IMPase activity (Figure 5), lending further
support to the possibility that the two active sites are in close
proximity in the tertiary structure.

Figure 5 Wild type and the FBPase mutant activities
using both inositol-1-phosphate
and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate as the substrate, testing for enzymatic
IMPase and FBPase activity, respectively (p <
0.001).

We further mutated two residues
G94 and T95 of putative FBPase
active site to alanine and measured both activities. With the FBPase
double mutant G94A + T95A, the results were unexpected as this mutant
did not significantly impact either FBPase or IMPase enzyme activity
(Figure 5). Glycine
is a unique amino acid in that it contains hydrogen as its side chain.
Glycine can reside in parts of protein structures that are conserved
and substitution with any other amino acids (e.g. tight turns in structures)
will affect the function of a protein.14 We observed that single Gly to Ala (G94A) mutation decreased both
activities, which was not surprising. Only about 30–40% activity
was lost compared to other mutants (Figure 5). If both residues play a role in the active
site of FBPase then a total loss in activity should have been apparent.
Our results indicated that the double mutants G94A + T95A partially
restored FBPase and IMPase activities when compared to the single
mutants.14,18,19 The partial
restoration of the activity by the double mutant (G94A + T95A) was
thought to be the result of change in the active site structure.

To understand how these mutants could alter the putative active
site structure, we used PEP-FOLD3 to analyze the predicted structure
of these mutants.20,21 The G94A + T95A mutants showed
an interesting change in the structure. In the native enzyme, the 94GT95 region showed an open loop structure, and
in the T95S mutant, there was no appreciable change in the loop-like
structure. The G94A mutant on the other hand displayed a shorter ribbon-like
structure compared to the wildtype enzyme. In the T95A mutant, according
to the PEP-FOLD3 prediction, the loop structure was altered to a helical
structure, probably causing reduced activity. The double mutant, G94A
+ T95A (Figure 6) also
showed a helical structure with a ribbon-like extension at the end
of helix. However, both catalytic activities were not reduced drastically,
suggesting that the helical structure and ribbon-like extension may
bring other residues in close proximity of the IMPase site and make
a bigger loop to accommodate the substrate comfortably. A similar
mechanism has been proposed for a bifunctional IMPase/FBPase enzyme
in Archaeoglobus fulgidus.9

Figure 6 PEP-FOLD3 folding predictions20,21 of the peptide
sequences for the lithium sensitive phosphatase active site. The wild
type (shown on left) has a sequence from ImpA 88VLDPIDGTFNYAAG101. The mutant in the image is G94A + T95A and has the sequence
of VLDPIDAAFNYAAG.

The IMPase active site
double mutant (W220A + D221A) showed a drastic
change in the structure, which possibly resulted in the loss of both
FBPase and IMPase activities. The PEP-FOLD3 predictions of the helix
in the IMPase site showed that the two residues, Trp220 and Asp221were
exposed on the same side, whereas in the double mutant a tighter helical
structure was formed (Figure 7).

Figure 7 PEP-FOLD3 predictions20,21 of the peptide sequences
for the highly conserved IMPase active site. The wild type (shown
on left) has a sequence from impA 214SFGHHIWDHAAGVA227.

In summary, the IMPase
active site double mutant involving W220A
+ D221A, reduced both IMPase and FBPase activities significantly,
whereas the FBPase active site double mutant, G94A + T95A did not
significantly impact both catalytic activities. Our results, along
with active site models, imply that W220 and D221 are critical for
IMPase and FBPase activity. G94 and T95 play a role in catalysis for
both activities but do not significantly impact catalytic rates. This
indicates that it is possible that the highly conserved residues of
Gly94, Thr95, Trp220, and Asp221 are a part of the same active site.
Crystallographic investigation of the ImpA protein is currently underway
and these structures will provide further insight into the nature
of the active site and the possible mechanism of action.

Materials and
Methods
Materials were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Waltham,
MA),
unless otherwise noted. Primers were purchased from IDT DNA Inc. through
the UIC core facility.

Cloning and Purification
In order
to express recombinant
ImpA, the coding sequence of M. smegmatisImpA was amplified by PCR using primers ImpA-forward
(in which the start codon has been changed from GTG to ATG; 5′-GGAATTCCATATGACGGTGGTGGG-3′)
and ImpA-reverse (CGAGGATCCACTCACAGGTAATCC) (accession ID: M. smegmatis, ImpA, A0QX68). These primers introduced an NdeI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI at the 3′ end to allow the gene to be cloned in-frame into
the expression vector pET-15b. PCR was carried out using the Invitrogen
Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity with M. smegmatis DNA as the template. The PCR product was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the vector pET-15b to
give a construct that expresses a protein with a 21 residue amino-terminal
extension containing a histidine tag. The plasmid was then transformed
into BL21 DE3 PlysS Escherichia coli cells for protein purification.

Purification and expression
of the ImpA protein was performed via a Ni-NTA column according to
previously established protocols for purification of other phosphatase
enzymes.17,22 Bacterial strains were grown on media containing
ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) and chloramphenicol (0.34 mg/mL) and grown
overnight at 37 °C. IPTG was added to a final concentration of
0.5 mM and the culture was incubated at 30 °C on the shaker incubator
for an additional 6 h5−8 and harvested via centrifuge.

Cells were resuspended in buffer
containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and
500 mM NaCl and lysed via sonication. It was then centrifuged and
run through a Ni-NTA column equilibrated with the primary buffer containing
10 mM imidazole. The column was further washed with buffer containing
20 mM imidazole. Protein was eluted with buffer containing 200 mM
imidazole. Eluate was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal
filter. Further purification was performed with size exclusion chromatography
using a GE ÄKTA FPLC.22

Point Mutagenesis
The pET15b plasmid containing the
wild type ImpA was used for mutagenesis. Forward primers and their
reverse complements were designed to replace specific residue positions
as described in Table 1. Site directed mutagenesis for each mutation followed the same protocol
and was performed using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Agilent Technologies) as per manufacturers protocol and transformed
to XL-10 Gold Ultracompetent Cells (Agilent Technologies). Plasmids
were extracted and transformed into BL21 DE3 PlysS competent cells
for protein expression. Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing.

Enzyme Activity Assays
To measure
the enzyme activity,
a malachite green assay was used to measure phosphate release, as
described previously.17 Protein of each
the wildtype and mutants were added in equal concentrations to the
substrate (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate or inositol-1-phosphate) with
a final concentration of 15 μM. A negative control containing
only the reaction buffer was also tested. Reaction buffer contained
50 mM KCl, 20 mM tricine at pH 8.0, 8 mM MgCl2, and 15
nM enzyme. The malachite green solution was added after 6 min and
then incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance levels were
read at 630 nm.

The results confirmed the FBPase activity via
a coupled assay by measuring production of NADPH at 340 nm, was used
to determine enzymatic parameters and analyzed with a nonlinear fit
of Michaelis–Menten equation using Excel. Using the coupled
assay, the following optimal conditions were found where FBPaseII
is the limiting reagent: 5 units/mL of phosphoglucoisomerase, 2 units/mL
of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.3 mM NADP+, 15
μM F16BP, and 50 nM FBPaseII. The reaction was monitored for
3.5 min. The residual activity after heating was assessed by incubating
protein samples for 30 min at various temperatures in a water bath
(10–80 °C), returning to ice for 15 min and assaying against
a sample on ice for the same length of time.
