A new type of deacetylated cellulose
acetate (DA)@polydopamine
(PDA) composite nanofiber membrane was fabricated by electrospinning
and surface modification. The membrane was applied as a highly efficient
adsorbent for removing methylene blue (MB) from an aqueous solution.
The morphology, surface chemistry, surface wettability, and effects
of operating conditions on MB adsorption ability, as well as the equilibrium,
kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanism of adsorption, were systematically
studied. The results demonstrated that a uniform PDA coating layer
was successfully developed on the surface of DA nanofibers. The adsorption
capacity of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane reached up to 88.2 mg/g
at a temperature of 25 °C and a pH of 6.5 after adsorption for
30 h, which is about 8.6 times higher than that of DA nanofibers.
The experimental results showed that the adsorption behavior of DA@PDA
composite nanofibers followed the Weber’s intraparticle diffusion
model, pseudo-second-order model, and Langmuir isothermal model. A
thermodynamic analysis indicated that endothermic, spontaneous, and
physisorption processes occurred. Based on the experimental results,
the adsorption mechanism of DA@PDA composite nanofibers was also demonstrated.

1 Introduction
In recent years, with
the fast-developing dye-related industry,
a massive quantity of dye wastewater is continuously discharged to
the water,1 which has been a huge threat
to the ecological environment and human health. Methylene blue (MB)
is a commonly used cationic dye that can form a stable solution with
water at room temperature.2,3 It is harmful to human
health above a certain concentration due to its strong toxicity. In
addition, almost all dyes are difficult to biodegrade and have some
resistance to environmental conditions, making sewage treatment an
urgent project.4,5 Therefore, it is particularly
important to develop effective and low-cost materials to remove MB
and other dyes from wastewater and refresh the environment.

Nowadays, physical, chemical, and biological treatment methods
have been extensively applied to remove dye wastewater.6,7 However, those methods have disadvantages of high energy consumption,
high cost, and abundant toxic by-products. Therefore, most researchers
have paid attention to the adsorption method due to its simple operation
process, low cost, abundant adsorbent materials, easy recycling, and
high efficiency.8−10 A lot of adsorbents, such as activated carbon, zeolite,
orange peel, wheat shells, SiO2, metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs), and so forth,11−15 have been researched and applied. Activated carbon is a commonly
used adsorbent, but its high price and non-renewable sources limit
its application in the adsorption field.16 SiO2 and MOF adsorbents have the disadvantage of indirect
pollution to the environment during the preparation process.17,18

Polymer membranes with micro- and nanostructures have attracted
great interest from researchers because of their high specific surface
area, high adsorption capacity, and low secondary pollution. Electrospinning
as a simple preparation method to fabricate nanofiber membranes has
been widely applied.19,20 A nanofiber membrane prepared
by electrospinning showed a large specific surface area, high porosity,
and excellent pore interconnectivity and has been extensively used
in tissue engineering, oil/water separation, catalytic, energy, adsorption
fields, and so forth.21 The main purpose
of this study is to prepare an environmentally friendly cellulose
acetate (CA) nanofiber membrane via electrospinning that is capable
of adsorbing and removing MB from water solution.

CA, which
is a member of the most important class of cellulose
derivatives, has been widely used in the adsorption field because
of its abundant natural sources, good biodegradability, low cost,
and easy processing.22 Demirci et al. prepared
a CA nanofiber membrane by electrospinning and then modified its surface
by cationic polymer brushes that were used to adsorb the target DNA.
The results showed that the modified CA nanofiber membrane was a good
adsorbent for the purification and filtration of DNA.23 Celebioglu et al. fabricated a CA nanofiber membrane by
electrospinning and then modified it with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD),
which was used to remove phenanthrene from an aqueous solution. The
results showed that the β-CD-modified CA nanofiber membrane
demonstrated better removal of phenanthrene than the CA nanofiber
membrane alone.24 Tian et al. fabricated
a CA nanofiber membrane by electrospinning and then modified it with
poly(methacrylic acid), which was used to adsorb heavy metal ions.
The results showed that the poly(methyl methacrylate)-modified CA
nanofiber membrane had a good adsorption capacity and good re-usability
for heavy metal ions.25 CA nanofiber membranes
have been widely used as matrix materials for adsorption due to their
above-mentioned advantages. However, in order to improve the adsorption
performance and extend its application, the CA nanofiber membrane
needs to be modified due to its limited surface groups and chemistry
properties.

A polydopamine (PDA) coating has been developed
as a facile and
universal method for the surface modification of various materials.
A strong interface adhesion can be formed between PDA and any type
of material due to the presence of abundant catechol and amine groups.
Many researches have shown that PDA microspheres act as good adsorbents
and have a high adsorption efficiency for heavy metal ions and dyes.26−28 However, PDA microspheres are difficult to recycle and reuse. Therefore,
in this study, a CA nanofiber membrane was fabricated by electrospinning
as the matrix, and then its surface was modified by a PDA coating
layer to be used as an adsorbent with highly efficient and good re-utilization
for removing MB from the aqueous solution. Although PDA can be easily
deposited on any type of surface, it is a time-consuming process and
demonstrates poor uniformity.29−31 In order to improve the uniformity
and to reduce the coating time for the PDA coating layer, the CA nanofiber
membrane was first deacetylated to obtain a deacetylated cellulose
acetate (DA) membrane before the PDA coating process.

In this
study, the CA nanofiber membrane was first fabricated by
electrospinning. Then, it was deacetylated by immersing it into a
NaOH solution to obtain the DA nanofiber membrane. Finally, its surface
was modified by a PDA coating layer to obtain the DA@PDA nanofiber
membrane. The morphology, surface chemistry, surface wettability,
and effects of operating conditions on the MB adsorption ability,
as well as the equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanism
of adsorption, were systematically studied.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Surface Chemical Structure
of CA, DA, and
DA@PDA Nanofiber Membranes
The Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of CA and DA nanofiber membranes under
different deacetylation times are illustrated in Figure 1a. For the CA nanofiber membrane,
the peaks at 1740 and 1234 cm–1 were attributed
to C=O and C–O–C, respectively.32 After deacetylation for 5, 10, and 10 h, for DA-5, DA-10,
and DA-20 nanofiber membranes, respectively, the peak at 1740 cm–1 attributed to C=O disappeared, while a new
peak at 3394 cm–1 attributed to −OH appeared,
thus indicating that the CA nanofiber membranes were successfully
deacetylated.

different
deacetylation times of 5, 10, and 20 h. (b) Deacetylation degree (DD
%) of DA nanofiber membranes under different deacetylation times of
5, 10, and 20 h. (c) FTIR spectra of the PDA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber
membranes. (d) Schematic illustration of the surface modification
of the CA nanofiber membrane through deacetylation and the PDA coating
process.

Under different deacetylation
times, the value of DD % is provided
in Figure 1b. The DD
% of DA-5, DA-10, and DA-20 nanofiber membranes were 34.18, 62.13,
and 63.91%, respectively, suggesting that the DD % increased with
the increasing deacetylation time. It is believed that the higher
the DD % was generated, the more hydroxyl groups were present. It
was also found that the DD % of DA nanofiber membranes showed no obvious
change after deacetylating for 10 h. Therefore, the DA-10 nanofiber
membrane was chosen to prepare the DA-10@PDA nanofiber membrane. If
not otherwise specified, DA@PDA has been used instead of DA-10@PDA
in the text.

Figure 1c provides
the FTIR spectra of PDA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes. For PDA,
the peak at 3300 cm–1 was attributed to the stretching
vibration of phenolic −OH and −NH2, the peak
at 1610 cm–1 was attributed to the stretching vibration
of the aromatic ring and the bending vibration of N–H, and
the peak at 1510 cm–1 was attributed to the N–H
shearing vibration of the amide group. For the DA nanofiber, the peak
at 3380 cm–1 was attributed to the stretching vibration
of O–H, the peak at 1310 cm–1 was attributed
to the stretching vibration of C–OH, and the peak at 1160 cm–1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of C–O.
For the DA@PDA composite nanofiber, its peaks were consistent with
the peaks from both the DA nanofiber and PDA particles, thus implying
their coexistence. Moreover, compared with the DA nanofiber and PDA
particles, the peaks at 3380, 1510, 1310, and 1160 cm–1 in DA and PDA shifted to a lower wavenumber and changed to 3354,
1508, 1305, and 1157 cm–1 for the DA@PDA composite
nanofiber. The peak at 1610 cm–1 on PDA transformed
into a higher wavenumber and changed to 1630 cm–1 for the DA@PDA composite nanofiber. This is because hydrogen bonding
occurred between the DA nanofibers and the PDA coating layers. These
results indicate that the PDA coating layer was successfully coated
on the DA nanofiber, and a chemical interaction between the DA and
PDA molecules also formed.

Figure 1d provides
a schematic illustration of the surface modification of the CA nanofiber
membrane through deacetylation and the PDA coating process. After
deacetylation, most of the ester groups (−O=C–O)
in the CA nanofibers changed to hydroxyl groups (−OH) in the
DA nanofibers. After PDA coating, the PDA coating layer adhered tightly
to the surface of the DA nanofiber and a strong hydrogen bonding occurred
between the phenolic O–H and N–H groups of the PDA coating
layers and the hydroxyl groups of the DA nanofibers.

2.2 Morphology of CA, DA, and DA@PDA Nanofiber
Membranes
Figure 2 provides the morphology of pure CA and DA nanofibers with
different deacetylation times of 5, 10, and 20 h. It can be seen that
the CA, DA-5, DA-10, and DA-20 nanofibers retained their regular and
good nanofiber morphology. Compared with CA nanofibers, after deacetylation,
the average diameter of the DA nanofiber was lower than that of the
CA nanofiber. The average diameters of the DA-5, DA-10, and DA-20
nanofibers were about 430, 390, and 360 nm, respectively, which decreased
with an increasing deacetylation time.32 This could be because the ester groups (−O=C–O)
of the CA nanofibers transformed into hydroxyl groups (−OH)
for DA after deacetylation, which made the compactness among molecular
chains increase due to the increase in the molecular arrangement regularity
and the interaction between molecular chains.

of (a) pure CA, (b) DA-5, (c) DA-10, and (d) DA-20 nanofibers.

Figure 3a,b show
the morphology of CA@PDA and DA@PDA composite nanofibers. The PDA
coating time was 10 h. It can be seen that for the CA@PDA composite
nanofibers, the PDA particles were not only attached to the surface
of the CA nanofibers, but also aggregated in the space between nanofibers,
leading to the blocking of the space between nanofibers. Interestingly,
from Figure 3b, it
can be seen that most of the PDA particles were coated along the fiber
direction and formed a homogeneous PDA coating layer on the nanofiber
surface. It also can be seen that the average diameter of DA@PDA composite
nanofibers (590 nm) was larger than that of CA@PDA composite nanofibers
(490 nm). This was because the abundant hydroxyl groups in the DA
nanofibers acted as active sites to guide the PDA particles that accumulated
along the fiber direction during the coating process. This significantly
increased the uniformity of the PDA coating layer.

and (b) DA@PDA composite nanofibers. (c)

of CA, DA, CA@PDA, and DA@PDA composite nanofibers.

To further observe the structure of DA@PDA composite nanofibers,
the cross section of DA@PDA composite nanofibers is shown in Figure 3c. Prior to observation
by SEM, the sample was fractured using liquid nitrogen. It can be
found that the typical core–shell structure was formed with
DA nanofibers as the core and the PDA coating layer as the shell. Figure 3d provides the porosity
of CA, CA@PDA, DA, and DA@PDA composite nanofibers. The porosity of
DA slightly decreased in comparison with that of CA nanofibers. The
porosity of CA@PDA and DA@PDA composite nanofibers were lower than
that of corresponding CA and DA nanofibers due to the formation of
the PDA coating layer on their surface.

2.3 Hydrophilicity
and Specific Surface Area of
DA@PDA Nanofiber Membranes
The water contact angle (WCA)
of CA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes are shown in Figure 4a. The WCA of the CA nanofiber
membrane was 115°, showing a typical hydrophobic profile. As
expected, the WCAs of DA and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes were about
0°, exhibiting a super-hydrophilic profile due to the existence
of a large number of hydrophilic groups (hydroxyl groups), which will
be beneficial for adsorption. The specific surface area of adsorbents
is one of the major factors that influence their adsorption capacity
when using them to remove dyes from aqueous solutions. Figure 4b provides the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane obtained at 77 K. The specific
surface area of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane was calculated as 15.66
m2/g by the standard Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, which was larger than that of traditional PDA microspheres
(13.77 m2/g).33 This means that
the higher is the specific surface area of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane,
the more contact there is between the MB molecules and the adsorption
sites and the larger the potential adsorption capacity is of the DA@PDA
nanofiber membranes for MB.

adsorption–desorption isotherm obtained at 77 K for the DA@PDA
nanofiber membrane.

2.4 MB Dye
Adsorption Uptake
The adsorption
uptake of CA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes with increasing adsorption
time for the adsorbing MB dye is shown in Figure 5a. It can be seen that the adsorption rate
significantly decreased with the increasing adsorption time during
the initial adsorption time and then remained stable. This indicates
that the MB concentration had an obvious effect on the adsorption
rate of the adsorbent. During the beginning of adsorption, the larger
the MB concentration, the more the contact chance between the MB molecules
and the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane, resulting in a higher adsorption
rate. After adsorption for 24 h, the MB adsorption reached a saturated
state and the adsorption uptake of the CA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber
membranes were 4.9, 10.2, and 88.2 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption
uptake of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane was about 8.6 and 18 times
higher than that of the DA and CA nanofiber membranes, respectively.
This result indicated that the adsorption is essentially an equilibrium
process. An increasing MB concentration will increase the driving
force for the adsorption and, of course, would promote the adsorption.34

membranes
with increasing adsorption time for the adsorbing MB dye. (b) Digital
photographs of the MB solution after being immersed in the representative
CA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes. (c) SEM image of the DA@PDA
composite nanofiber after MB adsorption for 24 h. (Adsorption conditions:
iriginal MB concentration was 50 mg/L, weight of adsorbent was 10
mg, temperature was 298 K, and pH was 6.5.)

Digital photographs of the MB solution under different adsorption
times are shown in Figure 5b. When the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane was used as the adsorbent,
the color of the MB solution varied from dark blue to light blue.
It finally became nearly transparent with the increasing adsorption
time, which suggests that most of the MB molecules in the solution
were adsorbed by the CA@PDA nanofiber membrane. When CA and DA nanofiber
membranes were used as the adsorbents, the color of the MB solution
experienced no obvious change with the increasing adsorption time
and remained dark blue after adsorbing for 24 h. From Figure 5c, it can be seen that many
MB particles were adsorbed on the surface of the DA@PDA composite
nanofiber, further implying the outstanding adsorption ability of
the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane toward MB.

2.5 Effects
of Original MB Solution pH and Concentration
Figure 6a provides
the effect of the original MB solution pH on the adsorption capacity
of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane. It can be found that the adsorption
capacity of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane significantly increased
with the increasing MB solution pH, from 1.43 to 92.64 mg/g when the
solution pH ranged from 2 to 10. An MB removal rate of up to 93.21%
was reached when the pH of the MB solution was 10, which indicates
that the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane could be used as a high-efficiency
adsorbent for the adsorbing MB. Furthermore, an alkaline solution
was helpful for adsorbing MB. This was primarily because when the
MB solution was acidic, the functional group (amino group) from the
PDA protonated and presented a positive charge, while electrostatic
repulsion occurred between the cationic MB molecule and the positively
charged active sites of the adsorbent, resulting in a decrease of
adsorption capacity.35 However, when the
MB solution was alkaline, the phenol group from the PDA deprotonated
and presented a negative charge, and a strong electrostatic attraction
occurred between the cationic MB molecule and the negatively charged
active sites of the adsorbent, resulting in an increase in the adsorption
capacity.36Figure 6b provides the zeta potential of the DA@PDA
nanofiber membrane at different pH values, which shows the surface
charge changes of the adsorbent. It can be seen that the isoelectric
point (point of zero charge) of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane was
about 4.6. When the solution pH is below 4.6, the DA@PDA nanofiber
membrane showed a positive surface charge due to the protonation of
the amino groups. And the electrostatic repulsion occurred between
the positively charged active sites on the adsorbent and the cationic
dye molecules, which will result in a decrease in the adsorption capacity
of the adsorbent. When the solution pH value was above 4.6, the DA@PDA
nanofiber membrane showed a negative surface charge due to the deprotonation
of the phenolic groups, which will result in an increase in the MB
removal efficiency.

Figure 6 (a) Effect of the original MB solution pH on the adsorption
ability
of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane; (b) zeta potential of the DA@PDA
nanofiber membrane at different pH values (adsorption conditions:
original MB concentration was 50 mg/L, weight of the adsorbent was
10 mg, temperature was 298 K, and adsorption time was 24 h). (c) The
effect of the original MB solution concentration on the adsorption
ability of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane (adsorption conditions: temperature
was 298 K, pH was 6.5, and weight of the adsorbent was 10 mg).

Figure 6c shows
the effect of the original concentration of MB solution on the adsorption
capacity of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane. At the beginning of adsorption,
the adsorption rate was high. It significantly decreased with the
increasing adsorption time and reached equilibrium after adsorbing
for 24 h. This was because, at the beginning of adsorption, a large
number of active adsorption sites on the surface of the DA@PDA nanofiber
membrane could be used, causing a fast adsorption rate. However, more
and more active adsorption sites became occupied by the MB molecules
with the increasing adsorption time. Furthermore, a strong repulsive
force was generated between the adsorbed MB ions and the unadsorbed
MB ions, making the remaining sites more and more difficult to occupy,
until reaching an equilibrium state of adsorption and desorption.36 The equilibrium adsorption capacity of DA@PDA
nanofiber membranes increased as the original MB solution concentration
increased. This can be attributed to the fact that the higher original
MB solution concentration provided a larger driving force to break
through the mass transfer resistance of the MB.37 These results showed that the adsorption process largely
relied on the original MB solution pH and concentration.

2.6 Kinetic Analysis
The pseudo-first-order
model and pseudo-second-order model were used to understand the adsorption
kinetics, as shown in Figure 7a,b. The two adsorption models can be expressed by eqs 1 and 2(38,39) 1   2  where qe (mg/g)
is the amount of adsorbed MB at equilibrium, qt (mg/g) is the amount of adsorbed MB at time t, and K1 (min–1) and K2 (g/mg·min) are the pseudo-first-order
rate constant and the pseudo-second-order rate constant, respectively.
The pseudo-first-order kinetic model is based on the assumption that
the adsorption process is the physical adsorption. The second-order
model is based on the assumption that the adsorption process is the
chemical adsorption, including the electron sharing and electron transfer
between the adsorbent and adsorbate.

Figure 7 (a) Pseudo-first-order kinetic model.
(b) Pseudo-second-order kinetic
model. (c) Intraparticle diffusion model of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane
for adsorbing MB (adsorption conditions: temperature was 298 K, and
pH was 6.5).

The kinetic parameters of K1, K2, and qe, as well
as the correlation coefficients (R2),
were obtained by linear regression. It can be seen that the theoretical
value of the adsorption capacity calculated by the pseudo-second-order
model was 96.90 mg/g, which was closer to the experimental value of
the adsorption capacity (88.2 mg/g). Moreover, the R2 (0.999) of the pseudo-second-order model was larger
than that of the pseudo-first-order model. Those results indicated
that the adsorption process of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane followed
the pseudo-second-order model rather than the pseudo-first-order model.

The Weber’s intraparticle diffusion model was applied to
study the steps of the adsorption process, as shown in eq 3 3  where ki (mg/g·min)
represents the intraparticle diffusion rate constant. Parameter c (mg/g) is the intercept under different adsorption processes.
The intraparticle diffusion process curves of the MB adsorbed onto
the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane are shown in Figure 7c.

The adsorption process can be divided
into two steps. The first
step is the film diffusion stage; that is, the MB molecules diffuse
from the solution to the outer surface of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane.
The second step is the intraparticle diffusion stage, which is affected
by the surface morphology and number of void sites of the DA@PDA nanofiber
membrane. Parameter Ki1 was significantly
larger than Ki2, which indicates that
the intraparticle diffusion stage was a gentle process. The intercept
at the second stage was larger than that at the first stage, indicating
more contribution of surface adsorption in the rate-controlling step
due to the boundary layer effect. Moreover, the values of R12 and R22 in the two steps were 0.99672 and 0.92274, respectively,
meaning that the Weber’s intraparticle diffusion model had
good applicability in studying the adsorption process.40

2.7 Adsorption Isotherm
The Langmuir
and Freundlich models were applied to study the equilibrium adsorption
isotherm of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane, as shown in eqs 4 and 5(41,42) 4   5  where KL (L/mg)
and q0 (mg/g) are the Langmuir isothermal
constants of the adsorption rate and the adsorption capacity, respectively.
Parameters KF (L/mg) and n represent the Freundlich isothermal constants. For the Langmuir
model, it was assumed that the adsorption was localized on a monolayer,
and the adsorbent had homogeneous adsorption sites. For the Freundlich
model, it was assumed that the adsorbent had multilayer adsorption
sites on its heterogeneous surface.

Adsorption equilibrium is
a dynamic process; that is, the adsorption equilibrium was reached
when the adsorption rate was equal to the desorption rate. The adsorption
isotherms simulated according to the Langmuir and Freundlich models
are shown in Figure 8a,b. The original MB solution pH was 6.5, and the test temperature
was 298 K. The theoretical value of the adsorption capacity qm calculated by Langmuir is about 165.837 mg/g,
which confirms that the DA@PDA membrane is a good adsorbent toward
MB. Furthermore, the R2 (0.9933) of the
Langmuir model was larger than the R2 (0.0426)
of the Freundlich model. Those results suggested that the Langmuir
model was more suitable for describing the adsorption behavior of
MB by DA@PDA nanofiber membranes. For comparison purposes, Figure 8c gives the adsorption
capacities of different adsorbents for MB.43−51 The maximum adsorption capacities of DA@PDA composite nanofibers
can reach up to 166 mg/g, which is larger than that of most of the
traditional adsorbents, as shown in Figure 8c.

Figure 8 (a) Langmuir and (b) Freundlich isothermal models
of the DA@PDA
nanofiber membrane for adsorbing MB (adsorption conditions: temperature
was 298 K, and pH was 6.5). (c) Comparison of adsorption capacities
of different adsorbents for MB at 298 K.

2.8 Thermodynamic
Study
Figure 9a provides the effect of temperature
on the adsorption capacity of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane. The adsorption
capacity of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane significantly increased
with increasing temperature in the range 288–323 K, which reached
up to 100 mg/g at 323 K. Its corresponding removal rate was 99.8%.
The results suggest that MB adsorption on the adsorbent is favored
at higher temperatures within the appropriate temperature range. This
result can be explained in that the mobility and diffusion of MB molecules
increased with the increase of the temperature, resulting in an increase
in contact with active adsorption sites on the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane.
Moreover, the chemical interaction between the adsorbate and the surface
function of the adsorbent increased with the increase of the temperature.52

Figure 9 (a) Variation of the adsorption amount of MB with increasing
temperature
for the DA@DA nanofiber membrane (adsorption conditions: temperature
was 298 K, pH was 6.5, weight of the adsorbent was 10 mg, and adsorption
time was 24 h). (b) Plot of ln KL versus
1/T to determine the thermodynamic parameters.

To further study the adsorption mechanism of DA@PDA
nanofiber membranes,
the thermodynamic parameters, such as enthalpy change (ΔH0), Gibbs free energy change (ΔG0), and entropy change (ΔS0), were determined by eqs 6 and 7(53) 6   7  where T and R are the system absolute
temperature (K) and the universal constant
(8.314 J/mol·K), respectively. KL (L/mol·K) is the Langmuir equilibrium constant. The KL are 0.0925, 2.046, 0.2998, and 0.4618 L/mol·K
when the temperatures are 288, 298, 308, and 323 K, respectively,
based on eq 4. The ΔH0 and ΔS0 can
be obtained from the intercept and slope of the lines (ln(KL) vs 1/T) in Figure 9b.

From Figure 9b,
it also can be found that the ΔG0 significantly increased as the temperature increased, which indicates
that the high temperature was helpful for the adsorption of MB onto
the surface of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane. All of the ΔG0 values were negative, which means that the
adsorption process was spontaneous. The positive ΔH0 (35.14 kJ/mol) demonstrates that the adsorption process
was a physisorption process and an endothermic process. Furthermore,
the positive ΔS0 (151.14 J/mol·K)
indicates that the randomness of the solid–solution interface
increased when MB was combined with the active sites on the DA@PDA
nanofiber membrane during adsorption. The thermodynamic parameters
indicate that the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane could be used as a viable
and efficient adsorbent for adsorbing MB in an aqueous solution.

In order to further analyze the adsorption mechanism of DA@PDA
composite nanofibers, the FTIR spectra of MB, DA@PDA, and DA@PDA-MB
are shown in Figure 10a. In comparison with DA@PDA composite nanofibers, after adsorbing
MB, the FTIR spectra of DA@PDA-MB changed significantly. The peak
at 3354 cm–1 that was attributed to the stretching
vibration of phenolic O–H and N–H in DA@PDA transformed
into 3327 cm–1 in DA@PDA-MB. The peak at 1630 cm–1 that was attributed to the stretching vibration of
the aromatic ring and bending vibration of N–H in DA@PDA transformed
into 1600 cm–1 in DA@PDA-MB. The peak at 1157 cm–1 that was attributed to the stretching vibration of
C–O in DA@PDA transformed into 1155 cm–1 in
DA@PDA-MB. These results indicated that the phenolic O–H and
N–H played a vital role in the MB adsorption process. Based
on the above-mentioned changes, it can be deduced that the adsorption
mechanism of DA@PDA composite nanofibers for adsorbing MB was attributable
to the following reasons: (1) During the adsorption process, a large
amount of phenolic O–H on the surface of DA@PDA composite nanofibers
was negatively charged; thus, they could be used as effective adsorption
sites for adsorbing cationic dye due to the formation of electrostatic
interactions between the DA@PDA and MB molecules.54 (2) π–π stacking interactions occurred
between the DA@PDA and MB molecules because both DA@PDA and MB contained
abundant aromatic rings, which has been confirmed by the change of
the peak at 1630 cm–1 (aromatic rings).55 Moreover, the DA@PDA composite nanofibers can
be used as a highly efficient adsorbent for MB from an aqueous solution
due to its advantages of nanometer scale, high specific surface area,
high porosity, and good hydrophilicity. Figure 10b provides the schematic illustration of
the adsorption process and adsorption mechanism of DA@PDA composite
nanofibers for adsorbing MB.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a CA nanofiber
membrane was first fabricated by electrospinning,
and then, it was deacetylated to obtain a DA nanofiber membrane. Subsequently,
the DA nanofiber membrane was further modified by a PDA coating layer
to obtain DA@PDA composite nanofibers with a core/shell structure
that was applied as an environmentally friendly and highly efficient
adsorbent for removing cationic MB dye from an aqueous solution. The
results showed that the PDA coating layer was uniformly introduced
onto the surface of DA nanofibers. The DA@PDA composite nanofibers
had an excellent adsorption capacity, and its adsorption capacity
of MB reached up to 88.15 mg/g at a temperature of 298 K and a pH
of 6.5 after adsorption for 30 h, which was about 8.6 times higher
than that of the DA nanofibers. This was because electrostatic and
π–π stacking interactions occurred between the
DA@PDA and MB molecules due to the existence of a large amount of
phenolic O–H and aromatic rings in the PDA coating layers.
The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm, and thermodynamic analysis
indicated that the adsorption behaviors of DA@PDA composite nanofibers
for removing MB conformed to the pseudo-second-order model and the
Langmuir model. Furthermore, adsorption is a spontaneous and physisorption
process. These results suggest that the novel DA@PDA composite nanofibers
possess great potential to be used as an environmentally friendly
and highly efficient adsorbent in wastewater treatment.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Cellulose
diacetate (CA, Mw = 30 kDa) with 39.8
wt % acetyl and 3.5 wt
% hydroxyl was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Technology Co. Ltd. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC, ≥99.5%)
and absolute ethanol (EtOH) were obtained from Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical
Reagent Co. Ltd., China. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥96%) was
purchased from Xiqiao Chemical Co. Ltd, China. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine (dopamine) were obtained from
Shanghai Aladdin Technology Co. Ltd. MB was purchased from Xiqiao
Science and Technology Co. Ltd. All chemical solvents and analytical
regents were used as received.

4.2 Preparation
of CA, DA, and DA@PDA Nanofiber
Membranes
CA powder (3.4 g) was put into a 20 mL acetone/DMAC
(v/v, 2/1) solvent mixture and oscillated for 24 h at 333 K using
a water bath oscillator to obtain a homogeneous 17 wt % CA electrospinning
solution (Figure 11a,b). The CA nanofiber membranes were fabricated by an electrospinning
instrument (Shenzhen Tongli Micro and Nano Technology Co. Ltd, China)
(Figure 11c). During
electrospinning, the needle inner diameter, electrospinning voltage,
collection distance, injection rate, electrospinning time, environmental
temperature, and humidity were 0.52 mm, 18 kV, 15 cm, 1 mL/h, 7 h,
298 K, and 40%, respectively. Before coating with PDA, the CA nanofiber
membrane was first deacetylated by simply immersing it into a 100
mL 0.5 mol/L NaOH solution for 5, 10, and 20 h, which were referred
to as DA-5, DA-10, and DA-20, respectively (Figure 11d). Then, they were taken out and washed
3 times using deionized water and dried in an oven at 60 °C for
5 h (Figure 11e).
Next, the deacetylated DA nanofiber membrane was immersed into a 10
mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH = 8.5) with 2 mg/mL of dopamine and
magnetically stirred at 30 °C for 40 h to form the PDA coating
by dopamine self-polymerization (Figure 11f). The DA@PDA nanofiber membrane was taken
out and carefully washed to remove the residual Tris-HCl solution
for further characterization (Figure 11g). For reference, the CA nanofiber membrane was also
treated by the PDA coating to obtain the CA@PDA nanofiber membrane
by the above-mentioned process.

(f) PDA coating process, and (g) washing and drying process.

4.3 Deacetylation Degree and
Porosity Calculation
A certain weight of the CA membrane
was added to 10 mL of 0.05
M NaOH solution for 5, 10, and 20 h under stirring, respectively.
Then, the redundant alkali was neutralized by using 0.005 M HCl, and
the phenolphthalein was used as the indicator. The deacetylation degree
(DD %) of the DA nanofiber membrane was then calculated according
to eqs 8–1032 8   9   10  where W is the CA membrane
weight, Vb and Cb are the volume and concentration of NaOH solution, and Va and Ca are the
volume and concentration of the HCl solution. The percentage of acetyl
in CA was marked as acetyl (%).

A solvent replacement method
was used to calculate the porosity of CA, DA, CA@PDA, and DA@PDA composite
nanofibers. First, the dried samples were measured and referred to
as W1. Second, the samples were put into
an ethanol bath and adsorbed until the absorption equilibrium was
reached. The weight of the adsorbed sample was measured and is referred
to as W2. The porosity of the samples
can be calculated via eq 11 11  where ρand ρ̅ are the density
of ethanol and DA@PDA fiber membranes, respectively.

4.4 MB Adsorption Experiments
The MB
adsorption capacities of CA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes were
evaluated by batch adsorption experiments. If not explicitly stated
otherwise, the MB adsorption experiments were conducted when the MB
solution, MB concentration, weight of the nanofiber membrane, temperature,
and pH were 20, 50 mg/L, 10 mg, 298 K, and 6.5, respectively. The
thermostatic water bath device was used to adjust the adsorption temperature.
After adsorption, the remaining MB concentration in the supernatant
solution was measured using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan), and a standard curve of MB was drawn at
the maximum wavelength of the MB dye (665 nm). The adsorption capacity
(q) and dye removal efficiency (R) of CA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes were obtained using eqs 12 and 13, respectively, as follows56 12   13  where m is the weight (g)
of the CA, DA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes, and V represents the volume (L) of the MB solution. C0 and Ct are
the concentrations (mg/L) of the MB solution before and after adsorption,
respectively.

In order to study the effect of the MB solution’s
pH on the adsorption capacity, 10 mg of a nanofiber membrane was immersed
in 20 mL of a 50 mg/L MB solution at 298 K, under different original
pH conditions of 2–10. The MB concentration remaining in the
supernatant solution after adsorbing for 24 h was investigated. The
pH of the original MB solution was controlled by adding 0.1 mol/L
NaOH or 0.1 mol/L HCl solution, dropwise. In order to study the adsorption
isotherms, 10 mg of the nanofiber membrane was immersed into 20 mL
of the MB solution at 298 K, at a pH of 6.5, under different original
solution concentrations of 30, 50, and 100 mg/L. The MB solution concentration
remaining in the supernatant solution after adsorbing for 24 h was
investigated. In order to investigate the adsorption thermodynamic,
the adsorption isotherms at different temperatures of 288, 298, 303,
308, 313, and 323 K were also studied. The other experimental parameters
were the same as in the pH experiment.

4.5 Characterization
The morphologies
of CA, DA, CA@PDA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes were observed using
SEM (S-3400N, Hitachi, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.
The SEM images were measured using the Nano Measure software to obtain
the diameter distributions and the average diameters of the CA, DA,
CA@PDA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes. The chemical structures of
the CA, DA, CA@PDA, and DA@PDA nanofiber membranes were characterized
using an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific, USA).
The resolution was 4 cm–1 and the wavenumber range
was 400–4000 cm–1, and each sample was scanned
128 times in total. The WCA in air was measured on a machine (DSA25,
KRUSS, Germany). The specific surface area of the DA@PDA nanofiber
membrane was measured and calculated on an adsorption unit (3Flex
3500 Micrometrics, USA) using the BET method. At the same time, the
graphic data of adsorption and desorption under a nitrogen atmosphere
were obtained. The zeta potential of the DA@PDA surface was investigated
to evaluate the surface zeta potential of the sample, which ranges
from pH = 2 to pH = 10 using a nanometer particle size and a zeta
potential analyzer (NanoPlus3, micromeritics, USA).
