Nitric acid is widely
used for many applications. However, because
of the large number of nitrogen species and the fact that for concentrations
greater than 10–2 mol·L–1, its dissociation is incomplete in an aqueous medium, nitric media
are very complex to describe especially in temperature. Using data
from the literature and some nitrous acid analyses, it was possible
to determine the balance sheet of all different aqueous nitrogen species
for a total nitric acidity ranging from 1.5 to 8.5 mol·L–1 and for temperature ranging from 50 to 95 °C
with the assumption that the use of a refrigerant column makes gaseous
species negligible. For this, it was necessary to determine the ionic,
molecular, and solvent activity coefficients and then solve an eight
equation system with nine unknowns by determining one unknown experimentally.

1 Introduction
Nitric acid has been the
subject of many studies since its industrialization
in the 19th century because of its reactivity with metals (at that
time it was one of the only acids capable of dissolving gold and platinum).
The large number of nitrogen species present at the different degrees
of oxidation makes the chemistry of this acid extremely complex. Nitric
acid, from a concentration greater than 10–2 mol·L–1, behaves as a weak acid, which means that its dissociation
is incomplete in an aqueous medium.1 The
purpose of this publication is to determine the different dissociation
constants of the nitric acid in a range of acidity varying from 1.5
to 8.5 mol·L–1 and in a range of temperature
varying from 50 to 95 °C. The data collected in the scientific
literature show that the higher the acidity and the temperature of
the medium, the less the dissociation is advanced. Davis and De Bruin1 studied for the first time, in 1964, the behavior
of the equilibrium water–acid mixtures varying from 0 to 100%.
These authors had, however, taken into account the presence of only
three species in solution which are HNO3, H+, and NO3–. Later, Nichols and Taylor,2 based on data collected in the scientific literature,
simulated the evolution of the various ionic and molecular activity
coefficients, the osmotic coefficients but also the dissociation of
nitric acid in aqueous medium with the evolution of the acidity and
the temperature of the medium at equilibrium. However, the authors
took into account again only the three major species. More recently,
Sicsic3 presented the evolution of the
concentrations of gaseous and aqueous species according to the total
acidity of the medium at ambient temperature. This author described
the concentration evolution of 14 nitrogen species according to the
acidity of the medium at equilibrium. These results show considerable
differences in comparison with the results of the previous authors
at room temperature. It is therefore not excluded that similar differences
are observed at higher temperatures. To conclude, there are currently
no reliable and valid data on the concentrations of species in solution
as a function of temperature and acidity. This work deals with the
understanding of the nitric medium and more particularly with the
calculation of the concentrations and real activities of the ions
in solution for large ranges of total nitric concentrations and temperatures
from thermodynamic data listed in the literature.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Experimental Setup
The tests are
carried out in a batch of 60 mL containing 15 mL of nitric acid. Solutions
were stirred at 300 rpm and maintained 1 h at each temperature. The
different nitrous concentrations were recorded using UV–visible
spectroscopy. The device used was Varian Cary 50 from Agilent Technologies.
The nitric gases are recombined via a cooling column thermostated
at 6 °C. Thus, only the species in solution were taken into consideration
in the determination of the concentrations of the nitrogen species
of the system.

2.2 Griess Analysis
The concentration
of the nitrous acid HNO2 in solution was determined by
a colorimetric method derived from the Griess method.4 Samplings were first stabilized by dilution in a sodium
hydroxide solution to form NaNO2. Then, the colored compound
(absorption coefficient close to 47 000 at 530 nm) is obtained
by diazotization of the nitrous acid with sulphanilic acid, followed
by coupling with α-naphthylamine. Reactions occur at pH 2.4.
Samples from the solution were immediately diluted in a solution of
sodium hydroxide at 10 mol·L–1. The dilutions
were carried out by weighing. More precisely, to perform this analysis,
several additions to the aliquot of the solution to be characterized
are needed:Concentrated sodium
hydroxide solution (100 μL,
10 mol·L–1) (Merck reference 480648) was added
to an aliquot of the sample to characterize to freeze the nitrous
acid contained into the sample as NaNO2.

Then, 500 μL of a solution of sulfanilic acid
(Sigma-Aldrich reference 251917) at a concentration of 3.4 ×
10–2 mol/kg, solubilized in nitric acid (Sigma-Aldrich
CAS number 7697-37-2) concentrated at 3 mol/kg was added.

Then, 500 μL of a solution composed
of a mixture
of sodium acetate (Merck reference 106267) and chloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich
CAS number 79-11-8), respectively, concentrated at 0.8 and 3.2 mol/kg
was introduced. After 5 min of rest, an addition of 1.5 mL of a solution
composed of α-naphthylamine (Sigma-Aldrich CAS number 134-32-7)
at a concentration of 4.15 × 10–2 mol/kg, solubilized
in nitric acid (3 mol/kg) was proceeded.

Finally, after 10 min of rest, a new addition of the
previous sodium acetate and chloroacetic acid mixture was performed
to complete the volume to 5 mL.



At this
stage, the colored complex was formed and was
ready for the determination of its absorbance using a Varian Cary
50 spectrophotometer from Agilent Technologies. Prior to the determination
of nitrous concentrations of the different samples, a calibration
has to be done using sodium nitride solutions at different known concentrations
as samples, following the same protocol and as shown in Figure 1: the absorbance found at 530
nm by UV–visible spectroscopy is then plotted as a function
of the concentration of nitrous acid in the starting solution. It
appears that the concentration of nitrous acid in the starting solution
is linearly related to the absorbance measured at 530 nm following
a Beer–Lambert law.

Figure 1 Calibration of the determination of the nitrous
acid concentration
by the method of Griess using UV–visible spectrometry done
using sodium nitride solutions of known concentrations.

A 10% error bar has to be applied to experimental
concentration
data. This error was calculated taking into account uncertainties
from the dilution of samples (5%), the weighing (1%), and calibration
precision (8%).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Nitric Acid Properties
In aqueous
solution, nitric acid HNO3 has a strong oxidizing power
and can therefore react with reducing agents, allowing the formation
of new species at lower oxidation degrees. Plieth5 summarized the different gaseous or liquid nitrogen species
that may appear during the reduction of the acid as a function of
their degrees of oxidation. The species included in this study are
identified in Table 1. Many nitrogen species cannot be included in this table because
of either their absence in a concentrated environment or the lack
of information on chemical equilibria and stabilities in aqueous solution
at the temperatures studied. Moreover, in view of the recombination
of the gases by means of a cooling column, only species in aqueous
form will be considered in this study. Chemical equilibria will be
listed in the next section involving the aqueous species listed in
the Table 1. Despite
its presence in solution has been demonstrated by Schmid and Krichel6 in 1964, nitrogen monoxide will not participate
at these equations. More recently in 2010, Binnewies et al.7 explained that nitrous acid cannot be pure in
solution and that it would then form equilibrium with HNO3 and NO.

This article presents concentrations
of the species with molarities
while most of the scientific articles deal with molalities. Conversion
involves the density of the solutions. The density of the nitric acid
solution varies not only with the acidity of the solution but also
with the temperature of the medium. The data are repertoried in international
databases.8

3.2 Chemical
Equilibria of Aqueous Solutions of
Nitric Acid
3.2.1 HNO3 Dissociation
In
the case of concentrations above 10–2 mol·L–1, the dissociation of nitric acid is incomplete according
to equilibrium 3.2.1 3.2.1  

In general, the authors agree that
when temperature and acidity increase, the dissociation of nitric
acid is favored.

Davis and De Bruin1 in 1964 studied
for the first time this equilibrium for all nitric acid concentrations.
These authors had, however, taken into account the presence of only
three species in solution appearing in eq 3.2.1. The equilibrium thermodynamic constant of eq 3.2.1 given by the authors at
25 °C is 15.4 ± 2.1.

More recently, the Sicsic model3 presents
the evolution of the concentrations of gaseous and aqueous species
function of the acidity of the medium. The equilibrium constant 3.2.1 calculated by Sicsic at 25 °C is 19.5. The
author’s model describes the concentration evolution of 14
different nitrogen species (8 gaseous and 6 aqueous) according to
the acidity of the system. In the case of same equilibrium in the
remainder of this article, the values calculated by Sicsic will be
retained because these data are more accurate.

Nichols and Taylor,2 based on data collected
in the scientific literature, simulated the nitric acid dissociation
at equilibrium, considering evolution of the various ionic and molecular
activity coefficients and the osmotic coefficients. In this modeling,
the authors were studying the evolution of nitric acid and temperature
in this modeling. However, the authors took into account the “simple”
system already studied by Davis and De Bruin. This study at 25 °C
is compared with the Sicsic model, and the results are presented in Figure 2. The difference
between the data of the different authors, related to the use of a
simpler system, was calculated on 12 points and can be fitted by a
polynomial function 3.2.2 3.2.2  with y as the difference
and x as the total nitric acid of the system.

Figure 2 Evolution of
the HNO3 dissociation coefficient at ambient
temperature according to the total HNO3 concentration of
the system. Modification of Nichols & Taylor2 values based on Sicsic3 data.

The corrected Nichols and Taylor
dissociation values are virtually
close to those of Sicsic (Figure 2). This deviation, estimated as constant as a function
of temperature in the absence of other thermodynamic data, will be
used for calculations at temperatures higher than 25 °C.

3.2.2 HNO3 Self-Ionization
In the mid-twentieth
century, some authors9,10 observed
that nitric acid solutions were conductive and proposed partial ionization
of the HNO3 molecule via a dehydration process according
to the following equilibrium 3.2.3 3.2.3  

The dinitrogen pentoxide
completely
dissociates11 into NO3– and NO2+ ions, thus modifying the previous
equilibrium as follows 3.2.4 3.2.4  

To conclude, the
nitric acid molecule partially self-ionizes into
NO3– and NO2+ ions.

3.2.3 Formation of Nitrosonium Ion NO+
Nitrous acid predominantly exists in the molecular form
HNO2 in dilute nitric acid solutions. However, when the
acidity of the solution increases, the equilibrium of the reaction 3.2.5 is shifted in favor of nitrosonium NO+ formation 3.2.5  

In 1956, Bayliss
and Watts12 demonstrated the existence
of this ion in an
aqueous medium by observing it by UV spectrophotometry (with an absorption
band at 260 nm) in highly concentrated (sulfuric and perchloric) acids.
At high acidity in these media, the proton activity is high while
the activity of water is low, favoring the formation of NO+.

3.2.4 Absorption of Nitrogen Dioxide NO2
Vetter13 shown in 1949 that
in a closed medium, at four different acidities varying from 20 to
100 °C, the dioxide nitrogen is present in solution, and its
concentration increases with temperature and acidity according to
the following mechanism 3.2.6 3.2.6  

By circulating an electric current
in nitric acid solutions at different concentrations, the author produced
known concentrations of nitric acid according to equilibrium 3.2.7 3.2.7  

Using a platinum electrode, the author registered the half-wave
potential of the HNO2/HNO3 couple, allowing
it to recover to the concentration of nitrous acid in solution. For
the study described, the activity coefficients were kept constant
for all acidities. The coefficients used were those presented by Davis
and De Bruin.1 More recently in 1999, Lehnig14 validates the 3.2.6 equilibrium
between NO3–, NO2, and HNO2 by NMR on the 15N spectrum.

3.2.5 Calculations of the Standard Free Enthalpies
of the Selected Mechanisms
Table 2 lists the different aqueous species retained
for this simulation and the notation used in the rest of this article
to present them in a system of equations. Equivalent standard free
enthalpies are also indicated. The standard enthalpy of NO(aq) does
not have to be determined because this molecule only intervenes in
conservation equations of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

standard free enthalpies of the previous equilibria
are listed in the eqs 3.2.8–3.2.11. 3.2.8   3.2.9   3.2.10   3.2.11  

Shock et al.23,24 studied the evolution of the
equilibrium constant ΔHr01.1 according to the temperature.
After calculation, the authors concluded after calculation to a standard
enthalpy equal to −27 kJ·mol–1. This
difference of 55% with the calculated data is important and corresponds
to the differences of free enthalpies chosen, thus modifying the standard
enthalpy of the equilibrium.

Sicsic also presented the equilibrium 3.2.6 and
the standard enthalpy is similar (difference of 3% between both values).

To correlate the evolution of the equilibrium constants with the
temperature studied, van’t Hoff’s law is used 3.2.12. 3.2.12  

The literature data were used to find at least
one equilibrium
constant value at a precise temperature (shown in bold in Table 3). Once these data
were collected, it was then possible to apply the formula 3.2.12 and complete Table 3.

a The data at 25
°C were found
in scientific literature. Then, the equilibrium constant at the other
temperatures were calculated from eq 3.2.12. References specific to each value are listed next
to the values.

In addition
to the four equilibria mentioned above, it is possible
to add four equations concerning the conservation of the charges,
oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms. All of this leads to a system
of eight equations with nine unknowns. The system is presented by eqs 3.2.13–3.2.20 and cannot be solved as it (more unknowns than equations).
The unknowns are therefore the concentrations X1 to X9.

The terms γ
represent the molecular or ionic activity coefficients.
In the same mixture, the activity coefficients are different for the
ionic species and the molecular species. In a same mixture, all ionic
species of the same charge will have the same activity coefficient.27 The same applies to molecular species. The determinations
of the ionic and molecular activity coefficients in each mixture will
be presented later in this article (see section 3.2.7). Quantification of the solvent activity
coefficient, in this case water, is found from the Nichols and Taylor
data via the osmotic coefficient (directly related to the molecular
activity coefficient of the solvent), this development is carried
out in the section 3.2.8. 3.2.13   3.2.14   3.2.15  with γ6 = γ1 3.2.16  with γ9 = γ8 3.2.17   3.2.18   3.2.19   3.2.20  

To solve
this system of eight equations with nine unknowns, it
is necessary to be able to determine at different acidities and temperatures
the evolution of the concentration of at least one of the species
intervening in the previous mechanisms. This will reduce the number
of unknowns, and it will then be possible to calculate the concentrations
of all nitrogen species in solution. The nitrous acid HNO2 has been chosen because there are many available protocols to determine
its concentration in nitric solution by UV–visible spectroscopy.28

3.2.6 Evolution of Nitrous
Acid Concentration
in Concentrated Nitric Medium
Nitrous acid is the nitrogen
species (excluding HNO3) most studied in the literature.29,30 Its dosage can be carried out from an absorbent titration by the
Griess reagent. In her work, Fournier31 describes a concentration of nitrous acid of about 10–5 mol·L–1 when the total acidity of the medium
is 10 mol·L–1 and the temperature is set at
80 °C.

Similar experiments were carried out, and the Griess
method was also used to determine the concentration of nitrous acid
required for solving the system of equations at the acidities and
temperatures of interest. The results of the UV spectrophotometry
demonstrate that the concentrations of nitrous acid for the same total
acidity (in molarity) were identical whatever the temperature in the
range [50–95 °C]. The results of this study are presented
in Figure 3, and the
graph shows a linear decrease of the nitrous acid concentrations while
the total acidity of the system increases according to the formula 3.2.21 3.2.21  

Figure 3 Linear
evolution of the concentration
of nitrous acid as a function
of the total acidity of the system at all temperatures in the range
[50–95 °C]. Concentrations of nitrous acid were extrapolated
from spectroscopic results by the Griess method.

The values presented are on the same order of magnitude (10–5 mol·L–1) as those of Fournier
study.30

3.2.7 Calculations
of the Ionic and Molecular
Activity Coefficients in HNO3/H2O Mixtures
Some authors assimilate the activities to ionic or molecular concentrations.
This choice, which is appropriate in the case of an ideal solution,
is justified by the very low concentrations of the species studied.
In such a case, the difference between the ionic and molecular activity
coefficients is reduced. For this study in a concentrated nitric medium,
it is necessary to consider the activity coefficients for ionic, molecular,
and water species. Nichols and Taylor2 presented
in their study the modeling of the evolution of the ionic and molecular
activities according to the evolution of the molality and the temperature
of the system. Modeling is based on experimental data collected by
Clegg and Brimblecombe.32 Thus, while the
temperature increases, the activity coefficients decrease and vice
versa (for acidities >1 mol/kg). Table 4 lists the ionic and molecular activity coefficients
according to the acidities and temperatures of interest.

3.2.8 Coefficient of Water Activity in HNO3/H2O Mixtures
In the case of the solvent,
here distilled water, its properties are defined with the osmotic
coefficient. Thus, Nichols and Taylor2 quantified
this coefficient with the evolution of the temperature and the acidity
of the medium. Then, a formula introduced by Butler and James33 in 1998 converts the osmotic coefficient into
water activity 3.2.22 3.2.22  with:aH2O the activity
of water (product of the molecular activity coefficient and the concentration),

ϕ the osmotic coefficient,

ν the number of ions produced during
the dissociation
of a molecule of HNO3 (in this case equivalent to the dissociation
coefficient multiplied by 2),

m the nitric molality,

55.51
the water molality.



Table 5 shows the osmotic coefficients
of water in HNO3/H2O mixtures modeled by Nichols
and Taylor2 and the values of calculated
activity coefficients. There
is a significant variation of the osmotic coefficient depending on
acidity or temperature; the effect on water coefficient values remains
low because the difference between the lowest value and the largest
does not exceed 20%, whatever the acidity or temperature of the medium.

3.2.9 Calculation of Concentrations
of Nitric
Species in Equilibrium Solution
Using the nitrous acid concentrations
previously determined, it is then possible to solve the system of
equations relating to the dissociation of HNO3 3.2.23   3.2.24   3.2.25   3.2.26   3.2.27   3.2.28   3.2.29   3.2.30  

The Scilab software34 was used to solve
this system using an iterative method.
Equilibrium constants or standard enthalpy calculations present uncertainties.
However, because of a lack of information on uncertainties on thermodynamic
data of reaction (equilibrium constants) and compound (standard enthalpies),
unfortunately not always associated with the data found in the literature,
it was impossible to determine uncertainties on our modeled values.
The system of equations presented is therefore not strictly correct.
The use of about 500 iterations allows getting close to the resolution
of the system of equations.

The evolution of the concentrations
of HNO3, NO3–, and H+ according to the variation
of the temperature and the acidity of the nitric solution is presented
in Figure 4. In the
same way as presented in the literature, the more the acidity and
the temperature increase, the more the dissociation of the nitric
acid is partial. The clearest example appears at 95 °C for a
total nitric acidity of 8.5 mol·L–1: one-third
of the nitric acid is not dissociated (i.e., 2.74 mol·L–1). Conversely, in the less aggressive conditions selected, at a concentration
of 1.5 mol·L–1 at 50 °C, the entire nitric
acid molecule seems dissociated.

Figure 4 Evolution of the concentrations modeled
of HNO3, NO3–, and H+ according to the variation
of the acidity of the system at three different temperatures.

Evolutions of concentrations of
the major species HNO3, NO3–, and H+ follow linear
regressions. The equations of the lines as a function of the overall
acidity of the system and the temperature are as follows:For the nondissociated HNO3 molecule 3.2.31

 3.2.31  For
NO3– and H+ ions 3.2.32

 3.2.32  

The precision of the concentrations
presented in this section concerning
the concentrations of minor species is in the order of magnitude (because
of inaccuracies in the determinations of thermodynamic equilibrium
constants or enthalpies of the species present in solution). The following
paragraphs present the effects of temperature and acidity changes
on concentrations of minority nitrogen species (concentration below
to 10–5 mol·L–1) in solution,
by descending order. The logarithmic scale was applied in the following
figures to visualize the evolution of the concentrations at the three
temperatures as a function of the acidity.

3.2.9.1 For
Nitrogen Monoxide NO
It is
the most concentrated minority species. This species is the only one
that does not fit into the equilibria mentioned in the previous sections.
However, it has been considered in the system of equations for the
conservation of nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The results are presented
in Figure 5 and the
resolution of the system of equations at all temperatures and acidities
leads to an independent temperature evolution for nitrogen monoxide
in the same way as it was measured for nitrous acid. Concentrations
decrease linearly while the acidity increases according to eq 3.2.33. The point modeled at
95 °C for the lower acidity is abnormally high, probably resulting
from an error related to the determination of a thermodynamic data
under these operating conditions. 3.2.33  

Figure 5 Evolution
of the concentration modeled of the nitrogen monoxide
in solution according to the variation of temperature and acidity
of the system.

3.2.9.2 For
Nitrous Acid HNO2
The second most concentrated
minority species in solution is nitrous
acid HNO2. The evolution of its concentration, solely dependent
on the acidity of the medium, was mentioned earlier (Figure 3) in this article.

3.2.9.3 For Nitrogen Dioxide NO2
The modeling of
evolution of nitrogen dioxide concentrations is
shown in Figure 6.
Concentrations increase with the total acidity of the system. On the
other hand, an increase in temperature induces a decrease in the concentrations
of nitrogen dioxide in solution. The concentrations modeled for each
temperature lead to lines whose regressions are expressed in eq 3.2.34. 3.2.34  

Figure 6 Evolution of
the concentration modeled of the nitrogen dioxide
in solution according to the variation of temperature and acidity
of the system.

3.2.9.4 For
the Nitronium Ion NO2+
Figure 7 presents the evolution of
the concentration of the NO2+ ion according
to the evolution of the temperature
and the total acidity of the system. The concentration of this ion
increases with the total acidity of the medium. In general, the graph
shows an increase in the concentration of the NO2+ ion in solution when the acidity decreases, as a function of the
temperature according to the laws described by the eq 3.2.35. Under the experimental conditions
at 50 °C for acidity of 7.5 mol·L–1, the
modeled NO2+ concentration appears to be low
compared with the concentrations determined for other nitric acidities
at the same temperature. This difference can only be explained by
an error at this point on the determination of one or more thermodynamic
parameters. The correlation coefficient of the linear regression for
the temperature at 50 °C is expressed without taking into account
the point at 7.5 M. The points at 1.5 M for each temperature were
also not considered for eq 3.2.35 because they are too low. The eq 3.2.35 are therefore valid in the acidity interval
[3–8.5 M]. 3.2.35  

Figure 7 Evolution of
the concentration modeled of the NO2+ ion in
solution according to the variation of temperature
and acidity of the system.

3.2.9.5 For the Nitrosonium Ion NO+
The evolution of the concentration of the NO+ ion is shown in Figure 8. When the temperatures of the medium are equal to 50 and
95 °C, the concentrations obtained increase with the acidity.
The points modeled at these temperatures according to the variation
of the acidity forms lines that are expressed by eq 3.2.36. 3.2.36  

Figure 8 Evolution of the concentration modeled of the
NO+ ion
in solution according to the variation of temperature and acidity
of the system.

For modeling at 75 °C,
the solution concentration of the NO+ ion appears to increase
with the acidity of the medium without
following a linear regime. Concentrations obtained for the extreme
acidity conditions appear to be particularly erroneous because they
differ from several orders of magnitude of those found for intermediate
nitric concentrations. These deviations can be attributed to inaccuracies
in the determinations of certain thermodynamic equilibrium constants.
The lesser error at this scale can have repercussions as observed
here on concentrations below 10–11 mol·L–1. The value retained at 75 °C describing the
concentration of the NO+ ion is therefore 10–14 mol·L–1, four points on the six presented
are modeled at this order of magnitude.

3.2.9.6 Modeling
Balance Sheet
This article
deals with the modeling of the concentrations of the nitric species
in solution at equilibrium in an acid range between 1.5 and 8.5 mol·L–1 as a function of a temperature ranging from 50 to
95 °C. The set of modeled data is summarized in Table 6. All these data are based on
two main assumptions. The first is that the difference between the
Sicsic and Taylor data at 25 °C is applicable to the other temperatures
and the second is that the medium is only aqueous (recombined gases
via a refrigerant column).

On the basis of the
data in Table 6, it
is possible to express at each acidity the impact
of temperature on the concentrations of nitrogenous species in solution.
Because the concentrations of nitrogen monoxide and nitrous acid do
not vary with temperature, the above eqs 3.2.21 and 3.2.33 stay valid.
For the other species with the exception of NO+, the concentration
plot is shown Figure 9. Concentrations appear to change with temperature depending on known
functions.

Figure 9 Modeled concentrations of nitrogen species in solution as a function
of temperature for different acidities.

The temperature-dependent change in the concentration of
NO+ cannot, however, be expressed by a function. This is
due
to the points at 75 °C having a different tendency from the points
obtained at the same acidity at other temperatures.

After quantifying
the functions impacting the concentrations of
nitrogen species according to acidity and temperature, it is possible
to determine a global law, for each species, determining the evolution
of its concentration whatever the acidity or the temperature. These
laws, presented by the eqs 3.2.37–3.2.42, are valid in an acidity
range from 1.5 to 8.5 mol·L–1 and a temperature
range from 50 to 95 °C. For the determination of the correlation
coefficient of NO2+ in eq 3.2.42, the point at 7.5 M 75 °C was not considered,
in the same way as it had not been considered in the eq 3.2.35. 3.2.37   3.2.38   3.2.39   3.2.40   3.2.41   3.2.42  

4 Conclusion
To conclude,
no reliable and valid data on the concentrations of
nitrogen species in solution as a function of temperature and acidity
were available for nitric acid so far. This work deals with the understanding
of the nitric medium and more particularly with the calculation of
the concentrations and real activities of the ions in solution for
large ranges of total nitric concentrations and temperatures from
thermodynamic data listed in the literature. It was first demonstrated
that at equilibrium, the concentration of nitrous acid decreases only
when acidity increases, but the variation of the temperature of the
medium from 50 to 95 °C had no impact on these concentrations.
In addition, after having posed and solved, with the help of the software
Scilab, a system of 8 equations with 8 unknowns, it was possible to
determine the concentrations of aqueous species at equilibrium. The
study of the evolution of concentrations according to the variations
of temperature and acidity led to the development of a model, for
a majority of these species, which determine the concentration of
each species regardless of temperature or acidity over the temperature
range [50–95 °C] and the acidity range [1.5–8.5
M].
