Optical properties can be programmed on mesoscopic scales
by patterning
host materials while ordering their nanoparticle inclusions. While
liquid crystals are often used to define the ordering of nanoparticles
dispersed within them, this approach is typically limited to liquid
crystals confined in classic geometries. In this work, the orientational
order that liquid crystalline colloidal hosts impose on anisotropic
nanoparticle inclusions is combined with an additive manufacturing
method that enables engineered, macroscopic three-dimensional (3D)
patterns of co-aligned gold nanorods and cellulose nanocrystals. These
gels exhibit polarization-dependent plasmonic properties that emerge
from the unique interaction between the host medium’s anisotropic
optical properties defined by orientationally ordered cellulose nanocrystals,
from the liquid crystal’s gold nanorod inclusions, and from
the complexity of spatial patterns accessed with 3D printing. The
gels’ optical properties that are defined by the interplay
of these effects are tuned by controlling the gels’ order,
which is tuned by adjusting the gels’ cellulose nanocrystal
concentrations. Lithe optical responsiveness of these composite gels
to polarized radiation may enable unique technological applications
like polarization-sensitive optical elements.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Additive manufacturing’s
deft ability to locally tune material
composition and structure has made it the focus of scientific studies
to realize novel materials with previously inaccessible properties.1 Examples include the three-dimensional (3D) printing
of buildings,2 alloyed objects,3 photovoltaics and other electronics,4,5 metamaterials,6 gels,7 microparticles and nanomaterials,8,9 optical
elements,10,11 stimuli-responsive actuators and sensors,12 and even food.13 Although
many innovative materials can be 3D printed, eliciting useful metamaterial
properties through synergistic interactions of functional nanomaterial
inclusions with their host remains a challenge. Both liquid-crystal
(LC) and LC polymeric hosts with orientationally aligned plasmonic
nanoinclusions, including LC elastomers, have been used to address
this challenge. Prepared by fiber drawing,14 reorienting stress,15 and other methods,16 control over a metamaterial’s optical
response in bulk or interfacial domains has been achieved. Additionally,
hydrogels with isotropic or unaligned inclusions including plasmonic
nanoparticles also have been characterized for diverse applications.17 Separately, extrusion-type direct-ink-writing
(DIW) 3D printing methods have imparted orientational order to LCs
in stimuli-responsive four-dimensional gels to enable “biomimetic”
attributes.18,19 However, both alignment of LCs
with embedded anisotropic plasmonic nanoparticles and patterning of
orientational order through 3D printing have not been explored to
date.

Capitalizing on the exquisite manufacturing control afforded
by
3D printing methods, we report a new breed of gel-like composite materials
with LC order and plasmonic properties endowed by synergistic guest–host
colloidal interactions. We use LC colloidal hosts to orientationally
order anisotropic nanoparticle inclusions to achieve gels with 3D
patterns of co-aligned gold nanorods (GNRs) and cellulose nanocrystals
(CNCs). While controlling the gels’ orientational order, we
study the interplay of the GNRs’ polarization-dependent plasmonic
properties with the optical and mechanical anisotropies of the host
medium to characterize the composite gels’ optical properties.
We demonstrate a suite of novel gels, which include hydrogels and
aerogels, for applications that require optical control in spatially
programmable, ultralight, and robust gels.

2 Methods
2.1 Metamaterial-Enabling Gel Constituents
Because mechanically robust gels and films with, for example, high
optical transmission coefficients and low scattering can be made from
cellulose20−22 and because well-characterized cellulosic gel chemistries
exist in the literature,23−26 we have chosen to make strong and translucent gels
using lyotropic CNCs, which are synthesized via a sulfuric acid-hydrolysis
method.27 The partial replacement of primary
alcohols with negatively charged sulfate ester moieties forms a stable
aqueous CNC colloidal dispersion with intrinsic molecular charge and
electrostatic charge-screened interactions in acidic and basic conditions.
Moreover, the average measured length of the CNCs (∼300 nm, Figure 1a) is approximately
equivalent to their average persistence length, which is a function
of their average diameter (∼50 nm, Figure 1a) and crystalline cellulose fraction and
distribution.28 Because of the CNCs’
stiffness and ability to form stable colloidal dispersions, monodomain
alignment of lyotropic CNC dispersions can be achieved with relatively
weak extrusion stresses, as we show in this work.

microscopy (TEM) micrograph demonstrating
CNCs’ anisotropy, which enables guest–host alignment
in a gel. (b) Spectral characterization of GNR inclusions with transverse
(∼530 nm) and longitudinal (∼630 nm) surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) extinction peaks. An aqueous dispersion of GNRs as
viewed with the background white light is shown in the inset (c).
(d) A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph of the top surface
of a gel with the GNRs’ longitudinal axis aligned with the
local in-plane director N(r), as shown. Guest GNRs (white
rods) are aligned by host CNCs (dark background) and constrained within
the same gel. The gel with GNRs viewed in the plane of their transverse
axes, as indicated by N(r), is shown in the micrograph
(e). The imaged ends of the GNRs (white dots) are indicated by the
white arrows. The inset (f) shows a TEM micrograph of GNRs drop-cast
on a substrate.

CNCs can provide orientational ordering to composite
gels. Even
if no chemical reaction occurs with the CNCs’ surface functional
groups, the CNCs can become mechanically constrained about their sol-phase
ordering directions within the gel matrix. Additionally, spectral
characterization of GNRs dispersed in deionized water reveals their
anisotropy characterized by a transverse surface plasmon resonance
(TSPR) extinction peak at ∼530 nm and a longitudinal surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) extinction peak at ∼630 nm. The extinction
spectrum is shown in Figure 1b, while the GNRs dispersed in water are shown with white
background illumination in Figure 1c. As shown in Figure 1d, the GNRs’ rodlike shape allows them to be
aligned with the local in-plane director N(r) defined
by the CNC alignment. Co-alignment of their longitudinal axes occurs
via steric interactions within LC media such as lyotropic CNCs. Secondary-electron
detection reveals a stronger signal from the GNRs than from the background
CNCs, due to a larger cross-section of secondary-electron generation
for the gold. The GNRs appear as white rods surrounded by a dark background
in the SEM micrographs of Figure 1d. Meanwhile, a perspective orthogonal to the plane
of Figure 1d is shown
in Figure 1e. Therein,
as indicated by N(r), the plane defined by the GNRs’
transverse axes is demonstrated by the ends of the rodlike GNRs. These
hemispherical-like ends are indicated by the white arrows and appear
as white dots. Both transverse and longitudinal profiles of the GNRs
are shown in inset 1(f), which was captured using TEM. The GNRs appear
dark, while the Formvar background appears bright because of the differences
between the GNRs’ and CNCs’ electron transmission (see
the Supporting Information for preparation
and measurement details). The GNRs’ anisotropy demonstrated
in inset Figure 1f
is also visible with alignment shown by Figure 1 d,e, demonstrating that the GNRs are aligned
along the local director field N(r) that is defined by
the colloidal CNCs in the composite gel. The GNRs’ alignment
and mechanical constraint enable the polarization-dependent excitement
of each GNR’s two distinct plasmonic extinction modes within
the bulk host medium.29−32

2.2 Manufacturing Procedures
We realize
metamaterial gels whose polarization-dependent optical extinction
is enabled by the orientational alignment of anisotropic GNRs by CNCs.
Steric interactions among CNCs and GNRs minimize each particle’s
excluded volume and maximize the total system entropy through orientational
alignment that can be understood by extending the theoretical framework
developed by Onsager.33 Although Liu et
al.31 employed a static process to co-align
GNRs and CNCs throughout a macroscopic sample specimen, we use a kinetic
extrusion process, direct-ink writing (DIW) 3D printing, to spatially
align the GNRs’ longitudinal axis with the flow of extruded
CNCs. We use the critical concentrations found by Liu et al. as references
for our kinetic experimental paradigm to form liquid crystals of CNCs
and align GNRs. We also adopt our colloidal system to the two different
experimental procedures described below.

2.2.1 Procedure 1
Cross-linked poly(acrylamide)
(PAM) has been chosen as our gels’ polymer matrix to host CNCs
and GNRs. PAM-CNC-GNR hydrogels are prepared by photoinitiated radical
polymerization. The chemical structures of the acrylamide (AAm) monomers,
photoinitiator 1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propane-1-one
(Irgacure-2959), base catalyst N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethane-1,2-diamine
(TEMED), and cross-linker N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide)
(MBAA) are presented in Figure 2a. Aqueous colloidal dispersions of CNCs and GNRs were mixed
with AAm, Irgacure-2959, TEMED, and MBAA before printing. The resultant
sol was printed with a commercially available fused-filament-fabrication
3D printer that was retrofitted into a DIW printer. The extrusion
printing process and alignment of CNCs with weak extrusion stresses
are shown schematically in Figure 2b. Therein, the direction of the flow with respect
to the printing substrate is determined by the ink nozzle’s
translational velocity parallel to the substrate. After printing,
Procedure 1’s chemistry grants the formulator enhanced control
over the hydrogel’s degree of cross-linking and elasticity
by means of timed exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. A schematic
of post-printing UV-gelation is presented in Figure 2c. The chemical structure of the final hydrogel,
with cross-linking both within and between gel filaments, is shown
schematically in Figure 2d.

along the flow of the gel precursor by a DIW 3D printing process.
(c) Gelation of the printed sol with UV light. (d) PAM chains are
cross-linked at points along each polymer’s length.

2.2.2 Procedure 2
Manufacturing of a
hydrogel with Procedure 1 is tenable because the concentration of
used CNCs (21–22 wt %) yields a suitably viscous sol that maintains
an object’s shape and director alignment during and after printing
and before cross-linking. However, when printing with CNC concentrations
less than ∼20 wt %, low viscosities diminish both an object’s
well-defined orientational ordering and its geometric stability as
its profile slowly collapses and flows under surface-tension and gravitational
forces. Procedure 2 addresses these concerns by tuning the viscosity
to an appropriate range (10–20 Pa s) before cross-linking so
that precursors with CNC concentrations less than 20 wt % can be easily
printed. While Procedure 1 limits GNRs and CNCs to co-axial alignment,
Procedure 2 enables the tuning of guest–host alignment. As
CNC concentrations increase up to 20 wt %, the following alignment
regimes in hydrogels become practicable: (1) isotropic CNC and GNR
organization, (2) nematic CNC and isotropic GNR organization, and
(3) nematic CNC and GNR organization. We found that a gel precursor
with a final CNC concentration of 0.76 wt % yielded a gel with the
properties of (1) and, after evaporation over tens of minutes, the
properties of (2). Condition (3) was realized at ∼10 wt % CNCs,
though the critical concentration differentiating (2) and (3) has
not been determined (see the Supporting Information for optical characterization of these regimes).

To implement
Procedure 2, the precursor is oligomerized before printing. Aqueous
colloidal dispersions of CNCs and GNRs were mixed with AAm, Irgacure-2959,
and TEMED and then were exposed to UV radiation to tune the sol’s
viscosity. The viscous sol with added cross-linker MBAA was printed,
as depicted in Figure 2b. Subsequent cross-linking of PAM oligomers within the printed object
occurred with UV exposure, as illustrated in Figure 2c. Because polymer chains with terminal,
radical moieties exist before cross-linking occurs and persist thereafter
for extended durations,34−38 only the ends of PAM chains are cross-linked whereby still longer
chains are formed. The final cross-linked hydrogel is illustrated
in Figure 2d.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Selective Optical Extinction in Patterned
Hydrogels
Color modulation is apparent to the naked eye upon
exposure of PAM-CNC-GNR gels to white, linearly polarized light. Although
the blueish appearance originating from the LSPR is excited by polarized
light with polarization P that is parallel to the LC
director N in Figure 3a, the TSPR’s reddish appearance is excited
when uniform N is rotated orthogonal to P, as demonstrated by Figure 3b. In addition to hydrogels with average, uniform director N, hydrogels with a continuously changing director in a single-layer
object have been printed, as shown in Figure 3c. Therein, the LSPR and TSPR are observed
by the blueish and reddish colors at positions where N(r) ∥ P and N(r) ⊥ P, respectively, where r represents the two-dimensional
spatial coordinates in the plane of the flat sample. The hydrogels
in Figure 3d,e also
demonstrate consistent geometric profiles though they are made with
lower CNC concentrations than those in Figure 3a–c. All single-layer hydrogels have
an equivalent concentration of GNRs; however, the optical density
of GNRs is decreased in Figure 3d,e because of thinner gel layers than those layers shown
in Figure 3a–c.
Additionally, while the hydrogel in Figure 3d is isotropic, Figure 3e’s hydrogel possesses guest–host
alignment, as indicated by N. For those cases with guest–host
alignment in single-layer hydrogels, to demonstrate that the longitudinal
axes of the GNRs are aligned with the printing direction as described
by the director N, Figure 3f plots the LSPR and TSPR extinction peaks as a function
of the angle θ between the incident polarization P and the director N. Both LSPR and TSPR extinction data
exhibit cos2 θ extinction behavior, as demonstrated
by the LSPR’s solid red and TSPR’s dashed green best-fit
curves. At 0°, N ∥ P such that
the LSPR extinction peak predominates. Meanwhile, at ± 90°, N ⊥ P such that the TSPR extinction peak
predominates. To understand the degree of the GNRs’ alignment
with N, the scalar order parameters for GNR inclusions
in hydrogels manufactured with procedure 1 and 2 were measured as S1 = 0.45 ± 0.13 and S2 = 0.34 ± 0.07, respectively, while the maximum dichroic
ratios were found to be R1 = 3.2 ±
1.2 and R2 = 2.6 ± 0.46, respectively.
Normalized extinction coefficients were estimated to be ∼2.8
OD mm–1 at the TSPR peak and ∼3.4 OD mm–1 at the LSPR peak (see the Supporting Information for measurement and calculation procedures).

Analysis of GNR alignment with average N in a single-layer
disc prepared according to Procedure 2. The LSPR extinction peak predominates
when N ∥ P (0°), while the TSPR
extinction peak predominates when N ⊥ P (±90°). Both extinction-peak maxima demonstrate that the
GNRs’ longitudinal axes are aligned with the printing direction
and N. (g) The birefringent disc from (a) and (b) under
polarizing optical microscopy (POM) with N ∥ P results in a minimum transmitted intensity, where the transmission
axes of the polarizer P and analyzer A are
as shown. (h) With N rotated 45° from either P or A, the birefringent disc exhibits peak transmitted
intensity of the incident white light. (i) With N ∥ A under POM, an intensity minimum occurs again. The POM micrographs
in (g)–(i) indicate that average director N is
parallel with the printing direction, which can be seen as the striping
in each image. POM analysis provides wavelength-independent evidence
of the CNCs’ N alignment with the direction of
printing. (j) A two-layer hydrogel micrograph captured with brightfield
microscopy. The horizontal stripes represent the top layer that rests
on the bottom layer, which is printed vertically. (k) The sample in
(j) under POM and a full-wave retardation plate with slow-axis γ
at 530 nm. Bottom (blue-appearing) and top (yellow-appearing) layers
have a uniform intralayer N with orthogonal interlayer
alignment. For a layer exhibiting a blue color, N ∥
γ, while for a layer exhibiting a yellow color, N ⊥ γ. (l) The sample in (k) with reversed color schemes
demonstrating an in-plane rotation of 90°.

The average CNC director N alignment,
which is analyzed
independently from the average GNR alignment within a hydrogel, can
be understood qualitatively with polarizing optical microscopy (POM)
micrographs, as shown in Figure 3g–i. Intensity minima are observed whenever N ∥ P or N ∥ A, where A and P are the analyzer’s
and polarizer’s transmission axes, as shown in Figure 3g,i, respectively. Additionally,
an intensity maximum is achieved when the sample is at a 45°
displacement from either P or A. The multiplicity
of colors shown in Figure 3h is a result of the material’s varying thickness but
homogeneous composition in the plane orthogonal to N or
slight director relaxation after extrusion but before cross-linking.
The observed POM intensity minima and maximum suggest that, for single-layer
hydrogels with a sufficiently large CNC concentration, PAM-CNC-GNR
hydrogels have a CNC director that is, on average, parallel to the
printing direction within the plane of the flat hydrogel. Moreover,
in this case, the alignment of GNRs with CNCs demonstrates that the
existence of GNR alignment and of GNR-polarization-sensitive optical
properties may be understood generally by the co-existing CNC alignment.

Multilayer hydrogels, like the two-layer lattice shown with brightfield
microscopy in Figure 3j, also have been characterized. Either Procedure 1 or 2 can be used
to generate multilayer structures with the additional step of partial
cross-linking of each layer after completion and before writing the
next, upper layer. For the two-layer hydrogel in Figure 3j, prior to the addition of
the top layer, the bottom layer was partially cross-linked by exposure
to UV light (2 mW/cm2 at 275 nm) for 2 min. The extra UV-exposure
step ensures that intralayer CNC-GNR alignment and optical properties
are preserved within the multilayer gel while enabling the second
layer to be cross-linked to the first in the final UV-exposure step.
Uniform intralayer CNC director alignment is demonstrated in Figure 3k,l, using a full-wave
plate with 530 nm retardation along the slow-axis γ. For Figure 3k,l, the blue-appearing
color indicates parallel alignment of a layer’s average director N with γ. Conversely, the yellow-appearing color indicates
that a layer’s N is aligned orthogonal to γ.
In Figure 3k, the director
is rotated by 90° from the first (blue) to the second (yellow)
layer. Meanwhile, Figure 3l displays the same sample as in Figure 3k but rotated in-plane by 90°. After
this rotation, the first layer now appears yellow while the second
appears blue. Through the consistency of each layer’s coloration, Figure 3k,l reveals that
each intralayer director is preserved on average despite the presence
of an additional layer above or below the other layer.

The samples
in Figure 3a–c,g–i
are printed with Procedure 1. Those
in Figure 3d,e,j–l
are printed with Procedure 2 using 9.4 wt % CNCs with 10.2 wt % AAm
(Figure 3e), 0.76 wt
% CNCs (Figure 3d),
and 10 wt % CNCs (Figure 3j–l). Figure 3f was generated with data from a single-layer disc prepared
with Procedure 2 (9.4 wt % CNCs with 10.2 wt % AAm). All single-layer
gels have an equivalent GNR concentration. All printed samples have
an individual layer thickness of ∼0.35 mm.

3.2 Hydrogel-to-Aerogel Solvent Exchange and Optical
Comparison
The PAM-CNC-GNR gels’ solvent does not
need to be water; though hydrogels are a convenient embodiment of
the aligned PAM-CNC-GNR gel system, gels with nonaqueous solvents
present further opportunities to control light.

By adjusting
the solvent’s refractive index, the plasmonic extinction peaks
can be shifted because of a different refractive index contrast between
the surface of the GNRs and their surrounding media.39 Spectral analysis of a gel’s extinction peaks before
and after conversion from a hydrogel to an aerogel is shown in Figure 4a. The extinction
peaks’ blueshift, especially of the LSPR mode, may be qualitatively
observed by comparison between the hydrogel’s and aerogel’s
colors in Figure 4b,c,
respectively, which portray the corner of one gel in the shape of
CU, whose full extent is visible in Figure 4d,e.

polarization P from a hydrogel and its subsequent aerogel.
(b) A subsection of the CU-shaped plasmonic hydrogel exhibiting the
reddish and bluish appearing TSPR and LSPR absorption modes, respectively.
(c) The same section is shown in (b) after the hydrogel becomes an
aerogel. (d) The entire CU-shaped hydrogel whose subsection in (b)
is indicated by the dashed rectangle. (e) The entire CU-shaped aerogel.
(f) The printed hydrogel’s guest–host alignment is represented
by the black curves with director field N(r). (g) An
alcogel with ethanol. (h) An aerogel with preserved structure and N(r) formed by supercritical carbon dioxide drying.

The procedure to form aerogels from hydrogels is
presented schematically
in Figure 4f–h,
wherein the printed hydrogel (Figure 4f) is immersed in an absolute ethanol bath to yield
an alcogel (Figure 4g). Direct evaporation of a liquid solvent under ambient conditions
can collapse a gel’s network because of surface-tension forces
from the retreating liquid during evaporation. Because ethanol is
miscible with liquid carbon dioxide while water is not, the water-to-ethanol
solvent exchange functions as an intermediate step for supercritically
dried aerogels. Supercritical carbon dioxide can transition seamlessly
to a gaseous state without a discrete phase transition; thus, in the
absence of surface tension, its conversion into a gas does not collapse
or otherwise damage the gel’s solid network.40 The resultant aerogel (Figure 4h) maintains the solid network’s structural
alignment and optical anisotropy present in both its hydrogel and
alcogel states.

4 Conclusions
We have developed a plasmonic
metamaterial whose guest–host
optical interactions cause polarization-dependent extinction of incident
light. Capitalizing on 3D printing, we have programmed spatially complex
optical extinction behavior across the lateral extent of each printed
layer. Moreover, we have shown that the direct-ink-writing 3D printing
method enables macroscopic physical scaling in the gel’s lateral
spatial extent and of the number of layers. Selective alignment and
layering permit the formulator to tune the optical properties of the
gel. By converting the printed hydrogel into an aerogel, the plasmonic
resonances blueshift while the aerogel’s selective extinction
of polarized radiation suggests polarization-sensitive and ultralight
materials’ applications.41 Our work
propounds the usage of these composite gels as hosts for upconverting
plasmonic nanoparticles, nanoantennas, or both. Mechanically and electrically
coupled via elastic assembly, such novel guest particles could enhance
both optical absorption by intrinsic plasmonic resonances and the
resultant fluorescence of higher-energy photonic signals.42 We hypothesize that an additional possibility
to extend this work would be to actuate the gels photomechanically
by inclusion of azobenzene-surface-functionalized plasmonic nanoparticles
within the gel’s network.43−45 Finally, this guest–host
LC gel architecture may be suitable as a template for high-efficiency
advanced electronics, such as pn-junctions in photovoltaics, wherein
aberrant excitonic carrier depletion is decreased by increasing electrode
and recombination area and proximity.46
