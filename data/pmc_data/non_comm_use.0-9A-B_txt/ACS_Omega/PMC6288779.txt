The
isolation of nanocellulose from lignocellulosic biomass, with
desirable surface chemistry and morphology, has gained extensive scientific
attention for various applications including polymer nanocomposite
reinforcement. Additionally, environmental and economic concerns have
driven researchers to explore viable alternatives to current isolation
approaches, employing chemicals with reduced environmental impact.
To address these issues, in this study, we have tuned the amphiphilic
behavior of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) by employing controlled alkali
treatment, instead of in combination with expensive, environmentally
unsustainable conventional approaches. Microscopic and spectroscopic
analysis demonstrated that this approach is capable of tuning composition
and interfacial tension of CNFs through a careful control of the quantity
of residual lignin and hemicellulose. To elucidate the performance
of CNF as an efficient reinforcing nanofiller in hydrophobic polymer
matrices, prevulcanized natural rubber (NR) latex was employed as
a suitable host polymer. CNF/NR nanocomposites with different CNF
loading levels (0.1–1 wt % CNF) were prepared by a casting
method. It was found that the incorporation of 0.1 wt % CNF treated
with a 0.5 w/v % sodium hydroxide solution led to the highest latex
reinforcement efficiency, with an enhancement in tensile stress and
toughness of 16% to 42 MPa and 9% to 197 MJ m–3,
respectively. This property profile offers a potential application
for the high-performance medical devices such as condoms and gloves.

Introduction
Cellulose, as the main
component of lignocellulosic biomass (e.g.,
wood, grass, and agricultural residue), has gained wide attention
for its advantageous attributes, which include its abundance, biodegradability,
low cost, and sustainability. Therefore, it has increasingly been
used in advanced applications such as biomedicine, energy storage,
cosmetics, and nanocomposites.1−5 However, isolation of nanocellulose with desirable morphology and
structure, such as cellulose nanocrystals or cellulose nanofibers
(CNFs), along with practical surface chemistry typically entails chemical
pretreatments and/or further chemical modifications, which can be
expensive and cause several environmental issues.6−9 Therefore, efficient and environmentally
friendly CNF production processes that are associated with a reduction
in total mechanical energy, water, and chemical consumption, together
with the isolation of consistently high aspect ratio CNF, are needed
in order to produce more cost-effective and sustainable nanocellulose
materials.

Lignocellulosic biomass consists mainly of cellulose,
along with
lignin, hemicellulose, and extractives (resins, wax, fatty acids,
etc.), with these components tightly interwoven within the cell wall.
Residual lignin and hemicellulose, as more hydrophobic materials compared
to cellulose, could decrease the polarity of the nanocellulose system
and confer interesting properties to enhance the performance of nanocellulose
material (especially for large-scale production and dispersion in
hydrophobic matrices).2,10−12 However, most
conventional lignocellulose treatments produce predominantly hemicellulose
and lignin-free fibers, leading to stiffer and more hydrophilic CNF
(see the Supporting Information). Therefore,
treatment of lignocellulose biomass with sodium hydroxide, which is
industrially known as the delignification process, not only enables
tuning of the residual hemicellulose and lignin content within the
nanocellulose composition but also increases fiber swelling, making
the fibrillation process simpler, cheaper, less energy-intensive,
and more environmentally sustainable.2,8 However, although
sodium hydroxide is commonly used as a pretreatment process for biomass,
only a few studies exclusively employed alkali treatment to process
lignocellulosic biomass13−16 and rarely prepared CNF.8,17 On
the basis of our knowledge, there is no study on the influence of
controlled alkali treatment performed at such a low concentration
(lower than 2 w/v % NaOH) on the physical, chemical, and thermal properties
of the fibrillated CNF.

We have already demonstrated the effect
of nanofiber surface chemistry
on the reinforcement efficiency of the natural rubber (NR) latex,
concluding that interfacial adhesion between CNF and NR can be enhanced
by adjusting the surface chemistry of CNF.18 The aim of this study is to illuminate the influence of controlled
alkali treatments, ranging from very mild to aggressive, on the composition
of spinifex grass (rarely addressed before) and subsequently investigate
the characteristics and performance of the spinifex-derived CNF series
as reinforcement nanofillers in the NR latex (to demonstrate the practicality
of alkali treatment to prepare CNF for various applications). The
results from this systematic evaluation successfully demonstrated
that using different concentrations of sodium hydroxide during the
treatment is an effective approach to engineer and tune the composition
and surface chemistry of isolated CNF. Therefore, this method showed
potential to be used as an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective
approach for CNF production from lignocellulosic biomass with a desirable
surface chemistry (from hydrophobic to hydrophilic surface tension),
instead of using conventional, more aggressive, and toxic oxidizing
agents for pulping.

Results and Discussion
CNF with Different Compositions
and Morphologies
The
biochemical composition (glucan, hemicellulose including, xylan, arabinan,
mannan, both Klason lignin and acid-soluble lignin, ash, and extractives)
of water-washed Triodia pungens and
treated T. pungens is shown in Figure 1 [Table S1 lists detailed biochemical composition (glucan, xylan,
arabinan, mannan, Klason lignin- and acid-soluble lignin, ash, and
extractives)]. The fraction of total sugar was increased when using
a higher concentration of sodium hydroxide during the alkali treatment.
The ratio of α-cellulose increased from 35.8 to 68.4% for water-washed T. pungens and 14 w/v % NaOH-treated grass, respectively.
This result confirmed that the application of an aggressive alkali
treatment alone is capable of producing a comparable cellulose-rich
product from spinifex biomass.

Figure 1 Relative biochemical composition (cellulose,
lignin, hemicellulose,
ash, and extractives) of water-washed and alkali-treated T. pungens with different concentrations of sodium
hydroxide.

The content of hemicellulose decreased
by increasing the concentration
of sodium hydroxide from 0.5 w/v % NaOH (28.1% hemicellulose) to 14
w/v % NaOH (10.9% hemicellulose). The fraction of lignin also decreased
when it was treated with 0.5 w/v % NaOH (up to 7 w/v % NaOH solution);
this occurs through cleavage reactions where hydroxide anions (OH–) break α-aryl ether and β-aryl ether linkages,
splitting lignin macromolecules into small fragments that can be dissolved
in the aqueous alkali media.19 On the other
hand, the high alkali concentration was capable of producing water-soluble
ingredients by hydrolyzing the hemicellulose components and partially
decomposing the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds.20,21 The content of Klason lignin increased to 13.6% when grass was treated
with a 14 w/v % NaOH solution, which could be associated with the
condensation of lignin or formation of lignin–carbohydrate
complexes on the surface of remaining polysaccharides during the alkali
treatment.22,23 In addition, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of samples in Figure S2 illustrate that by increasing the sodium hydroxide concentration,
cell wall, xylem vessel, lignin, extractives, and ash were further
removed from the cell structure. Therefore, thick and interwoven structures
transformed into a loose lignocellulosic matrix, ready to be further
nanofibrillated with the assistance of high-pressure homogenization
(HPH).

The diameter distribution and structure of the CNF samples
were
characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 2a–e). These
observations confirm the success of CNF refinement, even with very
mild alkali treatment (only 0.5 w/v %), whereas the yield of CNF from
water-washed T. pungens was not practical.
The average diameters of 0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 1 w/v % NaOH–CNF,
2 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 7 w/v % NaOH–CNF, and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF
were 26 ± 13, 19 ± 14, 14 ± 9, 26 ± 13, 17 ±
8, and 19 ± 12 nm, respectively. The average CNF diameter decreased
by increasing the concentration of sodium hydroxide from 0.5 to 2
w/v % because of the decrease in lignin content from 20.8% (in 0.5
w/v % NaOH) to 12.7% (in 2 w/v % NaOH) and cleavage on the cell surface
as observed in SEM images (Figure S1).
However, using a higher sodium hydroxide concentration in alkali treatment
(7 and 14 w/v %) led to increase the level of CNF agglomeration. This
is due to the further removal of hemicellulose and lignin components,
increasing the content of α-cellulose, which raises the density
of hydroxyl groups on the CNF surface and increased affinity of CNF
interaction.

(b)
1 w/v % NaOH–CNF, (c) 2 w/v % NaOH–CNF, (d) 7 w/v %
NaOH–CNF, and (e) 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF (the scale bar is
2 μm).

X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis was conducted to interpret the
changes in structural and crystalline features of CNF samples with
different concentrations of sodium hydroxide treatment. Figure 3a,b shows diffractograms of
extracted CNF and full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the cellulosic
crystalline peak at approximately 22°, respectively. The semicrystalline
XRD patterns displayed a combination of crystalline peaks with a broad
amorphous hump. Well-defined crystalline cellulose I peaks can be
seen at 2θ = 15.2°, 16.2°, 22.3°, and 34.5°,
which correspond to (101), (101̅), (200), and (004) planes,
respectively.24,25 Increasing the sodium hydroxide
concentration from 7 to 14 w/v % resulted in decreasing the intensity
of the (101̅) plane, clarifying that alkali treatment has an
impact on crystalline cellulose orientation.26 On the other hand, the amorphous phase (disordered region) is approximately
at 2θ = 18.5°. As expected, the intensity of the amorphous
phase decreased upon increasing the sodium hydroxide concentration
and removal of amorphous hemicellulose and lignin, as shown in Figure 1.26,27

Figure 3 (a)
XRD curves and (b) FWHM of (200) of water-washed and treated T. pungens samples (0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 1
w/v % NaOH–CNF, 2 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 7 w/v % NaOH–CNF,
and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF).

Figure 3b
illustrates
how FWHM of the cellulose crystalline peaks decreased with increasing
concentration of sodium hydroxide during the alkali treatment. On
the basis of the Debye–Scherrer equation, the mean size of
the ordered (crystalline) region has an inverse relationship with
the FWHM.17,28 Therefore, the crystalline cellulosic domain
increased upon treatment with a higher sodium hydroxide concentration.
In other words, concentrated sodium hydroxide could effectively remove
the noncellulosic amorphous polysaccharides.24,26

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of water-washed
and treated samples showed clear changes in the lignocellulosic chemical
composition after the alkali treatments (see Figure S2 and Table S2). The relative intensities
of absorption bands at 833 cm–1 (bending aromatic
C–H out of plane deformation), 1237 cm–1 (aromatic
ring breathing of C–O and stretching of C–O in syringyl
or guaicyl ring), and 1730 cm–1 (stretching of C=O,
ester-link acetyl, p-coumaroyl, and feruloyl groups
between lignin and hemicellulose) decreased.29,30 In addition, the band at 2846 cm–1 assigned to
C–H symmetrical stretching,31 and
band at 2920 cm–1 associated with the symmetric
C–H stretching absorption bond in aromatic methoxyl, methyl,
and methylene groups32 or C–H2 asymmetric stretching,33 became
less intense with increasing the sodium hydroxide concentration. The
disappearance of these peaks by increasing the concentration of sodium
hydroxide indicated the removal of hemicellulose and lignin components
from T. pungens samples, which is in
agreement with the sugar analysis results.34

Figure 4 shows
the
one-dimensional cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) 13C NMR spectra of the water-washed T. pungens and the CNF samples. The 13C solid-state NMR spectra
of lignocellulosic materials can be divided into three regions. The
region up to 60 ppm is dedicated to aliphatic structures, the central
region between 60 and 110 ppm is related to the cellulosic polysaccharide
(carbons of carbohydrate), and the last region over 110 ppm (especially
the region between 110 and 160 ppm) is characterized by carbons in
aromatic lignin.35−37 For the water-washed T. pungens spectrum, signals at 21.2, 32.6, and 56.1 ppm are attributed to
the acetate methyl groups (CH3), methylene carbon (CH3), and the methoxyl groups (OCH3), respectively,
which are present in the xylan and lignin components.37 By increasing the concentration of sodium hydroxide during
alkali treatment, the intensity of these peaks was significantly reduced,
which confirmed the depletion of hemicellulose and lignin compared
to water-washed T. pungens.

Figure 4 Solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of water-washed and
treated T. pungens (0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF,
1 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 2 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 7 w/v % NaOH–CNF,
and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF).

The central region of 13C solid-state NMR is attributed
to the cellulosic polysaccharide, and the individual resonances of
carbon atoms in the β-d-glucose monomer are assigned
to C1 and C6, as illustrated in Figure S3. The signal assigned to C1 is at 105 ppm, whereas C2 and C3 with
C5 produce a broad band with two peaks at 72.3 and 74.7 ppm, respectively.
C4 and C6 are composed of two peaks, which are associated with crystalline
and amorphous cellulose, respectively. The signals at 83.8 and 62.5
ppm are attributed to the amorphous cellulose (crystal surfaces or
disordered cellulose) in C4 and C6, respectively. Furthermore, peaks
at 64.7 and 88.6 ppm are attributed to crystalline cellulose in C6
and C4, respectively.38−40 Study of 13C solid-state NMR from lignocellulosic
biomass is a useful tool to estimate the proportion of crystalline
and amorphous regions within a cellulose sample. C4 and C6 can be
fitted into a broad signal and a narrow signal, which correspond to
the amorphous and crystalline cellulose, respectively.41 It determined that by increasing the concentration
of sodium hydroxide during alkali treatment, the ratio of crystalline
cellulose relative to amorphous cellulose was increased (see Figures S4 and S5). In other words, treatment
with a higher concentration of sodium hydroxide increased the degree
of crystallinity of CNF, which is in agreement with the XRD results
and the previous study by Sun et al.38

In addition, Figures 4 and S5 show a broad signal of C6 for
water-washed T. pungens and CNF produced
after treatment with a low concentration of sodium hydroxide (Figure S5a–d), whereas the signal of C6
was divided into two distinct peaks for 7 and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF
(Figure S5e,f). This phenomenon can be
explained by the resonance overlap of xylan, as the most prevalent
noncellulose polysaccharide, and C6 in the cellulose structure. The
chemical shift of carbon-5 in the xylan (see the hemicellulose unit
structure in Figure S3) is at 63.3 ppm,35 and the disappearance of this signal from solid-state
NMR justifies the removal of hemicellulose during aggressive alkali
treatment, which is in agreement with previously discussed biochemical
composition results. Furthermore, the signal assigned to the carbon-4
in hemicellulose appeared around 81 ppm in the water-washed T. pungens but faded after treatment. This characterized
signal is the consequence of cellulose and xylan interaction and agglomeration,
which can be seen when hemicellulose and methyl moieties associate
with acetyl groups, generating signals at ∼172 and 21.2 ppm.35,42,43 These signals are only available
in the spectra of water-washed T. pungens and are significantly reduced after treatment, which highlights
the decomposition of connections between acetyl groups and hemicellulose.37

The region around 110 ppm indicates signals
assigned to aromatic
amino acid structures that exist within lignin components.44 Lignin, as a macromolecular biopolymer, is derived
from dehydrogenative polymerization of phenyl-propane units, including
syringyl (synapsyl alcohol), guaiacyl (coniferyl alcohol), and p-hydroxyphenyl (p-coumaryl alcohol).45,46 Resonance of carbons in these structures generates three signals
in the solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra, which are labeled
A1, A2, and A3 in the chemical shift of these peaks (δC), and corresponding carbons are listed and plotted in Table S3 and Figure S6, respectively.47 Integration of the area
between 110 and 160 ppm gives a ratio of the number of carbon in lignin
structures that initiate resonance.48Figure S6 shows this value for all samples, such
that the integrated value decreased by increasing the sodium hydroxide
concentration during alkali treatment. This is caused by the more
efficient removal of lignin from the T. pungens structure when using concentrated alkali hydroxide, which is in
agreement with the previously discussed results.

Surface Properties
of CNF
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) survey scan and C 1s high-resolution XPS spectra of water-washed
and treated T. pungens CNF samples
are shown in Table S4 and Figure 5a–f, respectively. Carbon
and oxygen were the predominant surface elements (about 97%), with
traces of silicon, nitrogen, and calcium detected as being taken up
by the grass root from the soil.49−51 The presence of fluorine
can be attributed to the sample preparation method, where samples
were dried between two Teflon sheets under pressure. The high-resolution
carbon spectra were fitted based on previously published papers [C
1s was fitted by C1 (C–C, C–H), C2 (C–O, used
as a reference peak at 286.73 eV and all C 1s charge shifts were corrected
based on C2 bonding position), C3 (C=O and O=C–O),
and C4 (COOH)].18,52 As shown in Figure 5a, the intensity of C1 for
the water-washed T. pungens is 52%,
whereas increasing the concentration of sodium hydroxide from 0.5
to 14 w/v % continually decreased the intensity of C1 to 24% for 14
w/v % NaOH–CNF (Figure 5f). C1 represents aliphatic and aromatic carbon backbones,
and in theory, cellulose with polysaccharide composition does not
include C1.53 Therefore, aggressive alkali
treatment removes more lignin, adventitious carbon, and extractives
(such as resins and fatty acids).54 On
the other hand, the intensity of C2, which is present in pure cellulose,
was increased by using a higher concentration of sodium hydroxide
for alkali treatment. For instance, the intensity of C2 in water-washed T. pungens and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF is 37 and
58%, respectively.

and
treated T. pungens at various sodium
hydroxide concentrations: (b) 0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF, (c) 1 w/v

and (f) 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF. (g) Correlation plot showing the
percentage of C–C components in samples vs the O/C ratio of
cellulose (calculated based on the presented value in Table S4), lignin, water-washed, and treated T. pungens samples.

Figure 5g
shows
that increasing the concentration of sodium hydroxide from 0.5 to
14 w/v % results in CNF transitioning from a lignin-like structure
(in theory, the O/C ratio vs C1 for lignin is 0.33 vs 0.5) to a cellulose-rich
structure (in theory, the O/C ratio vs C1 for pure cellulose is 0.83
vs 0).55

The water contact angle
measurement was employed to characterize
the surface tension and evaluate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties
of CNF nanopaper samples, as shown in Figure 6. This study showed that nanopapers made
of 0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF presented the highest contact angle value
with 69°, as a consequence of the higher content of lignin and
hemicellulose compared to other samples [as discussed in biochemical
composition, FT-IR, and XPS studies (shown schematically in Figure 6)]. It is well known
that these components reduce the material’s wettability.15 Furthermore, by increasing the concentration
of sodium hydroxide, the hydrophilicity of prepared CNF is steadily
increased, such that θ for 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF decreased
to ∼43°.

Figure 6 Water contact angle values for the CNF series (0.5 w/v
% NaOH–CNF,
1 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 2 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 7 w/v % NaOH–CNF,
and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF). This measurement was conducted on the
surface of prepared nanopaper samples. The incorporated schematic
describes the structural and compositional changes of CNF samples
with controlled alkali treatment.

Thermal Properties of CNF
The thermal decomposition
behavior of the lignocellulosic material, as well as their composition,
can be demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Figure 7a,b shows the weight
loss curve and first derivative of the weight loss curves versus temperature
[derivative thermogravimetric (DTG)] for water-washed and CNF samples
between 40 and 500 °C, respectively. These TGA curves consist
of three main phases. In the first phase, starting at 40 °C and
ending at 200 °C, the initial weight loss in the samples was
attributed to breakage of water–lignocellulosic bonds.56 The higher resolution of this phase is plotted
in Figure 7c, and it
can be seen that the moisture evaporation onset temperature for water-washed T. pungens is lower than the CNF samples. This indicates
that water molecules are weakly bound with components in the water-washed T. pungens, which consist of a higher content of
hydrophobic components, such as lignin and resin.15

Figure 7 (a) TGA and (b) DTG patterns of water-washed and treated T. pungens (0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 1 w/v % NaOH–CNF,
2 w/v % NaOH–CNF, 7 w/v % NaOH–CNF, and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF)
under a nitrogen flow.

In the second phase, between 200 and 315 °C, amorphous
structures
such as hemicellulose (i.e., xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose)
become depolymerized.56,57 In addition, lignin degradation
was initiated at this phase, but at a very low mass loss rate (less
than 0.14 wt %/°C, based on the Yang et al. study), and lasted
to a higher temperature (Yang et al. showed over 50 wt % of lignin
remained over 800 °C).57,58 The TGA and DTG curves
in this phase showed water-washed T. pungens had lost the maximum mass among all samples, started decomposition
at about 210 °C, and exhibited a DTG peak at 303 °C. It
is expected that the thermal stability of samples is enhanced in the
second phase by increasing the concentration of sodium hydroxide during
alkali treatment because of the removal of hemicellulose and lignin.
This phenomenon is obvious in Figure 7a,b, especially for 7 and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF
samples. As these samples (7 and 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF) contain
less hemicellulose in their biochemical composition (Figure 1), no peak can be distinguished
in the second phase of the DTG curve (Figure 7b).

The last phase of TGA took place
after 315 °C, which corresponds
to cellulose decomposition and main degradation steps accrue in this
stage. The TGA curves show the onset degradation temperature (Tonset) occurred at a higher temperature for
samples treated with concentrated sodium hydroxide. Furthermore, the
DTG curves that show the maximal weight loss temperature (Tmax) for all samples are within the same range,
between 354 and 361 °C, but the rate of cellulose degradation
is fairly inconsistent with respect to the sodium hydroxide concentration
for alkali treatment. It can be seen that the first derivative of
the weight loss (dTGA/dT) for water-washed T. pungens took place at −1.01 wt %/°C
and increased to −1.85 wt %/°C for 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF.
The residual masses at 500 °C were almost identical for all samples,
between 22 and 28 wt %. Overall, all of these results indicated that
the thermal stability of CNF was enhanced by increasing the concentration
of sodium hydroxide during treatment. This phenomenon can be explained
by two factors. First, concentrated sodium hydroxide removes more
hemicellulose and lignin during alkali treatment. Second, as discussed
in XRD and solid-state NMR studies, samples prepared with a higher
sodium hydroxide concentration consisted of a higher degree of ordered
crystalline regions (less amount of polymeric disorder or amorphous
structure). It is well known that this higher degree of crystallinity
has a predictable impact on the thermal stability of the material,
as a higher temperature and energy is necessary for degradation.56,59

Compatibilization and Reinforcement Effect in NR
To
demonstrate the functionality of this method for preparing CNF with
desired properties, a series of CNF samples were used to reinforce
prevulcanized NR latex. Several CNF/NR nanocomposites were prepared
with various CNF types (0.5 w/v % NaOH to 14 w/v % NaOH) and different
CNF loadings (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1 wt %). To determine the reinforcement
efficiency of CNF in the NR matrix, uniaxial tensile tests were performed
on the film samples, and the ultimate tensile stress and elongation
at break results are plotted in Figure 8. Furthermore, Figure S7a shows the stress at 300 and 700% elongation, and Figure S7b shows the toughness value (integration of the typical
stress–strain curve) of the nanocomposite samples.

Figure 8 Mechanical
properties [tensile stress (left axis) and tensile strain
(right axis)] of the control NR and CNF/NR nanocomposites with different
alkali treatment types (0.5–14 w/v %) and various CNF loading
concentrations (0.1–1 wt %).

The control sample exhibited 36.6 MPa and 1900% for tensile
stress
and elongation at break, respectively, indicating a very high-quality
commercial latex control. Moreover, the toughness value for the control
sample was 181 MJ m–3. The tensile strength of the
CNF/NR samples with 0.1 wt % CNF loading increased in comparison with
the control sample across the board, regardless of CNF type; although,
the degree of tensile strength increase varied based on the CNF type.
The tensile strength of 0.1 wt % (0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF)/NR improved
by 16% (to 42.4 MPa) is relative to the control sample, whereas the
degree of tensile strength enhancement decreased with increasing the
concentration of employed sodium hydroxide. The tensile strength of
0.1 wt % (14 w/v % NaOH–CNF)/NR was almost the same as the
control sample, at 36.7 MPa (0.3% improvement). It is well known that
excellent nanofiller dispersion, alongside proper adhesion and interface/interconnection
between nanofillers, and between the nanofiller and the matrix, are
the keys to achieving reinforcement in polymer nanocomposites.60 The very mild 0.5 w/v % NaOH-treated CNF was
composed of more hydrophobic surface functionality (Figure 6) compared to the 14 w/v %
NaOH–CNF, which is due to the presence of more lignin and hemicellulose,
as discussed in previous sections. Therefore, it was expected that
better dispersion and interfacial compatibility might be achieved
between the hydrophobic NR matrix and the most hydrophobic CNF filler
(0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF sample), compared to the 14 w/v % NaOH–CNF
sample. It was found that these nanofibers, at a low loading concentration
(0.1 wt %), can improve reinforcement with NR and without significantly
impacting the elongation at break (tensile strain) of the nanocomposite
films. It can be seen that the tensile strain only decreased 6% for
0.1 wt % (0.5 w/v % NaOH–CNF)/NR, but the tensile strain increased
8% for 0.1 wt % (2 w/v % NaOH–CNF)/NR. This can be attributed
to the average diameter size of 2 w/v % NaOH–CNF (14.8 nm),
which exhibited the thinnest nanofibers among all CNF samples in the
series, as shown in the TEM study (Figure 2). Larger CNF bundles could certainly act
as stress raisers and limit the ductility of the nanocomposite latex
films.

Accordingly, it can be seen in Figure 8 that the tensile stress and tensile strain
of CNF/NR nanocomposites decreased when increasing the loading concentration
of CNF for all CNF types. This phenomenon is attributed to the agglomeration
of CNF at higher loading (exaggerated by the high aspect ratio of
CNF from spinifex sources), resulting in inferior mechanical performance,
as reported in previous studies.18,28,61 In addition, although the semi cross-linked prevulcanized
NR latex was drying, the microscale globules of latex coalesce and
limit the interstitial space available for CNF accumulation.62 Thus, this degree of CNF agglomeration strongly
influences the mechanical performance of CNF/NR nanocomposites, as
the difference in Young’s modulus between the nanofiller and
host polymer is usually the instigator of cracking in these systems.

To fabricate high-quality NR nanocomposites for applications such
as gloves and condoms, it is necessary to increase the toughness of
the nanocomposites without compromising compliance. Figure S7a shows the stress at 300 and 700% strain as a factor
of stiffness for the prepared NR nanocomposite films. The stress at
these elongations was slightly increased with respect to increasing
CNF concentration, indicating that nanocomposite preparation at low
CNF loadings (0.1 and 0.3 wt %) can reinforce latex without significantly
impacting film stiffness. Furthermore, the toughness value for all
samples is plotted in Figure S7b. The toughness
values for 0.1 wt % (0.5 w/v % CNF–NaOH)/NR and 0.1 wt % (1
w/v % CNF–NaOH)/NR films were found to increase by 9 and 6%
compared to the control sample, respectively. With respect to the
observed increase in the elongation at break for the 0.1 wt % (2 w/v
% CNF–NaOH)/NR film, the toughness was also enhanced by 19%
(215.6 MJ m–3). Toughness values were very similar
to the control sample for 0.1 wt % (7 w/v % CNF–NaOH)/NR, 0.1
wt % (14 w/v % CNF–NaOH)/NR, and 0.3 wt % (0.5 w/v % CNF–NaOH)/NR.
By increasing the CNF loading from 0.1 to 1 wt % and increasing the
concentration of sodium hydroxide from 0.5 to 14 w/v % during the
alkali treatment, the toughness value of NR nanocomposite films was
decreased.

Conclusions
In this work, an efficient,
inexpensive, and environmentally friendly
treatment process was proposed to isolate a series of CNFs from T. pungens spinifex grass with distinct composition
and surface chemistry. This treatment process involved analyzing the
effect of different sodium hydroxide concentrations in cellulose nanofibrillation.
Comprehensive characterization tools demonstrated that CNF properties
and performance could be tuned by controlling the concentration of
sodium hydroxide during treatment. It was concluded that sodium hydroxide
has a significant effect on the size, surface tension, degree of residual
lignin and hemicellulose, and the crystallinity of isolated CNF. The
tensile strength of industrial grade prevulcanized NR latex was enhanced
by 16% with the incorporation of 0.1 wt % CNF (at 0.5 w/v % NaOH),
whereas the toughness increased and the tensile strain was not significantly
affected. On the basis of the current experiment, this fibrillation
strategy is an efficient and practical approach for obtaining CNF
with tuned interfacial chemistry, highlighting this process’
potential of handling large-scale production for many different applications.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of CNF
Preparation of CNF consisted of
two steps: controlled alkali treatment and high shear disintegration
via HPH. Overnight deionized (DI) water soaked T. pungens (grass to water ratio of 1:10) was heated to 80 °C and treated
with various sodium hydroxide concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 7, and 14
w/v %), such that alkali treating of 10 g of T. pungens at 0.5 w/v % NaOH would require 0.5 g of sodium hydroxide and 100
mL of DI water. After being stirred for 2 h, alkali-treated pulp was
obtained by filtering and washing several times with 60 °C water.
Then, the pulp was diluted with DI water to a concentration of approximately
3–4 mg mL–1 and fibrillated by passing through
a high-pressure homogenizer (GEA homogenizer, Panda 2K NS1001L, GEA
Niro Soavi S.P.A., Italy) once at a pressure of 400 bar and 4 passes
at a pressure of 700 bar.

Preparation of Control NR and CNF/NR Nanocomposite
Samples
Prevulcanized NR latex was used to prepare control
and CNF/NR nanocomposite
films. After overhead stirring at a speed of 35 rpm for 30 min, the
solid content of the NR latex was reduced from 60 to 45 wt % with
an aqueous ammonia alkali solution at pH = 10.5 (for the latex control),
or a dispersed CNF aqueous alkali solution (pH = 10.5) with different
CNF concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1 wt % (for nanocomposite
latex preparations). Stirring was continued for 1 h at 35 rpm, then
for 24 h at 12 rpm to complete CNF dispersion and deaeration. Prepared
mixtures were cast into glass molds and kept at room temperature overnight
to form dry films. Dried films were then dusted with calcium carbonate
powder (to prevent films’ tackiness) and leached with hot water
(65 °C) for 10 min. Vulcanization was performed by curing samples
at 110 °C for 6 h under a gentle flow of dry nitrogen. All samples
were rested for at least 48 h within laboratory conditions (room temperature
and 50% humidity) before further characterization. Samples were labeled
according to their CNF concentration and alkali treatment regimen.
