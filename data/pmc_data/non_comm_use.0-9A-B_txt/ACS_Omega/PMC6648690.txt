Aldehydes
are easily transformed into vicinal diamines and piperazines
through a one-pot procedure including a Darzens reaction and treatment
with an amine or diamine and then with a reducing agent. Additionally,
quinoxalines can be accessed by reaction with 1,2-benzenediamine under
oxidative conditions. These transformations are simple methods for
the preparation of synthetically interesting monosubstituted diamines,
piperazines, and quinoxalines.

Introduction
Vicinal diamines are
important building blocks found in many bioactive
molecules (Figure 1),1 natural products,2 and metal complexes displaying interesting properties.3 Also, quinoxalines and piperazines have interesting
medical properties. For instance, quinoxaline derivatives display
anticancer,4 antiviral,5 antibacterial,6 anti-inflammatory,7 and antibiotic8 activities.
A piperazine moiety is considered a “privileged scaffold”
in medicinal chemistry9 and is present
in many biologically active molecules.

(b) Reaction design.

Monosubstituted vicinal diamines are present in potent bioactive
compounds such as tetracyclic antidepressants1 mianserin and mirtazapine or k-opioid antagonist ICI-1994411e (Figure 1A). Although interesting approaches have been recently reported
for the preparation of monosubstituted10 and disubstituted11 diamines, more approaches
are welcome.

We report herein the preparation of monosubstituted
diamines from
aldehydes in a one-pot three-step process. The process comprises first
the formation of an epoxysulfone by a Darzens reaction between an
aldehyde and chloromethylphenylsulfone and then addition of an amine
attacking the β position of the epoxide, affording an α-aminoaldehyde,
which upon reductive amination with a second amine gives the corresponding
diamine (Figure 1B).
This chemical transformation is inspired by our previous work about
chemical transformations of nitroepoxides.11

Results and Discussion
We first prepared epoxysulfone 1a through a Darzens
reaction between benzaldehyde and chloromethylphenylsulfone. Then,
epoxysulfone 1a was combined with benzylamine in dichloromethane
(DCM) for 8 h at room temperature, and then sodium borohydride was
added. The reaction worked satisfactorily, affording diamine 2a (Scheme 1). However, the conversion of epoxysulfone 1a into diamine 2a was very low yielding.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Diamines through Epoxysulfones
Hence, we turned our attention
to a one-pot procedure for the transformation
of aldehydes into diamines by combining the four reactions shown in Scheme 1. One-pot procedures
represent interesting synthetic approaches,12 which might improve yields as compared to step-wise sequences. First,
benzaldehyde was reacted with chloromethylphenylsulfone previously
treated with sodium tert-butoxide in dichloromethane.
After the mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0 °C and then for 1
h at room temperature, benzylamine (3 equiv.) was added, and the resulting
mixture was stirred for 8 h at room temperature and then sodium borohydride
(6 equiv.) was added and stirred again for 8 h. Under these experimental
conditions, diamines were obtained but chemical yields were not satisfying
(Table 1, entries 4,
7, and 9). Under these conditions, the corresponding benzyl p-methylbenzyl amine was also isolated when using p-tolualdehyde, denoting an undesired attack of the benzylamine
on the epoxysulfone (Scheme 2).

a Reactions were performed using benzylamine
(4 equiv.) and sodium borohydride (8 equiv.) at 0 °C.

b Yield of the isolated product.

c Reactions were carried out at room
temperature.

d The reaction
was carried out by
adding lithium chloride (10 equiv.).

e The reaction was carried out under
phase-transfer conditions with aq. NaOH (50%) (1 mL/mmol) and tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (0.2 equiv.).

f Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (8
equiv.) was used instead of sodium borohydride.

To increase the yield, an optimization
process was performed by
modifying the temperature, solvent, and number of equivalents. Higher
yields were obtained when a temperature of 0 °C was kept during
the amine treatment, favoring the attack of the amine at the β-position.
This slowed the reaction, and the duration for that step had to be
increased up to 18 h. Optimized conditions also comprise an increase
of the number of equivalents of amine and sodium borohydride (4 and
8, respectively). A screening of solvents gave 1,2-dichloroethane
as the best option in all cases (entries 1, 5, 8, and 13). Probably,
the improvement of the yield with 1,2-dichloroethane as compared to
dichloromethane is due to its lower volatility avoiding losses of
solvents after such a long reaction time. Other assayed conditions
such as the use of lithium chloride as an additive and tetrahydrofuran
(THF) as a solvent (entry 9), phase-transfer conditions (entry 10),
or the use of sodium triacetoxyborohydride instead of sodium borohydride
(entry 11) did not improve the yield.

Aliphatic aldehydes (propionaldehyde
and isobutyraldehyde) and
ortho-substituted aromatic aldehydes (2-chlorobenzaldehyde) were also
assayed under different conditions, but only traces of desired diamines
were detected. Then, we assayed the use of two different amines during
the process instead of only one. Thus, N-benzylmethylamine
(4 equiv.) was added first, then benzylamine (4 equiv.) was added
when TLC showed total consumption of epoxysulfone and finally sodium
borohydride. Following this procedure, diamines 2e–h were prepared (Scheme 3). However, when benzaldehyde was first treated with
benzylamine and N-benzylmethylamine was then added,
diamine 2a was obtained. Presumably, the aminoaldehyde
intermediate resulting from the opening of epoxysulfone by benzylamine
(see Figure 1b) reacts
with a second equivalent of benzylamine to give a corresponding imine
in contrast with N-benzylmethylamine. The same experimental
procedure was also used for diamines 2e–h, using morpholine instead of N-benzylmethylamine,
and only traces of desired diamines were detected.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Differently
Substituted Diamines from Aldehydes
Then, we extended the study to the use of other amines
different
from benzylamines. When optimized experimental conditions (Table 1) were applied but n-butylamine was used as a starting material instead of
benzylamine, the chemical yield of desired diamines was very low,
even when the reaction was performed at room temperature or at reflux.
To activate epoxysulfone for the amine attack, Lewis acids were added
to the reaction mixture after epoxysulfone formation. Magnesium bromide,
magnesium sulfate, and titanium isopropoxide had no effect on the
reactivity of epoxysulfones. However, the addition of lithium chloride
(10 equiv.) afforded the desired diamines 2i–j (Scheme 4). Tetrahydrofuran gave higher yields than dichloroethane probably
because of the higher solubility of lithium chloride.

Scheme 4 Synthesis
of Diamines from Aliphatic Amines
Cyclic diamines were also prepared. Piperazines 3a and 3b were prepared following the same experimental
conditions as those for diamines starting from benzaldehyde and tolualdehyde,
respectively (Scheme 5). Quinoxaline 4 was prepared using 1,2-benzenediamine
and in the presence of air13 (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Cyclic
Diamines
Conclusions
In
summary, we reported herein that 1,2-diamines, piperazines,
and quinoxalines can be prepared starting from aldehydes. It is a
one-pot procedure through three steps: A Darzens reaction with chloromethylsulfone
and sodium tert-butoxide, treatment with an excess
of amines or diamines, and reductive treatment to afford corresponding
diamines. Also, quinoxalines can be prepared in a similar manner but
using 1,2-benzenediamine upon oxidative conditions. Further research
related to the synthetic use of epoxysulfones is going on in our lab
and will be reported in the near future.

General Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis of Epoxysulfone
1a
t-BuONa (1.1 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) was slowly
added to a cold (0 °C) stirred solution of chloromethyl phenyl
sulfone (1.1 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) in THF (5 mL). The mixture was stirred
for 15 min, followed by dropwise addition of a solution of the corresponding
aldehyde (1 mmol, 1 equiv.) in THF (5 mL). The reaction mixture was
then stirred for 30 min and monitored by TLC. Quenching was done by
adding ammonium chloride saturated aqueous solution (10 mL), and then
the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature before being extracted
with ethyl ether (3 × 10 mL). The organic layers were washed
with 1 M hydrochloric acid (10 mL), then with sodium bicarbonate saturated
aqueous solution (10 mL), and finally with brine; then, the layers
were dried using Na2SO4 and concentrated under
vacuum. The crude material was purified using chromatography (silica
gel, hexanes/ethyl acetate (9:1 to 7:3)) to give the pure compound.

General Experimental Procedure
for the Synthesis of Diamines
To an ice-cold, stirred solution
of the corresponding epoxysulfone
(1 mmol, 1 equiv.) in DCM (10 mL), the corresponding amine (3 mmol,
3 equiv.) was slowly added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 8
h, and then NaBH4 (6 mmol, 6 equiv.) was added portionwise.
The reaction mixture was then stirred for 1.5 h and was monitored
by TLC. Then, it was quenched by ammonium chloride saturated aqueous
solution (10 mL) and was allowed to warm to room temperature before
being extracted with DCM (3 × 10 mL). The organic layers resulting
from the extraction were washed with 1 M hydrochloric acid (10 mL),
then with sodium bicarbonate saturated aqueous solution (10 mL), and
finally with brine; then, these layers were dried using Na2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum. The resulting crude
material was purified by chromatography (silica gel, hexanes/ethyl
acetate (7:3 to 1:1)) to give the desired pure compound.

Method A
t-BuONa (1.2 mmol, 1.2 equiv.)
was added to a 0 °C cold solution of chloromethyl phenyl sulfone
(1.2 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) in DCE (5 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred
for 15 min, and then the corresponding aldehyde (1 mmol, 1 equiv.)
dissolved in DCE (5 mL) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred
for 1 h in a cold ice-bath and then for 1 h at room temperature until
complete formation of epoxysulfone as monitored by TLC. Then, the
reaction mixture was cooled at 0 °C and the amine (4 mmol, 4
equiv.) was slowly added. The reaction mixture was kept for 18 h at
−8 °C, and then NaBH4 (8 mmol, 8 equiv.) was
slowly added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 8 h. Then, it
was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride aqueous solution (10
mL) and was allowed to warm up to room temperature and extracted with
DCM (3 × 10 mL). The organic layers were washed with 1 M hydrochloric
acid (10 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (10 mL),
and brine; dried using Na2SO4; and concentrated
under vacuum. The crude mixture was purified by chromatography (silica
gel, hexanes/ethyl acetate (7:3 to 1:1)) to afford the pure compound.

Method B
t-BuONa (1.2 mmol, 1.2 equiv.)
was added to an ice-cold solution of chloromethyl phenyl sulfone (1.2
mmol, 1.2 equiv.) in THF (5 mL). The mixture was stirred for 15 min;
then, the corresponding aldehyde (1 mmol, 1 equiv.) was slowly added
as a solution in THF (5 mL). The reaction mixture was then stirred
for 1 h at 0 °C and for 1 h at room temperature. When TLC showed
complete formation of epoxysulfone, the reaction was cooled at −8
°C and the corresponding amine (4 mmol, 4 equiv.) was added followed
by addition of LiCl (10 mmol, 10 equiv.). The reaction mixture was
kept for 18 h at −8 °C. Then, NaBH4 (8 mmol,
8 equiv.) was added portionwise, and the resulting mixture was stirred
for additional 8 h. Finally, the reaction mixture was quenched with
saturated ammonium chloride aqueous solution (10 mL) and was then
allowed to warm up to room temperature. Then, it was extracted with
DCM (3 × 10 mL). The resulting organic layers were washed with
1 M hydrochloric acid (10 mL), then with sodium bicarbonate saturated
aqueous solution (10 mL), and finally with brine. Washed organic portion
was dried using Na2SO4 and concentrated under
vacuum. The resulting crude material was purified by chromatography
(silica gel, hexanes/ethyl acetate (7:3 to 1:1)) to give the desired
compound.
