In this publication, a copper acetate-mediated
rhodanine polymerization
reaction is examined. It is demonstrated that at room temperature,
Cu(II) acetate complexes with rhodanine generate solid nanospheres,
which, upon heating in a microwave, results in polyrhodanine core–shell
nano- and microsphere particles. The structural analysis of the polyrhodanine
nanosphere produced by this efficient microwave-initiated method was
conducted by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV–vis
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron
microscopy. In addition, it is verified that this template-free, efficient,
and versatile synthesis of polyrhodanine nanospheres can also be accomplished
by introducing a strong oxidant KMnO4 as a cocatalyst with
copper acetate without compromising the morphology of the resulting
core–shell nanospheres. It is also demonstrated that the polyrhodanine
nanospheres can be used to adsorb methyl orange dye, a known contaminant
in industrial wastewater.

1 Introduction
The
conjugation of conducting polymers (polypyrrole, polyaniline,
polythiophene, and polyrhodanine) with inorganic complexes provides
materials with promising and attractive properties for their application
in new and diverse technologies.1 In recent
years, rhodanine (Rh) and its derivatives have attracted attention
because of their antibacterial, antiviral, antihistaminic, and anticorrosion
properties.2 Electrochemically synthesized
high-quality polyrhodanine (pRh) films prepared by Kardaş and
co-workers3 and silver/pRh nanotubes and
nanofiber composite materials synthesized by Jang and co-workers3 exhibit a very high antimicrobial efficacy against
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and yeast. A green approach
to the cellulose nanocrystal Fe(III) complex-coated pRh in aqueous
medium and silica-coated pRh/silver nanocomposite exhibits sustainable
antimicrobial properties for applications in food packaging, antimicrobial
coatings, and additives.4 It has also been
demonstrated that the pRh-immobilized anodic aluminum oxide membrane
fabricated via vapor deposition polymerization can chemically absorb
metals like Ag(I), Hg(II), and Pb(II) ions, and the pRh/isobutyltriethoxysilane
films can effectively hinder the access of chloride ions to the stainless
steel surface providing anticorrosion properties.5 In all these cases, pRh was found to have a tubular or
fibril morphology.

Hollow polymeric particles have stimulated
an increasing interest
in the area of material science because of their large surface area,
tunable particle diameter and shell thickness, and low permeability
and density. Owing to these properties, the nanosized spheres find
applications in medicine, biology, and industry, for instance, as
nano-/microreaction vessels, targeted drug delivery, controlled release,
photocatalysis, and synthetic pigments at industrial scale.6−8 Because of our interest in these applications, we have been exploring
ways to selectively synthesize polymeric nano-/microspheres in good
yield and under mild reaction conditions.

To the best of our
knowledge, there are no reports for the direct
one-pot, green synthesis of pRh nano-/microspheres. In this work,
we report a facile, single-step, green synthesis of pRh core–shell
micro-/nanospheres, with copper acetate as the oxidizing agent (Scheme 1). The polymerization
of Rh is carried out using a microwave synthetic protocol under mild
reaction conditions. The reaction selectively produces pRh microspheres,
and it does not require templates to control the morphology. Moreover,
this transformation can be carried out in green solvents such as water
or ethanol. The composite oxidants KMnO4 and Cu(OAc)2 exhibited faster formation processes and almost a quantitative
conversion of Rh to pRh nano-/microspheres. However, in the absence
of Cu(OAc)2, KMnO4, being a strong oxidant,
produces a porous nonspherical pRh composite material. In addition,
we demonstrate in this article the utility of pRh micro-/nanospheres
as adsorbents for the methyl orange (MO) dye in aqueous solutions.

Scheme 1 Reaction of Rhodanine to Produce Polyrhodanine–Cu(II) Complex
Nanospheres
2 Results
and Discussion
The preliminary experiments were carried out
under various reaction
conditions and molar ratios to examine the morphological evolution
of the pRh polymers in the presence of copper acetate. We observed
an instant reaction of the ethanolic solution of rhodanine monomer
with equimolar amounts of copper(II) acetate at room temperature (RT)
to produce an olive green precipitate of the rhodanine–Cu(II)
complex P1. The amount of the precipitate keeps increasing
till 2 h of the reaction at RT or on heating the reaction mixture
for 30 min. An idealized structure of the proposed complex is shown
in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Reaction
of Rhodanine with Copper Acetate to Produce Olive Green
Rhodanine–Cu(II) Complex
The initial reaction in this oxidative oligo-/polymerization
process
between Rh and Cu2+ takes place, in which a complex of
Rh with copper is formed by the deprotonation of the amide group and
coordination of the nitrogen, sulfur, and/or carbonyl group with the
Cu(II) ion to produce the rhodanine–Cu(II) complex P1. This conclusion was drawn from a comparative Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysis of the pristine Rh and pRh–Cu(II) complex (Figure 1) as well as from the precedent literature, where pRh has
been isolated and characterized by IR spectroscopy.3 The FT-IR analysis clearly indicates the deprotonation
of the NH bond, as evidenced by the disappearance of the bands associated
with NH (3172, 3087, and 1439 cm–1). In addition,
a red shift occurs in the C=S band (from 1075 cm–1 in Rh to 1018 cm–1 in the Rh–Cu(II) complex) and in the carbonyl (C=O) band (from 1709 in Rh
to 1689 cm–1 Rh–Cu(II) complex).
These data suggest several modes of coordination (N, S, O) of Rh with
Cu(II) in the complex.9

Figure 1 IR spectroscopy of rhodanine
and rhodanine–Cu(II) complex.

The morphological analysis of the olive green complex P1 was also performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2). These analyses provided further insights
into the structural features of the Cu–Rh complex P1. To our surprise, we found that the morphology of the complex P1 is spherical, and the size of these microspheres was found
to be in the range of 20–200 nm. It was observed that the same
products were obtained when the reaction was carried out in water.
In the case of water as the solvent, the particles were found to be
smaller in diameter and visually more porous than the particles obtained
in the case of ethanol as the solvent.

Figure 2 TEM (A) and SEM (B) analyses
of the olive green rhodanine–Cu(II)
complex.

To fully investigate this process,
further reactions of the P1 complex were investigated
in detail. After the initial
formation of the complex P1 (Scheme 3), if the reaction was continued in the microwave
at 80 °C for 10 h, a black precipitate was obtained, which was
centrifuged, separated, and washed several times with ethanol and
air-dried. In the FT-IR spectra of this product, signal broadening
is observed, which is attributed to the formation of the pRh polymer.3 Because of the polymerization, a new set of peaks
at 1559 cm–1 of C=N stretching vibration
and 1652 cm–1 for C=C stretching vibration
also appears. The peak at 1407 cm–1 was assigned
to the C=N+ stretching and the peak at 1181 cm–1 is assigned to C–O–. Similar
to FT-IR, Raman analysis shows broadening of signals because of polymerization.
Some noteworthy peaks in the polymer include 1559, 1098, and 558 cm–1 for the N–C stretch; 447 cm–1 for the C–S stretch and C=S stretch for out-of-plane
deformation (see the Supporting Information).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Core–Shell pRh
The UV–vis spectra of Rh in ethanol display two
bands, with
the maxima in the ranges 230–274 and 295–308 nm, which
are associated with three chromophore groups (Figure 3): the thioamide group in the 230–274
nm range and the amide and dithio groups in the 295–308 nm
range. In Figure 3,
the UV–vis plots of the soluble part of the reaction mixture
are shown after 3, 6, and 9 h of the reaction in the microwave. It
is quite evident that as the reaction proceeds, new broad absorption
bands appear between the 360 and 580 nm maxima centered at 420 nm.
The peak devolution of pRh in 1 M NaOH solution shows 360 nm due to
n–p* transition, 520–580 nm Cu0 Plasmon resonance
and 460 nm originates from pRh backbone.3 It should be pointed out that because of the poor solubility of
the core–shell pRh, it is difficult to analyze or monitor the
progress of this reaction via the UV–vis spectra.

Figure 3 Monitoring
of the formation of the core–shell pRh nanoparticles
obtained in a microwave by UV–vis spectroscopy.

The TEM and SEM studies were performed to elucidate
the morphology
of the pRh product. To our surprise, the morphology of the precursor
complex P1 was retained, but now the spheres were converted
into the pRh core–shell nanospheres (Scheme 3 and Figure 4). It was observed that each sphere has a core with
smooth surface and a shell with a rough outside surface. There was
a dark inner solid core, an inner middle cavity which is lighter,
and a dark outer shell (Figure 4A). According to earlier reports, pRh nanofibers with silver
ions and electrochemical film formation on copper surfaces are known.3,10 In our studies, the core–shell micro-/nanostructures were
obtained by the simple copper(II)-promoted self-assembly method in
green solvents such as ethanol. Similar structures were obtained when
the reactions were carried out in water.

Figure 4 TEM (A) and SEM (B) micrographs
of the core–shell pRh nanoparticles
obtained in a microwave.

This template-free method can be scaled for large-scale pRh
nanosphere
synthesis without tedious synthesis and the complication of template
removal. Though the detailed mechanistic studies are underway, our
preliminary studies (see Scheme 4) indicate that at the initial stage of formation,
the Rh–Cu(II) complex adopts the nano- and microsphere morphology,
most probably driven by Cu-complexation to Rh. On heating the complex,
in a microwave or under reflux conditions, Ostwald ripening process
occurs. In this ripening process, the rhodanine in solution undergoes
polymerization via the autocatalytic electrochemical pathway on the
surface of the microspheres, creating a hard shell.11 The complex inside the solid sphere has a strong tendency
to dissolve slowly as the reaction progresses and deposits on the
surface of the sphere, leading to the formation of core–shell
structures as a black precipitate. The proposed mechanism is supported
by the fact that the complex structures are solid spheres, whereas
the TEM images taken at different time intervals of the reaction mixtures
show spheres with and without the core–shell structures till
the reaction is complete. The TEM images taken at different time intervals
are shown in the Supporting Information.

Scheme 4 Mechanistic Proposal and Cartoon Illustration of the Formation
of
Core–Shell Nanostructures
To investigate the generality of the core–shell
nanosphere
formation, this reaction was investigated in the presence of strong
oxidants such as KMnO4. As KMnO4 is a comparatively
stronger oxidant, it can be expected to speed up the polymerization
reaction. To examine this hypothesis, KMnO4 and rhodanine
were reacted under identical reaction conditions, but without Cu(OAc)2 (Scheme 5).
This reaction was faster, and a colorless solution with black precipitate
was obtained after 4 h of reaction. As expected, pRh formation was
observed. However, to our surprise, when TEM analysis was performed,
it was found that the resulting pRH morphology was not that of the
microspheres.

Scheme 5 Reaction of Rhodanine with KMnO4
This led us to examine the
synthesis of pRh in the presence of
the composite catalyst Cu(OAc)2 and KMnO4 in
ethanol. This time again, the reaction was as fast as before and showed
a complete precipitation of pRh after 4 h of heating in the microwave.
The black precipitate product was removed via centrifugation, and
the remaining supernatant solution was examined via UV–vis
spectroscopy. The UV–vis analysis indicated a marked decrease
in the concentration of Rh monomer in the solution, indicating the
complete conversion to polyrhodanine. When this black solid was examined
by TEM, the same core–shell structures were observed. These
results clearly indicated that pRh formation takes place via the redox
process; however, the spherical polymer can only be generated in the
presence of Cu(II) acetate.

In Table 1, various
reaction conditions and morphologies of the resulting polyrhodanines
are summarized.

To examine the utility of the pRh core–shell
structures,
the remediation of the dye-contaminated wastewater, one of the many
green applications of these polyrhodanine particles, was considered.
In addition, this investigation can have broad implications because
the applications of dyes in food, cosmetics, textile, and paper industries
lead to the leaching of dyes in wastewater streams. For example, MO
dye is a known contaminant in industrial wastewater. We wanted to
examine the suitability of the pRH nanoparticles for the removal of
the MO dye from aqueous solutions. For this study, the pRH nanocomposite
prepared according to the method in Section 3.3 (see the Experimental
Section) was used. UV–vis spectroscopy was selected
to monitor the MO absorption (Figure 5). In this preliminary study, to our surprise, we found
that when the aqueous solution of MO was stirred with the pRH nanocomposite,
within 3 h, about 80% of the MO dye was absorbed by the pRh nanocomposite.
If the reaction was continued for longer times, the absorption remained
around 80%. This facile absorption study bodes well for the application
of the pRh nano-/microspheres. The detailed dye absorption studies
are underway in our laboratories, and their results will be disclosed
in due time.

3 Experimental Section
The detailed experimental
procedures and analysis are provided
in the Supporting Information.

3.1 Microwave Synthesis of pRh Core–Shell
Nanoparticles with Copper Acetate
In a typical procedure,
rhodanine monomer (0.2 mM) was dissolved in ethanol (15 mL) under
stirring in a 20 mL Biotage microwave vial; then, copper(II) acetate
(0.2 mM) was introduced into the rhodanine solution at RT. As soon
as Cu(OAc)2 was added to the stirred solution, a green
precipitate of the Cu(II)–Rh complex was formed, which was
then heated in a microwave at 80 °C for 10 h. During this period,
the reaction was monitored intermittently by UV–vis and IR
spectroscopy. After 9–10 h of the reaction, a black precipitate
was obtained. This black precipitate was centrifuged, and the supernatant
greenish yellow solution was carefully separated and discarded. The
black solid was washed four times with 3 mL of ethanol and air-dried
for 24 h. The elemental analysis of this solid was also performed.
The CHN analysis indicated 8.16% C, 0.47% H, and 3.50% of N. The inductively
coupled plasma–mass spectrometry analysis of the same sample
showed that 55.9% of Cu was also present. A comparison to the expected
C, H, N, and Cu percentage based on the idealized Cu-complexed polymer
structure was found to be 8.95% C; 0.5% H; 3.48% N, and 55.24% of
Cu. The same procedure was repeated using deionized water as the solvent.

3.2 Thermal Synthesis of pRh Core–Shell
Nanoparticles with Copper Acetate
In a typical procedure,
in a 150 mL two-neck round-bottom flask, rhodanine monomer (0.2 mM)
was dissolved in ethanol (15 mL), and copper(II) acetate (0.2 mM)
was introduced into the rhodanine solution at RT. As soon as Cu(OAc)2 was added to the stirred solution, an olive green precipitate
of the Cu(II)–Rh complex was formed, which was then heated
in an oil bath at 75 °C. After 96 h of the reaction at 75 °C,
a black precipitate was obtained. The black precipitate was centrifuged,
and the supernatant solution was carefully separated and discarded.
The solid black product was washed four times with 3 mL of ethanol,
air-dried for 24 h, and analyzed. The same procedure was repeated
using deionized water as the solvent.

3.3 Microwave
Synthesis of pRh with Composite
Catalysts
The rhodanine monomer (0.2 mM) was dissolved in
ethanol (15 mL) under stirring in a 20 mL Biotage microwave vial,
and copper(II) acetate (0.2 mM) was introduced into the rhodanine
solution at RT. To the green suspension of the Cu(II)–Rh complex
formed by the above reaction, potassium permanganate (0.2 mM) was
added. This solution was heated in a microwave at 80 °C and intermittently
analyzed by the UV–vis and IR spectra. The supernatant solution
was colorless and a black precipitate was obtained after 4 h of the
reaction. The reaction was deemed complete now, and the mixture was
centrifuged. After centrifugation, a black solid was obtained, which
was washed four times with 3 mL of ethanol and then air-dried for
24 h and analyzed. The IR and UV–vis analyses of the supernatant
liquid showed only traces of unreacted Cu(II)–Rh complex or
polyrhodanine.

3.4 Synthesis of pRh with KMnO4 as
Oxidant
The rhodanine monomer (0.2 mM) was dissolved in ethanol
(15 mL) under stirring in a 20 mL Biotage microwave vial, and potassium
permanganate (0.2 mM) was added to this solution. No precipitation/suspension
formation occurred at RT, and after heating the solution at 80 °C
in the microwave for 4 h, a black precipitate was obtained. The solid
was centrifuged, washed four times with 3 mL of ethanol, and air-dried
for 24 h.

3.5 Adsorption of MO by pRh
In a 50 mL
round-bottom flask, 20 mL of 0.00303 M MO solution prepared by dissolving
0.001 mol of MO in 0.330 L of deionized water was added under stirring
at RT, and 0.0140 g of pRh was added to this solution. The suspension
was stirred at RT and monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy. For
UV–vis measurements, a 3 mL aliquot of the reaction mixture
was taken out every hour and centrifuged. The supernatant liquid was
collected, and 0.2 mL of this solution was diluted with 3.4 mL of
deionized water for every UV–vis measurement.
