The evaluation of fat and moisture contents for olive
fruits is crucial for both olive growers and olive oil processors.
Reference methods, such as Soxhlet extraction, used for fat content
determination in olive fruits are time- and solvent- consuming and
labor intensive. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is proposed as a
solution toward rapid and nondestructive analyses of olive fruit fat
and moisture contents. In the present work, comparative studies of
the fat and moisture quantification methods were performed on four
cultivars (Arbosana, Arbequina, Chiquitita, and Koroneiki) during
six different harvesting time points to determine the potential of
NIR as an alternative methodology. The impact of olive paste crushing
degree on NIR performance was also investigated using three different
grid sizes (4, 6, and 8 mm) on a hammer mill, in addition to a blade
crusher. Results indicate a satisfactory correlation between the reference
Soxhlet and NIR methods with R2 = 0.995.
A comparison study of moisture content was also done on NIR and the
use of conventional oven with the R2 value
of 0.995. The crushing blade produced higher values in both moisture
and fat contents in comparison to the hammer mill. The evaluation
indicates that when building a chemometric model, all crush sizes
and blade sizes should be represented in the model for highest accuracy.

1 Introduction
As olive oil began to gain popularity in the consumer market, a growing
emphasis on optimizing the olive oil extraction processes and the
quality of the oil appeared. Virgin olive oil is extracted from the
fruit of Olea Europaea L. by crushing
the olive fruit, mixing the resulting paste in a malaxer, and separating
the oil by centrifugation. The quality of olive oil relies on the
quality of the olive fruit.1 Fat and moisture
content determinations are routine measurements performed to establish
optimum harvest time since they have effects on the efficiency of
oil extraction and the quality of oil.

At commercial laboratories,
traditional analytical techniques, like gravimetry with conventional
oven and Soxhlet extraction, are commonly used. Although these techniques
are widely accepted as reference methods, the determination of olive
moisture content is often labor intensive and time consuming. Moreover,
not only does the Soxhlet extraction often require long extraction
time, but is highly solvent consuming and impractical. Near-infrared
(NIR) spectroscopy is an alternative solution toward a rapid and safe
analysis of olive fruits. NIR requires little sample preparation and
is consider safer than traditional wet chemistry analytical techniques
such that it does not require any hazardous chemicals. However, expertize
in chemometric analysis is often a requirement, especially to offer
calibrations that are robust and reliable. Although a model needs
to be established and optimized with specific olive fruit samples,
once the calibration model is build, it can produce results comparable
to reference methods.

Literature shows the feasibility of NIR
as an alternative method to determine fat and moisture contents2−9 as well as to quantify
parameters associated with the quality of olives, such as fatty acid
composition and characterization of geographic origin.10−13

Furthermore, NIR has recently been shown to be applicable to process
monitoring to ensure the quality of the olive products, including
olive oils, olive pomace, and olive fruits.11,14−17 A study by Bendini et al. demonstrated a satisfactory
correlation for moisture content and fatty acid using an at-line NIR
instrument with the coupling of partial least squares (PLS) regression
models.11 The application of NIR to on-line
control quality and characterization of virgin olive oil where acidity
value (R2 = 0.999), bitter taste (R2 = 0.936), fatty acid oleic (R2 = 0.998), and fatty acid linoleic (R2 = 0.992) were study.14 Mailer
et al. developed NIR calibrations for various quality parameters in
olive oil, such as free fatty acid, peroxide value, polyphenol content,
induction time, chlorophyll, and fatty acid, which allows routine
screening of olive oil.15 Mesa et al. showed
the potential ability for NIR to analyze oil and moisture in two-phase
olive pomace.17

NIR has demonstrated
many advantages, but the cost of installment may limit the accessibility
of NIR to many industries. Nevertheless, the integration of in-process
monitoring may prevent olive processors from investing excess time
and effort into producing dissatisfying products. By integrating NIR
into an industrial process, processors are able to obtain information
in sufficient time to make any adjustments to the process. This is
made possible by the near instantaneous analysis of the sample by
NIR.

Although NIR has been suggested as an alternative methodology
for moisture and fat determinations of olive fruit,2−9 the reliability of NIR to displace
the usage of traditional analytical techniques has yet to be tested.
Furthermore, a standardized method for fat and moisture content determinations
using NIR should be developed to avoid inconsistencies in results.
Even though NIR requires little sample preparation, the analysis is
affected by the physical properties of the sample, such as size and
shape, packing of the sample, surface and color.18 In this study, in addition to different cultivars and harvesting
time points, the particle size of the olive paste will be taken into
consideration to observe the relationship between crushing degree
and precision of NIR to provide fat and moisture contents of the intact
olives. By understanding the relationship between the physical properties
of the sample and NIR, actions can be taken to ameliorate fat and
moisture content determinations using NIR.

The crushing profile
of the fruit may impact the results obtained by NIR due to the parameters
that involves the surface area of the sample.18,19 Although
literature that relates the sample particle size to NIR reflectance
spectrometry is scarce, the relationship between particle size and
NIR reflectance has been done on powdered substances, like pharmaceuticals.19 Reflection spectrometry is the study of light
reflected from the surface area of the samples rather than the amount
of light transmitted through the sample. The reflectance of the samples
is dependent on the concentration, absorptivity, and the scattering
coefficient according to the Kubelka–Munk theory. The NIR spectrum
is affected by the chemical composition as well as the physical properties,
such as the particle sizes and surface area.18,19 Therefore,
it is important to identify the relationship between the characteristics
of the sample and NIR to standardize and optimize olive fat and moisture
measurements using NIR.

There are two main objectives in this
study: (1) to determine the accuracy and precision of NIR screening
on fat and moisture contents to traditional analytical techniques
on four cultivars at different harvesting time points; (2) to investigate
the influence of paste texture on NIR screening using three grid sizes
and two different crushers, as shown in Figure 1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Comparison Study of NIR and Reference Methods
The statistics
of moisture and fat models is detailed in Table 1. The ranges of both the moisture and fat
contents are relatively small, ranging from 15.05 to 24.7 for moisture
content and 50.69–61.03 for fat content. The correlation coefficient
and standard of error are used to show the adequacy of the model.
NIR predictive model obtained from PLS showed satisfactory performance
as demonstrated by the R2 values of 98.0
and 97.8 from the calibration of moisture and fat contents, respectively.
The standard error of prediction (SEP) values of moisture and fat
contents from the validation model are similar to the standard error
of calibration (SEC) values of the calibration model, indicating that
the calibration equation can produce results with great precision.

The regression analysis indicates a good correlation (R2 = 0.995) between the reference method and NIR for moisture
content when the triplicate runs average values are graphed (Figure 2). Additionally,
the 95% confidence intervals for y-intercept and
slope are (−1.983, 1.704) and (0.971, 1.035), respectively.

method and NIR validation are graphed.

Figure 3 shows the
linear regression for the triplicate runs average values of the reference
method and NIR for fat content. The regression analysis yielded a
good correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.995).
The 95% confidence intervals for the y-intercept
are (−0.466, 0.778) and (0.960, 1.025) for the slope.

The correlation of fat content measured with reference method has
shown in other literature to be less satisfactory than moisture content
measured with gravimetry.5,11,20 Cayuela et al. obtained regression models by partial least squares
(PLS) and NIR for the analyses of fat (R2 = 0.86) and moisture content (R2 = 0.91)
with minimal predictive errors.5 Bendini
et al. investigated the feasibility of integrating NIR in industrial
olive mill by collecting the moisture and fat contents of intact olives
using NIR and PLS regression. It is concluded that NIR provided satisfactory
correlation for moisture content, but the fat content predicted by
NIR was poor with R2 value of 0.605.11 Jimenez et al. conducted a similar experiment
using NIR reflectance spectroscopy to measure fat and moisture contents
in intact fruit after treating with a hammer mill crusher and reported
standard errors of 0.811 and 0.928 for fat and moisture contents,
respectively.20 In this study, both fat
and moisture contents demonstrated satisfactory correlation with R2 of 0.995. Since this study included 23 samples
of olives, a future study with more samples should be used to build
a robust model to validate the results found.

2.2 Maturity
Figures 4 and 5 show the changes
in moisture and fat contents (in dry basis) obtained by the reference
method for the four studied cultivars from November 6 to December
11. Moisture content presented an overall decreasing trend with time,
which is consistent with literature.1,21 All cultivars
except for Arbequina showed little changes in moisture content in
the beginning of the study period until December 4 where all four
cultivars demonstrate a drastic decrease in moisture content. Arbequina
began the harvesting season with very little changes (59.8 ±
0.3% on November 6 and 58.8 ± 0.5% on November 13). However,
a significant decrease on November 20 (57.2 ± 1.4%) can be observed.
The moisture content of Arbequina then increased on November 27 (60.1
± 0.2%) and began to decrease similarly to other cultivars with
54.3 ± 0.4% on December 4 and 52.3 ± 0.7% on December 11.
Of all of the cultivars, Koroneiki has the lowest percent moisture
(56.6 ± 0.3%) in the beginning of the harvesting period with
the most dramatic decreasing trend on December 4 (54.3 ± 0.3%).
Unfortunately, the time point on December 11 for Koroneiki is missing.
Arbosana showed the highest moisture content in and throughout the
harvesting period (61.0 ± 0.8, 60.9 ± 0.2, 60.1 ± 0.2,
60.6 ± 0.9, 56.3 ± 0.7% on November 6, 13, 20, 27, and December
4, consecutively) until December 11, where it drastically decreased
to the lowest moisture content of the four cultivars (51.2 ±
0.5%). The moisture content of Chiquitita increased on November 13
(59.5 ± 0.5%) and remained steady until December 4 (54.3 ±
0.3%) where a prominent decreasing trend is observed. The variability
of the moisture content as the fruit matures is not uncommon considering
that moisture content is highly variable across maturation period
as olives tend to absorb more moisture when it is abundant, but release
water when it is drier. The moisture content of the olive fruit is
dependent on cultivars and environmental conditions,21,22 therefore some deviation overtime is expected.

Arbequina, Arbosana, Koroneiki, and Chiquitita cultivars determined
by gravimetry throughout the harvesting season.

Figure 5 Fat contents for Arbequina,
Arbosana, Koroneiki,
and Chiquitita cultivars determined by Soxhlet extraction throughout
the harvesting season.

Fat content
showed an increasing trend with time, again consistent with what has
been shown literature.1,23 The most dramatic increase in
fat content of the four cultivars is observed on December 4. Chiquitita
had little overall changes during the studied time period, though
some decreases earlier in the season and a large increase during November
27 (17.16 ± 0.6%) and December 4 (21.31 ± 0.3%) were observed.
Since its fat content was among the highest at the starting period,
it is possible that the fat content had reached its peak for Chiquitita.
Koroneiki and Arbequina experienced little overall changes during
the period of November 6 to November 27, however, a significant increase
was observed for Arbequina after November 27 (data missing for Koroneiki).
The fat contents for Koroneiki were 18.8 ± 0.1, 18.9 ± 0.6,
18.0 ± 0.2, 18.5 ± 0.2, 21.3 ± 0.3% on November 6,
13, 20, 27, and December 4. Arbosana had the most consistent increasing
trend comparing to other studied cultivars with drastic increasing
fat content on November 13 (16.4 ± 0.3%). The increasing trend
of fat content collected from all four cultivars is parallel to results
found in literature. The accumulation of fat content in olive fruits
is slightly influenced by the maturity as well as the climatic conditions
of the olives.23 Therefore, the overall
increasing trend of fat content in this study is not solely dictated
by the ripeness of the fruit. The inconsistency found during the study
period is an indicator that the climatic conditions of the olive fruits
may have impacted the fat content.

To assess how accuracy changes
with harvest time, a difference in values obtained by the reference
methods and NIR was calculated. All fruits harvested at the same time
point for the reference methods and NIR were averaged to determine
the differences in the mean values, which can be used as a marker
of how closely related is the value predicted by NIR to the reference
methods. The mean differences of both moisture and fat contents are
small, demonstrating mean differences within the range of ±0.2%.
There were no significant trends observed across the study period
for both fat and moisture contents. The standard deviations for both
moisture and fat contents are big; therefore, statistically, there
are no differences in the accuracy of NIR across the study period.

2.3 Cultivars
Moisture content slightly varied among different cultivars. Three
of the four cultivars showed a steady range of moisture content in
the month of November except for Arbequina. Arbosana ranged between
51.2 ± 0.5 and 61.90 ± 0.2%, whereas Koroneiki had range
of 50.7 ± 0.2 and 58.5 ± 0.7%. The moisture content of Chiquitita
was in the range of 51.9 ± 0.4 and 59.6 ± 1.0%. All four
of the cultivars drastically decreased in moisture content in the
beginning of December, reaching a minimum on December 11. Arbequina
had a maximum of 60.17 ± 0.2% and a minimum of 52.3 ± 1.2%.
Different from the other cultivars, Arbequina deviated from the general
decreasing trend for moisture content with a drastic decrease observed
on November 20 (57.2 ± 1.4%), followed by an increase in moisture
content on November 27 (60.1 ± 0.2%), which then continued to
drop for the remaining study period. Considering that there are many
factors that could influence the moisture content of olives, it is
difficult to determine the reason behind the inconsistency observed
for Arbequina. However, it is possible that the moisture content fluctuates
due to external reasons, such as the sensitivity and adaptability
of fruits to the climate.22,23

Fat content of
all four cultivars increased overtime during the study period. The
ranges of fat content obtained by the reference method are as follows:
Arbequina (15.05 ± 0.2 to 24.70 ± 0.6%); Arbosana (16.38
± 0.3 to 22.56 ± 0.8%); Koroneiki (18.02 ± 0.2 to 21.63
± 0.3%); Chiquitita (17.15 ± 0.5 to 21.31 ± 0.3%).
The maximum fat contents of Arbequina and Arbosana were observed on
December 11, whereas the maximum fat contents of Koroneiki and Chiquitita
were observed on December 4. The percent fat for Chiquitita had shown
to decrease on November 11, whereas Arbequina, Arbosana, and Koroneiki
continued to increase. As seen in Figure 3b, the amounts of percent fat for each cultivar
were slightly different in the early stages, and each cultivar had
increased in varying amounts. However, as the fruit matured, the fat
content recovered from each cultivar became greater. The highest increase
in fat content was for Arbequina, which peaked toward the end of our
experiment in mid-December.

The differences between the prediction
provided by NIR and the reference methods for different cultivars
were also calculated. There were no significant differences for both
moisture and fat contents, indicating that the accuracy of NIR does
not vary between cultivars. However, NIR has demonstrated a greater
ability to predict fat content (within the range of −0.05–0.06)
than moisture content (within the range of −0.02–0.11).
The predictions provided by NIR closely represent the reference methods
for fat content, demonstrated with the small mean differences values,
in comparison to moisture content. This differs from previous literature,
as NIR was found to be more effective for moisture content than fat
content.5,11,20 This may be
explained by the difficulty to analyze spectra within the range of
moisture content due to the overlapping of the water fingerprint region.
Two broad peaks around 1440 and 1930 nm, generally caused by water,
may cause complications during NIR analysis.24

2.4 Crushers and Grid
Sizes
Particle size distribution of the sample is a crucial
parameter of NIR reflectance spectrum.18,19 The crushing
profile of the olive fruit has shown to be one of the parameters that
could influence the accuracy of NIR screening.18 The scattering and reflection of the light on different
textures and surface areas of the sample can influence the screening
of NIR.19 Therefore, the effects of the
particle characteristics of the olive paste and crushing method are
taken into account for this experiment.

Table 2 shows the fat and moisture contents of the
different crushing profiles of NIR screening. Some data points have
been eliminated as outliers because the spectra do not match the calibration
spectra closely enough to offer a reliable prediction. The ability
for NIR to identify spectra that are outliers indicate that NIR is
able to distinguish spectra that are widely different from the spectra
provided by the calibration model. Since the calibration model is
built based on the 4 mm hammer mill samples, olive samples crushed
with 6, 8 mm hammer mill and blade crusher were purely blind predictions.
The calibration model was too specific to analyze olive samples crushed
with 6, 8 mm hammer mill and blade crusher due to these spectra being
too different from the spectra that are contained in the calibration.

4 HM, 6 HM, 8 HM represent 4, 6, 8 mm hammer mill and BC represents
blade crusher.

Despite some data points eliminated, trends among 4, 6, 8 mm grid
sizes were observed. Because the used model is based solely on 4 mm
grid size crushed fruits, the fat and moisture contents of 6, 8 mm
grid sizes on the hammer mill and the blade crusher are predictions
made by the NIR calibration model. Olives crushed with 4 mm grid sizes
on the laboratory hammer mill have generally demonstrated higher moisture
content yield in comparison to olives crushed with 8 mm grid. The
diffusion component of reflected energy depends on the physical nature
of the sample because increasing surface area enables more particles
to spread through the sample.19 The Kubelka–Munk
model can be used to describe the importance of light propagation
through an inhomogeneous mixture and a homogenous mixture, which can
create different scatterings of lights and therefore influencing the
NIR result.25 The increasing moisture results
of the NIR with decreasing grid size could partly be explained by
this, but is more likely a consequence of the grid sizes not being
represented in the calibration model. The fat content screened by
NIR showed unexpected results with majority of the samples demonstrating
a lower fat yield in response to 4 mm grid. The inconsistencies observed
for fat content are likely a result of the calibration model having
only 4 mm grid size data. Since a majority of the 8 mm hammer mill
olive paste was predicted as outliers, this is a clear indication
that incorporation of data for each blade size to be analyzed is crucial
for a robust and reliable calibration.

The crushing treatment
of the fruit has proven to influence moisture and fat contents. Inarejos-García
et al. demonstrated that olives crushed with a hammer mill resulted
in higher fat content.26 The authors hypothesized
that a high speed hammer mill may cause a more complete breakage of
fruit tissue due to the more aggressive crushing mechanism.26 In this study, the differences in crushing methods
have shown to be mainly insignificant by analysis of variance (ANOVA)
statistical analysis. Among the small sample size that showed significance
in different crushing methods, the blade crusher is observed to provide
a higher fat and moisture content than a laboratory mill crusher when
NIR is used. This indicates that the crushing methods are one of the
factors, which can affect the NIR measurement. Considering the great
differences in the fat and moisture contents between the hammer mill
and the blade crusher, other parameters, like the speed of rotation
and the temperature of the system, may have impacted the total yield.26,27

3 Conclusions
Near-infrared spectrometry has potential as an alternative method
for fat and moisture determinations in olives. The correlations between
NIR and the reference methods have shown to be very good for both
moisture and fat contents. The sample treatment of the olive fruit,
such as using different grid sizes and crushers, can influence the
results obtained by NIR. Due to the small sample size obtained from
this study, the influences of different particle sizes and crushing
methods on NIR are inconclusive. In this study, olives crushed with
4 mm grid size on the hammer mill resulted in higher moisture content,
but lower fat content in comparison to olives crushed with 8, 6 mm
grid size on the hammer mill and blade crusher. The calibration model
was built using only olives crushed with 4 mm grid size on the hammer
mill. Therefore, this may influence the predictions made for olives
crushed with 6, 8 mm grid sizes on the hammer mill and the blade crusher.
However, due to the good correlation between NIR and the reference
methods, it can be concluded that if the NIR samples were prepared
similarly to the sample used for the calibration model, a more robust
calibration model can be built, providing a more accurate result for
both fat and moisture contents. A calibration model built using different
grid sizes and crushing methods should be integrated to further confirm
this conclusion. Furthermore, it is necessary to conduct cross-lab
ring tests, including larger sample sizes, to further validate and
improve the results found in this study.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Sample Preparation
Four different cultivars
of olives (Arbosana, Arbequina, Chiquitita, and Koroneiki) were harvested
during six time points in 2017: November 6, November 13, November
20, November 27, December 4, and December 11. Unfortunately, the reference
method data on December 11 for Koroneiki are missing. The maturity
indexes of the olive fruits were collected for each time points, as
shown in Table 2.

Olives were crushed in a laboratory scale hammer mill (MC2 Ingeniería
y sistemas S.L., MM-100, Spain) equipped with interchangeable grids
(4, 6, and 8 mm) and a blade crusher (Mori-Tem S.R.L., FRANGITORE
150, Italy), as shown in Figure 1 within 24 h of harvesting.

4.2 Reference Moisture Determination
Olive samples were dried in a convection oven after being crushed
with 4 mm grid size laboratory hammer mill. The percent moisture of
the fruits was determined by gravimetry. The samples were placed in
the oven at 105 °C for 10 h. Dried pastes were then removed from
the oven and cooled in the desiccator prior to weighing.28 The percent moisture content of the sample is
given by eq 1.8 1  

4.3 Reference Fat Determination
After
olives were crushed with 4 mm grid size laboratory hammer mill and
dried in a convention oven, the dried olive paste was manually crushed
with a mortar to increase solvent-solid contact area. Soxhlet extractions
were then performed using 20 g of dried paste. The paste was loaded
in a cellulose extraction thimble, transferred to the Soxhlet apparatus,
and extracted with n-hexane for 6 h. Once the extraction
was finished, samples were placed in a rotary evaporator and oven
at 105 °C for at least 3 h.28 The
dried paste fat content is calculated by eq 2 as shown. 2  

4.4 NIR Instrumentation and Spectral Acquisition
A portable
NIR spectroscopy (Galaxy NIR QuasIR 3000) was used to measure the
fat and moisture contents of wet paste olives. Triplicates of three
different grid sizes (4, 6, 8 mm) from the hammer mill and the blade
crusher were used as samples. The wet olive paste was contained in
a quartz Petri dish with a pathlength of 1 mm such that it covered
the Petri dish completely. The acquisition of spectra was obtained
using a 90 mm diameter glass sample spinner that rotates at a constant
speed to improve the NIR source light exposure to sample. The spectra
were collected in the range of 4000–10 000 wavenumbers
(cm–1). Each spectrum consisted of 60 co-added scans
with a resolution of 8 cm–1. The scans were performed
such that three different scans were averaged by the acquisition software
to generate a single spectrum. Each of the 23 samples was partitioned
into three parts to sample it three times by both near-infrared spectrometry
and by traditional lab analysis.

Multivariate regression partial
least squares (PLS) calibration model was formulated to characterize
spectral variables with olive fat and moisture contents. The PLS calibration
model was built using fruits crushed with 4 mm grid size on the hammer
mill. For building the calibration, the average value of the lab result
was used as the true value for all replicate scans of the sample.
Separate models using QTA Chemometrics software were created for fat
and moisture contents by utilizing approximately 50% of the data sets
for calibration and the remaining 50% for model accuracy testing.
The prediction residuals of the data set reserved for testing were
computed as the difference between the lab value for the trait minus
the PLS model prediction of the trait for each sample in the test
set. The overall prediction error for the data set is referred to
as the standard error of prediction (SEP) and computed as the root-mean-squared
error of the residuals as follows 3  where x is a result computed from the PLS algorithm
applied to sample i, X is the lab
value based on wet chemistry for sample i, and n is the number of samples. The SEP is a measure of performance
for a calibration model based on n tested values in the data set,
which serves as the testing set. The calibration for both fat and
moisture was optimized using the PLS software tool, which tests various
wavelength regions, mathematical preprocessing functions, which are
applied to the spectral data, as well as the number of regression
coefficients used in the model. The models, which produce the lowest
SEP values for the test set, are selected as the most effective models.
For the fat algorithm, the preprocessing was single normal variate
(SNV) standardization of the mean-centered spectra with the regions
of 3996–7000 and 8199–9401 cm–1 used
for the model. For moisture, SNV was also used, and the regions selected
were 4595–5199 and 8199–10 000 cm–1. Although the model was built with only samples from the 4 mm hammer
mill, it was used to predict hammer mill grid sizes of 6, 8 mm and
blade crushed olives to identify whether different crushing methods
provide different results. SEP and SEC were also considered.

4.5 Statistical Analyses of Reference
Method and NIR Spectra
Linear regression was performed on
the average values of the triplicate reference method results and
NIR prediction results to identify the relationship between both methods.
Since dry basis results were obtained from the reference method, results
were transformed to wet basis using the following eq 4. 4  ANOVA was used to determine the impact of different
crushing conditions. Tukey multiple comparisons test was then performed
to assess differences among means.
