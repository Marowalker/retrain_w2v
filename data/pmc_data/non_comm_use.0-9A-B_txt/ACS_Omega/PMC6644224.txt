Carbon nanofoam (CNF) is a highly
porous, amorphous carbon nanomaterial
that can be produced through the interaction of a high-fluence laser
and a carbon-based target material. The morphology and electrical
properties of CNF make it an ideal candidate for supercapacitor applications.
In this paper, we prepare and characterize CNF supercapacitor electrodes
through two different processes, namely, a direct process and a water-transfer
process. We elucidate the influence of the production process on the
microstructural properties of the CNF, as well as the final electrochemical
performance. We show that a change in morphology due to capillary
forces doubles the specific capacitance of the wet-transferred CNF
electrodes.

Introduction
Supercapacitors are electrochemical-energy-storage
devices that
have gained significant attraction in recent years. They have much
promise owing to fast charge times typically associated with dielectric
capacitors (in the seconds), coupled with high energy densities normally
associated with conventional electrochemical batteries. This is achieved
through the formation of an electrical double layer at the interface
between the high-surface-area electrodes and an interacting electrolyte.

Carbon nanomaterials, in particular, are well suited to supercapacitor
applications.1,2 Many allotropes have high electrical
conductivities, as well as high specific surface areas, making them
ideal electrode materials. Moreover, their high porosity allows greater
ion displacement from the electrolyte, greatly enhancing the electrical
double-layer capacitance responsible for the overall performance of
the device.3 Multiple carbon nanomaterials
have been investigated for use in supercapacitor electrodes, including
carbon nanotubes, pristine graphene, and reduced graphene oxide (GO).
These materials are highly structured and require significant processing
to achieve porous structures that maximize the available electrode
surface area. An alternative class of materials are carbon foams,
which are volumetric, amorphous, and highly porous.4,5 The
morphologies vary depending on the synthesis method, but all varieties
of carbon foam have a very high specific surface area up to 1500 m2/g.4 In previous studies, supercapacitor
electrodes based on carbon foams have achieved specific capacitance
up to 330 F/g in aqueous electrolytes, which is highly competitive
with other carbon nanomaterials (typically between 50 and 370 F/g).1,6−10

Carbon nanofoams (CNFs) are a further subclass of carbon foam
formed
during the interaction of laser radiation and a carbon-based target.11−14 The surface morphology of CNFs varies significantly compared to
other carbon foams as it is formed in a diffusion-limited aggregation
manner rather than by increasing the volume of a bulk precursor.14 The CNF consists of a significant amount of
sp2 bonds, making the material conductive.11−13 Among the drawbacks of the CNF are poor mechanical stability and
poor substrate adhesion. Although both factors prevent the use of
CNF electrodes in aqueous electrolytes, they are stable in many organic
electrolyte systems. This has advantages as while aqueous electrolytes
offer low cost and ease of processing, organic electrolytes allow
for a wider potential window and consequently a higher energy density.15

During the preparation of CNFs, the substrate
adhesion is low enough
that the contact with water is able to delaminate the materials. Interestingly,
this phenomenon can be used as a route to transfer the electrode material
from an initial substrate to a target by a water-transfer process.
In this way, the CNF floats on the top of the water subphase and can
subsequently be picked up by withdrawing a submerged substrate from
below. While the material is trapped at the air–water interface,
morphological changes can occur because of capillary forces. This
effect is particularly apparent in materials with a small characteristic
pore size because of the enhancement of the capillary interaction.16

In this paper, we demonstrate the preparation
and characterization
of a CNF-based supercapacitor electrode material through laser processing
of a graphene oxide (GO) target. The prepared CNF is transferred onto
an appropriate substrate by use of a water-transfer process resulting
in a change in the morphology of the foam, which enhances the specific
capacitance of the resulting electrodes by a factor of 2. Using Raman
spectroscopy, we relate the electrochemical performance enhancement
to compression from the capillary forces during the film transfer.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
GO characterization used as a precursor for the CNF. Raman spectroscopy
shows well-defined D and G peaks of the prepared graphene oxide. The
flake size of the synthesized GO was between 500 nm and several μm.
The flake thickness was 0.8 nm.

Figure 1 Characterization of prepared GO: (a) Raman
peaks, (b) scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image to determine the flake size, (c) atomic
force microscopy (AFM) topography, and (d) thickness measurement of
the prepared flake.

Schematics of two fabrication
processes to produce CNF on tin-doped
indium oxide (ITO) substrates are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a illustrates the direct deposition approach, where
the laser is scanned through an ITO-coated substrate above the GO
target. The very first line ablates a small track into the ITO, through
which the laser passes afterwards to hit the target. The laser focus
is kept on the substrate. The carbon clusters diffuse out of the laser-formed
plasma on the target during the reduction of the GO and deposit on
the substrate above. Multiple passes form a thick layer of CNF. Since
this process involves the formation of a carbon plasma, we are able
to prepare CNF with any high-carbon-content material and the feedstock
is not limited to GO.

Figure 2 Fabrication schematics of CNF samples: (a1) ITO on glass
is held
above the GO target, through which the laser is scanned (using a prepatterned
slit in the ITO layer). (a2) A thick layer of CNF is deposited on
the ITO by moving the GO target to feed the deposition process. (b1)
and (b2) show the same deposition process, except a glass substrate
is used. (b3) Glass substrate is immersed in water to detach the CNF.
(b4) CNF is transferred to the final ITO substrate through a reverse
process to (b3).

The water-transfer deposition
approach is shown in Figure 2b. The glass substrate is immersed
in a water bath, whereby the CNF detaches and floats on the water
surface as it is less dense than water. The cohesion of the foam is
strong enough so it does not break apart when immersed. The CNF is
then picked up using an ITO substrate, immersed in the water, and
withdrawn at a shallow angle to the water surface.

Imaging by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 3) shows a significant difference
in morphology between the two deposition methods. The direct-deposited
CNF in Figure 3a has
a low-density, high-porosity structure with a weblike microstructure.
This morphology is typical for a diffusion-limited aggregation formation
process.17 The magnified image in Figure 3b reveals the porous
microstructure formed by the clusters, which are then spun into a
“web” like appearance. The volumetric character of the
CNF did not allow further magnification without charging effects.

images of CNF directly deposited on ITO. (b) Magnified
image of CNF directly deposited on ITO. (c) CNF on ITO after the water-transfer
process of Figure 1b. (d) High-magnification image of water-transferred CNF.

The water-transferred sample (Figure 3c) appears to be much denser,
where the very
fine microstructure of the as-formed CNF has seemingly collapsed,
even though the larger-scale porosity appears to be preserved (Figure 3d). The water transfer
increases the CNF’s conductivity by more than 3 orders of magnitude
to 740 μS/m from 360 nS/m.

Sets of electrodes prepared
by the two methods described in Figure 2 were used to perform
electrochemical measurements. Figure 4a shows cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of the CNF
prepared by direct deposition onto ITO, as well as of water-transferred
films. In both cases, the scan rate was 50 mV/s. All samples exhibit
a near-ideal box like CV character. The two visible peaks at around
−0.3 V originate from the ITO substrate. Figure 4b shows the scan rate dependence
of a water-transferred sample. It is evident that the capacitance
falls with the increased scan rate; however, it remains constant up
to 100 mV/s scan rate. The box like shape is maintained at all of
the scan rates.

mV/s scan rate. (b) Scan rate dependence of the water-transferred
electrode material. (c) Specific capacitance of the two samples as
a function of scan rate. (d) Nyquist plot of spectroscopic impedance
measurements of the electrode materials, showing the blank ITO substrate
as a reference; the inset shows the low-impedance region.

Figure 4c illustrates
the scan rate dependence of the specific capacitance for the samples
shown in Figure 4a.
The direct-deposited CNF shows the lower specific capacitance of around
17.5 F/g, while the water-transferred electrode gives a value of 42
F/g. We see immediately that the specific capacitance of the water-transferred
CNF is more than double the value of the direct-deposited material.
The impedance plot in Figure 4d shows the characteristic steep slope for all of the electrodes
at lower frequencies. The ITO substrate is plotted as a reference
showing the active material behaving as a supercapacitor.

The
cyclic voltammetry measurements of Figure 4a,b show rectangular behavior for the different
samples, suggesting an ideal propagation of charges within the electrodes.18

The rectangular shape of Figure 4b is maintained up to 100 mV/s
scan rate with little
variation of the capacitance. The specific capacitance decreases at
higher scan rates because ion mobility and the substrate’s
resistance limit charge separation in the electrolyte.19 The carbon maintains the rectangular shape at
high scan rates, showing good capacitive behavior. The specific capacitance
of the direct-deposited values measured for the materials presented
are comparable with the work done on CNF systems created in a pulsed
laser deposition process.15

The results
of spectroscopic impedance measurements plotted in Figure 4d highlight the quality
of the CNF supercapacitor electrodes prepared here. The steeper the
angle at low frequencies, indicating non-diffusion-limited accumulation
of electrode surface charge, the closer the system behavior to that
of an ideal supercapacitor.20 The region
exhibiting a 45° angle to the axes is characteristic of Warburg
behavior (see the inset in Figure 4d), which represents the frequency range where ion
diffusion within the electrodes limits the capacitance achievable.
A greater Warburg region indicates that the electrode structure is
inhibiting the diffusion of electrolyte ions.18 The Warburg region in these devices is smaller for the water-transferred
samples than for the direct-deposited ones, showing that the pores
are easily accessible for diffusing ions. The intersection with the x-axis presents the solution and electrode resistance. The
differences lie in the fact that the substrate width was slightly
different in all of the measurements. The sample with a smaller width
showed a higher intersection value.

The increase of specific
capacitance between the direct-deposited
CNF and the water-transferred CNF is due to the change in morphology,
which we believe is induced by capillary forces during the film transfer.16 The water transfer creates a different porous
structure for ion interaction, which results in an increased system
capacitance.21,22 Porosity is a key parameter in
supercapacitor structures as the electric double layer is influenced
by the distribution between macro- (>50 nm), meso- (2–50
nm),
and micropores (0.7–2 nm). Macro- and mesopores enable good
diffusion of ions into the micropores where the surface area is greatly
enhanced to accommodate the ions, whereas solvent molecules penetrate
only as far as the mesopores.21 Besides
the porosity, the film becomes denser, therefore increasing the electrical
contact among the carbon clusters, which increases the conductivity
and the specific capacitance.

To investigate the influence of
the water transfer on the CNF microstructure
further, we turn to Raman spectroscopy. This technique is able to
highlight differences in the bonding character as well as doping or
strain in carbon nanomaterials.23−27 Raman spectra of the CNF directly deposited on a glass substrate
and a CNF sample water transferred from a glass substrate onto a glass
substrate are shown in Figure 5. The spectra are stacked and normalized to the G-peak intensity
for comparison.

Figure 5 Raman spectra of direct-deposited and water-transferred
CNFs onto
a glass substrate.

We note several changes
to the Raman spectra of the water-transferred
material, when compared to the direct-deposited CNF. All three peaks
show a blue shift of three wavenumbers after the water transfer. In
carbon materials, this shift to lower wavenumbers is associated with
a mechanical deformation in the material.23,28−30 The I(D)/I(G) ratio
increases after the water transfer. This is an indication that the
disorder in the carbon increases.31 The
shift of the D′-peak is another indication that the disorder
in the material is increasing.32 The peak
showing up at around 1100 cm–1 originates in the
underlying borosilicate glass substrate.

The increase of specific
capacitance is not only from the change
in morphology but the capillary forces also introduce stress into
the material. During the water transfer, the water enters the porous
CNF and capillary forces start compressing the film. This not only
changes the surface structure but also induces a compressive stress
into the carbon. It is known that compressive forces can enhance the
specific capacitance of carbon films.33 The enhanced specific capacitance therefore originates from two
different components, namely, a change in morphology, making a more
dense film as well as the pores more accessible, and a compressive
stress induced by the capillary forces, which increases the capacitance
further.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated the preparation and
characterization of a
carbon-nanofoam-based supercapacitor electrode material. The material
is prepared through infrared laser treatment of a graphene oxide target,
and may be directly deposited onto a current collector layer (in this
case ITO), or may be transferred from a glass substrate using a water-transfer
process. We observe significant changes to the morphology of the CNF
when transferred in this fashion, including the development of compressive
stress (as characterized using Raman spectroscopy). This effect arises
because of the influence of capillary forces during the transfer process.
The outcome is a significant increase in the specific capacitance
of the CNF, from 17.5 F/g to around 42 F/g.

Methods
Graphene
oxide was prepared using the Hummers method.34,35 The GO was characterized using atomic force microscopy to determine
the flake thickness, SEM to characterize the flake size, and Raman
spectroscopy. For characterization, the GO was spin-coated onto a
silicon substrate. The GO was deposited by drop-casting onto a borosilicate
glass slide. The glass slide was completely covered and left to dry
at 50 °C to hasten the drying process. A second drop-casting
step was added to create a thick layer of GO on the glass slide; it
was again left to dry at 50 °C. The film thickness was aimed
to be more than 200 μm. The GO target was put in an oven and
heated up to 250° in a ramp process for 1.5 h and then left at
room temperature to cool down.

The exact experimental setup
to create the CNF is described elsewhere.17 A brief summary is as follows: the targets were
irradiated with a Multiwave Nd:YAG nanosecond pulsed infrared laser
(set at 10 ns) in ambient conditions with a set fluence of 417 mJ/cm2. To form the CNF on the substrate, it was held stationary
over the target with a small (<1 mm) air gap in between, allowing
the aggregation of the carbon clusters on the substrate.

The
weight of the CNF was measured using a Mettler Toledo microbalance.
Six lines were deposited onto the same substrate to get weight well
outside of the error of the balance. The substrates were measured
before and after the deposition. The measured weight was then divided
by the number of lines deposited.

Samples were imaged with a
Zeiss SIGMA field emission gun scanning
electron microscope (FEG-SEM) using a Zeiss in-lens secondary electron
detector. The FEG-SEM working conditions used were as follows: 1 kV
accelerating voltage, 20 μm aperture, and 2 mm working distance.

Electrochemical measurements were performed with a 3-electrode
configuration using a Gamry 600+ reference potentiostat. The counter
electrode was a platinum wire, and the reference electrode was silver/silver
chloride (Ag/AgCl). The electrolyte used was 0.1 M lithium perchlorate
(LiClO4) in acetonitrile. Cyclic voltammetry measurements
were performed in a range of −1 to +1 V versus Ag/AgCl for
a variety of scan rates from 20 to 5000 mV/s. Impedance spectroscopy
applied a perturbation signal of 10 mV around 0 V at frequencies from
100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.

Raman measurements were carried out using
a Renishaw Invia Microscope.
A 532 nm 50 mW continuous wave laser was used at 10% intensity for
10 s to produce the Raman spectrum. A total of 10 accumulations were
used to enhance the signal.

A Bruker Dimension Icon atomic force
microscope (AFM) was used
in peak force mode to measure the thickness of the GO flakes.
