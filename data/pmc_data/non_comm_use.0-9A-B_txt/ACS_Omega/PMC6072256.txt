Cyanopeptolin-type peptides are cyclic
depsipeptides that commonly
have 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone (Ahp) unit in the molecules. So
far, cyanopeptolin-type peptides have been isolated as protease inhibitors
from a wide variety of cyanobacteria. In the course of screening for
new peptides, a new peptide streptopeptolin, which had the similar
structure to cyanopeptolin, was isolated from the extract of Streptomyces olivochromogenes NBRC 3561. Streptopeptolin
is the first cyanopeptolin-type peptide isolated from actinobacteria.
The structure of streptopeptolin was determined by the analysis of
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and NMR to be cyclic depsipeptide
containing unusual amino acids, Ahp, and N-methyl
tyrosine. As a result of protease inhibition test, streptopeptolin
showed inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin. The whole genome
sequence data of S. olivochromogenes revealed the biosynthetic gene cluster for streptopeptolin, which
encoded a nonribosomal peptide synthetase. We proposed a biosynthetic
pathway of streptopeptolin based on bioinformatics analysis.

Introduction
Cyanobacteria in the
genera Microcystis, Anabaena, Planktothrix, Nostoc, Lyngbya, and Schizothrix are
known to produce a wide variety of bioactive peptides.1 According to the characteristics of chemical structure,
the peptides are classified into the classes of cyanopeptolins, aeruginosins,
microginins, anabaenopeptins, and microviridins.2 Cyanopeptolin-type peptides are cyclic depsipeptides, which
commonly have 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone (Ahp) unit in the molecules.3−8 Cyanopeptolins A–D were first isolated from Microcystis sp. PCC 7806.3 From then, cyanopeptolin-type
peptides have been isolated mostly as protease inhibitors from a wide
variety of cyanobacteria with different names (micropeptins9−11 and aeruginopeptins12 from Microcystis aeruginosa; nostopeptins13 from Nostoc minutum; nostocyclin14 from Nostoc sp.; oscillapeptins15 from Planktothrix agardhii; and somamides A and B16 from a cyanobacterial
assemblage of Lyngbya majuscula and Schizothrix species). Occurrences of cyanopeptolin-type
peptides were also reported in water blooms all over the world;7,8,10,17 however, their function in the natural environment is not clear.
Cyanopeptolin-type peptides have been reported to be biosynthesized
by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system.18−20 The biosynthetic
gene cluster of anabaenopeptilide was reported to contain three NRPS
genes including apdA, apdB, and apdD.21 Nishizawa et al. reported
that a cyanopeptolin class peptide micropeptin K-19 was also biosynthesized
via NRPS system.19 In addition, similar
NRPS genes were reported to be conserved over many cyanobacterial
strains in the genera Planktothrix, Microcystis, and Anabaena.18,19 The cyanopeptolin
analogous peptide named crocapeptin was isolated from the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5 and the biosynthetic
gene cluster of crocapeptin was indicated to include one large NRPS
protein (CpnD) and tailoring enzymes CpnE and CpnF, which convert
a proline residue into Ahp.22,23

Actinomycetes
are soil bacteria, which produce a wide variety of
secondary metabolites including peptides. In actinomycetes, biosynthesis
via NRPS is involved in the production of pharmaceutically important
bioactive peptides such as daptomycin,24 vancomycin,25 and bleomycin.26 In the course of chemical screening for new
peptides using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled
with diode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS), we found a new cyanopeptolin-type peptide streptopeptolin
from Streptomyces olivochromogenes NBRC
3561. S. olivochromogenes is an important
strain that produces xylose isomerase in food industry.27 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report for the isolation of cyanopeptolin-type peptide from actinobacteria.
We found the biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a NRPS for streptopeptolin
from whole genome data of S. olivochromogenes NBRC 3561.28 Here, we describe isolation
and structure determination of streptopeptolin (1) from S. olivochromogenes NBRC 3561.

Results and Discussion
The new peptide streptopeptolin (1) was isolated from
the extract of culture of S. olivochromogenes NBRC 3561. The molecular formula of 1 was established
to be C46H61N9O13 by accurate
ESI-MS analysis, as the ion corresponding to [M + H – H2O]+ (the calculated m/z value, 930.4361) was observed at m/z 930.4395. To determine the structure, the NMR spectra
of 1 including 1H, 13C, DEPT-135,
double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY), total
correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy
(NOESY), rotating-frame overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY), heteronuclear
multiple bond correlation (HMBC), and heteronuclear single quantum
coherence (HSQC) were obtained using the solvent (0.5 mL, MeCN-d3/DMSO-d6; 4:1).
In the 1H NMR spectrum, seven α-protons of amino
acid residues (3.71, 4.18, 4.37, 4.55, 4.62, 4.86, and 4.93 ppm) and
five amide protons (7.21, 7.54, 7.65, 7.69, and 8.19 ppm) were observed.
The assignments of the constituent seven amino acids including Gln1,
Thr2, Gln3, Ahp4, Phe5, N-methyl tyrosine6 (N-Me-Tyr6), and Ala7 were completed using spin system identification
(Figure 1 and Table 1). The construction
of Ahp moiety was accomplished mainly by the TOCSY and HMBC spectra.
The TOCSY spectrum indicated the spin system from amide proton to
H-δ (bold line in Figure 1) in the Ahp unit. The HMBC correlations from H-α (δH
3.71) and H-δ (δH 5.14) to C=O (δC 170.4)
confirmed the cyclic structure in the Ahp unit. The chemical shifts
of Ahp4 in 1 were similar to those of micropeptins. The
two amino acid sequences (Gln1–Thr2–Gln3–Ahp4
and N-Me-Tyr6–Ala7) were determined by HMBC
correlations from α-protons (H-α) and amide protons to
carbonyl carbon (C=O) in adjacent amino acids (arrow in Figure 1). The amide proton
of Phe was not observed, and the HMBC correlations (H-δ of Ahp4/C-α
of Phe5, H-α of Phe5/C-δ of Ahp4, and H-α of Phe5/C=O
of Ahp4) indicated the presence of a tertiary amide in Phe and a connection
between Ahp4 and Phe5. The HMBC correlation from methyl residue (δH
2.74) to C-α (δC 62.4) confirmed the presence of N-Me-Tyr6. The HMBC correlation from methyl residue (δH
2.74) to C=O (δC 171.9) indicated the connection between N-Me-Tyr6 and Phe5. The HMBC correlation from H-β
(δH 5.35) in Thr to C=O (δC 174.8) in Ala indicated
the lactone structure. The TOCSY and DQF-COSY correlations indicated
the 1H spin system between H-3 (δH 6.42) and H-4
(δH 1.72) in methyl-2-butenoic acid (Mba). The HMBC correlations
from H-2-Me (δH 1.79) to C-2 (δC 132.7), C-3 (δC
131.6), and C=O (δC 170.1) confirmed the presence of
methyl-2-butenoic acid. The HMBC correlation from amide proton (δH
7.54) in Gln1 to C=O (δC 170.1) in Mba indicated the
connection between Gln1 and Mba at the N-terminal of the peptide.
The chemical shifts of C-4 (δC 14.2) and C-2-Me (δC 12.8)
in Mba were compared with those of tiglic acid (E-methyl-2-butenoic acid, δC 13.8 and δC 10.9) and angelic
acid (Z-methyl-2-butenoic acid, δC 15.9 and
δC 20.2).29,30 In addition, no correlation in
NOESY and ROESY experiments was observed between H-3 and H-2-Me. The
orientation of the double bond in Mba was assigned as E, considering the similarity of chemical shifts to tiglic acid.

To elucidate the absolute stereochemistries
of Gln, Thr, Ala, Phe,
and N-Me-Tyr in 1, the modified Marfey’s
method was applied.31 The hydrolysate of 1 was derivatized with N-α-(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-leucinamide (l-FDLA). The derivative was subjected
to HPLC analysis to compare with standard amino acid derivatives.
As a result, the stereochemistries of Gln, Thr, Ala, Phe, and N-Me-Tyr in 1 were determined to be L. Regarding
the relative stereochemistry of Ahp, Ahp configuration of 1 was determined to be 3S, 6R or
3R, 6S by ROESY correlations (Figure 2). Considering the
biosynthesis of streptopeptolin by NRPS (described in Results and Discussion), which was similar to that of crocapeptin,
the stereochemistry of Ahp in 1 was proposed to be 3S, 6R.

Figure 2 ROESY correlations in Ahp.

Because cyanopeptolin-type peptides were reported
to have inhibitory
activity against serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin,11,15 the inhibitory activity of 1 was tested against trypsin
and chymotrypsin. As a result, compound 1 inhibited chymotrypsin
with IC50 of 5.0 μg/mL and did not inhibit trypsin
at the concentration of 50 μg/mL. Crystal structures of the
cyanopeptolin-type peptides in a complex with serine proteases indicate
that inhibition is based on a substrate-like binding mode.32,33 Streptopeptolin contains a hydrophobic amino acid Phe, which is
a substrate for chymotrypsin. However, no basic amino acid is present
in the molecule. Considering the inhibition mechanism,32,33 the structural characteristic of 1 may explain the
specific inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin.

Cyanopeptolin-type
peptides are biosynthesized via NRPS pathways.18,19 As we recently conducted whole genome sequencing of S. olivochromogenes NBRC 3561,28 we searched the gene cluster for streptopeptolin synthesis
in the draft genome sequence. The genome encodes four potential NRPS
gene clusters,28 among which three clusters
in BDQI01000038, BDQI01000046, and BDQI01000077 each contain only
two modules at most. The remaining cluster in BDQI01000045 encodes
an NRPS comprising seven modules, as shown in Table S1 and Figure 3, consistent with that of amino acid residues in streptopeptolin
(1). Analysis using anti-SMASH34,35 suggested that substrates of adenylation (A) domains were as follows:
2nd residue (Thr), 4th residue (Pro), 5th residue (Phe), 6th residue
(Tyr), and 7th residue (Val). The 1st and 3rd residues could not be
predicted by the program. Although 7th residue did not match (predicted
residue Val for Ala in 1), the predicted residues at
2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th matched with the determined chemical structure
of streptopeptolin (1), considering Ahp was proposed
to be biosynthesized from Pro.22 The two
genes (spnB and spnC) in the gene
cluster were orthologues to cpnF and cpnE, which possibly convert Pro to Ahp in crocapeptin biosynthesis (Figure 3). The predicted
peptide sequence had Pro at the 4th position from N-terminus, which
corresponded to Ahp residue in the determined structure of streptopeptolin
(1). These similarities with crocapeptin biosynthesis
strongly suggested that the biosynthesis of streptopeptolin (1) was via NRPS. To eliminate the possibility that streptopeptolin
belongs to ribosomally synthesized and post-translatinally modified
peptides, the peptide that had the sequence of Gln–Thr–Gln–Pro–Phe–Tyr–Ala
was searched in the genome of S. olivochromogenes NBRC 3561 using antiSMASH and BLASTp, and no possible peptide was
found by the search. Therefore, we propose the cluster to be responsible
for the synthesis of streptopeptolin.

Figure 3 Proposed biosynthetic pathway of streptopeptolin
(1). Capital letters A, C, MT, and TE represent adenylation,
condensation,
methyltransferase, and thioesterase domains, respectively. Black circle
represents peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain. Locus tags are as
follows: spnA: SO3561_09657, spnB: SO3561_09655, and spnC: SO3561_09654.

Next, we propose a biosynthetic pathway via NRPS
(spnA: SO3561_09657), as shown in Figure 3. Each amino acid as a building
block is converted
to aminoacyl adenylate by each A domain and transferred on the adjacent
peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain within each module to form the
corresponding aminoacyl thioesters. At module 1, Mba is bound to Gln
by the condensation (C) domain. The starter Mba–Gln is then
elongated by the incorporation of Thr, Gln, Pro, Phe, Tyr, and Ala
by successive N-acylation by C domains of modules
from 2 to 7. Tyr loaded onto module 6 undergoes N-methylation by the methyltransferase (MT) domain. The thioesterase
(TE) domain at the C-terminal of the NRPS (SpnA) finally releases
the elongated linear heptapeptidyl thioester from the PCP domain of
module 7 by intermolecular lactonization via the hydroxyl group of
Thr and carboxyl terminus of Ala. The lactonized compound is hydroxylated
by cytochrome P450 (spnB: SO3561_09655, cpnF orthologue) at the Pro residue, which is then transformed to Ahp
residue by cpnE orthologue (spnC: SO3561_09654) as reported in crocapeptin biosynthesis.22 At present, the biosynthetic mechanism of Mba
in streptomycetes is not clear. Tiglic acid is a defensive compound
in certain beetles and biosynthesized from isoleucine via 2-methylbutyric
acid.36,37 In S. olivochromogenes, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SO3561_09667) and/or enoyl-CoA hydratase
(SO3561_09669) may be involved in the formation of double bond in
Mba (Table S1).

Cyanobacterial cyanopeptolin
biosynthetic gene clusters such as mcnA–D encode three or four NRPSs
to form seven modules.18,19 Although the NRPS for streptopeptolin
comprises seven modules and the domain organization is similar to
those for cyanopeptolins, all the modules are present in a single
polypeptide. Our recent database search suggested that many actinomycete
strains such as S. olivochromogenes DSM 40451T, S. aureofaciens ATCC 10762T, S. viridifaciens DSM 40239T, Streptomyces sp. MM5, Streptomyces sp. MM100,38Streptomyces sp. CB03911, Streptomyces sp.
CB02056, Streptomyces sp. CB01249, and Streptomyces sp. CB0246039 harbor multiple NRPSs for
streptopeptolin-like compounds and each NRPS contains seven modules
without exceptions. Although cyanopeptolin and streptopeptolin show
similar structures, the peptide backbones of such compounds are likely
synthesized by a single NRPS in actinomycetes unlike cyanobacteria.
The biosynthetic gene of crocapeptin also includes a single NRPS,
so the biosynthesis of streptopeptolin seems to be similar to that
of crocapeptin.22 In cyanopeptolin biosynthetic
gene clusters, specific domains such as halogenation, sulfotransferase,
and glyceric acid loading domains are often present.18 However, such domains are not observed in actinomycetes.

Conclusions
In this report, we isolated and determined the structure of a cyanopeptolin-type
peptide streptopeptolin from S. olivochromogenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the discovery
of a cyanopeptolin-type peptide from actinomycetes, and we successfully
identified the biosynthetic gene cluster. This study provides useful
information to elucidate distribution, evolution, and biological significance
of the cyanopeptolin-type peptides produced by taxonomically distant
bacteria.

Methods
Bacterial Strains
S. olivochromogenes NBRC 3561 was obtained from the
NBRC culture collection (Biological
Resource Center, National Institute of Technology and Evaluation,
Chiba, Japan).

Isolation of Streptopeptolin
S. olivochromogenes NBRC 3561 was cultured on ISP2
agar medium (2 L) at 30 °C for
5 days. Spores and aerial hyphae were harvested by a steel spatula
after the cultivation. Double volume of methanol was added to the
harvested cell for extraction, followed by filtration using filter
paper (Whatman No. 1, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont,
U.K.). The filtrate was evaporated by a rotary evaporator and the
concentrated extract was subjected to open-column chromatography (styrene–divinylbenzene
resin, CHP-20P, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and eluted
with 10% MeOH, 60% MeOH, and 100% MeOH. The 100% MeOH fraction was
concentrated using a rotary evaporator, subjected to HPLC separation
using an octadecyl-silica (ODS) column (4.6 × 250 mm2, Wakopak Handy ODS, Wako) and an UV detector set at 220 nm, and
eluted by 22% MeCN containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at
the flow rate of 1 mL/min to yield 5.0 mg of 1 (retention
time of 1: 21.8 min).

NMR Experiments
NMR sample was prepared by dissolving 1 in 500 μL
of mix solvent (MeCN-d3/DMSO-d6, 4:1). One-dimensional, 1H, 13C, DEPT-135, and all 2D NMR spectra were obtained
on Bruker Avance 800 spectrometer with quadrature detection following
the previous report.40

MS Experiments
ESI-MS analyses were performed using
a JEOL JMS-T100LP mass spectrometer. For accurate MS analysis, polyethylene
glycol was used as an internal standard.

Modified Marfey’s
Method
The modified Marfey’s
method was applied to 1, following previous report.40 The reagents including N-α-(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-leucinamide (l-FDLA, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,
LTD) and N-α-(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-leucinamide (l-FDLA, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,
LTD, Tokyo, Japan) were used for derivatization. The standard amino
acids including l-Glu, l-Thr, l-allo-Thr, l-Ala, l-Phe, and N-Me-l-Tyr
were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan. The HPLC
analysis was performed for each derivative at a flow rate of 1 mL/min
using solvent A (distilled water containing 0.05% TFA) and solvent
B (MeCN containing 0.05% TFA) with a linear gradient mode from 0 to
70 min, increasing the percentage of solvent B from 25 to 60. The
retention times (min) of l-FDLA- or d-FDLA-derivatized
amino acids in this HPLC condition were as follows; l-Glu-d-FDLA (30.50 min), l-Glu-l-FDLA (28.46 min), l-Ala-d-FDLA (39.58 min), l-Ala-l-FDLA (32.42 min), l-Thr-d-FDLA (32.78 min), l-Thr-l-FDLA (23.72 min), l-allo-Thr-d-FDLA (28.90 min), l-allo-Thr-l-FDLA (25.73 min), l-N-Me-Tyr-d-FDLA (68.15 min), l-N-Me-Tyr-l-FDLA (65.62 min), l-Phe-d-FDLA (56.51 min), and l-Phe-l-FDLA (46.00 min).

Enzyme Inhibitory Assay
The trypsin
inhibition assay
was carried out at 37 °C by incubating 200 μL of trypsin
solution (150 U/mL in 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6) with 120 μL
of assay buffer (0.4 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.6) in the presence of
80 μL of different concentrations of 1 (prepared
in DMSO) or the solvent control. After 10 min incubation, 400 μL
of 1 mM substrate N-α-benzoyl-d, l-arginine-4-nitroanilide (prepared as 100 mM stock solution
in DMSO and further diluted to 1 mM in the buffer 50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.6) was added. The reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance
at 405 nm at 0 and 30 min from the starting time of the reaction.
The chymotrypsin inhibition assay was carried out at 37 °C by
incubating 200 μL of trypsin solution (18 U/mL in 50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.6) with 120 μL of assay buffer (0.4 M Tris–HCl,
pH 7.6) in the presence of 80 μL of different concentrations
of 1 (prepared in DMSO) or the solvent control. After
10 min incubation, 400 μL of 1 mM substrate N-succinyl-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide (2.5 mM in
the buffer 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6) was added. The reaction
was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm at 0 and 30 min
from the starting time of the reaction (Scheme 1).
