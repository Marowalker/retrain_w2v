A series
of aliphatic copolyesters, poly(butylene adipate-co-butylene itaconate) (PBABI), have been synthesized using
melt polycondensation of adipic acid (AA), itaconic acid (IA), 1,4-butanediol
(1,4-BDO), and the tetra-functional group of ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA, 0.1 mol %) to form partially cross-linking density as
novel thermoplastic unsaturated copolyesters in our previous research.
The crystal phase of PBABI copolyesters tended to prefer thermodynamics
in the presence of a small amount of EDTA. The isothermal crystallization
analysis revealed that the PBABI with EDTA exhibited a higher crystallization
rate and a shorter half-time of crystallization than neat PBABI copolyesters.
All of the sizes of spherulite/sheet crystals in the BA/BI = 9/1 are
smaller than at BA/BI = 10/0 with or without a cross-linking agent,
which demonstrated that the morphology behavior tended to form a small
sheet crystal in the presence of 10 mol % IA, which played a dominant
role in determining the average size of the crystal. These results
deepen our understanding of the relationship among the cross-linking
agent, the crystal form, and solidification time in PBABI copolyesters,
making these kinds of polymers applicable to reinforce three-dimensional
(3D) air-permeable polyester-based smart textiles.

Introduction
Aliphatic polyester,
consisting of different lengths of the CH2 group and ester
bonds within the main chain or side chain,
is a semicrystalline polymer and widely used as adhesives, fibers,
films, scaffolds in biodegradable materials, and so on, which exhibits
excellent flexibility in the polymer chain, mechanical properties,
and biodegradability.1−4 Poly(butylene adipate) (PBA) is a typical aliphatic polyester that
has been commercialized by the BASF company.5−9 PBA is a polymorph polyester, and the crystal phases
could be transformed into α-phase, β-phase, and an α/β
complex under heat treatment.10−22 The α-phase of PBA is associated with thermodynamic stability,
while the β-phase is a metastable phase that can be induced
into the α-phase via annealing procedures. The α-phase
of PBA through annealing procedures could drive the transition behavior
of crystal morphology and size, which leads to biodegradability. Gan
et al. adopted thermal annealing procedures to switch the conversion
of α/β-phase crystals, indicating that β-phase crystals
existed below the temperature of 31.8 °C, while α-phase
crystals occurred at temperatures above 29.8 °C. A mixture of
α/β-phase crystals has been observed with the crystallization
temperature around 30 ± 1 °C.10 At that time, the β- to α-phase crystal transformation
has been investigated, observing that the crystal transformation of
PBA takes place at a higher temperature for the annealing operation,
and this transformation in PBA has been proved as a solid–solid
crystal-phase transition process to improve the increase of the thickening
in the size of crystals.11,12 Yang and co-workers
blended poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) with PBA to examine the α/β-phase
crystal transition behavior, signifying that the α-phase crystal
of PBA played a dominant role with the content of PBS below 70 wt
% under the PBS/PBA blend experiment.13 The orientated PBS crystals resulted in excellent nucleation ability
to induce the formation of α-phase PBA crystals in any crystallization
situation.23 Furthermore, a nucleation
agent has been chosen to induce the transformation of the crystallization
behavior between α- and β-phase crystals, such as uracil,14 poly(vinyl alcohol),15 cyanuric acid,16 anodic aluminum oxide,17 anhydrous orotic acid,18 oxalamide derivative,19 sorbitol derivative,21 and so on. Bao and colleagues have modified
PBA with the end-functional H-bonding group, 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UP), revealing that the UP-modified PBAs favored
the formation of the thermally stable α-phase crystal at the
same temperature, as well as lowering and broadening the temperature
range for the β- to α-phase crystal transition of PBA
under heating processes.20 Also, a well-known
unsaturated polyester, poly(butylene itaconate) (PBI), is synthesized
from itaconic acid (IA) and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) via melt polymerization.24 IA has a dicarboxylic group, is a biomassed,
unsaturated, and sustainable material, and has been extensively used
in bio-based UV-cured adhesive resin.25,26 A new aliphatic
copolyester, poly(butylene adipate-co-butylene itaconate)
(PBABI),27 has an unfortunate mechanical
property due to the linear conformation of the molecular chain. Hence,
cross-linking agents were the best choice to form a stereo network
structure to enhance the mechanical and thermal properties of these
kinds of aliphatic copolyesters.28

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is widely utilized as a
chelating agent for the removal of metal ions, adhesives, and antioxidants,
as well as in bioengineering and other fields.29,30 The chemical structure of EDTA has two nitrogen atoms in the center
and four symmetrical −COOH groups, which react with the −OH
group to produce an ester bond. The toughness and elasticity of copolyesters
can be reinforced by copolymerizing with EDTA as a cross-linking agent
to form a network architecture,31 which
plays a role in improving the thermal stability and mechanical strength
of copolyesters.32 As described above,
the aliphatic polyester can form a three-dimensional (3D) network
architecture through copolymerization with tetra-functional cross-linking
agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,28 which have been recognized in a strictly controlled content
to explore the thermal and mechanical properties and the crystallization
behavior in our research.33

Herein,
the crystallization behavior of a series of PBABI copolyesters
with cross-linking agent EDTA was investigated through differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and
polarized light microscopy (PLM) analyses. The 3D architecture was
observed in the tetrahedral structure of EDTA, implying that different
3D networks were formed, to examine the influence of the cross-linking
agent on the crystallization behavior.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 displays
the DSC trace of PBABI copolyesters, without and with EDTA molecules
in the temperature range of −50 to 150 °C. In Figure 1a, the increase of
the IA composition to 10 mol % could reduce the Tc by about 10 °C compared to the added cross-linking
agent at the same BA/BI ratio, suggesting the amount of IA molecules
may restrict the molecular chain packing, making it easy to form an
ordered state. Tc in BA/BI = 10/0 has
a similar trend around 29.5 °C compared to the EDTA system but
shows a slight difference at temperatures between 19.2 and 22.7 °C
when the content of BA/BI is 9/1, and with EDTA, respectively, indicating
that the crystallization behavior was associated with the IA molecule.
The most significant value of ΔHc was detected in the presence of EDTA as a node in both BA/BI = 10/0
and 9/1 systems, implying that the EDTA molecule could reduce the
freedom of the molecular chain to constrain the molecular chain motion.
As can be seen in Figure 1b, the Tm value of PBABI at BA/BI
= 10/1, with and without EDTA, was located in the range of 50.2–50.8
°C; however, ΔHm shows a significant
reduction from 49.2 to 43.1 J g–1, which demonstrated
that EDTA could disturb the chain packing in the crystal state, and
the EDTA molecules preferred to form a tetrahedral conformation, which
reflects a more flexible molecular chain to form a loose and movable
3D network. All of the data are listed in Table 1.

The compared X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PBABI
copolyesters,
with and without EDTA, at BA/BI contents of 10/0 and 9/1 are displayed
in Figure 2. The XRD
patterns of PBABI have similar values of 2θ in terms of BA/BI
= 10/0 and 9/1, suggesting that the existence of the BI unit did not
affect the crystal transformation behavior of the BA unit and was
preferred in the α-crystal. These results were also measured
in poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene itaconate)
copolyesters.34 The XRD peaks in PBABI
at BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1 were measured at the 2θ values of around
21.61, 22.31, and 23.96° for the crystal lattices of (110), (020),
and (021), respectively, which corresponded to the α-phase of
neat PBA.8,22 When EDTA, 0.1 mol % was copolymerized into
BA/BI = 10/0 copolyesters, the β-phase at 2θ = 21.31°
appeared slightly and was associated with the (110) crystal lattice.
Furthermore, the intensity of the XRD pattern increased with the presence
of IA, implying that the metastable β-phase could be induced
with an increase of the IA content, but all of the thermodynamic stable
α-phase peaks still existed and played a dominant role in the
crystallization zone. Furthermore, it is interesting that the majority
of crystallization behavior was transformed into an α/β
complex to form small sheet crystals when the EDTA was copolymerized
into both BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1. This is due to the fact that the partial
cross-linking occurring due to the EDTA molecule could hinder the
molecular chain to stack well into noncompleted sheet crystals instead
of the integrated ordered state to grow up to spherulite. Actually,
PBABI is a linear aliphatic copolyester and the molecular chain tends
to be more flexible. Hence, the molecular chain prefers to form a
stable crystal α-phase without EDTA to limit the chain stretching
and packing. The geometrical structure of EDTA within the PBABI copolyester
was represented in tetrahedral steric conformation, indicating that
the main-chain rotation exhibited a semirigid property with the EDTA
molecule as a node.

contents
of BA/BI.

DSC was adopted to measure the
exothermic heat during polymer chain
stacking into an ordered state to form a crystallization regime, which
could be well determined using Avrami models,34−40 and the detailed procedures have been established in our laboratory.41,42 The evolution of crystallinity is linearly proportional to the evolution
of heat released during the crystallization, and the relative degree
of crystallinity, Xt (%), can be obtained
according to the following equation 1   2   3  where dHc represents
the enthalpy of crystallization at the target temperature during the
time interval dt and is measured via DSC. The integral
limits of t and ∞ denote the time of occurrence
of crystallization and the end of the crystallization procedure, respectively.

The isothermal crystallization behavior of PBABI, with and without
EDTA, was investigated in the temperature ranges of 26–42 and
18–26 °C for BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1, respectively (see Figure 3). The curves indicated
that PBABI at a ratio of 10/0 is faster than that at 9/1, even with
EDTA, due to the frustration of the IA molecule. The crystallization
rate of PBABI copolyesters with EDTA was found to be faster than that
of neat copolyester in both of PBABI = 10/0 and 9/1 under the same
temperature, implying that the EDTA molecule could enhance the crystallization
rate of the PBABI copolyester compared to neat PBABI copolyesters.
This is due to the three-dimensional architecture that could be formed
into a tetrahedral structure,28 which exhibited
the semirigid property to promote the chain motion near the cross-linking
spot.

results were plotted with log(−ln(1 – Xt (%))) as a function of log(t) at Xt (%) in the range of 20–80%
and were well fitted by the Avrami equation at various temperatures.
All of the Avrami parameters, n and K, were linearly regressed to obtain from the slopes and intercepts
of the curve for PBABI copolyesters at various temperatures. The half-time
and growth rate were also calculated, and all of the detailed data
are summarized in Table 2. 4   5

Avrami parameters including “n”
and “K” are associated with the Avrami
exponent and crystallization constant, which are dependent on the
growth geometry of nucleation and the shape of the growing crystal
and could be obtained from the plot of log[−ln(1 – Xt (%))] as a function of log(t) through linear regression with the slope and intercept
in the dimensionless unit in min–n, respectively. As can be seen, the values of n are
located between 2 and 3 for PBABI copolymers with EDTA in the target
range of temperatures. First, the effect of IA without any cross-linking
agent was compared at BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1 with averaged n values of 2.38 and 2.13 in the temperature range of 26–42
°C, respectively, and demonstrated that the presence of IA could
lower the crystal formation and decrease the crystallization rate
to form a sheet crystal. Then, a different cross-linking agent with
BA/BI = 10/0 was compared, and the averaged values of n were calculated to be 2.38 and 2.66 without and with EDTA, respectively,
implying a better crystallization behavior with EDTA than neat copolyester,
which is caused by the tetrahedral 3D architecture with a semirigid
chain conformation. Moreover, the crystallization rate K at BA/BI = 10/0 with EDTA was larger than that of neat copolyester
as a function of temperature even in a cluster of BA/BI = 9/1 experimentally.
Furthermore, the n and K values
have a similar trend at BA/BI = 9/1 and BA/BI = 10/0, revealing that
EDTA plays a significant role in the crystallization rate and morphology
even inside the IA molecule. The crystals could be disrupted to form
small sheet crystals when both IA and EDTA were copolymerized into
the PBABI copolyester. In addition, a significant amount of the IA
molecule plays a considerable role in determining the deviation of
crystals. t1/2 and G exhibited
a faster crystallization rate in the presence of EDTA than in the
neat copolyester at the same temperature, indicating that the crystallization
rate could be improved in the presence of EDTA.

Figure 5 displays
the growth rate of crystallization at different temperatures. The
growth curve almost overlapped at BA/BI = 10/0 and with EDTA but shows
a slight change at a lower temperature due to the supercooling degree,
which suggested that the growth rate was not dependent on the existence
of EDTA. When 10 mol % of IA was added, the curve of the growth rate
was separated dramatically at a higher supercooling condition and
also had a sequencing of EDTA to a neat copolyester. This observation
could also give evidence that a higher crystallization growth rate
was obtained when EDTA existed as a semirigid node to lower the chain
movement, which caused the molecular chain to prefer sheet crystals. 6  

Figure 5 Growth
rate of crystallization (G, min–1) as a function of temperature for PBABI copolyesters with EDTA at
different contents of BA/BI.

The DSC trace of the heating process after the isothermal experiment
for PBABI copolyesters and with EDTA at different BA/BI contents is
exhibited in Figure S1. The Hoffman–Week
equation was implemented to obtain the equilibrium melting point (Tm0), and the results are displayed in Figure 6. All of the Tm0 and thickening
coefficient (γ) through the slope of the curve are summarized
in Table 3. The Tm0 values were revealed in the temperature ranges of 57.12–57.14
and 53.62–51.74 °C for BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1 copolyesters,
respectively. The values of γ were located around 4.69–4.06
and 3.27–3.08 for BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1 copolyesters, respectively,
indicating that the cross-linking agent may raise the limitation in
the growth of the crystal to obtain a smaller thickness of the crystal
regime. In the literature survey,11 the Tm0 values of PBA in α- and β-crystals were represented
around 64 and 54 °C, implying that the α- and β-crystals
coexisted in the presence of the cross-linking agent and was also
demonstrated in our XRD results in Figure 2. The PBA in the α-crystal was in a
stable thermodynamic phase, whereas the β-crystal was in a metastable
phase, indicating that the crystals of PBABI copolyesters tended to
form α–β complex crystals coexisting in the presence
of EDTA and IA.

squares and filled red circles represent neat BA/BI and with EDTA,
respectively. The extrapolation method was performed to obtain the
equilibrium melting point (Tm0).

Additionally, as shown in Figure 7, the activation
energy (Ea) could be obtained through
the Arrhenius equation plot and is tabulated
in Table 3. The lower
values of Ea were found individually without
adding EDTA in both BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1 copolyesters, implying that
the PBABI copolyesters exhibited a higher heat sensitivity when EDTA
was present. From the point of view of thickening coefficient (γ),
the value of γ decreased with increasing content of IA and EDTA,
indicating that the comonomer and cross-linking agent could hinder
the chain packing to lower the thickness of the crystal regime. 7

BA/BI and with EDTA, respectively. The curve was regressed to obtain
the slope for activation energy.

To the best of our knowledge, the polymer crystallization pathway
includes the nucleation and growth mechanism; hence, the second nucleation
theory of Lauritzen–Hoffman was performed to investigate the
kinetics of initial crystal growth,43,44 where the
crystal grows gradually when the nucleus passes through the activation
energy of nucleation. The growth behavior could be analyzed through
a linear regression to realize the relationship between the growth
rate of crystal and temperature, and the formula can be described
as follows 8   9  where G0 is the
pre-exponential factor, U* is the activation energy
of chain movement, Kg is the activation
energy of nucleation, R is the gas constant, Tc is the crystallization temperature, T∞ is defined as Tg – 30 K, ΔT is the degree of
supercooling (ΔT = Tm0 – Tc), Tm0 is the equilibrium temperature, f is the modified factor (f = 2 Tc/(Tm0 + Tc)), C1 = 4120 cal mol–1, and C2 = 51.6 K. G0 is
associated with chain flexibility and molecular chain regularity.
The growth rate, G, is correlated to the diffusion
and molecular chain mobility in the crystal regime and was defined
in the first exponent term. The second exponent term is related to
the second nucleation rate. When the nucleus was formed, the molecular
chains tend to pack well to generate a new surface to grow continually.
The mechanism of growth rate is also affected by the degree of supercooling,
which consisted of three regimes. Regimes I, II, and III were observed
in high, medium, and low supercooling degrees, respectively, and the
crystallization behavior was controlled by nucleation alone, both
nucleation and growth, and growth alone. The Lauritzen–Hoffman
plot of ln(G) + U/RTc – T∞ vs 1/(TcΔTf) for
PBABI copolyesters, with and without EDTA, at different contents of
BA/BI is displayed in Figure 8, exhibiting a two-stage discontinuous transition of regimes
III and II obtained and fitted to the slope to gain the nucleation
constant (Kg), implying the two temperature
regimes of the crystallization growth mechanism. The transition temperatures
of regime II → III were obtained to be 308.15 and 308.82 K
for BA/BI = 10/0 without and with EDTA and 301.05 and 301.37 K for
BA/BI = 9/1 without and with EDTA, respectively. All of the obtained
data are listed in Table 4. The obtained Kg(III)/Kg(II) in our research was calculated in the
range of 2.05–2.49 for PBABI copolyesters, with and without
EDTA at different contents of BA/BI, and the results were approximately
equal to the theoretical value of Kg(III)/Kg(II) of 2.43,45,46

The morphologies of PBABI copolyesters, with and without
EDTA at
different contents of BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1 are revealed in Figure 9. All of the isothermal
crystallization of PBABI copolyesters was investigated under a hot-stage
and cooling system PLM. The sample was melted at 80 °C, held
for 5 min, and then cooled quickly at a rate of 150 °C min–1 to target observation temperatures. The PLM images
for BA/BI =10/0 at different temperatures are shown in Figure 9a and displayed in the spherulite
to sheet crystals when the supercooling degree increased. In the literature
survey, PBA (BA/BI = 10/0) was observed in spherulite with lowering
molecular weight from 3000 to 7000 g mol–1.47 The PLM images were shown in a similar trend
for PBABI copolyesters, demonstrating that the morphology tends to
sheet crystals with the existence of IA and EDTA molecules, respectively,
and are shown in Figure 9b–d. However, smaller sheet crystals were observed when IA
was copolymerized even with or without EDTA. The sheet crystals are
exhibited with EDTA inside in both BA/BI = 10/0 and 9/1 at setting
temperatures. For the overall compared observation, the spherulite
in α-phase was observed at a higher temperature of 38–42
°C under a larger degree of supercooling. On the contrary, the
crystal size was decreased with a decrease of temperature under larger
supercooling. When the lower temperature of 26–30 °C was
achieved, the size of the α/β complex becomes more extensive
and more apparent in sheet crystals. From the literature, the α-
and β-form crystals were induced at higher and lower temperature
requirements, respectively. When the temperature was decreased to
30 °C or below, the crystals grew very fast and immediately indicated
that these kinds of crystals tend to form metastable crystals of the
β-form in a small sheet shape due to the formation of more nucleation
sites. The increase of the IA concentration within PBABI copolyester
resulted in sheetlike crystals that grew with a higher stacking density
(Figure 9c). This observation
suggested that IA served as a nucleation site, which provides other
free surfaces to facilitate the nucleation of PBA to achieve heterogeneous
crystallization. When the BA/BI = 10/0 copolyesters were copolymerized
with EDTA (Figure 9b), the spherulite was obtained at 38–42 °C to pack into
α-crystals (see Figure 2). This is due to the effect of chain flexibility in the semirigid
conformation for the EDTA inside, which could induce the occurrence
of phase transition. Furthermore, all of the size of sheet crystals
in BA/BI = 9/1 is smaller than that in BA/BI = 10/0 even with or without
EDTA existed, implying that the crystallization behavior tended to
form sheet crystals in the presence of IA, which played a dominant
role in determining the size and type of crystals.

= 10/0 with EDTA, (c) BA/BI = 9/1, and (d) BA/BI = 9/1 with EDTA at
different temperatures. The scale bar is 10 μm.

Conclusions
The crystallization behavior of the PBABI copolyesters
was studied
with EDTA, observing that the thermodynamical α- and metastable
β-form crystals coexisted in the presence of IA and EDTA molecules.
The EDTA molecules preferred to form a tetrahedral conformation, which
reflects a more flexible molecular chain to form a loose and movable
3D network to increase the crystallinity. The half-time and growth
rate have a sequence with EDTA to neat copolyester at the same temperature,
indicating that the crystallization behavior could be improved in
the presence of EDTA. Tm0 has been revealed in temperature ranges
of 57.12–57.14 and 53.62–51.74 °C for BA/BI = 10/0
and 9/1 copolyesters, respectively. The values of γ were located
around 4.69–4.06 and 3.27–3.08 for BA/BI = 10/0 and
9/1 copolyesters, respectively, indicating the EDTA may raise the
limitation in the growth of crystal to obtain the smaller thickness
of crystal regime. The transition temperatures of regime II →
III were obtained as 308.15 and 308.82 °C for BA/BI = 10/0 without
and with EDTA and 301.05 and 301.37 °C for BA/BI = 9/1 without
and with EDTA, respectively. A relatively larger spherulite in the
α-phase was observed at a higher temperature of 38–42
°C due to a more significant degree of supercooling. Thus, the
present study demonstrated the type of crystals could be controlled
by adding the tetra-functional group of the EDTA molecule, taking
the advantages of the PBABI copolyesters to control the solidification
time in 3D smart textile applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Adipic acid (AA, 99.8%) was obtained from
Asahi Kasei Corporation. Itaconic acid (IA, 99%) and 1,4-butanediol
(1,4-BDO, 99%) were supplied from the First Chemical Corporation (Taiwan).
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 98%) was obtained from Vetec.
4-Methoxyphenol (99%) and titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OBu)4, 97%) were acquired from Aldrich. Dibutyltin
dilaurate (DBTDL, 95%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. All of the chemicals
were implemented by traditional bulk polymerization without any purification.

Synthesis of PBABI Copolyesters with EDTA
PBABI copolyesters
were copolymerized via bulk polymerization, consisting of AA and IA
esterified with 1,4-BDO, 4-methoxyphenol as an inhibitor of C=C
of IA, DBTDL, and Ti(OBu)4 as the
co-catalyst and EDTA as a cross-linking agent under a 2 L steel reactor.
All detailed data of the synthesis, characteristics, and thermal and
mechanical properties have been published in our previous study.28 EDTA has four carboxylic functional groups,
and it has a significant interesting role to discuss in isothermal
crystallization kinetics.

Measurement
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC) and Isothermal Crystallization
Process
DSC (Hitachi High Tech., DSC-7000, Japan) was adopted
to examine the thermal properties, including melting temperature (Tm), crystalline temperature (Tc), melting enthalpy (ΔHm), and crystalline enthalpy (ΔHc) of the PBABI copolyesters. For each experiment, the PBABI copolyesters
were detected from −50 to 150 °C at a heating rate of
10 °C min–1 and kept at 150 °C for 10
min to avoid thermal history for further analysis. Then, these PBABI
copolyesters were cooled to −50 °C at a cooling rate of
10 °C min–1 for the first cycle. After that,
the second cycle of the heating procedure was performed from −50
to 150 °C at the same heating rate of 10 °C min–1 to inspect the melting point. Tc and Tm of the PBABI copolyesters were determined
from the maximum exothermic peak and endothermic peak through the
first cycle cooling and second cycle heating processes, respectively.
All of the DSC measurements were conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere
with aluminum pans.

The DSC experiments of the isothermal crystallization
process of a PBABI copolyester sample were performed in two stages:
(1) the sample was heated to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1 and kept for 5 min to remove thermal history, and
(2) the sample was cooled at a rate of 20 °C min–1 to the given Tc and then held for 60
min. The given temperature range of Tc was set at 26–42 and 18–34 °C for BA/BI = 10/0
and 9/1, respectively.

Intrinsic Viscosity (I.V.)
The PBABI
copolyesters (1.0
g dL–1) were dissolved in a mixture of phenol and
tetrachloroethane, 50/50 wt %, and measured using an Ubbelodhe viscometer
at 25 ± 0.05 °C. The I.V. values for PBABI copolyesters
with EDTA at different contents of BA/BI are tabulated in Table 1.

X-ray Diffraction
(XRD)
The PBABI copolyesters were
prepared as a film type via hot-pressure mechanics, and the XRD pattern
of the PBABI film was verified in the 2θ range of 10–40°
with a scanning speed of 0.2° min–1 by a Malvern
PANalytical X’Pert3 powder diffractometer (Malvern,
U.K.) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm).

Polarizing
Light Microscope (PLM)
The crystal morphology
of PBABI copolyesters under isothermal crystallization was considered
using a polarizing light microscope (PLM) (Nikon, ECLIPSE LV100N POL)
equipped with a Linkam THMS Examina/FTIR600 heating stage, a Linkam
ECP water cooling control unit, and a Nikon camera with the NIS Elements
imaging software. For the crystallization behavior experiment, the
operation conditions related to the results of DSC measurements, i.e.,
the PBABI copolyesters, were initially 80 °C for 5 min at a heating
rate of 150 °C min–1, then a rapid cooling
to the target crystallization temperature at a cooling rate of 150
°C min–1, and finally, holding at a set temperature
for an hour to observe the crystallization growth. All of the crystallization
processes were recorded as a video file and captured as an image.
