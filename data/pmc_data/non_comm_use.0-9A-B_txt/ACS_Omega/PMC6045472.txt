Although a range
of pharmacologically active compounds has been
obtained from the mycelium and fruiting bodies of Ganoderma
lucidum, the biological properties of the alkaloids
present in this functional food remain unknown. Herein, we report
total syntheses of lucidimines B and C, key members of the first family
of alkaloids isolated from G. lucidum, and the evaluation of these synthetically derived materials as
antioxidants and antiproliferative agents. Lucidimine B proved to
be a better antioxidant than congener C. Similarly, lucidimine B exhibited
antiproliferative properties toward MCF-7 cells (an EC50 value of 0.27 ± 0.02 μmol/mL), whereas lucidimine C was
inactive. The former alkaloid arrested the MCF-7 cell cycle in the
S phase by inducing DNA fragmentation, hence reducing the mitochondrial
membrane potential. This work thus demonstrates, for the first time,
that the alkaloidal constituents derived from G. lucidum are biologically active and may, therefore, contribute to the beneficial
health claims made for this nutraceutical.

Introduction
In “new-age”
agriculture, functional foods are not
just intended to satisfy hunger and provide nutrition. They should
also prevent diseases and improve physical and mental well-being.1−4 Such functional foods must contain nutraceuticals, viz., bioactive
components that provide the desired functional properties.5 Ideally, nutraceuticals should be pharmaceutical-grade
(and standardized) compounds, which are considered to be a natural
component of the food, which provides (purportedly, at least) extra
health benefits as well, of course, as contributes to the basic nutritional
value of the food in question.6−8 Numerous mushrooms have been fundamental
components of traditional
medicines for centuries. They have been seen as the source of “miracle”
cures as well as perceived as having general health-promoting benefits.9−12 Among them, Ganoderma lucidum, popularly
known as Lingzhi in China, Reishi in Japan, and Yeongji in South Korea,
is recognized as an important medicinal mushroom, even being referred
to as the “Mushroom of Immortality”.13 Its pharmacological and nutraceutical applications can
be traced back nearly two thousand years.14G. lucidum has been used extensively
in Asia to improve well-being and to promote general good health14 as well as employed, alone or in tandem with
other treatments, in modern Western medicine to slow the proliferation
of certain cancers or to ameliorate the often harsh side effects associated
with chemotherapeutic regimes.15−17 Recently, this nutraceutical
has seen increasing applications in the prevention and/or treatment
of a range of diseases including obesity, bronchitis, insomnia, anorexia,
dizziness, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, allergies, hepatitis, immunological
disorders, and cancer.16−20 Because of its various benefits (perceived and real), G. lucidum is cultured on an industrial scale in
a number of Asian countries, particularly China, Japan, and South
Korea. As a consequence, numerous G. lucidum-derived products have emerged globally in the form of powders, teas,
and nutraceuticals.21

Diverse groups
of chemical compounds with pharmacological activities
have been isolated from the mycelium and fruiting bodies of G. lucidum. These include triterpenoids, polysaccharides,
steroids, fatty acids, amino acids, nucleosides, proteins, and alkaloids.22 The triterpenoids and polysaccharides of G. lucidum have attracted considerable attention
because of their high content in the fungus, diverse structures, and
significant bioactivities.23−30 In general, then, the active triterpenoids inhibit cancer cell proliferation
and metastasis, whereas the polysaccharides function as immunomodulators
and/or antioxidants.17,31−34 In contrast, the distribution
of alkaloids within G. lucidum and
their associated biological properties are much less well-documented,
even if such compounds obtained from other genera of Ganoderma, such
as ganoines I and II from Ganoderma capense,35 sinensines from Ganoderma
sinense,36,37 and ganocochlearines
C–I from Ganoderma cochlear,38 have been described in detail. To date, only
four alkaloids, namely, the polycyclic lucidimine A (1), lucidimine B (2), lucidimine C (3),
and lucidimine D (4) (Figure 1), have been isolated from the methanol extracts
of the fruiting bodies of G. lucidum,39 and their structures were proposed
on the basis of various spectroscopic analyses, particularly those
involving 1H and 13C NMR studies. All of the
four members possess a cyclopenta[c]pyridine skeleton
that is attached to a 1,2,4-trisubstituted phenyl group with variations
at the substituents on C-6, 7, 10 as well as the oxygen bridge positions
(see Figure 1 for numbering).
In a more recent work, lucidimines A (1) and B (2) were also isolated from Ganoderma calidophilum, a rare wild fungi of Ganoderma family, though under different names
(ganocalicines A and B).40

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
lucidimines A–D.

Because the number and types of commercially available products
derived from G. lucidum are increasing
dramatically, consumers are now all the more discerning and seeking
proof of the claimed health benefits. As such, the identification
and comprehensive biological evaluation of the full complement of
chemical constituents of this nutraceutical is assuming greater urgency.21 Furthermore, scientifically acquired information
is needed to meet the increasingly stringent regulatory requirements
related to health claims surrounding nutraceutical products. As a
consequence, the detailed biological evaluation of the lucidimines
is becoming an increasingly important matter and one that cannot be
readily addressed through the isolation of these materials from the
natural source. Indeed, a combination of medium-pressure liquid chromatography,
Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, and multiple prep-HPLC separations
was required in the original isolation, which led to miniscule amounts
(0.5–3.5 mg) of lucidimines A–D, which precluded any
significant evaluation of their biological properties. In principle,
chemical synthesis offers a solution to this challenge, which is made
all the more appealing because of their novel molecular architectures
that embody the rare cyclopenta[c]pyridine substructure.
Herein, we report the first total syntheses of lucidimines B and C
by a pathway that allows for their preliminary (and revealing) biological
evaluation.

Results and Discussion
Total Syntheses of Lucidimines B (2) and C (3)
Scheme 1 summarizes the preparation of lucidimines
B (2) and C (3), which started with the
condensation of
commercially available cyclopentanone 5 with malononitrile
under solvent-free conditions,41 to give
compound 7 (89%). Treatment of 7 with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA)
in the presence of a substoichiometric amount of acetic anhydride
yielded the enamine 8, which was then subjected to Pinner
conditions42 to provide the 2-bromonicotinonitrile 9 in 85% yield (over two steps). The resulting compound was
then engaged in a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction with
(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)boronic acid 10 to afford diaryl 11 (83%). The nitrile of the latter compound was hydrolyzed
to carboxylic acid 12 (90%). In a pivotal step, when
acid 12 was treated with three equivalents of BBr3 in dichloromethane followed by quenching with methanol, both
of the methyl groups were removed, followed by a spontaneous lactone
formation, resulting in compound 13 (58%). On exposure
to NaBH4 and BF3·OEt2,43 the lactone 13 was reduced to the
target compound 2 (53%); this relatively lower yield
could be attributed to the acid/base workup required to remove the
impurities. The structure of compound 3 differs from
that of compound 2 only at the pyran ring, where it possesses
an acetal at C-10, which, we envisaged, could be derived from an aldehyde.
However, reduction of nitrile 11 to the corresponding
aldehyde was not successful, meaning that the aldehyde functional
group needed to be installed in the early stages of the synthesis.
An initial diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAl-H) reduction of the nitrile 9 yielded an aldehyde 14 (87%), which was then
subjected to Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction with (2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)boronic
acid 10 to afford diaryl 15 (80%). Finally,
compound 15 was treated with three equivalents of BBr3 in dichloromethane, to afford a hemiacetal intermediate,
which was then submitted to a p-TsOH-catalyzed acetal
formation process in methanol, thereby providing the final product 3 (53% in two steps). All spectroscopic data acquired on compounds 2 and 3 matched with those reported39 for lucidimines B and C (see Tables 1 and 2). Using these exact protocols, gram scales of lucidimines B and
C were prepared with high purities (97 and 95%, respectively, as indicated
by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry), which allowed
further biological evaluations to be performed.

Antioxidant
Activity
Generally, polysaccharides and
triterpenoids identified from G. lucidum were regarded as the main bioactive substances. In recent years,
however, the polysaccharides from this nutraceutical have been believed
to function as immunomodulators or antioxidants. To reveal the potential
pharmacological properties of the recently reported alkaloids, three
accepted evaluation methods were applied to explore their antioxidant
abilities. Of these, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)
hydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assays are quick and sensitive,44 whereas the peroxyl radical scavenging capacity
(PSC) method is reliable, rapid, and precise.45 The EC50 values for DPPH radical scavenging activities
of lucidimines B and C were 1.24 ± 0.12 and 11.69 ± 1.81
μmol/mL, respectively; meanwhile, the EC50 values
obtained from the ABTS assay were 0.19 ± 0.003 and 0.38 ±
0.003 μmol/mL, respectively. The results demonstrated that lucidimine
B possessed better antioxidant activity than that observed for lucidimine
C. Peroxyl radicals generated by the degradation of 2,2′-azobis-amidinopropane
(AAPH) are capable of oxidizing nonfluorescent dichlorofluorescein
(DCFH) to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The PSC method incorporates
dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as a probe to monitor reactions
and was applied to further determine the antioxidant potencies of
the two alkaloids. The capacities of lucidimines B and C to scavenge
peroxyl radicals were summarized on the basis of the variation of
DCF fluorescence during the reaction. As shown in Figure 2 A,B, lucidimines B and C decreased
the fluorescence as the concentrations increased, indicating that
lucidimines B and C had antioxidant activity. The capacity of lucidimines
B and C to scavenge peroxyl radicals was summarized on the basis of
the variation of DCF fluorescence during the reaction. The PSC values
of lucidimines B and C were 175.32 ± 11.74 μmol vitamin
C equiv/g and 35.93 ± 13.60 μmol vitamin C equiv/g, respectively.
The same tendency was also found in the DPPH and ABTS assays, which
clearly indicated that lucidimine B possessed better antioxidant potency
than lucidimine C.

Antiproliferation in Human Breast Cancer
Cells
It is
believed that the antiproliferative properties of G.
lucidum largely rely on its diversified chemical constituents.46 Numerous studies have demonstrated that the
bioactive components from crude extracts of either spores or fruiting
bodies of G. lucidum are cytotoxic
to a range of cancer cell lines including human hepatoma PLC/PRF/5
and KB,47 human breast cancer MDA-MB-231,48,49 human breast cancer MCF-7,49,50 human prostate cancer
PC-3,51 human cervix uteri tumor HeLa,52 and low-grade bladder cancer MTC-11.53 Because the lucidimines were isolated from the
methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of G. lucidum and the same alcoholic extracts were reported48−50 to have antiproliferative
activity toward human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, the cytotoxicity
of lucidimines B and C against the two human breast cancer cells was
evaluated. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells are two characteristic feature cells associated with estrogen
dependence and estrogen independence, respectively.54 Both lucidimines B and C showed no significant antiproliferative
effects toward the estrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 cell line. Nevertheless,
lucidimine B (EC50 0.27 ± 0.02 μmol/mL) was
more cytotoxic to MCF-7 than lucidimine C (EC50 > 1.86
μmol/mL) in a dose-dependent manner. On the basis of the preliminary
results, MCF-7 cells were selected as the target for in-depth exploration
of the antiproliferative mechanism of lucidimine B.

Cell Cycle
Arrest
Cell cycle plays an important role
in cell growth and cell proliferation. During cellular proliferation,
the cells cycle through four phases leading to cell division: G1 gap,
S phase, G2 gap, and M phase. Blocking of the cell cycle progression
of cancer cells is regarded as an effective means of cancer treatment.55 Many phytochemicals act as antiproliferative
agents by restraining cell cycle progression or inducing apoptosis
in cancer cells.56 In this study, the cell
cycle distribution and apoptosis of MCF-7 cells were explored to elucidate
the antiproliferation mechanism of lucidimine B. Propidium iodide
(PI) is a fluorescent agent and used as a DNA content in cell cycle
analysis. The cell cycle distributions of MCF-7 cells after treatment
with lucidimine B stained by PI are shown in Figure 3. An obvious increase in the percentage of
S phase inhibition of MCF-7 cells was detected in a dose-dependent
manner. An increase in DNA concentration was also observed at the
G2/M phase in treated cells; however, the proportion of DNA at the
G0/G1 phase decreased along with the increases of the S and G2/M phases.
The results obtained indicated that lucidimine B could induce DNA
fragmentation and impact cell cycle progression at the S phase.

concentrations of lucidimine B [control (A),
10 (B), 50 (C), and 100 μg/mL (D)] on cell cycle in MCF-7 cells,

± SD, n = 3). *P < 0.05.

Induction of Apoptosis
by Lucidimine B
The apoptosis
periods and rates of MCF-7 cells induced by lucidimine B were investigated
using flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Figure 4, MCF-7 cells that were treated with lucidimine
B (0.04 μmol/mL) displayed significant induction in the rate
of early-stage apoptosis (14.2 ± 1.0%) when compared to the control
group (0.7 ± 0.1%). In the meantime, a progressive reduction
of the rate was obtained for cells treated by 0.21 μmol/mL (5.4
± 0.6%) and 0.42 μmol/mL (4.3 ± 0.4%) lucidimine B.
Moreover, the percentage of late-stage apoptosis in MCF-7 cells showed
similar distinct changes. Clearly, these results indicated that lucidimine
B induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells in the early stages of the cell
cycle.

cells (Q3); and the lower right quadrant displays early apoptotic
cells (Q4). The ratios of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells induced by lucidimine

Impact on Mitochondrial
Membrane Potential Exerted by Lucidimine
B
Mitochondria play an important role in energy production
in MCF-7 cells, being regarded as their energy powerhouses.57 Many factors can cause mitochondrial damage,
which, in turn, increases mitochondrial membrane permeability and
subsequent dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).58 Normally, when cells were stained with JC-1,
red fluorescence was detected in normal cells, whereas green fluorescence
was detected in apoptotic cells with impaired mitochondria. The red/green
fluorescence intensity quantifies the MMP change; the lower the red/green
fluorescence intensity, the stronger impaired the mitochondria. From Figure 5, the cell affected
by lucidimine B displayed a decrease in MMP compared with that of
the control group, indicating that lucidimine B damaged the mitochondrial
function and increased the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane.
With increased permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, the release
of cytochrome c was promoted, which activates procaspase
9 and thus downstream caspases, which amplify the death process.59 Loss of MMP is considered as a pathway for apoptosis,
and increase of MMP loss could lead to the activation of apoptosis-inducing
factors from mitochondria, which promotes apoptosis by inactivating
inhibitors of apoptosis proteins.60,61

Conclusions
The work detailed above, when considered
in conjunction with various
studies conducted on other components from G. lucidum, has provided valuable scientific evidence to support the health
claims with respect to G. lucidum as
nutraceuticals. Our work has proved that alkaloid components such
as lucidimine B from G. lucidum display
valuable yet underestimated antioxidant and antiproliferative potencies.
Further mechanistic studies revealed that lucidimine B could induce
MCF-7 cell cycle arrest in the S phase, inducing DNA fragmentation
and blocking cell cycle progression of MCF-7 cells. The proliferation
of MCF-7 cells being treated with lucidimine B was suppressed in early-stage
apoptosis, and they displayed decreased MMP. The synthetic protocols
used to obtain the title natural products and certain analogues are
robust ones and provide the capacity to generate a significant number
of variants of the title compounds.

General Synthetic
Protocols
Proton (1H)
and carbon (13C) NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C
on a Bruker spectrometer operated at 400 MHz for proton and 100 MHz
for carbon nuclei. For 1H NMR spectra, signals arising
from the residual protio-forms of the solvent were used as the internal
standards. 1H NMR data were recorded as follows: chemical
shift (δ) [multiplicity, coupling constant(s) J (Hz), relative integral], where multiplicity is defined as s = singlet;
d = doublet; t = triplet; q = quartet; and m = multiplet or combinations
of the above. Low-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra
were recorded on a single quadrupole liquid chromatograph–mass
spectrometer, whereas high-resolution measurements were conducted
on a time-of-flight instrument. Low- and high-resolution electron
ionization (EI) mass spectra were recorded on a magnetic-sector machine.
Melting points were measured on an OptiMelt automated melting point
system and are uncorrected. Infrared spectra (νmax) were recorded on a PerkinElmer 1800 Series FTIR spectrometer. Samples
were analyzed as thin films on KBr plates. Eluted plates were visualized
using a 254 nm UV lamp. Where necessary, reactions were performed
under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Specific Chemical Transformations
2-Cyclopentylidenemalononitrile 7
The
procedure for the preparation of 7 was adapted from the
literature.41 Thus, a magnetically stirred
mixture of cyclopentanone (5) (10.0 g, 118.9 mmol), malononitrile
(6) (9.4 g, 142.7 mmol), morpholine (0.5 g, 5.7 mmol),
and methanesulfonic acid (0.5 g, 5.2 mmol) was heated at 120 °C
for 1 h before being cooled to 18 °C. The mixture thus obtained
was subjected to flash chromatography (silica, hexane elution) to
afford, after concentration of the relevant fractions (Rf = 0.8), malononitrile 7 (14.0 g, 89%) as
clear colorless oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3):

Step (i): Following
a protocol reported by McQuade et al.,42 a magnetically stirred mixture of malononitrile 7 (14.0
g, 105.9 mmol) in toluene (150 mL) was treated with Ac2O (2.0 mL, 21.2 mmol) and DMF-DMA (16.9 mL, 127.1 mmol), and the
resulting mixture was stirred at 18 °C for 12 h. Hexane (200

DPPH Radical Scavenging
Assay
A DPPH radical scavenging
assay was developed following the published method and with minor
modification.44 Briefly, 2 mL of DPPH (0.2
mM, in methanol) was mixed with 1 mL of the sample at different concentrations,
and methanol was used as a control. Then, the various solutions were
completely mixed and allowed to stand in dark at room temperature
for 30 min before being tested for absorbance at 517 nm using a microplate
reader (Tecan M200 PRO, Switzerland). The DPPH radical scavenging
activity of the sample was calculated using the following formula:  

The percentages of DPPH radical scavenging
activities were plotted against the sample concentrations to obtain
the corresponding EC50 values, which were defined as the
concentration of sample necessary to cause a 50% scavenging effect.

ABTS Radical Scavenging Assay
An ABTS radical scavenging
assay was employed following a published protocol.44 The ABTS radical cation working solution with an absorbance
of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm was prepared by mixing ABTS and potassium
persulfate. A sample solution (0.15 mL) mixed with the ABTS working
solution (2.85 mL) was left at room temperature for 10 min before
being tested for absorbance at 734 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan
M200 PRO, Switzerland). The control containing the solvent instead
of the sample solution was also prepared. The ABTS radical scavenging
activity of the sample was calculated by the following formula:  

Again, the percentages of ABTS radical
scavenging activities were plotted against the sample concentration
to obtain the EC50 values, which were defined as the concentration
of sample necessary to cause a 50% scavenging effect.

PSC Assay
Peroxyl radical scavenging assay was performed
using a reported method with modification.45 Vitamin C was selected as a standard, and phosphate buffer was used
as the reaction medium. Fluorescence was monitored with a Fluoroskan
Ascent fluorescence spectrophotometer (Tecan M200 PRO, Switzerland)
for 23 cycles. Results were shown as μmol vitamin C equiv/g.

Cell Lines and Cell Culture
Human breast cancer cell
lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) were maintained in DMEM (high glucose)
supplemented with streptomycin (50 units/mL), penicillin (100 units/mL),
and 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Antiproliferative Ability of Lucidimine B
and Lucidimine C
An antiproliferation test was carried out
using a methylene blue
assay.62 Cells were seeded at a density
of 1 × 104 cells/well on a clear 96-well microplate
in 100 μL of growth medium/well. After 6 h at 37 °C, the
growth medium was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution. The free FBS medium with different concentrations
of samples was then added to the well, whereas the same medium without
sample served as the control. After an additional 48 h of incubation,
the wells were stained with methylene blue solution. The absorbance
was measured at 570 nm in a microplate reader.

Determination of Cell Cycle
and Apoptosis through Flow Cytometry
Samples were prepared
with free FBS medium under different concentrations.
The cell cycle distribution of MCF-7 cells after having been treated
for 24 h were washed with PBS and harvested with trypsinization. According
to the PI detection kit, the harvested cells were treated
with 70% ethanol solution at −20 °C for a period of 12
h and then stained by PI-containing RNAse at 37 °C for 15 min.
For each sample, 10 000 events were recorded by flow cytometry.
The results were determined by the amount of PI intercalated to DNA
and analyzed by CellQuest research software (FACSCanto, Becton, Dickinson
and Company, USA). Proportion of apoptotic MCF-7 cells was determined
through an annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit. The samples
were prepared with free FBS media at different concentrations. The
MCF-7 cells treated with various concentrations of lucidimine B for
24 h were washed with PBS and harvested with trypsinization. The harvested
cells were stained with annexin V-FITC/PI at 37 °C for 15 min.
For each sample, 10 000 events were recorded by flow cytometry.
The data were collected and analyzed by CellQuest research software.

Determination of MMP
The MMPs of MCF-7 cells were measured
and analyzed with a JC-1 detection kit. Samples were prepared with
free FBS media at various concentrations. MCF-7 cells were treated
with different concentrations of lucidimine B for 24 h, washed with
PBS, and harvested with trypsinization. The harvested cells were suspended
and dyed using JC-1 at room temperature for 15 min. Then, the dyed
cells were centrifuged, washed once with PBS, and resuspended with
200 μL of PBS. The excitation wavelength for flow cytometric
analysis was 488 nm, and the emission wavelengths were 525 nm for
green fluorescence analysis and 590 nm for red fluorescence. For each
sample, 10 000 events were recorded by flow cytometry.

Statistical
Analysis
Each bioactivity evaluation experiment
was performed three times. The results were presented as mean values
± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software
(version 19.0) to determine the significant differences. All values
were assessed by one-way analysis of variance in conjunction with
Duncan’s new multiple-range test. A difference was considered
significant when P < 0.05.
