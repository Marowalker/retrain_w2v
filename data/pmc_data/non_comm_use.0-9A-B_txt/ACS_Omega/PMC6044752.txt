ω-Transaminases are attractive
biocatalysts for the production
of chiral amines. These enzymes usually have a broad substrate range.
Their substrates include hydrophobic amines as well as amino acids,
a feature referred to as dual-substrate recognition. In the present
study, the reaction mechanism for the half-transamination of l-alanine to pyruvate in (S)-selective Chromobacterium violaceum ω-transaminase is
investigated using density functional theory calculations. The role
of a flexible arginine residue, Arg416, in the dual-substrate recognition
is investigated by employing two active-site models, one including
this residue and one lacking it. The results of this study are compared
to those of the mechanism of the conversion of (S)-1-phenylethylamine to acetophenone. The calculations suggest that
the deaminations of amino acids and hydrophobic amines follow essentially
the same mechanism, but the energetics of the reactions differ significantly.
It is shown that the amine is kinetically favored in the half-transamination
of l-alanine/pyruvate, whereas the ketone is kinetically
favored in the half-transamination of (S)-1-phenylethylamine/acetophenone.
The calculations further support the proposal that the arginine residue
facilitates the dual-substrate recognition by functioning as an arginine
switch, where the side chain is positioned inside or outside of the
active site depending on the substrate. Arg416 participates in the
binding of l-alanine by forming a salt bridge to the carboxylate
moiety, whereas the conversion of (S)-1-phenylethylamine
is feasible in the absence of Arg416, which here represents the case
in which the side chain of Arg416 is positioned outside of the active
site.

I Introduction
Transaminases
(TAs) catalyze the reversible interchange of amino
and keto groups, by the use of the coenzyme pyridoxal-5′-phosphate
(PLP).1 There are two types of TAs, α-transaminases,
which convert α-amino and α-keto acids, and ω-transaminases
(ωTAs), which also accept amino and keto acids in which the
amino or keto group is in a non-α position relative to the carboxyl
group, called ω-amino or ω-keto acids, respectively.2−4 Some ωTAs additionally have the ability to enantioselectively
convert a variety of different amines and ketones without a carboxyl
group.2−7 Consequently, they are also called amine transaminases in the literature.3,4,8,9 ωTAs
have received much attention in the last decade as they can be used
as biocatalysts for the production of chiral amines.10−18 One example of such a biocatalytically useful ωTA is the (S)-selective ωTA ((S)-ωTA)
from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-ωTA).
Cv-ωTA has a broad substrate range, converting both hydrophobic
amines and amino acids, such as (S)-1-phenylethylamine
((S)-1-PEA) and l-alanine (l-Ala),
respectively,19 and has been applied successfully
for the production of optically pure amines.20

Many PLP-dependent enzymes, including TAs, require the formation
of a so-called internal aldimine (E-PLP), before the main reaction.
In this process, the PLP coenzyme becomes covalently bound to an active-site
lysine residue as a protonated Schiff base, which constitutes the
active form of the enzyme.3,10 The transamination
reaction consists of two half-transamination equilibria, as shown
in Scheme 1. An amino
donor is converted to the corresponding ketone or aldehyde, resulting
in the conversion of E-PLP to pyridoxamine-5′-phosphate (PMP).
The E-PLP is then regenerated by the reaction of another ketone or
aldehyde, which is then converted to an amine.21,22

Scheme 1 Complete Reaction Cycle of the ωTA-Catalyzed Transamination
of (S)-1-PEA to Acetophenone and Pyruvate to l-Ala
The box represents stereoselective
synthesis, where (S)-1-PEA is produced by the use
of l-Ala as amino donor and the prochiral acetophenone as
amino acceptor. In kinetic resolution, (R)-1-PEA
can be isolated from racemic 1-PEA as the (S)-enantiomer
is consumed.

In biocatalytic applications,
chiral amines may be kinetically
resolved by applying an ωTA and a keto acid, for example, pyruvate.12,14,18 In cases where the enantiospecificity
is high, essentially only one enantiomer of the amino substrate is
consumed to produce the corresponding ketone and alanine, and the
other enantiomer of the amino substrate can then be isolated in an
enantiopure form. For stereoselective synthesis, alanine, for example,
can be used as an amino donor for a prochiral ketone, to produce an
enantiopure target amine.11,12,14,18 The kinetic resolution option
is limited to a maximum theoretical conversion of 50%, whereas the
stereoselective synthesis may give a full conversion but then usually
requires equilibrium displacement.11−14,18

In TAs, two structurally and chemically different substrates
(e.g.,
a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic substrate) are converted in a subsequent
manner, as shown in Scheme 1. The feature of recognizing two different substrates while
discriminating against other substrates using the same active site
is called dual-substrate recognition or dual specificity.4,23−25 Various proposals have been put forward as to how
this can be achieved in different TAs.4,23−25 For (S)-ωTAs, like Cv-ωTA, it has been
suggested that a flexible arginine residue is responsible for the
binding of acidic substrates having a carboxylate functional group,
and forms thus the structural basis for the dual-substrate recognition.9 The side chain of this arginine, located near
the channel to the active site, is found to be oriented in different
directions in the crystal structures of several known (S)-ωTAs, indicating that it is highly flexible (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Superposition of crystal
structures of several (S)-ωTAs with the flexible
arginine residue (Arg416 in Cv-ωTA)
and the PLP coenzyme (PLP covalently bound to Lys288 in Cv-ωTA)
in stick representation. In PDB 4A6T/Cv-ωTA (yellow), the side chain
of the arginine residue has two different orientations in the two
monomers (chains A and B); the same is observed in PDB 3HMU/Silicibacter
pomeroyi (green) and PDB 3I5T/Rhodobacter sphaeroides KD131 (cyan). In PDB 3FCR/Silicibacter sp. TM1040 (magenta),
the side chain of the arginine residue has two different orientations
in the same monomer.

By applying molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations
to the crystal structure of (S)-ωTA from S. pomeroyi (PDB 3HMU), Steffen-Munsberg et al. showed that
the arginine residue (Arg417) may form a salt bridge with the carboxylate
group of α- and ω-amino acids, such as l-Ala
and γ-aminobutyrate, respectively, if the side chain of the
arginine points toward the PLP.9 On the
other hand, hydrophobic amines, such as (S)-1-PEA,
may be accommodated in the active site if the side chain of the arginine
is oriented away from the PLP.9 Similar
results were obtained in a molecular docking study using the crystal
structure of (S)-ωTA from Paracoccus
denitrificans (PDB 4GRX).26 Furthermore,
in the crystal structure of Cv-ωTA with suicide inhibitor gabaculine
(PDB 4BA5),
it is seen that the flexible arginine residue (Arg416) forms a salt
bridge with the carboxylate group of the inhibitor.27

The idea of an arginine switch for dual-substrate
recognition has
also been proposed for other TAs, for example, aromatic amino acid
TAs,28 aspartate TAs,29−31 and recently
also for (R)-selective ωTAs.32−34 These enzymes
have different active-site architectures as compared to those of (S)-ωTAs, and consequently the proposed flexible arginine
is in different positions.9,25,32

Recently, we have described by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations the detailed mechanism of the half-transamination reaction
for the conversion of (S)-1-PEA to acetophenone in
Cv-ωTA.35 On the basis of a crystal
structure of the holo enzyme containing the PLP coenzyme
covalently bound to an active-site lysine residue (E-PLP), a large
active-site model was designed, and the involved transition states
and intermediates were characterized. The calculations showed that
the amino substrate becomes covalently bound to PLP, replacing the
lysine residue, through geminal diamine intermediates, to form the
so-called external aldimine. The exchange of the amino group of the
substrate to a keto group then proceeds through the deprotonation
of the external aldimine by the lysine residue, forming a planar quinonoid
intermediate. Subsequent proton transfers yield a ketimine, to which
water is added to form a hemiaminal. In the final steps, proton rearrangements
and cleavage of the carbon–nitrogen bond yield the half-transamination
products, ketone and PMP, which are no longer covalently bound to
each other. These steps are shown in Scheme 2, for the l-alanine substrate, which
is the subject of the current study.

Scheme 2 Reaction Mechanism
for the Half-Transamination of l-Ala
to Pyruvate in Cv-ωTA
In the present study, we use DFT calculations to investigate
the
reaction mechanism for the half-transamination of l-Ala to
pyruvate in Cv-ωTA. Together with the previous study,35 the complete transamination cycle of (S)-1-PEA to acetophenone and pyruvate to l-Ala
is thus described. On the basis of the geometries of the intermediates
and transition states, and the energy profiles of the reaction mechanism
obtained in the current and previous works, we examine and discuss
the differences and similarities in the conversions of hydrophobic
amines and amino acids in ωTAs. We also examine the role of
the flexible arginine residue in the dual-substrate recognition by
employing two active-site models, one including this residue and one
lacking it. The calculated energy profiles are evaluated, and the
effect of the flexible arginine residue on the energetics of the reaction
is assessed.

II Results and Discussion
II.I Active-Site Models
In this work,
two active-site models of Cv-ωTA are employed, one including
the flexible Arg416 residue and one lacking it. The models were generated
from the crystal structure of the holo enzyme (PDB 4A6T(36)) and include the l-Ala and water substrates, the
amino acids that make up the binding site (Phe22, Leu59, Trp60, Phe88′,
Tyr153, Ile262, and Thr321′, and Gly230 and Ala231 and the
backbone between them), a part of the PLP coenzyme covalently bound
to the active-site lysine residue Lys288 (E-PLP), and Asp259 that
forms a hydrogen bond to the nitrogen of PLP. In the model that includes
Arg416, this residue was taken from the chain A monomer of the enzyme,
and the guanidinium group was manually turned to face the active site,
thus forming a salt bridge to the carboxylate group of the l-Ala substrate (see Figure 2c). The model without the Arg416 residue (Figure 2b) is thus identical to the
one used in the previous study (Figure 2a),35 but with l-Ala as a substrate instead of (S)-1-PEA.

Figure 2 Optimized structures
of the Cv-ωTA active-site models (ES) with (a)
the (S)-1-PEA substrate, (b)
the l-Ala substrate, and (c) the l-Ala substrate
and additionally the flexible arginine residue, Arg416. In ES, the PLP coenzyme is covalently bound to Lys288, referred to as
the internal aldimine (E-PLP). Asterisks indicate atoms that were
kept fixed at their crystallographic positions during the geometry
optimizations, and primes indicate residues from one of the two subunits
in the homodimer. Color scheme for the atoms is as follows: light
blue for carbons of the substrate, orange for carbons of the PLP-Lys288
moiety, pink for carbons of Arg416, red for oxygens, blue for nitrogen,
and white for hydrogens. Nonpolar hydrogen atoms have been omitted.
Distances are given in angström.

The various residues were truncated at either the α-
or β-carbons,
as shown in Figure 2, and all hydrogen atoms were added manually. The phosphate group
of PLP was not included, apart from the bridging oxygen, saturated
with a hydrogen atom. The alanine substrate in solution is mainly
in the zwitterionic form. However, because the reaction starts with
the amino group of the substrate making a nucleophilic attack on the
internal aldimine (E-PLP), l-Ala has to lose a proton on
entry into the active site such that the transamination reaction can
take place. Therefore, the l-Ala substrate was modeled in
the deprotonated state in the active site, that is, with a neutral
amino group and a negatively charged carboxylate group.

A number
of atoms were kept fixed to their crystallographic positions
during the geometry optimizations to preserve the overall structure
of the active site. These atoms are indicated by asterisks in Figure 2. The atom fixation
is a standard procedure in the cluster approach. The fixed atoms were
chosen on the basis of initial preliminary geometry optimizations
of one of the active-site models, to avoid large artificial movements
as compared to the crystal structure. The residues of the active-site
models are granted enough flexibility to adapt to the specific substrate
studied, be it (S)-1-PEA or l-Ala. This
is evident from the optimized geometries of the enzyme–substrate
complexes shown in Figure 2, where the residues (e.g., Tyr153, Trp60, Thr321, and Leu59)
move to accommodate the substrates in a favorable manner.

The
active-site models with and without Arg416 consist of 211 and
189 atoms, respectively, and have total charges of 0 and −1,
respectively.

II.II Mechanism Including Arg416
The
reaction mechanism of the Cv-ωTA-catalyzed half-transamination
of l-Ala to pyruvate obtained on the basis of the present
calculations is presented in Scheme 2. The calculated energy profiles of this reaction using
the two active-site models, that is, with and without the flexible
arginine residue (see above), are shown in Figure 3 together with the results from the previous
study, describing the half-transamination of (S)-1-PEA
to acetophenone.35 Optimized structures
of selected intermediates and transition states are shown in Figure 4. First, we focus
on examining the mechanism of the conversion of l-Ala to
pyruvate compared to the previously described mechanism of the conversion
of (S)-1-PEA to acetophenone.35 As it turned out, the active-site model that includes the
flexible arginine residue, Arg416, resulted in the mechanism with
the most plausible energies (Scheme 2). In this model, Arg416 forms a salt bridge to the
carboxylate group of l-Ala. Hence, Arg416 participates in
the binding of acidic substrates, that is, substrates having a carboxylate
functional group. The role of Arg416 in the dual-substrate recognition,
evaluated on the basis of the energetics of the two active-site models
(Figure 3), will be
discussed in the next subsection.

half-transamination
reaction of l-Ala to pyruvate, employing two active-site
models, with Arg416 (blue) and without Arg416 (red), along with the

(black) using the active-site model without Arg416.

the reaction
pathway in the Cv-ωTA active-site model that includes Arg416.
Some residues and most nonpolar hydrogens have been omitted for clarity.
The nonpolar hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the substrate nitrogen
are shown when relevant.

The obtained detailed reaction mechanism, presented in Scheme 2, reveals that the
deamination of the amino acid, l-Ala, follows essentially
the same mechanism as the deamination of the hydrophobic amine, (S)-1-PEA, with some minor changes that are indicated below.
There are, however, significant differences in the calculated energies
of intermediates and transition states, which will have implications
on the kinetics of the reaction.

The first difference in the
reaction of l-Ala compared
to that of (S)-1-PEA is already seen in the enzyme–substrate
complex (ES). By comparing the geometries of ES for l-Ala (Figure 2c) and (S)-1-PEA (Figure 2a), it can be noted that there are differences
in the hydrogen-bonding network. Because of the existence of a carboxylate
moiety in l-Ala, several hydrogen bonds to the surrounding
residues and co-substrate water arise. The l-Ala substrate
is positioned such that the carboxylate group forms a salt bridge
with the guanidinium group of Arg416 as well as hydrogen bonds to
Tyr153 and the water molecule. This water molecule is further hydrogen-bonded
to Trp60, the oxygen of PLP, and the backbone nitrogen of Ala231.
The amino group of l-Ala is hydrogen-bonded to Thr321. The
salt bridge to Arg416 and the hydrogen bond to Tyr153 are maintained
throughout the entire reaction pathway.

As described in Introduction, in the initial
steps of the transamination reaction, the active-site lysine residue,
Lys288, which is covalently bound to the PLP coenzyme as a protonated
Schiff base, is replaced by the amino substrate, which becomes covalently
bound to PLP, generating a new Schiff base (see Scheme 2). The former is called the internal aldimine
(E-PLP), and the latter is called the external aldimine. From the
calculated energy profiles in Figure 3, it can be concluded that the initial steps of the
reaction, from the internal aldimine (ES) to the formation
of the external aldimine at TS3, proceed through transition
states of low energies (≤10.6 kcal/mol relative to ES) in the reactions with both l-Ala and (S)-1-PEA.

In the reaction with l-Ala, the initial nucleophilic
attack
by the amino group of the substrate on the internal aldimine (ES → Int1a) and the proton transfer between the amino
group of the substrate and the oxygen of PLP (Int1a →
Int1b) can take place as either two separate steps or a single
step accompanied by a concerted proton shuttling by the water molecule.
The energy difference between the two scenarios is very small, with
the stepwise case (via TS1a and TS1b) being
only 0.5 kcal/mol lower than the concerted case. Similarly, in the
reaction with (S)-1-PEA, two alternative concerted
transition states were located for the transformation ES →
Int1b.35 In that case, the proton
transfer can occur directly or with the assistance of the water molecule
in the same manner as for l-Ala. The latter path was found
to be 1.4 kcal/mol lower in energy. Thus, for both l-Ala
and (S)-1-PEA, the energy differences are very small,
and the two cases are basically indistinguishable. However, for consistency,
in Figure 3 we report
the transition state with the slightly lower energy for each substrate.

In the external aldimine (Int3) for l-Ala,
the active-site lysine residue, Lys288, and the water substrate are
positioned in a similar manner to that in Int3 for (S)-1-PEA. In the newly created hydrogen-bonding network,
Lys288 is hydrogen-bonded to the oxygen of PLP and the water molecule,
which, in turn, is hydrogen-bonded to Thr321 and the carboxylate group
of the substrate (see Figure 4). The latter hydrogen bond is missing in the reaction with
(S)-1-PEA as it has a benzene ring instead of a carboxylate
group. This hydrogen-bonding network is essentially maintained in
the following reaction steps until the water molecule is consumed
in the formation of the hemiaminal at TS7. For example,
in the ketimine (Int6), the same hydrogen-bonding network
as in Int3 is observed, whereas in the hemiaminal (Int7), Lys288 and Thr321 are hydrogen-bonded to the newly
formed hydroxyl group (see Figure 4).

Interestingly, there is a difference in the
relative energies of Int3 and Int6 in the
two half-transamination
reactions (see Figure 3). In the reaction with l-Ala, Int3 is calculated
to be 2.8 kcal/mol lower in energy than ES, that is,
the external aldimine, Int3, is more stable than the
internal aldimine, ES. On the other hand, in the reaction
with (S)-1-PEA, they are of equal energy. At the
ketimine Int6, the opposite trend is observed. In the
reaction with (S)-1-PEA, Int6 is 2.1
kcal/mol lower in energy than ES, whereas they are of
equal energy in the reaction with l-Ala. How this difference
in the relative energies of Int3 and Int6 influences the kinetics of the reactions will be discussed below.

The exchange of the amino group of the substrate to a keto group
in the half-transamination product is initiated at Int3 and proceeds through several transition states of relatively high-energy
barriers as compared to those in the initial steps. In both reactions,
with l-Ala and (S)-1-PEA, the three TSs
(TS4, TS6, and TS7) are of
similar heights (see Figure 3). TS4 is the deprotonation of the external aldimine
by Lys288 with the assistance of the water molecule as a proton shuttle, TS6 is the protonation of the planar quinonoid intermediate
by Lys288, and TS7 is the addition of water to the ketimine
intermediate with the assistance of Lys288 as a proton shuttle (see Scheme 2 and Figure 4).

In the reaction with
(S)-1-PEA, the calculated
energies of TS4 and TS6 are 19.3 and 15.3
kcal/mol, respectively, relative to Int3, whereas TS7 has a calculated energy of 14.6 kcal/mol, relative to Int6. Hence, TS4 was concluded to be the rate-determining
step in this reaction.35 For l-Ala, the calculated energies of TS4, TS6, and TS7 relative to Int3 are 21.3, 21.7,
and 20.2 kcal/mol, respectively. The difference in energy between
these TSs is thus very small, certainly within the expected error
of the adopted methodology. It is therefore not possible on the basis
of the current calculations to determine which one of these TSs is
rate-limiting, or whether one, two, or all three of them contribute
to the observed rate of the reaction. A rather small change in the
energy of any of these three TSs would change the conclusion regarding
this issue.

As seen in Figure 3, the final steps of the reaction, which yield the
ketone product
and PMP (E:PMP), also proceed through transition states
of low energies (≤7.6 kcal/mol relative to ES),
similarly to the initial steps of the reaction. In the reaction with l-Ala, the proton rearrangements with the assistance of Lys288
as a proton shuttle and the cleavage of the carbon–nitrogen
bond in the hemiaminal were found to occur concertedly in TS8, as shown in Scheme 2. In the reaction with (S)-1-PEA, this transformation
was previously found to be a stepwise process.35

As mentioned above, there is a difference in the
relative energies
of Int3 and Int6 in the two half-transamination
reactions, which influences the kinetics of the reactions. In the
reaction with (S)-1-PEA, the lowest energy point
was found to be the ketimine Int6, at −2.1 kcal/mol
relative to ES, which gives an overall energy barrier
of 21.1 kcal/mol for the reverse reaction (Int6 → TS4). Thus, in the half-transamination of (S)-1-PEA/acetophenone,
the ketone is kinetically favored, as the energy barrier of the forward
reaction is 1.8 kcal/mol lower than that of the reverse reaction.35 In contrast, for the half-transamination of l-Ala/pyruvate, the opposite is observed, that is, the amine
is kinetically favored. Here, the lowest energy point is the external
aldimine, Int3, at −2.8 kcal/mol relative to ES, which results in an overall energy barrier of 18.7 kcal/mol
for the reverse reaction (Int6 → TS6), that is,
3 kcal/mol lower than the energy barrier of the forward reaction (21.7
kcal/mol). These observations are consistent with experimental findings.
Thus, it has been shown that ωTAs are suitable for the kinetic
resolution of racemic 1-PEA using pyruvate as amino acceptor because
of a high deamination reaction rate from (S)-1-PEA
and a high amination reaction rate to pyruvate.37 That is, acetophenone is the kinetically favored product
in the first half-transamination reaction, and l-Ala is favored
in the second half, which effectively regenerates the holo enzyme (E-PLP).

II.III Mechanism without Arg416
In the
above-presented mechanism for the reaction with l-Ala (Scheme 2), Arg416 forms a
salt bridge to the carboxylate group of l-Ala and thus participates
in the binding of the substrate. To evaluate the role of Arg416 as
an arginine switch, we employed an active-site model without this
residue and calculated the energy profile for the entire reaction.
The effect of Arg416 on the energetics of the reaction is assessed
by analyzing the energy profiles of the two active-site models, with
and without Arg416, as presented in Figure 3. It is found that the deamination of l-Ala follows the same mechanism with and without Arg416, the
only exception being the step Int7 → TS8 → E:PMP. In the reaction of l-Ala without Arg416, the proton transfer
from the oxygen of PLP to the nitrogen of the hemiaminal occurs as
a separate step before TS8, similarly to the reaction
with (S)-1-PEA.35 However,
the calculations show that the overall energy barrier without Arg416
is 25.2 kcal/mol (ES → TS6), which is 3.5 kcal/mol
higher than the overall calculated energy barrier for l-Ala
with Arg416 (Int3 → TS6). This corresponds to
a more than 100-fold slower reaction.

The high overall energy
barrier in the reaction of l-Ala without Arg416 stems from
the fact that the enzyme–substrate complex (ES) is the lowest energy point, that is, 3.0 kcal/mol lower in energy
than the external aldimine, Int3. As seen in Figure 2b, when Arg416 is
not present to bind to the carboxylate moiety of the substrate, l-Ala is positioned such that the carboxylate group is oriented
toward PLP and the water molecule, rather than toward the opening
of the active site. l-Ala is further hydrogen-bonded to Thr321,
Trp60, Tyr153, and the water molecule. This energetically favorable
conformation found for ES without Arg416 represents a
nonproductive binding mode, as a repositioning of the substrate and
a movement of Tyr153 are required before the first reaction step,
which is the nucleophilic attack by the amino group of the substrate
on the internal aldimine. An alternative conformation of ES, in which the l-Ala substrate is more suitably positioned
for the first reaction step, similarly to that in ES with
Arg416 (see optimized structure in the Supporting Information), was found to be 6.6 kcal/mol higher in energy
than ES, that is, 3.6 kcal/mol higher in energy than Int3.

The results above are consistent with the mutagenesis
experiments
on (S)-ωTAs from R. sphaeroides KD131 and Silicibacter sp. TM1040.9 It has thus been shown that mutating the flexible arginine
residue (Arg418 and Arg420, respectively) to alanine results in a
significantly decreased transamination activity toward (S)-1-PEA in combination with acidic amino acceptors (pyruvate or succinate
semialdehyde), and a hardly affected transamination activity when
using an aliphatic amino acceptor (butyraldehyde).9 As mentioned above, it is proposed that the side chain
of the arginine residue adopts a stretched conformation to form a
salt bridge to the carboxylate moiety of acidic substrates, whereas
it is oriented away from the active site when substrates lacking a
carboxylate group are accommodated in the enzyme.9 Hence, mutating this arginine to alanine affects the binding
of acidic substrates by eliminating the possibility of a salt bridge
but does not significantly affect the binding of hydrophobic substrates.
The calculations performed in the current study and the previous study35 support these findings. As seen in Figure 3, the half-transamination
of l-Ala to pyruvate is less feasible without Arg416 because
of the high overall energy barrier of 25.2 kcal/mol (ES →
TS6), whereas the half-transamination of (S)-1-PEA to acetophenone is attainable because of the lower barrier
of 19.3 kcal/mol (Int3 → TS4). In the latter reaction,
the absence of Arg416 in the active-site model can effectively be
considered to represent both the mutant reaction and the wild-type
reaction (in which the side chain of the arginine residue is positioned
outside of the active site). Thus, it is reasonable that the transamination
of (S)-1-PEA in combination with an aliphatic amino
acceptor is barely affected by the mutation, as both substrates lack
a carboxylate group. Further, it was observed that the alanine mutants
had some residual activity for the transamination of (S)-1-PEA in combination with acidic amino acceptors.9 To explain this, it was proposed that a tryptophan/tyrosine
residue (Trp61 and Tyr59, respectively, equivalent to Trp60 in Cv-ωTA)
is also involved in the substrate binding.9 This is also supported by our calculations, which indicate that
both Trp60 and Tyr153 are hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate group
of l-Ala without Arg416 (see Figure 2b). These hydrogen bonds are maintained throughout
the reaction pathway.

III Conclusions
In
this study, we have investigated the reaction mechanism for
the half-transamination of l-Ala to pyruvate in the (S)-ωTA from C. violaceum using DFT calculations. We have also examined the role of a flexible
arginine residue, Arg416, in the dual-substrate recognition, that
is, the ability of an enzyme to recognize and convert two different
substrates. For this, two active-site models were employed, one including
Arg416 and one lacking it. The obtained reaction mechanism is presented
in Scheme 2, and the
associated energy profiles are shown in Figure 3. The mechanism of the conversion of l-Ala to pyruvate has been evaluated compared to that of the
conversion of (S)-1-PEA to acetophenone, and the
effect of the flexible arginine residue on the energetics of the reaction
has been assessed by analyzing the energy profiles of the two active-site
models, with and without this residue.

The calculations suggest
that the deamination of l-Ala
and (S)-1-PEA follows essentially the same mechanism,
with some minor differences. However, the energetics of the reactions
are shown to differ significantly. The calculations are not conclusive
on the nature of the rate-determining step in the reaction with l-Ala, as TS4, TS6, and TS7 are calculated to have very similar energies. For (S)-1-PEA, the rate-determining step was previously found to be TS4, which is the deprotonation of the external aldimine.35 In the half-transamination of (S)-1-PEA/acetophenone, the ketimine Int6 is the lowest
energy point; therefore, the ketone is kinetically favored.35 In the half-transamination of l-Ala/pyruvate,
the external aldimine, Int3, is the lowest energy point;
therefore, the amine is kinetically favored. These observations are
consistent with experimental results, which demonstrate that ωTAs
are suitable for the kinetic resolution of racemic 1-PEA when using
pyruvate as the amino acceptor.37

The calculations further support the notion that the dual-substrate
recognition in (S)-ωTAs is governed by the
flexible arginine residue functioning as an arginine switch, which,
depending on the substrate, positions its side chain inside or outside
of the active site. It is shown that the half-transamination of l-Ala to pyruvate is feasible in the presence of Arg416, as
the arginine binds l-Ala by forming a salt bridge to the
carboxylate moiety. Without Arg416, the conversion of l-Ala
is calculated to have a higher overall energy barrier. The conversion
of (S)-1-PEA to acetophenone was previously shown
to have a reasonable energy barrier in line with experimental data
without Arg416,35 which here represents
the case in which the side chain of the arginine residue is positioned
outside of the active site.

The high overall energy barrier
in the reaction of l-Ala
without Arg416 stems from the fact that the nonproductive binding
mode of the internal aldimine, ES, is the lowest energy
point. However, this binding mode might not be as energetically favorable
with larger acidic substrates, such as ω-amino acids, for example,
γ-aminobutyrate, which would then alter the overall energy barrier
in the reaction without Arg416. This might indicate that the conclusion
regarding the role of the flexible arginine could be substrate-dependent.

IV Computational Details
In the current study, we use
the same computational protocol as
in the previous work.35 That is, all calculations
were performed using DFT with the B3LYP functional,38,39 as implemented in the Gaussian09 software package.40 Geometry optimizations were conducted using the 6-31G(d,p)
basis set, while more accurate energies were obtained by performing
single-point calculations on the optimized geometries using the larger
6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set. The 6-31G(d,p) basis set was also used for
frequency calculations to obtain zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections.
The solvation effect of the protein surrounding was estimated by single-point
calculations using the CPCM conductor-like polarizable continuum model,41,42 the 6-31G(d,p) basis set, and the standard value of ε = 4
for the dielectric constant. Empirical dispersion corrections were
added using the B3LYP-D2 method.43,44 Thus, the
final energies are those calculated with the large basis set, corrected
for ZPE, solvation, and dispersion. The enzyme–substrate complex
(ES), that is, the optimized active-site model, is defined
as the zero on the energy scale (0 kcal/mol), and the energies of
intermediates and transition states are reported relative to this
in the energy graph of Figure 3.

Performing the geometry optimizations in the gas phase
with a medium-sized
basis set and then adding the corrections (large basis set, ZPE, solvation,
and dispersion) on the basis of those geometries result in some low-energy
transition states having the final calculated energy lower than one
of its connecting intermediates (e.g., TS2 and TS5). This is an artifact
of the adopted methodology and has been observed also in the previous
study.35 In this case, the energy of the
connecting intermediate can effectively be considered as the barrier
for that step, and the transition-state energy is therefore not indicated
in the energy graph (Figure 3).
