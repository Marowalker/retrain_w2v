Protein
therapeutics has recently attracted interest in various
medical treatments. However, the structure and function preservation
in proteins under physiological conditions is still an important issue
and reliable immobilization techniques are required. In this study,
the thermally assisted complexation of proteins with amphiphilic polyphosphoesters
is proposed as a new methodology for their durability improvement.
Amphiphilic cholesterol-terminated poly(ethylene sodium phosphate)
(CH-PEP·Na) was synthesized via the organocatalytic ring-opening
polymerization of 2-methoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane initiated
by cholesterol as the hydrophobic molecule and followed by demethylation
and neutralization. For the protein nanocarrier preparation, a complex
of the amphiphilic CH-PEP·Na with bovine serum albumin (BSA)
was formed through the hydrophobic interactions between the lipophilic
moieties of the protein and the cholesteryl groups of the CH-PEP·Na
chains, which were induced by thermal treatment at 90 °C. The
resulting complex size ranged between 27 and 51 nm, as confirmed by
dynamic light scattering. The complexes dispersed in an aqueous medium
exhibited a high stability in size for up to 1 month of storage. CH-PEP·Na
efficiently inhibited the thermal aggregation and sedimentation of
BSA, unlike poly(ethylene sodium phosphate) (PEP·Na) and cholesterol-terminated
poly(ethylene glycol) (CH-PEG). In addition, CH-PEP·Na was able
to protect the complexed BSA against proteolytic digestion and the
BSA–CH-PEP·Na complexes well adsorbed onto hydroxyapatite
even in the presence of BSA (5.5 g/dL). Hence, thermally induced protein–CH-PEP·Na
complexes can be a potential tool for the development of bone and
dental applications.

==== Body
Introduction
The demand for the
medical use and commercialization of therapeutic
proteins is forecasted to grow dramatically over the next few years.
The specificity and bioactivity of such proteins have had a positive
impact on the treatments for autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other
human disorders,1−5 but they lack in proteolytic stability and have a short blood circulation
time.6−8 To enhance the pharmacokinetics of the delivered
proteins, several chemical modification techniques, such as the poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) immobilization, called PEGylation,9,10 have
been developed. However, despite the improved intravascular half-life
of the proteins, the PEG non-biodegradability and decreased bioactivity
because of a permanent conjugation are a serious concern.7,11 As an alternative, Wurm and co-workers have proposed degradable
protein–polyphosphoester (PPE) conjugates with a relatively
high bioactivity retention to address such PEG shortcomings.12,13 Nonetheless, protein–polymer conjugations require multistep
preparations and purification. Noncovalent binding is an interesting
alternative formation route involving electrostatic forces, hydrogen
bondings, and hydrophobic attractions. The thermally assisted complexation
of proteins with amphiphilic polymers is a facile and timesaving approach
to create protein carriers, but its challenge lies in suppressing
the protein aggregation and preventing the protein bioactivity from
thermal denaturation. Akiyoshi et al. have designed a cholesterol-bearing
pullulan (CHP) nanogel having a chaperone-like activity for the thermal
stabilization of carbonic anhydrase B:14 the self-assembly of the cholesteryl groups provided physical cross-linking
to form stable CHP nanogels in water. Hence, the use of amphiphilic
CHP for the thermostabilization of proteins can be a significant strategy.

On the other hand, PPEs are promising polymers in the biomedical
field because of their versatility, biocompatibility, enzymatic degradability,
and biomimetic building blocks of natural molecules, that is, nucleic
acids.15−17 In contrast to biodegradable polycarboxylic acid
esters such as poly(lactic acid) and poly(ε-caprolactone), diverse
functional groups can be introduced to PPEs.18,19 Poly(ethylene sodium phosphate) (PEP·Na) is a type of water-soluble
PPE possessing a phosphodiester backbone and negative charges. It
has exhibited strong bone affinity in both in vitro and in vivo and
high cell viability against bone cells.20−22 PEP·Na can be simply
synthesized via the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phosphoester
monomers by using organocatalysts and alcohols as initiators,21−26 whereas its polarity can be conveniently adjusted to be hydrophilic
or amphiphilic by using suitable hydroxyl-containing initiators. Cholesterol,
which is a ubiquitous lipid molecule present in body systems, was
used as an initiator to prepare amphiphilic cholesterol-terminated
PEP·Na (CH-PEP·Na). In this study, amphiphilic CH-PEP·Na
was newly introduced to form complexes with proteins assisted by thermal
treatment. Once the temperature rose, the interior hydrophobic amino
acids of the proteins became exposed. The hydrophobic interactions
between the nonpolar segments of the amphiphilic polymer and the exposed
lipophilic proteins spontaneously occurred, whereas the hydrophilic
PEP·Na chains stabilized such self-assembled complexes at the
periphery because of the electrostatic repulsive force of the phosphate
anions, whereas the polymers also hampered the aggregation of the
unfolded proteins.27 The bovine serum albumin
(BSA) formed a complex with CH-PEP·Na without the need for protein
modification and organic solvents. After the thermally assisted complexation,
CH-PEP·Na exhibited a great potential to form complexes with
BSA at high temperature without BSA thermal aggregation and the peripheral
CH-PEP·Na protected the complexed BSA well under protease conditions.
In addition, the obtained complexes showed affinity for hydroxyapatite
(HAp) by adsorbing onto its surface.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization of PPEs
Three types
of PPEs, cholesterol-terminated poly(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane)
(CH-PMP), CH-PEP·Na, and PEP·Na, were successfully synthesized
via the ROP of 2-methoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane (MP), as shown
in Scheme 1. These
polymers were examined for a targeted degree of polymerization (DP)
of 70. Their molecular weights and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) were
evaluated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), as summarized in Table 1 (GPC traces of the
PPEs are displayed in Figure S1). The proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra (Figure 1) revealed the characteristic
peaks of CH-PMP at 4.3, 3.8, and 0.7–1.0 ppm, which correlate
respectively to the methylene and methyl protons of the PMP chain
and the methyl protons of the cholesteryl group. After demethylation
and cation exchange, the triester PMP was transformed into diester
PEP·Na, demonstrating the upfield shift (3.9 ppm) of the methylene
protons from the polymeric backbone and the disappearance of the methoxy
signal. However, slight methoxyl groups still remained. The percentage
of demethylation calculated from an NMR spectrum is reported in Table 1.

To suppress the protein aggregation under thermal conditions, the
self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers is necessary to stabilize the
proteins. Hence, the critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the amphiphilic
cholesterol-terminated polymers was determined using a pyrene fluorescence
probe in an aqueous medium. The cmc’s of CH-PEP·Na and
CH-PMP were 0.04 and 0.01 g/L, respectively, and the higher value
of CH-PEP·Na was probably due to the higher hydrophilicity of
the anionic PEP·Na compared with the nonionic PMP and to its
anionic repulsion.28

Formation and
Characterization of BSA–PPE Complexes
At 90 °C,
BSA was easily aggregated because of thermal denaturation,
showing white turbidity (Figure 2A). In contrast, the BSA suspensions exhibited transparency
in the presence of amphiphilic CH-PEP·Na. The complex suspensions
became more transparent with increases in the CH-PEP·Na content,
reaching a transmittance of almost 100% as unheated BSA. During the
heat treatment, BSA basically started to unfold and the exposed hydrophobic
parts of denatured BSA led to protein aggregation. After the addition
of CH-PEP·Na, the hydrophobic regions of the denaturing protein
bonded with the cholesteryl appendages at the polymeric chain ends,
whereas the anionic PEP·Na chains, which were exposed to the
surrounding aqueous medium, prevented protein aggregation because
of electrostatic repulsion and steric stabilization.14,27 The other two polymers, CH-PMP and PEP·Na, did not exhibit
any thermal stabilization property for the protein; for the case of
PEP·Na, in particular, the complexes showed the lowest transmittance
because of the absence of nonpolar molecules. Although CH-PMP is an
amphiphilic PPE as CH-PEP·Na, it could not efficiently inhibit
the protein aggregation because of the lower hydrophilicity of PMP
compared with PEP·Na and the absence of electrostatic repulsions.
Another hydrophilic polymer, PEG, containing cholesteryl groups at
the polymeric chain ends (CH-PEG) was also used to form a complex
with BSA (BSA/CH-PEG ratios of 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10). After heat treatment,
the BSA–PEG complexes exhibited a turbid appearance (see Figure S2), revealing the thermal aggregation
of BSA at 90 °C. According to the phase separation of PEG in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),29 hydrophobic
PEG aggregates at high temperatures.30 Therefore,
CH-PEG (MW 5008) lost the hydrophilicity to stabilize BSA during heating.
Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were also performed (see Figure S3) to confirm that CH-PEG does not suppress
the thermal denaturation of the protein.

and observation images (inset) of native
BSA, heated BSA, and BSA–polyphosphoester complexes with different
BSA/polymer molar ratios (1:2, 1:5, and 1:10) (CH-PEP·Na: cholesterol-terminated
poly(ethylene sodium phosphate); PEP·Na: poly(ethylene sodium
phosphate); CH-PMP: cholesterol-terminated poly(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphosphoranedioxaphospholane)).
(B) Circular dichroic spectra of native BSA, heated BSA, and BSA–polyphosphoester
complexes with a molar ratio of 1:10. Mean residual ellipticities
were plotted as a function of wavelength.

To elucidate the effect of different PPEs, the secondary
structural
alteration of complexed BSA was performed using CD measurements (Figure 2B). The CD spectrum
of native BSA showed two negative signals, at 212 and 222 nm, at 37
°C, and the heated BSA exhibited a huge reduction in the CD intensity,
indicating a decrease of the α-helical structure and a denaturation
of BSA upon the thermal treatment.31 The
signals of BSA–CH-PMP and BSA–PEP·Na did not significantly
differ from that of the heated BSA, suggesting that neither CH-PMP
nor PEP·Na could preserve the conformational structure of the
protein. In the presence of CH-PEP·Na (BSA/CH-PEP·Na ratio
of 1:10; the other ratios are shown in Figure S4), the loss in the negative band was interestingly much smaller
compared to that observed for the heated BSA and the other complexes,
suggesting that only CH-PEP·Na could stabilize the complexed
BSA, for the same reason mentioned before. Thus, amphiphilic CH-PEP·Na
can be considered an effective excipient for suppressing thermal denaturation
and aggregation.

The complexation between BSA and CH-PEP·Na
was further confirmed
by GPC (Figure 3A);
native BSA, the BSA–CH-PEP·Na (1:10) complex, and the
unheated mixture of BSA and CH-PEP·Na (1:10) were eluted with
PBS. The GPC traces revealed a decrease in the retention time and
a peak broadening was observed after thermal treatment with the polymer,
indicating the complex formation. In our study it is notable that
the complexation could not occur without thermal inducement, that
is, CH-PEP·Na did not interact with BSA at ambient temperature.
As shown in Figure 3B, BSA and CH-PEP·Na formed spherical-like complexes under thermal
treatment in an aqueous medium. However, a small amount of free BSA
still remained in the complex solution observed from a tiny peak of
the complex trace at the retention time of 14 min (solid line, Figure 3A). 94% of complex
purity was calculated from the area under its GPC trace. In addition,
according to the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, the BSA/CH-PEP·Na
ratio in the complexes was 1:12.7 by mol, resembling feeding ratios
of 1:10.0 equiv. The BSA–CH-PEP·Na (1:10) complex with
weight-average Mw of 1.9 × 105 g/mol was obtained as evaluated by size exclusion chromatography
with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) measurement (see Figure S5). On the basis of the data derived
from the BCA assay and SEC-MALS, we could estimate that a complex
comprising one BSA molecule complexed with 13 CH-PEP·Na chains.
This result verified that CH-PEP·Na had an excellent ability
to protect aggregation of protein molecules.

(1:10) complex (scale bar 200 nm).

To further confirm the complex formation by heat treatment,
the
sizes of the complexes obtained with different feeding polymeric ratios
were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 4). By increasing the amphiphilic
CH-PEP·Na content, the complex size gradually decreased from
51 to 27 nm because, at higher CH-PEP·Na fractions, the polymeric
chains probably stabilized the entire surface of the heat-denatured
proteins, resulting in large protein aggregation blocking and the
formation of smaller complexes. Inhibition of protein aggregation
by high polymeric content was also described, that thermal aggregation
of lysozyme was suppressed with increasing polymeric concentrations
by functioning as a molecular shield.32 This is consistent with the previous result showing the inhibition
of the protein thermal aggregation by CH-PEP·Na. As PPE analogs
are biodegradable, the stability during long-term storage was examined.
Steinbach et al. reported a good stability of degradable poly(ethyl
ethylene phosphate)–protein conjugates during storage at 4
°C for 1 year.33 In our study, the
size and PDI values derived from the DLS data did not significantly
change over 1 month of storage at room temperature and undesirable
aggregates were not found. Hence, BSA–CH-PEP·Na complexes
can ensure a high stability for long-term storage.

poly(ethylene sodium phosphate) (CH-PEP·Na) complex suspended

1 month.

The BSA–CH-PEP·Na
complexes and native BSA were subjected
to trypsin degradation using a stealth polymer to protect the susceptible
protein cargos from proteolytic attacks. The matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra (Figure 5) confirmed that
native BSA was easily digested by trypsin, generating peptide fragments
(see Table S1); interestingly, the BSA–CH-PEP·Na
(1:10) complex did not exhibit any discernible signals, demonstrating
an excellent stability in the presence of trypsin. The protection
against trypsin digestion was further evaluated by DLS technique as
exhibited in Figure S6. Several polymers,
such as poly(ethylene glycol)monomethyl ether methacrylate-co-poly(nitrophenylcarbonate) (PEGMA-co-PNPC),34 poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(N-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide)
(PEG-b-PHPMA),6 and carbohydrate-b-poly(propylene glycol),35 have
the potential ability to protect encapsulated proteins. Hence, CH-PEP·Na
can be considered as a promising polymeric carrier for protein delivery
and protection under proteolytic conditions.

HAp, a formula of calcium
phosphate (Ca10(PO4)6OH2), is the main mineral portion in teeth
and bones.36 It contains two species of
binding sites, positively charged calcium and negatively charged phosphate
groups. In our previous works, PEP·Na exhibited excellent affinity
for both HAp substrates20,37 and in vivo bones.21 Accordingly, BSA-fluoresce in isothiocyanate
conjugate (FITC-BSA)–CH-PEP·Na complexes were anticipated
to adsorb onto HAp to continue this complex platform for bone-targeting
nanomedicine. HAp was immersed into a FITC-BSA–CH-PEP·Na
suspension for 3 h. As the reference range for albumin concentrations
in human serum is approximately 3.3–5.2 g/dL,38 values between 2.5 and 5.5 g/dL were used in our experiment
to investigate the effect of albumin on the affinity of the complexes
for HAp. The coverage ratio and quantity of the adsorbed complexes
per unit amount of HAp was estimated by comparing the final complex
concentration in the supernatant with that in the original solution
before immersion with HAp. As shown in Figure 6A, both plateau plots of coverage ratio (1.8
to 2.0 × 10–3) and the amount of adsorbed complex
(26.6–28.4 μg/mg HAp) revealed no significant changes
in the values upon increasing the albumin concentration, thus implying
that the FITC-BSA–CH-PEP·Na complexes strongly deposited
on the HAp surface and the albumin could not block the binding avidity
between the complexes and the HAp particles. The uncomplexed FITC-BSA
(Figure 6B), however,
exhibited a decrease in affinity for HAp as the albumin concentration
increased because of the competitive adsorption of that protein. This
phenomenon could be confirmed by the fluorescence micrographs of HAp
treated with FITC-BSA and FITC-BSA–CH-PEP·Na complexes.
The fluorescence signal of FITC-BSA-treated HAp disappeared in the
presence of free albumin, whereas that of the complex-treated HAp
with and without albumin remained steady (see Figure S7). Therapeutic proteins have been recently developed
for bone34,39 and dental40,41 treatments;
because of the various advantages of CH-PEP·Na, our protein–CH-PEP·Na
complexes could be potentially used as biotherapeutic delivery vehicles
with high proteolytic stability for such applications.

concentrations.

Conclusions
In
summary, amphiphilic CH-PEP·Na was used to fabricate protein–polymer
complexes via a method as simple as thermal treatment. This noncovalent
strategy was created by utilizing the hydrophobic attraction between
proteins and cholesteryl appendages. Compared with the other two polyphosphoesters
tested, PEP·Na and CH-PMP, CH-PEP·Na provided a considerably
greater protein stabilization to heat because of its amphiphilicity
and negative charges. The BSA–CH-PEP·Na complexes were
obtained at 90 °C, as verified by DLS and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The CH-PEP·Na chains were able to protect the
complexed proteins in the presence of proteolytic cleavage and excellently
maintain the complex size stability over 1 month. Besides, FITC-BSA–CH-PEP·Na
complexes have a binding affinity for HAp surfaces even in the presence
of free albumin. This work should be further extended on the complexation
of other proteins with CH-PEP·Na for bone and dental treatments.

Experiments
Materials
2-Chloro-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane (COP)
was kindly supplied by NOF Corporation (Japan) and cholesterol was
obtained from Kanto Chemical (Japan). Macro-prep ceramic HAp type
II 40 μm was purchased from Bio-Rad. BSA, FITC-BSA, and Dulbecco’s
PBS was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene
(DBU) was purified by distillation under reduced pressure using a
fraction of bp 130 °C/3.0 mmHg (lit.: bp 80 °C/0.6 mmHg).
2,6-Lutidine was purified by vacuum distillation. The ion exchanger
Amberlite IR-120 (Merck KGaA) was washed with deionized (DI) water
before use. Trimethylamine (TMA) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque.
Water was purified using a Millipore Milli-Q system (resistivity 18.2
MΩ·cm at 25 °C), involving ultraviolet (UV) irradiation,
ion exchange, and filtration. The BSA amount was quantified using
the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). The other reagents
were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical and used without further purification.
MP was synthesized as reported in a previous work.22

Methods
The PPE structure was confirmed
by 1H NMR using a JEOL (Japan) operating at 400 MHz. The
transmittance
at 550 nm of the complex suspensions was recorded with a JASCO V-650
UV–visible light (vis) spectroscope (Japan). The fluorescence
measurements were performed using an F-2500 spectrophotometer (Hitachi,
Japan) to investigate the cmc. The molecular weight of the polymers
was measured with a gel permeation chromatographer and anRI-2031 refractive
index detector (JASCO, Japan). For the analysis of CH-PEP·Na
and PEP·Na, acetate buffer was selected as eluent and PEG standards
(7.5 × 102 to 1.4 × 105 Da) were used
to build a calibration curve, whereas for CH-PMP, chloroform as eluent
and polystyrene standards (2.8 × 103 to 1.3 ×
106 Da) were used. The complex formation was performed
using a UV-2075 UV–vis detector (JASCO, Japan) recorded at
280 nm. A phosphate buffer containing NaCl (0.3 M) was used as the
eluent. DLS was also carried out with a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern
Instruments Ltd., UK) to analyze the average diameter and PDI of the
complexes based on intensity. CD spectra were recorded on a J-1500
CD spectrometer (JASCO, Japan). The secondary structures of the proteins
were investigated in the 200–250 nm wavelength range using
a quartz cuvette; the samples were prepared with PBS (pH 7.4) to obtain
a protein concentration of 2 μM and a scan rate of 100 nm/min
at 37 °C, with 8 accumulation scans, was adopted. The molecular
weight of a complex was carried out by SEC-MALS (TOSOH) with column
(WTC-050S5, Wyatt technology) (Mw range
= 15 000–5 000 000 Da) using two detectors,
a refractive index detector (Optilab T-rEX, Wyatt technology) and
MALS detector (DAWN HELEOS-II, Wyatt technology). Dulbecco’s
PBS was used as a solvent for the complexes and as an eluent for SEC
analysis with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at 30 °C.

Preparation
of PPEs
As shown in Scheme 1, CH-PMP was synthesized via the ROP of MP
(60 mmol, 70 equiv) using cholesterol (0.86 mmol, 1 equiv) and DBU
(0.86 mmol, 1 equiv) as initiator and catalyst, respectively.20,22 The mixture was dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL) and the reaction
was allowed to proceed under an argon atmosphere in an ice bath for
1 h and subsequently stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h. Then,
CH-PMP was purified by reprecipitation in toluene followed by diethyl
ether and dried under vacuum, resulting in a viscous colorless liquid
that was stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C. To prepare CH-PEP·Na,
the purified CH-PMP was further demethylated with TMA (120 mmol, 140
equiv) over 24 h, and then the mixture was stirred with cation exchange
resins twice to replace the quaternized ammonium ions with H+ ones. The polymer was subsequently purified using dialysis against
DI water using a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut-off
(MWCO) of 3500 Da. The so-obtained polymer was neutralized with an
NaOH solution, dialyzed against DI water (MWCO = 3500 Da), and lyophilized
to obtain CH-PEP·Na. PEP·Na was also synthesized as described
for CH-PEP·Na, starting from MP (36 mmol, 70 equiv), methanol
(0.51 mmol, 1 equiv), and DBU (0.51 mmol, 1 equiv). Both pure CH-PEP·Na
and PEP·Na were finally obtained as white solids and stored at
4 °C.

The cmc’s of the cholesterol-containing PPEs
were determined using pyrene as a fluorescence probe, according to
a previously published method.42,43 The concentrations
of the polymer solutions were varied from 2 × 10–5 to 5 mg/mL. A pyrene solution in acetone was added to each sample
and the resulting mixtures were dissolved in PBS. The spectra were
recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer using an excitation
wavelength of 336 nm.

Preparation of BSA–PPE Complexes
BSA (120 μmol,
1 equiv) was dissolved in PBS (1 mL). Each PPE (0 μmol, 0 equiv;
240 μmol, 2 equiv; 600 μmol, 5 equiv; 1200 μmol,
10 equiv) in PBS (1 mL) was prepared separately and then mixed with
the BSA solution, obtaining final BSA concentrations of 60 μM.
The resulting mixtures were heated at 90 °C under stirring for
15 min. The free polymers were removed by centrifugal filtration (MWCO:
50k, Merck Millipore) and the complexes were then re-dispersed in
PBS.

BSA/CH-PEP·Na Ratio Determination in the Complexes
SEC-MALS was conducted to determine the weight-average molecular
weight of the complexes in PBS. The dn/dc value of 0.185 mL/g was used in the molecular weight calculations
processed by ASTRA software. The BSA amount in the complex solution
was then quantified via the BCA assay using the albumin standard curve
(concentration range = 125–2000 μg/mL). The content of
the complexed CH-PEP·Na was calculated according to the following
equation. Both the complex weight and BSA/CH-PEP·Na ratio (by
mol) data were used for estimating the number of protein molecules
to the CH-PEP·Na chain in a complex.  * from the BCA assay.

Stability against Trypsin
Digestion
The enzymatic degradation
study of native and complexed BSA was performed according to a modified
version of a previously published method.34 The samples were 10-fold diluted with acetonitrile (10%) and NaHCO3 (90%) buffer at pH = 8, with a final protein concentration
of 0.40 mg/mL, and then digested with trypsin (trypsin/protein = 1:25)
at 37 °C for 17 h. The MALDI matrix was prepared from a mixture
of acetonitrile, Milli-Q water, and trifluoroacetic acid (50:47.5:2.5)
containing α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/mL). The digested
samples and the matrix were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and spotted on an
Anchor Chip target to undergo fragmental analysis operated by Flex
Control software.

Binding Affinity of FITC-BSA–CH-PEP·Na
Complexes
for Ceramic HAp Surfaces
HAp microparticles (30 mg) were
treated with the FITC-BSA–CH-PEP·Na (1:10, 500 μL)
complex suspension containing different amounts of albumin (0, 2.5,
3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5 g/dL), as a protein model in human
serum, for 3 h. The fluorescence intensity of the centrifuged supernatants
was measured with a spectrophotometer and derived from the initial
value to determine the amount of complex adsorbed onto HAp; the excitation
and emission wavelengths were 495 and 520 nm, respectively. The surface
area coverage ratio is defined as the ratio between the total surface
area of the adsorbed complexes and the HAp surface area.
