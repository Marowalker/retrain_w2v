During the synthesis of gold nanoparticle
(NP) assemblies, the
interfacial charge and hydrophobicity of the primary particles play
a distinguished role. In the present article, we demonstrate that
the association of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) capped gold NPs with
sodium alkyl sulfates provide a powerful route for the manipulation
of these interfacial properties. Dynamic light-scattering, electrophoretic
mobility, UV–vis–near-infrared spectroscopy, nanoparticle
tracking analysis, and transmission electron microscopy measurements
were used to characterize the PEI/surfactant/gold nanoassemblies.
The results indicate the formation of gold NPs surrounded by a PEI/surfactant
shell with composition-dependent charge and hydrophobicity. The mean
size and the aggregation of the nanoassemblies can be fine tuned by
the amount of surfactant bound to the primary gold NPs as well as
by the application of controlled mixing methods. The specific features
of the prepared nanocomposites may be further exploited in next-generation
applications.

Introduction
Gold
nanoparticles (NPs) and their assemblies are promising candidates
in a diversity of fields, including biomedical1−4 or photochemical and optical devices.5−8 In nearly all of these applications, the surface charge and hydrophobicity
of the NPs must be strictly controlled and adjusted. For instance,
the surface charge of gold NPs can seriously affect their cellular
uptake and biodistribution.9,10 Furthermore, the hydrophobic
nature of their surface layer may considerably affect the charge transfer
of the individual NPs.11 In addition, both
parameters crucially affect the interparticle interactions as well
as the formation of self-organized or directed gold assemblies.12−14

Various macromolecules bound onto gold NPs are good candidates
for adjusting charge and hydrophobicity through their functionalization.15 These polymers also provide (electro)steric
stabilization after the nucleation of gold NPs. Recent studies have
revealed that several polymers, such as Pluronic triblock copolymers16,17 or polyamines,18,19 play specific multiple roles
in the synthesis of gold NPs, i.e., they could simultaneously act
as reducing and stabilizing agents.16−19 Thus, stable dispersions of macromolecule-entrapped
noble-metal NPs can be prepared without the need of reducing compounds.

Branched poly(ethyleneimines) (PEIs), in particular, provide an
economic alternative for the synthesis of dendrimer capped gold NPs
due their low cost and commercial availability.20−23 In this case, a mild reduction
of gold(III) ions occurs with a pronounced role of the secondary amine
groups. The reduction and nucleation processes result in either single
NPs20,21 or supraparticles embedded in the PEI matrix.22,23 In addition, functionalized branched PEI molecules have also been
applied recently for the synthesis of gold NPs with promising properties.
PEGylated PEI-entrapped gold NPs, for instance, were utilized for
computed tomography imaging and polymerase chain reactions.24,25 It was also shown that the functionalization of amine groups with
alkyl chains or maltose units could significantly affect the morphology
of gold NPs, including the appearance of anisometric nanohybrids.26,27

In principle, an alternative of surface functionalization
may be
provided using the association of surfactants with polymer-entrapped
noble-metal nanoparticles. Earlier studies revealed that the nonequilibrium
polyelectrolyte (PE)/surfactant (S) association can be tuned to prepare
PE/S NPs with controlled size, structure, and chemistry via the adequate
choice of the oppositely charged components as well as of the co-associating
materials.28−35 Specifically, it was shown that through the application of well-defined
preparation methods, stable polyamine/anionic surfactant nanophases28−30 or nanolayers36,37 of variable size, charge, structure,
and hydrophobicity can be produced.

In the present article,
the association of PEI-entrapped gold NPs
with sodium alkyl sulfates will be explored using dynamic light-scattering
(DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), electrophoretic mobility,
UV–vis–near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first systematic study of the direct application of PE/S
complexation for the preparation of noble-metal nanohybrids with tunable
properties. We will demonstrate that via the controlled addition and
mixing with anionic surfactants, the charge and hydrophobicity of
the PEI-capped gold NPs and their interparticle interactions can be
adequately adjusted, resulting in the formation of bulk and solid
gold nanocomposites.

Results and Discussion
PEI-Capped Gold NPs
Earlier studies revealed the formation
of quasi-spherical gold NPs as a result of the mild reduction and
stabilizing effects of hyperbranched PEI molecules. However, the reported
size distributions are controversial with respect to the role of absolute
concentrations and ratio of Au(III) ions and ethyleneimine (EI) monomers.20−23 In this work, the final concentrations of these components are fixed
at 1.2 mM EI and 0.2 mM HAuCl4, in agreement with refs (18) and (20), to ensure optimal conditions
for the detection of the nucleation of gold NPs but to avoid the large
excess of free PEI molecules. The variation in the UV–vis spectra
of the PEI–Au systems with time in Figure S1 clearly indicates that the reduction of gold(III) ions is
a slow process at room temperature, in agreement with earlier studies.
However, a much faster and reproducible way of PEI-capped gold NP
synthesis was achieved after 2 h of incubation at 80 °C.

As shown in Figure 1 (left), the spectrum of the pretreated gold NP dispersions becomes
time independent after the thermal pretreatment, and its shape is
consistent with the formation of quasi-spherical particles. The polydispersity
of the formed NPs is significant, and their mean diameters were found
to be 20 ± 2 nm by DLS and 12 ± 4 nm by TEM (Figure 1 (right)). The observed localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band maximum at λ = 519 nm
is in reasonable agreement with the diameter values predicted by the
Mie theory or observed in aqueous medium.38

at pH = 4 after 2 h pretreatment at 80 °C, followed
by measurements at 25 °C (left). TEM pictures of the prepared
gold NPs (right). It should be noted that the agglomeration of individual
positively charged NPs shown in the picture is not the consequence
of bulk assembly formation but due to their aggregation on the negatively
charged carbon grid during TEM sample preparation.

PEI/Surfactant/Gold Nanoassemblies
The complexation
of PEI–Au NPs with anionic surfactants was investigated for
mixtures, which were prepared through the application of the so-called
rapid- and slow-mixing procedures33,34 developed
earlier for the controlled preparation of oppositely charged PE/S
systems. The photos in Figure 2a reveal a remarkable difference in some of the samples prepared
via the two preparation methods. During the application of rapid-mixing
procedure, precipitates are formed at intermediate STDS concentrations,
whereas transparent (rosy) gold nanosystems are observable at larger
or smaller surfactant concentrations. In the case of slow-mixing procedure,
however, opalescent systems are formed over a wide composition range
(i.e., above a certain sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STDS) concentration,
≅0.3 mM) indicating the formation of large aggregates. Similar
effect of the mixing methods was also observed for PEI–Au/sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) systems.

Figure 2 (a) Photos of PEI–Au/STDS mixtures
prepared by the slow-
(top) and rapid-mixing (bottom) methods. The concentration of STDS
increases from left to right. Time dependence of the absorbance (at
λ = 524 nm) vs surfactant concentration curves of (b) PEI–Au/STDS
and (c) PEI–Au/SDS gold nanosystems made by the rapid-mixing
protocol. All of the mixtures were prepared from the PEI–Au
NPs, synthesized by the 2 h of thermal pretreatment at 80 °C.

In the light of these findings,
the rapid-mixing protocol was utilized
primarily to synthesize gold nanohybrids in the following part of
our work. The association between the PEI-entrapped gold NPs and the
alkyl sulfates is completed within a couple of hours, as demonstrated
by the absorbance (at λ = 524 nm) vs surfactant concentration
curves in Figure 2b,c,
except the intermediate surfactant concentration range, where slow
aggregation of the NPs occurs.

Characteristic examples for the
time dependence of the whole UV–vis
spectra of PEI–Au/STDS and PEI–Au/SDS systems are shown
in Figure S2a,b, respectively.

The
mean mobility and the apparent mean hydrodynamic diameter of
the bulk nanocomposites against the surfactant concentration is plotted
in Figure 3a,b, for
STDS and SDS containing nanoassemblies, respectively, prepared by
rapid-mixing method. Several examples for the monomodal size distributions
of the nanoassemblies, determined by DLS, are shown in Figure S3.

Figure 3 (a, b) Variation in the mean electrophoretic
mobility (uς) and the apparent mean
diameter (dH) with the surfactant concentration
of PEI–Au/STDS
and PEI–Au/SDS nanoassemblies, respectively, prepared through
the rapid-mixing protocol. The dH values
were determined by the DLS (red symbols) and the NTA techniques (black
symbols) as well. (c, d) Surfactant concentration dependence of the
UV–vis spectra of the same systems as in (a) and (b). (e, f)
TEM pictures of PEI–Au/STDS nanocomposites, prepared via rapid-mixing
method at 0.41 and 2.0 mM STDS concentrations, respectively.

The net positive charge of the
nanohybrids decreases, whereas their
size increases with increasing surfactant concentration up to the
appearance of precipitation. The charge neutralization surfactant
concentration is smaller for STDS (0.3 mM) than for SDS (0.45 mM)
due to the higher driving force of STDS binding on the PEI molecules.
A further increase in the surfactant concentration leads to charge
reversal and decrease in the size of the nanoassemblies, which levels
off in the vicinity of the bulk critical micelle concentration (cmc)
of the amphiphiles. As indicated inFigure S4, the mean size of the bulk gold nanoassemblies is not dependent
on the time within the experimental error over a wide concentration
range, as checked by DLS for 2 weeks (except in the vicinity of charge
neutralization where slow aggregation is observable).

At two
selected initial compositions, the mean Stokes diameters
were also determined from NTA measurements in the concentration range
of surfactant excess. As shown in Figure 3a,b, the dH values
from NTA to DLS are in good agreement. Furthermore, the three-dimensional
representation of the particle concentration vs scattered intensity
and Stokes diameter functions (Figures S6 and S7) unambiguously reveals the existence of only one population
of gold nanoassemblies (i.e., the negligible amount of free PEI/surfactant
complexes not bound to the primary gold NPs).

The variation
in the mean size of the gold NPs with sodium alkyl
sulfate concentration correlates qualitatively with the observed small
blue shift at low and the slight red shift at high surfactant concentrations,
as shown by the UV–vis spectra in Figure 3c,d, respectively. The lack of additional
absorbance peaks in the near IR regime (see also Figure S5 in the SI) is consistent with the quasi-spherical
shape of the particles. The enhanced absorbance compared to the bare
gold NPs is mainly attributable to the aggregation of the primary
gold NPs coated with PEI/surfactant layers into larger assemblies
with positive or negative net charge (an example is given in Figure 3e). On the other
hand, the significantly reduced absorbance and the slight red shift
of the LSPR band maximum at the bulk cmc of SDS and STDS (521 nm compared
to 519 nm of the PEI-capped gold NPs) suggest the formation of individual,
overcharged gold NPs at these compositions. This is also consistent
with the TEM picture in Figure 3f as well as with the similar Stokes diameters measured at
the cmc (25 ± 2 nm) and in the absence of surfactant (20 ±
2 nm).

Figure 4 shows the
comparison of the mean Stokes diameters and UV–vis spectra
of the PEI–Au/STDS nanocomposite dispersions made by the two
types of mixing protocols at the same compositions. The graphs clearly
reveal that, in contrast to rapid-mixing methods, the major consequence
of the application of slow-mixing method is manifested in the formation
of large aggregates of gold NPs over a wide concentration range of
surfactant excess, in agreement with Figure S8 and the visual appearance of the samples in Figure 2a as well. However, the observed spectra
and the measured dH values did not reveal
any time dependence for 2 weeks within the experimental error.

Figure 4 Comparison
of the apparent mean diameter vs surfactant concentration
curves (left) and the UV–vis spectra (right) of PEI–Au/STDS
mixtures prepared via the slow- and rapid-mixing protocols, respectively,
at surfactant excess.

The interpretation of our observations is summarized in Figure 5. The PEI-capped
gold NPs are positively charged due to the excess protonated amine
groups of the polymer. We speculate that essentially the charged primary
amine groups provide the electrostatic stabilization of the hyperbranched
PEI-entrapped gold NPs because the secondary amine groups provide
the strongest reduction capability.39 This
is also supported qualitatively by the amounts of surfactant bound
onto the PEI-capped NPs, which can be estimated as 0.2 and 0.35 mM
for SDS and STDS, respectively, at zero mobility of the gold nanohybrids
(assuming similarly low (≤0.1 mM) equilibrium free surfactant
concentration under these conditions as in the case of bulk PEI/SDS
complexes with uς = 0).40 These values are roughly commensurable with
the primary amine group concentration of PEI.

Figure 5 Schematic representation
of the assembly formation of PEI-capped
gold NPs due to their interaction with anionic surfactant molecules
upon application of the rapid- and slow-mixing protocols.

With increasing surfactant concentration, the binding
of the alkyl
sulfate ions to the amine groups compensate the positive net charge
of the PEI–Au NPs, leading to decrease in charge and increase
in hydrophobicity of their external layer (similarly to the formation
of compact hydrophobic PEI/SDS layers on silica or mica36,37). This leads to an increase in the mean size of the nanocomposites
due to the aggregation of the gold NPs surrounded by the hydrophobic
polyelectrolyte/surfactant layers, and then solid precipitates are
observable at intermediate surfactant concentrations. At even higher
surfactant concentrations, the alkyl sulfate ions may bind onto the
neutralized hydrophobic PEI/alkyl sulfate layer of the gold NPs similarly
to the PEI/SDS-coated silica or mica surfaces in refs (36) and (37).

This adsorption
process results in the charge reversal of the gold
nanoassemblies and could prevent their coagulation at larger STDS
or SDS concentrations, provided that the rapid-mixing protocol was
used for the preparation of the nanocomposites.

This phenomenon
is analogous with the electrostatic stabilizing
mechanisms of hydrophobic PEI/SDS NP dispersions made by the rapid-mixing
procedure at surfactant excess and the observed impact of solution
preparation methods on these systems.30,34,35 During the rapid-mixing process, the equilibrium
free surfactant concentration and thus the corresponding excess charge
of the NPs—due to the adsorbed surfactant ions—are achieved
relatively quickly at high surfactant concentrations. Therefore, the
overcharged gold nanoassemblies are not destabilized as a result of
the initial concentration gradients, but remain stable, as demonstrated
by the scheme in Figure 5 and in the TEM photograph in Figure 3f. In contrast, during slow-mixing method, the surfactant
is gradually dripped into the PEI-capped gold NP dispersion. This
prevents the completion of the surfactant ion adsorption on the surface
of the neutralized NPs before their irreversible coagulation into
larger agglomerates occurs.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have shown that branched PEI molecules can not
only be used for the entrapment and stabilization of gold NPs, but
their association with anionic surfactants can be utilized in the
synthesis of nanohybrids with polyamine/surfactant shell around the
gold core. The charge and hydrophobicity of this layer as well as
the interparticle interactions of the NPs can be adequately adjusted
through the variation in polymer/surfactant ratios, provided that
the well-defined rapid-mixing method is used. It was demonstrated
that only this preparation method provides the stable dispersion of
small, negatively charged gold nanohybrids with reproducible mean
size. These findings may be further utilized for the controlled synthesis
of aqueous dispersions and solid assemblies of noble-metal NPs with
hierarchical structure and tunable properties. Finally, the synthesis
of biosurfactant/polymer-coated NPs in the future may lead to novel
nanocomposites with potential biomedical applications.

Methods
Materials
The sodium dodecyl sulfate and sodium tetradecyl
sulfate (SDS and STDS, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98.0%) samples were
recrystallized twice from ethanol. The cmc of SDS and STDS in water
was found to be 8.1 and 1.9 mM, respectively, at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C
from conductivity measurements. The branched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI,
Sigma-Aldrich) sample had a mass averaged molar mass of 25 kDa, with
an approximate 1:2:1 ratio of the primary, secondary, and tertiary
amine groups.28 Ultrapure water (Milli-Q)
was used for the preparation of the solutions.

Solution Preparation Methods
The aqueous solutions
of HAuCl4 was added to poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) solutions
to prepare a 20 mL mixture under continuous stirring with a magnetic
stirrer (1800 rpm). The final ethyleneimine (EI) monomer and HAuCl4 concentrations were 1.2 and 0.2 mM, respectively, resulting
in a mixture with pH ≈ 4. In the preliminary experiments, these
mixtures were stored at room temperature and analyzed by UV–vis
spectroscopy for a week. However, to achieve reproducible results
and faster equilibration with the added surfactants, in the majority
of the experiments, the mixtures were pretreated at 80°C for
2 h (immediately after their preparation at room temperature). The
as-prepared gold colloids were stored at t = 25.0
± 0.5 °C and used for further experiments within 1 day.
For the synthesis of PEI–Au/surfactant nanocomposites, two
types of mixing methods, developed earlier for PE/S systems,33,34 were used. During the so-called rapid-mixing33,34 method, equal volumes (1.5 mL) of SDS or STDS solution (at double
their intended final concentration) and PEI-capped gold NP dispersion
were quickly mixed under continuous stirring with a magnetic stirrer
(1800 rpm). In the case of slow-mixing method,34,35 the surfactant solution was added slowly, drop-by-drop, to the PEI–Au
dispersion of equal volume (1.5 mL) under continuous stirring with
a magnetic stirrer. All of the mixtures were made and stored at t = 25.0 ± 0.5 °C.

UV–Vis–NIR
Spectroscopy
The formation
of gold nanoparticles was monitored by observing changes in the absorption
spectra at 25 °C. A Perkin-Elmer Lambda 1050 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer
was used to record the spectra in the 320–1000 nm wavelength
interval with a path length of 1.00 cm. Because the detected absorbance
values were negligible in the near-IR region (see Figure S5 of the SI), the major part of the measurements was
carried out only in the UV–vis range of the spectra.

Electrophoretic
Mobility Measurements
The mean electrophoretic
mobility (uζ) of the gold/polymer/surfactant
nanocomposites was determined at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C, immediately
after solution preparation, using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZSP instrument.
The apparatus utilizes the M3-PALS technique to determine the mean
velocity of the PE/S complexes (vE) at
a given electric field strength (E), from the measured
frequency shift of the scattered light due to the movement of the
particles. The mean mobility values are derived from the uζ = vE/E relationship. In the case of the transparent systems, the measurements
were repeated after 24 h, but no deviations from the previously measured
data were found within the experimental error.

Dynamic Light-Scattering
(DLS) Measurements
The mean
hydrodynamic size of the polyelectrolyte/surfactant complexes was
determined by dynamic light-scattering (DLS). The experimental setup
(Brookhaven Instruments) consisted of a BI-200SM goniometer system
and a BI-9000 AT digital correlator using a Genesis MX488-1000 OPS
laser (1 W). The measurements were carried out at λ = 488 nm
wavelength, θ = 90° scattering angle, and at 25.0 ±
0.1 °C for 24 h, as well as 2 weeks after the preparation of
the systems. The CONTIN analysis of the normalized electric field
autocorrelation functions revealed wide unimodal distributions of
the nanocomposites in the investigated composition range. The apparent
mean diffusion coefficient of the particles (Dapp) was derived from the second-order cumulant analysis of
the autocorrelation function and their apparent mean hydrodynamic
diameter (dH) was calculated on the basis
of the Einstein–Stokes relation: , where T is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, η is the viscosity of
the medium, and dH is the diameter of
the particle. Occasionally, the Stokes diameters were also determined
from the DLS measurements carried out at θ = 175° scattering
angle by the backscattering utility of the previously described Malvern
Zetasizer Nano ZSP instrument using a 10 mW He–Ne laser at
λ = 633 nm. In the investigated transparent concentration range,
the observed dH values were not dependent
on the type of the applied DLS setups. The turbid concentration range
was only monitored by the backscattering method because this technique
considerably suppresses the effect of multiple scattering.

Nanoparticle
Tracking Analysis (NTA)
For the determination
of the mean size of the nanocomposites, the NTA technology (Nanosight
LM10) was also applied. Prior to injecting the gold NP dispersions,
the cell was cleaned by isopropyl alcohol and dried by high-purity
nitrogen jet. A laser beam (40 mW, at λ = 642 nm) was passed
through the sample chamber and the motion of the particles in the
path of this beam was visualized using a microscope with a charge-coupled
device camera, operating at 30 frames/s. The videos were analyzed
using the NTA 3.1 software and the apparent diffusion coefficient
of the individual particles was calculated from their mean square
displacement, : , where x and y are the two-dimensional coordinates and t is the
time of particle tracking. The apparent diameter of the individual
particles was calculated according to the Einstein–Stokes equation.
A unique feature of the NTA technique is that the scattered intensity
and the size of the particles can be determined independently, and
thus nanoparticles with largely different refractive indices could
be distinguished. It should be noted, however, that no information
about the shape and structure of the particles can be resolved by
the NTA method in the investigated nanoscale range. In addition, accurate
tracking of the particles is only possible for very dilute nanosystems
with typical concentrations between 106 and 1010 particles/cm3. Therefore, the gold nanocomposite dispersion
was diluted 100-fold with polymer free surfactant solution of
the same analytical SDS or STDS concentration than that of the dispersion.
These diluted systems were filtered through 0.22 μm membrane
filters before the measurements.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
The diluted
NPs were drop-dried on carbon-coated microgrids for the TEM study.
A Philips CM 20 (200 kV) microscope was used for the conventional
electron microscopy (bright field and dark field images), whereas
a JEOL 3010 (300 kV, point resolution: 0.17 nm) equipped with Gatan
Tridiem electron energy loss spectroscopy was used for high-resolution
TEM investigations.
