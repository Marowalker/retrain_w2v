β-Galactosidase (β-gal)
is one of the important lysosomal
enzymes that is involved in the breakdown of glycosphingolipids (e.g.,
GM1 ganglioside), and its deficiency leads to GM1 Gangliosidosis,
a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). Intracellular delivery of β-gal
is one of the preferable methods to treat this kind of LSDs. However,
it cannot permeate the cell membrane due to its intricate macromolecular
nature, low stability, and degradation by endogenous proteases. To
this end, we report efficient intracellular delivery of β-gal
via arginase-responsive dextran sulfate/poly-l-arginine polymer
capsules (DS/PA capsules). The therapeutic activity of β-gal
enzyme has been assessed in two gene-deficient diseased cell lines,
SV (β-galactosidase gene-deficient mouse fibroblast) and R201C
(deficient human β-galactosidase gene-introduced mouse fibroblast),
and in wild-type mouse fibroblast immortalized cell lines. The activity
of β-gal enzyme has been estimated within cells by using fluorescein
isothiocyanate-cholera toxin B as a florescent probe that illustrates
the level of GM1 ganglioside, the β-gal substrate. We found
1.8-, 3.4-, and 2.8-fold reduction in the substrate level in R201C,
SV, and wild-type mouse fibroblast, respectively, which confirms the
release and therapeutic activity of β-gal enzyme inside the
cells. Moreover, enzyme delivery in gene-deficient diseased cell lines
(SV and R201C) via DS/PA capsules reduced the level of enzyme substrate
to a normal endogenous level, which is present in untreated wild-type
mouse fibroblast cells. We note that loading of β-gal enzyme
within DS/PA capsules was estimated to be 3 mU per hundred capsules
and more than 77% of β-gal is released within 12 h. Overall,
these results highlight the potential of DS/PA capsules as an efficient
delivery carrier for therapeutic enzyme.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Lysosomes
are cell compartments, responsible for catabolism of
endogenous and exogenous macromolecules and recycle them. More than
50 digestive enzymes are involved in cellular waste disposal by breakdown
of all kinds of biomolecules. β-Galactosidase (β-gal)
is one of lysosomal enzymes that is involved in the breakdown of glycosphingolipid
(e.g., GM1 ganglioside) and its deficiency leads to GM1 gangliosidosis,
lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) that results in progressive destruction
of the central nervous system (CNS).1−3 This can even lead to
the death of the person due to permanent cellular and tissue damage.
Several strategies have been used in the past to treat LSDs, such
as the substrate reduction therapy that reduces biosynthesis of the
substrate for correction of the imbalance between formation and breakdown
of the substrate (can affect the cellular substrate balance),4−6 pharmacological chaperones therapy that stabilizes mutant lysosomal
proteins (limited to selective patients with mutant lysosomal enzyme
LSDs or chaperone responsive mutations),7−13 bone marrow transplant (challenges in identifying compatible donors,
high morbidity, graft failure, and mortality),14gene delivery (challenges in obtaining adequate levels of
gene product in specific tissues like CNS, maintaining in vivo expression,
random integration, and immune reactions),15−17 cell-penetrating
peptides (short circulating half-life in vivo),18 and DNA-mediated enzyme delivery (in vivo stability).19 Most of the above approaches are limited due
to presence of inherent complexities, which are mentioned above within
the parenthesis of the corresponding therapy. Presently, the most
promising approach to treat LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT),
in which the missing enzyme is replaced by intravenous infusion. Although
ERT is commercially available currently, it is limited to six lysosomal
enzyme therapies.20,21 Thus, it is essential to design
suitable delivery vehicles that can translocate lysosmal enzymes inside
the cell. In this regard, few attempts have been made to deliver β-gal
enzyme using different vehicles, such as lipid vesicles(liposome),22 polymeric nanoparticles,23 protein nanoparticles,24 cyclodextrin,25 functionalized gold nanoparticles,26 and polymersome.27 However, these approaches suffer from the following challenges,
such as low encapsulation efficiency, reduction in activity, formation of undesirable
degradation products, etc.

Herein, we report efficient intracellular
delivery of β-gal
enzyme via dextran sulfate and poly-l-arginine polymeric
capsules prepared by layer-by-layer assembly for GM1 gangliosidosis
management. The current approach has the following advantages: (1)
good enzyme loading (3 mU/100 capsules),28 (2) retention of enzyme activity due to mild capsule synthesis conditions,29 (3) enhanced cellular uptake of enzyme as compared
to that of the free enzyme, (4) protection of the encapsulated enzyme
by the LbL polymeric shell from the endogenous proteases inactivation
and immunological reactions due to shielding,30,31 (5) biodegradability due to arginase enzyme response capability,32 and (6) reduced cytotoxicity.

Enzyme-loaded
polymeric capsules were synthesized by the sequential
adsorption of oppositely charged polymers, dextran sulfate (anionic
polyelectrolyte), and poly-l-arginine (cationic polyelectrolyte)
on β-gal enzyme-preloaded calcium carbonate, followed by the
removal of the sacrificial calcium carbonate template by using ethylene
glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)NNN′N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The therapeutic activity of β-gal
has been evaluated in SV (β-galactosidase gene-deficient mouse
fibroblast), R201C (deficient human β-galactosidase gene-introduced
mouse fibroblast), and wild-type mouse fibroblast. To mark curative
activity of the β-gal enzyme, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-cholera
toxin, a florescent probe, has been used to illustrate the level of
the substrate. The decrease in the substrate level within gene-deficient
fibroblast (SV and R201C) as well as wild-type mouse fibroblast confirms
the release (77%) and therapeutic activity of the β-gal enzyme
inside the cells after delivery of β-gal-DS/PA capsules. Our
studies reveal that the bare DS/PA capsules showed no in vitro cytotoxicity
and were efficiently taken up by SV, R201C, wild-type mouse fibroblast,
and HeLa cells.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Synthesis of β-Gal-Loaded
DS/PA Polymeric
Capsules
The synthesis of β-gal-loaded DS/PA capsules
was carried out by sequential layer-by-layer assembly of dextran sulfate
and poly-l-arginine on β-gal-loaded calcium carbonate
templates, followed by core removal. The synthesis of the calcium
carbonate (CaCO3) template was done as previously reported.33,34 Briefly, 1 M calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2·2H2O) was added to 1 M sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) under vigorous stirring for 1 min and was left undisturbed
for 20 min. The particles were separated by centrifugation at 3000
rpm for 3 min, washed thrice with deionized water and acetone, followed
by drying by heating at 80 °C. Further, β-gal loading was
done by dispersing calcium carbonate templates (20 mg) in the β-gal
enzyme (8 U/mL in Z buffer) overnight at 4 °C, followed by separation
at 3000 rpm for 3 min. The enzyme-loaded calcium carbonate template
was sequentially coated with polyanionic and polycationic polymer
solution, as reported by De Geest et al.35,36 Layer-by-layer polymer coating was initiated by addition of dextran
sulfate (1 mL, 1 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl) polymer to β-gal-loaded
calcium carbonate particles (20 mg). This was kept in rotospin for
15 min. The adsorption step was followed by washing of the sample
thrice with deionized water to remove unbound polymer. The separation
of the sample was done at 3000 rpm for 3 min. Subsequently, seven
alternate polymeric layers were made of poly-l-arginine (1
mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl) and dextran sulfate (1 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl) to
form eight layers with alternate negative and positive charges. Finally,
removal of the calcium carbonate template was carried out by using
0.2 M EGTA (7.5 pH) solution. The pH of EGTA solution was adjusted
by using NaOH solution. The prepared capsules were mixed with 0.2
M EGTA (7.5 pH) solution for 5 min. This process was repeated four
times; each time fresh EGTA solution was added, followed by three
times of washing with deionized water. The prepared β-gal-DS/PA
capsules were dispersed in 1 mL of deionized water. Bare DS/PA capsules
were prepared without loading β-gal enzyme as the negative control.

2.2.2 Synthesis of β-Gal-Loaded PSS/PAH
Polymeric Capsules
The synthesis of β-gal-loaded PSS/PAH
capsules was carried out by a sequential layer-by-layer assembly of
poly(sodium 4-styrene-sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride)
(PAH) on β-gal-loaded 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES)-functionalized
silica templates, followed by removal of the silica core. Silica particles
were prepared by Stober’s37 method
by hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (4.7 mL) using ammonia (54.4
mL) in a solution of water (2 mL) and ethanol (50 mL). The particles
were separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water followed
by ethanol to remove the excess of reactants, and dried at 80 °C
overnight. Further, for APTES functionalization,38 silica nanoparticles (600 mg) were sonicated in toluene
(106.5 mL) for 20 min and kept for reflux for 24 h after adding 460
μL of 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) at 130 °C.
APTES-functionalized silica nanoparticles were separated at 3900 rpm
for 3 min and washed twice with toluene and with methanol. Drying
was done by heating at 80 °C for 16 h. β-Gal enzyme loading
was done using the same protocol as that in the case of DS/PA capsules
(Section 2.2.1).
A layer-by-layer polymer assembly was started with the addition of
poly(sodium 4-styrene-sulfonate) (PSS) (1 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl) to
enzyme-loaded APTES-functionalized silica nanoparticles (10 mg), and
the mixture was kept on rotospin for 15 min. This adsorption step
was followed by washing thrice the sample with 0.5 M NaCl to remove
unbound polymer. Separation of the sample was done at 3900 rpm for
3 min. Subsequently, seven alternate polymeric layers were made of
poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) (1 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl) and PSS
(1 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl) to form eight layers with alternate negative
and positive charges. Finally, removal of the silica template was
done using HF buffer (0.75 M HF/4 M NH4F). (Caution: HF
is very toxic and should be handled with all precautions mentioned
in Material Safety Data Sheet.) Centrifugation was performed at 8000
rpm for 3 min, followed by five times washing with deionized water.
The prepared β-gal-PSS/PAH capsules were dispersed in 1 mL of
deionized water.

2.2.3 Estimation of β-Gal
Loading in Polymeric
Capsules
To estimate β-gal enzyme entrapment within
capsules, first, the percent enzyme retained on the template was analyzed.
After a layer-by-layer synthesis, β-gal enzyme entrapment in
polymeric capsules was quantified by mixing an equal volume of polymeric
capsules and double strength o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay buffer using β-galactosidase
detection kit (GAL-A) for an hour. The mixture was ultasonicated for
15 min, followed by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 10 min
at 4 °C. Quantification of β-gal was done as per the protocol
provided by the manufacturer.

2.3 Cell
Culture Studies
Cell culture
studies were done on SV (β-galactosidase gene-deficient mouse
fibroblast) and R201C (deficient human β-gal introduced fibroblast,
KO mouse-derived SV cells). L929 cell lines were used as wild-type
mouse fibroblast as negative control. SV and R201C cells were cultured
in low glucose DMEM medium, whereas HeLa and wild-type mouse fibroblast
were cultured in medium-to-high glucose DMEM medium supplemented with
FBS (10% v/v) and penicillin–streptomycin (1% v/v). All of
the cells were grown in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37 °C.

2.3.1 Cytotoxicity and Capsule Uptake Studies
of DS/PA Polymeric Capsules
The cytotoxicity of DS/PA capsules
was studied on four cell lines (SV, R201C, wild-type mouse fibroblast,
and HeLa) using MTT assay. For MTT assay, approximately 104 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate in DMEM (100 μL)
and rested for 6 h. After 6 h, different concentrations of DS/PA capsules
(0, 25, 50, and 100 capsules/cell) were added to wells of a 96-well
plate. After incubation for 18 h, the medium was removed and MTT dye
(0.5 mg/mL) was added followed by incubation of 4 h. After 4 h, MTT
dye was removed followed by addition of DMSO (200 μL). The optical
density of each sample was analyzed at 570 nm using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer. All samples were taken in triplicates.

For
capsule uptake studies, post-labeled DS/PA capsules with RITC were
used to observe their localization inside the cells. DS/PA capsules
were incubated overnight with RITC dye solution at 4 °C for RITC
labeling. Nearly, 104 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate
containing 13 mm gelatin (0.2% w/v)-coated coverslips. RITC-labeled
DS/PA capsules (50 capsules/cell) were added to each well and incubated
for 12 h in an incubator. After incubation, the medium was discarded
and cells were washed thrice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
to remove free uninternalized capsules. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde
solution, and nuclei were stained using DAPI (10 μg/mL) for
10 min. Staining protocols were used as provided by the manufacturer.
These samples were mounted on glass slides and observed under a confocal
laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).

2.3.2 In
Vitro Enzyme Release Studies
First, to observe β-gal
release from DS/PA capsules within
HeLa cells, approximately 104 HeLa cells were seeded in
a 24 well plate containing 13 mm gelatin coated coverslip and incubate
for 6 h. After 6 h incubation, β-gal-loaded DS/PA capsules (3
mU) were dispersed in media and added to a cell culture plate. Cells
were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for different
time periods (0, 6, 12, and 24 h). Thereafter, the medium was removed
and cells were washed thrice with PBS to remove free uninternalized
capsules. Cells were incubated with ONPG buffer for 1 h. Subsequent
to this, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 20 min,
mounted on glass slides, and observed under a confocal laser scanning
microscope. Cells were quantified for yellow fluorescence produced
by o-nitrophenol (ONP) using Image J software.

In the second set of experiments, in vitro β-gal release from
β-gal-loaded DS/PA capsules was analyzed in HeLa cell lysate
after 4, 6, 12, and 24 h time point. Around 104 HeLa cells
were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated for 6 h. After 6 h incubation,
β-gal-loaded DS/PA capsules (3 mU) were dispersed in media and
added into a 96-well plate and allowed to incubate at different time
points in the CO2 incubator. Thereafter, the medium was
removed and cells were washed thrice with PBS to remove free uninternalized
capsules. Cells in the cell culture plate were trypsinized and washed
with PBS. Cell lysis was done by incubating these cells in ice-cold
lysis buffer for 30 min, and the cell lysate was collected by centrifugation
at 14 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Quantification of β-gal
in cell lysate was done by β-galactosidase detection kit using
protocol provided by the manufacturers. Further, similar release studies
(12 h time point) were done with nondegradable PSS/PAH capsules as
the control experiment.

2.3.3 Enzyme Activity Studies
Therapeutic
activity of the β-gal enzyme, after delivering β-gal-loaded
DS/PA capsules inside the cells, was evaluated in SV, R201C, and wild-type
mouse fibroblast cell lines. For enzyme activity studies, about 104 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate containing 13 mm gelatin
(0.2% w/v)-coated coverslips and were rested for 6 h. After 6 h of
incubation, cells were treated with two different concentrations of
β-gal-loaded DS/PA capsules (50 capsules/cell, 1.5 mU and 100
capsules/cell, 3 mU). In a separate set of experiments, cells were
treated with free β-gal enzyme (1.5 and 3 mU) equivalent to
the β-gal-loaded in DS/PA capsules as a control. A negative
control was also taken in which cells were treated with bare DS/PA
capsules (50 and 100 capsules/cell). Cells were incubated at 37 °C
under 5% CO2 for different time points (0, 6, 12, and 24
h). Afterward, the medium was removed and cells were washed thrice
with PBS to remove free uninternalized capsules. FITC-cholera toxin
B (0.75 μg/mL) in DMEM was added to cell culture plates and
incubated for 2 h followed by washing thrice with PBS. After this,
cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 20 min, mounted
on glass slides, and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope.

2.4 Characterization of Polymeric Capsule
The morphology of the samples was acquired from a scanning electron
microscope and transmission electron microscope. Layer-by-layer (LBL)
polymeric capsules were analyzed for zeta potential values and particle
size using dynamic light scattering (DLS) by Malvern zeta sizer. Confirmation
of β-gal enzyme loading and quantification of the enzyme in
β-gal-DS/PA and β-gal-PSS/PAH were carried out by using
ONPG, an artificial β-gal substrate, provided by Sigma GAL-A,
β-Galactosidase detection kit. Thermo Scientific Multiskan UV–vis
spectrophotometer was used for measuring absorbance at 570 nm for
MTT assay. For localization of capsules in cells and to mark a substrate level inside the cells,
imaging was done by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Carl Zeiss
LSM 710).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization
Scheme 1 demonstrates the
synthesis of β-gal-loaded DS/PA polymeric capsules prepared
by the sacrificial template method35,36 that consists
of the following steps: (a) synthesis of CaCO3 template,
(b) loading of β-gal enzyme on CaCO3 template, (c)
sequential adsorption of oppositely charged dextran sulfate and poly-l-arginine polymer on CaCO3 template to form a layer-by-layer
assembly, and (d) removal of the template by EGTA solution.

Scheme 1 Schematic
Illustration of β-Gal-Loaded DS/PA Polymeric Capsule
Synthesis
We note that the porous
and rough surface of CaCO3 template
facilitates the loading of β-gal (240 mU/mg). Moreover, the
positive surface potential of CaCO3 template (zeta potential
+7 mV, in water at pH 7) facilitates the electrostatic deposition
of dextran sulfate, a negatively charged polymer, as the first layer,
followed by deposition of poly-l-arginine as the second layer.
This process was repeated to attain eight layers, which makes the
capsules structurally stable to prevent the leakage of the enzyme
from the capsules. We also note that EGTA is explicitly used as a
chelating agent instead of disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)
to dissolve the calcium carbonate template. For the activity of β-gal
enzyme over ONPG, an artificial substrate, the presence of Mg++ and Na+ ions is essential, as these ions act
as enzyme activators. EGTA preferentially binds with calcium ions
(Ca++) and at the same time does not sequester Mg++ ions. Hence, it does not cause inactivation of β-gal enzyme,
whereas EDTA sequesters Mg++ ions along with Ca++ ions and causes β-gal enzyme inactivation.39,40

The size and surface morphology of DS/PA capsules were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). The SEM image of the CaCO3 template (Figure S1a) clearly shows that the particles
are porous with a rough surface. The size of the CaCO3 templates
and DS/PA capsules is in the range of 1–3 μm which is
further supported by DLS measurements (Figures S2 and S3). To substantiate the sequential adsorption of oppositely
charged polymer on CaCO3 template, the LBL assembly was
further characterized by zeta potential measurements. Alteration in
the surface potential of the CaCO3 template (Figure S4) from positive to negative after each consecutive layer formation verifies the sequential adsorption
of oppositely charged polymer. SEM (Figure 1a) and TEM (Figure 1b) images of DS/PA capsules also confirm
the formation of capsules with size ranging from 1 to 3 μm.

Figure 1 (a) SEM
image of DS/PA capsules and (b) TEM image of DS/PA capsules.

To quantify the loading of β-gal
enzyme within DS/PA capsules,
we have used ONPG as the assay buffer. Scheme 2 illustrates the reaction of β-galactosidase
enzyme over ONPG, an artificial substrate. A yellow color compound, o-nitrophenol (ONP), is formed after hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG)
in presence of β-gal enzyme. Confirmation of β-gal loading
was done by mixing an equal volume of polymeric capsules (β-gal-DS/PA)
and double strength ONPG assay buffer provided in β-galactosidase
detection kit (GAL-A) for an hour. Confocal images of treated capsules
(β-gal DS/PA, Figure S5A and β-gal
PSS/PAH, Figure S5B) demonstrate the formation
of a yellow color compound, o-nitrophenol, after
hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside
(ONPG) and hence confirm the β-gal enzyme loading in β-gal-DS/PA
and β-gal-PSS/PAH capsules. The loading of β-gal enzyme
within DS/PA capsules is found to be 3 mU/100 capsules.

3.2 Cell Culture Studies
To access the
delivery competence, polymeric capsules have been analyzed for cytotoxicity,
internalization by the cells, and release of enzyme and therapeutic
activity at an in vitro level. SV (β-galactosidase gene-deficient
mouse fibroblast) and R201C (deficient human β-gal gene-introduced
mouse fibroblast, KO mouse-derived SV cells) were selected as disease
model cell lines for cell culture studies. Further, same studies were
also done on wild-type mouse fibroblast and HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma
cells, as a negative control).

3.2.1 Cytotoxicity and Capsule
Uptake Studies
The cytotoxicity of DS/PA capsules was studied
in all four cell
lines: SV, R201C, wild-type mouse fibroblast, and HeLa cells, by using
MTT assay to observe the effect of internalized capsules on cell viability.
Cells were incubated with DS/PA capsules up to 100 capsules per cell
for a period of 18 h, and cell viability was measured. Figure 2 demonstrates that the capsules
possess no cytotoxicity with R201C (a), SV (b), HeLa (c), and wild-type
mouse fibroblast (d) cells. To substantiate the capsule internalization
inside the cells, RITC-labeled DS/PA capsules were incubated with
cells for 12 h. In Figure 3, red fluorescence exhibited by the RITC-labeled DS/PA capsules,
after cellular internalization in SV (a), R201C (b), wild-type mouse
fibroblast (c), and HeLa (d), demonstrates that most of the cells
have internalized capsules inside. Z-stack images (Figure 3, top inset) state that the
red fluorescence due to internalized
RITC-labeled capsule also confirms the efficient uptake of capsules
inside the cells. Nuclei were stained by DAPI. From the cytotoxicity
and capsule uptake studies, it can be concluded that DS/PA capsules
can be employed as intracellular delivery cargos in biological systems.

3.2.2 In Vitro Enzyme Release Studies
Figure 4a demonstrates
the confocal microscopy images of β-gal enzyme release from
DS/PA capsules inside HeLa cells at 6, 12, and 24 h time point (Figure S6). The yellow fluorescence observed
in the confocal microscopy images is due to the formation of o-nitrophenol (ONP), suggesting the release of β-gal
from the capsules. The quantification of the enzyme release is given
in Figure 4b, and it
clearly suggests that the release of enzyme is at the maximum at 12
h time point compared to that at 24 h time point. The reduction in
the enzyme release at 24 h time point can be attributed to the consumption
of enzyme by the GM1 ganglioside substrates (see Figures 5–7). The release of the enzyme is further confirmed by the quantification
of enzyme in cell lysate at 4, 6, 12, and 24 h time point (Figure 4c). We observed the
maximum release (77%) at 12 h time point, which further confirms the
above observation. To emphasize the releasing capability of DS/PA
capsules, we have done the similar release studies (12 h time point)
with nondegradable PSS/PAH capsules as the control experiment (Figure 4d), in which PSS/PAH
capsules show very minimal release (18%). The control capsules have
been prepared using silica as the template, which has also been characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (Figure S1B,C) and DLS measurement (Figures S7 and S8).

capsules/cells (bottom panel, a) and 100 β-gal-DS/PA capsules/cells

toxin B was used as a detection probe for GM1 ganglioside accumulation
in culture fibroblasts. (b) and (d) represent the corresponding fluorescence
intensity. Note: Control is untreated cells, and negative control
is cells treated with bare DS/PA capsules (50 and 100 capsules/cell).

3.3 Enzyme
Activity Studies
Enzyme is
a biocatalyst that binds with specific substrate molecules and undergoes
a chemical reaction to convert it into a new product. Scheme 3 illustrates the reaction of
β-galactosidase enzyme over GM1 ganglioside. β-Gal, being
a glycoside hydrolase enzyme, catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-galactoside
into monosaccharide by breaking of the glycosidic bond. Figures 5–7 demonstrate the enzyme activity studies of β-gal-DS/PA capsules
on R201C, SV, and wild-type mouse fibroblast, respectively. We note
that FITC-cholera toxin B specifically binds to GM1 ganglioside and
this has been used as track tracer41−46 to mark the level of GM1 ganglioside inside the cell. The binding
event is monitored by the observation of green fluorescence from the
cells using a confocal microscope. Two hundred cells were quantified
for green fluorescence produced by FITC-labeled cholera toxin B using
Image J software. Figure 5a,c shows the confocal images and Figure 5b,d shows the fluorescence intensity per
cell of R201C cells when treated with β-gal-DS/PA capsules at
two different concentrations, 50 capsules (Figure 5a) and 100 capsules (Figure 5c) at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h time intervals.
R201C cells were also treated with the equivalent free β-gal
enzyme as a control experiment and bare DS/PA capsules in equivalent
capsule concentration as a negative control experiment.

Scheme 3 Schematic
Illustration of β-Galactosidase Enzyme Activity on
GM1 Ganglioside Substrate
Confocal images of R201C cells treated with β-gal-DS/PA
capsules
(50 capsules/cell (Figure 5a) and 100 capsules/cell (Figure 5c)) demonstrate the significant reduction
in green fluorescence at 6, 12, and 24 h interval. The decrease in
green fluorescence suggests the reduction in GM1 ganglioside level
inside cells, which is attributed to the activity of β-gal enzyme
over the GM1 ganglioside substrate. It was also found that the reduction
in the GM1 ganglioside level increases with time. To roughly estimate
the reduction in the GM1 ganglioside level, we have quantified the
green fluorescence intensity per cell using Image J software (Figure 5b,d). Figure 5b (50 capsules/cell) and Figure 5d (100 capsules/cell)
clearly suggest that the reduction in GM1 ganglioside is 1.8- and
2.2-fold, respectively, after 24 h β-gal-DS/PA capsules delivery.
This result also supports the activity of β-gal enzyme over
the substrate. In contrast, Figure 5a (top panel) and Figure 5c (top panel) demonstrate no change in green
fluorescence when samples are treated with free β-gal enzyme
equivalent to 50 and 100 capsules concentrations, respectively, at
time intervals which support the need of capsules as the delivery
vehicle. This is further supported by the graph (black bar) in Figure 5b,d.

From these
results, it can be articulated that reduction in both
green fluorescence and intensity per cell shows decline in GM1 ganglioside
substrate level in R201C cells when treated with β-gal-DS/PA
capsules at different time intervals. R201C cell line, being deficient human β-galactosidase gene-introduced β-galactosidase
KO mouse fibroblast, is not able to express β-gal enzyme on
its own because the gene responsible for expressing β-gal enzyme
is lacking. Here, it could be speculated that this enzyme activity
is due to the β-gal enzyme that is being released by β-gal-DS/PA
capsules inside the cells. β-Gal enzyme in its free form has
not been taken up by the cells. This might be due to poor membrane
permeability and deprived uptake of β-gal by cells; hence, no
cutback is seen in GM1 ganglioside substrate level.

Similar
results were observed when SV β-gal gene-deficient
mouse fibroblast (Figure 6a–d) and wild-type mouse fibroblast (Figure 7a–d) were treated in the same manner. No reduction
in the GM1 ganglioside substrate level was seen when the enzyme was delivered in free form. In contrast, β-gal delivered by
DS/PA capsules show 3.4- and 1.9-fold reduction in GM1 Ganglioside
at 50 and 100 capsules per cell in SV cells. Similarly, 2.8- and 3.1-fold
reduction in β-gal substrate was observed at 50 and 100 capsules
per cell in wild-type mouse fibroblast cells. Herein, it can be concluded
that β-gal enzyme delivered by DS/PA capsules in all three cell
lines (R201C, SV, and wild-type mouse fibroblast) shows a significant
reduction in the substrate level after a time interval. This shows
that enzyme cargos in the form of polymeric capsule are first efficiently
taken up by the cells and enzyme is being released from DS/PA capsules
by inherent biodegradation and also same results were observed at
two different concentrations (50 and 100 capsules concentration). Figure 8 reveals the level
of GM1 ganglioside in treated as well as untreated cells of R201C
(black bars), SV (red bars), and wild-type mouse fibroblast (blue
bars). The fluorescence intensity per cell of untreated cells is higher
in the case of positive control (SV and R201C) than in negative control
(wild-type mouse fibroblast), which states the higher level of GM1
ganglioside in SV and R201C as compared to that in wild-type mouse
fibroblast. We observed 1.8-, 3.4-, and 2.8-fold reduction in GM1
ganglioside in treated R201C, SV, and wild-type mouse fibroblast cells,
respectively, at 50 capsules per cell concentration. This confirms
the release and therapeutic activity of β-gal enzyme inside
the cells through DS/PA capsules. Moreover, the level of GM1 ganglioside
substrate in gene-deficient cell lines is reduced to a normal endogenous
level that is present in untreated wild-type mouse fibroblast cells.

4 Conclusions
We report
an efficient intracellular delivery of β-gal enzyme
by arginase-responsive dextran sulfate/poly-l-arginine layer-by-layer
polymeric capsules (DS/PA capsules) for the therapy of GM1 gangliosidosis.
The in vitro therapeutic activity of β-gal has been evaluated
in SV (β-galactosidase gene-deficient mouse fibroblast), R201C
(deficient human β-galactosidase gene-introduced mouse fibroblast),
and wild-type mouse fibroblast. Significant reduction in the GM1 ganglioside
substrate level present in all of the three cell lines (R201C, SV,
and wild-type mouse fibroblast) is observed in the case of β-gal
enzyme delivered through DS/PA capsules, whereas the free form showed
no reduction. Furthermore, the level of the GM1 ganglioside substrate
in gene-deficient cell lines is reduced to a normal endogenous level
that is present in untreated wild-type mouse fibroblast cells.
