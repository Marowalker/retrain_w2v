A new melatonin sulfonate
derivative sodium
4-(3-(2-acetamidoethyl)-5-methoxy-1H-indol-1-yl)
butane-1-sulfonate (MLTBS) with higher water solubility (695 times)
and lower cytotoxicity than natural melatonin (MLT) was synthesized,
yet with the same sleep aid function. The poor solubility of MLT in
water has been improved with a simple chemical reaction, which solves
the poor solubility of melatonin in water, overcoming the safety problem
caused by adding organic reagents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and ethanol to increase the solubility. Moreover, the modified MLT
still has the same sleep aid effect as the natural MLT and higher
biological safety. As a novel potential drug for sleep aid, the new
MLT derivative could also flourish the application and research of
this molecule in medicine and biology.

==== Body
Introduction
Melatonin
(MLT), also known as
the pineal hormone, is one of the hormones secreted by the brain pineal
gland.1 It belongs to indole heterocyclic
compounds with the chemical name N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine.
MLT was discovered and synthesized by Dr. Aaronb Lerner, a dermatologist
at Yale University, in 1953. This compound exists not only in primitive
organisms as simple as prokaryotes but also in complex organisms as
humans.2 MLT is an ancient molecule that
exists in animals and plants. It has been extensively studied for
its diverse biological effects.3 MLT is
a kind of type II drug with low water solubility and high permeability.
It has a very short half-life and limited bioavailability.4 Researchers found that the main function of
MLT in the human body is to regulate the circadian rhythmicity5,6 and the secretion of the endocrine system.7 MLT can regulate human body clocks8 and
induce physiological sleep.9 In recent
years, scientists have focused on the antioxidant ability of MLT.10 Since MLT has a high antioxidant value and
can be used as a skincare product to remove free radicals in the body,
researchers have mixed MLT with Pickering cream to improve the stability
of MLT and used it to protect the skin from the sun.11 On the other hand, there are more and more reports on
the modification of natural MLT by chemical methods. Through the substitution
modification of the MLT acetamide moiety, the molecule Neu-p11 (Figure S1) can be used to repair memory damage
and is expected to be a potential drug for the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease.12 Meanwhile, Neu-11 has a neuroprotective
mechanism in cerebral ischemia13 as well.
The modified 5-hydroxy-2′-isobutyl-streptochlorin (HIS) (Figure S1) molecule on the indole ring of MLT
has an anti-inflammatory function, which can inhibit the production
of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The molecule is expected
to be a leading drug in the treatment of various diseases mediated
by inflammation.14 Substitution of the
second position of the MLT indole ring by trifluoromethyl (MLTD, Figure S1) can significantly affect the sleep
awakening cycle, which is expected to be used as a hypnotic drug in
the treatment of sleep disorders.15 MLT
can be used in many different fields. In addition to the field of
sleep aid and antiaging agents, MLT has also been extensively studied
in the field of anticancer.16,17 It can inhibit the
growth of different types of cancer cells including human prostate
cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, skin carcinoma,
and breast cancer through a variety of mechanisms.18 For example, the substitution of the methoxyl group of
MLT to afford UCM1037 (Figure S1) can effectively
inhibit the production of LNCaP in prostate cancer cell lines.19 Brominated MLT (1-benzyl-2,4,6-tribromomelatonin, Figure S1) is also used in the treatment of bone
marrow diseases.20

Results and Discussion
In our study, we found that
the water solubility of MLT was very poor. MLT dissolved very little
in water, and the solution was turbid. Such low solubility greatly
limited the research and functional application of MLT. In the literature,
organic solvents such as ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were
usually added to increase its water solubility.19,21,22 However, these additives on the human body
had certain stimulation and cytotoxicity on the human body. Yet, there
are few reports on improving its water solubility in the literature.
To deal with this problem, herein, we report a method to improve the
water solubility of MLT by adding water-soluble groups, namely sulfonate.
Sulfonate groups are often used to improve the solubility of hydrophobic
drug molecules due to their good water solubility, low toxicity, and
good stability.23−25
In this paper, the physiological functions of the modified MLT derivatives
will be discussed.

We designed and synthesized a new derivative
of MLT by introducing a sulfonate group, namely sodium 4-(3-(2-acetamidoethyl)-5-methoxy-1H-indol-1-yl) butane-1-sulfonate (MLTBS) (Figure 1). This new derivative has
better water solubility than MLT. MLTBS was synthesized from MLT by
direct treatment with NaH and 1,4-butane sulfone in tetrahydrofuran
(THF). We also confirmed that the newly synthesized MLT derivative
has the original function of MLT in the sleep experiment of mice.

Figure 1 Synthesis of MLTBS from MLT.

To evaluate the solubility of the new MLT derivative, we tested the
solubility of MLT and MLTBS. The solubility of MLTBS in 100 mL of
water was about 160 g, while that of MLT in 100 mL of water was 0.2
g, as inquired by SCCS (Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, Opinion
on MLT, 23 March 2010). Therefore, the solubility of MLTBS was 695
times that of MLT (Figure 2A). To make a more intuitive comparison of their difference
of solubility, we added a certain amount of solid powder into the
same volume of water and observed their dissolution in the water.
As shown in Figure 2B, natural MLT was added into the water to form a turbid solution,
while MLTBS could form a clear and transparent solution in the water.
These results indicated that MLTBS has better water solubility.

Loss of righting reflex (LORR) and recovery is a widely accepted
method to evaluate rodent behavior. Researchers often use this harmless
behavior pattern to assess whether the animals have retained their
awareness of the surrounding environment or being influenced by the
hypnotic effects of drugs.26,27 With the intent to
verify that MLTBS has the same physiological activity as MLT, we established
a mouse-sleeping model to test the sleep-promoting function of MLTBS.
C57/B6 mice were purchased from the Animal Laboratory Center of Xiamen
University and randomly divided into three groups. The sleep model
of mice was simulated by an intraperitoneal injection of 1% pentobarbital
sodium. Then, normal saline, ML, and MLTBS were injected, respectively.
Since MLT dissolves poorly in water, 5% DMSO was added to the solution
to help dissolving it (MLT and MLTBS were dissolved in saline containing
5% DMSO at a concentration of 86 μM). The sleep time was recorded
starting from 1 min after the loss of righting reflex to the recovery
of righting reflex. The results showed that MLTBS had the same effect
as MLT. It could significantly prolong the sleep time of mice from
1 to 3 h (Figure 3A).
However, the physiological content of MLT in the body is very low.
MLT is mainly secreted at night. The amount of MLT secreted every
night is between 10 and 80 μg.28
Studies have shown that to achieve an artificial MLT environment that
produces physiological levels in the human body, the amount of exogenous
MLT injected intravenously should be less than 100 μg.29 According to the dosage of MLTD in the previous
literature,15 we reduced the concentration
of MLT and MLTBS to 860 nM and then injected intraperitoneally. The
experimental results are shown in Figure 3B. In the case of low MLTBS concentration,
the same hypnotic effect as MLT could still be observed. Therefore,
MLTBS has an important potential application in sleep aid.

Figure 3 MLTBS can promote sleep in mice and prolong
the sleep time. The mice
were intraperitoneally injected with 1% sodium pentobarbital solution
and then MLT and MLTBS solutions were intraperitoneally injected;
physiological saline was used in the control group. MLT and MLTBS
injection doses were 100 μL ((A) 86 μM; (B) 860 nM). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.

MLT
is one of the least recognized toxic substances. In human studies,
high doses of MLT are well tolerated.30
No serious (grade 3) or life-threatening (grade 4) toxicity was shown.
In animal experiments, the LD50 of MLT in mice was more than 800 mg/kg.31 We focused on verifying the toxicity of the
synthesized MLTBS to cells and animals. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8)
reagent was used to detect the effect of MLTBS on cell proliferation.32 CCK-8 mainly contains WST-8, which can be reduced
by dehydrogenase in mitochondria to yellow formazan with high water
solubility. The amount of formazan produced is proportional to the
number of living cells. The number of living cells can be reflected
by measuring the light absorption value at 450 nm wavelength by ELISA.
B16F10 cell lines were inoculated into 96-well plates. After cell
adherence, MLT and MLTBS solutions at different concentrations were
added to each well in turn. The final concentrations were 10 μM,
100 μM, 1 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM, respectively. After incubation
for 24 h, the CCK-8 reagent was added into each well. The absorbance
of the solutions was measured at 450 nm. The results showed that MLT
and MLTBS had no effects on cell proliferation at low concentrations
(Figure 4). At high
concentrations of 5 and 10 mM, MLT affected the cell proliferation
rate, while the effect of MLTBS was little, which is significantly
different from that of MLT. Even at a higher concentration, the cytotoxicity
of MLTBS on the cells was much smaller than that of MLT.

Figure 4 Effects of MLTBS and
MLT upon cell proliferation. Here, 100 μL of cell suspension
(about 10 000 B16F10 cells) was added to each well of a 96-well
plate. MLT and MLTBS were added with a final concentration of 10 mM,
5 mM, 1 mM, 100 μM, and 1 μM, respectively. The CCK-8
reagent was added. The OD450 values after 4 h were measured.
The experiments were performed in triplicate three times. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.

To
test the safety of MLT in vivo, we injected MLT, MLTBS, and saline
intraperitoneally into mice. We monitored the body weight and diet
of the mice. The statuses of mice were observed. As shown in Figure 5, the injection of
MLTBS had no significant effect on the body weight and diet of the
mice compared with the control group and the MLT group. The results
showed that MLTBS had good safety in vivo. In short, our results indicated
that MLTBS has lower toxicity and good safety in vitro and in vivo.

growth and diet of mice. The control group was intraperitoneally injected
with 200 μL of saline(black line). The MLT group was intraperitoneally
injected with 200 μL of MLT solution (red line). The MLTBS group
was intraperitoneally injected with 200 μL of MLTBS at a concentration
of 10 mM on 2, 6, and 10 days, respectively. (A) Statistical curve

Conclusions
In summary, we have
designed and synthesized a water-soluble MLT derivative, MLTBS. This
new derivative retained the active structure of the MLT molecule and
the original physiological function of MLT. Compared with MLT, MLTBS
has an advantage of good water solubility, lower toxicity, and good
safety, in vitro and in vivo. As a novel potential drug for sleep
aid, MLTBS could also shed new light on the application and research
of MLT in medicine and biology.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Pentobarbital
and CCK-8 were purchased from a local vendor, and C57/B6 mice were
purchased from the Animal Laboratory Center of Xiamen University.
B16F10 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
The cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. All chemical reagents were purchased
online from http://www.tansoole.com.

Synthesis of
the Melatonin Derivative MLTBS
Melatonin (100 mg) was dissolved
in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL), and
then NaH (69 mg) was added to the above mixture in an ice bath. The
reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min in the ice bath, and then,
1,4-butane sulfone (88 mg) was added dropwise into the above mixture.
After that, the ice bath was removed, and the reaction was stirred
overnight at room temperature. To quench the reaction, ice water (30
mL) was added. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate,
and the water phase was obtained. Then, the water was removed by rotating
evaporation under vacuum, and the residues were purified by column
chromatography on silica gel to give a crude product, which is then
purified with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to afford

Determination
of Melatonin Solubility
The solubility of MLTBS was measured
by the saturated solution method. First, 0.1 mL of distilled water
was taken and placed in a 25 °C environment. Then, MLTBS was
added slowly into the water and oscillated at the same time until
MLTBS had precipitated. After standing for a period of time, the precipitate
was filtered out. Then, we calculated the mass of MLTBS dissolved
in water to be 160 mg. Therefore, at 25 °C, the solubility of
MLTBS in water is 160 g/100 mL.

Effects
of Melatonin on Sleep in Mice
We injected 300 μL of
1% sodium pentobarbital solution into mice to establish sleep models.
Then, the mice were divided into three groups, with five in each group.
The first group was injected with 100 μL of normal saline to
act as the control group, the second group was injected with natural
unmodified melatonin (MLT) solution (86 μM or 860 nM, 100 μL),
and the third group was injected with modified melatonin (MLTBS) solution
of the same concentration and volume. The sleep time was recorded
1 min after the loss of righting reflex, and the timer ended when
the righting reflex returned.

Cell
Proliferation Assays
B16F10 cell lines were inoculated into
96-well plates. After cell adherence, 10 μL of MLT and MLTBS
solutions at different concentrations was added to each well in turn.
The final concentrations were 10 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM, 5 mM,
and 10 mM. After incubation for 24 h, the medium was replaced with
fresh cell culture medium, and 10 μL of CCK-8 reagent was added
into each hole and cultured in the incubator for 4 h, and the absorbance
was measured at 450 nm.

Effects of
MLTBS on the Growth and Diet of Mice
C57/B6 mice (about 18
g) were used and randomly divided into three groups: control group,
MLT group, and MLTBS group. Then, 200 μL of normal saline, MLT,
and MLTBS (MLT and MLTBS were dissolved in saline containing 5% DMSO,
10 mmol) were intraperitoneally injected, respectively, three times
on 2, 6, and 10 days, and the changes in mice body weight and diet
were recorded.
