We used a standardized
in vitro simulation of the intestinal environment
of three human donors to investigate the effect of six oat ingredients,
which were produced by the application of different processing techniques,
on the gut microbial community. Fructooligosaccharide was used as
the positive control. Consistent changes in pH and gas production,
on average −0.4 pH units and +32 kPa, indicated the high fermentability
of the oat ingredients, and the resulting increased production of
metabolites that are considered as beneficial for human health. These
metabolites included acetate and lactate, but mostly propionate (+13.6
mM on average). All oat ingredients resulted in increased bifidobacteria
levels with an average increase of 0.73 log. Moreover, a decreased
production of proteolytic markers was observed, including branched
short-chain fatty acids and ammonium. The results were donor-specific
and product-specific. The results suggested an association between
the total amounts of dietary fiber and the prebiotic potentials of
different ingredients. Furthermore, as mechanical processing of oat
products has previously been linked to increased extractability of
dietary fibers, the obtained results suggest that different processing
techniques might have impacted the potential functional properties
of the final ingredients.

==== Body
Introduction
In the past decade,
study findings have revealed associations between
the intestinal microbial community and human health and disease. The
gut microbiota affects the immune system of the host,1 participates in fat storage and synthesis in the body,2,3 transforms phytoestrogens into potent estrogenic metabolites,4 and reduces the risk of colon cancer.5,6 Modulation of the human gut microbiota has potential as a strategy
for improving human health. Changes can be accomplished using supplementation
of prebiotics. These nondigestible substrates are selectively used
by the host micro-organisms conferring a health benefit.7 Prebiotic use can have various beneficial effects
on the human body (e.g., improved intestinal barrier function, reduction
of intestinal inflammation, modulation of immune status, and reduced
risk of obesity, colon cancer, and type II diabetes).8

While inulin-type fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) are
one of the
most studied prebiotic compounds,9,10 several novel
classes of prebiotics are emerging. For example, studies have revealed
some health-promoting effects of the oat fiber consumed during oat
product intake. The associated effects include cholesterol reduction,11−13 modulation of blood glucose levels,13−15 improved weight management,16 and immune regulation.17,18

Many of these effects have been attributed to the β-glucans,
which is a group of soluble fibers present in oats. These non-starch
polysaccharides consist of β-linked chains of d-glucose
monomers. Depending on the source, each β-glucan can have a
different branching structure, viscosity, solubility, and molecular
weight; these characteristics affect the functional properties of
β-glucans.16 Oat typically contains
a mixture of unbranched β-glucans with β-1,3- and β-1,4-glycosidic
linkages.16 Variations in the processing
conditions of oats have direct effects on β-glucan release from
the cell wall of the oat groats. The resulting structural differences
account for the differences in physiological properties and related
health effects of oat β-glucans. Mechanical processing increases
the release of β-glucans from the oat groats by reducing the
particle size,19 and hydrothermal processing
reduces the extractability of oat β-glucans.19,20 Hydrothermal processing increases oat product viscosity,20 which can reduce glucose and cholesterol absorption
in the gastrointestinal tract.21,22

Although study
findings have revealed oat β-glucan structural
differences and some associations with health and disease, the links
between oats processed using different methods and the resulting potential
prebiotic properties of oat β-glucans on the gut microbiome
remain poorly understood.

In vitro approaches are widely used
to study the possible prebiotic
properties of selected food ingredients. A wide range of in vitro
systems are available. These range from short-term colonic batch incubation23−25 to long-term continuous models that allow in-depth study of intestinal
microbial processes when test compounds are added under representative
environmental conditions.26−28 Because environmental factors
can be strictly controlled, in vitro studies are an appropriate alternative
to in vivo studies for providing mechanistic insights into the interactions
between food ingredients and effects on the human gut microbiome.
To obtain representative microbial communities, in vitro gut models
rely on fecal samples from human subjects.23,29 There are large differences in gut microbial composition between
human individuals.30 These differences
can affect the utilization of dietary ingredients via different metabolic
pathways.31,32 Therefore, it is important to account for
interindividual variability in gut microbial composition during in
vivo and in vitro studies.

Our main study objective was to investigate
the potential prebiotic
effects of supplementation of six types of oat ingredients on the
colonic microbiota of three individuals upon digestion. The oat ingredients
were produced using different processing techniques. We used FOS as
the positive control supplement. We used a standardized in vitro simulation
of the intestinal environment to obtain mechanistic insights into
the microbial activity and composition changes that occurred in response
to the fermentation of different oat ingredients.

Results
Digestibility
of Starch from Oat Ingredients
The fractions
of digestible and nondigestible starch were quantified by determining
the starch levels in the initial oat ingredients and at the end of
the small intestinal incubation (Figure 1). A significant part of the starch was removed
for each of the products during upper gastrointestinal digestion and
absorption. For old-fashioned oats (1), instant oat flakes (2), and
steel-cut oats (4), >30% of the product was removed via starch
digestion
and subsequent absorption. These changes corresponded to the digestion
and absorption of starch of >55%
(Table 1).

Overall Microbial Metabolic Activity in Terms of Acidification
and Gas Production
The overall degrees of acidification and
gas production were markers for the intensity of bacterial metabolism
of the test compounds (Table 2; Supporting Information Table 2). The positive control (FOS) resulted in the greatest pH decrease
(−1.05) and gas production (+50.8 kPa) during the 0–48
h of incubation period. Microbial fermentation was less pronounced
during the incubation of the blank negative control (BNC (−0.05
and +20.9 kPa)). A pH increase (+0.14) rather than a decrease occurred
in the FOS samples during the 24–48 h time interval, probably
by depletion of the test ingredient.

values for pH changes and increases in gas pressure (kPa) between
0–24, 24–48, and 0–48 h, upon fermentation of
the different test compounds (1 = old-fashioned oats; 2 = instant
oat flakes; 3 = oat bran; 4 = steel-cut oats; 5 = pre-cooked oat flour;
6 = pre-cooked Morrison oat flour; 7 = fructooligosaccharide) by human
fecal microbiota of three different donors (A, B, and C), versus their
respective blank negative controls (BNCs). For optimal observation
of consistent effects over the microbiota of the three donors, the
mean values (“donor A/B/C”) are presented (n = 9; n = 3 derived from three observations per
donor). Significant differences between the test compounds are indicated
with different letters (p < 0.05).

Compared with BNC, there was a statistically
significant increase
in colonic gas production and decrease in colonic pH for all oat ingredients.
However, these changes were less than the changes in the FOS samples.
Most of the effects of the oat ingredients on these parameters occurred
during the first 24 h of incubation with (i) a decrease in the mean
pH of approximately −0.40 (versus −0.04 for BNC), and
(ii) an increase in gas pressure varying between +29 and +35 kPa,
depending on the test ingredient (versus ±18 kPa for BNC). There
were no statistically significant differences between the oat ingredients.

There were specific inter-donor differences in gas production (Supporting
Information Table 3). Overall, gas production
during the first 6 h of incubation was greater for donor A, compared
with donor C and especially donor B.

Microbial Metabolic Activity
in Terms of Short-Chain Fatty Acids
(SCFAs), Lactate (LA), and NH4+ Production
Acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate are metabolites that
result from microbial carbohydrate metabolism (Figure 2; Supporting Information Table 4). Final acetate levels were the lowest in the control
samples (BNC; 14.8 mM); the FOS samples had the highest acetate levels
(35.1 mM) (Figure 2A). All oat ingredient samples led to a statistically significant
increase in acetate levels relative to the BNC samples. However, the
increase was less than that for the FOS samples. Most of the acetate
production occurred during the 0–24 h interval. However, statistically
significant amounts of acetate were produced between 24 and 48 h for
several oat ingredients, compared with the FOS and BNC samples (i.e.,
oat bran (3), steel-cut oats (4), pre-cooked oat flour (5), and pre-cooked
Morrison oat flour (6)).

production). Mean
values for (A) acetate, (B) propionate, (C) butyrate, and (D) lactate
production (mM) during the initial 0–24 h and the 24–48
h time intervals, during fermentation of test compounds (1 = old-fashioned
oats; 2 = instant oat flakes; 3 = oat bran; 4 = steel-cut oats; 5
= pre-cooked oat flour; 6 = pre-cooked Morrison oat flour; 7 = fructooligosaccharide)
by human fecal microbiota of three different donors (A, B, and C)
versus their respective blank negative controls (BNC). For optimal
observation of consistent overall microbiota-related effects, the
mean values (donor A/B/C) are presented (n = 9; derived
from three observations per donor). Significant differences between
the test compounds are indicated with different letters (p < 0.05). For acetate (A), propionate (B) and butyrate (C), significant
differences are indicated for the 0–48 h time interval, while
for lactate (D) differences are indicated for both the 0–24
h and the 24–48 h time intervals.

Control sample incubation resulted in the lowest propionate
levels
for the three donors tested (Figure 2B). For all donors, the increase in propionate production
was greater for the six oat ingredients versus the positive control
FOS; the oat bran (3) samples had the highest propionate production
(14.3 mM). There were specific inter-donor differences in initial
propionate production. During the first 6 h of incubation, donor A
had higher propionate levels, compared with donor C and especially
donor B (Supporting Information Table 3).

The highest butyrate production occurred in the FOS samples.
This
difference was especially attributed to a high production during the
final 24 h of incubation (3.7 mM). Compared with the BNC samples,
none of the oat ingredient samples had significantly higher butyrate
production (Figure 2C). Amongst the oat ingredients, steel-cut oats (4) resulted in the
highest butyrate production levels (3.1 mM).

Lactate levels
(Figure 2D) were low
in the control incubation (1.3 mM). The FOS samples
had the highest mean lactate production levels during the 0–24
h time interval (5.9 mM), and high consumption during the final 24
h of incubation (−3.8 mM). The consumption of lactate was lower
(i.e., between −0.6 and −1.1 mM) for the oat ingredient
samples. There were significant correlations (R2 = 0.83; p < 0.0001) between lactate consumption
during the last 24 h of incubation and butyrate production during
the same time interval for FOS and the six oat ingredients (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Correlation between lactate
consumption and butyrate production.
Lactate consumption and butyrate production (mM) during the 24–48
h time interval, upon fermentation of test compounds (1 = old-fashioned
oats; 2 = instant oat flakes; 3 = oat bran; 4 = steel-cut oats; 5
= pre-cooked oat flour; 6 = pre-cooked Morrison oat flour; 7 = fructooligosaccharide)
by human fecal microbiota of three different donors (A, B, and C)
versus their respective blank negative controls (BNCs).

Branched SCFAs and ammonium are markers of microbial
protein metabolism.
Branched SCFA production was strongly decreased for the FOS and the
six oat ingredient samples compared to the BNC (Table 3; Supporting Information Table 5). The FOS samples had the greatest decline in branched
SCFA production (i.e., 0.2 mM for FOS versus 2.1 mM for BNC). The
ammonium concentration was strongly decreased by all oat ingredients,
compared with BNC (Table 3). For the branched SCFAs, an even lower production of ammonium
was associated with the fermentation of FOS. Among the oat ingredients,
the lowest production of branched SCFAs and ammonium occurred for
oat bran (3). The pre-cooked oat flour (5) samples had the highest
branched SCFA production and steel-cut oats (4) samples had even higher
ammonium production.

Changes in Microbial Community Composition
Quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was performed to assess
the effects of the test substances on specific taxonomic groups of
bacteria (Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, and Firmicutes) (Table 4). Firmicutes levels
remained stable throughout colonic incubation. The different test
substances had no effects on the concentration of bacteria belonging
to this phylum.

(1 = old-fashioned oats; 2 = instant oat flakes; 3 = oat bran; 4 =
steel-cut oats; 5 = pre-cooked oat flour; 6 = pre-cooked Morrison

different human donors (A, B, and C), versus their respective blank
negative controls (BNCs). For optimal observation of consistent effects
over the microbiota of the three donors, the mean values (donor A/B/C)
are presented (n = 9; n = 3 per
donor). For Lactobacillus, also the mean individual
levels are shown as they were characterized by distinct inter-donor
differences. Significant differences between the test substances are
indicated with different letters (p < 0.05).

The use of FOS resulted in
the greatest increase in Bifidobacterium spp. levels
(+1.03 log). Compared with the BNC, the use of every
oat ingredient resulted in significantly increased Bifidobacterium spp. levels, but the changes were less than when FOS was used. There
were no statistically significant differences between the different
oat ingredients.

Lactobacillus spp. levels
were characterized by
distinct inter-donor differences. For donor A, none of the test substances
had a significant effect on Lactobacillus spp. levels.
Strong increases were obtained for donor B, because Lactobacillus spp. was under-represented in the fecal inoculum of this donor.
The increase was greatest after FOS supplementation (+3.5 log), but
the use of oat ingredients also resulted in increased Lactobacillus spp. levels that were mostly similar to the BNC. Compared with the
BNC, the use of pre-cooked oat flour resulted in a small additional
increase in Lactobacillus levels (+0.3 log). For
donor C, there was a strong effect on Lactobacillus spp. levels for the positive control FOS samples. The use of the
oat ingredients did not result in any statistically significant effects
on Lactobacilli.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
To compare the final
effects among the test products, the increase and decrease from 0
to 48 h of incubation for all parameters were used to create a PCA
biplot (Figure 4).
The only exception was lactate; this intermediate metabolite is produced
and subsequently consumed and peak levels occur at 24 h. Therefore,
the use of levels at 48 h is not valid for the interpretation of overall
effects. The results of the analysis indicated that the positive (FOS)
and negative (BNC) control samples grouped into separate clusters.
For the oat ingredients, the clusters were mainly associated with
inter-donor differences. Within these donor-associated clusters, old-fashioned
oats (1), instant oat flakes (2), pre-cooked oat flour (5) and pre-cooked
Morrison oat flour (6) clustered closely together, while oat bran
(3) and steel-cut oat (4) samples tended to be more different from
the other oat ingredients (except for steel-cut oats (4) in donor
A). Oat bran (3) samples tended to be more similar to the FOS samples,
while steel-cut oat (4) samples trended towards the negative control
samples.

Figure 4 Principal component analysis. PCA biplot obtained for the effects
of the six oat ingredients on gut microbiota activity and composition,
compared with a positive and a negative control. The biplot plots
the variables (analytes) as vectors and the observations (test) as
dots. Each observation consists of a white (donor A), gray (donor
B), or black (donor C) dot and a number from 1 to 7 (or BNC), which
indicate the specific test conditions (1 = old-fashioned oats; 2 =
instant oat flakes; 3 = oat bran; 4 = steel-cut oats; 5 = pre-cooked
oat flour; 6 = pre-cooked Morrison oat flour; 7 = fructooligosaccharide).
The first two principal components explained 78% of variation.

Discussion
We
used standardized in vitro simulation of the intestinal environment
and FOS as a positive control to investigate the fermentability of
six oat ingredients. Oat products contain a large fraction of digestible
starch. Because this starch is absorbed at the level of the small
intestine after conversion into maltose and glucose, an in vitro simulation
of small intestinal absorption preceded the colonic incubations. To
validate this dialysis procedure, the digestion and subsequent absorption
characteristics of the oat ingredients were determined. Consistent
with Kim et al.’s finding, approximately 50% of the starch
in different cooked oat ingredients was digested and absorbed.37 The subsequent colonic fermentation elicited
consistent changes at the metabolic activity level (i.e., in SCFA,
lactic acid, and NH4+ production), with donor-specific
differences, probably partly influenced by the remaining indigestible
starch content of the oat ingredients.

The consistent changes
in pH and gas production indicated the high
fermentability of the oat ingredients. This fermentation resulted
in increased numbers of Bifidobacteria. Prebiotic properties are often
evaluated using changes in Bifidobacteria populations because many
microbial species linked with health-promoting properties are members
of this group. Bifidobacteria include many species that can degrade
complex carbohydrates.38 Increase in the Bifidobacterium spp. levels occur after oat consumption,
and by extension, β-glucan-rich cereal.39−44 Mårtensson et al.43 found that supplementation
with oat-based products stimulated Bifidobacteria growth in the gastrointestinal
tracts of hypercholesterolemic human subjects. This change was accompanied
by a reduction in plasma cholesterol levels. Queenan et al.45 found that total cholesterol and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower in
hypercholesterolemic adults after daily supplementation of oat β-glucans
for 6 weeks. The increase in Bifidobacteria for the oat products we
investigated thus confirms that these products have potential to result
in specific health benefits.

The use of oat ingredients increased
the production of the metabolites,
acetate and lactate, but especially propionate. In vitro24,42,46 and in vivo animal47 studies have revealed that selective stimulation
of propionate production occurs after supplementation with oat products.
The beneficial effects of oat fibers on cholesterol levels might be
associated with this propionogenic effect. Propionate is transported
to the liver, where it reduces cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis48−50 and positively affects glycemic control.48,50 Propionate also participates in the regulation of immune function
in adipose tissue.51,52 The stimulation of specific health-related
microbial metabolites by the oat ingredients thus suggests that they
might be useful as prebiotic substrates.

Oat supplementation
strongly decreased branched SCFA and ammonium
production. The initial production of branched SCFAs occurred between
0 and 24 h. Branched SCFAs reached maximum levels between 24 and 48
h for all oat ingredients, but ammonium was mainly produced during
the first 24 h of incubation. The formation of branched SCFAs and
ammonium was likely due to the depletion of the product and the subsequent
shift to proteolytic fermentation. Because proteolytic fermentation
results in the production of toxic compounds such as p-cresol,53,54 highly branched SCFA and ammonium production
in the colon are associated with detrimental health effects. Their
reduction upon supplementation with the different oat ingredients
confirms the high fermentability of the test substrates, in this way
postponing proteolytic fermentation.

The results indicated that
during the final 24 h of incubation
there were strong correlations between lactate consumption and butyrate
production in the FOS and the tested oat ingredient samples. In general,
the consumption of lactate during the final 24 h was much lower for
the oat ingredients compared with FOS, and the highest production
of butyrate occurred with FOS supplementation. However, the non-consumed
amounts of lactate that remained at the end of the incubation period
was similar for all tested products, including FOS. Lactate is produced
by lactic acid bacteria and decreases the pH of the intestinal environment.55 Especially at low pH values, lactate can exert
strong antimicrobial effects against pathogens. Protonated lactic
acid can penetrate the microbial cell wall. It then dissociates and
releases protons into the cytoplasm, which results in acidification
and microbial cell death.56−58 Because of this antipathogenic
activity, lactate accumulation can be considered to be a health-promoting
prebiotic effect. Another beneficial effect of lactate results from
its conversion to the health-promoting SCFA butyrate.59 The accumulation of lactate at the end of incubation indicated
that there was a high potential for butyrate production by the oat
ingredients and FOS. In vivo, accumulated lactate levels would likely
be transported to the distal colon regions. Specific butyrate-producing
strains of bacteria such as Anaerostipes caccae and Eubacterium hallii could then
convert the lactate to butyrate.60 Because
many colonic diseases originate in the distal colon,61 the tested products (including FOS) could have a beneficial
effect by shifting a part of fermentation to the more distal regions
of the gastrointestinal tract.

The results for the tested oat
ingredients revealed the stimulation
of product-specific microbial pathways. The microbiome effects of
old-fashioned oats, instant oat flakes, pre-cooked oat flour, and
pre-cooked Morrison oat flour were similar. However, the microbial
interactions that occurred after treatment with oat bran and steel-cut
oats tended to be more different from the other oat ingredients. The
results for the use of steel-cut oats indicated that its effects were
similar to the negative control. The microbial pattern obtained when
oat bran was used was more closely related to the results for FOS
use. FOS stimulates the growth of Bifidobacterium species in the human colon.9,10 Among the oat ingredients
tested in this study, oat bran resulted in the highest bifidogenic
effect. Oat bran originates from the aleurone layers of the oat groats
and is the coarser fraction obtained after the groats are ground into
flour. Oat bran is characterized by high protein and total dietary
fiber content.62 It had the highest levels
of these components of all the oat ingredients tested in this study.
Steel-cut oats are produced by cutting the whole oat groats into smaller
pieces.62 Mechanical processing increases
the extractability of dietary fibers (e.g., β-glucans) from
the oat product,19 so the limited processing
and larger particle size of steel-cut oats could explain why the post-treatment
metabolic profile was more closely related to the negative control
than to the other oat ingredients. The low amount of total dietary
fiber and the highly branched SCFA and ammonium production after treatment
with steel-cut oats indicated a faster depletion of the product with
an associated shift to proteolytic fermentation53,54 and confirms this conclusion. Therefore, the results suggested that
there was an association between the total amount of production process-related
dietary fiber present in different oat ingredients and the prebiotic
potential of each ingredient.

Interpretation of the microbial
interactions that occurred after
treatment with different oat ingredients indicated that these interactions
were also donor-specific. Overall, the results for donor A were characterized
by a high initial fermentation rate and gas production (0–6
h) for FOS and all oat ingredients. Donors B and C had lower fermentation
and gas production rates. This result was confirmed by the high initial
propionate levels (0–6 h) for donor A, compared with donor
C and especially donor B. These differences indicated that the donors
had different primary substrate degraders. Propionate can be produced
by a wide range of gut microbes; Bacteroides spp.63,64 and Akkermansia muciniphila(65) are the most prevalent of the gut species that
produce propionate. A. muciniphila is
a mucin-degrading bacterium,65 while bacteria
belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum, are known
for their fiber-degrading potential.66 The
strong initial propionate production for donor A suggested that propionate
producers were relatively more prevalent in the starting fecal community
of this donor. The interindividual differences in microbial composition
were also indicated by the Lactobacillus spp. levels.
Donor B had very low initial levels, compared with donors A and C.
Taken together, the results indicated that although the overall post-treatment
microbial metabolism was similar between different donors, the differences
in microbial community composition affected the use of the oat ingredients
in a donor-specific manner.

In conclusion, the use of different
oat ingredients revealed that
there was stimulation of health-related microbial metabolites in the
gut microbiome. This result suggested that these ingredients might
be used as prebiotic substrates upon digestion. Overall, the levels
of health-related metabolites and Bifidobacterium spp. increased after treatment, but the different products were
associated with the stimulation of specific metabolic pathways and
changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. The results also
suggested that there was an association between the total amount of
production process-related dietary fiber present in different oat
ingredients and the prebiotic potential of each ingredient.

Materials
and Methods
Chemicals and Carbohydrates
All chemicals were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (Overijse, Belgium) unless indicated otherwise.
PepsiCo, Inc. (Barrington) provided different oat ingredients, which
were produced by the application of different processing techniques
(Table 1). All oat
ingredients started off as oat groats. Groats were roasted at low
temperature (80–100 °C) for stabilization before further
process. To obtain steel-cut oats, whole groats were cut into several
pieces. Due to the large particle size, these steel-cut oats take
the longest to cook. Old-fashioned oats were produced by steaming
the whole groats to make them soft and pliable, and then pressed to
flatten them obtaining a particle size of 0.51–0.76 mm. Furthermore,
steel-cut oats were used for the preparation of instant oat flakes.
They were heat-treated using steam and pressed slightly thinner than
old-fashioned oats obtaining a particle size of 0.36–0.46 mm.
Instant oat flakes were ground to smaller particle size and fine particles
of oat flour were removed using a sieving process yielding oat bran.
Pre-cooked oat flour was produced using PepsiCo proprietary process
providing ready-to-use format with improved dispersability. Granulation
range for the pre-cooked oat flour ranged from 50 to 250 μm
with targeting of 178–250 μm. All previously mentioned
oat ingredients started from the same lot of oats. Morrison oat is
a PepsiCo proprietary variety containing higher β-glucan and
protein than regular oat varieties. The Morrison oat flour was processed
in the same way as pre-cooked oat flour.

The positive control
for the study was FOS with a purity of 99%, and a degree of polymerization
>10.

In Vitro Digestion Experiments for Oat Ingredients and FOS
Digestion experiments were performed to produce relevant product
fractions of the six oat ingredients (Table 1) and that would also reach the colon. Blank
experiments were performed for two remaining conditions (i.e., blank
control (BNC) and FOS). The test ingredients were prepared according
to the manufacturers’ instructions (Table 1) and then were subjected to oral, gastric,
and small intestinal incubation. Incubation conditions were based
on the consensus digestion protocol, which was developed within the
large European-framework COST Action Infogest, with some improvements.
The oral phase was implemented as proposed by Mackie et al.,33 but at the beginning of gastric incubation,
the ingredients were diluted to obtain a concentration of 80 g DW/L
in the stomach and 56 g DW/L in the small intestine, corrected for
the moisture content after cooking. The enzyme versus product ratios
was maintained as proposed by the consensus method. Working with more
dilute aqueous matrices allowed improvement in the protocol; a pH
profile from 5.5 to 2.0 during gastric incubation was used to mimic
in vivo fed gastric conditions more closely. A dialysis approach (validated
for glucose and amino acids (data not shown)) was used for the simulation
of small intestinal absorption, and removal of small molecules (<3.5
kDa) from the intestinal digests. Dialysis was started after 30 min
of small intestinal incubation. The intestinal digest was added to
a dialysis tube (ZelluTrans/Roth dialysis membrane, regenerated cellulose,
molecular weight cut off 3.5 kDa), which was submerged in double the
volume of dialysis fluid (3.75 g/L NaHCO3; pH 7.0). During
the 3 h incubation, the dialysis fluid was replaced once each hour
with fresh fluid. This dialysis step was not included for the low
molecular weight FOS samples because it would have been lost during
the procedure.

Next, colonic incubation was initiated by adding
12.5 mL of the digested and dialyzed liquid from the small intestine
to 50.5 mL colonic background medium (4.45 g/L K2HPO4; 13.6 g/L KH2PO4; 2.5 g/L NaHCO3; 2.5 g/L yeast extract; 2.5 g/L peptone; 1.25 g/L mucin;
0.625 g/L l-cysteine HCl; 2.5 mL/L Tween 80) in 120 mL volume
penicillin bottles. When a product would entirely escape upper gastrointestinal
tract digestion and absorption, adding 12.5 mL of intestinal digests
would correspond to a maximum concentration of 10 g/L. When digestion
and absorption is taken into account, this would correspond to a dose
of approximately 5 g/L. A total of 5 g FOS/L was added as a positive
control. Anaerobiosis was obtained using N2 gas and alternation
between vacuum and overpressure conditions for 10 cycles. Each human
fecal inoculum that was subsequently prepared from each of the three
healthy volunteers (donor A = male, 30 years; donor B = male, 29 years;
donor C = male, 32 years) was a 1:13 (mass/volume) mixture of a freshly
collected fecal sample and anaerobic phosphate buffer (K2HPO4 8.8 g/L; KH2PO4 6.8 g/L; sodium
thioglycolate 0.1 g/L; sodium dithionite 0.015 g/L). After homogenization
(10 min, BagMixer 400, Interscience, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium) and
removal of large particles via centrifugation (2 min, 500g), 7 mL inoculum was added to the different bottles. The samples
were then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, and under 90 rpm agitation
conditions. Each experiment was performed in triplicate for each donor
and each treatment. As a remark, the human volunteers included in
the study were considered as healthy adults with a body mass index
between 20 and 25, following a general westernized diet and did not
take any antibiotic treatment for at least 6 months prior to fecal
donation.

Starch Determination Method
Total starch quantification
was performed using a commercially available enzymatic assay kit (Megazyme,
Wicklow, Ireland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, starch was converted to maltodextrins via thermostable α-amylase
at 100 °C; KOH and α-amylase were used for the conversion
of resistant starch. The maltodextrins were then hydrolyzed to d-glucose by amyloglucosidase. d-Glucose was oxidized
to d-gluconate, and the released hydrogen peroxide was measured
colorimetrically using peroxidase and the production of a quinoneimine
dye. Quantification of starch levels in the initial test ingredients
and at the end of the small intestinal incubation allowed for the
calculation of digestible and nondigestible starch fractions.

Microbial
Metabolic Activity Analysis
The pH (Senseline
F410; ProSense, Oosterhout, The Netherlands), gas (hand-held pressure
indicator CPH6200; Wika, Echt, The Netherlands), lactate (LA), ammonium
(NH4+), and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) measurements
were performed at 0, 6, 24, and 48 h after starting the colonic incubation.
Acetate, propionate, butyrate, and branched SCFAs (isobutyrate, isovalerate,
and isocaproate) were measured as described by De Weirdt et al.34 Lactate quantification was performed using a
commercially available enzymatic assay kit (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ammonium
analysis was performed as described by Van de Wiele et al.35

Microbial Community Analysis
At
0 and 48 h, the samples
were collected for microbial community analysis. Total DNA was extracted
as described by Boon et al.,36 with some
minor modifications. The DNA was extracted from a pellet of bacterial
cells originated from a 1 mL sample after centrifugation for 5 min
at 7700g. A Fastprep-24 device (MP BioMedicals, Illkirch,
France) was used for homogenization, which was performed twice for
40 s at 4 m/s; the sample was allowed to rest for 5 min between shakings.
Subsequently, the quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for Firmicutes, Lactobacillus spp., and Bifidobacterium spp. were performed using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each sample was analyzed in technical
triplicate and outliers (more than 1 CT difference) were
omitted. The samples were checked for correct melt curve peaks. The
standard curves for all of the different runs had efficiencies between
90 and 105%. Descriptions of the primers, temperature conditions,
and primer concentrations are presented in Supporting Information Table 1.

Statistical Analysis
The statistical analyses were
performed using Statistical Analysis Software version 9.4 (SAS Institute:
191 Cary, NC) and Minitab 17 Statistical Software (Minitab Inc; State
College, PA). A two-way analysis of variance (factors were oat ingredient
type and donor) was performed to investigate the effects of different
oat ingredients on microbial metabolic activities. Tukey’s
test was used for post hoc analysis. The significance level for all
statistical tests was α = 0.05.

Principal component analysis
was performed using Analyze-it (v4.51) software. The increase or decrease
from 0 to 48 h of incubation for each parameter (except for lactate,
which was split into two parameters, i.e., 0–24 h for production
and 24–48 h for consumption) was used to create a joint PCA
biplot.
