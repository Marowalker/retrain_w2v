Au
nanoclusters (NCs) with organothiolate protecting ligands are
a field of great interest and X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a useful
tool for the structure and property studies of these Au NCs. However,
the Au NCs normally show broad and low-intensity features in the gold
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) region, lowering the
sensitivity of the technique and making it difficult to use for the
analysis of Au NCs. In this work we report a sensitive gold L3-edge XANES study on the bonding properties of the newly discovered
Au30(SR)18 NCs utilizing a combined approach
of the first derivative XANES spectra and quantum simulations. First
derivative XANES spectra are compared with the well-studied Au25(SR)18 with the aim of determining the unique
features of Au30(SR)18. It is found that the
early XANES region of the Au NCs is significantly influenced by the
gold–gold bonding environment in the surface sites, as the
varying surface Au–Au bond lengths in Au25(SR)18 and Au30(SR)18 result in pronounced
difference in the first derivative XANES. These findings can be consistently
explained using site-selective quantum simulations of the XANES spectra
based on the Au NC structural models. The XANES method presented in
this work offers a useful tool for the sensitive analysis on structure
and bonding properties of Au NCs.

1 Introduction
Ultra-small Au nanoclusters
(NCs) protected with ligands have been
an area of interest in the field of nanotechnology as they are an
excellent candidate for a wide variety of potential applications,
including catalysis,1 sensing,2 and bioimaging.3,4 A particular
area of interest is Au NCs with protecting organothiolate ligands,
due to their high stability and the ability for their size and number
of atoms to be precisely controlled.5−7 One example of Au NCs
with protecting organothiolate ligands is Au25(SR)18 (Au25 for short).8 Au25 has been well studied, providing information on
its crystal structure,9 bonding properties,10 and electronic properties.11 As a result, Au25 serves as an excellent point
of comparison for newly discovered Au NCs, as parameters and properties
can be compared and contrasted with those of Au25.

The recently reported HCP-like Au30(SR)18 (Au30 for short) has been an area of interest as this
is the first time in a thiolate-protected Au NC that this core geometry
has been observed.12−15 Comparison with well-studied NCs such as Au25 could provide
insight into the electronic and bonding properties present in Au30, which can in turn allow for this NC to be used in various
applications in the future. Several techniques can be utilized to
analyze NCs, including mass spectroscopy, which can provide information
on the identity and number of atoms present in a NC, and X-ray crystallography,
which can provide detailed information on the structure of a NC.16,17 X-ray crystallography can prove challenging, however, as high synthetic
yield and purity are required for crystallography to be successful.
Another powerful technique that will allow for the determination of
these properties is X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). In particular,
XAS allows for X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy
to be conducted, which can provide information on the electronic and
bonding properties of the NC.18

However,
the Au-based XANES analysis has proved to be less useful
than analysis of other elements because of the broad and weak features
present in Au L3-edge XANES data, which makes it difficult
to differentiate between two NCs with a different structure.19−21 In this work a special technique is used based on the first derivative
of XANES spectra. This improves the sensitivity allowing for the differences
between the XANES spectra of two NCs to be clearly observed. To help
support the experimental data, quantum simulations are used to generate
theoretical XANES spectra using the known crystal structures of the
NCs, resulting in a combined approach of experimental data and quantum
simulations. To showcase this technique, Au30 is compared
with Au25 using this more sensitive first derivative technique,
which allows for subtle but significant differences between data sets
to be more clearly observed. Through experimental data and theoretical
simulations, the difference in bonding properties between Au30 and Au25 NCs is systematically studied from their core,
surface, and staple sites to provide a better understanding of the
properties of the recently discovered Au30 and to illustrate
the usefulness of this more sensitive first derivative technique for
XANES analysis.

2 Results and Discussion
The total structures of Au25 and Au30 are
shown in Figure 1a,d,
respectively.8,12 To more clearly see the local
structures, the staple sites are shown in Figure 1b,e, and core sites are shown in Figure 1c,f for Au25 and Au30, respectively. Note that “surface”
Au atoms are also sometimes referred to as “vertex site of
the kernel”. It can be seen that both NCs have a similar staple-capping
structure in the ligand shell, whereas the NC core geometry of the
two clusters isvery different (i.e., icosahedron for Au25 vs HCP for Au30).

Figure 1 (a) Total structure of Au25, (b) staple-like motifs
in Au25, (c) core structure of Au25, (d) total
structure of Au30, (e) staple-like motifs in Au30, and (f) core structure of Au30 (yellow: central Au;
purple: surface Au; blue: staple Au; red: sulfur).

In order to study the bonding properties of the
NCs, the Au L3-edge XANES of Au25 and Au30 are compared
in Figure 2a. A difference
in the near-edge region of regular XANES can be barely observed between
the two samples. To more clearly compare the differences of the XANES
features, the first derivative XANES of the two NC samples is exhibited
in Figure 2b. As shown
in the figure, significantly improved sensitivity can be achieved
in the comparison. Both NCs have a similar feature in the lower energy
region which is labeled as feature A. A new feature around 13 eV from
Au30 is observed and labeled as feature B. In order to
understand the origin of these XANES features, experimental first
derivative XANES is further studied by comparison with their site-specific
XANES simulations.

derivative
XANES of Au25 and Au30.

In order to perform a reliable comparison between
experimental
and simulated first derivative XANES, the well-studied Au25 is tested in the simulation. In Figure 3a, the experimental data of Au25 are displayed together with the site-specific simulations from the
surface, staple, and core sites. Feature A from the experimental data
exhibits a match with those from the simulated surface and staple
sites. These results prove that the simulation method is reliable.
It is also noted that when the simulated first derivative XANES is
calculated by the weight percentage, the simulation from the core
site has almost no contribution because of the negligible amount of
Au atoms.

Figure 3 (a) Experimental first derivative XANES of Au25 is shown
on the top. The simulated first derivative XANES generated from the
surface, staple, and core sites is shown on the bottom. (b) Comparison
of experimental first derivative XANES with simulated first derivative
XANES from surface, staple, and core sites of Au25 and
Au30. Note that the higher energy feature in the simulations
is not completely shown as the extended X-ray absorption fine structure
signal starts to appear in the higher energy region.

Next, the experimental first derivative XANES from
both NCs in
association with their site-specific simulations are shown in Figure 3b. It is found that
feature A from the experimental first derivative XANES in both of
the NCs is contributed to by the surface and staple sites. The unique
feature B from Au30 is significantly influenced by its
surface site. Specifically, the simulated XANES from the surface site
in Au30 shows a blue-shifted feature by comparing with
the feature from Au25 (“blue-shifted” and
“red-shifted” is used to describe the feature which
is shifted at higher and lower energy, respectively). This blue-shifted
feature in the simulation is consistent with feature B in experimental
data from Au30. Therefore, features A and B in the experimental
data from Au30 should correspond to the overlap of simulated
XANES from its surface and staple sites. The important contribution
from the surface site of Au30 leads to the unexpected feature
B. Therefore, the results from Figure 3b indicate that the difference in experimental XANES
is mainly influenced by the surface sites. Note that there is a small
mismatch in the peak position between feature A of the Au30 experimental data and the simulation of the staple site. However,
this mismatch does not influence the double-peak shape of the overall
simulated XANES.

To understand how the difference in the Au–Au
bond distance
of surface sites influences the XANES, the bond distance distributions
of representative surface sites of the NCs are plotted in Figure 4a,b. The corresponding
local structural models of surface sites are also presented. Note
that the entire bond distance distribution is reported, rather than
an average value for that bonding environment. It is clear that the
surface site from Au25 has considerably a longer averaged
Au–Au bond distance than the surface site from Au30. In order to better understand the relationship between variation
in the Au–Au bond distance and the location of peaks in the
XANES spectrum, the lattice expansion test is performed on the simulated
spectra. In this test, the simulated XANES from surface sites is compared
with simulations using the expanded Au–Au bond distance, that
is, all the bond distances are purposely expanded by 10% in the simulation.
In Figure 4c,d, the
simulations for both NCs exhibit a redshift when the Au–Au
bond distance increases. Therefore, these simulation results prove
that the blue-shifted first derivative XANES peak from Au30 (i.e., the feature B in Figure 2b) should be caused by the shorter Au–Au bond
distance from the surface Au site. As mentioned previously, this peak
mainly arises from the surface site, and so any variation in the Au–Au
bond length involving the center or staple atoms should have no effect
on the location of this peak.

Figure 4 Bond distance distribution of surface sites
in (a) Au25 and (b) Au30 is shown. The corresponding
surface site models are
exhibited on the right (the selected surface Au atoms for simulations
are enlarged; yellow: central Au; purple: surface Au; blue: staple
Au; red: S). The simulated bond distance tests of (c) Au25 and (d) Au30 are also exhibited. Note that there are
two types of surface sites in Au30 (i.e. Au30 top and Au30 middle) but only one type
of surface Au site in Au25.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, X-ray absorption
near-edge structure measurements
in association with theoretical calculations probed the unique bonding
properties of Au30 with comparison to Au25.
It was found that the early region in the first derivative XANES spectra
of the Au NCs is significantly influenced by the gold–gold
bonding environment in NC surface sites. These findings can be consistently
explained using quantum XANES simulations. This work demonstrates
that HCP-like Au30 NCs have unique bonding properties differing
from the icosahedron-like Au25 NCs. The first derivative
method was shown to have significantly improved sensitivity overall
regular XANES on the structural and bonding analysis of Au NCs, and
thus offers new opportunities toward more thoroughly understanding
the structure–property relationships of many other Au NCs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Au NCs
Au30 NCs were synthesized following a literature procedure.12 In the synthesis, 0.3 mmol of HAuCl4·3H2O and 0.348 mmol of TOAB were mixed together
and dissolved in 15 mL of methanol in a 50 mL round-bottom flask at
room temperature. The solution was stirred for 15 min, at which point
the color was observed to change from yellow to a reddish orange.
Next, 1.6 mmol of 1-adamantanetiol was added, changing the color to
a light yellow. The solution was left for 15 min, and then 3 mmol
of NaBH4 was added under vigorous stirring. After 1 week
of stirring, a black precipitate containing Au NCs was isolated from
the solution. The Au NCs were then washed with dichloromethane and
extracted from the residue using benzene. The yield was determined
to be approximately 20%. Au25 NCs were synthesized following
a well-established literature procedure.10

4.2 X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Au
L3-edge XAS measurements were collected in the transmission
mode at the Sector 20-BM beamline of the Advanced Photon Source, located
in Argonne National Laboratory in IL, U.S.A. Powder samples of the
Au30 NC were packed into Kapton film pouches, sealed, and
folded to ensure an adequate signal was obtained. A Au foil reference
was measured simultaneously for calibration of the energy of Au L3 absorption edge. XAS data were collected at room temperature
under normal conditions. XAS measurements of Au25 from
previous work were used for comparison with the new measurements of
the Au30 NC collected for this work.10

4.3 Data Analysis
The simulated first
derivative of XANES spectra in the three NCs were generated using
the FEFF8.2 computer code.22 In the comparison
between experimental first derivative XANES and site-specific simulations,
the simulated first derivative XANES of Au25 and Au30 was generated from the Au atoms in different surface, staple,
and core sites based on the published total structures.8,12 One Au site contains the selected Au atom and its connected Au or
S atoms. The types of Au sites are dependent on their bonding environment.
In the analysis, only one Au atom in each type of Au site was selected
and used in the simulation. Moreover, two surface and staple sites
were found in Au30. The other Au sites in the two NCs show
a single type of bonding environment. Furthermore, the y-axis of simulated first derivative XANES was normalized by multiplying
the value by weight percentage of each individual site (i.e., number
of Au atoms in each site/total number of Au atoms).
