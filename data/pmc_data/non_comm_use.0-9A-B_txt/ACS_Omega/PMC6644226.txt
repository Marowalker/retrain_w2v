Poly(vinyl
chloride) (PVC)/SiO2 nanocomposite hollow-fiber
membranes with different nano-SiO2 particle loadings (0–5
wt %) were fabricated using the dry-jet wet-spinning technique. Effects
of SiO2 nanoparticles on the morphology of the prepared
hollow-fiber membranes were investigated using scanning electron microscopy.
Transport and antifouling properties of the fabricated membranes were
evaluated by conducting pure-water permeation, solute rejection, and
fouling resistance experiments. These studies indicated that incorporating
silica nanoparticles into the PVC matrix during phase inversion lowers
the hydraulic resistance through the membrane and narrows the selective
membrane pores. Moreover, the nanocomposite membranes showed better
antifouling properties compared to the pristine membrane during the
ultrafiltration of a milk solution because of improved hydrophilicity
and uniform dispersion of the nanoparticles. This work indicates that
embedding silica nanoparticles into the PVC matrix is a promising
method for producing cost-effective hollow-fiber ultrafiltration membranes
with superior transport and antifouling properties.

1 Introduction
Ultrafiltration is a low-pressure
membrane process widely used
for separation and purification of various compounds and streams in
the food, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and water-treatment industries.1−5 Among polymers used in the fabrication of ultrafiltration membranes,
poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is attractive for its favorable chemical
resistance, mechanical properties, and lower price compared to polysulfone
(PSF), polyethersulfone (PES), and polyvinylidineflouride (PVDF).6 These advantages have motivated studies on its
application for polymer membrane fabrication.7,8 However,
its hydrophobicity promotes membrane fouling, restricting its application
in water purification.7,8 Membrane fouling lowers the flux
and efficiency of membrane separation processes,9−11 which have
to be regained by chemical cleaning. However, chemical cleaning increases
operating costs and lowers the membrane lifetime. As such, the fabrication
of membranes with superior antifouling properties is of great importance.12−14

Physical blending,15−18 chemical grafting,19,20 and surface
modification21−23 are among the techniques utilized for improving membrane
hydrophilicity,
and thereby antifouling properties of ultrafiltration membranes. For
instance, Panda and De17 investigated how
characteristics of the PSF ultrafiltration membranes are changed with
adding polyethyleneglycol (PEG) to the dope solutions. They reported
that an increase in the concentration and/or molecular weight of PEG
promoted the hydrophilicity and consequently antifouling properties
of the resulting hollow fibers. In another study, Zhao et al.20 grafted n-isopropylacrylamide
on the surface of PVDF membranes and created thermoresponsive membranes
with improved hydrophilicity, fouling resistance, and pure water flux
(PWF). Additionally, Abedi et al.21,22 significantly
improved the fouling resistance of polyacrilonitrile (PAN) membranes
using chemical surface modification.

In recent years, the use
of nanomaterials in the fabrication of
polymer membranes has attracted a lot of interest because of improved
performance of nanomaterial-based membranes.24−27 Yang et al.28 showed that the addition of 2 wt % TiO2 to a
PSF solution significantly enhances the PWF, hydrophilicity, mechanical
strength, and fouling resistance, whereas solute rejection remained
essentially unchanged. Yan et al.29 employed
PVDF/alumina ultrafiltration membranes for oil waste water treatment.
The modified membranes exhibited improved fouling resistance, and
in some cases, the flux recovery reached 100% after the chemical cleaning.
SiO2 nanoparticles have been used widely because of their
low cost, ease of preparation, excellent stability, and hydrophilicity.8,30,31 Shen et al.31 studied PES/SiO2 nanocomposite membranes for
raw water pretreatment. Their results suggested that the morphology
of the membranes was not affected significantly, whereas hydrophilicity
and antifouling properties were improved.31 Arthanareeswaran et al.32 investigated
the effect of silica on cellulose acetate (CA) membranes. The porosity
and the mechanical strength of the CA membranes were found to improve
with incorporating silica nanoparticles. Also, Jin et al.33 found that silica nanoparticles enhanced thermal
resistance, hydrophilicity, and flux of the ultrafiltration membranes.
Harun et al.34 investigated the effect
of synthetic silica with different concentrations on the morphology
and performance of PSF membranes. By embedding 2 wt % of silica a
high PWF and a high solute rejection were achieved simultaneously.
Yu et al.35 reported that the membranes
containing silica showed better performance in terms of permeability,
fouling resistance, and solute separation.

Previous studies
on the use of silica nanoparticles as fillers
and pore-forming agents in PVC membranes have focused mostly on flat-sheet
membranes.8,36 As fabrication processes of flat-sheet and
hollow-fiber membranes are governed by different nonsolvent-induced
phase separation mechanisms, leading to the fabrication of membranes
with different properties and structures.37 Therefore, our understanding of flat-sheet membranes cannot be applied
to hollow fibers, in general.37

This
paper presents a study of the effects of silica nanoparticles
on the morphology and performance of PVC hollow-fiber ultrafiltration
membranes. Silica nanoparticles with various concentrations were incorporated
into the PVC dope solutions. Subsequently, the solutions were spun
into hollow fibers employing the dry-jet wet-spinning method. The
resulting membranes were then characterized using thermal gravimetric
analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and attenuated
total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR),
to observe the influence of silica nanoparticles on the morphology
of the membranes. Furthermore, the separation performance of the ultrafiltration
membranes was determined through measurement of PWF and solute rejection.
Finally, fouling experiments were performed to evaluate the fouling
resistance of the membranes against milk as a model foulant.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 ATR–FTIR and TGA
The silica
nanoparticles may leave the membrane matrix during the spinning process.
To confirm that this did not occur, ATR–FTIR analysis was performed.
This analysis allows for qualitatively determining the percent of
nanoparticles trapped in the membrane network (Figure 1), where the M-0.0, ..., M-5.0 are defined
in Table 1. The strong
absorption band at 1104 cm–1 corresponds to the
asymmetric Si–O–Si stretching, corroborating the presence
of the nanoparticles within the membrane matrix. Additionally, as
the SiO2 content increases from 0.5 to 5 wt %, the relative
absorption intensity increases as well. This implies that the percent
of SiO2 nanoparticles trapped within the membrane structure
enhances with its concentration in the initial dope solution.

To determine the percent of the nanoparticles trapped in the membrane
network, TGA was carried out (Figure 2). Char yields of 13.84, 15.61, and 18.43% were observed
for M-0.0, M-2.5, and M-5.0 up to 600 °C, respectively. Considering
4% loss of the silica weight loss up to this temperature,38 silica concentrations of 1.84 and 4.78% were
obtained for M-2.5 and M-5.0 samples, respectively.

fabricated membranes.

2.2 Effect of Silica Nanoparticles on Membrane
Morphology
Cross-sectional images of the hollow-fiber membranes
are presented in Figure 3. Three main regions including the lumen side surface, the middle
region, and the outer surface were observed in the cross sections
of the hollow fibers. The addition of silica nanoparticles to the
PVC matrix led to an increase in porosity of the middle region. Additionally,
the cross-section morphology appears to become coarser with increasing
the percent of silica nanoparticles. As the polymer solution comes
into contact with each of the internal (bore liquid) and external
(coagulation bath) coagulation liquids, a high number of polymer-lean
nuclei are formed in both the lumen side and the outer side of the
hollow fiber, leading to the phase separation of the polymer solution.
The initial nuclei grow until the gelation (or vitrification) point.
Additionally, the rate of phase separation in these two surfaces,
especially in the outer surface, is significantly higher than that
in the bulk because of the presence of large amounts of nonsolvents
close to both surfaces contacting the coagulation liquids. Therefore,
due to the availability of less time for pore growth, the average
size of the final pores on the surface, which are the result of nucleation
and growth of the polymer-lean microdomains in the polymer-rich phase,
is smaller than that of the bulk.

Figure 3 Cross-sectional images of the PVC/SiO2 hollow-fiber
membranes with (a) 0.0, (b) 0.5, (c) 1.5, (d) 2.5, (e) 3.5, and (f)
5.0 wt % SiO2.

Because of the different compositions of the coagulation
liquids
in the lumen and outer sides, the porosity and the specification of
the pores in these layers are different (Figure 4). Compared to the lumen side, a tighter
and thicker layer was observed in the outer surface. A high amount
of the solvent [dimethylformamide (DMF)] in the bore liquid led to
a lower driving force for precipitation of the polymer in the lumen
side, constructing a layer with more porosity and larger connected
pores. Furthermore, the presence of DMF in the bore liquid slowed
the phase inversion in the lumen side and allowed more nuclei growth.
The transport of the nonsolvent molecules from the inner layer to
the middle layer increased the porosity of the lumen layer.

Figure 4 SEM images
of the (a) lumen surface and (b) outer surface of the
M-2.5 hollow-fiber membrane.

As the phase separation advances toward the middle of the
hollow-fiber
bulk, the resistance in the outer and inner surfaces of the hollow
fiber hinders the diffusion of the coagulant into the inner layers.
Therefore, the rate of phase separation in this region is relatively
low, and the polymer-lean nuclei formed in this region subsequently
form large macrovoids.8,35,39 The resistance of the outer and lumen side of the hollow fibers
hinders diffusion of water into the middle layer. Therefore, in this
layer, the nonsolvent concentration increases gradually, minimizing
the rate of phase separation in the middle layer. The nuclei in this
layer do not grow significantly because of the pressure exerted on
this layer by the adjacent large finger-like nuclei. Therefore, a
sponge-like morphology is observed in this layer.8,40,41

Silica nanoparticles act as nucleation
sites because of their hydrophilic
nature.42 Therefore, by incorporation of
these nanoparticles into the polymer solutions, the number of the
nuclei and the rate of phase separation increase drastically, with
ensuing smaller size of the final domains in both the lumen and outer
surface of the hollow fibers. This phenomenon also takes place across
the bulk of the hollow fibers; the presence of silica nanoparticles
enhances the nucleation in the bulk of the dope solution. Therefore,
the number of nuclei in the internal layers increases, resulting in
smaller but interconnected macrovoids compared to the pure PVC hollow
fiber. Additionally, because of the presence of the silica nanoparticles,
the phase separation in the middle regions occurs more homogenously,
engendering the suppression of the middle dense layer. As a result,
the relatively dense middle layer, which exists in the pure PVC membranes,
becomes looser.

Figure 5 presents
the cross-section micrographs of the PVC/SiO2 membranes
at a higher magnification. It can be observed that the silica nanoparticles
are distributed uniformly throughout the cross-section, verifying
the compatibility of the PVC and SiO2 nanoparticles. The
hydroxyl groups on the surface of the nanoparticles and the Cl groups
of the PVC chains can have polar interactions (Scheme 1).43,44 These interfacial interactions
improve the compatibility of the organic and inorganic phases.45 However, with an increase in the concentration
of the nanoparticles, the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate. The agglomerated
silica nanoparticles were enclosed in the coarse pores on the cavity
walls, blocking some of the pores almost completely (especially in
M-5). This leads to a reduction in the connectivity between the macrovoids.
The agglomeration of the silica nanoparticles is further amplified
at higher nanoparticle concentrations by their hydrophilic nature
and their tendency for phase separation from the polymer solution.

2.3 Effect
of Silica Nanoparticles on the Performance
of the Ultrafiltration Membranes
Solute rejection as well
as PWF results are presented in Table 2. As the table shows, higher silica contents in the
membranes provided higher solute rejections, indicating that the average
size of the selective pores decreased. Increasing PWF seems counterintuitive
at first sight, which can be attributed to the morphology of the membranes
described before.

sample	PWF (L·m–2·h–1)	PVA (30 kDa)	PVA (60 kDa)	PVA (145 kDa)

M-0.5	117 ± 4	23	77	100	
M-1.5	126 ± 2	30	80	100

M-3.5	137 ± 2	40	85	100	
M-5.0	87 ± 1	40	83	100	
The
improved rejection of the tested solutes indicated a decrease
in the average size of the selective pores. As described in the previous
section, the presence of the silica nanoparticles in the polymer solution
results in a higher number of nuclei in the phase separation process.
This leads to a higher number of final pores with smaller size, which
subsequently results in a higher rejection.8 On the other hand, increasing the nanoparticle content creates a
looser internal structure in the membranes, which consequently decreases
the hydraulic resistance against the water transport through the membranes.46 Therefore, the increase in PWF with nanoparticle
content can be attributed to the decrease in the hydraulic resistance
of the membrane bulk against water transport during the ultrafiltration
process as a result of the formation of a higher number of interconnected
pores. On the other side, improving solute rejection can be related
to the decrease in pore size on the selective surface (in our case,
the outer surface) of the membranes. It should also be noted that
the decrease in the value of PWF from M-3.5 to M-5.0 can be ascribed
to the increased hydraulic resistance against the water transport
through the membranes as a result of the blockage of the coarse pores
across the membrane bulk by the agglomerated nanoparticles.46 In addition to the hydraulic resistance effect,
the presence of OH groups on the surface of the silica nanoparticles
improves the hydrophilicity of the membranes, leading to higher PWFs
for the membranes that contain more nanoparticles (Figure 6), thereby facilitating the
water transport through the pores. The M-3.5 membrane rejects poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) 30 kDa slightly more than the M-2.5 membrane, whereas
the two membranes reject PVA 60 kDa and PVA 145 kDa similarly. Also,
M-3.5 showed a slightly higher PWF than M-2.5. Although the flux and
rejection of M-3.5 is a slightly higher than those of the M-2.5, M-2.5
was selected as the best membrane to compare its antifouling properties
with those of M-5.0 because of its easier fabrication process (easier
mixing of the less nanoparticles in the polymer dope).

2.4 Effect of Nano-Silica on the Antifouling Performance
of the Prepared Membranes
To evaluate the antifouling properties
of the modified membranes, the prepared membranes containing 0.0,
2.5, and 5.0 wt % silica were examined in the milk ultrafiltration
experiments. After 3 h of filtration of milk and cleaning of the tested
membranes, the water flux of the cleaned membranes was measured. Figure 7 depicts the milk
ultrafiltration flux as a function of time as well as the flux recovery
ratio (FRR) and relative flux reduction (RFR) results.

Figure 7 (a) Milk ultrafiltration
flux vs time for the pristine and modified
membranes and (b) changes of FRR and RFR for the pristine and modified
membranes.

As can be observed from Figure 7a,b, the value of
RFR decreased with embedding silica
nanoparticles, indicating the better resistance of the nanocomposite
membranes against fouling in the presence of milk. This can be attributed
to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface of
the silica nanoparticles, which increases the hydrophilicity of the
membranes (Figure 6), and consequently decreases the adhesion of the milk proteins to
the membrane surface. Moreover, according to Figure 7b, FRR increases with the incorporation of
silica nanoparticles, showing a decrease in irreversible fouling in
the studied membranes. As described above, because of the reduced
affinity between the membrane surface and the milk proteins, the adhered
proteins were more easily removed from the membranes, decreasing the
irreversible fouling. The improved antifouling properties can be attributed
to the increase in connectivity of the macrovoids in the presence
of the silica nanoparticles. The coarse structure facilitates the
removal of foulant from the membrane bulk by enhancing the internal
hydraulic flow across the membrane. Antifouling properties of the
PVC/SiO2 membranes are compared with other silica-based
ultrafiltration membranes reported in the literature, in Table 3. Bovine serum albumin
(BSA), PEG, and PVA solutions were used as foulant models. As can
be seen in the table, PAN/SiO2 and PVC/SiO2 membranes
rejected more than 80% of PEG 1000 and PVA 60 kDa, respectively. An
almost complete rejection of higher-molecular-weight foulants was
attained for these membranes. Furthermore, high BSA rejections of
more than 92% were observed for the silica-based nanocomposite membranes.

3 Conclusions
Defect-free hollow-fiber ultrafiltration
membranes were successfully
fabricated by embedding silica nanoparticles into the PVC matrix using
the dry-jet wet-spinning technique. Silica nanoparticles significantly
affected the morphology as well as the transport and antifouling properties
of the PVC membranes. The results suggest that the incorporation of
silica nanoparticles increased the number of nuclei in the phase separation,
leading to a decrease in the average size of the pores. As a result,
a higher solute rejection was achieved thanks to the silica nanoparticles
in the membrane network. Additionally, the modified membranes demonstrated
higher PWFs compared to the pristine membrane because of their looser
internal structures. However, increasing the nanoparticle content
beyond a certain concentration (∼3.5 wt %) decreased the PWF
because of the agglomeration of the nanoparticles and pore blockage.
Fouling experiments revealed that the positive effects of the nanoparticles
on membrane hydrophilicity provided better antifouling properties
for the nanocomposite membranes. This study points to the great potential
of the silica nanoparticles to defy high fouling of the PVC ultrafiltration
membranes as a major challenge of these membranes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
PVC
(grade: S-65) was supplied
by Abadan Petrochemical Co., Abadan, Iran, and was dried at 70 °C
for 30 min before use. DMF was purchased from Aldrich and was used
as the solvent for preparation of the polymer dopes. SiO2 nanoparticles with a mean particle size of 15 nm were purchased
from TECNAM, Italy. Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP-K90) was purchased
from Rahavard Tamin Co., Tehran, Iran, and was utilized as an additive
in preparing the dope solutions. PVA with molecular weights of 30,
60, and 145 kDa was obtained from Merck, Germany, to evaluate the
solute rejection of the membranes.

4.2 Membrane
Preparation
For preparation
of the dope solutions, silica nanoparticles with various concentrations
were dispersed in the solvent (DMF) via bath-ultrasonicating for 2
h at room temperature. PVC and PVP were then gradually added to the
suspension followed by 24 h rigorous stirring and ultrasonicating
to obtain a homogeneous dope solution. The compositions of the dope
solutions and names of the corresponding fabricated membranes are
listed in Table 4.

For the
preparation of the PVC/SiO2 nanocomposite hollow-fiber
membranes, the dope solutions were spun by the dry-jet wet-spinning
method at 25 °C. The bore liquid was a 15 wt % DMF aqueous solution.
After leaving the spinneret and traveling a 25 cm air gap, the solution
entered a coagulation bath containing pure water. Subsequently, the
membranes were collected in a washing bath containing pure water.
The fabricated hollow-fiber membranes were kept in a water bath for
24 h to remove the residual solvent, and subsequently were immersed
into a tank containing a 20 wt % glycerol aqueous solution for 24
h to prevent the porous structure from collapsing. Finally, the membranes
were dried at ambient air before conducting characterization and performance
experiments. The spinning conditions are summarized in Table 5.

4.3 Membrane Characterization
4.3.1 SEM, ATR–FTIR, TGA, and Contact Angle
Analyses
The morphologies of the prepared membranes were
examined using a SEM (KYKY, model: EM3200, China). The membrane samples
were fractured in liquid nitrogen and were gold-coated before visualization.
ATR–FTIR analysis of the samples was performed using a Bruker
TENSOR 27, IR spectrometer in the wavenumber range of 4000–600
cm–1. Prior to the experiments, the samples were
placed in a vacuum oven to remove the residual moisture. To quantify
the silica content of the membranes, TGA was performed with a thermogravimetric
analyzer (model TA Instruments TGA Q50) under ultrahigh pure nitrogen
and a heating rate of 10 °C/min. A ramé-hat automated
goniometer (model 290-U1) was employed to measure contact angles of
the membranes. Deionized water (3 μL) was dropped on the membranes
by a microsyringe at 25 °C. Five independent measurements were
made for each case; the average of the five measurements is reported
for each case in this paper.

4.3.2 Membrane
Performance Test
Flux
and fouling experiments were carried out using the setup shown in Scheme 2. For all performance
experiments, the membranes of each group were placed in a module using
epoxy resin. Each module contained eight hollow-fiber filaments. The
effective length of the filaments in each module was 20 cm, providing
an active membrane surface area of about 65 cm2. In all
of the tests, the flow configuration of the feed solution was set
in “out-to-in” mode, that is, the outer surface of the
membranes was exposed to the feed solution, and permeate was collected
from the lumen side. All of the performance experiments were carried
out at ambient temperature (25 ± 1 °C).

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation
of the Setup Used for Performing the Flux
and Fouling Experiments
4.3.2.1 Pure-Water Flux
Before the PWF
experiments, each module was pressurized with pure water at 3 bar
for 30 min. After that, the upstream pressure was reduced and the
experiments were performed at 2 bar. The permeate volume obtained
in each experiment, V (L), was used for calculating
the permeate flux, J (L·m2·h–1), using 1  where A (m2) is
the active surface area of the hollow fibers in the module and t (h) is the test time.

4.3.2.2 Fouling
Experiment
Fouling experiments
were performed to determine the impact of silica nanoparticles on
the fouling resistance of the prepared membranes as well as their
flux-recovery characteristics. Details of the utilized experimental
procedure can be found in ref (22). In these experiments, permeation fluxes of a pure water
and a milk solution (approximately 90.1 wt % water, 1.5 wt % fat,
and 8.4 wt % nonfat solid) streams were measured. First, the PWF of
the neat membranes was measured, followed by the measurement of the
milk solution flux (which was used to create fouling in the samples).
The PWF was measured again after backwashing the modules to remove
the reversible fouling. The measured fluxes of the pure water before
(Jw) and after (Jwuf) the milk filtration were subsequently used to determine
the FRR using 2  

Additionally, the permeation flux of
the milk solution (Jp) was used to determine
the RFR using 3  

The characteristics of the
milk solution used for this study are
identical to those reported in ref (22).

4.3.2.3 Solute Rejection Experiment
Solute
rejection tests were performed using aqueous solutions of PVA with
three different molecular weights of 30, 60, and 145 kDa at a concentration
(Cf) of 0.4 wt % (4000 ppm), a pressure
of 2 bar, and a temperature of 25 ± 1 °C. Details of the
employed experimental procedure can be found in ref (22). The solute rejection, R (%), was calculated using22 4  where Cp denotes
the concentration of PVA in the permeate solution.
