Cu clusters on ZnO have been prepared
by a simple low-temperature
solid-state reaction from their respective acetate precursors. The
formation of metallic Cu along with a small quantity of CuO was influenced
by the presence of the zinc acetate precursor. Although there is a
lack of formation of any metallic Cu in the absence of zinc acetate,
increase in the heating duration helps in the formation of increased
metallic Cu. A mechanism for formation of the Cu@ZnO nanocomposite
has been suggested. The prepared Cu@ZnO nanocomposite, with metallic
Cu, was identified by X-ray diffraction studies followed by confirmation
of clusters of the kind Cu9 and Cu18 by transmission
electron microscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The photoelectron spectroscopy is
able to clearly distinguish the Cu from CuO, which is very well complimented
by electron spin resonance analysis. The morphological feature of
ZnO changes from flakes to rods on increasing the duration of heating,
as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The observed
Cu plasmonic band in UV–vis diffuse reflectance gets blue-shifted
to 463 nm from its normally observed position of 550–580 nm
possibly due to cluster formation and interaction with ZnO, the band
gap of the latter getting red-shifted to 3.2–3.0 eV. The antibacterial
activity of the synthesized Cu cluster–ZnO nanocomposites was
investigated against Escherichia coli ATCC-25922 for Gram-negative and Bacillus cereus ATCC-10876 for Gram-positive bacteria. Tests were performed on a
nutrient agar medium and liquid broth supplemented with different
concentrations of nanoparticles. SEM analysis of the native and treated
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria established a high efficacy
of biocide activity in 24 h, with 200 μg/mL of Cu@ZnO nanocomposites.

1 Introduction
Noble
metal nanoparticles (MNPs)1,2 have found
innumerable applications in the field of medicine, energy, electronics,
manufacturing materials, catalysis, etc. Of the three noble metals,
namely, gold (Au), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu), Cu is the least expensive
and more abundant in nature. The noble MNPs exhibit entirely different
physicochemical properties from their bulk metal. Cu NPs find application
as a conducting medium in the form of conductive inks,3 lubricant additives,4 thermal
conductors,5 highly selective and efficient
catalysts in catalysis,6 fillers7 when added to plastics, coatings, and textiles,
and also as antibacterial agents.8 Other
practical applications of Cu NPs are biosensing,9 optical cloaking,10 superlensing,11 parasite therapy,12 etc. using the principles of plasmonics.13,14 Chemical reduction, microemulsion, photolithography, etc. are some
of the physicochemical methods15−30 employed for the synthesis of MNPs, which have mushroomed to a large
number in recent times. Of all of the above mentioned procedures and
methodologies, thermal degradation is the simplest and less time consuming
without using any expensive chemicals and an environmentally less
polluting method. In our current study, we report the preparation
of metallic Cu NPs along with ZnO by simple low-temperature solid-state
reaction of Cu and zinc acetate salts and study the effect of temperature
and duration of thermal treatment on the physicochemical properties
of NPs. It is of interest to note that ZnO-supported metallic Cu,
sometimes along with CuO, has been identified as clusters of the type
Cu9 and Cu18 using a variety of characterization
methods, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF).
The nuances of preparatory methods and characterizations of the prepared
Cu@ZnO nanocomposites are presented (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Preparation of Cu@ZnO nanocomposite materials.

Cu is an essential micronutrient required for normal functioning of the aerobic microorganisms.31 However, excess amount of Cu in the human body
causes Cu toxicity or copperiedus, which can be of a genetic or nongenetic
origin. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
maximum contaminant level of Cu in drinking water is 1.3 mg/L. About
0.9–1.3 mg/day is the recommended intake of Cu in North America.
Metal and metal oxide NPs, such as Ag, Au, Cu, TiO2, CuO,
ZnO, etc., are known to possess good antibacterial properties. Many
research works on antibacterial studies have shown that doped metal
oxide NPs have better antibacterial properties than those of undoped
ones.32−34 Cu as a biocide has been known since the metal age.
Cu and Cu-based NPs such as CuO and Cu2O have adequately
shown antibacterial effects in lesser amounts but toxic effect in
large amounts.35 Whereas one of the reports36 of the World Health Organization suggests an
acceptable intake of Cu to be approximately 1–1.5 mg/day.

Several studies report the nontoxic nature of ZnO NPs to human
cells.37−39 ZnO NPs are noxious to microorganisms, have good
biocompatibility to human cells, and are used as effective antibacterial
agents.40 ZnO NPs are also known to have
good antibacterial property and have been tested on a number of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria as well by varying different factors, such
as the concentration, particle size, and specific surface area.41,42 Hajipour et al.43 in their critical review,
discussed about the functioning of NPs against bacteria and their
role in antibacterial activity. A recent antibacterial study of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes by Bhuyan
et al.44 using pure and Cu-doped ZnO NPs
showed that Cu-doped ZnO NPs have superior antibacterial action than
that of pure ZnO NPs. In another study by Gupta et al.,45 on exposing the E. coli cells to N and Cu co-doped ZnO NPs under visible light irradiation, E. coli becomes inactive. The synergistic antibacterial
effect of Cu@T-ZnO nanocomposites for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria was shown by Yu et al.46 Most
importantly, the authors have positively proven them to have significant
potential as bactericidal agent,7 exemplifying
a biocidal action of these particles against E. coli ATCC-25922 and Bacillus cereus ATCC-10876.
The aim of this work was to study the interaction between bacteria
and NPs by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical method.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Studies Reveal the
Formation of Cubic Cu@ZnO Phase
The formation of metallic
Cu and ZnO were confirmed from XRD measurements of the nanocomposite
materials. Figure 2 shows the diffraction patterns of the composite material prepared
in air atmosphere at different exposure periods at 300 °C. It
was observed that the peaks at 2θ values, 43.3 (111), 50.4 (200),
and 74.1 (220), correspond to the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure
of metallic copper, according to JCPDS no. 851326. The intensity of
the Cu peaks increases from 1 to 3 h and decreases from 3 to 6 h on the basis of
the duration of exposure. It was also observed that very low intensity
peaks at 2θ values, that is, 36.5 (which is merged with the
ZnO peak) and 42.6, correspond to CuO, as realized from JCPDS no.
780428, to be an fcc one,47 and the presence
of Cu2+ was also confirmed from electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, vide infra). The
increase in the intensity of CuO on increasing the time period from
3 to 6 h suggests that the metallic Cu was being converted to CuO
and there is also a phase change of CuO from fcc to monoclinic end
center at 6 h of duration. The presence of monoclinic end-centered
CuO was confirmed from the XRD peaks at 35.7 and 38.9, according to
JCPDS no. 440706. At the same time, the ZnO peaks (2θ values
are 31.7, 34.3, 36.2, 56.5, and 62.7 corresponding to JCPDS no. 891397
of hexagonal wurtzite structure) show continuously increasing formations
of ZnO from 1 to 6 h. In the diffraction pattern of 1 h sample, there
is no formation of ZnO and they exist as acetates. On increasing the
reaction time, Zn acetate oxidizes into ZnO. Once the formation of
ZnO is complete, metallic Cu, which is present in the sample, starts
getting converted to CuO, as shown in the magnified XRD pattern for
S3 in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns
of Cu@ZnO nanocomposite materials prepared by
simple solid-state thermal degradation at different exposure periods
at 300 °C and that of (b) Cu@ZnO nanocomposite S3 sample showing
CuO peak at 2θ = 42.2 of the monoclinic type.

2.1.1 Proposed Mechanism for Metallic Cu Formation
It is understood from the works of Afzal et al.48 and Lin et al.49 that the final
products, ZnO from zinc acetate and a mixture of Cu2O and
CuO from copper acetate were obtained when heated separately. But
when zinc acetate and copper acetate were heated together at different
time durations at 300 °C, we got a mixture of acetates, metallic
Cu, Cu(II) oxide, and ZnO. More ZnO and CuO were increasingly formed
2 h onward. However, with no change in temperature but differing the
duration of the reaction until 5 h, we witness the formation of ZnO,
metallic Cu, and CuO at different ratios; CuO is formed only on heating
further to 6 h in air atmosphere, and it is easily inferred that only
metallic Cu gets oxidized to CuO, as known from both the reduced ratios
of Cu@ZnO and Cu/CuO (see Table 1) as compared to the S5 sample results.

Table 1 Ratio of Metallic Cu Peak to ZnO and
Cu2Oa
sample	Cu peak
(deg)	d-spacing (Å)	FWHM (Å)	Cu@ZnO peak intensity ratio	Cu/CuO peak intensity
ratio	particle size (nm)	
S1	43.4	2.07	0.14	12.75	 	62.5	
S2	43.5	2.08	0.20	11.32	 	44.5

S4	43.4	2.08	0.10	2.22	8.88	86.1	
S5	43.2	2.08	0.09	1.822	9.00	93.3	
S6	43.4	2.09	0.13	1.14	4.30	66.9	
a S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 are samples
with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h of heating, respectively.

To understand better the reaction
mechanism of the formation of
metallic Cu and the part played by both zinc and Cu acetates, we kept
the amount of Cu acetate (0.5 g) as a constant and changed the quantity
of zinc acetate, that is, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 g in separate
experiments. After the formation of the products, they were analyzed
for XRD studies, and the results are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of Cu@ZnO nanocomposite prepared
by varying the amount
of zinc acetate at 300 °C for 3 h.

From Figure 3, it
can be found that metallic Cu forms first in the mixture, followed
by ZnO and a relatively small quantity of CuO simultaneously. The
metallic Cu to cupric oxide ratio (peak positions 43.3–42.6)
increases as we increase the amount of zinc acetate. The most possible
reason could be that Cu acetate starts decomposing at 115 °C,
whereas zinc acetate decomposes at 237 °C. Hence, metallic Cu
forms initially on top of zinc acetate, which then decomposes to form
ZnO-supported metallic Cu. During the reaction condition, as the zinc
acetate gets converted to ZnO, part of the metallic Cu gets exposed
to air atmosphere and gets converted to cupric oxide. This is very
evident when the amount of zinc acetate increases from 0.05 to 0.75
g. As one can observe from Figure 3, as the amount of zinc acetate increases, the formation
of cupric oxide is less and the intensity of metallic Cu is more.
This by itself proves that more the amount of zinc acetate, the higher
the metallic Cu content. Also, the larger amount of ZnO seems to protect
the metallic Cu clusters getting oxidized.

Furthermore, it is
necessary to point out that metallic Cu is formed
on heating Cu acetate only in the presence of zinc acetate at a higher
temperature and longer duration. Heat treatment of pure Cu acetate
forms only CuO and Cu2O, without any trace of metallic
Cu at 300 °C. The formation of metallic Cu, as suggested by Afzal
et al.48 and Lin et al.,49 has been taken into consideration in the proposed mechanism,
as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Proposed Reaction Mechanism Depicting the Formation of Metallic
Cu
in the Presence of ZnO
It may, however, be pointed out that a somewhat different
method
of making Cu in ZnO ended up with the formation of Cu-doped ZnO,44 which is distinctly different from metallic
Cu in the form of clusters having plasmonic property (vide infra)
on the substrate of ZnO, as reported here. In another report, Cu and
N are co-doped in ZnO by the solution combustion method.45

2.2 XPS Study Confirms the
Formation of Metallic
Copper (Cu0) and CuO (Cu2+)
To further
confirm the presence of metallic Cu, XPS studies performed (survey
spectrum shown in Figure S1) show the presence
of zinc, Cu, and oxygen in the composite material. The region pertaining
to copper and zinc was scanned highly for detection of the oxidation
state of the elements. In Figure 4a, the peak position at 932.7 and 933.4 eV corresponds
to Cu0 and Cu2+ states, respectively. From the
Cu LMM analysis in Figure 4b, the deconvoluted peak showed the presence of Cu0 at 916.4 eV and Cu2+ at 915.5 eV. This confirms the presence
of metallic Cu and CuO, as obtained from the XRD measurements, as
confirmed from the literature resources of Thermo Scientific.50

(a) and Cu_LMM (b) region.

2.3 SEM Analysis Reveals Flakes and Rod-Like Structures
of Cu@ZnO
From the SEM analysis of the Cu@ZnO nanocomposite
materials, it was observed that the surface morphology of the analyzed
samples showed different structures. From Figure S2, the S3 sample showed flake-like structures, whereas the
S5 sample showed rod- as well as flake-like structures. The transformation
from flakes to rod structure seems to be rather slow and incomplete.

2.4 Confirmation of Cu2+ in Cu@ZnO
Nanocomposites by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Studies
X-band
ESR studies of the Cu@ZnO nanocomposite materials show the spectra,
as shown in Figure 5a,b. The g values, 1.99 and 1.95 m, respectively,
correspond to shallow donors, such as zinc interstitials (Zni), conduction band electrons (CBe–),
and oxygen vacancies (VO).51,52 It is clearly
evident from Figure 5a,b that S3 sample has less intensity than that of S5 sample at both
the g values, 1.95 and 1.99. It can be said that
at g value = 1.95, S3 sample had less concentration
of VO compared to that in the S5 sample. The conduction
band electrons, CBe–, or native defect,
Zni, that is, the shallow donors at g =
1.99 increase with increase in the reaction time. From the XRD pattern
(Figure 2), it can
be seen clearly that there is conversion of metallic Cu into CuO in
S5 sample. This is the general observation at all heating durations
except at 6 h.

Figure 5 X-band ESR spectrum of the nanocomposite material, Cu@ZnO
S3 (a)
and S5 (b) at 77 K.

Generally, a higher duration of heat
treatment leads to the conversion of metallic Cu to CuO; the formation
of CuO is such that the EPR of Cu2+ is fairly prominent.
More VO is created because of the greater use of oxygen
by metallic Cu to form the oxidation product, CuO. The spectral features
at fields lower than that of the conduction band are due to CuO.

2.5 MALDI-TOF Study Confirms the Formation of
Cu9 and Cu18 Clusters
Metallic Cu cluster
formation on the surface of ZnO was confirmed by analyzing the Cu@ZnO
nanocomposite materials using MALDI-TOF studies, with dithranol as
the matrix. The results are shown in both Figure 6 and in the Supporting Information, Figure S3 (survey spectrum).
There are two series of major peaks observed in the m/z range of 500–1500. They, respectively,
are part of the Cu9 and Cu18 clusters, with
each peak corresponding to a combination of isotopic distribution,
with 63Cu (62.92 amu, 69.17%) and 65Cu (64.92
amu, 30.83%), with the natural abundances given in parenthesis. It
is necessary to mention that all S1–S4 samples give identical
MALDI spectra. In S5 and S6 samples, there is inclusion of oxygen
with the copper clusters, which may have been responsible for the
resultant formation of CuO. It is necessary to comment on the analysis
of MALDI spectral m/z range of 574–581
as well as 1154–1162. Although we could easily and directly
identify the Cu9 and Cu18 clusters with differing
masses of Cu63 and Cu65, as marked in Figure 6a,b, respectively,
the alternating peaks can be identified by only one of the following
rationale: (i) if we can include ZnO, we can assign them to four copper
clusters and four ZnO; (ii) the alternating unassigned peaks (*) can
be the protonated form of the earlier peak, justifying its increase
by 1 amu due to the capture of a proton from the dithranol matrix.
The latter was found to be correct because an exactly similar spectrum
was obtained for metallic copper clusters in the absence of ZnO,53 as shown in Figure S4. It is observed from Figure 6a,b that the abundance of the Cu9 cluster is about
10 times that of the Cu18 cluster.

Figure 6 MALDI-TOF spectra of
Cu@ZnO nanocomposite material S3. The mass
spectra of Cu clusters Cu9 and Cu18 are shown
in (a) and (b), respectively. The numbers in parenthesis (x, y) refer to the number of 63Cu and 65Cu atoms, respectively, for some clusters. The
unmarked ones (*) are the protonated forms of the earlier peaks.

2.6 TEM Analysis
Reveals ZnO-Supported Cu Cluster
An HRTEM analysis of S3
sample is shown in Figure 7, which reveals formation of the Cu cluster
on ZnO surface. In Figure 7a, one can find
the Cu cluster embedded in the ZnO surface, with cluster size of diameter
3.90 nm, in the form of quantum dots. Figure 7b shows the measured d-spacing values, such
as 0.28, 0.24, and 0.26 nm corresponding to the (100), (002), and
(101) phases of the hexagonal Wurtzite ZnO structure, respectively.

electron micrograph showing Cu cluster (a) and d-spacing
values of ZnO (b) in S3.

2.7 Blue-Shifted Copper Plasmon Coupled with Redshift
in the ZnO Band Gap
The Cu@ZnO nanocomposite materials that
were prepared at 300° at different time periods were studied
for optical property in the reflectance mode. Figure S5 shows the UV–diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(DRS) spectra in absorbance scale for the commercial ZnO, ZnO from
zinc acetate, and all of the Cu@ZnO nanocomposite materials. The band
gap for the commercial ZnO and ZnO prepared from zinc acetate was
calculated to be 3.26 eV, an accepted value in the literature. The
band gap of ZnO in the nanocomposite materials gets red-shifted from
3.26 eV to less than 3.0 eV.

The Cu plasmonic band was generally
observed at 550–580 nm. The metallic Cu in our experiment shows
its surface plasmon resonance band at around 473 nm for all of the
Cu@ZnO nanocomposite materials, as shown in Figure S5. As the reaction time increases, formation of CuO is observed,
as there is absorption peak in the spectra as well as in XRD at around
550–580 nm (2.25–2.13 eV). Figure 8 shows the KM function of the spectra depicted
in Figure S5. Almost all of the nanocomposite
materials studied here showed the Cu plasmonic band at around 473
nm (2.63 eV), a case of blueshift. Repeated experiments show shifts,
as shown in Figure 8. The plasmon band seems to originate from the Cu clusters located
on the surface of ZnO, as verified by both TEM and MALDI measurements
(vide supra).

Figure 8 KM function of the UV–DRS spectra of nanocomposite,
Cu@ZnO
materials, commercial ZnO, ZnO(C), and the ZnO prepared from zinc
acetate, ZnO(Ac).

The band structures of
metallic Cu and ZnO are shown in Figure 9. From the band structure,
one can understand the interaction between metallic Cu and ZnO. It
is a well-known fact that the work functions of metallic Cu and ZnO
are φCu = 4.53 eV and φZnO = 5.2
eV, respectively. When Cu and ZnO come together to make metal–semiconductor
contact, electrons from n-type ZnO move toward Cu and a space charge
region is created. But in the seminal paper by Bardeen54 and Tung,55 it is
said that there will be metal-induced gap states or polarization of
the bond at the MS interface takes place during the chemical bonding
of the metal (Cu) and semiconductor (ZnO). The metal (Cu) donates
a large quantity of charge that is absorbed by the highly dense surface
states in the semiconductor (ZnO). Henceforth, the semiconductor bands
align to a new band level according to the density of the surface
states, which pins the Fermi level. This change in the fermi level
shows a reduction in the band gap energy of ZnO when in contact with
Cu, substantiating the observed redshift. In the same analogy, because
Cu had donated charges to ZnO in this case, the free electrons responsible
for plasmons become more tightly bound to cause the observed blueshift.

(lower) coming into contact.

2.8 Highly Effective Biocidal Activity of Cu9, Cu18@ZnO, ZnO, Cu, Cu + ZnO
The antibacterial
activity of the synthesized Cu@ZnO nanocomposites at different time
intervals (S1, S2, S3) were evaluated using the standard well diffusion
method. On the basis of the results of our preliminary experiments,
sample S3 (as shown in Figure 10), exhibited a larger zone of clearance as compared
to that of S1 and S2 (data not shown). It was observed that the zone
of inhibition was in the order of S3 > S2 > S1, which can be
explained
due to the increased content of metallic copper with an increase in
time.

Figure 10 Antibacterial in vitro effect of Cu@ZnO nanocomposites (S3) at
four concentrations on E. coli (top)
and B. cereus (bottom).

On the basis of the promising results of the plate
assay, S3 sample
was selected to study the dynamics of bacterial growth in a liquid
nutrient medium inoculated with E. coli (∼104–105 cells/mL) and supplemented
with varying concentrations of these nanocomposites in separate experiments.
One control flask was also maintained, which did not have any nanocomposites.
The treated bacterial samples were withdrawn at an interval of every
4 h, and the optical density was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm.
The above experimental procedure was followed for the Cu@ZnO nanocomposites
to find the antibacterial activity against B. cereus also and compared with that in pure ZnO, pristine Cu, and a physical
mixture of pure ZnO and pristine Cu.

In the case of E. coli, as seen
in Figure 11a, the
flask which was added with 100 and 125 μg/mL of nanocomposites
exhibited a nearly similar growth pattern as that of control, which
indicated that there was negligible inhibition in growth due to the
addition of nanocomposites. However, with an increase in its concentration,
there was an increased inhibition in the growth of E. coli, which suggests that inhibition takes place
at higher concentrations of the Cu@ZnO nanocomposites. Nevertheless,
the flask added with 200 μg/mL of the nanocomposites exhibited
complete inhibition in the growth of bacterial cells. For all of the
concentrations tested, it was observed that the stationary phase started
by the eighth hour of inoculation.

Figure 11 Growth pattern of E. coli- (a) and B. cereus- (b) treated Cu@ZnO
nanocomposites (S3)
as compared to control for 24 h duration.

In the case of B. cereus (Figure 11b), a similar trend
was observed, wherein the flask containing 25 and 50 μg/mL of
the nanocomposites had a meager inhibition in growth. However, when
100 μg of the nanocomposites were used, an inhibition by almost
50% was observed as compared to that in control followed by 200 μg/mL
of the nanocomposites.

The interesting features observed in
the inhibition patterns of
both the organisms tested are as follows:1. In the case of E. coli, it was seen that when a concentration of 100 μg/mL of the
nanocomposites were used, it showed comparable results to that of
control, which indicates that a concentration lower than this may
be inadequate to completely inhibit the growth of E.
coli. Nevertheless, a concentration of 200 μg/mL
of the nanocomposites was highly effective and showed a complete inhibition
in their growth, even at lower time scales.

2. In the case of B. cereus, a different trend was observed, wherein an appreciable amount of
inhibition was observed even with a concentration of 75 μg/mL.
However, it was also interesting to note that unlike E. coli complete inhibition was not achieved even
at a concentration of 200 μg/mL.

3. Pristine ZnO alone seems to be playing
a larger role in inhibiting the growth of B. cereus compared to that of E. coli (cf. Figures 11a and 11b). However, the presence of Cu in Cu@ZnO plays
a major role in the destruction of E.coli and a minor role in that of B.cereus. It is also quite exciting to find that in both Gram-positive as
well as Gram-negative organisms ZnO gives a bacteriostatic effect
in the initial stage of inoculation, after which the OD value increases.
Some reports suggest that this could be due to the surface defects
on ZnO.56



From these inferences and from the works of Yu et al.,46 one can confirm that the presence of both Cu
and ZnO in the nanocomposite plays a synergistic effect in inhibiting
the growth of bacterial cells, revealing the importance of Cu in the
nanocomposite.

To further confirm the results, SEM analysis
was used to evaluate
the surface morphology of both the native and treated E.coli and B. cereus in the nutrient medium. The treated bacterial cells were significantly
changed and showed total damage in their cell walls that were destroyed
and rough (Figure 12). The growth inhibition trend, as observed in the results of optical
density measurement in liquid medium for both the organisms, was in
good agreement with the SEM images. The above SEM analysis is
consistent with the reports of Raffi et al.57 More importantly, it must be said that although we have reported
the total cell destruction with the use of 200 μg/mL of nanocomposites,
the destruction seems to happen at a much earlier stage, even though
the experiment was continued for 24 h.

Figure 12 SEM image of control
and that treated with 200 μg/mL of Cu@ZnO
nanocomposites (S3) of E. coli and B. cereus cells just at 8 h of inoculation.

2.8.1 Assessing the Inhibiting
Effect of Cu@ZnO
To assess which component in the nanocomposite
(Cu or ZnO) plays
a significant role in inhibition, we further conducted the experiment
in a liquid medium with pristine ZnO, pristine Cu, physical mixing
of pristine ZnO and Cu, and Cu@ZnO nanocomposites. The antibacterial
results are given in Figure S6a,b.

From Figure S6a, it is seen that ZnO does
play a role as a bacteriostatic agent till 12 h of the experimental
period, after which the bacterial cells start growing, as inferred
from the increase in the OD values. When pristine Cu is used, the
inhibition effects are much less probably due to the aggregation of
nanocomposites, as a consequence lesser surface area is available
for active inhibition or/and this could be due to the consumption
of pristine Cu by the bacterial cell at concentrations of 100 and
200 μg/mL. However, with increase in time, the latter is seen
to inhibit growth of the bacterial cells. A comparison of pristine
Cu with pristine ZnO reveals that the former has a lower level of
activity than that of the latter. Simple physical mixing of equal
amounts (100 μg/mL) of pristine ZnO and pristine Cu, gives a
bactericidal effect, and there is complete mineralization of the bacterial
cell medium. After 48 h the entire medium transforms to a green transparent
solution, which is due to the presence of Cu2+ ions in
the solution. The other physical composition (Cu 165 μg/mL +
ZnO 35 μg/mL) shows no effect till 8 h of experiment, but later
there is a sudden decline in the OD values suggesting that bacterial
cells are killed partially.

In Figure S6b, the antibacterial effect
against Gram-positive B. cereus is
presented. For ZnO at higher concentration (200 μg/mL), physical
mixing of pristine Cu and pristine ZnO showed very good antibacterial
effect. Pristine Cu at higher concentration shows good results only
in the later stage of the experiment. But the physical mixture of
pristine Cu (165 μg/mL) and pristine ZnO (35 μg/mL) completely
mineralizes the liquid broth medium after 48 h. Even 100 μg/mL
each of pristine Cu and pristine ZnO yield good antibacterial results
but not as good as the former combination.

The mechanism of
antibacterial activity of NPs is still not clearly
understood, although cell-wall damage due to Cu ions58 and hydrogen peroxide production from Cu59 and ZnO40 are likely possibilities.

A comparison showing superiority of the current studies over the
earlier reports is given in Table 2. Similar observations, although not as efficient as
ours, have been reported by Raffi et al.,57 in studying the antibacterial behavior of Cu NPs against E. coli. The sensitivity of bacteria toward Cu NPs
was found to vary depending on the type of species. Recently, different
investigators have reported the antimicrobial effect of Cu NPs against
different bacterial strains.12,57,60,61 The cell death reported in this
study is substantially higher than that reported by the use of other
Cu-doped ZnO.44−46 Absolute cell death occurs probably by reactive oxygen
species mechanism due to the synergetic effect of both metallic Cu
clusters and ZnO in the case of E. coli, as already confirmed by Yu et al.46 We
attribute this greater inhibitive effect for E. coli than that for B.cereus to the difference
in cell-membrane structures, as supported by Yu et al.46 An additional advantage of Cu9,18@ZnO reported here is that the synthetic procedure is very simple
and consumes less time and energy. The antibacterial activity could
further be activated with the application of visible light, as reported
by Gupta et al.,45 wherein the Cu plasmon
is expected to play a major role along with ZnO, which will be investigated
in the near future.

3 Conclusions
Cu@ZnO nanocomposites were produced by
low-temperature solid-state
reactions of Cu and zinc acetate combinations, as a function of heating
duration. Interesting Cu clusters in the form of Cu9 and
Cu18 clusters were found on the surface of ZnO that resulted
in a blue-shifted copper plasmonic band and red-shifted ZnO band gap,
showing a strong interaction between the two species in the nanocomposites.
Antimicrobial studies revealed that the synthesized Cu@ZnO nanocomposites
were capable of destroying the bacterial cell wall, eventually degrading
the cytoplasm leading to cell death. The antibacterial activity may
be attributed mainly due to the strong adsorption of positively charged
Cu ions to bacterial cells, which imparts antibacterial efficacy in
a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, it is the synergistic
effect of both Cu and ZnO, present in the nanocomposites, that leads
to the bactericidal effect and not bacteriostatic effect. The authors
have contemplated to study bactericidal effects of the Cu@ZnO nanocomposites
using light therapy to check the possible effects of Cu plasmon.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Experimental Methods
4.1.1 Preparation of Cu@ZnO Nanocomposite Material
Metallic
salt precursors, such as Zinc acetate dihydrate (0.5 g)
and Cu acetate monohydrate (0.5 g), are taken in a silica crucible.
They are mixed thoroughly using a pestle and mortar. The silica crucible
along with its contents was placed in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere
without closing the crucible. The thermal degradation (decomposition)
process was initiated by setting the temperature to 300 °C, increasing
at the rate of 4 °C per min. After reaching 300 °C, the
reaction was allowed for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h, respectively. It
was observed that after the respective reaction time periods, the
color of the mixture turns from bluish-green to brown. After the sintering
process, the synthesized materials were collected and grounded using
pestle and mortar. The samples were labeled S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and
S6 for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h reaction time periods, respectively.
The preparation of Cu@ZnO nanocomposites is shown in Figure 1.

4.2 Characterization
XRD patterns were
recorded for the synthesized composite materials using Rigaku smartlab
in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The surface morphology
of the materials was analyzed using FEI quanta FEG 200 SEM. XPS measurements
were done using an Omicron ECA probe spectrometer, with polychromatic
Mg Kα X-rays (hν = 1253.6 eV). ESR analyses
of the Cu@ZnO nanocomposites were analyzed for oxygen vacancies and
conduction band electrons using JEOL model JES FA200. MALDI-TOF analysis
was done using a Bruker ultraflextreme equipped with a pulsed IR laser,
with 337 nm wavelength; the mass spectra of the Cu@ZnO nanocomposite
materials were recorded in the positive reflection mode. A high resolution
TEM (HRTEM, JEOL model 3010) was used for the identification of cluster
formation and to measure the lattice distance. The band gap of the
composite materials was measured using Jasco 650 along with the spherical
accessory using the principles of DRS.

4.3 Bactericidal
Test
4.3.1 Well Diffusion Method
To study
the bactericidal effect of synthesized Cu@ZnO nanocomposites (S1,
S2, and S3) against Gram-negative E. coli ATCC-25922 and Gram-positive B. cereus ATCC-10876, a loopful of these were inoculated in liquid medium
and incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 16–18 h. Around 200
μL of these young cultures was spread on nutrient agar plates.
Wells of 4 mm were bored with a cork borer under sterile conditions.
The Cu@ZnO nanocomposites were dispersed in presterilized deionized
water by ultrasonication. Around 25 μL of these samples was
added to the wells, which contained different concentrations of 12.5,
25, 37.5, and 50 mg/mL of nanocomposites and were incubated at 35 ±
2 °C. The plates were observed for formation of the zone of clearance.

4.3.2 Liquid Broth Method
To examine
the bacterial growth rate and to determine the growth curve in the
presence of Cu@ZnO nanocomposites, a freshly grown axenic culture
of E. coli (104–105 cells/mL) was inoculated into flasks containing the liquid
nutrient medium supplemented with different concentrations of nanocomposites
ranging from 100 to 200 μg/mL. These flasks were incubated at
35 ± 2 °C at 150 rpm in an orbital shaking incubator. The
total volume of the liquid medium in each flask was kept at 50 mL.
All experiments were performed in triplicate under sterile conditions.
Samples were taken periodically (at regular intervals of 4 h) from
the flasks to measure optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm, using
UV–vis spectrophotometer. A similar experiment was carried
out with B. cereus except that the
concentration of the nanocomposites ranged from 25 to 100 and up to
200 μg/mL.

4.3.3 SEM Analysis
Bacterial cells treated
with and without Cu@ZnO nanocomposites were collected by centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. The bacterial cell biomass was fixed
with 0.25% glutaraldehyde and subsequently treated with increasing
gradients of ethanol for fixing on aluminum stubs, which were air
dried in desiccators before coating with a thin layer of gold. Samples
were analyzed by SEM (FEI Quanta FEG 200).
