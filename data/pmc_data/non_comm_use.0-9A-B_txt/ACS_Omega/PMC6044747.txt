Magnetic
nanocomposite hydrogels show high potential to improve
tissue engineering. In this study, a magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel
was prepared from poly(vinyl alcohol), nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA),
and magnetic nanoparticles (Fe2O3) using the
ultrasonic dispersion method and freeze–thaw cross-linking
molding. The water content and crystallinity of the magnetic nanocomposite
hydrogel were tested. Microscopic morphology assessment, mechanical
testing, and characterization were performed. Additionally, the magnetic
nanocomposite hydrogel was co-cultured with bone mesenchymal stem
cells (BMSCs) to determine its cell compatibility. We found that the
magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel had good mechanical properties and
that its mechanical properties were enhanced by the addition of n-HA.
The BMSCs showed uniform growth on the surface of the magnetic nanocomposite
hydrogel and high rates of proliferation. BMSC growth was also enhanced
by the addition of Fe2O3 and also significant
stimulated chondrocyte-related gene expression. Thus, the magnetic
nanocomposite hydrogel scaffold material we describe here could have
broad applications in cartilage tissue engineering.

1 Introduction
Articular cartilage defects
are one of the most common forms of
orthopedic disease and are challenging to treat in the clinic. Articular
cartilage must be replaced after injury or lesion because it has limited
ability to self-repair. The emergence of bioengineered cartilage brings
hope for patients with articular cartilage defects. Tissue engineering
of cartilage requires an appropriate scaffold material, which cannot
only temporarily replace or repair the tissue but also provides a
growth environment for seed cells. The chemical composition and the
physical structure of the scaffold material affect the rate of cell
proliferation and differentiation, as well as maintenance of cell
phenotype.1 Injectable hydrogel is a scaffold
material with the capacity to self-model, which can be used to fill
tissue defects of different shapes and sizes, with minimal trauma.
Cells can distribute uniformly in a hydrogel scaffold and grow in
three dimensions. Hydrogel provides a bionic environment,2 and its high water content supports the exchange
of nutrients and cellular metabolites. poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel,
a water-soluble polymer that is hydrolyzed from polyvinyl acetate,
is prepared using the repeated freeze–thaw cross-linking molding
process. With high water content, high water absorption, excellent
biocompatibility, flexibility, and high elasticity, it can substantially
reduce the stimulation of cells and tissues. Additionally, when the
damaged articular surface repaired with PVA hydrogel to form a neocartilage
tissue could resemble the native cartilage, it is an ideal artificial
cartilage implant material.3,4

Nano-hydroxyapatite
(n-HA) has excellent biological activity, good
biocompatibility, and bone conductivity because its chemical composition
and crystal structure are similar to the inorganic component of the
natural bone. The addition of HA could enhance the mechanical properties
of scaffolds, which provide a template for a covering chondrocyte
suspension and render the scaffolds sufficient integration with the
host tissue to protected subchondral bone regeneration. Magnetic nanoparticles
(Fe2O3) can promote the proliferation and differentiation
of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Previous studies have integrated
Fe2O3 into a porous scaffold to create a magnetic
scaffold and found enhanced proliferation and adhesion of BMSCs in
vitro.5 It is reported that labeling BMSCs
with Fe2O3 causes cells to transfer from the
extracellular matrix to the sites of cartilage damage, which promotes
the differentiation of BMSCs into cartilages and stimulates chondrogenesis.6,7 Previous findings by Ngadiman et al.8,9 and Sheikh
et al.10 have shown the biocompatibilities
of Fe2O3/PVA and n-HA/PVA, and they are recommended
to execute a side-by-side study comparing the proliferation and the
differentiation of cells when they are seeded on PVA, Fe2O3/PVA, n-HA/PVA, and n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA.11,12

In this study, we prepared a magnetic
nanocomposite hydrogel using
PVA, n-HA, and Fe2O3. We found that the Fe2O3 regulated cell behavior within the scaffold
material and had good cell compatibility; thus, they were used to
construct tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Reagents and Instruments
The following
reagents and instruments were used in this study: PVA, n-HA, Fe2O3 (Shenzhen Xincheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd.),
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), trypsin,
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 500 U/mL penicillin and 500 μg/mL
streptomycin (Gibco USA), phosphate buffer solution (PBS), Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Keygen Tec), ultrasonic oscillator, weight meter, magnetic
stirrer (Central Laboratory of The Second People’s Hospital
of Shenzhen), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (Shenzhen Polytechnic),
mechanical tester CTM4000 (Research Institute of Tsinghua University
in Shenzhen), and electronic microscope (MIRA3 TESCAN, Research Institute
of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen).

2.2 Preparation
of Magnetic Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Figure 1 presents
the schematic illustration of the fabrication of n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA hybrid magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel. Briefly,
n-HA, Fe2O3, and PVA in a ratio of 1:0.5:10
were mixed and dissolved in deionized distilled water to produce Fe2O3. The n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite
hydrogel was successfully prepared using the ultrasonic dispersion
method and freeze-thawing cross-linking molding process. To create
PVA aqueous solutions, varying amounts of PVA were weighed and placed
in distilled water and heated and stirred at 90 °C for 1 h, to
fully dissolve the PVA. Varying quantities of n-HA particles and Fe2O3 were added into the PVA aqueous solution; after
ultrasonic treatment, the solution was stirred at 60 °C until
evenly mixed. Next, after 30 min of heat preservation, all the bubbles
in the solution were removed with a needle tube. The solution was
poured into a mold, and then the mold was placed in the freezer (−20
°C) overnight for 16 h. Next, the solution was removed and thawed
at room temperature for 4 h. Repeated freezing and thawing were performed
seven times to obtain the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite
hydrogel (Figure 2A).
The prepared n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel
was immersed in distilled water for one day to remove non-cross-linked
monomers. As a control, we also concurrently prepared a pure PVA hydrogel
(Figure 2B).

2.3 Water
Content and Crystallinity of the Magnetic
Nanocomposite Hydrogel
2.3.1 Determination of Water
Content of the Magnetic
Nanocomposite Hydrogel
The surface water of the magnetic
nanocomposite hydrogel was gently dried with a piece of filter paper
and placed into a dry beaker of known mass (m2). By weighing with a scale, the total mass of the hydrogel
with beaker was m3, and the mass of the
magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel was calculated as m1 = (m3 – m2). The magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel was placed in
a vacuum-drying oven and was dried at 60 °C for 36 h, until it
reached a constant weight. The mass of the dried magnetic nanocomposite
hydrogel was m0, and the water content
of the dried magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel was determined as W = (m1 – m0)/m1.

2.3.2 Test of Magnetic Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Crystallinity
The magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel was placed
in a vacuum-drying oven and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h until
a dried magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel was obtained. About 5 mg of
the dried magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel (precision: 0.01 mg) was
accurately weighed with a microbalance and placed in an aluminum crucible
with a hole in the cover and then was measured with a DSC. An empty
crucible of the same type was used as a control. High-purity nitrogen
(volume fraction: 0.99999) was used as a protective gas and a purge
gas, with a respective flow rate of 20 and 70 mL·min–1. The temperature of the DSC was elevated from 10 °C/min to
250 °C using the programmed temperature to obtain the melting
enthalpy of the dried magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel. This value
was then used to calculate the crystallinity of the dried magnetic
nanocomposite hydrogel.

2.4 Characterization
of Hydrolytic Degradation
The weight loss method was used
for the characterization of the
hydrogel degradation performance in PBS. In this experiment, the same
qualities of n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA hydrogel and pure
PVA hydrogel were suspended in a PBS (pH 7.5) incubator at 37 °C
for degradation experiments. At the selected time points (0, 2, 4,
6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 days), the qualities of the hydrogels
in each group were measured.

2.5 Mechanical Testing and
Microscopic Morphology
Analysis
2.5.1 Mechanical Testing
The elastic
modulus measurement of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite
hydrogel was characterized using an electronic universal testing machine
CTM4000 in the mechanical testing laboratory. The diameter, thickness,
and loading rate of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite
hydrogel were 5 mm, 3 mm, and 5.00 mm/min, respectively.

2.5.2 Microscopic Morphology Analysis
The n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel was frozen
and dried. Next, after metal spraying, scanning analysis of the surface
and cross section of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite
hydrogel were conducted. The microscopic morphology of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel was observed and analyzed
using a TESCAN (Czech Republic) field emission scanning electron microscope.
We acquired secondary electron images and backscattered electron images.

2.6 Cell Culture and Cell Compatibility Study
A New Zealand white rabbit (aged 3 months) was anesthetized and
then underwent skin disinfection and preparation. The rabbit’s
bone marrow was punctured at the left femur trochanter, and about
3 mL of bone marrow was extracted using a syringe containing 2 mL
heparin. The extracted bone marrow was placed into a 10 mL centrifuge
tube, and the PBS was added to reach 5 mL. The bone marrow solution
was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded.
The pellet was washed twice with PBS, followed by centrifugation at
1000 rpm. High-glucose DMEM culture solution (containing 10% FBS,
1% double-antibody penicillin/streptomycin) (5 mL) was added to the
precipitated cell suspension, and then the mixed solution was cultured
in a CO2 incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.
Three days after culture, fresh medium was added to the flasks. Cells
were digested with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin and 0.02% (w/v) ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (Hyclone, USA) and subcultured at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/cm2. The BMSCs of passage 3 were co-cultured
with the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel for
cell compatibility study, and the cell compatibility of the composite
material was observed (Figure 5A,B). For chondrogenic differentiation experiment, we used
serum-free chondrogenic medium, which consisted of DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose;
Biochrom), 1% Insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) supplement, 100 nM
dexamethasone, 0.17 mM l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, and 0.35 mM l-prolin (all from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA).

2.6.1 Cell Proliferation Assay
Cell proliferation
was measured using the CCK-8 method. This experiment analyzed three
groups: BMSCs co-cultured with n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA
composite hydrogel (group A), BMSCs co-cultured with pure PVA hydrogel
(group B), and BMSCs cultured alone (group C), with five repeat samples
in each group. Cells at the exponential phase were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 1 × 103 cells per well. On
the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth days of cell culture,
50 μL CCK-8 solution was added to each complex hole and then
incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Next, the solution in each complex
hole was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the amount of solution
in each well was equalized. Light absorption values (A value, 490 nm wavelength) were measured with a Thermo-plate microplate
reader (Rayto Life and Analytical Science Co., Ltd., Germany) and
were used to create a cell proliferation curve.

2.6.2 Stereoscopic Optical Microscopy
This experiment examined
two groups: BMSCs cultured with n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA
composite hydrogel (group A) and BMSCs cultured
with pure PVA hydrogel (group B). The culture plate was uncovered
after one week of culture and placed under a stereoptical microscope.
A 100× magnification was used to observe cell growth.

2.6.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy
This
experiment examined two groups: BMSCs cultured with n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel (group A) and BMSCs cultured
with pure PVA hydrogel (group B). After one week of culture, the hydrogels
in each group were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
fixative at 4 °C for 2 h, and then dehydrated progressively with
ethanol. After critical-point drying with CO2 and metal
spraying, the adhesion of cells on the scaffold was observed with
a scanning electron microscope.

2.7 Histological
and Immunohistochemical Analyses
to Detect the Collage Protein
For histology, the cell/scaffold
constructs were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 16 h, through a series
of gradient ethanol to dehydrate, embedded in paraffin wax, and cut
into 5 μm thick sections, and then the samples were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For immunofluorescent staining
to detect the collage II protein expression levels, the cell/scaffold
constructs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized
with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and then blocked with 3% bovine
serum albumin for 60 min. Subsequently, these constructs were incubated
with a collagen type II antibody (ab34712, 1:100, Abcam, Cambridge,
USA) and then were subsequently exposed to Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated
secondary antibody overnight. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) and are shown in blue. The constructs were cut into thick sections
and were visualized using laser-scanning confocal microscopy (ZEISS,
Germany).

2.8 RNA Extraction and Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction Analysis
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol and
reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using a DNA synthesis kit
(TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) of glyceraldehyde phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), collagen II, and aggrecan were performed using
the SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Real-time PCRs were
performed using a 7500 real-time PCR detection system (ABI, Foster
City, CA) at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation
at 95 °C for 10 s, extension at 60 °C for 15 s, and annealing
at 72 °C for 15 s. Gene expression levels were normalized to
the housekeeping gene GAPDH, and the relative gene expression was
calculated using the ΔΔCT method.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Water Content and Crystallinity of the Magnetic
Nanocomposite Hydrogel
3.1.1 Water Content of the
Magnetic Nanocomposite
Hydrogel
The water content of the novel magnetic nanocomposite
hydrogel we prepared was 82.6%, lower than the water content of the
pure PVA hydrogel (85.3%, Figure 3A). This phenomenon could be explained as follows:
PVA was closely linked with n-HA and Fe2O3,
producing stress shrinkage, causing molecules to become densely packed,
forcing water in the pores to be discharged, and decreasing the volume
of the magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel. Consequently, the hydroxyl
of water molecule-producing hydrogen bond left little space to accommodate
water molecules, which resulted in lower water content.

hydrogel. (C) Scanning electron microscopic image of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel (2000×). (D) Scanning
electron microscopic image of the pure PVA hydrogel (2000×).

3.1.2 Crystallinity
of the Magnetic Nanocomposite
Hydrogel
Scaffolds with high crystallinity can have a high
elastic modulus and elongation at break.13 Changes to the crystallinity of the dried magnetic nanocomposite
hydrogel could indirectly suggest that its structure has changed.
It was believed that a polymer’s crystallinity is proportional
to its melting heat when melted.

The melting heat can be measured
using DSC atlas. Figure 3B shows the DSC atlas of the dried n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel and the DSC atlas of the dried pure PVA hydrogel.
As shown in Figure 3B, the dried n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel
showed a sharp endothermic peak around 217 °C, corresponding
to its melting heat, and showed a wide endothermic peak at 231 °C,
corresponding to its decomposition. The dried pure PVA hydrogel showed
a sharp endothermic peak around 221 °C, corresponding to its
melting heat, and showed a wide endothermic peak at 236 °C, corresponding
to its decomposition. By comparing to previously reported values of
the melting heat of 100% crystallized PVA, the crystallinity of the
hydrogel samples was obtained using the following equation14  where f(DSC) is the crystallinity
of the hydrogel samples measured through differential thermal analysis,
ΔH is the melting heat enthalpy of the hydrogel
samples, and ΔH0 is the melting
heat enthalpy of the PVA hydrogel with 100% crystallinity, reported
to be 138.6 J/g.15Table 2 shows the melting heat enthalpies of the
dried n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel and
the dried pure PVA hydrogel and their crystallinities as calculated
using the formula above.

3.2 Microscopic Morphology Analysis
The
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that many pores of different
sizes were distributed on the surface of the magnetic nanocomposite
hydrogel and that magnetic particles and n-HA particles were uniformly
distributed in the magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel, forming rough
bumps on the surface. These pores and bumps were beneficial to the
adhesion and growth of cells on the surface of the magnetic nanocomposite
hydrogel. In contrast, relatively few pores were distributed on the
surface of the pure PVA hydrogel (Figure 3C,D).

3.3 Mechanical
Property and the Degradation Testing
The mechanical properties
of the hydrogel samples were detected
by a three-point bending resistance experiment. The results showed
that the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel had
better mechanical properties than the pure PVA hydrogel, including
greater tensile strength, greater bending strength, and a higher bending
modulus (as shown in Table 3). The in vitro degradation of magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel
at different time points has shown that the magnetic hydrogel formulations
have relatively intermediate and slow degradation rates (Figure 4).

nanocomposite hydrogel at different
time points. Magnetic hydrogel formulations show relatively intermediate
and slow degradation rates.

3.4.1 Identification of the
BMSCs
To
confirm the stem cell characterization for the next study, we used
multilineage differentiation potential of BMSCs. We successfully characterized
the differentiation capacities of rabbit (rb)-BMSCs into various lineages
like chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic cells (Figure 5C–E).

the cell was sectioned and stained with toluidine blue; the positive

Scale bar = 100 μm.

3.4.2 Cell Proliferation Assay
We measured
BMSC proliferation on the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite
hydrogel using the CCK-8 method (Figure 6). There was no significant difference in
cell proliferation between the BMSCs cultured with n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel and either of the control groups
(i.e. BMSCs cultured with pure PVA hydrogel or BMSC culture alone, p > 0.05).

Figure 6 CCK-8 solution absorption for the group BMSCs
cultured with composite
gel, group BMSCs cultured with pure PVA gel, and group BMSCs cultured
without hydrogel. There were no significant differences in cell proliferation.

3.4.3 Stereoscopic
Optical Microscopy
After one week of BMSC culture with different
forms of hydrogel,
we performed stereoscopic optical microscopy. When the BMSCs were
cultured with the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel
(group A), cells had a polygon shape, contacted each other through
projections, proliferated and differentiated well, and showed a regular
stacking growth with time. When the BMSCs were combined with the pure
PVA hydrogel, they had a polygon shape and proliferated well but we
observed relatively few cells. This result shows that the magnetic
nanocomposite hydrogel had better biocompatibility than pure PVA hydrogel
alone.

3.4.4 SEM
According to our SEM results,
when BMSCs were cultured with n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA
composite hydrogel (group A), a large number of spindle or polygonal
cells adhered to and aggregated in the pores on the gel surface. In
contrast, only a small number of cells adhered to the pores on the
surface of the pure PVA hydrogel (group B). This demonstrates that
the magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel had good biocompatibility with
the BMSCs (Figure 7A,B).

Figure 7 Hydrogel material was co-cultured with BMSCs for one week. (A)
A large number of spindle or polygonal cells adhered to and aggregated
in the pores on the surface of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel. (B) A small number of cells adhered to the
pores on the surface of the pure PVA hydrogel.

3.4.5 Photomicrographs of the Histological Findings
The BMSCs formed a capsule around the construct in the central
region of the cell/scaffold constructs (Figure 8A,B). By contrast, at the peripheral edge
of the cell/scaffold constructs, clumps of cells were found and some
cells were well-dispersed. Also the cells at the surface were larger
compared with those in the central region (Figure 8C,D).

Figure 8 Photomicrographs of the histological findings
in the central (A,B)
and surface regions (C,D) of the cell/scaffold constructs, in static
culture for 14 days (20× magnification).

The levels to enhance the immunofluorescent signal of the
chondrogenic
differentiation marker were obviously observed in the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel group (Figure 9).

cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue) (scale bar is 20 μm).

3.4.6 Chondrogenic
Differentiation Potential of
Hydrogel Material
BMSCs cultured with the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel exhibited significantly higher
SOX9, aggrecan, and type II collagen expression (Figure 10). This material significantly
enhances the expression of cartilage-specific gene markers such as
type II collagen, aggrecan, and SOX9 relative to pure PVA hydrogel
during the culture period, thereby inducing differentiation of BMSCs
into hyaline chondrogenic cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that
our magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel scaffold material promotes chondrogenic
differentiation. Thus, the magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel may be
a reliable scaffold for cartilage tissue engineering. In addition,
this study will advance the development of magnetic strategies in
tissue engineering to repair the damaged cartilage tissue.

Figure 10 n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA enhances messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression of chondrogenic markers of BMSCs. Relative levels of type
II collagen (COL2A1), aggrecan (AGG), and SOX9 mRNA were determined
by quantitative real-time PCR in relation to GAPDH. Data were presented
as means ± standard deviations. Statistical analyses were performed
using analysis of variance (Dunnett’s test); **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 vs ctrl (control; BMSCs
cultured in maintenance medium).

4 Discussion and Conclusion
At present, the biomaterials studied in cartilage tissue engineering
mainly include natural or synthetic polymers, injectable hydrogels,
or other scaffold materials. A clinically useful scaffold material
for cartilage tissue engineering will have good biocompatibility,
biodegradability, low cytotoxicity, and certain mechanical properties.16 The scaffold material acts as an exogenous cell
carrier, namely, it promotes the migration, adhesion, proliferation,
and differentiation of BMSCs, or provides structural support. In this
study, we describe a novel magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel prepared
using the repeated freeze–thaw approach. The aqueous solution
of the composite material formed physical cross-linking points in
the form of tiny crystalline regions via intermolecular H-bonds in
the process of repeated freezing and thawing, which then formed a
hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure with considerable
mechanical strength and ability to swell. No harmful chemicals were
added throughout the process, and the biocompatibility of the composite
material was not reduced. Our novel hydrogel also has high water content
and good elasticity and can be prepared quickly and easily.17

Water content is an important property
of hydrogels. In the hydrogel
system, water content has a direct effect on the viscoelasticity and
mechanical properties of the material. A hydrogel’s compressive
strength, tensile strength, and modulus increase with decreasing water
content. When the water content is 80%, the tensile strength is similar
to natural cartilage. When the water content is less than 80%, the
homogeneity of the hydrogel becomes problematic.18 The water content of the magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel
prepared in this study was 82.6%, slightly less than the water content
of the pure PVA hydrogel (85.3%, Figure 3). During hydrogel formation, the molecular
chains in the amorphous region unwrap and the lamellar structure in
the crystalline region begins to expand. This expansion is accompanied
by the turnover and sliding of molecular chains, a process that absorbs
the energy generated by the viscoelastic deformation. Therefore, high
crystallinity can be compatible with high elastic modulus and elongation
at break. Changes to the crystallinity of a hydrogel can indirectly
suggest that its structure has changed.19Table 2 shows that
the crystallinity of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite
hydrogel is lower than that of the pure PVA hydrogel, indicating that
adding n-HA and Fe2O3 reduced the entanglement
points of interchain and intrachain hydrogen bonds formed in the PVA
hydrogel. While crystallinity decreased, the structure of amorphous
region increased and the network structure of the PVA hydrogel became
loose, thus the network gap in unit volume increased, resulting in
lower crystallinity of the PVA hydrogel.20

Mechanical testing showed that the mechanical properties of
the
n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel were superior
to the pure PVA hydrogel. This may be caused by the addition of n-HA
and Fe2O3 to the PVA hydrogel, as n-HA enhanced
the mechanical properties of the composite hydrogel while promoting
the repair of subchondral bone. SEM showed that many pores of different
sizes were distributed on the surface of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel, forming rough bumps on the surface.
These structures were beneficial to the adhesion and growth of cells
on the surface of the composite hydrogel, and the pores may have improved
the transmission and metabolism of nutrients. When the third-generation
BMSCs were co-cultured with the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA
composite hydrogel, we found that the cells were polygon-shaped, contacted
each other through projections, and showed regular stacking growth
with time. Additionally, proliferation, survival, and differentiation
rates were high in BMSCs co-cultured with the composite hydrogel.
A large number of spindle or polygonal cells adhered to and aggregated
in the pores on the surface of the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel, showing that the n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel had good biocompatibility. Moreover,
the prepared n-HA/Fe2O3/PVA composite hydrogel
showed an improvement in the differentiation of the BMSCs.

Cartilage
tissue engineers have always aimed to develop novel scaffold
materials with adequate mechanical strength, high biocompatibility,
and hydrophilicity, which are easy to degrade and absorb. The scaffold
material we describe in this study not only had all of the above characteristics
but also had featured superparamagnetic nanoparticle Fe2O3, which can promote the proliferation and differentiation
of the BMSCs and closely bind to the cell surface.

In this experiment,
a novel magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel scaffold
material was prepared. This hydrogel had similar water content as
natural cartilage and low crystallinity. This scaffold material had
good mechanical properties, and SEM demonstrated that micropores on
the hydrogel surface were beneficial to the growth and proliferation
of cells. In addition, experiments where BMSCs were cultured with
the magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel scaffold material demonstrated
that the scaffold material had good cell compatibility and induced
BMSC differentiation into chondrocytes. Thus, this scaffold material
has the potential for a broad range of therapeutic applications and
can be considered as a promising material for cartilage tissue engineering.
