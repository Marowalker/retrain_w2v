Single crystals of oxygen-incorporated ZnS (i.e., ZnS(1–x)Ox series) are environment-friendly wide-band-gap semiconductors available
for light-emitting devices and solar cell use. The series of materials
has considerable potential for use in visible ultraviolet areas with
flexibility for palette emissions. In this study, we grow oxygen-incorporated
ZnS series crystals by chemical vapor transport method with iodine
(I2) as the transport agent. Three different oxygen-incorporated
crystals of undoped ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 are studied. Through structural studies,
ZnS doped with oxygen crystallizes in the main sphalerite phase and
a little wurtzite structure. The lattice constants of the major cubic
phase are determined to be a = 5.43 Å (ZnS),
5.41 Å (ZnS0.94O0.06), and 5.39 Å
(ZnS0.88O0.12). Three band-edge excitonic transitions
are simultaneously detected by thermoreflectance measurement for the
ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 series samples. The energy positions of the band-edge
transitions decrease as the oxygen content increases in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. Defect-state and surface-state emissions, including sulfur
vacancy, oxygen vacancy, zinc interstitial, and so forth, can emit
approximately full-color spectra from the near band edge of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals. With adjusting the oxygen content, the ZnS(1–x)Ox can be a series of color-palette luminescence matters that applied
for fluorescent display or light-emitting device.

Introduction
In recent years, semiconductor optoelectronic and
photovoltaic components have developed rapidly. People have growing
demand for energy-saved lighting. The solid-state brightness sources
have become next-generation illuminated and display light sources
in daily life everywhere. To achieve that, light-emitting diodes1 and phosphors2 have
attracted both science attention and commercial feasibility because
their potential wide-scale uses in, for example, architectural lighting,
decorative lighting, flashlight, backlighting, fluorescent lamp, field
emission display,3 plasma display panel,4 high-energy detector, and so forth. In addition,
the application of biological light-emission devices5 and medical sterilization lamp6 development have also been concerned recently. Groups II–IV
zinc sulfide (ZnS) is a direct semiconductor with band gap of ∼3.7
eV,7−11 which is larger than that of
ZnO (∼3.3 eV).12,13 ZnS has generally two polymorphic
phases, cubic (zinc-blende (ZB)) and hexagonal (wurtzite (W)), in
the crystals.14 Similar to zinc oxide,
ZnS can easily form structural defects, such as sulfur vacancies,
twins, stacking faults, and so forth, in the crystal for emitting
defect lights.15 For the manufacture of
II–VI solid-state lighting devices, defect emissions may play
an important role in visible radiation for the human eye. For example,
ZnO can emit green and red lights caused by oxygen vacancy and zinc
defect. Nevertheless, ZnO lacks blue and purple emissions to achieve
full-color lighting because its lower energy gap will result in longer-wavelength
defect emissions. To attain blue and purple emissions, it is necessary
to develop the series of ZnS(1–x)Ox-related mixed compounds for widening
and tuning band gap. However, such kinds of materials information
for the ZnS(1–x)Ox series are still very rare up to date. One
report claimed that the ZnS nanoparticles annealed over 400 °C
will show ZnO structure in X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement.22 Nevertheless, no further optical measurement
result was reported.

In this study, we employ chemical vapor
transport (CVT) method to grow ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals of undoped
ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 using iodine (I2) as the transport agent. X-ray
diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, and energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopic analyses were used to characterize the structural
phase and stoichiometry of the as-grown ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals.
The oxygen incorporated into ZnS will render the crystal mainly cubic
zinc-blende (sphalerite) phase and a little wurtzite structure. Lattice
constants of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals of cubic phase were determined.
The cubic lattice constant decreases with the increase in the oxygen
content of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. Raman scattering spectroscopy experiments
of the ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 crystals were performed at 300 and 4 K. The room-temperature
Raman spectra show mainly the first-order longitudinal optical (LO)
phonon near ∼351 cm–1 and the transverse
optical (TO) phonon at ∼272 cm–1 for all
of the as-grown undoped and oxygen-doped ZnS crystals. It is the evidence
that the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals are crystallized in the major zinc-blende
phase. In particular, the surface optical (SO) phonon for the wurtzite
phase16 was also detected in the Raman
spectra of the oxygen-incorporated ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12 crystals. They are crystallized
in major cubic and minor hexagonal mixed phases. With the temperature
down to 4 K, the intensities of the LO and TO peaks greatly enhanced
and peak energies also blue-shifted owing to the temperature effect
in the ZnS(1–x)Ox lattice. The transmittance absorption edge of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series was also investigated by transmission measurement. The band
edge is red-shifted from 3.69 eV (ZnS) and 3.65 eV (ZnS0.94O0.06) to 3.61 eV (ZnS0.88O0.12)
owing to the increase in the oxygen content of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. For more
accurate study of the band-edge transitions (excitons), thermoreflectance
(TR) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were implemented. All
of the band-edge and valence-band-splitting transitions EA, EB, and EC are clearly detected in the TR spectra of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals. The PL results obviously show free-exciton (Fx)
emission peak in each of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals at low temperature.
The occurrence of PL band-edge emission verified good crystalline
quality of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals. At
low temperatures, we can also observe strong visible defect lights
from green and blue to purple through the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals.
It provides the potential for the ZnS(1–x)Ox series of solids as a visible
color-palette material for use in future full-color display.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the morphology and size
of the as-grown bulk crystals of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series: (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.06, and (c) x =
0.12. The pure ZnS crystal in Figure 1a essentially displays transparent and thicker outline.
The ZnS0.94O0.06 crystal in Figure 1b shows a light yellowish rectangular
shape. The ZnS0.88O0.12 crystal of the highest
oxygen content shows a white crystal of hexagonal shape displayed
in Figure 1c. The light
yellow style of the transparent ZnS(1–x)Ox crystal indicates the existence
of visible defect centers consisted in the as-grown crystals, whereas
the hexagonal shape outline of the ZnS0.88O0.12 may be owing to the presence of wurtzite {0001} or zinc-blende {111}
plane to the crystal. The size of the crystals in Figure 1a–c is in the order
of several millimeters. To evaluate the stoichiometric content of
the oxygen-incorporated ZnS, EDX measurements were implemented. Figure 1d–f shows the
EDX spectral analysis of undoped ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12, respectively, and the corresponding
as-grown crystals are shown in Figure 1a–c. For pure ZnS crystal, the atomic ratio
of Zn to S is estimated to be 50.25:49.75 based on the EDX spectrum
in Figure 1d. The result
indicated that a little chalcogen deficiency existed in the as-grown
ZnS crystal. For the oxygen-incorporated samples, the atomic ratio
of Zn to S to O is 50.43:46.60:2.97, as shown in Figure 1e for the ZnS0.94O0.06 crystal (i.e., O/(O + S) ≈ 6%). As for ZnS0.88O0.12, the stoichiometric ratio of Zn to S to
O is 50.38:43.67:5.95 (i.e., O/(O + S) ≈ 12%), as shown in Figure 1f. The oxygen peak
(O) of the EDX spectrum in Figure 1f (i.e., ZnS0.88O0.12) also shows
higher intensity than that of ZnS0.94O0.06 in Figure 1e. Within standard
errors, the stoichiometric content of the oxygen-incorporated ZnS
is hence defined as ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12, as referring to Figure 1.

analysis of the corresponding ZnS(1–x)Ox crystals.

For structural analysis, the obtained
transmission electron microscopy data of the ZnS(1–x)Ox samples are processed
and converted using DigitalMicrograph software (version 3.7.4; Gatan
Inc.). Figure 2a,d,g
shows the SEAD pattern, fast Fourier transform (FFT), and HRTEM image
of undoped ZnS, Figure 2b,e,h are those of ZnS0.94O0.06, and Figure 2c,f,i are those of
ZnS0.88O0.12, respectively. The zone axis of
the electron beam was along the [222] direction. The SEAD pattern
of each sample clearly reveals hexagon-shape dotted spots as the planes
of (220), (202), (02̅2), (2̅2̅0), (02̅2̅),
and (2̅02̅) in Figure 2. The FFT result (converted from the HRTEM image of
each sample) also shows comparable dotted pattern to that of the corresponding
SEAD pattern. This result reveals good crystalline quality of the
as-grown ZnS(1–x)Ox series obtained by CVT. The result can also be evident
by very clear atomic site image displayed in the HRTEM results of Figure 2g–i. The cubic
lattice constant a of ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 can be estimated
from their corresponding HRTEM images (i.e., by atomic spacing) and
verified by their SEAD patterns (i.e., using the dotted distances).
The values are determined to be a = 5.43 Å for
ZnS, 5.41 Å for ZnS0.94O0.06, and 5.39
Å for ZnS0.88O0.12. With the increase in
oxygen content, the lattice constant decreases in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series.

Figure 3a shows the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) data, which are employed to identify the structure
and crystalline phase of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals. For pure ZnS, the
diffraction peaks can be indexed as (111), (200), (220), (311), (222),
(400), (331), (420), and (422) planes for zinc-blende (ZB) ZnS phase.
The XRD pattern of ZnS matched well with that of the JCPDS No. 772100
(marked as the top green line in Figure 3a) for a cubic ZnS with zinc-blende structure.20 In addition, the XRD results of ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12 indicated
that most of the crystal structures belong to ZB, whereas three additional
peaks of W(101) at ∼26.69°, W(002) at ∼28.38°,
and W(100) at ∼30.68° can be detected by the oxygen-contained
samples of ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12. The diffraction peaks are similar to those of the
wurtzite (W) phase compound as referred to JCPDS No. 751534.21,22 Shown in Figure 3b is the comparison of the ZB(111) peak positions for the three compounds
derived from Figure 3a. The diffraction angle of ZB(111) plane moves to higher value with
respect to the increase of the oxygen content in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. The (111)
peak positions are 2θ = 28.43° for ZnS, 28.54° for
ZnS0.94O0.06, and 28.63° for ZnS0.88O0.12. It means lattice shrinkage with replacing sulfur
atom with oxygen in the ZnS unit cell. The cubic lattice constant
can be calculated to be a ≈ 5.43 Å for
ZnS, 5.41 Å for ZnS0.94O0.06, and 5.39
Å for ZnS0.88O0.12, similar to those estimated
in previous HRTEM results. It should be noticed that the ZB(111) peak
of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series in Figure 3 has nearly the same angle as that of W(002) in the wurtzite
phase. In fact, the band structure and optical property of ZB{111}
and W{0001} were claimed to be the same atomic arrangement and similar
energy states in the II–VI compounds.23 The resemblance of material property between ZB{111} and W{0001}
planes is maybe the turning point for phase transition from zinc-blende
to wurtzite in growing the oxygen-incorporated ZnS.

pattern of ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 series crystals. The samples are prepared by grinding
small crystals from each composition into powder. The data of JCPDS
card No. 772100 for ZnS and the XRD pattern of as-grown ZnO are also
included for comparison. (b) Comparison of ZB(111) peak feature for
the as-grown ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 series samples. The wurtzite-related peak
(marked with W, around 27°) is also detected in the ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12 samples.

Figure 4a shows the experimental
Raman spectra of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals at 300 K. One ZnO bulk crystal
grown by CVT was also included in Figure 4a for comparison. For undoped ZnS, a lot
of peak modes have been detected at 300 K, which are all indexed to
the cubic phase of zinc-blende ZnS.20,24,25 The most prominent peak is the longitudinal optical
phonon mode (LO ∼ 349 cm–1) occurred at the
Γ center point of the phonon-band Brillouin zone.25 The other representative peak of ZnS is the
transverse optical (TO) phonon at ∼272 cm–1. In particular, we can also detect one surface optical (SO) phonon
at ∼332 cm–1 [denoted as SO(W)] for the two
oxygen-incorporated ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12 crystals. The SO(W) peak also matches
well with that of ZnO with a wurtzite structure in Figure 4a. With the oxygen content
increased, the LO, TO, and SO phonons shift to lower wavenumber, as
displayed in Figure 4b. The
reduction of vibration energy in the LO, TO, and SO modes is maybe
correlated with the structure evolution of the ZnS(1–x)Ox sample containing
higher amount of oxygen. The presence of the SO(W) peak also indicates
that the mixed phase of zinc-blende and wurtzite existed in the oxygen-incorporated
ZnS. To identify more clearly the structure and phase of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series, low-temperature Raman measurement at 4 K was also implemented. Figure 4c shows the Raman
spectra of undoped ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 at 4 K. Most of the Raman peaks are enhanced
and blue-shifted with respect to those detected at 300 K in Figure 4a. The vibration
energy of the Raman mode is increased owing to the shrinkage of lattice
and bond length in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series at low temperature. The enhancement
of peak intensity is due to the reduction of thermal broadening effect
to the Raman peak features. The inset in Figure 4c clearly shows that the vibration energies
of the LO, TO, and SO(W) modes are reduced with increasing oxygen
content in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. The values of Raman shift (LO, TO, and SO)
versus oxygen content for the three samples at 4 K are also depicted
in Figure 4d. The vibration
energy of Raman mode also shows decrease with increasing oxygen content
in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. For the phase change of the ZnS(1–x)Ox crystal, we can also
observe that the intensities of the TO and LO modes in the cubic ZnS
(see inset in Figure 4c) decrease with increasing oxygen content. The LO and TO phonon
peaks of the zinc sulfide will even completely disappear when the
crystals are fully converted into zinc oxide,26 as shown in the lower part of the spectra in Figure 4a at 300 K. However, the appearance of the
SO(W) peak in the ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12 crystals also implies that a little wurtzite ZnO
is also incorporated into the formation of the ZnS(1–x)Ox ternary compounds.

To determine the band gap of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series, optical transmission
measurement has been implemented. It is a simple way to observe direct
band edge of the mixed compounds. Figure 5 shows the transmittance spectra of ZnS0.88O0.12, ZnS0.94O0.06, and
pure ZnS. The dashed lines are the experimental data at low temperature
(40 K), and the solid curves are those measured at room temperature.
The energy value of the bottom edge in each transmittance spectrum
is 3.69 eV for ZnS, 3.65 eV for ZnS0.94O0.06, and 3.61 eV for ZnS0.88O0.12 at 300 K. They
are increased (blue-shifted) to 3.81 eV (ZnS), 3.76 eV (ZnS0.94O0.06), and 3.72 eV (ZnS0.88O0.12) at 40 K following a general semiconductor trend. The smooth variation
of energy values in the bottom edge of the transmittance spectra (at
40 and 300 K) indicates the formation of ternary ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12 compounds
when the crystals were grown. This situation is similar to the gradual
lattice-constant change measured by XRD and HRTEM in the cubic ZnS(1–x)Ox series of different oxygen contents.

observation of absorption-edge shift vs oxygen content vs temperature
change.

To evaluate band-edge
structure and excitonic transitions of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals,
TR measurements were carried out. Figure 6a,b shows the experimental TR spectra of
ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 at 300 and 40 K, respectively, near band edge. The experiments
were done in the energy range of 3–4.3 eV in vacuum. TR has
been proven to be a very powerful tool for the determination of direct
interband transitions in semiconductor using a derivative line-shape
spectral feature.13,19 The derivative line shape of
TR feature suppresses unintentional spectral background and emphasizes
the energy location at exact interband transition. As shown in Figure 6, the dashed lines
are the experimental data and solid curves are the first-derivative
Lorentzian line-shape fits obtained using an equation appropriate
for band-edge excitonic transition expressed as27 1  where i is the respective transition, Aiex and ϕiex are the amplitude and phase, respectively,
and Eiex and Γiex are the energy and
broadening parameters of the interband excitonic transition, respectively. The
best fit by using eq 1 can be shown by the solid line on each of the TR spectra because
the band-edge transition energies of the cubic {111} plane are similar
to those of the wurtzite {0001} face to show three features of EA, EB, and EC excitons. The result is caused by crystal-field
and spin–orbital coupling in the valence band of the II–VI
compounds.13,28 As shown in Figure 6a, the obtained transition energies of the
A, B, and C excitons of the {111}-plane ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 crystals are determined
to be EA = 3.776, 3.751, and 3.712 eV; EB = 3.832, 3.796, and 3.771 eV; and EC = 3.917, 3.878, and 3.843 eV, respectively,
at 300 K. The transition energies of ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 at 40 K are, respectively, EA = 3.864, 3.807, and 3.786 eV; EB = 3.918, 3.856, and 3.824 eV; and EC = 3.998, 3.943, and 3.896 eV. The energy variations
of the EA, EB, and EC excitons in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series are shown
by dotted arrows in Figure 6. Essentially, the transition energies increase with decreasing
oxygen content of ZnS(1–x)Ox.

spectra of ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 series crystals for the determination of band-edge
excitonic transitions at (a) 300 K and (b) 40 K. Three band-edge transitions
denoted as EA, EB, and EC transitions are detected
by the crystals, and their energy-variation traces are depicted as
dotted arrows for comparison.

The PL experiment is an effective
tool for the evaluation of band-edge and defect emissions in a luminescent
material. For ZnS(1–x)Ox-related compounds, it is known that the appearance
of band-edge emission is a high-quality index for the ZnS crystalline
state. In combination with both TR and PL techniques, we can determine
the energy positions of band-edge transition EA and free-exciton Fx emission. Figure 7a shows, from top to bottom, the TR and PL
spectra of ZnS0.88O0.12, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS at 40 K. The PL band-edge emissions of ZnS0.88O0.12 include Fx and bound exciton complexes
(BECs) at 3.7–3.8 eV. The BECs may contain biexciton XX (surface
exciton SX), neutral-donor-bound exciton D0X, and neutral-acceptor-bound exciton A0X that
had ever been detected by previously pure ZnS.20 For the free-exciton emission Fx, the peak values are 3.784
eV for ZnS0.88O0.12, 3.787 eV for ZnS0.94O0.06, and 3.796 eV29 for ZnS.
The appearance of Fx emission indicates high crystalline quality of
the as-grown ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals. For each of the ZnS(1–x)Ox compounds in Figure 7a, the energy positions
of band-edge transition EA (in TR) and
free exciton Fx (in PL) are similar, whereas the energies of EB and EC are larger
than EA. The EB and EC transitions are originated from
valence-band splitting as indicated in the representative band-edge
scheme in Figure 7c.
The energy values of EA, EB, and EC obtained by TR using
the spectral analysis of eq 1 are shown in Figure 7b. The emission energies of Fx of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series obtained by
PL are also included for comparison. In general, the band-edge transition
energy of EA in the wurtzite {0001} plane
is higher than that in the cubic (zinc-blende) {100} plane due to
the larger crystal-field and spin–orbital coupling.30 Because of the similarity of atomic arrangement
in ZB{111} and W{0001}, the transition energy EA of ZB{111} is similar to that of W{0001} but higher than
that of ZB{100}. That
is why, the ZB–ZnS simultaneously having the mixed {111} and
{100} planes will widen (broaden) the EA feature of TR, as shown in Figure 7a. The HRTEM image of ZnS shown in the inset of Figure 7a clearly demonstrates
that the ZnS has the {111} and {100} mixed planes (i.e., existence
of stacking fault).30 For ZnS, the PL emission
of Fx is coming from the lowest-energy states’ recombination
(i.e., from {100} plane), whereas the TR optical transition EA may originate from the higher-energy states’
absorption (i.e., from the {111} plane). The energy separation of EA – Fx in ZnS is therefore larger than
that in ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12, as shown in Figure 7b. For the highest oxygen-contained sample ZnS0.88O0.12, the wurtzite-phase composition is the
largest in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. The energies of EA and Fx are nearly the same as shown in Figure 7b. The TR and PL spectra of ZnS0.88O0.12 in Figure 7a even show additional spectral features from wurtzite ZnO
at ∼3.4 eV. Figure 7d shows the energy separations of EB – EA (EAB) and EC – EB (EBC) of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series caused by
valence-band splitting from crystal-field and spin–orbital
coupling.31 The results are obtained by
TR measurements. For ZnS, the values of EAB and EBC are 54 and 80 meV in Figure 7d. With increased
oxygen content, the energy separations of EAB and EBC are gradually reduced in the
ZnS(1–x)Ox series. The reduction is maybe owing to the decrease of crystal
field in the crystal environment of the oxygen-incorporated ZnS.

Figure 7 (a) TR and PL spectra
of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals
at 40 K. The energy positions of EA and
Fx are indicated with arrows. The HRTEM image of ZB–ZnS in
the inset shows that the ZnS simultaneously consisted of ZB{111} and
ZB{100} planes caused by stacking fault. (b) Excitonic transition
energies (EA, EB, and EC) vs sulfur content in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. (c) Schematic diagram of band-edge structure for ZB{111}
or wurtzite {0001} in the ZnS(1–x)Ox series. (d) Energy separations of EC – EB and EB – EA vs

The as-grown ZnS(1–x)Ox series compounds have a band gap larger than that
of ZnO (see the PL and TR result of ZnS0.88O0.12 in Figure 7a). It
is reasonable that the defect emissions of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series can have a
higher energy value than ZnO. It can be expected that the ZnS(1–x)Ox compound emits blue defect light for overcoming the drawback of
ZnO defect emission (i.e., energy lower than green emission). Figure 8 shows, from left
to right, the PL spectra and emission colors (image) of the ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 samples at low temperature for further demonstrating color-palette
light-emission capability. It is noticed that the color emissions
can also be observed at room temperature, but they are weakened owing
to thermal effect. We have therefore taken color images at low temperature
due to the stronger PL intensity. As shown in the upper part of Figure 8, all of the full-PL
spectra emit not only the defect emission but also the band-edge emission
to show high crystalline quality of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals.
For ZnS, strong purple light is emitted. A violet luminescence peak
appeared at 375 nm (3.31 eV), which is an electronic transition from
conduction band to the Zn interstitial defect (VZn, responsible for an acceptor level),32 as shown in the inset in Figure 8, for ZnS. A strong blue light can be emitted
from the ZnS0.94O0.06 sample, as displayed in
the middle-part image of Figure 8. Radiative recombination of electrons from sulfur
vacancy (VS) to holes in valence band
leads to evolution of blue-component PL peak that positioned at around
430 nm (2.88 eV).5 For green-light emission
of the ZnS0.88O0.12 sample (see right-part image),
an emission band around 500 nm (2.48 eV) is arisen when the photogenerated
holes were trapped in the deep level by oxygen vacancy (VO).33 The electron–hole
recombination will occur when an electron in a shallow level below
conduction band recombines with a hole in the VO level.34 The higher-energy colorful
emissions of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series of green, blue, and purple together
with the intrinsic green, orange, and red defect emissions in ZnO
will render a full-color light emission from ∼380 to ∼620
nm. The ZnS(1–x)Ox series compounds may hence derive the advantage for application
in visible-light fluorescent material, light-emitting device, or display
component.

spectra and the corresponding
visible-light images of ZnS(1–x)Ox caused by defect and band-edge emissions
at 10 K. The sample emission lights clearly show purple, blue, and
green colors that are available for future color-palette emission
device’s fabrication.

Conclusions
High-quality
oxygen-incorporated ZnS(1–x)Ox with different oxygen contents of x = 0, 0.06, and 0.12 have been synthesized and grown by
CVT method. The EDX measurement verified stoichiometric content of
the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals. The analyses of XRD, HRTEM, SAED, FFT, and
Raman measurements reveal that the as-grown ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals possess
high crystalline quality and that a main zinc-blende phase was present
in the pure ZnS, whereas the mixed phase of major zinc-blende and
minor wurtzite existed in the oxygen-incorporated ZnS0.94O0.06 and ZnS0.88O0.12 samples.
The cubic lattice constants were determined to be a = 5.43 Å (ZnS), 5.41 Å (ZnS0.94O0.06), and 5.39 Å (ZnS0.88O0.12). With increasing
the oxygen content, the lattice constant was decreased in the crystal
series. Optical measurements of transmission, TR, and PL are carried
out to characterize the band-edge structure and defect emissions of
the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals. The appearance of band-edge excitonic emissions
in the ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 samples reflects high quality of the crystals. Owing
to the similarities in the atomic arrangement and optical properties
of ZB{111} and W{0001} planes, the EA, EB, and EC excitonic
transitions caused by crystal-field and spin–orbital coupling
can be simultaneously detected by the ZnS, ZnS0.94O0.06, and ZnS0.88O0.12 samples using
TR experiment. The energy of EA is close
to that of free-exciton emission Fx detected by PL. Because of the
coexistence of ZB{111} and ZB{100} planes in the ZnS by stacking fault,
the energy of free-exciton emission Fx by PL (dominated by lower-energy
{100} plane) is lower than that of EA by
TR (dominated by higher-energy {111} plane). The energies of Fx and EA are comparable for the wurtzite ZnS0.88O0.12 of highest oxygen content. The energy separations
of valence-band splitting between EA, EB, and EC transitions
show decrease with increasing oxygen content owing to the reduction
of crystal field. At low temperature, strong blue light by sulfur
vacancy to valence band (∼430 nm) in ZnS0.94O0.06 and enhanced purple light by conduction band to the Zn
interstitial (∼375 nm) in ZnS are emitted from the samples.
The blue-violet defect emission of ZnS(1–x)Ox will amend ZnO that lacks higher-energy
visible-light defects. The ZnS(1–x)Ox series of crystals is highly desirable
for use in a light-emitting or display assembly of a color-palette-emitting
device.

Experimental Section
Crystal Growth and Structural Characterization
Single crystals of ZnS(1–x)Ox series with various oxygen content of x = 0, 0.06, and 0.12 were grown by CVT method17 using I2 as the transport agent.
Such kind of CVT growth was performed in a horizontal three-zone tube
furnace with a temperature gradient setting as 950 °C ←
1000 °C → 950 °C18 for
simultaneously growing two sealed quartz ampoules (22 mm o.d., 17
mm i.d., 20 cm length).19 The temperature
gradient was about −2.5 °C/cm to the quartz ampoules.
Prior to the crystal growth, pure elements of Zn (99.99% pure) and
S (99.999% pure), ZnO powder (99.999% pure), and a small amount of
transport agent (I2, ∼10 mg/cm3) were
put into the quartz ampoule, which was then cooled with liquid nitrogen,
evacuated to ∼10–6 Torr, and sealed. The
ratio and weights of Zn, S, and oxygen must be measured in proper
stoichiometric composition. For growing 10 g of ZnS0.94O0.06, the weights of the starting elements must be Zn
= 6.776 g, S = 3.123 g, and ZnO > 0.056 g to achieve the stoichiometry
of ZnS0.94O0.06. The growth kinetics of the
CVT with the auxiliary of transport agent can be described as i·A(s) + j·B(g) ⇆ k·C(g), where A is the
synthesized material, B is the transport agent, and C is the gaseous
synthesized compound (A, C = ZnS(1–x)Ox and B = I2). The formation
of ZnS must undertake the reversed reaction of the above equation,
and keeps 480 h for growing large single crystals. For X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements, Cu Kα line (λ = 1.5418 Å) was
the X-ray light source and a silicon standard used for experimental
calibration. The structures and stoichiometry of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystals were
characterized by HRTEM, XRD, and EDX techniques.

Optical Measurements
Optical transmission
and TR measurements were carried out from 3 to 4.2 eV. A 150 W xenon-arc
lamp acted as the white-light source. The white light was dispersed
and filtered by a photon technology international 0.2-m monochromator
to provide the monochromatic light. A 1200 groves/mm ruled grating
acted as the dispersion unit. The transmission or reflected light
from the sample (∼80 μm in thickness) was detected by
a photomultiplier tube and signal was recorded via an EG&G model
7265 dual-phase lock-in amplifier. The μ-Raman measurements
of the ZnS(1–x)Ox series crystal were carried out using a RAMaker integrated
micro-Raman-PL identified system (Protrusttech Co. Ltd., Taiwan) equipped
with one 532 nm solid-state diode-pumped laser as the excitation source.
A light-guiding microscope was equipped with an Olympus objective
lens (50×, working distance ∼ 8 mm) for interconnection
and coupling the ZnS(1–x)Ox sample, incident light, scattered light,
and the charge-coupled device (CCD) spectrometer. A Janis liquid-helium
open-cycle cryostat with thermometer controller assists low-temperature
measurement of the oxygen-incorporated ZnS crystals. The PL measurements
were implemented in a spectral measurement system, where a TRIAX 550
imaging spectrometer equipped with a 1200 groves/mm grating acted
as the dispersion unit. The CCD array detection was employed in the
PL measurement. The pumping light source was a Q-switched diode-pumped
solid-state laser of λ = 266 nm, and the spot size reduced to
∼100 μm. A set of neutral-density filters changed and
controlled the pumping power of the laser. For the low-temperature
and temperature-dependent PL measurements, a He-compressed RMC 22
closed-cycle refrigerator equipped with a thermometer controller facilitated
the experiments.20 For the observation
and record of the color-emission images of the ZnS(1–x)Ox samples, the temperature
was kept low for getting strong defect emissions from the crystals.
The color-emission images were recorded by a digital camera during
the low-temperature measurement of PL spectra with a 266 nm laser
excitation.
