The famous solvatochromic Reichardt’s dye was
applied to
quantify hydrostatic pressure in media. The UV/vis spectra of the
dye in various organic solvents are shifted bathochromically or hypsochromically
at the shorter- or longer-wavelength band, respectively, upon hydrostatic
pressurization. The ET value, determined
by an absorption maximum, in ethyl acetate increases from 38.5 kcal
mol–1 at 0.1 MPa to 39.2 kcal mol–1 at 300 MPa, which is mostly equal to the one in chloroform at 0.1
MPa. These spectroscopic origins were supported by the time-dependent
density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The concept and approach
proposed in this paper, i.e., a dual indicator, should attract the
attention of a broad spectrum in multidisciplinary science.

1 Introduction
Chemical indicators are
a type of sensor that outputs a spectral,
optical, or electrochemical signal in response to a chemical input
to be quantitatively determined.1 For instance,
a pH indicator is a well-known example used to colorimetrically analyze
pH in solution, where proton concentration and UV/vis spectral changes
are the input and output information, respectively.2 Such chemical indicators serve as versatile chemosensors
for sensing, probing, and imaging a wide range of analytes such as
chemicals,3 volatile organic compounds
(VOC),4 explosives,5 chiralities,6 biomolecules,7 and apoptosis for cancer treatments.8 Among the many dyes/chromophores/luminophores
reported so far,3−8 a colorimetric indicator that can measure media conditions (e.g.,
polarity, viscosity, and polarizability) is critical for basic science
as this makes it possible to more easily elucidate details about solvent–solute
interactions. These weak interactions, i.e., solvation, are inherently
considered to be one of the entropy-related factors controlling not
only supramolecular complexation equilibria in the ground state,9 on the basis of eq 1, but also photoreaction rates in the excited state.10 1   2  Here K represents an equilibrium
constant, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, P is the pressure, ΔH° is the standard enthalpy, ΔS° is the standard entropy, ΔF° is
the Helmholtz energy, and ΔV° is the change
of volume.

According to eq 2 derived
from the common thermodynamic parameters, the pressure term turns
out to be a fundamental controllable factor.10b,11 Indeed, the effect of hydrostatic pressure on molecular recognition
in solutions have long been investigated,12 and greatly affect volume changes upon complexation. These facts
indicate that simultaneously measuring pressure as well as polarity
in reaction medium can lead to a deeper mechanistic understanding
of the origins controlling chemical reactions. Although various pressure-responsive
luminophores in solutions have been developed over the years,13 a dual chemometric indicator that is susceptible
to mutually related polarity and pressure is quite rare.

Reichardt’s
dye (1), shown in Figure 1, has long been known as a
useful solvatochromic reagent, and generally, an empirical ET value estimated from an absorption maximum
in a solvent is now widely employed.14 This
prompted us to develop a novel dual indicator that exhibits drastic
UV/vis spectral changes in response to hydrostatic pressure stimuli
as well as solvent polarity.

(1) and
definitions of the angles τi.

In the present study, to expand the range of 1 from
the original to the dual indicator, we investigated the hydrostatic
pressure effects on compound 1 in common organic solvents
with its spectral variation upon hydrostatic pressurization and also
examined the origins of the spectral changes by means of quantum mechanical
calculations. The results will be discussed to elucidate the factors
governing the hydrostatic pressure outcomes of 1.

2 Results and Discussion
The hydrostatic
pressure effects on the absorption properties of
dilute solutions of compound 1 were first examined in
ethyl acetate, chloroform, dichloromethane, acetone, acetonitrile,
2-propanol, ethanol, and methanol as representative eight organic
solvents (ET; 38.1–55.4 kcal mol–1) using UV/vis spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 2, a broad intramolecular
charge-transfer (CT) band15 (A) with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 3522 cm–1 around 500–900 nm and two absorption maxima with FWHM of
3268 cm–1 at ca. 400 nm (B, see below
for the assignment) and of 7627 cm–1 at ca. 300
nm (C; see below for the assignment) were observed in
ethyl acetate under an ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) at room temperature.
According to the ET definition,14 the ET value in
ethyl acetate at 0.1 MPa was determined to be 38.5 kcal mol–1 estimated from the absorption maximum of the A band,
which is in good agreement with the literature value of 38.1 kcal
mol–1.

Figure 2 UV/vis spectra of compound 1 in
ethyl acetate (158
μM) at 0.1, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220,
240, 260, 280, and 300 MPa, measured in a high-pressure cell at room
temperature.

Gradual increase of the applied pressure from 0.1
to 300 MPa causes
a monotonic hyperchromic effect at the whole spectral range studied
since effective concentrations are elevated upon pressurization. The
FWHM values of the three bands do not change throughout the applied
hydrostatic pressure. On the other hand, the three absorption maxima
behave very differently: the A band showed a steady hypsochromic
shift from 742 nm at 0.1 MPa to 731 nm at 300 MPa with increasing
hydrostatic pressure in sharp contrast to a slight bathochromic shift
from 302 nm at 0.1 MPa to 306 nm at 300 MPa for the C band, whereas there are almost no changes for the B band. Similar pressure-induced shifts of the three bands were also
observed in other solvents (see Figures S1–S7 in the Supporting Information (SI)).

As can be seen from Figure 3, the gradual shifts
in the absorption bands A and C show both
good linear relationships against the
pressure applied, affording slopes (α) of αA = 0.80 cm–1 MPa–1 for the A band and of αC = −1.40 cm–1 MPa–1 for the C band, respectively.
These slopes observed in other solvents are summarized in Table 1. Indicator 1 is spectroscopically susceptible to hydrostatic pressure
stimuli, as expected. The apparent ET value
at 300 MPa in ethyl acetate is 39.2 kcal mol–1,
which is mostly equal to the one in chloroform at 0.1 MPa, and eventually,
the value in methanol at 300 MPa reached 56.1 kcal mol–1, which is comparable to glycol (ET;
56.3 kcal mol–1) as a more polar solvent. From the
dual indicator point of view, the two sensitive bands can mutually
be used as a reference; the slopes at the A band in dichloromethane
and 2-propanol are quite similar but those at the C band
differ remarkably.

The absorption spectrum has been simulated using TD-DFT(LRC-ωPBEh),
including the lowest 200 singlet states. The theoretical spectrum
is shifted by δλ = 134 nm to guide the eye and is shown
in Figure 4 (blue line).
Three CT bands are observed at 572, 688, and 930 nm. These three bands
form the experimentally observed large A band around
800 nm. Both the shorter wavelength bands B and C are also reproduced at 301 and 392 nm and are attributed
to a mix of local excitations (LE) and CT, and CT transitions, respectively.

Figure 4 Theoretical
absorption spectra. In blue: absorption at the ground-state
minimum geometry. In red: averaged absorption over 30 snapshot geometries
taken from the AIMD propagation in the ground state. A bathochromic
shift of δλ = 134 nm has been applied to the whole spectrum
to align it on the experimental one. A broadening of Δ = 10
nm has been used.

The peak calculated at 484 nm corresponds to the
shoulder observed
around 450 nm experimentally. The nature of the different peaks are
illustrated by the difference of density associated to the transition
from the ground state to the excited states with the largest oscillator
strength; see Figures 5 and S8 (SI). All absorbing states are
mainly of CT character, with a small mixing with local excitation
(LE) occurring for the state lying within the absorption band around
300 nm. The average absorption spectrum calculated using 30 snapshots
taken from an AIMD trajectory is shown in Figure 4 (red line). The motions in the ground state
lead to a shift and a broadening of the CT band found at 930 nm. It
spans from around 550–900 nm and is in good agreement with
the experimentally observed band. Both peaks, at 484 and 392 nm, are
shifted by 16 nm toward longer wavelengths (to 500 and 408 nm, respectively).
The intense peak at 300 nm and the shoulder around 250 nm are qualitatively
not affected by the ground-state molecular motions.

Figure 5 Difference of electronic
densities between the states composing
the main studied absorption bands and the ground state. When said
band is comprised of several states, only one representative transition
is shown. See Figure SI for a description
of additional states. Red: loss of electronic density, blue: gain.
The numbering of the state and its transition wavelength are shown
below.

The geometry of the minimum of energy in the ground
state of 1 corresponds to a quasi C2 symmetry,
with the
C2 axis along the ON bond. The values of τi, defined in Figure 1, at this geometry are reported in Table 2. τ1 (31.1°) and τ2 (−49.9°) are rotations
of part of the system around the C2 axis and therefore
do not break the symmetry. The four other angles can be put into two
groups: τ11 and τ12 (−53.2
and −51.0, respectively) and τ21 and τ22 (35.2 and 35.9, respectively).

a All values are reported in degrees.

The planarity of the molecule over the ground-state
dynamics is
investigated by looking at the τ angles along the AIMD trajectory.
The distribution of the τ angles is shown in Figure 6 and the average value ⟨τi⟩ and the variance σi are reported in Table 2. Two different quasi normal distributions
can be observed at ∼−47 and ∼27° corresponding
to two minima. Angles τ11, τ12,
and τ2 are rotations around neighboring C–C
bonds. Because of the proximity of bulky groups (see Figure 1), the angles are constrained
to larger values to minimize steric hindrance. τ1, τ21, and τ22 are the rotations
of groups located at either end of the molecule. There, the steric
hindrance is much smaller and the phenyl groups can adopt a conformation
closer to planarity. With a variance of σ1 = 20.3°,
τ1 is the most flexible angle. All the other five
angles have significantly smaller variance (of about 7°) as they
are constrained by steric hindrance. The two ending phenyl groups
charactered by τ21 and τ22 have
a slightly larger variance due to their position. These overall small
variances stress out the spatial congestion and a planar conformation
is unlikely even under the high-pressure conditions. This fact indicates
that the spectral changes of the indicator 1 by pressurizing
are highly likely not to originate from structural changes of the
phenyl groups but rather from inherent changes of the solvent’s
physical properties, i.e., refractive index and thus polarizability
under high pressure.16 The fact that the
FWHM of the three experimentally observed bands do not change with
the pressure points to the same conclusion as a change of the different
τ angles would lead to a relative shift of the absorption energy
of the electronic states depending on their nature.

Figure 6 Distribution of the angles
(a) τ1, τ2, (b) τ11, τ21, and (c)
τ12 and τ22 along the AIMD propagated
in the ground state. When the distribution follows a normal law g(τi), this one is shown in black lines, where . ⟨τi⟩ and σi are reported in Table 2.

The response of the energy of an electronic state
to a change of
polarity of its environment depends on the nature of the said state
and on its dipole moment in particular. The absorption energy of a
transition therefore depends on the difference of the dipole moment
of the excited state  and of the ground state . The electronic ground state has a dipole
moment of  along the  direction. At equilibrium, the solvent
accommodates this dipole and an increase of polarity of the environment
will further stabilize the ground state.

The first excited state
S1, composing the band A, is a charge transfer
from the “bottom” to
the “top” of the molecule, i.e., in the same direction
of . This CT induces a flip of the dipole moment
in the excited state:  along the  direction. The capacity of the solvent
to reorganize to accommodate this large dipole moment change is hindered
by the increase of pressure. This leads to an increase of the absorption
energy and therefore to the hypsochromic shift of the A band observed experimentally.

The main electronic states composing
the absorption band C have a dipole moment in the same
direction as  but of lower intensity. The interaction
of these states with the solvent is therefore weaker than the ground
state interaction with the environment. Increasing the pressure brings
the solvent molecule out of their equilibrium geometry and the ground
state is therefore destabilized. This destabilization is not as large
for the electronic excited states composing the C absorption
band as their dipole moment, and therefore, their interaction with
the solvent is smaller. This results in a decrease of the energy gap
between the ground state and the states composing the C absorption band and therefore to a bathochromic shift of the C band.

Therefore, the contrasting pressure-induced
wavelength shifts of
the A and the C bands can be attributed
to the relative stabilization of ground or excited states, respectively,
as were the cases with those observed in aromatic compounds accompanied
by red shifts (related to 1LE transitions) upon hydrostatic
pressurization.13m,17

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
demonstrated the spectral controls of Reichardt’s
dye induced by hydrostatic pressure, enabling it to be used as a colorimetric
polarity/pressure dual indicator. The pressure-induced spectral changes
are very contrasted at the A and C bands,
the origins of which were supported by the TD-DFT calculations. It
can be therefore emphasized that the present approach thus observed
by using Reichardt’s dye may be expandable to other chromophores
and/or fluorophores for developing further dual indicators.

4 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
4.1 General
UV/vis spectra were recorded
on JASCO V-560. Spectrophotometric grade solvents and Reichardt’s
dye were used without further purification.

4.2 Computational Details
All calculations
were performed with the long range corrected LRC-ωPBEh functional18a and the 6-31G* Pople basis set18b,18c within the Qchem 5.0
package.18d The range separation parameter
ω = 0.148a0–1 was
determined using the optimal tuning procedure that have proven efficient
for organic molecule exhibiting low lying charge transfer states.18e,18f The ground state minimum geometry has been optimized with DFT and
a frequency analysis has been performed to ensure there were no imaginary
frequencies. The electronic structure was computed with Time Dependent
DFT (TD-DFT) within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation.18g The absorption spectrum was both determined by TD-DFT calculations
including the lowest 200 singlet states and by averaging the absorption
spectra of 30 different structures taken randomly along an ab initio
molecular dynamics simulation performed with TeraChem18h with the 3-21G* basis set18i,18j and the PBE functional,18k,18l including the DFT-D3
Grimme dispersion correction.18m The oscillator
strength of each transition (fn) of energy
ωn was broadened with a Gaussian
function  where Δ is the full-width at half maximum
set to 10 nm.

4.3 General Procedure for Measurements under Hydrostatic
Pressure
UV/vis spectroscopic experiments under high pressure
were performed by using the high-pressure apparatus reported previously.19 A solution of a given concentration of compound 1 was introduced to a quartz cell for high pressure (3 mm
width, 2 mm depth, and 7 mm height). The quartz cell was connected
to a Teflon tube for adjusting the applied pressure, sealed by a metal
stopper, and then placed in the high pressure apparatus. The sample
solution thus put into the apparatus was measured by UV/vis spectroscopy
upon hydrostatically pressurization from 0.1 to 300 MPa.
