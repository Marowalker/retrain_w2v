Silicon nanowire field-effect transistors
(SiNW-FETs) have been
demonstrated as a highly sensitive platform for label-free detection
of a variety of biological and chemical entities. However, detecting
signal from immunoassays by nano-FETs is severely hindered by the
distribution of different charged groups of targeted entities, their
binding orientation, and distances to the surface of the FET. Aptamers
have been widely applied as a recognition element for plentiful biosensors
because of small molecular sizes and moderate to high specific binding
affinity with different types of molecules. In this study, we propose
an effective approach to enhance the electrical responses of both
direct (6×-histidine) and sandwich (amyloid β 1–42)
immunoassays in SiNW-FETs with R18, a highly negative charged RNA
aptamer against rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG). Empirical results presented
that the immunosensors targeted with R18 expressed a significantly
stabilized and amplified signal compared to the ones without this
aptamer. The research outcome provides applicability of the highly
negative charged aptamer as a bioamplifier for immunoassays by FETs.

1 Introduction
Since being invented by
Lieber’s group in 2001,1 silicon
nanowire field-effect transistor (SiNW-FET)
sensors have received particular interests because of their high sensitivity
for label-free and real-time detection.1,2 In fact, ultrasensitive
SiNW-FET sensors have been successfully employed for the real-time
and label-free detection of proteins,1−4 nucleic acids,5−7 viruses,8,9 and different targeted substances.1,10−16 Moreover, in comparison with other nanostructure-based sensors,
the SiNW-FET sensors have more commercial potential due to their feasibility
for mass production in semiconductor industry, especially by the so-called
top–down process.3 However, applying
FET nanosensors in clinical trials to detect biomolecules is severely
hindered by the ionic screening effect, also known as Debye screening,
caused by the high ionic strength of physiological environment (>100
mM).17 Thus, there are many methods to
subdue their detrimental effects on bio-FETs such as performing detection
in diluted solutions with low ionic strength2,4−7,18 and/or employing small molecules
as bioreceptors (antibody fragment,4,18 DNA aptamer,19 RNA aptamer20). Gao
et al. revealed another approach to overcome this obstacle by modifying
SiNW surface with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to expand the detectable
region for biosensing prostate-specific antigen in 150 mM phosphate
buffer (PB).21 To elucidate factors influencing
the detection sensitivity of SiNW-FET biosensors via screening effect,
while Zhang and co-workers announced that this variable is strongly
dependent on the distance between the negatively charge layers of
DNA and the nanowire surface,7 De Vico
et al., using theoretical simulation, went a step further to demonstrate
that the distribution of various charged groups (positive and negative)
throughout protein and their distances to the sensing surface are
both determinants.22 Furthermore, different
binding orientations also contribute to dissimilar recorded signal
of an immunoassay due to the bulky size and stearic structure of proteins.
Nevertheless, to date, there are insufficient data to completely unveil
the mystery. Hence, a solution is necessary to overcome these limitations
for the detection of protein by FETs in clinical settings, which is
the ultimate goal of profuse biomedical applications.23

Aptamers, single-stranded oligonucleotides that can
be selected
from an in vitro process referred to as systematic evolution of ligands
by exponential enrichment (SELEX), are capable of binding with numerous
molecules with high affinity and specificity.24 Improvement of the SELEX technique during recent years has also
resulted in the development of diverse aptamers that can specifically
target immunoresponses.24 Aptamers have
received exhaustive attention for immunoassay because of several advantages.
First, it is easy to generate functional aptamers from the reversible
production of the aptamer–target complex24 or chemical synthesis of sequential phosphoramidite.25 Second, bioactivity of aptamers is stable over
a wide range of thermal conditions.25 Third,
the aptamer–protein binding may favorably be detected by FET
even with the screening effect of Debye length regarding to its comparatively
small size.25 More importantly, aptamers
with highly negative charged density possibly suppress the effectiveness
of various charge groups in proteins and consequently enhance the
signal of the FET-based immunosensors. We also propose this hypothesis
as a solution for the aforementioned issues by taking advantage of
the highly negative charged aptamer as an amplifier for immunoassay
in nano-FETs.

In our study, R18, an RNA aptamer recognizing
rabbit immunoglobulin
G (IgG) with high affinity and specificity,26 was utilized as an amplifier for nano-FET-based immunosensors. We
chose 6×-histidine with its respective rabbit IgGs for direct
immunoassay as well as amyloid β 1–42 (Aβ 1–42)
with mouse-capturing (IgG1) and rabbit-detection (IgG) antibody for
a sandwich type immunoassay. The former is applied in protein engineering
such as studies of protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions27 and protein purification,28 whereas the latter, a peptide with 42 amino acids, is ubiquitous
in the brain cortex of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).29 Amplifying the immunoassay signal of Aβ
1–42 potentially lowers its limit of detection and limit of
quantification, leading to a promising vista for the preclinical detection
of this biomarker in the early-stage diagnosis of AD, where enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, the current clinical method, is ineffective due
to its extremely low concentration in human blood.30,31

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
(3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES), glutaraldehyde, bis-Tris propane (BTP), sodium cyanoborohydride
(NaBH3CN), Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), and
hydrochloric acid (HCl) were delivered by Sigma-Aldrich. Ethanol (99%)
was ordered from Echo Chemical Co., Ltd and chemical for photoresist
layer removal (EKC 830, component: 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol and N-methyl-2-pyrrolydone) was from DuPont. Two peptides (6×-histidine:
HHH HHH, Aβ 1–42: DAE FRH DSG YEV HHQ KLV FFA EDV GSN
KGA IIG LMV GGV VIA) and their specific antibodies (mouse antibody:
isotype IgG1, rabbit antibody: isotype IgG) were supplied by Abcam
plc. (U.K.). 10 mM Tris, 10 mM and 150 mM BTP buffers were all prepared
in deionized water and adjusted to pH of 7.4 by HCl. The other chemicals
for this research were of reagent grade.

R18 aptamer (74-mer
RNA sequence: 5′-GGGAG AAUUC CGACC AGAAG UUCGA UACGC CGUGG
GGUGA CGUUG GCUAC CCUUU CCUCU CUCCU CCUUC UUCU-3′),26 which can distinguish rabbit IgG, was synthesized
in our laboratory by polymerase chain reaction and RNA transcription
from its complementary DNA (cDNA). The former was carried out by primers
and cDNA template acquired through MDBio within DreamTaq DNA Polymerase
and DreamTaq Buffer supplied by ThermoScientific, the latter was implemented
by T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System from Promega.

2.2 Apparatuses and SiNW-FET Characteristics
The SiNW-FET in this study, fabricated by National Nano Device
Laboratory of National Chiao Tung University (Hsinchu, Taiwan), was
also used in our previous works.6,32,33 Length and width of each nanowire channel on the n-type device are
2 μm and 80 nm, respectively. Keithley 2636 Dual-channel System
Source Meter Instrument and a probe station with a chamber (Everbeing)
were employed to measure the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the SiNW-FET sensor.
A programming syringe pump (KD Scientific) and a microfluidic system
possessing channel dimension of 5 × 0.5 × 0.1 mm3 were integrated with the fabricated sensor to transport the liquids
continuously through the nanowires at a flow rate of 5 mL/h. Before
performing biomolecular interactions with the SiNW-FET biochip to
analyze its immunoassay through drain current–gate voltage
(Id–Vg) curve, gauging the current of the fabricated sensor was triplicated
after incubating it in 150 mM BTP buffer for 5 min to regulate its
signal and establish the baseline to evaluate the electrical properties
produced from biorecognition events.

2.3 Immobilization
of Biomolecules on SiNW-FET
Surface
Initially, the SiNW-FET chips were cleansed to remove
the photoresist layer by immersing in EKC 830 at 95 °C for 20
min, followed by 10 min sonication in deionized water and drying with
nitrogen for three times. These SiNW-FET chips were then treated with
oxygen plasma for 10 min before chemical surface modification with
APTES and glutaraldehyde. This stage started with gentle shaking of
the chips in a 2% APTES solution (99% ethanol as the solvent) for
30 min on a platform rocker operating at 60 rpm and ambient temperature.
Afterward, they were sonicated in 99% ethanol to remove the APTES
residues and treated at 120 °C for 10 min. This procedure was
completed with glutaraldehyde functionalization by gently shaking
the APTES-modified SiNW-FET chip at 60 rpm and room temperature in
a container of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 10 mM BTP for 60 min, followed
by sonication in 10 mM BTP for 10 min to remove glutaraldehyde residues.
These SiNW-FET chips were finally ready for biomolecular immobilization.

The bioprobes (hexahistidine or mouse anti-Aβ1-42 antibody) were immobilized on the surface of APTES-glutaraldehyde-modified
chips by incubating them in sealed Petri dishes at 4 °C overnight
with 10 mM BTP solution containing 0.4% NaBH3CN and either
1 μg/mL hexahistidine or mouse anti-Aβ1-42 IgG1 on the surface. The next day, these chips were initially shaken
in 10 mM BTP for 10 min by a platform rocker to remove nonspecific
binding on the nanowire surface. Eventually, 0.4% NaBH3CN in 10 mM Tris was utilized as a blocking buffer for the FET surface
by shaking it twice on a platform rocker for 10 min each within the
buffer exchange before the final purification by deionized water and
desiccation by nitrogen. These immune-SiNW-FET chips were then ready
to be installed into the FET system for biosensing measurements.

2.4 Direct and Sandwich Immunoassay by SiNW-FET
and Signal Amplification by Aptamer
Enhancement of the signal
produced from direct immunoassays of the 6×-histidine peptide
immobilized on the sensor surface is illustrated in Figure 1. After installing the SiNW-FET
chip in the instrument system and stabilizing the signal of the Id–Vg curve
in the BTP buffer, BTP containing 1 μg/mL anti-hexahistidine
rabbit IgG was transported through the nanowire field-effect transistor
(NWFET) sensor at a rate of 5 mL/h for 10 min. The Id–Vg curve was then
plotted after a 30 min incubation with this IgG and a 10 min washing
with the BTP buffer. Subsequently, R18 aptamer was injected into the
SiNW-FET sensor at similar rate and time used for antibody transportation
(Figure 1). The Id–Vg curve
was also measured again after a 30 min incubation and a 10 min washing
with the BTP buffer. These procedures were also repeated to enhance
the signal begot by sandwich immunoassay with Aβ 1–42.
However, an additional phase of injection–incubation–washing
with rabbit anti-Aβ1-42 antibody was required
between the treatments of Aβ 1–42 and R18 to assure the
presence of this RNA aptamer on the sensor surface (Figure 2).

(red Y shapes), which reacts with amino acids 33–42 of Aβ
1–42 peptide, followed by (D) R18 RNA aptamer (green curves)
for signal enhancement.

3 Results and Discussion
In a SiNW-FET
system, the receptors are immobilized on the nanowire
surface to detect the analytes with highly specific binding affinity.
The recognition of the targets by the probes changes surface potential
and modulates the channel conductance, which are recorded and further
processed by the electrical measurement system. Since our chips are
n-type FETs, accumulation of charge carriers by capturing positive
charged molecules of the anchored bioreceptors increases the conductance
and depletion of charge carriers due to the binding of negative charged
molecules with immobilized recognition elements results in the reduction
of conductance. We used 150 mM BTP buffer and pH 7.4 for our experiments,
which are not only identical with the binding conditions of R18 and
rabbit IgG in the SELEX process26 but also
approximately analogous to the physiological condition. In this study,
the electrical data were quantitatively analyzed by selecting the
drain current (Id) at 10–9 A (LgI = −9 in Figures 3 and 4) and calculating the
change of gate voltage (ΔV) initiated by the
formation of biocomplexes (hexahistidine-IgG, hexahistidine-IgG-R18,
IgG1-Aβ1–42, IgG1-Aβ1–42-IgG-R18) from the formula 1  where Vd1 is the
gate voltage for the electrical response actuated after the binding
of the biological entities (Aβ 1–42 to mouse anti-Aβ1-42 IgG1; rabbit anti-hexahistidine IgG to 6×-His,
R18 RNA aptamer to two kinds of rabbit antibodies) at Id = 10–9 A (LgI = −9) and Vd0 is the gate voltage for the electric response
generated by the 150 mM BTP buffer (baseline) at Id = 10–9 A (LgI = −9). Statistical
data for each experiment were collected from fifteen devices of at
least three distinctive biochips (five devices per chip) manufactured
by different batch productions.

(ΔVR18-BTP = 64 ± 13
mV) or rabbit anti-Aβ1-42 IgG (ΔVR18-BTP = 41 ± 19 mV).

3.1 Immunoassay of Hexahistidine by SiNW-FET and
Signal Stabilization by R18
Electric currents of the SiNW-FET
sensors for the anchored 6×-histidine peptide and rabbit IgG
complex on the sensing surface are characterized in Figure 1. Evidently, there are three
dissimilar trends in the signal produced by the sensors after injection
of rabbit IgG. On the one hand, the lower drain current (ΔV = 320 ± 203 mV in the inset of Figure 3A) after the peptide–IgG complex formation
is attributed to a depletion of charge carriers on the modified surface,
suggesting that the net charge of the antibody is negative at pH 7.4.
On the other hand, a higher drain current in Figure 3B (inset: ΔV = −237
± 114 mV) indicates a positive net charge of the antibody at
pH 7.4, which resulted in an accumulation of charge carriers on the
fabricated surface. In addition, there is also almost unchanged electrical
signal before and after transportation of the rabbit anti-hexahistidine
antibody to the immobilized peptide (Figure 3C and its insets: ΔV = 1 ± 49 mV). Except the variations from chip production and
surface modification process, the distance between the antibody and
the silicon surface is also a key factor, which is very difficult
to uniformly control in this direct immunoassay. Indeed, distinctive
charged groups distributed throughout the IgG molecules differently
affect the sensing surface due to their various distances to the nanowire,
which are managed by individual binding orientations of these antibodies,
and the screening effect. Besides, the signal-to-noise ratio possibly
contributes to the unsteady electrical signal of the immunoassay by
nano-FETs. In summary, it is unable to detect the signal produced
by the immunoassay of 6×-histidine peptide and its corresponding
rabbit IgG from irregular electrical response of SiNW-FET due to the
screening effect and binding orientation of the antibody (ΔV = 28 ± 268 mV in Figure 3D).

The applicability of the synthesized
R18 RNA aptamer for the signal amplification of direct immunoassay
with 6×-histidine on the SiNW-FET sensor was investigated at
final concentration of approximately 6 μg/mL. Obviously, the
R18 aptamer could bind with the IgG of the rabbit anti-hexahistidine
antibody and activate apparent conductance changes in the FET-based
nanosensors. Notably, the current always considerably declined with
the R18 aptamer regardless to its unsteadiness induced by the rabbit
IgG (Figure 3A–C).
According to the calculated result by eq 1, the formed aptamer–antibody–peptide
complex in this experiment provoked a different potential from the
baseline ΔV = 719 ± 110 mV (Figure 3D), which not only vanished
the discrepancy but also amplified the signal of the 6×-His immunoassay
in SiNW-FET. A minor potential change ΔV =
36 ± 14 mV (data are not illustrated) obtained after incubating
R18 on the modified surface without rabbit IgG evinces that this RNA
aptamer was not recognized by histidine chains, eliminating suspicion
about the nonspecific binding contributing to the enhanced outcome.
High specificity between R18 and rabbit IgG is therefore vital for
this proof of concept.

3.2 Signal Stabilization by
R18 for Amyloid β
1–42 Detection by SiNW-FET
Motivated by the success
of the R18 aptamer for the direct immunoassay of 6×-histidine,
we exploited it for the immunoassay of human Aβ 1–42,
a longer peptide with 42 amino acids, in which this peptide was detected
by a mouse antibody corresponding to its amino acids 1–17 immobilized
on the surface of the SiNW-FET. Figure 4 describes the recorded signal from the immunosensors
before and after exposure to Aβ 1–42, the rabbit IgG
recognizing amino acids 33–42 of Aβ 1–42, and
the aptamer. They shuffle to both left (rise up with ΔV = −198 ± 7 mV, Figure 4B) and right (fall down with ΔV = 175 ± 17 mV, Figure 4A) sides of the baseline, indicating an inconsistency
in the current trends caused by Aβ 1–42. Thus, the potency
of the R18 aptamer in stabilizing the signal was examined through
the assistance of the rabbit antibody mentioned above. Theoretically,
its epitope is able to detect amino acids 33–42 of Aβ
1–42, on one hand, and its constant region is capable of binding
with the R18 aptamer, on the other hand.26 Apparently, these binding reactions could activate current changes
in the sensor. Similar to the acquisition from the direct immunoassay
of 6×-His, a sharply weakened current of the sensors is always
observed after contacting with the RNA aptamer (ΔV = 208 ± 31 mV from the baseline in Figure 4C). Additionally, inspecting the relation
of nonspecific binding between rabbit IgG and R18 to the sensing channels
by incubating sensors in them without detecting Aβ 1–42
resulted in ΔV = 64 ± 13 mV (Figure 4D), referring to
the insignificant contribution of the nonspecific binding between
the fabricated surface and the rabbit IgG and/or R18 aptamer to signal
enhancement. Finally, the sensors were also exposed to R18 without
the presence of the rabbit antibody on their surfaces after capturing
the peptide and generated a trivial voltage shift (ΔV = 41 ± 19 mV from the baseline in Figure 2D), which is supposedly due
to the noise of the signal. It establishes the fact that R18 is only
recognized by the rabbit IgG and undetected by any peptide. The rabbit
IgG (for instance, corresponding to amino acids 33–42 of Aβ
1–42 in this experiment) is hence indispensable and plays a
crucial part in stabilizing and amplifying the signal changes actuated
by Aβ 1–42. This immunoassay accordingly becomes a so-calledsandwich
immunoassay.

3.3 Aptamer—Pivotal
Appearance and Inevitable
Involvement in Future Prospects of Immuno-FET Nanosensors
In fact, the R18 aptamer is not only a molecule that specifically
binds with the rabbit IgG but also an RNA sequence that carries copious
amount of negatively charged phosphate group in its sequence. For
those reasons, the R18 aptamer feasibly binds to the rabbit IgG antibody
on the sensor surface and suppresses the effectiveness of different
charged groups distributed throughout the antibody structure as well
as improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the SiNW-FET to result in
a significant reduction in conductance and achieve signal stabilization
and amplification of the immunoassays on the FET-based nanosensors.
Remarkably, in comparison with a secondary antibody, the R18 aptamer
is not only more compact but also recognizes rabbit IgG with at least
two target binding sites (residues G20, U21, and G24 in stem 1 and
residues U38, C41, G45, and C47 in loop 2 of its secondary structure)
and almost entirely covers rabbit IgG.26 As a result, their binding interaction almost takes place within
the same Debye length of the antibody, and the negative charges carried
by the R18 aptamer are not severely weakened by the screening effect,
suggesting that electrical responses to the silicon surface are detectable
in the measurement. Additionally, we also suppose that the R18 binding
to rabbit IgG can trigger intermolecular repulsive forces to modulate
the intermolecular layer of the peptide–antibody complex, therefore
a positive and steady electrical signal is distinguishable after using
the R18 aptamer. Generally, signal enhancement is mainly contributed
by this highly negative charged R18 aptamer. Relevant to vigorous
negative charged oligonucleotides on nano-FETs, Gao et al., in an
effort to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of nanowire devices, used
a rolling circle amplification (RCA) reaction to yield a long single-stranded
DNA for achieving ultrasensitive hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA detection.34 Binding of prolific repeated sequences of RCA
products created significantly amplified signal from abundant negative
charges on the nanowire surface.34 These
features indicate that the designed solution is feasible and provides
excellent efficiency for signal enhancement on the SiNW-FET sensors.
Compared to previous publications on similar topics,2,4−7,17,18 this method directly accomplished the biodetection in such a high
ionic strength condition of up to 150 mM BTP without dissecting the
antibody for antigen-binding fragments or expanding sensible area
through desalting action. It is consequently more precise, convenient,
time-saving, and particularly advantageous for assays in which analyte
dilution is inappropriate and must be operated in serum samples with
a diversity of proteins. For instance, diluting plasma samples of
AD markers is seemingly impractical due to its ultralow concentration
in human blood and cerebrospinal fluid (<1 pM).35 Moreover, this sensing strategy is appropriate not only
for direct immunoassay, which includes immobilizing antigen (target
molecule) on the sensor surface and dissolving antibody (receptor)
in the solution, but also sandwich immunoassay, which contains antigen
(target molecule) between two layers of antibodies (capture and detection
antibody), on the SiNWFET sensors. There are multiple options of aptamer
and capture and detection antibody for both immunoassay models provided
that the association between the detection antibody and the aptamer
is validated. For example, an 84-mer DNA aptamer specifying mouse
IgG36 may equivalently effectuate the signal
of SiNWFET immunosensors as R18 did. In summary, we conclude that
the antibody–aptamer coalition is an exclusive approach and
irresistible for application of the SiNW-FET sensors to stabilize
and enhance the signal detected from both direct and sandwich immunoassays.

4 Conclusions
In SiNW-FET-based biosensors, since the screening effect imposed
by the ionic strength of physiological environment has detrimental
consequence on their sensitivity, signal recognition of immunoassay
is severely hindered by the individual distance of several charged
group distributed throughout the protein structure to the sensing
surface and the binding orientation of the analytes with the bioreceptors.
Herein, we demonstrate that specific binding of aptamer–antibody
could steadily produce a substantial conductance change and aptamer
is practically applied as a signal amplifier for the SiNW-FET immunosensors
because of its high charge density and relatively small molecular
framework. The suggested solution, being reported for the first time,
is proved to be successful for both direct (6×-histidine) and
sandwich (Aβ 1–42) immunoassays with rabbit IgG antibody.
The strategy offered in this study is potentially applicable for the
detection of other macromolecules with different charged group in
vitro and in vivo by nano-FETs.
