Atomic charges were investigated
as functions of detectable atomic
and molecular constants at equilibrium structures. It was found based
upon the variation idea that atomic charges in highly ionic molecules
can be expressed as a function of molecular dipole moments, polarizabilities
of free cations, and polarizabilities of free neutral atoms of the
corresponding anions. The function can be given in the form of classical
Rittner’s relationship (J. Chem. Phys. 1951, 19, 1030). For the ground states of
alkali halide molecules, the predicted atomic charges are close to
an elementary charge e and the predicted dipole moments
are in good agreement with the observed values; for spin-restricted
high-ionic systems such as the lowest 9Σ electronic
states of BN, AlN, GaN, BP, AlP, GaP, BAs, AlAs, and GaAs molecules,
the predicted atomic charges are also near 1e and
in good agreement with the results of natural population analysis
at MRCI/cc-pvqz and HF/6-311+G(3df) levels. Polarizabilities for the
lowest quintet states of B–, Al–, Ga–, N+, P+, and As+ ions were also obtained based upon high-level ab initio computations.
Atomic charges from other related methods are also investigated for
comparison. The results demonstrate that high-quality atomic charges
can be obtained with detectable variables, such as molecular dipole
moment, vibrational frequency, as well as polarizabilities of the
related free atoms and ions.

1 Introduction
Atomic
charges are also known as the polarized partial charges
in molecular systems. With atomic charges, theoretical insights can
be obtained for mapping atomic activities or atomic properties in
molecules. Atomic charges are therefore important in fields of molecular
science and have attracted the interest of many related researchers.1−9 Among various definitions for atomic charges,10−26 a large amount of them are defined based upon the electron population
analysis or the partition of electron density from ab initio or density
functional computations, such as Mulliken population analysis,10 natural population analysis (NPA),11 Bader’s quantum theory of atoms in molecules
(AIM),1 and so on.12,13 Atomic charges are also defined based on computational physical
observables such as dipole moment15,16 or electrostatic
potential17−19 and a set of fitted empirical parameters. Though
it is hard to detect atomic charges directly and accurately with present
experimental techniques, people believe that they are intrinsically
related to detectable properties such as dipole moment, polarizabilities,
internuclear separations, and so on.27

Atomic charges defined based upon pure experimental variables are
of special significance for the investigation of connections between
different physical variables in molecular systems. In addition, high-quality
atomic charges with computed detectable variables may also be used
as an important reference to evaluate the quality of related theoretical
studies. The simplest form of empirical atomic charges is the point
charge model, from which the atomic charges can be estimated with q = μd/Re for
general diatomic systems, where μd is the dipole
moment and Re is the equilibrium internuclear
distance. For high-ionic systems, a classical consideration for the
relationship between atomic charges and detectable physical variables
was given by Rittner,28 in which the polarizabilities
of species in the molecules were used to consider the effects from
static polarization. Recently, Hou and Bernath29 presented another relationship, in which the zero point
energy or the harmonic vibrational frequency was introduced to consider
the influences of polarization effects.

As expected, different
definitions or different parameterizations
may give different predictions for atomic charges. However, for highly
ionic systems, unphysical results were often obtained with high quality
observed and/or computed data. For example, for the well-known complete
ionic systems such as the Rb and Cs halides, the atomic charges from
the observed dipole moments and equilibrium internuclear separations
(q = μd/Re) are less than 0.8e (e.g., 0.70e–0.75e); such data mean that the percent
ionicities for these compounds are less than 80%, which is far lower
than the expectations (∼100%) for complete ionic species.

For alkali halide molecules, the original Rittner model and its
truncated form (T-Rittner)28,30−33 had been used to investigate molecular spectral properties such
as binding energies, molecular spectroscopic constants, and so on
with experimentally detectable variables, based on the assumption
that the molecules were completely ionized, that is, the atomic charges
were 1e. However, for a large part of the molecules,
the predicted atomic charges with the same relationships were far
larger than the expected values. To improve the quality of predictions,
the above-mentioned Rittner relationships had been widely investigated,30−33 including the assumption of the polarizabilities for species in
molecules were functions of the potentials between ions in molecules
and so on.31,32 This made the polarizabilities
of species in molecules not detectable; therefore, the corresponding
atomic charges were not functions of complete experimental variables.
It can be easily found that the original Rittner relationship and
the previously modified model cannot present consistent results between
atomic charges and the corresponding experimentally/theoretically
determined high-quality physical variables (including the polarizabilities
of free species). The main purpose of the present work is to address
such a problem.

In this work, analytic functions for atomic
charges, especially
the Rittner relationships,28,30 were reinvestigated
and modified so that the predicted atomic charges were consistent
with the related experimental and/or computed physical variables.
The modified models were tested with the ground states (1Σ) of alkali halides and extended to the theoretically determined
spin-restricted high-ionic systems such as the lowest nonet states
(9Σ) of BN, AlN, GaN, BP, AlP, GaP, BAs, AlAs, and
GaAs molecules. The results were also compared with data from other
related methods, including pure ab initio NPA and/or AIM charges.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Theoretical Considerations
From the
classical Rittner28 relationship for dipole
moment (in atomic units) 1  the atomic charge q can be
expressed as eq 2 when
replacing electronic charge e with q for general highly ionic molecules 2  where αA+ and
αB– are the ionic polarizabilities
of the corresponding cations and anions in highly ionic molecules
A+B–.

On the basis of a perturbation
treatment, Brumer and Karplus30 obtained
an approximate form of eq 1, known as “T-Rittner” relationship for dipole moment 3  

Similarly, from the T-Rittner relationship eq 3, the atomic charge can be expressed as 4  

To test the qualities of the above relationships, experimental
dipole moments μd, observed equilibrium separations Re, and high-quality theoretically or experimentally
derived polarizabilities α from ref (34) were adopted. The results from eqs 1–4 are out of expectation because the predicted charges are systematically
large; see in Figure 1 in next section. Considering the estimated uncertainties (∼2%)
of the literature ionic polarizabilities, such discrepancies (+20
to +40% for lithium halides) are possibly introduced neither by the
theoretical polarizabilities nor by the experimental Re and μd. They are typical kind of systematic
errors.

Figure 1 Atomic charges for the ground states of alkali halide molecules.
All the dipole moments (except CsBr and CsI35), equilibrium internuclear separations, and polarizabilities used
in atomic charge calculations were taken from ref (34). The NPA charges were
computed at the MRCI/cc-pvqz level with Molpro.

To solve the above problem, the atomic/ionic polarizabilities
of
species in molecules were taken as functionals of atomic charges,
such as αAq+ = αA+ + λ(αA–αA+) and αBq– = αB+λ(αB– – αB), where λ
(0 ≤ λ ≤ 1) is a variation parameter, with conditions
αA+ ≲ αAq+ ≲ αA and αB– ≳ αBq– ≳ αB, where αA and αB are the polarizabilities of the corresponding
neutral atoms A and B and αA+ and αB– are the polarizabilities of the free cation
A+ and free anion B–. At last, we find
that αAq+ = αA+ and αBq– = αB are the simplest functional
(i.e., λ = 0) which can give reasonable predictions for highly
ionic systems. Therefore, a more accurate Rittner-type relationship
can be expressed as 5  

Similar modification
can be made to the truncated form of Rittner
relationship. Equations 2, 4, and 5 are used to
calculate the atomic charges in typical high-ionic systems and are
compared with the results from the relationship given by Hou and Bernath,29 which is also a function of detectable physical
variables 6  where k is a constant related
to units only. k = 137.87436 for reduced mass μA in atomic mass units (amu), μd in Debye
(D), ωe (harmonic vibrational frequency) in cm–1, Re in Å, and q in e. Details on eq 6 can be found in ref (29). Because μAωe2 is also the force constant of the
molecule, the atomic charge from eq 6 is also a function of molecular force constant. Note
for convenience to application that the right-hand sides of eqs 2, 4, and 5 need to be divided by a conversion
factor, 4.8032, so that the units of related variables are similar
to those in eq 6.

2.2 Computational Results
The above-mentioned
relationships are tested with two sets of typical high-ionic systems.
One set is the ground states (X1Σ) of alkali halide
molecules, which are well-known high-ionic molecules based on the
knowledge of general chemistry. Another set is spin-restricted theoretical
high-ionic systems, the lowest 9Σ states of BN, AlN,
GaN, BP, AlP, GaP, BAs, AlAs, and GaAs molecules (hereafter BN-group
molecules), for which the ab initio computations present complete
ionic characters. Atomic charges from observed34,35 and/or computed molecular constants (ωe, Re, μd) and free atomic/ionic
polarizabilities34 are used in Rittner
and T-Rittner relationships. In eq 6, the atomic masses of the most abundant isotopes from
ref (36) are used to
calculate the corresponding reduced masses. The atomic charges obtained
with eqs 2 and 4–6 are compared with
theoretical atomic charges from Hartree–Fock (HF) and the internally
contracted multiconfiguration reference configuration interaction
(MRCI)37−39 calculations. The MRCI computations were performed
with Molpro;40,41 the HF computations were performed
with Gaussian.42 The 6-311+G(3df) and cc-pvqz
basis sets43−51 embedded in the suites were used.

Atomic charges computed
with ab initio methods include AIM (calculated with Gaussian), NPA,
and Mulliken charges. The above-mentioned analytic relationships,
including the point charge model, the original Rittner, T-Rittner,
and the modified Rittner forms in the present work, are investigated
with both theoretical and experimental data (if available). All the
detailed results are presented in Supporting Information (Tables S1–S4). For clarity, only AIM and NPA charges are
compared in the text with those from eqs 2 and 4–6.

2.2.1 Ground States of Alkali Halides
Atomic charges for the ground states of alkali halide molecules are
given in Figure 1 and
are compared with the NPA charges from MRCI/cc-pvqz computations.
All the observed data are taken from ref (34) except the dipole moments for CsBr and CsI,
which are taken from the database of NIST Webbook.35 The polarizabilities for free atoms and ions of halides
and alkali elements used in this work, which are recommended by ref (34), are listed in Table 1. Except that for
the iodine atom, no experimental polarizabilities for other species
in Table 1 are available
to us.

Table 1 Polarizabilities Used for Dipole Moments
and Atomic Charges in the Ground-State Alkali Halide Molecules

 	 	 	 	Cs+	2.42	
a Observed data, with uncertainty
25%. The recommended theoretical value was 4.7 Å3,34 the uncertainty was also 25%. In the present
work, the value 5.35 Å3 was used.

The results in Figure 1 show that the original Rittner
model (shown with “-▼-”)
gives relatively large predictions (q ≳ 1.1e) for Na, K, Rb, and Cs halides and too large predictions
(q ≳ 1.2e) for lithium halides.
Compared with the original Rittner model, the T-Rittner model (shown
with “-◆-”) seems to provide better predictions,
but only for part of the molecules (K, Rb, and Cs halides) the atomic
charges are highly improved. For Li and Na halides, only slight improvements
are achieved. Equation 5, in which the polarizability of anions in the original Rittner model
is reduced to polarizability of the corresponding free atom, can provide
far better predictions (shown with “-▲-”) for
all alkali halides. Such results show that the quality of the predicted
atomic charges can be highly improved by the modification of polarizabilities
of the anions in highly ionic molecules. For some of the light species,
the NPA charges (shown with “○”) from MRCI/cc-pvqz
computations are also listed for comparison. Compared with the charges
from eqs 2 and 4, it is clear that the charges (eq 5) are close to the NPA data. The differences
to the NPA charges are not larger than 0.1e for LiF,
LiCl, LiBr, NaF, NaCl, and NaBr molecules. Note that eq 6 also presents high-quality predictions
(“-■-”) with observed molecular constants ωe, Re, and μd.
For molecules except lithium halides, the predicted atomic charges
from eqs 5 and 6 are in good agreement. For lithium halides except
LiI (basis set not available for I), eq 6 gives better predictions to the NPA data. As expected,
the point charge model (the data are shown with “-●-”)
gives predictions lower than expectation.

Figure 2 gives the
predicted dipole moments with different approaches, including analytic
relationships, such as the point charge model and the Rittner-type
model, and the ab initio results at HF/6-311+G(3df) (indicated with
“-○-”) and MRCI/cc-pvqz (indicated with “-*-”)
theoretical levels. The atomic charges are assumed to be 1.0e in Rittner models for all the alkali halide molecules,
as done in other literature studies.28,30−33 In the point charge model, results with q = 1e (“-×-”) and the NPA atomic charges
(“-▷-”) at the HF/6-311+G(3df) level are also
given for comparison. Compared with the experimental data (“-■-”),
the predictions with the point charge model (“-×-”
and “-▷-”) are too large and the results from
the original Rittner model (“-●-”) are obviously
small for dipole moments. The results from the original T-Rittner
model (“-◆-”) are apparently improved but only
for part of the molecules in study. For the modified Rittner model, eq 5, in this work, it is clear
from Figure 2 that
the predictions (“-▲-”) are systematically consistent
with the experimental data (“-■-”). Compared
with the ab initio results, the quality for predictions from eq 5 is similar to the MRCI/cc-pvqz
(“-*-”) and HF/6-311+G(3df) (“-○-”)
results for light lithium and sodium halides and better than predictions
for potassium halides at the HF/6-311+G(3df) (“-○-”)
level.

Figure 2 Comparison between dipole moments predicted with different approaches
for the ground states of alkali halide diatomic molecules. Experimental
dipole moments are indicated with solid squares (“-■-”),
which are from the same references as in Figure 1. In the original Rittner (“-●-”),
T-Rittner (“-◆-”), and the present modified Rittner
(“-▲-”) models, the atomic charges are assumed
1e, and polarizabilities are taken from Table 1. Dipole moments from
ab initio approaches at HF/6-311+G(3df) (“-○-”)
and MRCI/cc-pvqz (“-*-”) levels, and results from the
point charge model with experimental Re (taken from ref (34)) and atomic charges taking 1e (“-×-”)
and the NPA charges (“-▷-”) at the HF/6-311+G(3df)
level, respectively, are also present for comparison.

For predictions from eq 5, the percentage error in average is 2.2%
for all of the 20
alkali halide molecules. Note the largest of the errors is |−6.8%|
(of LiI). From the data given in ref (34), such a largest error is most possibly introduced
from the uncertainty (25%) of the observed polarizability (5.35 Å3) for the free iodine atom. For heavy atoms, it is also very
difficult to obtain accurate predictions from ab initio computation;
the uncertainty was also 25% for the recommended computational data
(4.7 Å3) for this atom.34 The value used at present is the observed data 5.35 Å3; when it is reduced to 5.0 Å3, the error is decreased
to |−2.8%|. For other molecules, the predictions are excellently
good. The mean percentage errors of the original Rittner model and
the T-Rittner model are 12 and 7.7%, respectively. These data indicate
that the modified model (eq 5) in the present work can give far better predictions than
the other two similar models. The results of the predicted dipole
moments also indicate that the relationship (eq 5) is self-consistent.

The predicted
atomic charges with the modified T-Rittner model
(q = μd/[Re – (αA+ + αB)/Re2]) using the same polarizabilities
as those in eq 5 are
given in Table S1, which show that the
predictions of atomic charges are lower than expectation for highly
ionic molecules such as CsF (0.91e), CsCl (0.92e), and CsBr (0.90e), whereas the present
atomic charges (eq 5)
are more close to an elementary charge, CsF (0.96e), CsCl (0.97e), and CsBr (0.95e). These predictions indicate that such a modified T-Rittner relationship
is not superior to eq 5.

The results of the predicted atomic charges and dipole moments
with the modified T-Rittner model also demonstrate that the truncation
of the original Rittner model cannot essentially improve the quality
of the corresponding predictions.

The predicted dipole moments
with eq 5 are also compared
with the results from the original
and T-Rittner models (eqs 1 and 3) using polarizabilities from literature
empirical approaches,32 such as the Seitz–Ruffa
(SR)52,53 and the Wilson–Curtis–Coker
(for short, “Coker”)54−56 models. The results
are given in Figure 3. The results show that the eq 5 data (shown with “-○-”) are generally
better than those from SR and/or Coker polarizabilities. The averages
of the differences (|δ|ave) to the observed dipole
moments are 0.26 and 0.25 D for the predicted data from the SR polarizabilities32 with the original Rittner (shown with “□”)
and T-Rittner (shown with “Δ”) models, respectively.
For predictions from the Coker polarizabilities,32 the |δ|ave are 0.45 and 0.33 D for the
Rittner (shown with “◀”) and T-Rittner (shown
with “▽”) models, respectively. For the predictions
with the polarizabilities of (αA+, αB), the modified Rittner model (eq 5) gives |δ|ave = 0.21 D,
which is clearly better than the best of other predictions. The maximum
of the deviations of predictions with eq 5 is 0.52 D, which is also less than the largest deviations
of other predictions (ranges from 0.64 to 0.90 D). Details are given
in Table S2 in Supporting Information.
Such a comparison demonstrates that the present scheme is not only
simple but also of high quality in predictions; therefore, it is more
efficient than other similar models.

Figure 3 Comparison between predicted dipole moments
for the ground states
of alkali halides from Rittner-type models with different polarizabilities.
Squares (“□”) and triangles up (“Δ”)
indicate results from the SR polarizabilities32 with original (eq 1) and T-Rittner (eq 3) models, respectively. Solid triangles left (“◀”)
and triangles down (“▽”) indicate results from
the Coker polarizabilities32 with the original
Rittner and T-Rittner models, respectively. Circles (“-○-”),
results from the modified Rittner relationship (eq 5) with free-state polarizabilities of cations
and atoms collected in ref (34). Stars (“-*-”), experimental data are similar
to those in Figure 2. Note that both the SR and Coker polarizabilities were taken from
ref (32), which were
functions of other physical variables, and are listed in Table S2
in Supporting Information for comparison.

Note that eq 2, etc.,
hold at Re6 ≫ 4(αA+αB–).28 For all cases tested here, this condition is
satisfied. For eq 5,
because αB– > αB > 0, the above condition is also well satisfied.

Note in
addition that systematic comparison is also made between
atomic charges predicted with observed and computed molecular constants
at HF/6-311+G(3df) and MRCI/cc-pvqz levels. For both eqs 5 and 6, the
predicted atomic charges from theoretical molecular constants are
consistent with the predictions from experimental constants. Details
are presented in Table S3.

2.2.2 Lowest Nonet States of the First Nine N-
and B-Group Molecules
On the basis of high-level ab initio
computations, we find that the lowest nonet states of BN-group molecules
(BN, AlN, GaN, BP, AlP, GaP, BAs, AlAs, and GaAs) are also high-ionic
systems. Because there are no observed data available for such systems,
systematically comparisons are made at MRCI/cc-pvqz and HF/6-311+G(3df)
theoretical levels. Detailed results are presented in Table S4 in Supporting Information.

On the basis of
the NPA, the dominant configurations of the valence electrons are ns1npx1npy1npz1 for both the cations in the N-group (N+, P+, As+) and the anions in the B-group (B–, Al–, Ga–) in the lowest 9Σ states of BN-group molecules. The nonet spin states
of the molecules require that the corresponding cations and anions
in the molecules should be in their largest spin states, that is,
quintet states for configurations of ns1npx1npy1npz1; at the same time, the
lowest energy states of the molecules also require that the related
ions in the molecules should be in their lowest energy states. This
means that the states of the species in these BN-group molecules are
in their lowest ionic quintet states not the ground atomic states.
For such quintet states, the polarizabilities are not available to
us at present. Therefore, the polarizabilities of the lowest quintet
states of N+, P+, As+ B–, Al–, and Ga– ions are computed
and used in the calculation of atomic charges with eqs 2 and 5. Note
that the Mulliken populations also give atomic charges similar to
the NPA data, which are also listed in Table S4 for comparison.

All the data used in eqs 2 and 5 include polarizabilities
α
of all related species, and the equilibrium distances Re, dipole moments μd, and harmonic vibrational
frequencies ωe were calculated at HF/6-311+G(3df)
and MRCI/cc-pvqz levels, respectively. Note that the corresponding
polarizabilities at the MRCI/cc-pvqz theoretical level (with all electrons
correlated) were computed using a finite field approach (with the
field set to be 0.0001 a.u.) with Molpro. The obtained polarizabilities
of the corresponding ions and atoms (B, Al, Ga, B–, Al–, Ga–, N+, P+, As+) are given in Table 2 and are used in eqs 2 and 5.

The
atomic charges from MRCI/cc-pvqz and HF/6-311+G(3df) computations
for these nonet-state molecules are given in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.
As expected, the point charge model gives the smallest atomic charges
(shown with “-●-”) among the empirical models.
On the contrary, eq 2 gives the largest data (“-▼-”). The modified
Rittner model (eq 5)
gives predictions (“-▲-”) close to NPA charges
(“-○-”) in general. The predictions from eq 6 (“-■-”)
are close to the AIM (“-*-”) charges (in Figure 5). The discrepancies to the
NPA charges for predictions from both eqs 5 and 6 are within about
0.1e.

Figure 4 Comparison between NPA charges and the atomic charges
from four
analytical formulae with computed variables (μd,
ωe, Re) at the MRCI/cc-pvqz
level. Computations were performed with Molpro. The atomic and ionic
polarizabilities are taken from Table 2.

Figure 5 Comparison between ab
initio charges (AIM and NPA) and the atomic
charges from analytical formulae with computed variables (μd, ωe, Re) with
Gaussian at the HF/6-311+G(3df) level. The atomic and ionic polarizabilities
are taken from Table 2.

The results at the MRCI/cc-pvqz
level are given in Figure 4. At this level, the NPA charges
(“-○-”) are greater than about 0.95e but less than 1e; these data demonstrate that the
lowest 9Σ states of BN-group molecules are typically
highly ionic systems. From Figure 4, it is clear that the modified Rittner relationship
(eq 5) (“-▲-”)
gives atomic charges close to these NPA charges. The differences between
them are less than about 0.05e. Similar to those
of alkali halides, the atomic charges from the original Rittner model
(eq 2) (“-▼-”)
are larger than 1.0e, which seem too high compared
with the NPA data. The charges (eq 6) (“-■-”)
are slightly smaller than the NPA chargers but are far better than
the predictions from the point charge model (“-●-”).
The consistency to the NPA results demonstrates that eq 5 can give reliable predictions for
the 9Σ states of BN-group molecules at the MRCI/cc-pvqz
level.

The atomic charges at the HF/6-311+G(3df) theoretical
level are
presented in Figure 5. At this level, the AIM data (“-*-”) are also obtained.
From this figure, it is clear that the predictions from eq 5 (“-▲-”) are
also in good agreement with NPA charges (shown with “-○-”;
δ ≤ 0.05e); compared with the AIM data,
the discrepancies are about 0.1e. For eq 6, the predictions (“-■-”)
are in excellent agreement with the AIM data, the discrepancies are
less than 0.03e. For eq 2, the predicted atomic charges are too large; for GaAs,
GaP, and GaN, the predicted atomic charges are larger than 2e, which are obviously wrong. It is clear that the quality
of eq 5 is far better
than eq 2. Results in
this figure show that at the HF/6-311+G(3df) level, both eqs 5 and 6 can
provide high-quality predictions for the atomic charges of highly
ionic systems investigated in this work.

For all the nine high-spin
BN-group molecules, results in Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the
predictions from eq 5 are highly improved than those from the original
Rittner model eq 2. The
data from eq 5 are comparable
to the NPA charges at MRCI and HF levels. For the predictions from eq 6, they are highly consistent
with the AIM charges from HF computations, which were demonstrated
to be stable with respect to the levels of theory,57 such as HF, DFT, and MP2 (the AIM charges at the MRCI level
are not computed in this study).

2.3 Discussion
The classical method,
for example, the original Rittner model eq 2, cannot provide satisfactory predictions
for either atomic charges or dipole moments; this can be seen from
the results for the ground states of alkali halide molecules. In the
original Rittner model,28 it is reasonable
for the prediction of dipole moments with the atomic charges assuming
to be unit charge for such typical complete ionic systems. However,
the predicted atomic charges are not consistent with this assumption;
which are systematically larger than 1e. Such results
therefore demonstrate that there is something wrong with the use of
the original Rittner model eq 2. On the basis of the qualities of the experimental dipole
moments and the observed internuclear separations, it is easy to find
that the trouble mainly lies in the polarizabilities used. The main
reason lies in the fact that the polarizabilities for the corresponding
free ions are not suitable for the bonded ions in molecules at equilibriums.
This is why the predicted atomic charges are abnormally high (q > 1.3e) for molecules such as LiCl,
LiBr,
and LiI.

To seek a better relationship for improving the quality
of the polarizabilities for bonded ions in highly ionic molecules,
various functional and approaches have been tested. Finally, we found
that when supposing the polarizabilities of bonded species (αAq+ and αBq–, 0 < q ≤
1) as functionals of a free adjustable parameter λ, in forms
of αAq+ = αA+ + λ(αA – αA+) and αBq– = αB + λ(αB– – αB), where 0 ≤
λ ≤ 1, concise and high-quality results can be obtained
at λ = 0. Then the following approximations are obtained for
the polarizabilities of species in highly ionic molecules: (1) bonded
cation ≈ free cation and (2) bonded anion ≈ free atom.
The results of eq 5 demonstrate
that such approximations are practical and reliable for the species
in highly ionic molecules. The application of eq 5 to the lowest states of the nonet BN-group
molecules demonstrates that it is also suitable for spin-restricted
highly ionic systems under high-level computations, such as MRCI/cc-pvqz.

For the BN-group molecules, the excellent agreement between the
data (eq 6) and the AIM charges indicates that such an analytical
expression for atomic charges in molecules also presents a close connection
with experimentally detectable variables, such as ωe, Re, and μd for spin-restricted
highly ionic diatomic states. The agreement to NPA and/or AIM data
demonstrates that the qualities of predictions from eq 6 are also acceptable. The agreement
between the results from eqs 5 and 6 also indicates that eq 5 can provide high-quality predictions
among empirical relationships for high-ionic, high-spin species.

The differences between the results of eqs 2 and 5 indicate that
the polarizabilities of species in molecules will influence the quality
of the predicted atomic charges; therefore, the quality of the atomic/anion
polarizabilities is important for obtaining high-quality predictions.
The ab initio results presented in Table 2 show that the basis sets also influence
the quality of the computed atomic/ionic polarizabilities; therefore,
additional efforts are needed, in general, to obtain high-quality
atomic polarizabilities in theoretical computations. For highly ionic
systems, the relationship of eq 5 may also be used to investigate the atomic polarizabilities.

For alkali halides, the excellent agreement between observed dipole
moments and the predicted data from eq 5 was reached, except LiI; for this molecule, the discrepancy
was relatively high, −6.8% (δ ≈ −0.5 D).
From ref (34), we find
that the estimated uncertainties were 25% for the polarizabilities
of the iodine atom for both experimental (5.35 Å3)
and calculated (4.7 Å3) data recommended in ref (34). When taking the error
of the predicted dipole moment for LiI to be zero, the estimated polarizability
for the free I atom is 4.75 Å3, which is nearly identical
to the recommended theoretical value 4.7 Å3. In the
same way, the polarizabilities for the I atom are estimated from NaI,
KI, RbI, and CsI; interestingly, the average of all these five predictions
(including that from LiI) is 5.33 Å3, which is nearly
similar to the recommended observed value. Using the same approach,
the obtained mean polarizabilities for atoms F, Cl, and Br are 0.66,
2.40, and 3.41 (in Å3), respectively. These data are
similar to the polarizabilities (F = 0.557, Cl = 2.18, Br = 3.05 (in
Å3); see in Table 1) for free atoms in ref (34) and/or the polarizabilities32 for related anions in molecules (see in Table S2). These results also demonstrate that the relationship
(eq 5) can be used as
a simple approximation for investigating the polarizabilities of atoms
in high-ionic systems with detectable molecular constants.

As
to the molecules studied here, we find that the nonet states
of BN-group molecules are high-ionic, high-spin, and relative stable
species with large dipole moments. In addition, the populations of
atomic charges of the atoms/ions in the molecules are inversed compared
with the ground-state species, that is, the B-group species have negative
charges (i.e., B–, Al–, and Ga–), whereas the N-group elements have positive charges
(i.e., N+, P+, and As+). These special
properties are quite different from those of normal molecules in their
ground electronic states; therefore, they may have special significance
for the investigation of molecular properties under electric and/or
magnetic fields for special purpose.

All the results for 29
highly ionic molecules studied in this work,
including the singlet states of 20 alkali halide molecules and the
nonet states of the first nine BN-group spin-excited 9Σ
molecules, demonstrate that eq 5 can provide predictions close to results from high-quality
ab initio and/or other empirical approaches. The results for the BN-group
molecules demonstrate that eq 5 is also suitable for spin-restricted highly ionic states.

Keep in mind that eq 2, etc., hold at Re6 ≫
4(αA+αB–).28 If this condition is not satisfied,
the predictions with those relationships may not be qualified. The
results for the ground state of CO are present as examples. As known,
CO is not a typical ionic system. However, according to Pauling,58,59 it was expressed as a mixture of some resonance Lewis structures,
in which two typical ionic structures were involved 7  

One may wonder if the Rittner-type relationships
work or not. Tests
on this molecule can be made according to two different lines: (1)
treat the molecule as a general molecule using the polarizabilities
of the corresponding ground-state atoms and the observed molecular
dipole moment and (2) treat the molecule as a mixture of two highly
ionic species (the corresponding ionic resonance Lewis structures)
using the related atom’s and cation’s polarizabilities
to estimate the atomic charges for the molecular “mixture”.
For the ground state of CO, the related data from ref (34) are as follows: Re = 1.12823 Å; μd = 0.1098
D; ωe = 2169.81 cm–1; μA = 6.857143 amu; α(C) = 1.76 Å3 and
α(O) = 0.802 Å3. For the lowest states of C+ and O+ cations, α(C+) = 0.942
Å3 and α(O+) = 0.391 Å3, which are calculated at the HF/6-311+G(3df) level, are used to
calculate the atomic charges with eq 5 for the two resonance ionic structures.

On the
basis of the partition ratio given in eq 7 (eq 1 in ref (58)), the atomic charges are |q| ≈
0.4e (suppose the atomic charges are
zero for nonionic resonance structures). According to line 1, the
original Rittner model (eq 2) and the T-Rittner model (eq 4) give |q| = 0.0056e and |q| = 0.0258e, respectively,
using the polarizabilities for atomic carbon and atomic oxygen. The
point charge model gives q = 0.020e; eq 6 gives q = 0.187e. According to line 2, the dipole
moments for  and  can
be estimated to be
0.2745 D based on the assumption that μd () = −μd (). Then, from eq 5, the atomic charge q = 0.0020e is obtained. All the results are not
consistent with the directly predicted value (|q|
≈ 0.4e) based on the mixture of the resonance
Lewis structures. This indicates that the present model is not suitable
for the CO ground state. On the basis of the reference data listed
above, we have 4(αC+αO) = 3.02 and 4(αCαO+) = 2.75; both are greater than Re6 = 2.06, all in units Å6. For general species,
because αB– > αB > 0, it is clear that the condition Re6 ≫ 4(αA+αB–) is NOT hold for both the ionic resonance
structures of CO ground state discussed here.

3 Conclusions
For highly ionic diatomic molecules, the present
improved Rittner
model (eq 5) for both
dipole moments and atomic charges is demonstrated to be self-consistent
with the molecular constants and polarizabilities of related free
cations and free atoms. For alkali halides, the predicted atomic charges
are close to an elementary charge; the predicted dipole moments are
also in excellent agreement with the observed dipole moments. For
spin-restricted highly ionic states, such as the lowest nonet states
of BN, AlN, GaN, etc., the predicted atomic charges are in good agreement
with the NPA and/or AIM charges at MRCI/cc-pvqz and HF/6-311+G(3df)
levels. The predicted atomic charges with such a modified model for
most of the species (except some lithium halides) are also comparable
to the predictions from vibrational frequencies and dipole moments
at equilibrium structures. All the results demonstrate that high-quality
atomic charges can be obtained with experimentally detectable variables.
