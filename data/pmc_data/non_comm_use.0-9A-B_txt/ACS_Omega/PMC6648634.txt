Here, we demonstrate an effective
strategy to constitutionally
increase the conductivity and electrocatalytic property of NiFe2O4 by phosphate ion functionalization. The phosphate-ion-modified
NiFe2O4 (P-NiFe2O4) nanosheets
are readily grown on a carbon cloth by a simple hydrothermal method
and followed by a phosphating process. The introduction of phosphate
ions on the NiFe2O4 surface is highly beneficial
for increasing the charge transport rate and electrocatalytic active
sites. As a result, the as-prepared P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets show outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen
evolution reaction (OER), with a low overpotential (231 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and Tafel slope (49 mV/dec). Furthermore, the P-NiFe2O4 electrode has a remarkable stability with no
activity fading after 50 h. In addition, the as-fabricated water electrocatalysts
exhibit excellent flexibility at the foldable state. These features
make the phosphate-ion-functionalized NiFe2O4 electrodes open a new way to develop OER electrocatalysts with high
electrochemical property.

1 Introduction
To address the global warming issue and fossil energy crisis, water
electrolysis offers an attractive approach to generate hydrogen fuels
as a green and renewable energy.1−3 As one of the most important reactions,
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted extensive research attention
in recent years because of its important role in various hydrogen
production and sunlight-powered water splitting processes.4−6 The major bottleneck for OER is its essentially hysteretic reaction
kinetics, and thus, a high-performance catalyst is used to increase
the reaction rate.7,8 Currently, RuOx and IrOx are the best OER electrocatalysts,
but suffer from high cost and resource scarcity.9,10 Alternatively,
in this context, considerable studies have concentrated on nonprecious
metal-based electrocatalysts for OER,11−16 and some low-cost transition metal (Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, etc.) oxides
were applied to the OER because of their high electroactivity and
stability in alkaline solutions.17−27 Particularly, because of the electron jump between different valence
states of metals in O-sites and additional surface redox-active metal
centers, spinel bimetallic oxides AB2O4 (A,
B = metal) generally exhibited higher electrochemical activity than
the single-metal oxides.28−40 Of various spinels, ferrite NiFe2O4 is one
of the most interesting bimetallic oxides for its attractive advantages,
such as high abundance, low cost, environment friendly, and rich valence
states.12,28,30,41 For instance, the atomically thin NiFe2O4 quantum dots obtained by the template-induced in situ
growth method showed the high OER performance with a low overpotential
(262 mV) and Tafel slope (37 mV/dec).42 Unfortunately, their constitutionally poor conductivity and large
volume expansion during the electrocatalytic reaction process severely
limit their electrocatalytic activity and durability. In addition,
most of the as-fabricated NiFe2O4-based catalysts
are powder, which are liable to aggregation during the reaction processes,
resulting in inferior structure stability and low utilization of catalysts.
In this regard, there is urgent need to design and prepare new NiFe2O4 nanoarchitectures with abundant active sites
and high electrical conductivity for OER.

With all the above
considerations, here, we report an efficient
phosphate ion modulation strategy to boost the catalytic activity
of NiFe2O4 for OER. The phosphate-ion-functionalized
NiFe2O4 nanosheets (P-NiFe2O4) were facilely prepared on a flexible carbon cloth (CC) through
a hydrothermal approach combined with a phosphating process. Such
a flexible conductive structure also provides favorable charge-transfer
pathways and mechanical properties, which allow the catalysts to water
splitting in a complex environment. The functionalization of NiFe2O4 with phosphate ions could significantly promote
the charge-transfer kinetics and make close contact between surface-active
sites and reaction medium, enabling that the P-NiFe2O4 obtained excellent electrocatalytic performance for water
splitting. Additionally, the P-NiFe2O4 exhibited
superior OER catalytic activity with low overpotentials of 231 mV
for a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and maintained its catalytic
activity for 50 h even at the bending state. The flexible foldable
design of the P-NiFe2O4 electrodes has wide
applications to OER electrocatalysts in basic media, which fulfills
the potential future direction of environment-friendly energy storage
and conversion devices.

2 Results and Discussion
The flexible P-NiFe2O4 electrode was obtained
with a two-step process. Typically, free-standing NiFe2O4 nanosheets were grown on CC with a stoichiometric ratio
of Ni/Fe = 1:2 through a facile hydrothermal approach and annealed
at 500 °C in the air atmosphere for 1 h. The characteristic peaks
in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1a) display the dominant phases of NiFe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 03-0875).13 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figure S1 show that the surface of CC is uniformly
covered with a large number of NiFe2O4 nanosheets,
with a thickness of about 20 nm. The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Figure S2a) reveals three distinct lattice fringes of 0.24, 0.25, and 0.48
nm, corresponding to the (222), (311), and (111) planes of NiFe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 03-0875). The selected area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern image (Figure S2b) further confirms the polycrystalline nature of NiFe2O4. It can be seen from the energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis that only Fe, Ni, and O are detected
from these nanosheets (Figure S2c), indicating
that the sample is a highly pure NiFe2O4 phase.

patterns of NiFe2O4 and P-NiFe2O4. (b,c) SEM image of NiFe2O4; (d) TEM,
(e) HRTEM, (f) magnified HRTEM image obtained from e1,
(g) SAED pattern by the circle in e2, and (h–l) element mapping
images of P-NiFe2O4.

To introduce phosphate ions, NiFe2O4 was
annealed at 500 °C for 1 h by placing NaH2PO2·H2O in front in a further nitrogen atmosphere. Interestingly,
observed from Figure 1a, the diffraction peak of XRD became weakened, indicating that the
crystallinity was significantly reduced. SEM images of P-NiFe2O4 (Figure 1b,c) reveal that these nanosheets had apparently collapsed
upon phosphating process. However, these P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets are still uniformly covered on the surface of CC with
a thickness of about 500 nm, which is thicker than that of the original
NiFe2O4. In order to test the specific surface
area of NiFe2O4 and P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets, we performed the N2 sorption experiments
at 77 K by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET; Figure S3). The specific surface area of the
P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets is about 8.41 m2/g, lower than that of the NiFe2O4 nanosheets
(14.48 m2/g). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images of the P-NiFe2O4 (Figure 1d) demonstrate that each nanosheet consists
of numerous different areas with different contrasts. The obvious
contrast variation in the HRTEM image of Figure 1e clearly shows that numerous lattice fringes
are present on the nanosheet. Correspondingly, Figure 1f shows the lattice fringes of 0.25 nm, corresponding
to the (311) planes of NiFe2O4. The SAED pattern
in Figure 1g shows
that the corresponding area (marked by circle in e2) has an amorphous
structure. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1h–l, the scanning TEM–EDXS
element mappings indicates that the Fe, Ni, P, and O elements are
uniformly distributed on the nanosheet. No other impurity was detected
for these nanosheets by the EDXS analysis (Figure S4).

In order to study the chemical composition and binding
modes of
these samples, we further studied Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) of both NiFe2O4 and P-NiFe2O4. As shown in Figure 2a, the Raman characteristic peaks at 493 and 570 cm–1 belong to T2g mode and the bands at 340
and 703 cm–1 are assigned to Eg and A1g modes, respectively, which reveal the presence of NiFe2O4.43 No peaks belonging
to nickel–iron phosphates or nickel iron hydroxide were observed
in Raman spectra, indicating that there was no phase change after
phosphate ion modification. The Fe 2p spectra exhibit the two peaks
at 711.7 and 724.9 eV corresponding to Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2 (Figure 3b), confirming the main valence state of
Fe3+.44 Furthermore, the Ni
3p core level XPS spectra are displayed in Figure S5. NiFe2O4 exhibits two peaks of Ni
located at 855.7 and 873.5 eV, which could be ascribed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the combined
state of Ni2+ in NiFe2O4.45 As for the P-NiFe2O4 sample,
the peaks identified as Fe3+ greatly weaken while the intensity
of Fe2+ peaks increase, suggesting that Fe3+ species are reduced to Fe2+ after the surface phosphating
process. The lower-valence-state Fe characteristics are favorable
for high hardness, fast electron transport, and exposure of more active
sites, which are conducive to improvement of catalytic performance.
Simultaneously, the P-NiFe2O4 still retains
the previous valence state of Ni element (+2) and exhibits two Ni
2p peaks at 856.1 (2p3/2) and 873.9 (2p1/2)
eV. Moreover, XPS survey spectra (Figure S5) indicate that NiFe2O4 contains Ni, Fe, O,
and C elements without other impurities. In the high-resolution XPS
of P 2p spectra, the P-NiFe2O4 exhibits two
characteristic peaks of P 2p centered at 133.5 and 134.5 eV, which
could be ascribed to (H2PO4–) and (PO3–) (Figure 2c). The P 2p core level XPS spectrum of the
P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets further indicate the existence
of (H2PO4–) and (PO3–) species on the P-NiFe2O4 surface.46Figure 2d shows the O 1s XPS spectra of NiFe2O4 and P-NiFe2O4. The NiFe2O4 exhibit one strong peak centered at 530.1 eV
corresponding to the oxygen species (−O−) in NiFe2O4 and a shoulder peak located at 532.1 eV corresponding
to hydroxyl groups (−OH) on the NiFe2O4 surface. Meanwhile, the P-NiFe2O4 sample peaks
can be well convoluted into three parts, centered on 530.5, 531.7,
and 533.1 eV, which can be attributed to the oxygen species of (−O−),
(H2PO4–), and (PO3–).47,48 Markedly, the (−OH) species
on the NiFe2O4 surface have been replaced by
(PO3–) and (H2PO4–) during the surface-functionalized process.

density as a function of scan rate for NiFe2O4 and P-NiFe2O4.

The activity of P-NiFe2O4 for electrochemical
water oxidation was assessed in KOH (1.0 M) aqueous solution. Figure 3a shows the plots
of current density versus potential for the P-NiFe2O4 electrode, along with NiFe2O4, CC and
commercial IrO2 coated on CC (IrO2 loading mass
≈ 0.2 mg/cm2) for comparison. The overpotential
of P-NiFe2O4 was 231 mV at 10 mA/cm2, much lower overpotential than IrO2 (344 mV), CC (498
mV), and NiFe2O4 (300 mV). Furthermore, the
onset potential of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode (∼1.43
V) is also lower than that of the traditional noble metal base electrocatalyst
for OER (IrO2, ∼1.51 V). Figure 3b collects the corresponding Tafel plots.
Likewise, the lowest Tafel slope is observed for P-NiFe2O4 (49 mV/dec), whereas the Tafel slopes for the CC, IrO2, and NiFe2O4 electrodes are 210, 111,
and 130 mV/dec, respectively. All these results confirm that the P-NiFe2O4 electrode reveals the highest OER activity.
More importantly, our P-NiFe2O4 electrode also
presents comparative catalytic performance to other recently reported
noble-metal-free OER catalysts (Table S1), such as FeNi/NiFe2O4@NC (316 mV),49 NiFe2Ox-NPs (286 mV),50 NiO/NiFe2O4 (302 mV),13 Ni3FeN-NPs
(241 mV),51 and CoFe2O4/C (240 mV).52 The Tafel slope of P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets is only ≈49 mV/dec, which
is the smallest compared with other electrodes, and is lower than
those of most electrocatalysts shown in Table S1, indicating the favorable electrocatalytic reaction kinetics
of the P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets. Turnover frequencies
(TOFs) of catalysts were measured for comparison of intrinsic activity.
As revealed, the TOF of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode
is 0.25 × 10–2 s–1 (overpotential
= 300 mV), which is the excellent value reported in previous catalysts.11,28,53

Further information on
electrochemical performance was obtained
by testing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Figure 3c). The charge-transfer resistance
(Rct) of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode (0.37 Ω) is smaller than that of NiFe2O4 (17.5 Ω) and IrO2 (2.8 Ω), indicating
its fast electron transfer of the electrocatalytic reaction process.
The significant reduction of Rct for the
P-NiFe2O4 electrode means that it has faster
OER kinetics, which is considered to be the main reason for its high
OER performance. Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is further
confirmed through capacitance measurements, and the calculated capacitance
of NiFe2O4 and P-NiFe2O4 is 2.5 and 26.5 mF/cm2 (Figures 3d and S6). The
roughness factors of the two samples are approximately 0.5 ×
103 and 5.3 × 103, respectively. It is
clear that the active surface area of P-NiFe2O4 electrode displays more than 10 times larger of the NiFe2O4 electrode. It is noted that the specific surface area
of NiFe2O4 after functionalization was reduced,
but its ECSA significantly increased, revealing that the introduction
of surface phosphate ions can serve as active sites. As a consequence,
the prominent electrocatalytic activity of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode can be ascribed to its faster reaction dynamics,
improved electrical conductivity, and more active sites upon phosphate
ion functionalization.

Besides astringent requirement of high
electrochemical activity,
long-term stability is another important consideration in the selection
of electrocatalysts. As shown in Figure 4a, the stability was tested by chronopotentiometry
method for 50 h. For the P-NiFe2O4 electrode,
in order to achieve the current density of 10 mA/cm2, a
overpotential of ∼230 mV needs to be used, which is substantially
lower than that of the NiFe2O4 (∼330
mV) and CC (>500 mV) electrodes. In addition, the P-NiFe2O4 electrode shows excellent durability in alkaline solution
with an almost constant operating potential for 50 h. In addition,
the long-term OER stability of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode was also evaluated by polarization tests at 20, 50, and
100 mA/cm2 for 50 h (Figure S7), and the results reveal that the overpotentials are still unchanged,
again instruction the high durableness of this P-NiFe2O4 electrode. The polarization curve of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode after durability test also shows inappreciable
differences when compared to the initial data (Figures 4b and S8). Electrolysis
at the fixed current densities was performed sequentially for over
50 h to further highlight the durability of P-NiFe2O4. At the current densities of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mA/cm2 and recovering 10 mA/cm2, the overpotentials remained
stable over each 10 h period at around 235, 280, 303, 350, and 234
mV, respectively (Figure 4c). After 50 h of long-stability test, the linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV) curves were collected as shown in Figure S9. The LSV curves of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode
can be seen from Figure 4c, the before and after 50 h of electrolysis nearly overlapping.

(CP) measurements for long-durability
tests of the CC, NiFe2O4, and P-NiFe2O4 electrodes. (b) Polarization curves of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode after 50 h at 10 mA/cm2. (c) CP measurements for long-stability tests of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode at various current densities.

We also examined the viability
of the as-fabricated P-NiFe2O4 electrode under
complex situations. As shown
in Figure 5a,b, the
LSV curve of the P-NiFe2O4 electrode was detected
under different bending conditions. The good electrocatalytic performance
of P-NiFe2O4 was well maintained under different
deformation states, implying its good flexibility. Thus, our P-NiFe2O4 holds great promise for the application in state-of-the-art
flexible electronics and can adapt to the complex environment of water
splitting.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the use of phosphate-ion-functionalized
NiFe2O4 nanosheets can remarkably boost its
OER performance. Because of enhanced conductivity, quick reaction
dynamics, and increased active sites after phosphate ion functionalization,
the P-NiFe2O4 electrocatalyst yielded high catalytic
activity (overpotential: 231 mV (10 mA/cm2); Tafel slope:
49 mV/dec) and excellent long-term durability toward OER (no activity
fading at 10 mA/cm2 for 50 h). Moreover, the stability
of P-NiFe2O4 was as well remarkable at high
current densities of 50 and 100 mA/cm2 for 50 h. Furthermore,
the as-fabricated P-NiFe2O4 electrocatalyst
exhibited outstanding flexibility at the foldable state. Given the
high electrocatalytic property of the f P-NiFe2O4 electrode, the current encouraging discovery might open up a new
way for low-cost and environment-friendly electrocatalysts of water
splitting.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
of P-NiFe2O4 Nanosheets on CC
The NiFe
layered double hydroxides were
synthesized on CC by a hydrothermal method. First, the CC (3.0 cm
× 2.0 cm) were immersed into an ethanol solution (50 mL), containing
the (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) (1.6 g)
and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.6 g), for
5 min and further heated on a hotplate at 350 °C for another
3 min. Then, the seeded CCs and the resultant precursor solution (20
mL), containing NiSO4·6H2O (0.1314 g),
FeSO4·7H2O (0.2780 g), urea (0.0706 g),
and Na3C6H5O7·2H2O (0.0196 g), were moved to a Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclave. Subsequently, the sealed autoclave was heated to 150 °C
for 12 h. The samples were washed with deionized water several times
and dried. Then, the NiFe2O4 nanosheets were
obtained through annealing in air at 500 °C for 1 h. The substrates
grown with NiFe2O4 nanosheets were placed in
the center of a quartz tube in a chemical vapor deposition furnace
equipped with gas flow controllers. The NiFe2O4 nanosheets were placed on the alumina boats containing NaH2PO2·H2O (0.8 g). The P-NiFe2O4 nanosheets were obtained through annealing CC in a
nitrogen atmosphere at 500 °C for 1 h.

4.2 Material
Characterizations and Electrochemical
Measurements
The sample compositions were measured with XRD
(Rigaku) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw). The surface morphologies
of the materials were studied by SEM (JSM-6330F) and TEM (FEI Tecnai
G2 F30). The valence states of elements of the samples were measured
by XPS (VG ESCALAB 250). The specific surface area was tested by BET
(ASAP 2020M). For the BET measurement, CC substrates covered with
NiFe2O4 and P-NiFe2O4 are
directly used for test.

The electrochemical measurements were
carried out an electrochemistry workstation (CHI 760D). The electrocatalytic
performance of P-NiFe2O4 electrocatalysts was
studied in a three-electrode system in KOH (1.0 M) solution. A Ag/AgCl
(3 M KCl) electrode was used as the reference electrode and a carbon
rod was employed as the counter electrode. The overpotential values
used in this study were calculated according to the following equation:
overpotential (V) = measured value (vs Ag/AgCl) +
0.197 + 0.0591pH – 1.229 [vs reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE)]. For comparisons, the electrocatalytic activities of NiFe2O4 and CC samples were also measured under the
similar conditions. The capacitive current was used to determine the
ECSAs of the P-NiFe2O4 with a scan window of
1.03–1.09 V versus RHE. On the basis of the LSV, the TOF [j(mA/cm2)/(4 × F(96 485C/mol) × m(mg/cm2)/Mmolecular weight)] of the P-NiFe2O4 catalyst can be calculated.
