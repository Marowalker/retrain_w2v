C-rare
earth structure lutetium sesquioxide Lu2O3 has
been recognized as a high-k widegap
insulator with closed shell Lu3+ ions. In this study, rock-salt
structure lutetium monoxide LuO with unusual valence of Lu2+ (4f145d1), previously known as the gaseous
phase, was synthesized as an epitaxial thin film by the pulsed laser
deposition method. In contrast with transparent and highly insulating
Lu2O3, LuO possessed a dark-brown color and
high electrical conductivity concomitant with strong spin–orbit
coupling as a manifestation of Lu 5d electron carriers.

Introduction
Among binary lutetium
oxides, only Lu2O3 is
the stable solid phase with closed shell trivalent Lu ions,1 possessing a strong insulating behavior owing
to its large band gap (5.8 ± 0.1 eV).2−4 On the other
hand, lutetium monoxide LuO has existed only as a gaseous phase5−7 such as various rare earth monoxides with divalent cations (except
EuO) because of its largely positive Gibbs formation energy of the
solid phase.1,8 However, various rock-salt type
rare earth monoxides were recently synthesized in the form of epitaxial
thin films owing to nonequilibrium kinetic growth of the pulsed laser
deposition method. For example, YO is a narrow gap semiconductor,9 SmO is a heavy fermionic metal,10 and LaO is a superconductor.11 In this study, we report the first synthesis of rock-salt type LuO
epitaxial thin films with unusual valence of Lu2+ (Lu2+: [Xe]4f145d1). In stark contrast with
high-k insulator Lu2O3,2−4 LuO exhibited a narrow band gap and high electrical conduction with
a strong spin–orbit interaction originating from its 5d electron
carriers.

Experimental Section
LuO epitaxial thin films were
deposited by the pulsed laser deposition
method. The Lu2O3 polycrystalline pellet sintered
at 1400 °C was used as a target. The thin films were grown at
300 °C on CaF2(001) (a = 5.4630 Å)
substrates using KrF excimer laser (λ = 248
nm) with an energy density of 1.6 J/cm2 and a repetition
ratio of 15 Hz. Ar + 1% O2 mixed gas was supplied during
the deposition to keep oxygen partial pressure PO2 of 6 × 10–10 Torr measured
with a quadrupole mass analyzer. Reflection high energy electron diffraction
during deposition was in situ monitored to confirm the streak pattern
of the thin films. The film surface was in situ capped with an AlOx layer at room temperature to prevent oxidation.The
typical film thickness was approximately 150 nm. From X-ray reflectivity
measurement of a referential sample, thickness of the LuO layer and
the Lu2O3 layer was estimated to be approximately
105 and 40 nm, respectively. The Lu2O3 thin
film on CaF2(001) substrates was also deposited as a reference
for the absorption spectrum and quantitative analysis by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). θ–2θ X-ray diffractions (XRD) and two-dimensional reciprocal space mapping
(RSM) were measured with Cu Kα1 radiation. XPS combined
with Ar+ sputtering was measured using a monochromated
Al Kα source to evaluate ionic valence, where the XPS peak positions
were calibrated by the C 1s peak position (284.8 eV). The absence
of the impurity element was confirmed by XPS (Figure S1). Absorption spectra were obtained from transmittance
and reflectance. Resistivity and the Hall effect under out-of-plane
magnetic field were measured using a Hall bar-shaped sample with 1
mm width and 3 mm length to evaluate carrier density and mobility
from 2 to 300 K.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the θ–2θ XRD
pattern of the LuO thin film. Two peaks at 2θ = 36.952° and 78.943° corresponded to the rock-salt structure
LuO 002 and 004 diffractions, respectively. In addition, cubic Lu2O3 00n peaks were observed as
a result of surface oxidation of LuO similar to the Y2O3 surface layer of the YO thin film,9,12 in
which Lu2O3 002, 006, and 0010 forbidden peaks were generated because of oxygen vacancies. Figure 1b shows a two-dimensional
RSM of the same LuO thin film as that in Figure 1a. Both the LuO thin film and the cubic Lu2O3 layer were fully relaxed and epitaxially grown
on the CaF2 substrate with the epitaxial relationships
of LuO [001]∥CaF2 [001] and Lu2O3 [001]∥CaF2 [001], respectively. The lattice
constants of LuO were a = b = 4.76
Å and c = 4.79 Å (inset of Figure 1b). The ionic radius of Lu2+ in LuO was evaluated to be 0.984 Å from the cube root
of the cell volume. This value is slightly smaller than the ionic
radius of Lu2+ (1.02 Å) calculated from the empirical
formula14 with the Shannon’s ionic
radius of 6-coordinated Lu3+,13 possibly because of the spatially extended 5d orbital in Lu2+ in comparison with the 4f orbital in Lu3+.15

program.23

Figure 2 shows
Lu
4f XPS spectra for LuO and Lu2O3 thin films.
The XPS spectrum of the Lu2O3 thin film was
composed of dominant Lu3+ peaks, small Lu0 peaks,
plasmons peak, and O 2p peak (Figure 2b), in which the Lu0 4f7/2 peak
position (6.5 eV) was consistent with the previous study.16,17 For LuO thin films, the Lu2+ 4f7/2 peak at
8.0 eV was dominant and located between the Lu3+ 4f7/2 peak at 8.3 eV and the Lu0 4f7/2 peak
at 6.5 eV (Figure 2a). The composition was determined to be Lu1O0.90 from the areal intensity ratio of Lu 4d5/2 and O 1s peaks
in the LuO thin film, taking into account the inelastic mean free
paths obtained from the TPP-2M predictive equation (see the Supporting Information).18 The presence of oxygen vacancies in the LuO thin film was consistent
with electron carrier conduction in the LuO thin film as described
below.

(open symbol). Fitting curves (solid curve) and the deconvoluted Lu0 (gray), Lu2+ (red), Lu3+ (blue), the
plasmons (green), and O 2p (yellow) spectra are also shown.

The inset of Figure 3 shows photographs of LuO and
Lu2O3 thin films.
In contrast with the bluish transparent Lu2O3 thin film, the LuO thin film possessed dark-brown color as a result
of its visible light absorption. Figure 3 shows absorption spectra of LuO and Lu2O3 thin films. Lu2O3 showed
sharp absorption edge with negligible in-gap absorption. On the other
hand, the LuO thin film showed a significant and broad visible absorption.
The spectral shape shows remarkable resemblance with that of the YO
thin film9 and those of Yb monochalcogenides
(YbX, X = S, Se, and Te) thin films.19 As indicated in Figure 3, the characteristic absorption energies
could be attributed to Lu 4f → Lu 5d t2g transition
(A), Lu 4f → Lu 5d eg transition (B), O 2p →
Lu 5d t2g transition (D), and O 2p → Lu 5d eg transition superposed with intergap absorption of the Lu2O3 surface oxidation layer (E). A kink at around
4 eV (C) was similar to that in the YO thin film,9 in spite of the unknown origin. The spectral resemblance
between LuO and YO is caused by similar d1 electronic configuration
of Lu2+ with Y2+.

the LuO thin film and the Lu2O3 film. Inset

indices (A–E) are explained in text.

Figure 4a–c
shows temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, the carrier
density, and the mobility for the LuO thin film. The temperature dependence
of conductivity in the LuO thin film showed a metallic behavior (Figure 4a). The carrier polarity
was n-type, probably originated from 5d electrons of Lu2+ and oxygen vacancies serving as an electron donor. The carrier density
and the mobility were insignificantly changed for 2–300 K,
and those at 300 K were 7.4 × 1020 cm–3 and 0.46 cm2/V s, respectively (Figure 4b,c), which were approximately the same as
those of metallic YO thin films.9 The carrier
density was extremely small, assuming fully itinerant 5d electrons
from Lu2+, estimated to be the carrier density of 3.7 ×
1022 cm–3, possibly caused by strong
electron correlation between the 5d electrons. Figure 4d shows temperature dependence of resistivity
for the LuO thin film at 0 and 9 T. The resistivity of the LuO thin
film showed the local minimum at 28 K corresponding to the local maximum
of the carrier density (Figure 4b). The resistivity proportional to −log T below 28 K suggests the appearance of the Kondo effect persisting
up to 9 T, possibly originated from the presence of oxygen vacancies
observed in YO.9Figure 4e shows isothermal magnetoresistance of the
LuO thin film at 2–50 K. The positive magnetoresistance is
thought to be originated from the weak antilocalization effect, indicating
strong spin–orbit coupling of the Lu 5d orbital. The maximum
magnetoresistance at 2 K and 9 T was +2.6%, which was much larger
than that of the YO thin film +0.96%,9 possibly
caused by the larger spin–orbit coupling owing to the heavier
Lu element.20

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized
solid phase rock-salt LuO with unusual
valence Lu2+ in the form of the epitaxial thin film for
the first time. The LuO thin film showed strong visible absorption
and high electrical conduction, in stark contrast with Lu2O3. In addition, the Kondo effect and sizable positive
magnetoresistance were observed. The strong spin–orbit interaction
in this compound would be useful for spintronic electrodes in heterojunctions
like Pt and IrO2.21,22
