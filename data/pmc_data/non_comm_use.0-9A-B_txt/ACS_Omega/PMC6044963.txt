Herein, we describe
the synthesis and application of cross-linked
polystyrene-based dual-function nano- and microparticles containing
both fluorescent tags and metals. Despite containing a single dye,
these particles exhibit a characteristic dual-band fluorescence emission.
Moreover, these particles can be combined with different metal ions
to obtain hybrid metallofluorescent particles. We demonstrate that
these particles are easily nanofected into living cells, allowing
them to be used for effective fingerprinting in multimodal fluorescence-based

the in situ reductions of the metal ions enable other potential uses
of the particles as heterogeneous catalysts.

Introduction
Recent advances in
materials science and nanotechnology have actively
fostered the development of smart nanomaterials capable of tackling
key challenges in nanomedicine, including advanced diagnostics tools,
imaging agents, and therapeutic modalities. The use of varied synthetic
and surface chemistry approaches has enabled the rapid development
of biocompatible particles comprising different materials, such as
polymers, semiconductors, gold, magnetite, and carbon, among many
others, for a variety of applications, for example, from biolabeling
and sensing to targeted drug delivery.1−5 In this context, multimodal nanoparticles (NPs) can be rationally
designed to carry out a myriad of different functions. These multimodal
particles contain components that facilitate their use in different
imaging techniques, such as fluorescence microscopy, magnetic resonance
imaging, and positron emission tomography–computed tomography.5,6 Similarly, particles featuring imaging capabilities for diagnostics
and the ability to carry therapeutic agents have expanded the field
of theranostics.6

Among a wide variety
of imaging techniques available, fluorescence
microscopy methods have become the tools of choice in most biological
labs to study biomolecules and physiological processes at the intracellular
level. These methods provide real-time, in situ, dynamic information
of these processes in a simple and minimally invasive manner. Under
these conditions, fluorescence detection platforms based on NPs can
achieve enhanced sensitivity, stability, and biological compatibility
compared with other traditional approaches.2,7 For
instance, very bright entities can be obtained by encapsulating organic
fluorophores into particle matrices or by covalently attaching multiple
fluorophores onto particles. Because particles can be decorated with
thousands of units of a particular dye, issues such as photobleaching
are minimized. This improves particle stability and facilitates intricate
experiments, such as single-particle tracking.8

Additional applications of fluorescent NPs beyond live cell
imaging
include foreign gene expression at the single cell level (e.g., DNA-functionalized
NPs) and fluorescence-based flow cytometry (e.g., fluorescence-activated
cell sorting, FACS). To this end, the local nanofection of cells with
targeted NPs enables the tracking and barcoding of cells in FACS experiments.9

Although these features make fluorescent
NPs very attractive tools
for cell biology, they still present a few drawbacks. One disadvantage
is that the number of simultaneous parameters that can be studied
in FACS experiments is frequently limited because of the spectral
characteristics of the fluorescent dyes and the limited excitation
and detection capabilities of available instruments. Another issue
that has not been extensively studied is the physicochemical interactions
between solid-supported fluorophores and polymeric chains of NPs.
These interactions can lead to unique fluorescence profiles different
than those of free fluorophores in solution, giving rise to unexpected
cross-talk channel interactions.

Recently, our capacity to perform
complex multiplexing studies
was expanded by combining flow cytometry with precise mass spectrometry
detection using metal atoms as markers instead of fluorophores. This
novel mass cytometry technique (termed cytometry by time of flight,
CyToF) can simultaneously analyze up to 40 different cell parameters
through the use of several metal atoms and isotopes.10,11 However, the manifestation of unexpected spectral properties resulting
from interactions between the structural components of solid supports
and conjugated dye units has not been comprehensively investigated.

We aimed to study fluorophore–polymer interactions to better
understand unexpected fluorescence profiles found in Cy5-functionalized
polystyrene NPs. This study allowed us to develop a new type of multimodal
cell-penetrating NPs that simultaneously carry a well-established
red fluorophore and metal ions for the multiplex tagging of live cells.
These novel NPs can be used simultaneously in FACS and CyToF as a
new and versatile method for cell barcoding.

Results and Discussion
Fluorescent,
Dual-Band-Emitting Particles
We synthesized
cross-linked polystyrene nano- and microparticles (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) conjugated with the sulfo-Cy5
dye (Table 1, entries
2 to 9, and Scheme S1), a member of the
cyanine family, for use in fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry
applications. Remarkably, fluorescence analyses of the resulting NPs
showed two distinctive emission bands under the same excitation wavelength:
the characteristic red fluorescence emission band of the Cy5 dye and
an unexpected band within the green range of the spectrum. The dual-band
behavior of these particles was confirmed using different techniques:
fluorescence confocal microscopy, dual-color fluorescence lifetime
imaging microscopy (FLIM) with spectrographic capabilities (Figure S2), and FACS flow cytometry. FLIM images
of Cy5-PEG-NP500 clearly showed
fluorescence emission from the particles in both green and red channels
when excited at 470 nm (Figure 1A). The ratio of fluorescence intensities between the green
and red channels (IG/IR) was 0.5 ± 0.1, averaged over different images
with several particles. We also reconstructed IG/IR images to identify particles
exhibiting high green fluorescence (Figure 1B). Emission spectra obtained directly from
some of the particles found in the image field of view also showed
the dual-band behavior with two maxima, one centered at approximately
670 nm (characteristic of free Cy5) and a second band centered at
approximately 530 nm (Figure 1C). These particles were also analyzed using an FACS instrument
at excitations of 488 and 633 nm. Events (particles) were recorded
in the red allophycocyanin (APC) and green fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) channels. Plotting these events in a fluorescence correlogram
showed that the green and red channel events were proportionally correlated
(Figure 1D). To confirm
that the green fluorescence signal did not originate from other components
of the particles, unlabeled particles, that is, NH2-PEG-NP500, were prepared using the same protocol (except for the Cy5 conjugation).
FLIM analysis showed no detectable fluorescence from the NPs, whereas
FACS analysis showed events only in the random noise quadrant (Figure S3).

a All NPs were covalently
bound to
their cargo through amide bonds. PEG = 1-amino-4,7,10-trioxa-13-tridecanamine
succinamyl.

To expand the
applicability of our particles, we substituted the
polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer with a lysine unit, which enabled
the production of bivalent particles featuring a first arm that could
be conjugated to other polypeptides or proteins, such as streptavidin
through its Nα amino group, and a second arm that could be conjugated
to sulfo-Cy5 dyes through its Nε amino group. Thus, in these
particles, that is, Fmoc-Lys(Cy5)-NP500, Fmoc-Lys(Cy5)-NP900,
and Strp-Lys(Cy5)-NP1200, the
Cy5 units were conjugated to the lysine side chains without PEG spacers
(Schemes S2 and S3). These particles also
exhibited the dual-band green/red emission behavior (Figure S4), thereby confirming that PEG molecules were not
involved in the generation of the green fluorescent band. Notably,
this effect was less prominent for larger particles. This can be attributed
to the lower density of the polymer network in the larger particles,
which minimized the interactions that cause the green fluorescence.
Therefore, particle size is an important factor in controlling the
dual-band emission of Cy5-labeled particles.

On the basis of
these results, we first hypothesized that dye aggregation
could account for the altered spectral features. Indeed, H- and J-aggregation
of cyanine dyes are known to cause changes in their spectroscopic
properties by altering their topological arrangements; furthermore,
aggregation can be driven by high dye concentrations. Aggregation
can also be fostered by certain templating structures. For example,
H- and J-aggregates of cyanine dyes have been detected in the major
and minor grooves of double-stranded DNA,12 in NPs,13 and in other structures. To
test this hypothesis, we synthesized a set of Cy5-PEG-NP500 particles with different loadings of
Cy5. The concentration of the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, the
activated acid form of the dye in the reaction, ranged from 1.3 ×
10–4 to 1.3 × 10–7 M. FACS
experiments clearly showed that when the concentration of the dye
in the reaction chamber was 1.3 × 10–6 M or
lower, the emission in the green channel decreased to noise levels
(Figure S5). The percentage of detected
events showing notable green fluorescence decreased from 94% at the
highest concentration of fluorophore to 5% at the lowest concentration.
However, additional effects can be seen in the FACS results. A decrease
in the concentration of the red dye by 1 order of magnitude caused
a notable decrease in the red emission. However, the green emission
did not decrease by the same factor and was more persistent. This
effect resulted in an increased ratio of green fluorescence to red
fluorescence at lower dye loadings. We further investigated this effect
in dual-channel fluorescence confocal microscopy experiments. The
results showed the same trend in the IG/IR ratio, that is, an increased ratio
with decreased dye loading (Figure S6).
Thus, the hypothesis of dye aggregation independently causing green
emission was disproved. In such a case, a reduction of the green emission
with respect to that of the red emission was expected as the dye concentration
decreased. Therefore, we considered the possibility of an intermolecular
interaction between the Cy5 moiety and the NP components. The close
proximity of the cyanine dye aromatic rings and conjugated system
(alternating double bonds) to the polystyrene aromatic groups was
considered to promote π–π stacking interactions,
causing a charge transfer that would result in the green emissive
transition. Figure S7 in the Supporting Information shows the aromatic interactions that could cause the green fluorescence
emission. Additional insights into this model is described in the
next section.

An additional effect that may be behind the different
trends in
the relative emissions in the green and the red spectral regions is
the presence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from
the green emission emitters (i.e., the donors) to the red dyes (i.e.,
the acceptors; Figure S7). The FRET process
would result in a lower green fluorescence when high loadings of the
acceptor Cy5 dye are present. This energy transfer explains why a
decrease in the number of acceptors resulted in an apparent increase
in green emission. Experimental proof for the presence of FRET was
obtained by investigating the average fluorescence lifetime, τ,
profiles of the red-emitting dyes in the particles using FLIM microscopy.
To test the potential energy transfer from green emission emitters
to the red dyes, we employed a 470 nm excitation laser and collected
FLIM images in the red channel (Figure S2). For small particles carrying Cy5 with short linkers, such as Cy5-PEG-NP500 (Figure 1A) and Cy5-PEG2-NP500, the Cy5 τ
value was surprisingly longer than that of the dye in solution (1.0
ns).14 For Cy5-PEG-NP500, the average τ value was 2.3 ns, and
for Cy5-PEG2-NP500, it was 1.9 ns (Figure 2A,B, respectively). This enhancement in the
fluorescence lifetime correlated with the appearance of the green
fluorescence emission. Interestingly, as the linker was lengthened,
the fluorescence lifetime decreased. Similarly, for larger particles,
the green emission was considerably reduced, and the fluorescence
lifetime of Cy5 approached that of the dye in solution. For example,
the average τ values of Cy5 in Fmoc-Lys(Cy5)-NP900 and Strp-Lys(Cy5)-NP1200 were 1.4 and 1.2 ns, respectively (Figure 2C,D), similar to
those of the dye in solution. This behavior was primarily due to the
energy transfer from the green-emitting donors to the Cy5 red fluorophores,
acting as acceptors. Indeed, spectral analyses showed a clear overlap
between the green emission of the aggregates in the absorption region
of free Cy5 (Figures 1 and S8). This overlap may have fostered
FRET between the two fluorescent forms. FRET resulted in an increased
fluorescence lifetime of the acceptor dye, that is, Cy5, because the
excitation source of the dye was not a direct laser pulse but the
donor species. Thus, the fluorescence decay of the acceptor was a
convolution of its natural decay law with that of the donor.15 Therefore, when the acceptor was at larger distances
or when there was a lower surface loading of the acceptor in large
particles, the FRET process was impeded, and the dye fluorescence
value returned to its unaffected state.

particles. The pseudocolor scale indicates the average fluorescence
lifetime in each pixel. The scale bars represent 2.5 μm. (A) Cy5-PEG-NP500; (B) Cy5-PEG2-NP500; (C) Fmoc-Lys(Cy5)-NP900; (D) Strp-Lys(Cy5)-NP1200; (E) A647-PEG-NP500; (F) Fmoc-Lys(A647)-NP900; (G) Fmoc-Lys(A647)-NP2500; and (H) Fmoc-Lys(A647)-NP5000.

We then investigated
whether the unexpected green fluorescence
emission observed was specific to the Cy5 dye. We synthesized particles
according to the same protocol (see the Supporting Information and Scheme S4), except
that the Cy5 dye was substituted with another red fluorophore, Atto
647N (A647). A647 is spectrally equivalent to Cy5 (Figure S8) but has a different chemical structure. Cy5 is
a carbocyanine dye, whereas A647 is a carbopyronin dye.16 Dual-channel FLIM and FACS studies of A647-loaded
NPs showed negligible green fluorescence emission (Figure S9), exhibiting IG/IR values generally below 0.1 (Figure S10). Similar to previous experiments, we prepared
particles using different loadings of the A647 dye. FACS measurements
showed that the number of events exhibiting green fluorescence was
always lower than 10% (Figure S11). Thus,
we confirmed that the unexpected green fluorescence and the dual-band
behavior of the particles were specific effects of the chemical structure
of the Cy5 dye and likely due to stacking interactions between the
dye and the aromatic-rich network of the particle (Figure S7). Moreover, we confirmed that this effect was not
related to any factor in the synthesis of the conjugates.

FLIM
imaging also showed opposite behaviors in the Cy5- and A647-loaded
particles. The fluorescence lifetime τ of the A647 dye in the
NPs remarkably varied from one particle to another but followed a
different trend. In small particles (A647-PEG-NP500), the average τ value was 1.3 ns (Figure 2E), which was much
shorter than the reported value of τ of the dye in solution
(3.5 ns),17 providing evidence for a quenching
process. In large particles carrying polypeptide chains, the A647
lifetime indicated a quenching behavior; the quenching effect reduced
as the size of the particles increased. The average τ value
was 1.8 ns in Fmoc-Lys(A647)-NP900 (Figure 2F) and 2.8
ns in Fmoc-Lys(A647)-NP2500 (Figure 2G). For Fmoc-Lys(A647)-NP5000 (Figure 2H), the average lifetime of the dye of 3.7 ns was close
to that of the free dye in solution. This quenching effect was likely
related to a homo-FRET process between different moieties of the dye
on the NPs that were brought close together. The homomolecular energy
transfer was facilitated by the spectral overlap between the emission
and absorption of the dye (Figure S8).
As the interdye distance lengthened due to increased particle area,
the homo-FRET quenching was reduced. This showed the valuable information
that FLIM provides to probe the environment of the dyes used in fluorescence
microscopy.18

Metallofluorescent Particles
for Flow Cytometry and Catalysis
The next step was to construct
metallofluorescent particles to
produce multimodal particles for fingerprinting in fluorescence-based
and mass spectrometry-based approaches. Palladium polystyrene NPs
have been previously prepared by coordinating palladium ions with
free amino groups and aromatic rings of polymer networks.19 Herein, we exploited the conjugated polymethine
chain of the Cy5 dye to create, with the polystyrene aromatic rings,
an electron-rich network to coordinate metal ions. Cy5-PEG-NP500 was mixed with Pd(OAc)2, and
after 24 h of incubation, excess metal ions were washed away, leaving
only metal ions that had been effectively coordinated with the particles,
thereby yielding Pd(II)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 (Scheme S5). An in situ reduction
of the Pd2+ ions to Pd(0) via hydrazine treatment (Schemes 1 and S6)20 was employed
to obtain Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500.

Scheme 1 Reduction Reaction To Prepare Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500
The metallofluorescent NPs were then analyzed by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(EDX–HRTEM) (Figures 3, S13, and S14). Both sets of particles, Pd(II)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 and Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500, clearly presented Pd(II) and Pd(0),
respectively, in the structure. The presence of the metal was evident
when compared with the EDX–HRTEM results of the control Cy5-PEG-NP500 particles (Figure S12). An additional test to prove the
effective reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0) within the NPs was performed
by probing the catalytic activity of these particles, using a well-known
reaction catalyzed by Pd(0), that is, removing allyloxycarbonyl protecting
groups.20,21 We used a fluorogenic version of this reaction,
wherein the nonfluorescent bis-allyloxycarbonyl rhodamine was transformed
into fluorescent rhodamine 110 once the protecting groups were removed
(Scheme S9). The Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 particles were capable of catalyzing
the fluorogenic reaction (Figure 3G) to an even larger extent than the Pd microspheres
used as controls.20 This improved catalytic
activity can be explained by the fact that Pd(0) nanoclusters were
found within the NPs (Figures 3F and S14), thereby exhibiting
a larger specific area than the Pd(0) microspheres. By contrast, Pd(II)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 and Cy5-PEG-NP500, that is, particles carrying the Pd2+ cation and particles not carrying any metal at all, respectively,
were not capable of facilitating the removal of the allyloxycarbonyl
groups.

blank control NH2-PEG-NP500 (red) particles.

As another control, H2N-NP500 and Ac-HN-NP500 (Table S1 and Schemes S7 and S8) were used to confirm if the
electron-rich polymethine chain played a role in coordinating Pd ions.
The H2N-NP500 and Ac-HN-NP500 particles possessed glycine spacers, but the former presented an
electron-rich environment due to the free amino groups, whereas the
latter presented aromatic rings as electron-rich groups because they
contained amide groups rather than free amines. These particles were
treated with Pd(OAc)2, following the same protocol as that
described for fabricating Pd(II)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 and Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500. All sets of particles, with and without Cy5, were characterized
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure S15). The XPS spectra showed that Ac-HN-NP500 contained lower levels of Pd(II) and traces
of Pd(0), whereas the treated H2N-NP500 contained similar levels
of Pd(II) and Pd(0) compared with Pd(II)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 (Figures 3A and S15) and Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 (Figures 3D and S15), respectively.
This indicated that polystyrene rings were not sufficient to strongly
coordinate Pd ions and require additional electron-rich functional
groups to enhance coordination of Pd species to NPs. Polymethine groups
of the Cy5 dye coupled to polystyrene NPs offered an optimal environment
to coordinate metals such as Pd.

Interestingly, the coordination
of Pd2+ ions in the
electron-rich network of the conjugated double bonds of the cyanine
dye and the polystyrene rings was found to have an effect on the green
fluorescence emission caused by the direct interaction between these
moieties of the NPs. Indeed, FACS experiments showed that the green
fluorescence emission was completely removed upon coordination of
Pd2+ ions (Figures 3H and 4), supporting the proposed model
for the π–π-stacking interaction causing the green
emission (Figure S7) and the model for
the coordination of Pd2+ (Figure 5A). Moreover, the reduction of Pd2+ to Pd(0) in the Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 particles did not considerably change the fluorescent properties
of the particle (Figures 3H and 4), confirming that the reduction
did not alter the spatial arrangement of the metal (Figure 5A). Two others metal ions,
Ni2+ and Cu+, were also used to produce more
metallofluorescent NPs following the same approach. A dim quenching
effect of the Cy5 fluorescence in the red channel was observed by
FACS for all metal particles (Figure S16). Most importantly, the presence of these metal ions caused the
fluorescence emission in the green channel to mostly disappear when
analyzed by FACS, suggesting a similar coordination mechanism as that
of Pd2+ ions.

bonds.

To provide further insights into
the role of the polymethine chain
in the interactions behind the manifestation of green fluorescence
from red-emitting dyes, we studied whether the interruption of the
electronic conjugation of the system could affect the fluorescent
properties of the NPs. To this end, we tested the effect of gold ions
(HAuCl4·3H2O) over the Cy5 fluorophore.
Au(III) ions are capable of catalyzing addition reactions to alkenes.22 We found that Au(III) ions catalyzed the breakage
of the polymethine chain conjugation in Cy5, as evidenced by an immediate
color loss from blue to transparent, when Au(III) was added to an
aqueous solution of the dye. This color loss was supported by the
total disappearance of the typical Cy5 absorption spectrum, after
treatment with Au(III) (Figure S17). With
these properties in mind, we treated Cy5-PEG-NP500 particles with HAuCl4·3H2O. Following treatment, NPs were washed and analyzed by FACS and
XPS. Remarkably, the FACS analysis showed the disappearance of the
red fluorescence signal, whereas the green fluorescence signal remained
unmodified compared with untreated Cy5-PEG-NP500 (Figure 4). XPS analyses of these particles showed traces of gold.
This indicated that the disappearance of red fluorescence was not
due to metal quenching but due to gold catalyzing addition reactions
to the conjugated double bonds of the Cy5 dye, thereby breaking the
electronic conjugation of the polymethine chain (Figure 5B). However, green fluorescence
signals were unaltered, suggesting that this signal comes from aromatic
interactions between the heterocyclic moieties of the dye and polystyrene
chains without intervention from the polymethine chain (Figure 5B). With these experiments,
we clearly identified the source of the double-band fluorescence emission
behavior in Cy5-loaded NPs.

We previously reported the versatility
of cross-linked polystyrene-based
nano-/microparticles for the nanofection of a plethora of cell lines
and primary cultures.9,20,23 To prove the feasibility of using these novel metallofluorescent
NPs to nanofect mammalian cells in live cell cultures, breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-231 was used. Cells were incubated with these particles
for up to 6 days before measuring cell viability. Cells nanofected
with metallofluorescent particles presented viability similar to those
nanofected with the control, NH2-PEG-NP500, even at high NP
loadings (Figure 6A).
This indicated that the metal ions did not leach out in the cells.
The efficient uptake of the metallofluorescent NPs was also confirmed
by FACS analysis. As shown in Figure 6B, a greater number of NPs employed during nanofection
resulted in a higher percentage of cells containing the metallofluorescent
NPs. The multiplicity of nanofection 50 (MNF50) values24 of the different metallofluorescent particles
was the same order of magnitude as that of the control Cy5-PEG-NP500 (Figure 6B).

To validate the multimodal applications of the metallofluorescent
NPs and confirm that these particles transported metals into cells, Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 was used at different
concentrations. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500, split into two aliquots, and analyzed
using flow cytometry and CyToF. For cells analyzed using CyToF, a
DNA marker labeled with iridium was used to record instances, when
both iridium (cell nuclei marker) and palladium (present in NPs) were
present in the nanofected cells as a positive event (Figures 6C and S18). CyToF dot plots confirmed that cells were nanofected
with particles carrying Pd(0) without any evident toxic effects. Moreover,
a comparison of the percentages of nanofected cells (Figure 6D) showed no differences between
the values from flow cytometry detection and those from CyToF detection.
These results confirmed that Pd(0)-Cy5-PEG-NP500 was a suitable dual marker for flow cytometry and
CyToF in living cells and did not negatively affect the cell growth.
Moreover, an NP size of 500 nm guaranteed cellular uptake and the
complete burning and ionization of the beads in the inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) torch for CyToF. As shown in Figures 6E and S19, these
particles were detectable by confocal microscopy, enabling localization
or colocalization studies and the direct counting of NPs in a cell
(Figure S20). The practical combination
of red-emitting particles with different metals served to provide
different fingerprinting options for CyToF applications, facilitating
cell barcoding for cell-based multiplexing assays.

Conclusions
The synthesis and characterization of multimodal particles featuring
fluorophores and metals were reported. We validated the use of these
particles as cell trackers detectable by fluorescence microscopy,
CyToF, and FACS. The Cy5-labeled particles presented characteristic
dual-band emission, in which the fluorescence originated exclusively
from a single dye in two different states. This characteristic emission
profile may be considered a fingerprint of our particles for FACS
and fluorescence microscopy experiments. The particles carrying both
Cy5 and metal cations enabled multiplex fingerprinting and cell barcoding
using tandem FACS and CyToF. Finally, the possibility of reducing
Pd2+ ions to Pd(0) in situ provides new possibilities for
multimodal particles, such as carrying a red fluorophore for fluorescence
applications while acting as in situ catalysts for Pd chemistry.

Experimental
Section
Multimodal, Red-Emitting Particles and Metallofluorescent NPs
We prepared an extensive series of modified particles, including
red-emitting fluorophores, such as sulfo-Cy5 or A647. The fluorophores
were attached to the particles via PEG spacers of different lengths
or via spacers suitable for secondary modifications, including those
featuring either Fmoc-protected amino acids or streptavidin. Additionally,
different metallofluorescent particles containing the red fluorophore
sulfo-Cy5 and different metal isotopes were prepared by exploiting
the chelating properties of π bonds in the dye and PEG units
to the metals. Tables 1 and S1 summarize the nomenclature and
design of the particles prepared in this work. The initial 500, 900,
and 1200 nm aminomethyl cross-linked polystyrene NPs (Figure S1) were synthesized according to our
established protocols.9 Then, different
reactions allowed the incorporation of the fluorescent dyes and other
modifications. Further details on the synthetic steps of all particle
structures developed in this work can be found in the Supporting Information (Schemes S1–S8).

General Method for Metallofluorescent Particle Loading
All
chemical reactions were performed over dried NPs. When the reactions
were finished, the NPs were washed three times using suspension–centrifugation
cycles. The 500, 900, and 1200 nm aminomethyl cross-linked polystyrene
NPs were functionalized with chemical spacers, such as Fmoc-protected
PEG and Fmoc-lysine-Dde(OH), using oxyma and N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), at 60 °C for
2 h. Subsequent Fmoc and Dde removal was performed using a 20% piperidine
solution in dimethylformamide (DMF) and using a mixture of hydroxylamine
hydrochloride/imidazole in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone/DMF.25 The fluorophore conjugation step was carried
out using a sulfo-Cy5 NHS ester solution in DMF with N,N-diisopropylethylamine at room temperature for
14 h. Afterward, the fluorescent NPs were mixed with a palladium diacetate
(Pd(OAc)2) solution in DMF and were stirred at room temperature
for 14 h. To generate the in situ reduction of Pd2+ into
Pd0, the Pd2+ metallofluorescent NPs were mixed
with a 10% hydrazine solution in methanol at room temperature for
30 min.20,21 Finally, to obtain streptavidin-conjugated
NPs, the fluorescent NPs were functionalized with a 25% glutaraldehyde
solution in H2O and a streptavidin solution in phosphate
buffer saline (PBS), at room temperature for 14 h. Subsequently, the
NPs were mixed with a NaBH3CN solution in PBS/EtOH (3:1)
and washed with ethanolamine in bovine serum albumin solution in PBS.

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) and Spectroscopy
A MicroTime 200 (PicoQuant GmbH, Germany) was used to collect FLIM
images in two different detection channels, green and red, after a
470 nm pulsed excitation. The system was equipped with an Andor Shamrock
303i-A spectrograph and an ultrasensitive Andor Newton electron multiplying
CCD camera to simultaneously collect the entire fluorescence emission
spectrum from different points of the images. Further instrumental
details can be found in the Supporting Information and Figure S2.

Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy
A Leica DMi8 confocal
microscope was used for dual-color fluorescence imaging, equipped
with a Lumencore solid-state white light source, a PL Apo CS2 oil
immersion objective (63×, 1.4 NA), and an Andor Zyla CSMOS camera
for imaging. The green channel was collected with a 480/40 nm excitation
bandpass filter, a 505 nm dichroic mirror, and a 527/30 nm emission
bandpass filter, whereas the red channel was obtained using a 620/60
nm bandpass filter for the excitation, a 660 nm dichroic mirror, and
a 700/75 nm bandpass emission filter.

Fluorescence-Activated
Cell Sorting (FACS)
The fluorescence
emission of the particles carrying red dyes (either Cy5 or A647) was
assessed using flow cytometry analysis with BD FACSCanto II (Becton
Dickinson & Co., NJ, USA) equipped with a solid-state Coherent
Sapphire blue laser refrigerated by air (488 nm and 20 mW power),
a JDS uniphase HeNe red laser (633 nm and 17 mW), and eight detectors
(six fluorescence detectors and two morphologic parameters). The red
emission fluorescence was detected in the APC channel (660/20 nm).
Unexpected “green emission” was measured using the FITC
channel (530/30 nm).

Mass Cytometry
Mass cytometry analysis
was performed
using Helios CyTOF2 (DVS Sciences, Fluidigm Co., CA, USA). This instrument
used an ICP time-of-flight mass spectrometer to detect a mass range
of 75–209 amu in 135 different channels at an average event
rate of 500 events/s, a highest rate of 2000 events/s, and a sensitivity
of 0.3% for 159Tb.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The presence of palladium
was determined by monitoring the profile of Pd 3d photoemission. XPS
spectra were obtained using a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer equipped with an Al monochromatic X-ray source, over
powdered nanoparticle samples. General spectra were obtained with
a pass energy of 160 eV, the X-ray source was operated at 75 W, the
high-resolution spectra were obtained with a pass energy of 20 eV,
and the X-ray source was operated at 225 W.

High-Resolution Transmission
Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and
Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Analyses
Transmission electron
microscopy experiments were carried out using an ultrahigh-resolution
FEI Titan G2 microscope with an XFEG field emission gun operating
at 300 kV. The microscope was fitted with a high-angle annular dark
field (HAADF) detector to operate in scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) mode and with an FEI microanalysis system for EDX.
The microscope reached maximum resolutions of 0.8 Å in the TEM
mode and 2 Å in the STEM mode. To analyze samples, the NPs were
suspended in absolute ethanol and supported on ultra-thin carbon 200
mesh Cu grids.
