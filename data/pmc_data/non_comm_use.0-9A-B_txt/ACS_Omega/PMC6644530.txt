Diacylglycerides
(DAGs) constitute an important category of lipids
owing to their ability to form a lipid membrane, which can be used
in a wide variety of biomedical applications. DAGs often include a
zwitterionic polar headgroup that can influence the properties of
the lipid membrane (e.g., protein adsorption, ion binding, hydration,
membrane fluidity, phase stability) and affect their applicability.
To clarify the effect of the charge arrangement of zwitterionic headgroups
on intermolecular interactions in the DAG bilayers, we investigated
the intermolecular interaction between a naturally occurring DAG (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)) and synthetic DAGs (which
is called “inverse charge zwitterlipids (ICZLs)”) whose
headgroup charges were antiparallel with respect to those of DPPC.
We used 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-carboxybetaine
(DPCB) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-sulfobetaine
(DPSB) as ICZLs and compared two combinations of the lipids (DPPC–DPCB
and DPPC–DPSB). We obtained surface pressure–area (π–A) isotherms to elucidate the intermolecular interaction
between the lipids in the monolayer at the air/water interface. We
found shrinkage of the area per molecule in both lipid combinations,
indicating that mixing DPPC with ICZLs results in an attractive intermolecular
force. As an overall trend, the degree of shrinkage of the mixed monolayer
and the thermodynamic favorability of mixing were greater in the DPPC–DPCB
combination than in the DPPC–DPSB combination. These trends
were also observed in the lipid bilayers, as determined from the gel-to-liquid
crystal phase transition temperature (Tc) of the aqueous dispersion of the lipid vesicles. In the highly
compressed lipid monolayers and vesicles (lipid bilayer), the molar
fractions of ICZLs, in which the intermolecular interaction reached
a maximum, were 0.6–0.8 for the DPPC–DPCB combination
and 0.5 (equimolar composition) for the DPPC–DPSB combination.
Therefore, in the compressed monolayers and bilayers, the mechanism
of intermolecular interaction between DPPC and DPCB is different from
that between DPPC and DPSB.

Introduction
Lipids are important chemicals that can
assemble in layers to form
an interface. In particular, diacylglycerides (DAGs), which have one
hydrophilic headgroup and two hydrophobic tailgroups, constitute an
important category of lipids because they are the main components
of naturally occurring biological membranes. The tailgroups of DAGs
endow them with sufficient hydrophobicity to form a stable monolayer
at the air/water interface. In an aqueous dispersion, DAGs assemble
to lipid bilayers in the form of spherical vesicles or planar lamellae owing to
the appropriate size balance between the hydrophilic headgroup and
the hydrophobic tailgroups. Such bilayers of DAGs have many potential
applications in biomedicine. For instance, the spherical vesicle structure
has often been used to provide drug delivery vehicles.1−4 The flat lipid bilayer can be used as the interface of biosensors,5−7 the scaffolds for membrane-bound proteins,8,9 the
surface modifier of microfluidic devices,5,10 etc.

We focused on phosphatidylcholines, which are naturally occurring
DAGs, because they are the main component of biological membranes
such as those of cells and microorganisms in the cytosol. Figure 1 depicts the chemical
structure of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DPPC). The polar headgroup of phosphatidylcholine is phosphocholine
(−PO4––CH2CH2–N+(CH3)3), which
has a large dipole moment because it is a zwitterionic group comprising
a cationic choline moiety and an anionic phosphate ester. In contrast
to naturally occurring lipids, DAGs with headgroup charges that are
antiparallel to those of phosphatidylcholine have been synthesized
recently by Szoka et al.11−15 and by our group.16 Such DAGs were named
“inverse charge zwitterlipids (ICZLs)” on the basis
of the arrangement of their headgroup charges. In a previous report,
we demonstrated that 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-sulfobetaine
(DPSB) attractively interacts with DPPC.17 The results clearly demonstrated that the antiparallel headgroup
charges in these two DAGs contribute to the attractive interaction
between the lipids. This is an important finding that suggests that
a pair of antiparallel zwitterionic headgroups can modulate the physical
properties of DAG bilayers.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) and an inverse charge zwitterlipid (ICZL) and hypothesized
intermolecular interaction between these lipids. The ICZLs used in
this study had either carboxybetaine (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-carboxybetaine (DPCB)) or sulfobetaine (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-sulfobetaine (DPSB)) headgroups.

The interaction between the zwitterionic headgroups
of DAG bilayers
is important for the following two reasons. First, in an aqueous environment,
the headgroups of DAGs are located at the lipid layer/water interface
and coexist with water-soluble substances that potentially associate
with the headgroups, determining factors that affect their biomedical
applicability (e.g., protein adsorption,18−20 ion binding,21−23 the structure of hydration water24−26). Second, the interaction
between the headgroups of DAGs significantly influences the physical
properties of their bilayer form.27−29 This affects the fluidity
of the lipid layer and determines which self-assembled structures
are stable under particular conditions. These two aspects are closely
related to the application of lipid materials in biomedicine. Therefore,
any study of the interaction between the zwitterions should provide
significant insight for the design of zwitterionic biointerfaces.
Furthermore, the authors of many reports have described the interaction
between zwitterionic materials and external substances (e.g., proteins,30−32 electrolytes,32,33 or hydration water32−34). However, there have been relatively few studies on the interaction
between zwitterionic moieties themselves,35−38 and there is scope for research
in this area.

We used two pairs of lipid combinations, DPPC–1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-carboxybetaine (DPCB) and DPPC–DPSB,
to further examine the interaction between zwitterionic headgroups
with charges arranged antiparallel to each other in the DAGs. The
chemical structures of these DAGs are shown in Figure 1. The intermolecular interaction between
DPPC and ICZLs was investigated by obtaining the surface pressure–area
(π–A) isotherm of the mixed lipid monolayer
at the air/water interface. Furthermore, we investigated the thermotropic
phase transition (gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition) of lipid
vesicles composed of DPPC and ICZLs because the transition temperature
reflects the intermolecular interaction of lipids.

Results and Discussion
π–A Isotherms of the Lipid Mixture
Monolayer
To examine the intermolecular interaction between
DPPC and ICZLs, we acquired surface pressure–area (π–A) isotherms of the binary lipid monolayer at the air/water
interface (Figure 2a). Because the lipids used in this study differed only in their
headgroups (Figure 1), any modulation of the intermolecular interaction between the two
molecules must have involved those headgroups. As an overall trend,
the isotherms for the mixed monolayers comprising DPPC–DPCB
or DPPC–DPSB were shifted to lower area. This result indicates
that attractive interaction occurred between the lipids in both combinations.
As discussed later, complexed intermolecular interactions that must
have occurred between the headgroups (PC–SB and PC–CB)
may have been involved in the attractive interaction between the lipids
in the binary monolayer. The maximum surface pressure of the lipid
monolayer comprising DPPC and DPCB ranged from 50 to 60 mN/m at a
given molar fraction of DPCB, which was markedly higher than that
of the monolayer comprising the DPPC–DPSB combination (40–50
mN/m). This result indicates that a more stable monolayer was formed
from the DPPC–DPCB lipid combination than from the DPPC–DPSB
combination.

Figure 2 Surface pressure–area (π–A) isotherms of lipid monolayers of DPPC in the presence of either
DPCB (solid lines) or DPSB (dotted lines) with different molar fractions
(XICZL) (a). Total lipid amount used in
the monolayer experiments was 9 nmol (DPPC + ICZL). The arrows in
(a) indicate plateau regions for the DPPC–DPCB combinations
where the tilt angle of the DPCB headgroups should change from parallel
to perpendicular to the air/water interface (as shown in (b)). Comparison
of the π–A isotherms of the equimolar
mixtures composed of lipids whose headgroup charge arrangements were
parallel or antiparallel (b). For all measurements of the isotherms,
the subphase contained ultrapure water. The temperature of the subphase
was 20 °C. The isotherms were from two or more independent measurements.

In the isotherm of pure DPPC (Figure 2a; XICZL = 0),
a plateau region resulting from a liquid expansion (LE)–liquid
condensation (LC) coexistence phase was observed at 65–85 Å2, which is the almost same with those found in the literatures.41−43 It is thought that the LE–LC coexistence phase arises from
competition between attractive line tension and repulsive dipole interactions
between the headgroups.41,44−46 In the π–A isotherms of the DPPC–DPCB
combination at the higher molar fraction range of DPCB, XDPCB = 0.7–1.0, plateau regions were observed at
a surface pressure of ∼40 mN/m (Figure 2a, arrows). As the molar fraction of DPCB
decreased, these plateau regions narrowed and finally disappeared
when XDPCB was ≤0.6. There is a
possibility that the monolayer undergoes a first-order phase transition
in the plateau regions. However, the surface pressure of the plateau
region observed in the pure DPCB isotherm was much higher than that
in the pure DPPC isotherm (Figure 2a; XDPCB = 1.0). Although
the mechanism underlying the phase transition of the DPCB monolayer
could not be determined at the present stage, we assumed that the
tilt angle of CB headgroups in the monolayers is altered in the plateau
region of the isotherms.

To clarify the effect of the headgroup
combinations on lipid packing
(shrinkage or expansion) in the monolayers, we acquired isotherms
of the monolayers comprising different lipid combinations with parallel
or antiparallel headgroup charges (Figure 2b). As discussed in our previous report,17 there was a marked reduction in area per molecule
in the DPPC–DPSB combination at the lower range of surface
pressures (π < ∼30 mN/m) compared to that in pure
lipid systems of DPPC or DPSB (Figure 2b, green and blue plain lines and black plain line).
At the higher surface pressure (π > ∼30 mN/m), however,
the isotherm of DPPC–DPSB resembled that of a pure lipid system.
Considering this result, the intermolecular attraction between the
antiparallel PC and SB headgroups seems to be effective only in the
low surface pressure range. In the high surface pressure range, the
intermolecular interaction between the headgroups was hidden for the
DPPC–DPSB system. In a previous report, molecular dynamics
simulations showed that SB moieties formed intermolecular interaction
between them, whereas CB moieties did not.47 It can be assumed that the intermolecular interaction between the
headgroups limits the mobility of the headgroups. Thus, the tilt angle
of the SB headgroup in the monolayer may be less variable than that
of the CB headgroup because of the stronger self-association between
SB moieties. On the other hand, for the DPPC–DPCB combination,
reduction of the area per molecule was observed over all ranges of
surface pressure compared to the area per molecule values of the pure
lipid systems, DPPC or DPCB (Figure 2b, magenta and blue plain lines and black dashed line).
At the low surface pressure range (π < ∼40 mN/m),
the reduction in the area per molecule should be attributed to the
intermolecular attraction between the antiparallel PC and CB headgroups.
At high surface pressure (π = ∼40 mN/m), the tilt angle
of CB headgroups may be changed from parallel to perpendicular to
the monolayer surface. The intermolecular interaction between the
PC and CB headgroups may be modulated by such rearrangement of the
CB headgroup orientation, which should contribute to further reduction
of area per molecule of the DPPC–DPCB combination even at a
high surface pressure region (π > ∼40 mN/m). Headgroup
mobility should be one of distinguished differences between DPCB and
DPSB. Interestingly, the π–A isotherm
of the DPCB–DPSB system (Figure 2b, dotted line), which is a combination of lipids with
parallel headgroup charges, was shifted to lower area slightly compared
to the isotherms of the pure lipids (Figure 2b, green and magenta lines). This result
indicates that the SB headgroups attractively interact with the CB
headgroups slightly even though they have parallel charge orientation
to each other. Such attractive interaction may occur only when these
headgroups orient parallel to the air/water interface. This parallel
orientation to the air/water interface is the cause of the relatively
large molecular area of the DPCB–DPSB combination (Figure 2b, dotted line) than
that of the antiparallel combinations (Figure 2b, black dashed line and black plain line).
Comparing π–A isotherms at π <
40 mN/m, the area per molecule of pure DPSB was smaller than that
of pure DPCB (Figure 2b, green and magenta lines), which indicates that the intermolecular
attraction occurred between SB headgroups.

According to previous
literature data, multiple factors are related
to zwitterionic associations. To explain intermolecular interactions
between the lipids with zwitterionic headgroups, the following factors
should be considered, in particular, (i) charge densities of cationic
and anionic groups in the zwitterion, (ii) the carbon spacer length
(CSL) between the cationic and anionic groups in the zwitterion, and
(iii) the hydration state of the zwitterionic group. Moreover, these
factors are related to each other. For instance, charge densities
of the charged group are modulated by the CSL.48 The charge density is critical to the hydration of the
zwitterions.49 The interaction between
zwitterionic groups is inversely related to the degree of hydration
of the zwitterion.50,51

To dictate the zwitterionic
association, Shao et al. have proposed
a concept in terms of matching degree of charge densities of zwitterions.47 They reported that the charge densities of the
cationic and anionic groups in sulfobetaine (CSL = 3) and carboxybetaine
(CSL = 2) were +3.0 and −4.5 e/nm3 and +3.0 and
−5.3 e/nm3, respectively. In their report, the intermolecular
self-association of these zwitterions is stronger as the difference
in the absolute values of charge densities between the cationic and
anionic groups become smaller. Thus, in this case, the intermolecular
self-association of the sulfobetaines should occur more favorably
than that of the carboxybetaines.

In addition to the concept
of charge density, CSL should also be
considered. It has been reported that the charge densities in the
zwitterion decrease with the decreasing CSL.48 In particular, the charge density of the anionic group in the zwitterion
is more affected by the CSL than that of the cationic group. Moreover,
the large difference in the charge density is observed when CSL ≤ 3. In
the present study, CSL of the DPCB is shorter than that used in the
literature.47 Therefore, zwitterionic groups
in DPCB should be less charged. Thus, there is a possibility that
matching charge densities between CB and PC headgroups might be higher
than those between SB and PC headgroups (charge densities in cationic
and anionic groups in PC were calculated to be +3.0 and −3.0
e/nm3, respectively47). However,
it should be noted that the charge density theory is not completely
adequate to dictate zwitterionic association. For example, on the
basis of the charge density theory, the intermolecular interaction
between phosphocholines is stronger than that in sulfobetaines
and carboxybetaines. The π–A isotherm
of pure DPPC in the present study, however, showed that this is not
the case. The area per molecule of DPPC at low surface pressure (≤10
mN/m) was larger than that of DPSB (Figure 2b, blue and green plain lines). This suggests
that the intermolecular interaction between PC headgroups should be
weaker than the estimated degree from the charge density theory. Zwitterionic
association may be dominated by not only degree of the matching charge
densities but also hydration state of the zwitterionic groups.

It is known that the hydration state of the zwitterionic group
is related to the intermolecular interaction between the zwitterions.
The intermolecular interaction between zwitterions is weaker (stronger)
with increasing (decreasing) hydration strength of the zwitterions.50,51 The hydration state tends to be changed depending on charge densities
of zwitterionic groups.48 The number of
water molecules in the coordination shell of the zwitterion increases
with increasing charge densities of the cationic and anionic moieties.
Simulation studies revealed that sulfonate and carboxylate anions
of zwitterions (CSL = 2) have 7.08 and 5.94 water molecules in their
coordination shells, respectively.33 Therefore,
the number of coordinated water molecules of the sulfonate moiety
in DPSB should be larger than 7.08 because of their higher charge
density arising from the longer CSL compared to that in the literature.33 On the other hand, carboxylate moieties of DPCB
should have less water molecules because of its shorter CSL. It can
be assumed that the less hydration water in the zwitterion in DPCB
may contribute to a more compressed state observed in the monolayer
when mixing with DPPC.

Extrapolated Molecular Area of Lipids
The extrapolated
area (AL) represents the mean cross-sectional
area of a single lipid molecule that is free from the external pressure
exerted by the surrounding lipids in the condensed lipid monolayer;
it can be used as an indicator of the geometry of the lipid and for
evaluating the intermolecular interactions between lipids in the mixed
lipid monolayer. The AL values for the
different lipid combinations are shown in Figure 3 (open circles for DPPC–DPSB and filled
symbols for DPPC–DPCB). In both lipid combinations, negative
deviation from the ideal additivity of a mixed system was observed
at any XICZL. This indicates that attractive
interaction dominated in both lipid combinations. In addition, the AL values of the DPPC–DPSB combinations
for any molar fractions were higher than those of the DPPC–DPCB
combinations. This indicates that the intermolecular interaction between
DPPC and DPCB was more favorable than that between DPPC and DPSB.

Figure 3 Extrapolated
molecular area (AL) of
the lipid comprising the lipid monolayer. The open circles represent
the AL values of the DPPC and DPSB system.
The filled symbols represent the AL values
of the DPPC and DPCB system. There were two series of AL values in the DPPC–DPCB system, which were determined
at high (filled circles) and low (triangles) surface pressures. The
π–A isotherms for DPPC–DPSB mixtures
do not have plateau regions (Figure 2a). This indicates that the tilt angle of DPSB does
not change even though the lipid monolayer is laterally compressed.
Thus, AL for the DPPC–DPSB mixtures
was determined as a single value at each lipid composition. The dotted
lines represent the ideal additivity for both systems. The p-values for all series of AL were < 0.01 (one-way ANOVA, n ≥ 3). Data

In the mixed lipid monolayer comprising the DPPC–DPSB
combination,
the minimum value of AL was observed at XDPSB = 0.5 (Figure 3, open circles). This indicates that a combination
of lipids with antiparallel headgroup charges formed an equimolar
complex (1:1 molar ratio) in the lipid layer. Although such equimolar
complex formation seems to be a general feature in lipid combinations
that have antiparallel headgroups, the AL data for the DPPC–DPCB combination negated the generality
of equimolar complex formation. At XDPCB = 0.8, the AL of the lipid monolayer
comprising DPPC and DPCB exhibited a minimum value (41.5 ± 0.5
Å2) (Figure 3, filled circle). This indicates that the mixed lipid monolayer
was mostly shrunk at the molar composition of DPCB/DPPC = 4:1. At XDPCB = 0.2 and 0.5, negative peaks in the AL were observed, indicating that the mixed monolayer
was shrunk at these molar fractions as well. At these molar fractions,
DPCB and DPPC form complexes with the molar composition of DPCB/DPPC
= 1:4 and 1:1, which may be a metastable state because values of the
excess free energy of mixing (ΔGExc) at XDPCB = 0.2 and 0.5 were not minimum.
Such complex formation at XDPCB = 0.2
or 0.8 (not equimolar composition) indicates that complicated interaction
being relevant to charge densities and/or hydration state of the zwitterionic
groups should contribute to the interaction between DPPC and DPCB.

Because there were plateau regions in isotherms of the DPPC–DPCB
combination at XDPCB = 0.7–1, we
could obtain two series of AL values corresponding
to both sides of the plateau regions. The AL value of pure DPCB was 61.2 ± 2.8 Å2 at the
lower surface pressure (Figure 3, triangle, XDPCB = 1). This value
was not surprising considering that the glycerolipid in the monolayer
had a dipalmitoyl tailgroup. For example, the cross-sectional area
of DPPC in the LE phase is 63.9–67.7 Å2 at
25 °C.42 At the higher surface pressure
region, the AL value of pure DPCB was
44.8 ± 1.0 Å2 (Figure 3, filled circle, XDPCB = 1). This value was slightly lower than that of DPPC in the LC
phase (44–47.9 Å2 at 20 °C).42 As discussed in the previous section, there
is a possibility that DPCB undergoes phase transition at the plateau
regions in the isotherms of DPCB. Changes in the CB headgroup orientation
may involve the phase transition. If DPCB changes the headgroup orientation
in response to lateral compression, the tilt angles of the headgroup
at the lower AL should be more perpendicular
than those at the higher AL values.

Effect of Mixing DPCB on Compressibility Modulus of the Lipid
Monolayer
To investigate the effect of mixing ICZLs and DPPC
on the compressibility modulus (Cs–1), the Cs–1 values were plotted as a function of area per molecule at given
molar fractions (Figure 4a). As an overall trend, the Cs–1 values increased with decreasing A when the monolayers
were gradually compressed laterally until they collapsed. Although
we clearly observed a temporary uplift of Cs–1 that corresponded to the phase transition from
the LE phase to the LE–LC phase in pure DPPC, the uplift disappeared
when mixing with even a small amount of ICZL. We observed Cs–1 peaks at relatively small A regions in the DPPC–DPCB combination (Figure 4a, filled symbols)
compared with those in the DPPC–DPSB combination (Figure 4a, open symbols).
The maximum compressibility moduli (MaxCs–1) did not change at any XDPCB and remained in the ranges 280–350 and 200–240
mN/m in the high and low surface pressure regions, respectively (Figure 4b, filled symbols).
The unexpected result indicates that mixing DPCB with DPPC did not
have a strong influence on the maximum compressibility modulus of
the monolayer, whereas mixing these lipids caused shrinkage of the
monolayer. Even at XDPCB = 0.8, when the
lipids may form a complex, we did not observe any increment of MaxCs–1. In contrast
to that of the DPPC–DPCB combination, the Cs–1 of the DPPC–DPSB combination
increased slightly, although the difference was not significant.

At XDPCB = 0.7–1, there
were
two series of MaxCs–1 values ranging 220–240 and 280–350 mN/m (Figure 4b). These two series
of MaxCs–1 values correspond to low (∼40 Å2) and high
(∼50 Å2) area per molecule, respectively (Figure 4a, indicated with
arrows). According to a review of the DPPC monolayer, the phase state
of the monolayer can be classified from the Cs–1 value, that is, the LE phase occurs at
10–50 mN/m, the LC phase occurs at 100–250 mN/m, and
the solid phase occurs at >250 mN/m.42 According
to such a classification, the observed plateau regions of the isotherms
at XDPCB = 0.7–1 (Figure 2a) may be attributed to the
transition from the LC phase to the solid phase.

Excess Free
Energy of Mixing Lipids in the Monolayer
To investigate the
extent of the spontaneous mixing of ICZLs and
DPPC in the monolayer, we calculated the excess free energy of mixing
(ΔGExc) DPPC and ICZLs at a given XICZL (Figure 5). In general, a negative ΔGExc value indicates that mixing can occur spontaneously,
which is a thermodynamically favorable process. As an overall trend
in both lipid combinations, the values of ΔGExc for the mixed monolayer moved in the negative direction
with increasing surface pressure (π) except for the DPPC–DPCB
combination with XDPCB = 0.1. This suggests
that DPPC and ICZLs mixing becomes more thermodynamically favorable
with increasing π.

Figure 5 Excess free energy of mixing (ΔGExc) as a function of XDPCB (a) and XDPSB (b) at various
surface pressure regions:
0–5 (open circles), 0–10 (filled circles), 0–20
(open triangles), 0–30 (filled triangles), and 0–40
mN/m (diamonds). The dashed line represents the ideal ΔGExc value for the binary system composed of
DPPC and DPCB. The p-values for all surface pressure
ranges were < 0.01 for the DPCB lipid mixture. For the DPSB mixture,
the p-values for surface pressure ranges 0–10,
0–20, 0–30, and 0–40 mN/m were <0.01. For
surface pressure range 0–5 mN, p > 0.05
(one-way
ANOVA, n ≥ 3). Data for the DPPC–DPSB
combination reprinted with permission from ref (17). Copyright 2017 American
Chemical Society.

The values of ΔGExc for the DPPC–DPCB
combination (Figure 5a) were lower than those for the DPPC–DPSB combination (Figure 5b) at the same surface
pressure region. This indicates that mixing was more thermodynamically
favored in the DPPC–DPCB combination than in the DPPC–DPSB
combination. For the DPPC–DPCB combination, the most favorable
spontaneous mixing of the lipids occurs at XDPCB = 0.6–0.8 (not equimolar), which were relatively
high DPCB compositions. This result indicates that the mechanism underlying
the favorable mixing of the lipids is not dominated through a simple
Coulombic interaction but should be related to the degree of matching
charge densities and/or hydration states of the zwitterions. When
surface pressure reaches ∼40 mN/m, it should be necessary to
take into account the changing orientation of CB headgroups occurred in the phase transition
of the monolayer. Such a change in the headgroup orientation should
allow the lipids to be further densely packed in the monolayer, which
may contribute to further lowering of ΔGExc for the mixed monolayer.

Effect of Mixing DPCB on
the Gel-to-Liquid Crystal Phase Transition
Temperature of the Lipid Dispersion
The gel-to-liquid crystal
phase transition temperature (Tc) reflects
the favorability of the intermolecular interaction between the lipid
molecules in the bilayer membrane. To minimize the effect of the curvature
of the vesicles on the phase transition temperature, large vesicles
were used for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements
in the present study. Figure 6a shows the representative DSC thermograms and mean values
of Tc for the aqueous dispersion of vesicles
comprising DPPC and DPCB. For the mixed lipid system, the Tc significantly increased with increasing XDPCB until XDPCB was 0.6 (Figure 6b). In the range of XDPCB = 0.6–0.8,
the value of Tc remained at the higher
level. This suggests that the intermolecular interaction between lipids
was greatest at XDPCB = 0.6–0.8
in the lipid bilayer. This was consistent with the results for the
lipid monolayer discussed in the previous sections. Moreover, at XICZL = 0.5–0.9, the values of Tc for the DPPC–DPCB combination were
significantly larger than those for the DPPC–DPSB combination.
This indicates that the intermolecular interaction between PC and
CB combinations is more favorable than that between PC and SB combinations
at XICZL = 0.5–0.9.

using Student’s t-test. As a result, p-values were less than 0.05 at all compositions of ICZLs
except for XICZL = 0. The data for the
DPPC–DPSB combination reprinted with permission from ref (17). Copyright 2016 American
Chemical Society.

The sharpness of the
endothermic peaks reflects the mixing state
of the lipid in the bilayer in the gel phase. At lower ICZL content
(XICZL = 0.1–0.3), the endothermic
peaks were broad (Figure 6a). This indicates that lipids comprising the bilayer exist
in a poorly mixed state. With regard to the thermogram of pure DPSB,
there were two endothermic peaks at 40.8 and 56.8 °C (Figure 6a, XDPSB = 1). This indicates that pure DPSB forms lipid domains
that have different lipid associations with each other, as we discussed
in our previous report,17 whereas the thermogram
for pure DPCB exhibited a single endothermic peak at 52.0 ± 0.1
°C. This indicates that DPCB existed in a single state in the
bilayer where the lipid molecules were uniformly mixed and interacted
evenly with each other without domain formation.

Figure 6a,c illustrates
a comparison of the DSC thermograms of the pure lipids with those
of each equimolar lipid combination comprising parallel or antiparallel
headgroup charges. With regard to the combinations of PC–CB
and PC–SB, which had antiparallel headgroups, the Tc values of the equimolar mixtures were higher than those
of the pure lipids, which indicates enhancement of the intermolecular
interaction between the lipids. With regard to the mixtures comprising
lipids with parallel headgroup charges, the Tc values were intermediate between DPSB and DPCB. This indicates
that a combination of parallel headgroup charges does not enhance
the intermolecular interaction of lipids.

Conclusions
In
the present work, we revealed that binary lipid combinations
with antiparallel headgroup charges can exert attractive intermolecular
interactions in the lipid monolayer and bilayer. A lipid combination
comprising 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-carboxybetaine
(DPCB) had more favorable intermolecular interaction than that comprising
DPPC and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-sulfobetaine
(DPSB). This was supported by the excess free energy of the mixed
monolayer and the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperature
of the mixed bilayer. Such attractive interaction in both lipid combinations
results from the interaction between the headgroups (PC–CB
and PC–SB), which are antiparallel to each other. In the highly
compressed lipid monolayers and vesicles (lipid bilayer), the molar
fractions of ICZLs, in which the intermolecular interaction reached
a maximum, were 0.6–0.8 for the DPPC–DPCB combination
and 0.5 (equimolar composition) for the DPPC–DPSB combination.
Therefore, for the compressed monolayers and bilayers, the mechanism
of intermolecular interaction between DPPC and DPCB is different from
that between DPPC and DPSB. Different charge densities and/or hydration
states between SB and CB headgroups should be attributed to different
interactions observed in their binary mixture with DPPC. At a highly
compressed state of the DPPC–DPCB combination, the changing
orientation of the CB headgroup should contribute to further shrinkage
of the monolayer.

Materials and Methods
Materials
DPPC
(>99% purity) was purchased from Yuka
Sangyo (Tokyo, Japan) and used without further purification. DPCB
and DPSB were synthesized according to previously published methods
(refs (12) and (17) for DPCB and DPSB, respectively).
The purity of these lipids was confirmed by thin layer chromatography
(DPCB; Rf = 0.64, CHCl3/MeOH
= 9:1, visualized by iodine or bromocresol green, DPSB; Rf = 0.60, CHCl3/MeOH = 8:2, visualized
by iodine). To prepare lipid stock solutions, a given lipid was dried
under reduced pressure at room temperature and then dissolved in organic
solvent (CHCl3 for the DPCB mixture, CHCl3/MeOH
= 8:2 for the DPSB mixture). Ultrapure water was obtained using the
Milli-Q system (resistivity: 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C; Merck-Millipore).

Acquisition of π–A Isotherms
Surface pressure–area (π–A)
isotherms were acquired using a trough equipped with a Wilhelmy
plate (KSV NIMA Small; Biolin Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden). To prepare
sample solutions, the lipid stock solution containing ICZL (DPSB or
DPCB) was mixed with DPPC stock solution at a desired molar fraction
of ICZL with respect to DPPC (total lipid concentration: 0.5 mM).
To form monolayers at the air/water interface, 17 μL of the
sample solution was spread on the subphase filled with ultrapure water
using a microsyringe. After spreading the lipid, the monolayer was
equilibrated on the subphase for 15 min at 20 °C. The isotherms
were acquired under the following conditions: the barrier speed was
5 mm/min and the temperature of the subphase was maintained at 20
°C. The extrapolated area (AL) represents
the cross-sectional area of a single lipid molecule, which is free
from external pressure from the surrounding lipids in the condensed
lipid monolayer.17 The compressibility
modulus (Cs–1) of the
lipid monolayers was calculated using eq 1(39) 1  where π is the surface
pressure of the
lipid monolayer at the air/water interface and A is
the occupied molecular area per single molecule constituting the lipid
monolayer. The miscibility of lipids in the mixed monolayer and the
interactions between lipid components were analyzed quantitatively
on the basis of the excess free energy of mixing (ΔGExc) calculated for the obtained π–A isotherms, as defined in eq 2 2  where A12 is the
occupied molecular area for a particular composition of a mixed monolayer
at a given surface pressure; A1 and A2 are the occupied molecular areas for pure
monolayers of components 1 and 2 at the same surface pressure, respectively; X1 and X2 indicate
the molar fractions of the components in the mixed monolayer; and NA is Avogadro’s number.40

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
To determine
the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperature (Tc) of the aqueous dispersion composed of pure or mixed
lipids, DSC was carried out using a DSC 1 calorimeter (Mettler Toledo,
Switzerland). The lipid dispersions for DSC were prepared as follows.
To prepare the sample for DSC measurements, the lipid stock solution
containing ICZL (DPSB or DPCB) was mixed with DPPC stock solution
at a desired molar fraction of ICZL with respect to DPPC. The sample
solution was placed in a 10 mL round-bottomed flask. The solvent was
then removed by rotary evaporation to form a thin lipid layer at the
bottom. The obtained lipid film was hydrated in ultrapure water for
2 min at 80 °C with gentle agitation. The total lipid concentration
in the dispersion was 20 mM. The hydrated lipid was agitated using
a AZU-6D bath-type sonicator (As One, Osaka, Japan) for 1 min at 80
°C. The obtained lipid dispersion (40 μL) was added to
a 100 μL aluminum pan and sealed tightly with a lid. The scan
rate was 2 °C/min during the heating and cooling processes. Tc was defined as the onset temperature of the
endothermic peaks.

Statistical Analysis
The AL, Cs–1, ΔGExc, and Tc as functions
of the molar fraction of ICZL in DPPC (XICZL) are represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical
analysis of these data was carried out by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) using Excel 2016 software (Microsoft). Significant difference
was defined as p < 0.05.
