A delafossite-type
Ag–Mn oxide was successfully synthesized
using the precipitation method at room temperature. The delafossite
is Ag+-deficient and has a chemical composition of Ag0.9MnO2. Thermogravimetry of the Ag0.9MnO2 delafossite revealed that on heating to 900 °C,
it decomposed to Ag and Mn2O3 in air and to
Ag and Mn3O4 under N2. While cooling
to room temperature in air, the delafossite phase reformed from Ag
and Mn3O4. The reversibility of the decomposition/reformation
process is related to the similarity between the delafossite and spinel-type
structures, both of which contain an octahedral layer. The reformation
process could be used as a new synthetic route to Ag+-containing
delafossite-type oxides.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Delafossite-type AgMO2 (M: trivalent cation) has been
reported, which can be considered Ag+-containing oxides,
consisting of layers of edge-sharing MO6 octahedra with
two-coordinated Ag+ cations occupying the interlayer sites.1−3 The Ag-containing delafossites have attracted attention as functional
materials for electrodes,4,5 photocatalysts,6−10 transparent semiconductors,11−13 solar cells,14,15 and gas sensors.16 Solid-state reactions
of Ag2O and M2O3 oxides are not suitable
for the synthesis of AgMO2 delafossites, as Ag2O decomposes to metallic Ag at a low temperature.17 Several AgMO2 delafossites have been synthesized
by the ion exchange method using AMO2 (A: alkali metal)
and a molten salt containing AgNO3. For example, AgCoO2 was synthesized by exchange of the Li+ in LiCoO2 with Ag+ from molten AgNO3–KNO3 salt, at 250 °C. In addition, AgMO2 (M =
Al, Fe, Ni, Ga, Ni, Sc, In) has been synthesized using the hydrothermal
method, and the coprecipitation method has been used for AgMO2 (M = Fe, Ga) synthesis at low temperatures.18−20 In 2007, AgMnO2 was synthesized via the ion exchange
method using LiMnO2.21 Kodintsev
et al. reported the deposition of AgMnO2 on the Ni plate
by coprecipitation for use as an electrode material for energy storage;
however, it was the composite material containing a large quantity
of Ag.22 Low-temperature synthesis is suitable
to obtain fine particles of the delafossite for use in catalytic and
energy storage applications. However, synthesis of AgMnO2 by hydrothermal or other synthetic methods has not been reported.
In this study, we successfully synthesized the Ag and Mn-containing
delafossite as a single phase, by coprecipitation at room temperature,
and investigated its high-temperature decomposition and reformation.

2 Experimental Section
Ag and Mn-containing oxides were
prepared by the coprecipitation
method. AgNO3 and Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O were used as starting materials. AgNO3 was dissolved
in 30 mL distilled water, and 5.9 mL of a 4 mol/L aqueous solution
of HNO3 was added. Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O was dissolved in 30 mL distilled water, and the resulting
solution was mixed with the Ag solution. The molar ratios of Ag/Mn
(x:1) were adjusted to x = 0.7–1.0.
An NaOH–H2O2 solution was prepared by
mixing 12 mL 3% H2O2 in water and 14–16
mL of 2 mol/L aqueous NaOH and stirring for 1 h. NaOH (2 mol/L) or
the NaOH–H2O2 solution was added to the
Ag–Mn solution, and the resultant mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 24 h. The resulting precipitate was washed with distilled
water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Phase identification was performed
by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation
(Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer). Rietveld analysis was carried out
using the RIETAN-FP software.23 The elemental
composition of the sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, SPS5500, SII NanoTechnology).
The average oxidation state of Mn in the sample was evaluated by iodometric
titration. The sample (0.06 g) was dissolved in a solution of 5 mL
KI (1 mol/L) and 5 mL HCl (6 mol/L), and 40 mL of distilled water
was added. During the dissolution process, Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the sample were reduced to Mn2+ by I– as per the following reaction 1 1  

The Ag+ in the sample was precipitated as AgI, which
is insoluble in water.

The quantity of I2 formed
by reaction 1 was measured by titration using
an aqueous solution of 0.1
mol/L Na2S2O3, and the average oxidation
number of Mn was calculated from the quantity of I2.

The thermal stability of the sample was evaluated by thermogravimetry
(TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) using Rigaku TG–DTA
8120 and Shimadzu TGA-50H. The measurements were performed in air
or under an N2 flow, first heating to 900 or 1000 °C,
and then cooling to 100 °C, at a rate of 10 K/min. The morphology
of the particles was investigated using a field-emission scanning
electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU-70).

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The
XRD patterns for the
samples with an Ag/Mn molar ratio of 1:1, prepared by varying the
OH– concentration in the NaOH solution, are shown
in Figure 1. The delafossite
phase was formed under acidic conditions (NaOH 14–15 mL, pH
= 5.1–6.3) without H2O2 addition. In
addition, Ag (ICDD-PDF# 4-0783) and a smaller quantity of Mn3O4 (ICDD-PDF# 71-6262) were observed at pH = 6.3. At higher
pH, no delafossite phase formed, and instead Ag and Mn3O4 were observed. In order to suppress formation of the
Ag metal, H2O2 was added in the NaOH solution
and the Ag/Mn ratio was varied. The XRD patterns for the samples prepared
by varying the Ag/Mn ratio in the starting solution (H2O2 12 mL + NaOH 15 mL) are shown in Figure 2. In the pattern for x =
0.8, all the peaks were indexed on the basis of a monoclinic unit
cell similar to that of AgMnO2, reported by Koriche et
al.21 In the patterns for x = 0.7, 0.9, and 1.0, additional peaks, attributed to the Ag metal
and Mn3O4, were observed. In the single-phase
delafossite obtained for x = 0.8, the Ag/Mn ratio
deviated from the stoichiometric ratio. The pH value of the solution
for x = 0.8 was 6.5. From the results of the ICP-AES
measurement, the Ag/Mn ratio in the single-phase sample was 0.90:1
and the Ag/Na ratio was 0.9:0.01. These results suggest that the lattice
is Ag+-deficient and that the Na+ concentration
is low. The average oxidation state of the sample, determined by the
iodometric titration, was +3.14, which is close to +3.1, the value
estimated for a charge neutral lattice with an Ag/Mn ratio of 0.90:1.
Structure refinement using XRD data was performed for the x = 0.8 sample. The initial structural model was based on
CuMnO2 including cation vacancies at the Cu sites. As the
Na content was low, distribution of Na+ into the two prismatic
sites was not considered. The observed, calculated, and difference
curves are shown in Figure 3. The refined structural parameters are listed in Table 1. The lattice parameters
of the delafossite sample were a = 0.55647(5) nm, b = 0.28923(2) nm, c = 0.63001(6) nm, and
β = 100.837(6)°. The value of a is shorter
and that of c is longer than those of the stoichiometric
AgMnO2 (a = 0.5583 nm, b = 0.2894 nm, c = 0.6293 nm, and β = 100.6°)
synthesized by the ion exchange method,21 suggesting compositional deviation of the delafossite phase. The
Ag/Mn ratio estimated from the refined occupation factor g of the Ag(2d) site was 0.86:1, which is close to the value obtained
by ICP-AES measurement. In addition, the average chemical state of
Mn estimated from the refined composition is +3.14, which is identical
to that determined by iodometric titration. The value of a is affected by the ionic radii of the Mn cations in the MnO6 octahedral layer. As described above, the average oxidation
state of Mn was higher than +3, indicating the presence of Mn4+, which has an ionic radius (0.053 nm) smaller than that
of Mn3+ (0.0645 nm for the high spin state).24 Oxidation of Mn3+ occurred to satisfy
the demand for charge compensation related to the Ag+ deficiency.
Ag-deficient delafossite Ag1–xCoO2−δ has been reported by Shin et al.25 The structure of the Ag-deficient phase, Ag0.95CoO2−δ, is 2H-type, while that
of stoichiometric AgCoO2 is 3R-type. Because their lattice
parameters (a) were similar, it was concluded that
the oxidation state of Co was +3 in both delafossites. These results
indicate that the Ag+-deficient delafossite phase, Ag0.9MnO2, was obtained by the precipitation method
at room temperature in the present study.

3.2. Thermal Stability
of Ag0.9MnO2
The thermal stability
of the Ag0.9MnO2 delafossite
was investigated by TG–DTA measurements in air, up to 1000
°C. In the TG curve shown in Figure 4, four mass losses were observed in the temperature
ranges 30–200, 350–500, 700–800, and 900–950
°C. In the DTA curve, four apparent endothermic peaks were observed
at 628, 748, 937, and 954 °C. The peaks at 748 and 937 °C
were accompanied by large mass losses. To clarify the thermal behavior,
a high-temperature XRD measurement was performed on Ag0.9MnO2, while heating up to 950 °C, in air, as shown
in Figure 5. The heating
rate was 10 K/min, and the temperature was maintained at 300, 500,
700, and 800 °C while diffraction scans took place. The delafossite
phase was observed up to 500 °C. However, it disappeared in the
temperature range 700–800 °C. In the XRD pattern recorded
at 800 °C, peaks for metallic Ag and Mn2O3 were observed, indicating that reductive decomposition had occurred.
The endothermic DTA peak at approximately 954 °C, without an
accompanying mass change, was attributed to Ag melting (Tm = 961 °C). The diffraction peaks observed at 700
°C were not assigned to well-known compounds. The endothermic
peak at 628 °C, accompanied by a slight mass loss, suggested
that the transformation or decomposition of Ag0.9MnO2 to an unknown phase occurred. In the XRD pattern of Ag0.9MnO2 after heating at 700 °C and quenching
to room temperature (not shown here), the Ag metal and Mn2O3 were observed in addition to the unknown phase. Further
investigation is necessary to clarify the composition and structure
of this unknown phase.

to 1000 °C, in air.

Figure 5 High-temperature XRD patterns of Ag0.9MnO2 in
air, at (a) room temperature to 500 and (b) 700–800 °C.

In order to determine the cause
of the mass losses below 500 °C,
desorption gas analysis was performed. The TG curve of Ag0.9MnO2, measured under an N2 flow, is shown in Figure 6. Three mass loss
steps were observed in the temperature ranges 30–300, 300–500,
and 500–700 °C. A temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
measurement was performed in order to investigate the gas species
which caused the mass loss in each temperature range. The TPD curves
for the species produced (mass to charge ratios, m/z = 18, 32, and 44) are shown in Figure 7. Large peaks were observed
at 450 and 650 °C for m/z =
44 and 32, respectively, indicating that the mass losses at 300–500
and 500–650 °C were caused by CO2 elimination
and O2 generation, respectively. The curve for m/z = 18 indicates that the mass loss below
200 °C was due to desorption of water. The O2 generation
above 600 °C suggests the reduction of the Ag0.9MnO2 delafossite. The reductive reaction of the delafossite to
metallic silver and manganese oxides are represented by reactions 2 and 3. 2   3

under N2.

Figure 7 Gas desorption profiles of Ag0.9MnO2 for m/z = 18 (H2O), 32 (O2), and 44 (CO2).

The theoretical mass losses during the reactions are 5.80
and 4.35%
for reactions 2 and 3,
respectively. The observed mass loss in the temperature range 500–750
°C was 5.77%, suggesting that Ag0.9MnO2 decomposed to Ag and Mn3O4 under N2.

The thermal decomposition behavior of Ag0.9MnO2 was investigated in detail by TG measurements during both
the heating
and cooling processes, in air, and under N2 flows, at temperatures
up to 900 °C. The samples were heated at 500 °C for 1 h
in air to eliminate CO2 and water before measurement. In
the TG curve under air flow, shown in Figure 8, a large mass loss, corresponding to 4.58%,
was observed in the temperature range 700–800 °C during
the heating process, and no mass change occurred during the cooling
process. In the TG curve under N2 flow, shown in Figure 9, a mass loss of
5.86% was observed in the temperature range 500–700 °C
during the heating process, and no mass change occurred during the
cooling process. These mass losses in air and N2 flows
are comparable to those calculated for the Ag0.9MnO2 decomposition reactions represented by reactions 2 and 3, respectively.

Figure 10 shows
the XRD patterns of the samples after the TG measurements under (a)
air, and (b) N2. These results confirmed the formation
of α-Mn2O3 (ICDD-PDF# 73-1826) and Mn3O4 under air and N2, respectively. Figure 11 shows the TG curve
for the process of heating under an N2 flow and cooling
under an air flow. A mass loss was observed in the temperature range
500–700 °C in the heating process, and a recovery of mass
occurred below 670 °C in the cooling process. After the measurement,
the single-phase delafossite was obtained, as shown in Figure 10c. These results suggest the
reformation of the delafossite from the mixture of Ag and Mn3O4, which formed in N2, during the cooling
process in air.

in N2, and cooling to 100 °C, in air, after heating
at 500 °C, for 1 h, in air.

SEM images of the freshly prepared Ag0.9MnO2, and the samples after the TG measurements are shown in Figure 12. The particle
size of the unheated delafossite was smaller than 500 nm, and thin
plate-like particles were observed. After the TG measurements at temperatures
of up to 900 °C in air, and under N2, granular particles
with sizes of less than 500 nm were observed, in both cases. After
the TG measurement performed with heating up to 900 °C under
N2 and subsequently cooling to room temperature in air,
granular particles were observed. The particles appeared larger than
those observed after the measurement in N2. The XRD pattern
of the sample shown in Figure 10c indicated that it was the single-phase delafossite,
similar to the original Ag0.9MnO2, however,
plate-like particles were not observed. These results suggest that
the shape of the reformed delafossite phase was influenced by that
of the Ag or Mn3O4 particles.

after heating at 900 °C in (b)
air and (c) N2, and (d) heating in N2 at 900
°C and cooling in air to room temperature.

The back-scattered images of the sample after the TG measurement
with heating of up to 900 °C under N2 are shown in Figure 13. Large bright
particles surrounded by smaller particles were observed. This indicates
that coarsening of Ag particles formed by reduction of the Ag0.9MnO2 delafossite occurred upon heating to 900
°C. As described above, the delafossite phase was regenerated
during cooling in air and its particle size was larger than that of
the Mn3O4 in the sample after TG measurement
in N2 at 900 °C. Therefore, it is believed that Ag
species diffuse toward the Mn3O4 particles,
resulting in reformation the delafossite phase.

images of Ag0.9MnO2 after heating at 900 °C

The above results indicate
that Ag0.9MnO2 reformed from metallic Ag and
Mn3O4, but not
from Ag and Mn2O3, implying that the crystal
structure of the Mn oxide affects the reformation process. The α-Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 have an orthorhombic
distorted bixbite structure26 and a tetragonal
hausmanite-type structure, respectively, the latter of which is a
spinel-like structure.27,28 We have previously reported the
reversible reformation of Cu(Fe1–xAlx)O2 and Cu(Cr1–xAlx)O2 delafossites
from spinel-type oxides under oxidative/reductive cycles.29,30 In these processes, the delafossites decomposed to metallic Cu and
spinel-type oxides by H2 reduction at 300–800 °C
and reformed by O2 oxidation. The reformation of the Cu
delafossite is similar to the formation of Ag0.9MnO2 from Ag and Mn3O4. However, the regeneration
of the Ag0.9MnO2 delafossite from Ag and Mn3O4 occurred during cooling in air at 670 °C,
where metallic Ag is more stable than Ag2O. We have also
reported that metallic Cu formation by H2-pulse treatment
of CuMnO2 and disappearance of Cu by 50%O2/He-pulse
treatment at 300–500 °C.31 In
this temperature range, Cu2O is more stable than metallic
Cu. This implies that the delafossite regeneration process for Ag1–xMnO2 and CuMnO2 is different. However, further investigation is necessary to clarify
the above process in detail. The delafossite reformation process involving
oxidation of the Ag metal by O2 at 670 °C in air is
interesting and may help to reveal details about the formation process
of Ag delafossites. Sturzenegger et al. reported that the AgNi0.5Ti0.5O2 delafossite decomposed to
Ag and ilumenite-type NiTiO3, in O2, above 650
°C. However, no reformation of the delafossite from either NiTiO3 was reported.32 In contrast, Lalanne
et al. reported that Cu(Fe1–xCrx)O2 decomposed to CuO and spinel-structured
Cu(Fe1–xCrx)2O4, in air, above 400 °C and that
the delafossite phase reformed above 800 °C.33 This delafossite formation includes reduction of the Cu-spinel
structure. Reductive reformation processes from spinel-type intermediates
have been reported for the formation of CuMO2 (M = Al,
Cr, Fe, Mn).34 Transformation processes
between Cu delafossites and spinel-type oxides, with Cu incorporation/deposition,
have been proposed. During these processes, the octahedral MO6 layer in both structures is maintained.30,33 From the above results, we can extend the transformations between
delafossite and spinel-type structures to include Ag-containing compounds.

4 Conclusions
In the present study, we report
the synthesis of a delafossite-type
Ag–Mn oxide by the precipitation method at room temperature.
The delafossite is Ag+-deficient and has a chemical composition
of Ag0.9MnO2. The Ag0.9MnO2 delafossite decomposed to Ag and Mn2O3 in
air, or Ag and Mn3O4 under N2, at
temperatures of 700–800 and 500–700 °C, respectively.
The reformation of the delafossite from metallic Ag and Mn3O4 occurred at approximately 670 °C in air. This
reversible decomposition/reformation process is explained by the similarity
between delafossite and spinel-type structures, both of which include
an octahedral MO6 layer. The reformation process from Ag
and the Mn3O4 spinel phase could provide a valuable
new synthetic route to Ag+-containing delafossite-type
oxides.
