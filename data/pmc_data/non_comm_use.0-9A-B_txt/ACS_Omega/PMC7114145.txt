Herein,
we report the expedient synthesis of new nanocomposite
Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 flakes using simple sol–gel and calcination methods. In order
to prepare this material, first, we generated a polymeric gel using
cost-effective and easily accessible precursors such as SnCl4, titanium isopropoxide, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). A small amount
of triflic acid was used to initiate THF polymerization. The calcination
of the resulting gel at 500 °C produced a Sn–Ti bimetallic
nanocomposite. This newly synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV–visible
spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies were performed
for the first time using Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 coated over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)
under simulated 1 sun solar radiation. The chronoamperometric study
of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2/FTO revealed the repeatable and substantially higher photocurrent
for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) when compared to only TiO2. Moreover, the synthesized material exhibited high stability
both in the presence and absence of light. The photocatalytic studies
suggested that the sol–gel-synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 can be efficiently used
as a photoanode in the water-splitting reaction.

1 Introduction
Nanomaterials
represent highly privileged class of advanced materials,
which become increasingly important1,2 in a diverse
range of fields such as energy, catalysis, sensing, drug delivery,
and painting technology.3 Although the
number of such materials is literarily unknown, still the development
of novel and cost-effective new materials for valued application is
highly desired. In particular, the preparation of low-cost nanocomposite
materials continues to be a major challenge and is crucial for the
advancement of chemical processes related to academic research and
industrial production.4−6 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is among
the most promising approaches in artificial photosynthesis and a potential
alternative of fossil fuels. PEC splitting of water was first reported
by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 using TiO2 as a catalyst.7−9 Since then, a tremendous amount of work has been reported on PEC
water splitting with several nanocomposite catalysts. PEC water splitting
utilizes a semiconducting photocathode for H2 evolution
(HER) and/or a photoanode for O2 evolution (OER) reactions,
making it a convenient way to convert solar energy into renewable
fuels that can be easily transferred and transported.10 Among these two reactions, OER is more challenging as it
requires 4 moles of electrons per one mole of oxygen produced. For
the development of commercially viable devices, one of the crucial
challenges is the design of a photoanode with higher efficiency and
stability. For water-splitting photocatalysts, one of the major challenges
is photocorrosion of the electrodes. Some of the photogenerated holes
and electrons do not participate in the oxidation/reduction of water
and instead initiate the decomposition of the electrode itself.11

One of the most commonly applied photoactive
materials is titanium
dioxide; it got attention due to its chemical inertness, photostability,
nontoxicity, and cost-effectiveness. However, the higher band gap
of TiO2 puts a limitation on its PEC application. Due to
its high band gap, it absorbs sunlight only in the ultraviolet (UV)
region. Natural light consists of just a small portion of UV light
(4–5%), while the visible region ranging from 400 to 800 nm
is the major part of sunlight.12,13 The photocatalytic
effect generated by absorption of the photon results in the creation
of the hole–electron (h+/e–) pairs.14 The anatase TiO2 upon exposure to
the UV light produces a good photoresponse.15 However, nonmodified anatase TiO2 absorbs only a small
fraction of light for the h+/e– pair
generation, and also, recombination of h+/e– pairs is fast. Overall, the TiO2 thin-film photoelectrode’s
low photocurrent might be due to the lethargic electrons’ movement
to the rear of the electrodes, recombination of electron and hole
pairs, and poor electrical conductivity.16

More recently, a number of other materials including WO3, Fe2O3, CuWO4, BiVO4, and SnO2 have been used as photoanodes.17−25 However, the photochemical efficiency of the individual aforementioned
semiconductors is low because of fast charge recombination occurring
at the interface and surface, leading to low charge transfer and thus
lowering the energy conversion.

Among various metallic oxides,
the SnO2 can be proven
as an excellent photoanode material due to its promising features
of low cost, intrinsic stability, excellent charge mobility (100–200
cm2 V–1 s–1), and high
electron transfer efficiency.26 However,
pure SnO2-based photoanodes exhibit low photocatalytic
activity even under UV light because of the small surface to volume
ratio, low light capture efficiency, and a large band gap. To address
these issues, different semiconducting materials with large surface
areas such as nanosheets, nanowires, and nanotubes have been used
as a photoanode to improve the light-harvesting ability and active
surface area for the electrochemical reaction. The porous anodic tin
oxide films fabricated by the Sn anodization and annealing have displayed
better PEC performance in the visible region.27 As discussed, the SnO2 possessed better conductivity,
nearly two orders of magnitude compared to pure TiO2.27 The combination of SnO2 with other
nanomaterials displays different band gaps or Fermi levels, which
can improve the PEC performance of the composite material. The SnO2 and TiO2 bilayer structures were used to develop
effective heterojunction photoelectrodes.17 Similarly, a lot of efforts have been made on the modification of
semiconductors such as TiO2 to improve their PEC behavior
either by impurity doping or semiconductor coupling.28,29

Recently, numerous heterostructured semiconductor–TiO2 thin films including CdS·TiO2,30−32 ZnO·TiO2,33,34 FeS2·TiO2,35 and SnO2·TiO236 have been developed as photoelectrodes.
Among these doped nanocomposites, the Sn- or SnO2-doped
TiO2 is getting great attention in photocatalysis.37,38 This system is widely being explored to improve the PEC behavior
of hybrid materials for enhanced water splitting. The doping of Sn2+ or Sn+4 is receiving consideration especially
for TiO2 as a small mismatch in the lattice of the TiO2 and SnO2 provides good structural stability and
compatibility. Sn doping in TiO2 is considered more effective
compared to the other dopings due to the rough similarities of the
Sn+4 (0.690 Å) and Ti+4 (0.605 Å).39,40 At the interface, the mixed cation nanocomposite SnxTi1–XO2 can facilitate the excitation by modulating the electronic properties
and thus provide a better charge separation.41 SnO2 and TiO2 features are different as SnO2 has greater electron mobility and its conduction band is
lower than TiO2.42 A combination
of SnO2 and TiO2 imparts unique characteristics
to the hybrid material. These electronic properties of SnO2·TiO2 hybrid heterojunction can allow the photogenerated
electrons in the TiO2 conduction band migrate to SnO2, while photogenerated holes in the SnO2 valence
band migrate to the TiO2.43 Various
chemical routes are being adopted for tin doping into TiO2 to enhance the photoactivity of the composite.36,44 Ti1 – xSnxO2 nanocrystalline materials were synthesized
by Fresno et al. in which Sn4+ doping was reported with
both anatase and rutile phases of TiO2. It was observed
that the presence of Sn4+ changes the structural and electronic
properties. Ti1–xSnxO2 nanocrystals showed better photocatalytic
activity for oxidative decomposition of oxidation of methylcyclohexane
dye.45 Chua et al. reported the synthesis
of thin films of anatase TiO2 with 3.4% Sn4+ doping through aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Sn4+-doped anatase displayed 10% enhanced photocatalytic efficiency
for stearic acid degradation owing to the decreased rate of electron–hole
recombination.46 Arunachalam et al. synthesized
Sn4+-doped TiO2 porous indium tin oxide electrodes
by spray pyrolysis and showed that Sn4+-doped TiO2 electrodes showed better photocatalytic activities with a decreased
band gap.47 Chandra et al. synthesized
polythiophene over Sn4+-doped TiO2 and studied
that polythiophene performed better for LPG sensitivity due to better
photocatalytic activity of Sn4+-doped TiO2.48 In this work, we report on the synthesis of
a bimetallic Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 nanocomposite using a facile and more convenient sol–gel
method and for the first time reported its PEC activity for the OER
reaction.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural
Characterization and Morphological
Studies of the Sn–Ti Nanocomposite
Figure 1 presents the pXRD diffraction
pattern of Sn0.39Ti0.61O2.TiO2, which was characterized by ICDD-BD card no. 01-076-8392
for tin–titanium (Sn0.39Ti0.61O2) and ICDD-BD card no. 01-075-2544 for titania (TiO2)
in anatase form. The ratio between Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 and TiO2 was found to be 82.5 and 17.5%
by a relative intensity ratio (RIR) analysis method (Figure S1). The TiO2 anatase displayed its characteristics
XRD peaks (Figure 1A) at 25.5° (101), 38.3° (004), 48.3° (200), 54.1°
(105), 55.4° (211), 63.1° (204), 69.1° (116), 70.6°
(220), and 74.5° (215).49 Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 was characterized by major peaks present
at 26.8° (110), 34.5° (101), and 52.8° (211), while
Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 was characterized by peaks at 25.3°, 38.3°, and 47.9°
(Figure 1B). All other
small peaks also belonged to either Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 or anatase TiO2. The crystallite size calculated
by the Debye–Scherer method for Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 ranged from 8–11 nm, while for anatase TiO2, it was found in between 9–14 nm. The synthesized
photoactive composite Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 has displayed small-sized nanoparticles compared to the anatase
TiO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, it is evident from the
substantial reduction of the XRD peak intensity of the photoactive
composite Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 compared
to the XRD spectrum of the anatase TiO2.

Sn-doped titanium oxide was further investigated by XPS spectroscopy
to get the information of bonding composition. The survey scan XPS
spectra of the synthesized material revealed the various electronic
orbital signatures of Ti 2p3/2, 1/2, Sn 3d5/2, 3/2 O 1s, and C 1s (Figure 2). The carbon signal might be due to residual C produced during
calcination. The binding energy of the C 1s main peak was adjusted
to 284.8 eV for compensating sample charging, and all other peaks
were corrected accordingly (Figure S2).
The well resolved two characteristics peaks Ti2p3/2 and
Ti2p1/2 and Sn3d5/2 and Sn3d3/2 were
observed in the XPS spectra. XPS spectra (Figure 2b) demonstrate two distinguish peaks of the
Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 at 486.668 and 495.190 eV,
respectively. The binding energy difference between two peaks of Sn
was 8.522 eV. Typically, in the XPS spectra of Ti 2p, peaks appear
at 458.6 eV (2p3/2)and 464.4 eV (2p1/2). As presented in Figure 2c, the doping of Sn into TiO2 imparted a blueshift
at 464.686 eV. The blueshift in the binding energy was 0.404 eV and
0.286 eV, respectively. This change in binding energy was an indication
of successful doping of Sn atoms into the TiO2 instead
of just being present at the surface. In Sn-doped TiO2,
the O 1s spectra’s prominent peak appeared at 532.274 eV. However,
O 1s spectra also revealed another peak at 530.624 eV, which indicated
the presence of two types of O present in the nanocomposite (Figure S3).

resolution (b) Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, (c) Ti
2p3/2 and Ti
2p1/2 states.

The surface morphology
of the synthesized tin-doped titanium oxide
composite was revealed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM). SEM images were evaluated at different magnifications as
shown by Figure 3a,b.
It was clearly observed that the tin-doped titanium oxide composite
demonstrated the flake-like morphology with varying sizes and thicknesses.

images of the synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2.TiO2 composite at different magnifications:
(a) 500 μm and (b) 2 μm. The composite Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 emerged as flakes
of varying thicknesses.

Energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) study was performed
to confirm the elemental existence of the synthesized tin-doped titanium
oxide nanocomposite as shown in Figure S4. EDX mapping study of the synthesized composite demonstrates the
uniform distribution of the Sn in the TiO2 (Figure S4a). The uniform distribution of the
Sn, Ti, and O can be seen in Figure S4b–d, indicating the equal ratio of elements in the composite lattice.
The mapping of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2.TiO2 also revealed that the Sn is successfully incorporated
into the TiO2. No data was found for the impurity elements,
which proved the pure preparation of the tin-doped titanium oxide
nanocomposite. The EDX spectrum (Figure S4e) revealed the presence of Sn, Ti, and O in the synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 flakes.
Elemental analysis and EDX elemental mapping images show comparable
results. ICP elemental mapping analysis shows 40.8% Sn and 16.9% Ti,
while EDX shows 39.6% Sn and 16.8% Ti. FESEM examination, EDX mapping,
and EDS elemental results altogether confirmed the successful preparation
of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 composite via a sol–gel route.

Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to evaluate
the surface morphology and structure of synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 flakes at high
resolution. Figure 4 shows the TEM image of one of the tin-based titanium oxide flakes
along with the electron diffraction pattern. It was clear that the
composite was showing flake-like morphology with almost a uniform
thickness as judged by the same contrast. The TEM image further revealed
that the flake consisted of smaller particles in the range of 10–20
nm. The particle size of 10–20 nm and crystallite size calculated
from pXRD demonstrated that particles consisted of 1–2 crystallites.
These nanoparticles collected together and consequently shaped the
flake-like morphology. These nanoflakes displayed the crystalline
nature when selected-area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) was
recorded from the flake region (Figure 4b). The SAED pattern showed the ring patterns where
each ring was indexed as (started from the inner ring) 110, 101, 211,
022, etc. in agreement with XRD data.

the SAED pattern. The
nanocomposite composed of individual particles in the range of 10–20
nm. (b) SAED pattern displaying the crystalline structure of the composite.
The major reflections are indexed as 110, 101, 211, and 022.

The Brunaur–Emmet–Teller (BET) method
was used to
determine the surface area, size of pores, and their distribution.
The BET surface area found was 120 m2/g with an average
pore diameter of 8.28 nm, and a pore volume of 0.000915 cm3/g was obtained. These results are comparable to the high-surface-area
anatase reported in the literature.50,51 See Figure S6.

2.2 UV–Visible
Study of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 Composite
The synthesized photoactive material was
further investigated by
UV–visible spectroscopy. The analysis of UV–visible
spectroscopy facilitates the band gap energy estimation of Sn-doped
TiO2. For UV–visible analysis, the material was
scanned from 200 to 800 nm. The synthesized material demonstrated
an absorbance from 550 to 200 nm. The absorbance capability was enhanced
as λ was moving from 550 to 200 nm (Figure 5a). From the absorbance curve, the cut off
wavelength was found at 395 nm. The band gap energy calculated using eq 1 was 3.14 eV. Furthermore,
the band gap energy calculation was done using diffused reflectance
spectroscopy (Figure 5b). The band gap energy was further verified by using the Tauc equation
and Kubelka–Munk equation.52 The
band gap value was calculated at about 3.11 eV. This value is very
close to the UV–visible calculated value of 3.14 eV. This band
gap was slightly lower than the band gap of pure TiO2 (∼3.2
eV).

plot from diffused spectra of Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 for calculation of the band gap.

2.3 PEC Investigation of the
Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 Composite
For PEC investigation of the synthesized material,
the FTO electrode
was drop-casted with the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 as a thin film at the surface of the electrode.
The PEC behavior of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2/FTO electrode was explored under 1 sun solar
simulator light presence and absence by dipping in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. First of all, the LSV was scanned
by switching on and off the light simulator, and it was found that
the current was enhanced significantly under light and returned back
to the background value as the light was turned off. This behavior
of the material revealed that Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 was photosensitive (Figure 6).

Figure 6 LSV curve recorded with
the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2/FTO electrode for the OER reaction under
chopping light mode.

The background current
was also enhanced as the potential was increased
beyond 0.5 V. Chronoamperometry was applied to observe the reproducibility
and stability of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2/FTO electrode for OER. In chronoamperometry,
the current density (J) was recorded at a specific
time interval by controlling the on/off mode of the light simulator. The sharp spike of
the current was observed as the light was switched on, and after a
certain time, the current was leveled off. The photocurrent was increased
to 210 μA from about 0 μA when the light was turned on,
indicating that the OER started when the light struck the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 surface. The
photoanodic current density was sharply decreased, close to the background
current, when the light was turned off (Figure 7a). However, under the same set of conditions,
TiO2 anatase/FTO has displayed a poor photoelectrochemical
response. The maximum current displayed by the TiO2 anatase/FTO
photoelectrode under light was 0.05 μA (Figure S5), which was extremely lower compared to the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2.TiO2/FTO electrode
photocurrent (210 μA) for OER. The photoelectrochemical analysis
of the TiO2 anatase/FTO and Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2/FTO electrodes have revealed that
the resultant composite (Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2), by doping of the Sn into TiO2,
has substantially improved the photoelectrochemical performance of
the photoelectrode. This behavior of the Sn-doped TiO2 demonstrated
that this nanocomposite is highly sensitive toward light.

Figure 7 . (a) Chronoamperometery in light chopping mode and
(b) stability of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2/FTO response for the OER reaction under dark
and light.

The stability of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2/FTO photoanode
was also tested under dark and
under 1 sunlight illumination as displayed in Figure 7b. The dark current was very stable, while
only a slight reduction in photocurrent was observed over more than
30 min of testing time due to O2 evolution and accumulation
of O2 bubbles at the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2/FTO surface.

2.4 Possible Mechanism of OER on the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 Photoanode
The doping
of Sn into TiO2 has provided a better charge
separation in the photoactive material. The interface of the TiO2 and SnO2 facilitates the separation of the hole
and electrons by providing the alternate positions for them. The mechanism
of the charge separation at the interface of TiO2/SnO2 was proposed in Figure 8. The band gap of SnO2 is wider than TiO2. However, it is interesting that the
conduction band (CB) of the SnO2 appeared lower than the
conduction band of TiO2. Similarly, the valence band (VB)
of the TiO2 appeared above the VB of the SnO2. As the light radiations strike on the interface of the TiO2/SnO2, the holes generated during the active state
started to migrate from the VB of SnO2 to TiO2. Similarly, the electrons moved from the CB of TiO2 to
SnO2 during the excitation state. This phenomenon has provided
the effective separation of the electron–hole pair and increased
the lifetime by suppressing their recombination (Figure 8). This is according to the
literature that the potential difference among SnO2 and
TiO2 permitted the facile migration of photoelectrons from
the TiO2 to SnO2 CB.53 Moreover, the mixed cation composition Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 accelerates the exciton generation
and separation, which enhanced the photocurrent.

reaction on the photoanode Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2-coated FTO.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Characterization
of the Nanocomposite
The XRD patterns were recorded using
a Smart Lab X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku, Japan) with Cu-Kα X-ray radiations (λ = 0.15406
nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with an
ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Scientific, UK instrument. The adventitious
carbon peak that appeared at a binding energy of 284.8 eV was used
as a reference. A UV/vis–NIR spectrometer by “Agilent
Cary series” was used for determination of optical properties.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS)
analysis were carried out by a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM; Tescan Lyra-3) equipped with a focused ion beam (FIB) and
energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) detector. The TEM analysis of
the synthesized composite was performed using a transmission electron
microscope (TEM; FEI, Morgagni 268, Czech Republic). Selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in TEM were recorded to evaluate
the structure of the nanocomposite and confirm the XRD data. A TEM
sample was dispersed in ethanol and deposited onto a Cu grid holding
a holey carbon film. SEM and TEM instruments were operated at working
potentials of 20 and 80 kV, respectively. For surface area determination,
a Micromeritics (ASAP model) BET analyzer (Micromeritics Headquarters,
4356 Communications Drive, Norcross, GA 30093-2901, U.S.) was used.
Before the measurement of surface area, the sample was kept under
N2 flow at 250 °C for 5 h to remove moisture and other
adsorbed gases. Then N2 adsorption/desorption was performed
at 77 K using a liquid nitrogen bath.

3.2 Optical
Band Gap Determination
The
band gap energy was calculated using the following equation 1  where E is
the band gap energy (eV), h is Planck’s constant
(6.626 × 10–34 J/s), C is
the light speed (3.0 × 108 m/s), and λ is the
cut off wavelength (nm). Furthermore, the band energy calculation
was done using diffused reflectance spectroscopy (Figure 5b). The band gap energy was
further verified by using the Tauc equation and Kubelka–Munk
equation.52 The following Tauc equation
(eq 2) was used for the
calculation of the band gap energy 2  where α is the absorption
coefficient, h represents Planck’s constant, A is a constant, ν represents the frequency, Eg represents the band gap, and the n value
is 1/2 for the direct allowed transition.

The Kubelka–Munk equation (eq 3) was used for the calculation of the absorption coefficient
(α) by using the diffuse reflectance. 3  

In eq 3, R represents the absolute reflectance, s represents
the scattering coefficient, and k represents the
molar absorption coefficient. The Kubelka–Munk function F(R) was calculated by using the assimilated
diffuse reflectance spectrum that was equivalent to the absorption
coefficient (α). The obtained quantity [F(R)hν] 0.5 was plotted against the
photon energy (hν) to obtain the band gap energy.
The linear part of the curve was extended to obtain the band gap value.

3.3 Synthesis of Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2
Tin chloride, titanium
isopropoxide, triflic acid (TFC), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any purification. The detailed
synthesis procedure of Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 along several other new nanocomposites has
been reported recently.54 Briefly, tin(IV)
chloride and titanium isopropoxide as precursors for the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 composite were
added to 25 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), and polymerization of THF
was initiated by adding 0.5 mL of triflic acid (TFC) as shown in the
equation. In a 50 mL round-bottom flask, tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate
(0.01 M, 0.043 mL) and titanium isopropoxide (0.01 M, 3.03 mL) were
mixed in 25 mL of THF at 25 °C. Then, 0.5 mL of TFC was added
to initiate the polymerization of THF. Slow polymerization of THF
was allowed to occur with constant stirring at 25 °C for 4 h.
After the formation of polymeric gel, whole reaction products were
transferred to a crucible and placed in a furnace. The calcination
was performed by raising the temperature to 500 °C at a rate
of 4 °C per min and held there for 2 h. After pyrolysis, the
catalytic material was cooled to room temperature and stored in glass
vials.

3.4 PEC Studies of the Nanocomposite
The PEC measurements were carried out by a conventional three-electrode
system in 1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 7) as a supporting
electrolyte. The working electrode was an FTO glass coated with 200
μL of 2% nafion suspension of the composite Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2; Pt gauze served
as an auxiliary electrode and the standard Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl as a reference
electrode (SCE). All the PEC experiments were performed using a Metrohm
Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N) instrument. For solar light in the
laboratory, an Oriel Sol3A class AAA solar simulator (Newport) with
the following specifications were used: power of 100 mW cm–2 (1 sun), IEC/JIS/ASTM-certified, containing a 450 W xenon lamp,
Air Mass 1.5G Filter, UV cut off the filter and 2 × 2 in aperture
for output beam.

4 Conclusions
A new
sol–gel method is introduced for the synthesis of
the photoactive catalyst for PEC splitting of water. The Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 catalyst was
synthesized by utilizing the acid-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization
of THF. The attractive features of the synthetic route of the catalyst
are its simple methodology and a potential to synthesize several other
nanocomposite materials. The Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 was characterized using SEM, TEM, EDX,
XRD, UV–visible spectroscopy, voltammetry, and chronoamperometry.
The structure characterization confirmed the formation of Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 with successful
doping of Sn+4 into TiO2. The combination of
the VB and CB of the SnO2 and the TiO2 in the
nanocomposite provided a heterojunction displaying a great capability
to harvest natural light for efficient splitting of water. The Sn0.39Ti0.61O2·TiO2 demonstrated
good stability under both light and dark conditions. This material
may prove to be a good addition as a photoanode for PEC water splitting.
