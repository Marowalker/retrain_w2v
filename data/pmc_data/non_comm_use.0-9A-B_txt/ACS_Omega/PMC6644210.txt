Synthesis of most
tin-based bimetallic nanoparticles is a challenging
task because of the differences in the redox potential and the melting
point between both components. This article presents a co-reduction
synthesis of monoclinic Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles.
Varying time and temperature gives the possibility to control the
size of the nanoparticles in the range of 4–12 nm. The products
were characterized by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy measurements. Although the synthesis was conducted
entirely oxygen free, the postsynthetic treatment undertaken under
air leads to the formation of an amorphous oxide shell. The oxide
shell consists of an outer tin-rich region and a nickel-rich region
at the interface to the metallic Ni3Sn4 core.
On the basis of the investigation of the particles at different stages
of the synthesis, we propose a growth mechanism for the Ni3Sn4 nanocrystals. These results can be a guidepost for
the synthesis of other tin-based bimetallic nanoparticles.

Introduction
Metallic and especially
bimetallic nanomaterials exhibit properties
that are interesting for application in optical, catalytic, or electronic
devices.1−5 The main challenge in the synthesis of these materials arises from
differences in such properties as the melting point or the redox potentials
of both metals. It is problematic to find reaction conditions under
which two metals with different properties can be simultaneously reduced
to form bimetallic nuclei or to ensure the further uniform growth
of the particles. Tin-based bimetallic nanoparticles always deal with
high differences regarding the melting point caused by the extraordinary
low melting point of tin (232 °C).6−13 One promising intermetallic compound is the combination of tin and
nickel, which leads to three stable Ni–Sn phases (Ni3Sn, Ni3Sn2, and Ni3Sn4) in accordance with the phase diagram.14 The nickel–tin compounds are highly interesting for the application
as anode material in lithium-ion batteries, where they could replace
the currently used graphite anode, yielding higher specific capacities
or as catalysts in acetylene hydrogenation.15 The controlled production of one of the crystalline Ni–Sn
phases involves many challenges. High-energy ball milling often leads
to additional phases like tin oxide and mixtures of Ni–Sn phases.16−20 However, the ball-milling technique lacks the control of size, shape,
and crystal structure of the produced material, needed for most of
the applications of such materials.21 Deposition
methods such as electrochemical or sputtering deposition deal with
similar difficulties.22−26 Colloidal synthesis starting with metal salts is an interesting
approach to overcome these issues. Reduction of metal salts with sodium
borohydride leads to polydisperse crystalline nanoparticles in a size
range from 5 to 50 nm but with mixed phases of tin oxides and Ni–Sn
phases like Ni3Sn2 and Ni3Sn.27−29 Dong et al. used KBH4 as a reducing agent and obtained
amorphous micrometer particles containing Ni and Sn in a ratio of
3:4.30 Depending on the initial weights
of the metal salts, Antonin et al. synthesized Ni–Sn samples
containing all three Ni–Sn phase compositions (Ni3Sn, Ni3Sn2, and Ni3Sn4) with side products of NiO and SnO2 in a size range <10
nm.31 Therefore, the wet chemical synthesis
is a useful approach to gain more control of the size of the particles
but still synthesizing single-crystalline phases is not easy to achieve.
Applying tin templates as a starting material is a promising approach
because it allows high control of size, shape, and crystal structure;
however, it is always limited by the possibility to synthesize the
appropriate templates. Chou and Schaak synthesized hollow single-crystalline
Ni3Sn4 nanorods with tin nanorods as templates
and cube-shaped NiSn3 nanocrystals, starting with spherical
tin nanoparticles.32,33 Watanabe et al. obtained Ni3Sn2 nanocubes with an averaged edge length of 15
nm using almost spherical tin nanoparticles.34 Wang et al. synthesized spherical Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles
with an average size of 40 nm; however, there is no information about
the templates in this study.6

Not
only the size and phase control of nanocrystalline Ni–Sn
phases require further investigation but also information about their
growth mechanism and detailed structure is still limited. Therefore,
in the current study, we developed a co-reduction synthesis, leading
to the formation of single-crystalline, colloidal Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles, with size controllable in a range between
4 and 12 nm. We investigated the size and shape of the nanoparticles
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the crystal structure by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the composition within the nanoparticle
with high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements.
On the basis of this information we could propose a detailed model
of the synthesized nanoparticles. In addition to that, we analyzed
the influence of reaction time and reaction temperature on the growth
of the nanoparticles, which gave us insight into the formation and
growth mechanism of Ni3Sn4 particles in colloidal
solution.

Results and Discussion
Colloidal single-crystalline
Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles
were synthesized via a hot injection of the reducing agent at 230
°C. Metal chlorides were used as a metal source, whereas oleylamine
acted as a solvent and at the same time as a ligand for the emerging
nanoparticles, keeping them from agglomeration. To prevent any side
reactions before the reduction, the solution must be free of water
and oxygen, which is achieved by evacuating the setup. Before reducing
the metal ions, addition of lithium-bis(trimethylsilyl)amide induces
the formation of metal–oleylamine precursors.21,35 To obtain Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles with a narrow
size distribution, the solution was held at 230 °C for 21 h.
Traces of agglomerates were sorted out via centrifugation.

The
size and shape of the synthesized nanoparticles were determined
by TEM, and their crystallographic structure and phase composition
by XRD, HRTEM, and XPS.

In Figure 1, a representative
TEM image of the particles is shown together with the corresponding
size distribution. The nanoparticles are all uniform and quasispherical,
with a mean diameter of 3.7 ± 0.6 nm.

Figure 1 (a) TEM image of quasispherical
nanoparticles synthesized at 230
°C for 21 h with (b) the corresponding size distribution. The
mean and standard deviation of the nanoparticles’ diameter
is 3.7 ± 0.6 nm.

In Figure 2, the
resulting X-ray diffraction pattern is plotted. Because of the substantial
broadening of the peaks, a Rietveld analysis was conducted to get
information about the crystal structure parameters and the size of
the particles. We started the refinement with the monoclinic Ni3Sn4 structure (ICSD, PDF: 04-007-1116). After refinement
of the particle size, strain, and the lattice parameters, as well
as the atomic positions (see Table 1), we achieved a good agreement between the experimental
and computed pattern (blue and green line in Figure 2, respectively).

the diffraction pattern with the Ni3Sn4 crystal
structure (ICSD, PDF: 04-007-1116). No additional
phase is observed.

 	Sn2	0.203(1)	0	0.760(1)	
Thus, we can rule out the presence
of additional crystalline phases
in this sample. To compare the particle size obtained by TEM measurements
with the results from Rietveld analysis, a volume-weighted mean diameter D4,3(36,37) has to be calculated
from TEM data (4.2 nm for this sample). In comparison with 2.5 nm,
the particle diameter received from Rietveld analysis, there is a
distinct difference in size not explainable by the fit quality. In
fact, the assumption of an amorphous oxide shell surrounding the nanoparticles
would explain the low diameter obtained from the Rietveld analysis.
Regarding the galvanic series, it is expected that both metals are
easy to oxidize. Thus, the formation of an oxidized shell is likely
in contact with the atmosphere, whose exact composition needs to be
investigated.

For further information about the crystal structure
and composition,
HRTEM combined with EDX measurements was performed. In Figure 3, an ensemble of nanoparticles
is shown and most of them show lattice fringes, indicating their crystalline
character. To identify the lattice plane distances and the related
crystal structure, a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of the red
marked particle was performed. The nanoparticle is oriented in [13̅1]
direction, and all diffraction spots can be assigned to the same monoclinic
Ni3Sn4 crystal structure used for the Rietveld
analysis, substantiating the single-crystalline nature of the nanoparticles.
A distinct amorphous shell surrounding the nanoparticle is not clearly
visible, which can be explained by the lower contrast of an oxidized
species against the crystalline metallic core. Hence, further investigation
is needed.

Figure 3 (a) HRTEM image of crystalline nanoparticles after 21 h of reaction
time. The corresponding (b) FFT image of the red marked area can be
assigned to the lattice plane distances and the corresponding angles
of the Ni3Sn4 phase.

Spatially resolved EDX measurements give the first hint at
the
detailed composition of the nanoparticles. In Figure 4, element-specific mappings over an ensemble
of nanoparticles are shown. The elemental distribution of tin is more
spread out than that of nickel, indicating a tin-rich oxide shell,
which is unexpected due to the lower standard electrode potential
of nickel.

(b) the nickel signal, (c) the tin signal, and (d) the combination
of both signals.

To examine the shell
in more detail, XPS measurements combined
with low-energy sputter etching using argon clusters were conducted.
XPS measurements are particularly suitable to characterize the surface
of the nanoparticles and give information about the composition of
the interior of the particle. The XP survey spectra and XP spectra
of the Ni 2p and Sn 3d signals before and after the etching procedure
are shown in Figure 5. All signals in the survey spectra can be explained by the presence
of Ni, Sn, O, and C in the sample. Small Si-related features in the
initial survey spectrum can be explained by the Si-containing lithium
base used in the synthesis. The Sn 3d signal was fitted using two
doublet signals with a spin–orbit splitting of 8.4 ± 0.1
eV and a ratio of both doublet signal intensities of 0.67 (Figure S1a). The best fit was achieved using
three species, a metallic one and two oxidized species, which can
be explained by the presence of Sn(II) and Sn(IV) in the nanoparticles’
oxide shell.38 The asymmetry of the metallic
signal was considered. The binding energies for the three species
are EB(Sn0) = 484.4 ±
0.1 eV, EB(SnII) = 485.9 ±
0.2 eV, and EB(SnIV) = 486.5
± 0.1 eV. The values for the oxidized species are in good agreement
with the literature. The binding energy of the metallic species is
around 0.4 eV lower than the literature value for metallic Sn. This
can be explained by the fact that the Sn0 is present in
the form of a Ni3Sn4 compound. From the Ni 2p
signal, only the Ni 2p3/2 part was fitted (Figure S1b). The metallic species dominates the
Ni signal at the end of the sputtering procedure. The additional features
that are observed at the beginning of the etching are explained by
oxidized Ni species present in the nanoparticles’ oxide shell.
The metallic species was fitted with an asymmetric signal. The binding
energy EB(Ni0) = 852.5 ±
0.1 eV is in good agreement with the literature. No significant shift
of the binding energy is observed due to the alloying with Sn according
to the literature. Two satellites at energies 3.7 ± 0.2 and 6.0
± 0.2 eV above the metal main peak and with a signal intensity
between 5 and 15% of the main metallic signal were observed according
to the literature. This information was used to better fit the spectra
with superimposing features of the metallic and the oxidized Ni species.
It is known that the XPS signals of oxidized Ni species are shaped
by (often unresolved) multiplet splitting. Often this results in a
rather broad enveloping peak.39,40 To estimate the signal
intensity and thus the atomic fraction of oxidized Ni, we used one
broad signal and one satellite, yielding a good fitting of the data.
It has to be pointed out that Ni is known to be reduced by argon sputtering.41,42 Therefore, we used the total amount of Ni species for further analysis.

Figure 5 Comparison
of XP spectra before and after the etching procedure
of (a) the survey spectra, (b) the Sn 3d signals, and (c) the Ni 2p
signals.

In Figure 6, the
intensities, normalized on each species’ maximum value are
plotted as a function of the sputtering time for the XPS signals of
C, Ni, and Sn. The carbon signal decreases with a high slope at the
beginning of the etching procedure and is almost steady after 3000
s. This behavior indicates a fast degradation of the organic layer
surrounding the nanoparticles. Comparing the gradient of different
signals can give a hint of the location of the elements within the
nanoparticles. On the basis of the fitted XPS signal for Sn, the evolution
of the oxidized and metallic species are plotted separately. Because
of the reduction of metallic Ni by argon sputtering, a separation
of the metallic and oxidized Ni species does not yield reliable results
and was, consequently, not conducted.42,43

Figure 6 Overview of
normalized intensities during the sputtering procedure
for selected species. The Sn signal is divided into a metallic (Sn0) and oxidized species (Snx+).
The Ni signal is divided into the summed signal and a nickel signal
(Niotc “outside the core”) resulting from
the assumption of a stoichiometric Ni3Sn4 core.
Lines are a guide for the eye.

Assuming a perfect Ni3Sn4 crystal,
the gradients
of the Sn and Ni signal would be identical, which is not the case
here. The increase of the Sn signal is significantly higher than that
of the Ni signal, indicating an inhomogeneous distribution of both
elements in the nanoparticles, with a Sn-rich surface. The difference
between the slope of the oxidized and metallic Sn species is in line
with an oxidic shell and a metallic core of the nanoparticles. This
result is in good agreement with the HRTEM and EDX measurements in Figures 3 and 4. Furthermore, the intensity of oxidized Sn is slowly decreasing
after 1000 s of sputtering time, implying a slight degradation of
the oxide shell.

As mentioned before, the Ni signal cannot be
divided into oxidized
and metallic species without significant errors. Instead, we assume
that the metallic core consists of stoichiometric Ni3Sn4 and all metallic Sn signal results from that core. On the
basis of that idea and the atomic fractions of the species (Figure S2), the metallic Ni signal belonging
to the core of the nanoparticle can be calculated and subtracted from
the overall Ni signal (see the Supporting Information for details). The evolution of the remaining Ni signal is plotted
as Niotc (outside the core). Although the oxidation state
of this signal is not distinguishable, its evolution differs from
that of all tin signals, indicating a different distribution of Ni
compared to that of Sn outside the core with Ni predominantly in the
inner region of the shell.

Summing up all information received
by TEM, XRD, HRTEM, EDX, and
XPS, a detailed model of the synthesized nanoparticles is sketched
in Figure 7. The nanoparticles
have core–shell geometry with a monoclinic Ni3Sn4 core and an amorphous shell. The shell itself contains an
irregular distribution of both elements Sn and Ni, presumably oxidized.
Regarding the galvanic series, nickel atoms are easier to oxidize
than tin atoms. Therefore, it is surprising that the fraction of Sn
is higher near the surface and that Ni is located near the interface
of the core and the shell. Within the Ni3Sn4 crystal structure, tin atoms are more weakly bound than the nickel
atoms, resulting in a higher diffusion rate reflected by the big difference
of the melting temperature between tin (232 °C) and nickel (1455
°C).44 Consequently, using tin in
intermetallic nanoparticles can prevent the less noble metal from
oxidation.

Figure 7 Schema of the synthesized nanoparticles regarding the element distribution.
For visualization reasons, the thickness of the oxide shell is overestimated.

To focus more on the growth mechanism
of the nanoparticles, we
stopped the synthesis after 1 and 5 h at 230 °C, obtaining nanoparticles
shown in Figure 8.
In comparison to the first sample held at 230 °C for 21 h, there
are some larger nanoparticles surrounded by many smaller ones. The
corresponding size distribution is broadened, and due to the single
large particles, there is a not negligible fraction centered
at 10.5 nm, which decreases for the sample heated for 5 h at 230 °C
(Figure 8b). Thus,
more extended heating at 230 °C leads to a narrower size distribution
combined with a smaller mean diameter of the particles. Therefore,
no Ostwald ripening is observed at 230 °C but there is a disappearance
of the larger nanoparticles. This disappearance is unexpected since
smaller particles tend to dissolve more readily in a colloidal solution
because of the high surface tension. In addition to that, after 5
h, at 230 °C, we observed the formation of a small fraction of
aggregates, which was removed before TEM measurements by centrifugation.
The precipitate obtained from the synthesis conducted for 21 h contains
an additional β-Sn phase (see Figure S3). To clarify the origin and following disappearance of these larger
nanoparticles, we studied the differences in their structure and composition
by HRTEM and EDX.

Figure 8 TEM images and the corresponding size distribution of
nanoparticles
heated for (a) 1 h and (b) 5 h at 230 °C.

In Figure 9, an
HRTEM image of the sample with 1 h reaction time is shown. All nanoparticles,
regardless of their size, are crystalline and exhibit clearly visible
lattice fringes. The smaller nanoparticles are single crystalline
in contrast to the larger ones, which consist of more than one crystalline
domain. The single-crystalline nanoparticle in Figure 9b can be identified as Ni3Sn4 oriented in [13̅1] direction. The composition of the
polycrystalline nanoparticles was compared to the monocrystalline
ones by HRTEM–EDX measurements (Figure S4). The Sn content of the polycrystalline particles is twice
as high as the Ni content. Therefore, the larger nanoparticles differ
in the crystallinity and composition. We assume two different growth
paths for both kinds of particles (see below for the details of the
suggested growth mechanism).

Figure 9 (a) HRTEM image of nanoparticles heated for
1 h at 230 °C.
The large nanoparticle exhibits a polycrystalline structure, (b) HRTEM
image of a single-crystalline nanoparticle with (c) the corresponding
FFT. The lattice planes can be assigned to the Ni3Sn4 crystal structure.

Thus, the synthesis of Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles
can be channeled from a bimodal size distribution with a mixture of
single-crystalline nanoparticles and polycrystalline nanoparticles
to a narrow size distribution of only single-crystalline nanoparticles
by extending the duration of the reaction at 230 °C. A slight
effect of the nanoparticle growth can be observed but is still relatively
small taking the long reaction time of over 20 h into account. To
speed up the nanoparticle growth, we added a second temperature step
after nucleation at 230 °C. The samples were heated to 300 °C
for different durations between 1 and 24 h. All samples were characterized
regarding their size and crystallographic structure. The TEM images
are shown in Figure 10 for three selected reaction times.

Figure 10 TEM images of the resulting nanoparticles
after heating to 300
°C for (a) 1 h, (b) 4 h, and (c) 12 h and (d) the corresponding
size distribution. (e) HRTEM image after 12 h.

The nanoparticles remain quasispherical, but their mean diameter
changes after 1 h of heating at 300 °C to 5.2 ± 1.0 nm,
after 4 h to 8.7 ± 1.7 nm, and after 12 h to 12.2 ± 2.3
nm. Further heating (24 h) leads to the formation of large agglomerates,
not stable in colloidal solution (Figure S5e). The results of three more samples, obtained after 0, 2.5, and
8 h are summarized in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). The increasing diameter of the particles and the
standard deviation combined with an increase of time indicates Ostwald
ripening as the growth mechanism. To rule out the formation of additional
phases while heating the reaction solution to 300 °C, XRD measurements
were done. The normalized diffraction patterns are plotted in Figure 11 together with
the reference data for Ni3Sn4 and β-Sn
(AMCSD: 0011248). As expected, the broadening of the diffraction peaks
decreases with longer reaction times, indicating the presence of larger
crystallites within the samples. The sample heated for 24 h at 300
°C (Figure 12) consists of large agglomerates with a diameter of several hundred
nanometers and a negligible volume fraction of small nanoparticles.
In addition to that, the sample exhibits diffraction peaks, which
can be assigned to β-Sn and Ni2PSn (ICSD, PDF: 04-010-2577).
Apparently, high temperatures and long reaction times lead to a release
of phosphorus out of the solvent tributylphosphine.

Figure 11 XRD data of Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles for different
heating times at 300 °C.

Figure 12 Rietveld analysis of a sample heated for 24 h at 300 °C. Next
to the usual Ni3Sn4 phase, additional phases
of β-Sn and Ni2PSn are present and plotted separately
from the total Rietveld refinement.

To learn more about those phases and the phase composition,
Rietveld
analysis (Figure 12) was conducted. The ratio of the phases Ni3Sn4/β-Sn/Ni2PSn is about 4:1:1. The refined parameters
of the analysis can be found in the Supporting Information (Table S1). In contrast to the nanoparticles not
heated to 300 °C but held at 230 °C for 21 h, the unit cell
is barely distorted. The crystallite size of the β-Sn phase
is in the region of micrometers, followed by crystallites of more
than hundred nanometers for the Ni3Sn4 phase.
Only the Ni2PSn phase shows crystallite sizes in the nanometer
range of approximately 9 nm.

Taking all of the above information
into account, a growth mechanism
can be postulated and is sketched in Figure 13. We assume the formation of liquid tin-rich
nuclei owing to the higher standard electrode potential of tin.45,46The fact that nickel nanoparticles did not form in reactions conducted
without a tin source supports this theory (results not shown here
for brevity). The liquid nuclei can easily aggregate during collisions
in the reaction solution, which leads to the formation of a small
fraction of larger particles (Figure 8). Both the nuclei and the larger particles react with
Ni monomers. However, assuming a diffusion-controlled reaction, in
which each particle reacts with the same amount of Ni monomers, regardless
of its size, the fraction of Ni increases faster in the small particles.
Thus, smaller nanoparticles more quickly reach the stoichiometric
ratio of Ni3Sn4. Meanwhile, their melting point
changes from 232 °C (Sn) to higher values up to 795 °C (Ni3Sn4), resulting in a liquid–solid phase
transition. Thus, further collisions of these particles are not likely
to result in new aggregation. Heating to higher temperatures leads
to further growth by Ostwald ripening for the Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles and agglomeration of the tin-rich particles,
which still might contain some liquid regions. Hence, the pure Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles can be separated from the byproducts
of the reaction by centrifugation. During purification, the nanoparticle
dispersion is exposed to the atmosphere, resulting in the formation
of an oxidized shell, which could be avoided by working under an inert
gas atmosphere.

Conclusions
In
this work, we developed a colloidal synthesis of Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles with high control of the phase composition
and size. We used TEM, HRTEM, XRD, EDX, and XPS to characterize the
monoclinic crystal structure, the different sizes of the nanoparticles,
and the formation of the oxide shell. We showed that the nanoparticles
with almost 4 nm size reveal a distorted unit cell, which recovers
after treatment at 300 °C, forming larger nanoparticles up to
12 nm. An additional Ni2PSn phase can be observed after
24 h caused by the decomposition of one of the solvents. At lower
temperatures, the synthesis can easily be modified to eliminate nanoparticles
with a different phase composition than that of Ni3Sn4. Exposing the nanoparticles to the air causes the formation
of an oxide shell with a high Sn concentration at the surface, protecting
nickel from oxidation. Using all given information, we proposed a
growth mechanism for this synthesis, demonstrating the essential steps
from nucleation over Ostwald ripening to the stable nanoparticle.
In general, the simultaneous reduction of nickel and tin can be performed
successfully although the redox potentials differ. The huge melting
point difference and the resulting faster diffusion of tin atoms lead
to the formation of a tin-rich oxide shell. This synthetic method
could be transferred to other tin-based bimetallic nanoparticles containing,
for example, cobalt or iron.

Methods
Oleylamine (technical grade,
70%), tin chloride (SnCl2, 98%), nickel chloride (NiCl2, 98%), tributylphosphine
(93.5%), lithium-bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiN(SiMe3)2, 97%), toluene (99.8%), diisobutylaluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran
(1 M DIBAH in tetrahydrofuran), and oleic acid (technical grade, 90%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

The synthesis of Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles was
performed on the basis of the synthesis of tin nanoparticles established
by Kravchyk et al.21 In the first step,
130 mL of (0.4 mol) oleylamine was dried at 140 °C under argon/vacuum
using a Schlenk line. Then, 95 mg of (0.5 mmol) tin chloride crystals
was added to the solution and again dried for 30 min. Thereafter,
the solution was heated up to 235 °C under argon atmosphere.
A freshly prepared solution of 1054 mg of (6.3 mmol) lithium-bis(trimethylsilyl)amide
in 3 mL of toluene was injected. The color of the solution turned
from slightly yellow to orange immediately, accompanied by gas evolution.
Directly thereafter, a freshly prepared solution of 49 mg of (0.375
mmol) nickel chloride in 5 mL of tributylphosphine was injected as
well, followed by an injection of 2 mL (2 mmol) of the reducing agent
DIBAH, turning the solution brown. The temperature had dropped during
the injections to around 230 °C at which it stayed for 21 h.
Afterward, the solution was cooled down slowly by removing the heating
mantle, centrifuged with methanol, and the black precipitate was redispersed
in an oleic acid/toluene solution, washed with methanol, and redispersed
in toluene. In the last step, the nanoparticle dispersion was centrifuged
and the obtained supernatant containing the colloidal dispersed Ni3Sn4 nanoparticles was used for further investigations.

X-ray
Powder Diffraction
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
data were recorded using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation and a Bragg Brentano θ–θ
setup. The samples were prepared by dropping the nanoparticle dispersion
onto low-background silicon sample holders. The diffraction patterns
were analyzed by Rietveld refinement with Maud software version 2.80.47

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed using a Zeiss EM 900N
microscope with an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. High-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images were collected on JEOL 2100F with an electron acceleration
voltage of 200 kV. Carbon-coated copper grids were used as sample
holders covered with diluted nanoparticle solution. For energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Oxford INCA Energy TEM250 with SDD detector
X-Max80 was used.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS measurements were
performed on an ESCALAB 250 Xi system (Thermo Fisher, East Grinstead,
U.K.) with monochromatized Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV), with a spot diameter of 650 μm. Charge
compensation was applied if necessary. For sample preparation, an
aliquot of the nanoparticle dispersion was dropped on an Au-coated
substrate and dried. Data analysis was conducted with Avantage software
version 5.977. All signals were charge-referenced to the C 1s signal
(EB = 284.8 eV). The sputtering procedure
was undertaken carefully with large argon clusters with a kinetic
energy of 4 keV while the sample was rotated. Between every etching
step and the subsequent measurement, a delay time was introduced.
