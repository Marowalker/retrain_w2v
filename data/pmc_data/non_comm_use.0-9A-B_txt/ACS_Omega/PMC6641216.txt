In this work, a strategic synthesis
of Co3O4 nano-octahedra was developed through
the facile nanoscale coordination
polymer (NCP) route, which was further modified by SiO2 to be used as a sensor for enhanced sensing of hydrogen. The Co(II)-NCP-derived
Co3O4 octahedra and SiO2-modified
Co3O4 octahedra were characterized using Fourier
transform infrared, powder X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
thermogravimetric analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2TPR) techniques. The SiO2-modified Co3O4 sensor exhibited a stronger and selective electrical
response to H2 gas over NOx at 225 °C than Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 octahedra and the conventional Co3O4 powder.
The composite sensor shows faster recovery and significant repeatability
than the other two. The enhancement in the sensing performance of
the SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedron
was explained by the effectiveness of surface modification, controlled
morphology, and combination of synergistic effect of Co3O4 and SiO2. Surface engineering of the as-prepared
Co3O4 nano-octahedra with an exposed (111) surface
plane and later SiO2 modification facilitates effective
gas adsorption, resulting in enhancement in sensing and selectivity
over NOx. The details of the synergistic
effect and the plausible reasons for the improvement in gas-sensing
parameters are discussed here. This study would offer new directions
for development on the controlled synthesis of porous materials, in
general, and in gas sorption or sensing, in particular.

==== Body
Introduction
Low ignition energy
and wide flammable range make hydrogen gas
an easily inflammable explosive. As it cannot be detected by human
sensory organs, a rapid and accurate hydrogen detector is required
during the production, storage, and utilization of hydrogen. Traditionally,
hydrogen is detected by gas chromatographs, mass spectrometers, and
specific ionization gas pressure sensors, which are limited by their
large size, expensive cost, lab space, and slow response.1,2 Thus, it is essential to get a simple device/sensor for safety hazard
monitoring with a smaller size, lower cost of production, and power
consumption as well as lower operational temperature, faster response,
and recovery. There are many types of hydrogen sensors available,
including electrochemical, semiconductor, thermoelectric, metallic,
optical ones, and so forth.3,4 Among them, in recent
years, semiconducting metal oxide sensors have been the most widely
considered groups of chemiresistive gas sensors, which exhibit high
sensitivity, rapid response, long-term stability, and potential for
integration in hydrogen-sensing performance.5−7 In general,
the p-type metal oxide semiconductor possesses lower sensitivity than
the n-type semiconductor; as a result, development of or achieving
a higher sensing p-type semiconductor is still a challenge. Among
the p-type semiconductors, Co3O4 was found to
be the most stable and promising material to sense different types
of gases under experimental conditions.8 The p-type behavior in Co3O4 originates from
an overstoichiometric content of oxygen (caused by metal vacancies
in the crystal lattice and/or excess oxygen at interstitial sites).
Thus, intrinsic acceptor states exist, which, by trapping electrons,
create electron holes that act as charge carriers. Under an air atmosphere,
additional oxygen species may chemically adsorb at the semiconductor’s
surface (localized extrinsic acceptor states), thereby further increasing
the charge carrier (hole) concentration within the surface-near region,
that is, forming a hole accumulation layer. Oxidizing gases such as
O2 or NO2 enhance this effect. On the other
hand, exposure to reducing gases, such as CO, H2, or CH4, leads to a decrease of the surface-trapped negative charges,
which results in a decrease in the electrical conductivity.9 Hence, sensing of such gases in low concentrations
is possible by measuring the conductivity of the semiconductor (resistive
gas sensor). In the literature, numerous studies are found on the
nanostructured Co3O4 materials as a gas sensor
for CO,10 H2,11 ethanol, and NOx.12 The electric response to different gases lies
in the change of resistance, caused by changes in the free-electron
density as a consequence of physisorption, chemisorption, and catalytic
reactions of the analyte gas on the surface of Co3O4.

However, the sensitivity and selectivity of Co3O4 over desired gases are very poor, which limits
its practical
use in the field of gas sensing. As it is a surface-related phenomenon,
researchers have paid attention to fabricate Co3O4 with different dopants, adhesives, binders, volatile fillers, and
electrodes to enhance the effective surface area and sensing characteristics
of Co3O4 gas sensors.13 In addition to variations in the composition of other semiconductors
with Co3O4, the controlled morphology of Co3O4 having a unique shape and size offers another
path for sensor design, as sensitivity of Co3O4 was considerably influenced by the variation of the surface lattice
plane caused by different particle shapes and/or by changing the surface
area caused by different particle sizes. Hence, the design of this
morphology-controlled synthesis of Co3O4 was
paid great attention by the researchers.14,15 Most of the outcomes of nanostructured Co3O4 came from cobalt precursors such as cobalt acetate, cobalt nitrate,
cobalt sulfate, and so forth, and they have been widely exploited
in the field of super capacitors and Li-ion batteries.16,17 But nowadays, NCP/metal oxide framework (MOF) precursor-derived
semiconducting metal oxide are in high demand because of the control
of size and shape of materials on the nanoscale, and the strategy
of synthesis of metal oxide by this pathway has been proven very promising
in the field of photocatalysis and Li-ion batteries because during
the calcinations of NCPs/MOFs, effective solid-state diffusion improved
the interfacial contact, forming a significant porous nanostructure.18,19 However, there are several limitations while using various unique
structures of MOFs/NCPs. In major probabilities, different MOFs always
result in analogous superstructures. Besides that, metal or metal
oxides tend to aggregate and lose their hierarchical superstructures
in the pyrolysis process.20 Therefore,
development of new green strategies to fabricate metal or metal oxide
hierarchical superstructures based on MOFs/NCPs still needs to be
explored.21

Instead of conventional
thermal pyrolysis of MOFs/NCPs, here, in
the present work, we made an alternate to modify the approach to the
NCP/MOF-derived synthesis of Co3O4. We found
that nanostructured Co3O4 with a unique octahedral
shape morphology and exposed (111) facets can be synthesized from
the Co(II)-NCP precursor with controlled removal of organic moieties
by our strategic wet chemical approach (base hydrolysis); and to the
best of our knowledge, strategically synthesized Co3O4 octahedra [with exposed (111) facets] from the NCP route
have been employed for the first time toward sensing of H2 gas. Furthermore, the as-prepared Co3O4 octahedron
is surface-modified by SiO2 to get improved sensing properties
compared to the unmodified Co3O4 octahedron
(NCP-derived) and conventional Co3O4 powder,
which could be used as an ideal sensor for H2 gas in the
background of NOx- and
CO-contaminated environment.

Results and Discussion
Analytical Instruments
The phase formation behavior
and structural characteristics of the synthesized materials were characterized
by the following instrumental techniques. Fourier transform infrared
spectra (FT-IR) were measured with a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrophotometer
RXI, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was done using a
Bruker APEX-2 diffractometer. The surface morphologies were characterized
using scanning electron microscopy (NOVA NanoSEM 450) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2010) operating at 200 kV. Energy dispersive
X-ray (EDX) measurement was performed using an FEI Tecnai-G2-20S-Twin
Instrument (USA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on
a PerkinElmer instrument, PYRIS Diamond TG/DTA with an Al2O3 crucible. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)-N2 sorption isotherms (77 K) were performed by using a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out
by SPECS (Germany). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed using a Quantachrome ChemBET-3000 TPR
apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector. The reducing gas was
10 vol % H2/Ar with a total flow rate of 80 mL min–1, and the temperature range was from room temperature
to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K min–1.

Structural Characterization
FT-IR Analysis
Initially, the formation
of cobalt nanocoordination
polymers was verified by FT-IR spectra (Figure 1a), in which the CO-stretching frequency
at 1686 cm–1 of the pure H2BDC ligand
shifted to 1579 cm–1, indicating the coordination
of carboxylate groups of H2BDC to Co2+ ions.26 It also exhibits absorption bands around 3400
and 1625 cm–1, which are due to the −OH stretching
and bending vibrations for free or physically absorbed water molecules.27,28

(iv) Co(II)-NCP measured at 77 K, and (d) Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore distribution curves based on the adsorption isotherm.

After successful removal of the
organic moiety by base hydrolysis
and followed by hydrothermal treatment of Co(II)-NCP, all these strong
and weak peaks vanished, and two new characteristic bands appeared
at 663 and 567 cm–1 for Co3O4 octahedra attributed to the Co(II)–O stretching from Co(II)
ions present in the tetrahedral coordination arrangement and Co(III)–O
stretching from Co(III) in the octahedral coordination, respectively.29,30 After modification of Co3O4 by SiO2, the material still exhibits infrared bands at 662 and 565 cm–1, which confirm the presence of Co3O4 in SiO2 without any significant change. Absorption
around 1050, 960, and 806 cm–1 are characteristic
bands of asymmetric, symmetric, stretching modes of Si–O–Si.

X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
Figure 1b shows the XRD patterns of Co(II)-NCP, Co3O4 octahedra, and SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedra. The diffraction peaks at a lower
angle represent the formation of crystalline cobalt(II)-NCP, and the
highest diffraction peak shifted to a higher angle indicates the formation
of the new phase of cobalt, which could be indexed to the spinel-type
FCC crystalline lattice of Co3O4 (JCPDS card
# 78-1970). However, it was found that the fabrication of SiO2 does not change or alter any diffraction pattern, which recommends
the formation of two-phase composites, though the diffraction peaks
of Co3O4 in the composites had relatively low
intensity compared to pure Co3O4. It could be
ascribed to the shielding effect of the porous silica layer in front
of the X-rays.31 The absence of diffraction
peaks corresponding to the silica matrix indicates that the silica
in the composites is amorphous in nature. Diffraction peaks (Figure S1) were fitted using Lorentzian line
shapes for accurate determination of the apparent crystallite size
of Co3O4. 1  

According to Scherrer
formula (eq 1), the apparent
crystallite size of Co3O4 in the regular Co3O4 powder and Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 octahedra was calculated. Here, k is
the constant equal to 0.9, λ is the wavelength of the radiation,
β is the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) intensity in radians,
and θ is the Bragg angle.32 The apparent
crystallite size for Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 in a pure octahedral shape is found to be about 14.5 nm, where the
average crystallite size of Co3O4 powder is
found to be 51, which is quite larger than that of Co(II)-NCP-derived
Co3O4 octahedra. Significant decrease of the
crystallite size has been observed in the case of strategically synthesized
Co3O4. The intensity of the diffraction pattern
corresponding to the (111) plane increased in comparison to the diffraction
pattern of the (220) plane for Co3O4 synthesized
from Co(II)-NCP, as shown in Figure S1a. It indicates preferential orientation of the crystal, especially
dominated by the exposed (111) facets.

TGA
TGA of Co(II)-NCP
and the Co3O4 derived from Co(II)-NCP are given
in Figure S2, which suggests that the organic moieties in the former
got decomposed at 400 °C, whereas there is no change in the weight
of the latter. It indicates the complete removal of organic moieties
that occurred during the synthesis by base hydrolysis.

BET Analysis
To investigate the surface area of all
prepared materials, nitrogen sorption isotherms were performed, as
shown in Figure 1c.
We observed that Co3O4 powder displayed type
(II) isotherm, whereas both Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 and SiO2-modified Co3O4 exhibited
type (IV) isotherms according to the IUPAC classification. Also, these
materials have a BET surface area of 103.6, 138.4, and 150.1 m2/g. Notably, Co3O4 powder shows a pore
size distribution around 3 nm (Figure 1d), and the NCP-derived Co3O4 shows a bimodal pore size distribution of around 2 and 4.8 nm, which
may exclude the sensing behavior with respect to the response time.
Remarkable increase of the BET surface area, changes in the total
pore volume, and average pore size of the materials were achieved
after modification of the synthetic strategy, as shown in Table 1. BET surface area,
total pore volume, and average pore size have great influence on the
gas sensing performance of the material; especially the adsorption
capacity attributes significant enhancement in sensitivity for gases.

The
adsorption capacity of the prepared materials was also tested
in the presence of aqueous solution of RhB (185 ppm). It was found
that the SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedra
possesses a better adsorption capacity (120 mg/g) in comparison to
Co3O4 octahedra (60 mg/g), which is again far
better than the conventional powder Co3O4 (48
mg/g) (Figure S3). It signifies that the
adsorption at the solid–liquid interface follows the same trend
with the BET surface area.

The adsorption of RhB onto SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedra at 283, 298,
and 333 K was provided (Figure S4) to understand
the effect of temperature
on adsorption. There is a significant decrease in the adsorption capacity
from 283 to 333 K, which confirms the exothermic nature of the isotherms.

FESEM, TEM, and HRTEM Analysis
FESEM image of Co3O4 powder, as shown in Figure 2a and in the inset of Figure 2a, exhibits an aggregated dense microstructure
consisting of a rough surface and fine particles of indefinite shape
and size (40–120 nm), which recommends that conventional method
deals with a nonuniform architecture and deprived surface activity.
It is notable that an uniform octahedral shaped Co3O4 was obtained when we found a new strategy to control the
shape of Co3O4 from Co(II)-NCP as a cobalt precursor
(shown in Figure 2b
and inset). The obtained octahedral shaped Co3O4 exhibits side edges of diameter ranging from 20 to 50 nm. The uniform
octahedral architecture reveals that Co(II)-NCP acts as a self-template
(capping agent) during the formation of Co3O4. During the hydrolysis, the organic ligand containing the active
COO– group adsorbed selectively on the (100) and
(011) surface planes, which may hinder the atomic addition on the
respective plane. Consequently, the preferential growth on the (111)
plane renders the formation of crystalline Co3O4 nano-octahedra with the lowest surface energy. Each octahedron is
enclosed by eight (111) facets. The details of the exposed (111) facets
of the Co3O4 nano-octahedron are explained in
the next section using HRTEM analysis. Then, Co3O4 octahedrons are treated with different amounts of tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) to modify the surface, as shown in Figure 2c (COSI 71) and Figure 2d (COSI 73); it was observed that both COSI
71 and COSI 73 retained the octahedron morphology with SiO2. However, in the case of COSI 73, SiO2 tends to form
an aggregated matrix, whereas Co3O4 was embedded.
Also, FESEM results support the crystallite size of powder Co3O4 and Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 octahedra calculated from the Debye Scherer equation. Unavoidably,
trace amounts of Co3O4 nano-octahedron bigger
than 20 nm were observed, which could be due to surface relaxation
in the material in comparison to bulk materials. To provide further
insight into the hetero-nanostructures of the SiO2-modified
Co3O4 (COSI 71), further TEM (Figure 2e inset) and elemental mapping
(Figure 2f) of COSI
71 were also performed. TEM images show that SiO2 is more
or less uniformly present in the surface of Co3O4 octahedron with sizes of 15–40 nm.

porous Co3O4 nano-octahedra [COSI 71, inset
showing the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)

images of the synthesized COSI 71.

Elemental mapping of selected area in FESEM (Figure 2e) also shows the preferential
density of
the Si element on the surface of Co3O4. SiO2 being a good surface coating agent prevents agglomeration
of Co3O4 and developed a well-oriented path
for charge carrier during gas sensing. Unavoidably, few SiO2 aggregated during TEM analysis, forming an interconnected domain
of Co3O4 octahedron.

EDX analysis of SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedron shown in Figure S5 demonstrates
that the atomic % of Co, O, and Si are 23.4, 70.6, and 6.0, respectively
(Table S3). Thus, the amount of SiO2 is very less in the bulk of the material; however, the surface
composition can be quantified from XPS, which is discussed in the
XPS characterization section.

In addition, the HRTEM image of
the composites shows amorphous
SiO2 attached over the edges of the crystalline Co3O4 octahedron, keeping the (111) plane exposed
(Figure 3b–d).
The SAED pattern in Figure 3a was indexed, which also supports the presence of well-crystalline
Co3O4 showing a ring pattern, and the absence
of ring pattern for SiO2 indicates the amorphous nature
of SiO2. To reveal the exposed surfaces, we refer to the
HRTEM image of different single Co3O4 octahedra
in the composites taken along the [011] direction (Figure 3b–d); the two-dimensional
projection appears to be full- or half-diamond like. Lattice fringes,
as shown in Figure 3b–d, assigned a d value of 0.46 nm, which
corresponds to the lattice plane (111) of Co3O4. These results are consistent with the octahedral morphology of
the Co3O4 nanocrystal with eight exposed {111}
surfaces (see the model structure presented in Figure 4a). As the crystal growth is a very dynamic
process, it involves simultaneous growth of different planes and ultimate
shapes of particles resulting from the competition of the growing
planes.33 Co3O4 has
the normal spinel structure, in which the Co(II) ion in the formula
unit occupies the tetrahedral site, whereas the two Co(III) ions occupy
the octahedral sites. Figure 4b–d depicts the closely packed planes of {001}, {111},
and {110} and their surface atomic configurations of the spinel-type
Co3O4 crystals. Experimental and theoretical
measurements have shown that the three low Miller index planes ({100},
{110}, and {111}) of these particles with an FCC structure differ
in the surface atomic density as well as in the electronic structure,
geometric bonding, and chemical reactivity.34 As a result, those planes follow the order of surface energies;
γ {111} < γ {100} < γ {110}.

XPS Analysis
Figure 5 shows the XPS survey
spectrum of the Co(II)-NCP-derived
and SiO2-modified Co3O4. The positions
of Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks are in accordance
with the literature values in the range of 779.0–780.8 and
794.3–796.1 eV, respectively,35 with
the Si 2p peak at 102.18 V, as shown in Figure 5a,b. The Si 2p peak slightly shifted from
the standard value of SiO2 (i.e., 103.5 eV), indicating
the interaction of SiO2 with Co3O4.36 A comparison of Co 2p regions and
O 1s regions of Co3O4 in powder Co3O4, Co3O4 octahedra, and SiO2-modified Co3O4 materials is shown in Figure 5c,d, respectively.
It revealed that the obtained binding energy values in the range of
779.0–780.8 and 794.3–796.1 eV of Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks corresponded to Co2+ and Co3+ states. This result confirms the existence of high-spin
Co2+ in tetrahedral coordination and Co3+ in
octahedral coordination in the sample. Moreover, the comparative study
of the fitted Co 2p peaks (specially Co 2p3/2) in the sample
clearly tells that the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ significantly
changes from 2.86 to 2.01 for powder Co3O4 and
Co3O4 octahedra, respectively. However, the
ratio of Co3+/Co2+ in the SiO2-modified
Co3O4 octahedra increases slightly to 2.12 from
2.01, as shown in Table 2. The results strongly supported the presence of excess Co(II) species
on the surface of the octahedral shaped Co3O4 compared to that of powder Co3O4. The O 1s
peak of powder Co3O4 at 529.4 eV exhibits a
shoulder located at 531.6 eV, which is assigned as the OH species
on the surface of Co3O4. The location of the
binding energies for these peaks agreed well with the reported value.37,38 From the comparative study, we found that the intensity of the shoulder
peak of O 1s for Co3O4 octahedra decreased and
slightly shifted to 531.2 eV. The result may be attributed to more
−OH groups present on the surface. The SiO2-modified
Co3O4 octahedra exhibit two sharp peaks located
at 529.5 eV and 532.3. Thus, the O 1s peak was further deconvoluted
into five peaks for the lattice oxygen, surface −OH group,
and Co–O–Si region, as shown in Table 2. The results show that the surface-OH of
the SiO2-modified Co3O4 is mainly
contributed by SiO2. The peak located at 533.2 is assigned
as the binding energy corresponding to the Si–O–Co species,
which is in good agreement with the literature report.38 The atomic percentages of Co, Si, and O (Table S3) are calculated to be 16.2, 21.4, and
62.3, respectively, from the XPS, where the content of Si is found
to be larger compared to Co, and the atomic ratio of Si/Co is found
to be 1.3, which is larger than the Si/Co ratio (0.25) obtained from
EDX analysis. This result shows that SiO2 is more preferable
to be retained on the surface of the material.

H2-TPR Analysis
Considering
that the reducibility
of a metal oxide catalyst is an important factor influencing its related
catalytic performance in redox reactions such as gas sensing,58 herein, H2-TPR experiments were performed
to investigate the reducibility of the Co3O4 powder, Co3O4 octahedron, and SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedron. Figure 6 shows the H2-TPR
profile for the samples. Notably, there were mainly two reduction
regions over the Co3O4 catalysts. The one in
the low-temperature range of 200–350 °C was attributed
to the reduction of Co3+ into Co2+, and the
one in the high-temperature range of 350–600 °C was associated
with the further reduction of Co2+ to metallic cobalt.59 i   ii

to a high temperature of 700 °C. Luo et al.60 and Spadaro et al.61 found that
the reduction behavior of Co3O4 is highly dependent
on the dispersion state of cobalt. Large particles of Co3O4 were usually reduced to metallic cobalt in a single
step, whereas nanoparticles often went through a two-step process.
Thus, the broad range of reduction may be reflected due to the larger
crystallite size of the powder Co3O4. The relative
percentage of reduction calculated in the low-temperature region was
31.72% of the total consumption of H2 (%), whereas Co3O4 octahedron reduced to CoO in the first step
with a very low relative percentage of low-temperature hydrogen consumption
of 18.6% of the total consumption. The result implied that distribution
of different proportions of Co2+ and Co3+ are
present in the prepared Co3O4 octahedron, where
Co3+ proportion is less in comparison to the Co3O4 powder. It is corroborated with the surface molar ratio
of Co2+/Co3+ on the material obtained from the
XPS analysis. SiO2-modified Co3O4 shows the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO in the
range of 230–370 °C, and a broad reduction profile in
the higher temperature region was also observed. H2-TPR
peaks corresponding to step (1) will significantly shift toward the
high-temperature region, indicating that the interaction between the
cobalt oxide species and silica becomes stronger and cobalt species
is more difficult to be reduced. The reduction peak temperature higher
than 550 °C can be attributed to the reduction of Co–Si
solid-state composite oxide that is more difficult for CoO to be reduced
to active Co species because of the strong interaction of CoO and
Si–OH groups.

Gas-Sensing Properties
The gas-sensing
property of
Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 octahedron and SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedron (COSI 71)
was investigated with H2 and NOx as model gases. For comparison, a gas sensor based on Co3O4 powder was also fabricated and tested with H2 gas. The sensing properties are highly dependent on the operating
temperature because the adsorption–desorption property of the
gas on sensing materials highly depended on temperature.39,40 Therefore, we first investigated the influence of the operating
temperature on the sensing response (in %) of the sensor. To determine
the optimum operating temperature, the responses in terms of resistance
change of Co3O4 powder, Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4, and Co(II)-NCP-derived SiO2-modified
Co3O4 gas sensors toward 100 ppm of H2 were tested as a function of the operating temperature between 175
and 325 °C, as shown in Figure 7a–c. It was found that the sensing response
varies with the operating temperature, and the maximum response appears
for all materials around 200–225 °C, as shown in Figure 7d. Contradictory
to the n-type semiconductors, the resistance of our prepared sensors
increases upon exposure to reducing gases, which presume a p-type
semiconductor feature.41,42

Co3O4, and (iii) Co(II)-NCP-derived SiO2-modified Co3O4 sensor (COSI 71) to
varying working temperatures at concentrations of 100 ppm H2.

This is well-collaborated with
the finding that Co3O4 is a typical p-type semiconductor.43 The response % of Co3O4 powder over H2 gas does not change tremendously upon
variation of temperature
while exposed to a reducing gas. Meanwhile, NCP-derived Co3O4 shows relatively higher response for H2,
and its sensitivity improved dramatically when it was modified with
SiO2. The response value is the highest for Co(II)-NCP-derived
SiO2-modified Co3O4 (COSI 71), followed
by Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 and then the Co3O4 powder. The result reveals that strategically
synthesized Co3O4 octahedra and SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedra have the best sensing
performance. The response of SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedra sensor to 100 ppm of H2 is 62.7%.
The response value obtained is 20 times higher than that for the conventional
Co3O4 powder. Moreover, it is highly significant
than the response obtained with the Co3O4 octahedra
(30%) and conventional Co3O4 powder (3.2%) and
comparable with other Co3O4 nanostructures already
reported in the literature (Tables S2 and 3). Hence, it is overwhelming to learn that the uniform
morphology and the integration of Co3O4 with
SiO2 coating effectively improve the gas sensing performance
of the Co3O4 material.

For a better understanding of the response behavior,
the role of
SiO2 has been investigated. Thus, the Co3O4 octahedron is modified with SiO2 by varying the
precursor ratio of Co(II)/TEOS (14:1, 7:1, 7:2, and 7:3), and two
other samples such as Co3O4 octahedron and pure
SiO2 were taken as references. It is interesting to observe
from Figure 8 that
sample COSI 71 prepared from TEOS/Co(II) = 7:1 exhibited a higher
gas sensing performance with a response value of 62.7% at 100 ppm
than other samples such as COSI 72, COSI 73, and COSI 141.

Figure 8 Response and
recovery characteristic curves of pure SiO2 and SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedra
sensor (COSI 141, COSI 71, COSI 72, and COSI 73) synthesized from
the varied precursor ratio of Co/TEOS (14:1, 7:1, 7:2, and 7:3, respectively)
to 100 ppm H2 at 225 °C.

The response % of sample COSI 71 was compared with all samples,
and it was found that COSI 72, COSI 73, COSI 141, and pure SiO2 exhibit 49, 36, 29, and 8% response, respectively. Pure SiO2 possesses negligible response because of its insulating property.
It can be observed that in samples COSI 72 and COSI 73, the recovery
time for 100 ppm H2 decreased by an increase in the SiO2 content, whereas with a decrease in the SiO2 content,
the recovery time had increased. Sample COSI 141 had the smaller response
among the composites because of the least amount of SiO2, which was not able to provide extra adsorption sites, resulting
in a very close sensitivity to the pristine Co3O4 octahedron (30%). When the amount of SiO2 was too much,
the surface of the composite was fully composed of SiO2 (Figure 2d) and less
amount of Co3O4, resulting in a less contact
area with the H2 gas.56,57 Therefore,
it can be concluded that the ratio of Co3O4 and
SiO2 played an important role in the gas-sensing performance
of the composites, and the synergistic effect is a crucial factor
under a definite composition of Co3O4 and SiO2. Thus, the SiO2-modified Co3O4 (COSI 71) was optimized to obtain a better sensing behavior. Detailed
studies were carried out further using this optimized sensor (COSI
71). The sensing responses of the sensor (COSI 71) as a function of
the H2 concentration (10–100 ppm) are shown in Figure 9a. It can be seen
that the responses of the sensor follow an almost linear increase
with increasing H2 concentration (shown in Figure 9b). Furthermore, the sensor
resistance recovers almost to the initial value when the test chamber
was refreshed with air, and complete recovery (90%) of the baseline
conductance values for the tested gases at the end of each pulse indicates
a reversible interaction between the sensing materials and target
analyte (Figure 9c).
This is a key issue in view of the eventual development for technology
applications. Figure 10a–d shows the response % transients of (i) Co3O4 powder, (ii) Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4, and (iii) Co(II)-NCP-derived SiO2-modified Co3O4 (COSI 71) sensors at different temperatures. By careful
notice at the transients for various sensor materials of H2 sensing, we found that COSI 71 sensor has excellent baseline recovery
at 225 °C, and fascinatingly, at different temperatures, the
recovery rate of the sensor remains unaltered. Figure 10e,f shows the response and recovery times
of all sensors measured at 225 °C. It is noteworthy to say that
Co(II)-NCP-derived SiO2-modified Co3O4 (COSI 71) exhibits faster recovery time (τrec)
(see Figure 10f(i))
compared to the Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 octahedron.
Although recovery (τrec) is faster, the response
time (τres) of the sensor is longer compared to the
Co3O4 powder and Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 octahedron (see Figure 10e(i)).

The response characteristic curves of the composites at 10
ppm
NOx were also tested at different temperatures
for understanding the sensitivity over oxidizing gases, as shown in Figure 11a. It has been
observed on comparison to H2, the sensitivity is too low
to be considered within this temperature range, though the sensor
at an operating temperature of 250 °C achieves negligible response
% of magnitude 0.5 (Figure 11c,d). Figure 11b shows the selectivity of the sensor (kH2_NOx), which increases with
decreasing temperature.

Gas-Sensing Mechanism/Discussion
The reactions involved
in the gas sensing phenomena are iii   iv  

A steady state between these two reactions
determines the concentration of O– on the surface
of the semiconductor and the conductance of the p-type semiconductor.
In our case, the main sensing material is Co3O4. Initially, the surface of Co3O4 in air is
saturated with negatively charged oxygen species. When the testing
system is exposed to analytes (such as H2), the oxygen
species on Co3O4 promotes the oxidation of test
gas molecules to H2O and the release of electrons, which
induces a change in conductance. Powder Co3O4 shows negligible sensitivity in that particular temperature; this
result may be attributed to the lower surface area and bigger particle
size, which provide a flatter surface to the gases, and as a result,
the gas molecules become more reluctant to get adsorbed on the surface.
Further, Co(II)-NCP-derived Co3O4 shows excellent
H2-sensing performance as it exhibits a well-defined octahedral
shape with an edge length of 20 nm and possesses a higher surface
area and larger pore diameter, as calculated from the BET measurement.
From the HRTEM images, XPS, and H2-TPR analysis, it is learnt that
the exposed (111) surface plane of the Co3O4 nano-octahedron consists of unsaturated Co(II), and it is well-understood
that the unsaturated bond in Co(II) possesses very high oxygen reduction
reaction activity.44 hence, compared to
Co3O4 powder, Co3O4 nano-octahedron
with exposed (111) facilitates more number of O2 to be
reduced during the test. Further, our material has no significant
response to CO, and there is no influence on the selectivity of H2. This could be due the reductive nature of CO, which is preferentially
interactive with the Co(III) sites.44 However,
our materials exhibit a predominant Co(II) feature on the surface.

The excellent interaction of unsaturated Co(II) with oxygen increases
the rate of reduction of O2, as shown in eq (iii), and maximizes the O– (reactive oxygen
species) concentration on the surface; as a result, sensitivity of
the Co3O4 octahedra is increased toward H2 gas. Apart from the chemisorption mechanism, the effect of
size can be another factor, as recently suggested by Barsan et al.
that gas response can be measured semiquantitatively from the cube
model; and accordingly they found an increase in the size of the cube;
the entire resistance depends less upon the variation in the resistance
of the shell layer because the conduction along the resistive core
region, whose cross-sectional area is very wide, will dominate.45,46 Thus, the gas response will accordingly remain low unless the chemiresistive
variation at the shell region is very high. In our case, we found
that the smaller size of the Co3O4 octahedron
and chemiresistive phenomena of the Co3O4 with
larger surface area works parallel. Further, it was understood that
when Co3O4 is modified by SiO2, the
sensitivity is remarkably increased under an optimized Co3O4 and SiO2 ratio. The mesoporous nature of
Co3O4 and SiO2 increases the active
site for higher H2 and O2 gas adsorption during
sensing. As a result, more number of O2 got reduced to
O2–/O–, and more number of H2 molecules got oxidized to H2O by ejecting electron
to the conduction band of Co3O4, leading to
lowering of the conductivity of the composite. The integration of
SiO2 on Co3O4 not only provides extra
adsorption sites (surface area 150.1 m2/g) but also generates
a native oxide layer, which could be regarded as a passivation layer
on the Co3O4 surface. As a consequence, these
factors can greatly reduce the density of interface states caused
by the surface defect and lattice mismatch, resulting in great enhancement
of gas response.47,48

In addition, FESEM image (shown in Figure S6) of the used sample
revealed that the surrounding of SiO2 on Co3O4 may prevent lattice ions of Co3+, Co2+, and O2– from self-diffusion and suppress
the crystallite growth; as a result, the crystallite of Co3O4 maintains continuity and stability during the sensing
experiments, which induces better recyclability and is fruitful from
the economic point of view. The response time of Co(II)-NCP-derived
Co3O4 octahedra toward H2 is very
fast, whereas the recovery time is very slow in comparison to SiO2-modified Co3O4 sensors. The faster
recovery time of the SiO2-modified Co3O4 sensor than the Co3O4 octahedra could
be due to the existence of the bimodal pore size distribution of the
material, as shown in the BET N2 adsorption isotherm (Figure 1d). When Co3O4 is modified with SiO2, the asymmetry in
the particle size with two different crystal structures generates
bimodal pores, and because of this bimodal pore size distribution
of the composites, the reaction products can easily come out of the
sensor.55 As a consequence, the SiO2-modified Co3O4 sensor exhibits faster
recovery time by desorbing target gases more easily. From the aspect
of atomic point of view, the reason for the delayed recovery time
for the Co3O4 octahedron sensor can be well-explained
and is shown in Scheme 1. We found desorption of water after oxidation of H2 playing
a key role in the recovery time, as adsorption of water on the surface
of sensor inhibits the active sites. In the recent study, it was found
that the defect sites of the oxide material are likely to play a decisive
role in the dissociation of water;49 so,
with the presence of excessive defects of the oxide materials, the
interaction of water on the surface is strongly enhanced. In our case,
we found specifically that Co(II) enrichment in the Co3O4 nano-octahedron with exposed (111) surface is responsible
for stronger adsorption of water, which in turn possess slow desorption.
The surface modification by SiO2 negates the influence
of Co(II) on the surface, and hence, abrupt desorption of water molecules
from the surface occurs along rapidness in the recovery time.

Co(II)-NCP-Derived Co3O4 Octahedra and SiO2-Modified Co3O4 Octahedra Over H2
Considering the selectivity
of the Co(II)-NCP-derived SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedra over NOx and H2, it was found that the sensor
is only selective toward H2 in that temperature range.
Though the understanding of selectivity is not very clear, one can
emphasize the selectivity of materials on the following parameters:
(1) the types of gases that have to be oxidized and (2) adsorption
sites of the materials. Here, the integration of SiO2 on
Co3O4 provides specific adsorption sites and
acts as a dense filter.50,51 Among the two gases
considered, hydrogen, which presents the smallest molecular diameter
(0.22 nm), can easily pass through the SiO2 surface layer.52,53 On the contrary, the biggest molecule like NOx (mainly mixture of NO, d = 0.3 nm and N2O, d = 0.375 nm) undergoes diffusion control
by the SiO2 layer.54 The hydrogen
sensitivity and selectivity are then significantly improved, compared
with the matrix of NOx, and also better
than that of other Co3O4 nanostructures reported
in the earlier literature (summarized in Table S2).

Conclusions
In summary, this study
provides a simple and viable strategy to
synthesize Co3O4 octahedra with (111) surface
through the Co(II)-NCP precursor. The Co3O4 octahedra
on the nanoscale acquires a unique morphology and small size and consequently
developed a larger surface area, which resulted in better sensing
performances for H2 gas with respect to the conventionally
obtained Co3O4 powder. Further, the surface
modification by SiO2 offered desired control on the surface
active sites for enhanced and selective sensing of H2 gas
over NOx or CO background, which could
be applicable to potential industrial environment. Because of the
structural diversity of NCPs, the demonstrated synthetic approach
could be extended for the preparation of many other metal oxides in
the future, for probable gas sensing, and for a variety of surface-aided
applications.

Experimental Details
Reagents and Materials
2,5-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate
was obtained from Loba Chemie Pvt Ltd (India). All other chemicals
including solvents used in this investigation were of analytical grade
(99.9%). All solutions were prepared using purified water (Milli-Q
system).

Preparation of 2,5-Dihydroxylated Salophen Ligands (2,5-DHS)
2,5-DHS was synthesized according to the literature procedure.22 Briefly, 2 mmol 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (0.276
g) was dissolved in ethanol (20 mL) and was slowly added to a solution
of o-phenylenediamine (1 mmol) in 20 mL of ethanol.
The final solution was refluxed at 60 °C for 3 h. The red color
solution was then evaporated to get a dry mass. The mass was dissolved
with a small amount of acetone, and then petroleum ether was added
to get the final product.

Preparation of NCPs, Corresponding Porous
Co3O4 Nano-Octahedron, and SiO2-Modified
Co3O4 Nano-Octahedron Materials
The
as-prepared
2,5-DHS ligand was dissolved in 1 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF), and
another solution of Co(OAc)2·4H2O in DMF
was added successively to it. The formation of Co(II)-NCP occurred
upon introduction of H2BDC into the reaction medium. The
product obtained was centrifuged, washed with acetonitrile, and then
dried at 60 °C for 3 h. We had followed a similar chemical synthesis
of Co(II) NCP (first step) as per a recent report from our lab.23 However, the previously executed method (pyrolysis
or decomposition) does not favor formation of unique morphology of
Co3O4. Hence, in the second step, we adopted
an alternate attempt for the synthesis Co3O4 octahedra from the Co(II)-NCP precursor using a wet chemical route.
The modified approach is expected to offer Co3O4 with specific features for gas sensing. The dried Co(II)-NCP was
dispersed in water and then treated with NaOH. The addition of the
base facilitated the displacement of organic moieties. The final solution
was transferred into an autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 160
°C under static conditions for 12 h to get Co3O4. The solid product thus obtained was separated by centrifugation
and washed thoroughly with purified water and absolute ethanol to
remove any impurities. The dried sample was dispersed in water/methanol
(1:1), and then TEOS [Co(II)/TEOS ratio 7:1 with respect to weight
of the precursor] was gradually added to the dispersion (abbreviated
as COSI 71). Meanwhile, 10 mL of ammonia solution (25%) was added
to the above solution and stirred for 3 h to obtain SiO2-modified Co3O4 octahedra, as shown in Scheme 2. The content of
SiO2 [Co(II)/TEOS = 7:2, 7:3, and 14:1] was also varied
for optimization in gas sensing, and they are abbreviated as COSI
72, COSI 73, and COSI 141, respectively. Also, simple Co3O4 powder was prepared by a conventional combustion route
at 500 °C directly from the Co(OAc)2 precursor.24

Gas-Sensing Experiments
The gas sensing properties
of the as-prepared materials were determined by measuring planar resistance
transients as a function of the gas concentration and temperature.
An indigenously designed dynamic flow gas-sensing setup, integrated
with a temperature controller, mass flow controller, and LabVIEW-based
data acquisition system, was utilized in this study, as shown in Scheme 3. The details of
fabrication of the sensor and the gas-sensing setup can be found from
the earlier literature of Mukherjee and Majumder.25 The response % of the prepared materials was calculated
by measuring the value of equilibrium resistance in air (Ra) and gas (Rg), as shown
below. 2  

Scheme 3 Schematic Representation of the Gas Sensing
Setup and Mechanism of
the Sensors
In certain cases,
equilibrium resistance was difficult to be achieved
(in the recorded resistance transients); in such cases, the resistance
corresponds to the notable change in the slope of the resistance transient
(dRg/dt), which has been
approximated as the equilibrium resistance in gas (Rg). For p-type sensors, the response and recovery times
are estimated as the time required to achieve 90% of the equilibrium
resistance in the gas environment (response time) and in air environment
(recovery time), respectively. The selectivity of the sensing materials
were estimated as 3  where selectivity (kgas1–gas2)
signifies the ratio of response % between
gas 1 (Sgas1) and gas 2 (Sgas2). In other words,
the selectivity is indicative of the relative response % of gas 1
with respect to gas 2.
