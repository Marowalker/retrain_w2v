An
anionic surfactant sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) aggregates
in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and their mixtures with water (up
to 50% w/w) in a contrasting manner. Two DESs, a mixture of choline
chloride + urea and choline chloride + ethylene glycol, commonly known
as Reline and Ethaline, respectively, are used as solvents. Behavior
of AOT at air–solution interface and aggregation in bulk is
investigated using surface tension, conductivity, fluorescence, and
dynamic light scattering measurements. The obtained results are correlated
with structural aspects of solvent systems as well as with inherent
properties of solvent such as Kamlet–Taft polarity parameters,
degree of cohesiveness derived from Gordon parameter (G), and cohesive energy density. It is observed that the spontaneity
of aggregation in neat DESs or DES–water mixtures follows a
trend reflected by various solvent parameters. However, characteristic
properties of aggregation in water does not fit into this trend, where
critical aggregation concentration of AOT is found in between 30 and
50% (w/w) of respective DES–water mixtures. 1H NMR
and 1H–1H 2D NOESY spectroscopy is employed
to get insights into reason behind this anomalous behavior. It is
observed that AOT forms self-assembled structures similar to that
of other surfactants in neat DESs, whereas it undergoes nanosegregation
in DESs–water mixtures. The present results are expected to
be useful for colloidal aspects of DESs and their mixtures with water.

Introduction
Deep eutectic solvents
(DESs) are mixtures of hydrogen bond donor
(HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) groups mixed in an appropriate
ratio and are liquid at room temperature.1 DESs are regarded as green solvents that can be utilized for diverse
applications2−10 owing to their properties such as low volatility, wide liquidus
range, wide electrochemical window, and bio-degradability, which places
them at par with ionic liquids (ILs). However, low-cost, nontoxicity,
and ease of preparation render DESs as better solvents or materials
than many of the ILs. DESs were found to act as solvents for self-assembly
of amphiphiles,11−16 despite having low cohesive energy density (ced) as compared to
water and other organic solvents. Their utility as a medium for self-assembly
of amphiphiles can further be enhanced by employing mixtures of DESs
with water, as physicochemical properties of DESs–water mixtures
are unique and not present in either of the pure components.17,18 In this regard, variety of amphiphiles such as phospholipids, anionic,
and cationic surfactants were shown to self-assemble in DESs or their
mixtures with water.2,11−15 The solvophobic interactions between hydrophobic
alkyl chains of surfactants and DESs along with H-bonding network
of DESs seem to play an important role in self-assembly of amphiphiles.

It has been established that the water content in DESs plays an
important role in modifying the structural properties of DESs depending
on the nature of components comprising DESs.19−21 Water when
present even in small amounts (≈6.5 wt %) has been found to
alter the solvent structure of DES (Reline) comprising 1:2 choline
chloride (ChCl) and urea (U).19 The interactions
between components of DES were found to weaken nonlinearly with the
increase in water content up to 40 wt %; however, the nanostructure
of DES was substantially observed. Higher water content, that is,
51 wt % disrupts the nanostructure of DES, and the solvent system
behaves like an aqueous solution of components of DES.19 A similar destructuring effect of water was
observed for other DESs based on 1:2 ChCl–ethylene glycol (EG,
Ethaline) as well as 1:2 ChCl–glycerol (Glyceline).20,21 Therefore, it seems important to investigate self-assembly behavior
of amphiphiles in DESs differing in inherent structures controllable
by choice of constituent components and addition of water.

Considering
the above discussed points, herein, aggregation behavior
of AOT in DESs prepared by mixing choline chloride and urea (Reline)
as well as choline chloride and EG (Ethaline) in molar ratio of 1:2
and their mixtures with water (10, 30, and 50%, w/w of water) is investigated.
The choice of AOT, which is an anionic double-chained surfactant,
is derived by its wide applications in cosmetic industries, emulsion
and biochemistry, and so forth.22 Till
date, most commonly investigated surfactants in DES systems includes
anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic n-alkyltrimethylammonium bromides (CnTAB).2,11−15 This could be due to their good solubility and well-established
micellization behavior in the aqueous medium. On the other hand, AOT
has never been tested for aggregation in DESs or their mixtures with
water. AOT favors inverse micelle formation in oil systems23 although it does also micellize in water.24 A low solubility of AOT in water, above which
it forms liquid crystalline phases,25 increases
its likelihood to undergo microscopic phase separation or nanosegregation
in already nanostructured DESs19 having
a strong hydrogen bonding network. Therefore, it seems very important
to understand the aggregation behavior of AOT in these novel nanostructured
solvents for future applications.

The nature of forces governing
aggregation are evaluated in terms
of Kamlet–Taft polarity parameters (π*, β, and
α) and cohesiveness of solvents provided by Gordon parameter
(G) and ced. These parameters are correlated with
the ability of investigated solvent systems to promote self-assembly
of amphiphile. 1H NMR and 1H–1H 2D NOESY spectroscopy are employed to get a detailed picture of
prevailing interactions in the investigated systems. This along with
previous reports on solvent structure of DESs and their mixtures with
water19−21 helped in understanding exceptional aggregation behavior
of AOT in DES–water (30 or 50% w/w) as compared to that in
water.

Results
Interfacial behavior of AOT in DESs and their
mixtures with water
(10, 30, and 50% of water, w/w %) is investigated using tensiometry.
Thus, obtained concentration profiles of surface tension, γ,
are shown in Figure 1A,B. In the absence of AOT, surface tension, γ0,
of DES–water mixtures is found to be higher as compared to
that of neat DESs. Observed values of γ for neat DES are compared
with the literature (Table 1).11,26−28 γ0 increases with the increase in water content as can be seen
from Table 1. The systems
involving Ethaline exhibit lower values of γ0 as
compared to those having Reline in neat DESs or at any similar composition.

Using concentration profiles
of γ, critical aggregation concentration
(cac) of AOT in DESs and their respective mixtures with water is obtained
as a concentration of AOT corresponding to the onset of plateau in
γ as shown in Figure 1. Various parameters such as surface tension at cac (γcac), surface pressure at air–solution interface (πcac), Gibbs surface excess (Γmax), and minimum
surface area per molecule (Amin) are derived
from profiles of γ using standard equations and are documented
in Table 1. In brief,
πcac is calculated as difference of surface tension
of pure solvent (γ0) to that at cac (γcac). Γmax and Amin are deduced using the following equations29 1   2  where n = 2 for ionic surfactant, R and T have their usual meanings, and NA is
Avogadro’s number. It is assumed
that AOT is fully dissociated in investigated solvents although there
might be a effect of strong cat-anionic interactions between AOT and
weakly hydrated choline cations in DESs having higher water content.

Thus obtained values of γcac increases with the
water content, till a water content of 30% (w/w), in respective DES–water
mixtures. Beyond that, γcac decreases marginally
only in the case of Reline. Further, γcac is found
to be higher in the case of Ethaline–water mixtures as compared
to that in Reline–water mixtures. πcac, which
gives efficiency of surfactant to reduce γ of solvent, is found
to increase with the increase in the content of water in respective
DESs. On comparing both solvent systems in neat or at any composition
with water, it is observed that πcac is higher in
the case of Reline. Γmax increases with the increase
in the content of water in the DES system, whereas for same (w/w)
% of water in DESs, the order of Γmax is water >
Reline > Ethaline. In bulk, aggregation of AOT is monitored by
conductivity
and fluorescence measurements. The value of cac is obtained from variation
of conductivity as a break point corresponding to sharp change in
conductivity profile (Figure 2).29 As can be seen from Figure 2, with the addition
of a surfactant to neat DESs, conductivity increases with a greater
slope which follows a relatively lower slope after cac.

Figure 2 Variation of
specific conductance, κ, as a function of concentration
of AOT at 298.15 K in (A–C) Reline, 10% (w/w) water mixture,
30% (w/w) water mixture, respectively; (D–F) Ethaline, 10%
(w/w) water mixture, 30% (w/w) water mixture, respectively.

However, in the presence of water,
conductivity either decreases
with a lower slope or remains almost unchanged on the addition of
a surfactant till cac is reached, after which it decreases with a
greater slope (Figure 2). A decrease in conductivity with addition of AOT is similar to
that reported in literature for aggregation of SDS in a mixed solvent
system of calcium nitrate tetrahydrate + acetamide melts.30 It is well known that the ratio of first (I1) to third (I3)
vibronic bands (I1/I3) of pyrene fluorescence is very sensitive toward solvent
polarity of cybotactic region and is generally used to determine micropolarity
of solvent along with cac of surfactants.31Figure 3A shows a
decrease in intensity of vibronic bands of pyrene with increase in
concentration of AOT. The variation of I1/I3 as a function of concentration of
AOT in DESs and their mixtures with water is shown in Figure 3B–D.

mixture; and (D) Ethaline–water (30 and 50%, w/w) mixture at
298.15 K. Arrows represent their respective cac values.

With an increase in the content of water in DESs,
the value of I1/I3 decreases in
the absence of AOT (Table 2). For the investigated DESs and DES–water mixtures,
variation of I1/I3 as a function of concentration of AOT follows a sigmoidal
pattern as generally observed for self-assembling surfactant systems.32 The midpoint of transition is marked as cac
of AOT, and obtained values of cac are listed in Table 2 along with those obtained from
conductivity measurements. The value of cac of AOT in neat DESs (Reline
10.06 mM and Ethaline 15.52 mM) is relatively higher as compared to
their mixtures with water and decreases with the increase in the content
of water. On the other hand, in neat Ethaline and its mixtures with
water, AOT exhibits a higher value of cac as compared to systems involving
Reline. Interestingly, AOT is found to aggregate at much lower concentrations
in DES–water mixtures (30 or 50%, w/w) as compared to that
in water.

c Conductivity method. Average cac
is average of cac obtained from fluorescence and conductivity measurements.

Here, in DES–water systems
(30%, w/w), cac of AOT drops
to 2.3 and 6.24 mM for Reline and Ethaline, respectively, which is
close to that observed in water, at least in the case of Reline. A
further increase in water content up to 50% (w/w) in Reline and Ethaline
decreases cac values to 0.94 and 1.36 mM, respectively. Different
characteristic parameters of solvent such as polarity, Gordon parameter
(G), and ced have been reported to affect the aggregation
behavior of surfactants.32−35 Therefore, these parameters are explored in this
study to have insight into the specific forces governing aggregation
of AOT in DESs or their mixtures with water. At first, polarity parameter
(I1/I3) using
pyrene fluorescence has been measured, a lower value of which, signifies
higher hydrophobicity of the cybotactic region around fluorophore
(Table 2). Polarity
of solvent systems under investigation is also probed by evaluating
Kamlet–Taft parameters, which involves π* (polarizability),
β (H-bond acceptor ability, HBA), and α (H-bond donor
ability, HBD) using 4-nitroanisole, 4-nitroaniline, and 4-carbomethoxy-1-ethylpyridinium
iodide as probes, respectively, and correlated with the observed values
of cac. The shifts in λmax of the probes in different
solvents (as provided in Figure S1 and S2, Supporting Information) is used to determine the parameters by using following
equations36 3   4   5   6  

The obtained values of π*, β, and α in DESs and
their mixtures with water are provided in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Kamlet–Taft values are quite
consistent with the literature reports,37 and slight inconsistency is assigned to use of different probes. Figure 4 shows the variation
of π*, β, and α as a function of water (w/w) % in
DESs.

α as a function of water (w/w) % in (A) Reline; and (B) Ethaline
at 298.15 K. Values in parentheses denote their respective average
cac values obtained from fluorescence and conductivity measurements.

Further, cohesiveness of solvent
is considered to probe the aggregation
behavior as high cohesiveness is generally related with aggregation
promoting capacity of given solvent.32−35 The cohesion in a solvent involves
various interactions such as dispersion, dipole interactions, repulsion
interactions, and so forth, between like molecules and is given by
Gordon parameter (G), which is calculated using following
equation32−34 7  where γ is surface tension and Vm is molar volume of solvent. The value of densities
employed to derive Vm, values of Vm and G are provided in Table
S2 (Supporting Information). Value of G for neat Ethaline is found to be consistent with the literature
report,38 but inconsistency with the literature
is observed in the case of Reline. A discrepancy in the obtained values
of G in the case of Reline as compared to that reported
in literature11 stems out from different
values of surface tension used to calculate G (discussed
later). Similarly, ced, which is the energy required to remove unit
volume of molecules from their neighbors to infinite separation by
disrupting interactions between same molecules present in solution
phase is calculated for solvent systems under investigation. Even
a small expansion in volume has a significant effect on these interactions;
therefore, enthalpy of vaporization (ΔlgHmo) is considered as a good measure
of ced,39 which can be determined using
surface tension, γ, and molar volume, Vm, of the solvent employing following expressions 8   9  where NA is Avogadro’s
number and A and B are constants
with values of 0.01121 and 2.4 kJ mol–1 at 298.15
K, respectively. This equation has been successfully tested to evaluate
ΔlgHmo and ced of the ILs with very satisfactory results.40 The obtained values of ced are provided in Table S3 (Supporting Information). Variation of G as a function of water content (w/w) % in DESs is shown
in Figure 5.

of as a function of water (w/w) % in (A) Reline and (B) Ethaline.
Values in parentheses denote their respective average cac values obtained
from fluorescence and conductivity measurements. Lines are just a
guide for eye.

1H NMR and 1H–1H 2D NOESY
spectroscopy has been employed to investigate changes in the solvent
structure, which is correlated with variation in characteristic properties
of aggregation. The obtained spectra are shown in Figures 6 and 7.

Figure 6 Expanded 1H NMR spectra of various protons of DESs along
with their mixtures in (A) Reline and (B) Ethaline at 298.15 K.

spectra of (A) Reline;
(B) 50% (w/w) Reline–water mixture; (C) Ethaline; and (D) 50%
(w/w) Ethaline–water mixture.

A change in chemical shift of different protons of DESs as
a function
of the water content in DESs reflects a change in the environment
of components of DES. In the case of Reline, all four protons of urea
appeared as a singlet in 1H NMR spectra and show a continuous
up-field shift along with peak broadening while moving from neat DES
to DES–water (50% w/w) mixture (Figure 6A). An up-field shift, varying in magnitude,
is also observed for all protons of cholinium ion present in Reline.
As compared to other protons −CH3 group protons
at position (1) exhibit maximum up-field shift in Reline–water
(50% w/w) mixture as compared to neat Reline. Further, 2D 1H–1H NOESY measurements shows that correlation
peaks originating from the interaction of protons of water and urea
becomes more and more stronger with increasing water content in Reline
(Figures 7 and S5, Supporting Information).

In the case of
Ethaline, protons of EG at position (2) and that
of cholinium ion at position (4) experience marginal downfield shift
with addition of water (Figure 6B). On the other hand, protons at positions (1) and (3) of
cholinium ion shifts up-field while going from Ethaline to Ethaline–water
(50% w/w) mixture (Figure 6B). However, the change in the chemical shift for all protons
of cholinium ion in Ethaline is nearly half to that observed in the
case of Reline.

Further, to have insight into the size of formed
aggregates and
the presence of dimers or trimmers below cac, dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements were performed at different concentrations of AOT
in DESs and their mixtures with water (Figure 8A–D).

Figure 8 Number weighted size distribution of aggregates
formed in (A) Reline
and (B) Ethaline along with their water mixtures at 298.15 K obtained
from DLS measurements. Variation of Dh as a function of concentration of amphiphile in (C) Reline and (D)
Ethaline.

There are various assumptions
that must be followed for highly
reliable DLS measurements. These include nonabsorption of light by
the particles, reduced multiple scattering, dilute solutions, exact
values of viscosity, and refractive index of the solutions. The present
systems comply most of these assumptions as the investigated systems
do not have any chromophore, which could absorb light at the wavelength
of photon (535 nm) used. The effect of multiple scattering is reduced
by using a quartz cuvette of small volume (75 μL) and samples
were measured at very low concentration of surfactant. The values
of required parameters such as viscosity and refractive index of solution
were measured and used for calculations by software. Two different
types of data fitting, that is, cummulant and distribution fit were
tested to extract the size. Only the size corresponding to the best
fit is reported. The observed profiles of the hydrodynamic diameter
(Dh) are shown in Figure 8A,B. It is observed that formed aggregates
of AOT in neat DESs are relatively small (Dh ≈ 50 nm in Reline and ∼34 nm in the case of Ethaline)
as compared to that in water (Dh ≈
120 nm). In the case of Reline, Dh of
aggregates of AOT decreases with the addition of water till 10% (w/w)
of water to ≈35 nm, after which it increases marginally to
≈50 nm at water content of 50% (w/w). On the other hand, in
the case of Ethaline, Dh remains almost
constant with change in composition of the DES–water mixture.
Further, to check the effect of concentration of AOT on the size of
aggregate, DLS experiments have been performed at 3 and 6 times of
cac.

Discussions
The γ for Reline comes out to be 53.1
mN/m, which is consistent
with literature reports26−28 however is much lower than at
least one instance reported in the literature.11 The varying sensitivity of method used in the present work
(du Noüy ring) and that reported in the literature (drop shape
method) could be a reason for the same. No doubt our results are reproducible;
however, it is important to mention that drop shape method is better
for measurements of surface tension of such viscous solvents as viscosity
do not affect the shape of the drop. On the other hand, viscous forces
could affect weight of the liquid film immediately beneath the ring
as well as shape of meniscus during detachment of ring when γ
is measured using du Noüy ring method. γ for Reline and
Reline–water mixtures is found to be higher than Ethaline and
Ethaline–water mixtures because of dominance of donor–donor
H-bonding interactions in Ethaline over Reline. A larger value of
γ in the case of DES–water mixtures as compared to neat
DESs is ascribed to high surface tension of water. However, it seems
that the interactional phenomenon between DESs and water is complex16 which affects γ. Small amounts of water
when added to DESs (ChCl/urea/water = 1:2:1.44 or ChCl/EG/water =
1:2:1.46) increases γ, whereas γ decreases when water
was added to ChCl/MalAc in a molar ratio of 1:1:2 or 1:1:5.16

A decrease in γ with a relatively
steeper slope with addition
of AOT in the case of DESs can be assigned to interaction of the AOT
chains with the cholinium cation. The γcac is more
in the case of systems having Ethaline and is affected by (i) surface
pressure, π, and (ii) the adsorption of surfactant and its orientation
at air–solution interface. An increase in surface pressure
generally results in the decrease in γ of solution, which is
contrary to the obtained results. In the present case, an increase
in π with the addition of water is due to increased values of
γ0 and hence cannot be correlated with γcac. Further, the role of orientation of AOT at air–solution
interface is ruled out based on decreasing values of Amin with increase in the water content. The marginal increase
in values of γcac with the increase in water content
in both DES–water systems indicate relatively lesser change
in surface structure of solvents in the presence of water. Further,
a higher value of πcac in the case of Reline as compared
to Ethaline at any investigated composition is attributed to higher
surface tension of Reline. An increase in Γmax with
the increase in the content of water signifies increased compactness
at the air–solution interface, which is more in the case of
Reline as compared to Ethaline. This could be due to the more perpendicular
alignment of the amphiphile at air–solution interface in the
presence of water in mixed solvents. It is quite probable that the
increased content of water weakens the interactions between different
components of DESs at the cost of increased interactions of DES components
with water.19−21 An observed increase in γ with increasing water
content supports this and suggests the greater occupancy of the air–water
interface by water in DES–water mixtures. It has been established
that the structural network of Ethaline is dominated by structural
organization of EG41 similar to glycerol
in Glyceline.42 Therefore, even in the
presence of water, this network would be less disturbed as compared
to that in Reline and presence of intermolecularly H-bonded EG in
vicinity of the air–solution interface in Ethaline and its
mixtures with water is expected. Such EG could interact with alkyl
chains of AOT, leading to less perpendicular arrangement of AOT at
the air–solution interface resulting in higher values of Amin in the case of Ethaline and its mixtures
with water. It seems that aggregation of AOT in such complex solvents
(DES or DES–water mixtures) may not be similar to that observed
in the aqueous medium, and the solvent structure both at air–solution
interface as well as in bulk is expected to affect surface behavior.

An increase in conductivity with addition of AOT in neat DESs is
attributed to relatively weaker interactions between surfactant ions
and either of the components of DESs. Therefore, the presence of the
surfactant ion along with its counterion contributes to the increase
in conductivity following a relatively higher slope, which increases
with a lower slope after cac. This shows that AOT forms self-assembled
structures in neat DESs similar to that formed by surfactants however
could be different in composition, but without any nanophase segregation.
As discussed before, the addition of water disrupts nanostructured
domains of DESs,19−21 wherein components of DES are expected to compete
with water to interact with AOT. Alkyl chains of AOT are more likely
to interact with EG and alkyl groups of cholinium cation via solvophobic
interactions, whereas water could solvate the anionic surfactant head
interacting with positively charged cholinium ion. On similar lines,
components of Reline could interact with AOT with the exception of
urea which remain solvated by water and do not interacts with AOT,
as suggested by NMR spectroscopy measurements (discussed later). This
results in nanosegregation of AOT complexed with water and DESs, which
removes the ionic surfactant from solution and results in a lesser
change or decrease in conductivity as can be seen form Figure 2. It is inferred that AOT self-assembles
similar to that of normal surfactants in DESs however undergoes nanosegregation
in mixtures of DESs and water exhibiting complex structural dynamics
depending on content of water. It is important to mention that nanosegregation
of AOT in the investigated concentration range for surface tension
measurements is not expected as the concentration corresponding to
cac observed from surface tension measurements is quite low as compared
to that observed form other techniques.

In bulk, the values
of cac are obtained from break point in variation
of γ (Figure 1), conductivity (Figure 2), and fluorescence (Figure 3) using pyrene as the polarity sensitive probe. The
values of cac obtained from profiles of γ come out to be very
low as compared to that obtained from other techniques. This is because
of the fact that different techniques sense different stages of aggregation
and have varying sensitivity. Further, it is quite possible that surface
saturation of the DES–air interface by surfactant occurs at
much lower concentration as compared to aggregation in bulk in these
viscous solvents similar to that reported earlier for other surfactants
in DESs systems.2,14 Therefore, the concentration
of AOT corresponding to surface saturation is denoted as C1. Further the absence of any sort of structured assemblies
around C1 is confirmed from DLS measurements
(Figure 8). In highly
viscous systems that is, pure DES and DES–water (10 w/w) system,
there is some difference in values of cac obtained from conductivity
and fluorescence measurements. This might be due to reduced mobility
of amphiphile ions in nanosegregated domains formed by AOT complexed
with water and components of DESs. The viscous nature of investigated
solvents may also affect the partition of pyrene into aggregates in
fluorescence measurements.

A higher value of cac in neat DESs
as compared to that observed
in their mixtures with water is consistent with literature reports
that aggregation behavior is less favorable in a nonaqueous medium
or cosolvent such as EG, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methanol-modified
water systems.32,43 The presence of enhanced hydrophobic
interactions with nanostructured domains of neat DESs, the content
of which decreases with addition of water, could delay cac. Greater
solvophobicity offered by H-bonded EG, which preserves its structure
in Ethaline–water mixtures, to hydrophobic AOT having less
solubility in polar solvents, leads to delay in cac as compared to
that observed in Reline at every composition of DES–water mixtures.
A lower value of I1/I3 in the case of the Reline system supports our assumption.
The role of van der Waals interactions between alkyl chain of AOT
and −CH2 groups present in EG and choline chloride
cannot be ruled out. With the increase in the content of water, electrostatic
interactions between the cholinium cation and AOT head group enhances
at the cost of decreased interactions between cholinium and EG/urea
as observed from NMR measurements (discussed later). This results
in screening of electrostatic repulsions between AOT head groups,
leading to decrease in cac. This situation is similar to the formation
of mixed micellar systems where negatively charged amphiphile and
positively charged choline behaves as a cat-anionic surfactant system.44−47 Both DESs exhibit relatively higher value of I1/I3 (Reline ≈ 2.26, Ethaline
≈ 1.96) as compared to that of water (∼1.7), which indicates
relatively higher polarity of neat DESs as sensed by the fluorescence
probe. This is in contrast with the higher value of cac in neat DESs
as compared to that observed in water and suggests that the cac is
mainly affected by inherent structure of DESs. Further, with the addition
of water, I1/I3 decreases from 2.25 (Reline) to 2.01 (Reline–water, 50% w/w),
whereas it changes marginally (1.96–1.93) in the case of the
Ethaline–water system but still remains more as compared to
that of water (∼1.7). It has been established that medium with
higher polarity favors self-assembly; therefore, cac of AOT should
be lower in the case of DESs or their mixtures with water as compared
to that in water. However, this is not the case at least from polarity
point of view as AOT has limited solubility in water25 and it favors to undergo micellization in the nonpolar
medium.23 Therefore, AOT is not expected
to form micelles in DES–water systems with high polarity, which
supports our claim of nanosegregation of AOT in DES–water mixtures.

In continuation, Kamlet–Taft Parameters were calculated
for all investigated DES systems. π*, β, and α values
for neat DESs are more in the case of Reline as compared to Ethaline.
Higher value of π* suggests higher ionic character of Reline
as compared to Ethaline, which is ascribed to the polar nature of
urea present in Reline. Similarly, Reline exhibits higher H-bond donor
and acceptor capacity as compared to Ethaline as indicated by higher
value of α and β, respectively. This is in line with the
fact that the H-bonding structure of hydroxyl donors such EG and glycerol
dominates the structural network of DES formed with choline chloride.41,42 Therefore, the lower value of cac in Reline is in line with the
reported literature where higher values of π*, β, and
α supports self-assembly of amphiphiles.11 Further, it can be seen from Figure 2A,B that π*, which is a measure of
the ionic character of solvent, increases with the increase in the
water content in DESs. It has been established that the presence of
water decreases H-bonding interactions between constituents of DESs
at the cost of enhanced H-bonding interactions between water and components
of DESs.19 This reduces the viscosity and
stabilizes the ionic character of the solvent. A decrease in interactions
between constituent ions of DESs in the presence of water is supported
by increased conductivity with the increased content of water in the
absence of AOT (Figure 2). On the other hand, α and β decrease with the increase
in the water content in respective DES–water mixtures, which
signifies a decrease in H-bonding capability of the solvent11,36 and is due to establishment of stronger interactions between water
and components of DESs. This increases the solvophobic effect leading
to lowering of cac with the increase in the content of water. However
as discussed earlier, cac for water does not follow the pattern followed
by π*, α, and β in DESs–water mixtures. It
remains somewhere close to cac observed for DES–water (30–50%)
mixtures, as can be seen from Figure 4.

A lower value of cac in Reline or Reline–water
mixtures
at all compositions as compared to Ethaline is also justified by the
higher value of G in the former case. With the addition
of water, G increases for both the systems under
investigation, which is reflected by the decrease in cac with the
increase in the water content. As can be seen from Figure S3 and Table
S3 (Supporting Information), similar to G, ced increases with the increase in the water content.
This supports the decrease in cac with the increase in the content
of water in both the investigated systems.48 On comparing G and ced of Ethaline and Reline,
it is observed that both exhibit comparable or even better G and ced as compared to organic solvents or ILs tested
so far as medium for self-assembly (Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information).49−55 Therefore, it is expected that Reline and Ethaline could be considered
as better self-assembly media as compared to organic solvents or even
ILs.

Interestingly, water exhibits a higher value of G and ced as compared to DESs and their mixtures with water.
However,
cac of AOT in water lies somewhere closer to that observed in the
case of DES–water (30 and 50% w/w) mixtures, which otherwise
should be lowest. Similar observations have been made from various
polarity parameters where cac of AOT in water does not fall in line
with the observed value of these parameters. It is obvious that polarity
as well as cohesiveness of investigated solvents governs aggregation,
as cac decreases with the change in solvent parameters as expected.
However, cac lower than that observed in the case of water, in the
case of DES–water (50% w/w), suggests that some additional
forces are promoting aggregation in DES–water mixtures having
higher content of water. The DESs–water mixture (50 w/w %)
behaves like a solution of components of DES in water19 wherein constituent ions (cholinium cation, Cl anion) or
compounds (EG, urea) could interact with AOT and thus affect the cac.
Therefore, enhanced ionic interactions between AOT anion and cholinium
cation in DES–water (50 w/w %) mixtures seems to assist in
nanosegregation of AOT at much lower concentrations, which is further
probed using NMR measurements.

A change in the chemical shift
of different protons of DESs as
a function of concentration of water in DESs is observed from 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 6 and S4, Supporting Information). This change occurs because of intrusion of water molecules into
the existing molecular arrangements19 in
neat DESs through differential hydration of various species comprising
DESs. An up-field shift of protons observed in the case of Reline
with the addition of water could be due to increasing H-bonding interactions
of urea with the water molecules. This results in confinement of urea
in H-bonded urea–water network (Figure 6A). Such confinement leads to a decrease
in spin–lattice relaxation time and leads to peak broadening.
An up-field shift can also be correlated to increased importance of
van der Waals interactions56 between weakly
hydrated nanostructured domains of cholinium ions. The absence of
cross peaks between protons of cholinium ion with either urea or water
in Reline–water mixtures supports the above assumption (Figures 7 and S5, Supporting Information). In the case of Ethaline,
increased H-bonding interaction of OH groups of EG and cholinium ion
with added water molecules results in marginal downfield shift of
protons of EG at position (2) and that of cholinium ion at position
(4), although EG is expected to preserves its structuring network.
On the other hand, decreased extent of interactions between EG and
cholinium ion at the cost of enhanced H-bonding interactions between
EG and water as well as cholinium ion and water results in up-field
shift of protons at positions (1) and (3) on moving from neat Ethaline
to 50% (w/w) Ethaline–water mixtures.

The above inference
is further supported by 2D 1H–1H NOESY
spectroscopy where the intensity of cross peaks for
interaction of cholinium ion protons with that of EG continuously
decreases with the increase the water content in Ethaline. At the
same time, new cross peaks originates signifying interactions between
water and EG as well as between water and cholinium ion protons. Moreover,
the change in chemical shift for all protons of cholinium ion in Ethaline
is nearly half of that observed in the case of Reline. This indicates
relatively less disruption in the solvent structure of Ethaline as
compared to Reline with the addition of water (Figure S5, Supporting Information). In addition, interactions
of water with urea in Reline are much stronger than those with EG
in Ethaline as depicted by the 2D 1H–1H NOESY spectra of two systems (Figures 7 and S5, Supporting Information). From the above discussion, it is inferred that cholinium ion remain
less hydrated in the case of Reline where water specifically bounds
to urea resulting in formation of weakly hydrated nanostructured domains
of cholinium ions. On the other hand, the presence of water does not
disturb internal structure of Ethaline to greater extent, where water
does not differentially hydrate cholinium ion and EG. Therefore, cholinium
ion remains more available to interact with oppositely charged AOT
in the case of Reline.

It is clear that Reline–water
(50 w/w %) behaves more like
a solvent system rich in electrolyte (segregated cholinium ion) and
urea, where the electrolyte is more free to interact with AOT. Such
interactions assist in nanosegregation via charge neutralization and
brings cac of AOT in Reline–water (50% w/w) mixtures to a value
even smaller than that observed in water. Similar phenomena happen
in the case of Ethaline but to a relatively smaller extent as compared
to that in Reline owing to lesser change in the solvent structure
by addition of water. It can be seen that Dh of aggregates of AOT (Figure 8A) in neat DESs is relatively less than that in water (∼120
nm). In Reline (∼56 nm), Dh of
aggregates are about 2.4 times less than water, whereas in Ethaline
(∼40 nm), Dh is 3 times less than
that observed in water. Dh of AOT aggregates
decreases with the decrease in the content of water in DES–water
mixtures. This is in line with variation of values of ced and G, suggesting that the solvent cohesion forces are governing
the aggregation of AOT. While considering polarity parameters of solvent,
a change in β with addition of water in DESs (Table S1, Supporting Information) is also in line with
the change in Dh of AOT aggregates. This
suggests that not only solvent cohesion but HBA ability of the solvents
also affects the size of formed aggregates. Further, the dimensions
of nanosegregates of AOT are larger than that observed for a normal
micelle, which could be due to complexation of AOT with different
components of DES depending on the nature of the component as discussed
earlier. Therefore, it is established that not only polarity and cohesiveness
of DESs or their mixtures with water govern self-assembly of amphiphiles
but other factors such as change in the solvent structure also play
an important role.57,58 Further, AOT does not self-assemble
in the form of smaller aggregates such as premicelles as observed
from DLS measurements performed at concentrations much below cac (Figure 8). As can be seen
from Figure 8C,D, there
is a marginal increase in Dh with the
increase in the concentration of AOT. The increase in Dh could reflect both growth of aggregates in size and
effects of interaggregate hydrodynamic interactions. It is observed
that Dh increases relatively more in the
case of water rich DES–water mixtures, which suggests the growth
of nanosegregates.

Conclusion
Present work along with
earlier reported work on self-assembly
of surfactants in DESs2,14−18 provides ample evidence of aggregation of AOT in
two commonly used DESs namely Reline and Ethaline as well as their
mixtures with water. AOT is found to self-assemble in a contrasting
manner in neat DESs and their mixtures with water, where AOT forms
micelle-like aggregates in neat DESs and undergoes nanosegregation
in DES–water mixtures. The different extent of perturbation
of the inherent structure of DES by water in two DESs led to varying
characteristic properties of aggregation that include cac and types
of self-assembled structures. Various polarity parameters and cohesion
forces in different systems are found to directly correlate with observed
cac values. The only exception is the observance of much lower cac
value in DES–water (50%, w/w) mixtures as compared to that
with water. It is established that DESs–water mixtures at higher
water content (30 and 50% w/w) behave similar to concentrated aqueous
solution of components of DESs, where weakly hydrated cholinium ion
remains more available to interact with AOT resulting in relatively
hydrophobic nanosegregates at much lower concentrations. The observed
behavior of the complex DES–water mixture as simple concentrated
aqueous solution of DES components at higher water content resulting
in the formation of nanosegregated domains of marginally hydrophilic
surfactant would offer a new platform to investigate such systems
from the view point of basic understanding and their applications.
Therefore, it is expected that the present work would not only provide
new insights into the field of colloid and interface science but also
find a place for various applications related to controlled photophysical
properties,58 catalysis,59 and nanoscience owing to presence of differentially hydrated
segregates in DESs–water mixtures.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
Choline chloride (≥99%),
urea (≥99%), AOT (≥99%), 4-nitroaniline (≥99%),
4-carbomethoxy-1-ethylpyridinium iodide (97%), and pyrene (≥98%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; 4-nitroanisole (98%) was purchased
from TCI chemicals, India. EG (99%) was purchased from Loba Chemie,
India, and used as received.

Before performing physicochemical
measurements, DESs under investigation, that is, Reline and Ethaline
were prepared by mixing choline chloride and urea as well as choline
chloride and EG in the molar ratio of 1:2 under stirring for 4–5
h at 70 °C until clear and homogenous mixtures were obtained.26 Thus prepared DESs were then cooled to room
temperature and dried under vacuum for 48 h to remove moisture. The
water content in synthesized DESs, as indicated by Karl Fischer analysis,
was found to be less than 2000 ppm in both DESs. Synthesized DESs
were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy using a Brüker
Ascend 500 spectrometer (AVANCE III HD console) employing a sealed-glass
capillary placed inside a 5 mm NMR tube containing D2O
for lock purposes. Scheme 1 shows molecular structures of components of DESs and AOT.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structure of Components of Investigated DESs and AOT
Double-distilled deionized
water having resistivity ≥18
MΩ cm at 298.15 K obtained from Millipore water purification
systems was used for experiments. Appropriate amount of water was
added to make DES–water mixtures having water content of 10,
30, and 50% (w/w). All measurements were made by adding concentrated
solution of AOT prepared in DESs or DES–water mixtures to respective
DESs or DES–water mixtures by the titration method at 298.15
K, if not mentioned otherwise. After addition, the solutions were
stirred for 3–4 min for homogeneous mixing and equilibrated
for another 3–4 min before measurements. Surface tension (γ)
was measured using a Krüss easy dyne tensiometer equipped with
a thermostat with a temperature control of ±0.1 K using the ring
method. The accuracy for the measurement was 0.1 mN/m for water as
the solvent and 0.25 mN/m for other solvent systems. Specific conductance
(κ) was measured using a digital conductivity meter (Systronics
308) employing a cell of unit cell constant. The temperature of the
conductivity cell was controlled by using Julabo water thermostat
within ±0.1 K. Measurements were made in triplicate with an uncertainty
of 0.7%. Prior to the measurements, the conductivity cell was calibrated
using aqueous solutions of KCl of different concentrations. Steady-state
fluorescence measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer luminescence
spectrometer LS-55 in a quartz cell of path length 1 cm. Pyrene was
used an external fluorescent probe at a concentration of 2 ×
10–6 M to prevent the formation of excimer. Measurements
were performed using an excitation wavelength of 334 nm, employing
an excitation and emission slit width of 2.5 nm, each in wavelength
range of 350–450 nm. The data were collected in duplicate with
an uncertainty of less than 0.5%. Temperature during measurement was
controlled using a built-in temperature controller within ±0.1
K. DLS measurements were performed on a light scattering apparatus
(Zetasizer, nanoseries, Nano ZS) from Malvern Instruments using a
quartz cuvette of path length 1 cm at a scattering angle of 173°.
Temperature during measurement was controlled using an built-in temperature
controller with an accuracy of ±0.1 K. An average of 10 measurements,
each consisting of 20 runs, was considered as an experimental data.
Data were analyzed using standard algorithms with an uncertainty of
less than 8%. DLS measurements were performed on solutions of AOT
at different concentrations ranging from below average value of cac,
to higher than cac obtained from different techniques. Density (ρ)
of solutions was measured using a vibrating-tube digital densimeter
(model: DMA 60/602, Anton Paar, Austria) with uncertainty 3 ×
10–3 kg m–3. Kamlet–Taft
parameters (π*, β, and α) for DESs and their mixtures
with water were determined by using 4-nitroanisole, 4-nitroaniline,
and 4-carbomethoxy-1-ethylpyridinium iodide, respectively. For this
purpose, UV–vis measurements were performed using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (UV-1800 SHIMADZU) in wavelength range 200–800
nm using a quartz cuvette of path length 1 cm. Stock solutions of
used probes (2 × 10–4 M) were prepared in ethanol.
An appropriate amount of stock solution was added to the cuvette and
ethanol was evaporated by purging nitrogen gas before the addition
of the solvent. This was followed by vigorous stirring to achieve
complete solubilization of probes in solvents. Final concentration
of probes in solvents was 5 × 10–6 M. The 1H–1H 2D NOESY experiment was recorded on
a Brüker Ascend 500 spectrometer (AVANCE III HD console) in
pure D2O in the case of 10% (w/w) water systems, whereas
for DES–water (30 and 50 w/w %) mixtures 35 and 20% (w/w) D2O–water systems were used, respectively.
