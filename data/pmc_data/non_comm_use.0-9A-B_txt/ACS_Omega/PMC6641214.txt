==== Body
Below is
a revised second paragraph
of Section 3.2.

3.2 GO Synthesis
Since
this dimanganese heptoxide (Mn2O7)
is very unstable and explosive in nature, the reaction temperature
was maintained below 5 °C during the addition of 6 g of KMnO4. After the addition of KMnO4, the solution was
transferred into an oil bath to maintain 55 °C temperature during
12 h of continuous stirring to oxidize the intercalated graphite compound.
