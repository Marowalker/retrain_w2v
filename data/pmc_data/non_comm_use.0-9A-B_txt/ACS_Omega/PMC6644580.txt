The physics behind the barriers to
internal rotation of acetyl
chloride (AC) molecule has been reported. The AC molecule closely
resembles the molecular structure of acetaldehyde; the only subtle
difference is the presence of a heavy chlorine atom in place of the
hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group for the latter. This paper aims
to study the effect of substitution of the heavy chlorine atom on
the barrier energetics of the AC molecule. The reason behind the barrier
for the AC molecule has been estimated for the first time from the
unified approach using barrier energetics, natural bond orbital, nuclear
virial, and relaxation analyses using density functional theory, Car–Parrinello
molecular dynamics, and wavelet transform theory. Complete analyses
reveal the concomitant relaxations of both the in-plane Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds toward understanding the origin of the barrier due to internal
rotation for the AC molecule. The large negative value of “V6” further suggests that both the abovementioned
degrees of freedom are coupled with the −CH3 torsional
vibration of the molecule. The coupling matrix (H12) element has also been estimated. Time-resolved band
stretching frequencies of Cmethyl–C1 and
C1–Cl3 bonds of the AC molecule, as obtained
from wavelet transformation analysis, primarily preclude the possibility
of coupling between the C1–Cl3 bond and
the torsional motion associated with the methyl group of the molecule.

1 Introduction
Molecular
conformations play important roles in the world of macromolecules,
whose structure–function relationship contributes significantly
toward understanding the basic physics and chemistry behind the functioning
of complex biological systems.1 A molecule,
in principle, can undergo conformational changes by internal rotation,
ideally about the concerned single bond/bonds. The text book example
of such internal rotation is observed in ethane, as it takes the stereoisomeric
eclipsed and staggered conformations with the change in the specific
dihedral angle. However, the real existence of this type of stereoisomeric
conformers apparently seems to depend explicitly on the torsional
angle τ.2 The barrier energy or height
that separates two distinct conformations is fundamentally the effect
of hindered rotation, stemming toward the concept of barrier potential.
Interestingly, the quantum mechanical nature of hindered rotation
was first identified by Nielsen in 1932.3 The theoretical results from his group provide the initial plunge
behind the phenomenal paper by Pitzer4 on
the internal rotation of the ethane molecule. Since then, the estimations
of barrier heights have been extended to other molecules involving
three- or even 6-fold barriers.5 The results
were primarily collected with the aid of microwave spectroscopy from
the splitting of rotational transitions into doublet, triplet, and
quadruplet structures because of the internal rotation of the rotor
group. Other experimental approaches to find barrier heights of conformeric
molecules are from Raman and far-infrared spectroscopic investigations.
For both these techniques, the torsional fundamental and overtone
vibrational signatures provide the means of such estimations.6 Moreover, fluorescence, supersonic jet-cooled,
and the analyses of hot bands from UV–vis electronic spectroscopy
also provide wealth of information toward the estimations of barriers
heights.7 Intriguingly, in the late fifties
and early sixties of the twentieth century, Wilson et al. implicitly
linked the origin of barrier heights with the electronic structures
of molecules.8 Understanding the origin
of rotational barriers from the electronic structures of molecules
was further facilitated by the advancement of quantum chemical calculations.9 However, increasing availabilities of faster
computations allow us to undergo in depth quantum mechanical studies
to elucidate the unexplored physics behind the origin of rotational
barriers. Goodman and his research group had accomplished remarkable
breakthrough in this area of research, where the nature of barrier
forces and the role of lone pairs toward understanding the internal
rotational barriers of molecules were explicitly studied for single
or double rotor systems.10 Recently, our
research group has estimated the origins of 3-fold rotational and
conformational barriers of ethyl propionate and isobutyl cyanide molecules
containing two methyl groups.11 The results
show that the involvement of both the bond length and skeletal angle
relaxations together play a prominent role in controlling the estimated
barrier heights of such molecules. However, the basic question still
remains: how to integrate the experimental results with the theoretical
understanding behind the genesis of internal rotational barriers of
conformeric molecules. The obvious way of fitting the experimental
transitions on a one-dimensional potential energy curve (PEC) as a
function of the torsional angle (τ) is elusive, considering
its multidimensional nature per se. The theoretical calculations supplement
the experimental observations with the inclusion of nontorsional degrees
of freedom of the molecules and provide a complete panorama toward
closer understanding of the origin of internal rotational barriers
of the molecules. The self-consistent field (SCF) calculations further
obey the variational principle toward the astute guesses of the minimum
energy configurations of the molecules.

As part of a series,
Guo and Goodman reported the nature of barrier
forces for the acetaldehyde molecule and highlighted the importance
of coupling between the methyl torsional and out-of-plane aldehyde
hydrogen wagging motions toward overall understanding of its barrier
origin.12 Considering the abovementioned
results in mind, here, we report the origin of rotational barriers
of acetyl chloride (AC) molecules, which have a very close resemblance
with those of acetaldehyde. Unlike acetaldehyde, in AC, the hydrogen
of the aldehyde group is replaced by the heavy chlorine (Cl) atom,
and we aim to study the effect of substitution on the barrier energetic
of the molecule. Substitution of the heavy chlorine atom in place
of hydrogen is expected to restrict the wagging motion of the C–Cl
bond and primarily preclude its possibility of coupling with the torsional
motion of the methyl group of the molecule. This paper is primarily
focused to unveil the origin of the internal rotational barrier of
the AC molecule for the first time from the unified approach using
barrier energetic, natural bond orbital, nuclear virial (NV), and
relaxation analyses. The Raman vibrational signatures and the corresponding
dynamic infrared (IR) spectrum of the molecule have been simulated
from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and from Car–Parrinello
molecular dynamics (CPMD), respectively. The barrier height of this
molecule is estimated from microwave and Raman spectroscopic studies
and is reported in the literature.13,14 The available
experimental results encourage us to elicit the origin behind the
barrier to the internal rotation for the AC molecule from theoretical
considerations.

2 Theoretical Calculations
All theoretical calculations were carried out using Gaussion-09
suit of the program mentioned in ref (15). Optimizations and vibrational frequencies of
the different rotameric forms of the AC molecule were computed from
Møller–Plesset perturbation by the MP2/6-21G(d) level
of theory. To understand the physics behind the methyl rotational
barrier of the AC molecule, the virial theorem16 has been satisfied using different basis sets ranging from
3-21G to aug-cc-pVTZ in the ab initio and in DFT calculations with
the B3LYP functional. However, the theorem is best satisfied at MP2/6-31G(d)
and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) levels of theory with ΔT + ΔE equals to 0.14 and 0.02 kcal/mol, respectively.
Thus, the origin of the methyl rotational barrier of the AC molecule
was carried out from DFT calculations using the B3LYP functional and
the 6-31G(d,p) basis set in addition to the ab initio MP2/6-21G(d)
level of theories. In this connection, it may be firmly mentioned
that reasonable barrier heights are reported to be reproducible for
many molecules even by HF calculations using a modest 6-31G (d,p)
basis set.11a,12

Ab initio molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations have been carried
out using the CPMD program17 with the pre-optimized
structure of the AC molecule. The CPMD approach is based on the electronic
optimization scheme, where a fictitious electronic mass is assigned
to the propagating orbitals of the electrons. The two component quantum/classical
problems are mapped onto a two-component purely classical problem,
with two separate energy scales at the expense of losing the explicit
time-dependence of the quantum subsystem dynamics.18 The structure of the AC molecule is placed at the center
of a simple cubic cell of dimension 10.0 × 10.0 × 10.0 Å3. The NVT ensemble has been chosen to execute the simulation
at room temperature over an equilibrium time of 100 ps. The time step
was set to 4.0 au that corresponds to ∼0.096 fs. The temperature
of the ensemble was controlled through the Nose–Hoover thermostat.19 An electronic fictitious mass parameter of 500
a. u. has been used in the simulation run. The gradient-corrected
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional20 has been utilized to model the electronic exchange and correlation
factors. Core electrons were treated with pseudo potentials of Troullier
and Martins,21 while valance electrons
were represented by the plane-wave basis set truncated at an extended
energy cutoff of 80 Ry.

The vibrational signatures of the molecule
are obtained from time-dependent
molecular dynamics trajectories, with the aid of Fourier transformations.
From CPMD trajectories, the stretching distances of atoms as a function
of time, associated with the vibrational modes of the molecule, are
extracted. The vibrational density of states (VDOS) of the respective
normal modes is then obtained from Fourier transformation. Wavelet
transform is then employed to estimate the frequency–time plot
for individual normal modes of vibration of the molecule.

The
algorithm adopted to compute wavelet transform Wn(s) in the Fourier
space is expressed as22 1  where ωk is the angular frequency
for the kth normal mode
and F̂k and ψ̂
are the Fourier transformations of the time series Fn and the mother wavelet ψ(t), respectively. The mother wavelet ψ(t) is represented as 2  where the parameters
ω0 and
σ are set as reported elsewhere.23 The functional form of eq 2 is given by the Morlet function, and Kirby and Swain24 proved that it reproduces the Fourier power
spectrum.

The IR spectrum of the AC molecule has been estimated
from “on
the fly” dynamics. The dynamic IR spectrum of the AC molecule
has been simulated from Fourier transform of the dipole moment autocorrelation
function (DMAF). The detailed description of DMAF is given in the Supporting Information.

3 Results
and Discussion
The optimized structures of the AC molecule
are shown in Figure 1. The molecule exists
in eclipsed (E) and in staggered (S) conformations. The simulated
Raman and IR spectra, as obtained from the MP2 level of theory, are
shown in Figure 2a,b,
respectively. The differential Raman scattering cross-section (dσ/dΩ)
values have been estimated from the scattering activities using the
relationship25 3  where β = 1/KBT,  represents the Raman
scattering factor
(in Å4/amu) of the molecule excited with “ith” wavelength expressed in nanometers. The expression Si is calculated at the equilibrium
geometry, and it is the expression of derivatives in terms of static
isotropic (α) and anisotropic (γ) polarizabilities.

simulation studies.

The spectra, as shown
in Figure 2a,b, are
marked by the appearance of well-resolved
Raman and IR bands in the entire spectral window ranging from 0 to
3000 cm–1. Insets of Figure 2a,b further mark the presence of low-frequency
vibrational signatures centered at ∼164 and 163 cm–1, respectively. This band is ascribed to the torsional vibration
stemming from the methyl—CH3 top of the AC molecule.
The result is in accordance with the experimental observation as reported
by Durig et al. from the Raman spectrum of the molecule reported in
the solid state.13

The simulated
dynamic IR spectrum of the AC molecule has been also
estimated from “on the fly” CPMD simulation studies.
The spectrum is shown in Figure 2c. The theoretically simulated IR spectrum, as obtained
from CPMD calculation, is also marked by the presence of a broad hump
centered at ∼149 cm–1 in the low wavenumber
region. This band, albeit weak, has been identified with the torsional
vibration of the molecule centered at 166, 164, and 163 cm–1 in the experimental and theoretically simulated Raman and IR spectra,
respectively, as obtained from the MP2 calculations. The IR spectrum,
as obtained from CPMD simulations, however, appears to differ especially
in the 1250–2000 cm–1 with the corresponding
spectrum as estimated from the MP2 level of theory. The reason for
this difference may be partly owing to the anharmonicity of the vibrations.
However, the other probable explanation may be the effect of finite
fictitious electronic mass parameters that is considered in the CPMD
simulation run.26 The effect of finite
fictitious electron mass makes the moving nuclei effectively heavier.
The velocity or the DMAF averaged over a period of time and the corresponding
dynamic IR spectrum of the molecule are highly mass-dependent quantities.
The effect of the finite fictitious electron mass thus has a direct
impact on the vibrational wavenumbers as estimated from CPMD simulations
in comparison with that calculated from the MP2 level of theory. Hence,
the anharmonicity of the vibrations together with the effect of finite
fictitious electron mass (making the moving nuclei heavier) effectively
make the IR spectra calculated at MP2 and CPMD level of theories look
so different.

The shape of the PEC associated with the methyl
rotation of the
AC molecule has been estimated as a function of O2–C1–Cmethyl–C4 torsional
angle (τ). The PEC is shown in Figure S1. The bottom and the top of the barrier in the PEC correspond to
the “E” and “S” conformers of the AC molecule,
respectively. The optimized structural parameters of “E”
and “S” forms of the AC molecule, as obtained from ab
initio, DFT, and CPMD calculations, are shown in Table S1. The central carbon Cmethyl atom of the
−CH3 group in the AC molecule is ∼sp3-hybridized with the relevant bond angle ∼110.61°,
110.55°, and 109.98° as obtained from MP2/6-21G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d,p),
and CPMD level of theories, respectively. The Cartesian displacement
of the abovementioned vibrational signature is also shown in Figure 2a. The torsional
frequency of the methyl—CH3 group is utilized to
estimate the 3-fold (V3) rotational barrier
of the molecule by using the relation we used before10a 4  where
ν is the torsional frequency and Ir is the reduced moment of inertia of the methyl
(−CH3) group with respect to the center of gravity
of the AC molecule. The 3-fold barrier (V3) to internal rotation for the −CH3 group of the
AC molecule is estimated to be ∼1.32 and 1.31 kcal/mol using
MP2/6-21G(d) and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theories, respectively.

The classical approach to envisage the rotational barriers of molecules
containing a single rotor is the obvious expansion of the hindered
potential function V(τ) in the Fourier series
for various torsional angles (τ). It is represented as 5  

The methyl group of the AC molecule has 3-fold
symmetry, and the
equivalent configurations reproduce themselves through permutations
of the three hydrogen atoms. Thus, only the odd components survive
in the abovementioned expression 5, which takes
the following form. 6  

The term “V3” determines
the height of the barrier, while its shape is intimately linked with
the term “V6”. The shape
of the barrier “V6” is related
with the dynamics and splitting of energy levels, as the response
behavior to the torsional tunneling. The “V6” term is much less than “V3” and contributes even less than 3% of it. Because
“V9” carries no special
physical significance and as V9 ≪ V3, the abovementioned series is truncated up
to “V6”.

Table S2 shows the values of Vi (i = 3,
6) for the internal rotation of the methyl—CH3 of
the AC molecule. It is seen from Table S2 that “V3” as obtained
from the fitting function (vide supra) is in close harmony with that
estimated from torsional vibration of the Raman spectrum of the AC
molecule.13 The “V6” value has been estimated to be −0.019
kcal/mol. The negative sign of “V6” for the AC molecule is in accordance with that reported
by Kudich et al.,27 where the values of
“V6” had been predicted
to vary between −10.5 and −11.4 cm–1, depending upon the level of theories computed over different basis
sets. In this connection, it is also worth to mention that for the
acetaldehyde molecule, the sign of the corresponding “V6” term is also negative28 for fully relaxed optimizations, signifying strong coupling
of methyl torsion with the out-of-plane γ (Caldehyde–H) wagging motion of the molecule. However, in general, the
negative sign of “V6” affects
the shape of the barrier; it deepens the potential well, narrows the
barrier, and decreases the torsional energy levels of the rotor.

To understand the primary origin of the 3-fold (V3) rotational barrier of the AC molecule, the effects
of strain within the molecule have been estimated from the generalized
virial theorem. The generalized virial theorem29 provides a simple yet elegant route for understanding the
origin behind the barriers.

Accordingly 7  where ∑αχ⃗αF⃗α is the
NV and the summation signifies the sum over contribution of the nucleus
α to the virial of force acting on the electrons. The position
vector of the nucleus α is χ⃗α, and F⃗α = ∇⃗αE is the net force acting on it.

The variations of NV for rigid rotation (RR) and for the skeletal
relaxations alone or in combination as a function of torsion angle
(τ) are shown separately in Figure 3a,b using DFT and ab initio levels of theories,
respectively. Interestingly, both the levels of theory are almost
reproducible and exhibit similar observations, as apparent from Figure 3a,b. From Figure 3 it is seen that,
NV monotonically increases with τ on going from “E”
to “S” in the case of RR for the −CH3 group of the AC molecule. The increasing value of the NV, as the
torsional angle τ proceeds toward 60°, may signify that
the molecule is left in a strained metastable state in the “S”
conformation. However, with the inclusion of the out-of -plane Cmethyl–H skeletal flexing, the NV shows an antagonistic
behavior with respect to RR. Interestingly, when Cmethyl–C1 is allowed to relax, NV initially increases
with τ, maximizes near 40°, and decreases again as τ
approaches toward “S” conformation. The NV, with the
inclusion of in-plane Cmethyl–H4 skeletal
flexing, again increases monotonically, similar to that observed for
the RR of the molecule, albeit its magnitude is small in comparison
to RR. However, when both the Cmethyl–C1 and in-plane Cmethyl–H4 flexing are
allowed to relax, keeping other degrees of freedom for the frozen
molecule, the variation of NVs as a function of τ closely resembles
that for RR. These results indicate that the strain generated in going
from E to S mainly arises from the combined effect of frozen Cmethyl–C1 and in-plane Cmethyl–H4 skeletal flexing of the AC molecule.

rotational barrier of the CH3 group
of the AC molecule using (a) B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and (b) MP2/6-21G(d)
level of theories.

To identify specific
importance of relaxations of the Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds alone or in combination
toward the stereoisomeric dispositions
of “E” to “S” conformations of the AC
molecule, the variations of Coulomb repulsion (ca. ΔVnn and ΔVee) and nuclear–electron attraction (ca. ΔVne) as a function of the torsion angle (τ) have
been considered. The variations are shown in Figure 4, as obtained from DFT and the ab initio
level of theories. Similar to the estimation of NVs, the variations
of potential energy differences for ΔVnn, ΔVee, and ΔVne as a function of τ, as obtained from
two different levels of theories are almost similar. For fully relaxed
rotations, ΔVne is the dominant
barrier forming the term, while ΔVnn and ΔVee contribute toward the
antibarrier energy [Figure 4a,A]. Interestingly, for RR, ΔVne turns out to the most prominent antibarrier-forming energy,
while the energy profiles for ΔVnn and ΔVee are almost superimposed
and collectively contribute to barrier formations [Figure 4b,B]. With the inclusion of
Cmethyl–C1 relaxation with the other
degrees of freedom of the frozen molecule, the variation of ΔVne with τ again exhibits barrier formation,
while both ΔVnn and ΔVee together contribute to the antibarrier [Figure 4c,C]. Interestingly,
with Cmethyl–H4 relaxation alone, similar
variations of ΔVnn, ΔVee, and ΔVne are observed as obtained from Cmethyl–C1 relaxation [Figure 4d,D]. The only notable difference is the overall decrease in the
barrier-forming energy associated with ΔVne. However, combinations of both Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds relaxation
faithfully reproduce the energy profile for the fully relaxed rotations
[Figure 4e,E and a,A].
These results thus indicate that both Cmethyl–C1 skeletal flexing together with the in-plane Cmethyl–H4 bond relaxations of the methyl group of the
AC molecule play a crucial role toward the genesis of the internal
rotational barrier of the AC molecule. The observation is not surprising;
the initial inklings were reflected from the variations of NVs, which
presage the co-existence of both Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bond relaxations to
be the cause of strain within the AC molecule as it undergoes conformational
changes from “E” to “S” configurations
(vide supra). Apart from understanding the origin behind the rotational
barrier of the molecule, the observations from the variations of NVs
and the dissected energies further reveal the multidimensional character
of the hindered potential. The hindered potential is thus not only
an explicit function of τ, but it is strongly coupled with the
flexing of Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds of the AC molecule.

(a,A) fully relaxed, (b,B) RR, (c,C) in-plane
Cmethyl–C1 relax, (d,D) in-plane Cmethyl–H4 relax, and (e,E) in-plane Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 skeletal flexing of the AC molecule.

The coupling of Cmethyl–C1 and
Cmethyl–H4 bonds with the torsion angle
τ
of the AC molecule is further reflected from the algebraic sign of
the “V6” value. It is shown
in Table S2. The negative sign of “V6” for the AC molecule, in the case of
fully relaxed rotation, turns to a positive sign when both Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 relaxations are frozen simultaneously. The abovementioned coupling
results in large variations of the in-plane bending C1–Cmethyl–H4 angle (associated with Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bond relaxations) with τ, as shown in Figure S2a, further corroborate the abovementioned conjecture.
Interestingly, the associated angles with other degrees of freedom
of the AC molecule (ca. C1–Cmethyl–H5, C1–Cmethyl–H6, and Cmethyl–C1–Cl3) do not undergo significant variations with τ as depicted
in Figure S2b–d. These results substantiate
weak involvement of C1–Cmethyl–H5, C1–Cmethyl–H6, and Cmethyl–C1–Cl3 angles toward the origin of the barrier due to the internal rotation
of the AC molecule.

The coupling matrix (H12) element for
the Cmethyl–H4 relaxation has been envisaged
using the relation28 8  

The H12 has been estimated to
be 74.73
and 78.58 cm–1 as obtained from DFT and ab initio
levels of theories, respectively. The large value of H12 suggests strong coupling between torsion and in-plane
β(Cmethyl–H4) bending of the AC
molecule.

Thus, unlike acetaldehyde, the reason behind the rotational
barrier
for the AC molecule is mainly owing to the flexing of in-plane Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bond relaxations, and both of them are coupled with the −CH3 torsional vibration of the molecule. For acetaldehyde, the
origin of the barrier is mainly attributed to the in-plane skeletal
Cmethyl–Cald flexing together with the
involvement of −(Cald–H) out-of-plane relaxation,
involving its aldehyde group. In this connection, it is important
to mention that in the AC molecule, the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde  group of the acetaldehyde
molecule is replaced by a heavy chlorine atom. The increased inertia
of the heavy chlorine atom attached to the  group in the AC molecule
is expected to provide impediment toward the relaxation of the C1–Cl3 bond. This conjecture is reflected
while eliciting the barrier origin of the AC molecule, which involves
the skeletal relaxations and the relaxations of the Cmethyl–H4 bond only, involving the rotor −CH3 group of the molecule. The weak involvement of H5 and H6 atoms to the potential energy barrier of the AC
molecule may be rationalized from the electronic effect. The inclusion
of the out-of-plane Cmethyl–H skeletal flexing (involving
both Cmethyl–H5 and Cmethyl–H6 bonds) and the variation of NV as a function
of torsion angle (τ) show an antagonistic behavior with respect
to RR [Figure 3]. Moreover,
we checked the calculations and estimated the variations of potential
energy differences for ΔVnn, ΔVee, and ΔVne as a function of “τ”. The out-of-plane Cmethyl–H relaxations, involving H5 and H6 atoms, do not reproduce the energy profile for the fully
relaxed rotation. They are shown in Figure S3. Both these observations signify that H5 and H6 are not relevant to the potential energy barrier of the AC molecule.

The electronic structure of the AC molecule in terms of natural
bond orbitals (NBOs) primarily comprises three C–H, one C–C,
one C–Cl, and two C–O (one σ and one π)
bonds, together with two and three localized lone-pair electrons on
the oxygen and chlorine atoms, respectively. Bonding and the lone-pair
NBOs contribute to 99.1, 99.11% of the electronic charge in the E,
S forms of the AC molecule. To understand the weak involvement of
H5 and H6 atoms to the potential energy barrier
of the AC molecule from the electronic effect, the principal bond
energy changes (Δω) associated with the internal rotations
of the −CH3 group of the molecule have been considered.
Accordingly 9  where εT, ρT and εB, ρB are the NBO energies,
electron occupancies corresponding to the staggered (S) and eclipsed
(E) forms of the AC molecule, respectively.11b,12 The bond energy changes associated with the −CH3 group of the molecule are shown in Table 1. From Table 1, it has been observed that for fully relaxed rotation,
the barrier-forming terms for the −CH3 group of
the AC molecule arises from Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds. Significant bond
energy changes (Δω) have been noted for Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds in the case of RRs with respect to fully relaxed ones. Interestingly,
when Cmethyl–C1 together with Cmethyl–H4 bonds are allowed to relax, the change in bond
energies (Δω) of the Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds closely mimic
the energies as obtained for fully relaxed rotation. These results
further corroborate our earlier conjecture which presages the involvement
of both Cmethyl–C1 skeletal flexing along
with the in-plane relaxations of Cmethyl–H4 bond toward the origin of the barrier due to the internal rotation
of the AC molecule (vide ante). However, the effect of combined relaxations
of Cmethyl–H5 and Cmethyl–H6 shows not only small changes in bond energies for the Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds but exhibits antagonistic behavior with respect to
the fully relaxed rotation. The abovementioned results thus signify
that involvements of H5 and H6 atoms are very
weak and are not relevant to the potential energy barrier of the AC
molecule.

To introspect an in-depth analysis
leading to the origin of the
barrier of the AC molecule, the evolution of Cmethyl–C1, Cmethyl–H4, Cmethyl–H5, Cmethyl–H6, C1–Cl3 bond lengths, and C1–Cmethyl–H4 bond angles with time have been
estimated from CPMD simulations. The fluctuations of the respective
bond lengths and bond angles in the picosecond time scales are shown
in the left panel of Figure 5. The corresponding frequency count of the respective Cmethyl–C1, Cmethyl–H4, C1–Cl3, Cmethyl–H5, Cmethyl–H6 bond lengths, and
C1–Cmethyl–H4 bond
angles are also shown in the right panel of Figure 5. The inset of Figure 5A–F shows the respective mean values
and the standard deviations (SD) of bond lengths and bond angles with
respect to the average peak of the distributions. A closer look of
the SD values provides interesting observations. It is clearly seen
that the SD values exhibiting fluctuations for in-plane Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bond lengths are relatively higher (almost 10 times) in comparison
to those for C1–Cl3, Cmethyl–H5, and Cmethyl–H6 bond relaxations. These results further confer the relaxed degrees
of freedoms which Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bond lengths experience more in
comparison to those of C1–Cl3, Cmethyl–H5, and Cmethyl–H6 bonds. The relaxed degrees of freedom for in-plane Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bond length flexings are in turn coupled with the torsional
vibration of the rotor −CH3 group, resulting in
the origin of the barrier to the internal rotation of the AC molecule.
The involvement of the in-plane relaxation of the Cmethyl–H4 bond results in the variation of the associated
angle C1–Cmethyl–H4 which also exhibits a considerable SD value with respect to the
equilibrium bond angle of the molecule, settled at ∼106.56°
[Figure 5].

Cmethyl–C1, (b,B) Cmethyl–H4, (c,C) C1–Cl3, (d,D) Cmethyl–H5, (e,E) Cmethyl–H6 bond lengths, and (f,F) C1–Cmethyl–H4 bond angle of the AC molecule as obtained from the CPMD calculations.

The VDOS of the Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–Cl3 stretching modes have been mapped
in the configuration space from wavelet transform and are shown in Figure 6b,c, respectively.
Prior to that, the energy of the system has been allowed to equilibrate
over 0–100 ps to approximately identify the time scale from
where the system accomplishes equilibrium configuration. The corresponding
energy versus time plot is shown in Figure 6a. The time coordinate is marked with the
vertical dotted line, beyond which the system remains in equilibrium.
It is clearly seen from Figure 6b,c that under equilibrium conditions, the vibrational stretching
frequencies of ν(Cmethyl–C1) and
ν(Cmethyl–Cl3) vary between ∼823
to 960 and 460–464 cm–1, respectively. These
results again signify that the flexing of the Cmethyl–C1 bond is quite large in comparison to Cmethyl–Cl3.

3.1 Understanding the Origin
behind the Barrier
from NBO Analyses
As the attractive component of potential
energy ΔVne turns out to be the
prominent barrier-forming term for the AC molecule (vide ante), the
hyperconjugative or the delocalization energy changes (ΔEdeloc) due to rotations of the −CH3 group of the AC molecule have been estimated. The change
in attractive potential energy ΔVne can be linked with the transfer of electrons per se as the hyperconjugative
or delocalization (ΔEdeloc) energy
changes.10b The NBO analyses involve the
estimations of all possible interactions between “filled”
(donor) Lewis type NBOs and “empty” (acceptor) non-Lewis
NBOs, by considering their energetic importance using second-order
perturbation theory.30,31 For each donor NBO (i) and acceptor (j), the stabilization energy ΔEij(2) associated with delocalization i → j is represented as 10  where F̂ is the Fock
operator, and ϵi and ϵj correspond to the energy eigen states of
|ψi⟩ and |ψj⟩ molecular orbitals, respectively.

The principal bond–antibond interaction energies related to
the internal rotational barrier between “E” and “S”
forms of the AC molecule are shown in Table 2. The prominent barrier-forming energy is
noted for Cmethyl–H4(σ)/C1–Cl3(σ)* interactions, undergoing significant change in
stabilization energy ΔEij(2) = ≈
3.32 kcal/mol. The 2D-contour plots of the orbitals involved in bond–antibond
Cmethyl–H4(σ)/C1–Cl3(σ)* interactions for “E” and “S”
forms of the AC molecule, as obtained from DFT calculation is shown
in Figure 7. From Figure 7, it is seen that
the Cmethyl–H4(σ) bonding and the
C1–Cl3(σ)* antibonding orbitals
show a favorable overlap in the region of the Cmethyl–C1 bond for the “E” form (Fi,j = 0.056 au) of the AC
molecule leading to the charge transfer interactions from the methyl
group to the C1–Cl3 fragment of the molecule.
The same orbital, for the “S” conformer of the AC molecule,
however, exhibits a relatively weak overlap (Fi,j = 0.036 au) in the region
of the abovementioned σ bond. The abovementioned result signifies
that the flexing of the Cmethyl–C1 bond
may thus be explained by considering favorable Cmethyl–H4(σ)/C1–Cl3(σ)* bonding
and antibonding overlap around the Cmethyl–C1 bond region for the “E” conformer in comparison
to that of its “S” form associated with the methyl internal
rotation of the AC molecule. Thus, the effect of hyperconjugation
associated with Cmethyl–H4(σ)/C1–Cl3(σ)* bond–antibond interactions
plays an effective role toward the relaxations of both Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds which in turn coupled with the methyl torsion and contribute
toward the origin of barrier due to the internal rotation of the AC
molecule.

4 Conclusions
The origin of the rotational barrier for the AC molecule has been
explored for the first time from the NV, relaxation effects, and natural
bond orbital (NBO) analysis techniques. The NVs, dissection of energies,
and NBO analyses all confirm the multidimensional character of the
hindered potential of the concerned molecule. The hindered potential
is found not only to be an explicit function of torsional angle (τ)
but is strongly coupled with the flexing of Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds of the
molecule. The available experimental results for the AC molecule further
encourage us to harmonize the experimentally estimated 3-fold rotational
barrier (V3) of the molecule with the
theoretically predicted result. The large negative value of “V6” signifies coupling of Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bond relaxations with the −CH3 torsional vibration
of the molecule. The coupling matrix (H12) element as obtained from DFT and ab initio levels of theories both
substantiate the abovementioned conjecture. Substitution of a heavy
chlorine atom and its restricted motion is reflected from the time-resolved
band stretching frequency of the C1–Cl3 bond of the AC molecule, as obtained from wavelet transformation
analyses. Theoretical methodologies finally reveal that the relaxations
of both the in-plane Cmethyl–C1 and Cmethyl–H4 bonds together play a significant
role toward understanding the barrier to internal rotation for the
AC molecule.
