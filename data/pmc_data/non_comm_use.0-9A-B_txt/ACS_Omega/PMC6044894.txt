The
cross-linked pentapeptides (2R,7R)-diaminooctanedioyl-bis(Tyr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Tyr-amide) ((2R,7R)-BVD-74D, (2R,7R)-1) and octanedioyl-bis(Tyr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Tyr-amide)
(2) as well as the pentapeptide Ac-Tyr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Tyr-amide
(3) were previously described as neuropeptide Y Y4 receptor (Y4R) partial agonists. Here, we report
on a series of analogues of (2R,7R)-1 and 2 in which Arg2, Leu3, or Arg4 were replaced by the respective aza-amino
acids. The replacement of Arg2 in 3 with a
carbamoylated arginine building block and the extension of the N-terminus
by an additional arginine led to the high-affinity hexapeptide Ac-Arg-Tyr-Nω-[(4-aminobutyl)aminocarbonyl]Arg-Leu-Arg-Tyr-amide
(35), which was used as a precursor for a d-amino
acid scan. The target compounds were investigated for Y4R functional activity in assays with complementary readouts: aequorin
Ca2+ and β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 assays.
In contrast to the parent compounds, which are Y4R agonists,
several ligands were able to suppress the effect elicited by the endogenous
ligand pancreatic polypeptide and therefore represent a novel class
of peptide Y4R antagonists.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Among
the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors, designated Y1R, Y2R, Y4R, and Y5R,1 the Y4R plays a special role because
it preferentially binds pancreatic polypeptide.2 Compared to the Y1R, Y2R, and Y5R subtypes, fewer ligands by far (e.g., see Figure 1) have been reported for the
Y4R, in particular, high-affinity Y4R antagonists
are still lacking.3−6

Figure 1 Amino
acid sequence of human PP and structures of the described
NPY Y4R agonists 1–3 and
the Y1R/Y4R antagonist UR-MK188 (4).

Y4R agonists are considered
to be potential antiobesity
agents.7,8 The diastereomeric mixture of the cross-linked
(“dimeric”) pentapeptide 1 (BVD-74D), a
mimic of the C-terminus of pancreatic polypeptide, was described as
a high-affinity Y4R agonist,4 having an effect on food intake in mice.9 As reported previously, (2R,7R)-1 (note: in the following, positions 2 and 7 refer
to the stereo centers in the 2,7-diaminosuberic acid moiety) was,
by a factor of 3–10, more potent than (2S,7S)-1, depending on the type of assay.10,11 Even though Y4R agonists should have higher clinical
potential, antagonists are of interest as well, in particular, as
pharmacological tools. The pentapeptide 3,6 a Y4R agonist with an affinity in
the two-digit nanomolar range (Ki = 50
nM), shares the same amino acid sequence with the peptide moieties
of 1. The incorporation of cyclic β-amino acids
such as (1R,2S)-2-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic
acid resulted in partial agonism.6

To investigate the impact of backbone modifications in Y4R agonists on functional activity in more detail, additional analogues
of (2R,7R)-1, 2,11 and 3 were prepared.
Here, we report on the synthesis of Y4R ligands in which
aza-amino acids or d-amino acids were introduced. The title
compounds were characterized in binding and functional cellular assays
with complementary readouts.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
Aza-peptides contain at
least one amino acid in which the α-carbon atom is replaced
by nitrogen.12 The semicarbazide substructure
reduces conformational flexibility.13,14 Several studies
have revealed that the incorporation of aza-amino acids into bioactive
peptides may result in a longer duration of action or higher potencies
compared to the parent peptide.15−17 Aza-peptides can be prepared
by the reaction of an N-protected, N′-substituted hydrazine
with an isocyanate.12 However, the synthesis
of aza-peptides on a solid phase is compromised by an intramolecular
side-reaction of resin-bound isocyanates that results in the formation
of hydantoins (Figure 2A), lowering the yields of the target compounds and requiring time-consuming
purification.18 To circumvent hydantoin
formation, N-Fmoc-aza1-dipeptides were
prepared from N-protected, N′-substituted hydrazines and benzyl
ester-protected amino acids, followed by hydrogenolytic debenzylation
in solution (Figure 2B).19

Figure 2 Synthesis of aza-peptides on a solid phase
(A) or in solution (B).

Two different Fmoc-protected hydrazines were synthesized
to mimic
the side chains of Orn or Leu, respectively (Scheme 1). 3-Aminopropan-1-ol was Boc-protected and
subsequently oxidized under Parikh–Döring conditions
using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an oxidant to form the aldehyde 7. Condensation of (9H-fluoren-9-yl)methyl
hydrazinecarboxylate 8 and the aldehyde 7 or isobutyric aldehyde resulted in hydrazones 9 and 11. Subsequent reduction using sodium cyanotrihydridoborate
gave access to the substituted hydrazines 10 and 12.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Hydrazines 10 and 12
Reagents and conditions: (a)
Boc2O, Na2CO3, tetrahydrofuran (THF),
0 °C, 10 min, followed by room temperature (rt), 14 h; (b) sulfur
trioxide pyridine complex, DMSO, triethylamine (TEA), CH2Cl2, 0 °C, 1 h, followed by rt, 3 h; (c) Fmoc-Cl,
MeCN/H2O (1:1), 0 °C, 10 min, followed by rt, 12 h;
(d) 7, CH2Cl2, 14 h; (e) isobutyraldehyde,
CH2Cl2, 50 h; (f) sodium cyanotrihydridoborate,
CH2Cl2/MeOH (4:3), 2 M HCl (pH 2–3),
rt, 2–6 h.

The benzyl ester-protected
amino acids 14–16 were treated with
triphosgene to give the respective isocyanates
in situ (Scheme 2).
Without purification, the isocyanates were treated with hydrazines 10 and 12 affording the benzyl-protected N-Fmoc-aza1-dipeptides in yields >70%. Subsequent
ester cleavage by hydrogenation gave access to the N-Fmoc-aza1-dipeptides Fmoc-aza-Leu-Arg(Pbf)-OH (17), Fmoc-aza-Orn(Boc)-Tyr(tBu)-OH (18), and Fmoc-aza-Orn(Boc)-Leu-OH (19). The dipeptides 17–19 were employed in solid phase synthesis
under the same conditions as those for the standard Fmoc-protected
amino acids, resulting in quantitative coupling efficiencies.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of the N-Fmoc-aza1-dipeptides 17–19
Reagents
and conditions: (a)
Benzyl alcohol, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (4-DMAP), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC), CH2Cl2, rt, 14 h, followed by DEA/CH2Cl2 (1:8), rt; (b) triphosgene, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), CH2Cl2, rt, 90 min, followed by Pd/C, H2, MeOH,
rt, 1 h.

To optimize the coupling of a resin-bound
aza1-peptide,
the model peptide H-Ala-aza-Leu-Arg(Pbf)-NH2 (20) was synthesized under various conditions (Scheme 3). When 3-[bis(dimethylamino)methyliumyl]-3H-benzotriazol-1-oxide hexafluorophosphate/hydroxybenzotriazole
(HBTU/HOBt) was used as coupling reagent at 35 °C, only 5–10%
of the desired products were formed. The same holds for the application
of the succinimidyl ester, Fmoc-Ala-OSu. The coupling efficiency was
increased to approximately 50% when the 7-aza-benzotriazole derivative
HATU was used as coupling reagent. The best results (>50% coupling
efficiency) were achieved by in situ activation of Fmoc-Ala-OH to
the corresponding acyl chloride using triphosgene in THF. Surprisingly,
when CH2Cl2 was used as a solvent instead of
THF, only minor amounts of 20 were detected.

Scheme 3 Incorporation
of aza-Leu into the Model Peptide 20 via
SPPS
Reagents and conditions: (a)
SPPS (Fmoc strategy), 17/HBTU/HOBt/DIPEA (3/3/3/6 equiv),
solvent DMF, 35 °C, 14 h; Fmoc deprotection was carried out with
20% piperidine in DMF/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)
(8:2), rt, 2 × 10 min; (b) variation of the conditions according
to the table; Fmoc deprotection as under (a); (c) Fmoc deprotection,
followed by CH2Cl2/trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
(97:3), 10 × 6 min.

The dimeric aza-peptide
(2R,7R)-26, an aza-Leu
analogue of (2R,7R)-1, was prepared from the protected pentapeptide 21 and
the diacid (R,R)-24 (Scheme 4). For the
preparation of the aza-peptides 27–31, octanedioic acid disuccinimidyl ester (25) was used
for cross-linking. Cross-linking of 21 with 25 yielded the dimeric aza-peptide 27, an aza-Leu
analogue of 2. Dimerization of the protected peptides 22 and 23 resulted in the aza-peptides 28 and 30 containing ornithine instead of arginine.
Subsequently, guanidinylation was performed with N,N′-di-Boc-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine
resulting in 29 and 31, which were aza-Arg-containing
analogues of 2.

DMF/NMP (8:2), “double” coupling at rt, 60 min or dipeptide
(17, 18, or 19)/HBTU/HOBt/DIPEA

(f) TFA/H2O (95:5), rt, 2.5 h; (g) N,N’-di-Boc-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine,
DMF, DIPEA, rt, 4 h; Boc-deprotection, TFA/CH2Cl2/H2O (10/10/1), rt, 3 h.

Very
recently, we reported that the replacement of Arg2 with
the Nω-carbamoylated arginine 32 (Figure 3) in one of the pentapeptide chains of 2 led to increased
Y4R affinity.11 Similarly, 32 was used for the preparation of peptides 33–42 (Figure 4), which are analogues of the pentapeptide 3, on an Fmoc-Sieber-PS resin by manual SPPS according to the Fmoc
strategy.

arginine building block 32.20

Figure 4 Primary structures of all investigated peptides.

Finally, the applicability of 32 to the preparation
of cyclic peptides via head-to-side-chain cyclization was investigated.
Cyclic peptides are structurally more constrained than their linear
counterparts and can mimic secondary structural elements of native
peptides or proteins. Additionally, cyclic peptides are less prone
to enzymatic degradation. The formation of head-to-tail cyclic peptides
is often compromised by rather rigid backbones. However, the side-chain
of 32 is very flexible, facilitating an approximation
of the activated C-terminus and the terminal amino group. The hexapeptide 43 was prepared on an H-l-Tyr(tBu)-2CT
resin followed by global side-chain deprotection (Scheme 5). Cyclization was achieved
at a peptide concentration of 1 mM using benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium
hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) as coupling reagent. Under these conditions,
the formation of peptide dimers was not observed.

(a) in Scheme 3; (b)

2.2 Competition Binding Studies
at NPY Receptor
Subtypes. Y4R Binding
The Ki values of all of the target compounds were determined in
competition binding studies on live cells expressing Y4R (CHO-hY4R-Gqi5-mtAEQ cells) using the radioligand
[3H]UR-KK193 (45, Figure 5) (Table 1, Figure 6).11 The affinities of the aza-peptides 27 (Ki = 134 nM), 29 (Ki = 52.7 nM), and 31 (Ki = 113 nM) were lower than the affinity of
the respective reference compound 2 (Ki = 3.5 nM). (R,R)-2,7-Diaminosuberic
acid was superior to octanedioic acid as a linker in the dimeric aza-peptides
(cf. (2R,7R)-26: Ki = 30.8 nM), as in the case of peptide 1 compared to 2. The aza-Orn precursors of 29 and 31, compounds 28 (Ki = 130 nM) and 30 (Ki = 385 nM), bind to the Y4R as well, though
with lower affinities compared to their aza-Arg counterparts.

Among the structural modifications
of pentapeptide 3, replacement of the N-terminal acetic
acid with octanoic acid (compound 33) resulted in an
increase in Y4R affinity by
a factor of almost six. The replacement of Arg2 in 3 with the carbamoylated arginine 32 was even
more favorable: the affinity of 34 (Ki = 19.5 nM) was 17-fold higher than the affinity of its
parent compound 3. Extension of the N-terminus by an
additional arginine led to a further increase in affinity: the Ki value of compound 35 was in the
single-digit nanomolar range (Ki = 2.87
nM). Up to now, comparable binding data were achieved only in the
case of cross-linked or significantly longer linear peptides. The
extension of the N-terminus of 3 by an additional arginine
alone had almost the same impact on Y4R affinity, that
is, 36 (Ki = 3.43 nM) showed
nearly the same affinity as peptide 35. Interestingly,
the replacement of the arginine adjacent to the C-terminus with the
modified arginine building block 32 was not tolerated
(37: Ki = 501 nM).

Following the structural optimization of 3, a d-amino acid scan was performed with the hexapeptide 35. Whereas replacement of Arg1 or Tyr2 with d-Arg or d-Tyr, respectively, was tolerated (cf. 41, 42), replacement of Leu4, Arg5, or Tyr6 by the corresponding d-amino
acid led to a marked decrease in Y4R affinity (cf. 38–40).

Previous studies revealed
that C-terminal amidation is crucial
for Y4R binding of the endogenous ligand hPP.21 Similarly, the affinity of the carboxylic acid 43 (IC50 > 5000 nM) was much lower than the
affinity
of the amide 35. Cyclization of 43 resulted
in an increase in Y4R affinity. However, the cyclic peptide 44 (Ki = 1650 nM) was only a weak
binder compared to the linear analogue 35.

2.3 NPY Receptor Subtype Selectivity
Ki values of all of the target compounds
were also determined at the Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors using the radioligands [3H]propionyl-pNPY
(Y2R and Y5R) or [3H]UR-MK136 (46, Y1R, Figure 5). Neither the linear peptides 34–43 nor the cyclic peptide 44 displayed remarkable
affinity to the Y1, Y2, or Y5 receptors.
Having a more than 1000-fold selectivity for the Y4R over
the other NPY receptors, peptide 35 proved to be superior
to (2R,7R)-1 and 2. Only the pentapeptide 33 bound to the Y1R with a Ki value in the submicromolar
range (Ki (Y1R) = 589 nM),
that is, the lipophilic N-terminal octanoyl residue is disadvantageous
with respect to Y4R selectivity.

The cross-linked
aza-peptides (2R,7R)-26, 27, and 29 displayed only low Y1R, Y2R, and Y5R affinities, whereas the affinity
of 31 (Ki = 53 nM) at the
Y1R was markedly higher than that of the peptide analogue 2. In a Fura-2 Ca2+ assay on human erythroleukemia
(HEL) cells, 31 revealed Y1R antagonism (Figure 7) with a Kb value of 11.5 nM.

assay. Mean ± SEM from three independent experiments.

2.4 Functional Studies at the
Y4R
The target compounds were investigated for
Y4R agonism
and antagonism in an aequorin Ca2+ assay as well as β-arrestin
1 and β-arrestin 2 recruitment assays on genetically engineered
CHO or HEK293T cells, respectively (for data see Table 2, Figures 8–10, SI Figures 1–8).

Data points shown for (A)–(C) are the mean ± SEM of at
least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

assay and a β-arrestin

and HEK293T-ARRB2-Y4R cells (β-arrestin 2, dashed
lines). Data points shown for (A) and (B) are the mean ± SEM
of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
Note: Inhibition of hPP-induced response appears incomplete, however,
concentrations of antagonists higher than those given in the curves
could not be applied due to a shortage of the test compounds. There
was no intrinsic activity of both compounds in the respective assays
when performed in the agonist mode (SI Figures 3, 5, and 7).

2.5 Y4R Agonism
(2R,7R)-1 was a partial agonist
in both the Ca2+ assay and the β-arrestin recruitment
assays (α = 0.62, (Ca2+ assay), α = 0.54 (β-arrestin
1) or 0.58 (β-arrestin 2), Figure 8A,C,E). The pentapeptides 33 and 34, and the hexapeptides 35 and 36, were partial agonists achieving between 44 and 78% of
the maximal response of hPP in both the calcium and the arrestin assay
(Figure 8). Y4R agonism was retained, though at a lower level, when d-amino
acids were introduced into the N-terminal part of 35 (cf. 41, 42; Figure 8). In contrast, the aza-peptides (2R,7R)-26, 27, and 31, the carbamoyl-Arg modified peptides 37–40, including those bearing d-amino acids in the
C-terminus (38–40), as well as the
cyclic hexapeptide 44 were devoid of Y4R agonism
in the aequorin Ca2+ assay and the β-arrestin recruitment
assays (SI Figures 2–7). The aza-peptide 29 displayed weak partial agonism with extremely low intrinsic
activity (EC50 = 542 nM, α = 0.07, (Ca2+ assay); EC50 = 875 nM, α = 0.09 (β-arrestin
1); EC50 = 473, α = 0.12 (β-arrestin 2)). Compounds
(2R,7R)-26 and 27 were also investigated for Y4R agonism in a
luciferase reporter gene assay. Surprisingly, both aza-peptides displayed
partial agonism in this assay (α = 0.81, EC50 = 176
nM ((2R,7R)-26), α
= 0.75, EC50 = 220 nM (27)). Functional assays
with distal readouts such as the luciferase reporter gene assay can
reflect pronounced signal amplifications. It should be taken into
account that the incubation period in the luciferase reporter gene
assays was 4.5 h compared to 60 min for the arrestin assays and a
few seconds in the case of the aequorin assay. Therefore, compounds
displaying negligible agonistic activity in assays with proximal readouts
may show much higher efficacies in reporter gene assays, as demonstrated,
for example, for histamine H4 receptor ligands.28 Likewise, (2R,7R)-1, a partial agonist in the Ca2+ assay
and the arrestin assay, appeared as a full agonist in the luciferase
assay.11

2.6 Y4R Antagonism
The incorporation
of aza-amino acids into the cross-linked peptides (2R,7R)-1 and 2 had an impact
on the quality of action. The dimeric aza-peptides (2R,7R)-26, 27, 29, and 31 were able to suppress the response elicited
by the endogenous ligand hPP (Figure 9, SI Figure 8). The introduction
of d-amino acids into the C-terminal tripeptide of 35 led to Y4R antagonism, with compound 40, in which Leu4 was replaced by d-Leu, displaying
the strongest antagonism in the Ca2+ assay (Table 2, SI Figure 8). Compound 37, in which Arg5 was
replaced by the carbamoylated arginine 32, and the cyclic
hexapeptide 44 were identified as weak Y4R
antagonists (Figure 10, SI Figure 1).

In summary, modification
of the C-terminal part of the monomeric and cross-linked peptide partial
agonists by the introduction of aza-amino acids or d-amino
acids as well as rigidization of the backbone by head-to-side-chain
cyclization changed the quality of action to antagonism in the aequorin
and β-arrestin assays. Unfortunately, these modifications went
along with a decrease in Y4R affinity. The EC50 values of the reported Y4R partial agonists (33–36, 41, 42) were substantially
higher than the Ki values. This effect
was previously discussed and can be attributed to the presence or
absence of sodium ions in the buffers.11,29

3 Conclusions
The affinity and potency of the Y4R partial agonist 3 was considerably increased by the
replacement of Arg2 with the carbamoylated arginine 32 and the introduction
of an additional arginine at the N-terminus. Several backbone modifications
of the C-terminal tripeptide (e.g., the introduction of aza-amino
acids or d-amino acids) of 35 as well as head-to-side-chain
cyclization changed the quality of action of the linear or dimeric
Y4R peptide ligands from partial agonism to antagonism.
The resulting compounds displayed weaker Y4R antagonism
than the reported Y4R antagonist 4. However,
due to their extremely facile synthetic accessibility, linear peptides
derived from 35 containing d-amino acids (e.g., 40 (Ki = 248 nM)) are promising
building blocks for further structural modifications and might pave
the way for the development of peptide Y4R antagonists
with increased affinity.

4.3 Chemistry: Experimental
Protocols and Analytical
Data. General Procedure for Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis
Peptides were synthesized by manual SPPS using the Fmoc strategy
on an Fmoc-Sieber-PS resin or an H-l-Tyr(tBu)-2CT resin (43) as described with minor modifications.
Five milliliters Discardit II syringes (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg,
Germany) were equipped with 35 μm polyethylene frits (Roland
Vetter Laborbedarf, Ammerbuch, Germany) and used as reaction vessels.
For the coupling of standard d- or l-amino acid
to the N-terminus of an amino acid or the amino group of the Fmoc-Sieber-PS
resin, DMF/NMP (8:2) was used as solvent. Fmoc amino acids (5-fold
excess) were preactivated with HBTU/HOBt/DIPEA (5/5/10 equiv) for
5 min and added to the resin. Double coupling at rt was performed
for all standard amino acids for 45 min. The coupling of the arginine
building block 32 and the dipeptides 17–19 (3-fold excess, preactivated with HBTU/HOBt/DIPEA (3/3/6
equiv)) was performed at 35 °C for 14 h (“single coupling”)
using anhydrous DMF as solvent. For the coupling of Fmoc amino acids
to a resin-bound aza-amino acid, triphosgene was used as the coupling
reagent. Triphosgene (1.75 equiv) was dissolved in anhydrous THF and
cooled to 0 °C. A solution of Fmoc amino acid (5 equiv) and DIPEA
(15 equiv) in anhydrous THF was added dropwise causing the formation
of a white precipitate. After addition, stirring was continued for
5 min. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was added
to the resin. Coupling was performed at 35 °C for 12 h.

After coupling was completed, the resin was washed with DMF/NMP and
treated with 20% piperidine in DMF/NMP (8:2) at rt (2×) for 10
min to remove the Fmoc group, followed by thorough washing of the
resin.

4.4 Cells
HEC-1B (HTB-113)
human endometrial
cancer cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville,
MD). MCF-7-Y1 cells were previously established in our
laboratory.23 HEL cells were kindly provided
by Dr. M. C. Michel (Universitätsklinikum Essen, Germany),
and CHO-K1 (ACC-110) cells and HEK293T (ACC 635) cells were from Deutsche
Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig,
Germany).

Routinely performed examinations for mycoplasma contamination

(ELuc) from the brazilian click-beetle Pyrearinus termitilluminans. The fusion construct of the human hY4R (the hY4R cDNA was from cDNA Resource Center, Bloomsburg, PA) and the C-terminal
luciferase fragment (hY4R-ELucC) was generated using the
previously described construct SSTR2-ELucC31,32 by replacing the cDNA of SSTR2 with the cDNA of the hY4R. HEK293T cells were stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1/myc-HIS
(B) vector encoding the β-arrestin isoform 1 or 2, N-terminally
fused with the N-terminus of the luciferase (ELucN-ARRB1 or ELucN-ARRB2,
respectively)31 and the pcDNA4/V5-HIS (B)
vector encoding hY4R-ELucC using G418 (600 μg/mL)
and zeocin (40 μg/mL) as selection antibiotics, as previously
described for the H1R.33 To
determine the hY4R-ELucC expression, saturation binding
studies were performed with both HEK293T-ARRB1-hY4R cells
and HEK293T-ARRB2-hY4R cells using the radioligand 45 (cf. SI Figures S6 and S7).

in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10%
FCS, 600 μg/mL G418, and 40 μg/mL zeocin.

4.6 Radioligand Binding Assays
Radioligand
binding assays at all NPY receptor subtypes were performed at 22 ±
1 °C according to the experimental protocols described in detail
previously.11 Radioactivity (dpm) was measured
with a MicroBeta2 plate counter (PerkinElmer, Rodgau, Germany). Cells,
buffers, radioligands, and the respective Kd values and concentrations, as well as the assay conditions are summarized

The assay
was performed on CHO-hY4-Gqi5-mtAEQ cells as
previously described26 using a GENios Pro
plate reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). Areas under the curve were
calculated using SigmaPlot 12.5 software (Systat Software Inc., Chicago,
IL).

4.9 Luciferase Assay
The Luciferase assay
was performed on HEK293-hY4-CRE Luc cells as previously
described.11

4.10 β-Arrestin
Recruitment Assay
The recruitment of β-arrestin was
measured via the split-luciferase
complementation technique.32 Agonist potencies
were determined on HEK293T-ARRB1-Y4R and HEK293T-ARRB2-Y4R cells using the GENios Pro microplate reader (Tecan, Salzburg,
Austria) as previously described for HEK293T-ARRB1-H1R
and HEK293T-ARRB2-H2R, respectively.33 For the determination of antagonism, the cells were preincubated
in the presence of the antagonist for 15 min. Ten microliters of an
hPP solution (30 nM, final concentration 3 nM) was added and incubation
was continued at 25 °C for 60 min. The plates were further processed
as in the case of the agonist mode.

4.11 Data
Analysis
Concentration response
curves from functional assays and displacement curves from radioligand
competition binding were analyzed by four-parameter sigmoidal fits
(GraphPad Prism 5.0, San Diego, CA). Agonist potencies are given as
EC50 values, intrinsic activities are expressed as α
values
with respect to the effect of 1 μM hPP (maximal response α
= 1.0). Antagonistic activities were determined in the presence of
3 nM hPP (β-arrestin 1/2 assay, EC50 = 3.54 nM (ARRB1),
EC50 = 2.74 nM (ARRB2)), 100 nM hPP (aequorin assay, EC50 = 9.7 nM) or 10 nM pNPY (Fura-2 Ca2+ assay, EC50 = 0.87 nM (Y1R)). Ki and Kb (Fura-2 Ca2+ (Y1R)) values were calculated from IC50 values using
the Cheng–Prusoff equation.36
