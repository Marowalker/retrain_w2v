The aluminum–water reaction is a promising source
for hydrogen
production. However, experimental studies of this reaction are difficult
because of the highly concentrated alkaline solution used to activate
the surface of aluminum. Here, we show that the reaction kinetics
can be monitored in real time by a Schottky diode sensor, consisting
of an ultrathin aluminum film deposited on a semiconductor substrate.
Charge resulting from the corrosion of the aluminum film causes an
electrical signal in the sensor, which is proportional to the rate
of the chemical process. We discuss the possible mechanisms for the
reaction-induced charge generation and transfer, as well as the use
of Schottky diode based sensors for operando studies of the aluminum–water
reaction and similar reactions on metals in concentrated alkaline
solutions.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the study
of hydrogen generation from chemical
reactions of metal particles with water has become increasingly relevant.1−3 One such reaction, often considered as a potential source of inexpensive
hydrogen for mobile energy sources, is the reaction of aluminum and
water (i.e., Al + 3H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3/2H2).4−7 The main advantages of aluminum as a source of hydrogen are high
activity, storage safety, ease of transportation, and renewability.8,9 Under normal conditions, the rate of Al–water reaction is
quite low because the aluminum surface is covered with a thin oxide
film that forms a so-called “barrier layer” that prevents
the interaction of H2O molecules with the Al surface.4 Thus, the Al–water reaction only occurs
in the presence of extremely caustic substances, such as NaOH and
KOH, which dissolve the oxide film and activate the Al surface to
interact with water molecules. Since the caustic base is not consumed
in the reaction, it can be considered as a catalyst for this process.
Also, a number of studies based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
show that the chemical reactivity of Al changes drastically in the
transition from microscopic particles to nanoparticles and clusters.3,10−12 Combining the results of these studies with experimental
data would be a significant step forward in engineering technology
for hydrogen production based on the Al–water reaction.

Given the nature of the Al–water reaction, studies of the
reaction mechanism can be carried out using conventional methods.
Among them are electrochemical methods that are simultaneously simple
and powerful.13 However, despite the advantages
of this technique, its application is possible only under the conditions
of the applied electric potential, which can lead to irreversible
changes in the studied medium (e.g., parallel electrochemical processes
may be triggered and form various by-products not related to the test
reaction, thus complicating the interpretation of experimental data).
In addition, electrochemical methods limit observation to the overall
reaction occurring in the reaction cell while making it impossible
to see certain stages of the reaction isolated from processes occurring
on other electrodes. Therefore, the development of new, noninvasive
experimental methods, in addition to those existing for operando studies
of the Al–water reaction under realistic reaction conditions,
gains special attention.

In this paper, we consider the effects
of charge transfer on the
surfaces of ultrathin Al films in concentrated NaOH solutions under
reaction conditions and discuss the possible use of these effects
for operando studies of the Al–water reaction. We show that
the reaction-induced generation and transfer of electrical charge
on the Al surface can be monitored by a Schottky nanodiode sensor
based on a metal–semiconductor contact. The principle of operation
of the sensor is illustrated in Figure 1a. An ultrathin metal film is placed on the surface
of a semiconductor substrate so that it creates a Schottky contact.
At equilibrium, the electrical current through the metal–semiconductor
contact is zero because the thermionic emission current flowing through
the Schottky contact in the forward and reverse directions is balanced.14,15 However, when a chemical reaction proceeds on the metal surface,
the equilibrium can be disturbed by the formation of excess charge,
which leads to the appearance of a nonzero electrical current.15−20 A number of research papers show that this current is proportional
to the reaction rate, which makes nanodiode sensors a convenient tool
for studying chemical kinetics on nanoscale metal structures.21−25 We may also note that various sensors based on Schottky diodes operating
by the above mechanism or other mechanisms have been reported for
a number of applications in both gas–metal and in liquid–metal
reactions.16,26−31

2 Results and Discussion
A schematic
cross section of a Schottky nanodiode sensor is shown
in Figure 1b. To ensure
reliable electrical contact with the sensor under the Al corrosion
conditions during its reaction with water, a thin layer of Au was
applied between the Al film and the semiconductor substrate. Thus,
the sensor is a three-layer structure: a chemically active Al film
on top, a Au layer in the middle, and a semiconductor substrate at
the bottom. A typical response of the 10 nm Al/10 nm Au/n-Si nanodiode
sensor to the Al–water reaction in a concentrated NaOH solution
is shown in Figure 2a. At the moment when the sensor first comes into contact with the
solution, a sharp current peak is observed (hereafter referred to
as the initial peak) that disappears after a few seconds. The polarity
of the initial peak corresponds to the transfer of an electron from
the metal to the semiconductor (i.e., it is a reverse (negative) current
through the Schottky contact). It is important to note that a similar
initial peak is also observed when the concentrated NaOH solution
interacts with 10 nm Au/n-Si nanodiode sensors. It is obvious that,
in this case, the chemical reaction does not occur on the sensor surface
due to the absence of aluminum. Thus, we presume that the initial
peak is caused by the charging of the sensor surface via adsorption
of ions from the NaOH solution. The double layer formed during this
process most likely causes electric charge redistribution at the metal–semiconductor
contact, which leads to the appearance of the initial peak. For further
analysis, the initial peak as a function of the NaOH concentration
in the solution was measured with a 10 nm Au/n-Si nanodiode sensor.
As shown in Figure 2b, the magnitude of the initial peak increases as the NaOH concentration
in the solution increases. This confirms the hypothesis about the
relationship between this current signal and the accumulation of charge
on the sensor surface.

10 nm Au/n-Si
nanodiode sensors immersed in concentrated NaOH solutions. (b) Initial
peaks measured from the 10 nm Au/n-Si nanodiode sensor in a concentrated
NaOH solution. (c) Reaction currents measured by the Al/Au/n-Si nanodiode
sensor with Au layer thicknesses varying from 10 to 40 nm. (d) Magnitude
of the initial peak and reaction current with varying thicknesses
of the Au layer.

After the initial peak, another type of current
signal can be detected.
This signal, hereafter referred to as the reaction current, flows
in the forward (positive) direction and corresponds to electron transfer
from the semiconductor to the metal. When the reaction current occurs,
gas bubbles appear on the sensor surface. The amount of gas generated
on the sensor with the 10 nm thick Al film is too small to analyze
its composition. However, a mass spectrometric study of the gas generated
in the Al–water reaction, carried out in a separate experiment
with thicker Al films and foils, indicates that the generated gas
is hydrogen (see Figure S2). Thus, we can
conclude that the appearance of bubbles on the sensor surface indicates
the onset of H2 evolution during the Al–water reaction.
The reaction current is only observed on the nanodiode sensors with
an Al film, and its magnitude shows a clear correlation with the reaction
rate, which can be determined from the rate of gas evolution. Thus,
we can conclude that the reaction current is a consequence of the
Al–water reaction. Based on this, and also for the sake of
simplicity in the following figures, we only show data related to
the reaction current, which is determined by subtracting the current
signals measured on nanodiode sensors with and without an Al film
in the same solution.

Figure 2c shows
the reaction current measured by the Al/Au/n-Si nanodiode sensors
with the thickness of the Au layer varying from 10 to 40 nm. The thickness
of the Al film was 10 nm for all the experiments. As can be seen,
the reaction current shows a clear dependence on the thickness of
the Au layer. This effect clearly indicates the nonthermal nature
of the reaction current.15,22 Thus, we can state
that the current observed in the nanodiode sensors during the Al–water
reaction does not result from the thermoelectric effect caused by
surface heating during the reaction. It can also be assumed that the
presence of an explicit dependence of the reaction current on the
metal thickness may indicate the participation of hot electrons in
the current generation process. The occurrence of the reaction current,
called a chemicurrent, due to the transfer of hot electrons in Schottky
nanodiodes is well known for exothermic reactions at both gas–metal21,22,32 and liquid–metal interfaces.29,33 Because of the scattering processes that occur when moving through
a metal film, a current of hot electrons usually demonstrates a strong
dependence on the thickness of the metal electrodes in nanodiode sensors.21,22 Thus, a similar process can be expected for the Al–water
reaction at the surface of the Al/Au/n-Si nanodiode sensors. It is
interesting to note that the dependence of the current on the thickness
of the metal film is also observed for the initial peak (see Figure 2d). Both the initial
peak and the reaction current can be described by the exponential
function I = I0 exp (
– d/λ) when plotted as a function of
the Au layer thickness, which is denoted as d. In Figure 2d, the fitting curves
are shown by the dashed lines. The attenuation length λ for
the Au/n-Si nanodiode sensors is two times larger than that for the
Al/Au/n-Si nanodiode sensors. This fact can be explained within the
framework of the hot electron transfer hypothesis by the more complex
structure of the metal–semiconductor interface in the Al/Au/n-Si
nanodiode sensors, which provides stronger scattering of the hot electron
flux.

In the most concentrated alkaline solution ([NaOH] = 1000
mM),
the reaction current reaches a significant peak value of 70 μA,
just a few seconds after the start of the experiment. As the concentration
of the solution decreases, the magnitude of the reaction current decreases
as well. In this case, the peak current is observed somewhat later
(Figure 3a). Rapid
corrosion on the surface of the Al film leads to the fact that the
reaction current decreases rapidly and reaches zero in less than a
minute after the start of the experiment. By this time, gas evolution
from the surface also ceases, as can be seen from the pressure measurements
(Figure 3b). In addition,
after the completion of the reaction, the Al film completely dissolves,
which is clearly visible to the naked eye due to the color change
of the active surface of the nanodiode sensor. The dissolution of
the Al film is also confirmed by ex situ XPS analysis (Figure 3c,d). SEM images of the surface
of the Al/Au/n-Si nanodiode sensor before and after the Al–water
reaction are shown in Figure S3.

High-resolution XPS spectra of the Al 2p and Au 4f peaks, measured
from the 10 nm Al/10 nm Au/n-Si nanodiode sensor before and after
the Al–water reaction in a 1000 mM NaOH solution.

The data shown in Figure 3a,b allow us to analyze the efficiency of
the reaction current
generated during the Al–water reaction. In particular, the
reaction current yield can be obtained, which is defined as the number
of charge carriers detected per H2 molecule 1  

The number of charge
carriers (Ne)
can be estimated by integrating the electrical signal from the sensor
over time (i.e., Ne = (1/e) · ∫0tIdt). In turn, the number of H2 molecules
(NH2) produced on the sensor
can be determined from the change in pressure in the reactor using
the ideal gas equation. The yield as a function of NaOH concentration,
calculated using eq 1, is shown in Figure 4. As can be seen, the yield is around 1% and remains almost unchanged
over the whole range of NaOH concentrations. This makes it convenient
to use sensors based on Schottky nanodiodes for kinetic studies of
the Al–water reaction and other similar reactions at the metal–liquid
interface. These findings may have potential applications in novel
operando sensing of chemical reactions and can also be useful in the
context of recent studies on the electronic control of chemical reactions.32,34

for the 10 nm Al/10 nm Au/n-Si nanodiode sensor.

The idea of creating a sensor based on a Schottky
nanodiode to
study charge transfer reactions at the liquid–solid interface
was discussed earlier.35,36 Nevertheless, the number of experimental
studies using such sensors is still quite small.29,37 As far as we know, the present paper is the first to report the
detection of electrical signals in metal–semiconductor nanodiode
sensors during the Al–water reaction. The nature of this phenomenon
is not yet clear. However, based on the reaction mechanism considered
elsewhere,4,13 one could assume the following sequence
of events: first, the surface oxide layer is destroyed via interaction
with the NaOH solution (reaction 2). Then, as follows from reaction 3, the Al surface interacts with hydroxide
ions to form aluminate. The electrons produced by this reaction are
consumed by the water reduction reaction (reaction 4). During the water reduction reaction, hydrogen
gas is released from the Al surface. 2   3   4  

As can be seen in these
equations, the Al–water reaction
takes place through an anodic (reaction 3) and a cathodic (reaction 4) reaction. Thus, we can consider the path
of electrons during the reaction as follows. The electrons produced
by the anodic reaction can be consumed by partial cathodic reactions,
such as the oxygen reduction reaction and/or water reduction reaction.13 However, considering the thinness of the Al/Au
metal film and the high mobility of electrons, it can also be expected
that a fraction of these electrons pass through the metal film and
reach the Schottky contact at the Au/Si interface (Figure 5a). As shown elsewhere,21 mobile electrons arising in metal films during
an exothermic reaction are carriers of excess energy, which is on
the order of 1 eV. Thus, it can be anticipated that electrons resulting
from the Al–water reaction are able to overcome the Schottky
barrier and enter the semiconductor. This process exceeds the thermionic
emission given by eq 5 (see Materials and Methods), and thus, it
can be considered as emission of hot electrons across the metal–semiconductor
interface. The resulting current may be responsible for the appearance
of the initial peak seen in Figure 2a,b. Arguing in a similar way, one can assume that
the reaction current (Figure 2a,c) is a consequence of charge transfer from the Schottky
barrier region to the near-surface region of the nanodiode sensor.
Indeed, the consumption of electrons during the cathodic reaction
leads to the depletion of the surface region of the metal film and
the formation of holes (Figure 5b). Given the exothermic nature of the Al–water reaction,
it can be expected that these holes are formed slightly below the
Fermi level in the metal. Examples of a similar process in gas–solid
reactions are well known.21,22,38−44 The current in this case is a consequence of the movement of holes
toward the Schottky contact and their neutralization there by electrons
from interfacial donor states.45

Figure 5 Proposed mechanism
for the generation of current in the Al/Au/n-Si
nanodiode sensor during the Al–water reaction. Here, the redistribution
of charge in the sensor is shown for the (a) anodic and (b) cathodic
reaction cases.

As shown elsewhere,46 a major fraction
of hot electrons created in metal films from the release of chemical
energy carry excess energy, which only slightly (E – EF≤0.4 eV) exceeds the
Fermi level. Such electrons are not able to overcome the Schottky
barrier, which for the case of the Al/Au/n-Si nanodiode sensors reaches
φb = 0.74 eV. This causes the small amplitude and
duration of the initial peak to be attributed to the anodic reaction.
At the same time, the proposed mechanism of charge transfer does not
require direct crossing of the Schottky contact by hot holes created
during the cathodic reaction. As shown in Figure 5b, in this case, the current flow is compensated
for by the transition of electrons through the Schottky barrier in
the forward direction, which greatly facilitates the charge transfer
process. This could explain the significantly larger magnitude and
duration of the reaction current than the initial peak.

3 Conclusions
We have considered the
possibility of using nanodiode sensors based
on a Schottky metal–semiconductor contact to study charge transfer
effects on the surface of ultrathin Al films in concentrated NaOH
solutions under reaction conditions. Electrons arising in the Al film
during the anodic reaction of aluminate formation and holes created
during the cathodic reduction of water lead to the transfer of excited
charge carriers through a Schottky contact in the nanodiode sensor.
These processes generate electrical current in the sensor that carries
information about surface chemical processes in real time. The current
yield of the nanodiode sensor is on the order of 1% and remains constant
over the whole range of NaOH concentrations, which makes it convenient
to use sensors of this type for operando studies of the Al–water
reaction.

4 Materials and Methods
The sensor was
fabricated by vacuum deposition of the metal contacts
onto an n-type Si (100) substrate (ρ = 1–10 Ω·cm).
Metal evaporation was carried out using several stainless-steel masks
with windows of different sizes and shapes that made it possible to
simultaneously produce 28 nanodiode sensors with identical properties
on a single Si substrate. First, to remove the native oxide, the Si
substrate was etched in a buffered oxide solution composed of NH4F and HF in water for 60 s at room temperature. The Si substrate
was then moved to the evaporator chamber for depositing the metal
contacts. The Au film (Schottky contact) was deposited onto the polished
surface of the Si substrate using electron-beam evaporation at a base
pressure of 2 × 10–6 torr and an average deposition
rate of 0.7 Å/s. The total area of the Schottky contact for a
single nanodiode sensor was A = 116 mm2. In the next stage, the nanodiode sensor was supplemented by an
ohmic contact. For this, a 50 nm thick Ti film followed by 50 nm of
Au was evaporated so that a 4 × 7 mm2 ohmic contact
was formed near each Schottky contact. In the final stage, a 10 nm
thick Al film with an area of 10 × 8 mm2 was deposited
directly onto the Au surface of the Au/n-Si nanodiode.

To obtain
the properties of the Schottky barrier at the metal–semiconductor
contact of the Al/Au/n-Si nanodiode sensor, current–voltage
(I–V) curves were measured
(see Figure S1). Based on the thermionic
emission theory of charge transport, the I–V curves for a forward-biased Schottky diode are given by 5  where A is
the area of the Schottky contact, A* is the Richardson
constant, T is the temperature, e is the elementary
charge, φb is the Schottky barrier height, kB is the Boltzmann constant, V is the voltage, Rser is the series resistance,
and η is the ideality factor. The Schottky barrier height obtained
by fitting eq 5 to the
experimental data is φb = 0.74 eV (at η = 1.03
and Rser = 55 Ω). This value is
somewhat lower than the typical Schottky barrier height φb = 0.8–0.83 eV reported in the literature for the contact
between Au and n-type Si.14,47 The low Schottky barrier
height is explained by the fact that eq 5 does not take into account tunneling effects through
defects and Au-induced gap states at the Au/n-Si interface or the
Schottky barrier lowering resulting from image charge.48

The apparatus for measuring the current
during the Al–water
reaction on the surface of the Al/Au/n-Si nanodiode sensor is explained
in detail elsewhere.33 The sample cell
containing the NaOH solution was connected to a manipulator that allowed
for immersion of the nanodiode sensor into the solution. The current
was measured using a model 2400 series SourceMeter from Keithley Instruments,
Inc. The rate of Al–water reaction was determined by measuring
the amount of H2 produced during the reaction where the
pressure change as a function of time was measured using a 120AA Baratron
high-accuracy absolute-capacitance manometer from MKS Instruments.
