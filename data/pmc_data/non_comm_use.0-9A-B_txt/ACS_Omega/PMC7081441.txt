Valproic acid (VP)
is a very effective therapy for the management
of generalized epilepsy. However, its use during pregnancy leads to
increased risk of teratogenesis and cognitive malfunctioning in postnatal
growing children. Antioxidants are used commercially as a palliative
therapy. This study compares the different antioxidants effects on
VP-induced teratogenicity. Pregnant female rats (n = 80) were divided into eight groups (n = 10) as
follows: Group I, control group; Group II, disease group valproic
acid (500 mg/kg); Groups III and IV, treated with 2000 and 8000 mg/kg
vitamin C, respectively; Groups V and VI, treated with selenium 100
and 200 μg/kg dose, respectively; and Groups VII and VIII, administered
grape seed extract 300 and 600 mg/kg, respectively. Groups III–VIII
received valproic acid (500 mg/kg) along with their respective treatments.
All treatments were given via an oral route. The fetuses were double
stained, and levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),
nitrite, glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were estimated.
Resorption rate was significantly reduced in Vit. C treated groups
at both dose levels. Maternal death rate was decreased remarkably
in all treatment groups. Vit. C at a high dose (8000 mg/kg) and grape
seed at a high dose (600 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence
of delayed cervical ossification. The values of MDA were significantly
reduced in all groups except the Vit. C group (2000 mg/kg). However,
no significant elevation was observed in the values of SOD, CAT, and
GSH. The current study concluded that vitamin C at a high dose (8000
mg/kg) and grape seed extract at a high dose (600 mg/kg) had partially
protected the fetuses exposed to VP.

1 Introduction
The term teratogenesis
originated from the Greek word meaning “monster”.
It is defined as a structural abnormality, functional or metabolic
malfunctioning present at the time of birth of an infant leading to
physical or mental disability or fatality.1 Drugs and chemicals can be labeled as teratogen on the basis of
its potential to induce teratogenic effects. Research revealed that
the teratogens are characterized according to their dose, route of
administration, and gestational stage of exposure.2 Valproic acid (VP) is a known teratogen. It is an effective
broad-spectrum anticonvulsant drug. It is also used in the treatment
of bipolar disorder and migraine. Valproic acid is very effective
in management of generalized epilepsy. However, its use during pregnancy
leads to an increased risk of teratogenesis and cognitive malfunctioning
in postnatal growing children.3 Exposure
to valproic acid in pregnancy specifically during early embryonic
stage corresponds with many fetal abnormalities including heart malfunctioning,
skeletal anomalies, neural tube defects, and limb deformities.4 Some mechanisms are proposed as an etiology of
VP-associated teratogenesis. In the current study, the focus was on
the redox control of embryo toxicity. The most commonly reported fetal
anomaly due to VP administration is neural tube defects. Previous
studies suggested that VP administration during pregnancy increased
the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These ROS damages the
DNA double-stranded structure. It is repaired by homologous recombination
(HR), which results in detrimental changes in the genetic makeup of
the DNA. The irregulation in gene expression that causes dysfunctioning
of the specified genes responsible for normal embryo development ultimately
ends up with the neural tube defects in the fetus.5 The imbalance between the production and elimination of
the ROS and nitrogenous species and loss of coordination between prevention
and repair mechanisms are called oxidative/nitrosative stress. Nitrosative
stress (NS) represented the generation of nitrogenous species that
plays an important role in the progression of the diseases state.6 Antioxidants are the endogenous enzymes, natural
substances, and drugs that counteract the harmful effects of oxidative/nitrosative
stress.7 The current study was conducted
to estimate the potential of selected antioxidants against the teratogenic
effect of valproic acid. The selected antioxidants were vitamin C,
selenium, and grape seed extract.

Vitamin C is a water-soluble
vitamin and is an essential nutrient
for humans. Vitamin C neutralizes the ROS production in oxidative
stress. Its antioxidant mechanisms involve a direct reaction with
aqueous peroxyl radicals or by indirectly restoring the fat-soluble
antioxidant vitamins. These properties of vitamin C are most probably
due to its chemical properties as a chelating and reducing agent.8 Another antioxidant selected in this study is
selenium, which is an oligo element; it has diverse health benefits
including its antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory action, and
reproduction and production of thyroid hormone. It is a trace element
and very potent agent. On the basis of its antioxidant properties,
it is used to reverse many pathological conditions associated with
oxidative stress. The protective effects of selenium against hepatotoxicity,
cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity are well-established.9 Few selenoproteins are termed as a selenoenzymes like glutathione
peroxidase and thio redox in reductase, representing the basic antioxidant
systems for the regulation of redox homeostasis at a cellular level.10

Grape seed is also a powerful antioxidant,
which protects the body
from development of pathological conditions secondary to oxidative
stress. The major flavonoids in grape seed extract powder (GSEP) that
contributes in its antioxidant property are proanthocyanidins. It
is evident from the research that the antioxidant capacity of proanthocyanidins
is 20 times higher than vitamin E and 50 times higher than vitamin
C.11 The phytochemical components in grape
seed powder extract are different in various kinds. GSEP contain anthocyanins,
phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, and stilbenes, all of these are
strong antioxidants.12 It contains 11%
protein, 35% fiber, 3% minerals, and 7% water. The range of the lipid
content of GSEP is 7–20%.13 Many
pharmacological activities of grape seed extract have been identified.
It was found to be beneficial for diabetic patients by decreasing
the paraoxonase activity in experimental rats.14 Multiple studies suggested that proanthocyanidins in GSEP
successfully suppressed the inflammatory events.15 Regular consumption of GREP decreases the degenerative
changes in the body.16 The antimicrobial
activity of GSEP was determined against 43 strains of MRSA at 3 mg/mL
GSEP equal to 20.7 μg/mL proanthocyanidin content. All bacterial
strains were completely inhibited by GSEP.17 Due to the antioxidant property of GSEP, it is extensively used
at both high- and low-dose levels in pregnant specimens to evaluate
its protective effect against specified teratogens.18

2 Results and Discussion
Teratogenesis
is a global problem especially with the emerging
era of new drug development and investigation. The teratogenic study
is considered as one of the fundamental part of toxicological evaluation
of any drug, and it is important to reduce the births of malformed
infants.19 The obscurity in getting data
regarding the effect of drug on a developing fetus is due to limitations
in inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials.20 It has been reported that anticonvulsant drugs cause major
fetal malformations called “anticonvulsant embryopathy”.21 Childbearing women are at major risk of embryopathy
associated with anticonvulsants. Numerous studies suggested that valproic
acid-induced fetal malformations are due to the formation of reactive
oxygen species because, during the initial developmental stage, the
embryonic antioxidant system is immature, and the embryo is more prone
to damage by oxidative stress, which results in extensive fetal structural
abnormalities.4 It has been established
that supplementation with antioxidants reversed or reduced the incidence
of valproic acid-induced embryo toxicity.22 The previous studies were further expanded in the present study,
and specified antioxidants were administered to inhibit the VP-associated
teratogenesis.

Table 1 shows that
the values of malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly reduced in
all groups in comparison to the disease group except the low-dose
vitamin C group (2000 mg/kg). This indicated that oxidative stress
was reduced by the administration of specified antioxidants in combination
with VP. However, activities of SOD, CAT, nitrite, and GSH were not
significantly altered by the given antioxidants. The mechanism of
teratogenicity of valproic acid was investigated by the estimation
of levels of endogenous antioxidants. Malondialdehyde is used as an
expedient biomarker for lipid peroxidation of fatty acids such as
omega-3 and omega-6. This wide use of MDA is due to its simpler chemical
reaction with thiobarbituric acid. It is the most convenient and reliable
marker for the determination of oxidative stress in a variety of in
vivo studies.23 In the present study, MDA
values were significantly reduced, suggesting that malondialdehyde
exerts a protective mechanism against VP-induced fetal toxicity (Table 1). Treatment agents
along with valproic acid reduce somehow the levels of nitrite levels,
so they inhibited the less nitrogen generating species (NOS) produced
due to the imbalance between oxidative and nitrosative stress.

Skeletal anomalies
were observed after double staining of fetal
skeletons.24 In rodents, mostly spina bifida
occulta is evident with valproic acid administration as compared to
open neural tube defects such as spina bifida aperta.25 In the current study, our results indicated that spina
bifida occulta was reduced by all specified antioxidants. Several
specimens were presented with the normal vertebral arch (Table 2). The space between
the cartilaginous ends of the vertebral arch of the fetus was measured,
and spacing was reduced in all treatment groups except selenium at
a low dose (10 μg/kg). Other skeletal anomalies such as rib
malformations, cleft palate, and delayed cervical ossifications are
also associated with VP-induced fetal toxicity.24 The vitamin C (8000 mg/kg) and grape seed (600 mg/kg) treatment
group showed a protective effect against delayed cervical ossifications
when compared to non-ossified cervical regions of the disease control
group. Complete cervical ossification was observed in specimens received
vitamin C (8000 mg/kg) and grape seed extract powder (600 mg/kg),
which reflects upon the successful protective effect exerted by the
specified antioxidants. The specimens were carefully examined under
a dissecting microscope for cleft palate, spina bifida occulta, rib
malformations, and cervical ossification (Figures 1–5). Vitamin C at a high
dose (8000 mg/kg) and grape seed at a high dose (600 mg/kg) significantly
reduced the incidence of delayed cervical ossification (Table 2), whereas rib malformation
was significantly (P < 0.05) minimized by selenium
at a high dose (200 μg/kg) and grape seed at a high dose (600
mg/kg) (Table 2). Moreover,
co-administration of valproic acid with vitamin C (2000 + 8000 mg/kg),
selenium (200 μg/kg), and grape seed (300 + 600 mg/kg) significantly
(P < 0.05) reduced the distance between the cartilaginous
ends of the vertebral arch, which is evident in the reduction of incidence
of spina occulta in the stained specimens (Table 2).

The dams were sacrificed on the 20th day of gestation
and evaluated
for maternal and developmental parameters. The valproic acid teratogenicity
model was expressed with severe fetal toxicity. Spontaneous abortions
were reported as a common event in women receiving antiepileptics.26 Vitamin C (200 + 8000 mg/kg) and selenium (10
μg/kg) reduced the rate of early and late resorptions. Dams
were also observed for a number of abortions, which were reduced by
selenium and grape seed extract powder. According to Wilson’s
stages of rat embryo development, the most susceptible period for
the onset of teratogenicity is organogenesis (Table 3).27

Delayed conception was also observed
in many specimens. Figure 6 shows the fatty
uterus of a dam presented with late conception. It has been reported
that obesity has injurious effects on the reproductive system. One
of the common reasons of infertility is the prevalence of obesity
in both men and women.28 A study compared
the changes in maternal weight with the weight of dams on day 1 of
valproic acid administration and antioxidants. Significant alleviation
in maternal weight was observed in vitamin C (8000 mg/kg) and grape
seed (600 mg/kg) treated groups (Table 4).

Maternal and fetal lethality was
reduced in all treatment groups
(Table 5 and Figure 7). However, grape
seed at a dose level of 300 + 600 mg/kg, vitamin C (200 mg/kg), and
selenium (100 μg/kg) had not shown potential to reduce the fetal
lethality induced by valproic acid. Fetuses were observed for gross
malformations, and the crown rump length was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in grape seed (600 mg/kg). Moreover,
at a high dose (600 mg/kg), grape seed has shown good potential (P < 0.01) to reduce the incidence of fetal growth retardation
in comparison to other groups treated with antioxidants (Table 6). Treatment groups
other than grape seed 600 (mg/kg) had not shown any significant effect
on the crown rump length of fetuses. Fatty uterus of dams treated
with grape seed extract was observed as shown in Figure 1. Accumulation of fat in the
region of the uterus indicates the etiology behind the delayed conception
of some dams.

The current results
demonstrated in general that the protective
effect of vitamin C, selenium, and grape seed extract powder is incomplete,
and more factors may be contributed. Moreover, the dosage levels of
valproic acid and antioxidants are highly crucial as increased level
or decreased levels of dose can result in damaging effects on the
embryo. In this study, different antioxidants were compared to specify
the most effective antioxidant to control the toxic effects of valproic
acid on developing fetus.

3 Conclusions
Valproic
acid possesses high potential of inducing teratogenesis;
therefore, its embryo toxic effects were not fully reversed. In the
present study, the protective effect of specified antioxidants were
compared, and it is concluded that vitamin C at a high dose (8000
mg/kg b.w.) and grape seed extract at a high dose (600 mg/kg b.w.)
had partially protected the fetuses exposed to valproic acid. It is
suggested that a high dose of vitamin C and GSEP may protect the developing
fetuses from the toxic effects of valproic acid. Moreover, the results
of the current study support the proposed hypothesis that the teratogenic
effect of valproic acid may be associated with the formation of reactive
oxygen species and the specified antioxidants co-administered with
valproic acid partially decrease the fetal growth retardation, incidence
of spina bifida occulta, abortions, and fetal and maternal mortality
rate.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Drugs
and Chemicals
Vitamin C, selenium,
and grape seed extract were purchased from General Nutrition Corporation
(USA). Valproic acid was purchased from Abbott laboratories. Elman’s
reagent, pyrogallol solution, and alcian blue were purchased from
Oxford Lab Chemicals India. Alizarin red S was purchased from Omicron
Sciences Limited UK. EDTA, carboxymethylcellulose, and Folin’s
reagent were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA.

4.2 Experimental Animals
Female albino
rats were purchased from the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences.
All female rats were nulliparous with an average weight ranging from
130 to 160 g before conception. All experimental female rats were
caged in the animal house of Riphah International University under
12 h light/dark cycles at 22 ± 2 °C temperature and 45–55%
humidity with food and unlimited supply of water. All methods were
approved by the research ethical committee of Riphah International
University, Lahore, with an authorized number of REC/RIPS-LHR/013
ruled under the regulation of Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources,
Commission on Life Sciences University, National Research Council
(1996).

4.3 Experimental Protocol
The experiment
was designed according to the OECD guidelines 414.29 Female rats were subjected to mating with healthy male
rats. Three female rats were caged with one male rat until the vaginal
plug was seen. The day when the vaginal plug was seen is labeled as
0 day of gestation.30 Pregnant female rats
(n = 80) were divided into eight groups, each group
contained 10 pregnant female rats. Group I: received CMC (0.5%) with
no active drug treatment and served as a control group (N.C). Group
II: disease group (D.G) with induced teratogenesis, 500 mg/kg valproic
acid (V.P). Group III: treated with 2000 mg/kg vitamin C (Vit. C).
Group IV: treated with 8000 mg/kg vitamin C. Group V: treated with
selenium (Se, 100 μg/kg). Group VI: treated with selenium (200
μg/kg). Group VII: administered grape seed extract (300 mg/kg).
Group VIII: administered grape seed extract (600 mg/kg). All the treatments
were given via an oral route. Groups III–VIII received valproic
acid prior to their respective treatment. All groups treated with
their respective treatments from day 5 to day 15 of gestational period.
C-section was done at the 19th day of pregnancy. The volume of each
treatment administered orally was within the limits of the said guidelines.
The doses for rats were calculated using the maximum human tolerable
given in the literature.31

4.4 Gross Observations
Fetuses were carefully
taken out after C-section of pregnant female rats; placenta was removed
and kept separately. The crown rump length of each fetus was measured,
each fetus was weighed, and numbers of live fetuses were counted.
Fetuses were carefully observed for any deformity, for example, hematoma
on the back bone or skull, limb deformity, and growth retardation.
The weight of the placenta of each fetus was carefully measured.

4.5 Double Staining of Fetal Skeleton
Skeletons
of fetuses of all groups were double stained with alcian
blue and alizarin red.32 Rat fetuses were
obtained after performing the C-section of female pregnant rats. These
fetuses were kept in 4% normal saline for one night at 4 °C to
macerate the skin. The fetal skin was removed carefully. All organs
and muscles were carefully removed. The skinned fetuses were then
kept in an acidic solution (pH 2.8) for about 24 h, and after that
moisture from specimens was removed by keeping them in absolute ethanol
for 6 h. When the specimens were dehydrated in ethanol, they were
placed in a basic solution for at least 24–30 h, and the solution
was changed during 30 h at least two times. The basic solution is
for removing the adipose tissues from the specimens. KOH in the basic
solution caused the bond annihilation in tissues.33 The stained specimens were cleared by placing them in a
clearing solution for at least 6–8 h. The specimens were preserved
in 1:1 70 % ethanol/ glycerin.

The stained specimens were studied
under the dissecting microscope for the observation of cleft palate,
bone ossification, spina bifida occulta, rib deformities, and limb
formation. The distance between the cartilaginous ends of the vertebral
arch of the lumbar and thoracic region was measured for the observation
of spina bifida occulta. An ocular micrometer was fixed into the eyepiece
of a dissecting microscope, and the distance between the vertebral
arches in micrometer was measured. The value in micrometer was converted
into the actual distance by multiplying it with the magnification
(2×).34

Moreover, the interpretation
of other skeletal deformities such
as rib malformations, cervical ossification, and cleft palate was
numbered as 1 if the specified malformation is present and 0 in the
case of the absence of that specified malformation.

4.6 Biochemical Markers
4.6.1 Preparation of Tissue
Homogenate
The pregnant female rats were anesthetized with
chloroform.35 C-section was done to get
the fetuses. Tissue
homogenates of fetuses were prepared by a ratio of 1:10 in ice-cold
phosphate buffer by using a tissue homogenizer (1 part of tissue and
10 parts of phosphate buffer). The homogenate was then centrifuged
at 6000 rpm ± 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was taken
for performance of tests for analysis of biochemical markers.

4.6.2 Estimation of Superoxide Dismutase
In 0.1 mL of tissue
homogenate, 0.1 mL of pyrogallol and 2.8 mL of
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were added. Absorbance on a spectrophotometer
was measured at a wavelength of 325 nm.36 The following formula was used to calculate the value of SOD:  

4.6.3 Catalase
Catalase
activity was
determined by the method in ref (36). A 0.05 mL solution of the fetal tissue homogenate
was taken. To a 1.95 mL solution of phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7),
1 mL of 30 mM hydrogen peroxide solution was added. This reaction
mixture was analyzed on a spectrophotometer for the measurement of
absorbance. Absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 240
nm. The following formula was used for the calculation of catalase
value:  where O.D is the change in absorbance/minute,
and E is the extinction coefficient of hydrogen peroxide
having a value of 0.071 mmol cm–1. Protein content
was calculated by Lowry’s method.37

4.6.4 Estimation of Glutathione
One milliliter
of the tissue homogenate was taken, and it was precipitated with 1
mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Four milliliters of phosphate buffer
solution and 0.5 mL of DTNB reagent were added to an aliquot of the
supernatant.38 Absorbance was measured
at 412 nm. The following formula was used for estimation of GSH:  where DF is the dilution factor, which is
1, VU is the volume of the aliquot, Y is the absorbance
at 412 nm, and BT is the tissue homogenate.

4.6.5 Estimation
of Malondialdehyde
MDA
level was calculated by the method in ref (38). One milliliter of the supernatant was taken,
and it was added to 3 mL of TBA reagent. The mixture was shaken and
left for 15 min. After that, the test tube containing the mixture
was cooled down in an ice bath and then centrifuged. The upper layer
was taken for measurement of absorbance. Absorbance of the reaction
mixture was measured at 532 nm. The following formula was used for
the calculation of the MDA value:  where VT is the
total volume of the mixture, which is 4 mL, WT is the weight of the dissected brain, and VU is the aliquot volume.

4.6.6 Estimation
of Nitrite Levels
The
Griess reagent method was used for the estimation of nitrite. The
supernatant of the tissue homogenate (1 mL) and Griess reagent (1
mL) were mixed thoroughly and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.
Absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 546 nm. For the
estimation of nitrite levels, a regression line of sodium nitrite
was used.39

4.7 Statistical
Analysis
Data are represented
as mean ± SEM. One-way and two-way ANOVA was used. Dunnett and
Bonferroni post-test were used, respectively. P <
0.05 was considered significant, P < 0.01 was
moderately significant, and P < 0.001 was considered
highly significant in comparison to the disease group.
