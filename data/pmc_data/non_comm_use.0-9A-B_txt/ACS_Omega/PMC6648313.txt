A liquescent
salt based on an N-pentylphenothiazine
radical cation (1•+·NTf2–) exhibited a unique crystal–crystal phase transition
from a paramagnetic orange solid to a diamagnetic green solid induced
by brief, weak, and pinpoint mechanostress. Electron spin resonance
and electronic spectroscopies revealed that this unprecedented solid-state
spin controllability was attributable to mechanostress-triggered sequential
association of the highly mobile radical species occurring under neat
conditions.

Introduction
Recent advancements
in organic radicals have enabled their utilization
as promising components for molecule-based magnetic and electronic
materials.1−4 The association characteristics of these molecules have a significant
influence on their electronic, electric, and magnetic properties.1−4 In solution state, some of the charged radicals with a π-conjugated
system have displayed dynamic changes in spin properties that were
attributed to their association/dissociation.5,6 These
fascinating species could potentially be used as molecule-based materials
with simultaneous modulation of spin-related properties if their association
structures could be dynamically changed through external stimuli.
Controls of radical spin properties in the solid state have previously
been achieved under harsh conditions, such as high temperatures,7 high pressures,8 and
grinding.9 All of these conditions require
energy-consuming processes to ensure stoichiometric conversion of
the entire system. Therefore, an urgent topic in the development of
future functional radical materials is the creation of molecules with
spin properties that can be significantly controlled upon brief and
weak external stimuli based on domino-type sequential changes10 in molecular arrangements. However, such a sophisticated
spin control and the necessary rational molecular designs have long
remained undiscovered, likely due to difficulties in achieving π-conjugated
radicals with sufficient molecular mobility,11 as they definitively require molecular rigidity in their structures.
This dilemma has inspired the development of new methodologies employing
molecular fluidity in the radical associates under neat conditions.

We designed a phenothiazine radical cation bearing a bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
anion, 1•+·NTf2–, in which
(1) the stable open-shell system on the π-conjugated platform
provides variable electronic structures depending on its association12 and (2) flexibility and charge delocalization
of the anion increase the phase transition controllability within
a narrow range of ambient temperatures upon enhancement of the molecular
fluidity.13,14 Consequently, we found that the spin and
color properties of the liquescent radical cation salt 1•+·NTf2–, which bears high
molecular mobility in the condensed state, were controllable via the
introduction of indirect, instantaneous, weak, and pinpoint mechanostress
as a stimuli-triggered initiation of domino rearrangement of its molecular
alignment.

Results and Discussion
Radical cation salt 1•+·NTf2– displayed unique color
changes in conjunction with phase transitions
induced by thermal and mechanical stimuli (Figures 1 and S1). A deep
green crystal (GC) of 1•+·NTf2–, which was obtained by recrystallization from dichloromethane/cyclohexane,
transformed to an orange liquid (OL) state upon heating
to 100 °C.15 Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) of the compound revealed no weight loss until 150 °C under
aerated conditions (Figure S2), demonstrating
that the phase transition occurred without any decomposition. Upon
lowering the temperature to 50 °C, the OL changed
to an orange solid (OS) in a kinetically locked state,
which became a thermodynamically stable green solid (GS) state very slowly upon standing at 30 °C (Figures 1b and S1 and Movie S1). Notably, the
kinetic OS state transformed to the thermodynamic GS state upon brief, weak, and pinpoint mechanostress, whereas
the OS state remained unchanged without mechanostress
at 50 °C (Figures 1c and S1 and Movies S2 and S3). Such a dynamic thermo-
and mechanochromism has never been observed in analogues such as 1•+·BF4– [mp. 165 °C
(decomp)], 1•+·PF6– [mp. 159
°C (decomp)], and 1•+·SbF6– [mp. 161 °C (decomp)] under the similar conditions, suggesting
that the flexibility of the NTf2– anion
assists in lowering the melting point less than the decomposed point
(see Figure S3). Figure 1c and Movie S2 clearly demonstrate that the green spot caused by pinpoint stress
on the OS spread to all areas spontaneously after standing at 50 °C.

The magnetic properties of 1•+·NTf2– changed drastically
with its phase transitions. Figures 2a and S4 illustrate the
changes in the electron spin resonance (ESR)
spectra that occurred during the transitions between the GC, OL, OS, and GS states. Although
the GC state was almost ESR silent, the signal intensity
increased significantly during the transition to the OL state upon heating. The kinetic OS state remained ESR
active, whereas the thermodynamic GS state prepared by
cooling was entirely ESR silent. The hysteretic changes in the ESR
intensities were observed repeatedly (Figure S5). These spectral changes demonstrated that (1) the radical cation 1•+ in the GC and GS states formed dimer species with strong antiferromagnetic
interactions, thereby exhibiting diamagnetic (DM) properties,
and (2) the radical cations in the OL and OS states interacted weakly and thus showed paramagnetic (PM) properties. The strong antiferromagnetic interaction in the DM-GC state was also clarified by the temperature-dependent
χp value in terms of a superconducting quantum interference
device, which was estimated with the singlet–triplet model
as 2J/kB = −2.6
× 103 K (Figure S6). Most
importantly, the paramagnetic property of the kinetic solid (PM-OS) could be drastically changed to a diamagnetic solid
(DM-GS) by pinpoint mechanostress (Figure 2b). This is the first demonstration of dynamic
spin control of the radical solids by instantaneous, weak, and pinpoint
addition of mechanostress.

states
upon (a,c) thermal and (b) mechanical stimuli. Transformations (a,c)
between DM-GC, PM-OL, PM-OS, and DM-GS states (top to bottom) upon temperature
changes at 30, 100, 30, and 30 °C, respectively, and (b) PM-OS to DM-GS states (Figure 1c and Movie S3) upon pinpoint mechanostress at 50 °C.

To gain further insights into the mechanism of stimuli-induced
spin-state control, we examined the electronic structures of 1•+·NTf2– in various states.
The changes in electronic spectra of various 1•+·NTf2– aggregates are shown in Figures 2c (400–900
nm) and S7 (300–1500 nm). The spectra of the DM-GC state exhibited characteristic absorption bands at approximately
480 and 790 nm, which suggested the formation of associated phenothiazine
radical cations.12b The PM-OL state displayed a distinct absorption pattern with a strong band
at approximately 513 nm and a weak band in the near-IR region. These
bands were attributed to the monomer of the phenothiazine radical
cation based on its spectrum in dichloromethane (Figure S7). The absorption bands of the PM-OS state were similar to those of the PM-OL state, although
the PM-OS state exhibited a significantly greater intensity
in the near-IR band, which suggested that the electronic structure
of the PM-OS state was intermediary between the DM-GC and PM-OL states. The spectrum of the DM-GS state was identical to that of the DM-GC state. These spectra indicated that the present phase transitions
originated from the association and dissociation of the dimer structure
of the phenothiazine radical cation.

The dissociation and association
of the radical dimer during the
phase transitions, accompanied by drastic changes in spin and color
properties, were established by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
The single-crystal XRD pattern of the DM-GC state revealed
that crystallographically independent units 1 and 2 formed a π-dimer,
where the planar phenothiazine unit experienced face-to-face contact
in an eclipsed and head-to-head manner (Figures 3a and S8). The
intermolecular distance of the S–S contact in the π-dimer
was estimated to be 2.98 Å, which is significantly shorter than
the sum of the van der Waals radii.16,17 The crystal
packing structure revealed that no significant dimer–dimer
interactions were present in any of the axis projections (Figures 3a and S9). Powder XRD measurements (Figures 3b, S10, and S11) revealed that the sharp diffraction peaks in the DM-GC state nearly disappeared in the PM-OL state,
changed to a distinctly sharp pattern in the PM-OS state,
and finally returned back to the original crystal pattern in the DM-GS state.

Figure 3 (a) Packing of π-dimer structure along the a (top) and c (bottom) axes. (b) Powder
XRD patterns
of the DM-GC, PM-OL, PM-OS,
and DM-GS (top to bottom) states, measured at 30, 120,
30, and 30 °C, respectively.

A schematic diagram of the stimuli-induced spin control of 1•+·NTf2– is shown in Figure S12. The diamagnetic property of the GC state was rationalized as reflecting a co-facial association
in a π-dimer (Figure S12a), where
the π-orbitals of each radical unit effectively overlapped at
their positive spin densities (Figure S8). This state switched to the paramagnetic OL state
upon the cleavage of the inter-radical interactions in the π-dimer
(Figure S12b), which readily arises thermally
within the range of ambient temperatures owing to the high fluxional
behavior of the ion pair. The liberated ion pair in the PM-OL state underwent acute rearrangement of species upon cooling to 50
°C (Figure S12c), at which point the
ion pair lost its fluidity by offsetting the π-stacking interactions
with least molecular motions to afford metastable, kinetic crystals
that still exhibited paramagnetic properties. The proposed offset
stacking in the paramagnetic kinetic crystal OS seems
to be evidenced by an N-octyl analogue crystal bearing
an offset stacking arrangement (Figure S13) with paramagnetic properties (Figure S14) and UV/vis/near-IR patterns close to that of the PM-OS of 1•+·NTf2– (Figure 2c). Introduction
of weak, brief mechanostress to a pinpoint region of the kinetically
formed, offset stacking alignment of the PM-OS state
gave rise to a regional phase transition to a thermodynamically stable,
π-dimer structure (Figure S12d).18 The subsequent π-dimer domain region underwent
anisotropic growth via the consecutive domino-type molecular movement
to convert the PM-OS state to the DM-GC state
spontaneously across the entirety of the crystal region. Additional
results including an unprecedented single-crystal-to-single-crystal
transformation also suggested changes in the structure spin and color
properties (Tables S1 and S2 and Figures S15 and 16).

Conclusions
We
have prepared a liquescent radical ion salt, 1•+·NTf2–, that displayed drastic spin-state
changes induced by heating and cooling processes or a brief, weak,
and pinpoint mechanostress accompanied by domino transfer of molecular
alignment. The ESR/electronic spectra and XRD patterns indicated that
the unprecedented changes are very likely attributable to dynamic
changes in the association structures of 1•+ during the crystal–liquid and the crystal–crystal
transformations. The observed phenomena indicate that flexible ion
pairs with charged radical ions that are capable of associations are
one of a rational strategy for molecule-based materials with extreme
sensitivity to external stimuli.

on a Yanagimoto melting point apparatus. UV/vis/near-IR absorption
spectra in solution state and KBr pellets were obtained on a JASCO
V-650 spectrophotometer and a Shimadzu UV/vis/near-IR scanning spectrometer
UV-3100 PC, respectively. UV/vis/near-IR spectra of neat samples were
recorded using an Ocean Optics HR4000 spectrometer. Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) was performed with a SHIMADZU DSC-60. TGA and differential
thermal analysis were measured using a SHIMADZU DTG-60. ESR spectra
