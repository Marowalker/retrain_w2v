We
report here the synthesis and structural characterization of
a new class of homoleptic terpyridine complexes of Ru(II) containing
styrylbenzene moieties to improve room-temperature luminescence properties.
Solid-state structure determination of 2 was done through
single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Tuning of photophysical properties
was done by incorporating both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
substituents in the ligand. The complexes exhibit strong emission
having lifetimes in the range of 10.0–158.5 ns, dependent on
the substituent and the solvent. Good correlations were also observed
between Hammett σp parameters with the lifetimes
of the complexes. Styrylbenzene moieties in the complexes induce trans–trans
to trans–cis isomerization accompanied by huge alteration of
their spectral profiles upon treating with UV light. Reversal of trans–cis
to trans–trans forms was also achieved on interacting with
visible light. Change from trans–trans to the corresponding
trans–cis form leads to emission quenching, whereas trans–cis
to the corresponding trans–trans form leads to restoration
of emission. In essence, “on–off” and “off–on”
photoswitching of luminescence was observed. Calculations involving
density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent-DFT methods were
performed to understand the electronic structures as well as for appropriate
assignment of the absorption and emission bands.

Introduction
Compounds with photoswitchable
optical and luminescence properties
are very promising with regard to their important roles in various
applications such as optical materials, photoswitches, and memory
devices.1−7 Significant efforts have been made to strengthen this area, and
as an outcome, a sizable number of photochromic systems based on azobenzenes,
stilbenes, diarylethenes, spiropyrans, and spirooxazines have been
developed.8−13 Despite numerous reports on photoisomerizable organic compounds
where the photochromic activity originated from their singlet excited
state, only a limited number of studies have been performed on their
inorganic counterparts (coordination complexes).14−24 Transition-metal based materials are especially attractive in that
they have additional advantage over their organic counterparts in
offering tunability in the electronic nature of both inorganic and
organic components.25−29 In addition, incorporation of photoisomerizable ligands (such as
stilbene and azobenzene) onto the complex systems with various transition
metals induces the access of the ligand-centered triplet state leading
to the generation of long-lived excited states. Moreover, the excitation
and emission wavelengths could be extended to a long wavelength region.2,14,30−37

Among numerous transition metals, Ru(II)–polypyridine
complexes
are regarded as potential building blocks for photomolecular devices
because of their remarkable photoredox behaviors and long-lived metal-to-ligand
charge-transfer (MLCT) excited states.38−41 Polypyridine ligands based on
bipyridine units (such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+) are
better over terpyridine (such as [Ru(tpy)2]2+) with regard to their emission behaviors, while terpyridine units
are better in terms of construction of linear and achiral octahedral
architectures.42−47 [Ru(bpy)3]2+ exhibits intense and long-lived
(τ ≈ 1 μs) luminescence,38 whereas [Ru(tpy)2]2+ is almost nonemissive
with excited-state lifetime (τ ≈ 0.25 ns) at room temperature
(RT).48 The lack of emission is due to
the close proximity of 3MLCT and 3MC state induced
by their distorted octahedral geometries.42−47 For proper utilization of the structurally appealing terpyridine
complexes of Ru(II) as effective visible light photosensitizers, their
luminescence behaviors have to be optimized. Improvement of emission
characteristics can usually be achieved by synthetic strategies, viz.
upon incorporation of electron-donating or electron-accepting substituents48−51 and polyaromatic chromophores52−54 to adjust the relative position
of 3MLCT and 3MC states. Cyclometalated ligands
can often destabilize the 3MC state.55−58 Replacement of pyridine ring
by different heterocyclic moieties may sometime give rise to less
distorted octahedral configuration.59−63 The important point for improving their emission
behaviors is to extend the electron delocalization for minimizing
nonradiative deactivation channels.64−71

As a part of continuous efforts for the design and improving
the
luminescence properties of Ru(II)–terpyridine complexes,72−81 we report in this work synthesis, characterization, photophysics,
redox behaviors, and trans–cis photoisomerization process of
a new class of homoleptic complexes of the type [Ru(tpy-pvp-X)2](ClO4)2 by introducing styrylbenzene
units onto the terpyridine moiety (Chart 1). The electronic nature of X in tpy-pvp-X
was varied to tune the properties as well as the kinetics of the isomerization
process. Photoisomerization studies of some Ru(II) complexes incorporating
azo functionality onto the terpyridine moiety are reported.14,15,82−88 However, to our notice, no such studies were carried out by incorporating
styrylbenzene unit into the terpyridine motif. Prior to this work,
we recently reported a heteroleptic series of the type [(tpy-PhCH3)Ru(tpy-pvp-X)](BF4)2 with the same
styrylbenzene–terpyridine ligands.89 Incorporation of two styrylbenzene units around the central Ru(II)
center could extend the path of electron delocalization substantially.
It is expected that lengthening of conjugation will enhance the lifetime
of the present series with respect to the previous one. In addition,
presence of two photoisomerizable styrylbenzene units in the present
series of complexes could also facilitate the occurrence of photoinduced
trans–trans to trans–cis isomerization processes. In
practice, the lifetime of the complexes in this study enhanced substantially
with respect to the previous one. Finally, insights into the electronic
structures of the trans–trans, trans–cis, and cis–cis
forms of complexes and appropriate assignment of their optical spectral
bands were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent
TD-DFT calculations.

Complexes
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
Homoleptic bis-terpyridine
Ru(II) complexes were synthesized in a straightforward manner by the
reaction between RuCl3·3H2O and the respective
terpyridine ligand (tpy-pvp-X) in 1:2 proportion in refluxing (CH2OH)2 under argon protection. Column chromatography
and recrystallization techniques were employed to purify the complexes.
Characterization of the complexes was conducted using standard analytical
and spectroscopic tools, and the data are given in the Experimental Section. Single-crystal X-ray structure of 2 was also determined.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Spectra
Figure 1 displays the 1H
NMR spectra of 1–5. Tentative assignment of proton
resonances is also given in Figure 1. The {1H–1H} COSY nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (Figures S1–S5, Supporting Information) along with the spectral
data of structurally related complexes guide us for the assignment
of proton resonances in the complexes.75−80 The relatively simple 1H NMR spectra reflect a symmetrical
environment around the Ru(II) center of the complexes. The singlet
that appears at the most downfield region (∼9.5 ppm) is assigned
as H3′. A pair of doublet within 7.32–7.72 ppm is assignable
to the protons of ethylenic double bond (H9 and H10) and corresponds
to the trans–trans conformation. In some cases, they appeared
within the multiplet because of the coincidence of other protons.
The singlet at 2.5 ppm for 2, which is not shown in Figure 1, corresponds to
the −CH3 groups.

assignment of peaks of 1–5 in DMSO-d6.

Mass Spectra
Electrospray
mass spectra along with the
isotopic distributions for 1–5 are presented (Figures
S6–S10, Supporting Information).
In all cases, an abundant peak is observed between m/z = 462.03 for 1 and 538.29 for 5 with a good correlation between experimental and simulated
patterns. The successive isotopic lines in the mass spectra are separated
by 0.5 Da, which clearly show the existence of [Ru(tpy-pvp-X)2]2+ type of species in all cases. The complexes
also exhibit a monopositive ion, [Ru(tpy-pvp-X)2(ClO4)]+, in some cases, but the abundance of these
species is extremely small compared with +2 charged species (Figures
S11–S13, Supporting Information).

Crystal Structure of 2
Single crystals
were acquired by layering toluene to the MeCN–dichloromethane
(DCM) (1:1 v/v) solution of 2. Relevant data related
to crystal structure determination are tabulated in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Selected bond distances
and angles are summarized in Table S2 (Supporting Information). A perspective view of 2 is presented
in Figure 2. The geometry
of 2 around the metal center is distorted octahedrally.
Trans–trans orientation of two aryl units across the double
bond at both sides of the Ru(II) center is also evident from the structure.
The Ru–N bond lengths varying between 1.971(2) and 2.080(2)
Å are comparable to those of the reported structurally related
compounds.79−81

Computational Studies
Geometries of trans–trans,
trans–cis, and cis–cis forms were optimized with the
DFT method using Gaussian 09 software in acetonitrile. Optimized structural
details are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S14 and Tables S2–S6). Distorted octahedral geometry
of the complexes with two tpy units oriented meridionally around the
metal center is evident from the structural parameters. In the case
of 2, experimental structural parameters agree with the
calculated values.

The molecular orbitals (MOs) and their energies
are given in the Supporting Information (Figures S15–S19 and Tables S7–S11). With few exceptions,
highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) in all the three forms
are mainly localized on the Ru(II) center and styrylbenzene group,
whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are localized
on the terpyridine units. By contrast, lowest-energy LUMO in 4 is located on the nitrobenzene part because of its electron-withdrawing
nature, whereas higher-energy LUMOs are localized as usual on both
terpyridine and nitrobenzene moieties of the ligand. In general, the
compositions of HOMOs and LUMOs in three geometrical forms of the
complexes are similar, and only a small variation is observed in some
cases. The electrostatic potential energy plots of 1–5 showing spreading of electron density are presented in Figure S20
(Supporting Information). Green color stands
for the electron-rich portion, whereas blue color stands for the electron-deficient
portion. Distribution of electronic charge density does not differ
significantly among the three forms as expected.

Calculated
UV–vis spectra of trans–trans, trans–cis,
and cis–cis forms of complexes were obtained by carrying out
the TD-DFT calculation in an acetonitrile medium utilizing the conductor-like
polarizable continuum model. The spectral data of singlet–singlet
transitions in the three forms of 1–5 and their
band assignment were given in the Supporting Information (Tables S12–S16). The set of MOs participated in the longest-wavelength
band are displayed in Figures 3 and S21–S24 (Supporting Information). Lowest-energy band located between 487 nm (3 and 4) and 501 nm (5) in their trans–trans
forms, between 482 nm (3 & 4) and 496
nm (5) in their trans–cis forms, and between 474
nm (3) and 482 nm (5) in their cis–cis
forms arises because of combined Ru(II)-to-terpyridine MLCT and styrylbenzene-to-terpyridine
intraligand charge-transfer (ILCT) (Figures S21–S24, Supporting Information). In the case of 4, the band at 487 nm is due to combined charge transfer from
ruthenium(II) and styrylbenzene unit to nitrobenzene moiety (Figure 3). Thus, the lowest-energy
band has both MLCT and ILCT characters. The band that is located between
303 and 373 nm considering all the three forms is mainly because of
the charge transfer from styrylbenzene to terpyridine moiety. The
high-intensity UV bands mainly comprise π–π* transitions
between the aromatic and terpyridine units of tpy-pvp-X. Small blue
shift of MLCT and ILCT bands is observed on passing from trans–trans
to trans–cis and finally to cis–cis forms. Further insight
for the assignment of bands are obtained from natural transition orbital
(NTO) analysis (Figures S25–S27, Supporting Information) and electron density difference map (EDDM) (Figure 4). Both NTO and EDDM
plots again confirm that the band at lowest energy is an admixture
of MLCT as well as ILCT characters.

S0 state to the lowest-energy singlet excited state in

of increasing and decreasing and increasing electron density, respectively.

UKS calculations helped to get
some insight about their emission
spectral properties. Optimized geometries and metrical parameters
are given in Figure S28 and Tables S2–S6 (Supporting Information). Theoretical emission band varies
between 634 (3) and 644 nm (2) for trans–trans,
between 631 (3) and 639 nm (2) for trans–cis,
and between 627 (3) and 630 nm (5) for cis–cis
forms, depending the electronic nature of X in the complexes (Table 1).

Electrochemical Behaviors
The electrochemical
data
of 1–5 in acetonitrile are given in the Supporting Information (Table S17). The representative
cyclic voltammogram of 1 is displayed in the Supporting Information (Figure S29). The reversible
wave at around 1.28 V is due to oxidation of RuII to RuIII in the complexes. On the other hand, the waves observed
in the range of −0.91 to −1.47 V are due to the reductions
of terpyridine units as well as for NO2 group (for 4). Cyclic voltammogram for the reduction side of the nitro
compound (4) is interesting and quite different from
the rest of the series (Figure S30, Supporting Information), and complex 4 exhibits three successive
reduction waves between −0.91 and −1.47 V, whereas the
remaining complexes show two reduction waves between −1.03
and −1.40 V. Thus, first reduction for 4 corresponds
to the reduction of the nitro groups within the complex. Electrochemical
behaviors were also supported by DFT-calculated results. Spin density
calculations have also been done and relevant plots are presented
in Figure S31 (Supporting Information).
Spin density was predominantly localized on Ru in the one-electron
oxidized form, while on terpyridine moiety upon reduction with the
exception of 4, for which the density is mostly localized
on nitrobenzene unit in the reduction process.

Absorption Spectra
Absorption spectral characteristics
of the compounds were studied in both acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and relevant spectral data are collected in Table 2, whereas corresponding profiles
are displayed in Figures 5a and S32a (Supporting Information). The spectral pattern is very similar, and each of them shows a
number of intense bands in both UV and visible domain. Experimental
data of structurally related complexes and results of TD-DFT computation
indicate that the band within 495 and 507 nm is a combination of 1[RuII(d)6] → 1[RuII(d)5tpy-pvp-X(π*)1] MLCT and
ILCT transitions. The band within 355 and 379 nm mainly comprises
ILCT transitions, whereas very intense UV bands arise from π–π*
transitions in aromatic and heteroaromatic moieties of tpy-pvp-X ligands.
The correlation among the calculated and experimental data is usually
good. MLCT band is shifted to a longer wavelength with respect to
[Ru(tpy)2]2+ (474 nm)38 as styrylbenzene units induce extensive electronic delocalization
toward the terpyridine unit. In addition, the peak position of both
MLCT and ILCT band varies with the nature of X.

Emission Properties
At RT, both emission spectra and
luminescence lifetimes were recorded in acetonitrile and DMSO, while
at 77 K, the same measurements were performed in EtOH–MeOH
glass (4:1, v/v). Relevant photophysical parameters are mentioned
in Table 2, and corresponding
emission spectra are displayed in Figures 5b and S32b (Supporting Information). Irradiation at MLCT results a moderately strong
luminescence band with their peak maximum varying between 658 (1) and 669 nm (4) in acetonitrile and between
669 (1) and 679 nm (4) in DMSO at RT. It
is to be noted that a small overlapping band at ∼590 nm is
visible in all cases, which is probably due to the phosphorescence
from the 3π,π* state of styrylbenzene moiety.
The possibility of ligand impurity is completely ruled out as free
tpy-vpv-X ligands exhibit fluorescence from the 1π,π*
state within the range of 400–420 nm. We have deconvoluted
the emission spectra of the complexes to obtain an individual spectrum
(Figures S33–S34, Supporting Information), and radiative and nonradiative rate constant values that are provided
in Table 2 are based
on deconvoluted spectra. At 77 K, the emission maximum within 647
(1) and 660 nm (4) is blue-shifted along
with the significant enhancement of both emission intensity and quantum
yields (Figure S35, Supporting Information).

The lifetime of complexes varied between 10.0 (4) and 67.7 ns (2) in acetonitrile (Figure S36, Supporting Information), whereas in DMSO, the
lifetimes increased substantially with their values lying between
43.0 (4) and 158.5 ns (2) (Figure S37, Supporting Information). Like MLCT absorption
maximum, emission peak also varies with the electronic nature of X,
but no linear correlation is obtained between the emission energy
and the Hammett σp parameters. By contrast, the lifetime
of the complexes increases systematically upon increasing the electron-donating
nature of X yielding a linear plot between the lifetime and Hammett
σp parameters in both acetonitrile and DMSO at RT
(Figure 6a). In a frozen
matrix, enhancement of lifetime is enormous compared to the fluid
solution for all the complexes as expected, and the observed lifetime
was found to lie between 35.2 (4) and 47.3 μs (2) at 77 K (Figure S38, Supporting Information). Interestingly, 77 K emission lifetime of the complexes also vary
systematically with the electronic nature of X, and a reasonably good
linear correlation was found between the lifetime and Hammett σp parameters (Figure 6b).80,90

Figure 6 Plot of lifetime of 1–5 vs Hammett σp parameters at RT (a) and at 77 K
(b).

The complexes exhibit biexponential
decay in both acetonitrile
and DMSO at RT. It is probable that the initial short component accounts
for deactivation of the 3MLCT state, whereas the long-lived
species arises from the equilibrated triplet state of 3MLCT and styrylbenzene units. The emission profiles of complexes
at 77 K exhibit clean vibrational progression with their spacing in
the range of 1224–1372 cm–1, indicating substantial
participation of the triplet ligand-centered emission (Figure S35, Supporting Information). The emission maxima
at 77 K also give rise to the estimate of their zero–zero spectroscopic
energy (E00) and estimated values were
found to vary between 1.88 and 1.92 eV, depending on the nature of
X in the complexes. Thus, an interesting and significant aspect is
the design of new Ru(II)–terpyridine complexes that exhibit
moderately strong emission at RT with their lifetimes varying between
10.0 and 158.5 ns. In our previous report, we showed that incorporation
of one styrylbenzene–terpyridine conjugate leads to the enhancement
of lifetime up to 22.82 ns in a related heteroleptic series where
the extent of enhancement was 2 orders of magnitude higher than the
[Ru(tpy)2]2+ complex (τ = 0.25 ns).48 In the present series of homoleptic complexes,
incorporation of two styrylbenzene–terpyridine ligands around
the Ru(II) center provides greater electron delocalization in the
excited state, resulting in a substantial increase of the lifetime
at RT and the extent of enhancement is about 3 orders of magnitude
higher compared with the parent [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (τ = 0.25 ns). Moreover, their lifetimes also systematically
varied with the electronic nature of X, yielding a good correlation
with Hammett σp parameters.

Photoisomerization Studies
Because of the presence
of two photoisomerizable C=C units, each complex undergoes
trans–cis isomerization induced by light. Photoisomerization
was initially performed in both acetonitrile and DMSO as most of the
photophysical and electrochemical studies were carried out in these
solvents. As the isomerization process is very slow in these solvents,
we use 1:50 (v/v) acetonitrile–DCM mixture for the purpose
of photoisomerization studies. Irradiation of the solution of complexes
with UV light induces a systematic and substantial UV–vis absorption
spectral change in all cases with clean and well-defined isosbestic
point in each case as displayed in Figures 7a,c,e and S39 (Supporting Information). During photolysis, both MLCT and ILCT bands gradually
lose their intensities, although the extent of decrease of the ILCT
band is more pronounced than the MLCT band in all cases. The decrease
of MLCT and ILCT band intensities is accompanied by the increase of
intensity of π–π* bands. The extent of decrease
varies between 30 and 45% for the MLCT band and between 70–88%
for the ILCT band (in the range of 360–380 nm), while the extent
of increase of π–π* band at ∼290 nm varies
between 30 and 75% in the complexes. The time required to reach the
saturation point vary between 170 m (1) and 300 m (4), depending on the electronic property of X. Small but finite
blue shift of the MLCT band was noticed for all complexes upon photolysis.
The reverse process also occurs on irradiation with visible light,
but the rate is extremely slow compared with the forward process.
Upon irradiation with UV light, almost complete quenching (∼80%)
accompanied with small blue shift of emission band was noticed in
all complexes (Figures 7b,d,f and S39, Supporting Information).
Reverse process upon interaction with visible light again restores
the original emission. Interestingly, “on–off”
and “off–on” switching of emission is feasible
on treating with UV and visible light successively.

Figure 7 Changes in absorption
and luminescence (λex =
500 nm) spectra of 2 (a,b, respectively), 4 (c,d, respectively), and 5 (e,f, respectively) in MeCN–DCM
(1:50 v/v) upon excitation with UV light. Changes in lifetime upon
photolysis are shown in the insets.

The observed spectral change is associated with the conversion
of either one or both styrylbenzene units from the trans- to the cis-form
that is either from initial trans–trans to trans–cis
or to the cis–cis form in the complexes. In order to understand
the mode of isomerization process, we also acquired the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 in DMSO-d6–CDCl3 (1:4, v/v) after photolysis of ∼10
h (Figure 8). It is observed that H9 and H10 protons
associated with ethylenic double bond as well as H7, H8 H11, and H12
protons adjacent to the double bond are shifted toward the upfield
region, albeit in small extent. In the initial trans–trans
orientation, H9 and H10 protons associated with ethylenic double bond
appeared in the range of 7.07–6.96 ppm with the value of coupling
constant J ≈ 16 ppm. The spectrum obtained
after photolysis shows two doublet signals within the range of 6.72–6.64
ppm with J ≈ 12 ppm, indicating the signature
of cis-olefinic hydrogens. In addition, unresolved
overlapping features are also observed in the range of 7.08–6.93
ppm because of the coexistence of H9, H10, H11′, and H12′
protons. Thus, 1H NMR spectral studies suggest that photoisomerization
involves the conversion from trans–trans to trans–cis
form.

(b).

In previous section, we have performed
TD-DFT as well as UKS calculations
in three forms of the complexes. The experimentally observed position
of MLCT absorption and luminescence band after photolysis correlates
better with trans–cis forms compared with their cis–cis
orientation (Tables 1, S12–S16, Figures 9, and S40–S42 Supporting Information). Thus, both experimental observation
and theoretical calculations suggest conversion from trans–trans
to the corresponding trans–cis forms upon irradiation with
UV light for all complexes.

(pink), trans–cis
(blue), and cis–cis (green)} and observed (solid lines) absorption
spectra of 2 and 3 in MeCN.

In line with steady-state spectra, decrease in
lifetime (∼65%)
was also observed for all these compounds upon photolysis. It should
be mentioned that the lifetime of complexes in acetonitrile–DCM
(1:50, v/v) is much higher (varying between 25.2 ns (4) and 121.5 ns (2)) compared with neat MeCN, while little
less compared with DMSO. Moreover, linear correlation is observed
upon plotting lifetimes of both trans–trans and trans–cis
forms and Hammett σp parameters (Figure 10). It is to be noted that
the lifetime of the complexes increases systematically upon increasing
the electron donating capability of X (Figures 6 and 10). Although
the actual cause of this trend cannot be explained with a clear view,
the substituent X probably affects 3π,π* or 3ILCT state to a greater extent compared with the 3MLCT state in the complexes. We suggested that the biexponential
decay profiles indicated the coexistence of 3MLCT and 3ILCT or 3π,π* excited states under
equilibrium at RT. It is expected that with an electron donating substituent,
the energy difference between 3MLCT and 3ILCT
or 3π,π* excited states is less, or in other
words, the extent of excited-state equilibrium is greater, and as
a result, the contribution of 3ILCT or 3π,π*
excited state on the lifetime of the complexes is greater. By contrast,
with an electron-withdrawing substituent (nitro-group), the contribution
of 3MLCT is expected to be much higher.

the complexes (both trans–trans and
trans–cis forms) in MeCN–DCM (1:50, v/v) vs Hammett
σp parameters with linear least square fits to the
data.

The reason for emission quenching
upon trans–trans to trans–cis
transformation is again not very clear to us. We believe that 3π,π* excited state played a definite role in the
isomerization process. Conversion from trans–trans to trans–cis
form imparts considerable strain and decreases π-conjugation
to some extent, on and around C=C, which in turn perturbs the
equilibrated 3MLCT and 3ILCT or 3π,π* excited states at RT.

The rate and the rate
constant of the photoinduced isomerization
process were evaluated from the absorption titration data. Isomerization
at the initial stage of photolysis obeys first-order kinetics, as
at the initial stage, the reverse isomerization rate for both photo
and thermal pathway is extremely slow. Estimated rate constants vary
in the range between 1.25 × 10–4 and 2.54 ×
10–4 s–1 (Figures S43–S44, Supporting Information). The intensity of light
was 0.11 W. The quantum yields of trans–trans to trans–cis
conversion were calculated by adopting the process given in the experimental
section of the Supporting Information.
Quantum yield values are found to be low for all cases and lie in
the range of 1.00 × 10–5 and 4.62 × 10–5 (Table 3). Interestingly, the rate constants as well as the quantum yields
of the photoisomerization process increase systematically upon increasing
the electron donating nature of X in the complexes, and a linear correlation
is observed upon plotting both rate constants and quantum yields of
the photoisomerization process versus Hammett σp parameters
(Figure 11).

Conclusions
Synthesis
and structural characterization of a new type of homoleptic
terpyridine complexes of Ru(II) containing styrylbenzene moieties
were undertaken in this work to improve the RT luminescence properties.
Photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies were carried
out in detail. In our previous report, we demonstrated that incorporation
of one styrylbenzene unit leads to the enhancement of RT lifetime
up to 22.82 ns in the heteroleptic Ru(II)–terpyridine complexes.
In the present study, incorporation of two styrylbenzene–terpyridine
ligands provides greater electron delocalization in the excited states,
resulting in substantial enhancement of the lifetime (between 10.0
and 158.5 ns, dependent on X and solvent), and the extent of enhancement
is about 3 orders of magnitude higher compared with the parent [Ru(tpy)2]2+ complex (τ = 0.25 ns). Moreover, lifetimes
in both of their trans–trans and trans–cis forms systematically
varied with the electronic nature of X, yielding a good correlation
with Hammett σp parameters. The biexponential decays
indicate that the 3MLCT and 3IL states are in
equilibrium at RT.

Another important aspect is that the presence
of two styrylbenzene
groups induces trans–trans to trans–cis isomerization
on irradiation with UV light, resulting in considerable changes in
their electronic absorption and emission spectral profiles. Reversal
of the process also occurs upon interaction with visible light. Interestingly,
trans–trans to trans–cis process induces emission quenching,
whereas the reverse process leads to the restoration of the original
emission. Thus, “on–off” and “off–on”
switching of emission is feasible on treating with UV and visible
light successively. Thus, the present complexes could be potential
building blocks with regard to information storage and photoswitching
molecular devices.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
ligands tpy-pvp-X (X = H, Me, Cl, NO2, and Ph) were synthesized
and thoroughly characterized by
our recent reported procedure.89 RuCl3·xH2O and sodium perchlorate
were purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals and solvents employed in
this study were procured from local vendors.

Synthesis of Metal Complexes
Complexes were prepared
by adopting a common procedure which is described below.

[Ru(tpy-pvp-H)2](ClO4)2·H2O (1)
A mixture of tpy-pvp-H (0.18 g,
0.44 mmol) and RuCl3·3H2O (0.05 g, 0.2
mmol) in 25 mL of ethylene glycol was heated at 180 °C with stirring
for 6 h under Ar atmosphere when a red solution was formed. After
cooling, the solution was poured into NaClO4·H2O (1.5 g in 5 mL of water) and stirred for few minutes until
a red-colored precipitate appeared. The compound was filtered and
purified by silica gel column chromatography using MeCN as the eluent.
Upon rotary evaporation of the eluent to a small volume (∼10
mL), a microcrystalline complex was formed, which was filtered and
recrystallized from the MeCN–MeOH (1:5, v/v) mixture. Yield:
