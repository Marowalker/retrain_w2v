Here,
a systematic study of the roles played by Pd seeds during
seed-mediated coreduction of Pd–Pt is presented. Either nanoparticles
with porous, hollow architectures or concave nanocubes were achieved,
depending on whether the synthesis conditions favored galvanic replacement
or overgrowth. Prior works have shown that the galvanic replacement
reaction between seeds and a precursor can be suppressed by introducing
a faster, parallel reaction that removes one of the reagents (e.g.,
adatom generation in solution rather than surface-catalyzed precursor
reduction). Here, we show that the galvanic replacement reaction depends
on the size and concentration of the Pd seeds; the former of which
can be manipulated during the course of the reaction through the use
of a secondary reducing agent. This insight will guide future syntheses
of multimetallic nanostructures by seeded methods, allowing for a
range of nanocrystals to be precisely engineered for a variety of
applications.

Introduction
Many efforts have been
directed toward the shape-controlled synthesis
of metal nanoparticles using preformed metal seeds and/or chemical
structure directing agents and surfactants.1−4 However, seed-mediated methods
have attracted a great deal of attention because of their ability
to precisely engineer the nanocrystal shape and achieve nanocrystals
with defined shapes, complex compositions, and even hierarchical structures.4−14 Metal nanostructures prepared by seeded methods have potential applications
in catalysis, plasmonics, nanomedicine, and more.15−19 Owing to the dependency of properties on composition
and structural parameters, gaining insights into nanomaterial formation
and developing new synthetic strategies to well-defined nanomaterials
are paramount.15,20,21 Recently, seed-mediated coreduction has emerged as a premier route
to multimetallic nanostructures, where multiple metal precursors are
simultaneously reduced to deposit alloyed shells on shape-controlled
metal seeds where the symmetry of the seeds is transferred to the
multimetallic structure.4,22,23 In most demonstrations, the seeds used in this method do not have
a sufficiently low reduction potential relative to the selected precursors
for galvanic replacement (i.e., where the seeds themselves serve as
the reducing agent, facilitating metal precursor reduction and deposition)
to occur.24 Thus, a molecular reducing
agent (e.g., l-ascorbic acid, l-aa) is employed
to facilitate seed-mediated coreduction. Recently, Qin and co-workers
reported codeposition of Pd–Ag and Ag–Au shells on Ag
nanocube seeds, where the standard reduction potentials of the Pd
and Au precursors relative to Ag were sufficient to facilitate galvanic
replacement along with codeposition.25−27 This method produced
Ag-enriched bimetallic surfaces through the titration of l-aa to reduce the Ag salt released by galvanic replacement of the
nanocube templates. Interestingly, the hollowing of the Ag templates
that characterizes galvanic replacement processes can be suppressed
completely by tuning the pH of the l-aa solution. These nanostructures
provide unique platforms for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,
where the Ag provides high sensitivity and the other metals can serve
as catalysts.

Here, a systematic study of the roles played by
Pd seeds during
seed-mediated coreduction of Pd and Pt precursors is presented. Pd–Pt
nanostructures have shown high catalytic activity specially for fuel
cell reactions such as oxygen reduction reaction, methanol oxidation
reaction, and formic acid oxidation reaction.28,29 Insights into the synthesis of such materials with structural precision
is paramount to the design of new catalysts. This synthetic system
is similar to those studied by Qin and co-workers in that the standard
reduction potentials ([PtBr6]2–/([PtBr4]2–: 0.613 V vs standard hydrogen electrode
(SHE), [PtBr4]2–/Pt: 0.698 V vs SHE,
and [PdBr4]2–/Pd: 0.49 V vs SHE) should
facilitate galvanic replacement of the Pd seeds by the Pt precursor.27 Likewise, l-aa was added to the system
to facilitate reduction of the Pd precursor and any salt released
from the template seeds. In this way, a bimetallic surface should
be deposited on the seeds. Xia and co-workers have examined the galvanic
replacement between H2PtCl6 and Pd nanocrystals,
and the addition of citric acid as a secondary reducing agent was
found to facilitate the coreduction of PdCl42– derived from the galvanic replacement in addition to the original
PtCl42– present in the system. Pd–Pt
alloy nanocages were produced in this example.30 They also demonstrated how bromide can direct a galvanic
replacement reaction and could be used for the synthesis of concave
Pd–Pt nanocrystals using Pd nanocubes as seeds. Specifically,
galvanic replacement was initiated and facilitated by the preferential
adsorption of Br– ions on {100} crystallographic
facets of Pd seeds. Simultaneous dissolution of Pd atoms from {100}
facets and deposition of Pt atoms on {111} facets led to the formation
of concave Pd@Pt nanocrystals.31 Here,
we show that whether or not the galvanic replacement reaction proceeds
depends on the size and concentration of the Pd seeds; the former
of which can be manipulated during the course of the reaction through
the use of the secondary reducing agent, l-aa.

Results and Discussion
Pd nanocubes with an average edge length of 18 ± 2 nm (unless
otherwise noted) were prepared by standard methods.12 These nanocrystals then served as seeds during the coreduction
of H2PtCl6 and H2PdCl4 (1-to-1 mole ratio unless noted) with l-aa in an aqueous
solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a capping agent.
The synthesis was conducted at 55 °C. When only H2PdCl4 is available for reduction, conformal Pd deposition
occurs on the Pd nanocubes, as evident by the increase in Pd particle
size from 18 ± 2 to 32 ± 2.1 nm (Figure S1a). When only H2PtCl6 is available
for reduction, porous Pd–Pt structures are produced, where
the porosity indicates that precursor reduction is facilitated by
galvanic replacement (Figure S1b). In contrast, Figure 1a shows a transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of partially hollow nanoparticles
with cubic profiles that are obtained from when H2PtCl6 and H2PdCl4 are coreduced in the presence
of Pd nanocubes. The contrast between the lighter centers and darker
peripheries is consistent with hollow structures. As shown by elemental
mapping from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled
with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Pd is concentrated
at the interior walls of the hollow cubes and Pt is concentrated at
the outer edges of the cubes (Figure 1b). Porous, hollow core@shell Pd@Pt nanostructures
are produced.

image (b-1)
and Pt (b-2) and Pd (b-3) elemental mapping by STEM–EDS of
an individual nanoparticle.

The hollow architecture indicates that galvanic replacement
is
occurring even with l-aa present. We note that nearly collapsed
structures are obtained without l-aa, highlighting its role
in depositing Pd to preserve the cubic shape of the seed template
(Figure S2). This dependency of the final
structure on the reducing capacity of the reductant was also observed
in galvanic replacement between Au salts and Ag templates.32,33Figure S3 shows TEM images of the progression
from solid Pd nanocubes to the hollow, porous Pd@Pt nanostructures
synthesized through codeposition. As shown in Figure S3c, the dissolution of Pd seeds is initiated at the
sides of the nanocubes as Pt ions are reduced and deposited on nanocubes.
Further Pd dissolution and Pt deposition leads to the formation of
hollow, porous Pd@Pt structures after 18 h.

Interestingly, when
the concentration of Pd seeds was decreased
by 100 times (10 μL of seed solution compared to 1 mL), neither
etching of the Pd nanocubes by Pt ions nor Pt deposition on the Pd
nanocubes were observed. Figure 2 shows the TEM image of the product. Nanocubes with
an average edge length of 33 ± 1.9 nm were produced. The STEM
image (Figure 2c) suggests
slightly concave surfaces on account of the darker contrast in the
center of the particles compared to the edges. The larger size of
the resulting nanocubes compared to the initial Pd seeds (18 ±
2 nm) as well as no Pt being detected by EDS indicates that Pd deposition
on the Pd seeds is dominant. A complete seed concentration study can
be found in Figure S4, which shows that
as the concentration of seeds in solution increases, the size of the
obtained product decreases and the degree of hollowing increases.

and Pd (c-2) elemental mapping by STEM–EDS from an individual
nanoparticle.

Figure S5 shows TEM images of the sample
from Figure 2 as Pd
deposition on the Pd nanocubes progresses, with the final size and
morphology obtained within half an hour of reaction. No structural
or compositional changes were observed with longer reaction times.
The deposition of Pd before Pt during coreduction of Pd and Pt precursors
has been reported previously, supporting the greater ease of Pd precursor
reduction observed in our synthesis.34−36 Still, the observation
of Pd seeds hollowing when their concentration in solution is higher
suggests a seed size dependence to whether or not galvanic replacement
or deposition will occur.

To understand the role of the seed-to-metal
precursor ratio, a
scheme outlining the shape and compositional transformations at different
stages of the reaction for both high and low seed concentrations is
shown in Figure 3.
At a high seed-to-metal precursor ratio, the amount of Pd deposition per seed will be lower than that at low seed-to-metal precursor
ratios. Thus, the change in Pd nanocube size at high seed-to-metal
precursor ratios will be minimal, maintaining the electrochemical
potential difference required for galvanic replacement and a suitable
amount of Pt precursor available for galvanic replacement. At a lower
seed-to-metal precursor ratio (Figure 3b), the rapid growth in particle size can both diminish
the driving force for exchange and decrease the amount of Pt precursor
available for notable exchange as the effective size of the Pd seeds
is much larger.

Figure 3 Schematic illustrating the major morphological and compositional
changes at (a) high seed-to-metal precursor ratio and (b) low seed-to-metal
precursor ratio (red color represents Pd, and green represents Pt).

To demonstrate how seed size affects
galvanic replacement or deposition,
seeds with two different edge lengths, 24 ± 2.5 and 46 ±
2.6 nm, were directly compared to one another and the original Pd
nanocubes with an average edge length of 18 ± 2 nm. The products
produced under standard conditions were characterized by TEM (Figure S6). The product obtained from Pd seeds
with an average edge length of 24 nm shows some slight pitting, but
the structures are not nearly as hollowed out as when smaller Pd nanocubes
(18 nm) are used as seeds (Figure 1a). No cavities are observed when the larger Pd nanocubes
(edge length of 46 ± 2.6 nm) are used as seeds. These results
again support the size dependence to whether or not galvanic replacement
occurs.

As the difference in the electrochemical reduction potentials
between
a sacrificial Pd template and Pt metal complexes is the main driving
force for Pt deposition, the extent of the galvanic replacement reaction
could be controlled by changing the amount of Pt salt. As shown in Figure 4, increasing the
Pt concentration from 120 to 480 μM results in a slightly different
morphology. The nanoparticles are still porous; however, the hollow
interior is smaller. We attribute this finding to restructuring as
the replacement process becomes more extensive and alloy formation
proceeds through codeposition and diffusion. Figure 5 shows elemental mapping by STEM–EDS
of the product shown in Figure 4c indicating overlap between Pd and Pt signals and not a core@shell
architecture as in Figure 1.

Figure 4 TEM images of the Pd@Pt nanoparticles prepared using Pt precursor
solutions of different concentrations: (a) 120, (b) 240, and (c) 480
μM. Pd concentration in all samples is 120 μM.

Figure 5 (a) STEM image. (b) Pd and (c) Pt elemental mapping from
Pd@Pt
nanoparticles shown in Figure 4c.

Notably, the extent of galvanic
replacement and Pt incorporation
can be suppressed by increasing either the amount of l-aa
(Figures S7) or the reaction pH (on account
of the pH-dependent reducing capabilities of l-aa; Figure S8). These dependences are in addition
to the seed size dependence reported here for the first time.

Conclusions
In conclusion, core@shell Pd@Pt nanoparticles with porous hollow
architectures are obtained by seed-mediated coreduction of Pd and
Pt precursors in the presence of Pd nanocubes. Galvanic replacement
between the Pd nanocubes and Pt precursor accounts for the hollow
nature of the nanoparticles. Interestingly, simply changing the concentration
of seeds in solution results in concave Pd nanocubes. Pt could not
be incorporated facilely. As the external reducing agent, l-aa could not reduce the Pt precursor; the absence of Pt in the product
particles illustrates the size dependence to the galvanic replacement
process in this system. The elucidation of this dependence will allow
experimentalists to select between overgrowth and galvanic replacement
and ultimately synthesize nanocrystals with desired composition and
morphology by seed-mediated coreduction.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Materials
Hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide or CTAB (C19H42NBr, 98%), l-aa (C6H8O6, 99%), PdCl2 (99.98%), and H2PtCl6·6H2O
(99.98%) were used as purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid
(HCl, 12.1 M) was purchased from Mallinckrodt. Nanopure water with
resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm was used in all experiments.
H2PdCl4 solution (10 mM) was prepared by stirring
17.7 mg of PdCl2 in 10 mL of HCl (20 mM) for 2 h while
heating and stirring at 40 °C.

Synthesis
Pd Nanocubes
(18 nm)
To synthesize small nanocubes,
0.5 mL H2PdCl4 (10 mM) was added to 10 mL CTAB
(12.5 mM) and preheated in a 95 °C oil bath for 5 min. Then,
0.08 mL l-aa (100 mM) was added. The mixture was stirred
for 30 min in the 95 °C oil bath and kept at 40 °C before
using as the seed for large nanocubes or PdPt synthesis. Prior to
use for PdPt synthesis, the solution was centrifuged and diluted to
1 mL.

Large Pd Nanocubes
To synthesize large nanocubes, 0.125
mL H2PdCl4 (10 mM) was added to 5 mL CTAB (50
mM) and stirred in a 40 °C oil bath. Then, a certain amount of
unwashed Pd nanocubes was injected (0.07 mL for 24 nm and 0.01 mL
for 46 nm Pd nanocubes), and 0.025 mL l-aa (100 mM) was added
to the mixture. After mixing by shaking the vial, it was left for
14 h in a 40 °C oil bath. Prior to use for PdPt synthesis, the
solution was centrifuged and diluted to 1 mL.

In a typical synthesis
of hollow Pd–Pt nanoparticles, 60 μL H2PdCl4 (10 mM) and 60 μL H2PtCl6 (10
mM) were added to 5 mL CTAB (50 mM) solution and stirred in a 55 °C
oil bath. Then, 1 mL of the above-mentioned small Pd seeds and 0.025
mL l-aa (100 mM) were injected to the mixture. After mixing
by shaking the vial, it was left 24 h in a 55 °C oil bath.

Characterization
TEM images were taken by a JEOL JEM
1010 microscope operating at 80 kV. High-resolution TEM images and
EDS spectra were obtained via a JEOL JEM 3200FS microscope (operating
at 300 kV) interfaced with a liquid nitrogen cooled Oxford INCA dispersive
X-ray system. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy samples
were prepared by drop-casting a dispersed particle solution onto a
300-mesh carbon-coated copper TEM grid (Formvar removed by dipping
in chloroform).
