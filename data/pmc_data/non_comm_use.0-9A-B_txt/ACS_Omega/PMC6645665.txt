theory. In addition, the Schottky barrier diode parameters for compound 1 demonstrate better device performance after light soaking.

Introduction
In modern trends of
materials science, coordination chemistry is one of the eye catching
areas for its versatile applications.1−3 The advancement of laboratory
to land application of this chemistry hides within the structural
features. During the past few decades, polymeric coordination entities
have been used in the field of materials chemistry for their architectural
beauty as well as wide spectrum of applications.4−10 These types of inorganic–organic hybrid polymeric coordination
entities are known as coordination polymers (CPs). CPs are generally
composed of metal ions or metal-ion clusters linked by organic ligands
in an array. Depending upon the applications, one can choose a particular
type of organic ligands. However, researchers are interested in mixed
organic ligands instead of single one, whereby the structural dimensionality
can easily be tuned.11−13 Because of their structural diversity, CPs are potentially
applicable in sorption and separation of gases, catalysis, fluorosensors,
drug delivery, sensing studies, energy storage, magnetism, and ion
exchanging.14−25 Recently, the electrical conductivity of these materials has been
largely studied and interest continues unabated.26,27 The electrical properties of CPs are not very attractive because
of the presence of dicarboxylic acids containing lot of insulating
carbon atoms or chains present in molecular assembly. However, the
judicious selection of auxiliary ligands may influence the charge
transport properties and semiconducting behavior of the compound.28−31 It has been observed that the π···π stacking
interactions between highly conjugated electron-rich aromatic moieties
happen to enhance charge mobility in CPs.32 In addition, thermal, chemical, and structural stability of these
compounds tempted the researchers to use them in the field of semiconductors.
Inspired by these ideas, our group designed and synthesized a number
of CPs which are shown to possess electrical conductivity and are
useful for the fabrication of electronic devices.33−36 Most of the cases, the structure
property relationship is very much important for the application in
this field.

Herein, we present a Zn(II)-based one-dimensional
CP (1D CP) [Zn(adc)(4-nvp)2(H2O)2]n (1), synthesized using
actylenedicarboxylic acid (H2adc) as a linear organic linker
along with co-ligand 4-(1-naphthylvinyl)pyridine (4-nvp). The structure
of the compound 1 is supported by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction measurement and various spectroscopic techniques. Simultaneously,
the presence of hydrogen bonding, C–H···π,
and π···π stacking interactions leads to
the construction of a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular network
in the solid-state crystal structure. The presence of π···π
stacking interactions among the pyridine and naphthalene rings of
the adjacent chains facilitates the charge transport properties of
the compound, resulting in the high electrical conductivity. In addition,
stacked 4-nvp ligands may attain maximum planarity under photoirradiation,
ensuring better charge mobility among the aromatic rings along with
the significant enhancement of conductivity. Therefore, this material
has the potential to serve as a photosensitive device.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Physical Measurements
All the chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. and were used
as received. Microanalytical data (C, H and N) were collected on a
PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was
performed in KBr (4500–500 cm–1) using a
PerkinElmer FT-IR RX1 spectrometer. The thermogravimetric data were
collected on PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond TG/DTA in the temperature range
30–550 °C under N2 atmosphere. The powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) of the powdered sample was performed on a Bruker
D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.548 Å) in the 2θ range of 5°–50°.
The electronic spectrum of the compound was recorded with the help
of a PerkinElmer UV–vis spectrophotometer (LAMBDA 35). Solid-state
emission spectra were obtained by using a HORIBA JobinYvon (Fluoromax-4)
fluorescence spectrophotometer.

Synthesis of Compound 1
A solution of 4-nvp (0.046 g, 0.2 mmol) in MeOH
(2 mL) was cautiously layered to a solution of Zn(NO)3·6H2O (0.06 g, 0.2 mmol), in H2O (2 mL) using 2 mL
1:1 (=v/v) buffer solution of CH3CN and H2O.
Then, a solution of H2adc (0.023 g, 0.2 mmol) neutralized
with Et3N (0.021 g, 0.2 mmol) in 2 mL EtOH was layered
upon it. After three days, light yellow color rectangular crystals
of [Zn(adc)(4-nvp)2(H2O)2]n, (1) were obtained in 65% yield (0.088
g). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C38H26N2O6Zn: C, 67.92; H, 3.90; N, 4.17. Found: C, 68.01;

X-ray Crystallography
A suitable
single crystal of the compound 1 was used for data collection
by a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer, having graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structure was
solved by using SHELX-9737 with anisotropic
displacement parameters for all nonhydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms
were constrained to ride on the respective parent atoms. The crystal
data and experimental details for data collection of 1 are reported in Table S1, and selected
bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table S2.

Conductivity Measurements
In order
to perform the electrical study, the multiple metal–semiconductor
(MS) junction device has been fabricated in indium tin oxide (ITO)/compound 1/Al sandwich configuration. For this purpose, the thin film
of well dispersion of as-synthesized compound 1 has been
deposited on the precleaned ITO coated glass substrate with the help
of SCU 2700 spin coating unit and dried subsequently. Dispersion of
compound 1 has been made in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) by mixing and sonicating the right
proportion (40 mg/mL) of compound 1 in a vial. Then,
the dispersion of compound 1 has been deposited on the
top of the ITO-coated glass by spinning first at 800 rpm for 4 min
and thereafter, at 1200 rpm for 6 min. Afterward, the as-deposited
thin film has been dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for several
minutes to evaporate the solvent fully. The thickness of the developed
thin film has been measured by a surface profiler as ∼1 μm.
The aluminum electrodes have been deposited under pressure 10–6 Torr by maintaining the effective area as 7.065 ×
10–2 cm2 with a shadow mask in the vacuum
coating unit 12A4D of HINDHIVAC.

For electrical characterization
of the devices, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured under both dark and illumination
conditions and recorded with the help of a Keithley 2635B source meter
by a two-probe technique. All the measurements were performed at room
temperature and under ambient conditions.

Computational Method
The GAUSSIAN-09 program package38 was
used to generate optimized geometry using density functional theory
(DFT). A hybrid DFT-B3LYP39 functional
was used throughout the calculations. The LanL2DZ basis set was utilized
for all the elements including metal ion Zn(II). To assign the different
low-laying electronic transitions in the experimental spectra, the
time-dependent DFT40−42 calculations of the compound was done. Gauss sum43 was used to calculate the fractional contribution
of various groups to each molecular orbital.

Results and Discussion
Structural
Description of [Zn(adc)(4-nvp)2(H2O)2], (1)
Single-crystal X-ray crystallography
revealed that compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic
space group Pc with two Zn(II) centers (Zn01 and
Zn02). In this compound, two asymmetric units are present because
of the imposing of chirality in the structure. The flack parameter
value of the structure is 0.002(12). The coordination atmospheres
around the metal ions are identical. Zn01 has a distorted octahedral
geometry ligated by two O atoms from two adc anions in monodentate
fashion (Zn–O, 2.075(11)–2.156(10) Å) and two N
atoms from two 4-nvp ligands (Zn–N, 2.200(13)–2.172(13)
Å) in the equatorial position, and by O atoms from two aqua ligands
at the axial sites (Zn–O, 2.082(8)–2.148(8) Å)
(Figure 1a). The Zn02
center also adopts distorted octahedral geometry. Two O atoms from
two different adc anions and two N atoms from two 4-nvp ligands define
the equatorial plane [Zn–O, 2.075(11)–2.156(10) Å;
Zn–N, 2.200(13)–2.172(13) Å], while O atoms from
two aqua ligands are at the axial sites (Zn–O, 2.082(8)–2.148(8)
Å) in the Zn02 center. The connectivity of neighboring dicarboxylate
oxygen atoms with Zn(II) centers results in a 1D chain structure (Figure 1b). The aqua ligands
in 1D chains make strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds with coordinated
O atoms of adc ligands (O···O separation of 2.799–2.85
Å), resulting in the formation of a 2D hydrogen bonding network
in the bc plane (Figure 1c). In addition, pyridine and naphthalene
rings of 4-nvp ligands of adjacent chains undergo face-to-face π···π
interactions in the ac plane with centroid–centroid
distances of 3.789–3.813 Å (Figure 1d). Furthermore, there exist C–H···π
interactions between the parallel chains with edge-to-face distances
in the range of 2.779–3.001 Å (Figure S1).44,45 These hydrogen bonding, π···π,
and C–H···π interactions in 1 fabricate a 3D supramolecular architecture by stacking the 1D chains
together (Figure S2).

Thermogravimetric Analysis and PXRD Analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with the freshly
prepared sample in the temperature range 30–550 °C under
N2 atmosphere. The TGA result shows that the compound 1 is stable up to 120 °C (Figure S3) and can be used in device fabrication. The final residue
is assumed to be ZnO (ca. 12.04%), which is corresponding to the experimental
weight of residue (11.26%). To ensure the purity of the bulk compound,
PXRD has been performed at room temperature with the powdered sample.
Good correspondence exists of the entire peak positions of the simulated
pattern with the as-synthesized 1, suggesting the phase
purity of the bulk (Figure S4).

UV–Vis
Spectroscopy and Band Gap
In this study, the optical characterization
has been carried out using the UV–vis spectrum of the compound 1. It is to be mentioned that the compound produces stable
dispersion in DMF; therefore, thin film on normal glass substrate
has been utilized for solid-state UV–Vis spectroscopy. Here,
the optical spectrum of compound 1 (inset of Figure 2) has been recorded
in the range 250–600 nm, and the direct optical band gap of
the film has been estimated from the UV–vis spectrum using
Tauc’s equation.46 1  where α, Eg, h, and ν stand for absorption coefficient, band gap, Planck’s
constant, and frequency of light. A is a constant
which is considered as 1 for the ideal case. From the Tauc’s
plot, the direct optical band gap (Eg)
of the compound 1 has been estimated as 3.33 eV by extrapolating
the linear region of the plot (αhν)2 versus hν (Figure 2) to α = 0 absorption.

Figure 2 UV–vis absorption
spectra (inset) and Tauc’s plot for compound 1.

DFT Computation and Band
Gap
For Schottky electrical contact, lattice matching and
deformation potentials have been used. The deformation corresponding
to the energy gap between the conduction and valence band refers to
the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbitals
(HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) (ΔE = ELUMO – EHOMO, eV). In the case of polymeric coordination compounds,
the band gap is determined by using absolute deformation potentials.47 As the polymeric coordination compounds, that
is, CPs are mainly composed of inorganic and organic hybrid materials,
the band gap is supposed to be influenced by the electronic nature
of both the components. For the CPs made of d10 metal ions,
the band edges are obtained by the electronic states of the ligand
system as well as the geometry factor of the framework.48 Therefore, the optimized structure of the coordination
unit of 1 has been used to calculate ΔE (3.52 eV, Figure 3), which is in good agreement with the band gap obtained from Tauc’s
plot.

Figure 3 DFT computed energy of molecular orbitals and the energy gap of HOMO
and LUMO of 1.

A minor variance in the computed band gap could be designated
to the geometry factor that has not been taken into the consideration
during theoretical calculations using a single unit of the polymer.
All the transitions in the compound 1 are intraligand
charge transfer (ILCT) in nature. The relationships of theoretical
electronic transitions with experimental data of 1 are
listed in Table S3.

Photophysical Properties
In this work, room-temperature luminescence emission properties
of the compound 1 and free 4-nvp ligand were studied.
The results show that 4-nvp ligand displays a strong emission with
maxima at 418 nm (Figure S5) upon excitation
at absorption maxima ∼380 nm, corresponding to the ILCT. This
charge transfer can be ascribed as n → π and π
→ π transitions. It is to be mentioned that the emission
intensity of 1 has been found to be similar with respect
to free ligand. In addition, the luminescent properties of CPs with
d10 metal ions have attained a large interest because of their possible
application in the field of sensors, electroluminescence display,
and optical devices. To obtain the information about the chemical
environment of the molecules and their assemblies, lifetime data of
free ligand as well as the compound 1 have been estimated
upon excitation at 418 nm. Notably, the average lifetime of compound 1 improves relating to the 4-nvp ligand (Figure S6).

Dielectric Characterization
As the
obtained value of direct optical band gap fell well in the semiconductor
region, it further prompted us to look into the inherent conductivity
of the compound 1. Hence, we have performed the electrical
characterization of 1 in terms of the dielectric study.
Here, the study has been performed by estimating capacitance (C), impedance (Z), and phase angle (θ)
of the compound 1 as a function of frequency (40 Hz to
11 MHz). For this purpose, polished pellets of the compound 1 have been taken along with high purity ultrafine silver
paste used as the electrode on the opposite surfaces of the pellets.

For the compound 1, the complex plane impedance plot,
that is, Nyquist plot is shown in Figure 4A, and the logarithmic angular frequency
dependent phase plot (Bode plot) is represented in Figure 4B. The Nyquist plot of the
compound 1 comprises a depressed semicircular arc which
is assumed to be contributed by semiconducting grains in the high
frequency region. The semicircle at the high frequency region is related
to the electrode resistance. From the radius of the semicircle, the
charge transfer resistance Rct (dc resistance)
of the compound 1 at the electrode/composite interface
has been estimated. The life time (τn) of the charge
carrier has been calculated from the Bode plot (Figure 4B). The phase plot exhibits a peak at ωmax which is inversely related to the charge carrier that is
electron life time (τn = 1/ωmax).49 The life time of the charge carriers obtained
from the Bode plot has been listed in Table 1.

of the compound 1.

Figure 5A shows the frequency
(f) dependency of the ac conductivity of the compound 1. The saturated value at the lower frequency region provides
the dc conductivity of the compound. Figure 5B shows the variation of the capacitance
(C) as a function of the frequency (f) at the constant bias potential. The capacitance decreases with
increase in frequency and becomes saturated at higher frequency from
which the relative permittivity of the compound has been estimated
using the following equation.46 2  where ε0, εr, C, d, and A are the permittivity of free space, dielectric constant of the compound 1, capacitance (at saturation), thickness, and effective area
of the pellet, respectively. Using eq 2, the dielectric constant (εr) of
the compound 1 has been estimated, and all the calculated
parameters are shown in Table 1.

Electrical Properties
The optical band gap falling in semiconducting
regime and large charge carrier life-time prophesies compound 1 to behave as a light-sensitive semiconducting device. Hence,
to get deep into the charge transport mechanism, electrical characterization
has been realized by a metal (Al)–semiconductor (compound 1) (MS) junction thin-film device. To examine the electrical
properties, we have recorded current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of compound 1 under dark and illumination conditions (Figure 6). The conductivity of 1 under
the dark condition is found to be 9.29 × 10–4 S·m–1, indicating the semiconducting nature
of the material. However, the conductivity has been recognizably improved
under photoillumination and measured as 16.58 × 10–4 S·m–1. It can be noticed from the I–V characteristics of Al/compound 1 interfaces that there exists a nonlinear rectifying nature
under both the conditions, representing the formation of a Schottky
barrier diode (SBD). The rectification ratio (Ion/Ioff) of the SBD at ±2
V has been obtained as 41 and 77 under dark and illumination conditions,
respectively. The larger current from the characteristic curve under
light exhibits the photoresponse of the device, which has been found
to be 3.

Figure 6 I–V characteristics curve
of compound 1.

Further, the I–V characteristic of the compound 1 has been investigated
by the thermionic emission theory, employing Cheung’s method,
and the important diode parameters have been estimated.46 For this purpose, we have analyzed I–V curves quantitatively in view of the following
standard equations.46,50 3   4  where I0, q, K, T, V, A, η, A*, ØB are saturation current, electronic charge,
Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, forward bias voltage, effective diode area,
ideality factor, effective Richardson constant, and potential height,
respectively. Here, the effective diode area is 7.065 × 10–2 cm2 and the effective Richardson constant
is 32 A K–2 cm–2 for the device.

We have also calculated the series resistance (RS), ideality factor (η), and barrier potential height
(ØB) by using eqs 5–7 using Cheung’s
idea.51,52 5   6   7  

The series resistances (RS) and ideality
factor (η) for the device under dark and illumination conditions
were calculated from the slope and intercept of dV/d ln I versus I plot (Figure 7A), and the obtained
values have been listed in Table 2. The ideality factor (η) of compound 1 base SBD has been estimated to be 23.18 and 43.26 under dark and
light, respectively. Here, the obtained M–S junction is not
ideal which can be addressed by considering the inhomogeneities of
Schottky barrier height, existence of interface states, and series
resistance.53,54 However, after light soaking,
the value of the ideality factor of compound 1 approaches
a more ideal value (closer to 1), indicating less interfacial charge
recombination and better homogeneity of Schottky junctions.52 Therefore, it may be concluded that compound 1 possesses less carrier recombination at the junction that
is better barrier homogeneity under photoirradiation conditions. The
value of barrier height (ØB) has
been determined from eq 7 using the ideality factor (η). For compound 1, the potential barrier height has been reduced under exposure of
light. The decrease in barrier potential height can be attributed
to the effect of generation and accumulation of photoinduced charge
carriers near the conduction band. The series resistance (RS) can also be calculated from the slope of H versus I plot (Figure 7B). The potential height (ØB), ideality factor (η), and series resistance (RS) under dark and illumination conditions for
the MS junction have been given in Table 2. The series resistances obtained from both
the plots are in good agreement and found to decrease upon light irradiation
(Table 2). Here, the
hanging 4-nvp ligands may attain maximum planarity under photoirradiation
which results in better π···π stacking
interactions among the aromatic rings along with the significant increase
in conductivity.

To shed light on the charge transport
phenomena at the MS junction, it is necessary to analyze the I–V curves in detail. The characteristic I–V curves in the logarithmic scale
under both the conditions exhibit two slopes (Figure 8A) marked as region I and region II. The
value of the slope is ∼1 in region I and current follows the
relation I ∝ V, indicating
the Ohmic regime, whereas the value of the slope is ∼2 in region
II and current is proportional to V2 (Figure 8A), corresponding
to a trap-free space charge-limited current (SCLC) regime.46,55 Here, the SCLC theory has been adopted to estimate the mobility
of the compound.46,55

Figure 8 (A) log I vs log V curves and (B) I vs V2 curves under both dark and illumination conditions for
the compound 1-based thin-film device.

The effective carrier mobility has been determined
from the higher voltage region of I versus V2 graph (Figure 8B) by using the Mott–Gurney equation46,52,55 8  Here, d is the thickness of the film which is taken as ∼1 μm
for compound 1. To determine the charge transport across
the junction, transit time (τ) and diffusion length (LD) of the charge carriers have been estimated.
In this regard, τ has been determined from eq 9, by using the slope of SCLC region (Figure 8A).46 9   10   11  where D is the diffusion coefficient and has been estimated by employing
Einstein–Smoluchowski equation (eq 10).46 During the
formation of the MS junction, diffusion length (LD) of the charge carrier plays a significant role in the
device performance. The diffusion length (LD) has been further obtained from eq 11. All the estimated values of the parameters in the
SCLC region have been listed in Table 3, which reveals that the charge transport properties
of compound 1 have been enhanced upon light irradiation.
The number of charge carriers increases under light and thereby, they
increase in transport rate and mobility. The enhancement of diffusion
length under illumination demonstrates that the charge carriers have
to travel more length before recombination, which leads to the ultimate
increase in current. The diode parameters of the compound 1-based SBD represent much better charge transfer properties after
light irradiation. Therefore, this kind of material has a very promising
prospect in device applications.

Conclusions
In summary, a Zn(II)-based
1D CP has been synthesized from linear dicarboxylate and 4-nvp ligands.
1D chains of the polymeric compound are stacked together via cooperative
supramolecular interactions, namely, H-bonding, C–H···π,
and π···π interactions to form 3D assembly.
A detailed investigation of optical, dielectric, and electrical characterization
was done for the compound. The measured optical band gap and the electrical
conductivity of the compound fall well in the semiconductor regime.
Furthermore, the compound reveals the Schottky diode nature and exhibits
photosensing behavior upon illumination of visible light. Here, the
presence of π···π stacking interactions
among the 4-nvp ligands of adjacent rings assists the high charge
carrier mobility of the material. Therefore, it appears that the compound
can be used in photosensitive electronic devices.
