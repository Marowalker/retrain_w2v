Herein, we report a comprehensive
study on the structural and electronic
properties of bulk, monolayer, and multilayer PdSe2 sheets.
First, we present a benchmark study on the structural properties of
bulk PdSe2 by using 13 commonly used density functional
theory (DFT) functionals. Unexpectedly, the most commonly used van
der Waals (vdW)-correction methods, including DFT-D2, optB88, and
vdW-DF2, fail to provide accurate predictions of lattice parameters
compared to experimental data (relative error > 15%). On the other
hand, the PBE-TS series functionals provide significantly improved
prediction with a relative error of <2%. Unlike hexagonal two-dimensional
materials like graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and h-BN,
the conduction band minimum of monolayer PdSe2 is not located
along the high symmetry lines in the first Brillouin zone; this highlights
the importance of the structure–property relationship in the
pentagonal lattice. Interestingly, high valley convergence is found
in the conduction and valence bands in monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer
PdSe2 sheets, suggesting promising application in thermoelectric
cooling.

Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D)
materials, including graphene, transition
metal dichalcogenides, and phosphorene, have attracted much attention
in recent years due to their remarkable properties and great potential
in nanoelectronic, catalytic, energy conversion and storage, spintronics,
superconductor, and even biological applications.1−25 Recently, studies on a new 2D carbon allotrope, penta-graphene,26 have brought 2D materials with buckled or puckered
pentagonal structures under the spotlight. Unlike hexagonal graphene,
pentagonal graphene is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a sizable
bandgap,26 which can also be efficiently
modulated by surface functionalization.27 According to the structure–property relationship, pentagonal
2D materials with low symmetry can exhibit distinct physical and chemical
properties and open new possibilities for future electronic and optoelectronic
applications.

Besides penta-graphene, many 2D materials with
pentagonal structures,
such as PdS2,28 B2C,29 SiC2,30 SiH,31 and AlN2,32 have emerged. Very recently, a new pentagonal
2D layered noble transition metal dichalcogenide–PdSe2 was fabricated by exfoliation from its bulk phase.33 In contrast to its metallic bulk phase, 2D PdSe2 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of ∼1.30
eV. This makes 2D PdSe2 promising for application in field
effect transistors (FETs) with a high current on/off ratio and low
power dissipation. It was reported that the FET constructed by the
PdSe2 bilayer exhibited an on/off ratio of up to 106, together with a high electron mobility of ∼158 cm2 V–1 s–1.33 More importantly, PdSe2 remains highly stable
even after exposure to air for 60 days,33 demonstrating a potential for practical applications in many important
fields. Obviously, a comprehensive study of the structural and electronic
properties of monolayer, few-layer, and bulk PdSe2, including
the possible stacking patterns, is indispensable to facilitate practical
applications of this novel 2D material.

In this paper, we report
a systematic study of the lattice structure
and electronic properties of bulk and few-layer (1–5 layers)
PdSe2. We conducted a benchmark study on the structural
properties of bulk PdSe2 by using 13 different density
functional theory (DFT) functionals and found that the PBE-TS + SCS
functional can reproduce the experimentally obtained lattice structure
of bulk PdSe2, because it provides an appropriate description
of interlayer interaction. Multilayer PdSe2 sheets were
all found to be indirect bandgap semiconductors. Interestingly, we
identified convergence in energy of both the conduction and valence
bands in monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer PdSe2, indicative
of their excellent thermoelectric properties.

Results and Discussion
Structural
and Electronic Properties of Bulk PdSe2
It is
well known that van der Waals (vdW) interaction plays
a dominant role in layered materials like graphite and hexagonal boron
nitride.34 Thus, accurate theoretical description
of the interlayer interaction is of great importance in the investigation
of physical properties of layered materials. Herein, the structural
properties of bulk PdSe2 are studied using 13 different
DFT functionals, including PBE,28 PBE-D2,35 PBE-D3 with zero damping (PBE-D3 + ZP),36 PBE-D3 with Becke Johnson damping (PBE-D3 +
BJ),36,37 PBE-dDsC,38,39 optPBE,40 optB86b,40 optB88,40 vdW-DF2,41 PBE-TS,42 PBE-TS + HI,43,44 PBE-TS + SCS,45 and PBE-TS + MBD45,46 functionals. Figure 1a shows the atomic
structure of bulk PdSe2; it has an orthorhombic structure
with a Pbca space group. The experimental
lattice parameters of the crystal are a = 5.7457
Å, b = 5.8679 Å, and c = 7.6976 Å.47 Our computed lattice
parameters of bulk PdSe2 are summarized in Table 1 and are compared with the available
experimental data. Obviously, the PBE functional cannot describe the
interlayer interaction in bulk PdSe2 because it cannot
reproduce the c lattice constant accurately. Meanwhile,
the PBE-D2, PBE-D3 + ZP, PBE-D3 + BJ, and PBE-dDsC functionals makeover
binding results and underestimate the interlayer spacing in comparison
with experimental data. These functionals predict the c lattice constants to be 6.173–6.201, ∼1.5 Å smaller
than the experimental value. They also predict larger a and b lattice constants compared with the experimental
data.47 vdW-DF functionals, including optPBE,
optB86b, optB88, and vdW-DF2 series methods, also fail to predict
the lattice structure of bulk PdSe2. The calculated values
of the c lattice constants (6.303, 6.212, 6.258,
and 6.524 Å, respectively) are significantly smaller than the
experimental data.47 Interestingly, the
PBE-TS series functionals result in a significantly better agreement
with the experimental data than other methods. Specifically, for the
computed values obtained by PBE-TS + SCS, the mean relative errors
with respect to the experimental data are only 1.83, 1.34, and −0.05%
for the lattice constants a, b,
and c, respectively. In theory,48 PBE-D2 is based on an empirical correction to the total
energy in the form of a pairwise interaction, whereas optB86b and
vdW-DF2 are based solely on the global charge density. On the other
hand, the TS approaches refine these basic corrections with an improved
description of the nonlocal effect. On the basis of the above discussion,
it is found that the PBE-TS + SCS functional leads to a reasonable
and accurate prediction of the lattice parameters of bulk PdSe2.

Next, we focus on the electronic properties of bulk PdSe2. Its Brillouin zone and electronic band structure are shown in Figure 1b,c, respectively.
Bulk PdSe2 is metallic in nature with many bands across
the Fermi level (Figure 1c). We also calculated the band structure of bulk PdSe2 in the presence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) (Figure S1). Both combinations of methods predict
that bulk PdSe2 is metallic, being fully consistent with
the recently reported experimental results.33 Clearly, accurate prediction of the lattice structure is vital for
the theoretical prediction of the electronic properties.

Lattice Structure
and Electronic Properties of Monolayer PdSe2
Next,
we focus on monolayer PdSe2. Figure 2a shows the optimized
structure of the PdSe2 monolayer: every primitive cell
of monolayer PdSe2 contains two Pd atoms and four Se atoms
in a pentagonal arrangement. Unlike the isotropic penta-graphene,26 PdSe2 has an anisotropic structure.
The optimized lattice constants are a = 5.71 Å
and b = 5.90 Å, which are in good agreement
with the previous results.33,49 In a primitive cell,
each Pd atom forms four bonds with four Se atoms, while each Se atom
forms two bonds with two Pd atoms and one bond with another Se atom.
Because of its anisotropy, two types of Se are defined in a primitive
cell, denoted as Se1 and Se2 (Figure 2a). The bond lengths of Pd–Se1, Pd–Se2, and Se1–Se2 are 2.45, 2.46, and 2.42 Å, respectively, while the
bond angles of Se1–Pd–Se1, Se1–Pd–Se2, and Pd–Se1–Pd are 93.6, 86.4, and 113.7°, respectively. The side
view (Figure 2a) shows
a large buckling height of 0.75 Å, much larger than that of penta-graphene
(0.6 Å).26

Figure 2 (a) Top view (top panel)
and side view (bottom panel) of the monolayer
PdSe2. The red and white spheres represent Pd and Se atoms,
respectively. (b) The electronic band structure and density of states
(DOSs) of monolayer PdSe2 are calculated by the PBE-TS
+ SCS method. The Fermi level has been set to zero and indicated by
the dashed line. (c) The Brillouin zone path of PdSe2 primitive
cell.

The band structure and density
of states (DOSs) of the monolayer
PdSe2 are shown in Figure 2b. It can be found that the PdSe2 monolayer
is an indirect bandgap semiconductor. Interestingly, the conduction
band minimum (CBM) is not located along the high symmetry lines like
other 2D semiconducting materials such as MoS250 and phosphorene.51 It is located at the Λ point, which is along the Γ and M (0.385, 0.5, 0) lines (Figure 2c). Meanwhile, the valence band maximum (VBM)
is located at the Γ–X line, marked as
∑. The bandgap calculated by PBE-TS + SCS is 1.381 eV, which
is slightly larger than the value (1.3 eV) reported by Oyedele et
al.33 In general, this difference is due
to the large uncertainty in the prediction of an unoccupied band by
commonly used exchange–correlation functional.52 Since both Pd and Se are heavy elements, the band structure
of the PdSe2 monolayer was checked by considering SOC (Figure S2). The spin–orbit splitting of
the conduction band around the S point is ∼28
meV; however, no significant spin–orbit splitting appears at
the CBM and VBM. The PBE-TS + SCS + SOC method yields a bandgap of
1.376 eV, similar to that predicted by the PBE-TS + SCS method. We
also calculated the band structure of the PdSe2 monolayer
by HSE06 functional (Figure S2b).53 The HSE06 gap (2.203 eV) is much larger than
that obtained by the PBE-TS + SCS method. Moreover, the band structure
predicted by the PBE-TS + SCS + HSE06 method has a profile similar
to the PBE-TS + SCS result. Thus, the PBE-TS + SCS method is reliable
for predicting the electronic properties of PdSe2 layers.

Structural and Electronic Properties of Few-Layer PdSe2 Stacks
Next, we investigated the structural and electronic
properties of bilayer PdSe2. Figure 3a shows that the first possible stacking
pattern of bilayer PdSe2 is named α-PdSe2 (AB stacking), which starts from the bulk stacking sequence, and
the structure symmetry is C2v. Due to C2v symmetry,
one PdSe2 layer can rotate 180° with respect to the
adjacent layer, to yield the other possible stacking pattern, β-PdSe2, which has a lower symmetry of C2h. The transverse displacement between the two adjacent
layers is considered to search for the most stable stacking pattern.
The translational degree of freedom was obtained by varying [Δx, Δy] in the range of [0, a] and [0, b], respectively, with a 20
× 20 grid. At each grid point, all atoms were allowed to relax.
The energetically favorable bilayer PdSe2 stacking was
assessed using the potential energy surface (PES) as a function of
the relative position between the two sheets (Figure 3c,d). The minimum relative energy was obtained
at a relative shift [Δx, Δy] = [0.00, 0.00] for α-PdSe2 and [0.00, 0.15] for
β-PdSe2. The corresponding structures are shown in Figure 3e,f. α-PdSe2 has lower energy than β-PdSe2. However,
the energy difference is only 10.85 meV for the studied supercell,
corresponding to 0.90 meV/atom. The resulting interlayer spacing is
3.95 and 4.07 Å, respectively, indicating the presence of vdW
interaction between the adjacent PdSe2 layers. Interestingly,
after forming the bilayer structure, charge is redistributed in the
region between the layers, thereby changing the covalent bonds within
each layer. Consequently, the lattice parameters of bilayer PdSe2 significantly increased: the lattice parameter a increased by 0.05 Å on moving from monolayer to bilayer, with
the corresponding increase in the lattice parameter b being 0.02 Å.

Pd and Se atoms, respectively.

PES plot of β-PdSe2. The energy values in the PES
plot are relative and in the unit of eV. (e) The lowest energy structure
of α-PdSe2. (f) The lowest energy structure of β-PdSe2.

Next, to evaluate the binding
strength, we calculated the interlayer
binding energy (Eb), defined as the atom-averaged
energy difference between the separated layers and bound layers, and
is given as the following equation 1  where Eb is the
interlayer binding energy (meV/atom), Emonolayer is the energy of a PdSe2 monolayer, Ebilayer is the total energy of the bilayer, and Natom is the number of atoms per layer. According
to this definition, a larger absolute value of Eb implies a more stable stacking phase. The Eb for α-PdSe2 and β-PdSe2 are 62.04 and 61.14 meV/atom, respectively, corresponding to 0.3498
and 0.3447 J/m2. These values are even smaller than that
in graphite (0.37 J/m2).46 That
is why PdSe2 can be easily exfoliated from its bulk crystals.

Here, the well-studied graphite is considered for comparison to
estimate the natural abundance of different stacking patterns of PdSe2.54,55 There are two phases of graphite in nature:
AB and ABC stacking, with the Eb of AB-graphite
(55.15 meV/atom) being only 0.35 meV/atom larger than the ABC-graphite
(54.80 meV/atom).55 As a matter of fact,
the natural abundance of AB-graphite is ∼80%.56 Here, the Eb of α-PdSe2 is higher than its β counterpart by up to 0.90 meV/atom,
which is much higher than that in graphite, indicating that α-PdSe2 plays a dominant role in bilayer PdSe2.47,57

Figure 4 shows Eb as a function of interlayer distance. Only
the results of α-PdSe2 are shown because it is energetically
most stable. The distance–energy points can be fitted to the
empirical potentials within the Buckingham potential58 and the Lenard-Jones (LJ) potential59 2   3  In 2 and 3, A, B, C, ε, and σ are the fitting parameters. A nonlinear
fitting
process yields A = −3.301 eV, B = 0.479 Å–1, and C = 5.261 × 102 meVÅ6 for the Buckingham
potential, and ε = 0.4016 meV and σ = 2.957 Å for
the LJ potential.

of the
interlayer distance. The symbols were obtained by DFT calculations.
The solid line represents the fitting curve based on the Buckingham
potential.

The band structures of the PdSe2 bilayer with α
and β phases (Figure 5) show that they are also indirect bandgap semiconductors
like monolayer PdSe2. However, due to the quantum confinement
effect, the bandgap reduces to 0.832 and 0.847 eV for α-PdSe2 and β-PdSe2, respectively. We also computed
the band structures of PdSe2 bilayers using the PBE-TS
+ SCS + SOC method. Figure S3 shows no
significant spin–orbit splitting at either CBM or VBM for bilayer
PdSe2, similar to monolayer PdSe2.

+ SCS method. The Fermi level has been set to zero and indicated by
the dashed line.

Next, we present the
structural and electronic properties of few-layer
PdSe2 with the number of layers up to five. All these multilayer
systems prefer the AB stacking pattern, similar to the bilayer one. Figure 6a–c shows
the band structures of the PdSe2 trilayer, tetralayer,
and pentalayer, respectively. Generally, the CBM of these multilayer
systems are always located at the Λ point along the Γ–M line. However, the VBM is initially located at the ∑
point along the Γ–X line, and then shifts
to the Γ point upon increasing the number of layers to four,
as shown in Figure 6d. These multilayer systems always retain the indirect bandgap semiconducting
behavior. SOC has a slight effect on the band profile at both the
conduction and valence edges (Figure S4).

Convergence in Energy of
Band Edge
On the basis of
the band structure of multilayer PdSe2, we would like to
emphasize its promise in thermoelectric applications. In thermoelectric
effect, the efficiency of its thermal-to-electric energy conversion
is usually evaluated in terms of a dimensionless figure of merit ZT, given by the following equation 4  where S, σ, T, and κ are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity,
operating temperature, and thermal conductivity, respectively. For
a real material with multiple sub-bands, if each conduction valley
can be treated as noninteracting, the entire transport coefficient
in a band can be summed from those of the constituent conduction valleys
by assuming a parallel conductor model 5  On the basis of this model, both the two valleys
have contribution to the total electrical conductivity while the total
Seebeck coefficient remains unchanged. Therefore, the power factor, P = S2σ, significantly
increased. This concept of band convergence has been applied to control
the valley degeneracy in PbTe1–xSex alloys,60 Mg2Si1–xSnx solid solutions,61 MoS2,62−64 and phosphorene,65 to
improve their thermoelectric performance. For example, Hong et al.62 predicted that ZT of MoS2 can be greatly enhanced by tuning the thickness because the
valley degeneracy leads to a significant enhancement in electrical
conductivity, while the Seebeck coefficient vanishes. The PdSe2 monolayer is a potential high-performance thermoelectric
material because of its reported high Seebeck coefficients (>200
μV/K).66 Furthermore, convergence
of electronic bands
also occurs in monolayer and few-layer PdSe2, as schematically
shown in Figure 7.
For the PdSe2 monolayer, in addition to the CBM at the
Λ point, there is another valley in the conduction band (CBM
+ 1) at the Λ + 1 point along the S–Y high symmetry line (Figures 2c and 7). The bottom
of this valley is only 29 meV (PBE-TS + SCS calculation) higher in
energy than that in Λ valley (Table 2), which is smaller than 52 meV (2 times
the thermal energy at room temperature, denoted hereafter as 2kBT300K). By employing
PBE-TS + SCS + SOC calculation, the energy difference is decreased
to 16 meV (Table 2).
The SOC splitting of the conduction band at the Λ + 1 point
is only 28 meV (Figure S2a); thus, also
highly likely to make contribution to the electrical conductivity.
Interestingly, in addition to the VBM at the ∑ point along
the Γ–X high symmetry line, there is
another valley in the valence band (VBM – 1) at the ∑
– 1 point along the Y–Γ high
symmetry line (Figures 2c and 7a). The energy difference between these
two valleys is only 36 meV (Table 2), which is also smaller than 2kBT300K. For the α-PdSe2 bilayer, the energy difference between CBM and CBM + 1 increases
to 49 meV, which is smaller than 2kBT300K, similar to the monolayer (Table 2). This indicates that the thermoelectric
transport occurs through both the CBM and CBM + 1 valleys. Furthermore,
there is another valley in the valence band at the Γ point (Figures 5a and 7b), the top of this valley is 23 meV lower in energy than
that in the ∑ valley (Table 2). Therefore, both the ∑ and Γ valleys
contribute to the electrical conductivity. For the β-PdSe2 bilayer, energy difference between the CBM and CBM + 1 is
35 meV, while the energy difference between the VBM and VBM –
1 is 21 meV (Table 2). Both these values are smaller than those in α-PdSe2. For the PdSe2 trilayer, the energy difference between
the VBM and VBM – 1 is only 8 meV (Table 2). However, the energy difference between
the CBM and CBM + 1 is 55 meV (Table 2), which is larger than 2kBT300K, suggesting that thermoelectric
transport occurs only through the Λ valley. Finally, for the
PdSe2 tetralayer and pentalayer, the energy differences
between the CBM and CBM + 1 are always larger than 2kBT300K, while the VBM occurs
at the Γ point and the valley degeneracy vanishes (Table 2).

To justify theoretical analysis, next, based
on the band structure
obtained from DFT, we further use the Boltzmann transport equation
within constant relaxation time approximation to calculate different
transport properties, i.e., Seebeck coefficient S, electrical conductivity σ, and power factor P, as follows67 6   7   8  Here, e is the charge of
the carrier, T is the temperature, EK is the electron energy, τ is the relaxation time, m* is the effective mass of the charge carrier, μ
is the electron chemical potential, and D(EK) is the DOS. As acoustic phonon scattering
is the dominant scattering mechanism for carrier relaxation time in
the low energy region, Qin et al.49 calculated
the electron/hole relaxation time of monolayer PdSe2 by
the deformation potential theory, which is 2.73 × 10–14 s for electron. Here, we adopted this value and used m* as 0.19me in our calculation.49 The carrier concentration (n) is defined as 9  Here, rigid-band approximation68 is used,
which assumes that the shape of the
band structure does not change under light doping, but only shifts
the Fermi level up (down) for n-type (p-type) doping, respectively.

First, the transport properties of n-type monolayer PdSe2 as a function of n are shown in Figure S5. It is clear that σ increases with the increase
in n, whereas the Seebeck coefficient S decreases with the increase in the carrier concentration, which
is in good agreement with the previous report.66 Therefore, there is an optimal carrier concentration nMax (∼1.5 × 1012 cm–2) yielding the maximum attainable value of power factor PMax. The dependence of transport properties
on carrier concentration is similar to those observed in other nanoscale
thermoelectric materials.69,70

Next, using the
n-type α-PdSe2 bilayer as an example,
we explore the importance of valley degeneracy on thermoelectric performance.
The conduction band of the α-PdSe2 bilayer is shown
in Figure 8a, where
the CBM and the CBM + 1 bands are highlighted in red and blue, respectively.
The energy difference between the CBM and the CBM + 1 (ΔCBM) is 49 meV (Table 2). Then, we artificially changed the ΔCBM to 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 meV and calculated the partial density
of states (PDOSs), which are shown in Figure S6. Because there is no report about the electron relaxation time of
bilayer PdSe2, we focus on the related change of the maximum
attainable P as a function of ΔCBM. The ratio R is defined as R = P(ΔCBM)/P(ΔCBM = 10 meV), where P(ΔCBM) is the maximum attainable power factor of the considered case and P(Δ = 10 meV) is the maximum attainable power factor
for the sample with Δ = 10 meV. It is clear that the ΔCBM significantly affects the P value of the
α-PdSe2 bilayer. As the ΔCBM increases, P gradually decreases, owing to the low valley degeneracy.
The maximum attainable power factor for a system with ΔCBM = 90 meV is only 62% of that with ΔCBM = 10 meV, emphasizing the importance of valley degeneracy on thermoelectric
performance.

Conclusions
In
summary, we systemically investigated the structural and electronic
properties of multilayer PdSe2 using vdW-corrected DFT
computations. We first employed 13 different vdW-correction methods
to predict the accurate geometric and electronic structures of bulk
PdSe2. The overall accuracies for different correction
methods are compared and the PBE-TS + SCS functional is found to exhibit
the best performance. Accurate prediction of the lattice parameters
is vital for theoretical prediction of the electronic properties of
bulk PdSe2. The metallic properties in bulk are in good
agreement with the reported experimental data. On the other hand,
monolayer PdSe2 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with
a bandgap of 1.381 eV. For bilayer PdSe2, we search possible
stacking patterns using a systematic study of the potential energy
surface. The minimum potential corresponds to the AB stacking pattern.
The interlayer interaction between the two separate layers induced
a significantly reduced bandgap of 0.832 eV, which can be further
reduced to 0.308 eV by increasing the number of layers to five. Interestingly,
valley convergence is found in the band structures of monolayer, bilayer,
and trilayer PdSe2, leading to a significant improvement
in thermoelectric performance. Our results denote that few-layer PdSe2 is a new category of promising material for future nanoelectronic
and thermoelectric applications.

Computational Methods
The calculations were performed by using the projector-augmented
plane-wave method71 within the DFT framework
in the code of Vienna ab initio simulation package.72,73 Calculations were conducted with a Monkhorst–Pack74k-point mesh of 10 × 10
× 1 and a cut-off energy of 350 eV, which provide good convergence.
A vacuum region larger than 15 Å was used to eliminate the interaction
between the adjacent periodic images in the study of few-layer PdSe2. In geometry optimization, atomic coordinates were relaxed
until the maximum atomic force became smaller than 0.01 eV/Å.
