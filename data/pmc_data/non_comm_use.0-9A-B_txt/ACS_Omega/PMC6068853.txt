In this work, we report the interaction
of a fluorescent ZnO–Au
nanocomposite with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to AT-specific
DNA interaction, which is hitherto not known. For this study, three
natural double-stranded (ds) DNAs having different AT:GC compositions
were chosen and a ZnO–Au nanocomposite has been synthesized
by anchoring a glutathione-protected gold nanocluster on the surface
of egg-shell-membrane (ESM)-based ZnO nanoparticles. The ESM-based
bare ZnO nanoparticles did not show any selective interaction toward
DNA, whereas intrinsic fluorescence of the ZnO–Au nanocomposite
shows an appreciable blue shift (Δλmax = 18
nm) in the luminescence wavelength of 520 nm in the presence of ds
calf thymus (CT) DNA over other studied DNAs. In addition, the interaction
of the nanocomposite through fluorescence studies with single-stranded
(ss) CT DNA, synthetic polynucleotides, and nucleobases/nucleotides
(adenine, thymine, deoxythymidine monophosphate, deoxyadenosine monophosphate)
was also undertaken to delineate the specificity in interaction. A
minor blue shift (Δλmax = 5 nm) in the emission
wavelength at 520 nm was observed for single-stranded CT DNA, suggesting
the proficiency of the nanocomposite for discriminating ss and ds
CT DNA. More importantly, fluorescence signals from the nano-bio-interaction
could be measured directly without any modification of the target,
which is the foremost advantage emanated from this study compared
with other previous reports. The AT base-pair-induced enhancement
was also found to be highest for the melting temperature of CT DNA
(ΔTmCT = 6.7 °C). Furthermore,
spectropolarimetric experiments followed by calorimetric analysis
provided evidence for specificity in AT-rich DNA interaction. This
study would lead to establish the fluorescent ZnO–Au nanocomposite
as a probe for nanomaterial-based DNA-binding study, featuring its
specific interaction toward AT-rich DNA.

Introduction
The interaction between
engineered nanoparticles (NPs) and biomolecules
has led to the development of new type of biosensors1,2 and biomolecular targets.3,4 To explore the fundamental5,6 and technological7 aspects of nano-bio-interaction,
a broad range of inorganic,8,9 organic,10 and hybrid nanostructures11 or nanocomposites12,13 exhibiting well-defined
structural, optical, electrical, and magnetic properties have been
targeted by many investigators. Among these, metal–semiconductor
nanocomposites possessing synergy between different components are
also being projected as a new class of materials for this purpose.14,15 There are several reports on ZnO-based DNA sensors using thiol-oligonucleotide
or fluorophore-labeled target DNA and related perspectives of their
interaction.16−20 Among the metal nanoparticles, Au has been considered as a classical
material because of its novel optical properties arising out of plasmonic
resonance, biocompatibility, and above all availability of facile
synthesis procedures for achieving controlled particle size distribution
compared to other noble metal nanoparticles.21−27 Simultaneously, ZnO–Au composites have also been explored
by many; for example, Purwidyantri et al. demonstrated Au NP-decorated
zinc oxide as a platform for bacterial DNA hybridization.28 Singhal et al. reported the electrochemical
performance of zinc oxide/platinum–palladium (ZnO/Pt–Pd)
with DNA.29 Perumal et al. developed a
detection strategy for DNA from pathogenic leptospirosis with a gold-seeded
ZnO nanoflower.30 Foo et al. described
a Au-decorated ZnO thin-film-based biosensor using a thiol-modified
single-stranded (ss) DNA probe.31 However,
all of these electrochemical methods involve an additional reducing/oxidizing
agent, which makes the detection more complicated. In contrast, optical
detection, namely, the fluorescence-based method, offers high sensitivity
toward specific molecular recognition with a rapid response and easy
operating technique.32 Recently, resonance
Raman scattering has also been used for a specific DNA target sequence.33 Apart from gold nanoparticles, gold nanoclusters
(Au NCs) also exhibit size-dependent strong fluorescence property,
photostability, and functionality for bioconjugation.34−36 Hence, several current studies focus on developing fluorescent probes
using gold nanoclusters, such as, a label-free sensor has been developed
by Wang’s group using gold nanoclusters (Au NCs).37 Several theoretical studies also support the
strong interaction of Au NCs with nucleobases.38−42 From the data available in the literature, distinguished
affinity of gold nanoclusters toward nucleobases is evident.

In the past, we have carried out extensive work in understanding
the interaction of various nanostructures like carbon spindles,10 silver nanoparticles,8 and ZnO nanoparticles43 with DNA. In
one of our recent studies, the interaction of fluorescent ZnO rods
with DNA, which incidentally resulted in Escherichia
coli (EC) DNA-specific interaction leading to white
light emission, has been reported.9 Inspired
by this result and motivated by the affinity of gold nanocluster toward
oligonucleotides,38−42 we have extended our research with fluorescent nanocomposites to
understand the synergistic effect of two fluorescent materials in
a single nanocomposite to find out if there could be base-pair-specific
interaction with such composites. For this purpose, we have chosen
two individual fluorescent materials, ZnO nanoparticles, exhibiting
emission at 389 and 513 nm, and gold nanoclusters, exhibiting emission
at 610 nm. Here, we present a fluorescent ZnO–Au nanocomposite
exhibiting dual emission at ∼390 and 520 nm as a probe for
elucidating DNA interaction and specificity. Highly monodispersed
glutathione (a natural thiol-containing tripeptide)-protected fluorescent
gold nanoclusters (G-Au NCs) were synthesized via a facile synthetic
method, followed by their deposition onto preformed egg-shell-membrane
(ESM)-based ZnO nanoparticles. A rigorous characterization of the
nanocomposite was carried out prior to investigating the nano-bio-interaction.
Three natural DNAs, calf thymus (CT), E. coli (EC), and Micrococcus lysodeikticus (ML) DNAs, having different AT:GC compositions were chosen for this
study. A noticeable change in the fluorescence of the synthesized
nanocomposite in the presence of CT DNA indicates its strong interaction,
which can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the synthesized
nanocomposite derived from the unique combination of G-Au NCs and
ZnO nanoparticles. Furthermore, thorough investigation was also carried
out to understand the fundamental aspects of binding that can explain
the differences in binding efficiency to different DNAs.

Results and Discussion
Carboxylic groups are the commonly employed functional groups for
anchoring plasmonic materials onto the ZnO surface.44 Thus, following this, here, we have also used glutathione-protected
Au NCs with carboxylic acid groups for forming a composite with ZnO
nanoparticles. A schematic of the synthesis procedure is shown in Figure 1. Disappearance of
the absorption spectra of bare G-Au NCs from the supernatant of the
resultant ZnO–Au nanocomposite after centrifugation confirms
the complete anchoring of G-Au NCs onto ZnO nanoparticles and the
successful formation of the nanocomposite.Figure 1 Synthesis of the AZO
nanocomposite is shown as a schematic representation.



To gain insight into the crystalline nature
of gold nanoclusters
(G-Au NCs), ESM-based native ZnO (ZO) nanoparticles, and ZnO–Au
(AZO) nanocomposites, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study was performed
as presented in Figure 2. It is very difficult to acquire strong reflections in the XRD pattern
for nanoclusters. Recently, Wu et al. studied the crystal structure
of glutathione-capped gold nanoclusters through XRD measurements and
reported two broad reflections with 2θ at around 37.5 and 66.5°,
respectively.45 But, here, we have observed
only one broad diffraction peak at 33.03° with a weak intensity
for G-Au NCs. The XRD pattern of bare ZO nanoparticles is in good
accordance with that of the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO lattice reported
elsewhere.46 Furthermore, besides the diffraction
peaks of ZnO, the diffraction peaks of gold nanoclusters are not observed
in the composite because of their negligible intensity.47

(ZO) NPs,
and ZnO–Au nanocomposite (AZO).

Figure 3a–f
depicts the representative bright field transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of native ZO nanoparticles, as-synthesized G-Au NCs,
and the binary AZO nanocomposite with monodispersed G-Au NCs, respectively,
at low (Figure 3a,b,d)
and high magnifications (Figure 3c,e,f). Figure 3g–i represents the corresponding high-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) images. The bright field image presented in Figure 3a reveals the formation of
almost spherical ZnO nanoparticles with an average size of 30–40
nm using ESM as a biotemplate. Figure 3b,c represents the as-synthesized gold nanoclusters
with an average size of 1.8 nm. Figure 3d–f clearly demonstrates the formation of a
binary AZO nanocomposite, depicting uniform distribution of very small
gold nanoclusters onto ZnO nanoparticles. The light contrast particles
are ZnO nanoparticles, and the dark particles are G-Au NCs. In addition,
bright field images of the AZO nanocomposite also confirm the well-anchored
G-Au NCs on the surfaces of ZnO and it is hard to observe individual
ZO nanoparticles or G-Au NCs, which signifies the successful integration
of the G-Au NCs on the ZO nanoparticles. Importantly, the average
size of G-Au NCs (∼1.8 ± 0.04 nm) was well preserved in
our system, as evident from Figure 3c,f. Interestingly, the HRTEM image of native ZnO (Figure 3g), which shows the
lattice fringes of 0.281 nm d-spacing corresponding
to the (100) lattice plane, becomes faint with the presence of very
small G-Au NCs in the nanocomposite (Figure 3h,i), confirming the co-existence of ZnO
and G-Au NCs.

respectively.

To clarify the presence
of anchoring sites within the composite,
the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) study of the pure glutathione
(G) ligand, G-Au NCs, ZO nanoparticles, and the AZO nanocomposite
was carried out as shown in Figure 4. The FT-IR spectrum of ZO shows a stretching band
at approximately 436 cm–1 due to the vibration of
Zn–O bonds.48 The band identified
at around 1630 cm–1 is attributed to the bending
vibration of the H–O–H group of chemisorbed water, and
the broad band at 3000–3650 cm–1 is reasonable
to confirm the adsorption of water molecules.49 The stretching Zn–O band at 436 cm–1 (as
observed in bare ZnO) shifted to 428 cm–1 in the
AZO nanocomposite. On the other hand, in comparison in the spectrum
of pure glutathione ligand, the characteristic peak related to the
S–H stretching vibration at 2524 cm–1 was
not found in the spectrum of G-Au NC within the detection limit, whereas
the other peaks at 3353 and 1714 cm–1 that stem
from −NH2 and the −C=O stretching
vibration modes, originating from glutathione ligands, and the weak
band at 1456 cm–1 peak arising from CH2–S methylene scissoring (δ) were also observed.50,51 This confirms the disappearance of S–H bonds and the formation
of the S–Au chemical bond in the synthesized gold nanoclusters.
However, the nature of the characteristic bands in the G-Au NC and
AZO nanocomposite is slightly different from that of the original
ligand with low intensity. The characteristic peaks observed at 2925,
3257, and 3443 cm–1 in the AZO nanocomposite are
responsible for C–H, N–H, and O–H stretching
frequencies, respectively.47

ZnO–Au nanocomposite (AZO), and native ZnO (ZO).

The recorded absorption spectra of ZnO nanoparticles,
G-Au NCs,
and ZnO–Au nanocomposite in the 250–800 nm range are
presented in Figure 5a. The pure gold nanocluster has a characteristic shoulder peak at
391 nm, which is consistent with Au(0)@Au(I)–thiolate structures,
as discussed earlier by Xie’s group.52 The absence of absorption band at around >500 nm for Au–thiolate
NCs indicates that the obtained G-Au NCs are distinctly different
from the conventional plasmonic gold nanoclusters.53,54 ZnO nanoparticles exhibit a threshold (band gap) in the UV region
of 376 nm (3.29 eV), which is attributed to the excitonic absorption
of ZnO. The absorption profile of ZnO in the nanocomposite is significantly
red-shifted compared to that of bare ZnO, with an onset at 383 nm
(3.23 eV).

Figure 5 (a) Recorded UV–visible and (b) emission spectra of native
ZnO (ZO) NPs (λex = 345 nm), ZnO–Au (AZO)
nanocomposite (λex = 345 nm), and gold nanocluster
(G-Au NC) (λex = 420 nm).

Figure 5b
illustrates
the steady-state emission spectra of bare ZO nanoparticles, G-Au NCs,
and AZO nanocomposites. As we have reported earlier, under excitation
at 345 nm, ZnO nanoparticles exhibit two emission bands: a narrow
near-band-edge (NBE) emission in the UV region with a maximum at ∼389
nm owing to the direct radiative recombination of excitons and a broad
emission in the visible zone with a maximum at ∼513 nm corresponding
to the oxygen-vacancy-related surface defects.46,55 On the other hand, G-Au NCs show a strong luminescence property
with an emission maximum at ∼610 nm on excitation at 420 nm.56 A large Stokes (λemi –
λabs ∼ 190 nm) shift in the emission is consistent
with the aggregation-induced emission of Au(I)–thiolate complexes
on the Au(0) surface, as demonstrated by Xie’s group.52 A digital image as in Figure S1 demonstrates the strong red emission of G-Au NCs under UV
light (λ365 nm) exposure. This emissive property
undoubtedly distinguishes the ultra-small G-Au NCs from the larger
plasmonic Au nanoparticles. Emission spectra of the resultant nanocomposite
(AZO) show the NBE emission at ∼390 nm and the surface-defect-related
broad emission in the 450–720 nm region, as shown in Figure 5b. Interestingly,
it was observed that in the nanocomposite the spectral intensity of
the surface-defect-related emission was significantly reduced with
extended spectral span. The multidentate anchoring ability of the
glutathione ligand enables G-Au NCs to bind to the defect present
in the ZnO surface, which may induce extended spectral span toward
longer wavelength in the resultant nanocomposite.

DNA-Binding Studies
The usual biophysical techniques
are implemented to investigate the interaction of AZO with DNA. As
discussed earlier, the ZnO–Au nanocomposite displays a characteristic
absorption band at ∼383 nm. The interaction of the nanocomposite
with CT, EC, and ML DNAs was monitored in the 250–800 nm region,
as shown in Figure S2. The concentration
of DNA solution used was in the range of 0.1–0.7 μM.
As evident from Figure S2, with the increasing
concentration of CT DNA, there is a gradual decrease in absorbance
without any shift of the absorption band of the nanocomposite. This
gradual decrease in absorbance was observed in all of the studied
DNAs. The absorption spectrum of the nanocomposite exhibited 12.6,
14.28, and 14.61% decrease in the absorbance band at ∼383 nm
upon incremental addition of CT, EC, and ML DNA, respectively.

In the recent past, fluorescence spectroscopy became a well-accepted
tool to monitor the binding kinetics of DNA–NP interactions.9,43,57 Initially, we have studied the
interaction of native ZnO nanoparticles with the aforementioned three
DNAs. With the addition of all of the DNAs, irrespective of the AT:GC
composition, quenching of the surface defect peak maximum at around
513 nm of the bare ZO nanoparticles was observed, as evident from Figure S3. The observed spectral changes for
all of the DNA–ZnO titrations were same. Recent computational
studies of ZnO with DNA/RNA assigned the fluorescence quenching to
the nano-bio-interaction at the defect level.58 However, here, bare ZnO could not selectively interact with DNAs.
Therefore, in this work, the luminescence property of the ZnO–Au
nanocomposite was chosen to explore the interaction with different
DNAs. For this purpose, the ZnO–Au nanocomposite was titrated
with CT, EC, and ML DNAs, respectively, and emission spectra were
monitored as presented in Figure 6. For better data comparison, all of the emission spectra
have been normalized with respect to band edge emission at ∼390
nm. Such a plot helps in monitoring the actual change of the surface-defect-related
peak with varying DNA concentrations. Figure 6a shows a marginal change in the intensity
of the emission band, at ∼520 nm, of the nanocomposite upon
addition of CT DNA at the initial stage of the interaction. However,
further addition of CT DNA elicited a continuous reduction in the
intensity of the emission maximum at ∼520 nm along with a blue
shift of ∼18 nm at the saturation level. This was indicative
of a strong binding of the ZnO–Au nanocomposite with CT DNA.
Spectroscopic titration with EC DNA (Figure 6b) also reduced the emission intensity with
a blue shift of ∼10 nm under the same experimental conditions.
The decrease in the emission intensity in above cases can also be
due to the microenvironmental variation in the nanocomposite–DNA
complex system. In contrast, in the case of ML DNA titration (Figure 6c), the shift in
the emission maximum at ∼520 nm was only ∼3 nm, i.e.,
only a minor shift was noticed. It is clear that CT DNA containing
42% GC + 58% AT showed a maximum shift in the emission maximum at
∼520 nm and EC DNA containing 50% GC + 50% AT showed a closely
similar change, whereas ML DNA containing 72% GC + 28% AT did not
exhibit any significant change. However, this change is markedly different
from that in our previous reports on the studies of fluorescent ZnO43 and carbon spindles10 with DNA, thereby suggesting a distinctly different binding pathway
compare to the former. The fluorescence spectral changes of this nature
though small are sufficient for providing good binding analysis, as
already demonstrated by earlier groups.59,60 The base composition
of DNA has been found to strongly influence the spectral nature of
the nanocomposite emission by altering the relative intensity of the
emission maximum at ∼520 nm with significant shifts in the
peak position. The signature of the AT:GC composition of DNA on the
shift in the emission band can be distinctly visualized from Figure 6d. The inset of Figure 6d typically displays
the Commission Internationale de Ľeclairage (CIE) 1931 diagram
exhibiting the shift in the emission wavelength as a function of DNA
composition. The CIE co-ordinates were found to be (0.32, 0.40), (0.29,
0.36), (0.30, 0.38), and (0.29, 0.35) for the AZO nanocomposite, AZO-CT
DNA, AZO-EC DNA, and AZO-ML DNA, respectively. A simple variation
in the AT:GC composition essentially shifts the CIE indices. In addition,
to understand the crucial role of the gold nanoclusters in DNA interaction,
controlled experiments with only G-Au NCs were also monitored under
the same experimental conditions for a comparative purpose, as depicted
in Figure S4. There are several reports
in the literature describing the interaction between Au NCs and DNA.38−42 An experimental study by Kimura-Suda et al. investigated the adsorption
affinity of gold nanoclusters toward individual nucleobases and found
the lowest affinity for thymine.41 However,
in the present study, the red-emitting bare G-Au NCs did not show
significant variation in the activity toward all of the studied DNAs.
Hence, it can be assumed that the changes in the emission spectra
of the nanocomposite upon addition of different DNAs are attributed
to the contribution from both ZnO and G-Au NC. Accordingly, the emission
spectra of the bare nanocomposite and the nanocomposite after complexation
with all of the studied DNAs at their saturation point were deconvoluted
into two separated Gaussian components (Figure S5) with maxima at ∼520 and ∼610 nm, respectively.
It can be seen that the synergistic effect of ZnO NPs/G-Au NCs in
the AZO nanocomposite leads to specificity in DNA interaction, resulting
in a shift in the emission profile, as discussed above. It is reasonable
to evaluate the limit of detection (LOD) from the plots of F0–F of the AZO nanocomposite
versus DNA concentration, as shown in Figure S6. Here, F is the fluorescence intensity of the nanocomposite
in the presence of different concentrations of DNA and F0 is the initial fluorescence intensity in the absence
of DNA. The limit of detection (LOD) has been determined using the
standard equation involved as signal-to-noise ratio of (3σ/S), where σ is the standard deviation of the blank
and S is the slope obtained from the linear plot.
The fluorometric results confirmed the detection of CT DNA with a
linear range from 0.1 to 0.7 μM with a low detection limit of
36 nM; conversely, it was estimated to be 62 and 66 nM for EC and
ML DNAs, respectively. This outcome shows that the AZO nanocomposite
exhibited a noticeable wavelength shift on interaction with CT DNA
along with a lowest LOD value compared to that of other DNAs, as discussed
above.

(0.1–1.2 μM), respectively, and (d) variation of emission
of the AZO nanocomposite as a function of AT:GC composition; the inset
displays the observed wavelength shift in terms of CIE diagram.

We have additionally extended
our fluorometric studies with polynucleotides,
which have similar composition to natural DNAs, as shown in Figure 7. A detailed examination
reveals that initial addition of the poly(dA)·poly(dT) poly AT
pair causes a hypochromic effect of the visible emission band at ∼520
nm, followed by a blue shift in the visible emission band with a reasonable
hyperchromic effect. A remarkable shift in the emission band from
520 to 489 nm was noticed at the saturation level as a result of the
interaction of AZO with poly AT. It is to be noted that the interaction
of AZO with the poly(dG)·poly(dC) (poly GC) pair, demonstrated
in Figure 7b, did not
exhibit any significant change on the fluorescence of the nanocomposite.
The observed shift (Δλ) in the emission band at 520 nm
during the interaction of AZO with poly AT and poly GC is further
highlighted in Figure 7c. The substantial shift in the λmax (Δλ
= 31 nm) toward a shorter wavelength in the case of poly AT over poly
GC is consistent with the fluorometric results obtained with natural
DNAs. The above results demonstrate the influence of base composition
and concentration of DNA, leading to AT base pair selectivity of the
composite.

Figure 7 Fluorescence study of AZO with polynucleotides: (a) poly(dA)·poly(dT)
(poly AT) pair and (b) poly(dG)·poly(dC) (poly GC) pair and (c)
shift in the peak maximum at 520 nm after the addition of AT and GC
polynucleotides.

To establish a probable
interaction mechanism of AZO with DNA,
further studies were carried out with DNA bases/nucleosides. Because
the AT pair exhibited distinguishable emission characteristics compared
with the GC pair, as shown in Figure 7, to obtain additional insight into the affinity and
specificity of the ZnO–Au nanocomposite, similar experiments
were also carried out with nucleoside derivatives such as deoxyadenosine
monophosphate and deoxythymidine monophosphate. For each nucleoside,
the fluorescence spectra were measured, as shown in Figure S7a,b. Only in the case of deoxyadenosine monophosphate,
the shift of the emission band was recognized more precisely than
that of deoxythymidine monophosphate. This result also corroborates
the results obtained with the polynucleotides (vide supra). To extract
more valuable information, we have also performed the fluorescence
titration of the nanocomposite with different bases, viz. adenine
and thymine, and the results are shown in Figure S7c,d. Fluorescence titration data with deoxyadenosine monophosphate
and adenine were similar and quite comparable, although not identical.
Interestingly, the fluorescence spectrum was blue-shifted about 24
nm only for deoxyadenosine monophosphate titration. In other words,
it appears that the adenine base is partially responsible for the
observed blue shift in emission upon complexation. However, this shift
is not as extreme as it was found for the AT pair because of strong
binding. The strong interaction between the nanocomposite and AT pair
was found as a reflection of the noticeable wavelength shift. However,
the addition of thymine does not influence the spectral maximum at
520 nm. Although we have not specified the molecular recognition of
these interactions, it is quite reasonable that anchoring of the gold
nanocluster onto the ZnO surface accounts for the complex formation
with AT-specific DNA, which ultimately leads to strong binding.

Having sufficient information regarding the binding of ZnO–Au
nanocomposite with different double-stranded (ds) DNAs, we studied
the titration of the composite with single-stranded (ss) CT DNA. The
representative fluorescence titration profile of the AZO nanocomposite
with ss CT DNA is presented in Figure 8a. In comparison to that for ds DNA, a decrease in
the emission intensity at ∼520 nm in addition to a minor (∼5
nm) blue shift was noticed for ss CT DNA (Figure 8b). However, what is unusual about this is
that in spite of the less structural complexity of ss DNA the fluorometric
result is not as pronounced as it was found for the interaction of
ds DNA with the nanocomposite. This subtle ability of any composite
to distinguish between single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs suggests
its proficiency in DNA-binding studies. All of the results together
enable us to unequivocally establish the uniqueness of the fluorescent
ZnO–Au nanocomposite in identifying DNA specificity.

of the emission of AZO with that of ss and ds CT DNAs at a saturated
concentration of DNA.

To explore X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a tool
to
understand the binding nature of the AZO nanocomposite after interaction
with CT DNA, studies have been carried out here. The survey scan of
the AZO nanocomposite over a wide range of binding energy was acquired
initially, which had various characteristic peaks of the elements
present in the nanocomposite (Figure 9a). The wide scan spectrum of the AZO-CT DNA complex
shows the presence of phosphorous contributed from DNA. For a more
detailed analysis, highly resolved photoemission spectra are shown
in Figure 9b–d
along with fitted reliable distinction and assignment of the different
components in all of the core-level spectra. As demonstrated in Figure 9b, the binding energies
of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 of the AZO nanocomposite
are found to be 1044.7 and 1021.7 eV, respectively, manifesting the
presence of Zn2+ in the AZO nanocomposite.61 For Zn 2p, the peak positions and widths of this component
in bare AZO nanocomposite and after treatment with CT DNA strictly
remained consistent. Figure 9c also depicts the photoemission spectra of the Au 4f core
level. The binding energy of Au 4f in the AZO nanocomposite is found
to be shifted toward a lower binding energy, i.e., for 4f7/2, 83.87 eV and for 4f5/2, 87.57 eV, compared to that of
pure gold (4f7/2, 84.00 eV and 4f5/2, 87.71
eV),62 as shown in Figure 9c. Similar to the previous reports, the Au
4f7/2 spectrum was deconvoluted in the two components of
Au(I) and Au(0) with binding energies of 84.27 and 83.17 eV, respectively.53,56 However, the intensity ratio of 4f7/2 to 4f5/2 drastically changed from 1.022 to 0.710 after complexation with
CT DNA. On the other hand, the O 1s core-level spectrum (Figure 9d) reveals an asymmetric
nature, which upon deconvolution has been attributed to lattice oxygen
(OL, 530.27 eV) i.e., O2– ions on the
wurtzite structure with hexagonal Zn2+ ion array, surface
oxygen vacancy (Ov, 531.37 eV) correlated with O2– ions in the oxygen-deficient area, and chemisorbed oxygen (Oc, 531.8 eV), as shown in Figure 9d.61,63 Interestingly, the
O 1s spectrum of the AZO-CT DNA complex exhibited an apparent redistribution
between the different deconvoluted components of O 1s. Such behavior
is due to a change in the ratio of the integral area of Ov to OL from 1.18 to 0.72 and of OC to OL from 1.3 to 0.89. Indeed, the changes observed in Au 4f and
O 1s spectra clearly approve the AZO-CT DNA complex formation, which
was also evident from the fluorescence results.Figure 9 (a) Analysis of the survey

To further elucidate the mechanism
of nanocomposite–DNA
interaction, liquid FT-IR study was performed for the ZnO–Au
nanocomposite and DNA-bound nanocomposites, as shown in Figure S8. Absorption bands in the 1750–1600
cm–1 region were assigned to the in-plane vibrations
of mainly the base residues related to the stretching motions of the
C=N, C=O, and C=C bonds of the nucleic acids.64 Peaks at 1660–1665 and 1564 cm–1 are assigned to the vibration of C4=O of thymine
and amide II of the adenine moiety, respectively.65 The 1160 cm–1 band is considered to be
due to the stretching vibrations of the sugar–phosphate backbone
for B-DNA.66 A weak band at 860 cm–1 is mainly ascribed to the C–O–P–O–C
backbone vibration, which characterizes the B form of DNA.64 The bands appearing at 987 and 1080 cm–1 are due to the skeletal vibrations of ribose-phosphate and PO2– group in DNA.64 The specific peaks are either shifted, weak, or become invisible
in the case of DNA-bound nanocomposites, which collectively indicate
the possible interaction of DNA with nanocomposites. The sharp changes
in the intensity of the band at 1080 cm–1 for all
of the DNAs bound with nanocomposites confirmed that the phosphate
of DNA mainly interacts and assists the binding of nanocomposites
with DNA molecules.

Study on DNA Structure
The stabilities
of the control
DNA duplexes and the nanocomposites conjugated with duplexes were
determined by a UV thermal denaturation study by monitoring the absorbance
at 260 nm with increasing temperature, as illustrated in Figure 10. Melting data
strongly support the shifting of melting temperature of DNA (Tm) to higher values with an increase in the
percentage of GC content in the double-helix structure. The Tm values of CT, EC, and ML DNAs were 64.6, 65.5,
and 90.4 °C, respectively, (Figure 10a–c) under the conditions studied
here. After mixing with the ZnO–Au nanocomposite, the Tm values increased substantially and changed
to 71.3, 69.2, and 92.4 °C, respectively, for CT, EC, and ML
DNAs.

Figure 10 Thermal melting profile of (a) CT DNA, (b) EC DNA, and (c) ML DNA
and their complexes with AZO, respectively.

The induced maximum shift in the melting temperature of CT
DNA
(ΔTmCT = 6.7 °C) in the presence
of the nanocomposite reveals the selective thermal stabilization effect
compared to that for EC (ΔTmEC =
3.7 °C) and ML (ΔTmML = 2 °C)
DNAs under identical experimental conditions. This observed hyperchromicity
trend in thermal stability was reproducible from three independent
sets of experiments. This AT base-pair-induced enhancement in Tm further reflects the preferential binding
of the nanocomposite toward CT DNA compared to others.

The study
of conformational changes of DNA upon binding with nanomaterials
by utilizing the circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic technique is
also a unique technique for defining the nanocomposite–DNA
interaction. Figure 11 configures the CD spectrum of each DNA in citrate phosphate buffer
at pH ∼ 7.4, displaying a typical B-DNA conformation with a
major positive peak at ∼275 nm due to base stacking and a negative
peak at ∼245 nm for the helical block of the double helix,
furnishing the asymmetric domain of the bases.67 The AZO nanocomposite is not CD-responsive due to the absence
of a chiral center. The gradual addition of the nanocomposite to CT
DNA induced considerable alteration in the CD spectrum of CT DNA,
as shown in Figure 11, but the effect caused by the nanocomposite on EC and ML DNAs is
not significant. The band intensity of CT DNA at ∼275 nm was
decreased without clear shift in their position as well as in accordance
with B-DNA conformation it was remained unchanged. This variation
in the band intensity may occur due to the perturbation of the local
relative orientation of the bases to accommodate the nanocomposite,
which is required to influence the binding interaction between CT
DNA and the AZO nanocomposite. Such an observation is also consistent
with the greater selective binding affinity of the nanocomposite for
the CT DNA.

Figure 11 Subsequent changes in the CD spectra of CT, EC, and ML
DNAs on
stepwise addition of AZO (initial [DNA] = 60 μM).

Furthermore, when the CD responses obtained for
CT DNA bound to
the AZO nanocomposite (Figure S9) were
monitored as a function of temperature (20–70 °C), surprisingly,
a slight enhancement in the intensity of the band at ∼275 nm
and a diminution in the intensity of the band at ∼245 nm were
observed. This result reveals that ds CT DNA is strongly stabilized
upon its binding to the nanocomposite at higher temperatures.

To propose the probable DNA-binding mechanism of the composite,
we have considered a classical minor groove binder named Hoechst 33258,
2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-[5-(4-methylpiperazine-1-yl) benzimidazo-2-yl]
bezimidazole. The change in the emission profile of Hoechst in the
presence of CT DNA with successive addition of the AZO nanocomposite
has been presented in Figure S10. It eventually
shows a potential increment in the fluorescence intensity of the Hoechst–DNA
complex. The Hoechst displacement study supports the non-groove-binding
nature of the nanocomposite.

We also tried to quantify the efficacy
of the interactions between
the AZO nanocomposite and the selected DNA duplexes through thermodynamic
parameters. In general, non-covalent forces that direct foreign particles
and DNA binding admit electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions,
hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals forces. Short-range hydrophobic
interactions generally result in positive values of the enthalpy and
entropy change in contrast to long-range ionic-type interactions like
van der Waals forces or hydrogen bond formation, where negative values
of both the enthalpy and entropy change predominate.68 From the calorimetric titration, we have evaluated the
Gibbs energy and enthalpy of the binding association, which ultimately
enables us to quantify the change in entropy for the binding process.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) profiles for the binding of
nanocomposite under investigation with the DNA’s at 20 °C
are presented in Figure 12. The continuous lines are consistent with the best integrated
isotherm for the one-site model. All of the ITC thermograms validate
the exothermic essence of the reactions, and the outcome of the ITC
experiments is summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that ITC experiments direct the trend
in the binding constant value as follows: CT > EC > ML, being
highest
for CT DNA, which also indicates a greater binding affinity of the
nanocomposite to CT DNA over other DNAs. Interestingly, the summarized
binding data of DNAs with the composite was mainly supported by the
negative enthalpy and positive entropy contributions. The highest
binding threshold found for CT DNA was mostly entropy-driven (TΔS° = 4.22 kcal/mol) with an
enthalpy contribution of 2.76 kcal/mol.

titration of CT DNA, EC DNA, and ML DNA with
the AZO nanocomposite.

Most of the research in this area is mainly focused on the dye-labeled
DNA interaction study. We have presented a comparative study with
the established fluorescent sensors already in use in this field,
as presented in Table 2. Most of the existing fluorescent sensors for DNA detection mainly
deal with fluorescent DNA probes with well-known rapid hybridization
kinetics. However, the goal of the present investigation is mainly
aimed at a label-free DNA interaction study of fluorescent nanomaterials
that could exhibit noticeable specificity. Compared with the fluorogenic
conjugates mentioned in Table 2, the projected fluorescent ZnO–Au nanocomposite is
capable of discriminating ss and ds CT DNAs without the use of any
dye or quantum dots (QDs) in the synthesis procedure. Interestingly,
an appreciable change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the nanocomposite
with specificity indicates their selective interaction, which can
be ascribed to the mutual effect derived from the unique combination
of G-Au NCs and ZnO nanoparticles.

More importantly, fluorescence signals
arising from the nano-bio-interaction
can be measured directly without any modification of the target, which
is the foremost advantage compared to that of other previous results.
Besides these, through first-principles calculations, different groups
reported the possible way of interaction of nanomaterials and DNA.60,80−83 However, there are limited experimental research works pertaining
to the interaction of nanomaterials and DNA mainly driven by direct
binding study. To sum up, as shown in Table 3, it is found that when nanomaterials interact
with CT DNA the magnitude of binding constant (Ka) was derived to be in the order of 104–105 M–1. None of the above binding studies
have focused on the fluorescent nanocomposite derived from two individual
fluorescent nanomaterials and compared the synergistic effect of individual
fluorophore. Compared to that in the aforementioned studies, the intrinsic
fluorescence of the ZnO–Au nanocomposite shows an appreciable
blue shift in the emission maximum at ∼520 nm in the presence
of CT DNA over the other studied DNAs with comparable binding constant
values, which is more interesting compared to other results, as depicted in Table 3.

Conclusions
Here, the ZnO–Au
nanocomposite has been synthesized by anchoring
a glutathione-protected gold nanocluster on the surface of ESM-based
ZnO nanoparticles. According to the detailed material characterization
results, the as-synthesized nanocomposites were found to exhibit interesting
optical properties with substantial integrity between their constituents,
which turned out to be advantageous for their use as a fluorescent
probe. Fluorescence titrations of the nanocomposite with the different
DNAs reveal the favorable binding interaction of the nanocomposite
toward CT DNA with a maximum blue shift of the surface-related spectra
of the nanocomposite. In addition, the results obtained from the titrations
with synthetic polynucleotides were consistent with the fluorometric
results obtained with natural DNAs. Although we have not assigned
the specific molecular recognition of these interactions, it is quite
likely that anchoring of the gold nanocluster onto the ZnO surface
is accountable for the complex formation with AT-specific DNA, which
was evident from the fluorometric titration and XPS study. Compared
with the native ZnO, in virtue of this appreciable fluorometric change,
the synthesized nanocomposite could act as a fluorescent probe for
DNA interaction with improved specificity. More significantly, we
have also found that, contrary to the expectation, the binding of
ss CT DNA with the nanocomposite was not as effective for a noticeable
fluorometric change as it was for ds CT DNA. Hence, this AZO nanocomposite
possesses the proficiency to distinguish ss and ds DNAs, which is
a highly interesting observation for DNA-based diagnostics. Besides
fluorometric results, the thermal melting study, CD spectroscopic
results, and the thermodynamic evaluation clearly reveal the greater
binding harmony of the nanocomposite to CT DNA compared to that to
the other DNAs. Thus, it is anticipated that this type of fluorescent
ZnO–Au nanocomposite will be poised to elucidate a new perspective
in DNA-binding study with specificity and will open up an interesting
aspect in this field.

Experimental Section
Materials
Zinc
nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) was bought from Merck Ltd. All
DNAs; the synthetic polynucleotides (poly(dA)·poly(dT) and poly(dG)·poly(dC));
the corresponding monophosphate residues of the DNA; and the purine
and pyrimidine base components, i.e., adenine hydrochloride hydrate,
thymine, tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), and Hoechst 33258, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The
reduced form of l-glutathione (GSH) was purchased from Alfa
Aesar. All of the compounds were treated without any further purification.
Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used throughout the experiment.
All of the DNA solutions were prepared as previously reported.9 The concentrations of calf thymus (CT), E. coli (EC), and M. lysodeikticus (ML) DNAs were determined spectroscopically from the absorbance
value using their corresponding molar absorption coefficients.9

Synthesis of ZnO Nanoparticles
The
stock solution (0.1
M, 100 mL) of zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.9%) was prepared in distilled water. The egg shell membrane
(ESM) was scaled off manually from its CaCO3 shell of commercial
eggs and was washed properly using distilled water and dried under
an IR lamp.87 The fresh ∼1 g ESM
was immersed in the zinc salt solution and stirred on a magnetic stirrer
for 10 min, followed by keeping it at room temperature for 112 h without
any perturbation to favor the adsorption of zinc ions onto the membrane.
The white sheetlike Zn–ESM hybrid membranes were removed from
the salt solution, rinsed thoroughly using distilled water, and dried
under an IR lamp. Finally, the as-synthesized white product was calcined
at 750 °C for 4 h to prepare ZnO nanoparticles (ZO NPs).

Synthesis
of Luminescent G-Au NCs
For batch preparation,
the freshly prepared aqueous solutions of GSH (10 mL, 7.5 mM) and
HAuCl4 (10 mL, 5 mM) were mixed under gentle stirring,
followed by increasing the reaction temperature to 90 °C and
leaving for 3 h for completing the reaction. A constant volume was
maintained during the reaction. After cooling down to room temperature,
the as-obtained solution was stored at 4 °C for 24 h. The final
product was precipitated out by adding ethanol, dispersed in water,
and kept at 4 °C for further use.

Integration of ZnO Nanoparticles
with G-Au NCs
The
calcined ZnO powder (20 mg) was well dispersed in a water–ethanol
mixture by sonicating for 15 min, followed by dropwise addition of
5 mL of G-Au NC solution to it and refluxing the mixture at 120 ±
5 °C for 24 h to synthesize the ZnO–Au nanocomposite.
The final solution was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm, washed with
water several times, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C. The product
was denoted AZO.

Characterization
X-ray Diffraction Analysis
Structural characterization
of G-Au NCs, ZO nanoparticles, and AZO nanocomposite was carried out
using room temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) collected on
X’pert pro MPD XRD of the PANalytical system. The target used
was Cu Kα radiation (l = 1.5406 Å) with
a scan rate of 2°/min.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Study
Morphological
evolution of native ZnO nanoparticles (ZO), luminescent gold nanoclusters
(G-Au NCs), and AZO nanocomposite was analyzed by TEM microscopy on
a Tecnai G2 30ST (FEI) high-resolution transmission electron microscope
operated at 300 kV.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy study was performed with a PHI 5000 Versa probe II scanning
XPS microprobe (ULVAC-PHI). Monochromatic Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation accompanied by a total resolution
of about 0.7 eV and a beam size of 100 mm was maintained for the measurements.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Study
Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra have been acquired at room temperature
on a Perkin Elmer FT-IR spectrometer using the full range from 4000
to 400 cm–1 collecting 200 scans with a resolution
of 4 cm–1. The pellets were made with highly pure
potassium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich (Germany)). Before collecting the
spectra, we have varied the ratio of sample to KBr to nullify the
background signal.

Interaction Study with DNAs
Absorption
Titration
A Shimadzu UV-3600 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer was used for recording the absorption spectra. For
each titration, aliquots of a micromolar stock solution of DNA were
added successively to a fixed concentration AZO composite solution
and the absorption study was continued by maintaining 1 min as the
equilibration time per aliquot up to the saturation point.

Fluorescence
Titration
A steady-state spectrofluorimeter
(QM-40, Photon Technology International, PTI) connected by a xenon
lamp (150 W) as an excitation source was employed for fluorescence
titrations. Bare ZO NPs and the composite in the presence of different
DNAs were excited at 345 nm, and Hoechst 33258 was excited at 341
nm.

Thermal Melting Experiment
For the thermal melting
analysis (relative absorbance versus temperature curves) of each DNA
with and without the AZO nanocomposite, a Shimadzu Pharmaspec 1700
unit (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) attached with the Peltier
controlled TMSPC-8 model accessory was used. The stock solution of
DNA was mixed with the AZO composite, the measurements were performed
with the help of Teflon-stoppered eight segmented micro optical quartz
cuvettes (10 mm optical path length and 110 μL capacity), and
the temperature of the cell was increased from 20 to 110 °C,
maintaining the heating rate of 0.5 °C/min, followed by the continuous
monitoring of the absorbance change at 260 nm wavelength. From the
midpoint of the melting transition, the melting temperature (Tm) was determined.

Isothermal Calorimetric
Titration
The energetics of
the current study with each DNA was performed by isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) using a MicroCal VP-ITC unit (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton,
MA). The protocols for the measurements were maintained as described
in our earlier report.9

Circular
Dichoric Measurement
For spectropolarimetric
study, a J-815 Jasco unit (Jasco International Co. Ltd, Hachioji,
Japan) fixed with a temperature controller (model PFD 425L/15) was
used to collect spectra in the UV region from 400 to 200 nm at 20
± 0.5 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. For the CD experiment,
we have also used a 10 mm path length quartz cuvette, the concentration
of DNA used was 60 μM, and the composite concentration was increased
gradually up to saturation. For each sample, the average scan was
fitted after subtracting the buffer baseline.
