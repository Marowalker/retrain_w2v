Diarylethenes
are a well-studied class of photoswitches and have
often been linked to partner molecules to render them photoresponsive.
Earlier, our lab developed a new type of diarylethenes in which the
purine or pyrimidine base of a nucleoside or oligonucleotide serves
as one of the two aryl residues of the photochromic system. Here,
we report the synthesis of three different diarylethene-deoxyuridine
phosphoramidites and their site-specific incorporation into oligodeoxynucleotides
by solid-phase synthesis. Various DNA sequences carrying single or
multiple, identical or different photoswitchable moieties are synthesized
with high yield and purity. Upon UV irradiation, these DNA strands
form a colored closed-ring isomer. The combination of different diarylethenes
within one strand leads to an additive absorption spectrum. The photochromic
DNA oligonucleotides are thermostable and photoreversible.

Introduction
The
control and manipulation of biological systems using photoactive
small molecules is an attractive approach in chemical and synthetic
biology.1−4 Photoswitches are molecules that undergo distinct structural changes
upon irradiation with light, which is noninvasive and offers high
spatio-temporal resolution. A common approach to make biopolymers,
such as proteins or nucleic acids, sensitive toward photochemical
stimuli is their covalent linkage to photoswitchable entities. Most
reported applications use azobenzenes because of their comparatively
simple synthesis and generally good reversibility.5−8 In comparison to azobenzene-photoswitches,
diarylethenes,9−12 spiropyrans,13,14 fulgides,15,16 and hemithioindigos17 have been applied
less frequently in biomolecular systems.

Diarylethenes were
originally developed for optical information
storage in the 1980s but found a variety of applications in materials
sciences, nanotechnology, and biomimetic chemistry.3,18−22 Their most common architecture is shown in Figure 1A: two heteroaromatic, most often five-membered,
rings are connected via a (perhydrogenated or perfluorinated) cyclopentenyl
bridge. They undergo a reversible photochemical electrocyclic ring-closure
reaction. The photophysical and chemical properties, such as absorption
and isomerization wavelengths, quantum yields, extinction coefficients,
thermal stability, and fatigue resistance can be tuned by attaching
variable substituents R at the aryl rings.18,23

the closed-ring isomer. (B) Deazapurine nucleoside diarylethenes.24−26 (C) Pyrimidine nucleoside diarylethenes.27

Our group developed the first
photochromic nucleoside-based diarylethenes
in which the nucleobase is actively taking part in the switching process
(Figure 1B,C).24−27 This design warrants a stronger influence of light on the structure
and function of the nucleoside, compared to examples in which a typical
photoswitch was linked to (or separated from) the nucleoside by a
spacer.10,28,29 A strong influence
of substituents on the photophysical properties could be demonstrated
for these compounds.25,30,31 For the pyrimidine switches (Figure 1C), we also demonstrated the synthesis of oligonucleotides
carrying the same diarylethene system by Suzuki cross-coupling of
a substituted thiophenyl-cyclopentenyl boronic acid to 5-iodouridine-
and 5-iodocytidine-containing oligonucleotides.27 However, yields were hardly satisfying (35% at best for
a single coupling), and this method did not allow at all the incorporation
of two or more chemically different diarylethenes into a DNA strand
in a site-specific manner. Recently, we reported the synthesis of
a diarylethene deoxyuridine phosphoramidite (with R = phenyl), its
incorporation at up to three positions into an oligonucleotide by
solid-phase synthesis, and the application of the resulting fully
reversible photochromic oligonucleotides as a conditional fluorescence
quencher in an all-optical excitonic switch designed for next-generation
information processing.32 These oligonucleotides
switched reversibly up to 200 times without detectable fatigue both
in solution and absorbed on a dry solid surface, and increasing the
number of diarylethenes per strand was found to linearly increase
the extinction coefficient and hence, the efficiency of fluorescence
quenching.32

Herein, we take the
next step toward orthogonal photoswitches by
synthesizing oligonucleotides that carry up to three identical or
different diarylethenes as part of their sequence. Three different
phosphoramidites are synthesized, incorporated into DNA by solid-phase
synthesis, and the resulting photochromic oligonucleotides subjected
to an initial photophysical and chemical characterization (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the
Three Different Phosphoramidites
Synthesis of Photochromic Nucleosides and Phosphoramidites
5-Iodo-2′-deoxyuridine was 5′-DMT-protected using
a standard procedure.33 The resulting compound 1 was coupled with three different boronic acid esters 2a–c (Ph = phenyl, Me = methyl, and 2-Np = 2-naphthyl)
by Suzuki cross-coupling to obtain the photochromic nucleosides 3a–c in good (73–82%) yields. Phosphoramidites 4a–c were furnished by adding 2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphoramidite. For
details and analytical characterization, see Supporting Information.

Synthesis of Photoswitchable DNA Oligonucleotides
Phosphoramidites 4a–c were applied in solid-phase
synthesis to synthesize 13 different photoswitchable deoxyoligonucleotide
(PS-ODN) sequences as shown in Table 1 using the standard 1 μmol DNA synthesis and
deprotection protocol. All oligonucleotides were analyzed (Figure S1) and purified by reversed-phase HPLC
and their correct molecular weight confirmed by mass spectrometry
(Table 1).

(Ph = Phenyl, Me = Methyl, and 2-Np = 2-Naphthyl)a
a Masses determined
by mass spectrometry.
For HPLC chromatograms, see Figure S1.

All oligonucleotides have the
same nucleotide sequence, which represents
one strand of a commonly used promoter of the T7 RNA polymerase. This
sequence was chosen to allow future studies on photomodulation of
RNA polymerase activity. Three internal thymidine positions were selected
and replaced with the corresponding deoxyuridine-based diarylethenes.
First, we introduced one phenyl-modified diarylethene at a time in
the marked positions (Table 1, PS-ODN 1–3). The modified phosphoramidite
was incorporated as efficient as the standard building blocks. Then,
we introduced two and three phenyl-modified photoswitches at different
positions (Table 1, PS-ODN 4–7). Similar to the phenyl switch, single incorporation
worked efficient also for the methyl (PS-ODN 8–9) and for the 2-naphthyl phosphoramidite (PS-ODN 10–11). Finally, we incorporated two or three different photoswitches
into the same DNA strand (PS-ODN 12, 13).

Properties of the Synthesized Photoswitchable
DNA
The synthesized DNA-sequences (PS-ODN 1–13)
were subjected to an initial photophysical characterization. First,
oligonucleotides were irradiated by UV light and the ring-closure
reaction monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy. Table 2 shows a summary of the photophysical
properties.

As observed for the nucleosides,
electrocyclic ring closure leads
to the appearance of a new absorption maximum in the visible range.
The three strands with a single phenyl-modified diarylethene at different
positions have the same maximum (480 nm, Table 2, entries 1–3, Figures 2A and S2), while
their molar extinction coefficients at the photostationary state vary
slightly. The same λmax,vis was observed after the
incorporation of two or three phenyl-modified photoswitches (Table 2, entries 4–7, Figure S3), and the molar extinction coefficients
increased almost linearly with the number of modifications (Figure S4). The phenyl-modified photoswitches
turned out to be highly thermostable (insets in Figure 2); even at 70 °C the thermal ring opening
occurred with a first-order rate constant kthermal of 0.011 ± 0.002 h–1 (average over all single-modified
ODNs), corresponding to a half-life τ of 63 h.

and photophysical properties of photoswitchable
DNA. (A) R = Ph, PS-ODN 1; (B) R = Me, PS-ODN 8; (C) R = 2-Np, PS-ODN 10; (D) R = Me, Ph, 2-Np, PS-ODN 13. Inset (a) absorption at λmax,vis, inset (b) thermostability measurements of the closed-ring isomer
at different temperatures (25, 50, and 70 °C).

For DNA strands containing the methyl- or 2-naphthyl-modified
diarylethenes
(Table 2, entries 8–11; Figures 2B,C and S5) similar trends were observed. Both strands
carrying the methyl-modified photoswitch showed a maximum at 450 nm
(Table 2, entries 8,
9), while the maximum at 490 nm was noticed for the oligonucleotides
bearing the 2-naphthyl-modified photoswitch (Table 2, entries 10, 11). The observed bathochromic
shift of λmax,vis from methyl to phenyl to 2-naphthyl
is due to the increased conjugation of these residues with the neighboring
thiophene ring and the extension of the conjugated system. In all
cases, a 5–10 nm bathochromic shift of λmax,vis of the photoswitchable DNA compared to the free nucleoside is noticed
(Table 2, entries 1–11).
The naphthyl photoswitch showed a slightly reduced thermal stability
(kthermal,70°C = 0.028 ± 0.005
h–1, τ70°C = 25 h), whereas
the methyl photoswitches ring-opened much faster (kthermal,70°C = 0.25 ± 0.04 h–1, τ70°C = 2.8 h). At room temperature, however,
even this switch had excellent long-term stability (τ25°C = 48 h).

For PS-ODN 8 and 10, we
succeeded in
separating the open- and closed-ring form by HPLC, allowing the determination
of the composition of the photostationary state. For the 2-naphthyl-modified
oligonucleotide, 50% closed-ring isomers were detected, while 47%
were measured for the methyl-substituted strand (Figure S6). Similarly, we recently determined a value of 50%
for an oligonucleotide with a single phenyl-substituted diarylethene.32

For the photoswitchable DNA carrying different
diarylethene moieties
simultaneously, the absorption bands of the individual chromophores
overlapped, yielding a single absorption band with a λmax,vis that was roughly the mean value of the maxima of the individual
chromophores (Figure S7).

Upon irradiation
with visible (broad-band white) light, the absorbance
of all oligonucleotides in the visible range was reduced to zero,
and the UV–vis spectra were indistinguishable from those prior
to UV irradiation, indicating reversibility and near-quantitative
ring opening.

All DNA strands showed good to excellent thermostability
at 25,
50, and 70 °C (see insets in Figure 2).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized
three deoxyuridine-based diarylethene
phosphoramidites, in which different substituents (Ph, Me, and 2-Np)
are attached to the diarylethene moiety, and incorporated them into
DNA with an incorporation efficiency indistinguishable from standard
phosphoramidites. Applying this method, we could show for the first
time the incorporation of three chemically different photoswitches
into a single DNA strand. Furthermore, tuning of the photoinduced
electrocyclic ring closure/ring-opening process is possible by changing
the chemical nature of the substituents, as larger conjugated systems
and push–pull systems tend to shift the absorption wavelength
of the closed-ring form to longer wavelengths. However, for applications
in biological or nanotechnology systems, at least two properties of
the current system are not yet optimal: first, UV irradiation leads
to a photostationary state that contains only ∼50% of the closed-ring
forms, thereby limiting the dynamic range of responses. Second, for
orthogonal switches operating at different wavelengths, substituents
for the diarylethene system must be identified that induce larger
spectral shifts. In the current system, the absorbance maxima differ
only by 40 nm (naphthyl vs methyl). Because the absorption bands are
very broad (full widths at half-maximum ≥ 100 nm), the current
combination of substituents does not offer suitable wavelengths for
orthogonal switching. However, the synthetic methodology described
here should be applicable to a wide range of substituted deoxyuridine
diarylethenes.
