Pseudopeptides containing
the d-Oxd or the d-pGlu
[Oxd = (4R,5S)-4-methyl-5-carboxyl-oxazolidin-2-one,
pGlu = pyroglutamic acid] moiety and selected amino acids were used
as low-molecular-weight gelators to prepare strong and thixotropic
hydrogels at physiological pH. The addition of calcium chloride to
the gelator solutions induces the formation of insoluble salts that
get organized in fibers at a pH close to the physiological one. Physical
characterization of hydrogels was carried out by morphologic evaluation
and rheological measurements and demonstrated that the analyzed hydrogels
are thixotropic, as they have the capability to recover their gel-like
behavior. As these hydrogels are easily injectable and may be used
for regenerative medicine, they were biologically assessed by cell
seeding and viability tests. Human gingival fibroblasts were embedded
in 2% hydrogels; all of the hydrogels allow the growth of encapsulated
cells with a very good viability. The gelator toxicity may be correlated
with their tendency to self-assemble and is totally absent when the
hydrogel is formed.

Introduction
Regenerative medicine
is a field of increasing interest as it promotes
tissue healing after injuries and diseases.1 Tissue engineering involves the use of biomaterial scaffolds to
create in vitro three-dimensional (3-D) tissuelike structures that
simulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) where cells can grow,2−4 as often typical bidimensional cell cultures lack the ability to
effectively simulate the physiological environment. As hydrogels are
constituted mainly of water (>95%), they have been extensively
studied
as materials for cell culture and cell encapsulation5−12 and may be injected to act locally in the specific region to be treated,13−15 avoiding surgical procedures.

For these applications, the
most studied hydrogels are based on
natural biopolymers, such as collagen, fibrin, hyaluronic acid, gelatin,
chitosan, cellulose, alginate, and agarose.6,16 These
biomaterials do not meet simultaneously all of the design parameters
of an ideal injectable hydrogel (cell adhesion, lifetime, body compatibility,
and mechanical strength); moreover, their gelation and mechanical
properties cannot be tuned, as they should be used without any chemical
modification to maintain their biocompatibility.

In contrast,
short peptide chains, that act as low-molecular-weight
gelators (LMWGs) as they contain several aromatic rings that favor
the formation of hydrogels by means of π–π interactions,9,17−22 are biocompatible and may form hydrogels under several conditions;
thus, they enable us to finely tune all of the properties to reach
the optimal condition for 3-D cell cultures and good mechanical strength.

Several techniques may promote the gelation process of these molecules,
salt addition,19,23,24 pH variation,25,26 enzymatic cleavage,27,28 dissolution in solvent mixtures,4 ultrasound
sonication,29,30 although some of these methods
may cause cell death.

As LMWGs self-assemble by physical interactions,
the hydrogels
may show a thixotropic behavior, which means that the gel becomes
liquid if a shear stress is applied and then it quickly recovers the
solid form on resting.31−34 This property allows us to easily inject by syringe the molten hydrogel,
which self-adapts in the space inside the injection site and quickly
recovers the solid form.35 Currently, there
is no way to predict whether a peptide will be a good hydrogelator;
nevertheless, a variety of systematic studies show that amphiphilic
peptides and N-protected peptides with aromatic groups
are able to form gels in water.36−38

We recently reported several
pseudopeptides that freeze water in
low concentration and form hydrogels that possess high mechanical
strength and transparency.39−41 All of these peptides showed
a good propensity to self-assemble in water because of the presence
of the d-Oxd or d-pGlu moiety [Oxd = (4R,5S)-4-methyl-5-carboxyl-oxazolidin-2-one, pGlu
= pyroglutamic acid] in their skeleton.42,43 The constraint
imposed by the trans conformation of the two carbonyls of the Oxd
and pGlu moieties, together with the presence of aromatic rings, allows
the formation of intramolecular interactions that lead to the creation
of fibers,44,45 which self-assemble to yield
a gel.

The pH variation method25 used
to trigger
the gelation process of these compounds allows the formation of gels
with low pH values that are not suitable for cell proliferation.

In the present study, we discuss the preparation, characterization,
and biological assessment of hydrogels prepared using pseudopepetide
gelators, containing the d-Oxd or d-pGlu moiety
and selected amino acids. Calcium chloride is used as a trigger to
form strong and thixotropic hydrogels at physiological pH, emulating
what is usually done to form alginate hydrogels.7,46,47

Results and Discussion
Gelators A–C (Figure 1) were prepared in multigram
scale, starting from commercially available d-Thr, d-Glu, Fmoc-l-Tyr(t-Bu)-OH, Fmoc-l-Phe-OH, and azelaic acid, by standard coupling and protection/deprotection
procedures, as previously reported.21,30,39,42

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
gelators A–C studied in this work.

The hydrogels have been prepared
using gelators A–C in either 1 or
2% w/w concentration and a stoichiometric
amount of aqueous 1 M NaOH. The procedure adopted to form the hydrogel
is crucial to obtain good and reproducible results: if CaCl2 is added to a standing gelator solution, a gel rapidly forms, but
after a few hours, it collapses, forming a precipitate. In contrast,
CaCl2 addition to stirred solutions ends up with the formation
of hydrogels that are stable for days. This phenomenon is probably
related to the nonuniformity of the hydrogels formed when stirring
is missing.

As calcium is a covalent cation and behaves as a
supramolecular
cross-linker between the carboxylic moieties of the gelators molecules,47,48 we added a stoichiometric amount of CaCl2 to the solutions
to test its effect on the hydrogel formation. The overall results
are not satisfactory, as only the solutions containing gelator B form hydrogels, whereas gelators A and C form very weak hydrogels, even at 2% w/w concentration (Table S1 and Figure S1).

Recently, Adams
and co-workers studied the addition of divalent
cations to a solution of naphthalenediphenylalanine that forms a rigid,
self-supporting hydrogel.49 They found
out that the hydrogel strength (measured as G′)
reached a maximum at a ratio of calcium to carboxylic acid of approximately
2:1 but that good results may also be obtained with different ratios.
Thus, we tested the ability of gelators A–C to form hydrogels with different calcium/carboxylic acid
ratios: excellent results were obtained with substoichiometric amounts
of calcium chloride (Table 1), with the formation of self-supporting and strong hydrogels,
even with 1% w/w gelator concentration, which is the minimum gelator
concentration (Figure 2).

a Syneresis occurs on heating.

Hydrogels 7, 8, 11, and 12 show also a thixotropic behavior, as they become liquid
if a shear stress is applied and then they quickly recover the solid
form on resting, with no variation of the Tgel.

More information on the nature of hydrogels 7–12 was obtained by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis
of aerogels prepared by freeze-drying these samples (Figure 3). Thixotropic gels 7, 8, 11, and 12 furnish aerogels
characterized by complex patterns with a rough orientation, whereas
hydrogels 9 and 10 furnish aerogels characterized
by dense fibrous networks. These observations suggest that when the
hydrogel results from the formation of dense fibrous networks, the
application of a shear stress destroys these networks, which hardly
get quickly reorganized; thus, it inhibits the hydrogel reformation.

the samples of hydrogels 7–12.

To analyze the viscoelastic behavior
of the most promising hydrogels, 8, 10,
and 12, rheological analyses
have been performed to evaluate them in terms of storage and loss
moduli (G′ and G″,
respectively) (Table 2 and Figure S2). All of the analyzed hydrogels
are characterized by a “solidlike” behavior, that is,
the storage modulus is approximately an order of magnitude higher
than that of the loss component. Furthermore, the values of G′ and G″ obtained through
strain sweep experiments well-correlate with the previously performed Tgel analysis, confirming that the stiffer gel
among the obtained ones is hydrogel 8, followed by hydrogels 10 and 12.

Table 2 Storage (G′)
and Loss (G″) Moduli of the Hydrogels Obtained
Starting from Gelators 8, 10, and 12
hydrogel	G′ (Pa)	G″ (Pa)	Tgel (°C)	
8	44 000	4000	100	
10	17 000	2500	75	
12	10 500	1000	60	
Frequency sweep analysis (Figure S2)
pointed out that for all of the obtained hydrogels both G′ and G″ were almost independent from
the frequency in the range from 0.1 to 100 rad/s (always with G′ > G″), confirming the
previously discussed solidlike rheological behavior for the analyzed
hydrogels.

Step strain experiments were performed to check the
thixotropic
behavior of 8, 10, and 12 at
the molecular level. The strain values within and above the linear
viscoelastic (LVE) region were consecutively applied to the hydrogels,
which lose their solidlike behavior (G′ < G″) when the strain is applied above their LVE region
and quickly go back to a solidlike state (G′
> G″) when the strain is applied to the LVE region
of the hydrogels (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Values of storage moduli G′ (■)
and loss moduli G″ (red ●) recorded
during a step strain experiment performed on hydrogels (A) 8, (B) 10, and (C) 12.

The results observed for hydrogels 8 and 12 show that they are characterized by a great capability
to recover
the gel-like behavior and confirm their thixotropic properties at
the molecular level. In addition, hydrogel 10 is a thixotropic
hydrogel from a molecular point of view, although it does not fully
recover the solidlike behavior, when the strain level goes back within
the LVE region.

Cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility studies were
carried out on
diluted solutions of gelators A–C. Human fibroblasts were grown for 24 h in the presence of gelators A–C at increasing concentrations up to
5 mM (about 0.3 w/w concentration), which is always much lower than
the concentration needed to form hydrogels.

The toxicity of
gelators A–C was
evaluated by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay.50,51 The results show a low toxicity of B solutions up to
a concentration of 5 mM with a cell viability of 95% with respect
to the control. In contrast, the cell viability decreases upon using C and A solutions (72.2 and 72.7% of living cells
at a concentration of 5 mM, respectively) after 24 h of incubation
(Figure 5). We previously
noticed that gelator B tends to form dense fibrous networks,
so the very low toxicity could be correlated with the tendency of
the gelator to self-assemble. This effect has been recently observed
for amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) that exist as soluble oligomers
and are extremely neurotoxic.52 Moreover,
several studies have shown that the soluble pool of Aβ is better
correlated to cognitive decline than the insoluble pool.53,54

Figure 5 Cytotoxicity
of gelators A–C measured
by the LDH assay on human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells after 24
h of incubation with increasing gelator concentrations (from 5 μM
to 5 mM). Data are expressed as relative percentage compared to control
HGFs.

Bearing this preliminary result
in mind, we evaluated the behavior
of living cells trapped in the hydrogels. The fibroblasts were embedded
in 2% hydrogels prepared in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin
(50 UI/mL), and streptomycin (0.05 mg/mL) under the same
conditions as those for 8, 10, and 12. Gelators A–C efficiently
promoted the formation of hydrogels from this medium, although it
is not pure water, thus showing their versatility in hydrogel formation.
This operation was simplified by the hydrogels’ thixotropic
behavior: the gels were prepared and shaked to recover the sol state;
thereafter, the cells were rapidly embedded and the resulting solution
was allowed to stand for 6 h to reform the hydrogels. The overall
results show a reduced toxicity of all of the hydrogels, which well-correlate
with the 3-D network formation. Thus, the viability did not statistically
differ in hydrogels 8 and 10 (compared to
that in the previous experiments) after 24 h of culture, whereas the
toxicity of 12 drastically decreased. After 7 days of
incubation, when the 3-D networks are completely formed and the hydrogels
still maintain their shape, the number of living cells increases for
the three samples (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Viability of embedded HGFs in hydrogels 8, 10, and 12 after (A) 24 h and (B) 7 days of culture. Data
are expressed as relative percentage ± standard deviation compared
to control HGFs.

These results are in
agreement with our previous observations on
gelator solutions and indicate that the toxicity of gelators is completely
eliminated when the molecules are self-assembled, showing no substantial
differences with the behavior of the most commonly used gelators for
pharmaceutical and medical applications (such as gelatin,55−57 alginate,5,7 chitosan,58,59 agarose,14,60,61 and hyaluronate62,63).

Finally, the suitability of the hydrogels for long-term
cell culture
and therapeutic approaches has been confirmed by the evaluation of
the NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase mitochondrial enzymes’
activity using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) as a substrate: the presence of formazan crystals in
the cells indicates a good cell viability after 7 days of culture
(Figure 7), thus confirming
that these hydrogels may be used for 3-D cell culture useful in regenerative
medicine.

Figure 7 Microscopic images of HGFs embedded within (A) hydrogel 8, (B) hydrogel 10, and (C) control HGFs after 7 days
of culture treated by MTT. Blue formazan crystals are well-visible
inside the cell. Cells trapped in hydrogel 12 are not
shown as the gel turbidity did not allow us to capture clear images.
The bars correspond to 50 μm.

Conclusions
The preparation, characterization, and biological
assessment of
hydrogels prepared using pseudopepetide gelators, containing the d-Oxd or the d-pGlu moiety and selected amino acids,
have been studied and reported. A substoichiometric amount of calcium
chloride was used as a trigger, as it allows the formation of strong
and thixotropic hydrogels at physiological pH. This behavior was observed
at the macroscopic level and confirmed at a molecular level by rheological
analyses, which were used to assess the viscoelastic behavior of the
most promising hydrogels in terms of storage and loss moduli.

Then, cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility studies were carried out
on diluted solutions (up to 5 mM) of gelators A–C, followed by the biocompatibility evaluation of hydrogels 8, 10, and 12. The results show
low toxicity of both the gelator solutions and the hydrogels. In addition,
after 7 days, when all of the 3-D networks are completely formed,
the number of living cells increases in all of the samples and the
gelator toxicity is totally eliminated. This result is in agreement
with what has been recently observed for the APPs, as the soluble
pool of Aβ better correlates with the cognitive decline than
the insoluble pool.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
chemicals and solvents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, VWR, or Iris Biotech and were used as received.
Acetonitrile was distilled under inert atmosphere before use. MilliQ
water (Millipore, resistivity = 18.2 mΩ cm) was used throughout.
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (50 UI/mL), and streptomycin
(0.05 mg/mL) was purchased by Life Technologies. The LDH kit was purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Synthesis of HO-d-Oxd-l-Phe-CO(CH2)7CO-l-Phe-d-Oxd-OH A
Compound A was
synthesized from d-Thr, azelaic
acid, and Boc-l-Phe-OH following a multistep procedure in
solution, reported in ref (26).

Synthesis of Fmoc-l-Tyr-d-Oxd-OH B
Compound B was synthesized
from d-Thr and Fmoc-l-Tyr(t-Bu)-OH
following
a multistep procedure in solution, reported in ref (34).

Synthesis of Fmoc-l-Phe-d-pGlu-OH C
Compound C was synthesized from d-pGlu and Fmoc-l-Phe-OH
following a multistep procedure
in solution, reported in ref (17).

Conditions for Gel Formation with Gelator A
A portion of gelator A (5–10
mg, depending on
the final concentration, ranging from 1 to 2% w/w) was placed in a
test tube (diameter: 8 mm), and then, MilliQ water (0.5 mL) and 2
equiv of 1 M aqueous NaOH were added. The mixture was stirred until
complete compound dissolution. Different amounts of CaCl2 were added to the solution under rapid stirring (see Tables 1 and S1 for details), and then, the tubes were allowed to stand quiescently
until gel formation, which occurred after about 10 min.

Conditions
for Gel Formation with Gelator B or C
A portion of gelator B or C (5–10
mg, depending on the final concentration, ranging from
1 to 2% w/w) was placed in a test tube (diameter: 8 mm), then MilliQ
water (0.5 mL) and 1 M aqueous NaOH (1 equiv) were added, and the
mixture was stirred until sample dissolution. Different amounts of
CaCl2 were added to the solution under rapid stirring (see Tables 1 and S1 for details), and then, the tubes were allowed
to stand quiescently until gel formation, which occurred after about
10 min.

Conditions for Tgel Determination
Tgel was determined by heating the
test tube (diameter: 8 mm) containing the hydrogel sample and a glass
ball (diameter: 5 mm, weight: 165 mg) on the top of it. When the hydrogel
is formed, the ball is suspended atop. The Tgel is the temperature at which the ball starts to penetrate
inside the gel. Some hydrogel samples melt, producing a clear solution,
whereas in other cases, the gelator shrinks and water is ejected,
as syneresis occurs.

Aerogel Preparation
Some samples
of hydrogels 7–12 were freeze-dried
using a Benchtop
Freeze Dry System LABCONCO 7740030 with the following procedure: the
hydrogel (0.5 mL) was prepared in an Eppendorf test tube at room temperature.
After 16 h, the samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen for
10 min and then freeze-dried for 24 h in vacuo (0.2 mBar) at −50
°C.

Morphological Analysis
Scanning electron micrographs
of the samples were recorded using a Hitachi 6400 field emission gun
scanning electron microscope.

Rheology
Rheology
experiments were carried out on an
Anton Paar rheometer MCR 102 using a parallel plate configuration
(25 mm diameter). Experiments were performed at a constant temperature
of 23 °C controlled by the integrated Peltier system and a Julabo
AWC100 cooling system. To keep the sample hydrated, a solvent trap
was used (H-PTD200). The amplitude and frequency sweep analyses were
performed with a fixed gap value of 0.5 mm on hydrogel samples prepared
directly on the upper plate of the rheometer once the gelation reaction
was completed. The samples were prepared the day before the analysis
and left overnight at a controlled temperature of 20 °C to complete
the gelation process. Oscillatory amplitude sweep experiments (γ:
0.01–100%) were carried out to determine the LVE range at a
fixed frequency of 1 rad/s. Once the LVE range of each hydrogel was
established, frequency sweep tests were performed (ω: 0.1–100
rad/s) at constant strain within the LVE region of each sample. Thixotropic
experiments were conducted on hydrogels 8, 10, and 12 by applying consecutive deformation and recovery
steps. The deformation step was performed by applying to the gels
a constant strain above the LVE region of each sample for a period
of 7 min. The recovery step was performed by keeping the sample at
a constant strain within the LVE region for 7 min. The cycles were
performed multiple times at a fixed frequency of 1 rad/s.

Isolation
and Culture of HGFs
HGFs were obtained from
healthy patients subjected to gingivectomy of the molar region. Informed
consent was obtained from each patient. Immediately after the removal,
the tissues were washed in phosphate buffer, cut in small pieces,
and placed in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (50 UI/mL),
and streptomycin (0.05 mg/mL), at 37 °C in a 5% humidified CO2 atmosphere. After the first passage, the HGFs were routinely
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and were not used beyond
the fifth passage.

Evaluation of Gelator Cytocompatibility
Cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 20 000 cells/cm2. The gelators were solubilized at concentrations from 5 μM
to 5 mM in culture media, and cytotoxicity of the compounds was evaluated
by measuring the cytosolic LDH activity in the culture supernatants.

The LDH assay was performed after 24 h of incubation using a commercial
LDH kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations. LDH is
a cytosolic enzyme present in many different cell types. The plasma
membrane damage releases LDH into the cell culture media. Extracellular
LDH in the media can be quantified by a coupled enzymatic reaction
in which LDH catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate via NAD+ reduction to NADH. Diaphorase then uses NADH to reduce a
tetrazolium salt to a red formazan product that can be measured at
490 nm. The level of formazan formation is directly proportional to
the amount of LDH released into the medium, which is indicative of
the cytotoxicity. To determine total LDH activity, cells from the
positive control group were treated with 1% Triton X-100. The optical density in
each well was measured using a spectrophotometer microplate reader
(model 680; Bio-Rad Lab. Inc., CA) at a wavelength of 490 nm. Each
experiment was performed three times, and four replicate cell cultures
were analyzed in each experiment.

Cell Seeding and Cytotoxicity
Test
Gelators A, B, or C (10 mg) were solubilized in 0.5
mL of DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS, penicillin (50 UI/mL), and streptomycin
(0.05 mg/mL) under sonication at room temperature during 15 min. Once
liquid solutions were obtained, 1 M NaOH (2 equiv for A and 1 equiv for B or C) followed by 0.2
M CaCl2 (0.6 equiv for A and 0.3 equiv for B or C) were added to the solutions, with the
immediate formation of hydrogels that rested at room temperature without
agitation for 30 min. To allow cell seeding, the gel was heated at
37 °C and thoroughly mixed with 100 μL of cell suspension
at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/mL of gel and
the gel/cell systems were transferred into different wells of a 12-well
plate and maintained under controlled atmosphere (5% CO2, 37 °C) for 24 h and 7 days. After each experimental point,
the gel/cell constructs were transferred into 1.5 mL vials, centrifuged
at 160g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used
to check the cytotoxicity by the LDH assay described above. Light
microscopy observation of living cells was performed using the MTT
assay. After each experimental point, 100 μL of a MTT stock
solution was added into each well to reach a final concentration
of 1 mM. After that, the samples were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C
in a controlled atmosphere and the resulting blue formazan crystals
were observed in living cells.
