The development of new antitubercular agents for the treatment
of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium
tuberculosis is an urgent priority. Pyrrolobenzodiazepines
(PBDs) are a promising class of antibacterial agents that were initially
discovered and isolated from a range of Streptomyces species. Recently, C8-linked PBD monomers have been shown to work
by inhibiting DNA gyrase and have demonstrated activity against M. tuberculosis. However, both PBD monomers and dimers
are toxic to eukaryotic cells, limiting their development as antibacterial
agents. To eliminate the toxicity associated with PBDs and explore
the effect of C8-modification with a known antibacterial agent with
the same mechanism of action (i.e., ciprofloxacin, a gyrase inhibitor),
we synthesized a C8-linked PBD–ciprofloxacin (PBD–CIP, 3) hybrid. The hybrid compound displayed minimum inhibitory
concentration values of 0.4 or 2.1 μg/mL against drug-sensitive
and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains,
respectively. A molecular modeling study showed good interaction of
compound 3 with wild-type M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase, suggesting gyrase inhibition as a possible mechanism
of action. Compound 3 is a nontoxic combination hybrid
that can be utilized as a new scaffold and further optimized to develop
new antitubercular agents.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most serious bacterial infections,
with around 10 million new cases and an average of almost 1.3 million
deaths in 2017 alone.1 Novel strategies
are required to treat TB and specifically target drug-resistant strains
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which
are increasing worldwide. A lengthy multidrug regimen is needed to
eradicate the infection, which complicates the treatment of TB and
threatens our attempts to control this pandemic. Therefore, there
is an urgent need for new, improved antibiotics that will shorten
treatment times.2 Only a few new TB drugs
are in clinical trials, and since the 1960s, there have only been
two new antibiotics, bedaquiline and delaminid, developed for treatment;
these drugs are only given to patients with extensively drug-resistant
(XDR)-TB or pre-XDR-TB. The WHO End-TB strategy aims to reduce TB
deaths by 95% and to cut new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035 with
the ultimate aim to end the global TB epidemic.3 This goal will only be achieved through improved TB control
measures and innovative tools for the discovery of new interventions. M. tuberculosis has evolved many mechanisms for avoiding
the effects of antibiotics. Its waxy, impermeable coat does not allow
for the easy penetration of antibiotics, and, in addition, the organism
possesses efflux systems that allow for the rapid expulsion of antibiotics.4 One approach for TB drug development is the potentiation
of existing antibiotics, and this could accelerate drug discovery
efforts.

Recently, the PBD class of sequence-specific DNA minor groove binding
agents has been recognized as potential chemotherapeutic and antibacterial
agents.5−8 They have a kinetic preference for 5′-Py–G–Py-3′
sequences,9 while 5′-AGA-3′
has been established as the thermodynamically preferred sequence.10 PBDs are able to act as covalent binding agents
by positioning themselves securely within the DNA minor groove and
selecting for GC-rich sequences. This is made possible by the particular
three-dimensional (3D) shape afforded to them by a chiral center at
their C11a(S)-position. PBDs can also form an aminal
linkage between their C11-position and the C2-NH2 group
of a guanine base once securely within the minor groove, due to the
presence of a “soft” electrophilic imine moiety at their
N10–C11-position.11,12 Naturally occurring
PBD monomers such as anthramycin, tomaymycin, neothramycin, and sibiromycin
form adducts that span three base pairs, with guanine in the central
position,13,14 while the larger synthetic C8-linked PBD
monomers and PBD dimers can span up to eight base pairs.15−18 The side chains of PBD monomers play a key role in DNA sequence
recognition and fit of the PBDs within the DNA minor groove, which
has been linked to their cytotoxicity.7 C8-substituents with pyrrole and imidazole heterocycles,15 biaryls (e.g., 4-(1-methyl-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)-benzenamine (MPB)),16 and
benzofused rings (e.g., benzofuran and benzothiophene)17,18 have been shown to facilitate binding and stabilization of DNA,
while large bulky groups like porphyrins reduce the ability of PBDs
to bind to duplex DNA due to steric factors.19 C8-linked PBD monomers have shown notable antibacterial activity
against MDR Gram-positive bacteria6,8 and M. tuberculosis.20 More
recently, DNA gyrase inhibition has been reported as an additional
mechanism of action of antibacterial PBDs.6 A study by Brucoli et al. evaluated 12 C8-linked PBD-heterocyclic
polyamide conjugates for antitubercular activity and DNA sequence
selectivity.20 These PBD conjugates exhibited
significant growth inhibition of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from
0.08 to 5.19 μg/mL. As is the case for other PBD compounds,
these compounds demonstrated cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells due
to DNA binding. To eliminate the cytotoxicity associated with PBDs,16,18 we aimed to develop an antitubercular C8-PBD conjugate that could
not be accommodated easily within the DNA minor groove, due to the
presence of a large C8-substituent while retaining antimycobacterial
activity.

We selected ciprofloxacin, a known gyrase inhibitor, as the C8-substituent
to develop a PBD–ciprofloxacin hybrid molecule as ciprofloxacin
possesses the same mechanism of action as PBDs.6 Ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are used in the
management of MDR-TB (Figure 1), but the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant M. tuberculosis is a cause for significant concern.
Alternative approaches such as the development of hybrid molecules
can overcome resistance, extend the life span of current treatments,
and expand the pool of first-line drugs that are available for TB
treatment. Ciprofloxacin hybrids with both small molecules21 and macromolecules22,23 have been used as a strategy to improve activity and overcome resistance
in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We conjugated a
C8-linker-containing PBD to ciprofloxacin through its piperazine moiety.
This conjugation allowed the carboxylic acid group of ciprofloxacin
to remain unmodified, which is crucial for its activity and provided
a C8-PBD hybrid with a large bulky substituent, which would influence
the DNA binding and hence the toxicity of the PBDs. The hybrid demonstrated
no DNA binding and was found to be nontoxic against eukaryotic cell
lines. It was anticipated that the synthesized PBD–CIP hybrid
would maintain its ability to interact with DNA gyrase due to its
structural similarity with C8-PBD monomers, and an in silico study
demonstrated good interaction with M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase. The hybrid compound displayed MIC values of 0.4 or 2.1
μg/mL against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, respectively, which is comparable
to the MIC values reported for C8-linked PBDs against M. tuberculosis.20 This
is the first report of a nontoxic C8-linked PBD hybrid with activity
against M. tuberculosis and is a starting
point for the development of nontoxic PBD molecules that do not bind
DNA as new antibiotics for TB treatment.

Results and Discussion
Design, In Silico Modeling, and Synthesis of Fluoroquinolone–Pyrrolobenzodiazepine
Hybrid
The fluoroquinolone–pyrrolobenzodiazepine hybrid
(compound 3, Figure 2) was designed by considering the structure–activity
relationship data available for fluoroquinolone and pyrrolobenzodiazepine
classes of molecules. The substituted 4-quinolone ring and the tricyclic
pyrrolobenzodiazepine system were connected through a C4 chemical
spacer. The C8-position of the PBD A-ring and C7-position of ciprofloxacin
were selected for chemical modification as the SAR data for these
chemical classes indicated that structural changes are allowed in
these positions. The OH group of the C8-position of the PBD was linked
to the C7-piperazine group of ciprofloxacin via a 4C linker with a
terminal carboxylic acid group.

Figure 2 Design of the fluoroquinolone–pyrrolobenzodiazepine hybrid.

To explore the ability of compound 3 to interact with
DNA gyrase enzyme, it was docked with both wild-type and S95T mutant
gyrase (present within M. tuberculosis strains of East Asian, Central Asian, and EuroAmerican lineages)
from M. tuberculosis. Compound 3 showed a −35.84 kcal/mol free energy of binding and
a ChemScore of 30.67 compared to a −27.45 kcal/mol free energy
of binding and a ChemScore of 24.89 observed for ciprofloxacin. The
free energy of binding and ChemScore for compound 3 against
the S95T mutant were comparable to those observed for ciprofloxacin
(−28.1 vs −27.5 kcal/mol and 24.45 vs 25.46, respectively).
Compound 3 showed greater interaction with both wild-type
and S95T mutant gyrase enzyme gyrA (Figures 3 and S1, Tables S1–S4) compared to ciprofloxacin. The ciprofloxacin component of the compound
showed hydrogen bond interactions with arginine 39 and alanine 986
residues, while the PBD component showed hydrophobic interactions
with proline 124 and tyrosine 93 residues. The interaction of compound 3 with GyrA S95T was comparable to that observed for ciprofloxacin
(Figure S2). This modeling data suggested
that compound 3 could interact with GyrA, occupying a
binding pocket close to the ciprofloxacin binding pocket. Therefore,
it was decided to synthesize the hybrid compound and evaluate its
activity against M. tuberculosis strains.

Figure 3 Two-dimensional (2D) and 3D structures of ciprofloxacin (A, B)
and compound 3 (C, D) within the binding site of the
wild type of DNA gyrase A.

Compound 3 was synthesized according to the synthetic
scheme reported in Scheme 1. The N10 alloc–tetrahydropyranyl (THP) protected pyrrolobenzodiazepine
core 1 was synthesized according to the nine-step literature-reported
procedure16. Commercially available ciprofloxacin
ethyl ester 1 was coupled to the protected pyrrolobenzodiazepine
core structure 2 to form the amide bond connection required
to link the two pharmacophores. N-Ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) were selected as the coupling system for the formation of the
amide bond. This was followed by hydrolysis of the ciprofloxacin ethyl
ester to generate the active carboxylic acid. Finally, the N10 alloc–THP
group was deprotected in the presence of palladium to generate the
reactive imine group between N10 and C11 of the pyrrolobenzodiazepine
structure. The final compound (3, PBD–CIP) was
purified using liquid column chromatography with a dichloromethane
(DCM)/methanol gradient. The compound was fully characterized by NMR
and MS spectrometric techniques prior to biological evaluation.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Scheme for PBD–CIP (3)
Evaluation of DNA Binding Ability of Compound 3
PBDs are known to interact covalently with the DNA minor
groove, which is the key source of their eukaryotic toxicity. The
ability of compound 3 to bind and stabilize DNA was evaluated
using a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based DNA
melting assay24 using two fluorophore-labeled
oligonucleotide sequences (sequence F1: 5′-FAM-TAT-ATA-TAG-ATA-TTT-TTT-TAT-CTA-TAT-ATA-3′-TAMRA
and sequence F2: 5′-FAM-TAT-AGA-TAT-AGA-TAT-TTT-ATA-TCT-ATA-TCT-ATA-3′-TAMRA)
to understand the effect of the relatively bulky ciprofloxacin building
block. Netropsin, a known DNA minor groove binder, and a previously
reported C8-linked PBD with antibacterial activity, PBD-Py-Py (GWL-78, Figure 1), were used as positive controls. Netropsin showed a 16 °C
stabilization of sequence F1 and a 13.5 °C stabilization of sequence
F2 at 1 μM; GWL-78 showed an 18 °C stabilization
of sequence F1 and a 16.5 °C stabilization of sequence F2. However,
compound 3 showed weak stabilization of both DNA sequences,
with ΔTm values between 1 and 1.5
°C at a 1 μM concentration (drug/DNA ratio 5:1) (Table 1). The result suggests
that the bulky ciprofloxacin substitution at the C8-position of the
PBD reduces the ability of compound 3 to interact and
stabilize the DNA sequences. Most PBD monomers stabilize duplex DNA
sequences in the range of 8–18 °C and show low micromolar
to nanomolar IC50s against eukaryotic cell lines.5 As DNA binding and stabilization are linked to
the eukaryotic toxicity of pyrrolobenzodiazepines,25 this lack of DNA binding observed for compound 3 was expected to reduce the toxicity of the newly synthesized hybrid.

Evaluation of Eukaryotic Toxicity
The aim of the study
is to develop a compound with antitubercular activity, as well as
selective toxicity toward prokaryotes. However, DNA stabilization
has been associated with cytotoxicity for PBD-type covalent minor
groove binders.25 Therefore, the eukaryotic
cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds was tested in the cervical
cancer cell line HeLa and the nontumor lung fibroblast WI-38 using
an MTT assay with GWL-78 as the control.26 Compound 3 did not show any notable toxicity
(>90% survival at 24 h) at the highest concentration (20 μM)
tested, while 24% HeLa cells and 41% WI-38 cells survived after 24
h incubation with 20 μM GWL-78. These results are
encouraging, especially as standard C8-linked PBD monomers tend to
show high levels of cytotoxicity.

Microbiological Evaluation of Compound 3
The activity of compound 3 and ciprofloxacin was determined
using M. tuberculosis H37Rv and two
clinical M. tuberculosis isolates of
Beijing/W lineage, 1192/015 and 08/00483E (multidrug-resistant, Table S5). Both clinical isolates harbor mutations
within the DNA gyrase gene (gyrA) (Table 2); however, these mutations
do not confer resistance to fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin.

A modified resazurin microtiter assay in combination with a modified
Gompertz function27 was used to generate
MIC values for compound 3 and ciprofloxacin. A dose-dependent
response of bacterial growth inhibition was observed for all strains
exposed to compound 3 or ciprofloxacin, thereby confirming
antimicrobial activity for both compounds (Figures 4 and 5).

HeLa and WI-38 cell line. The lack of cytotoxicity observed for compound 3 was statistically significant compared to that for GWL-78.

growth inhibition of M. tuberculosis strains H37Rv (black), M. tuberculosis 1192/015 (red), and M. tuberculosis 08/00483E (blue) by ciprofloxacin (0.094–6.036 μM)
(A) and compound 3 (0.048–3.1 μM) (B). Twofold
serial dilutions of each antibiotic were evaluated. The antibiotic
activity was ascertained by the addition of resazurin, and the optical
density (OD570nm) was measured. The OD570nm measurements
were converted to a percentage of the OD570nm measurements
for the control that contained no antibiotic. The values plotted are
a percentage of the growth without antibiotic and are the mean values
of three independent experiments ± standard deviation and analyzed
using Student’s t test. Vertical lines indicate
modified Gompertz-determined MIC values.

MIC values were calculated for three M. tuberculosis strains (H37Rv, Beijing susceptible strain 1192/015, and Beijing
drug-resistant strain 08/00483E) that were exposed to either ciprofloxacin
or compound 3 at concentration ranges of 0.094–6.036
and 0.048–3.1 μM, respectively. Three independent replicate
experiments were performed for each strain and each antibiotic. An
MIC was determined for each replicate experiment using a modified
Gompertz function. The three independent MIC values for each strain
were used to calculate the mean MIC and standard deviation from the
mean.

The MICs of ciprofloxacin for both clinical isolates were not significantly
different from the MIC calculated for M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Figure 4A
and Table 3). In contrast,
the exposure of M. tuberculosis strains
to compound 3 resulted in markedly different dose-dependent
responses, and the MIC values recorded for M. tuberculosis Beijing/W strains were significantly greater than the MIC recorded
for M. tuberculosis H37Rv.

The MIC value for compound 3 against H37Rv (0.413
± 0.0004 μg/mL) is comparable to that reported for C8-linked
PBD monomers with traditional heteroaromatic building blocks (MIC
range 5.19–0.08 μg/mL) by Brucoli et al.20 However, C8-PBD monomers with heteroaromatic building blocks
are cytotoxic15 and not considered desirable
candidates for development as antimicrobial agents. Therefore, the
activity observed for the noncytotoxic compound 3 is
encouraging and provides an opportunity to further improve the activity
of this chemical series through medicinal chemistry optimization.
Compound 3 had comparable activity to ciprofloxacin in
inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, suggesting that the increased molecular level interaction
of compound 3 with DNA gyrase, as indicated by molecular
modeling data, did not result in a more active compound against M. tuberculosis compared to ciprofloxacin.

Although inhibitory to the growth of clinical M.
tuberculosis strains (1192/015 and 08/00483E) at low
micromolar concentrations, compound 3 is approximately
fivefold less active than ciprofloxacin against these strains. The
molecular modeling study suggested greater interaction with S95T mutant
gyrase A, which is present in these strains, compared to that of ciprofloxacin.
Therefore, this reduction in activity observed for compound 3 was surprising. In the absence of a biochemical assay to
directly measure the inhibition of the mutant S95T enzyme, it is not
possible to fully ascertain the reason behind the reduction in activity.
The relatively higher molecular weight of compound 3 might
play a role in its ability to cross the mycobacterial membrane, particularly
if cell wall alteration contributes to the resistance of these clinical
strains against antitubercular agents. These results suggest that
the addition of pyrrolobenzodiazepine to ciprofloxacin has reduced
its activity against mutant strains through an unknown mechanism.
Potential explanations for this observation include greater affinity
of efflux pumps for compound 3 or reduced permeability
of compound 3 through the mycobacterial cell wall. This
is supported by the observation that Beijing/W M. tuberculosis strains (including M. tuberculosis 1192/015 and 08/00483E) harbor a deletion of the RD105 region of
the genome (Rv0071–Rv0074) that results in the thickening of
the cell wall and reduced intracellular concentrations of antibiotics.28 The deletion of the RD105 region results in
a gene fusion of Rv0071 and Rv0074 generating a gene product with
carbopeptidase activity that can cleave peptidoglycan, potentially
enhancing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan to increase the thickness
of the cell wall. Further experimentation would be required to elucidate
these hypotheses. Calculation of c log P by ChemBioOffice 16.0 showed that compound 3 was more hydrophobic (c log P 1.85) compared to ciprofloxacin (c log P −0.72). This increased hydrophobicity may reduce
uptake and therefore the intracellular concentration of compound 3 in the Beijing/W strains due to the hydrophilic nature of
peptidoglycan. This can also affect the efflux potential of the compound
as molecules with more hydrophobic side chains are considered as preferred
substrates of efflux pumps.29

The mutations noted in Table 2 may further reduce the ability of compound 3 to bind effectively with the mutated DNA gyrase A, although the
molecular modeling study suggested comparable binding affinities for
both wild-type and S95T mutant enzymes. Despite compound 3 being less active than ciprofloxacin in some strains, the identification
of a new hybrid chemical class with activity against M. tuberculosis provides the drug development pipeline
with new chemical scaffolds to work on. Both the pharmacophores, pyrrolobenzodiazepine
and fluoroquinolones, which are present in the hybrid compound 3 have shown clinical utility in cancer and infection, respectively.

Compound 3 displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of
growth of both the clinical and laboratory, M. tuberculosis strains, at concentrations in the low micromolar range. Although
the activity of compound 3 was reduced in the clinical
strains compared to that of H37Rv, this was not unexpected as reduced
activity has been observed previously in these clinical strains (unpublished
data). It is very promising that inhibition was observed in these
clinical strains. An increase in the MIC observed in the Beijing strains
was likely to be due to phenotypic resistance mechanisms, such as
reduced permeability, which will be investigated further. These findings
highlight the need for the evaluation of novel compounds against different
lineages and clinically adapted strains. Novel drugs are needed for
TB treatment, and compound 3 is a starting point for
further development, particularly as the toxic effects of DNA binding
have been removed. This noncytotoxic and novel chemical scaffold can
be used to develop new antitubercular agents or as a chemical biology
tool to study antimicrobial resistance in M. tuberculosis.

Experimental Section
Chemistry
Solvents and reagents have been obtained
from several commercial sources, including Sigma-Aldrich, Fluorochem,
Alfa Aesar, and Fisher Scientific. Thin-layer chromatography analyses
were performed on plates coated with silica gel (Merck, F254 plates,
silica gel 60). The final plates were visualized under ultraviolet
radiation (UV) at either 254 or 365 nm. Manual flash chromatography
utilized in the purification of the crude of the reaction was performed
using silica gel as a stationary phase (silica gel from Merck, 230–400
mesh). The solvents were routinely evaporated under vacuum using an
RC-600 evaporating system (from KNF), equipped with an SC-920 G vacuum
pump (KNF). The final compounds, when thermally stabile, were dried
using a VacuumTherm (Thermo Scientific) vacuum oven overnight. Glassware
used was dried in a UN55 oven (Memmert) at 200 °C.

1H and 13C nuclei nuclear magnetic (NMR) analyses
were performed on a Spectrospin 400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker) equipped
with a SampleXpress (from Bruker) autosampler system, using deuterated
solvents for the preparation of the samples. The obtained spectra
were analyzed using Topspin 7.1 software (Bruker). The chemical shifts
were reported relative to trimethylsilane (TMS), used as a standard
(0.00 ppm). Signals were identified and described as singlet (s),
doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), or multiplets (m). Coupling
constants were reported in Hertz (Hz). LC–MS analyses were
performed on a Waters Alliance 2695 system (Waters), with elution
in gradient. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade solvents
were used as a mobile phase, while a Monolithic C18 50 × 4.60
mm2 column (Phenomenex) was used as a stationary phase.
The UV detection was performed using a Waters 2996 photoarray detector
(Waters). Mass spectra were collected in both ESI+ and ESI–
modes by a Waters QZ instrument (Waters) coupled to the HPLC system.

Alloc, THP protected pyrrolobenzodiazepine
core 2 (200 mg, 0.38 mmol, 1 equiv), and ciprofloxacin
ethyl ester 1 (1.1 equiv) were dissolved in dimethylformamide
(10 mL). EDCI (2 equiv) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (1.75 equiv) were
added to the solution, which was left under a magnetic stirrer overnight
at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction went
to completion after 15 hours and was monitored by LC–MS. Ethyl
acetate (30 mL) was added to the solution, and the organic phase was
washed with a NaHCO3 aqueous saturated solution (2 ×
10 mL), citric acid aqueous saturated solution (2 × 10 mL), and
brine (2 × 10 mL). The organic phase was collected, dried over
MgSO4, and evaporated under vacuum to give the crude of
reaction, which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel
(mobile phase: 95/5, DCM/MeOH, v/v), obtaining 150 mg of the protected
PBD–ciprofloxacin ethyl ester conjugate (3a).
The obtained product 3a was fully characterized using
NMR and MS spectroscopy (ESI). The protected compound 3a was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of dioxane/MeOH (6 mL) and underwent
basic hydrolysis, being treated with an aqueous solution of NaOH 0.1
M (excess). The reaction went to completion. The reaction mixture
was evaporated under vacuum, H20 (20 mL) was added to the
crude, and subsequently acidified until pH 2, treating with HCl of
a 0.1 M aqueous solution. The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl
acetate (3 × 10 mL) that was subsequently collected, dried over
MgSO4, and evaporated under vacuum to give the corresponding
protected PBD–ciprofloxacin derivative (120 mg). The obtained
compound (120 mg) was dissolved in DCM (3 mL) and treated with tetrakisPd(0)
triphenylphosphine (0.05 equiv) and pyrrolidine (1.2 equiv). The reaction
went to completion in 20 minutes, and the crude of reaction was evaporated
under vacuum and purified by column chromatography on silica gel (mobile
phase: DCM/MeOH, 93/7, v/v) to give the final PBD–ciprofloxacin
compound 3 (PBD–CIP) as a white solid (62 mg,
yield calculated on three steps: 37%).

Molecular Docking of the Compounds to Wild and Mutant Gyrase
A
M. tuberculosis gyrase A
structure was obtained by homology modeling using the Swiss Model
webserver. The sequence identity (SID) and similarity (SIM) of the
target with the template crystal structure of S. aureus gyrase A (PDB ID code 2XCS) were 55.83% and 0.45, respectively. The structure
was amended using Accelrys discovery studio and minimized using the
AMBER 16.0 package program. AutoDock SMINA was used for blind molecular
docking of ciprofloxacin and compound 3 to the homology
modeled minimized structure of gyrase A from M. tuberculosis to determine the best binding pocket. Blind molecular docking was
followed by GOLD to perform flexible molecular docking and determining
more precise and evaluated energies and scores by docking the compounds
into the SMINA identified binding pocket. The GOLD program calculates
a fitness score, which takes into account the ligand binding position
and the ability of the ligand to stabilize the complex. The fitness
score, ChemScore, was used to determine the best-docked pose for each
compound. For molecule docking of the mutant form of gyrase A, Ser84
was altered to Leu using PyMOL software, and the new structure of
gyraseA_S84L was minimized using Sybyl program. GOLD molecular docking
was performed on the minimized structure of the mutant enzyme, and
the ligand conformational flexibility along with the partial flexibility
of the protein was thoroughly examined by a genetic algorithm (GA).
The default parameters were selected (100 population sizes, 5 for
the number of islands, 100 000 number of operations, and 2
for the niche size) for each run, and the maximum number of runs was
set to 20 for each compound. The cutoff values of 4.0 Å for van
der Waals distance and 2.5 Å (dH–X) for hydrogen bonds
were employed.

Microbiological Evaluation
Bacterial Strains and Reagents
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis strains, H37Rv, 1192/015, and 08/00483E
(multidrug-resistant (MDR)), were used in the modified resazurin microtiter
assay (REMA) plate method. M. tuberculosis Beijing strains 1192/015 and 08/00483E were obtained from the PHE
National Mycobacterial Reference Laboratory.

Reagents used were
Middlebrook 7H9 medium (BD Difco), OADC supplemented with 0.5% glycerol
(24388.295, VWR Chemicals) and 0.2% Tween 80 (P1754, Sigma), CAMR
Mycobacterium medium MOD2 (CMM MOD2),30 ciprofloxacin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no. 33434), and 0.02% resazurin
solution (10 mg resazurin sodium salt (R7017, Sigma-Aldrich) in 50
mL phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Severn Biotech) containing 5%
Tween 80).31 All of the antibiotics were
dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich D2650) to a
stock concentration of 10 mg/mL.

Preparation of Bacterial Inocula
Bacterial strains
were grown in 50 mL of OADC-supplemented, Middlebrook 7H9 medium with
0.5% glycerol and 0.2% Tween 80 in vented Erlenmeyer flasks, shaken
at 37 °C for 5 days. Inoculum for the REMA method was prepared
to an OD540nm of 0.5, from Middlebrook 7H9 cultures by
diluting cells in CMM MOD2 medium.

Modified Resazurin Microtiter Assay (REMA) Plate Method
A modification of the REMA plate method previously described by Nateche
et al. in 2006 was used.32,33 A 10 mg/mL stock solution
of each antibiotic was prepared in DMSO. A twofold serial dilution
of each antibiotic stock solution was performed in CMM MOD2 medium.
The two antibiotics evaluated were ciprofloxacin (0.094–6.036
μM) and compound 3 (0.048–3.1 μM).
Each antibiotic concentration of 100 μL was added to six replicate
wells in a 96-well plate (734-1554, VWR). Three of the wells were
“drug-only”, and another three wells were “test
wells” used to assess the activity of the antibiotic. Bacterial
culture (10 μL) was added to the test wells to give a final
OD540nm of 0.05. Three further wells contained 100 μL
of medium and 10 μL of bacteria as “drug-free”
controls to confirm the growth of the bacteria in the absence of an
antibiotic. The drug-only controls allowed for confirmation that there
was an absence of colorimetric interference from the antibiotics.
Bacteria were diluted to an optical density (OD540nm) of
0.5, and 10 μL of the inoculum was added to each of the test
wells and the drug-free controls. Medium (10 μL) was added to
the drug-only wells. The plates were incubated for 7 days at 37 °C
while shaking at 200 rpm. Drug activity was assessed by adding 11
μL resazurin to each well of the 96-well plate and then incubating
the plate at room temperature for 6 hours. The optical density (OD570nm) was measured in each well. The OD570nm measurements
were converted to a percentage of the drug-free control; data were
expressed as a percentage of the growth without an antibiotic.

Statistical Analyses
The average OD570nm for each drug concentration was fitted to a sigmoidal curve using
the modified Gompertz function (y = A + Ce-e(B(x – M))), and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was identified
from the point of inflexion of the lower asymptote.27 This was applied to the mean of the OD570nm of
four biological repeats to produce a graphical representation for
each condition. An unpaired, two-tailed, Student’s t test was used to determine significance between biological
repeats.
