Tailoring the polymer melt rheology
and the chain relaxation dynamics
permits easy handling of polymer processing and enables broader range
of applications. Novel strategy to control the polymer melt rheology
and the chain relaxation dynamics was devised. A simple process for
molecular structural change in a polyamide (nylon 6) to easily generate
a long-chain branching in a controllable manner without forming a
network structure led to unusually large enhancements in the relaxation
dynamics. The zero shear viscosity of the polyamide has increased
more than 200 folds of linear chains viscosity, whereas the molar
mass change was ca. 1.6 times. Storage modulus and the loss modulus
at low frequency increased more than 104 and 103 times to those of neat polyamide without forming a network structure.
The rheological properties of the polymer (nylon 6) melts can be finely
tailored by this simple process to cover a broad range of applications.

Introduction
Most polymers synthesized by step polymerization
are known to have
low molar mass compared to other polymers synthesized by free radical
polymerization. Due to the low molar mass, their melts generally exhibit
quite distinctive rheological properties from the other polymers;
they have a wide Newtonian viscosity plateau over a wide range of
shear rates and the melt viscosity is quite low.1,2 The
consequence of this property is a lack of processibility, particularly
in extrusion process such as a blow molding process, due to a low
shear viscosity at low shear rates. Moreover, their weak strain hardening
gives rise to difficulties in processing operations in which elongational
properties dominate.2 The issue is then
how to control the rheological properties of those polymers to easily
meet the requirement for various processing conditions. One possible
method to cure the characteristic rheological properties is to change
the molar mass and structure of the molecules in a controllable manner
because the chain relaxation dynamics and rheological properties of
polymer melts are profoundly influenced by the molar mass, polymer
molecule’s structure, and ensuing molecular entanglements.

Entangled polymer melts can display a wide range of rheological
behaviors depending on the molecular interactions. Sufficiently entangled
polymer melts show a strong viscosity (η) increase with their
molar mass (M), η ∼ M3, compared to unentangled polymers (η ∼ M).3 Reptation theory with contour
length fluctuations and constraint-release effects predicts that the
shear viscosity of entangled linear polymer melts scales with the
molecular weight as M3.4.3 On the other hand, long-chain branching polymers, prepared
by reacting chain-end functional groups with a multifunctionalized
molecules, generally exhibit properties that differ significantly
from those of linear polymers, even with a low degree of branches.4,5 Dynamics of branched polymers can be described by a tube theory,
but they cannot reptate easily within the relaxation times of normal
linear polymers because of their central branch point.6 Instead, they renew their configurations and thus relax
stresses by contour length fluctuations of the arms. In this case,
the total stress after a step strain is proportional to the length
of the tube still unvisited by a chain end.7 Theoretical calculation of full relaxation spectrum by Pearson and
Helfand showed that the relaxation of branched chain molecules like
a star polymer or a H-polymer can be exponentially slower than those
of linear molecules due to their long arms.8 However, general star or H-polymer molecules of long chain length
have some problems in processing due to their extremely slow relaxation
and chain dynamics.5,8,9

In this study, we tried to solve those rheological problems of
polymers synthesized by the step polymerization method using a simple
method, i.e., to increase the molar mass by a linking agent that can
connect two chains in a linear matter first to double its molar mass
and then later generate 3- or 4-armed polymers in a controllable manner.
Here, we adopt a simple reactive extrusion to change the structure
of a polyamide (nylon 6) with a linking agent. The chain relaxation
dynamics were varied over a few orders of magnitude through the control
of the linking agent concentration. This is ascribed to the tailoring
of long-chain branching without a network structure (or a gel) generation
in the melt. The relaxation dynamics and the flow properties of a
polymer melt could undergo unusually large enhancements in a controllable
magnitude depending on the amount of the linking agent by the 3- or
4-armed star polymer molecules of which branching emanates from the
connected part of the molecules.

Results and Discussion
Early intention of a diepoxy (4,4′-di(2,3-epoxypropyloxy)phenyl
benzoate, abbreviated DEPPB) addition was to enhance the molar mass
of nylon 6 (Scheme 1a) by connecting two molecules through the additive molecule because
the molar mass increase would increase more chain entanglements. The
chemical structure of the reaction (a) product, an extended polyamide
6, in Scheme 1 could
be verified by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra
(Figure 1). 1H NMR spectra of neat KN171 and sample #6 containing DEPPB of which
the ratio between amine and epoxy groups was 1:2 were nearly identical.
However, the weak signal of aromatic protons of the extender (DEPPB)
appeared at 6.8–8.2 ppm in a spectrum of extended polyamide
6. The HSQC spectra of an extended polyamide 6 showed that all aromatic
protons were correlated with aromatic carbons and their signal was
attributed to CH (Figure 1a). Furthermore, chemical shift of E carbon (67.9 ppm) due
to the reaction between epoxide and diamine could be confirmed (Figure 1b), though the reaction
(b) of Scheme 1 could
not be identified because the signal of the tertiary amine was overlapped
with that of other amines.

(a) The reactive group molar
ratio is 1:1 (linking of two nylon 6 molecules). (b) The reactive
group molar ratio is greater than 1:1 (3- or 4-armed starlike polymer
formation).

Figure 2 shows the
melt viscosities for differently modified nylon 6 as a function of
frequency. There is a broad Newtonian plateau of low viscosity for
neat nylon 6 melt at the frequencies below 100 rad/s, above which
it exhibits a weak shear thinning. Modified nylon 6 reveals a different
trend as the linking agent was added. The shear thinning region widens
and the absolute value of the melt viscosity, η, at low frequencies
increases significantly. When the specimen had more molar amount of
epoxy group than the amine group of nylon 6 (over 1:1 ratio), the
melt viscosities increased substantially higher than that of neat
nylon 6. Surprisingly, there is no apparent Newtonian plateau for
these samples, but only a strong shear-thinning behavior is observed
throughout the whole frequency range. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first observation that neat nylon 6 melt without any other
fillers shows only shear thinning behavior without the appearance
of the Newtonian plateau in the frequency range from 0.1 to 500 rad/s.
The shear thinning behavior of the modified nylon 6 melt in Figure 2 could be well described
by the simple Carreau equation with Cox–Merz rule, η(γ)/η0 ≈ (1 + (γτn)2)(n−1)/2, where η0 is the zero shear rate viscosity, γ is the shear rate,
and τn is the characteristic time.11 The zero shear rate viscosity obtained from
the Carreau model (Table 1) increased with the added DEPPB concentration. After reaching
the peak of 1.09 × 105 Pa s for DEPPB(2), it decreased
to 9.07 × 104 Pa s for DEPPB(2.25). The melt viscosity
at the peak was more than 200 times larger than that of the pure nylon
6 melt.

The intrinsic
viscosity was measured to calculate the molar mass
using the Mark–Houwink equation (Table 1).12 Like the
melt viscosity, the viscosity average molar mass reached the maximum
when the molar ratio of the reactive functional groups was 2 (DEPPB(2)),
beyond which it decreased. It should be noted that the viscosity average
molar mass of DEPPB(2) was ca 1.6 times of pure nylon 6. For the linear
polymer chains, this slight molar mass change (1.6 times) cannot enhance
the melt viscosity more than 5 times of pure nylon 6, assuming them
to follow the 3.4 power-law (η ∼ M3.4).6 Hence, remarkable increase
in the melt viscosity of DEPPB(2) with a strong shear thinning without
the Newtonian plateau cannot be reconciled with the increase in the
linear molar mass by the linking agent.

Huge increase in the
melt viscosity may hint the occurrence of
the cross-linking reaction that DEPPB molecules trigger to form a
gel-like structure. However, the melt viscosity of other samples containing
more DEPPB than DEPPB(2) exhibited reductions in the melt viscosity
(Figure 2). Hence,
it cannot be reconciled within the frame work of cross-linking reactions
because more DEPPB addition definitely incurs more cross-linking reaction,
which results in the higher melt viscosity. More importantly, three
dimensionally cross-linked polymers are incapable of macroscopic viscous
flow because, at moderate level, the cross-links prevent the network
chains from flowing past one another.12 When the first network molecule is formed in a nonlinear polymer
networks, it encompasses the whole reactant mixture, which instantly
becomes immobilized: this corresponds to the gel point.4,7 However, the present reacted extrudates can be reprocessed many
times without showing any signs of solidification in extrudates (Figure 3). The extrudates
look like normal nylon 6 pellets. If cross-linking reaction has happened,
the extrudates should be in the form of a powder or display anomalous
topology. Under the observation of optical microscope, all specimen
films became transparent above the melt temperature of nylon 6 (ca.
240 °C). Another point excluding the possibility of gelation
is that the starting monomers should have functionality of three or
higher to form the complex network structure.12,16 To proceed the cross-linking reaction, the reacting polymers should
have diamine groups, but the nylon 6 molecules have monoamine group
at the chain end and the diepoxides have the functionality of two.
The other chain end group of nylon 6 is the initiator of ε-caprolactam
polymerization. Thus, they cannot cause any cross-linking reaction
at all.18 Also, the light-scattering analysis
of the polymer solution did not detect any insoluble particles in
the formic acid. The consequence of all these observations is that
the cross-linking reaction or gelation could not be the reason for
the strong shear thinning and unexpected high melt viscosity at low
shear rates.

Similar drastic changes can be
observed in the dynamic moduli (storage
modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″)) in Figure 4. The storage modulus is in phase with the deformation, whereas the
loss modulus is out of phase with the deformation.4 In non-cross-linked linear polymer melts, G′ is expected to be proportional to ω2 and G″ to ω at low frequency, showing the linear
viscoelastic (LVE) behavior.7 The flow
of nylon 6 melt follows this behavior, but modified nylon 6 melts
exhibit large deviations from the linear viscoelastic behavior. The
power-law dependence of G′ and G″ on the frequency becomes monotonically weaker with the addition
of the linking agent. The significance of this behavior is that the
dynamics steadily changes from the LVE behavior to nonlinear viscoelastic
behavior. The G′ value of DEPPB(2) at low
frequency shows an increase of almost 4 order (104 times)
higher than that of nylon 6, whereas G″ value
of the same sample exhibits ca. 3 order (103 times) increase.
After DEPPB (2), G′ and G″ values decreased similarly to the melt viscosity change.
The interaction frequency (ωc) of the G′ and the G″ provides the chains’
relaxation time, τ = 1/ωc.7 The relaxation time of the modified melts was the longest
for DEPPB(2) (≈ca. 15 s). Hence, the molecules relax most slowly
for the sample that displays the maximum zero-shear rate viscosity.

modulus and (b) loss modulus of neat nylon 6 and modified
nylon 6. (c) Comparison of storage modulus and loss modulus of nylon

The rheological properties were measured at 250 °C.

Less than 1.6 times molar mass change for DEPPB(2)
cannot describe
the whole rheological property changes (Table 1 and Figures 2 and 4). Possible topological
structure like a gel was also excluded due to the downturn of the
viscosity and the relaxation time with more addition of DEPPB after
DEPPB(2). The other possible and plausible topological structure suitable
for the explanation of all the rheological behaviors is the branching
structure.9,13 DEPPB can react with the amine end groups
of two nylon 6 molecules through the chain-linking reaction (Scheme 1a). Connecting two
nylon 6 molecules into one doubles the molar mass which can generate
more entanglements between chains and induce higher viscosity because
of slow relaxation. But, it turns out that further reaction of the
secondary amine after the primary amine reaction can be proceeded
to produce 3- or 4-armed (H-type) star polymers. The chemical reaction
between the epoxy group of DEPPB and primary amine group of nylon
6 is plausibly proceeded first as in Scheme 1a. The most commonly observed reaction mechanism
between an epoxy group and an amine group is autocatalytic, where
the epoxy ring opens to form a hydroxyl group, which is able to catalyze
further the amine-epoxy reactions.10 After
the first reaction, the secondary amine can further react with other
epoxy groups to form a three- or four-armed (H-shape) chains (reaction
(b) of Scheme 1). Due
to the steric hindrance and low reactivity, amide groups of nylon
6 chains cannot undergo branch-forming reaction as actively as the
secondary amine group of the linking agent, which generates three-
or four-armed (H-shape) star polymers (reaction (b) of Scheme 1). If 4-armed (H-shape) chains
are mainly produced in the extruder, the reacting functional group
ratio (epoxy to amine) is simply calculated as 1.5 for four-armed
(H) polymers. The data show the highest melt viscosity for DEPPB (2),
which is ascribable to some dangling DEPPB moiety rather than connecting
two chains and forming branches.

The branched chains have longer
relaxation times to show complex
thermorheological behavior in which time−temperature superposition
fails.9,13 One way of distinguishing the complex thermorheological
behavior from the linear chain’s behavior is to plot the phase
angle (δ) of the loss tangent (tan δ = G″/G′) versus the absolute
value of the complex modulus, |G*(ω)|, called
the van Gurp–Palmen (vGP) plot.14 The van Gurp–Palmen plot was found to be quite useful to
characterize different architecture and topology such as polydispersity
of linear polymers, long chain branching (LCB), gelation, and filler
interaction in nanocomposites.15−17 To sketch the data of different
samples directly in one figure regardless of their chemical constitution
or chemical topology, so-called reduced van Gurp–Palmen (rvGP)
plot was adopted to plot the phase angle (δ) versus the reduced
absolute value of the complex modulus, |G*(ω)|/GN0, where GN0 is the plateau modulus. Here, the plateau modulus, GN0, was determined by the crossover
modulus-based method (GN0 = Gc′ = Gc″
at angular frequency of ω = ωc).20 Keunings et al. compared several methods to
determine the plateau modulus, GN0.20 According to their analysis,
because G″ sometimes has no maximum nor a
minimum when the MWD is very broad and/or the MW very low, especially
if the polymer is semicrystalline, other methods are not applicable
to determine the plateau modulus. Though the crossover modulus-based
method underestimates a little bit for polyolefin polymers, it is
useful for the semicrystalline polycondensates and ring-opening polymers,
e.g., poly (caprolactam) (Ny 6), poly(hexamethylene adipamide) (Ny
66).20 The x-axis in the
rvGP plot is in logarithmic scale, which reduces the curve movement
in the horizontal direction. Thus, the qualitative nature of the rvGP
plot is not remarkably affected. The rvGP plot rather than vGP plot
was used in this study because it turned out to be quite useful to
distinguish the long-chain branching topology.17−19

Polymers
with a linear topology (linear molecules) have a unique
course of a curve in the rvGP plot like those presented in Figure 4d. It is apparent
from the rvGP plot and the data in Table 1 that nylon 6 mixtures with DEPPB up to 0.4
functional group molar ratio exhibit similar rheological behavior
(simple fluids of linear polymers), although the curves shifted downward
because of increased molar mass and molecular weight distribution.15−17 Other samples containing more DEPPB molecules than DEPPB(1) show
a totally different behavior; the angle decreased rapidly and then
became almost flat. This is rheologically complex fluid behavior by
the long-chain branching or gelation.4,16 Rapid decrease
is due to the enhancement of elasticity. The gelation effect is excluded
again because, if this is due to the gelation (cross-linking), the
angle |δ| should go down further.17 Instead, there appears a plateau-like flat region with the increase
of modulus, which indicates that the melts are strongly viscoelastic
but not dominantly elastic like a gel.17−19 δ vs |G*(ω)|/GN0 does
exhibit significant differences with the modifier (DEPPB) content,
reflecting the influence of the branches on the relaxation spectrum.
The more DEPPB is added, the stronger is the deviation from the curve
of the linear chains. This indicates the generation of more branched
molecules. However, excessive modifier forms dangling chains rather
than connecting two nylon 6 chains or forming branched molecules,
whose relaxation spectrum decreases due to the less branched molecules.

Moving from high to low modulus values, the phase angle δ
in the rvGP plot rises to reach the limiting value at the plateau
modulus, GN0.17 This characteristic curvature is found for semicrystalline
linear polymers.18 For amorphous polymers
like polystyrene or poly(methyl methacrylate), the phase angle δ
drops, passes a minimum, rises again, moves through an inflection
point, and fully approaches its limiting value of 90° while moving from high to low modulus values.17 For DEPPB(1.25) sample, the δ(|G*(ω)|/GN0) curve differs
significantly from that of the linear samples and is the same for
all other samples containing more DEPPB than DEPPB(1.25). Their shapes
cannot be superposed to make a master curve. In the case of thermorheologically
complex fluids, G′(ω) as well as G″(ω) cannot be superimposed, as not all relaxation
times have the same temperature dependence, whereas thermorheologically
simple fluids can form a master curve due to the same temperature
dependence of all the relaxation times.4,7 As the DEPPB
amount increases, the δ value decreases rapidly with increasing
|G*(ω)|/GN0 to reach a flat region. This behavior is different from that
of a gel in the rvGP plot. The angle δ of a gel increases, passes
through the maximum, and then decreases.19 The relaxation behavior of long-chain branching (LCB) molecules
are known to be similar to that of a gel network because LCBs are
entangled in the melt state, which is similar to that of a physical
gel.21 However, rvGP plot differentiate
the LCB behavior from that of a gel. This feature agrees with the
other branched polymer’s behavior; δ curves for DEPPB(1.25)
to DEPPB(2) samples are shifted downward in comparison to the curve
for linear samples, demonstrating the influence of such chain branching.

In polymer systems of long-chain branches, the relaxation times
are significantly increased due to the chain entanglements of the
branches.7 The melt viscosity of a branched
polymer grows exponentially with the number of entanglements per arm
(η0 ∼ (Ma/Me)3/2 exp(νMa/Me), where Ma is the arm’s molecular weight, Me is the entanglement molecular weight, and ν is
the constant13) and is independent of the
number of arms, f (3 or 4 gave the same results9). The tube model gives ν value of 15:8,
but the dynamic dilution of effective entanglement gives a smaller
value by a factor of 3, which was in good agreement with the reported
data.13 Using the zero shear rate viscosity
from the Carreau model and the viscosity average molar mass gives
ν value of 0.32 ± 0.03 for the samples showing high shear
thinning behavior (DEPPB(1.25), DEPPB(2), and DEPPB(2.25) in Figure 2 and Figure 4). This is smaller than the
experimental data of Fetters et al.9 (ν
was 0.47), possibly due to incomplete branching structure, wide polydispersity
of nylon 6 and the use of the viscosity average molar mass rather
than the weight average molar mass.

The chain relaxation is
also reflected in the glass transition
temperature (Tg). Addition of the linking
agent into the neat nylon 6 melts results in the increase in Tg due to the restriction of chain relaxation
by chain branching.7Figure 5a shows the glass transition temperature
of modified nylon 6 samples having a higher Tg than that of neat nylon 6. DEPPB(2.25) shows a downward shift,
indicating that it is not because of the gelation (or cross-linking)
of the polymers.16 The topology variation
does not hamper chain ordering in the cooling process (crystallization)
because branches do not take part in the same folding sheet of nylon
6, or they belong to other folding sheet.22 In a system that undergoes significant structural topology change
in the crystal lattice, the melt dynamics can display a complex rheological
behavior. However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement in Figure 5b reveals that there
is no effect of chain branching on the crystal lattice. The pair of
peaks at 2θ = 20.5 and 24° are distinctive features of
the α-plane in nylon 6.22 They are
the reflections from the (020) and (002) planes.22,23 The degree of crystallinity determined using the X-ray peaks was
ca 39.5% for neat nylon 6 and 39 (±0.5%) for other modified ones.

almost the same crystallinity of ca. 39.5% for neat nylon 6 and 39
(+0.5%) for other modified ones.

Conclusions
The chain relaxation dynamics variation over
a few orders of magnitude
could be easily controlled by the tailoring of chains topology in
the melt through the addition of proper amount of the linking agent.
A simple process for molecular structural change to easily generate
a long chain branching in a controllable manner without forming a
network structure was devised on the basis of the secondary amine
reaction. The relaxation dynamics and the rheological properties of
a polymer melt can undergo unusually large enhancements by the probable
generation of 3- or 4-armed (H) star polymer molecules, whose branching
emanates from the linking molecules. The zero shear viscosity increased
more than 200 times the linear chains viscosity. Storage modulus and
the loss modulus at low frequency increased more than 104 and 103 times that of that of neat polyamides without
forming a network structure. These findings overcome the rheological
barrier of polyamide melts to open up new possibilities for wider
applications.

Experimental Section
As a linking
agent, diepoxy (4,4′-di(2,3-epoxypropyloxy)phenyl
benzoate, shortly DEPPB) was synthesized with the following chemical
structure.

DEPPB was synthesized through the following
procedure. (1) (4,4′-Dihydroxyphenyl
benzoate) (DHPB) was synthesized first. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (60
g, 0.43 mol) and NaOH (38 g, 0.96 mol) were added to 900 mL of water
and the mixture stirred for 10 min at 5 °C. Ethylchloroformate
(54 g, 0.5 mol) was added dropwise into the solution and then stirred
for 10 min. A 2N HCl solution (500 mL) was poured into the solution
and the resulting white precipitate was filtered and washed with water
several times. The solid product was recrystallized from acetone and
white needle-like crystals were obtained. These crystals and a few
drops of N,N-dimethylformamide were
poured into thionyl chloride and boiled for 1 h. The excess thionyl
chloride was evaporated under vacuum at 10–2 mmHg.
The product was dissolved in 300 mL of CH2Cl2 and the solution was added dropwise to a tetrahydrofuran solution
containing hydroquinone (55 g, 0.5 mol) and pyridine (40 mL, 0.5 mol).
After reaction for 12 h at room temperature, the solution was precipitated
in 2N NaOH solution. After filtration, the precipitate was washed
with excess water and then dissolved in ethanol. A 2N NaOH solution
and acetic acid were added successively to the ethanol solution. After
stirring for 2 h, ethanol was evaporated and the product washed with
water and then recrystallized from methylcellulose acetate. The yield
was 68% (67 g). (2) A mixture of DHPB (33 g, 0.2 mol), 3-bromopropene
(26 mL, 0.30 mol), and K2CO3 (70 g, 0.5 mol)
was added to 400 mL of acetone and then boiled for 24 h. The solid
was filtered and acetone was evaporated for 24 h. The remaining solid
was washed successively with 5% Na2CO3 solution,
excess water, and 200 mL of cold ethanol. After drying, a white powder
was obtained, which was recrystallized from acetonitrile/isopropanol
(1:1). The yield was 74% (46 g). (3) Diallyl monomer (31 g, 0.1 mol)
from step 2 was oxidized with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid and the product
recrystallized from acetonitrille/isopropanol (1:1). The yield was
75% (25 g). The melting temperature (Tm) of the product was found to be 119 °C. 1H NMR (CDCl3): 2.79 (2H, dd, CH2 of epoxy), 2.92 (2H, dd, CH2 of epoxy), 3.39 (2H,m, CH of epoxy), 3.94 (CH2 of glycidyl), 4.27 (CH2 of glycidyl), 7.02 (4H, d, aromatic),
8.15 (2H,d, aromatic). IR (KBR pellet): 921 cm–1 (oxirane), 1256 cm–1 (−C–O−),
1728 cm–1 (carbonyl).

Nylon 6 was a Kolon
product (KN171, Korea). The weight average
molar mass was found to be 8.5 × 104 g/mol with a
polydispersity index of 3.5. This molar mass was much higher than Me of nylon 6 (2233 g mol–1).4 Nylon 6 pellets and DEPPB powder were
dried in a vacuum oven at 100 and 80 °C, respectively, for 24
h. The DEPPB powder was then premixed in a container with dried nylon
6 pellets at a predetermined weight ratio. Finally, the mixture was
blended in a twin screw extruder (PRISM) at 280 °C. The extrudates
were pelletized to be used for further characterization. All the extrudates
showed the same shape (cylindrical rod) as the nylon 6 extrudates,
as shown later, which means no structural variation such as gellation
(or cross-linking) happened. If gellation or cross-linking occurred,
the extrudates come out as a brittle powder.

Fourier transform
infrared spectra were obtained using a Bruker
200 spectrometer (IF 66) with an average of 200 scans at a resolution
of 4 cm–1. The NMR samples were prepared by dissolving
the pellets in formic acid-d2 with heating.
Formic acid was used as both solvent and internal standard (1H, 13C). 1H and 13C heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra were collected on an 850
MHz Bruker AVANCE HD III spectrometer at the NCIRF at Seoul National
University. The XRD patterns for the prepared specimens were recorded
on a Rigaku D/max 3C diffractometer using a filtered Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15406 nm). The diffractometer was operated at 40 kV and
40 mA. The XRD data were collected from 10 to 35° (2θ)
in a fixed time mode with a step interval of 0.02° (2θ).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Mettler DSC 30) measurements
were performed under nitrogen atmosphere. The rheological properties
were measured at 250 °C with a UDS200 (Physica, Germany) rheometer
on which 25 mm diameter cone and plate were mounted. The frequency
range was set at 0.1–500 rad/s, and the applied strain was
5%. Before the measurement, the samples were prepared with a compression
molder at 280 °C. The measurements were carried out under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The viscosity molar mass was calculated by the Mark–Houwink
equation of [η] = k[M]a with k = 0.0226 and a = 0.82,
where [η] is the intrinsic viscosity, which was measured using
an Ubelhode viscometer at 25 °C.13 Formic acid (85%) was used as a solvent.
