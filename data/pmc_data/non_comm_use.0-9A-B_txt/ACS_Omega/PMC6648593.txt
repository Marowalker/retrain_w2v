stability of organic cappings on hexagonal NaYF4:Ln3+ upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is crucial for
their luminescence efficiency in aqueous solutions. The capping removal
quickens as the acidity of the medium increases. We demonstrate here
that polysulfonates, namely poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate)
(PAMPS) and poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS), remain anchored
to the surface of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/Tm3 UCNPs even at a pH as low as 2 due to strong acidity
of the sulfonate anchoring groups (pKa of ca. −3). Bare UCNPs progressively disintegrate into their
compositional F–, Na+, Y3+, and Ln3+ ions. Their disintegration is particularly
worrying in highly diluted dispersions of nanoparticles because both
the lanthanide ions and/or the bare UCNPs can cause undesirable interference
in a chemical or biological environment. Remarkably, the UC@PSS nanohybrid
is particularly chemically stable, exhibiting an amazingly low release
of Y3+ and Ln3+ ions for up to 96 h in highly
diluted water dispersions (10 μg/mL). Additional advantages
of the use of PSS as capping layer are its biocompatibility and its
high dispersibility in water, together with easy further functionalization
of the UCNP@PSS nanohybrids.

==== Body
Introduction
Lanthanide-doped upconversion
nanoparticles (UCNPs) consist of
an inert crystalline matrix doped with at least two types of trivalent
lanthanide ions (Ln), such as Yb3+ and Er3+,
one of which absorbs near-infrared (NIR) light and transfers it to
the other, which emits photons of higher energy than those absorbed.1,2 Fluorine-containing matrices are the most common as they have low
phonon energies, and those with a hexagonal phase (β) are more
thermodynamically stable than those with a cubic phase (α).
For example, β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/Tm3+ UCNPs are colorless and, after NIR-excitation with
a low-power continuous-wave diode laser, can produce large anti-Stokes
shifted (red and green) narrow-band fluorescence emissions and even
NIR-to-NIR upconversion, which makes deep-tissue imaging possible.
These features, together with the fact that they do not undergo photobleaching
or photoblinking and in view of their very low toxicity, make UCNPs
of high relevance in biological and technological applications.

However, disintegration of α- and β-NaYF4:Ln
UCNPs in water has recently been reported,3 especially in highly diluted nanoparticle suspensions.4,5 As they progressively disintegrate, their upconversion luminescence
intensity usually decreases due to the loss of active Ln ions from
the host matrix, and their toxicity increases due to the release of
F–, Ln3+, and Y3+ ions. The
disintegration of NaYF4:Ln UCNPs leads to the release of
compositional ions, some of which are (cyto)toxic (particularly, fluoride
ions).6 In addition, toxicology studies
on rats have shown that lanthanide chlorides such as that of ytterbium
tend to accumulate in the liver, bones, and spleen; in the liver,
they can interact with proteins, affecting enzyme activity and physiological
function.7

The disintegration of
these UCNPs is concentration- and pH-dependent.
In concentrated suspensions, equilibrium is achieved with minimal
disintegration, and the change in the luminescence intensity is also
negligible, whereas in diluted (μM) samples, the nanoparticles
can disintegrate almost completely, thereby reaching the solubility
equilibrium. In terms of the acidity of the medium, pristine UCNPs
(i.e., oleate-capped UCNPs) are unstable in acidic physiological fluids
such as lysosomes (pH ca. 4.5–5.0).8 It has to be taken into account that at pH = 4, carboxylate-capped
UCNPs lose their protected capping; in fact, bare UCNPs can be prepared
by treatment of the NPs with HCl at pH 4, which protonates the oleate
ligand resulting in the release of oleic acid.9 This capping removal does not only apply to carboxylate ligands
but also to many other types of ligands.

Soukka et al.4 have recently put forward
a solution to prevent the disintegration of UCNPs in highly diluted
water dispersions (few micrograms per milliliter); their solution
is made by adding fluoride ions, which have a high impact on the solubility
equilibrium, eventually decelerating the disintegration of poly(acrylic
acid)-capped UCNPs. Unfortunately, this strategy needs a considerably
high concentration (mM) of fluoride, which, from the point of view
of their use in live cells, is not advisable due to its (cyto)toxicity.10

The requirement of ligands to remain on
the nanoparticle surface
in a broad range of pH values, and particularly, at low pH values
(such as that of stomach acid, which is close to 2), is that they
possess strongly ionizable anchoring groups. These groups may help
modulate the extent to which the nanoparticle is absorbed in the organism
(e.g., the gastrointestinal tract) and its bioavailability (e.g.,
nanoparticle ionization decreases absorption).13 An organic shell completely covering and strongly anchored
to the UCNP surface might prevent undesirable interference in biological
environments (interactions with different blood components or any
biological fluids, formation of a protein corona).11,12

Xia et al. demonstrated that a multichelating phosphonate
coating
(ethylenediamine tetra(methylene phosphonate), EDTMP) can prevent
the disintegration in water of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ NPs (200 μg NP/mL), whereas UCNPs capped with monophosphonates
and citrate are drastically damaged. These facts can be attributed
to the strong coordination of EDTMP to the UCNP surface as a consequence
of the affinity of the phosphonate group to the cations at the surface,
combined with the hexadentate binding of the ligand by means of its
four phosphonates and two amine groups. The EDTMP-capped NPs showed
a high resistance to disintegration when incubated in phagolysosomal
simulated fluid (pH 4.5) for 24 h. It is worth mentioning that these
studies were performed with relatively high concentrations of NPs.14

Many applications of UCNPs require that
the NPs possess an organic
capping that (i) provides them with high dispersibility in water,
(ii) protects them from disintegrating in water at neutral pH and/or
acid media, (iii) makes their further functionalization possible and/or
impedes the UCNPs from causing any undesirable interference in the
(chemical or cellular) environment, and (iv) is biocompatible.

With the aim of obtaining more stable UCNPs in water, we focused
on coating the UCNP surface with multichelating, strongly acidic ligands,
specifically, polysulfonates. The sulfonic group is a strong acid
(pKa of ca. −3) which is virtually
ionized throughout the entire range of pH values; the sulfonate group
has three potential coordination sites and can be effectively grafted
to the UCNP surface.15

We demonstrate
here that polysulfonates, such as polystyrene sulfonate
(PSS), remain anchored to the surface of NaYF4:Ln3+ UCNPs even at pH of ca. 2 and that highly diluted water dispersions
of the UCNP@PSS nanohybrid (10 μg/mL) show an amazingly low
release of Y3+ and Ln3+ ions for up to 96 h.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of the Polymer-Capped
UCNPs
First, different organic ligands with functional groups
able to
coordinate Ln3+ ions, specifically, phosphate, sulfonate,
and even fluoride,i,16−22 were used for coating the UCNP surface with the purpose of comparing
the resistance to acids of the corresponding capping under a strong
acid medium (pH of ca. 2). Two types of upconversion nanoparticles
(UCNPs), namely NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and
NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+, were synthesized
by thermal decomposition with oleic acid and 1-octadecene at high
temperature following a slightly modified well-known protocol. A batch
of oleate-capped β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ (UCEr@OA) and two different batches of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ (UCTm1@OA and
UCTm2@OA) were used for the studies reported here.23 Experimental details, X-ray diffraction (XRD)
data, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, size distribution
histograms, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
analyses can be found in the Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2 and Table S1). TEM images showed that UCTm1@OA, UCTm2@OA, and UCEr@OA NPs were
uniform hexagonal prisms, and their average sizes were (22.7 ±
0.9) × (20.3 ± 1.0) nm, (32.9 ± 1.9) × (22.4 ±
2.2) nm, and (46.7 ± 1.8) × (28.6 ± 1.4) nm, respectively.

Next, bare UCNPs were prepared by treatment of the oleate-capped
NPs either with HCl at pH 4 or by addition of NOBF4 to
lead to UCLn@BF4.24,25 The low binding
affinity of the BF4– anion to the UCNP
surface together with the strong coordination capability of the Ln3+ ions makes the secondary surface modification possible.
Then, the as-prepared bare UCNPs were reacted with the selected ligands,
namely (i) poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate) (PAMPS),
(ii) poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) with an Mw of 70000, (iii) mPEG5K-phosphate (PEGP), and (iv) 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-decanol (PFD) (Figure 1), to afford UCLn@PAMPS, UCLn@PSS, UCLn@PEGP, and UCLn@PFD NPs, respectively
(see the Materials and Methods section for
further details).

Figure 1 Scheme of the synthetic procedure used for building the
coated
upconversion nanoparticles (UCLn@PAMPS, UCLn@PSS, UCLn@PEGP, and UCLn@PFD) and structure
of the ligands: poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate) (PAMPS);
polystyrene sulfonate (PSS); mPEG5K-phosphate (PEGP); and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-decanol (PFD).

The successful coating of the UCLn surface with
PAMPS,
PSS, PEGP, and PFD was corroborated by HRTEM, FTIR (Figures 2 and 3), and TGA (Figure S3–S5 in the Supporting Information). Thus, Figure 2 shows high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of representative
samples of the four coated UCTm NPs where the presence
of an organic layer can be observed around the surface of the inorganic
NPs (see Figure S6 for coated UCEr NPs). The thickness of the capping was 2.5 ± 0.1 nm in the
case of UCTm@PAMPS, 1.6 ± 0.3 nm for UCTm@PSS, and 2.2 ± 0.3 nm for UCTm@PEGP. The thinner
capping (ca. 0.7 nm ± 0.3 nm) of the UCTm@PFD NPs
is consistent with the smaller size of the perfluoroalkanol ligand.
As expected, the nanoparticle sizes after surface functionalization
remained identical to that of the parent UCLn NP.

(left) and after (right) acid treatment.

The FTIR spectrum of the samples (see Figure 3, left) clearly showed the
characteristic signals of each ligand coating the UCLn surface;
briefly,( i) the C–H stretching vibration around 2880 cm–1 in all of them, (ii) the C–O stretching vibration
at 1110 cm–1 associated with the backbone of the
PEG chains and the vibration at ca. 1240 cm–1 typical
of P=O in PEGP, (iii) the two bands centered at ca. 1220 and
1045 cm–1, which correspond to the stretching vibration
(asymmetric and symmetric, respectively) of the S=O groups
in the sulfonated polymers, and the bands at ca. 1700 cm–1 attributed to C=O of the amide in PAMPS, and (iv) the multiple
strong bands in the range of 1350–1100 cm–1 assigned to C–F stretching modes of the perfluoroalkyl chain
of PFD.26 In addition, the comparison between
the spectra of the ligand-coated UCNPs and that of the corresponding
ligand (not shown) evidenced the effect of the anchoring to the NP
surface on the ligand vibrations, for example, fewer bands in the
1550 to 1000 cm–1 region due to the interaction
of fluorine atoms with the UCNP surface, specifically with Y3+ and/or Ln3+ ions.

In fact, lanthanide shift reagents
have been applied to the study
of alkyl fluorides by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Important findings
are that the chemical shift induced by Yb3+ shift reagents
decreases as the distance from the fluorine atom to the observed nucleus
increases, and the resolution of the shifted resonances is poor for
the nucleus closest to the fluorine center.20 These shifts have been attributed to the formation of fluorine-coordinated
lanthanide complexes. 19F-NMR spectra of the ligand and
UCLn@PFD were recorded in deuterated-methanol (see Figure S7) because the 19F-NMR spectra
can be useful to determine the type of anchoring of PFD to the NP
surface (via multidentate chelation or an active functional group
located at the end of the chain, termed brush-like interaction). Both
spectra showed seven bands at −82.85, −115.15, −123.15,
−123.40, −124.20, −125.25, and −127.75
ppm; the most significant difference between them was that the multiplet
at −82.85 ppm in PFD, assigned to CF3, turned into
a broad band in UCLn@PFD. This is consistent with the interaction
of PFD with the NP surface via the CF3 group, although
from the negligible changes in the chemical shifts of the ligand,
it can be inferred that this interaction is weak.

Thermogravimetric
analyses (TGA) of the UCLn@ligand
NPs, namely UCLn@PAMPS, UCLn@PSS, UCLn@PEGP, and UCLn@PFD NPs, were carried out to determine
the presence and amount of ligand bound to the nanoparticle surface
(see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). A weight loss of ca. 10 wt % was observed at temperatures below
750 °C for the four of them, and it can be attributed to the
organic capping.

The emission spectra (λex =
975 nm) of UCTm1@PAMPS, UCTm1@PSS, UCTm2@PEGP, and
UCTm1@PFD NPs, as well as those of UCEr@PAMPS
and UCEr@PSS, are shown in Figure S8 (see the Supporting Information). The
UCTm NPs showed the typical Tm3+ emission bands:
four of them below 500 nm [1I6 → 3F4 (at 345 nm),1D2 → 3H6 (at 368 nm),1D2 → 3F4 (at 450 nm), and 1G4 → 3H6 (at 475 nm) transitions] and other three bands
at 650, 700, and 800 nm. In the case of the UCEr NPs, the
three more intense emission bands can be observed in the green spectral
region centered at λem at 525 (2H11/2/4I15/2 transition) and 545 nm (4S3/2/4I15/2 transition) and
in the red spectral region centered at λem at 660
nm (4F9/2/4I15/2 transition).

As stated before, our purpose was to evaluate the efficiency of
different ligands to protect the UCLn surface even in a
highly acidic aqueous medium as low as pH 2. It is equally important
to prevent the disintegration of UCLn in highly diluted
water dispersions (few micrograms per milliliter). Both occurrences,
the loss of the organic capping and the disintegration of the inorganic
core, can cause undesirable interference in a chemical or biological
environment. The next two sections are devoted to presenting and discussing
the results after acid treatment of the four coated UCLn NPs as well as the extraordinary chemical and photophysical stability
of the sulfonate-coated NPs in water.

Stability of the Polymer
Capping of UCLn in Strongly
Acidic Media
Each coated UCLn was dispersed in
milliQ-water, and the pH of the colloidal dispersion was measured
at room temperature. Then, the sample was acidified (see the Materials and Methods section) with HCl solution
down to pH 2, and its emission was measured after 12 h (see Supporting Information, Figures S9 and S10).
Next, the sample was centrifuged and washed with milliQ-water, eventually
obtaining a solid, which was analyzed by FTIR. Figure 3 (right) shows the FTIR spectra after acid
treatment and reveals that only those cappings with sulfonate groups
remain anchored to the surface of the UCLn NPs, that is,
UCTm@PAMPS and UCTm@PSS, while no capping was
then distinguished for UCTm@PEGP and UCTm@PFD
(see Figure S11 for the UCEr nanohybrids). Figure 4 shows HRTEM images of UCEr@PSS and UCEr@PEGP
captured after acid treatment compared to those before such treatment
(see Figure S12 for other samples). The
fact that the sulfonated ligands remained anchored to the UCNP surface
in strong acid medium is relevant from the point of view of UCNP applications,
because the maintenance of the organic capping is crucial for its
performance. Remarkably, polysulfonate-capped UCLn were
emissive at acidic pH values (Figure S13). The failure of UCLn@PEGP and UCLn@PFD to
maintain the capping under strong acid media can be attributed to
acid-induced weakening of the coordination of the ligand to the NP
surface (see Footnote ii for UCLn@PFD).27,28

images of UCEr@PSS (top) and UCEr@PEGP (bottom),
before (left) and after (center) acid treatment;
expanded image of the nanoparticles is shown in the red square in
the center images (right).

The change in the NP surface charge as a consequence of the
acid
treatment was consistent with the variation of the zeta potential
of the NPs (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). Before and after acid treatment, UCLn and UCLn@BF4 show positive values (≈19 mV), whereas those
of UCLn@PSS and UCLn@PAMPS are negative (≈−31
and −26 mV, respectively, due to the anionic polymers). However,
UCLn@PEGP and UCLn@PFD show either slightly
negative (≈−3 mV) or slightly positive (≈11 mV)
zeta potential values, respectively, before acid treatment (dispersed
in milliQ-water), but their zeta potential was similar to that of
the bare UCLn after acid treatment (see Table S3), which evidences the removal of their capping ligand.
Indeed, DLS showed no sign of aggregation for these nanohybrids (e.g.,
UCEr@PSS in Figure S14).

Chemical
and Photophysical Stability of the Sulfonate-Coated
UCEr NPs in Water
The disintegration of the inorganic
core of UCEr in highly diluted aqueous dispersions (10
μg/mL, 8mL) was evaluated for those systems that showed stable
organic capping upon acid treatment, that is, UCEr@PSS
and UCEr@PAMPS. For this purpose, the dissolution of UCEr@PSS and UCEr@PAMPS into their constituents, Y3+, Yb3+, and Er3+/Tm3+, was
measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),
which is an appropriate quantification method for the release of the
ions from the inorganic nanoparticles,4 and the process was monitored for up to 96 h. For comparative purposes,
the disintegration of the bare UCEr NPs was also analyzed.
Briefly, 8 mL of each colloid (10 μg/mL) was vortexed (200 rpm/min)
at room temperature for 24h. Then, a 2mL aliquot was taken, and after
centrifugation (15000 rpm/min, 20 min) and filtration, the supernatant
was analyzed by ICP-MS. This process was repeated at 24 h intervals
up to 96 h with aliquots taken from the remaining solution to determine
the chemical stability of the nanoparticles (see results in Table 1 and a schematic representation
of the process in Figure S15 in the Supporting Information).

Ln3+ from the starting UCEr nanoparticle.

Data in Table 1 show
that the two sulfonated polymers clearly prevented the disintegration
of the NP when compared to that of the bare NP (there was a 100-fold
less dissolved Ln3+ total concentration for the PSS-capped
nanoparticle compared to the bare UCEr after 24 h), but
PSS was more effective than PAMPS. This could be attributed to the
high hydrophobicity of the polystyrene moiety in PSS and/or the higher
content of sulfonate groups in this polymer that have a stronger binding
capacity than the amide in PAMPS.

An interesting observation
was the decrease in the Ln3+ concentration in the supernatant
arising from the disintegration
of the bare UCEr NPs under prolonged incubation in water,
specifically 72 and 96 h (Table 1). This may be due to the deposition of the ions as
complexes on the NP surface. In fact, ICP-MS results of the solid
residue in the centrifuged samples at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h showed
how the ratio between lanthanides in the bare UCEr nanoparticles
was changing over time (Figure S16). Interestingly,
the ratio of Y increased, but the ratio of both Yb and Er decreased.
This explains why the total ion concentration in the supernatant decreased
with extended suspension times. This process was much less evident
in UCEr@PAMPS, once again corroborating the high chemical
stability provided by PAMPS to the inorganic nanoparticle. In addition,
the structural integrity of the bare UCEr and UCEr@PPS nanoparticles
was monitored by TEM for up to 96 h. These experiments show the drastic
corrosion of the bare nanoparticles. These images also demonstrate
the beneficial effect of the polysulfonate in preventing the nanoparticle
disintegration (Figure S17).

Finally,
the photophysical stability, that is, the upconversion
luminescence in aqueous media of UCEr@PSS, UCTm@PSS, and naked UCEr (particle concentration of 5 μg/mL),
was evaluated. The luminescence spectra (λex = 975
nm) were registered after incubating the nanoparticles for 24 h (every
90 min for the first 8 h and then at 24 h) in pure water while being
slowly shaken. The area under the curve was calculated for each measurement. Figure 5 clearly shows a
loss of emission intensity for bare UCEr. As explained
above, this fact could be attributed not only to the loss of doping
ions (Yb/Er) and disintegration of UCEr but also to adsorption
of some of the “dissolved” ions on the nanoparticle
surface. Undoubtedly, the best photostability was observed for UCLn@PSS, which wholly agrees with the lower dissolution of lanthanide
ions in water as observed by ICP-MS. Therefore, coating the UCEr with PSS not only allowed chemical stability in highly acidic
medium but also prevented dissolution of its inorganic UCEr core into its lanthanide ions and preserved the upconversion emission
for longer periods.

Conclusions
In
summary, we demonstrate here that not only do highly acidic
polysulfonates remain strongly coordinated to the NaYF4:Ln3+ UCNPs in strong acidic media and provide the nanoparticle
with high dispersibility in water as well as additional functionality
but also these cappings meet the requirements for an adequate protection
of NaYF4:Ln3+ UCNPs to preserve their integrity
in highly diluted water dispersions. These are especially interesting
results because an adequate capping can preserve the luminescence
properties of the UCNPS as well as avoid the (bio)toxicity caused
by the disintegration of the nanoparticles into toxic ions, such as
fluoride ions. The next step is to study the capacity of the sulfonate
capping to preserve the chemical stability and photophysical features
of the nanoparticles in highly diluted, strongly acidic solutions;
these studies are ongoing and will be reported in due course.

Materials
and Methods
The chemicals used for the nanoparticle syntheses
were lanthanide
chlorides (YCl3·6H2O, YbCl3·6H2O, ErCl3·6H2O, TmCl3·6H2O, and NdCl3·6H2O
(>99.9%, all of them)), 1-octadecene (95%), oleic acid (70%), and
NaOH and NH4F (99.99%). All of these chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without previous purification.
The chemicals used for the coatings were poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate,
(Mw of ∼25,000) (see the Supporting Information), poly(sodium 4-styrene
sulfonate), PSS (Mw of ∼70,000, Sigma-Aldrich),
mPEG5K-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-decanol
(>97%, Alfa Aesar). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
were obtained using a Jeol 1010 microscope operating at 100 kV equipped
with a digital camera (AMT RX80; 8 megapixels). For the preparation
of the samples, 10 μL of a 0.5 mg·mL–1 solution of the UCNPs was left to dry under vacuum at room temperature
on a Formvar/carbon film supported on a 300-mesh copper grid. High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were recorded using
a TECNAI G2 F20 microscope operating at 200 kV (point resolution of
0.24 nm) and equipped with a CCD GATAN camera. XRD analyses were performed
on a Bruker D8 Advance A25 diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ
= 1.54060 Å) radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and 30 mA, and a
LynxEye detector. The powder diffraction pattern was scanned over
the angular range of 2–80° (2θ) with a step size
of 0.020° at room temperature. All FTIR spectra were obtained
using an FTIR Thermo Nicolet Nexus spectrophotometer at room temperature
with 64 scans and a resolution of 4 cm–1 between
400 and 4000 cm–1. The TGA analyses were carried
out using a TGA 550 from TA instruments with an operative temperature
range 50-800 °C and 0.1 microgram sensitivity. The samples were
heated from 50 to 750°C, with an increase of 5°C·min–1 and under air flux of 50 mL·min–1. The pH measurements were carried out by using a pH meter (GLP21).
Centrifugation was carried out in a Thermo-Scientific Legend XIR.
ICP-MS analyses were carried out using an ICP-MS Agilent 7900. Dynamic
light scattering and zeta potential (ζ) analyses
were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS from Malvern.

Synthesis of UCLn Coated with Polystyrene Sulfonate
(UCLn@PSS)
A mixture of 2 mL of UCLn@BF4 dispersed in DMF (50mg/mL), DMF (3 mL) and PSS (1.7
mL) was kept under vigorous stirring at 60 °C. This turbid mixture
was further stirred for 24 h. Then, the BF4– capping was replaced by PSS. The dispersion was centrifuged for
20 min at 15000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. Then, the
coated UCLn@PSS NPs were redispersed in 10 mL of milliQ-water
and centrifuged for 15 min at 15000 rpm to remove excess PSS. This
step was repeated three times. Finally, the pellet was redispersed
in DMF (5 mL) and centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 rpm to get rid of
larger agglomerates.

Synthesis of UCLn Coated with
Poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate)
(UCLn@PAMPS)
To 2 mL of a UCLn@BF4 dispersion (50mg/mL DMF), 500 mg of AMPS dissolved in 3 mL
of DMF was added and kept under vigorous stirring at 60 °C for
24 h to displace BF4– and obtain UCLn@PAMPS. The following steps were identical to those described
above for purification of UCLn@PSS.

Synthesis of UCLn Coated with mPEG5K-Phosphate (UCLn@PEGP)
Naked
UCLn NPs were coated with
mPEG5K-phosphate by following the procedure previously described .29,30 In short, approximately 50 mg of naked UCLn dispersed
in 2 mL of absolute ethanol was placed into a glass vial, and 300
mg of PEG-phosphate ligand was added to it. The vial was capped tightly,
and the resulting solution was stirred overnight at 60 °C. Then,
it was cooled to room temperature, UCLn@PEGP NPs were collected
via centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was
discarded. The pellet was redispersed in 10 mL of milliQ-water and
centrifuged for 15 min at 10000 rpm. This washing step was repeated
in triplicate.

Synthesis of UCLn Coated with
1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluoro-1-decanol
(UCLn@PFD)
To 2 mL of a UCLn@BF4 dispersion in DMF (50mg/mL), 500 mg of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-decanol
dissolved in 3 mL of DMF and four drops of triethylamine were added
under vigorous stirring at 50 °C for 24 h. The dispersion was
centrifuged for 20 min at 15000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded.
The pellet was redispersed in 10 mL of methanol and centrifuged for
15 min at 15000 rpm twice. Additionally, it was washed two times by
dispersion in 10 mL of methanol. Finally, the pellet was redispersed
in 5 mL of DMF.

Steady-State Photoluminescence
Steady-state
photoluminescence
spectra were obtained at room temperature with a 2 nm slit width and
5 nm·s–1 speed scan using an SLM Amingo Bowmann
series 2 (AB2) fluorometer (Microbeam, S.A.). The AB2 software (v.5.5)
was used to register the data. Upconversion emission spectra were
recorded by excitation at 975 ± 10 nm using a CW 975 nm diode
laser (Thorlabs L975P1WJ) as an excitation source coupled to the fluorometer.

Measurement of the Nanohybrid Emission versus pH
The
selected coated UCLn was dispersed in milliQ-water (5 mg
× 5 mL–1), and the pH of the colloidal dispersion
was measured at room temperature. Subsequently, different aliquots
(5 or 10 μL) of HCl solution (0.1 or 0.5M) were added, and after
each addition, the pH and the emission were measured up to pH 2 or
slightly lower. Next, the emission was registered again after 12 h
under continuous stirring. After that, the sample was centrifuged
at 15000 rpm for 20 min, and the solid was washed twice with 5 mL
of milliQ-water. After removing the supernatant, the solid was dried
under vacuum, and the FTIR spectrum was registered.

Chemical Stability
of UCEr@PSS, UCEr@PAMPS
and Bare UCEr@PSS in Water
A dissolution test
of the UCLn NPs into its constituents Y3+, Yb3+, and Er3+/Tm3+ was performed for UCEr@PSS, UCEr@PAMPS, and bare UCEr@PSS.
In each case, the colloid (8 mL, 10 μg/mL) in water was shaken
(200 rpm/min) at room temperature for 24 h. Then, a 2mL aliquot was
taken and centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 20 min to remove the majority
of the UCLn, and the supernatant was subsequently filtered31 by using an ACRODISC GHP 0.2 μm filter
to avoid the presence of UCLn. This process was repeated
three times to determine the chemical stability of the nanoparticles
for up to 96 h (see results in Table 1). Finally, the supernatants were taken for analysis
by ICP-MS using a spectrometer (IC-MS Agilent 7900) (see schematic
representation of the process in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information).

Photophysical Stability
of UCLn@PSS in Water
The effect of the Ln3+ ion dissolution from the UCNP on
their upconversion emission was studied by following a procedure similar
to that previously described.4 Briefly,
UCLn@PSS (5 μg/mL) and naked-UCEr (5 μg/mL)
solutions in water were prepared and stirred at room temperature.
The emission intensity of these solutions was monitored by recording
the emission spectrum between 0 and 24 h. Then, the area under the
emission peaks was measured.

i The coordination chemistry of fluorocarbon
C–F moieties with metal cations has been previously reviewed
in 1997 and 2004 (see refs (16) and (17)). In addition, the activation of C–F bonds by bonding lanthanide
ions has been reported (see refs (18) and (19)).

ii NMR measurements
combined with DFT
theoretical calculations have revealed the existence of intramolecular
hydrogen bonds in organofluorine-substituted derivatives of different
classes of molecules (ref (27)). In addition, it has been suggested that proton–fluoride
interactions can play a significant role in the stabilization of conformational
molecular states ,especially via cooperativity(ref (28))
