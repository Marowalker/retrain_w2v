Heterogeneous Zr-Mont
catalyst prepared by a simple protocol was
employed for the production of diesel fuel precursors via Friedel–Crafts
(FC) alkylation of petroleum-derived arenes (e.g., mesitylene, xylene,
and toluene) with biomass-derived 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF),
HMF derivatives, and carbohydrates. Initially, several acidic catalysts
were screened for the FC alkylation of mesitylene with HMF in nitroethane
solvent. Among all, Zr-Mont catalyst gave an exceptionally high yield
(80%) of mesitylmethylfurfural (MMF). The catalytic activity of Zr-Mont
was also evaluated for the alkylation of different petroleum-derived
arenes with ester/halogen derivatives of HMF. Suitable acid strength
and high surface area of Zr-Mont were its major attributes to make
it the most efficient solid acid catalyst for this FC reaction. Even
after several reuses, the catalytic activity of Zr-Mont was found
to be consistent, which was also evidenced by the acidity measurements
of fresh and reused Zr-Mont catalysts by temperature-programmed desorption
of ammonia and pyridine Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques.
Direct conversion of glucose to diesel fuel precursors was also attempted
over Zr-Mont catalyst in mesitylene and polar nonacidic solvents at
150 °C. However, the activity of Zr-Mont catalyst was limited
for glucose dehydration to HMF and MMF did not form. When the same
experiment was performed in formic acid medium, MMF was produced in
34% yield. After the addition of formic acid, the reaction becomes
biphasic which contains mesitylene as an organic phase and formic
acid as an aqueous phase. Formic acid worked as a solvent, reactant,
and cocatalyst, whereas mesitylene worked as a reactant and product
extraction phase to enable easy product isolation. With this strategy,
other diesel fuel precursors were also produced in 26–30% yields
from glucose and different arenes. Similar strategy was successfully
extended for the conversion of sucrose to diesel fuel precursors.

Introduction
For chemicals and liquid
fuels, the society is heavily relying
on crude oil which has certainly a limited stock on the earth. This
imminent crisis can be overcome by an alternative feedstock such as
cellulosic biomass; the latter has become one of the most exploited
research areas.1 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural
(HMF) derived from cellulose is recognized as a principle raw material
for the production of liquid fuels2−6 and a monomer for the polymers.7,8 To produce
diesel-range C11–C23 alkanes from HMF,
it needs to undergo carbon upgradation process via C–C bond
formation.9 Some of the efforts made in
this direction involving C–C bond-forming reactions include
(i) base-catalyzed aldol condensation of HMF with acetone,10 (ii) amine-catalyzed Baylis–Hillman reactions
between methylacrylate and HMF,11 (iii)
coupling of HMF and isoprene over a ruthenium complex,12 and (iv) condensation of HMF with 2-methylfuran.13 These upgraded products are carbon-rich; hence,
they can be converted into diesel-range liquid hydrocarbons via ring-opening–dehydration–hydrodeoxygenation
processes.10,14

In 2015, Corma et al. produced
alkyl naphthenic kerosene from HMF
and substituted benzenes via Friedel–Crafts (FC) alkylation
using zeolites followed by hydrodeoxygenation process over a platinum-based
catalyst.14 However, currently there is
only one industrial process for the bulk production of HMF from biomass-derived
feedstocks.15 Because HMF has high solubility
in aqueous reaction mixtures, its extraction is a tedious task. In
addition to that HMF has low stability in acidic mediums and also
produces a large amount of tarry degradation products during its recovery
by distillation at high temperature. Therefore, researchers have focused
their attention on technologies where the carbohydrates can be directly
converted into advanced chemicals/fuel precursors without isolating
the unstable intermediate (HMF). In this direction, Zhou and Rauchfuss
reported an excellent work on the production of hybrid diesel fuel
precursors from carbohydrates and petrochemicals using formic acid
as a reactive solvent to dissolve carbohydrates as well as a reagent
for making a reactive intermediate named as 5-(formyloxymethyl)furfural
(FMF).16 However, in this reaction sequence,
catalytic amount of concd HCl was required for the isomerization of
glucose and other glucose-based carbohydrates into fructose, which
limits its commercial exploitation because of its hazardous nature
as well as waste formation. Recently, Nale and Jadhav reported alkylation
of aromatic arenes with fructose over Glu–Fe3O4–SO3H catalyst without isolation of the
HMF intermediate.17 This approach is limited
to fructose only and not useful for the complex carbohydrates such
as glucose and sucrose. Glucose is relatively more stable than fructose,
which makes its dehydration much more difficult. Conversion of glucose
into HMF proceeds in two steps: the first step is glucose isomerization
to fructose in the presence of an enzyme or a Lewis acid or a base
catalyst18 and the second step is the dehydration
of fructose to HMF. Wang et al. reported a montmorillonite-based (Sn-Mont)
catalyst for the isomerization of glucose to fructose followed by
its dehydration to HMF.19 Very recently,
we have converted carbohydrates to condensation products (diesel fuel
precursors) via an integrated process using Sn-Mont and formic acid
without isolating furfural intermediates.20 This approach avoided the tedious isolation and purification of
furfural intermediates.

In this work, Zr-Mont catalyst easily
prepared via the ion exchange
of natural montmorillonite with an aqueous ZrOCl2·8H2O solution was employed for the carbon upgradation processes.
The catalytic activity of Zr-Mont was initially evaluated for FC alkylation
of arenes (e.g., mesitylene, xylene, and toluene) with HMF and HMF
derivatives. We have continued our efforts for the conversion of carbohydrates
to diesel fuel precursors. The schematic of our approach for directly
producing diesel fuel precursors from glucose is elaborated in Scheme 1. This approach is
a three-step reaction sequence which involves (i) glucose isomerization
to fructose, (ii) dehydration–esterification of fructose to
HMF derivatives, and (iii) FC alkylation of arenes with HMF derivatives.
The Zr-Mont catalyst that acts as a Lewis acid because of the presence
of Zr4+ ions was also found to be efficient for the isomerization
of complex carbohydrates (e.g., glucose and sucrose) to fructose.
In situ-formed fructose could be dehydrated to HMF/HMF-ester and could
subsequently undergo FC alkylation with an arene molecule in formic
acid medium. Formic acid served as a reactive solvent as well as a
cocatalyst. Notably, the use of formic acid in this process is appealing
as it is obtained from biomass degradation,21 regenerable,22 safe, and cheap.23 The phenomenal stability and recyclability of
Zr-Mont makes it a very viable alternative to the liquid acid (e.g.,
HCl) usually used in this process.

Temperature-Programmed
Desorption of Ammonia Analysis
The temperature-programmed
desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD)
analysis reveals that the total acid strength of Sn-Mont was much
higher than that of montmorillonite, Fe-Mont, Al-Mont, and Zr-Mont.
The trend of acid strength of all of these catalysts was as follows:
montmorillonite (90.08 μmol g–1) < Fe-Mont
(190.63 μmol g–1) < Al-Mont (309.17 μmol
g–1) < Zr-Mont-R3B (344.44 μmol g–1) < Zr-Mont-R3A (359.10 μmol g–1) <
Zr-Mont (380.30 μmol g–1) < Sn-Mont (511.90
μmol g–1). Although, Sn-Mont showed the highest
acidity, Zr-Mont with the second highest acidity was found to be the
most suitable catalyst for our targeted application; therefore, its
stability in terms of acidity retention was evaluated by NH3-TPD analysis of the used catalyst samples (Figure 1). Almost identical NH3-TPD profiles
were observed for Zr-Mont-fresh, Zr-Mont-R3A (after reusing three
times for HMF to mesitylmethylfurfural (MMF) reaction; Figure 6), and Zr-Mont-R3B (after reusing
three times for glucose to MMF reaction, Figure 9). A very marginal decrease in the total
acidities of reused samples was noticed (Table 1).

and Zr-Mont-R3B.

Pyridine Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis
The types of acid sites present
in our catalyst samples were identified
by using pyridine Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
The pyridine FTIR spectra of montmorillonite and metal-exchanged montmorillonite
samples (Fe-Mont, Al-Mont, and Sn-Mont) are depicted in Figure S1
(Supporting Information). To identify/evaluate
the acidity of these catalysts, difference in the spectrum before
pyridine adsorption from that obtained after pyridine adsorption of
the respective catalyst was taken. The band at 1441 cm–1 signifies Lewis acidity; the band at 1490 cm–1 represents a combination of Lewis and Brønsted acidities, and
the bands at 1548 and 1638 cm–1 signify Brønsted
acidity.24 The acidity trend of montmorillonite
catalysts by Py-FTIR was found to be as follows: montmorillonite (119.40
μmol g–1) < Fe-Mont (222.20 μmol
g–1) < Al-Mont (331.45 μmol g–1) < Zr-Mont-R3B (379.33 μmol g–1) <
Zr-Mont-R3A (388.88 μmol g–1) < Zr-Mont
(404.14 μmol g–1) < Sn-Mont (532.37 μmol
g–1). All metal-exchanged montmorillonite catalysts
possessed significantly large amount of medium acid sites compared
to their weak and strong acid sites. To investigate the different
types of acidic sites and acid strengths of Zr-Mont-R3A and Zr-Mont-R3B
samples, their Py-FTIR spectra (Figure 2) were recorded at different temperatures using the
method proposed by Emeis.25 Brønsted
acidities of Zr-Mont-R3A and Zr-Mont-R3B samples were found to be
284.22 and 276.8 μmol g–1, respectively, whereas
the Lewis acidities of these samples were found to be 104.66 and 102.53
μmol g–1, respectively. Even after third reuse,
the Brønsted/Lewis acid (B/L) ratios of Zr-Mont-R3A (B/L = 2.71)
and Zr-Mont-R3B (B/L = 2.69) were almost similar to that of fresh
Zr-Mont sample (B/L = 2.73) (Table 1).

Figure 2 Pyridine FTIR spectra of Zr-Mont-R3A and Zr-Mont-R3B at
different
evacuation temperatures.

From NH3-TPD and Py-FTIR analysis, it could be
confirmed
that Zr-Mont did not lose its acidity in significant amount even after
being reused for three times. The surface area of the spent catalysts
was decreased slightly from 196 to 171 m2 g–1 for Zr-Mont-R3A and 158 m2 g–1 for
Zr-Mont-R3B. The decrease in the specific surface area of Zr-Mont
catalysts after their reuse was probably due to the carbon deposits
on the surface. The inductively coupled plasma–optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP–OES) analysis confirmed that no leaching
of Zr metal from Zr-Mont catalyst took place under our reaction conditions.

Alkylation of Mesitylene with HMF over Various Catalysts
The FC alkylation of mesitylene with HMF was carried out in nitroethane
over different acid catalysts, and the results are summarized in Table 2. FC alkylation of
mesitylene with HMF was carried out in the presence of catalytic amount
of concd H2SO4 at 80 °C for 3 h, which
showed that HMF was consumed completely to give 75% yield of the coupling
product (MMF, 1) along with 11% of 5,5′-oxy(bismethylene)-2-furaldehyde
(OBMF) (Table 2, entry
1). Nevertheless, concd H2SO4 is hazardous in
nature, nonrecyclable, and produces byproduct, which limits its further
exploitation. When commercially available sulfonic acid-functionalized
polystyrene (Amberlyst-15) solid acid catalyst was explored, MMF was
formed in 79% yield with 7% of OBMF (Table 2, entry 2). In the presence of the Lewis
acid (ZrOCl2·8H2O), MMF was produced in
30% yield after a quite longer reaction time of 16 h (Table 2, entry 3). The lower yield
of MMF in the presence of ZrOCl2·8H2O was
attributed to the formation of a chlorination product [5-(chloromethyl)furfural
(CMF)] of HMF. To convert in-situ formed CMF into MMF, the reaction
was prolonged for 16 h. Even after such a long period, the yield of
MMF did not improve. The performance of naturally occurring montmorillonite
clay possessing Lewis acidity was also evaluated for this reaction,
but even at the elevated temperature of 110 °C, only 21% yield
of product 1 was noticed (Table 2, entry 4). It is well-known that the acidity
of montmorillonite could be significantly enhanced by a metal-exchange
process.26,27 In this context, Zr-exchanged montmorillonite
clay (Zr-Mont) was used for the FC alkylation of mesitylene with HMF.
Over Zr-Mont catalyst (0.1 g) and at 110 °C, HMF was treated
with mesitylene to give MMF in 86% yield with only 2% of OBMF (Table 2, entry 5). Decreasing
the catalyst (Zr-Mont) amount from 0.1 to 0.05 g, affected the conversion
of HMF obviously due to the shortfall of the active sites (Table 2, entry 6). On the
contrary, by increasing catalyst loading to 0.2 g, the yield of OBMF
was increased to 17% (Table 2, entry 7). Sn4+-incorporated montmorillonite catalyst
(Sn-Mont, 0.1 g) showed 70% yield of MMF with 21% of OBMF (Table 2, entry 8). This observation
well-matched with our previous reports.26b Surprisingly, even though the acidity of Sn-Mont (511.90 μmol
g–1, Table 1) was higher than that of the Zr-Mont (380.3 μmol g–1, Table 1), the yield of MMF was found to be lower because of the formation
of OBMF (4); the formation of OBMF was promoted because
of the higher acidity of Sn-Mont along with lower B/L ratio (2.09)
and lower surface area of (183 m2 g–1, Table 1) than Zr-Mont
(196 m2 g–1, Table 1). Al3+- and Fe3+-exchanged
montmorillonite catalysts showed 57 and 43% yield of MMF with 72 and
55% conversion of HMF, respectively (Table 2, entries 9 and 10). Thus, the suitable acid
strength and high surface area of Zr-Mont contributed to its excellent
activity in terms of the yield of MMF. Although, MMF was produced
in high yield from HMF over a recyclable Zr-Mont catalyst, the present
cost of pure HMF is a major deterrent factor for the development of
downstream processes. Therefore, crude HMF obtained from fructose
was reacted with mesitylene to obtain 83% yield of MMF (Table 2, entry 11). The use of crude
HMF for the synthesis of desired products avoided the energy-intensive
separation/purification of HMF, offering a cost-efficient process
for the practical production of product 1 from fructose.

Effect of Reaction Temperature
on FC Alkylation of Mesitylene
with HMF
FC alkylation of mesitylene with HMF was carried
out over Zr-Mont catalyst for a period of 16 h under different temperatures
ranging from 80 to 120 °C (Figure 3). MMF was produced in 29 and 64% yields at 80 and
100 °C, respectively. Interestingly, when the same reaction was
conducted at 110 °C, MMF was obtained in significantly high yield
of 86% with complete consumption of HMF. Thus, temperature lower than
110 °C was not effective to push the reaction to completion,
whereas at the elevated temperature of 120 °C, 77% yield of MMF
was obtained with 10% of self-etherification product (OBMF). Thus,
110 °C is the optimum reaction temperature used for further experiments.

nitroethane (5 mL), and Zr-Mont (0.1 g), 80–120 °C, 16
h. Conversion of HMF was measured using HPLC and reported yields were
isolated.

Effect of Reaction Time
on FC Alkylation of Mesitylene with
HMF
Effect of reaction time on FC alkylation of mesitylene
with HMF was studied by monitoring the reaction after specific time
intervals (Figure 4). In the first 2 h, HMF was consumed upto 36% with 30% yield of
MMF. After 9th hour, the formation of OBMF began and reached
to the maximum of 2% and remained steady at the end of 16th hour. HMF conversion and yield of MMF gradually increased to 99
and 86%, respectively, during the time span of 16 h.

(5 mL), and Zr-Mont (0.1 g), 110 °C, 2–16 h. Conversion

Influence of Solvents on the Production of MMF from Mesitylene
and HMF
Influence of different solvents was studied on the
FC alkylation of mesitylene with HMF, and the results are presented
in Figure 5. Under
the optimized experimental conditions and in the absence of solvent,
MMF yield obtained was 29% along with 49% of OBMF. In the aqueous
medium, the reaction did not proceed because of the equilibrium between
HMF and dehydrated HMF. Solvents such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile,
and tetrahydrofuran were not suitable for this reaction. Etherification
of HMF in the presence of alcohol such as methanol gave 5-(methoxymethyl)furfural
in 95% yield. In dichloroethane, only 12% of MMF was formed along
with 51% of OBMF. After evaluating several solvents, we found that
nitroethane is the best solvent to achieve the highest yield (86%)
of MMF.

Zr-Mont Recycling Studies
The stability and reusability
of Zr-Mont catalyst were investigated for the FC alkylation of mesitylene
with HMF. In a typical recycle experiment, Zr-Mont catalyst after
the first run was filtered, washed with acetone (5 mL × 2), and
dried in an oven for 1 h at 110 °C before using it for the next
cycle. As can be seen from Figure 6, after each reuse of Zr-Mont,
HMF conversion was almost >95% with slight decrease in the yield
of
MMF. The retention of acidity of Zr-Mont was also confirmed by NH3-TPD and Py-FTIR analysis of fresh and reused Zr-Mont sample
(Figures 1 and 2).

each cycle, the catalyst was washed with acetone and dried in the
oven at 100 °C for 1 h prior to use for the next cycle. Conversion
of HMF was measured using HPLC and reported yields were isolated.

Synthesis of Arylmethylfurfural
from Different HMF Derivatives
The arylation protocol using
Zr-Mont catalyst was also extended
to the ester and halogen derivatives of HMF, and the results are summarized
in Table 3. Initially,
HMF was treated with xylene to afford arylation products 2 in 59% yield. Our protocol gave higher yield of product 2 than that reported by Beller et al. using FeCl3 under
a solvent-free condition providing 37% yield of the coupled product.28 When toluene was treated with HMF, coupling
product 3 was produced in 69% yield (Table 3, entry 1). Ester derivatives
of HMF offer some important advantages over HMF for industrial production.
Compared with the hydroxymethyl functionality of HMF, the ester functionality
makes them hydrophobic, stable, and more readily isolable from the
aqueous reaction mixture, whereas HMF is known to be relatively unstable
under acidic conditions (easily undergo polymerization) and is difficult
to isolate from the aqueous reaction mixture.29 Therefore, we prepared few ester derivatives of HMF and tested them
for the reaction with arenes. The formate derivative FMF of HMF seemed
to be relatively more active than HMF as it provided high yields 85,
71, and 84% of arylmethylfurfurals 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Table 3, entry 2). Similarly, 5-(acetoxymethyl)furfural
(AcMF) also actively reacted with mesitylene, xylene, and toluene
to give high yields of arylmethylfurfurals 1, 2, and 3 (Table 3, entry 2), respectively. Electron-withdrawing ester functionality
on FMF/AcMF makes them more active electrophiles to react with nucleophilic
arenes. Next, we studied the reactivity of the halogen derivative
of HMF such as 5-(chloro/bromomethyl)furfural. CMF was treated with
mesitylene to obtain the product 1 in 90% yield, whereas
after reaction with xylene, only 80% yield of 2 was obtained.
On the other hand, toluene reacted relatively faster with CMF to give
92% yield of 3 (Table 3, entry 4). Under identical reaction conditions, 5-(bromomethyl)furfural
(BMF) was treated with different arenes and yields of coupling products 1, 2, and 3 were comparable with
the products formed from CMF (Table 3, entry 5). The starting materials such as CMF and
BMF used in the above experiments were prepared from HMF (see Supporting Information).

Direct, One-Pot Synthesis
of MMF from Glucose and Mesitylene
Although, the crude HMF
could be utilized for the FC alkylation
with mesitylene, two separate operations must be carried out. Hence,
without isolating HMF, direct conversion of its precursors (e.g.,
glucose, fructose, and sucrose) to diesel fuel precursors is possible
as this cascade process is acid-catalyzed. Therefore, initially we
selected glucose as a potential HMF precursor, which is more abundant
and relatively much cheaper than HMF. The production of MMF from glucose
requires three steps: (i) isomerization of glucose to fructose, (ii)
dehydration of fructose to HMF, and (iii) coupling of HMF with mesitylene.
As shown in the Scheme 2, this process requires two types of catalysts such as a Lewis acid
(for glucose isomerization) and Brønsted acid (dehydration of
fructose and FC alkylation reaction).

Scheme 2 Process for the Production
of MMF (1) from Glucose
For this purpose, we employed Zr-Mont catalyst which has
a unique
combination of Lewis + Brønsted acid sites for the purpose of
glucose conversion to MMF. At first, glucose dehydration–FC
alkylation sequence was carried out in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at
150 °C over Zr-Mont catalyst. However, even after 24 h of reaction,
only HMF was formed in 34% yield without the formation of MMF (Table 4, entry 1). As we
found out nitroethane was effective for FC alkylation of arenes with
HMF, next experiment with nitroethane + DMSO was carried out to promote
the FC alkylation reaction. However, in this experiment also, only
HMF was observed without MMF (Table 4, entry 2). After unsuccessful attempt in DMSO, we
tested an ionic liquid, C4mimBr (1-butyl-3-methyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium bromide) as a reaction medium, which was
also found to be ineffective for the promotion of FC alkylation of
in situ-formed HMF and mesitylene (Table 4, entry 3). In the above cases, MMF was not
formed, which could be attributed to the limited or no activity of
Zr-Mont after glucose dehydration to HMF. This loss in activity of
Zr-Mont could be due to the blocking of active centers by the deposition
of polymeric products generated in the glucose dehydration step.

After the above attempts, we
used acidic solvents which could dissolve
glucose as well as help to promote the FC alkylation step. Thus, the
first experiment was conducted in acetic acid at 150 °C for a
period of 16 h to give 6% of MMF (Table 5, entry 1). Therefore, the medium with higher
acidity such as formic acid was evaluated, and surprisingly, complete
consumption of glucose was observed with 34% yield of MMF (Table 5, entry 2). Thus,
the formation of MMF (1) from glucose was successfully
achieved because of the cooperative catalysis between Zr-Mont and
formic acid. Lewis acid sites present on Zr-Mont played a crucial
role for glucose isomerization to fructose and further reactions could
be promoted by formic acid.

For the comparison purpose,
several other montmorillonite-based
solid acids were screened in place of Zr-Mont for this reaction. In
the presence of Sn-Mont catalyst also MMF was produced with the same
yield (34%) of that obtained over Zr-Mont (Table 5, entry 3). Al-Mont and Fe-Mont gave 32 and
31% yield of MMF, respectively (Table 5, entries 4 and 5). From these results (Table 5, entry 6), it is clear that
glucose isomerization to fructose is a key step which is not possible
without using a Lewis acid catalyst (Scheme 3). However, 27% conversion of glucose seen
may be due the esterification of hydroxyl groups of glucose. A very
important process benefit presented in Figure 7 is that mesitylene acting as a reactant
as well as a product extraction phase, formic acid acting as a reactive
solvent, and Zr-Mont acting as a solid Lewis acid which settled down
and to be separated by simple filtration.

phase from glucose.

Effect of Reaction Time on the Production of MMF from Glucose
Progress of dehydration–FC alkylation of glucose with mesitylene
was monitored by withdrawing samples after specific time intervals
and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Figure 8). Under experimental
conditions, in just 1 h, 81% of glucose was consumed with 43, 20,
and 4% yields of fructose, HMF, and FMF, respectively. After 2 h of
reaction, glucose was consumed completely with 28, 17, and 7% yields
of fructose, HMF, and FMF, respectively. Dehydration of glucose appeared
to be a rapid process. At the end of 4th hour, fructose was completely
consumed with the maximum yield of 35% of HMF along with 14% of FMF
and 2% of MMF. Then, HMF was slowly converted into FMF and was subsequently
converted into MMF later. The yield of MMF was gradually increased
to 34% after 16 h of reaction.

to MMF with time. Reaction
conditions: glucose (0.5 g), mesitylene (10 mL), formic acid (5 mL),
and Zr-Mont (0.2 g), 150 °C, 16 h.

Recycling of Zr-Mont Catalysts for the Production of MMF from
Glucose
The stability and reusability of Zr-Mont was investigated
for the production of MMF from glucose in formic acid medium. Because
of the heterogeneous nature of the Zr-Mont catalyst, it could be easily
recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration, and its reusability
was studied for MMF production from glucose at 150 °C. It was
revealed that the catalyst could be readily recycled six times without
any reduction in catalyst activity (Figure 9). After each reuse
of Zr-Mont, glucose conversion was almost >95% with a slight drop
in the yield of MMF.

Reaction
conditions: glucose (0.5 g), mesitylene (10 mL), formic acid (5 mL),
and Zr-Mont (0.2 g), 150 °C, 16 h. After each cycle, the catalyst
was washed with acetone and dried in the oven at 100 °C for 1
h prior to use for the next cycle.

Direct, One-Pot Synthesis of Arylmethylfurfural from Glucose
and Arenes
Instead of mesitylene, we further conducted the
reaction of xylene and toluene with glucose in formic acid medium.
With toluene, product 2 was formed in 30% yield directly
from glucose, whereas with xylene, product 3 was formed
in 26% yield (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Production of Arylmethylfurfural from Glucose and Toluene/Xylene
One-Pot Synthesis of Coupling
Products from Sucrose and Arenes
After successful conversion
of glucose, the conversion of more
complex carbohydrates such as sucrose (8) was also explored.
Sucrose is a disaccharide containing one glucose and one fructose
unit and its acid hydrolysis breaks down the glycosidic bond between
glucose and fructose unit in an acidic medium. The glucose unit of
sucrose was intended to isomerize to fructose over Zr-Mont catalyst.
Under similar experimental conditions, sucrose was dehydrated to FMF
and the generated FMF was coupled with mesitylene to afford the product 1 in 40% yield. In the next experiment, we used xylene for
the FC alkylation with in situ-formed HMF/FMF to obtain product 2 in 28% yield. Similarly, product 3 was formed
in 38% yield from FC alkylation of toluene with in situ-generated
HMF/FMF (Scheme 5).

Conclusions
An efficient approach
for the production of diesel fuel precursors
is demonstrated using a combination of biomass and petroleum-derived
feedstocks. FC alkylation of arenes (e.g., mesitylene, xylene, and
toluene) with HMF or its derivatives was successfully achieved over
Zr-Mont catalyst. Various solvents were screened for this reaction,
among which nitroethane showed an excellent suitability. Appropriate
acid strength and high surface area of Zr-Mont catalyst resulted in
the highest yield of arylmethylfurfural. The stability of Zr-Mont
was successfully confirmed by its recycle runs. Further, in a one-pot
strategy to synthesize MMF from glucose, Zr-Mont promoted the sluggish
isomerization of glucose to fructose and formic acid effectively converted
in situ-formed fructose into MMF (1) in 34% yield. Using
this protocol, arylmethylfurfural was successfully produced by treating
glucose with xylene and toluene. Sucrose was also efficiently converted
to arylmethylfurfural such as 1, 2, and 3 with 40, 28, and 38% yields, respectively. The phenomenal
stability and recyclability of solid acid (Zr-Mont) would replace
the hazardous mineral acids (e.g., concd HCl) to make the process
green. Importantly, the use of formic acid was found to be attractive
as it acted as a solvent to dissolve carbohydrates as well as the
cocatalyst to promote FC alkylation.

Experimental Section
Materials
HMF, C4mimBr, inorganic metal
precursors such as ZrOCl2·8H2O, SnCl4·5H2O, FeCl3·6H2O, AlCl3·6H2O, and montmorillonite clay
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Acetic acid (100%), formic
acid (98–100%), and carbohydrates such as fructose, sucrose,
and glucose were procured from Thomas Baker, India. All solvents and
inorganic solids such as NaHCO3 and Na2SO4 were purchased from ChemLabs, India. The starting materials
such as 5-(formyl/acetyloxymethyl)furfural and 5-(chloro/bromomethyl)furfural
were prepared according to the procedure reported in the literature
(see Supporting Information).

Catalyst Preparation
The catalysts were prepared as
per previous reports.26,27 Montmorillonite (5 g) (CAS no.
1302-78-9) was slowly dispersed into the aqueous solution of ZrOCl2·8H2O (0.3 M, 80 mL) under stirring. Then,
the mixture was further stirred for 4 h at room temperature. After
the suspension was filtered for the desired time, the residue was
washed with distilled water until neutral (pH = 7) washing. The filtrate
was treated with AgNO3 to detect the presence of chloride
ion. Finally, the residue of Zr-Mont was dried at 100 °C overnight.
The dried catalyst was ground to powder in a mortar with a pestle
and stored in a glass bottle. Sn-Mont, Al-Mont, and Fe-Mont were also
prepared using the above method from their respective metal precursors,
SnCl4·5H2O, AlCl3·6H2O, and FeCl3·6H2O.

Catalyst Characterization
NH3-TPD experiment
was performed on a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2720 instrument. In this
experiment, 0.05 g of the catalyst was placed into a U-shaped, flowthrough
quartz tube. Then, the catalyst was pretreated with He with a flow
rate of 30 cm3/min at 200 °C for a period of 2 h.
Then, a mixture of NH3 in He (10%) was passed over the
catalyst with a flow rate of 30 cm3/min at 50 °C for
a period of 30 min. Subsequently, the sample was flushed with He with
a flow rate of 30 cm3/min at 50 °C for a period of
1 h. The TPD measurements were carried out in the range of 50–700
°C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1.
The desorbed ammonia concentration in the effluent was monitored with
a thermal conductivity detector. The nitrogen adsorption experiment
was also carried out on the same instrument. A PerkinElmer 2000 FTIR
spectrometer (4000–400 cm–1) attached with
a Harricks diffuse reflectance praying mantis assembly was used for
the recording of pyridine FTIR spectra of the prepared catalysts.
Before analysis, the self-supporting disk was dehydrated by heating
at 400 °C for a period of 1 h under N2 flow to remove
physisorbed water. The cell was cooled to room temperature, the self-supporting
disk (0.25 cm, radius) was filled with KBr, and the spectrum was recorded
as a background. After that KBr was replaced with the catalyst sample
(50 mg, weight) and placed in an IR cell attached to a closed glass
circulation system. Then, pyridine vapor was introduced into the cell
at room temperature until equilibrium was reached, and then, a second
spectrum was recorded. Evacuation was performed at different temperatures
for the period of 10 min and spectrum was recorded. Then, the obtained
spectrum was subtracted from the spectra recorded before pyridine
adsorption. The quantitative analysis of Brønsted acid and Lewis
acid was determined by using Emeis equations.25 Metal content in the catalyst was determined by using ICP–OES
analysis. For that purpose, desired weight of the catalyst was treated
with aqua regia (HNO3/HCl = 1:3) at 60 °C on a sand
bath for 2 h and then diluted up to 25 mL with distilled water. The
resultant sample was then analyzed by using an ICP–OES instrument.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Arylmethylfurfural from
HMF and Its Derivatives
HMF or HMF derivatives (e.g., FMF/AcMF/CMF/BMF)
(1 mmol) was dissolved in nitroethane (5 mL). Subsequently, mesitylene/xylene/toluene
(10 mL) and Zr-Mont (0.1 g) were added and the reaction mixture was
heated at 110 °C under stirring for the period of 16 h. After
complete conversion of the starting material, the reaction mixture
was filtered to separate the catalyst. The mother liquor was diluted
with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and partitioned by H2O (10 mL).
Subsequently, the organic phase was treated with anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The
residue was purified by column chromatography and eluted in petroleum
ether.

General Procedure for the
One-Pot Synthesis of Arylmethylfurfural
from Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates (e.g., sucrose/glucose)
(0.5 g) were dissolved in formic acid (5 mL). Subsequently, mesitylene/xylene/toluene
(10 mL) and Zr-Mont (0.2 g) was added and the reaction mixture was
heated at 150 °C under stirring for the period of 16 h. After
complete conversion of FMF (reaction key intermediate), the reaction
mixture was filtered to separate the catalyst. The mother liquor was
diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and partitioned by H2O (10 mL). Subsequently, the organic phase was treated with aq NaHCO3 (6 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Then, the organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure.
The residue was purified by column chromatography and eluted in petroleum
ether.

Analysis of the Reaction Products
Merck 5554 aluminum-backed
silica plates were used for thin-layer chromatography analysis, and
the compounds were visualized under UV light (254 nm). Conversion
of carbohydrates was calculated by using Agilent HPLC (column: Hi-Plex
H USP L17, detector: RI and mobile phase: Millipore water with 0.6
mL/min flow). Yields of dehydration product of carbohydrates and coupling
products were calculated by using Agilent HPLC (column: Poroshell
120 EC-C18 2.7 μm, detector: UV and mobile phase: 0.1% acetic
acid in Millipore water/acetonitrile (85:15; v/v) with 0.6 mL/min
flow). Pure products were characterized and confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR using CDCl3 (0.01%, TMS)
as the solvent on 200 and 50 MHz frequency Bruker instrument.
