We use first-principles density functional
theory calculations
to analyze the effect of chromia nanocluster modification on TiO2 rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces, in which both dry/perfect
and wet/hydroxylated TiO2 surfaces are considered. We show
that the adsorption of chromia nanoclusters on both surfaces is favorable
and results in a reduction of the energy gap due to a valence band
upshift. A simple model of the photoexcited state confirms this red
shift and shows that photoexcited electrons and holes will localize
on the chromia nanocluster. The oxidation states of the cations show
that Ti3+, Cr4+, and Cr2+ (with no
Cr6+) can be present. To probe potential reactivity, the
energy of oxygen vacancy formation is shown to be significantly reduced
compared to that of pure TiO2 and chromia. Finally, we
show that inclusion of water on the TiO2 surface, to begin
inclusion of environment effects, has no notable effect on the energy
gap or oxygen vacancy formation. These results help us to understand
earlier experimental work on chromia-modified anatase TiO2 and demonstrate that chromia-modified TiO2 presents an
interesting composite system for photocatalysis.

1 Introduction
Because
of growing global energy demands, the depletion of fossil
fuel resources, and climate change, the development of efficient materials
to convert abundant solar light into chemical fuels is an active research
topic. There is significant interest in using photocatalysts in the
transformation of solar energy to fuels.1−3 Of particular importance
are the conversion of water into hydrogen and the conversion of the
greenhouse gas CO2 into storable and usable hydrocarbon
fuels. The latter can contribute to addressing the problem of climate
change by coupling with CO2 capture to reduce emission
of CO2 into the atmosphere.

Absorption of light by
the photocatalyst excites an electron into
the conduction band states of the semiconductor photocatalyst.1−3 The resulting electron and hole charge carriers can migrate through
the photocatalyst and reduce or oxidize molecules. This process enables
the storage of solar energy into chemical bonds in, for example, hydrogen
or liquid fuels, which can be used whenever needed.

The most
widely studied material in photocatalysis over the last
40 years is TiO2. From a practical perspective, it is cheap,
shows good chemical stability, and is earth-abundant. From a fundamental
perspective, TiO2 shows catalytically active surfaces,
particularly in anatase, and a relatively high photosensitivity.1−8

However, there are some issues that have to be addressed to
produce
highly efficient devices. First, the photoabsorbance of TiO2 in the visible region of the solar spectrum is still too low for
the practical use of solar energy. This is due to the large band gap
of over 3 eV, which lies in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the solar
spectrum; UV makes up only 4% of the solar spectrum. The consequence
of this is a low efficiency. Second, the lifetime of the separated
charge carriers produced after light adsorption is too short and needs
to be increased to create electrons and holes that are available for
surface reactions over the time scales where catalysis operates.

To address these issues, conventional approaches have exploited
the effect of substituting other elements, so-called doping, into
the crystal structure of the host photoactive material. For TiO2, there has been a significant amount of work on both metal
and nonmetal (N, S, and F anions on oxygen sites) doping of TiO2.9−17 This work has primarily focused on band gap reduction to impart
a red shift in the absorption edge so that visible light can be absorbed.
However, doping of TiO2 has some issues with respect to
stability, reproducibility, and lifetimes, and even today, there are
still many issues with doping that are not fully resolved.

Of
particular interest for the present work is that chromium doping
has been demonstrated to play a role in red shifting light absorption
in TiO2. Peng et al.18 showed
how the absorption edge of TiO2 thin films shifts toward
longer wavelengths, that is a red shift, from 375 nm in undoped TiO2 to about 800 nm with increasing Cr concentration. This greatly
enhances the absorption of the solar spectrum of TiO2 nanomaterials.19,20 However, this doping approach can create defects arising from replacing
Ti with another metal or point defects that form to charge-compensate
the dopant, and these defects can act as recombination centers, which
then reduce the efficiency of the photocatalyst despite an apparent
visible light absorption.18−21

It has been found that to significantly increase
the photoabsorbance,
without impacting negatively the catalytic properties, a relatively
high doping level should be used, which can then cause a rapid degradation
of the crystalline structure.20 There are
thus some significant issues associated with doping of TiO2, which need to be addressed if it is to be used as a viable photocatalyst.
Some recent alternative approaches have included inducing a high degree
of reduction within TiO2, by incorporation of hydrogen,
the so-called “black TiO2”,22−24 modification with small-band-gap semiconducting quantum dots such
as CdS,25,26 and modification with metal particles to
exploit plasmon absorption in metal nanoparticles.27,28

A novel and very promising way to address the issues associated
with the photoactivity of TiO2 and doped TiO2 and improve the efficiency of photocatalytic devices is by nanocluster
(NC) modification of TiO2 surfaces using metal oxide nanoclusters
as the modifiers.29−31 The interaction between the TiO2 surface
and the oxide nanoclusters results in a strong interaction that forms
an interface between the surface and adsorbed nanocluster. The new
interfacial surface–nanocluster bonds can then modify the atomic
and electronic structure of clean TiO2. Instead of creating
new states in the band gap, which act as recombination centers, a
shift in either the valence or conduction band edge is induced, with
a consequent reduction of the energy gap between the highest occupied
and lowest unoccupied electronic states.5,32−35 In addition, these surface-modified composite structures can enhance
charge separation of electrons and holes with a consequent lengthening
of electron–hole lifetimes; this last point has been demonstrated
through photoluminescence experiments on surface-modified TiO2 systems.34,35 Finally, improved reaction rates
for molecular degradation have been observed under illumination in
both the visible and UV regions of the solar spectrum.

In an
experimental study, Irie et al.36 used
impregnation synthesis to prepare anatase TiO2 modified
with Cr2O3 by grafting Cr3+ ions
and forming supported amorphous Cr2O3 structures.
This composite structure showed promising results for band gap reduction
and charge separation, together with high chemical stability and greatly
enhanced performance over Cr-doped anatase. Photocatalytic activity
was evaluated by 2-propanol decomposition under visible light (1 mW
cm–1, between 450 and 580 nm), and this was improved
over the Cr-doped TiO2 system. These findings were attributed
to a reduction in charge recombination in the chromia-grafted system.
Although a direct observation of electron transfer from Cr2O3 to TiO2 upon excitation was not directly
shown, it was assumed to be the process involved. Such information
is crucial to determining the catalytic activity of the surface and
is therefore a fundamental objective of our analysis.

This article
thus presents a first-principles analysis of the properties
of Cr2O3-nanocluster-modified rutile and anatase
TiO2 surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) corrected
for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U), to gain
insights into the fundamental properties of the resulting composite
system. We consider first sub-nanometer, or low coverage of, chromia
nanoclusters of composition Cr2O3 and Cr4O6 adsorbed on rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces;
these are the most stable low-index surfaces of each form of TiO2. Furthermore, we also investigate the modification of “wet”
TiO2 surfaces, that is, surfaces that have been hydroxylated
by dissociation of water. The size of the nanocluster has been chosen
based on arguments in previous studies from our group,29−31,37−39 and these can
be considered as representatives of molecular-sized chromia nanoclusters.
In considering a practical photocatalyst, it is not enough to have
only light absorption in the visible region and one needs to consider
charge separation and the nature of the TiO2 support, whether
it be “dry/perfect” or “wet/with surface hydroxyls”
before surface modification with the nanoclusters. This allows us
to move toward, at least in part, more realistic catalytic conditions.
Water on TiO2 surfaces has been well-studied40−46 and at moderate coverages, such as 1/2 a monolayer (ML), can show
a mixture of hydroxyl groups and molecular water. Charge separation
is treated in a model of the photoexcited state to examine where electrons
and holes are likely to localize after photoexcitation,47−52 and this is crucial in studying possible recombination issues.

The final aspect addressed is the formation of oxygen vacancies
because TiO2 and Cr2O3 are reducible
and earlier work from our group53,54 suggests that O vacancies
can form with a low energy cost in the supported nanoclusters. In
addition, these defects represent potential sites for adsorption of
molecules and may be catalytically active and are thus of importance
for the properties of these composite materials.

The results
in this article show that the modification of rutile
and anatase TiO2 surfaces with small chromia nanoclusters
can induce a red shift in light absorption, irrespective of the nature
of the TiO2 surface, that is whether dry or modified with
water. The reactivity is also enhanced over both TiO2 and
Cr2O3, as measured by the high reducibility
of the composite structures. Formation of Cr6+ species
is not predicted. Chromia-modified TiO2 composites are
thus proposed as potential visible light-activated photocatalysts.

2 Results
2.1 Cr2O3 Nanocluster Modification
of Dry TiO2 Rutile (110) and Anatase (101) Surfaces
In this section, we analyze the properties of Cr2O3 nanocluster (NC)-modified rutile (110) and anatase (101)
surfaces, in which no water or point defects are present. The geometry
of each composite system has been determined by structural optimization
of two representative noncrystalline Cr2O3-nanoclusters,
with Cr2O3 and Cr4O6 stoichiometries,36 which have been relaxed in the gas phase within
the computational setup described in Section 2. These nanoclusters are adsorbed on the
rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces in different configurations
(see Figure S1, Supporting Information,
for other higher-energy structural isomers that we found; on the basis
of our earlier work,51,53,55 we expect that there to be little significant effect of the precise
structure on the properties of these composite systems), and the composite
nanocluster–TiO2 structures are relaxed with no
symmetry constraints. We calculate the nanocluster adsorption energies
on the TiO2 surfaces, relative to a free nanocluster and
a bare surface, as follows  where ECr2O3–TiO2, ETiO2, and ECr2O3 are the computed
total energies of the nanocluster-modified
TiO2 composite, the unmodified bare TiO2 surface,
and the free, stoichiometric chromia nanoclusters, respectively. In
the most stable adsorption configuration, the computed adsorption
energy of Cr2O3 on rutile (110) is Eads = −6.24 eV. For the Cr4O6 nanocluster, the computed adsorption energies are Eads = −4.24 eV on rutile (110) and Eads = −5.85 eV on anatase (101). The adsorption
energies show a strong interaction between the surface and the chromia
nanoclusters, and, as discussed in the previous work,55 these energies indicate that the nanocluster will remain
bound to the surface and will not aggregate into larger structures
that could reduce the effect of the surface modification.

After
nanocluster adsorption and structural relaxation, we observe the formation
of new interfacial Cr–O and Ti–O bonds between the surface
and the nanoclusters. Figure 1 shows the atomic structure of chromia nanocluster-modified
rutile (110) and anatase (101), whereas Figure S2 in the Supporting Information shows the key interatomic
distances, which we now briefly discuss and which are discussed in
detail in the Supporting Information. In
Cr2O3–rutile (110), the Cr cations are 4-fold-coordinated and bind to in-plane and bridging surface
oxygens in rutile (110). The 3-fold-coordinated oxygens in the nanocluster
bind to 5-fold-coordinated surface Ti atoms, with Ti–O distances
of 1.78 and 2.02 Å, and these Ti atoms migrate away from the
surface plane toward the nanocluster by up to 0.5 Å. The third
oxygen forms a chromyl Cr=O species, with a typical short Cr–O
distance of 1.60 Å. This is different to, for example, Fe2O3-modified rutile (110) from our earlier work,56 and if we use the most stable Fe2O3–rutile structure as input, this is less stable
after relaxation than the structure shown in Figure 1a.

Figure 1 Atomic structure of Cr2O3 and Cr4O6 nanoclusters adsorbed on the TiO2 rutile
(110) and TiO2 anatase (101) surfaces. The left panels
show a side view, the middle panels show a plan view, and the right
panels show the location of reduced Ti3+ and oxidized Cr4+ species, which are cyan and green, respectively. Structures
in panels (a)–(c) represent stoichiometric Cr2O3 adsorbed on rutile (110). Structures in panels (d) and (e)
represent stoichiometric Cr4O6 adsorbed on rutile
(110). Panels (f)–(h) represent stoichiometric Cr4O6 adsorbed on anatase (101). In this and all subsequent
figures, the red spheres represent oxygen atoms, blue-gray spheres
represent Ti4+, cyan spheres represent Ti3+,
dark blue spheres represent Cr3+ atoms, and green spheres
represent Cr4+ atoms.

In Cr4O6-modified rutile (110), the
two 4-fold-coordinated
Cr cations bind to bridging oxygen atoms in rutile (110) with Cr–O
distances of 1.82 and 2.02 Å. The other 3-fold-coordinated Cr
atoms do not bind to the surface. Lower coordinated Cr atoms have
generally shorter Cr–O distances, which is typical for structures
with low coordinated metal cations. There is one Ti–O bond
between a 5-fold-coordinated surface Ti atom and a 2-fold-coordinated
nanocluster oxygen (Ti–O distance = 1.78 Å), and this
Ti atom migrates out of the surface layer by 0.5 Å.

In
the Cr4O6–anatase composite, two
Cr cations bind to the oxygen in the anatase surface. One Cr cation
is 4-fold-coordinated and binds to a surface oxygen with a Cr–O
distance of 1.89 Å. The 4-coordinate Cr atom bridges two surface
oxygen atoms with Cr–O distances of 1.95 and 2.08 Å. There
is one Ti–O bond between the surface and the nanocluster, with
a Ti–O distance of 2.02 Å. Within the nanocluster, there
is a chromyl bond, to a 4-coordinate Cr cation, with a Cr–O
distance of 1.65 Å.

We observe that the more nanoclusters–surface
bonds that
are formed the higher the stability of the adsorbed chromia nanocluster,
for example, the Cr4O6–rutile system
has the fewest interfacial bonds and the lowest nanocluster adsorption
energy.

Figure 2 shows the
computed projected electronic density of states (PEDOSs) projected
onto the Ti 3d and Cr 3d states of the chromia composites, the O 2p
states of oxygen in the chromia nanoclusters, and the TiO2 surface. We also show the PEDOS of those Ti and Cr atoms with oxidation
states other than +4 and +3.

the Ti 3d and Cr 3d states in the Cr2O3–TiO2 composites (left column), the O 2p states of the adsorbed
chromia nanoclusters and TiO2 surfaces (middle column),
and the Ti3+ and Cr4+ states for Ti and Cr cations

(b) Cr4O6-modified rutile (110), and (c) Cr4O6-modified anatase (101). The zero of energy is
the Fermi level.

In all chromia–TiO2 composites, we find a strong
change around the valence-to-conduction band energy gaps when compared
to those in the unmodified rutile and
anatase surfaces. If we consider first the overall features of the
PEDOS, we see that there are new occupied electronic states derived
from both Cr 3d and O 2p present above the original valence band edge
of both TiO2 surfaces. Thus, the modification of rutile
and anatase with chromia nanoclusters results in an upshift of the
energy of the highest-lying occupied electronic states relative to
that of unmodified TiO2. The composition of these highest-energy
occupied states is consistent with the character of bulk Cr2O3 in which the valence band edge is composed of both
Cr 3d and O 2p states.

The upshift within our DFT + U computational scheme
is as large as 1.5 eV for rutile and 1.8 eV for modified anatase.
These shifts are clearly quantitatively dependent on the DFT functional
used (generalized gradient approximation (GGA), GGA + U, or hybrid DFT); the key point is that the chromia modification,
which introduces new interfacial bonds, shifts the position of the
highest occupied electronic states to higher energy. Thus, the energy
gap is reduced and absorption of light is shifted to longer wavelengths,
allowing for visible light absorption.

On examining the nature
of the conduction band edge, we see that
the TiO2 and chromia states are essentially isoenergetic
so that it is the modification of electronic states around the valence
band edge that produces the red shift in light absorption in chromia-modified
TiO2. This is consistent with and explains the results
of Irie et al.36

A closer examination
of the Ti 3d PEDOS of the Cr2O3−rutile
and Cr4O6−anatase
systems shows the appearance of a Ti 3d-derived electronic state that
lies inside the original rutile TiO2 valence-to-conduction
band energy gap, at ca. 0.8 eV above the rutile valence band edge
and 0.1 eV above the anatase valence band edge. This in-gap electronic
state is typical of a reduced Ti3+ species in the surface.57,58 There is no Ti3+ state present in Cr4O6–rutile.

To examine in detail the oxidation states
of Ti, Cr, and O in the
nanocluster and the TiO2 surfaces, we have computed the
Bader charges and spin magnetizables
on all atoms. For the Cr2O3–rutile system,
there is a surface 5-fold-coordinated Ti cation (indicated in Figure 1c) that has a computed
Bader charge of 1.70 electrons and a spin magnetization of 0.94 μB; for comparison, oxidized Ti4+ cations in these
systems have computed Bader charges of 1.3 electrons and zero spin
magnetization. The local geometry around this Ti site shows elongated
Ti–O distances of 2.03–2.08 Å, typical of a localized
Ti3+ site; this compares to 1.90–1.98 Å for
the remaining Ti4+ atoms. The in-gap electronic state,
the Bader charge, and spin magnetization for this surface Ti atom
are consistent with the formation of a reduced Ti3+ species.
We tested starting structures where this Ti was oxidized, but after
relaxation, this reduced species is found.

In the nanocluster,
the Cr cations have computed Bader charges
of 9.9 and 10.1 electrons, with corresponding computed spin magnetizables
of 2.20 and 2.9 μB. With a computed Bader charge
of 10.4 electrons and a spin magnetization of 3 μB for Cr3+ in bulk Cr2O3, these results
suggest the presence of one Cr3+ species and an oxidized
Cr4+ species. This then indicates the transfer of one electron
from the nanocluster to the rutile (110) surface.

In the Cr4O6–rutile structure, there
is no Ti 3d state in the TiO2 band gap. The computed Bader
charges and spin magnetizables for Ti cations in the rutile (110)
surface are +1.3 electrons and 0.0 μB, respectively,
which are consistent with Ti4+ species. The computed Bader
charges and spin magnetizations on Cr species in the nanocluster are
10.3, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.3 electrons and 3 μB (on
all Cr), respectively. These are consistent with the expected Cr3+ oxidation state in a nanocluster of this stoichiometry.

In Cr4O6–anatase, the new Ti 3d-derived
state lies less deep in the energy gap than the Ti3+ state
in the rutile (110) surface. The computed Bader charge is 1.70 electrons,
the spin magnetization is 0.96 μB, and the local
geometry around this Ti site shows elongated Ti–O distances
of 2.02 to 2.15 Å. Taken together, these results confirm the
presence of a Ti3+ cation in the surface, the position
of which is shown in Figure 1h. In the nanocluster, the Cr cations have computed Bader
charges of 10.4, 10.4, 10.3, and 10.1 electrons, with the corresponding
computed spin magnetizables being 3, 3, 3, and 2.1 μB. This thus indicates the presence of three Cr3+ species
and a single Cr4+ species, which is consistent with transfer
of an electron from the nanocluster to the anatase (101) surface.
The location of the Cr4+ species is shown in Figure 1h.

2.2 Nature
of the Photoexcited State in Cr4O6 Nanocluster-Modified
Dry TiO2 Rutile
(110) and Anatase (101) Surfaces
To study the localization
of photoexcited electrons and holes in chromia-modified TiO2, we use a model system in which a triplet electronic state is imposed.
The utility of this model in understanding electron and hole localization
in anatase bulk and (101),47 in hole localization
in ZrO2,50 and in our own work
on surface-modified TiO230,31,51,52 has been well-explored.
Enforcing a triplet spin configuration means that one electron occupies
a previously empty conduction band state and a hole is present in
the valence band, thus allowing the system to model a photoexcited
electronic state. As discussed in Section 4 on Calculation Methods, there are three quantities that we calculate:
the vertical, relaxed singlet–triplet, and the relaxation energies.
These are denoted Evertical, ES–T, and Erelax, and
the energies are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Computed Vertical Singlet–Triplet
Energy Difference, Evertical; Relaxed
Singlet–Triplet Energy Difference, ES–T; and the Relaxation Energy, Erelax,
in Cr4O6 Nanocluster-Modified TiO2 Anatase (101) and Rutile (110)a
structure	Evertical/eV	ES–T/eV	Erelax/eV	
rutile (110)	2.21	1.69	0.52	
anatase (101)	2.27	1.90	0.37	
Cr4O6–rutile (110)	2.14	1.30	0.84	
Cr4O6–anatase (101)	1.55	0.44	1.11	
a The energies for the bare surfaces
are included for comparison.

The vertical energy, Evertical, that
we have obtained for the modified surfaces is similar to the valence
band conduction band energy difference extracted from analysis of
the PEDOS. For chromia-modified TiO2, this value is smaller
when compared to that for the bare TiO2 surfaces, further
confirming the reduction in the energy gap after adsorption of the
nanocluster.

The singlet–triplet energy difference, ES–T, includes the effect of relaxing
the geometry
after promoting an electron to the conduction band; this value is
always smaller than the vertical singlet–triplet energy. This
calculation allows us to probe the localization of excited electrons
and holes. On both TiO2 surfaces, the effect of the Cr4O6 nanocluster modification is a decrease in the
singlet–triplet energy difference by 0.4 and 1.46 eV when compared
to that for the corresponding unmodified rutile (110) and anatase
(101) surfaces. Thus, we conclude that chromia modifications of TiO2 can induce a significant red shift of light absorption in
rutile or anatase, which is consistent with experimental work.36

The final energy is the relaxation energy, Erelax, which is an indicator of electron and
hole stability
after excitation. On Cr4O6–rutile and
Cr4O6–anatase, the relaxation energies
are 0.84 and 1.11 eV, respectively. Compared to those of the unmodified surfaces, these
energies suggest an enhanced trapping and stabilization of photoexcited
electrons and holes after chromia nanocluster modification of TiO2. This may help us to reduce charge recombination in these
composite systems.

Figure 3 shows the
atomic structure and location of the electron and hole sites in the
relaxed triplet electronic configuration for Cr4O6–rutile (110) and Cr4O6–anatase
(101). In the Cr4O6–rutile system, the
computed Bader charge of 10.5 electrons and the spin magnetization
of 3.5 μB show that a Cr2+ species forms
after electron localization on the Cr4O6 nanocluster.
The hole is found on a nanocluster oxygen atom (shown in yellow in Figure 3a) with a computed
Bader charge of 6.6 electrons and a spin magnetization of 0.7 μB that are typical of an oxygen hole species.59,60 The local geometry around the 4-fold-coordinated Cr2+ site shows Cr–O distances of 1.92–2.11 Å. Around
the oxygen hole, the Cr–O distances are 1.78 and 1.91 Å.

of Cr4O6-modified (a) rutile and (b) anatase.
Cr2+ sites are orange, Cr4+ sites are green,
O– sites are yellow, and Ti3+ sites are
cyan.

In Cr4O6–anatase, the computed Bader
charges and spin magnetizables on Cr are 10.39, 10.38, 10.3, and 10
electrons and 3.5, 3, 3, and 2 μB, respectively.
This indicates that the Cr cations have not changed oxidation states
upon excitation. The computed Bader charges for Ti show that two reduced
Ti3+ species are produced after excitation, as indicated
with the cyan spheres in Figure 3. The Ti3+ sites have computed Bader charges
and spin magnetizables of 1.71 and 1.72 electrons and 0.80 and 0.95
μB, respectively. The hole localizes on the chromyl
oxygen in the nanocluster with a computed Bader charge of 6.81 electrons
and a spin magnetization of 0.75 μB. The Cr–O– distance is 1.62 Å, which is a typical distance
for a cation–oxygen hole bond. Thus, upon excitation, the valence
band hole and conduction band electron can localize on the chromia
nanocluster modifier and anatase TiO2 surface. The electron
transfer proposed by Irie et al. in chromia-modified anatase may therefore
arise from the localization of excited electrons on the TiO2 surface. However, we note that for this particular composite system
the electron and hole are in close proximity, which is in contrast
to other modified TiO2 systems we have studied.31,38,39,51 Thus, electron and hole recombination could readily take place with
a consequent impact on the photocatalytic activity of the chromia–TiO2 composite system. On the other hand, the large relaxation
(trapping) energies of the electron–hole pair may mitigate
against this. We propose that the ideal electronic structure of these
composites would show valence and conduction band edge characters
that promote electron and hole separation rather than both being composed
of states from the nanocluster or the surface.

2.3 Oxygen
Vacancy Formation in Cr4O6 Nanocluster Modification
of Dry TiO2 Rutile
(110) and Anatase (101) Surfaces
Oxygen vacancy formation
energies were computed for each oxygen in the adsorbed chromia nanoclusters,
and the formation energies are shown in Table 2; Figure S3 in
the Supporting Information shows the numbering scheme for the oxygen
vacancies. For Cr4O6–rutile, we found
a very low energy, stable oxygen vacancy site (number III) with a
computed formation energy of 0.22 eV, whereas all other sites have
formation energies larger than 3 eV. This energy indicates that vacancies
can form at low temperatures, but the magnitude of the energy could
suggest that these may not be so reactive as the vacancy healing process
may be difficult. For Cr4O6–anatase,
the most stable oxygen vacancy has a computed formation energy of
1.95 eV, which would be a significant reduction over unmodified anatase
and bulk Cr2O3 and is large enough that this
vacancy will not be overstabilized and can act as an active site for
adsorption of molecules such as CO2. We have also calculated
the energy to form the second oxygen vacancy, and we obtain formation
energy of 5.86 eV for Cr4O6–rutile for
vacancy site V.

After vacancy formation in Cr4O6–rutile,
there is a substantial change in the atomic structure of the adsorbed
chromia nanocluster, shown in Figure 4. The key cation–oxygen distances are shown
in Figure S4, Supporting Information, and
the structural features are discussed in detail in the Supporting Information. Briefly, new bonds form
between three Cr atoms in the nanocluster and the surface oxygen (Cr–O
distances are 1.96, 1.98, 2.10, and 2.14 Å). New bonds form between
the surface Ti and nanocluster oxygen with these Ti migrating by 0.3–0.9
Å out of the surface layer. The formation of the vacancy facilitates
a very strong distortion to the nanocluster structure in which Cr
and O that were not bound to the surface now migrate toward the surface
to form new interfacial bonds. This is likely the origin of the low
vacancy formation energy, the cost to remove oxygen is compensated
by the gain in energy when new nanocluster-to-surface bonds are formed.

In the most stable oxygen
vacancy structure for Cr4O6–anatase,
the original chromyl oxygen binds with a
surface Ti atom (Ti–O distance of 2.08 Å). Another oxygen
in the nanocluster binds to surface Ti with a Ti–O distance
of 2.03 Å, and two Cr cations bind to the surface oxygen with
Cr–O distances of 1.85 and 1.96/1.99 Å, respectively.
Cr–O bonds in the nanocluster generally contract after the
vacancy formation, reflecting the reduced coordination of Cr in the
nanocluster.

The PEDOS plots are shown in Figure 5 for the most stable oxygen vacancy structure
in Cr4O6-modified rutile and anatase. In both
structures,
the general features of the PEDOS are very similar. There are nanocluster-derived
electronic states lying above the valence band edge of the TiO2 surfaces, and there are localized Cr 3d-derived peaks that
lie in the gap between the main Cr valence band peak and the empty
conduction band states.

with oxidation states other than Ti4+ and Cr3+ (right column). (a) Cr4O6-modified rutile
(110) and (b) Cr4O6-modified anatase (101).
The zero of energy is the Fermi level.

In defective Cr4O6–rutile, a
Ti 3d-derived
gap state is present. This Ti3+ species has a computed
Bader charge of 1.67 electrons and a spin magnetization of 0.9 μB, with Ti–O distances elongated by 0.2 Å compared
to the corresponding Ti4+–O distances. On Cr, the
computed Bader charges and spin magnetizables are 10.1, 10.2, 10.5,
and 10.5 electrons, and 3, 3, 3.7, and 3.7 μB, respectively.
Thus, the two electrons released by the oxygen vacancy localize onto
one subsurface Ti3+ site (typical for the Ti3+ species in rutile (110)61,62), and the second electron
spreads over two Cr sites (with the larger computed Bader charges,
green spheres in Figure 4) in the Cr4O6 nanocluster. The different Cr3+ and Cr2+ PEDOS peaks are apparent in Figure 5.

In the defective
Cr4O6–anatase (101)
composite, the Cr atoms have computed Bader charges and spin magnetizables
of 10.42, 10.8, 10.6, and 10.2 electrons and 3, 3.6, 3.5, and 2.1
μB, respectively. The Cr4+ species persists,
and two reduced Cr cations are reduced to Cr2+. The Ti3+ species found in the stoichiometric composite persists;
the computed Bader charge is 1.73 electrons, and the spin magnetization
is 0.98 μB. Thus, two Cr cations in the nanocluster
are reduced from Cr3+ to Cr2+ and no further
Ti reduction takes place.

If we examine the PEDOS plots for
the stoichiometric systems, we
see that there are empty Cr 3d states lying at the TiO2 conduction band edge so that electrons can be accommodated in these
states. The chromia nanoclusters can undergo more distortion than
the TiO2 surfaces upon reduction of Cr in the nanocluster
and thus it is generally more favorable for an electron to localize
onto Cr sites than onto surface Ti sites.

2.4 Effect
of Surface Water on Adsorption of Chromia
Nanoclusters on TiO2
In this section, we extend
the description of Cr2O3-modified TiO2 surfaces by including the effect of a surface in which water is
present before the nanocluster is adsorbed. This analysis can provide
insights into the effect of more realistic environmental conditions,
where water is always present. Water adsorption on oxide surfaces
has been well-studied, for example, refs (43−46, 63, and 64). In a previous study, we found that the presence of water, which
we model as adsorbed hydroxyls on rutile (110),30 can change the properties of TiO2 nanocluster-modified
rutile (110). For example, we found no red shift upon TiO2 nanocluster modification of a hydroxylated rutile (110) surface,30 in contrast to the modification of a perfect
rutile (110) surface with the same nanocluster.55 We attributed this to the passivation of singly coordinated
titanyl oxygen species with hydrogen that migrated from the surface
hydroxyls to the nanocluster. This passivation lowers the energy of
the TiO2 nanocluster states that were responsible for the
narrowing of the energy gap.

For the rutile (110) and anatase
(101) surfaces, we use a water coverage of 1/2 ML, which consists
of four dissociated water molecules adsorbed as surface-bound hydroxyls.
The aim here is not to analyze the most stable coverage and structure
of water on the respective TiO2 surfaces but to use a typical
water adsorption structure to compare with nanocluster modification
of the corresponding dry TiO2 surface. The computed adsorption
energies for Cr4O6 adsorbed on each wet surface
are −1.08 eV on rutile (110) and −2.21 eV on anatase
(101). Although these are reduced compared with Cr4O6 nanocluster adsorption on the nonhydroxylated rutile and
anatase surfaces, they nonetheless indicate that the chromia nanoclusters
can also adsorb at hydroxylated TiO2 surfaces.

Figure 6 shows the
relaxed geometry of rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces with 1/2
ML water coverage after the adsorption of the Cr4O6 nanocluster. The interatomic distances are shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information, and the structures
are discussed in detail in the Supporting Information. After structural relaxation, we observe proton migration from surface
OH groups (both terminal and bridging hydroxyls) to the adsorbed nanocluster.
New O–H bonds are formed with nanocluster oxygen, with typical
O–H distances of 0.98–1.0 Å. On hydroxylated rutile
(110), three protons from surface hydroxyls migrate to produce hydroxyl
bonds, whereas on hydroxylated anatase (101), two hydrogen atoms migrate
from the surface hydroxyls to make new OH bonds with the nanocluster.

Figure 6 Relaxed
atomic structure of the Cr4O6 nanocluster
adsorbed on (a, b) rutile (110) and (c–e) anatase (101), with
1/2 ML water coverage on each TiO2 surface. The left panels
show a side view, the middle panels show a top view, and the right
panels show the locations of Cr4+ and Cr2+ cations,
which are orange and green, respectively.

On rutile (110), there are two Ti–O bonds between
Ti in
the surface and oxygen in the nanocluster, with Ti–O distances
of 1.83 and 1.98 Å. The former atom migrated by 0.9 Å from
its surface lattice site to make a bridging bond with the nanocluster.
The Cr–O distances to the bridging oxygen in the surface are
1.95 and 1.82/1.91 Å; the longer Cr–O bond is to the bridging
hydroxyl oxygen. Within the nanocluster, Cr–O distances range
from 1.78 to 2.07 Å, with the lower coordinated Cr atoms showing
the shorter Cr–O distances. Finally, the Cr–O distances
to the hydroxyl oxygen are 1.80, 1.81, and 1.98 Å.

In the
Cr4O6–anatase system, two protons
have migrated from the surface hydroxyl groups to bind with the oxygen
in the Cr4O6 nanocluster. There are four Cr–O
bonds between the nanocluster and the surface. A 4-fold-coordinated
square planar Cr atom binds to two surface oxygens in anatase (101),
with a Cr–O distance of 2.06 Å, and to a surface hydroxyl,
with a Cr–O distance of 2.06 Å. Another 4-fold-coordinated,
square planar Cr atom binds to an original hydroxyl oxygen, with a
Cr–O distance of 2.0 Å. The final, tetrahedrally coordinated,
Cr atom has a Cr–O distance of 1.97 Å to a hydroxyl oxygen.
Within the nanocluster, Cr–O distances are in the range of
1.62 Å (chromyl oxygen) and 1.71 Å (3-fold-coordinated Cr)
to 2.08 Å.

On Cr4O6–rutile
(110), at 1/2 ML water
coverage, there is no formation of reduced Ti3+ species,
all Ti atoms have computed Bader charges of 1.3 electrons and zero
spin magnetizables. The computed Bader charges on Cr are all 10.3
electrons, with corresponding spin magnetizables of 3 μB, which is consistent with the presence of Cr3+ species. In Cr4O6–anatase, the computed
Cr Bader charges are 10.53, 10.3, 10.53, and 10.1 electrons, with
spin magnetizables of 3.6, 2.4, 3.6, and 2 μB. The
Ti Bader charges are 1.27–1.32 electrons with zero spin magnetization,
indicating that only Ti4+ species are present. The Cr Bader
charges and spin magnetizables indicate that oxidation states other
than Cr3+ are present. From these data, we propose a charge
disproportionation as follows: 4Cr3+ → 2Cr2+ + 2Cr4+, so that no Ti sites are reduced. We note that the Cr4+ sites
are 3-fold-coordinated and the reduced Cr2+ sites are 4-fold-coordinated.

The PEDOS plots in Figure 7 show similar general features to those of the Cr4O6-modified perfect surfaces. There are chromia-derived
electronic states lying above the valence band edge of the TiO2 surfaces. On hydroxylated anatase, the Cr2+ states
dominate the top of the valence band region, whereas the empty Cr4+ states dominate the bottom of the conduction band. In contrast
to the dry anatase (101) surface, the PEDOS further confirms that
there are no reduced Ti3+ species present with adsorbed
water on the TiO2 surface. Thus, the presence of water
on the modified TiO2 surface has no impact on the predicted
red shift of the absorption edge.

2.5 Formation
of Oxygen Vacancies in Cr4O6-Modified Rutile
(110) and Anatase (101)
Similar
to the modified perfect rutile and anatase surfaces, we have analyzed
oxygen vacancy formation by removing each oxygen in the nanocluster
and computing the formation energy, as given in Table 3. The numbering of the oxygen vacancy sites
is given in Figure S6, Supporting Information. The most stable oxygen vacancies have formation energies of +0.69
eV in Cr4O6–rutile (110) and +1.35 eV
in Cr4O6–anatase (101), which are suggestive
of significant reducibility in chromia-modified rutile and anatase,
so that this aspect of chromia-modified TiO2 is not impacted
by the presence of water on the TiO2 surface.

Figure 8 shows the
atomic structure of Cr4O6-modified hydroxylated
rutile (110) and anatase (101) after formation of the most stable
oxygen vacancy. The interatomic distances are shown in Figure S7, and the structures are discussed in
the Supporting Information. In Cr4O6–rutile (110), the formation of the vacancy does
not induce significant structural distortions compared to those in
the unhydroxylated surface. This is seen in the larger oxygen vacancy
formation energy when the surface is hydroxylated. Two Ti–nanocluster
bonds persist, with distances of 2.02 and 1.85 Å, with the latter
involving the surface Ti atom that migrates out of the surface. There
is a 3-fold-coordinated Cr that binds to the bridging surface oxygen,
with a Cr–O distance of 1.86 Å. A second Cr atom binds
to a hydroxyl oxygen and an oxygen, with Cr–O distances of
1.80 Å (to oxygen) and 1.89 Å (to hydroxyl oxygen). The
remaining Cr has Cr–O distances in the cluster of 1.81 and
1.96 Å to the hydroxyl oxygen and 1.93, 1.95, 2.04, and 2.06
Å to oxygen.

location of Ti3+, Cr4+, and Cr2+ species,
which are cyan, orange, and green, respectively. Structures representing
(a–c) Cr4O6 adsorbed on rutile (110)
and (d–f) Cr4O6 adsorbed on anatase (101).

On modified hydroxylated anatase
(101), the most stable vacancy
site in the nanocluster is not the chromyl oxygen site, which was
passivated by migration of hydrogen from the surface hydroxyl to the
nanocluster. A 3-fold-coordinated Cr cation binds to two hydroxyl
groups in the nanocluster with Cr–O distances of 1.83 Å
to the terminal hydroxyl and 1.92 Å to a bridging hydroxyl (the
second Cr–OH distance is 2.04 Å). A 4-coordinate Cr cation
has Cr–O distances to surface hydroxyls of 1.97 and 1.96 Å,
whereas the other 4-fold-coordinated Cr cation has Cr–O distances
of 2.03 and 2.07 Å to the surface, binding to the surface oxygen
and hydroxyls, respectively. Finally, there are no surface Ti-to-nanocluster
bonds.

The computed Bader charges show that in Cr4O6–rutile the formation of the oxygen vacancy leads
to the reduction
of a surface Ti cation and a nanocluster Cr cation. These have computed
Bader charges of 1.66 and 10.6 electrons, with computed spin magnetizables
of 0.94 and 3.7 μB, consistent with Ti3+ and Cr2+ oxidation states. Upon formation of the oxygen
vacancy in Cr4O6–anatase (101), there
are no reduced Ti3+ states formed. Instead, two Cr4+ cations are each reduced to Cr3+ and the remaining
Cr cations maintain their Cr2+ oxidation states. The computed
Bader charge on the Cr2+ cations are 10.8 and 10.7 electrons,
with a spin magnetization of 3.6 μB. The Cr3+ cations have Bader charges of 10.1 and 10.2 electrons with spin
magnetizables of 3 μB.

Figure 9 shows the
PEDOS projected onto the Ti 3d, Cr 3d, and O 2p electronic states
in Cr4O6–rutile and Cr4O6–anatase from the most stable oxygen vacancy structures.
In Cr4O6–rutile (110), the Cr4O6 electronic states that moved the valence band to a
higher energy persist and there is a new Ti3+-derived electronic
state that lies 1 eV above the valence band edge of the surface. The
PEDOS also shows the presence of Cr2+ states resulting
from Cr reduction after vacancy formation. In Cr4O6–anatase (101), formation of the oxygen vacancy does
not produce any Ti3+ electronic states in the energy gap,
consistent with the computed Bader charges. The different Cr oxidation
states are apparent in the PEDOS plot, with Cr2+ states
dominating at the valence band edge and empty Cr4+ states
dominating at the conduction band edge.

and TiO2 surfaces (middle column), and Ti 3d and Cr 3d

3 Conclusions
We have used DFT + U to study TiO2 rutile
(110) and anatase (101) surfaces modified with chromia nanoclusters,
taking into partial account the effect of the state of the surface
by modeling perfect and hydroxylated rutile and anatase surfaces (with
a water coverage of 1/2 monolayer). We have investigated the stability,
structure, electronic properties, oxidation states, and reducibility
of these composite systems. All nanocluster-modified surface composites
are stable, as determined by the computed adsorption energies. The
surface hydroxylation reduces the magnitude of the adsorption energy,
arising from the migration of hydrogen from surface hydroxyl to the
nanocluster and longer surface–nanocluster distances. The composites
show enhanced reducibility compared to that for the unmodified
TiO2 surfaces, irrespective of the state of the TiO2 surfaces, although the hydroxylated surfaces show slightly
larger formation energies and vacancy formation is more favorable
on chromia–rutile than on chromia–anatase.

The
electronic structure shows that chromia modifications will
red-shift light absorption due to the presence of chromia-derived
electronic states that lie above the valence band edge of TiO2. For a Cr4O6 nanocluster on dry anatase
(101), Ti+3 and Cr4+ species are present, but
for the same nanocluster on dry rutile (110), all Cr is in the +3
oxidation state and all Ti is in the +4 oxidation state. Similarly,
on hydroxylated TiO2 surfaces, oxidation states other than
Ti3+ and Cr4+ can be present.

On examining
the photoexcited state, we find that upon electron
and hole formation the electron and hole localization can depend on
the TiO2 surface. For modified rutile (110), the charges
localize on the chromia nanocluster, whereas on anatase (101), the
charges separate onto the nanocluster and the TiO2 surface.
In both cases, there is a clear red shift in the singlet–triplet
energies, indicative of a red shift in the absorption edge.

These results show that modification of rutile or anatase with
chromia nanoclusters can be used to red-shift light absorption and
induce reducibility in these composite structures. The effect of water
on the key properties of these composites is not notably strong. These
results also allow us to understand the experimental work of Irie
et al., including their observed red shift and electron transfer to
chromia.

4 Calculation Methods
The calculations
presented in this work are performed using a density
functional theory approach, within three-dimensional periodic boundary
conditions with a plane wave basis set to describe the valence electron
wave functions, as implemented in the VASP5.2 code.65,66 The PW91 generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the exchange-correlation
functional67 is used. We use a plane wave
cutoff energy of 396 eV. The core–valence electron interaction
is described by the projector augmented wave approach,68 in which we use 4 valence electrons for Ti,
6 for O, 12 for Cr, and 1 electron for H atoms. Methfessel–Paxton
smearing with σ = 0.1 eV is used in structure relaxations, and
energies are obtained for σ → 0. A (2 × 2 ×
1) Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling grid has
been used for a (2 × 4) expansion of the TiO2 rutile
(110) surface and a (4 × 2) expansion of the anatase (101) surface.
These have 18 and 12 atomic layers and a vacuum gap of 20 Å.
The convergence criteria for the energy and forces are 10 –5 eV and 2 × 10 –2 eV Å–2, respectively.

To correctly describe the partially occupied
Ti 3d, Cr 3d, and
O 2p electronic states, a Hubbard correction for the exchange-correlation
potential has been employed. The Ti 3d states are described with U (Ti 3d) = 4.5 eV. In describing localized oxygen 2p states,
we follow previous work and set U (O 2p) = 5.5 eV.30,31 The use of the Hubbard + U correction on the Ti
3d states becomes crucial when Ti3+ species form, and it
gives a consistent description of the electronic states and any polaronic
defects that can form in these systems. In addition, in previous studies,
we found that this correction is necessary to describe O 2p states
that result after valence band hole formation.30,31,69 Finally, the partially filled 3d states
in Cr also require a DFT + U correction to be consistently
described, and here, we use U (Cr 3d) = 3.5 eV,60 consistent with values used in other studies.

To analyze possible excited states, we perform a calculation in
which we impose a triplet electronic state on the chromia–TiO2 system. This allows us to model an “excited”
electron in the conduction band (and a hole in the valence band),
thus mimicking photoexcited states. Three fundamental energies can
be computed within this approach:

Evertical, which is computed as the
energy difference between the relaxed singlet ground state and the
unrelaxed triplet electronic state; this corresponds to the simple
valence–conduction band energy difference from the singlet
ground state;

ES–T, which
is computed from
the energy difference between the relaxed singlet ground state and
the relaxed triplet electronic state (i.e., the geometry is allowed
to relax in response to occupying a conduction band state with a corresponding
valence band hole); this can be thought of as an excitation energy
and indicates the effect of the surface modification on the absorption
edge;

Erelax, which is the energy
difference
between the unrelaxed triplet electronic state and the relaxed triplet
electronic state; this is the energy gained when the structure relaxes
upon trapping of the excited electron and the hole at preferred lattice
sites and gives an indication of the stability of trapped electrons
and holes.

A more detailed description of this methodology in
the context
of surface-modified TiO2 can be found elsewhere.30,31,51 Of course, this is a very simple
model of the photoexcited state and we cannot say anything about the
lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes and which processes,
such as de-excitation or electron transfer, will dominate in these
systems. Nonetheless, we can obtain useful information regarding the
preferred location of photogenerated electrons and holes and their
stability.

In the present composite structures, we have found
that the most
stable spin state is always that with the highest spin, which can
be up to 0.5 eV more stable than low-spin solutions. Thus, there is
an overall spin of 6 on Cr2O3 and a spin of
12 on Cr4O6 (3 spins per Cr cation). Thus, in
the triplet electronic state, we set the number of excess up-spin
electrons to 14.
