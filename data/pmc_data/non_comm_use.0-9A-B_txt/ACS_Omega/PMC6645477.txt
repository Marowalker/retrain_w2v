Limited light absorption, inefficient
electron–hole separation,
and unsuitable positions of conduction band bottom and/or valence
band top are three major critical issues associated with high-efficiency
photocatalytic water treatment. An attempt has been carried out here
to address these issues through the synthesis of direct Z-scheme Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO
heterostructures via a facile, fast, and economic method: solution
combustions synthesis. The photocatalytic performances are examined
by the 4-chlorophenol degradation test under simulated sunlight irradiation.
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis, electrochemical
impedance test, and the observed transient photocurrent responses
prove not only the significant role of Cs2O in extending
light absorption to visible and near-infrared regions but also its
involvement in charge carrier separation. Radical-trapping experiments
verify the direct Z-scheme approach followed by the
charge carriers in heterostructured Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO photocatalysts. The Z-scheme charge carrier pathway induced by the presence of Cs2O has emerged as the reason behind the efficient charge carrier
separation and high photocatalytic activity.

Introduction
One of the major technical
concerns of today is the treatment and
conservation of water. The great significance of this area lies in
its human need both in environmental and life aspects. Population
and industrial explosion all over the world severely affected water
bodies to a great extent and is now creating many ecological imbalances.
Recent years have witnessed development of numerous materials to solve
environmental issues and to conserve water and energy.1−3 As far as water bodies are concerned, different types of organic
pollutants are daily discharged into them, equally affecting the aquatic
and nonaquatic living beings. In order to keep the environment sustainable,
researchers are trying to remove these toxic organic pollutants using
solar energy.4 Although photocatalytic
water treatment has been a topic of investigation for several years,
it remains in the laboratory level because of various economic and
technical issues.5

Generally, when
the photocatalysis process occurs on a typical
semiconductor surface, two simultaneous reactions of oxidation and
reduction take place because of the photoinduced positive holes and
the negative electrons. Though numerous metal oxides such as TiO2, Fe2O3, ZnO, WO3, ZrO2, and so forth gained large popularity in photocatalysis,
they have been associated with several issues leading to decreased
efficiency and performance.6 At first,
some of these metal oxides (TiO2 and ZnO) have large band
gaps, preventing the absorption of visible light. Rapid electron–hole
(e/h) recombination and improper positions of conduction band bottom
(CBB) and valence band top (VBT) in some metal oxides are other two
issues associated with them. In order to overcome these issues, many
practices of modification/doping of metal oxide materials are being
practiced.7−12

Metal-oxide heterostructures attract remarkable current research
attention as they can extend the visible light absorption (if one
of the coupled semiconductors has a small band gap), suppress the
e/h recombination rate, and provide a platform to engineer the positions
of CBB and VBT.7,13,14 Normally, two main mechanisms are used to explain the charge carrier
migration pathway (i) formation of junctions at the interfaces among
the coupled metal oxides (heterojunction) and (ii) formation of Z-scheme systems (see the Supporting Information Scheme S1).8,15−17 The suitable mechanism is selected based on the energy structure
of the coupled semiconductors and the detected reactive species during
the photocatalysis process.

Efficiency of charge separation
enhances upon the formation of
typical junctions between the coupled semiconductors.18 However, in the heterojunction, the electrons transport
to the semiconductor with a more positive CBB, and the holes migrate
to the semiconductor with a more negative VBT, finally leading to
decrease the redox ability, and thus, negatively affects the photocatalytic
activity of the heterojunction.8,15,19 In contrast to this, the Z-scheme heterostructure
allows the migration of electrons to the semiconductor with a more
negative CBB and accumulation of the holes at the semiconductor with
a more positive VBT. This will provide a platform for a higher photocatalytic
activity.20,21 However, the Z-scheme heterostructure
requires electron mediators, mostly in the liquid form in the first
generation Z-scheme and noble metal in the second
generation.8 The liquid electron mediator
limits the applications of the first generation and the noble metal
electron mediator increases the cost of photocatalysts.15,22

Very recently, the third generation of the Z-scheme
came to the scenario as the most desired one for the photocatalytic
degradation of pollutants because it does not require electron mediators.15,23 To synthesize an efficient direct Z-scheme photocatalyst,
its components have to be selected carefully. The band gap, work function,
VBT, and CBB of the components should be calculated prior to the synthesis.
Another significant condition to be satisfied is that at least one
of the components should have a small band gap to extend the absorption
to the visible range.24 The CBB and VBT
have to be matched as well.25 The CBB potential
of at least one of the components should be negative enough over E0(•O2–/O2) (−0.046 eV vs normal hydrogen electrode),
and the VBT of at least one of the components should be more positive
than the standard redox potential of •OH/OH– or •OH/H2O (+1.99 eV).26−28 Obeying all these criteria, several direct Z-scheme
systems including g-C3N4-ZnO,29 g-C3N4/MnO2,30 AgI/Bi2Sn2O7,31 graphene quantum dots/ZnO nanowires,32 Fe2O3/Cu2O,33 and Cu2ZnSnS4–ZnO34 were synthesized and applied successfully in
photocatalytic applications.

The Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure reported
efficient photocatalysis toward degrading organic pollutants under
UV35,36 and visible light.37,38 In addition to this, ternary combinations based on Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructures such as Ag–Bi2O3–ZnO39 and
Bi2O3–CeO2–ZnO40 were also well established as efficient sunlight/visible
light-driven photocatalysts in photocatalytic water treatment. However,
the charge migration pathway in all these reported B2O3–ZnO-based heterostructures follows the heterojunction
approach which negatively affects the redox potential8 and thereby the photocatalytic activity. This substantiates
the need of suturing the semiconducting heterostructures to harvest
maximum efficiency of photocatalysis from them.

Herein, we prepare
a novel Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO
heterostructure using a simple solution
combustion synthesis (SCS)41−44 and explore its photocatalytic activity. SCS is considered
as a sustainable and green alternative to the widely used time- and/or
energy-consuming synthesis routes.45 By
this specific preparation, large-scale production of photocatalysts
in low cost is targeted to satisfy industrial requirements. The significance
of this ternary metal-oxide heterostructure is well-addressed by comparing
with the binary systems and pristine Cs2O under the
same conditions. The photocatalytic activities of all heterostructures
are examined by degradation of the 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) model pollutant.
The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO is explored by means of radical trapping
power tools. Moreover, the mechanism of the direct Z-scheme heterostructure is demonstrated clearly by substantiating
its applicability to all electromagnetic irradiations.

Results and Discussion
Crystal
Structure and Morphology
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO (sample CBZ15) and Bi2O3–ZnO
heterostructures (sample CBZ0) are compared in Figure 1a. The characteristics peaks of Cs2O appear on the spectrum of CBZ15 at 2θ = 18.2°, 25.7°,
and 42.51° (JCPDS 09-0104). The peaks at 31.69°, 34.83°,
and 36.16° for both CBZ15 and CBZ0 samples correspond to the
hexagonal phases of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). The remaining peaks observed
are due to the monoclinic phase of α-Bi2O3 (JCPDS 71-0465). These results confirm the successful formation
of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO and
Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructures.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns
of the samples CBZ0 (Bi2O3–ZnO) and CBZ15
(Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO), (b)
and (c) SEM, (d) TEM, and (e) HRTEM images
of the sample CBZ15.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs in Figure 1b,c show that the
Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO exhibits
a 3D sponge-like
structure with numerous irregular pores. The porous network is mainly
attributed to SCS during which gases were released.46 This porous structure is able to increase the pollutant
nanoparticle contact and accordingly enhances the photocatalytic efficiency.
However, the SEM images do not accurately provide the size and morphology
of individual nanoparticles, and this is rectified by the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of Figure 1d. The size of Bi2O3–Cs2O–ZnO nanoparticles is calculated using
imaging processing software ImageJ with the scale bar obtained during
TEM achievement as a reference to be <10 nm.

The lattice
fringe values of CBZ15 are further explored from the
high- resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 1e). The observed values of about 0.52, 0.32,
and 0.34 nm, respectively, correspond to the (002) plane of ZnO (JCPDS
card no. 36-1451),47 (121) plane of Bi2O3 (JCPDS card No. 71-0465),48 and the (012) plane of Cs2O (JCPDS card no.
09-0104).49 This result confirms the formation
of the Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO
heterostructure and is in good agreement with the XRD observations.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis
Formation
of the Z-scheme Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure is well explained by means
of XPS analysis as given in Figure 2. All characteristic peaks of Bi, Zn, Cs, and O are
seen in the spectra, without any additional impurities other than
the C 1s peak coming from the carbon tape in the XPS sample holder
(Figure 2a). There
are three O 1s peaks located at 530.4 (OI), 532.1 (OII), and 533.8 eV (OIII) (Figure 2b). While the OI is attributed
to the lattice O2, the OII and OIII are, respectively, due to OH and adsorbed H2O.33,50,51

Figure 2 (a) XPS survey of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO (sample CBZ15) and high- resolution
XPS of (b) O 1s,
(c) Zn 2p, (d) Cs 3d, and (e) Bi 4f of CBZ15.

In order to get a deep insight into the charge carrier migration
pathway, high- resolution XPS of Zn 2p, Cs 3d, and Bi 4f was carried
out (Figure 2c–e).
Both Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 are located, respectively,
at 1023.3 and 1046.4 eV (Figure 2c), which exhibit upward shifts compared to the standard
positions of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 for pure
ZnO.38 However, the binding energy difference
between Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 for the Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure
is observed to be 23.1 eV, which is almost the same for pure ZnO,
implying a normal state of Zn2+ in the Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure.52

For pure Bi2O3, the Bi 4f5/2 and
Bi 4f7/2 peaks are observed respectively at 163.9 and 158.6
eV,52 whereas, in the present case, these
peaks (Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f7/2) are found to
be upward-shifted to 164.9 and 159.6 eV, respectively (Figure 2e). The reported XPS peaks
of Cs 3d at 725.2 eV for Cs 3d5/2 and at 739.2 eV for Cs
3d3/253,54 are observed to be downward-shifted
to respective positions of 724.4 and 738.5 eV in the Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure (Figure 2d). In short, the
upward shifts observed in the positions of Zn 2p1/2, Zn
2p3/2, Bi 4f 5/2, and Bi 4f7/2, and
the downward shifts observed in the positions of Cs 3d3/2 and Cs 3d5/2 confirm that the electrons migrate from
the Bi2O3 CB and ZnO CB to Cs2O CB
(Scheme S1).15 These observed peak shifts also indicate a possibility of a strong
interaction between Cs2O, Bi2O3,
and ZnO.

Photocatalytic Studies
Photocatalytic activities of
synthesized Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO
are addressed using the colorless model organic contaminant 4-CP.
This organic compound is a toxic, poor biodegradable contaminant even
at low concentrations and widely observed in industrial wastewater
treatment.55,56 Moreover 4-CP is chosen as a
colorless pollutant to assure the absence of the sensitization effect
and hence to accurately evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the
prepared heterostructures. Figure 3a shows the time-dependent adsorption (in the dark)
and degradation of 4-CP by different samples under simulated solar
irradiation. A slight decrease in the concentration of 4-CP is noted
during the first 40 min of stirring in the dark because of the adsorption
of 4-CP on the surface of photocatalysts. However, the concentration
of 4-CP remains unchanged thereafter.

Figure 3 (a) Degradation curves, (b) kinetics of
the photodegradation,
(c) catalyst dosage effect, and (d) effect of the 4-CP concentration
on photocatalytic efficiency.

As illustrated in Figure 3a, coupling Bi2O3–ZnO
with Cs2O greatly enhances the photodegradation efficiency.
The photodegradation
percentages of 4-CP are, respectively, 50.9, 21.1, 45, 48.1, 40.2,
79.3, 95.6, 98.5, and 87% for the samples TiO2–P25,
Cs2O, Cs2O–ZnO, Cs2O–Bi2O3, CBZ0, CBZ5, CBZ10, CBZ15, and CBZ20 after 80
min exposure in simulated solar irradiation. Importantly, it is observed
that degradation efficiency increases with increasing the concentration
of Cs2O, and the highest photocatalytic degradation is
obtained at 15 mol % Cs2O. Beyond 15 mol % Cs2O, degradation performance remarkably decreases, indicating that
the 15 mol % Cs2O is the optimal concentration. Figure 3b shows the degradation
kinetics of 4-CP over Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO which follows a pseudo-first-order reaction. The k constants of different samples calculated from the slopes
of −ln(C/C0) plots
are 0.019, 0.038, 0.053, 0.0238, 0.008, 0.0072, 0.0067, 0.0052, and
0.0026 min–1 for CBZ5, CBZ10, CBZ15, CBZ2, TiO2–P25, Cs2O–Bi2O3, Cs2O–ZnO, CBZ0, and Cs2O, respectively.
Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructures
(CBZ5, CBZ10, CBZ15, and CBZ20) show higher sunlight photocatalytic
performance when compared to the standard photocatalyst TiO2–P25, whereas the binary heterostructures (Cs2O–Bi2O3, Cs2O–ZnO, and Bi2O3–ZnO) exhibit lower photocatalytic activity.
Finally, the degradation efficiency monitored is following the trend
CBZ15 > CBZ10 > CBZ20 > CBZ5 > TiO2–P25
> Cs2O–Bi2O3 > Cs2O–ZnO
> CBZ0> Cs2O (i.e., the degradation efficiency of
Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO >
TiO2–P25 > Cs2O–Bi2O3 > Cs2O–ZnO > Bi2O3–ZnO
> Cs2O).

Effect of Catalyst Dosage
The catalyst
dosage is an
important parameter to explore the pollutant degradation mechanism.57−59 To study the effect of catalyst dosage on degradation efficiency,
the degradation reaction was repeated using different concentrations
of the sample CBZ 15 under identical conditions, and the results obtained
are displayed in Figure 3c. It can be seen that photocatalytic efficiency increases with increasing
the catalyst concentration from 0.1 to 0.4 g/L. Beyond 0.4 g/L of
catalysts, the photocatalytic degradation of 4-CP decreased, implying
this specific concentration as the optimal catalyst dosage.

The increase in 4-CP degradation with respect to catalysts is due
to increasing the number of photocatalytic active sites, whereas the
decrease in photocatalytic degradation after the optimal catalyst
dosage is due to the light scattering by the catalyst particles that
affect light absorption and thus the number of produced reactive species.

Effect of Initial Concentration
The effect of initial
4-CP concentration on the photodegradation ability of the Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure was
examined by varying the concentration from 10 to 50 mg L–1 under 80 min of simulated solar irradiation. As shown in Figure 3d, the photocatalytic
degradation efficiency decreased with increasing the initial concentration
of 4-CP. Higher 4-CP concentration causes more molecules to be present
around the photocatalytic active sites and thus inhibits light penetration
to the catalyst surface and reduces the e/h pair generation. As a
result, the generation of •O2– and •OH is reduced and hence the photocatalytic
performance.60

Reusability and Mineralization
Degree
The photostability
of the heterostructured Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO photocatalyst is investigated by reusing it (sample
CBZ15) for five sequential cycles. As displayed in Figure S1a, a negligible decrease in 4-CP degradation performance
is observed even after five consecutive cycles, confirming the superior
photostability of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO.

To further validate the photostability of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO, the XRD pattern
of the optimized Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure (sample CBZ15) is recorded before the
photocatalysis experiment and after five cycles of photodegradation. Figure S1b shows that there is no remarkable
change in the XRD pattern after the fifth cycle of photodegradation.
The observed photostability is benefited from the direct Z-scheme charge carrier migration pathway;23 that is, the photogenerated electrons in ZnO and Bi2O3 are consumed by recombination with the photogenerated holes
in the VB of Cs2O.

The total organic carbon (TOC)
test is an essential index for exploring
the mineralization degree of an organic pollutant.61 To clarify whether 4-CP was mineralized or degraded by
the heterostructured Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO, TOC analysis was adopted. The degradation and mineralization
of 4-CP under simulated solar irradiation as a function of time were
compared and are presented in Figure S1c. Apparently, about 82% of 4-CP was mineralized in 80 min, indicating
the powerful photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure synthesized.

UV–Vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy Studies
To
investigate the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO, UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was recorded for various samples. As
shown in Figure 4a,
the coupling between Cs2O and Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructures resulted in significant enhancement
in light absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions.
The highest light absorption is exhibited by Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO with 15 mol % Cs2O (sample
CBZ15), and this is the major reason for its highest photocatalytic
degradation efficiency. In other words, the enhancement in light absorption
increases the number of photogenerated electrons and holes, increases
the number of active species (•OH and •O2–), and thereby improves the photocatalytic
activity.

Figure 4 (a) DRS UV–vis spectra, (b) photocurrent response, (c) and
electrochemical impedance measurements of the prepared samples.

Electrochemical Studies
The photocurrent response is
an important criterion to assess e/h separation and the photocatalytic
activity.62,63 The role of Cs2O was further
investigated by monitoring the photocurrent responses of the Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure (sample CBZ0) and
Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructures
(samples CBZ5, CBZ10, CBZ15, and CBZ 20). The results obtained are
represented in Figure 4b. The photocurrent density of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO samples increases to a maximum value and
then slowly declines and achieves a steady state. Apparently, the
Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure (sample CBZ0)
shows low photocurrent density, indicating the quick e/h recombination
in it, whereas Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO
heterostructures (samples CBZ5, CBZ10, CBZ15, and CBZ20) show notable
enhancement in photocurrent responses. This is attributed to the enhancement
of separation efficiency of photogenerated e/h through the electronic
interaction among Cs2O, Bi2O3, and
ZnO. The highest photocurrent intensity and highest 4-CP degradation
efficiency obtained for the sample CBZ15 confirm the significant role
of charge separation in enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

For further validating the efficiency of photogenerated e/h separation,
electrochemical impedance values were checked for all fabricated heterostructures
(Figure 4c). Compared
to other samples, CBZ0 displays the largest arc radius in the electrochemical
impedance Nyquist plot, demonstrating its high interfacial charge
transfer resistance and low charge separation efficiency. The samples
CBZ5, CBZ10, CBZ15, and CBZ20 exhibit a significant decrease in the
arc radius of the Nyquist plot, confirming the low interfacial resistance
and high charge-carrier separation efficiency.64 Obviously, the sample CBZ15 shows the smallest arc radius
and thereby achieves the highest charge-carrier separation efficiency.
Electrochemical impedance values thus well agree with the results
of photocurrent responses. Thus, the electrochemical studies reveal
the impact of Cs2O on the proactivity properties of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructures.

Band Position Determination and Charge Carrier Migration Pathway
Estimating the CBB and VBT is vital to evaluate the potential of
a photocatalyst for pollutant degradation. Figure 5a shows UV–vis DRS spectra of pristine
Cs2O, Bi2O3, and ZnO. Cs2O shows the highest visible light absorption followed by Bi2O3. The band gaps (Eg) are
calculated from Tauc’s plot65 as
shown in Figure 5b,c
to be 1.92 eV for Cs2O (direct band gap), 3.1 eV for ZnO
(direct band gap), and 2.76 eV for Bi2O3 (indirect
band gap). The CBB and VBT are calculated using the following equations
and presented in Table S1.    where
χ is electronegativity and EH represents
the energy of free electrons on
the hydrogen scale.66 Furthermore, the
VBT was estimated using valence band XPS analysis as shown in the
supporting information Figure S2 to be
0.42, 2.88, and 2.82 eV for Cs2O, Bi2O3, and ZnO, respectively. The CBB was calculated and is presented
in Table S2. The CBB was found to be −1.5,
0.12, and −0.28 eV for Cs2O, Bi2O3, and ZnO, respectively.

Figure 5 (a) UV–vis DRS spectra of Cs2O, Bi2O3, and ZnO and the Tauc’s
plot of (b) Cs2O and ZnO, and (c) Bi2O3.

On the basis of these results,
the position of the Cs2O CBB (−1.5 eV) is more negative
compared to the Bi2O3 CBB (0.12 eV) and ZnO
CBB (−0.28 eV). Thus,
electrons are supposed to move from the Cs2O CB to Bi2O3 CB and ZnO CB if Cs2O–BiO3–ZnO is a heterojunction system (see Scheme 1). However, the high- resolution
XPS analysis indicates that the electrons migrate from the Bi2O3 CB and ZnO CB to Cs2O CB. Hence,
Cs2O–BiO3–ZnO is not a heterojunction
system.

Scheme 1 Comparison of the Charge Carrier Migration Pathway in Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO Based on Heterojunction
and Z-Scheme Approaches
In fact, the electron migration pathway is better explained
by
the Z-scheme approach as depicted in Scheme 1; that is, under irradiation
with the appropriate wavelength of light, the electrons are promoted
from the VB of each semiconductor (Bi2O3, ZnO,
and Cs2O) to its VB, leaving holes behind. Then, the electrons
migrate from the CB of ZnO to the CB of Bi2O3 because the CBB potential of Bi2O3 (0.12 eV)
is more positive than that of ZnO (−0.28 eV). Meanwhile, the
electrons of the ZnO CB and Bi2O3 CB combine
with holes in the Cs2O VB. The electrons do not stop at
the Cs2O VB, but they are photoexcited to the Cs2O CB. This process continues under appropriate irradiation, leading
to high enhancement in the charge separation.

Mechanism of Pollutant
Degradation
To understand the
charge migration pathway and the photocatalytic degradation mechanism
of 4-CP, trapping experiments were performed to identify the main
radicals responsible for the degradation process. To trap the free
radicals, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) was used as an •OH scavenger and benzoquinone (BQ) as an •O2– scavenger.67 In addition, KI and AgNO3 were used as holes and electrons
scavengers, respectively.68

The photocatalytic
degradation of 4-CP over the sample CBZ15 was repeated under identical
conditions in the presence of BQ and TBA separately. As displayed
in Figure 6a, a remarkable
inhibition of 4-CP photodegradation in the presence of BQ suggests
the prominent role of •O2– reactive species in 4-CP photocatalytic degradation. In addition
to this, the drastic decrease in degradation of 4-CP in the presence
of TBA indicates the significant role played by •OH radicals also in the photodegradation of 4-CP over the Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO photocatalyst.
In contrast, the addition of KI (hole scavengers) led to significant
enhancement in the degradation efficiency of Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO; 99.2% of 4-CP was degraded in 60
min only,and this is attributed to improvement in the charge separation
efficiency, that is, the absence of holes reducing the recombination
rate of e/h, and thereby increases the concentration of electrons
which react with O2 to produce •O2–. However, no significant effect on photodegradation
was observed in the presence of AgNO3, indicating that
the electrons do not play a direct role in the photodegradation process.

experiments, (b) PL spectral changes observed
during the irradiation of the CBZ15 sample in the presence of 5 ×

DMPO–•O–2 of
the CBZ15 sample in methanol dispersion upon simulated sunlight illumination,
and (d) schematic diagram showing the energy band structure and the
proposed photocatalytic mechanism of the Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure.

The formation of •OH-free radicals was
further
confirmed by liquid photoluminescence (PL) detection through the reaction
of •OH with terephthalic acid (TA).69Figure 6b shows the changes in PL spectra of the TA solution in the presence
of CBZ15 with simulated sunlight irradiation. A time-dependent increase
in PL intensity with a peak at about 425 nm is observed, confirming
the production of •OH.

To further endorse
the formation of •O2–, spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR)
was used to detect •O2– formation by employing a 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) free radical trapping agent in methanol.70−73 The ESR signals of CBZ15 under simulated solar light irradiation
and in the dark were recorded and are represented in Figure 6c. No peaks were observed in
the dark, whereas the characteristic peaks of DMPO–•O2– appear under simulated sunlight
irradiation with increased intensity with irradiation time. This indicates
the formation of •O2– under simulated sunlight irradiation.

On the basis of all
these results, a typical pollutant degradation
mechanism is designed for Cs2O–Bi2O–ZnO
heterostructures as shown in Figure 6d. The charge transportation in heterostructured photocatalysts
is generally explained by one of the two mechanisms— the heterojunction
mechanism or Z-scheme mechanism.74 Evidence obtained from XPS results reveals the nonapplicability
of the heterojunction mechanism in explaining the charge carrier migration
pathways in Bi2O3–ZnO–Cs2O. If the heterojunction mechanism is followed, the electrons are
supposed to be accumulated in the CB of Bi2O3 which has the lowest CBB among the three metal oxides. However,
the potential of the CBB of Bi2O3 is not sufficient
to produce •O2–40 radicals confirmed from the spin-trapping ESR
experiments, thereby discarding the possibility of the heterojunction
mechanism. In contrast, the Z-scheme mechanism can
explain the charge transporting processes in Bi2O3–ZnO–Cs2O heterostructures very well. Under
simulated sunlight irradiation, all Bi2O3, ZnO,
and Cs2O absorb light energy according to UV–vis
DRS spectra and generate e/h pairs. The electrons will then migrate
from the CB of Bi2O3 and the CB of ZnO and combine
with holes in the VB of Cs2O. Hence, the e/h pairs are
efficiently separated. The CBB potential of Cs2O (−1.5
eV) is more negative than the redox potential of O2/•O2– (−0.046 eV).26

Thus, the electrons accumulated in the
CB of Cs2O exhibit
strong reducibility and easily reduce O2 into •O2–. At the same time, the holes retained
in the VB of ZnO show enough oxidability to oxidize H2O
into •OH radicals because the VBT potential of ZnO
is more positive than the redox potential of •OH/OH– or •OH/H2O (+1.99 eV).27 The Z-scheme mechanism thus
clearly evidences photodegradation of 4-CP, supported by the scavengers,
PL, and spin-trapping ESR results. Therefore, all the results strongly
indicate that the Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure follows the direct Z-scheme mechanism rather than  the heterojunction mechanism.

Conclusions
Novel Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO
heterostructures consisting of nanoparticles of <10 nm size were
synthesized by means of the solution combustion method. The concentration
of Cs2O was varied to derive the maximum photoactivity
of the heterostructure, and an optimal ratio is observed at 15 mol
% Cs2O. The fabricated Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO heterostructure showed a superior photocatalytic
activity and photostability by degrading the model organic pollutant
4-CP. High- resolution XPS analysis and radical scavengers/trapping
experiments were used to confirm the direct Z-scheme
charge migration mechanism in the heterostructure. The direct Z-scheme charge migration pathway not only enhances the
charge separation efficiency but also causes the accumulation of photogenerated
electrons and holes in the corresponding energy bands (CB/VB) with
the highest redox potential. The novel Cs2O–Bi2O3–ZnO structures fabricated were able to
absorb UV, visible, and NIR wavelengths, confirming their applicability
toward any radiation. It is also anticipated that these kinds of heterostructures
can be used not only for photocatalytic degradation but also for different
applications including H2 and O2 production,
reduction of CO2, and sensing.

Experimental Section
Materials
CsNO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99%), Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), glycine
(Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and 4-CP (Alfa Aesar, 99%) were of analytical
grade and used as received. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) was
used in the experiments.

Synthesis Method
An appropriate
amount of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was
dissolved in 1.2 M
HNO3 to form 30 ml of 1.18 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in a separate beaker (BS), and 30 ml of 0.82
M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was prepared
separately in a beaker (ZS). Equal volumes of BS and ZS were mixed
in five separate beakers. A different quantity of CsNO3 was added to each beaker in a way to obtain 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20
mol % Cs2O, and the corresponding samples were labeled
as CBZ0, CBZ5, CBZ10, CBZ15, and CBZ20, respectively (oxidizer). The
appropriate amount of glycine as a fuel was added to each beaker in
such a way that the fuel/oxidizer valence ratio of the mixture equals
one. Each solution was stirred for 30 min and heated on a hot plate
at 320 °C. After dehydration, the solution started to boil, foam,
and then ignite. The obtained powder was light orange. Cs2O, Bi2O3, ZnO, Cs2O–Bi2O3, and Cs2O–ZnO were prepared
using the same procedure.

Characterizations
The crystal patterns
were recorded
using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku smart Lab-II, Cu
Kα radiation, λ = 1.5414 Å). The morphology of the
prepared samples was investigated using SEM (Hitachi-3400N) and HRTEM
(Jeol/JEM 2100). XPS spectra of the samples were obtained using an
ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Scientific instrument. DRS UV–vis spectra
were recorded using a Thermo scientific Evolution 201 UV–visible
spectrophotometer. A JES FA200 spectrometer was used to examine the
ESR signals of spin-trapped radicals.

Photocatalytic Test
The photocatalytic activities of
the prepared heterostructures were examined toward the degradation
of 4-CP as a colorless pollutant model under simulated sunlight irradiation.
A 300 W Xenon lamp was used as the light source. Typically, 0.04 g
of the prepared catalyst was dispersed in a separate reactor containing
100 mL 4-CP (10 mg/L). The suspension was stirred in the dark for
1 h to accomplish the desorption–adsorption equilibrium before
being illuminated. About 3 mL of the suspension was sampled at every
20 min and subjected to centrifugation to remove the photocatalyst.
A Beckman Coulter DU 730 UV–vis spectrophotometer was used
to measure the concentration of 4-CP, whereas its mineralization degree
was measured on a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-V CPN).

Electrochemical
Studies
Photocurrent measurements for
the fabricated heterostructures were carried out using a CHI 608e
electrochemical analyzer. Fluorine-doped tin oxide glasses spin-coated
with the prepared heterostructures were used as working electrodes.
A platinum wire and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter and reference
electrodes, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 was used as the
electrolyte during the photocurrent measurements. The working electrode
was irradiated at 100 mW cm–2 obtained from a 300
W xenon lamp, and the photocurrent was measured at 0 V during light
on-off cycling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried
out using the same setup at an open circuit potential with an ac voltage
magnitude of 5 mV over the frequency range of 105 to 1
Hz.
