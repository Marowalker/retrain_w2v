A series
of chalcone and heterocyclic isosteres, in which the enone
moiety was replaced with an isoxazole and pyrazole ring system, was
synthesized and their affinities for alpha synuclein (Asyn), amyloid
beta (Aβ), and tau fibrils were measured in vitro. The compounds
were found to have a modest affinity and selectivity for Asyn versus
Aβ fibrils and low affinity for tau fibrils. Insertion of a
double bond to increase the extendable surface area resulted in an
increase in affinity and improvement in selectivity for Asyn versus
Aβ and tau fibrils. The results of this study indicate that
compound 11 is a secondary lead compound for structure–activity
relationship studies aimed at identifying a suitable compound for
positron emission tomography-imaging studies of insoluble Asyn aggregates
in Parkinson’s disease.

Introduction
The accumulation of
insoluble protein aggregates is the hallmark
feature of most neurodegenerative disorders. For example, Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of two different protein
aggregates, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).1 Amyloid plaques are formed by the misprocessing
amyloid precursor protein to form Aβ1-42, and the misfolding
of this protein from an alpha helix to a beta pleated sheet causes
aggregation to form fibrils, which precipitate in the form of amyloid
beta (Aβ) plaques. NFTs are caused by the fibrillization of
hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein, which is
thought to be formed later in the disease process than Aβ plaques.
For many decades, the identification of patients having AD was not
confirmed until autopsy, a diagnosis that was based on the density
of amyloid plaques and NFTs in various brain regions. There was a
breakthrough in the clinical characterization of AD with the development
of radiotracers such as [11C]PiB and [18F]florbetapir,
which are capable of providing a measure of amyloid plaques in living
human brain in conjunction with positron emission tomography (PET).2−4 More recent efforts have focused on the development of PET radiotracers
for imaging aggregated tau in NFTs, and PET-imaging studies have confirmed
that NFTs are formed much later in the disease process than Aβ
plaques.5−7

A second neurodegenerative disease characterized
by insoluble protein
aggregates is Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this case, the protein
alpha synuclein (Asyn), a highly abundant protein in brain, is not
degraded and leads to a similar formation of beta pleated sheets and
fibril formation. The Asyn fibrils eventually form two different insoluble
protein aggregates, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which have been
used to characterize PD at the time of autopsy.8−10 Lewy bodies
and Lewy neurites are also found in another Parkinsonian-like syndrome
termed dementia with Lewy bodies and in glial cell inclusion bodies
in multiple system atrophy. Taken collectively, these neurodegenerative
disorders have been termed “synucleinopathies” because
they have as a common feature the formation of insoluble protein aggregates
of fibrillary Asyn.11

The tremendous
success in the application of Aβ and tau imaging
agents in the study of AD has led to an international effort to develop
a PET radiotracer for imaging Asyn aggregates in Lewy bodies, Lewy
neurites, and glial cell inclusion bodies. A limitation in the development
of PET radiotracer for this purpose has been the dearth of lead compounds
to serve as a starting point for structure–activity relationship
(SAR) studies aimed at developing an optimized probe for translational
imaging studies. Because Aβ and tau pathologies are often observed
in postmortem samples of PD brain, it is important that a PET radiotracer
for imaging Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites displays high selectivity
for aggregated Asyn versus Aβ and tau.12 This topic has been discussed in greater detail in a recent review.11

We previously reported the synthesis and
in vitro characterization
of a panel of indolinone–diene analogues as potent and selective
ligands for Asyn versus Aβ and tau fibrils.13 A limitation of this class of compounds is the tendency
of some of the analogues to isomerize into E,E and Z,E isomers and
their high lipophilicities, which limits their utility as a radioligand
for PET-imaging studies.

For the current study, we chose to
investigate a series of chalcone
derivatives because the enone moiety serves as an isosteric replacement
of the diene group while avoiding the E,E and Z,E isomerization problem
observed with the indolinone–diene analogues. Chalcone analogues
have been previously reported to bind to Aβ but had a low affinity
for Asyn.14,15 We also replaced the indole ring system
with a benzothiazole ring system because our previous SAR study revealed
that an electron-deficient ring such as the aza-indole system has
a higher affinity for Asyn fibrils relative to the indole ring system
(Figure 1; 1–3).13 The benzothiazole ring system is
also present in cyanine dyes that have been shown to bind to Asyn
fibrils (Figure 1; T-284 and SH-516).16 Finally, we replaced the enone moiety with an isoxazole and pyrazole
ring system to avoid the Michael-acceptor properties of the chalcone
system. We utilized thioflavin T (ThioT) competition assays to characterize
the binding affinity, an approach we previously utilized for phenothiazine
and indolinone–diene compounds to guide the identification
of lead compounds for radiolabeling and further characterization.13,17,18 The results of in vitro binding
studies led to the identification of compounds having a higher affinity
for Asyn versus Aβ and tau fibrils. Molecular-modeling studies
were also conducted to identify the properties of the ligands contributing
to this selectivity. Although the compounds described in this report
do not have the high affinity to serve as a PET radiotracer for in
vivo imaging studies, they could serve as secondary lead for further
SAR studies.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis
of the target compounds involved a simple condensation
reaction with 2-acetylbenzothiazole and the substituted benzaldehyde
(Scheme 1). We chose
to explore only the 4-OCH3, 4-N(CH3)2, and 4-NO2 substituted compounds because our previous
studies indicated that these were preferred substituents in the indolinone–diene
series.13 In vitro binding studies revealed
that the benzothiazole chalcone analogues had only a modest affinity
for Asyn fibrils and a slightly higher affinity for Aβ fibrils
(Table 1 and Supporting Information Table). The calculated
log P values were also higher than those of the corresponding
indolinone–diene analogues, which is also an undesirable property
for a PET radiotracer for brain-imaging studies.

The
next step in the process involved removal of the benz-fused
aromatic ring to make the corresponding thiazole chalcone analogues
(7, 8, and 9; Scheme 1). We were quite surprised
to see that this simple change in structure resulted in an increase
in affinity for Asyn and improved selectivity for Asyn versus Aβ
and tau fibrils. Of the three derivatives, the 4-methoxy group had
the highest potency for Asyn (Ki = 53
nM) and the highest selectivity for Asyn versus Aβ and tau fibrils.

The isosteric replacement of the enone moiety of compound 7 with a five-membered heterocyclic ring was also explored.
The rationale for this substitution was the publication of the pyrazole
analogue, anle138b (Figure 1), which was reported to have a modest affinity
for Asyn fibrils.19,20 Therefore, both the pyrazole
and isoxazole analogues of compound 7 were synthesized
and evaluated in vitro for binding to Asyn, Aβ, and tau fibrils
(Scheme 2). The results
of in vitro binding studies revealed that the pyrazole (12) and isoxazole (10) analogues had an affinity for Asyn
similar to that reported for anle138b (Ki = 190 nM) and good selectivity versus Aβ and tau
fibrils (Table 2).
As a final structural change, a double bond was inserted between the
central heterocyclic ring system and the 4-methoxyphenyl ring. The
synthesis of the target compounds is shown in Scheme 2. Although the synthesis of the pyrazole
analogue resulted in the formation of a single isomer (13), the corresponding isozazole analogue was obtained as a 50:50 mixture
of isomers (11a,b). In each case, the addition
of the double bond resulted in an improvement in affinity for Asyn
and Aβ fibrils but not tau fibrils (Table 2). However, both compounds had a 4-5-fold
higher selectivity for Asyn versus Aβ fibrils.

Molecular-modeling
studies were conducted to identify the molecular
properties important for binding to Asyn fibrils. The modeling studies
described below were performed on 11b because subsequent
in vitro studies of the tritiated analogue were conducted with this
isomer. The structural conformation of 11b and in vitro
binding studies of [3H]11b will be reported
separately.

The three-dimensional geometric and chemical properties
from the
minimized structure of each compound are shown in Table 3. The measurement of geometric
properties, including dihedral angles Ø and
ψ and angle θ are illustrated in Figure 2. A small dihedral angle Ø (−179.1° to −180°) was observed between
the central enone/5-member heteroaromatic group and the thiazole/benzothiazole
group in compounds 4–13. The dihedral angle ψ
for the chalcone series (4–9, ψ = −35.6°
± 1.1°) was greater than those for the isoxazole and pyrazole
analogues (10–13, ψ = 0.2° ± 0.3°),
indicating that the isoxazole and pyrazole analogues are relatively
flat compared to the chalcone analogues. The angle θ represents
the linearity in shape among the central group and the pendant aromatic
groups in each compound. The angle θ for compounds 10–13 (θ = 156.3° ± 6.4°) was smaller than that for
compounds 4–9 (θ = 130.4° ± 2.4°),
suggesting that the isoxazole and pyrazole analogues have a more linear
geometry relative to the chalcone analogues. Overall, the isoxazole
and pyrazole analogues are relatively flat and have a more linear
geometry relative to the chalcone analogues, resulting in a higher
affinity for Asyn fibrils (10–13Ki = 18.5–162.5 nM vs Ki = 53.0–906.0 nM for 4–9) and a better
selectivity for Asyn versus Aβ fibrils (5 to >7 folds for 10–13 vs 0 to >9 folds for 4–9).

With respect to substitutions
of the phenyl group in the chalcone
series, compounds with the dimethylamino group (5 and 8) showed a higher accessible surface area (4 vs 5: 529.4 vs 558.3 Å2; 7 vs 8: 459.4 vs 488.3 Å2) and a lower
polar surface area (4 vs 5: 39.7 vs 32.7
Å2; 7 vs 8: 38.7 vs 32.7
Å2) as compared to the compounds with a methoxy group
(4 and 7). The nitro-containing compounds 6 and 9 have a lower accessible surface area
(6: 519.0 Å2, and 9: 449.0
Å2) and a higher polar surface area (both 6 and 9 = 81.2 Å2). Although the accessible
and polar surface areas showed a trend in an improved affinity (Table 1) for Aβ fibrils
(4 vs 5: Ki =
353 vs 91 nM; 7 vs 8: Ki = >500 vs 505 nM) and a reduced affinity for Asyn
fibrils
(4 vs 5: Ki =
531 vs 906 nM; 7 vs 8: Ki = 53 vs 96 nM) to the compounds with the methoxy group
versus dimethylamino group, the tendency did not consistently show
in the nitro-containing compounds. This suggests that these properties
may not be good indicators to improve affinity or selectivity for
Asyn, Aβ, or tau fibrils.

The isoxazole compound 10, pyrazole compound 12, and chalcone compound 7 shared the same topological
diameter (i.e., 11 bonds), had a similar shape attribute (7, 10, and 12 = 15.1, 16.1, and 16.1), and
a similar range of accessible surface area (7, 10, and 12 = 459.4, 454.5, and 460.7 Å2). There was a tilt in angle ψ of the benzene ring in 7 (ψ = −36.0°) (Figure 3b), whereas this angle was close to zero
in compounds 10 (ψ= 0.5°) and 12 (ψ = 0.0°). The thiazole ring in the minimized structure
was in the opposite orientation for chalcone analog 7 relative to the cyclic compounds 10 and 12. Therefore, the hydrogen bond acceptors or donor (i.e., NH of the
pyrazole ring) are located on the same side of 10 and 12. This may be one of the factors that resulted in the affinity
(Table 2) of 10 (Ki = 134 nM) and 12 (Ki = 163 nM) for Asyn fibrils being
lower than that of 7 (Ki =
53 nM).

isoxazole compounds 10 and 11b. (a)
Compound 11b shows a flatter angle θ and is closer
to linear shape as compared to 7 and 10.
The thiazole ring of compound 7 is in the reverse position
to 10 and 11b. (b) View of 90° rotation
of each compound. A dihedral angle ψ = −36.0° is
shown in compound 7. Compounds 10 and 11b were close to flat. The distance of hydrogen bond acceptors
from the central group to the methoxy group is 8.44 Å for compound 7, shorter for cyclized compound 10 (7.72 Å),
and greater for compound 11b by the introduced double
bond (9.98 Å). Red labeled: dihedral angle Ø. Green labeled: dihedral angle ψ.

Introduction of a double bond into the isoxazole and pyrazole
derivatives
increased the accessible surface area (10 and 12 = 454.5–460.7 Å2 vs 508.9–514.4 Å2 for 11b and 13) and topological
diameter (10 and 12 = 11.0 bonds vs 13.0
bonds for 11b and 13), which resulted in
an improvement in affinity for both Asyn (10 and 12 vs 11b and 13, Ki = 134–163 vs 19–59 nM) and Aβ fibrils
(10 and 12 vs 11b and 13, Ki = >1000 vs 92–327
nM) (Table 2).

We also observed that the intramolecular distance between hydrogen
bond acceptors may be one of the factors influencing the binding affinity
to Asyn, that is, for chalcone analog 7, the distance
between the carbonyl oxygen and the oxygen of the methoxy group was
8.44 Å, and its affinity for Asyn was 53 nM. For the isoxazole
compound 10, the distance between the isoxazole oxygen
and the oxygen of the methoxy group was shorter at 7.72 Å, and
its affinity for Asyn was lower (Ki =
134 nM). The distance between the isoxazole oxygen and the oxygen
of the methoxy group in analog 11b was 9.98 Å, and
its affinity for Asyn was 19 nM. Therefore, the rank order potency
for binding to Asyn was 11b > 7 > 10, which had the same order for distance between the two
different oxygen atoms (9.98 > 8.44 > 7.72 Å) (Figure 3b). Ono et al.15 have studied the different lengths of the double
bonds
in chalcone analogues; it also showed the different distances between
the carbonyl oxygen and the nitrogen of dimethylamino. An extension
of the molecular length increased the binding affinity for Asyn fibrils,
but no influence for Aβ fibrils, although in our study, the
binding affinities for Aβ fibrils were also improved from Ki > 1000 nM (10) to Ki = 91.5 nM (11) when the intramolecular
distance between hydrogen bond acceptors increased. This may be caused
by the length differences of the β-sheets in Asyn, Aβ,
and tau fibrils. Additionally, it may be due to the binding mode differences
between ligands and fibrils. The hydrogen bond may play a more important
role in the binding affinity for Asyn than for Aβ or tau fibrils.
The observation is based on three of our compounds; more SAR studies
and investigation of the interaction between ligands and fibrils are
needed for understanding the influence of intramolecular distance
between hydrogen bond acceptors.

The results of the molecular-modeling
studies indicate that the
molecular shape, topographical diameter, and orientation and distance
between H-bond acceptors are important in determining the affinity
for Asyn fibrils. The studies described above have also led to the
identification of a novel compound, 11, that has a good
affinity for Asyn fibrils and a modest selectivity for Asyn versus
Aβ fibrils. This compound represents a good lead structure for
further SAR studies aimed at the development of a PET radiotracer
for imaging Asyn aggregates in vivo with PET. Additional SAR studies
of compound 11 are currently ongoing in our group.

Binding Assay
The Asyn, Aβ, and tau fibrils used
in this study were prepared as previous described.13 Additional characterization of the Asyn fibril preparation
including atomic force microscopy imaging has also been previously
reported.23 Thioflavin-T competition assay
studies were also performed following the protocol in a previous paper
by Chu et al.13 In briefly, competition
assays used a fixed concentration (1 μM) of Asyn, Aβ,
or tau fibrils, consisting of 3 μM, 50 nM, and 4 μM of
Thioflavin-T, respectively. The competitor reaction was diluted in
30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and added to the
reactions in varying concentrations. The reactions were incubated
at room temperature for 1.5 h before quantifying the bound ligand.
Fluorescence was determined in a BioTek plate reader using a 440/30
excitation filter and a 485/20 emission filter. Data were analyzed
using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0) to obtain EC50 values by fitting the data to the one-site competitive binding equation. Ki values were calculated from EC50 values using the equation Ki = EC50/(1 + [radioligand]/Kd). The
average and standard deviation of Ki values
were calculated from the results of two competition assays for each
fibrils.

Molecular Modeling
All structures were drawn on ChemDraw
Profession 15.1 (PerkinElmer Informatics, Inc.) and then imported
to Chem3D Ultra 15.1 (PerkinElmer Informatics, Inc.) to minimize individual
structures by MMFF94 force field for further geometric characteristic
and chemical property measurements. Chem3D Ultra 15.1 program was
also applied to measure the chemical properties. Connolly accessible
surface area was calculated by the ChemPropStd property module. Polar
surface, topological diameter, and shape attribute were measured by
the molecular topology property module. Three-dimensional geometric
characteristics were measured based on the minimized structures by
using Visual Molecular Dynamics program.24 As illustrated in Figure 2, the dihedral angles Ø and ψ
between the central group and the pedant aromatic groups were measured
to evaluate the torsion degree of each compound. The angle θ
among the central group and the pendant aromatic groups was calculated
to measure the linearity in shape. A molecular visualization system
from open source package, PyMOL (pymol.org), was used for the three-dimensional display.
